      "As, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.\n",
      "Smote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.\n",
      "Entered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the altar.\n",

      "Hushed by the scene he beholds, and the awful presence of sorrow.\n",
      "Moved on their way, unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals.\n",
      "Then sat he down at her side, and they wept together in silence.\n",
      "Seizing the rocks and the rivers, and piling huge shadows together.\n",
      "Gleamed on the sky and the sea, and the ships that lay in the roadstead.\n",
      "Thrust through their folds and withdrawn, like the quivering hands of a martyr.\n",
      "These things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard.\n",
      "Came on the evening breeze, by the barking of dogs interrupted.\n",
      "Or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river.\n",
      "Broke through their folds and fences, and madly rushed o'er the meadows.\n",
      "Motionless lay his form, from which the soul had departed.\n",
      "Knelt at her father's side, and wailed aloud in her terror.\n",
      "Then in a swoon she sank, and lay with her head on his bosom.\n",

      "Leaving behind them the dead on the shore, and the village in ruins.\n",
      "Exile without an end, and without an example in story.\n",
      "Strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the Banks of Newfoundland.\n",
      "Deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth.\n",
      "Asked of the earth but a grave, and no longer a friend nor a fireside.\n",
      "Written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards.\n",
      "Lowly and meek in spirit, and patiently suffering all things.\n",
      "Camp-fires long consumed, and bones that bleach in the sunshine.\n",
      "Into the east again, from whence it late had arisen.\n",

      "Sorrow and silence are strong, and patient endurance is godlike.\n",
      "Cheered by the good man's words, Evangeline labored and waited.\n",
      "Happy, at length, if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet.\n",
      "Floated a cumbrous boat, that was rowed by Acadian boatmen.\n",
      "On the Acadian coast, and the prairies of fair Opelousas.\n",
      "With them Evangeline went, and her guide, the Father Felician.\n",
      "Night after night, by their blazing fires, encamped on its borders.\n",
      "Sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward.\n",
      "Which, like a network of steel, extended in every direction.\n",
      "Waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals.\n",
      "Or by the owl, as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter.\n",
      "Down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin.\n",
      "Strange forebodings of ill, unseen and that cannot be compassed.\n",
      "Shrinks and closes the heart, ere the stroke of doom has attained it.\n",
      "Floated before her eyes, and beckoned her on through the moonlight.\n",
      "It was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom.\n",
      "And every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer.\n",
      "Sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams, blew a blast on his bugle.\n",
      "Breaking the seal of silence, and giving tongues to the forest.\n",
      "Soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music.\n",
      "And, when the echoes had ceased, like a sense of pain was the silence.\n",
      "Mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator.\n",
      "Lay, in the golden sun, the lakes of the Atchafalaya.\n",
      "Lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen.\n",
      "Near to whose shores they glided along, invited to slumber.\n",
      "Soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended.\n",
      "Over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar.\n",
      "Were the swift humming-birds, that flitted from blossom to blossom.\n",
      "Such was the vision Evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it.\n",
      "Lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial.\n",
      "Urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers.\n",
      "Northward its prow was turned, to the land of the bison and beaver.\n",
      "At the helm sat a youth, with countenance thoughtful and care-worn.\n",
      "Somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written.\n",
      "Sought in the Western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow.\n",
      "Angel of God was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden.\n",
      "Swiftly they glided away, like the shade of a cloud on the prairie.\n",
      "Something says in my heart that near me Gabriel wanders.\n",
      "\"Daughter, thy words are not idle; nor are they to me without meaning.\n",
      "Is as the tossing buoy, that betrays where the anchor is hidden.\n",
      "Therefore trust to thy heart, and to what the world calls illusions.\n",
      "On the banks of the TÃªche are the towns of St. Maur and St. Martin.\n",
      "There the long-absent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold.\n",
      "Bending above, and resting its dome on the walls of the forest.\n",
      "With these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey.\n",
      "Seemed all on fire at the touch, and melted and mingled together.\n",
      "Floated the boat, with its dripping oars, on the motionless water.\n",
      "Glowed with the light of love, as the skies and waters around her.\n",
      "That the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen.\n",
      "Seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied Bacchantes.\n",
      "Shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches.\n",
      "Sounds of a horn they heard, and the distant lowing of cattle.\n",
      "Haunt of the humming-bird and the bee, extended around it.\n",
      "Into the evening air, a thin blue column of smoke rose.\n",
      "Into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending.\n",
      "Stood a cluster of trees, with tangled cordage of grape-vines.\n",
      "Sat a herdsman, arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin.\n",
      "Gazed on the peaceful scene, with the lordly look of its master.\n",

      "Wildly and sweet and far, through the still damp air of the evening.\n",
      "Rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean.\n",
      "And the whole mass became a cloud, a shade in the distance.\n",
      "Saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him.\n",
      "When they beheld his face, they recognized Basil the blacksmith.\n",
      "Hearty his welcome was, as he led his guests to the garden.\n",
      "Laughing and weeping by turns, or sitting silent and thoughtful.\n",
      "Over Evangeline's face at the words of Basil a shade passed.\n",
      "All her o'erburdened heart gave way, and she wept and lamented.\n",
      "\"Be of good cheer, my child; it is only to-day he departed.\n",
      "Foolish boy! he has left me alone with my herds and my horses.\n",
      "Could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence.\n",
      "Unto the town of Adayes to trade for mules with the Spaniards.\n",
      "Hunting for furs in the forests, on rivers trapping the beaver.\n",
      "He is not far on his way, and the Fates and the streams are against him.\n",
      "Borne aloft on his comrades' arms, came Michael the fiddler.\n",
      "Far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle.\n",
      "Each one thought in his heart, that he, too, would go and do likewise.\n",
      "Waited his late return; and they rested and feasted together.\n",
      "Brighter than these, shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight.\n",
      "Poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion.\n",
      "Here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer.\n",
      "Smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil, as a keel through the water.\n",
      "More in a single night than a whole Canadian summer.\n",
      "With a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses.\n",
      "Suddenly paused, with a pinch of snuff halfway to his nostrils.\n",
      "Sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda.\n",
      "Who had been summoned all to the house of Basil the Herdsman.\n",
      "Drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together.\n",
      "Dreamlike, with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments.\n",
      "Came o'er her heart, and unseen she stole forth into the garden.\n",
      "Like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit.\n",
      "Unto the night, as it went its way, like a silent Carthusian.\n",
      "Passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie.\n",
      "Farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence.\n",
      "With the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal.\n",
      "Down to the river's brink, where the boatmen already were waiting.\n",
      "Blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert.\n",
      "Gabriel left the village, and took the road of the prairies.\n",
      "Like the great chords of a harp, in loud and solemn vibrations.\n",
      "Gabriel far had entered, with hunters and trappers behind him.\n",
      "Followed his flying steps, and thought each day to o'ertake him.\n",
      "When they had reached the place, they found only embers and ashes.\n",
      "Showed them her lakes of light, that retreated and vanished before them.\n",
      "Wore deep traces of sorrow, and patience as great as her sorrow.\n",
      "On the buffalo-meat and the venison cooked on the embers.\n",
      "All the tale of her love, with its pleasures, and pains, and reverses.\n",
      "Hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed.\n",
      "She in turn related her love and all its disasters.\n",
      "Till she beheld him no more, though she followed far into the forest.\n",
      "And never more returned, nor was seen again by her people.\n",
      "Seemed like enchanted ground, and her swarthy guest the enchantress.\n",
      "Touching the sombre leaves, and embracing and filling the woodland.\n",
      "As the cold, poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow.\n",
      "That, like the Indian maid, she, too, was pursuing a phantom.\n",
      "With this thought she slept, and the fear and the phantom had vanished.\n",
      "Dwells in his little village the Black Robe chief of the Mission.\n",
      "Saw the tents of the Christians, the tents of the Jesuit Mission.\n",
      "Looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it.\n",
      "Mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches.\n",
      "Knelt on the swarded floor, and joined in the evening devotions.\n",
      "And, with words of kindness, conducted them into his wigwam.\n",
      "Feasted, and slaked their thirst from the water-gourd of the teacher.\n",
      "Fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed.\n",
      "But at the crooked laughed, and called it a thief in the cornfield.\n",
      "Even the blood-red ear to Evangeline brought not her lover.\n",
      "But they beguile us, and lead us astray, and their odor is deadly.\n",
      "Sounded sweet upon wold and in wood, yet Gabriel came not.\n",
      "Sweeter than song of bird, or hue or odor of blossom.\n",
      "Gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the Saginaw river.\n",

      "Where all men were equal, and all were brothers and sisters.\n",

      "So are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying.\n",
