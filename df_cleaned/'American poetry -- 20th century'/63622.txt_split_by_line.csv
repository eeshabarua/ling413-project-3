,Poem Title,line
19,CONTENTS,the youth is persuaded that he will be rather more than less himself
26,CONTENTS,he is in doubt whether to admit real trouble to a place beside the
35,CONTENTS,out of the winter things he fashions a story of modern love
37,CONTENTS,he calls on change through the violence of the elements
39,CONTENTS,he discovers that the greatness of love lies not in forwardlooking
42,CONTENTS,nor yet in any spur it may be to ambition
52,CONTENTS,he is shown by a dream how really well it is with him
63,CONTENTS,he resolves to become intelligible at least to himself since there
66,CONTENTS,and to know definitely what he thinks about the soul
84,CONTENTS,he sees days slipping from him that were the best for what they
103,CONTENTS,i do not see why i should eer turn back
106,CONTENTS,and long to know if still i held them dear
107,CONTENTS,they would not find me changed from him they knew
266,CONTENTS,how the cold creeps as the fire dies at length
412,CONTENTS,i pass by that way in the gloaming with mary
413,CONTENTS,i wonder i say who the owner of those is
415,CONTENTS,but one we must ask if we want any roses
416,CONTENTS,so we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
418,CONTENTS,and turn and go up to the open door boldly
431,CONTENTS,and grants us by silence the boon of her roses
456,CONTENTS,in the abyss of odor and rustle at my back
461,CONTENTS,i brought not here to read it seems but hold
464,CONTENTS,for whom these lines when they shall greet her eye
493,CONTENTS,you have only to ask me and i can tell
510,CONTENTS,not far but near i stood and saw it all
512,CONTENTS,and the sweet pang it cost me not to call
515,CONTENTS,for the wood wakes and you are here for proof
541,CONTENTS,and if by moon i have too much of these
542,CONTENTS,i have but to turn on my arm and lo
553,CONTENTS,there was never a sound beside the wood but one
554,CONTENTS,and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground
555,CONTENTS,what was it it whispered i knew not well myself
556,CONTENTS,perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun
558,CONTENTS,and that was why it whispered and did not speak
559,CONTENTS,it was no dream of the gift of idle hours
560,CONTENTS,or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf
561,CONTENTS,anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
562,CONTENTS,to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows
566,CONTENTS,my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make
747,CONTENTS,the dew was gone that made his blade so keen
751,CONTENTS,but he had gone his way the grass all mown
755,CONTENTS,but as i said it swift there passed me by
759,CONTENTS,and once i marked his flight go round and round
761,CONTENTS,and then he flew as far as eye could see
764,CONTENTS,and would have turned to toss the grass to dry
765,CONTENTS,but he turned first and led my eye to look
769,CONTENTS,i left my place to know them by their name
773,CONTENTS,nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him
781,CONTENTS,but glad with him i worked as with his aid
784,CONTENTS,with one whose thought i had not hoped to reach
840,CONTENTS,his skin and his hair and his eyes were gray
877,CONTENTS,though i knew what i hunted was no true god
878,CONTENTS,it was just as the light was beginning to fail
888,CONTENTS,i felt as a fool to have been so caught
985,CONTENTS,there is none left to mourn thee in the fields
1001,CONTENTS,that fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind
1005,CONTENTS,it seemed god let thee flutter from his gentle clasp
