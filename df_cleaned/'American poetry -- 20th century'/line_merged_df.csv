0,CONTENTS,the youth is persuaded that he will be rather more than less himself
1,CONTENTS,he is in doubt whether to admit real trouble to a place beside the
2,CONTENTS,out of the winter things he fashions a story of modern love
3,CONTENTS,he calls on change through the violence of the elements
4,CONTENTS,he discovers that the greatness of love lies not in forwardlooking
5,CONTENTS,nor yet in any spur it may be to ambition
6,CONTENTS,he is shown by a dream how really well it is with him
7,CONTENTS,he resolves to become intelligible at least to himself since there
8,CONTENTS,and to know definitely what he thinks about the soul
9,CONTENTS,he sees days slipping from him that were the best for what they
10,CONTENTS,i do not see why i should eer turn back
11,CONTENTS,and long to know if still i held them dear
12,CONTENTS,they would not find me changed from him they knew
13,CONTENTS,how the cold creeps as the fire dies at length
14,CONTENTS,i pass by that way in the gloaming with mary
15,CONTENTS,i wonder i say who the owner of those is
16,CONTENTS,but one we must ask if we want any roses
17,CONTENTS,so we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
18,CONTENTS,and turn and go up to the open door boldly
19,CONTENTS,and grants us by silence the boon of her roses
20,CONTENTS,in the abyss of odor and rustle at my back
21,CONTENTS,i brought not here to read it seems but hold
22,CONTENTS,for whom these lines when they shall greet her eye
23,CONTENTS,you have only to ask me and i can tell
24,CONTENTS,not far but near i stood and saw it all
25,CONTENTS,and the sweet pang it cost me not to call
26,CONTENTS,for the wood wakes and you are here for proof
27,CONTENTS,and if by moon i have too much of these
28,CONTENTS,i have but to turn on my arm and lo
29,CONTENTS,there was never a sound beside the wood but one
30,CONTENTS,and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground
31,CONTENTS,what was it it whispered i knew not well myself
32,CONTENTS,perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun
33,CONTENTS,and that was why it whispered and did not speak
34,CONTENTS,it was no dream of the gift of idle hours
35,CONTENTS,or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf
36,CONTENTS,anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
37,CONTENTS,to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows
38,CONTENTS,my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make
39,CONTENTS,the dew was gone that made his blade so keen
40,CONTENTS,but he had gone his way the grass all mown
41,CONTENTS,but as i said it swift there passed me by
42,CONTENTS,and once i marked his flight go round and round
43,CONTENTS,and then he flew as far as eye could see
44,CONTENTS,and would have turned to toss the grass to dry
45,CONTENTS,but he turned first and led my eye to look
46,CONTENTS,i left my place to know them by their name
47,CONTENTS,nor yet to draw one thought of ours to him
48,CONTENTS,but glad with him i worked as with his aid
49,CONTENTS,with one whose thought i had not hoped to reach
50,CONTENTS,his skin and his hair and his eyes were gray
51,CONTENTS,though i knew what i hunted was no true god
52,CONTENTS,it was just as the light was beginning to fail
53,CONTENTS,i felt as a fool to have been so caught
54,CONTENTS,there is none left to mourn thee in the fields
55,CONTENTS,that fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind
56,CONTENTS,it seemed god let thee flutter from his gentle clasp
