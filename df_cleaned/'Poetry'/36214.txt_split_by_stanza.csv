15,TO MY FATHER,"Years can not cloud the light of your clear eyes, Steadfast and bright with high integrity; Nor rob your spirit of the strength that lies On those firm lips; nor dim the purity Of a high soul, which bears the shield of Love Untarnished, as it was upon the day When One, with tender faith, desired to prove Her ""Royal Knight,"" and gave her heart away. Bear her bright shield, and smile, as years roll by-- Years that have crowned you with the priceless crown Of steadfast faith and worldwide charity-- Until you reap the joy that you have sown, In that near land, where, with a light divine, The eyes you love through all the ages shine. "

73,ACT I.,"_A multitude of citizens gathered therein. Disturbance shown among them by sullen looks and murmurings. Four citizens, two in patrician and two in plebeian garments, confer together._ "
74,ACT I.,"_1st Cit._ Enough, enough! I see we all agree Upon this common cause of our grievance; Our ranks, our unmixed blood, our differences, Are all forgotten--nay, methinks they shall In time together mingle when our blood Shall be poured forth in this most righteous cause. "
75,ACT I.,"_2nd Cit._ As ever art thou eloquent, O Marius, And just; Brutus himself were not more so. Patrician and plebeian, equalized By common woe, together whisper menace To those who work such havoc as, indeed, Was never known in Rome until to-day. "
76,ACT I.,"_3rd Cit._ Ye two are nobles; we, the commons are; Yet all are leveled by the grief we feel For Rome, our mother city, who so low Hath fall'n. Hark! the multitude itself Is wroth as we, yet, e'en as we, it lacks The courage needful for this fierce occasion. "
77,ACT I.,"_4th Cit._ Ay, list indeed! Mark how the murmur swells! "
78,ACT I.,"[_They turn, and follow with their eyes the gaze of the Roman mob._ "
79,ACT I.,"_Voices of lictors_ (_without_). Make way, ye Romans, way for the noble Ten! "
80,ACT I.,_3rd Cit._ Pah! they announce them like to royal kings! 
82,ACT I.,_Multitude._ All hail to the lawgivers! Life and peace Unto the Ten! 
83,ACT I.,"_2nd Cit._ Jove's lightning strike them down, The turncoats! Ah, the cowards and the curs! Perfidious gang of fawners! Do they thus Forget their wrongs in the wrongdoer's presence, Or veil them with that slime, false loyalty? "
84,ACT I.,"[_Enter the Ten Decemvirs, each preceded by twelve lictors armed with fasces._ "
85,ACT I.,_4th Cit._ Lo! the presumption! How each lictor bears Amongst his rods an axe to indicate That life and death lie in his master's word. Once was each tyrant pleased with one attendant The way to clear--now must they number twelve. 
86,ACT I.,"[_The Decemvirs pause a space, the while their leader, Appius Claudius, addresses the assembled citizens._ "
87,ACT I.,"_Appius._ Ye Roman citizens! Unto our ears Murmurings hath arrived laden with strife; And though this day ye have protested loud Your loyalty, and hailed us with acclaim, Ye seem but ill-content. This must not be. We have been lenient to every class-- What ye demand in reason ye receive. Ye called for written laws, and lo! they hang Within the Forum that all eyes may read. Yet, mark ye! Read not only, but obey, Else blood shall pour in torrents on these stones. "
89,ACT I.,"What! would ye show your teeth, ye nobles brave, Would bare your fangs, O ye plebeian dogs! Your teeth are drawn, patricians, and your fangs Are dull, indeed, ye curs!      [_A hissing protest._ What, open schism? Ho, lictors, strike! Ah! would ye calmer grow? Lictors, enough! Now must we on. Our time Is pressing. "
90,ACT I.,"[_As he is on the point of departing with his colleagues, his gaze is arrested by the passing of a girl, clad all in white, attended by her nurse, through the Forum._ "
91,ACT I.,"(_To a companion._) Now, by the ghost of Ixion, behold Yon perfect vision of most perfect beauty. Enchanting grace! Exquisite featuring! Youth lightly shadowed by young womanhood! My passions, Oppius, are all awake. Aflame and spreading fast! Why, I would burn All Rome to own her, touch her, feel her near; I would receive the curses of the gods, Be hurled to lowest Hades, and endure The tortures set for Tantalus himself If I might call her mine. Her kiss would prove Sufficient food for me, her liquid eyes Would quench my thirst if I should look within And see the tears or draw the starry light Into my soul! O, Appius, ye are stricken! "
92,ACT I.,"_Oppius._ Peace, peace, mine Appius, the maid is gone-- Thy looks are wild, thy features are convulsed With passion. "
93,ACT I.,"_1st Cit._ See, Hortensius, yon man? What ails him? Like a madman is his gaze, And horrid is his flaming countenance. "
95,ACT I.,"_Appius._ Hands off, O, foolish man, for I am dead To protest. I have been by lightning stricken. "
96,ACT I.,"_Oppius._         It is, indeed, too passionate to be The wound from Eros' feathered shaft. "
97,ACT I.,"_Appius_ (_groaning_).         Ah! God! Where has she gone? I can not see her face Nor matchless form within the dreary crowd, Women I spy in plenty. What a mob Of uncouth shapes and homely featuring These females are! She was a Cynthia, And all beside her, hideous and bold Bacchantes. I'll a lictor straight despatch, To seize on her, for she belongs to me. "
98,ACT I.,"_Oppius._ Nay, fool! Rash fool! Thou art not Jupiter In power, that thou darest thus to seize, In open daylight, objects of thy lust, When they are daughters of free citizens. Some shadow of excuse must herald such Bold actions, lest the rabble rise in arms, As in the days of fair Lucretia! Thou canst presume, and yet in thy presumption Play the sly part of virtue, ay, and justice, Nor seem a mad and bigoted abductor. I know the maid; a blameless child of one Virginius, a soldier and a pleb. Wait, wait, and on the morrow form thy plans, But for this moment let the matter rest, If thou art prudent. Come, let's on; the mob Follows thy gaze, noting thy steadfast look. "
99,ACT I.,"_Appius._ Speed morrow then. For I am now no better Than madman; I, who hold the whole of Rome Under my thumb, am raving only for Nor heaven nor earth, nor power, nay, nor fame, But for the captivation of a maid-- But for Virginia. Onward, let us on! I'll march into the grim, gray gates of eve And meet the morrow ere it hath arisen, Tear down the portals of the night and force My way into the chamber where the morn Dozes, a lovely slothful soul of hope, And seizing on her, madly I'll demand Virginia!      [_Exeunt._ "
103,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Horatius._                 And will dare more, Until Rome wakens from her lethargy And is herself again. "
104,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Marius._             Till then we wait, Enduring insult, tyranny, from him, The common enemy of nobleman And pleb. "
105,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,_Horatius._ Alas! once was he common friend To both--our lawgiver; what changed him so? 
106,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Marius._ A worm of pride that gnawed into his heart, A blast of fiery desert wind that dried, Withered and seared his noble disposition. To-day he is a monster, where he was But yesterday a leader and a god. "
107,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,_Horatius._ He angered the patricians by his show Of democratic policy; the plebs By barring intermarriage 'twixt the two Opposing classes!      [_Enter Virginius and Icilius._ 
108,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Virginius._ Blessings, health to you! Good wishes of a Roman unto Romans. "
109,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Horatius_ (_bitterly_). Say rather, helpless, sullen, brooding curs! We are no more--methinks _thou_ art no more; Nor even thou, Icilius, our tribune. There are no free, courageous sons of Rome, But victims only, cowed beneath the lash Of the Decemvirs--curses on their heads! "
110,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Virginius._ Methinks I'm not the dog that thou hast said, For 'tis my part and wish to play the man. The name of Appius I do despise, And only bide my time to bury it Deep in the soil, along with him who bears Its weight. Although I will not fling myself Upon the altar of Unreason as A bootless sacrifice, yet am I still Nor dog, nor worm, but one who waits and prays, Nor prays alone, but puzzles out his plan Of action. No, nor plans alone, but strives; And striving, must achieve, unless the hand Of sudden Death come in to tear the web. Friends, we are hard pressed and we pant in pain, Yet tyrants, howsoever strong, are still Weaker than Justice and are shorter-lived Than Liberty, the queen whom Justice serves. Because our wrongs are heavy must we brood, And chafe, and curse our stars and Appius? What war was ever closed successfully With sullen warriors and men untrained, Unready or undone by foul Despair? "
111,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Icilius._ Thou hast inspired me and curbed my wrath, Which held in it no reason, all unbound, Ready to leap a lion on its prey. Ay, there's a time for all things. I shall wait, Knowing, Virginius, that thy words are true. Wisdom, the gods be thanked, hath never flowed Forth from thy lips in words of honeyed sounds, Nor yet in pompous phrases burdened down With ponderous eloquence, but bold and frank, Shining as bright and ringing forth as true As thy good sword that thou hast borne so well In camp, palestra, or in battle-field. "
112,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Virginius._ My words are bold, for I am full of grief At men's delinquency and heavy souls; Frank--ay; because 'tis late to talk in riddles Or metaphors, that veil the precious truth Within; shining with fervor, ringing true, Because the cause I do uphold is true As life and death is real. "
113,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Horatius._         Thine eloquence Is worthy of a better hearing than This little company. I would that thou Wouldst lead us into action, noble pleb. "
114,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Virginius._ My duties are at present with mine own-- With her, my fair ewe-lamb; when she becomes The spouse of this our friend and our tribune, Virginius shall owe himself to none, But feel compelled the Commonwealth alone To serve. And here's my hand in oath that I Shall serve it well! The gods help Appius! "
117,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Sic._ And Heaven's favor unto you, my friends. How now! All deep in sombre conference? "
118,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Icilius_ (_impetuously_). Sicinius! What curse hath come to Rome, That bends her proud and regal head beneath The yoke of shame? The collar of the serf Hangs heavy round her haughty neck. Ye gods! The mightly Romulus, methinks, must find The grave a cell that keeps him from his Rome; How must his mighty spirit chafe when he Receiveth tidings from the newly dead, Concerning this, his city, now so low Amid the dust of Wrong and Bigotry! Tell us, thou man of action, what bold move We needs must make. Oh! be our OEdipus! "
119,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Horatius._ Hist, noble tribune! Favor silence. These Are times of peril; cast thou Caution's die. "
120,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Icilius_ (_amazed_). What! knowest thou not this man, Sicinius? He who has bearded all the noble Ten, He whose brave words of indignation ring From hill to hill of Rome? Sicinius! "
121,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Horatius_ (_sullenly_). I have been absent from the town these twelve Long moons, nor know I all that thou dost know. "
122,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Icilius._ Why, man, look not so sour and so sad. "
123,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Virginius._ Peace, youths! Sicinius hath but little chance To speak his mind. I beg of thee that thou, Good friend, expound thy views as to these days Of tyranny, for Romans are at bay. "
124,SCENE II--A STREET IN ROME.,"_Sic._ If I should speak, then would I speak myself Into my grave; so twist mine earnest tongue As soon would wring it from its fevered roots, Mine eyeballs blind themselves with fiery tears Of love for Rome; my life would withered be With all the curses breathing forth, aflame With hate for Appius! Oh, ye gods! in what Have we outraged you that we now are cursed With such a blight as Famine never cast Over the fields of plenty, withering Alike the grain and the wild wayside bloom, Sweeping across the vast, bright lands of peace, And leaving staring Ruin in its way? Oh! Rome, thou much-wronged child of Romulus, That I might break the seals from off thine eyes, And place a flaming sword within thy hand, A watchword in thine ear--""Endure for her Who is thy rightful mistress, Liberty."" A battle-cry upon thy glowing lips, ""Onward!"" A prayer within thy mighty heart, And prophecy to stir thy godlike soul To action. But the times are ripening!      [_A pause._ Could I relate thy wrongs, I would not cease, Nor spare myself, but speaking, sink to earth, Worn with the task. Yet who can number them That are as numberless as Heaven's stars? I say, as I have said to you before, We Romans will again secede, again March, in a body, to the Sacred Mount, And threaten as of old another Rome, A nobler Rome, a Rome unbound and free, To found thereon, or else a revolution, Bloody and merciless and full of horrors, Shall ravage Rome, but we be satisfied. The fire and the sword hath ready tongues; They fawn not to the great, nor spare the high, They lick and bite nor fail in eloquence. So, to the fire and the sword must we Resort; for city, home, and cherished ones Demand that guilty blood, as a libation, Be poured in answer to the blood of Rome, Which crieth to her children from the ground! "
128,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_The curtain, rising, discovers a bondmaid in the center of a spacious court, filling her pitcher at the fountain. It is midday, and the light streams down from above, flooding the entire space with radiance. The woman sings in an undertone, as she turns to water the roses twined around the columns in the background. Enter Marcus Claudius. He approaches the maiden, leisurely._ "
129,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,_Marc._ Ah! pretty one! Fortune has favored me! I enter in due time to proffer aid. 
130,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Slave._ Nay, shame on thee, a man free-born, to thus Address a bondmaid, when there is no need. "
131,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Marc._ Thy humble mien is fitting, girl, but I Am modest, and, thus far, will graciously Demean myself. "
132,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Slave._      Demean thyself, indeed! I only mocked thee, fool; thy proffered aid I scorn. Low-born plebeian, who art thou, To set thyself above a child of kings? "
133,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Marc._ (_angrily_). Ha! Have a care! Take heed! Thy saucy tongue Eludes thee, mischief hungry. Fairest slave, But for that very fairness which is thine, I'd have thee lashed by him who favors me! "
134,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Slave_ (_wheeling about in scorn_). Who shelters, who supports, who uses thee, And for his own vile ends! Lends thee his brains, His power and knowledge for thy petty, sly Returns. He, fierce and false; thou, mean and small; He, merciless; thou, only Marcus' friend-- And both unscrupulous as Mercury. "
135,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Marc._ (_furiously_). Thou art too scathing in thy judgment, damsel! "
136,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Slave._ Nay, I am mild to what thou dost deserve. "
137,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Marc._ How darest thou, a slave, to judge me so? "
138,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Slave._ King Tarquin, called Superbus, or the Proud, He was mine ancestor. And I, alone Left of his line, in bondage languish. _Thou_,-- What canst thou boast of? Of the blood of plebs, Yet lower e'en than they who gave thee birth; Despised of all, for thou art neither slave, Nor free; thou hangest slothlike on the skirts Of mighty men, that they may represent Thy cause--support, succor, and plead for thee, In gratitude for thy poor services. Avaunt! Fawner and client, touch me not! "
139,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"[_She spurns him when he would approach her, and haughtily departs._ "
140,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Marc._ (_gazing after her_). Adieu, thou helpless scorner, chained despiser, Thy tongue hath sought to whip me sore--in vain. A client knows not shame nor injured pride. Nor is he haughty, for the blood of kings Heats not his veins. So Marcus, too, is low, Ready to stoop to aught, however base, To gain his ends. But triumph over triumphs! Marcus will issue forth the conqueror. Flushed with his victory, while other men Lie low and bite the dust because they clung To honor! He, clean void of conscience, sucks The sweets of life down to their sweetest dregs.      [_Pauses._ Ha! who is that? My master hath returned! "
141,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"[_Peers through a curtained doorway on the right. As he retreats, Appius Claudius enters hurriedly. His toga is disordered, his countenance aflame with wine and passion. He throws himself heavily upon a couch._ "
142,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Appius._ Wine, fetch some wine! At once, with no delay! "
143,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Marc._ (_aside_). And drunk as Bacchus at his wedding-feast! (_Aloud._) Which kind, my lord? "
145,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,_Marc._ (_aside_). I need no prophet's eyes to see his end. To Bacchus I assign him with due care.      [_Exit._ 
146,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Appius_ (_in hoarse undertone_). I looked but once, and, looking, she was gone, Leaving me reeling, drunk with loveliness. I have imbibed deeply this day in wine, Yet hath it less intoxicating power Than hath a tremor of her lashes or A flutter of her garments! I am struck, And heavily!      [_He groans and clasps his head with his hands._ Virginia! Elements Are in thy name--tempest and burning flame! My soul is tossed as though it were at sea, My brain is floating on the vacant air, My heart consumed in everlasting fire! "
149,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Appius._     Fill me the cup.      [_Drinks._ Sweet solace and indulgence of the gods, Unequaled nectar, give me satisfaction! Better to me this pleasure than the sight Of fair Elysium. Such ecstasy As is the privilege and portion of Souls freed from Hades and its rack and wheel And snatched to Heaven, can no sweeter be Than is mine ecstasy, when wafted on The summer zephyr, comes this breath, divine, Of nectar and ambrosia in one. Virginia, to myself, to thee, to Love, I drink! And now, my Marcus, sit thee down! I would confer with thee. "
151,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Appius._ Marcus, this morn I made my way in state Through Rome--and, in the market-place, beheld A sight that hath undone me for this day. My heart hath slipped its leash and now is set Hard on the trail, not to be turned aside. "
153,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Appius._'Twas more than vision, thanks to Vulcan be, Who did create that mortal styled a woman, At once a snare, at once a perfect boon; At once a curse, at once a lasting blessing. It was a maid, a lowly, mortal maid, A maid of mean plebeian birth as well, Yet beautiful as though she had arisen From out the golden heart of some fair rose, Or drowsy, dreamy, tempting, fresh and fair, Had issued, shyly, from the troubled depths Of rock-bound spring, a nymph but newly born, And shrinking from the glances of the morn. Virginia, child of one Virginius, Centurion of courage and renown, She burst upon me like a revelation Unto a prophet. She is mine as sure As are the stars possessions of the Night. She'll have no will but mine, no choice but mine; She'll yield her body unto me, until I find the chance to win her heart and soul. I'll hold her and I'll kiss her heart away; I'll chain her soul to mine with links of gold. But whether she shall ever love me true I little care, so that her lips are mine. So that I daily touch her hands and feel Her dusky hair blow cloudlike 'gainst my cheek. Marcus, thou art the man to work my weal, By aiding me in this, mine enterprise. "
154,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,_Marc._ What! Shall I play the game and thou receive The winnings? 
155,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Appius_ (_haughtily_). Ay, assuredly. O, pause, And pausing, see thyself in honest light. Thou art my client; thou to _me_ dost owe Thy safety, standing, possibly thy life. I know the law--I _made_, the law, the while Thou canst not read a letter; as a pleb Few rights are thine--those few I gave thy class At the expense of the patrician favor. Break with me, and thou'lt break thy fortunes, ope Thy chest of troubles, like the silly maid Who brought untold misfortunes on herself And on the world. Assist me and thou'lt gain My favor, keep my needful, strong protection. "
159,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Appius._ Then hearken. Choose some morning, soon or late, And hasten to the market-place. The maid Receiveth schooling there. When she appears, Spring forward boldly, seize her by the arm, (And yet be not too rude in thy demeanor); When all the multitude around demand An explanation, say to them that she Was born of a slave-woman in thy house, Ere thou a client had become. And add That she had been in secret borne away, And, by the wife of one Virginius, Claimed as a child; her own at birth had died, And he, Virginius, kept in ignorance, Grossly deceived, believeth it his flesh And blood. The tale is wild; no proof hast thou, Nor witnesses; and yet it is enough Seeing that I control the Romans as The Fates control the lives of mortal men, And need the barest shadow of excuse To work my will--I, who am autocrat! Assume a righteous air, if that doth lie Within the limits of thy doubtful, rare Accomplishments. When they protest, then say ""To Appius for justice I will go,"" And leave the rest to me. "
160,SCENE I--THE HOUSE OF APPIUS.,"_Marcus._                Ay, leave to thee The cowing of the Roman mob, for that Lieth within the limits of _thy_ rare, Doubtful accomplishments. So let it be. I'll serve thee well--will my returns be worthy The peril of my venture? "
163,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Style of ornaments and hangings very simple. Virginia, bending over her nurse, who is seated in a chair, appears to have just completed the arrangement of the latter's hair._ "
164,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virg._ Nay, now, let be! 'Tis most becoming so. What! would'st thou call't presumptious to assume The style of headdress worn by noble ladies? Foolish Camilla! Thou art nobler far Than many score fine dames, however high They hold their heads or wear their tresses--so! Oh, 'tis entrancing! Stay, I have not done. "
165,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,_Camilla_ (_groaning in mock despair_). Alack! was ever nurse so harried by A maid as silly and as sweet as thou! 
166,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virg._ No, never! for I'm sweet because I've kissed Thy kind old cheek so oft and have imbibed Therefrom the sweetness only found in thee. And I am silly--I suppose, because The gods have made me so. Now, turn about Thy head. How white thy hair of late hath grown! "
168,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virg._ (_passionately caressing her_). Nay, not so! Or if 'tis so, I love each silver thread. Kiss me, Camilla--but I must proceed With this thy toilet. Now is it complete. Oh, Jupiter! it is a work of art! Sweet nurse, thou wilt amaze my father when He catches sight of thee.      [_Seizes a mirror._ Come, view thyself. 'Tis not ill-done, for I have marked the style. Shake not thy head at me, I prithee now. I only sport with thee. Look not so grave. "
169,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Camilla._ Sweet one, because thou art so gay to-day, I fear to-morrow thou wilt be in tears. Excess of spirits bears excess of grief. Thou'rt young and fair as Hero; but to her Misfortune came and loss and heavy woe! "
170,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virg._ Now, thou remindest me of Wisdom's owl-- Croak not so somberly. Thou who art one Whose heart is ever genial with mirth, Wrong'st Nature to cast shadows over youth. "
171,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Camilla_ (_drawing Virginia to her tenderly_). My little love, I would not seem to sigh; Ever have I despised a sorry face, A gloomy or foreboding disposition. Thou hast most aptly said that I to-day Belie my character. Forgive! Forget! "
172,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virg._ (_pouting_). Forget, thou croaking raven of despair? Thou dost expect too much. I may forgive, But not forget. What ailest thee to-day? Art thou not ill or weary with thy tasks? We'll make thy labor lighter, and thy cares As to the household now shall rest on me. "
173,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Camilla._ Not so, sweet child. There is no need for that. I am not ill nor weary, nay, nor sad, But fearful and in dread of hidden woe. What may the morrow bring to thee, my babe, Or to thy father, or thy lover? What, I can not see, but only feel and dread. "
174,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virg._ Camilla! Something surely ails thee now. Oh! I am mystified and overcome By thy prophetic words, thy drear address, And I would probe thy meaning deeply, lest A vision should have warned thee of a flood Of coming tribulation. Gentle nurse, Hast visited of late the oracle? Speak! Speak to me! Speak to Virginia! Say! Tell me, nor torture me upon the rack Of fear and dread prolonged. "
175,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Camilla_ (_slowly_).       If it were aught That I might put to thee or e'en myself In syllables, I'd speak. But syllables Are clumsy things. Words are inanimate, Dull, helpless weapons, powerless unless The thoughts are present skillfully to wield The blades. Then cut and thrust they mightily, Ready to wound, or e'en with menace kill. I know not what I fear. I know not why Nor wherefore. Has the gift of second-sight Been by the gods this day on me bestowed?      [_A pause._ I seem to see great sorrow brought about By shameless wrong; I seem to see a cloud, Laden with anguish which may soon descend In burning drops on Rome, where'er I turn. Who are the victims I can not discover, But when I close mine eyes from out the black That blinds them, lo! a knife like lightning sent By Jove flashes upon me--and is gone! "
176,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virg._ (_sobbing_). Alas! My joy is fled and all is gloom. Sure 'tis some peril scowling o'er my father. Mayhap e'en now he lieth in the camp, Struck down by men who envy him his fame! Oh! horrid thought! most dread, most cruel thought! "
177,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Camilla_ (_arousing herself with effort_). Nay, weep not, my Virginia; I regret Those vague emotions which are doubtless false Deceiving dreams, sent me by Mercury, Who oft delights in filling mortal minds With gray forebodings, as thou art aware. Quick! Kiss me, child, and dry those silly tears. Lo! now methinks I hear thy father's step. "
179,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,(_Voice of Virginius without._) Little one! No welcome at the door? 
180,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"[_Virginia runs to the curtained doorway, through which her father enters, and flings her arms in tearful ecstasy around his neck._ "
182,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virg._ But smiles will clear them soon. I feared for thee-- Most foolishly, yet ne'ertheless, I feared. "
183,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virginius._ Most foolishly, indeed, my dark-haired Psyche, Thou pure-embodied soul, my spirit's light. Look up, dear child, and kiss thy father fond. He's wearied and he needs his heart's restorer. "
184,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"[_The two come forward, he in his shining armor, she nestling birdlike in the shelter of his arm._ "
187,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virginius_ (_mockingly_). ""Ah! Father!"" Ay, I saw him. Me he held Firmly, besieging me with queries, all Concerning thee. How had Virginia fared While he was absent?--the presumptious boy! Couldst thou fare otherwise than well with me? And then with eager eyes he questioned as To thy remarks, thy thoughts concerning him, Thy attitude to things in general. Where did Virginia spend her days? In school? Was she by chance affrighted at the state Of Rome since he had left her? Like unto A feverish flame, he reached on every side, Hungry for news of his Virginia. "
188,SCENE II--WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE HOUSE OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Virg._ (_dreamily_). My Love! My Love! Mine own Icilius! Oh! gentle gods, my happiness exceeds My worth. But yet, amen! So let it be.      [_Exeunt._ "
191,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius._ This is an eve of witchery, an hour Alluring, swelled with love and weighted down With dreams. "
192,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._ A time when all our best ideals Are perfected. Reality is dead, Deep-buried in her grave, and Heaven and Earth, Swayed by the wand of sweet Imagination, Languish beneath the velvet robes of Night. "
193,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius_. And 'tis a night more fair than when Dian Cast lustre on the young, unwitting face Of that deep-slumbering boy, Endymion. "
194,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._ Oh! happy boy! a goddess kissed thy hair, Mused o'er thy brows, and sighed above thy lips. "
195,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius_. Thrice happy man, who treasures human love, And humbly may accept that precious gift, A mortal maiden's heart, nor sigh for more. There is no more, nor anything so fair, As such a dear possession. Happy he, Who can, though but one instant, close and warm, Hold woman's form, or kiss the starry light Into her eyes, the blood into her cheeks! And such a man, Virginia, am I. "
196,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._ (_shyly_). Not once in life, dear Love, but many times. "
197,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius._ Not once, not twice, not thrice, but many times. "
198,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._ What might lies in the warmth of kisses given! Like wine they strengthen, quicken, stimulate, Like flame they warm, like moonlight satisfy. Like stars uplift above the common world. Dear Love, I am a weak and fearful child And need my wine, my flame, my moon and stars, To fit me for the years that lie ahead. "
202,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._ Not so. Mine ears deceived me, hearing sounds Of stealthy listeners. "
203,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius._            Virginia, Rest here upon this bed of roses. They Are ""red with anguish for Adonis' death,"" That mortal love of Venus. Dear, recline, And let thy tresses, darker than the night, In the breeze fluttering, caress my cheek, Breathing thy love for me. "
204,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._                   Icilius, 'Twas only yestereve I wandered here. The sun was casting forth his fading beams In final efforts most supreme; my thoughts Were full of peace and thee. And in the light Shed by the homing sun--the purple, red, And gold--I dreamed fair dreams, imagined visions. Methought I saw the coming years of bliss, Deepened with sorrow, lined with simple care; The sorrow of a mortal, and the care Of wife and mother. Then, at once, arose Longings that I might always worthy be, As was Eurydice of Orpheus. Never to falter, howsoe'er I feared, Turn not, stay not, fail not; a woman in My services and steadfast faith, as well As my most passionate love. My thoughts are grave; Perchance they do accord not with thy mood? "
205,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius._ Not so, thou spirit of sweet harmony, My life and soul, my one bright guiding star. Thy lover is a rude and careless man, A Roman tribune, weighted with affairs, Stern to my fellows, tender but to thee. Yet when I look on thy beloved form And perfect face, my sins are swept away, As is the unclean wrack, upon the shore, Swept by the ocean. Ay! and in its place Are left pure pearls and shells and wonders such As only dwell where man can never go-- Thy thoughts, Virginia, pure as virgin snow. "
206,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._ Last night I lay awake amid the dark, Hearing the music of the fount without My window; sharply, trebly sweet it broke The heavy, voiceless gloom of slumbering Nature and sleeping men. Awake, I dreamed Of all the bliss the gentle gods have placed Within my hold. Then, like a swelling sea, High in my bosom rose the newborn love. I thought of how it grew, so shy, so slow, At first like faltering breeze that lightly stirs And lifts the tiny feather o'er the heart Of nesting bird, then gaming courage, grows Into a gentle wind until the soul Within leaps up, and mighty, strong, and free, Soars on celestial wings above the raving sea. "
207,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"[_A silence falls, during which a light begins to break in the eastern sky._ "
208,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius._ We have outsighed the day; the rising moon Her benediction smiles upon this spot, Where breathes and hopes and loves Virginia. "
209,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._ She signals faintly, from the brightening east, To thee, my hero and my love. "
210,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius._ One kiss, One kiss in honor of fair Cynthia. May blessings come to thee with every ray From yonder orb which rises o'er the hills Of Rome and lights a glory in thy hair. Elusive soul! this moment dost thou seem A chaste, pale spirit of the lonely moon, A white Diana of nocturnal glades, Yet in the magic of the ardent sun I've seen thee flame into an Aphrodite, A glowing type of passion and desire. My love, my full and perfected ideal, My Helen and my delicate Ænone. My nymph and my incomparable queen In one. Come closer to my arms, beloved! I would not lose in any sense or thought A moment spent with thee, Virginia. "
211,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._ (_in his arms_). Closer, ay, closer, as the days go by, Deeper and deeper, stronger and more strong, Each in the other till we are not two, A man and maid, but one, but one. Oh! say How close I am to thee, Icilius? "
212,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius._ As close as vein to leaf, or leaf to stem; As close as is the rose-flush in the heart Of ocean's shell unto the shell itself; Close as the star is to its atmosphere; Wedded as day and night, no break, no void Between, but only faintest change and lights, Born of a higher world, a purer sphere, Heaven-conceived, begotten of the sky. "
213,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"[_The light visibly brightens, shining down upon the two. After a silence they stir and slowly walk apart, watching the sky. Icilius presently rejoins Virginia._ "
215,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Virg._ Nay, I could never weary in thy sight. Have I not called thy kisses and embrace My wine, my flame, my moonlight and my stars? I am not weary. But I'll come within-- The morrow brings a fresh Elysium. "
216,SCENE III--A GARDEN OVERGROWN WITH ROSES.,"_Icilius._ Oh! but the night is fair; behold each rose, How tenderly preserves and cups its dew, Barely awakened, lifting up its head And smiling at the moon. One kiss before We go within. And now, farewell, thou rose; Farewell, thou garden of nocturnal dreams And noon-day musings. Come, Virginia, Let us within. "
218,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Apartment spacious and luxurious, with hangings of various kinds. Cornelia, who is reclining in an arm chair, occupies the center of the room; a female stands behind her in the act of arranging her hair. On the left is a boy in rich patrician dress, seated beside an oblong bath, engaged in sailing a tiny fleet of vessels on the surface of the water. On the right are a number of attendants, conversing in undertones._ "
219,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ Ah, gods! I am most sad and most aweary Of this routine of state, unrestful splendor. My lovers love not me but my possessions, My friends are envious of my delights. Wretched aristocrats! Unhappy we Who call ourselves patricians, and who swear Our race is blessed of the most blessed gods! Say rather cursed, and with a heavy curse! How can I give my heart to those who are By _noble_ blood worthy and eligible, After the Roman laws, to sue for it? Eros with them is but an empty name; Passion and lust and horrible ambition Form the emotions of these ""blessed"" ones. And I, unhappy, love with pure desire Sicinius, a soldier and a pleb! Yet hath the Ten forbidden intermarriage, Just when those bars of difference were about To fall away and Heaven ope for me.       [_To the attendant._ Sufficient, Julia. "
220,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Julia._ Nay, a few light touches And thou wilt shine more fair, my lovely mistress, Than heavenly Venus in her myrtle bower. "
221,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ (_smilingly_). But I am dark as night; she as the day, Thou foolish maid. "
222,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Julia._ Believe me, thou in thy Rich, languid charm would cast enchantment o'er Adonis, as would keep him from the chase Where Venus pled in vain. "
224,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Julia_ (_slyly_). Methinks I'd make a model lover then If I do flatter. Is't not so, sweet lady? "
225,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ (_bitterly_). Lovers are mockeries in this blackened age. A maid may wed the low-souled fool so long As he's high-born! The man of noble mind Is numbered, if a common, 'mongst the dead. "
227,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ (_in displeasure_). What! Insolent! Who bade thee speak, I pray? "
228,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Julia_ (_softly_). Lady, mine eyes are clear and quick to see, And thy heart's sentinels are slumbering. I mean no insolence, by all the gods! My motive only love and sympathy. I, too, am a plebeian, and rejoice To see thy gracious, noble condescension. Yet in my joy I well could weep with pain, Seeing the darkness of thy doubtful future. "
229,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ Darkness! It is a void as empty as My heart this day is full. Begone, I pray, Each one of you; nay, thou, my Julia, stay And bid the bards perform a soothing lay. "
230,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,[_Exeunt maids. Sounds of a harp without in soft accompaniment._ 
233,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"Now kiss me, child, and talk a space with me. "
234,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Tib._ What melancholy broods upon thy brow, Curves thy dear lips, and glooms within thine eyes? "
236,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Tib._ Mayhap, for I am only twelve years old; Yet I'm no dullard, sister, and I weep Because I see thee sad. Methinks Sicinius Would weep for thee as well. "
237,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ (_starting in dismay_). Ye gods of love! Does all Italia observe my heart, Which I had deemed secure within my breast? Or possibly (although the gods forbid!) My maidens have been gossiping to thee? "
238,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Tib._ (_disdainfully_). No, never; gossip reacheth not mine ears. But oft I hear thee sigh and then, within The selfsame breath, breathe forth a name I know; A name all Romans know--Sicinius. Ay, and I oft have heard thee sob, although I fain had heard it not, since thou desirest Thy grief held secret. Sister mine, how canst Thou hope to wed a soldier and a pleb? "
239,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ Alas! Alas! Mine own Tiberius! No hope have I, and yet I love my strength Away--my heart and soul are all aflame With a wild conflagration. Boy, thou seemest Inclined to comprehend my fierce emotions, Bitter despair and strange besieging hope, That scarce is conscious hope, but mocked and crushed By the stern laws of Rome and tyranny Of the false Ten, since ever it was born. Thy bright brown eyes are luminous with soul; Wise, gentle brother, dost thou weep for me? "
240,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Tib._ (_sobbing passionately_). A curse upon those false and dreadful Ten! Cornelia, would that I might succor thee! "
241,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ Most dear, my brother, weep no more for me; The gods, who love true lovers, do despise Tyrants and murderers, and sure will aid Our cause if we be patient to the end. Time is a greybeard, and he will not haste At any whim, and Fate, a bigot stern, Who acts according to his quick desire; He preys on Innocence as well as Guilt, And none can change the fashion of his ways.      [_A pause._ Now, tell me, wast thou playing mariner, But now, and was yon bath a mighty sea? "
242,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Tib._ (_brightly_). I was Æneas, our great forefather, And I was sailing from our ancient Troy. Oft Juno dashed our ships against the rocks In spite, because the Trojans she abhorred; Yet, by a miracle, lo! I was saved. "
243,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ And didst thou then encounter and escape Scylla's dread arms, Charybdis' frightful jaws? "
244,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Tib._ Ay, and therefrom lost I three goodly men-- Two oarsmen and my helmsman. "
245,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._                  Cruel fate! Perchance thou hast survived these perils, so Thou mayst give comfort to thy troubled sister. Methinks--but what familiar sound is that? Surely his voice dismissing his attendant-- And now a knocking on the outer door! The porter cometh nigh. Tiberius, 'Tis he! I dreamed not he could come this day! "
246,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Tib._ Then I'll begone, sister; give me a kiss; I'll seek thee later and relate my voyage.      [_Exit._ "
247,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ Ah! gods! I feel as fluttered as a maid Of the plebeians might. Thus do I share The simple nature of his simple class, Through my deep love for him. My haughty mien, Patrician dignity, desert me when Mine own beloved cometh unto me. "
248,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"(_Voice of porter without._) Most gracious mistress, I await thy pleasure, To usher in a visitor to thee. "
249,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ (_aside_). I must not seem too eager, comprehensive, Lest e'en my faithful porter, noting it, Let slip without my doors some foolish scandal.      [_To porter._ Who is the visitor? "
251,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,_Cor._ Admit Sicinius into my presence.  [_Enter Sicinius and porter._ 
252,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"(_Aside._) Dear Heaven! My Love! (_Aloud._) Thou Gaius, to thy post Begone! And Julia, do thou too withdraw. "
253,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"[_Exeunt the two. A silence falls. Cornelia remains seated, a still form, most beautiful, endeavoring to calm her loving passion, one hand upon her bosom and her eyes fixed on the face of Sicinius, who stands motionless with admiration._ "
255,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Sic._ What can I say, oh, God! Thou art too fair, thou art too wondrous fair For me to break the spell. Awake! Awake! Dreamer I am not wont to be, save when Thy beauty casts a web of visions o'er me. "
256,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ My beauty paleth in the greater light, O my Sicinius, of thy manhood's worth. Awake, indeed, and greet me. I can face Thy gaze no longer; art thou turned to stone? "
257,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Sic._ (_advancing, with his arm outstretched in a sudden warmth of passion_). I turn to stone only upon the day When I can neither claim nor clasp my love. Till then mine arms continue flesh and blood, My lips as warm as thine; thou radiant Soul! (_Embracing her._) "
259,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Sic._ I do not know, for thou hast dazzled quite My goodly eyesight, and I only see Cornelia here and there and everywhere. "
260,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,_Cor._ Alas! I fear so greatly for our love; Pray Heaven thou lose me not entirely! 
261,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Sic._ Nay, rest thee, rest thee, tremble not, beloved. The life of Appius will soon be spanned, And a great wave of revolution shake Rome's center; soon I drop a mighty pebble On her dark surface, and the rings therefrom Into a rush of water thence shall widen. "
262,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ (_partly rising from her chair, her eyes alight_). The Fates be thanked that now the foul stagnation Of Rome, enslaved, is stirring into life; And _thine_ the hand! Thou'rt worthy of the cause, Thou patriot and model of a man! "
263,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Sic._ Oh! but I love my city and my race! Thank God that my stern duty lieth on The selfsame path as love for thee, my sweet. My conscience and my happiness alike Demand that I should aim to liberate Rome and the Romans from the yoke of men Who are defiling and defiled--the Ten!      [_Starts suddenly._ I came, that I might steal one glimpse of thee. The sun is high--I may not tarry more. "
265,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Sic._ Straight to the Forum--then unto the camp. The movements of our foemen, the Sabines, Are grave. Methinks I'll soon be called upon To enter into active services. Farewell, Cornelia! kiss me once again! Sweet mistress, noble lady! fare thee well!      [_Exit swiftly._ "
266,SCENE IV--HOME OF CORNELIA.,"_Cor._ Gone! Gone! So swiftly, like an eager shaft From Roman bow. Vanished, my gallant love! Where shall I see him when he doth return To me? May Mars attend and favor him, And Victory with laurel wreath adorn His earnest brows. Sicinius, farewell! "
269,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Busy passing to and fro of citizens. Enter Cornelia and Tiberius, attended by two slaves. The former appears embarrassed, fluttered, and distressed, the latter troubled and concerned._ "
270,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cor._ Gods! How the people stare upon me, brother! Alas! They reek not of a woman's heart, But judge me bold and courting their attention, I who am hungry for one gaze alone, Yet can not find. So many days have passed, No tidings from my love hath reached mine ears, And rumors that he's dead hath driven me Close unto madness. All my slaves have sought, But failed to find him. I am desperate! Surely the ears of one who loves will hear, Surely the eyes of one who loves will see, And learn his fate, whether for good or ill. He will forgive me for exposing her He loveth to the gaze of multitudes! "
271,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Tib._ Ay, but most likely he was called to serve Rome in the latest skirmish with her foes. Thy fear it is unfounded. "
272,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cor._ Nay, my child, The skirmishing they say is discontinued, And all who fought therein returned unto The camp, save only those who fell beneath The Sabine spears. My Love hath not been seen, And I can rest no longer in my house. "
273,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_While they speak, the already clouded sky darkens so rapidly that all start and look out across the populated hills. A distant peal of thunder is heard, followed by a second, greater in volume. All press together, then a cry arises:_ ""Way, make way! The sibyl of the vale would speak! She is inspired!"" _The dense crowd parts and all swing backward in confusion. A flash of lightning breaks the heavy gloom, followed by a muttering of thunder. A few large raindrops fall. The sibyl enters through the multitude, a weird, mad form, with tossing hair and wild, disheveled garments._ "
274,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Sibyl._ Wail, walls of Rome, and weep, ye tender vales Of sweet Italia! "
276,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"Oh! day of dole! Oh, day of perfect woe! Oh, Furies' day Of fever and of tears! Oh, black despair! The night of tyranny hath settled o'er Our city, roof-like shuts her from the air Of Heaven! And the hollow, brazen dome Of despotism closes o'er our heads; Black tyranny and red-hot despotism! Had I hands long enough and nails as sharp As Hate, I'd tear in shreds the infernal web! "
277,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,[_Another peal of thunder resounds. She points toward the heavy clouds._ 
278,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"My tongue is laden with the vast commands Of Jove, to-day. But Rome is deaf and mad. The gods cry out upon this tyranny, The heavens in thunder clap their wrathful hands! Yet Rome, the Rome of Romulus, the Rome Of Numa and the martial kings of old, Is deaf--is deaf and mad! Oh! woe, woe, woe! "
279,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_With a prolonged, shrill wail of despair she vanishes amid the crowd. Great agitation now displayed by the majority of citizens. Enter a runner._ "
280,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Run._ Ye men of Rome, I bear ill news with me! "
281,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,_The Cit._ What is't? Out with it! Dally not at all! 
284,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cor._ (_starting wildly forward_). Sicinius? Sicinius, the pleb? Oh! gods of Heaven! Ye have struck me hard! "
285,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_She sinks insensible upon the ground. Her slaves bend over her. Tiberius kneels beside her, sobbing bitterly._ "
287,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Run._ It is said by some that he, Being sent by the Decemvirs to select A spot most suitable whereon to camp, Fell into ambuscade and died along With several comrades. "
289,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Run._ So it hath been reported by the few That did escape.         [_He pauses, then proceeds._ But hearken, citizens! The bodies lay unspoil'd, with faces turned All toward one--that one, Sicinius. The Ten hath hated and hath feared this man! No more. Construe the meaning as ye list; I must away. "
290,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_Exit runner. The four citizens, Horatius, Galba, Marius, and Hortensius, approach the prone form of Cornelia._ "
291,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Hor._ A lady of patrician birth! Good slaves, Can we assist thy mistress, who appears In such a piteous and hapless plight? "
292,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Slave_ (_sobbing_). Alas! Alas! I know not what to do, Or what hath come upon her suddenly. Ah! see, she stirs! Lady, awake! awake! "
293,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cor._ (_opening her eyes, but making no attempt to raise herself_). Those words he used when last he came to me. Oh! bitter, bitter fate! Say not awake, But sleep eternally! Sicinius! "
294,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,_Galba._ It doth appear affection did exist Betwixt Rome's great plebeian and this lady. 
295,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Tib._ Ay, sir, she loved him e'en as he loved her; But naught was said because they feared the Ten. Nay, I was wrong! Sicinius and fear Are alien the one unto the other! But rather did he bide his time until These men should be o'erthrown and Rome be freed From their most hateful laws and government. "
296,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,_One of the multitude._ Hark to the boy! He is a demagogue. 
297,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Another._ Nay, he is innocent, and therefore bold. Parroting sentiments that are not his own. "
298,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_A third._ And yet he speaks the truth, the naked truth. See how this woman hath been sadly wronged, And how her life is marred by these Decemvirs; For surely they gave orders for the death Of him who was a leader and a man! Have they not feared him for these many months, Because his tongue is sharper than a sword? And these two, a patrician and a pleb, Each representing classes now united By common misery, are foully hurt, And scarred by fierce injustice from the Ten. Vengeance! The time is ripe for vengeance. Rome Can bear no more. Sicinius is dead! "
301,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_Enter Virginia, followed by Camilla. She espies Cornelia and at once approaches._ "
304,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"Oh, tearful sight! Ah me, most sorrowful! Thou art Cornelia, whom I oft have seen, Of whom I've heard from thy dear lover's lips. I knew him well; he waits for thee beyond The sea, in the broad Islands of the Blest, Where heroes find a haven and a rest. "
305,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_She smooths the other's brow in silence for a space, and then proceeds._ "
306,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"Look up, poor broken spirit, and discern A friendly face and weep upon my heart. She will not rouse herself! Good people, pray, Press not upon her. Bring a car, O slave, The lady is unable to return On foot. The carriage waits without the place? 'Tis well. And now to bring her to herself! Cornelia, waken! But look not so cold. Thou gentle heart! relieve the strain of grief With tears of passion. Then come home, come home. "
307,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cor._ (_rousing herself_). Tell me, who art thou, O thou noble maid? "
309,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cor._ Canst thou not take me from this staring crowd? Their eyes are knives; the very air is poison. Oh, God! He is not dead? "
310,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Virg._ (_assisting her to her feet_). Come home, sweet sister. "
312,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Virg._ Art thou Tiberius, thou tender child? Weep not; assist me with thy stricken sister. "
313,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_As the three, the slaves in close attendance, are about to make their way through the multitude, there comes a sudden disturbance, and Marcus Claudius springs forward._ "
314,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ Ho! stay a bit, my servant; stay with me! "
315,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_He seizes rude hold on Virginia, who shrieks aloud in terror. At once the four citizens make their way to her side._ "
317,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Virg._ Aid me, in Heaven's name, ye citizens! Deliver me from shame! Icilius! Icilius, my love, where art thou now? "
318,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ (_in undertone_). Thy struggles, maid, succeed in binding thee But closer in mine arms. Hast thou a lover? He hears thee not, and thou art my possession. Now, still thyself. Gods! Proserpine, thou art As strong as is Cybele's lioness! "
320,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Hor._ Beast! I will kill thee, maim thee like a dog, Unless thou takest thy hand from off the maid! "
321,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ (_panting_). Reserve thy threats and play thou warily, Justice upholds me! "
323,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ (_coolly_).     Shout less loud, Look not aghast, my masters. I will take This girl by law--she is my rightful slave. "
325,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ Soft, friend, be calm, hold off, I pray! Hark! she was born a slave within my house, And thence was stolen and declared to be The offspring of the man Virginius, Whose wife had borne an infant at the time, Which on the moment of its birth had died. Virginius himself was then away, And on returning deemed it was his babe, And deems so to this day. I waited long, And now have found in this Virginia My property. A woman hath confessed; The one who stole her thence and fled away, Returning but to die within the house Of Appius, my patron, whom I serve. "
326,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cam._ Oh, liar! I first clasped her in mine arms When she was born! Remove thine impious hand! In childhood and in girlhood I have watched Her growth, and guarded her from shame or harm. "
327,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Multitude._ Ay, ay! She speaks the truth! Loose thou the maid! She is no slave. We know Virginius. "
328,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ Now, I'll have justice, though it cost me e'en My life, itself. "
330,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_He strikes him boldly with, clenched fist. The client staggers, losing his hold on Virginia, who takes refuge with the three citizens._ "
332,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Galba_ (_ironically_). Ay, e'en thy word Weighs naught with us free citizens of Rome. "
333,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ (_hissing between his teeth_). My word _shall_ weigh with you, ye coward curs! For lo! My word is--Appius! Ah--so! "
334,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_The mob shrinks backward at the name, and Marcus laughs in scorn._ "
335,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"(_Vindictively._) I see it hath a little weight with you? ""Free citizens of Rome!"" Ye make me laugh. Oh! ay, I know ye'd mob me joyously, Stone me, or cast me from Tarpeian Rock, Save that--save that--ye _dare_ not! Appius Would leave not one small particle of this, His client, unavenged. Back, all of you! The maid is mine! Ye can not say me nay. "
336,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_One of the multitude._ But if we threaten thee, or bear her off, And save her from thy most illegal movements, What then? "
337,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,_Marc._   What then? To Appius Claudius For justice I would go! 
339,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,(_With mocking smile_). Lo! now he comes Within the Forum. 
340,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,[_Even as he speaks the Chief of the Decemvirs enters. He is seated in a chair which is borne by four slaves._ 
341,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Appius_ (_frowning sombrely_). What bodes this tumult? Who, yon lovely girl? "
343,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Appius._ Silence! and let me hear one voice alone. Marcus, my client, speak, for I would have An explanation of this strange disturbance. "
344,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ Most noble Appius, I owned this girl, Born in my house full sixteen years ago, Of my slave-woman. "
345,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cam._ (_boldly_).   Liar! All men know Her mother was free-born and wedded to Virginius, centurion and pleb. "
346,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Appius._ Gag yonder hag, or drag her hence--I'll have No withered woman's voice of spite exclaiming. "
347,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cam._ Thy lictor shall not lay his hands upon me! My place is here. My voice shall speak for her, Nor fear thee, king of tyrants and despoilers! Long have I inwardly foreseen this day, And prayed the gods to change the hand of Fate. It seems my prayers are valueless. But still, Still there does yet remain to me--my _curse_! And all shall feel its potency who dare To lay a finger on Virginia. "
348,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,[_She faces Marcus Claudius with her arm extended and her manner menacing._ 
349,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"Thou, fool of fools, who ventured to pollute The purest virgin breathing in this land, Because thou placed thy hand upon her flesh, Which is as perfect as her perfect soul, I curse thee--ay, and with a heavy curse, For that which thou hast done! Thy misery Shall soon exceed even thy trespasses, Which in themselves are countless as the stars. Be cursed, and live accursed and die accursed! And be my witnesses, O, all ye gods! "
351,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"And as for thee--I fear thee not. My curse Shall rest on thee according to thine actions. This much I have to say--thy tyranny And rule of blood is waning to its close. Beware, nor haste thy doom before its time. "
352,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ (_trembling_). Seize on her, some of you, for she is mad. "
353,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_One of the multitude._ Nay, she is gifted with strange prophecy. She voices Jove. "
354,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,[_A tumult now arises in the background. Icilius springs forward with a cry._ 
356,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_He faces Marcus Claudius, and with one blow strikes him down, then clasps Virginia in his arms._ "
360,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"Now, as a free-born Roman, I demand An explanation and a satisfaction! "
362,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"Silence, thou hound, ere I forget myself And murder thee! Thine answer, Appius? "
364,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Icilius._ Thou canst not, lictor! In common manhood and as her betrothed, Thus do I hold to her against the world. "
366,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Virginia._ Now, intervene, ye gods! Icilius, my love! Oh! men of Rome, Have ye indeed forgot Lucretia? "
367,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,[_Swaying of the multitude. Appius Claudius rises in his car._ 
368,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Appius._ Be prudent, ye who do desire to see Full justice. We must hark to every plea, And will to-morrow judge the case. Till then, Thou, Marcus, guard the maiden, since the man Virginius is absent from the town. "
369,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_A hissing protest from the multitude and a cry from Virginia follows this announcement. Icilius faces the Chief Decemvir with blazing eyes, and draws Virginia closer._ "
370,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Icilius._ Over my body only shall yon hound Of Hell seize on her. I am yet a man With strength to shield or life to sacrifice For that which is mine own. Sleep 'neath his roof? I'd sooner see her cold upon her bier, Or bound upon the wheel of Ixion, Enduring tortures of the damned themselves! With him? I'd rather cast her to a wolf, Who, merciful, would tear her into shreds And leave her pure, or o'er Tarpeia's Rock, And with mine eyes behold her perfect form Shattered upon the kindly stones below, Ere Marcus Claudius lay hands on her. "
371,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Marius._ Ay, he is right; the maiden yet is free. The charge hath not been proven, Appius! "
372,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Appius._ So be it. We will acquiesce thus far, But lictors must be stationed as a guard About the house wherein she spends the night, Lest she escape and law be unfulfilled. "
373,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cor._ (_coming forward_). I will go thither and attend this night Upon her. Thou, Tiberius, return Home with the slaves. To-morrow meet me here. "
374,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Slave._ Lady, thy lips are white and thou art ill. See, thou dost tremble. "
375,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Cor._ Woman, what of that? How canst thou weigh my pallor with her pain-- The anguish in her eyes? What though I shake As with an ague? She herself is turned To stone with horror deeper than mine own. A living sorrow doth exceed a dead; Death to dishonor seemeth merciful. _Her_ blow is heavy with the weight of dread, _Mine_ light with hope. Did she not succor me? How can I fail her in her time of need? "
376,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Appius._ Lictors, take into custody yon man. Lest he do mischief. "
377,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"_Icilius._ By the almighty gods! Unhand me! I will kill thee, as a man Would kill a beast. Ah! foulest trick to seize Upon me from the rear. Oh, God! Oh, God! "
378,SCENE I--A CLOUDY MORNING IN THE FORUM.,"[_He sinks helpless upon the stones at Virginia's feet, two lictors binding him firmly with cords. The storm now breaks, shrieking in maddest fury, the lightning playing over the hills of Rome._ "
380,SCENE II--A CHAMBER IN THE HOME OF VIRGINIUS.,"_Midnight and darkness, save where the moonlight shimmers through the columns on the left. Virginia is discovered kneeling in the sea of radiance as though in prayer. A silence follows the rise of the curtain; then, low at first, but louder, clearer, gradually increasing in volume, a hymn breaks from her lips, she kneeling still._ "
382,HYMN TO DIANA.,"O, thou virgin-goddess fair, Look upon me in my sorrow; Hear, oh, hear mine earnest prayer! Guard me from the fatal morrow! Purity is in thy breast With thy silver moonbeams drest. "
383,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Still my cheek is hot with shame, And my heart in anguish crying; Let me keep my spotless name, Waking, sleeping, living, dying! Chaste Dian, thy stainless glory Still resounds in song and story. "
384,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Mount thy ear within the blue, Waft a whisper to me only! Thou a heart hast, strong and true, Think upon the maiden lonely. Without thee it now would seem Love were nothing but a dream. "
385,HYMN TO DIANA.,[_Cornelia suddenly appears from out the gloom behind and puts her arms about Virginia's neck._ 
386,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Cor._ Love but a dream? Ah, no! The gods forfend! "
388,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Cor._ No other than this broken heart; Yet is my soul untouched by human woe, As thine shall be untouched by human sin. "
389,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia._ I see the face, with passion fiery, The full voluptuous lips and greedy eyes, I see and shudder. "
393,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia._ None saw as I saw! He alone I fear, Who on the morrow will decide, dear God!-- For Marcus--yet not Marcus--but himself; Allot _me_ as his own. (_Wildly._) I saw his look, And felt his power! Marcus is the paw Wherewith great Appius will seize his prey. (_Laughs._) Virginia, his prey! He leered on me, And in the whitening of his clenchéd hand I marked the clash and clangor of his soul. Dear gods! The feet of Night are leaden shod, And yet the precious moments speed too fast. Oh, Death! had I the courage that thou dost Demand, I'd summon thee. Methinks I hear E'en now the distant rustle of thy wings. And yet--thou tarriest--thou tarriest. "
394,HYMN TO DIANA.,_Cor._ Would Death might choose me out as willing prey! 
395,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia._ Dear one, thy voice is weary like the world, Which is so old and heavy with its years; And yet thine eyes are bright, undimmed by tears. "
396,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Cor._ Bright with the pain that kills by slow degrees. Ah! for Apollo's pestilential dart, Or but to see the shears of Atropos Flash in Diana's beams. "
397,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia_ (_softly_). We loved her light, Thou--thou and I, when love was all in life, And those, our own, the twain, Icilius And brave Sicinius--""Ah, God! Ah, God!"" Thus cried he, my beloved, as he sank Prone at my feet, a tyrant's prisoner. "
398,HYMN TO DIANA.,[_Breaks from Cornelia's grasp and glides in anguish to the curtained doorway on the right._ 
401,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Lictor._ Lady, I must exhort thee to be prudent; Such cries will but confine thee e'en more strait Than thou art now confined. Silence is best. So ordered Appius, our gracious lord.      [_Exit lictor._ "
402,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia_ (_sobbing softly_). I will be still! But I am so afraid, I, innocent, know nothing of the world. Life-bondage? Nay, methinks I am but mad. Severed from _him_! Ah! lay me in my grave, Rather than have my heart torn from my breast. "
404,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Oh! If to pass in moonbeams from this life Mid the pure notes of music stealing on Into my brain and sinking in my breast, Enveloping my soul; or to the sound Of rushing wind--that music of the gods Swept by Apollo's hand, or harking to The distant murmur of the restless sea, Striking its pearly harp of mystic sounds, Echoed within the caves where maidens dwell, Nereides and Oceanides, With faces like the sheen of moonbeams, forms Like the white foam their sire, Neptune, makes When angered, with his trident! If to sleep, Sleeping, to dream, and dreaming, live again The years that now lie white upon their bier. "
406,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Ah, me! I am so utterly alone! The moon hath veiled herself, the silence drear Knocks on my heart, unhidden enters in, Where once love and sweet innocence, in peace Dwelt, all unscarred by a despoiler's hand. It is grown cold! What was that sound I heard? I am so sunk in solitude, so wrapped In vacant space, so chilled, I gasp for breath, Like drowning mariner; but for a hand Warm, loving, to uplift me from this death Among the living, life among the dead! "
407,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Cor._ Virginia! Weep or pray, but do not so! Alas, Virginia, art thou turned to stone? "
408,HYMN TO DIANA.,"[_Virginia, all unhearing, turns once more toward the columns where the moon again shines through._ "
409,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia_ (_singing_). ""In the deep dream-light thy bark thou art guiding, Shifting thy garments, the clouds, as a sail. Rocked o'er celestial waves thou art riding, Hiding thy features behind a light veil. "
410,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Dian, the spell of thy muteness cast o'er me. Calm the wild tumult which wars in my brain, E'er through my life may thine image, before me. Shining and constant as ever remain."" "
411,HYMN TO DIANA.,"[_A silence falls. Virginia steals up to Cornelia, who stands weeping alone._ "
412,HYMN TO DIANA.,"My comfort hath not been denied me--see, The moonbeams bear the message from the sky. I hear a song which issues from the stars, A song of love and hope for a reunion; Re-born, we, who have loved and lost, shall live Afar from sin amid the Blessed Isles, And walk together, soul with soul, and heart With heart; no drop of passionate blood shall be Lost in our death, but we shall throb with love, And laugh amid the light of suns to be. "
413,HYMN TO DIANA.,[_A pause. Softly a dim gray light steals through the columns; the moon is sinking slowly. Cornelia turns in sudden terror._ 
414,HYMN TO DIANA.,"Farewell, immortal friend, go to thy rest; Thy kindly watch is o'er. "
415,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Cor._ Virginia, see! Now dawns the cruel day when thou--when thou-- Ye gods have mercy on us twain this day! "
417,HYMN TO DIANA.,_Virginia_ (_pointing to the east_). It steals with faltering steps and blushing cheeks. Call it not cruel; it has wept for me. The dew is heavy. 
418,HYMN TO DIANA.,"(_Voice of lictor without._) See, it is the dawn. Look, comrades! "
419,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia_ (_starting as from out a dream_). Ah, Cornelia! Sure, I sleep. Is this my father's house? This four-walled cell, This prison, and am I Virginia? Could it have been but yesterday I woke Within this chamber from a happy dream. I dreamed of _him_, my love, Icilius, And woke still with his kiss upon my lips. I can recall the flood of morning light, A billowed sea of light upon the wall. I watched the changing pools and shifting waves, And smiled; the music of the fount without, In rising cadence, played within mine ears, And presently the stirring of the maids And hum of spinning reached me and I rose, Glad, with the day. And now--Cornelia, touch My cheek lest I be vanishing to air; Feel if my heart yet beats. Methinks I'm dead; Even this moment but a roving ghost. "
420,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Cor._ Courage, Virginia. Why, much hope is left! To-day thy father will return, and he Would place his soul in jeopardy for thee. "
421,HYMN TO DIANA.,"_Virginia._ Courage, ay, courage! I am brave again. It is the dawn. Cornelia, we will seek The outer court and wash our tears away In the cool fountain. Once again my cheek Is hot with spirit and my heart beats swift With hope and newborn trust in those I love. "
422,HYMN TO DIANA.,"[_Exeunt the two, their arms wound round each other and Cornelia's lips pressed to Virginia's cheek._ "
424,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_A multitude has gathered. Appius is in the judgment seat, with Marcus Claudius stationed beside him. Many women are weeping and the men appear silent and angry. Appius is surrounded by a guard of lictors. Cornelia and Tiberius are seated on the left in a car drawn by slaves. Near the center are gathered Galba, Hortensius, Horatius, and Marius._ "
425,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Marius._ This vast suspense weighs on me heavily; I would not see that gentle maiden wronged For all my world possessions! E'en the gods Would shriek with horror if yon slave of Dis, Young Marcus Claudius, should seize on her. Why doth she not appear? "
426,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Hort._ She and her father, Who hath returned, hot-foot, from camp to her, Tarry about the town, and every man They meet they do address with exhortations And prayers for justice and for witnesses, That this gross tale which men do know is false Shall be so proven. Yet all Rome is prone Beneath the foot of Appius and his nine Vile colleagues. Fear is most tyrannical, Justice is dying, Mercy now is dead. "
428,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Hor._ (_hotly_). Nay, shall she be defiled and made a slave? Not while my hands are free, my body quick With lifeblood, and my heart a man's. Why she Is pure and frail as is the mountain snow. Happy the man who stands her champion. Happy Icilius, our young tribune! "
429,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"[_Enter Virginius in mean, plebeian garments and Virginia simply clothed in white, her dark hair loose. A murmur of sympathy and admiration greet their appearance, quickly suppressed. Enter from the other side Icilius, vainly struggling in the hands of armored soldiers. His hair is wild and greatly disheveled, his features white and drawn with agony._ "
432,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"[_He stretches out his bound arms toward her, and in a moment with a cry she runs to him, regardless of the gazing world, and kneeling at his feet kisses with fervor the hands in bondage for her sake. Murmurs from the multitude._ "
433,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Appius_ (_rising to his feet, his face aflame_). Back, girl! Back from him! Lictor, part the twain! "
434,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"[_Lictor unwillingly obeys, whereat Virginia rising slips away from him to her father's side. Virginius advances, with his hand uplifted, toward the judgment seat._ "
435,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Virginius._ Delay no longer in the trial of This matter. We demand in common justice A hearing, and at once, O, Appius! "
436,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Galba_ (_aside to his friends_). Mark yonder man upon the judgment-seat. Methinks 'tis he who coveteth the virgin, And Marcus but his instrument. Ah, see! The Chief is moved to acquiesce. Methinks He fears this pleb as he once feared Sicinius. "
437,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Appius_ (_haughtily_). And now begins the judgment. Silence, all! My client, Marcus Claudius, step forth. "
438,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"[_The man obeys. Virginia, shuddering, looks only at her father._ "
440,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ O, noble Chief, and all ye men of Rome, I but reiterate my words to-day Spoken in explanation of my course Of action yesternoon. A woman came Unto the house of Appius, one moon Ago, and came to perish on our hands. But ere she died she made a full confession Of having served in early years the wife Of this our citizen, Virginius, Who ignorantly hath been foully wronged, For whom we feel the deepest sympathy, And unto whom I now address myself. "
442,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"O, good centurion, this maid is not Thy child in blood; but, as I said, was born Of a slave woman in my house. Thy babe Died on the moment of its birth. Thou wert Away in service. Dost thou not recall? "
443,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Virginius_ (_in calm affirmative_). Yea, that I do recall. (_Aside._) Thou fiend of hell! "
444,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Marc._ (_triumphantly_). Has he not said? This slave, who did confess To us the truth, declared that she had played The thief and crept most slyly to my house, Stolen the infant of my nurse and slipped Out, 'mid the night and gloom, which, friendly, hid Her dastard deed. Virginia is the babe, And, therefore, lawfully belongs to me. "
449,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Appius._ Silence! Virginius, speak, and be as brief As the occasion will allow. Proceed. "
450,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Virginius._ Ye men of Rome! To you, and you alone, I speak in my defense, for lo! in you I see the qualities of common justice, Or faintest sense of mercy, which is rare-- And less, indeed, unto the point in hand. For all these forty years I've lived in Rome, A Roman 'mongst the Romans, brave amongst The brave, and serving, ere I came of age, My mother city. Have I shown myself In any manner base, corruptible, Or lying, either by my word or deed? Ye all are witnesses of me--each man Can see and know the truth as God can see. This is my babe, of me begotten, born Of her whom I so loved--her mother. Lo! The very luster of her ebon hair Bespeaks the woman who in honor bore Virginia. See! The tremble of her lip. I do not willingly display my flesh And blood to gaze of multitudes, but that My straits are desperate. Look upon her hand-- The long, brown fingers are a copy true Of these, though mine are knotted by the grip Of sword and the guiding of the plow. And now her eyes--Ah, no! I say too much. Ye gods of Heaven speak for me this day! "
452,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Appius._ He faints with sudden revelation from The gods of what is manifestly true. Virginius, thou art deluded, or A man, of old, deceptive. "
453,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Virginia._ 'Tis a lie! He is Virginius, no more, no less! And 'tis enough, as Rome can witness to. Thou art not worthy to crawl on the ground And kiss the hand which hath these many years Battled for Rome! Thou canst but harm our flesh. His name and mine are unstained as the flame On Vesta's altar. "
454,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,[_Turns to where Icilius is struggling vainly in the hands of the guard._ 
455,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"Peace, Icilius! Of what avail is aught to such as these? Small hope is left--and yet, O, Appius, Wert thou not born of woman? For the one Who gave thee life, respect her sisters now. Let mercy dawn within thy hardened breast, Speak but one word--one word--and many lives Will leap and live again. Look down upon And honor this grey head, now bowed so low; The only stay and comfort in his age Wouldst tear from him? His years in solitude Will roll away, a never-ending tide. Ye Romans, look upon your citizens, Protect your women--lest indignant Jove Lightnings shall send upon you, or the shield Of Mars be taken from its sanctuary. "
456,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"[_Icilius at this moment breaks from the grasp of the soldiers and leaps to Virginia's side. The girl lifts his bound hands and places them against her breast, raising her eyes to his._ "
457,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"Icilius! I heard a ringing laugh, And saw, as in a vision, a young child-- Our flesh and blood--our souls' inheritor. I saw adorning me, in the strange dream, A wedding garland fresh, not clanging chains. O, if to die within thine arms! But stay! My father--see the workings of his face! He suffers. Father, we shall meet again In the Elysian fields, when I am free! "
458,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Appius._ Fools! Cease your maudlin tragedy! Disperse! Come forward, slave, the judgment hath been passed. "
460,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Tiberius_ (_leaping from the car_). It is not so! Virginia, stay awhile! "
462,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Virginia._ The knot is hard and I am dazed. I tremble. Love, wilt thou sacrifice thy life for me? "
463,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,_Icilius._ Ah! some one loose me of these cursed bonds! 
464,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"[_He is seized by the soldiers and again forced from the young girl's side. Cornelia steps from her car, and coming forward kneels at the feet of Appius._ "
465,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Cor._ Lord Appius, behold a broken heart, But one with gentle blood from noble veins Forever fed. Though proud, I kneel to thee. O, loose her bonds--restore her liberty-- And I my wealth, my house, and e'en my life Shall give to thee or this thy servant here. Deep down into the dust I do incline Myself, who am a lady of the best And noblest line in Rome. I offer thee My services, if thou wilt free the maid Who did befriend me in mine hour of need. "
466,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Virginia._ Cornelia! To me! Nay, it shall not be! Thou friend of friends, such sacrifice is vain. One kiss alone I ask of thee--one kiss-- Then silence! See, Tiberius weeps for thee. "
467,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,[_Tiberius springs with a cry into Cornelia's arms. The two draw off together. The four citizens come forward._ 
468,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Galba._ O, Appius, we offer thee our lives To do with as thou wilt--but loose the maid! "
469,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Appius._Petitioners, ye gods, from every side? It shall not be, for she is Marcus' slave. The judgment has been passed, and I have spoken! "
473,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"Make way, ye fools! I'll call my colleagues here With all their lictors. There will be bloodshed! Make way! "
474,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Icilius._ Ah! but to have my hands about His throat, though for a moment, for a breath; Though for a heart-beat and, beyond me, Hell! "
476,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Virginius._ Quiet, little girl! O, Appius, the final shred of hope, The weakened flame, is gone--forever gone. Before we part, indeed, one moment grant To us aside, that I may speak with her. "
477,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Appius._ Haste, then, old pleb! Nor tarry long for tears. "
478,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Virginius._ Tears? What are they? My heart is dead and barren, My soul athirst for death. Tears mean no more To me than rain upon a broken stone. "
479,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,[_He leads the girl aside. All watch in breathless silence._ 
480,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_Virginia._ O, Heavenly Powers above, deliver me, By whirlwind or by sword, from this dread place! Father, farewell!      [_Presses his hand to her lips._ "
484,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"[_He plunges it into her bosom and she falls back into the arms of Icilius, who has freed himself and leaps to her side with a cry. Tumult and swaying of the crowd._ "
485,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"(_Brandishing knife._) With this blood, Appius! thy life and thee Devote I to perdition! "
486,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"[_Makes his way with the knife through the multitude. Icilius lays her body down, murmuring,_ ""Virginia, by thy blood shall Rome be free!""       [_Exit._ "
491,SCENE III--THE FORUM.,"_It rises again to show the collected army, with Virginius and Icilius at the head. Appius is about to leave the seat, his cloak around his head. Several lictors have fallen to the ground. Camilla still kneels beside the body, gazing vacantly before her. Virginia's dark hair falls like a shroud around her._ "
495,STEWARDSHIP.,"What can I do for Thee, Almighty God, Whose breath can wake, whose voice can calm, the sea? Should I endeavor, with this striving brain, Which, in its striving, errs, and, erring, turns, And, fearful, flies from its appointed field-- With these weak hands, that blindly grope along The road of Truth to higher things, uplift Those fallen by the way, whom Thou didst name My brothers? I, to the sad, ancient world, Speak, in unfaltering accents, of my soul's Instinctive yearnings, loftiest ideals, And holiest hopes of the fair destiny Of all my fellow-souls, who tread the way? When One has left a message, sweet, divine, Eternal, for the fainting world to read, Should I arise and cry, an echo faint, Of His all-satisfying tones of Love, And lisp my dreams of Truth? I am afraid! Yet, trembling, still I dare not to be mute. Remembering His vast Love, I can not choose But humbly say the lessons I have learned. Teach me, O God, to feel Thy silences, And hear Thy voice aright, in wind and wave; Teach me the upward look of Faith and Hope, Which lifts, nor ever drags the spirit down; Teach me the tender touch and the warm smile Of a deep, all-embracing heart, whose light Is the sweet essence of true Charity! "
497,THE SEA GULL.,"Strong-winged soul of the lifting sea, Bird of the gale, Launch thyself from the crags, and fly Over the crested waves, nor sigh For the sheltered home, but gladly hail The sea and the open sky! "
498,THE SEA GULL.,"High, low, high, low, Over the foam, Gliding level with the mast, Darting close above the vast Roll of billows--then come home, And hide thee from the blast. "
499,THE SEA GULL.,"Once again, thy pinions free Spread to the speaking breeze! Forward, like a mermaid light, Onward, like to a soul as white As the curling foam of the singing seas, Nor shrink from the coming night. "
500,THE SEA GULL.,"Rolling fog and fading light, Spread and sail! Fold thy pinions, breast the deep, In the darkness, Spirit, sleep, Soul of the gale! "
502,MT. VERNON.,"Home of the Dead! One glance of lingering love We cast behind us, where our vessel's wake Winds, foaming, backward to Virginian hills. Home of the Dead! Retreating from thy shores We breathe a final sigh, a last farewell. The pillared mansion gleams amid the green, The sombre tomb, deserted, stands alone; While, over all, a thousand beacons burn. The West displays a canopy of sky, Woven by angels, flung across the hills, Where sleeps the silent dust of Washington. "
503,MT. VERNON.,"Bleak is the wind that leaps like blade unsheathed From out the silver scabbard of the East! At hide and seek, among the ruffled waves, The eerie shadows play in elvish glee. A thief, Night steals the golden glories bright Of Day. But still a flush of silken rose Colors the West, stains the broad river's breast, And casts a garland 'cross the Eastern sky. "
504,MT. VERNON.,"Behold, on either shore, reflected green, Dim in the dying lustre of the sun, While tips of rose, like diadems, adorn And wreathe the gracious brows of drowsy hills. Behold and marvel! See and comprehend! Amid this beauty lies the sacred dust Of one who was a hero and a man, While all the hills that sleep about his tomb Shine with the glory of God's holy light. "
506,MY MOTHER.,"Has she faded from my skies forevermore, Like a star that slides adown the arch of Night, Or the sunlight, swiftly paling on the shore Of my boundless sea of hopes, that glittered bright In the lustre of her smile? Is she gone forevermore? Or has she but departed for a while? "
507,MY MOTHER.,"Shall I never feel her hand upon my brow? Shall I never meet her lips in kisses sweet? Or is it that I am denied her now, And some day shall hear the music of her feet, And, like Proserpine, will come, with the happy winds that blow, Leap the years, and find, in her, my final home? "
509,THE CRADLE SONG.,"Adown the vista of the years, I turn and look with silent soul, As though to catch a muted strain Of melody, that seems to roll In tender cadence to my ear. But, as I wait with eyes that long The singer to behold--it fades, And silence ends the Cradle Song. "
510,THE CRADLE SONG.,"But when the shadows of the years Have lengthened slowly to the West, And once again I lay me down To sleep, upon my mother's breast, Then well I know I ne'er again Shall cry to God, ""How long? How long?"" For, to my soul, her voice will sing A never-ending Cradle Song. "
512,OUT OF THE DARK.,"Out of the Dark that shrouded Thee, my Lord, Upon that day of Passion and of Pain, There rose a cry from Thee which rent the sky, Piercing the shadows of the noontide gloom In vibrant tones that rang with agony Supreme, and, with the strength of holy grief, Divine despair, rolled upward on the wings Of Mystery unto the eternal Throne-- ""Eli! Eli! Lama Sabacthani!"" "
513,OUT OF THE DARK.,"Out of the dark that lies about my soul, Upon this day of sorrow and of pain, I lift mine eyes and gaze with prayerful heart Upon the tortured image of my Lord, Then lo! the sombre shadows melt away, And round my spirit glows a wonderous light, By thine own Cross and Passion, blessed Lord, And by that mystic moment of despair, Thy world shall never know Thine awful Woe, Nor cry to God in agony supreme-- ""Eli! Eli! Lama Sabacthani!"" "
515,NIOBE.,"(Dedicated to the statue of Niobe, in the Uffizi Palace, Florence, Italy.) "
516,NIOBE.,"Oh! form of perfect woe, in grief unending! Soul-anguish, mortal pangs, in marble moulded! Oh, sobs! by us unheard, that bosom rending! Oh, tender form! within those arms enfolded! "
517,NIOBE.,"With heart undaunted, has the Mother striven Against Death's vengeance, e'en within its portal; And when her soul with horror most is riven, Woman, she dares to face the wrath immortal. "
518,NIOBE.,"So, through the ages, see those forms united In an eternal clasp. Ah, woe transcendent! Upon that face, its beauty all unblighted, We read the Mother-love, supreme, resplendent! "
520,"TO THE GENIUS OF DEATH, BY CANOVA.","Genius of Death! Thou form as white and slim As moonbeams, falling through the awful dome Above thee when the deathlike night draws down; Speak, through those sweet, still lips, whose solemn curve Alone gives token of thine ancient, dread Supremacy! Say that thou art not Death, But holy Calm or silent hushed Repose. Still are thy stern lips dumb, no hopeful breath Exhaling! Then, from them, do I appeal To something more divine. O'er that calm brow And carven face, uplifted from the tomb In speechless faith, there shines a wondrous light That mocks the awful declaration there. Genius of Death thou canst not be, for lo! Thou art the Soul of Immortality! "
522,TO THE WINGED VICTORY OF SAMOTHRACE.,"""Winged Victory?"" Unworthy is that name, Thou marble miracle of endless Time! I see thee standing yonder in the light, Upon thy rude and lonely pedestal, A shape as strange as it is beautiful. To me, thou art a wingéd mystery, For where, in all the ages of the past, Years of the present, centuries to come, Can there be found creation like to thee, Conceived by God or Man? A miracle; Marble in motion--yet divinely still, As though it paused to hear its own low breath-- Yet breathes not; pacing on its lonely height-- Yet stirs not; heavenly wings outspread, with chaste Angelic curve--yet not in flight extended. Thou art not of the living nor the dead. Thy wings do breathe of immortality, Of Heavenly Presence, yet thy headless form, In all its marred and mutilated grace, Points to the clay. How can we solve thee, then? Enigma so profound was never known Among the many countless works of Man. Thou art incarnate Mystery itself, Brooding above the world; the Universe Lies in the shadow of thine outspread wings-- Thou silent Spirit of the Infinite! "
524,BEATRICE TRIUMPHANT.,"(To Beatrice Cenci, as she is depicted in Guido Reni's painting of St. Michael and the Dragon.) "
525,BEATRICE TRIUMPHANT.,"Gold hair, blown back from radiant brow, Crowning, like light, a maiden, martyred head, Feet planted on the ""Dragon,"" prone, And mighty wings in victory outspread. In thee what change, divinely wrought! What wondrous resurrection from the dead! "
526,BEATRICE TRIUMPHANT.,"He lies, beneath thy righteous feet, Who, cruel craven, caused thee to be slain; He writhes who let thee agonize, A captive and in undeservéd pain, And crawls, in sight of all the world, Forever rendered loathsome by that stain! "
527,BEATRICE TRIUMPHANT.,"And thou, bright dream of brooding light, With woman's face and angel's stature, thou Exquisite seraph, fresh from God, Tell me, why wakes no awful vengeance now On thy grave lips? Oh! Woman, wronged, Unfold the mystery of that calm brow! "
529,THE CALL OF THE IRISH SEA.,"Gray Irish Sea, wild Irish Sea, That spreads so free, gray Irish Sea-- Your freedom mocks the shores you beat With the booming tread of your angry feet; The Celtic heart no longer sings To the rhythmic rush of Freedom's wings! Wild Irish Sea, gray Irish Sea, Chant Freedom's dirge, wild Irish Sea! "
530,THE CALL OF THE IRISH SEA.,"Gray Irish Sea, wild Irish Sea, You call to me, gray Irish Sea, I hear the harp-strings of the North, And stirring bagpipes thrilling forth; I dream the dreams of olden days, I hear bold Ossian chant his lays! Wild Irish Sea, gray Irish Sea, You call to me, wild Irish Sea! "
532,THE LION OF LUCERNE.,"Hid in a hushed retreat, a lovely dell, Where Mother Nature sings low lullabies, And weaves her silence like a sacred spell, Beneath the light of deep and tender skies, In his lone agony the Lion lies. "
533,THE LION OF LUCERNE.,"Colossal creature of a sculptor's brain, Are you the marble that you seem to be? Inanimate, untouched by mortal pain? Within that form, and yearning to be free, Your soul must wrestle with Death's mystery! "
534,THE LION OF LUCERNE.,"There is a height Self-sacrifice may climb, Nearer the throne of God than any star, A height above the wasting tide of Time, Beyond the din of Earth's discordant jar-- A height that untried souls scarce see afar. "
535,THE LION OF LUCERNE.,"On that great height the Lion of Lucerne, With face half-human, with majestic brow, Lies stretched. Oh, Love! that will forever burn On Pain's dread altar, you alone can know The glory and the recompense for Woe! "
537,SONNET TO NIAGARA FALLS.,"As on the brink of that which men call Death, Standing 'twixt Time and dread Eternity, We pause to gaze with fear-suspended breath On that abyss, whose depths we can not see, So now, I stand, above thy thundering fall, Thou Miracle, of marvels most supreme, Who summons all the world, with trumpet call, To adore the heavenly genius of thy stream! In 'wildering confusion, mad disdain Of earthly trammels, earthly tyrannies, Shrieking, like legions of damned souls in pain, Roaring rebellion 'neath the silent skies, Fearful as Death, still thou dost seem to cry, ""I am the symbol of Eternity!"" "
540,THE LOST HEART.,"Where is my heart? Ah! Love, I dare not say, I only know that it is hid away, Somehow,--somewhere,--and somewhat restless there. But safely hid away,--poor heart, somewhere. "
541,THE LOST HEART.,"I strive to call it back to me, but nay,-- That willful heart refuses to obey. And do you ask, thus, in your sad, sweet way-- You, Love, who know so well its secret lair, Where is my heart? "
542,THE LOST HEART.,"Alone, I wait and wonder, day by day, At the poor, pulsing heart, that went astray, Once, in the mazes of a woman's hair. Could it forsake a labyrinth so fair? No need for you to ask, for me to say-- Where is my heart? "
544,IS HE NOT MINE?,"Is he not, mine? Although he drift from me Into the Ocean of the Far Away, Across the tideless and the awful sea Of Time, while I alone must mutely stay Within the doorway of a darkened Day; Although he shake the dust from his light feet, Dust of my warm Heart's Garden, yet I hold, My Love forever, radiant, complete. He breathes upon me when spring buds unfold, He smiles upon me from the roses' gold; I hear him in the tender melody Of mating bird; his laugh rings, glad and free, In every breeze; like stars his dear eyes shine; His spirit is a presence, half-divine, Which clasps, enfolds my being like a sea! Is he not mine? "
546,TWO GIFTS.,"She laughingly gave me a rose, one day, And the thorns were sharp,--but the rose was red, And fragrant and warm from the sun's bright ray, So I clasped the rose, though my fingers bled,-- And it fluttered in petals away. "
547,TWO GIFTS.,"She mockingly offered her heart, one day, And I clasped what she gave, though my own heart bled, I gazed in her eyes, and her soft hair lay On my lips, and I laughed,--though the heart was dead, And crumbled to dust away! "
549,THE MOONFLOWER.,"Earth star of the evening, full moon of the twilight, Pale soul of the dusk, like a virgin in white, With slow graceful motion, so stealthy, so silent, She opens her heart to the kisses of night. "
550,THE MOONFLOWER.,"Chaste blossom, ah! thus, when my own Love approaches, And bends o'er my spirit with fervor divine, Thus would I lay bare, in unbounded devotion, A heart pure and tender and fragrant as thine! "
552,THREE KISSES.,"A rampant wind, on a golden day, Sported and played with a wild, wild rose, He woke her soul from its mute repose, He kissed the heart of the wild, wild rose, And, kissing,--kissed her leaves away,-- And now the wind goes sighing. "
553,THREE KISSES.,"Love won me, on a golden day, He woke my soul, with a kiss sublime, And the whole world vanished, and Death and Time Seemed nought at the touch of that kiss sublime! Love, kissing,--kissed my heart away, And now Love goes rejoicing. "
554,THREE KISSES.,"An Angel came, on pinions gray, In his cold, white arms he clasped my Love! Earth reeled, the sun went out above. Oh! God! I saw Death kiss my Love, And, kissing,--kiss his soul away-- And now my soul goes wailing! "
556,A SONG OF THE WEST.,"Into the glowing West! And lo! the vast and sunburnt plains unfold, An endless, rippling, tideless sea of gold, Our own dear Mother's breast; The gaunt, the silent earth, The bare, brown land without a single tree Or blossom as a home for bird or bee, It lies, endures the dearth, And smiles in spite of thirst And parched and craving lips. This is the best, The better land, my own, my noble West. "
557,A SONG OF THE WEST.,"Into the West! Green, verdant with the strength of endless light, Immortal sunlight, radiant and bright! Where man may work, may rest: This is my paradise, A land of flowers and of singing seas, Of hoary mountain tops and giant trees, Beneath vast arching skies, Skies that are eloquent With sympathy and soft, and deep and true, Gray only when we weary of the blue, Cloudless and all content. "
558,A SONG OF THE WEST.,"Into the West! That mother of great men who sing her praise, Who marvel o'er her miracles and ways, As free and unsuppressed As ocean's roll. Say, O, ye creatures of the further sea, What know ye of her grace and melody, The grandeur of her soul? "
560,TO ESTHER.,"As Night, before the dawn, In starry splendor, seems to brood Above the world, which waits the morn, Yet worships Night in melancholy mood, As Night, in whom a solemn passion lies, So brood and beam my Esther's midnight eyes. "
561,TO ESTHER.,"As sunlight on a rose In flashing radiance seems to glow, Warming the tender heart within, To life and love; as early beams bestow Upon that rose a soul which can beguile A hundred hearts, so beams my Esther's smile. "
562,TO ESTHER.,"As love-birds, in the Spring, Sing on the sylvan boughs at noon, And mating-calls in echoes ring, Or oft at night they whisper to the moon; As stream responds to stream with tender art, So, to mine own, replieth Esther's heart. "
563,TO ESTHER.,"As sea to distant sea, In grand response to Passion's cry, Declares its own vast mystery, And answers wild entreaties with a sigh; As waves to waves melodiously roll, So sings to me forever--Esther's soul. "
565,THE THRUSH.,"It was the Thrush,--it was the joyous Thrush, Who, with his beauteous voice, the woods addressed! He sank from heavens unseen, and in the hush Of floating fragrance and soft-slumbering flowers, Dozing beneath the spell of sun-bright hours, His summer shower of song the glade's deep heart caressed. "
566,THE THRUSH.,"Bright, speckle-breasted, angel-throated bird! He tilted on the hedge, and piped and wooed; Now here a note, now there, so low 'twas heard, Ofttimes, by one deep listening ear, one only, The ear of Silence; he, her minstrel lonely. Was it for her divine mute blessing that he sued? "
567,THE THRUSH.,"How often I have watched him in the grass, Familiar, small, erect, and bravely dressed In spotted golden-brown; have seen him pass Alertly to and fro, all blithely springing, With elfin bounds; no longer wildly winging; Content with Mother Earth, as though he loved her breast. "
568,THE THRUSH.,"Earth born, sky destined, living harp of song, Beloved Thrush, pour forth your notes divine! Whether to earth or heaven you most belong, What the vast purpose of your melody, Your mystic glory, your bright ecstasy, I know not,--only this, your soul is sweet to mine. "
570,THE LIGHT OF THE STAR.,"Dank were the grewsome alleys of the town, Dingy the houses of the dreary street; The very dogs reflected degradation, Gaunt, wolfish; while God's flowers of creation, Young children, lacking all that makes life sweet, Through the foul-smelling night ran up and down. "
571,THE LIGHT OF THE STAR.,"Under a dull street light I watched them play, Shrilling in high-pitched and unchildlike tones, Daring the perils of the tainted city. Then, in my heart, the horror and the pity For human kind that in such blackness groans Rose, and I could not drive the pall away. "
572,THE LIGHT OF THE STAR.,"Amid such concrete evils, inbred sin, I, groping, questioned, could Christ's kingdom come, By any means? How could he ever enter At wealthy portals strong, where self is center, Or at the darkened doors of spirits dumb, Dulled by the ancient slums' unceasing din? "
573,THE LIGHT OF THE STAR.,"But, glancing upward, in my deep distress-- Myself so small an atom of my race-- I saw, above the dreadful hovels shining, A single star. It seemed, my pain divining, To answer from illimitable space, And with its rays to sanctify and bless. "
574,THE LIGHT OF THE STAR.,"Witness it bore of Law by which worlds move, Light of the Soul, the Everlasting Mind, Which--in its compass Earth and Heaven holding-- Is ever like some shining scroll unfolding, And will unfold with Time, till all mankind Shall read Life's one solution, perfect Love. "
576,THE MESSAGE OF THE PINES.,"Tall Southern pines, with hearts of mystic throbbing, Stretch your restless, weary boughs across the sunset sky, Dark Southern pines, whose souls are ever sobbing, I would roam through these dim aisles and learn the music of your sigh. Hark! the wail of hearts that can not weep! Hush! the sigh of souls that long to sleep! "
577,THE MESSAGE OF THE PINES.,"Tall Southern pines, I seek these silent places Only in my memory--a memory beside me moves. Dark Southern pines, I love your solemn spaces, And there in spirit walk, and with her spirit seek the quiet groves. Hark! the moan of human hearts that yearn! Hush! the plaint of dreams that would return! "
578,THE MESSAGE OF THE PINES.,"Tall Southern pines, I wrong you in my sorrow. Harps divine, you chant a dream not passed, but yet to come! Our two souls shall walk together, on some perfect morrow, And through the years remain together, when your voices all are dumb. Hark! her spirit whispers in the grove! Hush! I feel the presence of my Love! "
580,THE LOST SUNBEAM.,"Through fairy green of willows old, Aslant the stately, virgin, cold Form of the sycamore, Where poplars laugh, where beeches pray, Where breezes sigh, where streamlets sing, And birds are ever caroling, One morn, I saw a sunbeam stray; This single, holy, radiant ray On the wide earth had lost its way, Escaped through Heaven's half-open door. "
581,THE LOST SUNBEAM.,"""Where will the sunbeam find its home?"" I idly wondered. ""Will it roam Until it makes its nest Perhaps in some dear baby's hair?"" But no! a baby's tresses shine With their own radiance divine-- The sun of Heaven is always there. Or would it find a secret lair In flowery heart? Nay, in that rare, Deep cell, God's sun long found its rest. "
582,THE LOST SUNBEAM.,"So the lone sunbeam strays at will, And longs for Heaven and rest, until Into the silent grove, An old man, crippled by disease, Creeps down the path, with weary eyes. That are too worn to seek the skies, With palsied limbs and shaking knees, And fixed, dull stare, that only sees The stony ground. Oh! stately trees! Shade this drear form with arms of love! "
583,THE LOST SUNBEAM.,"As he pursues his lonely way Through the green wood, the shining ray Straightway appears to dart To that bent form, and seems to light A glory in the thin white hair; Then, restless still, it makes its lair In the sad eyes, so dim of sight, And, smiling through the sombre night, It deeper sinks, a radiance bright, And nestles in the old man's heart. "
586,HERITAGE.,"Everything beautiful centered in you! All that is fair, in your spirit, my Sweet, From the depths of the sea to the height of the blue, Lies now at my feet. "
587,HERITAGE.,"They are gems, they are gems you have scattered so free, From your zenith of thought they have fallen like rain, From the height of your love they descended to me, In the midst of my pain! "
588,HERITAGE.,"Thoughts like the ocean and dreams like the morn, Pure and unsullied, most holy and true; Dear Love, in my being there shines a new dawn, Whose light is from you! "
