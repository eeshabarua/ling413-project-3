6,"JOHN OVEREND, COOK LANE, KEIGHLEY.","PRINTED AND PUBLISHED BY JOHN OVEREND, COOK LANE, KEIGHLEY. 1891. "
9,PREFACE,"The Author respectfully submits to the general public of his native town and district, this volume of poems, containing some of the chief results of his musings for the past thirty years.  He hopes that the volume, which is in reality the production of a life-time, will in many ways be deemed worthy of the kind and courteous approbation of his numerous patrons and friends, as well as the indulgence of literary critics. "
10,PREFACE,"In launching forth the work, the Author begs to tender to his patrons and the public generally, his most sincere and hearty thanks for the assistance they have ever rendered him so as to enable him to acquire the necessary leisure for the cultivation of his muse.  The result now achieved is not the comprehensive collection of the efforts of the author, but it may he taken as a selection and a representation of his more generally interesting productions from time to time. "
11,PREFACE,"Various reasons have operated in the time of the publication and the curtailment of this volume; but it is now submitted with every respect to the public for their perusal.  Many of his poems, which are not found in the present volume, the author trusts will be deemed worthy of being treasured in the scrap books of his friends.  Of the literary merits of the composition, it would ill become the author in any way to descant upon; but in regard to these he leaves himself entirely and absolutely in the hands of a critical, and, he hopes, an indulgent public, feeling assured that he may trust himself in the hands of his readers. "
12,PREFACE,"No formal dedication is here made to any particular patron, but the book is submitted without the powerful influence of any conspicuous name or the commendation of any well-known literary friend; and like Dr. Johnson of old, failing patrons, he trusts that his work will, in the midst of his numerous competitors, locally and generally, be thought worthy of the attention of the various classes of the public.

18,PAGE,"Come, hand me down that rustic harp, From off that rugged wall, For I must sing another song To suit the Muse's call, For she is bent to sing a poean, On this eventful year, In praise of the philanthropist Whom all his friends hold dear-- The Grand Old Man of Oakworth, Beyond his eightieth year! "
19,PAGE,"No flattery!  My honest Muse, Nor yet be thou servile; But tinkle up that harp again, A moment to beguile. Altho' the bard be rude and rough, Yet, he is ever proud To do the mite that he can do, And thus proclaim aloud-- The Grand Old Man of Oakworth, Of whom we all are proud! "
20,PAGE,"For base indeed were any bard That ever sang on earth, Did he not wish his neighbour well, And praise his sterling worth. Leave state affairs and office To those of younger blood, But I am with the patriot, The noble, wise, and good-- The Grand Old Man of Oakworth, The wise, the great, the good! "
21,PAGE,"This worthy old philanthropist, Whom all his neighbours greet; Who has a smile for every one Whom he may chance to meet-- Go to yon pleasant village, On the margin of the moor, And you will hear his praises sung By all the aged poor-- The Grand Old Man of Oakworth, A friend unto the poor! "
22,PAGE,"Long may he live! and happy be, The patriot and the sire; And may some other harp give praise, Whose notes will sound much higher. His thirst for knowledge, worth, and lore-- His heart was ever there-- This worthy old philanthropist, Beyond his eightieth year!-- The Grand Old Man of Oakworth, Beyond his eightieth year. "
24,ON HEARING,"Though murky are the days and short, And man he finds but little sport, These gloomy days, to cheer him; Yet, if a Dobie should, perchance, Come out before an audience, 'Tis worth our while to hear him. "
25,ON HEARING,"Right pleased was I, dear sir, to hear Your lecture on that subject dear, So grand and superhuman; For all the world doth pay regard To Bobbie Burns, the Scottish bard, The patriot and the ploughman. "
26,ON HEARING,"Your words, indeed, were passing good, On him who kenned and understood The kirk and all its ranting; Who ""held the mirror"" up, indeed, To show the ""muckle unco-guid"" Their double-dyed canting. "
27,ON HEARING,"You painted him sometimes in glee While other times in poverty-- To gold without alliance; Yet, after all he kept his pace, And looked grim fortune in the face, And set him at defiance. "
28,ON HEARING,"But, alas! the picture, was it true? Of Burns' parents, poor and low-- So furrowed and so hoary-- It makes our very hearts to burn To think that ""man was made to mourn,"" And tell the sad, sad story. "
29,ON HEARING,"You brought me back to days bygone, When glad its banks I strolled upon, The river Doon so bonnie; The roofless kirk and yard so green, Where many a tombstone may be seen, With Tam and Souter Johnnie. "
30,ON HEARING,"And when ye spake of yond bright star That lingers in the lift afar, Where Burns was never weary Of gazing on the far-off sphere, Where dwells his angel lassie dear-- His ain sweet Highland Mary! "
31,ON HEARING,"But here my Muse its wings may lower; Such flights are far beyond its power; So I will stop the jingle. Sir, I am much obliged to you, And I am much indebted to The Choir and Mr. Pringle. "
34,ON HEARING,"What profits me tho' I sud be The lord o' yonder castle gay; Hev rooms in state to imitate The princely splendour of the day For what are all my carved doors, My chandeliers or carpet floors, No art could save me from the grave. "
35,ON HEARING,"What profits me tho' I sud be Decked i' costly costumes grand, Like the Persian king o' kings, Wi' diamond rings to deck my hand: For what wor all my grand attire, That fooils both envy and admire, No gems could save me from the grave. "
36,ON HEARING,"What profits me tho' I sud be Thy worthy host, O millionaire, Hev cent. for cent. for money lent; My wealth increasing ivvery year. For what wor all my wealth to me, Compared to immortality, Wealth could not save me from the grave. "
37,ON HEARING,"What profits me tho' I sud be Even the gert Persian Shah, My subjects stand at my command, Wi' fearful aspect and wi' awe; For what wor a despotic rule, Wi' all the world at my control, All could not save me from the grave. "
39,ON HEARING,"From the red fields of gore, 'midst war's dreadful clang, I hear a sad strain o'er oceans afar: Oh, shame, shame upon you, ye proud men of England, Whose highest ambition is rapine and war! Through your vain wickedness Thousands are fatherless, False your pretensions old Egypt to save; Arabs with spear in hand Far in a distant land Made our brave Gordon a sad and red grave. "
40,ON HEARING,"On Nile's sunny banks, with the Arab's great nation, Brave Gordon was honoured and worshipped by all, The acknowledged master of the great situation, Until England's bondholders caused Egypt to fall. Another great blunder, Makes the world wonder, Where is Britannia's sword, sceptre and shield? War and disaster Come thicker and faster, Oh, for the days of the Great Beaconsfield! "
41,ON HEARING,"Oh, Great Beaconsfield! the wise and the clever, When will thy place in our nation be filled? Britannia's shrill answer is never, oh never, My Beaconsfield's dead, and my Gordon is killed! Oh, blame not my foemen Or a Brutus-like Roman, Or Soudanese Arabs for Gordon's sad doom; But blame that vain Briton Whose name is true written, The slayer of Gordon, who fell at Khartoum. "
44,ON HEARING,"I sing no song of superstition, No dark deeds of an Inquisition, No mad-brain'd theme of wild ambition, For lo, their doom is sealed! But I will use my best endeavour, To praise the good, the wise, the clever, Who will remember'd be for ever, The Earl of Beaconsfield. "
45,ON HEARING,"When England was without alliance, He bid the Russians bold defiance, On Austria had no reliance In either flood or field; He proudly sent to Hornby message, The Dardanelles! go force the passage In spite of Turkey, Bear, or Sausage, The dauntless Beaconsfield! "
46,ON HEARING,"At Berlin, he with admiration Was gazed upon by every nation, And, master of the situation, Vow'd Britons ne'er would yield. For I am here, you may depend on't, This Eastern brawl to make an end on't, To show both plaintiff and defendant I'm Earl of Beaconsfield! "
47,ON HEARING,"Britannia now doth weep and ponder, Bereaved of him, her child of wonder, No earthly power could break asunder His love for England's weal. And now those locks once dark as raven (For laurel leaves ne'er deck'd a craven) Wear a laurel crown in Heaven, Glorious Beaconsfield! "
50,ON HEARING,"""Come, nivver dee i' thi shell, owd lad,"" Are words but rudely said; Though they may cheer some stricken heart, Or raise some wretched head; For they are words I love mysel, They're music to my ear; They muster up fresh energy An' chase each doubt an' fear. "
51,ON HEARING,"Nivver dee i' thi shell, owd lad, Though tha be poor indeed; Ner lippen ta long i' th' turnin' up Sa mich ov a friend in need; Fur few ther are, an' far between, That help a poor man thru; An' God helps them at help therseln, An' they hev friends enew. "
52,ON HEARING,"Nivver dee i' thi shell, owd lad, Whativver thi creditors say; Tell um at least tha'rt foarst ta owe, If tha artant able ta pay; An' if they nail thi bits o' traps, An' sell tha dish an' spooin; Remember fickle forten lad, Shoo changes like the mooin. "
53,ON HEARING,"Nivver dee i' thi shell, owd lad, Though some may laugh an' scorn; There wor nivver a neet afore ta neet, Bud what ther' com a morn; An' if blind forten used tha bad, Sho's happen noan so meean; Ta morn al come, an' then fer some The sun will shine ageean. "
54,ON HEARING,"Nivver dee i' thi shell, owd lad, Bud let thi motto be,-- ""Onward!"" an' ""Excelsior;"" An' try for t' top o't' tree: An' if thi enemies still pursue, Which ten-ta-one they will, Show um owd lad, tha'rt doin' weel, An' climin' up the hill. "
56,ON HEARING,"So Mary, lass, tha'rt bahn to wed It mornin', we young Blacksmith Ned, An' though it maks thi mother sad, It's like to be; I've nowt ageean yond dacent lad, No more ner thee. "
57,ON HEARING,"Bud let me tell tha what ta due, For my advise might help tha thru; Be kind, and to thi husband true, An' I'll be bun Tha'll nivver hev a day ta rue For owt that's done. "
58,ON HEARING,"Nah, try to keep thi former knack, An' du thi weshin' in a crack, Bud don't be flaid to bend thi back, Tha'll nobbut sweeat; So try an' hev a bit o' tack, An' du it neeat. "
59,ON HEARING,"Be sure tha keeps fra bein' a flirt, An' pride thysel i' bein' alert,-- An' mind ta mend thi husband's shirt, An' keep it cleean; It wod thi poor owd mother hurt, If tha wur meean. "
60,ON HEARING,"Don't kal abaht like monny a wun, Then hev to broil, an' sweeat, an' run; Bud alus hev thi dinner done Withaht a mooild; If it's nobbut meil, lass, set it on, An' hev it boiled. "
61,ON HEARING,"Now Mary, I've no more ta say-- Tha gets thi choice an' tak thi way; An' if tha leets to rue, I pray, Don't blame thi mother: I wish yeh monny a happy day Wi wun another. "
63,ON HEARING,"So, Ned, awm geen ta understand, Tha'rt bahn ta join i' wedlock band, Ta travil thru life's weeary strand, Yond lass an' thee; But if yer joinin' heart an' hand, It pleases me. "
64,ON HEARING,"Nah tha'll hev trubbles, Ned, ta bear, While pushin' thru this world o' care, An' wat tha'll hev it face ta stare, It's hard ta tell; Life's ups and dahns tha'll get ta share, So pleas thisel'. "
65,ON HEARING,"Tha'rt weel an' strong, long may it last; But age an' care creep on us fast; Then act az tha can luke at t'past An' feel no shaam; Then if tha'rt poor az sum ahtcast, Tha'rt noan ta blame. "
66,ON HEARING,"Doant sport abaht an' wagers bet, But mind an' shun that foolish set At cannut mak ther awn ta fet, Though shaam to say it. An' mind tha keeps fra bein' i' debt, An' tha'll be reight. "
67,ON HEARING,"Nah stick fast hod o' iron will; Push boldly on an' feear no ill; Keep Him i' veiw, whoa's mercies fill The wurld sa wide. No daht but His omnishent skill Al be thi guide. "
68,ON HEARING,"So Ned, mi lad, tak this advice, Prove worthy o' yond lass's choice, I' years ta cum tha may rejoice Tha tuke her hand; An' listened ta thi father's voice, An' his command. "
70,ON HEARING,"Aw remember the days o' mi bell-button jacket, Wi' its little lappels hangin' down ower mi waist, An' mi grand bellosed cap,--noan nicer I'll back it,-- Fer her at hed bowt it wur noan withaht taste; Fer shoo wur mi mother an' I wur her darling, An often shoo vowed it, an' stroked dahn mi hair, An' shoo tuke ma to see her relashuns i' Harden It furst Pair o' Briches at ivver aw ware. "
71,ON HEARING,"Aw remember the time when Aunt Betty an' Alice Sent fer me up to lewk at mi cloas, An aw wauked up as prahd as a Frenchman fra Calais, Wi' mi tassel at t'side--i' mi jacket a rose. Aw sooin saw mi uncles, both Johnny an' Willy, They both gav me pennies, an' off aw did steer: But aw heeard um say this, ""He's a fine lad is Billy,"" It furst Pair o' Briches at ivver aw ware. "
72,ON HEARING,"Aw remember t' time at ahr Robin and Johnny Wur keeping their hens an' ducks i' t' yard, Tha wur gamecocks an' bantams, wi' toppins so bonny, An' noan on um mine--aw thowt it wur hard. But aw saved up mi pennies aw gat fer mail pickin', An' sooin gat a shilling by saving it fair, Aw then became maister at least o' wun chicken, It furst Pair o' Briches at ivver aw ware. "
73,ON HEARING,"Aw remember wun Sabbath, an' t'sun it wor shining, Aw went wi' mi father ta Hainworth ta sing; An' t'stage wur hung raand wi' bottle-green lining; And childer i' white made t' village ta ring. We went ta owd Meshach's that day ta wur drinkin', Though poor, tha wur plenty, an' summat ta spare; Says Meshach, ""That lad, Jim, is just thee, aw'm thinking, It furst Pair o' Briches at ivver tha ware."" "
74,ON HEARING,"Now them wur the days o' grim boggards and witches, When Will-o'-the-wisp cud be seen in the swamp, But nah are the days o' cheating fer riches, An' a poor honest man is classed wi' a scamp. Yes, them wur the days at mi mind worrant weary; O them wur the days aw knew no despair; O give me the time o' the boggard an' fairy, Wi' t' furst Pair o' Briches at ivver aw ware. "
75,ON HEARING,"Ah! them wur the days aw sall allus remember, Sud aw just as owd as Mathusalah last; Them wur mi March days, but nah it's September: Ne'er to return again--them days are past. But a time aw remember aboon onny other, Aw kneeled o' mi knees an' sed the Lord's Prayer; Aw sed ""God bless mi father, an' God bless mi mother,"" It furst Pair o' Briches at ivver aw ware. "
77,ON HEARING,"O welcome, lovely summer, Wi' thi golden days so long, When the throstle and the blackbird Do charm us wi' ther song; When the lark in early morning Takes his aerial flight; An' the humming bat an' buzzard Frolic in the night. "
78,ON HEARING,"O! welcome, lovely summer, With her rainbow's lovely form; Her thunner an' her leetnin', An' her grandeur in the storm: With her sunshine an' her shower, An' her whirlin' of the dust, An' the maiden with her flagon, To sleck the mower's thirst. "
79,ON HEARING,"O! welcome, lovely summer, When the woods wi' music ring, An' the bees so heavy laden, To their hives their treasures bring: When we seek some shady bower, Or some lovely little dell, Or, bivock in the sunshine, Besides some cooling well. "
80,ON HEARING,"O! welcome, lovely summer, With her roses in full bloom; When the cowslaps an' the laalek Deck the cottage home; When the cherry an' the berry Give a grandeur to the charm; And the clover and the haycock Scent the little farm. "
81,ON HEARING,"O! welcome, lovely summer, Wi' the partridge on the wing; When the tewit an' the moorgam, Up fra the heather spring, From the crowber an' the billber, An' the bracken an' the whin; As from the noisy tadpole, We hear the crackin' din. O! welcome, lovely summer. "
83,ON HEARING,"Go bring that tuther whisky in, An' put no watter to it; Fur I mun drink a bumper off, To Scotland's darlin' poet. "
84,ON HEARING,"It's just one hunderd year to-day, This Jenewarry morn, Sin' in a lowly cot i' Kyle, A rustic bard wur born. "
85,ON HEARING,"He kittled up his muirland harp, To ivvery rustic scene; An' sung the ways o' honest men, His Davey an' his Jean. "
86,ON HEARING,There wur nivver a bonny flaar that grew Bud what he could admire; There wur nivver lovely hill or dale That suited not his lyre. 
87,ON HEARING,"At last owd Coilia sed enough, Mi bardy thah did sing, Then gently tuke his muirland harp, And brack it ivvery string. "
88,ON HEARING,"An' bindin' up the holly wreath, Wi' all its berries red, Shoo placed it on his noble brow, An' pensively shoo said:-- "
89,ON HEARING,"""So long as Willies brew ther malt, An' Robs and Allans spree; Mi Burns's songs an' Burns's name, Remember'd they shall be."" "
91,ON HEARING,"Ligging here deead, mi poor Ann Lavina, Ligging alone, mi own darling child, Just thi white hands crost on thi bosom, Wi' features so tranquil, so calm, and so mild. "
92,ON HEARING,"Ligging here deead, so white an' so bonny, Hidding them eyes that oft gazed on mine; Asking for summat withaht ever speaking, Asking thi father to say tha wur fine. "
93,ON HEARING,"Ligging here deead, the child that so lov'd me, At fane wod ha' hidden mi faults if shoo could; Wal thi wretch of a father despairin' stands ower tha, Wal remorse and frenzy are freezin' his blood. "
94,ON HEARING,"Ligging here deead, i' thi shroud an thi coffin, Ligging alone in this poor wretched room; Just thi white hands crossed ower thi bosom, Waiting for t'angels to carry tha home. "
96,ON HEARING,"[Having spent the whole of the afternoon in this romantic little glen, indulging in pleasant meditations, I began to wend my way down the craggy pass that leads to the bonny little hamlet of Goose Eye, and turning round to take a last glance at this enchanting vale--with its running whimpering stream--I beheld the ""Lass o' Newsholme Dean.""  She was engaged in driving home a Cochin China hen and her chickens. Instantaneously I was seized with a poetic fit, and gazing upon her as did Robert Tannyhill upon his imaginary beauty, ""The Flower of Dumblane,"" I struck my lyre, and, although the theme of my song turned out afterwards to be a respectable old woman of 70 winters, yet there is still a charm in my ""Lass o' Newsholme Dean.""] "
97,ON HEARING,"Thy kiss is sweet, thy words are kind, Thy love is all to me; Aw couldn't in a palace find A lass more true ner thee: An' if aw wor the Persian Shah, An' thee mi Lovely Queen, The grandest diamond i' mi Crown Wor t' lass o' Newsholme Dean. "
98,ON HEARING,"The lady gay may heed tha not, An' passing by may sneer; The upstart squire's dowters laugh, When thou, my love, art near; But if all ther shinin' soverins War wared o' sattens green, They mightn't be as handsome then As t' Lass o' Newsholme Dean. "
99,ON HEARING,"When yellow autumn's lustre shines, An' hangs her golden ear, An' nature's voice fra every bush Is singing sweet and clear, 'Neath some white thorn to song unknown, To mortal never seen, 'Tis there with thee I fain wad be, Mi Lass o' Newsholme Dean. "
100,ON HEARING,"Od drat, who cares fur kings or queens, Mix'd in a nation's broil, They nivver benefit the poor-- The poor mun ollas toil. An' thou gilded spectre, royalty, That dazzles folks's een, Is nowt to me when I'm wi thee, Sweet Lass o' Newsholme Dean. "
101,ON HEARING,"High fra the summit o' yon' crag, I view yon' smooky town, Where forten she has deigned to smile On monny a simple clown: Though free fra want, they're free fra brains; An' yet no happier I ween, Than this old farmer's wife an' hens, Aw saw i' Newsholme Dean. "
103,ON HEARING,"[The happiest moments of a soldier in times of peace are when sat round the hearth of his neat little barrack room, along with his comrades, spinning yarns and telling tales; sometimes giving the history of some famous battle or engagement in which he took a prominent part; other times he will relate his own love adventures; then the favourite of the room will oblige them with his song of ""Nelson"" or ""Napoleon"" (generally being the favourites with them);--then there is the fancy tale teller, who amuses all.  But in all cases the teller of a tale, yarn, or story, makes himself the hero of it, and especially when he speaks of the lass he left behind him; hence this adventure with the ""Lassie by the Well.""] "
104,ON HEARING,"There was a bonny Lassie once Sitting by a well-- But what this bonny Lassie thought I cannot, cannot tell-- When by there went a cavalier Well known as Willie Wright, Just in full marching order, His armour shining bright. "
105,ON HEARING,"""Ah maiden, lovely maiden, why Sits thou by the spring? Dost thou seek a lover, with A golden wedding ring? Or wherefore dost thou gaze on me, With eyes so bright and wide? Or wherefore does that pitcher lay Broken by thy side?"" "
106,ON HEARING,"""My pitcher it is broken, sir, And this the reason is, A villian came behind me, An' he tried to steal a kiss. I could na take his nonsense, So ne'er a word I spoke, But hit him with my pitcher, And thus you see 'tis broke."" "
107,ON HEARING,"""My uncle Jock McNeil, ye ken Now waits for me to come; He canna mak his Crowdy, Till t'watter it goes home. I canna tak him watter, And that I ken full weel, And so I'm sure to catch it,-- For he'll play the varry de'il."" "
108,ON HEARING,"""Ah maiden, lovely maiden, I pray be ruled by me; Smile with thine eyes and ruby lips, And give me kisses three. And we'll suppose my helmet is A pitcher made o' steel, And we'll carry home some watter To thy uncle Jock McNeil."" "
109,ON HEARING,"She silently consented, for She blink'd her bonny ee, I threw mi arms around her, And gave her kisses three. To wrong the bonny Lassie I sware 'twould be a sin; So knelt dahn by the watter To dip mi helmet in. "
110,ON HEARING,"Out spake this bonny Lassie, ""My soldier lad, forbear, I wadna spoil thi bonny plume That decks thi raven hair; Come buckle up thy sword again, Put on thi cap o' steel, I carena for my pitcher, nor My uncle Jock McNeil."" "
111,ON HEARING,"I often think, my comrades, About this Northern queen, And fancy that I see her smile, Though mountains lay between. But should you meet her Uncle Jock, I hope you'll never tell How I squared the broken pitcher, With the Lassie at the well. "
113,ON HEARING,"Go, string once more old Ebor's harp, And bring it here to me, For I must sing another song, The theme of which shall be,-- A worthy old philanthropist, Whose soul in goodness soars, And one whose name will stand as firm As rocks that gird our shores; The fine old Bradford gentleman, The good Sir Titus Salt. "
114,ON HEARING,"Heedless of others; some there are, Who all their days employ To raise themselves, no matter how, And better men destroy: How different is the mind of him, Whose deeds themselves are told, Who values worth more nobly far Than all the heaps of gold. "
115,ON HEARING,"His feast and revels are not such, As those we hear and see, No princely show does he indulge, Nor feats of revelry; But in the orphan schools they are, Or in the cot with her, The widow and the orphan of The shipwrecked mariner, "
116,ON HEARING,"When stricken down with age and care, His good old neighbours grieved, Or loss of family or mate, Or all on earth bereaved; Go see them in their houses, Where peace their days may end, And learn from them the name of him Who is their aged friend. "
117,ON HEARING,"With good and great his worth shall live, With high or lowly born; His name is on the scroll of fame, Sweet as the songs of morn; While tyranny and villany Is surely stamped with shame; A nation gives her patriot A never-dying fame. "
118,ON HEARING,"No empty titles ever could His principles subdue, His queen and country too he loved,-- Was loyal and was true: He craved no boon from royalty, Nor wished their pomp to share, Far nobler is the soul of him, The founder of Saltaire. "
119,ON HEARING,"Thus lives this sage philanthropist, From courtly pomp removed, But not secluded from his friends, For frienship's bond he loved; A noble reputation too Crowns all his latter days; The young men they admire him, And the aged they him praise. "
120,ON HEARING,"Long life to thee, Sir Titus, The darling of our town; Around thy head while living, We'll weave a laurel crown. Thy monument in marble May suit the passer by, But a monument in all our hearts Will never, never die. "
121,ON HEARING,"And when thy days are over, And we miss thee on our isle, Around thy tomb for ever May unfading laurels smile: Then may the sweetest flowers Usher in the spring; And roses in the gentle gales, Their balmy odours fling. "
122,ON HEARING,"May summer's beams shine sweetly, Upon thy hallowed clay, And yellow autumn o'er thy head, Yield many a placid ray; May winter winds blow slightly,-- The green-grass softly wave, And falling snow drop lightly Upon thy honoured grave. "
124,ON HEARING,"An' arta fra thi father torn, So early i' thi youthful morn, An' mun aw pine away forlorn, I' grief an' pain? Fer consolashun I sall scorn If tha be ta'en. "
125,ON HEARING,"O yes, tha art, an' aw mun wail Thi loss through ivvery hill an' dale, Fer nah it is too true a tale, Tha'rt cowd az leead. An' nah thi bonny face iz pale, Tha'rt deead! tha'rt deead'! "
126,ON HEARING,"Aw's miss tha when aw cum fra t'shop, An' see thi bat, an' ball, an' top; An' aw's be ommust fit ta drop, Aw sall so freeat, An' Oh! mi varry heart may stop An' cease to beeat! "
127,ON HEARING,"Ah'd allus aimed, if tha'd been spar'd, Of summat better to hev shared Ner what thi poor owd father fared, I' this cowd sphere; Yet, after all, aw'st noan o' cared If tha'd stayed here. "
128,ON HEARING,"But O!  Tha Conquerer Divine, 'At vanquished deeath i' Palestine, Tak to Thi arms this lad o' mine Noan freely given; But mak him same as wun o' Thine, Wi' Thee i' Heaven. "
130,ON HEARING,"Shoo stud beside her looms an' watch'd The shuttle passin' through, But yet her soul wur sumweer else, 'Twor face ta face wi' Joe. They saw her lips move as in speech, Yet none cud hear a word, An' but fer t'grindin' o' the wheels, This language might be heard. "
131,ON HEARING,"""I't' spite o' all thi treacherous art, At length aw breeathe again; The pityin' stars hes tane mi part, An' eas'd a wretch's pain. An' Oh! aw feel as fra a maze, Mi rescued soul is free, Aw knaw aw do not dream an daze I' fancied liberty. "
132,ON HEARING,"""Extinguished nah is ivvery spark, No love for thee remains, Fer heart-felt love i' vain sall strive Ta live, when tha disdains. No longer when thi name I hear, Mi conscious colour flies! No longer when thi face aw see, Mi heart's emotions rise. "
133,ON HEARING,"""Catcht i' the bird-lime's treacherous twigs, Ta wheer he chonc'd ta stray, The bird his fastened feathers leaves, Then gladly flies away. His shatter'd wings he sooin renews, Of traps he is aware; Fer by experience he is wise, An' shuns each future snare. "
134,ON HEARING,"""Awm speikin' nah, an' all mi aim Is but ta pleeas mi mind; An' yet aw care not if mi words Wi' thee can credit find. Ner dew I care if my decease Sud be approved bi thee; Or whether tha wi' equal ease Does tawk ageean wi' me. "
135,ON HEARING,"""But, yet, tha false deceivin' man, Tha's lost a heart sincere; Aw naw net which wants comfort mooast, Or which hes t'mooast ta fear. But awm suer a lass more fond an' true No lad could ivver find: But a lad like thee is easily fun-- False, faithless, and unkind."" "
137,ON HEARING,"Sweetest warbler of the wood, Rise thy soft bewitching strain, And in pleasure's sprightly mood, Soar again. "
138,ON HEARING,"With the sun's returning beam, First appearance from the east, Dimpling every limpid stream, Up from rest. "
139,ON HEARING,"Thro' the airy mountains stray, Chant thy welcome songs above, Full of sport and full of play, Songs of love. "
140,ON HEARING,"When the evening cloud prevails, And the sun gives way for night, When the shadows mark the vales, Return thy flight. "
141,ON HEARING,"Like the cottar or the swain, Gentle shepherd, or the herd; Rest thou till the morn again, Bonny bird! "
142,ON HEARING,"Like thee, on freedom's airy wing, May the poet's rapturous spark, Hail the first approach of spring, Bonny lark! "
144,ON HEARING,"Home of my boyish days, how can I call Scenes to my memory, that did befall? How can my trembling pen find power to tell The grief I experienced in bidding farewell? Can I forget the days joyously spent, That flew on so rapidly, sweet with content? Can I then quit thee, whose memory's so dear, Home of my boyish days, without one tear? "
145,ON HEARING,"Can I look back on happy days gone by, Without one pleasant thought, without one sigh Ah, no! though never more these eyes may dwell On thee, old cottage home, I love so well: Home of my childhood! wherever I be, Thou art the nearest and dearest to me! "
146,ON HEARING,"Can I forget the songs sung by my sire, Like some prophetic bard tuning the lyre? Sweet were the notes that he taught to the young; Psalms for the Sabbath, on Sabbath were sung; And the young minstrels enraptured would come To the little lone cottage I once called my home. "
147,ON HEARING,"Can I forget the dear landscape around, Where in my boyish days I could be found, Stringing my hazel-bow, roaming the wood, Fancying myself to be bold Robin Hood? Then would my mother say--""Where is he gone? I'm waiting for shuttles that he should have 'wun'?""-- She in that cottage there, knitting her healds, And I, her young forester, roaming the fields. "
148,ON HEARING,"But the shades of the evening gather slowly around, The twilight it thickens and darkens the ground, Night's sombre mantle is spreading the plain. And as I turn round to look on thee again, To take one fond look, one last fond adieu, By night's envious hand thou art snatched from my view; But Oh! there's no darkness--to me--no decay, Home of my boyhood, can chase thee away! "
150,ON HEARING,"O welcome, young princess, thou sweetest of dowters, An' furst bloomin' issue o' King Sixty-four, Wi' thi brah deck'd wi' gems o' the purest o' waters, Tha tells us thi sire, stern winter, is ower. "
151,ON HEARING,"We hail thi approach wi' palm-spangled banners; The plant an' the saplin' await thi command; An' Natur herseln, to show her good manners, Nah spreads her green mantle all ower the land. "
152,ON HEARING,"Tha appears in t' orchard, in t' garden, an' t' grotto, Where sweet vegetation anon will adorn; Tha smiles on the lord no more than the cottar, For thi meanest o' subjects tha nivver did scorn. "
153,ON HEARING,"O hasten ta labour! ye wise, O be goin'! These words they are borne on the wings o' the wind; That bids us be early i' plewin' an' sowin', Fer him at neglects, tha'll leave him behind. "
155,ON HEARING,"I' sooth shoo wor a reeal God-send, Ta t' human race the greatest friend, An' liv'd, no daht, at t'other end O' history. Her name is nah, yah may depend, A mystery. "
156,ON HEARING,"But sprang shoo up fra royal blood, Or some poor slave beyond the Flood, Mi blessing on the sooap an' sud Shoo did invent; Her name sall renk ameng the good, If aw get sent. "
157,ON HEARING,"If nobbut in a rainy dub, Shoo did at furst begin ta skrub, Or hed a proper weshin' tub-- It's all the same; Aw'd give a crahn, if aw'd to sub, To get her name. "
158,ON HEARING,"I' this wide world aw'm set afloat, Th' poor regg'd possessor of one coat; Yet linen clean, aw on tha dote, An' thus assert, Tha'rt worthy o' great Shakespeare's note-- A clean lin' shirt. "
159,ON HEARING,"Low is mi lot, an' hard mi ways, While paddlin' thro' life's stormy days; Yet aw will sing t'owd lass's praise, Wi' famous glee; Tho' rude an' rough sud be mi lays, Shoo's t'lass for me. "
160,ON HEARING,"Bards hev sung the fairest fair, Their rosy cheeks an' auburn hair; The dying lover's deep despair, Their harps hev rung; But useful wimmin's songs are rare, An' seldom sung. "
162,ON HEARING,"In a pleasant little valley near the ancient town of Ayr, Where the laddies they are honest, and the lassies they are fair; Where Doon in all her splendour ripples sweetly through the wood, And on its banks not long ago a little cottage stood; 'Twas there, in all her splendour, on a January morn, Appeared old Coila's genius--when Robert Burns was born. "
163,ON HEARING,"Her mantle large of greenish hue and robe of tartan shone, And round its mystic border seen was Luger, Ayr, and Doon; A leaf-clad holly bough was twined so graceful round her brow, She was the darling native muse of Scotia then, as now: So grand old Coila's genius on this January morn, Appeared in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born. "
164,ON HEARING,"She vowed she ne'er would leave him till he sung old Scotia's plains-- The daisy, and the milk-white thorn he tuned in lovely strains; And sung of yellow autumn, or some lovely banks and braes: And make each cottage home resound with his sweet tuneful lays, And sing how Coila's genius, on a January morn, Appeared in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born. "
165,ON HEARING,"She could not teach him painting like her Cunningham at home, Nor could she teach him sculpturing like Angelo of Rome; But she taught him how to wander her lovely hills among, And sing her bonny burns and glens in simple rustic song; This old Coila's genius did that January morn, Vow in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born. "
166,ON HEARING,"And in the nights of winter, when stormy winds do roar, And the fierce dashing waves are heard on Ayr's old craggy shore, The young and old encircled around the cheerful fire, Will talk of Rob the Ploughman and tune the Scottish lyre; And sing how Coila's genius on a January morn, Appeared in all her splendour when Robert Burns was born. "
167,A TALE O' POVERTY,John o'f' Bog an' Keighley Feffy Goast: A TALE O' POVERTY 
168,A TALE O' POVERTY,"""Some books are lies fra end to end, And some great lies were never penn'd; But this that I am gaun to tell, * * * Lately on a night befel.""--BURNS. "
169,A TALE O' POVERTY,"'Twor twelve o'clock wun winter's neet, Net far fra Kersmas time, When I met wee this Feffy Goast, The subject of mi rhyme. "
170,A TALE O' POVERTY,"I'd been hard up fer monny a week, Mi way I cuddant see, Fer trade an' commerce wor as bad As ivver they could be. "
171,A TALE O' POVERTY,"T'poor hand-loom chaps wor running wild, An' t'combers wor quite sick, Fer weeks they nivver pool'd a slip, Ner t'weivers wave a pick. "
172,A TALE O' POVERTY,"An' I belong'd ta t'latter lot, An' them wor t'war o't' two, Fer I'd nine pair o' jaws i' t'haase, An nowt for 'em ta do. "
173,A TALE O' POVERTY,"T'owd wife at t' time wor sick i' bed, An' I'd a shockin' cowd, Wal t'youngest barn we hed at home, Wor nobbut three days owd. "
174,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Distracted to mi varry heart, At sitch a bitter cup, An' lippenin' ivvery day at com, At summat wod turn up; "
175,A TALE O' POVERTY,"At last I started off wun neet, To see what I could mak; Determin'd I'd hev summat ta eit, Or else I'd noan go back. "
176,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Through t'Skantraps an' be t' Bracken Benk, I tuke wi' all mi meet; Be t' Wire Mill an' Ingrow Loin, Reight into t' oppen street. "
177,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Saint John's Church spire then I saw, An' I wor rare an' fain, Fer near it stood t'owd parsonage-- I cuddant be mistain. "
178,A TALE O' POVERTY,"So up I went ta t' Wicket Gate, Though sad I am ta say it, Resolv'd to ax 'em for some breead, Or else some brocken meit. "
179,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Bud just as I wor shackin' it, A form raase up before, An' sed ""What does ta want, tha knave, Shackin' t' Wicket Door?"" "
180,A TALE O' POVERTY,"He gav me then ta understand, If I hedant come to pray, At t'grace o' God an' t'breead o' life, Wor all they gav away. "
181,A TALE O' POVERTY,"It's fearful nice fer folk ta talk Abaat ther breead o' life, An' specially when they've plenty, Fer t'childer an' ther wife. "
182,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Bud I set off ageean at t'run, Fer I weel understood, If I gat owt fra that thear clahn, It woddant do ma good. "
183,A TALE O' POVERTY,"I' travellin' on I thowt I heeard, As I went nearer t'tahn, A thaasand voices i' mi ears, Sayin' ""John, whear are ta bahn?"" "
184,A TALE O' POVERTY,"In ivvery grocer's shop I pass'd, A play-card I could see, I' t'biggest type at e'er wod print-- ""There's nowt here, lad, fer thee."" "
185,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Wal ivvery butcher's shop I pass'd, Asteead o' meit wor seen, A mighty carvin'-knife hung up, Reight fair afore mi een. "
186,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Destruction wor invitin' me, I saw it fearful clear, Fer ivvery druggist window sed-- ""Real poison is sold here."" "
187,A TALE O' POVERTY,"At last I gav a frantic howl, A shaat o' dreead despair, I seized missen by t'toppin then, An' shack'd an' lugged mi hair. "
188,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Then quick as leetnin' ivver wor, A thowt com i' mi heead-- I'd tak a walk to t'Simetry, An' meditate wi' t'deead. "
189,A TALE O' POVERTY,"T'owd Church clock wor striking' t' time At folk sud be asleep, Save t'Bobbies at wor on ther beat, An' t'Pindar after t'sheep. "
190,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Wi' lengthen'd pace I hasten'd off At summat like a trot; Ta get ta t'place I started for, Mi blood wor boiling hot. "
191,A TALE O' POVERTY,"An' what I saw at Lackock Gate, Rear'd up ageean a post, I cuddant tell--but yet I thowt It wor another goast! "
192,A TALE O' POVERTY,"But whether it wor a goast or net, I heddant time ta luke, Fer I wor takken bi surprise When turning t'Sharman's Nuke. "
193,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Abaat two hunderd yards i' t'front, As near as I could think, I thowt I heeard a dreeadful noise, An' nah an' then a clink! "
194,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Whativver can these noises be? Some robbers, then I thowt!-- I'd better step aside an' see, They're happen up ta nowt! "
195,A TALE O' POVERTY,"So I gat ower a fence ther wor, An' peeping threw a gate, Determin'd to be satisfied, If I'd a while to wait. "
196,A TALE O' POVERTY,"At last two figures com ta t'spot Whear I hed hid misel, Then walkers'-earth and brimstone, Most horridly did smell. "
197,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Wun on em hed a nine-tail'd cat, His face as black as sooit, His name, I think wor Nickey Ben, He hed a clovven fooit. "

208,A TALE O' POVERTY,"This made owd Nick fair raging mad, An' liftin' up his whip, He gav owd Spinnel Shanks a lash Across his upper lip. "
209,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Then like a neighin' steed, lean Shanks, To give owd Nick leg bail, He started off towards the tahn, Wi' Nick hard on his trail. "
210,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Then helter-skelter off they went, As ower t'fence I lape; I thowt--well, if it matters owt, I've made a nice escape. "
211,A TALE O' POVERTY,"But nah the mooin began ta shine As breet as it could be; An dahn the vale of t'Aire I luked, Whear I could plainly see. "
212,A TALE O' POVERTY,"The trees wor deeadly pale wi' snaw, An' t'windin' Aire wor still, An' all wor quite save t'hullats, At wor screamin' up o't' hill. "
213,A TALE O' POVERTY,"Owd Rivock End an' all arahnd Luk'd like some fiendish heead, Fer t'more I star'd an' t'more I thowt It did resemble t'deead. "
214,A TALE O' POVERTY,"The Friendly Oaks wor alter'd nah, Ta what I'd seen afore; An' luk'd as though they'd nivver be T'owd Friendly Oaks no more. "

218,A TALE O' POVERTY,"I heddant goan so far agean, Afoar I heeard a voice, Exclaiming--wi' a fearful groan-- ""Go mak a hoil i' t'ice!"" "
219,A TALE O' POVERTY,"I turned ma rahnd wheer t'sahnd com fro, An' cautiously I bowed, Sayin' ""Thenk ye, Mr. Magic Voice, I'm flaid o' gettin' cowd."" "
220,A TALE O' POVERTY,"But nah a sudden shack tuke place, A sudden change o' scene; Fer miles wheer all wor white afoar, Wor nah a bottle-green. "

293,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"He can trundle such words from his serpent-like tongue As fairly bewilder both old men and young; He can make some believe that's black which is white, And others believe it is morn when it's night. "
294,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"He has tampered with kings, and connived with the Czar; His Bulgarian twaddle once caused a great war, Where thousands were slain, but what did he heed, He still went to Church the lessons to read. "
295,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"A bumbailey army to Egypt he sent, In search of some money which long had been spent; He blew up the forts, then commended his men, And ordered them back to old England again. "

322,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"Dark is the visage of the rugged old ocean, To the caves in the billow he rides his foamed steed: As o'er the grim surge with his chariot in motion, He spreads desolation, and laughs at the deed. "
323,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"No more with the tempest the river is swelling, No angry clouds frown, nor sky darkly lower; The bee sounds her horn, and the gay news is telling That spring is established with sunshine and shower. "
324,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"In the pride of its beauty the young year is shining, And nature with blossom is wreathing the trees; The white and the green in rich clusters entwining, And sprinkling their sweets on the wings of the breeze. "
325,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"O May, lovely goddess! what name can be grander? What sunbeam so bright as thine own smiling eye; With thy mantle of green, richly spangled in splendour, At whose sight the last demon of winter doth fly? "
326,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"From her home in the grass see the primrose is peeping, While diamond dew-drops around her are spread; She smiles thro' her tears like an infant that's sleeping, And to laughter is changed as her sorrows are fled. "
327,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"The landscape around is now sprinkled with flowers, The mountains are blue in their distant array; The wreaths of green leaves are refreshed with the showers, Like a moth in the sunshine the lark flies away. "
328,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,How joyous the reapers their harvest songs singing As they see the maid bring the flagon and horn; And the goddess of plenty benedictions is flinging Over meadows and pastures and barley and corn. 
329,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"'Tis sweet on the hills with the morning sun shining, To watch the rich vale as it brightens below; 'Tis sweet in the valley when day is declining, To mark the fair mountains, deep tinged with its glow. "
330,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"Now is the time when biting old Boreas, True to his calling, the tempests impend; His hailstones in fury are pelting before us, Our fingers are smarting, and heads they are bent. "
331,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"The cold winds do murmur, the bleak snow is falling, The beasts of the forest from hunger do call; There are desolate evenings, comfortless mornings, And gloomy noontides for one and for all. "
332,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"Drear is thine aspect, tyrannical December, O hast thou no mercy for the pitiless poor; Christmas is thine, and well we remember, Though dark is thy visage, we honour thee more. "
334,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"Oh, bonnie Cliffe Castle! what sight can be grander? Thou picture of beauty and joy to the eye, So noble and grand in thy beauty and splendour That envy must tremble as she passeth by. "
335,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"And long may'st thou flourish and bloom like the heather, An honour to him who's thy founder so great, And stand like an oak in both fair and foul weather, Till old Father Time hath forgotten thy date. "
336,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"'Tis a pleasure to view thee from hill-top or level, From moorland, from meadow, or mountain afar, Where Roman pack-horsemen more safely could travel, In days when the Briton and Boman waged war. "
337,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"In those days of yore, from Hawkcliffe to Rivoc, The wolf and the wild boar sought after their prey, But Briton's brave sons amongst them made havoc, And thus for Cliffe Castle they opened the way. "
338,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"Where erst were wild woods, crags, moorlands, and marshes, In days long gone by and whose dates are unknown, Is now the highway where stand thy proud arches, Oh, bonnie Cliffe Castle! thou pride of the town. "
339,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"'Tis true that thy walls were not built for defence, Nor that thy equipments befit thee for war; A castle of love is thy only pretence, A name that is higher and nobler by far. "
340,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"Thou 'mind'st me of five as kind-hearted brothers, As ever set sail on the deep ocean's breast, Whose lives have been spent in love toward others, And while blessing others themselves have been blest. "
341,MR. THOMAS CRAVEN.,"Like heroes of old, on horse or on vessel, On land or on water they fought and they won, And now thy grand towers, O bonnie Cliffe Castle! Tower up to the heavens, which answer, ""Well done!"" "

In the same year of your Majesty's coronation, in a wild part of old Yorkshire, where it is said the wind never blew nor the cock ever crew, was your Most Gracious Majesty's humble servant born; and at the very hour that your Majest ascended the Throne, a kind, good Yorkshire mother was rocking her baby in an old oak cradle, while the father was treading the treadles and picking the shuttle of his old hand-loom to the tune of ""Britons never shall be slaves""; and I am proud to convey to your Majesty that the child in the old oak cradle was no less a person than your Majesty's humble and obedient servant, Bill o'th' Hoylus End, Poet and Philosopher to the plebians of Keighley, and who now rejoices in the fiftieth year of your Majesty's reign that he has been blessed with good health during that long period, having had at no time occasion to call in a physician.  John Barleycorn has been my medical adviser, and when I begin to review the fifty years of your most illustrious reign, from my birth, I feel grateful indeed, for great and mighty men and nations have risen and fallen; but I am proud to think that your Most Gracious Majesty and your humble servant have weathered the storm, and I also can assure your Majesty that the lukewarm loyalty of the upper ten is not a sample of people here, for during the latter half of your Majesty's reign up to now prosperity has shone upon the once crooked, old, mis-shapen town, for wealth has been accumulated to the tune of millions, which I am sorry to inform your Majesty is in the hands of those who mean to keep it.  One portion of your Majesty's lukewarm loyal subjects have the advancement of art and science so much on the brain that it is feared they will go stark mad.  I have also much pleasure in informing your gracious Majesty that His Grace the Duke of Devonshire has presented the people of Keighley with a plot of ground to be called the Devonshire Park, which will be opened on the occasion of your Majesty's Jubilee; also that Henry Isaac Butterfield, Esquire, of bonny Cliffe Castle, has erected a noble-looking structure, to be called the Jubilee Tower, which will be opened on the day of your Majesty's Grand Jubilee, to commemorate your Majesty's glorious reign.  This gentleman is a native of Keighley, and fairly entitled to be knighted by your gracious Majesty, seeing that he has done more to beautify the town than all the rest.  It has also been given out that the town has to be honoured by a royal visit from your Majesty's grandson, Prince George. But pray take a fool's advice, your Majesty, and don't let him come unless he is able to pay his own expenses; for I can assure His Royal Highness that this is the city of number oneism.  Yet with the exception of parting with the bawbees, I dare be sworn that your Majesty's subjects in Keighley are the grand and genuine men of the shire, take them in art and science, flood or field. "

563,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Dame Europe kept a Lodging-House, And she was fond of brass; She took in public lodgers, Of every rank and class. "
564,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"She'd French and German, Dutch and Swiss, And other nations too; So poor old Mrs. Europe Had lots of work to do. "
565,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"I cannot just now name her beds, Her number being so large; But five she kept for deputies, Which she had in her charge. "
566,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"So in this famous Lodging-House, John Bull he stood A1; On him she always kept an eye, To see things rightly done. "
567,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"And Master Louis was her next, And second, there's no doubt, For when a little row took place, He always backed John out. "
568,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"And in her house was Alex. Russ; Oft him they eyed with fear; For Alex. was a lazy hound, And kept a Russian Bear. "
569,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Her fourth was a man of grace, Who was for heaven bent; His name was Pious William, He read his Testament. "
570,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Her fifth, too, was a pious Knave, And 'tis our firm belief, He once did rob the Hungary Lads Of hard-earned bread and beef. "
571,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"These were Dame Europe's deputies, In whom she put her trust, To keep her Lodging-House at peace, In case eruption burst. "
572,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"For many a time a row took place, While sharing out the scran; But John and Louis soon stepp'd in, And cleared the _padding can_. "
573,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Once, Alex. Russ's father, Nick, A bit before he died, Did roughly seize a little Turk, And thought to warm his hide. "
574,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"But John and Louis interfered, Declaring it foul play; And made old Nick remember it Until his dying day. "
575,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Now all Dame Europe's deputies, They made themselves at home; And every lodger knew his bed, Likewise his sitting room. "
576,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"They took great interest in their beds, And kept them very clean; Unlike some other _padding cans_, So dirty and so mean. "
577,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"The best and choicest bed of all, Was occupied by Johnny; Because the Dame did favour him, He did collect her money. "
578,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"And in a little bunk he lived, Seal'd up with oak, and tarr'd; He would not let a single one Come near within a yard. "
579,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"A Jack-of-all-trades, too, was John, And aught he'd do for brass; And what he ever took in hand, No one could him surpass. "
580,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"When tired of being shut in the bunk, Sometimes he went across, To spend an hour with Master Loo, And they the wine would toss. "
581,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"So many a happy day they spent, These lads, with one another; While every lodger in the house, Thought John was Louis' brother. "
582,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"The Dame allowed John something nice, To get well in her rent, Which every now and then i' t'bank, He put it on per cent. "
583,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"And working very hard himself Amongst his tar and pitch; He soon accumulated wealth, That made him very rich. "
584,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Now Louis had a pleasant crib Which was admired by lots, And being close by a window, He had some flower pots. "
585,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"The next to Louis' bed was Will, The biggest Monitor And though he did pretend a saint, He was as big a cur. "
586,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"He loved to make them all believe He was opposed to strife, And said he never caused a row, No, never in his life. "
587,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"He was so fond of singing psalms, And he read his testament; That everybody was deceived When he was mischief bent. "
588,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"He seldom passed a lodger's bed But what he took a glance, Which made them every one suspect He'd rob if he'd a chance. "
589,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Now Louis had two flower pots He nourished with much care, But little knew that Willie's eyes Were set upon the pair. "
590,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"In one there grew an ALSACE ROSE, The other a LORRAINE, And Willie vowed they once were his And must be his again. "
591,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"He said his father once lodged there, And that the Dame did know That Louis' predecessors once Had sneaked them in a row. "
592,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"In Willie's council was a lad Well up to every quirk; To keep him out of mischief long, Dame Europe had her work. "
593,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"To this smart youth Saint Willie Did whisper his desire, One night as they sat smoking, Besides the kitchen fire-- "
594,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""To get them flowers back again,"" Said Bissy, very low, ""Meet Louis somewhere on the quiet, And try to cause a row. "
595,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""But mind the other deputies Don't catch you on the hop, For John and Joseph you must know Your little game would stop. "
596,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""For Joseph he has not forgot The day you warmed his rig; And christian Denmark still thinks on About his nice Slesvig."" "
597,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""By your advice, my own Dear Mark, I have been guided on, But what about that man i't'bunk?"" (Pointing o'er to John.) "
598,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""He's very plucky too is John, But yet he's very slow, And perhaps he never may perceive Our scheme about the row. "
599,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""But not another word of this To anybody's ears, The Dame she plays the list'ner, I have my doubts and fears. "
600,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""So let us go upstairs at once, I think it will be best, And let us pray to Him above, Before we go to rest."" "
601,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"So with a pious countenance, His prayers as usual said, But squinting round the room the while, He spied an empty bed. "
602,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""What a pity that these empty stocks Should be unoccupied; Do you think my little cousin, Mark, To them could be denied?"" "
603,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""'Tis just the very thing,"" said Mark, ""Your cousin, sir, and you, Would carry out my scheme first-rate, One at each side of Loo."" "
604,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"The Dame being asked, did not object, If he could pay the rent, And had a decent character, And Louis would consent. "
605,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""But I do object to this,"" says Loo, ""And on this very ground, Willie and his cousins, ma'am, They soon would me surround. "
606,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""They're nothing in my line at all They are so near a-kin, And so if I consent to this, At once they'll hem me in."" "
607,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Oh! you couldn't think it, Master Loo, That I should do you harm, For don't I read my testament And don't I sing my psalm."" "
608,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""'Tis all my eye,"" said Louis, ""both Your testament and psalms; You use the dumbbells regular To strengthen up your arms. "
609,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""So take your poor relation off, You pious-looking prig, And open out Kit Denmark's box, And give him back Slesvig."" "
610,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Come, come,"" says Mrs. Europe, ""Let's have no bother here, You're trying now to breed a row, At least it does appear."" "
611,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Now Johnny hearing from the bunk What both of them did say, He shouted out, ""Now stop it, Will, Or else you'll rue the day."" "
612,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""All right, friend John, I'm much obliged, You are my friend, I know, And so my little cousin, sir, I'm willing to withdraw."" "
613,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"But Louis frothed at mouth with rage, Like one that was insane, And said he'd make Bill promise him He'd not offend again. "
614,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""I'd promise no such thing,"" says Mark, ""For that would hurt your pride, Sing on and read your testament, Dame Europe's on your side."" "
615,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""If I'd to promise aught like that, 'Twould be against my mind; So take it right or take it wrong, I'll promise naught o' t'kind."" "
616,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Then I shall take and wallop thee Unless thou cuts thy stick; And drive thee to thy fatherland Before another week."" "
617,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Come on,"" cried Sanctimonius, And sending out his arm He caught poor Louis on the nose, Then sung another psalm. "
618,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"But Louis soon was on his pins, And used his fists a bit, But he was fairly out of breath, And seldom ever hit. "
619,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"And at the end of round the first, He got it fearful hot, This was his baptism of fire If we mistake it not. "
620,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"So Willie sent a letter home To mother old Augusta, Telling her he'd thrashed poor Loo, And given him such a duster. "
621,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""What wonderful events,"" says he, ""Has heaven brought about, I'll fight the greatest pugilist That ever was brought out. "
622,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"And if by divine Providence I get safe through this row, Then I will sing 'My God, the spring From whom all blessings flow.'"" "
623,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Meanwhile the other Monitors, Were standing looking on, But none of them dare speak a word, But all stared straight at John. "
624,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Ought not I to interfere?"" Says Johnny to the rest; But he was told by every one Neutrality was best. "
625,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Neutral,"" growl'd John, ""I hate the word, 'Tis poison to my ear; It's another word for cowardice, And makes me fit to swear. "
626,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""At any rate I can do this, My mind I will not mask, I'll give poor Loo a little drop Out of my brandy flask. "
627,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""And give it up, poor Loo, my lad, You might as well give in, You know that I have got no power; Besides, you did begin."" "
628,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Then Louis rose, and looked at John, And spoke of days gone by When he would not have seen his friend Have blackened Johnny's eye. "
629,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""And as for giving in, friend John, I'll do nothing of the sort; Do you think I'll be a laughing-stock For everybody's sport."" "
630,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"This conversation that took place Made pious Willie grin, And tell John Bull to hold his noise, 'Twas nought to do with him. "
631,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"These words to John did make him stare, And finding to his shame, That those were worse who did look on, Than those who played the game. "
632,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Now Mrs. Europe knew the facts Which had been going on, And with her usual dignity, These words addressed to John: "
633,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Now, Mr. Bull, pray answer me,-- Why are you gaping here? You are my famous deputy, Then why not interfere?"" "
634,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Why,"" answered John, and made a bow, But yet was very shy, ""I was told to be a neutral, ma'am, And that's the reason why."" "
635,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""That's just what you should not have done, Being in authority; Did I not place you in that bunk To think and act for me? "
636,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Why any baby in the house Could not have done much worse, But I fancy you've been holding back To save your private purse. "
637,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Neutrality is as fine a word As ever a coward used, The honour that I gave to you You shouldn't have abused."" "
638,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"The minor lodgers in the house, On hearing this, to John, Began to whisper and to laugh, And call'd it famous fun. "
639,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"At last a little urchin said, ""Please ma'am I'd take my oath, 'At master John was neutral, And stuck up for them both."" "
640,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Stuck up for both, offended both,-- Yes that is what you mean?"" Continued Madame Europe, Then spoke to John again: "
641,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Now I'll tell you what it is, John, We've long watch'd your career, You take your fags' advice to save Your paltry sums a year. "
642,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""There's Bob and Bill, besides some more, That I call naught but scums, They've got you fairly in between Their fingers and their thumbs. "
643,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""If such like men as Ben and Hugh This day your fags had been, They would have saved both you and me This curs'd disgraceful scene. "
644,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Instead of bein' half-clad and shod, As everybody knows, You would have dared these rivals now To come to such like blows. "
645,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""There was a time in this house, John, If you put up your thumb, The greatest blackguard tongue would stop As if they had been dumb. "
646,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""But not a one in this here house This moment cares a fig For all you say or all you do, Although your purse be big."" "
647,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""I couldn't hurt poor Louis, ma'am, Although he did begin; And then you see that Will and I Are very near akin. "
648,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Beside, you see,"" said John again, ""I let poor Louis sup; On both I use my ointment, and Their wounds I did bind up. "
649,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Ah! weel a day,"" then said the Dame, But was affected sore, ""I see you have some small excuse That you have done it for. "
650,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""I have some little hopes left yet That you may yet have sense, To know your high position, John, Instead of saving pence. "
651,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""You yet will learn that duty, sir, Cannot be ignored, However disagreeable when Placed before the board. "
652,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""And let me tell you he who shirks The responsibility Of seeing right, is doing wrong, And earns humility. "
653,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""And 'tis an empty-headed dream, To boast of skill and power, But dare not even interfere At this important hour. "
654,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""Better far confess at once You're not fit for your place, Than have a name 'Heroic,' sir, Branded with disgrace. "
655,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""But I'll not say another word; My deputies, to you; But hope you will a warning take, This moment from poor Loo. "
656,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"""And hoping, John, your enemies May never have the chance To see you paid for watching Will Thrash poor weak Louis France."" "
659,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"On Aire's bonny benks wi' her meadows so green, There's an ancient owd hall to-day may be seen, That wor built in the days of some owd feudal king, Of whom the owd bards delighted to sing. Tho' its splendour's now faded, its greatness was then Known to its foemen as Red Lion's den; 'Neath its armorial shield, an' hoary owd wall, I now see Rebecca o' Riddlesden Hall. "
660,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Her majestic black eyes true beauty display, Resemblin' truly the goddess of day; Her dark-flowin' ringlets, you'd think as they shone, 'At Venus hed fashion'd 'em after her awn. For her tresses no ribbons nor trappins do bind, But wantonly luxurious flow in the wind: 'Twod o' pleased the great Reubens or Turner to call, To see sweet Rebecca o' Riddlesden Hall. "
661,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Like the tall mountain fir, she's as steady, I trow, When zephyr-like winds do sighingly blow; The grove or the grotto when mild breezes move, Are gentle Rebecca's sweet gales of love. Her breath, where true wit so gracefully flows, Has the beautiful scent of the pink an' the rose; There's no nymph from the East to Niagara's Fall, To equal Rebecca o' Riddlesden Hall. "
662,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Her toe points the grahnd wi' sich beauty an' grace, Nor varies a hair's-breadth, sud yu measure her pace: An' when dress'd i' her gingham wi' white spots an' blue, O then is Rebecca so pleasin' to view. Wi' her gray Wolsey stockings by hersel knit an' spun, An' a nice little apron, hieroglyphic'ly done: It needs no rich velvets or Cashmere shawl, To deck out Rebecca o' Riddlesden Hall. "
663,A BURLESQUE ON THE FRANCO-PRUSSIAN WAR.,"Love, grace, an' beauty attend at her will; She wounds wi' a look, wi' a frown she can kill; The youths as they pass her, exclaim--""Woe is me!"" Who sees her must love her, who loves her must dee. At Church on a Sabbath, owd men raise ther arms, An' cry, ""O, great heavens! wor ivver sich charms?"" While matrons an' maidens God's blessin' they call, On the head of Rebecca o' Riddlesden Hall. "
666,(A DREAM).,"[It is said that when Giles Clumps, the South-downer, first came to Keighley, the first question he asked his fellow labourer was this, ""What religion be th' master here?""  ""A Liberal,"" was the answer; ""So be I,"" says Giles.  ""And what politics be th' master?"" asked Giles again, ""He's a Methody,"" was the reply; ""So be I,"" says Giles again, ""I be a Methody too.""  Now do not imagine for a moment that Giles Clumps is the only ""So be I"" in Keighley, for the whole town is full of ""So be I's,"" and it is a well-known fact that if six long YELLOW chimneys were to turn BLUE to-morrow, there wouldn't be a Liberal in six hours in the city of ""So be I's,"" with the exception of the old veteran SQUIRE LEACH.] "
667,(A DREAM).,"Oh list to my dream, nor yet think it wrong, If I tell it in rhyme, or sing it in song; For when I look back on the sights that were there, I could almost, like Blondin, dance high in the air. "
668,(A DREAM).,"For when I reflect, my heart leaps with joy-- What I saw in my dream in old ""So be I,"" For thousands were shouting on that pleasant day. We are all ""So be I's,"" hip, hip, hip hurrah! "
669,(A DREAM).,"And I took the first chance to ask what it meant, Of the people who shouted, what was their intent, When an elderly lady soon gave me the cue, Of what was the matter and what was to do. "
670,(A DREAM).,"Six great millocrats, call them Whigs if you will, The gods of our labour in workshop and mill: Have all turned their colours from Yellow to Blue, Which has caused this commotion the city all through. "
671,(A DREAM).,"Led on by the nose, like a bull in a band, See how all the ""So be I's"" follow so grand, The fag and the artist, the plebian also, Have now chang'd their colour from yellow to blue. "
672,(A DREAM).,"There's twenty-eight thousand true ""So be I's"" here, And there's not a Liberal amongst them I'll swear, For the millocrats chieftains proclaimed it they say, That all must turn Tories on this very day. "
673,(A DREAM).,"So upon the procession, I did my eyes fix, Reviewing and skewing this wonderful six; They wore blue ribands so grand in their coats, Singing ""So be I"" joskins come give us your votes. "
674,(A DREAM).,"The ""So be I's"" exerted each nerve and limb, To follow their leaders and join in the swim; And I plainly could see, so I thought in my dream, That the way through the world is to follow the stream. "
675,(A DREAM).,"For the faces of parsons were lit up so bright, And the doctors they smiled with the greatest delight; And a lawyer he vowed that he'd have a Blue gown, For he'd been long enough a black Liberal clown. "
676,(A DREAM).,"Methought the Ranters, and Methodies too, Independents and Quakers, and Baptists, were blue; And as I looked round me, lo! what did I see, A batch of Teetotallers had got on the spree. "
677,(A DREAM).,"But what I considered the best of the sport, Took place in front of the old County Court; The Mayor and Ex-Mayor were dancing a jig, With the County Court Judge in his gown and his wig. "
678,(A DREAM).,"Methought that the Draper and Hatter filed in, Along with the Grocer, his nearest of kin; And I caught the Co-oper just in the neck, In his hand were his divi. and new silver check. "
679,(A DREAM).,"Methought as I walked I sprang up so high, That I really found out I was able to fly; So backwards and forwards methought that I flew, To the clubs of the town which I found were all Blue. "
680,(A DREAM).,"Till somehow or other, I got quite astray, And over Cliffe Castle I winged my way, Thinks I, there's some Foreign ""So be I"" geese Have crossed o'er the Channel from Paris or Nice. "
681,(A DREAM).,"From thence I took wing, as blithe as a lark, And crossed o'er the town to Jim Collingham's Park; But ere I arrived at the end of my route, A lightning conductor caught the tail of my coat. "
682,(A DREAM).,"I hung there suspended high up in the air, Looking down on the mob in the wildest despair, Imploring the ""So be I's"" to get me relief; But they shouted ""Stop there, you Liberal thief!"" "
683,(A DREAM).,"I called on the de'il and invoked the skies, To curse and set fire to all ""So be I's;"" When all of a sudden I scratched at my head, Awoke from my dream--found myself snug in bed. "
686,(A DREAM).,"My poor owd lass, an art ta goan, To thy long rest? An' mun the cruel cold grave-stone Close ower thy breast? An' art ta goan no more to see, Exceptin' i' fond memory? Yes, empty echo answers me-- ""Shoe's deead an' goan!"" "
687,(A DREAM).,"I' vain the wafters o' the breeze Fan my hot brah, I' vain the birds upon the trees, Sing sweetly nah; I' vain the early rose-bud blaws, I' vain wide Nature shows her cause, Deeath thunders fro his greedy jaws-- ""Shoe's deead an' goan!"" "
688,(A DREAM).,"There's more ner me 'at's sad bereft, I pity wun, An' that's my lad--he's sadly left-- My little John; He wander's up an' dahn all t'day, An' rarely hez a word to say, Save murmuring (an' weel he may), ""Shoo's deead an goan!"" "
689,(A DREAM).,"Bud, Johnny lad, let's dry wer tears; At t'least we'll try; Thy mother's safe wi' Him 'at hears T'poor orphan's sigh; Fer 'tis the lot o' t'human mack-- An' who can tell which next he'll tack? An' crying cannot bring her back; ""Shoe's deead an' goan!"" "
692,(A DREAM).,"Wee silvery fish, who nobly braves The dangers o' the ocean waves While monsters from the unknown caves Make thee their prey; Escaping which the human knaves On thee lig way. "
693,(A DREAM).,"No doubt thou was at first designed To suit the palates o' mankind; Yet as I ponder now I find, Thy fame is gone: Wee dainty dish thou art behind With every one. "
694,(A DREAM).,"I've seen the time thy silvery sheen Wor welcome both at morn an' e'en, Or any hour that's in between, Thy name wor good; But now by some considered mean For human food. "
695,(A DREAM).,"When peace and plenty's smiling brow, And trade and commerce speed the plough; Thy friends that were not long ago, Such game they make; Thy epitaph is ""soldier"" now, Or ""two-eyed stake."" "
696,(A DREAM).,"When times are hard we're scant o' cash, And famine hungry bellies lash, And tripe and trollabobble's trash Begin to fail, Asteead o' soups an' oxtail ash, Hail! herring, hail! "
697,(A DREAM).,"Full monny a time it's made me groan, To see thee stretched, despised, alone; While turned-up noses passed have gone, O' purse-proud men! No friends, alas! save some poor one Fra t'paddin can. "
698,(A DREAM).,"Whoe'er despise thee, let them know The time may come when they may go To some fish wife, and beg to know If they can buy The friendship o' their vanquished foe, Wi' weeping eye. "
699,(A DREAM).,"To me naught could be better fun, Than see a duke or noble don, Or lord, or peer, or gentleman, In search o' thee: And they were bidden to move on, Or go to t'sea. "
700,(A DREAM).,"Yet we'll sing thy praise, wee fish; To me thou art a dainty dish; For thee, 'tis true, I often wish. My little bloater; Either salted, cured, or shining fresh Fra yon great water. "
701,(A DREAM).,"If through thy pedigree we peep, Philosophy from thee can keep, An' I need not study deep, There's nothing foreign; For I, like thee, am sold too cheap, My little herring. "

711,(A DREAM).,"Most respectfully dedicated to the Rev. F. D. CREMER, St. ANDREW'S, Keighley, Oct. 25th, 1889. "
712,(A DREAM).,"Dear reverend sir, excuse your humble servant, Whose heart you've made this very night to glow; I thank you kindly, and my prayers most fervent Will ever be, dear reverend sir, for you. "
713,(A DREAM).,"My ideas lacked for want of information, And glad am I to glean a little more, About the Churches of our mighty nation, Whose chimes are heard on many a far-off shore. "
714,(A DREAM).,"My heart was moved, for I was much astounded, To view the many Churches of our land; The life-like pictures of the saints who founded These ruins old, so wonderful and grand. "
715,(A DREAM).,"For oft I've wished, and often have I pondered, And longed to learn the history of our kirk; How it was handed down to us I've wondered, And who were they that did this mighty work. "
716,(A DREAM).,"The veil's removed, and now my sight is clearer, Upon the sacred history of our isle; For while I view these scenes it brings me nearer Unto the Church on which the angels smile. "
717,(A DREAM).,"Who would not shuffle off his worldly pleasures, For one short hour to bring before his sight, The pictures of the great and mighty treasures-- Our English Church, which brought the world to light. "
718,(A DREAM).,"Great Men dive deep down into wisdom's river-- The poet, philosopher, and sage-- For wisdom's pearls, which showeth forth for ever, Nor waste their sweetness or grow dull with age. "
719,(A DREAM).,"Who would not walk through ruins old and hoary, And make each relic and persue his search? Who would not listen and applaud each story, Told of an ancient good and English Church? "
720,(A DREAM).,"Each view so grand, mixed up with sacred singing, Of that old Church--I humbly call it mine, For still my heart to it is ever clinging, And He who died for me in ancient Palestine. "
724,(A DREAM).,"Lines written on the occasion of a Banquet given by His Worship the Mayor (Ald. ICKRINGILL), March 28th, 1891. "
725,(A DREAM).,"Come hither my muse and give me a start, And let me give praise to the one famous art; For it's not an M.P. or a Mayor that I toast, But the ancient Wool-comber, the Knight of the post. "
726,(A DREAM).,"In the brave days of old when I was a boy, I went to the Comb Shop, my heart full of joy; Where I listened to stories and legends of old, Which to me were more precious than silver or gold. "
727,(A DREAM).,"The old Comber would tell of his travels through life, And where he had met with his darling old wife; And how he had stole her from her native vale, To help him to pull the ""old tup"" by the ""tail."" "
728,(A DREAM).,"He would go through the tales of his youthful career, An undaunted youth without dread or fear; He knew all the natives, the rich and the poor, He knew every acre of mountain and moor. "
729,(A DREAM).,"He could make a sad tale of the wrongs of the State, And tell where old England would be soon or late; How nations would rise, and monarch's would fall, And tyrants would tremble and go to the wall. "
730,(A DREAM).,"He was very well read, though papers were dear, But he got _Reynold's_ newspaper year after year; It was bound to his bosom and he read it so keen, While at times he fair hated a King or a Queen. "
731,(A DREAM).,"He was fairly dramatic, the stage he loved well, The names of great actors and plays he would tell; And if that his notion it took the other way, He could quote the Bible a night and a day. "
732,(A DREAM).,"Full of wit, full of mirth, he could give you a sting, He could preach, he could pray, he could dance, he could sing; He could play pitch and toss, he could jump, he could run, He could shuffle the cards, he could handle a gun. "
733,(A DREAM).,"The old Constable knew him but let him alone, Because he knew better than bother with ""Joan""; For the lads of the Barracks and the Pinfold as well Would all have been there at the sound of the bell. "
734,(A DREAM).,"Old Keighley was then but a very small town, Yet she'd twelve hundred Combers that were very well known; Hundreds have gone over the dark flowing burn, Whence no traveller was ever yet known to return. "
735,(A DREAM).,It reminds me again of the Donkey and pack Which came from the hills bringing Wool on its back; And if the poor beast perchance had to bray 'Twere a true sign a Comber would die on that day. 
736,(A DREAM).,"The third day of the week, sometimes further on, The old woman would seek the King's Arms for her son; And if she were told he had not been at all, Would bounce over the green to the Hole-in-the-Wall. "
737,(A DREAM).,"Hi! those were fine times, especially the fairs, When the Inns were kept open for dancing upstairs; The Commercial, Lord Rodney, as well as the Crown To the ancient Wool-comber were fairly well known. "
738,(A DREAM).,"But now we'll get back to the pot and the pad, The fair it is over, the women are glad; For now the Wool-comber his follies he sees, And makes resolutions as staunch as you please. "
739,(A DREAM).,"For now he commences to work hard and late, He is building a Castle on a phantom estate; And he toils for a time but long hoggs make him sick, Then he duffs, and his castle falls down, every brick. "
740,(A DREAM).,"When Winter comes in with its keen bitter blast, And the poor rustic hind has to cope with the frost; Yet the Comber was happy in village and town, Though he knew that his calling was fast going down. "
741,(A DREAM).,"Oh yes, it was vanquished, the once noble art, For science had bid it for ever depart; Yet for thee old Comber fresh fields have arose, That have found thee in victuals, in fuel, and clothes. "
742,(A DREAM).,"So many brave thanks to the Mayor of the town Who has made the Wool-comber once more to be known; Let us drink to the health of our worthy host, The friend of the Comber, the Knight of the post. "
744,(A DREAM).,"In a little cot so dreary, With eyes and forehead hot and bleary, Sat a mother sad and weary, With her darling on her knee; Their humble fare at best was sparing For the father he was shearing, With his three brave sons of Erin, All down in the Fen countree. "
745,(A DREAM).,"All her Saxon neighbours leave her, With her boy and demon fever, The midnight watch--none to relieve her, Save a little Busy Bee: He was called the Harem-Skarem, Noisy as a drum-clock larum, Yet his treasures he would share 'em, With his friend right merrily. "
746,(A DREAM).,"Every night and every morning, With the day sometimes at dawning-- While lay mother, sick and swooning-- To his dying mate went he: Robbing his good Saxon mother, Giving to his Celtic brother, Who asked for him and no other, Until his spirit it was free. "
747,(A DREAM).,"Saw the shroud and saw the coffin; Brought the pipes and brought the snuff in; This little noble-hearted ruffian, To the wake each night went he: Sabbath morning he was ready, Warn'd the bearers to be steady, Taking Peter to his beddy, And a tear stood in his e'e. "
748,(A DREAM).,"Onward as the corpse was passing, Ere the priest gave his last blessing, Through the dingy crowd came pressing, The father and the brothers three; 'Tis our mother--we will greet her; How is this that here we meet her? And without our little Peter, Who will solve this mystery? "
749,(A DREAM).,"The Harem-Skarem interfered, ""Soon this corpse will be interred, Come with us and see it buried, Out in yonder cemet'ry:"" Soon they knew the worst and pondered Half-amazed and half-dumbfounded;-- And returning home, they wondered Who their little friend could be! "
750,(A DREAM).,"Turning round to him they bowed, Much they thanked him, much they owed; While the tears each cheek bedewed, Wish'd him all prosperity: ""Never mind,"" he said, ""my brothers, What I've done, do ye to others; We're all poor barns o' some poor mothers,"" Said the little Busy Bee. "
752,(A DREAM).,"[T'West Riding o' Yorkshire is famed for different branches i' t'fine art line, bud t'music aw think licks t'lump, especially abaght Haworth an' Keighley.  Nah Haworth wunce hed a famous singer; he wor considered one o' t'best i' Yorkshire in his time.  It is said 'at he once walked fra Haworth to York i' one day, an' sung at an Oratorio at neet.  He hed one fault, an' that wor just same as all t'other Haworth celebrities; he wod talk owd fashioned, an' that willant dew up i' London.  Bud we hed monny a good singer beside him i' t'neighbourhood.  Nah what is thur grander ner a lot o' local singers at Kersmas time chanting i' t'streets; it's ommost like bein' i' heaven, especially when you're warm i' bed.  But there's another thing at's varry amusing abaght our local singers, when they meet together ther is some demi-semi-quavering, when ther's sharps, flats, an' naturals;--an' t'best ale an' crotchets mix'd, that's the time fer music.] "
753,(A DREAM).,"Come, gi' us a wag o' thy paw, Jim Wreet, Come, gi' us a wag o' thy paw; I knew thee when thy heead wor black, Bud nah it's white as snow; A Merry Kersmas to thee, Jim, An' all thy kith an' kin; An' hoping tha'll ha' monny more, For t'sake o' ould long sin'-- Jim Wreet, For t'sake o' ould long sin'. "
754,(A DREAM).,"It's so monny year to-day, Jim Wreet, Sin owd Joe Constantine-- An' Daniel Acroyd, thee, an' me, An other friends o' thine, Went up ta sing at Squire's house, Not a hauf-a-mile fra here; An' t'Squire made us welcome To his brown October beer-- Jim Wreet, To his brown October beer. "
755,(A DREAM).,"An' owd Joe Booth tha knew, Jim Wreet, 'At kept the Old King's Arms; Whear all t'church singers used ta meet, When they hed sung ther Psalms; An' thee an' me amang 'em, Jim, Sometimes hev chang'd the string, An' with a merry chorus join'd, We've made yon tavern ring, Jim Wreet, We've made yon tavern ring. "
756,(A DREAM).,"But nearly three score years, Jim Wreet, Hev past away sin' then; Then Keighley in Appolo's Art, Could boast her trusty men; But music nah means money, Jim, An' that tha's sense to knaw; But just fer owd acquaintance sake. Come gi' us a wag o' thy paw, Jim Wreet, Come gi' us a wag o' thy paw. "
758,(A DREAM).,"Sweet sing the birds in lowly strain, All mingled in their song; For lovely Spring is here again, And Winter's cold is gone. "
759,(A DREAM).,"All things around seem filled with glee, And joy swells every breast; The buds are peeping from each bush, Where soon the birds will rest. "
760,(A DREAM).,"The meadows now are fresh and green, The flowers are bursting forth, And nature seems to us serene, And shows her sterling worth. "
761,(A DREAM).,"The lark soars high up in the air, We listen to his lays; He knows no sorrow, no, nor care, Nor weariness o' days. "
762,(A DREAM).,"But man, though born of noble birth, Assigned for higher spheres, Walks his sad journey here on earth All full o' doubts and fears. "
765,(A DREAM).,"Behold how the rivers flow down to the sea, Sending their treasures so careless and free; And to give their assistance each Spring doth arise, Uplifting and singing my songs to the skies. "
766,(A DREAM).,"Find out the haunts o' the low human pest, Give to the weary, the poor, and distress'd; What if ungrateful and thankless they be, Think of the giver that gave unto thee. "
767,(A DREAM).,"Go travel the long lanes on misery's verge, Find out their dark dens, and list to their dirge; Where want and famine, and by ourselves made, Forgive our frail follies, and come to our aid. "
768,(A DREAM).,"Give to yon widow--thy gift is thrice blest, For tho' she be silent, the harder she's press'd; A small bit o' help to the little she earns, God blesses the giver to fatherless bairns. "
769,(A DREAM).,"'Neath the green grassy mounds i' yon little church-yard An over-wrought genius there finds his reward; And marvel thee not, when I say unto thee, Such are the givers that give unto me. "
770,(A DREAM).,"Then scatter thy mite like nature her rain,-- What if no birdie should chant thee a strain; What if no daisy should smile on the lea; The sweet honeysuckle will compensate thee. "
771,(A DREAM).,"For the day will soon come, if thou gives all thou may, That thou mayest venture to give all away; Ere Nature again her balmy dews send, Thou may have vanished my good giving friend. "
773,(A DREAM).,"They are up in the morning right early, They are up sometimes afore leet; I hear their clogs they are clamping, As t'little things go dahn the street. "
774,(A DREAM).,"They are off in the morning right early, With their baskets o' jock on their arm; The bell is ting-tonging, ting-tonging, As they enter the mill in a swarm. "
775,(A DREAM).,"They are kapering backward and forward, Their ends to keep up if they can; They are doing their utmost endeavours, For fear o' the frown o' man. "
776,(A DREAM).,"Wi' fingers so nimble and supple, They twist, an' they twine, an' they twirl, Such walking, an' running, an' kneeling, Does the wee little factory girl. "
777,(A DREAM).,"They are bouncing about like a shuttle, They are kneeling an' rubbing the floor; While their wee little mates they are doffing, Preparing the spindles for more. "
778,(A DREAM).,"Them two little things they are t'thickest, They help one another 'tis plain; They try to be t'best and t'quickest, The smiles o' their master to gain. "
779,(A DREAM).,"And now from her ten hours' labour, Back to her cottage shoo shogs; Aw hear by the tramping an' singing, 'Tis the factory girl in her clogs. "
780,(A DREAM).,"And at night when shoo's folded i' slumber, Shoo's dreaming o' noises and drawls: Of all human toil under-rated, 'Tis our poor little factory girl's. "
782,(A DREAM).,"Says a wag to a porter i' Haworth one day, ""Yahr not ower sharp ye drones o't'railway, For fra Keighley to Haworth I've been oft enough, But nivver a hawpenny I've paid ye begoff."" "
783,(A DREAM).,"The porter replied, ""I vary mitch daht it, But I'll give a quart to hear all about it; For it looks plain to me tha cuddant pass t'snicket, Baht tipping to t'porter thy pass or thy ticket."" "
784,(A DREAM).,"""Tha'll write up to Derby an' then tha'll deceive me""; ""I willn't, this time,"" sed t'porter, ""believe me"": ""Then aght wi thy brass, an' let us be knocking, For I've walk'd it on foot, by t'Cross Roads an' t' Bocking."" "
786,(A DREAM).,"Dear Harden, the home o' my boyhood so dear, Thy wanderin' son sall thee ivver revere; Tho' years hev rolled ower sin thy village I left, An' o' frends an' relations I now am bereft. "
787,(A DREAM).,"Yet thy hills they are pleasant, tho' rocky an' bare; Thy dowters are handsome, thy sons they are rare; When I walk thro' thy dells, by the clear running streams, I think o' my boyhood an' innocent dreams. "
788,(A DREAM).,"No care o' this life then troubled my breast, I wor like a young bird new fligged fra its nest; Wi' my dear little mates did I frolic and play, Wal life's sweetest moments wor flying away. "
789,(A DREAM).,"As the dew kissed the daisies their portals to close, At neet i' my bed I did sweetly repose; An' rose in the morning at Nature's command, Till fra boyhood to manhood my frame did expand. "
790,(A DREAM).,"The faces that once were familiar to me, Those that did laugh at my innocent glee; I fancy I see them, tho' now far away, Or p'r'aps i' Bingley church-yard they may lay. "
791,(A DREAM).,"For since I've embarked on life's stormy seas, My mind's like the billows that's nivver at ease; Yet I still hev a hope my last moments to crown-- In thee, dearest village, to lay myself down. "
793,(A DREAM).,"[This extraordinary ""hero"" either bore false witness against his neighbour, a poor artisan, or (taking his own word for it) saved the nation from great disaster and ruin by putting out a fire that no one saw but himself.] "
794,(A DREAM).,"We've heard of great fires in city and town, And many disasters by fire are known; But surely this fire which I'm going to tell, Was worse than Mount Etna, Vesuvius, or hell; For the great prophecy it no doubt would fulfil, But for _t'heroic_ watchman at Calversyke Hill. "
795,(A DREAM).,"This fire broke out in the night it was said, While peaceful each villager slept in his bed; And so greatly the flames did light up the skies, That it took the big watchman all in surprise, Yet great was the courage and undaunted the skill Of the _heroic_ watchman of Calversyke Hill. "
796,(A DREAM).,"He swore by his Maker, the flames rose so high, That within a few yards, they reached to the sky; And so greatly they lighted up mountains and dales, He could see into Ireland, Scotland and Wales! And so easily the beaks did swallow his pill, They fined the poor artist of Calversyke Hill. "
797,(A DREAM).,"Now, there's some foolish people are led to suppose, It was by some shavings this fire first arose; But yet says our hero, ""I greatly suspect, This fire was caused by the grossest neglect; But I'm glad its put out, let it be as it will,"" Says the _heroic_ watchman of Calversyke Hill. "
798,(A DREAM).,"He needed no witness to swear what he'd done, Yet if he had wanted he could have had one; For one Tommy Twister, that never was there, Saw the sparks from the chimney, as they flew in the air, The greatest sized coal-pot no doubt they would fill, Like the head of the _hero_ of Calversyke Hill. "
799,(A DREAM).,"So many brave thanks to this _heroic_ knave, For thousands of lives no doubt he did save, And but for this hero, disaster had spread, And smothered the nation while sleeping in bed; But to save all his people it was the Lord's will, Through the _heroic_ watchman at Calversyke Hill. "
800,(A DREAM).,"So mind and be careful and put out your lights, All ye with red noses in case they ignite, Or perhaps from your bed you may have to leap, In case this great watchman chances to sleep, For as rumours are spread, he is fond of his gill, Is the _heroic_ watchman of Calversyke Hill. "
802,(A DREAM).,"Lines written on the Keighley Cricket Club Bazaar of 1889, and most respectfully dedicated to the late William Luke Brown, Esq. "
803,(A DREAM).,"I sing not of grim-visaged war, Nor diplomatic rage, But I shall string my harp in praise Of the worthies of our age. "
804,(A DREAM).,"They are a class of noble men, Whom England holds most dear. Whose feats so grand adorn our land, Like the famous cricketeer? "
805,(A DREAM).,"The Ancient Greek his chariot ran, It was his Royal sport; The Roman gladiator fought To please the Royal Court. "
806,(A DREAM).,The Spaniard with his javelin knife The wild bull's flesh he tears; But alack a-day! what sports are they With our grand cricketeers. 
807,(A DREAM).,"And well old Keighley can be proud Of her famed sons to-day; Some of them are with us yet, While others are away. "
808,(A DREAM).,"Brave Brown! brave Foulds and Waring, With good men in the rear, And not forgetting Emmett, The brave old cricketeer. "
809,(A DREAM).,"Then while they have their Grand Bazaar, Pray let us rally round, And give a hand to renovate Their well-loved cricket ground. "
810,(A DREAM).,"For well I wot both young and old, Will find from year to year, More interest in the noble sport Of the grand old cricketeer. "
811,(A DREAM).,"The Mexican may throw his lance, The Scotchman put his stone, With all the scientific skill Of muscle and of bone. "
812,(A DREAM).,"Give Switzerland her honour'd place With rifles and with spears, But give to me our grand old sport, Our famous cricketeers. "
815,(A DREAM).,"Sweet lady, 'tis no troubadour, That sings so sweetly at your door, To tell you of the joys in store, So grand and gay; But one that sings ""Remember th' poor, 'Tis Christmas Day."" "
816,(A DREAM).,"Within some gloomy walls to-day Just cheer the locks of hoary gray, And try to smooth their rugged way With cheerful glow; And cheer the widow's heart, I pray, Crushed down with woe. "
817,(A DREAM).,"O make the weary spent-up glad, And cheer the orphan lass and lad; Make frailty's heart, so long, long sad, Your kindness feel; And make old crazy bones stark mad To dance a reel. "
818,(A DREAM).,"Then peace and plenty be your lot, And may your deed ne'er be forgot, That helps the widow in her cot, From out your store; Nor creed nor seed should matter not, The poor are poor. "
820,(A DREAM).,"The branches o' the woodbine hide My little cottage wall, An' though 'tis but a humble thatch, I envy not the hall. "
821,(A DREAM).,"The wooded hills before my eyes Are spread both far and wide; An' Nature's grandeur seems to dress, In all her lovely pride. "
822,(A DREAM).,"It is, indeed, a lovely spot, O' singing birds an' flowers; 'Mid Nature's grandeur it is true, I pass away my hours. "
823,(A DREAM).,"Yet think not 'tis this lovely glen, So dear in all its charms; Its blossomed banks and rippled reels, Freed from the world's alarms. "
824,(A DREAM).,"For should love's magic change the scene, To trackless lands unknown, 'Twere Eden in the desert wild, Wi' him I call my own. "
827,(A DREAM).,"Bright seem the days when I wor young Fra thought, and care, and sorrow free; As wild waves rippled i' the sun, Rolled gaily on, 'twor so wi' me. "
828,(A DREAM).,"More bright the flowers when I wor young, More sweet the birds sang on the tree; While pleasure and contentment flung Her smiles on them, and so wi' me. "
829,(A DREAM).,"The naked truth I told when young, Though tempted wi' hypocrisy; Though some embraced, from it I sprang, An' said it isn't so wi' me. "
830,(A DREAM).,"I saw the canting jibs when young, Of saintly, sulky misery; Yet poked I melancholy's ribs, And said it isn't so wi' me. "
831,(A DREAM).,"Though monny a stone when I wor young, Is strong upon my memory-- I threw when young an' hed 'em flung; If they forgive, 'tis so wi' me. "
832,(A DREAM).,"Could money buy o' Nature's mart, Again our brightest days to see; Ther's monny a wun wod pawn the shirt, Or else they'd buy--and so wi' me. "
833,(A DREAM).,"Yet after all I oft look back, Without a pang o' days gone past, An' hope all t'wrong I did when young, May be forgi'n to me at last. "
835,(A DREAM).,"Says Pug o' Joan's, o' Haworth Brah, To Rodge, o' Wickin Crag-- ""Ahr Nelly's tung's a yard too long, And by t'mess it can wag. "
836,(A DREAM).,"""It's hell at top o' t'earth wi' me, An' stand it I am forc'd; I'd give all t'brass 'at I possess, If I could get divorced."" "
837,(A DREAM).,"Then answered Rodge, ""I hev a dodge, As good a plan as any; A real divorce tha'll get of course-- It willn't cost a penny."" "
838,(A DREAM).,"""Then tell me what it is,"" says Pug, ""I'm almost brocken-hearted,"" ""Well, go to Keethlah Warkhase, lad, Where man an' wife are parted."" "
841,(A DREAM).,"Blest vision of departed worth, I see thee still, I see thee still; Thou art the shade of her that's gone, My Mary Hill, my Mary Hill. "
842,(A DREAM).,"My chamber in this silent hour, Were dark an' drear, were dark an' drear But brighter far than Cynthia's beam, Now thou art here, now thou art here. "
843,(A DREAM).,"Wild nature in her grandeur had No charm for me, no charm for me; Did not the songsters chant thy name From every tree, from every tree. "
844,(A DREAM).,"Chaos would have come again, In worlds afar, in worlds afar; Could I not see my Mary's face, In every star, in every star. "
845,(A DREAM).,"Say when the messenger o' death, Shall bid me come, shall bid me come; Wilt thou be foremost in the van, To take me home, to take me home. "
