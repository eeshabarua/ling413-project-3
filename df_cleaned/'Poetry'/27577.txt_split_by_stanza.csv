15,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"Of the seventy-three ""Epigrams and Jeux d'Esprit,"" which are printed at the commencement of this volume, forty-five were included in Murray's one-volume edition of 1837, eighteen have been collected from various publications, and ten are printed and published for the first time. "
16,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"The ""Devil's Drive,"" which appears in Moore's _Letters and Journals_, and in the sixth volume of the Collected Edition of 1831 as an ""Unfinished Fragment"" of ninety-seven lines, is now printed and published for the first time in its entirety (248 lines), from a MS. in the possession of the Earl of Ilchester. ""A Farewell Petition to J.C.H. Esq.;"" ""My Boy Hobbie O;"" ""[Love and Death];"" and ""Last Words on Greece,"" are reprinted from the first volume of _Murray's Magazine_ (1887). "
17,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"A few imperfect and worthless poems remain in MS.; but with these and one or two other unimportant exceptions, the present edition of the Poetical Works may be regarded as complete. "
18,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"In compiling a ""Bibliography of the successive Editions and Translations of Lord Byron's Poetical Works,"" I have endeavoured, in the first instance, to give a full and particular account of the collected editions and separate issues of the poems and dramas which were open to my inspection; and, secondly, to extract from general bibliographies, catalogues of public and private libraries, and other sources bibliographical records of editions which I have been unable to examine, and were known to me only at second-hand. It will be observed that the _title-pages_ of editions which have passed through my hands are aligned; the _titles_ of all other editions are italicized. "
19,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"I cannot pretend that this assortment of bibliographical entries is even approximately exhaustive; but as ""a sample"" of a bibliography it will, I trust, with all its imperfections, be of service to the student of literature, if not to the amateur or bibliophile. With regard to nomenclature and other technicalities, my aim has been to put the necessary information as clearly and as concisely as possible, rather than to comply with the requirements of this or that formula. But the path of the bibliographer is beset with difficulties. ""Al Sirat's arch""--""the bridge of breadth narrower than the thread of a famished spider, and sharper than the edge of a sword"" (see _The Giaour_, line 483, _note_ I)--affords an easier and a safer foothold. "
20,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"To the general reader a bibliography says little or nothing; but, in one respect, a bibliography of Byron is of popular import. It affords scientific proof of an almost unexampled fame, of a far-reaching and still potent influence. Teuton and Latin and Slav have taken Byron to themselves, and have made him their own. No other English poet except Shakespeare has been so widely read and so frequently translated. Of _Manfred_ I reckon one Bohemian translation, two Danish, two Dutch, three French, nine German, three Hungarian, three Italian, two Polish, one Romaic, one Roumanian, four Russian, and three Spanish translations, and, in all probability, there are others which have escaped my net. The question, the inevitable question, arises--What was, what is, the secret of Byron's Continental vogue? and why has his fame gone out into all lands? Why did Goethe enshrine him, in the second part of _Faust_, ""as the representative of the modern era ... undoubtedly to be regarded as the greatest genius of our century?"" (_Conversations of Goethe_, 1874, p. 265). "
21,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"It is said, and with truth, that Byron's revolutionary politics commended him to oppressed nationalities and their sympathizers; that he was against ""the tramplers""--Castlereagh, and the Duke of Wellington, and the Holy Alliance; that he stood for liberty. Another point in his favour was his freedom from cant, his indifference to the pieties and proprieties of the Britannic Muse; that he had the courage of his opinions. Doubtless in a time of trouble he was welcomed as the champion of revolt, but deeper reasons must be sought for an almost exclusive preference for the works of one poet and a comparative indifference to the works of his rivals and contemporaries. He fulfilled another, perhaps a greater ideal. An Englishman turns to poetry for the expression in beautiful words of his happier and better feelings, and he is not contented unless poetry tends to make him happier or better--happier because better than he would be otherwise. His favourite poems are psalms, or at least metrical paraphrases, of life. Men of other nations are less concerned about their feelings and their souls. They regard the poet as the creator, the inventor, the maker _par excellence_, and he who can imagine or make the greatest _eidolon_ is the greatest poet. _Childe Harold_ and _The Corsair_, _Mazeppa_ and _Manfred, Cain_ and _Sardanapalus_ were new creations, new types, forms more real than living man, which appealed to their artistic sense, and led their imaginations captive. ""It is a mark,"" says Goethe (_Aus meinem Leben: Dichtung und Wahreit_, 1876, iii. 125), ""of true poetry, that, as a secular gospel, it knows how to free us from the earthly burdens which press upon us, by inward serenity, by outward charm.... The most lively, as well as the gravest works have the same end--to moderate both pleasure and pain through a happy mental representation."" It is passion translated into action, the pageantry of history, the transfiguration into visible lineaments of living moods and breathing thoughts which are the notes of this ""secular gospel,"" and for one class of minds work out a secular redemption. "
22,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"It was not only the questionable belief that he was on the side of the people, or his ethical and theological audacities, or his prolonged Continental exile, which won for Byron a greater name abroad than he has retained at home; but the character of his poetry. ""The English may think of Byron as they please"" (_Conversations of Goethe_, 1874, p. 171), ""but this is certain, that they can show no poet who is to be compared to him. He is different from all the others, and, for the most part, greater."" The English may think of him as they please! and for them, or some of them, there is ""a better oenomel,"" a _vinum Dæmonum_, which Byron has not in his gift. The evidence of a world-wide fame will not endear a poet to a people and a generation who care less for the matter than the manner of verse, or who _believe_ in poetry as the symbol or ""_credo_"" of the imagination or the spirit; but it should arrest attention and invite inquiry. A bibliography is a dull epilogue to a poet's works, but it speaks with authority, and it speaks last. _Finis coronat opus!_ "
23,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"I must be permitted to renew my thanks to Mr. G.F. Barwick, _Superintendent of the Reading Room_, Mr. Cyril Davenport, and other officials of the British Museum, of all grades and classes, for their generous and courteous assistance in the preparation and completion of the Bibliography. The consultation of many hundreds of volumes of one author, and the permission to retain a vast number in daily use, have entailed exceptional labour on a section of the staff. I have every reason to be grateful. "
24,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"I am indebted to Mr. A.W. Pollard, of the British Museum, for advice and direction with regard to bibliographical formulas; to Mr. G.L. Calderon, late of the staff, for the collection and transcription of the title-pages of Polish, Russian, and Servian translations; and to Mr. R. Nisbet Bain for the supervision and correction of the proofs of Slavonic titles. "
25,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"To Mr. W.P. Courtney, the author of _Bibliotheca Cornubiensis_, I owe many valuable hints and suggestions, and the opportunity of consulting some important works of reference. "
26,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"I have elsewhere acknowledged the valuable information with regard to certain rare editions and pamphlets which I have received from Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B. "
27,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"My especial thanks for laborious researches undertaken on my behalf, and for information not otherwise attainable, are due to M. J.E. Aynard, of Lyons; Signor F. Bianco; Professor Max von Förster, of Wurtzburg; Professor Lajos Gurnesovitz, of Buda Pest; Dr. Holzhausen, of Bonn; Mr. Leonard Mackall, of Berlin; Miss Peacock; Miss K. Schlesinger; M. Voynich, of Soho Square; Mr. Theodore Bartholomew, of the University Library of Cambridge; Mr. T.D. Stewart, of the Croydon Public Library; and the Librarians of Trinity College, Cambridge, and University College, St. Andrews. "
28,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"I have also to thank, for special and generous assistance, Mr. J.P. Anderson, late of the British Museum, the author of the ""Bibliography of Byron's Works"" attached to the Life of Lord Byron by the Hon. Roden Noel (1890); Miss Grace Reed, of Philadelphia, for bibliographical entries of early American editions; and Professor Vladimir Hrabar, of the University of Dorpat, for the collection and transcription of numerous Russian translations of Byron's Works. "
29,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"To Messrs. Clowes, the printers of these volumes, and to their reader, Mr. F.T. Peachey, I am greatly indebted for the transcription of Slavonic titles included in the Summary of the Bibliography, and for interesting and useful information during the progress of the work. "
30,PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.,"In conclusion, I must once more express my acknowment of the industry and literary ability of my friend Mr. F.E. Taylor, of Chertsey, who has read the proofs of this and the six preceding volumes. "

138,"FROM THE POEM ""CARTHON.""","O THOU! who rollest in yon azure field, Round as the orb of my forefather's shield, Whence are thy beams? From what eternal store Dost thou, O Sun! thy vast effulgence pour? In awful grandeur, when thou movest on high, The stars start back and hide them in the sky; The pale Moon sickens in thy brightening blaze, And in the western wave avoids thy gaze. Alone thou shinest forth--for who can rise Companion of thy splendour in the skies! The mountain oaks are seen to fall away-- Mountains themselves by length of years decay-- With ebbs and flows is the rough Ocean tost; In heaven the Moon is for a season lost, But thou, amidst the fullness of thy joy, The same art ever, blazing in the sky! When tempests wrap the world from pole to pole, When vivid lightnings flash and thunders roll, Thou far above their utmost fury borne, Look'st forth in beauty, laughing them to scorn. But vainly now on me thy beauties blaze-- Ossian no longer can enraptured gaze! Whether at morn, in lucid lustre gay, On eastern clouds thy yellow tresses play, Or else at eve, in radiant glory drest, Thou tremblest at the portals of the west, I see no more! But thou mayest fail at length, Like Ossian lose thy beauty and thy strength, Like him--but for a season--in thy sphere To shine with splendour, then to disappear! Thy years shall have an end, and thou no more Bright through the world enlivening radiance pour, But sleep within thy clouds, and fail to rise, Heedless when Morning calls thee to the skies! Then now exult, O Sun! and gaily shine, While Youth and Strength and Beauty all are thine. For Age is dark, unlovely, as the light Shed by the Moon when clouds deform the night, Glimmering uncertain as they hurry past. Loud o'er the plain is heard the northern blast, Mists shroud the hills, and 'neath the growing gloom, The weary traveller shrinks and sighs for home. "
141,FOOTNOTES:,"[2] [I am indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Pierre De La Rose for sending me a copy of the foregoing _Version of Ossian's Address to the Sun_, which was ""Privately printed at the Press of Oliver B. Graves, Cambridge, Massachusetts, June the Tenth, MDCCCXCVIII.,"" and was reprinted in the _Atlantic Monthly_ in December, 1898. A prefatory note entitled, ""From Lord Byron's Notes,"" is prefixed to the Version: ""In Lord Byron's copy of _The Poems of Ossian_ (printed by Dewick and Clarke, London, 1806), which, since 1874, has been in the possession of the Library of Harvard University as part of the Sumner Bequest. The notes which follow appear in Byron's hand."" (For the _Notes_, see the _Atlantic Monthly_, 1898, vol. lxxxii. pp. 810-814.) "
142,FOOTNOTES:,"It is strange that Byron should have made two versions (for another ""version"" from the Newstead MSS., see _Poetical Works_, 1898, i. 229-231) of the ""Address to the Sun,"" which forms the conclusion of ""Carthon;"" but the Harvard version appears to be genuine. It is to be noted that Byron appended to the earlier version eighteen lines of his own composition, by way of moral or application.] "
146,WRITTEN ON BOARD THE LISBON PACKET.,"HUZZA! Hodgson[3], we are going, Our embargo's off at last; Favourable breezes blowing Bend the canvas o'er the mast. From aloft the signal's streaming, Hark! the farewell gun is fired; Women screeching, tars blaspheming, Tell us that our time's expired.

There need not schools nor the professor's chair, Though these be good, true wisdom to impart; He, who has not enough for these to spare Of time, or gold, may yet amend his heart, And teach his soul by brooks and rivers fair, Nature is always wise in every part.""

313,FOOTNOTES:,"But first as he flew, I forgot to say, That he hovered a moment upon his way, To look upon Leipsic plain; And so sweet to his eye was its sulphury glare, And so soft to his ear was the cry of despair, That he perched on a mountain of slain; And he gazed with delight from its growing height, Nor often on earth had he seen such a sight, Nor his work done half as well: For the field ran so red with the blood of the dead,                 40 That it blushed like the waves of Hell!

And stretched by the wall of a ruined hut, With its hollow cheek, and eyes half shut, A child of Famine dying: And the carnage _begun_, when _resistance_ is done, And the fall of the vainly flying! "
321,FOOTNOTES:,"Then he gazed on a town by besiegers taken, Nor cared he who were winning; But he saw an old maid, for years forsaken, Get up and leave her spinning;                                     80 And she looked in her glass, and to one that did pass, She said--""pray are the rapes beginning?""[39] "

General Dulauloy had entrusted the operation to Colonel Montford. The Colonel, instead of remaining on the spot to direct it, and to give the signal, ordered a corporal and four sappers to blow up the bridge the instant the enemy should appear. The corporal, an ignorant fellow, and ill comprehending the nature of the duty with which he was charged, upon hearing the first shot discharged from the ramparts of the city, set fire to the fougades and blew up the bridge. A part of the army was still on the other side, with a park of 80 pieces of artillery and some hundreds of waggons. The advance of this part of the army, who were approaching the bridge, seeing it blow up, conceived it was in the power of the enemy. A cry of dismay spread from rank to rank. 'The enemy are close upon our rear, and the bridges are destroyed!' The unfortunate soldiers dispersed, and endeavoured to effect their escape as well as they could. The Duke of Tarentum swam across the river. Prince Poniatowsky, mounted on a spirited horse, darted into the water and appeared no more.

See, too, a passage (p. 226) in which he alludes to Coleridge as a living writer, whose ""singular character and unintelligible style"" might, in any other country but England, have won for him attention if not approval. His own ""conversion"" from the extreme liberalism of the _Vindiciæ Gallicæ_ of 1791 to the philosophic conservatism of the _Introductory Discourse_ (1798) to his lecture on _The Law of Nature and Nations_, was regarded with suspicion by Wordsworth and Coleridge, who, afterwards, were still more effectually ""converted"" themselves.] "

What spread from face to face that wondering air? The thought of Brutus[57]--for his was not there! That absence proved his worth,--that absence fixed His memory on the longing mind, unmixed;                             10 And more decreed his glory to endure, Than all a gold Colossus could secure.

849,FOOTNOTES:,"[127] [George Frederick Nott (1767-1841), critic and divine, was Rector of Harrietsham and Woodchurch, a Prebendary of Winchester and of Salisbury. He was Bampton Lecturer in 1802, and, soon afterwards, was appointed sub-preceptor to the Princess Charlotte of Wales. He was a connoisseur of architecture and painting, and passed much of his time in Italy and at Rome. When he was at Pisa he preached in a private room in the basement story of the house in Pisa where Shelley was living, and fell under Byron's displeasure for attacking the Satanic school, and denouncing _Cain_ as a blasphemous production. ""The parsons,"" he told Moore (letter, February 20, 1820), ""preached at it [_Cain_] from Kentish Town to Pisa."" Hence the apostrophe to Dr. Nott. (See _Records of Shelley, Byron, and the Author_, by E.T. Trelawny, 1887, pp. 302, 303.)] "
850,FOOTNOTES:,"[128] [According to Lady Anne Hamilton (_Secret History of the Court of England_, 1832, i. 198-207), the Princess Charlotte incurred the suspicion and displeasure of her uncles and her grandmother, the Queen, by displaying an ardent and undue interest in her sub-preceptor. On being reproved by the Queen for ""condescending to favour persons in low life with confidence or particular respect, persons likely to take advantage of your simplicity and innocence,"" and having learnt that ""persons"" meant Mr. Nott, she replied by threatening to sign a will in favour of her sub-preceptor, and by actually making over to him by a deed her library, jewels, and all other private property. Lady Anne Hamilton is not an accurate or trustworthy authority, but her extremely circumstantial narrative was, no doubt, an expansion of the contemporary scandal to which Byron's lampoon gave currency.] "

3875,FUGITIVE PIECES.,"_Note_ (1).--A facsimile of the Title-page (2) faces p. xii. of vol. i. of the _Poetical Works_, 1898. It has been alleged that large-paper copies of this edition were issued from the Newark press. It is certain that large copies (a copy in the British Museum, cut for binding, measures 220 X 122), printed on paper bearing a water-mark dated 1806, were thrown upon the market at an early period, but it has not been ascertained at what date or in what place they were printed. They are undoubtedly deliberate forgeries. They purport, even in respect of _errata_, to be identical with the genuine issue of 1807; but they were not set up from the same type, and it is inconceivable that a second issue, set up from different type and with slightly different ornaments, was printed by Ridge for piratical purposes. To cite a few obvious differences--in the title of the large-paper copies the first A of the word ""TRANSLATED"" is printed "
3876,FUGITIVE PIECES.,"[Greek: L ], and the Greek [Greek: n] in [Greek: ainee] and [Greek: neikei] appears as [Greek: u] (not [Greek: n] reversed); in the Errata on the reverse of p. xiii., [Page] ""153 Note"" is incorrectly given as ""163 Note,"" and this slip on the part of the _falsarius_ is more remarkable, as two other errata in the Errata are carefully reproduced; in the Greek motto on p. 22 the letter [Greek: r] twice appears as [Greek: s]; and, finally, the ornaments on pp. 1 and 187, though intended to be, are not identical. In the Museum copy a portrait of ""Lord Byron, from a sketch taken on his leaving England,"" engraved by I. West, and ""Published by V. Hone, Ludgate Hill, 1819,"" precedes the title-page, and, together with the binding, affords good, if not conclusive, proof that this copy was printed before 1820. "
3877,FUGITIVE PIECES.,"See, for a correspondence on these L.P. copies of 1807, the _Athenæum_, June, 1898, pp. 694, 695. "
3878,FUGITIVE PIECES.,"See, too, for further interesting and conclusive evidence that the ornament on p. 187 of the L.P. copies was not printed from the Newark block, _Newark as a Publishing Town_, by T.M. Blagg, 1898, pp. 28-30. "
3879,FUGITIVE PIECES.,"_Note_ (2).--An autograph note, dated May 20th, 1812, signed ""Byron,"" is inserted on the fly-leaf of a large-paper copy in the Rowfant Library (_Catalogue_, 1886, p. 144). "

3998,XII.,"Miscellaneous Poems/ on His Domestic and Other/ Circum-stances./ By Lord Byron./ London:/ Printed By and for William Cole,/ 10 Newgate-Street./ 1825./ [12º. "
4000,XII.,"Pp. 54. The Imprint (_Printed by William Cole, 10, Newgate Street_.) is at the foot of p. 54. "
4001,XII.,"_Note_.--The edition contains twenty-nine pieces, viz. the twenty-five poems published by John Bumpus in 1824 (No. xl.), together with _The Isles of Greece_; _Were my Bosom_, etc.; _Herod's Lament_, etc.; and _Lord Byron's Latest Verses_ (""On this day I complete my thirty-sixth year""). "
4003,XII.,"_Note_.--Two sets of proofs of a portion of _Hints from Horace_, formerly the property of R.C. Dallas, are preserved in the British Museum (_Eg_. 2029). Proof A consists of 100 lines of the English translation (lines 173-272); Proof B, pp. [87]-128, consists of 272 lines of the English translation (lines 1-272) and (on opposite pages) 188 lines of the original Latin. These proof-sheets, which must have followed proofs of the Fifth Edition of _English Bards_, _etc_., are preceded by a Half-title, _Hints from Horace_ (Gothic characters), and by the following subsidiary title:-- "
4004,XII.,"Hints from Horace:/ Being a/ Partial Imitation, in English Verse, of the Epistle,/ ""Ad Pisones de Arte Poetica;""/ And intended as a Sequel to/ English Bards and Scotch Reviewers./ [Gothic characters.] ""Ergo fungar vice Cotis, acutum/ Reddere quæ ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secandi.""/ Hor. De Arte Poet. 304-5./ ""Rhymes are difficult things; they are stubborn things, sir.""/ Fielding's Amelia, Vol. III./ Book and Chap. V./ Athens, Franciscan Convent,/ March 12, 1811./ "
4005,XII.,"The publication of _Hints from Horace_ had been entrusted by Dallas to Cawthorn in July-August, 1811. It may be gathered from various sources (_Letters_, 1898, ii. 24, 54, 56) that Byron was at work on the proofs as late as September 4; that by October 11 he had resolved to defer the publication of the _Hints_; and that, accordingly on October 13, 1811, ""they stood still."" It was not, however, till after the appearance of _Childe Harold's_, _etc_. (May-June, 1812) that Byron determined to suppress the already printed Fifth Edition of _English Bards_, and at the same time to abandon the publication of his two other Satires. At this time, says Dallas (_Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron_, 1898, p. 241), ""the _Hints from Horace_ was far advanced."" In his _Recollections, etc_. (pp. 104-113), he gives, by way of a ""fair specimen,"" 156 ""lines of the still-unpublished poem; and, as these extracts are taken from the first 211 lines, and his text corresponds with proof B (see Poetical Works, 1898, i. 390, variants ii., iii.), it may be inferred that Dallas transcribed them from his fragmentary proof-sheets, and that the press was stopped at line 272. In 1830, in his _Notices of the Life of Lord Byron_ (vol. i. pp. 263-269), Moore printed 165 lines of the ""Paraphrase;"" but his selections are drawn from lines 1-458, and it is evident that he had access to an original MS. (_MS. M._), which is now in Mr. Murray's possession. The full text, which follows the same MS., was first published in vol. v. pp. 273-327 of the six-volume edition of 1831 (_vide ante_, No. xliii. of ""Collected Editions""). "
4007,XII.,"Byron wrote the _Irish Avatar_ at Ravenna, September 16, 1821. On the 17th he sent a copy of the verses to Moore, then resident at Paris; and on September 20 he desired Moore to get ""twenty copies of the whole carefully and privately printed off."" A copy is in the possession of Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B., and I am indebted to his kindness for the following description: ""The pamphlet consists of four 8vo leaves, viz. half-title ('The Irish Avatar,' in bold capitals, with blank verse), pp. [1], [2] + Text, pp. 3-8. The poem begins on the third page with a dropped head, 'The Irish Avatar' again, and the first four verses. Pp. 4-7 contain six verses each, and p. 8 the remaining four, making up thirty-two in all. The date at the end of p. 8 is 'September 16, 1821.' There is no title-page proper; a headline, 'The Irish Avatar,' occurs on pp. 4-8, which pages are numbered in Arabic figures in the outside corners, and the thirty-two stanzas are also numbered in Arabic figures. The poem is printed on a half-sheet of a peculiar fine-ribbed paper."" Twenty stanzas of _The Irish Avatar_ were printed by Medwin in _Conversations of Lord Byron_, 1824, pp. 216-220, and in a second edition, 1824, pp. 332-338. In a ""new edition"" of the _Conversations, etc._, 1824, pp. 264-270, the entire poem, numbering thirty-two stanzas, was published for the first time in England (see _Athenæum_, July 27, 1901). _The Irish Avatar_ was first published by Murray in 1831 (Works, vi. 419-425).

4202,I.,"""Pages 213-233 of the Anmerkungen"" are devoted to an essay on the play as a whole. This essay is evidently the ""Appendix to an English Work,"" to which Byron refers in the letter accompanying the suppressed Dedication to _Marino Faliero_. ""In the Appendix to an English Work, lately translated into German, and published at Leipzig, a judgment of yours upon English poetry is quoted as follows: 'That in English poetry great genius, universal power, a feeling of profundity, with sufficient tenderness and force are to be found, but that altogether these do not constitute poets,'"" etc., etc. (see _Poetical Works_, 1901, v. 340, 341, and _Letters_, 1900, v. 100-103). The originals of the Dedication and Letters were conveyed to Goethe by John Murray the third, in 1830 (? 1831) (see _Goethe-Jahrbuch_, 1899, xx. pp. 31-35, where the ""Dedication"" is printed in full for the first time), and are preserved at Weimar in the ""red portfolio"" (cf. _Eckermann_, March 26, 1826), in which Goethe kept all his papers connected with Byron. The ""judgments"" quoted by Byron through ""an Italian abstract"" from Wagner's Appendix (pp. 217-218) there read _inaccurately_ as follows: ""In der Englischen Poesie,"" sagt Goethe, ""man findet durchaus einen grossen, tüchtigen, weltgeübten Verstand, ein tiefes, zartes, Gemüth, ein vortreffliches Wollen, ein leidenschaftliches Wirken ... das alles zuzammengenommen macht noch keinen Poeten ... nach dieser Ansicht zeigen die meisten Englischen Gedichte einen düstern Ueberdruss des Lebens."" These sentences, which should be read in the light of the context, will be found in Goethe's _Dichtung und Wahrheit_, Th. iii. Buch. 13 (1814, now Wirke, Weimar ed. xxviii. 213, 214), the book (_Aus meinem Leben, Dichtung und Wahrheit_), which is held up to ridicule in the _Edinburgh Review_, June, 1816, vol. xxvi. pp. 304-317.

4930,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","_Note_ (1).--ON GENUINE AND SPURIOUS ISSUES OF ""ENGLISH BARDS, AND SCOTCH REVIEWERS."" "
4931,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","Among the first who called attention to the ""inextricable tangle"" of the several editions of _English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers_ was Mr. Leicester Warren, better known as Lord de Tabley, who communicated some notes in 1877 to _Notes and Queries_ (Series V. vol. vii. pp. 145, etc.); but it was reserved to the late Mr. Dykes Campbell, Mr. Bertram Dobell, and other correspondents to the _Athenæum_ (May 5 to July 7, 1894), to point out that the problem was still farther complicated by the existence of spurious issues of at least three out of the five or six distinct editions of the Satire. "
4932,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","All editions, genuine or spurious, claim as their publisher ""James Cawthorn, British Library, No. 24 Cockspur Street,"" but different printers were employed. The First Edition bears the imprint of ""T. Collins, Printer, No. 1, Harvey's Buildings, Strand;"" the Second Edition, that of ""Deans and Co. Hart Street, Covent Garden;"" the Third Edition, that of ""T. Collins,"" etc.; the Fourth Edition of 1810, that of ""T. Collins,"" etc.; the Fourth Edition of 1811 (""James Cawthorn and Sharpe and Hailes""), that of ""Cox, Son, and Baylis, Great Queen Street, London."" No printer's name was attached to the suppressed Fifth Edition of 1812. "
4933,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","Genuine First Editions have the water-mark, ""E. and P. 1804,"" or ""E. and P. 1805,"" or, possibly, no water-mark at all. A copy of the spurious First Edition, in Mr. Murray's possession, has the water-mark, ""S. and C. Wise, 1812."" In addition to at least eleven variants in punctuation, the spurious copy prints (p. 5, line 47) ""Wizzard"" (p. 20 _n_.), ""M_e_deira,"" and, in the same note, ""Anna d'Afert;"" whereas the genuine copies print correctly ""Wizard,"" ""Madeira,"" and ""Anna d'Arfet."" "
4934,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","A genuine copy of the Second Edition, which belonged to the late Mr. Dykes Campbell, bears the water-mark ""Budgen and Willmot, 1808."" On p. 80, line 1007, ""Abedeen"" is misprinted for ""Aberdeen;"" and the same misprint occurs in a copy of the Second Edition in the British Museum. In all probability there was no spurious issue of the Second Edition. "
4935,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","Of the Third Edition (1810), copies bearing the water-mark, ""E.&P. 1804,"" or ""G.&R.T.,"" may be regarded as genuine--rare exceptions among a host of forgeries which either lack a water-mark altogether or bear water-marks of a later period. Mr. Gilbert R. Redgrave, in an article (_The Library_, December 1, 1899, Series II. vol. i. pp. 18-25), notes two distinct and divergent forgeries bearing the water-mark ""Pine, and Thomas, 1812."" Forgery A prints ""myse"" for ""muse"" (line 4), ""rove"" for ""rave"" (line 384), etc.; while forgery B, in a footnote to p. 30, prints ""Bowle'ss"" for ""Bowles's,"" and, at the end of p. 85, ""we"" for ""me,"" and ""farther"" for ""further."" Other copies bear the water-marks, ""Allnutt, 1816,"" ""Smith & Allnutt, 1816,"" ""Ivy Mills, 1817,"" and ""I.&R. Ansell, 1818."" A copy of a spurious issue of the Third Edition in the British Museum prints ""crawl"" for ""scrawl"" (line 47), and ""p. 73"" for ""p. 85."" "
4936,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","It has been surmised, but conclusive proof is not forthcoming, that a so-called Fourth Edition of 1810 (1050 lines), which purports to have been published by James Cawthorn, and bears the imprint, ""_Printed by J. Collins, Harvey's Buildings, Strand, London_,"" is a spurious issue. It is practically a reprint of the Third Edition; but in some copies there are misprints not to be found in other piracies--_e.g._ ""crouds"" for ""crowds"" (line 269), and ""alter"" for ""altar""(line 285). "
4937,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","Copies of the Fourth Edition of 1810, which may possibly be genuine, bear a water-mark, ""G.&R.T.,"" or are on plain paper. Copies which are manifestly forgeries bear the water-marks, ""J.X. 1810"" and ""W. Pickering, 1816."" "
4938,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","A second Fourth Edition (1052 lines), published by ""James Cawthorn and Sharp & Hailes, 1811,"" and printed by ""Cox, Son, & Baylis,"" was certainly recognized by Byron as a genuine Fourth Edition, and must have passed through his hands, or been subject to his emendation, before it was sent to press. Copies of this edition bear his MS. emendations of 1811-1812, and marginal notes of 1816. Genuine copies (_e.g._ Leigh Hunt's copy, now in the Forster Collection at the South Kensington Museum) are printed on paper bearing a water-mark, ""J. Whatman, 1805."" There was, however, another issue of the Fourth Edition of 1811, printed on plain paper. Mr. Redgrave notes certain minute differences between these two issues. In the edition on plain paper there is a hyphen to ""Cockspur-Street"" on the title-page, and the word ""Street"" is followed by a comma instead of a semicolon. Again, in the plain-paper copies ""Lambe"" is spelt with an _e_, and in the water-mark copies the word is correctly spelt ""Lamb."" In the plain-paper copies the misprint ""Postcript"" for ""Postscript"" is repeated, and in the copies bearing a water-mark the word is correctly spelt ""Postscript."" There are other differences in the advertisements at the end of the volume. "
4939,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","A spurious Fourth Edition in Mr. Murray's possession, which has been enriched with a series of prints of persons and places, bears the water-marks, ""1811,"" ""1814."" Each page has been inserted into a folio sheet bearing the water-mark, ""J. Whatman, 1816."" A full-sized octavo, in small print (B.M. 11645 P. 15), which purports to be the Fourth Edition of 1811, is probably spurious. It is the survival of a distinct issue from other genuine or spurious copies of the Fourth Edition. "
4940,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","The spurious issues of the Third and Fourth Editions, whether they were printed in Ireland or were secretly thrown upon the market by James Cawthorn after Byron had definitely selected Murray as his publisher, were designed for the general reader and not for the collector. The issue of a spurious First Edition after the improved and enlarged editions of 1809-11 were published, must have been designed for the Byron enthusiast, if not the collector of First Editions. "
4941,"SCOTCH REVIEWERS.""","The Grangerized Fourth Editions prepared by Mr. W.M. Tartt and Mr. Evans in 1819, 1820, and a Third, by John Murray at about the same period, and, more remarkable still, a copy of the Fourth Edition of 1811, prefaced by a specially printed ""List of Names mentioned in the _English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers_"" interleaved with the additions made in the Fifth Edition (B.M.), point to the existence of a circle of worshippers who were prepared to treat Byron's _Juvenilia_ as seriously as the minute critics of the present generation. They seem to have been sufficiently numerous to make piracy, if not forgery, profitable. "
