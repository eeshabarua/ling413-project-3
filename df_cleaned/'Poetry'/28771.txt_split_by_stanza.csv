6,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"The fair Sidselil, of all maidens the flower, With her mother the Queen sat at work in her bower. "
7,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"So hard at the woof the fair Sidselil plies, That out from her bosom, so white, the milk flies. "
8,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Now hear thou, O Sidselil, child of my heart, What causes the milk from thy bosom to start?"" "
9,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""O that is not milk, my dear mother, I vow, It is but the mead I was drinking just now."" "
10,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Unlike are the two, most unlike to the sight, The one it is brown, and the other is white."" "
11,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""I see it is best that the truth be declared, The handsome Child Maidelvold me has ensnared."" "
12,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""And if it be truth what thou now hast declared, And handsome Child Maidelvold thee has ensnared, "
13,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Aloft on the gallows I'll hang him, I trow, And burn thee to ashes the gallows below."" "
14,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"Proud Sidselil she her blue mantle puts on, And unto Child Maidelvold's bower she is gone. "
15,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"With her fingers so tapering she twirled at the pin: ""Child Maidelvold rise, and with speed let me in."" "
16,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""I've summoned no one the tribunal before, And at night to no one will I open my door."" "
17,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Child Maidelvold rise, I beseech, in Christ's name, I've spoke to my mother who knows of my shame. "
18,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Aloft on the gallows she'll hang thee, I trow, And burn me to ashes the gallows below."" "
19,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""O I will not hang, my sweet maiden, for thee And thou shalt not burn, my sweet maiden, for me. "
20,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Collect thou thy gold in the coffer with speed, And I'll to the stable and saddle my steed."" "
21,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"He flung round the maiden his mantle so wide, And he lifted her up on his courser of pride. "
22,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"They came to the wood of the briar and rose, There Sidselil craved for a while to repose. "
23,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Now art thou fatigued by thy journey, sweet love, Or say, does the saddle too close for thee prove?"" "
24,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""I am not o'ercome by the journey, sweet love, But the saddle too close for my burden doth prove."" "
25,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"He spread on the cold earth his mantle so wide: ""Here rest thee a space and I'll watch by thy side."" "
26,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""O Jesus, that one of my maidens were near, The pains of a mother are on me I fear."" "
27,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Thy maidens are now at a distance from thee, And thou hast no one to assist thee but me."" "
28,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""'Twere better to perish again and again, Than thou should'st stand by me and gaze on my pain."" "
29,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Then take off thy kerchief and cover my head, And perhaps I may stand in the wise woman's stead."" "
30,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""One draught of pure water could'st thou bring me now, To cheer up my heart that is sinking so low?"" "
31,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"So faithful to her was the Child, and so true, He fetched her the drink in her gold spangled shoe. "
32,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"Child Maidelvold sped through the forest so black, He went to the fountain the wearisome track. "
33,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"And when he arrived at the fount in the vale, Two nightingales sat there and sang him their tale: "
34,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"""Dead Sidselil lieth beneath the green bough, With two little babes on her bosom of snow."" "
35,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"He paid little heed to the nightingales' lay, And traced through the forest his wearisome way. "
36,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"But, ah! what a spectacle burst on his view, The little birds' story he found to be true. "
37,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"A grave broad and deep has Child Maidelvold made, Therein the unfortunate three he has laid. "
38,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"As o'er them he clamped the mould down with his boot, He thought that the babies screamed under his foot. "
39,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"Against a grey stone has the Child set his sword, The point of the blade his heart mortally gor'd. "
40,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"He was true to his Sidselil whilst he had breath, He lies 'neath the earth now beside her in death. "
41,CHILD MAIDELVOLD.,"*** Another, but widely different, version of this Ballad was printed in _Romantic Ballads_, 1826, pp. 28-31, under the title _Sir Middel_.  In this version the name of the heroine is Swanelil, in place of Sidselil; and that of the hero is Sir Middel, in place of Child Maidelvold. "
43,SIR PETER.,"Sir Peter and Kirstin they sat by the board, Betwixt them in jest there passed many a word. "
44,SIR PETER.,"""Now listen to me, good Sir Peter the knight, Say, when wilt thou me to thy bridal invite?"" "
45,SIR PETER.,"""'Twill be held in a far distant country, I trow, So far that to come quite unable art thou."" "
46,SIR PETER.,"""And though thou shouldst hold it, Sir Peter, in Rome, If thou shouldst invite me I'd certainly come."" "
47,SIR PETER.,"""And if at my bridals thou wish to appear, Behind thou must leave all thy red golden gear."" "
48,SIR PETER.,"""In my red golden gear I will ever go dight, For it was not gained by dishonor, Sir Knight."" "
49,SIR PETER.,"Sir Peter he bids them his bridals get ready, Cries Kirstin: ""Now shoe ye my palfrey so steady."" "
50,SIR PETER.,"Fair Kirstin she saddles her courser so gray, To the house of Sir Peter she taketh her way. "
51,SIR PETER.,"She rides her horse into Sir Peter's court yard, And there stood the knight, clad in sable and mard. "
52,SIR PETER.,"""Now hear thou, Sir Peter, so handsome and fine, Say, may I this day skink before thee the wine?"" "
53,SIR PETER.,"""To skink wine before me if thee I permit, Thou on the stone bench with the servants shalt sit."" "
54,SIR PETER.,Adown her cheeks trickled the tear-drops so free-- How hard by each mortal insulted to be! 
55,SIR PETER.,"To the high and wide hall good Sir Peter proceeds, Fair Kirstin behind him in rich scarlet weeds. "
56,SIR PETER.,"A coronet glittered her temples upon, And full of gold rings were her fingers, each one. "
57,SIR PETER.,"When into the hall little Kirstin she came, Uprose to receive her each maiden and dame. "
58,SIR PETER.,"She took in her fair hand the white silver can, To skink mead before the young knight she began. "
59,SIR PETER.,"The youthful bride said to her servant: ""Canst tell The name of that skinker, that sweet demoiselle?"" "
60,SIR PETER.,"Then answered the servant, as low as she might: ""'Tis only Sir Peter his love-lady light."" "
61,SIR PETER.,"""And if he possessed such a leman, why rode Sir Peter the knight to my father's abode? "
62,SIR PETER.,"""And had good Sir Peter a leman so brave, O why did he me of my father e'er crave. "
63,SIR PETER.,"""More gold she displays on her ten fingers small, Than my father could show in his good castle all."" "
64,SIR PETER.,"Now o'er was the supper, the laugh and the song, To retire to her bed the young bride she doth long. "
65,SIR PETER.,"With the bride to the bridal apartment they go, Fair Kirstin in front bears the yellow flambeau. "
66,SIR PETER.,"The bride in the soft bridal couch they have plac'd, To come to her arms good Sir Peter made haste. "
68,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"Ingefred and Gudrune they sate in their bower, Each bloomed a beauteous fragrant flower-- _So sweet it is in summer tide_! "
69,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"A working the gold fair Ingefred kept, Still sate Gudrune, and bitterly wept. "
70,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""Dear sister Gudrune so fain I'd know Why down thy cheek the salt tears flow?"" "
71,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""Cause enough have I to be thus forlorn, With a load of sorrow my heart is worn. "
72,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""Hear, Ingefred, hear what I say to thee, Wilt thou to-night stand bride for me? "
73,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""If bride for me thou wilt stand to-night, I'll give thee my bridal clothes thee to requite. "
74,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""And more, much more to thee I'll give, All my bride jewels thou shalt receive."" "
75,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""O I will not stand for bride in thy room, Save I also obtain thy merry bridegroom."" "
76,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""Betide me whatever the Lord ordain From me my bridegroom thou never shalt gain."" "
77,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"In silks so costly the bride they arrayed, And unto the kirk the bride they conveyed. "
78,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"In golden cloth weed the holy priest stands, He joins of Gudrune and Samsing the hands. "
79,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"O'er the downs and green grass meadows they sped, Where the herdsman watched his herd as it fed. "
80,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""Of thy beauteous self, dear Damsel, take heed, Ne'er enter the house of Sir Samsing, I rede. "
81,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""Sir Samsing possesses two nightingales Who tell of the Ladies such wondrous tales. "
82,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""With their voices of harmony they can declare Whether maiden or none has fallen to his share."" "
83,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"The chariot they stopped in the green wood shade, An exchange 'twixt them of their clothes they made. "
84,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"They change of their dress whatever they please, Their faces they cannot exchange with like ease. "
85,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"To Sir Samsing's house the bride they conveyed, Of the ruddy gold no spare was made. "
86,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"On the bridal throne the bride they plac'd, They skinked the mead for the bride to taste. "
87,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"Then said from his place the court buffoon, ""Methinks thou art Ingefred not Gudrune."" "
88,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"From off her hand a gold ring she took, Which she gave the buffoon with entreating look. "
89,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"Said he: ""I'm an oaf and have drunk too hard, To words of mine pay no regard."" "
90,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"'Twas deep at night, and down fell the mist, To her bed the young bride they assist. "
91,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"Sir Samsing spoke to his nightingales twain: ""Before my young bride sing now a strain. "
92,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""A song now sing which shall avouch Whether I've a maiden or none in my couch."" "
93,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""A maid's in the bed, that's certain and sure, Gudrune is standing yet on the floor."" "
94,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""Proud Ingefred straight from my couch retire! Gudrune come hither, or dread my ire! "
95,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""Now tell me, Gudrune, with open heart, What made thee from thy bed depart?"" "
96,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""My father, alas! dwelt near the strand, When war and bloodshed filled the land. "
97,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""Full eight there were broke into my bower, One only ravished my virgin flower."" "
98,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"Upon her fair cheek he gave a kiss: ""My dearest, my dearest, all sorrow dismiss; "
99,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"""My swains they were that broke into thy bower, 'Twas I that gathered thy virgin flower."" "
100,INGEFRED AND GUDRUNE.,"Fair Ingefred gained, because bride she had been, One of the King's knights of handsome mien. "
102,SIR RIBOLT.,Ribolt the son of a Count was he-- Gulborg he courted in secrecy. 
103,SIR RIBOLT.,"Since she was a child the maid he woo'd, And till she had come to womanhood. "
104,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Gulborg do thou become my bride, In a better land then thou shalt reside. "
105,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Unto the land I thee will bear, Where grief ne'er comes the mind to tear. "
106,SIR RIBOLT.,"""To an island 'neath a blissful sky, Where thou shalt live and never die."" "
107,SIR RIBOLT.,"""To the land thou never me wilt bear, But grief shall come the mind to tear. "
108,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Nor me to the isle wilt thou convey Where I've no death to the Lord to pay."" "
109,SIR RIBOLT.,"""O there no grass but the leek up-springs, And there no bird but the cuckoo sings. "
110,SIR RIBOLT.,"""No other water flows than wine, Thou may'st believe these words of mine."" "
111,SIR RIBOLT.,"""But how from the Castle can I fly? So many watch incessantly. "
112,SIR RIBOLT.,"""I'm watched by father, watched by mother, By sister I am watched, and brother. "
113,SIR RIBOLT.,"""I'm watched by the man to whom I'm plighted, And I fear him more than the rest united."" "
114,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Although by all thy clan controll'd, Thy promise to me thou yet shall hold. "
115,SIR RIBOLT.,"""In my acton blue I thee will case, And my golden helm on thy head I'll place. "
116,SIR RIBOLT.,"""I'll gird thee with my sword of worth, Then none will think that a maid rides forth. "
117,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Decked with my gilded spurs so free, Thou off may'st ride though thy father see."" "
118,SIR RIBOLT.,"O'er her he threw his mantle wide, And set her upon his steed of pride. "
119,SIR RIBOLT.,"When on the moor themselves they found, Met them a Count, in arms renown'd. "
120,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Here, Ribolt, hear, dear comrade mine, Say, who's that fair young page of thine?"" "
121,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Comrade, it is my youngest brother, I've ta'en him from his doting mother."" "
122,SIR RIBOLT.,"""It little avails such tales to tell; Gulborg, Gulborg, I know thee well. "
123,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Thy scarlet dress thou may'st disguise, But thy cheeks of rose I recognise. "
124,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Thy hair I know of fairest sort, For long I've served at thy father's court. "
125,SIR RIBOLT.,"""By thy garb and shoon I know thee not, But I know the knight who thy troth has got."" "
126,SIR RIBOLT.,"A bracelet drew she forth of gold, And gave it to that Count so bold: "
127,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Where'er thou rest thee at close of day, Be sure no word of me thou say."" "
128,SIR RIBOLT.,"The Count he rode to Kulloe house, Where the kemps were drinking a deep carouse. "
129,SIR RIBOLT.,He enter'd at Sir Truid's gate-- At his table wide Sir Truid sate. 
130,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Here, Truid, thou sitt'st the red wine taking, Whilst Ribolt off with thy bride is making."" "
131,SIR RIBOLT.,"Then through his hall Sir Truid roar'd: ""Up, up, ye knights, take helm and sward!"" "
132,SIR RIBOLT.,Barely a mile had they advanced When fair Gulborg behind her glanced. 
133,SIR RIBOLT.,"""O yonder my father's steed I see, And the knight who is betrothed to me."" "
134,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Gulborg, be therefore in no pain, But hold our steeds by the bridle rein. "
135,SIR RIBOLT.,"""And though to earth thou see me fall, Gulborg thou must not upon me call. "
136,SIR RIBOLT.,"""And though thou see me freely bleed, Let not my name from thy mouth proceed."" "
137,SIR RIBOLT.,"His helm on his head Sir Ribolt cast, Gulborg with her fair hands laced it fast. "
138,SIR RIBOLT.,"Then, crying his cry, he slays outright Her father dear and her plighted knight, "
139,SIR RIBOLT.,"And, at the second ""Halloo,"" he slew Her brothers with locks of yellow hue. "
140,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Desist, O Ribolt, my heart's ador'd, 'Tis time, 'tis time to sheath thy sword. "
141,SIR RIBOLT.,"""My youngest brother I pray thee spare, That he to my mother may tiding bear; "
142,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Bear her the tidings of the slaughter, O would she never had borne a daughter!"" "
143,SIR RIBOLT.,"Scarce had the name of Ribolt sounded, When Ribolt tottered, deadly wounded. "
144,SIR RIBOLT.,"He sheathed his faulchion, blood be-dyed: ""Come, dear Gulborg, we hence will ride."" "
145,SIR RIBOLT.,"They thread the mazes of the wood, No word escaped him, bad or good. "
146,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Hear, Ribolt, hear, my destined mate, Why art not glad as thou wast of late?"" "
147,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Gulborg, I feel my life-blood leak, Gulborg, I feel me faint and weak. "
148,SIR RIBOLT.,"""But chiefly, chiefly I look not pleas'd Because Death's hand my heart has seiz'd."" "
149,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Myself of my girdle I'll dis-array, And thy streaming blood will stanch and stay."" "
150,SIR RIBOLT.,"""God bless thee ever, my own true love, Of service slight will thy girdle prove."" "
151,SIR RIBOLT.,"And when to the Castle gate they won, His mother stood there and leaned thereon. "
152,SIR RIBOLT.,"""Welcome, my son, thou art welcome twice, And thy fair young bride she is welcome thrice. "
153,SIR RIBOLT.,"""I ne'er have seen a bride so pale Come travelling over hill and dale."" "
154,SIR RIBOLT.,"""If pale she be is a wonder slight, When she has witness'd so hard a fight. "
155,SIR RIBOLT.,"""God grant I may retain my breath Whilst parting presents I bequeath. "
156,SIR RIBOLT.,"""To my father I give my courser tall, O mother I pray thee a priest to call. "
157,SIR RIBOLT.,"""And unto my brother, who's standing near, I give Gulborg whom I love so dear."" "
158,SIR RIBOLT.,"""O willingly her to wife I'd take, If, brother, 'twere not for the black sin's sake."" "
159,SIR RIBOLT.,"""May the Lord God me in my trouble aid, So sure as she is for me a maid. "
160,SIR RIBOLT.,"""'Twas only once that I had the bliss From her rosy mouth to snatch a kiss."" "
161,SIR RIBOLT.,"""O better, better to sink in death, Than unto two brothers plight my faith."" "
162,SIR RIBOLT.,"Ribolt was dead ere the cock did cry, Gulborg was dead ere the sun was high. "
163,SIR RIBOLT.,"They bore from the Castle corses three, A handsome corse was each to see. "
164,SIR RIBOLT.,"The one was Ribolt, the other his bride, His mother the third, of grief she died. "
