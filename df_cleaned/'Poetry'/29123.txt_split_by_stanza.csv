7,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,THE FOUNTAIN OF MARIBO OR THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE 
8,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"The Algreve {7} he his bugle wound _The long night all_-- The Queen in bower heard the sound, _I'm passion's thrall_. "
9,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"The Queen her little page address'd, _The long night all_-- ""To come to me the Greve request,"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
10,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"He came, before the board stood he, _The long night all_-- ""Wherefore, O Queen, has sent for me?"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
11,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"""As soon as e'er my lord is dead, _The long night all_-- Thou shalt rule o'er my gold so red,"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
12,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"""O speak not, Queen, in such wild style, _The long night all_-- Thou know'st not who may list the while,"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
13,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"She fondly thought alone they were, _The long night all_-- There stood the King, to all gave ear, _I'm passion's thrall_. "
14,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"The King two serving men address'd, _The long night all_-- ""To come to me the Queen request,"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
15,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"""Hear thou, my Queen, so fair and sleek, _The long night all_-- What with the Algreve didst thou speak?"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
16,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"""The speech that I with him did hold, _The long night all_-- Was all about thy actions bold,"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
17,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"""The King two servants did command, _The long night all_-- ""Bid ye the Greve before me stand,"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
18,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"""Hear thou, my Greve, what with my Queen _The long night all_-- Didst thou discourse of yestere'en?"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
19,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"""The whole discourse that we did hold, _The long night all_-- Was of thy virtues manifold,"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
20,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"The King his little page address'd, _The long night all_-- ""To come to me the cook request,"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
21,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"""Thou cook, the Greve to pieces chop, _The long night all_-- And to thy Lady serve him up,"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
22,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"Long sat the Queen, the meat she eyed, _The long night all_-- ""This is no Roe I'm satisfied, _I'm passion's thrall_. "
23,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"""But 'tis the Greve our hall who grac'd."" _The long night all_-- The pieces she collects in haste, _I'm passion's thrall_. "
24,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"She wrapped them in white ermine skin, _The long night all_-- A gilded chest she placed them in. _I'm passion's thrall_. "
25,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"She them collects, then wends her slow, _The long night all_-- Unto the fount of Maribo. _I'm passion's thrall_. "
26,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"She dipped them in the water pure, _The long night all_-- ""Rise, Christian man, I thee conjure!"" _I'm passion's thrall_. "
27,THE QUEEN AND THE ALGREVE,"The man arose, and thanked his God, _The long night all_-- Then from the country forth he trod. _I'm passion's thrall_. "
29,RAMUND,"Ramund thought he should a better man be If better apparel arrayed him; Of garments of leather, and hemp patch'd together, The Queen then a present made him. ""These I will not wear,"" bold Ramund he said, ""They beseem me not fair,"" said Ramund the young. "
30,RAMUND,"""Your garments of tow and leather bestow On the cleaners of trencher and platter."" The Lady to give him fresh clothes was not slow, And of sammet and silk were the latter. ""Yes, these will I wear,"" bold Ramund he said, ""They beseem me right fair,"" said Ramund the young. "
31,RAMUND,"Ramund he into the shop now hies, Where the best of all tailors was sitting: ""Now wilt thou, O tailor, so dext'rous and wise, Make clothes for Ramund fitting?"" ""And why should I not?"" the tailor he said, ""Then thou'lt do well I wot,"" said Ramund the young. "
32,RAMUND,"""Twice twenty-five ells for the breeches take, Fifteen for the points of the breeches; And them thou must strong and durable make If thou therein settest stitches."" ""These are too tight,"" bold Ramund he said, ""I can't stride out aright,"" said Ramund the young. "
33,RAMUND,"Now Ramund his ships beside the shore With everything needful prepareth; And away, away, the salt ocean o'er To the land of the Jutuns he beareth. ""We are come to this soil,"" bold Ramund he said, ""And withouten much toil,"" said Ramund the young. "
34,RAMUND,"Ramund he wanders along the strand, There seven tall Giants faced him: ""If I take Ramund in my left hand I afar from the land will cast him."" ""You'll not do that alone,"" bold Ramund he said, ""Ye must come every one,"" said Ramund the young. "
35,RAMUND,"Ramund drew out his trusty glaive, To which Dymling for name he had given; And dead to the earth with seven blows brave He hewed the Jotuns seven. ""There ye all seven lie,"" bold Ramund he said, ""And still living am I,"" said Ramund the young. "
36,RAMUND,"Ramund walked on till the big Jutt he spied, And to see him he sorely wonder'd; For full fifty ells was his carcase wide, And his height was nearly a hundred. ""What a breadth, what a height!"" bold Ramund he said, ""Dost wish for a fight?"" said Ramund the young. "
37,RAMUND,"""Dear Ramund, if thou wilt let me live, And to me no damage wilt proffer, I'll bathe thee in wine, and to thee I will give Seven bushels of gold from my coffer."" ""Make 'em eight, if you will,"" bold Ramund he said, ""I will cut thee down still,"" said Ramund the young. "
38,RAMUND,"The first, first day that together they fought With their naked fists they contested; Then Ramund he hold of the Jutt's beard caught And the flesh from the teeth he wrested. ""Thou grinnest full evil, bold Ramund,"" he said, ""Thou look'st worse than the Devil,"" said Ramund the young. "
39,RAMUND,"Next day they set to at the rise of the sun, Again with a rage unexampled; The huge stone mountain they stood upon To the earth 'neath their feet was trampled. ""'Tis hard sport, I swear!"" the giant he said, ""We began but this year,"" said Ramund the young. "
40,RAMUND,"Then Ramund again to his sword recurred, To which Dymling for name he had given; And the head of the Jutt, which no ox could have stirred, He hewed high unto the heaven. ""'Twould not cut well I thought,"" bold Ramund he said ""Yet it cut as it ought,"" said Ramund the young. "
41,RAMUND,"Ramund he into the mountain strode, Where the small trolds house were keeping; The tears fast down their visages flow'd, For Ramund they fell to weeping. ""Do ye weep for me,"" bold Ramund he said, ""I'll ne'er weep for ye,"" said Ramund the young. "
42,RAMUND,"Now Ramund behold is dealing his blows Like the Kemps most famed for fighting; About and around in the cave he goes To the earth the demons smiting. ""I rule here at my ease,"" bold Ramund he said, ""And can do what I please,"" said Ramund the young. "
43,RAMUND,"On his ship entered he so vehemently That it cracked his vehemence under; In the ship the men all began loudly to bawl And thought they should certainly founder. ""We shall not sink here,"" bold Ramund he said, ""So ye need not to fear,"" said Ramund the young. "
44,RAMUND,"Now Ramund he straight seven ships did freight With the gold which the Trolds had hoarded; Then across the tide to the land he hied O'er which the Emperor lorded. ""To this land we are come,"" bold Ramund he said, ""We no farther will roam,"" said Ramund the young. "
45,RAMUND,"On the white sand Ramund his anchor flung, The high prow strandward turning; And the very first man to land that sprung Was himself, with eagerness burning. ""Now do nothing more,"" bold Ramund he said, ""All labour give o'er,"" said Ramund the young. "
46,RAMUND,"To the Ball-house he sped, where the kempions play'd At ball with glee and vigour; But at his coming all stood adread, At the sight of so fierce a figure. ""Pretty sport is this same,"" bold Ramund he said, ""I'll make one in the game,"" said Ramund the young. "
47,RAMUND,"With fear and dismay upon his brow From a window the Emperor gazes: ""O who is that man in the yard below That makes such horrible faces?"" ""'Tis I, and with glee,"" bold Ramund he said, ""I'll do battle with thee,"" said Ramund the young. "
48,RAMUND,"Ramund he struck on his sword amain, The earth to its centre trembled; The small birds swooned and fell on the plain, On the bough that were singing assembled. ""Come down to me, knave,"" bold Ramund he said, ""Or by God I shall rave,"" said Ramund the young. "
49,RAMUND,"Ramund he into the door now trode, His face like a burning ember: ""Though iron and steel oppose my road I'll penetrate to his chamber."" ""Now be on thy guard,"" bold Ramund he said, ""I'm about to strike hard,"" said Ramund the young. "
50,RAMUND,"On the door Ramund smote with an iron bar stout, The castle was rent and parted; 'Neath that blow's power nod wall and tower, From their place the windows started. ""You see I broke in,"" bold Ramund he said, ""Now at stake is thy skin,"" said Ramund the young. "
51,RAMUND,"""Dear Ramund, dear Ramund, my life now spare, And with benefits thee I'll cover; I'll give thee my youngest daughter fair, And the half of the land I rule over."" ""Can take all any tide,"" bold Ramund he said, ""And thy daughter beside,"" said Ramund the young. "
52,RAMUND,"Ramund then drew out Dymling his blade, Of his valour the trusty assistant; And he hewed at the Emperor so that his head Flew fifteen furlongs distant. ""I thought 'twould not sever,"" bold Ramund he said, ""But the blood runs however,"" said Ramund the young. "
54,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Alf he dwells at Odderskier, Is rich and bold withal; Two stout and stalwart sons has he Whom men do kempions call. "
55,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Yes, two stout sons of mighty fame Has Alf of Odderskier; Of the king who dwells on Upsal fells They love the daughter fair. "
56,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"It was youthful Helmer Kamp, From stall his courser led; ""O I will hie me up the land And the king's fair daughter wed."" "
57,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"It was youthful Angelfyr He sprang on his courser's back: ""And I will ride to Upsal too, Though the earth beneath me crack."" "
58,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"And when they entered the castle yard They doffed their cloaks of skin; Then straight they strode to the high, high hall, To the monarch of Upsal in. "
59,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"In came youthful Helmer Kamp, With grace and beauty rife: ""O King, thy daughter dear I love, Wilt give her me for wife?"" "
60,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"In came youthful Angelfyr, His steely helmet shone: ""O King, give up thy daughter to me, And straight from the land begone."" "
61,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then answered soon the Upsal-King, And a brave reply he gave: ""On my daughter I'll no husband force, She'll choose whom she will have."" "
62,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""Now many thanks, dear father, that Thou leav'st the choice to me; I'll plight me to young Helmer Kamp, He's like a man to see. "
63,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""But I'll not have young Angelfyr, He's an ugly Trold to view; His father so is, his mother so is, So are all his kindred too."" "
64,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then answered the young Angelfyr, So sorely wroth he grew: ""Come, brother, come to the court-yard down, For her we will battle do."" "
65,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then up and spake the Upsal King, And the Upsal King did say: ""The swords are sharp, the swains are stark, There'll be, I trow, good play."" "
66,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Alf he stands at Odderskier, And he listens the mountains tow'rds; Then must he hear so far, far off The clash of his children's swords. "
67,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"And that heard Alf of Odderskier, So far across the down: ""What have my sons now got in hand? Why so wrathful are they grown?"" "
68,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"He tarried then so short a space, He sprang on his courser red; And he arrived at Upsala Before his sons lay dead. "
69,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""Now tell me, youthful Helmer Kamp, Tell me my dearest son, Wherefore so free from thy flesh and bone Those bloody rivers run?"" "
70,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Then answered the young Helmer Kamp, As he writhed him round with pain; This Angelfyr, my brother, has done Since the maid he could not gain. "
71,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"I have full fifteen mortal wounds, They are blent with poison all; But if I had only one of them, I dead full soon must fall."" "
72,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""Now list to me, young Angelfyr, Beloved son of mine; Say, wherefore trembles so the sword, In that good hand of thine?"" "
73,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""Ask'st thou why trembles so the sword In this right hand of mine? Because I've eighteen mortal wounds, And to hurt me they combine. "
74,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"""I have full eighteen mortal wounds, And each so deadly sore; If I had only one of them I could not live an hour."" "
75,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"It was Alf of Odderskier, An oak by the root uptore; It was the young Helmer Kamp Whom dead he laid in gore. "
76,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Now lie the valiant kempions two, Within a single grave; And the King to his daughter cannot give The swain whom she will have. "
77,ALF OF ODDERSKIER,"Sore sorrows Alf of Odderskier, His valiant children slain. Whilst Upsal's King may still at home His daughter fair retain. "
81,LONDON:,"{7}  A title of dignity, equivalent to that of Count. "
