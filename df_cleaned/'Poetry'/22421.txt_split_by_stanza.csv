11,EDITOR'S NOTE.,"In this edition of Herrick quotation is for the first time facilitated by the poems being numbered according to their order in the original edition. This numbering has rendered it possible to print those Epigrams, which successive editors have joined in deploring, in a detachable Appendix, their place in the original being indicated by the numeration. It remains to be added that the footnotes in this edition are intended to explain, as unobtrusively as possible, difficulties of phrase or allusion which might conceivably hinder the understanding of Herrick's meaning. In the longer Notes at the end of each volume earlier versions of some important poems are printed from manuscripts at the British Museum, and an endeavour has been made to extend the list of Herrick's debts to classical sources, and to identify some of his friends who have hitherto escaped research. An editor is always apt to mention his predecessors rather for blame than praise, and I therefore take this opportunity of acknowledging my general indebtedness to the pioneer work of Mr. Hazlitt and Dr. Grosart, upon whose foundations all editors of Herrick must necessarily build. "
14,PREFACE.,"It is singular that the first great age of English lyric poetry should have been also the one great age of English dramatic poetry: but it is hardly less singular that the lyric school should have advanced as steadily as the dramatic school declined from the promise of its dawn. Born with Marlowe, it rose at once with Shakespeare to heights inaccessible before and since and for ever, to sink through bright gradations of glorious decline to its final and beautiful sunset in Shirley: but the lyrical record that begins with the author of ""Euphues"" and ""Endymion"" grows fuller if not brighter through a whole chain of constellations till it culminates in the crowning star of Herrick. Shakespeare's last song, the exquisite and magnificent overture to ""The Two Noble Kinsmen,"" is hardly so limpid in its flow, so liquid in its melody, as the two great songs in ""Valentinian"": but Herrick, our last poet of that incomparable age or generation, has matched them again and again. As a creative and inventive singer, he surpasses all his rivals in quantity of good work; in quality of spontaneous instinct and melodious inspiration he reminds us, by frequent and flawless evidence, who above all others must beyond all doubt have been his first master and his first model in lyric poetry--the author of ""The Passionate Shepherd to his Love"". "
15,PREFACE.,"The last of his line, he is and will probably be always the first in rank and station of English song-writers. We have only to remember how rare it is to find a perfect song, good to read and good to sing, combining the merits of Coleridge and Shelley with the capabilities of Tommy Moore and Haynes Bayly, to appreciate the unique and unapproachable excellence of Herrick. The lyrist who wished to be a butterfly, the lyrist who fled or flew to a lone vale at the hour (whatever hour it may be) ""when stars are weeping,"" have left behind them such stuff as may be sung, but certainly cannot be read and endured by any one with an ear for verse. The author of the Ode on France and the author of the Ode to the West Wind have left us hardly more than a song a-piece which has been found fit for setting to music: and, lovely as they are, the fame of their authors does not mainly depend on the song of Glycine or the song of which Leigh Hunt so justly and so critically said that Beaumont and Fletcher never wrote anything of the kind more lovely. Herrick, of course, lives simply by virtue of his songs; his more ambitious or pretentious lyrics are merely magnified and prolonged and elaborated songs. Elegy or litany, epicede or epithalamium, his work is always a song-writer's; nothing more, but nothing less, than the work of the greatest song-writer--as surely as Shakespeare is the greatest dramatist--ever born of English race. The apparent or external variety of his versification is, I should suppose, incomparable; but by some happy tact or instinct he was too naturally unambitious to attempt, like Jonson, a flight in the wake of Pindar. He knew what he could not do: a rare and invaluable gift. Born a blackbird or a thrush, he did not take himself (or try) to be a nightingale. "
16,PREFACE.,It has often been objected that he did mistake himself for a sacred poet: and it cannot be denied that his sacred verse at its worst is as offensive as his secular verse at its worst; nor can it be denied that no severer sentence of condemnation can be passed upon any poet's work. But neither Herbert nor Crashaw could have bettered such a divinely beautiful triplet as this:-- 
17,PREFACE.,"""We see Him come, and know Him ours, Who with His sunshine and His showers Turns all the patient ground to flowers"". "
18,PREFACE.,That is worthy of Miss Rossetti herself: and praise of such work can go no higher. 
19,PREFACE.,"But even such exquisite touches or tones of colour may be too often repeated in fainter shades or more glaring notes of assiduous and facile reiteration. The sturdy student who tackles his Herrick as a schoolboy is expected to tackle his Horace, in a spirit of pertinacious and stolid straightforwardness, will probably find himself before long so nauseated by the incessant inhalation of spices and flowers, condiments and kisses, that if a musk-rat had run over the page it could hardly be less endurable to the physical than it is to the spiritual stomach. The fantastic and the brutal blemishes which deform and deface the loveliness of his incomparable genius are hardly so damaging to his fame as his general monotony of matter and of manner. It was doubtless in order to relieve this saccharine and ""mellisonant"" monotony that he thought fit to intersperse these interminable droppings of natural or artificial perfume with others of the rankest and most intolerable odour: but a diet of alternate sweetmeats and emetics is for the average of eaters and drinkers no less unpalatable than unwholesome. It is useless and thankless to enlarge on such faults or such defects, as it would be useless and senseless to ignore. But how to enlarge, to expatiate, to insist on the charm of Herrick at his best--a charm so incomparable and so inimitable that even English poetry can boast of nothing quite like it or worthy to be named after it--the most appreciative reader will be the slowest to affirm or imagine that he can conjecture. This, however, he will hardly fail to remark: that Herrick, like most if not all other lyric poets, is not best known by his best work. If we may judge by frequency of quotation or of reference, the ballad of the ride from Ghent to Aix is a far more popular, more generally admired and accredited specimen of Mr. Browning's work than ""The Last Ride Together""--and ""The Lost Leader"" than ""The Lost Mistress"". Yet the superiority of the less-popular poem is in either case beyond all question or comparison: in depth and in glow of spirit and of harmony, in truth and charm of thought and word, undeniable and indescribable. No two men of genius were ever more unlike than the authors of ""Paracelsus"" and ""Hesperides"": and yet it is as true of Herrick as of Browning that his best is not always his best-known work. Everyone knows the song, ""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may""; few, I fear, by comparison, know the yet sweeter and better song, ""Ye have been fresh and green"". The general monotony of style and motive which fatigues and irritates his too-persevering reader is here and there relieved by a change of key which anticipates the note of a later and very different lyric school. The brilliant simplicity and pointed grace of the three stanzas to Œnone (""What conscience, say, is it in thee"") recall the lyrists of the Restoration in their cleanlier and happier mood. And in the very fine epigram headed by the words ""Devotion makes the Deity"" he has expressed for once a really high and deep thought in words of really noble and severe propriety. His ""Mad Maid's Song,"" again, can only be compared with Blake's; which has more of passionate imagination, if less of pathetic sincerity. "
22,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Of the lives of many poets we know too much; of some few too little. Lovers of Herrick are almost ideally fortunate. Just such a bare outline of his life has come down to us as is sufficient to explain the allusions in his poems, and, on the other hand, there is no temptation to substitute chatter about his relations with Julia and Dianeme for enjoyment of his delightful verse. The recital of the bare outline need detain us but a few minutes: only the least imaginative of readers will have any difficulty in filling it in from the poems themselves. "
23,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"From early in the fourteenth century onwards we hear of the family of Eyrick or Herrick at Stretton, in Leicestershire. At the beginning of the sixteenth century we find a branch of it settled in Leicester itself, where John Eyrick, the poet's grandfather, was admitted a freeman in 1535, and afterwards acted as Mayor. This John's second son, Nicholas, migrated to London, became a goldsmith in Wood Street, Cheapside, and, according to a licence issued by the Bishop of London, December 8, 1582, married Julian, daughter of William Stone, sister of Anne, wife of Sir Stephen Soame, Lord Mayor of London in 1598. The marriage was not unfruitful. A William[A] Herrick was baptized at St. Vedast's, Foster Lane, November 24, 1585; Martha, January 22, 1586; Mercy, December 22, 1586; Thomas, May 7, 1588; Nicholas, April 22, 1589; Anne, July 26, 1590; and Robert himself, August 24, 1591. "
24,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"[A] A second William is said to have been born, posthumously, in ""Harry Campion's house at Hampton,"" in 1593. "
25,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Fifteen months after the poet's birth, on November 7, 1592, Nicholas Herrick made his will, estimating his property as worth £3000, and devising it, as to one-third to his wife, and as to the other two-thirds to his children in equal shares. In the will he described himself as ""of perfect memorye in sowle, but sicke in bodye"". Two days after its execution he was buried, having died, not from disease, but from a fall from an upper window. His death had so much the appearance of self-destruction that £220 had to be paid to the High Almoner, Dr. Fletcher, Bishop of Bristol, in satisfaction of his official claim to the goods and chattels of suicides. Herrick's biographers have not failed to vituperate the Bishop for his avarice, but dues allowed by law are hardly to be abandoned because a baby of fifteen months is destined to become a brilliant poet, and no other exceptional circumstances are alleged. The estate of Nicholas Herrick could the better afford the fine inasmuch as it realized £2000 more than was expected. "
26,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"By the will Robert and William Herrick were appointed ""overseers,"" or trustees for the children. The former was the poet's godfather, and in his will of 1617 left him £5. To William Herrick, then recently knighted for his services as goldsmith, jeweller, and moneylender to James I., the young Robert was apprenticed for ten years, September 25, 1607. An allusion to ""beloved Westminster,"" in his _Tears to Thamesis_, has been taken to refer to Westminster school, and alleged as proof that he was educated there. Dr. Grosart even presses the mention of Richmond, Kingston, and Hampton Court to support a conjecture that Herrick may have travelled up and down to school from Hampton. If so, one wonders what his headmaster had to say to the ""soft-smooth virgins, for our chaste disport"" by whom he was accompanied. But the references in the poem are surely to his courtier-life in London, and after his father's death the apprenticeship to his uncle in 1607 is the first fact in his life of which we can be sure. "
27,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"In 1607, Herrick was fifteen, and, even if we conjecture that he may have been allowed to remain at school some little time after his apprenticeship nominally began, he must have served his uncle for five or six years. Sir William had himself been bound apprentice in a similar way to the poet's father, and we have no evidence that he exacted any premium. At any rate, when in 1614, his nephew, then of age, desired to leave the business and go to Cambridge, the ten years' apprenticeship did not stand in his way, and he entered as a Fellow Commoner at St. John's. His uncle plainly still managed his affairs, for an amusing series of fourteen letters has been preserved at Beaumanor, until lately the seat of Sir William's descendants, in which the poet asks sometimes for payment of a quarterly stipend of £10, sometimes for a formal loan, sometimes for the help of his avuncular Mæcenas. It seems a fair inference from this variety of requests that, since Herrick's share of his father's property could hardly have yielded a yearly income of £40, he was allowed to draw on his capital for this sum, but that his uncle and Lady Herrick occasionally made him small presents, which may account for his tone of dependence. "
28,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"The quarterly stipend was paid through various booksellers, but irregularly, so that the poor poet was frequently reduced to great straits, though £40 a-year (£200 of our money) was no bad allowance. After two years he migrated from St. John's to Trinity Hall, to study law and curtail his expenses. He took his Bachelor's degree from there in January, 1617, and his Master's in 1620. The fourteen letters show that he had prepared himself for University life by cultivating a very florid prose style which frequently runs into decasyllabics, perhaps a result of a study of the dramatists. Sir William Herrick is sometimes addressed in them as his most ""careful"" uncle, but at the time of his migration the poet speaks of his ""ebbing estate,"" and as late as 1629 he was still £10 16s. 9d. in debt to the College Steward. We can thus hardly imagine that he was possessed of any considerable private income when he returned to London, to live practically on his wits, and a study of his poems suggests that, the influence of the careful uncle removed, whatever capital he possessed was soon likely to vanish.[B] His verses to the Earl of Pembroke, to Endymion Porter and to others, show that he was glad of ""pay"" as well as ""praise,"" but the system of patronage brought no discredit with it, and though the absence of any poetical mention of his uncle suggests that the rich goldsmith was not well-pleased with his nephew, with the rest of his well-to-do relations Herrick seems to have remained on excellent terms. "
29,LIFE OF HERRICK.,[B] Yet in his _Farewell to Poetry_ he distinctly says:-- 
30,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"""I've more to bear my charge than way to go""; "
31,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"the line, however, is a translation from his favourite Seneca, Ep. 77. "
32,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Besides patrons, such as Pembroke, Westmoreland, Newark, Buckingham, Herrick had less distinguished friends at Court, Edward Norgate, Jack Crofts and others. He composed the words for two New Year anthems which were set to music by Henry Lawes, and he was probably personally known both to the King and Queen. Outside the Court he reckoned himself one of Ben Jonson's disciples, ""Sons of Ben"" as they were called, had friends at the Inns of Court, knew the organist of Westminster Abbey and his pretty daughters, and had every temptation to live an amusing and expensive life. His poems were handed about in manuscript after the fashion of the time, and wherever music and poetry were loved he was sure to be a welcome guest. "
33,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Mr. Hazlitt's conjecture that Herrick at this time may have held some small post in the Chapel at Whitehall is not unreasonable, but at what date he took Holy Orders is not known. In 1627 he obtained the post of chaplain to the unlucky expedition to the Isle of Rhé, and two years later (September 30, 1629) he was presented by the King to the Vicarage of Dean Prior, in Devonshire, which the promotion of its previous incumbent, Dr. Potter, to the Bishopric of Carlisle, had left in the royal gift. The annual value of the living was only £50 (£250 present value), no great prize, but the poem entitled _Mr. Robert Hericke: his farwell unto Poetrie_ (not printed in _Hesperides_, but extant in more than one manuscript version) shows that the poet was not unaware of the responsibilities of his profession. ""But unto me,"" he says to his Muse: "
34,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"""But unto me be only hoarse, since now (Heaven and my soul bear record of my vow) I my desires screw from thee and direct Them and my thoughts to that sublime respect And conscience unto priesthood. 'Tis not need (The scarecrow unto mankind) that doth breed Wiser conclusions in me, since I know I've more to bear my charge than way to go; Or had I not, I'd stop the spreading itch Of craving more: so in conceit be rich; But 'tis the God of nature who intends And shapes my function for more glorious ends."" "
35,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Perhaps it was at this time too that Herrick wrote his _Farewell to Sack_, and although he returned both to sack and to poetry we should be wrong in imagining him as a ""blind mouth,"" using his office merely as a means of gain. He celebrated the births of Charles II and his brother in verse, perhaps with an eye to future royal favours, but no more than Chaucer's good parson does he seem to have ""run to London unto Seynte Poules"" in search of the seventeenth century equivalent for a chauntry, and many of his poems show him living the life of a contented country clergyman, sharing the contents of bin and cruse with his poor parishioners, and jotting down sermon-notes in verse. "
36,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"The great majority of Herrick's poems cannot be dated, and it is idle to enquire which were written before his ordination and which afterwards. His conception of religion was medieval in its sensuousness, and he probably repeated the stages of sin, repentance and renewed assurance with some facility. He lived with an old servant, Prudence Baldwin, the ""Prew"" of many of his poems; kept a spaniel named Tracy, and, so says tradition, a tame pig. When his parishioners annoyed him he seems to have comforted himself with epigrams on them; when they slumbered during one of his sermons the manuscript was suddenly hurled at them with a curse for their inattention. "
37,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"In the same year that Herrick was appointed to his country vicarage his mother died while living with her daughter, Mercy, the poet's dearest sister (see 818), then for some time married to John Wingfield of Brantham in Suffolk (see 590), by whom she had three sons and a daughter, also called Mercy. His eldest brother, Thomas, had been placed with a Mr. Massam, a merchant, but as early as 1610 had retired to live a country life in Leicestershire (see 106). He appears to have married a wife named Elizabeth, whose loss Herrick laments (see 72). Nicholas, the next brother was more adventurous. He had become a merchant trading to the Levant, and in this capacity had visited the Holy Land (see 1100). To his wife Susanna, daughter of William Salter, Herrick addresses two poems (522 and 977). There were three sons and four daughters in this family, and Herrick wrote a poem to one of the daughters, Bridget (562), and an elegy on another, Elizabeth (376). When Mrs. Herrick died the bulk of her property was left to the Wingfields, but William Herrick received a legacy of £100, with ten pounds apiece to his two children, and a ring of twenty shillings to his wife. Nicholas and Robert were only left twenty-shilling rings, and the administration of the will was entrusted to William Herrick and the Wingfields. The will may have been the result of a family arrangement, and we have no reason to believe that the unequal division gave rise to any ill-feeling. Herrick's address to ""his dying brother, Master William Herrick"" (186), shows abundant affection, and there is every reason to believe that it was addressed to the William who administered to Mrs. Herrick's will. "
38,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"While little nephews and nieces were springing up around him, Herrick remained unmarried, and frequently congratulates himself on his freedom from the yoke matrimonial. He imagined how he would bid farewell to his wife, if he had one (465), and wrote magnificent epithalamia for his friends, but lived and died a bachelor. When first civil troubles and then civil war cast a shadow over the land, it is not very easy to say how he viewed the contending parties. He was devoted to Charles and Henrietta Maria and the young Prince of Wales, and rejoiced at every Royalist success. Many also of his poems breathe the spirit of unquestioning loyalty, but in others he is less certain of kingly wisdom. Something, however, must be allowed for his evident habit of versifying any phrase or epigram which impressed him, and not all his poems need be regarded as expressions of his personal opinions. But with whatever doubts his loyalty was qualified, it was sufficiently obvious to procure his ejection from his living in 1648; and, making the best of his loss, he bade farewell to Dean Prior, shook the dust of ""loathed Devonshire"" off his feet, and returned gaily to London, where he appears to have discarded his clerical habit and to have been made abundantly welcome by his friends. "
39,LIFE OF HERRICK.,"Free from the cares of his incumbency, and free also from the restraints it imposed, Herrick's thoughts turned to the publication of his poems. As we have said, in his old Court-days these had found some circulation in manuscript, and in 1635 one of his fairy poems was printed, probably without his leave (see Appendix). In 1639 his poem (575) _The Apparition of his Mistress calling him to Elysium_ was licensed at Stationers' Hall under the title of _His Mistress' Shade_, and it was included the next year in an edition of Shakespeare's Poems (see Notes). On April 29, 1640, ""The severall poems written by Master Robert Herrick,"" were entered as to be published by Andrew Crook, but no trace of such a volume has been discovered, and it was only in 1648 that _Hesperides_ at length appeared. Two years later upwards of eighty of the poems in it were printed in the 1650 edition of _Witt's Recreations_, but a small number of these show considerable variations from the _Hesperides_ versions, and it is probable that they were printed from the poet's manuscript. Compilers of other miscellanies and song books laid Herrick under contribution, but, with the one exception of his contribution to the _Lacrymæ Musarum_ in 1649, no fresh production of his pen has been preserved, and we know nothing further of his life save that he returned to Dean Prior after the Restoration (August 24, 1662), and that according to the parish register ""Robert Herrick, Vicker, was buried y^e 15th day October, 1674."" "
42,NOTE TO SECOND EDITION.,"In this edition some trifling errors, which had crept into the text and the numeration of the poems, have been corrected, and many fresh illustrations of Herrick's reading added in the notes, which have elsewhere been slightly compressed to make room for them. Almost all of the new notes have been supplied from the manuscript collections of a veteran student of Herrick who placed himself in correspondence with me after the publication of my first edition. To my great regret I am not allowed to make my acknowledgments to him by name. "

49,PRINCE OF WALES.,"TO THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS AND MOST HOPEFUL PRINCE. CHARLES, PRINCE OF WALES. "
50,PRINCE OF WALES.,"Well may my book come forth like public day When such a light as you are leads the way, Who are my work's creator, and alone The flame of it, and the expansion. And look how all those heavenly lamps acquire Light from the sun, that inexhausted fire, So all my morn and evening stars from you Have their existence, and their influence too. Full is my book of glories; but all these By you become immortal substances. "
53,1. THE ARGUMENT OF HIS BOOK.,"I sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds and bowers, Of April, May, of June and July-flowers; I sing of May-poles, hock-carts, wassails, wakes, Of bridegrooms, brides and of their bridal cakes; I write of youth, of love, and have access By these to sing of cleanly wantonness; I sing of dews, of rains, and piece by piece Of balm, of oil, of spice and ambergris; I sing of times trans-shifting, and I write How roses first came red and lilies white; I write of groves, of twilights, and I sing The Court of Mab, and of the Fairy King; I write of hell; I sing (and ever shall) Of heaven, and hope to have it after all. "
54,1. THE ARGUMENT OF HIS BOOK.,"_Hock-cart_, the last cart from the harvest-field. _Wakes_, village festivals, properly on the dedication-day of a church. _Ambergris_, 'grey amber,' much used in perfumery. "
56,2. TO HIS MUSE.,"Whither, mad maiden, wilt thou roam? Far safer 'twere to stay at home, Where thou mayst sit and piping please The poor and private cottages, Since cotes and hamlets best agree With this thy meaner minstrelsy. There with the reed thou mayst express The shepherd's fleecy happiness, And with thy eclogues intermix Some smooth and harmless bucolics. There on a hillock thou mayst sing Unto a handsome shepherdling, Or to a girl, that keeps the neat, With breath more sweet than violet. There, there, perhaps, such lines as these May take the simple villages; But for the court, the country wit Is despicable unto it. Stay, then, at home, and do not go Or fly abroad to seek for woe. Contempts in courts and cities dwell, No critic haunts the poor man's cell, Where thou mayst hear thine own lines read By no one tongue there censured. That man's unwise will search for ill, And may prevent it, sitting still. "
58,3. TO HIS BOOK.,"While thou didst keep thy candour undefil'd, Dearly I lov'd thee as my first-born child, But when I saw thee wantonly to roam From house to house, and never stay at home, I brake my bonds of love, and bade thee go, Regardless whether well thou sped'st or no. On with thy fortunes then, whate'er they be: If good, I'll smile; if bad, I'll sigh for thee. "
60,4. ANOTHER.,"To read my book the virgin shy May blush while Brutus standeth by, But when he's gone, read through what's writ, And never stain a cheek for it. "
61,4. ANOTHER.,"_Brutus_, see Martial, xi. 16, quoted in Note at the end of the volume. "
63,7. TO HIS BOOK.,"Come thou not near those men who are like bread O'er-leaven'd, or like cheese o'er-renneted. "
65,8. WHEN HE WOULD HAVE HIS VERSES READ.,"In sober mornings, do not thou rehearse The holy incantation of a verse; But when that men have both well drunk and fed, Let my enchantments then be sung or read. When laurel spirts i'th' fire, and when the hearth Smiles to itself, and gilds the roof with mirth; When up the thyrse[C] is rais'd, and when the sound Of sacred orgies[D] flies, a round, a round. When the rose reigns, and locks with ointments shine, Let rigid Cato read these lines of mine. "
66,8. WHEN HE WOULD HAVE HIS VERSES READ.,"_Round_, a rustic dance. _Cato_, see Martial, x. 17, quoted in Note. "
67,8. WHEN HE WOULD HAVE HIS VERSES READ.,"[C] ""A javelin twined with ivy"" (Note in the original edition). "
70,9. UPON JULIA'S RECOVERY.,"Droop, droop no more, or hang the head, Ye roses almost withered; Now strength and newer purple get, Each here declining violet. O primroses! let this day be A resurrection unto ye; And to all flowers ally'd in blood, Or sworn to that sweet sisterhood: For health on Julia's cheek hath shed Claret and cream commingled; And those her lips do now appear As beams of coral, but more clear. "
73,10. TO SILVIA TO WED.,"Let us, though late, at last, my Silvia, wed, And loving lie in one devoted bed. Thy watch may stand, my minutes fly post-haste; No sound calls back the year that once is past. Then, sweetest Silvia, let's no longer stay; _True love, we know, precipitates delay._ Away with doubts, all scruples hence remove; _No man at one time can be wise and love._ "
75,11. THE PARLIAMENT OF ROSES TO JULIA.,"I dreamt the roses one time went To meet and sit in parliament; The place for these, and for the rest Of flowers, was thy spotless breast, Over the which a state was drawn Of tiffanie or cobweb lawn. Then in that parly all those powers Voted the rose the queen of flowers; But so as that herself should be The maid of honour unto thee. "
78,12. NO BASHFULNESS IN BEGGING.,"To get thine ends, lay bashfulness aside; _Who fears to ask doth teach to be deny'd._ "
80,13. THE FROZEN HEART.,"I freeze, I freeze, and nothing dwells In me but snow and icicles. For pity's sake, give your advice, To melt this snow and thaw this ice. I'll drink down flames; but if so be Nothing but love can supple me, I'll rather keep this frost and snow Than to be thaw'd or heated so. "
82,14. TO PERILLA.,"Ah, my Perilla! dost thou grieve to see Me, day by day, to steal away from thee? Age calls me hence, and my grey hairs bid come, And haste away to mine eternal home; 'Twill not be long, Perilla, after this, That I must give thee the supremest kiss. Dead when I am, first cast in salt, and bring Part of the cream from that religious spring; With which, Perilla, wash my hands and feet; That done, then wind me in that very sheet Which wrapt thy smooth limbs when thou didst implore The gods' protection but the night before. Follow me weeping to my turf, and there Let fall a primrose, and with it a tear: Then, lastly, let some weekly-strewings be Devoted to the memory of me: Then shall my ghost not walk about, but keep Still in the cool and silent shades of sleep. "
83,14. TO PERILLA.,"_Weekly strewings_, _i.e._, of flowers on his grave. _First cast in salt_, cp. 769. "
85,15. A SONG TO THE MASKERS.,"Come down and dance ye in the toil Of pleasures to a heat; But if to moisture, let the oil Of roses be your sweat. "
86,15. A SONG TO THE MASKERS.,"Not only to yourselves assume These sweets, but let them fly From this to that, and so perfume E'en all the standers by; "
87,15. A SONG TO THE MASKERS.,"As goddess Isis, when she went Or glided through the street, Made all that touched her, with her scent, And whom she touched, turn sweet. "
89,16. TO PERENNA.,"When I thy parts run o'er, I can't espy In any one the least indecency; But every line and limb diffused thence A fair and unfamiliar excellence: So that the more I look the more I prove There's still more cause why I the more should love. "
92,17. TREASON.,The seeds of treason choke up as they spring: _He acts the crime that gives it cherishing_. 
94,18. TWO THINGS ODIOUS.,"Two of a thousand things are disallow'd: A lying rich man, and a poor man proud. "
96,19. TO HIS MISTRESSES.,"Help me! help me! now I call To my pretty witchcrafts all; Old I am, and cannot do That I was accustomed to. Bring your magics, spells, and charms, To enflesh my thighs and arms. Is there no way to beget In my limbs their former heat? Æson had, as poets feign, Baths that made him young again: Find that medicine, if you can, For your dry decrepit man Who would fain his strength renew, Were it but to pleasure you. "
99,20. THE WOUNDED HEART.,"Come bring your sampler, and with art Draw in't a wounded heart And dropping here and there: Not that I think that any dart Can make yours bleed a tear, Or pierce it anywhere; Yet do it to this end: that I May by This secret see, Though you can make That heart to bleed, yours ne'er will ache For me. "
101,21. NO LOATHSOMENESS IN LOVE.,"What I fancy I approve, _No dislike there is in love_. Be my mistress short or tall, And distorted therewithal: Be she likewise one of those That an acre hath of nose: Be her forehead and her eyes Full of incongruities: Be her cheeks so shallow too As to show her tongue wag through; Be her lips ill hung or set, And her grinders black as jet: Has she thin hair, hath she none, She's to me a paragon. "
103,22. TO ANTHEA.,"If, dear Anthea, my hard fate it be To live some few sad hours after thee, Thy sacred corse with odours I will burn, And with my laurel crown thy golden urn. Then holding up there such religious things As were, time past, thy holy filletings, Near to thy reverend pitcher I will fall Down dead for grief, and end my woes withal: So three in one small plat of ground shall lie-- Anthea, Herrick, and his poetry. "
105,23. THE WEEPING CHERRY.,"I saw a cherry weep, and why? Why wept it? but for shame Because my Julia's lip was by, And did out-red the same. But, pretty fondling, let not fall A tear at all for that: Which rubies, corals, scarlets, all For tincture wonder at. "
107,24. SOFT MUSIC.,The mellow touch of music most doth wound The soul when it doth rather sigh than sound. 
109,25. THE DIFFERENCE BETWIXT KINGS AND SUBJECTS.,'Twixt kings and subjects there's this mighty odds: Subjects are taught by men; kings by the gods. 
111,26. HIS ANSWER TO A QUESTION.,"Some would know Why I so Long still do tarry, And ask why Here that I Live and not marry. Thus I those Do oppose: What man would be here Slave to thrall, If at all He could live free here? "
113,27. UPON JULIA'S FALL.,"Julia was careless, and withal She rather took than got a fall, The wanton ambler chanc'd to see Part of her legs' sincerity: And ravish'd thus, it came to pass, The nag (like to the prophet's ass) Began to speak, and would have been A-telling what rare sights he'd seen: And had told all; but did refrain Because his tongue was tied again. "
115,28. EXPENSES EXHAUST.,"Live with a thrifty, not a needy fate; _Small shots paid often waste a vast estate_. "
118,"29. LOVE, WHAT IT IS.",Love is a circle that doth restless move In the same sweet eternity of love. 
120,30. PRESENCE AND ABSENCE.,"When what is lov'd is present, love doth spring; But being absent, love lies languishing. "
122,31. NO SPOUSE BUT A SISTER.,"A bachelor I will Live as I have liv'd still, And never take a wife To crucify my life; But this I'll tell ye too, What now I mean to do: A sister (in the stead Of wife) about I'll lead; Which I will keep embrac'd, And kiss, but yet be chaste. "
124,32. THE POMANDER BRACELET.,"To me my Julia lately sent A bracelet richly redolent: The beads I kissed, but most lov'd her That did perfume the pomander. "
127,33. THE SHOE-TYING.,"Anthea bade me tie her shoe; I did; and kissed the instep too: And would have kissed unto her knee, Had not her blush rebuked me. "
129,34. THE CARCANET.,"Instead of orient pearls of jet I sent my love a carcanet; About her spotless neck she knit The lace, to honour me or it: Then think how rapt was I to see My jet t'enthral such ivory. "
130,34. THE CARCANET.,"_Carcanet_, necklace. _Lace_, any kind of girdle; used here for the necklace. "
132,35. HIS SAILING FROM JULIA.,"When that day comes, whose evening says I'm gone Unto that watery desolation, Devoutly to thy closet-gods then pray That my wing'd ship may meet no remora. Those deities which circum-walk the seas, And look upon our dreadful passages, Will from all dangers re-deliver me For one drink-offering poured out by thee. Mercy and truth live with thee! and forbear (In my short absence) to unsluice a tear; But yet for love's sake let thy lips do this, Give my dead picture one engendering kiss: Work that to life, and let me ever dwell In thy remembrance, Julia. So farewell. "
133,35. HIS SAILING FROM JULIA.,"_Closet-gods_, the Roman Lares. _Remora_, the sea Lamprey or suckstone, believed to check the course of ships by clinging to their keels. "
134,"36. HOW THE WALL-FLOWER CAME FIRST, AND WHY SO CALLED.","36. HOW THE WALL-FLOWER CAME FIRST, AND WHY SO CALLED. "
135,"36. HOW THE WALL-FLOWER CAME FIRST, AND WHY SO CALLED.","Why this flower is now call'd so, List, sweet maids, and you shall know. Understand, this firstling was Once a brisk and bonnie lass, Kept as close as Danaë was: Who a sprightly springall lov'd, And to have it fully prov'd, Up she got upon a wall, Tempting down to slide withal: But the silken twist untied, So she fell, and, bruis'd, she died. Love, in pity of the deed, And her loving-luckless speed, Turn'd her to this plant we call Now _the flower of the wall_. "
138,37. WHY FLOWERS CHANGE COLOUR.,"These fresh beauties (we can prove) Once were virgins sick of love. Turn'd to flowers,--still in some Colours go and colours come. "
139,38. TO HIS MISTRESS OBJECTING TO HIM NEITHER TOYING OR TALKING.,38. TO HIS MISTRESS OBJECTING TO HIM NEITHER TOYING OR TALKING. 
140,38. TO HIS MISTRESS OBJECTING TO HIM NEITHER TOYING OR TALKING.,"You say I love not, 'cause I do not play Still with your curls, and kiss the time away. You blame me too, because I can't devise Some sport to please those babies in your eyes: By love's religion, I must here confess it, The most I love when I the least express it. _Small griefs find tongues_: full casks are ever found To give (if any, yet) but little sound. _Deep waters noiseless are_; and this we know, _That chiding streams betray small depth below_. So, when love speechless is, she doth express A depth in love and that depth bottomless. Now, since my love is tongueless, know me such Who speak but little 'cause I love so much. "
143,39. UPON THE LOSS OF HIS MISTRESSES.,"I have lost, and lately, these Many dainty mistresses: Stately Julia, prime of all: Sappho next, a principal: Smooth Anthea for a skin White, and heaven-like crystalline: Sweet Electra, and the choice Myrrha for the lute and voice: Next Corinna, for her wit, And the graceful use of it: With Perilla: all are gone; Only Herrick's left alone For to number sorrow by Their departures hence, and die. "
145,40. THE DREAM.,"Methought last night Love in an anger came And brought a rod, so whipt me with the same; Myrtle the twigs were, merely to imply Love strikes, but 'tis with gentle cruelty. Patient I was: Love pitiful grew then And strok'd the stripes, and I was whole again. Thus, like a bee, Love gentle still doth bring Honey to salve where he before did sting. "
147,42. TO LOVE.,"I'm free from thee; and thou no more shalt hear My puling pipe to beat against thine ear. Farewell my shackles, though of pearl they be; Such precious thraldom ne'er shall fetter me. He loves his bonds who, when the first are broke, Submits his neck unto a second yoke. "
149,43. ON HIMSELF.,"Young I was, but now am old, But I am not yet grown cold; I can play, and I can twine 'Bout a virgin like a vine: In her lap too I can lie Melting, and in fancy die; And return to life if she Claps my cheek, or kisseth me: Thus, and thus it now appears That our love outlasts our years. "
151,44. LOVE'S PLAY AT PUSH-PIN.,"Love and myself, believe me, on a day At childish push-pin, for our sport, did play; I put, he pushed, and, heedless of my skin, Love pricked my finger with a golden pin; Since which it festers so that I can prove 'Twas but a trick to poison me with love: Little the wound was, greater was the smart, The finger bled, but burnt was all my heart. "
152,44. LOVE'S PLAY AT PUSH-PIN.,"_Push-pin_, a game in which pins are pushed with an endeavor to cross them. "
154,45. THE ROSARY.,"One ask'd me where the roses grew: I bade him not go seek, But forthwith bade my Julia show A bud in either cheek. "
156,46. UPON CUPID.,"Old wives have often told how they Saw Cupid bitten by a flea; And thereupon, in tears half drown'd, He cried aloud: Help, help the wound! He wept, he sobb'd, he call'd to some To bring him lint and balsamum, To make a tent, and put it in Where the stiletto pierced the skin; Which, being done, the fretful pain Assuaged, and he was well again. "
159,"47. THE PARCÆ; OR, THREE DAINTY DESTINIES: THE ARMILLET.","Three lovely sisters working were, As they were closely set, Of soft and dainty maidenhair A curious armillet. I, smiling, asked them what they did, Fair Destinies all three, Who told me they had drawn a thread Of life, and 'twas for me. They show'd me then how fine 'twas spun, And I reply'd thereto,-- ""I care not now how soon 'tis done, Or cut, if cut by you"". "
161,48. SORROWS SUCCEED.,"When one is past, another care we have: _Thus woe succeeds a woe, as wave a wave_. "
163,49. CHERRY-PIT.,"Julia and I did lately sit Playing for sport at cherry-pit: She threw; I cast; and, having thrown, I got the pit, and she the stone. "
164,49. CHERRY-PIT.,"_Cherry-pit_, a game in which cherry-stones were pitched into a small hole. "
166,50. TO ROBIN REDBREAST.,"Laid out for dead, let thy last kindness be With leaves and moss-work for to cover me: And while the wood-nymphs my cold corpse inter, Sing thou my dirge, sweet-warbling chorister! For epitaph, in foliage, next write this: _Here, here the tomb of Robin Herrick is_. "
168,51. DISCONTENTS IN DEVON.,"More discontents I never had Since I was born than here, Where I have been, and still am sad, In this dull Devonshire; Yet, justly too, I must confess I ne'er invented such Ennobled numbers for the press, Than where I loathed so much. "
170,52. TO HIS PATERNAL COUNTRY.,"O earth! earth! earth! hear thou my voice, and be Loving and gentle for to cover me: Banish'd from thee I live, ne'er to return, Unless thou giv'st my small remains an urn. "
172,53. CHERRY-RIPE.,"Cherry-ripe, ripe, ripe, I cry, Full and fair ones; come and buy. If so be you ask me where They do grow, I answer: There, Where my Julia's lips do smile; There's the land, or cherry-isle, Whose plantations fully show All the year where cherries grow. "
174,54. TO HIS MISTRESSES.,"Put on your silks, and piece by piece Give them the scent of ambergris; And for your breaths, too, let them smell Ambrosia-like, or nectarel; While other gums their sweets perspire, By your own jewels set on fire. "
176,55. TO ANTHEA.,"Now is the time, when all the lights wax dim; And thou, Anthea, must withdraw from him Who was thy servant. Dearest, bury me Under that Holy-oak or Gospel-tree, Where, though thou see'st not, thou may'st think upon Me, when thou yearly go'st procession; Or, for mine honour, lay me in that tomb In which thy sacred relics shall have room. For my embalming, sweetest, there will be No spices wanting when I'm laid by thee. "
177,55. TO ANTHEA.,"_Holy oak_, the oak under which the minister read the Gospel in the procession round the parish bounds in Rogation week. "
179,56. THE VISION TO ELECTRA.,"I dreamed we both were in a bed Of roses, almost smothered: The warmth and sweetness had me there Made lovingly familiar, But that I heard thy sweet breath say, Faults done by night will blush by day. I kissed thee, panting, and, I call Night to the record! that was all. But, ah! if empty dreams so please, Love give me more such nights as these. "
181,57. DREAMS.,"Here we are all by day; by night we're hurl'd By dreams, each one into a sev'ral world. "
183,58. AMBITION.,In man ambition is the common'st thing; Each one by nature loves to be a king. 
185,59. HIS REQUEST TO JULIA.,"Julia, if I chance to die Ere I print my poetry, I most humbly thee desire To commit it to the fire: Better 'twere my book were dead Than to live not perfected. "
187,60. MONEY GETS THE MASTERY.,"Fight thou with shafts of silver and o'ercome, When no force else can get the masterdom. "
189,61. THE SCARE-FIRE.,"Water, water I desire, Here's a house of flesh on fire; Ope the fountains and the springs, And come all to bucketings: What ye cannot quench pull down; Spoil a house to save a town: Better 'tis that one should fall, Than by one to hazard all. "
192,"62. UPON SILVIA, A MISTRESS.","When some shall say, Fair once my Silvia was, Thou wilt complain, False now's thy looking-glass, Which renders that quite tarnished which was green, And priceless now what peerless once had been. Upon thy form more wrinkles yet will fall, And, coming down, shall make no noise at all. "
195,"63. CHEERFULNESS IN CHARITY; OR, THE SWEET SACRIFICE.","'Tis not a thousand bullocks' thighs Can please those heav'nly deities, If the vower don't express In his offering cheerfulness. "
197,65. SWEETNESS IN SACRIFICE.,'Tis not greatness they require To be offer'd up by fire; But 'tis sweetness that doth please Those _Eternal Essences_. 
199,66. STEAM IN SACRIFICE.,"If meat the gods give, I the steam High-towering will devote to them, Whose easy natures like it well, If we the roast have, they the smell. "
201,67. UPON JULIA'S VOICE.,"So smooth, so sweet, so silv'ry is thy voice, As, could they hear, the damn'd would make no noise, But listen to thee, walking in thy chamber, Melting melodious words to lutes of amber. "
202,67. UPON JULIA'S VOICE.,"_Amber_, used here merely for any rich material: cp. ""Treading on amber with their silver feet"". "
204,68. AGAIN.,"When I thy singing next shall hear, I'll wish I might turn all to ear To drink in notes and numbers such As blessed souls can't hear too much; Then melted down, there let me lie Entranc'd and lost confusedly, And, by thy music stricken mute, Die and be turn'd into a lute. "
206,69. ALL THINGS DECAY AND DIE.,"_All things decay with time_: the forest sees The growth and downfall of her aged trees; That timber tall, which threescore lusters stood The proud dictator of the state-like wood,-- I mean (the sovereign of all plants) the oak-- Droops, dies, and falls without the cleaver's stroke. "
209,70. THE SUCCESSION OF THE FOUR SWEET MONTHS.,"First, April, she with mellow showers Opens the way for early flowers; Then after her comes smiling May, In a more rich and sweet array; Next enters June, and brings us more Gems than those two that went before: Then (lastly) July comes, and she More wealth brings in than all those three. "
211,71. NO SHIPWRECK OF VIRTUE. TO A FRIEND.,"Thou sail'st with others in this Argus here; Nor wreck or bulging thou hast cause to fear; But trust to this, my noble passenger; Who swims with virtue, he shall still be sure (Ulysses-like) all tempests to endure, And 'midst a thousand gulfs to be secure. "
214,"72. UPON HIS SISTER-IN-LAW, MISTRESS ELIZABETH HERRICK.","First, for effusions due unto the dead, My solemn vows have here accomplished: Next, how I love thee, that my grief must tell, Wherein thou liv'st for ever. Dear, farewell. "
217,73. OF LOVE. A SONNET.,"How love came in I do not know, Whether by the eye, or ear, or no; Or whether with the soul it came (At first) infused with the same; Whether in part 'tis here or there, Or, like the soul, whole everywhere, This troubles me: but I as well As any other this can tell: That when from hence she does depart The outlet then is from the heart. "
219,74. TO ANTHEA.,"Ah, my Anthea! Must my heart still break? (_Love makes me write, what shame forbids to speak_.) Give me a kiss, and to that kiss a score; Then to that twenty add a hundred more: A thousand to that hundred: so kiss on, To make that thousand up a million. Treble that million, and when that is done Let's kiss afresh, as when we first begun. But yet, though love likes well such scenes as these, There is an act that will more fully please: Kissing and glancing, soothing, all make way But to the acting of this private play: Name it I would; but, being blushing red, The rest I'll speak when we meet both in bed. "
220,"75. THE ROCK OF RUBIES, AND THE QUARRY OF PEARLS.","75. THE ROCK OF RUBIES, AND THE QUARRY OF PEARLS. "
221,"75. THE ROCK OF RUBIES, AND THE QUARRY OF PEARLS.","Some ask'd me where the rubies grew, And nothing I did say: But with my finger pointed to The lips of Julia. Some ask'd how pearls did grow, and where; Then spoke I to my girl, To part her lips, and show'd them there The quarrelets of Pearl. "
224,76. CONFORMITY.,"Conformity was ever known A foe to dissolution: Nor can we that a ruin call, Whose crack gives crushing unto all. "
225,"77. TO THE KING, UPON HIS COMING WITH HIS ARMY INTO THE WEST.","77. TO THE KING, UPON HIS COMING WITH HIS ARMY INTO THE WEST. "
226,"77. TO THE KING, UPON HIS COMING WITH HIS ARMY INTO THE WEST.","Welcome, most welcome to our vows and us, Most great and universal genius! The drooping West, which hitherto has stood As one in long-lamented widowhood, Looks like a bride now, or a bed of flowers Newly refresh'd both by the sun and showers. War, which before was horrid, now appears Lovely in you, brave prince of cavaliers! A deal of courage in each bosom springs By your access, O you the best of kings! Ride on with all white omens; so that where Your standard's up, we fix a conquest there. "
228,78. UPON ROSES.,"Under a lawn, than skies more clear, Some ruffled roses nestling were: And, snugging there, they seem'd to lie As in a flowery nunnery: They blush'd, and look'd more fresh than flowers Quicken'd of late by pearly showers, And all because they were possess'd But of the heat of Julia's breast: Which, as a warm and moisten'd spring, Gave them their ever-flourishing. "

230,79. TO THE KING AND QUEEN UPON THEIR UNHAPPY DISTANCES.,"Woe, woe to them, who, by a ball of strife, Do, and have parted here a man and wife: CHARLES the best husband, while MARIA strives To be, and is, the very best of wives, Like streams, you are divorc'd; but 'twill come when These eyes of mine shall see you mix again. Thus speaks the oak here; C. and M. shall meet, Treading on amber, with their silver-feet, Nor will't be long ere this accomplish'd be: The words found true, C. M., remember me. "

237,"81. THE CHEAT OF CUPID; OR, THE UNGENTLE GUEST.","For I a boy am, who By moonless nights have swerved; And all with show'rs wet through, And e'en with cold half starved. "
238,"81. THE CHEAT OF CUPID; OR, THE UNGENTLE GUEST.","I pitiful arose, And soon a taper lighted; And did myself disclose Unto the lad benighted. "
239,"81. THE CHEAT OF CUPID; OR, THE UNGENTLE GUEST.","I saw he had a bow And wings, too, which did shiver; And, looking down below, I spied he had a quiver. "

243,"81. THE CHEAT OF CUPID; OR, THE UNGENTLE GUEST.","Then, laughing loud, he flew Away, and thus said, flying: Adieu, mine host, adieu, I'll leave thy heart a-dying. "
245,82. TO THE REVEREND SHADE OF HIS RELIGIOUS FATHER.,"That for seven lusters I did never come To do the rites to thy religious tomb; That neither hair was cut, or true tears shed By me, o'er thee, as justments to the dead, Forgive, forgive me; since I did not know Whether thy bones had here their rest or no, But now 'tis known, behold! behold, I bring Unto thy ghost th' effused offering: And look what smallage, night-shade, cypress, yew, Unto the shades have been, or now are due, Here I devote; and something more than so; I come to pay a debt of birth I owe. Thou gav'st me life, but mortal; for that one Favour I'll make full satisfaction; For my life mortal rise from out thy hearse. And take a life immortal from my verse. "
246,82. TO THE REVEREND SHADE OF HIS RELIGIOUS FATHER.,"_Seven lusters_, five and thirty years. _Hair was cut_, according to the Greek custom. _Justments_, dues. _Smallage_, water parsley. "
248,83. DELIGHT IN DISORDER.,"A sweet disorder in the dress Kindles in clothes a wantonness: A lawn about the shoulders thrown Into a fine distraction: An erring lace which here and there Enthralls the crimson stomacher: A cuff neglectful, and thereby Ribbons to flow confusedly: A winning wave, deserving note, In the tempestuous petticoat: A careless shoe-string, in whose tie I see a wild civility: Do more bewitch me than when art Is too precise in every part. "
250,84. TO HIS MUSE.,"Were I to give thee baptism, I would choose To christen thee, the bride, the bashful Muse, Or Muse of roses: since that name does fit Best with those virgin-verses thou hast writ: Which are so clean, so chaste, as none may fear Cato the censor, should he scan each here. "
252,85. UPON LOVE.,"Love scorch'd my finger, but did spare The burning of my heart; To signify in love my share Should be a little part. "
253,85. UPON LOVE.,"Little I love; but if that he Would but that heat recall; That joint to ashes burnt should be,[E] Ere I would love at all. "

256,"86. TO DEAN BOURN, A RUDE RIVER IN DEVON, BY WHICH SOMETIMES HE LIVED.","Dean Bourn, farewell; I never look to see Dean, or thy watery[F] incivility. Thy rocky bottom, that doth tear thy streams And makes them frantic even to all extremes, To my content I never should behold, Were thy streams silver, or thy rocks all gold. Rocky thou art, and rocky we discover Thy men, and rocky are thy ways all over. O men, O manners, now and ever known To be a rocky generation! A people currish, churlish as the seas, And rude almost as rudest savages, With whom I did, and may re-sojourn when Rocks turn to rivers, rivers turn to men. "

First, for thy queenship, on thy head is set Of flowers a sweet commingled coronet: About thy neck a carcanet is bound, Made of the ruby, pearl and diamond: A golden ring that shines upon thy thumb: About thy wrist, the rich dardanium.[G] Between thy breasts (than down of swans more white) There plays the sapphire with the chrysolite. No part besides must of thyself be known, But by the topaz, opal, chalcedon. "

285,95. TO THE GENEROUS READER.,"See and not see, and if thou chance t'espy Some aberrations in my poetry, Wink at small faults; the greater, ne'ertheless, Hide, and with them their father's nakedness. Let's do our best, our watch and ward to keep; Homer himself, in a long work, may sleep. "
287,96. TO CRITICS.,"I'll write, because I'll give You critics means to live; For should I not supply The cause, th' effect would die. "
289,97. DUTY TO TYRANTS.,"Good princes must be pray'd for; for the bad They must be borne with, and in rev'rence had. Do they first pill thee, next pluck off thy skin? _Good children kiss the rods that punish sin_. Touch not the tyrant; let the gods alone To strike him dead that but usurps a throne. "

BEING ONCE BLIND, HIS REQUEST TO BIANCA.","When age or chance has made me blind, So that the path I cannot find, And when my falls and stumblings are More than the stones i' th' street by far, Go thou afore, and I shall well Follow thy perfumes by the smell; Or be my guide, and I shall be Led by some light that flows from thee. Thus held or led by thee, I shall In ways confus'd nor slip or fall. "

I do beseech thee ere we part, If merciful as fair thou art, Or else desir'st that maids should tell Thy pity by love's chronicle, O Dianeme, rather kill Me, than to make me languish still! 'Tis cruelty in thee to th' height Thus, thus to wound, not kill outright; Yet there's a way found, if you please, By sudden death to give me ease; And thus devis'd, do thou but this-- Bequeath to me one parting kiss, So sup'rabundant joy shall be The executioner of me.

310,"106. A COUNTRY-LIFE: TO HIS BROTHER, MR. THO. HERRICK.","Thrice, and above, bless'd, my soul's half, art thou In thy both last and better vow: Could'st leave the city, for exchange, to see The country's sweet simplicity: And it to know and practise, with intent To grow the sooner innocent By studying to know virtue, and to aim More at her nature than her name. The last is but the least; the first doth tell Ways less to live than to live well: And both are known to thee, who now can'st live Led by thy conscience; to give Justice to soon-pleased nature; and to show Wisdom and she together go And keep one centre: this with that conspires To teach man to confine desires And know that riches have their proper stint In the contented mind, not mint: And can'st instruct that those who have the itch Of craving more are never rich. These things thou know'st to th' height, and dost prevent That plague; because thou art content With that heav'n gave thee with a wary hand, More blessed in thy brass than land, To keep cheap nature even and upright; To cool, not cocker appetite. Thus thou canst tersely live to satisfy The belly chiefly, not the eye; Keeping the barking stomach wisely quiet, Less with a neat than needful diet. But that which most makes sweet thy country life Is the fruition of a wife: Whom, stars consenting with thy fate, thou hast Got not so beautiful as chaste: By whose warm side thou dost securely sleep, While love the sentinel doth keep, With those deeds done by day, which ne'er affright Thy silken slumbers in the night. Nor has the darkness power to usher in Fear to those sheets that know no sin; But still thy wife, by chaste intentions led, Gives thee each night a maidenhead. The damask'd meadows and the pebbly streams Sweeten and make soft your dreams: The purling springs, groves, birds, and well-weav'd bowers, With fields enamelled with flowers, Present their shapes; while fantasy discloses Millions of lilies mix'd with roses. Then dream ye hear the lamb by many a bleat Woo'd to come suck the milky teat: While Faunus in the vision comes to keep From rav'ning wolves the fleecy sheep. With thousand such enchanting dreams, that meet To make sleep not so sound as sweet: Nor can these figures so thy rest endear As not to rise when Chanticlere Warns the last watch; but with the dawn dost rise To work, but first to sacrifice; Making thy peace with heav'n, for some late fault, With holy-meal and spirting-salt. Which done, thy painful thumb this sentence tells us, _Jove for our labour all things sells us_. Nor are thy daily and devout affairs Attended with those desp'rate cares Th' industrious merchant has; who, for to find Gold, runneth to the Western Inde, And back again, tortured with fears, doth fly, Untaught to suffer poverty. But thou at home, bless'd with securest ease, Sitt'st, and believ'st that there be seas And watery dangers; while thy whiter hap But sees these things within thy map. And viewing them with a more safe survey Mak'st easy fear unto thee say,-- _""A heart thrice wall'd with oak and brass that man Had, first durst plough the ocean""_. But thou at home, without or tide or gale, Can'st in thy map securely sail: Seeing those painted countries, and so guess By those fine shades their substances: And, from thy compass taking small advice, Buy'st travel at the lowest price. Nor are thine ears so deaf but thou canst hear, Far more with wonder than with fear, Fame tell of states, of countries, courts, and kings, And believe there be such things: When of these truths thy happier knowledge lies More in thine ears than in thine eyes. And when thou hear'st by that too true report Vice rules the most or all at court, Thy pious wishes are, though thou not there, Virtue had, and mov'd her sphere. But thou liv'st fearless; and thy face ne'er shows Fortune when she comes or goes, But with thy equal thoughts prepared dost stand, To take her by the either hand; Nor car'st which comes the first, the foul or fair: _A wise man ev'ry way lies square_, And, like a surly oak with storms perplex'd, Grows still the stronger, strongly vex'd. Be so, bold spirit; stand centre-like, unmov'd; And be not only thought, but prov'd To be what I report thee; and inure Thyself, if want comes to endure: And so thou dost, for thy desires are Confin'd to live with private lar: Not curious whether appetite be fed Or with the first or second bread, Who keep'st no proud mouth for delicious cates: Hunger makes coarse meats delicates. Canst, and unurg'd, forsake that larded fare, Which art, not nature, makes so rare, To taste boil'd nettles, colworts, beets, and eat These and sour herbs as dainty meat, While soft opinion makes thy Genius say, _Content makes all ambrosia_. Nor is it that thou keep'st this stricter size So much for want as exercise: To numb the sense of dearth, which should sin haste it, Thou might'st but only see't, not taste it. Yet can thy humble roof maintain a choir Of singing crickets by the fire: And the brisk mouse may feast herself with crumbs Till that the green-eyed kitling comes, Then to her cabin blest she can escape The sudden danger of a rape: And thus thy little well-kept stock doth prove _Wealth cannot make a life, but love_. Nor art thou so close-handed but canst spend, Counsel concurring with the end, As well as spare, still conning o'er this theme, To shun the first and last extreme. Ordaining that thy small stock find no breach, Or to exceed thy tether's reach: But to live round, and close, and wisely true To thine own self, and known to few. Thus let thy rural sanctuary be Elysium to thy wife and thee; There to disport yourselves with golden measure: _For seldom use commends the pleasure_. Live, and live blest, thrice happy pair; let breath, But lost to one, be the other's death. And as there is one love, one faith, one troth, Be so one death, one grave to both. Till when, in such assurance live ye may, Nor fear or wish your dying day. "

Then, for an easy fancy, place A burling iron for his face: Next, make his cheeks with breath to swell, And for to speak, if possible: But do not so, for fear lest he Should by his breathing, poison thee.

Sighs numberless he cast about, And, all his tapers thus put out, His head upon his hand he laid, And sobbing deeply, thus he said: ""Ah, cruel sea,"" and, looking on't, Wept as he'd drown the Hellespont.

Thou did'st not mind it; though thou then might'st see Me turn'd to tears; yet did'st not weep for me. 'Tis true, I kiss'd thee; but I could not hear Thee spend a sigh t'accompany my tear. Methought 'twas strange that thou so hard should'st prove, Whose heart, whose hand, whose every part spake love. Prithee, lest maids should censure thee, but say Thou shed'st one tear, whenas I went away; And that will please me somewhat: though I know, And Love will swear't, my dearest did not so. "

355,127. THE HOUR-GLASS.,"That hour-glass which there you see With water fill'd, sirs, credit me, The humour was, as I have read, But lovers' tears incrystalled. Which, as they drop by drop do pass From th' upper to the under-glass, Do in a trickling manner tell, By many a watery syllable, That lovers' tears in lifetime shed Do restless run when they are dead.

358,128. HIS FAREWELL TO SACK.,"Farewell thou thing, time past so known, so dear To me as blood to life and spirit; near, Nay, thou more near than kindred, friend, man, wife, Male to the female, soul to body; life To quick action, or the warm soft side Of the resigning, yet resisting bride. The kiss of virgins, first fruits of the bed, Soft speech, smooth touch, the lips, the maidenhead: These and a thousand sweets could never be So near or dear as thou wast once to me. O thou, the drink of gods and angels! wine That scatter'st spirit and lust, whose purest shine More radiant than the summer's sunbeams shows; Each way illustrious, brave, and like to those Comets we see by night, whose shagg'd portents Foretell the coming of some dire events, Or some full flame which with a pride aspires, Throwing about his wild and active fires; 'Tis thou, above nectar, O divinest soul! Eternal in thyself, that can'st control That which subverts whole nature, grief and care, Vexation of the mind, and damn'd despair. 'Tis thou alone who, with thy mystic fan, Work'st more than wisdom, art, or nature can To rouse the sacred madness and awake The frost-bound blood and spirits, and to make Them frantic with thy raptures flashing through The soul like lightning, and as active too. 'Tis not Apollo can, or those thrice three Castalian sisters, sing, if wanting thee. Horace, Anacreon, both had lost their fame, Had'st thou not fill'd them with thy fire and flame. Phœbean splendour! and thou, Thespian spring! Of which sweet swans must drink before they sing Their true-pac'd numbers and their holy lays, Which makes them worthy cedar and the bays. But why, why longer do I gaze upon Thee with the eye of admiration? Since I must leave thee, and enforc'd must say To all thy witching beauties, Go, away. But if thy whimpering looks do ask me why, Then know that nature bids thee go, not I. 'Tis her erroneous self has made a brain Uncapable of such a sovereign As is thy powerful self. Prithee not smile, Or smile more inly, lest thy looks beguile My vows denounc'd in zeal, which thus much show thee That I have sworn but by thy looks to know thee. Let others drink thee freely, and desire Thee and their lips espous'd, while I admire And love thee, but not taste thee. Let my muse Fail of thy former helps, and only use Her inadult'rate strength: what's done by me Hereafter shall smell of the lamp, not thee. "

Alas for pity! and for us Most innocent, and injured thus! Had we kept close, or played within, Suspicion now had been the sin, And shame had followed long ere this, T' have plagued what now unpunished is. But we, as fearless of the sun, As faultless, will not wish undone What now is done, since _where no sin Unbolts the door, no shame comes in_. Then, comely and most fragrant maid, Be you more wary than afraid Of these reports, because you see The fairest most suspected be. The common forms have no one eye Or ear of burning jealousy To follow them: but chiefly where Love makes the cheek and chin a sphere To dance and play in, trust me, there Suspicion questions every hair. Come, you are fair, and should be seen While you are in your sprightful green: And what though you had been embraced By me--were you for that unchaste? No, no! no more than is yond' moon Which, shining in her perfect noon, In all that great and glorious light, Continues cold as is the night.

A silver bow, with green silk strung, Down from her comely shoulders hung: And as she stood, the wanton air Dangled the ringlets of her hair. Her legs were such Diana shows When, tucked up, she a-hunting goes; With buskins shortened to descry The happy dawning of her thigh: Which when I saw, I made access To kiss that tempting nakedness: But she forbade me with a wand Of myrtle she had in her hand: And, chiding me, said: Hence, remove, Herrick, thou art too coarse to love.

So you, my lord, though you have now your stay, Your night, your prison, and your ebb, you may Spring up afresh, when all these mists are spent, And star-like, once more gild our firmament. Let but that mighty Cæsar speak, and then All bolts, all bars, all gates shall cleave; as when That earthquake shook the house, and gave the stout Apostles way, unshackled, to go out. This, as I wish for, so I hope to see; Though you, my lord, have been unkind to me, To wound my heart, and never to apply, When you had power, the meanest remedy. Well, though my grief by you was gall'd the more, Yet I bring balm and oil to heal your sore. "

Then, away; come, Hymen, guide To the bed the bashful bride. "
409,VIII.,"And now the yellow veil at last Over her fragrant cheek is cast. Now seems she to express A bashful willingness: Showing a heart consenting, As with a will repenting. Then gently lead her on With wise suspicion; For that, matrons say, a measure Of that passion sweetens pleasure. "
411,IX.,"You, you that be of her nearest kin, Now o'er the threshold force her in. But to avert the worst Let her her fillets first Knit to the posts, this point Remembering, to anoint The sides, for 'tis a charm Strong against future harm; And the evil deads, the which There was hidden by the witch. "
413,X.,"O Venus! thou to whom is known The best way how to loose the zone Of virgins, tell the maid She need not be afraid, And bid the youth apply Close kisses if she cry, And charge he not forbears Her though she woo with tears. Tell them now they must adventure, Since that love and night bid enter. "
415,XI.,"No fatal owl the bedstead keeps, With direful notes to fright your sleeps; No furies here about To put the tapers out, Watch or did make the bed: 'Tis omen full of dread; But all fair signs appear Within the chamber here. Juno here far off doth stand, Cooling sleep with charming wand. "
417,XII.,"Virgins, weep not; 'twill come when, As she, so you'll be ripe for men. Then grieve her not with saying She must no more a-maying, Or by rosebuds divine Who'll be her valentine. Nor name those wanton reaks You've had at barley-breaks, But now kiss her and thus say, ""Take time, lady, while ye may"". "
419,XIII.,"Now bar the doors; the bridegroom puts The eager boys to gather nuts. And now both love and time To their full height do climb: Oh! give them active heat And moisture both complete: Fit organs for increase, To keep and to release That which may the honour'd stem Circle with a diadem. "
421,XIV.,"And now, behold! the bed or couch That ne'er knew bride's or bridegroom's touch, Feels in itself a fire; And, tickled with desire, Pants with a downy breast, As with a heart possesst, Shrugging as it did move Ev'n with the soul of love. And, oh! had it but a tongue, Doves, 'twould say, ye bill too long. "
423,XV.,"O enter then! but see ye shun A sleep until the act be done. Let kisses in their close, Breathe as the damask rose, Or sweet as is that gum Doth from Panchaia come. Teach nature now to know Lips can make cherries grow Sooner than she ever yet In her wisdom could beget. "
425,XVI.,"On your minutes, hours, days, months, years, Drop the fat blessing of the spheres. That good which heav'n can give To make you bravely live Fall like a spangling dew By day and night on you. May fortune's lily-hand Open at your command; With all lucky birds to side With the bridegroom and the bride. "
427,XVII.,"Let bounteous Fate[s] your spindles full Fill, and wind up with whitest wool. Let them not cut the thread Of life until ye bid. May death yet come at last, And not with desp'rate haste, But when ye both can say ""Come, let us now away,"" Be ye to the barn then borne, Two, like two ripe shocks of corn. "

430,150. TEARS ARE TONGUES.,"When Julia chid I stood as mute the while As is the fish or tongueless crocodile. Air coin'd to words my Julia could not hear, But she could see each eye to stamp a tear; By which mine angry mistress might descry Tears are the noble language of the eye. And when true love of words is destitute The eyes by tears speak, while the tongue is mute. "
432,151. UPON A YOUNG MOTHER OF MANY CHILDREN.,"Let all chaste matrons, when they chance to see My num'rous issue, praise and pity me: Praise me for having such a fruitful womb, Pity me, too, who found so soon a tomb. "
434,152. TO ELECTRA.,"I'll come to thee in all those shapes As Jove did when he made his rapes, Only I'll not appear to thee As he did once to Semele. Thunder and lightning I'll lay by, To talk with thee familiarly. Which done, then quickly we'll undress To one and th' other's nakedness, And, ravish'd, plunge into the bed, Bodies and souls commingled, And kissing, so as none may hear, We'll weary all the fables there. "
437,153. HIS WISH.,"It is sufficient if we pray To Jove, who gives and takes away: Let him the land and living find; Let me alone to fit the mind. "
439,154. HIS PROTESTATION TO PERILLA.,"Noonday and midnight shall at once be seen: Trees, at one time, shall be both sere and green: Fire and water shall together lie In one self-sweet-conspiring sympathy: Summer and winter shall at one time show Ripe ears of corn, and up to th' ears in snow: Seas shall be sandless; fields devoid of grass; Shapeless the world, as when all chaos was, Before, my dear Perilla, I will be False to my vow, or fall away from thee. "
441,155. LOVE PERFUMES ALL PARTS.,"If I kiss Anthea's breast, There I smell the phœnix nest: If her lip, the most sincere Altar of incense I smell there-- Hands, and thighs, and legs are all Richly aromatical. Goddess Isis can't transfer Musks and ambers more from her: Nor can Juno sweeter be, When she lies with Jove, than she. "
443,156. TO JULIA.,"Permit me, Julia, now to go away; Or by thy love decree me here to stay. If thou wilt say that I shall live with thee, Here shall my endless tabernacle be: If not, as banish'd, I will live alone There where no language ever yet was known. "
445,157. ON HIMSELF.,"Love-sick I am, and must endure A desperate grief, that finds no cure. Ah me! I try; and trying, prove _No herbs have power to cure love._ Only one sovereign salve I know, And that is death, the end of woe. "
447,158. VIRTUE IS SENSIBLE OF SUFFERING.,"Though a wise man all pressures can sustain, His virtue still is sensible of pain: Large shoulders though he has, and well can bear, He feels when packs do pinch him, and the where. "
449,159. THE CRUEL MAID.,"And cruel maid, because I see You scornful of my love and me, I'll trouble you no more; but go My way where you shall never know What is become of me: there I Will find me out a path to die, Or learn some way how to forget You and your name for ever: yet, Ere I go hence, know this from me, What will, in time, your fortune be: This to your coyness I will tell, And, having spoke it once, farewell. The lily will not long endure, Nor the snow continue pure; The rose, the violet, one day, See, both these lady-flowers decay: And you must fade as well as they. And it may chance that Love may turn, And, like to mine, make your heart burn And weep to see't; yet this thing do, That my last vow commends to you: When you shall see that I am dead, For pity let a tear be shed; And, with your mantle o'er me cast, Give my cold lips a kiss at last: If twice you kiss you need not fear That I shall stir or live more here. Next, hollow out a tomb to cover Me--me, the most despisèd lover, And write thereon: _This, reader, know: Love kill'd this man_. No more, but so. "
451,160. TO DIANEME.,"Sweet, be not proud of those two eyes Which, starlike, sparkle in their skies; Nor be you proud that you can see All hearts your captives, yours yet free; Be you not proud of that rich hair Which wantons with the love-sick air; Whenas that ruby which you wear, Sunk from the tip of your soft ear, Will last to be a precious stone When all your world of beauty's gone. "
453,"161. TO THE KING, TO CURE THE EVIL.","To find that tree of life whose fruits did feed And leaves did heal all sick of human seed: To find Bethesda and an angel there Stirring the waters, I am come; and here, At last, I find (after my much to do) The tree, Bethesda and the angel too: And all in your blest hand, which has the powers Of all those suppling-healing herbs and flowers. To that soft charm, that spell, that magic bough, That high enchantment, I betake me now, And to that hand (the branch of heaven's fair tree), I kneel for help; O! lay that hand on me, Adored Cæsar! and my faith is such I shall be heal'd if that my king but touch. The evil is not yours: my sorrow sings, ""Mine is the evil, but the cure the king's"". "
455,162. HIS MISERY IN A MISTRESS.,"Water, water I espy; Come and cool ye, all who fry In your loves; but none as I. "
456,162. HIS MISERY IN A MISTRESS.,"Though a thousand showers be Still a-falling, yet I see Not one drop to light on me. "
457,162. HIS MISERY IN A MISTRESS.,"Happy you who can have seas For to quench ye, or some ease From your kinder mistresses. "

462,164. TO A GENTLEWOMAN OBJECTING TO HIM HIS GRAY HAIRS.,"Am I despised because you say, And I dare swear, that I am gray? Know, lady, you have but your day: And time will come when you shall wear Such frost and snow upon your hair; And when (though long, it comes to pass) You question with your looking-glass; And in that sincere crystal seek, But find no rose-bud in your cheek: Nor any bed to give the show Where such a rare carnation grew. Ah! then too late, close in your chamber keeping, It will be told That you are old, By those true tears y'are weeping. "
464,165. TO CEDARS.,"If 'mongst my many poems I can see One only worthy to be wash'd by thee, I live for ever, let the rest all lie In dens of darkness or condemn'd to die. "
465,165. TO CEDARS.,"_Cedars_, oil of cedar was used for preserving manuscripts (carmina linenda cedro. _Hor._ Ars Poet., 331.) "
467,166. UPON CUPID.,"Love like a gipsy lately came, And did me much importune To see my hand, that by the same He might foretell my fortune. "
468,166. UPON CUPID.,"He saw my palm, and then, said he, I tell thee by this score here, That thou within few months shalt be The youthful Prince d'Amour here. "
469,166. UPON CUPID.,"I smil'd, and bade him once more prove, And by some cross-line show it, That I could ne'er be prince of love, Though here the princely poet. "
471,167. HOW PRIMROSES CAME GREEN.,"Virgins, time-past, known were these, Troubled with green-sicknesses: Turn'd to flowers, still the hue, Sickly girls, they bear of you. "
473,"168. TO JOS., LORD BISHOP OF EXETER.","Whom should I fear to write to if I can Stand before you, my learn'd diocesan? And never show blood-guiltiness or fear To see my lines excathedrated here. Since none so good are but you may condemn, Or here so bad but you may pardon them. If then, my lord, to sanctify my muse One only poem out of all you'll choose, And mark it for a rapture nobly writ, 'Tis good confirm'd, for you have bishop'd it. "

476,169. UPON A BLACK TWIST ROUNDING THE ARM OF THE COUNTESS OF CARLISLE.,"I saw about her spotless wrist, Of blackest silk, a curious twist; Which, circumvolving gently, there Enthrall'd her arm as prisoner. Dark was the jail, but as if light Had met t'engender with the night; Or so as darkness made a stay To show at once both night and day. One fancy more! but if there be Such freedom in captivity, I beg of Love that ever I May in like chains of darkness lie. "
478,170. ON HIMSELF.,"I fear no earthly powers, But care for crowns of flowers; And love to have my beard With wine and oil besmear'd. This day I'll drown all sorrow: Who knows to live to-morrow? "
480,172. A RING PRESENTED TO JULIA.,"Julia, I bring To thee this ring, Made for thy finger fit; To show by this That our love is (Or should be) like to it. "
481,172. A RING PRESENTED TO JULIA.,"Close though it be The joint is free; So, when love's yoke is on, It must not gall, Or fret at all With hard oppression. "
482,172. A RING PRESENTED TO JULIA.,"But it must play Still either way, And be, too, such a yoke As not too wide To overslide, Or be so strait to choke. "
483,172. A RING PRESENTED TO JULIA.,So we who bear This beam must rear Ourselves to such a height As that the stay Of either may Create the burden light. 
484,172. A RING PRESENTED TO JULIA.,"And as this round Is nowhere found To flaw, or else to sever: So let our love As endless prove, And pure as gold for ever. "
486,173. TO THE DETRACTOR.,"Where others love and praise my verses, still Thy long black thumb-nail marks them out for ill: A fellon take it, or some whitflaw come For to unslate or to untile that thumb! But cry thee mercy: exercise thy nails To scratch or claw, so that thy tongue not rails: Some numbers prurient are, and some of these Are wanton with their itch; scratch, and 'twill please. "
487,173. TO THE DETRACTOR.,"_Fellon_, a sore, especially in the finger. _Whitflaw_, or whitlow. "
489,174. UPON THE SAME.,"I ask'd thee oft what poets thou hast read, And lik'st the best. Still thou reply'st: The dead. I shall, ere long, with green turfs cover'd be; Then sure thou'lt like or thou wilt envy me. "
491,175. JULIA'S PETTICOAT.,"Thy azure robe I did behold As airy as the leaves of gold, Which, erring here, and wandering there, Pleas'd with transgression ev'rywhere: Sometimes 'twould pant, and sigh, and heave, As if to stir it scarce had leave: But, having got it, thereupon 'Twould make a brave expansion. And pounc'd with stars it showed to me Like a celestial canopy. Sometimes 'twould blaze, and then abate, Like to a flame grown moderate: Sometimes away 'twould wildly fling, Then to thy thighs so closely cling That some conceit did melt me down As lovers fall into a swoon: And, all confus'd, I there did lie Drown'd in delights, but could not die. That leading cloud I follow'd still, Hoping t' have seen of it my fill; But ah! I could not: should it move To life eternal, I could love. "
494,176. TO MUSIC.,"Begin to charm, and, as thou strok'st mine ears With thy enchantment, melt me into tears. Then let thy active hand scud o'er thy lyre, And make my spirits frantic with the fire. That done, sink down into a silvery strain, And make me smooth as balm and oil again. "
496,177. DISTRUST.,"To safeguard man from wrongs, there nothing must Be truer to him than a wise distrust. And to thyself be best this sentence known: _Hear all men speak, but credit few or none_. "
498,178. CORINNA'S GOING A-MAYING.,"Get up, get up for shame, the blooming morn Upon her wings presents the god unshorn. See how Aurora throws her fair Fresh-quilted colours through the air: Get up, sweet slug-a-bed, and see The dew bespangling herb and tree. Each flower has wept and bow'd toward the east Above an hour since: yet you not dress'd; Nay! not so much as out of bed? When all the birds have matins said And sung their thankful hymns, 'tis sin, Nay, profanation to keep in, Whereas a thousand virgins on this day Spring, sooner than the lark, to fetch in May. "
499,178. CORINNA'S GOING A-MAYING.,"Rise and put on your foliage, and be seen To come forth, like the spring-time, fresh and green, And sweet as Flora. Take no care For jewels for your gown or hair: Fear not; the leaves will strew Gems in abundance upon you: Besides, the childhood of the day has kept, Against you come, some orient pearls unwept; Come and receive them while the light Hangs on the dew-locks of the night: And Titan on the eastern hill Retires himself, or else stands still Till you come forth. Wash, dress, be brief in praying: Few beads are best when once we go a-Maying. "
500,178. CORINNA'S GOING A-MAYING.,"Come, my Corinna, come; and, coming, mark How each field turns a street, each street a park Made green and trimm'd with trees: see how Devotion gives each house a bough Or branch: each porch, each door ere this An ark, a tabernacle is, Made up of white-thorn neatly interwove; As if here were those cooler shades of love. Can such delights be in the street And open fields and we not see't? Come, we'll abroad; and let's obey The proclamation made for May: And sin no more, as we have done, by staying; But, my Corinna, come, let's go a-Maying. "
501,178. CORINNA'S GOING A-MAYING.,"There's not a budding boy or girl this day But is got up, and gone to bring in May. A deal of youth, ere this, is come Back, and with white-thorn laden home. Some have despatch'd their cakes and cream Before that we have left to dream: And some have wept, and woo'd, and plighted troth, And chose their priest, ere we can cast off sloth: Many a green-gown has been given; Many a kiss, both odd and even: Many a glance too has been sent From out the eye, love's firmament; Many a jest told of the keys betraying This night, and locks pick'd, yet we're not a-Maying. "
502,178. CORINNA'S GOING A-MAYING.,"Come, let us go while we are in our prime; And take the harmless folly of the time. We shall grow old apace, and die Before we know our liberty. Our life is short, and our days run As fast away as does the sun; And, as a vapour or a drop of rain, Once lost, can ne'er be found again, So when or you or I are made A fable, song, or fleeting shade, All love, all liking, all delight Lies drowned with us in endless night. Then while time serves, and we are but decaying, Come, my Corinna, come, let's go a-Maying. "

508,180. UPON A CHILD. AN EPITAPH.,"But born, and like a short delight, I glided by my parents' sight. That done, the harder fates denied My longer stay, and so I died. If, pitying my sad parents' tears, You'll spill a tear or two with theirs, And with some flowers my grave bestrew, Love and they'll thank you for't. Adieu. "

517,"182. THE CAPTIV'D BEE, OR THE LITTLE FILCHER.","As Julia once a-slumbering lay It chanced a bee did fly that way, After a dew or dew-like shower, To tipple freely in a flower. For some rich flower he took the lip Of Julia, and began to sip; But when he felt he sucked from thence Honey, and in the quintessence, He drank so much he scarce could stir, So Julia took the pilferer. And thus surprised, as filchers use, He thus began himself t' excuse: Sweet lady-flower, I never brought Hither the least one thieving thought; But, taking those rare lips of yours For some fresh, fragrant, luscious flowers, I thought I might there take a taste, Where so much syrup ran at waste. Besides, know this: I never sting The flower that gives me nourishing; But with a kiss, or thanks, do pay For honey that I bear away. This said, he laid his little scrip Of honey 'fore her ladyship: And told her, as some tears did fall, That that he took, and that was all. At which she smiled, and bade him go And take his bag; but thus much know: When next he came a-pilfering so, He should from her full lips derive Honey enough to fill his hive. "

AN ODE TO MASTER ENDYMION PORTER, UPON HIS BROTHER'S DEATH.","Yet, Porter, while thou keep'st alive, In death I thrive: And like a phœnix re-aspire From out my nard and fun'ral fire: And as I prune my feathered youth, so I Do mar'l how I could die When I had thee, my chief preserver, by.

525,"186. TO HIS DYING BROTHER, MASTER WILLIAM HERRICK.","Life of my life, 'take not so soon thy flight, But stay the time till we have bade good-night. Thou hast both wind and tide with thee; thy way As soon despatch'd is by the night as day. Let us not then so rudely henceforth go Till we have wept, kissed, sigh'd, shook hands, or so. There's pain in parting, and a kind of hell, When once true lovers take their last farewell. What! shall we two our endless leaves take here Without a sad look or a solemn tear? He knows not love that hath not this truth proved, _Love is most loth to leave the thing beloved_. Pay we our vows and go; yet when we part, Then, even then, I will bequeath my heart Into thy loving hands; for I'll keep none To warm my breast when thou, my pulse, art gone. No, here I'll last, and walk (a harmless shade) About this urn wherein thy dust is laid, To guard it so as nothing here shall be Heavy to hurt those sacred seeds of thee. "
527,187. THE OLIVE BRANCH.,"Sadly I walk'd within the field, To see what comfort it would yield; And as I went my private way An olive branch before me lay, And seeing it I made a stay, And took it up and view'd it; then Kissing the omen, said Amen; Be, be it so, and let this be A divination unto me; That in short time my woes shall cease And Love shall crown my end with peace. "
529,189. TO CHERRY-BLOSSOMS.,"Ye may simper, blush and smile, And perfume the air awhile; But, sweet things, ye must be gone, Fruit, ye know, is coming on; Then, ah! then, where is your grace, Whenas cherries come in place? "
531,190. HOW LILIES CAME WHITE.,"White though ye be, yet, lilies, know, From the first ye were not so; But I'll tell ye What befell ye: Cupid and his mother lay In a cloud, while both did play, He with his pretty finger press'd The ruby niplet of her breast; Out of which the cream of light, Like to a dew, Fell down on you And made ye white. "
533,191. TO PANSIES.,"Ah, cruel love! must I endure Thy many scorns and find no cure? Say, are thy medicines made to be Helps to all others but to me? I'll leave thee and to pansies come, Comforts you'll afford me some; You can ease my heart and do What love could ne'er be brought unto. "

539,193. THE LILY IN A CRYSTAL.,"You see how cream but naked is Nor dances in the eye Without a strawberry, Or some fine tincture like to this, Which draws the sight thereto More by that wantoning with it Than when the paler hue No mixture did admit. "
540,193. THE LILY IN A CRYSTAL.,"You see how amber through the streams More gently strokes the sight With some conceal'd delight Than when he darts his radiant beams Into the boundless air; Where either too much light his worth Doth all at once impair, Or set it little forth. "
541,193. THE LILY IN A CRYSTAL.,"Put purple grapes or cherries in- To glass, and they will send More beauty to commend Them from that clean and subtle skin Than if they naked stood, And had no other pride at all But their own flesh and blood And tinctures natural. "
542,193. THE LILY IN A CRYSTAL.,"Thus lily, rose, grape, cherry, cream, And strawberry do stir More love when they transfer A weak, a soft, a broken beam, Than if they should discover At full their proper excellence; Without some scene cast over To juggle with the sense. "
543,193. THE LILY IN A CRYSTAL.,"Thus let this crystal'd lily be A rule how far to teach Your nakedness must reach; And that no further than we see Those glaring colours laid By art's wise hand, but to this end They should obey a shade, Lest they too far extend. "
544,193. THE LILY IN A CRYSTAL.,"So though you're white as swan or snow, And have the power to move A world of men to love, Yet when your lawns and silks shall flow, And that white cloud divide Into a doubtful twilight, then, Then will your hidden pride Raise greater fires in men. "

False in legs, and false in thighs; False in breast, teeth, hair, and eyes; False in head, and false enough; Only true in shreds and stuff. "

Soul of my life and fame! Eternal lamp of love! whose radiant flame Out-glares the heaven's Osiris,[H] and thy gleams Out-shine the splendour of his mid-day beams. Welcome, O welcome, my illustrious spouse; Welcome as are the ends unto my vows; Aye! far more welcome than the happy soil The sea-scourged merchant, after all his toil, Salutes with tears of joy, when fires betray The smoky chimneys of his Ithaca. Where hast thou been so long from my embraces, Poor pitied exile? Tell me, did thy graces Fly discontented hence, and for a time Did rather choose to bless another clime? Or went'st thou to this end, the more to move me, By thy short absence, to desire and love thee? Why frowns my sweet? Why won't my saint confer Favours on me, her fierce idolater? Why are those looks, those looks the which have been Time-past so fragrant, sickly now drawn in Like a dull twilight? Tell me, and the fault I'll expiate with sulphur, hair and salt; And, with the crystal humour of the spring, Purge hence the guilt and kill this quarrelling. Wo't thou not smile or tell me what's amiss? Have I been cold to hug thee, too remiss, Too temp'rate in embracing? Tell me, has desire To thee-ward died i' th' embers, and no fire Left in this rak'd-up ash-heap as a mark To testify the glowing of a spark? Have I divorc'd thee only to combine In hot adult'ry with another wine? True, I confess I left thee, and appeal 'Twas done by me more to confirm my zeal And double my affection on thee, as do those Whose love grows more inflam'd by being foes. But to forsake thee ever, could there be A thought of such-like possibility? When thou thyself dar'st say thy isles shall lack Grapes before Herrick leaves canary sack. Thou mak'st me airy, active to be borne, Like Iphiclus, upon the tops of corn. Thou mak'st me nimble, as the winged hours, To dance and caper on the heads of flowers, And ride the sunbeams. Can there be a thing Under the heavenly Isis[I] that can bring More love unto my life, or can present My genius with a fuller blandishment? Illustrious idol! could th' Egyptians seek Help from the garlic, onion and the leek And pay no vows to thee, who wast their best God, and far more transcendent than the rest? Had Cassius, that weak water-drinker, known Thee in thy vine, or had but tasted one Small chalice of thy frantic liquor, he, As the wise Cato, had approv'd of thee. Had not Jove's son,[J] that brave Tirynthian swain, Invited to the Thesbian banquet, ta'en Full goblets of thy gen'rous blood, his sprite Ne'er had kept heat for fifty maids that night. Come, come and kiss me; love and lust commends Thee and thy beauties; kiss, we will be friends Too strong for fate to break us. Look upon Me with that full pride of complexion As queens meet queens, or come thou unto me As Cleopatra came to Anthony, When her high carriage did at once present To the triumvir love and wonderment. Swell up my nerves with spirit; let my blood Run through my veins like to a hasty flood. Fill each part full of fire, active to do What thy commanding soul shall put it to; And till I turn apostate to thy love, Which here I vow to serve, do not remove Thy fires from me, but Apollo's curse Blast these-like actions, or a thing that's worse. When these circumstants shall but live to see The time that I prevaricate from thee. Call me the son of beer, and then confine Me to the tap, the toast, the turf; let wine Ne'er shine upon me; may my numbers all Run to a sudden death and funeral. And last, when thee, dear spouse, I disavow, Ne'er may prophetic Daphne crown my brow. "

Three days before the shutting in of May (With whitest wool be ever crown'd that day!) To all our joy a sweet-fac'd child was born, More tender than the childhood of the morn. _Chor._ Pan pipe to him, and bleats of lambs and sheep Let lullaby the pretty prince asleep! _Mirt._ And that his birth should be more singular At noon of day was seen a silver star, Bright as the wise men's torch which guided them To God's sweet babe, when born at Bethlehem; While golden angels (some have told to me) Sung out his birth with heavenly minstrelsy. _Amin._ O rare! But is't a trespass if we three Should wend along his babyship to see? _Mirt._ Not so, not so. _Chor._ But if it chance to prove At most a fault, 'tis but a fault of love. _Amar._ But, dear Mirtillo, I have heard it told Those learned men brought incense, myrrh and gold From countries far, with store of spices sweet, And laid them down for offerings at his feet. _Mirt._ 'Tis true, indeed; and each of us will bring Unto our smiling and our blooming king A neat, though not so great an offering. _Amar._ A garland for my gift shall be Of flowers ne'er suck'd by th' thieving bee; And all most sweet; yet all less sweet than he. _Amin._ And I will bear, along with you, Leaves dropping down the honeyed dew, With oaten pipes as sweet as new. _Mirt._ And I a sheep-hook will bestow, To have his little kingship know, As he is prince, he's shepherd too. _Chor._ Come, let's away, and quickly let's be dress'd, And quickly give--_the swiftest grace is best_. And when before him we have laid our treasures, We'll bless the babe, then back to country pleasures. "

639,"DEDICATED TO MR. JOHN MERRIFIELD, COUNSELLOR-AT-LAW.","Rare temples thou hast seen, I know, And rich for in and outward show: Survey this chapel, built alone, Without or lime, or wood, or stone: Then say if one thou'st seen more fine Than this, the fairies' once, now thine. "
641,THE TEMPLE.,"A way enchased with glass and beads There is, that to the chapel leads: Whose structure, for his holy rest, Is here the halcyon's curious nest: Into the which who looks shall see His temple of idolatry, Where he of godheads has such store, As Rome's pantheon had not more. His house of Rimmon this he calls, Girt with small bones instead of walls. First, in a niche, more black than jet, His idol-cricket there is set: Then in a polished oval by There stands his idol-beetle-fly: Next in an arch, akin to this, His idol-canker seated is: Then in a round is placed by these His golden god, Cantharides. So that, where'er ye look, ye see, No capital, no cornice free, Or frieze, from this fine frippery. Now this the fairies would have known, Theirs is a mixed religion: And some have heard the elves it call Part pagan, part papistical. If unto me all tongues were granted, I could not speak the saints here painted. Saint Tit, Saint Nit, Saint Is, Saint Itis, Who 'gainst Mab's-state placed here right is; Saint Will o' th' Wisp, of no great bigness, But _alias_ called here _Fatuus ignis_; Saint Frip, Saint Trip, Saint Fill, Saint Fillie Neither those other saintships will I Here go about for to recite Their number, almost infinite, Which one by one here set down are In this most curious calendar. First, at the entrance of the gate A little puppet-priest doth wait, Who squeaks to all the comers there: ""_Favour your tongues who enter here; Pure hands bring hither without stain._"" A second pules: ""_Hence, hence, profane!_"" Hard by, i' th' shell of half a nut, The holy-water there is put: A little brush of squirrel's hairs (Composed of odd, not even pairs,) Stands in the platter, or close by, To purge the fairy family. Near to the altar stands the priest, There off'ring up the Holy Grist, Ducking in mood and perfect tense, With (much-good-do-'t him) reverence. The altar is not here four-square, Nor in a form triangular, Nor made of glass, or wood, or stone, But of a little transverse bone; Which boys and bruckel'd children call (Playing for points and pins) cockal. Whose linen drapery is a thin Subtile and ductile codlin's skin: Which o'er the board is smoothly spread With little seal-work damasked. The fringe that circumbinds it too Is spangle-work of trembling dew, Which, gently gleaming, makes a show Like frost-work glitt'ring on the snow. Upon this fetuous board doth stand Something for show-bread, and at hand, Just in the middle of the altar, Upon an end, the fairy-psalter, Grac'd with the trout-flies' curious wings, Which serve for watchet ribbonings. Now, we must know, the elves are led Right by the rubric which they read. And, if report of them be true, They have their text for what they do; Aye, and their book of canons too. And, as Sir Thomas Parson tells, They have their book of articles; And, if that fairy-knight not lies, They have their book of homilies; And other scriptures that design A short but righteous discipline. The basin stands the board upon To take the free oblation: A little pin-dust, which they hold More precious than we prize our gold Which charity they give to many Poor of the parish, if there's any. Upon the ends of these neat rails, Hatch'd with the silver-light of snails, The elves in formal manner fix Two pure and holy candlesticks: In either which a small tall bent Burns for the altar's ornament. For sanctity they have to these Their curious copes and surplices Of cleanest cobweb hanging by In their religious vestery. They have their ash-pans and their brooms To purge the chapel and the rooms; Their many mumbling Mass-priests here, And many a dapper chorister, Their ush'ring vergers, here likewise Their canons and their chanteries. Of cloister-monks they have enow, Aye, and their abbey-lubbers too; And, if their legend do not lie, They much affect the papacy. And since the last is dead, there's hope _Elf Boniface shall next be pope_. They have their cups and chalices; Their pardons and indulgences; Their beads of nits, bells, books, and wax Candles, forsooth, and other knacks; Their holy oil, their fasting spittle; Their sacred salt here, not a little; Dry chips, old shoes, rags, grease and bones; Beside their fumigations To drive the devil from the cod-piece Of the friar (of work an odd piece). Many a trifle, too, and trinket, And for what use, scarce man would think it. Next, then, upon the chanters' side An apple's core is hung up dri'd, With rattling kernels, which is rung To call to morn and even-song. The saint to which the most he prays And offers incense nights and days, The lady of the lobster is, Whose foot-pace he doth stroke and kiss; And humbly chives of saffron brings For his most cheerful offerings. When, after these, h'as paid his vows He lowly to the altar bows; And then he dons the silk-worm's shed, Like a Turk's turban on his head, And reverently departeth thence, Hid in a cloud of frankincense, And by the glow-worm's light well guided, Goes to the feast that's now provided. "

Crowned with the ears of corn, now come, And to the pipe sing harvest home. Come forth, my lord, and see the cart Dressed up with all the country art: See here a maukin, there a sheet, As spotless pure as it is sweet: The horses, mares, and frisking fillies, Clad all in linen white as lilies. The harvest swains and wenches bound For joy, to see the hock-cart crowned. About the cart, hear how the rout Of rural younglings raise the shout; Pressing before, some coming after, Those with a shout, and these with laughter. Some bless the cart, some kiss the sheaves, Some prank them up with oaken leaves: Some cross the fill-horse, some with great Devotion stroke the home-borne wheat: While other rustics, less attent To prayers than to merriment, Run after with their breeches rent. Well, on, brave boys, to your lord's hearth, Glitt'ring with fire, where, for your mirth, Ye shall see first the large and chief Foundation of your feast, fat beef: With upper stories, mutton, veal And bacon (which makes full the meal), With sev'ral dishes standing by, As here a custard, there a pie, And here all-tempting frumenty. And for to make the merry cheer, If smirking wine be wanting here, There's that which drowns all care, stout beer; Which freely drink to your lord's health, Then to the plough, the commonwealth, Next to your flails, your fans, your fats, Then to the maids with wheaten hats: To the rough sickle, and crook'd scythe, Drink, frolic boys, till all be blithe. Feed, and grow fat; and as ye eat Be mindful that the lab'ring neat, As you, may have their fill of meat. And know, besides, ye must revoke The patient ox unto the yoke, And all go back unto the plough And harrow, though they're hanged up now. And, you must know, your lord's word's true, Feed him ye must, whose food fills you; And that this pleasure is like rain, Not sent ye for to drown your pain, But for to make it spring again. "

703,253. NOT TO LOVE.,"He that will not love must be My scholar, and learn this of me: There be in love as many fears As the summer's corn has ears: Sighs, and sobs, and sorrows more Than the sand that makes the shore: Freezing cold and fiery heats, Fainting swoons and deadly sweats; Now an ague, then a fever, Both tormenting lovers ever. Would'st thou know, besides all these, How hard a woman 'tis to please, How cross, how sullen, and how soon She shifts and changes like the moon. How false, how hollow she's in heart: And how she is her own least part: How high she's priz'd, and worth but small; Little thou'lt love, or not at all. "
705,254. TO MUSIC. A SONG.,"Music, thou queen of heaven, care-charming spell, That strik'st a stillness into hell: Thou that tam'st tigers, and fierce storms that rise, With thy soul-melting lullabies, Fall down, down, down from those thy chiming spheres, To charm our souls, as thou enchant'st our ears.

710,256. UPON THE DEATH OF HIS SPARROW. AN ELEGY.,"Why do not all fresh maids appear To work love's sampler only here, Where spring-time smiles throughout the year? Are not here rosebuds, pinks, all flowers Nature begets by th' sun and showers, Met in one hearse-cloth to o'erspread The body of the under-dead? Phil, the late dead, the late dead dear, O! may no eye distil a tear For you once lost, who weep not here! Had Lesbia, too-too kind, but known This sparrow, she had scorn'd her own: And for this dead which under lies Wept out her heart, as well as eyes. But, endless peace, sit here and keep My Phil the time he has to sleep; And thousand virgins come and weep To make these flowery carpets show Fresh as their blood, and ever grow, Till passengers shall spend their doom: Not Virgil's gnat had such a tomb.

Alas! you have not known that shower That mars a flower, Nor felt th' unkind Breath of a blasting wind, Nor are ye worn with years, Or warp'd as we, Who think it strange to see Such pretty flowers, like to orphans young, To speak by tears before ye have a tongue. "
714,257. TO PRIMROSES FILLED WITH MORNING DEW.,"Speak, whimp'ring younglings, and make known The reason why Ye droop and weep; Is it for want of sleep? Or childish lullaby? Or that ye have not seen as yet The violet? Or brought a kiss From that sweetheart to this? No, no, this sorrow shown By your tears shed Would have this lecture read: That things of greatest, so of meanest worth, Conceiv'd with grief are, and with tears brought forth. "

Seas chafe and fret, and beat, and overboil, But turn soon after calm as balm or oil. Winds have their time to rage; but when they cease The leafy trees nod in a still-born peace. Your storm is over; lady, now appear Like to the peeping springtime of the year. Off then with grave clothes; put fresh colours on, And flow and flame in your vermilion.

WHEELER, UNDER THE NAME OF THE LOST SHEPHERDESS.","Among the myrtles as I walk'd, Love and my sighs thus intertalk'd: Tell me, said I, in deep distress, Where I may find my shepherdess. Thou fool, said Love, know'st thou not this? In everything that's sweet she is. In yond' carnation go and seek, There thou shalt find her lip and cheek: In that enamell'd pansy by, There thou shalt have her curious eye: In bloom of peach and rose's bud, There waves the streamer of her blood. 'Tis true, said I, and thereupon I went to pluck them one by one, To make of parts a union: But on a sudden all were gone. At which I stopp'd; said Love, these be The true resemblances of thee; For, as these flowers, thy joys must die, And in the turning of an eye: And all thy hopes of her must wither, Like those short sweets, ere knit together.

Your leafy throne, with lily-work possess, And be both princess here and poetess. "

735,THE DUKE OF YORK.,"May his pretty dukeship grow Like t'a rose of Jericho: Sweeter far than ever yet Showers or sunshines could beget. May the Graces and the Hours Strew his hopes and him with flowers: And so dress him up with love As to be the chick of Jove. May the thrice-three sisters sing Him the sovereign of their spring: And entitle none to be Prince of Helicon but he. May his soft foot, where it treads, Gardens thence produce and meads: And those meadows full be set With the rose and violet. May his ample name be known To the last succession: And his actions high be told Through the world, but writ in gold. "

810,293. OBERON'S FEAST.,"_Shapcot! to thee the fairy state I, with discretion, dedicate. Because thou prizest things that are Curious and unfamiliar. Take first the feast; these dishes gone, We'll see the Fairy Court anon._ "
811,293. OBERON'S FEAST.,"A little mushroom table spread, After short prayers, they set on bread; A moon-parch'd grain of purest wheat, With some small glittering grit to eat His choice bits with; then in a trice They make a feast less great than nice. But all this while his eye is serv'd, We must not think his ear was sterv'd; But that there was in place to stir His spleen, the chirring grasshopper, The merry cricket, puling fly, The piping gnat for minstrelsy. And now we must imagine first, The elves present, to quench his thirst, A pure seed-pearl of infant dew Brought and besweetened in a blue And pregnant violet, which done, His kitling eyes begin to run Quite through the table, where he spies The horns of papery butterflies: Of which he eats, and tastes a little Of that we call the cuckoo's spittle. A little fuzz-ball pudding stands By, yet not blessed by his hands; That was too coarse: but then forthwith He ventures boldly on the pith Of sugar'd rush, and eats the sagg And well-bestrutted bee's sweet bag: Gladding his palate with some store Of emmets' eggs; what would he more? But beards of mice, a newt's stewed thigh, A bloated earwig and a fly; With the red-capp'd worm that's shut Within the concave of a nut, Brown as his tooth. A little moth Late fatten'd in a piece of cloth: With withered cherries, mandrakes' ears, Moles' eyes; to these the slain stag's tears The unctuous dewlaps of a snail, The broke-heart of a nightingale O'ercome in music; with a wine Ne'er ravish'd from the flattering vine, But gently press'd from the soft side Of the most sweet and dainty bride, Brought in a dainty daisy, which He fully quaffs up to bewitch His blood to height; this done, commended Grace by his priest; _the feast is ended_. "
814,294. EVENT OF THINGS NOT IN OUR POWER.,"By time and counsel do the best we can, Th' event is never in the power of man. "
816,295. UPON HER BLUSH.,When Julia blushes she does show Cheeks like to roses when they blow. 
818,296. MERITS MAKE THE MAN.,"Our honours and our commendations be Due to the merits, not authority. "
820,297. TO VIRGINS.,"Hear, ye virgins, and I'll teach What the times of old did preach. Rosamond was in a bower Kept, as Danae in a tower: But yet Love, who subtle is, Crept to that, and came to this. Be ye lock'd up like to these, Or the rich Hesperides, Or those babies in your eyes, In their crystal nunneries; Notwithstanding Love will win, Or else force a passage in: And as coy be as you can, Gifts will get ye, or the man. "
823,298. VIRTUE.,Each must in virtue strive for to excel; _That man lives twice that lives the first life well_. 
825,299. THE BELLMAN.,"From noise of scare-fires rest ye free, From murders _Benedicite_. From all mischances that may fright Your pleasing slumbers in the night, Mercy secure ye all, and keep The goblin from ye while ye sleep. Past one o'clock, and almost two! My masters all, good-day to you. "
828,300. BASHFULNESS.,"Of all our parts, the eyes express The sweetest kind of bashfulness. "

830,THE SIGNET TO HIS MAJESTY. EPIG.,"For one so rarely tun'd to fit all parts, For one to whom espous'd are all the arts, Long have I sought for, but could never see Them all concentr'd in one man, but thee. Thus, thou that man art whom the fates conspir'd To make but one, and that's thyself, admir'd. "
832,302. UPON PRUDENCE BALDWIN: HER SICKNESS.,"Prue, my dearest maid, is sick, Almost to be lunatic: Æsculapius! come and bring Means for her recovering; And a gallant cock shall be Offer'd up by her to thee. "
833,302. UPON PRUDENCE BALDWIN: HER SICKNESS.,"_Cock_, the traditional offering to Æsculapius; cp. the last words of Socrates; cp. Ben Jonson, Epig. xiii. "
835,303. TO APOLLO. A SHORT HYMN.,"Phœbus! when that I a verse Or some numbers more rehearse, Tune my words that they may fall Each way smoothly musical: For which favour there shall be Swans devoted unto thee. "
837,304. A HYMN TO BACCHUS.,"Bacchus, let me drink no more; Wild are seas that want a shore. When our drinking has no stint, There is no one pleasure in't. I have drank up, for to please Thee, that great cup Hercules: Urge no more, and there shall be Daffodils given up to thee. "
839,306. ON HIMSELF.,"Here down my wearied limbs I'll lay; My pilgrim's staff, my weed of gray, My palmer's hat, my scallop's shell, My cross, my cord, and all, farewell. For having now my journey done, Just at the setting of the sun, Here I have found a chamber fit, God and good friends be thanked for it, Where if I can a lodger be, A little while from tramplers free, At my up-rising next I shall, If not requite, yet thank ye all. Meanwhile, the holy-rood hence fright The fouler fiend and evil sprite From scaring you or yours this night. "
841,307. CASUALTIES.,"Good things that come of course, far less do please Than those which come by sweet contingencies. "
843,308. BRIBES AND GIFTS GET ALL.,"Dead falls the cause if once the hand be mute; But let that speak, the client gets the suit. "
845,309. THE END.,"If well thou hast begun, go on fore-right; _It is the end that crowns us, not the fight_. "
847,310. UPON A CHILD THAT DIED.,"Here she lies, a pretty bud, Lately made of flesh and blood: Who as soon fell fast asleep As her little eyes did peep. Give her strewings, but not stir The earth that lightly covers her. "
849,"312. CONTENT, NOT CATES.","'Tis not the food, but the content That makes the table's merriment. Where trouble serves the board, we eat The platters there as soon as meat. A little pipkin with a bit Of mutton or of veal in it, Set on my table, trouble-free, More than a feast contenteth me. "
850,NORTHLY AND THE MOST WITTY MRS. LETTICE YARD.,"313. THE ENTERTAINMENT; OR, PORCH-VERSE, AT THE MARRIAGE OF MR. HENRY NORTHLY AND THE MOST WITTY MRS. LETTICE YARD. "
851,NORTHLY AND THE MOST WITTY MRS. LETTICE YARD.,"Welcome! but yet no entrance, till we bless First you, then you, and both for white success. Profane no porch, young man and maid, for fear Ye wrong the Threshold-god that keeps peace here: Please him, and then all good-luck will betide You, the brisk bridegroom, you, the dainty bride. Do all things sweetly, and in comely wise; Put on your garlands first, then sacrifice: That done, when both of you have seemly fed, We'll call on Night, to bring ye both to bed: Where, being laid, all fair signs looking on, Fish-like, increase then to a million; And millions of spring-times may ye have, Which spent, one death bring to ye both one grave. "
853,314. THE GOOD-NIGHT OR BLESSING.,"Blessings in abundance come To the bride and to her groom; May the bed and this short night Know the fulness of delight! Pleasures many here attend ye, And, ere long, a boy Love send ye Curled and comely, and so trim, Maids, in time, may ravish him. Thus a dew of graces fall On ye both; good-night to all. "
855,316. TO DAFFODILS.,"Fair daffodils, we weep to see You haste away so soon; As yet the early-rising sun Has not attain'd his noon. Stay, stay, Until the hasting day Has run But to the evensong; And, having prayed together, we Will go with you along. "
856,316. TO DAFFODILS.,"We have short time to stay, as you, We have as short a spring; As quick a growth to meet decay, As you, or anything. We die, As your hours do, and dry Away, Like to the summer's rain; Or as the pearls of morning's dew, Ne'er to be found again. "
857,"318. UPON A LADY THAT DIED IN CHILD-BED, AND LEFT A DAUGHTER BEHIND HER.","318. UPON A LADY THAT DIED IN CHILD-BED, AND LEFT A DAUGHTER BEHIND HER. "
858,"318. UPON A LADY THAT DIED IN CHILD-BED, AND LEFT A DAUGHTER BEHIND HER.","As gilliflowers do but stay To blow, and seed, and so away; So you, sweet lady, sweet as May, The garden's glory, lived a while To lend the world your scent and smile. But when your own fair print was set Once in a virgin flosculet, Sweet as yourself, and newly blown, To give that life, resigned your own: But so as still the mother's power Lives in the pretty lady-flower. "
860,319. A NEW-YEAR'S GIFT SENT TO SIR SIMON STEWARD.,"No news of navies burnt at seas; No noise of late-spawn'd tittyries; No closet plot, or open vent, That frights men with a parliament; No new device or late-found trick To read by the stars the kingdom's sick; No gin to catch the state, or wring The freeborn nostril of the king, We send to you; but here a jolly Verse, crown'd with ivy and with holly, That tells of winter's tales and mirth, That milkmaids make about the hearth, Of Christmas sports, the wassail-bowl, That['s] tost up, after fox-i'-th'-hole; Of blind-man-buff, and of the care That young men have to shoe the mare; Of Twelfth-tide cakes, of peas and beans, Wherewith you make those merry scenes, Whenas ye choose your king and queen, And cry out: _Hey, for our town green_; Of ash-heaps, in the which ye use Husbands and wives by streaks to choose; Of crackling laurel, which fore-sounds A plenteous harvest to your grounds: Of these and such-like things for shift, We send instead of New-Year's gift. Read then, and when your faces shine With buxom meat and cap'ring wine, Remember us in cups full crown'd, And let our city-health go round, Quite through the young maids and the men, To the ninth number, if not ten; Until the fired chesnuts leap For joy to see the fruits ye reap From the plump chalice and the cup, That tempts till it be tossed up; Then as ye sit about your embers, Call not to mind those fled Decembers, But think on these that are t' appear As daughters to the instant year: Sit crown'd with rosebuds, and carouse Till Liber Pater twirls the house About your ears; and lay upon The year your cares that's fled and gone. And let the russet swains the plough And harrow hang up, resting now; And to the bagpipe all address, Till sleep takes place of weariness. And thus, throughout, with Christmas plays Frolic the full twelve holidays. "
861,319. A NEW-YEAR'S GIFT SENT TO SIR SIMON STEWARD.,"_Tittyries_, _i.e._, the Tityre-tues; see Note. _Fox-i'-th'-hole_, a game of hopping. _To shoe the mare_, or, shoe the wild mare, a Christmas game. _Buxom_, tender. _Liber Pater_, Father Bacchus. "
863,"320. MATINS; OR, MORNING PRAYER.","When with the virgin morning thou dost rise, Crossing thyself, come thus to sacrifice; First wash thy heart in innocence, then bring Pure hands, pure habits, pure, pure everything. Next to the altar humbly kneel, and thence Give up thy soul in clouds of frankincense. Thy golden censers, fill'd with odours sweet, Shall make thy actions with their ends to meet. "
865,321. EVENSONG.,"Begin with Jove; then is the work half done, And runs most smoothly when 'tis well begun. Jove's is the first and last: the morn's his due, The midst is thine; but Jove's the evening too; As sure a matins does to him belong, So sure he lays claim to the evensong. "
867,322. THE BRACELET TO JULIA.,"Why I tie about thy wrist, Julia, this my silken twist; For what other reason is't, But to show thee how, in part, Thou my pretty captive art? But thy bondslave is my heart; 'Tis but silk that bindeth thee, Knap the thread and thou art free: But 'tis otherwise with me; I am bound, and fast bound, so That from thee I cannot go; If I could, I would not so. "
869,323. THE CHRISTIAN MILITANT.,"A man prepar'd against all ills to come, That dares to dead the fire of martyrdom; That sleeps at home, and sailing there at ease, Fears not the fierce sedition of the seas; That's counter-proof against the farm's mishaps, Undreadful too of courtly thunderclaps; That wears one face, like heaven, and never shows A change when fortune either comes or goes; That keeps his own strong guard in the despite Of what can hurt by day or harm by night; That takes and re-delivers every stroke Of chance (as made up all of rock and oak); That sighs at others' death, smiles at his own Most dire and horrid crucifixion. Who for true glory suffers thus, we grant Him to be here our Christian militant. "
871,324. A SHORT HYMN TO LAR.,"Though I cannot give thee fires Glittering to my free desires; These accept, and I'll be free, Offering poppy unto thee. "
873,325. ANOTHER TO NEPTUNE.,"Mighty Neptune, may it please Thee, the rector of the seas, That my barque may safely run Through thy watery region; And a tunny-fish shall be Offered up with thanks to thee. "
875,327. HIS EMBALMING TO JULIA.,"For my embalming, Julia, do but this; Give thou my lips but their supremest kiss, Or else transfuse thy breath into the chest Where my small relics must for ever rest; That breath the balm, the myrrh, the nard shall be, To give an incorruption unto me. "
877,328. GOLD BEFORE GOODNESS.,How rich a man is all desire to know; But none inquires if good he be or no. 
879,329. THE KISS. A DIALOGUE.,"1. Among thy fancies tell me this, What is the thing we call a kiss? 2. I shall resolve ye what it is. "
880,329. THE KISS. A DIALOGUE.,"It is a creature born and bred Between the lips (all cherry-red), By love and warm desires fed. _Chor._ And makes more soft the bridal bed. "
881,329. THE KISS. A DIALOGUE.,"2. It is an active flame that flies, First, to the babies of the eyes; And charms them there with lullabies. _Chor._ And stills the bride, too, when she cries. "
882,329. THE KISS. A DIALOGUE.,"2. Then to the chin, the cheek, the ear, It frisks and flies, now here, now there, 'Tis now far off, and then 'tis near. _Chor._ And here and there and everywhere. "
883,329. THE KISS. A DIALOGUE.,"1. Has it a speaking virtue? 2. Yes. 1. How speaks it, say? 2. Do you but this; Part your joined lips, then speaks your kiss _Chor._ And this love's sweetest language is. "
884,329. THE KISS. A DIALOGUE.,"1. Has it a body? 2. Aye, and wings With thousand rare encolourings; And, as it flies, it gently sings, _Chor._ Love honey yields, but never stings. "
886,330. THE ADMONITION.,"Seest thou those diamonds which she wears In that rich carcanet; Or those, on her dishevell'd hairs, Fair pearls in order set? Believe, young man, all those were tears By wretched wooers sent, In mournful hyacinths and rue, That figure discontent; Which when not warmed by her view, By cold neglect, each one Congeal'd to pearl and stone; Which precious spoils upon her She wears as trophies of her honour. Ah then, consider, what all this implies: She that will wear thy tears would wear thine eyes. "
889,"331. TO HIS HONOURED KINSMAN, SIR WILLIAM SOAME. EPIG.","I can but name thee, and methinks I call All that have been, or are canonical For love and bounty to come near, and see Their many virtues volum'd up in thee; In thee, brave man! whose incorrupted fame Casts forth a light like to a virgin flame; And as it shines it throws a scent about, As when a rainbow in perfumes goes out. So vanish hence, but leave a name as sweet As benjamin and storax when they meet. "
892,332. ON HIMSELF.,"Ask me why I do not sing To the tension of the string As I did not long ago, When my numbers full did flow? Grief, ay, me! hath struck my lute And my tongue, at one time, mute. "
894,333. TO LAR.,"No more shall I, since I am driven hence, Devote to thee my grains of frankincense; No more shall I from mantle-trees hang down, To honour thee, my little parsley crown; No more shall I (I fear me) to thee bring My chives of garlic for an offering; No more shall I from henceforth hear a choir Of merry crickets by my country fire. Go where I will, thou lucky Lar stay here, Warm by a glitt'ring chimney all the year. "
897,334. THE DEPARTURE OF THE GOOD DEMON.,"What can I do in poetry Now the good spirit's gone from me? Why, nothing now but lonely sit And over-read what I have writ. "
899,335. CLEMENCY.,"For punishment in war it will suffice If the chief author of the faction dies; Let but few smart, but strike a fear through all; Where the fault springs there let the judgment fall. "
900,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"336. HIS AGE, DEDICATED TO HIS PECULIAR FRIEND, M. JOHN WICKES, UNDER THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS. "
901,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Ah Posthumus! our years hence fly, And leave no sound; nor piety, Or prayers, or vow Can keep the wrinkle from the brow; But we must on, As fate does lead or draw us; none, None, Posthumus, could ere decline The doom of cruel Proserpine. "
902,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"The pleasing wife, the house, the ground, Must all be left, no one plant found To follow thee, Save only the curs'd cypress tree; A merry mind Looks forward, scorns what's left behind; Let's live, my Wickes, then, while we may, And here enjoy our holiday. "
903,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"W'ave seen the past best times, and these Will ne'er return; we see the seas And moons to wane But they fill up their ebbs again; But vanish'd man, Like to a lily lost, ne'er can, Ne'er can repullulate, or bring His days to see a second spring. "
904,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"But on we must, and thither tend, Where Anchus and rich Tullus blend Their sacred seed: Thus has infernal Jove decreed; We must be made, Ere long a song, ere long a shade. Why then, since life to us is short, Let's make it full up by our sport. "
905,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Crown we our heads with roses then, And 'noint with Tyrian balm; for when We two are dead, The world with us is buried. Then live we free As is the air, and let us be Our own fair wind, and mark each one Day with the white and lucky stone. "
906,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"We are not poor, although we have No roofs of cedar, nor our brave Baiæ, nor keep Account of such a flock of sheep; Nor bullocks fed To lard the shambles: barbels bred To kiss our hands; nor do we wish For Pollio's lampreys in our dish. "
907,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"If we can meet and so confer Both by a shining salt-cellar, And have our roof, Although not arch'd, yet weather-proof, And ceiling free From that cheap candle bawdery; We'll eat our bean with that full mirth As we were lords of all the earth. "
908,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Well then, on what seas we are toss'd, Our comfort is, we can't be lost. Let the winds drive Our barque, yet she will keep alive Amidst the deeps. 'Tis constancy, my Wickes, which keeps The pinnace up; which, though she errs I' th' seas, she saves her passengers. "
909,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Say, we must part (sweet mercy bless Us both i' th' sea, camp, wilderness), Can we so far Stray to become less circular Than we are now? No, no, that self-same heart, that vow Which made us one, shall ne'er undo, Or ravel so to make us two. "
910,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Live in thy peace; as for myself, When I am bruised on the shelf Of time, and show My locks behung with frost and snow; When with the rheum, The cough, the ptisick, I consume Unto an almost nothing; then The ages fled I'll call again, "
911,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"And with a tear compare these last Lame and bad times with those are past; While Baucis by, My old lean wife, shall kiss it dry. And so we'll sit By th' fire, foretelling snow and sleet, And weather by our aches, grown Now old enough to be our own "
912,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"True calendars, as puss's ear Washed o'er's, to tell what change is near: Then to assuage The gripings of the chine by age, I'll call my young Iülus to sing such a song I made upon my Julia's breast; And of her blush at such a feast. "
913,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Then shall he read that flower of mine, Enclos'd within a crystal shrine; A primrose next; A piece, then, of a higher text, For to beget In me a more transcendent heat Than that insinuating fire, Which crept into each aged sire, "
914,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"When the fair Helen, from her eyes, Shot forth her loving sorceries; At which I'll rear Mine aged limbs above my chair, And, hearing it, Flutter and crow as in a fit Of fresh concupiscence, and cry: _No lust there's like to poetry_. "
915,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Thus, frantic-crazy man, God wot, I'll call to mind things half-forgot, And oft between Repeat the times that I have seen! Thus ripe with tears, And twisting my Iülus' hairs, Doting, I'll weep and say, in truth, Baucis, these were my sins of youth. "
916,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Then next I'll cause my hopeful lad, If a wild apple can be had, To crown the hearth, Lar thus conspiring with our mirth; Then to infuse Our browner ale into the cruse, Which sweetly spic'd, we'll first carouse Unto the Genius of the house. "
917,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Then the next health to friends of mine, Loving the brave Burgundian wine, High sons of pith, Whose fortunes I have frolicked with; Such as could well Bear up the magic bough and spell; And dancing 'bout the mystic thyrse, Give up the just applause to verse: "
918,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"To those, and then again to thee, We'll drink, my Wickes, until we be Plump as the cherry, Though not so fresh, yet full as merry As the cricket, The untam'd heifer, or the pricket, Until our tongues shall tell our ears We're younger by a score of years. "
919,THE NAME OF POSTHUMUS.,"Thus, till we see the fire less shine From th' embers than the kitling's eyne, We'll still sit up, Sphering about the wassail-cup To all those times Which gave me honour for my rhymes. The coal once spent, we'll then to bed, Far more than night-bewearied. "

932,"341. TO THE LADY MARY VILLARS, GOVERNESS TO THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA.","When I of Villars do but hear the name, It calls to mind that mighty Buckingham, Who was your brave exalted uncle here, Binding the wheel of fortune to his sphere, Who spurned at envy, and could bring with ease An end to all his stately purposes. For his love then, whose sacred relics show Their resurrection and their growth in you; And for my sake, who ever did prefer You above all those sweets of Westminster; Permit my book to have a free access To kiss your hand, most dainty governess. "
934,342. UPON HIS JULIA.,"Will ye hear what I can say Briefly of my Julia? Black and rolling is her eye, Double-chinn'd and forehead high; Lips she has all ruby red, Cheeks like cream enclareted; And a nose that is the grace And proscenium of her face. So that we may guess by these The other parts will richly please. "
936,343. TO FLOWERS.,"In time of life I graced ye with my verse; Do now your flowery honours to my hearse. You shall not languish, trust me; virgins here Weeping shall make ye flourish all the year. "

944,347. ON JULIA'S PICTURE.,"How am I ravish'd! when I do but see The painter's art in thy sciography? If so, how much more shall I dote thereon When once he gives it incarnation? "

955,352. NOTHING NEW.,Nothing is new; we walk where others went; There's no vice now but has his precedent. 
957,353. THE RAINBOW.,"Look how the rainbow doth appear But in one only hemisphere; So likewise after our decease No more is seen the arch of peace. That cov'nant's here, the under-bow, That nothing shoots but war and woe. "

Yet ere ye enter give us leave to set Upon your head this flowery coronet; To make this neat distinction from the rest, You are the prime and princess of the feast; To which with silver feet lead you the way, While sweet-breath nymphs attend on you this day. This is your hour, and best you may command, Since you are lady of this fairy land. Full mirth wait on you, and such mirth as shall Cherish the cheek but make none blush at all. "
962,"355. THE PARTING VERSE, THE FEAST THERE ENDED.","Loth to depart, but yet at last each one Back must now go to's habitation; Not knowing thus much when we once do sever, Whether or no that we shall meet here ever. As for myself, since time a thousand cares And griefs hath filed upon my silver hairs, 'Tis to be doubted whether I next year Or no shall give ye a re-meeting here. If die I must, then my last vow shall be, You'll with a tear or two remember me. Your sometime poet; but if fates do give Me longer date and more fresh springs to live, Oft as your field shall her old age renew, Herrick shall make the meadow-verse for you. "

You who are high born, and a lord no less Free by your fate than fortune's mightiness, Who hug our poems, honour'd sir, and then The paper gild and laureate the pen. Nor suffer you the poets to sit cold, But warm their wits and turn their lines to gold. Others there be who righteously will swear Those smooth-paced numbers amble everywhere, And these brave measures go a stately trot; Love those, like these, regard, reward them not. But you, my lord, are one whose hand along Goes with your mouth or does outrun your tongue; Paying before you praise, and, cockering wit, Give both the gold and garland unto it. "

"
996,377. A PANEGYRIC TO SIR LEWIS PEMBERTON.,"Till I shall come again let this suffice, I send my salt, my sacrifice To thee, thy lady, younglings, and as far As to thy Genius and thy Lar; To the worn threshold, porch, hall, parlour, kitchen, The fat-fed smoking temple, which in The wholesome savour of thy mighty chines Invites to supper him who dines, Where laden spits, warp'd with large ribs of beef, Not represent but give relief To the lank stranger and the sour swain, Where both may feed and come again; For no black-bearded vigil from thy door Beats with a button'd-staff the poor; But from thy warm love-hatching gates each may Take friendly morsels and there stay To sun his thin-clad members if he likes, For thou no porter keep'st who strikes. No comer to thy roof his guest-rite wants, Or staying there is scourg'd with taunts Of some rough groom, who, yirkt with corns, says: ""Sir, Y'ave dipped too long i' th' vinegar; And with our broth, and bread, and bits, sir friend, Y'ave fared well: pray make an end; Two days y'ave larded here; a third, ye know, Makes guests and fish smell strong; pray go You to some other chimney, and there take Essay of other giblets; make Merry at another's hearth--y'are here Welcome as thunder to our beer; Manners know distance, and a man unrude Would soon recoil and not intrude His stomach to a second meal"". No, no! Thy house well fed and taught can show No such crabb'd vizard: thou hast learnt thy train With heart and hand to entertain, And by the armsful, with a breast unhid, As the old race of mankind did, When either's heart and either's hand did strive To be the nearer relative. Thou dost redeem those times, and what was lost Of ancient honesty may boast It keeps a growth in thee, and so will run A course in thy fame's pledge, thy son. Thus, like a Roman tribune, thou thy gate Early sets ope to feast and late; Keeping no currish waiter to affright With blasting eye the appetite, Which fain would waste upon thy cates, but that The trencher-creature marketh what Best and more suppling piece he cuts, and by Some private pinch tells danger's nigh A hand too desp'rate, or a knife that bites Skin-deep into the pork, or lights Upon some part of kid, as if mistook, When checked by the butler's look. No, no; thy bread, thy wine, thy jocund beer Is not reserved for Trebius here, But all who at thy table seated are Find equal freedom, equal fare; And thou, like to that hospitable god, Jove, joy'st when guests make their abode To eat thy bullock's thighs, thy veals, thy fat Wethers, and never grudged at. The _pheasant_, _partridge_, _gotwit_, _reeve_, _ruff_, _rail_, The _cock_, the _curlew_ and the _quail_, These and thy choicest viands do extend Their taste unto the lower end Of thy glad table: not a dish more known To thee than unto anyone. But as thy meat so thy _immortal wine_ Makes the smirk face of each to shine And spring fresh rosebuds, while the salt, the wit, Flows from the wine and graces it; While reverence, waiting at the bashful board, Honours my lady and my lord. No scurril jest; no open scene is laid Here for to make the face afraid; But temperate mirth dealt forth, and so discreet- ly that it makes the meat more sweet; And adds perfumes unto the wine, which thou Dost rather pour forth than allow By cruse and measure; thus devoting wine As the Canary Isles were thine; But with that wisdom and that method, as No one that's there his guilty glass Drinks of distemper, or has cause to cry Repentance to his liberty. No, thou knowest order, ethics, and has read All economics, know'st to lead A house-dance neatly, and canst truly show How far a figure ought to go, Forward or backward, sideward, and what pace Can give, and what retract a grace; What gesture, courtship, comeliness agrees With those thy primitive decrees, To give subsistence to thy house, and proof What Genii support thy roof, Goodness and Greatness; not the oaken piles; _For these and marbles have their whiles To last, but not their ever_; virtue's hand It is which builds 'gainst fate to stand. Such is thy house, whose firm foundation's trust Is more in thee than in her dust Or depth; these last may yield and yearly shrink When what is strongly built, no chink Or yawning rupture can the same devour, But fix'd it stands, by her own power And well-laid bottom, on the iron and rock Which tries and counter-stands the shock And ram of time, and by vexation grows The stronger; _virtue dies when foes Are wanting to her exercise, but great And large she spreads by dust and sweat_. Safe stand thy walls and thee, and so both will, Since neither's height was rais'd by th' ill Of others; since no stud, no stone, no piece Was rear'd up by the poor man's fleece; No widow's tenement was rack'd to gild Or fret thy ceiling or to build A sweating-closet to anoint the silk- soft skin, or bathe in asses' milk; No orphan's pittance left him serv'd to set The pillars up of lasting jet, For which their cries might beat against thine ears, Or in the damp jet read their tears. No plank from hallowed altar does appeal To yond' Star-Chamber, or does seal A curse to thee or thine; but all things even Make for thy peace and pace to heaven. Go on directly so, as just men may A thousand times more swear than say: This is that princely Pemberton who can Teach man to keep a god in man; And when wise poets shall search out to see Good men, they find them all in thee.

1001,382. UPON M. BEN. JONSON. EPIG.,"After the rare arch-poet, Jonson, died, The sock grew loathsome, and the buskin's pride, Together with the stage's glory, stood Each like a poor and pitied widowhood. The cirque profan'd was, and all postures rack'd; For men did strut, and stride, and stare, not act. Then temper flew from words, and men did squeak, Look red, and blow, and bluster, but not speak; No holy rage or frantic fires did stir Or flash about the spacious theatre. No clap of hands, or shout, or praise's proof Did crack the play-house sides, or cleave her roof. Artless the scene was, and that monstrous sin Of deep and arrant ignorance came in: Such ignorance as theirs was who once hiss'd At thy unequall'd play, the _Alchemist_; Oh, fie upon 'em! Lastly, too, all wit In utter darkness did, and still will sit, Sleeping the luckless age out, till that she Her resurrection has again with thee. "

Three quarters were consum'd of it; Only remained a little bit, Which will be burnt up by-and-by; Then, Julia, weep, for I must die. "
1036,402. CLOTHES DO BUT CHEAT AND COZEN US.,"Away with silks, away with lawn, I'll have no scenes or curtains drawn; Give me my mistress as she is, Dress'd in her nak'd simplicities; For as my heart e'en so mine eye Is won with flesh, not drapery. "

Like to a field of beans when newly blown, Or like a meadow being lately mown. _Mon._ A sweet-sad passion---- _Mir._ In dewy mornings when she came this way Sweet bents would bow to give my love the day; And when at night she folded had her sheep, Daisies would shut, and, closing, sigh and weep.

But she is gone. _Sil._ Mirtillo, tell us whither. _Mir._ Where she and I shall never meet together. _Mon._ Forfend it Pan, and, Pales, do thou please To give an end. _Mir._ To what? _Sil._ Such griefs as these. _Mir._ Never, O never! Still I may endure The wound I suffer, never find a cure. _Mon._ Love for thy sake will bring her to these hills And dales again. _Mir._ No, I will languish still; And all the while my part shall be to weep, And with my sighs, call home my bleating sheep: And in the rind of every comely tree I'll carve thy name, and in that name kiss thee. _Mon._ Set with the sun thy woes. _Sil._ The day grows old, And time it is our full-fed flocks to fold. _Chor._ The shades grow great, but greater grows our sorrow; But let's go steep Our eyes in sleep, And meet to weep To-morrow.

This, this it should be: for to spin A lawn for me, so fine and thin As it might serve me for my skin. For cruel Love has me so whipp'd That of my skin I all am stripp'd: And shall despair that any art Can ease the rawness or the smart, Unless you skin again each part. Which mercy if you will but do, I call all maids to witness to What here I promise: that no broom Shall now or ever after come To wrong a spinner or her loom. "
1108,443. OBERON'S PALACE.,"After the feast, my Shapcot, see The fairy court I give to thee; Where we'll present our Oberon, led Half-tipsy to the fairy bed, Where Mab he finds, who there doth lie, Not without mickle majesty. Which done, and thence remov'd the light, We'll wish both them and thee good-night. "
1109,443. OBERON'S PALACE.,"Full as a bee with thyme, and red As cherry harvest, now high fed For lust and action, on he'll go To lie with Mab, though all say no. Lust has no ears; he's sharp as thorn, And fretful, carries hay in's horn, And lightning in his eyes; and flings Among the elves, if moved, the stings Of peltish wasps; well know his guard-- _Kings, though they're hated, will be fear'd_. Wine lead[s] him on. Thus to a grove, Sometimes devoted unto love, Tinselled with twilight, he and they, Led by the shine of snails, a way Beat with their num'rous feet, which, by Many a neat perplexity, Many a turn and many a cross- Track they redeem a bank of moss, Spongy and swelling, and far more Soft than the finest Lemster ore, Mildly disparkling like those fires Which break from the enjewell'd tyres Of curious brides; or like those mites Of candi'd dew in moony nights. Upon this convex all the flowers Nature begets by th' sun and showers, Are to a wild digestion brought, As if love's sampler here was wrought: Or Citherea's ceston, which All with temptation doth bewitch. Sweet airs move here, and more divine Made by the breath of great-eyed kine, Who, as they low, impearl with milk The four-leaved grass or moss like silk. The breath of monkeys met to mix With musk-flies are th' aromatics Which 'cense this arch; and here and there And farther off, and everywhere Throughout that brave mosaic yard, Those picks or diamonds in the card With peeps of hearts, of club, and spade Are here most neatly inter-laid Many a counter, many a die, Half-rotten and without an eye Lies hereabouts; and, for to pave The excellency of this cave, Squirrels' and children's teeth late shed Are neatly here enchequered With brownest toadstones, and the gum That shines upon the bluer plum. The nails fallen off by whitflaws: art's Wise hand enchasing here those warts Which we to others, from ourselves, Sell, and brought hither by the elves. The tempting mole, stolen from the neck Of the shy virgin, seems to deck The holy entrance, where within The room is hung with the blue skin Of shifted snake: enfriez'd throughout With eyes of peacocks' trains and trout- Flies' curious wings; and these among Those silver pence that cut the tongue Of the red infant, neatly hung. The glow-worm's eyes; the shining scales Of silv'ry fish; wheat straws, the snail's Soft candle light; the kitling's eyne; Corrupted wood; serve here for shine. No glaring light of bold-fac'd day, Or other over-radiant ray, Ransacks this room; but what weak beams Can make reflected from these gems And multiply; such is the light, But ever doubtful day or night. By this quaint taper light he winds His errors up; and now he finds His moon-tann'd Mab, as somewhat sick, And (love knows) tender as a chick. Upon six plump dandillions, high- Rear'd, lies her elvish majesty: Whose woolly bubbles seem'd to drown Her Mabship in obedient down. For either sheet was spread the caul That doth the infant's face enthral, When it is born (by some enstyl'd The lucky omen of the child), And next to these two blankets o'er- Cast of the finest gossamore. And then a rug of carded wool, Which, sponge-like drinking in the dull Light of the moon, seemed to comply, Cloud-like, the dainty deity. Thus soft she lies: and overhead A spinner's circle is bespread With cob-web curtains, from the roof So neatly sunk as that no proof Of any tackling can declare What gives it hanging in the air. The fringe about this are those threads Broke at the loss of maidenheads: And, all behung with these, pure pearls, Dropp'd from the eyes of ravish'd girls Or writhing brides; when (panting) they Give unto love the straiter way. For music now, he has the cries Of feigned-lost virginities; The which the elves make to excite A more unconquered appetite. The king's undrest; and now upon The gnat's watchword the elves are gone. And now the bed, and Mab possess'd Of this great little kingly guest; We'll nobly think, what's to be done, He'll do no doubt; _this flax is spun_. "

Give way, give way to me, who come Scorch'd with the self-same martyrdom: And have deserv'd as much (love knows) As to be canonis'd 'mongst those Whose deeds and deaths here written are Within your greeny calendar: By all those virgins' fillets hung Upon your boughs, and requiems sung For saints and souls departed hence (Here honour'd still with frankincense); By all those tears that have been shed, As a drink-offering to the dead; By all those true love-knots that be With mottoes carv'd on every tree; By sweet Saint Phyllis pity me: By dear Saint Iphis, and the rest Of all those other saints now blest, Me, me, forsaken, here admit Among your myrtles to be writ: That my poor name may have the glory To live remembered in your story.

Of whom, from fame's white trumpet, this I'll tell, Worthy their everlasting chronicle: Never since first Bellona us'd a shield, _Such three brave brothers fell in Mars his field_. These were those three Horatii Rome did boast, Rome's were these three Horatii we have lost. One Cœur-de-Lion had that age long since; This, three; which three, you make up four, brave prince. "

TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE MILDMAY, EARL OF WESTMORELAND.","You are a lord, an earl, nay more, a man Who writes sweet numbers well as any can; If so, why then are not these verses hurled, Like Sybil's leaves, throughout the ample world? What is a jewel if it be not set Forth by a ring or some rich carcanet? But being so, then the beholders cry: See, see a gem as rare as Belus' eye. Then public praise does run upon the stone, For a most rich, a rare, a precious one. Expose your jewels then unto the view, That we may praise them, or themselves prize you. _Virtue concealed_, with Horace you'll confess, _Differs not much from drowsy slothfulness_. "

1157,465. THE PARTING VERSE OR CHARGE TO HIS SUPPOSED WIFE WHEN HE TRAVELLED.,"Go hence, and with this parting kiss, Which joins two souls, remember this: Though thou be'st young, kind, soft, and fair And may'st draw thousands with a hair; Yet let these glib temptations be Furies to others, friends to me. Look upon all, and though on fire Thou set their hearts, let chaste desire Steer thee to me, and think, me gone, In having all, that thou hast none. Nor so immured would I have Thee live, as dead and in thy grave; But walk abroad, yet wisely well Stand for my coming, sentinel. And think, as thou do'st walk the street, Me or my shadow thou do'st meet. I know a thousand greedy eyes Will on thy feature tyrannise In my short absence, yet behold Them like some picture, or some mould Fashion'd like thee, which, though 't have ears And eyes, it neither sees or hears. Gifts will be sent, and letters, which Are the expressions of that itch, And salt, which frets thy suitors; fly Both, lest thou lose thy liberty; For, that once lost, thou't fall to one, Then prostrate to a million. But if they woo thee, do thou say, As that chaste Queen of Ithaca Did to her suitors, this web done, (Undone as oft as done), I'm won; I will not urge thee, for I know, Though thou art young, thou canst say no, And no again, and so deny Those thy lust-burning incubi. Let them enstyle thee fairest fair, The pearl of princes, yet despair That so thou art, because thou must Believe love speaks it not, but lust; And this their flattery does commend Thee chiefly for their pleasure's end. I am not jealous of thy faith, Or will be, for the axiom saith: He that doth suspect does haste A gentle mind to be unchaste. No, live thee to thy self, and keep Thy thoughts as cold as is thy sleep, And let thy dreams be only fed With this, that I am in thy bed; And thou, then turning in that sphere, Waking shalt find me sleeping there. But yet if boundless lust must scale Thy fortress, and will needs prevail, And wildly force a passage in, Banish consent, and 'tis no sin Of thine; so Lucrece fell and the Chaste Syracusian Cyane. So Medullina fell; yet none Of these had imputation For the least trespass, 'cause the mind Here was not with the act combin'd. _The body sins not, 'tis the will That makes the action, good or ill._ And if thy fall should this way come, Triumph in such a martyrdom. I will not over-long enlarge To thee this my religious charge. Take this compression, so by this Means I shall know what other kiss Is mixed with mine, and truly know, Returning, if't be mine or no: Keep it till then; and now, my spouse, For my wished safety pay thy vows And prayers to Venus; if it please The great blue ruler of the seas, Not many full-faced moons shall wane, Lean-horn'd, before I come again As one triumphant, when I find In thee all faith of womankind. Nor would I have thee think that thou Had'st power thyself to keep this vow, But, having 'scaped temptation's shelf, Know virtue taught thee, not thyself. "
1158,465. THE PARTING VERSE OR CHARGE TO HIS SUPPOSED WIFE WHEN HE TRAVELLED.,"_Queen of Ithaca_, Penelope. _Incubi_, adulterous spirits. _Cyane_, a nymph of Syracuse, ravished by her father whom (and herself) she slew. _Medullina_, a Roman virgin who endured a like fate. _Compression_, embrace. "

1253,497. UPON A FLY.,"A golden fly one show'd to me, Clos'd in a box of ivory, Where both seem'd proud: the fly to have His burial in an ivory grave; The ivory took state to hold A corpse as bright as burnish'd gold. One fate had both, both equal grace; The buried, and the burying-place. Not Virgil's gnat, to whom the spring All flowers sent to's burying; Not Martial's bee, which in a bead Of amber quick was buried; Nor that fine worm that does inter Herself i' th' silken sepulchre; Nor my rare Phil,[K] that lately was With lilies tomb'd up in a glass; More honour had than this same fly, Dead, and closed up in ivory.

1259,500. TO MISTRESS DOROTHY PARSONS.,"If thou ask me, dear, wherefore I do write of thee no more, I must answer, sweet, thy part Less is here than in my heart. "
1261,502. HOW HE WOULD DRINK HIS WINE.,"Fill me my wine in crystal; thus, and thus I see't in's _puris naturalibus_: Unmix'd. I love to have it smirk and shine; _'Tis sin I know, 'tis sin to throttle wine_. What madman's he, that when it sparkles so, Will cool his flames or quench his fires with snow? "
1263,503. HOW MARIGOLDS CAME YELLOW.,"Jealous girls these sometimes were, While they liv'd or lasted here: Turn'd to flowers, still they be Yellow, mark'd for jealousy. "
1265,504. THE BROKEN CRYSTAL.,"To fetch me wine my Lucia went, Bearing a crystal continent: But, making haste, it came to pass She brake in two the purer glass, Then smil'd, and sweetly chid her speed; So with a blush beshrew'd the deed. "
1268,505. PRECEPTS.,"Good precepts we must firmly hold, By daily learning we wax old. "
1270,"506. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE EDWARD, EARL OF DORSET.","If I dare write to you, my lord, who are Of your own self a public theatre, And, sitting, see the wiles, ways, walks of wit, And give a righteous judgment upon it, What need I care, though some dislike me should, If Dorset say what Herrick writes is good? We know y'are learn'd i' th' Muses, and no less In our state-sanctions, deep or bottomless. Whose smile can make a poet, and your glance Dash all bad poems out of countenance; So that an author needs no other bays For coronation than your only praise, And no one mischief greater than your frown To null his numbers, and to blast his crown. _Few live the life immortal. He ensures His fame's long life who strives to set up yours._ "
1272,507. UPON HIMSELF.,"Thou'rt hence removing (like a shepherd's tent), And walk thou must the way that others went: Fall thou must first, then rise to life with these, Mark'd in thy book for faithful witnesses. "
1273,"508. HOPE WELL AND HAVE WELL: OR, FAIR AFTER FOUL WEATHER.","508. HOPE WELL AND HAVE WELL: OR, FAIR AFTER FOUL WEATHER. "
1274,"508. HOPE WELL AND HAVE WELL: OR, FAIR AFTER FOUL WEATHER.","What though the heaven be lowering now, And look with a contracted brow? We shall discover, by-and-by, A repurgation of the sky; And when those clouds away are driven, Then will appear a cheerful heaven. "
1276,509. UPON LOVE.,"I held Love's head while it did ache; But so it chanc'd to be, The cruel pain did his forsake, And forthwith came to me. "
1277,509. UPON LOVE.,"Ay me! how shall my grief be still'd? Or where else shall we find One like to me, who must be kill'd For being too-too kind? "
1279,"510. TO HIS KINSWOMAN, MRS. PENELOPE WHEELER.","Next is your lot, fair, to be number'd one, Here, in my book's canonisation: Late you come in; but you a saint shall be, In chief, in this poetic liturgy. "
1281,511. ANOTHER UPON HER.,"First, for your shape, the curious cannot show Any one part that's dissonant in you: And 'gainst your chaste behaviour there's no plea, Since you are known to be Penelope. Thus fair and clean you are, although there be _A mighty strife 'twixt form and chastity_. "
1284,513. CROSS AND PILE.,Fair and foul days trip cross and pile; the fair Far less in number than our foul days are. 
1285,513. CROSS AND PILE.,"_Trip cross and pile_, come haphazard, like the heads and tails of coins. "
1286,"514. TO THE LADY CREW, UPON THE DEATH OF HER CHILD.","514. TO THE LADY CREW, UPON THE DEATH OF HER CHILD. "
1287,"514. TO THE LADY CREW, UPON THE DEATH OF HER CHILD.","Why, madam, will ye longer weep, Whenas your baby's lull'd asleep? And (pretty child) feels now no more Those pains it lately felt before. All now is silent; groans are fled: Your child lies still, yet is not dead; But rather like a flower hid here To spring again another year. "
1289,515. HIS WINDING-SHEET.,"Come thou, who art the wine and wit Of all I've writ: The grace, the glory, and the best Piece of the rest. Thou art of what I did intend The all and end; And what was made, was made to meet Thee, thee, my sheet. Come then, and be to my chaste side Both bed and bride. We two, as reliques left, will have One rest, one grave. And, hugging close, we will not fear Lust entering here, Where all desires are dead or cold As is the mould; And all affections are forgot, Or trouble not. Here, here the slaves and pris'ners be From shackles free: And weeping widows long oppress'd Do here find rest. The wronged client ends his laws Here, and his cause. Here those long suits of chancery lie Quiet, or die: And all Star-Chamber bills do cease, Or hold their peace. Here needs no Court for our Request, Where all are best, All wise, all equal, and all just Alike i' th' dust. Nor need we here to fear the frown Of court or crown: _Where fortune bears no sway o'er things, There all are kings_. In this securer place we'll keep, As lull'd asleep; Or for a little time we'll lie As robes laid by; To be another day re-worn, Turn'd, but not torn: Or, like old testaments engrost, Lock'd up, not lost. And for a while lie here conceal'd, To be reveal'd Next at that great Platonick year, And then meet here. "
1290,515. HIS WINDING-SHEET.,"_Platonick year_, the 36,000th year, in which all persons and things return to their original state. "
1292,516. TO MISTRESS MARY WILLAND.,"One more by thee, love, and desert have sent, T' enspangle this expansive firmament. O flame of beauty! come, appear, appear A virgin taper, ever shining here. "
1294,517. CHANGE GIVES CONTENT.,What now we like anon we disapprove: _The new successor drives away old love_. 
1296,519. ON HIMSELF.,"Born I was to meet with age, And to walk life's pilgrimage. Much I know of time is spent, Tell I can't what's resident. Howsoever, cares, adieu! I'll have nought to say to you: But I'll spend my coming hours Drinking wine and crown'd with flowers. "
1299,520. FORTUNE FAVOURS.,"Fortune did never favour one Fully, without exception; Though free she be, there's something yet Still wanting to her favourite. "
1301,"521. TO PHYLLIS, TO LOVE AND LIVE WITH HIM.","Live, live with me, and thou shall see The pleasures I'll prepare for thee; What sweets the country can afford Shall bless thy bed and bless thy board. The soft, sweet moss shall be thy bed With crawling woodbine over-spread; By which the silver-shedding streams Shall gently melt thee into dreams. Thy clothing, next, shall be a gown Made of the fleece's purest down. The tongues of kids shall be thy meat, Their milk thy drink; and thou shalt eat The paste of filberts for thy bread, With cream of cowslips buttered; Thy feasting-tables shall be hills With daisies spread and daffodils, Where thou shalt sit, and red-breast by, For meat, shall give thee melody. I'll give thee chains and carcanets Of primroses and violets. A bag and bottle thou shalt have, That richly wrought, and this as brave; So that as either shall express The wearer's no mean shepherdess. At shearing-times, and yearly wakes, When Themilis his pastime makes, There thou shalt be; and be the wit, Nay, more, the feast, and grace of it. On holidays, when virgins meet To dance the heyes with nimble feet, Thou shall come forth, and then appear The queen of roses for that year; And having danced, 'bove all the best, Carry the garland from the rest. In wicker baskets maids shall bring To thee, my dearest shepherling, The blushing apple, bashful pear, And shame-fac'd plum, all simp'ring there. Walk in the groves, and thou shalt find The name of Phyllis in the rind Of every straight and smooth-skin tree; Where kissing that, I'll twice kiss thee. To thee a sheep-hook I will send, Be-prank'd with ribands to this end; This, this alluring hook might be Less for to catch a sheep than me. Thou shalt have possets, wassails fine, Not made of ale, but spiced wine, To make thy maids and self free mirth, All sitting near the glitt'ring hearth. Thou shalt have ribands, roses, rings, Gloves, garters, stockings, shoes, and strings Of winning colours, that shall move Others to lust, but me to love. These, nay, and more, thine own shall be If thou wilt love, and live with me. "
1302,"521. TO PHYLLIS, TO LOVE AND LIVE WITH HIM.","_Carcanets_, necklaces. _Wakes_, village feasts on the dedication day of the church. _The heyes_, a winding, country dance. _Be-prank'd_, be-decked. "
1304,"522. TO HIS KINSWOMAN, MISTRESS SUSANNA HERRICK.","When I consider, dearest, thou dost stay But here a-while, to languish and decay, Like to these garden-glories, which here be The flowery-sweet resemblances of thee; With grief of heart, methinks, I thus do cry: Would thou hadst ne'er been born, or might'st not die. "
1306,"523. UPON MISTRESS SUSANNA SOUTHWELL, HER CHEEKS.","Rare are thy cheeks, Susanna, which do show Ripe cherries smiling, while that others blow. "
1308,524. UPON HER EYES.,"Clear are her eyes, Like purest skies, Discovering from thence A baby there That turns each sphere, Like an Intelligence. "
1309,524. UPON HER EYES.,"_A baby_, see Note to 38, ""To his mistress objecting to him neither toying nor talking"". "
1311,525. UPON HER FEET.,"Her pretty feet Like snails did creep A little out, and then, As if they played at Bo-Peep, Did soon draw in again. "
1313,"526. TO HIS HONOURED FRIEND, SIR JOHN MINCE.","For civil, clean, and circumcised wit, And for the comely carriage of it, Thou art the man, the only man best known, Mark'd for the true wit of a million: From whom we'll reckon. Wit came in but since The calculation of thy birth, brave Mince. "
1315,527. UPON HIS GREY HAIRS.,"Fly me not, though I be grey: Lady, this I know you'll say; Better look the roses red When with white commingled. Black your hairs are, mine are white; This begets the more delight, When things meet most opposite: As in pictures we descry Venus standing Vulcan by. "
1317,528. ACCUSATION.,"If accusation only can draw blood, None shall be guiltless, be he ne'er so good. "
1319,529. PRIDE ALLOWABLE IN POETS.,"As thou deserv'st, be proud; then gladly let The Muse give thee the Delphic coronet. "
1321,530. A VOW TO MINERVA.,"Goddess, I begin an art; Come thou in, with thy best part For to make the texture lie Each way smooth and civilly; And a broad-fac'd owl shall be Offer'd up with vows to thee. "
1322,530. A VOW TO MINERVA.,"_Civilly_, orderly. _Owl_, the bird sacred to Athene or Minerva. "
1324,534. TO ELECTRA.,"'Tis evening, my sweet, And dark, let us meet; Long time w'ave here been a-toying, And never, as yet, That season could get Wherein t'ave had an enjoying. "
1325,534. TO ELECTRA.,"For pity or shame, Then let not love's flame Be ever and ever a-spending; Since now to the port The path is but short, And yet our way has no ending. "
1326,534. TO ELECTRA.,"Time flies away fast, Our hours do waste, The while we never remember How soon our life, here, Grows old with the year That dies with the next December. "
1328,535. DISCORD NOT DISADVANTAGEOUS.,Fortune no higher project can devise Than to sow discord 'mongst the enemies. 
1330,536. ILL GOVERNMENT.,"Preposterous is that government, and rude, When kings obey the wilder multitude. "
1333,537. TO MARIGOLDS.,"Give way, and be ye ravish'd by the sun, And hang the head whenas the act is done, Spread as he spreads, wax less as he does wane; And as he shuts, close up to maids again. "
1335,538. TO DIANEME.,"Give me one kiss And no more: If so be this Makes you poor, To enrich you, I'll restore For that one two Thousand score. "
1337,"539. TO JULIA, THE FLAMINICA DIALIS OR QUEEN-PRIEST.","Thou know'st, my Julia, that it is thy turn This morning's incense to prepare and burn. The chaplet and Inarculum[L] here be, With the white vestures, all attending thee. This day the queen-priest thou art made, t' appease Love for our very many trespasses. One chief transgression is, among the rest, Because with flowers her temple was not dressed; The next, because her altars did not shine With daily fires; the last, neglect of wine; For which her wrath is gone forth to consume Us all, unless preserved by thy perfume. Take then thy censer, put in fire, and thus, O pious priestess! make a peace for us. For our neglect Love did our death decree; That we escape. _Redemption comes by thee_. "
1338,"539. TO JULIA, THE FLAMINICA DIALIS OR QUEEN-PRIEST.","[L] A twig of a pomegranate, which the queen-priest did use to wear on her head at sacrificing. (Note in the original edition.) "
1340,540. ANACREONTIC.,"Born I was to be old, And for to die here: After that, in the mould Long for to lie here. But before that day comes Still I be bousing, For I know in the tombs There's no carousing. "
1342,541. MEAT WITHOUT MIRTH.,"Eaten I have; and though I had good cheer, I did not sup, because no friends were there. Where mirth and friends are absent when we dine Or sup, there wants the incense and the wine. "
1344,542. LARGE BOUNDS DO BUT BURY US.,"All things o'er-ruled are here by chance: The greatest man's inheritance, Where'er the lucky lot doth fall, Serves but for place of burial. "
1346,543. UPON URSLEY.,"Ursley, she thinks those velvet patches grace The candid temples of her comely face; But he will say, whoe'er those circlets seeth, They be but signs of Ursley's hollow teeth. "
1348,544. AN ODE TO SIR CLIPSEBY CREW.,"Here we securely live and eat The cream of meat, And keep eternal fires, By which we sit, and do divine As wine And rage inspires. "
1349,544. AN ODE TO SIR CLIPSEBY CREW.,"If full we charm, then call upon Anacreon To grace the frantic thyrse; And having drunk, we raise a shout Throughout To praise his verse. "
1350,544. AN ODE TO SIR CLIPSEBY CREW.,"Then cause we Horace to be read, Which sung, or said, A goblet to the brim Of lyric wine, both swell'd and crown'd, Around We quaff to him. "
1351,544. AN ODE TO SIR CLIPSEBY CREW.,"Thus, thus we live, and spend the hours In wine and flowers, And make the frolic year, The month, the week, the instant day To stay The longer here. "
1352,544. AN ODE TO SIR CLIPSEBY CREW.,"Come then, brave knight, and see the cell Wherein I dwell, And my enchantments too, Which love and noble freedom is; And this Shall fetter you. "
1353,544. AN ODE TO SIR CLIPSEBY CREW.,"Take horse, and come, or be so kind To send your mind, Though but in numbers few, And I shall think I have the heart, Or part Of Clipseby Crew. "
1354,544. AN ODE TO SIR CLIPSEBY CREW.,"_Securely_, free from care. _Thyrse_, a Bacchic staff. _Instant_, oncoming. _Numbers_, verses. "
1356,"545. TO HIS WORTHY KINSMAN, MR. STEPHEN SOAME.","Nor is my number full till I inscribe Thee, sprightly Soame, one of my righteous tribe; A tribe of one lip, leaven, and of one Civil behaviour, and religion; A stock of saints, where ev'ry one doth wear A stole of white, and canonised here; Among which holies be thou ever known, Brave kinsman, mark'd out with the whiter stone Which seals thy glory, since I do prefer Thee here in my eternal calender. "
1358,546. TO HIS TOMB-MAKER.,"Go I must; when I am gone, Write but this upon my stone: Chaste I lived, without a wife, That's the story of my life. Strewings need none, every flower Is in this word, bachelour. "
1360,547. GREAT SPIRITS SUPERVIVE.,Our mortal parts may wrapp'd in sear-cloths lie: _Great spirits never with their bodies die_. 
1362,548. NONE FREE FROM FAULT.,"Out of the world he must, who once comes in. _No man exempted is from death, or sin._ "
1364,549. UPON HIMSELF BEING BURIED.,"Let me sleep this night away, Till the dawning of the day; Then at th' opening of mine eyes I, and all the world, shall rise. "
1366,550. PITY TO THE PROSTRATE.,'Tis worse than barbarous cruelty to show No part of pity on a conquered foe. 
1368,552. HIS CONTENT IN THE COUNTRY.,"Here, here I live with what my board Can with the smallest cost afford. Though ne'er so mean the viands be, They well content my Prew and me. Or pea, or bean, or wort, or beet, Whatever comes, content makes sweet. Here we rejoice, because no rent We pay for our poor tenement, Wherein we rest, and never fear The landlord or the usurer. The quarter-day does ne'er affright Our peaceful slumbers in the night. We eat our own and batten more, Because we feed on no man's score; But pity those whose flanks grow great, Swell'd with the lard of others' meat. We bless our fortunes when we see Our own beloved privacy; And like our living, where we're known To very few, or else to none. "
1371,553. THE CREDIT OF THE CONQUEROR.,"He who commends the vanquished, speaks the power And glorifies the worthy conqueror. "
1373,554. ON HIMSELF.,"Some parts may perish, die thou canst not all: The most of thee shall 'scape the funeral. "
1375,556. THE FAIRIES.,"If ye will with Mab find grace, Set each platter in his place; Rake the fire up, and get Water in, ere sun be set. Wash your pails, and cleanse your dairies; Sluts are loathsome to the fairies; Sweep your house, who doth not so, Mab will pinch her by the toe. "
1377,"557. TO HIS HONOURED FRIEND, M. JOHN WEARE, COUNCILLOR.","Did I or love, or could I others draw To the indulgence of the rugged law, The first foundation of that zeal should be By reading all her paragraphs in thee, Who dost so fitly with the laws unite, As if you two were one hermaphrodite. Nor courts[t] thou her because she's well attended With wealth, but for those ends she was intended: Which were,--and still her offices are known,-- _Law is to give to ev'ry one his own_; To shore the feeble up against the strong, To shield the stranger and the poor from wrong. This was the founder's grave and good intent: To keep the outcast in his tenement, To free the orphan from that wolf-like man, Who is his butcher more than guardian; To dry the widow's tears, and stop her swoons, By pouring balm and oil into her wounds. This was the old way; and 'tis yet thy course To keep those pious principles in force. Modest I will be; but one word I'll say, Like to a sound that's vanishing away, Sooner the inside of thy hand shall grow Hisped and hairy, ere thy palm shall know A postern-bribe took, or a forked fee, To fetter Justice, when she might be free. _Eggs I'll not shave_; but yet, brave man, if I Was destin'd forth to golden sovereignty, A prince I'd be, that I might thee prefer To be my counsel both and chancellor. "
1378,"557. TO HIS HONOURED FRIEND, M. JOHN WEARE, COUNCILLOR.","_Hisped_ (_hispidus_), rough with hairs. _Postern-bribe_, a back-door bribe. _Forked fee_, a fee from both sides in a case; cp. Ben Jonson's _Volpone_: ""Give forked counsel, take provoking gold on either hand"". _Eggs I'll not shave_, a proverb. "
1380,560. THE WATCH.,"Man is a watch, wound up at first, but never Wound up again: once down, he's down for ever. The watch once down, all motions then do cease; And man's pulse stop'd, all passions sleep in peace. "
1382,"561. LINES HAVE THEIR LININGS, AND BOOKS THEIR BUCKRAM.","As in our clothes, so likewise he who looks, Shall find much farcing buckram in our books. "
1385,562. ART ABOVE NATURE: TO JULIA.,"When I behold a forest spread With silken trees upon thy head, And when I see that other dress Of flowers set in comeliness; When I behold another grace In the ascent of curious lace, Which like a pinnacle doth show The top, and the top-gallant too. Then, when I see thy tresses bound Into an oval, square, or round, And knit in knots far more than I Can tell by tongue, or true-love tie; Next, when those lawny films I see Play with a wild civility, And all those airy silks to flow, Alluring me, and tempting so: I must confess mine eye and heart Dotes less on Nature than on Art. "
1388,"564. UPON HIS KINSWOMAN, MISTRESS BRIDGET HERRICK.","Sweet Bridget blush'd, and therewithal Fresh blossoms from her cheeks did fall. I thought at first 'twas but a dream, Till after I had handled them And smelt them, then they smelt to me As blossoms of the almond tree. "
1390,565. UPON LOVE.,"I played with Love, as with the fire The wanton Satyr did; Nor did I know, or could descry What under there was hid. "
1391,565. UPON LOVE.,"That Satyr he but burnt his lips; But mine's the greater smart, For kissing Love's dissembling chips The fire scorch'd my heart. "
1394,566. UPON A COMELY AND CURIOUS MAID.,"If men can say that beauty dies, Marbles will swear that here it lies. If, reader, then thou canst forbear In public loss to shed a tear, The dew of grief upon this stone Will tell thee pity thou hast none. "
1396,567. UPON THE LOSS OF HIS FINGER.,"One of the five straight branches of my hand Is lop'd already, and the rest but stand Expecting when to fall, which soon will be; First dies the leaf, the bough next, next the tree. "
1398,568. UPON IRENE.,"Angry if Irene be But a minute's life with me: Such a fire I espy Walking in and out her eye, As at once I freeze and fry. "
1400,569. UPON ELECTRA'S TEARS.,"Upon her cheeks she wept, and from those showers Sprang up a sweet nativity of flowers. "
1403,NOTES.,"2. _Whither, mad maiden_, etc. From Martial, I. iv. 11, 12:-- "
1404,NOTES.,"Aetherias, lascive, cupis volitare per auras: I, fuge; sed poteras tutior esse domi. "
1405,NOTES.,"_But for the Court._ Cp. Martial, I. iv. 3, 4. "
1406,NOTES.,"4. _While Brutus standeth by._ ""Brutus and Cato are commonplaces of examples of severe virtue"": Grosart. But Herrick is translating. This is from Martial, XI. xvi. 9, 10:-- "
1407,NOTES.,"Erubuit posuitque meum Lucretia librum, Sed coram Bruto; Brute, recede, leget. "
1408,NOTES.,"8. _When he would have his verses read._ The thought throughout this poem is taken from Martial, X. xix., beginning:-- "
1409,NOTES.,"Nec doctum satis et parum severum, Sed non rusticulum nimis libellum Facundo mea Plinio, Thalia, I perfer: "
1410,NOTES.,"where the address to Thalia perhaps explains Herrick's ""do not _thou_ rehearse"". The important lines are:-- "
1411,NOTES.,"Sed ne tempore non tuo disertam Pulses ebria januam, videto. ...       ...       ... Seras tutior ibis ad lucernas. Hæc hora est tua, cum furit Lyæus, Cum regnat rosa, cum madent capilli: Tunc me vel rigidi legant Catones. "
1412,NOTES.,_When laurel spirts i' th' fire._ Burning bay leaves was a Christmas observance. Herrick sings:-- 
1413,NOTES.,"""Of crackling laurel, which foresounds A plenteous harvest to your grounds"": "
1414,NOTES.,where compare Tibull. II. v. 81-84. It was also used by maids as a love omen. 
1415,NOTES.,"_Thyrse ... sacred Orgies._ Herrick's glosses show that the passage he had in mind was Catullus, lxiv. 256-269:-- "
1416,NOTES.,"Harum pars tecta quatiebant cuspide thyrsos ...       ...       ...       ... Pars obscura cavis celebrabant orgia cistis, Orgia, quæ frustra cupiunt audire profani. "
1417,NOTES.,10. _No man at one time can be wise and love._ Amare et sapere vix deo conceditur. (Publius Syrus.) The quotation is found in both Burton and Montaigne. 
1418,NOTES.,"12. _Who fears to ask_, etc. From Seneca, _Hippol._ 594-95. Qui timide rogat ... docet negare. "
1419,NOTES.,"15. _Goddess Isis ... with her scent._ Cp. Plutarch, _De Iside et Osiride_, 15. "
1420,NOTES.,17. _He acts the crime._ Seneca: Nil interest faveas sceleri an illud facias. 
1422,NOTES.,"31. _A Sister ... about I'll lead._ ""Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife?"" 1 Cor. ix. 5. "
1423,NOTES.,35. _Mercy and Truth live with thee._ 2 Sam. xv. 20. 
1424,NOTES.,"38. _To please those babies in your eyes._ The phrase ""babies [_i.e._, dolls] in the eyes"" is probably only a translation of its metaphor, involved in the use of the Latin _pupilla_ (a little girl), or ""pupil,"" for the central spot of the eye. The metaphor doubtless arose from the small reflections of the inlooker, which appear in the eyes of the person gazed at; but we meet with it both intensified, as in the phrase ""to look babies in the eyes"" (= to peer amorously), and with its origin disregarded, as in Herrick, where the ""babies"" are the pupils, and have an existence independent of any inlooker. "
1427,NOTES.,"_Full casks._ So G. Herbert, _Jacula Prudentum_ (1640): Empty vessels sound most. "
1428,NOTES.,"48. _Thus woe succeeds a woe as wave a wave._ Horace, Ep. II. ii. 176: Velut unda supervenit unda. Κύματα κακῶν and κακῶν τρικυμία are common phrases in Greek tragedy. "
1429,NOTES.,"49. _Cherry-pit._ Printed in the 1654 edition of _Witts Recreations_, where it appears as:-- "
1430,NOTES.,"""_Nicholas_ and _Nell_ did lately sit Playing for sport at cherry-pit; They both did throw, and, having thrown, He got the pit and she the stone"". "
1431,NOTES.,51. _Ennobled numbers._ This poem is often quoted to prove that Herrick's country incumbency was good for his verse; but if the reference be only to his sacred poems or _Noble Numbers_ these would rather prove the opposite. 
1432,NOTES.,"52. _O earth, earth, earth, hear thou my voice._ Jerem. xxii. 29: O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord. "
1433,NOTES.,"56. _Love give me more such nights as these._ A reminiscence of Marlowe's version of Ovid, _Amor_. I. v. 26: ""Jove send me more such afternoons as this"". "
1434,NOTES.,"72. _Upon his Sister-in-law, Mistress Elizabeth Herrick_, wife to his brother Thomas (see _infra_, 106). "
1435,NOTES.,"74. _Love makes me write what shame forbids to speak._ Ovid, _Phædra to Hippol._: Dicere quæ puduit scribere jussit amor. "
1436,NOTES.,_Give me a kiss._ Herrick is here imitating the well-known lines of Catullus to Lesbia (_Carm._ v.):-- 
1437,NOTES.,"Da mi basia mille, deinde centum, Dein mille altera, dein secunda centum, Deinde usque altera mille, deinde centum, Dein, cum millia multa fecerimus, Conturbabimus illa, ne sciamus, etc. "
1438,NOTES.,"77. _To the King, upon his coming with his army into the west._ Essex had marched into the west in June, 1644, relieved Lyme, and captured royal fortresses in Dorset and Devon. Charles followed him into ""the drooping west,"" and, in September, the Parliamentary infantry were forced to surrender, while Essex himself escaped by sea. Herrick's ""white omens"" were thus fulfilled. "
1439,NOTES.,"79. _To the King and Queen upon their unhappy distances._ Henrietta Maria escaped abroad with the crown jewels in 1642, returned the next year and rejoined Charles in the west in 1644, whence she escaped again to France. This poem has been supposed to refer to domestic dissensions; but the ""ball of strife"" is surely the Civil War in general, and the reference to the parting of 1644. "
1440,NOTES.,"81. _The Cheat of Cupid._ Herrick is here translating ""Anacreon,"" 31 [3]:-- "

1442,NOTES.,"Some of his phrases, however, prove that he was occasionally more indebted to the Latin version of Stephanus than to the original. "
1443,NOTES.,"82. _That for seven lusters I did never come._ The fall of Herrick's father from a window, fifteen months after the poet's birth, was imputed at the time to suicide; and it has been reasonably conjectured that some mystery may have attached to the place of his burial. If ""seven lusters"" can be taken literally for thirty-five years, this poem was written in 1627. "

1454,NOTES.,"106. _A Country Life: To his brother, M. Tho. Herrick._ ""Thomas, baptized May 12, 1588, was placed by his uncle and guardian, Sir William Heyrick, with Mr. Massam, a merchant in London; but in 1610 he appears to have returned into the country and to have settled in a small farm. It is supposed that this Thomas was the father of Thomas Heyrick, who in 1668 resided at Market Harborough and issued a trader's token there, and grandfather to the Thomas who was curate of Harborough and published some sermons and poems."" Hill's _Market Harborough_, p. 122. "
1455,NOTES.,"A MS. version of this poem is contained in Ashmole 38, from which Dr. Grosart gives a full collation on pp. cli.-cliii. of his Memorial Introduction. The MS. appears to follow an unrevised version of the poem, and contains a few couplets which Herrick afterwards thought fit to omit. The most important passage comes after line 92: ""Virtue had, and mov'd her sphere"". "
1456,NOTES.,"""Nor know thy happy and unenvied state Owes more to virtue than to fate, Or fortune too; for what the first secures, That as herself, or heaven, endures. The two last fail, and by experience make Known, not they give again, they take."" "

1464,NOTES.,"112. _To the Earl of Westmoreland._ Mildmay Fane succeeded his father, Thomas Fane, the first earl, in March, 1628. At the outbreak of the Civil War he sided with the king, but after a short imprisonment made his submission to the Parliament, and was relieved of the sequestration of his estates. He subsequently printed privately a volume of poems, called _Otia Sacra_, which has been re-edited by Dr. Grosart. "
1465,NOTES.,"117. _To the Patron of Poets, M. End. Porter._ Five of Herrick's poems are addressed to Endymion Porter, who seems to have been looked to as a patron by all the singers of his day. According to the inscription on a medal of him executed by Varin in 1635, he was then forty-eight, so that he was born in 1587, coming into the world at Aston-under-Hill in Gloucestershire. He went with Charles on his trip to Spain, and after his accession became groom of his bedchamber, was active in the king's service during the Civil War, and died in 1649. He was a collector of works of art both for himself and for the king, and encouraged Rob. Dover's Cotswold games by presenting him with a suit of the king's clothes. À Wood tells us this, and mentions also that he was a friend of Donne, that Gervase Warmsely dedicated his _Virescit Vulnere Virtus_ to him in 1628, and that in conjunction with the Earl of St. Alban's he also received the dedication of Davenant's _Madagascar_. "
1466,NOTES.,"_Let there be patrons_, etc. Burton, I. ii. 3, § 15. 'Tis an old saying: ""Sint Mæcenates, non deerunt, Flacce, Marones"" (Mart. VIII. lvi. 5). "

1472,NOTES.,"123. _The Tear sent to her from Staines._ This is printed in _Witts Recreations_ with no other variation than in the title, which there runs: ""A Teare sent his Mistresse"". Dr. Grosart notes that Staines was at the time a royal residence. "
1473,NOTES.,"128. _His Farewell to Sack._ A manuscript version of this poem at the British Museum omits many lines (7, 8, 11-22, 29-36), and contains few important variants. ""Of the yet chaste and undefiled bride"" is a poor anticipation of line 6, and ""To raise the holy madness"" for ""To rouse the sacred madness"" is also weak. For the line and a half:-- "
1474,NOTES.,"""Prithee not smile Or smile more inly, lest thy looks beguile,"" "
1476,NOTES.,"""I prithee draw in Thy gazing fires, lest at their sight the sin Of fierce idolatry shoot into me, and I turn apostate to the strict command Of nature; bid me now farewell, or smile More ugly, lest thy tempting looks beguile"". "
1477,NOTES.,"This MS. version is followed in the first published text in _Witts Recreations_, 1645. "
1478,NOTES.,"130. _Upon Mrs. Eliz. Wheeler._ ""The lady complimented in this poem was probably a relation by marriage. Herrick's first cousin, Martha, the seventh daughter of his uncle Robert, married Mr. John Wheeler."" Nott. "
1479,NOTES.,"132. _Fold now thine arms._ A sign of grief. Cp. ""His arms in this sad knot"". _Tempest._ "
1480,NOTES.,"134. _Mr. J. Warr._ This John Warr is probably the same as the ""honoured friend, Mr. John Weare, Councellour,"" of a later poem. Dr. Grosart quotes an ""Epitaph upon his honoured friend, Master Warre,"" by Randolph. Nothing is known of him, but I find in the Oxford Register that a John Warr matriculated at Exeter College, 16th May, 1619, and proceeded M.A. in 1624. He may possibly be Herrick's friend. "
1481,NOTES.,"137. _Dowry with a wife._ Cp. Ovid, _Ars Am._ ii. 155: Dos est uxoria lites. "
1482,NOTES.,"139. _The Wounded Cupid._ This is taken from Anacreon, 33 [40]:-- "
1483,NOTES.,"Ἔρως ποτ' ἐν ῥόδοισιν κοιμωμένην μέλιτταν οὐκ εἶδεν, ἀλλ' ἐτοώθη τὸν δάκτυλον· παταχθείς τὰς χεῖρας ὠλόλυξεν· δραμὼν δὲ καὶ πετασθεις πρὸς τὴν καλὴν Κυθήρην ὄλωλα, μᾶτερ, εἶπεν, ὄλωλα κἀποθνήσκω· ὄφις μ' ἔτυψε μικρός πτερωτός, ὃν καλοῦσιν μέλιτταν οἱ γεωργοί. ἁ δ' εἶπεν· εἰ τὸ κέντρον πονεῖ τὸ τᾶς μελίττας, πόσον δοκεῖς πονοῦσιν, Ἔρως, ὅσους σὺ βάλλεις; "
1484,NOTES.,"142. _A Virgin's face she had._ Herrick is imitating a charming passage from the first Æneid (ll. 315-320), in which Æneas is confronted by Venus:-- "
1485,NOTES.,"Virginis os habitumque gerens et virginis arma, Spartanae vel qualis equos Threissa fatigat Harpalyce volucremque fuga praevertitur Eurum. Namque umeris de more habilem suspenderat arcum Venatrix, dederatque comam diffundere ventis, Nuda genu nodoque sinus collecta fluentis. "
1486,NOTES.,"_With a wand of myrtle_, etc. Cp. Anacreon, 7 [29]:-- "
1487,NOTES.,"Ὑακινθίνῃ με ῥάβδῳ χαλέπως, Ἔρως ῥαπίζων ... εἶπε· Σὺ γὰρ οὐ δύνῃ φιλῆσαι. "
1488,NOTES.,"146. _Upon the Bishop of Lincoln's Imprisonment._ John Williams (1582-1650), Bishop of Lincoln, 1621; Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, 1621-1625; suspended and imprisoned, 1637-1640, on a frivolous charge of having betrayed the king's secrets; Archbishop of York, 1641. Save from this poem and the _Carol_ printed in the Appendix we know nothing of his relations with Herrick. He had probably stood in the way of the poet's obtaining holy orders or preferment. When Herrick was appointed to the cure of Dean Prior in 1629, Williams had already lost favour at the Court. "
1489,NOTES.,"147. _Cynthius pluck ye by the ear._ Cp. Virg. _Ecl._ vi. 3: Cynthius aurem Vellit et admonuit; and Milton's _Lycidas_, 77: ""Phœbus replied and touched my trembling ears"". "
1490,NOTES.,"_The lazy man the most doth love._ Cp. Ovid, _Remed. Amor._ 144: Cedit amor rebus: res age, tutus eris. Nott. But Ovid could also write: Qui nolet fieri desidiosus amet (1 _Am._ ix. 46). "
1491,NOTES.,"149. _Sir Thomas Southwell_, of Hangleton, Sussex, knighted 1615, died before December 16, 1642. "
1492,NOTES.,"_Those tapers five._ Mentioned by Plutarch, _Qu. Rom._ 2. For their significance see Ben Jonson's _Masque of Hymen_. "
1493,NOTES.,"_O'er the threshold force her in._ The custom of lifting the bride over the threshold, probably to avert an ill-omened stumble, has prevailed among the most diverse races. For the anointing of the doorposts Brand quotes Langley's translation of Polydore Vergil: ""The bryde anoynted the poostes of the doores with swynes' grease, because she thought by that meanes to dryve awaye all misfortune, whereof she had her name in Latin 'Uxor ab unguendo'"". "
1494,NOTES.,"_To gather nuts._ A Roman marriage custom mentioned in Catullus, _Carm._ lxi. 124-127, the _In Nuptias Juliæ et Manlii_, which Herrick keeps in mind all through this ode. "

1496,NOTES.,"_But when ye both can say Come._ The wish in this case appears to have been fulfilled, as Lady Southwell administered to her husband's estate, Dec. 16, 1642, and her own estate was administered on the thirtieth of the following January. "

1502,NOTES.,"159. _The Cruel Maid._ Printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, with no other variant than the mistaken omission of ""how"" in l. 7. I do not think that it has been yet pointed out that the whole poem is a close imitation of Theocritus, xxiii. 19-47:-- "
1504,NOTES.,"Possibly Herrick meant to translate the whole poem, which would explain his initial _And_. But cp. Ben Jonson's _Engl. Gram._ ch. viii.: ""'And' in the beginning of a sentence serveth instead of an admiration"". "
1505,NOTES.,"164. _To a Gentlewoman objecting to him his gray hairs._ Mr. Hazlitt quotes an early MS. copy headed: ""An old man to his younge Mrs."". The variants, as he observes, are mostly for the worse. The poem may have been suggested to Herrick by Anacreon, 6 [11]:-- "
1506,NOTES.,"Λέγουσιν αἱ γυναῖκες, Ἀνακρέων, γέρων εἶ· λαβὼν ἔσοπτρον ἄθρει κόμας μὲν οὐκέτ' οὔσας κ.τ.λ. "

1509,NOTES.,"170. _I fear no earthly powers._ Probably suggested by Anacreon [36], beginning: τί με τοὺς νόμους διδάσκεις; Cp. also 7 [15]: Οὔ μοι μέλει τὰ Γύγεω. "
1510,NOTES.,"172. _A Ring presented to Julia._ Printed without variation in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, under the title: ""With a O to Julia"". "
1511,NOTES.,"174. _Still thou reply'st: The Dead._ Cp. Martial, VIII. lxix. 1, 2:-- "
1513,NOTES.,"178. _Corinna's going a-Maying._ Herrick's poem is a charming expansion of Chaucer's theme: ""For May wol have no slogardye a night"". The account of May-day customs in Brand (vol. i. pp. 212-234) is unusually full, and all Herrick's allusions can be illustrated from it. Dr. Nott compares the last stanza to Catullus, _Carm._ v.; but parallels from the classic poets could be multiplied indefinitely. "
1514,NOTES.,_The God unshorn_ of l. 2 is from Hor. I. _Od_. xxi. 2: Intonsum pueri dicite Cynthium. 
1515,NOTES.,181. _A dialogue between Horace and Lydia._ Hor. III. _Od._ ix. 
1516,NOTES.,"_Ramsey._ Organist of Trinity College, Cambridge, 1628-1634. Some of his music still exists in MS. "
1517,NOTES.,"185. _An Ode to Master Endymion Porter, upon his brother's death._ Endymion Porter is said to have had an only brother, Giles, who died in the king's service at Oxford, _i.e._, between 1642 and 1646, and it has been taken for granted that this ode refers to his death. The supposition is possibly right, but if so, the ode, despite its beauty, is so gratingly and extraordinarily selfish that we may wonder if the dead brother is not the William Herrick of the next poem. The first verse is, of course, a soliloquy of Herrick's, not, as Dr. Grosart suggests, addressed to him by Porter. Dr. Nott again parallels Catullus, _Carm_. v. "
1518,NOTES.,"186. _To his dying brother, Master William Herrick._ According to Dr. Grosart and Mr. Hazlitt the poet had an elder brother, William, baptized at St. Vedast's, Foster Lane, Nov. 24, 1585 (he must have been born some months earlier, if this date be right, for his sister Martha was baptized in the following January), and alive in 1629, when he acted as one of the executors of his mother's will. But, it is said, there was also another brother named William, born in 1593, after his father's death, ""at Harry Campion's house at Hampton"". I have not been able to find the authority for this last statement, which, as it asserts the co-existence of two brothers, of the same name, is certainly surprising. According to Dr. Grosart, it is the younger William who ""died young"" and was addressed in this poem, but I must own to feeling some doubt in the matter. "
1519,NOTES.,"193. _The Lily in a Crystal._ The poem may be taken as an expansion of Martial, VIII. lxviii. 5-8:-- "
1520,NOTES.,"Condita perspicuâ vivit vindemia gemmâ Et tegitur felix, nec tamen uva latet: Femineum lucet sic per bombycina corpus, Calculus in nitidâ sic numeratur aquâ. "
1521,NOTES.,"197. _The Welcome to Sack._ Two MSS. at the British Museum (Harl. 6931 and Add. 19,268) contain copies of this important poem. These copies differ considerably from the printed version, are proved by small variations to be independent of each other, and at the same time agree in all important points. We may conclude, therefore, that they represent an earlier version of the poem, subsequently revised by Herrick before the issue of _Hesperides_. In the subjoined copy, in which the two MSS. are corrected from each other, italics show the variations, asterisks mark lines omitted in _Hesperides_, and a dagger the absence of lines subsequently added. "
1522,NOTES.,"""So _swift_ streams meet, so springs with gladder smiles Meet after long divorcement _made by_ isles: When love (the child of likeness) urgeth on Their crystal _waters_ to an union. So meet stol'n kisses when the moonie _night_ Calls forth fierce lovers to their wisht _delight_: So kings and queens meet, when desire convinces All thoughts, _save those that tend to_ getting princes. As I meet thee, Soul of my life and fame! Eternal Lamp of Love, whose radiant flame Out-_darts_ the heaven's Osiris; and thy _gems Darken_ the splendour of his mid-day beams. Welcome, O welcome, my illustrious spouse! Welcome as are the ends unto my vows: _Nay_, far more welcome than the happy soil The sea-scourged merchant, after all his toil, Salutes with tears of joy, when fires _display_ The _smoking_ chimneys of his Ithaca. Where hast thou been so long from my embraces, Poor pitied exile? Tell me, did thy Graces Fly discontented hence, and for a time _Choose rather for_ to bless _some_ other clime? †*_Oh, then, not longer let my sweet defer *Her buxom smiles from me, her worshipper!_ Why _have those amber_ looks, the which have been Time-past so fragrant, sickly now _call'd_ in Like a dull twilight? Tell me, *_hath my soul *Prophaned in speech or done an act that is foul *Against thy purer essence?_ _For that_ fault I'll expiate with sulphur, hair and salt: And with the crystal humour of the spring Purge hence the guilt, and kill _the_ quarrelling. _Wilt_ thou not smile, _nor_ tell me what's amiss? Have I been cold to hug thee, too remiss, Too temperate in embracing? Tell me, has desire To-thee-ward died in the embers, and no fire Left in _the_ raked-up _ashes_, as a mark To testify the glowing of a spark? †_I must_ confess I left thee, and appeal 'Twas done by me more to _increase_ my zeal, And double my affection[†]; as do those Whose love grows more inflamed by being _froze_. But to forsake thee, [†] could there _ever_ be A thought of such-like possibility? When _all the world may know that vines_ shall lack Grapes, before Herrick _leave_ Canary sack. *_Sack is my life, my leaven, salt to all *My dearest dainties, nay, 'tis the principal *Fire unto all my functions, gives me blood, *An active spirit, full marrow, and, what is good,_ _Sack makes_ me _sprightful, airy_ to be borne, Like Iphyclus, upon the tops of corn. _Sack makes_ me nimble, as the wingèd hours, To dance and caper _o'er the tops_ of flowers, And ride the sunbeams. Can there be a thing Under the _cope of heaven_ that can bring More _joy_ unto my _soul_, or can present My Genius with a fuller blandishment? Illustrious Idol! _Can_ the Egyptians seek Help from the garlick, onion and the leek, And pay no vows to thee, who _art the_ best God, and far more _transcending_ than the rest? Had Cassius, that weak water-drinker, known Thee in _the_ Vine, or had but tasted one Small chalice of thy _nectar, he, even_ he As the wise Cato had approved of thee. Had not Jove's son, the _rash_ Tyrinthian swain (Invited to the Thesbian banquet), ta'ne Full goblets of thy [†] blood; his *_lustful_ sprite _Had not_ kept heat for fifty maids that night. †As Queens meet Queens, _so let sack come to_ me _Or_ as Cleopatra _unto_ Anthonie, When her high _visage_ did at once present To the Triumvir love and wonderment. Swell up my _feeble sinews_, let my blood †Fill each part full of fire,* _let all my good_ _Parts be encouraged_, active to do What thy commanding soul shall put _me_ to, And till I turn apostate to thy love, Which here I vow to serve, _never_ remove Thy _blessing_ from me; but Apollo's curse Blast _all mine_ actions; or, a thing that's worse, When these circumstants _have the fate_ to see The time _when_ I prevaricate from thee, Call me the Son of Beer, and then confine Me to the tap, the toast, the turf; let wine Ne'er shine upon me; _let_ my _verses_ all _Haste_ to a sudden death and funeral: And last, _dear Spouse, when I thee_ disavow, _May ne'er_ prophetic Daphne crown my brow."" "
1523,NOTES.,"Certainly this manuscript version is in every way inferior to that printed in the _Hesperides_, and Herrick must be reckoned among the poets who are able to revise their own work. "

(_Stella Meridiana_, 1661.) "

1547,NOTES.,"Clarendon (_History of the Rebellion_, ix. 19) thus records his death and character: ""Here fell many gentlemen and officers of name, with the brave Earl of Litchfield, who was the third brother of that illustrious family that sacrificed his life in this quarrel. He was a very faultless young man, of a most gentle, courteous, and affable nature, and of a spirit and courage invincible; whose loss all men lamented, and the king bore it with extraordinary grief."" "
1548,NOTES.,"_Trentall._ Properly a set of thirty masses for the repose of a dead man's soul. Here and elsewhere Herrick uses the word as an equivalent for dirge, but Sidney distinguished them: ""Let dirige be sung and trentalls rightly read. For love is dead,"" etc. ""Hence, hence profane,"" is the Latin, _procul o procul este profani_ of Virg. _Æn._ vi. 258, where ""profane"" is only equivalent to uninitiated. "
1549,NOTES.,"223. _The Fairy Temple._ For a brief note on Herrick's fairy poems, see Appendix. On the dedication to Mr. John Merrifield, Counsellor-at-Law, Dr. Grosart remarks: ""Nothing seems to be now known of Merrifield. It is just possible that--as throughout the poem--the name was an invented one, 'Merry Field'."" But the records of the Inner Temple show that the Merrifields were a legal family from Woolmiston, near Crewkerne, Somersetshire. John (son of Richard) Merrifield, the father, was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1581, and John, the son, in 1611. This latter must be Herrick's Counsellor. He rose to be a Master of the Bench in 1638 and Sergeant-at-Law in 1660. He died October, 1666, aged 75, at Crewkerne. On the other hand, it can hardly be doubted that Dr. Grosart is right in regarding the names of the fairy saints as quite imaginary. He nevertheless suggests SS. Titus, Neot, Idus, Ida, Fridian or Fridolin, Trypho, Felan and Felix as the possible prototypes of ""Saint _Tit_, Saint _Nit_, Saint _Is_,"" etc. It should be noted that ""Tit and Nit"" occur with ""Wap and Win"" and other obviously made-up names, in Drayton's _Nymphidia_.

MS. 6917, and Add. 25, 303). Seven verses are transcribed in these manuscripts which Herrick afterwards saw fit to omit, and almost every verse contains variants of importance. It is impossible to convey the effect of the earlier version by a mere collation, and I therefore transcribe it in full, despite its length. As before, variants and additions are printed in italics. The numbers in brackets are those of the later version, as given in _Hesperides_. The marginal readings are variants of Add. 25, 303, from the Harleian manuscript. "

"
1622,--R. HERRICK.,"The variants in this version are not very important; one of the most noteworthy, _round_ for _ground_, in stanza 5 [4], was overlooked by Dr. Grosart in his collation. Of the seven stanzas subsequently omitted several are of great beauty. There are few happier images in Herrick than that of _Time throned in a saffron evening_ in stanza 11. It is only when the earlier version is read as a whole that Herrick's taste in omitting is vindicated. Each stanza is good in itself, but in the MSS. the poem drags from excessive length, and the reduction of its twenty-three stanzas to sixteen greatly improves it. "

Add. MS. 22, 603, at the British Museum, and Ashmole MS. 38, at the Bodleian, contain early versions of the poem substantially agreeing. I transcribe the Museum copy:-- "
1629,--R. HERRICK.,"""A little mushroom table spread After _the dance_, they set on bread, A _yellow corn of hecky_ wheat With some small _sandy_ grit to eat His choice bits; with _which_ in a trice They make a feast less great than nice. But all _the_ while his eye _was_ served We _dare_ not think his ear was sterved: But that there was in place to stir His _fire_ the _pittering_ Grasshopper; The merry Cricket, puling Fly, The piping Gnat for minstralcy. _The Humming Dor, the dying Swan, And each a choice Musician._ And now we must imagine first, The Elves present to quench his thirst A pure seed-pearl of infant dew, Brought and _beswetted_ in a blue And pregnant violet; which done, His kitling eyes begin to run Quite through the table, where he spies The horns of papery Butterflies: Of which he eats, _but with_ a little _Neat cool allay_ of Cuckoo's spittle; A little Fuz-ball pudding stands By, yet not blessed by his hands-- That was too coarse, but _he not spares To feed upon the candid hairs Of a dried canker, with a_ sagg And well _bestuffed_ Bee's sweet bag: _Stroking_ his pallet with some store Of Emme_t_ eggs. What would he more, But Beards of Mice, _an Ewt's_ stew'd thigh, _A pickled maggot and a dry Hipp, with a_ Red cap worm, that's shut Within the concave of a Nut Brown as his tooth, _and with the fat And well-boiled inchpin of a Bat. A bloated Earwig with the Pith Of sugared rush aglads him with; But most of all the Glow-worm's fire. As most betickling his desire To know his Queen, mixt with the far- Fetcht binding-jelly of a star. The silk-worm's seed_, a little moth _Lately_ fattened in a piece of cloth; Withered cherries; Mandrake's ears; Mole's eyes; to these the slain stag's tears; The unctuous dewlaps of a Snail; The broke heart of a Nightingale O'er-come in music; with a wine Ne'er ravished from the flattering Vine, But gently pressed from the soft side Of the most sweet and dainty Bride, Brought in a _daisy chalice_, which He fully quaffs _off_ to bewitch His blood _too high_. This done, commended Grace by his Priest, the feast is ended."" "
1630,--R. HERRICK.,"The Shapcott to whom this _Oberon's Feast_ and _Oberon's Palace_ are dedicated is Herrick's ""peculiar friend, Master Thomas Shapcott, Lawyer,"" of a later poem. Dr. Grosart again suggests that it may have been a character-name, but, as in the case of John Merrifield, the owner was a West country-man and a member of the Inner Temple, where he was admitted in 1632 as the ""son and heir of Thomas Shapcott,"" of Exeter. "

1633,--R. HERRICK.,"301. _Master Edward Norgate, Clerk of the Signet of his Majesty:_-- "
1634,--R. HERRICK.,"Son to Robert Norgate, D.D., Master of Bene't College, Cambridge. He was employed by the Earl of Arundel to purchase pictures, and on one occasion found himself at Marseilles without remittances, and had to tramp through France on foot. According to the Calendars of State Papers in 1625, it was ordered that, ""forasmuch as his Majesty's letters to the Grand Signior, the King of Persia, the Emperor of Russia, the Great Mogul, and other remote Princes, had been written, limned, and garnished with gold and colours by scriveners abroad, thenceforth they should be so written, limned, and garnished by Edward Norgate, Clerk of the Signet in reversion"". Six years later this order was renewed, the ""Kings of Bantam, Macassar, Barbary, Siam, Achine, Fez, and Sus"" being added to the previous list, and Norgate being now designated as a Clerk of the Signet Extraordinary. In the same year, having previously been Bluemantle Pursuivant, he was promoted to be Windsor Herald, in which capacity he received numerous fees during the next few years, and was excused ship money. He still, however, retained his clerkship, for he writes in 1639: ""The poor Office of Arms is fain to blazon the Council books and Signet"". The phrase occurs in a series of nineteen letters of extraordinary interest, which Norgate wrote from the North, chiefly to his friend, Robert Reade, secretary to Windebank, on the course of affairs. In Sept., 1641, ""Ned Norgate"" was ordered personally to attend the king. ""It is his Majesty's pleasure that the master should wait and not the men, and _that_ they shall find."" Henceforth I find no certain reference to him; according to Fuller he died at the Herald's Office in 1649. It would be interesting if we could be sure that this Edward Norgate is the same as the one who in 1611 was appointed Tuner of his Majesty's ""virginals, organs, and other instruments,"" and in 1637 received a grant of £140 for the repair of the organ at Hampton Court. Herrick's love of music makes us expect to find a similar trait in his friends. "
1635,--R. HERRICK.,"313. _The Entertainment, or Porch Verse._ The words _Ye wrong the threshold-god_ and the allusion to the porch in the Clipsby Crew Epithalamium (stanza 4) show that there is no reference here (as Brand thinks, ii. 135) to the old custom of reading part of the marriage service at the church door or porch (cp. Chaucer: ""Husbands at churchë door she had had five""). The porch of the house is meant, and the allusions are to the ceremonies at the threshold (cp. the Southwell Epithalamium). Dr. Grosart quotes from the Dean Prior register the entry of the marriage of Henry Northleigh, gentleman, and Mistress Lettice Yard on September 5, 1639, by licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury. "
1636,--R. HERRICK.,"319. _No noise of late-spawned Tittyries._ In the Camden Society's edition of the _Diary of Walter Yonge_, p. 70 (kindly shown me by the Rev. J. H. Ward), we have a contemporary account of the Club known as the Tityre Tues, which took its name from the first words of Virgil's first _Eclogue_. ""The beginning of December, 1623, there was a great number in London, haunting taverns and other debauched places, who swore themselves in a brotherhood and named themselves _Tityre Tues_. The oath they gave in this manner: he that was to be sworn did put his dagger into a pottle of wine, and held his hand upon the pommel thereof, and then was to make oath that he would aid and assist all other of his fellowship and not disclose their council. There were divers knights, some young noblemen and gentlemen of this brotherhood, and they were to know one the other by a black bugle which they wore, and their followers to be known by a blue ribbond. There are discovered of them about 80 or 100 persons, and have been examined by the Privy Council, but nothing discovered of any intent they had. It is said that the king hath given commandment that they shall be re-examined."" In Mennis's _Musarum Deliciæ_ the brotherhood is celebrated in a poem headed ""The Tytre Tues; or, a Mocke Song. To the tune of Chive Chase. By Mr. George Chambers."" The second verse runs:-- "
1637,--R. HERRICK.,"""They call themselves the Tytere-tues, And wore a blue rib-bin; And when a-drie would not refuse To drink. O fearful sin! "
1638,--R. HERRICK.,"""The council, which is thought most wise, Did sit so long upon it, That they grew weary and did rise, And could make nothing on it."" "
1639,--R. HERRICK.,"According to a letter of Chamberlain to Carleton, indexed among the _State Papers_, the Tityres were a secret society first formed in Lord Vaux's regiment in the Low Countries, and their ""prince"" was called Ottoman. Another entry shows that the ""Bugle"" mentioned by Yonge was the badge of a society originally distinct from the Tityres, which afterwards joined with it. The date of Herrick's poem is thus fixed as December, 1623/4, and this is confirmed by another sentence in the same passage in _Yonge's Diary_, in which he says: ""The Jesuits and Papists do wonderfully swarm in the city, and rumours lately have been given out for firing the Navy and House of Munition, on which are set a double guard"". The Parliament to which Herrick alludes was actually summoned in January, 1624, to meet on February 12. Sir Simeon Steward, to whom the poem is addressed, was of the family of the Stewards of Stantney, in the Isle of Ely. He was knighted with his father, Mark Steward, in 1603, and afterwards became a fellow-commoner of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was at different times Sheriff and Deputy-Lieutenant for Cambridgeshire, and while serving in the latter capacity got into some trouble for unlawful exactions. In 1627 he wrote a poem on the _King of the Fairies Clothes_ in the same vein as Herrick's fairy pieces. "
1640,--R. HERRICK.,"321. _Then is the work half done._ As Dr. Grosart suggests, Herrick may have had in mind the ""Dimidium facti qui cœpit habet"" of Horace, I. _Epist._ ii. 40. But here the emphasis is on beginning _well_, there on _beginning_. "
1641,--R. HERRICK.,"_Begin with Jove_ is doubtless from the ""Ab Jove principium, Musæ,"" of Virg. _Ecl._ iii. 60. "
1642,--R. HERRICK.,"323. _Fears not the fierce sedition of the seas._ A reminiscence of Horace, III. _Od._ i. 25-32. "
1643,--R. HERRICK.,"328. _Gold before goodness._ Printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, as _A Foolish Querie_. The sentiment is from Seneca, _Ep._ cxv.: An dives, omnes quærimus; nemo, an bonus. Cp. Juvenal, III. 140 sqq.; Plaut. _Menæchm._ IV. ii. 6. "
1644,--R. HERRICK.,"331. _To his honoured kinsman, Sir William Soame._ The second son of Sir Stephen Soame, Lord Mayor of London in 1598. Herrick's father and Sir Stephen married sisters. "
1645,--R. HERRICK.,"_As benjamin and storax when they meet._ Instances of the use of ""Benjamin"" for gum benzoin will be found in the Dictionaries. Dr. Grosart's gloss, ""_Benjamin_, the favourite youngest son of the Patriarch,"" is unfortunate. "
1646,--R. HERRICK.,"336. _His Age: dedicated to ... M. John Wickes under the name of Posthumus._ There is an important version of this poem in Egerton MS., 2725, where it is entitled _Mr. Herrick's Old Age to Mr. Weekes_. I do not think it has been collated before. Stanzas i.-vi. contain few variants; ii. 6 reads: ""Dislikes to care for what's behind""; iii. 6: ""Like a lost maidenhead,"" for ""Like to a lily lost""; v. 8: ""With the best and whitest stone""; vi. 1: ""We'll not be poor"". After this we have two stanzas omitted in 1648:-- "
1647,--R. HERRICK.,"""We have no vineyards which do bear Their lustful clusters all the year, Nor odoriferous Orchards, like to Alcinous; Nor gall the seas Our witty appetites to please With mullet, turbot, gilt-head bought At a high rate and further brought. "
1648,--R. HERRICK.,"""Nor can we glory of a great And stuffed magazine of wheat; We have no bath Of oil, but only rich in faith O'er which the hand Of fortune can have no command, But what she gives not, she not takes, But of her own a spoil she makes."" "
1649,--R. HERRICK.,"Stanza vii., l. 2, has ""close"" for ""both""; l. 3 ""see"" for ""have""; l. 6, ""open"" for ""that cheap""; l. 7, ""full"" for ""same"". Stanzas x.-xvii. have so many variants that I am obliged to transcribe them in full, though they show Herrick not at his best, and the poem is not one to linger over:-- "
1651,--R. HERRICK.,"""Live in thy peace; as for myself, When I am bruisèd on the shelf Of Time, and _read Eternal daylight o'er my head:_ When with the rheum, _With_ cough _and_ ptisick, I consume _Into an heap of cinders:_ then The Ages fled I'll call again, "
1653,--R. HERRICK.,"""And with a tear compare these last _And cold times unto_ those are past, While Baucis by _With her lean lips_ shall kiss _them dry Then will we_ sit By the fire, foretelling snow and sleet And weather by our aches, grown †Old enough to be our own "
1655,--R. HERRICK.,"""True Calendar      [              ] _Is for to know_ what change is near, Then to assuage The gripings _in_ the chine by age, I'll call my young Iülus to sing such a song I made upon my _mistress'_ breast; _Or such a_ blush at such a feast. "
1657,--R. HERRICK.,"""Then shall he read _my Lily fine Entomb'd_ within a crystal shrine: _My_ Primrose next: A piece then of a higher text; For to beget In me a more transcendent heat Than that insinuating fire Which crept into each _reverend_ Sire, "
1659,--R. HERRICK.,"""When the _high_ Helen _her fair cheeks Showed to the army of the Greeks;_ At which I'll _rise_ (_Blind though as midnight in my eyes_), And hearing it, Flutter and crow, _and_, in a fit Of _young_ concupiscence, and _feel New flames within the aged steal_. "
1661,--R. HERRICK.,"""Thus frantic, crazy man (God wot), I'll call to mind _the times_ forgot And oft between _Sigh out_ the Times that _we_ have seen! _And shed a tear_, And twisting my Iülus _hair_, Doting, I'll weep and say (in truth) Baucis, these were _the_ sins of youth. "
1663,--R. HERRICK.,"""Then _will I_ cause my hopeful Lad (If a wild Apple can be had) To crown the Hearth (Lar thus conspiring with our mirth); _Next_ to infuse Our _better beer_ into the cruse: Which, neatly spiced, we'll first carouse Unto the _Vesta_ of the house. "
1665,--R. HERRICK.,"""Then the next health to friends of mine _In oysters, and_ Burgundian wine, _Hind, Goderiske, Smith, And Nansagge_, sons of _clune[M] and_ pith, Such _who know_ well _To board_ the magic _bowl_, and _spill All mighty blood, and can do more Than Jove and Chaos them before_."" "
1667,--R. HERRICK.,"This John Wickes or Weekes is spoken of by Anthony à Wood as a ""jocular person"" and a popular preacher. He enters Wood's _Fasti_ by right of his co-optation as a D.D. in 1643, while the court was at Oxford; his education had been at Cambridge. He was a prebendary of Bristol and Dean of St. Burian in Cornwall, and suffered some persecution as a royalist. Herrick later on, when himself shedless and cottageless, addresses another poem to him as his ""peculiar friend,"" "
1668,--R. HERRICK.,"To whose glad threshold and free door I may, a poet, come, though poor. "
1669,--R. HERRICK.,"A friend suggests that Hind may have been John Hind, an Anacreontic poet and friend of Greene, and has found references to a Thomas Goodricke of St. John's Coll., Camb., author of two poems on the accession of James I., and a Martin Nansogge, B.A. of Trinity Hall, 1614, afterwards vicar of Cornwood, Devon. Smith is certainly James Smith, who, with Sir John Mennis, edited the _Musarum Deliciæ_, in which the first poem is addressed ""to Parson Weekes: an invitation to London,"" and contains a reference to-- "
1670,--R. HERRICK.,"""That old sack Young Herrick took to entertain The Muses in a sprightly vein"". "
1671,--R. HERRICK.,"The early part of this poem contains, along with the name Posthumus, many Horatian reminiscences: cp. especially II. _Od._ xiv. 1-8, and IV. _Od._ vii. 14. It may be noted that in the imitation of the latter passage in stanza iv. the MS. copy at the Museum corrects the misplacement of the epithet, reading:-- "
1672,--R. HERRICK.,"""But we must on and thither tend Where Tullus and rich Ancus blend,"" etc., "
1674,--R. HERRICK.,"Again the variant, ""_Open_ candle baudery,"" in verse 7, is an additional argument against Dr. Grosart's explanation: ""Obscene words and figures made with candle-smoke,"" the allusion being merely to the blackened ceilings produced by cheap candles without a shade. "
1675,--R. HERRICK.,"337. _A Short Hymn to Venus._ Printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, as _A vow to Cupid_, with variants: l. 1, _Cupid_ for _Goddess_; l. 2, _like_ for _with_; l. 3, _that I may_ for _I may but_; l. 5, _do_ for _will_. "
1676,--R. HERRICK.,"340. _Upon a delaying lady._ Printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, as _A Check to her delay_. "
1677,--R. HERRICK.,"341. _The Lady Mary Villars_, niece of the first Duke of Buckingham, married successively Charles, son of Philip, Earl of Pembroke, Esme Stuart, Duke of Richmond and Lennox, and Thomas Howard. Died 1685. "
1678,--R. HERRICK.,"355. _Hath filed upon my silver hairs._ Cp. Ben Jonson, _The King's Entertainment_:-- "
1679,--R. HERRICK.,"""What all the minutes, hours, weeks, months, and years That hang in file upon these silver hairs Could not produce,"" etc. "
1680,--R. HERRICK.,"359. _Philip, Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery._ Philip Herbert (born 1584, died 1650), despite his foul mouth, ill temper, and devotion to sport (""He would make an excellent chancellor to the mews were Oxford turned into a kennel of hounds,"" wrote the author of _Mercurius Menippeus_ when Pembroke succeeded Laud as chancellor), was also a patron of literature. He was one of the ""incomparable pair of brethren"" to whom the Shakespeare folio of 1623 was dedicated, and he was a good friend to Massinger. His fondness for scribbling in the margins of books may, or may not, be considered as further evidence of a respect for literature. "
1681,--R. HERRICK.,"366. _Thou shall not all die._ Horace's ""non omnis moriar"". "
1682,--R. HERRICK.,"367. _Upon Wrinkles._ Printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, under the title _To a Stale Lady_. The first line there reads:-- "
1684,--R. HERRICK.,"375. _Anne Soame, now Lady Abdie_, eldest daughter of Sir Thomas Soame, and second wife of Sir Thomas Abdy, Bart., of Felix Hall, Essex. Herrick's poem is modelled on Mart. III. lxv. "
1685,--R. HERRICK.,"376. _Upon his Kinswoman, Mistress Elizabeth Herrick_, daughter of the poet's brother Nicholas. "
1686,--R. HERRICK.,"377. _A Panegyric to Sir Lewis Pemberton_ of Rushden, in Northamptonshire, sheriff of the county in 1622; married Alice, daughter of Tho. Bowles. Died 1641. With this poem cp. Ben Jonson's _Epig._ ci. "
1687,--R. HERRICK.,"_But great and large she spreads by dust and sweat._ Dr. Grosart very appositely quotes Montaigne: ""For it seemeth that the verie name of vertue presupposeth difficultie and inferreth resistance, and cannot well exercise it selfe without an enemie"" (Florio's tr., p. 233). But I think the two passages have a common origin in some version of Hesiod's τῆς ἀρετῆς ἱδρῶτα θεοὶ προπάροιθεν ἔθηκαν, which is twice quoted by Plato. "
1688,--R. HERRICK.,"382. _After the rare arch-poet, Jonson, died._ Perhaps suggested by the Epitaph of Plautus on himself, _ap._ Gell. i. 24:-- "
1689,--R. HERRICK.,"Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, comoedia luget; Scena deserta, dein risus, ludu' jocusque, Et numeri innumeri simul omnes collacrumarunt. "
1690,--R. HERRICK.,"384. _To his nephew, to be prosperous in painting._ This artistic nephew may have been a Wingfield, son of Mercy Herrick, who married John Wingfield, of Brantham, Suffolk; or one of three sons of Nicholas Herrick and Susanna Salter, or Thomas, or some unknown son of Thomas Herrick. There is no record of any painter Herrick's achievements. "
1691,--R. HERRICK.,"392. _Sir Edward Fish, Knight Baronet_, of Chertsey, in Surrey. Died 1658. "
1692,--R. HERRICK.,"405. _Nor fear or spice or fish._ Herrick is remembering Persius, i. 43: Nec scombros metuentia carmina, nec thus. To form the paper jacket or _tunica_ which wrapt the mackerel in Roman cookery seems to have been the ultimate employment of many poems. Cp. Mart. III. l. 9; IV. lxxxvii. 8; and Catullus, XCV. 8. "
1693,--R. HERRICK.,"_The farting Tanner and familiar King._ The ballad here alluded to is that of _King Edward IV. and the tanner of Tamworth_, printed in Prof. Child's collection. ""The dancing friar tattered in the bush"" of the next line is one of the heroes of the old ballad of _The Fryar and the Boye_, printed by Wynkyn de Worde, and included in the Appendix to Furnivall and Hales' edition of the Percy folio. The boy was the possessor of a ""magic flute,"" and, having got the friar into a bush, made him dance there. "
1694,--R. HERRICK.,"""Jack, as he piped, laughed among, The Friar with briars was vilely stung, He hopped wondrous high. At last the Friar held up his hand And said: I can no longer stand, Oh! I shall dancing die."" "
1695,--R. HERRICK.,"""Those monstrous lies of little Robin Rush"" is explained by Dr. Grosart as an allusion to ""The Historie of Friar Rush, how he came to a House of Religion to seek a Service, and being entertained by the Prior was made First Cook, being full of pleasant Mirth and Delight for young people"". Of ""Tom Chipperfield and pretty lisping Ned"" I can find nothing. ""The flying Pilchard and the frisking Dace"" probably belong to the fish monsters alluded to in the _Tempest_. In ""Tim Trundell"" Herrick seems for the sake of alliteration to have taken a liberty with the Christian name of a well-known ballad publisher. "
1697,--R. HERRICK.,Vitæ est avidus quisquis non vult Mundo secum pereunte mori. 
1698,--R. HERRICK.,"407. _Upon Himself._ 408. _Another._ Both printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, the second under the title of _Love and Liberty_. This last is taken from Corn. Gall. _Eleg._ i. 6, quoted by Montaigne, iii. 5:-- "
1700,--R. HERRICK.,"412. _The Mad Maid's Song._ A manuscript version of this song is contained in Harleian MS. 6917, fol. 48, ver. 80. The chief variants are: st. i. l. 2, _morrow_ for _morning_; l. 4, _all dabbled_ for _bedabbled_; st. ii. l. 1, _cowslip_ for _primrose_; l. 3, _tears_ for _flowers_; l. 4, _was_ for _is_; st. v. l. 1, _hope_ for _know_; st. vii. l. 2, _balsam_ for _cowslips_. "
1701,--R. HERRICK.,"415. _Whither dost thou whorry me._ Quo me, Bacche, rapis tui Plenum? Hor. III. _Od._ xxv. 1. "
1702,--R. HERRICK.,"430. _As Sallust saith_, _i.e._, the pseudo-Sallust in the _Epist. ad Cai. Cæs. de Repub. Ordinanda_. "
1703,--R. HERRICK.,"431. _Every time seems short._ Epigr. in Farnabii, _Florileg._ [a. 1629]:-- "
1704,--R. HERRICK.,"Τοῖσι μὲν εὖ πράττουσιν ἅπας ὁ βίος βραχύς ἐστιν· Τοῖς δὲ κακῶς, μία νὺξ ἄπλετός ἐστι χρόνος. "
1705,--R. HERRICK.,"443. _Oberon's Palace.--After the feast (my Shapcott) see._ See 223, 293, from which it is a pity that this poem should have been divorced. Of the _Palace_ there are as many as three MS. versions, viz., Add. 22, 603 (p. 59), and Add. 25, 303 (p. 157), at the British Museum, both of which I have collated, and Ashmole MS. 38, which I only know through my predecessors. The three MSS. appear to agree very harmoniously, and they unite in increasing our knowledge of Herrick by a passage of twenty-seven lines, following on the words ""And here and there and farther off,"" and in lieu of the next four and a half lines in _Hesperides_. They read as follows:-- "
1706,--R. HERRICK.,"""Some sort of pear, Apple or plum, is neatly laid (As if it was a tribute paid) By the round urchin; some mixt wheat The which the ant did taste, not eat; Deaf nuts, soft Jews'-ears, and some thin Chippings, the mice filched from the bin Of the gray farmer, and to these The scraps of lentils, chitted peas, Dried honeycombs, brown acorn cups, Out of the which he sometimes sups His herby broth, and there close by Are pucker'd bullace, cankers (?), dry Kernels, and withered haws; the rest Are trinkets fal'n from the kite's nest, As butter'd bread, the which the wild Bird snatched away from the crying child, Blue pins, tags, fesenes, beads and things Of higher price, as half-jet rings, Ribbons and then some silken shreaks The virgins lost at barley-breaks. Many a purse-string, many a thread Of gold and silver therein spread, _Many a counter, many a die, Half rotten and without an eye, Lies here about_, and, as we guess, Some bits of thimbles seem to dress The brave cheap work; _and for to pave The excellency of this cave, Squirrels and children's teeth late shed_, Serve here, both which _enchequered_ With castors' doucets, which poor they Bite off themselves to 'scape away: Brown _toadstones_, ferrets' eyes, _the gum That shines_,"" etc. "
1707,--R. HERRICK.,"The italicised words in the last few lines appear in _Hesperides_; all the rest are new. Other variants are: ""The grass of Lemster ore soberly sparkling"" for ""the finest Lemster ore mildly disparkling""; ""girdle"" for ""ceston""; ""The eyes of all doth strait bewitch"" for ""All with temptation doth bewitch""; ""choicely hung"" for ""neatly hung""; ""silver roach"" for ""silvery fish""; ""cave"" for ""room""; ""get reflection"" for ""make reflected""; ""Candlemas"" for ""taper-light""; ""moon-tane"" for ""moon-tanned,"" etc., etc. "
1708,--R. HERRICK.,"_Kings though they're hated._ The ""Oderint dum metuant"" of the _Atreus_ of Accius, quoted by Cicero and Seneca. "
1709,--R. HERRICK.,"446. _To Oenone._ Printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, under the title: ""The Farewell to Love and to his Mistress,"" and with the unlucky misprint ""court"" for ""covet"" (also ""for"" for ""but"") in the stanza iii. l. i. "
1710,--R. HERRICK.,447. _Grief breaks the stoutest heart._ Frangit fortia corda dolor. Tibull. III. ii. 6. 
1711,--R. HERRICK.,"451. _To the right gracious Prince, Lodowick, Duke of Richmond and Lennox._ There appears to me to be a blunder here which Dr. Grosart and Mr. Hazlitt do not elucidate, by recording the birth of Lodowick, first Duke of Richmond, in 1574, his succession to the Lennox title in 1583, creation as Duke of Richmond in May, 1623, and death in the following February. For this first duke was no ""stem"" left ""of all those three brave brothers fallen in the war,"" and the allusion here is undoubtedly to his nephews--George, Lord d'Aubigny, who fell at Edgehill; Lord John Stewart, who fell at Alresford; and Lord Bernard Stewart (Earl of Lichfield), who fell at Rowton Heath. In elucidation of Herrick's Dirge (219) over the last of these three brothers, I have already quoted Clarendon's remark, that he was ""the third brother of that illustrious family that sacrificed his life in this quarrel,"" and it cannot be doubted that Herrick is here alluding to the same fact. The poem must therefore have been written after 1645, _i.e._, more than twenty years after the death of Duke Lodowick. But the duke then living was James, who succeeded his father Esme in 1624, was recreated Duke of Richmond in 1641, and did not die till 1655. It is true that there was a brother named Lodovic, but he was an abbot in France and never succeeded to the title. Herrick, therefore, seems to have blundered in the Christian name. "
1712,--R. HERRICK.,"453. _Let's live in haste._ From Martial, VII. xlvii. 11, 12:-- "
1713,--R. HERRICK.,Vive velut rapto: fugitivaque gaudia carpe: Perdiderit nullum vita reversa diem. 
1715,--R. HERRICK.,"Dum Fata sinunt, Vivite laeti: properat cursu Vita citato, volucrique die Rota praecipitis vertitur anni. "
1718,--R. HERRICK.,"465. _The parting Verse or charge to his Supposed Wife when he travelled._ MS. variants of this poem are found at the British Museum in Add. 22, 603, and in Ashmole MS. 38. Their title, ""Mr. Herrick's charge to his wife,"" led Mr. Payne Collier to rashly identify with the poet a certain Robert Herrick married at St. Clement Danes, 1632, to a Jane Gibbons. The variants are numerous, but not very important. In l. 4 we have ""draw wooers"" for ""draw thousands""; ll. 11-16 are transposed to after l. 28; and ""Are the expressions of that itch"" is written ""As emblems will express that itch""; ll. 27, 28 appear as:-- "
1719,--R. HERRICK.,"""For that once lost thou _needst must fall To one, then prostitute to all:_ "
1721,--R. HERRICK.,"Nor so immurèd would I have Thee live, as dead, _or_ in thy grave; But walk abroad, yet wisely well _Keep 'gainst_ my coming sentinel. And think _each man thou seest doth doom Thy thoughts to say, I back am come._ "
1723,--R. HERRICK.,"""Let them _call thee wondrous fair, Crown of women_, yet despair"". "
1724,--R. HERRICK.,"Eight lines lower ""virtuous"" is read for ""gentle,"" and the omission of some small words throws some light on a change in Herrick's metrical views as he grew older. The words omitted are bracketed:-- "
1725,--R. HERRICK.,"""[And] Let thy dreams be only fed With this, that I am in thy bed. And [thou] then turning in that sphere, Waking findst [shall find] me sleeping there. But [yet] if boundless lust must scale Thy fortress and _must_ needs prevail _'Gainst thee and_ force a passage in,"" etc. "
1726,--R. HERRICK.,"Other variants are: ""Creates the action"" for ""That makes the action""; ""Glory"" for ""Triumph""; ""my last signet"" for ""this compression""; ""turn again in my full triumph"" for ""come again, As one triumphant,"" and ""the height of womankind"" for ""all faith of womankind"". "
1727,--R. HERRICK.,"_The body sins not, 'tis the will_, etc. A maxim of law Latin: Actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea. "
1728,--R. HERRICK.,"466. _To his Kinsman, Sir Thos. Soame_, son of Sir Stephen Soame, Lord Mayor of London, 1589, and of Anne Stone, Herrick's aunt. Sir Thomas was Sheriff of London, 1635, M.P. for the City, 1640, and died Jan., 1670. See Cussan's _Hertfortshire_. (_Hundred of Edwinstree_, p. 100.) "
1729,--R. HERRICK.,"470. _Few Fortunate._ A variant on the text (Matt. xx. 16): ""Many be called but few chosen"". "
1730,--R. HERRICK.,"479. _To Rosemary and Bays._ The use of rosemary and bays at weddings forms a section in Brand's chapter on marriage customs (ii. 119). For the gilding he quotes from a wedding sermon preached in 1607 by Roger Hacket: ""Smell sweet, O ye flowers, in your native sweetness: be not gilded with the idle art of man"". The use of gloves at weddings forms the subject of another section in Brand (ii. 125). He quotes Ben Jonson's _Silent Woman_; ""We see no ensigns of a wedding here, no character of a bridal; where be our scarves and our gloves?"" "
1731,--R. HERRICK.,"483. _To his worthy friend, M. Thomas Falconbrige._ As Herrick hints at his friend's destiny for a public career, it seemed worth while to hunt through the Calendar of State Papers for a chance reference to this Falconbridge, who so far has evaded editors. He is apparently the Mr. Thomas Falconbridge who appears in various papers between 1640 and 1644, as passing accounts, and in the latter year was ""Receiver-General at Westminster"". "
1732,--R. HERRICK.,"_Towers reared high_, etc. Cp. Horace, _Od._ II. x. 9-12. "
1733,--R. HERRICK.,"Saepius ventis agitatur ingens Pinus, et celsae graviore casu Decidunt turres, feriuntque summos Fulgura montes. "
1734,--R. HERRICK.,"486. _He's lord of thy life_, etc. Seneca, _Epist. Mor._ iv.: Quisquis vitam suam contempsit tuae dominus est. Quoted by Montaigne, I. xxiii. "
1735,--R. HERRICK.,"488. _Shame is a bad attendant to a state._ From Seneca, _Hippol._ 431: Malus est minister regii imperii pudor. "
1736,--R. HERRICK.,"_He rents his crown that fears the people's hate._ Also from Seneca, _Oedipus_, 701: Odia qui nimium timet regnare nescit. "
1737,--R. HERRICK.,"496. _To his honoured kinsman, Sir Richard Stone_, son of John Stone, sergeant-at-law, the brother of Julian Stone, Herrick's mother. He died in 1660. "
1738,--R. HERRICK.,"_To this white temple of my heroes._ Ben Jonson's admirers were proud to call themselves ""sealed of the tribe of Ben,"" and Herrick, a devout Jonsonite, seems to have imitated the idea so far as to plan sometimes, as here, a Temple, sometimes a Book (see _infra_, 510), sometimes a City (365), a Plantation (392), a Calendar (545), a College (983), of his own favourite friends, to whom his poetry was to give immortality. The earliest direct reference to this plan is in his address to John Selden, the antiquary (365), in which he writes:-- "
1739,--R. HERRICK.,"""A city here of heroes I have made Upon the rock whose firm foundation laid Shall never shrink; where, making thine abode, Live thou a Selden, that's a demi-god"". "
1740,--R. HERRICK.,"It is noteworthy that the poems which contain the clearest reference to this Temple (or its variants) are mostly addressed to kinsfolk, _e.g._, this to Sir Richard Stone, to Mrs. Penelope Wheeler, to Mr. Stephen Soame, and to Susanna and Thomas Herrick. Other recipients of the honour are Sir Edward Fish and Dr. Alabaster, Jack Crofts, Master J. Jincks, etc. "
1741,--R. HERRICK.,"497. _All flowers sent_, etc. See Virgil's--or the Virgilian--_Culex_, ll. 397-410. "
1743,--R. HERRICK.,"De ape electro inclusa. Et latet et lucet Phaethontide condita gutta, Ut videatur apis nectare clausa suo. Dignum tantorum pretium tulit illa laborum. Credibile est ipsam sic voluisse mori. "
1744,--R. HERRICK.,"500. _To Mistress Dorothy Parsons._ This ""saint"" from Herrick's Temple may certainly be identified with the second of the three children (William, Dorothy, and Thomasine) of Mr. John Parsons, organist and master of the choristers at Westminster Abbey, where he was buried in 1623. Herrick addresses another poem to her sister Thomasine:-- "
1745,--R. HERRICK.,"""Grow up in beauty, as thou dost begin, And be of all admired, Thomasine"". "
1746,--R. HERRICK.,"502. _'Tis sin to throttle wine._ Martial, I. xix. 5: Scelus est jugulare Falernum. "
1747,--R. HERRICK.,"506. _Edward, Earl of Dorset_, Knight of the Garter, grandson of Thomas Sackville, author of _Gorboduc_. He succeeded his brother, Richard Sackville, the third earl, in 1624, and died in 1652. Clarendon describes a duel which he fought with Lord Bruce in Flanders. "
1748,--R. HERRICK.,"_Of your own self a public theatre._ Cp. Burton (Democ. to Reader) ""Ipse mihi theatrum"". "

1785,--R. HERRICK.,"Errors in the numbering system, despite the corrections mentioned in the NOTE TO SECOND EDITION, still exist in the text. A clear example is shown by _569.

When the poems within the APPENDIX OF EPIGRAMS are considered, more errors in the numeration system become apparent. "

1811,569. A HYMN TO THE GRACES.,"When I love (as some have told, Love I shall when I am old), O ye Graces! make me fit For the welcoming of it. Clean my rooms, as temples be, T' entertain that deity. Give me words wherewith to woo, Suppling and successful too; Winning postures, and, withal, Manners each way musical: Sweetness to allay my sour And unsmooth behaviour. For I know you have the skill Vines to prune, though not to kill, And of any wood ye see, You can make a Mercury. "

1821,575. THE APPARITION OF HIS MISTRESS CALLING HIM TO ELYSIUM.,"Come then, and like two doves with silv'ry wings, Let our souls fly to th' shades where ever springs Sit smiling in the meads; where balm and oil, Roses and cassia crown the untill'd soil. Where no disease reigns, or infection comes To blast the air, but ambergris and gums This, that, and ev'ry thicket doth transpire, More sweet than storax from the hallowed fire, Where ev'ry tree a wealthy issue bears Of fragrant apples, blushing plums, or pears; And all the shrubs, with sparkling spangles, shew Like morning sunshine tinselling the dew. Here in green meadows sits eternal May, Purfling the margents, while perpetual day So double gilds the air, as that no night Can ever rust th' enamel of the light. Here, naked younglings, handsome striplings, run Their goals for virgins' kisses; which when done, Then unto dancing forth the learned round Commixed they meet, with endless roses crown'd. And here we'll sit on primrose-banks, and see Love's chorus led by Cupid; and we'll be Two loving followers, too, unto the grove Where poets sing the stories of our love. There thou shalt hear divine Musæus sing Of Hero and Leander; then I'll bring Thee to the stand, where honour'd Homer reads His Odysseys and his high Iliads; About whose throne the crowd of poets throng To hear the incantation of his tongue: To Linus, then to Pindar; and that done, I'll bring thee, Herrick, to Anacreon, Quaffing his full-crown'd bowls of burning wine, And in his raptures speaking lines of thine, Like to his subject; and as his frantic Looks show him truly Bacchanalian-like Besmear'd with grapes, welcome he shall thee thither, Where both may rage, both drink and dance together. Then stately Virgil, witty Ovid, by Whom fair Corinna sits, and doth comply With ivory wrists his laureate head, and steeps His eye in dew of kisses while he sleeps; Then soft Catullus, sharp-fang'd Martial, And towering Lucan, Horace, Juvenal, And snaky Persius, these, and those, whom rage (Dropt for the jars of heaven) fill'd t' engage All times unto their frenzies,--thou shalt there Behold them in a spacious theatre. Among which glories, crowned with sacred bays And flatt'ring ivy, two recite their plays-- Beaumont and Fletcher, swans to whom all ears Listen, while they, like syrens in their spheres, Sing their Evadne; and still more for thee There yet remains to know than thou can'st see By glim'ring of a fancy. Do but come, And there I'll show thee that capacious room In which thy father Jonson now is plac'd, As in a globe of radiant fire, and grac'd To be in that orb crown'd, that doth include Those prophets of the former magnitude, And he one chief; but hark, I hear the cock (The bellman of the night) proclaim the clock Of late struck one, and now I see the prime Of day break from the pregnant east: 'tis time I vanish; more I had to say, But night determines here, away. "

1824,576. LIFE IS THE BODY'S LIGHT.,"Life is the body's light, which once declining, Those crimson clouds i' th' cheek and lips leave shining. Those counter-changed tabbies in the air (The sun once set) all of one colour are. So, when Death comes, fresh tinctures lose their place, And dismal darkness then doth smutch the face. "
1827,579. LOVE LIGHTLY PLEASED.,"Let fair or foul my mistress be, Or low, or tall, she pleaseth me; Or let her walk, or stand, or sit, The posture hers, I'm pleas'd with it; Or let her tongue be still, or stir, Graceful is every thing from her; Or let her grant, or else deny, _My love will fit each history_. "
1829,580. THE PRIMROSE.,"Ask me why I send you here This sweet Infanta of the year? Ask me why I send to you This primrose, thus bepearl'd with dew? I will whisper to your ears: The sweets of love are mix'd with tears. "
1830,580. THE PRIMROSE.,"Ask me why this flower does show So yellow-green, and sickly too? Ask me why the stalk is weak And bending (yet it doth not break)? I will answer: These discover What fainting hopes are in a lover. "
1832,581. THE TITHE. TO THE BRIDE.,"If nine times you your bridegroom kiss, The tenth you know the parson's is. Pay then your tithe, and doing thus, Prove in your bride-bed numerous. If children you have ten, Sir John Won't for his tenth part ask you one. "
1835,582. A FROLIC.,"Bring me my rosebuds, drawer, come; So, while I thus sit crown'd, I'll drink the aged Cæcubum, Until the roof turn round. "

1840,584. TO JULIA.,"The saints'-bell calls, and, Julia, I must read The proper lessons for the saints now dead: To grace which service, Julia, there shall be One holy collect said or sung for thee. Dead when thou art, dear Julia, thou shalt have A trentall sung by virgins o'er thy grave: Meantime we two will sing the dirge of these, Who dead, deserve our best remembrances. "
1843,585. NO LUCK IN LOVE.,"I do love I know not what, Sometimes this and sometimes that; All conditions I aim at. "
1844,585. NO LUCK IN LOVE.,"But, as luckless, I have yet Many shrewd disasters met To gain her whom I would get. "
1845,585. NO LUCK IN LOVE.,"Therefore now I'll love no more As I've doted heretofore: He who must be, shall be poor. "
1847,586. IN THE DARK NONE DAINTY.,"Night hides our thefts, all faults then pardon'd be; All are alike fair when no spots we see. Lais and Lucrece in the night-time are Pleasing alike, alike both singular: Joan and my lady have at that time one, One and the self-same priz'd complexion: Then please alike the pewter and the plate, The chosen ruby, and the reprobate.

TO HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW, MASTER JOHN WINGFIELD.","For being comely, consonant, and free To most of men, but most of all to me; For so decreeing that thy clothes' expense Keeps still within a just circumference; Then for contriving so to load thy board As that the messes ne'er o'erlade the lord; Next for ordaining that thy words not swell To any one unsober syllable: These I could praise thee for beyond another, Wert thou a Winstfield only, not a brother. "
1855,591. THE HEADACHE.,"My head doth ache, O Sappho! take Thy fillet, And bind the pain, Or bring some bane To kill it. "
1856,591. THE HEADACHE.,But less that part Than my poor heart Now is sick; One kiss from thee Will counsel be And physic.

1877,603. TO HIS BOOK.,"Be bold, my book, nor be abash'd, or fear The cutting thumb-nail or the brow severe; But by the Muses swear all here is good If but well read, or, ill read, understood. "

1891,609. OF LOVE.,"I'll get me hence, Because no fence Or fort that I can make here, But love by charms, Or else by arms Will storm, or starving take here. "
1893,611. TO HIS MUSE.,"Go woo young Charles no more to look Than but to read this in my book: How Herrick begs, if that he can- Not like the muse, to love the man, Who by the shepherds sung, long since, The star-led birth of Charles the Prince. "
1894,611. TO HIS MUSE.,"_Long since_, _i.e._, in the ""Pastoral upon the Birth of Prince Charles"" (213), where see Note. "
1896,612. THE BAD SEASON MAKES THE POET SAD.,"Dull to myself, and almost dead to these My many fresh and fragrant mistresses; Lost to all music now, since everything Puts on the semblance here of sorrowing. Sick is the land to the heart, and doth endure More dangerous faintings by her desp'rate cure. But if that golden age would come again, And Charles here rule, as he before did reign; If smooth and unperplexed the seasons were, As when the sweet Maria lived here: I should delight to have my curls half drown'd In Tyrian dews, and head with roses crown'd; And once more yet, ere I am laid out dead, _Knock at a star with my exalted head_.

1903,615. PURPOSES.,"No wrath of men or rage of seas Can shake a just man's purposes: No threats of tyrants or the grim Visage of them can alter him; But what he doth at first intend, That he holds firmly to the end. "
1905,616. TO THE MAIDS TO WALK ABROAD.,"Come, sit we under yonder tree, Where merry as the maids we'll be; And as on primroses we sit, We'll venture, if we can, at wit: If not, at draw-gloves we will play; So spend some minutes of the day: Or else spin out the thread of sands, Playing at Questions and Commands: Or tell what strange tricks love can do, By quickly making one of two. Thus we will sit and talk, but tell No cruel truths of Philomel, Or Phyllis, whom hard fate forc'd on To kill herself for Demophon. But fables we'll relate: how Jove Put on all shapes to get a love; As now a satyr, then a swan; A bull but then, and now a man. Next we will act how young men woo, And sigh, and kiss as lovers do; And talk of brides, and who shall make That wedding-smock, this bridal cake, That dress, this sprig, that leaf, this vine, That smooth and silken columbine. This done, we'll draw lots who shall buy And gild the bays and rosemary; What posies for our wedding rings; What gloves we'll give and ribandings: And smiling at ourselves, decree, Who then the joining priest shall be. What short, sweet prayers shall be said; And how the posset shall be made With cream of lilies, not of kine, And maiden's-blush, for spiced wine. Thus, having talked, we'll next commend A kiss to each, and so we'll end. "
1906,616. TO THE MAIDS TO WALK ABROAD.,"_Draw-gloves_, talking on the fingers. _Philomela_, daughter of Pandion, changed into a nightingale. _Phyllis_, the S. Phyllis of a former lyric (To Groves). _Gild the bays_, see Note to 479. "
1908,617. HIS OWN EPITAPH.,"As wearied pilgrims, once possest Of long'd-for lodging, go to rest, So I, now having rid my way, Fix here my button'd staff and stay. Youth, I confess, hath me misled; But age hath brought me right to bed. "

1911,"618. A NUPTIAL VERSE TO MISTRESS ELIZABETH LEE, NOW LADY TRACY.","Spring with the lark, most comely bride, and meet Your eager bridegroom with auspicious feet. The morn's far spent, and the immortal sun Corals his cheek to see those rites not done. Fie, lovely maid! indeed you are too slow, When to the temple Love should run, not go. Dispatch your dressing then, and quickly wed; Then feast, and coy't a little, then to bed. This day is Love's day, and this busy night Is yours, in which you challenged are to fight With such an arm'd, but such an easy foe, As will, if you yield, lie down conquer'd too. The field is pitch'd, but such must be your wars, As that your kisses must outvie the stars. Fall down together vanquished both, and lie Drown'd in the blood of rubies there, not die. "

1934,626. TO HIS VERSES.,"What will ye, my poor orphans, do When I must leave the world and you? Who'll give ye then a sheltering shed, Or credit ye when I am dead? Who'll let ye by their fire sit, Although ye have a stock of wit Already coin'd to pay for it? I cannot tell, unless there be Some race of old humanity Left, of the large heart and long hand, Alive, as noble Westmorland, Or gallant Newark, which brave two May fost'ring fathers be to you. If not, expect to be no less Ill us'd, than babes left fatherless. "

1940,628. UPON LOVE.,"In a dream, Love bade me go To the galleys there to row; In the vision I ask'd why? Love as briefly did reply, 'Twas better there to toil, than prove The turmoils they endure that love. I awoke, and then I knew What Love said was too-too true; Henceforth therefore I will be, As from love, from trouble free. _None pities him that's in the snare, And, warned before, would not beware._ "

1956,634. TO HIS LOVELY MISTRESSES.,"One night i' th' year, my dearest beauties, come And bring those due drink-offerings to my tomb. When thence ye see my reverend ghost to rise, And there to lick th' effused sacrifice: Though paleness be the livery that I wear, Look ye not wan or colourless for fear. Trust me, I will not hurt ye, or once show The least grim look, or cast a frown on you: Nor shall the tapers when I'm there burn blue. This I may do, perhaps, as I glide by, Cast on my girls a glance and loving eye, Or fold mine arms and sigh, because I've lost The world so soon, and in it you the most. Than these, no fears more on your fancies fall, Though then I smile and speak no words at all. "

Give for bread a little bit Of a pea that 'gins to chit, And my full thanks take for it. Flour of fuzz-balls, that's too good For a man in needihood; But the meal of milldust can Well content a craving man. Any orts the elves refuse Well will serve the beggar's use. But if this may seem too much For an alms, then give me such Little bits that nestle there In the prisoner's panier.

Thaw'd are the snows, and now the lusty spring Gives to each mead a neat enamelling. The palms put forth their gems, and every tree Now swaggers in her leafy gallantry. The while the Daulian minstrel sweetly sings, With warbling notes, her Terean sufferings. What gentle winds perspire! As if here Never had been the northern plunderer To strip the trees and fields, to their distress, Leaving them to a pitied nakedness. And look how when a frantic storm doth tear A stubborn oak, or holm, long growing there, But lull'd to calmness, then succeeds a breeze That scarcely stirs the nodding leaves of trees: So when this war, which tempest-like doth spoil Our salt, our corn, our honey, wine and oil, Falls to a temper, and doth mildly cast His inconsiderate frenzy off, at last, The gentle dove may, when these turmoils cease, Bring in her bill, once more, the branch of peace.

Besides rare sweets, I had a book which none Could read the intext but myself alone. About the cover of this book there went A curious-comely clean compartlement, And, in the midst, to grace it more, was set A blushing, pretty, peeping rubelet. But now 'tis closed; and being shut and seal'd, Be it, O be it, never more reveal'd! Keep here still, Closet-Gods, 'fore whom I've set Oblations oft of sweetest marmelet. "

2020,BEDCHAMBER TO HIS MAJESTY.,"Sweet country life, to such unknown Whose lives are others', not their own! But serving courts and cities, be Less happy, less enjoying thee. Thou never plough'st the ocean's foam To seek and bring rough pepper home; Nor to the Eastern Ind dost rove To bring from thence the scorched clove; Nor, with the loss of thy lov'd rest, Bring'st home the ingot from the West. No, thy ambition's masterpiece Flies no thought higher than a fleece; Or how to pay thy hinds, and clear All scores, and so to end the year: But walk'st about thine own dear bounds, Not envying others larger grounds: For well thou know'st _'tis not th' extent Of land makes life, but sweet content_. When now the cock (the ploughman's horn) Calls forth the lily-wristed morn, Then to thy corn-fields thou dost go, Which though well soil'd, yet thou dost know That the best compost for the lands Is the wise master's feet and hands. There at the plough thou find'st thy team With a hind whistling there to them; And cheer'st them up by singing how The kingdom's portion is the plough. This done, then to th' enamelled meads Thou go'st, and as thy foot there treads, Thou see'st a present God-like power Imprinted in each herb and flower; And smell'st the breath of great-ey'd kine, Sweet as the blossoms of the vine. Here thou behold'st thy large sleek neat Unto the dew-laps up in meat; And, as thou look'st, the wanton steer, The heifer, cow, and ox draw near To make a pleasing pastime there. These seen, thou go'st to view thy flocks Of sheep, safe from the wolf and fox, And find'st their bellies there as full Of short sweet grass as backs with wool, And leav'st them, as they feed and fill, A shepherd piping on a hill. For sports, for pageantry and plays Thou hast thy eves and holidays; On which the young men and maids meet To exercise their dancing feet; Tripping the comely country round, With daffodils and daisies crown'd. Thy wakes, thy quintels here thou hast, Thy May-poles, too, with garlands grac'd; Thy morris dance, thy Whitsun ale, Thy shearing feast which never fail; Thy harvest-home, thy wassail bowl, That's toss'd up after fox i' th' hole; Thy mummeries, thy Twelfth-tide kings And queens, thy Christmas revellings, Thy nut-brown mirth, thy russet wit, And no man pays too dear for it. To these, thou hast thy times to go And trace the hare i' th' treacherous snow; Thy witty wiles to draw, and get The lark into the trammel net; Thou hast thy cockrood and thy glade To take the precious pheasant made; Thy lime-twigs, snares and pit-falls then To catch the pilfering birds, not men. O happy life! if that their good The husbandmen but understood! Who all the day themselves do please, And younglings, with such sports as these, And lying down have nought t' affright Sweet sleep, that makes more short the night. _Cætera desunt ----_ "

"
2029,665. WHAT KIND OF MISTRESS HE WOULD HAVE.,"Be the mistress of my choice Clean in manners, clear in voice; Be she witty more than wise, Pure enough, though not precise; Be she showing in her dress Like a civil wilderness; That the curious may detect Order in a sweet neglect; Be she rolling in her eye, Tempting all the passers-by; And each ringlet of her hair An enchantment, or a snare For to catch the lookers-on; But herself held fast by none. Let her Lucrece all day be, Thais in the night to me. Be she such as neither will _Famish me, nor overfill_. "

2035,"670. A PARANÆTICALL, OR ADVISIVE VERSE, TO HIS FRIEND, M. JOHN WICKS.","Is this a life, to break thy sleep, To rise as soon as day doth peep? To tire thy patient ox or ass By noon, and let thy good days pass, Not knowing this, that Jove decrees Some mirth t' adulce man's miseries? No; 'tis a life to have thine oil Without extortion from thy soil; Thy faithful fields to yield thee grain, Although with some, yet little, pain; To have thy mind, and nuptial bed, With fears and cares uncumbered; A pleasing wife, that by thy side Lies softly panting like a bride. This is to live, and to endear Those minutes Time has lent us here. Then, while fates suffer, live thou free As is that air that circles thee, And crown thy temples too, and let Thy servant, not thy own self, sweat, To strut thy barns with sheafs of wheat. Time steals away like to a stream, And we glide hence away with them. _No sound recalls the hours once fled, Or roses, being withered_; Nor us, my friend, when we are lost, Like to a dew or melted frost. Then live we mirthful while we should, And turn the iron age to gold. Let's feast, and frolic, sing, and play, And thus less last than live our day. _Whose life with care is overcast, That man's not said to live, but last; Nor is't a life, seven years to tell, But for to live that half seven well;_ And that we'll do, as men who know, Some few sands spent, we hence must go, Both to be blended in the urn From whence there's never a return.

2040,672. LOVE.,"This axiom I have often heard, _Kings ought to be more lov'd than fear'd_. "
2042,673. TO M. DENHAM ON HIS PROSPECTIVE POEM.,"Or look'd I back unto the times hence flown To praise those Muses and dislike our own-- Or did I walk those Pæan-gardens through, To kick the flowers and scorn their odours too-- I might, and justly, be reputed here One nicely mad or peevishly severe. But by Apollo! as I worship wit, Where I have cause to burn perfumes to it; So, I confess, 'tis somewhat to do well In our high art, although we can't excel Like thee, or dare the buskins to unloose Of thy brave, bold, and sweet Maronian muse. But since I'm call'd, rare Denham, to be gone, Take from thy Herrick this conclusion: 'Tis dignity in others, if they be Crown'd poets, yet live princes under thee; The while their wreaths and purple robes do shine Less by their own gems than those beams of thine. "
2045,674. A HYMN TO THE LARES.,"It was, and still my care is, To worship ye, the Lares, With crowns of greenest parsley And garlic chives, not scarcely; For favours here to warm me, And not by fire to harm me; For gladding so my hearth here With inoffensive mirth here; That while the wassail bowl here With North-down ale doth troul here, No syllable doth fall here To mar the mirth at all here. For which, O chimney-keepers! (I dare not call ye sweepers) So long as I am able To keep a country table, Great be my fare, or small cheer, I'll eat and drink up all here. "

2054,678. TO ANTHEA.,"Come, Anthea, know thou this, _Love at no time idle is_; Let's be doing, though we play But at push-pin half the day; Chains of sweet bents let us make Captive one, or both, to take: In which bondage we will lie, Souls transfusing thus, and die. "

TO THE KING.,"Give way, give way! now, now my Charles shines here A public light, in this immensive sphere; Some stars were fix'd before, but these are dim Compar'd, in this my ample orb, to him. Draw in your feeble fires, while that he Appears but in his meaner majesty. Where, if such glory flashes from his name, Which is his shade, who can abide his flame! _Princes, and such like public lights as these, Must not be look'd on but at distances: For, if we gaze on these brave lamps too near, Our eyes they'll blind, or if not blind, they'll blear._ "
2074,686. THE FUNERAL RITES OF THE ROSE.,"The rose was sick, and smiling died; And, being to be sanctified, About the bed there sighing stood The sweet and flowery sisterhood. Some hung the head, while some did bring, To wash her, water from the spring. Some laid her forth, while others wept, But all a solemn fast there kept. The holy sisters, some among, The sacred dirge and trentall sung. But ah! what sweets smelt everywhere, As heaven had spent all perfumes there. At last, when prayers for the dead And rites were all accomplished, They, weeping, spread a lawny loom And clos'd her up, as in a tomb. "

Manners! fram'd to please All nations, customs, kindreds, languages! I am a free-born Roman; suffer, then, That I amongst you live a citizen. London my home is: though by hard fate sent Into a long and irksome banishment; Yet since call'd back; henceforward let me be, O native country, repossess'd by thee! For, rather than I'll to the West return, I'll beg of thee first here to have mine urn. Weak I am grown, and must in short time fall; Give thou my sacred relics burial. "
2134,714. NOT EVERY DAY FIT FOR VERSE.,"'Tis not ev'ry day that I Fitted am to prophesy; No; but when the spirit fills The fantastic pannicles Full of fire, then I write As the godhead doth indite. Thus enrag'd, my lines are hurled, Like the Sybil's, through the world. Look how next the holy fire Either slakes, or doth retire; So the fancy cools, till when That brave spirit comes again. "

2166,720. PROOF TO NO PURPOSE.,"You see this gentle stream that glides, Shov'd on by quick-succeeding tides; Try if this sober stream you can Follow to th' wilder ocean; And see if there it keeps unspent In that congesting element. Next, from that world of waters, then By pores and caverns back again Induct that inadult'rate same Stream to the spring from whence it came. This with a wonder when ye do, As easy, and else easier too, Then may ye recollect the grains Of my particular remains, After a thousand lusters hurl'd By ruffling winds about the world. "

Next, like a bishop consecrate my ground, That lucky fairies here may dance their round; And after that, lay down some silver pence The master's charge and care to recompense.

2174,"724. HIS GRANGE, OR PRIVATE WEALTH.","Though clock, To tell how night draws hence, I've none, A cock I have to sing how day draws on.

A goose I have, which with a jealous ear Lets loose Her tongue to tell that danger's near. A lamb I keep, tame, with my morsels fed, Whose dam An orphan left him, lately dead. A cat I keep that plays about my house, Grown fat With eating many a miching mouse. To these A Tracy[A] I do keep whereby I please The more my rural privacy; Which are But toys to give my heart some ease; Where care None is, slight things do lightly please. "

I am a bird, and though no name I tell, My warbling note will say I'm Philomel. _Ch._ What's that to me? I waft nor fish or fowls, Nor beasts, fond thing, but only human souls. _Ph._ Alas for me! _Ch._ Shame on thy witching note That made me thus hoist sail and bring my boat: But I'll return; what mischief brought thee hither? _Ph._ A deal of love and much, much grief together. _Ch._ What's thy request? _Ph._ That since she's now beneath Who fed my life, I'll follow her in death. _Ch._ And is that all? I'm gone. _Ph._ By love I pray thee. _Ch._ Talk not of love; all pray, but few souls pay me. _Ph._ I'll give thee vows and tears. _Ch._ Can tears pay scores For mending sails, for patching boat and oars? _Ph._ I'll beg a penny, or I'll sing so long Till thou shalt say I've paid thee with a song. _Ch._ Why then begin; and all the while we make Our slothful passage o'er the Stygian Lake, Thou and I'll sing to make these dull shades merry, Who else with tears would doubtless drown my ferry.

2205,737. LOVERS: HOW THEY COME AND PART.,"A gyges' ring they bear about them still, To be, and not seen when and where they will. They tread on clouds, and though they sometimes fall, They fall like dew, but make no noise at all. So silently they one to th' other come, As colours steal into the pear or plum, And air-like, leave no pression to be seen Where'er they met or parting place has been. "

2227,"745. TO SIR JOHN BERKLEY, GOVERNOR OF EXETER.","Stand forth, brave man, since fate has made thee here The Hector over aged Exeter, Who for a long, sad time has weeping stood Like a poor lady lost in widowhood, But fears not now to see her safety sold, As other towns and cities were, for gold By those ignoble births which shame the stem That gave progermination unto them: Whose restless ghosts shall hear their children sing, ""Our sires betrayed their country and their king"". True, if this city seven times rounded was With rock, and seven times circumflank'd with brass, Yet if thou wert not, Berkley, loyal proof, The senators, down tumbling with the roof, Would into prais'd, but pitied, ruins fall, Leaving no show where stood the capitol. But thou art just and itchless, and dost please Thy Genius with two strengthening buttresses, Faith and affection, which will never slip To weaken this thy great dictatorship. "

2230,746. TO ELECTRA. LOVE LOOKS FOR LOVE.,"Love love begets, then never be Unsoft to him who's smooth to thee.

2255,756. TO PRINCE CHARLES UPON HIS COMING TO EXETER.,"What fate decreed, time now has made us see, A renovation of the west by thee. That preternatural fever, which did threat Death to our country, now hath lost his heat, And, calms succeeding, we perceive no more Th' unequal pulse to beat, as heretofore. Something there yet remains for thee to do; Then reach those ends that thou wast destin'd to. Go on with Sylla's fortune; let thy fate Make thee like him, this, that way fortunate: Apollo's image side with thee to bless Thy war (discreetly made) with white success. Meantime thy prophets watch by watch shall pray, While young Charles fights, and fighting wins the day: That done, our smooth-paced poems all shall be Sung in the high doxology of thee. Then maids shall strew thee, and thy curls from them Receive with songs a flowery diadem. "

2260,758. PRINCES AND FAVOURITES.,"Princes and fav'rites are most dear, while they By giving and receiving hold the play; But the relation then of both grows poor, When these can ask, and kings can give no more. "

2266,761. THE WAKE.,"Come, Anthea, let us two Go to feast, as others do. Tarts and custards, creams and cakes, Are the junkets still at wakes: Unto which the tribes resort, Where the business is the sport. Morris-dancers thou shall see, Marian, too, in pageantry, And a mimic to devise Many grinning properties. Players there will be, and those Base in action as in clothes; Yet with strutting they will please The incurious villages. Near the dying of the day There will be a cudgel-play, Where a coxcomb will be broke Ere a good word can be spoke: But the anger ends all here, Drenched in ale, or drown'd in beer. Happy rustics! best content With the cheapest merriment, And possess no other fear Than to want the wake next year. "
2267,761. THE WAKE.,"_Marian_, Maid Marian of the Robin Hood ballads. _Action_, _i.e._, dramatic action. _Incurious_, careless, easily pleased. _Coxcomb_, to cause blood to flow from the opponent's head was the test of victory. "

2274,763. TO DOCTOR ALABASTER.,"Nor art thou less esteem'd that I have plac'd, Amongst mine honour'd, thee almost the last: In great processions many lead the way To him who is the triumph of the day, As these have done to thee who art the one, One only glory of a million: In whom the spirit of the gods does dwell, Firing thy soul, by which thou dost foretell When this or that vast dynasty must fall Down to a fillet more imperial; When this or that horn shall be broke, and when Others shall spring up in their place again; When times and seasons and all years must lie Drowned in the sea of wild eternity; When the black doomsday books, as yet unseal'd, Shall by the mighty angel be reveal'd; And when the trumpet which thou late hast found Shall call to judgment. Tell us when the sound Of this or that great April day shall be, And next the Gospel we will credit thee. Meantime like earth-worms we will crawl below, And wonder at those things that thou dost know. "
2275,763. TO DOCTOR ALABASTER.,"For an account of Alabaster see Notes: the allusions here are to his apocalyptic writings. _Horn_, used as a symbol of prosperity. _The trumpet which thou late hast found_, _i.e._, Alabaster's ""Spiraculum Tubarum seu Fons Spiritualium Expositionum,"" published 1633. _April day_, day of weeping, or perhaps rather of ""opening"" or revelation. "
2277,"764. UPON HIS KINSWOMAN, MRS. M. S.","Here lies a virgin, and as sweet As e'er was wrapt in winding sheet. Her name if next you would have known, The marble speaks it, Mary Stone: Who dying in her blooming years, This stone for name's sake melts to tears. If, fragrant virgins, you'll but keep A fast, while jets and marbles weep, And praying, strew some roses on her, You'll do my niece abundant honour. "
2279,765. FELICITY KNOWS NO FENCE.,"Of both our fortunes good and bad we find Prosperity more searching of the mind: Felicity flies o'er the wall and fence, While misery keeps in with patience. "

2288,769. THE SPELL.,"Holy water come and bring; Cast in salt, for seasoning: Set the brush for sprinkling: Sacred spittle bring ye hither; Meal and it now mix together, And a little oil to either. Give the tapers here their light, Ring the saints'-bell, to affright Far from hence the evil sprite. "
2290,770. HIS WISH TO PRIVACY.,"Give me a cell To dwell, Where no foot hath A path: There will I spend And end My wearied years In tears. "
2292,771. A GOOD HUSBAND.,"A Master of a house, as I have read, Must be the first man up, and last in bed. With the sun rising he must walk his grounds; See this, view that, and all the other bounds: Shut every gate; mend every hedge that's torn, Either with old, or plant therein new thorn; Tread o'er his glebe, but with such care, that where He sets his foot, he leaves rich compost there. "
2294,772. A HYMN TO BACCHUS.,"I sing thy praise, Iacchus, Who with thy thyrse dost thwack us: And yet thou so dost back us With boldness, that we fear No Brutus ent'ring here, Nor Cato the severe. What though the lictors threat us, We know they dare not beat us, So long as thou dost heat us. When we thy orgies sing, Each cobbler is a king, Nor dreads he any thing: And though he do not rave, Yet he'll the courage have To call my Lord Mayor knave; Besides, too, in a brave, Although he has no riches, But walks with dangling breeches And skirts that want their stitches, And shows his naked flitches, Yet he'll be thought or seen So good as George-a-Green; And calls his blouze, his queen; And speaks in language keen. O Bacchus! let us be From cares and troubles free; And thou shalt hear how we Will chant new hymns to thee. "

2300,774. BLAME THE REWARD OF PRINCES.,"Among disasters that dissension brings, This not the least is, which belongs to kings: If wars go well, each for a part lays claim; If ill, then kings, not soldiers, bear the blame. "
2302,775. CLEMENCY IN KINGS.,"Kings must not only cherish up the good, But must be niggards of the meanest blood. "

2320,781. TO ANTHEA.,"Let's call for Hymen, if agreed thou art; _Delays in love but crucify the heart_. Love's thorny tapers yet neglected lie: Speak thou the word, they'll kindle by-and-bye. The nimble hours woo us on to wed, And Genius waits to have us both to bed. Behold, for us the naked Graces stay With maunds of roses for to strew the way: Besides, the most religious prophet stands Ready to join, as well our hearts as hands. Juno yet smiles; but if she chance to chide, Ill luck 'twill bode to th' bridegroom and the bride. Tell me, Anthea, dost thou fondly dread The loss of that we call a maidenhead? Come, I'll instruct thee. Know, the vestal fire Is not by marriage quench'd, but flames the higher. "

2325,783. THE INVITATION.,"To sup with thee thou did'st me home invite; And mad'st a promise that mine appetite Should meet and tire on such lautitious meat, The like not Heliogabalus did eat: And richer wine would'st give to me, thy guest, Than Roman Sylla pour'd out at his feast. I came, 'tis true, and looked for fowl of price, The bastard phœnix, bird of paradise, And for no less than aromatic wine Of maiden's-blush, commix'd with jessamine. Clean was the hearth, the mantel larded jet; Which wanting Lar, and smoke, hung weeping wet; At last, i' th' noon of winter, did appear A ragg'd-soust-neat's-foot with sick vinegar: And in a burnished flagonet stood by, Beer small as comfort, dead as charity. At which amaz'd, and pondering on the food, How cold it was, and how it chill'd my blood; I curs'd the master, and I damn'd the souce, And swore I'd got the ague of the house. Well, when to eat thou dost me next desire, I'll bring a fever, since thou keep'st no fire. "

2333,"785. CHRISTMAS-EVE, ANOTHER CEREMONY.","Come guard this night the Christmas-pie, That the thief, though ne'er so sly, With his flesh-hooks, don't come nigh To catch it From him, who all alone sits there, Having his eyes still in his ear, And a deal of nightly fear, To watch it. "
2335,786. ANOTHER TO THE MAIDS.,"Wash your hands, or else the fire Will not teend to your desire; Unwash'd hands, ye maidens, know, Dead the fire, though ye blow. "

2355,797. KISSES.,Give me the food that satisfies a guest: Kisses are but dry banquets to a feast. 
2357,798. ORPHEUS.,"Orpheus he went, as poets tell, To fetch Eurydice from hell; And had her; but it was upon This short but strict condition: Backward he should not look while he Led her through hell's obscurity: But ah! it happened, as he made His passage through that dreadful shade, Revolve he did his loving eye, For gentle fear or jealousy; And looking back, that look did sever Him and Eurydice for ever. "
2359,803. TO SAPPHO.,"Sappho, I will choose to go Where the northern winds do blow Endless ice and endless snow: Rather than I once would see But a winter's face in thee, To benumb my hopes and me. "

For since I've travell'd all this realm throughout To seek and find some few immortals out To circumspangle this my spacious sphere, As lamps for everlasting shining here; And having fix'd thee in mine orb a star, Amongst the rest, both bright and singular, The present age will tell the world thou art, If not to th' whole, yet satisfi'd in part. As for the rest, being too great a sum Here to be paid, I'll pay't i' th' world to come. "
2363,805. THE BRIDE-CAKE.,"This day, my Julia, thou must make For Mistress Bride the wedding-cake: Knead but the dough, and it will be To paste of almonds turn'd by thee: Or kiss it thou but once or twice, And for the bride-cake there'll be spice. "

THE MAIDEN-BLUSH.,"So look the mornings when the sun Paints them with fresh vermilion: So cherries blush, and Kathern pears, And apricots in youthful years: So corals look more lovely red, And rubies lately polished: So purest diaper doth shine, Stain'd by the beams of claret wine: As Julia looks when she doth dress Her either cheek with bashfulness.

MERCY HERRICK.","Whene'er I go, or whatsoe'er befalls Me in mine age, or foreign funerals, This blessing I will leave thee, ere I go: Prosper thy basket and therein thy dough.

These I but wish for; but thyself shall see The blessing fall in mellow times on thee. "
2391,819. THE TRANSFIGURATION.,"Immortal clothing I put on So soon as, Julia, I am gone To mine eternal mansion. Thou, thou art here, to human sight Cloth'd all with incorrupted light; But yet how more admir'dly bright Wilt thou appear, when thou art set In thy refulgent thronelet, That shin'st thus in thy counterfeit! "
2393,820. SUFFER THAT THOU CANST NOT SHIFT.,"Does fortune rend thee? Bear with thy hard fate: _Virtuous instructions ne'er are delicate_. Say, does she frown? still countermand her threats: _Virtue best loves those children that she beats_. "
2395,821. TO THE PASSENGER.,"If I lie unburied, sir, These my relics pray inter: 'Tis religion's part to see Stones or turfs to cover me. One word more I had to say: But it skills not; go your way; He that wants a burial room _For a stone, has Heaven his tomb_. "

2407,826. BAD PRINCES PILL THE PEOPLE.,"Like those infernal deities which eat The best of all the sacrificed meat; And leave their servants but the smoke and sweat: So many kings, and primates too there are, Who claim the fat and fleshy for their share And leave their subjects but the starved ware.

2423,836. TO ELECTRA.,"Shall I go to Love and tell, Thou art all turned icicle? Shall I say her altars be Disadorn'd and scorn'd by thee? O beware! in time submit; Love has yet no wrathful fit: If her patience turns to ire, Love is then consuming fire. "
2425,837. TO MISTRESS AMY POTTER.,"Ay me! I love; give him your hand to kiss Who both your wooer and your poet is. Nature has precompos'd us both to love: Your part's to grant; my scene must be to move. Dear, can you like, and liking love your poet? If you say ""Aye,"" blush-guiltiness will show it. Mine eyes must woo you, though I sigh the while: _True love is tongueless as a crocodile_. And you may find in love these different parts-- _Wooers have tongues of ice, but burning hearts_. "
2427,838. UPON A MAID.,"Here she lies, in bed of spice, Fair as Eve in Paradise: For her beauty it was such Poets could not praise too much. Virgins, come, and in a ring Her supremest requiem sing; Then depart, but see ye tread Lightly, lightly, o'er the dead. "

2432,840. BEAUTY.,Beauty's no other but a lovely grace Of lively colours flowing from the face. 
2434,841. UPON LOVE.,"Some salve to every sore we may apply; Only for my wound there's no remedy. Yet if my Julia kiss me, there will be A sovereign balm found out to cure me. "
2436,844. TO HIS BOOK.,"Make haste away, and let one be A friendly patron unto thee: Lest, rapt from hence, I see thee lie Torn for the use of pastery: Or see thy injur'd leaves serve well, To make loose gowns for mackerel: Or see the grocers in a trice, Make hoods of thee to serve out spice. "

2448,850. THE DELAYING BRIDE.,"Why so slowly do you move To the centre of your love? On your niceness though we wait, Yet the hours say 'tis late: _Coyness takes us, to a measure; But o'eracted deads the pleasure._ Go to bed, and care not when Cheerful day shall spring again. One brave captain did command, By his word, the sun to stand: One short charm, if you but say, Will enforce the moon to stay, Till you warn her hence, away, T' have your blushes seen by day. "

This day I go to woo; Instruct me how to do This work thou put'st me to. From shame my face keep free; From scorn I beg of thee, Love, to deliver me: So shall I sing thy praise, And to thee altars raise, Unto the end of days. "
2508,875. TO ELECTRA.,Let not thy tombstone e'er be laid by me: Nor let my hearse be wept upon by thee: But let that instant when thou diest be known The minute of mine expiration. One knell be rung for both; and let one grave To hold us two an endless honour have.

2517,883. THE SHOWER OF BLOSSOMS.,"Love in a shower of blossoms came Down, and half drown'd me with the same: The blooms that fell were white and red; But with such sweets comminglèd, As whether--this I cannot tell-- My sight was pleas'd more, or my smell: But true it was, as I roll'd there, Without a thought of hurt or fear, Love turn'd himself into a bee, And with his javelin wounded me: From which mishap this use I make, _Where most sweets are, there lies a snake: Kisses and favours are sweet things; But those have thorns and these have stings._ "
2519,885. A DEFENCE FOR WOMEN.,"Naught are all women: I say no, Since for one bad, one good I know: For Clytemnestra most unkind, Loving Alcestis there we find: For one Medea that was bad, A good Penelope was had: For wanton Lais, then we have Chaste Lucrece, a wife as grave: And thus through womankind we see A good and bad. Sirs, credit me. "

Next, let the lord and lady here Enjoy a Christ'ning year by year; And this good blessing back them still, T' have boys, and girls too, as they will. Then from the porch may many a bride Unto the holy temple ride: And thence return, short prayers said, A wife most richly married.

Never again shall I with finny oar Put from, or draw unto the faithful shore: And landing here, or safely landing there, Make way to my beloved Westminster, Or to the golden Cheapside, where the earth Of Julia Herrick gave to me my birth. May all clean nymphs and curious water-dames With swan-like state float up and down thy streams: No drought upon thy wanton waters fall To make them lean and languishing at all.

2961,"1100. TO HIS BROTHER, NICHOLAS HERRICK.","What others have with cheapness seen and ease In varnish'd maps, by th' help of compasses, Or read in volumes and those books with all Their large narrations incanonical, Thou hast beheld those seas and countries far, And tell'st to us what once they were, and are. So that with bold truth thou can'st now relate This kingdom's fortune, and that empire's fate: Can'st talk to us of Sharon, where a spring Of roses have an endless flourishing; Of Sion, Sinai, Nebo, and with them Make known to us the new Jerusalem; The Mount of Olives, Calvary, and where Is, and hast seen, thy Saviour's sepulchre. So that the man that will but lay his ears As inapostate to the thing he hears, Shall by his hearing quickly come to see The truth of travels less in books than thee. "

2979,1117. ABSTINENCE.,"Against diseases here the strongest fence Is the defensive virtue, abstinence. "

2985,1120. TO CUPID.,"I have a leaden, thou a shaft of gold; Thou kill'st with heat, and I strike dead with cold. Let's try of us who shall the first expire; Or thou by frost, or I by quenchless fire: _Extremes are fatal where they once do strike, And bring to th' heart destruction both alike_. "

2993,1125. TO HIS BOOK.,"Go thou forth, my book, though late: Yet be timely fortunate. It may chance good luck may send Thee a kinsman, or a friend, That may harbour thee, when I With my fates neglected lie. If thou know'st not where to dwell, See, the fire's by: farewell. "
2995,1126. THE END OF HIS WORK.,"Part of the work remains; one part is past: And here my ship rides, having anchor cast. "
2997,1127. TO CROWN IT.,"My wearied bark, O let it now be crown'd! The haven reach'd to which I first was bound. "
2999,1128. ON HIMSELF.,"The work is done: young men and maidens, set Upon my curls the myrtle coronet Washed with sweet ointments: thus at last I come To suffer in the Muses' martyrdom; But with this comfort, if my blood be shed, The Muses will wear blacks when I am dead. "
3002,1129. THE PILLAR OF FAME.,"Fame's pillar here, at last, we set, Outduring  marble,  brass,  or  jet. Charm'd   and   enchanted  so As  to   withstand  the  blow Of o v e r t h r o w; Nor shall  the  seas, Or    o u t r a g e s Of  storms   o'erbear What    we    uprear. Tho'  kingdoms  fall, This   pillar   never   shall Decline  or  waste  at   all; But  stand  for   ever  by  his  own Firm  and   well-fix'd   foundation. "

3018,1. HIS CONFESSION.,"Look how our foul days do exceed our fair; And as our bad, more than our good works are, E'en so those lines, pen'd by my wanton wit, Treble the number of these good I've writ. Things precious are least numerous: men are prone To do ten bad for one good action. "
3020,2. HIS PRAYER FOR ABSOLUTION.,"For those my unbaptised rhymes, Writ in my wild unhallowed times; For every sentence, clause, and word, That's not inlaid with Thee, my Lord, Forgive me, God, and blot each line Out of my book that is not Thine. But if, 'mongst all, thou find'st here one Worthy Thy benediction; That one of all the rest shall be The glory of my work and me. "
3022,3. TO FIND GOD.,"Weigh me the fire; or canst thou find A way to measure out the wind; Distinguish all those floods that are Mix'd in that watery theatre; And taste thou them as saltless there As in their channel first they were. Tell me the people that do keep Within the kingdoms of the deep; Or fetch me back that cloud again Beshiver'd into seeds of rain; Tell me the motes, dust, sands, and spears Of corn, when summer shakes his ears; Show me that world of stars, and whence They noiseless spill their influence: This if thou canst, then show me Him That rides the glorious cherubim. "

3035,9. GOD'S PART.,"Prayers and praises are those spotless two Lambs, by the law, which God requires as due. "
3037,10. AFFLICTION.,"God ne'er afflicts us more than our desert, Though He may seem to overact His part: Sometimes He strikes us more than flesh can bear; But yet still less than grace can suffer here. "
3039,11. THREE FATAL SISTERS.,"Three fatal sisters wait upon each sin; First, fear and shame without, then guilt within. "
3041,12. SILENCE.,"Suffer thy legs, but not thy tongue to walk: God, the Most Wise, is sparing of His talk. "

3045,14. LOADING AND UNLOADING.,"God loads and unloads, thus His work begins, To load with blessings and unload from sins. "
3047,15. GOD'S MERCY.,"God's boundless mercy is, to sinful man, Like to the ever-wealthy ocean: Which though it sends forth thousand streams, 'tis ne'er Known, or else seen, to be the emptier; And though it takes all in, 'tis yet no more Full, and fill'd full, than when full fill'd before. "
3049,16. PRAYERS MUST HAVE POISE.,"God, He rejects all prayers that are slight And want their poise: words ought to have their weight. "

Chor._ I come to Thee, in hope to find Salve for my body and my mind. _Verse._ In Gilead though no balm be found To ease this smart or cure this wound, _Ver. Chor._ Yet, Lord, I know there is with Thee All saving health, and help for me. _Verse._ Then reach Thou forth that hand of Thine, That pours in oil, as well as wine, _Ver. Chor._ And let it work, for I'll endure The utmost smart, so Thou wilt cure. "

3061,22. GOD HAS A TWOFOLD PART.,"God, when for sin He makes His children smart, His own He acts not, but another's part; But when by stripes He saves them, then 'tis known He comes to play the part that is His own. "
3063,23. GOD IS ONE.,"God, as He is most holy known, So He is said to be most one. "
3065,24. PERSECUTIONS PROFITABLE.,"Afflictions they most profitable are To the beholder and the sufferer: Bettering them both, but by a double strain, The first by patience, and the last by pain. "
3067,25. TO GOD.,"Do with me, God, as Thou didst deal with John, Who writ that heavenly Revelation. Let me, like him, first cracks of thunder hear, Then let the harps enchantments stroke mine ear: Here give me thorns, there, in Thy kingdom, set Upon my head the golden coronet; There give me day; but here my dreadful night: My sackcloth here; but there my stole of white. "
3070,26. WHIPS.,"God has His whips here to a twofold end: The bad to punish, and the good t' amend. "
3072,27. GOD'S PROVIDENCE.,"If all transgressions here should have their pay, What need there then be of a reckoning day? If God should punish no sin here of men, His providence who would not question then? "
3074,28. TEMPTATION.,"Those saints which God loves best, The devil tempts not least. "
3076,29. HIS EJACULATION TO GOD.,"My God! look on me with Thine eye Of pity, not of scrutiny; For if Thou dost, Thou then shalt see Nothing but loathsome sores in me. O then, for mercy's sake, behold These my eruptions manifold, And heal me with Thy look or touch; But if Thou wilt not deign so much, Because I'm odious in Thy sight, Speak but the word, and cure me quite. "
3078,30. GOD'S GIFTS NOT SOON GRANTED.,"God hears us when we pray, but yet defers His gifts, to exercise petitioners; And though a while He makes requesters stay, With princely hand He'll recompense delay. "

3084,33. AN ODE OF THE BIRTH OF OUR SAVIOUR.,"In numbers, and but these few, I sing Thy birth, O JESU! Thou pretty baby, born here, With sup'rabundant scorn here; Who for Thy princely port here, Hadst for Thy place Of birth a base Out-stable for Thy court here. "
3085,33. AN ODE OF THE BIRTH OF OUR SAVIOUR.,"Instead of neat enclosures Of interwoven osiers, Instead of fragrant posies Of daffodils and roses, Thy cradle, Kingly Stranger, As Gospel tells, Was nothing else But here a homely manger. "
3086,33. AN ODE OF THE BIRTH OF OUR SAVIOUR.,"But we with silks, not crewels, With sundry precious jewels, And lily-work will dress Thee; And as we dispossess Thee Of clouts, we'll make a chamber, Sweet babe, for Thee Of ivory, And plaister'd round with amber. "
3087,33. AN ODE OF THE BIRTH OF OUR SAVIOUR.,"The Jews they did disdain Thee, But we will entertain Thee With glories to await here, Upon Thy princely state here; And more for love than pity, From year to year, We'll make Thee, here, A freeborn of our city. "
3090,34. LIP-LABOUR.,"In the old Scripture I have often read, The calf without meal ne'er was offered; To figure to us nothing more than this, Without the heart lip-labour nothing is. "

3096,37. SIN SEEN.,"When once the sin has fully acted been, Then is the horror of the trespass seen. "
3098,38. UPON TIME.,"Time was upon The wing, to fly away; And I call'd on Him but awhile to stay; But he'd be gone, For ought that I could say. "
3099,38. UPON TIME.,"He held out then A writing, as he went; And ask'd me, when False man would be content To pay again What God and Nature lent. "
3100,38. UPON TIME.,"An hour-glass, In which were sands but few, As he did pass, He show'd, and told me, too, Mine end near was; And so away he flew. "
3102,39. HIS PETITION.,"If war or want shall make me grow so poor, As for to beg my bread from door to door; Lord! let me never act that beggar's part, Who hath Thee in his mouth, not in his heart: He who asks alms in that so sacred Name, Without due reverence, plays the cheater's game. "
3104,40. TO GOD.,"Thou hast promis'd, Lord, to be With me in my misery; Suffer me to be so bold As to speak, Lord, say and hold. "

3121,43. COCK-CROW.,"Bellman of night, if I about shall go For to deny my Master, do thou crow. Thou stop'dst St. Peter in the midst of sin; Stay me, by crowing, ere I do begin: Better it is, premonish'd for to shun A sin, than fall to weeping when 'tis done. "
3123,44. ALL THINGS RUN WELL FOR THE RIGHTEOUS.,"Adverse and prosperous fortunes both work on Here, for the righteous man's salvation; Be he oppos'd, or be he not withstood, All serve to th' augmentation of his good. "

3127,46. TO GOD.,"I'll come, I'll creep, though Thou dost threat, Humbly unto Thy mercy-seat: When I am there, this then I'll do, Give Thee a dart, and dagger too; Next, when I have my faults confessed, Naked I'll show a sighing breast; Which if that can't Thy pity woo, Then let Thy justice do the rest And strike it through. "
3129,47. A THANKSGIVING TO GOD FOR HIS HOUSE.,"Lord, Thou hast given me a cell Wherein to dwell; A little house, whose humble roof Is weather-proof; Under the spars of which I lie Both soft and dry; Where Thou my chamber for to ward Hast set a guard Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep Me, while I sleep. Low is my porch, as is my fate, Both void of state; And yet the threshold of my door Is worn by th' poor, Who thither come, and freely get Good words or meat; Like as my parlour, so my hall And kitchen's small; A little buttery, and therein A little bin Which keeps my little loaf of bread Unclipt, unflead. Some brittle sticks of thorn or briar Make me a fire, Close by whose living coal I sit, And glow like it. Lord, I confess, too, when I dine, The pulse is Thine, And all those other bits, that be There placed by Thee; The worts, the purslain, and the mess Of water-cress, Which of Thy kindness Thou hast sent; And my content Makes those, and my beloved beet, To be more sweet. 'Tis Thou that crown'st my glittering hearth With guiltless mirth; And giv'st me wassail bowls to drink, Spiced to the brink. Lord, 'tis Thy plenty-dropping hand, That soils my land; And giv'st me for my bushel sown, Twice ten for one. Thou mak'st my teeming hen to lay Her egg each day; Besides my healthful ewes to bear Me twins each year, The while the conduits of my kine Run cream for wine. All these, and better Thou dost send Me, to this end, That I should render, for my part, A thankful heart; Which, fired with incense, I resign, As wholly Thine; But the acceptance, that must be, My Christ, by Thee. "
3132,48. TO GOD.,"Make, make me Thine, my gracious God, Or with Thy staff, or with Thy rod; And be the blow, too, what it will, Lord, I will kiss it, though it kill: Beat me, bruise me, rack me, rend me, Yet, in torments, I'll commend Thee; Examine me with fire, and prove me To the full, yet I will love Thee; Nor shall Thou give so deep a wound But I as patient will be found. "
3134,49. ANOTHER TO GOD.,"Lord, do not beat me, Since I do sob and cry, And swoon away to die, Ere Thou dost threat me. Lord, do not scourge me, If I by lies and oaths Have soil'd myself or clothes, But rather purge me. "
3136,50. NONE TRULY HAPPY HERE.,"Happy's that man to whom God gives A stock of goods, whereby he lives Near to the wishes of his heart: No man is blest through every part. "
3138,51. TO HIS EVER-LOVING GOD.,"Can I not come to Thee, my God, for these So very many meeting hindrances, That slack my pace, but yet not make me stay? Who slowly goes, rids, in the end, his way. Clear Thou my paths, or shorten Thou my miles, Remove the bars, or lift me o'er the stiles; Since rough the way is, help me when I call, And take me up; or else prevent the fall. I ken my home, and it affords some ease To see far off the smoking villages. Fain would I rest, yet covet not to die For fear of future biting penury: No, no, my God, Thou know'st my wishes be To leave this life, not loving it, but Thee. "
3141,52. ANOTHER.,"Thou bid'st me come; I cannot come; for why? Thou dwell'st aloft, and I want wings to fly. To mount my soul, she must have pinions given; For 'tis no easy way from earth to heaven. "
3143,53. TO DEATH.,"Thou bid'st me come away, And I'll no longer stay Than for to shed some tears For faults of former years, And to repent some crimes Done in the present times: And next, to take a bit Of bread, and wine with it: To don my robes of love, Fit for the place above; To gird my loins about With charity throughout; And so to travel hence With feet of innocence: These done, I'll only cry God mercy, and so die. "
3145,54. NEUTRALITY LOATHSOME.,"God will have all, or none; serve Him, or fall Down before Baal, Bel, or Belial: Either be hot or cold: God doth despise, Abhor, and spew out all neutralities. "
3147,55. WELCOME WHAT COMES.,"Whatever comes, let's be content withal: Among God's blessings there is no one small. "
3149,56. TO HIS ANGRY GOD.,"Through all the night Thou dost me fright, And hold'st mine eyes from sleeping; And day by day, My cup can say My wine is mix'd with weeping. "

3152,56. TO HIS ANGRY GOD.,"Long, long, I'm sure, This can't endure, But in short time 'twill please Thee, My gentle God, To burn the rod, Or strike so as to ease me. "

3160,"59. TO HIS SAVIOUR, A CHILD: A PRESENT BY A CHILD.","Go, pretty child, and bear this flower Unto thy little Saviour; And tell Him, by that bud now blown, He is the Rose of Sharon known. When thou hast said so, stick it there Upon His bib or stomacher; And tell Him, for good handsel too, That thou hast brought a whistle new, Made of a clean strait oaten reed, To charm His cries at time of need. Tell Him, for coral, thou hast none, But if thou hadst, He should have one; But poor thou art, and known to be Even as moneyless as He. Lastly, if thou canst win a kiss From those mellifluous lips of His; Then never take a second on, To spoil the first impression. "
3163,60. THE NEW-YEAR'S GIFT.,"Let others look for pearl and gold, Tissues, or tabbies manifold: One only lock of that sweet hay Whereon the blessed baby lay, Or one poor swaddling-clout, shall be The richest New-Year's gift to me. "

3172,64. HONOURS ARE HINDRANCES.,"Give me honours! what are these, But the pleasing hindrances? Stiles, and stops, and stays that come In the way 'twixt me and home; Clear the walk, and then shall I To my heaven less run than fly. "
3174,"65. THE PARASCEVE, OR PREPARATION.","To a love-feast we both invited are: The figur'd damask, or pure diaper, Over the golden altar now is spread, With bread, and wine, and vessels furnished; The sacred towel and the holy ewer Are ready by, to make the guests all pure: Let's go, my Alma; yet, ere we receive, Fit, fit it is we have our parasceve. Who to that sweet bread unprepar'd doth come, Better be starv'd, than but to taste one crumb. "
3177,66. TO GOD.,"God gives not only corn for need, But likewise sup'rabundant seed; Bread for our service, bread for show, Meat for our meals, and fragments too: He gives not poorly, taking some Between the finger and the thumb; But for our glut and for our store, Fine flour press'd down, and running o'er. "
3179,67. A WILL TO BE WORKING.,"Although we cannot turn the fervent fit Of sin, we must strive 'gainst the stream of it; And howsoe'er we have the conquest miss'd, 'Tis for our glory that we did resist. "
3181,68. CHRIST'S PART.,"Christ, He requires still, wheresoe'er He comes To feed or lodge, to have the best of rooms: Give Him the choice; grant Him the nobler part Of all the house: the best of all's the heart. "
3183,69. RICHES AND POVERTY.,"God could have made all rich, or all men poor; But why He did not, let me tell wherefore: Had all been rich, where then had patience been? Had all been poor, who had His bounty seen? "
3185,70. SOBRIETY IN SEARCH.,"To seek of God more than we well can find, Argues a strong distemper of the mind. "
3187,71. ALMS.,"Give, if thou canst, an alms; if not, afford, Instead of that, a sweet and gentle word: _God crowns our goodness wheresoe'er He sees, On our part, wanting all abilities_. "
3189,72. TO HIS CONSCIENCE.,"Can I not sin, but thou wilt be My private protonotary? Can I not woo thee to pass by A short and sweet iniquity? I'll cast a mist and cloud upon My delicate transgression So utter dark as that no eye Shall see the hugg'd impiety; Gifts blind the wise, and bribes do please And wind all other witnesses; And wilt not thou with gold be ti'd To lay thy pen and ink aside? That in the mirk and tongueless night Wanton I may, and thou not write? It will not be. And, therefore, now, For times to come I'll make this vow, From aberrations to live free; So I'll not fear the Judge or thee. "

3197,75. HIS DREAM.,"I dreamt, last night, Thou didst transfuse Oil from Thy jar into my cruse; And pouring still Thy wealthy store, The vessel full did then run o'er; Methought I did Thy bounty chide To see the waste; but 'twas replied By Thee, dear God, God gives man seed Ofttimes for waste, as for his need. Then I could say that house is bare That has not bread and some to spare. "

3201,77. TO HIS SWEET SAVIOUR.,"Night hath no wings to him that cannot sleep, And time seems then not for to fly, but creep; Slowly her chariot drives, as if that she Had broke her wheel, or crack'd her axletree. Just so it is with me, who, list'ning, pray The winds to blow the tedious night away, That I might see the cheerful, peeping day. Sick is my heart! O Saviour! do Thou please To make my bed soft in my sicknesses: Lighten my candle, so that I beneath Sleep not for ever in the vaults of death; Let me Thy voice betimes i' th' morning hear: Call, and I'll come; say Thou the when, and where. Draw me but first, and after Thee I'll run And make no one stop till my race be done. "
3203,78. HIS CREED.,"I do believe that die I must, And be return'd from out my dust: I do believe that when I rise, Christ I shall see, with these same eyes: I do believe that I must come, With others, to the dreadful doom: I do believe the bad must go From thence, to everlasting woe: I do believe the good, and I, Shall live with Him eternally: I do believe I shall inherit Heaven, by Christ's mercies, not my merit. I do believe the One in Three, And Three in perfect unity: Lastly, that JESUS is a deed Of gift from God: and here's my creed. "

3228,84. TO GOD: ON HIS SICKNESS.,"What though my harp and viol be Both hung upon the willow tree? What though my bed be now my grave, And for my house I darkness have? What though my healthful days are fled, And I lie number'd with the dead? Yet I have hope, by Thy great power, To spring; though now a wither'd flower. "

Where shall I now begin to make, for one Least loan of Thine, half restitution? Alas! I cannot pay a jot; therefore I'll kiss the tally, and confess the score. Ten thousand talents lent me, Thou dost write; 'Tis true, my God, but I can't pay one mite. "
3304,104. TO HIS DEAR GOD.,"I'll hope no more For things that will not come; And if they do, they prove but cumbersome. Wealth brings much woe; And, since it fortunes so, 'Tis better to be poor Than so t' abound As to be drown'd Or overwhelm'd with store. "

3309,106. ON HEAVEN.,"Permit mine eyes to see Part, or the whole of Thee, O happy place! Where all have grace, And garlands shar'd, For their reward; Where each chaste soul In long white stole, And palms in hand, Do ravish'd stand; So in a ring, The praises sing Of Three in One That fill the Throne; While harps and viols then To voices say, Amen. "
3311,107. THE SUM AND THE SATISFACTION.,"Last night I drew up mine account, And found my debits to amount To such a height, as for to tell How I should pay 's impossible. Well, this I'll do: my mighty score Thy mercy-seat I'll lay before; But therewithal I'll bring the band Which, in full force, did daring stand Till my Redeemer, on the tree, Made void for millions, as for me. Then, if thou bidst me pay, or go Unto the prison, I'll say, no; Christ having paid, I nothing owe: For, this is sure, the debt is dead By law, the bond once cancelled. "
3314,108. GOOD MEN AFFLICTED MOST.,"God makes not good men wantons, but doth bring Them to the field, and, there, to skirmishing. With trials those, with terrors these He proves, And hazards those most whom the most He loves; For Sceva, darts; for Cocles, dangers; thus He finds a fire for mighty Mutius; Death for stout Cato; and besides all these, A poison, too, He has for Socrates; Torments for high Attilius; and, with want, Brings in Fabricius for a combatant: But bastard-slips, and such as He dislikes, He never brings them once to th' push of pikes.

3320,111. TO HEAVEN.,"Open thy gates To him, who weeping waits, And might come in, But that held back by sin. Let mercy be So kind to set me free, And I will straight Come in, or force the gate. "
3322,112. THE RECOMPENSE.,"All I have lost that could be rapt from me; And fare it well: yet, Herrick, if so be Thy dearest Saviour renders thee but one Smile, that one smile's full restitution. "
3324,113. TO GOD.,"Pardon me, God, once more I Thee entreat, That I have placed Thee in so mean a seat Where round about Thou seest but all things vain, Uncircumcis'd, unseason'd and profane. But as Heaven's public and immortal eye Looks on the filth, but is not soil'd thereby, So Thou, my God, may'st on this impure look, But take no tincture from my sinful book: Let but one beam of glory on it shine, And that will make me and my work divine. "
3326,114. TO GOD.,"Lord, I am like to mistletoe, Which has no root, and cannot grow Or prosper but by that same tree It clings about; so I by Thee. What need I then to fear at all, So long as I about Thee crawl? But if that tree should fall and die, Tumble shall heav'n, and down will I. "
3328,115. HIS WISH TO GOD.,"I would to God that mine old age might have Before my last, but here a living grave, Some one poor almshouse; there to lie, or stir Ghostlike, as in my meaner sepulchre; A little piggin and a pipkin by, To hold things fitting my necessity, Which rightly used, both in their time and place, Might me excite to fore and after-grace. Thy Cross, my Christ, fix'd 'fore mine eyes should be, Not to adore that, but to worship Thee. So, here the remnant of my days I'd spend, Reading Thy Bible, and my Book; so end. "
3331,116. SATAN.,"When we 'gainst Satan stoutly fight, the more He tears and tugs us than he did before; Neglecting once to cast a frown on those Whom ease makes his without the help of blows. "

3335,118. THE WAY.,"When I a ship see on the seas, Cuff'd with those wat'ry savages, And therewithal behold it hath In all that way no beaten path, Then, with a wonder, I confess Thou art our way i' th' wilderness; And while we blunder in the dark, Thou art our candle there, or spark. "
3337,"119. GREAT GRIEF, GREAT GLORY.","The less our sorrows here and suff'rings cease, The more our crowns of glory there increase. "
3339,120. HELL.,"Hell is the place where whipping-cheer abounds, But no one jailer there to wash the wounds. "
3341,121. THE BELLMAN.,"Along the dark and silent night, With my lantern and my light, And the tinkling of my bell, Thus I walk, and this I tell: Death and dreadfulness call on To the gen'ral session, To whose dismal bar we there All accounts must come to clear. Scores of sins w'ave made here many, Wip'd out few, God knows, if any. Rise, ye debtors, then, and fall To make payment while I call. Ponder this, when I am gone; By the clock 'tis almost one. "
3343,122. THE GOODNESS OF HIS GOD.,"When winds and seas do rage And threaten to undo me, Thou dost, their wrath assuage If I but call unto Thee. "
3344,122. THE GOODNESS OF HIS GOD.,"A mighty storm last night Did seek my soul to swallow, But by the peep of light A gentle calm did follow. "
3345,122. THE GOODNESS OF HIS GOD.,"What need I then despair, Though ills stand round about me; Since mischiefs neither dare To bark or bite without Thee? "

How soberly above the rest Of those that prank it with their plumes, And jet it with their choice perfumes! _Chor._ Thy vestures were not flowing: Nor did the street Accuse thy feet Of mincing in their going. "
3354,"123. THE WIDOWS' TEARS: OR, DIRGE OF DORCAS.","And though thou here li'st dead, we see A deal of beauty yet in thee. How sweetly shows thy smiling face, Thy lips with all-diffused grace!

3369,"128. THE WHITE ISLAND: OR, PLACE OF THE BLEST.","In that whiter island, where Things are evermore sincere; Candour here, and lustre there Delighting: "

3374,129. TO CHRIST.,"I crawl, I creep; my Christ, I come To Thee for curing balsamum: Thou hast, nay more, Thou art the tree Affording salve of sovereignty. My mouth I'll lay unto Thy wound Bleeding, that no blood touch the ground: For, rather than one drop shall fall To waste, my JESU, I'll take all. "
3376,130. TO GOD.,"God! to my little meal and oil Add but a bit of flesh to boil: And Thou my pipkinet shalt see, Give a wave-off'ring unto Thee. "

3388,136. KNOWLEDGE.,"Science in God is known to be A substance, not a quality. "
3390,137. SALUTATION.,"Christ, I have read, did to His chaplains say, Sending them forth, Salute no man by th' way: Not that He taught His ministers to be Unsmooth or sour to all civility, But to instruct them to avoid all snares Of tardidation in the Lord's affairs. Manners are good; but till His errand ends, Salute we must nor strangers, kin, or friends. "
3395,139. TEARS.,"God from our eyes all tears hereafter wipes, And gives His children kisses then, not stripes. "
3397,140. GOD'S BLESSING.,"In vain our labours are whatsoe'er they be, Unless God gives the benedicite. "
3399,"141. GOD, AND LORD.",God is His name of nature; but that word Implies His power when He's called the Lord. 
3401,142. THE JUDGMENT-DAY.,"God hides from man the reck'ning day, that he May fear it ever for uncertainty; That being ignorant of that one, he may Expect the coming of it every day. "
3403,143. ANGELS.,"Angels are called gods; yet of them, none Are gods but by participation: As just men are entitled gods, yet none Are gods of them but by adoption. "
3405,144. LONG LIFE.,"The longer thread of life we spin, The more occasion still to sin. "
3407,145. TEARS.,The tears of saints more sweet by far Than all the songs of sinners are.

3432,157. MONTES SCRIPTURARUM: THE MOUNTS OF THE SCRIPTURES.,"The mountains of the Scriptures are, some say, Moses, and Jesus, called Joshua: The prophets, mountains of the Old are meant, Th' apostles, mounts of the New Testament. "
3434,158. PRAYER.,"A prayer that is said alone Starves, having no companion. Great things ask for when thou dost pray, And those great are which ne'er decay. Pray not for silver, rust eats this; Ask not for gold, which metal is; Nor yet for houses, which are here But earth: _such vows ne'er reach God's ear_. "
3436,159. CHRIST'S SADNESS.,"Christ was not sad, i' th' garden, for His own Passion, but for His sheep's dispersion. "

3478,179. THE ASS.,"God did forbid the Israelites to bring An ass unto Him for an offering, Only, by this dull creature, to express His detestation to all slothfulness. "
3480,180. OBSERVATION.,"The Virgin Mother stood at distance, there, From her Son's cross, not shedding once a tear, Because the law forbad to sit and cry For those who did as malefactors die. So she, to keep her mighty woes in awe, Tortured her love not to transgress the law. Observe we may, how Mary Joses then, And th' other Mary, Mary Magdalen, Sat by the grave; and sadly sitting there, Shed for their Master many a bitter tear; But 'twas not till their dearest Lord was dead And then to weep they both were licensed. "
3482,181. TAPERS.,"Those tapers which we set upon the grave In fun'ral pomp, but this importance have: That souls departed are not put out quite; But as they walked here in their vestures white, So live in heaven in everlasting light. "

3506,193. NORTH AND SOUTH.,"The Jews their beds and offices of ease, Placed north and south for these clean purposes; That man's uncomely froth might not molest God's ways and walks, which lie still east and west. "
3508,194. SABBATHS.,"Sabbaths are threefold, as St. Austin says: The first of time, or Sabbath here of days; The second is a conscience trespass-free; The last the Sabbath of Eternity. "

3512,196. SIN.,"There is no evil that we do commit, But hath th' extraction of some good from it: As when we sin, God, the great Chemist, thence Draws out th' elixir of true penitence. "
3514,197. GOD.,"God is more here than in another place, Not by His essence, but commerce of grace. "
3516,"198. THIS, AND THE NEXT WORLD.","God hath this world for many made, 'tis true: But He hath made the World to Come for few. "
3518,199. EASE.,God gives to none so absolute an ease As not to know or feel some grievances. 
3520,200. BEGINNINGS AND ENDINGS.,"Paul, he began ill, but he ended well; Judas began well, but he foully fell: In godliness not the beginnings so Much as the ends are to be look'd unto. "
3522,201. TEMPORAL GOODS.,"These temporal goods God, the most wise, commends To th' good and bad in common for two ends: First, that these goods none here may o'er-esteem Because the wicked do partake of them; Next, that these ills none cowardly may shun, Being, oft here, the just man's portion. "

3537,208. THE RESURRECTION POSSIBLE AND PROBABLE.,"For each one body that i' th' earth is sown, There's an uprising but of one for one; But for each grain that in the ground is thrown, Threescore or fourscore spring up thence for one: So that the wonder is not half so great Of ours as is the rising of the wheat. "

3549,214. CHRIST'S ACTION.,Christ never did so great a work but there His human nature did in part appear; Or ne'er so mean a piece but men might see Therein some beams of His Divinity: So that in all He did there did combine His human nature and His part divine. 
3551,215. PREDESTINATION.,"Predestination is the cause alone Of many standing, but of fall to none. "
3553,216. ANOTHER.,"Art thou not destin'd? then with haste go on To make thy fair predestination: If thou can'st change thy life, God then will please To change, or call back, His past sentences. "
3555,217. SIN.,Sin never slew a soul unless there went Along with it some tempting blandishment. 
3557,218. ANOTHER.,"Sin is an act so free, that if we shall Say 'tis not free, 'tis then no sin at all. "
3559,219. ANOTHER.,Sin is the cause of death; and sin's alone The cause of God's predestination: And from God's prescience of man's sin doth flow Our destination to eternal woe. 
3561,220. PRESCIENCE.,God's prescience makes none sinful; but th' offence Of man's the chief cause of God's prescience. 
3563,221. CHRIST.,"To all our wounds here, whatsoe'er they be, Christ is the one sufficient remedy. "
3565,222. CHRIST'S INCARNATION.,"Christ took our nature on Him, not that He 'Bove all things loved it for the purity: No, but He dress'd Him with our human trim, Because our flesh stood most in need of Him. "
3567,223. HEAVEN.,Heaven is not given for our good works here; Yet it is given to the labourer. 
3569,224. GOD'S KEYS,"God has four keys, which He reserves alone: The first of rain; the key of hell next known; With the third key He opes and shuts the womb; And with the fourth key he unlocks the tomb. "

3575,227. HELL FIRE.,"One only fire has hell; but yet it shall Not after one sort there excruciate all: But look, how each transgressor onward went Boldly in sin, shall feel more punishment. "
3577,228. TO KEEP A TRUE LENT.,"Is this a fast, to keep The larder lean? And clean From fat of veals and sheep? "
3578,228. TO KEEP A TRUE LENT.,"Is it to quit the dish Of flesh, yet still To fill The platter high with fish? "
3579,228. TO KEEP A TRUE LENT.,"Is it to fast an hour, Or ragg'd to go, Or show A downcast look and sour? "
3580,228. TO KEEP A TRUE LENT.,"No; 'tis a fast to dole Thy sheaf of wheat, And meat, Unto the hungry soul. "
3581,228. TO KEEP A TRUE LENT.,"It is to fast from strife, From old debate And hate; To circumcise thy life. "
3582,228. TO KEEP A TRUE LENT.,"To show a heart grief-rent; To starve thy sin, Not bin; And that's to keep thy Lent. "
3584,229. NO TIME IN ETERNITY.,"By hours we all live here; in Heaven is known No spring of time, or time's succession. "
3586,230. HIS MEDITATION UPON DEATH.,"Be those few hours, which I have yet to spend, Blest with the meditation of my end: Though they be few in number, I'm content: If otherwise, I stand indifferent. Nor makes it matter Nestor's years to tell, If man lives long and if he live not well. A multitude of days still heaped on, Seldom brings order, but confusion. Might I make choice, long life should be withstood; Nor would I care how short it were, if good: Which to effect, let ev'ry passing-bell Possess my thoughts, ""Next comes my doleful knell"": And when the night persuades me to my bed, I'll think I'm going to be buried. So shall the blankets which come over me Present those turfs which once must cover me: And with as firm behaviour I will meet The sheet I sleep in as my winding-sheet. When sleep shall bathe his body in mine eyes, I will believe that then my body dies: And if I chance to wake and rise thereon, I'll have in mind my resurrection, Which must produce me to that General Doom, To which the peasant, so the prince, must come, To hear the Judge give sentence on the throne, Without the least hope of affection. Tears, at that day, shall make but weak defence, When hell and horror fright the conscience. Let me, though late, yet at the last, begin To shun the least temptation to a sin; Though to be tempted be no sin, until Man to th' alluring object gives his will. Such let my life assure me, when my breath Goes thieving from me, I am safe in death; Which is the height of comfort: when I fall, I rise triumphant in my funeral. "
3589,231. CLOTHES FOR CONTINUANCE.,"Those garments lasting evermore, Are works of mercy to the poor, Which neither tettar, time, or moth Shall fray that silk or fret this cloth. "
3592,232. TO GOD.,"Come to me, God; but do not come To me as to the General Doom In power; or come Thou in that state When Thou Thy laws did'st promulgate, Whenas the mountain quaked for dread, And sullen clouds bound up his head. No; lay Thy stately terrors by To talk with me familiarly; For if Thy thunder-claps I hear, I shall less swoon than die for fear. Speak Thou of love and I'll reply By way of Epithalamy, Or sing of mercy and I'll suit To it my viol and my lute; Thus let Thy lips but love distil, Then come, my God, and hap what will. "
3595,233. THE SOUL.,"When once the soul has lost her way, O then how restless does she stray! And having not her God for light, How does she err in endless night! "
3597,234. THE JUDGMENT-DAY.,"In doing justice God shall then be known, Who showing mercy here, few prized, or none. "
3599,235. SUFFERINGS.,"We merit all we suffer, and by far More stripes than God lays on the sufferer. "
3601,236. PAIN AND PLEASURE.,"God suffers not His saints and servants dear To have continual pain or pleasure here; But look how night succeeds the day, so He Gives them by turns their grief and jollity. "
3603,237. GOD'S PRESENCE.,"God is all-present to whate'er we do, And as all-present, so all-filling too. "

3607,239. THE POOR MAN'S PART.,"Tell me, rich man, for what intent Thou load'st with gold thy vestiment? Whenas the poor cry out: To us Belongs all gold superfluous. "
3609,240. THE RIGHT HAND.,"God has a right hand, but is quite bereft Of that which we do nominate the left. "
3611,241. THE STAFF AND ROD.,"Two instruments belong unto our God: The one a staff is and the next a rod; That if the twig should chance too much to smart, The staff might come to play the friendly part. "
3613,242. GOD SPARING IN SCOURGING.,"God still rewards us more than our desert; But when He strikes, He quarter-acts His part. "
3615,243. CONFESSION.,"Confession twofold is, as Austin says, The first of sin is, and the next of praise. If ill it goes with thee, thy faults confess: If well, then chant God's praise with cheerfulness. "
3617,244. GOD'S DESCENT.,"God is then said for to descend, when He Doth here on earth some thing of novity; As when in human nature He works more Than ever yet the like was done before. "
3619,245. NO COMING TO GOD WITHOUT CHRIST.,"Good and great God! how should I fear To come to Thee if Christ not there! Could I but think He would not be Present to plead my cause for me, To hell I'd rather run than I Would see Thy face and He not by. "
3621,246. ANOTHER TO GOD.,Though Thou be'st all that active love Which heats those ravished souls above; And though all joys spring from the glance Of Thy most winning countenance; Yet sour and grim Thou'dst seem to me If through my Christ I saw not Thee. 
3623,247. THE RESURRECTION.,"That Christ did die, the pagan saith; But that He rose, that's Christians' faith. "
3625,248. CO-HEIRS.,We are co-heirs with Christ; nor shall His own Heirship be less by our adoption. The number here of heirs shall from the state Of His great birthright nothing derogate. 
3627,249. THE NUMBER OF TWO.,"God hates the dual number, being known The luckless number of division; And when He bless'd each sev'ral day whereon He did His curious operation, 'Tis never read there, as the fathers say, God bless'd His work done on the second day; Wherefore two prayers ought not to be said, Or by ourselves, or from the pulpit read. "
3629,250. HARDENING OF HEARTS.,"God's said our hearts to harden then, Whenas His grace not supples men. "
3631,251. THE ROSE.,"Before man's fall the rose was born, St. Ambrose says, without the thorn; But for man's fault then was the thorn Without the fragrant rose-bud born; But ne'er the rose without the thorn. "
3633,252. GOD'S TIME MUST END OUR TROUBLE.,"God doth not promise here to man that He Will free him quickly from his misery; But in His own time, and when He thinks fit, Then He will give a happy end to it. "
3635,253. BAPTISM.,"The strength of baptism that's within, It saves the soul by drowning sin. "
3637,254. GOLD AND FRANKINCENSE.,"Gold serves for tribute to the king, The frankincense for God's off'ring. "
3639,255. TO GOD.,"God, who me gives a will for to repent, Will add a power to keep me innocent; That I shall ne'er that trespass recommit When I have done true penance here for it. "
3641,256. THE CHEWING THE CUD.,"When well we speak and nothing do that's good, We not divide the hoof, but chew the cud; But when good words by good works have their proof, We then both chew the cud and cleave the hoof. "
3643,257. CHRIST'S TWOFOLD COMING.,"Thy former coming was to cure My soul's most desp'rate calenture; Thy second advent, that must be To heal my earth's infirmity. "
3646,"258. TO GOD, HIS GIFT.","As my little pot doth boil, We will keep this level-coil, That a wave and I will bring To my God a heave-offering. "
3647,"258. TO GOD, HIS GIFT.","_Level-coil_, the old Christmas game of changing chairs; to ""keep level-coil"" means to change about. "
3649,259. GOD'S ANGER.,"God can't be wrathful: but we may conclude Wrathful He may be by similitude: God's wrathful said to be, when He doth do That without wrath which wrath doth force us to. "
3651,260. GOD'S COMMANDS.,In God's commands ne'er ask the reason why; Let thy obedience be the best reply. 
3653,261. TO GOD.,"If I have played the truant, or have here Failed in my part, oh! Thou that art my dear, My mild, my loving tutor, Lord and God! Correct my errors gently with Thy rod. I know that faults will many here be found, But where sin swells there let Thy grace abound. "
3655,262. TO GOD.,"The work is done; now let my laurel be Given by none but by Thyself to me: That done, with honour Thou dost me create Thy poet, and Thy prophet Laureate. "

3657,"263. GOOD FRIDAY: REX TRAGICUS; OR, CHRIST GOING TO HIS CROSS.","Put off Thy robe of purple, then go on To the sad place of execution: Thine hour is come, and the tormentor stands Ready to pierce Thy tender feet and hands. Long before this, the base, the dull, the rude, Th' inconstant and unpurged multitude Yawn for Thy coming; some ere this time cry, How He defers, how loath He is to die! Amongst this scum, the soldier with his spear And that sour fellow with his vinegar, His sponge, and stick, do ask why Thou dost stay; So do the scurf and bran too. Go Thy way, Thy way, Thou guiltless man, and satisfy By Thine approach each their beholding eye. Not as a thief shalt Thou ascend the mount, But like a person of some high account; The Cross shall be Thy stage, and Thou shalt there The spacious field have for Thy theatre. Thou art that Roscius and that marked-out man That must this day act the tragedian To wonder and affrightment: Thou art He Whom all the flux of nations comes to see, Not those poor thieves that act their parts with Thee; Those act without regard, when once a king And God, as Thou art, comes to suffering. No, no; this scene from Thee takes life, and sense, And soul, and spirit, plot and excellence. Why then, begin, great King! ascend Thy throne, And thence proceed to act Thy Passion To such an height, to such a period raised, As hell, and earth, and heav'n may stand amazed. God and good angels guide Thee; and so bless Thee in Thy several parts of bitterness, That those who see Thee nail'd unto the tree May, though they scorn Thee, praise and pity Thee. And we, Thy lovers, while we see Thee keep The laws of action, will both sigh and weep, And bring our spices to embalm Thee dead; That done, we'll see Thee sweetly buried. "
3660,264. HIS WORDS TO CHRIST GOING TO THE CROSS.,"When Thou wast taken, Lord, I oft have read, All Thy disciples Thee forsook and fled. Let their example not a pattern be For me to fly, but now to follow Thee. "
3662,265. ANOTHER TO HIS SAVIOUR.,"If Thou be'st taken, God forbid I fly from Thee, as others did: But if Thou wilt so honour me As to accept my company, I'll follow Thee, hap hap what shall, Both to the judge and judgment hall: And, if I see Thee posted there, To be all-flayed with whipping-cheer, I'll take my share; or else, my God, Thy stripes I'll kiss, or burn the rod. "
3664,266. HIS SAVIOUR'S WORDS GOING TO THE CROSS.,"Have, have ye no regard, all ye Who pass this way, to pity Me, Who am a man of misery! "

3670,267. HIS ANTHEM TO CHRIST ON THE CROSS.,"When I behold Thee, almost slain, With one and all parts full of pain: When I Thy gentle heart do see Pierced through and dropping blood for me, I'll call, and cry out, thanks to Thee. "
3671,267. HIS ANTHEM TO CHRIST ON THE CROSS.,"_Vers._ But yet it wounds my soul to think That for my sin Thou, Thou must drink, Even Thou alone, the bitter cup Of fury and of vengeance up. "

3675,267. HIS ANTHEM TO CHRIST ON THE CROSS.,"This   crosstree   here Doth    Jesus     bear, Who   sweet'ned   first The   death   accurs'd. Here all things ready are, make haste, make haste away; For long this  work will be,  and very short  this day. Why then,  go on to  act:  here's  wonders to be  done Before the last  least sand of  Thy ninth  hour be run; Or ere dark  clouds do dull  or dead the mid-day's sun. Act  when   Thou  wilt, Blood  will  be  spilt; Pure  balm, that  shall Bring  health  to  all. Why     then,     begin To    pour   first   in Some   drops  of  wine, Instead    of    brine, To   search  the  wound So     long    unsound: And,  when that's done, Let    oil   next   run To   cure   the    sore Sin     made    before. And   O!  dear  Christ, E'en   as  Thou  di'st, Look   down,  and   see Us   weep   for   Thee. And  tho', love  knows, Thy    dreadful    woes We     cannot     ease, Yet  do   Thou  please, Who     mercy      art, T'  accept  each  heart That    gladly    would Help   if   it   could. Meanwhile   let     me, Beneath   this    tree, This    honour    have, To   make   my   grave. "
3677,269. TO HIS SAVIOUR'S SEPULCHRE: HIS DEVOTION.,"Hail, holy and all-honour'd tomb, By no ill haunted; here I come, With shoes put off, to tread thy room. I'll not profane by soil of sin Thy door as I do enter in; For I have washed both hand and heart, This, that, and every other part, So that I dare, with far less fear Than full affection, enter here. Thus, thus I come to kiss Thy stone With a warm lip and solemn one: And as I kiss I'll here and there Dress Thee with flow'ry diaper. How sweet this place is! as from hence Flowed all Panchaia's frankincense; Or rich Arabia did commix, Here, all her rare aromatics. Let me live ever here, and stir No one step from this sepulchre. Ravish'd I am! and down I lie Confused in this brave ecstasy. Here let me rest; and let me have This for my heaven that was Thy grave: And, coveting no higher sphere, I'll my eternity spend here. "

3682,271. HIS COMING TO THE SEPULCHRE.,"Hence they have borne my Lord; behold! the stone Is rolled away and my sweet Saviour's gone. Tell me, white angel, what is now become Of Him we lately sealed up in this tomb? Is He, from hence, gone to the shades beneath, To vanquish hell as here He conquered death? If so, I'll thither follow without fear, And live in hell if that my Christ stays there. "

3687,THE DESCRIPTION OF A WOMAN.,"Whose head, befringed with bescattered tresses, Shows like Apollo's when the morn he dresses,[B] Or like Aurora when with pearl she sets Her long, dishevell'd, rose-crown'd trammelets: Her forehead smooth, full, polish'd, bright and high Bears in itself a graceful majesty, Under the which two crawling eyebrows twine Like to the tendrils of a flatt'ring vine, Under whose shade two starry sparkling eyes Are beautifi'd with fair fring'd canopies. Her comely nose, with uniformal grace, Like purest white, stands in the middle place, Parting the pair, as we may well suppose. Each cheek resembling still a damask rose, Which like a garden manifestly show How roses, lilies, and carnations grow, Which sweetly mixed both with white and red, Like rose leaves, white and red, seem[C] mingled. Then nature for a sweet allurement sets Two smelling, swelling, bashful cherrylets, The which with ruby redness being tipp'd, Do speak a virgin, merry, cherry-lipp'd. Over the which a neat, sweet skin is drawn, Which makes them show like roses under lawn: These be the ruby portals, and divine, Which ope themselves to show a holy shrine Whose breath is rich perfume, that to the sense Smells like the burn'd Sabean frankincense: In which the tongue, though but a member small, Stands guarded with a rosy-hilly wall; And her white teeth, which in the gums are set Like pearl and gold, make one rich cabinet. Next doth her chin with dimpled beauty strive For his white, plump, and smooth prerogative; At whose fair top, to please the sight, there grows The fairest[D] image of a blushing rose, Mov'd by the chin, whose motion causeth this, That both her lips do part, do meet, do kiss; Her ears, which like two labyrinths are plac'd On either side, with rich rare jewels grac'd, Moving a question whether that by them The gem is grac'd, or they grac'd by the gem. But the foundation of the architect Is the swan-staining, fair, rare, stately neck Which with ambitious humbleness stands under, Bearing aloft this rich, round world of wonder. Her breast, a place for beauty's throne most fit, Bears up two globes where love and pleasure sit, Which, headed with two rich, round rubies, show Like wanton rosebuds growing out of snow; And in the milky valley that's between Sits Cupid, kissing of his mother queen, Fingering the paps that feel like sieved silk, And press'd a little they will weep pure milk. Then comes the belly, seated next below, Like a fair mountain in Riphean snow, Where Nature, in a whiteness without spot, Hath in the middle tied a Gordian knot. Now love invites me to survey her thighs, Swelling in likeness like two crystal skies, Which to the knees by Nature fastened on, Derive their ever well 'greed motion. Her legs with two clear calves, like silver tri'd, Kindly swell up with little pretty pride, Leaving a distance for the comely[E] small To beautify the leg and foot withal. Then lowly, yet most lovely stand the feet, Round, short and clear, like pounded spices sweet, And whatsoever thing they tread upon They make it scent like bruised cinnamon. The lovely shoulders now allure the eye To see two tablets of pure ivory From which two arms like branches seem to spread With tender rind[F] and silver coloured, With little hands and fingers long and small To grace a lute, a viol, virginal. In length each finger doth his next excel, Each richly headed with a pearly shell. Thus every part in contrariety Meet in the whole and make a harmony, As divers strings do singly disagree, But form'd by number make sweet melody. "
3694,MR. HERRICK: HIS DAUGHTER'S DOWRY.,"Ere I go hence and be no more Seen to the world, I'll give the score I owe unto a female child, And that is this, a verse enstyled My daughter's dowry; having which, I'll leave thee then completely rich. Instead of gold, pearl, rubies, bonds Long forfeit, pawned diamonds Or antique pledges, house or land, I give thee this that shall withstand The blow of ruin and of chance. These hurt not thine inheritance, For 'tis fee simple and no rent Thou fortune ow'st for tenement. However after times will praise, This portion, my prophetic bays, Cannot deliver up to th' rust, Yet I keep peaceful in my dust. As for thy birth and better seeds (Those which must grow to virtuous deeds), Thou didst derive from that old stem (Love and mercy cherish them), Which like a vestal virgin ply With holy fire lest that it die. Grow up with milder laws to know At what time to say aye or no; Let manners teach thee where to be More comely flowing, where less free. These bring thy husband, like to those Old coins and medals we expose To th' show, but never part with. Next, As in a more conspicuous text, Thy forehead, let therein be sign'd The maiden candour of thy mind; And under it two chaste-born spies To bar out bold adulteries, For through these optics fly the darts Of lust which set on fire our hearts. On either side of these quick ears There must be plac'd, for seasoned fears Which sweeten love, yet ne'er come nigh The plague of wilder jealousy. Then let each cheek of thine entice His soul as to a bed of spice Where he may roll and lose his sense, As in a bed of frankincense. A lip enkindled with that coal With which love chafes and warms the soul, Bring to him next, and in it show Love's cherries from such fires grow And have their harvest, which must stand The gathering of the lip, not hand; Then unto these be it thy care To clothe thy words in gentle air, That smooth as oil, sweet, soft and clean As is the childish bloom of bean, They may fall down and stroke, as the Beams of the sun the peaceful sea. With hands as smooth as mercy's bring Him for his better cherishing, That when thou dost his neck ensnare, Or with thy wrist, or flattering hair, He may, a prisoner, there descry Bondage more loved than liberty. A nature so well formed, so wrought To calm and tempest, let be brought With thee, that should he but incline To roughness, clasp him like a vine, Or like as wool meets steel, give way Unto the passion, not to stay; Wrath, if resisted, over-boils, If not, it dies or else recoils. And lastly, see you bring to him Somewhat peculiar to each limb; And I charge thee to be known By n'other face but by thine own. Let it in love's name be kept sleek, Yet to be found when he shall seek It, and not instead of saint Give up his worth unto the paint; For, trust me, girl, she over-does Who by a double proxy woos. But lest I should forget his bed, Be sure thou bring a maidenhead. That is a margarite, which lost, Thou bring'st unto his bed a frost Or a cold poison, which his blood Benumbs like the forgetful flood. Now for some jewels to supply The want of earrings' bravery For public eyes; take only these Ne'er travelled for beyond the seas; They're nobly home-bred, yet have price Beyond the far-fet merchandise: Obedience, wise distrust, peace, shy Distance and sweet urbanity; Safe modesty, lov'd patience, fear Of offending, temperance, dear Constancy, bashfulness and all The virtues less or cardinal, Take with my blessing, and go forth Enjewelled with thy native worth. And now if there a man be found That looks for such prepared ground, Let him, but with indifferent skill, So good a soil bestock and till; He may ere long have such a wife Nourish in's breast a tree of life. "
3696,MR. ROBERT HERRICK: HIS FAREWELL UNTO POETRY.,"I have beheld two lovers in a night Hatched o'er with moonshine from their stolen delight (When this to that, and that to this, had given A kiss to such a jewel of the heaven, Or while that each from other's breath did drink Health to the rose, the violet, or pink), Call'd on the sudden by the jealous mother, Some stricter mistress or suspicious other, Urging divorcement (worse than death to these) By the soon jingling of some sleepy keys, Part with a hasty kiss; and in that show How stay they would, yet forced they are to go. Even such are we, and in our parting do No otherwise than as those former two Natures like ours, we who have spent our time Both from the morning to the evening chime. Nay, till the bellman of the night had tolled Past noon of night, yet wear the hours not old Nor dulled with iron sleep, but have outworn The fresh and fairest nourish of the morn With flame and rapture; drinking to the odd Number of nine which makes us full with God, And in that mystic frenzy we have hurled, As with a tempest, nature through the world, And in a whirlwind twirl'd her home, aghast At that which in her ecstasy had past; Thus crowned with rosebuds, sack, thou mad'st me fly Like fire-drakes, yet didst me no harm thereby. O thou almighty nature, who didst give True heat wherewith humanity doth live Beyond its stinted circle, giving food, White fame and resurrection to the good; Shoring them up 'bove ruin till the doom, The general April of the world doth come That makes all equal. Many thousands should, Were't not for thee, have crumbled into mould, And with their serecloths rotted, not to show Whether the world such spirits had or no, Whereas by thee those and a million since, Nor fate, nor envy, can their fames convince. Homer, Musæus, Ovid, Maro, more Of those godful prophets long before Held their eternal fires, and ours of late (Thy mercy helping) shall resist strong fate, Nor stoop to the centre, but survive as long As fame or rumour hath or trump or tongue; But unto me be only hoarse, since now (Heaven and my soul bear record of my vow) I my desires screw from thee, and direct Them and my thoughts to that sublim'd respect And conscience unto priesthood; 'tis not need (The scarecrow unto mankind) that doth breed Wiser conclusions in me, since I know I've more to bear my charge than way to go, Or had I not, I'd stop the spreading itch Of craving more, so in conceit be rich; But 'tis the God of Nature who intends And shapes my function for more glorious ends. Kiss, so depart, yet stay a while to see The lines of sorrow that lie drawn in me In speech, in picture; no otherwise than when, Judgment and death denounced 'gainst guilty men, Each takes a weeping farewell, racked in mind With joys before and pleasures left behind; Shaking the head, whilst each to each doth mourn, With thought they go whence they must ne'er return. So with like looks, as once the ministrel Cast, leading his Eurydice through hell, I strike thy love, and greedily pursue Thee with mine eyes or in or out of view. So looked the Grecian orator when sent From's native country into banishment, Throwing his eyeballs backward to survey The smoke of his beloved Attica; So Tully looked when from the breasts of Rome The sad soul went, not with his love, but doom, Shooting his eyedarts 'gainst it to surprise It, or to draw the city to his eyes. Such is my parting with thee, and to prove There was not varnish only in my love, But substance, lo! receive this pearly tear Frozen with grief and place it in thine ear. Then part in name of peace, and softly on With numerous feet to hoofy Helicon; And when thou art upon that forked hill Amongst the thrice three sacred virgins, fill A full-brimm'd bowl of fury and of rage, And quaff it to the prophets of our age; When drunk with rapture curse the blind and lame, Base ballad-mongers who usurp thy name And foul thy altar; charm some into frogs, Some to be rats, and others to be hogs; Into the loathsom'st shapes thou canst devise To make fools hate them, only by disguise; Thus with a kiss of warmth and love I part Not so, but that some relic in my heart Shall stand for ever, though I do address Chiefly myself to what I must profess. Know yet, rare soul, when my diviner muse Shall want a handmaid (as she oft will use), Be ready, thou for me, to wait upon her, Though as a servant, yet a maid of honour. The crown of duty is our duty: well Doing's the fruit of doing well. Farewell. "
3698,GIFT.,"A CAROL PRESENTED TO DR. WILLIAMS, BISHOP OF LINCOLN AS A NEW-YEAR'S GIFT. "
3699,GIFT.,"Fly hence, pale care, no more remember Past sorrows with the fled December, But let each pleasant cheek appear Smooth as the childhood of the year, And sing a carol here. 'Twas brave, 'twas brave, could we command the hand Of youth's swift watch to stand As you have done your day; Then should we not decay. But all we wither, and our light Is spilt in everlasting night, Whenas your sight Shows like the heavens above the moon, Like an eternal noon That sees no setting sun. "
3700,GIFT.,"Keep up those flames, and though you shroud Awhile your forehead in a cloud, Do it like the sun to write In the air a greater text of light; Welcome to all our vows, And since you pay To us this day So long desir'd, See we have fir'd Our holy spikenard, and there's none But brings his stick of cinnamon, His eager eye or smoother smile, And lays it gently on the pile, Which thus enkindled, we invoke Your name amidst the sacred smoke. "
3701,GIFT.,"_Chorus._ Come then, great Lord. And see our altar burn With love of your return, And not a man here but consumes His soul to glad you in perfumes. "
3703,SONG. HIS MISTRESS TO HIM AT HIS FAREWELL.,"You may vow I'll not forget To pay the debt Which to thy memory stands as due As faith can seal it you; Take then tribute of my tears, So long as I have fears To prompt me I shall ever Languish and look, but thy return see never. Oh then to lessen my despair Print thy lips into the air, So by this Means I may kiss thy kiss Whenas some kind Wind Shall hither waft it, and in lieu My lips shall send a 1000 back to you. "
3705,UPON PARTING.,"Go hence away, and in thy parting know 'Tis not my voice but Heaven's that bids thee go; Spring hence thy faith, nor think it ill desert I find in thee that makes me thus to part. But voice of fame, and voice of Heaven have thundered We both were lost, if both of us not sundered. Fold now thine arms, and in thy last look rear One sigh of love, and cool it with a tear. Since part we must, let's kiss; that done, retire With as cold frost as erst we met with fire; With such white vows as fate can ne'er dissever, But truth knit fast; and so, farewell for ever. "
3707,UPON MASTER FLETCHER'S INCOMPARABLE PLAYS.,"Apollo sings, his harp resounds: give room, For now behold the golden pomp is come, Thy pomp of plays which thousands come to see With admiration both of them and thee. O volume! worthy, leaf by leaf and cover, To be with juice of cedar wash'd all over; Here words with lines and lines with scenes consent To raise an act to full astonishment; Here melting numbers, words of power to move Young men to swoon and maids to die for love. _Love lies a-bleeding_ here, _Evadne_, there Swells with brave rage, yet comely everywhere; Here's _A mad lover_, there that high design Of _King and no King_, and the rare plot thine. So that whene'er we circumvolve our eyes, Such rich, such fresh, such sweet varieties Ravish our spirits, that entranc'd we see None writes love's passion in the world like thee. "
3713,CHARON AND EUCOSMIA.,"_Euc._ Charon, O Charon, draw thy boat to th' shore, And to thy many take in one soul more. _Cha._ Who calls? who calls? _Euc._ One overwhelm'd with ruth; Have pity either on my tears or youth, And take me in who am in deep distress; But first cast off thy wonted churlishness. _Cha._ I will be gentle as that air which yields A breath of balm along the Elysian fields. Speak, what art thou? _Euc_. One once that had a lover, Than which thyself ne'er wafted sweeter over. He was---- _Cha._ Say what? _Euc._ Ah me, my woes are deep. _Cha._ Prithee relate, while I give ear and weep. _Euc._ He was a Hastings; and that one name has In it all good that is, and ever was. He was my life, my love, my joy, but died Some hours before I should have been his bride. _Chorus._ Thus, thus the gods celestial still decree, For human joy contingent misery. _Euc._ The hallowed tapers all prepared were, And Hymen call'd to bless the rites. _Cha._ Stop there. _Euc._ Great are my woes. _Cha._ And great must that grief be That makes grim Charon thus to pity thee. But now come in. _Euc._ More let me yet relate. _Cha._ I cannot stay; more souls for waftage wait And I must hence. _Euc._ Yet let me thus much know, Departing hence, where good and bad souls go? _Cha._ Those souls which ne'er were drench'd in pleasure's stream, The fields of Pluto are reserv'd for them; Where, dress'd with garlands, there they walk the ground Whose blessed youth with endless flowers is crown'd. But such as have been drown'd in this wild sea, For those is kept the Gulf of Hecate, Where with their own contagion they are fed, And there do punish and are punished. This known, the rest of thy sad story tell When on the flood that nine times circles hell. _Chorus._ We sail along to visit mortals never; But there to live where love shall last for ever. "

3758,NOTES.,"665. _Let her Lucrece all day be._ From Martial XI. civ. 21, 22:-- "
3760,NOTES.,"_Neither will Famish me, nor overfill._ Mart. I. lviii. 4: Nec volo quod cruciat, nec volo quod satiat. "
3761,NOTES.,"667. _Be't for my Bridal or my Burial._ Cp. Brand, vol. ii., and Coles' _Introduction to the Knowledge of Plants_: ""Rosemary and bayes are used by the commons both at funerals and weddings"". "
3762,NOTES.,"672. _Kings ought to be more lov'd than fear'd._ Seneca, _Octavia_, 459: Decet timeri Cæsarem. At plus diligi. "
3763,NOTES.,"673. _To Mr. Denham, on his prospective poem._ Sir John Denham published in 1642 his _Cooper's Hill_, a poem on the view over the Thames towards London, from a hill near Windsor. "
3764,NOTES.,"675. _Their fashion is, but to say no_, etc. Cp. Montaigne's _Essais_, II. 3, p. 51; Florio's tr. p. 207: ""Let it suffice that in doing it they say no and take it"". "
3765,NOTES.,"676. _Love is maintained by wealth._ Ovid, _Rem. Am._ 746: Divitiis alitur luxuriosus amor. "
3766,NOTES.,"679. _Nero commanded, but withdrew his eyes._ Tacit. _Agric._ 45: Nero subtraxit oculos, jussitque scelera, non spectavit. "
3767,NOTES.,683. _But a just measure both of Heat and Cold._ This is a version of the medieval doctrine of the four humours. So Chaucer says of his Doctor of Physic:-- 
3768,NOTES.,"""He knew the cause of every maladye, Were it of hoot or cold, or moyste, or drye, And where engendered and of what humour"". "
3769,NOTES.,"684. _'Gainst thou go'st a-mothering._ The Epistle for Mid-Lent Sunday was from Galat. iv. 21, etc., and contained the words: ""Jerusalem, quæ est Mater nostra"". On that Sunday people made offerings at their Mother Church. After the Reformation the natural mother was substituted for the spiritual, and the day was set apart for visiting relations. Excellent simnel cakes (Low Lat., _siminellus_, fine flour) are still made in the North, where the current derivation of the word is from _Sim_ and _Nell_! "
3770,NOTES.,"685. _To the King._ Probably written in 1645, when Charles was for a short time in the West. "
3771,NOTES.,"689. _Too much she gives to some, enough to none._ Mart. XII. x.; Fortuna multis dat nimis, satis nulli. "
3772,NOTES.,"696. _Men mind no state in sickness._ There is a general resemblance in this poem to the latter part of Hor. III. _Od._ i., but I have an uneasy sense that Herrick is translating. "
3775,NOTES.,"706. _How roses came red._ Cp. Burton, _Anat. Mel._ III. ii. 3: ""Constantine (_Agricult._ xi. 18) makes Cupid himself to be a great dancer: by the same token that he was capering among the gods, he flung down a bowl of nectar, which, distilling upon the white rose, ever since made it red"". "
3776,NOTES.,"709. _Tears and Laughter._ Bishop Jebb quotes a Latin couplet inscribed on an old inn at Four Crosses, Staffordshire:-- "
3777,NOTES.,"Fleres si scires unum tua tempora mensem: Rides, cum non sit forsitan una dies. "
3778,NOTES.,"710. _Tully says._ Cic. _Tusc. Disp._ III. ii. 3: Gloria est frequens de aliquo, fama cum laude. "
3779,NOTES.,"713. _His return to London._ Written at the same time as his _Farewell to Dean Bourn_, _i.e._, after his ejection in 1648, the year of the publication of the _Hesperides_. "
3780,NOTES.,"715. _No pack like poverty._ Burton, _Anat. Mel._ iii. 3: Οὐδὲν πενίας βαρύτερόν ἐστι φόρτιον. ""No burden, saith Menander, is so intolerable as poverty."" "

3783,NOTES.,"""And though they sweep their hearths no less Than maids were wont to do, Yet who of late for cleanliness Finds sixpence in her shoe?"" "
3784,NOTES.,"725. _Times that are ill ... Clouds will not ever_, etc., two reminiscences of Horace, II. _Od._ x. 17, and ix. "
3785,NOTES.,"727. _Up tails all._ This tune will be found in Chappell's _Popular Music of the Olden Time_, vol. i. p. 196. He notes that it was a favourite with Herrick, who wrote four other poems in the metre, viz.: _The Hag is Astride_, _The Maypole is up_, _The Peter-penny_, and _Twelfth Night: or, King and Queen_. The tune is found in Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book, and in the _Dancing Master_ (1650-1690). It is alluded to by Ben Jonson, and was a favourite with the Cavaliers. "
3786,NOTES.,"730. _Charon and Philomel._ This dialogue is found with some slight variations of text in Rawlinson's MS. poet. 65. fol. 32. The following variants may be noted: l. 5, _voice_ for _sound_; l. 7, _shade_ for _bird_; l. 11, _warbling_ for _watching_; l. 12, _hoist up_ for _thus hoist_; l. 13, _be gone_ for _return_; l. 18, _praise_ for _pray_; l. 19, _sighs_ for _vows_; l. 24, omit _slothful_. The dialogue is succeeded in the MS. by an old catch (probably written before Herrick was born):-- "
3787,NOTES.,"""A boat! a boat! haste to the ferry! For we go over to be merry, To laugh and quaff, and drink old sherry"". "
3788,NOTES.,"After the catch comes the following dialogue, written (it would seem) in imitation of Herrick's _Charon and Philomel_: the speakers' names are not marked:-- "
3789,NOTES.,"""Charon! O Charon! the wafter of all souls to bliss or bane! Who calls the ferryman of Hell? Come near and say who lives in bliss and who in pain. Those that die well eternal bliss shall follow. Those that die ill their own black deeds shall swallow. Shall thy black barge those guilty spirits row That kill themselves for love? Oh, no! oh, no! My cordage cracks when such foul sins draw near, No wind blows fair, nor I my boat can steer. What spirits pass and in Elysium reign? Those harmless souls that love and are beloved again. That soul that lives in love and fain would die to win, Shall he go free? Oh, no! it is too foul a sin. He must not come aboard, I dare not row, Storms of despair my boat will overblow. But when thy mistress (?) shall close up thine eyes then come aboard, Then come aboard and pass; till then be wise and sing."" "
3790,NOTES.,"""Then come aboard"" from the penultimate line and ""and sing"" from the last should clearly be struck out. "
3791,NOTES.,"739. _O Jupiter_, etc. Eubulus in Athenaeus, xiii. 559: Ὠ Ζεῦ πολυτίμητ', εἶτ' ἐγὼ κακῶς ποτε | ἐρῶ γυναῖκας; νὴ Δί' ἀπολοίμην ἄρα· | πάντων ἄριστον κτημάτων. Comp. 885. "

Created Baron Berkeley of Stratton, in Cornwall, 1658; died 1678. "
3794,NOTES.,"749. _Consultation._ As noted in the text, this is from Sallust, _Cat._ i. "
3795,NOTES.,"751. _None sees the fardell of his faults behind._ Cp. Catullus, xxii. 20, 21:-- "
3796,NOTES.,"Suus cuique attributus est error, Sed non videmus manticae quod in tergo est, "
3797,NOTES.,"or, perhaps more probably from Seneca, _de Irá_, ii. 28: Aliena vitia in oculis habemus; à tergo nostra sunt. "

3800,NOTES.,"761. _The Wake._ Printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, under the title: _Alvar and Anthea_. "
3801,NOTES.,"763. _To Doctor Alabaster._ William Alabaster, or Alablaster, born at Hadleigh, Suffolk (1567); educated at Westminster and Trinity College, Cambridge; a friend of Spencer; was converted to Roman Catholicism while chaplain to the Earl of Essex in Spain, 1596. In 1607 he began his series of apocalyptic writings by an _Apparatus in Revelationem Jesu Christi_. On visiting Rome he was imprisoned by the Inquisition, escaped, and returned to Protestantism. Besides his theological works, he published (in 1637) a Lexicon Pentaglotton. Died April, 1640. "
3802,NOTES.,"766. _Time is the bound of things_, etc. From Seneca, _Consol. ad Marc._ xix.: Excessit filius tuus terminos intra quos servitur ... mors omnium dolorum solutio est et finis. "

3810,NOTES.,"780. _Kings ought to shear_, etc. A saying of Tiberius quoted by Suetonius: Boni pastoris est tondere oves, non deglubere. Herrick probably took it from Ben Jonson's _Discoveries_. "
3811,NOTES.,784-7. _Ceremonies for Christmas._ More will be found about the Yule-log in _Ceremonies for Candlemas Day_ (893); cp. also _The Wassail_ (476). 
3812,NOTES.,"788. _Power and Peace._ From Tacitus, _Ann._ iv. 4: Quanquam arduum sit eodem loci potentiam et concordiam esse. "
3813,NOTES.,"789. _Mistress Margaret Falconbridge._ A daughter, probably, of the Thomas Falconbridge of number 483. "
3814,NOTES.,"797. _Kisses._ Printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1650, with omission of me in l. 1. "
3815,NOTES.,"804. _John Crofts, Cup-bearer to the King._ Third son of Sir John Crofts, of Saxham, Suffolk. We hear of him in the king's service as early as 1628, and two years later Lord Conway, in thanking Wm. Weld for some verses sent him, hopes ""the lines are strong enough to bind Robert Maule and Jack Crofts from ever more using the phrase"". So Jack was probably a bit of a poet himself. He may be the Mr. Crofts for assaulting whom George, Lord Digby, was imprisoned a month and more, in 1634. "
3816,NOTES.,"807. _Man may want land to live in._ Tacitus, _Ann._ xiii. 56: Addidit [Boiocalus] Deësse nobis terra in quâ vivamus, in quâ moriamur non potest, quoted by Montaigne, II. 3. "

3818,NOTES.,"810. _Grief, if't be great 'tis short._ Seneca, quoted by Burton (II. iii. 1, § 1): ""Si longa est, levis est; si gravis est, brevis est. If it be long, 'tis light; if grievous, it cannot last."" "
3819,NOTES.,817. _The Amber Bead._ Cp. Martial's epigram quoted in Note to 497. The comparison to Cleopatra is from Mart. IV. xxxii. 
3820,NOTES.,"818. _To my dearest sister, M. Mercy Herrick._ Not quite five years his senior. She married John Wingfield, of Brantham, Suffolk, to whom also Herrick addresses a poem. "
3821,NOTES.,"820. _Suffer that thou canst not shift._ From Seneca; the title from _Ep._ cvii.: Optimum est pati quod emendare non possis, the epigram from _De Provid._ 4, as translated by Thomas Lodge, 1614, ""Vertuous instructions are never delicate. Doth fortune beat and rend us? Let us suffer it""--whence Herrick reproduces the printer's error, _Vertuous_ for Vertues (Virtue's). "
3822,NOTES.,"821. _For a stone has Heaven his tomb._ Cp. Sir T. Browne, _Relig. Med._ § 40: ""Nor doe I altogether follow that rodomontado of Lucan (_Phars._ vii. 819): Coelo tegitur qui non habet urnam, "

3826,NOTES.,830. _His Loss._ A reference to his ejection from Dean Prior. 
3827,NOTES.,"837. _Mistress Amy Potter._ Daughter of Barnabas Potter, Bishop of Carlisle, Herrick's predecessor at Dean Prior. "
3828,NOTES.,"839. _Love is a circle ... from good to good._ So Burton, III. i. 1, § 2: Circulus a bono in bonum. "
3829,NOTES.,"844. TO HIS BOOK. _Make haste away._ Martial, III. ii. Ad Librum suum--Festina tibi vindicem parare, Ne nigram cito raptus in culinam Cordyllas madidâ tegas papyro, Vel thuris piperisque sis cucullus. _To make loose gowns for mackerel._ From Catullus, xcv. 1:-- "

3833,NOTES.,"851. _To Mr. Henry Lawes, the excellent composer of his lyrics._ Henry Lawes (1595-1662), the friend of Milton, admitted a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, 1625. In the _Noble Numbers_ he is mentioned as the composer of Herrick's _Christmas Carol_ and the first of his two _New-Year's Gifts_. Lawes also set to music Herrick's _Not to Love_, _To Mrs. Eliz. Wheeler_ (Among the Myrtles as I walked), _The Kiss_, _The Primrose_, _To a Gentlewoman objecting to him his Grey Hairs_, and doubtless others. "
3838,NOTES.,"861. _Kings seek their subjects' good, tyrants their own._ Aristot. _Politics_, iii. 7: καλεῖν εἰώθαμεν τῶν μὲν μοναρχιῶν τὴν πρὸς τὸ κοινὸν ἀποβλέπουσαν συμφέρον βασιλείαν ... ἡ τυραννίς ἐστι μοναρχία πρὸς τὸ συμφέρον τὸ τοῦ μοναρχοῦντος. "
3839,NOTES.,"869. _Sir Thomas Heale._ Probably a son of the Sir Thomas Hele, of Fleet, Co. Devon, who died in 1624. This Sir Thomas was created a baronet in 1627, and according to Dr. Grosart was one of the Royalist commanders at the siege of Plymouth. He died 1670. "
3840,NOTES.,"872. _Love is a kind of war._ Ovid, _Ars Am._ II. 233, 34:-- "
3841,NOTES.,Militiae species amor est: discedite segnes! Non sunt haec timidis signa tuenda viris.

3846,NOTES.,"885. _Naught are all women._ Burton, III. ii. 5. § 5. "
3847,NOTES.,"907. _Upon Mr. William Lawes, the rare musician._ Elder brother of the more famous Henry Lawes; appointed a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, 1602, and also one of Charles I.'s musicians-in-ordinary. When the Civil War broke out he joined the king's army and was killed by a stray shot during the siege of Chester, 1645. He set Herrick's _Gather ye rosebuds_ to music. "
3849,NOTES.,"Lex haec carminibus data est jocosis, Ne possint, nisi pruriant, juvare. "
3850,NOTES.,"918. _M. Kellam._ As yet unidentified. Dr. Grosart suggests that he may have been one of Herrick's parishioners, and the name sounds as of the west country. "
3851,NOTES.,"920. _Cunctation in correction._ Is Herrick translating? According to a relief at Rome the lictors' rods were bound together not only by a red thong twisted from top to bottom, but by six straps as well. "
3852,NOTES.,"922. _Continual reaping makes a land wax old._ Ovid, _Ars Am._ iii. 82: Continua messe senescit ager. "
3853,NOTES.,"923. _Revenge._ Tacitus, _Hist._ iv. 3: Tanto proclivius est injuriae quàm beneficio vicem exsolvere; quia gratia oneri, ultio in quaestu habetur. "
3854,NOTES.,"927. _Praise they that will times past._ Ovid, _Ars Am._ iii. 121:-- "
3855,NOTES.,Prisca juvent alios: ego me nunc denique natum Gratulor; haec aetas moribus apta meis. 
3856,NOTES.,928. _Clothes are conspirators._ I can suggest no better explanation of this oracular epigram than that the tailor's bill is an enemy of a slender purse. 
3857,NOTES.,"929. _Cruelty_. Seneca _de Clem._ i. 24: Ferina ista rabies est, sanguine gaudere et vulneribus; (i. 8), Quemadmodum praecisae arbores plurimis ramis repullulant [H. uses repullulate, -tion, 336, 794], et multa satorum genera, ut densiora surgant, reciduntur; ita regia crudelitas auget inimicorum numerum tollendo. Ben Jonson, _Discoveries_ (_Clementia_): ""The lopping of trees makes the boughs shoot out quicker; and the taking away of some kind of enemies increaseth the number"". "
3858,NOTES.,931. _A fierce desire of hot and dry._ Cp. note on 683. 
3859,NOTES.,"932. _To hear the worst_, etc. Antisthenes ap. _Diog. Laert._ VI. i. 4, § 3: Ἀκούσας ποτὲ ὅτι Πλάτων αὐτὸν κακῶς λέγει Βασιλικὸν ἔφη καλῶς ποιοῦντα κακῶς ἀκούειν, quoted by Burton, II. iii. 7. "
3860,NOTES.,"934. _The Bondman._ Cp. Exodus xxi. 5, 6: ""And if the servant shall plainly say: I love my master, my wife, and my children: I will not go out free: Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the doorpost; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever"". "
3861,NOTES.,"936. _My kiss outwent the bonds of shamefastness._ Cp. Sidney's _Astrophel and Stella_, sonnet 82. For _not Jove himself_, etc., cp. 10, and note. "

3864,NOTES.,"939. _Upon Julia washing herself in the river._ Imitated from Martial, IV. xxii.:-- "
3865,NOTES.,"Primos passa toros et adhuc placanda marito Merserat in nitidos se Cleopatra lacus, Dum fugit amplexus: sed prodidit unda latentem, Lucebat, totis cum tegeretur aquis. Condita sic puro numerantur lilia vitro, Sic prohibet tenuis gemma latere rosas, Insilui mersusque vadis luctantia carpsi Basia: perspicuae plus vetuistis aquae. "
3866,NOTES.,"940. _Though frankincense_, etc. Ovid, _de Medic. Fac._ 83, 84:-- "
3867,NOTES.,"Quamvis thura deos irataque numina placent, Non tamen accensis omnia danda focis. "
3868,NOTES.,"947. _To his honoured and most ingenious friend, Mr. Charles Cotton._ Dr. Grosart annotates: ""The translator of Montaigne, and associate of Izaak Walton""; but as the younger Cotton was only eighteen when _Hesperides_ was printed, it is perhaps more probable that the father is meant, though we may note that Herrick and the younger Cotton were joint-contributors in 1649 to the _Lacrymæ Musarum_, published in memory of Lord Hastings. For a tribute to the brilliant abilities of the elder Cotton, see Clarendon's _Life_ (i. 36; ed. 1827). "
3869,NOTES.,"948. _Women Useless._ A variation on a theme as old as Euripides. Cp. _Medea_, 573-5:-- "
3870,NOTES.,"χρῆν γὰρ ἀλλοθέν ποθεν βροτοὺς παῖδας τεκνοῦσθαι, θῆλυ δ' οὐκ εἶναι γένος· χοὒτως ἂν οὐκ ἦν οὐδὲν ἀνθρώποις κακόν. "
3871,NOTES.,"952. _Weep for the dead, for they have lost the light_, cp. Ecclus. xxii. 11. "
3872,NOTES.,"955. _To M. Leonard Willan, his peculiar friend._ A wretched poet; author of ""The Phrygian Fabulist; or the Fables of Æsop"" (1650), ""Astraea; or True Love's Mirror"" (1651), etc. "
3873,NOTES.,"956. _Mr. John Hall, Student of Gray's Inn._ Hall remained at Cambridge till 1647, and this poem, which addresses him as a ""Student of Gray's Inn,"" must therefore have been written almost while _Hesperides_ was passing through the press. Hall's _Horæ Vacivæ, or Essays_, published in 1646, had at once given him high rank among the wits. "
3874,NOTES.,958. _To the most comely and proper M. Elizabeth Finch._ No certain identification has been proposed. 
3875,NOTES.,"961. _To the King, upon his welcome to Hampton Court, set and sung._ The allusion can only be to the king's stay at Hampton Court in 1647. Good hope was then entertained of a peaceful settlement, and Herrick's ode, enthusiastic as it is, expresses little more than this. "
3876,NOTES.,"_For an ascendent_, etc.: This and the next seven lines are taken from phrases on pp. 29-33 of the _Notes and Observations on some passages of Scripture_, by John Gregory (see note on N. N. 178). According to Gregory, ""The Ascendent of a City is that sign which riseth in the Heavens at the laying of the first stone"". "
3877,NOTES.,"962. _Henry, Marquis of Dorchester._ Henry Pierrepoint, second Earl of Kingston, succeeded his father (Herrick's Newark) July 30, 1643, and was created Marquis of Dorchester, March, 1645. ""He was a very studious nobleman and very learned, particularly in law and physics."" (See Burke's _Extinct Peerages_, iii. 435.) "
3878,NOTES.,"_When Cato, the severe, entered the circumspacious theatre._ The allusion is to the visit of Cato to the games of Flora, given by Messius. When his presence in the theatre was known, the dancing-women were not allowed to perform in their accustomed lack of costume, whereupon the moralist obligingly retired, amidst applause. "
3879,NOTES.,"966. _M. Jo. Harmar, physician to the College of Westminster._ John Harmar, born at Churchdown, near Gloucester, about 1594, was educated at Winchester and Magdalen College, Oxford; was a master at Magdalen School, the Free School at St. Albans, and at Westminster, and Professor of Greek at Oxford under the Commonwealth. He died 1670. Wood characterises him as a butt for the wits and a flatterer of great men, and notes that he was always called by the name of Doctor Harmar, though he took no higher degree than M.A. But in 1632 he supplicated for the degree of M.B., and Dr. Grosart's note--""Herrick, no doubt, playfully transmuted 'Doctor' into 'Physician'""--is misleading. He may have cared for the minds and bodies of the Westminster boys at one and the same time. "
3880,NOTES.,"_The Roman language.... If Jove would speak_, etc. Cp. Ben Jonson's _Discoveries_: ""that testimony given by L. Aelius Stilo upon Plautus who affirmed, ""Musas si latine loqui voluissent Plautino sermone fuisse loquuturas"". And Cicero [in Plutarch, § 24] ""said of the Dialogues of Plato, that Jupiter, if it were his nature to use language, would speak like him"". "

3885,NOTES.,"978. _Upon the Lady Crew._ Cp. Herrick's Epithalamium for her marriage with Sir Clipsby Crew, 283. She died 1639, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. "

3892,NOTES.,"1002. _To the Lord Hopton on his fight in Cornwall._ Sir Ralph Hopton won two brilliant victories for the Royalists, at Bradock Down and Stratton, January and May, 1643, and was created Baron Hopton in the following September. Originally a Parliamentarian, he was one of the king's ablest and most loyal servants. "

3898,NOTES.,"1026. _Saint Distaff's Day._ ""Saint Distaff is perhaps only a coinage of our poet's to designate the day when, the Christmas vacation being over, good housewives, with others, resumed their usual employment."" (Nott.) The phrase is explained in dictionaries and handbooks, but no other use of it is quoted than this. Herrick's poem was pilfered by Henry Bold (a notorious plagiarist) in _Wit a-sporting in a pleasant Grove of New Fancies_, 1657. "
3899,NOTES.,"1028. _My beloved Westminster._ As mentioned in the brief ""Life"" of Herrick prefixed to vol. i., all the references in this poem seem to refer to Herrick's courtier-days, between leaving Cambridge and going to Devonshire. He then, doubtless, resided in Westminster for the sake of proximity to Whitehall. It has been suggested, however, that the reference is to Westminster School, but we have no evidence that Herrick was educated there. "
3900,NOTES.,"_Golden Cheapside._ My friend, Mr. Herbert Horne, in his admirably-chosen selection from the _Hesperides_, suggests that the allusion here is to the great gilt cross at the end of Wood Street. The suggestion is ingenious; but as Cheapside was the goldsmiths' quarter this would amply justify the epithet, which may indeed only refer to Cheapside as a money-winning street, as we might say Golden Lombard Street. "

3903,NOTES.,"1035. _Twelfth Night: or King and Queen._ Herrick alludes to these ""Twelfth-Tide Kings and Queens"" in writing to Endymion Porter (662), and earlier still, in the ""New-Year's Gift to Sir Simeon Steward"" (319) he speaks-- "
3904,NOTES.,"""Of Twelfth-Tide cakes, of Peas and Beans, Wherewith ye make those merry scenes, Whenas ye choose your King and Queen"". "
3905,NOTES.,"Brand (i. 27) illustrates well from ""Speeches to the Queen at Sudley"" in Nichols' _Progresses of Queen Elizabeth_. "
3906,NOTES.,"""_Melibœus._ Cut the cake: who hath the bean shall be king, and where the pea is, she shall be queen. "
3909,NOTES.,"1045. _Comfort in Calamity._ An allusion to the ejection from their benefices which befel most of the loyal clergy at the same time as Herrick. It is perhaps worth noting that in the second volume of this edition, and in the last hundred poems printed in the first, wherever a date can be fixed it is always in the forties. Equally late poems occur, though much less frequently, among the first five hundred, but there the dated poems belong, for the most part, to the years 1623-1640. Now, in April 29, 1640, as stated in the brief ""Life"" prefixed to vol. i., there was entered at Stationers' Hall, ""The severall poems written by Master Robert Herrick,"" a book which, as far as is known, never saw the light. It was probably, however, to this book that Herrick addressed the poem (405) beginning:-- "
3910,NOTES.,"""Have I not blest thee? Then go forth, nor fear Or spice, or fish, or fire, or close-stools here""; "
3911,NOTES.,"and we may fairly regard the first five hundred poems of _Hesperides_ as representing the intended collection of 1640, with a few additions, and the last six hundred as for the most part later, and I must add, inferior work. This is borne out by the absence of any manuscript versions of poems in the second half of the book. Herrick's verses would only be passed from hand to hand when he was living among the wits in London. "

3917,NOTES.,"1056. _To his peculiar friend, M. Jo. Wicks._ See 336 and Note. Written after Herrick's ejection. We know that the poet's uncle, Sir William Herrick, suffered greatly in estate during the Civil War, and it may have been the same with other friends and relatives. But there can be little doubt that the poet found abundant hospitality on his return to London. "

3920,NOTES.,"1062. _To Sir George Parry, Doctor of the Civil Law._ According to Dr. Grosart, Parry ""was admitted to the College of Advocates, London, 3rd Nov., 1628; but almost nothing has been transmitted concerning him save that he married the daughter and heir of Sir Giles Sweet, Dean of Arches"". I can hardly doubt that he must be identified with the Dr. George Parry, Chancellor to the Bishop of Exeter, who in 1630 was accused of excommunicating persons for the sake of fees, but was highly praised in 1635 and soon after appointed a Judge Marshal. If so, his wife was a widow when she came to him, as she is spoken of in 1638 as ""Lady Dorothy Smith, wife of Sir Nicholas Smith, deceased"". She brought him a rich dower, and her death greatly confused his affairs. "
3921,NOTES.,"1067. _Gentleness._ Seneca, _Phoen._ 659: Qui vult amari, languidâ regnet manu. And Ben Jonson, _Panegyre_ (1603): ""He knew that those who would with love command, Must with a tender yet a steadfast hand, Sustain the reins"". "

3924,NOTES.,"1080. _The Mistress of all singular Manners, Mistress Portman._ Dr. Grosart notes that a Mrs. Mary Portman was buried at Putney Parish Church, June 27, 1671, and this was perhaps Herrick's schoolmistress, the ""pearl of Putney"". "

3927,NOTES.,"1089. _To M. Laurence Swetnaham._ Unless the various entries in the parish registers of St. Margaret's, Westminster, refer to different men, this Lawrence Swetnaham was the third son of Thomas Swettenham of Swettenham in Cheshire, married in 1602 to Mary Birtles. Lawrence himself had children as early as 1629, and ten years later was church-warden. He was buried in the Abbey, 1673. "

3929,NOTES.,"1092. _Michael Oulsworth._ Michael Oulsworth, Oldsworth or Oldisworth, graduated M.A. from Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1614. According to Wood, ""he was afterwards Fellow of his College, Secretary to Earl of Pembroke, elected a burgess to serve in several Parliaments for Sarum and Old Sarum, and though in the Grand Rebellion he was no Colonel, yet he was Governor of Old Pembroke, and Montgomery led him by the nose as he pleased, to serve both their turns"". The partnership, however, was not eternal, for between 1648 and 1650 Oldisworth published at least eight virulent satires against his former master. "

3951,NOBLE NUMBERS.,38. _Upon Time._ Were this poem anonymous it would probably be attributed rather to George Herbert than to Herrick. 
3952,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"41. _His Litany to the Holy Spirit._ We may quote again from Barron Field's account in the _Quarterly Review_ (1810) of his cross-examination of the Dean Prior villagers for Reminiscences of Herrick: ""The person, however, who knows more of Herrick than all the rest of the neighbourhood we found to be a poor woman in the 99th year of her age, named Dorothy King. She repeated to us, with great exactness, five of his _Noble Numbers_, among which was his beautiful 'Litany'. These she had learnt from her mother, who was apprenticed to Herrick's successor at the vicarage. She called them her prayers, which she said she was in the habit of putting up in bed, whenever she could not sleep; and she therefore began the 'Litany' at the second stanza:-- "
3955,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"""Every night Thou dost me fright, And keep mine eyes from sleeping,"" etc. "
3956,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"The last couplet, it should be noted, is misquoted from No. 56. "

3958,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"59. _A Present by a Child._ Cp. ""A pastoral upon the Birth of Prince Charles"" (_Hesperides_ 213), and Note. "
3959,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"63. _God's mirth: man's mourning._ Perhaps founded on Prov. i. 26: ""I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh"". "
3960,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"65. _My Alma._ The name is probably suggested by its meaning ""soul"". Cp. Prior's _Alma_. "
3961,NOBLE NUMBERS.,72. _I'll cast a mist and cloud._ Cp. Hor. I. _Ep._ xvi. 62: Noctem peccatis et fraudibus objice nubem.

3965,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"88. _By Faith we ... walk ..., not by the Spirit._ 2 Cor. v. 7: ""We walk by faith, not by sight"". 'By the Spirit' perhaps means, 'in spiritual bodies'. "
3967,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"_Composed by M. Henry Lawes._ See _Hesperides_ 851, and Note. "
3968,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"102. _The Star-Song._ This may have been composed partly with reference to the noonday star during the Thanksgiving for Charles II.'s birth. See _Hesperides_ 213, and Note. "
3969,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"_We'll choose him King._ A reference to the Twelfth Night games. See _Hesperides_ 1035, and Note. "
3970,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"108. _Good men afflicted most._ Taken almost entirely from Seneca, _de Provid._ 3, 4: Ignem experitur [Fortuna] in Mucio, paupertatem in Fabricio, ... tormenta in Regulo, venenum in Socrate, mortem in Catone. The allusions may be briefly explained for the unclassical. At the siege of Dyrrachium, Marcus Cassius Scæva caught 120 darts on his shield; Horatius Cocles is the hero of the bridge (see Macaulay's _Lays_); C. Mucius Scævola held his hand in the fire to illustrate to Porsenna Roman fearlessness; Cato is Cato Uticensis, the philosophic suicide; ""high Atilius"" will be more easily recognised as the M. Atilius Regulus who defied the Carthaginians; Fabricius Luscinus refused not only the presents of Pyrrhus, but all reward of the State, and lived in poverty on his own farm. "
3971,NOBLE NUMBERS.,109. _A wood of darts._ Cp. Virg. _Æn._ x. 886: Ter secum Troius heros Immanem aerato circumfert tegmine silvam. 
3972,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"112. _The Recompense._ Herrick is said to have assumed the lay habit on his return to London after his ejection, perhaps as a protection against further persecution. This quatrain may be taken as evidence that he did not throw off his religion with his cassock. Compare also 124. "
3973,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"_All I have lost that could be rapt from me._ From Ovid, III. _Trist._ vii. 414: Raptaque sint adimi quae potuere mihi. "
3974,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"123. _Thy light that ne'er went out._ Prov. xxxi. 18 (of 'the Excellent Woman'): ""Her candle goeth not out by night"". _All set about with lilies._ Cp. _Cant. Canticorum_, vii. 2: Venter tuus sicut acervus tritici, vallatus liliis. "

3980,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"147. _As Cassiodore doth prove._ Reverentia est enim Domini timor cum amore permixtus. Cassiodor. _Expos. in Psalt._ xxxiv. 30; quoted by Dr. Grosart. My clerical predecessor has also hunted down with much industry the possible sources of most of the other patristic references in _Noble Numbers_, though I have been able to add a few. We may note that Herrick quotes Cassiodorus (twice), John of Damascus, Boethius, Thomas Aquinas, St. Bernard, St. Augustine (thrice), St. Basil, and St. Ambrose--a goodly list of Fathers, if we had any reason to suppose that the quotations were made at first hand. "
3981,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"148. _Mercy ... a Deity._ Pausanias, _Attic._ I. xvii. 1. "
3982,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"153. _Mora Sponsi, the stay of the bridegroom._ Maldonatus, _Comm. in Matth._ xxv.: Hieronymus et Hilarius moram sponsi pœnitentiae tempus esse dicunt. "
3983,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"157. _Montes Scripturarum._ See August. _Enarr. in Ps._ xxxix., and passim. "
3984,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"167. _A dereliction._ The word is from Ps. xxii. 1: Quare me dereliquisti? ""Why hast Thou forsaken me?"" Herrick took it from Gregory's _Notes and Observations_ (see infra), p. 5: 'Our Saviour ... in that great case of dereliction'. "
3985,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"174. _Martha, Martha._ See Luke x. 41, and August. _Serm._ cii. 3: Repetitio nominis indicium est dilectionis. "
3986,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"177. _Paradise._ Gregory, p. 75, on ""the reverend Say of Zoroaster, Seek Paradise,"" quotes from the Scholiast Psellus: ""The Chaldæan Paradise (saith he) is a Quire of divine powers incircling the Father"". "
3987,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"178. _The Jews when they built houses._ Herrick's rabbinical lore (cp. 180, 181, 193, 207, 224), like his patristic, was probably derived at second hand through some biblical commentary. Much of it certainly comes from the _Notes and Observations upon some Passages of Scripture_ (Oxford, 1646) of John Gregory, chaplain of Christ Church, a prodigy of oriental learning, who died in his 39th year, March 13, 1646. Thus in his Address to the Reader (3rd page from end) Gregory remarks: ""The Jews, when they build a house, are bound to leave some part of it unfinished in memory of the destruction of Jerusalem,"" giving a reference to Leo of Modena, _Degli Riti Hebraici_, Part I. "
3988,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"180. _Observation. The Virgin Mother_, etc. Gregory, pp. 24-27, shows that Sitting, the usual posture of mourners, was forbidden by both Roman and Jewish Law ""in capital causes"". ""This was the reason why ... she stood up still in a resolute and almost impossible compliance with the Law.... They sat ... after leave obtained ... to bury the body."" "
3989,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"181. _Tapers._ Cp. Gregory's _Notes_, p. 111: ""The funeral tapers (however thought of by some) are of the same harmless import. Their meaning is to show that the departed souls are not quite put out, but having walked here as the children of the Light are now gone to walk before God in the light of the living."" "
3990,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"185. _God in the holy tongue._ J. G., p. 135: ""God is called in the Holy Tongue ... the Place; or that Fulness which filleth All in All"". "
3991,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"186, 187, 188, 189, 197. _God's Presence, Dwelling_, etc. J. G., pp. 135-9: ""Shecinah, or God's Dwelling Presence"". ""God is said to be nearer to this man than to that, more in one place than in another. Thus he is said to depart from some and come to others, to leave this place and to abide in that, not by essential application of Himself, much less by local motion, but by impression of effect."" ""With just men (saith St. Bernard) God is present, _in veritate_, in deed, but with the wicked, dissemblingly."" ""He is called in the Holy Tongue, Jehovah, He that is, or Essence."" ""He is said to dwell there (saith Maimon) where He putteth the marks ... of His Majesty; and He doth this by His Grace and Holy Spirit."" "
3992,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"190. _The Virgin Mary._ J. G., p. 86: ""St. Ephrem upon those words of Jacob, This is the House of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven. This saying (saith he) is to be meant of the Virgin Mary ... truly to be called the House of God, as wherein the Son of God ... inhabited, and as truly the Gate of Heaven, for the Lord of heaven and earth entered thereat; and it shall not be set open the second time, according to that of Ezekiel (xliv. 2): I saw (saith he) a gate in the East; the glorious Lord entered thereat; thenceforth that gate was shut, and is not any more to be opened (_Catena Arab._ c. 58)."" "
3993,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"192. _Upon Woman and Mary._ The reference is to Christ's appearance to St. Mary Magdalene in the Garden after the Resurrection, John xx. 15, 16. "
3994,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"193. _North and South._ Comp. _Hesper._ 429. _Observation_. J. G., pp. 92, 93: ""Whosoever (say the Doctors in Berachoth) shall set his bed N. and S., shall beget male children. Therefore the Jews hold this rite of collocation ... to this day.... They are bound to place their ... house of office in the very same situation ... that the uncomely necessities ... might not fall into the Walk and Ways of God, whose Shecinah or dwelling presence lieth W. and E."" "
3995,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"195. _Noah the first was_, etc. Cp. Gregory, _Notes_, p. 28. "
3996,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"201. _Temporal goods._ August., quoted by Burton, II. iii. 3: Dantur quidem bonis, saith Austin, ne quis mala aestimet, malis autem ne quis nimis bona. "
3997,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"203. _Speak, did the blood of Abel cry_, etc. Cp. Gregory's _Notes_, pp. 118: ""But did the blood of Abel speak? saith Theophylact. Yes, it cried unto God for vengeance, as that of sprinkling for propitiation and mercy."" "
3998,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"204. _A thing of such a reverend reckoning._ Cp. Gregory, 118-9: ""The blood of Abel was so holy and reverend a thing, in the sense and reputation of the old world, that the men of that time used to swear by it"". "
3999,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"205. _A Position in the Hebrew Divinity._ From Gregory's _Notes_, pp. 134, 5: ""That old position in the Hebrew Divinity ... that a repenting man is of more esteem in the sight of God than one that never fell away"". "
4000,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"206. _The Doctors in the Talmud._ From Gregory's _Notes_, _l.c._: ""The Doctors in the Talmud say, that one day spent here in true Repentance is more worth than eternity itself, or all the days of heaven in the other world"". "
4001,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"207. _God's Presence._ Again from Gregory's Notes, pp. 136 sq. "
4002,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"208. _The Resurrection._ Gregory's _Notes_, pp. 128-29, translating from a Greek MS. of Mathæus Blastares in the Bodleian: ""The wonder of this is far above that of the resurrection of our bodies; for then the earth giveth up her dead but one for one, but in the case of the corn she giveth up many living ones for one dead one"". "
4003,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"243. _Confession twofold is._ August, in Ps. xxix. _Enarr._ ii. 19: Confessio gemina est, aut peccati, aut laudis. "
4004,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"254. _Gold and frankincense._ St. Matt. ii. 11. St. Ambrose. Aurum Regi, thus Deo. "
4006,NOBLE NUMBERS.,"258. _As my little pot doth boil_, etc. This far-fetched little poem is an instance of Herrick's habit of jotting down his thoughts in verse. In cooking some food for a charitable purpose he seems to have noticed that the boiling pot tossed the meat to and fro, or ""waved"" it (the priest's work), and that he himself was giving away the meat he lifted off the fire, the ""heave-offering,"" which was the priest's perquisite. This is the confusion or ""level-coil"" to which he alludes. "
4008,NOTES TO ADDITIONAL POEMS.,"_The Description of a Woman_. Printed in _Witts Recreations_, 1645, and contained also in Ashmole MS. 38, where it is signed: ""Finis. Robert Herrick."" Our version is taken from _Witts Recreations_, with the exception of the readings _show_ and _grow_ (for _shown_ and _grown_, in ll. 15 and 16). The Ashmole MS. contains in all thirty additional lines, which may or may not be by Herrick, but which, as not improving the poem, have been omitted in our text in accordance with the precedent set by the editor of _Witts Recreations_.

4011,NOTES TO ADDITIONAL POEMS.,"For _some sleepy keys_ the Museum MS. reads, _the sleeping keys_; for _yet forc't they are to go_ it has _and yet are forc't to go_; _drinking to the odd Number of Nine_ for _Number of Wine_, as to which see below; _turned her home_ for _twirled her home_; _dear soul_ for _rare soul_. All these are possible, but _beloved Africa_, and the omission of the two half lines, ""'tis not need The scarecrow unto mankind,"" are pure blunders. "

This is the only poem which we know of Herrick's, written after 1648, and even in this Herrick uses materials already employed in ""Charon and the Nightingale"" in _Hesperides_. "
4025,NOTES TO ADDITIONAL POEMS.,_Epitaph on the Tomb of Sir Edward Giles._ First printed by Dr. Grosart from the monument in Dean Prior Church. Sir Edward Giles was the occupant of Dean Court and the magnate of the parish. 
4028,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,Both Mr. Hazlitt and Dr. Grosart have slightly misrepresented the relation of _Hesperides_ to the anthology known as _Witts Recreations_: Mr. Hazlitt by mistakes as to their respective contents; Dr. Grosart (after a much more careful collation) by taking down the date of the wrong edition. To put matters straight four editions have to be examined:-- 
4029,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"I. ""Witts Recreations. Selected from the finest Fancies of Moderne Muses, With a Thousand out Landish Proverbs. _London. Printed for Humph. Blunden at ye Castle in Cornhill, 1640._ 8vo."" "
4030,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"This general title-page is engraved by W. Marshall. The Outlandish Proverbs were selected by George Herbert, and, like the first part, have a printed title-page of their own. "
4031,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"II. ""Witts Recreations. Augmented with Ingenious Conceites for the wittie and Merrie Medicines for the Melancholie. _London. Printed for Humph. Blunden: at ye Castle in Cornhill, 1641._ 8vo."" "
4032,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"In this, and subsequent editions, Marshall's title-page is re-engraved and the Outlandish Proverbs are omitted. The printed title-page reads: ""Wit's Recreations. Containing 630 Epigrams, 160 Epitaphs. Variety of Fancies and Fantasticks, Good for Melancholly humours. _London. Printed by Thomas Cotes_,"" etc. The epigrams vary considerably from the selection in the previous edition. "
4033,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"III. ""Witts Recreations refined. Augmented, with Ingenious Conceites for the wittie, and Merrie Medicines for the Melancholie...."" "
4034,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"In the Museum copy of this edition the imprint to the engraved title has been cropped away. The printed title-page reads: ""Recreation for Ingenious Head-peeces. Or, A Pleasant Grove for their Wits to walke in. Of Epigrams, 630: Epitaphs, 180: Fancies, a number: Fantasticks, abundance, Good for melancholy Humors. _Printed by R. Cotes for H. B. London, 1645._ 8vo."" Two poems of Herrick's occur in the additional ""Fancies and Fantasticks,"" first printed in this edition, viz.: _The Description of a Woman_ (not contained in _Hesperides_), and the _Farewell to Sack_. "
4035,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"IV. ""Witts Recreations refined. Augmented, with Ingenious Conceites for the wittie and Merrie Medicines for the Melancholie. _Printed by M. S. sould by I. Hancock in Popes head Alley, 1650._ 8vo."" "
4036,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"The printed title-page reads: ""Recreations for Ingenious Head-peeces. Or, A Pleasant Grove for their Wits to Walke in. Of Epigrams, 700: Epitaphs, 200: Fancies, a number: Fantasticks, abundance. With their Addition, Multiplication, and Division. _London, Printed by M. Simmons_,"" etc. In this edition many of the Epigrams are omitted and more than one hundred fresh ones added. Additions are also made to the Epitaphs and Fancies and Fantasticks. Of the new Epigrams and Poems no less than seventy-two had been printed two years earlier in Herrick's _Hesperides_, and ten others were added in 1654 from the same source. "
4037,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"_Witts Recreations_ was again reprinted in 1663, 1667, and perhaps oftener. In 1817 it was issued as vol. ii. of a collection of _Facetiæ_, of which Mennis and Smith's _Musarum Deliciæ_ and _Wit Restor'd_ formed vol. i. On the title-page _Witts Recreations_ is said to be printed from edition 1640, with all the wood engravings and improvements of subsequent editions, and in the preface it is explained to be ""reprinted after a collation of the four editions, 1640, 41, 54, and 63, for the purpose of bringing together in one body all the various articles spread throughout, and not to be found in any one edition"". This 1817 reprint was re-issued by Hotten in 1874, and this re-issue, as his references to pagination show, was the one used by Dr. Grosart. The date 1640 on the title-page may have caught his eye and led to his mistaken allusion to the ""prior publication"" of the Herrick poems in 1640, whereas _Hesperides_ was published in 1648, and the editions of _Witts Recreations_ which contain anything of his besides the _Description of a Woman_ and _A Farewell to Sack_, in 1650, 1654, etc. "
4038,HERRICK'S POEMS IN WITTS RECREATIONS.,"In the Notes to the present edition I have drawn attention to all variations in the text of the poems as printed by Herrick and the later editors, and now subjoin a complete list of the poems under the titles which they take in _Witts Recreations_, with their numbers in this edition. "

4046,FAYRIES PUBLISHED 1635.,HERRICK'S FAIRY POEMS AND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE KING AND QUEENE OF FAYRIES PUBLISHED 1635. 
4047,FAYRIES PUBLISHED 1635.,"The publisher's freak, by which Herrick's three chief Fairy poems (""The Fairy Temple; or, Oberon's Chapel,"" ""Oberon's Feast,"" and ""Oberon's Palace"") are separated from each other, is greatly to be regretted. The last two, both dedicated to Shapcott, are distinctly connected by their opening lines, and ""Oberon's Chapel,"" dedicated to Mr. John Merrifield, Herrick's other fairy-loving lawyer, of course belongs to the same group. All three were probably first written in 1626 and cannot be dissociated from Drayton's _Nymphidia_, published in 1627, and Sir Simeon Steward's ""A Description of the King of Fayries clothes, brought to him on New-yeares day in the morning, 1626 [O. S.], by his Queenes Chambermaids"". In 1635 there was published a little book of a dozen leaves, most kindly transcribed for this edition by Mr. E. Gordon Duff, from the unique copy at the Bodleian Library. It is entitled:-- "
4048,FAYRIES PUBLISHED 1635.,"""A | Description | of the King and Queene of | Fayries, their habit, fare, their | abode pompe and state. | Beeing very delightfull to the sense, and | full of mirth. | [Wood-cut.] London. | _Printed for Richard Harper, and are to be sold | at his shop, at the Hospitall gate._ 1635."" "
4049,FAYRIES PUBLISHED 1635.,"Fol. 1 is blank; fol. 2 occupied by the title-page; ff. 3, 4 (verso blank) by a letter ""To the Reader,"" signed: ""Yours hereafter, If now approved on, R. S.,"" beginning: ""Courteous Reader, I present thee here with the Description of the King of the Fayries, of his Attendants, Apparel, Gesture, and Victuals, which though comprehended in the brevity of so short a volume, yet as the Proverbe truely averres, it hath as mellifluous and pleasing discourse, as that whose amplitude contains the fulnesse of a bigger composition""; on fol. 5 (verso blank) occurs the following poem [spelling here modernised]:-- "
4050,"""R. S.""","""Deep-skilled Geographers, whose art and skill Do traverse all the world, and with their quill Declare the strangeness of each several clime, The nature, situation, and the time Of being inhabited, yet all their art And deep informèd skill could not impart In what set climate of this Orb or Isle, The King of Fairies kept, whose honoured style Is here inclosed, with the sincere description Of his abode, his nature, and the region In which he rules: read, and thou shalt find Delightful mirth, fit to content thy mind. May the contents thereof thy palate suit, With its mellifluous and pleasing fruit: For nought can more be sweetened to my mind Than that this Pamphlet thy contentment find; Which if it shall, my labour is sufficed, In being by your liking highly prized. ""Yours to his power, ""R. S."" "
4051,"""R. S.""","This is followed (pp. 1-3) by: ""A Description of the Kings [sic] of Fayries Clothes, brought to him on New-Yeares day in the morning, 1626, by his Queenes Chambermaids:-- "
4052,"""R. S.""","""First a cobweb shirt, more thin Than ever spider since could spin. Changed to the whiteness of the snow, By the stormy winds that blow In the vast and frozen air, No shirt half so fine, so fair; A rich waistcoat they did bring, Made of the Trout-fly's gilded wing: At which his Elveship 'gan to fret The wearing it would make him sweat Even with its weight: he needs would wear A waistcoat made of downy hair New shaven off an Eunuch's chin, That pleased him well, 'twas wondrous thin. The outside of his doublet was Made of the four-leaved, true-loved grass, Changed into so fine a gloss, With the oil of crispy moss: It made a rainbow in the night Which gave a lustre passing light. On every seam there was a lace Drawn by the unctuous snail's slow pace, To which the finest, purest, silver thread Compared, did look like dull pale lead. His breeches of the Fleece was wrought, Which from Colchos Jason brought: Spun into so fine a yarn No mortal wight might it discern, Weaved by Arachne on her loom, Just before she had her doom. A rich Mantle he did wear, Made of tinsel gossamer. Beflowered over with a few Diamond stars of morning dew: Dyed crimson in a maiden's blush, Lined with humble-bees' lost plush. His cap was all of ladies' love, So wondrous light, that it did move If any humming gnat or fly Buzzed the air in passing by, About his neck a wreath of pearl, Dropped from the eyes of some poor girl, Pinched, because she had forgot To leave clean water in the pot."" "
4053,"""R. S.""","The next page is occupied by a woodcut, and then (pp. 5, misnumbered 4, and 6) comes the variation on Herrick's ""Oberon's Feast"":-- "
4055,"""A DESCRIPTION OF HIS DIET.","""Now they, the Elves, within a trice, Prepared a feast less great than nice, Where you may imagine first, The Elves prepare to quench his thirst, In pure seed pearl of infant dew Brought and sweetened with a blue And pregnant violet; which done, His killing eyes begin to run Quite o'er the table, where he spies The horns of watered butterflies, Of which he eats, but with a little Neat cool allay of cuckoo's spittle. Next this the red-cap worm that's shut Within the concave of a nut. Moles' eyes he tastes, then adders' ears; To these for sauce the slain stags' tears, A bloated earwig, and the pith Of sugared rush he glads him with. Then he takes a little moth, Late fatted in a scarlet cloth, A spinner's ham, the beards of mice, Nits carbonadoed, a device Before unknown; the blood of fleas, Which gave his Elveship's stomach ease. The unctuous dew-laps of a snail, The broke heart of a nightingale O'ercome in music, with the sag And well-bestrutted bee's sweet bag. Conserves of atoms, and the mites, The silk-worm's sperm, and the delights Of all that ever yet hath blest Fairy-land: so ends his feast."" "
4056,"""A DESCRIPTION OF HIS DIET.","On the next page is printed: ""Orpheus. Thrice excelling, for the finishment of this Feast, thou must music it so that the Deities may descend to grace it."" This is succeeded by a page bearing a woodcut, then we have ""The Fairies Fegaries,"" a poem occupying three more pages followed by another woodcut, and then ""The Melancholly Lover's Song,"" and a third woodcut. The occurrence of the _Melancholy Lover's Song_ (the well-known lines beginning: ""Hence all you vain delights"") in print in 1635 is interesting, as I believe that _The Nice Valour_, the play in which they occur, was not printed till 1647, and Milton's _Il Penseroso_, which they suggested, appeared in 1645. But the verses are rather out of place in the little Fairy-Book. "
4059,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"Herrick's name has been so persistently connected with _Poor Robert's Almanack_ that a few words must be said on the subject. There is, we are told, a Devonshire tradition ascribing the _Almanack_ to him, and this is accepted by Nichols in his _Leicestershire_, and ""accredited"" by Dr. Grosart. The tradition apparently rests on no better basis than Herrick's Christian name, and of the poems in the issues of the _Almanack_ which I have seen, it may be said, that, while the worst of them, save for some lack of neatness of turn, might conceivably have been by Herrick--on the principle that if Herrick could write some of his epigrams, he could write anything--the more ambitious poems it is quite impossible to attribute to the author of the _Hesperides_. But apart from opinion, the negative evidence is overwhelming. Of the three earliest issues in the British Museum, 1664, 1667 and 1669 (all in the annual collections of Almanacs, issued by the Stationers' Company, and all, it may be noted, bound for Charles II.), I transcribe the title-page of the first. ""Poor Robin. 1664. An Almanack After a New Fashion wherein the Reader may see (if he be not blinde) many remarkable things worthy of Observation. Containing a two-fold Kalendar, viz. the Iulian or English, and the Roundheads or Fanaticks: with their several Saints daies and Observations, upon every month. Written by Poor Robin, Knight of the burnt Island and a well-willer to the Mathematicks. Calculated for the Meridian of Saffron Walden, where the Pole is elevated 52 degrees and 6 minutes above the Horizon. London: Printed for the Company of Stationers."" "
4060,POOR ROBIN'S ALMANACK.,"In the 1667 issue the paragraph about the Pole runs: ""Where the Maypole is elevated (with a plumm cake on the top of it) 5 yards ¾ above the Market Cross"". The mention of Saffron Walden had apparently been ridiculed, and the author in this year joins in the laugh, and in 1669 omits the paragraph altogether. But what had Herrick at any time to do with Saffron Walden, and why should the poet, whose politics, apart from some personal devotion to Charles I., were distinctly moderate, mix himself up with an ultra-Cavalier publication? Also, if Herrick be ""Poor Robin"" we must attribute to him, at least, the greater part of the twenty-one ""Poor Robin"" publications, of which Mr. H. Ecroyd Smith gave a list in _Notes and Queries_, 6th series, vii. 321-3, _e.g._, ""Poor Robin's Perambulation from the Town of Saffron Walden to London"" (1678), ""The Merrie Exploits of Poor Robin, the Merrie Saddler of Walden,"" etc. These have been generally assigned to William Winstanley, the barber-poet, on the ground of a supposed similarity of style, and from ""Poor Robin"" having been written under a portrait of him. Mr. Ecroyd Smith, however, attributes them to Robert Winstanley (born, 1646, at Saffron Walden), younger brother of Henry Winstanley, the projector of the Eddystone Lighthouse. He assigns the credit of the ""identification"" to Mr. Joseph Clark, F.S.A., of the Roos, Saffron Walden, but does not state the grounds which led Mr. Clark to his conclusion, in itself probable enough. In any case there is no valid ground for connecting Herrick either with the _Almanack_ or with any of the other ""Poor Robin"" publications. "

My curls about her neck did crawl, And arms and hands they did enthrall: So that she could not freely stir, All parts there made one prisoner. But when I crept with leaves to hide Those parts, which maids keep unespy'd, Such fleeting pleasures there I took, That with the fancy I awoke; And found, ah me! this flesh of mine More like a stock than like a vine.
