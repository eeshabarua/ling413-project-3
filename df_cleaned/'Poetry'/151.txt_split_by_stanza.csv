5,PART THE FIRST.,"It is an ancient Mariner, And he stoppeth one of three. ""By thy long grey beard and glittering eye, Now wherefore stopp'st thou me? "
6,PART THE FIRST.,"""The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide, And I am next of kin; The guests are met, the feast is set: May'st hear the merry din."" "
7,PART THE FIRST.,"He holds him with his skinny hand, ""There was a ship,"" quoth he. ""Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!"" Eftsoons his hand dropt he. "
8,PART THE FIRST.,"He holds him with his glittering eye-- The Wedding-Guest stood still, And listens like a three years child: The Mariner hath his will. "
9,PART THE FIRST.,"The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone: He cannot chuse but hear; And thus spake on that ancient man, The bright-eyed Mariner. "
10,PART THE FIRST.,"The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared, Merrily did we drop Below the kirk, below the hill, Below the light-house top. "
11,PART THE FIRST.,"The Sun came up upon the left, Out of the sea came he! And he shone bright, and on the right Went down into the sea. "
12,PART THE FIRST.,"Higher and higher every day, Till over the mast at noon-- The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast, For he heard the loud bassoon. "
13,PART THE FIRST.,"The bride hath paced into the hall, Red as a rose is she; Nodding their heads before her goes The merry minstrelsy. "
14,PART THE FIRST.,"The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast, Yet he cannot chuse but hear; And thus spake on that ancient man, The bright-eyed Mariner. "
15,PART THE FIRST.,"And now the STORM-BLAST came, and he Was tyrannous and strong: He struck with his o'ertaking wings, And chased south along. "
16,PART THE FIRST.,"With sloping masts and dipping prow, As who pursued with yell and blow Still treads the shadow of his foe And forward bends his head, The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast, And southward aye we fled. "
17,PART THE FIRST.,"And now there came both mist and snow, And it grew wondrous cold: And ice, mast-high, came floating by, As green as emerald. "
18,PART THE FIRST.,And through the drifts the snowy clifts Did send a dismal sheen: Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken-- The ice was all between. 
19,PART THE FIRST.,"The ice was here, the ice was there, The ice was all around: It cracked and growled, and roared and howled, Like noises in a swound! "
20,PART THE FIRST.,"At length did cross an Albatross: Thorough the fog it came; As if it had been a Christian soul, We hailed it in God's name. "
21,PART THE FIRST.,"It ate the food it ne'er had eat, And round and round it flew. The ice did split with a thunder-fit; The helmsman steered us through! "
22,PART THE FIRST.,"And a good south wind sprung up behind; The Albatross did follow, And every day, for food or play, Came to the mariners' hollo! "
23,PART THE FIRST.,"In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud, It perched for vespers nine; Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white, Glimmered the white Moon-shine. "
24,PART THE FIRST.,"""God save thee, ancient Mariner! From the fiends, that plague thee thus!-- Why look'st thou so?""--With my cross-bow I shot the ALBATROSS. "
26,PART THE SECOND.,"The Sun now rose upon the right: Out of the sea came he, Still hid in mist, and on the left Went down into the sea. "
27,PART THE SECOND.,"And the good south wind still blew behind But no sweet bird did follow, Nor any day for food or play Came to the mariners' hollo! "
28,PART THE SECOND.,"And I had done an hellish thing, And it would work 'em woe: For all averred, I had killed the bird That made the breeze to blow. Ah wretch! said they, the bird to slay That made the breeze to blow! "
29,PART THE SECOND.,"Nor dim nor red, like God's own head, The glorious Sun uprist: Then all averred, I had killed the bird That brought the fog and mist. 'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay, That bring the fog and mist. "
30,PART THE SECOND.,"The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew, The furrow followed free: We were the first that ever burst Into that silent sea. "
31,PART THE SECOND.,"Down dropt the breeze, the sails dropt down, 'Twas sad as sad could be; And we did speak only to break The silence of the sea! "
32,PART THE SECOND.,"All in a hot and copper sky, The bloody Sun, at noon, Right up above the mast did stand, No bigger than the Moon. "
33,PART THE SECOND.,"Day after day, day after day, We stuck, nor breath nor motion; As idle as a painted ship Upon a painted ocean. "
34,PART THE SECOND.,"Water, water, every where, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, every where, Nor any drop to drink. "
35,PART THE SECOND.,"The very deep did rot: O Christ! That ever this should be! Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs Upon the slimy sea. "
36,PART THE SECOND.,"About, about, in reel and rout The death-fires danced at night; The water, like a witch's oils, Burnt green, and blue and white. "
37,PART THE SECOND.,And some in dreams assured were Of the spirit that plagued us so: Nine fathom deep he had followed us From the land of mist and snow. 
38,PART THE SECOND.,"And every tongue, through utter drought, Was withered at the root; We could not speak, no more than if We had been choked with soot. "
39,PART THE SECOND.,"Ah! well a-day! what evil looks Had I from old and young! Instead of the cross, the Albatross About my neck was hung. "
41,PART THE THIRD.,"There passed a weary time.  Each throat Was parched, and glazed each eye. A weary time! a weary time! How glazed each weary eye, When looking westward, I beheld A something in the sky. "
42,PART THE THIRD.,"At first it seemed a little speck, And then it seemed a mist: It moved and moved, and took at last A certain shape, I wist. "
43,PART THE THIRD.,"A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist! And still it neared and neared: As if it dodged a water-sprite, It plunged and tacked and veered. "
44,PART THE THIRD.,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, We could not laugh nor wail; Through utter drought all dumb we stood! I bit my arm, I sucked the blood, And cried, A sail! a sail! "
45,PART THE THIRD.,"With throats unslaked, with black lips baked, Agape they heard me call: Gramercy! they for joy did grin, And all at once their breath drew in, As they were drinking all. "
46,PART THE THIRD.,"See! see! (I cried) she tacks no more! Hither to work us weal; Without a breeze, without a tide, She steadies with upright keel! "
47,PART THE THIRD.,The western wave was all a-flame The day was well nigh done! Almost upon the western wave Rested the broad bright Sun; When that strange shape drove suddenly Betwixt us and the Sun. 
48,PART THE THIRD.,"And straight the Sun was flecked with bars, (Heaven's Mother send us grace!) As if through a dungeon-grate he peered, With broad and burning face. "
49,PART THE THIRD.,"Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud) How fast she nears and nears! Are those her sails that glance in the Sun, Like restless gossameres! "
50,PART THE THIRD.,"Are those her ribs through which the Sun Did peer, as through a grate? And is that Woman all her crew? Is that a DEATH? and are there two? Is DEATH that woman's mate? "
51,PART THE THIRD.,"Her lips were red, her looks were free, Her locks were yellow as gold: Her skin was as white as leprosy, The Night-Mare LIFE-IN-DEATH was she, Who thicks man's blood with cold. "
52,PART THE THIRD.,"The naked hulk alongside came, And the twain were casting dice; ""The game is done!  I've won!  I've won!"" Quoth she, and whistles thrice. "
53,PART THE THIRD.,"The Sun's rim dips; the stars rush out: At one stride comes the dark; With far-heard whisper, o'er the sea. Off shot the spectre-bark. "
54,PART THE THIRD.,"We listened and looked sideways up! Fear at my heart, as at a cup, My life-blood seemed to sip! "
55,PART THE THIRD.,"The stars were dim, and thick the night, The steersman's face by his lamp gleamed white; From the sails the dew did drip-- Till clombe above the eastern bar The horned Moon, with one bright star Within the nether tip. "
56,PART THE THIRD.,"One after one, by the star-dogged Moon Too quick for groan or sigh, Each turned his face with a ghastly pang, And cursed me with his eye. "
57,PART THE THIRD.,"Four times fifty living men, (And I heard nor sigh nor groan) With heavy thump, a lifeless lump, They dropped down one by one. "
58,PART THE THIRD.,"The souls did from their bodies fly,-- They fled to bliss or woe! And every soul, it passed me by, Like the whizz of my CROSS-BOW! "
60,PART THE FOURTH.,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner! I fear thy skinny hand! And thou art long, and lank, and brown, As is the ribbed sea-sand. "
61,PART THE FOURTH.,"""I fear thee and thy glittering eye, And thy skinny hand, so brown.""-- Fear not, fear not, thou Wedding-Guest! This body dropt not down. "
62,PART THE FOURTH.,"Alone, alone, all, all alone, Alone on a wide wide sea! And never a saint took pity on My soul in agony. "
63,PART THE FOURTH.,"The many men, so beautiful! And they all dead did lie: And a thousand thousand slimy things Lived on; and so did I. "
64,PART THE FOURTH.,"I looked upon the rotting sea, And drew my eyes away; I looked upon the rotting deck, And there the dead men lay. "
65,PART THE FOURTH.,"I looked to Heaven, and tried to pray: But or ever a prayer had gusht, A wicked whisper came, and made my heart as dry as dust. "
66,PART THE FOURTH.,"I closed my lids, and kept them close, And the balls like pulses beat; For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky Lay like a load on my weary eye, And the dead were at my feet. "
67,PART THE FOURTH.,"The cold sweat melted from their limbs, Nor rot nor reek did they: The look with which they looked on me Had never passed away. "
68,PART THE FOURTH.,"An orphan's curse would drag to Hell A spirit from on high; But oh! more horrible than that Is a curse in a dead man's eye! Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse, And yet I could not die. "
69,PART THE FOURTH.,"The moving Moon went up the sky, And no where did abide: Softly she was going up, And a star or two beside. "
70,PART THE FOURTH.,"Her beams bemocked the sultry main, Like April hoar-frost spread; But where the ship's huge shadow lay, The charmed water burnt alway A still and awful red. "
71,PART THE FOURTH.,"Beyond the shadow of the ship, I watched the water-snakes: They moved in tracks of shining white, And when they reared, the elfish light Fell off in hoary flakes. "
72,PART THE FOURTH.,"Within the shadow of the ship I watched their rich attire: Blue, glossy green, and velvet black, They coiled and swam; and every track Was a flash of golden fire. "
73,PART THE FOURTH.,"O happy living things! no tongue Their beauty might declare: A spring of love gushed from my heart, And I blessed them unaware: Sure my kind saint took pity on me, And I blessed them unaware. "
74,PART THE FOURTH.,"The self same moment I could pray; And from my neck so free The Albatross fell off, and sank Like lead into the sea. "
76,PART THE FIFTH.,"Oh sleep! it is a gentle thing, Beloved from pole to pole! To Mary Queen the praise be given! She sent the gentle sleep from Heaven, That slid into my soul. "
77,PART THE FIFTH.,"The silly buckets on the deck, That had so long remained, I dreamt that they were filled with dew; And when I awoke, it rained. "
78,PART THE FIFTH.,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold, My garments all were dank; Sure I had drunken in my dreams, And still my body drank. "
79,PART THE FIFTH.,"I moved, and could not feel my limbs: I was so light--almost I thought that I had died in sleep, And was a blessed ghost. "
80,PART THE FIFTH.,"And soon I heard a roaring wind: It did not come anear; But with its sound it shook the sails, That were so thin and sere. "
81,PART THE FIFTH.,"The upper air burst into life! And a hundred fire-flags sheen, To and fro they were hurried about! And to and fro, and in and out, The wan stars danced between. "
82,PART THE FIFTH.,"And the coming wind did roar more loud, And the sails did sigh like sedge; And the rain poured down from one black cloud; The Moon was at its edge. "
83,PART THE FIFTH.,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still The Moon was at its side: Like waters shot from some high crag, The lightning fell with never a jag, A river steep and wide. "
84,PART THE FIFTH.,"The loud wind never reached the ship, Yet now the ship moved on! Beneath the lightning and the Moon The dead men gave a groan. "
85,PART THE FIFTH.,"They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose, Nor spake, nor moved their eyes; It had been strange, even in a dream, To have seen those dead men rise. "
86,PART THE FIFTH.,"The helmsman steered, the ship moved on; Yet never a breeze up blew; The mariners all 'gan work the ropes, Where they were wont to do: They raised their limbs like lifeless tools-- We were a ghastly crew. "
87,PART THE FIFTH.,"The body of my brother's son, Stood by me, knee to knee: The body and I pulled at one rope, But he said nought to me. "
88,PART THE FIFTH.,"""I fear thee, ancient Mariner!"" Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest! 'Twas not those souls that fled in pain, Which to their corses came again, But a troop of spirits blest: "
89,PART THE FIFTH.,"For when it dawned--they dropped their arms, And clustered round the mast; Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths, And from their bodies passed. "
90,PART THE FIFTH.,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound, Then darted to the Sun; Slowly the sounds came back again, Now mixed, now one by one. "
91,PART THE FIFTH.,"Sometimes a-dropping from the sky I heard the sky-lark sing; Sometimes all little birds that are, How they seemed to fill the sea and air With their sweet jargoning! "
92,PART THE FIFTH.,"And now 'twas like all instruments, Now like a lonely flute; And now it is an angel's song, That makes the Heavens be mute. "
93,PART THE FIFTH.,"It ceased; yet still the sails made on A pleasant noise till noon, A noise like of a hidden brook In the leafy month of June, That to the sleeping woods all night Singeth a quiet tune. "
94,PART THE FIFTH.,"Till noon we quietly sailed on, Yet never a breeze did breathe: Slowly and smoothly went the ship, Moved onward from beneath. "
95,PART THE FIFTH.,"Under the keel nine fathom deep, From the land of mist and snow, The spirit slid: and it was he That made the ship to go. The sails at noon left off their tune, And the ship stood still also. "
96,PART THE FIFTH.,"The Sun, right up above the mast, Had fixed her to the ocean: But in a minute she 'gan stir, With a short uneasy motion-- Backwards and forwards half her length With a short uneasy motion. "
97,PART THE FIFTH.,"Then like a pawing horse let go, She made a sudden bound: It flung the blood into my head, And I fell down in a swound. "
98,PART THE FIFTH.,"How long in that same fit I lay, I have not to declare; But ere my living life returned, I heard and in my soul discerned Two VOICES in the air. "
99,PART THE FIFTH.,"""Is it he?"" quoth one, ""Is this the man? By him who died on cross, With his cruel bow he laid full low, The harmless Albatross. "
100,PART THE FIFTH.,"""The spirit who bideth by himself In the land of mist and snow, He loved the bird that loved the man Who shot him with his bow."" "
101,PART THE FIFTH.,"The other was a softer voice, As soft as honey-dew: Quoth he, ""The man hath penance done, And penance more will do."" "
104,FIRST VOICE.,"But tell me, tell me! speak again, Thy soft response renewing-- What makes that ship drive on so fast? What is the OCEAN doing? "
106,SECOND VOICE.,"Still as a slave before his lord, The OCEAN hath no blast; His great bright eye most silently Up to the Moon is cast-- "
107,SECOND VOICE.,"If he may know which way to go; For she guides him smooth or grim See, brother, see! how graciously She looketh down on him. "
109,FIRST VOICE.,"But why drives on that ship so fast, Without or wave or wind? "
111,SECOND VOICE.,"The air is cut away before, And closes from behind. "
112,SECOND VOICE.,"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high Or we shall be belated: For slow and slow that ship will go, When the Mariner's trance is abated. "
113,SECOND VOICE.,"I woke, and we were sailing on As in a gentle weather: 'Twas night, calm night, the Moon was high; The dead men stood together. "
114,SECOND VOICE.,"All stood together on the deck, For a charnel-dungeon fitter: All fixed on me their stony eyes, That in the Moon did glitter. "
115,SECOND VOICE.,"The pang, the curse, with which they died, Had never passed away: I could not draw my eyes from theirs, Nor turn them up to pray. "
116,SECOND VOICE.,"And now this spell was snapt: once more I viewed the ocean green. And looked far forth, yet little saw Of what had else been seen-- "
117,SECOND VOICE.,"Like one that on a lonesome road Doth walk in fear and dread, And having once turned round walks on, And turns no more his head; Because he knows, a frightful fiend Doth close behind him tread. "
118,SECOND VOICE.,"But soon there breathed a wind on me, Nor sound nor motion made: Its path was not upon the sea, In ripple or in shade. "
119,SECOND VOICE.,"It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek Like a meadow-gale of spring-- It mingled strangely with my fears, Yet it felt like a welcoming. "
120,SECOND VOICE.,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship, Yet she sailed softly too: Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze-- On me alone it blew. "
121,SECOND VOICE.,Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed The light-house top I see? Is this the hill? is this the kirk? Is this mine own countree! 
122,SECOND VOICE.,"We drifted o'er the harbour-bar, And I with sobs did pray-- O let me be awake, my God! Or let me sleep alway. "
123,SECOND VOICE.,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass, So smoothly it was strewn! And on the bay the moonlight lay, And the shadow of the moon. "
124,SECOND VOICE.,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less, That stands above the rock: The moonlight steeped in silentness The steady weathercock. "
125,SECOND VOICE.,"And the bay was white with silent light, Till rising from the same, Full many shapes, that shadows were, In crimson colours came. "
126,SECOND VOICE.,"A little distance from the prow Those crimson shadows were: I turned my eyes upon the deck-- Oh, Christ! what saw I there! "
127,SECOND VOICE.,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat, And, by the holy rood! A man all light, a seraph-man, On every corse there stood. "
128,SECOND VOICE.,"This seraph band, each waved his hand: It was a heavenly sight! They stood as signals to the land, Each one a lovely light: "
129,SECOND VOICE.,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand, No voice did they impart-- No voice; but oh! the silence sank Like music on my heart. "
130,SECOND VOICE.,"But soon I heard the dash of oars; I heard the Pilot's cheer; My head was turned perforce away, And I saw a boat appear. "
131,SECOND VOICE.,"The Pilot, and the Pilot's boy, I heard them coming fast: Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy The dead men could not blast. "
132,SECOND VOICE.,"I saw a third--I heard his voice: It is the Hermit good! He singeth loud his godly hymns That he makes in the wood. He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away The Albatross's blood. "
134,PART THE SEVENTH.,This Hermit good lives in that wood Which slopes down to the sea. How loudly his sweet voice he rears! He loves to talk with marineres That come from a far countree. 
135,PART THE SEVENTH.,He kneels at morn and noon and eve-- He hath a cushion plump: It is the moss that wholly hides The rotted old oak-stump. 
136,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The skiff-boat neared: I heard them talk, ""Why this is strange, I trow! Where are those lights so many and fair, That signal made but now?"" "
137,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""Strange, by my faith!"" the Hermit said-- ""And they answered not our cheer! The planks looked warped! and see those sails, How thin they are and sere! I never saw aught like to them, Unless perchance it were "
138,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""Brown skeletons of leaves that lag My forest-brook along; When the ivy-tod is heavy with snow, And the owlet whoops to the wolf below, That eats the she-wolf's young."" "
139,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""Dear Lord! it hath a fiendish look-- (The Pilot made reply) I am a-feared""--""Push on, push on!"" Said the Hermit cheerily. "
140,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The boat came closer to the ship, But I nor spake nor stirred; The boat came close beneath the ship, And straight a sound was heard. "
141,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Under the water it rumbled on, Still louder and more dread: It reached the ship, it split the bay; The ship went down like lead. "
142,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Stunned by that loud and dreadful sound, Which sky and ocean smote, Like one that hath been seven days drowned My body lay afloat; But swift as dreams, myself I found Within the Pilot's boat. "
143,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Upon the whirl, where sank the ship, The boat spun round and round; And all was still, save that the hill Was telling of the sound. "
144,PART THE SEVENTH.,"I moved my lips--the Pilot shrieked And fell down in a fit; The holy Hermit raised his eyes, And prayed where he did sit. "
145,PART THE SEVENTH.,"I took the oars: the Pilot's boy, Who now doth crazy go, Laughed loud and long, and all the while His eyes went to and fro. ""Ha! ha!"" quoth he, ""full plain I see, The Devil knows how to row."" "
146,PART THE SEVENTH.,"And now, all in my own countree, I stood on the firm land! The Hermit stepped forth from the boat, And scarcely he could stand. "
147,PART THE SEVENTH.,"""O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy man!"" The Hermit crossed his brow. ""Say quick,"" quoth he, ""I bid thee say-- What manner of man art thou?"" "
148,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Forthwith this frame of mine was wrenched With a woeful agony, Which forced me to begin my tale; And then it left me free. "
149,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Since then, at an uncertain hour, That agony returns; And till my ghastly tale is told, This heart within me burns. "
150,PART THE SEVENTH.,"I pass, like night, from land to land; I have strange power of speech; That moment that his face I see, I know the man that must hear me: To him my tale I teach. "
151,PART THE SEVENTH.,"What loud uproar bursts from that door! The wedding-guests are there: But in the garden-bower the bride And bride-maids singing are: And hark the little vesper bell, Which biddeth me to prayer! "
152,PART THE SEVENTH.,"O Wedding-Guest! this soul hath been Alone on a wide wide sea: So lonely 'twas, that God himself Scarce seemed there to be. "
153,PART THE SEVENTH.,"O sweeter than the marriage-feast, 'Tis sweeter far to me, To walk together to the kirk With a goodly company!-- "
154,PART THE SEVENTH.,"To walk together to the kirk, And all together pray, While each to his great Father bends, Old men, and babes, and loving friends, And youths and maidens gay! "
155,PART THE SEVENTH.,"Farewell, farewell! but this I tell To thee, thou Wedding-Guest! He prayeth well, who loveth well Both man and bird and beast. "
156,PART THE SEVENTH.,"He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us He made and loveth all. "
157,PART THE SEVENTH.,"The Mariner, whose eye is bright, Whose beard with age is hoar, Is gone: and now the Wedding-Guest Turned from the bridegroom's door. "
158,PART THE SEVENTH.,"He went like one that hath been stunned, And is of sense forlorn: A sadder and a wiser man, He rose the morrow morn. "
