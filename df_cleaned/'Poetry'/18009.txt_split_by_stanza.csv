13,PREFACE.,"A very few of the following pieces appeared in ""Punch,"" during the Consulship of Plancus.  The rest have been written by me during the past twenty-five years, under the signature of ""Arculus,"" for ""The Eagle,"" the Magazine of St. John's College, Cambridge.  I hope their reappearance will be welcome to a few of my old College friends. "
14,PREFACE.,The general reader will probably think that some apology is due to him from me for publishing verses of so crude and trivial a character. 
15,PREFACE.,"I can only say that the smallest of bows should sometimes be unstrung, and that if my little arrows are flimsy and light they will, I trust, wound no one. "

In the original book, they are printed on facing pairs of pages, the left-hand page Latin, the right-hand page English.  In this e-text, each poem is together, and are in the same order as shown in the Table of Contents.] "
22,THE BATTLE OF THE PONS TRIUM TROJANORUM:,"[NOTE.--On Thursday, February 24th, 1881, three Graces were submitted to the Senate of the University of Cambridge, confirming the Report of The Syndicate appointed June 3rd, 1880, to consider four memorials relating to the Higher Education of Women.  The first two Graces were passed by majorities of 398 and 258 against 32 and 26 respectively; the third was unopposed.  The allusions in the following lay will probably be understood only by those who reside in Cambridge; but it may be stated that Professor Kennedy, Professor Fawcett, and Sir C. Dilke gave their votes and influence in favour of The Graces, while Dr. Guillemard, Mr. Wace, Mr. Potts, Professor Lumby, Dr. Perowne, Mr. Horne and Mr. Hamblin Smith voted against The Graces.] "
24,I,"Aemilia Girtonensis, By the Nine Muses swore That the great house of Girton Should suffer wrong no more. By the Muses Nine she swore it, And named a voting day, And bade her learned ladies write, And summon to the impending fight Their masters grave and gay. "
26,II.,"East and West and South and North The learned ladies wrote, And town and gown and country Have read the martial note. Shame on the Cambridge Senator Who dares to lag behind, When light-blue ladies call him To join the march of mind. "
28,III.,"But by the yellow Camus Was tumult and affright: Straightway to Pater Varius The Trojans take their flight-- 'O Varius, Father Varius, 'To whom the Trojans pray, 'The ladies are upon us! 'We look to thee this day!' "
30,IV.,"There be thirty chosen Fellows, The wisest of the land, Who hard by Pater Varius To bar all progress stand: Evening and morn the Thirty On the Three Graces sit, Traced from the left by fingers deft In the great Press of Pitt. "
32,V.,"And with one voice the Thirty Have uttered their decree-- 'Go forth, go forth, great Varius, 'Oppose the Graces Three! 'The enemy already 'Are quartered in the town, 'And if they once the Tripos gain, 'What hope to save the gown?' "
34,VI.,"'To Hiz, [1] the town of Offa, 'Their classes first they led, 'Then onward to Girtonia 'And Nunamantium sped: 'And now a mighty army 'Of young and beardless girls 'Beneath our very citadel 'A banner proud unfurls.' "
36,VII.,"Then out spake Father Varius, No craven heart was his: 'To Pollmen and to Wranglers 'Death comes but once, I wis. 'And how can man live better, 'Or die with more renown, 'Than fighting against Progress 'For the rights of cap and gown?' "
38,VIII.,"'I, with two more to help me, 'Will face yon Graces Three; 'Will guard the Holy Tripod, 'And the M.A. Degree. 'We know that by obstruction 'Three may a thousand foil. 'Now who will stand on either hand 'To guard our Trojan soil?' "
40,IX.,"Then Parvue Mariensis, Of Bearded Jove the Priest, Spake out 'of Trojan warriors 'I am, perhaps, the least, 'Yet will I stand at thy right hand.' Cried Pottius--'I likewise 'At thy left side will stem the tide 'Of myriad flashing eyes. "
42,X.,"Meanwhile the Ladies' Army, Right glorious to behold, Came clad in silks and satins bright, With seal-skins and with furs bedight, And gems and rings of gold. Four hundred warriors shouted 'Placet' with fiendish glee, As that fair host with fairy feet, And smiles unutterably sweet, Came tripping each towards her seat, Where stood the dauntless Three. "
44,XI.,"The Three stood calm and silent, And frowned upon their foes, As a great shout of laughter From the four hundred rose: And forth three chiefs came spurring Before their ladies gay, They faced the Three, they scowled and scoffed, Their gowns they donned, their caps they doffed, Then sped them to the fray. "
46,XII.,"Generalis Post-Magister, Lord of the Letter-bags; And Dilkius Radicalis, Who ne'er in combat lags; And Graecus Professorius, Beloved of fair Sabrine, From the grey Elms--beneath whose shade A hospitable banquet laid, Had heroes e'en of cowards made.-- Brought 'placets' thirty-nine. "
48,XIII,"Stout Varius hurled 'non placet' At Post-Magister's head: At the mere glance of Pottius Fierce Radicalis fled: And Parvus Mariensis-- So they who heard him tell-- Uttered but one false quantity, And Professorius fell! "
51,XIV.,"But fiercer still and fiercer Fresh foemen sought the fray. And fainter still and fainter Stout Varius stood at bay. 'O that this too, too solid Flesh would dissolve,' he sighed; Yet still he stood undaunted, And still the foe defied. "
53,XV.,"Then Pollia Nunamensis, A student sweetly fair, Famed for her smiles and dimples Blue eyes and golden hair, Of Cupid's arrows seized a pair, One in each eye she took: Cupid's best bow with all her might She pulled--each arrow winged its flight, And straightway reason, sense, and sight Stout Varius forsook. "
55,XVI.,"'He falls'--the Placets thundered, And filled the yawning gap; In vain his trusty comrades Avenge their chief's mishap-- His last great fight is done. 'They charge!  Brave Pottius prostrate lies, No Rider helps him to arise: They charge!  Fierce Mariensis dies. The Bridge, the Bridge is won! "
57,XVII.,"In vain did Bencornutus Flash lightnings from his beard; In vain Fabrorum Maximus His massive form upreared; And Lumbius Revisorius-- Diviner potent he!-- And Peronatus robed in state, And fine old Fossilis sedate, All vainly stemmed the tide of fate-- Triumphed the Graces Three! "
59,XVIII.,"But when in future ages Women have won their rights, And sweet girl-undergraduates Read through the lamp-lit nights; When some, now unborn, Pollia Her head with science crams; When the girls make Greek Iambics, And the boys black-currant jams; "
61,XIX.,"When the goodman's shuttle merrily Goes flashing through the loom, And the good wife reads her Plato In her own sequestered room; With weeping and with laughter Still shall the tale be told, How pretty Pollia won the Bridge In the brave days of old. "
66,JULIA.,[NOTE.--The following imitation of Cowper's _Boadicea_ was written in 1858; most of its predictions have since been fulfilled.] 
67,JULIA.,"When the Cambridge flower-show ended, And the flowers and guests were gone, And the evening shades descended, Roamed a man forlorn alone. "
68,JULIA.,Sage beside the River slow Sat the Don renowned for lore And in accents soft and low To the elms his love did pour. 
69,JULIA.,"""Julia, if my learned eyes Gaze upon thy matchless face: 'Tis because I feel there lies Magic in thy lovely grace. "
70,JULIA.,"""I will marry! write that threat In the ink I daily waste: Marry--pay each College debt-- College Ale no more will taste. "
71,JULIA.,"""Granta, far and wide renowned, Frowns upon the married state; Soon her pride shall kiss the ground Hark!  Reform is at the gate. "
72,JULIA.,"""Other Fellows shall arise, Proud to own a husband's name: Proud to own their infants' cries-- Harmony the path to fame. "
73,JULIA.,"""Then the progeny that springs From our ancient College walls, Armed with trumpets, noisy things, Shall astound us by their squalls. "
74,JULIA.,"""Sounds no wrangler yet has heard, Our posterity shall fright: E'en 'the Eagle,' [1] valiant bird, Shall betake itself to flight."" "
75,JULIA.,"Such the thoughts that through him whirl'd Pensively reclining there: Smiling, as his fingers curled His divinely-glowing hair. "
76,JULIA.,"He, with all a lover's pride, Felt his manly bosom glow, Sought the Bull, besought the Bride, All she said was ""No, Sir, No!"" "
77,JULIA.,"Julia, pitiless as cold, Lo the vengeance due from Heaven! College Living he doth hold; Single bliss to thee is given. "
78,JULIA.,"[1] ""The Eagle"" is the well-known Magazine of St. John's College, Cambridge. "
80,CLIO FATIDICA.,"[NOTE.--The following lines were written to celebrate the 'bump' by which the Lady Margaret 1st Boat became ""Head of the River"" in 1871. On the next evening Professor Selwyn delighted the eyes and the hearts of all Johnians by sculling down the river to salute the Head of the River.  The title of _psychroloutes_ [*] needs no explanation to those who know the Selwyns, who are no less renowned as swimmers than as oarsmen.] "
81,CLIO FATIDICA.,"""Tell me, Muse, what colour floateth round the River's ancient head: Is it white and black, or white and blue, is it scarlet, blue, or red?"" Thus I prayed, and Clio answered, ""Why, I thought the whole world knew That the red of Margareta had deposed the flag of blue! Babes unborn shall sing in rapture how, desiring Close [1] affinity, Goldie, rowing nearly fifty, overlapped, and bumped First Trinity. I myself was at the Willows, and beheld the victory won; Saw the victor's final effort, and the deed of daring done. I myself took off my bonnet, and forgetful of my years, Patting Goldie on the shoulder, gave him three times thrice three cheers. Ne'er, oh! ne'er, shall be forgotten the excitement of that night; Aged Dons, deem'd stony-hearted, wept with rapture at the sight: E'en the Master of a College, as he saw them overlap, Shouted 'Well rowed, Lady Margaret,' and took off his College cap; And a Doctor of Divinity, in his Academic garb, Sang a solemn song of triumph, as he lashed his gallant barb; Strong men swooned, and small boys whistled, sympathetic hounds did yell Lovely maidens smiled their sweetest on the men who'd rowed so well: Goldie, Hibbert, Lang, and Bonsey, Sawyer, Burnside, Harris, Brooke; And the pride of knighthood, Bayard, who the right course ne'er forsook, But the sight which most rejoiced me was the well-known form aquatic Of a scholar famed for boating and for witticisms Attic. Proud, I ween, was Lady Margaret her Professor there to view, As with words of wit and wisdom he regaled the conquering crew. Proud, I ween, were Cam and Granta, as they saw once more afloat Their Etonian _psychroloutes_ [*], in his ""Funny"" little boat. Much, I ween, their watery spirits did within their heart's rejoice, As they listened to the music of that deep and mellow voice. Ah! 'tis well, to sing of boating, when before my swimming eyes Baleful visions of the future, woes unutterable rise. All our palmy days are over; for the fairer, feebler sex Has determined every College in succession to annex; And before another decade has elapsed, our eyes shall see College Tutors wearing thimbles o'er convivial cups of tea. For 'golden-haired girl-graduates,' with 'Dowagers for Dons,' Shall tyrannize in Trinity, and domineer in 'John's.' Then, instead of May Term races in the science grand of rowing, There'll be constant competition in the subtle art of sewing. Soon the modern undergraduate, with a feather in her hat, Shall parade the streets of Cambridge, followed by her faithful cat. From Parker's Piece and Former's shall be banished bat and wicket, For crotchet work and knitting shall supplant the game of cricket, Save whene'er a match at croquet once a Term is played at Girton By the Members of ""the College"" and the Moralists of Merton. Then no tandems shall be driven, and no more athletic sports, Save fancy balls and dances, shall appear in ""Field"" reports: And instead of 'pots' and 'pewters' to promote the art of walking, We shall have a silver medal for proficiency in talking. Wranglers fair shall daily wrangle, who no Mathematics ken; Lady preachers fill the pulpit, lady critics wield the pen. O ye gallant, gallant heroes who the River's head have won, Little know ye what an era of confusion hath begun. I myself shall flee from Cambridge, sick at heart and sorely vexed, Ere I see my University disestablished and unsexed.'"" Thus she spake, and I endeavoured to console the weeping Muse: ""Dry your tears, beloved Clio, drive away this fit of blues. Cease your soul with gloomy fancies and forebodings to perplex; You are doing gross injustice to the merits of your sex. Know you not that things are changing, that the Earth regains her youth, Since Philosophers have brought to light the one primeval truth? Long have all things been misgoverned by the foolish race of men, Who've monopolized sword, sceptre, mitre, ermine, spade, and pen, All the failures, all the follies, that the weary world bewails, Have arisen, trust me, simply from the government of males. But a brighter age is dawning; in the circling of the years Lordly woman sees before her new 'ambitions,' new careers; For the world's regeneration instantaneously began, When Philosophers discovered the inferior claims of man. With new honours Alma Mater shall eternally be crowned, When the Ladies march in triumph, and her learned seat surround; Then a nobler race of students, and of athletes shall arise, Students fair who thirst for knowledge, athletes true who 'pots' despise. It is well for thee, sweet Clio, at their harmless tastes to sneer, At their love of cats and croquet, their antipathy to beer; But as soon as every College has surrendered to the fair, Life up here will be perfection, we shall breathe ambrosial air; For the problem of past ages will be solved, and we shall find The superior powers of woman, both in body and in mind. She shall teach us how to study, how to ride, and run, and row; How to box and play at cricket; how the heavy weight to throw; How to shoot the trembling pigeon; how the wily rat to slay; How at football and at racquets; how at whist and chess to play; How to drive the rapid tandem; how to jump, and how to walk; (For young women, trust me, Clio, can do something more than talk) How to climb the Alps in summer; how in winter time to skate; How to hold the deadly rifle; how a yacht to navigate; How to make the winning hazard with an effort sure and strong; How to play the maddening comet, how to sing a comic song; How to 'utilize' Professors; how to purify the Cam; How to brew a sherry cobbler, and to make red-currant jam. All the arts which now we practise in a desultory way Shall be taught us to perfection, when we own the Ladies' sway."" Thus I spake, and strove by speaking to assuage sweet Clio's fears; But she shook her head in sorrow, and departed drowned in tears. "

84,CLIO FATIDICA.,"[*] [Transcriber's note: The word ""psychroloutes"" appears in the original book in Greek.  It has been transliterated from the Greek letters psi, upsilon, chi, rho, omicron, lambda, omicron, upsilon, tau, eta, and sigma.] "
87,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"It was an Undergraduate, his years were scarce nineteen; Discretion's years and wisdom's teeth he plainly ne'er had seen; For his step was light and jaunty, and around him wide and far He puffed the fragrant odours of a casual cigar. "
88,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"It was a sweet girl-graduate, her years were thirty two; Her brow was intellectual, her whole appearance blue; Her dress was mediaeval, and, as if by way of charm, Six volumes strapped together she was bearing 'neath her arm. "
89,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'My beautiful Aesthesis,' the young man rashly cried, 'I am the young Athletes, of Trinity the pride; I have large estates in Ireland, which ere long will pay me rent; I have rooms in Piccadilly, and a farm (unlet) in Kent. "
90,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'My achievements thou hast heard of, how I chalk the wily cue, Pull an oar, and wield the willow, and have won my double-blue; How I ride, and play lawn tennis; how I make a claret cup; Own the sweetest of bull terriers, and a grand St. Bernard pup. "
91,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'But believe me, since I've seen thee, all these pleasures are a bore; Life has now one only object fit to love and to adore; Long in silence have I worshipped, long in secret have I sighed: Tell me, beautiful Aesthesis, wilt thou be my blooming bride?' "
92,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'Sir Student,' quoth the maiden, 'you are really quite intense, And I ever of this honour shall retain the highest sense; But forgive me, if I venture'--faintly blushing thus she spoke-- 'Is not true love inconsistent with tobacco's mundane smoke?' "
93,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'Perish all that comes between us,' cried Athletes, as he threw His weed full fifty paces in the stream of Camus blue: The burning weed encountered the cold river with the hiss Which ensues when fire and water, wranglers old, are forced to kiss. "
94,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'Sir Student, much I thank thee,' said the Lady, 'thou hast shown The fragrance of a lily, or of petals freshly blown; But before to thee I listen there are questions not a few Which demand from thee an answer satisfactory and true.' "
95,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'Fire away,' exclaimed Athletes, 'I will do the best I can; But remember, gentle Maiden, that I'm not a reading man; So your humble servant begs you, put your questions pretty plain, For my Tutors all assure me I'm not overstocked with brain. "
96,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'Sir Student' cried the Lady, and her glance was stern and high, Hast thou felt the soft vibration of a summer sunset sky? Art thou soulful?  Art thou tuneful?  Cans't thou weep o'er nature's woes? Art thou redolent of Ruskin?  Dost thou love a yellow rose? "
97,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'Hast thou bathed in emanations from the canvass of Burne Jones? As thou gazest at a Whistler, doth it whistle wistful tones? Art thou sadly sympathetic with a symphony in blue? Tell me, tell me, gentle Student, art thou really quite tootoo?' "
98,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"''Pon my word,' replied the Student, 'this is coming it too strong: I can sketch a bit at Lecture, and can sing a comic song; But my head with all these subjects 'tis impossible to cram; So, my beautiful Aesthesis, you must take me as I am.' "
99,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"'Wilt thou come into my parlour,' sweetly blushing asked the Maid, 'To my little bower in Girton, where a table shall be laid? Pen and paper I will bring thee, and whatever thou shalt ask, That is lawful, shall be granted for performance of thy task.' "
100,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"Lightly leapt the young Athletes from his seat beside the Cam: 'This is tempting me, by Jingo, to submit to an Exam! So it's time, my learned Lady, you and I should say good-bye'-- And he stood with indignation and wild terror in his eye. "
101,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"They parted, and Athletes had not left her very far, Ere again he puffed the odours of a casual cigar; But he oftentimes lamented, as to manhood's years he grew, 'What a pity such a stunner was so spoilt by being blue!' "
102,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"And Aesthesis, as she watched him with his swinging manly stride, The 'double-blue' Athletes, of Trinity the pride, Found it difficult entirely to eradicate love's dart, As she listened to thy Lecture, Slade Professor of Fine Art. "
103,ATHLETES AND AESTHESIS.,"And Ruskin, and the warblings of Whistler and Burne Jones, And symphonies in colours, and sunset's silent tones, Move her not as once they moved her, for she weeps in sorrow sore, 'O had I loved Athletes less, or he loved culture more!' "
106,A VISION.,"As hard at work I trimmed the midnight lamp, Yfilling of mine head with classic lore, Mine hands firm clasped upon my temples damp, Methought I heard a tapping at the door; 'Come in,' I cried, with most unearthly rore, Fearing a horrid Dun or Don to see, Or Tomkins, that unmitigated bore, Whom I love not, but who alas! loves me, And cometh oft unbid and drinketh of my tea. "
107,A VISION.,"'Come in,' I rored; when suddenly there rose A magick form before my dazzled eyes: 'Or do I wake,' I asked myself 'or doze'? Or hath an angel come in mortal guise'? So wondered I; but nothing mote surmise; Only I gazed upon that lovely face, In reverence yblent with mute surprise: Sure never yet was seen such wondrous grace, Since Adam first began to run his earthlie race. "
108,A VISION.,"Her hands were folded on her bosom meek; Her sweet blue eyes were lifted t'ward the skie; Her lips were parted, yet she did not speak; Only at times she sighed, or seemed to sigh: In all her 'haviour was there nought of shy; Yet well I wis no Son of Earth would dare, To look with love upon that lofty eye; For in her beauty there was somewhat rare, A something that repell'd an ordinary stare. "
109,A VISION.,"Then did she straight a snowycloth disclose Of samite, which she placed upon a chair: Then, smiling like a freshly-budding rose, She gazed upon me with a witching air, As mote a Cynic anchorite ensnare. Eftsoons, as though her thoughts she could not smother, She hasted thus her mission to declare:-- 'Please, these is your clean things I've brought instead of brother, 'And if you'll pay the bill you'll much oblige my mother.' "
112,A MAY TERM MEMORY.,"She wore a sweet pink bonnet, The sweetest ever known: And as I gazed upon it, My heart was not my own. For--I know not why or wherefore-- A pink bonnet put on well, Tho' few other things I care for, Acts upon me like a spell. "
113,A MAY TERM MEMORY.,'Twas at the May Term Races That first I met her eye: Amid a thousand Graces No form with her's could vie. On Grassy's sward enamelled She reigned fair Beauty's Queen; And every heart entrammell'd With the charms of sweet eighteen. 
114,A MAY TERM MEMORY.,"Once more I saw that Bonnet-- 'Twas on the King's Parade-- Once more I gazed upon it, And silent homage paid. She knew not I was gazing; She passed unheeding by; While I, in trance amazing, Stood staring at the sky. "
115,A MAY TERM MEMORY.,"The May Term now is over: That Bonnet has 'gone down'; And I'm myself a rover, Far from my Cap and Gown. But I dread the Long Vacation, And its work by night and day, After all the dissipation Energetic of the May. "
116,A MAY TERM MEMORY.,"For _x_ and _y_ will vanish, When that Bonnet I recall; And a vision fair will banish, Newton, Euclid, and Snowball. And a gleam of tresses golden, And of eyes divinely blue, Will interfere with Holden, And my Verse and Prose imbue. "
118,A MAY TERM MEMORY.,"These sweet girl graduate beauties, With their bonnets and their roses, Will mar ere long the duties Which Granta wise imposes. Who, when such eyes are shining, Can quell his heart's sensations; Or turn without repining To Square Root and Equations? "
119,A MAY TERM MEMORY.,"And when conspicuous my name By absence shall appear; When I have lost all hopes of fame, Which once I held so dear; When 'plucked' I seek a vain relief In plaintive dirge or sonnet; Thou wilt have caused that bitter grief, Thou beautiful Pink Bonnet! "
122,THE MAY TERM.,Mille venit variis florum Dea nexa coronis: Scena ioci morem liberioris habet. 
124,"OV. FAST. IV. 945, 946.","I wish that the May Term were over, That its wearisome pleasures were o'er, And I were reclining in clover On the downs by a wave-beaten shore: For fathers and mothers by dozens, And sisters, a host without end, Are bringing up numberless cousins, Who have each a particular friend. "
125,"OV. FAST. IV. 945, 946.","I'm not yet confirmed in misogyny-- They are all very well in their way-- But my heart is as hard as mahogany, When I think of the ladies in May. I shudder at each railway-whistle, Like a very much victimized lamb; For I know that the carriages bristle With ladies invading the Cam. "
126,"OV. FAST. IV. 945, 946.","Last week, as in due preparation For reading I sported my door, With surprise and no small indignation, I picked up this note on the floor-- 'Dear E. we are coming to see you, 'So get us some lunch if you can; 'We shall take you to Grassy, as Jehu-- 'Your affectionate friend, Mary Ann.' "
127,"OV. FAST. IV. 945, 946.","Affectionate friend!  I'm disgusted With proofs of affection like these, I'm growing 'old, tawny and crusted,' Tho' my nature is easy to please. An Englishman's home is his castle, So I think that my friend Mary Ann Should respect, tho' she deem him her vassal, The rooms of a reading young man. "
128,"OV. FAST. IV. 945, 946.","In the days of our fathers how pleasant The May Term up here must have been! No chignons distracting were present, And scarcely a bonnet was seen. As the boats paddled round Grassy Corner No ladies examined the crews, Or exclaimed with the voice of the scorner-- 'Look, _how_ Mr. Arculus screws!! "
129,"OV. FAST. IV. 945, 946.","But now there are ladies in College, There are ladies in Chapels and Halls; No doubt 'tis a pure love of knowledge That brings them within our old walls; For they talk about Goldie's 'beginning'; Know the meaning of 'finish' and 'scratch,' And will bet even gloves on our winning The Boat Race, Athletics, or Match. "
130,"OV. FAST. IV. 945, 946.","There's nothing but music and dancing, Bands playing on each College green; And bright eyes are merrily glancing Where nothing but books should be seen. They tell of a grave Dean a fable, That reproving an idle young man He faltered, for on his own table He detected in horror--a fan! "
131,"OV. FAST. IV. 945, 946.","Through Libraries, Kitchens, Museums, These Prussian-like Amazons rush, Over manuscripts, joints, mausoleums, With equal intensity gush. Then making their due 'requisition,' From 'the lions' awhile they refrain, And repose in the perfect fruition Of ices, cold fowl, and champagne. "
132,"OV. FAST. IV. 945, 946.","Mr. Editor, answer my question-- When, O when, shall this tyranny cease? Shall the process of mental digestion Ne'er find from the enemy peace? Above all if my name you should guess, Sir, Keep it quite to yourself, if you can; For I dread, more than words can express, Sir, My affectionate friend Mary Ann. "
136,A TRAGEDY OF THE 19TH CENTURY.,"It was a young Examiner, scarce thirty were his years, His name our University loves, honours, and reveres: He pondered o'er some papers, and a tear stood in his eye; He split his quill upon the desk, and raised a bitter cry-- 'O why has Fortune struck me down with this unearthly blow? ""Why doom'd me to examine in my lov'd one's Little-go? ""O Love and Duty, sisters twain, in diverse ways ye pull; ""I dare not 'pass,' I scarce can 'pluck:' my cup of woe is full. ""O that I ever should have lived this dismal day to see""! He knit his brow, and nerved his hand, and wrote the fatal D. "
138,A TRAGEDY OF THE 19TH CENTURY.,"It was a lovely maiden down in Hertford's lovely shire; Before her on a reading-desk, lay many a well-filled quire: The lamp of genius lit her eyes; her years were twenty-two; Her brow was high, her cheek was pale, her bearing somewhat blue: She pondered o'er a folio, and laboured to divine The mysteries of ""_x_"" and ""_y_,"" and many a magic sign: Yet now and then she raised her eye, and ceased awhile to ponder, And seem'd as though inclined to allow her thoughts elsewhere to wander, A step was heard, she closed her book; her heart beat high and fast, As through the court and up the stairs a manly figure passed. One moment more, the opening door disclosed unto her view Her own beloved Examiner, her friend and lover true. ""Tell me, my own Rixator, is it First or Second Class?"" His firm frame shook, he scarce could speak, he only sigh'd ""Alas!"" She gazed upon him with an air serenely calm and proud-- ""Nay, tell me all, I fear it not""--he murmured sadly ""Ploughed."" She clasped her hands, she closed her eyes as fell the word of doom; Full five times round in silence did she pace her little room; Then calmly sat before her books, and sigh'd ""Rixator dear, ""Give me the list of subjects to be studied for next year."" "
139,A TRAGEDY OF THE 19TH CENTURY.,"""My own brave Mathematica, my pupil and my pride, ""My persevering Student whom I destine for my bride; ""Love struggled hard with Duty, while the lover marked you B; ""In the end the stern Examiner prevailed and gave you D. ""Mine was the hand that dealt the blow!  Alas, against my will ""I plucked you in Arithmetic--and can'st thou love me still?""

142,A TRAGEDY OF THE 19TH CENTURY.,"A year had passed, and she had passed, for morning, noon, and night, Her Euclid and her Barnard-Smith had been her sole delight. Soon ""Baccalaurea Artium"" was added to her name, And Hitchin's groves, and Granta's courts resounded with her fame; And when Rixator hurried down one day by the express, And asked if she would have him, I believe she answered ""Yes."" For now they live together, and a wiser, happier pair, More learned and more loving, can scarce be found elsewhere; And they teach their children Euclid, and their babies all can speak French and German in their cradles, and at five can write good Greek; And he is a Professor and she Professoress, And they never cease the Little-go in gratitude to bless; When love could not the Lover from the path of duty sway, And no amount of plucking could his Student fair dismay.

150,"""NUNC TE BACCHE CANAM.""","But thou!--Fool, fool, I thought that thou At least wert something glorious; I saw thy polished ivory brow, And could not feel censorious. I thought I saw thee smile--but that Was all imagination; Upon the garden seat I sat, And gazed in adoration. "
151,"""NUNC TE BACCHE CANAM.""","I plucked a newly-budding rose, Our lips then met together; We spoke not--but a lover knows How lips two lives can tether. We parted!  I believed thee true; I asked for no love-token; But now thy form no more I view-- My Pipe, my Pipe, thou'rt broken! "

176,THE SENIOR FELLOW.,"Soon fresh scenes my fancy people, For I see a wooded hill; See above the well-known steeple; Hear below the well-known rill; Joyous sounds each gale is bringing, Wafted on its fragrant breath; Hark!  I hear young voices singing, Voices silent now in death. "
177,THE SENIOR FELLOW.,"Brothers, sisters, loved and loving, Hold me in their fond embrace; Half forgiving, half reproving, I can see my Mother's face, Mid a night of raven tresses, Through the gloom two sad eyes shine; And my hand a soft hand presses, And a heart beats close to mine. "
178,THE SENIOR FELLOW.,"In mine ears a voice is ringing, Sweeter far than earthly strain, Heavenly consolation bringing From the land that knows no pain, And when slowly from me stealing Fades that vision into air, Every pulse beats with the feeling That a Spirit loved was there. "
180,A VALENTINE.,"O how shall I write a love-ditty To my Alice on Valentine's day? How win the affection or pity Of a being so lively and gay? For I'm an unpicturesque creature, Fond of pipes and port wine and a doze Without a respectable feature, With a squint and a very queer nose. "
181,A VALENTINE.,"But she is a being seraphic, Full of fun, full of frolic and mirth; Who can talk in a manner most graphic Every possible language on earth.

182,A VALENTINE.,She sings--sweeter far than a cymbal (A sound which I never have heard); She plays--and her fingers most nimble Make music more soft than a bird. She speaks--'tis like melody stealing O'er the Mediterranean sea; She smiles--I am instantly kneeling On each gouty and corpulent knee. 
183,A VALENTINE.,"'Tis night! the pale moon shines in heaven (Where else it should shine I don't know), And like fire-flies the Pleiades seven Are winking at mortals below: Let them wink, if they like it, for ever, My heart they will ne'er lead astray; Nor the soft silken memories sever, Which bind me to Alice De Grey.

184,A VALENTINE.,"If I roam thro' the dim Coliseum, Her fairy form follows me there; If I list to the solemn ""Te Deum,"" Her voice seems to join in the prayer. ""Sweet spirit"" I seem to remember, O would she were near me to hum it; As I heard her in sunny September, On the Rigi's aërial summit! "
185,A VALENTINE.,"O Alice where art thou?  No answer Comes to cheer my disconsolate heart; Perhaps she has married a lancer, Or a bishop, or baronet smart; Perhaps, as the Belle of the ball-room, She is dancing, nor thinking of me; Or riding in front of a small groom; Or tossed in a tempest at sea; "
186,A VALENTINE.,"Or listening to sweet Donizetti, In Venice, or Rome, or La Scala; Or walking alone on a jetty; Or buttering bread in a parlour; Perhaps, at our next merry meeting, She will find me dull, married, and gray; So I'll send her this juvenile greeting On the Eve of St. Valentine's day.

188,A CURATE'S COMPLAINT.,"Where are they all departed, The loved ones of my youth, Those emblems white of purity, Sweet innocence and truth? When day-light drives the darkness, When evening melts to night, When noon-day suns burn brightest, They come not to my sight. "
189,A CURATE'S COMPLAINT.,"I miss their pure embraces Around my neck and throat, The thousand winning graces Whereon I used to dote. I know I may find markets Where love is bought and sold, But no such love can equal The tender ties of old. "
190,A CURATE'S COMPLAINT.,"My gentle washer-woman, I know that you are true; The least shade of suspicion Can never fall on you. Then fear me not, as fiercely I fix on thee stern eyes, And ask in terms emphatic, ""Where are my lost white ties?"" "
191,A CURATE'S COMPLAINT.,"Each year I buy a dozen, Yet scarce a year is gone, Ere, looking in my ward-robe, I find that I have none. I don't believe in magic, I know that you are true, Yet say, my washer-woman, What can those white ties do? "
192,A CURATE'S COMPLAINT.,"Does each with her own collar To regions far elope, Regions by starch untainted, And innocent of soap? I know not; but in future I'll buy no more white ties, But wear the stiff 'all-rounder' Of Ritualistic guise. "

261,TURGIDUS ALPINUS.,"My miserable countrymen, whose wont is once a-year To lounge in watering-places, disagreeable and dear; Who on pigmy Cambrian mountains, and in Scotch or Irish bogs Imbibe incessant whisky, and inhale incessant fogs: Ye know not with what transports the mad Alpine Clubman gushes, When with rope and axe and knapsack to the realms of snow he rushes. O can I e'er the hour forget--a voice within cries ""Never!""-- From British beef and sherry _dear_ which my young heart did sever? My limbs were cased in flannel light, my frame in Norfolk jacket, As jauntily I stepped upon the impatient Calais packet. ""Dark lowered the tempest overhead,"" the waters wildly rolled, Wildly the moon sailed thro' the clouds, ""and it grew wondrous cold;"" The good ship cleft the darkness, like an iron wedge, I trow, As the steward whispered kindly, ""you had better go below""-- Enough!  I've viewed with dauntless eye the cattle's bloody tide; Thy horse, proud Duke of Manchester, I've seen straight at me ride; I've braved chance ram-rods from my friends, blank cartridges from foes; The jeers of fair spectators, when I fell upon my nose; I've laughed at toils and troubles, as a British Volunteer; But the thought of that nigh's misery still makes me pale with fear. Sweet the repose which cometh as the due reward of toil; Sweet to the sea-worn traveller the French or British soil; But a railway-carriage full of men, who smoke and drink and spit, Who disgust you by their manners, and oppress you with their wit; A carriage garlic-scented, full of uproar and of heat, To a sleepy, jaded Briton is decidedly not sweet. Then welcome, welcome Paris, peerless city of delights! Welcome, Boulevards, fields Elysian, brilliant days and magic nights! ""Vive la gloire, et vive Napoléon! vive l'Empire (c'est la paix); ""Vive la France, the land of beauty! vive la Rue St. Honoré!"" Wildly shouting thus in triumph, I arrived at my Hotel-- The exterior was palatial, and the dinner pretty well: O'er the rest, ye muses draw a veil!  'Twas the Exhibition year-- And everything was nasty, and proportionately dear, Why should ye sing how much I paid for one poor pint of claret-- The horrors of my bedroom in a flea-frequented garret-- Its non-Sabaean odours--Liliputian devices For washing in a tea-cup--all at ""Exhibition prices?"" To the mountains, to the mountains, to their snowy peaks I fly! For their pure, primeval freshness, for their solitude I sigh! Past old Dijon and its Buffet, past fair Macon and its wine, Thro' the lime-stone cliffs, of Jura, past Mont Cenis' wondrous line; Till at 10 A.M., ""Lake Leman woos me with its crystal face,"" And I take outside the diligence for Chamonix my place. Still my fond imagination views, in memory's mirror clear, Purple rock, and snowy mountain, pine-wood black, and glassy mere; Foaming torrents hoarsely raving; tinkling cowbells in the glade; Meadows green, and maidens mowing in the pleasant twilight shade: The crimson crown of sun-set on Mont Blanc's majestic head, And each lesser peak beneath him pale and ghastly as the dead: Eagle-nest-like mountain chalets, where the tourist for some sous Can imbibe milk by the bucket, and on Nature's grandeur muse: Mont Anvert, the ""Pas"" called ""mauvais,"" which I thought was ""pas mauvais,"" Where, in spite of all my boasting, I encountered some delay; For, much to my amazement, at the steepest part I met A matron who weighed twenty stones, and I think must be there yet: The stupendous Col du Géant, with its chaos of seracs; The procession into Cormayeur, with lantern, rope, and axe: The sweet girl with golden ringlets--her dear name was Mary Ann-- Whom I helped to climb the Jardin, and who cut me at Lausanne: On these, the charms of Chamonix, sweeter far than words can tell, At the witching hour of twilight doth my memory love to dwell. Ye, who ne'er have known the rapture, the unutterable bliss Of Savoy's sequestered valleys, and the mountains of La Suisse; The mosquitos of Martigny; the confusion of Sierre; The dirt of Visp or Minister, and the odours everywhere: Ye, who ne'er from Monte Rosa have surveyed Italia's plain, Till you wonder if you ever will get safely down again; Ye, who ne'er have stood on tip-toe on a 'knife-like snow-arête,' Nor have started avalanches by the pressure of your weight; Ye, who ne'er have _packed_ your weary limbs in sleeping bags at night, Some few inches from a berg-schrund, 'neath the pale moon's freezing light: Who have ne'er stood on the snow-fields, when the sun in glory rose, Nor returned again at sun-set with parched lips and skinless nose; Ye, who love not masked crevasses, falling stones, and blistered feet, Sudden changes from Siberia's cold to equatorial heat; Ye, who love not the extortions of Padrone, Driver, Guide; Ye, who love not o'er the Gemmi on a kicking mule to ride; You miserable creatures, who will never know true bliss, You're not the men for Chamonix; avoid, avoid La Suisse!

My well-worn knapsack to my back I strap; My Alpine rope I neatly round me wrap; Then, axe in hand, the diligence disdaining, I walk to Chamonix, by way of training. Arrived at Coutlet's Inn by eventide, I interview my porter and my guide: My guide, that Mentor who has dragg'd full oft These aching, shaking, quaking limbs aloft; Braved falling stones, cut steps on ice-slopes steep, That _I_ the glory of _his_ deeds might reap. My porter, who with uncomplaining back O'er passes, peaks, and glaciers bears my pack: Tho' now the good man looks a trifle sadder, When I suggest the ill-omened name of ""ladder."" O'er many a pipe our heads we put together; Our first enquiry is of course ""the weather."" With buoyant hearts the star-lit heaven we view; Then our next point is ""What are we to '_do_'?"" My pipe I pocket, and with head up-tossed My listening followers I thus accost:-- ""Mont Blanc, we know, is stupid, stale, and slow, A tiresome tramp o'er lumps of lifeless snow. The Col du Géant is a trifle worse; The Jardin's fit for babies with their nurse: The Aiguille Verte is more the sort of thing, But time has robbed it of its former sting; Alone the Dent du Géant and the Dru [1] Remain 'undone,' and therefore fit to '_do_.' Remember how I love, my comrades tried, To linger on some rocky mountain's side, ""Where I can hear the crash of falling stones, Threatening destruction to the tourist's bones! No cadence falls so sweetly on my ear As stones discharged from precipices sheer: No sight is half so soothing to my nerves As boulders bounding in eccentric curves. If falling stones sufficient be not found, Lead me where avalanches most abound. Ye shake your heads; ye talk of home and wife, Of babes dependent on the Father's life. What! still reluctant? let me then make clear The duties of the guide and mountaineer; Mine is to order, yours is to obey-- For you are hirelings, and 'tis I who pay. I've heard, indeed, that some old-fashioned Herren, Who've walked with Almer, Melchior, and Perren, Maintain that mountaineering is a pleasure, A recreation for our hours of leisure: 'To be or not to be' perhaps may matter To _them_, for they may have some brains to scatter; But _we_, I trust, shall take a higher view, And make our mountain motto 'die or do.' ""Nay, hear me out! your scruples well I know: Trust me, not unrewarded shall ye go. If ye succeed, much money will I give, And mine unfaltering friendship, while ye live. Nor only thus will I your deeds requite; High testimonials in your books I'll write. Thee, trusty guide, will I much eulogize As strong and cautious, diligent and wise, Active, unhesitating, cheerful, sure-- Nay, _almost_ equal to an Amateur! And thou, my meekest of meek beasts of burden, Thou too shalt have thine undisputed guerdon: I'll do for thee the very best I can, And sound thy praise as 'a good third-rate man.' But if ye fail, if cannonading stones, Or toppling ice-crag, pulverize your bones; O happy stroke, that makes immortal heroes Of men who, otherwise, would be but zeroes! What tho' no Alpine horn make music drear O'er the lone snow which furnishes your bier; Nor Alpine maiden strew your grave with posies Of gentian, edelweiss, and Alpine roses? ""The Alpine Muse her iciest tears shall shed, And 'build a stone-man' o'er your honour'd head, Chamois and bouquetins the spot shall haunt, With eagles, choughs, and lammergeyers gaunt; The mountain marmots, marching o'er the snow, Their yearly pilgrimage shall ne'er forego; Tyndall himself, in grand, prophetic tones, Shall calculate the movement of your bones; And your renown shall live serene, eternal, Embalmed in pages of the Alpine Journal!"" "
283,THE MODERN CLIMBER.,"By reasoning such as this, year after year, I overcome my men's unreasoning fear: Twice has my guide by falling stones been struck, Yet still I trust his science and my luck. A falling stone once cut my rope in twain; We stopped to mend it, and marched on again. Once a big boulder, with a sudden whack, Severed my knapsack from my porter's back. Twice on a sliding avalanche I've slid, While my companions in its depths were hid. Daring all dangers, no disaster fearing, I carry out my plan of mountaineering. Thus have I conquered glacier, peak, and pass, Aiguilles du Midi, Cols des Grandes Jorasses. Thus shall I onward march from peak to peak, Till there are no new conquests left to seek. O the wild joy, the unutterable bliss To hear the coming avalanche's hiss! Or place oneself in acrobatic pose, While mountain missiles graze one's sun-burnt nose! And if some future season I be doom'd To be by boulders crushed, or snow entombed, Still let me upward urge my mad career, And risk my limbs and life for honour dear! Sublimely acquiescent in my lot, I'll die a martyr for--I know not what! "
287,THE CLIMBER'S DREAM.,"I made an ascent of the Eiger Last year, which has ne'er been surpassed; 'Twas dangerous, long, and laborious, But almost incredibly fast. We started at twelve from the Faulberg; Ascended the Monch by the way; And were well at the base of our mountain, As the peak caught the dawn of the day. "
288,THE CLIMBER'S DREAM.,"In front of me Almer and Perren Cut steps, each as big as a bucket; While behind me there followed, as Herren, George, Stephen, and Freshfield, and Tuckett. We got to the top without trouble; There halted, of course, for the view; When clouds, sailing fast from the southward, Veiled over the vault of dark blue. "
289,THE CLIMBER'S DREAM.,"The lightning shone playfully round us; The thunder ferociously growled; The hail beat upon us in bullets; And the wind everlastingly howled. We turned to descend to the Scheideck, Eyes blinded, ears deafened, we ran, In our panic and hurry, forgetting To add a new stone to the _man_. "
290,THE CLIMBER'S DREAM.,"Palinurus himself--that is Almer-- No longer could make out the track; 'Twas folly, no doubt, to go onward; 'Twas madness, of course, to go back. The snow slope grew steeper and steeper; The lightning more vividly flared; The thunder rolled deeper and deeper; And the wind more offensively blared. "
291,THE CLIMBER'S DREAM.,"But at last a strong gust for a moment Dispersed the thick cloud from our sight, And revealed an astonishing prospect, Which filled not our hearts with delight: On our right was a precipice awful; On the left chasms yawning and deep; Glazed rocks and snow-slopes were before us, At an angle alarmingly steep. "
292,THE CLIMBER'S DREAM.,"We all turned and looked back at Almer. Who then was the last on the rope; His face for a moment was clouded, Then beamed with the dawn of a hope; He came to the front, and thence forward In wonderful fashion he led, Over rocks, over snow-slopes glissading, While he stood, bolt upright on his head! "
293,THE CLIMBER'S DREAM.,"We followed, in similar fashion; Hurrah, what a moment is this! What a moment of exquisite transport! A realization of bliss! To glissade is a pleasant sensation, Of which all have written, or read; But to taste it, _in perfect perfection_, You should learn to glissade _on your head_. "
294,THE CLIMBER'S DREAM.,"Hurrah! with a wild scream of triumph, Over snow, over boulders we fly, Our heads firmly pressed to the surface, Our heels pointing up to the sky! We bound o'er the bergschrund uninjured, We shoot o'er a precipice sheer; Hurrah, for the modern glissader! Hurrah, for the wild mountaineer! "
296,THE CLIMBER'S DREAM.,"But, alas! what is this? what a shaking! What a jar! what a bump! what a thump! Out of bed, in intense consternation, I bound with a hop, skip, and jump. For I hear the sweet voice of a ""person"" Of whom I with justice am proud, ""_My dear, when you dream about mountains, I wish you'd not jodel so loud!_"" "
298,THE BEACONSFIELD ALPHABET.,"A's my new policy called Annexation; B is the Bother it causes the nation. C is Lord Chelmsford, engaged with Zulus; D the Disasters which give me 'the blues.'

U's my Utopia--Cyprus, I mean: V is Victoria, my Empress and Queen. W's the World, which ere long I shall own; X is the sign of my power unknown. Y is the Yacht I shall keep in the Red Sea: Z the Zulus, whom I wish in the Dead Sea. "
301,THE GLADSTONE ALPHABET.,"A's Aristides, or Gladstone the Good; B is Lord B., whom I'd crush if I could. C are Conservatives, full of mad pranks; D are the Dunces who fill up their ranks. E stands for Ewelme, of some notoriety; F for the Fuss made in Oxford society. G stands for Gladstone, a hewer of wood; H is my Hatchet of merciless mood.

306,O BEATA SOLITUDO; O SOLA BEATITUDO.,"Sweet Solitude where dost thou linger? When and where shall I look in thy face? Feel the soft magic touch of thy finger, The glow of thy silent embrace? Stern Civilization has banished Thy charms to a region unknown; The spell of thy beauty has vanished-- Sweet Solitude, where hast thou flown? "
307,O BEATA SOLITUDO; O SOLA BEATITUDO.,"I have sought thee on pampas and prairie, By blue lake and bluer crevasse, On shores that are arid and airy, Lone peak, and precipitous pass. I have sought thee, sweet Solitude, ever Regardless of peril and pain; But in spite of my utmost endeavour I have sought thee, fair charmer, in vain. "
308,O BEATA SOLITUDO; O SOLA BEATITUDO.,"To the Alps, to the Alps in September, Unconducted by Cook, did I rush; Full well even now I remember How my heart with emotion did gush. Here at least in these lonely recesses With thee I shall cast in my lot; Shall feel thy endearing caresses, Forgetting all else and forgot. "
309,O BEATA SOLITUDO; O SOLA BEATITUDO.,"But I met a young couple ""proposing"" On the top of the sunny Languard; I surprised an old gentleman dozing, ""Times"" in hand, on the heights of Fort Bard. In the fir woods of sweet Pontresina Picnic papers polluted the walks; On the top of the frosty Bernina I found a young mountain of--corks. "
310,O BEATA SOLITUDO; O SOLA BEATITUDO.,"I trod, by the falls of the Handeck, On the end of a penny cigar; As I roamed in the woods above Landeck A hair-pin my pleasure did mar: To the Riffel in vain I retreated, Mr. Gaze and the Gazers were there; On the top of the Matterhorn seated I picked up a lady's back hair! "
311,O BEATA SOLITUDO; O SOLA BEATITUDO.,"From the Belle Vue in Thun I was hunted By ""'Arry"" who wished to play pool; On the Col du Bonhomme I confronted The whole of a young ladies' school. At Giacomo's Inn in Chiesa I was asked to take shares in a mine; With an agent for ""Mappin's new Razor"" I sat down at Baveno to dine. "
312,O BEATA SOLITUDO; O SOLA BEATITUDO.,"On the waves of Lake Leman were floating Old lemons (imagine my feelings!), The fish in Lucerne were all gloating On cast-away salads and peelings; And egg-shells and old bones of chicken On the shore of St. Moritz did lie: My spirit within me did sicken-- Sweet Solitude, where shall I fly? "
313,O BEATA SOLITUDO; O SOLA BEATITUDO.,"Disconsolate, gloomy, and undone I take in the ""Dilly"" my place; By Zurich and Basel to London I rush, as if running a race. My quest and my troubles are over; As I drive through the desolate street To my Club in Pall Mall, I discover Sweet Solitude's summer retreat. "
317,DURING A LATE FELLOWSHIP EXAMINATION.,"Woe, woe is me! for whither can I fly? Where hide me from Mathesis' fearful eye? Where'er I turn the Goddess haunts my path, Like grim Megoera in revengeful wrath: In accents wild, that would awake the dead, Bids me perplexing problems to unthread; Bids me the laws of _x_ and _y_ to unfold, And with ""dry eyes"" dread mysteries behold. Not thus, when blood maternal he had shed, The Furies' fangs Orestes wildly fled; Not thus Ixion fears the falling stone, Tisiphone's red lash, or dark Cocytus' moan. Spare me, Mathesis, though thy foe I be, Though at thy altar ne'er I bend the knee, Though o'er thy ""Asses' Bridge"" I never pass, And ne'er in this respect will prove an ass; Still let mild mercy thy fierce anger quell! oh Let, let me live to be a Johnian fellow! "
319,DURING A LATE FELLOWSHIP EXAMINATION.,"She hears me not! with heart as hard as lead, She hurls a Rhombus at my luckless head. Lo, where her myrmidons, a wrangling crew, With howls and yells rise darkling to the view. There Algebra, a maiden old and pale, Drinks ""double _x_,"" enough to drown a whale. There Euclid, 'mid a troop of ""Riders"" passes, Riding a Rhomboid o'er the Bridge of Asses; And shouts to Newton, who seems rather deaf, I've crossed the Bridge in safety Q.E.F. There black Mechanics, innocent of soap, Lift the long lever, pull the pulley's rope, Coil the coy cylinder, explain the fear Which makes the nurse lean slightly to her rear; Else, equilibrium lost, to earth she'll fall, Down will come child, nurse, crinoline and all! But why describe the rest? a motley crew, Of every figure, magnitude, and hue: Now circles they describe; now form in square; Now cut ellipses in the ambient air: Then in my ear with one accord they bellow, ""Fly wretch! thou ne'er shalt be a Johnian Fellow!"" "
320,DURING A LATE FELLOWSHIP EXAMINATION.,"Must I then bid a long farewell to ""John's,"" Its stately courts, its wisdom-wooing Dons, Its antique towers, its labyrinthine maze, Its nights of study, and its pleasant days? O learned Synod, whose decree I wait, Whose just decision makes, or mars my fate; If in your gardens I have loved to roam, And found within your courts a second home; If I have loved the elm trees' quivering shade, Since on your banks my freshman limbs I laid; If rustling reeds make music unto me More soft, more sweet than mortal melody; If I have loved to ""urge the flying ball"" Against your Racquet Court's re-echoing wall; If, for the honour of the Johnian red, I've gladly spurned the matutinal bed, And though at rowing, woe is me! no dab, I've rowed my best, and seldom caught a crab; If classic Camus flow to me more dear Than yellow Tiber, or Ilissus clear; If fairer seem to me that fragrant stream Than Cupid's kiss, or Poet's pictured dream; If I have loved to linger o'er the page Of Roman Bard, and Academian sage; If all your grave pursuits, your pastimes gay, Have been my care by night, my joy by day; Still let me roam, unworthy tho' I be, By Cam's slow stream, beneath the old elm tree; Still let me lie in Alma Mater's arms, Far from the wild world's troubles and alarms: Hear me, nor in stern wrath my prayer repel! oh Let, let me live to be a Johnian Fellow!

325,"4. SMITH, JASON.          8. FISHER, J.","Eight B.A.'s stout from town came out M.A. degrees to take, And made a vow from stroke to bow a bump or two to make. Weary were they and jaded with the din of London town, And they felt a tender longing for their long-lost cap and gown. So they sought the old Loganus: well pleased, I trow, was he, The manly forms he knew so well once more again to see: And they cried--""O old Loganus, can'st thou find us e'er a boat, In which our heavy carcases may o'er the waters float?"" Then laughed aloud Loganus--a bitter jest lov'd he-- And he cried ""Such heavy mariners I ne'er before did see; I have a fast commodious barge, drawn by a wellfed steed, 'Twill scarcely bear your weight, I fear: for never have I see'd Eight men so stout wish to go out a rowing in a 'height;' Why, gentlemen, a man of war would sink beneath your weight."" Thus spake the old Loganus, and he laughed both long and loud, And when the eight men heard his words, they stood abashed and cowed; For they knew not that he loved them, and that, sharply tho' he spoke, The old man loved them kindly, tho' he also loved his joke: For Loganus is a Trojan, and tho' hoary be his head, He loveth Margareta, and the ancient Johnian red. So he brought them out an eight-oar'd tub, and oars both light and strong, And bade them be courageous, and row their ship along. Then in jumped Casa Minor, the Captain of our crew, And the gallant son-of Fergus in a ""blazer"" bright and new; And _Thomas o Kulindon_ [*] full proudly grasped his oar, And _Iason o Chalkourgos_ [*], who weighs enough for ""four;"" For if Jason and Medea had sailed with him for cargo, To the bottom of the Euxine would have sunk the good ship Argo. Then Pallidulus Bargaeus, the mightiest of our crew, Than whom no better oarsman ever wore the Cambridge blue. And at number six sat Peter, whom Putney's waters know; Number seven was young Josephus, the ever-sleepless Joe; Number eight was John Piscator, at his oar a wondrous dab, Who, tho' all his life a fisher, yet has never caught a crab; Last of all the martial Modius, having laid his good sword by, Seized the rudder-strings, and uttered an invigorating cry: ""Are you ready all?  Row, Two, a stroke!  Eyes front, and sit at ease! Quick March!  I meant to say, Row on! and mind the time all, please."" Then sped the gallant vessel, like an arrow from a bow, And the men stood wondering on the banks to see the ""Old'uns"" row; And Father Camus raised his head, and smiled upon the crew, For their swing, and time, and feather, and their forms, full well he knew. They rowed past Barnwell's silvery pool, past Charon's gloomy bark, And nearly came to grief beneath the railway rafters dark: But down the willow-fringed Long Reach so fearful was their pace, That joyous was each Johnian, and pale each foeman's face. They rowed round Ditton corner, and past the pleasant Plough, Nor listened to the wild appeal for beer that came from bow; They rowed round Grassy Corner, and its fairy forms divine, But from the boat there wandered not an eye of all the nine; They rowed round First-Post Corner, the Little Bridge they passed, And calmly took their station two places from the last. Off went the gun! with one accord the sluggish Cam they smote, And were bumped in fifty seconds by the Second Jesus Boat. "

331,IN CAMUM.,"Ridicula nuper cymba, sicut meus est mos, Flumineas propter salices et murmura Cami, Multa movens mecum, fumo inspirante, iacebam. Illic forte mihi senis occurrebat imago Squalida, torva tuens, longos incompta capillos; Ipse manu cymbam prensans se littore in udo Deposuit; Camique humeros agnoscere latos Immanesque artus atque ora hirsuta videbar: Mox lacrymas inter tales dedit ore querelas-- ""Nate,"" inquit, ""tu semper enim pius accola Cami, Nate, patris miserere tui, miserere tuorum! Quinque reportatis tumet Isidis unda triumphis: Quinque anni videre meos sine laude secundo Cymbam urgere loco cunctantem, et cedere victos. Heu! quis erit finis?  Quis me manet exitus olim? Terga boum tergis vi non cedentia nostri Exercent iuvenes; nuda atque immania crura, Digna giganteas inter certare palaestras, Quisque ferunt, latosque humeros et brachia longa, Collaque Atlanteo non inferiora labore: ""Sed vis arte carens frustrà per stagna laborat: Fit brevis inque dies brevior (proh dedecus ingens!)

Ah! ubi, laeva mei novit quem fluminis ora, Ile 'Ictus,' vitreis longe spectandus ocellis, Dulce decus Cami, quem plebs ignoblis 'Aulam,' Vulpicanem Superi grato cognomine dicunt? Te quoque, magne Pales, et te mea flumina deflent O formose puer, quibus alto in gurgite mersis Mille dedit, rapuit mille oscula candida Naias?

Sed vos, O juvenes, sanguis quibus integer aevi, Spes ventura domus, Grantaeque novissima proles, Antiquum revocate decus, revocate triumphos! Continuo Palinurus ubi 'iam pergite' dixit Erectum librate caput; nec pandere crura Parcite, nec solidis firmi considere transtris!

Tunc ego arundinea redimitus tempora vitta Antiquo fruar imperior iustisque triumphis: Tum demum Cloacina meos foedissima fluctus Desierit temerare, et puro flumine labens Camus ad Oceanum volvetur amabilis amnis.""

335,FATHER CAMUS.,"Smoking lately in my ""Funny,"" as I'm wont, beneath the bank, Listening to Cam's rippling murmurs thro' the weeds and willows dank, As I chewed the Cud of fancy, from the water there appeared An old man, fierce-eyed, and filthy, with a long and tangled beard; To the oozy shore he paddled, clinging to my Funny's nose, Till, in all his mud majestic, Cam's gigantic form arose. Brawny, broad of shoulders was he, hairy were his face and head, And amid loud lamentations tears incessantly he shed. ""Son,"" he cried, ""the sorrows pity of thy melancholy sire! Pity Camus! pity Cambridge! pity our disasters dire! Five long years hath Isis triumphed, five long years have seen my Eight Rowing second, vainly struggling 'gainst an unrelenting fate. What will be the end, I know not! what will be the doom of Camus? Shall I die disowned, dishonoured?  Shall I live, and yet be famous? Backs as strong as oxen have we, legs Herculean and bare, Legs that in the ring with Titan wrestler might to wrestle dare. Arms we have long, straight, and sinewy, Shoulders broad, necks thick and strong, Necks that to the earth-supporting Atlas might full well belong. ""But our strength un-scientific strives in vain thro' stagnant water, Every day, I blush to own it, Cambridge strokes are rowing shorter. With a short spasmodic impulse see the boats a moment leap, Starting with a flying motion, soon they stop and sink to sleep. Where are Stanley, Jones, and Courage? where is 'Judas' stout and tall, Where the Stroke named ''all' by Bargemen, known to Cambridge as 'Jack Hall'? 'Twas a spectacle to see him in his gig-lamps row along, And the good ship speeding onward swift as Poet's gushing song. Where is Paley?  Where is Fairbairn, from whose lips the Naiads dank Snatched and gave their sweetest kisses when our Eight at Chiswick sank? What avails it to remember brilliant days now lost in night? What avails it Putney's annals, and past glories to recite? ""Lost is Granta, lost our glory, lost our former pride of place, Gone are all my blushing honours, nought is left me but disgrace. For regardless of all science, every oarsman now obeys Wild, new fangled laws and notions, never dream'd of in old days. But do you, my gentle Freshmen, who have youth in every vein, Labour by your manly valour our lost laurels to regain! When you hear the Cox'n's 'row on all,' then keep erect your head; Then be your arms and bodies with one motion for'ard sped: Sit firm upon your cushions all; and, when the oar is in, With one harmonious action let your work at once begin: Press your feet against the stretcher, and your legs with vigour ply, Till the ship, as swift as lightning, thro' the yielding water fly. ""He who 'misses the beginning' makes his comrades all to suffer, Spoils the swing, and is a nuisance; turn him out, for he's a duffer! Having made a good beginning you must carry on the work, And until the stroke is finished not an atom must you shirk. I have seen--no names I mention--certain oarsmen with a dash Plunge their oars into the water, and produce a sudden splash! But the middle and the finish are all wasted in the air, And no human constitution can such toil incessant bear; For although the ship at starting may at once its distance clear, And victory seem certain, when the winning post is near, The crew worn out and breathless have nothing in them left, And though pluck may ne'er desert them, of their vigour are bereft. "
336,FATHER CAMUS.,"""And do you, my Palinuris, steering straight the gallant bark, By voice and exhortation keep your heroes to the mark. Cheer the plucky, chide the cowards who to do their work are loth, And forbid them to grow torpid by indulging selfish sloth. Fool!  I know my words are idle! yet if any love remain; If my honour be your glory, my discredit be your pain; If a spark of old affection in your hearts be still alive! Rally round old Father Camus, and his glories past revive! Then adorned with reedy garland shall I take my former throne, And, victor of proud Isis, reign triumphant and alone. Then no more shall Cloacina with my streams her offerings blend, And old Camus clear as crystal to the ocean shall descend!"" "
337,FATHER CAMUS.,"He spoke, and 'neath the surface, black as pitch, he hid his head, And, punting out my Funny, I my homeward journey sped. But a strange ambrosial odour, as the God sank 'neath the flood, Seem'd to float and hover round me, creeping upward from the mud: And for ever from the water's troubled face there seem'd to rise A melancholy fragrance of dead dogs unto the skies. "
339,IN MEMORIAM G. A. P.,"He has gone to his grave in the strength of youth, While life shone bright before him; And we, who remember his worth and truth, Stand vainly grieving o'er him. "
340,IN MEMORIAM G. A. P.,"He has gone to his grave; that manly heart No more with life is glowing; And the tears to our eyes unbidden start, Our sad hearts' overflowing. "
341,IN MEMORIAM G. A. P.,"I gaze on his rooms as beneath I pace, And the past again comes o'er me, For I feel his grasp, and I see his face, And his voice has a welcome for me. "
342,IN MEMORIAM G. A. P.,"I gaze on the river, and see once more His form in the race competing; And I hear the time of his well-known oar, And the shouts his triumph greeting. "
343,IN MEMORIAM G. A. P.,"Flow on, cold river!  Our bitter grief No tears from thy waves can waken: Thy whisp'ring reed, and thy willow leaf By no sad sighs are shaken. "
344,IN MEMORIAM G. A. P.,"Thy banks are thronged by the young and gay, Who dream not of the morrow; No ear hast thou for a mournful lay, No sympathy with sorrow. "
345,IN MEMORIAM G. A. P.,"Flow on, dull river!  Thy heedless wave, As it echoes shouts of gladness, Bears forms as stalwart, and hearts as brave, As his whom we mourn in sadness. "
346,IN MEMORIAM G. A. P.,"But an arm more strong, and a heart more bold, And with purer feelings glowing, Thy flowing waters shall ne'er behold, Till time has ceased from flowing. "
349,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"Let penny-a-liners columns pour Of turgid efflorescence, Describe in language that would floor Our Cayleys, Rouths, and Besants, How Oxford oars as levers move, While Cambridge mathematics, Though excellent in theory, prove Unstable in aquatics. "
350,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"Our muse, a maiden ne'er renowned For pride, or self-reliance, Knows little of the depths profound Of ""Telegraphic"" science: But now her peace she cannot hold And like a true Camena, With look half-blushing and half-bold, Descends into the arena. "
351,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"Sing who was he that steered to win, In spite of nine disasters, And proved that men who ne'er give in Must in the end be masters? No warrior stern by land or sea, With spurs, cocked hat, and sword on, Has weightier work than fell to thee, Our gallant little Gordon. "
352,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"Who when old Cam was almost dead, His glory almost mouldy, Replaced the laurels on his head? Sweet Echo answers--""Goldie."" Who was our Seven of mighty brawn As valiant as a lion? Who could he be but strapping Strachan, Australia's vigorous scion? "
353,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"Who rowed more fierce than lioness, Bereft of all her whelps? A thousand light-blue voices bless The magic name of Phelps. Who was our Five?  Herculean Lowe, (Not he of the Exchequer), So strong, that he with ease could row A race in a three-decker. "
354,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"Cam sighed--""When _shall_ I win a race""? Fair Granta whispered--""When, Sir, You see at Four, his proper place, My Faerie-queen-like Spencer."" 'Tis distance robes the mountain pale In azure tints of bright hue, 'More than a distance' lends to Dale, His well earned double light-blue. "
355,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"Proud Oxford burnt in days of old Ridley the Cambridge Martyr, But this year in our Ridley bold Proud Oxford caught a Tartar. And Randolph rowed as well beseemed His school renowned in story, And like old Nelson only dreamed Of Westminster and glory. "
356,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"These men of weight rowed strong and straight, And led from start to finish; Their slow and steady thirty-eight No spurts could e'er diminish: Till Darbyshire, not given to lose, Sees Cambridge rowing past him; And Goldie steps into his shoes; Long may their leather last him! "
357,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"Glory be theirs who've won full well The love of Alma Mater, The smiles of every light-blue Belle, The shouts of every Pater! Unlimited was each man's store Of courage, strength, and fettle, From Goldie downwards every oar Was ore of precious metal. "
358,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"Then fare-ye-well till this time year, Ye heroes stout and strapping, And then beware, forgive my fear, Lest Oxford find you napping; And, oh! when o'er your work ye bend, 'Mid shouts of--""light-blue's winning,"" If ye would triumph in the end, Remember the beginning! "
359,GRANTA VICTRIX.,"P.S. The Muse true to her sex, Less to be blamed than pitied, A Post-script must of course annex To state a point omitted. When Granta glorying in success With Camus pours her orisons; One name she gratefully must bless, That name is mighty Morrison's. "
361,THE GREAT BOAT-RACE.,"1. HAWKSHAW   3rd Trinity.       5. KINGLAKE     3rd Trinity. 2. PIGOTT     Corpus.            6. BORTHWICK    1st Trinity. 3. WATSON     Pembroke.          7. STEAVENSON   Trinity Hall. 4. HAWKINS    Lady Margaret.     8. SELWYN       3rd Trinity. Steerer, ARCHER, Corpus. "
363,BEFORE THE RACE.,"Come, list to me, who wish to hear the glories of our crew, I'll tell you all the names of those who wear the Cambridge Blue. First HAWKSHAW comes, a stalwart bow, as tough as oak, nay tougher; Look at him ye who wish to see the Antipodes to ""duffer."" Swift as the Hawk in airy flight, strong as the guardsman SHAW, We men of mortal muscles must contemplate him with awe. Though I dwell by Cam's slow river, and I hope am not a bigot, I think that Isis cannot boast a better man than PIGOTT: Active, and strong, and steady, and never known to shirk, Of Corpus the quintessence, he is always fit for work. The men of Thames will be amazed when they see our ""Three"" so strong, And doubt if such a mighty form to mortal mould belong. ""_What son_ is this?"" they, one and all, will ask in awe and wonder; The men of Cam will answer make, ""A mighty son of thunder."" Next HAWKINS comes at ""number 4,"" the sole surviving pet Of the patroness of rowing, the Lady Margaret; When they think of his broad shoulders, and strong and sinewy arms, Nor parents dear, nor brothers stern, need foster fond alarms. O! a tear of love maternal in Etona's eye will quiver When she sees her favourate KINGLAKE also monarch of the river. Oh! that I could honour fitly in this unassuming song That wondrous combination of steady, long, and strong. Then comes a true-blue mariner from the ever-glorious ""First,"" In the golden arms of Glory and the lap of Victory nurst; Though blue may be his colours, there are better oarsmen few, And Oxford when it sees him will perhaps look still more blue. Then comes the son of STEPHEN, as solid as a wall; We need not add, who know his name, that he hails from Trinity Hall. Oh! in the race, when comes at last the struggle close and dire, May he have the wind and courage of his tutor and his sire; May he think of all the glories of the ribbon black and white, And add another jewel to the diadem so bright! Then comes a name which Camus and Etona know full well A name that's always sure to win and ne'er will prove a sell. O what joy will fill a Bishop's heart oft a far far distant shore, When he sees our Stroke; reviving the memories of yore! Then old Cam will he revisit in fancy's fairy dream, And rouse once more with sounding oar the slow and sluggish stream: But who is this with voice so shrill, so resolute and ready? Who cries so oft ""too late!"" ""too soon!"" ""quicker forward!"" ""Steady, steady!"" Why 'tis our young toxophilite, our ARCHER bold and true, The lightest and the tightest who has ever steered light-blue. O when he pulls the yielding string may he shoot both strong and straight, And may the night be swift and sure of his mighty arrows eight! May he add another victory to increase our Cambridge score; May Father Thames again behold the light blue to the fore! But ah! the name of Victory falls feebly on my ear-- Forgive me! 'tis not cowardice that bids me shed this tear, I weep to think that three long years have looked on our defeat; For three long years we ne'er have known the taste of triumph sweet; O Father Cam!  O Father Thames!  O ye nymphs of Chiswick eyot! O Triton!  O Poseidon!  Take some, pity on our fate! What's the use of resolution, or of training, or of science, If anxious friends and relatives to our efforts bid defiance? If they take our strongest heroes from the middle of the boat, Lest exposure to the weather should result in a sore throat? We've rowed our boat when wave on wave o'er ship and crew was dashing, And little were we troubled by the steamers and the splashing. O little do the light-blues care when tempests round them gather, We'll meet the raging of the skies, but not an angry father! For though our vessel sank, our hearts were buoyant as a feather, Since we knew that we had done our best in spite of wind and weather. Then all ye Gods and Goddesses who rule o'er lake and river, O wipe away the trembling tear which in mine eye doth quiver! O wipe away the dire defeats that now we often suffer; Let not the name of Cambridge blue be breathed with that of ""duffer!"" O melt the hearts of governors; for who can hope to thrive, If, when we're just ""together,"" they despoil us of our ""Five?"" And lastly, when 'mid shouts and cheers and screams and deafening dins, The two boats start upon their course-- "
369,ADDRESSED TO HIS UNIVERSITY.,"Wish ye, sons of Alma Mater, Long lost laurels to replace? Listen to a stout old Pater, Once renowned in many a race. Now, alas!  I'm fat and forty, And my form grows round to view; And my nose is rather ""porty;"" But my heart is still light-blue. "
370,ADDRESSED TO HIS UNIVERSITY.,"'Tis as bad as an emetic, E'en my 'baccy I refuse, When I hear that sports athletic Interfere with Cambridge crews. Once a Grecian runner famous Scorned to fight his country's foes; And to Greece, as some to Camus, Caused innumerable woes. "
371,ADDRESSED TO HIS UNIVERSITY.,"When I hear the voice parental Cry, ""my youngster shall not row!"" Then my wrath is transcendental, Then my words with vigour flow. Sires, with hearts of alabaster, Your stern ""vetos"" yet you'll rue, When ye see a sixth disaster, Overwhelm your loved light-blue. "
372,ADDRESSED TO HIS UNIVERSITY.,"But whatever to Cambridge happen, Sons of Cam behave like men! Rally round your royal Cap'en, _King_ of _Lake_, and King of Fen! Fortune helps the brave who court her, Only to yourselves be true; And perhaps, on Putney's water, Victory will crown light-blue. "
373,ADDRESSED TO HIS UNIVERSITY.,"When your Cox'en cries ""all ready,"" Be alert, dismiss all napping, Get well forward, all sit steady, Grasp the oar, avoid all ""capping:"" Shoulders square, back straight, eyes ever Fixed upon the back before; Then all eight, with one endeavour, Dip at once the bladed oar. "
374,ADDRESSED TO HIS UNIVERSITY.,"Catch your stroke at the beginning, Then let legs with vigour work: Little hope has he of winning, Who his ""stretcher"" loves to shirk. Let your rigid arms extended Be as straight as pokers two; And until the stroke is ended, Pull it, without jerking, through! "
375,ADDRESSED TO HIS UNIVERSITY.,"Thus all disputations spurning, Ye, ere many a year has past, While old Fortune's wheel is turning, Victory shall taste at last. Only wait and work together; Trust in discipline and pluck-- Soon bad luck will run his tether, And good rowing bring good luck. "
378,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"1. WATNEY    Lady Margaret.    5. STEAVENSON  Trinity Hall 2. BEEBEE    Lady Margaret.    6. BORTHWICK   1st Trinity. 3. PIGOTT    Corpus            7. GRIFFITHS   3rd Trinity. 4. KINGLAKE  3rd Trinity.      8. LAWES       3rd Trinity. Steerer, ARCHER, Corpus. "
379,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"One night, as I silently wandered By Cam's slow meandering stream, And many things mentally pondered, I saw, as it were in a dream, A black head emerge from the billows, A broad body swim through the flood, Till, beneath the o'ershadowing willows, It sank gently down in the mud. "
380,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"All alone--as a Scholar of Tyrwhitt When examined in Hebrew he sits-- On a log that mysterious spirit Smokes in silence, and silently spits. And yet not alone sat the vision; There came, as he sat on his log, A wag of delight and submission From the tail of each demi-drowned dog. "
381,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"Black eels from his temples were hanging, His teeth were like teeth of a jack; His lips were inaudibly ""slanging""; His eyes were all muddy and black; And water-snakes, round his neck twining, Were hissing; and water-rats swam At his feet; so without much divining I recognised Old Father Cam. "
382,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"""All hail to thee, Camus the reedy!"" I cried, in alarm and surprise; ""Say, why are thy garments so weedy? And why are these tears in thine eyes?"" Then the River-god answered me sadly, ""My glory aquatic is gone! My prospects, alas! look but badly; Not a race for four years have I won. "
383,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"""I have oarsmen as strong---even stronger-- Than when my first honours I bore; Their arms are as long--perhaps longer; Their shoulders as broad as of yore, Yet the prospects of light-blue look bluer; I am losing my swing, form and time; For who can row well in a sewer; Or pull through miasma and slime?"" "
384,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"Thus murmured the River-god moaning; But I bade him to dry his old eye-- ""In vain is this weeping and groaning; Let your motto be, 'Never say die!' Though your waves be more foul than Cocytus, Though your prospects, no doubt, are most blue; Since Oxford is ready to fight us, We will try to select a good crew. "
385,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"My friend Lady Margaret tells me She can lend me a Bow and a Two; The Lady, I own, sometimes sells me, But this time I am sure she'll be true. For WATNEY is wiry and plucky, And that BEEBEE'S A 1 all allow; And our boat cannot fail to be lucky With a double 1st Class in the bow. "
386,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"""Then Corpus its PIGOTT shall lend us, Young, healthy, and active, and strong; And Etona her KINGLAKE shall send us, To row our good vessel along; And Five from the head of the river, Like Pallas from Jove's head appearing, Shall add to the weight of the quiver Of the feather-weight Argonaut steering. "
387,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"""Then BORTHWICK, the mighty and massive, Shall row like a Briton at Six; And GRIFFITHS, not prone to be passive, Shall pull us to glory like bricks. Our 'Stroke,' people say, on the feather Is a trifle too fond of a pause; But while some say, 'there's nothing like leather,' I maintain there is nothing like LAWES. "
388,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"""Washerwomen, not over aquatic, Says he rows 'like a mangle'--what trash! That his swing and his time are erratic; That he puts in his oar with a splash. But these wonderful judges of rowing, If we win will be loud in applause; And declare 'the result was all owing To that excellent stroke, MR. LAWES.' "
389,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"""Our Coach, on the bank briskly riding, Will keep his strong team well together, His Bucephalus gamely bestriding, In spite of the wind and the weather. For the laws of the land you may send me To Counsel from chambers in Town; For the laws of the river commend me To the CHAMBERS of Cambridge renown. "
390,THE SORROWS OF FATHER CAM.,"""Then cheer up, beloved Father Camus! Blow your nose! dry those tears that are falling; You will live once again to be famous, In spite of the prospects appalling. Though dead dogs down your fair stream are floating, Father Cam will their odours defy; Though Oxford may beat us in boating, Yet Cambridge will 'never say die!'"" "

395,8. M. BROWN.               8. W. R. GRIFFITHS.,"Attend, all ye who wish to see the names of each stout crew, Who've come to town from cap and gown to fight for their favourite blue. "
397,OXFORD.,"First TOTTENHAM comes, a well-known name, that cattle driving Cox'en. Who oft to victory has steer'd his gallant team of Oxon. "
398,OXFORD.,"O'er Putney's course so well can he that team in safety goad, That we ought to call old Father Thames the Oxford-Tottenham Road. Then comes the Stroke, a mariner of merit and renown; Since dark blue are his colours, he can never be dun-brown. Ye who would at your leisure his heroic deeds peruse, Go, read _Tom Brown at Oxford_ by the other Tom--TOM HUGHES. Next SENHOUSE, short for Senate-house, but long enough for seven, Shall to the _eight-oar'd_ ship impart a _sen-at-orial_ leaven. Then Number Six (no truer word was ever said in joke) In keeping with his name of WOOD, has heart and limbs of oak. The voice of all aquatic men the praise of ""Five"" proclaims; No finer sight can eye delight than ""HENLEY-upon-Thames."" Then Number Four who is heaver far than a number of Macmillan, Though WILLAN'S his name may well exclaim, ""Here I am, but I hain't a willan."" [1] Then FREEMAN rows at Number Three, in a freer and manly style; No finer oar was e'er produced by the Tiber, Thames, or Nile. Let politicians, if they please, rob freemen of their vote, Provided they leave Oxford men a FREEMAN for their boat. Among the crowd of oarsmen proud no name will fame shout louder Than his who sits at Number Two, the straight and upright CROWDER. Then RAIKES rows bow, and we must allow that with all the weight that's aft The bow-oar gives a rakish air to the bows o' the dark-blue craft. This is the crew, who've donned dark blue, and no stouter team of Oxon Has ploughed the waves of old Father Thames, or owned a better Cox'en. "
400,CAMBRIDGE.,"Now, don't refuse, aquatic Muse, the glories to rehearse Of the rival crew, who've donned light blue, to row for better for worse. They've lost their luck, but retain their pluck, and whate'er their fate may be, Light blue may meet one more defeat, but disgrace they ne'er will see. We've seen them row thro' sleet and snow till they sank--""_merses profundo_"" (HORACE, forgive me!) ""_pulchrior Cami evenit arundo_."" First little FORBES our praise absorbs, he comes from a learned College, So Cambridge hopes he will pull his ropes with scientific knowledge. May he shun the charge of swinging barge more straight than an archer's arrow, May he steer his eight, as he sits sedate in the stern of his vessel narrow! Then comes the Stroke, with a heart of oak, who has stood to his flag like twenty, While some stood aloof, and were not proof against _dolce far niente_. So let us pray that GRIFFITHS may to the banks of Cam recall The swing and style, lost for a while, since the days of JONES and HALL. Then WATNEY comes, and a pluckier seven ne'er rowed in a Cambridge crew; His long straight swing is just the thing which an oarsman loves to view. Then comes KINGLAKE, of a massive make, who in spite of failures past, Like a sailor true, has nailed light-blue as his colours to the mast. The Consul bold in days of old was thanked by the Patres hoary, When, in spite of luck, he displayed his pluck on the field of Cannae gory; So whate'er the fate of the Cambridge eight, let Cambridge men agree, Their voice to raise in their Captain's praise with thrice and three times three. Then Number Five is all alive, and for hard work always ready, As to and fro his broad back doth go, like a pendulum strong and steady. Then FORTESCUE doth pull it through without delay or dawdlin'; Right proud I trow as they see him row are the merry men of Magdalen. Then comes a name well known to fame, the great and gallant BOURKE; Who ne'er was known fatigue to own, or neglect his share of work. _New zeal and_ life to each new stroke stout SELWYN doth impart, And ever with fresh vigour, like Antaeus, forward start. Then last, but not the least of all, to row the boat along, They've got a bow whom all allow to be both STILL and strong. No crew can quail, or ever fail to labour with a will, When so much strength and spirits are supplied them by their STILL. We've done our task--to you who ask the probable result We more will speak, if you next week our Prophet will consult. "
402,CAMBRIDGE.,"[1] Cf. _Pickwick_.  ""Here I am, but I hain't a willan.""--FAT BOY. "
405,I.,"I cannot rest o' the night, Mother, For my heart is cold and wan: I fear the return o' light, Mother, Since my own true love is gone. O winsome aye was his face, Mother, And tender his bright blue eye; But his beauty and manly grace, Mother, Beneath the dark earth do lie. "
407,II.,"They tell me that I am young, Mother, That joy will return once more; But sorrow my heart has wrung, Mother, And I feel the wound full sore. The tree at the root frost-bitten Will flourish never again, And the woe that my life hath smitten Hath frozen each inmost vein. "
409,III.,"Whene'er the moon's shining clear, Mother, I think o' my lover that's gone; Heaven seem'd to draw very near, Mother, As above us in glory it shone. Ah! whither hath fled all my gladness? Ah! would from life I could fly! That laying me down in my sadness I might kiss thee, my Mother, and die! "
411,AN APRIL SQUALL.,"Breathless is the deep blue sky; Breathless doth the blue sea lie; And scarcely can my heart believe, 'Neath such a sky, on such a wave, That Heaven can frown and billows rave, Or Beauty so divine deceive. "
412,AN APRIL SQUALL.,"Softly sail we with the tide; Silently our bark doth glide; Above our heads no clouds appear: Only in the West afar A dark spot, like a baneful star, Doth herald tempests dark and drear. "
413,AN APRIL SQUALL.,"And now the wind is heard to sigh; The waters heave unquietly; The Heaven above is darkly scowling; Down with the sail!  They come, they come! Loos'd from the depths of their wintry home, The wild fiends of the storm are howling. "
414,AN APRIL SQUALL.,"Hold tight, and tug at the straining oar, For the wind is rising more and more: Row like a man through the dashing brine! Row on!--already the squall is past: No more the sky is overcast; Again the sun doth brightly shine. "
415,AN APRIL SQUALL.,"Oh! higher far is the well-earn'd bliss Of quiet after a storm like this Than all the joys of selfish ease: 'Tis thus I would row o'er the sea of Life, Thus force my way through the roar and strife, And win repose by toils like these. "
418,THE TWO MAIDENS.,[The following Verses were written for a country Penny Reading]. 
419,THE TWO MAIDENS.,Two Bedfordshire maidens in one village dwelt; Side by side in their Church every Sunday they knelt; They were not very pretty and not very plain; And their names were Eliza and Emily Jane. 
420,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Now Carpenter Smith was young, steady and still, And wherever he went, worked and played with a will: To bed he went early, and early did rise; So, of course, he was healthy, and wealthy, and wise. "
421,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"But John he grew tired of a bachelor's life, So he looked all around him in search of a wife; And his eyes, as they wandered, again and again Returned to Eliza and Emily Jane. "
422,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"And whenever those maidens encountered his eye, Their pulses beat quickly (perhaps you know _why_); They each of them thought him a wonderful Don, And wished to be married to Carpenter John. "
423,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"But John, as you've heard, was a prudent young man; And determined their faults and their merits to scan; Says he, ""If I marry, I'm tied for my life; ""So it's well to be cautious in choosing a wife."" "
424,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Now I'm sorry to say that young Emily Jane Was disposed to be rather conceited and vain; In fact, for the truth I'm obliged to confess, Was decidedly fond of extravagant dress. "
425,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"So she thought the best way to the Carpenter's heart Was to purchase gay dresses and finery smart; In the carrier's van off to Bedford she went, And many weeks' wages in finery spent. "
426,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Her dress it was blue, and her ribbons were green, And her chignon the highest that ever was seen, And perched on the top, heavy-laden with flowers, Was a bonnet, embosomed in beautiful bowers. "
427,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"So red, as she walked to the Church, was her shawl That the bull in the farm-yard did bellow and bawl; And so high were her heels that on entering the door She slipped, and she stumbled, and fell on the floor. "
428,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Says Carpenter Smith, ""It's decidedly plain ""That I'd better keep clear of that Emily Jane:"" So from Emily Jane he averted his eye, And just at that moment Eliza passed by. "
429,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Now Eliza had thought, ""If his heart I subdue, ""It shall not be by dresses and finery new: ""For a lover who's taken by ornaments gay ""Will love some one else ere a week pass away."" "
430,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"So her ribbons were lilac; white straw was her bonnet; Her dress was light grey, with dark braiding upon it; Her jacket was black; and her boots of stout leather Were fitted for walking in all sorts of weather. "
431,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"She was not very pretty, and yet in her smile There was something that charmed by its freedom from guile: And tho' lowly her lot, yet her natural grace Made her look like a lady in figure and face. "
432,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"A rose from the garden she wore on her breast, And John, as her fingers he tenderly press'd, Seemed to feel a sharp arrow ('twas Cupid's first dart) Come straight from the rosebud and enter his heart. "
433,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"Now John and Eliza are husband and wife; Their quarrels are few, and contented their life; They eat and they drink and they dress in good taste, For their money they spend on their wants, not in waste. "
434,THE TWO MAIDENS.,"But I'm sorry to say that Miss Emily Jane Has still an aversion to dress that is plain; And the consequence is that she always has stayed, And is likely to stay, a disconsolate maid. "
436,MORAL.,"Young ladies, I hope you'll attend to my moral, When you hear it, I'm sure you and I shall not quarrel: If you're pretty, fine dress is not needed to show it; If you're ugly, fine dress will make all the world know it. "
437,MORAL.,"Young men, if you wish, as I trust you all do, A partner for worse or for better to woo, Don't marry a _peacock_ dressed out in gay feathers, But a _wife_ guaranteed to wear well in all weathers. "
441,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","Tom Smith was the son of a Bedfordshire man; (The Smiths, we all know, are a numerous clan) He was happy and healthy and handsome and strong, And could sing on occasion a capital song. "
442,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","His father had once been a labourer poor, But had always contrived to keep want from the door; And by work and by thrift had enough in his pocket To rent a small farm from his landlord, and stock it. "
443,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","He died: Tom succeeded: the ladies all said It was high time he went to the Church to be wed; And Sarah and Clara, and Fanny and Bess, Confessed if he ""offer'd"" perhaps they'd say ""Yes."" "
444,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","But Tom fixed his eyes on the Miller's young daughter, And was only awaiting the right time to court her; So one day as he saw her walk out from the mill, He set off in pursuit with a very good will. "
445,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","Now Tom, I must tell you, had one little fault, He was rather too fond of a mixture of malt; In fact, if my meaning is not very clear, I'm afraid he was rather too ""partial to Beer."" "
446,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","Says Tom to himself as he followed the maid, ""I should like just a glass, for I'm rather afraid""-- No doubt at such times men are nervous and queer, So he stopped at the Public for _one glass of Beer_. "
447,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","He had his one glass, and then two or three more, And when he set out from the Public-house door He saw a sad sight, and he saw it with groans-- Mary Anne on the arm of Theophilus Jones. "
448,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","Yes, Theophilus Jones was a steady young man, Who enjoyed but was never too fond of his can; And while Smith in the public was stopping to swill, Jones had woo'd and had won the fair maid of the mill. "
449,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","Tom homeward returned like a runaway pup, When the lash of the whipper-in touches him up; And he sighed to himself, ""It's most painfully clear That I've lost a _good wife_ for a _bad glass of Beer_."" "
451,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","At length he was married to Emily Brown-- A tidier girl there was none in the town-- The church bells were ringing, the village was gay, As Tom met his bride in her bridal array. "
452,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","For a twelvemonth or more things went on pretty straight; Tom went early to work, and was never home late; But after that time a sad change, it would seem, Came over the spirit of Emily's dream. "
453,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","The Rector missed Tom from his place in the choir; In the evening his wife sat alone by the fire; When her husband came home he was never too early, And his manner was dull, and at times even surly. "
454,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""",He was late in the autumn in sowing his wheat; His bullocks and sheep had disease of the feet; His sows had small litters; his taters went bad; And he took _just a glass_ when he felt rather sad. 
455,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","The Rector's ""good lady"" was passing one day, And looked in, her usual visit to pay-- ""How dy'e do, Mrs. Smith?  Is the baby quite well? Have you got any eggs, or young chickens to sell?"" "
456,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","But Emily Smith couldn't answer a word; At length her reply indistinctly was heard; ""I'm all of a mullock [1], it's no use denying--"" And with that the poor woman she burst out a crying. "
457,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","Then after a time with her apron she dried The tears from her eyes, and more calmly replied, ""I don't mind confessing the truth, ma'am, to you, For I've found in you always a comforter true. "
458,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","Things are going to ruin; the land's full o' twitch; There's no one to clean out a drain or a ditch; The gates are all broken, the fences all down; And the state of our farm is the talk of the town. "
459,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","We've lost a young horse, and another's gone lame; Our hay's not worth carting; the wheat's much the same; Our pigs and our cattle are always astray; Our milk's good-for-nothing; our hens never lay. "
460,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","Tom ain't a bad husband, as husbands do go; (That ain't saying much, as I daresay you know) But there's one thing that puts him and me out o' gear-- He's always a craving for _one glass of Beer_. "
461,"""ONE GLASS OF BEER.""","He never gets drunk, but he's always half-fuddled; He wastes all his time, and his wits are all muddled; ""We've notice to quit for next Michaelmas year-- All owing to Tom and his _one glass of Beer_!"" "
463,MORAL.,"My friends, I believe we shall none of us quarrel If I try from this story to draw out a moral; Tom Smith, I am told, has now taken the pledge; Let us hope he will keep the right side of the hedge. "
464,MORAL.,"But because men like Tom find it hard to _refrain_, It's hard that we temperate folk should _abstain_; Tea and coffee no doubt are most excellent cheer But a hard-working man likes his _one glass of Beer_. "
465,MORAL.,"What with 'chining [2] and hoeing and ploughing and drill, A glass of good beer will not make a man ill; But one glass, like poison, you never must touch-- It's the glass which is commonly called _one too much_! "
470,FRED AND BILL.,"Two twins were once born in a Bedfordshire home; Such events in the best managed households may come; Tho', as Tomkins remarked in a voice rather gruff, ""One child at a time for poor folks is enough."" "
471,FRED AND BILL.,"But it couldn't be helped, so his wife did her best; The children were always respectably drest; Went early to school; were put early to bed; And had plenty of taters and bacon and bread. "
472,FRED AND BILL.,"Now we all should suppose that the two, being twins, Resembled each other as much as two pins: But no--they as little resembled each other As the man in the moon is ""a man and a brother."" "
473,FRED AND BILL.,"Fred's eyes were dark brown, and his hair was jet black; He was supple in body, and straight in the back, Learnt his lessons without any trouble at all; And was lively, intelligent, comely, and tall. "
474,FRED AND BILL.,"But Willy was thick-set; and freckled and fair; Had eyes of light blue, and short curly red hair; And, as I should like you the whole truth to know, The schoolmaster thought him ""decidedly slow."" "
475,FRED AND BILL.,"But the Parson, who often came into the school, Had discovered that Willy was far from a fool, And that tho' he was not very quick in his pace, In the end ""slow and steady"" would win in the race. "
476,FRED AND BILL.,"Years passed--Fred grew idle and peevish and queer; Took to skittles, bad language, tobacco, and beer: Grew tired of his work, when it scarce was begun; Was Jack of all trades and the master of none. "
477,FRED AND BILL.,"He began as a labourer, then was a clerk; Drove a hansom in London by way of a ""lark;"" Enlisted, deserted, and finally fled Abroad, and was thought by his friends to be dead. "
478,FRED AND BILL.,"But Willy meanwhile was content with his lot; He was slow, but he always was found on the spot; He wasted no money on skittles and ale, But put by his pence, when he could, without fail. "
479,FRED AND BILL.,"To the Penny Bank weekly his savings he took, And soon had a pretty round sum in his book: No miser was he, but he thought it sound sense In the days of his youth to put by a few pence. "
480,FRED AND BILL.,"And so he got on; he was no millionaire, But he always had money enough and to spare; Could help a poor friend; pay his rent and his rate; And always put silver at church in the plate. "
481,FRED AND BILL.,"His brother, meantime, who was thought to be dead, Had across the Atlantic to Canada fled; Then had gone to New York; then New Zealand had tried; But always had failed thro' perverseness and pride. "
482,FRED AND BILL.,"He might have done well, but wherever he went, As soon as his money came in, it was spent; As of old he tried all trades, and prospered in none, For he thought that hard work was ""a poor sort of fun."" "
483,FRED AND BILL.,"Then he heard of ""the diggings,"" and there tried his luck; He was never deficient in smartness and pluck; And by means of some work, and more luck, in a year He managed to make fifteen hundred pounds clear. "
484,FRED AND BILL.,"Then he thought of old England and Bedfordshire chums, So back to his parish in triumph he comes; And need I remark he found many a friend Right willing to help him his nuggets to spend? "
485,FRED AND BILL.,"He turned up his nose at his poor brother Bill, Who was always content to be plodding up hill; Hard work he disliked, he despised peace and quiet, So he spent all his time and his money in riot. "
486,FRED AND BILL.,"There was never a horse-race but Fred he was there; He went to each meet, meeting, marker and fair; In a few words, his candle he burnt to the socket, Till he found one fine day not a rap in His pocket. "
487,FRED AND BILL.,Then his poor brother Bill came and lent him a hand; Gave him work and a share of his own bit of land; If he means to keep steady I cannot surmise-- Let us hope that at length Fred has learnt to be wise. 
488,FRED AND BILL.,"But one thing is plain, if you mean to get on, You will find that success must by patience be won; In the battle of life do not trust to your luck, But to honest hard work, perseverance, and pluck. "
489,FRED AND BILL.,"Don't turn up your nose at a hard-working chap, For pride soon or later must meet with mishap; And wherever your lot in the world may be cast, ""Slow and steady"" goes safer than ""foolish and fast."" "
490,FRED AND BILL.,"Take warning by Fred, and avoid for a friend The man who would tempt you your savings to spend; Don't waste your spare money in riotous pranks, But put it in Penny, or Post-office Banks. "
493,"HOME, SWEET HOME.","I'm a Bedfordshire Chap, and Bill Stumps is my name, And to tell it don't give me no manner of shame; For a man as works honest and hard for his livin', When he tells you his name, needn't feel no misgivin'. "

504,"HOME, SWEET HOME.","My Poll wor a steady young gal, and a good 'un For washin' and scrubbin', and makin' a pudden; Not one o them gossiping gals, wot I hate, But a quoietish 'ooman, wi' brains in her pate. "

506,"HOME, SWEET HOME.","And Poll she look'd sadly, but didn't say nought; She was one as 'ud allers say less than she thought; But I know'd what she thought--so a cloud kind o' come, And darkened the sun as once shone in our home, "
507,"HOME, SWEET HOME.","But it come to a pass--'twas the fifth o' November, The day and the year I shall allers remember: Twas midnight and past when I come to my door, Scarce able to stan'--well, I won't say no more? "
