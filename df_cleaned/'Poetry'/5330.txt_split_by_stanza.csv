3,IN MY PLACE,"Pray thee let none shall bar it's not the questions, where or when God grant I shan't be far In place of person, spirit then 8>) "
5,RISKING FOR A SIGN,The nectar is sweet if the heart so dares never for the meek where riskiness stares Just risking for a sign 
6,RISKING FOR A SIGN,It won't stay when you stay Goes when you're own your toes The rewards are from the chase Reach for it but never in haste Nothing does like it does 
7,RISKING FOR A SIGN,By Faith we hope and pray Events roll out and lay Grasp for handles in a maze Readiness with a brace I'll take it in if I may 
8,RISKING FOR A SIGN,The nectar is sweet if the heart so dares those willing to seek where riskiness bares Just risking for a sign 8>) 
10,RISE AND SHINE,Gilded sun rays clear the haze Lighted lights go out apace Another rise over the mount Live creatures roused from their fount 
11,RISE AND SHINE,Beings they gather and disperse Shrieking shouts and small whispers Wings above while eyes trained below all stir for what might follow 
12,RISE AND SHINE,Those ordained all fall in line some lie still in thoughts opined chosen ones to fruition live while others Fates weigh and sieve 8>) 
13,FOR MY FRIENDS,FOR MY FRIENDS 1 Courtesy in deeds driven Ev'ry gesture plays a part Fair regard gladly given Fondness well planted in heart 
14,FOR MY FRIENDS,"2 Ye fair rovers in life torches glow and fires swell upon the reach of warm hive We wish thee ""all be well"" "
15,FOR MY FRIENDS,3 For those true let none deceive Be relieved by what's believed Within sadness joy's reprieve Joy increased from joy received 8>) 
17,YEAR'S END,The present year retires to rest with history Another course expires to lodge in memory 
18,YEAR'S END,A new course woven and spun while we adorn its space Concerns commence and are done come what may rush or haste 
19,YEAR'S END,A hope and toast to what's new fond farewell to what's past Let our joys never be few and may fond regard last 8>) 
21,BLISS WE'RE FINDIN',The heart shan't huddle in heavy pinin' For as long as there's a silver linin' From murky shadows it's hope we're minin' Through search and tumble it's bliss we're findin' 8>) 
23,A GLANCE AT TIME,What is this fleeting moment? An hourglass filled with cascading sand Passes us in joy or lament While we compelled or by own choosing attend 8>) 
25,"CRUMB, ICEBERG AND GLIMMER",A few things to nourish us in this request in verse Give us a crumb from that loaf A humble comfort blanket Grant us a splinter of frost above Findings spawn from tip of iceberg Save some glow off the glimmer Hope preserved and mirrored 
26,"CRUMB, ICEBERG AND GLIMMER",Those who give shan't be in want Those who receive in penury shan't If they wisely give and they wisely spend There'll be none to grieve But much to append 8>) 
28,ANTIQUE STREET,Faded bronze picture pretty where cracks add curiosity mounting age make things vintage authentic guarantee's pledge yesterday's streets I tarry Green moss carpets alley 8>) 
30,A VERSE OF THANKS,I thank thee for thy patronage rhyme like wine improves with age though I shan't be a hermit sage I'm glad thou had found this page 8>) 
32,FOR VERSES' SAKE,There's nothing here at stake But the reasons we state come play for verses' sake lines of prosaic prose break 8>) 
34,HOPE IN THE DARKEST HOUR,The pall of the darkest hour Is lifted by Faith's power Let burn your resolve's ardour There's relief in Hope's harbour! 8>) 
36,NUMBER CRUNCHER,one over two I am not two of three they said not three times four she had not four from five he knew not five and six a naught not six sevens they saw not seven eights it was not eight nines they brought not nine a ten it is not Good heavens is what I've got! 8>)

44,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Though oft cautioned we pass unwarily An earthly life's junctures and maze Fitting pieces circumstantially In wakeful awareness and daze 8>) 
46,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Circumstance is fleeting We run with the current and do what we must In retrospect fitting Ignorant of present and wise of the past 8>) 
48,NUMBER CRUNCHER,"Chaos plays Jack-in-a-Box Father Time oils his clocks Mother Nature preens her hair Courage makes his own chair Fate deals her card deck Past is ever dwelling back Present plays with Here and Now Future poses with When and How Peace reclines in sweet repose Purity, not a spot on her clothes Wish speculates wistfully Reality alters mercurially Sleep is strictly not to be disturbed Wakefulness stirs on its own turf "
49,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Those which have been named Our tempers they have tamed Spans of ages they have reigned Outlasting Pride and things vain 8>) 
51,NUMBER CRUNCHER,From its perch molten orb uncovers day As diurnal beings emerge to seek hay From its perch Certainty clears murky As it hands Conscience the masterkey 8>) 
53,NUMBER CRUNCHER,We are drunk by sweet claret Our Fates dealt by tarot By causes the brows had furrowed For causes reserves had burrowed Take us to where redemption's moored We head forth firm where none detoured 8>) 
55,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Surprise quirks spur a thirst that which quenches hungers a second follows first that which restores changes 8>) 
57,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Allow me your sweet musings Those worry and hurry overlooked Fairer than sweet nothings Solace and Patience shan't be duped 8>) 
59,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Curiosity taps my hesitation My gaze blinks warily What's the price of revelation? Mere lunge and peep only? 8>) 
61,NUMBER CRUNCHER,The hand that won the crown The same hand wipes the brow Look ye all up and down The same one anyhow 8>) 
63,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Our bliss filled wings flutter The heart traipses with rapture Pure joy has its mirrors Smiling delight it sires 8>) 
65,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Let not might expire At the topmost spire Nor fine sinews tire Bogged in messy mire Come strike and feed first spark Hues to all pale and stark 8>) 
67,NUMBER CRUNCHER,"Within a bewildered mire Resolve sires inner fire Speedy streaks aimless confusion wreaks Like brittle burnt twigs confusion creaks An inner spark, emerges, divulges Upon mortal frailty, comforts, touches Lament not in sorrow Embrace the fair morrow "
68,NUMBER CRUNCHER,"Deeds past lodge in memory's place My time now in haste or good pace The crook of the trick my conscience prick Truth I seek for it I shan't be meek A lively spark, emerges, divulges Upon mortal frailty , comforts, touches Lament not with sorrow Embrace the fair morrow 8>) "
70,NUMBER CRUNCHER,"Mighty obligation curtailed voice Left us splinters we took as choice I've been bumped from nook to cranny Had some, somedays crumbs of plenty Yet learned and notched miles and hours On wet grass to brazen towers It's sweat, dread, I'm glad to have left Despite and in spite of, unsapped On full alert to hit the heights Bide in stride and take in the sights 8>) "
72,NUMBER CRUNCHER,"Fear me not I am not Harm Unclench fists and ready arm I see woven threads, wordly realms The beaten track and what it seems Crossroads present ripples the current Absent indulgence tickles serpent "
74,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Defy Destiny you live in grief Welcome what's to be then judge and sieve Keep the torch blazing in its glow Leave solace basking in the know My sanctum now sows the seed The seer's form to edge recede 8>) 
76,NUMBER CRUNCHER,Come my dears the sun yellow Beckons thee out of sorrowful wallow The pit of tears runs too shallow For lively spirits mellow and callow Let's be gone with many a-bellow We cross the hollow elbow to elbow 8>) 
78,FINICKY FANCY,"Go and Run ,skulk and hide The hazy signs of next delight ever mercurial as fickle tide you say it's done then you might "
79,FINICKY FANCY,"I shall run and stay beside No cell here is watertight Evolution's a bumpy ride It's not done, might just might 8>) "
81,RHYME JIVE,"Glasses of wine crowns a good dine Sips of rhyme to while the time I say mine, you say your line Brightens the clime, isn't it fine? 8>) "
83,RHYME JIVE,If you said gin and tonic I think you're prophetic But if you called for beer Bear the wine drinkers' sneer Got caught in my veins some scotch Surprised my mind's not scorched If I hear of old Bloody Mary Let me check out cash and carry Now don't you say rum and tequila My marushka let's pour some vodka I'm really not that taciturn Just the burden of some bourbon 8>) 
85,SEASIDE SUNRISE,"From distance and depths they roll nearer like a constant stroll their formation fluidly rustling nearing leaves slovenly shaking salt in my nose, curled up my toes I can see the troopers moving hither "
86,SEASIDE SUNRISE,"Horizon of scattered specks unheeding fluid troopers' tracks wavy phalanx forward advance prance a primordial nature's dance glare in my eyes, from morn sunrise my attention attends along the strand 8>) "
88,SEASIDE SUNRISE,Drowned by the hand of mortality a soul shines where Angels ply with Goodness pure and Divine mercy (s)he now dwells where Angels fly 8>) 
90,SEASIDE SUNRISE,When it all rolls over and our hearts sobered I'll be a face in the crowd 
91,SEASIDE SUNRISE,When the hurly-burly bustle on its own weight tumble I'll stay a face in the crowd 
92,SEASIDE SUNRISE,When I take things slower and I'm less of a mover I'll be a face in the crowd 
93,SEASIDE SUNRISE,When I'm less able to bet on the table I'll stay a face in the crowd 
94,SEASIDE SUNRISE,When voices speak softer less to excite over I'll be a face in the crowd 
95,SEASIDE SUNRISE,Let's pack it all in live off it from within Just like a face in the crowd 8>) 
97,SEASIDE SUNRISE,All our given sunrises All our sunsets ordained All our best desires All our hearts proclaimed All untruth never maul All truest all in all 8>) 
99,AIR OF SUSPENSE,An air of suspense sweeps over me A wonder only seen in dreams A great rush of heavenly fidelity and my spirit dances among moonbeams 
100,AIR OF SUSPENSE,High over valleys my joy rallies I wish and long to dally alas dreams are like snow fade when it's time to go 
101,AIR OF SUSPENSE,"But this joy I'll evermore recall when among the clouds I stand tall as my heart leaps, among hilly peaks I'll cherish deep and recall the trip "
102,AIR OF SUSPENSE,An air of suspense sweeps over me A wonder only seen in dreams A great rush of heavenly fidelity and my spirit dances among moonbeams 8>) 
104,AIR OF SUSPENSE,For though it seems the horizon wide was swallowed by the ink of night Hope still resides by your side Strength to resume sparks alight 8>) 
106,AIR OF SUSPENSE,"Happiness isn't an all time high But when it comes it does not lie as much as you can without frowning and letting go without drowning Not the mystery tucked in a box or a steeple chase marked by clocks Contentment and an unruffled heart A gift from Life, an acquired art! 8>) "
108,AIR OF SUSPENSE,sparks and thoughts they do combine thy brief verses grant it clime the poetic deed shall be incomplete should verse denied of rhyme replete at rest in this forest I do beseech a pause then to Parnassus reach ! 
109,AIR OF SUSPENSE,symmetry of rhyme addiction weaves and spins bear fruition past concepts and articulations through the truth and truisms thus the quest of poetic frenzy by far loftier than mere fancy 8>) 
111,DOM THE GOOF,"Footsteps, they clatter as I looked to the mirror is it for the better? I'm a habitual worrier "
112,DOM THE GOOF,Your eyes reached for me but I was ever unsure did I transgress decency of this new culture? 
113,DOM THE GOOF,It was not what it seemed this gaze of avid urgency A glass up to its brim I carried on nonchalantly 
114,DOM THE GOOF,The waiter a while lingered thought he a catastrophe a full glass to him mattered another spill casualty? 
115,DOM THE GOOF,I delicately sipped the outskirts of the rim thus in one sip I nipped the bungle at the brim 8>) 
117,DOM THE GOOF,"Words to proselitize Words to hail Words to define Words to douse silence Words to rouse Speech is a double edged gift In stroke , ails and heals. "
118,DOM THE GOOF,"Words to state plainly Words to choke gasps of worries Words to accompany deeds Words to line void of ignorance Words to fill gaps of craving Language is a double edged gift In a swoop , blights and blesses. 8>) "
120,A SMILING CONUNDRUM,"A simple act of smiling carries abundant nuances. Its appearance unfolds subtleties in spells so brief that attention has to acquire suppleness and clairvoyance in order to trace its intention. An emotional armour, an ignorant smirk, a habitual display, a crack of dismay. It serves as an olive branch, a link of mutuality, a spirit booster, a disarming tool. It wriggles so mildly into the domain that it catches us off-guard in an awkward pose in the midst of some complication, a teaser's toy, a perplexing foil, a facial perk up. It has beguiled hearts for generations, a warm gesture of agreement , nonchalant bravado, unperturbed defiance, a universal affirmation of pleasure. 8>) "
122,BETWEEN FASTING AND FEASTING,"Inspiration alternates between fasting and feasting. Let it cascade from funnels of thoughts. Improvise and let fancies weave as much and as often as they please. There is unity despite this mish-mesh . Inspiration gushes more than our fill can contain. It flows till each kernel is milked of its essence, then recedes to miserly trickling. "
123,BETWEEN FASTING AND FEASTING,"It hibernates as themes ossify, mummified in rumination's chrysalis. Charges to the fore of consciousness and floats to the spout of the fount when ripeness blooms. 8>) "
125,ON PARTING,"I had long anticipated this parting. I had wept in anticipation of this. Intense pain coiled around refusal and vexation, caused by anger that it should pass so soon. To heave our chests with sobs, wail ourselves hoarse, sap breath of air are futile. Part we must. "
126,ON PARTING,I cannot offer tears now. I had wept in anticipation of this. Senses stay with me as I go about matter-of-factly. But sorrow is real. Whoever who has emotions and compassion will surely feel the tight knot on heartstrings in times of grief. Part we must. 
127,ON PARTING,Mourning lasts not forever. Speak not of regret. Seek joys shared. Extricate the most comely or comical picture of the departed from recesses of recall or from the picture archive. 
128,ON PARTING,"Caress those treasured tokens. Care for them well. Mortality had usurped and carried them across the walls while those living, are moored here still. 8>) "
130,AFTER THE HURT,"We wince, grimace, we deny, we blush, we withdraw, we stumble, grapple for a hold then surge wildly with our hurt, to our sanctuary, for security, for support, for sympathy which we so badly lack. Our egos soothed, our pride mended, our resolve restored, our courage renewed. We make our way out of the zone of our sanctuary to the swirl of life, kingdom of actuality, the playfield of fortune, the polarity of cause and effect. We stand our ground, stake our claim, carve our indentations upon eternity. 8>) "
132,AT THE DOCKS,"Pungence of the coast enter the nostrils before sight glimpses the first outlines of the docks. As we gaze around the coastal settlement , all manner of architecture, decorations, signage and paraphernalia suggest an ode to the sea and a boatman's lot. "
133,AT THE DOCKS,"The utilitarian magnetism of a rugged painted scene experienced live. Water's surface beside ravaged outskirts of the docks. Rusty submerged pillars and barnacles,  so common a sight, they go unnoticed. "
134,AT THE DOCKS,"Foam formations and breaking foam. Reflections of the surface on a good sunny day like fluid sequins , they gleam. Vessels off to the wide open and vessels approaching.   The mutable tide and current. Bobbing buoys and crafts. "
135,AT THE DOCKS,"An assemblage of scattered generators, expelled fumes, sputtering engines with cadence of speech merge to form a union of din. Picture perfect for a tourist. It's an average day in the lives of those whose fortunes depend on the day's catch and nature's dictates. "
136,AT THE DOCKS,"Tobacco smoke, grunts, gruff ramblings, murmurs, occasional raised volume, wellingtons, raincoats, overcoats and windbreakers. Footsteps upon tarred passages. Shadows of beings cast on cobblestone walkways. The stooped, hunched, sprightly and nimble. "
137,AT THE DOCKS,"It's a rare sight for a pristine boat to be moored at the docks or a seafarer in uncreased gear, whose presence is devoid of telltale salty scent. Eyes accustomed to the regular scene spies a newcomer with ease. 8>) "
139,WANDERER'S NOTATION,"A trace of superstition still hangs upon them. The past is as tangible as actuality. They live it, they breathe within dominions of their time and those once trod by their forefathers. The legacy is both strong and benevolent. Hence , so is the affinity between generations long parted and the living present. The departed have never truly departed from the consciousness of those still living, though not every name is known but their presence is persistent. The people here, they're a mite superstitious. Youthful formative years were liberally imbued with rhymes and odes of folklore where there is no sharp divide of legend from history. The structured education of logic, truth and reasoning heap upon indentations first forged by lore, diligently learned during childhood. A clear innocence flavour their pursuits. A sense of unobtrusive dignity pervade pursuits spanning from exalted undertakings to prosaic chores. If there is a place where a wanderer would gaze back with longing in heart and a vow to return, it would be this. "

142,(A PIECE ABOUT ILLEGAL WEEKEND RACING),pungence of pumping exhaust hazy light beams streak their path through the murky blur 
143,(A PIECE ABOUT ILLEGAL WEEKEND RACING),the public mingle at street fringes as streaks of lights mark their motorised presence 
144,(A PIECE ABOUT ILLEGAL WEEKEND RACING),has anyone found their night's beacon ? or is it only tonight's attraction destined to be next morning's faded memory ? 
145,(A PIECE ABOUT ILLEGAL WEEKEND RACING),screeches and skids upon asphalt surface burning rubber doused by moist surface 
146,(A PIECE ABOUT ILLEGAL WEEKEND RACING),thrills in a rush bets on the line for momentary glory without flawless display a reckless fool he becomes 
147,(A PIECE ABOUT ILLEGAL WEEKEND RACING),how we've lived and where we're heading vanishes when adrenaline shoots from a quick draw all philosophical speculation abruptly cease 
148,(A PIECE ABOUT ILLEGAL WEEKEND RACING),has anyone found their life's beacon ? or is it only tonight's attraction destined to crack up and fade at first light ? 8>) 
150,MARKET PLACE,Peddlers and buyers parley. Each trying to inch to a compromise. When the deal is struck it is a mutual reward of patience for both. Both profit at an agreed cost. Hear peddlers hail and rave indiscreetly about their wares to passers-by with the purpose of making buyers out of browsers. 
151,MARKET PLACE,The market place is where material desire pursues realistic needs and perpetuates the jousting between persuasive wit and adamant refusal. Sweet recommendations slide up to those who pass by without a list and fill their minds with the lure of the next bargain. 
152,MARKET PLACE,"Barrage upon barrage of humanity locked in bargaining, scurrying to and from , browsing without purpose, seeking with marked intentions. The market place is where friends with acquaintances , kinfolk with strangers tread the common way. Fresh links hooked. Old ties renewed. It is up to the individual to disclose or evade the throng of queries. "
153,MARKET PLACE,"Smoothen frowns caused by fretting . Weary minds, take a hike along the market place. There's variety to be had within the stream of humanity there. It teases interest and flicks a spark on the fuse of humour. With senses and caution, join the jostling. Emerge none the poorer. So much the richer. 8>) "
155,CORNER STREET,"A mob masses at a side street. Something which they hear intrigue them so. It rises above their routine bustling hassle. A booming invitation from a corner street salesman who hones his pitch to perfection. He nets commuters with his velvet lure of promise... for a fee. Wielding his selling lines like a coveted bauble while he tugs with his words. Those touched by his pitch tow along like an entourage of mice, latching on to the Pied Piper. The horde crane their necks for a ring side view , stretch limbs to advance nearer and strain sight for a close up. He stands high , above all heads , on a concrete pulpit and proceeds to wean all to his prescription. He proclaims ""For a fee, the majority will attain a share of a rare minority"". 8>) "
157,PROMENADE MUSICIAN,"A promenade musician with repertoire of tunes to whisk the rhythm of your gait away. Fixes you to a standstill and makes the heart yearn for sweetness which she coaxes from the strings. She plays for her keep. Touched generosity bestow appreciation into a ready hat. The last note done , she raises her head to acknowledge the spontaneous cheers. Gazes back to the tool of her trade, readies herself and plucks the strings again to sweep the next passer-by into the honeyed core of melody. 8>) "
159,OF DESIRE AND VIGOUR,"We are charioteers with vigorous steeds, eager to spring off to pace the breeze and pit against the wind. But what is vigour without defined intent ? A fatuous waste of good strength. Fuse desire, vigour and achievement into a singular fruition. When splintered, there is inner vortex which spirals and heckles mercilessly, relentlessly. Restless ambition is unsettled. It leaps in step with rousing craving. Wanting, coveting, desiring, they are emotions coaxed into being by experience, which meddle with our senses. Tame their potency, induce direction and order. To do so , the heart's pounding is reined and driven by reason. 8>) "
161,ARCADIA,"A place to grow old in. Verdant slopes teem with pastoral greenery. Waves splinter on craggy rocks and cliffs. They,  the vanguards of the coast. Showered and mired with the sea's deep blue depth. Effervescent streaks of foam marks each agitation. Thoroughfares , serenaded by minstrels. Be enchanted by wayfarer's tales, drawn to the romance of fables and ruminate on the bitter-sweet myths. Trace stony mounds with the soles as the feet step on cobble stone streets. Homely public houses, freshly cooked square meals at cafs and bonhomie, as common as courtesy. Live our days in contentment. Good banter abound and rousing humour gallops. It is at once both country and city. Neither be in want of conveniences nor be compelled to forego the space of privacy. A place to grow old in. 8>) "
163,PAGAN PRAYER,"Divine Apollo, won't you roll us another day ? Slide the shadows and give us light. Then we'll know that yesterday was not our last. We live another day to tread and carve this earth. Orpheus, won't you play us another tune ? Spur those weary ones. Lull anguished souls. Calm eddies of worried minds. Soothe and entertain those left. Poseidon, bring your chariot over your kingdom of the sea, with your sacred trident, bless the seas with plenty. Let the winds be kind to sailors. Let the catch be rich. Tame the ocean's ferocity when it vexes. Aphrodite, be benevolent to those who seek love. Kindle passion yet temper its infectious intensity lest the glow becomes a torrid pyre. Eros plays tricks with his arrows and bow. Allow us the power to discern with liberty of choice and reason as company. Hermes, we pray that you bring glad tidings to us mortals. We long to hear you proclaim , o messenger of the Gods , that needless bloodshed shall be no more. That goodness rules. Hope subdues chaos released by Pandora. All injustice undone. Suffering's grief and tears shed cleansed from memory. Athene, guide us from machinations of Evil. Grant us the gift of Courage and Perseverance. The same which you had given Odysseus for we too endure our own odysseys. Demons and villains, they alter their guises well and cunningly. Hades, keep your train beneath the world. Your faithful Cerberus, bark and bite not at mortal heels before our time. Our course governed by Heaven's trade with the Reapers at your command. O Fates, lead us gently and guide us well into the Hereafter. Supreme Zeus, the one of the feared thunderbolt. Mightiest of Olympians, final arbiter. With a fraction of your wisdom, we shall have sight of sense. With that sense, breathe wisdom in our actions and curtail weaknesses. Your blessing and mercy be upon us all still. 8>) "
165,PAGAN PRAYER,"1 What's to come, to be done This while's all future and now Impulse leaves with gracious bow Straying would've harmed "
166,PAGAN PRAYER,2 The ebbing glow of twilight Brings the hints of hopes bright Dispense of loud proclamations There's ample from quiet assurances Heartening presence in spirit Which no one else but us know it 
167,PAGAN PRAYER,3 We enjoy the delights within our grasp Tempted by mirages out of reach Forsake comforts for sweat and gasps to return with trophies and preach 
168,PAGAN PRAYER,4 What's said in confidence Expects silence in return To stay true to intention Is the best recompense 8>)
