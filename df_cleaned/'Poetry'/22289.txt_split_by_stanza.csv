43,[P] I,The worldly kynges hauynge the soueraynte ye do well obey without resystence ye dare not take theyr names in vanyte But with grete honoure and eke reuerence Than my name more hye of magnyfycence ye ought more to drede whiche am kynge of all Bothe god and man and reygne celestyall 
44,[P] I,No erthely man loueth you so well As I do / which mekely dyde enclyne For to redeme you from the fendes of hell Takynge your kynde by my godhede dyuyne you were the fendes I dyde make you myne For you swete bretherne I was on the rode Gyuynge my body my herte and my blode 
45,[P] I,Than why do ye in euery maner of place With cruell othes tere my body and herte My sydes and woundes it is a pyteous cace Alas swete brederne I wolde you conuerte For to take vengeaunce ye do me coherte From the hous of swerers shall not be absent The plage of Iustyce to take punysshement

50,[P] I,My wordes my prelates vnto you do preche For to conuerte you from your wretchednes But lytell auaylleth you nowe for to teche The worlde hathe cast you in such blyndnes Lyke vnto stones your hertes hathe hardnes That my swete wordes may not reconsyle Your hertes harde with mortall synne so vyle

To take grete payne as his power wyll extende Agaynst the worlde the flesshe and the deuyll By my grete grace for to withstande theyr euyll 
60,[P] I,For who can be a gretter fole than he That spendeth his tyme to hym vncertayne For a breuyat pleasure of worldly vanyte Than after that to haue eternall payne Who of the worlde delyteth and is fayne Shall after sorowe and cry ve ve In an other worlde quante sunt tenebre

67,[P] I,Am not I wounded for the suffycyent Haue I not for the ynoughe afflyccyon Leue more to synne by good amendement The wounde of synne to me is more passyon Than the wounde of my syde for thy redempcyon Thoughe I do spare I shall you desteny But ye amende to brenne eternally

79,AMEN.,"Capital U/V is shown as ""V"" for consistency, although the letterform is closer to ""U"". Thorn [Th] appears several times at the beginning of lines, and once in an abbreviation; ""th"" is used everywhere else. A series of lines on page A.iiii. verso, starting with ""ye neyther loue me nor my Iustyce fere"", have initial lower-case ""y"". The first of these may have been necessary to avoid collision with the [Th] of theprevious line. "
80,AMEN.,"In verse, nasal abbreviations such as [an] and [en] appear only in lines with large initial drop caps. Other abbreviations--mainly in the Latin passages--are shown in brackets:  [qui], [christi]. The word shown as [thou] was printed as ""u"" directly above ""thorn"" (not ""y""). "
