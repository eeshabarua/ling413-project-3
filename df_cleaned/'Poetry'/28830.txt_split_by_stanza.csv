28,SONG THE SECOND.,"To saddle his courser Ranild cried: _For thus the tale was told to me_-- ""To visit the rich Greve I will ride, Though banish'd from the land we be."" "
29,SONG THE SECOND.,"To the house came Ranild spurring hard, _For thus the tale was told to me_-- There stood the Greve arrayed in mard, Though banish'd from the land we be. "
30,SONG THE SECOND.,"""Hail, hail, Sir Greve, arrayed so fine! _For thus the tale was told to me_-- I want my bride, the little Kirstine, Though banish'd from the land I be."" "
31,SONG THE SECOND.,"Then up and spoke her mother dear: _For thus the tale was told to me_-- ""Thou hast no bride, Sir Ranild, here, For banish'd from the land ye be."" "
32,SONG THE SECOND.,"""O if I can't my little bride get, _For thus the tale was told to me_-- On fire your house and your gear I'll set, Though banish'd from the land I be."" "
33,SONG THE SECOND.,"""O rather than ruin us in thy wrath, _For thus the tale was told to me_-- Receive thy bride and ride thy path, Though banish'd from the land ye be."" "
34,SONG THE SECOND.,"They o'er her threw the blue cloak with speed, _For thus the tale was told to me_-- And placed her upon Sir Ranild's steed, Though banish'd from the land he be. "
35,SONG THE SECOND.,"They had for their bridal bed alone, _For thus the tale was told to ne_-- The holt, the field, and the mead new mown, For banish'd from the land they be. "
36,SONG THE SECOND.,"""The forest can hear, and the mead can view, _For thus the tale was told to me_-- We here must live as outlaws do, For banish'd from the land we be."" "
37,SONG THE SECOND.,"""Hadst thou not helped the King to slay, _For thus the tale was told to me_-- In peace at home we now might stay, But banish'd from the land we be."" "
38,SONG THE SECOND.,"He struck her a blow the table o'er, _For thus the tale was told to me_-- ""Should'st guard thy tongue, child, guests before, Though banish'd from the land we be."" "
39,SONG THE SECOND.,"He struck her on her face so fair: _For thus the tale was told to me_-- ""In Erik's death I had no share, Though banished from the land I be."" "
41,SONG THE THIRD.,"So wide around the tidings bound That Ranild's prisoner taken; Had he been aware how it would fare He had not Hielm forsaken. The death of woe, spaed long ago, They'll wreak on him now, I reckon. "
42,SONG THE THIRD.,"Into the hall steps Ranild tall, And withouten trepidation; Bids his Lord good bye, and the chivalry Who have at court their station. O, Lord Christ! be each man kept free From misfortune and tribulation. "
43,SONG THE THIRD.,"""In mind dost bear, King Erik dear, On whom may blessings pour, That service I wrought in your father's court, Of all his swains the flower? Both in and out I've borne you about In sunshine and in shower."" "
44,SONG THE THIRD.,"""Yes, service you wrought in my father's court, For money and clothes imparted, And betrayed his life to the foeman's knife, Like a monster treacherous hearted. And as sure as now the crown's on my brow, To the wheel thou shalt be carted."" "
45,SONG THE THIRD.,"""Hew off, I intreat, my hands and feet, Most willingly them I proffer; My eyes blood red tear out of my head, And the worst death let me suffer; But all the pains that Ranild gains For his treason scarce enough are."" "
46,SONG THE THIRD.,"""Thine eyeballs twain thou may'st retain, And thy hands and feet unriven; But thou thy breath shalt yield to a death The cruellest under heaven; And be it known, for my father alone This punishment is given."" "
47,SONG THE THIRD.,"Ranild they brought from Roskild out, He wrung his hands with sorrow; And the women all salt tears let fall, Who lived in that ancient borough. The wretched wight wished all good night, And a light heart on the morrow. "
48,SONG THE THIRD.,"Ranild they bore the town before, The wheel his sight saluted: ""Christ guard each noble from such like trouble,"" In agony he shouted, ""If at Hielm I'd staid it had better sped, Nor to that had I been devoted. "
49,SONG THE THIRD.,"""Would God would send a trusty friend, Who would my message carry, To Kirstine fair, who sits in care, To Ranild true to tarry. O Christ help all my babies small, And bless my bosom's dearie! "
50,SONG THE THIRD.,"""Ye Christian folk, whom, with dying look, On the mead I am discerning, A pater pray for my soul, to stay Of God the anger burning; That me He receive this very eve To the joys for which I'm yearning."" "
52,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Child Stig and Child Findal two brothers were they, There ne'er were two brothers more gallant and gay. "
53,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Child Stig serves the Dane King in bower and hall, High dames brushed his hair, and fair maidens withal. "
54,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Child Stig by the board of the Monarch he stood, To him little Kirstin was cruel of mood. "
55,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Full seven years I have been Lord of the Rune, Of its power I'll make trial this same afternoon."" "
56,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,With his right hand he skinked the wine and the mead And cast with his left the Rune characters dread. 
57,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"To cast them on Kirstin the gallant Stig meant, But under the dress of Rigissa they went. "
58,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"O pallid as ashes the gallant Stig grew, And red as the blood was Rigissa to view. "
59,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The gallant Child Stig placed his cap on his head, And unto his foster dame's chamber he sped. "
60,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Dear Foster dame, give me some counsel, I pray, How I may escape from this palace away. "
61,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""To cast the Rune letters at Kirstin I meant, But under the dress of Rigissa they went. "
62,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""I will mount my good courser so true and so tried, And away to the ends of the earth I will ride."" "
63,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Said she: ""Shouldst thou travel all Finland around, This night at thy couch will Rigissa be found. "
64,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""And e'en shouldst thou ride to the earth's farthest land, This night by thy couch she will certainly stand. "
65,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""But, Child Stig, I advise thee, call up a good heart, And home to thy bed and thy slumbers depart. "
66,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""She'll tap on the door of thy chamber, I ween, But still do thou keep, let her in by no mean. "
67,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""But ten fingers has she, so tiny and small, And with them from the door she will pick the nails all. "
68,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""She will set herself down on the side of thy bed, And play with the long yellow locks of thy head. "
69,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""So fondly she'll stroke thy fair cheek in the dark, But do thou remain as thou wert stiff and stark. "
70,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""She'll kiss thee full oft on thy lips rosy red, But do thou lie still as were life from thee fled."" "
71,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Child Stig he gave ear to his foster dame's rede, And away to his bed he betook him with speed. "
72,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"'Twas late in the even, and down fell the dew, Rigissa flung o'er her her mantle of blue. "
73,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The lovely maid she her blue mantle put on, And unto the chamber of Stig she is gone. "
74,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"On the door of the chamber begins she to knock: ""Arise, O Child Stig, and thy chamber unlock."" "
75,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""At the Ting to appear, I have summoned no wight, And none I'll admit to my chamber at night."" "
76,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"She's fingers, ten fingers, so tiny and small, And out of the door she has picked the nails all. "
77,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Fifteen iron nails, and a big stud of brass, Then into the chamber Rigissa could pass. "
78,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"She sat herself down by the side of the bed, And played with the locks of the young gallant's head. "
79,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"She kissed him full oft on his mouth rosy red, But still he remained as were life from him fled. "
80,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"In her arms the young Stig she so fondly did press, But quiet he lay nor returned her caress. "
81,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Child Stig he awoke, and cast up his eyes: ""Who wakes me from sleep in this manner?"" he cries. "
82,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""If I cannot, Rigissa, my rest for thee take, To the Dane King, thy brother, complaint I will make."" "
83,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""O thou may'st complain if thou feelest inclin'd, But thou art the man on whom standeth my mind."" "
84,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The very next morning ere high was the sun, Child Stig to complain to the Dane King is gone. "
85,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Dear Lord, I have this to complain of to thee, For thy sister at night I at rest cannot be."" "
86,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The King in displeasure his footboy address'd: ""To come to my presence my sister request."" "
87,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Rigissa came in, 'fore the table stood she: ""What mean'st thou, O brother, by sending for me?"" "
88,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""O here is a knight doth complaint of thee make, He cannot at night his repose for thee take."" "
89,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""It is but God's truth that his chamber I sought, But nothing unseemly betwixt us was wrought. "
90,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Steel, glowing steel, I will bear on my hand, And of crime with Child Stig I acquitted will stand."" "
91,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Long stood the Dane King, full of thought was his head: ""With no better man I my sister can wed."" "
92,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"All hearts in the Dane King's palace were gay, The Dane King has given his sister away. "
93,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"There was pleasure and smiling in every look, For his beloved Lady Child Stig the maid took. "
94,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Child Stig he brews ale, and the wine doth prepare, He the Dane King invites to his castle so fair. "
95,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The King and his gallant men all biddeth he, And the Queen of the Danes of the party should be. "
96,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Outspake the fair Queen, on her steed as she rode: ""Methinks I behold of Child Stig the abode."" "
97,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"And thereto the page at her bridle replied: ""Of Stig the brave castle is known far and wide. "
98,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"""Within with the richest of gold it is graced, Without with white silver 'tis all over cased."" "
99,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"And, lo, when the gate of the castle they gained, Five shaggy white bears stood before it enchained. "
100,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"And when in procession they entered the court, Within it the hart and the roebuck did sport. "
101,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"In the midst of the court was a silver trough long, Of birds and of animals round it a throng. "
102,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Above spread the poplar and linden their shade, In its coolness the hart and the little hind played. "
103,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"An apartment they entered, full lofty and fair, Was crowded with women so courtly of air. "
104,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"All of red amber composed was the floor, The roof with gilt letters was written all o'er. "
105,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,The table it was of the red shining gold The napkin of Agerwool rare to behold. 
106,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The walls were constructed of fair marble stone, The beams of the roof of the whitest whale bone. "
107,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"On the floor they are dancing with rapture so high, Tall, slender, and stately Sir Stig dances by. "
108,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Straight and slim as a sapling Child Stig dances up, In each hand holding a fair silver cup. "
109,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Child Stig to the health of his bonny bride quaffed, And forest and meadow delightedly laughed. "
110,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"The forest it bloomed, the boughs leaves put forth-- She excels every damsel in beauty and worth. "
111,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Late in the evening the mist it descends, Child Stig his young bride to her chamber attends. "
112,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"Now gallant Child Stig has o'ercome his distress, He sleeps in the arm of a lovely princess. "
113,CHILD STIG AND CHILD FINDAL,"And Damsel Rigissa is free from her fright, By the side of Child Stig she reposes each night. "
