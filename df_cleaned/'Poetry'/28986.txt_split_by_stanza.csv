1,AND OTHER BALLADS,YOUNG SWAIGDER OR THE FORCE OF RUNES AND OTHER BALLADS 
5,PRINTED FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION,"_Copyright in the United States of America_ _by Houghton_, _Mifflin & Co. for Clement Shorter_. "
7,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"It was the young Swaigder, With the little ball he played; The ball flew into the Damsel's lap, And pale her cheeks it made. "
8,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"The ball flew into the Damsel's bower. He went of it in quest; Before he out of the bower came, Much care had filled his breast! "
9,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""The ball, the ball thou shouldst not fling, Shouldst cast it not at me; There sits a maid in a foreign land, She sighs and weeps for thee. "
10,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Thou never more shalt peace obtain, Or close in sleep thine eyes, Till thou has freed the lovely maid, In thrall for thee that lies."" "
11,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"It was the young Swaigder, Placed his cap upon his head, And into the high chamber Unto his knights he sped. "
12,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Here, quaffing mead from out the shell Sit ye, my Courtmen bold, Whilst I go to the mountain drear, Speech with the Dead to hold! "
13,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Here, quaffing mead and ruddy wine, Sit ye my men so brave, Whilst I go to the mountain drear, With my mother speech to have!"" "
14,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"It was the young Swaigder, And he began to call-- Riven were wall and marble stone, And the hill began to fall. "
15,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Who is it breaks my sleep, And works me such annoy? Deep, deep below the earth so swart Can I not peace enjoy?"" "
16,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""O, it is the young Swaigder, The son thou lovest dear; He fain would good advice from thee, His darling mother, hear. "
17,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""For I have now a step-mother, So harsh she is of mood, And she upon me Runes has cast For a maid I ne'er have view'd."" "
18,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""I will give thee a noble horse, Shall bear thee at thy need, And he will run upon the sea As on the verdant mead. "
19,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""And I will to thee a napkin give, 'Tis of Ager wool entire, Before thee on the board shall stand, What meat thou shalt desire. "
20,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""I will to thee a deer's horn give, Mark well its golden gleam; All the drink thou wishest for, From the golden horn shall stream. "
21,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""And I will give to thee a sword, Hardened in Dragon's blood; It will glitter like a beam When thou ridest through the wood. "
22,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""I will give to thee a barque, Its white sails silk shall be; Shall move as well on the verdant earth As on the foaming sea."" "
23,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Their silken sails on the gilded yard So wide, so wide they spread; Away they sailed to the distant land, Where dwelt the lovely maid. "
24,THE FORCE OF RUNES,And they have cast their anchors Upon the yellow sand; It was the young Swaigder Who stepped the first to land. 
25,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"It was the young Swaigder, His ship to the shore he steers; And the first man there that met him, Was a man of many years. "
26,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"It was then the ancient man Was the first to make enquire: ""O, what is the name of the young swain With the sword, and the look of fire?"" "
27,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""O, he is hight young Swaigder, So wide his fame doth fly; And he for a maid is pining sore On whom he ne'er set eye."" "
28,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""There is within this land a maid, Who pining long hath been For a swain that hight is Swaigder, And him she ne'er has seen."" "
29,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""If longs she after a young swain On whom she ne'er set eye, And he is hight young Swaigder, He is here in verity. "
30,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Now do thou hear, thou ancient man, If it as thou sayest be, Become I King upon this land, I'll make a Count of thee."" "
31,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""'Midst of yonder verdant wood Stands the castle of the maid; The house is of gray marble stone, The court with steel belaid. "
32,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""The house is of grey marble stone The court with steel is floored, The portal is of ruddy gold, Twelve bears before it guard. "
33,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""In middle of the maiden's court A linden spreads its shade, If truly thou art Swaigder, Hie forward unafraid."" "
34,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Away then rode young Swaigder, Cast towards the gate his eye; And all the locks that before it hung, Down fell they instantly. "
35,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Then withered the leaf, then withered the linden, And the grass at the linden's root; And the twelve bears who the portal guard They fell at the hero's foot. "
36,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"When he came into the castle-court, He smoothed his array, Then proudly up to the high, high hall To the King he took his way. "
37,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Hail to thee, hail to thee, heathen King, Who dost at the wide board sit, Wilt thou give me thy daughter fair? Return me an answer fit."" "
38,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""I have no daughter, I have no daughter, No daughter but one have I; And she so sorely longing For a young swain doth lie. "
39,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""For a young swain whom she has never seen My daughter longing lies; The swain he hight is Swaigder, So far his fame it hies."" "
40,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"In went the little serving boy, Wore a kirtle white to see: ""If thou dost long for Swaigder, Know that hither come is he."" "
41,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"In then came the lovely maid, In white silk clad was she: ""Now welcome, welcome my dearest heart, Young Swaigder, welcome be!"" "
42,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Wilt thou consent baptized to be, And the Christian faith receive, And follow me to Denmark With young Swaigder to live?"" "
43,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"""Willingly I baptized will be, Will the Christian faith receive; And will follow thee to Denmark, Young Swaigder, with thee to live."" "
44,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"On a Thursday she baptized was, She the Christian faith received; On a Sunday they their bridal held, And ever in peace they lived. "
45,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"They kept their bridal feast for a day, They kept the same for nine; And there sat waiting the ancient man, And through all of them did pine. "
46,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Be thanks to brave young Swaigder, He kept so well his word; A Knight he made of that ancient man, Set him highest at the board. "
47,THE FORCE OF RUNES,"Now joyful is young Swaigder, His trouble all has fled; He King became upon that land, She Queen, when her sire was dead. "
49,THE HAIL STORM {14},"As in Horunga haven We fed the crow and raven, I heard the tempest breaking Of demon Thorgerd's waking; Sent by the fiend in anger, With din and stunning clangor; To crush our might intended, Gigantic hail descended. "
50,THE HAIL STORM {14},"A pound the smallest pebble Did weigh, and others treble; It drifted, dealing slaughter, And blood ran out like water, Ran recking, red and horrid, From battered cheek and forehead; But, though so rudely greeted, No Jornsberg man retreated. "
51,THE HAIL STORM {14},"With anger ever sharper, Thorgerda fierce, and Yrpr, Shot lightning from each finger, Which sped and did not linger. Then sank our brave in numbers To cold, eternal slumbers; There lay the good and gallant, Renowned for warlike talent. "
52,THE HAIL STORM {14},"To bide the storm unable Our chieftain hewed his cable, And with his ship departed-- We follow, broken-hearted; For in Horunga haven Our bravest feed the raven; We did our best, but no men Can stand 'gainst hail and foemen. "
54,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"In Denmark once a lady dwelt, Hellelil the name she bore; A castle new that lady built, It shone all Denmark o'er. "
55,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Her daughter dear was stolen away, She sought for her far and near; The more she sought the less she found, To her great distress and care. "
56,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"She bid a noble ship be built, Therein gilt masts did stand; With valiant knights and courtmen bold She caused it to be manned. "
57,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Her sons she followed to the strand, With many a fond caress; For eight long years they sailed away, Enduring much distress. "
58,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"For eight years had they sailed away, So long they thought the tide, When they sailed before a lofty hill, And straight to land they hied. "
59,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Then peeped the Damsel Swanelil Forth from the mountain brow: ""O whence can be these stranger swains, As guests that seek us now?"" "
60,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"The youngest brother then replied, So ready of speech was he: ""A widow's three poor sons we are, So long we've sailed the sea. "
61,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Dame Hellelil our mother is, We were born on Denmark's ground; From us our sister stolen was, And her we have yet not found."" "
62,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""If thou wert born on Danish ground, And Dame Hellelil be thy mother Then I thy beloved sister am And thou art my youngest brother. "
63,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Now do thou hear, my youngest brother, Why didst not at home remain? If thou hadst a thousand thousand lives Thou none of them couldst retain."" "
64,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"She placed him in the smallest nook She could in the house espy: She bade him for sake of the highest God, Neither to laugh nor cry. "
65,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Rosmer came from the ocean home, And straight he fell to bann: ""O I can smell by my right hand That here is a Christian man."" "
66,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""A Bird with a dead man's shank in its mouth, Chanced over our house to fly; He cast it in, I cast it out, And that full speedily."" "
67,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"A noble meal she then prepared, And she gave him many a kiss: ""O here is come my sister's son, It would grieve me him to miss. "
68,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""My sister's son is here arrived From the land where I first drew breath; Now give him, my lord, thy firm, firm oath, Thou'lt do unto him no scathe."" "
69,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""If here has come thy sister's son From the native land of both, To do him ne'er any kind of hurt, I swear by my highest oath."" "
70,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"It was the lofty Rosmer King To two serving swains did call: ""Bid ye proud Swanelil's sister's son Attend me in the hall."" "
71,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"It was Swanelil's sister's son, Before Rosmer should appear; His heart it fluttered, his body it shivered, He stood in such mighty fear. "
72,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Then took Rosmer her sister's son, Placed him upon his knee; He stroked him so tenderly on the face That 'twas yellow and blue to see. "
73,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Then answered proud Dame Swanelil: ""Thou forget'st, Sir Rosmer, mayhap, Thou hast not fingers small enough To stroke so little a chap."" "
74,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"And he was there till the years were five, Then he longed for his native land: ""Now cause, O sister Swanelil, That I'm set on the yellow strand."" "
75,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"It was proud Dame Swanelil 'Fore Rosmer goes to stand; ""The swain so long has been by the sea, That he sighs for his native land."" "
76,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""If the swain has been so long by the sea That he sighs for his native land, I will give him a chest of gold, To be subject to his hand."" "
77,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Wilt thou give him a chest of gold, To be subject to his hand? Hear thou now, my noble heart's dear, Take him to his native land."" "
78,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"It was proud Dame Swanelil, So cunning a trick she played; She took thereout the ruddy gold all, And herself in the chest she laid. "
79,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"He took the man upon his back, And the chest in his mouth he's ta'en; And so he went the long, long way Across the land and the main. "
80,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"""Now have I borne thee to thy land, Thou seest both sun and moon; I conjure thee by the highest God Name Swanelil to none."" "
81,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"Rosmer sprang into the sea amain, The water splashed to the sky; And when he came to the mountain home No Swanelil could he spy, "
82,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"When he came to the mountain home Gone was the belov'd of his heart; He sprang so wild about the hill, And changed to a flint rock swart. "
83,ROSMER MEREMAN {16},"There was rejoicing in Hellelil's court, They rejoiced in many a way; Back to their friends her children are come, Who had been so long away. "
86,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"Sir Peter o'er to the island strayed-- _All underneath a linden wide_. He weds Mettelil, so fair a maid-- _In such peril with her through the forest ride_. "
87,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"Bracelets of gold he given her hath, That fills his mother's breast with wrath. "
88,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""If thou wed a maid against my desire, With her first babe she shall expire!"" "
89,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"He weds her and home he her has ta'en, To meet her his mother will not deign. "
90,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"When they together a year had dwelt, Herself with child proud Mettelil felt. "
91,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"Out and in they Mettelil bear, Death has to her approached so near. "
92,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""Since neither live nor die I may, Take me whence a maid ye brought me away."" "
93,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"Thereto the Stepmother made reply, She was tow'rds her disposed maliciously: "
94,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""The horses graze upon the mead, And the coach swains heavy they sleep in bed."" "
95,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"Sir Peter he stood a little apart, Mettelil has so grieved his heart. "
96,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"The coach to her country was turned in haste, And the horses before it were quickly placed. "
97,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"And when they came to the verdant moor, Her chariot broke into pieces four. "
98,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""What mighty crime can I have done, That my own coach 'neath me will not run?"" "
99,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"Sir Peter at no great distance hied, He was so near he all espied. "
100,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""We forthwith will find a remedy, Thou shalt ride and walk will I."" "
101,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""Each noble Dame will know how fit, I am in this plight in the saddle to sit."" "
102,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"Proud Mettelil came to her father's abode, Her father abroad to receive her strode. "
103,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""Welcome, Mettelil, daughter mine, How speedest thou with that burden of thine?"" "
104,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""So speeding am I, such plight I am in, That upon this earth no rest can I win."" "
105,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"Little Kirsten a may was of goodness rife, Dearly she loved her brother's wife. "
106,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"She to her brother was true of heart, Of wax two babes she formed with art. "
107,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"She wrapt them up in the linen fair, And took them beneath her cloak with care. "
108,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"She took them beneath her cloak with care, And them to her mother she straightway bare. "
109,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""My dearest mother, no longer grieve, The babes of your son in your arms receive."" "
110,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""Has Mettelil forth these little sons brought? Then my dark Runes have availed nought. "
111,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""Air and earth I have spelled, save the spot alone, The little spot, my chest stood upon. "
112,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""Oh I enchanted have as wide As she could either walk or ride. "
113,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"""I have enchanted both earth and wood, Save the spot whereon my chest it stood."" "
114,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"No sooner she the words had said, Than proud Mettelil on the place was laid. "
115,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"And when she had come where stood the chest, Straight of two sons was she released. "
116,THE WICKED-STEPMOTHER,"That Sir Peter's mother so mortified, Full quickly of rage and spite she died. "
