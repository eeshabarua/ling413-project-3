Life’s story has a happy hue and the world seems bright, Yes, life is full of sunshine, we can not see the night, And we with hearts all filled with plans, look forward and we see With eyes of hope, our future fights end in a victory.

Instead of all our victories and conquest to attain, Our fight is principally in life, our daily bread to gain. Our plans have all been shattered; castles gone to decay; Our childhood dreams of happiness have long since passed away. No sunshine now we see in life, all is grief and despair, Our joyful dreams of former years turned to trials, toil and care. "

Some of our best days were ill spent in joy and dissipation, Or mayhap some mistake in life, such as missing a vocation. Such things will hover ’round our minds when we have all turned gray, But what’s the use of pining for things long passed away, For if we had the means wherewith, our lives we could relive; We’d do the same and to these same hopes we would a nursing give.

This story of old to me is told ’Midst the roar of the sea and the creak of the mast. Millions have I in my deep bed; millions in silver; millions in gold; Stones that are precious, jewels so rare; Relics of kingdoms beyond compare. Antiques that are centuries old. It was echoes from the sea, whispering to me; Echoes floating out into the air. Stories to me told of wealth and shining gold That are hidden in the mighty ocean there. "

The sea with its might they’d gladly fight, No power on earth could make them fall, But each brave ship, as it came their turn, gave up the fight (if the story be true); Gave up the fight, the echoes say; Ne’er again will they sail so gay. Relinquished all and sank from view. It was echoes from the sea, whispering to me; Echoes floating out into the air. Stories to me told of gallant ships of old That are hidden in the mighty ocean there. "

Those at home they weep and yearn For these gallant tars who’ll not return, But sleep in a watery grave, It was echoes from the sea, whispering to me, Echoes floating out into the air. Stories to me told of sailors brave and bold, That are hidden in that mighty ocean there. "

Its sepulchral silence--naught is heard Save the call of the beast, the song of the bird And the wind in the trees of the mountains. "

You can’t stop its course or bar its route, Love surely will force its own way out; It will come to all, it’s always gay, In hovel or hall, it finds its way. "

When he was stripped to his foolish hide It naturally followed she threw him aside, But memory of happiness still survived-- So some of him lived, if most of him died. "

Then she must go, or the world would scoff If they knew of his love, so he cast her off. He lived alone and he soon grew rich, For he hadn’t been tarred by the vampire’s pitch. To himself he said, he was doing right, Though he craved for her love both day and night-- ’Twas then he sought, as he but knows, For the one he loved in those feminine clothes, And the hank of hair and the bit of bone That had gone her way and left him alone, For she had pride and she’d never forgive-- He never died--for he never did live; He had bowed to the world, had been its tool-- Who was the wise man and who was the fool?

That is the question, Whether ’tis nobler for mind and stomach To suffer pains of outrageous hunger Or get thee to a hasherie in the city, And there to masticate tough meat and pie crust, To eat, to consume stale eggs, to say we end The stomach ache and thousand shocks That flesh is heir to in a boarding house. To eat, to sleep; perchance to dream; aye, there’s the rub, For in that sleep what nightmare dreams may come; When we have conquered our dyspepsia And sought repose upon our bed of corncobs That makes a burden of our righteous life. Who could bear this tantor without demur? The oppressing wrong of the boarding-house mistress, The pangs of a dyspeptic stomach, The insolence of the landlady’s daughter, The stale jokes of her fat husband, The squalls of her sister’s baby, The whistling of her ten-year-old son, The vocalization of the lady in the next room, The violent piano exercise of the widow boarder, When we might seek another place? aye, there’s the respect, Why leave this bedlam, to which no boarder e’er returns? Puzzles the will and makes us rather bear these ills we have, Than fly to those we know not of. Thus hunger makes cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought, And gallantry that strikes us for the moment Is shattered, and in this respect We lose the name of action. "

A feeling of sorrow, then “don’t care,” A little encouragement, then despair; A wish for something we had before That’s passed away to return no more. A selfish sympathy, one’s melancholy, Then tries to cheer up and wants to be jolly. Next, we’re lost in a reverie, The joys of life we can not see. Keep building castles in the air, ’Till finally one thinks he’s a millionaire-- Then we suddenly awake to realize We’re living on earth and not in the skies. "

Who makes the sky, the sea and the land? Who makes the night? Who makes the day? Who cheers the traveler on his way? Who fills the mountains with silver and gold?

I really commenced to think you were dead; Oh! you were going West, I believe you said. Well, to be candid, you’re looking sad, And I must say that your clothes look bad. It’s the same old hat I saw before, Your coat, I see, is somewhat tore. In the knee of your pants another tear, And your shoes, they look the “worse for wear,” And what in the world became of your vest? The young man said, “I’ve been out West.” "

Next, they’ll serve you cornbeef hash Flavored with the cook’s mustache. If in pie there’s button or rim of hat Don’t worry, they charge nothing extra for that. Rates are only three dollars a day, If you want water, by the way, It’s found in the yard where a well they’ve sunk. There’s no place for your clothes, so you live in your trunk. Lots of light, don’t want any more, All comes from the transom over the door. All the advantages one can’t tell That’s found in the good small town hotel. "

As it passes the sun you’ll change your song, And life will not be near so bright. Then we look about through the bright blue sky. There’s no cloud there that we can see.

With my sweetheart in the mountains And out upon the plain, In the country and the city, In the sunshine and the rain. Thinking of the kisses stolen And the kisses you returned, The latter, dear, upon my lips, Indelibly are burned. Thinking, dear, of love’s sweet nothings We’d to each other say, And how we’d sit in silence, Holding hands ’most every day, Thinking of the happiness we’ve had ’Till now I can not see Another girl in all the world That looks so good to me, As my sweetheart in the country, Who stole from me my heart. And then the cruel hour arrived-- The time we had to part. "
179,ACT III--PATHOS,"But what’s the use of talking, I know those days have past. They say that there is happiness That is too good to last. We all must have our troubles; Each must have their share, And each in turn believes their own The hardest ones to bear. So, thinking of the past, tonight, And of the present too, With all my love I fear that I Was never meant for you. "
181,ACT III--PATHOS,"If in life you would succeed, Start in early youth; To this warning now pay heed Always speak the truth. Let others do what e’er they may; In your dealings it will pay To have your neighbors gladly say, You always speak the truth. "
182,ACT III--PATHOS,"It’s your one great asset, boy, Do not be deterred By temptation to deny a truth You’ve said or heard. So be sure, keep this in view; Always be exact and true, And no matter what you do, Never break your word. "
184,ACT III--PATHOS,"Tonight we part forever, though it fills my heart with pain; Love’s ties tonight you sever, my cup of joy you drain. Pondering o’er the past I weep--no smiles for me you’ve shown; Where roses grew now dark weeds creep, and I am sad and lone. "
185,ACT III--PATHOS,"Though tonight we part, I shed no tears, so strange to you ’twill seem, That I think of departed years and all that might have been; Of happy days and faded flowers, of a heart that once was true; Of joyful and dreary hours as I bid you, my love, adieu. "
