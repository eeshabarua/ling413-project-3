1,TWO BALLADS,THE TALE OF BRYNILD AND KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER TWO BALLADS 
4,PRINTED FOR PRIVATE CIRCULATION,"_Copyright in the United States of America_ _by Houghton_, _Mifflin & Co. for Clement Shorter_. "
6,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Sivard he a colt has got, The swiftest 'neath the sun; Proud Brynild from the Hill of Glass In open day he won. "
7,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,Unto her did of knights and swains The very flower ride; Not one of them the maid to win Could climb the mountain's side. 
8,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"The hill it was both steep and smooth; Upon its lofty head Her sire had set her, knight nor swain He swore with her should wed. "
9,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Soon to the Danish monarch's court A messenger repaired, To know if there was any one To try the adventure dared. "
10,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"'Twas talked about, and Sivard then His purpose soon made known; Said he: ""I'll try upon my colt To bring Brynilda down."" "
11,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"He rode away, the way was far, The path was of the worst; He saw the shining Glass Hill, where The maid her durance curs'd. "
12,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"And he away proud Brynild bore, Nor deemed the adventure hard; To bold Sir Nielus her he gave To show him his regard. "
13,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Proud Brynild and proud Signelil Those maids of beauteous mien, Down to the river's side they went Their silken robes to clean. "
14,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Now do thou hear, thou proud Brynild, What now I say to thee, Where didst thou get the bright gold ring I on thy finger see?"" "
15,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""How did I get the bright gold ring Which on my hand you see? That gave me Sivard Snareswayne, When he betrothed me."" "
16,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""And though young Sivard gave thee that When he his love declar'd, He gives thee to Sir Nielus now In proof of his regard."" "
17,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"No sooner than did Brynild hear, The haughty hearted may, Than to the chamber high she went, Where sick of rage she lay. "
18,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"It was the proud Brynild there Fell sick, and moaning lay; And her the proud Sir Nielus then Attended every day. "
19,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Now hark to me, thou Brynild fair, My mind is ill at ease; Know'st thou of any medicine Can cure thy sad disease? "
20,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""If there be aught this world within Can make thee cease to moan, That thou shalt have, e'en if it cost All, all the gold I own."" "
21,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""I know of nought within this world Can do my sickness good, Except of Sivard Snareswayne It be the hated blood. "
22,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""And there is nothing in this world Which can assuage my pain, Except of Sivard Snareswayne The head I do obtain."" "
23,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""To draw of Sivard Snareswayne The blood I have no might; His neck is hard as burnished steel, No sword thereon will bite."" "
24,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""O hark, Sir Nielus, hark to me, My well beloved lord, Borrow of him his Adelring, His famous trusty sword. "
25,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Tell him thou needest it so oft When thou dost wage a fight, But soon as 'tis within thy hand Hew off his head outright."" "
26,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"It was the bold Sir Nielus then His mantle puts he on; To Sivard, his companion true, To the high hall he's gone. "
27,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Now hear, O Sivard Snareswayne, Thy sword unto me lend, For I unto the field of fight Full soon my course must bend."" "
28,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""My trusty faulchion Adelring I'll freely lend to thee; No man be sure shall thee o'ercome, However strong he be. "
29,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""My trusty faulchion Adelring To thee I'll freely yield, But, oh! beware thee of the tears Beneath the hilt conceal'd. "
30,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Beware thee of those frightful tears, They all are bloody red; If down thy fingers they should run Thou wert that moment dead."" "
31,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Upstood the bold Sir Nielus then, Drew out the sword amain; One blow and off the head is hewn Of Sivard Snareswayne. "
32,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Beneath his mantle then he takes The head, distilling blood, And hurrying to the chamber high Before Brynilda stood. "
33,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Behold the head, the bloody head, Thou didst so crave to gain; For thee I've done a felon deed Which gives my heart such pain."" "
34,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""O lay aside the bloody head, It fills my heart with fright; And come to me, my dearest lord, Beneath the linen white."" "
35,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""I crave thee, woman, not to think I came for sport and play; Thou wast the wicked cause that I From honour went astray."" "
36,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,It was the bold Sir Nielus then His faulchion he drew out; It was the beauteous Brynild whom He all to pieces smote. 
37,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"""Now have I slain my comrade dear, And eke my lovely may, Yet still I am resolved in mind A third, a third to slay."" "
38,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"So then against the hard stone floor He placed the trusty glaive; To his heart's root the point in went, And him his death wound gave. "
39,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"'Twere better that this maid had died Within her mother's womb, Than that these princely men through her To such an end should come. "
40,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Now will I rede, each honest man Well to deliberate ever; Unequalled woman's cunning is, Though guiles of men be clever. "
41,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"She laughs when 'tis her wish to laugh, And weeps when she will weep; Whene'er she wants thy heart to move Fair words on thee she'll heap. "
42,THE TALE OF BRYNILD,"Be she sick, or be she well, In woman ne'er confide; In murder red, by woman led, His hands Sir Nielus dyed. "
44,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"See, see, with Queen Sophy sits Valdemar bold. About little Kirsten much parlance they hold. "
45,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Now hark, my good Lord! I have this to propose, That thou shalt give Kirsten to Buris for spouse. "
46,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"A sister thou hast, I a brave brother own, A wedding we'll have ere this good year be flown."" "
47,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""It never shall happen, as long as I live, That I to a horse-thief my sister will give. "
48,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"My sister's a princess so fair and so bright, But Buris is liker a groom than a knight."" "
49,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Then pale as a corpse grew Sophia to see; ""My noble lord, wherefore despisest thou me?"" "
50,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The Queen struck with fury her hand on the board: ""Be sure that I vengeance will have for that word."" "
51,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"King Valdemar now to the war-field should wend, Behind stays Sir Buris the land to defend. "
52,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Forth, forth from the land the bold King his course bent, So many a beautiful knight with him went. "
53,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Him followed so many a chivalrous band; He disposed of his sister, the fair mirror's hand. "
54,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To a prince rich and fine and of valour approved, He gave little Kirsten, his sister beloved. "
55,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"With Buris Sophia sits over the board, And much brooded she on King Valdemar's word. "
56,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Sir Buris, my brother, list thou to my say: Beguile the King's sister whilst he is away."" "
57,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Sir Buris he cast on his sister his eyes: ""O why my dear sister dost talk in this guise? "
58,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To do such an act I will never consent, To make her my wife is my wish and intent."" "
59,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The Queen with her hand struck the table with force: ""Just, just as I bid thee direct thou thy course."" "
60,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"His mantle of azure Sir Buris puts on, And unto the princess Sir Buris is gone. "
61,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"With prayers late and early the maiden he tired, But could not obtain from her what he desired. "
62,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Sir Buris, why seekest thou me to betray? To my brother for this thou must answer some day."" "
63,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"With ghastly white cheek did Sir Buris depart, The maiden he loved from the depths of his heart. "
64,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Sir Buris flung on him his scarlet array, And unto Sophia with speed took his way: "
65,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""The princess so firm and determined I find, No knight in this world can e'er conquer her mind."" "
66,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""A pretty man, thou, to take love-work in hand, If the powerful Runes thou dost not understand."" "
67,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""To the paths of fidelity I will return, No wish do I feel your Rune-magic to learn. "
68,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"King Valdemar left his domain to my care, Shall I in return his dear sister ensnare?"" "
69,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O I will for thee the Rune-characters trace, And thou them shalt cast in convenient place."" "
70,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Sir Buris has cast the Rune-letters, alas, On the bridge over which little Kirsten should pass. "
71,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Little Kirsten with anguish was filled, and with care, Must spite of herself to Sir Buris repair. "
72,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"She knocked with her hand on the thick oaken door: ""Sir Buris, arise, let me into thy bower."" "
73,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Upstood then Sir Buris, in scarlet array'd, And straight he admitted the beautiful maid. "
74,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The whole night she lay in Sir Buris' embrace, All to her own sorrow and daily distress. "
75,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Now on towards summer and autumn it drew, So stout in the waist little Kirsten she grew. "
76,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Her true waiting maid little Kirsten address'd: ""To the chamber of stone now convey me in haste. "
77,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"And there unto me do thou bring the mid-wife But let not the Queen know thereof for thy life."" "
78,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To her little foot-swain little Kirsten did say: ""Fetch hither Sir Buris, withouten delay."" "
79,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"They met on the lofty hall's high balcony, Together discoursed they so sorrowfully. "
80,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"They gave then each other a tender caress, And swooned to the earth from of grief the excess. "
81,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The year has revolved, and home now from the fray, King Valdemar cometh triumphant and gay. "
82,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"In, in through the portal King Valdemar strode, Sophia received him in complaisant mode. "
83,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"About and around him King Valdemar stared: ""Say! where is my sister, and how has she fared?"" "
84,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Then sly 'neath her scarlet laughed Sophy the Queen: ""It is full three months now since thy sister I've seen."" "
85,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Sophia exclaim'd: ""She is not to be taught, My advice and monition she holdeth at naught."" "
86,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O why dost thou thus of my sister complain? In honour she liv'd without ever a stain."" "
87,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""The chamber of stone she has long made her home, There she of a little child light has become."" "
88,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Then the heart of the monarch was smitten with grief: ""To thy words, O Sophia, I yield no belief."" "
89,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""The blessed Lord's truth and no lie have I told, She invited me e'en her child-birth to behold."" "
90,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To five of his good knights spake sternly the King: ""Depart, and my sister straight home to me bring."" "
91,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The knights rode away as King Valdemar said, Much rather, much rather, would they have been dead. "
92,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"They struck on the door 'neath their mantle of skin: ""Sweet princess Kirstina, arise, let us in."" "
93,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To the chamber straight came the true serving lass: ""We crave thy leave into the chamber to pass."" "
94,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O sirs, ye may enter as free as the morn, For nobody here any baby has borne."" "
95,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Then in sorrowful mood good Sir Peter replied: ""God grant that thy words I may see verified."" "
96,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Arise, little Kirsten, thyself quick array, For thou to thy brother this night must away. "
97,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Array thyself quick, for in hurry we are, Thy brother the King has returned from the war."" "
98,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Alack, I dare venture my gold coronet, That I shall my death by this night-journey get. "
99,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""My daughter now take, and in linen enfold, The face of her mother no more she'll behold. "
100,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Assist ye my daughter to Christentie's breast, I fear that her luck will not be of the best. "
101,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Let the name that ye give her be proud Ingerlill, My fortune intends for me nothing but ill."" "
102,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Little Kirsten her faithful maid servant address'd: ""Now fetch to me hither, I pray, my gilt chest."" "
103,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The chest she unlocked where lay stored all her gear, And distributed that midst her servants so dear. "
104,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"And most to her maid she thought fit to award, For she was to be her child's teacher and guard. "
105,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The gold, the red gold, she has given her so free, That tender and kind to her child she might be. "
106,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Every lady can well imagine how fit At present I am on my courser to sit. "
107,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""And each man, I am sure, can imagine how ill A journey nocturnal agree with me will."" "
108,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"On the saddle they placed her, with hearts full of care, Glittered like the spun gold her beautiful hair. "
109,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"And when they arrived at the lofty castelle, Down, down from her horse little Kirstenlill fell. "
110,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"At the window the Queen stood and laughed with delight: ""Come hither and view of your sister the plight."" "
111,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To lift her from the ground little Knud was not slow: ""In the name of Lord Jesus the whole truth avow."" "
112,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"They helped her the stairs of the hall to ascend: ""Now thee to the powerful Christ we commend."" "
113,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"In the doorway she crossed herself thrice on the breast: ""To Christ I commend me, the mighty and blest."" "
114,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Then in through the door little Kirsten she wends, And his white hand to her the bold monarch tends. "
115,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Then unto her brother she gives her fair hand: "" I joy much to see thee returned to the land."" "
116,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Much favour and friendship to her he display'd And that Queen Sophia so furious made. 
117,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The king to the brim filled a beaker with wine: ""I beg of thee drink to me, dear sister mine!"" "
118,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Now hear, little Kirsten, what I to thee say, Thou shalt sing before me some pretty love-lay."" "
119,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""I never in all my life learnt a love-lay, But I'll sing another as well as I may."" "
120,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O thou with thy dancing, and eke with thy voice, The hearts of my guests shalt this evening rejoice."" "
121,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To sing then a song little Kirsten began, To the tune danced so many a bold knightly man. "
122,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The King himself sprang 'mid the dancers' gay band, And his sister he took by the lilly-fair hand. "
123,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"He out and in with her eagerly danced, But nothing amiss in her movements he glanced. "
124,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"So often the King proved the voice of the maid, And still to her gait more attention he paid. "
125,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"And the King measured her by the girdle with care, But still he of nothing amiss was aware. "
126,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O Sophia, may thee shame and evil betide, My dear little Kirsten thou'st foully belied."" "
127,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""It is the Lord's truth that I've told, and no lie, She has brought forth a daughter in secrecy."" "
128,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The Queen has yet worse little Kirsten distrest, Her two lovely breasts she tore out from her vest. "
129,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"And, craving her ruin, with hand resolute She pressed out the milk before Valdemar's foot. "
130,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"She pressed out the milk 'fore the King on the floor: ""My King and my husband, canst doubt any more?"" "
131,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Then black as the earth grew King Valdemar's face, And Kirstenlil swooned 'neath the load of disgrace. "
132,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""I intended to wed thee but full speedily, Now thou shalt this evening with agony die. "
133,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""To a mighty lord I'd resolv'd thee to espouse, Now this very night thy young life thou shalt lose. "
134,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""The death the most cruel and painful of all, This night thou shalt suffer in this very hall."" "
135,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Little Kirsten she fell 'fore the King on her knee: ""Dear brother! I pray shew some pity to me."" "
136,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Thy kneeling, O Kirsten, will profit thee nought, The basest and vilest of sins thou hast wrought. "
137,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"'Tis folly to hope I shall mercy display, Thou injured me hast in such infamous way. "
138,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"I promised thy hand, for of this nought I knew, To the son of a king 'cross the Haf's water blue."" "
139,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"He turned to the foot-swain who stood at his side: "" Fetch hither five horse-whips,"" King Valdemar cried. "
140,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Little Kirsten she fell down upon her bare knee: ""Now mighty Lord God! look with mercy on me."" "
141,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""For four whips or five whips thou needest not send, One will be quite enough to bring me to my end."" "
142,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The King in his hand the horse-scourges has ta'en, His bosom with sorrow was filled, and with pain. "
143,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,""" Rise, rise Queen Sophia! and beg for me now, For brought me to this have thy brother and thou."" "
144,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Little worthy were I of the title of Queen, Were I to essay such a harlot to screen."" "
145,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""I'll punish her so, though I love her full dear, That all shall thereof with astonishment hear."" "
146,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"He lashed her so long, and he lashed her so sore, That grovelling she lay in a stream of red gore. "
147,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"She crept for defence 'neath Sophia's array, With her foot she with vehemence spurned her away. "
148,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O 'neath your red scarlet my poor body hide, For the sake of the Christ who for us sinners died. "
149,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"I let fall so many a big briny tear, God's mercy upon me! my fate has been drear. "
150,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"O brother, O brother, your cruel hand stay, For a moment, that soul-gifts distribute I may. "
151,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"I give to thyself all my castles so grand, Because that my life thou dost hold in thy hand. "
152,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To my daughter so dear my red gold I bequeath, For she shall cause vengeance be ta'en for my death. "
153,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"I give to Queen Sophy my silver-cased knife, Because she it was who betrayed my young life. "
154,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"O Buris! God give thee misery smart, Enveloped with care the most black is my heart. "
155,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"And now I've my testament made to my mind, Dear brother, prove towards me forgiving and kind. "
156,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"I to Christ give my soul, may he shew it good grace, There's no one, I trow, cares for me in this place."" "
157,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,She bade all good night that around her she spied. And all for the damsel so piteously cried. 
158,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"For her wept every dame, for her wept every maid, All wept save Sophia, that vile wicked jade. "
159,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Then yielded the roselet her innocent sprite, To God she commended it as it took flight. "
160,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"O then was King Vald'mar with sorrow opprest, And wildly his heart 'gan to knock in his breast. "
161,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""What a hard hearted wretch thou, O Sophy, must be, That thou her distress without pity could see. "
162,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Shame upon thee, thou basest of all womankind, Thou now hast obtained the great wish of thy mind. "
163,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Alack! well a day, my dear sister is dead; Now where shall we bury the rose-flower red?"" "
164,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""In Riber street, Sir, let thy flower repose, That o'er her may tread every day my horse-shoes."" "
165,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""O never shalt thou have the joy, that thy horse Shall tread o'er the ground which concealth her corse. "
166,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To Vestervig's cloister her corse shall be sent, O'er her shall be placed a red brick monument."" "
167,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"He caused her be buried with grandeur and state, All the days of his life the King sighed for her fate. "
168,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Now I will retire to a chamber of gloom, A chamber which fire nor light shall illume. "
169,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"There ne'er shall the blest sun on me cast its ray, Till I've through repentance my sins wiped away."" "
170,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To his page the King spake with so serious an air: ""Command thou Sir Buris to me to repair. "
171,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Hark, hark thou, Sir Knight, what I now say to thee, How hast thou been found in thy duty to me? "
172,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"I left thee a vine-yard for thee to watch o'er, Therein hast thou done me an injury sore. "
173,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The loveliest vine in the vineyard that stood, That hast thou destroyed to thy own little good."" "
174,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Sir Buris he fell on his knee 'fore the King: ""My dear lord and master, O pardon this thing."" "
175,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""No, thou too shalt suffer both torment and shame, To a sharp shameful death through thy treachery she came."" "
176,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""The cruellest death ye for me can invent, To thou for the beautiful maid I'm content."" "
177,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Let the eyes of the horse-thief be torn from his head, Because he the beautiful damsel betray'd."" "
178,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"They've torn from the sockets Sir Buris's eyes, In spite of Queen Sophy's entreaties and cries. "
179,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"Sir Buris' right hand, and Sir Buris' left foot, King Valdemar caused to be hewn off to boot. "
180,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"From the Castle the knight they led forth on the green, In mockery and scoff of Sophia the Queen. "
181,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"""Behold now thy brother, that lord great and fine, Who fain as a prince and a monarch would shine!"" "
182,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"The Dane-king a fetter has caused to be made, On Buris in Vestervig cloister 'twas laid. "
183,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"For eleven long years there was Sir Buris confin'd, Each day to her grave went the knight lame and blind. "
184,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,Each day that he lived of the King did he crave That beside her when dead they might lay him in grave. 
185,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,"To the King he was forced to give land and domain, Ere to rest in the cloister the boon he could gain. "
186,KING VALDEMAR AND HIS SISTER,He expired just as the twelfth year was begun-- The King never smiled Queen Sophia upon. 
188,MIRROR OF CINTRA,"_Translated from the original Portuguese on a marble slab in the garden of Don Juan De Castro_,_ at Cintra_. "
189,MIRROR OF CINTRA,"Tiny fields in charming order, Which the jagged forests border; Sheltered valleys downward wending, 'Midst the rocks to heaven ascending; Silvery fountains turbid never, Foliage dense which bloometh ever; Ceaseless Zephyrs gently playing, Satyrs, fawns by thousands straying; Nymphs, with fair bewitching faces, Form of Cintra's clime the graces. "
193,THE HARP,"The harp to every one is dear Who hateth vice, and all things evil; Hail to its gentle voice so clear, Its gentle voice affrights the Devil! "
194,THE HARP,"The Devil can not the Minstrel quell-- He by the Minstrel is confounded; From Saul was cast the spirit fell, When David's harp melodious sounded. "
