15,PREFACE.,"During the past quarter of a century, it has been a pleasant pastime for me to obey the dictates of my feelings and inscribe them upon paper. "
16,PREFACE.,"The present volume is a collection of these vagrant pastimes, some of which have wandered far, while others have never before appeared to any eye save the writer's. "
17,PREFACE.,"To call them home, introduce them to each other, and properly house them, seems a parental duty. "
18,PREFACE.,"If in them there is a thought that shall inspire others of my profession to feel the dignity and responsibility of the calling, their publication will not have been in vain. "
22,THIS VOLUME IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED.,"TO THE MEMORY OF MY MOTHER, WHOSE DEVOTION, ENERGY, AND PERSEVERANCE LED ME TO DRINK AT THE FOUNTAIN OF KNOWLEDGE AND TRUTH, UNTIL I SAW BEAUTY THEREIN, THIS VOLUME IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED. "
23,THIS VOLUME IS AFFECTIONATELY DEDICATED.,"The true end of life is to elevate man In body, in mind, and in spirit, That here he may serve some beneficent plan, Then a mansion in heaven inherit. "
135,INVOCATION TO THE MUSE.,"Didactic muse Calliope, Expand thy soothing silent wings, Touch chords of measured harmony Wherein the soul ecstatic sings, Let language fraught with living truth Find such expression by thy art, As shall assist the guides of youth To fire the soul and win the heart. "
136,INVOCATION TO THE MUSE.,"Remove the barriers which so long Have held in thraldom many a mind, Sing to the deaf a ransom-song, Be eyes to those whose souls are blind; Teach those who mould the plastic mind To know that God hath never given A mission weightier, more refined, To angels round the courts of heaven, Than that of training human minds Committed unto human hands, In which the spirit e'er survives And through eternity expands. "
137,INVOCATION TO THE MUSE.,"Paint truthfully the living dead Whose sensibilities were slain By tyros, oft unskilled, unread, In all the workings of the brain; Whose concepts of the avenues That reach the mind of tender youth, Are labyrinths of tangled views Devoid of art, science, and truth; Touch but that chord of magic power Which gives the soul augmented bliss, And lifts it for the present hour Above the world's base selfishness; Then let the search-light of the soul Illumine every page that's read, Until an animated whole Shall supersede the living dead. "
138,INVOCATION TO THE MUSE.,"Then, then shall dawn the golden day When Ignorance shall shamed-faced fly Before the potent living ray Of mind, touched by effulgency That pours its light in vital force, Upon the mind of plastic youth, And leads it gently to the source Of light and scientific truth. "
140,OUR PROFESSION.,"There's an art in our profession, Which cannot be wholly learned From all books in our possession, Though their leaves be deftly turned Till the mind shall grasp the meaning Of each truth they may contain, Yet there remains a gleaning Not a product of the brain. "
141,OUR PROFESSION.,"One may know the truths of science Till his mind may have full store, Or may place some great reliance On ancient and modern lore; He may count the stars in heaven, He may trace them in their course, And from data that is given He may prove creation's source; He may use the best of diction To portray his studied thought; He may draw from truth and fiction All the charm with which they're fraught; He may be a friend of Nature And may understand her laws; He may prove embryo creature Has within itself a ""cause""; He may fathom all creation And dwell among the stars, Visit every land and nation And return with honor's scars; Yet he may lack a power,-- Occult to scientific truth-- Which is Heaven's richest dower To the guides of ardent youth. "
142,OUR PROFESSION.,"Though all these may give a polish To the gem that lights the soul, They are weak, useless, and foolish, When they're taken for the whole Of all the powers required To entrance the youthful mind, With a spirit so inspired As to touch the eyes of blind With a bright illumination That shall prove itself to be More than a corruscation Of a short-lived ecstasy. "
143,OUR PROFESSION.,"By intuition, children know A heart that cares for them; They recognize a friend or foe, At instantaneous ken. No mask can shield a fraud or fool, E'en from a puerile mind; It knows by rules not learned at school The way true hearts to find. An earnest love, unbounded, firm,-- A God-gift from our birth-- By far outweighs the noblest charm Can be acquired on earth. "
144,OUR PROFESSION.,"Who has not drunk deep at the well Of childhood's innocence, Or thinks that he should ever dwell At such an eminence, That he can never bend to raise And cheer a longing heart, Will waste his precious hours and days, And finally depart Without such fruitage or reward As ever should be given To him, who serves master or Lord, And hopes for bliss in heaven. "
145,OUR PROFESSION.,"Who sees no soul-buds here expand To blossom by and by, Hath fathomed not the great command For which we live and die. The State demands that every son And daughter shall be free From ignorance and vice which run Toward crime and misery. The future of our noble State Dwells now in plastic form; If she her past would emulate And meet the coming storm Of chaos, whose portentous wing Seems hovering not afar, In every school-room we should sing Of banner and of star That gave the land to Liberty, And with a bold huzza Proclaim that he who would be free Must honor right and law. "
146,OUR PROFESSION.,"Who serves his State and fellow-man And plies his skill at best, Assists to carry out the plan To make all truly blest; He may not sit in marble hall Where legislators meet, Nor may he rear fine towers tall, Or dwell in a retreat Where monks and nuns with solemn prayer Pour out their orison; The test of faith is filial care, And duty nobly done. Minds let us mould, men may we rear, For God, for State, for man, Using the right without a fear To mar the heaven-born plan. "
147,OUR PROFESSION.,"The test of great didactic skill Is not to train the few Whose active genius, tact, and will Are always plain to view; But he who takes an inert mind, Housed in a sluggish frame, And forms such man as God designed, Deserves an honored name. "
148,OUR PROFESSION.,"Like Sisyphus some ever roll The same old round of things Which dwarf the mind and starve the soul, Until they long for wings To fly from dull monotony, Which carries in its train That wreck of thought--Despondency-- Which preys on heart and brain. "
149,OUR PROFESSION.,"The artist knows the colors best That blend in harmony With richest cloud-scenes, in the west, That gild the sunset sky; The minstrel knows what song to sing To please the multitude; His fingers deftly touch the strings That yield response subdued When weary soul would find relief From sorrow's withering sigh, Or when the heart is bowed with grief, And tear-drops dew the eye; But when the soul is full of joy, How jubilant the strain The tactful artist will employ To please the heart and brain. "
150,OUR PROFESSION.,"If those who toil in lowly spheres Employ such artful ways To charm the dull and listless ears That such may sound their praise, Why should the artist of the mind Shrink from that noble aim That seeks to elevate mankind, And light a deathless flame! Or why should he who shapes the lives And destiny of man, Be less exact than he who strives From mercenary plan. "
151,OUR PROFESSION.,"No instrument man ever made-- None ever can be found-- No matter when or where 'tis played, Will yield so rich a sound As that which falls from human tongue When heart speaks unto heart, Nor are its mysteries among The hidden things of art; A tyro on life's winding road Reads understandingly Each tone and word, each varied mode The tongue and form portray. "
152,OUR PROFESSION.,"Our heart's intents are from our looks More plainly to be read, Than thoughts expressed in printed books Whose language oft seems dead, Because it lacks a living form-- A voiceless, dull decree That of itself has little charm For youth's activity. "
153,OUR PROFESSION.,"A potent charm of living light Flows with resistless force, Dispelling clouds of mental night That meet its onward course, When all the soul is centred in The great and primal thought That services which hearts would win, With price can ne'er be bought. Such service heaven alone repays E'en though on earth 'tis done, Its echoes last through endless days, And dies but with the sun. A mercenary soul must find A more congenial field Than that of training human mind Wherein a soul's concealed, If it would live out all the days Allotted unto man, And bask in all the genial rays Revealed in God's great plan. "
154,OUR PROFESSION.,"No lubrication of the nerves Has ever yet been found, For him who like a menial serves Dull lesson's daily round; But gnawing friction, stern and gaunt, Tears flesh and brain away, While ghosts nocturnal ever haunt A soul with fell dismay, Whose mercenary greed has led Itself into a snare That counts by scores its strangled dead, Its hundreds, in despair. "
155,OUR PROFESSION.,"He doubly lives who can forget Himself and his own ease, While toiling patiently to set New gems in crowns he sees, That may adorn some other head Than that he calls his own, And animate the germs wide spread In seeds already sown. "
157,OUR PROFESSION.,"To skim the surface of knowledge, And seldom its root to reach, Is a recipe one may offer To direct ""How Not To Teach."" "
159,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"I know of no profession 'Mong profane or divine, Excelling in its mission The power embraced in mine. "
160,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"It reaches earth and heaven Through heart and soul of man, It lives beyond the present-- Eternity doth span. "
161,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"Mind in its first formation, While in its plastic state, Receives primal impressions Which make it vile or great. "
162,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"When soil of thought is fertile And ready for the seeds, It may bring precious fruitage, Or vile and noxious weeds. "
163,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"No sower should be careless, For harvest much depends Upon the well-selected seeds, With mental soil he blends. "
164,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"If field be rich and mellow And no good seed be sown, With tangled mass of vileness It will be overgrown, "
165,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"And shield the deadly serpent, The basilisk of sin, That far exhales its pois'nous breath, Then crawls its den within. "
166,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"No atoms of pollution In matter e'er was known, So vile or so destructive As soul by sin o'erthrown. "
167,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"The vilest spot upon the earth, Through sunshine, air, and rain, May be transformed in ev'ry part And purified again. "
168,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"The fields where chaos reigned supreme And Nature frowned aghast, By patient-toil have fruitage borne And blossomed fragrance cast. "
169,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"The wreck of spheres by traction's laws Hurled wildly into space, May gather atoms round itself And find some resting place "
170,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"Where it may serve creation's end, And 'mong the planets roll, True to the laws of gravity That marks its outer pole. "
171,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"The mind and soul can never Within themselves find rest, When all the sin's pollutions Are harbored in the breast. "
172,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"Then sow good seed, brave teacher, And deeply plant with care, That both here and hereafter Rich harvest it may bear. "
173,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"The sowing may be silent-- It may be but a tear, Its strength is in its purpose, Its aim must be sincere. "
174,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"It should not be a rite or creed, But wider far than these, It should encompass God and man, Home and antipodes. "
175,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"To learn the truths of science, Know tables, books and charts, To analyze the potent thrill That fires all earnest hearts, "
176,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"To revel in the mysteries That lie deep in the earth, To give the proper data When planets had their birth, "
177,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"To know the exact elements That constitute the sun, The causes why swift currents Within the ocean run, "
178,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"The ratio of the vapors That color sunset skies, Time's infinitesimal fraction When planets set and rise, "
179,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"To solve the problems of the air, The secrets of the deep, Are all intrinsic subjects And worthy of our keep. "
180,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"But these alone are worthless, They need augmented force To lead mind toward the fountain From which it had its source. "
181,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"They leave one vital question-- Development of man-- Without e'en crude solution, Without a working plan. "
182,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"They leave the mighty problem Of Maker and the Made, Devoid of any sequence, Or any plan portrayed. "
183,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"These are of greatest moment To persons and to State, Upon their wise adjustment Must hang progression's fate. "
184,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"Cold are the truths of science, Lifeless their every plan, Until in living presence, They're crystalized in man. "
185,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"As hidden truths are useless And aid not human skill, So slumber mighty forces Through lack of human will. "
186,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"To know the right is not enough, It must be given power Through culture of the heart and soul, If it shall blessings shower. "
187,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"To State, to manhood and to God Must mind be wholly given, Ere truth will shine a beacon light, To illumine earth and heaven. "
188,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"All things were made but to subserve Man's powers to improve, And beautify his being here Through charity and love. "
189,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"Power, gold, and wealth are agencies Placed in a creature's hand To serve an end, but not to rule,-- Obey, but not command. "
190,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"As mind and soul matter surpass And error flies from truth, So should we train the nobler parts Of plastic, trusting youth. "
191,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"The sacred man by God ordained, Links sinful earth with heaven, But his success oft must depend On how instruction's given. "
192,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"The holy task of training mind Is not a trivial thing, Its influence lives, grows and expands Till harvest it shall bring. "
193,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"No task, to human hands assigned, Excels in force and weight The grave responsibilities Of those who educate. "
194,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"Let knowledge of the sciences, Skill in didactic art, Power in the impulse of the soul A knowledge to impart, "
195,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"A love for God and human kind, Forgetfulness of self, A heart devoted to the cause More than to worldly pelf, "
196,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"Be given as a heritage To those who fain would teach, Then living truth shall flourish, And all mankind shall reach. "
198,NEEDS AND POWERS.,"There's an ebb and flow of sentiment In educational tides, Which oft discards some solid old facts, And on wild new hobbies rides. The educator of modern times Must prove the false and the true, Hold fast the worthy of the old, Unprejudiced, test the new. "
200,COURAGE AND FAITH.,"Courage and Faith are of heavenly birth, Though sent down to our lowly earth To cheer the heart of man; They are only strong when the human soul Yields perfect trust and full control To heaven's benignant plan. "
201,COURAGE AND FAITH.,"Nature expands when this God-sent pair Finds a fertile heart that needs the care Of a messenger divine, And permits their strength to succor give That truth may grow and honor live To yield their fruit benign. "
203,COURAGE AND FAITH.,"Who gives no sunshine from his soul Must live in darkness ever, For Nature scorns to such degree, She blinds a sordid giver. "
204,COURAGE AND FAITH.,"But he who scatters noble deeds, And lives to bless mankind, Shall see the beauties God reveals To men with hearts refined. "
206,INCOMPETENCE.,"Sometimes our soul within us burns To see dark Ignorance aspire To move toward light a mind that yearns For knowledge that may lift it higher Upon the royal road of truth, While every word and act and thought Betrays an atmosphere so fraught With lack of common sense and lore, We plead for some almighty power To save from such our precious youth. "
207,INCOMPETENCE.,"No ray of truth can ever shine To beautify and make divine The heart and mind of anxious soul, When doubts and fears have full control Of him who knows he blindly leads. If human minds and souls and hearts May not command those who have arts And power to waken, lead, inspire, Then knowledge fails of her desire, And Ignorance on Wisdom feeds. "
208,INCOMPETENCE.,"Let science, art, didactic skill, Be guided by unyielding will Born in some earnest, patient one Whose heart glows like the summer sun And warms all by its ardent fire; Whose interest is so intense It readily itself imprints Upon the tender minds of youths, Precepts and scientific truths Such as their yearning hearts desire. "
209,INCOMPETENCE.,"Then there shall come a brighter day, When darkness shall to light give way, And Wisdom on her throne rejoice, And speak with accent in her voice That charms and cheers a hungry mind. Then, students, beauty shall receive Instead of ashes that deceive, Their days and nights of earnest toil, Their struggles by the midnight oil Give recompense complete, refined. "
211,FACT VERSUS FORM.,"As shadows are to material forms, As mists to the copious shower As dead calms are to tornado storms That in tropical region lower So are educational fallacies That ignore and decry as naught The value and power that ever lie In the scope of original thought. "
212,FACT VERSUS FORM.,"No smooth device with a soulless form Should obscure the living thought; It smothers the mind, destroys the charm That comes to him who has wrought To discover new truth, by a truth well known, On which he may safely build, Till his mental strength by use has grown To a giant strong and skilled. "
213,FACT VERSUS FORM.,"When thought is secure, the reason clear, And the language to tell is pure, Abridgement comes like a friend sincere, For it cannot the mind obscure. The wasted time on a form-clad task Steals gems from youth's precious years, Leaves a wreck on life's shore, we cannot mask With our sorrows and sighs and tears. "
214,FACT VERSUS FORM.,"If what we have learned has given no power To acquire what yet we must learn, If all our past struggles leave not a dower To which we may joyously turn And feel that a strength within us is given Through efforts already bestowed, In vain have we lived, in vain have we striven, Each task is the same weary load. "
215,FACT VERSUS FORM.,"If task of to-day shall not lighten th' one May come upon us to-morrow, It is but a proof our work was ill done, And bodes to us grief and sorrow. Ev'ry effort of mind applied aright Augments the mental perception, For God aids the brave, and giveth a light To shine away imperfection. "
216,FACT VERSUS FORM.,"There's a magic power in a task well done, There's a charm in solid reason, There's a mighty force in a victory won, Which an alert mind will seize on, And with giant strength that is thus acquired March on till the fields of science And the zones of thought wherein man aspired Shall be won by self-reliance. "
218,INTEREST.,"Who has not seen the inert mind, Bowed down and sore oppressed, Start into life, and vigor find At touch of interest Some sympathetic soul has shown, By look in kindness given, Or word whose accent, cadence, tone, Gave joy akin to heaven? "
219,INTEREST.,"No emanation from the heart Has greater power to win, Than that which lays aside all art And quietly steps in To soothe through sympathy, the cares And sorrows, one by one, Of timorous soul who scarcely dares Go forward all alone, "
220,INTEREST.,"But needs some word of magic power To give him life and zest, Some animating heart-given dower Whose wealth is interest. Few, few there are who know the force That dormant lies in many a brain, Who trace inertia to its source Or see how mind o'er mind may reign. "
222,MEMORY AND REASON.,"Who stores the mind with richest truth Gathered from sages of all lands, May toil through days of sunny youth, And on till Death gives his commands, But fails to call to him the aid Of Reason, Judgment, and Good Sense, Will find himself at last dismayed At smallness of his consequence. "
223,MEMORY AND REASON.,"The choicest gems must polish bear, And metals must be purged from earth, Before a lustre they can wear That tells of their intrinsic worth. The brain requires friction of thought, Obtained through contact with the world, With which may skillfully be wrought The mental gems research unfurled. "
224,MEMORY AND REASON.,"Who builds alone on Memory Will find he lacks a needed force To fire and set the spirit free, And move him onward in the course That tends to lead him by a way Whose goal is sure, complete success, But wanting such, can but display Chaotic mass of nothingness. "
225,MEMORY AND REASON.,"Let Memory and Reason wed, Their product then may fully know The food on which great minds are fed, The founts from which great actions flow; Each holds its share of honored meed, But each requires the other's aid To stimulate the urgent need By which great genius is displayed. "
227,MEMORY AND REASON.,"Many a brave resolution Is formed on New Year's Day To annihilate some vices That on our morals prey; But before the year is ended They go so far astray We find our lives are pursuing The old, accustomed way. "
229,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"I have often thought there's a power Unknown to science or art, That opens and closes the portals That lead to the human heart. "
230,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"I have learned there's a secret something That remains yet undefined, That touches the springs and pulleys That open the human mind. "
231,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"I have watched the glow of faces, As a light from this occult source Has touched some inert nature With an energizing force. "
232,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The effect was so magnetic, It seemed like creative skill From the hand of the Great Master, To give passive being _will_. "
233,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"Sometimes its power seemed but presence, Sometimes, a soft, mild tone, Sometimes, a look of decision, Ofttimes, from a source unknown. "
234,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,There's a something wrapped in th' nature Of those most adapted to teach That charms and holds the attention Of those whom its powers reach. 
235,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,There's a sound from some vibration Within the human voice That arouses the latent spirit And makes the soul rejoice. 
236,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,Its tone has a magic power Whereby the heart is impressed With the weight of its noble mission And unselfish interest. 
237,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,There's a mystic charm most winsome In th' glance of a speaking eye Whose light shines in dark recesses And explores them in passing by. 
238,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"It illumines the page of the student As his soul warms by its fire, And stirs him to greater action, And lifts aspirations higher. "
239,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"Every word and look and action Has weight on trustful youth, That needs no sage to interpret Or explain its vital truth. "
240,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"They are fully comprehended Through the instinct, every one, And need no labored searching In a massive lexicon. "
241,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"Some call this power attraction, Some term it affinity, But all recognize its existence And wonderful potency. "
242,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"There's also a power of repulsion That breathes with abated breath, Whose presence is best betokened By ominous signs of death. "
243,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"No word has an inspiration, No look has a sign of cheer, Each act reveals that a burden Must be borne in sorrow and fear. "
244,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The wrecks that are made by its presence Have filled almshouses and jails With the deepest of lamentations, The saddest of human wails. "
245,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"A selfish, terrible monster That drives away honor and truth Is the cold-blooded fiend Repulsion, The destroyer of tender youth. "
246,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The sea in its frenzy and fury, When lashed by the wintry gales Casts on the rocks its vessels Bereft of their spars and sails; "
247,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The path of the fierce tornado, Overstrewn with wild debris Of fallen habitations And uprooted forest tree; "
248,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The wreck of a world of matter That transforms revolving spheres, Which have gathered all their greatness Through the lapse of a million years; "
249,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,The snow-clad mountain terror-- The fearful avalanche-- Whose thunders are heard in valleys Where imploring faces blanch; 
250,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The mouth of a raging Etna With its stifling breath of fire, Wherein the pride of a city In a moment may expire; "
251,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The trembling of the mountains When an earthquake passes by, And the terror of the people Struck dumb in their agony; "
252,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The rage of a foaming torrent, After the bursting cloud Has poured its liquid fury In destruction wild and loud; "
253,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,Are but the potent protests Of Nature's elements Against some ill arrangement That brings them discontents. 
254,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"But these in separate actions, Or in forces all combined, Leave not so sad a ruin As the wreck of one human mind. "
255,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The voice, the eye, and the manner Are all unlocked by a key That has for its great attraction A confiding sympathy. "
256,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"The knowledge of books is essential To those who youth would guide, But the grace of earnest endeavor Excels all else beside. "
257,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"Truth in its plainness is beauty, Science itself is a charm, But the frown of a tyrant tutor Puts both in constant alarm. "
258,THE DESIRABLE UNDEFINED.,"To receive a healthful impression, Mind must be free from fear, Will must be held by attraction, Soul, by a soul sincere. "
260,MIRRORS.,"Some persons in mind are but mirrors Reflecting what others have thought, That make no original errors, They are only able to quote. You may ask their opinion on matters That pertain to affairs of the day, Their minds are but shreds and tatters Of what all their neighbors say. "
261,MIRRORS.,"We respect the man who is careful With others his mind to compare, But who of himself is not fearful His honest opinion to share With men, when some public measure Upon the State has been thrown,-- Who proves his mind a rich treasure He uses and calls his own. "
263,MANY.,"Many a grand ambition Had birth and died in a day, From lack of vigorous nursing To keep it from decay. "
264,MANY.,"Many a hope has faded And sunk in deepest despair, Through lack of careful pruning That fruitage it might bear. "
265,MANY.,"Many a mind is ruined And becomes chaotic mass, Through want of systematic Training in the class. "
266,MANY.,"Many a song of sweetness Has lost its harmony, Because at its beginning It had not the proper key. "
267,MANY.,"Many a field most fertile Bears vile and noxious weeds, Through failure of the tiller To sow some worthy seeds. "
268,MANY.,"Many a flower of beauty And sweetness blooms unseen, And dies in its seclusion On a bed of mossy green. "
269,MANY.,"Better to have no talent, No excellence to give, Than permit vice to destroy The talent we may have. "
271,MANY.,"No dam can restrain the water When leaks receive no care, When the tempest in wild fury Doth chafe and gnaw and tear, And no hand is raised to succor, No effort to repair, Till the torrent bursts in fury And fills us with despair. 'Tis too late then for repining, Too late, for work or prayer. "
273,DUTY DONE.,"A duty done is victory won, E'en though in the doing, Efforts may fail to bring avail In lines we are pursuing. "
274,DUTY DONE.,"Nothing is lost whate'er the cost, When efforts made are noble, Beyond the sky acts never die, And honor's crown is double. "
275,DUTY DONE.,"Right cannot fail, but must prevail, If noble be the motive; Heaven is nigher if we aspire With hearts sincere and votive. "
276,DUTY DONE.,Much strength we gain when we maintain A truth for truth's sake solely; A mighty power guides effort's hour And stamps its cause as holy. 
277,DUTY DONE.,"If honest heart act well its part, And ask the aid of heaven Its feeblest word will be so heard That succor will be given. "
278,DUTY DONE.,It matters not how low our lot We rise by honest trial; No effort made for needed aid E'er met complete denial. 
279,DUTY DONE.,"The soul expands when it demands A right for self and others, And darkest night has ray of light For honest helpful brothers. "
280,DUTY DONE.,A noble soul spurns the control Would bind in servile fetters; No chains can bind God-given mind Inspired by love and letters. 
281,DUTY DONE.,"An earnest will can ne'er be still Though oft its hopes be baffled, It will succeed though victims bleed And die upon the scaffold. "
282,DUTY DONE.,"Loud shout and sing, ""Crown Effort King,"" And let the watchword be This earnest prayer heard everywhere, ""God and Humanity."" "
283,DUTY DONE.,"A duty done is victory won, For strength comes by the doing; There's no retreat, there's no defeat, If right we are pursuing. "
286,THE EYE.,Some eyes are trained to scan large field Till instantaneous glance may yield A knowledge full and plenty; While others keep a narrow ken And view the ways of active men With satisfaction scanty. 
287,THE EYE.,"The optic nerve has power so keen, That ev'ry object by it seen Is stamped upon the brain; But they of sluggish mental mold No vivid photograph will hold, And scarce a scene retain. "
289,THE EAR,"The tympanum with perfect drum Hears not the sound when armies come With clarion notes and song, Unless its stimulated nerve Has fully learned to humbly serve In stations which belong "
290,THE EAR,"To those which God designed should live For special duties, He might give To move mankind along Upon the road toward perfect man, That He might thus reveal His plan, And happiness prolong. "
292,THE TONGUE.,"The power that lies in perfect speech Dwells with the few who only reach That art through toil and care; A faulty tongue perverts the ear, Destroys the sense, augments the fear, And feeds on empty air. "
293,THE TONGUE.,"A nation's destinies have hung Upon the influence of a tongue Whose magic eloquence Has swayed the thoughts of men, whose word Was mightier than the glittering sword Of armies most immense. "
295,THE HAND.,"The manual touch when guided by The magic power of sympathy That animates the soul, May lead to fields of cultured art And cast an influence on the heart May through all ages roll. "
296,THE HAND.,The canvass and the stone may speak To more than Roman and to Greek Though in a foreign land; They show the might of cultured skill Directed by an iron will That guides a master's hand. 
298,THE NOSE.,"The perfumed fields of blooming May, The evening scent of new-mown hay Touch nerve olfactory, And carry to the thoughtful brain Loved memories of a long-past train That once was full of glee. "
299,THE NOSE.,"Though flowers to-day are choice and rare, In colors they may well compare With richest hues we meet; They lack the charm that gave them power Since past is youth's entrancing hour Their fragrance seems less sweet. "
301,COMBINED INFLUENCE.,"Five roads lead to the human brain And through these roads all must obtain The commerce of all lore; No thought can enter mental port Of any kind or any sort, Of modern days or yore, "
302,COMBINED INFLUENCE.,"Except such as a tariff pays To pass these honored, great highways Which lead to eminence, And follow closely every nerve Which God designed should truly serve Each mind of consequence. "
304,COMBINED INFLUENCE.,"Perhaps that star in yonder sky, May be my dwelling place on high, When life on earth is done; At eventide I love to gaze Upon its soft reflected rays, When silent and alone. "
305,COMBINED INFLUENCE.,"Its brightness charms and draws my soul, By some mysterious, strong control I cannot well explain, Unless it be within it dwell The friends of earth I loved so well, Who could not here remain. "
307,SOUL SPEAKS TO SOUL.,"Soul speaks to soul, eye speaks to eye, And mind by mind is read; The heart bounds in sweet ecstasy Whene'er a light is shed, That shines to illume a cherished thought That seemed to dwell alone, But on through years has nobly sought To solve some truth unknown. "
308,SOUL SPEAKS TO SOUL.,"The living truth that seemeth dead, Needs but a kindred touch To resurrect thought's vital thread, And give it influence, such As breaks the bands of fettered mind, And sunders thraldom's chains, Spreads benefactions, pure, refined, Where ignorance now reigns. "
309,SOUL SPEAKS TO SOUL.,"Magnetic touch of spark divine, Speak to the inert soul, Let light from out the darkness shine, And truth her page unroll; Speak to the minds that waiting, starve, And give them power to see, That he who patiently will serve Shall win the victory. "
311,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"[Written for an entertainment given by the Fife and Drum Corps (36 uniformed members) of the Third Ward Grammar School of Long Island City, of which the writer is Principal.] "
312,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"There are fields of martial glory Where the slain are ne'er bemoaned; There are victories though silent, Where grim monarchs are dethroned; There are scenes of strife and foray Where gigantic forces strive For the mastery and triumph Of the ends for which they live. "
313,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"There are forces more puissant Than ten million armed men, There are banners that are emblems Of the mighty tongue and pen, That reflect upon their blazon Honest purpose grand and true, Such as never graced the victors Of Sedan and Waterloo. "
314,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"There are weapons in these contests Keener than the Damask blade, There are metals of such temper As no crucible e'er made; For the dross must be extracted In the furnace of the soul Till no refuse or pollution Shall defile the perfect whole. "
315,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"Though this army counts its millions, Each must face alone the foe, Each must bring a special weapon, Each must strike himself the blow That shall free him from the shackles Of that despot and his train, Who with ignorance and vices Would destroy the heart and brain. "
316,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"Our true sword is Education And grim Ignorance our foe; We are battling with our passions, And our spirits are aglow With a full determination To accept the proven truth That the days of precious seed-time, Are the sunny days of youth. "
317,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"Day by day the contest rages And each task that's daily done, Brings a soothing satisfaction That another victory's won. Thus the strength we gain in action Aids in each succeeding strife, To make the struggles lighter In the battles of our life. "
318,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"There are avenues and byways Which lead into the heart, Whose intricate environments Require the highest art To tell what inspiration Shall touch a dormant mind, And fire it with a living zeal For a station more refined. "
319,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"It is only voice of music That speaks universal tongue; It matters not in what accent A sweet melody is sung, It will find responsive feelings Which will aptly understand Though it be of unknown measure And sung in a foreign land. "
320,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"We come with our martial music, With our noisy fife and drum To inspire the weak and weary, To open the mouths of the dumb, To train our every emotion For a better sphere in life, To enjoy for the passing moment The sound of the drum and fife. "
321,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"We hope our notes may be peaceful And free from carnage of war; We would bind up the broken hearted And cover the wound and scar, But should foe our country menace And refuse to be just and calm, We would sound aloud the tocsin And march to defend Uncle Sam. "
323,OUR BATTLEFIELD.,"To plant an intellectual seed And guard its growth from noxious weed, That it may fruitage bear, Is solace more, a thousand fold, Than hoarding bonds and stocks and gold, Or sporting jewels rare. "
325,GOOD HABITS.,"A silent force marks out the course Of every man and woman, No matter what may be the lot Of creatures that are human, "
326,GOOD HABITS.,"The end attained is ever gained By means so strange and hidden, We call it luck, instead of pluck, Or fate by fairies bidden. "
327,GOOD HABITS.,"The human eye cannot descry All workings of the brain; At silent night, it gains a might Which bears a mental train "
328,GOOD HABITS.,"Whose lucid glow may thrones o'erthrow, Or bid new nations rise, May prove some plan whereby proud man May ransack earth and skies. "
329,GOOD HABITS.,"Think not such power a fairy's dower, Or influence from some star, It did not spring from anything Beyond what mortals are. "
330,GOOD HABITS.,To man is given the keys of heaven If they be rightly used; No being born but must be shorn If blessings are abused. 
331,GOOD HABITS.,"Keep well the trust! Guard it we must, From in and outward foes, Strength will be gained, might be attained By efforts to oppose "
332,GOOD HABITS.,The secret vice that doth entice To ruin and despair; But he who will hath power to kill Such vice within its lair. 
333,GOOD HABITS.,Let habits grand the life command And Eden is regained; No future bliss need surpass this If habits are unstained. 
334,GOOD HABITS.,"Let smiling face your presence grace And earth will smile on you, Let from the tongue a song be sung, Its echo will be true, "
335,GOOD HABITS.,"And sing again the same refrain Upon the selfsame key, Till airs elate, reverberate, Heaven's sweetest minstrelsy. "
336,GOOD HABITS.,"If we extend a hand to friend Who needs a brother's care, Though it may hold no purse of gold The act he will revere. "
337,GOOD HABITS.,"Scarce do we know whence comes the glow That duty done e'er gives, Its altar-fire cannot expire-- Here and hereafter lives. "
338,GOOD HABITS.,"Such habits then, for gods and men, Are but the means whereby They may prepare to gain their share To mansions in the sky. "
339,GOOD HABITS.,"Sing then a song, its notes prolong, In praise of Habit's power; Let custom be from evil free And it will blessings shower. "
341,EVIL HABITS.,"How habit grows no one e'er knows, And yet he is a giant That has a will and subtle skill That never yet was pliant. "
342,EVIL HABITS.,"'Tis very plain that he has slain More than the sword and spear, With wily art he charms the heart And quells the greatest fear. "
343,EVIL HABITS.,"His artful eye is wondrous sly And has bewitching glance, Where'er he moves his victim loves To see his powers advance. "
344,EVIL HABITS.,"He makes no noise 'mong girls and boys Whom he would call his own, His spell is cast, he holds them fast Till they are overthrown. "
345,EVIL HABITS.,"When this is done the field is won, And they are all his own, He heeds no cry, no choking sigh, No plea, no prayer, no groan. "
346,EVIL HABITS.,"If you would be forever free From tyrant so severe, Watch every thought before you're caught, For he is hovering near. "
347,EVIL HABITS.,"Your every word guard with the sword Of truth, which never fails, Its honor's sung in every tongue, Its power e'er prevails. "
348,EVIL HABITS.,"Act well your part, and keep your heart Free from the tares he sows, For at the end like traitor friend He leaves you with your woes. "
349,EVIL HABITS.,"Thus Habit mars with wounds and scars The favored of our race, Transforms the mind that God designed Should be the dwelling place "
350,EVIL HABITS.,"Of noble thought with heaven fraught Into a sterile plain, Whose atmosphere is dank and drear-- A wild chaotic brain. "
351,EVIL HABITS.,"Man scarce may be entirely free From wiles and tricks and snares, Whose stealthy forms and subtle charms Approach us unawares. "
352,EVIL HABITS.,"Our eyes are blind or not inclined To see that powerful hand, That silently, yet forcibly Gives us its strong command. "
354,LIFE'S EMERGENCIES.,"How strangely dark are the vapors That sometimes obscure the way, Ere the light of truth advances To the noon of a perfect day. "
355,LIFE'S EMERGENCIES.,"As the unforeseen approaches In stealth from ambushed retreat, The mettle of soul is summoned Its emergencies to meet. "
356,LIFE'S EMERGENCIES.,"To shrink by its sudden coming, To surrender our control Without a struggle for vantage, Betrays a weakness of soul. "
357,LIFE'S EMERGENCIES.,"The conflicts with emergencies We meet in our daily call, Give strength or death to moral worth As we conquer them or fall. "
358,LIFE'S EMERGENCIES.,"To meet at once with valor true The attack from an ambuscade, In moral strife, or bloody war, Hath many a hero made. "
359,LIFE'S EMERGENCIES.,"Who has not trained himself to meet The vicissitudes that arise Upon the course of life's stern race, Must fail to secure its prize. "
361,LIFE'S EMERGENCIES.,"To hold a pessimistic view, And see the world as darkly ""blue,"" And feel mankind is false, untrue, Is not a just conclusion; But Truth demands that Hope shall wear No false rose in her silken hair, To hide Deceit, Fraud, and Despair, That feed on wild Delusion. "
363,STRAND DESPAIR.,"The wrecks that lie on Strand Despair, Should serve as buoys on life's stern seas To guide the voyager safely, where He may escape the tides and breeze That drive to whirlpools, bars, and rocks, Where human vessels oft impinge And leave a ruin that but mocks The pleadings of persuasion's hinge. "
364,STRAND DESPAIR.,"An idle mind, companions base, A shrinking from a duty known, A sly deceit, a brazen face, A lying tongue, a sullen tone, Lead toward a wreck on Strand Despair, And none but self can move the helm To change the course for scenes more fair, To save from storms that overwhelm. "
366,INDULGENCE.,"An alarm is sounding through the land That tells of a stronger foe Than that which marched on Lexington, To strike a fatal blow At the liberties our sires did claim For themselves and all mankind, For this foe is a product of deceit And sophistry combined. "
367,INDULGENCE.,"Its victims fall by the smiling ways Of a charmed environment That lures him on to neglect and sin, And to final banishment Of the vital spark of an earnest man, And all that is noble and true, To the effete round of nothingness Which honor and strength will subdue. "
368,INDULGENCE.,"No Spartan Helen of beauty and fame, No mermaid with winsome face, No Siren that sings an alluring song, No Pandora in her grace, Can soothe and charm to destruction's retreat, Like the foe that robs of power To meet the needs of life's true aim, The requirements of each hour. "
369,INDULGENCE.,"It has filled our courts, our prisons, our jails, And filled our almshouses, too, Itself and distress walk hand in hand, No crimes but its victims will do; Though it seems like a true and trusty friend 'Tis a tyrant in disguise, It leads to distrust and uncertainty, It wins no enduring prize. "
370,INDULGENCE.,"In homes it leads to disorder wild, In school, to defiance of laws, In nations, to strife on bloody fields, In man, to destruction's jaws; In business its office is but to destroy, In friendship, brings lack of respect, In love, oft a maddened, frenzied heart That can never endure neglect. "
371,INDULGENCE.,"Parents, true kindness holds steady hand, Judges, know justice is kind, Teachers, remember the work for you Is to strengthen heart and mind. Kindness, dethroned by lack of control, Ruins our girls and our boys, Firmness is noble, honest, and true, Indulgence only destroys. "
373,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,"And so another week has gone, And I once more am left alone Within my silent room; My mind is worn by fervent care, And, languishing, it needs repair For duties yet to come. "
374,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,"From all the cares which come on me I cannot be entirely free Thro' all this mortal life; But cares imported from abroad Make much more ponderous the load, And cause more bitter strife. "
375,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,"With patient labor, day by day, I work along this toilsome way Intent on doing good; My pupils' hearts I would inspire With noble thoughts and strong desire For intellectual food. "
376,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,"I note the various schemes and arts, As prompted by the different hearts, They lead to different deeds. As deeds and hearts will correspond, By observation it is found There should be different meeds. "
377,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,"The wish made known for some will do, And some a gentle frown would rue And feel extremely sad; While others need a sterner look, A reprimand, or sharp rebuke, And sometimes e'en the rod. "
378,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,"Most gladly would I hail the day When children cheerfully obey, (If e'er that day shall come,) But ere that happy day I see, A reformation there must be In government at home. "
379,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,And what is my reward for all This watchful care and earnest toil To train the youthful mind? From Ignorance it draws a curse-- Though pocket hold a puny purse-- Yet one reward I find-- 
380,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,"To see the young prepared for life And launched upon the outward strife Of its tempestuous sea, And know that I have trained that mind, With noble thought that heart refined, Is rich reward for me. "
381,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,"When all life's lessons have been taught, And my own soul with love is fraught For earnest, striving man, Perhaps an understanding Lord Will proffer as a great reward, Redemption through His plan. "
383,THE TEACHER'S SOLILOQUY.,"A beautiful vision I sometimes see, That stands in the distance and smiles upon me; It points with a finger of radiance bright, To the fleeting shades of departing night. I would gladly know if this scene designed To be a true type of the human mind, When the mists and clouds of dark ignorance, Shall into the realms of the unknown advance. "
385,SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.,"The survival of the fittest, The advancement of the best, The enthronement of the truest In the world's great crucial test, Is emblazoned on each banner Wherever man is found, And e'en 'mong plants and animals This holds, the world around. "
386,SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.,"Then prepare for the survival, Allow no base retreat, (Dethronement means delinquency,) Endure the cold and heat; The elements that meet us May all be overcome, With God and right ever in sight, The victory may be won. "
388,THE DIFFERENCE.,"I have scanned the roll of teachers, Have noted the Aarons and Hurs Who have stayed education's Moses, And removed the cumbrous bars That environed its anxious spirit, And bowed down its life with cares. "
389,THE DIFFERENCE.,"I have counted them all over, Have analyzed heart and brain, Have watched them in daily labor That I might some key obtain To unlock the magical power, By which some supremely reign. "
390,THE DIFFERENCE.,"I have listened with ear enraptured, Have caught the gleam of the eye, Have felt the glow of emotion When bright corruscations fly From mental touch and fervor, That prompted others to try. "
391,THE DIFFERENCE.,"The soul knows no fire so warming, No light so fervent and true, As the glow of the living presence Of one of the noble few Who counts her pain but pleasure, If good she may only do. "
392,THE DIFFERENCE.,"A teacher who knows her subjects And has much of didactic art, Will present the truths of science To the youthful mind and heart, In ways so apt and skillful They will never more depart, "
393,THE DIFFERENCE.,"But will gather strength and beauty With every day and hour, Until they become a fortress-- An irresistible power To dispel the gloom of doubting That oft o'er the mind may lower. "
394,THE DIFFERENCE.,"No truth is learned by mere telling, The mind must conceive and apply; There is inspiration, knowledge, In one's own discovery That lead to efforts and struggles For a greater mastery. "
395,THE DIFFERENCE.,"Herein lies the power of teaching: A systemized method to do That reaches the understanding, And leads on to fields anew, Where _Thought_ shall be the head master, And Truth shall Error subdue; "
396,THE DIFFERENCE.,"A heart that is wholly given To leading the youthful mind, To discover the powers and virtues They within themselves shall find, And mould them into actions Progressive, strong, refined; "
397,THE DIFFERENCE.,"A spirit that sees in the being A gift from God unto man, That must live on thro' all ages, Though influenced by some plan That here has been determined, But God shall hereafter scan; "
398,THE DIFFERENCE.,"A tongue that is but the voicing Of a heart aflame with its cause, That speaks of science and morals From a knowledge of their laws; That speeds the true and worthy, But bids all deception pause; "
399,THE DIFFERENCE.,"A judgment so wisely balanced As to know what must be done To avoid the indiscretions Into which so many run, Of telling, instead of leading, Till the victory has been won. "
401,THE DIFFERENCE.,"In reckoning the moral stock Of any man or woman, It is but right to recollect That all of us are human; If heart be true, the body frail, And honestly he's striven, Tho' oft a brother's plans may fail, He ought to be forgiven. "
403,MIND AWAKENED.,"The battle is not to the mighty, Nor the race to the fleet of foot, The peak is not reached by bounding, Nor the goal by a devious route; The problems of science and culture Have been ages upon the way; The greatest vict'ries 'mong nations Have not been won in a day. 'Tis the steady tramping onward Of feet that will not turn aside From the path they are pursuing, That wins at the eventide. 'Tis the firm determination Of a strong and unyielding will, Moved on by gigantic action Of forces that cannot be still, That has won the greatest honors 'Mong nations whose moral power Have lighted liberty's beacon In despondency's darkest hour. The mind that is sometimes darkest When it struggles for light and power, Breaks off the bands of thraldom And itself like some strong tower, Becomes the bulwark of nations In defense of some sacred cause That looks toward the world's advancement, Through reign of beneficent laws. "
405,THE OGRE.,"There's an ogre abroad, boys, There's an ogre abroad, A three-handed monster That makes his abode In hamlet and city, In country and town, And revels in death As he drags people down. He's a sly old destroyer, Very loth to admit That the snares he is using Are fraud and deceit. He has slain and devoured More than the sword; By all earnest people He is greatly abhorred, For he leads to disease, To sorrow and death, As poison exhales From his presence and breath. He fastens himself On bright, innocent youth, And slyly allures him From virtue and truth. He holds by the throat The servants who wait To hear his excuses; And sad is their fate, For insidious smile Is his only excuse To victims who suffer Defeat and abuse. So sly are his movements, So stealthy his tread, Like a vampire, on blood He is frequently fed, While his victim, unconscious, Makes no defence; He steals mind and honor And good common sense. If you meet him, my boy, Beware of his grasp, For his smiles are so sweet; But on you he will clasp The shackles he carries Forever concealed, And when he secures you He seldom will yield. He will keep you away From duty and right, Destroy all your honor, Your hopes sadly blight, With promises made Which he cannot fulfill He robs of contentment And shackles the will. This monster has always A right hand and left hand That have powers of their own That ought to command. If he had only these And used them aright, His presence would ever Afford us delight; But the third hand he has Is a very unkind hand, For this ogre's real name Is Little Behind Hand. Little Behind Hand Is tyrant indeed, From which we would have Mankind ever freed. Little Behind Hand Can seldom find work, For he stumbles in blindness And gropes in the dark, He is sullen and mean, Near-sighted and sour, Ruin and trouble 'Bout him constantly lower. Drive him off! Drive him off! Ere he fasten on you His fangs of destruction, The pestilent dew That he breathes on his victim To deaden the sense Of his presence and power, And their sad consequence. Strike him down! Strike him down! With strong, sturdy blow, If you yield to him now He will soon lay you low, And when hand and foot Are at his command, You will feel he has grown To a Big Behind Hand. "
407,THE OGRE.,"The public tide is polluted With offal, fraud, and deceit; In ev'ry line of industry Its venomous forms we meet In men who sneer at truth and right, Who, Honor's path have decried, That they might gain the golden calf Whose power they have deified. "
409,MY CHOICE.,"I would rather dwell a hermit In some silent peaceful wood, Where no voice of human being Ever breaks the solitude; Where babbling brook, and minstrelsy Of winged friends are heard To join the sylvan choruses Of leaves when gently stirred, Than live in costly splendor With a heartless, greedy throng, Whose only thought is sordid pelf Obtained by fraud and wrong. "
410,MY CHOICE.,"I would far prefer a cavern On some rocky sea-girt isle, Where the constant intonations Of the waves as they recoil With their soughing and deep moaning For a momentary rest, Tell of liquid matter only That bespeaks itself distressed, Than to live where human bodies Bend and writhe for freedom's air, Till the heart breaks in deep sorrow, And the soul sinks in despair. "
411,MY CHOICE.,"I would choose a lone oasis With one tree, one flower, one spring, One bird of sprightly plumage With throat attuned to sing; One whisper of approval From a voiceless power within; One perfect intuition Of freedom from all sin, Than dwell 'mid throngs and plenty And grovel in the filth That oft adheres to those who claim The boundless stores of wealth. "
412,MY CHOICE.,"Some quiet nook in a valley With a canopy of leaves, Such as a forest Titan In fantastic beauty weaves; Or some vine-embowered tangle O'ershadowing murmuring stream Where scarce a ray of sunlight May on its waters gleam, Is a dwelling-place more restful To a man by right controlled Than the courts of kings and princes Ablaze with filched gold. "
413,MY CHOICE.,"I would not shun the haunts of men Or bustle of the world, Nor would I see progression's flag Lie dormant or unfurled; If man for manhood would aspire, And less for gold and power, If noble thoughts and noble deeds Employ each passing hour, Then should the bustle be supreme, For manhood thus would rise Above the baser things of earth To honors in the skies. "
414,MY CHOICE.,"I am not a misanthropist, Nor hater of just wealth, I love the presence of mankind, I love good-natured health, I love a true and noble soul In woman or in man, I love a being who would not Invert God's primal plan And keep in bondage soul and mind, Through base and false desire To trample fellow beings down, That he may rise still higher. "
415,MY CHOICE.,"I know that hate deep in my soul Burns with an intense flame Toward him who scourges the oppressed, And unjust power doth claim, That he may gain some subtle coign By which to overthrow The balance Justice ever holds Alike for friend or foe; For such can never bless mankind By thought or word or deed; They laugh in glee whene'er they see Their victim writhe and bleed. "
416,MY CHOICE.,"When all we teach in man is mind, And heart has no domain, Then fraud, deceit, and treachery Will form a tyrant train, For beacon light can never come Through those who legislate Unless good seed has been well sown By those who educate; But lift the soul by Sinai's laws And by the Golden Rule, Then legislation will have power Through truths taught in the school. "
418,MY CHOICE.,"The world is wanting honest men Who know and dare to do aright, Whose honor brightens in the ken Of Justice's ever-searching light. "
420,THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HOUR.,"It is hard to tell at the dawn of day What the sunset shades may bring, The plans we make may be astray, And our treasured hopes take wing. "
421,THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HOUR.,"We know not what strange environment May dwarf our most cherished plan, Or what obstructions may be sent To defeat our ends and aim. "
422,THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HOUR.,"Though we scorn the thought that fickle Fate Has Destiny in her hand, We all pay tribute at her gate And bow low at her command. "
423,THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HOUR.,"In spite of all the powers we boast Of independent action, An intervening hand may cost Our progress great detraction. "
424,THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE HOUR.,"Few, few there be who lack the power To shape their own destiny, If each will improve th' passing hour To its full capacity. "
426,A BOY.,"A boy is a wonderfully curious thing, Of all creation he deems himself King, Yet give him for pastime a top and a string And he is instantly spinning; When fishes are ripe he tries them with hook, He thinks more of them than of a new book, And steals enough time to after them look, Not conscious that he is sinning. "
427,A BOY.,"The great possibilities within his scope Prompts to exertion, inspires him with hope, Till with the world he is ready to cope For the greatest laurels of honor; Glory and fame are attractive stars He may seek in strife, under bloody Mars, Till Wisdom revolts at the ugly scars Ambition has placed upon her. "
428,A BOY.,"Oh, active, mercurial, wonderful boy, The world is a top and you spin it with joy, Regardless of all the wiles you employ To gain the pleasure of seeing; No tree is so tall, but you reach its top limb, No water so deep, but in it you swim, No ice is so smooth, but o'er it you skim Like a phantom, a wonderful being. "
431,THE TREE OF STATE.,"[The Maple was chosen by vote of the children in the schools of N. Y. State as the State Tree, and the Rose as the State Flower. Nature's Tribute, The Rose, and The Golden Rod were written at the request of the State Department of Public Instruction of N. Y. and sent to the schools of the State for Arbor Day use. Nature's Tribute was set to music.] "
432,THE TREE OF STATE.,"Tree of our state and emblem of neatness, Beauty and grace abide in thy form; Not in thy blood alone courses a sweetness, Thy ev'ry unfolding is suavity born. "
433,THE TREE OF STATE.,"Down in the vale where cowslips are growing, Where violets breathe thro' sweet scented lips, Where brook o'er the bright pebbly bottom is flowing, And bee of the nectar of columbine sips. "
434,THE TREE OF STATE.,"A monarch it stands of regnative power, In a graceful symmetrical pose; Whose arms weave a fairy, majestical bower Where wood-nymphs their beauty disclose. "
435,THE TREE OF STATE.,"Its beautiful leaf of silvery sheen, And the grandeur it gives to the grove, Proclaim to th' world it of forest is queen, And most worthy our heart's purest love. "
436,THE TREE OF STATE.,"Honor we maple as type of all neatness, Yielding protection, beauty, and grace; None of its rivals boast of such sweetness, None can in typical form fill its place. "
437,THE TREE OF STATE.,"May th' state be as pure in motive and plan, As the maple from evil is free. May every son of the state, as a man Take his type from the pure maple tree. "
438,THE TREE OF STATE.,"Then hale be the state, and hail to the tree! And each halo of glory shall last Till from all tumult our state will be free, And no stain on her honor be cast. "
439,THE TREE OF STATE.,"This tree be our care, our state's honored prize. May virtue and glory assemble, And bid every man in dignity rise Till the tree of our state he resemble. "
441,ARBOR DAY TRIBUTE.,With lavish hand our God hath spread Beauty and fragrance o'er the land; His smile revives the seeming dead; Nature awakes at His command. 
442,ARBOR DAY TRIBUTE.,"He breathes upon the leafless tree; He whispers to the tiny flower. His touch awakes the slumbering bee, And each obeys th' Almighty power. "
443,ARBOR DAY TRIBUTE.,"The perfumed breeze of smiling May, The dancing stream on mountain side, The wild bird's trill of joyous lay Proclaim Thy goodness far and wide. "
444,ARBOR DAY TRIBUTE.,"Attune our hearts to sing Thy praise, Expand our souls to comprehend Thy attributes and all Thy ways, And ever be our Guide and Friend. "
445,ARBOR DAY TRIBUTE.,"We plant to-day within the mould, The stock that needs Thy tender care; Send deep its roots, its buds unfold In answer to our faith and prayer. "
447,THE ROSE.,"When dewy morn of balmy June Awakes and blushes in the East, When song birds pipe their sweetest tune And Nature spreads her grandest feast, Among the rare and fragrant plants Whose petals most of heaven disclose, In foremost rank--far in advance-- There stands the sprightly, smiling rose. "
448,THE ROSE.,"Its home is on the wide, wide plains, In valleys where wild torrents foam, In solitudes where silence reigns, And by the cotter's humble home. It cheers alike the rich and poor On Alpine heights, or by the sea, By castle wall or peasant's door-- It justly claims ubiquity. "
449,THE ROSE.,"Could blushing beauty born of heaven, Or world-wide worship win the prize, Could fragrance, fancy, fame, or even The rich rays of reflected skies Soothe sorrows sharp and scorching sting And give the world complete repose, Then men should shout and children sing-- ""The flower of State must be the Rose!"" "
451,THE GOLDENROD.,"When August sunset's yellow blaze Streams out o'er meadow, field and lawn, It seeks some shrine wherein its rays May linger till returning dawn, And touching gently with its sheen That graceful plumage of the sod, Its constellated gems of green Are changed to glorious _Goldenrod_. "
452,THE GOLDENROD.,"Its home is in the sterile soil Deserted by the rustic swain Because it yields not for his toil The recompense he would obtain. By wall and ledge, and rock, and mound, Where'er neglect and ruin reign In greatest beauty there 'tis found, To cheer and clothe the earth again. "
453,THE GOLDENROD.,"Down in the soul there dwells a thought That finds expression not in word, That counts display and promise naught Unless a voice divine is heard, That speaks to cheer the desolate, That yields a balm distilled from God; Whose type should be the flower of State-- The sun-lit, heaven-born _Goldenrod_. "
455,BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES.,"Buttercups and daisies,-- Bright children of the lawn-- To the fields are nodding In the winds of June. Such beauty of the meadows Gives a charm so sweet, so strong, The robin's spirit bursts aloud In animated song. "
456,BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES.,"Buttercups and daisies Bloom adown the narrow lane, Beside the brook in pasture, And over the wide plain; Tangles in the meadow Where ten million flowers bloom, Draw bee and bird and squirrel, With their beauty and perfume. "
457,BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES.,"Buttercups and daisies Aglow in morning light, And pendant dew-drops sparkling-- Bright diamonds of night-- Send a matin greeting To the rising god of day, As he warms them gently With his golden ray. "
458,BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES.,"Buttercups and daisies Are jewels to be worn By all sons and daughters Of Nature, truly born; They speak a perfect language, They lead to the divine, They cheer the weak and weary They strengthen and refine. "
459,BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES.,"Buttercups and daisies May softly o'er me bloom, When I am sweetly sleeping Within my restful tomb, And when by mortal beings I may forgotten be, The buttercups and daisies Shall be dear friends to me. "
461,BUTTERCUPS AND DAISIES.,"Modest, meek anemone, Loved wind-flower of the spring, You fill our hearts with gladness, For with your smile you bring The vitalizing sunshine, The fruitful April shower, The pipe of feathered songster, And bud of sylvan bower. "
463,THE FRINGED GENTIAN.,"I remember well, in my boyhood's romp, The beautiful flower that grew near the swamp, With its spiral screw Of cerulean hue, While on the marge of its petals grew A fringe, such as art never weaves. "
464,THE FRINGED GENTIAN.,"I plucked it with zeal, for my heart was aglow, Its color and form, my mother to show, And gladden her eyes With the exquisite prize I had found when autumnal zephyr sighs 'Mong the faded flowers and leaves. "

474,THE FLOWERS I LOVE.,"I sometimes think I love the rose More than all other flowers, Because its fragrance falls on me In copious, dainty showers; And blushing in its modesty, I press it to my heart, As the idol of my dalliance That should no more depart. "
475,THE FLOWERS I LOVE.,"But when I see the lily fair-- The meadow's beauteous queen-- Surrounded by her myriad friends All dressed in Nature's green, My heart goes out in ecstasy, And naught on earth to me Seems fairer type of loveliness, Than this daughter of th' lea. "
476,THE FLOWERS I LOVE.,"When bright snow-flake-petaled daisy, Whose heart of yellow gold, Is richer vein of pure delight Than miner-kings may hold, Sends out her invitation warm, To search in her domain For berries like a bleeding heart, I cannot well decline. "
477,THE FLOWERS I LOVE.,"And then the graceful goldenrod With flaunting, sun-lit plume, Whose lateness lends a special joy And sweetness to its bloom, Invites me with its wind-blown nod, To be its devotee, With honesty I must confess It has a charm for me. "
478,THE FLOWERS I LOVE.,"There's a heaven-born flower--the aster, That drinks nocturnal dews From late autumn's chilly fountains, And steals the sunset hues; It smiles from wayside tangles And coyly casts its eyes, Yet holds me by its modesty A voluntary prize. "
479,THE FLOWERS I LOVE.,"I know not which I love the most,-- I know I love them all,-- For God hath given each its grace, And each its special call; Each has a mission to perform, A purpose and an end, And sweet is the companionship Of each bright flower-friend. "

489,THE MORNING GLORY.,"The sunshine seems much brighter, And the heart is ever lighter, When the rays of sweet Aurora Gild the radiant morning glory With a splendor, such as heaven To few favorites has given Among the beautiful rare flowers. So plant these seeds with care, In a place well-chosen, where The first rays of the morning May kiss their bright adorning, And teach your heart to see The beauties there may be In the early morning hours. "
491,RYE.,"When pollen-dust from fields of rye Floats out on the dews of even, And stars of June bedeck the sky Of mild and cloudless heaven, 'Tis ecstasy to linger near The odor-laden quivers, Whose lance-like arrows then appear To be our pleasure-givers. "
492,RYE.,"When Luna bright is wreathed in smiles, And breathes upon the flowers, A billowy greenness oft beguiles Our minds by magic powers; For like the waves of ocean grand When tempest winds are high, With speed sweep by the waves on land, In the fields of liquid rye. "
493,RYE.,"Fragrant fields of beautiful June, Whose billowy, graceful green Is a mem'ry-gem that fades too soon From childhood's romantic scene, Sweet were my hours of ecstasy When by your side I was nigh; Joys I covet, long lost to me That came from sweet fields of rye. "
495,COMMUNION WITH NATURE.,"'Tis sweet to hold communion With Nature true and wild, And feel the thrill of gladness She breathes upon her child, When close upon her bosom We press the listening ear, And fancy that the minstrelsy Our raptured senses hear, Is sweeter than the chorus By angel choirs sung, Or richer than vibrations Of chords so deftly strung, That all their intonations Seem blended in one strain, By touch of fairy fingers Which enchant the sweet refrain. "
496,COMMUNION WITH NATURE.,"The beauties of the sunset Upon the evening sky, When flecked with fleeting vapors, Detached and awry, Give colors that no artist Save God alone can show To eyes that seek such blendings, And hearts that long to know The hidden things in Nature Which ne'er can be revealed To those who find not heaven In mountain, sky, and field; For they who live the nearest To Nature's self shall find Joy boundless as the ocean, As pure and unconfined. "
497,COMMUNION WITH NATURE.,"Deep in the leafy forest A thousand tones are heard,-- The laughing, dancing brooklet, The song of bright-winged bird, The buzz of bee on flower, The leaf by breezes fanned, The hum of tiny insect Whose feeble notes command The modulated heart-beat To know the great decree, That frees the mind from slavery And sets the spirit free, Through knowledge of those hidden things Which God only reveals To him who loves all nature, And for a brother feels. "
498,COMMUNION WITH NATURE.,"The dearest and the sweetest Of all the charms on earth, Are those that link our natures To feelings that have birth When leaf and flower and fruitage Steal our being for an hour, And we are half unconscious Of some mysterious power, That leads us close to heaven, And points to joys supreme, Where fields and flowers and happiness Are not an idle dream, But a true and soothing heritage Whose limit has no end, Where ev'ry rock and tree and shrub Shall prove a trusted friend. "
499,COMMUNION WITH NATURE.,"If heaven is not shadowed Upon our spirit mind, Through all its gorgeous tintings And colorings combined; If Nature has no language To charm the ear and eye, And brooks and birds and forests Afford no minstrelsy; If waving grain and orchards, Freighted with fragrance rare, Draw not the spirit heavenward And lift the soul in prayer; Then orisons are soulless Though voiced on bended knee, And small must be our knowledge Of the Great Deity. "

516,THE STREAM'S STORY.,"I sat me down in a forest old, Beside a low murmuring stream; I lent my ear to the tale it told, For 'twas more than fancy's dream; "
517,THE STREAM'S STORY.,"It spoke of days when the earth was young, When it flowed more cheerfully, When its water sang the rocks among, As they danced down toward the sea. "
518,THE STREAM'S STORY.,"""In the ancient days my banks were filled, Nor shrank I from heat or frost, For the shaded, moss-crowned earth then held The drops, so that none were lost. "
519,THE STREAM'S STORY.,"""The old forest then stretched far away, And its sheltering arms embraced Sweet perfumed plants and flowerets gay, Whose lives long ago have ceased. "
520,THE STREAM'S STORY.,"""For the sturdy woodman plied the blade And the forest soon lay low; Then the burning sun and the want of shade Soon shrank my full crystal flow. "
521,THE STREAM'S STORY.,"""Now when the rain comes, my waters roar, And my spoils are sad to see, For the earth-vaults where I kept my store, Hold no surplus now for me. "

523,THE STREAM'S STORY.,"""Who come with their songs in merry May, O'er valley, hill, and plain, To plant young trees on this Arbor Day, So in joy I smile again."" "
525,THE STREAM'S STORY.,"To wander all day, by a purling stream That flows through some mossy dell, And watch its silvery waters gleam, And list to its music's swell As it dashes down some wild cascade, On its race to the wide, wide sea, With sweeter strains than old Orpheus played, Is supreme delight to me. "
527,THE SECOND SUNDAY IN MAY.,"Softly the breezes dance o'er the meadows, Wafting the perfume of sweet-scented May; Flecked are the green fields with sunshine and shadows, Telling so gently of earth's perfect day. "
528,THE SECOND SUNDAY IN MAY.,"From moss-covered rocks whereon we are seated, Nature spreads scenes such as art cannot yield; With flowers of rare beauty our vision is greeted, Our ears, with the bird-notes of forest and field. "
529,THE SECOND SUNDAY IN MAY.,"Dogwood with tints from pink to pure whiteness, Columbine crimson with pinnacled sheen, Pinks of carnation, and orchards in brightness, Vie with the meadows of velvety green. "
530,THE SECOND SUNDAY IN MAY.,"The bobolink chatters in notes of perfection, The oriole sings a love-song to his mate, The whippoorwill clings to his perch for protection, The crow laughs ha! ha! when the evening grows late. "

532,THE SECOND SUNDAY IN MAY.,"The song of the bird-note, the hum of the bee, The tinkling of waters, the bursting of leaves, The perfume of flowers, the blossoming tree, Are sermons from Nature the pulpit ne'er gives. "
533,THE SECOND SUNDAY IN MAY.,"My soul sings with these, with these has communion, They lift me in thought to realms pure and bright; They speak of a Nature with which to have union Dispels all my sorrows and gives me delight. "
534,THE SECOND SUNDAY IN MAY.,"Every sigh of the breeze, every note of wild bird, Every plant that springs up from earth's fertile sod, Are sermons of eloquence when rightly heard, That soothe me and bring me nearer to God. "
536,NATURE'S CHILD.,"I would rather dwell with Nature And be her favored child, To love plant, tree, and creature That live in forest wild; And feel the satisfaction That I can understand The beauty and attraction Of motives, noble, grand, That fashioned for man's pleasure This brilliant world of ours, Than possess the jeweled treasure Of all earth's kingly powers. "

548,"LAKE GEORGE, N. Y.","Who loves devoutly Nature wild, And sees in her a Master's hand, Will seldom be a wayward child Though foul temptations round him stand. Magnetic forces draw him back From following low and slavish ways, His soul revolts at the attack That foe of Nature--Vice, displays. "
550,THE THRUSH.,"When on mountain road I travel, Stained with dust and dirt and gravel, In cool shade I sit me down; Oft I see among the bushes Feathered friends--shy brown thrushes, Sweetest singers of renown. "
551,THE THRUSH.,"Smooth his coat though brown and dusty, His mellow voice is ever trusty And clear and soft and sweet; On the tree-top oft he's singing, In the woods his voice is ringing While hills his notes repeat. "
552,THE THRUSH.,"I have heard him in the morning When the sun was just adorning Tops of tallest forest trees, Pour his soul of song so tender, That to God he seemed to render Thanksgiving harmonies. "
553,THE THRUSH.,"Every feather he did quiver, As his song he would deliver In bursts so wild and grand, That creation's face would gladden As the air with music laden Seemed fraught with choral band. "
554,THE THRUSH.,"Some notes that swelled his speckled breast Were like soft zephyrs from the west That fall on June-blown flowers; So full, so sweet, they lull the soul, And like a spirit voice control My reveries for hours. "
555,THE THRUSH.,"Soulful song, enwrapped in feather, Harbinger of pleasant weather, Sing softly unto me. Your tuneful notes at morn and even Are antepasts of joys in heaven That bring felicity. "

557,THE THRUSH.,"Sweet warbling bird in brown attire, Your notes of praise do me inspire With love for Nature wild; Your songs of joy so sweetly sung, By heart and throat divinely strung, Proclaim you Nature's child. "
559,ROBIN REDBREAST.,"Low and soft and plaintive, Now distant and now near, Is the voice of Robin Redbreast, That in the tree I hear. "
560,ROBIN REDBREAST.,"Sometimes 'tis but a murmur, So gentle and so sweet, It sounds like a dying zephyr That echo doth repeat. "
561,ROBIN REDBREAST.,"And then in bursts of music That make the forests ring, Comes the swelling, happy ditty His birdship loves to sing. "
562,ROBIN REDBREAST.,"And the voice is so enchanting, So perfect and so clear, All earth stands still to listen, And the clouds bend low to hear. "
563,ROBIN REDBREAST.,"Again he tunes his liquid note To winds in tree-tops sighing, Or to the sound of waters That o'er the rocks are playing. "
564,ROBIN REDBREAST.,"The sprightly, sweet ventriloquist Deceives you as to distance, You sometimes think him far away Beyond alarm's resistance, "

570,THE FARMER.,"Of war and love some poets sing, And some of fame and glory, But few there are a tribute bring To him whose only story Is written on the sterile soil With hand of honest labor, Whose plow and hoe bespeak a toil More grand than gory sabre. "
571,THE FARMER.,"My muse will sing of such as these, And claim a wreath of laurel, To crown each sturdy Hercules Whose only wish to quarrel, Is with the forest and the field To make them rich and fairer, To make old mother earth to yield Her fruits and flowers e'en rarer. "

573,THE FARMER.,"The lily-fingered, pale-faced men Who live by ""A Profession,"" Need not despise the farmer, when He makes some slight digression Upon what they call etiquette; For in his heart he's civil; Though rough his hand, his brow asweat, His heart is free from evil. "
574,THE FARMER.,"He toils from early morn till night, Yet he is ""Independent;"" For Nature's God defends the right, And holds a crown resplendent To place upon His honored child Whose life is heavy laden, But keeps a spirit undefiled To enter into Eden. "

589,"OCEANUS' MIRROR, TRINITY LAKE, N. Y.","I've been charmed by many a picture, That has brought its master renown; I have looked on beautiful valleys From the mountain's lofty crown; I have gazed on the sky at evening, When the heavens were all aglow, But they fail to charm me so fully As this scene in the waters below. "
590,"OCEANUS' MIRROR, TRINITY LAKE, N. Y.","Fair Trinity lay in her beauty, Not a ripple was on her breast, Her borders of hemlocks and mosses With beautiful flowers were dressed; Clear as the air on her bosom Were her waters so pure and deep, They seemed like the magical mirror That Flora and Nereus keep. "
591,"OCEANUS' MIRROR, TRINITY LAKE, N. Y.","Where the rocks and trees bend over The marge of her western shore, The boat glided slowly onward Without the aid of the oar; When glancing the eye at the shadows Reflected from shore near at hand, There appeared a bright panorama, Most charming--exquisitely grand. "
592,"OCEANUS' MIRROR, TRINITY LAKE, N. Y.","Down, down, far down in the waters, And touching the brink of the lake, Was a picture no master painter With pencil or brush could make; Gray rocks, green trees, and bright flowers, Inverted and magnified, too, Seemed perfect in all but proportion And their upturned chimerical view. "
593,"OCEANUS' MIRROR, TRINITY LAKE, N. Y.","It seemed like a fairy enchantment Inviting to feasts down below, Where grottoes and caverns of beauty Illumine the flowers that grow To charm the nymphs of the water, And beguile all the sylvan elves To the table of old Oceanus, Where guests ever help themselves. "
594,"OCEANUS' MIRROR, TRINITY LAKE, N. Y.","Some spirit seemed calling me sweetly, Inviting me then to partake Of the fanciful pleasures reflected Far down in the clear, placid lake. O, beautiful scene of reflection! So perfect, so grand, and so pure, In my mind that mirror enchantment To the end of my days must endure. "

600,MORNING FLOWERS.,"That spring unfolds to pleasure's eye; There's wisdom in the falling drop That had its birth in yonder sky. The breeze that fans the fevered brow, Or gives new vigor to frail man, Is but the breath of the Divine Sent to fulfill benignant plan. "
602,ARTIST NATURE.,"When Aurora springs from her couch of clouds And opens the gate of a perfect day, And her brother Sol in his daily rounds Advances his steeds toward Polaris' ray, Then the vernal bloom and the warbling bird That follow his track as he speeds along, Send their fragrance pure on the morning air, And fill leafy groves with ecstatic song. "
603,ARTIST NATURE.,"Oceanus lends invisible bowls, Well filled with vapors that rise from his breast, Eurus is summoned to waft them afar And scatter abroad in the distant west, Where Sol with his brush and an artist's touch, Paints on the sky all the glories of heaven, In colors more bright and blendings more true, Than ever on canvas by mortal was given. "
604,ARTIST NATURE.,"One sunset scene in Hesperian sky, When the courts of heaven are all ablaze With the glorious tints and pageantry That to mortal mind so clearly portrays The mighty power of omnipotent hand, And the tender touch of a boundless love, Is an omen true--infallible proof Of a Deity who presides above. "
607,MUSIC.,"When musical chords are tensioned To sentiments they should express, And touched by a master artist Whose deft hand gives the proper stress, The effect is so ecstatic When vibrations fall on the ear, The soul stands in silent rapture, And our being expands to hear. "
608,MUSIC.,"At skillful touch of the master A creation of joy is given, That lends to the spirit pinions To waft it away toward heaven, While it sings to the same measure And becomes a part of the song, Enraptured by the magic power Which carries it gently along. "
609,MUSIC.,"O the magic power of tension When a master hand has control! It wins the heart's approbation And augments the receptive soul; 'Tis a rapture born in heaven To entrance our expectant ears, 'Tis angelic diapason Such as harmonized once the spheres. "
610,MUSIC.,"We each have an organ, tensioned With a thousand strings and their keys, All made by a Master builder Who permits us ourselves to please; Its wonderful combinations Far surpass all the works of art, 'Tis the master-piece of creation-- The versatile, strange, human heart. "
611,MUSIC.,"We have sole choice of the music That shall sound on the tensioned strings; We may choose if sad or joyous Shall be the final note it sings; Though fate may fling fiercest chaos, Its Maker reserved to us powers That we need not ever surrender, For the strength to possess is ours. "
612,MUSIC.,"Let my tongue sing songs of rapture And my heart-strings sweetly respond, Till the notes shall pass earth's border And reach the bright portals beyond; And when in the great hereafter The tension shall be much increased, My joys will be there augmented To know that earth's songs have not ceased. "
614,MUSIC.,"I often long for some quiet nook Away from the noise and strife Which come from the steady daily round That absorbs my busy life; Away in some shadowy forest Whose silence is supreme, Save the song of feathered minstrel And the murmur of a stream; Far away among the dark shadows That form Fauna's trysting-bowers,-- But the time of this total seclusion Should ne'er exceed six hours. "
616,REST.,"When wearisome task is finished And flesh with fatigue is oppressed, When muscles are tired and languid And sinews are sorely distressed, No balm can renew their vigor Like that boon from heaven called rest. "
617,REST.,"We know not its composition, Nor can we expound all its laws, We grant the effect is pleasant Tho' we cannot explain the cause; We therefore accept the blessing And bid curiosity pause. "
618,REST.,"Foremost in its rank of agents Is a heavenly maid called Sleep, Who stands in unbroken silence, And ever her watch will keep O'er mortals whose labors and trials Seem heavy, oppressive, and deep. "
619,REST.,"Sometimes when sorrows are deepest This maiden refuses relief; She's no balm for the broken-hearted, No cure for a head bowed with grief, No soothing touch for the anguish That robs like a heartless thief. "
620,REST.,"She flies from deep woe and sorrow And recedes from the blinding tear; Yet hastes to fatigue and trials And offers to them smiles of cheer Such as turn to joy and gladness, Murky doubt and foreboding fear. "
621,REST.,"When death shall release the spirit From its prison-house of vile clay, It will speed to an elysian Of a cloudless, unending day, Where with others of its kindred, It will find a rest for aye. "
623,REST.,"Well filled with murky ink, When in my solitary den I sit for hours to think, And trace my thoughts in liquid flow Upon some virgin page, That in the future it may show What thoughts my mind engage. "
625,SUCCESS.,"Success knows no diminution, For failure hovers so near, That with trace of slight dilution, Success must cease to appear. "
626,SUCCESS.,"We look in vain for a substitute To take the place of success; A proxy saps its vital cords, It dies of paralysis. "
627,SUCCESS.,"Nothing can take the place of success, Its measure must be complete, If slightest imperfection is found It suffers a deadly defeat. "
628,SUCCESS.,"The marge that divides sturdy success From failure grim and gaunt, Is invisible space, but separates Abundance from woe and want. "
629,SUCCESS.,"Like pack of wolves on army's trail, Fell failure lives on distress, Devouring with greed th' foul refuse That falls from th' hands of success. "
630,SUCCESS.,"Success and failure closely abide-- Success has a palace fine, While failure dwells in a dreary hut, Like a herding place for swine. "
631,SUCCESS.,"Success may not always achieve The object it has in view, But lives while its motives and acts Are earnest, noble, and true. "
632,SUCCESS.,"True failure can only be found In a being devoid of heart, Whose efforts and deeds are all dead, Or act but a sluggard's part. "
633,SUCCESS.,"Success has a heart that can sing, A hand and a spirit to try, A word that is fraught with good cheer, A soul that illumines the eye. "
634,SUCCESS.,"Failure is cheerless, sullen, and glum, His hand hanging idly by, His voice is an echo of woe, His face distorted, awry. "
636,FRAGMENTS.,"This world was made of fragments Each separate from the other, Yet in such close relation As to indicate a brother. "
637,FRAGMENTS.,"Each atom of the universe Has in itself attraction, That finds response so much allied To voluntary action, "
638,FRAGMENTS.,"That one might quickly recognize A power, supreme, benign, That emanates from master hand With forces so divine, "
639,FRAGMENTS.,"That every touch which nature gives To matter or to mind, Must indicate creative power Superior to mankind. "
640,FRAGMENTS.,"What scientist can ever tell The mainspring of all action, If all his reasons fail so prove Molecular attraction? "
641,FRAGMENTS.,"It has its source from out the space, Beyond the astral heaven; It had a purpose to perform, Or it had not been given. "
642,FRAGMENTS.,"We may not know its secret laws Or understand its source, But faith has taught us to be wise And recognize its force. "
643,FRAGMENTS.,"Of all the teeming millions now Upon this mundane sphere, Not one can give a reason For his living presence here. "
644,FRAGMENTS.,"'Tis strange, and yet we know 'tis true, We constantly are dying, All things are old, nothing is new, And life with death is vying. "
645,FRAGMENTS.,"We know not when this all will cease, We cannot understand Why matter never may increase, Or seas become dry land. "
646,FRAGMENTS.,"Enough we know to serve the end For which we were designed, God never yet was known to send The blind to lead the blind. "
647,FRAGMENTS.,"If we but act an honest part, And use the powers given, When from this earth we shall depart, We may be wise in heaven. "
649,A BEACON LIGHT.,"Adown the vistas of the past I cast my memory's eye, And see bright scenes receding fast,-- Some hopes in ruins lie; Yet still there shines a beacon light Whose ray on me descends, And shows in its effulgency A circle of true friends. "
650,A BEACON LIGHT.,"The magic charm this circle yields Is richer far to me, Than cattle in a thousand fields Or gems from the deep sea; It whispers softly in my ears And cheers me on my way, Gives faith for doubt and murky fears, And comfort for dismay. "
652,MEMORY.,"Earthly scenes are worth preserving, Bitter though they sometimes be; Who would wish to sink in Lethe All the fruits of Memory? None could dare offend his Maker By a wish so rash and vain; For by this kind boon from Heaven Life is all lived o'er again. "
653,MEMORY.,"In the silent hour of twilight, Thoughts of by-gone days will come, Stealing o'er our better feelings, Bringing back our early home; All the soothing words of friendship Spoken by a tongue now still, Touch the fountains near our heart-strings, And our eyes with moisture fill. "
654,MEMORY.,"Tender, oh, how sweetly tender, Are the musings of an hour, When the mellowing scenes around us Give to Memory magic power; Thought recalls those scenes long parted, Life epitomized appears, Moments then reflect a lifetime Reaching back through many years. "
655,MEMORY.,"Oh, how blessed are those moments! Present scenes can never fire Such a rapture in our bosom As fond Memory can inspire; Naught on earth can e'er be spoken To attract the living ear, Like the words of the departed Uttered when among us here. "
656,MEMORY.,"Time and Death have made them sacred, Memory calls them oft to mind, And her choicest, dearest treasures, She for them has oft entwined; This is but a simple homage, Richly paying him who kneels; He who's prompted by such feelings, For his fellow being feels. "
657,MEMORY.,"Dark must be that soul enshrouded, Which Oblivion would prefer To the soothing power of Memory And the influence shed by her: Life itself is not worth having If deprived of such a bliss, Earth has not another treasure That we may compare with this. "
659,DISCONTENT.,"Let quiet people talk of peace-- Contentment of the mind, But he who lives at perfect ease Can never bless mankind. "
660,DISCONTENT.,"If each no higher end should seek Than that which now he fills, But be content, subdued, and meek, 'Twould bring a thousand ills. "
661,DISCONTENT.,"Advancement then would have an end. Progression then would cease, Invention have no earnest friend, And science no increase. "
662,DISCONTENT.,"But Discontent, though called a fiend, Is progress in disguise, 'Tis _this_ by which our end's attained, 'Tis _this_ by which we rise. "
663,DISCONTENT.,"The pupil may surpass the sage If such his aim shall be, May fathom truths for many an age Were wrapped mystery. "
664,DISCONTENT.,"The genius may invent some plan To ease the laborer's toil, Or add facility for man To cultivate the soil. "
665,DISCONTENT.,"Contentment never did aspire To elevate mankind, It never raised the standard higher Of science or of mind. "
666,DISCONTENT.,'Tis Discontent that gains the prize In every useful art; Although it brings us tearful eyes And restlessness of heart; 
667,DISCONTENT.,"But then it has a sweet reward-- Progression is the fruit, But some this sweetness have abhorred For others have the boot. "
668,DISCONTENT.,"For he who blesses most mankind, Himself is seldom blessed, And he whose deeds should be enshrined Will seldom be caressed. "
669,DISCONTENT.,"Yet, let our banner ne'er be furled, Our lives in quiet spent; For 'tis a truth that all the world Still thrives on Discontent. "
671,OUR POLITICS.,"""The purification of politics is an iridescent dream."" U. S. Senator, John J. Ingalls, Kansas. "
672,OUR POLITICS.,"""Purification of politics Is an iridescent dream,"" Is the Ingalls way of saying that Corruption's power's supreme. "
673,OUR POLITICS.,"Have the people lost their honesty, Has the Nation sunk so low, That partisan strife can blind our eyes Till we know not friend from foe? "
674,OUR POLITICS.,"If such be true, this fair land of ours Must fail to mature the Hope That blossomed fair on Liberty's tree, But in impotence must grope. "
675,OUR POLITICS.,"Beautiful land! God's own favored land! Thy sons must united be, Statesmen should now hold the public helm, Throw factions into the sea, "
676,OUR POLITICS.,"Teach politicians with all their schemes, The people yet are supreme; That Augean stables--politics-- May be cleansed by ballot's streams. "
678,SUNSET.,"Softly the tints of expiring day Tinge th' vaults of Hesperian heaven, Leaving a trace of the sun's mellow ray To escort the shadows of even. "
679,SUNSET.,"All of the gates of Phoebus are drawn, Yet his splendor has left to sight A trail of enchantment to linger till dawn, To charm the still hours of the night. "
680,SUNSET.,"Scenes of such cloud-land often reveal A grandeur that augments the soul; Heaven has no beauties it seeks to conceal, No secrets inscribed on its scroll. "
681,SUNSET.,"Through the earth for an age we may roam, And through space our vision may fly, Yet no pleasure is like that at home When we gaze on a God-painted sky. "
682,SUNSET.,"When we think of the forces displayed To prepare for a cloud-scene at even, Of the elements deftly arrayed That a gorgeous effect may be given, "
683,SUNSET.,"Of the mists and the winds and the light, Of the blendings that art cannot teach, Of the mysteries hidden from sight That our knowledge would gladly reach, "
684,SUNSET.,"Of the order, the purpose, design, In the pictures that hang in the sky, We know that the hand is divine That arranged all their brilliancy, "
685,SUNSET.,"Then our faith lifts the curtain that hides The Spirit that ordered the plan, And assures us He ever abides To encourage and elevate man. "
686,SUNSET.,"At sunset my spirit shall sing Of the beauties the elements yield, Let my heart then its off'ring bring To the Artist of sky and of field. "
687,SUNSET.,"When my soul from its dwelling of clay, Shall escape to that unknown sphere, May it be at the close of the day, When the glories of sunset appear. "
688,SUNSET.,"Soothingly, sweetly comes unto me The thought that my soul may rest, In a land whose glory shall be Like cloud-scenes that glow in the west. "
690,SELFISHNESS.,"Who lives for self alone should be Placed in some lonely, hollow tree, And left to toad and bat and owl-- To creatures man considers foul-- Where he shall be perpetual prey For frightful ogres night and day. "
691,SELFISHNESS.,"A narrow soul that lives for self, Should stand on some old musty shelf, Where spiders, rats, and vermin throng, And listen only to the song Of filing saw and creaky mill, And owlet's hoot and whip-poor-will. "
692,SELFISHNESS.,"Who lives for self is not afraid Of meanest thing God ever made, For he himself is that same thing; Though peasant, plebian, or king, He thwarts the purpose of God's plan, He lacks the impulse of a man. "
693,SELFISHNESS.,"No soul enwrapped within itself, Or dwarfed by pride, or love of pelf, Can serve its Maker or mankind As nobly as was erst designed By the Great Architect above, Whose being is Unselfish Love. "
695,RETROSPECTION.,"I sit when the shadows are stealing The light of departing day, And think of the scenes and pleasures I enjoyed in my childhood's play. "
696,RETROSPECTION.,"I can picture them all so plainly, They seemed not a day gone by, I recall the fields and garden, The lake and the clear blue sky. "
697,RETROSPECTION.,"I can see the bright water flowing At the foot of the sloping hill, The dam that impeded its progress, The toy-wheel of water-mill. "
698,RETROSPECTION.,"I can trace every line and feature Of trees and the shadows they cast, The lanes, the rocks, and orchards, That on journey to school were past. "
699,RETROSPECTION.,"I can close my eyes for an instant And draw a scene to my mind, That seems like a photo-engraving, As true, as complete, as defined. "
700,RETROSPECTION.,"Time's flight has not dim'd or shaded One outline the scenes gave then, Though the years that have intervened, Are nearly two score and ten. "
701,RETROSPECTION.,"There's a central, attractive figure, With heart unselfish and warm, That always appears in the picture-- 'Tis my mother's benignant form. "
702,RETROSPECTION.,"I can see her in all the beauty And glow of a mother's pride, As she patiently watched and labored For her children at her side. "
703,RETROSPECTION.,How sweet to my soul is the power To so clearly these scenes portray; I pray that to life's latest hour This bliss be not taken away. 
705,ALONE.,"""And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.""--Gen. 2, 18. "
706,ALONE.,"Alone! God saw His creature man, Deprived of great felicity, And changed the order of His plan That earth in harmony might be With all the products of the spheres, Which move in such perfect accord, That through aeons of passing years They but proclaim a perfect Lord. "
707,ALONE.,"The earth was fair and fresh and young, The stars hung in a cloudless sky, Sweet perfumes on the air were flung From every breeze went laughing by; The brook and bird in wanton glee, Attuned their notes in such refrain That earth was full of minstrelsy, And heaven re-echoed it again. "
708,ALONE.,"God's image, man, heard not the strain, No beauty charmed his listless eye, Earth spread her treasures but in vain, In vain shone the bejeweled sky; Earth gave no food for hungry _heart_, No solace-cup from which to sip, Defective seemed Nature and Art, To _soul_ robbed of _companionship_. "
709,ALONE.,"A ""help meet"" then to man was given, To _soothe_ and _cheer_ his lonely way; Eve was an afterthought of Heaven That crowned the last creation-day. Create anew, Almighty Power, A ""help meet"" for the desolate, Let no wild sophistry devour The solace Thou didst last create. "
711,LOVE.,"[Written after reading Shakespeare's sonnet commencing, ""Love is not Love which alters when it alterations finds.""] "
712,LOVE.,"Love is a sort of cannibal And lives upon its kind, It dares all dangers, fears no foes And to the world is blind, While faithful heart unswerving beats, Or pines in forced retreat; It deems all tortures fate may send Are perfumed with the sweet Aroma of implicit faith, Born of a kindred soul That to the outer things of life Spurns puny hate's control. "
713,LOVE.,"Love, undeceived, is perfect bliss When trust reciprocates The purest, sweetest touch that Heaven Within the soul creates; But fierce Vesuvius cannot burn With such destructive flame, As fires Love's victim of deceit Stung by the taunts that claim No truthful fountain as their source, No mild-voiced Justice to allay The cauldron of defenseless fraud Distilled through treachery. "
714,LOVE.,"Love that dissembles is not love, But a subtle treachery,-- A siren with a charming voice That sounds o'er a mirror sea,-- A beacon light set to allure From a harbor safe and calm,-- A soothing drug whose deadly power Yields to no proffered balm,-- A smiling face with winsome glow But poisonous, blasting breath, That breathes upon its victim, draughts Of sorrow, tears, and death. "
715,LOVE.,"Love that would gain a mastery To wield for pelf or power, Is not a love born clean and pure O'er which no evils lower, But like a miasmatic clime That yields delicious fruit, It hides the venom it distills, And seeks its sole repute In outward show and pageantry, Wherein are deep concealed The poisoned arrows plumed for death, It would not have revealed. "
716,LOVE.,"Unselfish love is but a spark Of God's own spirit dropped from Heaven, The richest boon, the sweetest joy, That unto mortals God hath given; Within itself it hath a power To lift the soul on joyous wings, Attune the heart to harmonies, And softly touch the tensioned strings That vibrate in such unison With other strings so like its own, That not a discord may be heard In cadence, blend, or tone. "
718,LOVE.,"As a cricket sang his song to me On a late September eve, The tone had a sadness in it, That over my spirit did weave A spell of gloom, at the requiem He sang in his solitude, For the dying year, th' fading leaf, And flowers by frost subdued. "
720,LIES.,"If aught on earth my soul can fire, 'Tis the deception of a liar Who with soft smoothness of the tongue, Has promises and pledges strung To suit all needs that come to hand, To serve the purpose Satan planned. "
721,LIES.,"Satan himself, I think, would shun The presence of that artful one, Who violates truth's sacred laws, Regardless of the end or cause, But deems it strategy to live For the sole purpose to deceive. "
722,LIES.,"If hell has any corner where Vile culprits may be doomed to share The merits they richly deserve, It should be held in strict reserve For them whose flattery and art Are used to kill a trusting heart. "
723,LIES.,"Let me abhor, loathe, and despise The author of those fiendish lies, Who would for pleasure, greed, or power, The confidence of youth devour, And blight the soul with foul distrust, Or trample honor in the dust. "
724,LIES.,"No sting of pain can e'er atone, No purging fire was ever known For cleansing of a heart defiled By falsehood; though it may be styled In diction, affability, It poisons like the upas tree. "
725,LIES.,"Beware the tongue that will deceive, At last 'twill cause your soul to grieve Though smooth its accents now may be, Its motive power is treachery, Its fruits are laden with disease, Although its tones may often please. "
726,LIES.,"Dissimulation's oily tongue Will grace Simplicity, among Her unsuspecting, trustful throng, That he may do her greater wrong, And covertly defile the pure, Some envied purpose to secure. "
728,HEARTSTRINGS.,"The tiny trembling tendons That twine about the heart, Are chords that yield a music Unknown to vocal art. "
729,HEARTSTRINGS.,"Though soft the notes are sounded, Each vibration tells a tale Of the mellow, winsome sunshine, Or of fierce, destructive gale. "
730,HEARTSTRINGS.,"Though the strings be few in number, They have compass far beyond The myriad chords around them, That are less delicately tuned. "
731,HEARTSTRINGS.,"List we softly to the music As its volumes gently roll, Varied in their intonation By the tension of the soul. "
732,HEARTSTRINGS.,"Ecstatic measures fill us With a rapture so profound, That we fancy heaven's portals With such harmonies abound. "
733,HEARTSTRINGS.,"Each note is rich in meaning, Each tone is full and clear To the charming sweet delusion Of imagination's ear. "
734,HEARTSTRINGS.,"If you would hear this music And be charmed by its tone, Attune your heart to harmony, For the music is its own. "
735,HEARTSTRINGS.,"No lessons conned in schooldays, No studied forms of art, Can profit us so greatly As communion with our heart. "
736,HEARTSTRINGS.,"It will sing us songs of rapture, Though silent each may be; It will help to solve the questions Of life's great mystery. "
737,HEARTSTRINGS.,If one would hear sweet harmony He carefully must live; For these songs will be an echo Of the keynote he shall give. 
738,HEARTSTRINGS.,"If heartstrings be but tuned aright Sweet melodies we hear; If strung with envy and deceit, The tone is doleful, drear. "
739,HEARTSTRINGS.,"Then let us tune our hearts with joy, And touch the strings with glee, For honor, truth, and purity, Will bring soul-ecstasy. "
741,WHO KNOWS?,"It matters not what be our lot Upon this mundane sphere, In spite of fears and burning tears While we shall linger here, We must depend on foe or friend For many things we need To give the soul that full control Which makes it strong indeed. "
742,WHO KNOWS?,"For noble end, make him a friend Who can reciprocate, A kindly act, not to it tacked The proof of reprobate. God only knows whom we may choose And safely trust as brother, The seeming saint may have a taint That proves him quite another. "
743,WHO KNOWS?,"In human dust we scarcely trust The egotistic pious, Who thinks that he from sin is free-- Not subject to its bias; A holy man does all he can For God and human kind; He meekly lives, but counsel gives In language pure, refined. "
746,TWILIGHT HOUR.,"I love to spend the twilight hour When stars their radiance o'er me cast, With that benign mysterious power Which calls up mem'ries of the past, And brings anew the scenes of yore, Like sacred perfume from some shrine Whose hallowed influence ever more Proves life and love of birth divine. Sweet twilight hour! sweet twilight hour! How blissful is thy magic power, At thy return new strength is given To lead me to the gates of heaven. "
747,TWILIGHT HOUR.,"I love at such an hour as this To hold sweet converse with my soul, Anticipate a promised bliss, Or memory's charmed page unroll; To feel life's not alone for me, But has some aim, some end, some plan, Which to the soul gives dignity, And leads toward heaven a fellow man. "
748,TWILIGHT HOUR.,"I love at twilight hour to see The lamps of heaven in glory shine With beacon-light effulgency, To guide me to that land divine, Where dwell the loved of former years, And where no sorrow e'er may come, Where God shall wipe away all tears, And I shall find abiding home. "
749,TWILIGHT HOUR.,"Oh, twilight hour, how sweet thou art! Thy coming oft relieves my pain, Thy soft communings with my heart Prepare me for life's toils again; Drive thou away my sordid thought, And give my soul augmented power; Teach me to use thee as I ought, Thou holy, blessed twilight hour. "
751,TWILIGHT HOUR.,"Let us not lose the heritage Our fathers did bequeath To sons whose grasp should hold secure The prize, till hour of death Shall still the heart, and loose the nerve Whose tension holds secure The magic love of Liberty And Justice, strong and pure. "
753,THE HAIR.,"Since the days of primal story Of Eden's happy pair, A woman's greatest glory Is her glossy flowing hair; It is a safe criterion By which to judge her life, To ascertain, if duly won, She'd prove a worthy wife. "
754,THE HAIR.,"Its color and arrangement, Its sunshine and its storm Prefigure an estrangement, Or friendship true and warm. We dearly love the sunshine Of locks with golden hue, That bear this blessed combine-- Kind, tender, warm, and true. "
755,THE HAIR.,"We read volumes of character In every lock of hair; The life, the mind, the heart's prefer Are plainly written there; No printed index could portray The soul's environment, So plainly and so perfectly As capillary bent. "
756,THE HAIR.,"Beware the frouzy, unkempt lock That speaks of negligence; Regard cosmetic's fancy stock Of little consequence; Trust only such as speak of taste Born of a cultured mind, Whose purposes are pure and chaste Whose structure, soft, refined. "
758,THE HAIR.,A thoughtful mind may lessons draw From faded leaf or broken straw; May beauty see in some lone star That cheers the storm-tossed mariner; May note in solitude some sound Wherein soft harmonies abound; May hear no voice from human lip; Yet dwell in blest companionship. 
760,LIBERTY.,"Into the port where Liberty stands Inviting the nations to woo her, Malefactors swarm from foreign lands, Whose tenets would surely undo her. "
761,LIBERTY.,"Criminals, paupers, the ostracised From all countries beyond the great sea, Flock into the land our fathers prized, And baptized ""The Sweet Land of the Free."" "
762,LIBERTY.,"They come not to build a hearth and home, Or to clear and improve our rich soil, But prowl like wolves that in forest roam, And prey on fruits of our honest toil. "
763,LIBERTY.,"Long were our shores a refuge secure, For the honest, the brave, and the true; With valor and pride, men would endure The trials that for State might accrue. "
764,LIBERTY.,"Men there are yet, who come to our shore, In honor high, of great moral powers, Whose hands give strength to homes we adore, And whose hearts are as loyal as ours. "
765,LIBERTY.,"For these there is room and welcome, too, For there's land quite enough and to spare, But we pray that all the vicious crew To their homes o'er the sea may repair. "
766,LIBERTY.,"Shall we quarantine disease and death, Whose subtle infections float in the air, And grant free power to the pois'nous breath That would strangle our Liberty fair? "
767,LIBERTY.,"Sons of the Nation, arise in might! And then swear by the God we adore, This vicious crowd shall be put to flight, And forever debarred from our shore. "
768,LIBERTY.,"Freedom and Liberty need our care, If from wounds we would e'er keep them free, For a frenzied brain would even dare To destroy through base treachery. "
769,LIBERTY.,"Long live the land unto freedom given, And forever may Liberty stand, With beacon flame from the throne of heaven, And a symbol of Light in her hand. "
770,LIBERTY.,"When stars shall fade from the dome of heaven, And sun shall refuse his golden light; When noon of Time shall be changed to even, And earth shall be lost to human sight; "
771,LIBERTY.,"When crash of worlds and revolving spheres Shall lose in chaos, identity; And Time shall be measured not by years, But on shall roll through eternity; "
772,LIBERTY.,"Then Liberty's form may sink in dust; But loyal sons shall transported be From the mundane scenes of moth and rust, To the perfect home of Liberty. "
773,LIBERTY.,"I ween that when such an hour as this, Shall marshal friends who have fought and died For the sacred cause of earthly bliss, And Freedom's cause have so magnified, "
774,LIBERTY.,There shall be a special crown for him Who has stood undaunted in the fight; But the brightest star in the diadem Is steadfast love for the Truth and Right. 
776,"""LO,"" THE DEPARTED.",The Bison strong and the Indian wild Have departed from our plains; The land where they lived has been defiled By man's greed for worldly gains. 
777,"""LO,"" THE DEPARTED.","The human tide that on them has rolled In merciless energy, In search of that dazzling monarch Gold, Swept on like a mighty sea, "
778,"""LO,"" THE DEPARTED.","Till their prostrate forms, mingled with clay, Enrich the soil once their own; And naught but waters shrink in dismay, And winds in wild sorrow moan. "
779,"""LO,"" THE DEPARTED.","O, beautiful lakes and silver streams, May your names their mem'ry keep; Dear mountains, wake from your silent dreams, When your sides so wild and steep, "
780,"""LO,"" THE DEPARTED.","Shall hear your names in the Indian tongue; And echoes, reverberate The mellow tones of the songs once sung, At the hunter's evening fete. "
782,DRIFTING AWAY.,"How softly, how still, are we drifting away, On the wide Sea of Life as it beckons us on, Though the sunshine allure us 'tis but for a day, Then darkness comes o'er us and hopes are all gone. "
783,DRIFTING AWAY.,"We are drifting away in a bark that is frail, On a sea sometimes rough and whose waves often moan, Yet when all is peaceful we think not of gale, But are drifting away in our bark all alone. "
784,DRIFTING AWAY.,"So softly we float on a smooth flowing sea, That our helm and our anchors are cast to the shore, We think them a burden and wish to be free, From every encumbrance that can serve us no more. "
785,DRIFTING AWAY.,"We are drifting away with our hopes and our fears, To an ocean of life unknown to us now; We see a bright vision--though veiled by our tears, It appears like refulgence to lighten the brow. "
786,DRIFTING AWAY.,"Too slowly our bark seems to drift toward the prize, We in ecstasy wish it to speed faster on; But while we are wishing, a mist dims our eyes, And lo! that bright vision has vanished and gone. "
787,DRIFTING AWAY.,"A gloom of thick darkness now spreads like a pall, The winds of the tempest arise in their force, And amid their wild shriekings for succor we call On Him who reigns o'er us, to mark out our course. "
788,DRIFTING AWAY.,"We plead for protection from ruin and pain, Repiningly think of our anchor and helm, And could we secure those lost prizes again, No tempest could shake us, no wave could o'erwhelm. "
789,DRIFTING AWAY.,"But swiftly we're drifting, we cannot tell where, The current moves onward regardless of gloom, We raise our weak voices and utter a prayer That God in His mercy is drifting us home. "
791,DRIFTING AWAY.,"The silver stream by the farmhouse door Flows on and on forever, But the feet that trod its oaken floor Have crossed the mystic river, And no wind kissed by a vernal sun Can return them e'er again; Their earthly pilgrimage is done, They dwell in a new domain. "
793,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"Oh, give me some heart of a kindred spirit That smiles when I smile, or that weeps when I weep, Whose solace is greater by far to inherit Than the wealth of the mines or the gems of the deep. "
794,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"Some heart that will echo response to my feeling, That thrills with delight when I speak of my joy; That sorrows with sorrow too deep for concealing, When cankering griefs make my own heart's alloy. "
795,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"Some heart that appreciates each little kindness, That knows all my feelings, tho' oft unexpressed, That sees not my faults with a passionate blindness, But clings to my soul when 'tis sorely distressed. "
796,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"Some heart whose affection can never be blighted, That beats all in concert with that of my own, That revels in pleasures with which I'm delighted, And grieves at the sorrows which cause me to moan. "
797,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"Some heart that can never be swerved from its mooring, Though tempests may thunder and billows may roar, That espouses my fate in spite of such roaring, And when trials are sorest will trust even more. "
798,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"My heart would exult to find such a treasure, And return ev'ry throb in fidelity's pride, Would suffer if need be, and call it but pleasure To live or to die for a heart so allied. "
799,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"No frown of the world could e'er cause me to tremble While trusting my all in a heart such as this, Too fond to deceive me; too true to dissemble-- 'Twere a foretaste of Heaven, the acme of bliss. "
800,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"Can it be, can it be, the world is so varied, Human hearts never beat on chords that are even! Is versatile man so odd, or so seared That perfect accord is known but in Heaven! "
801,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"My heart shall rejoice that some kindred vibrations Soothe the devious marge of the pathway of fate, And gathering strength through many privations Shall learn in contentment to patiently wait. "
803,KINDRED SPIRITS.,"To sit an hour on lichened stone, Or mould'ring log by moss o'ergrown, And use our ears and eyes, Will teach us the effect and cause Of many of great Nature's laws That now are mysteries. "
805,SCHOOL DAYS.,"Can we e'er forget our boyhood, And the days we spent at school, With the jolly youths and maidens Who with pencil for a tool, Squared the area of a circle, And minutely did compute The interest and discount On a promissory note? "
806,SCHOOL DAYS.,"As we worked those ""grazing"" questions, We could see the cattle eat; See the grass grow up by inches Beneath their cloven feet; We could surely hear a lowing That distinctly called our names, Inviting us to pastures To enjoy our childish games. "
807,SCHOOL DAYS.,"If the day were warm and pleasant, The calling seemed more clear Than when chilly winds were sighing, And the clouds were dark and drear; It was no imagination, For a schoolboy's mind is real, Though we heard that calling often We answered it with zeal. "
808,SCHOOL DAYS.,"Then we worked like real bankers And claimed ""three days of grace;"" Then we figured ""hare and greyhound"" In their leaping, jaunty race; We desired an illustration Of the problems to be solved, As no concrete computation From the abstract e'er evolved. "
809,SCHOOL DAYS.,"We solved the size of fishes, When some fraction and a part Were all the given bases To test our ""number"" art, But we never were contented With the fishes in the book, So we strolled off to the lakeside, Or down the purling brook. "
810,SCHOOL DAYS.,"Then we had some given acres In the form of perfect square, And a fence around its border With a circle must compare, Which would cost the greater money To fence it in with rails, Or build with posts and stringers, Sawed lumber, and cut nails. "
811,SCHOOL DAYS.,"Then we worked upon that problem Which has never yet been solved, How to live and be contented In the scenes life has evolved, Though in every operation Much must be inferred, We will find this root's extraction Will often prove a surd. "
812,SCHOOL DAYS.,"As life's day of sunshine lingers, Ere the darkness draws apace, 'Tis a blessed satisfaction To look backward o'er the race, And feel that in the running, Our best was ever done, And know that at the ending, Some trophy must be won. "
813,SCHOOL DAYS.,"Though the eye may lose its clearness And the touch may lose its thrill, Though the senses fail to gather All the promptings of the will, May the mind retain its power To recall the days of yore, Till the spirit casts its anchor On that far-off unseen shore. "
814,SCHOOL DAYS.,"When on that shore safe landed, It seems to be quite plain That the greatest satisfaction Will be to think of youth again; There must be a great transition From this mundane sphere below, If the thoughts of early boyhood May not set all heaven aglow. "
816,PERHAPS.,"Perhaps had I chosen some other profession Than that of moulding the human mind, I might have secured a greater possession Of lucre and treasures and powers combined, Than all I may now of these truly own; But I have in my casket some jewels I treasure Far more than all stocks and houses and lands, In gold and silver their worth has no measure, For none may compute warm hearts and true hands, When the shadows of years are over us thrown. "
818,PERHAPS.,"There are two kinds of discontent-- Malignant, and progressive,-- The latter is the proper sort, Of it, be quite possessive. The former, born of parentage Whose motive powers are evil, Serves but one purpose here below-- To aid its father--Devil. "
820,IMPORTANT MOMENTS.,"There are times when the fate of nations May hang on a moment's call; When spheres in their mute rotations May swing on a hinge so small, That the breath of a spirit's pinion Might unpoise a balanced world, And lost to law's dominion Through endless space be hurled. "
821,IMPORTANT MOMENTS.,"There are times when the herdsman's calling May vibrate thro' alpine ranch Till the pendent drop, by its falling, Sweeps down in an avalanche, Till the mountain trembles and totters 'Neath the mighty force of snow, And the lives and homes of the cotters Are lost in the vale below. "
822,IMPORTANT MOMENTS.,"There are times when the mind's inaction Has robbed the soul of power, When moments of deep reflection Arrive at so late an hour That they lose the force of their mission In the laggard way they come, And like withered buds of fruition, Are lifeless, powerless, dumb. "
823,IMPORTANT MOMENTS.,"There are words that have been spoken That have echoed on thro' years; Though the vessel has been broken That voiced them to our ears, Yet they come with increased ardor As the years are passing by, Since the soul stood on the border Of vast eternity. "
824,IMPORTANT MOMENTS.,"There are scenes that ever mirror Their forms in thought divine, That with lapse of time grow dearer Till we hold them as some shrine, Wherein are kept the treasures Of Faith and Trust and Love-- A trio fraught with pleasures Drawn from the realms above. "
825,IMPORTANT MOMENTS.,"There are hours upon whose decision The fate of a soul may be; Though clouds may obscure the vision And we pray for a light to see The way that shall lead to heaven, And keep our pathway bright, We can use but the knowledge given And walk in our purest light. "
826,IMPORTANT MOMENTS.,"Let us scan each hour's requisition And answer every demand, Knowing that want of decision Is a foe we cannot withstand; If we shrink from performing our duty, Or tardily fashion our thought, Life loses its charm and its beauty And existence profits us naught. "
828,IMPORTANT MOMENTS.,"We know that like all human Our work is imperfect at best, And will bristle with imperfections Till our hands shall be at rest; But to justify our blunders Or pass them lightly o'er, Is the fatal way of inviting A thousand errors more. "
830,WHO SHALL JUDGE?,"We know not all that we have done, Nor may we ever know; No field was ever lost or won, Until the final blow Has registered itself in Heaven, And every impulse known, That tells a reason why 'twas given, To Him upon the Throne. "
831,WHO SHALL JUDGE?,"Then let us boast not of our deeds, Nor let our true hearts fail, Because we think some plan succeeds While others ne'er prevail; For he who works as best he can With lofty, pure intent, Will not be judged by puny man, But God Omnipotent. "
833,WHO SHALL JUDGE?,"This earth is a place of probation, A school wherein man may secure A knowledge of his true relation, To the noble, the true, and the pure. "
835,THE FUTURE.,"I know not what the future May have in store for me, I only know that God is God And He may trusted be. "
836,THE FUTURE.,"The past with all its pleasure And all its sorrow too, Has been but a probation To prove me false or true. "
837,THE FUTURE.,If in my earthly mission No progress has been made Toward a higher spirit-- No growth of soul displayed-- 
838,THE FUTURE.,"Then dark, sad, and foreboding The future must appear, The soul must shrink in terror When death's hour draweth near. "
839,THE FUTURE.,"If in the past no brother Has felt my outstretched hand, To aid him on his pilgrimage Toward a better land, "
840,THE FUTURE.,No word of mine brought solace To a weary careworn soul; No hand of mine has pointed To the Christian's heavenly goal; 
841,THE FUTURE.,"No thought, or word, or action To lead to better life; No balm to heal deep anguish; No anodyne for strife; "
842,THE FUTURE.,"Then shall I hear the sentence, ""You did it not to me,"" Come from the sacred Teacher Who taught in Gallilee. "
843,THE FUTURE.,"If I have wronged my brother, In action or in thought; Have forced him into sorrow, Or counted him as naught, "
844,THE FUTURE.,"Have borne false witness of him Or robbed him of his peace; Unjustly taken from him Or hindered his increase, "
845,THE FUTURE.,"The words of condemnation, ""You did it unto me,"" Will fill my soul with terror, Distress, and misery. "
846,THE FUTURE.,My soul has wronged no being Of just and honest part; But on this sole reliance It would not dare depart. 
847,THE FUTURE.,"Not in its own weak merit, Not in itself alone, But in the great redemption Of Him who did atone "
848,THE FUTURE.,"For man, and bid him enter, The gates of joy and rest, Through faith, and prayer, and penitence, Upon a Savior's breast. "
849,THE FUTURE.,"I shrink not at the future Whatever it may be, But joy in full assurance Of faith's expectancy. "
851,THE FUTURE.,"Let me pass away when my work is done, Like a cloudless day whose setting sun Leaves a smile on the evening sky; Let this transient clay when deprived of breath, With the earth yet stay, it alone knows death, Myself must live on and cannot die. "
853,ERE AND AT MY CALL.,"Ere I lay me down the burden That my soul on earth hath worn, Let me feel before departing, That my tree of life hath borne Fruitage that shall ever onward Move mankind along the road, Toward the haven of the blessed Toward the city of my God. "
854,ERE AND AT MY CALL.,"Let some word that I have spoken Or some act performed by me, Sound aloud thro' coming ages Making captive souls more free; Not to bring me earthly glory Nor to win me empty fame, But to prove the mighty power In a risen Savior's name. "
855,ERE AND AT MY CALL.,"Let my work be all completed When the summons comes to go; Let there be no cause for weeping, Let there be no sound of woe, When the spirit from my Father Beckons me from duty done, To appear at His tribunal, And receive the crown that's won. "
856,ERE AND AT MY CALL.,"Let there be a joyous sunset, Lighting all the realm above With the radiance and the glory Of a Savior's dying love; Let my faith be firm, unshaken, Let His hand be clasped in mine, Let me cross the mystic river, Leaning on His breast divine. "
858,BODING SNOW.,"The sky that was blue and sunny, Has changed to a granite gray, The sun that was soft and cheery, Refuses it mellow ray; On the distant tree-top, cawing, Sits a solitary crow; These and the shivering children Betoken the coming snow. "
859,BODING SNOW.,"Soon the flakes will be falling, Like down from an angel's wing, That is sent from the starry regions For Nature's covering; The trees, the plants, the grasses, With rev'rence bow their heads, For the pure and fleecy mantle That God above them spreads. "
861,AN OPEN BOOK.,"How strange are the stories we sometimes read In faces we meet by the way, They unconsciously tell of motive or deed That the tongue would refuse to betray. "
862,AN OPEN BOOK.,"Each lineament is a page set apart To be studied and understood By the shade that reflects the mind and heart, In their varied forms and mood. "
863,AN OPEN BOOK.,"The eye oft reflects the secrets of soul That are occult to all beside, And form of the mouth defying control Betrays what the heart fain would hide. "
864,AN OPEN BOOK.,"The quivering chin and tear-bedewed eye That respond to a kindred word That unconsciously fell from a tongue passing by, Oft betrays how th' heart has been stirred. "
865,AN OPEN BOOK.,"There are fountains so deep in some human lives That from them no draught can be drawn, Save the perfect mirage the face ever gives Of the soul when reflections dawn. "
866,AN OPEN BOOK.,"How varied the pages we daily read-- Some are joyous and full of glee, While others may tell of brave hearts that bleed, And then break in deep misery. "
867,AN OPEN BOOK.,"The facial page to me hath a charm That no printed book can impart, 'Tis no fancied tale, 'tis no false alarm, But stern truths from the human heart. "
868,AN OPEN BOOK.,"Pencils write plainly each act, on the face, Each motive indulged is seen there, No after decision can fully erase The masks faces ever must wear. "
869,AN OPEN BOOK.,"If the face would be fair and bright and young, Wear a charming, a joyous hue, To truth and to right heart-strings must be strung, Every thought, every act must be true. "

"
878,SOME CHARACTERS I MUCH ADORE.,"The man who fills a humble lot As best he can, and murmurs not At what he has, or has not got, But uses all his power To elevate his work and life, And knows no mean ignoble strife, With which the world is too much rife, Is character I much adore. "

883,SOME CHARACTERS I CAN'T ADMIRE.,"The seeming saint with long drawn face, Who thinks that he has so much grace He should be throned on highest place To which saints may aspire, And yet, when dealing with a man, Will use some vicious, subtle plan By which a vantage he may gain, Is character I can't admire. "

893,ON BROOKLYN BRIDGE.,"I stood upon the slender link That joins two cities into one, And saw from thence the storm-clouds drink Their moisture from the sun. "
894,ON BROOKLYN BRIDGE.,"I watched their lowering, frowning edge, Girt round with silver band, Saw castles tall and towering ledge Assume their forms so grand. "

904,THEIR LIFE IS WHAT THEY MAKE IT.,"Let melancholy mortals grieve And tell their tale of sorrow, Their gloomy spirits to relieve, But all returns to-morrow; For all the while they court their grief, Unwilling to forsake it, And in the way they seek relief, Their life is what they make it. "
905,THEIR LIFE IS WHAT THEY MAKE IT.,"They brood o'er sorrow day by day, With dreams they are affrighted, But never strive to cast away What most their spirits blighted; And if fair fortune chance to smile And give no cause for sorrow, They're not content to rest awhile, But off they go and borrow. "
906,THEIR LIFE IS WHAT THEY MAKE IT.,"Avoiding all life's pleasant ways Their life is always clouded, They see no happy sunny days, For all in gloom is shrouded; They never see the flowers that bloom As on Life's road they ramble, But in the darkest paths of gloom Are seeking for a bramble. "
907,THEIR LIFE IS WHAT THEY MAKE IT.,"The pleasures of this life do not Depend on its surrounding, But if the heart's trained as it ought, Content will be abounding; The silent heart's the seat of joy, And by continual training Life's trials scarcely will annoy The soul where peace is reigning. "

"
910,THEIR LIFE IS WHAT THEY MAKE IT.,"The atmosphere may be redolent With fragrance from some happy soul Whose unconscious influence has sent Attractive power, like magnetic pole, Till laugh of bright eyes is contagious, Infectious, the mirth of a smile, And the ominous brow umbrageous, Casts aside its lowerings vile. "
912,THE LONE BIRD.,"A solitary bird was seen by the writer, making its toilsome flight against a strong storm-wind. The peculiar undulating flight, the gathering darkness of the night, and the portentous indications of storm suggested this: "
913,THE LONE BIRD.,"Whither away on such winged undulations, Breasting the winds and the tempests wild glee, Lifting your form in graceful vibrations As onward you move like a billowy sea? "
914,THE LONE BIRD.,"Alone, all alone, on wing wide extended, Nerved for the tempest that sounds not afar, Night her dark mantle o'er earth has suspended, Thro' which may not shine e'en the light of one star. "
915,THE LONE BIRD.,"Stop, lonely wanderer, and tell me why mateless, Tell me the story of your solitude; God, e'en a bird has not left so fateless But somewhere there lives a companion for you. "

917,THE LONE BIRD.,"Tell me, yes, tell me, and tell me most truly, Is there just cause why your flight is alone? Is there some stain whereby you are duly Debarred from the pleasures that should be your own? "
918,THE LONE BIRD.,"Still but your wing and confide me the story, Chant it to me in a short plaintive song; Perhaps it may speak of a sweet transient glory That faded and died 'mid disaster and wrong. "
919,THE LONE BIRD.,"Perhaps I may speak some word that has healing For solitude's wounds, e'en sweet tho' they be, For sorrows augment by sacred concealing, And steal from the heart ev'ry wish to be free. "
920,THE LONE BIRD.,"Dear blessed bird! you have stopped at my pleading, My soul aids my ears to catch your sweet tone: ""If life is not sweetened by presence and breeding, 'Tis better by far to travel alone. "
921,THE LONE BIRD.,"""I have learned as my wings have borne me thro' groves Where gods their ambrosial nectar sip, That the heart's best experience ever proves, Joy comes not from _presence_, but _companionship_."" "
923,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"O who has not felt his gay heart beat with gladness, As forth he has wandered some morning in May? It drives away care and relieves us from sadness, It cheers the lone heart and makes us feel gay. "
924,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"We see how all Nature rejoices around us, The plants as they spring from the earth seem to smile, The fresh growing leaves of the groves now surround us, And soft sounds of Spring-time unite to beguile. "

927,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"They tune their sweet voices and sing their devotion, Their hearts seem so light, so merry and free, That ideal beauty graces each motion, While they playfully dart from bush and from tree. "
928,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"Our hearts beat with rapture too great for expression While viewing sweet Nature, so lovely, so gay, And hearing those sweet lulling sounds in succession, We wished in our joy it always were May. "
929,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"Thus tempted to linger and spend one short hour, In looking around us in bliss most supreme, We found a choice spot in a fine shady bower, Where near it there murmured a bright silver stream. "
930,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"From this lovely spot we intently were watching The scenes that surround us on this merry May, Every strain of grove-music our ears were now catching, And we saw every movement that came in our way. "
931,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"A sweet, tiny bird on a twig near the river, Was warbling softly his choice matin lay, While near on a branch we soon did discover A serpent preparing to make him his prey. "
932,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"Then glancing the eye to a branch that was near them, We saw there a nest that contained a young brood; While this parent bird was singing to cheer them, The other returned to the nest with their food. "
933,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"The worm which she held in her beak she soon gave them, Then off in the thicket she darted again, To seek for their food, and from hunger relieve them; But on her return how great was her pain! "
934,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"For while she had wandered, this serpent intruder Had charmed her loved mate, as he sat on the spray, His sweet song had ceased, and his notes became ruder, But his fluttering wings could not bear him away. "
935,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"We flew to the rescue--struck down the invader Before the sweet songster had yielded his life, Put an end to this cunning and mischievous raider, And quieted all of the songster's great strife. "
936,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"We learned from the scenes of this morning's ramble That moments of happiness soon may decay; While plucking the flowers to beware of the bramble, Which hid among blossoms may sadly betray. "
937,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"We learned that the joys of this world are not lasting; That what we call pleasure may be a vain show; While joys seem the sweetest they only are blasting, And happiness frequently ends in great woe. "
938,A LESSON FROM NATURE.,"We learned that when Nature seems most to invite us, To build some fond hope on some loved scheme of ours, That there may be sadness preparing to blight us, Which evades all our watchings, defies all our powers. "
940,MY MOTHER'S LOVE.,"Nine months after writing this poem, my mother died, Dec. 21st, 1894. "
941,MY MOTHER'S LOVE.,"My vision eye beholds a form, Bent low by years of life's fierce storm, That moves with feeble tread; Though time has worn that weary frame The heart still keeps its sacred flame True, undiminished. "
942,MY MOTHER'S LOVE.,"No power but Death can ever quell-- No mortal tongue can ever tell A mother's boundless love; 'Tis shadowed in the secret sigh, Or in the moisture of the eye-- E'en silence, it may prove. "
943,MY MOTHER'S LOVE.,"Itself and I had but one birth, It came from heaven to gladden earth-- And brighten man's abode; To feel the magic of its power Is richer boon than any dower The earth has yet bestowed. "
944,MY MOTHER'S LOVE.,"Favored in this has been my lot; Relentless Death has robbed me not-- Though fifty years have flown, Of all the ecstasy and joy That came to me when but a boy, Or since to manhood grown, "
945,MY MOTHER'S LOVE.,"Of that benign maternal smile, Whose magic influence can beguile My heart from worldly care, And lead me toward that beacon-light Of motive pure and act aright, No matter when or where. "
946,MY MOTHER'S LOVE.,"O blessed influence of the past! May all my mother's counsels last Until my heart shall cease To send its crimson current round The tenement wherein 'tis bound, And Death shall bring release. "
947,MY MOTHER'S LOVE.,"Still let these visions come to me Of her I would so gladly see Though far from her I roam; They bring sweet memory of the past, Which but a few more years may last, Of happiness and home. "
949,THE EVENING BEFORE MY BROTHER'S FIFTY-THIRD BIRTHDAY.,"Dear Brother, how the time speeds on And leaves its trace upon our forms; The days of sunny youth are gone And age unfits us for the storms That gather oft for you and me-- To-morrow you'll be fifty-three. "
950,THE EVENING BEFORE MY BROTHER'S FIFTY-THIRD BIRTHDAY.,"It seems but yesterday since youth Was all aglow within our hearts, But still we recognized the truth, Old age has pierced us with his darts Until from pains we are not free-- To-morrow you'll be fifty-three. "
951,THE EVENING BEFORE MY BROTHER'S FIFTY-THIRD BIRTHDAY.,"Long years of toil and anxious care Have left their records all too plain; The failing eye, the snowy hair, The limbs and body racked with pain, Tell tales that all the world can see-- To-morrow you'll be fifty-three. "
952,THE EVENING BEFORE MY BROTHER'S FIFTY-THIRD BIRTHDAY.,"Still on life's battlefield we'll fight And win such victories as we may, Believing still that right is might And faithful hearts shall win the day; Then let us shout and sing with glee-- To-morrow you'll be fifty-three. "
953,THE EVENING BEFORE MY BROTHER'S FIFTY-THIRD BIRTHDAY.,"And when a few more days are past And we are bowed with years and care, The cheerful sunshine still may last To make declining years more fair; Ah! much I hope that this may be-- To-morrow you'll be fifty-three. "
954,THE EVENING BEFORE MY BROTHER'S FIFTY-THIRD BIRTHDAY.,"'Tis sweet to think of boyhood's days And all the happiness they gave, To summon back life's earliest plays And call lost childhood from its grave; Thus memory gives us victory-- To-morrow you'll be fifty-three. "
955,THE EVENING BEFORE MY BROTHER'S FIFTY-THIRD BIRTHDAY.,"Since manhood's form was given me Until this hour, our ways have been In different lines of industry, And scarce have we each other seen; Your birthday's held in memory-- To-morrow you'll be fifty-three. "
957,MY BROTHER'S BIRTHDAY.,"Fifty-eight to-day, fifty-eight to-day! How years of your life have sped away, And left in the brown of the dying year A quiet content, devoid of fear At the onward march of Time's noiseless feet, Which ever advance, but ne'er retreat, As they bear you on to that silent shore, From which earth's mortals return no more. "
958,MY BROTHER'S BIRTHDAY.,"With the night of time come the sunset cares, The faltering step, the snowy hairs, The tottering frame, and the stifled breath, Sure harbingers of approaching death, That bring with their train a tranquil repose Unknown to the tears and sighs and woes That belong to scenes of an active life, Whose atmosphere breathes of toil and strife. "
959,MY BROTHER'S BIRTHDAY.,"As glorious day dies out in the west And sinks in crimson splendor to rest, While the stars of heaven come one by one With reflected light from th' sinking sun, So may life with you in its late decline, Leave a trail of light that yet may shine To illumine the path that others tread, And cheer the way of the vanquished. "
962,TO MY DAUGHTER BLANCHE IN HEAVEN.,"Darling of my bosom, Pride of my loving heart, Hopes were sorely shattered When I saw your life depart; In you I saw my future, Cheered by your smile and voice, Sorrow ceased its frowning, My spirit would rejoice. "
963,TO MY DAUGHTER BLANCHE IN HEAVEN.,Life was made much brighter By your presence sweet; At your cheery coming Heart-shadows would retreat; Soulful songs with meanings Beyond your years were sung; To chords of sweetest rapture Your heart-strings e'er were strung. 
964,TO MY DAUGHTER BLANCHE IN HEAVEN.,"From out the realms of heav'n Still you speak to me, And fancy draws the curtain That I your face may see; Perhaps in the hereafter I yet may fully know The purpose of your going, Your mission here below. "
966,THE VOICE.,"To me comes a voice that none other Hath power to hear or to know, Its cadence so sweet and consoling Is a whisper so gentle and low, That the flight of an angel might covet The silence it bears in its tone; It speaks to me often, to comfort My heart when I sit all alone. "
967,THE VOICE.,"I oft close my eyes at the twilight And that voice comes floating to me Like the song of some fairy creature That dwells in a pearl-lighted sea; When the shades of midnight infold me That voice lulls me gently to rest, And tells me the time is not distant When my spirit shall dwell as its guest. "
968,THE VOICE.,"When shadows of night are departing And smiling Aurora appears, That voice of sweet invitation Falls soothingly into my ears; A form that I fondly cherish Like a vision of beauty I see, That comes on an angelic mission With counsel and solace for me. "
969,THE VOICE.,"How sweet is the voice that is calling-- Is calling in rapture to me And leading me close to the border Where into its home I can see! It tells me the land is not distant, That soon when my boat I must launch, I shall know the voice that is calling, Is the voice my lost darling Blanche. "
971,THE VOICE.,"When Liberty lies wounded, And shrieks in wild despair, Then patriots will cast aside The party garb they wear, And honest hands and hearts unite, To wash away the stain That narrow-minded partisans Would selfishly maintain. "
972,THE VOICE.,"Dear Goddess of our fathers! Our hands shall e'er maintain The sacred trust of keeping free The realm where thou dost reign; And counting not our lives too dear To offer unto thee, We dedicate all that we are To our sweet Liberty. "
974,A PICTURE.,"I sat by the farm-house window When the winter's sun was low, And looked on the clear horizon O'er fields white-crested with snow. "
975,A PICTURE.,"A tree with its arms outstretching, Was limned on the distant sky, And my fancy saw a picture Such as gold can never buy. "
976,A PICTURE.,"Perhaps to no other vision Could the scene be just the same, For blendings in the picture Had on me a special claim. "
977,A PICTURE.,"My mother oft had looked upon That fair picture in the west, While sitting in that self-same chair, Ere she laid her down to rest. "
978,A PICTURE.,"This gave a charm to the picture Of especial power to me, And my vision saw a painting That none else on earth could see. "
979,A PICTURE.,"I can close my eyes at twilight Though now many miles away, And see that lovely horizon At close of expiring day. "
980,A PICTURE.,"I can see the true formation Of each rock and tree and field, In a perfect panorama That time has not yet concealed. "
981,A PICTURE.,"It is not an idle fancy For me now to paint the scene, Since my mother's form has faded From the place where she has been. "
982,A PICTURE.,"I know it affords me comfort To recall from day to day, That scene from the farm-house window, Since my mother passed away. "
985,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,Sacred these walls wherein I find Myself inclosed once more; Here in youth's pride my ardent mind On nightly tasks would pore. 
986,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"Sweet were these tasks, for mental power Comes with each duty done; And ray of light charmed midnight's hour When thought its victory won. "
987,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"Oft did the battle seem severe, Sometimes defeat seemed nigh, But pride and love must persevere When all our powers we try. "
988,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,Struggles bring a development That will not brook defeat; Within us dwells an element That makes just contest sweet. 
989,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"If barriers in our mental path Stand like a sullen foe, Summon the soul, in righteous wrath Strike a decisive blow, "
990,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,And spare not till the victory Puts ignorance to flight; And let the battle-cry e'er be Science and Truth and Right! 
991,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"Such victories, when fairly won, Put slaughter's field to shame, And Honor's self shall place upon Such victors, wreaths of fame. "
992,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"O happy hours within these walls, But happier far to me Is the expanded mind which calls Deep thought, best liberty. "
993,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"That mental power which sees the world As beauty, grace, and art, Wherein God's loveliness unfurled, Speaks to a living heart, "
994,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"And leads it tenderly to see The harmony of laws Which unifies immensity, And tells of the First Cause, "
995,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"Yields greater solace, richer lore, Than books alone can give; For mind and soul form the great power By which we act and live. "
996,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"The wealth that dignifies mankind Is not in bonds and stocks, But in rich thoughts, noble, refined, Needing no bars nor locks. "
997,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"When man for manhood more shall strive, And less for greed and gain, The humble poor may nobly live, And feel not hunger's pain. "
998,MY ROOM IN BOYHOOD'S DAYS.,"These walls are sacred unto me, For thought here learned to soar And build the ark of liberty I love, exalt, adore. "
1000,NATURE'S VOICE.,"Every tree and plant, every tiny flower That grows in wood or field, Hath a voice that calls aloud to me, And a beauty half concealed, That draw my ears to hear a strain Of music sweet and low, And paint for me far richer hues Than the sunset's evening glow; They speak to me as no tongue can speak; Their voices are sweeter far Than the tones that fall from human lips, Or strains of sweet music are. "
1002,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","Perhaps no spot upon this sphere, Has charms for me more sacred, dear, Than those of old Poundridge; I love her hills, her lakes, her streams, Her rural haunts, where Nature teems With joys naught can abridge. "
1003,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","Her dew-bespangled meadows shine With gems of radiance so divine, When touched by matin sun, That myriad pendant drops of dew, Lend to the mead a brilliant hue Like earth with diamonds strown. "
1004,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","The woods that sleep on distant hills, Or watch o'er gently murmuring rills, Seem restful to the soul; Their silence brings sweetest repose, A panacea for the woes That spurn M. D.'s control. "
1005,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","The healthful, healing, peaceful rest, To frame fatigued, to mind distressed, Seems but a foretaste here, Of that serene and blest abode, Which to the faithful child of God Hereafter shall appear. "
1006,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","I love the rustic's rough demesne, Which yields to toil a wealth unseen To those of civic life; For here I drank, in youth's bright dawn, The draughts of vigor which were drawn From labor's busy strife. "
1007,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","I love the house wherein I played, The yard o'erspread by maple's shade, The nearby babbling brook; The fields o'er which my youthful feet Sped onward toward the trout's retreat, With dangling line and hook. "
1008,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","I love the path across the wood Which once I trod in search of food For hungering, thirsting mind, The room where pupils used to meet And strive to make their work complete And manners more refined. "
1009,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","All these I love for what is past, And still must love while life shall last; But I do love still more The souls who fired my mental lamp, And on my character did stamp Truths fraught with richest lore. "
1010,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","I see my aged mother there, My father in his old arm-chair, And fancy hears their voice; My brother yet so full of joy, Has passed the limits of a boy, But still can much rejoice. "
1011,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","Upon the hill, the lakes between, Are sacred mounds of living green, Where sleep my precious dead; A vacant spot reserved for me, To which my heart looks longingly, Invites my weary head. "
1012,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","No greater boon could I e'er ask When I have finished earthly task, Than quietly to rest, Surrounded by her vales and hills, Her laughing lakes and singing rills, And friends that I love best. "
1013,"POUNDRIDGE, N. Y.","Tho' many years now intervene, My mind recalls each boyhood scene Of field and wood and bridge; These cherished memories only prove Abiding faith and filial love Toward restful, old Poundridge. "
1015,TIM.,"We remember well when a schoolboy, When pliant in mind and limb, We had for a boon companion, A bright youth whose name was Tim. "
1016,TIM.,"He was sturdy, strong, and honest, In body and mind he had vim, So we learned by intuition, To place much reliance on Tim. "
1017,TIM.,"We fished and hunted together, In summer, the lakes we would swim, Skated their surface in winter, With mercurial, wonderful Tim. "
1018,TIM.,"Our tasks at school were a union, And when thoughts were distant or dim, A light illumined the pages, That seemed a reflection from Tim. "
1019,TIM.,"Reciprocal visits were often, He slept with me, I slept with him, Talked till near dawn of daylight, With fluent and scholarly Tim. "
1020,TIM.,"Decades have passed since that season, My hair is reduced to a rim, But my heart beats as warm as ever, For that friend of my youth, named Tim. "
1021,TIM.,"As years fleet away, we treasure The power of our mind to skim O'er the scenes of early doings, With valiant and trustworthy Tim. "
1022,TIM.,"A third of a century over, Still a friend have we now like him, Exact in his every bearing, And his name is--unchanged--Tim. "
1023,TIM.,"We wonder if in the hereafter, When we range with the Seraphim, Happiness will be augmented By the kindly presence of Tim. "
1024,TIM.,"We trust an expanded mission Will fill us with joy to the brim, As we ramble the fields of glory, With genial and faithful friend Tim. "
1026,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"On receiving sprigs of Forget-me-not and Lilly-of-the-Valley in envelope, through mail, with no note or name inclosed. "
1027,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"In form it was a letter, Unique in its every part, The expression could not be better, For it touched my inmost heart. "
1028,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"No pen had marred its beauty, No ink had traced a line, It did its silent duty Like a messenger divine. "
1029,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"Upon its page was written No English, French, nor Greek; But a universal language That only flowers can speak. "
1030,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"The colors were pure whiteness And heavenly tints of blue, Excelling all the brightness That art can bring to view. "
1031,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"The Lily-of-the-Valley And sweet Forget-me-not, That grow where perfumes dally In sweet secluded spot, "
1032,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"When sent to tell some story That words cannot express, Are fraught with special glory And richest tenderness. "
1033,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"Their perfumes speak of gladness, Their colors of delight, They neutralize dull sadness, Turn darkness into light. "
1034,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"They link the heart of sender To heart to which they're sent, And unto both will render The sweetness of content. "
1035,THE UNWRITTEN LETTER.,"I love them for their clearness, Their whiteness and their blue; But added to such dearness Is the thought they came from you. "
1038,ALL THINGS ARE SECOND-HANDED.,"""There's no new thing under the sun,"" Said the ancient priest and preacher; What seems now new is only done To quicken some old feature That lies effete, or badly worn, And lacks its pristine rigor, That needs an energizing touch To give it life and vigor. "
1039,ALL THINGS ARE SECOND-HANDED.,"The sun that shines on us to-day, Shone on our ancient parents Who walked upon the primal clay; And science fully warrants That not one atom has been lost, And not one atom added To all the atom matter host, Although some forms have faded. "
1040,ALL THINGS ARE SECOND-HANDED.,"The gorgeous colors that are cast On cloud-land morn and even, Are but reflections of the past That erst had spangled heaven With glories from that mystic throne Whose blendings none can rival, But whose expiring tints, alone, Admit of a revival. "
1041,ALL THINGS ARE SECOND-HANDED.,The rain that drops has dropped before; Our flowers were another's; The songs we sing were sung of yore By long departed brothers; The sounds we hear are but the tones Or echoes of the past; We live among the mouldering bones Of forms too frail to last. 
1042,ALL THINGS ARE SECOND-HANDED.,"Then ask me not for something new, All things are second-handed, The old may sometimes be more true Than that more lately branded; But taking things as best we can, We know 'tis only human To shun a second-handed man, Or a second-handed woman. "
1043,ALL THINGS ARE SECOND-HANDED.,"But let us not be too severe On second-handed matter, For nothing seems to be more clear Than that we should not flatter Our souls into a fatal state, Of scoffing at the common, For who can tell what cruel fate May make of man or woman? "
1045,FACES WE READ.,"One may read from the face at leisure, From the leaf that reflects the soul, The thought, the desire, and the measure That imprint on the facial scroll The innermost mind and its actions, The heart with its strongest desires, The passions, impulses, and factions Which animate clay oft inspires. "
1046,FACES WE READ.,"Ev'ry line of th' face has a father Whose hand has engraven it there, But shades of the spirit are rather Betrayed in the hue of the hair; The pencils of thought, true to nature, Have written their records so plain, That a skillful eye reads each feature That dwells in the heart and the brain. "
1047,FACES WE READ.,"One may peep into occult recesses Which only the face will reveal, May read what the tongue quite represses But the eye cannot fully conceal, May fathom the deepest depressions Where the soul has buried its woe, Where the heart would hold secret sessions With scenes and events long ago. "
1048,FACES WE READ.,"The writer applying for a room at Newpoint Inn, Amityville, Long Island, was informed that the house was full. Some friends, stopping near, kindly invited him to go with them. He accepted. After his departure he sent the following: "
1050,AMITYVILLE.,"""I was a stranger and ye took me in, Hungry and ye fed me,"" No place for me at Newpoint Inn, So home you kindly led me. "
1051,AMITYVILLE.,"Some say the world is cold and sour, Devoid of fellow-feeling, But day by day and hour by hour, To me comes a revealing "
1052,AMITYVILLE.,"That warm hearts beat where'er we go, Kind hands are gladly serving The kindred hearts which ever show They truly are deserving. "
1053,AMITYVILLE.,"The world, indeed, may frigid be When icebergs float around it, But warm, true hearts of constancy, Have uniformly found it "
1054,AMITYVILLE.,"To be a place where fragrant flowers Deprive the thorns of stings, Where sunny souls spend happy hours, And Nature laughs and sings. "
1055,AMITYVILLE.,"We make our paths, we dwell the lives Selected by ourselves; We shape the destiny that gives Our fate to gods or elves. "
1056,AMITYVILLE.,"Then let us know this truth full well Wherever we may be, We have a power to help us dwell In the _ville of amity_. "
1058,AMITYVILLE.,"Robin is a singer; sweet and pure and clear Are the notes he warbles from his covert near; Softly, oh! how softly, at the sunset's glow Does he chant his vespers, plaintive, sweet, and low. "
1059,AMITYVILLE.,"Robin is an artist; he beautifies the stream, The vale, the hill, the meadow, until they truly seem To glow, because his presence gives to each a tongue To echo back the music his minstrel throat has sung. "
1061,TRUE WEALTH.,"The smallest type of manhood that lives, (If manhood it may be called,) Is that which knows no power but wealth That is measured in stocks and gold; It looks in disdain on a working man Who declines to bend his knee, Though in honor's scales he may outweigh The scorner, in great degree. "
1062,TRUE WEALTH.,"There's a wealth that far surpasses all The houses and stocks and gold, That ever was on the market placed, To be by a hireling sold; 'Tis the wealth of manhood, noble, free, And an independent mind That scorns to swerve from justice and truth, But faithfully serves mankind. "
1065,PIOUS PIE POEM PUNS.,"One pious afternoon in June When pyronomics held full sway, My pilot, fancy, led me on To seek new fields, piebald and gay. "
1066,PIOUS PIE POEM PUNS.,"The pianet rested in shade, The lark, piano-voiced, sang not, But pining for some genial maid To pioneer me to a spot, "
1067,PIOUS PIE POEM PUNS.,"Where pine or oak might shield from heat, My thoughts turned piously to where Pierian pleasures one might meet, And pious converse jointly share. "
1068,PIOUS PIE POEM PUNS.,"Pyrometers were all at home-- No doubt the figures mounted high-- She sighed and said she could not roam, Then pitt (i) ed me with cherry pie. "
1069,PIOUS PIE POEM PUNS.,"Piacular may she not be, And thus escape the eternal pyre, No pirate's heart would dance with glee Like mine, to see that maid--Ex-Pier. "
1072,FIDELITY.,"Read at a Farmers' Picnic, Trinity Lake, Sept. 1, 1891. "
1073,FIDELITY.,"The Rippowams were a tribe of Indians living along the Sound near Stamford and Norwalk, Ct., and extended their territory for some miles northward. The Kitchewonks were a tribe living on the Hudson, near Sing Sing and Peekskill, N. Y., and found their way eastward. In the early days of the Indian occupation of these lands the Rippowams followed up the stream running from the three lakes--Round Pond, Middle Pond, and Lower Pond--while the Kitchewonks followed that branch of the Croton which finds its source in Cross Pond, now Lake Kitchewan. For the possession of these grounds there were frequent battles between these tribes, as the lake-land abounded in fish and game. The intercourse between these tribes, both belonging to the Mohegans, was very limited, at first, but in course of time became more frequent and friendly. A lime and marble ridge separates Lake Kitchewan from the three lower lakes and forms a watershed between the Hudson and the sound. "
1074,FIDELITY.,"In recent years a dam was constructed by the Stamford Water Co., and the three lakes were made into one, and very appropriately called thereafter, Trinity. The lakes are supplied almost entirely by springs, as no streams of any size empty into them. "
1075,FIDELITY.,"For several years, in the spring time, a floating island appeared in Trinity, upon which vegetation grew abundantly. This island sank upon the approach of cold weather and remained in a state of hibernation until the spring came. Some person or persons who had no love for the romantic, curious, and beautiful, loaded it so heavily with stones that it sank to rise no more. "
1076,FIDELITY.,In its departure the lake sustained the loss of an attraction which is known in but few lakes in the world. 
1077,FIDELITY.,"A large rock, estimated to weigh eight or ten tons, is so nicely poised upon another rook, upon a high point about fifty rods west of the lake, that a gentle pressure of the hand will cause it to rock perceptibly. "
1078,FIDELITY.,"Directly opposite the picnic grounds are precipitous rocks, below which the waters are extremely deep.--THE AUTHOR. "
1079,FIDELITY.,"When the infant world in its swaddling band Of mist and cloud and storm, Assumed its forms of sea and land, And the lakes and streams were born, In this western world, on the eastern shore, Four leagues from the inland sea, Came a liquid crown set with jewels four, But in union only three; For the northern gem was a solitaire And barred from the lesser three, By a marble wall wrought strong and fair By the hand of Divinity. "
1080,FIDELITY.,"A silver thread from the Trinity Ran southward through the wood, Till it lost its flow in the land-locked sea, And was merged in old Neptune's flood; But the northern gem in a mystic race Sent a message toward the west, And linked itself in the kind embrace Of the Hudson grandly dressed. "
1081,FIDELITY.,"Ten thousand moons had waxed and waned And flung on the mirror sheet A train of beauty, with no discord stained Since creation stood complete. Here antlered deer had slaked their thirst And fought their imaged form; Here rolling tones of thunder burst, As a harbinger of storm; Here song of bird and sigh of breeze Had ne'er met human ear; The beast on land, the fowl on trees Dwelt here in peace and knew no fear. "
1082,FIDELITY.,"Brave Kitchewonks had traced their way Along the stream that westward ran, While Rippowams pursued their prey Until this lake-land was their van. 'Twas here Mohegan met again The blood that in Mohegan flowed, But each regarded not the vein, Though kinsmen, foes they firmly stood. This lake-land, rich in fish and game, Was ground for strife and war and blood; From west and south the warriors came In battle paint and surly mood. The Kitchewonks near northern lake Upon the Rippowams looked down, And hoped their power and pride to break E'er harvest-moon had fully grown. "
1083,FIDELITY.,"ALMETA on the western stream Now mourned her absent PONOMO, For harvest-moon had sent its gleam Across the Hudson's tidal flow, And at its full he was to come, And her to lake-land safely guide, Where they should make their future home, And she should there become his bride. But he had with Rippowams' band, Marched forth to meet her kinsmen dear, And face to face they sternly stand Prepared for battle-storm severe. "
1084,FIDELITY.,"Her heart bid her to dare the shock And seek him near the hostile camp; Her mind her heart would basely mock, And boding fears her ardor damp; The bondage of her heart so great Her coward mind could never free; She heeds no danger, dares all fate, And this her brief soliloquy: "
1085,FIDELITY.,"""I know that tribal laws demand My life if I should thither flee, I must obey that great command-- God's higher law--fidelity. No other lips my lips have pressed, No other arms encircled me, Since he my maiden form caressed And each breathed vows of constancy. For me at each returning moon He journeyed through the forest wild, Braved dangers that my heart hath won, And now I must not be defiled By any doubt or any fear That death or suffering may bring. I'd count such sacrifice not dear If I must be an offering. "
1086,FIDELITY.,"""What though my blood may stain the soil, Devotion mark me for a slave Through weary years to strive and toil, Or fate should sink me 'neath the wave! 'Twere better far that such should be Than I should violate my heart And all that's sacred unto me By acting a base traitor's part. I must away, I must away To meet him by the silvery lake! 'Tis crime for me to longer stay I will not, cannot now forsake."" "
1087,FIDELITY.,"She speeds along the forest trail Where warriors late in painted form, Had marched through Kitchewan's fair vale To meet their foes in battle-storm. Her eyes are watchful to survey, Her ears detect the lightest sound, Her heart and mind to her betray Where barriers to her flight are found. She shuns them all by tact and skill; Most gladly she to him will prove The power that's in a woman's will, The faith that's in a woman's love. "
1088,FIDELITY.,"From hill and ledge she scans the ground While dangers seem her faith to mock; But highest point by her is found, She stands upon the swaying rock, Which seems unsteady 'neath her feet, And makes her doubt if she can stand To make inspection so complete, She may discern PONOMO'S band. The trembling rock and trembling heart Are firmly fixed, no power can move; But from its crest she must depart In search of him her heart doth love. She stands beside the central lake Along whose shores the war-whoop rang, And softly for her own heart's sake, This song of harvest-moon she sang: "
1089,FIDELITY.,"""The hunter's moon now floods the night Turns darkness into day, The wood and lake in mellow light, Charm grief and care away. "
1090,FIDELITY.,"""The sparkling water's silvery gleam My sorrow soothes for me, And lifts my soul in fancy's dream To thoughts so pure and free. "
1091,FIDELITY.,"""So bright the light that fills the night, The song-birds sweetly sing; From tree to tree they take their flight On swift yet noiseless wing. "
1092,FIDELITY.,"""Now come, PONOMO, come to me, I wait your coming here; You promised 'neath this hemlock tree, At midnight to appear. "
1093,FIDELITY.,"""My heart, my life, my all is yours, And you are all to me; Faith trusts your promise and assures Unchanged fidelity. "
1094,FIDELITY.,"""I know your heart is warm and true, Your love not cold or dumb, No earthly power can it subdue; I know that you will come."" "
1095,FIDELITY.,"She hears a footstep drawing near; Her voice is mute, her song is done, She waits, PONOMO to appear, In shadowed silence all alone. Beneath lugubrious hemlock shade Her heart beats with expectancy, And Kitchewonk's own dusky maid Trusts Rippowam's fidelity. He comes! She sees him near the lake; She knows his form, his step, his voice; No other charm for her could make Her heart and soul so much rejoice. "
1096,FIDELITY.,"They meet beside the water's edge Where hemlock boughs in silence nod, And there with mutual vow and pledge, In presence of their living God, They join the hand, the heart, the life, While harvest-moon a witness stood, That he the husband, she the wife, Should share in life's vicissitude. That sacred pledge was heard on high And written by an angel hand, Nor priest, nor king, nor majesty, Could marriage rites perform more grand. "
1097,FIDELITY.,"No tribal laws or priestly hand Can rivet adverse hearts in one; Compulsion has no iron band So strong it may not be undone; But ties of mutual interest That spring spontaneous from the soul, Are never by themselves oppressed, Their silken cords have full control. To know, to feel, to fully share The joys and sorrows of this life, Unites the souls of mated pair, And make the husband and the wife. "
1098,FIDELITY.,"PONOMO and ALMETA there, Where juts of rocks 'neath hemlock boughs, Had breathed a mutual, fervent prayer, And each to each pledged sacred vows, When o'er the lake the war-whoop rang, And Kitchewonks, on every side, Swept down with shout and yell and clang, Upon PONOMO and his bride. On north and south, and on the west, No way of flight then could they take, So from the rough rocks' rugged side They plunged into the central lake. "
1099,FIDELITY.,"A hundred arrows cleft the air, But one alone had reached its mark. PONOMO felt it roughly tear Its way into his faithful heart. He shrieked and sank beneath the wave, ALMETA followed after him; Their bridal couch was watery grave, The war-whoop was their requiem. "
1100,FIDELITY.,"The savage yell of victory Re-echoed then from shore to shore, While every rock and every tree Seemed deeply tinged with human gore, For when the moon from heavenly throne Looked down and saw the ghastly deed, It veiled itself and feebly shone, As if in agony to plead That human souls might ever know That God himself cannot approve The hand that strikes avenging blow, The soul devoid fraternal love. "
1101,FIDELITY.,"'Neath crystal waters of the lake, In silent, undisturbed repose, Where sounds of strife no slumbers break, Heedless alike of friends and foes, They slept the long, long sleep of death, Through centuries of rolling years, While o'er their forms the zephyrs' breath In playful eddyings oft appears. Their race has faded from the shore And left few traces that they were; The war-whoop now resounds no more, They bowed before White Conqueror. Full many a fathom 'neath the wave, Their forms have mouldered side by side, While shadowy hemlocks fringe the grave Of dark PONOMO and his bride. "
1102,FIDELITY.,"The waters then were deeper made Which gave their spirits much unrest, The lake their agony betrayed And seemed on every side distressed. One spring when Nature gaily dressed With charms that could the mind beguile, There rose upon the lake's fair breast A hibernating, floating isle. Devoid of life it seemed at first, Chaotic, dull, with beauty none, But rays of sunshine on it burst And changed it to a paragon. "
1103,FIDELITY.,"Two alders sprang from near its edge And twined in close embrace, While ferns and grass gave certain pledge That Time should give it smiling face. But when the frosts of autumn fell It sank from sight, perchance to rest; No searching mind could ever tell The secret of its rising crest. For years, at each returning spring, The isle would rise from 'neath the wave, As if to memory to bring PONOMO and ALMETA'S grave. But when the harvest-moon shone bright, It meekly sank; as years before When on that dread, but fatal night, The faithful sank by rock-bound shore. "
1104,FIDELITY.,"Its verdure grew, its alders spread, Its fame extended many a mile, 'Twas type of resurrected dead-- This hibernating, floating isle. "
1105,FIDELITY.,"But vandal hands destroyed the prize And sank it 'neath a weight of stones, While ALMETA sends forth her sighs, And PONOMO emits his groans. Here let them rest, if rest they may, Amid the beauteous scenes around, And wait in peace the final day, When at the angel's trumpet sound, The water shall give up its prey, The earth shall full surrender make, For heaven has not a type to-day, More perfect than this sky-blue lake. "
1107,FINIS.,"After our labor is finished, After the struggle is done, A restful surcease awaits us At the setting of life's sun. If when our toil seemed the sorest The heart refused to retreat From a grand and noble purpose, Till the vic'try was complete, Then shall joyous crown await us, Resplendent with jewels rare, And a radiance of honor The face shall benignly wear; Not that our works were all faultless And free from error and wrong, But because our sincere purpose Made us brave and true and strong. "
1108,FINIS.,"Results of labor thus rendered, Are safely trusted to Heaven, For He who knows ev'ry motive, Understands _why_ we have striven. If to man were given the balance To adjust with equity, His weakness and imperfection, His greed and his jealousy, Might sway the poise from adjustment, And his judgment go astray, Through the frailties of his nature-- Imperfect humanity "
1109,FINIS.,"The Infallible in knowledge, Whose true balance never swerves, Knows every man's Gethsemane, And the merit he deserves. He will not ask figs of the thorns; Of talents will not demand A greater increase than is just From a faithful steward's hand. Feeling the weight of the mission Incumbent upon our care; Searching the heart's deep recesses That vice may not shelter there; Working courageously onward The truth and right to defend; And asking a perfect guidance, We calmly welcome the end.
