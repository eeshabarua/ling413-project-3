10,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD. 
11,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"Dear Friends of our youth, should you happen to look At the curious things in this curious book, And should you, with quizzical countenance, ask The how and the why of our curious task-- We could truly reply To the query of ""why--"" To the smile on your lip, and your questioning eye, That the work was begun In a spirit of fun, To amuse when the work of the daylight was done; And continued, because we believed it would be Amusement to such as were weary as we To drift for awhile among goblins and elves, Or haply make shadows and rhymes for themselves. For though years have passed since we drifted apart, We're all of us more or less children at heart. And maybe yourselves and the youngsters 't will please To dwell for an hour with such creatures as these. "
14,TO OLD FRIENDS WITH YOUNG HEARTS AND YOUNG HEARTS GROWING OLD.,"Now, some one has said, in a moment of spleen, We cannot make pictures of what we've not seen; But such an assertion deserves only scorn, For the shape of the Gobolink never was born. He comes like the marvelous mimes of our dreams, When one has been supping on salads and creams, And curious changes of vision take place-- The horse may appear with an elephant face-- The goat with a cane, and the goose with a hat-- Six legs on the dog, and two tails on the cat; We never can tell, though we're sorely perplexed, What shape will be shown us, or what will come next; And these are the things that our Gobolinks do-- Dear friends, and dear children, we give them to you. "
18,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,Drop a little ink on a sheet of white paper. Fold the sheet in the center and press the ink-spots together with the fingers. All of the pictures in this book were made in this manner----none of them having been touched with a pen or brush. 
19,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"A great deal of practice will only go to show that the Gobolink, as his name implies, is a veritable goblin of the ink-bottle, and the way he eludes the artist's design proves him a self-made eccentric creature of a superior imagination. "
20,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"It is hardly to be expected that the animals and birds of prey referred to under more or less familiar names in the accompanying rhymes will be strikingly correct as to anatomy; and because, as upon page 15, the elephants, or whatever they may be, happen to have each a row of interesting tails continuing along the full length of the spinal column, no unkind criticism should be made upon the ability of the overworked and conscientious artists, who would have made fewer tails if they could, and have added nothing to the price of the book on account of undue liberality in the matter of caudal appendages. "
22,THE GOBOLINK AND HOW TO MAKE HIM.,"In fact the most unexpected and startling results will often occur--results grotesquely and strangely beautiful, well worthy of preservation. The authors of this book will be glad to receive a few examples of some of the more unusual Gobolinks or Shadow-Pictures that may occur to those interested in the amusement. They may be sent care of The Century Co. "
24,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Persons of all ages may obtain amusement out of Gobolinks, or Shadow-Pictures, as they are also called. "
26,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,The following is a very good method for playing the game: 
27,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Let three of the company be selected by the hostess as judges. To each of the others she then distributes from five to ten sheets of paper, from which they must produce at least one completed picture and rhyme in a given length of time, say five minutes, at the end of which the hostess rings a bell and the judges proceed at once to take up the pictures. These are then passed upon by them while the hostess is distributing a fresh round of paper, and the best two and the worst one are laid aside. "
28,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Those whose pictures have been selected now act as judges, surrendering their places at the tables to their predecessors, and another lot of pictures and rhymes are made. "
29,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"The game is continued in this manner until the hostess announces the arrival of the time for final judgment, or until a certain hour specified in the beginning. "
31,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"The three judges then in office now select one of the company as ""reader,"" and such person selected shall take up his position in strong light, and after reading the verses on each picture shall display it in full view of all present. It should then be pinned to a suspended sheet or screen where it may be easily examined by the company. "
32,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"This shall be continued until all the pictures selected by the judges have been so treated and displayed. The reader then acts as chairman, and the company proceed to vote on them for first, second, and booby prizes. "
33,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"The Gobolink receiving second largest number of votes for first prize is awarded second. The ballot for booby should be, of course, taken separately. Pictures should be signed or otherwise identified. "
35,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Where a number are making the pictures, it is well to seat them around a large table with the ink-supply in the center. "
36,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"Jet-black ink should be used, and a good quality of unglazed paper. The ink should not be too thin. "
37,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,The table should be protected from accident with several thicknesses of newspaper. 
38,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,A filled pen or tincture-dropper may be used for supplying the ink. 
39,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,"For a specially invited Gobolink party the company may dress in any grotesque fashion, remembering only that both sides of their costume shall be the same, this being a feature peculiar to Gobolink attire. "
40,THE GAME OF GOBOLINK.,No game could be more productive of amusement than Gobolink.

47,THE DRUM MAJOR,"A jolly little major of the drum, Behind him all the shadow people come, As he bravely leads the way For the Gobolink array With a bearing most important, and his uniform so gay; Oh, it's very plain to see that he's the hero of the day, This jolly little major of the drum. "
50,THE SOMETHINGS,"A Something met a Something In the mists of Shadowland. They ran against each other, And came quickly to a stand. "
51,THE SOMETHINGS,"""And who are you?"" said Something One. And Something Two, said he, ""That's just the very question that At once occurred to me."" "
54,THE BUBBLERS,"These boys have just returned from school, And now forget their troubles-- They both are sitting on a stool, And blowing crooked bubbles. "
57,THE JACK-O-MY-GOBLIN,"A terrible creature of Ink-bottle Land, A Jack-o-my-goblin is he. The sea-urchins made him to place on the sand, And frighten the monsters that dwell on the land. They took a sea-pumpkin and carved it by hand, And lighted it up in their glee With a phosphorus fish from the sea; Now all the day long on the shore doth he stand, While Land-loodles terrified flee, Oh, yes, The terrified Land-loodles flee. "
60,THE FRIENDLY CHICKENS,"These chicks have been out in all weathers, They have little to show but pin-feathers; But their friendship is strong, And they sing us a song Regardless of wherefores or whethers. "
63,THEY STAYED AT HOME,"These chickens long debated On a costume for a ball, And became so much elated That they didn't go at all. "
66,THE UNFRIENDLY CHICKENS,"The saucy chicks which here you see Know neither wrong nor right-- They can't be good like you and me, Who sometimes really do agree-- So all day long they fight. "
69,THE BUTTERFLY,How gaily flits the Butterfly Across the seas of clover. How blue the arching summer sky That hangs the country over. 
70,THE BUTTERFLY,"On wings of purple, brown, and gold He drifts across the meadow. His harmless flight you may behold From Yucatan to Yeddo. "
73,DIPSEY DOODLE..,"This is little Dipsey Doodle, Sometimes called the great Kioodle. "
76,HIS RELATIVE,This is Dipsey Doodle's brother-- They have ears like one another. 
79,A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE,"Two Widgelums went for a walk one day By the shores of a shimmering sea; And one of them said to the other, ""I pray, Now what's your opinion of me?"" "
80,A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE,"Then the Widgelum looked at his widgelous mate: ""My charming companion,"" said he, ""The things that I think I am loath to relate, You look so exactly like me."" "
83,THE MASK,Here is a curious mask-- I don't know of whom or of what-- I've never had courage to ask; A saint's I am sure it is not. 
86,HUMAN NATURE?,"Two rival Woojums did declare That they must surely sever, But lo! that day, they found that they Were better friends than ever. "
89,RED RIDING-HOOD'S WOLF,"Oh, this is the wolf that Red Riding-hood found When she came to her grandmother's bed, Her ears were so long and her eyes big and round, While her voice had a strange and a terrible sound When she answered what Riding-hood said, For alas, the grandmother was dead. And Little Red Riding-hood sprang with a bound Through the doorway and hastily fled, Oh, my, In terror she hastily fled. "
92,WITCH BROTH,"Witches, witches in a tree, Brew your broth of mystery. Snail and toad and lizard in it-- Tail of cat and tongue of linnet, Rabbit's foot and wing of bee-- Witches, witches, none for me. "
95,JUST LIKE OTHER CHILDREN,"Two little Gobolinks one day Were sent to do the dishes, Instead of which they ran away And fished for shadow-fishes. "
96,JUST LIKE OTHER CHILDREN,"They fished and fished and fished and fished, And but a leaf they caught, O, And then they wished and wished and wished They'd done the thing they ought to. "
97,JUST LIKE OTHER CHILDREN,"So, by and by they homeward crept With plumage drooping sadly, And there they bowed their heads and wept Because they felt so badly. "
101,A SEA-DANCE,"Two beautiful sponges one day Joined hands with a haughty sting-ray, And away danced the three Through the depths of the sea In a most irresponsible way. "
104,THE SINGERS,"These ducks have voices sweet to hear, And frequently before us They stretch their mouths from ear to ear, And sing to us in chorus. "
107,THE BIRDS AND THE WIRE,"Upon the quivering wire, As hearkening to a lyre, The sparrows gather at the break of day. Perhaps that vibrant string Is tuned that they may sing An anthem to the glories of the May. "
110,A HARD QUESTION,"Here are two pairs of funny beasts, I hardly know their habits-- Perhaps they may be elephants-- Perhaps they may be rabbits. "
111,A HARD QUESTION,"In conversation they appear Withdrawn from one another, As if attempting to decide What name to give the other. "
114,THE MOON DANCE,"Two shadow-colts one summer night did try To dance a jig because the moon was high: But the moon obscured its face, For she thought 't was a disgrace. While the little stars were laughing in the sky. "
117,PREHISTORIC ANIMALS,"Many creatures such as these, Ere the dawn of history, On the land, and in the seas Manufactured mystery. "
118,PREHISTORIC ANIMALS,"Mystery for mighty men Who, like Doctor Dry-bone Bring them into form again From a scale or thigh-bone. "
121,THE GRACEFUL POLLY-WOGS,"Oh, the polly-wog waltzes with wonderful grace, And he skates with a radiant smile on his face, While his arm in the air Has the curve, I declare, Of some beautiful creature's of Thrace. "
124,A SOUTH-SEA IDOL,"There lives an old god in the isles of the West, And a wonderful god is he, With a star on his brow, and a star on his breast, While at left and at right, In their armor drest, A dragon and knight On his shoulders rest, And he dwells in the great South Sea. "
127,PREPARING FOR WINTER,"These squirrels have paused to consider The fact that 't is late in the fall, And time to lay nuts up for winter If they would have any at all. "
128,PREPARING FOR WINTER,"The red squirrel hoards like a miser, But, alas, the improvident gray, He's only a pauper of winter Who scampers the summer away. "
131,THE BATHERS,"Adown the beach at Rockaway, Three bathers one hot summer day Retired to while the hours away. "

138,BROTHERLY CONSOLATION,"A Thingamy-bob Got out of a job, And went to consult with his brother: Said his brother to him, ""Your chances are slim Unless you go hunt up another."" "
141,THE BUTTERFLY MAN,"A very gay fellow was he-- As gay as a mortal could be. And he fluttered about Till at last he turned out A Butterfly man, as you see. "
144,THE TRANSFERRED SMILE,"Two little snails did smile and smile, The summer day beguiling. Two birds espied them from afar, And now the birds are smiling. "

153,THE GARGOYLE,A gargoyle here you see. I've heard it said that he Was found in France By strangest chance-- But what is that to me? 
154,THE GARGOYLE,"I only know that we Discovered him to be An imp of ink; And so I think He's ours, as you'll agree. "
157,THE ELF PARTY,"These four little two-horned elves Are seated on coraline shelves. The spot where they be Is down under the sea, And they've got the whole reef to themselves. "
160,UNPLEASANT COMPANIONS,"Here are two Wriggles from Wriggelum-town-- Their legs are sky-blue and their bodies are brown; Their tails are a wonderful changeable hue; I don't care to have them for playmates, do you? "
163,THE GRENADIER,"A soldierly fellow is he, With swords as erect as can be. His attendants are queer, And so small, they appear To barely reach up to his knee. "
166,KINGS' JESTERS,"Jesters from the courts of kings Tell their secret whisperings. Just a fleeting moment, then They must hurry back again. Ever making monarchs gay, Happy-hearted jesters they. "
169,THE FUNNY OCTOPUS,"A jolly old octopus lived in the sea, With a hey-diddle hi-diddle dum; And the funniest sort of a fellow was he, This jolly old octopus under the sea, With a mouth where the top of his head ought to be, To swallow the divers that come-- This jolly old octopus under the sea, With a hey-diddle hi-diddle dum. "
172,THE NYMPHS AND THE OSTRICHES,Two pious little nymphs are kneeling here-- Two double-headed ostriches above them; And on their backs two gallant knights appear-- Perhaps they'll see the little nymphs and love them.

178,ENTOMOLOGY,"These are some insects that dwell in the grass And nip at the gobolinks' toes as they pass. Their legs are uneven, their bodies are queer. Their habits are very uncertain, I fear. "
181,FOX AND GEESE,"Two foxes stole two geese one night, When the air was warm and the moon was bright: One started west--one started east-- Their hearts intent on a glorious feast. But alas! for the things that we hope to do! A funny old man, with pistols two, Came running out, where the moon was bright, And they dropped their plunder and took to flight. "
184,THE TAIL OF TADDY POLE,"There was a little Polliwog-- His name was Taddy Pole. He lived within a little bog, Beside a crawfish hole. "

198,THE PUGILISTS,"The pugilistic craze is such That e'en the gobolinks absorb it. These pictures don't amount to much, But they were made for Fitz and Corbett. "

204,GOBOLINK HORSES,"These are the steeds that the gobolinks use; They love them and pet them and never abuse. Their backs are not pleasant to sit on, they say, So they ride them erect in the hippodrome way. "
207,MISS F.M. DE LISLE,"This is a damsel who dresses in style. Her name is Miss Fannie Magruder De Lisle. She loves to look pretty--as most of us do-- That's why she's so stylish, and dignified, too. "
210,FANNIE'S CURLING-TONGS,"These are the irons with which Fannie crimps Her fair auburn tresses whenever she primps. She curls and arranges her locks with great care, Because she is proud of her radiant hair. "
213,THE BEARS AND THE HARLEQUINS.,"Gay harlequins dancing--beribboned are they And carry two poles in the air; That rest on their heads in a curious way, And top of each pole is a bear, I declare, A wonderful, long-tailed bear. "

228,THE SHEET-AND-PILLOW PARTY,"A pillow-case party the Gobolinks gave, And it proved a right merry carouse: But I'm sure you'd have laughed at their attitudes grave As they made their ridiculous bows. "

237,THE MERRY WATER-WEEDLES,"Within the caverns of the sea Two Water-weedles stay. Their hearts are happy as can be, Within the caverns of the sea They sing and frolic in their glee Throughout the livelong day. Within the caverns of the sea Two water-weedles stay. "
240,A NARROW ESCAPE,"Two piggies went to market All on a market day, But when the butcher caught them They wished they'd stayed away. "

244,THE CAPTIVES,"Pray tell us, if you please, What sort of things are these: A shadow-ghost has captured them, And holds them fast with ease. "
247,THE VICIOUS GOLLY-POPS,"Here are two Golly-pops Looking for lollypops Such as grow under the sea. Their ways are ambitious, Their faces are vicious. I'm glad they're not looking for me. "
250,THE DIVERS,"Two divers, one sweet summer day, Went down into the ocean, They saw the fishes all at play, The sea-flowers all in motion. "
251,THE DIVERS,"They danced a jig and sang a song, And gathered water-roses, When, lo, two lobsters came along, And bit them on their toeses. "
254,THE SHADOW-HARP,"This is the harp of which nobody sings-- Where is the keyboard and where are the strings? The strings are undone and the keys thrown away, For this is the harp on which shadow-folk play. "
257,A GLAD RETURN,"Two little maids just home from school Have been so long asunder-- They first embrace, then face to face They stand and look and wonder. "
260,GROTESQUES,Very funny creatures these-- Can't tell what they are. Men or birds or beasts or bees-- Very funny creatures these-- Turn them either way you please-- View them near or far. Very funny creatures these-- Can't tell what they are. 
264,SHADOW-CRESTS,"These are designs of heraldry That shadow-folk affect, Though some are no less shadowy Than those that men select. "
265,SHADOW-CRESTS,"For many men have bought a crest Although they come quite dear, And such of those as can't invest May find an emblem here. "
271,A FRONTIER COAT-OF-ARMS,"This is a crest That came out of the West, For the family was founded Where hunters abounded, So the head of a deer And two hunters appear. "
274,THE FANCIFUL ELK,"This is the head of an elk, as you see. His horns are as tall as a sycamore tree. They are strangely designed, And I think you will find He has horns where his ears ought to be. "
277,T' OTHER AND WHICH,"Ink-bottle imps turn up their noses When they meet each other: And the reason, I suppose, is-- Can't tell which from t' other. "
281,CATHODES,"And here we have a lot of things Defying nomenclature. The bones of Gobolinks are they, Revealing in the cathode ray Their anatomic nature. "
286,IN THE X-RAY,"Cathode fairy, Light and airy, Sunny weather, Two together, Caring nothing why or whether Flesh or blood or bone or feather Shows on such a summer day 'Neath the Cathode's magic ray. "
289,A BEETLEVILLE DANCE,"The beetles gave a party, And all their friends were there. The welcome was so hearty To join the beetles' party, The Joodle and the Jarty Came flying through the air. Oh, the beetles gave a party, And all their friends were there. "
292,QUEEN BEETLE,"A Lady queen of Beetle-land-- Attendants small on either hand. They walk or fly with equal skill-- They fetch and carry at her will. I'm glad, I'm sure, that we have seen The beetles and their lady queen. "
296,BEETLES,This is a beetle that came from Metuchen-- The plan of his house is likewise his escutcheon. 
299,KING BEETLE,"Oh, a marvelous mind has the old beetle king, And he rules in a marvelous way; For he rolls up his eyes and commences to sing When his subjects go glittering by on the wing; And 'tis said that his notes have a powerful ring When he chants at the breaking of day-- They say-- His anthem at breaking of day. "
302,OUR PET,The head of a Gobolink tiger-- With smellers arranged as you see He used to reside on the Niger; But now he is living with me. 
305,GOOD BREEDING,"Most Shadow-people are polite. And bow whene'er they meet; For us to do the same is right, At home or in the street. "
308,THE WASHERWOMEN,"There were some old ladies of Dundee Who did all their washing on Mondee. Then they shook out their clothes Till they dried, I suppose, To have them all ready for Sundee. "
311,A MARINE BALL,"Two lobsters and two sea-horses One day came out of the wet; They heard a mermaid sing her song, And danced a minuet. "
314,THE QUEER MOLLUSKS,"Ridiculous mollusks are we, And dwell in the depths of the sea. Our bodies are jelly, And we haven't a belly In the place where our bellies should be. "
318,SEAWEEDS,Within the garden of the sea Are gems of beauty rare-- The Star-wort and Anemone And Ocean pinks are there. 
319,SEAWEEDS,"Oh, these are dainty things indeed The Mermaids keep in store; But fairer still, to me, the weed That decks the ocean's floor. "
320,SEAWEEDS,"Whatever flower of earth we win, Howe'er so fair it be, 'T will not surpass those weeds within The garden of the sea. "
321,SEAWEEDS,[Footnote A: Names given are in use only in Gobolink-land.] 
333,FINIS,"There was a gay Gobolink known as Maginnis, But now he is dead and we use him for Finis; Or, if you prefer to pronounce it Fin-nee, We'll say that this Gobolink's name was Magee. "
