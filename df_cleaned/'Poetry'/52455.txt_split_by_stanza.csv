101,II,"I know not. This I know, I have not trod "
110,II,"""Chi non pu√¥ quel che vuol, quel che puo voglia; "
128,II,"Down to the plains where men are wont to toil, "
143,II,"Next I would make me wings, and I would fly "
146,II,To seek out where God walks and whom He loves. 
147,II,"I made me wings, but had not strength to fly. "
178,II,He does his work as though it were his play; 
212,II,And now I'm painting Mona Lisa's face . . . 
240,II,"Who haunt my brain, has held me back from love. "
241,II,This . . . this was so till Mona Lisa came. 
245,II,And smiled to see me strive to catch her smile 
262,II,Since white's the flower which most of all she loves. 
299,II,"No . . . no, the moon shines through and makes "
307,II,"But hastens on as if he . . . there, he's gone. "
316,II,I'll think of Mona Lisa's face alone . . . 
323,II,"And seen my flower, but feared to break its stem. "
336,II,"And, when I paint her face, I paint my own. "
340,II,He would not have His plans jerked out of joint 
345,II,"That he, in words I loved, might tell me so. "

391,II,"And I to her am Death, Birth, Love and Fate; "
404,II,"And this we burn, that each life hath its end; "

457,II,"That since you could not paint her in her life, "
460,II,"You did not know? . . . _Why, she's been dead "

550,BELLUM AMORIS,Life which is war at the end of Love's War. 
553,BELLUM AMORIS,When they rode out from the East and the West. 
584,A BRAVE LIFE,"And we, who watched his face and heard his voice, "
589,A BRAVE LIFE,"A path for us; if one should fall, he stayed "
624,TO A YOUNG GIRL WHO SAID SHE WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL,TO A YOUNG GIRL WHO SAID SHE WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL 
626,TO A YOUNG GIRL WHO SAID SHE WAS NOT BEAUTIFUL,Nor the way she walks with her head held high; 
729,UNSEEN,"You would see me walk beside you, if your eyes "
745,UNSEEN,"But my arms are warm about her, could her eyes "
825,CHILDISH TRAVELLING,"Where you will go, and what land will be best "
831,CHILDISH TRAVELLING,"I can but love you and kiss your gold hair, "
888,SPRING,Till her babe is bom she shall find no rest. 
956,_A ROMANCE_,And his life gave out for his love of her. 
971,_A ROMANCE_,When he cursed her face in his hate of her. 
999,_A ROMANCE_,"There he made great stir and called out his men, "
1275,_A ROMANCE_,"Love is more than life ... far more, far more."" "
1511,HOME,"For some of us our lives may not go well: 'Gainst such small perils courage will be proof, 'Gainst stronger ills these memories may be proof; "
1514,HOME,What though we dwell not then as now we dwell? 
1553,TO ENGLAND'S GREATEST SATIRIST,"Lest one, from all our world, should read thee right "

""In a note in his biography, Scott says that his friend, Doctor Tuke of Dublin, has a lock of Stella's hair, enclosed in a paper by Swift, on which are written, in the Dean's hand, the words: 'Only a woman's hair.' An instance, says Scott, of the Dean's desire to veil his feelings under the mask of cynical indifference.""--Thackeray in his Essay on Dean Swift._] "
1591,TO ENGLAND'S GREATEST SATIRIST,"But all is vague. Faint, like a far off strain, "
1597,TO ENGLAND'S GREATEST SATIRIST,"How in a week from life to death you grew, "
1632,TO ENGLAND'S GREATEST SATIRIST,"Then you fell sick and, while I held your hand, "
1708,IF GOD SHOULD COME,"If so you say, when you have seen the pain "
1777,ANSWERED PRAYER,"But whenever the wind is blowing, 'Tis then that I find him best; "
1802,IN BEDLAM,"Which, for my sake, have come to life this day. "
1833,IN BEDLAM,"When that shall be, I'll paint my walls with gold, "
1837,IN BEDLAM,"Lord, I am mad; but Thou canst heal my mind. "
1852,IN BEDLAM,"Then craned I forth my hands to dutch Thy winds, "
1864,IN BEDLAM,"Did love, and love, and love till his heart brake; "
1900,A SONG OF IGNOBLE EASE,"Then did I ask, ""What now is left to say? "
1904,A SONG OF IGNOBLE EASE,"Thus was Man made, and there is naught to say."" "
1905,A SONG OF IGNOBLE EASE,"Oh, I was weak, and blind with too much pain, "
1908,A SONG OF IGNOBLE EASE,"Find love to rid me of this too much pain."" "
1909,A SONG OF IGNOBLE EASE,"I spoke in fear, and knew not what I said, "
1913,A SONG OF IGNOBLE EASE,"Then did One come who laid His hands in mine, "
2016,MASTERLESS,"Who, when the clouds fly far, can calm the wave "
2089,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,"""_The Terror by Night: the Arrow by Day: the Pestilence walking in Darkness: the Destruction wasting at Noonday._"" "
2102,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,What things men fear they do not dare to say 
2104,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,But run on them and wreak those ills they dread: 
2105,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,"To Death we kneel, to God we bow the head; "
2107,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,"We fear our fears, but thee, Oh Fear, we hate, "
2112,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,"Ah, were this all, our lives might yet go well "
2141,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,"Ah, were we wise, our lives 'tis thus we'd spend: "
2170,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,"Speak, but this once, to tell us who thou art; "
2177,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,"But watch, aye watch, and know us all in all. "
2178,FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD,"Oh, can it be, that thou art but the call "
2188,ABANDON,"I grasp my life and hurl it with the rest, "
2309,I'M SORRY,"And the skies dance not, shall have naught to say, "
2324,DREAMLAND LOVE,"We had no stars to shine our curved prows hither, "
2329,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Too full of splendour to last so long as we, "
2331,DREAMLAND LOVE,"Once to see space, and then to cease to be. "
2334,DREAMLAND LOVE,"You in Sleep's arms, of whom you are the daughter, "
2355,DREAMLAND LOVE,"These axe the souls who watch us at our dreaming, "
2357,DREAMLAND LOVE,"All, all is hushed, save your gray eyes deep gleaming, "
