458,"SIR,",it was a special favour when you lately bestowed upon me here the first
459,"SIR,",taste of your acquaintance though no longer than to make me know that i
460,"SIR,",wanted more time to value it and to enjoy it rightly and in truth if
461,"SIR,",i could then have imagined your farther stay in these parts which i
462,"SIR,",understood afterwards by mr h i would have been bold in our vulgar
463,"SIR,",phrase to mend my draught for you left me with an extreme thirst and
464,"SIR,",to have begged your conversation again jointly with your said learned
465,"SIR,",friend at a poor meal or two that we might have banded together some
466,"SIR,",good authors of the antient time among which i observed you to have
469,"SIR,",since your going you have charged me with new obligations both for a
470,"SIR,",very kind letter from you dated the sixth of this month and for a
471,"SIR,",dainty piece of entertainment which came therewith wherein i should
472,"SIR,",much commend the tragical part if the lyrical did not ravish me with a
473,"SIR,",certain doric delicacy in your songs and odes whereunto i must plainly
474,"SIR,",confess to have seen yet nothing parallel in our language _ipsa
475,"SIR,",mollities_19a but i must not omit to tell you that i now only owe
476,"SIR,",you thanks for intimating unto me how modestly soever the true
477,"SIR,",artificer for the work itself i had viewed some good while before with
478,"SIR,",singular delight having received it from our common friend mr r in
479,"SIR,",the very close of the late rs poems printed at oxford whereunto it
480,"SIR,",is added as i now suppose that the accessory might help out the
481,"SIR,",principal according to the art of stationers and to leave the reader
484,"SIR,",now sir concerning your travels wherein i may challenge a little more
485,"SIR,",privilege of discourse with you i suppose you will not blanch20b
486,"SIR,",paris in your way therefore i have been bold to trouble you with a few
487,"SIR,",lines to mr m b whom you shall easily find attending the young lord
488,"SIR,",s as his governor and you may surely receive from him good directions
489,"SIR,",for shaping of your farther journey into italy where he did reside by
490,"SIR,",my choice some time for the king after mine own recess from venice
492,"SIR,",i should think that your best line will be through the whole length of
493,"SIR,",france to marseilles and thence by sea to genoa whence the passage
494,"SIR,",into tuscany is as diurnal as a gravesend barge i hasten as you do to
495,"SIR,",florence or siena the rather to tell you a short story from the
498,"SIR,",at siena i was tabled in the house of one alberto scipione an old roman
499,"SIR,",courtier in dangerous times having been steward to the duca di
500,"SIR,",pagliano who with all his family were strangled save this only man
501,"SIR,",that escaped by foresight of the tempest with him i had often much chat
502,"SIR,",of those affairs into which he took pleasure to look back from his
503,"SIR,",native harbour and at my departure toward rome which had been the
504,"SIR,",centre of his experience i had won confidence enough to beg his advice
505,"SIR,",how i might carry myself securely there without offence of others or
506,"SIR,",of mine own conscience _signor arrigo mio_ says he _i pensieri
507,"SIR,",stretti ed il viso sciolto_21a will go safely over the whole world

557,"MY LORD,",this poem which received its first occasion of birth from yourself and
558,"MY LORD,",others of your noble family and much honour from your own person in the
559,"MY LORD,",performance now returns again to make a final dedication of itself to
560,"MY LORD,",you although not openly acknowledged by the author yet it is a
561,"MY LORD,",legitimate offspring so lovely and so much desired that the often
562,"MY LORD,",copying of it hath tired my pen to give my several friends satisfaction
563,"MY LORD,",and brought me to a necessity of producing it to the public view and
564,"MY LORD,",now to offer it up in all rightful devotion to those fair hopes and
565,"MY LORD,",rare endowments of your muchpromising youth which give a full
566,"MY LORD,",assurance to all that know you of a future excellence live sweet

641,COMUS.,and all this tract that fronts the falling sun                    30
677,COMUS.,to quench the drouth of phoebus which as they taste
693,COMUS.,as now i do but first i must put off
698,COMUS.,well knows to still the wild winds when they roar
705,COMUS.,_comus enters with a charmingrod in one hand his glass in the other
706,COMUS.,with him a rout of monsters headed like sundry sorts of wild beasts
707,COMUS.,but otherwise like men and women their apparel glistering they come in
708,COMUS.,making a riotous and unruly noise with torches in their hands_
754,COMUS.,of all thy dues be done and none left out
769,COMUS.,be well stocked with as fair a herd as grazed
790,COMUS.,_lady_ this way the noise was if mine ear be true
811,COMUS.,but where they are and why they came not back
821,COMUS.,this is the place as well as i may guess
837,COMUS.,that he the supreme good to whom all things ill
847,COMUS.,such noise as i can make to be heard farthest
894,COMUS.,to touch the prosperous growth of this tall wood                270

913,COMUS.,_lady_ to seek i the valley some cool friendly spring
925,COMUS.,_lady_ no less than if i should my brothers lose
931,COMUS.,_comus_ two such i saw what time the laboured ox
942,COMUS.,and as i passed i worshiped if those you seek
975,COMUS.,i cannot be that i should fear to change it

1025,COMUS.,not being in danger as i trust she is not                     370
1038,COMUS.,but he that hides a dark soul and foul thoughts
1047,COMUS.,for who would rob a hermit of his weeds                         390
1057,COMUS.,and tell me it is safe as bid me hope                           400
1069,COMUS.,yet where an equal poise of hope and fear                       410
1080,COMUS.,_elder brother_ i mean that too but yet a hidden strength
1081,COMUS.,which if heaven gave it may be termed her own

1242,COMUS.,still to be so displaced i was all ear                         560
1252,COMUS.,till guided by mine ear i found the place                      570
1260,COMUS.,ye were the two she meant with that i sprung
1285,COMUS.,and earths base built on stubble but come lets on

1407,COMUS.,but such as are good men can give good things
1425,COMUS.,to store her children with if all the world                     720
1435,COMUS.,the earth cumbered and the winged air darked with plumes       730
1455,COMUS.,and cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply                      750
