11,INTRODUCTION,"On me demande, pour ce charmant volume, un mot de préface en français; le voici: "
12,INTRODUCTION,"Quand, en 1863, je publiai mon premier recueil de poésies--écrites au collège, pour la plupart,--le grand poète américain Longfellow eut la flatteuse bienveillance de m'appeler _The pathfinder of a new land of song_. "
13,INTRODUCTION,"Avec mille fois plus de raison puis-je aujourd'hui passer le compliment à mon sympathique confrère et ami, l'auteur de ce livre; car, si jamais quelqu'un, chez nous, a mérité le titre de _pathfinder of a new land of song_, c'est assurément lui. "
14,INTRODUCTION,"Non seulement il a découvert le champ, la clairière, la vallée fertile et encore inexplorée; il en a fait l'exploitation à sa manière, avec des outils et des moyens de son invention; et, fier de sa conquête, il laisse, de son épaule robuste, tomber à nos pieds le fruit de son travail, la gerbe plantureuse aux ors vierges, à l'arôme sauvage, aux savoureuses promesses, toute fraîche et toute crissante dans sa rusticité saine. "
15,INTRODUCTION,"N'est-elle pas, en effet, d'une originalité peu commune, l'idée de prendre un pauvre illettré, de le présenter comme un type national à part, de lui mettre aux lèvres une langue qui n'est pas la sienne et qu'il ne connaît qu' à demi; d'en faire en même temps un personnage bon, doux, aimable, honnête, intelligent et droit, l'esprit en éveil, le coeur plein d'une poésie native stimulant son patriotisme, jetant un rayon lumineux dans son modeste intérieur, berçant ses heures rêveuses de souvenirs lointains et mélancoliques? "
16,INTRODUCTION,"Et cela sans que jamais, dans ce portrait d'un nouveau genre, le plus subtil des critiques puisse surprendre nulle part le coup de crayon de la caricature! "
17,INTRODUCTION,"Dans ses inimitables contes villageois, George Sand a peint les paysans du Berry sous des dehors très intéressants. Elle nous les montre même d'un sentiment très affiné dans leur simplicité naïve et leur cordiale bonhomie. En somme, elle en fait des natures, des tempéraments, quelque chose de typique, en même temps qu' harmonieux de teinte et de forme. "
18,INTRODUCTION,"Mais George Sand faisait parler ses personnages dans la langue du pays, dans la langue de la chaumière, dans leur propre dialecte, enfin. Elle n'avait, pour ainsi dire, qu' à faire pénétrer le souffle de son talent sous le réseau de la phrase, pour animer celle-ci d'un reflet de lyrisme ou d'une vibration attendrie. "
19,INTRODUCTION,La tâche abordée par M. Drummond présentait un caractère beaucoup plus difficile. 
20,INTRODUCTION,"Ici, le poète avait bien, il est vrai, le milieu à saisir, placé, droit en face de son objectif. Il était assez familier avec ses acteurs pour les grouper avantageusement, en ménageant les effets d'ombres et de lumière. Il est naturellement assez artiste pour ne rien négliger de ce qui ajoute du pittoresque à la pose; surtout, il connaissait à fond le type à reproduire, ses moeurs, ses passions, ses sentiments, ses penchants, ses superstitions et ses faiblesses. "
21,INTRODUCTION,"Mais comment, sans tomber dans la charge ou la bouffonnerie, faire parler systématiquement à ses personnages une langue étrangère, forcément incorrecte dans la bouche de quelqu'un qui l'a apprise par oreille, sans savoir lire même dans sa propre langue? "
22,INTRODUCTION,La tentative était hardie; mais on sait que le succès a un faible pour les audacieux. 
23,INTRODUCTION,"Dans son étude des Canadiens-français, M. Drummond a trouvé le moyen d'éviter un écueil qui aurait semblé inévitable pour tout autre que pour lui. Il est resté vrai, sans tomber dans la vulgarité, et piquant sans verser dans le grotesque. "
24,INTRODUCTION,"Qu'il mette en scène le gros fermier fier de son bien ou de ses filles à marier, le vieux médecin de campagne ne comptant plus ses états de service, le jeune amoureux qui rêve au clair de la lune, le vieillard qui repasse en sa mémoire la longue suite des jours révolus, le conteur de légendes, l'aventurier des ""pays d'en haut,"" et même le Canadien exilé--le _Canadien errant_, comme dit la chanson populaire--qui croit toujours entendre résonner à son oreille le vague tintement des cloches de son village; que le récit soit plaisant ou pathétique, jamais la note ne sonne faux, jamais la bizarrerie ne dégénère en puérilité burlesque. "
25,INTRODUCTION,"C'est là un tour de force comme il ne s'en fait pas souvent, et c'est avec enthousiasme que je tends la main à M. Drummond pour le féliciter de l'avoir accompli. "
26,INTRODUCTION,Il a véritablement fait là oeuvre de poète et d'artiste. 
27,INTRODUCTION,"J'ajouterai qu'il a fait aussi oeuvre de bon citoyen. Car le jour sous lequel il présente mes compatriotes illettrés ne peut manquer de valoir à ceux-ci--et partant à tout le reste de la nationalité--un accroissement désirable dans l'estime de nos compatriotes de langue anglaise, qui n'ont pas été à même de les étudier d'aussi près que M. Drummond. "
28,INTRODUCTION,La peinture qu'en fait le poète est on ne peut plus sympathique et juste; et de semblables procédés ne peuvent que cimenter l'union de coeur et d'esprit qui doit exister entre toutes les fractions qui composent la grande famille canadienne appelée à vivre et à prospérer sous la même loi et le même drapeau. 
29,INTRODUCTION,"En lisant les vers de M. Drummond, le Canadien-français sent que c'est là l'expression d'une âme amie; et, à ce compte, je dois à l'auteur plus que mes bravos, je lui dois en même temps un chaleureux merci. "
33,PREFACE,"In presenting to the public ""The Habitant and other French-Canadian Poems,"" I feel that my friends who are already, more or less, familiar with the work, understand that I have not written the verses as examples of a dialect, or with any thought of ridicule. "
34,PREFACE,"Having lived, practically, all my life, side by side with the French-Canadian people, I have grown to admire and love them, and I have felt that while many of the English-speaking public know perhaps as well as myself the French-Canadian of the cities, yet they have had little opportunity of becoming acquainted with the habitant, therefore I have endeavored to paint a few types, and in doing this, it has seemed to me that I could best attain the object in view by having my friends tell their own tales in their own way, as they would relate them to English-speaking auditors not conversant with the French tongue. "
35,PREFACE,"My good friend, Dr. Louis Frechette, Poet Laureate, has as a French-Canadian, kindly written an ""Introductory"" in his own graceful language, and I have to thank him above all for his recognition of the spirit which has actuated me in writing ""dialect"" verse. "
36,PREFACE,"To Mr. F. S. Coburn, the artist, also, I am deeply indebted for the faithful manner in which he has interpreted the different characters and scenes contained in this volume. All the pictures have been sketched from nature or life, and the keenest critic will agree with me, that Mr. Coburn's illustrations are most typical, both of the people and the soil. "

228,"A STORY OF THE ""CHASSE GALLERIE.""","In the days of the ""Old Regime"" in Canada, the free life of the woods and prairies proved too tempting for the young men, who frequently deserted civilization for the savage delights of the wilderness. These voyageurs and coureurs de bois seldom returned in the flesh, but on every New Year's Eve, back thro' snowstorm and hurricane--in mid-air--came their spirits in ghostly canoes, to join, for a brief spell, the old folks at home and kiss the girls, on the annual feast of the ""Jour de l'an,"" or New Year's Day. The legend which still survives in French-speaking Canada, is known as ""La Chasse Gallerie."" "
