5,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"There lies a wold in Vester Haf, There builds a boor his hold; And thither he carries hawk and hound, He'll stay through winter's cold. "
6,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He takes with him both hound and cock, He means there long to stay; The wild deer in the wood that are For his arrival pay. "
7,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He hews the oak and poplar tall, He fells the good beech tree; Then fill'd was the laidly Trold with spite That he should make so free. "
8,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He hews him posts, he hews him balks, He early toils and late; Out spake the Trolds within the hill: ""Who knocks at such a rate?"" "
9,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then up and spake the youngest Trold, As emmet small to view: ""O here is come a Christian man, But verily he shall rue."" "
10,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Upstood the smallest of the Trolds, And round he roll'd his eyes: ""O we will hie to the yeoman's house, And o'er him hold assize. "
11,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""He hews away our sheltering wood, Meanwhile shall we be tame? No! I from him his wife will take, And make him suffer shame."" "
12,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"All the Trolds in the hill that were Wild for the fray upbound; They hie away to the yeoman's house, Their tails all curling round. "
13,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Seven and a hundred were the Trolds, Their laidliness was great; To the yeoman's house they'll go as guests, With him to drink and eat. "
14,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"The hound is yelling in the yard, The herdsman blows his horn; Crows the cock and clucks the hen As the yeoman throws them corn. "
15,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Of Villenskov the yeoman saw The Trolds the window through: ""Now help me Jesu, Mary's son, Those trolds have me in view."" "
16,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He sign'd the cross in every nook, But mostly in his room; Some of the Trolds in fright thereat Flew to the forest's gloom. "
17,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Some flew east, and some flew west, And some flew north away; And others flew to the valleys deep, Where still, I trow, they stay. "
18,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"But ah! the smallest of the Trolds Bold enter'd at the door; For crossing he refus'd to flee, Was bent on mischief sore. "
19,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"The housewife thought of a good device, She plac'd him at the board, And before him set both ale and meat, With many a courteous word. "
20,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Hear, husbandman of Villenskov, Attend to what I say; Who has to thee permission given To build where I have sway? "
21,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Since thou to build within my bounds Hast ta'en the liberty, Thou shalt to me thy housewife give, For I with her will lie."" "
22,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then answer made the hapless man, As God gave him the thought: ""Thou shalt not Ellen get from me, Like her I value nought."" "
23,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He answer made unto the Trold: ""Let but my wife alone, And do thou take my money and goods, And keep them for thy own."" "
24,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Then I will Ellen take, and thee, And tread ye both to gore; And I will take thy silver and gold And hide it 'neath my floor."" "
25,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"The yeoman and his household all Were seized with mighty fright: ""Better that one of us be lost Than all destroy'd outright."" "
26,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then up and stood the desp'rate man, With sore affliction rife; And he has given his Ellen dear To the young Trold for wife. "
27,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then wax'd he glad, and sprang about, So fondly her he pressed; O then how pale her cheeks became, She was so sore distrest! "
28,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Then out and spake the afflicted Dame Whilst shedding many a tear: ""O God in mercy look on me, My fate is hard to bear. "
29,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""I did possess as fair a man As ever walk'd-on mead, But now perforce with laidly Trold Must do adulterous deed."" "
30,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"He kiss'd her once, he kiss'd her twice, Her heart yet sadder grew; The laidliest Devil he became That man did ever view. "
31,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"When the third time he her would kiss She call'd on Mary's son; Then he became a lovely knight, His elfin shape was gone. "
32,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"It happen'd neath a linden green He was from woe releas'd; Then straightway fled all fear and dread, So well they all were pleas'd. "
33,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Hear, thou beloved Ellenlile, Consent my wife to be, And all the gold in England's isle I will bestow on thee. "
34,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""When I was little, Death from me My mother took away; My step-dame drove me forth, and I Became a Trold so gray. "
35,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""I'll give thy husband gifts of price And titles fair beside; In verity, thou yeoman's dame, Thou wilt become my bride."" "
36,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Thou noble knight, we'll thank the Lord From woe who set us free, If thou wilt wed some fair young maid You both may live in glee."" "
37,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""If thee I can't in marriage get I'll have thy daughter bright, And all thy benefits to me By crowning her requite. "
38,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"""Thanks, Ellen, thanks, thou woman wise, To praise thee I'll not cease; If I may not thy love obtain I'll leave thee here in peace."" "
39,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Now builds the yeoman on his isle, And no one him offends; His daughter bears old England's crown, And happy days she spends. "
40,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Now Ellen has, the yeoman's wife, Escap'd from care and harm; She's mother to a Queen, who sleeps Within a Monarch's arm. "
41,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"Who bore him first a daughter fine, And then a blooming heir; They thank'd the Lord on every side For all their fortune fair. "
42,ELLEN OF VILLENSKOV.,"The daughter now of Ellenlile Of England has the sway; And Ellen with her yeoman lives, Each other's equals they. "
45,URANIENBORG.,"Thou who the strand dost wander, Thy steps, O traveller, stay! Turn to the island yonder, And listen to my lay. Thy every meditation Bid hither, hither stray: On yonder banks its station Had once a Castelaye. "
46,URANIENBORG.,"In long past days in glory It stood, and grandeur sheen Now 'twas so transitory Its ruins scarce are seen. But in old days I warrant Its equal was not found; From every side apparent High tower'd it from the ground. "
47,URANIENBORG.,"For no sea-king intended I ween was yonder hold; Urania, it ascended In praise of thee so bold. Close by the ocean roaring, Far, far from mortal jars, It stood tow'rds heaven soaring, And tow'rds the little stars. "
48,URANIENBORG.,"A gate in the wall eastward, Display'd its mighty mouth; There was another westward, And spires stood north and south. The dome itself, high rearing, A slender spirelet bore, Upon it, ever veering, A Pegasus gilt o'er. "
49,URANIENBORG.,"Towers which the sight astounded In north and south were plac'd; Upon strong pillars founded, And with fair galleries grac'd. And there caught the attention Of those that thither stroll'd, Quadrants of hugh dimension, And speres in frames that roll'd. "
50,URANIENBORG.,"From yonder Castle, gazing Across the isle, you spied The woods, their heads up-raising, And ocean's bluey tide. The halls the sight enchanted With colours bright of blee; The gardens they were planted With many a flower and tree. "
51,URANIENBORG.,"When down came night careering And vanish'd was the sun, The stars were seen appearing All heaven's arch upon. Then far was heard the yelling, When you thereto gave heed, Of those that watch'd the dwelling, Four hounds of mastiff breed. "
52,URANIENBORG.,"The good knight ceas'd to walk on The fields of war and gore, His helm and sword the balk on He hung, to use no more. From earth, its woe and riot, His soul had taken flight, When in his chamber quiet He sat at dead of night. "
53,URANIENBORG.,"Then he his eye erected Into the night so far, And keen the course inspected Of every twinkling star. The stars his fame transported Wide over sea and land, And kings his friendship courted, And sought his islet's strand. "
54,URANIENBORG.,"But point the stars from heaven To lands far o'er the main; He went, by fortune driven, And ne'er returned again. The haughty walls through sorrow Have long since sunken low, And heavy plow-shares furrow Thy house, Urania, now. "
55,URANIENBORG.,"Each time the sun is sinking It friendly looks on Hveen; Its rays there linger, thinking On what the place has been. The moon hastes melancholy Past, past the coast so dear, And in love's transport holy Shines Freya's starlet clear. "
56,URANIENBORG.,"Then suddenly takes to heaving Of that same ruin'd hold The basis deep, believing It is some eve of old. For many moments gladly 'Twould rise up from the mould; But ah! it can't, and sadly Sinks in death's slumber cold. "

76,EPIGRAMS,"There's no living, my boy, without plenty of gold, But gold to obtain you must ever be bold. The Diver will never who feareth the shark Bring up precious pearls from the sea caverns dark. "
78,EPIGRAMS,"O think not you'll change what on high is designed, Though you lift up your hands and to heaven you shout; The Angel will grieve not, who governs the wind, Though a gust should the lamp of the widow blow out. "
80,EPIGRAMS,"Load not thyself with gold, O mortal man, for know No strength thou'lt have for loads when summon'd hence away. Avoid excess of meat, it maketh gross, I trow, And gross thou must not be when summon'd hence away; For through the narrow gate thou'lt find it hard to go Of death, if thou art gross when summon'd hence away.
