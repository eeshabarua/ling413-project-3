7,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"I chanced the other eve,-- But how I ne'er will tell,-- The paper to receive. That's published down in hell. "
8,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"In general one may guess, I little care to see This free-corps of the press Got up so easily; "
9,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"But suddenly my eyes A side-note chanced to meet, And fancy my surprise At reading in the sheet:-- "
10,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""For twenty weary springs"" (The post from Erebus, Remark me, always brings Unpleasant news to us)-- "
11,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Through want of water, we Have well-nigh lost our breath; In great perplexity Hell came and asked for Death; "
12,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'They can wade through the Styx, Catch crabs in Lethe's flood; Old Charon's in a fix, His boat lies in the mud, "
13,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'The dead leap over there, The young and old as well; The boatman gets no fare, And loudly curses hell.' "
14,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""King Minos bade his spies In all directions go; The devils needs must rise, And bring him news below. "
15,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Hurrah! The secret's told They've caught the robber's nest; A merry feast let's hold! Come, hell, and join the rest! "
16,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""An author's countless band, Stalked round Cocytus' brink, Each bearing in his hand A glass for holding ink. "
17,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""And into casks they drew The water, strange to say, As boys suck sweet wine through An elder-reed in play. "
18,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Quick! o'er them cast the net, Ere they have time to flee! Warm welcome ye will get, So come to Sans-souci! "
19,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Smelt by the king ere long, He sharpened up his tooth, And thus addressed the throng (Full angrily, in truth): "
20,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'The robbers is't we see? What trade? What land, perchance?'-- 'German news-writers we!'-- Enough to make us dance! "
21,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'A wish I long have known To bid ye stop and dine, Ere ye by Death were mown, That brother-in-law of mine. "
22,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'Yet now by Styx I swear, Whose flood ye would imbibe, That torments and despair Shall fill your vermin-tribe! "
23,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'The pitcher seeks the well, Till broken 'tis one day; They who for ink would smell, The penalty must pay. "
24,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""'So seize them by their thumbs, And loosen straight my beast E'en now he licks his gums, Impatient for the feast.'-- "
25,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""How quivered every limb Beneath the bull-dog's jaws Their honors baited him, And he allowed no pause. "
26,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"""Convulsively they swear, Still writhe the rabble rout, Engaged with anxious care In pumping Lethe out."" "
27,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Ye Christians, good and meek, This vision bear in mind; If journalists ye seek, Attempt their thumbs to find. "
28,THE JOURNALISTS AND MINOS.,"Defects they often hide, As folks whose hairs are gone We see with wigs supplied Probatum! I have done! "
30,BACCHUS IN THE PILLORY.,"Twirl him! twirl him! blind and dumb Deaf and dumb, Twirl the cane so troublesome! Sprigs of fashion by the dozen Thou dost bring to book, good cousin. Cousin, thou art not in clover; Many a head that's filled with smoke Thou hast twirled and well-nigh broke, Many a clever one perplexed, Many a stomach sorely vexed, Turning it completely over; Many a hat put on awry, Many a lamb chased cruelly, Made streets, houses, edges, trees, Dance around us fools with ease. Therefore thou are not in clover, Therefore thou, like other folk, Hast thy head filled full of smoke, Therefore thou, too, art perplexed, And thy stomach's sorely vexed, For 'tis turned completely over; Therefore thou art not in clover. "
31,BACCHUS IN THE PILLORY.,"Twirl him! twirl him! blind and dumb Deaf and dumb, Twirl the carle so troublesome! Seest thou how our tongues and wits Thou hast shivered into bits-- Seest thou this, licentious wight? How we're fastened to a string, Whirled around in giddy ring, Making all like night appear, Filling with strange sounds our ear? Learn it in the stocks aright! When our ears wild noises shook, On the sky we cast no look, Neither stock nor stone reviewed, But were punished as we stood. Seest thou now, licentious wight? That, to us, yon flaring sun Is the Heidelbergers' tun; Castles, mountains, trees, and towers, Seem like chopin-cups of ours. Learn'st thou now, licentious wight? Learn it in the stocks aright! "
32,BACCHUS IN THE PILLORY.,"Twirl him! twirl him! blind and dumb, Deaf and dumb, Twirl the carle so troublesome! Kinsman, once so full of glee, Kinsman, where's thy drollery, Where thy tricks, thou cunning one? All thy tricks are spent and past, To the devil gone at last Like a silly fop thou'lt prate, Like a washerwoman rate. Thou art but a simpleton. Now thou mayest--more shame to thee-- Run away, because of me; Cupid, that young rogue, may glory Learning wisdom from thy story; Haste, thou sluggard, hence to flee As from glass is cut our wit, So, like lightning, 'twill be split; If thou won't be chased away, Let each folly also stay Seest my meaning? Think of me! Idle one, away with thee! "
34,SPINOSA.,"A mighty oak here ruined lies, Its top was wont to kiss the skies, Why is it now o'erthrown?-- The peasants needed, so they said, Its wood wherewith to build a shed, And so they've cut it down. "
36,TO THE FATES.,"Not in the crowd of masqueraders gay, Where coxcombs' wit with wondrous splendor flares, And, easier than the Indian's net the prey, The virtue of young beauties snares;-- "
37,TO THE FATES.,"Not at the toilet-table of the fair, Where vanity, as if before an idol, bows, And often breathes a warmer prayer Than when to heaven it pays its vows; "
38,TO THE FATES.,"And not behind the curtain's cunning veil, Where the world's eye is hid by cheating night, And glowing flames the hearts assail, That seemed but chilly in the light,-- "
39,TO THE FATES.,"Where wisdom we surprise with shame-dyed lip, While Phoebus' rays she boldly drinks, Where men, like thievish children, nectar sip, And from the spheres e'en Plato sinks-- "
40,TO THE FATES.,"To ye--to ye, O lonely sister-band, Daughters of destiny, ascend, When o'er the lyre all-gently sweeps my hand, These strains, where bliss and sadness blend. "
41,TO THE FATES.,"You only has no sonnet ever wooed, To win your gold no usurer e'er sighed No coxcomb e'er with plaints your steps pursued, For you, Arcadian shepherd ne'er has died. "
42,TO THE FATES.,"Your gentle fingers ye forever ply, Life's nervous thread with care to twist, Till sound the clanging shears, and fruitlessly The tender web would then resist. "
43,TO THE FATES.,"Since thou my thread of life hast kindly spun, Thy hand, O Clotho, I now kiss! Since thou hast spared that life whilst scarce begun, Receive this nosegay, Lachesis! "
44,TO THE FATES.,"Full often thorns upon the thread, But oftener roses, thou hast strung; For thorns and roses there outspread, Clotho, to thee this lay be sung! "
45,TO THE FATES.,"Oft did tempestuous passions rise, And threat to break the thread by force; Oft projects of gigantic size Have checked its free, unfettered course. "
46,TO THE FATES.,"Oft, in sweet hours of heavenly bliss, Too fine appeared the thread to me; Still oftener, when near sorrow's dark abyss, Too firm its fabric seemed to be. "
47,TO THE FATES.,"Clotho, for this and other lies, Thy pardon I with tears implore; Henceforth I'll take whatever prize Sage Clotho gives, and asks no more. "
48,TO THE FATES.,"But never let the shears cut off a rose-- Only the thorns,--yet as thou will'st! Let, if thou will'st, the death-shears, sharply close, If thou this single prayer fulfill'st! "
49,TO THE FATES.,"Oh, goddess! when, enchained to Laura's breath, My spirit from its shell breaks free, Betraying when, upon the gates of death, My youthful life hangs giddily, "
50,TO THE FATES.,"Let to infinity the thread extend, 'Twill wander through the realms of bliss,-- Then, goddess, let thy cruel shears descend! Then let them fall, O Lachesis! "
52,THE PARALLEL.,"Her likeness Madame Ramler bids me find; I try to think in vain, to whom or how Beneath the moon there's nothing of the kind.-- I'll show she's like the moon, I vow! "
53,THE PARALLEL.,"The moon--she rouges, steals the sun's bright light, By eating stolen bread her living gets,-- Is also wont to paint her cheeks at night, While, with untiring ardor, she coquets. "
54,THE PARALLEL.,The moon--for this may Herod give her thanks!-- Reserves her best till night may have returned; Our lady swallows up by day the francs That she at night-time may have earned. 
55,THE PARALLEL.,"The moon first swells, and then is once more lean, As surely as the month comes round; With Madame Ramler 'tis the same, I ween-- But she to need more time is found! "
56,THE PARALLEL.,"The moon to love her silver-horns is said, But makes a sorry show; She likes them on her husband's head,-- She's right to have it so "
59,(WHEN THEIR MINIATURES WERE HANGING SIDE BY SIDE.),"In truth, when I have crossed dark Lethe's river, The man upon the right I'll love forever, For 'twas he first that wrote for me. For all the world the left man wrote, full clearly, And so we all should love him dearly; Come, left man! I must needs kiss thee! "
62,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"Once the nine all weeping came To the god of song ""Oh, papa!"" they there exclaim-- ""Hear our tale of wrong! "
63,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"""Young ink-lickers swarm about Our dear Helicon; There they fight, manoeuvre, shout, Even to thy throne. "
64,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"""On their steeds they galop hard To the spring to drink, Each one calls himself a bard-- Minstrels--only think! "
65,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"""There they--how the thing to name! Would our persons treat-- This, without a blush of shame, We can ne'er repeat; "
66,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"""One, in front of all, then cries, 'I the army lead!' Both his fists he wildly plies, Like a bear indeed! "
67,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"""Others wakes he in a trice With his whistlings rude; But none follow, though he twice Has those sounds renewed. "
68,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"""He'll return, he threats, ere long, And he'll come no doubt! Father, friend to lyric song, Please to show him out!"" "
69,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"Father Phoebus laughing hears The complaint they've brought; ""Don't be frightened, pray, my dears, We'll soon cut them short! "
70,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"""One must hasten to hell-fire, Go, Melpomene! Let a fury borrow lyre, Notes, and dress, of thee. "
71,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"""Let her meet, in this array, One of these vile crews, As though she had lost her way, Soon as night ensues. "
72,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"""Then with kisses dark, I trust, They'll the dear child greet, Satisfying their wild lust Just as it is meet!""-- "
73,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"Said and done!--Then one from hell Soon was dressed aright. Scarcely had the prey, they tell, Caught the fellow's sight, "
74,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"Than, as kites a pigeon follow, They attacked her straight-- Part, not all, though, I can swallow Of what folks relate. "
75,AN ANECDOTE OF HELICON.,"If fair boys were 'mongst the band, How came they to be-- This I cannot understand,-- In such company? .   .   .   .   . The goddess a miscarriage had, good lack! And was delivered of an--Almanac! "
79,BOOK I.,"The sullen mayor who reigns in hell, By mortals Pluto hight, Who thrashes all his subjects well, Both morn and eve, as stories tell, And rules the realms of night, All pleasure lost in cursing once, All joy in flogging, for the nonce. "
80,BOOK I.,"The sedentary life he led Upon his brazen chair Made his hindquarters very red, While pricks, as from a nettle-bed, He felt both here and there: A burning sun, too, chanced to shine, And boiled down all his blood to brine. "
81,BOOK I.,"'Tis true he drank full many a draught Of Phlegethon's black flood; By cupping, leeches, doctor's craft, And venesection, fore and aft, They took from him much blood. Full many a clyster was applied, And purging, too, was also tried. "
82,BOOK I.,"His doctor, versed in sciences, With wig beneath his hat, Argued and showed with wondrous ease, From Celsus and Hippocrates, When he in judgment sat,-- ""Right worshipful the mayor of hell, The liver's wrong, I see full well."" "
83,BOOK I.,"""He's but a booby,"" Pluto said, ""With all his trash and pills! A man like me--pray where's his head? A young man yet--his wits have fled! While youth my veins yet fills! Unless electuaries he'll bring, Full in his face my club I'll fling!"" "
84,BOOK I.,"Or right or wrong,--'twas a hard case To weather such a trial; (Poor men, who lose a king's good grace!) He's straight saluted in the face By every splint and phial. He very wisely made no fuss; This hint he learnt of Cerberus. "
85,BOOK I.,"""Go! fetch the barber of the skies, Apollo, to me soon!"" An airy courier straightway flies Upon his beast, and onward hies, And skims past poles and moon; As he went off, the clock struck four, At five his charger reached the door. "
86,BOOK I.,"Just then Apollo happened--""Heigh-ho! A sonnet to have made?"" Oh, dear me, no!--upon Miss Io (Such is the tale I heard from Clio) The midwife to have played. The boy, as if stamped out of wax, Might Zeus as father fairly tax. "
87,BOOK I.,"He read the letter half asleep, Then started in dismay: ""The road is long, and hell is deep, Your rocks I know are rough and steep . . . Yet like a king he'll pay!"" He dons his cap of mist and furs, Then through the air the charger spurs. "
88,BOOK I.,"With locks all frizzled a la mode, And ruffles smooth and nice, In gala dress, that brightly glowed (A gift Aurora had bestowed), With watch-chains of high price, With toes turned out, and chapeau bas, He stood before hell's mighty czar. "
90,BOOK II.,"The grumbler, in his usual tone, Received him with a curse: ""To Pomerania straight begone! Ugh! how he smells of eau de Cologne! Why, brimstone isn't worse. He'd best be off to heaven again, Or he'll infect hell's wide domain."" "
91,BOOK II.,"The god of pills, in sore surprise, A spring then backwards took: ""Is this his highness' usual guise? 'Tis in the brain, I see, that lies The mischief--what a look! See how his eyes in frenzy roll! The case is bad, upon my soul! "
92,BOOK II.,"""A journey to Elysium The infectus would dissolve, Making the saps less tough become, As through the Capitolium And stomach they revolve. Provisionally be it so: Let's start then--but incognito!"" "
93,BOOK II.,"""Ay, worthy sir, no doubt well meant! If, in these regions hazy, As with you folk, so charged with scent, You dapper ones who heaven frequent, 'Twere proper to be lazy, If hell a master needed not, Why, then I'd follow on the spot! "
94,BOOK II.,"""Ha! if the cat once turned her back, Pray where would be the mice? They'd sally forth from every crack, My very mufti would attack, Spoil all things in a trice! Oddsbodikins! 'tis pretty cool! I'll let him see I'm no such fool! "
95,BOOK II.,"""A pleasant uproar happened erst, When they assailed my tower! No fault of mine 'twas, at the worst, That from their desks and chains to burst Philosophers had power. What, has there e'er escaped a poet? Help, heaven! what misery to know it! "
96,BOOK II.,"""When days are long, folks talk more stuff! Upon your seats, no doubt, With all your cards and music rough, And scribblings too, 'tis hard enough The moments to eke out. Idleness, like a flea will gnaw On velvet cushions,--as on straw. "
97,BOOK II.,"""My brother no attempt omits To drive away ennui; His lightning round about him flits, The target with his storms he hits (Those howls prove that to me), Till Rhea's trembling shoulders ache, And force me e'en for hell to quake. "
98,BOOK II.,"""Were I grandfather Coelus, though, You wouldn't soon escape! Into my belly straight you'd go, And in your swaddling-clothes cry 'oh!' And through five windows gape! First o'er my stream you'd have to come, And then, perhaps, to Elysium! "
99,BOOK II.,"""Your steed you mounted, I dare say, In hopes to catch a goose; If it is worth the trouble, pray Tell what you've heard from me to-day, At shaving time, to Zeus. Just leave him then to swallow it; I don't care what he thinks a bit; "
100,BOOK II.,"""You'd better now go homeward straight! Your servant! there's the door! For all your pains--one moment wait! I'll give you--liberal is the rate-- A piece of ruby-ore. In heaven such things are rareties; We use them for base purposes."" "
102,BOOK III.,"The god at once, then, said farewell, At small politeness striving; When sudden through the crowds of hell A flying courier rushed pell-mell, From Tellus' bounds arriving. ""Monarch! a doctor follows me! Behold this wondrous prodigy!"" "
103,BOOK III.,"""Place for the doctor!"" each one said-- He comes with spurs and whip, To every one he nods his head, As if he had been born and bred In Tartarus--the rip! As jaunty, fearless, full of nous As Britons in the Lower House. "
104,BOOK III.,"""Good morrow, worthy sirs!--Ahem! I'm glad to see that here (Where all they of Prometheus' stem Must come, whene'er the Fates condemn) One meets with such good cheer! Why for Elysium care a rush? I'd rather see hell's fountains gush!"" "
105,BOOK III.,"""Stop! stop! his impudence, I vow, Its due reward shall meet; By Charles's wain, I swear it now! He must--no questions I'll allow,-- Prescribe me a receipt. All hell is mine, I'm Pluto hight! Make haste to bring your wares to light!"" "
106,BOOK III.,"The doctor, with a knowing look, The swarthy king surveyed; He neither felt his pulse, nor took The usual steps,--(see Galen's book),-- No difference 'twould have made As piercing as electric fire He eyed him to his heart's desire. "
107,BOOK III.,"""Monarch! I'll tell thee in a trice The thing that's needed here; Though desperate may seem the advice-- The case itself is very nice-- And children dragons fear. Devil must devil eat!--no more!-- Either a wife,--or hellebore! "
108,BOOK III.,"""Whether she scold, or sportive play, ('Tween these, no medium's known), She'll drive the incubus away That has assailed thee many a day Upon thine iron throne. She'll make the nimble spirits fleet Up towards the head, down towards the feet."" "
109,BOOK III.,"Long may the doctor honored be Who let this saying fall! He ought to have his effigy By Phidias sculptured, so that he May be discerned by all; A monument forever thriving, Boerhaave, Hippocrates, surviving! "
111,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"Maiden, stay!--oh, whither wouldst thou go? Do I still or pride or grandeur show? Maiden, was it right? Thou the giant mad'st a dwarf once more, Scattered'st far the mountains that of yore Climbed to glory's sunny height. "
112,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"Thou hast doomed my flowerets to decay, All the phantoms bright hast blown away, Whose sweet follies formed the hero's trust; All my plans that proudly raised their head Thou dost, with gentle zephyr-tread, Prostrate, laughing, in the dust. "
113,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"To the godhead, eagle-like, I flew,-- Smiling, fortune's juggling wheel to view, Careless wheresoe'er her ball might fly; Hovering far beyond Cocytus' wave, Death and life receiving like a slave-- Life and death from out one beaming eye! "
114,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"Like the victors, who, with thunder-lance, On the iron plain of glory dance, Starting from their mistress' breast,-- From Aurora's rosy bed upsprings God's bright sun, to roam o'er towns of kings, And to make the young world blest! "
115,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"Toward the hero doth this heart still strain? Drink I, eagle, still the fiery rain Of thine eye, that burneth to destroy? In the glances that destructive gleam, Laura's love I see with sweetness beam,-- Weep to see it--like a boy! "
116,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"My repose, like yonder image bright, Dancing in the waters--cloudless, light, Maiden, hath been slain by thee! On the dizzy height now totter I-- Laura--if from me--my Laura fly! Oh, the thought to madness hurries me! "
117,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"Gladly shout the revellers as they quaff, Raptures in the leaf-crowned goblet laugh, Jests within the golden wine have birth, Since the maiden hath enslaved my mind, I have left each youthful sport behind, Friendless roam I o'er the earth. "
118,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"Hear I still bright glory's thunder-tone? Doth the laurel still allure me on? Doth thy lyre, Apollo Cynthius? In my breast no echoes now arise, Every shamefaced muse in sorrow flies,-- And thou, too, Apollo Cynthius? "
119,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"Shall I still be, as a woman, tame? Do my pulses, at my country's name, Proudly burst their prison-thralls? Would I boast the eagle's soaring wing? Do I long with Roman blood to spring, When my Hermann calls? "
120,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"Oh, how sweet the eye's wild gaze divine Sweet to quaff the incense at that shrine! Prouder, bolder, swells the breast. That which once set every sense on fire, That which once could every nerve inspire, Scarce a half-smile now hath power to wrest! "
121,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"That Orion might receive my fame, On the time-flood's heaving waves my name Rocked in glory in the mighty tide; So that Kronos' dreaded scythe was shivered, When against my monument is quivered, Towering toward the firmament in pride. "
122,REPROACH--TO LAURA.,"Smil'st thou?--No? to me naught's perished now! Star and laurel I'll to fools allow, To the dead their marble cell;-- Love hath granted all as my reward, High o'er man 'twere easy to have soared, So I love him well! "
124,MATTHEW.,"MATTHEW. Gossip, you'll like to hear, no doubt! A learned work has just come out-- Messias is the name 'twill bear; The man has travelled through the air, And on the sun-beplastered roads Has lost shoe-leather by whole loads,-- Has seen the heavens lie open wide, And hell has traversed with whole hide. The thought has just occurred to me That one so skilled as he must be May tell us how our flax and wheat arise. What say you?--Shall I try to ascertain? "
125,LUKE.,"LUKE. You fool, to think that any one so wise About mere flax and corn would rack his brain. "
127,ACTAEON.,"Thy wife is destined to deceive thee! She'll seek another's arms and leave thee, And horns upon thy head will shortly sprout! How dreadful that when bathing thou shouldst see me (No ether-bath can wash the stigma out), And then, in perfect innocence, shouldst flee me! "
129,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"I am a man!--Let every one Who is a man, too, spring With joy beneath God's shining sun, And leap on high, and sing! "
130,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"To God's own image fair on earth Its stamp I've power to show; Down to the front, where heaven has birth With boldness I dare go. "
131,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"'Tis well that I both dare and can! When I a maiden see, A voice exclaims: thou art a man! I kiss her tenderly. "
132,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"And redder then the maiden grows, Her bodice seems too tight-- That I'm a man the maiden knows, Her bodice therefore's tight. "
133,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"Will she, perchance, for pity cry, If unawares she's caught? She finds that I'm a man--then, why By her is pity sought? "
134,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"I am a man; and if alone She sees me drawing near, I make the emperor's daughter run, Though ragged I appear. "
135,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"This golden watchword wins the smile Of many a princess fair; They call--ye'd best look out the while, Ye gold-laced fellows there! "
136,MAN'S DIGNITY.,That I'm a man is fully shown Whene'er my lyre I sweep; It thunders out a glorious tone-- It otherwise would creep. 
137,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"The spirit that my veins now hold, My manhood calls its brother! And both command, like lions bold, And fondly greet each other. "
138,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"From out this same creative flood From which we men have birth, Both godlike strength and genius bud, And everything of worth. "
139,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"My talisman all tyrants hates, And strikes them to the ground; Or guides us gladly through life's gates To where the dead are found. "
140,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"E'en Pompey, at Pharsalia's fight, My talisman o'erthrew; On German sand it hurled with might Rome's sensual children, too. "
141,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"Didst see the Roman, proud and stern, Sitting on Afric's shore? His eyes like Hecla seem to burn, And fiery flames outpour. "
142,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"Then comes a frank and merry knave, And spreads it through the land: ""Tell them that thou on Carthage's grave Hast seen great Marius stand!"" "
143,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"Thus speaks the son of Rome with pride, Still mighty in his fall; He is a man, and naught beside,-- Before him tremble all. "
144,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"His grandsons afterwards began Their portions to o'erthrow, And thought it well that every man Should learn with grace to crow. "
145,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"For shame, for shame,--once more for shame! The wretched ones?--they've even Squandered the tokens of their fame, The choicest gifts of heaven. "
146,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"God's counterfeit has sinfully Disgraced his form divine, And in his vile humanity Has wallowed like the swine. "
147,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"The face of earth each vainly treads, Like gourds, that boys in sport Have hollowed out to human heads, With skulls, whose brains are--naught. "
148,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"Like wine that by a chemist's art Is through retorts refined, Their spirits to the deuce depart, The phlegma's left behind. "
149,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"From every woman's face they fly, Its very aspect dread,-- And if they dared--and could not--why, 'Twere better they were dead. "
150,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"They shun all worthies when they can, Grief at their joy they prove-- The man who cannot make a man, A man can never love! "
151,MAN'S DIGNITY.,"The world I proudly wander o'er, And plume myself and sing I am a man!--Whoe'er is more? Then leap on high, and spring! "
153,THE MESSIAD.,"Religion 'twas produced this poem's fire; Perverted also?--prithee, don't inquire! "
155,"THOUGHTS ON THE 1ST OCTOBER, 1781.","What mean the joyous sounds from yonder vine-clad height? What the exulting Evoe? [63] Why glows the cheek? Whom is't that I, with pinions light, Swinging the lofty Thyrsus see? "
156,"THOUGHTS ON THE 1ST OCTOBER, 1781.","Is it the genius whom the gladsome throng obeys? Do I his numerous train descry? In plenty's teeming horn the gifts of heaven he sways, And reels from very ecstacy!-- "
157,"THOUGHTS ON THE 1ST OCTOBER, 1781.","See how the golden grape in glorious beauty shines, Kissed by the earliest morning-beams! The shadow of yon bower, how lovingly it signs, As it with countless blessings teams! "
158,"THOUGHTS ON THE 1ST OCTOBER, 1781.","Ha! glad October, thou art welcome unto me!-- October's first-born, welcome thou! Thanks of a purer kind, than all who worship thee, More heartfelt thanks I'm bringing now! "
159,"THOUGHTS ON THE 1ST OCTOBER, 1781.","For thou to me the one whom I have loved so well, And love with fondness to the grave, Who merits in my heart forevermore to dwell,-- The best of friends in Rieger [64] gave. "
160,"THOUGHTS ON THE 1ST OCTOBER, 1781.","'Tis true thy breath doth rock the leaves upon the trees, And sadly make their charms decay; Gently they fall:--and swift, as morning phantasies With those who waken, fly away. "
161,"THOUGHTS ON THE 1ST OCTOBER, 1781.","'Tis true that on thy track the fleecy spoiler hastes, Who makes all Nature's chords resound With discord dull, and turns the plains and groves to wastes, So that they sadly mourn around. "

Funeral silence--churchyard calm, Rapture change to dread alarm.-- Thus the plague God wildly praises! "

184,MONUMENT OF MOOR THE ROBBER. [65],"Crumble,--decay In the cradle of wide-open heaven! Terrible sight to each sinner that breathes, When the hot thirst for glory Raises its barriers over against the dread throne! See! to eternity shame has consigned thee! To the bright stars of fame Thou hast clambered aloft, on the shoulders of shame! Yet time will come when shame will crumble beneath thee, When admiration at length will be thine! "
185,MONUMENT OF MOOR THE ROBBER. [65],"With moist eye, by thy sepulchre dreaded, Man has passed onward-- Rejoice in the tears that man sheddeth, Oh thou soul of the judged! With moist eye, by the sepulchre dreaded, Lately a maiden passed onward, Hearing the fearful announcement Told of thy deeds by the herald of marble; And the maiden--rejoice thee! rejoice thee! Sought not to dry up her tears. Far away I stood as the pearls were falling, And I shouted: Amalia! "

Wildly his bit champs the charger of Phoebus; Though, 'neath the reins of his master, More gently he rocks earth and heaven, Reined by a child's hand, he kindles Earth and heaven in blazing destruction! Obstinate Phaeton perished, Buried beneath the sad wreck. "

298,FIRST YAGER.,"FIRST YAGER. (Taking his two neighbors by the hand. The rest do the same, forming a large semi-circle.) Away, then, my comrades, our chargers let's mount!

Unless ye have courage your life to stake, That life ye never your own can make! "

302,CHORUS.,"The lake forms an inlet in the land; a cottage is near the shore; a fisher-boy is rowing in a boat. Beyond the lake are seen the green pastures, the villages and farms of Schwytz glowing in the sunshine. On the left of the spectator are the peaks of the Hacken, enveloped in clouds; on his right, in the distance, are seen the glaciers. Before the curtain rises the RANZ DES VACHES, and the musical sound of the cattle-bells are heard, and continue also for some time after the scene opens. "
304,CHORUS.,"Bright smiles the lake, as it woos to its deep,-- A boy on its margin of green lies asleep; Then hears he a strain, Like the flute's gentle note, Sweet as voices of angels In Eden that float.

Ye meadows, farewell! Ye pastures so glowing! The herdsman is going, For summer has fled! "
307,CHORUS.,CHAMOIS-HUNTER (appearing on the top of a rock). AIR--Second Variation of the Ranz des Vaches. 
308,CHORUS.,"O'er the heights growls the thunder, while quivers the bridge, Yet no fear feels the hunter, though dizzy the ridge; He strides on undaunted, O'er plains icy-bound, Where spring never blossoms, Nor verdure is found; And, a broad sea of mist lying under his feet, Man's dwellings his vision no longer can greet; The world he but views When the clouds broken are-- With its pastures so green, Through the vapor afar. "
311,CHORUS.,"Bow and arrow bearing, Over hills and streams Moves the hunter daring, Soon as daylight gleams. "
312,CHORUS.,"As all flying creatures Own the eagle's sway, So the hunter, Nature's Mounts and crags obey. "
313,CHORUS.,"Over space he reigneth, And he makes his prize All his bolt attaineth, All that creeps or flies. "
316,CHORUS OF BROTHERS OF MERCY.,"Death comes to man with hasty stride, No respite is to him e'er given; He's stricken down in manhood's pride, E'en in mid race from earth he's driven. Prepared, or not, to go from here, Before his Judge he must appear! "
319,RIDDLE.,"The tree whereon decay All those from mortals sprung,-- Full old, and yet whose spray Is ever green and young; To catch the light, it rolls Each leaf upon one side; The other, black as coals, The sun has ne'er descried. "
320,RIDDLE.,"It places on new rings As often as it blows; The age, too, of all things To mortal gaze it shows. Upon its bark so green A name oft meets the eye, Yet 'tis no longer seen, When it grows old and dry. This tree--what can it mean? I wait for thy reply. [70] "
322,RIDDLE.,SCENE--A Park. MARY advances hastily from behind some trees. HANNAH KENNEDY follows her slowly. 
324,MARY.,"Let me my newly-won liberty taste! Let me rejoice as a child once again! And, as on pinions, with airy foot hast Over the tapestried green of the plain! Have I escaped from my prison so drear? Shall I no more in my sad dungeon pine? Let me in long and in thirsty draughts here Drink in the breezes, so free, so divine "
325,MARY.,"Thanks, thanks, ye trees, in smiling verdure dressed, In that ye veil my prison-walls from sight! I'll dream that I am free and blest Why should I waken from a dream so bright? Do not the spacious heavens encompass me? Behold! my gaze, unshackled, free, Pierces with joy the trackless realms of light! There, where the gray-tinged hills of mist project, My kingdom's boundaries begin; Yon clouds, that tow'rd the south their course direct, France's far-distant ocean seek to win. "
326,MARY.,"Swiftly-flying clouds, hardy sailors through air! Mortal hath roamed with ye, sailed with ye, ne'er! Greetings of love to my youthful home bear! I am a prisoner, I am in chains, Ah, not a herald, save ye, now remains, Free through the air hath your path ever been, Ye are not subject to England's proud queen! "
327,MARY.,"Yonder's a fisherman trimming his boat. E'en that frail skiff from all danger might tear me, And to the dwellings of friends it might bear me. Scarcely his earnings can keep life afloat. Richly with treasures his lap I'd heap over,-- Oh! what a draught should reward him to-day! Fortune held fast in his nets he'd discover, If in his bark he would take me away! "
328,MARY.,"Hear'st thou the horn of the hunter resound, Wakening the echo through forest and plain? Ah, on my spirited courser to bound! Once more to join in the mirth-stirring train! Hark! how the dearly-loved tones come again! Blissful, yet sad, the remembrance they wake; Oft have they fallen with joy on mine ear, When in the highlands the bugle rang clear, Rousing the chase over mountain and brake. "
331,MARY.,"Farewell, ye mountains, and ye pastures dear, Ye still and happy valleys, fare ye well! No longer may Joan's footsteps linger here, Joan bids ye now a long, a last farewell! "
332,MARY.,"Ye meadows that I watered, and each bush Set by my hands, ne'er may your verdure fail! Farewell, ye grots, ye springs that cooling gush Thou echo, blissful voice of this sweet vale, So wont to give me back an answering strain,-- Joan must depart, and ne'er return again! "
333,MARY.,"Ye haunts of all my silent joys of old, I leave ye now behind forevermore! Disperse, ye lambs, far o'er the trackless wold! She now hath gone who tended you of yore! I must away to guard another fold, On yonder field of danger, stained with gore. Thus am I bidden by a spirit's tone 'Tis no vain earthly longing drives me on. "
334,MARY.,"For He who erst to Moses on the height Of Horeb, in the fiery bush came down, And bade him stand in haughty Pharaoh's sight, He who made choice of Jesse's pious son, The shepherd, as his champion in the fight,-- He who to shepherds grace hath ever shown, He thus addressed me from this lofty tree: ""Go hence! On earth my witness thou shalt be! "
335,MARY.,"""In rugged brass, then, clothe thy members now, In steel thy gentle bosom must be dressed! No mortal love thy heart must e'er allow, With earthly passion's sinful flame possessed. Ne'er will the bridal wreath adorn thy brow, No darling infant blossom on thy breast; Yet thou with warlike honors shalt be laden, Raising thee high above each earthly maiden. "
336,MARY.,"""For when the bravest in the fight despair, When France appears to wait her final blow, Then thou my holy oriflamme must bear; And, as the ripened corn the reapers mow, Hew down the conqueror as he triumphs there; His fortune's wheel thou thus wilt overthrow, To France's hero-sons salvation bring, Deliver Rheims once more, and crown thy king!"" "
337,MARY.,"The Lord hath promised to send down a sign A helmet he hath sent, it comes from Him,-- His sword endows mine arm with strength divine, I feel the courage of the cherubim; To join the battle-turmoil how I pine! A raging tempest thrills through every limb; The summons to the field bursts on mine ear, My charger paws the ground, the trump rings clear. "
339,MARY.,SCENE--A hall prepared for a festival. The pillars are covered with festoons of flowers; flutes and hautboys are heard behind the scene. 
341,MARY.,"Each weapon rests, war's tumults cease to sound, While dance and song succeed the bloody fray; Through every street the merry footsteps bound, Altar and church are clad in bright array, And gates of branches green arise around, Over the columns twine the garlands gay; Rheims cannot hold the ever-swelling train That seeks the nation-festival to gain. "
342,MARY.,"All with one joyous feeling are elate, One single thought is thrilling every breast; What, until now, was severed by fierce hate, Is by the general rapture truly blessed. By each who called this land his parent-state, The name of Frenchman proudly is confessed; The glory is revived of olden days, And to her regal son France homage pays. "
343,MARY.,"Yet I who have achieved this work of pride, I cannot share the rapture felt by all: My heart is changed, my heart is turned aside, It shuns the splendor of this festival; 'Tis in the British camp it seeks to hide,-- 'Tis on the foe my yearning glances fall; And from the joyous circle I must steal, My bosom's crime o'erpowering to conceal. "
344,MARY.,"Who? I? What! in my bosom chaste Can mortal's image have a seat? This heart, by heavenly glory graced,-- Dares it with earthly love to beat? The saviour of my country, I,-- The champion of the Lord Most High, Own for my country's foe a flame-- To the chaste sun my guilt proclaim, And not be crushed beneath my shame? "
345,MARY.,"(The music behind the scene changes into a soft, melting melody.) "
346,MARY.,"Woe! oh woe! what strains enthralling! How bewildering to mine ear Each his voice beloved recalling, Charming up his image dear! "
347,MARY.,Would that battle-tempests bound me! Would that spears were whizzing round me In the hotly-raging strife! Could my courage find fresh life! 
348,MARY.,"How those tones, those voices blest Coil around my bosom burning All the strength within my breast Melting into tender yearning, Into tears of sadness turning! "
349,MARY.,(The flutes are again heard--she falls into a silent melancholy.) 
350,MARY.,"Gentle crook! oh that I never For the sword had bartered thee! Sacred oak! why didst thou ever From thy branches speak to me? Would that thou to me in splendor, Queen of heaven, hadst ne'er come down! Take--all claim I must surrender,-- Take, oh take away thy crown! "
351,MARY.,"Ah, I open saw yon heaven, Saw the features of the blest! Yet to earth my hopes are riven, In the skies they ne'er can rest! Wherefore make me ply with ardor This vocation, terror-fraught? Would this heart were rendered harder. That by heaven to feel was taught! "
352,MARY.,"To proclaim Thy might sublime Those select, who, free from crime, In Thy lasting mansions stand; Send Thou forth Thy spirit-band, The immortal, and the pure, Feelingless, from tears secure Never choose a maiden fair, Shepherdess' weak spirit ne'er! "
353,MARY.,"Kings' dissensions wherefore dread I, Why the fortune of the fight? Guilelessly my lambs once fed I On the silent mountain-height. Yet Thou into life didst bear me, To the halls where monarchs throne. In the toils of guilt to snare me-- Ah, the choice was not mine own! "
