110,NO!!!,"how many men could I find to hate ??? how many have betrayed me ??? 10, 100, 1000 or a million times more "
111,NO!!!,It's just how you look at it; 'cos if you don't have the time or the energy to hate then you will find true peace if only you look inside. 
113,NO!!!,I found you you found me we corresponded we fantasized 
114,NO!!!,I gave without questioning you promised it all but you delivered nothing 
115,NO!!!,had you really promised without thinking ??? or did your feet turn cold ??? 
117,NO!!!,"The lines flowed, the poem wrote itself and the expletives remained "
120,NO!!!,"The last time I was "" hearing voices"" again was only a couple of days ago. I was sick in bed with a viral infection. I was trying to sleep but voices kept saying "" Think what you know is true."" "
121,NO!!!,"But then I would think, "" Well what do I know is the truth ?"" "
122,NO!!!,"Then I'd think of something and say, well that's true, and quick as a flash another voice would say "" Is that really what you believe ? Is that what is true ? Isn't that bullshit ?"" "
123,NO!!!,And then I'd have to think of something else to believe in. 
124,NO!!!,And this was not a relaxed process. No way! It was manic. 
125,NO!!!,"It seemed to happen a 1000 times a minute, and it just wouldn't stop. "
126,NO!!!,"At least, it went on for an hour or so, and it seemed like an eternity. "
127,NO!!!,"Just another day in the life of ""a person with schizophrenia."" "
129,NO!!!,"Where do I start ? At the beginning of course, but where is that exactly ? I am (to state it in politically incorrectly language) a schizophrenic. "
130,NO!!!,And I have been living with that label for the past 15-odd years now. 
132,NO!!!,"But I count myself as one of the lucky ones because throughout all of times in and out of psych. wards of hospitals, "
133,NO!!!,"I kept the same job, with a large government organization, "
135,NO!!!,"Today, at work, in my lucky full time job as a government nobody, I get largely left alone and to my own devices. "
136,NO!!!,"For better or for worse, but always with an occasional supervisory peer over my shoulder to keep me in line. "
137,NO!!!,"""Oh yes, <Fred>, your job is safe, we do value your work, just keep going at your own pace. "
138,NO!!!,"We're not too sure where or how exactly you fit in, "
139,NO!!!,"but we like having you around, and, hey, somebody has to do the odd jobs, and we think you're just the man."" "
141,NO!!!,"Alas, I am not lucky enough to have a job that I'm in love with. "
143,NO!!!,Sometimes I think that I'm just a tiny cog in a ridiculously enormous machine - but there are also moments when keeping that cog turning seems to make a (slight) difference. 
146,NO!!!,"But, I always try to do the right things at work, for recognition perhaps, or perhaps simply to prove that I am really not incompetent at my job. "
147,NO!!!,"I can do it well, and I do it the best of my capabilities. "
148,NO!!!,And if that means that I hit brick walls then so be it - 
149,NO!!!,"I just have to get help when I hit one. I have learnt through bitter experience, that when I hit a wall, they will almost always out-stare me. "

156,NO!!!,"and through again, and back around, again and again, and tied off in a love knot. "

158,NO!!!,"Then she leaves me alone. I struggle a little. It is hopeless. I am helpless, totally! "
160,NO!!!,"The ropes bite in. Time passes, Hands become numb. The clock ticks on. I lose track of time, "
161,NO!!!,"it goes so slowly, how much longer will she make me wait ? "
162,NO!!!,"More time passes. Eventually she comes back. Soon I will have freedom, but not before we have played some more. "
163,NO!!!,"Oh, the agony. Oh, the ecstasy. I truly love it. "
164,NO!!!,"I can't wait for my freedom, then to do it all again. "
166,NO!!!,Ying tong tiddle high poe and other shades of Goonism drifting in and out of the corners of my mind reminiscing about those 
167,NO!!!,"hazy radio days crazy voices reverberating around the room antics of Milligan and co. amazing, surprising, "
170,NO!!!,"I can still vividly remember the last time that I was ""hearing voices"" (to use a worn out metaphor). "
171,NO!!!,It was less that a week ago. I had been there a thousand times before. 
172,NO!!!,"Yes, I am on medication. Yes, I do take it regularly. "
174,NO!!!,"It was a Saturday, and I hadn't gotten dressed all day, but instead I had been napping off and on all day. "
175,NO!!!,"I had also done my weeks washing and had it drying on a clothes horse in the lounge room (as is normal, being winter). "
176,NO!!!,It was early evening and I wanted to go to sleep. 
178,NO!!!,"Anyway, I couldn't get any sleep, and my mind was racing. "
180,NO!!!,Everyone will know the worst things that I can imagine. 
181,NO!!!,"They will know all about me and everything that I imagined people saying will be true now."" "
183,NO!!!,"They're crap, and I know it. They're just voices, I tell myself, but why won't they go away ? A short time passed. More voices, different voices, "
184,NO!!!,"""You know what to do, Mother always says so. What should I do now ? I don't know! But you know what to do, don't you ?"" "
187,NO!!!,"Time to get up from bed and ring Mum, after all she knows what to do. "
189,NO!!!,"I go to the phone, sit down, and phone ever-reliable Mum. "
192,NO!!!,She tells me to ring the Crisis Team (aka the Mental Health Triage) but I can only fumble with my electronic organizer. 
193,NO!!!,"I know exactly how it works, inside and out, but I could not operate it to save myself. "
194,NO!!!,I get a pen and Mum tells me the phone number of the crisis team and I write it down. 
195,NO!!!,She tells me that she can be on the next bus if I need her to be with me. 
196,NO!!!,"I tell her ""no thanks, I think I'll be OK"". I hang up the phone and call the Crisis Team. "
197,NO!!!,"I speak to a lady who knows me, although I cannot recall her. "
198,NO!!!,She talks me through it and tells me to watch a bit of TV or listen to some music and to occupy myself until later in the night. 
199,NO!!!,My mini-crisis passes as I follow this advice throughout the night. 
200,NO!!!,"Was it because I did all of the ""right things"" or was it simply that my ""medication"" was taking effect ? "
202,NO!!!,"The above episode was only a small tremor, but it still scared me a bit. "
203,NO!!!,I guess that I took it better than I otherwise might have because I have been there before and done it all before. 
204,NO!!!,But that doesn't make it any less scary at the time. It's only with the benefit of hindsight that I can see that I could cope with it.

210,NO!!!,"It's so easy for them, they just fall in love easy as pie "
211,NO!!!,"They say, "" It's not fair, It's so easy for them. Why doesn't it happen to me ?"" "

215,NO!!!,Here we go... on a fantastic journey of self discovery. 
216,NO!!!,"He told me: "" Just grab a pen and write whatever you feel. Let it flow. It's best when you don't premeditate your writing."" "
219,NO!!!,"But, I think, that's easier said than done. Don't I always try to think of what I'm going to say next, before I commit it to paper ? "
220,NO!!!,"But then I think, "" What is good writing anyway ? How will I know when I'm there ?"" "

238,NO!!!,"She is young and beautiful. But mostly she is a nubile, young thing. "
240,NO!!!,"She sneezes. Will I say "" Bless you"" ? Perhaps not. "

260,"STROKE, STROKE, STROKE,","It's good to have some real work to do. But now, of course, I have to work with crappy computers and a card file system that have stood still in time. "
261,"STROKE, STROKE, STROKE,","As the world evolved and got ready for the next millenium, we are stuck here in a 70s time warp with nothing but dusty old shelves and compactii and junk that belongs in a museum to work with. "

302,"STROKE, STROKE, STROKE,",But in the worst times of my life I only saw one set of footprints.

312,"STROKE, STROKE, STROKE,","I believe that the Bible lays out some very good ideals of how to live and how people should live by being ""nice"" to each other and so on, "
313,"STROKE, STROKE, STROKE,","but ultimately, I guess I just don't buy all of that fire and brimstone stuff, and miracles left, right and centre. "

It  was  warmly  received in the workshop,  and  thus  the  germ  of his poetry writing was planted and grew.
