5,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Young Hafbur King and Sivard King They lived in bitter enmity; 'Twas Signe proud that caused their feud, Of maidens all the fairest she. "
6,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"It was youthful Hafbur King Awaked at midnight with a bound, And full of dread he straightway said His wondrous dream to all around. "
7,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Methought I was in heaven's domain, Within that place so fair to view, And held to my breast my loved one prest, When down we fell the cloudlets through."" "
8,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And there sat all the Dames and maids And little heeded what he said; But lent an ear his mother dear, 'Twas she alone attention paid. "
9,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""My son do thou to the mountain go, And look that thou dost go with speed; The Daughter demand of Elfin land, And she to thee thy dream will rede."" "
10,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"It was young King Hafbur bold In his left hand he took his blade, And away he hied to the mountain's side To seek the lovely elfin maid. "
11,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"With his fingers white he thrice tapped light Upon the mountain's side so green; The daughter of Elle lay awake, and well Could guess what did that tapping mean. "
12,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Hail, daughter fair of Elfland's King, Whom here I see in costly wede! I beg for love of the God above That thou to me my dream wilt rede. "
13,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Methought I was in Heaven's domain, Within that place so fair to view, And held to my breast my loved one prest, When down I sank the cloudlets through."" "
14,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Thy dreaming thou wast in heaven, doth mean That thou shalt win the damsel proud; But that thou shalt die for her is shown By thy falling through the little cloud."" "
15,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""And if for me it destined be To win the maid for whom I sigh, I'll ne'er complain if Fate ordain That afterwards for her I die."" "
16,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Sir Hafbur lets his hair grow long, And maiden's clothes he caused be made; And away he rode to the high abode Of Siward King, to learn to braid. "
17,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"For himself he clothes has caused be made, All such as high born damsels wear; Then away rode he o'er hill and lea To seek King Siward's daughter fair. "
18,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When he had reached the castle yard In haste he smoothed his array; To the hall of state where ladies wait, And maids, then swift he takes his way. "
19,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now hail to you, ye lovely dames, And hail ye, maids of high degree! And hail the child that's Signild styled, The Dane King's child, if here she be! "
20,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Hail Signild, daughter of the King, Who here art spinning silken thread; Sir Hafbur me has sent to thee That thou mayst teach me how to braid."" "
21,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""If thou dost come by Hafbur sent, A welcome guest thou here shalt be; What I can impart of the braiding art I'll willingly impart to thee. "
22,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Whate'er I know of the braiding art I'll willingly to thee disclose; And thou thy meat from my dish shalt eat, And with my best loved maid repose."" "
23,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O I have eat with princely maids, And by their sides have often lain; I should pine, I trow, if bid to go To bed with one of the servant train."" "
24,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Well do not grieve my pretty may! We'll do thee no disgrace nor harm; And thou thy meat from my dish shalt eat, And thou shalt sleep within my arm."" "
25,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And there sat all the damsels proud, And with their work dispatch they made, Save Hafbur alone, the King's good son, Who with his needle often play'd. "
26,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"They sewed the hart, and they sewed the hind, In good green wood that ran about; Of cup of gold he scarce got hold But Hafbur all the wine drunk out. "
27,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"In came the wicked servant maid, In evil hour in came she: ""Where'er I've been I ne'er have seen A maid know less of broidery. "
28,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""A damsel fair I ne'er have seen Who understood of stitching less; And ne'er on earth a maid of birth Drink wine with greater eagerness."" "
29,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then out and said the wicked maid, And loud with her sharp voice she spake: ""No maid I've viewed of noble blood Such draughts of power ever take. "
30,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""She never sews so small a seam But with her needle she doth stop; No cup so great she gets, but straight She drains it to the bottom drop. "
31,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Two eyes she has, and eyes so bold In high born maid I ne'er have seen; And she doth bear of hands a pair Which cast of iron seem, I ween."" "
32,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now do thou hear, thou servant maid, Thy jeers at me why dost thou throw? Thou needst not fear or blame or sneer From me, however thou may'st sew. "
33,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Forego thy scoffs, forego thy jeers, And do not watch me in such guise; I thee don't mark on thy hand's work Whatever way I turn my eyes."" "
34,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"'Twas Hafbur then the King's good son To sew at length with zeal began; And he sewed hart and hind with art, E'en as they run pursued by man. "
35,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"He lilies sews, and roses bright, The birds upon the bough he sews; At his address they all express Surprise, they'd him by no means lose. "
36,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And on sewed they till end of day, And till some part of night was fled; With drowsy brows the proud maids rose, It lists them now to go to bed. "
37,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"So late it was at nightly tide, Down fell the dew o'er hill and mead; Then lists it her proud Signild fair With all the rest to bed to speed. "
38,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O where shall I a bed procure?"" Said Hafbur then, the King's good son. ""O thou shalt rest in chamber best With me the bolsters blue upon."" "
39,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Proud Signild foremost went, and stepped The threshold of her chamber o'er; With secret glee came Hafbur, he Had never been so glad before. "
40,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then lighted they the waxen lights, So fairly twisted were the same. Behind, behind, with ill at mind, The wicked servant maiden came. "
41,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"The lights were out, the train retired, They thought that they were all alone; His upper wede the knight with speed Did off, then bright his faulchion shone. "
42,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,King Hafbur with delighted heart Upon the bed himself has flung; I tell to ye for verity That as he fell his hauberk rung. 
43,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then out and spake proud Signelil, She could not wonder half enough: ""Since I've been born no maid has worn, That I have known, a sarke so rough."" "
44,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Her hand upon young Hafbur's breast Which shone with ruddy gold she laid: ""To me make known why are not grown Your breasts like those of another maid?"" "
45,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""'Tis custom in my father's land For maids to mount and ride to fight; My breasts not growing more, is owing Unto the chafe of my hauberk tight."" "
46,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And there reclined the night so long The youthful hero and the may; They talking kept and nothing slept, For in their hearts so much there lay. "
47,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now do thou hear, proud Signild fair, Since all alone ourselves we find, Tell me the truth, who is the youth For whom most stands your maiden mind?"" "
48,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O there is none within the world For whom I feel the least inclined, Save Hafbur young, whose deeds are sung, And he for me is not designed. "
49,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Save Hafbur young whom it has been These eyes hard fortune ne'er to see; I've heard alone his bugle blown, When to and fro the Ting rides he."" "
50,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""And if it is prince Hafbur young Whom them dost hold at heart so dear, Straight turn your face and on him gaze, For he does lie to thee so near."" "
51,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""If thou art he, why dost thou seek A princely maiden to inveigle? In manly sort to Siward's court Why cam'st thou not with hawk and beagle?"" "
52,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O maiden, to your father's house Long since I came with hawk and hound; But my desire he met with ire, Still in my ear his scoffs resound."" "
53,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"All, all the time that they did talk They thought that quite alone were they; But one stood near, and lent an ear To every word that they did say. "
54,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Shame, shame befall the wicked maid, 'Twas she brought much mishap to pass; She sly removed the sword approved Of Hafbur, and the new cuirass. "
55,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When she had removed the sword approved, And Hafbur's good cuirass beside; To the hall away where Sivard lay The wicked maiden swiftly hied. "
56,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Awake, awake, good Sivard King, Too much of sleep is in thy head! Prince Hafbur know is lying now With Signild fair in silken bed."" "
57,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""O young Prince Hafbur is not here, And it is false what thou hast told; To the Eastern main his way he's ta'en, With Russ and Finman fight to hold. "
58,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""So hold thy peace, thou wicked wench, Nor lying tongue 'gainst Signe turn; Ere morn shall dye the Eastern sky For thy foul slander thou shalt burn."" "
59,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now do thou hear, my noble Lord, Believe me all my words are true! For see, I have his polished glaive, And his cuirass of beaming blue."" "
60,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"So wroth grew Sivard at the sight, And loud around he 'gan to shout: ""Upstand ye all my merry men tall, For here is come a Kemp so stout. "
61,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now take ye brand and shield in hand, And look ye wield them both aright; Unto our home is Hafbur come, Unasked by me, the hard necked wight."" "
62,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Upon the door they struck with power, With shield and faulchion struck they hard: ""Come out, come out, young Bear,"" they shout, ""Come out unto the castle yard."" "
63,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When that heard she, proud Signelil Her lily hands she fell to wring: ""Ah! dost not hear, Prince Hafbur dear, How they for thee are clamouring?"" "
64,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Praise be to Hafbur, princely youth, Against a host he made a stand; They could not all the youth enthrall Till snapped the bed post in his hand. "
65,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"They Hafbur took, and him they placed In shackles strong and newly made; But them in twain he burst amain, As had they only been of lead. "
66,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then raised the ancient maid her voice, And cursed counsel came from her: ""Bind yonder Bear with Signe's hair, And hand or foot he will not stir. "
67,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Sirs, straightway bind ye Hafbur's hands With one of Signe's silken hairs; That little hair he will not dare To break, such love for her he bears."" "
68,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And they took two of Signild's hairs, And bound with them his mighty hands; Such love possest the Hero's breast, He would not burst the tiny bands. "
69,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then out and spake proud Signelil, Adown her cheeks the tears ran fast: ""O Hafbur tear the paltry hair, Thy Signe's free consent thou hast."" "
70,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And they placed Hafbur, son of the King, Fast bounden in the castle hall; Both maid and dame to see him came, And his own maiden first of all. "
71,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"They Hafbur took, the son of the King, And in strong irons him they laid; In woeful mood before him stood Full speedily his loving maid. "
72,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"To him with burning tears she spake: ""If Hafbur thou consent will give, My good aunts three on bended knee Shall intercede that thou shalt live. "
73,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""My father threatens steadfastly To hang thee on the oaken bough, Upon the moor at early hour Before again the sun shall glow."" "
74,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then answered young King Hafbur bold, And in high wrath the Hero spake: ""Too light I heed my life, to need That women prayer for me should make. "
75,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Hear, Signild, hear, do thou show clear This day for me thy love is great; When in the string thou see me swing Within thy bower burn thee straight."" "
76,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then answered him proud Signelil, With streaming eyes and heaving breast: ""By the God above, my dearest love, I'll grant to thee thy last request."" "
77,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"From out the gate they Hafbur led, The King's good son, at solemn pace; For him sore cried all him that eyed, So hard and stern they thought his case. "
78,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And when they reached the verdant plain, Where he the gallant youth should die; He begged he might have a short respite, He'd prove his Signe's constancy. "
79,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Do ye hang up my mantle red, That Sivard King the same may see; He may repent, and yet prevent Young Hafbur's hanging on a tree."" "
80,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"When Signild proud the mantle saw, The sight it pierced her like a knife: ""He's dead,"" she thought, ""it vails me nought To tarry longer here in life."" "
81,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"She called together her maids with speed, Concealing well her bosom's woe: ""To have some play we'll wend our way Unto the lofty chamber now."" "
82,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then out and spake proud Signelil, She spake in stern determined guise: ""This day I will my own self kill, And Hafbur join in Paradise. "
83,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""If any one in our band has helped To bring him to his death so foul, Shall rue his wrong when we ere long Shall burn together all to coal. "
84,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""So many there are in this palace fair Whom now the death of Hafbur gladdens; But venge will I their cruelty This moment on their plighted maidens."" "
85,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then fire she set to her bower high, The fire so hastily it blazed; How well she loved to all she proved Who on that conflagration gazed. "
86,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"It was Hafbur, son of the King, O'er his shoulder blade he cast his sight; Of Signe good the bower stood, Enwrapt in one tremendous light. "
87,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Now take ye down my mantle red, And let it lie upon the plain; Within my breast if I possessed Ten lives to beg them I'd disdain."" "
88,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"King Sivard out of the window looked, And on his mind such horror came; For Hafbur he saw hang on a tree, And Signild's bower enwrapt in flame. "
89,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Outspake amain the little foot swain, And he a mantle red had on: ""Now burns in bower the beauteous flower With her fair maidens, every one."" "
90,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"Then up and spake grey Sivard the King, His face with paleness ghastly all: ""A fate so dour as this I'm sure Did never princes two befall. "
91,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""If I before had heard or known The power of love was half so great, I'd ne'er, I swear, have vext the pair For all the wealth of Denmark's state. "
92,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"""Run some of ye to Signild's bower, And strive to bear my child relief; Let others race to the gallows place, For Hafbur bold was ne'er a thief."" "
93,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And when they came to Signe's bower All burnt they found the Lady fair; When out of breath they reached the heath, Hafbur was hanging dead in air. "
94,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"They Hafbur took, the son of the King, And round him linen white they roll'd; And him they laid beside his maid, With many a tear in Christian mould. "
95,HAFBUR AND SIGNE,"And then the wicked maid they took, And to a death so horrid doomed; A fitting bed for her they made, Alive the wretch they have entombed. "
