13,"JULY, 1908","_Of the poems of child-life brought together in this book many are wholly new; some are reprinted from ""The Singing Leaves,"" published in 1903; and others have appeared in Harper's Monthly Magazine, to the editor of which I am indebted for permission to reprint them._ _J. P. M._ JULY, 1908 "
57,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"First of all, I draw the Smoke Trailing up the sky; Then the Chimney, underneath; And Birds all flying by; Then the House; and every Window, Watching, like an Eye. "
58,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Everybody else begins With the House. But I Love the Smoke the best of all; And you don't know why!... Here it goes,--like little feathers, Sailing up the sky! "
60,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I have so many things to do, I don't know when I shall be through. "
61,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,To-day I had to watch the rain Come sliding down the window-pane. 
62,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And I was humming, all the time, Around my head, a kind of rhyme, "
63,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And blowing softly on the glass, To see the dimness come and pass. "
64,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I made a picture, with my breath Rubbed out to show the underneath. "
65,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I built a city on the floor; And then I went and was a War.-- 
66,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And I escaped, from square to square That's greener on the carpet, there, "
67,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Until at last, I came to Us: But it was very dangerous.-- "
68,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Because, if I had stepped Outside, I made believe I should have died! "
70,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And now I have the boat to mend; And all our supper to pretend. 
71,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I am so Busy, all the day, I haven't any time to play. "
73,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Those islands far away are mine, Beyond the cloudy strip; And something beautiful, besides:-- I think it is a Ship. "
75,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I let them call it just _The Wind_, And tell me not to grieve. But I know all it left behind, And more than they believe. "
76,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I know; about the far-off lands, Where people never sleep; They hide their faces in their hands, And rock, and weep, and weep. "
77,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And I too little, all alone, To go and find them yet;-- But Oh, I hear!--When I am grown, I never will forget. "
79,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"My Father brought somebody up, To show us all, asleep. They came as softly up the stairs As you could creep. "
80,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"They whispered in the doorway there, And looked at us awhile. I had my eyes shut up; but I Could feel him smile. "
81,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I shut my eyes up close, and lay As still as I could keep; Because I knew he wanted us To be asleep. "
83,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I'm always glad when Andrew comes. If only I am there, He stays awhile, and talks to me, As if he did not care. "
84,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"He took me to some Music once, When it was all for me. And Oh, I had a splendid time! And he said, So did He. "
85,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"It lasts as if the Music still Went round and round the sky.-- He said he had a good time, too; And I said, So did I! "
87,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I never saw the hills so far And blue, the way the pictures are; "
88,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And flowers, flowers growing thick, But not a one for me to pick! "
89,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"The land was running from the train, All blurry through the window-pane. "
90,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And then it all looked flat and still, When up there jumped a little hill! "
91,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I saw the windows and the spires, And sparrows sitting on the wires; "
92,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And fences, running up and down; And then we cut straight through a town. "
93,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I saw a Valley, like a cup; And ponds that twinkled, and dried up. "
95,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I counted meadows, that were burnt; And there were trees,--and then there weren't! "
96,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"We crossed the bridges with a roar, Then hummed, the way we went before. "
97,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,And tunnels made it dark and light Like open-work of day and night. 
98,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Until I saw the chimneys rise, And lights and lights and lights, like eyes. "
99,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And when they took me through the door, I heard It all begin to roar.-- "
100,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,I thought--as far as I could see-- That everybody wanted Me! 
102,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"They never seem to hurry,--no, Even for the crowd. They dip, and coo, and move as slow, All so soft and proud! You can see the wavy specks Of bubble-color on their necks; --Little, little Cloud. "
103,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Cloud that goes, the very way All the Bubbles do: Blue and green, and green and gray, Gold and rosy, too. And they talk as Bubbles could If they only ever would Talk and call and coo! "
104,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"--Till you try to catch one so, Just to make it stay While the colors turn. But Oh, Then they fly away!-- All at once, two, three, four, five-- Like a snowstorm all alive,-- Gray and white, and gray! "
106,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I wish she would not ask me if I love the Kitten more than her. Of Course I love her. But I love the Kitten, too; and It has Fur. "
108,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"It happens that way in the world With everything you see. Some people have their hair all curl'd, Some straight as straight can be. It is a Mystery. "
109,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Yes, some have hair that waves and clings, And does all kinds of curly things;-- And some not ever, till they Die. And nobody knows Why.... And some,--already born with Curls, Some of them are not even Girls! "
111,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I always think,--of Curly Hair, It looks as if the Curls came there The way I hum around a song More things than really do belong. The happier I feel, the more I sing, I never heard before! I curl more music round the Air, The way it looks with Curly Hair. "
113,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"But you may sing all day, you know; You cannot really make it grow. And you may know it is Not Fair; But that won't give you Curly Hair. "
115,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"[_Oh, the Day that I was Lost, I never shall forget: I wake up in the night sometimes, and think It's Happening Yet._] "
116,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"She let me go, a minute. She said she would take care; But she let me go, a minute: And then-- She wasn't there. "
117,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Everything grew awful That was good before. And the Faces didn't look Like people any more. 
118,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,It made you feel like Wrinkles All over you; and Cold. It made you feel two hundred And eighty-nine years old. 
119,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"It was like being Homesick, And Hurt; when no one Cares. It was exactly like a Wreck; And people smiled like Bears. "
120,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I thought that my own Mother Had just--Forgotten me! I thought that God had lost me, Like a Penny in the Sea. "
122,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"The Noise all seemed to grow and grow And roar until it drowned me.-- And I could only say,--'_I'm Lost_.'... And then, at last,--they Found me, --They Found me! "
124,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I feel polite, outside the door; But when it should begin, I can't remember Not to ask If just their Cat is in. "
125,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And if the Sun should sprinkle through Along the floor that way, I can't remember what I do If I am Urged to Stay. "
126,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And when I've shaken hands all round, --No matter how I try, I can't remember Not to go And Kiss their Dog good-by, --Good-by, --Good-by! "
127,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"_Yes, thank you, please.--They're Very Well; --I think I'd better go._ "
128,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"_Yes, thank you, please. I'm always late; My Mother told me so. Yes, thank you!--If I Have to Bring A message,--yes, I'll come; --And if your Bird will only Sing; --And when your Cat is home._ "
130,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"People say to me, 'A penny for your thought.'-- And I can't remember thinking; And I should think I ought. I wasn't sleeping, either: I know that, because I saw things out of both my eyes. I wonder where I was. "
131,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Now I'm back, I see them Sitting all around; And the noise, together, Makes a purring sound. But I know Something More Than just awhile ago. I know Something More!-- I wonder what I know. "
134,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I went to Market yesterday, And it is like a Fair Of everything you'd like to see; But nothing live is there: --The Pigeons, hanging up to eat; And Rabbits, by their little feet!-- And no one seemed to care. "
135,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And there were Fishes out in rows, Bright ones of every kind; Some were pink, and silver too; But all of them were blind. Yes, everything you'd like to touch.-- It would not make you happy much, But no one seemed to mind. "
136,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And loveliest of all, a Deer!-- Only its eyes were blurred; And hanging by it, very near, A beautiful great Bird. So I could smooth his feathers through, And kiss them, very softly, too: But Oh, he never stirred! "
138,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Why are some streets so different? The kittens all are long and thin; I think they have more flowers there, But broken things to grow them in. "
139,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Why do they like the house so high, With such a little of the ground? And do you think they ever see The Moon before it's old and round? "
140,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Why won't I like to play there, too?-- With all the funny things to eat, And all the carts with little bells, And dancing-music in the street? "
141,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And if I can't, then why do they Stay out, the whole of evening?-- Why do they always seem to have Just Not-Enough of everything? "
142,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,Why don't you come?--Why can't I go? It isn't Fair!--What makes it so?-- If they don't like it? Don't you know? Why do you always never know? 
144,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I wonder why you feel, somehow, It's wrong to leave a Chestnut stand, With all so much of what you want In both your pockets and your hand. I always have to turn around;-- It sounds so hurt--I don't see why-- That little high-up crying sound I don't remember by and by. "
145,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"There is not anything so good As Chestnuts (when they're hot) can be. It must be fun to count them out, With One for You and One for Me; And yet it stays so doleful there, --For all the People going by,-- And breathing frosty on the air, Like something trying not to cry. "
146,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"--It Isn't something I was Told!-- I know it's small and scared and thin.-- It's like when both your hands are cold, And Pockets you can't put them in! --Like something happened long ago; --Like feeling Homesick,--yes, and Shy; Like being Sorry,--when you know You won't remember, by and by. "
148,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I never dared to look away While they were tuning so, For fear the Curtain might go up, --And I not see it go!-- Then all at once, it all went Dark;-- To make you hold your breath and hark, --Oh, hold your breath and hark! "
149,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Excepting where the Curtain was, It stayed as black as night; And that kept still one minute more, All edged across with light:-- Then Up--and Up-- And Oh, so soon, It was like all Inside the Moon, --Yes, sitting in the Moon! "
150,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"And Oh, how Beautiful they were!-- And could we see them near?-- And Oh, how brave at everything! But it was somehow queer "
151,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"To see that smiling way they had: They smiled so much, but not all glad; --No, not so always glad. "
152,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"I wish we couldn't go away; I wish it would begin All over, now, and never end; I wish we were Locked In! Oh, can't we see it all again? To-morrow!--Sunday! Monday? When? --Ah, when, when? "
154,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Once, and in the daytime too, I made myself afraid, Playing Eyelids-Up-and-Down, with the window-shade; Till the Houses seemed to watch People going by; And they kept me looking, too,--wondering where and why. "
155,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"_If I were that Other Boy,--if I were those Men, Going by with things to sell,--who would I be, then?_ "
156,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Windows with their eyebrows high; windows like a frown, Thinking it all over, so, with the curtains down; Tall ones that are somehow sad, narrow ones that blink,-- All the Windows you can see make you think, and think. "
157,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"_If I were that Old Man, and I looked up at me Watching from the window here, Oh, then how would it be?_ "
158,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"Sometimes they are golden, with shining in their eyes.-- Every time the sun sets, it happens like surprise,-- And so bright, I almost forget the dream I made; But I keep it, for the days I want to make myself afraid. "
159,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"_If I were that Boy who limps,--now it's dark and snowing, And if I were going home,--Oh, where would I be going?_ "
161,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"My Mother cut it out for me, And started it, so I could see; And then she turned some edges in, And let me take it to begin. I made it. But I did not know How very long it takes to sew. I took a long time for that stitch; And now it's there, I don't know which Is better. But not one is small, And they are not alike at all. That side was very hard to fix. And then, the needle always pricks: But you must hold it, and take care,-- Because the point is always there; And knots keep coming by and by; And then, no matter how you try, The thread comes out of its old eye! "
163,THE GREEN SINGING-BOOK           44,"But some way, now I have it done,-- I think it is a Pretty One. "
167,I,"My Pitch-dark Angel with a Rosy Tongue, My Own--my Own, Why can't the grown-up Things we live among Let us alone? Why do they have to talk the livelong day About such silly things? But if they must,--why can't they, anyway, Have either Tails or Wings? "
169,II,"Of Course I cannot love them as they are, As much as You. Why aren't they ever really Beautiful, --They too?-- With curly coats, like wool; And floppy ears to pull; Yes, and a wide pink mouth, with such a Smile! Yes, and a Tail that beats time all the while; Beautiful, Beautiful!-- And golden stars, for eyes, Behind the darkest trees (Till your hair's parted)! Why can't they have such darling ways as these?-- Why can't they be so lovely when they sneeze?-- Why can't they ever be so tender-hearted, Or even look so wise As You?-- My Wonderful (even if you Won't say _Mew_), My True Prince in Disguise! Why can't they be As funny, when they try to sing a song? And when, for everything that I can do, They Won't Agree,-- Why can't they think they're always in the wrong? --Like You! "
171,III,"Why you,--O Precious Thing, You are swift (almost) as any Sparrow.-- Over the tall grass how you arch and spring, Yes, like a bow and arrow!-- Oh, and how good to see you, when it snows, Plough a long, lovely pathway with your nose! (No one grown-up could do it, I suppose.) "
173,IV,"My dearest Blessing and my Very Own, Even when I am grown, Never do you forsake me! If you don't go to heaven when you die, --Neither will I: Nothing can ever make me! I won't go, For all that they can do. No; on the steps Outside, and down, below, Forever and ever and ever, I'll stay too! --With You. "
175,IV,"If This is all it will be like, I wish to Die;--I don't care how-- While I am very, very young; As young as almost Now. "
176,IV,"They never felt what Sorrow was; Or never learned their Golden Rule; They say, _These are your happiest days_, --With School,--School,--School! "
177,IV,When Saturday's all out of breath With all the week before in sight;-- And Monday coming after you Spoils every Sunday night! 
178,IV,And Nothing done but yesterdays; And Nothing coming but to-morrows! Don't cheer me up. Please let me be. --I have the Sorrows. 
180,IV,"I have a secret to myself, That no one else can see. I hum it over to myself, And no one hears but me. --Something You don't know! I knew long ago.-- And the more I never tell you it, The more it gets to be. "
181,IV,"It makes me feel as purry As the Kitten on your knee. It makes me feel as round and warm As the Sparrow on that tree; It makes me puff my feathers out The way he puffs out his.-- And if you think I haven't one, I'll tell you what it Is, --Maybe! "
183,IV,"I know you're in the house; I know you are in there; I feel the green and breathing All around the air. I know you're safe and warm; I know you're very near. _Oh, darling Tree, Do you hear?_ "
184,IV,"I promised not to look (The way I did before), But I can hear you purring-- Purring, through the door: A green, soft, purring; Just as if you knew: _Everybody here Loves you._ "
185,IV,"Don't feel lonely, Now you are in-doors.-- Wait for all the shining things To-morrow,--all yours! Then you won't know what to think!-- All over Candle-light. --_Oh, darling Tree, Good-night._ "
186,IV,"And I love you, I love you; And everybody, too. And so does the market-man That brought us you! And if you haven't Anything For me, this year, --_I love you. Good-night! Do you hear?_ "
188,IV,"When I've wished on my first star, While the rest begin, And the grass is waking up, Oh, She calls us in!-- Then She calls us in. "
189,IV,"But I wouldn't go, unless I were sure there'd be Something more like that, indoors, Something more to see,-- Beautiful to see. "
190,IV,"So She lights the candle then, Where the shadows are, And it stands, and holds its breath-- Then it makes a Star,-- Then it makes a Star! "
191,IV,"I curl up for my good-night, Dark, where I can see. And I watch the Candle-light Till It looks at me, Oh, It looks at me! "
194,IV,"I've followed till the Sun was down, As low as to the very brink; And still the pathway kept along, Around the world, I think. "
195,IV,"I've tried to find it, everywhere A bell would clink, and clink, and call; But someway I can never find That Farthest One of all. "
196,IV,"I've been in all the tallest weeds,-- And thistles (with the loudest bees); And once, across the stepping-stones And through the cedar-trees. "
197,IV,"And now you hear it hushing up, And then you hear it clink and clink; And if you found it, it would lead Around the world, I think! "
198,IV,"It sounds so small, and gold, and far-- Far-off, beyond the lily-pool;-- And so, as if there must be there --Oh, something Wonderful! "
200,IV,"Excepting when they're very loud, And then, when they're almost too bright, I love to see a Thunder-Storm, Excepting when it's in the night. "
201,IV,"It's harder to remember, then: _It's Very Wicked not to trust A Thunder-Storm. Because it's Sure To know!--And then, besides, you Must._ "
202,IV,_For it will light your Heart up.--Yes; The Deepest Darkness ever Made Could Never Hide the Guilty One ... Who feels At All Afraid._ 
203,IV,"The thunder is the best of all,-- Except the wading for the Birds; And then, the Shining in the wet; --Oh, and the Rainbow, afterwards! "
205,IV,"It feels Forever without End, The time I have to stay. It's even harder to keep still Than pray and pray and pray. "
206,IV,"The reading happens all the time; The praying rolls along; And something makes them always sing A long, long song. "
207,IV,"So when I've nearly gone to sleep, I make my Penny walk.-- I walk it up and down, to hear The talk and talk and talk. "
208,IV,"And if I lose it on the floor Before they pass the Plate, Why then there's nothing more to do But wait--wait--wait.-- "
209,IV,"Till, when you'd have to go to sleep Or else you'd have to die, They let you Out,--and straight into The Sky! "
210,IV,"_With nests all hiding up the Trees, And Roads to make you Run:-- And everything like Squirrels!-- In the Sun--the Sun!_ "
212,IV,"They are more shy than Snow. You may look up and try to see one there, Just when you feel It breathing on your hair; But then It has to go.-- Somehow, I know. "
213,IV,"They want you to believe How bright they are, and never try to see Whether they keep their word. For that would be As if they could deceive. That makes them grieve. "
214,IV,"So, if you want Yours near, And hide your eyes and keep quite still; and say, ""_Oh, I have Wanted you all day--all day; Shine at me, Angel, dear!_"" It will be Here. "
216,IV,"He only looked like a Beggar-man, As ragged, just, as any. But he might have been an Angel, too. So I gave him my penny. "
217,IV,"I waited, till I thought I saw Him shining through. And when he Held out his hand, I watched for what Would happen to my penny. "
218,IV,"He might have been an Angel, too! But I know he wasn't any. For he frowned at me, like that, you see, When it wasn't but One penny. "
219,IV,"And now that's gone; and I don't care. I'd rather not have any, Than keep it, if an Angel came And asked me for my penny. "
221,IV,"I don't know how to read the words, Nor how the black things go. But if you stand it up, and sing, You never have to know. "
222,IV,"The music sounds alike each time When grown-up people play; But every time I sing, myself, It sounds a different way. "
223,IV,"And when I've sung the book all through, And every page, around, I stand it upside down and sing, To see how that will sound. "
224,IV,"I sing how all the things outside The window look to me; The shiny wrinkles in the road, And then, about my Tree; "
226,IV,"I sing about the City, too, The noises and the wheels; And Windows blinking in the sun;-- I sing the way it feels. "
227,IV,"And if a Sparrow flies across, I put him in the Song.-- I sing whatever happens in, To make it last for long. "
228,IV,I sing about the things I think Of almost everything. Sometimes I don't know what to Think --Till I begin to Sing. 
230,IV,"It happens when the birds go by And leave you far behind; And you flutter, till you ache All around your mind.-- Like a Flag, Like a Flag Flapping at the wind! "
231,IV,"It happens when you catch the hills As blue as yesterday; You hold your heart in both your hands, Or it would fly away. Yes, it would! Yes, it would! Away--away--away! "
232,IV,"It makes your heart into a Bird That darts, and leaps, and sings. --Oh, feel my pinafore, high up!-- Oh, do you think it's Wings? Do you think-- Do you think-- Oh, couldn't it be Wings? "
234,IV,"I like to lie and wait, to see My Mother braid her hair. It is as long as it can be, And yet she doesn't care. I love my Mother's hair. "
235,IV,"And then the way her fingers go; They look so quick and white,-- In and out, and to and fro, And braiding in the light; And it is always right. "
236,IV,"So then she winds it, shiny brown, Around her head into a crown, Just like the day before. And then she looks, and pats it down, And looks, a minute more.-- While I stay here, all still and cool. Oh, isn't Morning beautiful? "
238,IV,"The Wind's east,--Oh, Oh! Only a little while ago, To-day was just like yesterday. But now--now, only Now The world's all turned some silver way;-- I know how, I know how! "
239,IV,"The Wind's east, The Wind's east!-- Salt, salt Wind that I love so. All the things in the garden blow Wavy gray;--and the Trees all know,-- Trees that never, never can go, Must know how it would feel to be There, where the Ships sail to and fro, Ships on the blue, blue Sea! And the homesick ones by the bridge up here Are tugging to get their anchors clear, And they reach up high, to see. "
240,IV,"They catch their breath when they feel the air, And the rigging stirs, and the lanterns stare; For they know the tide is high out there, The gulls go skirling by, out there,-- The gulls and the Wind go free. And they tug, and they pull, and they wonder so When will the Captain let them go?-- Oh, Oh,--to Sea, To Sea! "
242,IV,"And shall we light the candle now? And leave, since there is so much more, Our cupful, and the share of bread, Here by the open door? "
243,IV,"For some one might be wanting it, If there should chance to come this way, A very poor Man; or a Bird;-- Or maybe, God, some day. "
