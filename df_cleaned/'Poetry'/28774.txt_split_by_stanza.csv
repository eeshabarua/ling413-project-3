7,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Sir Thor was a knight of prowess tried, The son of a king he was beside. "
8,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He was a knight excelled by none, At home such deeds of might he'd done. "
9,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"And not alone in his native home, But manhood had he displayed at Rome. "
10,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He faithfully served the emperor, And hatred to all his foes he bore. "
11,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"King of Norroway was his sire, His fame spreads over the world entire. "
12,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He was a King both aged and grey, So he summoned his son from Rome away. "
13,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He summoned his son from Rome away, To help him Norway's land to sway. "
14,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"As soon as the tidings reached Sir Thor, He hied to the Roman Emperor. "
15,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Hail, Emperor Ludvig, great and brave! Thy leave to return to my sire I crave."" "
16,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Freely shalt thou permission gain, And thy post shall vacant for thee remain."" "
17,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He greeted all the knightly train, They begged him quickly return again. "
18,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"When from Rome he came to his own countrie, His father welcomed him heartilie. "
19,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"His dear son married he fain would see, And divide with him his domain would he. "
20,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,He envoys sends with all despatch To seek a maid with his son to match. 
21,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,They travelled wide with unwearied mind Before his equal they could find. 
22,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"O'er land and sea so wide they speed, Until they reached the land of Swede. "
23,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"And when they reached the Swedish State, They found one worthy to be his mate. "
24,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Damsel Thura the maiden hight, In Swedish land was none so bright. "
25,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The loveliest maiden in all the land, Her father was high Sir Sallemand. "
26,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He was a noble rich and great, His equal was not in Sweden's State. "
27,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"So glad to Norroway back they wend, That the matter be brought to a happy end. "
28,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,They the tidings to their lord declare That they had found a damsel rare. 
29,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"No fairer was in the Swede countrie, Nor in all the isles there round that be. "
30,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,The heart of Sir Thor with joy beat loud When they described the damsel proud. 
31,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He spoke to his men, so gallant and stout, Who were to attend him in his rout: "
32,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""We must quickly away, so ready make, I've sworn an oath I dare not break, "
33,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""As soon as the lovely rose was found, To her o'er land and sea to bound."" "
34,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"They hoisted their sails on the yard so high, And out of the haven away they fly. "
35,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"So gay thence sailed they every one, To Sweden in less than a month they won. "
36,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The noble he steered his ship to the land, Sir Thor was the first who stepped on the sand. "
37,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The knight he sprang on his courser red: ""God help us now to this lovely maid."" "
38,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"As they through the land of Sweden hied, The folks received them with joy and pride. "
39,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"To Sir Sallemand's house came Sir Thor on his steed, Erect in his sables stood the Swede. "
40,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Here stand'st thou, Sir Sallemand, gallantly dight, Say, wilt thou house me with thee to-night?"" "
41,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""As one from God thou shalt welcome be, Respect and honour I pay to thee."" "
42,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"To the hall of the women Sir Thor led they, His eyes fell straight on the lovely may. "
43,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"They washed their hands and to table went, With the music and talk were they well content. "
44,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"And when they had feasted all so free, They cried for chess to increase their glee. "
45,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Sir Sallemand, listen to what I say, May I at chess with thy daughter play?"" "
46,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Yes, thou to play with her art free, Whether within or without I be."" "
47,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The young Sir Thor and Thure the maid, A game of chess at the table played. "
48,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The longer they played, they happier grew, Full pleased with each other were the two. "
49,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Hear thou, May Thure, thou lily bright, Wilt thou with thy white hand thyself to me plight?"" "
50,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Hear thou, Sir Thor, I tell thee plain, My faith and troth thou may'st obtain. "
51,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""My faith and troth I would plight to thee If I knew thou would'st be true to me."" "
52,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""May Christ destroy the dastard vile Who a noble maid would ever beguile!"" "
53,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"She gave him her troth with her hand so fair, But what she did more there was none aware. "
54,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"From his hand a gold bracelet he unbound, And placed it the Damsel's arm around. "
55,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Hear me, May Thure,"" then said he, ""How long wilt thou tarry a maid for me?"" "
56,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""I will, Sir Thor, if need there be, For eighteen winters wait for thee."" "
57,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""So long a time thou need'st not wait, No longer a time than winters eight."" "
58,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,When the eight winters they were o'er The damsel began to grieve so sore. 
59,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The damsel began to grieve so sore, And briny tears from her eyes to pour. "
60,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"A noble Duke has paid her his suit, A hero was he, on horse and on foot. "
61,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The Duke to her royal father said: ""Wilt give me counsel thy daughter to wed? "
62,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""And she I'll hold, till life depart, As the only lady of my heart."" "
63,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"So rash a man was Sir Sallemand, To the Duke he promised his daughter's hand. "
64,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""I'll give my daughter to thy good hand, She never shall go into Norroway land. "
65,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Sir Thor shall never behold the day, That he with her shall Norway sway."" "
66,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The Damsel Thure pined so sore, And the tears afresh down her cheeks did pour. "
67,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"To the castle bridge she wends her way, And watches the ships in the sound that lay. "
68,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Their sails both brown and white she viewed, And them with her fingers small she sewed. "
69,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""I sewed like sails with these fingers of mine, Perhaps Sir Thor yonder ploughs the brine."" "
70,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"So she lamented in piteous guise, But no one heard the maiden's cries. "
71,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""To his true love each lad comes home, And why not mine across the foam? "
72,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""O would to Christ I had a friend, That I to the shore a message might send. "
73,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""I'd give him presents rich and fair, If he would in secret my message bear."" "
74,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Straight then answered the little foot-boy: ""Thy message I'll bear to the strand with joy."" "
75,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The boy he ran to the yellow sand, Sir Thor was steering his ship to the land. "
76,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Sir Thor was the first who stepped to shore, To him his message the foot-boy bore. "
77,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""How speed the folk on this island, say? How speeds fair Thure, my plighted may?"" "
78,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""O well doth she speed through heaven's grace, To-morrow her bridal will take place. "
79,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""She's betrothed to a Duke of high degree, Live and die with her will he."" "
80,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Ere he shall gain my betrothed may, I'll have with that Duke a bloody fray."" "
81,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"His cloak of sable he o'er him throws, And unto Sir Sallemand's hall he goes. "
82,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He took the shining chess-table of gold, And into the high hall strode he bold. "
83,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Is there any man this hall within, Who at chess with me a game can win? "
84,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Who a game at chess can skilfully play, And win a foreigner's gold away?"" "
85,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"All then sate so hushed and still, None save May Thure would prove their skill. "
86,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"But Damsel Thure, she answered free: ""Yes, I will at chess-table play with thee."" "
87,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"May Thure covered her golden head, And unto her father she is sped. "
88,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Here thou sitt'st and drink'st wine from the shell, And may I sit down at chess-table? "
89,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""At the table a game of chess to play, Will help to beguile the longsome day."" "
90,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Yes, by the Saints! my daughter bright, At chess thou may'st play from now till night. "
91,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""At chess to play thou, my girl, art free, Whether within or without I be."" "
92,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Thereto her mother answer made, In evil arts she was deeply read: "
93,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Of Sir Thor the powerful have thou care, Lest he at chess-table thee ensnare. "
94,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Do thou with thy maids in thy bower stay, At tables of gold thou shalt not play."" "
95,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"But the maid no ear to her mother lent, To play at tables away she went. "
96,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The first game on the board they played Was won by Thure, the lily maid. "
97,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""The eagle flies across the moor, He heeds but little the tempest's roar. "
98,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""All that he findeth he swalloweth, How like to a woman devoid of faith!"" "
99,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""O do not cast such reproach at me, Remember I waited eight years for thee."" "
100,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Hear thou, Damsel, what word I say Wilt follow me now to Norroway?"" "
101,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""I'll follow thee gladly to Norroway's land, If I with thee can reach the strand."" "
102,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The Damsel she was a lily flower, She followed Sir Thor to the rugged shore. "
103,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He took her tenderly by the waist, And on the gilt prow the Damsel placed. "
104,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Sir Thor spread his sail on the yard-arm good, And out to the open sea he stood. "
105,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The wind filled bravely the silken sail, The ship sprang lightly before the gale. "
106,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Sir Thor he waved his hat with delight, ""Bid ye, Sir Sallemand, a long good night "
107,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""And tell the Duke, when he comes to wed, That Thor has taken his plighted maid."" "
108,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"A messenger swift Sir Sallemand hailed: ""Away with thy daughter Sir Thor has sailed!"" "
109,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"To that Sir Sallemand replied: ""She was his own betrothed bride."" "
110,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"But her mother said with a grimly frown: ""They soon shall sink to the bottom down. "
111,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""For I will cause a storm to blow, Shall make them both to the bottom go."" "
112,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Proud Mette and her nine witches hoar, They hurried screaming to the shore. "
113,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"She waked on the sea a tempest blast, The sand from the bottom the waves upcast. "
114,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"For seven long days, and long nights seven, Together were blended earth and heaven. "
115,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"But all the mother could send for their hurt, With ease the daughter could avert. "
116,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""O woe is me, how rash my part, When I taught her all my secret art!"" "
117,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"There was none on board that tide Who was able the ship to guide, "
118,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Save Damsel Thure, save her alone, And of her little pages one. "
119,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Thou little page, if thou'lt stand by me, Full fairly I reward will thee. "
120,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""The best of scarlet thou shalt don, And ride a noble horse upon."" "
121,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""I will faithfully by thee stand, Until in safety we gain the land."" "
122,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Answers Sir Thor in the hold as he lies: ""Many suffer yet promise not in that guise. "
123,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""And many as brilliant promises give, Yet never perform them whilst they live."" "
124,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Climb, little boy, on the mast so high, And see if to land we are drawing nigh. "
125,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""But whether thou steppest aft or afore, Step not, I pray, on my bridegroom Thor."" "
126,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""O lady, no more of the land I see Than the topmost bough of the good pine tree. "
127,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""No more of the pomp of the world can I Than just the top of the oak espy."" "
128,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""If the top of a tree salute thine eyes, 'Tis time to bid my bridegroom rise. "
129,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"""Sir Thor, arise, and stand on the prow, The Lord to the haven brings us now."" "
130,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"She steered the vessel towards the land, Sir Thor stepped first upon the sand. "
131,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The people of Norway thronged the shore, They welcomed so well their King, Sir Thor. "
132,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"They welcomed and blest their King, Sir Thor, But they welcomed and blest his lady more. "
133,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The Damsel he took in such gallant way, He lifted her up on his courser gray. "
134,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He bore her to his own castle fair, Where they did dwell devoid of care. "
135,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"His bridal with speed and with joy held he, To his own repose and to her great glee. "
136,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"He embraced so fondly her dainty frame, The crown he gave her and Queenly name. "
137,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"His palace she enters to wone therein, She dons the scarlet and ermine skin. "
138,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"The scarlet she wears, and the gold-laced shoe; May every knight as Sir Thor prove true! "
139,SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.,"Sir Thor to his faith was steady and true, And true to her troth was the lady too. "
141,TO AN OLD TUNE,"Who starves his wife, And denies her clothing? Bright the Shaker, The humbug Quaker! "
142,TO AN OLD TUNE,"_Merrily danced the Quaker's wife_, _Merrily danced the Quaker_; _But the wife of Bright is too starved to dance_, _And he's too fat to caper_. "
143,TO AN OLD TUNE,"He grudges the wretch a morsel of food, He grudges her even clothing; Once, 'tis said, to the cupboard she stole, But there to steal found nothing. "
144,TO AN OLD TUNE,"But Bright's as fat as a bacon hog, The old outrageous sinner; For he will stuff at any fool's cost, Who'll ask him home to dinner. "
145,TO AN OLD TUNE,"_Merrily danced the Quaker's wife_, _Merrily danced the Quaker_; _But the wife of Bright is too starved to dance_, _And he's too fat to caper_. "
146,TO AN OLD TUNE,"Who starves his wife, And denies her clothing? Bright the Shaker, The humbug Quaker! "
148,FROM ANACREON,"The earth to drink does not disdain, The trees drink of the earth full fain. "
149,FROM ANACREON,"Of the light air the sea drinks free, The red sun drinketh from the sea, "
150,FROM ANACREON,"And the red sun, at pride of noon, I've seen drunk up by the pale moon. "
151,FROM ANACREON,"Then why, friend, with me prove in ire, That I to drink too feel desire? "
153,FROM THE ITALIAN,"""Repent, O repent!"" said a Friar one day To a reprobate wretch, as expiring he lay; "
154,FROM THE ITALIAN,"""As I came up the stairs, I was frightened to see The devil who's waiting to seize upon thee."" "
155,FROM THE ITALIAN,"""You saw him then truly?""  ""Too truly, alas!"" ""And under what shape?""  ""Under that of an ass."" "
156,FROM THE ITALIAN,"""Well, well!"" cried the sinner, ""I am not afraid, You've only been terrified by your own shade."" "
158,A DRINKING SONG,O how my breast is glowing When I am drinking wine; And how my verse is flowing In honour of the nine. 
159,A DRINKING SONG,"How vanish grief and sorrow When I am drinking wine; Each thought about the morrow, Each project and design. "
