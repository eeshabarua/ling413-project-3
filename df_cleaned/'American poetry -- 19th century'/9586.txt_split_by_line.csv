1307,* P. 62.,while most of laniers poems are in a serious strain
1308,* P. 62.,several disclose no mean sense of humor  i refer to his dialect poems
1309,* P. 62.,such as joness private argyment uncle jims baptist revival hymn
1310,* P. 62.,and the power of prayer especially the last written in conjunction
1313,* P. 62.,there are passages in the poems no less pathetic than the poets life
1314,* P. 62.,in discussing his love of nature we have seen that he was a pantheist
1315,* P. 62.,in the best sense of the term  so delicate was his sensibility
1316,* P. 62.,that we do not wonder when we hear him declaring
1321,* P. 62.,a saying as felicitous as the romans i am a man and therefore
1323,* P. 62.,the ballad of trees and the master must touch all readers
1324,* P. 62.,few passages are more pathetic i think than that in june dreams
1325,* P. 62.,in january telling of the poets struggle for bread and fame
1326,* P. 62.,while his worshipful sweet wife sat still afar within the village
1327,* P. 62.,whence she sent him forth waiting all confident and proud and calm
1328,* P. 62.,and if there occurs therein a plaintive tone let us remember
1329,* P. 62.,that it is the only time that he complained of his lot
1330,* P. 62.,and that here really he has more in mind his dearer self his wife
1331,* P. 62.,and that calm succeeded to unrest just as it does in this passage
1357,* P. 62.,it is now time to say a word about laniers theory of art
1358,* P. 62.,especially the art of poetry  his views upon the formal side of poetry have
1359,* P. 62.,already been noticed in the consideration of his science of english verse
1362,* P. 62.,that lanier keenly appreciated the responsibility resting upon the artist
1369,* P. 62.,each artist  gift of terror  owns his will2
1383,* P. 62.,again the province of poetry is pointed out as in clover
1394,* P. 62.,in corn3 too the tall corncaptain types the poetsoul sublime
1402,* P. 62.,but it is in his prose works that lanier has treated the matter
1403,* P. 62.,most at length and to these i turn  in the first place
1404,* P. 62.,he insists that to be an artist one must know a great deal
1405,* P. 62.,a statement that would appear superfluous but for its frequent overlooking
1406,* P. 62.,by wouldbe artists  hence he is right in warning young writers
1407,* P. 62.,you need not dream of winning the attention of sober people with your poetry
1408,* P. 62.,unless that poetry and your soul behind it are informed and saturated
1409,* P. 62.,with at least the largest final conceptions of current science
1410,* P. 62.,that lanier strove to follow this precept we have abundant evidence
1411,* P. 62.,in his life and in his works and i think that if we remember
1412,* P. 62.,his environments we must wonder at the vastness the accuracy
1413,* P. 62.,and the variety of his knowledge  as additionally illustrative of the last
1414,* P. 62.,i may add that lanier invented some improvements for the flute
1415,* P. 62.,and made a discovery in the physics of music that the professor of physics
1423,* P. 62.,in the second place lanier thinks that a poets knowledge of his art
1424,* P. 62.,should be scientific  it was this that led him to write
1425,* P. 62.,the science of english verse the motto of which is
1426,* P. 62.,but the best conceptions cannot be save where science and genius are
1427,* P. 62.,in the english novel he declares that not a single verse
1428,* P. 62.,was ever written by instinct alone since the world began
1429,* P. 62.,and fortifies his statement by ben jonsons tribute to shakespeare 
1434,* P. 62.,but lanier clearly saw that no formal laws and no amount
1435,* P. 62.,of scientific knowledge could alone make a poet as appears from the motto
1436,* P. 62.,above quoted from the closing chapter of the science of english verse
1437,* P. 62.,which tells us that the educated love of beauty is the artists only law
1438,* P. 62.,and from this other motto from sir philip sidney  a poet
1439,* P. 62.,no industrie can make if his owne genius bee not carried unto it
1445,* P. 62.,in the third place lanier holds that a moral intention on the part
1446,* P. 62.,of an artist does not interfere with the naturalness or intrinsic beauty
1447,* P. 62.,of his work that in art the controlling consideration is rather moral
1448,* P. 62.,than artistic beauty but that moral beauty and artistic beauty
1449,* P. 62.,so far from being distinct or opposed are convergent and mutually helpful
1450,* P. 62.,this thesis he upholds in the following eloquent and cogent passage
1451,* P. 62.,permit me to recall to you in the first place that the requirement
1452,* P. 62.,has been from time immemorial that wherever there is contest
1453,* P. 62.,as between artistic and moral beauty unless the moral side prevail
1454,* P. 62.,all is lost  let any sculptor hew us out the most ravishing combination
1455,* P. 62.,of tender curves and spheric softness that ever stood for woman
1456,* P. 62.,yet if the lip have a certain fulness that hints of the flesh
1457,* P. 62.,if the brow be insincere if in the minutest particular the physical beauty
1458,* P. 62.,suggest a moral ugliness that sculptor  unless he be portraying
1459,* P. 62.,a moral ugliness for a moral purpose  may as well give over his marble
1460,* P. 62.,for pavingstones  time whose judgments are inexorably moral will not
1461,* P. 62.,accept his work  for indeed we may say that he who has not yet perceived
1462,* P. 62.,how artistic beauty and moral beauty are convergent lines which run back
1463,* P. 62.,into a common ideal origin and who therefore is not afire
1464,* P. 62.,with moral beauty just as with artistic beauty  that he in short
1465,* P. 62.,who has not come to that stage of quiet and eternal frenzy
1466,* P. 62.,in which the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty mean one thing
1467,* P. 62.,burn as one fire shine as one light within him he is not yet
1469,* P. 62.,that many fine and beautiful souls appear after a while
1470,* P. 62.,to lose all sense of distinction between these terms beauty truth love
1471,* P. 62.,wisdom goodness and the like and concludes thus  and if this be true
1472,* P. 62.,cannot one say with authority to the young artist  whether working
1473,* P. 62.,in stone in color in tones or in characterforms of the novel
1474,* P. 62.,so far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere
1475,* P. 62.,with your beautiful creation go forward in the clear conviction
1476,* P. 62.,that unless you are suffused  soul and body one might say 
1477,* P. 62.,with that moral purpose which finds its largest expression in love
1478,* P. 62., that is the love of all things in their proper relation 
1479,* P. 62.,unless you are suffused with this love do not dare to meddle with beauty
1480,* P. 62.,unless you are suffused with beauty do not meddle with love
1481,* P. 62.,unless you are suffused with truth do not dare to meddle with goodness 
1482,* P. 62.,in a word unless you are suffused with beauty truth wisdom goodness
1483,* P. 62.,and love abandon the hope that the ages will accept you as an artist
1487,* P. 62., the english novel p 280  of the numerous discussions of this thesis
1488,* P. 62.,the student should consult at least those by matthew arnold
1501,* P. 62.,milton has somewhere said that in order to be a great poet
1502,* P. 62.,one must himself be a true poem a dictum none the less trustworthy
1505,* P. 62.,i know of none that came nearer being a true poem than did lanier
1506,* P. 62.,he was as spotless as the lady of christs and infinitely more lovable
1507,* P. 62.,indeed he seems to me to have realized the ideal of his own knightly horn
1508,* P. 62.,who hopes that some day men will be maids in purity
1509,* P. 62.,i will not recall his gentle yet heroic life amid drawbacks
1510,* P. 62.,almost unparalleled for it is even sadder than it is beautiful
1511,* P. 62.,it is my deliberate judgment that while as the poet says
1512,* P. 62.,in his life and song no singer has ever wholly lived
1513,* P. 62.,his minstrelsy lanier came so near it that we may fairly say
1519,* P. 62.,and for my part i am as grateful for his noble private life
1526,* P. 62.,and yet i will not close with this picture of the man for my purpose
1527,* P. 62.,is rather to present the poet  hampered though he was by fewness of years
1528,* P. 62.,by feebleness of body by shortness of bread and most of all perhaps
1529,* P. 62.,by overluxuriance of imagination lanier was yet to my mind
1530,* P. 62.,indisputably a great poet  for in technique he was akin to tennyson
1531,* P. 62.,in the love of beauty and in lyric sweetness to keats and shelley
1532,* P. 62.,in the love of nature to wordsworth and in spirituality to ruskin
1533,* P. 62.,the gist of whose teaching is that we are souls temporarily having bodies
1535,* P. 62.,subtlest assertor of the soul in song  to be sure laniers genius
1536,* P. 62.,is not equal to that of any one of the poets mentioned
1537,* P. 62.,but i venture to believe that it is of the same order and therefore
1541,* P. 62., mr thayer puts it stronger  as a master of melodious metre
1542,* P. 62.,only tennyson and he not often has equalled lanier  mr f f browne
1543,* P. 62.,editor of the dial chicago compares the two poets in another aspect
1544,* P. 62.,the symphony of lanier may recall some parts of maud
1545,* P. 62.,but the younger poets treatment is as much his own
1546,* P. 62.,as the elders is his own  the comparison of lanier with tennyson will
1548,* P. 62.,which is his most striking quality  it may be doubted
1549,* P. 62.,if any english poet of our time except tennyson has cast his work
1550,* P. 62.,in an ampler mould or wrought with more of freedom or stamped his product
1551,* P. 62.,with the impress of a stronger personality  his thought his standpoint
1552,* P. 62.,his expression his form his treatment are his alone and through them all
1603,* P. 62.,life and song is the fifth of a series of seven poems
1618,* P. 62.,given in this volume 2 the ship of earth 3 how love looked for hell
1619,* P. 62.,4 tyranny 6 to richard wagner 7 a song of love
1621,* P. 62.,i can think of no more helpful comment on the subject of our poem
1623,* P. 62.,already alluded to in the introduction p liv part vi
1624,* P. 62.,and long it was not after when i was confirmed in this opinion
1625,* P. 62.,that he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter
1626,* P. 62.,in laudable things ought himself to be a true poem that is
1627,* P. 62.,a composition and pattern of the best and honorablest things
1628,* P. 62.,not presuming to sing high praises of heroic men or famous cities
1629,* P. 62.,unless he have in himself the experience and the practice of all that
1632,* P. 62.,lines 1920  i have been pleased to discover that the application
1633,* P. 62.,i have made of this poem especially of these lines
1635,* P. 62.,by most students of laniers life and that mrs lanier has chosen
1636,* P. 62.,these two lines for inscription on the monument to be erected to his memory
1637,* P. 62.,on the reverse side of the stone i may add are to be put these words
1638,* P. 62.,he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god i john iv 16

1974,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,how he came to write corn  i enclose ms of a poem
1975,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in which i have endeavored to carry some very prosaic matters
1976,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,up to a loftier plane  i have been struck with alarm
1977,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in seeing the numbers of deserted old homesteads and gullied hills
1978,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in the older counties of georgia  and though they are
1979,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,dreadfully commonplace i have thought they are surely mournful enough
1983,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,i have incidentally stated the theme of corn  instead of adding
1984,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,a more detailed statement of my own here i give judge bleckleys
1985,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,analysis of the poem which occurs in his reply to the abovementioned letter

1990,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,you paint the woods a cornfield and a wornout hill
1991,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,these are your landscapes  and your portrait is the likeness of an anxious

2003,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,a comparison of the first draft of corn as sent judge bleckley
2004,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,with the final form shows that lanier made many minute changes in the poem
2005,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,especially in the earlier part  still this earlier draft agrees substantially
2006,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,with the later and was so fine in conception and execution
2007,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,as to call forth this commendation of judge bleckley which
2008,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,despite the shortcomings of corn may with greater justice be applied
2009,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,to the poem in its present form  as an artist you seem to be italian
2010,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in the first two pictures and dutch or flemish in the latter two
2011,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in your italian vein you paint with the utmost delicacy and finish
2012,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,the drawing is scrupulously correct and the color soft and harmonious
2013,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,when you paint in dutch or flemish you are clear and strong
2014,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,but sometimes hard  there is less idealization and more of
2015,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,the realistic element  your solids predominate over your fluids
2017,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,as already stated lanier has two other poems that indirectly treat the theme

2685,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,for four hundred years  it controls all things it interprets the bible
2686,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,it guides our national and almost all our individual life with its maxims
2687,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,and its oppressions upon the moral existence of man have come to be
2688,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,ten thousand times more grievous than the worst tyrannies of the feudal system
2689,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,ever were  thus in the reversals of time it is now the gentleman
2690,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,who must rise and overthrow trade  that chivalry which every man has
2691,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in some degree in his heart which does not depend upon birth
2692,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,but which is a revelation from god of justice of fair dealing
2693,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,of scorn of mean advantages which contemns the selling of stock which
2694,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,one knows is going to fall to a man who believes it is going to rise
2695,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,as much as it would contemn any other form of rascality or of injustice
2696,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,or of meanness  it is this which must in these latter days
2697,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,organize its insurrections and burn up every one of the cunning moral castles
2698,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,from which trade sends out its forays upon the conscience of modern society
2699,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!, this is about the plan which is to run through my book
2700,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,though i conceal it under the form of a pure novel
2702,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,mr f f browne is doubtless right in saying that the symphony recalls
2703,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,parts of tennysons maud but the closest congeners of the symphony
2704,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in english are i think langlands piers the plowman in poetry
2705,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,and ruskins unto this last in prose  widely as these two works
2706,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,differ from the symphony in form they are one with it
2707,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in purpose and in spirit  all three voice the outcry of the poor
2708,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,against the hardness of their lot and their longing for a larger life
2709,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,all three show that the only hope of relief lies in a broader and deeper
2710,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,love for humanity  analogues to individual verses of the symphony
2719,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,5560  it is precisely this evil that ruskin has in mind i take it
2720,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,when he condemns the commercial text buy in the cheapest market and sell
2721,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in the dearest and when he declares that competition is the law of death
2727,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,which almost lulls one to sleep and the odyssey ix 80104
2740,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,complete poems p 213  these lines of the symphony show clearly that
2741,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,lanier did not believe that god made one law for man and another for woman
2742,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,or that one very grievous sin should forever blight a womans life

2871,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",as the titlepage shows the power of prayer is the joint production
2872,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",of sidney and clifford lanier  the latter gentleman informs me
2873,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that once he read a newspaper scrap of about ten lines stating that a negro
2874,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",on first seeing a steamboat coming down the river was greatly frightened
2875,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",mr lanier then wrote out in metrical form the plot of the power of prayer
2876,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",substantially as we now have it and sent it to his brother sidney
2877,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",who polished it up and published it under their joint names
2878,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",mr clifford lanier had not seen the piece mentioned in the next paragraph
2879,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",nor had his brother but on being shown the piece the former
2880,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",was of the opinion that his newspaper clipping must have been based
2881,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",on the work to which i turn as it had already appeared and the incidents
2884,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",in the third chapter of the gilded age hartford conn 1873
2885,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",by mark twain and charles dudley warner there is a piece

2887,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that i quote it almost entire  uncle danl a negro his wife
2888,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",his young mistress and his two young masters were sitting on a log
2893,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",uncle danl pointed down the river with his bony finger
2895,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",a deep coughing sound troubled the stillness way toward a wooded cape
2896,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that jutted into the stream a mile distant  all in an instant
2897,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",a fierce eye of fire shot out from behind the cape and sent
2898,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",a long brilliant pathway quivering athwart the dusky water  the coughing
2899,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",grew louder and louder the glaring eye grew larger and still larger
2900,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",glared wilder and still wilder  a huge shape developed itself
2901,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",out of the gloom and from its tall duplicate horns dense volumes of smoke
2902,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",starred and spangled with sparks poured out and went tumbling away
2903,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",into the farther darkness  nearer and nearer the thing came
2904,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",till its long sides began to glow with spots of light
2905,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",which mirrored themselves in the river and attended the monster
2914,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",it was not necessary to say it twice  they were all kneeling in a moment
2915,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and then while the mysterious coughing rose stronger and stronger
2916,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the threatening glare reached farther and wider the negros voice
2919,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",o lord wes ben mighty wicked an we knows dat we zerve to go

2940,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",uncle danl snatched a child under each arm and scoured into the woods
2941,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",with the rest of the pack at his heels  and then ashamed of himself
2942,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",he halted in the deep darkness and shouted but rather feebly
2947,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",to the surprise and comfort of the party it was plain
2948,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that the august presence had gone by for its dreadful noises were receding
2949,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",uncle danl headed a cautious reconnoissance in the direction of the log
2950,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",sure enough the lord was just turning a point a short distance up the river
2951,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and while they looked the lights winked out and the coughing

2981,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and he then recollected that in twains version it is god almighty

2983,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",makes a little difference and here he broke into a great laugh

3656,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then alan the huntsman sprang over the hillock the hounds shot by
3657,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",the does and the tentined buck made a marvelous bound
3659,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",but alan loud winded his horn in sign that the quarry was nigh
3661,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",for at dawn of that day proud maclean of lochbuy to the hunt had waxed wild
3662,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and he cursed at old alan till alan fared off with the hounds
3663,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",for to drive him the deer to the lower glengrounds
3664,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",i will kill a red deer quoth maclean in the sight of the wife
3667,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",so gayly he paced with the wife and the child to his chosen stand        21
3668,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",but he hurried tall hamish the henchman ahead  go turn 
3669,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",cried maclean  if the deer seek to cross to the burn
3670,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",do thou turn them to me  nor fail lest thy back be red as thy hand
3672,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",now hardfortuned hamish half blown of his breath with the height
3674,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",was white in the face when the tentined buck and the does
3676,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",his shouts and his nether lip twitched and his legs were oerweak
3679,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",so the deer darted lightly by hamish and bounded away to the burn
3681,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",still hamish hung heavy with fear for to go                              31
3682,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",all the space of an hour then he went and his face was greenish and stern
3684,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and his eye sat back in the socket and shrunken the eyeballs shone
3685,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",as withdrawn from a vision of deeds it were shame to see
3687,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",brake maclean and his wrath rose red as a beacon the wind hath upblown
3689,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",three does and a tentined buck made out spoke hamish full mild
3690,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and i ran for to turn but my breath it was blown and they passed
3691,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",i was weak for ye called ere i broke me my fast
3692,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",cried maclean  now a tentined buck in the sight of the wife and the child
3694,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",i had killed if the gluttonous kern had not wrought me
3696,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then he sounded and down came kinsmen and clansmen all
3697,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",ten blows for ten tine on his back let fall
3698,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong
3700,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",so hamish made bare and took him his strokes at the last he smiled
3701,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",now ill to the burn quoth maclean for it still may be
3703,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",i shall kill me the tentined buck for a gift to the wife and the child
3705,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then the clansmen departed by this path and that and over the hill
3706,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",sped maclean with an outward wrath for an inward shame
3707,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and that place of the lashing full quiet became                         51
3708,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the wife and the child stood sad and bloodybacked hamish sat still
3710,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",but look red hamish has risen quick about and about turns he
3711,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",there is none betwixt me and the cragtop he screams under breath
3713,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",he snatches the child from the mother and clambers the crag toward the sea
3715,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",now the mother drops breath she is dumb and her heart goes dead for a space
3716,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",till the motherhood mistress of death shrieks shrieks through the glen
3717,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and that place of the lashing is live with men
3718,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and maclean and the gillie that told him dash up in a desperate race
3722,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",they follow mad hamish afar up the crag toward the sea
3723,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the lady cries  clansmen run for a fee 
3724,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold
3726,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",fast hamish back from the brink  and ever she flies up the steep
3727,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the clansmen pant and they sweat and they jostle and strain
3729,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",stern hamish stands bold on the brink and dangles the child oer the deep
3731,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",now a faintness falls on the men that run and they all stand still
3732,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the wife prays hamish as if he were god on her knees
3734,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",for to spare him and hamish still dangles the child with a wavering will
3736,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",on a sudden he turns with a seahawk scream and a gibe and a song
3737,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",cries  so i will spare ye the child if in sight of ye all
3739,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and ye reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of the thong
3741,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then maclean he set hardly his tooth to his lip that his tooth was red
3742,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",breathed short for a space said  nay but it never shall be
3743,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",let me hurl off the damnable hound in the sea
3744,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",but the wife  can hamish go fish us the child from the sea if dead
3746,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",say yea   let them lash me hamish   nay 
3748,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",but oh who will heal me the bonny sweet bairn in his grave
3749,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",could ye cure me my heart with the death of a knave
3750,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",quick love i will bare thee  so  kneel  then maclean gan slowly
3753,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",with never a word till presently downward he jerked to the earth
3754,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then the henchman  he that smote hamish  would tremble and lag
3756,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then he struck him and one sang hamish and danced with the child
3759,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and no man spake beside hamish he counted each stroke with a song
3760,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",when the last stroke fell then he moved him a pace down the height
3761,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and he held forth the child in the heartaching sight                     91
3762,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",of the mother and looked all pitiful grave as repenting a wrong
3764,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and there as the motherly arms stretched out with the thanksgiving prayer 
3765,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and there as the mother crept up with a fearful swift pace
3766,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",till her finger nigh felt of the bairnies face 
3767,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",in a flash fierce hamish turned round and lifted the child in the air
3769,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and sprang with the child in his arms from the horrible height in the sea
3772,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",crawled up on the crag and lay flat and locked hold of dead roots
3775,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and gazed hungrily oer and the blood from his back
3777,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and a seahawk flung down a skeleton fish as he flew
3778,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the mother stared white on the waste of blue
3779,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the wind drove a cloud to seaward and the sun began to shine

3791,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",discussed the revenge of hamish kindly writes me that the author
3792,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",took the plot from william blacks novel macleod of dare
3793,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",in chapter iii macleod of castle dare mull tells the story
3794,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",to his london entertainer but as the story of the novel
3795,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",is identical with that of the poem it need not be given here
3796,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",the novel i should add gives the name of the chieftain only
3797,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",though as it has a hamish in another connection it doubtless gave lanier
3798,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",this name for the henchman  previous to the reception of mr taits letter
3799,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",i supposed that lanier had borrowed his plot from a poem by charles mackay

3801,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",is identical with laniers poem except that the former begins

3954,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",he did not include it for lack of space  this would seem to indicate
3956,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",the marshes of glynn had not yet achieved its later prominence
3957,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",as the greatest of sidney laniers poems  as now seems to be the opinion
3958,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",the setting of the poem is the salt marshes surrounding

3960,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",well deserving of the fame lanier has given it  and it was intended
3961,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",as one installment in a series of hymns of the marshes of which four poems

3974,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",a cosmic rhythm that is like unto the rhythmic beating of the heart of god
3979,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",indeed if one had to rely upon one poem to keep alive the fame of lanier
3980,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",he could single out the marshes of glynn with assurance
3981,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that there is something so individual and original about it
3982,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and that at the same time there is such a roll and range of verse in it
3983,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that it will surely live not only in american poetry but in english
3984,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",here the imagination has taken the place of fancy the effort
3985,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",to do great things ends in victory and the melody of the poem corresponds
3986,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",to the exalted thought  it has all the strong points of sunrise
3987,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",with but few of its limitations  there is something of
3989,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",combined with the haunting melody of poes best work  written in 1878

3991,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",it is the best expression of his genius and one of the few
3994,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",the background of the poem  as of sunrise  is the forest

4001,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",the poet represents himself as having spent the day in the forest
4002,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and coming at sunset into full view of the length and the breadth
4003,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the sweep of the marshes  the glooms of the liveoaks
4004,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the emerald twilights of the dim sweet woods of the dear dark woods
4005,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",have been as a refuge from the riotous noonday sun  more than that
