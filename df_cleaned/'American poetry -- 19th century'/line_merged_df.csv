0,* P. 62.,while most of laniers poems are in a serious strain
1,* P. 62.,several disclose no mean sense of humor  i refer to his dialect poems
2,* P. 62.,such as joness private argyment uncle jims baptist revival hymn
3,* P. 62.,and the power of prayer especially the last written in conjunction
4,* P. 62.,there are passages in the poems no less pathetic than the poets life
5,* P. 62.,in discussing his love of nature we have seen that he was a pantheist
6,* P. 62.,in the best sense of the term  so delicate was his sensibility
7,* P. 62.,that we do not wonder when we hear him declaring
8,* P. 62.,a saying as felicitous as the romans i am a man and therefore
9,* P. 62.,the ballad of trees and the master must touch all readers
10,* P. 62.,few passages are more pathetic i think than that in june dreams
11,* P. 62.,in january telling of the poets struggle for bread and fame
12,* P. 62.,while his worshipful sweet wife sat still afar within the village
13,* P. 62.,whence she sent him forth waiting all confident and proud and calm
14,* P. 62.,and if there occurs therein a plaintive tone let us remember
15,* P. 62.,that it is the only time that he complained of his lot
16,* P. 62.,and that here really he has more in mind his dearer self his wife
17,* P. 62.,and that calm succeeded to unrest just as it does in this passage
18,* P. 62.,it is now time to say a word about laniers theory of art
19,* P. 62.,especially the art of poetry  his views upon the formal side of poetry have
20,* P. 62.,already been noticed in the consideration of his science of english verse
21,* P. 62.,that lanier keenly appreciated the responsibility resting upon the artist
22,* P. 62.,each artist  gift of terror  owns his will2
23,* P. 62.,again the province of poetry is pointed out as in clover
24,* P. 62.,in corn3 too the tall corncaptain types the poetsoul sublime
25,* P. 62.,but it is in his prose works that lanier has treated the matter
26,* P. 62.,most at length and to these i turn  in the first place
27,* P. 62.,he insists that to be an artist one must know a great deal
28,* P. 62.,a statement that would appear superfluous but for its frequent overlooking
29,* P. 62.,by wouldbe artists  hence he is right in warning young writers
30,* P. 62.,you need not dream of winning the attention of sober people with your poetry
31,* P. 62.,unless that poetry and your soul behind it are informed and saturated
32,* P. 62.,with at least the largest final conceptions of current science
33,* P. 62.,that lanier strove to follow this precept we have abundant evidence
34,* P. 62.,in his life and in his works and i think that if we remember
35,* P. 62.,his environments we must wonder at the vastness the accuracy
36,* P. 62.,and the variety of his knowledge  as additionally illustrative of the last
37,* P. 62.,i may add that lanier invented some improvements for the flute
38,* P. 62.,and made a discovery in the physics of music that the professor of physics
39,* P. 62.,in the second place lanier thinks that a poets knowledge of his art
40,* P. 62.,should be scientific  it was this that led him to write
41,* P. 62.,the science of english verse the motto of which is
42,* P. 62.,but the best conceptions cannot be save where science and genius are
43,* P. 62.,in the english novel he declares that not a single verse
44,* P. 62.,was ever written by instinct alone since the world began
45,* P. 62.,and fortifies his statement by ben jonsons tribute to shakespeare 
46,* P. 62.,but lanier clearly saw that no formal laws and no amount
47,* P. 62.,of scientific knowledge could alone make a poet as appears from the motto
48,* P. 62.,above quoted from the closing chapter of the science of english verse
49,* P. 62.,which tells us that the educated love of beauty is the artists only law
50,* P. 62.,and from this other motto from sir philip sidney  a poet
51,* P. 62.,no industrie can make if his owne genius bee not carried unto it
52,* P. 62.,in the third place lanier holds that a moral intention on the part
53,* P. 62.,of an artist does not interfere with the naturalness or intrinsic beauty
54,* P. 62.,of his work that in art the controlling consideration is rather moral
55,* P. 62.,than artistic beauty but that moral beauty and artistic beauty
56,* P. 62.,so far from being distinct or opposed are convergent and mutually helpful
57,* P. 62.,this thesis he upholds in the following eloquent and cogent passage
58,* P. 62.,permit me to recall to you in the first place that the requirement
59,* P. 62.,has been from time immemorial that wherever there is contest
60,* P. 62.,as between artistic and moral beauty unless the moral side prevail
61,* P. 62.,all is lost  let any sculptor hew us out the most ravishing combination
62,* P. 62.,of tender curves and spheric softness that ever stood for woman
63,* P. 62.,yet if the lip have a certain fulness that hints of the flesh
64,* P. 62.,if the brow be insincere if in the minutest particular the physical beauty
65,* P. 62.,suggest a moral ugliness that sculptor  unless he be portraying
66,* P. 62.,a moral ugliness for a moral purpose  may as well give over his marble
67,* P. 62.,for pavingstones  time whose judgments are inexorably moral will not
68,* P. 62.,accept his work  for indeed we may say that he who has not yet perceived
69,* P. 62.,how artistic beauty and moral beauty are convergent lines which run back
70,* P. 62.,into a common ideal origin and who therefore is not afire
71,* P. 62.,with moral beauty just as with artistic beauty  that he in short
72,* P. 62.,who has not come to that stage of quiet and eternal frenzy
73,* P. 62.,in which the beauty of holiness and the holiness of beauty mean one thing
74,* P. 62.,burn as one fire shine as one light within him he is not yet
75,* P. 62.,that many fine and beautiful souls appear after a while
76,* P. 62.,to lose all sense of distinction between these terms beauty truth love
77,* P. 62.,wisdom goodness and the like and concludes thus  and if this be true
78,* P. 62.,cannot one say with authority to the young artist  whether working
79,* P. 62.,in stone in color in tones or in characterforms of the novel
80,* P. 62.,so far from dreading that your moral purpose will interfere
81,* P. 62.,with your beautiful creation go forward in the clear conviction
82,* P. 62.,that unless you are suffused  soul and body one might say 
83,* P. 62.,with that moral purpose which finds its largest expression in love
84,* P. 62., that is the love of all things in their proper relation 
85,* P. 62.,unless you are suffused with this love do not dare to meddle with beauty
86,* P. 62.,unless you are suffused with beauty do not meddle with love
87,* P. 62.,unless you are suffused with truth do not dare to meddle with goodness 
88,* P. 62.,in a word unless you are suffused with beauty truth wisdom goodness
89,* P. 62.,and love abandon the hope that the ages will accept you as an artist
90,* P. 62., the english novel p 280  of the numerous discussions of this thesis
91,* P. 62.,the student should consult at least those by matthew arnold
92,* P. 62.,milton has somewhere said that in order to be a great poet
93,* P. 62.,one must himself be a true poem a dictum none the less trustworthy
94,* P. 62.,i know of none that came nearer being a true poem than did lanier
95,* P. 62.,he was as spotless as the lady of christs and infinitely more lovable
96,* P. 62.,indeed he seems to me to have realized the ideal of his own knightly horn
97,* P. 62.,who hopes that some day men will be maids in purity
98,* P. 62.,i will not recall his gentle yet heroic life amid drawbacks
99,* P. 62.,almost unparalleled for it is even sadder than it is beautiful
100,* P. 62.,it is my deliberate judgment that while as the poet says
101,* P. 62.,in his life and song no singer has ever wholly lived
102,* P. 62.,his minstrelsy lanier came so near it that we may fairly say
103,* P. 62.,and for my part i am as grateful for his noble private life
104,* P. 62.,and yet i will not close with this picture of the man for my purpose
105,* P. 62.,is rather to present the poet  hampered though he was by fewness of years
106,* P. 62.,by feebleness of body by shortness of bread and most of all perhaps
107,* P. 62.,by overluxuriance of imagination lanier was yet to my mind
108,* P. 62.,indisputably a great poet  for in technique he was akin to tennyson
109,* P. 62.,in the love of beauty and in lyric sweetness to keats and shelley
110,* P. 62.,in the love of nature to wordsworth and in spirituality to ruskin
111,* P. 62.,the gist of whose teaching is that we are souls temporarily having bodies
112,* P. 62.,subtlest assertor of the soul in song  to be sure laniers genius
113,* P. 62.,is not equal to that of any one of the poets mentioned
114,* P. 62.,but i venture to believe that it is of the same order and therefore
115,* P. 62., mr thayer puts it stronger  as a master of melodious metre
116,* P. 62.,only tennyson and he not often has equalled lanier  mr f f browne
117,* P. 62.,editor of the dial chicago compares the two poets in another aspect
118,* P. 62.,the symphony of lanier may recall some parts of maud
119,* P. 62.,but the younger poets treatment is as much his own
120,* P. 62.,as the elders is his own  the comparison of lanier with tennyson will
121,* P. 62.,which is his most striking quality  it may be doubted
122,* P. 62.,if any english poet of our time except tennyson has cast his work
123,* P. 62.,in an ampler mould or wrought with more of freedom or stamped his product
124,* P. 62.,with the impress of a stronger personality  his thought his standpoint
125,* P. 62.,his expression his form his treatment are his alone and through them all
126,* P. 62.,life and song is the fifth of a series of seven poems
127,* P. 62.,given in this volume 2 the ship of earth 3 how love looked for hell
128,* P. 62.,4 tyranny 6 to richard wagner 7 a song of love
129,* P. 62.,i can think of no more helpful comment on the subject of our poem
130,* P. 62.,already alluded to in the introduction p liv part vi
131,* P. 62.,and long it was not after when i was confirmed in this opinion
132,* P. 62.,that he who would not be frustrate of his hope to write well hereafter
133,* P. 62.,in laudable things ought himself to be a true poem that is
134,* P. 62.,a composition and pattern of the best and honorablest things
135,* P. 62.,not presuming to sing high praises of heroic men or famous cities
136,* P. 62.,unless he have in himself the experience and the practice of all that
137,* P. 62.,lines 1920  i have been pleased to discover that the application
138,* P. 62.,i have made of this poem especially of these lines
139,* P. 62.,by most students of laniers life and that mrs lanier has chosen
140,* P. 62.,these two lines for inscription on the monument to be erected to his memory
141,* P. 62.,on the reverse side of the stone i may add are to be put these words
142,* P. 62.,he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god i john iv 16

163,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,corn was the first of laniers poems to attract general attention
164,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,for this reason as well as for its absolute merit the poem deserves
165,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in the first of his letters to the hon logan e bleckley
166,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,chiefjustice of georgia dated october 9 1874 lanier tells us
167,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,how he came to write corn  i enclose ms of a poem
168,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in which i have endeavored to carry some very prosaic matters
169,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,up to a loftier plane  i have been struck with alarm
170,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in seeing the numbers of deserted old homesteads and gullied hills
171,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in the older counties of georgia  and though they are
172,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,dreadfully commonplace i have thought they are surely mournful enough
173,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,i have incidentally stated the theme of corn  instead of adding
174,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,a more detailed statement of my own here i give judge bleckleys
175,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,analysis of the poem which occurs in his reply to the abovementioned letter
176,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,now for the general impression which your ode has made upon me
177,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,it presents four pictures three of them landscapes and one a portrait
178,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,you paint the woods a cornfield and a wornout hill
179,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,these are your landscapes  and your portrait is the likeness of an anxious
180,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,unthrifty cottonplanter who always spends his crop before he has made it
181,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,borrows on heavy interest to carry himself over from year to year
182,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,wears out his land meets at last with utter ruin and migrates to the west
183,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,and you give its portrait with many touches of marvel and mystery
184,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in vegetable life  your third landscape takes for an instant
185,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,the form and tragic state of king lear you thus make it
186,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,seize on our sympathies as if it were a real person and you then restore it
187,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,a comparison of the first draft of corn as sent judge bleckley
188,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,with the final form shows that lanier made many minute changes in the poem
189,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,especially in the earlier part  still this earlier draft agrees substantially
190,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,with the later and was so fine in conception and execution
191,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,as to call forth this commendation of judge bleckley which
192,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,despite the shortcomings of corn may with greater justice be applied
193,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,to the poem in its present form  as an artist you seem to be italian
194,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in the first two pictures and dutch or flemish in the latter two
195,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,in your italian vein you paint with the utmost delicacy and finish
196,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,the drawing is scrupulously correct and the color soft and harmonious
197,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,when you paint in dutch or flemish you are clear and strong
198,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,but sometimes hard  there is less idealization and more of
199,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,the realistic element  your solids predominate over your fluids
200,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,as already stated lanier has two other poems that indirectly treat the theme
201,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,of corn namely thars more in the man and joness private argyment
202,TO QUIT A-RAISIN' COTTON!,moreover he has the waving of the corn which though charming

381,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",of sidney and clifford lanier  the latter gentleman informs me
382,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that once he read a newspaper scrap of about ten lines stating that a negro
383,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",on first seeing a steamboat coming down the river was greatly frightened
384,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",mr lanier then wrote out in metrical form the plot of the power of prayer
385,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",substantially as we now have it and sent it to his brother sidney
386,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",who polished it up and published it under their joint names
387,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",mr clifford lanier had not seen the piece mentioned in the next paragraph
388,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",nor had his brother but on being shown the piece the former
389,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",was of the opinion that his newspaper clipping must have been based
390,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",on the work to which i turn as it had already appeared and the incidents
391,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",in the third chapter of the gilded age hartford conn 1873

394,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that i quote it almost entire  uncle danl a negro his wife
395,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",his young mistress and his two young masters were sitting on a log
396,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",uncle danl pointed down the river with his bony finger
397,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",a deep coughing sound troubled the stillness way toward a wooded cape
398,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that jutted into the stream a mile distant  all in an instant
399,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",a fierce eye of fire shot out from behind the cape and sent
400,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",a long brilliant pathway quivering athwart the dusky water  the coughing
401,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",grew louder and louder the glaring eye grew larger and still larger
402,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",glared wilder and still wilder  a huge shape developed itself
403,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",out of the gloom and from its tall duplicate horns dense volumes of smoke
404,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",starred and spangled with sparks poured out and went tumbling away
405,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",into the farther darkness  nearer and nearer the thing came
406,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",till its long sides began to glow with spots of light
407,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",which mirrored themselves in the river and attended the monster
408,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",it was not necessary to say it twice  they were all kneeling in a moment
409,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and then while the mysterious coughing rose stronger and stronger
410,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the threatening glare reached farther and wider the negros voice

431,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",with the rest of the pack at his heels  and then ashamed of himself
432,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",he halted in the deep darkness and shouted but rather feebly
433,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",to the surprise and comfort of the party it was plain
434,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that the august presence had gone by for its dreadful noises were receding
435,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",uncle danl headed a cautious reconnoissance in the direction of the log
436,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",sure enough the lord was just turning a point a short distance up the river
437,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and while they looked the lights winked out and the coughing

458,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and he then recollected that in twains version it is god almighty
459,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",that is coming up the bend  in yours it is the devil   which certainly
460,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",makes a little difference and here he broke into a great laugh

654,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",still hamish hung heavy with fear for to go                              31
655,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",all the space of an hour then he went and his face was greenish and stern
656,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and his eye sat back in the socket and shrunken the eyeballs shone
657,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",as withdrawn from a vision of deeds it were shame to see
658,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",brake maclean and his wrath rose red as a beacon the wind hath upblown
659,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",three does and a tentined buck made out spoke hamish full mild
660,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and i ran for to turn but my breath it was blown and they passed
661,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",i was weak for ye called ere i broke me my fast
662,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",cried maclean  now a tentined buck in the sight of the wife and the child
663,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",i had killed if the gluttonous kern had not wrought me
664,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then he sounded and down came kinsmen and clansmen all
665,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",ten blows for ten tine on his back let fall
666,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong
667,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",so hamish made bare and took him his strokes at the last he smiled
668,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",now ill to the burn quoth maclean for it still may be
669,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",i shall kill me the tentined buck for a gift to the wife and the child
670,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then the clansmen departed by this path and that and over the hill
671,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",sped maclean with an outward wrath for an inward shame
672,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and that place of the lashing full quiet became                         51
673,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the wife and the child stood sad and bloodybacked hamish sat still
674,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",but look red hamish has risen quick about and about turns he
675,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",there is none betwixt me and the cragtop he screams under breath
676,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",he snatches the child from the mother and clambers the crag toward the sea
677,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",now the mother drops breath she is dumb and her heart goes dead for a space
678,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",till the motherhood mistress of death shrieks shrieks through the glen
679,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and that place of the lashing is live with men
680,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and maclean and the gillie that told him dash up in a desperate race
681,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",they follow mad hamish afar up the crag toward the sea
682,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the lady cries  clansmen run for a fee 
683,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold
684,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",fast hamish back from the brink  and ever she flies up the steep
685,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the clansmen pant and they sweat and they jostle and strain
686,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",stern hamish stands bold on the brink and dangles the child oer the deep
687,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",now a faintness falls on the men that run and they all stand still
688,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the wife prays hamish as if he were god on her knees
689,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",for to spare him and hamish still dangles the child with a wavering will
690,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",on a sudden he turns with a seahawk scream and a gibe and a song
691,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",cries  so i will spare ye the child if in sight of ye all
692,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and ye reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of the thong
693,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then maclean he set hardly his tooth to his lip that his tooth was red
694,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",breathed short for a space said  nay but it never shall be
695,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",let me hurl off the damnable hound in the sea
696,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",but the wife  can hamish go fish us the child from the sea if dead
697,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",say yea   let them lash me hamish   nay 
698,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",but oh who will heal me the bonny sweet bairn in his grave
699,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",could ye cure me my heart with the death of a knave
700,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",quick love i will bare thee  so  kneel  then maclean gan slowly
701,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",with never a word till presently downward he jerked to the earth
702,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then the henchman  he that smote hamish  would tremble and lag
703,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",then he struck him and one sang hamish and danced with the child
704,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and no man spake beside hamish he counted each stroke with a song
705,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",when the last stroke fell then he moved him a pace down the height
706,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and he held forth the child in the heartaching sight                     91
707,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",of the mother and looked all pitiful grave as repenting a wrong
708,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and there as the motherly arms stretched out with the thanksgiving prayer 
709,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and there as the mother crept up with a fearful swift pace
710,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",till her finger nigh felt of the bairnies face 
711,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",in a flash fierce hamish turned round and lifted the child in the air
712,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and sprang with the child in his arms from the horrible height in the sea
713,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",crawled up on the crag and lay flat and locked hold of dead roots
714,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and gazed hungrily oer and the blood from his back
715,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and a seahawk flung down a skeleton fish as he flew
716,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the mother stared white on the waste of blue
717,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",and the wind drove a cloud to seaward and the sun began to shine
718,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",pp xlv xlvii part iv mr j r tait a friend with whom mr lanier
719,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",discussed the revenge of hamish kindly writes me that the author
720,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",took the plot from william blacks novel macleod of dare
721,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",in chapter iii macleod of castle dare mull tells the story
722,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",to his london entertainer but as the story of the novel
723,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",is identical with that of the poem it need not be given here
724,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",the novel i should add gives the name of the chieftain only
725,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",though as it has a hamish in another connection it doubtless gave lanier
726,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",this name for the henchman  previous to the reception of mr taits letter
727,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",i supposed that lanier had borrowed his plot from a poem by charles mackay

729,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",is identical with laniers poem except that the former begins

811,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",edwin mims in his biography of sidney lanier concludes by quoting this poem
812,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",his best poems move to the cadence of a tune     sometimes as in
813,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",the marshes of glynn and in the best parts of sunrise there is
814,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",a cosmic rhythm that is like unto the rhythmic beating of the heart of god
815,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",indeed if one had to rely upon one poem to keep alive the fame of lanier
816,"YAS, DINAH, WHAR 'OULD YOU BE NOW, JES' 'CEPTIN' FUR DAT PRA'R?",he could single out the marshes of glynn with assurance
