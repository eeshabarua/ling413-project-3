39,PREFACE,in _homer and the epic_ ten or twelve years ago i examined the
40,PREFACE,literary objections to homeric unity these objections are chiefly based
41,PREFACE,on alleged discrepancies in the narrative of which no one poet it
42,PREFACE,is supposed could have been guilty the critics repose i venture
43,PREFACE,to think mainly on a fallacy we may style it the fallacy of the
44,PREFACE,analytical reader the poet is expected to satisfy a minutely critical
45,PREFACE,reader a personage whom he could not foresee and whom he did not
47,PREFACE,has recently reminded his countrymen homer is put to a test which
48,PREFACE,goethe could not endure no long fictitious narrative can satisfy the
51,PREFACE,the fallacy is that of disregarding the homeric poets audience he
52,PREFACE,did not sing for aristotle or for aristarchus or for modern minute
53,PREFACE,and reflective inquirers but for warriors and ladies he certainly
54,PREFACE,satisfied them but if he does not satisfy microscopic professors he is
55,PREFACE,described as a syndicate of many minstrels living in many ages
57,PREFACE,in the present volume little is said in defence of the poets
58,PREFACE,consistency several chapters on that point have been excised the way
59,PREFACE,of living which homer describes is examined and an effort is made to
60,PREFACE,prove that he depicts the life of a single brief age of culture the
61,PREFACE,investigation is compelled to a tedious minuteness because the points
63,PREFACE,details of existenceare so minute as to be all but invisible
65,PREFACE,the unity of the epics is not so important a topic as the methods of
66,PREFACE,criticism they ought to be sober logical and selfconsistent when
67,PREFACE,these qualities are absent homeric criticism may be described in the
68,PREFACE,recent words of blass as a swamp haunted by wandering fires will o
71,PREFACE,in our country many of the most eminent scholars are no believers in
72,PREFACE,separatist criticism justly admiring the industry and erudition of the
73,PREFACE,separatists they are unmoved by their arguments to which they do
74,PREFACE,not reply being convinced in their own minds but the number and
75,PREFACE,perseverance of the separatists make on the general reader the
76,PREFACE,impression that homeric unity is chose _jugée_ that _scientia locuta
77,PREFACE,est_ and has condemned homer this is far from being the case the
78,PREFACE,question is still open science herself is subject to criticism and
79,PREFACE,new materials accruing yearly forbid a tame acquiescence in hasty
82,PREFACE,may i say a word to the lovers of poetry who in reading homer feel no
83,PREFACE,more doubt than in reading milton that on the whole they are studying
84,PREFACE,a work of one age by one author do not let them be driven from their
85,PREFACE,natural impression by the statement that science has decided against
86,PREFACE,them the certainties of the exact sciences are one thing the opinions
87,PREFACE,of homeric commentators are other and very different things among all
88,PREFACE,the branches of knowledge which the homeric critic should have at his
90,PREFACE,sciences and they are not exact sciences they are but skirmishing
94,PREFACE,our knowledge shifts from day to day on every hand in regard to almost
95,PREFACE,every topic discussed we find conflict of opinions there is no certain
96,PREFACE,scientific decision but there is the possibility of working in the
98,PREFACE,economy of conjecture abstinence from the piling of hypothesis on
101,PREFACE,nothing can be more hurtful to science than the dogmatic assumption that
104,PREFACE,twenty years ago the philological theory of the solar myth was preached
105,PREFACE,as scientific in the books primers and lectures of popular science
106,PREFACE,today its place knows it no more the separatist theories of the

213,THE HOMERIC AGE,the aim of this book is to prove that the homeric epics as wholes and
214,THE HOMERIC AGE,apart from passages gravely suspected in antiquity present a perfectly
215,THE HOMERIC AGE,harmonious picture of the entire life and civilisation of one single
216,THE HOMERIC AGE,age the faint variations in the design are not greater than such as
217,THE HOMERIC AGE,mark every moment of culture for in all there is some movement in all
218,THE HOMERIC AGE,cases are modified by circumstances if our contention be true it will
219,THE HOMERIC AGE,follow that the poems themselves as wholes are the product of a single
220,THE HOMERIC AGE,age not a mosaic of the work of several changeful centuries
222,THE HOMERIC AGE,this must be the caseif the life drawn is harmonious the picture
223,THE HOMERIC AGE,must be the work of a single epochfor it is not in the nature of early
224,THE HOMERIC AGE,uncritical times that later poets should adhere or even try to adhere
225,THE HOMERIC AGE,to the minute details of law custom opinion dress weapons houses
226,THE HOMERIC AGE,and so on as presented in earlier lays or sagas on the same set
227,THE HOMERIC AGE,of subjects even less are poets in uncritical times inclined to
228,THE HOMERIC AGE,archaise either by attempting to draw fancy pictures of the manners
229,THE HOMERIC AGE,of the past or by making researches in graves or among old votive
230,THE HOMERIC AGE,offerings in temples for the purpose of preserving local colour the
231,THE HOMERIC AGE,idea of such archaising is peculiar to modern times to take an instance
232,THE HOMERIC AGE,much to the point virgil was a learned poet famous for his antiquarian
233,THE HOMERIC AGE,erudition and professedly imitating and borrowing from homer now had
234,THE HOMERIC AGE,virgil worked as a man of today would work on a poem of trojan times
235,THE HOMERIC AGE,he would have represented his heroes as using weapons of bronze
236,THE HOMERIC AGE,footnote looking back at my own poem _helen of troy_ 1883 i find
237,THE HOMERIC AGE,that when the metal of a weapon is mentioned the metal is bronze no
238,THE HOMERIC AGE,such idea of archaising occurred to the learned virgil it is the iron
239,THE HOMERIC AGE,that pierces the head of remulus _aeneid_ ix 633 it is the iron
240,THE HOMERIC AGE,that waxes warm in the breast of antiphates ix 701 virgils men
241,THE HOMERIC AGE,again do not wear the great homeric shield suspended by a baldric
242,THE HOMERIC AGE,aeneas holds up his buckler _clipeus_ borne on his left arm x 26
243,THE HOMERIC AGE,i homer familiar with no buckler worn on the left arm has no such
244,THE HOMERIC AGE,description when the hostile ranks are to be broken in the _aeneid_ it
247,THE HOMERIC AGE,the most erudite ancient poet in a critical age of iron does not
248,THE HOMERIC AGE,archaise in our modern fashion he does not follow his model homer in
249,THE HOMERIC AGE,his descriptions of shields swords and spears but according to
250,THE HOMERIC AGE,most homeric critics the later continuators of the greek epics about
251,THE HOMERIC AGE,800540 bc are men living in an age of iron weapons and of round
252,THE HOMERIC AGE,bucklers worn on the left arm yet unlike virgil they always give
253,THE HOMERIC AGE,their heroes arms of bronze and unlike virgil as we shall see
254,THE HOMERIC AGE,they do not introduce the buckler worn on the left arm they adhere
255,THE HOMERIC AGE,conscientiously to the use of the vast mycenaean shield in their time
256,THE HOMERIC AGE,obsolete yet by the theory in many other respects they innovate
257,THE HOMERIC AGE,at will introducing corslets and greaves said to be unknown to the
258,THE HOMERIC AGE,beginners of the greek epics just as virgil innovates in bucklers and
259,THE HOMERIC AGE,iron weapons all this theory seems inconsistent and no ancient poet
260,THE HOMERIC AGE,not even virgil is an archaiser of the modern sort
262,THE HOMERIC AGE,all attempts to prove that the homeric poems are the work of several
263,THE HOMERIC AGE,centuries appear to rest on a double hypothesis first that the later
264,THE HOMERIC AGE,contributors to the _iliad_ kept a steady eye on the traditions of the
265,THE HOMERIC AGE,remote achaean age of bronze next that they innovated as much as they
268,THE HOMERIC AGE,poets of an uncritical age do not archaise this rule is overlooked by
269,THE HOMERIC AGE,the critics who represent the homeric poems as a complex of the work of
270,THE HOMERIC AGE,many singers in many ages for example professor percy gardner in his
271,THE HOMERIC AGE,very interesting _new chapters in greek history_ 1892 carries neglect
272,THE HOMERIC AGE,of the rule so far as to suppose that the late homeric poets being
273,THE HOMERIC AGE,aware that the ancient heroes could not ride or write or eat boiled
274,THE HOMERIC AGE,meat consciously and purposefully represented them as doing none of
275,THE HOMERIC AGE,these things this they did on the same principle on which a writer of
276,THE HOMERIC AGE,pastoral idylls in our own day would avoid the mention of the telegraph
277,THE HOMERIC AGE,or telephone footnote _op cit_ p 142 a writer of our own
278,THE HOMERIC AGE,daythere is the pervading fallacy it is only writers of the last
280,THE HOMERIC AGE,_beowulf_ and the _nibelungenlied_ of the chansons de _geste_ and of
281,THE HOMERIC AGE,the arthurian romances always describe their antique heroes and the
282,THE HOMERIC AGE,details of their life in conformity with the customs costume and
285,THE HOMERIC AGE,but mr leaf to take another instance remarks as to the lack of the
286,THE HOMERIC AGE,metal lead in the epics that it is mentioned in similes only as though
287,THE HOMERIC AGE,the poet were aware the metal was unknown in the heroic age footnote
288,THE HOMERIC AGE,_iliad_ note on xi 237 here the poet is assumed to be a careful
290,THE HOMERIC AGE,representation of the past lead in fact was perfectly familiar to the
291,THE HOMERIC AGE,mycenaean prime footnote tsountas and manatt p 73 the critical
292,THE HOMERIC AGE,usage of supposing that the ancients were like the most recent
294,THE HOMERIC AGE,uncritical habit which invariably beset old poets and artists ancient
295,THE HOMERIC AGE,poets of the uncritical ages never worked on the same principle as a
296,THE HOMERIC AGE,writer in our day as regards archaeological precision at least we are
299,THE HOMERIC AGE,let us take another instance of the critical fallacy the age of the
300,THE HOMERIC AGE,achaean warriors who dwelt in the glorious halls of mycenae was
301,THE HOMERIC AGE,followed at an interval by the age represented in the relics found in
302,THE HOMERIC AGE,the older tombs outside the dipylon gate of athens an age beginning
303,THE HOMERIC AGE,probably about 900850 bc the culture of this dipylon age a
304,THE HOMERIC AGE,time of geometrical ornaments on vases and of human figures drawn in
305,THE HOMERIC AGE,geometrical forms lines and triangles was quite unlike that of the
306,THE HOMERIC AGE,achaean age in many ways for example in mode of burial and in the use
307,THE HOMERIC AGE,of iron for weapons mr h r hall in his learned book _the oldest
308,THE HOMERIC AGE,civilisation of greece_ 1901 supposes the culture described in the
309,THE HOMERIC AGE,homeric poems to be contemporary in asia with that of this dipylon
310,THE HOMERIC AGE,period in greece footnote op cit pp 49 222 he says the
311,THE HOMERIC AGE,homeric culture is evidently the culture of the poets own days there
312,THE HOMERIC AGE,is no attempt to archaise here they do not archaise as to the
313,THE HOMERIC AGE,details of life but the homeric poets consciously and consistently
314,THE HOMERIC AGE,archaised in regard to the political conditions of continental greece
315,THE HOMERIC AGE,in the achaean times they give in all probability a pretty accurate
316,THE HOMERIC AGE,description of the loose feudalism of mycenaean greece footnote op
319,THE HOMERIC AGE,we shall later show that this homeric picture of a past political and
320,THE HOMERIC AGE,social condition of greece is of vivid and delicate accuracy that it
321,THE HOMERIC AGE,is drawn from the life not constructed out of historical materials mr
322,THE HOMERIC AGE,hall explains the fact by the conscious and consistent archaeological
323,THE HOMERIC AGE,precision of the asiatic poets of the ninth century now to any one
324,THE HOMERIC AGE,who knows early national poetry early uncritical art of any kind
325,THE HOMERIC AGE,this theory seems not easily tenable the difficulty of the theory is
326,THE HOMERIC AGE,increased if we suppose that the achaeans were the recent conquerors
327,THE HOMERIC AGE,of the mycenaeans whether we regard the achaeans as celts with mr
328,THE HOMERIC AGE,ridgeway victors over an aryan people the pelasgic mycenaeans or
329,THE HOMERIC AGE,whether with mr hall we think that the achaeans were the aryan
330,THE HOMERIC AGE,conquerors of a nonaryan people the makers of the mycenaean
331,THE HOMERIC AGE,civilisation in the stress of a conquest followed at no long interval
332,THE HOMERIC AGE,by an expulsion at the hands of dorian invaders there would be little
333,THE HOMERIC AGE,thought of archaising among achaean poets footnote mr hall informs
334,THE HOMERIC AGE,me that he no longer holds the opinion that the poets archaised
336,THE HOMERIC AGE,a distinction has been made it is true between the poet and other
338,THE HOMERIC AGE,reproduces what he sees while the epic poets endeavoured to represent
339,THE HOMERIC AGE,a distant past if homer gives swords of bronze to his heroes of times
340,THE HOMERIC AGE,gone by it is because he knows that such were the weapons of these
341,THE HOMERIC AGE,heroes of long ago in arming them with bronze he makes use in his
342,THE HOMERIC AGE,way of what we call local colour thus the homeric poet is a more
346,THE HOMERIC AGE,now we contend that old uncritical poets no more sought for antique
347,THE HOMERIC AGE,local colour than any other artists did m perrot himself says with
348,THE HOMERIC AGE,truth the _chanson de roland_ and all the _gestes_ of the same cycle
349,THE HOMERIC AGE,explain for us the iliad and the odyssey footnote op cit p 5
350,THE HOMERIC AGE,but the poet of the _chanson de roland_ accoutres his heroes of old time
351,THE HOMERIC AGE,in the costume and armour of his own age and the later poets of the
352,THE HOMERIC AGE,same cycle introduce the innovations of their time they do not hunt for
353,THE HOMERIC AGE,local colour in the _chanson de roland_ the very words local colour
354,THE HOMERIC AGE,are a modern phrase for an idea that never occurred to the artists of
355,THE HOMERIC AGE,ancient uncritical ages the homeric poets like the painters of the
356,THE HOMERIC AGE,dipylon period describe the details of life as they see them with their
357,THE HOMERIC AGE,own eyes such poets and artists never have the fear of anachronisms
358,THE HOMERIC AGE,before them this indeed is plain to the critics themselves for
359,THE HOMERIC AGE,they detect anachronisms as to land tenure burial the construction
360,THE HOMERIC AGE,of houses marriage customs weapons and armour in the _iliad_ and
361,THE HOMERIC AGE,_odyssey_ these supposed anachronisms we examine later if they really
362,THE HOMERIC AGE,exist they show that the poets were indifferent to local colour
364,THE HOMERIC AGE,archaeological accuracy in fact such artistic revival of the past in
365,THE HOMERIC AGE,its habit as it lived is a purely modern ideal
367,THE HOMERIC AGE,we are to show then that the epics being as wholes free from such
368,THE HOMERIC AGE,inevitable modifications in the picture of changing details of life as
369,THE HOMERIC AGE,uncritical authors always introduce are the work of the one age which
370,THE HOMERIC AGE,they represent this is the reverse of what has long been and still is
371,THE HOMERIC AGE,the current theory of homeric criticism according to which the homeric
372,THE HOMERIC AGE,poems are and bear manifest marks of being a mosaic of the poetry of
375,THE HOMERIC AGE,till wolf published his _prolegomena_ to blank space 1795 there was
376,THE HOMERIC AGE,little opposition to the old belief that the _iliad_ and odyssey were
377,THE HOMERIC AGE,allowing for interpolations the work of one or at most of two poets
378,THE HOMERIC AGE,after the appearance of wolfs celebrated book homeric critics have
379,THE HOMERIC AGE,maintained generally speaking that the _iliad_ is either a collection
380,THE HOMERIC AGE,of short lays disposed in sequence in a late age or that it contains an
382,THE HOMERIC AGE,some centuries of changeful life have accrued and have been at last
385,THE HOMERIC AGE,the latter theory is now dominant it is maintained that the _iliad_ is
386,THE HOMERIC AGE,a work of at least four centuries some of the objections to this theory
387,THE HOMERIC AGE,were obvious to wolf himselfmore obvious to him than to his followers
388,THE HOMERIC AGE,he was aware and some of them are not of the distinction between
389,THE HOMERIC AGE,reading the _iliad_ as all poetic literature is naturally read and by
390,THE HOMERIC AGE,all authors is meant to be read for human pleasure and studying it in
391,THE HOMERIC AGE,the spirit of the analytical reader as often as he read for pleasure
393,THE HOMERIC AGE,he invented for homer as often as he yielded himself to that running
394,THE HOMERIC AGE,stream of action and narration as often as he considered the _harmony_
395,THE HOMERIC AGE,of _colour_ and of characters in the epic no man could be more angry
396,THE HOMERIC AGE,with his own destructive criticism than himself wolf ceased to be a
397,THE HOMERIC AGE,wolfian whenever he placed himself at the point of view of the reader or
398,THE HOMERIC AGE,the listener to whom alone every poet makes his appeal
400,THE HOMERIC AGE,but he deemed it his duty to place himself at another point of view
401,THE HOMERIC AGE,that of the scientific literary historian the historian of a period
402,THE HOMERIC AGE,concerning whose history he could know nothing how could the thing
403,THE HOMERIC AGE,be possible he asked himself how could a long poem like the _iliad_
405,THE HOMERIC AGE,place in paragraph unknown preface to homer p xxii 1794 wolf was
406,THE HOMERIC AGE,unaware that he did not know what the historical circumstances were we
407,THE HOMERIC AGE,know how little we know but we do know more than wolf he invented the
408,THE HOMERIC AGE,historical circumstances of the supposed poet they were he said like
409,THE HOMERIC AGE,those of a man who should build a large ship in an inland place with no
410,THE HOMERIC AGE,sea to launch it upon the _iliad_ was the large ship the sea was the
411,THE HOMERIC AGE,public homer could have no _readers_ wolf said in an age that like
412,THE HOMERIC AGE,the old hermit of prague never saw pen and ink had no knowledge
413,THE HOMERIC AGE,of letters or if letters were dimly known had never applied them
414,THE HOMERIC AGE,to literature in such circumstances no man could have a motive for
415,THE HOMERIC AGE,composing a long poem footnote _prolegomena to the iliad_ p xxvi
417,THE HOMERIC AGE,yet if the original poet homer could make the greater part of the
418,THE HOMERIC AGE,songs as wolf admitted what physical impossibility stood in the way
419,THE HOMERIC AGE,of his making the whole meanwhile the historical circumstances as
420,THE HOMERIC AGE,conceived of by wolf were imaginary he did not take the circumstances
421,THE HOMERIC AGE,of the poet as described in the odyssey here a king or prince has a
422,THE HOMERIC AGE,minstrel honoured as were the minstrels described in the ancient irish
423,THE HOMERIC AGE,books of law his duty is to entertain the prince and his family and
424,THE HOMERIC AGE,guests by singing epic chants after supper and there is no reason why
425,THE HOMERIC AGE,his poetic narratives should be brief but rather he has an opportunity
426,THE HOMERIC AGE,that never occurred again till the literary age of greece for producing
427,THE HOMERIC AGE,a long poem continued from night to night in the later age in the
428,THE HOMERIC AGE,asiatic colonies and in greece the rhapsodists competing for prizes at
429,THE HOMERIC AGE,feasts or reciting to a civic crowd were limited in time and gave but
430,THE HOMERIC AGE,snatches of poetry it is in this later civic age that a poet without
431,THE HOMERIC AGE,readers would have little motive for building wolfs great ship of song
432,THE HOMERIC AGE,and scant chance of launching it to any profitable purpose to this
433,THE HOMERIC AGE,point we return but when once critics following wolf had convinced
434,THE HOMERIC AGE,themselves that a long early poem was impossible they soon found
437,THE HOMERIC AGE,they have discovered discrepancies of which they say no one sane poet
438,THE HOMERIC AGE,could have been guilty they have also discovered that the poems had
439,THE HOMERIC AGE,not as wolf declared one harmony of colour _unus color_ each
440,THE HOMERIC AGE,age they say during which the poems were continued lent its own
441,THE HOMERIC AGE,colour the poets by their theory now preserved the genuine tradition
442,THE HOMERIC AGE,of things old cremation cairn and urn burial the use of the chariot
443,THE HOMERIC AGE,in war the use of bronze for weapons a peculiar stage of customary
444,THE HOMERIC AGE,law a peculiar form of semifeudal society a peculiar kind of house
445,THE HOMERIC AGE,but again by a change in the theory the poets introduced later
446,THE HOMERIC AGE,novelties later forms of defensive armour later modes of burial later
447,THE HOMERIC AGE,religious and speculative beliefs a later style of house an advanced
450,THE HOMERIC AGE,the usual position of critics in this matter is stated by helbig and
451,THE HOMERIC AGE,we are to contend that the theory is contradicted by all experience of
452,THE HOMERIC AGE,ancient literatures and is in itself the reverse of consistent the
453,THE HOMERIC AGE,_artists_ of antiquity says helbig with perfect truth had no idea
455,THE HOMERIC AGE,conformity with the spirit of their own age and reproduced the arms and
456,THE HOMERIC AGE,implements and costume that they saw around them footnote _lépopée
459,THE HOMERIC AGE,now a poet is an _artist_ like another and he toono less than the
460,THE HOMERIC AGE,vase painter or engraver of gemsin dealing with legends of times past
461,THE HOMERIC AGE,represents in an uncritical age the arms utensils costume and the
462,THE HOMERIC AGE,religious geographical legal social and political ideas of his own
463,THE HOMERIC AGE,period we shall later prove that this is true by examples from the
466,THE HOMERIC AGE,it follows that if the _iliad_ is absolutely consistent and harmonious
467,THE HOMERIC AGE,in its picture of life and of all the accessories of life the _iliad_
468,THE HOMERIC AGE,is the work of a single age of a single stage of culture the poet
469,THE HOMERIC AGE,describing his own environment but helbig on the other hand citing
471,THE HOMERIC AGE,centuries he saysmaintains its unity of colour by virtue of
473,THE HOMERIC AGE,untersuchungen_ p 292 _homerische epos_ p i if so the poets must
474,THE HOMERIC AGE,have archaeologised must have kept asking themselves is this or that
475,THE HOMERIC AGE,detail true to the past which artists in uncritical ages never do
476,THE HOMERIC AGE,as we have been told by helbig they must have carefully pondered the
477,THE HOMERIC AGE,surviving old achaean lays which were born when the heroes could
478,THE HOMERIC AGE,not read or boil flesh or back a steed by carefully observing the
479,THE HOMERIC AGE,earliest lays the late poets in times of changed manners could avoid
480,THE HOMERIC AGE,anachronisms by the aid of tradition which gave them a very exact idea
481,THE HOMERIC AGE,of the epic heroes such is the opinion of wilamowitz moellendorff he
482,THE HOMERIC AGE,appears to regard the tradition as keeping the later poets in the old
483,THE HOMERIC AGE,way automatically not consciously but this we also learn from helbig
484,THE HOMERIC AGE,did not occur the poets often wandered from the way footnote helbig
485,THE HOMERIC AGE,_homerische epos_ pp 2 3 thus old mycenaean lays if any existed
486,THE HOMERIC AGE,would describe the old mycenaean mode of burial the homeric poet
487,THE HOMERIC AGE,describes something radically different we vainly ask for proof that
488,THE HOMERIC AGE,in any early national literature known to us poets have been true to the
489,THE HOMERIC AGE,colour and manners of the remote times in which their heroes moved
490,THE HOMERIC AGE,and of which old minstrels sang the thing is without example of this
493,THE HOMERIC AGE,meanwhile the whole theory which regards the _iliad_ as the work of
494,THE HOMERIC AGE,four or five centuries rests on the postulate that poets throughout
495,THE HOMERIC AGE,these centuries did what such poets never do kept true to the details
496,THE HOMERIC AGE,of a life remote from their own and also did not
498,THE HOMERIC AGE,for helbig does not after all cleave to his opinion on the other
499,THE HOMERIC AGE,hand he says that the later poets of the _iliad_ did not cling to

504,THE HOMERIC AGE,into the oldest parts of the epic footnote _homerische epos_ p 2
506,THE HOMERIC AGE,at this point comes in a complex inconsistency the tenth book of the
507,THE HOMERIC AGE,_iliad_ thinks helbigin common with almost all criticsis one of
508,THE HOMERIC AGE,the most recent lays of the _iliad_ but in this recent lay say of
509,THE HOMERIC AGE,the eighth or seventh century the poet describes the thracians as on
510,THE HOMERIC AGE,a level of civilisation with the achaeans and indeed as even more
511,THE HOMERIC AGE,luxurious wealthy and refined in the matter of good horses glorious
512,THE HOMERIC AGE,armour and splendid chariots but by the time of the persian
513,THE HOMERIC AGE,wars says helbig the thracians were regarded by the greeks as rude
514,THE HOMERIC AGE,barbarians and their military equipment was totally ungreek they did
515,THE HOMERIC AGE,not wear helmets but caps of foxskin they had no body armour their
516,THE HOMERIC AGE,shields were small round bucklers their weapons were bows and daggers
517,THE HOMERIC AGE,these customs could not at the time of the persian wars be recent
520,THE HOMERIC AGE,had the poet of _iliad_ book x known the thracians in _this_
521,THE HOMERIC AGE,condition says helbig as he was fond of details of costume and arms
522,THE HOMERIC AGE,he would have certainly described their foxskin caps bows bucklers
523,THE HOMERIC AGE,and so forth he would not here have followed the epic tradition which
524,THE HOMERIC AGE,represented the thracians as makers of great swords and as splendidly
525,THE HOMERIC AGE,armed charioteers his audience had met the thracians in peace and war
526,THE HOMERIC AGE,and would contradict the poets description of them as heavily armed
527,THE HOMERIC AGE,charioteers it follows therefore that the latest poets such as the
528,THE HOMERIC AGE,author of book x did not introduce recent details those of their
529,THE HOMERIC AGE,own time but we have just previously been told that to do so was their
532,THE HOMERIC AGE,now studniczka footnote _homerische epos pp 711 cf_ note i
533,THE HOMERIC AGE,_zeitschrift fur die oestern gymnasien_ 1886 p 195 explains the
534,THE HOMERIC AGE,picture of the thracians in _iliad_ book x on helbigs _other_
535,THE HOMERIC AGE,principle namely that the very late author of the tenth book merely
536,THE HOMERIC AGE,conforms to the conventional tradition of the epic adheres to the model
537,THE HOMERIC AGE,set in ancient achaean or rather ancient ionian times and scrupulously
538,THE HOMERIC AGE,preserved by the latest poetsthat is when the latest poets do not
539,THE HOMERIC AGE,bring in the new details of their own age but helbig will not accept
540,THE HOMERIC AGE,his own theory in this case whence does it follow that the author of
541,THE HOMERIC AGE,the tenth book must in his opinion have lived in achaean times and
542,THE HOMERIC AGE,described the thracians as they then were charioteers heavily armed
543,THE HOMERIC AGE,not lightclad archers if this is so we ask how helbig can aver that
544,THE HOMERIC AGE,the tenth book is one of the latest parts of the _iliad_
546,THE HOMERIC AGE,in studying the critics who hold that the _iliad_ is the growth of
547,THE HOMERIC AGE,four centuriessay from the eleventh to the seventh century bcno
548,THE HOMERIC AGE,consistency is to be discovered the earth is never solid beneath our
549,THE HOMERIC AGE,feet we find now that the poets are true to tradition in the details of
550,THE HOMERIC AGE,ancient lifenow that the poets introduce whatever modern details they
551,THE HOMERIC AGE,please the late poets have now a very exact knowledge of the past now
552,THE HOMERIC AGE,the late poets know nothing about the past or again some of the poets
553,THE HOMERIC AGE,are fond of actual and very minute archaeological research the theory
554,THE HOMERIC AGE,shifts its position as may suit the point to be made at the moment by
555,THE HOMERIC AGE,the critic all is arbitrary and it is certain that logic demands a
556,THE HOMERIC AGE,very different method of inquiry if helbig and other critics of his
557,THE HOMERIC AGE,way of thinking mean that in the _iliad_ 1 there are parts of genuine
558,THE HOMERIC AGE,antiquity other parts 2 by poets who with stern accuracy copied the
559,THE HOMERIC AGE,old modes other parts 3 by poets who tried to copy but failed with
560,THE HOMERIC AGE,passages 4 by poets who deliberately innovated and passages 5
561,THE HOMERIC AGE,by poets who drew fanciful pictures of the past from their inner
563,THE HOMERIC AGE,researches and if the argument be that the critics can detect these six
564,THE HOMERIC AGE,elements then we are asked to repose unlimited confidence in critical
568,THE HOMERIC AGE,it is our effort then in the following pages to show that the _unus_
569,THE HOMERIC AGE,color of wolf does pervade the epics that recent details are not often
571,THE HOMERIC AGE,age and that a brief age of culture that this effect cannot in
572,THE HOMERIC AGE,a thoroughly uncritical period have been deliberately aimed at and
573,THE HOMERIC AGE,produced by archaeological learning or by sedulous copying of poetic
574,THE HOMERIC AGE,tradition or by the scientific labours of an editor of the sixth
575,THE HOMERIC AGE,century bc we shall endeavour to prove what we have already
577,THE HOMERIC AGE,or in accordance with what is known of the evolution of early national
578,THE HOMERIC AGE,poetry the strongest part perhaps of our argument is to rest on our
580,THE HOMERIC AGE,neglect the more disputable or less convincing contentions of literary
591,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,a theorist who believes that the homeric poems are the growth of four
592,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,changeful centuries must present a definite working hypothesis as to
593,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,how they escaped from certain influences of the late age in which much
594,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,of them is said to have been composed we must first ask to what manner

606,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,leaf however would not express them with regard to our _iliad_ and
607,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,odyssey because in his view a considerable part of the _iliad_ as
608,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,it stands was made not by court bards in the achaean courts of europe
609,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,not for an audience of noble warriors and dames but by wandering

617,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,amused the holidays of a commercial expansive and bustling ionian
620,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,we must suppose that on this theory the later poets pleased a
621,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,commercial democracy by keeping up the tone that had delighted an old
622,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,landowning military aristocracy it is not difficult however to admit
623,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,this as possible for the poems continued to be admired in all ages of
624,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,greece and under every form of society the real question is would the
625,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,modern poets be the men to keep up a tone some four or five centuries
626,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,old and to be true if they were true to the details of the heroic
627,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,age it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that some part of the
628,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,most primitive _iliad_ may have been actually sung by the court minstrel

670,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,them these rose to the surface with the rest of the marvellous ionic
671,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,genius and many an ancient survival was enshrined in the literature
672,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,or mythology of athens which had long passed out of all remembrance at

677,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,into the iliad which they continued by the theory such phases of
678,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,belief were indeed by their time popular and frequently appeared in
679,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the cyclic poems on the trojan war continuations of the _iliad_ which
680,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,were composed by ionian authors at the same time as much of the _iliad_

684,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,_cf_ monro _the cyclic poets odyssey_ vol ii pp 342384 they
685,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,had ideas very different from those of the authors of the _iliad_ and
688,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,helbig states this curious fact that the homeric poems are free from
689,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,many recent or recrudescent ideas common in other epics composed during
690,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the later centuries of the supposed four hundred years of epic growth
691,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,footnote _homerische epos_ p 3 thus a signet ring was mentioned
692,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,in the _ilias puma_ and there are no rings in _iliad_ or _odyssey_
693,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,but helbig does not perceive the insuperable difficulty which here
694,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,encounters his hypothesis he remarks in certain poems which were
695,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,grouping themselves around the _iliad and _odyssey we meet data
696,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,absolutely opposed to the conventional style of the epic he gives
697,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,three or four examples of perfectly unhomeric ideas occurring in epics
698,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,of the eighth to seventh centuries bc and a large supply of such
699,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,cases can be adduced but helbig does not ask how it happened that if
700,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,poets of these centuries had lost touch with the epic tradition and had
701,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,wandered into a new region of thought as they had examples of their
702,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,notions do not occur in the _iliad_ and _odyssey_ by his theory these
703,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,poems were being added to and altered even in their oldest portions
704,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,at the very period when strange fresh or old and newly revived fancies
705,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,were flourishing if so how were the _iliad_ and _odyssey_ unlike the
706,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,cyclic poems kept uncontaminated as they confessedly were by the new
709,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,here is the real difficulty cyclic poets of the eighth and seventh
710,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,centuries had certainly lost touch with the epic tradition their poems
711,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,make that an admitted fact yet poets of the eighth to seventh centuries
712,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,were by the theory busily adding to and altering the ancient lays of
713,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the _iliad_ how did _they_ abstain from the new or revived ideas and
714,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,from the new _genre_ of romance are we to believe that one set of late
715,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,ionian poetsthey who added to and altered the iliadwere true
716,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,to tradition while another contemporary set of ionian poets the

718,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,lost touch with the homeric taste religion and ritual the reply will
719,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,perhaps be a cyclic poet said here i am going to compose quite a new
720,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,poem about the old heroes i shall make them do and think and believe as
721,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,i please without reference to the evidence of the old poems but it
722,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,will have to be added the rhapsodists of 800540 bc and the general
723,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,editor of the latter date thought _we_ are continuing an old set of
724,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,lays and we must be very careful in adhering to manners customs and
725,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,beliefs as described by our predecessors for instance the old heroes
726,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,had only bronze no ironand then the rhapsodists forgot and made
727,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,iron a common commodity in the _iliad_ again the rhapsodists knew that
728,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the ancient heroes had no corsletsthe old lays we learn never
729,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,spoke of corsletsbut they made them wear corslets of much splendour
730,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,footnote the reader must remember that the view of the late poets
731,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,as careful adherents of tradition in usages and ideas only obtains
733,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,is _not_ preserved and that the ionic continuators introduced for
734,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,example the military gear of their own period into a poem which
735,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,represents much older weapons and equipments this theory does not help

810,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,keep their modern ionian ideas or their primitive recrudescent phases
811,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,of belief out of their lays as far as they _did_ keep them out while
812,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the contemporary authors of the _cypria_ _the sack of ilios_ and other
813,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,cyclic poets were full of new ideas legends and beliefs or primitive
814,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,notions revived and save when revived quite obviously late and quite
817,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the difficulty is the greater if the cyclic poems were long poems with
818,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,one author to each epic such authors were obviously men of ambition
819,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,they produced serious works _de longue haleine_ it is from them that
820,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,we should naturally expect conservative and studious adhesion to the
822,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,chanters at festivals we look for nothing of the sort _they_ might be
823,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,expected to introduce great feats done by sergeants and privates so to
824,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,speakmen of the nameless greek laos the host the foot menwho
825,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,in homer are occasionally said to perish of disease or to fall under the
826,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,rain of arrows but are never distinguished by name the strollers it
827,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,might be thought would also be the very men to introduce fairy tales
828,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,freaks of primitive ionian myth discreditable anecdotes of the princely
831,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,but it is not so the serious laborious authors of the long cyclic
832,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,poems do such unhomeric things as these the gay irresponsible
833,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,strolling singers of a lay here and a lay therelays now incorporated
834,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,in the _iliad_ and _odyssey_scrupulously avoid such faults they never
835,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,even introduce a signet ring these are difficulties in the theory of
836,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the _iliad_ as a patchwork by many hands in many ages which nobody
837,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,explains which indeed nobody seems to find difficult yet the
838,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,difficulty is insuperable even if we take refuge with wilamowitz in the
839,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,idea that the cyclic and homeric poems were at first mere protoplasm
840,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,of lays of many ages and that they were all compiled say in the sixth
841,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,century into so many narratives we come no nearer to explaining
842,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,why the tone taste and ideas of two such narrativesilliad and
843,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,odysseyare confessedly distinct from the tone taste and ideas of all
844,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the others the cyclic poems are certainly the production of a late and
845,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,changed age footnote for what manner of audience if not for readers
846,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,the cyclic poems were composed is a mysterious question the _iliad_ is
847,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,not in any degreesave perhaps in a few interpolated passagestouched
848,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,by the influences of that late age it is not a complex of the work
849,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,of four incompatible centuries as far as this point is concernedthe
850,HYPOTHESES AS TO THE GROWTH OF THE EPICS,point of legend religion ritual and conception of heroic character
860,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,whosoever holds that the homeric poems were evolved out of the lays of
861,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,many men in many places during many periods of culture must present a
862,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,consistent and logical hypothesis as to how they attained their present
863,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,plots and forms these could not come by accident even if the plots
864,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,are not goodas all the world held that they were till after wolfs
865,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,daybut very bad as some critics now assert still plot and form
866,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,beyond the power of chance to produce the poems do possess nobody goes
867,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,so far as to deny that and critics make hypotheses explanatory of
868,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the fact that a single ancient kernel of some 2500 lines a kernel
869,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,altered at will by any one who pleased during four centuries became a
870,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,constructive whole if the hypotheses fail to account for the fact we
871,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,have the more reason to believe that the poems are the work of one age
874,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in criticising homeric criticism as it is today we cannot do better
875,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,than begin by examining the theories of mr leaf which are offered by
876,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,him merely as a working hypothesis his most erudite work is based on
877,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,a wide knowledge of german homeric speculation of the exact science of
879,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the iliad macmillan  co 1900 1902 his volumes are i doubt not as
880,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,they certainly deserve to be on the shelves of every homeric student
881,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,old or young and doubtless their contents reach the higher forms in
882,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,schools though there is reason to suppose that about the unity of
885,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in this book of more than 1200 pages mr leafs space is mainly
886,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,devoted to textual criticism philology and pure scholarship but his
887,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,introductions notes and appendices also set forth his mature ideas
888,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,about the homeric problem in general he has altered some of his
889,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,opinions since the publication of his _companion to the iliad_1892
890,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,but the main lines of his old system are except on one crucial point
891,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,unchanged his theory we shall try to state and criticise in general
892,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,outline it is the current theory of separatist critics and it may
893,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,fairly be treated as a good example of such theories
895,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the system is to the following effect greek tradition in the classical
896,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,period regarded the _iliad_ and _odyssey_ as the work of one man
897,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,homer a native of one or other of the ionian colonies of asia minor
898,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,but the poems show few obvious signs of origin in asia they deal with
899,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,dwellers before the dorian invasion which the poet never alludes to
900,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,on the continent of europe and in crete footnote if the poet sang
901,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,after the tempest of war that came down with the dorians from the
902,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,north he would probably have sought a topic in the achaean exploits and
903,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,sorrows of that period the dorians not the trojans would have been
904,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the foes the epics of france of the eleventh and twelfth centuries
905,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,dwell not on the real victories of the remote charlemagne so much as
906,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,on the disasters of aliscans and roncesvauxdefeats at saracen hands
907,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,saracens being the enemies of the twelfthcentury poets no saracens
908,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in fact fought at roncesvaux the lays are concerned with good old
909,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,times presumably between 1500 and 1100 bc their pictures of the
910,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,details of life harmonise more with what we know of the society of that
911,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,period from the evidence of buildings and recent excavations than with
912,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,what we know of the life and the much more rude and barbaric art of the
914,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in the dipylon age though the use of iron even for swords made on the
915,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,lines of the old bronze sword was familiar art was on a most barbaric
916,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,level not much above the bed indian type as far at least as painted
917,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,vases bear witness the human figure is designed as in tommy traddless
918,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,skeletons there is however some crude but promising idea of
921,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the picture of life in the homeric poems then is more like that of
922,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,say 15001100 bc than of say 1000850 bc in mr leafs opinion
924,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,overlord who rules by right divine from golden mycenae we hear of
925,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,no such potentate in ionia homers accounts of contemporary art seem to
926,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,be inspired by the rich art generally dated about 15001200 yet there
927,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,are many traces of apparent anachronism of divergence from the more
928,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,antique picture of life in these divergences are we to recognise the
929,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,picture of a later development of the ancient existence of 15001200
930,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,bc or have elements of the life of a much later age of greece say
931,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,800550 bc been consciously or unconsciously introduced by the late
932,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,poets here mr leaf recognises a point on which we have insisted
933,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and must keep insisting for it is of the first importance it is _a
934,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,priori_ the most probable supposition that in an uncritical age
935,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,poets do _not_ reproduce the circumstances of the old time but
936,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,only clothe the old tale in the garb of their own days poets in an
937,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,uncritical age always in our experience clothe old tales with the
938,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,garb of their own time but mr leaf thinks that in the case of the
939,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,homeric poems this idea is not wholly borne out by the facts
941,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in fact mr leafs hypothesis like helbigs exhibits a comeandgo
942,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,between the theory that his late poets clung close to tradition and so
943,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,kept true to ancient details of life and the theory that they did quite
944,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the reverse in many cases of this frequent examples will occur he
945,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,writes the homeric period is certainly later than the shaft tombs
946,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,discovered at mycenae by dr schliemann but it does not necessarily
947,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,follow that it is postmycenaean it is quite possible that certain
948,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,notable differences between the poems and the monuments of mycenae
949,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in burial for instance and in womens dress may be due to changes
950,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,which arose within the mycenaean age itself in that later part of it
951,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of which our knowledge is defectivealmost as defective as it is of
952,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the subsequent dipylon period on the whole the resemblance to
953,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the typical mycenaean culture is more striking than the difference
956,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,so far mr leaf states precisely the opinion for which we argue the
957,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,homeric poems describe an age later than that of the famous tombsso
958,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,rich in relicsof the mycenaean acropolis and earlier than the tombs
959,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of the dipylon of athens the poems thus spring out of an age of which
960,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,except from the poems themselves we know little or nothing because
961,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,as is shown later no cairn burials answering to the frequent homeric
963,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,descriptions are to seek but the age attaches itself in many ways to
964,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the age of the mycenaean tombs while in our opinion it stands quite
967,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,where we differ from mr leaf is in believing that the poems as wholes
968,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,were composed in that late mycenaean period of which from material
969,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,remains we know very little that much new was not added as he
970,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,thinks in the ionian development which lasted perhaps from the ninth
971,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,century bc to the seventh we cannot agree with mr leaf when he
972,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,like helbig thinks that much of the detail of the ancient life in the
973,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,poems had early become so stereotyped that no continuator however
974,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,late dared intentionally to sap the type though he slipped from
975,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,time to time into involuntary anachronism some poets are also asserted
976,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,to indulge in _voluntary_ anachronism when as mr leaf supposes they
977,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,equip the ancient warriors with corslets and greaves and other body
978,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,armour of bronze such as in his opinion the old heroes never knew
979,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,such as never were mentioned in the oldest parts or kernel of the
980,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,poems thus the traditional details of mycenaean life sometimes are
981,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,regarded as stereotyped in poetic tradition sometimes as subject to
984,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,as to deliberate adherence to tradition by the poets we have proved
985,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,that the cyclic epic poets of 800660 bc wandered widely from the
986,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,ancient models if then every minstrel or rhapsodist who anywhere
987,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,added at will to the old kernel of the _achilles_ was so far as he
989,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,details as mr leaf sometimes supposes the fact is contrary to general
990,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,custom in such cases when later poets in an uncritical age take up and
991,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,rehandle the poetic themes of their predecessors they always give to
992,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the stories a new costume as m gaston paris remarks in reference to
993,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,thirteenth century dealings with french epics of the eleventh century
994,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,but in the critics opinion the late rehandlers of old achaean lays
995,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,preserved the archaic modes of life war costume weapons and
996,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,so forth with conscientious care except in certain matters to be
997,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,considered later when they deliberately did the very reverse sometimes
1000,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,but by their time forgotten mycenaean things and criticism can detect
1003,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,though the late continuators of the _iliad_ were able despite
1004,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,certain inadvertencies to keep up for some four centuries in asia
1005,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the harmonious picture of ancient achaean life and society in europe
1006,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,critics can distinguish four separate strata the work of many different
1007,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,ages in the _iliad_ of the first stratum composed in europe say about
1008,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,13001150 bc i give a conjectural date under all reserves the topic
1009,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,was _the wrath of achilles_ of this poem in mr leafs opinion a
1010,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the first book and fifty lines of the second book remain intact or
1011,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,perhaps are a blend of two versions b the _valour of agamemnon_ and
1012,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,_defeat of the achaeans_ of this there are portions in book xi but
1013,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,they were meddled with altered and generally doctored down to the
1014,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,latest period namely the age of pisistratus in athens the middle of
1015,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the sixth century bc c the fight in which after their defeat the
1016,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,achaeans try to save the ships from the torch of hector and the _valour
1017,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of patroclus_ but some critics do not accept this with his death
1018,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,xv xvi in parts d some eighty lines on the _arming of achilles_
1019,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,xix e perhaps an incident or two in books xx xxi f the
1020,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,_slaying hector_ by achilles in books xxi xxii but some of the learned
1021,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,will not admit this and we shall unhappily have to prove that if mr
1022,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,leafs principles be correct we really know nothing about the _slaying
1025,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of these six elements only did the original poem consist mr leaf
1026,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,thinks a rigid critic will reject as original even the _valour of
1027,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,patroclus_ and the _death of hector_ but mr leaf refuses to go so far
1028,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,as that the original poem as detected by him is really the work of
1029,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,a single poet perhaps the greatest in all the worlds history if the
1030,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,original poet did no more than is here allotted to him especially if he
1031,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,left out the purpose of zeus and the person of thetis in book i we
1032,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,do not quite understand his unapproachable greatness he must certainly
1033,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,have drawn a rather commonplace achilles as we shall see and we
1036,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the brief narrative cut out of the mass by mr leaf then was the
1037,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,genuine old original poem or kernel what we commonly call the
1038,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,_iliad_ on the other hand is by his theory a thing of shreds and
1039,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,patches combined in a manner to be later described the blend
1040,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,we learn has none of the masterly unity of the old original poem
1041,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,meanwhile as criticism of literary composition is a purely literary
1042,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,question critics who differ from mr leaf have a right to hold that
1043,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the _iliad_ as it stands contains and always did contain a plot of
1044,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,masterly perfection we need not attend here so closely to mr leafs
1045,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,theory in the matter of the first expansions 2 and the second
1046,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,expansions 3 but the latest expansions 4 give the account of _the
1048,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,ix the blank space book xxiv the _reconciliation of achilles
1049,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and agamemnon and the funeral games_ of _patroclus_ xxiii in all
1050,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,these parts of the poem there are we learn countless alterations
1052,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,passages the work of the editor inspired by the statesman that is
1053,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of an hypothetical editor who really by the theory made our _iliad_
1054,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,being employed to that end by pistratus about 540 bc footnote leaf
1057,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,mr leaf and critics who take his general view are enabled to detect
1058,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the patches and tatters of many ages by various tests for example by
1059,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,discovering discrepancies in the narrative such as in their opinion
1060,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,no one sane poet could make other proofs of multiplex authorship are
1061,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,discovered by the critics private sense of what the poem ought to
1062,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,be by his instinctive knowledge of style by detection of the poets
1063,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,supposed errors in geography by modernisms and false archaisms in words
1064,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and grammar and by the presence of many objects especially weapons and
1065,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,armour which the critic believes to have been unknown to the original
1068,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,thus criticism can pick out the things old fairly old late and quite
1069,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,recent from the mass evolved through many centuries which is called
1072,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,if the existing _iliad_ is a mass of expansions added at all sorts of
1073,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,dates in any number of places during very different stages of culture
1074,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,to a single short old poem of the mycenaean age science needs an
1075,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,hypothesis which will account for the _iliad_ as it stands everybody
1076,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,sees the need of the hypothesis how was the medley of new songs by many
1077,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,generations of irresponsible hands codified into a plot which used to
1078,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,be reckoned fine how were the manners customs and characters _unus
1079,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,color_ preserved in a fairly coherent and uniform aspect how was the
1080,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,whole greek world throughout which all manner of discrepant versions
1081,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and incongruous lays must by the theory have been current induced to
1082,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,accept the version which has been bequeathed to us why and for what
1083,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,audience or what readers did somebody in a late age of brief lyrics
1084,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and of philosophic poems take the trouble to harmonise the body of
1087,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,an hypothesis which will answer all these questions is the first thing
1090,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,believers like mr leaf in the development of the _iliad_ through
1091,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the changing revolutionary centuries between say 1200 and 600 bc
1092,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,consciously stand in need of a working hypothesis which will account
1093,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,above all for two facts first the relatively correct preservation of
1094,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the harmony of the picture of life of ideas political and religious
1095,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of the characters of the heroes of the customary law such as the
1096,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,brideprice in marriage and of the details as to weapons implements
1097,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,dress art houses and so forth when these are not according to the
1100,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,next the hypothesis must explain in mr leafs own words how a single
1101,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,version of the _iliad_ came to be accepted where many rival versions
1102,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,must from the necessity of the case have once existed side by side
1105,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,three hypotheses have in fact been imagined the first suggests the
1106,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,preservation of the original poems in very early written texts not
1107,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of course in homers autograph this view mr leaf we shall see
1108,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,discards the second presents the notion of one old sacred college for
1109,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the maintenance of poetic uniformity mr leaf rejects this theory
1112,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,last there is the old hypothesis of wolf pisistratus about 540
1113,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,bc was the first who had the homeric poems committed to writing and
1114,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,brought into that order in which we now possess them
1116,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,this hypothesis now more than a century old would if it rested on
1117,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,good evidence explain how a single version of the various lays came to
1118,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,be accepted and received as authorised the greek world by the theory
1119,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,had only in various places various sets of incoherent chants _orally_
1120,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,current on the wrath of the public was everywhere a public of listeners
1121,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,who heard the lays sung on rare occasions at feasts and fairs or
1122,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,whenever a strolling rhapsodist took up his pitch for a day or two
1123,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,at a street corner there was by the theory no reading public for the
1124,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,homeric poetry but by the time of pisistratus a reading public was
1125,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,coming into existence the tyrant had the poems collected edited
1126,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,arranged into a continuous narrative primarily for the purpose of
1127,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,regulating the recitals at the panathenaic festival when once they
1128,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,were written copies were made and the rest of hellas adopted these for
1131,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,on a small scale we have a case analogous the old songs of scotland
1132,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,existed with the airs partly in human memory partly in scattered
1133,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,broadsheets the airs were good but the words were often silly more
1134,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,often they were fescenninemore dirt than wit burns rewrote the
1135,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,words which were published in handsome volumes with the old airs or
1136,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,with these airs altered and his became the authorised versions while
1139,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the parallel is fairly close but there are points of difference burns
1140,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,was a great lyric poet whereas we hear of no great epic poet in the
1141,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,age of pisistratus the old words which burnss songs superseded were
1142,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,wretched doggerel not such were the ancient greek heroic lays the old
1143,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,scottish songs had no sacred historic character they did not contain
1144,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the history of the various towns and districts of scotland the heroic
1145,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,lays of greece were believed on the other hand to be a kind of
1147,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,heroes thus it was much easier for a great poet like burns to supersede
1148,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,with his songs a mass of unconsidered sculdudery old lays in which no
1149,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,man or set of men had any interest than for a mere editor in the age
1150,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of pisistratus to supersede a set of lays cherished in one shape or
1151,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,another by every state in greece this holds good even if prior to
1152,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,pisistratus there existed in greece no written texts of homer and no
1153,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,reading public a point which we shall show reasons for declining to
1156,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the theory of the edition of pisistratus if it rested on valid
1157,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,evidence would explain how a single version of the poems came to be
1158,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,accepted namely because the poem was now _written_ for the first
1159,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,time and oral versions fell out of memory but it would not of course
1160,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,explain how before pisistratus during four or five centuries of
1161,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,change the new poets and reciters throughout the greek world each
1162,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,adding such fresh verses as he pleased and often introducing such
1163,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,modern details of life as he pleased kept up the harmony of the homeric
1164,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,picture of life and character and law as far as it confessedly
1167,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,to take a single instance the poems never allude to the personal
1168,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,armorial bearings of the heroes they are unknown to or unnamed by
1169,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,homer but are very familiar on the shields in seventh century and sixth
1170,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,century vases and aeschylus introduces them with great poetic effect
1171,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in blank space how did late continuators familiar with the serpents
1172,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,lions bulls heads crabs doves and so forth on the contemporary
1173,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,shields keep such picturesque and attractive details out of their new
1174,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,rhapsodies in mediaeval france we shall show the epics eleventh to
1175,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,thirteenth centuries deal with charlemagne and his peers of the eighth
1176,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,century ad but they provide these heroes with the armorial bearings
1177,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,which came in during the eleventh to twelfth century ad the late
1180,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,wolfs theory then explains how a single version came to be
1181,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,accepted it was the first _written_ version the others died out like
1182,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the old scots orally repeated songs when burns published new words to
1183,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the airs but wolfs theory does not explain the harmony of the picture
1184,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of life the absence of posthomeric ideas and ways of living in the
1187,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in 1892 _companion to the iliad_ mr leaf adopted a different theory
1188,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the hypothesis of a homeric school which busied itself with the
1189,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,tradition of the homeric poetry for there must have been some central
1190,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,authority to preserve the text intact when it could not be preserved in
1191,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,writing were there no such body to maintain a fixed standard the poems
1192,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,must have ended by varying indefinitely according to the caprice of
1195,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,such a school could keep an eye on anachronisms and excise them in
1196,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,fact the maori priests in an infinitely more barbarous state of
1197,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,society had such schools for the preservation of their ancient hymns in
1198,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,purity the older priests insisted on a critical and verbatim
1199,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,rehearsal of all the ancient lore proceedings were sanctioned by human
1200,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,sacrifices and many mystic rites we are not told that new poems were
1201,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,produced and criticised it does not appear that this was the case
1202,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,pupils attended from three to five years and then qualified as priests
1203,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,or _tohunga_ footnote white _the ancient history of the maori vol_
1204,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,i pp 813 suppose that the asiatic greeks like the maoris and
1205,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,zuñis had poetic colleges of a sacred kind admitting new poets and
1206,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,keeping them up to the antique standard in all respects if this were
1207,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,so the relative rarity of anachronisms and of modernisms in language
1208,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in the homeric poems is explained but mr leaf has now entirely
1209,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and with a light heart abandoned his theory of a school which is
1212,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the great problem he writes for those who maintain the gradual
1213,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,growth of the poems by a process of crystallisation has been to
1214,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,understand how a single version came to be accepted where many rival
1215,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,versions must from the necessity of the case have once existed side by
1216,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,side the assumption of a school or guild of singers has been made and
1217,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,mr leaf in 1892 made the assumption himself as some such hypothesis
1218,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,we are bound to make in order to explain the possibility of any theory
1221,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,but now 1900 he says after mentioning the assumption of a school or
1222,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,guild of singers that the rare mention of greek homeridai in
1223,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,chios gives no support to this hypothesis which lacks any other
1224,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,confirmation footnote _iliad_ vol i xviii p xix he therefore
1225,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,now adopts the wolfian hypothesis that an official copy of homer was
1226,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,made in athens at the time of solon or pisistratus from the rhapsodies
1227,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,existing in the memory of reciters footnote _iliad_ vol i p xix
1228,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,but mr leaf had previously said footnote _companion to the iliad_
1229,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,p 190 that the legend which connects his pisistratuss name
1230,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,with the homeric poems is itself probably only conjectural and of
1231,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,late date now the evidence for pisistratus which in 1892 he thought
1232,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,conjectural and of late date seems to him a sufficient basis for an
1233,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,hypothesis of a pisistratean editor of the iliad while the evidence for
1234,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,an homeric school which appeared to him good enough for an hypothesis in
1235,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,1892 is rejected as worthless though in each case the evidence itself
1238,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,this is not very satisfactory and the pisistratean hypothesis is much
1239,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,less useful to a theorist than the former hypothesis of an homeric
1240,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,school for the pisistratean hypothesis cannot explain the harmony of
1241,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the characters and the details in the _iliad_ nor the absence of
1242,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,such glaring anachronisms as the cyclic poets made nor the general
1244,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,pisistratean hypothesis there was not what mr leaf in 1892 justly
1245,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,deemed essential a school to maintain a fixed standard throughout
1246,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the changes of four centuries and against the caprice of many
1247,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,generations of fresh reciters and irresponsible poets the hypothesis of
1248,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,a school _was_ really that which of the two best explained the facts
1249,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and there is no more valid evidence for the first making and writing
1250,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,out of our _iliad_ under pisistratus than for the existence of a homeric
1253,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the evidence for the _iliad_ edited for pisistratus is examined in a
1254,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,note at the close of this chapter meanwhile mr leaf now revives wolfs
1255,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,old theory to account for the fact that somehow a single version
1256,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of the homeric poems came to be accepted his present theory if
1257,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,admitted does account for the acceptation of a single version of the
1258,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,poems the first standard _written_ version but fails to explain how
1259,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the caprice of the different reciters as he says did not wander into
1260,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,every variety of anachronism in detail and in diction thus producing
1261,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,a chaos which no editor of about 540 ad could force into its present
1264,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,such an editor is now postulated by mr leaf if his editors edition
1265,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,as being _written_ was accepted by greece then we understand how a
1266,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,single version came to be accepted but we do not understand how
1267,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the editor could possibly introduce a harmony which could only have
1268,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,characterised his materials as mr leaf has justly remarked if there
1269,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,was an homeric school to maintain a fixed standard but now such
1270,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,harmony in the picture of life as exists in the poems is left without
1271,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,any explanation we have now by the theory a crowd of rhapsodists
1277,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,with no written texts and with no fixed body to maintain a standard
1278,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,such men would certainly not adhere strictly to a stereotyped early
1281,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,again no editor of about 540 bc could possibly bring harmony of
1282,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,manners customs and diction into such of their recitals as he took
1285,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,let us think out the supposed editors situation during three centuries
1286,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,nine generations of strollers have worked their will on one ancient
1287,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,short poem _the wrath_ of _achilles_ this is in itself an unexampled
1288,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,fact poets turn to new topics they do not as a rule for centuries
1289,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,embroider one single situation out of the myriads which heroic legend
1290,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,affords strolling reciters are the least careful of men each would
1291,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,recite in the language and grammar of his day and introduce the newly
1292,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,evolved words and idioms the new and fashionable manners costume and
1293,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,weapons of his time when war chariots became obsolete he would bring
1294,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in cavalry when there was no overlord he would not trouble himself
1295,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,to maintain correctly the character and situation of agamemnon he would
1296,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,speak of coined money in cases of buying and selling his european
1297,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,geography would often be wrong he would not ignore the ionian cities
1298,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of asia most weapons would be of iron not bronze in his lays ionian
1299,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,religious ideas could not possibly be excluded nor changes in customary
1300,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,law civil and criminal yet we think none of these things occurs in
1303,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the editor of the theory had to correct all these anachronisms and
1304,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,discrepancies what a task in an uncritical age the editors materials
1305,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,would be the lays known to such strollers as happened to be gathered
1306,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in athens perhaps at the panathenaic festival the _répertoire_ of each
1307,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,stroller would vary indefinitely from those of all the others one man
1308,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,knew this chant as modified or made by himself other men knew others
1311,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the editor must first have written down from recitation all the passages
1312,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,that he could collect then he was obliged to construct a narrative
1313,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,sequence containing a plot which he fashioned by a process of selection
1314,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and rejection and then he had to combine passages alter them add
1315,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,as much as he thought fit remove anachronisms remove discrepancies
1317,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,transitional passages look with an antiquarian eye after the too
1318,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,manifest modernisms in language and manners and so produce the blank
1319,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,space that in the sixth century bc any man undertook such a task
1320,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,and succeeded so well as to impose on aristotle and all the later greek
1321,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,critics appears to be a theory that could only occur to a modern man of
1322,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,letters who is thinking of the literary conditions of his own time
1323,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,the editor was doing and doing infinitely better what lönnrot in the
1324,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,nineteenth century tried in vain to achieve for the finnish _kalewala_
1327,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,centuries later than pisistratus in a critical age apollonius rhodius
1328,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,set about writing an epic of the homeric times we know how entirely he
1329,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,failed on all hands to restore the manner of homer the editor of 540
1330,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,bc was a more scientific man can any one who sets before himself the
1331,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,nature of the editors task believe in him and it to the masterless
1332,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,floating jellyfish of old poems and new mr leaf supposes that but
1333,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,small and unimportant additions were made after the end of the eighth
1335,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,forces of the ionian race turned to other forms of expression to
1336,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,lyrics and to philosophic poems but the able pisistratean editor after
1337,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,all we find introduced quantities of new matter into the poemsin the
1338,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,middle of the sixth century that kind of industry then did not cease
1339,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,towards the end of the eighth century as we have been told on the
1340,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,other hand as we shall learn the editor contributed to the _iliad_
1345,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,one hypothesis the theory of an homeric schoolwhich would answer our
1346,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,question how was the harmony of the picture of life in remote ages
1347,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,preserved in poems composed in several succeeding ages and in totally
1348,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,altered conditions of lifemr leaf as we know rejects we might
1349,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,suggest again that there were written texts handed down from an early
1350,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,period and preserved in new copies from generation to generation mr
1351,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,leaf states his doubt that there were any such texts the poems were
1352,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,all this time handed down orally only by tradition among the singers
1353,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,_sic_ who used to wander over greece reciting them at popular
1354,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,festivals writing was indeed known through the whole period of epic
1355,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,development some four centuries at least but it is in the highest
1356,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,degree unlikely that it was ever employed to form a standard text of the
1357,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,epic or _any_ part of it there can hardly have been any standard text
1358,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,at best there was a continuous tradition of those parts of the poems
1359,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,which were especially popular and the knowledge of which was a valuable
1362,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,now we would not contend for the existence of any blank space text
1363,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,much before 600 bc and i understand mr leaf not to deny now that
1364,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,there may have been texts of the _odyssey_ and _iliad_ before say
1365,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,600540 bc if cities and reciters had any ancient texts then texts
1366,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,existed though not standard texts and by this means the harmony of
1367,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,thought character and detail in the poems might be preserved we do
1368,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,not think that it is in the highest degree unlikely that there were no
1369,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,texts is this one of the many points on which every savant must rely on
1370,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,his own sense of what is likely to this essential point the almost
1371,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,certain existence of written texts we return in our conclusion
1373,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,what we have to account for is not only the relative lack of
1374,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,anachronisms in poems supposed to have been made through a period of at
1375,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,least four hundred years but also the harmony of the _characters_
1376,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,in subtle details some of the characters will be dealt with later
1377,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,meanwhile it is plain that mr leaf when he rejects both the idea
1378,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,of written texts prior to 600540 bc and also the idea of a school
1379,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,charged with the duty of maintaining a fixed standard leaves a
1380,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,terrible task to his supposed editor of orally transmitted poems which
1381,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,he saysif unpreserved by text or schoolmust have ended by varying
1385,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,on that head there can be no doubt in the supposed circumstances no
1386,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,harmony no _unus_ color could have survived in the poems till the days
1389,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,here then is another difficulty in the path of the theory that the
1390,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,_iliad_ is the work of four centuries if it was we are not enabled to
1391,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,understand how it came to be what it is no editor could possibly tinker
1392,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,it into the whole which we possess none could steer clear of many
1393,HYPOTHESES OF EPIC COMPOSITION,absurd anachronisms these are found by critics but it is our hope to

1400,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",it has been shown in the text that in 1892 mr leaf thought the story
1401,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",about the making of the _iliad_ under pisistratus a legend without
1402,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",authority while he regarded the traditions concerning an homeric school

1405,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",reversed his position the school was abandoned and the story of

1408,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",_iliad_ in the sixth century the age of pisistratus was the silence
1409,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",of aristarchus on the subject he discussed the authenticity of lines
1410,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",in the _iliad_ which according to the legend were interpolated for a
1411,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",political purpose by solon or pisistratus but as far as his comments
1412,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",have reached us in the scholia he never said a word about the tradition
1413,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",of athenian interpolation now aristarchus must at least have known

1430,"THE LEGEND OF THE MAKING OF THE ""ILIAD"" UNDER PISISTRATOS",never be proved that aristarchus was ignorant of the traditions about

1984,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",called by the overlord this could not possibly pass unchallenged among
1985,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",listeners living in the feudal age when a prince called an assembly

1989,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",in an assembly convoked by the overlord would have been regarded
1990,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",by feudal hearers or by any hearers with feudal traditions as an
1991,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",intolerable poetical license thersites would have been at once pulled
1992,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",down and beaten the host would not have rushed to the ships on _his_
1993,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",motion any feudal audience would know better than to endure such
1997,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",as the poem stands and ought to stand nobody less than the overlord
1998,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",acting within his right greek ae themis esti ii 73 could suggest
2001,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",it is the absolute demoralisation of the host in consequence of the
2002,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",strange test of their lord agamemnon making a feigned proposal to fly
2003,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",and it is their confused bewildered return to the assembly under the
2004,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",persuasions of odysseus urged by athene that alone in the poem give
2005,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",thersites his unique opportunity to harangue when the overlord had
2006,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",called an assembly the first word of course was for to speak as
2007,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",he does in the poem as it stands that thersifes should rise in the
2008,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",arrogance bred by the recent disorderly and demoralised proceedings is
2009,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",one thing that he should open the debate when excitement was eager to
2010,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",hear agamemnon and before demoralisation set in is quite another we
2011,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",never hear again of thersites or of any one of the commonalty daring
2012,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",to open his mouth in an assembly thersites sees his one chance the
2013,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",chance of a life time and takes it because agamemnon by means of the
2014,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",testa proposal to flee homewardswhich succeeded it is said in the
2015,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",case of cortèshas reduced the host already discontented to a mob
2017,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",before agamemnon thus displayed his ineptitude as he often does later
2018,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",thersites had no chance all this appears sufficiently obvious if we
2019,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",put ourselves at the point of view of the original listeners thersites
2020,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",merely continues in full assembly the mutinous babble which he has
2021,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",been pouring out to his neighbours during the confused rush to launch
2022,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",the ships and during the return produced by the influence of odysseus
2023,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",the poet says so himself _iliad_ ii 212 the rest sat down 
2024,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",only thersites still chattered on no original poet could manage the
2027,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",we have now examined mr leafs two supposed earliest versions of the
2028,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",beginning of the _iliad_ his presumed earlier version a with no
2029,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",thetis no promise of zeus and no dream and with thersites opening
2030,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",debate is jejune unpoetical and omits the gentler and most winning
2031,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",aspect of the character of achilles while it could not possibly have
2032,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",been accepted by a feudal audience for the reasons already given his
2033,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",presumed later version b with thetis zeus and the false dream
2034,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",cannot be or certainly has not been brought by mr leaf into congruous
2035,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",connection with book xi and it results in the fighting of the
2036,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",_unarmed_ agamemnon which no poet could have been so careless as to
2037,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",invent agamemnon could not go into battle without helmet shield and
2038,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",spears the other armour we need not dwell upon here and thersites
2039,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",could not have opened a debate when the overlord had called the
2040,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",assembly nor could he have moved the chiefs to prepare for flight
2041,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",unless as in the actual _iliad_ they had already been demoralised
2042,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",by the result of the feigned proposal of flight by agamemnon and its
2043,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",effect upon the host probably every reader who understands heroic
2044,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",society temper and manners will so far agree with us
2046,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",our own opinion is that the difficulties in the poem are caused partly
2048,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",and unstable character of agamemnon partly by some accident now
2049,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",indiscoverable save by conjecture which has happened to the text
2051,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",the story in the actual _iliad_ is that zeus planning disaster for the
2052,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",achaeans in accordance with his promise to thetis sends a false dream
2053,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",to tell agamemnon that he will take troy instantly he is bidden by the
2054,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",dream to summon the host to arms agamemnon _still asleep_ has in his
2055,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",mind things not to be fulfilled him seemeth that he shall take priams
2056,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",town that very day ii 36 37 then he awoke ii 41 and
2059,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",being a man crushed by his responsibility and as commanderinchief
2060,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",extremely timid though personally brave he disobeys the dream dresses
2061,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",in civil costume and summons the host to a _peaceful_ assembly not
2062,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",to war as the dream bade him do probably he thought that the host was
2063,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",disaffected and wanted to argue with them in place of commanding
2065,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",here it is that the difficulty comes in and our perplexity is increased
2066,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",by our ignorance of the regular procedure in homeric times was the host
2067,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",not in arms and fighting every day when there was no truce there seems
2068,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",to have been no armistice after the mutiny of achilles for we are
2069,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",told that in the period between his mutiny and the day of the dream of
2070,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",agamemnon achilles was neither going to the assembly nor into battle
2071,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",but wasted his heart abiding there longing for war and the slogan
2072,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",i 489 492 thus it seems that war went on and that assemblies were
2073,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",being held in the absence of achilles it appears however that the
2074,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",fighting was mere skirmishing and raiding no general onslaught was
2075,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",attempted and from book ii _73_ 83 it seems to have been a matter
2076,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",of doubt with agamemnon and nestor whether the army would venture a
2079,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",it also appears from the passage cited i 489 492 that assemblies
2080,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",were being regularly held we are told that achilles did not attend
2081,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",them yet when we come to the assembly ii 86100 it seems to have
2082,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",been a special and exciting affair to judge by the brilliant picture
2083,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",of the crowds the confusion and the cries nothing of the sort is
2084,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",indicated in the meeting of the assembly in i _545_ 8 why is there
2085,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",so much excitement at the assembly of book ii partly because it was
2086,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",summoned _at_ dawn whereas the usual thing was for the host to meet
2087,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",in arms before fighting on the plain or going on raids assemblies were
2088,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",held when the days work was over the host therefore when summoned
2089,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",to an assembly _at dawn_ expects to hear of something out of the
2092,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",we must ask then why does agamemnon after the dream has told him
2093,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",merely to summon the host to arma thing of daily routinecall a
2094,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",deliberative morning assembly a thing clearly not of routine if
2095,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",agamemnon is really full of confidence inspired by the dream why does
2096,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",he determine not to do what is customary call the men to arms but
2097,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",as jeanne darc said to the dauphin to hold such long and weary
2098,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",councils mr jevons speaks of agamemnons confidence in the delusive
2099,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",dream as at variance with his proceedings and would excise ii 3541
2100,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",the only lines which represent agamemnon as confidently believing in
2101,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",the dream footnote _journal_ of _hellenic_ studies vol vii pp
2102,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",306 307 but the poet never once says that agamemnon awake did
2103,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",believe confidently in the dream agamemnon dwelt with hope _while_
2104,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",asleep when he wakenedhe went and called a peaceful morning assembly
2105,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",though the dream bade him call to arms he did not dare to risk his
2106,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",authority this was exactly in keeping with his character the poet
2107,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",should have said when he woke the dream appeared to him rather poor
2108,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",security for success saying so in poetic language of course and
2109,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",then there would be no difficulty in the summoning of an assembly at
2110,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",dawn but either the poet expected us to understand the difference
2111,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",between the hopes of agamemnon sleeping and the doubts of agamemnon
2112,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",waking to chill realitiesan experience common to all of us who

2119,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",led to suppose agamemnon summons the armyto lead them into battle
2120,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",nothing of the sort he calls them to assembly footnote _iliad_
2121,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",vol ii p 46 but we ought not to have been led to suppose that
2122,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",the waking agamemnon was so elated as the sleeping agamemnon he was
2123,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",disillusioned on waking his conduct proves it he did not know what

2131,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",_iliad_ thus xerxes after the defection of artabanus was despondent
2132,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",like agamemnon after the mutiny of achilles and was about to recede

2164,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",who will call first the privy council of the chiefs and then an
2165,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",assembly herein the homesick host will display its humours as it does

2167,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",had a dream of this kind he would most certainly tell it and adds as
2168,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",has been already stated that he will first test the spirit of the

2175,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",it a shameful thing that the achaeans raised the siege of a town with a
2176,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",population much smaller than their own army but allies from many
2177,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",cities help the trojans and are too strong for him whether posterity
2178,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",understands that or not let us flee with our ships

2182,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",the chiefs it appearsa thing most natural in the circumstances
2183,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",but athene finds odysseus in grief neither laid he any hand upon his

2192,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",the poet has thus shown agamemnon in the colours which he wears
2193,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",consistently all through the _iliad_ he has as usual contrasted with

2199,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",intelligible agamemnon is no personal coward but the burden of the
2200,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",safety of the host overcomes him later and he keeps suggesting flight
2201,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",in the ships as we shall see suppose then we read on from ii 40
2202,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",thus the dream left him thinking of things not to be even that on
2203,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",this day he shall take the town of priam but he awoke from sleep
2204,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",with the divine voice ringing in his ears _then it seemed him that

2210,"LOOSE FEUDALISM: THE OVER-LORD IN ""ILIAD,"" BOOKS I. AND II.",preliminary council and proposed that he should try the temper of

2754,MEMORIAL.,destiny of the dead heroes otherwise than as in the old aeolic epos

2757,MEMORIAL.,which the late ionian poets do not cling to old epic tradition but
2758,MEMORIAL.,bring in details of the life of their own date by helbigs other
2759,MEMORIAL.,alternate theory the late poets cling to the model set in old epic
2762,MEMORIAL.,disintegrationists differ far from thinking that the late ionian poet
2763,MEMORIAL.,who buried hector varied from the aeolic minstrel who buried patroclus

2765,MEMORIAL.,abstract of that of patroclus footnote leaf iliad xxii note to
2766,MEMORIAL.,791 he adds that helbigs attempts to distinguish the older aeolic
2767,MEMORIAL.,from the newer and more sceptical ionic faith seem to me visionary

2769,MEMORIAL.,seem but they are examples of the efforts made to prove that the iliad
2770,MEMORIAL.,bears marks of composition continued through several centuries we must
2771,MEMORIAL.,remember that according to helbig the ionians colonists in a new
2772,MEMORIAL.,country had no use for ghosts a fresh colony does not produce
2773,MEMORIAL.,ghosts there is hardly an english or scottish castle without its spook
2774,MEMORIAL.,_spuck_ on the other hand you look in vain for such a thing in the
2777,MEMORIAL.,this is a hasty generalisation helbig will if he looks find ghosts

2788,MEMORIAL.,achilles xxiii 416 first hails his friend even in the house of
2789,MEMORIAL.,hades so he believes that spirits are in hades and says that he
2790,MEMORIAL.,has brought hector raw for dogs to devour and twelve trojans of good
2791,MEMORIAL.,family to slaughter before thy pyre that night when achilles is
2792,MEMORIAL.,asleep xxiii 65 the spirit greek psyche of patroclus appears to

2797,MEMORIAL.,never more again shall i come back from hades when ye have given me my
2798,MEMORIAL.,due of fire patroclus being newly discarnate does not yet know

2807,MEMORIAL.,hector was buried in a _larnax_ so will achilles and patroclus be

2815,MEMORIAL.,dead albeit the life or the wits be not anywise therein for all
2816,MEMORIAL.,night hath the spirit of hapless patroclus stood over me
2818,MEMORIAL.,in this speech helbig detects the hand of the late ionian poet what
2819,MEMORIAL.,goes before is part of the genuine old epic the kernel done at a time
2820,MEMORIAL.,when men believed that spooks could take part in the affairs of the
2821,MEMORIAL.,upper world achilles therefore in his dream thought that he
2822,MEMORIAL.,could embrace his friend it was the sceptical ionian in a fresh and
2823,MEMORIAL.,spookless colony who knew that he could not he thinks the ghost a mere
2824,MEMORIAL.,dream and introduces his scepticism in xxiii 99107 he brought
2825,MEMORIAL.,in the ruling ideas of his own period the ghost says the ionian
2826,MEMORIAL.,_bearbeiter_ is intangible though in the genuine old epic the ghost
2827,MEMORIAL.,himself thought otherwisehe being new to the situation and without
2828,MEMORIAL.,experience this is the first sample of the critical ionian spirit
2829,MEMORIAL.,later so remarkable in philosophy and natural science says helbig
2832,MEMORIAL.,we need not discuss this acute critical theory the natural
2833,MEMORIAL.,interpretation of the words of achilles is obvious as mr leaf remarks
2834,MEMORIAL.,the words are the cry of sudden personal conviction in a matter which
2835,MEMORIAL.,has hitherto been lazily accepted as an orthodox dogma footnote
2836,MEMORIAL.,_iliad_ vol ii p 620 already as we have seen achilles has made
2837,MEMORIAL.,promises to patroclus in the house of hades now he exclaims there
2838,MEMORIAL.,really is something in the doctrine of a feeble future life
2840,MEMORIAL.,it is vain to try to discriminate between an old epic belief in
2841,MEMORIAL.,ablebodied ghosts and an ionian belief in mere futile _shades_ in
2842,MEMORIAL.,the homeric poems everywhere the dead are too feeble to be worth
2843,MEMORIAL.,worshipping after they are burned but as mr leaf says with obvious
2844,MEMORIAL.,truth and with modern instances men are never so inconsistent as in
2845,MEMORIAL.,their beliefs about the other world we ourselves hold various beliefs
2846,MEMORIAL.,simultaneously the natives of australia and of tasmania practise or
2847,MEMORIAL.,did practise every conceivable way of disposing of the deadburying
2848,MEMORIAL.,burning exposure in trees carrying about the bodies or parts of them
2849,MEMORIAL.,eating the bodies and so forth if each such practice corresponded as
2850,MEMORIAL.,archaeologists believe to a different opinion about the soul then
2851,MEMORIAL.,all beliefs were held together at once and this in fact is the case
2852,MEMORIAL.,there is not now one and now another hard and fast orthodoxy of belief
2853,MEMORIAL.,about the dead though now we find ancestor worship prominent and now in
2856,MEMORIAL.,after gifts of hair and the setting up of jars full of oil and honey
2857,MEMORIAL.,achilles has the body laid on the top of the pyre in the centre bodies
2858,MEMORIAL.,of sheep and oxen two dogs and four horses are strewed around why we
2859,MEMORIAL.,know not for the dead is not supposed to need food the rite may be
2860,MEMORIAL.,a survival for there were sacrifices at the burials of the mycenaean

2862,MEMORIAL.,anger at thy slaying he says xxiii 23 this was his reason as far
2863,MEMORIAL.,as he consciously had any reason not that his friend might have twelve
2864,MEMORIAL.,thralls in hades after the pyre is alit achilles drenches it all night
2865,MEMORIAL.,with wine and when the flame dies down the dead heros bones are

2883,MEMORIAL.,helbig looking for ionian innovations in book xxiv finds that the
2884,MEMORIAL.,deathgarb of hector is not the same as that of patroclus in book xxiii
2885,MEMORIAL.,one difference is that when the squires of achilles took the ransom of
2886,MEMORIAL.,hector from the waggon of priam they left in it two greek pharea and
2887,MEMORIAL.,a wellspun chiton the women washed and anointed hectors body they
2888,MEMORIAL.,clad him in the chiton and threw one greek pharos over it we are
2889,MEMORIAL.,not told what they did with the other perhaps as mr leaf says it was
2890,MEMORIAL.,used as a cover for the bier perhaps it was not but was laid under the
2891,MEMORIAL.,body helbig all we know is that hectors body was restored to priam
2892,MEMORIAL.,in a chiton and a greek pharos which do not seem to have been
2893,MEMORIAL.,removed before he was burned while patroclus had no chiton in death
2896,MEMORIAL.,to the ordinary reader this does not seem in the circumstances a
2897,MEMORIAL.,strong mark of different ages and different burial customs priam did
2898,MEMORIAL.,not bring any linen sheetor whatever greek heanos lis may bein

2902,MEMORIAL.,son part of what he had brought nothing can be more natural and
2903,MEMORIAL.,there we may say is an end ont they did what they could in the
2904,MEMORIAL.,circumstances but helbig has observed that in a cean inscription of
2905,MEMORIAL.,the fifth century bc there is a sumptuary law forbidding a corpse to
2906,MEMORIAL.,wear more than three white garments a sheet under him a chiton and a
2907,MEMORIAL.,mantle cast over him footnote op _laud_ p 209 he supposes that
2908,MEMORIAL.,hector wore the chiton and had one greek pharos over him and the
2909,MEMORIAL.,other under him though homer does not say that the laws of solon also
2910,MEMORIAL.,confined the dead man to three articles of dress footnote plutarch
2911,MEMORIAL.,solon 21 in doing so solon sanctioned an old custom and that ionian
2912,MEMORIAL.,custom described by the author of book xxiv bewrays him says helbig
2913,MEMORIAL.,for a late ionian _bearbeiter_ deserting true epic usages and inserting
2914,MEMORIAL.,those of his own day but in some attic dipylon vases in the pictures
2915,MEMORIAL.,of funerals we see no garments or sheets over the corpses
2917,MEMORIAL.,penelope also wove a greek charos against the burial of old laertes
2918,MEMORIAL.,but surely she ought to have woven for him on helbigs showing hector
2919,MEMORIAL.,had _two_ patroclus had only one patroclus is in the old epic hector
2920,MEMORIAL.,and laertes are in the ionian epics therefore laertes should have had
2921,MEMORIAL.,two greek charea but we only hear of one penelope had to finish the
2922,MEMORIAL.,greek charos and show it footnote odyssey xxiv 147 now if she
2923,MEMORIAL.,wanted to delay her marriage she should have begun the second greek
2924,MEMORIAL.,charos just as necessary as the first if hector with a pair of
2925,MEMORIAL.,greek charea represents ionian usage but penelope never thought of
2926,MEMORIAL.,what had she read helbig she would have seen to be so obvious she
2927,MEMORIAL.,thought of no funeral garments for the old man but one shroud greek
2928,MEMORIAL.,speiron odyssey ii 102 xix 147 yet being by the theory a
2929,MEMORIAL.,character of late ionian not of genuine old aeolic epic she should
2930,MEMORIAL.,have known better it is manifest that if even the acuteness and vast
2931,MEMORIAL.,erudition of helbig can only find such invisible differences as
2932,MEMORIAL.,these between the manners of the genuine old epic and the late ionian
2933,MEMORIAL.,innovations there is really no difference beyond such trifles as
2936,MEMORIAL.,hector when burned and when his ashes have been placed in the casket
2937,MEMORIAL.,is laid in a greek kapetos a ditch or trench _iliad_ xv 356
2938,MEMORIAL.,xviii 564 but here xxiv 797 greek kapetos is a chamber covered
2939,MEMORIAL.,with great stones within the howe the casket being swathed with purple
2940,MEMORIAL.,robes and this was the end the ghost of hector would not revisit the
2941,MEMORIAL.,sun as ghosts do freely in the cyclic poems a proof that the cyclics
2942,MEMORIAL.,are later than the homeric poems footnote helbig op _laud_ pp
2945,MEMORIAL.,if the burning of the weapons of eetion and elpenor are traces of
2946,MEMORIAL.,another than the _old_ aeolic epic faith footnote ibid p 253
2947,MEMORIAL.,they are also traces of another than the late _ionic_ epic faith for no
2948,MEMORIAL.,weapons are burned with hector in the _odyssey_ the weapons of achilles
2949,MEMORIAL.,are not burned in the _iliad_ the armour of patroclus is not burned
2950,MEMORIAL.,no victims of any kind are burned with hector possibly the poet was not
2951,MEMORIAL.,anxious to repeat what he had just described his last book is already
2952,MEMORIAL.,a very long book possibly the trojans did not slay victims at the
2955,MEMORIAL.,the howes or barrows built over the homeric dead were hillocks high
2956,MEMORIAL.,enough to be good points of outlook for scouts as in the case of the
2957,MEMORIAL.,barrow of aesyetes _iliad_ ii 793 and the steep mound the howe of
2958,MEMORIAL.,lithe myrine ii 814 we do not know that women were usually buried
2959,MEMORIAL.,in howe but myrine was a warrior maiden of the amazons we know then
2960,MEMORIAL.,minutely what the homeric mode of burial was with such variations as
2961,MEMORIAL.,have been noted we have burning and howe even in the case of an obscure
2962,MEMORIAL.,oarsman like elpenor it is not probable however that every peaceful
2963,MEMORIAL.,mechanic had a howe all to himself he may have had a small family
2966,MEMORIAL.,the interesting fact is that no barrow burial precisely of the homeric
2967,MEMORIAL.,kind has ever been discovered in greek sites the old mycenaeans buried
2968,MEMORIAL.,either in shaft graves or in a stately _tholos_ and in rock chambers
2969,MEMORIAL.,later in the town cemetery they did not burn the bodies the people of
2970,MEMORIAL.,the dipylon period sometimes cremated sometimes inhumed but they built
2971,MEMORIAL.,no barrow over the dead footnote _annal de linst_ 1872 pp 135

2975,MEMORIAL.,oldest parts of the poems tell us nothing footnote _iliad_ vol ii
2976,MEMORIAL.,p 619 note 2 while mr leaf says that the oldest parts of the poems
2977,MEMORIAL.,tell us nothing of burial he accepts xxii 342 343 as of the oldest
2978,MEMORIAL.,part these lines describe cremation and mr leaf does not think them
2979,MEMORIAL.,borrowed from the later vii 79 80 but that vii 79 80 are perhaps
2980,MEMORIAL.,borrowed from xxii 342 343 it follows that the oldest parts of the
2981,MEMORIAL.,poems do tell us of cremation we shall show however that mr leafs
2982,MEMORIAL.,kernel alludes to cremation what is late in this case it is not
2983,MEMORIAL.,the dipylon period say 900750 bc it is not any later period one or
2984,MEMORIAL.,two late barrow burials do not answer to the homeric descriptions the
2985,MEMORIAL.,late parts of the poems therefore dealing with burials in books
2986,MEMORIAL.,vi vii xix xxiii xxiv and the odyssey are of an age not
2987,MEMORIAL.,in the mycenaean prime not in the dipylon period not in any later
2988,MEMORIAL.,period say the seventh or sixth centuries bc and necessarily not
2989,MEMORIAL.,of any subsequent period yet nobody dreams of saying that the poets
2990,MEMORIAL.,describe a purely fanciful form of interment they speak of what they
2991,MEMORIAL.,know in daily life if it be argued that the late poets preserve by
2992,MEMORIAL.,sheer force of epic tradition a form of burial unknown in their own
2993,MEMORIAL.,age we ask why did epic tradition not preserve the burial methods
2994,MEMORIAL.,of the mycenaean prime the shaft grave or the _tholos_ without
2997,MEMORIAL.,mr leafs own conclusion is that the people of mycenae were spirit
2999,MEMORIAL.,second fact is dubious in the postmycenaean dipylon period we

3002,MEMORIAL.,conceivable beliefs we have said about the dead are apt to coexist
3004,MEMORIAL.,australian modes of dealing with the dead see howitt _native tribes of
3006,MEMORIAL.,australia_ it seems that the homeric poems mark this intermediate
3007,MEMORIAL.,point footnote leaf _iliad_ vol ii p 622 in that case
3008,MEMORIAL.,the homeric poems are of one age or at least all of them save the
3009,MEMORIAL.,original kernel are of one age namely a period subsequent to the
3010,MEMORIAL.,mycenaean prime but considerably prior to the dipylon period which
3014,MEMORIAL.,we welcome this conclusion and note that whatever may be the case
3015,MEMORIAL.,with the oldest parts of the poems which say nothing about funerals the
3016,MEMORIAL.,latest expansions must be of about 11001000 bc  the poem is so
3017,MEMORIAL.,early that it is prior to hero worship and ancestor worship or it
3018,MEMORIAL.,might be more judicious to say that the poem is of an age that did not
3020,MEMORIAL.,folkcustom the homeric age is one which had outgrown ancestor and hero
3021,MEMORIAL.,worship and had not like the age of the cyclics relapsed into it
3022,MEMORIAL.,_enfin_ unless we agree with helbig as to essential variations of
3023,MEMORIAL.,custom the poems are the work of one age and that a brief age and an
3024,MEMORIAL.,age of peculiar customs cremation and barrow burial and of a religion
3025,MEMORIAL.,that stood without spirit worship between the mycenzean period and the
3026,MEMORIAL.,ninth century that seems as certain as anything in prehistoric times
3027,MEMORIAL.,can be unless we are to say that after the age of shaft graves and
3028,MEMORIAL.,spirit worship came an age of cremation and of no spirit worship and
3030,MEMORIAL.,of _this_ period into their own ages of hero worship and inhumation
3031,MEMORIAL.,though they did not preserve the tradition of the shaftgrave period
3032,MEMORIAL.,we cannot accept this theory of adherence to stereotyped poetical
3033,MEMORIAL.,descriptions nor can any one consistently adopt it in this case
3035,MEMORIAL.,the reason is obvious mr leaf with many other critics distinguishes
3036,MEMORIAL.,several successive periods of expansion in the first stratum we have
3037,MEMORIAL.,the remains of the original kernel among these remains is the slaying
3038,MEMORIAL.,of hector xxii 1404 with but slight additions footnote leaf
3039,MEMORIAL.,_iliad_ vol ii p xi in the slaying of hector that hero indicates
3040,MEMORIAL.,cremation as the mode of burial give them my body back again that
3041,MEMORIAL.,the trojans and trojans wives grant me my due of fire after my death
3042,MEMORIAL.,perhaps this allusion to cremation in the original kernel in the
3043,MEMORIAL.,slaying of hector may be dismissed as a late borrowing from book vii
3044,MEMORIAL.,79 80 where hector makes conditions that the fallen hero shall be
3045,MEMORIAL.,restored to his friends when he challenges the achaeans to a duel but
3046,MEMORIAL.,whoever knows the curious economy by way of repetition that marks early
3047,MEMORIAL.,national epics has a right to regard the allusion to cremation xxii
3048,MEMORIAL.,342343 as an example of this practice compare _la chancun de
3049,MEMORIAL.,williame_ lines 10411058 with lines 11401134 in both the dinner of
3050,MEMORIAL.,a knight who has been long deprived of food is described in passages
3051,MEMORIAL.,containing many identical lines the poet having found his formula
3052,MEMORIAL.,uses it whenever occasion serves there are several other examples in
3053,MEMORIAL.,the same epic footnote _romania_ xxxiv pp 245 246 repetitions
3054,MEMORIAL.,in homer need not indicate late additions the artifice is part of the
3055,MEMORIAL.,epic as it is of the ballad manner if we are right cremation is the
3056,MEMORIAL.,mode of burial even in the original kernel hector moreover in the
3057,MEMORIAL.,kernel xxii 256259 makes before his final fight with achilles
3058,MEMORIAL.,the same proposal as he makes in his challenge to a duel vii 85 et
3059,MEMORIAL.,_seqq_ the victor shall give back the body of the vanquished to his
3060,MEMORIAL.,friends but how the friends are to bury it hector does not sayin this
3063,MEMORIAL.,in the kernel and all periods of expansion funeral rites are described
3064,MEMORIAL.,and in all the method is cremation with a howe or a barrow thus the
3065,MEMORIAL.,method of cremation had come in as early as the kernel the slaying
3066,MEMORIAL.,of hector and as early as the first expansions and it lasted till the
3067,MEMORIAL.,period of the latest expansions such as books xxiii xxiv
3069,MEMORIAL.,but what is the approximate date of the various expansions of the
3070,MEMORIAL.,original poem on that point mr leaf gives his opinion the making of
3071,MEMORIAL.,the arms of achilles books xviii xix 139 is with the funeral of
3072,MEMORIAL.,patroclus xxiii 1256 in the second set of expansions and is thus
3073,MEMORIAL.,two removes later than the original kernel footnote leaf _iliad_
3074,MEMORIAL.,vol ii p xii now this is the periodthe making of the shield for
3075,MEMORIAL.,achilles is at least in touch with the periodof the eminently free
3076,MEMORIAL.,and naturalistic treatment which we find in the best mycenaean work
3077,MEMORIAL.,in the dagger blades in the siege fragment and notably in the vaphio
3078,MEMORIAL.,cups which show longhaired men not men closecropped as in the
3079,MEMORIAL.,daggers and siege fragment footnote leaf _iliad_ vol ii p 606
3080,MEMORIAL.,the poet of the age of the second expansions then is at least
3081,MEMORIAL.,in touch with the work of the shaft grave and ages he need not be
3082,MEMORIAL.,contemporary with that epoch but may well have had in his mind the
3083,MEMORIAL.,work of artists older than himself it is vaguely possible that he may
3084,MEMORIAL.,have seen an ancient shield of the mycenaean prime and may be inspired
3087,MEMORIAL.,moreover and still more remarkable the ordinary homeric form of
3088,MEMORIAL.,cremation and howeburial is even older than the period which if not
3089,MEMORIAL.,contemporary with is clearly reminiscent of the art of the shaft
3090,MEMORIAL.,graves for in the period of the first expansions vii 13 i 2
3091,MEMORIAL.,the form of burial is cremation with a barrow or tumulus footnote
3092,MEMORIAL.,_ibid_ vol ii p xi and pp 606 607 thus mr leafs opinion
3093,MEMORIAL.,might lead us to the conclusion that the usual homeric form of burial
3094,MEMORIAL.,occurs in a period _prior_ to an age in which the poet is apparently
3095,MEMORIAL.,reminiscent of the work of two early epochsthe epoch of shaft graves
3096,MEMORIAL.,and that of _tholos_ graves if this be so cremation and urn burial in
3097,MEMORIAL.,cairns may be nearly as old as the mycenaean shaft graves or as old
3098,MEMORIAL.,as the _tholos_ graves and they endure into the age of the latest
3101,MEMORIAL.,we must not press however opinions founded on the apparent technical
3102,MEMORIAL.,resemblance of the free style and coloured metal work on the shield of
3103,MEMORIAL.,achilles to the coloured metal work and free design on the daggers
3104,MEMORIAL.,of the mycenaean shaft graves it is enough for us to note that the
3105,MEMORIAL.,passages concerning burial from the kernel itself and also from the
3106,MEMORIAL.,earliest to the latest expansions are all perfectly harmonious and of
3107,MEMORIAL.,a single ageunless we are convinced by helbigs objections that age
3108,MEMORIAL.,must have been brief indeed for before it arrives the period of
3109,MEMORIAL.,_tholos_ graves as at vaphio must expire on one hand while the
3110,MEMORIAL.,blending of cremation with inhumation in the dipylon age must have
3111,MEMORIAL.,been evolved after the cremation age passed on the other that brief
3112,MEMORIAL.,intervening age however was the age of the _iliad_ and odyssey this
3113,MEMORIAL.,conclusion can only be avoided by alleging that late poets however
3114,MEMORIAL.,recent and revolutionary carefully copied the oldest epic model of
3115,MEMORIAL.,burial while they innovated in almost every other point so we are
3116,MEMORIAL.,told we can go no further till we find an unrifled cairn burial
3117,MEMORIAL.,answering to homeric descriptions we have indeed in thessaly a
3118,MEMORIAL.,large tumulus which contained a silver urn with burned remains but
3119,MEMORIAL.,the accompanying pottery dated it in the second century bc footnote
3120,MEMORIAL.,ridgeway _early age of greece_ vol i p 491 _journal of hellenic
3121,MEMORIAL.,studies vol xx_ pp 2025 it is possible enough that all tumuli of
3122,MEMORIAL.,the homeric period have been robbed by grave plunderers in the course
3123,MEMORIAL.,of the ages as the vikings are said to have robbed the cairns of
3124,MEMORIAL.,sutherlandshire in which they were not likely to find a rich reward
3125,MEMORIAL.,for their labours a conspicuous howe invites robberythe heroes of the
3126,MEMORIAL.,saga like grettir occasionally rob a howeand the fact is unlucky for
3129,MEMORIAL.,we have now tried to show that as regards 1 to the absence from
3130,MEMORIAL.,homer of new religious and ritual ideas or of very old ideas revived
3131,MEMORIAL.,in ionia 2 as concerns the clear conception of a loose form of
3132,MEMORIAL.,feudalism with an overlord and 3 in the matter of burial the
3133,MEMORIAL.,_iliad_ and odyssey are selfconsistent and bear the impress of a
3136,MEMORIAL.,the fact if accepted is incompatible with the theory that the poets
3137,MEMORIAL.,both introduced the peculiar conditions of their own later ages and
3139,MEMORIAL.,only is such archaising inconsistent with the art of an uncritical age
3140,MEMORIAL.,but a careful archaiser with all the resources of alexandrian criticism
3141,MEMORIAL.,at his command could not archaise successfully we refer to quintus
3142,MEMORIAL.,smyrnaeus author of the _post homerica_ in fourteen books quintus
3143,MEMORIAL.,does his best but we never observe in him that _naïf_ delight in
3144,MEMORIAL.,describing weapons and works of art and details of law and custom which
3145,MEMORIAL.,are so conspicuous in homer and in other early poets he does give us
3146,MEMORIAL.,penthesileas great sword with a hilt of ivory and silver but of what
3147,MEMORIAL.,metal was the blade we are not told and the reader of quintus will
3148,MEMORIAL.,observe that though he knows greek chalkos bronze as a synonym
3149,MEMORIAL.,for weapons he scarcely ever if ever says that a sword or spear or
3150,MEMORIAL.,arrowhead was of bronzea point on which homer constantly insists
3151,MEMORIAL.,when he names the military metal quintus usually speaks of iron he has
3152,MEMORIAL.,no interest in the constitutional and legal sides of heroic life so
3155,MEMORIAL.,yet quintus consciously archaises in a critical age with homer as
3156,MEMORIAL.,his model any one who believes that in an uncritical age rhapsodists
3157,MEMORIAL.,archaised with such success as the presumed late poets of the _iliad_
3158,MEMORIAL.,must have done may try his hand in our critical age at a ballad in the
3159,MEMORIAL.,style of the border ballads if he succeeds in producing nothing that
3160,MEMORIAL.,will at once mark his work as modern he will be more successful than
3161,MEMORIAL.,any poet who has made the experiment and more successful than the most
3162,MEMORIAL.,ingenious modern forgers of gems jewels and terracottas they seldom
3163,MEMORIAL.,deceive experts and when they do other experts detect the deceit
3173,HOMERIC ARMOUR,tested by their ideas their picture of political society and their
3174,HOMERIC ARMOUR,descriptions of burial rites the presumed authors of the alleged
3175,HOMERIC ARMOUR,expansions of the _iliad_ all lived in one and the same period of
3176,HOMERIC ARMOUR,culture but according to the prevalent critical theory we read in
3177,HOMERIC ARMOUR,the _iliad_ not only large expansions of many dates but also briefer
3179,HOMERIC ARMOUR,the final literary redaction had come says mr leafthat is about 540
3180,HOMERIC ARMOUR,bcwe cannot feel sure that any details even of the oldest work
3181,HOMERIC ARMOUR,were secure from the touch of the latest poet footnote leaf
3184,HOMERIC ARMOUR,here we are far from mr leafs own opinion that the whole scenery of
3185,HOMERIC ARMOUR,the poems the details of armour palaces dress decoration  had
3186,HOMERIC ARMOUR,become stereotyped and formed a foundation which the epic poet dared
3187,HOMERIC ARMOUR,not intentionally sap footnote _ibid_ vol i p xv we now
3188,HOMERIC ARMOUR,find footnote _ibid_ vol ii p ix that the latest poet saps
3189,HOMERIC ARMOUR,as much as he pleases down to the middle of the sixth century bc
3190,HOMERIC ARMOUR,moreover in the middle of the sixth century bc the supposed
3192,HOMERIC ARMOUR,passages and added many speeches by nestor an ancestor of
3195,HOMERIC ARMOUR,did these very late interlopers down to the sixth century introduce
3196,HOMERIC ARMOUR,modern details into the picture of life did they blur the _unus_ color
3197,HOMERIC ARMOUR,we hope to prove that if they did so at all it was but slightly that
3198,HOMERIC ARMOUR,the poems however with a mycenaean or submycenaean basis of actual
3199,HOMERIC ARMOUR,custom and usage contain numerous contaminations from the usage of
3200,HOMERIC ARMOUR,centuries as late as the seventh is the view of mr leaf and reichel
3204,HOMERIC ARMOUR,reichels hypothesis is that the heroes of the original poet had no
3205,HOMERIC ARMOUR,defensive armour except the great mycenaean shields that the ponderous
3206,HOMERIC ARMOUR,shield made the use of chariots imperatively necessary that after the
3207,HOMERIC ARMOUR,mycenaean age a small buckler and a corslet superseded the unwieldy
3208,HOMERIC ARMOUR,shield that chariots were no longer used that by the seventh century
3209,HOMERIC ARMOUR,bc a warrior could not be thought of without a breastplate and that
3210,HOMERIC ARMOUR,new poets thrust corslets and greaves into songs both new and old
3212,HOMERIC ARMOUR,how the new poets could conceive of warriors as always in chariots
3213,HOMERIC ARMOUR,whereas in practice they knew no war chariots and yet could not
3214,HOMERIC ARMOUR,conceive of them without corslets which the original poet never saw is
3215,HOMERIC ARMOUR,reichels secret the new poets had in the old lays a plain example to
3216,HOMERIC ARMOUR,follow they did follow it as to chariots and shields as to corslets
3217,HOMERIC ARMOUR,and greaves they reversed it such is the reichelian theory
3221,THE SHIELD,as regards armour controversy is waged over the shield corslet and
3222,THE SHIELD,bronze greaves in homer the shield is of leather plated with bronze
3223,THE SHIELD,and of bronze is the corslet no shields of bronze plating and no bronze
3226,THE SHIELD,we have to ask do the homeric descriptions of shields tally with the
3227,THE SHIELD,representations of shields in works of art discovered in the graves
3228,THE SHIELD,of mycenae spata in attica vaphio in sparta and elsewhere if the
3229,THE SHIELD,descriptions in homer vary from these relics to what extent do they
3230,THE SHIELD,vary and do the differences arise from the fact that the poet describes
3231,THE SHIELD,consistently what he sees in his own age or are the variations caused
3232,THE SHIELD,by late rhapsodists in the iron age who keep the great obsolete shields
3233,THE SHIELD,and bronze weapons yet introduce the other military gear of their day
3236,THE SHIELD,it may be best to inquire first what does the poet or what do
3237,THE SHIELD,the poets say about shields and next to examine the evidence of
3238,THE SHIELD,representations of shields in mycenaean art always remembering that the
3239,THE SHIELD,poet does not pretend to live and beyond all doubt does not live in
3240,THE SHIELD,the mycenaean prime and that the testimony of the tombs is liable to be
3243,THE SHIELD,in _iliad_ ii 388 the shield _aspis_ is spoken of as covering a
3244,THE SHIELD,man about greek _amphibrotae_ while in the heat of battle the
3245,THE SHIELD,baldric _telamon_ or belt of the shield shall be wet with sweat
3246,THE SHIELD,the shield then is not an ionian buckler worn on the left arm but is
3247,THE SHIELD,suspended by a belt and covers a man or most of him just as mycenaean

3259,THE SHIELD,the shield of menelaus iii 348 is equal in all directions which we
3260,THE SHIELD,might conceive to mean mathematically circular as the words do mean
3261,THE SHIELD,that a shield is said to have circles and a spear which grazes

3263,THE SHIELD,equalrends both circles the outer circle of bronze and the inner

3265,THE SHIELD,unjustly believed to be late and we cannot rely on it as proof
3266,THE SHIELD,that homer knew circular shields among others the epithet _greek
3267,THE SHIELD,eukuklykos_ of good circle is commonly given to the shields but
3268,THE SHIELD,does not mean that the shield was circular we are told but merely that
3269,THE SHIELD,it was made of circular plates footnote leaf _iliad_ vol i p
3270,THE SHIELD,573 as for the shield of menelaus and other shields described in the
3271,THE SHIELD,same words every way equal the epithet is not now allowed to mean
3272,THE SHIELD,circular mr leaf annotating _iliad_ i 306 says that this sense

3276,THE SHIELD,_homerische epos_ p 315 cf on the other hand p 317 note i
3278,THE SHIELD,to the rendering circular it is objected that a circular shield of
3279,THE SHIELD,say four feet and a half in diameter would be intolerably heavy and
3280,THE SHIELD,superfluously wide while the shields represented in mycenaean art are
3281,THE SHIELD,not circles but rather resemble a figure of eight in some cases or a
3282,THE SHIELD,section of a cylinder in others or again a door fig 5 p 130
3284,THE SHIELD,what homer really meant by such epithets as equal every way very
3285,THE SHIELD,circular of a good circle cannot be ascertained since homeric
3286,THE SHIELD,epithets of the shield which were previously rendered circular of
3287,THE SHIELD,good circle and so on are now translated in quite other senses in
3288,THE SHIELD,order that homeric descriptions may be made to tally with mycenaean
3289,THE SHIELD,representations of shields which are never circular as represented in
3290,THE SHIELD,works of art in this position of affairs we are unable to determine the
3293,THE SHIELD,a scholars rendering of homers epithets applied to the shield is
3294,THE SHIELD,obliged to vary with the variations of his theory about the shield
3295,THE SHIELD,thus in 1883 mr leaf wrote the poet often calls the shield by names
3296,THE SHIELD,which seem to imply that it was round and yet indicates that it was
3297,THE SHIELD,large enough to cover the whole body of a man in descriptions the
3298,THE SHIELD,round shape is always implied the words which indicated that the
3299,THE SHIELD,shield or one shield really looked like a tower and really reached
3300,THE SHIELD,from neck to ankles in two or three cases were received by the poet
3301,THE SHIELD,from the earlier achaean lays but to homer the warriors appeared as
3302,THE SHIELD,using the later small round shield his belief in the heroic strength of
3303,THE SHIELD,the men of old time made it quite natural to speak of them as bearing
3304,THE SHIELD,a shield which at once combined the later circular shape and the old
3308,THE SHIELD,here the homeric words which naturally mean circular or round are
3309,THE SHIELD,accepted as meaning round or circular homer it is supposed in
3310,THE SHIELD,practice only knows the round shields of the later age 700 bc so he
3311,THE SHIELD,calls shields round but obedient to tradition he conceives of them
3314,THE SHIELD,but after the appearance of reichels speculations the homeric words
3315,THE SHIELD,for round and circular have been explained as meaning something
3316,THE SHIELD,else and mr leaf in place of maintaining that homer knew no shields
3317,THE SHIELD,but round shields now writes 1900 the small circular shield of
3318,THE SHIELD,later timesis equally unknown to homer with a very few curious
3320,THE SHIELD,try to show footnote leaf _iliad_ vol i p 575
3322,THE SHIELD,thus does science fluctuate now homer knows in practice none but light
3323,THE SHIELD,round bucklers dating from about 700 bc again he does not know
3324,THE SHIELD,them at all though they were habitually used in the period at which
3325,THE SHIELD,the later parts of his epic were composed we shall have to ask how
3326,THE SHIELD,did small round bucklers come to be unknown to late poets who saw them
3329,THE SHIELD,some scholars then believe that the old original poet always described
3330,THE SHIELD,mycenaean shields which are of various shapes but never circular in
3331,THE SHIELD,mycenaean art if there are any circular shields in the poems these
3332,THE SHIELD,they say must have been introduced by poets accustomed in a much later
3334,THE SHIELD,understood as meaning circular must now mean something elseeven if
3337,THE SHIELD,other scholars believe that the poet in real life saw various types of
3338,THE SHIELD,shields in use and that some of them were survivals of the mycenaean
3339,THE SHIELD,shields semicylindrical or shaped like figures of 8 or like a
3340,THE SHIELD,door others were circular and these scholars presume that homer meant
3341,THE SHIELD,circular when he said circular neither school will convert the
3342,THE SHIELD,other and we cannot decide between them we do not pretend to be
3343,THE SHIELD,certain as to whether the original poet saw shields of various types
3344,THE SHIELD,including the round shape in use though that is possible or whether
3347,THE SHIELD,as regards size homer certainly describes in several cases shields
3348,THE SHIELD,very much larger than most which we know for certain to have been common
3349,THE SHIELD,after say 700 bc he speaks of shields reaching from neck to ankles
3350,THE SHIELD,and covering the body of a man about whether he was also familiar
3351,THE SHIELD,with smaller shields of various types is uncertain he does not
3352,THE SHIELD,explicitly say that any small bucklers were used by the chiefs nor
3353,THE SHIELD,does he explicitly say that all shields were of the largest type it is
3354,THE SHIELD,possible that at the time when the epic was composed various types of
3355,THE SHIELD,shield were being tried while the vast ancient shield was far from
3358,THE SHIELD,to return to the _size_ of the shield in a feigned tale of odysseus
3359,THE SHIELD,odyssey xiv 474477 men in a wintry ambush place their shields over
3360,THE SHIELD,their shoulders as they lie on the ground to be a protection against
3361,THE SHIELD,snow but any sort of shield large or small would protect the
3362,THE SHIELD,shoulders of men in a recumbent position quite a large shield may seem
3363,THE SHIELD,to be indicated in _iliad_ xiii 400405 where idomeneus curls up his
3364,THE SHIELD,whole person behind his shield he was hidden by it yet as any
3365,THE SHIELD,one can see by experiment a man who crouched low would be protected
3366,THE SHIELD,entirely by a highland targe of less than thirty inches in diameter so
3367,THE SHIELD,nothing about the size of the shield is ascertained in this passage on

3374,THE SHIELD,_studien zur ilias_ p 21 the avoidance by ducking can be managed

3378,THE SHIELD,the assailants firing unexpectedly from a ditch a few moments of

3389,THE SHIELD,_odyssey_ xiv 475 odysseus says he slept within the shield he says
3390,THE SHIELD,under arms _odyssey_ xiv 474 but _cf_ xiv 479 maintains that

3394,THE SHIELD,these points why did not the homeric heroes ride because no man could
3395,THE SHIELD,carry such a shield on horseback footnote _iliad_ vol i p 573
3396,THE SHIELD,we reply that men could and did carry such shields on horseback as
3397,THE SHIELD,we know on the evidence of works of art and poetry of the eleventh to
3399,THE SHIELD,of chariots as the result of horses too small to carry a heavy and
3402,THE SHIELD,the shield greek aspis we are told by followers of reichel was
3403,THE SHIELD,only worn by princes who could afford to keep chariots charioteers
3404,THE SHIELD,and squires of the body to arm and disarm them but this can scarcely
3405,THE SHIELD,be true for all the comrades of diomede had the shield greek aspis
3406,THE SHIELD,_iliad_ x 152 and the whole host of pandarus of troy a noted
3408,THE SHIELD,90 and some of them held their shields greek sakae in front of
3409,THE SHIELD,pandarus when he took a treacherous shot at menelaus iv 113 the
3410,THE SHIELD,whole host could not have chariots and squires we may presume so the
3411,THE SHIELD,chariot was not indispensable to the _écuyer_ or shieldbearing man
3413,THE SHIELD,the objections to this conjecture of reichel are conspicuous as we now
3416,THE SHIELD,no mycenaean work of art shows us a shielded man in a chariot the men
3417,THE SHIELD,with the monstrous shields are always depicted on foot the only modern
3418,THE SHIELD,peoples who to our knowledge used a leather shield of the mycenaean
3419,THE SHIELD,size and even of a mycenaean shape had no horses and chariots as
3420,THE SHIELD,we shall show the ancient eastern peoples such as the khita and
3421,THE SHIELD,egyptians who fought from chariots carried _small_ shields of various
3422,THE SHIELD,forms as in the wellknown picture of a battle between the khita armed
3423,THE SHIELD,with spears and the bowmen of rameses ii who kill horse and man with
3424,THE SHIELD,arrows from their chariots and carry no spears while the khita who
3425,THE SHIELD,have no bows merely spears are shot down as they advance footnote
3426,THE SHIELD,maspero _hist ancienne_ ii p 225 egyptians and khita who fight
3427,THE SHIELD,from chariots use _small_ bucklers whence it follows that war chariots
3428,THE SHIELD,were not invented or at least were not retained in use for the
3429,THE SHIELD,purpose of giving mobility to men wearing gigantic shields under which
3430,THE SHIELD,they could not hurry from point to point war chariots did not cease to
3433,THE SHIELD,moreover homeric warriors can make marches under shield while there is
3434,THE SHIELD,no mention of chariots to carry them to the point where they are to
3435,THE SHIELD,lie in ambush odyssey xiv 470510 if the shield was so heavy as
3436,THE SHIELD,to render a chariot necessary would homer make hector trudge a
3438,THE SHIELD,sprints thrice round the whole circumference of troy helbig notices
3439,THE SHIELD,several other cases of long runs under shield either reichel is wrong
3440,THE SHIELD,when he said that the huge shield made the use of the war chariot
3441,THE SHIELD,necessary or the poet is late he is a man who never saw a large
3442,THE SHIELD,shield like hectors and though he speaks of such shields he thinks
3443,THE SHIELD,that men could walk and run under them when men did walk or run under
3444,THE SHIELD,shield or ride if they ever rode they would hang it over the left
3445,THE SHIELD,side like the lionhunters on the famous inlaid dagger of mycenae
3447,THE SHIELD,120_ff_ wien 1901 or the warrior on the chessman referred to above
3450,THE SHIELD,aias again the big brave stupid porthos of the _iliad_ has the
3451,THE SHIELD,largest shield of all like a tower this shield cannot have been
3452,THE SHIELD,circular and is recognised by his shield but he never enters a
3453,THE SHIELD,chariot and like odysseus has none of his own because both men come
3454,THE SHIELD,from rugged islands unfit for chariot driving odysseus has plenty
3455,THE SHIELD,of shields in his house in ithaca as we learn from the account of the
3456,THE SHIELD,battle with the wooers in the _odyssey_ yet in ithaca as at troy he
3457,THE SHIELD,kept no chariot here then we have nations who fight from chariots
3458,THE SHIELD,yet use small shields and heroes who wear enormous shields yet never
3459,THE SHIELD,own a chariot clearly the great shield cannot have been the cause of
3460,THE SHIELD,the use of the war chariot as in the theory of reichel
3462,THE SHIELD,aias and his shield we meet in _iliad_ vii 206220 he clothed
3463,THE SHIELD,himself upon his flesh in _all_ his armour greek teuchea to quote
3464,THE SHIELD,mr leafs translation but the poet only _describes_ his shield
3465,THE SHIELD,his towerlike shield of bronze with sevenfold oxhide that tychius
3466,THE SHIELD,wrought him cunningly tychius the best of curriers that had his home
3467,THE SHIELD,in hyle who made for him his glancing shield of sevenfold hides of
3470,THE SHIELD,the shield known to homer then is in this case so tall as to resemble
3471,THE SHIELD,a tower and has bronze plating over bulls hide by tradition from an
3472,THE SHIELD,age of leather shields the currier is still the shieldmaker though now
3473,THE SHIELD,the shield has metal plating it is fairly clear that greek tradition
3474,THE SHIELD,regarded the shield of aias as of the kind which covered the body from
3475,THE SHIELD,chin to ankles and resembled a bellying sail or an umbrella unfurled
3476,THE SHIELD,and drawn in at the sides in the middle so as to offer the semblance
3477,THE SHIELD,of two bellies or of one pinched in at or near the centre this is
3478,THE SHIELD,probable because the coins of salamis where aias was worshipped as a
3479,THE SHIELD,local hero of great influence display this shield as the badge of the
3480,THE SHIELD,aeginetan dynasty claiming descent from aias the shield is bossed
3481,THE SHIELD,or bellied out with two halfmoons cut in the centre representing the
3482,THE SHIELD,_waist_ or pinchedin part of the ancient mycenaean shield the same
3483,THE SHIELD,device occurs on a mycenaean ring from aegina in the british museum
3486,THE SHIELD,in a duel with aias the spear of hector pierced the bronze and six
3487,THE SHIELD,layers of hide on his shield but stuck in the seventh the spear of
3488,THE SHIELD,aias went through the circular or every way balanced huge shield
3489,THE SHIELD,of hector and through his corslet and _chiton_ but hector had doubled
3490,THE SHIELD,himself up laterally greek eklinthae vii 254 and was not
3491,THE SHIELD,wounded the next stroke of aias pierced his shield and wounded his
3492,THE SHIELD,neck hector replied with a boulder that lighted on the centre of the
3493,THE SHIELD,shield of aias on the boss whether that means a mere ornament or
3494,THE SHIELD,knob or whether it was the genuine bosswhich is disputed aias broke
3495,THE SHIELD,in the shield of hector with another stone and the gentle and joyous
3498,THE SHIELD,the shield of agamemnon was of the kind that cover all the body of
3499,THE SHIELD,a man and was every way equal or circular it was plated
3500,THE SHIELD,with twelve circles of bronze and had twenty greek omphaloi or
3501,THE SHIELD,ornamental knobs of tin and the centre was of black cyanus xi
3502,THE SHIELD,3134 there was also a head of the gorgon with fear and panic the
3503,THE SHIELD,description is not intelligible and i do not discuss it
3505,THE SHIELD,a man could be stabbed in the middle of the belly under his shield
3506,THE SHIELD,xi 424425 not an easy thing to do if shields covered the whole
3507,THE SHIELD,body to the feet but when a hero was leaping from his chariot as in
3508,THE SHIELD,this case no doubt a spear could be pushed up under the shield
3509,THE SHIELD,the ancient irish romances tell of a _gae bulg_ a spear held in the
3510,THE SHIELD,warriors toes and jerked up under the shield of his enemy shields
3511,THE SHIELD,could be held up on high in an attack on a wall garrisoned by archers
3512,THE SHIELD,xii 139 the great norman shield also could be thus lifted
3514,THE SHIELD,the locrians light armed infantry had no shields nor bronze helmets
3515,THE SHIELD,nor spears but slings and bows xiii 714 mr leaf suspects that this
3516,THE SHIELD,is a piece of false archaism but we do not think that early poets
3517,THE SHIELD,in an uncritical age are ever archaeologists good or bad the poet is
3518,THE SHIELD,aware that some men have larger some smaller shields just as some have
3519,THE SHIELD,longer and some shorter spears xiv 370377 but this does not prove
3520,THE SHIELD,that the shields were of different types a tall man might inherit the

4081,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,mycenaean shield is inconsistent with that of the metal breastplate
4082,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,the shield covers the wearer in a way which makes a breastplate an
4083,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,useless encumbrance or rather it is ignorance of the breastplate which
4084,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,alone can explain the use of such frightfully cumbrous gear as the huge
4087,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,but the algonquins and iroquois wore such breastplates as they could
4088,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,manufacture though they also used shields of great size suspended in

4090,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,the knights of the eleventh century ad in addition to very large
4091,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,shields wore ponderous hauberks or byrnies as we shall prove
4092,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,presently as this combination of great shield with corslet was common
4093,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,and natural we cannot agree with mr leaf when he says it follows
4094,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,that the homeric warriors wore no metal breastplate and that all
4095,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,the passages where the greek thoraes is mentioned are either later
4096,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,interpolations or refer to some other sort of armour which _ex
4102,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,the facts speak for themselves the largest shields are not exclusive

4104,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,red indians and the mediaeval chivalry of europe the use of the aspis
4105,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,in homer therefore throws no suspicion on the concomitant use of the
4106,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,corslet the really surprising fact would be if late poets who knew
4107,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,only small round bucklers never introduced them into the poems but
4108,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,always spoke of enormous shields while they at the same time did
4109,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,introduce corslets unknown to the early poems which they continued
4110,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,clearly reichels theory is ill inspired and inconsistent this becomes
4111,ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHIELDS,plain as soon as we trace the evolution of shields and corslets in

4185,THE BREASTPLATE,in the mycenaean age when so far as art shows _chitons_ were not worn
4186,THE BREASTPLATE,at all or very little and scarcely ever in battle and when we know

4198,THE BREASTPLATE,corslets with which they were familiar mr myres supposes that the line
4199,THE BREASTPLATE,about the greek poludaidalos corslet was already old but had merely

4221,THE BREASTPLATE,mr myres applauds reichels theory that blank space first meant
4222,THE BREASTPLATE,a mans chest if _thorex_ means a mans breast then _thorex_ in a
4223,THE BREASTPLATE,secondary sense one thinks would mean breastplate as waist of a
4224,THE BREASTPLATE,woman means first her waist next her blouse american but mr
4225,THE BREASTPLATE,myres and reichel say that the secondary sense of _thorex_ is not
4226,THE BREASTPLATE,breastplate but body clothing as if a man were all breast or wore
4227,THE BREASTPLATE,only a breast covering whereas mycenaean art shows men wearing nothing
4228,THE BREASTPLATE,on their breasts merely drawers or loincloths which could not be
4229,THE BREASTPLATE,called _thorex_ as they cover the antipodes of the breast
4231,THE BREASTPLATE,the verb greek thoraesestai the theory runs on merely meant to
4232,THE BREASTPLATE,put on body clothing which mycenaeans in works of art if correctly
4233,THE BREASTPLATE,represented do not usually put on they fought naked or in bathing
4234,THE BREASTPLATE,drawers surely we might as well argue that a waistcoat might come
4235,THE BREASTPLATE,to mean body clothing in general as that a word for the male breast
4236,THE BREASTPLATE,became first a synonym for the covering of the male buttocks and for
4237,THE BREASTPLATE,apparel in general and next for a bronze breastplate these arguments
4239,THE BREASTPLATE,vol xx pp 149 150 nor does mycenaean art instruct us that men went
4240,THE BREASTPLATE,into battle dressed in body clothing which was thickly set with many
4243,THE BREASTPLATE,further if we follow reichel and mr leaf the mycenaeans wore
4245,THE BREASTPLATE,shields though of this we have no evidence taking the bronzeplated
4246,THE BREASTPLATE, shield to stand poetically for the _chiton_ the poet spoke of _the
4247,THE BREASTPLATE,bronzechitoned achaeans_ but if we follow mr myres the mycenaeans
4248,THE BREASTPLATE,also applied the word _thorex_ to body clothing at large in place of
4249,THE BREASTPLATE,the word _chiton_ and when a warrior was transfixed by a spear they
4251,THE BREASTPLATE,body clothing in general was pierced it does seem simpler to hold
4252,THE BREASTPLATE,that _chiton_ meant _chiton_ that _thorex_ meant first breast then
4253,THE BREASTPLATE,breastplate whether of linen or plaited leather or bronze and
4254,THE BREASTPLATE,that to pierce a man through his greek poludaidalos thoraex meant to
4255,THE BREASTPLATE,pierce him through his handsome corslet no mortal ever dreamt that this
4256,THE BREASTPLATE,was so till reichel tried to make out that the original poet describes
4257,THE BREASTPLATE,no armour except the large mycenaean shield and the _mitrê_ and that
4258,THE BREASTPLATE,all corslets in the poems were of much later introduction possibly they
4259,THE BREASTPLATE,were but they had plenty of time wherein to be evolved long before the
4262,THE BREASTPLATE,the argument is that a man with a large shield needs no body armour or
4265,THE BREASTPLATE,but the possession and use of a large shield did not in the middle ages
4266,THE BREASTPLATE,or among the iroquois and algonquins make men dispense with corslets

4372,THE BREASTPLATE,a bronze _chiton_ might stop a spear of which the impetus was spent in
4373,THE BREASTPLATE,penetrating the shield but homeric corslets did not as a rule avail
4374,THE BREASTPLATE,to keep out a spear driven by the hand at close quarters or powerfully
4375,THE BREASTPLATE,thrown from a short distance even the later greek corslets do not look
4376,THE BREASTPLATE,as if they could resist a heavy spear wielded by a strong hand
4378,THE BREASTPLATE,i proceed to show that the homeric corslet did not avail against a
4379,THE BREASTPLATE,spear at close quarters but could turn an arrow point once and could
4380,THE BREASTPLATE,sometimes turn a spear which had perforated a shield so far and not
4381,THE BREASTPLATE,further the homeric corslet was serviceable but if a warriors breast
4382,THE BREASTPLATE,or back was not covered by the shield and received a thrust at close
4383,THE BREASTPLATE,quarters the corslet was pierced more easily than the pad of paper

4416,THE BREASTPLATE,neither is the shield mentioned this constantly occurs and we cannot
4417,THE BREASTPLATE,argue that hypsenor wore no corslet unless we are also to contend that
4418,THE BREASTPLATE,he wore no shield or a small shield idomeneus drives his spear through
4419,THE BREASTPLATE,the _bronze chiton_ of alcathöus xiii 439 440 mr leaf reckons
4420,THE BREASTPLATE,these lines probably an interpolation to turn the linen _chiton_ the
4421,THE BREASTPLATE,rending of which is the sign of triumph into a bronze corslet but we
4422,THE BREASTPLATE,ask why if an editor or rhapsodist went through the _iliad_ introducing
4423,THE BREASTPLATE,corslets he so often left them out where the critics detect their
4426,THE BREASTPLATE,the spear of idomeneus pierces another feeble corslet over the victims
4427,THE BREASTPLATE,belly xiii 506508 it is quite a surprise when a corslet does for
4428,THE BREASTPLATE,once avail to turn an arrow xiii 586587 but aias drives his spear
4429,THE BREASTPLATE,through the corslet of phorcys into his belly xvii 311312 thus the
4430,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet scarcely ever by itself protects a hero it never protects
4431,THE BREASTPLATE,him against an unspent spear even when his shield stands between his
4432,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet and the spear both are sometimes perforated yet occasionally
4433,THE BREASTPLATE,the corslet saves a man when the spear has gone through the shield the
4434,THE BREASTPLATE,poet therefore sometimes gives us a man pierced in a part which the
4435,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet covers without mentioning the flimsy article that could not
4438,THE BREASTPLATE,reichel himself came to see before his regretted death that he could
4439,THE BREASTPLATE,not explain away the _thorex_ or corslet on his original lines as a
4440,THE BREASTPLATE,mere general name for a piece of armour and he inclined to think that
4441,THE BREASTPLATE,jacks with metal plates sewn on did exist before the ionian corslet
4443,THE BREASTPLATE,of the mycenaean graves pointed in this direction but his general
4444,THE BREASTPLATE,argument is that corslets were interpolated into the old lays by poets
4445,THE BREASTPLATE,of a corsletwearing age and mr leaf holds that corslets may have
4446,THE BREASTPLATE,filtered in during the course of successive modernisation such as the
4447,THE BREASTPLATE,oldest parts of the _iliad_ seem in many cases to have passed through
4448,THE BREASTPLATE,footnote leaf iliad i p 578 though the new poets were for all
4449,THE BREASTPLATE,that conservatively tenacious of the old material we have already
4452,THE BREASTPLATE,the poets who did not introduce the new small bucklers with which they
4453,THE BREASTPLATE,were familiar did stuff the _iliad_ full of corslets unknown by
4454,THE BREASTPLATE,the theory to the original poet but familiar to rhapsodists living
4455,THE BREASTPLATE,centuries later why if they were bent on modernising did they not
4456,THE BREASTPLATE,modernise the shields and how if they modernised unconsciously as all
4457,THE BREASTPLATE,uncritical poets do did the shield fail to be unconsciously brought up
4458,THE BREASTPLATE,to date it seems probable that homer lived at a period when both huge
4461,THE BREASTPLATE,we shall now examine some of the passages in which mr leaf mainly
4462,THE BREASTPLATE,following reichel raises difficulties about corslets we do not know
4463,THE BREASTPLATE,their mechanism they were composed of greek guala presumed to be a
4464,THE BREASTPLATE,backplate and a breastplate the word _gualon_ appears to mean a hollow
4465,THE BREASTPLATE,or the converse something convex we cannot understand the mechanism
4466,THE BREASTPLATE,see a young man putting on a corslet on an amphora by euthymides
4467,THE BREASTPLATE,walter vol ii p 176 but if late poets familiar with such
4468,THE BREASTPLATE,corslets did not understand how they worked they were very dull men
4469,THE BREASTPLATE,when their descriptions puzzle us that is more probably because we are
4470,THE BREASTPLATE,not at the point of view than because poets interpolated mentions of
4471,THE BREASTPLATE,pieces of armour which they did not understand and therefore cannot
4472,THE BREASTPLATE,have been familiar with and in that case would not introduce
4474,THE BREASTPLATE,mr leaf starts with a passage in the _iliad_ iii 357360it recurs
4475,THE BREASTPLATE,in another case through the bright shield went the ponderous
4477,THE BREASTPLATE,poludaidalou breastplate it pressed on and straight beside his flank
4478,THE BREASTPLATE,it rent the tunic but he swerved and escaped black death mr
4479,THE BREASTPLATE,leaf says it is obvious that after a spear has passed through a
4480,THE BREASTPLATE,breastplate there is no longer any possibility for the wearer to bend
4481,THE BREASTPLATE,aside and so to avoid the point but i suppose that the wearer by a
4482,THE BREASTPLATE,motion very natural doubled up sideways so to speak and so the spear
4483,THE BREASTPLATE,merely grazed his flesh that is what i suppose the poet to intend
4484,THE BREASTPLATE,the more he knew of corslets the less would he mention an impossible
4487,THE BREASTPLATE,again in many cases the late poets by the theorythough it is they
4488,THE BREASTPLATE,who bring the corslets inleave the corslets out a man without shield
4489,THE BREASTPLATE,helmet and spear calls himself naked why did not these late poets
4490,THE BREASTPLATE,it is asked make him take off his corslet if he had one as well as
4491,THE BREASTPLATE,his shield the case occurs in xxii 111113124125 hector thinks of
4492,THE BREASTPLATE,laying aside helmet spear and shield and of parleying with achilles
4493,THE BREASTPLATE,but then he will slay me naked that is unarmed he still had his
4494,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet the critics say so how could he be naked or if he had
4495,THE BREASTPLATE,no corslet this is a passage uncontaminated by the late poets of the
4496,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet age now certainly hector _was_ wearing a corslet which he
4497,THE BREASTPLATE,had taken from patroclus that is the essence of the story he would
4498,THE BREASTPLATE,however be naked or unprotected if he laid aside helmet spear and
4499,THE BREASTPLATE,shield because achilles could hit him in the head or neck as he did
4500,THE BREASTPLATE,or lightly drive the spear through the corslet which we have proved
4501,THE BREASTPLATE,was no sound defence against a spear at close quarters though useful
4505,THE BREASTPLATE,we next learn that no corslet occurs in the _odyssey_ or in _iliad_
4506,THE BREASTPLATE,book x called very late mr leaf suggests that it is of the seventh
4507,THE BREASTPLATE,century bc but if the odyssey and iliad book x are really very
4509,THE BREASTPLATE,with ionian corslets why did they leave corslets out while their
4510,THE BREASTPLATE,predecessors and contemporaries were introducing them all up and down
4511,THE BREASTPLATE,the _iliad_ in fact in book x no prince is regularly equipped they
4512,THE BREASTPLATE,have been called up to deliberate in the dead of night and when two go
4513,THE BREASTPLATE,as spies they wear casual borrowed gear it is more important that no
4514,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet is mentioned in nestors arms in his tent but are we to explain
4515,THE BREASTPLATE,this and the absence of mention of corslets in the odyssey where there
4516,THE BREASTPLATE,is little about regular fighting on the ground that the author of
4517,THE BREASTPLATE,_iliad_ book x and all the many authors and editors of the
4519,THE BREASTPLATE,contemporaries the later poets and interpolators of the _iliad_ had
4520,THE BREASTPLATE,formed the theory that corslets were not known at the time of the siege
4521,THE BREASTPLATE,of troy and therefore must not be mentioned this is quite incredible
4522,THE BREASTPLATE,no hypothesis can be more improbable we cannot imagine late ionian
4523,THE BREASTPLATE,rhapsodists listening to the _iliad_ and saying these poets of the
4524,THE BREASTPLATE,_iliad_ are all wrong at the date of the mycenaean prime as every
4525,THE BREASTPLATE,educated man knows corslets were not yet in fashion so we must have no
4528,THE BREASTPLATE,a modern critic who thinks this possible is bringing the practice
4529,THE BREASTPLATE,of archaising poets of the late nineteenth century into the minds of
4530,THE BREASTPLATE,rhapsodists of the eighth century before christ artists of the middle
4531,THE BREASTPLATE,of the sixteenth century always depict jeanne darc in the armour and
4532,THE BREASTPLATE,costume of their own time wholly unlike those of 1430 this is the
4533,THE BREASTPLATE,regular rule late rhapsodists would not delve in the archaeology of the
4534,THE BREASTPLATE,mycenaean prime indeed one does not see how they could discover in
4535,THE BREASTPLATE,asia that corslets were not worn five centuries earlier on the other
4538,THE BREASTPLATE,we are told that aias and some other heroes are never spoken of as
4539,THE BREASTPLATE,wearing corslets but aias certainly did put on a set of pieces of
4540,THE BREASTPLATE,armour and did not trust to his shield alone towerlike as it was the
4541,THE BREASTPLATE,description runs thus the achaeans have disarmed before the duel of
4542,THE BREASTPLATE,aias and hector aias draws the lucky lot he is to meet hector and
4543,THE BREASTPLATE,bids the others pray to zeus while i clothe me in my armour of battle
4544,THE BREASTPLATE,while they prayed aias arrayed himself in flashing bronze and when
4545,THE BREASTPLATE,he had now clothed upon his flesh _all_ his pieces of armour greek
4546,THE BREASTPLATE,panta teuchae he went forth to fight if aias wore only a shield as
4547,THE BREASTPLATE,on mr leafs hypothesis he could sling it on before the achaeans could
4548,THE BREASTPLATE,breathe a _pater noster_ his sword he would not have taken off swords
4549,THE BREASTPLATE,were always worn what then are all his pieces of armour vii 193
4552,THE BREASTPLATE,carl robert cites passages in which the greek teuchea taken from
4553,THE BREASTPLATE,the shoulders include corslets and are late and ionian with other
4554,THE BREASTPLATE,passages which are mycenaean with no corslet involved he adds about
4555,THE BREASTPLATE,twenty more passages in which greek teuchea include corslets among
4556,THE BREASTPLATE,these references two are from the _doloneia_ x 254 272 where
4557,THE BREASTPLATE,reichel finds no mention of corslets how robert can tell greek
4559,THE BREASTPLATE,corslets is not obvious but at all events he does see corslets as
4560,THE BREASTPLATE,in vii 122 where reichel sees none footnote robert _studien zur
4563,THE BREASTPLATE,it is a strong point with mr leaf that we never hear of the corslet in

4578,THE BREASTPLATE,idomeneus is never named as wearing a corslet but he remarks that he
4579,THE BREASTPLATE,has plenty of corslets xiii 264 and in this and many cases opponents
4580,THE BREASTPLATE,of corslets prove their case by cutting out the lines which disprove it
4581,THE BREASTPLATE,anything may be demonstrated if we may excise whatever passage does
4582,THE BREASTPLATE,not suit our hypothesis it is impossible to argue against this logical
4583,THE BREASTPLATE,device especially when the critic not satisfied with a clean cut
4584,THE BREASTPLATE,supposes that some late enthusiast for corslets altered the prayer of
4585,THE BREASTPLATE,thetis to hephaestus for the very purpose of dragging in a corslet
4586,THE BREASTPLATE,footnote leaf note to _iliad_ xviii 460 461 if there is no
4587,THE BREASTPLATE,objection to a line except that a corslet occurs in it where is the
4588,THE BREASTPLATE,logic in excising the line because one happens to think that corslets
4591,THE BREASTPLATE,another plan is to maintain that if the poet does not in any case
4592,THE BREASTPLATE,mention a corslet there was no corslet thus in v 99 an arrow strikes
4593,THE BREASTPLATE,diomede hard by the right shoulder the plate of the corslet thirteen
4594,THE BREASTPLATE,lines later v 112 113 sthenelus drew the swift shaft right through
4595,THE BREASTPLATE,out of diomedes shoulder and the blood darted up through the pliant
4596,THE BREASTPLATE,_chiton_ we do not know what the word here translated pliant greek
4597,THE BREASTPLATE,streptos means and aristarchus seems to have thought it was a coat of
4598,THE BREASTPLATE,mail chain or scale armour if so here is the corslet but in this
4599,THE BREASTPLATE,case if a corslet or jack with intertwisted small plates or scales or
4600,THE BREASTPLATE,rings of bronze be meant _gualon_ cannot mean a large plate as
4601,THE BREASTPLATE,it does mr ridgeway says it seems certain that greek streptos
4602,THE BREASTPLATE,chitoon means as aristarchus held a shirt of mail footnote _early
4603,THE BREASTPLATE,age of greece_ vol i p 306 mr leaf says just the reverse as
4604,THE BREASTPLATE,usual we come to a deadlock a clash of learned opinion but any one
4605,THE BREASTPLATE,can see that in the space of thirteen lines no poet or interpolator
4606,THE BREASTPLATE,who wrote v i 12 i 13 could forget that diomede was said to be wearing
4607,THE BREASTPLATE,a corslet in v 99 and even if the poet could forget which is out of
4608,THE BREASTPLATE,the question the editor of 540 bc was simply defrauding his employer
4609,THE BREASTPLATE,piaistratus if he did not bring a remedy for the stupid fault of the
4610,THE BREASTPLATE,poet when this or that hero is not specifically said to be wearing a
4611,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet it is usually because the poet has no occasion to mention it
4612,THE BREASTPLATE,though as we have seen a man is occasionally smitten in the midriff
4613,THE BREASTPLATE,say without any remark on the flimsy piece of mail
4615,THE BREASTPLATE,that corslets are usually taken for granted as present by the poet
4616,THE BREASTPLATE,even when they are not explicitly named seems certain he constantly
4617,THE BREASTPLATE,represents the heroes as stripping the pieces of mail greek
4618,THE BREASTPLATE,teuchea when they have time and opportunity from fallen foes if only
4619,THE BREASTPLATE,the shield is taken if there is nothing else in the way of bronze body
4620,THE BREASTPLATE,armour to take why have we the plural greek teuchea the corslet
4621,THE BREASTPLATE,as well as the shield must be intended the stripping is usually from
4622,THE BREASTPLATE,the shoulders and it is from his shoulders that hector hopes to
4623,THE BREASTPLATE,strip the corslet of diomede iliad viii 195 in a passage to be
4624,THE BREASTPLATE,sure which the critics think interpolated however this may be the
4625,THE BREASTPLATE,stripping of the same greek characters cannot be the mere seizure of
4626,THE BREASTPLATE,the shield but must refer to other pieces of armour all the pieces
4627,THE BREASTPLATE,of armour so other pieces of defensive armour besides the shield are
4628,THE BREASTPLATE,throughout taken for granted if they were not there they could not be
4629,THE BREASTPLATE,stripped it is the chitons that agamemnon does something to in the
4630,THE BREASTPLATE,case of two fallen foes _iliad_ xi 100 and aristarchus thought that
4631,THE BREASTPLATE,these _chitons_ were corslets but the passage is obscure in _iliad_
4632,THE BREASTPLATE,xi 373 when diomede strips helmet from head shield from shoulder
4633,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet from breast of agastrophus reichel was for excising the
4634,THE BREASTPLATE,corslet because it was not mentioned when the hero was struck on the
4635,THE BREASTPLATE,hip joint i do not see that an inefficient corslet would protect the
4636,THE BREASTPLATE,hip joint to do that in our eighteenth century cavalry armour was the
4637,THE BREASTPLATE,business of a _zoster_ as may be seen in a portrait of the chevalier de
4638,THE BREASTPLATE,st george in youth it is a thick ribbed _zoster_ that protects the hip
4641,THE BREASTPLATE,finally mr evans observes that the western invaders of egypt under
4642,THE BREASTPLATE,rameses iii are armed on the monuments with cuirasses formed of a
4643,THE BREASTPLATE,succession of plates horizontal or rising in a double curve while
4645,THE BREASTPLATE,of corslet _zoster_ and _zoma_ as articles of defensive armour
4647,THE BREASTPLATE,discoveries says mr evans thus supply a double corroboration of the
4648,THE BREASTPLATE,homeric tradition which carries back the use of the round shield and the
4649,THE BREASTPLATE,cuirass or greek thoraex to the earlier epic period with such
4650,THE BREASTPLATE,a representation before us a series of homeric passages on which dr
4654,THE BREASTPLATE,homer then describes armour _later_ than that of the mycenaean prime
4655,THE BREASTPLATE,when as far as works of art show only a huge leathern shield was
4656,THE BREASTPLATE,carried though the gold breastplates of the corpses in the grave
4657,THE BREASTPLATE,suggest that corslets existed homers men on the other hand have
4658,THE BREASTPLATE,at least in certain cases quoted above large bronzeplated shields and
4659,THE BREASTPLATE,bronze cuirasses of no great resisting power perhaps in various stages
4660,THE BREASTPLATE,of evolution from the byrnie with scales or small plates of bronze to
4661,THE BREASTPLATE,the breastplate and backplate though the plates for breast and back
4664,THE BREASTPLATE,it seems that some critics cannot divest themselves of the idea that
4665,THE BREASTPLATE,the original poet of the kernel was contemporary with them who slept
4666,THE BREASTPLATE,in the shaft graves of mycenae covered with golden ornaments and that
4667,THE BREASTPLATE,for body armour he only knew their monstrous shields mr leaf writes
4668,THE BREASTPLATE,the armour of homeric heroes corresponds closely to that of the
4669,THE BREASTPLATE,mykenaean age as we learn it from the monuments the heroes wore no
4673,THE BREASTPLATE,this is only true if we excise all the passages which contradict the
4674,THE BREASTPLATE,statement and go on with mr leaf to say by the seventh century bc
4675,THE BREASTPLATE,or thereabouts the idea of a panoply without a breastplate had become
4676,THE BREASTPLATE,absurd by that time the epic poems had almost ceased to grow but they
4677,THE BREASTPLATE,still admitted a few minor episodes in which the round shield where
4678,THE BREASTPLATE, and corslet played a part as well as the interpolation of a certain
4679,THE BREASTPLATE,number of lines and couplets in which the new armament was mechanically
4683,THE BREASTPLATE,on the other hand mr leaf says that the small circular shield of
4684,THE BREASTPLATE,later times is unknown to homer with a very few curious exceptions
4685,THE BREASTPLATE,in which the shields are not said to be small or circular footnote
4688,THE BREASTPLATE,surely this is rather arbitrary dealing we start from our theory that
4689,THE BREASTPLATE,the original poet described the armour of the monuments though
4690,THE BREASTPLATE,_they_ are of the prime while he professedly lived long after the
4691,THE BREASTPLATE,primelived in an age when there must have been changes in military
4692,THE BREASTPLATE,equipment we then cut out as of the seventh century whatever passages
4693,THE BREASTPLATE,do not suit our theory anybody can prove anything by this method we
4694,THE BREASTPLATE,might say that the siege scene on the mycenaean silver vase represents
4695,THE BREASTPLATE,the mycenaean prime and that as there is but one jersey among
4696,THE BREASTPLATE,eight men otherwise stark naked we must cut out seveneighths of the
4697,THE BREASTPLATE,_chitons_ in the _iliad_ these having been interpolated by late poets
4698,THE BREASTPLATE,who did not run about with nothing on we might call the whole poem
4699,THE BREASTPLATE,late because the authors know nothing of the mycenaean bathingdrawers
4700,THE BREASTPLATE,so common on the monuments the argument compels mr leaf to assume
4701,THE BREASTPLATE,that a shield can be called greek teuchea in the plural so in
4702,THE BREASTPLATE,_iliad_ vii 122 when the squires of menelaus take the greek
4703,THE BREASTPLATE,teuchea from his shoulders we are assured that the shield aspis
4704,THE BREASTPLATE,was for the chiefs alone we have seen that all the host of pandarus
4705,THE BREASTPLATE,wore shields for those who could keep a chariot to carry them and
4706,THE BREASTPLATE,squires to assist them in taking off this ponderous defence see vii
4709,THE BREASTPLATE,we do see vii 122 and find that not a _single_ shield but pieces of
4710,THE BREASTPLATE,gear in the plural number were taken off menelaus the feeblest warrior
4711,THE BREASTPLATE,without any assistance could stoop his head and put it through the belt
4712,THE BREASTPLATE,of his shield as an angler takes off his fishing creel and there he
4713,THE BREASTPLATE,was totally disarmed no squire was needed to disarm him any more
4714,THE BREASTPLATE,than to disarm girard in the _chancun de willame_ nobody explains why
4715,THE BREASTPLATE,a shield is spoken of as a number of things in the plural and that
4716,THE BREASTPLATE,constantly and in lines where if the poet means a shield prosody
4717,THE BREASTPLATE,permits him to _say_ a shield greek therapontes ap oopoon aspid
4720,THE BREASTPLATE,it really does appear that reichels logic his power of visualising
4721,THE BREASTPLATE,simple things and processes and his knowledge of the evolution
4722,THE BREASTPLATE,of defensive armour everywhere were not equal to his industry and
4723,THE BREASTPLATE,classical erudition homer seems to describe what he saw shields often
4724,THE BREASTPLATE,of great size made of leather plated with bronze and suspended by
4725,THE BREASTPLATE,belts and for body armour feeble bronze corslets and _zosters_ there
4726,THE BREASTPLATE,is nothing inconsistent in all this there was no more reason why an
4727,THE BREASTPLATE,homeric warrior should not wear a corslet as well as a shield than there
4728,THE BREASTPLATE,was reason why a mediaeval knight who carried a _targe_ should not also
4729,THE BREASTPLATE,wear a hauberk or why an iroquois with a shield should not also
4730,THE BREASTPLATE,wear his cotton or wickerwork armour defensive gear kept pace with
4731,THE BREASTPLATE,offensive weapons a big leather shield could keep out stonetipped
4732,THE BREASTPLATE,arrows but as bronzetipped arrows came in and also heavy
4734,THE BREASTPLATE,the shield was plated with bronze and if it did not exist before the
4737,THE BREASTPLATE,to keep out stonetipped arrows was the business of the mycenaean wooden
4738,THE BREASTPLATE,or leather shield bronze arrowheads so common in the _iliad_
4742,THE BREASTPLATE,there was thus as far as arrows went no reason why mycenaean shields
4743,THE BREASTPLATE,should be plated with bronze if the piece of wood in grave v was a
4744,THE BREASTPLATE,shield as seems probable what has become of its bronze plates if it
4745,THE BREASTPLATE,had any footnote schuchardt p 269 gold ornaments which could only

4752,THE BREASTPLATE,but developed and advanced as the means of attack improved
4754,THE BREASTPLATE,where everything is so natural it seems fantastic to explain the

4763,THE BREASTPLATE,very late developments of the epic may happen to demand at this or that
4766,THE BREASTPLATE,again mr leaf informs us that the first rhapsodies were born in the

4777,THE BREASTPLATE,of greaves and corslets while he sometimes actually goes behind
4778,THE BREASTPLATE,tradition to find mycenaean things unknown to the original poets
4781,THE BREASTPLATE,cannot possibly be accepted the late poets of the theory are in
4782,THE BREASTPLATE,the iron age and are of course familiar with iron weapons yet in
4783,THE BREASTPLATE,conservative deference to tradition they keep them absolutely out of
4784,THE BREASTPLATE,their rhapsodies they are equally familiar with bronze corslets so
4785,THE BREASTPLATE,reckless this time of tradition they thrust them even into rhapsodies
4786,THE BREASTPLATE,which are centuries older than their own day they are no less familiar
4787,THE BREASTPLATE,with small bucklers yet they say nothing about them and cling to
4789,THE BREASTPLATE,theories which we have been examining is easily discovered the scholars
4790,THE BREASTPLATE,who hold these opinions see that several things in the homeric picture
4791,THE BREASTPLATE,of life are based on mycenaean facts for example the size of the
4792,THE BREASTPLATE,shields and their suspension by baldrics but the scholars also do
4794,THE BREASTPLATE,be no _long_ epic in the early period therefore the greater part much
4795,THE BREASTPLATE,the greater part of the _iliad_ must necessarily they say be the work
4797,THE BREASTPLATE,this belief by the discovery of inconsistencies in the epic which
4798,THE BREASTPLATE,they assume can only be explained as the result of a compilation of the
4799,THE BREASTPLATE,patchwork of ages but as on this theory many men in many lands and
4800,THE BREASTPLATE,ages made the epic their contributions cannot but be marked by the
4802,THE BREASTPLATE,weapons and so on which could not but arise in the long process of
4803,THE BREASTPLATE,time yet traces of change in law religion manners and customs are
4804,THE BREASTPLATE,scarcely if at all to be detected whence it logically follows that a
4807,THE BREASTPLATE,their erudite conservatism for example induced them in deference to
4808,THE BREASTPLATE,the traditions of the bronze age to describe all weapons as of bronze
4809,THE BREASTPLATE,though many of the poets were living in an age of weapons of iron it
4810,THE BREASTPLATE,also prompted them to describe all shields as made on the faraway old
4811,THE BREASTPLATE,mycenaean model though they were themselves used to small circular
4812,THE BREASTPLATE,bucklers with a bracer and a grip worn on the left arm
4814,THE BREASTPLATE,but at this point the learning and conservatism of the late poets
4815,THE BREASTPLATE,deserted them and into their new lays also into the old lays they
4817,THE BREASTPLATE,the ninth to seventh centuries we shall find helbig stating on the
4818,THE BREASTPLATE,same page that in the matter of usages the epic poets shunned as far
4819,THE BREASTPLATE,as possible all that was recent and also that for fear of puzzling
4820,THE BREASTPLATE,their military audiences they did the reverse they probably kept
4821,THE BREASTPLATE,account of the arms and armour of their own day footnote la
4822,THE BREASTPLATE,_question mycénienne_ p 50 _cf_ note i now the late poets on
4823,THE BREASTPLATE,this showing must have puzzled warriors who used iron weapons by always
4824,THE BREASTPLATE,speaking of bronze weapons they pleased the critical warriors on the
4825,THE BREASTPLATE,other hand by introducing the corslets and greaves which every military
4826,THE BREASTPLATE,man of their late age possessed but again the poets startled an
4827,THE BREASTPLATE,audience which used light bucklers worn on the left arm by talking of
4830,THE BREASTPLATE,all these inconsistencies of theory follow from the assumption that the
4831,THE BREASTPLATE,_iliad_ _must_ be a hotchpotch of many ages if we assume that on the
4832,THE BREASTPLATE,whole it is the work of one age we see that the poet describes the
4833,THE BREASTPLATE,usages which obtained in his own day the dead are cremated not as in
4834,THE BREASTPLATE,the mycenaean prime inhumed the shield has been strengthened to meet
4835,THE BREASTPLATE,bronze not stonetipped arrows by bronze plates corslets and greaves
4836,THE BREASTPLATE,have been elaborated bronze however is still the metal for swords and
4837,THE BREASTPLATE,spears and even occasionally for tools and implements though these are
4838,THE BREASTPLATE,often of iron in short we have in homer a picture of a transitional
4839,THE BREASTPLATE,age of culture we have not a medley of old and new of obsolete and
4840,THE BREASTPLATE,modern the poets do not describe inhumation as they should do if they
4841,THE BREASTPLATE,are conservative archaeologists in that case though they burn they
4842,THE BREASTPLATE,would have made their heroes bury their dead as they did at mycenas
4843,THE BREASTPLATE,they do not introduce iron swords and spears as they must do if being
4844,THE BREASTPLATE,late poets they keep in touch with the armament of their time if they
4845,THE BREASTPLATE,speak of huge shields only because they are conservative archaeologists
4846,THE BREASTPLATE,then on the other hand they speak of corslets and greaves because they
4849,THE BREASTPLATE,they cannot be both at once they are depicting a single age a single
4850,THE BREASTPLATE,moment in culture that age is certainly sundered from the mycenaean
4851,THE BREASTPLATE,prime by the century or two in which changing ideas led to the
4852,THE BREASTPLATE,superseding of burial by burning or it is sundered from the mycenaean
4853,THE BREASTPLATE,prime by a foreign conquest a revolution and the years in which the
4856,THE BREASTPLATE,in either alternative and one or other must be actual there was time
4857,THE BREASTPLATE,enough for many changes in the culture of the mycenaean prime to be
4858,THE BREASTPLATE,evolved these changes we say are represented by the descriptions of
4859,THE BREASTPLATE,culture in the iliad that hypothesis explains simply and readily all
4860,THE BREASTPLATE,the facts the other hypothesis that the _iliad_ was begun near the
4861,THE BREASTPLATE,mycenaean prime and was continued throughout four or five centuries
4862,THE BREASTPLATE,cannot first explain how the _iliad_ was _composed_ and next
4863,THE BREASTPLATE,it wanders among apparent contradictories and through a maze of
4870,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",we are far from contending that it is always possible to
4871,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",understand homers descriptions of defensive armour but as we have
4872,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",never seen the actual objects perhaps the poets phrases were clear
4873,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",enough to his audience and are only difficult to us i do not for

4877,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",alighted upon the firm _zoster_ through the wrought _zoster_ it sped
4878,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",and through the curiously wrought breastplate it pressed on and through
4879,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",the _mitre_ he wore to shield his flesh a barrier against darts and

4913,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",seen that the huge shields as of aias were survivals in poetry
4914,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",that homer saw small round bucklers in use and supposed that the old

4942,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",if they had skill enough to make a metallic _mitrê_ they could not have
4943,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",been so unskilled as to be unable to make corslets of some more or
4944,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",less serviceable type probably they began with huge shields added the
4945,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",_linothorex_ like the iroquois cotton _thorex_ and next as a rule
4946,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",superseded that with the bronze _thorex_ while retaining the huge
4947,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",shield because the bronze _thorex_ was so inadequate to its purpose of

4949,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",to the shock with heavy spears and as the bronze _thorex_ really could
4950,"THE ZOSTER, ZOMA, AND MITRE",sometimes keep out an arrow they reduced the size of their shields and

5047,BRONZE AND IRON,of weapons and armour with cups ornaments c iron is employed
5048,BRONZE AND IRON,and bronze is also used in the making of tools and implements such

5051,BRONZE AND IRON,pastoral life meanwhile iron is a substance perfectly familiar to the
5052,BRONZE AND IRON,poets it is far indeed from being a priceless rarity it is impossible
5053,BRONZE AND IRON,to trace homeric stages of advance in knowledge of iron and it yields
5055,BRONZE AND IRON,epithets are more frequent in the odyssey and the later books of the
5056,BRONZE AND IRON,iliad than in the earlier books of the iliad but as articles made

5058,BRONZE AND IRON,spoken of ten timesaxes and adzes as a classand iron bonds where
5059,BRONZE AND IRON,iron probably means strong not to be broken footnote in these
5060,BRONZE AND IRON,circumstances it is curious that mr monro should have written thus

5065,BRONZE AND IRON,of the composition of the odyssey the use of iron was becoming more
5066,BRONZE AND IRON,common or that the use of bronze was becoming more rare than when the
5067,BRONZE AND IRON,_iliad_ was put together bronze is in the poems the military metal
5068,BRONZE AND IRON,the _iliad_ is a military poem while the _odyssey_ is an epic of peace
5069,BRONZE AND IRON,consequently the _iliad_ is much more copious in references to bronze
5070,BRONZE AND IRON,than the _odyssey_ has any occasion to be wives are far more frequently
5071,BRONZE AND IRON,mentioned in the odyssey than in the _iliad_ but nobody will argue that
5072,BRONZE AND IRON,therefore marriage had recently come more into vogue again the method
5073,BRONZE AND IRON,of counting up references to iron in the odyssey is quite misleading
5074,BRONZE AND IRON,when we remember that ten out of the twenty references are only _one_
5075,BRONZE AND IRON,reference to one and the same set of iron toolsaxes mr monro also
5076,BRONZE AND IRON,proposed to leave six references to iron in the _iliad_ out of the
5077,BRONZE AND IRON,reckoning as all of them are in lines which can be omitted without
5078,BRONZE AND IRON,detriment to the sense most of the six are in a recurrent epic formula

5080,BRONZE AND IRON,gold and women the existence of the formula proves familiarity with

5082,BRONZE AND IRON,arbitrarymonro odyssey vol ii p 339 the statement of facts
5083,BRONZE AND IRON,given here is much akin to helbigs account of the uses of bronze and

5086,BRONZE AND IRON,more frequent mention of iron _implements_ than of iron _weapons of
5087,BRONZE AND IRON,war_ he then gives examples which we produce later and especially
5088,BRONZE AND IRON,remarks on what achilles says when he offers a mass of iron as a prize

5096,BRONZE AND IRON,the facts being as we and helbig agree in stating them we suppose that
5097,BRONZE AND IRON,the homeric poets sing of the usages of their own time it is an age
5098,BRONZE AND IRON,when iron though quite familiar is not yet employed for armour or
5099,BRONZE AND IRON,for swords or spears which must be of excellent temper without great
5100,BRONZE AND IRON,weight in proportion to their length and size iron is only employed in

5136,BRONZE AND IRON,mentions its use for defensive armour or for swords and spears
5138,BRONZE AND IRON,only in two cases does homer describe any weapon as of iron there is to

5149,BRONZE AND IRON,the odyssey speaks of _great axes_ habitually made of iron footnote

5162,BRONZE AND IRON,mr leaf gets rid of this solitary iron _casse tête_ in a
5163,BRONZE AND IRON,pleasant way since he wrote his _companion to the iliad_ 1902 he has
5164,BRONZE AND IRON,become converted as we saw to the theory demolished by mr monro
5165,BRONZE AND IRON,nutzhorn and grote and denounced by blass that the origin of our
5166,BRONZE AND IRON,homer is a text edited by some literary retainer of pisistratus of
5167,BRONZE AND IRON,athens about 560540 bc the editor arranged current lays altered
5168,BRONZE AND IRON,freely and wrote in as much as he pleased probably he wrote this
5169,BRONZE AND IRON,passage in which nestor describes the man of the iron mace for the
5170,BRONZE AND IRON,tales of nestors youthful exploits all of which bear the mark of late
5171,BRONZE AND IRON,work are introduced with no special applicability to the context but
5172,BRONZE AND IRON,rather with the intention of glorifying the ancestor of pisistratus
5173,BRONZE AND IRON,footnote iliad 1900 vii 149 note if pisistratus was pleased
5174,BRONZE AND IRON,with the ancestral portrait nobody has a right to interfere but we
5177,BRONZE AND IRON,iron axes are offered as prizes by achilles footnote iliad
5178,BRONZE AND IRON,xxiii 850 and we have the iron axes of odysseus who shot an arrow
5179,BRONZE AND IRON,through the apertures in the blades at the close of the odyssey
5180,BRONZE AND IRON,but all these axes as we shall show were not weapons but _peaceful
5183,BRONZE AND IRON,as a matter of certain fact the swords and spears of homers
5184,BRONZE AND IRON,warriors are invariably said by the poet to be of bronze not of iron

5187,BRONZE AND IRON,except for an arrowhead to which we shall return and the one iron
5188,BRONZE AND IRON,mace noted as an eccentricity no weapon in homer is ever said to be of

5197,BRONZE AND IRON,odyssey footnote _iliad_ iii 334335 bronze is the sword which he
5198,BRONZE AND IRON,brought from troy and bronze is the sword presented to him by euryalus
5199,BRONZE AND IRON,in phaeacia and bronze is the spear with which he fought under the
5200,BRONZE AND IRON,walls of ilios footnote _odyssey_ x 162 261262 there are other
5201,BRONZE AND IRON,examples of bronze swords while spears are invariably said to be of
5204,BRONZE AND IRON,here we are on the ground of solid certainty we see that the homeric
5205,BRONZE AND IRON,warrior has regularly spear and sword of bronze if any man used a spear
5206,BRONZE AND IRON,or sword of iron homer never once mentions the fact if the poets
5207,BRONZE AND IRON,in an age of iron weapons always spoke of bronze out of deference to
5210,BRONZE AND IRON,thus as regards weapons the homeric heroes are in the age of bronze
5211,BRONZE AND IRON,like them who slept in the tombs of the mycenaean age when homer speaks
5212,BRONZE AND IRON,of the use of cutting instruments of iron he is always concerned
5213,BRONZE AND IRON,except in the two cases given not with blank space but with
5214,BRONZE AND IRON,_implements_ which really were of iron the wheelwright fells a tree

5221,BRONZE AND IRON,blade see the design of a bronze example from vaphio in tsountas and
5222,BRONZE AND IRON,manatt _the mycenaean age_ p 207 fig 94 thus homer never says
5223,BRONZE AND IRON,that this or that was done with the iron in the case of any but one
5224,BRONZE AND IRON,weapon of war pandarus drew the bowstring to his breast and to the
5225,BRONZE AND IRON,bow footnote iliad w 123 whoever wrote that line was writing
5226,BRONZE AND IRON,in an age we may think when arrowheads were commonly of iron but in
5227,BRONZE AND IRON,homer when the metal of the arrowhead is mentioned except in this
5228,BRONZE AND IRON,one case it is always bronze the iron arrowtip of pandarus was of an
5229,BRONZE AND IRON,early type the shaft did not run into the socket of the arrowhead the
5230,BRONZE AND IRON,tang of the arrowhead on the other hand entered the shaft and was
5231,BRONZE AND IRON,whipped on with sinew _iliad_ iv 151 pretty primitive this method
5232,BRONZE AND IRON,still the iron is an advance on the uniform bronze of homer the line
5233,BRONZE AND IRON,about pandarus and the iron arrowhead may really be early enough for
5235,BRONZE AND IRON,the attitude of the archer he drew the arrow to his breast on the
5236,BRONZE AND IRON,mycenaean silver bowl representing a siege the archers draw to the
5237,BRONZE AND IRON,breast in the primitive style as does the archer on the bronze dagger

5241,BRONZE AND IRON,journal of the anthropological institute vol xxx p 210 in
5242,BRONZE AND IRON,these circumstances we cannot deny that the poet may have known iron
5245,BRONZE AND IRON,we now take the case of axes we never hear from homer of the use of
5246,BRONZE AND IRON,an iron axe in battle and warlike use of an axe only occurs twice in

5287,BRONZE AND IRON,material of the axe or adze again we saw when achilles gives a mass of

5294,BRONZE AND IRON,xxiii 835 note the idea of a state of things when the ploughman and
5295,BRONZE AND IRON,shepherd forge their own tools from a lump of raw iron has a suspicious
5296,BRONZE AND IRON,appearance of a deliberate attempt to represent from the inner
5297,BRONZE AND IRON,consciousness an archaic state of civilisation in homeric times the
5298,BRONZE AND IRON,greek chalceus is already specialised as a worker in metals
5299,BRONZE AND IRON,however homer does not say that the ploughman and shepherd forge their
5300,BRONZE AND IRON,own tools a homeric chief far from a town would have his own smithy

5307,BRONZE AND IRON,a prehistoric state of civilisation is out of the question even
5311,BRONZE AND IRON,this was the regular state of things in the highlands during the
5312,BRONZE AND IRON,eighteenth century when many chiefs and most of the clans lived far
5313,BRONZE AND IRON,from any town but these rural smiths did not make swordblades which

5325,BRONZE AND IRON,the homeric poems whether composed in one age or throughout five

5350,BRONZE AND IRON,the other hand deliberately attempted to reproduce from their inner
5352,BRONZE AND IRON,they lived in an age of iron weapons they knew as hesiod knew that

5405,BRONZE AND IRON,at hallstatt there was the _normal_ evolution from bronze swords and

5407,BRONZE AND IRON,made this step seeing that they were familiar with the use of iron why
5408,BRONZE AND IRON,do they use bronze for swords and spears iron for tools the obvious
5409,BRONZE AND IRON,answer is that they could temper bronze for military purposes much
5410,BRONZE AND IRON,better than they could temper iron now mr ridgeway quotes polybius
5411,BRONZE AND IRON,ii 30 ii 33 for the truly execrable quality of the iron of the
5412,BRONZE AND IRON,celtic invaders of italy as late as 225 bc their swords were as bad
5413,BRONZE AND IRON,as or worse than british bayonets they _always_ doubled up their
5414,BRONZE AND IRON,long iron swords were easily bent and could only give one downward
5415,BRONZE AND IRON,stroke with any effect but after this the edges got so turned and the
5416,BRONZE AND IRON,blades so bent that unless they had time to straighten them with
5417,BRONZE AND IRON,the foot against the ground they could not deliver a second blow
5418,BRONZE AND IRON,footnote _early age of greece_ vol i 408 if the heroes in homers
5419,BRONZE AND IRON,time possessed iron as badly tempered as that of the celts of 225 bc
5420,BRONZE AND IRON,they had every reason to prefer as they did excellent bronze for all
5421,BRONZE AND IRON,their military weapons while reserving iron for pacific purposes a
5422,BRONZE AND IRON,woodcutters axe might have any amount of weight and thickness of iron
5423,BRONZE AND IRON,behind the edge not so a sword blade or a spear point footnote
5424,BRONZE AND IRON,monsieur salomon reinach suggests to me that the story of polybius may
5425,BRONZE AND IRON,be a myth swords and spearheads in graves are often found doubled up
5426,BRONZE AND IRON,possibly they are thus made dead like the owner and their spirits are
5427,BRONZE AND IRON,thus set free to be of use to his spirit finding doubled up iron swords
5428,BRONZE AND IRON,in celtic graves the romans m beinach suggests may have explained
5429,BRONZE AND IRON,their useless condition by the theory that they doubled up in battle
5430,BRONZE AND IRON,leaving their owners easy victims and this myth was accepted as fact
5431,BRONZE AND IRON,by polybius but he was not addicted to myth nor very remote from the
5432,BRONZE AND IRON,events which he chronicles again though bronze graveweapons in our
5433,BRONZE AND IRON,museum are often doubled up the myth is not told of the warriors of the
5434,BRONZE AND IRON,age of bronze we later give examples of the doubling up in battle of
5437,BRONZE AND IRON,in the _iliad_ we hear of swords breaking at the hilt in dealing a
5438,BRONZE AND IRON,stroke at shield or helmet a thing most incident to bronze swords
5439,BRONZE AND IRON,especially of the early type with a thin bronze tang inserted in a
5440,BRONZE AND IRON,hilt of wood ivory or amber or with a slight shelf of the bronze hilt

5449,BRONZE AND IRON,every stroke like a piece of hoop iron but mr leaf tells us that by
5450,BRONZE AND IRON,primitive modes of smelting iron is made hard and brittle like cast

5462,BRONZE AND IRON,could be used for a swashing blow and there are just half as many
5463,BRONZE AND IRON,thrusts as strokes with the bronze sword in the _iliad_ footnote
5464,BRONZE AND IRON,twentyfour cuts to eleven lunges in the _iliad_ as the poet
5465,BRONZE AND IRON,constantly dwells on the long edge of the _bronze_ swords and makes
5466,BRONZE AND IRON,heroes use both point and edge how can we argue that homeric swords
5467,BRONZE AND IRON,were of iron and ill fitted to give point the highlanders at clifton
5468,BRONZE AND IRON,1746 were obliged contrary to their common practice to use the point

5473,BRONZE AND IRON,that of the celts a thousand years later their preference for bronze
5474,BRONZE AND IRON,over iron for weapons is explained in homer the fighters do not very
5475,BRONZE AND IRON,often come to sword strokes they fight mainly with the spear except
5476,BRONZE AND IRON,in pursuit now and then but when they do strike they cleave heads and

5483,BRONZE AND IRON,face by ornamental grip plates riveted on this sword though still of
5484,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze can deal a very effective cut and as the mycenaeans had no

5500,BRONZE AND IRON,that of the celts of polybius a thousand years later their preference
5501,BRONZE AND IRON,of bronze over iron for weapons needs no explanation if their iron
5502,BRONZE AND IRON,was not so bad as that of the celts their military conservatism might
5503,BRONZE AND IRON,retain bronze for weapons while in civil life they often used iron for
5506,BRONZE AND IRON,the uniform evidence of the homeric poems can only be explained on the
5507,BRONZE AND IRON,supposition that men had plenty of iron but while they used it for
5508,BRONZE AND IRON,implements did not yet with a natural conservatism trust life and
5509,BRONZE AND IRON,victory to iron spears and swords unluckily we cannot test the
5510,BRONZE AND IRON,temper of the earliest known iron swords found in greece for rust hath
5511,BRONZE AND IRON,consumed them and i know not that the temper of the mycenaean bronze

5521,BRONZE AND IRON,_for iron of himself draweth a man to him_ the proverb is manifestly
5522,BRONZE AND IRON,of an age when iron was almost universally used for weapons and thus
5523,BRONZE AND IRON,was as in thucydides synonymous with all warlike gear but throughout
5524,BRONZE AND IRON,the poems no single article of warlike gear is of iron except one
5525,BRONZE AND IRON,eccentric mace and one arrowhead of primitive type the line in the
5526,BRONZE AND IRON,odyssey must therefore be a very late addition it may be removed
5527,BRONZE AND IRON,without injuring the sense of the passage in which it occurs footnote
5528,BRONZE AND IRON,this fact in itself is of course no proof of interpolation _cf_
5529,BRONZE AND IRON,helbig _op_ cit p 331 he thinks the line very late if on the
5530,BRONZE AND IRON,other hand the line be as old as the oldest parts of the poem the
5533,BRONZE AND IRON,we are thus led to the conclusion that either there was in early greece
5534,BRONZE AND IRON,an age when weapons were all of bronze while implements were often
5535,BRONZE AND IRON,of iron or that the poet or crowd of poets invented that state of
5536,BRONZE AND IRON,things now early poets never invent in this way singing to an audience
5537,BRONZE AND IRON,of warriors critical on such a point they speak of what the warriors
5538,BRONZE AND IRON,know to be actual except when in a recognised form of decorative
5544,BRONZE AND IRON,our theory is then that in the age when the homeric poems were
5545,BRONZE AND IRON,composed iron though well known was on its probation men of the
5546,BRONZE AND IRON,sword preferred bronze for all their military purposes just as
5548,BRONZE AND IRON,effective than guns or as the duke of wellington forbade the arming of
5549,BRONZE AND IRON,all our men with rifles in place of muskets  for reasons not devoid
5552,BRONZE AND IRON,sir john evans supposes that in the seventh century the carian and

5554,BRONZE AND IRON,of iron footnote ancient _bronze implements_ p 8 1881 citing

5556,BRONZE AND IRON,were not of copper for they twice double up against a shield _iliad_
5557,BRONZE AND IRON,iii 348 vii 259 evans p 13 sir john remarks that for a
5558,BRONZE AND IRON,considerable time after the homeric period bronze remained in use for
5560,BRONZE AND IRON,hesiod quite unlike his contemporaries the later poets of iliad
5561,BRONZE AND IRON,and _odyssey_ gives to heracles an iron helmet and sword footnote
5562,BRONZE AND IRON,_scutum herculis_ pp 122138 hesiod knew better but was not a
5563,BRONZE AND IRON,consistent archaiser sir john thinks that as early as 500 or even 600
5564,BRONZE AND IRON,bc iron and steel were in common use for weapons in greece but
5565,BRONZE AND IRON,not yet had they altogether superseded bronze battleaxes and spears
5566,BRONZE AND IRON,footnote evans p 18 by sir johns showing iron for offensive
5567,BRONZE AND IRON,weapons superseded bronze very slowly indeed in greece and if my
5568,BRONZE AND IRON,argument be correct it had not done so when the homeric poems were
5569,BRONZE AND IRON,composed iron merely served for utensils and the poems reflect that
5570,BRONZE AND IRON,stage of transition which no poet could dream of inventing
5572,BRONZE AND IRON,these pages had been written before my attention was directed to m
5573,BRONZE AND IRON,bérards book _les pheniciens et lodyssée_ paris 1902 m bérard
5574,BRONZE AND IRON,has anticipated and rather outrun my ideas i might almost say he
5575,BRONZE AND IRON,remarks that iron is the popular metal native and rustic the
5576,BRONZE AND IRON,shepherd and ploughman can extract and work it without going to the
5577,BRONZE AND IRON,town the chiefs smith could work iron if he had iron to work and
5578,BRONZE AND IRON,this iron achilles gave as a prize with rustic methods of working it
5579,BRONZE AND IRON,iron is always impure it has straws in it and is brittle it may be
5580,BRONZE AND IRON,the metal for peace and for implements in our fields we see the reaper
5581,BRONZE AND IRON,sit down and repair his sickle in war is needed a metal less hard
5582,BRONZE AND IRON,perhaps but more tough and not so easily broken you cannot sit down
5583,BRONZE AND IRON,in the field of battle as in a field of barley to beat your sword
5588,BRONZE AND IRON,on the other hand iron swords did supersede bronze swords in the long
5589,BRONZE AND IRON,run apparently they had not done so in the age of the poet but iron
5590,BRONZE AND IRON,had certainly ceased to be a precious metal knives and woodcutters
5591,BRONZE AND IRON,axes are never made of a metal that is precious and rare i am thus led
5592,BRONZE AND IRON,on a general view to suppose that the poems took shape when iron was
5593,BRONZE AND IRON,very well known but was not yet as in the dipylon period in crete
5596,BRONZE AND IRON,the ideas here stated are not unlike those of paul cauer footnote
5597,BRONZE AND IRON,_grundfrager des homerkritik_ pp 183187 leipsic 1895 i do not
5598,BRONZE AND IRON,however find the mentions of iron useful as a test of early and
5599,BRONZE AND IRON,late lays which it is his theory that they are thus he says
5601,BRONZE AND IRON,1 iron is often mentioned as part of a mans personal property while
5602,BRONZE AND IRON,we are not told how he means to use it it is named with bronze gold
5603,BRONZE AND IRON,and girls the poet has no definite picture before his eyes he is vague
5604,BRONZE AND IRON,about iron but we reply his picture of iron in these passages is
5605,BRONZE AND IRON,neither more nor less definite than his mental picture of the other
5606,BRONZE AND IRON,commodities he calls iron hard to smithy grey darkhued he
5607,BRONZE AND IRON,knows in fact all about it he does not tell us what the owner is
5608,BRONZE AND IRON,going to do with the gold and the bronze and the girls any more than he
5609,BRONZE AND IRON,tells us what is to be done with the iron such information was rather
5610,BRONZE AND IRON,in the nature of a luxury than a necessity every hearer knew the uses
5611,BRONZE AND IRON,of all four commodities this does not seem to have occurred to cauer
5613,BRONZE AND IRON,2 iron is spoken of as an emblem of hard things as to take a modern
5614,BRONZE AND IRON,example in mr swinburnes armed and iron maidenhood said of
5615,BRONZE AND IRON,atalanta hearts are iron strength is iron flesh is not iron an
5616,BRONZE AND IRON,iron noise goes up to the heaven of bronze it may not follow cauer
5617,BRONZE AND IRON,thinks from these phrases that iron was used in any way men are
5618,BRONZE AND IRON,supposed to marvel at its strange properties it was new and rare i
5621,BRONZE AND IRON,3 we have the iron gates of tartarus and the iron bonds in which
5622,BRONZE AND IRON,odysseus was possibly lying it does not follow that chains or gates
5623,BRONZE AND IRON,were made of iron any more than that gates were of chrysoprase in the
5626,BRONZE AND IRON,4 next we have mention of implements not weapons of irona
5627,BRONZE AND IRON,remarkable trait of culture greek ploughs and axes were made of iron
5630,BRONZE AND IRON,5 we have mention of iron weapons namely the unique iron mace of
5631,BRONZE AND IRON,areithous and the solitary iron arrowhead of pandarus and what cauer
5632,BRONZE AND IRON,calls the iron swords more probably knives of achilles and others it
5633,BRONZE AND IRON,is objected to the iron of achilles that antilochus fears he will cut
5634,BRONZE AND IRON,his throat with it on hearing of the death of patroclus while there
5635,BRONZE AND IRON,is no other mention of suicide in the _iliad_ it does not follow that
5636,BRONZE AND IRON,suicide was unheard of indeed achilles may be thinking of suicide
5637,BRONZE AND IRON,presently in xiii 98 when he says to his mother let me die at once
5638,BRONZE AND IRON,since it was not my lot to succour my comrade
5640,BRONZE AND IRON,6 we have the ironmaking spoken of in book ix 393 of the _odyssey_
5642,BRONZE AND IRON,it does not appear to us that the use of iron as an epithet bespeaks
5643,BRONZE AND IRON,an age when iron was a mysterious thing known mainly by reputation
5644,BRONZE AND IRON,a costly possession the epithets iron strength and so on may as
5645,BRONZE AND IRON,readily be used in our own age or any other if iron were at first a
5646,BRONZE AND IRON,precious metal it is odd that homeric men first used it as cauer
5647,BRONZE AND IRON,sees that they did to make points to ploughshares and tools of
5648,BRONZE AND IRON,agriculture and handiwork then people took to working iron for
5649,BRONZE AND IRON,weapons just so but we cannot divide the _iliad_ into earlier and
5650,BRONZE AND IRON,later portions in proportion to the various mentions of iron in various
5651,BRONZE AND IRON,books these statistics are of no value for separatist purposes it is
5652,BRONZE AND IRON,impossible to believe that men when they spoke of iron strength iron
5653,BRONZE AND IRON,hearts grey iron iron hard to smithy did so because iron was
5654,BRONZE AND IRON,first an almost unknown legendary mineral next a precious metal
5655,BRONZE AND IRON,then the metal of drudgery and finally the metal of weapons
5657,BRONZE AND IRON,the real point of interest is as cauer sees that domestic preceded
5658,BRONZE AND IRON,military uses of iron among the achaeans he seems however to think
5659,BRONZE AND IRON,that the confinement of the use of bronze to weapons is a matter of
5660,BRONZE AND IRON,traditional style footnote nur die sprache der dichter hielt an dem
5661,BRONZE AND IRON,gebrauch der bronze fest die in den jahrhunderten während deren der
5662,BRONZE AND IRON,epische stil erwachsen war allein geherrscht hatte but in the early
5663,BRONZE AND IRON,days of the waxing epics tools as well as weapons were as in homer
5664,BRONZE AND IRON,they occasionally are of bronze why then do the supposed late
5665,BRONZE AND IRON,continuators represent tools not weapons as of iron why do they not
5666,BRONZE AND IRON,cleave to the traditional termbronzein the case of tools as the
5669,BRONZE AND IRON,helbig offers an apparently untenable explanation of this fact he has
5670,BRONZE AND IRON,proposed an interpretation of the uses of bronze and iron in the poems
5671,BRONZE AND IRON,entirely different from that which i offer footnote _sur la question
5673,BRONZE AND IRON,without entering again into the whole question of the construction
5674,BRONZE AND IRON,of the epics he thinks that the origin of the poems dates from the
5675,BRONZE AND IRON,mycenaean period and that the later continuators of the poems retained
5676,BRONZE AND IRON,the traditions of that remote age thus they thrice call mycenae
5677,BRONZE AND IRON,golden though in the changed economic conditions of their own
5678,BRONZE AND IRON,period mycenae could no longer be golden and i presume that if
5679,BRONZE AND IRON,possible the city would have issued a papyrus currency without a
5680,BRONZE AND IRON,metallic basis however this may be in the description of customs
5681,BRONZE AND IRON,the epic poets did their best to avoid everything modern here we
5685,BRONZE AND IRON,we have first to suppose that the kernel of the _iliad_ originated in
5686,BRONZE AND IRON,the mycenaean age the age of bronze we are next to believe that this
5687,BRONZE AND IRON,kernel was expanded into the actual epic in later and changed times
5688,BRONZE AND IRON,but that the later poets adhered in their descriptions to the mycenaean
5690,BRONZE AND IRON,period when treating of the themes of ancient legend or song carefully
5691,BRONZE AND IRON,avoid everything modern is an opinion not warranted by the usage of
5692,BRONZE AND IRON,the authors of the _chansons de geste_ of _beowulf_ and of the
5694,BRONZE AND IRON,in their chants concerning ancient days the customs costume armour
5695,BRONZE AND IRON,religion and weapons of their own time dr helbig supposes that the
5696,BRONZE AND IRON,late greek poets however who added to the _iliad_ carefully avoided
5697,BRONZE AND IRON,doing what other poets of uncritical ages have always done footnote
5700,BRONZE AND IRON,this is his position in his text p 50 in his note 1 to page 50
5701,BRONZE AND IRON,however he occupies the precisely contrary position the epic poems
5702,BRONZE AND IRON,were chanted as a rule in the houses of more or less warlike chiefs
5703,BRONZE AND IRON,it is then _à priori_ probable that the later poets took into account
5704,BRONZE AND IRON,the _contemporary_ military state of things their audience would have
5705,BRONZE AND IRON,been much perturbed _bien chequés_ if they had heard the poet mention
5706,BRONZE AND IRON,nothing but arms and forms of attack and defence to which they were
5707,BRONZE AND IRON,unaccustomed if so when iron weapons came in the poets would
5708,BRONZE AND IRON,substitute iron for bronze in lays new and old but they never do
5709,BRONZE AND IRON,however this is helbigs opinion in his note but in his text he says
5710,BRONZE AND IRON,that the poets carefully avoiding the contemporary the modern make
5711,BRONZE AND IRON,the heroes fight not on horseback but from chariots their listeners
5712,BRONZE AND IRON,according to his note must have been _bien chequés_ for there came a
5715,BRONZE AND IRON,thus the poets who in dr helbigs text avoid as far as possible all
5716,BRONZE AND IRON,that is modern in his note on the same page take account of the
5717,BRONZE AND IRON,contemporary state of things and are as modern as possible where
5718,BRONZE AND IRON,weapons _are_ concerned their audience would be sadly put out _bien
5719,BRONZE AND IRON,chequés_ if they heard talk only of arms  to which they were
5721,BRONZE AND IRON,and of bronze weapons they had to endure it whether they liked it or
5722,BRONZE AND IRON,not _teste_ reichel dr helbig seems to speak correctly in his note
5723,BRONZE AND IRON,in his text his contradictory opinion appears to be wrong experience
5724,BRONZE AND IRON,teaches us that the poets of an uncritical ageshakespeare for
5725,BRONZE AND IRON,exampleintroduce the weapons of their own period into works dealing
5728,BRONZE AND IRON,in his argument on bronze and iron unluckily dr helbig deserts the
5729,BRONZE AND IRON,judicious opinions of his note for the opposite theory of his text
5730,BRONZE AND IRON,his late poets in the age of iron always say that the weapons of the
5731,BRONZE AND IRON,heroes are made of bronze footnote _op laud_ p 51 they thus
5732,BRONZE AND IRON,as far as possible avoid what is modern but of course warriors
5733,BRONZE AND IRON,of the age of iron when they heard the poet talk only of weapons of
5734,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze _aurient été bien choqués_ as dr helbig truly says in his
5735,BRONZE AND IRON,note on hearing of nothing but _armes auxquels ils nétaient pas
5738,BRONZE AND IRON,though dr helbig in his text is of the opposite opinion i must agree
5739,BRONZE AND IRON,entirely with the view which he states so clearly in his note it
5740,BRONZE AND IRON,follows that if a poet speaks invariably of weapons of bronze he is
5741,BRONZE AND IRON,living in an age when weapons are made of no other material in his
5742,BRONZE AND IRON,text however dr helbig maintains that the poets of later ages as far
5743,BRONZE AND IRON,as possible avoid everything modern and therefore mention none but
5744,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze weapons but as he has pointed out they do mention iron tools
5745,BRONZE AND IRON,and implements why do they desert the traditional bronze because it
5746,BRONZE AND IRON,occasionally happened that a poet when thinking of an entirely new
5750,BRONZE AND IRON,the examples given in proof are the offer by achilles of a lump of iron
5751,BRONZE AND IRON,as the prize for archerythe iron as we saw being destined for the
5752,BRONZE AND IRON,manufacture of pastoral and agricultural implements in which dr helbig
5753,BRONZE AND IRON,includes the lances of shepherds and ploughmen though the poet never
5754,BRONZE AND IRON,says that they were of iron footnote _iliad_ xxiii 826 835
5755,BRONZE AND IRON,odyssey xiv 531 xiii 225 there are also the axes through which
5756,BRONZE AND IRON,odysseus shoots his arrow footnote _odyssey_ xix 587 xxi 3 x
5757,BRONZE AND IRON,97 114 127 138 xxiv 168 177 cf xxi 61 the poet here treated
5758,BRONZE AND IRON,an entirely new subject in the development of which he had perfect
5759,BRONZE AND IRON,liberty so he speaks freely of iron but we exclaim tools and
5760,BRONZE AND IRON,implements axes and knives are not a perfectly new subject they were
5761,BRONZE AND IRON,extremely familiar to the age of bronze the mycenaean age examples of
5763,BRONZE AND IRON,on mycenaean sites there was nothing new about bronze tools and
5764,BRONZE AND IRON,implements men had bronze tips to their ploughshares bronze knives
5767,BRONZE AND IRON,perhaps we are to understand that feats of archery nonmilitary
5768,BRONZE AND IRON,contests in bowmanship are _un sujet à fait nouveau_ a theme so very
5769,BRONZE AND IRON,modern that a poet in singing of it could let himself go and dare to
5770,BRONZE AND IRON,speak of iron implements but where was the novelty all peoples who use
5771,BRONZE AND IRON,the bow in war practise archery in time of peace the poet moreover
5772,BRONZE AND IRON,speaks of bronze tools axes and knives in other parts of the _iliad_
5773,BRONZE AND IRON,neither tools nor bronze tools constitute _un sujet tout à fait
5774,BRONZE AND IRON,nouveau_ there was nothing new in shooting with a bow and nothing new
5775,BRONZE AND IRON,in the existence of axes bows and axes were as familiar to the age
5776,BRONZE AND IRON,of stone and to the age of bronze as to the age of iron dr helbigs
5778,BRONZE AND IRON,explanation is offered we return to the theory rejected by dr helbig
5779,BRONZE AND IRON,that implements and tools were often not always of iron while weapons
5780,BRONZE AND IRON,were of bronze in the age of the poet dr helbig rejects this opinion
5781,BRONZE AND IRON,he writes we cannot in any way admit that at a period when the socks
5782,BRONZE AND IRON,of the plough the lance points of shepherds which the poet never
5783,BRONZE AND IRON,describes as of iron and axeheads were of iron warriors still used
5784,BRONZE AND IRON,weapons of bronze footnote op _laud_ p 53 but it is logically
5785,BRONZE AND IRON,possible to admit that this was the real state of affairs while it is
5786,BRONZE AND IRON,logically impossible to admit that bows and tools were new subjects
5787,BRONZE AND IRON,and that late poets when they sang of military gear _tenaient
5789,BRONZE AND IRON,bewildering their hearers by speaking of antiquated arms and at the
5790,BRONZE AND IRON,same time spoke of nothing but antiquated armsweapons of bronzeand
5791,BRONZE AND IRON,of war chariots to fighting men who did not use war chariots and did
5794,BRONZE AND IRON,these logical contradictions beset all arguments in which it is
5795,BRONZE AND IRON,maintained that the late poets are anxious archaisers and at the same
5796,BRONZE AND IRON,time are eagerly introducing the armour and equipment of their own age
5797,BRONZE AND IRON,the critics are in the same quandary as to iron and bronze as traps them
5798,BRONZE AND IRON,in the case of large shields small bucklers greaves and corslets
5799,BRONZE AND IRON,they are obliged to assign contradictory attitudes to their late
5800,BRONZE AND IRON,poets it does not seem possible to admit that a poet who often
5801,BRONZE AND IRON,describes axes as of iron in various passages does so in his account of
5802,BRONZE AND IRON,a peaceful contest in bowmanship because contests in bowmanship are _un
5803,BRONZE AND IRON,sujet tout à fait nouveau_ and so he feels at liberty to describe axes
5804,BRONZE AND IRON,as of iron while he adheres to bronze as the metal for weapons he or
5805,BRONZE AND IRON,one of the odyssean poets had already asserted odyssey ix 391 that
5808,BRONZE AND IRON,dr helbigs argument footnote _la question mycénienne_ p 54 does
5809,BRONZE AND IRON,not explain the facts the bow of eurytus and the uses to which odysseus
5810,BRONZE AND IRON,is to put it have been in the poets mind all through the conduct of his
5811,BRONZE AND IRON,plot and there is nothing to suggest that the exploit of bowmanship is

5827,BRONZE AND IRON,of bronze when the metal is specified i have not seen that they are

5829,BRONZE AND IRON,and knives already mentionedwhich are not spears or swords and are
5830,BRONZE AND IRON,sometimes of bronze he also quotes the line in the odyssey iron of
5831,BRONZE AND IRON,itself doth attract a man but if this line is genuine and original
5832,BRONZE AND IRON,it does not apply to the state of things in the _iliad_ while it
5833,BRONZE AND IRON,contradicts the whole odyssey in which swords and spears are _always_
5834,BRONZE AND IRON,of bronze when their metal is mentioned if the line reveals the true
5835,BRONZE AND IRON,state of things then throughout the odyssey if not throughout the
5836,BRONZE AND IRON,_iliad_ the poets when they invariably speak of bronze swords and
5837,BRONZE AND IRON,spears invariably say what they do not mean if they do this how are
5838,BRONZE AND IRON,we to know when they mean what they say and of what value can their

5853,BRONZE AND IRON,the phaeacian presented to odysseus a bronze sword though as we have
5854,BRONZE AND IRON,seen mr ridgeway has seen the usual material for all such weapons
5855,BRONZE AND IRON,is iron but the phoeacians both belonged to the older race and lived in
5856,BRONZE AND IRON,a remote island and therefore swords of bronze may well have continued
5857,BRONZE AND IRON,in use in such outoftheworld places long after iron swords were in
5858,BRONZE AND IRON,use everywhere else in greece the man who could not afford iron had to
5859,BRONZE AND IRON,be satisfied with bronze footnote _early age of greece_ p 305
5860,BRONZE AND IRON,here the poet is allowed to mean what he says the phaeacian sword is
5861,BRONZE AND IRON,really of bronze with silver studs probably on the hilt odyssey
5863,BRONZE AND IRON,could afford ivory not iron but when the same poet tells us that
5864,BRONZE AND IRON,the sword which odysseus brought from troy was a great silverstudded
5865,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze sword odyssey x 261 262 then mr ridgeway does not allow
5866,BRONZE AND IRON,the poet to mean what he says the poet is now using an epic formula
5869,BRONZE AND IRON,that mr ridgeway adopts helbigs theorythe poet says bronze by a
5870,BRONZE AND IRON,survival of the diction of the bronze age when he means ironi infer
5871,BRONZE AND IRON,from the following passage _chalkos_ is the name for the older metal
5872,BRONZE AND IRON,of which cutting weapons were made and it thus lingered in many phrases
5873,BRONZE AND IRON,of the epic dialect to smite with the _chalkos_ was equivalent to our
5874,BRONZE AND IRON,phrase to smite with the steel footnote _early age of greece_ i
5875,BRONZE AND IRON,295 but we certainly do smite with the steel while the question is
5876,BRONZE AND IRON,_did_ homers men smite with the iron homer says not he does not
5877,BRONZE AND IRON,merely use an epic phrase to smite with the _chalkos_ but he
5879,BRONZE AND IRON,of bronze _chalkos_ while axes adzes and knives are frequently
5882,BRONZE AND IRON,mr ridgeway has an illustrative argument with some one who says the
5883,BRONZE AND IRON,dress and weapons of the saxons given in the lay of _beowulf_ fitted
5884,BRONZE AND IRON,exactly the bronze weapons in england for they had shields and spears
5885,BRONZE AND IRON,and battleaxes and swords if you pointed out to him that the saxon
5886,BRONZE AND IRON,poem spoke of these weapons as made of iron he would say i admit
5887,BRONZE AND IRON,that it is a difficulty but the resemblances are so many that the
5890,BRONZE AND IRON,now if the supposed controversialist were a homeric critic he would
5891,BRONZE AND IRON,not admit any difficulty he would say yes in _beowulf_ the
5892,BRONZE AND IRON,weapons are said to be of iron but that is the work of the christian
5894,BRONZE AND IRON,into the old heathen lay and who also not to puzzle his ironusing
5897,BRONZE AND IRON,we may prove anything if we argue now that the poets retain the
5898,BRONZE AND IRON,tradition of obsolete things now that they modernise as much as they
5899,BRONZE AND IRON,please into this method of reasoning after duly considering it i
5900,BRONZE AND IRON,am unable to come with enthusiasm being wedded to the belief that the
5901,BRONZE AND IRON,poets say what they mean were it otherwise did they not mean what
5902,BRONZE AND IRON,they say their evidence would be of no value they might be dealing
5903,BRONZE AND IRON,throughout in terms for things which were unrepresented in their own
5904,BRONZE AND IRON,age to prove this possible it would be necessary to adduce convincing
5905,BRONZE AND IRON,and sufficient examples of early national poets who habitually use
5906,BRONZE AND IRON,the terminology of an age long prior to their own in descriptions of
5907,BRONZE AND IRON,objects customs and usages meanwhile it is obvious that my whole
5908,BRONZE AND IRON,argument has no archaeological support we may find mycenaean corslets
5909,BRONZE AND IRON,and greaves but they are not in cremation burials no homeric cairn
5910,BRONZE AND IRON,with homeric contents has ever been discovered and if we did find
5911,BRONZE AND IRON,examples of homeric cairns it appears from the poems that they would
5914,BRONZE AND IRON,nowhere again do we find graves containing bronze swords and iron axes
5915,BRONZE AND IRON,and adzes i know nothing nearer in discoveries to my supposed age
5916,BRONZE AND IRON,of bronze weapons and iron tools than a grave of the early iron and
5917,BRONZE AND IRON,geometrical ornament age of cretea _tholos_ tomb with a bronze
5918,BRONZE AND IRON,spearhead and a set of iron tools among others a double axe and a
5919,BRONZE AND IRON,pick of iron but these were in company with iron swords to myself the
5920,BRONZE AND IRON,crowning mystery is what has become of the homeric tumuli with their
5921,BRONZE AND IRON,contents one can but say that only within the last thirty years have we
5922,BRONZE AND IRON,found or finding have recognised mycenaean burial records as to the
5923,BRONZE AND IRON,badness of the iron of the north for military purposes and the probable
5924,BRONZE AND IRON,badness of all early iron weapons we have testimony two thousand years
5925,BRONZE AND IRON,later than homer and some twelve hundred years later than polybius
5926,BRONZE AND IRON,in the eyrbyggja saga morris and maguússon chap xxiv we read that
5927,BRONZE AND IRON,steinthor was girt with a sword that was cunningly wrought the hilts
5928,BRONZE AND IRON,were white with silver and the grip wrapped round with the same but
5929,BRONZE AND IRON,the strings thereof were gilded this was a splendid sword described
5930,BRONZE AND IRON,with the homeric delight in such things but the battlecry arises and
5931,BRONZE AND IRON,then the fairwrought sword bit not when it smote armour and steinthor
5932,BRONZE AND IRON,must _straighten it under_ his _foot_ messrs morris and maguússon add
5933,BRONZE AND IRON,in a note this is a very common experience in scandinavian weapons
5934,BRONZE AND IRON,and for the first time heard of at the battle of aquae sextiae between
5935,BRONZE AND IRON,marius and the teutons footnote the reference is erroneous in the
5936,BRONZE AND IRON,north weaponsmiths who knew how to forge tempered or steellaminated
5937,BRONZE AND IRON,weapons were if not unknown at least very rare when such skill was
5938,BRONZE AND IRON,unknown or rare in homers time nothing was more natural than that
5939,BRONZE AND IRON,bronze should hold its own as the metal for swords and spears after
5950,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,if the homeric poems be as we maintain the work of a peculiar age the
5951,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,homeric house will also in all likelihood be peculiar it will not
5952,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,be the hellenic house of classical times manifestly the dwelling of a
5953,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,militaryprince in the heroic age would be evolved to meet his needs
5954,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,which were not the needs of later hellenic citizens in time of peace
5955,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the later greeks are weaponless men not surrounded by and entertaining
5956,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,throngs of armed retainers like the homeric chief the women of later
5957,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,greece moreover are in the background of life dwelling in the womens
5958,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,chambers behind those of the men in seclusion the homeric women also
5959,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,at least in the house of odysseus have their separate chambers which
5960,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the men seem not to enter except on invitation though the ladies freely

5968,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of the rich landowners of early iceland as described in the sagas there
5969,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,can be no doubt that the house of the icelandic chief was analogous to
5970,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the house of the homeric prince societies remarkably similar in mode
5972,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the icelanders owned no overlord and indeed left their native
5973,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,scandinavia to escape the sway of harold fairhair yet each wealthy and
5974,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,powerful chief lived in the manner of a homeric king his lands and
5975,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,thralls horses and cattle occupied his attention when he did not
5976,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,chance to be on viking adventurebearing bane to alien men he
5977,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,always carried sword and spear and often had occasion to use them
5978,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,he entertained many guests and needed a large hall and ample sleeping
5979,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,accommodation for strangers and servants his women were as free and as
5980,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,much respected as the ladies in homer and for a husband to slap a wife
5981,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,was to run the risk of her deadly feud thus far away in the frosts of
5982,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the north the life of the chief was like that of the homeric prince
5985,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,it is our intention to use this parallel in the discussion of the

5988,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and saga writers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries living
5990,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,introducing the arrangements of their own into the tale of past times
5991,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,but in any case one icelandic house of the tenth or eleventh century
5992,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,might differ from another in certain details it is not safe therefore
5993,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,to argue that difference of detail in homers accounts of various houses
5994,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,means that the varying descriptions were composed in different ages in
5995,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the _odyssey_ the plot demands that the poet must enter into domestic
5996,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,details much more freely than he ever has occasion to do in the iliad
5997,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,he may mention upper chambers freely for example it will not follow
5998,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,that in the _iliad_ upper chambers do not exist because they are only
6001,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,it is even more important to note that in the house of odysseus we have
6002,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,an unparalleled domestic situation the lady of the house is beset by
6003,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,more than a hundred wooerssorning on her in the old scots legal
6004,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,phrasemaking it impossible for her to inhabit her own hall and
6005,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,desirable to keep the women as much as possible apart from the men thus
6006,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the homeric house of which we know most that of odysseus is a house in
6009,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,for the sake of brevity we omit the old theory that the homeric
6010,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,house was practically that of historical greece with the mens hall
6011,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,approached by a door from the courtyard while a door at the upper end
6012,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of the mens hall yields direct access to the quarters where the women
6015,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,that opinion has not survived the essay by mr j l myres on the plan
6016,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of the homeric house footnote _journal of hellenic studies_ vol
6017,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,xx 128150 quite apart from arguments that rest on the ground plans
6018,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of palaces at mycenae and tiryns mr myres has proved by an exact
6019,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,reading of the poets words that the descriptions in the _odyssey_
6020,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,cannot be made intelligible on the theory that the poet has in his mind
6021,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,a house of the hellenic pattern but in his essay he hardly touches on
6022,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,any homeric house except that of odysseus in which the circumstances
6023,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,were unusual a later critic ferdinand noack has demonstrated that
6026,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,house is according to mr myres on the whole of the same plan as the
6027,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,hellenic house of historic days between these comes the mycenaean and
6028,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,homeric house so that the mycenaean house stands out _as an intrusive
6030,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,footnote myres _journal_ of _hellenic_ studies vol xx p 149
6031,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,noack goes further he draws a line between the mycenaean houses on one
6032,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,hand and the houses described by homer on the other while he thinks
6033,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,that the _late_ homeric house that of the closing books of the
6034,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,odyssey is widely sundered from the homeric house of the _iliad_
6035,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and from the houses of menelaus and alcinous in earlier books of the
6038,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in this case the iliadic and earlier odyssean houses are those of a
6039,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,single definite age neither mycenaean of the prime nor hellenica
6040,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,fact which entirely suits our argument but it is not so certain that
6041,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the house of odysseus is severed from the other homeric houses by the
6042,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,later addition of an upper storey as noack supposes and of womens
6043,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,quarters and of separate sleeping chambers for the heads of the family
6045,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the _iliad_ save in two passages and earlier books of the _odyssey_
6046,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,may not mention upper storeys because they have no occasion or only
6047,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,rare occasion to do so and some houses may have had upper sleeping
6048,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,chambers while others of the same period had not as we shall prove from
6051,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,mr myress idea of the homeric house or at least of the house of
6052,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,odysseus is that the women had a _meguron_ or common hall apart from
6053,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,that of the men with other chambers these did not lie to the direct
6054,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,rear of the mens hall nor were they entered by a door that opened in
6055,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the back wall of the mens hall penelope has a chamber in which
6056,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,she sleeps and does womans work upstairs her connubial chamber
6057,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,unoccupied during her lords absence is certainly on the ground floor
6058,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the womens rooms are severed from the mens hall by a courtyard in
6059,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the courtyard are chambers telemachus has his greek thalamos or
6060,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,chamber in the mens courtyard all this appears plain from the poets
6061,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,words and mr myres corroborates by the ground plans of the palaces
6062,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of tiryns and mycenae a point on which mr monro had doubts as regards
6063,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,tiryns while he accepted it for mycenae footnote monro odyssey ii
6068,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,there appears to be no doubt that in the centre of the great halls of
6069,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,tiryns and of mycenae as of the houses in homer was the hearth with
6070,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,two tall pillars on each side supporting a _louvre_ higher than the
6071,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,rest of the roof and permitting some at least of the smoke of
6072,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the fire to escape beside the fire were the seats of the master and
6073,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,mistress of the house of the minstrel and of honoured guests the
6074,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,place of honour was not on a dais at the inmost end of the hall like
6075,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the high table in college halls mr myres holds that in the homeric
6076,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,house the greek prodomos or forehouse was a chamber and was not
6077,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,identical with the greek aethousa or portico though he admits that
6078,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the two words are used indifferently to describe the sleeping place of
6079,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,a guest footnote _journal of hellenic studies_ xx 144 155 this
6080,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,was the case at tiryns and in the house of the father of phoenix
6081,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in the _iliad_ the _prodomos_ or forehouse and the _aethousa_ or
6082,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,portico are certainly separate things iliad ix 473 noack does not
6085,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,on mr myress showing the women in the house of odysseus had distinct
6086,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and separate quarters into which no man goes uninvited odysseus when at
6087,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,home has with his wife a separate bedroom and in his absence penelope
6088,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,sleeps upstairs where there are several chambers for various purposes
6090,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,granting that all this is so how do the pictures of the house given in
6091,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the final part of the _odyssey_ compare with those in the blank space
6092,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and with the accounts of the dwellings of menelaus and alcinous in the
6093,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,odyssey noack argues that the house of odysseus is unlike the other
6094,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,homeric houses because in these he reasons the women have no separate
6095,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,quarters and the lord and lady of the house sleep in the great hall
6096,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and have no other bedroom while there are no upper chambers in the
6097,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,houses of the _iliad_ except in two passages dismissed as late
6099,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,if all this be so then the homeric period as regards houses and
6100,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,domestic life belongs to an age apart not truly mycenaean and still
6103,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,it must be remembered that noack regards the odyssey as a composite and
6104,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in parts very late mosaic a view on which i have said what i think
6105,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in _homer and the epic_ according to this theory kirchhoff is the
6106,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,exponent of a popular form thereof the first book of the odyssey
6107,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,belongs to the latest stratum and is the copy of the general
6108,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,workerup whether he was the editor employed by pisistratus or a
6109,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,laborious amateur this theory is opposed by sittl who makes his point
6110,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,by cutting out as interpolations whatever passages do not suit his
6111,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,ideas and do suit kirchhoffsthis is the regular method of homeric
6112,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,criticism the whole cruise of telemachus book iv is also regarded
6113,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,as a late addition on this point english scholars hitherto have been
6114,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of the opposite opinion footnote cf monro _odyssey_ vol ii
6117,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the method of all parties is to regard repetitions of phrases as
6118,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,examples of borrowing except of course in the case of the earliest
6119,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,poet from whom the others pilfer and in other cases of praehomeric
6120,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,surviving epic formulae critics then dispute as to which recurrent
6121,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,passage is the earlier deciding of course as may happen to suit
6122,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,their own general theory in our opinion these passages are traditional
6123,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,formulae as in our own old ballads and in the _chansons de geste_ and
6124,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,noack also takes this view every now and then they may well be older
6125,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in many cases than _iliad_ and _odyssey_ or the poet having found
6127,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,occurred such passages so considered are no tests of earlier
6130,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,we now look into noacks theory of the homeric house where do the
6131,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,lord and lady sleep _not_ he says as odysseus and penelope do when
6132,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,odysseus is at home in a separate chamber _thalamos_ on the ground
6133,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,floor nor like gunnar and halgerda njals saga in an upper chamber
6134,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,they sleep _mucho domou_ that is not in a separate recess in the

6137,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,_muchos_ the innermost part _odyssey_ vii 8796 in the hall of
6138,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,odysseus the wooers retreat to the _muchos_ the innermost part of the

6145,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,recess of the lofty _domos_ that is in the recess of the _hall_ not
6146,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of the house odyssey vii 346 the same words are used of helen and
6147,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,menelaus odyssey iv 304 but when menelaus goes forth next morning
6148,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,he goes _ek thalamoio_ out of his _chamber_ _odyssey_ iv 310 but
6149,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,this says noack is a mere borrowing of odyssey ii 25 where the same
6150,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,words are used of telemachus leaving his chamber which undeniably was
6151,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,a separate chamber in the court eurycleia lighted him thither at night
6152,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,odyssey i 428 in odyssey iv 121 helen enters the hall from her
6153,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,fragrant lofty chamber so she _had_ a chamber not in the hall but
6154,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,says noack this verse is not original the late poet of _odyssey_
6155,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,iv has cribbed it from the early poet who composed _odyssey xix 53_
6156,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in that passage penelope comes from her chamber like artemis or golden
6157,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,aphrodite penelope _had_ a chamberbeing a lone lorn woman who
6158,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,could not sleep in a hall where the wooers sat up late drinkingand
6159,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the latest poet transfers this chamber to helen but however late and
6160,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,larcenous he may have been the poet of iv 121 certainly did not crib
6161,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the words of the poet of xix 53 for he says helen came out of
6163,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,fragrant however noack supposes that the late poet of book iv let
6164,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,helen have a chamber apart to lead up to the striking scene of her
6165,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,entry to the hall where her guests are sitting may helen not even have
6166,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,a boudoir in _odyssey_ iv 263 helen speaks remorsefully of having
6167,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,abandoned her chamber and husband and child with paris but the
6168,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,late poet says this according to noack because he finds that he is
6169,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in for a chamber so to speak at all events as a result of his having
6170,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,previously cribbed the word chamber from odyssey xix 53 otherwise
6171,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,we presume helen would have said that she regretted having left the
6172,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,recess of the lofty hall where she really did sleep footnote noack
6175,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the merit of this method of arguing may be left to the judgment of the
6176,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,reader who will remark that wedded pairs are not described as leaving
6177,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the hall when they go to bed they sleep in a recess of the lofty
6178,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,house the innermost part is this the same as the recess of the
6179,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,_hall_ or is it an innermost part of the _house_ who can be certain
6181,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the bridal chamber built so cunningly with the trunk of a tree for the
6182,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,support of the bed by odysseus odyssey xxiii 177204 is according
6183,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,to noack an exception a solitary freak of odysseus but we may reply
6184,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,that the _thalamos_ the separate chamber is no freak the freak by
6185,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,knowledge of which odysseus proves his identity is the use of the tree
6186,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in the construction of the bed blank space was highly original
6188,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,that separate chambers are needed for grownup children _because_ the
6189,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,parents sleep in the hall is no strong argument if the parents had a
6190,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,separate chamber the young people unless they slept in the hall would
6191,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,still need their own the girls of course could not sleep in the hall
6192,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and in the absence of both penelope and odysseus from the hall ever
6193,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,since telemachus was a baby telemachus could have slept there but it
6194,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,will be replied that the wooers did not beset the hall and penelope
6195,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,did not retire to a separate chamber till telemachus was a big boy of
6196,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,sixteen noack argues that he had a separate chamber though the hall
6199,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,where does noack think that in a normal homeric house the girls of
6200,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the family slept _they_ could not sleep in the hall and on the two
6201,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,occasions when the _iliad_ has to mention the chambers of the young
6202,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,ladies they are upper chambers as is natural but as noack wants
6203,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,to prove the house of odysseus with its upper chambers to be a late
6204,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,peculiar house he of course expunges the two mentions of girls upper
6205,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,chambers in the _odyssey_ the process is simple and easy
6207,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,we find _iliad_ xvii 36 that a son wedding in his fathers and
6208,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,mothers lifetime has a _thalamos_ built for him and a _muchos_
6209,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in the _thalamos_ where he leaves his wife when he goes to war this
6210,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,dwelling of grownup married children as in the case of the sons of
6211,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,priam has a _thalamos_ or _doma_ and a courtyardis a house in fact
6212,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,_iliad_ vi 3 16 here we seem to distinguish the bedchamber
6213,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,from the _doma_ which is the hall noack objects that when odysseus

6254,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,latest is said to be the song of demodocus about the loves of ares
6255,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,and aphrodite in the house of hephaestus footnote odyssey viii
6256,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,266300 we shall show that this opinion is far from certainly correct
6257,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,hephaestus sets a snare round the bed in his greek talamos and
6258,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,catches the guilty lovers _now_ was his greek talamos or bedroom
6259,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,also his diningroom if so the author of the song though so late
6260,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,knows what noack knows and what the poets who assign sleeping chambers
6261,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,to wedded folks do not know namely that neither married gods nor
6262,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,married men have separate bedrooms this is plain for he makes
6263,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,hephaestus stand at the front door of his house and shout to the gods
6264,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,to come and see the sinful lovers footnote ibid vi 304305 they
6265,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,all come and look on _from the front door_ _odyssey_ vii 325 which
6266,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,leads into the greek megaron the hall if the lovers are in bed in
6267,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the hall then hall and bedroom are all one and the terribly late poet
6268,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,who made this lay knows it though the late poets of the _odyssey_ and
6271,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,it would appear that the author of the lay is not late as we shall
6274,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,noack then will not allow man or god to have a separate wedding
6275,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,chamber nor women before the late parts of the _odyssey_ to have
6276,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,separate quarters except in the house of odysseus womens chambers
6277,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,do not exist in the homeric house footnote noack p 50 if so how
6278,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,remote is the true homeric house from the house of historical greece

6283,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in an upper chamber but the whole arrangement of upper chambers as
6284,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,womens apartments is as late says noack as the time of the poets and

6286,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,xxiii footnote noack p 68 at the earliest these books are said to
6287,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,be of the eighth century bc here the late poets have their innings at
6290,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,to prove the absence of upper rooms in the _iliad_ we have to abolish

6294,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,ii and the _catalogue_ of the _myrmidons_ book xvi are indeed

6296,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,brideprice which is supposed to be unknown to the authors of late
6299,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,stated briefly such are the ideas of noack they leave us at least
6300,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,with permission to hold that the whole of the epics except books xxi
6301,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,xxii and xxiii of the odyssey bear as regards the house the marks
6302,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of a distinct peculiar age coming between the period of mycenae and
6303,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,tiryns on one hand and the eighth century bc on the other
6305,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,this is the point for which we have contended and this suits our
6306,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,argument very well though we are sorry to see that odyssey books xxi
6307,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,xxii and xxiii are no older than the eighth century bc but we have
6308,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,not been quite convinced that helen had not her separate chamber that
6309,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,zeus had not his separate chamber and that the upper chambers of the
6310,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,daughters of the house in the iliad are late where if not in upper
6311,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,chambers did the young princesses repose again the marked separation
6312,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,of the women in the house of odysseus may be the result of penelopes
6313,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,care in unusual circumstances though she certainly would not build
6314,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,a separate hall for them there are over a hundred handsome young
6315,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,scoundrels in her house all day long and deep into the night she would

6321,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,upper chambers as in the iliad but if their lovers were gods we
6322,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,know that none can see a god coming or going against his will the
6323,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,arrangements of houses may and do vary in different cases in the same
6326,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,as examples we turn to the parallel afforded by the icelandic sagas and
6327,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,their pictures of houses of the eleventh century bc the present author

6352,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,rooms often a fifth was added the socalled bathroom the oldest form
6353,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,for houses was that of one long line or row of separate rooms united by
6354,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,wooden or clay corridors or partitions and each covered with a roof
6355,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,later this was considered unpractical and they began building some of
6356,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the houses or rooms behind the others which facilitated the access from
6357,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,one to another and diminished the number of outer doors and corridors
6359,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,towards the latter part of the tenth century the _skaal_ was used as
6360,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,common sleepingroom for the whole family including servants and serfs
6361,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,it was fitted up in the same way as the hall like this it was divided
6362,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,in three naves by rows of wooden pillars the middle floor was lower

6365,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,from gable to gable but sideways filling about a third part each
6366,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,_saet_ was enclosed by broad strong planks joined into the pillars but
6367,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,not nailed on so they might easily be taken out these planks called
6368,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,_sattestokke_ could also be turned sideways and used as benches during
6369,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,the day they were often beautifully carved and consequently highly
6372,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,when settling abroad the people took away with them these planks and
6373,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,put them up in their new home as a symbol of domestic happiness the

6454,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,chamber might be called _muchos_ it was private from the hall though
6455,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,under the same roof it appears not improbable that some homeric halls
6456,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,had sleeping places of this kind such a _muchos_ in iceland seems to
6457,THE HOMERIC HOUSE,have had windows footnote story of burnt _njal_ i 242

6921,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,many scholars detect two strata of earlier and later _grammar_ in iliad
6922,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and odyssey in the _iliad_ four or five books are infected by the
6923,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,later grammar while the odyssey in general seems to be contaminated
6924,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,mr leafs words are when we regard the epos in large masses we see
6925,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,that we can roughly arrange the inconsistent elements towards one end or
6926,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the other of a line of development both linguistic and historical the
6927,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,main division that of _iliad_ and odyssey shows a distinct advance
6928,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,along this line and the distinction is still more marked if we group
6929,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,with the _odyssey_ four books of the _iliad_ whose odyssean physiognomy
6930,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is well marked taking as our main guide the dissection of the plot as
6931,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,shown in its episodes we find that marks of lateness though nowhere
6932,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,entirely absent group themselves most numerously in the later additions
6933,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES, footnote _iliad_ vol ii p x we are here concerned with

6951,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,sun four times in the _odyssey_ 735 it is also possible that there
6956,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the real difficulty about odyssean words and grammar in the _iliad_
6957,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is that if they were in vigorous poetic existence down to the time of
6958,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,pisistratus as the odysseanism of the asiatic editor proves that they
6959,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,were and if every rhapsodist could add to and alter the materials at
6960,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the disposal of the pisistratean editor at will we are not told how the
6961,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,fashionable odysseanisms were kept on the whole out of twenty books of
6964,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,this is a point on which we cannot insist too strongly as an argument
6965,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,against the theory that till the middle of the sixth century bc the
6966,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_iliad_ scarcely survived save in the memory of strolling rhapsodists
6967,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,if that were so all the books of the _iliad_ would in the course
6968,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of recitation of old and composition of new passages be equally
6969,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,contaminated with late odyssean linguistic style it could not be
6970,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,otherwise all the books would be equally modified in passing through
6971,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the lips of modern reciters and composers therefore if twenty out
6972,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of twentyfour books are pure or pure in the main from odysseanisms
6973,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,while four are deeply stained with them the twenty must not only be
6974,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,earlier than the four but must have been specially preserved and kept
6975,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,uncontaminated in some manner inconsistent with the theory that all
6976,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,alike scarcely existed save in the memory or invention of late strolling
6979,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,how the twenty books relatively pure in grammatical forms in syntax
6980,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and in vocabulary could be kept thus clean without the aid of written
6981,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,texts i am unable to imagine if left merely to human memory and at
6982,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the mercy of reciters and new poets they would have become stained with
6983,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the defining articleand indeed an employment of the article which
6984,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,startles grammarians appears even in the eleventh line of the first
6985,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,book of the _iliad_ footnote exact placing uncertain cf monro and
6988,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,left merely to human memory and the human voice the twenty more
6989,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,or less innocent books would have abounded like the odyssey in
6990,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,greek amphi with the dative meaning about and with greek ex in
6991,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,consequence of and the extension of the use of greek ei clauses
6992,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,as final and objective clauses and similar marks of lateness so
6994,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,331333 but the twenty books are almost or quite inoffensive in
6997,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,now even in ages of writing it has been found difficult or impossible
6998,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to keep linguistic novelties and novelties of metre out of old epics we
6999,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,later refer _archaeology of the epic_ to the _chancun de willame_
7000,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of which an unknown benefactor printed two hundred copies in 1903
7001,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,mr raymond weeks in _romania_ describes _willame_ as taking a place
7002,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,beside the _chanson de roland_ in the earliest rank of _chansons de
7003,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,geste_ if the text can be entirely restored the poem will appear
7004,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,as the most primitive of french epics of the eleventh and twelfth
7005,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,centuries but it has passed from copy to copy in the course of
7006,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,generations the methods of versification change and after line 2647
7007,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,there are traces of change in the language the word _ço_ followed
7008,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,by a vowel hitherto frequent never again reappears the vowel _i_
7009,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of _li_ nominative masculine of the article _li reis_ the king
7010,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,never occurs in the text after line 2647 up to that point it is elided
7011,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,or not at pleasure there is a progressive tendency towards hiatus
7012,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,after line 1980 the system of assonance changes _an_ and en have
7013,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,been kept distinct hitherto this ceases to be the case footnote
7016,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the poem is also notable like the _iliad_ for textual repetition of
7017,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,passages but that is common to all early poetry which many homeric
7018,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,critics appear not to understand in this example we see how apt
7019,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,novelties in grammar and metre are to steal into even written copies of
7020,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,epics composed in and handed down through uncritical ages and we are
7021,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,confirmed in the opinion that the relatively pure and orthodox grammar
7022,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and metre of the twenty books must have been preserved by written texts
7023,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,carefully executed the other four books if equally old were less
7024,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,fortunate their grammar and metre we learn belong to a later stratum
7027,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,these opinions of grammarians are not compatible with the hypothesis
7028,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,that _all_ of the _iliad_ even the earliest parts are loaded with
7029,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,interpolations forced in at different places and in any age from 1000
7030,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,bc to 540 bc for if that theory were true the whole of the _iliad_
7031,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,would equally be infected with the later odyssean grammar according to
7034,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,but suppose on the other hand that the later odyssean grammar abounds
7035,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,all through the whole _iliad_ then that grammar is not more odyssean
7036,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,than it is iliadic the alleged distinction of early iliadic grammar
7037,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,late odyssean grammar in that case vanishes mr leaf is more keen than
7038,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,mr monro and sir richard jebb in detecting late grammar in the _iliad_
7039,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,beyond the bounds of books ix x xxiii xxiv but he does not carry
7040,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,these discoveries so far as to make the late grammar no less iliadic
7041,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,than odyssean in book viii of the _iliad_ which he thinks was only
7042,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,made for the purpose of introducing book ix footnote _iliad_ vol
7043,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,i p 332 1900 we ought to find the late odyssean grammar just as
7044,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,much as we do in book ix for it is of the very same date and probably
7045,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,by one or more of the same authors as book ix but we do not find the
7048,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,mr leaf says the peculiar character of book viii is easily
7049,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,understood when we recognise the fact that book viii is intended to
7050,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,serve only as a means for the introduction of book ix which is
7051,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,late and odyssean then book viii intended to introduce book ix
7052,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,must be at least as late as book ix and might be expected to be at
7053,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,least as odyssean indeed one would think it could not be otherwise yet
7056,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,mr leafs theory has thus to face the difficulty that while the whole
7057,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_iliad_ by his view for more than four centuries was stuffed with
7058,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,late interpolations in the course of oral recital through all
7059,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,greek lands and was crammed with original copy by a sycophant of
7060,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,pisistratus about 540 bc the late grammar concentrated itself in
7061,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,only some four books till some reasonable answer is given to this
7062,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,questionhow did twenty books of the iliad preserve so creditably
7063,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the ancient grammar through centuries of change and of recitation by
7064,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,rhapsodists who used the odyssean grammar which infected the four other
7065,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,books and the whole of the _odyssey_it seems hardly worth while to
7068,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,any scholar who looks at these pages knows all about the proofs of
7069,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,grammar of a late date in the _odyssey_ and the four contaminated books
7070,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of the _iliad_ but it may be well to give a few specimens for the
7073,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the use of greek amfi with the dative meaning about when
7074,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_thinking_ or _speaking_ about odysseus or anything else is peculiar
7075,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to the _odyssey_ but how has it not crept into the four odyssean
7078,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,greek peri with the genitive follows verbs meaning to speak
7079,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,or know _about_ a person but only in the _odyssey_ what preposition
7082,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,here again we ask how did the contaminated books of the _iliad_
7083,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,escape the stain of greek peri with the genitive after verbs
7084,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,meaning to speak or know what phrase do they use in the _iliad_ for
7089,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,comes twice in the odyssey x 320 xvi 140 and thrice in the _iliad_
7090,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,xiii 700 xxi 458 xxiv 400 but all these passages in the _iliad_
7094,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,person comes often in the _iliad_ once in the odyssey but it comes
7095,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,four times in _iliad_ book x which almost every critic scouts as very
7096,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,late indeed if so why does the late _odyssey_ not deal in this
7097,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,grammatical usage so common in the late book x of the _iliad_
7100,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,without _motion_ is chiefly found in the _odyssey_ and in the
7101,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,iliad ix x xxiv on consulting grammarians one thinks that there is
7104,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,greek proti with the dative meaning in addition to occurs
7105,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,only once _odyssey x 68_ if it occurs only once there is little to
7108,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,greek ana with the genitive is only in _odyssey_ only
7109,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,thrice always of going on board a ship there are not many shipfarings
7110,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in the _iliad_ odysseus and his men are not described as going on board
7111,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,their ship in so many words in _iliad_ book i the usage occurs in
7112,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the poem where the incidents of seafaring occur frequently as is to be
7113,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,expected it is not worth while to persevere with these tithes of mint
7114,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and cummin if neglect of position be commonerlike hiatus in the
7115,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,bucolic diaeresisin the _odyssey_ and in _iliad_ xxiii xxiv why
7116,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,do the failings not beset _iliad_ ix x these being such extremely
7117,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,late books as to the later use of the article in the _odyssey_ and
7118,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the odyssean books of the _iliad_ it appears to us that book i of the
7119,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_iliad_ uses the article as it is used in book x but on this topic we
7120,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,must refer to a special treatise on the language of _iliad_ book x
7123,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,turning to the vocabulary words expressive of civilisation are bound
7124,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to be more frequent as they are in the odyssey a poem of peaceful
7125,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,life than in a poem about an army in action like the _iliad_ out of
7126,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,all this no clue to the distance of years dividing the two poems can be
7127,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,found as to words concerning religion the same holds good the odyssey
7128,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is more frequently _religious_ see the case of eumaeus than the
7131,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in morals the term greek dikaios is more used in the _odyssey_ also
7132,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,greek atemistos just and lawless but that is partly because
7133,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the odyssey has to contrast civilised just with wild outlandish
7134,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,peoplecyclopes and laestrygons who are lawless the _iliad_ has no
7135,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,occasion to touch on savages but as the greek hybris of the wooers
7136,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is a standing topic in the odyssey an ethical poem says aristotle
7137,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the word greek hybris is of frequent occurrence in the _odyssey_
7138,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in just the same sense as it bears in _iliad_ i 214the insolence
7139,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of agamemnon yet when achilles has occasion to speak of agamemnons
7140,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,insolence in _iliad_ book ix he does not use the _word_ greek
7141,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,hybris though book ix is so very late and odyssean it would be
7142,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,easy to go through the words for moral ideas in the _odyssey_ and
7143,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to show that they occur in the numerous moral situations which do not
7144,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,arise or arise much less frequently in the _iliad_ there is not
7145,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,difference enough in the moral standard of the two poems to justify us
7146,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in assuming that centuries of ethical progress had intervened between
7147,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,their dates of composition if the _iliad_ again were really like the
7148,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_odyssey_ a thing of growth through several centuries which overlapped
7149,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the centuries in which the _odyssey_ grew the moral ideas of the
7150,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_iliad_ and _odyssey_ would necessarily be much the same would be
7151,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,indistinguishable but as a matter of fact it would be easy to show
7152,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,that the moral standard of the _iliad_ is higher in many places
7153,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,than the moral standard of the _odyssey_ and that therefore by the
7154,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,critical hypothesis the _iliad_ is the later poem of the twain for
7155,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,example the behaviour of achilles is most obnoxious to the moralist in
7156,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_iliad_ book ix where he refuses gifts of conciliation but by the
7157,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,critical hypothesis this is not the fault of the _iliad_ for book ix
7158,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is declared to be late and of the same date as late parts of the
7159,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_odyssey_ achilles is not less open to moral reproach in his abominable
7160,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,cruelty and impiety as shown in his sacrifice of prisoners of war and
7161,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,his treatment of dead hector in _iliad_ xxiii xxiv but these books
7162,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,also are said to be as late as the _odyssey_
7164,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the solitary realistic or naturalistic passage in homer with which
7165,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,a lover of modern problem novels feels happy and at home is the story
7166,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of phoenix about his seduction of his fathers mistress at the
7167,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,request of his mother what a charming situation but that occurs in an
7168,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,odyssean book of the _iliad_ book ix and thus odyssean seems lower
7169,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,not more advanced than iliadic taste in morals to be sure the poet
7172,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in the odyssey the hero to the delight of athene lies often and freely
7173,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and with glee the achilles of the _iliad_ hates a liar like the gates
7174,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of hades but he says so in an odyssean book book ix so there
7177,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,as to the odyssey being the work of a milder age consider the hanging
7178,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of penelopes maids and the abominable torture of melanthius there is
7179,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,no torturing in the blank space for the _iliad_ happens not to deal
7182,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_enfin_ there is no appreciable moral advance in the _odyssey_ on the
7183,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,moral standard of the _iliad_ it is rather the other way odysseus in
7184,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the _odyssey_ tries to procure poison for his arrowheads the person
7185,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to whom he applies is too moral to oblige him we never learn that
7186,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,a hero of the _iliad_ would use poisoned arrows the poet himself
7187,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,obviously disapproves in both poems the poet is always on the side of
7188,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,morality and of the highest ethical standard of his age the standard in
7189,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,both epics is the same in both some heroes fall short of the standard
7191,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to return to linguistic tests it is hard indeed to discover what mr
7192,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,leafs opinion of the value of linguistic tests of lateness really is
7193,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,it is on such fundamental discrepanciesas he has found in books ix
7194,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,xvithat we can depend _and on these alone_ when we come to dissect
7195,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the _iliad_  some critics have attempted to base their analysis on
7196,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,evidences from language but i do not think they are sufficient to
7197,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,bear the superstructure which has been raised on them footnote
7200,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,he goes on still placing a low value on linguistic tests alone to say
7201,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,it is on the broad grounds of the construction and motives of the poem
7202,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_and not on any merely linguistic considerations_ that a decision must
7205,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,but he contradicts these comfortable words when he comes to the latest
7206,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,expansions such as books xxiii xxiv the latest expansions are
7207,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,thoroughly in the spirit of those which precede _them on account of
7209,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,rather than the rest of the _iliad_ footnote _iliad_ vol ii p
7212,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,now as mr leaf has told us that we must depend on fundamental
7213,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,discrepancies on these alone when we want to dissect the _iliad_
7214,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,as he has told us that linguistic tests alone are not sufficient to
7215,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,bear the superstructure c how can we lop off two books only on
7216,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,account of linguistic evidence it would appear that on this point
7217,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,as on others mr leaf has entirely changed his mind but even in the
7218,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_companion_ p 388 he had amputated book xxiv for no fundamental
7219,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,discrepancy but because of its close kinship to the _odyssey_ as in
7222,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,here as in many other passages if we are to account for discrepancies
7223,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,by the theory of multiplex authorship we must decide that mr leafs
7224,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,books are the work of several critics not of one critic only but there
7225,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,is excellent evidence to prove that here we would be mistaken
7227,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,confessedly and regretfully no grammarian i remain unable in face of
7228,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,what seem contradictory assertions about the value of linguistic tests
7229,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,to ascertain what they are really worth and what if anything they
7232,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,mr monro allows much for the long insensible influence of attic
7233,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,recitation upon the homeric text  many attic peculiarities may
7234,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,be noted so much so that aristarchus thought homer must have been
7235,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,an athenian the poems suffered a gradual and unsystematic because
7237,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,which were the rhapsodists reciters in a later democratic age who
7238,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,wandered over all parts of greece and were likely to be influenced by
7239,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,all the chief forms of literature footnote monro _homeric grammar_
7244,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,mr monro was not only a great grammarian he had a keen appreciation
7245,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of poetry thus he was conspicuously uneasy in his hypothesis based on
7246,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,words and grammar that the two last books of the _iliad_ are by a late
7247,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,hand after quoting shelleys remark that in these two books homer
7248,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,truly begins to be himself mr monro writes in face of such
7249,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,testimony can we say that the book in which the climax is reached in
7250,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,which the last discords of the _iliad_ are dissolved in chivalrous pity
7251,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and regret is not the work of the original poet but of some homerid or
7254,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,mr monro with a struggle finally voted for grammar and other
7255,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,indications of lateness against shelley and against his own sense of
7256,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,poetry in a letter to me of may 1905 mr monro sketched a theory that
7257,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,book ix without which he said that he deemed an _achilleis_ hardly
7258,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,possible might be a _remanié_ representative of an earlier lay to the
7259,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,same general effect some greek shakespeare then treated an older poem
7260,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,on the theme of book ix as shakespeare treated old plays namely as a
7261,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,canvas to work over with a masters hand probably mr monro would
7262,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,not have gone _so_ far in the case of book xxiv _the repentance_ of
7263,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,achilles he thought it in too keen contrast with the brutality of book
7264,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,xxii obviously forgetting that in book xxiv achilles is infinitely
7265,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,more brutal than in book xxii and thought it inconsistent with the
7266,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,refusal of achilles to grant burial at the prayer of the dying hector
7267,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,and with his criminal treatment of the dead body of his chivalrous
7268,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,enemy but in book xxiv his ferocity is increased mr leaf shares
7269,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,mr monros view but mr leaf thinks that a greek audience forgave
7270,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,achilles because he was doing the will of heaven and fighting the
7272,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,volii p 429 1902 but the achzeans were not puritans of the
7273,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,sixteenth century moreover the trojans are as hellenic as the
7274,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,achzeans they converse clearly in the same language they worship
7275,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the same gods the achzeans cannot regard them unless on account of the
7276,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,breach of truce by no trojan but an ally as the covenanters regarded
7277,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,malignants their name for loyal cavaliers whom they also styled
7278,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,amalekites and treated as samuel treated agag the achaeans to whom
7281,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,others must decide on the exact value and import of odyssean grammar
7282,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,as a test of lateness and must estimate the probable amount of time
7283,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,required for the development of such linguistic differences as they find
7284,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in the _odyssey_ and _iliad_ in undertaking this task they may compare
7285,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the literary language of america as it was before 1860 and as it is now
7286,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the language of english literature has also been greatly modified in
7287,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the last forty years but our times are actively progressive in many
7288,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,directions linguistic variations might arise more slowly in the greece
7289,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of the epics we have already shown in the more appropriate instance
7290,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of the _chancun de willame_ that considerable varieties in diction and
7291,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,metre occur in a single ms of that poem a ms written probably within
7292,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,less than a century of the date of the poems composition
7294,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,we can also trace in _remaniements_ of the _chanson de roland_
7297,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,the process entails frequent modernisations and yet the basis of
7298,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,thirteenthcentury texts continues to be the version of the eleventh
7299,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,century it may be worth the while of scholars to consider these
7300,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,parallels carefully as regards the language and prosody of the odyssean
7301,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,books of the _iliad_ and to ask themselves whether the processes of
7302,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,alteration in the course of transmission which we know to have occurred
7303,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,in the history of the old french may not also have affected the
7304,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,_iliad_ though why the effect is mainly confined to four books remains
7305,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,a puzzle it is enough for us to have shown that if odyssean varies from
7306,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,iliadic language in all other respects the two poems bear the marks
7307,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,of the same age meanwhile a homeric scholar so eminent as mr t w
7308,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,allen says that the linguistic attack upon their age that of the
7309,LINGUISTIC PROOFS OF VARIOUS DATES,homeric poems may be said to have at last definitely failed and
7323,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",of all books in the blank space book x called the _doloneia_
7324,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",is most generally scouted and rejected the book in fact could be
7325,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",omitted and only a minutely analytic reader would perceive the lacuna
7326,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",he would remark that in iliad ix 6584 certain military preparations
7327,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",are made which if we suppress book x lead up to nothing and that
7328,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",in _iliad_ xiv 911 we find nestor with the shield of his son
7329,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",thrasymedes while thrasymedes has his fathers shield a fact not
7330,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",explained though the poet certainly meant something by it the
7331,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",explanation in both cases is found in book x which may also be thought
7332,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",to explain why the achaeans so disconsolate in book ix and why
7333,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",agamemnon so demoralised so gaily assume the offensive in book
7334,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",xi some ancient critics scholiast t and eustathius attributed the
7335,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",_doloneia_ to homer but supposed it to have been a separate composition
7336,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",of his added to the _iliad_ by pisistratus this merely proves that
7337,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",they did not find any necessity for the existence of the _doloneia_ mr
7338,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",allen who thinks that it always held its present place says the
7342,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",to understand the problem of the _doloneia_ we must make a summary of
7343,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",its contents in book ix 6584 at the end of the disastrous fighting
7344,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",of book viii the achaeans by nestors advice station an advanced

7355,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",the achaean chiefs then hold council and agamemnon sends the embassy
7356,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",to achilles the envoys bring back his bitter answer and all men go to
7357,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",sleep in their huts deeply discouraged as even odysseus avowed
7359,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",here the tenth book begins and it is manifest that the poet is
7360,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",thoroughly well acquainted with the ninth book without the arrangements
7361,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",made in the ninth book and without the despairing situation of that
7362,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",book his lay is impossible it will be seen that critics suppose him
7363,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",alternately to have quite failed to realise the conditions of life of
7364,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",the heroes of whom he sang that is if certain lines are genuine and
7365,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",also to be a peculiarly learned archaeologist and a valuable authority
7366,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",on weapons he is addicted to introducing fanciful touches of heroic
7367,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",simplicity says mr leaf and is altogether a puzzling personage to
7370,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",the book opens with the picture of agamemnon sleepless from anxiety
7371,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",while the other chiefs save menelaus are sleeping he hears the music
7372,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",of the joyous trojan pipes and flutes and sees the reflected glow
7373,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",of their campfires we must suppose for he could not see the fires
7374,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",themselves through the new wall of his own camp as critics very wisely
7375,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",remark he tears out his hair before zeus no one else does so in the
7376,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",_iliad_ but no one else is agamemnon alone and in despair
7378,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",he rises to consult nestor throwing a lions skin over his _chiton_
7379,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",and grasping a spear much noise is made about the furs such as this
7380,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",lions pelt which the heroes in book x throw about their shoulders
7381,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",when suddenly aroused that sportsmen like the heroes should keep the
7382,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",pelts of animals slain by them for use as coverlets and should throw on
7383,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",one of the pelts when aroused in a hurry is a marvellous thing to the
7384,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",critics they know that fleeces were used for coverlets of beds ix
7385,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",661 and pelts of wild animals slain by anchises cover his bed in the
7388,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",but the facts do not enlighten critics yet no facts could be more
7389,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",natural a scientific critic moreover never reflects that the poet is
7391,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",the cold air in a night of dread but not called to battle thus reichel
7392,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",says the poet knows so little about true heroic costume that he drapes
7393,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",the princes in skins of lions and panthers like giants but about a
7396,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",the simple explanation is that the poet has not hitherto had to tell
7397,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",us about men who are called up not to fight on a night that must have
7398,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",been chilly in war they do not wear skins though paris in archers
7399,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",equipment wears a pards skin iii 17 naturally the men throw over
7400,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",themselves their fur coverlets but nestor a chilly veteran prefers a
7401,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",_chiton_ and a wide doublefolded fleecy purple cloak the cloak lay

7405,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",we have more references to beds and to people in bed that a sportsman
7406,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",may have as many folk have now a fur coverlet and may throw it over
7407,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",him as a kind of dressinggown or bedgown is a simple circumstance
7410,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",if the poet knew so little as reichel supposed his omission of corslets
7411,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",is explained living in an age of corslets seventh century he being
7412,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",a literary man knew nothing about corslets or as he is also an acute
7413,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",archaeologist he knew too much he knew that they were not worn in
7414,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",the mycenaean prime so he did not introduce them the science of this
7415,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",remarkable ignoramus in _this_ view accounts for his being aware that
7416,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",pelts of animals were in vogue as coverlets just as fur dressinggowns
7417,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",were worn in the sixteenth century and he introduces them precisely as
7418,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",he leaves corslets out because he knows that pelts of fur were in use

7573,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",of _a_ fresh topic a confused night of dread of young men wearing the

7586,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",cannot believe that a poet of the seventh century had made excavations

7594,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",herakles in a lions skin peisander brought this costume into

7597,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",163164 the poet of the _doloneia_ was thus much better acquainted

7652,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",as not to mount the horses nor could the poet be so pedantic as not to

7705,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",is rather akin to comedy of a rough farcical kind but it was time for

7729,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",_iliad_ vol i p 424 it is not easy to understand this decision
7730,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",for as mr leaf had previously written about book ix 6068 the
7731,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",posting of the watch is at least not necessary to the story and it has
7732,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",a suspicious air of being merely a preparation for the next book which
7733,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",is much later and which turns entirely upon a visit to the sentinels
7736,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",now a military audience would not have pardoned the poet of book ix if
7737,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",in the circumstances of defeat with a confident enemy encamped within
7738,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",striking distance he had not made the achaeans throw forth their
7739,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",outposts the thing was inevitable and is not suspicious but the poet
7740,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",purposely makes the advanced guard consist of young men under nestors
7741,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",son and meriones he needs them for book x therefore the poet of book
7742,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",ix is the poet of book x preparing his effect in advance or the poet
7743,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",of book x is a man who cleverly takes advantage of book ix or he
7744,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",composed his poem of a night of terror and adventure in the air
7745,"""ILIAD,"" BOOK X.",and the editor of 540 bc having heard it recited and copied it out

7950,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,that several of the passages in which nestor speaks are very late
7952,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,is a critical opinion to which we have more than once alluded the first
7953,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,example is in _iliad_ ii 530568 this passage is meant at once
7954,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,to present nestor as the leading counsellor of the greek army and to
7955,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,introduce the coming _catalogue_ footnote leaf _iliad_ vol i p
7956,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,70 now the _catalogue_ originally formed an introduction to the whole
7957,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,cycle footnote ibid vol i p 87 but to repeat an earlier
7958,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,observation surely the whole cycle was much later than the period of
7959,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,pisistratus and his sons that is the compilation of the homeric and
7960,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,cyclic poems into one body of verse named the cycle is believed to
7963,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,it is objected that nestors advice in this passage separate thy

7965,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,place in the last year of the war but this suggestion for military
7966,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,reorganisation may be admitted as a mere piece of poetical perspective
7967,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,like helens description of the achaean chiefs in book iii or nestor
7968,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,may wish to return to an obsolete system of clan regiments the
7970,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,advice is noted as a touch of late attic influence but about the nature
7971,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,and origin of these social divisions we know so little that it is vain
7972,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,to argue about them the advice of nestor is an appeal to the clan
7974,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,often provedbut we have no information as to whether it existed in
7975,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,achaean times nestor speaks as the aged lochiel spoke to claverhouse
7976,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,before killiecrankie did the athenian army of the sixth century
7977,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,fight in clan regiments the device seems to belong to an earlier
7978,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,civilisation whether it survived in sixth century athens or not it is
7979,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,of course notorious that tribes and clans are most flourishing among
7980,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,the most backward people though they were welded into the constitution
7981,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,of athens the passage therefore cannot with any certainty be

8062,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,in the odyssey he thinks that the greek pherae of nestor is the
8063,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,aliphera of polybius and believes that the topography of nestor and of
8064,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,the journey of telemachus is correct the keladon is now the river or
8065,THE INTERPOLATIONS OF NESTOR,burn of saint isidore the iardanus is at the foot of mount kaiapha

8160,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,sanskrit finnish persian and early teutonic heroic poetry and _saga_
8161,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,decided that in our country as in others we fail to find any true
8162,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,parallel to the case of the homeric poems these poems must be

8177,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,heroic national poetry is needed before any one has a right to say that
8178,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,the study cannot aid our critical examination of the homeric problem
8179,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,many peoples have passed through a stage of culture closely analogous to
8180,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,that of achaean society as described in the _iliad_ and odyssey every
8181,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,society of this kind has had its ruling military class its ancient

8183,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,the similarity of human nature under similar conditions makes it certain
8184,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,that comparison will discover useful parallels between the poetry of
8185,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,societies separated in time and space but practically identical in
8186,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,culture it is not much to the credit of modern criticism that a topic
8187,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,so rich and interesting has been at least in england almost entirely
8190,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,meanwhile it is perfectly correct to say as sir richard observes that
8191,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,we fail to find any true parallel to the case of the homeric poems

8193,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,poetthe greatest of all poetsexcept in the _iliad_ and _odyssey_
8194,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,but on the other hand the critics refuse to believe that in the
8195,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,_iliad_ and _odyssey_ we possess the heroic achaean legends handled by
8196,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,one great poet they find a composite by many hands good and bad and
8197,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,of many ages they say sometimes the whole composition and part of the
8198,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,poems are ascribed to a late _littérateur_ now to that supposed state
8199,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,of things we do find several true parallels in germany in finland
8200,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,in ireland but the results of work by these many hands in many ages are
8201,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,anything but a true parallel to the results which lie before us in
8202,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,the _iliad_ and _odyssey_ where the processes of composite authorship
8203,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,throughout many _ages_ certainly occur as in germany and ireland there
8204,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,we find no true parallel to the homeric poems it follows that in all
8205,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,probability no such processes as the critics postulate produced the
8206,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,_iliad_ and odyssey for where the processes existed beyond doubt they
8209,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,sir richards argument would have been logical if many efforts by many
8210,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,hands in many ages in england finland ireland iceland and germany
8211,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,did actually produce true parallels to the achaean epics they did not
8212,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,and why not simply because these other races had no homer all the
8214,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,heroic society the court minstrels allexcept the great poet in
8217,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,minstrels had rich material in legendary history and in myth and
8218,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,_märchen_ and old songs but none of the minstrels was adequate to the
8219,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,production of an english german or irish _iliad_ or _odyssey_ or even
8222,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,we have tried to show that the critics rejecting a homer have been
8223,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,unable to advance any adequate hypothesis to account for the existence
8224,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,of the _iliad_ and _odyssey_ now we see that where such conditions of
8225,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,production as they postulate existed but where there was no great epic
8226,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,genius they can find no true parallels to the epics their logic thus
8229,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,it may be replied that in nongreek lands one condition found in greek
8230,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,society failed the succession of a reading age to an age of heroic
8231,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,listeners but this is not so in france and germany an age of readers
8232,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,duly began but they did not mainly read copies of the old heroic poems
8233,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,they turned to lyric poetry as in greece and they recast the heroic
8234,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,songs into modern and popular forms in verse and prose when they took
8237,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,one merit of the greek epics is a picture of a certain phase of early
8238,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,civilisation and that picture is a naturally harmonious whole with
8239,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,unity of impression says sir richard jebb footnote homer p 37
8240,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,certainly we can find no true parallel on an homeric scale to this
8241,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,harmonious picture in the epics of germany and england or in the
8242,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,early literature of ireland sir richard for england omits notice of
8243,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,_beowulf_ but we know that _beowulf_ a long heroic poem is a mass of
8244,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,anachronismsa heathen legend in a christian setting the hero that
8245,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,great heathen champion has his epic filled full of christian allusions
8247,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,england could not but intrude these things into old pagan legends
8248,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,evolved by the continental ancestors of our race he had no painful
8249,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,anxiety like the supposed ionic continuators of the achaean poems
8250,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,when they are not said to have done precisely the reverse to preserve
8254,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,if we take the _nibelungenlied_ footnote see chapter on the
8255,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,_nibelungenlied_ in homer _and the epic_ pp 382404 we find that
8256,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,it is a thing of many rehandlings even in existing manuscripts for
8257,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,example the greeks clung to the hexameter in homer not so did the
8258,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,germans adhere to old metres the poem that in the oldest ms is
8259,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,written in assonances in later mss is reduced to regular rhymes and is
8260,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,retouched in many essential respects the matter of the _nibelungenlied_
8261,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,is of heathen origin we see the real state of heathen affairs in the
8262,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,icelandic versions of the same tale for the icelanders were peculiar in
8263,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,preserving ancient lays and when these were woven into a prose saga
8264,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,the archaic and heathen features were retained had the postchristian
8265,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,prose author of the _volsunga_ been a great poet we might find in
8266,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,his work a true parallel to the _iliad_ but though he preserves the
8267,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,harmony of his picture of prechristian princely life save in the
8268,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,savage beginnings of his story he is not a poet so the true parallel
8269,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,to the greek epic fails noble as is the saga in many passages in the
8271,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,the manners are chivalrous and _märchen_ older than homer are forced
8272,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,into a wandering mediaeval chroniclepoem the germans in short had no
8273,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,early poet of genius and therefore could not produce a true parallel
8274,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,to _iliad_ or odyssey the mediaeval poets of course never dreamed
8276,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,sometimes said to have done any more than did the french and late welsh
8278,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,german _bearbeiter_ of the _nibelungenlied_ has no idea of unity of
8280,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,for an epic but producing no parallel to _iliad_ and odyssey only
8281,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,proves how absolutely essential a homer was to the greek epics
8283,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,if any inference could properly be drawn from the edda the icelandic
8284,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,collection of heroic lays says sir richard jebb it would be that
8285,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,short separate poems on cognate subjects can long exist as a collection
8286,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,_without_ coalescing into such an artistic whole as the iliad or the
8289,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,it is our own argument that sir richard states short separate poems
8290,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,on cognate subjects can certainly coexist for long anywhere but they
8291,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,cannot automatically and they cannot by aid of an editor become a long
8292,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,epic nobody can stitch and vamp them into a poem like the _iliad_ or
8293,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,odyssey to produce a poem like either of these a great poetic genius
8294,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,must arise and fuse the ancient materials as hephaestus fused copper
8295,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,and tin and then cast the mass into a mould of his own making a small
8296,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,poet may reduce the legends and lays into a very inartistic whole a
8297,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,very inharmonious whole as in the _nibelungenlied_ but a controlling
8298,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,poet not a mere redactor or editor is needed to perform even that
8301,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,where a man who is not a poet undertakes to produce the coalescence
8302,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,as dr lönnrot 18351849 did in the case of the peasant not courtly
8303,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,lays of finland he fails to prove that mere combining and editing can
8304,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,form an artistic whole out of originally distinct songs even though
8308,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,this is perfectly true much as lönnrot botched and vamped the finnish
8309,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,lays he made no epic out of them but as it is true how did the late
8310,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,athenian drudge of pisistratus succeed where lönnrot failed in the
8311,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,dovetailing of the _odyssey_ we see the work of one mind says sir
8312,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,richard footnote homer p 129 this mind cannot have been the
8313,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,property of any one but a great poet obviously as the _odyssey_ is
8315,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,odyssey when they are logical are reduced to averring that the poem is
8316,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,an exceedingly inartistic whole a whole not artistic at all while mr
8317,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,leaf calls it a model of skilful construction wilamowitz mollendorff
8318,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,denounces it as the work of a slenderlygifted botcher of about 650
8321,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,thus we come after all to a crisis in which mere literary appreciation
8322,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,is the only test of the truth about a work of literature the odyssey is
8323,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,an admirable piece of artistic composition or it is the very reverse

8325,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,that the composition is excellent a crowd of german critics and father
8326,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,browne sj hold that the composition is feeble the criterion is the

8330,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,excellent construction the world has judged the _odyssey_ is a
8331,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,marvel of construction therefore is not the work of a late botcher of
8332,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,disparate materials but of a great early poet yet sir richard jebb
8333,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,while recognising the _odyssey_ as an artistic whole and an harmonious

8335,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,and editing can form an artistic whole out of originally distinct
8336,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,songs even though concerned with closely related themes thinks that
8337,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,kirchhoff has made the essence of his theory of late combination of

8339,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,in the _odyssey_ in the highest degree probable footnote homer p

8343,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,_odyssey_ may now in deference to his belief in the pisistratean
8344,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,editor have changed his opinion of the merits of the poem if the

8350,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,that the composition of the _odyssey_ is a masterpiece then the
8351,THE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EARLY EPICS,pisistratean editor was a great master of construction if he now on

8363,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,sir richard jebb remarks with truth that before any definite solution
8364,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,of the homeric problem could derive scientific support from such
8365,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,analogies with epics of other peoples it would be necessary to show

8560,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,an interval of more than two thousand years agamemnon is the bretwalda
8561,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the overlord as mr freeman used to say of the achaeans he is the
8562,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,suzerain charles in the french epics holds the same position but the
8563,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,french poets regard him in different lights in the earliest epic the
8564,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,_chanson_ de roland a divinity doth hedge the famous emperor whom
8565,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,jeanne darc styled st charlemagne he was in fact a man of
8566,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,thirtyseven at the date of the disaster of roncesvaux where roland
8567,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,fell 778 ad but in the tradition that has reached the poet of the
8568,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,_chanson_ he is a whitebearded warrior as vigorous as he is venerable
8569,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,as he rules by advice of his council he bids them deliberate on the
8570,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,proposals of the paynim king marsileto accept or refuse them roland
8571,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the counterpart of achilles in all respects oliver is his patroclus
8572,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,is for refusing ganelon appears to have the rest with him when he
8573,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,speaks in favour of peace and return to france out of spain so in
8574,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the _iliad_ ii the achaeans lend a ready ear to agamemnon when he
8575,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,proposes the abandonment of the siege of troy each host french and
8578,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,ganelons advice prevailing it is necessary to send an envoy to the
8579,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,saracen court it is a dangerous mission other envoys have been sent
8580,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,and been murdered the peers however volunteer beginning with the
8581,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,aged naismes the nestor of the franks his offer is not accepted
8582,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,nor are those of oliver roland and turpin roland then proposes that
8583,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,ganelon shall be sent and hence arises the wrath of ganelon which was
8584,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the ruin of roland and the peers who stood by him the warriors attack
8585,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,each other in speeches of homeric fury charles preserves his dignity
8586,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,and ganelon departs on his mission he deliberately sells himself
8587,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,and seals the fate of the peers whom he detests the surprise of the
8588,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,rearguard under roland the deadly battle and the revenge of charles
8589,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,make up the rest of the poem not even in victory is charles allowed
8590,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,repose the trumpet again summons him to war he is of those whom heaven
8594,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,skeins of grievous wars till every soul of them perish
8598,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,such is the picture of the imperial charles in one of the oldest of the
8599,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,french epics the heart of the poet is with the aged but unbroken and
8600,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,truly imperial figure of st charlemagnewise just and brave a true
8601,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,shepherd of the people regarded as the conqueror of all the known

8603,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,conscience of a knight among his warring members the greatness of
8604,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,charlemagne has entered even into his name but as time went on and
8605,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the feudal princes began the long struggle against the french king the
8606,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,poets gratified their patrons by degrading the character of the emperor
8607,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,they created a second type of charles and it is the second type that on
8610,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,we ask why the widely ruling lord of golden mycenae is so skilfully
8611,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,and persistently represented as respectable indeed by reason of his
8614,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the answer is that just as the second type of charles is the result of
8615,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,feudal jealousies of the king so the character of agamemnon reflects
8616,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the princely hatreds of what we may call the feudal age of greece the
8617,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,masterly portrait of agamemnon could only have been designed to win
8618,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the sympathies of feudal listeners princes with an overlord whom they
8619,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,cannot repudiate for whose office they have a traditional reverence
8620,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,but whose power they submit to with no good will and whose person and
8624,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,what may be called a feudal society and the attitudes of the achaean
8625,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,bretwalda and of his peers are from beginning to end of the _iliad_ and

8630,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,on the story of his incest with his sister gilain whence sprang

8670,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,agamemnon endure the lowest disgraces which the latest french epic poets
8671,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,heap on charles but we see how close is the parallel between agamemnon

8673,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,feudal jealousy of the overlord both reflect real antique historical
8674,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,conditions and these were the conditions of the achaeans in europe not
8678,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,is not as if in the original poem agamemnon were revered like st

8687,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the late rhapsodists in their irresponsible lays would have presented
8690,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,the conditions under which the _chansons_ arose were truly parallel
8691,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,to the conditions under which the homeric poems arose and the poems
8692,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,french and achaean are also true parallels except in genius the
8693,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,french have no homer _cared vate sacro_ it follows that a homer was
8696,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,it may perhaps be replied to this argument that our _iliad_ is only
8697,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,a very late _remaniement_ like the fourteenth century _chansons de
8698,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,geste_ of something much earlier and nobler but in france in the age
8699,HOMER AND THE FRENCH MEDIAEVAL EPICS,of _remaniement_ even the versification had changed from assonance to

9055,CONCLUSION,there is no external evidence of any description which leads us to
9056,CONCLUSION,suppose that the _iliad_ was ever expanded _j h s_ vii 291308
9058,CONCLUSION,that it was expanded is a mere hypothesis based on the idea that if
9059,CONCLUSION,there was an _iliad_ at all in the ninth century its length must
9060,CONCLUSION,have been such as was compatible with the conditions of an oral

9066,CONCLUSION,there were no such narrow limits imposed on the length of a poem orally
9069,CONCLUSION,the length of the _iliad_ yields therefore no argument for expansions
9071,CONCLUSION,that the original poem _must_ have been short is next supposed to be
9072,CONCLUSION,warranted by the inconsistencies and discrepancies but we argue that
9073,CONCLUSION,these are only visible as a rule to the analytical reader for whom
9074,CONCLUSION,the poet certainly was not composing that they occur in all long

9080,CONCLUSION,these critical plots we have shown do not account for the facts of the

9082,CONCLUSION,into unperceived selfcontradictions which they would not pardon in the
9083,CONCLUSION,poet these contradictions are visible to the analytical reader who
9084,CONCLUSION,concludes that a very early poet may have been though homer seldom is
9087,CONCLUSION,meanwhile though we have no external evidence that the _iliad_ was
9088,CONCLUSION,ever expandedthat it was expanded is an explanatory myth of the
9089,CONCLUSION,criticswe do know on good evidence says mr jevons that the
9090,CONCLUSION,_iliad_ was rhapsodised the rhapsodists were men as a rule of one
9091,CONCLUSION,day recitations though at a prolonged festival at athens there was time
9092,CONCLUSION,for the whole _iliad_ to be recited they chose for recitation such
9093,CONCLUSION,incidents as could be readily detached were interesting in themselves
9094,CONCLUSION,and did not take too long to recite mr jevons suggests that the many
9095,CONCLUSION,brief poems collected in the homeric hymns are invocations which the
9096,CONCLUSION,rhapsodists preluded to their recitals the practice seems to have been
9097,CONCLUSION,for the rhapsodist first to pay his reverence to the god to begin from
9098,CONCLUSION,the god at whose festival the recitation was being given the short
9099,CONCLUSION,proems collected in the hymns pay this reverence and then proceed

9103,CONCLUSION,conclusion of the proem often is i will be mindful both of thee and
9104,CONCLUSION,of another lay meaning says mr jevons that the local deity will
9105,CONCLUSION,figure in the recitation from homer which the rhapsodist is about to

9116,CONCLUSION,there is practically nothing said in the _iliad_ for it is a proof of
9117,CONCLUSION,the antiquity of the _iliad_ that when it was composed dionysus had
9118,CONCLUSION,not been raised to the olympian peerage being still a folkgod only
9119,CONCLUSION,the rhapsodist at a feast of dionysus in later times has to introduce
9120,CONCLUSION,the god into his recitation the god is not in his text but he adds
9123,CONCLUSION,why should any mortal have made this interpolation mr jevonss theory
9124,CONCLUSION,supplies the answer the rhapsodist added the passages to suit the
9127,CONCLUSION,the same explanation is offered for the long story of the _birth_
9128,CONCLUSION,of blank space which agamemnon tells in his speech of apology and
9130,CONCLUSION,heracles hymns xv and the author may have added this speech to his
9131,CONCLUSION,rhapsody of the reconciliation recited at a feast of heracles perhaps
9132,CONCLUSION,the remark of mr leaf offers the real explanation of the presence of
9133,CONCLUSION,this long story in the speech of agamemnon many speakers with a bad
9134,CONCLUSION,case take refuge in telling stories agamemnon shows says mr leaf
9135,CONCLUSION,the peevish nervousness of a man who feels that he has been in the
9136,CONCLUSION,wrong and who follows a frank speaker like achilles only eager for
9137,CONCLUSION,agamemnon to give the word to form and charge so agamemnon takes refuge
9138,CONCLUSION,in a long story throwing the blame of his conduct on destiny
9140,CONCLUSION,we do not need then the theory of a rhapsodists interpolation but it
9143,CONCLUSION,local heroes as well as gods had their feasts in posthomeric times
9144,CONCLUSION,and a reciter at a feast of aeneas or of his mother aphrodite may
9145,CONCLUSION,have foisted in the very futile discourse of achilles and aeneas
9149,CONCLUSION,in other cases the rhapsodist rounded off his selected passage by a few
9150,CONCLUSION,lines as in _iliad_ xiii 656659 where a hero is brought to follow
9151,CONCLUSION,his sons dead body to the grave though the father had been killed
9152,CONCLUSION,in _v 576_ it is really such a slip as is often made by authors who
9153,CONCLUSION,write says mr leaf and in _esmond_ thackeray makes similar
9154,CONCLUSION,errors the passage in xvi 6980 about which so much is said as if it
9155,CONCLUSION,contradicted book ix _the embassy to achilles_ is also mr jevons
9156,CONCLUSION,thinks to be explained as inserted by a rhapsodist wishing to make
9157,CONCLUSION,his extract complete in itself another examplethe confusion in the
9158,CONCLUSION,beginning of book iiwe have already discussed see chapter iv and
9159,CONCLUSION,do not think that any explanation is needed when we understand that
9160,CONCLUSION,agamemnon once wideawake had no confidence in his dream however mr
9161,CONCLUSION,jevons thinks that rhapsodists anxious to recite straight on from the
9162,CONCLUSION,dream to the battle added ii 3541 the only lines which represent
9163,CONCLUSION,agamemnon as believing confidently in his dream we have argued that he
9164,CONCLUSION,only believed _till he awoke_ and then as always wavered
9166,CONCLUSION,thus in our way of looking at these things interpolations by
9167,CONCLUSION,rhapsodists are not often needed as explanations of difficulties still
9168,CONCLUSION,granted that the rhapsodists like the _jongleurs_ had texts and that
9169,CONCLUSION,these were studied by the makers of the vulgate interpolations and
9170,CONCLUSION,errors might creep in by this way as to changes in language a
9171,CONCLUSION,poetical dialect is liable to be gradually modified by the influence
9172,CONCLUSION,of the everchanging colloquial speech and in the early times when
9173,CONCLUSION,writing was little used this influence would be especially operative
9176,CONCLUSION,to conclude the hypothesis of a school of mnemonic teaching of the
9177,CONCLUSION,_iliad_ would account for the preservation of so long a poem in an age
9178,CONCLUSION,destitute of writing when memory would be well cultivated there may
9179,CONCLUSION,have been such schools we only lack evidence for their existence but
9180,CONCLUSION,against the hypothesis of the existence of early texts there is nothing
9181,CONCLUSION,except the feeling of some critics that it is not likely they are
9184,CONCLUSION,in any case the opinion that the _iliad_ was a whole centuries before
9185,CONCLUSION,pisistratus is the hypothesis which is by far the least fertile in
9187,CONCLUSION,problems which the theory of expansion first raises and then like an
