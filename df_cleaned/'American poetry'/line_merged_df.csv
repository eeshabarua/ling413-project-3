0,I,in the acadian land on the shores of the basin of minas
1,I,lay in the fruitful valley  vast meadows stretched to the eastward
2,I,giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number
3,I,dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant
4,I,shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the floodgates
5,I,opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will oer the meadows
6,I,west and south there were fields of flax and orchards and cornfields
7,I,spreading afar and unfenced oer the plain and away to the northward
8,I,blomidon rose and the forests old and aloft on the mountains
9,I,seafogs pitched their tents and mists from the mighty atlantic
10,I,looked on the happy valley but neer from their station descended
11,I,there in the midst of its farms reposed the acadian village
12,I,strongly built were the houses with frames of oak and of chestnut
13,I,such as the peasants of normandy built in the reign of the henries
14,I,there in the tranquil evenings of summer when brightly the sunset
15,I,lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys
16,I,matrons and maidens sat in snowwhite caps and in kirtles
17,I,scarlet and blue and green with distaffs spinning the golden
18,I,flax for the gossiping looms whose noisy shuttles within doors
19,I,mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens
20,I,solemnly down the street came the parish priest and the children
21,I,paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them
22,I,reverend walked he among them and up rose matrons and maidens
23,I,then came the laborers home from the field and serenely the sun sank
24,I,down to his rest and twilight prevailed  anon from the belfry
25,I,softly the angelus sounded and over the roofs of the village
26,I,columns of pale blue smoke like clouds of incense ascending
27,I,rose from a hundred hearths the homes of peace and contentment
28,I,dwelt in the love of god and of man  alike were they free from
29,I,fear that reigns with the tyrant and envy the vice of republics
30,I,neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows
31,I,but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners
32,I,there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance
33,I,somewhat apart from the village and nearer the basin of minas
34,I,dwelt on his goodly acres and with him directing his household
35,I,gentle evangeline lived his child and the pride of the village
36,I,stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters
37,I,hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snowflakes
38,I,white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oakleaves
39,I,fair was she to behold that maiden of seventeen summers
40,I,black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside
41,I,black yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses
42,I,sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows
43,I,when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide
44,I,flagons of homebrewed ale ah fair in sooth was the maiden
45,I,fairer was she when on sunday morn while the bell from its turret
46,I,sprinkled with holy sounds the air as the priest with his hyssop
47,I,down the long street she passed with her chaplet of beads and her missal
48,I,wearing her norman cap and her kirtle of blue and the earrings
49,I,brought in the olden time from france and since as an heirloom
50,I,shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession
51,I,when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music
52,I,firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer
53,I,stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady
54,I,sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it
55,I,rudely carved was the porch with seats beneath and a footpath
56,I,led through an orchard wide and disappeared in the meadow
57,I,such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside
58,I,built oer a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary
59,I,farther down on the slope of the hill was the well with its mossgrown
60,I,bucket fastened with iron and near it a trough for the horses
61,I,shielding the house from storms on the north were the barns and the farmyard
62,I,there stood the broadwheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows
63,I,there were the folds for the sheep and there in his feathered seraglio
64,I,strutted the lordly turkey and crowed the cock with the selfsame
65,I,voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent peter
66,I,bursting with hay were the barns themselves a village  in each one
67,I,far oer the gable projected a roof of thatch and a staircase
68,I,under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous cornloft
69,I,there too the dovecot stood with its meek and innocent inmates
70,I,murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes
71,I,thus at peace with god and the world the farmer of grandpré
72,I,lived on his sunny farm and evangeline governed his household
73,I,many a youth as he knelt in the church and opened his missal
74,I,fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion
75,I,happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment
76,I,many a suitor came to her door by the darkness befriended
77,I,and as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps
78,I,knew not which beat the louder his heart or the knocker of iron
79,I,or at the joyous feast of the patron saint of the village
80,I,bolder grew and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered
81,I,hurried words of love that seemed a part of the music
82,I,but among all who came young gabriel only was welcome
83,I,who was a mighty man in the village and honored of all men
84,I,for since the birth of time throughout all ages and nations
85,I,has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people
86,I,grew up together as brother and sister and father felician
87,I,priest and pedagogue both in the village had taught them their letters
88,I,out of the selfsame book with the hymns of the church and the plainsong
89,I,but when the hymn was sung and the daily lesson completed
90,I,swiftly they hurried away to the forge of basil the blacksmith
91,I,there at the door they stood with wondering eyes to behold him
92,I,take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything
93,I,nailing the shoe in its place while near him the tire of the cartwheel
94,I,lay like a fiery snake coiled round in a circle of cinders
95,I,oft on autumnal eves when without in the gathering darkness
96,I,bursting with light seemed the smithy through every cranny and crevice
97,I,warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows
98,I,and as its panting ceased and the sparks expired in the ashes
99,I,merrily laughed and said they were nuns going into the chapel
100,I,oft on sledges in winter as swift as the swoop of the eagle
101,I,down the hillside bounding they glided away oer the meadow
102,I,oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters
103,I,seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow
104,I,brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings
105,I,lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow
106,I,thus passed a few swift years and they no longer were children
107,I,he was a valiant youth and his face like the face of the morning
108,I,gladdened the earth with its light and ripened through into action
109,I,she was a woman now with the heart and hopes of a woman
110,I,sunshine of saint eulalie was she called for that was the sunshine
111,I,which as the farmers believed would load their orchards with apples
112,I,she too would bring to her husbands house delight and abundance
113,I,filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children
114,II.,now had the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer
115,II.,and the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters
116,II.,birds of passage sailed through the leaden air from the icebound
117,II.,harvests were gathered in and wild with the winds of september
118,II.,wrestled the trees of the forest as jacob of old with the angel
119,II.,bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey
120,II.,cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes
121,II.,such was the advent of autumn  then followed that beautiful season
122,II.,called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of allsaints
123,II.,filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light and the landscape
124,II.,lay as if newcreated in all the freshness of childhood
125,II.,peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean
126,II.,was for a moment consoled  all sounds were in harmony blended
127,II.,voices of children at play the crowing of cocks in the farmyards
128,II.,whir of wings in the drowsy air and the cooing of pigeons
129,II.,all were subdued and low as the murmurs of love and the great sun
130,II.,looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him
131,II.,while arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow
132,II.,bright with the sheen of the dew each glittering tree of the forest
133,II.,flashed like the planetree the persian adorned with mantles and jewels
134,II.,now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness
135,II.,day with its burden and heat had departed and twilight descending
136,II.,brought back the evening star to the sky and the herds to the homestead
137,II.,pawing the ground they came and resting their necks on each other
138,II.,and with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening
139,II.,proud of her snowwhite hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar
140,II.,quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection
141,II.,then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside
142,II.,where was their favorite pasture  behind them followed the watchdog
143,II.,patient full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct
144,II.,walking from side to side with a lordly air and superbly
145,II.,regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept their protector
146,II.,when from the forest at night through the starry silence the wolves howled
147,II.,late with the rising moon returned the wains from the marshes
148,II.,laden with briny hay that filled the air with its odor
149,II.,cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks
150,II.,while aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles
151,II.,painted with brilliant dyes and adorned with tassels of crimson
152,II.,unto the milkmaids hand whilst loud and in regular cadence
153,II.,lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farmyard
154,II.,echoed back by the barns  anon they sank into stillness
155,II.,heavily closed with a jarring sound the valves of the barndoors
156,II.,rattled the wooden bars and all for a season was silent
157,II.,sat in his elbowchair and watched how the flames and the smokewreaths
158,II.,struggled together like foe in a burning city  behind him
159,II.,darted his own huge shadow and vanished away into darkness
160,II.,faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his armchair
161,II.,laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser
162,II.,caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine
163,II.,fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas
164,II.,such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him
165,II.,close at her fathers side was the gentle evangeline seated
166,II.,spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her
167,II.,silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle
168,II.,while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe
169,II.,followed the old mans song and united the fragments together
170,II.,as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases
171,II.,footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar
172,II.,so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked
173,II.,thus as they sat there were footsteps heard and suddenly lifted
174,II.,sounded the wooden latch and the door swung back on its hinges
175,II.,benedict knew by the hobnailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith
176,II.,and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him
177,II.,welcome the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold
178,II.,welcome basil my friend  come take thy place on the settle
179,II.,close by the chimneyside which is always empty without thee
180,II.,take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco
181,II.,never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling
182,II.,smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams
183,II.,round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes
184,II.,then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith
185,II.,taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside
186,II.,benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad
187,II.,ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with
188,II.,gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them
189,II.,happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe
190,II.,pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him
191,II.,and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued
192,II.,four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors
193,II.,ride in the gaspereaus mouth with their cannon pointed against us
194,II.,what their design may be is unknown but all are commanded
195,II.,on the morrow to meet in the church where his majestys mandate
196,II.,will be proclaimed as law in the land  alas in the mean time
197,II.,many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people
198,II.,brings these ships to our shores  perhaps the harvests in england
199,II.,and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children
200,II.,not so thinketh the folk in the village said warmly the blacksmith
201,II.,shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued
202,II.,louisburg is not forgotten nor beau séjour nor port royal
203,II.,many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts
204,II.,arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds
205,II.,nothing is left but the blacksmiths sledge and the scythe of the mower
206,II.,then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer
207,II.,safer are we unarmed in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields
208,II.,than our fathers in forts besieged by the enemys cannon
209,II.,fear no evil my friend and tonight may no shadow of sorrow
210,II.,fall on this house and hearth for this is the night of the contract
211,II.,built are the house and the barn  the merry lads of the village
212,II.,strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them
213,II.,filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth
214,II.,rené leblanc will be here anon with his papers and inkhorn
215,II.,shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children
216,II.,as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lovers
217,II.,blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken
218,II.,and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered
219,III.,bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean
220,III.,bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public
221,III.,shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung
222,III.,over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows
223,III.,sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal
224,III.,father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred
225,III.,childrens children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick
226,III.,four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive
227,III.,suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english
228,III.,ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike
229,III.,he was beloved by all and most of all by the children
230,III.,for he told them tales of the loupgarou in the forest
231,III.,and of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses
232,III.,and of the white létiche the ghost of a child who unchristened
233,III.,died and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children
234,III.,and how on christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable
235,III.,and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell
236,III.,and of the marvellous powers of fourleaved clover and horseshoes
237,III.,with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village
238,III.,then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith
239,III.,knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand
240,III.,father leblanc he exclaimed thou hast heard the talk in the village
241,III.,and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand
242,III.,gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser
243,III.,and what their errand may be i know not better than others
244,III.,yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention
245,III.,brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us
246,III.,must we in all things look for the how and the why and the wherefore
247,III.,daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest
248,III.,man is unjust but god is just and finally justice
249,III.,triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me
250,III.,when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal
251,III.,this was the old mans favorite tale and he loved to repeat it
252,III.,when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them
253,III.,once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember
254,III.,raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice
255,III.,stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand
256,III.,and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided
257,III.,over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people
258,III.,even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance
259,III.,having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them
260,III.,but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted
261,III.,might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty
262,III.,ruled with an iron rod  then it chanced in a noblemans palace
263,III.,that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion
264,III.,fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household
265,III.,she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold
266,III.,patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice
267,III.,as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended
268,III.,lo oer the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder
269,III.,smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand
270,III.,down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance
271,III.,and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie
272,III.,into whose claybuilt walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven
273,III.,silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith
274,III.,stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language
275,III.,all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors
276,III.,freeze in fantastic shapes on the windowpanes in the winter
277,III.,nutbrown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grandpré
278,III.,while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn
279,III.,wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties
280,III.,naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle
281,III.,orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed
282,III.,and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin
283,III.,then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table
284,III.,three times the old mans fee in solid pieces of silver
285,III.,and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom
286,III.,lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare
287,III.,wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed
288,III.,while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside
289,III.,soon was the game begun  in friendly contention the old men
290,III.,laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the kingrow
291,III.,meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a windows embrasure
292,III.,sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise
293,III.,over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows
294,III.,silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven
295,III.,thus passed the evening away  anon the bell from the belfry
296,III.,rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway
297,III.,rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household
298,III.,many a farewell word and sweet good night on the doorstep
299,III.,lingered long in evangelines heart and filled it with gladness
300,III.,carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearthstone
301,III.,and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer
302,III.,soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed
303,III.,up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness
304,III.,lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden
305,III.,silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber
306,III.,simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothespress
307,III.,ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded
308,III.,linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven
309,III.,this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage
310,III.,better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife
311,III.,soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight
312,III.,streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden
313,III.,swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean
314,III.,ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with
315,III.,naked snowwhite feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber
316,III.,little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard
317,III.,waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow
318,III.,yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness
319,III.,passed oer her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight
320,III.,flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment
321,III.,and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass
322,III.,forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps
323,III.,as out of abrahams tent young ishmael wandered with hagar
324,IV.,pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grandpré
325,IV.,pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas
326,IV.,where the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor
327,IV.,life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor
328,IV.,knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning
329,IV.,now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets
330,IV.,many a glad good morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk
331,IV.,made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows
332,IV.,where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward
333,IV.,group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway
334,IV.,long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced
335,IV.,thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the housedoors
336,IV.,sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together
337,IV.,every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted
338,IV.,for with this simple people who lived like brothers together
339,IV.,all things were held in common and what one had was anothers
340,IV.,bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness
341,IV.,fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it
342,IV.,under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard
343,IV.,bending with golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal
344,IV.,there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated
345,IV.,not far withdrawn from these by the ciderpress and the beehives
346,IV.,michael the fiddler was placed with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats
347,IV.,shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snowwhite
348,IV.,hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler
349,IV.,glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers
350,IV.,gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle
351,IV.,tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunkerque
352,IV.,and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music
353,IV.,under the orchardtrees and down the path to the meadows
354,IV.,old folk and young together and children mingled among them
355,IV.,noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith
356,IV.,so passed the morning away  and lo with a summons sonorous
357,IV.,sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat
358,IV.,thronged erelong was the church with men  without in the churchyard
359,IV.,waited the women  they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones
360,IV.,then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them
361,IV.,echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement
362,IV.,closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers
363,IV.,then uprose their commander and spake from the steps of the altar
364,IV.,holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission
365,IV.,you are convened this day he said by his majestys orders
366,IV.,clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness
367,IV.,let your own hearts reply  to my natural make and my temper
368,IV.,painful the task is i do which to you i know must be grievous
369,IV.,yet must i bow and obey and deliver the will of our monarch
370,IV.,namely that all your lands and dwellings and cattle of all kinds
371,IV.,forfeited be to the crown and that you yourselves from this province
372,IV.,be transported to other lands  god grant you may dwell there
373,IV.,prisoners now i declare you for such is his majestys pleasure
374,IV.,as when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer
375,IV.,suddenly gathers a storm and the deadly sling of the hailstones
376,IV.,beats down the farmers corn in the field and shatters his windows
377,IV.,hiding the sun and strewing the ground with thatch from the houseroofs
378,IV.,bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures
379,IV.,so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker
380,IV.,silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose
381,IV.,louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger
382,IV.,and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the doorway
383,IV.,vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations
384,IV.,rang through the house of prayer and high oer the heads of the others
385,IV.,rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith
386,IV.,as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows
387,IV.,flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted
388,IV.,down with the tyrants of england  we never have sworn them allegiance
389,IV.,death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests
390,IV.,more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier
391,IV.,smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement
392,IV.,in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention
393,IV.,lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician
394,IV.,entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar
395,IV.,raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence
396,IV.,all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people
397,IV.,deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful
398,IV.,spake he as after the tocsins alarum distinctly the clock strikes
399,IV.,what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you
400,IV.,forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you
401,IV.,not in word alone but in deed to love one another
402,IV.,is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations
403,IV.,have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness
404,IV.,this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it
405,IV.,lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you
406,IV.,see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion
407,IV.,hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them
408,IV.,let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us
409,IV.,let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them
410,IV.,few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people
411,IV.,sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak
412,IV.,and they repeated his prayer and said o father forgive them
413,IV.,then came the evening service  the tapers gleamed from the altar
414,IV.,fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded
415,IV.,not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria
416,IV.,sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated
417,IV.,rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven
418,IV.,meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides
419,IV.,wandered wailing from house to house the women and children
420,IV.,long at her fathers door evangeline stood with her right hand
421,IV.,shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending
422,IV.,lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each
423,IV.,long within had been spread the snowwhite cloth on the table
424,IV.,there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wildflowers
425,IV.,there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy
426,IV.,and at the head of the board the great armchair of the farmer
427,IV.,thus did evangeline wait at her fathers door as the sunset
428,IV.,threw the long shadows of trees oer the broad ambrosial meadows
429,IV.,ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen
430,IV.,and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended
431,IV.,cheering with looks and words the disconsolate hearts of the women
432,IV.,as oer the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed
433,IV.,urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children
434,IV.,down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors
435,IV.,veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai
436,IV.,sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded
437,IV.,all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows
438,IV.,stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion
439,IV.,gabriel cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer
440,IV.,came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living
441,IV.,slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father
442,IV.,smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board stood the supper untasted
443,IV.,empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror
444,IV.,sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber
445,IV.,in the dead of the night she heard the whispering rain fall
446,IV.,loud on the withered leaves of the sycamoretree by the window
447,IV.,keenly the lightning flashed and the voice of the echoing thunder
448,IV.,told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created
449,IV.,then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven
450,IV.,soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning
451,V.,four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day
452,V.,cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse
453,V.,soon oer the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession
454,V.,came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women
455,V.,driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the seashore
456,V.,pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings
457,V.,ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland
458,V.,close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen
459,V.,while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings
460,V.,thus to the gaspereaus mouth they hurried and there on the seabeach
461,V.,piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants
462,V.,all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply
463,V.,all day long the wains came laboring down from the village
464,V.,late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting
465,V.,echoed far oer the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard
466,V.,thither the women and children thronged  on a sudden the churchdoors
467,V.,opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession
468,V.,even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country
469,V.,sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn
470,V.,so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended
471,V.,down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters
472,V.,foremost the young men came and raising together their voices
473,V.,sang they with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions
474,V.,fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience
475,V.,then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside
476,V.,joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them
477,V.,not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction
478,V.,calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her
479,V.,and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion
480,V.,tears then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him
481,V.,clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered
482,V.,gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another
483,V.,nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen
484,V.,smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father
485,V.,saw she slowly advancing  alas how changed was his aspect
486,V.,gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep
487,V.,heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom
488,V.,but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him
489,V.,speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not
490,V.,thus to the gaspereaus mouth moved on that mournful procession
491,V.,there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking
492,V.,wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children
493,V.,left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties
494,V.,while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father
495,V.,half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight
496,V.,deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean
497,V.,fled away from the shore and left the line of the sandbeach
498,V.,covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery seaweed
499,V.,farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons
500,V.,like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle
501,V.,all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them
502,V.,inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors
503,V.,then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures
504,V.,sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders
505,V.,lowing they waited and long at the wellknown bars of the farmyard
506,V.,waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid
507,V.,silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded
508,V.,rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows
509,V.,but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled
510,V.,built of the driftwood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest
511,V.,round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered
512,V.,voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children
513,V.,onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish
514,V.,thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father
515,V.,and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man
516,V.,haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion
517,V.,een as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken
518,V.,vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him
519,V.,vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not
520,V.,but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering firelight
521,V.,more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents
522,V.,faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold
523,V.,hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow
524,V.,silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden
525,V.,raising his eyes full of tears to the silent stars that above them
526,V.,moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals
527,V.,then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence
528,V.,suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the bloodred
529,V.,moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and oer the horizon
530,V.,seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together
531,V.,broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village
532,V.,gleamed on the sky and the sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead
533,V.,columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were
534,V.,thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr
535,V.,then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting
536,V.,whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred housetops
537,V.,these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard
538,V.,speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish
539,V.,we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grandpré
540,V.,loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farmyards
541,V.,thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle
542,V.,came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted
543,V.,then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments
544,V.,far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska
545,V.,when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind
546,V.,or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river
547,V.,such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses
548,V.,broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed oer the meadows
549,V.,overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden
550,V.,gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them
551,V.,and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion
552,V.,lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the seashore
553,V.,motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed
554,V.,slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden
555,V.,knelt at her fathers side and wailed aloud in her terror
556,V.,then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom
557,V.,through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber
558,V.,and when she woke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her
559,V.,faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her
560,V.,still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape
561,V.,reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her
562,V.,and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses
563,V.,then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people
564,V.,let us bury him here by the sea  when a happier season
565,V.,brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile
566,V.,then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard
567,V.,such were the words of the priest  and there in haste by the seaside
568,V.,having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches
569,V.,but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grandpré
570,V.,and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow
571,V.,lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation
572,V.,solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges
573,V.,twas the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean
574,V.,with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward
575,V.,then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking
576,V.,and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor
577,V.,leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins
578,I.,many a weary year had passed since the burning of grandpré
579,I.,bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile
580,I.,exile without an end and without an example in story
581,I.,scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast
582,I.,strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland
583,I.,from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas
584,I.,from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters
585,I.,seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean
586,I.,deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth
587,I.,asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside
588,I.,written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards
589,I.,long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered
590,I.,lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things
591,I.,fair was she and young but alas before her extended
592,I.,dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway
593,I.,marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her
594,I.,as the emigrants way oer the western desert is marked by
595,I.,campfires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine
596,I.,as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine
597,I.,into the east again from whence it late had arisen
598,I.,sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her
599,I.,urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit
600,I.,sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones
601,I.,sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom
602,I.,he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him
603,I.,came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward
604,I.,sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him
605,I.,but it was long ago in some faroff place or forgotten
606,I.,gabriel lajeunesse they said o yes we have seen him
607,I.,he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies
608,I.,gabriel lajeunesse said others o yes we have seen him
609,I.,then would they say dear child why dream and wait for him longer
610,I.,are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others
611,I.,who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal
612,I.,here is baptiste leblanc the notarys son who has loved thee
613,I.,many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy
614,I.,thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherines tresses
615,I.,whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere
616,I.,for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway
617,I.,many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness
618,I.,said with a smile o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee
619,I.,if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning
620,I.,back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment
621,I.,that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain
622,I.,sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike
623,I.,therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike
624,I.,cheered by the good mans words evangeline labored and waited
625,I.,still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean
626,I.,but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered despair not
627,I.,thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort
628,I.,let me essay o muse to follow the wanderers footsteps
629,I.,not through each devious path each changeful year of existence
630,I.,but as a traveller follows a streamlets course through the valley
631,I.,far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water
632,I.,here and there in some open space and at intervals only
633,I.,then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it
634,I.,though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur
635,I.,happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet
636,II.,it was the month of may  far down the beautiful river
637,II.,past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash
638,II.,into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi
639,II.,floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen
640,II.,it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked
641,II.,bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune
642,II.,men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay
643,II.,sought for their kith and their kin among the fewacred farmers
644,II.,on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas
645,II.,with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician
646,II.,onward oer sunken sands through a wilderness somber with forests
647,II.,night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders
648,II.,cottontrees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current
649,II.,lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin
650,II.,level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river
651,II.,where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron
652,II.,sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward
653,II.,they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine
654,II.,soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters
655,II.,which like a network of steel extended in every direction
656,II.,over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress
657,II.,met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in midair
658,II.,waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals
659,II.,deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons
660,II.,home to their roosts in the cedartrees returning at sunset
661,II.,or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter
662,II.,lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water
663,II.,gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches
664,II.,down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin
665,II.,dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them
666,II.,and oer their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness
667,II.,strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed
668,II.,as at the tramp of a horses hoof on the turf of the prairies
669,II.,far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa
670,II.,so at the hoofbeats of fate with sad forebodings of evil
671,II.,shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it
672,II.,but evangelines heart was sustained by a vision that faintly
673,II.,floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight
674,II.,it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom
675,II.,and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer
676,II.,then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen
677,II.,and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure
678,II.,sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle
679,II.,wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang
680,II.,breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest
681,II.,soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music
682,II.,but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness
683,II.,and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence
684,II.,then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight
685,II.,such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers
686,II.,and through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert
687,II.,mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator
688,II.,thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them
689,II.,lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya
690,II.,made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus
691,II.,lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen
692,II.,faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms
693,II.,and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands
694,II.,near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber
695,II.,soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended
696,II.,under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin
697,II.,safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward
698,II.,over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar
699,II.,swinging from its great arms the trumpetflower and the grapevine
700,II.,hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob
701,II.,were the swift hummingbirds that flitted from blossom to blossom
702,II.,such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it
703,II.,filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven
704,II.,lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial
705,II.,darted a light swift boat that sped away oer the water
706,II.,urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers
707,II.,northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver
708,II.,at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn
709,II.,dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness
710,II.,somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written
711,II.,gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless
712,II.,sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow
713,II.,swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island
714,II.,but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos
715,II.,so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows
716,II.,and undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers
717,II.,angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden
718,II.,swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie
719,II.,after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance
720,II.,as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden
721,II.,said with a sigh to the friendly priest o father felician
722,II.,something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders
723,II.,is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition
724,II.,or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit
725,II.,then with a blush she added alas for my credulous fancy
726,II.,unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning
727,II.,but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered
728,II.,daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning
729,II.,feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface
730,II.,is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden
731,II.,therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions
732,II.,gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward
733,II.,on the banks of the têche are the towns of st maur and st martin
734,II.,there the longwandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom
735,II.,there the longabsent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold
736,II.,beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruittrees
737,II.,under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens
738,II.,bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest
739,II.,they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana
740,II.,with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey
741,II.,softly the evening came  the sun from the western horizon
742,II.,like a magician extended his golden wand oer the landscape
743,II.,seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together
744,II.,hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver
745,II.,floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water
746,II.,touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling
747,II.,glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her
748,II.,then from a neighboring thicket the mockingbird wildest of singers
749,II.,swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung oer the water
750,II.,shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music
751,II.,that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen
752,II.,plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness
753,II.,seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes
754,II.,till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision
755,II.,as when after a storm a gust of wind through the tree tops
756,II.,shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches
757,II.,with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion
758,II.,slowly they entered the têche where it flows through the green opelousas
759,II.,and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland
760,II.,saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling
761,II.,sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle
762,III.,near to the bank of the river oershadowed by oaks from whose branches
763,III.,such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yuletide
764,III.,stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman  a garden
765,III.,girdled it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms
766,III.,filling the air with fragrance  the house itself was of timbers
767,III.,large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported
768,III.,haunt of the hummingbird and the bee extended around it
769,III.,at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden
770,III.,silence reigned oer the place  the line of shadow and sunshine
771,III.,ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow
772,III.,into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose
773,III.,in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway
774,III.,through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie
775,III.,into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending
776,III.,full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas
777,III.,hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics
778,III.,stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines
779,III.,just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie
780,III.,sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin
781,III.,broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero
782,III.,gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master
783,III.,round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing
784,III.,that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape
785,III.,slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding
786,III.,fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded
787,III.,wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening
788,III.,suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle
789,III.,rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean
790,III.,silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed oer the prairie
791,III.,and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance
792,III.,then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden
793,III.,saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him
794,III.,suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward
795,III.,when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith
796,III.,hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden
797,III.,there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer
798,III.,gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces
799,III.,laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful
800,III.,thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings
801,III.,broke the silence and said if you came by the atchafalaya
802,III.,how have you nowhere encountered my gabriels boat on the bayous
803,III.,over evangelines face at the words of basil a shade passed
804,III.,tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent
805,III.,gone is gabriel gone and concealing her face on his shoulder
806,III.,all her oerburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented
807,III.,then the good basil saidand his voice grew blithe as he said it
808,III.,be of good cheer my child it is only today he departed
809,III.,foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses
810,III.,moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit
811,III.,could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence
812,III.,ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles
813,III.,he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens
814,III.,tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him
815,III.,unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards
816,III.,thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains
817,III.,hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver
818,III.,therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover
819,III.,he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him
820,III.,up and away tomorrow and through the red dew of the morning
821,III.,we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison
822,III.,then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river
823,III.,borne aloft on his comrades arms came michael the fiddler
824,III.,long under basils roof had he lived like a god on olympus
825,III.,far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle
826,III.,as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway
827,III.,kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured
828,III.,much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith
829,III.,all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor
830,III.,much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate
831,III.,and of the prairies whose numberless herds were his who would take them
832,III.,each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise
833,III.,thus they ascended the steps and crossing the airy veranda
834,III.,entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil
835,III.,waited his late return and they rested and feasted together
836,III.,all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver
837,III.,fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors
838,III.,brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight
839,III.,then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman
840,III.,poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion
841,III.,lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco
842,III.,thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened
843,III.,welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless
844,III.,welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one
845,III.,here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers
846,III.,here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer
847,III.,smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water
848,III.,all the year round the orangegroves are in blossom and grass grows
849,III.,more in a single night than a whole canadian summer
850,III.,here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies
851,III.,here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber
852,III.,with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses
853,III.,after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests
854,III.,no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads
855,III.,burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle
856,III.,speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils
857,III.,while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table
858,III.,so that the guests all started and father felician astounded
859,III.,suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff halfway to his nostrils
860,III.,but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer
861,III.,only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever
862,III.,for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate
863,III.,cured by wearing a spider hung round ones neck in a nutshell
864,III.,then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching
865,III.,sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda
866,III.,who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman
867,III.,friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were as strangers
868,III.,meeting in exile became straightway as friends to each other
869,III.,drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together
870,III.,but in the neighboring hall a strain of music proceeding
871,III.,all things forgotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening
872,III.,whirl of the dizzy dance as it swept and swayed to the music
873,III.,dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments
874,III.,meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman
875,III.,olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music
876,III.,heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness
877,III.,came oer her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden
878,III.,beautiful was the night  behind the black wall of the forest
879,III.,tipping its summit with silver arose the moon  on the river
880,III.,fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight
881,III.,like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit
882,III.,nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden
883,III.,poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions
884,III.,unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian
885,III.,fuller of fragrance than they and as heavy with shadows and nightdews
886,III.,hung the heart of the maiden  the calm and the magical moonlight
887,III.,as through the garden gate beneath the shade of the oaktrees
888,III.,passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie
889,III.,silent it lay with a silvery haze upon it and the fireflies
890,III.,over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens
891,III.,shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship
892,III.,save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple
893,III.,as if a hand had appeared and written upon them upharsin
894,III.,and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fireflies
895,III.,wandered alone and she cried o gabriel  o my beloved
896,III.,art thou so near unto me and yet i cannot behold thee
897,III.,art thou so near unto me and yet thy voice does not reach me
898,III.,ah how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie
899,III.,ah how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me
900,III.,thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers
901,III.,when shall these eyes behold these arms be folded about thee
902,III.,loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded
903,III.,like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets
904,III.,farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence
905,III.,bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden
906,III.,bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses
907,III.,with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal
908,III.,farewell said the priest as he stood at the shadowy threshold
909,III.,see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine
910,III.,and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming
911,III.,down to the rivers brink where the boatmen already were waiting
912,III.,thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness
913,III.,swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them
914,III.,blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert
915,III.,not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded
916,III.,found they trace of his course in lake or forest or river
917,III.,nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain
918,III.,rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country
919,III.,till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes
920,III.,weary and worn they alighted and learned from the garrulous landlord
921,III.,that on the day before with horses and guides and companions
922,III.,gabriel left the village and took the road of the prairies
923,IV.,far in the west there lies a desert land where the mountains
924,IV.,down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway
925,IV.,opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrants wagon
926,IV.,and to the south from fontainequibout and the spanish sierras
927,IV.,fretted with sands and rocks and swept by the wind of the desert
928,IV.,like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations
929,IV.,billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine
930,IV.,over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck
931,IV.,over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses
932,IV.,fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel
933,IV.,staining the desert with blood and above their terrible wartrails
934,IV.,like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle
935,IV.,here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders
936,IV.,here and there rise groves from the margins of swiftrunning rivers
937,IV.,and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert
938,IV.,climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brookside
939,IV.,and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven
940,IV.,into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains
941,IV.,gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him
942,IV.,day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil
943,IV.,followed his flying steps and thought each day to oertake him
944,IV.,sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his campfire
945,IV.,rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall
946,IV.,when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes
947,IV.,and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary
948,IV.,hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana
949,IV.,showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them
950,IV.,once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered
951,IV.,wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow
952,IV.,she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people
953,IV.,touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome
954,IV.,gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them
955,IV.,on the buffalomeat and the venison cooked on the embers
956,IV.,but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions
957,IV.,worn with the long days march and the chase of the deer and the bison
958,IV.,stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering firelight
959,IV.,flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets
960,IV.,then at the door of evangelines tent she sat and repeated
961,IV.,slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent
962,IV.,all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses
963,IV.,much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another
964,IV.,hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed
965,IV.,moved to the depths of her soul by pity and womans compassion
966,IV.,yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her
967,IV.,she in turn related her love and all its disasters
968,IV.,mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended
969,IV.,still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror
970,IV.,passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis
971,IV.,mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden
972,IV.,but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam
973,IV.,till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest
974,IV.,then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation
975,IV.,told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom
976,IV.,that through the pines oer her fathers lodge in the hush of the twilight
977,IV.,breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden
978,IV.,till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest
979,IV.,and never more returned nor was seen again by her people
980,IV.,to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her
981,IV.,seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress
982,IV.,slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose
983,IV.,touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland
984,IV.,with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches
985,IV.,filled with the thoughts of love was evangelines heart but a secret
986,IV.,as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow
987,IV.,it was no earthly fear  a breath from the region of spirits
988,IV.,seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment
989,IV.,that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom
990,IV.,with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished
991,IV.,early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee
992,IV.,said as they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains
993,IV.,dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission
994,IV.,much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus
995,IV.,loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him
996,IV.,let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us
997,IV.,thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains
998,IV.,just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices
999,IV.,and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river
1000,IV.,saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission
1001,IV.,under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village
1002,IV.,knelt the black robe chief with his children  a crucifix fastened
1003,IV.,high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines
1004,IV.,looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it
1005,IV.,this was their rural chapel  aloft through the intricate arches
1006,IV.,of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers
1007,IV.,mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches
1008,IV.,knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions
1009,IV.,but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen
1010,IV.,forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower
1011,IV.,slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them
1012,IV.,welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression
1013,IV.,hearing the homelike sounds of his mothertongue in the forest
1014,IV.,and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam
1015,IV.,there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maizeear
1016,IV.,feasted and slaked their thirst from the watergourd of the teacher
1017,IV.,soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered
1018,IV.,not six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated
1019,IV.,on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes
1020,IV.,told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey
1021,IV.,soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness
1022,IV.,but on evangelines heart fell his words as in winter the snowflakes
1023,IV.,fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed
1024,IV.,far to the north he has gone continued the priest but in autumn
1025,IV.,when the chase is done will return again to the mission
1026,IV.,then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive
1027,IV.,let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted
1028,IV.,so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow
1029,IV.,mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions
1030,IV.,days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing
1031,IV.,green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her
1032,IV.,then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens
1033,IV.,blushed at each bloodred ear for that betokened a lover
1034,IV.,but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield
1035,IV.,even the bloodred ear to evangeline brought not her lover
1036,IV.,patience the priest would say have faith and thy prayer will be answered
1037,IV.,look at this delicate plant that lifts its head from the meadow
1038,IV.,see how its leaves all point to the north as true as the magnet
1039,IV.,this is the compassflower that the finger of god has suspended
1040,IV.,here on its fragile stock to direct the travellers journey
1041,IV.,such in the soul of man is faith  the blossoms of passion
1042,IV.,gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance
1043,IV.,but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly
1044,IV.,only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter
1045,IV.,crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe
1046,IV.,so came the autumn and passed and the winteryet gabriel came not
1047,IV.,blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird
1048,IV.,sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not
1049,IV.,but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted
1050,IV.,sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom
1051,IV.,far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests
1052,IV.,gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river
1053,IV.,and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence
1054,IV.,she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests
1055,IV.,found she the hunters lodge deserted and fallen to ruin
1056,IV.,thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places
1057,IV.,now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions
1058,IV.,now in the noisy camps and the battlefields of the army
1059,IV.,fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey
1060,IV.,faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended
1061,IV.,leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow
1062,IV.,then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray oer her forehead
1063,IV.,dawn of another life that broke oer her earthly horizon
1064,IV.,as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning
1065,V.,in that delightful land which is washed by the delawares waters
1066,V.,guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle
1067,V.,stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded
1068,V.,there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty
1069,V.,and the streets still reecho the names of the trees of the forest
1070,V.,as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested
1071,V.,there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile
1072,V.,finding among the children of penn a home and a country
1073,V.,there old rené leblanc had died and when he departed
1074,V.,saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants
1075,V.,something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city
1076,V.,something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger
1077,V.,and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers
1078,V.,where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters
1079,V.,thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps
1080,V.,as from a mountains top the rainy mists of the morning
1081,V.,roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us
1082,V.,so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her
1083,V.,dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway
1084,V.,which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance
1085,V.,gabriel was not forgotten  within her heart was his image
1086,V.,clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him
1087,V.,only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence
1088,V.,into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not
1089,V.,over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured
1090,V.,he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent
1091,V.,this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her
1092,V.,so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices
1093,V.,suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma
1094,V.,other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow
1095,V.,meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour
1096,V.,thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting
1097,V.,lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city
1098,V.,night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated
1099,V.,loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city
1100,V.,high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper
1101,V.,day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs
1102,V.,plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market
1103,V.,met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings
1104,V.,then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city
1105,V.,presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons
1106,V.,darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn
1107,V.,and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september
1108,V.,flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow
1109,V.,spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence
1110,V.,wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor
1111,V.,but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger
1112,V.,only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants
1113,V.,crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless
1114,V.,then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands
1115,V.,now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket
1116,V.,meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seem to echo
1117,V.,softly the words of the lordthe poor ye always have with you
1118,V.,thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy  the dying
1119,V.,looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there
1120,V.,such as the artist paints oer the brows of saints and apostles
1121,V.,or such as hangs by night oer a city seen at a distance
1122,V.,unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial
1123,V.,thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent
1124,V.,wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse
1125,V.,sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden
1126,V.,and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them
1127,V.,that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty
1128,V.,then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind
1129,V.,distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church
1130,V.,sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco
1131,V.,soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit
1132,V.,something within her said at length thy trials are ended
1133,V.,and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness
1134,V.,moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence
1135,V.,closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces
1136,V.,where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside
1137,V.,turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence
1138,V.,fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison
1139,V.,and as she looked around she saw how death the consoler
1140,V.,laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever
1141,V.,suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder
1142,V.,still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder
1143,V.,ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers
1144,V.,and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning
1145,V.,then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish
1146,V.,that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows
1147,V.,on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man
1148,V.,long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples
1149,V.,but as he lay in the morning light his face for a moment
1150,V.,seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood
1151,V.,so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying
1152,V.,hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever
1153,V.,as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals
1154,V.,that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over
1155,V.,seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness
1156,V.,heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded
1157,V.,then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood
1158,V.,village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow
1159,V.,as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision
1160,V.,tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids
1161,V.,vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside
1162,V.,vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered
1163,V.,died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken
1164,V.,vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him
1165,V.,kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom
1166,V.,sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness
1167,V.,as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement
1168,V.,all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow
1169,V.,all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience
1170,V.,and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom
1171,V.,meekly she bowed her own and murmured father i thank thee
1172,V.,still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow
1173,V.,side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping
1174,V.,in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed
1175,V.,daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them
1176,V.,thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever
1177,V.,thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy
1178,V.,thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors
1179,V.,thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey
1180,V.,still stands the forest primeval but under the shade of its branches
1181,V.,only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic
1182,V.,wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom
1183,V.,in the fishermans cot the wheel and the loom are still busy
1184,V.,maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun
1185,V.,speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest
