60,I,in the acadian land on the shores of the basin of minas
62,I,lay in the fruitful valley  vast meadows stretched to the eastward
63,I,giving the village its name and pasture to flocks without number
64,I,dikes that the hands of the farmers had raised with labor incessant
65,I,shut out the turbulent tides but at stated seasons the floodgates
66,I,opened and welcomed the sea to wander at will oer the meadows
67,I,west and south there were fields of flax and orchards and cornfields
68,I,spreading afar and unfenced oer the plain and away to the northward
69,I,blomidon rose and the forests old and aloft on the mountains
70,I,seafogs pitched their tents and mists from the mighty atlantic
71,I,looked on the happy valley but neer from their station descended
72,I,there in the midst of its farms reposed the acadian village
73,I,strongly built were the houses with frames of oak and of chestnut
74,I,such as the peasants of normandy built in the reign of the henries
77,I,there in the tranquil evenings of summer when brightly the sunset
78,I,lighted the village street and gilded the vanes on the chimneys
79,I,matrons and maidens sat in snowwhite caps and in kirtles
80,I,scarlet and blue and green with distaffs spinning the golden
81,I,flax for the gossiping looms whose noisy shuttles within doors
82,I,mingled their sound with the whir of the wheels and the songs of the maidens
83,I,solemnly down the street came the parish priest and the children
84,I,paused in their play to kiss the hand he extended to bless them
85,I,reverend walked he among them and up rose matrons and maidens
87,I,then came the laborers home from the field and serenely the sun sank
88,I,down to his rest and twilight prevailed  anon from the belfry
89,I,softly the angelus sounded and over the roofs of the village
90,I,columns of pale blue smoke like clouds of incense ascending
91,I,rose from a hundred hearths the homes of peace and contentment
93,I,dwelt in the love of god and of man  alike were they free from
94,I,fear that reigns with the tyrant and envy the vice of republics
95,I,neither locks had they to their doors nor bars to their windows
96,I,but their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of the owners
97,I,there the richest was poor and the poorest lived in abundance
99,I,somewhat apart from the village and nearer the basin of minas
101,I,dwelt on his goodly acres and with him directing his household
102,I,gentle evangeline lived his child and the pride of the village
103,I,stalworth and stately in form was the man of seventy winters
104,I,hearty and hale was he an oak that is covered with snowflakes
105,I,white as the snow were his locks and his cheeks as brown as the oakleaves
106,I,fair was she to behold that maiden of seventeen summers
107,I,black were her eyes as the berry that grows on the thorn by the wayside
108,I,black yet how softly they gleamed beneath the brown shade of her tresses
109,I,sweet was her breath as the breath of kine that feed in the meadows
110,I,when in the harvest heat she bore to the reapers at noontide
111,I,flagons of homebrewed ale ah fair in sooth was the maiden
112,I,fairer was she when on sunday morn while the bell from its turret
113,I,sprinkled with holy sounds the air as the priest with his hyssop
115,I,down the long street she passed with her chaplet of beads and her missal
116,I,wearing her norman cap and her kirtle of blue and the earrings
117,I,brought in the olden time from france and since as an heirloom
120,I,shone on her face and encircled her form when after confession
122,I,when she had passed it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music
124,I,firmly builded with rafters of oak the house of the farmer
125,I,stood on the side of a hill commanding the sea and a shady
126,I,sycamore grew by the door with a woodbine wreathing around it
127,I,rudely carved was the porch with seats beneath and a footpath
128,I,led through an orchard wide and disappeared in the meadow
130,I,such as the traveller sees in regions remote by the roadside
131,I,built oer a box for the poor or the blessed image of mary
132,I,farther down on the slope of the hill was the well with its mossgrown
133,I,bucket fastened with iron and near it a trough for the horses
134,I,shielding the house from storms on the north were the barns and the farmyard
135,I,there stood the broadwheeled wains and the antique ploughs and the harrows
136,I,there were the folds for the sheep and there in his feathered seraglio
137,I,strutted the lordly turkey and crowed the cock with the selfsame
138,I,voice that in ages of old had startled the penitent peter
139,I,bursting with hay were the barns themselves a village  in each one
140,I,far oer the gable projected a roof of thatch and a staircase
141,I,under the sheltering eaves led up to the odorous cornloft
142,I,there too the dovecot stood with its meek and innocent inmates
143,I,murmuring ever of love while above in the variant breezes
146,I,thus at peace with god and the world the farmer of grandpr√©
147,I,lived on his sunny farm and evangeline governed his household
148,I,many a youth as he knelt in the church and opened his missal
149,I,fixed his eyes upon her as the saint of his deepest devotion
150,I,happy was he who might touch her hand or the hem of her garment
151,I,many a suitor came to her door by the darkness befriended
152,I,and as he knocked and waited to hear the sound of her footsteps
153,I,knew not which beat the louder his heart or the knocker of iron
154,I,or at the joyous feast of the patron saint of the village
155,I,bolder grew and pressed her hand in the dance as he whispered
156,I,hurried words of love that seemed a part of the music
157,I,but among all who came young gabriel only was welcome
159,I,who was a mighty man in the village and honored of all men
160,I,for since the birth of time throughout all ages and nations
161,I,has the craft of the smith been held in repute by the people
163,I,grew up together as brother and sister and father felician
164,I,priest and pedagogue both in the village had taught them their letters
165,I,out of the selfsame book with the hymns of the church and the plainsong
166,I,but when the hymn was sung and the daily lesson completed
167,I,swiftly they hurried away to the forge of basil the blacksmith
168,I,there at the door they stood with wondering eyes to behold him
169,I,take in his leathern lap the hoof of the horse as a plaything
170,I,nailing the shoe in its place while near him the tire of the cartwheel
171,I,lay like a fiery snake coiled round in a circle of cinders
172,I,oft on autumnal eves when without in the gathering darkness
173,I,bursting with light seemed the smithy through every cranny and crevice
174,I,warm by the forge within they watched the laboring bellows
175,I,and as its panting ceased and the sparks expired in the ashes
176,I,merrily laughed and said they were nuns going into the chapel
177,I,oft on sledges in winter as swift as the swoop of the eagle
178,I,down the hillside bounding they glided away oer the meadow
179,I,oft in the barns they climbed to the populous nests on the rafters
180,I,seeking with eager eyes that wondrous stone which the swallow
181,I,brings from the shore of the sea to restore the sight of its fledglings
182,I,lucky was he who found that stone in the nest of the swallow
183,I,thus passed a few swift years and they no longer were children
184,I,he was a valiant youth and his face like the face of the morning
185,I,gladdened the earth with its light and ripened through into action
186,I,she was a woman now with the heart and hopes of a woman
187,I,sunshine of saint eulalie was she called for that was the sunshine
188,I,which as the farmers believed would load their orchards with apples
189,I,she too would bring to her husbands house delight and abundance
190,I,filling it full of love and the ruddy faces of children
197,II.,now had the season returned when the nights grow colder and longer
198,II.,and the retreating sun the sign of the scorpion enters
199,II.,birds of passage sailed through the leaden air from the icebound
201,II.,harvests were gathered in and wild with the winds of september
202,II.,wrestled the trees of the forest as jacob of old with the angel
204,II.,bees with prophetic instinct of want had hoarded their honey
206,II.,cold would the winter be for thick was the fur of the foxes
207,II.,such was the advent of autumn  then followed that beautiful season
208,II.,called by the pious acadian peasants the summer of allsaints
209,II.,filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light and the landscape
210,II.,lay as if newcreated in all the freshness of childhood
211,II.,peace seemed to reign upon earth and the restless heart of the ocean
212,II.,was for a moment consoled  all sounds were in harmony blended
213,II.,voices of children at play the crowing of cocks in the farmyards
214,II.,whir of wings in the drowsy air and the cooing of pigeons
215,II.,all were subdued and low as the murmurs of love and the great sun
216,II.,looked with the eye of love through the golden vapors around him
217,II.,while arrayed in its robes of russet and scarlet and yellow
218,II.,bright with the sheen of the dew each glittering tree of the forest
219,II.,flashed like the planetree the persian adorned with mantles and jewels
221,II.,now recommenced the reign of rest and affection and stillness
222,II.,day with its burden and heat had departed and twilight descending
223,II.,brought back the evening star to the sky and the herds to the homestead
224,II.,pawing the ground they came and resting their necks on each other
225,II.,and with their nostrils distended inhaling the freshness of evening
227,II.,proud of her snowwhite hide and the ribbon that waved from her collar
228,II.,quietly paced and slow as if conscious of human affection
229,II.,then came the shepherd back with his bleating flocks from the seaside
230,II.,where was their favorite pasture  behind them followed the watchdog
231,II.,patient full of importance and grand in the pride of his instinct
232,II.,walking from side to side with a lordly air and superbly
234,II.,regent of flocks was he when the shepherd slept their protector
235,II.,when from the forest at night through the starry silence the wolves howled
236,II.,late with the rising moon returned the wains from the marshes
237,II.,laden with briny hay that filled the air with its odor
238,II.,cheerily neighed the steeds with dew on their manes and their fetlocks
239,II.,while aloft on their shoulders the wooden and ponderous saddles
240,II.,painted with brilliant dyes and adorned with tassels of crimson
243,II.,unto the milkmaids hand whilst loud and in regular cadence
245,II.,lowing of cattle and peals of laughter were heard in the farmyard
246,II.,echoed back by the barns  anon they sank into stillness
247,II.,heavily closed with a jarring sound the valves of the barndoors
248,II.,rattled the wooden bars and all for a season was silent
251,II.,sat in his elbowchair and watched how the flames and the smokewreaths
252,II.,struggled together like foe in a burning city  behind him
254,II.,darted his own huge shadow and vanished away into darkness
255,II.,faces clumsily carved in oak on the back of his armchair
256,II.,laughed in the flickering light and the pewter plates on the dresser
257,II.,caught and reflected the flame as shields of armies the sunshine
258,II.,fragments of song the old man sang and carols of christmas
259,II.,such as at home in the olden time his fathers before him
261,II.,close at her fathers side was the gentle evangeline seated
262,II.,spinning flax for the loom that stood in the corner behind her
263,II.,silent awhile were its treadles at rest was its diligent shuttle
264,II.,while the monotonous drone of the wheel like the drone of a bagpipe
265,II.,followed the old mans song and united the fragments together
266,II.,as in a church when the chant of the choir at intervals ceases
267,II.,footfalls are heard in the aisles or words of the priest at the altar
268,II.,so in each pause of the song with measured motion the clock clicked
270,II.,thus as they sat there were footsteps heard and suddenly lifted
271,II.,sounded the wooden latch and the door swung back on its hinges
272,II.,benedict knew by the hobnailed shoes it was basil the blacksmith
273,II.,and by her beating heart evangeline knew who was with him
274,II.,welcome the farmer exclaimed as their footsteps paused on the threshold
275,II.,welcome basil my friend  come take thy place on the settle
276,II.,close by the chimneyside which is always empty without thee
277,II.,take from the shelf overhead thy pipe and the box of tobacco
278,II.,never so much thyself art thou as when through the curling
279,II.,smoke of the pipe or the forge thy friendly and jovial face gleams
280,II.,round and red as the harvest moon through the mist of the marshes
281,II.,then with a smile of content thus answered basil the blacksmith
282,II.,taking with easy air the accustomed seat by the fireside
283,II.,benedict bellefontaine thou hast ever thy jest and thy ballad
284,II.,ever in cheerfullest mood art thou when others are filled with
285,II.,gloomy forebodings of ill and see only ruin before them
286,II.,happy art thou as if every day thou hadst picked up a horseshoe
287,II.,pausing a moment to take the pipe that evangeline brought him
288,II.,and with a coal from the embers had lighted he slowly continued
289,II.,four days now are passed since the english ships at their anchors
290,II.,ride in the gaspereaus mouth with their cannon pointed against us
291,II.,what their design may be is unknown but all are commanded
292,II.,on the morrow to meet in the church where his majestys mandate
293,II.,will be proclaimed as law in the land  alas in the mean time
294,II.,many surmises of evil alarm the hearts of the people
296,II.,brings these ships to our shores  perhaps the harvests in england
298,II.,and from our bursting barns they would feed their cattle and children
299,II.,not so thinketh the folk in the village said warmly the blacksmith
300,II.,shaking his head as in doubt then heaving a sigh he continued
301,II.,louisburg is not forgotten nor beau s√©jour nor port royal
302,II.,many already have fled to the forest and lurk on its outskirts
304,II.,arms have been taken from us and warlike weapons of all kinds
305,II.,nothing is left but the blacksmiths sledge and the scythe of the mower
306,II.,then with a pleasant smile made answer the jovial farmer
307,II.,safer are we unarmed in the midst of our flocks and our cornfields
309,II.,than our fathers in forts besieged by the enemys cannon
310,II.,fear no evil my friend and tonight may no shadow of sorrow
311,II.,fall on this house and hearth for this is the night of the contract
312,II.,built are the house and the barn  the merry lads of the village
313,II.,strongly have built them and well and breaking the glebe round about them
314,II.,filled the barn with hay and the house with food for a twelvemonth
315,II.,ren√© leblanc will be here anon with his papers and inkhorn
316,II.,shall we not then be glad and rejoice in the joy of our children
317,II.,as apart by the window she stood with her hand in her lovers
318,II.,blushing evangeline heard the words that her father had spoken
319,II.,and as they died on his lips the worthy notary entered
326,III.,bent like a laboring oar that toils in the surf of the ocean
327,III.,bent but not broken by age was the form of the notary public
328,III.,shocks of yellow hair like the silken floss of the maize hung
329,III.,over his shoulders his forehead was high and glasses with horn bows
330,III.,sat astride on his nose with a look of wisdom supernal
331,III.,father of twenty children was he and more than a hundred
332,III.,childrens children rode on his knee and heard his great watch tick
333,III.,four long years in the times of the war had he languished a captive
334,III.,suffering much in an old french fort as the friend of the english
336,III.,ripe in wisdom was he but patient and simple and childlike
337,III.,he was beloved by all and most of all by the children
338,III.,for he told them tales of the loupgarou in the forest
339,III.,and of the goblin that came in the night to water the horses
340,III.,and of the white l√©tiche the ghost of a child who unchristened
341,III.,died and was doomed to haunt unseen the chambers of children
342,III.,and how on christmas eve the oxen talked in the stable
343,III.,and how the fever was cured by a spider shut up in a nutshell
344,III.,and of the marvellous powers of fourleaved clover and horseshoes
345,III.,with whatsoever else was writ in the lore of the village
346,III.,then up rose from his seat by the fireside basil the blacksmith
347,III.,knocked from his pipe the ashes and slowly extending his right hand
348,III.,father leblanc he exclaimed thou hast heard the talk in the village
349,III.,and perchance canst tell us some news of these ships and their errand
351,III.,gossip enough have i heard in sooth yet am never the wiser
352,III.,and what their errand may be i know not better than others
353,III.,yet am i not of those who imagine some evil intention
354,III.,brings them here for we are at peace and why then molest us
356,III.,must we in all things look for the how and the why and the wherefore
357,III.,daily injustice is done and might is the right of the strongest
359,III.,man is unjust but god is just and finally justice
360,III.,triumphs and well i remember a story that often consoled me
361,III.,when as a captive i lay in the old french fort at port royal
362,III.,this was the old mans favorite tale and he loved to repeat it
363,III.,when his neighbors complained that any injustice was done them
364,III.,once in an ancient city whose name i no longer remember
365,III.,raised aloft on a column a brazen statue of justice
366,III.,stood in the public square upholding the scales in its left hand
367,III.,and in its right a sword as an emblem that justice presided
368,III.,over the laws of the land and the hearts and homes of the people
369,III.,even the birds had built their nests in the scales of the balance
370,III.,having no fear of the sword that flashed in the sunshine above them
371,III.,but in the course of time the laws of the land were corrupted
372,III.,might took the place of right and the weak were oppressed and the mighty
373,III.,ruled with an iron rod  then it chanced in a noblemans palace
374,III.,that a necklace of pearls was lost and erelong a suspicion
375,III.,fell on an orphan girl who lived as maid in the household
376,III.,she after form of trial condemned to die on the scaffold
377,III.,patiently met her doom at the foot of the statue of justice
378,III.,as to her father in heaven her innocent spirit ascended
379,III.,lo oer the city a tempest rose and the bolts of the thunder
380,III.,smote the statue of bronze and hurled in wrath from its left hand
381,III.,down on the pavement below the clattering scales of the balance
382,III.,and in the hollow thereof was found the nest of a magpie
383,III.,into whose claybuilt walls the necklace of pearls was inwoven
384,III.,silenced but not convinced when the story was ended the blacksmith
385,III.,stood like a man who fain would speak but findeth no language
386,III.,all his thoughts were congealed into lines on his face as the vapors
387,III.,freeze in fantastic shapes on the windowpanes in the winter
391,III.,nutbrown ale that was famed for its strength in the village of grandpr√©
392,III.,while from his pocket the notary drew his papers and inkhorn
393,III.,wrote with a steady hand the date and the age of the parties
394,III.,naming the dower of the bride in flocks of sheep and in cattle
395,III.,orderly all things proceeded and duly and well were completed
396,III.,and the great seal of the law was set like a sun on the margin
397,III.,then from his leathern pouch the farmer threw on the table
398,III.,three times the old mans fee in solid pieces of silver
399,III.,and the notary rising and blessing the bride and the bridegroom
400,III.,lifted aloft the tankard of ale and drank to their welfare
401,III.,wiping the foam from his lip he solemnly bowed and departed
402,III.,while in silence the others sat and mused by the fireside
404,III.,soon was the game begun  in friendly contention the old men
406,III.,laughed when a man was crowned or a breach was made in the kingrow
407,III.,meanwhile apart in the twilight gloom of a windows embrasure
408,III.,sat the lovers and whispered together beholding the moon rise
409,III.,over the pallid sea and the silvery mist of the meadows
410,III.,silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven
413,III.,thus passed the evening away  anon the bell from the belfry
414,III.,rang out the hour of nine the village curfew and straightway
415,III.,rose the guests and departed and silence reigned in the household
416,III.,many a farewell word and sweet good night on the doorstep
417,III.,lingered long in evangelines heart and filled it with gladness
418,III.,carefully then were covered the embers that glowed on the hearthstone
419,III.,and on the oaken stairs resounded the tread of the farmer
420,III.,soon with a soundless step the foot of evangeline followed
421,III.,up the staircase moved a luminous space in the darkness
422,III.,lighted less by the lamp than the shining face of the maiden
423,III.,silent she passed the hall and entered the door of her chamber
424,III.,simple that chamber was with its curtains of white and its clothespress
425,III.,ample and high on whose spacious shelves were carefully folded
426,III.,linen and woollen stuffs by the hand of evangeline woven
427,III.,this was the precious dower she would bring to her husband in marriage
428,III.,better than flocks and herds being proofs of her skill as a housewife
429,III.,soon she extinguished her lamp for the mellow and radiant moonlight
430,III.,streamed through the windows and lighted the room till the heart of the maiden
431,III.,swelled and obeyed its power like the tremulous tides of the ocean
432,III.,ah she was fair exceeding fair to behold as she stood with
433,III.,naked snowwhite feet on the gleaming floor of her chamber
434,III.,little she dreamed that below among the trees of the orchard
435,III.,waited her lover and watched for the gleam of her lamp and her shadow
436,III.,yet were her thoughts of him and at times a feeling of sadness
437,III.,passed oer her soul as the sailing shade of clouds in the moonlight
438,III.,flitted across the floor and darkened the room for a moment
439,III.,and as she gazed from the window she saw serenely the moon pass
440,III.,forth from the folds of a cloud and one star follow her footsteps
441,III.,as out of abrahams tent young ishmael wandered with hagar
448,IV.,pleasantly rose next morn the sun on the village of grandpr√©
449,IV.,pleasantly gleamed in the soft sweet air the basin of minas
450,IV.,where the ships with their wavering shadows were riding at anchor
451,IV.,life had long been astir in the village and clamorous labor
452,IV.,knocked with its hundred hands at the golden gates of the morning
453,IV.,now from the country around from the farms and neighboring hamlets
455,IV.,many a glad good morrow and jocund laugh from the young folk
456,IV.,made the bright air brighter as up from the numerous meadows
457,IV.,where no path could be seen but the track of wheels in the greensward
458,IV.,group after group appeared and joined or passed on the highway
459,IV.,long ere noon in the village all sounds of labor were silenced
460,IV.,thronged were the streets with people and noisy groups at the housedoors
461,IV.,sat in the cheerful sun and rejoiced and gossiped together
462,IV.,every house was an inn where all were welcomed and feasted
463,IV.,for with this simple people who lived like brothers together
464,IV.,all things were held in common and what one had was anothers
467,IV.,bright was her face with smiles and words of welcome and gladness
468,IV.,fell from her beautiful lips and blessed the cup as she gave it
470,IV.,under the open sky in the odorous air of the orchard
471,IV.,bending with golden fruit was spread the feast of betrothal
472,IV.,there in the shade of the porch were the priest and the notary seated
474,IV.,not far withdrawn from these by the ciderpress and the beehives
475,IV.,michael the fiddler was placed with the gayest of hearts and of waistcoats
476,IV.,shadow and light from the leaves alternately played on his snowwhite
477,IV.,hair as it waved in the wind and the jolly face of the fiddler
478,IV.,glowed like a living coal when the ashes are blown from the embers
479,IV.,gayly the old man sang to the vibrant sound of his fiddle
480,IV.,tous les bourgeois de chartres and le carillon de dunkerque
481,IV.,and anon with his wooden shoes beat time to the music
483,IV.,under the orchardtrees and down the path to the meadows
484,IV.,old folk and young together and children mingled among them
486,IV.,noblest of all the youths was gabriel son of the blacksmith
488,IV.,so passed the morning away  and lo with a summons sonorous
489,IV.,sounded the bell from its tower and over the meadows a drum beat
490,IV.,thronged erelong was the church with men  without in the churchyard
491,IV.,waited the women  they stood by the graves and hung on the headstones
493,IV.,then came the guard from the ships and marching proudly among them
495,IV.,echoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement
497,IV.,closed and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers
498,IV.,then uprose their commander and spake from the steps of the altar
499,IV.,holding aloft in his hands with its seals the royal commission
500,IV.,you are convened this day he said by his majestys orders
501,IV.,clement and kind has he been but how you have answered his kindness
502,IV.,let your own hearts reply  to my natural make and my temper
503,IV.,painful the task is i do which to you i know must be grievous
504,IV.,yet must i bow and obey and deliver the will of our monarch
505,IV.,namely that all your lands and dwellings and cattle of all kinds
506,IV.,forfeited be to the crown and that you yourselves from this province
507,IV.,be transported to other lands  god grant you may dwell there
509,IV.,prisoners now i declare you for such is his majestys pleasure
510,IV.,as when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer
511,IV.,suddenly gathers a storm and the deadly sling of the hailstones
512,IV.,beats down the farmers corn in the field and shatters his windows
513,IV.,hiding the sun and strewing the ground with thatch from the houseroofs
514,IV.,bellowing fly the herds and seek to break their enclosures
515,IV.,so on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker
516,IV.,silent a moment they stood in speechless wonder and then rose
517,IV.,louder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger
518,IV.,and by one impulse moved they madly rushed to the doorway
519,IV.,vain was the hope of escape and cries and fierce imprecations
520,IV.,rang through the house of prayer and high oer the heads of the others
521,IV.,rose with his arms uplifted the figure of basil the blacksmith
522,IV.,as on a stormy sea a spar is tossed by the billows
523,IV.,flushed was his face and distorted with passion and wildly he shouted
524,IV.,down with the tyrants of england  we never have sworn them allegiance
525,IV.,death to these foreign soldiers who seize on our homes and our harvests
526,IV.,more he fain would have said but the merciless hand of a soldier
527,IV.,smote him upon the mouth and dragged him down to the pavement
529,IV.,in the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention
530,IV.,lo the door of the chancel opened and father felician
531,IV.,entered with serious mien and ascended the steps of the altar
532,IV.,raising his reverend hand with a gesture he awed into silence
533,IV.,all that clamorous throng and thus he spake to his people
534,IV.,deep were his tones and solemn in accents measured and mournful
535,IV.,spake he as after the tocsins alarum distinctly the clock strikes
536,IV.,what is this that ye do my children what madness has seized you
537,IV.,forty years of my life have i labored among you and taught you
538,IV.,not in word alone but in deed to love one another
539,IV.,is this the fruit of my toils of my vigils and prayers and privations
540,IV.,have you so soon forgotten all lessons of love and forgiveness
541,IV.,this is the house of the prince of peace and would you profane it
543,IV.,lo where the crucified christ from his cross is gazing upon you
544,IV.,see in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion
545,IV.,hark how those lips still repeat the prayer o father forgive them
546,IV.,let us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us
547,IV.,let us repeat it now and say o father forgive them
548,IV.,few were his words of rebuke but deep in the hearts of his people
549,IV.,sank they and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak
550,IV.,and they repeated his prayer and said o father forgive them
552,IV.,then came the evening service  the tapers gleamed from the altar
553,IV.,fervent and deep was the voice of the priest and the people responded
554,IV.,not with their lips alone but their hearts and the ave maria
555,IV.,sang they and fell on their knees and their souls with devotion translated
556,IV.,rose on the ardor of prayer like elijah ascending to heaven
558,IV.,meanwhile had spread in the village the tidings of ill and on all sides
559,IV.,wandered wailing from house to house the women and children
560,IV.,long at her fathers door evangeline stood with her right hand
561,IV.,shielding her eyes from the level rays of the sun that descending
562,IV.,lighted the village street with mysterious splendor and roofed each
564,IV.,long within had been spread the snowwhite cloth on the table
565,IV.,there stood the wheaten loaf and the honey fragrant with wildflowers
566,IV.,there stood the tankard of ale and the cheese fresh brought from the dairy
567,IV.,and at the head of the board the great armchair of the farmer
568,IV.,thus did evangeline wait at her fathers door as the sunset
569,IV.,threw the long shadows of trees oer the broad ambrosial meadows
570,IV.,ah on her spirit within a deeper shadow had fallen
571,IV.,and from the fields of her soul a fragrance celestial ascended
574,IV.,cheering with looks and words the disconsolate hearts of the women
575,IV.,as oer the darkening fields with lingering steps they departed
576,IV.,urged by their household cares and the weary feet of their children
577,IV.,down sank the great red sun and in golden glimmering vapors
578,IV.,veiled the light of his face like the prophet descending from sinai
579,IV.,sweetly over the village the bell of the angelus sounded
582,IV.,all was silent within and in vain at the door and the windows
583,IV.,stood she and listened and looked till overcome by emotion
584,IV.,gabriel cried she aloud with tremulous voice but no answer
585,IV.,came from the graves of the dead nor the gloomier grave of the living
586,IV.,slowly at length she returned to the tenantless house of her father
587,IV.,smouldered the fire on the hearth on the board stood the supper untasted
588,IV.,empty and drear was each room and haunted with phantoms of terror
589,IV.,sadly echoed her step on the stair and the floor of her chamber
590,IV.,in the dead of the night she heard the whispering rain fall
591,IV.,loud on the withered leaves of the sycamoretree by the window
592,IV.,keenly the lightning flashed and the voice of the echoing thunder
593,IV.,told her that god was in heaven and governed the world he created
594,IV.,then she remembered the tale she had heard of the justice of heaven
595,IV.,soothed was her troubled soul and she peacefully slumbered till morning
602,V.,four times the sun had risen and set and now on the fifth day
603,V.,cheerily called the cock to the sleeping maids of the farmhouse
604,V.,soon oer the yellow fields in silent and mournful procession
605,V.,came from the neighboring hamlets and farms the acadian women
606,V.,driving in ponderous wains their household goods to the seashore
607,V.,pausing and looking back to gaze once more on their dwellings
608,V.,ere they were shut from sight by the winding road and the woodland
609,V.,close at their sides their children ran and urged on the oxen
610,V.,while in their little hands they clasped some fragments of playthings
612,V.,thus to the gaspereaus mouth they hurried and there on the seabeach
613,V.,piled in confusion lay the household goods of the peasants
614,V.,all day long between the shore and the ships did the boats ply
615,V.,all day long the wains came laboring down from the village
616,V.,late in the afternoon when the sun was near to his setting
617,V.,echoed far oer the fields came the roll of drums from the churchyard
618,V.,thither the women and children thronged  on a sudden the churchdoors
619,V.,opened and forth came the guard and marching in gloomy procession
621,V.,even as pilgrims who journey afar from their homes and their country
622,V.,sing as they go and in singing forget they are weary and wayworn
623,V.,so with songs on their lips the acadian peasants descended
624,V.,down from the church to the shore amid their wives and their daughters
625,V.,foremost the young men came and raising together their voices
626,V.,sang they with tremulous lips a chant of the catholic missions
628,V.,fill our hearts this day with strength and submission and patience
629,V.,then the old men as they marched and the women that stood by the wayside
630,V.,joined in the sacred psalm and the birds in the sunshine above them
634,V.,not overcome with grief but strong in the hour of affliction
635,V.,calmly and sadly she waited until the procession approached her
636,V.,and she beheld the face of gabriel pale with emotion
637,V.,tears then filled her eyes and eagerly running to meet him
638,V.,clasped she his hands and laid her head on his shoulder and whispered
639,V.,gabriel be of good cheer for if we love one another
640,V.,nothing in truth can harm us whatever mischances may happen
641,V.,smiling she spake these words then suddenly paused for her father
642,V.,saw she slowly advancing  alas how changed was his aspect
643,V.,gone was the glow from his cheek and the fire from his eye and his footstep
644,V.,heavier seemed with the weight of the heavy heart in his bosom
645,V.,but with a smile and a sigh she clasped his neck and embraced him
646,V.,speaking words of endearment where words of comfort availed not
647,V.,thus to the gaspereaus mouth moved on that mournful procession
649,V.,there disorder prevailed and the tumult and stir of embarking
651,V.,wives were torn from their husbands and mothers too late saw their children
652,V.,left on the land extending their arms with wildest entreaties
654,V.,while in despair on the shore evangeline stood with her father
655,V.,half the task was not done when the sun went down and the twilight
656,V.,deepened and darkened around and in haste the refluent ocean
657,V.,fled away from the shore and left the line of the sandbeach
658,V.,covered with waifs of the tide with kelp and the slippery seaweed
659,V.,farther back in the midst of the household goods and the wagons
660,V.,like to a gypsy camp or a leaguer after a battle
661,V.,all escape cut off by the sea and the sentinels near them
665,V.,inland and far up the shore the stranded boats of the sailors
666,V.,then as the night descended the herds returned from their pastures
667,V.,sweet was the moist still air with the odor of milk from their udders
668,V.,lowing they waited and long at the wellknown bars of the farmyard
669,V.,waited and looked in vain for the voice and the hand of the milkmaid
670,V.,silence reigned in the streets from the church no angelus sounded
671,V.,rose no smoke from the roofs and gleamed no lights from the windows
673,V.,but on the shores meanwhile the evening fires had been kindled
674,V.,built of the driftwood thrown on the sands from wrecks in the tempest
675,V.,round them shapes of gloom and sorrowful faces were gathered
676,V.,voices of women were heard and of men and the crying of children
677,V.,onward from fire to fire as from hearth to hearth in his parish
680,V.,thus he approached the place where evangeline sat with her father
681,V.,and in the flickering light beheld the face of the old man
682,V.,haggard and hollow and wan and without either thought or emotion
683,V.,een as the face of a clock from which the hands have been taken
684,V.,vainly evangeline strove with words and caresses to cheer him
685,V.,vainly offered him food yet he moved not he looked not he spake not
686,V.,but with a vacant stare ever gazed at the flickering firelight
688,V.,more he fain would have said but his heart was full and his accents
689,V.,faltered and paused on his lips as the feet of a child on a threshold
690,V.,hushed by the scene he beholds and the awful presence of sorrow
691,V.,silently therefore he laid his hand on the head of the maiden
692,V.,raising his eyes full of tears to the silent stars that above them
693,V.,moved on their way unperturbed by the wrongs and sorrows of mortals
694,V.,then sat he down at her side and they wept together in silence
696,V.,suddenly rose from the south a light as in autumn the bloodred
697,V.,moon climbs the crystal walls of heaven and oer the horizon
699,V.,seizing the rocks and the rivers and piling huge shadows together
700,V.,broader and ever broader it gleamed on the roofs of the village
701,V.,gleamed on the sky and the sea and the ships that lay in the roadstead
702,V.,columns of shining smoke uprose and flashes of flame were
703,V.,thrust through their folds and withdrawn like the quivering hands of a martyr
704,V.,then as the wind seized the gleeds and the burning thatch and uplifting
705,V.,whirled them aloft through the air at once from a hundred housetops
708,V.,these things beheld in dismay the crowd on the shore and on shipboard
709,V.,speechless at first they stood then cried aloud in their anguish
710,V.,we shall behold no more our homes in the village of grandpr√©
711,V.,loud on a sudden the cocks began to crow in the farmyards
712,V.,thinking the day had dawned and anon the lowing of cattle
713,V.,came on the evening breeze by the barking of dogs interrupted
714,V.,then rose a sound of dread such as startles the sleeping encampments
715,V.,far in the western prairies or forests that skirt the nebraska
716,V.,when the wild horses affrighted sweep by with the speed of the whirlwind
717,V.,or the loud bellowing herds of buffaloes rush to the river
718,V.,such was the sound that arose on the night as the herds and the horses
719,V.,broke through their folds and fences and madly rushed oer the meadows
721,V.,overwhelmed with the sight yet speechless the priest and the maiden
722,V.,gazed on the scene of terror that reddened and widened before them
723,V.,and as they turned at length to speak to their silent companion
724,V.,lo from his seat he had fallen and stretched abroad on the seashore
725,V.,motionless lay his form from which the soul had departed
726,V.,slowly the priest uplifted the lifeless head and the maiden
727,V.,knelt at her fathers side and wailed aloud in her terror
728,V.,then in a swoon she sank and lay with her head on his bosom
729,V.,through the long night she lay in deep oblivious slumber
730,V.,and when she woke from the trance she beheld a multitude near her
731,V.,faces of friends she beheld that were mournfully gazing upon her
733,V.,still the blaze of the burning village illumined the landscape
734,V.,reddened the sky overhead and gleamed on the faces around her
735,V.,and like the day of doom it seemed to her wavering senses
736,V.,then a familiar voice she heard as it said to the people
737,V.,let us bury him here by the sea  when a happier season
738,V.,brings us again to our homes from the unknown land of our exile
739,V.,then shall his sacred dust be piously laid in the churchyard
740,V.,such were the words of the priest  and there in haste by the seaside
741,V.,having the glare of the burning village for funeral torches
742,V.,but without bell or book they buried the farmer of grandpr√©
743,V.,and as the voice of the priest repeated the service of sorrow
744,V.,lo with a mournful sound like the voice of a vast congregation
745,V.,solemnly answered the sea and mingled its roar with the dirges
746,V.,twas the returning tide that afar from the waste of the ocean
747,V.,with the first dawn of the day came heaving and hurrying landward
748,V.,then recommenced once more the stir and noise of embarking
749,V.,and with the ebb of the tide the ships sailed out of the harbor
750,V.,leaving behind them the dead on the shore and the village in ruins
764,I.,many a weary year had passed since the burning of grandpr√©
766,I.,bearing a nation with all its household gods into exile
767,I.,exile without an end and without an example in story
769,I.,scattered were they like flakes of snow when the wind from the northeast
770,I.,strikes aslant through the fogs that darken the banks of newfoundland
772,I.,from the cold lakes of the north to sultry southern savannas
773,I.,from the bleak shores of the sea to the lands where the father of waters
774,I.,seizes the hills in his hands and drags them down to the ocean
775,I.,deep in their sands to bury the scattered bones of the mammoth
777,I.,asked of the earth but a grave and no longer a friend nor a fireside
778,I.,written their history stands on tablets of stone in the churchyards
779,I.,long among them was seen a maiden who waited and wandered
780,I.,lowly and meek in spirit and patiently suffering all things
781,I.,fair was she and young but alas before her extended
782,I.,dreary and vast and silent the desert of life with its pathway
783,I.,marked by the graves of those who had sorrowed and suffered before her
785,I.,as the emigrants way oer the western desert is marked by
786,I.,campfires long consumed and bones that bleach in the sunshine
788,I.,as if a morning of june with all its music and sunshine
790,I.,into the east again from whence it late had arisen
791,I.,sometimes she lingered in towns till urged by the fever within her
792,I.,urged by a restless longing the hunger and thirst of the spirit
794,I.,sometimes in churchyards strayed and gazed on the crosses and tombstones
795,I.,sat by some nameless grave and thought that perhaps in its bosom
796,I.,he was already at rest and she longed to slumber beside him
798,I.,came with its airy hand to point and beckon her forward
799,I.,sometimes she spake with those who had seen her beloved and known him
800,I.,but it was long ago in some faroff place or forgotten
801,I.,gabriel lajeunesse they said o yes we have seen him
802,I.,he was with basil the blacksmith and both have gone to the prairies
804,I.,gabriel lajeunesse said others o yes we have seen him
806,I.,then would they say dear child why dream and wait for him longer
807,I.,are there not other youths as fair as gabriel others
808,I.,who have hearts as tender and true and spirits as loyal
809,I.,here is baptiste leblanc the notarys son who has loved thee
810,I.,many a tedious year come give him thy hand and be happy
811,I.,thou art too fair to be left to braid st catherines tresses
813,I.,whither my heart has gone there follows my hand and not elsewhere
814,I.,for when the heart goes before like a lamp and illumines the pathway
815,I.,many things are made clear that else lie hidden in darkness
817,I.,said with a smile o daughter thy god thus speaketh within thee
819,I.,if it enrich not the heart of another its waters returning
820,I.,back to their springs like the rain shall fill them full of refreshment
821,I.,that which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain
823,I.,sorrow and silence are strong and patient endurance is godlike
824,I.,therefore accomplish thy labor of love till the heart is made godlike
826,I.,cheered by the good mans words evangeline labored and waited
827,I.,still in her heart she heard the funeral dirge of the ocean
828,I.,but with its sound there was mingled a voice that whispered despair not
829,I.,thus did that poor soul wander in want and cheerless discomfort
831,I.,let me essay o muse to follow the wanderers footsteps
832,I.,not through each devious path each changeful year of existence
833,I.,but as a traveller follows a streamlets course through the valley
834,I.,far from its margin at times and seeing the gleam of its water
835,I.,here and there in some open space and at intervals only
836,I.,then drawing nearer its banks through sylvan glooms that conceal it
837,I.,though he behold it not he can hear its continuous murmur
838,I.,happy at length if he find the spot where it reaches an outlet
845,II.,it was the month of may  far down the beautiful river
846,II.,past the ohio shore and past the mouth of the wabash
847,II.,into the golden stream of the broad and swift mississippi
848,II.,floated a cumbrous boat that was rowed by acadian boatmen
849,II.,it was a band of exiles a raft as it were from the shipwrecked
851,II.,bound by the bonds of a common belief and a common misfortune
852,II.,men and women and children who guided by hope or by hearsay
853,II.,sought for their kith and their kin among the fewacred farmers
854,II.,on the acadian coast and the prairies of fair opelousas
855,II.,with them evangeline went and her guide the father felician
856,II.,onward oer sunken sands through a wilderness somber with forests
858,II.,night after night by their blazing fires encamped on its borders
860,II.,cottontrees nodded their shadowy crests they swept with the current
862,II.,lay in the stream and along the wimpling waves of their margin
864,II.,level the landscape grew and along the shores of the river
868,II.,where through the golden coast and groves of orange and citron
869,II.,sweeps with majestic curve the river away to the eastward
870,II.,they too swerved from their course and entering the bayou of plaquemine
871,II.,soon were lost in a maze of sluggish and devious waters
872,II.,which like a network of steel extended in every direction
873,II.,over their heads the towering and tenebrous boughs of the cypress
874,II.,met in a dusky arch and trailing mosses in midair
875,II.,waved like banners that hang on the walls of ancient cathedrals
876,II.,deathlike the silence seemed and unbroken save by the herons
877,II.,home to their roosts in the cedartrees returning at sunset
878,II.,or by the owl as he greeted the moon with demoniac laughter
879,II.,lovely the moonlight was as it glanced and gleamed on the water
880,II.,gleamed on the columns of cypress and cedar sustaining the arches
881,II.,down through whose broken vaults it fell as through chinks in a ruin
882,II.,dreamlike and indistinct and strange were all things around them
883,II.,and oer their spirits there came a feeling of wonder and sadness
884,II.,strange forebodings of ill unseen and that cannot be compassed
885,II.,as at the tramp of a horses hoof on the turf of the prairies
886,II.,far in advance are closed the leaves of the shrinking mimosa
887,II.,so at the hoofbeats of fate with sad forebodings of evil
888,II.,shrinks and closes the heart ere the stroke of doom has attained it
889,II.,but evangelines heart was sustained by a vision that faintly
890,II.,floated before her eyes and beckoned her on through the moonlight
891,II.,it was the thought of her brain that assumed the shape of a phantom
893,II.,and every stroke of the oar now brought him nearer and nearer
895,II.,then in his place at the prow of the boat rose one of the oarsmen
896,II.,and as a signal sound if others like them peradventure
897,II.,sailed on those gloomy and midnight streams blew a blast on his bugle
898,II.,wild through the dark colonnades and corridors leafy the blast rang
899,II.,breaking the seal of silence and giving tongues to the forest
900,II.,soundless above them the banners of moss just stirred to the music
903,II.,but not a voice replied no answer came from the darkness
904,II.,and when the echoes had ceased like a sense of pain was the silence
905,II.,then evangeline slept but the boatmen rowed through the midnight
907,II.,such as they sang of old on their own acadian rivers
908,II.,and through the night were heard the mysterious sounds of the desert
910,II.,mixed with the whoop of the crane and the roar of the grim alligator
912,II.,thus ere another noon they emerged from the shades and before them
913,II.,lay in the golden sun the lakes of the atchafalaya
915,II.,made by the passing oars and resplendent in beauty the lotus
916,II.,lifted her golden crown above the heads of the boatmen
917,II.,faint was the air with the odorous breath of magnolia blossoms
918,II.,and with the heat of noon and numberless sylvan islands
920,II.,near to whose shores they glided along invited to slumber
921,II.,soon by the fairest of these their weary oars were suspended
922,II.,under the boughs of wachita willows that grew by the margin
923,II.,safely their boat was moored and scattered about on the greensward
925,II.,over them vast and high extended the cope of a cedar
926,II.,swinging from its great arms the trumpetflower and the grapevine
927,II.,hung their ladder of ropes aloft like the ladder of jacob
929,II.,were the swift hummingbirds that flitted from blossom to blossom
930,II.,such was the vision evangeline saw as she slumbered beneath it
931,II.,filled was her heart with love and the dawn of an opening heaven
932,II.,lighted her soul in sleep with the glory of regions celestial
935,II.,darted a light swift boat that sped away oer the water
936,II.,urged on its course by the sinewy arms of hunters and trappers
937,II.,northward its prow was turned to the land of the bison and beaver
938,II.,at the helm sat a youth with countenance thoughtful and careworn
939,II.,dark and neglected locks overshadowed his brow and a sadness
940,II.,somewhat beyond his years on his face was legibly written
941,II.,gabriel was it who weary with waiting unhappy and restless
942,II.,sought in the western wilds oblivion of self and of sorrow
943,II.,swiftly they glided along close under the lee of the island
944,II.,but by the opposite bank and behind a screen of palmettos
945,II.,so that they saw not the boat where it lay concealed in the willows
946,II.,and undisturbed by the dash of their oars and unseen were the sleepers
947,II.,angel of god was there none to awaken the slumbering maiden
948,II.,swiftly they glided away like the shade of a cloud on the prairie
949,II.,after the sound of their oars on the tholes had died in the distance
950,II.,as from a magic trance the sleepers awoke and the maiden
951,II.,said with a sigh to the friendly priest o father felician
952,II.,something says in my heart that near me gabriel wanders
953,II.,is it a foolish dream an idle and vague superstition
954,II.,or has an angel passed and revealed the truth to my spirit
955,II.,then with a blush she added alas for my credulous fancy
956,II.,unto ears like thine such words as these have no meaning
957,II.,but made answer the reverend man and he smiled as he answered
958,II.,daughter thy words are not idle nor are they to me without meaning
959,II.,feeling is deep and still and the word that floats on the surface
960,II.,is as the tossing buoy that betrays where the anchor is hidden
961,II.,therefore trust to thy heart and to what the world calls illusions
962,II.,gabriel truly is near thee for not far away to the southward
963,II.,on the banks of the t√™che are the towns of st maur and st martin
964,II.,there the longwandering bride shall be given again to her bridegroom
965,II.,there the longabsent pastor regain his flock and his sheepfold
966,II.,beautiful is the land with its prairies and forests of fruittrees
967,II.,under the feet a garden of flowers and the bluest of heavens
968,II.,bending above and resting its dome on the walls of the forest
969,II.,they who dwell there have named it the eden of louisiana
971,II.,with these words of cheer they arose and continued their journey
972,II.,softly the evening came  the sun from the western horizon
973,II.,like a magician extended his golden wand oer the landscape
975,II.,seemed all on fire at the touch and melted and mingled together
976,II.,hanging between two skies a cloud with edges of silver
977,II.,floated the boat with its dripping oars on the motionless water
979,II.,touched by the magic spell the sacred fountains of feeling
980,II.,glowed with the light of love as the skies and waters around her
981,II.,then from a neighboring thicket the mockingbird wildest of singers
982,II.,swinging aloft on a willow spray that hung oer the water
983,II.,shook from his little throat such floods of delirious music
984,II.,that the whole air and the woods and the waves seemed silent to listen
985,II.,plaintive at first were the tones and sad then soaring to madness
986,II.,seemed they to follow or guide the revel of frenzied bacchantes
988,II.,till having gathered them all he flung them abroad in derision
989,II.,as when after a storm a gust of wind through the tree tops
990,II.,shakes down the rattling rain in a crystal shower on the branches
991,II.,with such a prelude as this and hearts that throbbed with emotion
992,II.,slowly they entered the t√™che where it flows through the green opelousas
993,II.,and through the amber air above the crest of the woodland
994,II.,saw the column of smoke that arose from a neighboring dwelling
995,II.,sounds of a horn they heard and the distant lowing of cattle
1002,III.,near to the bank of the river oershadowed by oaks from whose branches
1004,III.,such as the druids cut down with golden hatchets at yuletide
1005,III.,stood secluded and still the house of the herdsman  a garden
1006,III.,girdled it round about with a belt of luxuriant blossoms
1007,III.,filling the air with fragrance  the house itself was of timbers
1009,III.,large and low was the roof and on slender columns supported
1011,III.,haunt of the hummingbird and the bee extended around it
1012,III.,at each end of the house amid the flowers of the garden
1015,III.,silence reigned oer the place  the line of shadow and sunshine
1016,III.,ran near the tops of the trees but the house itself was in shadow
1018,III.,into the evening air a thin blue column of smoke rose
1019,III.,in the rear of the house from the garden gate ran a pathway
1020,III.,through the great groves of oak to the skirts of the limitless prairie
1021,III.,into whose sea of flowers the sun was slowly descending
1022,III.,full in his track of light like ships with shadowy canvas
1023,III.,hanging loose from their spars in a motionless calm in the tropics
1024,III.,stood a cluster of trees with tangled cordage of grapevines
1026,III.,just where the woodlands met the flowery surf of the prairie
1028,III.,sat a herdsman arrayed in gaiters and doublet of deerskin
1029,III.,broad and brown was the face that from under the spanish sombrero
1030,III.,gazed on the peaceful scene with the lordly look of its master
1031,III.,round about him were numberless herds of kine that were grazing
1033,III.,that uprose from the river and spread itself over the landscape
1034,III.,slowly lifting the horn that hung at his side and expanding
1035,III.,fully his broad deep chest he blew a blast that resounded
1036,III.,wildly and sweet and far through the still damp air of the evening
1037,III.,suddenly out of the grass the long white horns of the cattle
1038,III.,rose like flakes of foam on the adverse currents of ocean
1039,III.,silent a moment they gazed then bellowing rushed oer the prairie
1040,III.,and the whole mass became a cloud a shade in the distance
1041,III.,then as the herdsman turned to the house through the gate of the garden
1042,III.,saw he the forms of the priest and the maiden advancing to meet him
1043,III.,suddenly down from his horse he sprang in amazement and forward
1045,III.,when they beheld his face they recognized basil the blacksmith
1046,III.,hearty his welcome was as he led his guests to the garden
1047,III.,there in an arbor of roses with endless question and answer
1048,III.,gave they vent to their hearts and renewed their friendly embraces
1049,III.,laughing and weeping by turns or sitting silent and thoughtful
1050,III.,thoughtful for gabriel came not and now dark doubts and misgivings
1052,III.,broke the silence and said if you came by the atchafalaya
1053,III.,how have you nowhere encountered my gabriels boat on the bayous
1054,III.,over evangelines face at the words of basil a shade passed
1055,III.,tears came into her eyes and she said with a tremulous accent
1056,III.,gone is gabriel gone and concealing her face on his shoulder
1057,III.,all her oerburdened heart gave way and she wept and lamented
1058,III.,then the good basil saidand his voice grew blithe as he said it
1059,III.,be of good cheer my child it is only today he departed
1060,III.,foolish boy he has left me alone with my herds and my horses
1061,III.,moody and restless grown and tried and troubled his spirit
1062,III.,could no longer endure the calm of this quiet existence
1064,III.,ever silent or speaking only of thee and his troubles
1065,III.,he at length had become so tedious to men and to maidens
1066,III.,tedious even to me that at length i bethought me and sent him
1067,III.,unto the town of adayes to trade for mules with the spaniards
1068,III.,thence he will follow the indian trails to the ozark mountains
1069,III.,hunting for furs in the forests on rivers trapping the beaver
1070,III.,therefore be of good cheer we will follow the fugitive lover
1071,III.,he is not far on his way and the fates and the streams are against him
1072,III.,up and away tomorrow and through the red dew of the morning
1073,III.,we will follow him fast and bring him back to his prison
1075,III.,then glad voices were heard and up from the banks of the river
1076,III.,borne aloft on his comrades arms came michael the fiddler
1077,III.,long under basils roof had he lived like a god on olympus
1079,III.,far renowned was he for his silver locks and his fiddle
1081,III.,as they bore him aloft in triumphal procession and straightway
1083,III.,kindly and oft and recalling the past while basil enraptured
1086,III.,much they marvelled to see the wealth of the cidevant blacksmith
1087,III.,all his domains and his herds and his patriarchal demeanor
1088,III.,much they marvelled to hear his tales of the soil and the climate
1089,III.,and of the prairies whose numberless herds were his who would take them
1090,III.,each one thought in his heart that he too would go and do likewise
1091,III.,thus they ascended the steps and crossing the airy veranda
1092,III.,entered the hall of the house where already the supper of basil
1093,III.,waited his late return and they rested and feasted together
1096,III.,all was silent without and illuming the landscape with silver
1097,III.,fair rose the dewy moon and the myriad stars but within doors
1098,III.,brighter than these shone the faces of friends in the glimmering lamplight
1099,III.,then from his station aloft at the head of the table the herdsman
1100,III.,poured forth his heart and his wine together in endless profusion
1101,III.,lighting his pipe that was filled with sweet natchitoches tobacco
1102,III.,thus he spake to his guests who listened and smiled as they listened
1103,III.,welcome once more my friends who long have been friendless and homeless
1104,III.,welcome once more to a home that is better perchance than the old one
1105,III.,here no hungry winter congeals our blood like the rivers
1106,III.,here no stony ground provokes the wrath of the farmer
1107,III.,smoothly the ploughshare runs through the soil as a keel through the water
1108,III.,all the year round the orangegroves are in blossom and grass grows
1109,III.,more in a single night than a whole canadian summer
1110,III.,here too numberless herds run wild and unclaimed in the prairies
1111,III.,here too lands may be had for the asking and forests of timber
1112,III.,with a few blows of the axe are hewn and framed into houses
1113,III.,after your houses are built and your fields are yellow with harvests
1114,III.,no king george of england shall drive you away from your homesteads
1115,III.,burning your dwellings and barns and stealing your farms and your cattle
1116,III.,speaking these words he blew a wrathful cloud from his nostrils
1117,III.,while his huge brown hand came thundering down on the table
1118,III.,so that the guests all started and father felician astounded
1119,III.,suddenly paused with a pinch of snuff halfway to his nostrils
1120,III.,but the brave basil resumed and his words were milder and gayer
1121,III.,only beware of the fever my friends beware of the fever
1122,III.,for it is not like that of our cold acadian climate
1123,III.,cured by wearing a spider hung round ones neck in a nutshell
1124,III.,then there were voices heard at the door and footsteps approaching
1125,III.,sounded upon the stairs and the floor of the breezy veranda
1127,III.,who had been summoned all to the house of basil the herdsman
1129,III.,friend clasped friend in his arms and they who before were as strangers
1130,III.,meeting in exile became straightway as friends to each other
1131,III.,drawn by the gentle bond of a common country together
1132,III.,but in the neighboring hall a strain of music proceeding
1135,III.,all things forgotten beside they gave themselves to the maddening
1136,III.,whirl of the dizzy dance as it swept and swayed to the music
1137,III.,dreamlike with beaming eyes and the rush of fluttering garments
1139,III.,meanwhile apart at the head of the hall the priest and the herdsman
1142,III.,olden memories rose and loud in the midst of the music
1143,III.,heard she the sound of the sea and an irrepressible sadness
1144,III.,came oer her heart and unseen she stole forth into the garden
1145,III.,beautiful was the night  behind the black wall of the forest
1146,III.,tipping its summit with silver arose the moon  on the river
1147,III.,fell here and there through the branches a tremulous gleam of the moonlight
1148,III.,like the sweet thoughts of love on a darkened and devious spirit
1149,III.,nearer and round about her the manifold flowers of the garden
1150,III.,poured out their souls in odors that were their prayers and confessions
1151,III.,unto the night as it went its way like a silent carthusian
1152,III.,fuller of fragrance than they and as heavy with shadows and nightdews
1153,III.,hung the heart of the maiden  the calm and the magical moonlight
1155,III.,as through the garden gate beneath the shade of the oaktrees
1156,III.,passed she along the path to the edge of the measureless prairie
1157,III.,silent it lay with a silvery haze upon it and the fireflies
1159,III.,over her head the stars the thoughts of god in the heavens
1160,III.,shone on the eyes of man who had ceased to marvel and worship
1161,III.,save when a blazing comet was seen on the walls of that temple
1162,III.,as if a hand had appeared and written upon them upharsin
1163,III.,and the soul of the maiden between the stars and the fireflies
1164,III.,wandered alone and she cried o gabriel  o my beloved
1165,III.,art thou so near unto me and yet i cannot behold thee
1166,III.,art thou so near unto me and yet thy voice does not reach me
1167,III.,ah how often thy feet have trod this path to the prairie
1168,III.,ah how often thine eyes have looked on the woodlands around me
1170,III.,thou hast lain down to rest and to dream of me in thy slumbers
1171,III.,when shall these eyes behold these arms be folded about thee
1172,III.,loud and sudden and near the note of a whippoorwill sounded
1173,III.,like a flute in the woods and anon through the neighboring thickets
1174,III.,farther and farther away it floated and dropped into silence
1178,III.,bright rose the sun next day and all the flowers of the garden
1179,III.,bathed his shining feet with their tears and anointed his tresses
1180,III.,with the delicious balm that they bore in their vases of crystal
1181,III.,farewell said the priest as he stood at the shadowy threshold
1182,III.,see that you bring us the prodigal son from his fasting and famine
1183,III.,and too the foolish virgin who slept when the bridegroom was coming
1185,III.,down to the rivers brink where the boatmen already were waiting
1186,III.,thus beginning their journey with morning and sunshine and gladness
1187,III.,swiftly they followed the flight of him who was speeding before them
1188,III.,blown by the blast of fate like a dead leaf over the desert
1189,III.,not that day nor the next nor yet the day that succeeded
1190,III.,found they trace of his course in lake or forest or river
1191,III.,nor after many days had they found him but vague and uncertain
1192,III.,rumors alone were their guides through a wild and desolate country
1193,III.,till at the little inn of the spanish town of adayes
1194,III.,weary and worn they alighted and learned from the garrulous landlord
1195,III.,that on the day before with horses and guides and companions
1196,III.,gabriel left the village and took the road of the prairies
1203,IV.,far in the west there lies a desert land where the mountains
1205,IV.,down from their jagged deep ravines where the gorge like a gateway
1206,IV.,opens a passage rude to the wheels of the emigrants wagon
1210,IV.,and to the south from fontainequibout and the spanish sierras
1211,IV.,fretted with sands and rocks and swept by the wind of the desert
1213,IV.,like the great chords of a harp in loud and solemn vibrations
1215,IV.,billowy bays of grass ever rolling in shadow and sunshine
1217,IV.,over them wandered the buffalo herds and the elk and the roebuck
1218,IV.,over them wandered the wolves and herds of riderless horses
1219,IV.,fires that blast and blight and winds that are weary with travel
1221,IV.,staining the desert with blood and above their terrible wartrails
1223,IV.,like the implacable soul of a chieftain slaughtered in battle
1225,IV.,here and there rise smokes from the camps of these savage marauders
1226,IV.,here and there rise groves from the margins of swiftrunning rivers
1227,IV.,and the grim taciturn bear the anchorite monk of the desert
1228,IV.,climbs down their dark ravines to dig for roots by the brookside
1229,IV.,and over all is the sky the clear and crystalline heaven
1232,IV.,into this wonderful land at the base of the ozark mountains
1233,IV.,gabriel far had entered with hunters and trappers behind him
1234,IV.,day after day with their indian guides the maiden and basil
1235,IV.,followed his flying steps and thought each day to oertake him
1236,IV.,sometimes they saw or thought they saw the smoke of his campfire
1237,IV.,rise in the morning air from the distant plain but at nightfall
1238,IV.,when they had reached the place they found only embers and ashes
1239,IV.,and though their hearts were sad at times and their bodies were weary
1240,IV.,hope still guided them on as the magic fata morgana
1241,IV.,showed them her lakes of light that retreated and vanished before them
1243,IV.,once as they sat by their evening fire there silently entered
1245,IV.,wore deep traces of sorrow and patience as great as her sorrow
1246,IV.,she was a shawnee woman returning home to her people
1249,IV.,touched were their hearts at her story and warmest and friendliest welcome
1250,IV.,gave they with words of cheer and she sat and feasted among them
1251,IV.,on the buffalomeat and the venison cooked on the embers
1252,IV.,but when their meal was done and basil and all his companions
1253,IV.,worn with the long days march and the chase of the deer and the bison
1254,IV.,stretched themselves on the ground and slept where the quivering firelight
1255,IV.,flashed on their swarthy cheeks and their forms wrapped up in their blankets
1256,IV.,then at the door of evangelines tent she sat and repeated
1257,IV.,slowly with soft low voice and the charm of her indian accent
1258,IV.,all the tale of her love with its pleasures and pains and reverses
1259,IV.,much evangeline wept at the tale and to know that another
1260,IV.,hapless heart like her own had loved and had been disappointed
1261,IV.,moved to the depths of her soul by pity and womans compassion
1262,IV.,yet in her sorrow pleased that one who had suffered was near her
1263,IV.,she in turn related her love and all its disasters
1264,IV.,mute with wonder the shawnee sat and when she had ended
1265,IV.,still was mute but at length as if a mysterious horror
1266,IV.,passed through her brain she spake and repeated the tale of the mowis
1267,IV.,mowis the bridegroom of snow who won and wedded a maiden
1268,IV.,but when the morning came arose and passed from the wigwam
1270,IV.,till she beheld him no more though she followed far into the forest
1271,IV.,then in those sweet low tones that seemed like a weird incantation
1272,IV.,told she the tale of the fair lilinau who was wooed by a phantom
1273,IV.,that through the pines oer her fathers lodge in the hush of the twilight
1274,IV.,breathed like the evening wind and whispered love to the maiden
1275,IV.,till she followed his green and waving plume through the forest
1276,IV.,and never more returned nor was seen again by her people
1278,IV.,to the soft flow of her magical words till the region around her
1279,IV.,seemed like enchanted ground and her swarthy guest the enchantress
1280,IV.,slowly over the tops of the ozark mountains the moon rose
1282,IV.,touching the sombre leaves and embracing and filling the woodland
1283,IV.,with a delicious sound the brook rushed by and the branches
1285,IV.,filled with the thoughts of love was evangelines heart but a secret
1287,IV.,as the cold poisonous snake creeps into the nest of the swallow
1288,IV.,it was no earthly fear  a breath from the region of spirits
1289,IV.,seemed to float in the air of night and she felt for a moment
1290,IV.,that like the indian maid she too was pursuing a phantom
1291,IV.,with this thought she slept and the fear and the phantom had vanished
1293,IV.,early upon the morrow the march was resumed and the shawnee
1294,IV.,said as they journeyed along on the western slope of these mountains
1295,IV.,dwells in his little village the black robe chief of the mission
1296,IV.,much he teaches the people and tells them of mary and jesus
1297,IV.,loud laugh their hearts with joy and weep with pain as they hear him
1299,IV.,let us go to the mission for there good tidings await us
1300,IV.,thither they turned their steeds and behind a spur of the mountains
1301,IV.,just as the sun went down they heard a murmur of voices
1302,IV.,and in a meadow green and broad by the bank of a river
1303,IV.,saw the tents of the christians the tents of the jesuit mission
1304,IV.,under a towering oak that stood in the midst of the village
1305,IV.,knelt the black robe chief with his children  a crucifix fastened
1306,IV.,high on the trunk of the tree and overshadowed by grapevines
1307,IV.,looked with its agonized face on the multitude kneeling beneath it
1308,IV.,this was their rural chapel  aloft through the intricate arches
1309,IV.,of its aerial roof arose the chant of their vespers
1310,IV.,mingling its notes with the soft susurrus and sighs of the branches
1312,IV.,knelt on the swarded floor and joined in the evening devotions
1313,IV.,but when the service was done and the benediction had fallen
1314,IV.,forth from the hands of the priest like seed from the hands of the sower
1315,IV.,slowly the reverend man advanced to the strangers and bade them
1316,IV.,welcome and when they replied he smiled with benignant expression
1317,IV.,hearing the homelike sounds of his mothertongue in the forest
1318,IV.,and with words of kindness conducted them into his wigwam
1319,IV.,there upon mats and skins they reposed and on cakes of the maizeear
1320,IV.,feasted and slaked their thirst from the watergourd of the teacher
1321,IV.,soon was their story told and the priest with solemnity answered
1322,IV.,not six suns have risen and set since gabriel seated
1323,IV.,on this mat by my side where now the maiden reposes
1324,IV.,told me this same sad tale then arose and continued his journey
1325,IV.,soft was the voice of the priest and he spake with an accent of kindness
1326,IV.,but on evangelines heart fell his words as in winter the snowflakes
1327,IV.,fall into some lone nest from which the birds have departed
1328,IV.,far to the north he has gone continued the priest but in autumn
1329,IV.,when the chase is done will return again to the mission
1330,IV.,then evangeline said and her voice was meek and submissive
1331,IV.,let me remain with thee for my soul is sad and afflicted
1332,IV.,so seemed it wise and well unto all and betimes on the morrow
1333,IV.,mounting his mexican steed with his indian guides and companions
1337,IV.,days and weeks and months and the fields of maize that were springing
1338,IV.,green from the ground when a stranger she came now waving above her
1341,IV.,then in the golden weather the maize was husked and the maidens
1342,IV.,blushed at each bloodred ear for that betokened a lover
1343,IV.,but at the crooked laughed and called it a thief in the cornfield
1344,IV.,even the bloodred ear to evangeline brought not her lover
1345,IV.,patience the priest would say have faith and thy prayer will be answered
1346,IV.,look at this delicate plant that lifts its head from the meadow
1347,IV.,see how its leaves all point to the north as true as the magnet
1348,IV.,this is the compassflower that the finger of god has suspended
1349,IV.,here on its fragile stock to direct the travellers journey
1351,IV.,such in the soul of man is faith  the blossoms of passion
1352,IV.,gay and luxuriant flowers are brighter and fuller of fragrance
1353,IV.,but they beguile us and lead us astray and their odor is deadly
1354,IV.,only this humble plant can guide us here and hereafter
1355,IV.,crown us with asphodel flowers that are wet with the dews of nepenthe
1357,IV.,so came the autumn and passed and the winteryet gabriel came not
1358,IV.,blossomed the opening spring and the notes of the robin and bluebird
1359,IV.,sounded sweet upon wold and in wood yet gabriel came not
1360,IV.,but on the breath of the summer winds a rumor was wafted
1361,IV.,sweeter than song of bird or hue or odor of blossom
1362,IV.,far to the north and east it said in the michigan forests
1363,IV.,gabriel had his lodge by the banks of the saginaw river
1364,IV.,and with returning guides that sought the lakes of st lawrence
1367,IV.,she had attained at length the depths of the michigan forests
1368,IV.,found she the hunters lodge deserted and fallen to ruin
1370,IV.,thus did the long sad years glide on and in seasons and places
1372,IV.,now in the tents of grace of the meek moravian missions
1373,IV.,now in the noisy camps and the battlefields of the army
1376,IV.,fair was she and young when in hope began the long journey
1377,IV.,faded was she and old when in disappointment it ended
1379,IV.,leaving behind it broader and deeper the gloom and the shadow
1380,IV.,then there appeared and spread faint streaks of gray oer her forehead
1381,IV.,dawn of another life that broke oer her earthly horizon
1382,IV.,as in the eastern sky the first faint streaks of the morning
1389,V.,in that delightful land which is washed by the delawares waters
1390,V.,guarding in sylvan shades the name of penn the apostle
1391,V.,stands on the banks of its beautiful stream the city he founded
1392,V.,there all the air is balm and the peach is the emblem of beauty
1393,V.,and the streets still reecho the names of the trees of the forest
1394,V.,as if they fain would appease the dryads whose haunts they molested
1395,V.,there from the troubled sea had evangeline landed an exile
1396,V.,finding among the children of penn a home and a country
1397,V.,there old ren√© leblanc had died and when he departed
1398,V.,saw at his side only one of all his hundred descendants
1399,V.,something at least there was in the friendly streets of the city
1400,V.,something that spake to her heart and made her no longer a stranger
1401,V.,and her ear was pleased with the thee and thou of the quakers
1403,V.,where all men were equal and all were brothers and sisters
1406,V.,thither as leaves to the light were turned her thoughts and her footsteps
1407,V.,as from a mountains top the rainy mists of the morning
1408,V.,roll away and afar we behold the landscape below us
1410,V.,so fell the mists from her mind and she saw the world far below her
1411,V.,dark no longer but all illumined with love and the pathway
1412,V.,which she had climbed so far lying smooth and fair in the distance
1413,V.,gabriel was not forgotten  within her heart was his image
1414,V.,clothed in the beauty of love and youth as last she beheld him
1415,V.,only more beautiful made by his deathlike silence and absence
1416,V.,into her thoughts of him time entered not for it was not
1417,V.,over him years had no power he was not changed but transfigured
1418,V.,he had become to her heart as one who is dead and not absent
1420,V.,this was the lesson a life of trial and sorrow had taught her
1421,V.,so was her love diffused but like to some odorous spices
1422,V.,suffered no waste nor loss though filling the air with aroma
1423,V.,other hope had she none nor wish in life but to follow
1424,V.,meekly with reverent steps the sacred feet of her saviour
1425,V.,thus many years she lived as a sister of mercy frequenting
1426,V.,lonely and wretched roofs in the crowded lanes of the city
1429,V.,night after night when the world was asleep as the watchman repeated
1430,V.,loud through the gusty streets that all was well in the city
1431,V.,high at some lonely window he saw the light of her taper
1432,V.,day after day in the gray of the dawn as slow through the suburbs
1433,V.,plodded the german farmer with flowers and fruits for the market
1434,V.,met he that meek pale face returning home from its watchings
1436,V.,then it came to pass that a pestilence fell on the city
1437,V.,presaged by wondrous signs and mostly by flocks of wild pigeons
1438,V.,darkening the sun in their flight with naught in their craws but an acorn
1439,V.,and as the tides of the sea arise in the month of september
1440,V.,flooding some silver stream till it spreads to a lake in the meadow
1442,V.,spread to a brackish lake the silver stream of existence
1443,V.,wealth had no power to bribe nor beauty to charm the oppressor
1444,V.,but all perished alike beneath the scourge of his anger
1445,V.,only alas the poor who had neither friends nor attendants
1446,V.,crept away to die in the almshouse home of the homeless
1447,V.,then in the suburbs it stood in the midst of meadows and woodlands
1448,V.,now the city surrounds it but still with its gateway and wicket
1449,V.,meek in the midst of splendor its humble walls seem to echo
1450,V.,softly the words of the lordthe poor ye always have with you
1451,V.,thither by night and by day came the sister of mercy  the dying
1452,V.,looked up into her face and thought indeed to behold there
1454,V.,such as the artist paints oer the brows of saints and apostles
1455,V.,or such as hangs by night oer a city seen at a distance
1456,V.,unto their eyes it seemed the lamps of the city celestial
1459,V.,thus on a sabbath morn through the streets deserted and silent
1460,V.,wending her quiet way she entered the door of the almshouse
1461,V.,sweet on the summer air was the odor of flowers in the garden
1462,V.,and she paused on her way to gather the fairest among them
1463,V.,that the dying once more might rejoice in their fragrance and beauty
1464,V.,then as she mounted the stairs to the corridors cooled by the east wind
1465,V.,distant and soft on her ear fell the chimes from the belfry of christ church
1467,V.,sounds of psalms that were sung by the swedes in their church at wicaco
1468,V.,soft as descending wings fell the calm of the hour on her spirit
1469,V.,something within her said at length thy trials are ended
1470,V.,and with light in her looks she entered the chambers of sickness
1472,V.,moistening the feverish lip and the aching brow and in silence
1473,V.,closing the sightless eyes of the dead and concealing their faces
1474,V.,where on their pallets they lay like drifts of snow by the roadside
1476,V.,turned on its pillow of pain to gaze while she passed for her presence
1477,V.,fell on their hearts like a ray of the sun on the walls of a prison
1478,V.,and as she looked around she saw how death the consoler
1479,V.,laying his hand upon many a heart had healed it forever
1483,V.,suddenly as if arrested by fear or a feeling of wonder
1484,V.,still she stood with her colorless lips apart while a shudder
1485,V.,ran through her frame and forgotten the flowerets dropped from her fingers
1486,V.,and from her eyes and cheeks the light and bloom of the morning
1487,V.,then there escaped from her lips a cry of such terrible anguish
1488,V.,that the dying heard it and started up from their pillows
1489,V.,on the pallet before her was stretched the form of an old man
1490,V.,long and thin and gray were the locks that shaded his temples
1491,V.,but as he lay in the morning light his face for a moment
1492,V.,seemed to assume once more the forms of its earlier manhood
1493,V.,so are wont to be changed the faces of those who are dying
1494,V.,hot and red on his lips still burned the flush of the fever
1495,V.,as if life like the hebrew with blood had besprinkled its portals
1496,V.,that the angel of death might see the sign and pass over
1498,V.,seemed to be sinking down through infinite depths in the darkness
1501,V.,heard he that cry of pain and through the hush that succeeded
1504,V.,then he beheld in a dream once more the home of his childhood
1506,V.,village and mountain and woodlands and walking under their shadow
1507,V.,as in the days of her youth evangeline rose in his vision
1508,V.,tears came into his eyes and as slowly he lifted his eyelids
1509,V.,vanished the vision away but evangeline knelt by his bedside
1510,V.,vainly he strove to whisper her name for the accents unuttered
1511,V.,died on his lips and their motion revealed what his tongue would have spoken
1512,V.,vainly he strove to rise and evangeline kneeling beside him
1513,V.,kissed his dying lips and laid his head on her bosom
1514,V.,sweet was the light of his eyes but it suddenly sank into darkness
1515,V.,as when a lamp is blown out by a gust of wind at a casement
1517,V.,all was ended now the hope and the fear and the sorrow
1519,V.,all the dull deep pain and constant anguish of patience
1520,V.,and as she pressed once more the lifeless head to her bosom
1521,V.,meekly she bowed her own and murmured father i thank thee
1524,V.,still stands the forest primeval but far away from its shadow
1525,V.,side by side in their nameless graves the lovers are sleeping
1527,V.,in the heart of the city they lie unknown and unnoticed
1528,V.,daily the tides of life go ebbing and flowing beside them
1529,V.,thousands of throbbing hearts where theirs are at rest and forever
1530,V.,thousands of aching brains where theirs no longer are busy
1531,V.,thousands of toiling hands where theirs have ceased from their labors
1532,V.,thousands of weary feet where theirs have completed their journey
1534,V.,still stands the forest primeval but under the shade of its branches
1536,V.,only along the shore of the mournful and misty atlantic
1538,V.,wandered back to their native land to die in its bosom
1539,V.,in the fishermans cot the wheel and the loom are still busy
1540,V.,maidens still wear their norman caps and their kirtles of homespun
1543,V.,speaks and in accents disconsolate answers the wail of the forest
