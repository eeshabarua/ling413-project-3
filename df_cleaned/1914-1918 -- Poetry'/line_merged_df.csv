0,PREFACE,i must apologize for the size of this booklet which can only be
1,PREFACE,justified on the grounds that there is some demand for the contents as
2,PREFACE,recitations i hope presently to combine whatever is worth preserving
3,PREFACE,in my three volumes of verse so as to make a single collection
4,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,and i hear some one cry clear the front for the guards
5,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,of all things foul and black my heart is hot
6,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,than all the peace that comes to such as i
7,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",push on my lord of w端rtemberg across the flemish fen
8,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",theres just one ragged british line of plumers weary men
9,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",its true they held you off before but venture it again
10,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",youve been some little time my lord perhaps you scarce remember
11,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",was it in october last or was it in november
12,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",and now the leaves are turning and you stand in midseptember
13,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",can you recall the fateful daya day of drifting skies
14,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",can it be the warlord blundered when he urged the enterprise
15,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",for surely its a weary while since first before your eyes
16,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you held council at your quarters when the budding alexanders
17,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",ever ventured the opinion that a little town of flanders
18,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you all clasped hands upon it you would break the british line
19,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you would smash a road to westward with your host
20,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",till calais heard the blaring of the distant wacht am rhein
21,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",said the graf von feueressen its a fact beyond discussion
22,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",there is valour in the french there is patience in the russian
23,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",but blend all warlike virtues and you get the lordly prussian
24,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",tis the only sort of music that will call them to the battle
25,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",and so next day your battle rolled across the menin plain
26,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you broke him and you broke him but you broke him all in vain
27,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",and on the day when gheluvelt lay smoking in the sun
28,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you smiled as haig reeled backwards and you thought him on the run
29,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",but alas for dreams that vanish for before the day was done
30,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",spruce and splendid in the morning were the potsdam grenadiere
31,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",but not so spruce that evening when they staggered spent and weary
32,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you knewyour spies had told youthat the ranks were scant and thin
33,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",that the guns were short of shell and very few
34,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",by all bernhardis maxims you were surely bound to win
35,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",theres the open town before you haste my lord and enter in
36,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",then came the rainy winter when the price was ever dearer
37,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",every time you neared the prize of which you dreamed
38,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",each day the belfry faced you but you never brought it nearer
39,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",each night you saw it clearly but you never saw it clearer
40,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",at last there came the easter when you loosed the coward gases
41,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you could see them spent and choking as you watched them thro your
42,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",yes they choke but never waver and again the moment passes
43,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",then at hooge you had them helpless for their guns were one to ten
44,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you had them dead and buried but they still sprang up again
45,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",each in turn you tried them but the story was the same
46,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",play it how you would my lord you never won the game
47,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",a year my lord of w端rtemberga year or nearly so
48,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",your learned commandanten are the men who ought to know
49,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",but to ordinary mortals it would seem a trifle slow
50,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",if you cannot _straf_ the british since they _strafen_ you so well
51,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you can safely smash the town that lies so near
52,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",so its down with arch and buttress down with belfry and with bell
53,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",and its _hoch_ the sevenseven that can drop the petrol shell
54,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",on the shrines that pious hands have loved to rear
55,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",fair ypres was a relic of the soul of other days
56,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",we will keep it as a symbol of your brute teutonic ways
57,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",that millions yet unborn may come and curse you as they gaze
58,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",for shame my lord of w端rtemberg across the flemish fen
59,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",its just the old familiar line of fifty thousand men
60,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",theyve beat you once or twice my lord but venture it again
61,THE VOLUNTEER,of a six days stunt on an east coast front
62,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,my life is gliding downwards it speeds swifter to the day
63,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,when it shoots the last dark ca単on to the plains of faraway
64,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,but while its stream is running through the years that are to be
65,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,the mighty voice of canada will ever call to me
66,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i shall hear the roar of rivers where the rapids foam and tear
67,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i shall smell the virgin upland with its balsamladen air
68,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,and shall dream that i am riding down the winding woody vale
69,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,with the packer and the packhorse on the athabasca trail
70,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i have passed the warden cities at the eastern watergate
71,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,where the hero and the martyr laid the corner stone of state
72,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,where lives a breed more strong at need to venture or endure
73,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i have seen the gorge of erie where the roaring waters run
74,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i have crossed the inland ocean lying golden in the sun
75,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,but the last and best and sweetest is the ride by hill and dale
77,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,ill dream again of fields of grain that stretch from sky to sky
78,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,and the little prairie hamlets where the cars go roaring by
79,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,wooden hamlets as i saw themnoble cities still to be
80,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,to girdle stately canada with gems from sea to sea
81,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,mother of a mighty manhood land of glamour and of hope
82,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,from the eastward seaswept islands to the sunny western slope
83,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,ever more my heart is with you ever more till life shall fail
84,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,ill be out with pack and packer on the athabasca trail
