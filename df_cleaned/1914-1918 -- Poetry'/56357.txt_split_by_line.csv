86,PREFACE,i must apologize for the size of this booklet which can only be
87,PREFACE,justified on the grounds that there is some demand for the contents as
88,PREFACE,recitations i hope presently to combine whatever is worth preserving
89,PREFACE,in my three volumes of verse so as to make a single collection
152,THE GUARDS CAME THROUGH,and i hear some one cry clear the front for the guards
355,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,of all things foul and black my heart is hot
358,THE GUNS IN SUSSEX,than all the peace that comes to such as i
386,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",push on my lord of w端rtemberg across the flemish fen
388,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",theres just one ragged british line of plumers weary men
389,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",its true they held you off before but venture it again
392,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",youve been some little time my lord perhaps you scarce remember
394,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",was it in october last or was it in november
395,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",and now the leaves are turning and you stand in midseptember
398,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",can you recall the fateful daya day of drifting skies
400,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",can it be the warlord blundered when he urged the enterprise
401,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",for surely its a weary while since first before your eyes
404,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you held council at your quarters when the budding alexanders
407,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",ever ventured the opinion that a little town of flanders
410,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you all clasped hands upon it you would break the british line
411,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you would smash a road to westward with your host
413,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",till calais heard the blaring of the distant wacht am rhein
415,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",said the graf von feueressen its a fact beyond discussion
417,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",there is valour in the french there is patience in the russian
418,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",but blend all warlike virtues and you get the lordly prussian
424,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",tis the only sort of music that will call them to the battle
426,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",and so next day your battle rolled across the menin plain
428,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you broke him and you broke him but you broke him all in vain
432,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",and on the day when gheluvelt lay smoking in the sun
434,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you smiled as haig reeled backwards and you thought him on the run
435,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",but alas for dreams that vanish for before the day was done
440,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",spruce and splendid in the morning were the potsdam grenadiere
441,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",but not so spruce that evening when they staggered spent and weary
444,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you knewyour spies had told youthat the ranks were scant and thin
445,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",that the guns were short of shell and very few
446,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",by all bernhardis maxims you were surely bound to win
447,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",theres the open town before you haste my lord and enter in
449,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",then came the rainy winter when the price was ever dearer
450,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",every time you neared the prize of which you dreamed
451,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",each day the belfry faced you but you never brought it nearer
452,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",each night you saw it clearly but you never saw it clearer
455,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",at last there came the easter when you loosed the coward gases
457,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you could see them spent and choking as you watched them thro your
459,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",yes they choke but never waver and again the moment passes
462,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",then at hooge you had them helpless for their guns were one to ten
464,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you had them dead and buried but they still sprang up again
470,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",each in turn you tried them but the story was the same
471,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",play it how you would my lord you never won the game
474,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",a year my lord of w端rtemberga year or nearly so
476,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",your learned commandanten are the men who ought to know
477,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",but to ordinary mortals it would seem a trifle slow
480,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",if you cannot _straf_ the british since they _strafen_ you so well
481,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",you can safely smash the town that lies so near
482,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",so its down with arch and buttress down with belfry and with bell
483,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",and its _hoch_ the sevenseven that can drop the petrol shell
484,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",on the shrines that pious hands have loved to rear
486,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",fair ypres was a relic of the soul of other days
488,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",we will keep it as a symbol of your brute teutonic ways
489,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",that millions yet unborn may come and curse you as they gaze
492,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",for shame my lord of w端rtemberg across the flemish fen
494,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",its just the old familiar line of fifty thousand men
495,"SEPTEMBER, 1915",theyve beat you once or twice my lord but venture it again
550,THE VOLUNTEER,of a six days stunt on an east coast front
949,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,my life is gliding downwards it speeds swifter to the day
950,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,when it shoots the last dark ca単on to the plains of faraway
951,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,but while its stream is running through the years that are to be
952,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,the mighty voice of canada will ever call to me
953,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i shall hear the roar of rivers where the rapids foam and tear
954,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i shall smell the virgin upland with its balsamladen air
955,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,and shall dream that i am riding down the winding woody vale
956,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,with the packer and the packhorse on the athabasca trail
958,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i have passed the warden cities at the eastern watergate
959,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,where the hero and the martyr laid the corner stone of state
961,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,where lives a breed more strong at need to venture or endure
962,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i have seen the gorge of erie where the roaring waters run
963,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,i have crossed the inland ocean lying golden in the sun
964,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,but the last and best and sweetest is the ride by hill and dale
965,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,with the packer and the packhorse on the athabasca trail
967,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,ill dream again of fields of grain that stretch from sky to sky
968,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,and the little prairie hamlets where the cars go roaring by
969,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,wooden hamlets as i saw themnoble cities still to be
970,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,to girdle stately canada with gems from sea to sea
971,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,mother of a mighty manhood land of glamour and of hope
972,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,from the eastward seaswept islands to the sunny western slope
973,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,ever more my heart is with you ever more till life shall fail
974,THE ATHABASCA TRAIL,ill be out with pack and packer on the athabasca trail
