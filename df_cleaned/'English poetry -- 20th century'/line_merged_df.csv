5,PREFACE,it is a perilous adventurethe writing of a preface however brief to
6,PREFACE,ones own poems for one may be tempted to restate matters that could
7,PREFACE,find their full elucidation only in the verses themselves tennyson once
8,PREFACE,remarked that poetry is like shot silk glancing with many colours and
9,PREFACE,any attempt to define its meanings is as great a mistake as the attempt
10,PREFACE,its logical nutshells through poetry alone whether of deeds or words
11,PREFACE,thought or colour passion or marble is it possible to approach the
12,PREFACE,but this revelation is the sole end and object of all true art and i
13,PREFACE,hope it may not be thought presumptuous to say here simply
14,PREFACE,thatwhether the attempt be a success or a failureit was especially
15,PREFACE,my own aim in the two following poems if the feet of childhood are set
16,PREFACE,dancing in them it was because as children we are best able to enter
17,PREFACE,into that kingdom of dreams which is also the only true the only real
18,PREFACE,kingdom the first tale for instance must not be taken to have any
19,PREFACE,real relation to japan it belongsas the _spectator_ put itto the
20,PREFACE,kind of dreamland which an imaginative child might construct out of the
21,PREFACE,oddities of a willowpattern plate and it differs chiefly from
22,PREFACE,wonderlands of the lewis carrol type in a certain seriousness behind its
23,PREFACE,fantasy it is astonishing to me that these things require comment but
24,PREFACE,undoubtedly they do for on the one hand the first tale has been
25,PREFACE,praised enthusiastically as a vivid picture of japan and the author has
26,PREFACE,not only had to correspond with tokyo on the subject but was also
27,PREFACE,invited to meetings of the japan society in london on the other hand
28,PREFACE,because the childvoices are allowed to declare that tusitala lies
29,PREFACE,asleep in that distant country of dreams a prosaic english critic once
30,PREFACE,wrote a lengthy review in an important paper to point out my gross
31,PREFACE,ignorance of the fact that stevenson was really buried in samoa the
32,PREFACE,tales are such stuff as dreams are made on butas a kinder critic
33,PREFACE,has remarkedwe ourselves are made of that stuff it is perhaps
34,PREFACE,because these poems are almost light enough for a nonsensebook that i
35,PREFACE,feel there is something in them more elemental more essential more
36,PREFACE,poem i could write they are based on the fundamental and very simple
37,PREFACE,mystery of the universethat anything even a grain of sand should
38,PREFACE,exist at all if we could understand that we could understand
39,PREFACE,everything set clear of all irrelevancies that is the simple problem
40,PREFACE,that has been puzzling all the ages and it is well sometimes to forget
41,PREFACE,our accumulated knowledge and return to it in all its childish
42,PREFACE,_naïveté_ it is well to face that inconceivable miracle that
43,PREFACE,contradiction in terms that fundamental paradox for which we have at
44,PREFACE,best only a cruciform symbol with its arms pointing in opposite
45,PREFACE,the inscription on the wisdom lookingglass the discovery by the
46,PREFACE,children that the selflimitation of their little wishes was necessary
47,PREFACE,not only to their own happiness but to the harmony of the whole world
48,PREFACE,the development of the same idea in the passages leading up to the
49,PREFACE,song_what does it take to make a rose_where a _divine_ act of
50,PREFACE,passion of the godhead such as perhaps was shadowed forth on calvary
51,PREFACE,is found to be at the heart of the universe and to beas it werethe
52,PREFACE,highest aspect of the paradox aforesaid the living secret and price of
53,PREFACE,our very existence these things are only one twisted strand of the
54,PREFACE,shot silk out of which the two tales are woven it is no new wisdom to
55,PREFACE,regard these things through the eyes of little children and i
56,PREFACE,contain as deep and true things as i personally have the power to
57,PREFACE,express i hope therefore that i may be pardoned in these hurried
58,PREFACE,days for pointing out that the two poems are not to be taken merely as
59,PREFACE,fairytales but as an attempt to follow the careless and happy feet of
60,PREFACE,childhood back into the kingdom of those dreams which as we said above
61,PREFACE,are the sole reality worth living and dying for those beautiful dreams
62,PREFACE,or those fantastic jestsif any care to call them sofor which mankind
63,PREFACE,has endured so many triumphant martyrdoms that even amidst the rush and
64,SONG,our guide was he sleeping we could not wake him
65,SONG,were the words of the doom that he dared not name
66,SONG,and sneered have you stolen the strength of the skies
67,SONG,and our hearts will be softened and let you go
68,SONG,till it seemed that the soul of the whole world sung
69,SONG,if you taught us the truths that we always know
70,SONG,can you tell us the length of a monkeys beard
71,SONG,or the weight of the gems on the emperors fan
72,SONG, yet a thing like a monkey shrivelled and black
73,SONG,in the face of a foe that he cannot but fear
74,SONG,as the cry of a wizard that dares not own
75,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,so the cry flapped off as a wild goose flies
76,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE, a dead ape lay where their feet had been 
77,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,and the black trees dripped like the fringe of a marsh
78,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,but we came to a bend and the white moon glowed
79,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,like a gate at the end of the narrowing road
80,SONG,as we came to the great black tower of apes
81,THE MYSTIC RUBY,and we saw that the cave was a diamond hall
82,THE MYSTIC RUBY,and we saw that his face grew sad and wan
83,THE MYSTIC RUBY,but his robe was gone as a dream that flies
84,THE MYSTIC RUBY,yet we thought that the world grew thrice more sweet
85,THE MYSTIC RUBY,and the seas grew soft as a flower of light
86,SONG,and oer us the whole of the soft blue sky
87,SONG,and the journey was done like a change in a dream
88,PRELUDE,hush if you remember how we sailed to old japan
89,PRELUDE,now weve lost him so they say i think the tall thin man
90,PRELUDE,must have come and touched him with his curious twinkling fan
91,PRELUDE,hell be frightened all alone well find him if we can
92,PRELUDE,no one would believe us if we told them what we know
93,PRELUDE,if theyd only watched us roaming through the streets of miyako
94,PRELUDE,and seen the golden gardens where we wandered once with peterkin
95,PRELUDE,hang it by the wooden sword we made for little peterkin
96,PRELUDE,pile your arms beneath it for the owlet light is come
97,PRELUDE,well wander through the roses where we marched of old with peterkin
98,PRELUDE,well search the summer sunset where the hybla beehives hum
99,PRELUDE,andif we meet a fairy therewell ask for news of peterkin
100,PRELUDE,he was once our cabinboy and cooked the sweets for tea
101,PRELUDE,and o weve sailed around the world with laughing little peterkin
102,PRELUDE,from nursery floor to pantry door weve roamed the mighty sea
103,PRELUDE,and come to port below the stairs in distant caribee
104,PRELUDE,but wheresoeer we sailed we took our little lubber peterkin
105,PRELUDE,because his wide grey eyes believed much more than ours could see
106,PRELUDE,and so we liked our peterkin our trusty little peterkin
107,PRELUDE,the captain of our host today should be the bugler peterkin
108,PRELUDE,and he should lead our smugglers up that steep and narrow track
109,PRELUDE,a band of noble brigands bearing each a mighty pack
110,PRELUDE,crammed with lace and jewels to the secret cave of peterkin
111,PRELUDE,and he should wear the biggest boots and make his pistol crack
112,PRELUDE,the spanish cloak the velvet mask wed give them all to peterkin
113,PRELUDE,for people think weve lost him and when we come to say
114,PRELUDE,our goodnight prayers to mother if we pray for little peterkin
115,PRELUDE,her eyes are very sorrowful she turns her head away
116,PRELUDE,i wonder if theyve taken him again across the sea
117,PRELUDE,to the land of many marvels where we roamed of old with peterkin
118,PRELUDE,the land of blue pagodas and the flowery fields of tea
119,THE SPLENDID SECRET,and you saw it had roots in the depths of the sky
120,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,your house is on fire and your children are gone_
121,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,and hurryskurry heart and heel and hand we tore along
122,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,and still our flying feet kept time and pattered on for peterkin
123,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,for peterkin oh peterkin it made a kind of song
124,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,to prove the road was right although it seemed so dark and wrong
125,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,where many a hidden junglebeast made noises like a gong
126,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,that rolled and roared and rumbled as we rushed along to peterkin
127,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,and answer us one little word from little lonely peterkin
128,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,to take and comfort father he is sitting in his chair
129,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,in the library hes listening for your footstep on the stair
130,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,and your patter down the passage he can only think of peterkin
131,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,come back come back to father for today hed let us tear
132,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,his newest book to make a paperboat for little peterkin
133,SONG,_as we yearn for the home that we never shall win
134,SONG,and the poor and the weak are a spoil for the strong
135,SONG,there was never a doubt in those clear bright eyes
136,SONG,this world is a dream say the old and the wise
137,SONG,and its rainbows arise oer the false and the true
138,SONG,but the mists of the morning are made of our sighs_
139,SONG,and the thorns of the desert shall bloom with the rose
140,SONG,the sheeps in the meadow the cows in the corn
141,SONG,ah set the world right as a little one may
142,SONG,then from out a weird old wicket overgrown with shaggy hair
143,SONG,like a weird and wicked eyebrow round a weird and wicked eye
144,SONG,with a shy and soothing smile from out his lair
145,SONG,_wont you walk into my parlour i can make you cosy there_
146,SONG,and we couldnt quite remember where wed heard that phrase before
147,SONG,as the great greybearded ogre stood beside his open door
148,SONG,but an echo seemed to answer from a land beyond the sky
149,SONG,_wont you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly_
150,SONG,then we looked a little closer at the ogre as he stood
151,SONG,with his great red eyeballs glowing like two torches in a wood
152,SONG,and his mighty speckled belly and his dreadful clutching claws
153,SONG,and his nosea horny parrots beak his whiskers and his jaws
154,SONG,yet he seemed so sympathetic and we saw two tears descend
155,SONG,as he murmured im so ugly but ive lost my dearest friend
156,SONG,i tell you most lymphaticly ive yearnings in my soul
157,SONG,and right along his parrots beak we saw the teardrops roll
158,SONG,_wont you weep upon my bosom said the spider to the fly_
159,SONG,if youd dreamed my dreams of beauty if youd seen my works of art
160,SONG,if youd felt the cruel hunger that is gnawing at my heart
161,SONG,and the grief that never leaves me and the love i cant forget
162,SONG,for i loved with all the letters in the chinese alphabet
163,SONG,oh youd all come in to comfort me you ought to help the weak
164,SONG,and the haunting echo answered _well im sure you ought to try
165,SONG,theres a duty to ones neighbour said the spider to the fly_
166,SONG,that he locked the door behind us so we stood with bated breath
167,SONG,where the smoke of some great city loops and droops in gorgeous veils
168,SONG,ruffled the dark figures on them made them moan like things in pain
169,SONG,how we wished that we were safe at home again
170,SONG,oh we want to hear of peterkin good sir you say you know
171,SONG,wont you tell us wont you put us in the way we want to go
172,SONG,so we pleaded for he seemed so very full of sighs and tears
173,SONG,that we couldnt doubt his kindness and we smothered all our fears
174,SONG,but he said you must be crazy if you come to me for help
175,SONG,why should i desire to send you to your horrid little whelp
176,SONG,heavens you mustnt be so selfish said the spider to the fly_
177,SONG,still when the king of scotland so to speak was in a hole
178,SONG,he was aided by my brother its a story to console
179,SONG,the convict on the treadmill and the infant with a sum
180,SONG,for it teaches you to try again until your kingdoms come
181,SONG,the monarch dawdled in that hole for centuries of time
182,SONG,until my own twinbrother rose and showed him how to climb
183,SONG,he showed him how to swing and sway upon a tiny thread
184,SONG,if he only did it frequently and tried and tried again
185,SONG,and once again the whisper like a moral wandered by
186,SONG,_perseverance is a virtue said the spider to the fly_
187,SONG,then he moaned my heart is hungry but i fear i cannot eat
188,SONG,for i only fed an hour ago but if we calmly sat
189,SONG,while i told you all my troubles in a confidential chat
190,SONG,it would give me _such_ an appetite to hear you sympathise
191,SONG,and i should sleep the bettersee the tears are in my eyes
192,SONG,dead yearnings are such dreadful things lets keep em all alive
193,SONG,lets sit and talk awhile my dears well dine i think at five
194,SONG,and he brought his chair beside us in his most engaging style
195,SONG,and began to tell his story with a melancholy smile
196,SONG,as he scurried on his cruel hairy crutches to the door
197,SONG,wont you walk into my parlour ive some little friends to tea
198,SONG,and suddenly the hermit turned and ran with all his might
199,SONG,through the backdoor of his parlour as we thought of little peterkin
200,SONG,and the great grey roof was shattered by a shower of rosy light
201,SONG,and the spiderhouse went floating torn and tattered through the night
202,SONG,in a flight of prismy streamers as a shout went up for peterkin
203,SONG,and lo the glistening fairyhost stood there arrayed for fight
204,SONG,in arms of rose and green and gold to lead us on to peterkin
205,SONG,and all around us rippling like a pearl and opal sea
206,SONG,the host of fairy faces winked a kindly hint of peterkin
207,SONG,and all around the rosy glade a laugh of fairy glee
208,SONG,till the moonlight caught the gossamers and oh we wished for peterkin
209,SONG,each rope became a rainbow but it made us ache to see
210,SONG,so we told our tale of faëry to the king of fairyland
211,SONG,and asked if he could let us know the latest news of peterkin
212,SONG,and he turned him with a courtly smile and waved his jewelled wand
213,SONG,_well these are little children you must lead them on to peterkin_
214,SONG,then he knelt the king of faëry knelt his eyes were great and grand
215,SONG,as he took our hands and kissed them saying _father
216,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,his eyes were deep like the eyes of a poet
217,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,they made you feel sure it would always be best
218,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,to tell him the truth he was not perhaps _quite_
219,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,by the side of a nest like a great thick wood
220,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,and we feared he might take us perhaps for a worm
221,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,but he ruffled his breast with the sound of a storm
222,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,there was nothing to fear it was only a lark
223,SONG,_passing awayflower from the spray colour and light from the leaf
224,SONG,soon soon will the year shed its bloom on her bier and
226,SONG,soon soon will the year shed its bloom on her bier and the
227,SONG,_passing awayflower from the spray colour and light from the leaf_
228,SONG,_soon soon will the year shed its bloom on her bier and
229,SONG,_fairies must die ask ye not whyye that have hurt her so_
230,SONG,we came to the gates of the city of sleep
231,SONG,and we heard as the sound of a great sea sighing
232,SONG,or a wild red rose from the gardens of pain
233,SONG,but the reds and the yellows _would_ mix and run
234,SONG,and the blue of the sky made a horrible mess
235,SONG,and the old blind man just as though he had eyes
236,SONG,of the crowd were hushed and a strange sweet calm
237,SONG,stole through the air like a breath of the balm
238,SONG,and the blind man cried our help is at hand
239,SONG,we passed to the gates of the city and there
240,SONG,and lo like a sorrow that melts from the heart
241,SONG,_you that have seen how the world and its glory_
242,SONG,_change and grow old like the love of a friend_
243,SONG,_you that have come to the end of the story_
244,SONG,_you that were tired ere you came to the end_
245,SONG,and we knew as we went up that twisted street
246,SONG,a sound that was faint as the smile of pity
247,SONG,and it swung to the tramp of our marching feet
248,SONG,_dreams that we loved with our head on her breast_
249,SONG,_ay for her voice was the sound we loved best_
251,SONG,and so to the end of the street we came
252,SONG,in a place that glowed like the dawn of day
253,SONG,as the swingboats hurtled over our heads to the tune of the roundabout
254,SONG,and _little boy blue come blow up your horn_ we heard the showmen cry
255,SONG,and _dickory dock im as good as a clock_ we heard the swings reply
256,SONG,and the pauper shall mount his throne in the skies
257,SONG,and souls that were dead shall be fed with fire
258,SONG,and your lost love come with the light in her eyes
259,SONG,this way for the smile of a dead mans face
260,SONG,_dickory dock im as good as a clock_ dyou hear my swivels chime
261,SONG,to and fro as i come and go i keep eternal time
262,SONG,leave em alone and theyll come home and carry their tails behind em
263,SONG,as the swingboats answered the roaring tune of the rollicking roundabout
264,SONG,swing swing youre as good as a king if you keep eternal time
265,SONG,then we saw that the tunes of the world were one
266,SONG,was at one like the ebb and the flow of the sea
267,SONG,with the tunes that we learned at our mothers knee
268,SONG,and so by the rhymes that we knew we could tell
269,SONG,were no less than the cries of the poets and sages
270,SONG,of the world would be reached with one mighty shout
271,SONG,till it seemed that the mad song burst its bars
272,SONG,_a child was born in bethlehem in bethlehem in bethlehem_
273,SONG,_a child was born in bethlehem ah hear my fairy fable_
274,SONG,_for i have seen the king of kings no longer thronged with angel wings_
275,SONG,_but croodling like a little babe and cradled in a stable_
276,SONG,_the wise men came to greet him with their gifts
277,SONG,_gold and myrrh and frankincense they brought to make him mirth_
278,SONG,_and would you know the way to win to little brother peterkin_
279,SONG,_my childhoods heart shall guide you through the glories of the earth_
281,SONG,_the wise men came to welcome him a star stood oer the gable_
282,SONG,_and there they saw the kings of kings no longer
284,SONG,and creeping through the music once again the fairy cry
285,SONG,came freezing oer the snowy towers to lead us on to peterkin
286,SONG,once more the fairy bugles blew from lands beyond the sky
287,SONG,and we all groped out together dazed and blind we knew not why
288,SONG,out through the citys farther gates we went to look for peterkin
289,SONG,out out into the dark unknown and heard the clamour die
290,SONG,far far away behind us as we trotted on to peterkin
291,SONG,a childs voice clear as the voice of a bird
292,SONG,_what is there hid in the heart of a rose_
293,SONG,and all around the temple of the smallest of the flowers
294,SONG,the glory of the angels made a star for little peterkin
295,SONG,for all the kings of splendour and all the heavenly powers
296,SONG,with all their globed and radiant wings to make a star for peterkin
297,SONG,the star that shone upon the east a star that still is ours
298,SONG,wheneer we hang our stockings up a star of wings for peterkin
299,THE HAPPY ENDING,_the wise men came to greet him with their gifts
300,THE HAPPY ENDING,_gold and myrrh and frankincense they brought to make him mirth_
