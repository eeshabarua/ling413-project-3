66,PREFACE,it is a perilous adventurethe writing of a preface however brief to
67,PREFACE,ones own poems for one may be tempted to restate matters that could
68,PREFACE,find their full elucidation only in the verses themselves tennyson once
69,PREFACE,remarked that poetry is like shot silk glancing with many colours and
70,PREFACE,any attempt to define its meanings is as great a mistake as the attempt
72,PREFACE,its logical nutshells through poetry alone whether of deeds or words
73,PREFACE,thought or colour passion or marble is it possible to approach the
81,PREFACE,but this revelation is the sole end and object of all true art and i
82,PREFACE,hope it may not be thought presumptuous to say here simply
83,PREFACE,thatwhether the attempt be a success or a failureit was especially
84,PREFACE,my own aim in the two following poems if the feet of childhood are set
85,PREFACE,dancing in them it was because as children we are best able to enter
86,PREFACE,into that kingdom of dreams which is also the only true the only real
87,PREFACE,kingdom the first tale for instance must not be taken to have any
88,PREFACE,real relation to japan it belongsas the _spectator_ put itto the
89,PREFACE,kind of dreamland which an imaginative child might construct out of the
90,PREFACE,oddities of a willowpattern plate and it differs chiefly from
91,PREFACE,wonderlands of the lewis carrol type in a certain seriousness behind its
92,PREFACE,fantasy it is astonishing to me that these things require comment but
93,PREFACE,undoubtedly they do for on the one hand the first tale has been
94,PREFACE,praised enthusiastically as a vivid picture of japan and the author has
95,PREFACE,not only had to correspond with tokyo on the subject but was also
96,PREFACE,invited to meetings of the japan society in london on the other hand
97,PREFACE,because the childvoices are allowed to declare that tusitala lies
98,PREFACE,asleep in that distant country of dreams a prosaic english critic once
99,PREFACE,wrote a lengthy review in an important paper to point out my gross
100,PREFACE,ignorance of the fact that stevenson was really buried in samoa the
101,PREFACE,tales are such stuff as dreams are made on butas a kinder critic
102,PREFACE,has remarkedwe ourselves are made of that stuff it is perhaps
103,PREFACE,because these poems are almost light enough for a nonsensebook that i
104,PREFACE,feel there is something in them more elemental more essential more
106,PREFACE,poem i could write they are based on the fundamental and very simple
107,PREFACE,mystery of the universethat anything even a grain of sand should
108,PREFACE,exist at all if we could understand that we could understand
109,PREFACE,everything set clear of all irrelevancies that is the simple problem
110,PREFACE,that has been puzzling all the ages and it is well sometimes to forget
111,PREFACE,our accumulated knowledge and return to it in all its childish
112,PREFACE,_naïveté_ it is well to face that inconceivable miracle that
114,PREFACE,contradiction in terms that fundamental paradox for which we have at
115,PREFACE,best only a cruciform symbol with its arms pointing in opposite
118,PREFACE,the inscription on the wisdom lookingglass the discovery by the
119,PREFACE,children that the selflimitation of their little wishes was necessary
120,PREFACE,not only to their own happiness but to the harmony of the whole world
121,PREFACE,the development of the same idea in the passages leading up to the
122,PREFACE,song_what does it take to make a rose_where a _divine_ act of
124,PREFACE,passion of the godhead such as perhaps was shadowed forth on calvary
125,PREFACE,is found to be at the heart of the universe and to beas it werethe
126,PREFACE,highest aspect of the paradox aforesaid the living secret and price of
127,PREFACE,our very existence these things are only one twisted strand of the
128,PREFACE,shot silk out of which the two tales are woven it is no new wisdom to
129,PREFACE,regard these things through the eyes of little children and i
131,PREFACE,contain as deep and true things as i personally have the power to
132,PREFACE,express i hope therefore that i may be pardoned in these hurried
133,PREFACE,days for pointing out that the two poems are not to be taken merely as
134,PREFACE,fairytales but as an attempt to follow the careless and happy feet of
135,PREFACE,childhood back into the kingdom of those dreams which as we said above
136,PREFACE,are the sole reality worth living and dying for those beautiful dreams
137,PREFACE,or those fantastic jestsif any care to call them sofor which mankind
138,PREFACE,has endured so many triumphant martyrdoms that even amidst the rush and
774,SONG,our guide was he sleeping we could not wake him
806,SONG,were the words of the doom that he dared not name
814,SONG,and sneered have you stolen the strength of the skies
817,SONG,and our hearts will be softened and let you go
829,SONG,till it seemed that the soul of the whole world sung
836,SONG,if you taught us the truths that we always know
838,SONG,can you tell us the length of a monkeys beard
839,SONG,or the weight of the gems on the emperors fan
850,SONG, yet a thing like a monkey shrivelled and black
854,SONG,in the face of a foe that he cannot but fear
857,SONG,as the cry of a wizard that dares not own
886,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,so the cry flapped off as a wild goose flies
892,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE, a dead ape lay where their feet had been 
915,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,and the black trees dripped like the fringe of a marsh
920,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,but we came to a bend and the white moon glowed
921,THE CRY OF THE MAD MOONSHEE,like a gate at the end of the narrowing road
980,SONG,as we came to the great black tower of apes
1187,THE MYSTIC RUBY,and we saw that the cave was a diamond hall
1222,THE MYSTIC RUBY,and we saw that his face grew sad and wan
1229,THE MYSTIC RUBY,but his robe was gone as a dream that flies
1278,THE MYSTIC RUBY,yet we thought that the world grew thrice more sweet
1285,THE MYSTIC RUBY,and the seas grew soft as a flower of light
1317,SONG,and oer us the whole of the soft blue sky
1321,SONG,and the journey was done like a change in a dream
1452,PRELUDE,hush if you remember how we sailed to old japan
1454,PRELUDE,now weve lost him so they say i think the tall thin man
1455,PRELUDE,must have come and touched him with his curious twinkling fan
1457,PRELUDE,hell be frightened all alone well find him if we can
1460,PRELUDE,no one would believe us if we told them what we know
1462,PRELUDE,if theyd only watched us roaming through the streets of miyako
1464,PRELUDE,and seen the golden gardens where we wandered once with peterkin
1469,PRELUDE,hang it by the wooden sword we made for little peterkin
1472,PRELUDE,pile your arms beneath it for the owlet light is come
1473,PRELUDE,well wander through the roses where we marched of old with peterkin
1474,PRELUDE,well search the summer sunset where the hybla beehives hum
1475,PRELUDE,andif we meet a fairy therewell ask for news of peterkin
1477,PRELUDE,he was once our cabinboy and cooked the sweets for tea
1478,PRELUDE,and o weve sailed around the world with laughing little peterkin
1479,PRELUDE,from nursery floor to pantry door weve roamed the mighty sea
1480,PRELUDE,and come to port below the stairs in distant caribee
1481,PRELUDE,but wheresoeer we sailed we took our little lubber peterkin
1482,PRELUDE,because his wide grey eyes believed much more than ours could see
1483,PRELUDE,and so we liked our peterkin our trusty little peterkin
1486,PRELUDE,the captain of our host today should be the bugler peterkin
1487,PRELUDE,and he should lead our smugglers up that steep and narrow track
1488,PRELUDE,a band of noble brigands bearing each a mighty pack
1489,PRELUDE,crammed with lace and jewels to the secret cave of peterkin
1490,PRELUDE,and he should wear the biggest boots and make his pistol crack
1491,PRELUDE,the spanish cloak the velvet mask wed give them all to peterkin
1495,PRELUDE,for people think weve lost him and when we come to say
1496,PRELUDE,our goodnight prayers to mother if we pray for little peterkin
1497,PRELUDE,her eyes are very sorrowful she turns her head away
1502,PRELUDE,i wonder if theyve taken him again across the sea
1504,PRELUDE,to the land of many marvels where we roamed of old with peterkin
1505,PRELUDE,the land of blue pagodas and the flowery fields of tea
1569,THE SPLENDID SECRET,and you saw it had roots in the depths of the sky
1835,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,your house is on fire and your children are gone_
1868,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,and hurryskurry heart and heel and hand we tore along
1869,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,and still our flying feet kept time and pattered on for peterkin
1870,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,for peterkin oh peterkin it made a kind of song
1871,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,to prove the road was right although it seemed so dark and wrong
1874,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,where many a hidden junglebeast made noises like a gong
1875,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,that rolled and roared and rumbled as we rushed along to peterkin
1878,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,and answer us one little word from little lonely peterkin
1879,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,to take and comfort father he is sitting in his chair
1880,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,in the library hes listening for your footstep on the stair
1881,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,and your patter down the passage he can only think of peterkin
1882,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,come back come back to father for today hed let us tear
1883,THE FIRST DISCOVERY,his newest book to make a paperboat for little peterkin
2062,SONG,_as we yearn for the home that we never shall win
2064,SONG,and the poor and the weak are a spoil for the strong
2069,SONG,there was never a doubt in those clear bright eyes
2072,SONG,this world is a dream say the old and the wise
2073,SONG,and its rainbows arise oer the false and the true
2074,SONG,but the mists of the morning are made of our sighs_
2080,SONG,and the thorns of the desert shall bloom with the rose
2083,SONG,the sheeps in the meadow the cows in the corn
2084,SONG,ah set the world right as a little one may
2124,SONG,then from out a weird old wicket overgrown with shaggy hair
2125,SONG,like a weird and wicked eyebrow round a weird and wicked eye
2131,SONG,with a shy and soothing smile from out his lair
2132,SONG,_wont you walk into my parlour i can make you cosy there_
2134,SONG,and we couldnt quite remember where wed heard that phrase before
2135,SONG,as the great greybearded ogre stood beside his open door
2136,SONG,but an echo seemed to answer from a land beyond the sky
2137,SONG,_wont you walk into my parlour said the spider to the fly_
2139,SONG,then we looked a little closer at the ogre as he stood
2140,SONG,with his great red eyeballs glowing like two torches in a wood
2141,SONG,and his mighty speckled belly and his dreadful clutching claws
2142,SONG,and his nosea horny parrots beak his whiskers and his jaws
2143,SONG,yet he seemed so sympathetic and we saw two tears descend
2144,SONG,as he murmured im so ugly but ive lost my dearest friend
2145,SONG,i tell you most lymphaticly ive yearnings in my soul
2146,SONG,and right along his parrots beak we saw the teardrops roll
2148,SONG,_wont you weep upon my bosom said the spider to the fly_
2150,SONG,if youd dreamed my dreams of beauty if youd seen my works of art
2151,SONG,if youd felt the cruel hunger that is gnawing at my heart
2152,SONG,and the grief that never leaves me and the love i cant forget
2153,SONG,for i loved with all the letters in the chinese alphabet
2154,SONG,oh youd all come in to comfort me you ought to help the weak
2156,SONG,and the haunting echo answered _well im sure you ought to try
2157,SONG,theres a duty to ones neighbour said the spider to the fly_
2168,SONG,that he locked the door behind us so we stood with bated breath
2175,SONG,where the smoke of some great city loops and droops in gorgeous veils
2182,SONG,ruffled the dark figures on them made them moan like things in pain
2183,SONG,how we wished that we were safe at home again
2187,SONG,oh we want to hear of peterkin good sir you say you know
2188,SONG,wont you tell us wont you put us in the way we want to go
2189,SONG,so we pleaded for he seemed so very full of sighs and tears
2190,SONG,that we couldnt doubt his kindness and we smothered all our fears
2191,SONG,but he said you must be crazy if you come to me for help
2192,SONG,why should i desire to send you to your horrid little whelp
2196,SONG,heavens you mustnt be so selfish said the spider to the fly_
2198,SONG,still when the king of scotland so to speak was in a hole
2199,SONG,he was aided by my brother its a story to console
2200,SONG,the convict on the treadmill and the infant with a sum
2201,SONG,for it teaches you to try again until your kingdoms come
2202,SONG,the monarch dawdled in that hole for centuries of time
2203,SONG,until my own twinbrother rose and showed him how to climb
2204,SONG,he showed him how to swing and sway upon a tiny thread
2207,SONG,if he only did it frequently and tried and tried again
2208,SONG,and once again the whisper like a moral wandered by
2209,SONG,_perseverance is a virtue said the spider to the fly_
2211,SONG,then he moaned my heart is hungry but i fear i cannot eat
2213,SONG,for i only fed an hour ago but if we calmly sat
2214,SONG,while i told you all my troubles in a confidential chat
2215,SONG,it would give me _such_ an appetite to hear you sympathise
2216,SONG,and i should sleep the bettersee the tears are in my eyes
2217,SONG,dead yearnings are such dreadful things lets keep em all alive
2218,SONG,lets sit and talk awhile my dears well dine i think at five
2219,SONG,and he brought his chair beside us in his most engaging style
2220,SONG,and began to tell his story with a melancholy smile
2292,SONG,as he scurried on his cruel hairy crutches to the door
2295,SONG,wont you walk into my parlour ive some little friends to tea
2396,SONG,and suddenly the hermit turned and ran with all his might
2397,SONG,through the backdoor of his parlour as we thought of little peterkin
2398,SONG,and the great grey roof was shattered by a shower of rosy light
2399,SONG,and the spiderhouse went floating torn and tattered through the night
2400,SONG,in a flight of prismy streamers as a shout went up for peterkin
2401,SONG,and lo the glistening fairyhost stood there arrayed for fight
2402,SONG,in arms of rose and green and gold to lead us on to peterkin
2404,SONG,and all around us rippling like a pearl and opal sea
2405,SONG,the host of fairy faces winked a kindly hint of peterkin
2406,SONG,and all around the rosy glade a laugh of fairy glee
2408,SONG,till the moonlight caught the gossamers and oh we wished for peterkin
2409,SONG,each rope became a rainbow but it made us ache to see
2430,SONG,so we told our tale of faëry to the king of fairyland
2431,SONG,and asked if he could let us know the latest news of peterkin
2432,SONG,and he turned him with a courtly smile and waved his jewelled wand
2434,SONG,_well these are little children you must lead them on to peterkin_
2435,SONG,then he knelt the king of faëry knelt his eyes were great and grand
2436,SONG,as he took our hands and kissed them saying _father
2472,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,his eyes were deep like the eyes of a poet
2480,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,they made you feel sure it would always be best
2481,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,to tell him the truth he was not perhaps _quite_
2488,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,by the side of a nest like a great thick wood
2493,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,and we feared he might take us perhaps for a worm
2495,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,but he ruffled his breast with the sound of a storm
2499,PEASE-BLOSSOM AND MUSTARD-SEED,there was nothing to fear it was only a lark
2617,SONG,_passing awayflower from the spray colour and light from the leaf
2618,SONG,soon soon will the year shed its bloom on her bier and
2633,SONG,_passing awayflower from the spray colour and light from the leaf
2634,SONG,soon soon will the year shed its bloom on her bier and the
2649,SONG,_passing awayflower from the spray colour and light from the leaf_
2650,SONG,_soon soon will the year shed its bloom on her bier and
2668,SONG,_fairies must die ask ye not whyye that have hurt her so_
2699,SONG,we came to the gates of the city of sleep
2711,SONG,and we heard as the sound of a great sea sighing
2724,SONG,or a wild red rose from the gardens of pain
2733,SONG,but the reds and the yellows _would_ mix and run
2734,SONG,and the blue of the sky made a horrible mess
2737,SONG,and the old blind man just as though he had eyes
2739,SONG,of the crowd were hushed and a strange sweet calm
2740,SONG,stole through the air like a breath of the balm
2744,SONG,and the blind man cried our help is at hand
2753,SONG,we passed to the gates of the city and there
2759,SONG,and lo like a sorrow that melts from the heart
2776,SONG,_you that have seen how the world and its glory_
2777,SONG,_change and grow old like the love of a friend_
2778,SONG,_you that have come to the end of the story_
2779,SONG,_you that were tired ere you came to the end_
2794,SONG,and we knew as we went up that twisted street
2800,SONG,a sound that was faint as the smile of pity
2805,SONG,and it swung to the tramp of our marching feet
2828,SONG,_dreams that we loved with our head on her breast_
2830,SONG,_ay for her voice was the sound we loved best_
2838,SONG,a sound that was faint as the smile of pity
2858,SONG,and so to the end of the street we came
2860,SONG,in a place that glowed like the dawn of day
2870,SONG,as the swingboats hurtled over our heads to the tune of the roundabout
2871,SONG,and _little boy blue come blow up your horn_ we heard the showmen cry
2872,SONG,and _dickory dock im as good as a clock_ we heard the swings reply
2876,SONG,and the pauper shall mount his throne in the skies
2878,SONG,and souls that were dead shall be fed with fire
2880,SONG,and your lost love come with the light in her eyes
2887,SONG,this way for the smile of a dead mans face
2892,SONG,_dickory dock im as good as a clock_ dyou hear my swivels chime
2893,SONG,to and fro as i come and go i keep eternal time
2896,SONG,leave em alone and theyll come home and carry their tails behind em
2899,SONG,as the swingboats answered the roaring tune of the rollicking roundabout
2901,SONG,swing swing youre as good as a king if you keep eternal time
2903,SONG,then we saw that the tunes of the world were one
2905,SONG,was at one like the ebb and the flow of the sea
2906,SONG,with the tunes that we learned at our mothers knee
2909,SONG,and so by the rhymes that we knew we could tell
2914,SONG,were no less than the cries of the poets and sages
2918,SONG,of the world would be reached with one mighty shout
2928,SONG,till it seemed that the mad song burst its bars
2942,SONG,_a child was born in bethlehem in bethlehem in bethlehem_
2943,SONG,_a child was born in bethlehem ah hear my fairy fable_
2944,SONG,_for i have seen the king of kings no longer thronged with angel wings_
2945,SONG,_but croodling like a little babe and cradled in a stable_
2946,SONG,_the wise men came to greet him with their gifts
2948,SONG,_gold and myrrh and frankincense they brought to make him mirth_
2949,SONG,_and would you know the way to win to little brother peterkin_
2950,SONG,_my childhoods heart shall guide you through the glories of the earth_
2952,SONG,_a child was born in bethlehem in bethlehem in bethlehem_
2953,SONG,_the wise men came to welcome him a star stood oer the gable_
2954,SONG,_and there they saw the kings of kings no longer
2956,SONG,_but croodling like a little babe and cradled in a stable_
2958,SONG,and creeping through the music once again the fairy cry
2959,SONG,came freezing oer the snowy towers to lead us on to peterkin
2960,SONG,once more the fairy bugles blew from lands beyond the sky
2961,SONG,and we all groped out together dazed and blind we knew not why
2962,SONG,out through the citys farther gates we went to look for peterkin
2963,SONG,out out into the dark unknown and heard the clamour die
2964,SONG,far far away behind us as we trotted on to peterkin
3075,SONG,a childs voice clear as the voice of a bird
3087,SONG,_what is there hid in the heart of a rose_
3120,SONG,and all around the temple of the smallest of the flowers
3121,SONG,the glory of the angels made a star for little peterkin
3122,SONG,for all the kings of splendour and all the heavenly powers
3124,SONG,with all their globed and radiant wings to make a star for peterkin
3125,SONG,the star that shone upon the east a star that still is ours
3126,SONG,wheneer we hang our stockings up a star of wings for peterkin
3177,THE HAPPY ENDING,_the wise men came to greet him with their gifts
