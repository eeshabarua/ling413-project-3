                        _QUARTZ from the UPLANDS_


  Who Say? “All songs have been sung;
            All tales have been told;
            Live tongues are still’d--
            Worn smooth by precedent!”

        In the fullness of the soul
        There lives--strong bound--
        Only to be unloos’d by greater deed and action;
        An unfathomable wealth
        From which to draw forever--
        Never to be wholly used.

          Is it for you
          To stand at the bier of the dead past
          Mute--to consent, that:
          “All! has been sung and writ”?

    No! Insistingly, Persistently beat loud upon the temple
        door--steeled well to hear the mock and din and laughter
        and deriding, doubting shouts of those within,
      That you may full awake the throng without--
      Those who sleep, work, hope and pray.
      You must proclaim again, again,
      This Truth!
      The multitude at last will stand aghast, amazed, ashamed;
      Thy liberty deny,
      Yea, crucify.

    To them:--What is, is; and what is, is to remain unchanged forever.

      To learn the lesson, to equip and grade thy purging fire;
      Go forth to some unfrequented spot
      And reason with thyself, comparing notes with Nature.

      See it. Feel it. Hear it.
    The all-prevailing, pervading, constant, ever changing. From
        Winter’s silence, breathing, sighing, sleeping, creeping
        on to Spring with sap, with shoot, with bud and flower,
        hour on hour playing, plying gentleness and power for Summer’s
        rest to temper strength for birth in Autumn, with crowning
        brilliancy and rich rewards untaxed to bird, to beast, to
        insect and to man, gift on gift for full contentment,
        sustenance and labor.

      From this you will accumulate a store so full,
      That every thought’s a prayer;
      The simplest acts of things are miracles--
      The whole a revelation,
      To guide thy way and being.

    Kill not, dissect not, nor rend or tear,
    But see and feel and hear.

        The earth, the air and sea abound
        With righteous living creatures,
        Intent upon some full purpose;--
        Aside from man’s estate,
        Aside from his designing selfishness, intensely useless
          graspings, destruction, purposeless desire,
        For his good use and keeping,
        The forest, field and sea
        And all that lies beneath.

      But if to be a “Bard Sublime?”--
      A prater,
      Aspiring to soar ’midst lofty peaks on painted scenes; to
        catch with musty mystery; with empty schemes of praise;
        with sheens of artificial light, spread o’er this prolonged
        night and sleep of letters; or with palsied moonbeams that
        miniature the day and blight tart speech and full-ripe reason;
      To buoy vanity;
      To bid for foolish charlatan’s esteem,
      To live apart at ease and shirk,
      Good hard holy healthy work;
      To mingle not with clean magnetic dirt,
      With healing, building sunshine, air and rain.--
    Then be a heralder of “New Thought”
      Cite from thy store:
      Great Deeds
      And haughty interminglings;
      Praise, to have a share;
      Valor, in which words win;
      Chastisement, which you do not feel;
      Abnegation, with no self-denial.

        Whatever thy saying,
        Mark you full well
        That all such machinations
        Must and will be counted less
        Than Brawn-Studies in great Nature’s realm.

    If swept away from Nature’s gentle sway
    Too weak to rise and understand
    Thy full purpose, and the coming day:--
    Then feed, feed on thy kind and kith and kin
    Plunge in, into the maelstrom;
    Amidst the deaf’ning roar,
    Swim ’midst molten masses,
    Breast cataracts of seething, living action,
    Tell of harnessing of power,
    Of screech and scream,
    Of whirr of wheels;
    Of lightning’s use and speed;
    Of clank and bang and whisp and twirl of rasp and
      plane and drill on rock and wood and metal.
    For therein lies a ripe, rich, unwrit story;
    And place the credit where the credit’s due.
    Use freely, and without fear thy caustic pen,
    Ruffle, ruthlessly pursue, dog and undo
    Proud spirited, designing men.

  Spur the laggard.

        Jeer at that part of press which teems with
          misstatements, lies, inuendos--
        Those who prod and sting;
        Excite the very life they claim to be,
        For gain,
        For great and greater power, circulation.

    A song or story to go on, up, through distant ages
    Must be full told and strong with facts:--

      Tell of myriads of human beings,
      Crushed, dwarfed, poisoned and devoured,
      By the arts and manufactures;
      Voices drown’d, subdued, smothered amid the din.

    Tell of the march of industry’s deafening roar
      affecting a nation’s reasoning and sealing its
      store of finest instincts.

        Tell of designing kings of trade
        Who, on a _free man’s_ soil!
        So multiplied their wealth
        That all their fellow-beings
        Were their _willing_ slave--
        Slaves living lives in imputrid bodies--
        Souls seasoned with sorrows and blasted hopes;
        Of endless yesterdays,
        Long looking and longing and looking
        For happiness, to come on some to-morrow.

        Tell of serfs, dumb,
        Blind and starved by greed;
        Ground ’twixt its own mill-stones;
        Prating prayers to God
        While God looks on amazed
        At supine strength
        Behind these wills and souls inactive.

    Bound to an unjust cause;
    Held firm by statute and multiplying laws.

        Tell how they bound themselves:
          For paltry bits of food--
          For half-made clothes--
          And shacks for shelter
      For which they gave full rights to use Man’s Acre,
      And all the treasures that lie beneath.

        Tell of rampant selfishness run riot;
        Of countless serfs--
        The earth’s scum;
        Floating to this _free_ land
        To climb upon it and gorge on gold _galore_;
        With inspirations only of eternal happiness in idleness;
        Playing wanton parts;
        Dragging in their brazened gods and images;
        Feeding on rotten greed;
        Loaded with besotted vices
        Practising stupid customs,
        These, all these--
        With voice and vote,--
        To sweep aside the well devised purpose,
        Built by patriarchs for _equal_ rights and honors.

    They came, to make a Nation of all nations--
    But after all, no nation,
    No man’s land.

    Tell of poisoned, delayed and decayed food in transit.

        Tell of the settlement of nations’ differences
        By “good offices” for peace,
        With long--drawn--out, decrepit, verbose, empty ceremony.

    Of International Law--
    The Will of Power.

      Of nations, swearing by the “Prince of Peace”
      Continuing to fortify with great and greater guns,
      Mobilizing husbands to defeat husbandry;
      Bedecking them with gilt without,
      Stuffing vanity and pompousness within.

        But, if you see through the roseate glass,
        Of swaggering optimism
        Proclaim, that:--
          “‘God is working out His will’--
          Too slow perhaps
          For challengers of spotted vice;
          For those who seek for the world’s and the Nation’s
            failings, inhuman sloth, stubbornness and sin.”

      Whatever thy chronicle,
      Let it not savor of a full stomach’s satisfaction
      That feels content with ill-got gain derived from tricks of trade.

        Live amidst conditions on both sides;
        Experience the chill and pinch of poverty;
        Feel the cold steel bands about an undeveloped soul;
        Want for tools and an opportunity to do some useful chosen work,
        Then will you write full well,
        Write strong thy story,
        Chronicling on golden pages;
        Infinite views,
        To march to triumph with the Truth of Truths;
        ’Twill live on and up and through
        The distant ages.

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
