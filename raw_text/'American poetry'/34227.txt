PUBLISHERS' NOTE


_The first two of the poems here printed have long been popular
favorites, but the third was not written till near the end of Mr.
Harte's life. It rounds out the romance with such completeness and charm
that it is peculiarly fitting that the poems should be grouped, and
issued in a form worthy of their own excellence. The coöperation of Mr.
Keller was secured for making the illustrations, not only on account of
his recognized ability as an artist, but also because of his admiration
for Mr. Harte's writings and his previous success in illustrating
several of the stories._

HER LETTER


          I'M sitting alone by the fire,
            Dressed just as I came from the dance,
          In a robe even _you_ would admire,--
            It cost a cool thousand in France;
          I'm be-diamonded out of all reason,
            My hair is done up in a cue:
          In short, sir, "the belle of the season"
            Is wasting an hour upon you.


[Illustration:

         _In short, sir, "the belle of the season"
          Is wasting an hour upon you_]


          A DOZEN engagements I've broken;
            I left in the midst of a set;
          Likewise a proposal, half spoken,
            That waits--on the stairs--for me yet.
          They say he'll be rich,--when he grows up,--
            And then he adores me indeed;
          And you, sir, are turning your nose up,
            Three thousand miles off, as you read.


[Illustration:

          _Likewise a proposal, half spoken,
           That waits--on the stairs--for me yet_]


          "AND how do I like my position?"
            "And what do I think of New York?"
          "And now, in my higher ambition,
            With whom do I waltz, flirt, or talk?"
          "And isn't it nice to have riches,
            And diamonds and silks, and all that?"
          "And aren't they a change to the ditches
            And tunnels of Poverty Flat?"


[Illustration: _With whom do I waltz, flirt, or talk?_]


          WELL, yes,--if you saw us out driving
            Each day in the Park, four-in-hand,
          If you saw poor dear mamma contriving
            To look supernaturally grand,--
          If you saw papa's picture, as taken
            By Brady, and tinted at that,--
          You'd never suspect he sold bacon
            And flour at Poverty Flat.


[Illustration:

          _If you saw poor dear Mamma contriving
           To look supernaturally grand_]


          AND yet, just this moment, when sitting
            In the glare of the grand chandelier,--
          In the bustle and glitter befitting
            The "finest _soirée_ of the year,"--
          In the mists of a _gaze de Chambéry_,
            And the hum of the smallest of talk,--
          Somehow, Joe, I thought of the "Ferry,"
            And the dance that we had on "The Fork;"


[Illustration:

          _In the mists of a gaze de Chambéry,
           And the hum of the smallest of talk_]


          OF Harrison's barn, with its muster
            Of flags festooned over the wall;
          Of the candles that shed their soft lustre
            And tallow on head-dress and shawl;
          Of the steps that we took to one fiddle,
            Of the dress of my queer _vis-à-vis_;
          And how I once went down the middle
            With the man that shot Sandy McGee;


[Illustration:

          _And how I once went down the middle
           With the man that shot Sandy McGee_]

[Illustration: _The man that shot Sandy McGee_]


          OF the moon that was quietly sleeping
            On the hill, when the time came to go;
          Of the few baby peaks that were peeping
            From under their bedclothes of snow;
          Of that ride,--that to me was the rarest;
            Of--the something you said at the gate.
          Ah! Joe, then I wasn't an heiress
            To "the best-paying lead in the State."


[Illustration: _Of that ride,--that to me was the rarest_]


          WELL, well, it's all past; yet it's funny
            To think, as I stood in the glare
          Of fashion and beauty and money,
            That I should be thinking, right there,
          Of some one who breasted high water,
            And swam the North Fork, and all that,
          Just to dance with old Folinsbee's daughter,
            The Lily of Poverty Flat.


[Illustration:

          _And swam the North Fork, and all that,
           Just to dance with old Folinsbee's daughter_]


          BUT goodness! what nonsense I'm writing!
            (Mamma says my taste still is low),
          Instead of my triumphs reciting,
            I'm spooning on Joseph,--heigh-ho!
          And I'm to be "finished" by travel,--
            Whatever's the meaning of that.
          Oh, why did papa strike pay gravel
            In drifting on Poverty Flat?


[Illustration: _Mamma says my taste still is low_]


          GOOD-NIGHT!--here's the end of my paper;
            Good-night!--if the longitude please,--
          For maybe, while wasting my taper,
            _Your_ sun's climbing over the trees.
          But know, if you haven't got riches,
            And are poor, dearest Joe, and all that,
          That my heart's somewhere there in the ditches,
            And you've struck it,--on Poverty Flat.


[Illustration:

HIS ANSWER


          BEING asked by an intimate party,--
            Which the same I would term as a friend,--
          Though his health it were vain to call hearty,
            Since the mind to deceit it might lend;
          For his arm it was broken quite recent,
            And there's something gone wrong with his lung,--
          Which is why it is proper and decent
            I should write what he runs off his tongue.


[Illustration:

          _Which is why it is proper and decent
           I should write what he runs off his tongue_]

[Illustration: _Being asked by an intimate party_]


          FIRST, he says, Miss, he's read through your letter
            To the end,--and "the end came too soon;"
          That a "slight illness kept him your debtor,"
            (Which for weeks he was wild as a loon);
          That "his spirits are buoyant as yours is;"
            That with you, Miss, he "challenges Fate"
          (Which the language that invalid uses
            At times it were vain to relate).


[Illustration:

          _That "his spirits are buoyant as yours is;"
           That with you, Miss, he "challenges Fate"_]


          AND he says "that the mountains are fairer
            For once being held in your thought;"
          That each rock "holds a wealth that is rarer
            Than ever by gold-seeker sought."
          (Which are words he would put in these pages,
            By a party not given to guile;
          Though the claim not, at date, paying wages,
            Might produce in the sinful a smile.)


[Illustration:

          _Though the claim not, at date, paying wages,
           Might produce in the sinful a smile_]


          HE remembers the ball at the Ferry,
            And the ride, and the gate, and the vow,
          And the rose that you gave him,--that very
            Same rose he is "treasuring now."
          (Which his blanket he's kicked on his trunk, Miss,
            And insists on his legs being free;
          And his language to me from his bunk, Miss,
            Is frequent and painful and free.)


[Illustration: _And the rose that you gave him_]

[Illustration:

          _And his language to me from his bunk, Miss,
           Is frequent and painful and free_]


          HE hopes you are wearing no willows,
            But are happy and gay all the while;
          That he knows--(which this dodging of pillows
            Imparts but small ease to the style,
          And the same you will pardon)--he knows, Miss,
            That, though parted by many a mile,
          "Yet, were _he_ lying under the snows, Miss,
            They'd melt into tears at your smile."


[Illustration:

          _Which this dodging of pillows
           Imparts but small ease to the style_]


          AND "you'll still think of him in your pleasures,
            In your brief twilight dreams of the past;
          In this green laurel spray that he treasures,--
            It was plucked where your parting was last;
          In this specimen,--but a small trifle,--
            It will do for a pin for your shawl."
          (Which, the truth not to wickedly stifle,
            Was his last week's "clean up,"--and _his all_.)


[Illustration:

          _In this green laurel-spray that he treasures,
           It was plucked where your parting was last_]


          HE'S asleep, which the same might seem strange, Miss,
            Were it not that I scorn to deny
          That I raised his last dose, for a change, Miss,
            In view that his fever was high;
          But he lies there quite peaceful and pensive.
            And now, my respects, Miss, to you;
          Which my language, although comprehensive,
            Might seem to be freedom, is true.


[Illustration: _But he lies there quite peaceful and pensive_]


          FOR I have a small favor to ask you,
            As concerns a bull-pup, and the same,--
          If the duty would not overtask you,--
            You would please to procure for me, _game_;
          And send per express to the Flat, Miss,--
            For they say York is famed for the breed,
          Which, though words of deceit may be that, Miss,
            I'll trust to your taste, Miss, indeed.


[Illustration:

          _For I have a small favor to ask you,
           As concerns a bull-pup_]


          _P.S._--Which this same interfering
            Into other folks' way I despise;
          Yet if it so be I was hearing
            That it's just empty pockets as lies
          Between you and Joseph, it follers
            That, having no family claims,
          Here's my pile, which it's six hundred dollars
            As is _yours_, with respects,
                                        TRUTHFUL JAMES.

HER LAST LETTER


          JUNE 4th! Do you know what that date means?
            June 4th! by this air and these pines!
          Well,--only you know how I hate scenes,--
            These might be my very last lines!
          For perhaps, sir, you'll kindly remember--
            If some _other_ things you've forgot--
          That you last wrote the 4th of _December_,--
            Just six months ago!--from this spot;


[Illustration:

          _That you last wrote the 4th of December,--
           Just six months ago!--from this spot_]


          FROM this spot, that you said was "the fairest
            For once being held in my thought."
          Now, really I call that the barest
            Of--well, I won't say what I ought!
          For here I am back from my "riches,"
            My "triumphs," my "tours," and all that;
          And _you_'re not to be found in the ditches
            Or temples of Poverty Flat!


[Illustration:

          _And you're not to be found in the ditches

[Illustration:

          _From this spot, that you said was "the fairest

          FROM Paris we went for the season
            To London, when pa wired, "Stop."
          Mamma says "his _health_" was the reason.
            (I've heard that some things took a "drop.")
          But she said if my patience I'd summon
            I could go back with him to the Flat--
          Perhaps I was thinking of some one
            Who of me--well--was not thinking _that_!


[Illustration:

          _From Paris we went for the season
           To London, when Pa wired, "Stop"_]


          OF course you will _say_ that I "never
            Replied to the letter you wrote."
          That is just like a man! But, however,
            I read it--or how could I quote?
          And as to the stories you've heard (No,
            Don't tell me you haven't--I know!)
          You'll not believe one blessed word, Joe;
            But just whence they came, let them go!


[Illustration:

          _And as to the stories you've heard (No,
           Don't tell me you haven't--I know!)_]


          AND they came from Sade Lotski of Yolo,
            Whose father sold clothes on the Bar--
          You called him Job-lotski, you know, Joe,
            And the boys said _her_ value was _par_.
          Well, we met her in Paris--just flaring
            With diamonds, and lost in a hat!
          And she asked me "How Joseph was faring
            In his love-suit on Poverty Flat!"


[Illustration:

          _Whose father sold clothes on the Bar--
           You called him Job-lotski, you know, Joe_]


          SHE thought it would shame me! I met her
            With a look, Joe, that made her eyes drop;
          And I said that your "love-suit fared better
            Than any suit out of _their_ shop!"
          And I didn't blush _then_--as I'm doing
            To find myself here, all alone,
          And left, Joe, to do all the "suing"
            To a lover that's certainly flown.


[Illustration:

                                    _I met her
          With a look, Joe, that made her eyes drop_]

[Illustration:

          _And I didn't blush then--as I'm doing
           To find myself here, all alone_]


          IN this brand-new hotel, called "The Lily"
            (I wonder who gave it that name?),
          I really am feeling quite silly,
            To think I was once called the same;
          And I stare from its windows, and fancy
            I'm labeled to each passer-by.
          Ah! gone is the old necromancy,
            For nothing seems right to my eye.


[Illustration:

          _Ah! gone is the old necromancy,
           For nothing seems right to my eye_]


          ON that hill there are stores that I knew not;
            There's a street--where I once lost my way;
          And the copse where you once tied my shoe-knot
            Is shamelessly open as day!
          And that bank by the spring--I once drank there,
            And you called the place Eden, you know;
          Now, I'm banished like Eve--though the bank there
            Is belonging to "Adams and Co."


[Illustration:

          _And that bank by the spring--I once drank there,
           And you called the place Eden, you know_]

[Illustration:

          _And the copse where you once tied my shoe-knot
           Is shamelessly open as day!_]


          THERE'S the rustle of silk on the sidewalk;
            Just now there passed by a tall hat;
          But there's gloom in this "boom" and this wild talk
            Of the "future" of Poverty Flat.
          There's a decorous chill in the air, Joe,
            Where once we were simple and free;
          And I hear they've been making a mayor, Joe,
            Of the man who shot Sandy McGee.


[Illustration:

          _There's the rustle of silk on the sidewalk;
           Just now there passed by a tall hat_]

          BUT there's still the "lap, lap" of the river;
            There's the song of the pines, deep and low.
          (How my longing for them made me quiver
            In the park that they call Fontainebleau!)
          There's the snow-peak that looked on our dances,
            And blushed when the morning said, "Go!"
          There's a lot that remains which one fancies--
            But somehow there's never a Joe!


[Illustration: _But there is still the "lap, lap" of the river_]

[Illustration: _There's a lot that remains which one fancies_]


          PERHAPS, on the whole, it is better,
            For you might have been changed like the rest;
          Though it's strange that I'm trusting this letter
            To papa, just to have it addressed.
          He thinks he may find you, and really
            Seems kinder now I'm all alone.
          You might have been here, Joe, if merely
            To _look_ what I'm willing to _own_.


[Illustration: _He thinks he may find you_]


          WELL, well! that's all past; so good-night, Joe;
            Good-night to the river and Flat;
          Good-night to what's wrong and what's right, Joe;
            Good-night to the past, and all that--
          To Harrison's barn, and its dancers;
            To the moon, and the white peak of snow;
          And good-night to the cañon that answers
            My "Joe!" with its echo of "No!"


[Illustration:

          _And good-night to the cañon that answers
           My "Joe!" with its echo of "No!"_]


          _P.S._--I've just got your note. You deceiver!
            How dared you--how _could_ you? Oh, Joe!
          To think I've been kept a believer
            In things that were six months ago!
          And it's _you_'ve built this house, and the bank, too,
            And the mills, and the stores, and all that!
          And for everything changed I must thank _you_,
            Who have "struck it" on Poverty Flat!


[Illustration: _I've just got your note. You deceiver!_]


          HOW dared you get rich--you great stupid!--
            Like papa, and some men that I know,
          Instead of just trusting to Cupid
            And to me for your money? Ah, Joe!
          Just to think you sent never a word, dear,
            Till you wrote to papa for consent!
          Now I know why they had me transferred here,
            And "the health of papa"--what _that_ meant!

           Like papa, and some men that I know_]


          NOW I know why they call this "The Lily;"
            Why the man who shot Sandy McGee
          You made mayor! 'Twas because--oh, you silly!--
            He once "went down the middle" with me!
          I've been fooled to the top of my bent here,
            So come, and ask pardon--you know
          That you've still got to get _my_ consent, dear!
            And just think what that echo said--Joe!

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
