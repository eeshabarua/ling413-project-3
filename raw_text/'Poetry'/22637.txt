_A Little Window_




_Stars_

(_At Locheven_)


    Have you walked in the woods
    When twilight wraps a veil of mist
    Around the gray-green trees
    In early spring?
    It is then the snow-white trillium
    Gleam like stars from the carpet
    Of last year's leaves:
    And tall white violets glow
    Like clouds of nebulæ along the path.
    And flecked, like points of light
    In the quiet pools of water
    Among the gray-green boles,
    Are the stars of heaven.




_The Brook_

(_Westfield, N. Y._)


    Curling and humming its cadences,
    It slips past me under the rim of the gorge,
    As I peer down through the scarlet sumacs.
    Sparkling in the sunlight,
    Shimmering in the moonlight,
    On and on it goes,
    A silvery sheet of song.




_In Eden Valley_


    I saw

    A spray of orange berries etched against the silver of a stone wall:

    A scarlet vine encircling a golden sapling;

    On the ground, a carmine robe that had slipped from the shoulders of
        a maple.

    A sweep of meadow,
    A curve of bronzy hill,
    A glow of ruby and amethyst
    And the evergreens making deep quiet spots in it.




_Benediction_


    Silent, I stood in the forest--
    Lured by the liquid song
    Of a thrush.
    Clear, it was, then fading
    And softly echoed,
    As he slipped into the embrace
    Of the night.
    So pure, so holy, was his song
    That my heart was calmed
    And I was filled
    With serenity.




_A Moment_


    The beaten silver waters cut
    By the prow of our ship,
    Send off stars of phosphorous
    To vie with the stars overhead.
    Nothing but sky and the starlight,
    And a stretch of limitless sea,
    Nothing but peace and dominion,--
    Silence, immensity.




_The Month of Moonlight_


    Moonlight is not cold!
    It is tender and benignant,
    Softening all it touches,
    Hiding the roughness,
    Covering the coarseness,
    With a glow of silver splendor
    And a lucent flood
    Of beauty.




_Wings_


    There come to the flowers
    In my garden
    Butterflies, golden-spotted tawny,
    Blue-spangled and sulphur;
    Glistening dragon-flies, zooming bumble bees,
    Droning honey-bees.

    Softly whirring comes
    The vivid humming-bird,
      Sipping, sipping all day long.
    At nightfall I hear the flutter of the
    Luna's wings, as
    She caresses the velvet cheek
    Of the lily.




_Heart's Ease_

(_Locheven_)


    I love to tread a winding path
    Through the woods,
    And, world weary, pause upon it.
    The trees bend and enclose me
    In brooding calm;
    I feel the presence of Deity.

    I hear the cadence of the stillness--
    A stillness so alive.
    The whisper of the leaves,
    The song of the brook over golden stone
    The whir of a bird's wings;
    And I know the presence of Deity.




_The Sign Reads--"To Troutbeck"_

(_English Lakes_)


    An upcurving lane, hedged high,
    An ancient stile,
    A rambling path,
    A brook,
    And musk,--
    Golden bells of fragrance,
    Fusing all the odors
      Of English earth.




_I, Too_


    Robin, robin,
    Shouting your song,
    Your throat swelling
    With joy!
    Yes, I hear, I know
    What you say.
    For I, too,
    Would sing
    My praise and
    Gratitude
    To God!




_In Early Evening_


    When I drive through
    The villages and the countryside
    In early evening,
    And see people sitting in gardens
    Or at their doors
    In peace and contentment,
    I long to stop and speak to them.
    They might tell me of a loved one
    Doing some great work
    In a big city,
    Or of a deep sorrow,
    And I might say a word
    To help lighten it.
    They might show me treasured china
    Or a bit of lace, handmade;
    Once some one did.
    And I could talk with the children.
    I long to do this,
    But it always seems
    That there is a hurry
    To get to the next place.




_Fearless Winging_


    Into Niagara's abyss of blackness,
    Into its cavernous chaos,
    I saw birds wing.
    Sweeping down
    Through the mist
    Of its mighty waters,
    Undaunted by the roar,
    Unmindful of the churning,
    Of the terror of its power,
    On sure pinions
    And happy in flight
    They dipped and soared and
    Mounted, upward and upward.
    Into the light
    And the rainbow
    Above them.




_Whimsey_


    In spring my hemlock
    Dances gayly in flounces
    Of jade green lace.

    In summer moonlight
    When a soft wind stirs
    She dances with a delicate sapling.
    They sway and bend in the wind,
    And bow to the trees encircling.
    I hear the laughter of their leaves.

    In autumn she dances
    With beech leaves in her hair,

    But in winter I have found her still,
    Crouching under a blanket of snow.




_Remembering_

(_Locheven_)


    There is a spot in the woods
    That is "forever England" to me.
    A clump of beech trees
    Steeped in silence,
    Whose shade and solitude
    Shuts me in with my dreams.
    The sunshine slants through
    Their limpid leaves
    And turns them to translucent jade,
    Just as it does in an English spring.
    Violets are there, and I pluck them,
    Remembering the bluebells
    In the beech wood
    At Sevenoaks.




_Aloofness_


    Down among the docks and elevators and railroad tracks
    On the way out of the city,
    I pass a tiny cottage so rickety
    That its neighbors crowd close
    To hold it up. But there it is,
    Its one window shining clean, and glowing
    With a plant in a tin can and pure white curtains.
    Hanging over the fence and filling the whole place
    With its beauty and almost hiding the cottage
    Is a peach tree in full bloom.
    In the doorway I glimpse a girl
    In a purple dress.
    But what matters the smoke and the noise and the fog
    To the peach tree?




_Listening_

(_Eden, N. Y._)


    Atop Aries hill am I,
    The lone flyer, throbbing
    Against the sunset
    Is higher.
    He sees more than I,
    But he cannot hear
    What I hear.

    I hear the wood-thrush
    And the veery,
    Answer each other.
    I hear the voices
    Of happy children
    And the baying of hounds
    Float up from the valley;
    The chirp of the cricket
    At my feet, and, then,
    The silence of nightfall.

    He sees more than I,
    But he cannot hear
    What I hear.




_September's End_


    In the ash tree
    There is a soft rustling,
    Lingering, like
    A silken whisper,
    Quite different
    Than sound the other trees;
    As if the bronzy leaves
    Had much to say
    Before they part,
    And were loath
    To bid farewell.




_Content_

(_Westfield, N. Y._)


    When I linger in my garden
    And see black swallowtails hovering
    Over white phlox and orange zinnias,
    And morning glories, in a heavenly blue mass
    Surge upward on their trellis;
    When I watch the scintillating humming-bird
    Sip from the trumpet blossoms across my doorway,
    I feel no urge of travel to behold
    More of earth's beauty.
    Here in my little garden I have it all--
    And here I am content.




_Rhythm_


    Firelight, and strains of a symphony
      Wafting in.
    Outside, bare trees
      Against leaden skies
      Weave their own music
      That throbs with the rhythm
      Of the orchestra.
    The wind moans, and
      Strong, black branches
      Sway slowly,
      Mark the beat,
      Then stop.
    The wind hums,
      Delicate, lacelike tops
      Quiver and ripple
      With the quick response
      Of the violins.
    With the shriek of the wind
    They writhe and toss,
      Measuring the crescendo
      Of the brasses.




_Contrast_


    In an old world palace,
    Room after room
    Is filled with treasures--
    Old masters, jewels, glass.
    Yet all I remember
    Is the stark whiteness of a gardenia
    Blowing against a wall,
    And the fairy music of a fountain
    In the patio.




_Surety_


    I needed the dawn, but
    My eyes beheld only clouds
    And a valley filled with mists
    And a mountain shutting out the east.
    I needed the dawn, so
    I could but wait.
    Surely,
    Slowly
    Through the clouds
    The light came,
    Like a presence
    Dispelling mist and cloud:
    Even the mountain
    Could not hide it.
    My eyes beheld all clear,
    And in the roseate glow,
    Like a diamond,
    Hung the morning star.




_Guests_


    There was emptiness
    When the birds left in the fall.
    But to fill it came late butterflies,
    Dawdling flocks of brilliant things
    In clouds of scintillating beauty,
    Covering every bush and flower.
    As silently as they came did they disappear
    And in their place came the music
    Of the katydid and the cricket.
    Day and night the cheerful songs
    Of these tiny insects were our company.

    An early blizzard
    Buried every green blade and bent to earth
    Great trees and slender saplings
    Under a thick weight of snow.
    To our door came the thrushes
    That we thought were gone,--
    Shy thrushes, that had turned their backs
    Upon us in summer and slipped
    Into the depth of the woods,--
    And whitethroats and tree sparrows,
    Unafraid, waiting for food.
    Even now the stillness is alive
    With the memory of these friendly folk.




_Storm_


    When the storm rushes upon the deep woods,
    It lets down curtains of mist
    And sheets of rain, that drip
    Crystal beads among the trees.
    Way above, the branches lash and moan
    And weave. Below, it is still,
    Still as the undersea.
    Soft fern and feathery bracken
    Loom through the mist
    Like branching coral,
    And drifting leaves float down
    Like snowy fishes,
    Lazily moving.




_A Reminder_


    Down beneath the office windows
    In a chestnut clump,
    A robin sings all day long,
    "Joyously, joyously!"

    Above the whir of traffic,
    The bands and the sirens,
    Floats his song all day,
    "Joyously, joyously!"

    The lilting song brings to me,
    The peace of field and merry brook,
    And I myself, sing all day, too,
    "Joyously, joyously!"




_Buffalo Harbor_


    Some say that it is ugly and hurry on through,
    But I love these impressive symbols
    Of man's ingenuity.
    Here are the great grain elevators, looming
    In tones and shades of grey, veiled
    In the clouds of black smoke from the
    Tugs at their feet;
    Puffing engines shifting strings of cars,
    And huge ships nosed in against each other
    Or riding at anchor, and canal boats
    In straight lines at the docks.
    Farther on, across a slip, there are
    Mountains of ore in reds and brown,
    And pile upon pile of gravel and slag,
    And sand in soft saffron hues,
    Heaped up for the steel mills to devour;
    Those gigantic mills whose tall stacks
    Belch varicolored gases, against
    The deep blue of the inner harbor,
    Where the waves pound in
    Over the sea wall.
    All this cupped by the towering
    City skyscrapers, and outlined against
    The peaceful Eden hills,
    Miles to the south.
    And when I wait for the big bridge to lift
    For a freighter with its important tugs,
    I pull out of line, off to the side,
    And let the other cars go by,
    And look, and look.
    I never seem to get enough.




_From a Train Window_


    Once, before dawn,
    In the Mohawk valley,
    Dots of light flashed
    And floated off
    Into the blackness,
    Like sparks of flame
    Blasted from the engine.
    Then more and more,
    Mile after mile,
    Almost never ending--
    Millions of fire-flies,
    Like tiny torches,
    Dancing over swamp lands
    In the night air.




_Scotland_

(_The Highlands_)


    Mountains,
      Veiled in shifting vapors,
    Mountains,
      Bleak, foreboding,
    Mountains,
      Stark and overpowering.
    Torrents,
      Tumbling, crashing,
      Dragging boulders
      In their rushing,
    Lakes,
      Forlorn and lonesome
    Heather
      In magenta patches,
    Sheep, and cattle
      Black and somber,
    Winding roads
      Through massive passes.
    Rain,
    Sun,
    Flowers,
    Mist,
    Rain,--
      Loved Scotland!




_Friends_

(_At Lake Windermere, England_)


    Across the lake
    Lying calm and black
    Under the night,
    Floats the wail
    Of the pipes:
    And beyond, loom
    Langdale Pikes, dim,
    Shadowy sentinels.
    Over all, the stars,
    Like friends, faithful
    And changeless.




_A Poem of Color_


    Stretched on the ground beneath the Hawthorn,
    The perfume of its blossoms mingled with falling petals, floats
        down to me.
    Winged things alight there on the blanket of fragrance above,--a
        bunting, blue as the sky, a warbler, all gold, an Admiral, wings
        banded with crimson,
    Make a poem of color of the Hawthorn tree.




_Dream_

(_Stratford-on-Avon_)


    One warm June evening
    I sat in the churchyard
    Of old Trinity. I sat there for hours
    On an ancient stone, forgetting time.
    The Avon, as silent as the centuries it had known,
    Glided past, carrying me on with its memories.
    From the lush meadow across the river came the bleating of lambs,
    And from the limes floated the song of blackbirds.
    All about the scent of roses hung heavy.
    Then, over the roof of Trinity, the moon arose.
    Shakespeare saw the Avon, thus, and loved it,--
    Winding on in the moonlight.




_Escape_


    How simple life can be!
    A cabin,
    Mountains, afar and near,
    A brook,
    Deer, blowing at night.
    Perchance,
    Rain on the roof,
    Then,
    The loved books,
    A fire on the hearth,
    And endless time
    To think.
    How simple life is!




_Question_

(_Locheven_)


    Would you choose
    The formal garden
    With lilac hedges
    And vistas of velvet lawn
    And marble fountain
    Shining pool and
    Marble bench o'er-topped
    By drooping willow;
    Massed color in trim beds,
    And stately garden house
    Festooned with wisteria
    And guarded by strutting peacock?

              Or,

    The wood's garden,
    The wild garden,
    Tumbling over itself
    With pale Jacks, and violets--
    Blue and gold, and
    Baby ferns, tucked
    Within sheltering gnarled roots!
    And mossy mounds, starred
    With Trillium and Crane's bill;
    And patches of lavender sunlight,
    (No, it's wild Phlox,
    In the flickering light)--
    And fire-flies and flapping owls,
    At twilight, and furry rabbits,
    Bobbing ahead up the path.

    Which would you choose?




_When You Were a Little Girl_


    When you were a little girl
    And you went driving with Grandfather,
    If it rained, didn't he braid up the horse's tail
    Binding it round with a bright silver band,
    And fasten on the side curtains of the carriage
    And pull the rubber "boot" over the dashboard?
    And do you remember how the horse's feet
    Went "Plop, plop," in and out of the mud,
    And you felt the mist blow in on your face
    When you managed to peer out over the curtain?
    And didn't you snuggle up close to Grandfather
    And hug the Fairy Tale book
    Which he was going to listen to
    When the rain stopped and you lunched
    Beside the road?

    Didn't your Grandfather always drive over
    To the cheese factory, and bring out
    The fresh cheese curd to you?
    Can't you remember the taste, even now?
    And sometimes, when it stormed hard, and thundered
    And lightened, and the crashing made the horse
    Want to run, wouldn't your Grandfather always say:
    "Steady there, now, boy! Steady, boy!" so gently,
    That neither you nor the horse were afraid after that
    Because Grandfather said everything was all right,
    And he knew. And wasn't your Grandmother
    Waiting in the doorway, watching a bit anxiously,
    Until you turned into the yard?
            Mine was.




_Flight_


    So still lay the city,
    So very quietly it slept,
    That from high in the west
    I heard the honking of geese
    Winging southward.
    Yearningly I listened
    As they swept over,
    Yearningly I cried--
    O wild things, that I
    Could fly as do you!
    Then out of the silent darkness,
    Like a flying star,
    Flashed a plane
    With its skyborne humans.
    And all of a sudden
    I remembered that I, too,
    Could take to wings.




_Petit Trianon_

(_Versailles, France_)


    When the long drawn notes of a bird's song
    Echoes through the trees,
    It brings to remembrance the songs
    Of the blackbirds at Petit Trianon:
    Chiming, reverberating, floating down
    From the tops of the tall cedars
    As from an invisible, celestial choir.

    Nor can I forget the ages-old wisteria
    Clambering over gray palace walls,
    Nor the gamut of color in the azaleas there--
    Pink, orange, cerise, yellow--
    In pale green foliage.




_Joy_


    When your heavens are as brass
    And joy has fled, and
    Every door is shut,
    Do not forget the one
    That opens inward--
    The door of your heart,
    Whose handle is on the inside
    And which only you can open.
    Go out through that door
    And find one whose skies
    Are darker than yours,
    Whose burden is heavier;
    Bring him back with you
    Into your heart.

    There can you cleanse him with love,
    And clothe him with garments of truth,
    And put the ring of his unity
    With God upon his hand;
    There feed him with the word,
    And let him go.
    Then will your heavens be
    As radiant light,
    And your happiness and joy
    Such as never were
    On land or sea.




_Twilight Song Service_

(_"B.A." Chestnut Hill, Mass._)


    In the deepening twilight there floats
    From the chapel above, the loved hymns of healing--
    Hymns of comfort, of courage, welling up from grateful hearts
    And bringing reassurance of God's power
    To one who listens below in silent prayer and praise.
    Great peace of God, be with us all!
    Great peace of God encompass us!
    Speak to the waves tonight, Father, that they stand.
    Stretch forth Thy hand and stay their power,
    Calm them, that they overwhelm not.
    For Thy voice is "mightier than the noise of many waters,
    Yea, than the mighty waves of the sea."
    This Thou canst do, O my God.




_Triumph_


    These are they, O God,
    Who came out of great tribulation
    And have washed their robes white.
    Oh, holy triumph of those
    Who have endured the fire
    And the tempest's rage and, delivered,
    Stand exalted in this very hour,
    Purged, sanctified, and satisfied.
    These are they who have surrendered
    All the vanities of mortal selfhood,
    And serve Thee
    Day and night in Thy temple,
    Lifting others to behold
    The tearless, ageless, deathless reality
    Of Thy glory.

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
