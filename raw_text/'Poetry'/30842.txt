POEMS



FOR ***

  NO eyes shall see the poems that I write
  For you; not even yours; but after long
  Forgetful years have passed on our delight
  Some hand may chance upon a dusty song

  Of those fond days when every spoken word
  Was sweet, and all the fleeting things unspoken
  Yet sweeter, and the music half unheard
  Murmured through forests as a charm unbroken.

  It is the plain and ordinary page
  Of two who loved, sole-spirited and clear.
  Will you, O stranger of another age,
  Not grant a human and compassionate tear
  To us, who each the other held so dear?
  A single tear fraternal, sadly shed,
  Since that which was so living, is so dead.



SONG: LET US GO BACK

  LET us go back together to the hills.
  Weary am I of palaces and courts,
  Weary of words disloyal to my thoughts,--
  Come, my beloved, let us to the hills.

  Let us go back together to the land,
  And wander hand in hand upon the heights;
  Kings have we seen, and manifold delights,--
  Oh, my beloved, let us to the land!

  Lone and unshackled, let us to the road
  Which holds enchantment round each hidden bend,
  Our course uncompassed and our whim its end,
  Our feet once more, beloved, to the road!



SONG: MY SPIRIT LIKE A SHEPHERD BOY
"Convalescente di squisiti mali"

  MY spirit like a shepherd boy
  Goes dancing down the lane.
  When all the world is young with joy
  Must I lie here in pain?

  With shepherd's pipe my spirit fled
  And cloven foot of Pan;
  The mortal bondage he has shed
  And shackling yoke of man.

  And though he leave me cold and mute,
  A traitor to his care,
  I smile to hear his honeyed flute
  Hang on the scented air.



CONVALESCENCE

  WHEN I am in the Orient once again,
  And turn into the gay and squalid street,
  One side in the shadow, one in vivid heat,
  The thought of England, fresh beneath the rain,
  Will rise unbidden as a gently pain.
  The lonely hours of illness, as they beat
  Crawling through days with slow laborious feet,
  And I lay gazing through the leaded pane,
  Idle, and listened to the swallows' cry
  After the flitting insect swiftly caught,
  --Those all-too-leisured hours as they went by,
  Stamped as their heritage upon my thought
  The memory of a square of summer sky
  Jagged by the gables of a Gothic court.



TO KNOLE
October 1, 1913

  I
  I LEFT thee in the crowds and in the light,
  And if I laughed or sorrowed none could tell.
  They could not know our true and deep farewell
  Was spoken in the long preceding night.

  Thy mighty shadow in the garden's dip!
  To others dormant, but to me awake;
  I saw a window in the moonlight shake,
  And traced the angle of the gable's lip,

  And knew thy soul, benign and grave and mild,
  Towards me, morsel of morality,
  And grieving at the parting soon to be,
  A patriarch about to lose a child.

  For many come and soon their tale is told,
  And thou remainest, dimly feeling pain,
  Aware the time draws near to don again
  The sober mourning of the very old.

  II
  Pictures and galleries and empty rooms!
  Small wonder that my games were played alone;
  Half of the rambling house to call my own,
  And wooded gardens with mysterious glooms.

  My fingers ran among the tassels faded;
  My playmates moved in arrases brocaded;
  I slept beside the canopied and shaded
  Beds of forgotten kings.
  I wandered shoeless in the galleries;
  I contemplated long the tapestries,
  And loved the ladies for their histories
  And hands with many rings.

  Beneath an oriel window facing south
  Through which the unniggard sun poured morning
       streams,
  I daily stood and laughing drank the beams,
  And, catching fistfuls, pressed them in my mouth.

  This I remember, and the carven oak,
  The long and polished floors, the many stairs,
  Th' heraldic windows, and the velvet chairs,
  And portraits that I knew so well, they almost spoke.

  III
  So I have loved thee, as a lonely child
  Might love the kind and venerable sire
  With whom he lived, and whom at youthful fire
  Had ever sagely, tolerantly smiled;

  In whose old weathered brain a boundless store
  Lay hid of riches never to be spent;
  Who often to the coaxing child unbent
  In hours' enchantment of delightful lore.

  So in the night we parted, friend of years,
  I rose a stranger to thee on the morrow;
  Thy stateliness knows neither joy nor sorrow,--
  I will not wound such dignity by tears.



DISILLUSION

  I WROTE the burning words to you
  That meant so much to me.
  I sent them speeding straight to you,
  To you across the sea;
  I waited with sure reckoning
  For your reply to me.

  I waited, and the counted day
  Fruitlessly came and went;
  I made excuse for the delay,
  Pitiable confident.
  I knew to-morrow's light must bring
  The words you must have sent.

  And still I stand on that dim verge
  And look across the sea;
  The waves have changed into a dirge
  Their volubility.
  And in my disillusioned heart
  Is a little grave for me.

  But still with shaded eyes I gaze
  As mournfully I sing,
  And one by one the trailing days,
  As they no message bring,
  Fall with their slow monotony
  As beads fall from a string.



THE BANQUET

  WINE ran; rich yellow wine upon the marble floor
  Recklessly spilled; the Nubians ran to pour
  A fresh libation; and to scatter showers
  Of red rose petals; candles overturned
  Smouldered among the ruins of the flowers,
  And overhead swung heavy shadowy bowers
  Of blue and purple grapes,
  And strange fantastic shapes
  Of varied birds, where lanterns hung and dimly burned.

  The melon and the orange, turned to use
  As golden balls with laughter lightly tossed,
  Lay burst and drained of their sweet juice,
  Uselessly ripened and for ever lost;
  All glowing as they lay upon the ground,
  As envious of their fellows,
  Who, piled in luscious reds and yellows,
  Enriched the tables all around,
  The tables low,
  Sheltering the reclining grace;
  Here, through the curling smoke, a swarthy face,
  And jewelled turban bound about the head,
  And here the glow
  Of red carnation pressed to lips as warmly red.

  And as they lay in their luxurious ease,
  Playing with grapes and rose-leaves, slim
  And willowy slave-girls, in the hope to please,
  Twisted and danced before them, to the dim
  Uncertain music in the shadows played;
  Some came with supple limb,
  With Mystery's aid
  And snake-like creep,
  Others with riotous leap
  And made festivity to Bacchus wed;
  Others with stiff Egyptian tread,
  And straight black hair hanging in glossy braid,
  They danced, unnoted, and exhausted fled.
         *      *      *      *      *
  Still floated from beneath the acacia-tree
  The droning Eastern music's minor key.


MCMXIII

  SO prodigal was I of youth,
  Forgetting I was young;
  I worshipped dead men for their strength,
  Forgetting I was strong.

  I cherished old, jejune advice;
  I thought I groped for truth;
  Those dead old languages I learned
  When I was prodigal of youth!

  Then in the sunlight stood a boy,
  Outstretching either hand,
  Palm upwards, cup-like, and between
  The fingers trickled sand.

  "Oh, why so grave" he cried to me,
  "Laugh, stern lips, laugh at last!
  Let wisdom come when wisdom may.
  The sand is running fast."

  I followed him into the sun,
  And laughed as he desired,
  And every day upon the grass
  We play till we are tired.



A CREED

  THAT I should live and look with open eyes
  I count as half my claim to Paradise.
  I have not crept beneath cathedral arches,
  But bathed in streams beneath the silver larches;

  And have not grovelled to the Sunday priest,
  But found an unconfined and daily feast;
  Was called ungodly, and to those who blamed
  Laughed back defiance and was not ashamed.

  Some hold their duty to be mournful; why?
  I cannot love your weeping poets; I
  Am sad in winter, but in summer gay,
  And vary with each variable day.

  And though the pious cavilled at my mirth,
  At least I rendered thanks for God's fair earth,
  Grateful that I, among the murmuring rest,
  Was not an unappreciative guest.



TO A POET
WHOSE VERSES I HAD READ

  I WOULD not venture to dispraise or praise.
  Too well I know the indifference which bounds
  A poet in the narrow working-grounds
  Where he is blind and deaf in all his ways.

  He must work out alone his path to glory;
  A thousand breaths are fanning him along;
  A thousand tears end in one little song,
  A thousand conflicts in one little story;

  A thousand notes swell to a single chord.
  He cannot tell where his direction tends;
  He strives unguided towards indefinite ends;
  He is an ignorant though absolute lord.



NOMADS

  FROM the shores of the Atlantic to the gardens of
      Japan,
  From the darkness of the Neva to the courts of
      Ispahan,
  There is nothing that can hold us, hold our wandering
      caravan.

  Leisurely is our encamping; nowhere pause in hasty
      flight.
  Long enough to learn the secret, and the value, and
      the might,
  Whether of the northern mountains or the southern
      lands of light.

  And the riches of the regions will be ours from land to
      land,
  Falling as a wiling booty under our marauding
      hand,
  Rugs from Persia, gods from China, emeralds from
      Samarcand!

  And the old forgotten empires, which have faded turn
      by turn,
  From the shades emerging slowly to their ancient sway
      return,
  And to their imperial manhood rise the ashes from
      the urn.

  We have known Bzyantium's glory when the eagled
      flag was flown,
  When the ruins were not ruins; eagled visions have
      I known
  Of a spectral Roman emperor seated on a spectral
      throne.

  We have tasted space and freedom, frontiers falling as
      we went,
  Now with narrow bonds and limits never could we be
      content,
  For we have abolished boundaries, straitened borders
      have we rent,
  And a house no more confines us than the roving
      nomad's tent.



THE GARDEN

  We owned a garden on a hill,
  We planted rose and daffodil,
  Flowers that English poets sing,
  And hoped for glory in the Spring.

  We planted yellow hollyhocks,
  And humble sweetly-smelling stocks,
  And columbine for carnival,
  And dreamt of Summer's festival.

  And Autumn not to be outdone
  As heiress of the summer sun,
  Should doubly wreathe her tawny head
  With poppies and with creepers red.

  We waited then for all to grow,
  We planted wallflowers in a row.
  And lavendar and borage blue,--
  Alas! we waited, I and you,
  But love was all that ever grew.

THE DANCING ELF*

  I WOKE to daylight, and to find
  A wreath of fading vine-leaves, rough entwined,
  Lying, as dropped in hasty flight, upon my floor.

  Dropped from thy head, sweet Spirit of the night,
  Who cam'st, with footstep light,
  Blown in by the soft breeze, as thistledown,
  In through my open door.
  Whence? From the woodland, from the fields of corn,
  From flirting airily with the bright moon,
  Playing throughout the hours that go too soon,
  Ready to fly at the approach of morn,
  Thou cam'st,
  Bent on the curious quest
  To see what mortal guest
  Dwelt in the one-roomed cottage built to face the
      dawn.

  Thou didst pause
  Shy, timid, on the threshold, though there laughed
  The mischief in thy roguish eyes, then soft,
  Thou crosst the room on tiptoe to my bed,
  One finger on thy lip,
  Cautious to make no slip,
  --I saw the wreath of vine-leaves on thy head.

  Then with a twirl
  Thinking I slept,
  And a joyous whirl,
  Into a dance leapt
  The careless spirit too long restrained;
  The purest dancing,
  Feet sometimes chancing
  To touch the ground;
  Then starting up with a fresh high bound,
  To hang for a moment poised in the air,
  And a glimpse of white teeth glancing
  And a laughing face beneath tossing hair;
  An orgy, a revel, a living joy,
  Embodied in one slim woodland boy,
  Dancing forward, backward, now here, now there,
  Swaying to every impulse unconstrained.

  Thou wert too pure for Bacchus, and too young for
      Pan.
  What wert thou? In the daytime dost thou sleep
  In a cave
  Like a grave,
  Till the moon calls thee, in the sleep of man,
  To thy light revels through the sombre deep
  Wood's shadows to a space among the trees,
  Where the breeze
  Makes music through the branches for thy dance,
  And the large-eyed and silent deer stand round
  Peeping through tree-trunks, and each forest sound
  --The trickling stream's
  Murmur in its dreams,
  The shepherd's pipe, far-echoing by chance,--
  Melt all for thee
  To one soft harmony,
  While for the lighting of thy mossy slope
  The moon thy lover sheds an opal glow,
  Pale silver-green, the colour of the leaves
  Of olive-trees,
  The limelight on the stage for Youth and Joy and
      Hope?
  And at the first rose menace of the dawn
  Must thou go,
  Fly to thy cave, thou little pagan Faun?

  The fount of joy was bubbling in thine eyes,
  Dancing was in thy feet,
  And on thy lips a laugh that never dies,
  Unutterably sweet.
  Dance on! for ever young, for ever fair,
  Lightfooted as a frightened bounding deer,
  Thy wreath of vine-leaves twisted in thy hair,
  Through all the changing seasons of the year,
  And tread, to Autumn's gorgeous hymn of praise,
  And to the happy Spring's light lilt of pleasure,
  And to the dirgeful chant of Winter's days,
  And ever varying, ever suited measure;
  And in the Summer, when the reeking earth
  Swings a vast censer, as it is most meet,
  Praise thou for lavish gifts, new hopes, new birth,
  Praise with the dancing of thy tireless feet!

  I woke to daylight, and to find
  A wreath of fading vine-leaves, rough entwined,
  Lying, as dropped in hasty flight, upon my floor.

CONSTANTINOPLE

DHJI-HAN-GHIR. For H.N.

  FOR years it had been neglected,
  This wilderness garden of ours,
  And its ruin had shone reflected
  In its pools through abandoned hours.
  For none had cared for its beauty
  Till we came, the strangers, the Giaours,
  And none had thought of a duty
  Towards its squandering flowers.

  Of broken wells and fountains
  There were half a dozen or more,
  And, beyond the sea, the mountains
  Of that far Bithynian shore
  Were blue in the purple distance
  And white was the cap they wore,
  And never in our existence
  Had life seemed brighter before!

  And the fruit-trees grew in profusion,
  Quince and pomegranate and wine,
  And the roses in rich confusion
  With the lilac intertwine,
  And the Banksia rose, the creeper,
  Which is golden like yellow wine,
  Is surely more gorgeous and deeper
  In this garden of mine and thine.

  And the little bright flowers in the grasses,
  Cyclamen, daffodil,
  Are crushed by the foot that passes,
  But seem to grow thicker still;
  In the cool grey fig-tree's shadows
  They grow at their own free will,
  In the grass as in English meadows,
  On the slope of an English hill.

  Is it best, when the lone flute-player
  Wanders by with his strange little tune
  And the muezzin sings out for prayer
  Thrice daily his Arabic rune:
  Once, when the sunset has faded,
  Once in the brilliant noon,
  Or once in the daybreak, rose-shaded.
  A farewell to the dying moon?



LEBLEBIDJI*

  I KNOW so well the busy cries
  That echo through the quarter
  Till daylight into evening dies
  And stars shine in the water,
  So dear they have become to me,
  Leblebidji! leblebidji!

  On peaceful English country nights
  Their rapid gay succession
  And all the sea-reflected lights
  Will pass from my possession,
  But never from my memory,
  Leblebidji! leblebidji!

  Past English evening scents and sounds,
  Past English church-bells ringing,
  The Turkish watchman on his rounds,
  The Turkish pedlar singing
  Through narrow streets above the sea
  "Leblebidji! leblebidji,"

  Will surely pierce a ghostly way,
  The music underlying,
  And in the shades of falling day
  As in the distance dying,
  A little call will come to me,
  "Leblebidji!" ...

* Little white beans



THE MUEZZIN

  ABOVE the city at his feet,
  Above the dome, above the sea,
  He rises unconfined and free
  To break upon the noonday heat.

  He turns around the parapet,
  Black-robed against the marble tower;
  His singing gains or loses power
  In pacing round the minaret.

  A brother to the singing birds
  He never knew restraining walls,
  But freely rises, freely falls
  The rhythm of the sacred words.

  I would that it to me were given
  To climb each day the muezzin's stair
  And in the warm and silent air
  To sing my heart out into Heaven.



THE GREEK HAN

  A SUNNY court with wooden balconies,
  And wool hung out to dry in gaudy skeins,
  A fountain, and some pigeons murmuringly
  Picking up yellow grains.

  Pass through a little tumble-down green door
  Into the dark and crowded shop; the Turk
  Crouching above the brasier, smiles and nods;
  'Tis all his daily work.

  Here marble heads and alabaster jars,
  Fragments of porphyry and Persian tiles,
  Lie heaped in ruin, and at our dismay
  The old Turk shrugs and smiles,

  And sips his coffee, reaching out a hand
  To throw upon the brasier at his feet
  A handful of dried herbs, whose sudden smoke
  Rises up incense-sweet.



YANGHIN VAR*

  AS the baying of wolves from afar,
  Borne on the wind from the Golden Horn
  A cry in the distance, long-drawn,
  "Yanghin var! yanghin var!"

  Suddenly waking the silent night,
  Suddenly breaking the sleeping calm,
  The long, far, wailing alarm,
  And the watch-tower startles a warning light.

  As a torch passed from hand to hand,
  As a beacon springing from hill to hill,
  The cry draws nearer though distant still,
  And the watch throws it on from stand to stand,

  And the voices rise as a tempest far,
  As the swell of waves on a rocky shore,
  Each rumbles louder than before,
  "Yanghin var! yanghin var!"

  And as the angel's unpausing feet,
  The angel bearing the wrath of the Lord,
  The angel bearing the flaming sword,
  The voice passes onward below in the street.

  Faintly it travels again from afar,
  And as an echo of terror past
  The wind from the Bosphorus bears the last
  Yanghin var. ...

* Fire!



MORNING IN CONSTANTINOPLE

  SHE has an early morning of her own,
  A blending of the mist and sea and sun
  Into an undistinguishable one,
  And Saint Sophia, from her lordly throne

  Rises above the opalescent cloud,
  A shadowy dome and soaring minaret
  Visable though the base be hidden yet
  Beneath the veiling wreaths of milky shroud,

  As some dark Turkish beauty haughtily
  Glances above the yashmak's snowy fold.
  --Beyond Stamboul's long stretch, a bar of gold
  Falls from the sun across the distant sea.



RETOUR EN SONGE

  AFTER a dream-dim voyage
  We came with sails all set
  Towards the city of the sea,
  And it was wonderful to me
  To find her reigning yet.

  Oh beauty that my eyes and heart
  Had feasted on before!
  The evening mosques were brushed with gold,
  The water lapped a lazy fold
  Upon that lovely shore;

  The gardens of her terraced hills
  Rose up above the port,
  And little houses half concealed
  The presence of a light revealed,
  And here my journey's end was sealed,
  And I reached the home I sought.

  Those windows I had opened wide
  To welcome in the sun!
  Those stairs that only happy feet
  Had measured with their running beat!
  That well-remembered winding street!
  Twelve months that were as one!

  Should others with their sordid cares
  And troubles enter here?
  Love hung about the rooms like smoke,
  And peace descended as a cloak,
  Should I allow the vulgar folk
  To desecrate that year?

  --I laid the fuse with steady hand;
  We sailed into the night,
  From deck I watched the flames arise
  Remorseless as my tearless eyes
  That, with the waves and reddened skies,
  Flung back the angry light.



CONSTANTINOPLE, MARCH MCMXV

  I
  QUEEN of a double empire still she stands,
  And watches with superb indifferent eyes
  The eager wooing of Imperial hands
  Towards so fair and coveted a prize.

  Royal and imperial suitors has she known
  Pass one by one across her dreaming years,
  And some a while have climbed the golden throne,
  And some have passed away in blood and tears;

  For many emperors have sought her grace
  Since the first Constantine in sweeping cloak
  Her seven hills with broad unhurrying pace
  Measured, and rested not till Heaven spoke.

  A haughty fatalist Byzantium waits
  What chance the storing centuries bring forth:
  Another lover almost at the gates,
  Heralded by the cannon of the North,

  A Northern King to wed the Eastern Queen,
  An iron clasp to set the shining gem,
  Thrice-changed Constantinople to be seen
  The Jewel of a Russian diadem!

  II
  O Saint Sophia, where the footstep falls
  Softly beneath the roofs of burnished gold,
  Shields of the Caliphs hang upon thy walls,
  Brand of bereaved dishonour ages old.

  His charger raised on Christian corpses high,
  --O ravished bride of Christianity!--
  Here struck Mahomet's hand as he rode by,
  And seared the lustre of the porphyry,

  And, interrupted in the sacred feast,
  Hearing the advent of the conqueror surge,
  Into the wall miraculous the priest
  Entered, and waits the summons to emerge.

  So on that high and ceremonial day
  When Russian Czar and prince, and Christian lord
  Throng Saint Sophia in their packed array
  To see the church's heritage restored,

  When from mosaics re-established saints
  Look down once more upon a Christian crowd,
  And Echo startles into life, and faints
  With rapture at Gregorian chanting loud,

  And Mass magnificently moving on
  Towards its climax, brings the moment near
  After the lapse of many centuries gone
  For Christ in priestly hands to reappear,

  When the exultant organ's chord has ceased
  And every head is bowed expectantly,
  --Then at the altar the Byzantine priest
  Shall hold aloft the Host triumphantly!



RESOLUTION

  I SEE the work of others, and my heart
  Sinks as my own achievement I compare.
  --I will not be irresolute, nor despair,
  But battle strongly for my struggling art

  Convinced against conviction that my part
  Equally with my masters I can bear;
  Although their monuments are very fair,
  Enriched with statues, and I stand apart

  And gaze upon my little heap of stones
  Which I was given to build with, very few
  As yet laid into place, but I will lay

  --Blind to these marble monuments and thrones,
  Building as though I confidently knew
  My ultimate end,--a stone in place each day.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
