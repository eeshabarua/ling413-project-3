[Illustration: {A mountain scene}]


The Hill People.

    Their steps are light and exceedingly fleet:
    They pass me by in the hurrying street.

    I pause to look at a window's show--
    From the white-flecked alp the hill winds blow--

    And all at once it has passed me there,
    Lilting back to the land of the air,

    Back to the land of the great white stills:
    Is it only the wind that comes down from the hills?

           *       *       *       *       *

    Was it Pikes Peak Pixie or Cheyenne Shee
    That whispered a gay little rhyme to me?

    Or a gnome that lives in the heart of a stone
    And dances at dawn around Cameron's Cone?

    Did the haunting laugh of the Maid of the Corn,
    An Aztec memory trill on the morn?

    Or soft did the Navajo Shell-Woman speak
    As she passed with a hymn for the great white peak?

           *       *       *       *       *

    They touch me light with their finger tips
    And lay little snatches of song on my lips,

    And swift I am gone where the hill-streams flow,
    Where the pit-lark soars and the gentians blow.

    The tapers of blossoms flame under the tree
    And the pilgrim road unfolds for me,

    Lifting away where the hill-folk keep
    The gardens and cloisters and shrines of the Steep.

           *       *       *       *       *

    In charmed ways my feet are set:
    By what fair host is the palmer met

    And borne away to the great white stills?
    Is it only the wind that comes down from the hills?




[Illustration: Colorado Columbine]


Columbine in the Hills.

    A carnival gladdens the hills in June,
    And Columbine waltzes a gypsy tune;
    Or deep in the pleasance, happily met,
    She whirls with a gay little pirouette,
    Where the long trees lean in a twilight trance,
    Dreaming her over the seas to France.

        Or quiet under the aspen's shade,
        Misty-eyed little pensive maid,
        Musing under the Great Steep's tree,
        Is it for Pierrot?--where is he?

    A flutter of petticoats, buff and blue,
    Sashes and streamers and holiday tire,
    Columbine trips her a measure for you,
    Gayest heart of the waltzing choir.
    Under the pines I saw her dance,
    Lilting a gay little tune of France.




[Illustration: Small-leaved Saxifrage]


Saxifrage.

    The wide, wide sky was a crystal clear,
    A great blue dome that quivered near.

    And oh, the white-flowered miracle grown
    Out of the broad gray breast of a stone!

    Little plant, did you guess that when I heard
    You whisper your one sweet rune-telling word,

    Straight into the crystal I could see,
    And the Heart of the Sky leaned down to me?




[Illustration: Alpine Forget-me-not]


Alpine Forget-Me-Not.

    Before earth's dawn hour thought to wane,
    Where Paradise leaned over Iran's plain,
    A man god looked from his templed fane
      On a maiden wondrously fair:
    He saw her first in the Cashmere's danks,
    Singing at dawn by a river's banks,
    Where the long grass leaned to her, ranks on ranks,
      Forget-me-nots twined in her hair.

    O night of sorrow in Cashmere's fen--
    For a god may not wed with a maid of men--
    Driven in wrath was the man god then
      From the genii's holy mirth,
    Till the river-maid's hand shall scatter and pour
    The seeds of the little blue flowers she wore,
    From the happy lintels of heaven's own door
      To the uttermost ends of the earth.

    The Great Steep's Garden is musked and fair:
    Araby-sweet is the spice on the air:
    Ah, softly tread, have gentle care,
      Love's handmaid has passed this way.
    Did the long miles fret or the red suns beat?
    Did the great stones tear at her little white feet?
    Did the storm winds harry with stinging sleet,
      Or the mad seas bid her stay?

    Ah, Allah is great; but Love is great
    When the woman-heart needs make atoning and wait:
    She has led him back to the crystal gate,--
      Together they entered there.
    The Great Steep's Garden is musked today:
    The spices of Araby over it lay,
    For Love's handmaiden has passed this way,
      Forget-me-nots tressed in her hair.




[Illustration: Indian Paint Brush]


Indian Paint Brush.

    Brave bold warrior, standing afar
    On the summit place where the wind-torn pine
    At the battle front of the timberline
    Knows never an end of the harrowing war
    Of Life on Death!--and there arrayed
    In the trappings of battle and unafraid,
    Painted and feathered in hostile design,
    Indian chief on the marching line!




[Illustration: Arctic Gentian]


Arctic Gentian.

    Beyond the reach of the timberline,
      The long trail lifting, lifting,
    Past wizened gardens of low gaunt pine,
    Crouching out of the great storm's path:
    The last tree flees from the arctic wrath,
      But on is the white trail lifting.

    Cities and rivers and fields beseem
      A fantasy, fading, fading,
    Lost away in the myth of a dream:
    And the wide land reaches beyond our eyes,
    A Navajo carpet of strange soft dyes:
    Patterned with cities the great web lies,
      Woven with fantasies, fading.

    Rolls in the tide and the cloud waves toss,
      The reach of the long land merging:
    Where the still white surges part and cross
    The quivering vistas seem to be
    Of a lost land under the waves of a sea.
    O summit flower, what strange waves toss
      Below in the long, long surging!




[Illustration: Alpine Primrose]


Alpine Primrose.

    Happy Heart coming home from the far, far hills,
    How the primrose flamed in the arctic chills!
    And you heard the flutes of the summit birds:
    You will keep forever their sky-lost words,
    Happy Heart coming home from the hills.

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
