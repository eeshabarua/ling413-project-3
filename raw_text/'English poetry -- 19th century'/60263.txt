VERSES.


THE NIGHT.


  Most holy Night, that still dost keep
  The keys of all the doors of sleep,
  To me when my tired eyelids close
          Give thou repose.

  And let the far lament of them
  That chaunt the dead day’s requiem
  Make in my ears, who wakeful lie,
          Soft lullaby.

  Bid them that guard the sacred moon
  By my bedside their memories croon;
  So shall I have strange dreams and blest
          In my brief rest.

  Fold thy great wings about my face,
  Hide day-dawn from my resting-place,
  And cheat me with thy false delight,
          Most holy Night.


HOMAGE.


  I.

  There is a light around your head
  Which only Saints of God may wear,
  And all the flowers on which you tread
  In pleasaunce more than ours have fed,
  And supped the essential air
  Whose summer is a-pulse with music everywhere.

  II.

  For you are younger than the mornings are
  That in the mountains break;
  When upland shepherds see their only star
  Pale on the dawn, and make
  In his surcease the hours,
  The early hours of all their happy circuit take.


CUCKOO!

  In woods so long time bare.
    Cuckoo!
  (Up in Mortain woods, I know not where)
  Two notes fall.
  Yet I do not envy him at all
  His phantasy.
  Cuckoo!
  I too,
  Somewhere,
  I have sang as merrily as he
  Who can dare,
  Small and careless lover, so to laugh at care,
  And who
  Can call
  Cuckoo!
  In woods of winter weary,
  In scented woods, of winter weary, call
  Cuckoo!
  In woods so long time bare.




SONNETS.


THE HARBOUR.

  I was like one who grips the deck by night,
    Bearing the tiller up against his breast;
  I was like one who makes with all his might
    For keeping course although so hardly prest;
    Who veers with veering shock, now east, now west,
  And strains his foothold still, and still makes play,
    Of bending beams until the sacred light
  Shows him high lands and heralds up the day.

  But now such busy work of battle past,
  I am like one whose barque at bar at last
  Comes hardly heeling down the adventurous breeze,
  And entering calmer seas,
  I am like one that brings his merchandise
  To Californian skies.


HER YOUTH.

  Youth gave you to me, but I’ll not believe
    That youth will, taking his quick self, take you.
  Youth’s all our truth; he cannot so deceive;
    He has our graces--not our own selves too.
  He still compares with time when he’ll be spent,
    By human fate enhancing what we are;
  Enriches us with dear experiment,
    Lends arms to leaguered age in Time’s rough war.

  Look, this youth in us is an old man taking
    A boy to make him wiser than his days.
  So is our old youth our young ages making,
    So rich in time his final debt he pays.
  So with your quite young arms do you me hold,
  And I will still be young when all the world’s grown old.


LOVE AND HONOUR.

  Love wooing Honour, Honour’s love did win,
    And had his pleasure all a summer’s day.
  Not understanding how the dooms begin,
    Love wooing Honour, wooed her life away.
  Then wandered he for full five years’ unrest,
    Until, one night, this Honour that had died
    Came as he woke, in youth grown glorified,
  And smiling like the saints whom God has blest.

  But when he saw her in the dear night shine
    Serene, with more than mortal light upon her,
  The boy that careless was of things divine,
    Small Love, turned penitent to worship Honour.
  So Love can conquer Honour; when that’s past,
  Dead Honour risen outdoes Love at last.


HER MUSIC.

  Oh! do not play me music any more,
    Lest in us mortal, some not mortal spell
    Should stir strange hopes, and leave a tale to tell
  Of two belovéd whom holy music bore,
    Through whispering night and doubt’s uncertain seas,
  To drift at length along a dawnless shore,
    The last sad goal of human harmonies.
  Look! do not play me music any more.

  You are my music and my mistress both,
    Why, then, let music play the master here?
  Make silent melody, Melodie. I am loath
    To find that music, large in my soul’s ear,
  Should stop my fancy, hold my heart in prize,
  And make me dreamer more than dreams are wise.


HER FAITH.

  Because my faltering feet will fail to dare
    The downward of the endless steps of Hell,
  Give me the word in time that triumphs there.

    I too must go into the dreadful hollow,
  Where all our human laughter stops--and hark!
  The tiny stuffless voices of the dark
    Have called me, called me till I needs must follow.

  Give me the word, and I’ll attempt it well.

  Say it’s the little winking of an eye,
    Which in that issue is uncurtained quite.
  A little sleep that helps a moment by
    Between the thin dawn and the large daylight.
  Oh! tell me more than yet was hoped of men,
  Swear that’s true now, and I’ll believe it then.


HER GIFT IN A GARDEN.

  Not for the luckless buds our roots may bear,
  Now quite in bloom, now seared and cankered lying,
  Will I entreat you, lest they should compare
    My sad mortality with the fall of flowers;
  But hold with me your chaste communion rare,
    And touch with life this mortal case of ours.
  For you were born beyond the power of dying:
  I die as bounded things die everywhere.

  You’re full companionship, I’m silence lonely;
    You’re stuff, I’m void; you’re living, I’m decay.
  I fall, I think, to twilight ending only,
    You lift, I know, to never-ending day.
  And knowing living gift was life for me,
  In narrow room of rhyme, I fixed it certainly.


THE CHECK.

  Shall any man for whose dear love another
    Has thrown away his wealth and name in one,
  Shall he turn scoffer of a more than brother,
    To mock his needs when his desires are done?
  Or shall a low-born boy whose mother won him
    In great men great concerns his little place,
  Turn, when his farthing honours come upon him,
    To note her yeoman air and conscious grace?

  Then mock me as you do my narrow scope,
    For you it was put out this light of mine,
  Traitrously wrecked my new adventured hope,
    Wasted my wordy wealth, spilt my rich wine,
  Made my square ship within a league of shore,
  Alas! to be entombed in seas and seen no more.


THE POOR OF LONDON.

  Almighty God, whose Justice, like a sun
    Shall coruscate along the floors of heaven:
  Raising what’s low, perfecting what’s undone,
    Breaking the proud, and making odd things even.
  The Poor of Jesus Christ along the street
    In your rain sodden, in your snows unshod,
  They have nor hearth, nor roof, nor daily meat,
    Nor even the bread of men; Almighty God.

  The Poor of Jesus Christ whom no man hears
    Have called upon your vengeance much too long.
  Wipe out not tears but blood: our eyes bleed tears:
    Come, smite our damnéd sophistries so strong,
    That thy rude hammer battering this rude wrong
  Ring down the abyss of twice ten thousand years.




GROTESQUES.


NOËL.

  I.

  On a winter’s night long time ago
  (_The bells ring loud and the bells ring low_),
  When high howled wind, and down fell snow
          (Carillon, Carilla).
  Saint Joseph he and Nostre Dame,
  Riding on an ass, full weary came
  From Nazareth into Bethlehem.
      And the small child Jesus smile on you.

  II.

  And Bethlehem inn they stood before
  (_The bells ring less and the bells ring more_),
  The landlord bade them begone from his door
          (Carillon, Carilla).
  “Poor folk” (says he) “must lie where they may,
  For the Duke of Jewry comes this way,
  With all his train on a Christmas Day.”
      And the small child Jesus smile on you.

  III.

  Poor folk that may my carol hear
  (_The bells ring single and the bells ring clear_),
  See! God’s one Child had hardest cheer!
          (Carillon, Carilla).
  Men grown hard on a Christmas morn;
  The dumb beast by and a babe forlorn.
  It was very, very cold when our Lord was born.
      And the small child Jesus smile on you.

  IV.

  Now these were Jews as Jews must be
  (_The bells ring wild and the bells ring free!_),
  But Christian men in a band are we
          (Carillon, Carilla).
  Empty we go and ill bedight,
  Singing Noël on a winter’s night;
  Give us to sup by the warm firelight.
      And the small child Jesus smile on you.


THE EARLY MORNING.

  The Moon on the one hand, the Dawn on the other;
  The Moon is my sister, the Dawn is my brother.
  The Moon on my left, and the Dawn on my right;
  My Brother, good morning; my Sister, good night.


AUVERGNAT.

  There was a man was half a clown
      (It’s so, my father tells of it),
  He saw the church in Clermont Town,
      And laughed to hear the bells of it.

  He laughed to hear the bells that ring
      In Clermont Church and round of it;
  He heard the verger’s daughter sing,
      And loved her for the sound of it.

  The verger’s daughter said him nay
      (She had the right of choice in it);
  He left the town at break of day
      (He hadn’t had a voice in it).

  The road went up, the road went down,
      And there the matter ended it;
  He broke his heart in Clermont Town,
      At Pontgibaud they mended it.


THE WORLD’S END.

  The clouds are high and the skies are wide
    (_It’s a weary way to the world’s end_).
  I hear the wind upon a hillside
    (_Over the hills, away_).

  Over the hills and over the sea
    (_It’s a weary way to the world’s end_).
  The woman alone is a-calling me
    (_Over the hills, away_).

  Beyond the rim of the rising moon
    (_It’s a weary way to the world’s end_).
  He’s back too late who starts too soon
    (_Over the hills, away_).

  He’s wise, and he laughs who loves to roam
    (_It’s a weary way to the world’s end_);
  He’s wise and he cries the when he comes home
    (_Over the hills, away_).

  Woman alone, and all alone
    (_It’s a weary way to the world’s end_).
  I’ll just be sitting at home, my own,
    The world’s a weary way.


FILLE-LA-HAINE.

  Death went into the steeple to ring,
    And he pulled the rope and he tolled a knell.
  Fille-la-Haine, how well you sing!
    Why are they ringing the Passing Bell?
  _Death went into the steeple to ring;
  Fille-la-Haine, how well you sing!_

  Death went down the stream in a boat,
    Down the river of Seine went he;
  Fille-la-Haine had a pain in her throat,
    Fille-la-Haine was nothing to me.
  _Death went down the stream in a boat;
  Fille-la-Haine had a pain in her throat._

  Death went up the hill in a cart
    (I have forgotten her lips and her laughter).
  Fille-la-Haine was my sweetheart
    (And all the village was following after).
  _Death went up the hill in a cart;
  Fille-la-Haine was my sweetheart._


THE MOON’S FUNERAL.

  The Moon is dead. I saw her die.
  She in a drifting cloud was drest,
  She lay along the uncertain west,
  A dream to see.
  And very low she spake to me:
  “I go where none may understand,
  I fade into the nameless land,
  And there must lie perpetually.”
  And therefore I,
  And therefore loudly, loudly I
  And high
  And very piteously make cry:
  “The Moon is dead. I saw her die.”
  And will she never rise again?
  The Holy Moon? Oh, never more!
  Perhaps along the inhuman shore
  Where pale ghosts are
  Beyond the far lethean fen
  She and some wide infernal star--
  To us who loved her never more,
  The Moon will never rise again.
  Oh! never more in nightly sky
  Her eye so high shall peep and pry
  To see the great world rolling by.
  For why?
  The Moon is dead. I saw her die.


THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE.

  Distinguish carefully between these two,
    This thing is yours, that other thing is mine.
  You have a shirt, a brimless hat, a shoe
    And half a coat. I am the Lord benign
  Of fifty hundred acres of fat land
  To which I have a right. You understand?

  I have a right because I have, because,
    Because I have--because I have a right.
  Now be quite calm and good, obey the laws,
    Remember your low station, do not fight
  Against the goad, because, you know, it pricks
  Whenever the uncleanly demos kicks.

  I do not envy you your hat, your shoe.
    Why should you envy me my small estate?
  It’s fearfully illogical in you
    To fight with economic force and fate.
  Moreover, I have got the upper hand,
  And mean to keep it. Do you understand?




EPIGRAMS.


ON PERKINS--AN ACTOR.

  Perkins’ Duchesses have marked a great
  Improvement in his coster scene of late.
  He gives the oath, the drunken lurch, the roar,
  As even Perkins never did before.
  And yet, the model is not far to seek--
  Perkins was visiting at home last week.


ON SLOP--A POET.

  Where Mr. Slop particularly shines
  Is in his six sonorous single lines.
  Perhaps where he is less successful is
  In all the other verses. These are his.


ON TORTURE--A SINGER.

  Torture has such an ear, I understand
  He pays large sums to stop a German Band.
  The public taste is quite a different thing,
  Torture is positively paid to sing.


ON SUBTLE--A REVIEWER.

  Subtle--your keen analysis and nice,
  Like everything about you, has its price.
  When you express your owner’s private spite
  A Pound rewards the virulence you write.
  A Pound should therefore buy your praise; well, then,
  Why should the Author have to pay you ten?


ON PAUNCH--A PARASITE.

  Paunch talks about his Lady to excess,
  And then about his curious Patroness,
  And then he talks about himself, and then
  We turn the conversation on to men.


ON PUGLEY--A DON.

  Pugley denies the soul? Why, so do I
  The soul, of Pugley, heartily deny.




SONNETS OF THE TWELVE MONTHS.


JANUARY.

  It freezes. All across a soundless sky
      The birds go home. The horrible dark’s begun:
      The frozen dark that hopes not for a sun;
  The ultimate dark wherein our race shall die.

      Death, with his evil finger to his lip,
  Leers in at human windows, turning spy
  To learn the country where his rule shall lie
      When he achieves perpetual generalship.

      The undefeated enemy--the chill--
  Which shall benumb the voiceful earth at last,
      Is master of our moment, and has bound
      The viewless wind itself. There is no sound.
  It freezes. Every friendly stream is fast.
      It freezes; and the graven twigs are still.


FEBRUARY.

  The winter moon has such a quiet car
      That all the winter nights are dumb with rest;
      She drives the gradual dark with drooping crest,
  And dreams go wandering from her drowsy star.
  Because her star is silent do not wake:
      But there shall tremble on the general earth,
      And over you, a quickening and a birth,
  The sun is near the hill-tops for your sake.

      The latest born of all the days shall creep,
    To kiss the tender eyelids of the year,
      And you shall wake, grown young with perfect sleep,
    And smile at the new world, and make it dear
      With living murmurs more than dreams are deep.
    Silence is dead, my Dawn; the morning’s here.


MARCH.

  The north-east wind has come from Norroway,
      Roaring he came above the white waves’ tips!
      The foam of the loud sea was on his lips,
  And all his hair was salt with falling spray.
  Over the keen light of northern day
      He cast his snow cloud’s terrible eclipse;
      Beyond our banks he suddenly struck the ships,
  And left them labouring on his landward way.

    The certain course that to his strength belongs
    Drives him with gathering purpose and control
        Until across Vendean flats he sees
        Ocean, the eldest of his enemies.
    Then wheels he for him, glorying in his goal,
    And gives him challenge, bellowing battle-songs.


APRIL.

  The stranger warmth of the young sun obeying,
      Look! little heads of green begin to grow,
      And hidden flowers have dared their tops to show
  Where late such droughty dusts were rudely playing.
  It’s not the month, but all the world’s a-maying!
      Come then with me, I’ll take you, for I know
      Where the first hedgethorns and white windflowers blow:
  We two alone, that goes without the saying.

  The month has treacherous clouds and moves in fears.
    This April shames the month itself with smiles:
  In whose new eyes I know no heaven of tears,
    But still serene desire and between whiles,
  So great a look that even April’s grace
  Makes only marvel at her only face.


MAY.

  This is the laughing-eyed amongst them all:
      My lady’s month. A season of young things.
      She rules the light with harmony, and brings
  The year’s first green upon the beeches tall.
  How often, where long creepers wind and fall
      Through the deep woods in noonday wanderings,
      I’ve heard the month, when she to echo sings,
  I’ve heard the month make merry madrigal.

    How often, bosomed in the breathing strong
      Of mosses and young flowerets, have I lain
    And watched the clouds, and caught the sheltered song--
      Which it were more than life to hear again--
    Of those small birds that pipe it all day long
      Not far from Marly by the memoried Seine.


JUNE.

  Rise up, and do begin the day’s adorning;
    The Summer dark is but the dawn of day.
  The last of sunset grows into the morning,
    The morning calls you from the dark away.
  The holy mist, the white mist of the morning,
    Was wreathing upward on my lonely way.
  My way was waiting for your own adorning,
    That should complete the broad adornéd day.

    Rise up, and do begin the day’s adorning;
  The little eastern clouds are dapple-gray,
  There will be wind among the leaves to-day;
    It is the very promise of the morning.
  _Lux tua via mea._ Your light’s my way:
  Oh, do rise up and make it perfect day.


JULY.

  The Kings come riding back from the Crusade,
    The purple Kings and all their mounted men;
  They fill the street with clamorous cavalcade;
    The Kings have broken down the Saracen.
  Singing a great song of the eastern wars,
    In crimson ships across the sea they came,
  With crimson sails and diamonded dark oars,
    That made the Mediterranean flash with flame.

  And reading how, in that far month, the ranks
    Formed on the edge of the desert, armoured all,
      I wish to God that I had been with them
    When the first Norman leapt upon the wall,
  And Godfrey led the foremost of the Franks,
      And young Lord Raymond stormed Jerusalem.


AUGUST.

  The soldier month, the bulwark of the year,
    That never more shall hear such victories told;
  He stands apparent with his heaven-high spear,
    And helmeted of grand Etruscan gold.
  Our harvest is the bounty he has won,
    The loot his fiery temper takes by strength.
  Oh! Paladin of the Imperial sun!
    Oh! crown of all the seasons come at length!

  This is sheer manhood; this is Charlemagne,
    When he with his wide host came conquering home
  From vengeance under Roncesvalles ta’en.
    Or when his bramble beard flaked red with foam
  Of bivouac wine-cups on the Lombard plain,
    What time he swept to grasp the world at Rome.


SEPTEMBER.

  I, from a window where the Meuse is wide,
    Looked eastward out to the September night;
  The men that in the hopeless battle died
    Rose, and deployed, and stationed for the fight;
  A brumal army, vague and ordered large
    For mile on mile by some pale general;
  I saw them lean by companies to the charge,
    But no man living heard the bugle-call.

  And fading still, and pointing to their scars,
    They fled in lessening cloud, where gray and high
  Dawn lay along the heaven in misty bars;
    But watching from that eastern casement, I
    Saw the Republic splendid in the sky,
  And round her terrible head the morning stars.


OCTOBER.

  Look, how those steep woods on the mountain’s face
    Burn, burn against the sunset; now the cold
    Invades our very noon: the year’s grown old,
  Mornings are dark, and evenings come apace.
  The vines below have lost their purple grace,
    And in Forrèze the white wrack backward rolled,
    Hangs to the hills tempestuous, fold on fold,
  And moaning gusts make desolate all the place.

  Mine host the month, at thy good hostelry,
    Tired limbs I’ll stretch and steaming beast I’ll tether;
  Pile on great logs with Gascon hand and free,
    And pour the Gascon stuff that laughs at weather;
  Swell your tough lungs, north wind, no whit care we,
    Singing old songs and drinking wine together.


NOVEMBER.

  November is some historied Emperor,
    Conquered in age, but foot to foot with fate,
  Who from his refuge high has caught the roar
    Of squadrons in pursuit, and now, too late,
  Stirrups the storm and calls the winds to war,
    And arms the garrison of his last heir-loom,
  And shakes the sky to its extremest shore
    With battle against irrevocable doom.

  Till, driven and hurled from his strong citadels,
    He flies in hurrying cloud; and spurs him on
  Empty of lingerings, empty of farewells
    And final benedictions, and is gone.
  But in my garden all the trees have shed
  Their legacies of the light, and all the flowers are dead.


DECEMBER.

  Hoar Time about the house betakes him slow,
    Seeking an entry for his weariness;
    And in that dreadful company, Distress
  And the sad Night with silent footsteps go.
  On my poor hearth the brands are scarce aglow,
    And in the woods without pale wanderers press;
    Where, waning in the pines from less to less,
  Mysterious hangs the hornéd moon, and low.

  For now December, full of aged care,
    Comes in upon the year and weakly grieves,
  Mumbling his lost desires and his despair;
    And with mad, trembling hand still interweaves
  The dank sear flower-stalks tangled in his hair,
    While round about him whirl the rotten leaves.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work

phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
