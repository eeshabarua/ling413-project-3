The MONKEY'S FROLIC.


  Our tale is a true one, from which may be taught
  A maxim for youth, with utility fraught;--
 _If terrors assail you, examine the cause,
  And all will be well_;--for, by NATURE'S kind laws,
  Nor Goblins nor Spectres on earth have a station,--
  These phantoms are all of ideal creation.

[Illustration]

  A _Monkey_, that comical tricks would be at,
  His frolics one morning began with the _Cat_;
  He chatter'd, as much as to say _How d' ye do?_
  And _Puss_ look'd her thanks, and politely cried _Mew_!
 _Pug_ then shook her paw, and they sat down together,
 _Puss_ washing her face, indicating wet weather.

[Illustration]

  But, mischief the _Monkey_ inclining to harbour,
  His skill he resolved now to try as a _Barber_.--
  A soap-box conveniently lay in the room,
  "Miss _Puss_," he exclaim'd, "you'll be shaved, I presume?"
  Then scraping and bowing with grin and grimace,
  Despite of resistance, he lather'd her face.

[Illustration]

  Now _Pug_ could not find either razor or knife,
  So _Puss_ ran no hazard of losing her life;--
  Yet razor or knife though they could not be had,
 _Pug_ found what the terrified _Cat_ thought as bad;
  A knife made of ivory, in use to cut paper,
  With which Barber _Pug_ now proceeded to scrape her.

[Illustration]

  But _Puss_ on a sudden deserted her station,
  Disliking (no wonder) the strange operation,
  And ran round the room without means of escaping;
  While _Pug_, still determined to give her a scraping,
  Pursued, and, regardless of struggle or prayer,
  Fast bound her, at last, to the back of a chair.

[Illustration]

  When, tucking a napkin close under her chin,
  Each mew of dismay he return'd with a grin;
  And yelling and chattering they raised such a clatter,
  That _Susan_ rush'd in to learn what was the matter;
  When _Pug_, overturning the chair midst the clack,
  Ran off, leaving _Pussy_ stretched out on her back.

[Illustration]

  The sight was to _Susan_ so curious, that faster
  She ran _out_ than _in_, to tell _Mistress_ and _Master_;
  But, when they came up, neither _Puss_ nor the _Shaver_
  Was there, to account for improper behaviour;--
  For _Pug_ had contrived, amid _Susan's_ alarms,
  To reach the house-top, with Miss _Puss_ in his arms.

[Illustration]

  Now fearing that _Pug_ or Miss _Puss_ might be maim'd,
  "Go, fetch a long ladder," the _Master_ exclaim'd;
  "And bring them down quickly both _Barber_ and _Cat_."
  "Oh, oh!" thought the _Monkey_, "I _sha'nt suffer that_."--
  The ladder was climb'd by a servant so valiant,
  But _Pug_ with loose tiles soon repulsed the assailant.

[Illustration]

  Against all manoeuvre apparently proof,
 _Pug_ chatter'd and paced to and fro on the roof,
  And fondled the _Cat_, and next, pitying her case,
  He wiped with the napkin the suds from her face;
  As nurse would a child, then he held her out _so_,
  While all the spectators kept laughing below.

[Illustration]

  Now seeing him thus to good humour inclined,
  They thought he might prove more pacific of mind,
  So mounted the ladder another assailer;
  When _Pug_, of loose tiles now perceiving a failure,
  Eluded the grasp of pursuit with a hop,
  And gained an adjacent and tall chimney-pot.

[Illustration]

  It chanced that the vent of this same chimney led
  Direct to a chamber, confined to his bed
  Where lay an old gentleman, ill with the gout,
 _And wishing some bad fate might thence drag him out!_
 _Pug_, missing his footing, 'midst vapour and fume,
  That instant with _Puss_ tumbled into the room.

[Illustration]

  Grimed over with soot, they kick'd up such a rout,
  And caper'd the sick man's apartment about,
  And chatter'd and squall'd in a manner so hideous,
  Like young imps of darkness, that, not to be tedious,
  The sufferer forgot both his gout and his prayers,
  And scamper'd, pursued by these phantoms, down stairs!

[Illustration]

  There sat in the parlour a medical man,
  And thither _pursued_ and _pursuers_ now ran;--
  And _Puss_ and the _Monkey_ grown fiercer and bolder,
  Physician and Patient seized each by his shoulder,
  Who raised such a yell, that the _chorus_ resembled
  A legion of mad-caps from Bedlam assembled!

[Illustration]

  The tumult each wonder-struck inmate alarm'd;
  At length on assistance they ventured, well arm'd,
  And entered the scene of dismay and despair,--
  When, lo! no invaders of quiet were there!
  But Doctor and Patient lay stretch'd on the floor,
  Not wotting of terror a forthcoming cure.

[Illustration]

  The incident soon was of mystery clear'd,--
  The owner of _Pug_ and _Grimalkin_ appear'd;--
  "My _Monkey_ and _Cat_ have created alarm;
  I hope," he observed, "you have not taken harm:"--
  Then cautiously peering the chamber about,
  He dragg'd, from the Chimney, both intruders out.

[Illustration]

  Alarm now gave way to good humour and fun,--
  "Much harm to my friend," said the Patient, "is done;
  Your _Ape_ pill and potion has put to the rout,
  And cured me, I thank him, at once of the _Gout_."
  He then to the _Monkey_ made reverence profound,
  Who _salam'd_ politely the company round.

[Illustration]

  The _Doctor_ a lesson thus learn'd, that, despite
  Of physic, the Gout may be cured by a _fright_:
  And, since this affair, now and then on the sly
  In similar cases same means he will try.--
  To show that no malice or envy he knew,
  He shook hands with _Pug_, and each party withdrew.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
