                             SIMPLE POEMS,

         THE SAIL-BOAT.


    Oh, see our little boat,
      How prettily it glides;
    Like a bird it seems to float,
      Press’d forward by the tides,
                    By the tides.

    The sky is shining brightly,
      The fishes dart below,
    While our little boat so lightly
      Leaps onward as we go--
                      As we go.

    I would like to be a boat,
      And live upon the sea;
    So merrily I’d float,
      With naught to trouble me--
                      Trouble me.

    But should a storm come near,
      And fill me with alarms,
    I would row to mother dear--
      My boat should be her arms,
                  Mother’s arms.

         [Illustration]




         A LITTLE STORY.


    I will write a little story,
      About a little boy;
    He is his father’s comfort,
      He is his mother’s joy.

    When we give a little errand,
      He thinks of what is said,
    Pulls down his little waistcoat,
      And holds up his little head.

    He holds his little fork
      By the handle as he should,
    And never spills his coffee,
      Nor drops about his food.

    His face is very pleasant,
      What he says is always true,
    Now tell me, _youngest reader_
      If this little boy is _you_.




       MY LITTLE DOLL ROSE.


    I have a little doll,
      I take care of her clothes;
    She has soft flaxen hair,
      And her name is Rose.

    She has pretty blue eyes,
      And a very small nose,
    And a cunning little mouth;
      And her name is Rose.

    I have a little sofa
      Where my doll may repose,
    Or sit up like a lady;
      And her name is Rose.

    My doll can move her arms,
      And stand upon her toes,
    She can make a pretty courtesy,
      My dear little Rose.




         [Illustration]




      MY BIRD IS GONE.


    “My bird is gone,”
      Said Fanny Ray;
    “My bird has flown,
      I can not play.

    “He sung so sweetly,
      Every day;
    He sings no more,
      I can not play.

    “Go, put his cage
      Far, far away,
    I do not love,
      His cage to-day.”

    She wiped her eyes,
      Poor Fanny Ray;
    And sat and sighed,
      But could not play.

       [Illustration]




      THE BIRD’S ANSWER.


    “I am sorry, my dear,
    But I’d rather live here;
    The skies they are fair,
    And I love the fresh air,
    The trees they are green,
    And I sit like a queen,
    On a branch as it goes,
    While the pleasant wind blows
    I have more on my table
    To eat than I’m able,
    For the very large field
    My dessert does yield;
    But come from your book,
    With a good humored look,
    When with care you have read
    And your lesson is said,
    Sit under the tree,
    With your sewing by me,
    And this afternoon,
    I will sing you a tune.”




         THE KITE.


    Oh look at my kite,
    In its airy flight,
    How pretty it flies,
    Right up to the skies,
    With its white breast stirr’d,
    Just like a bird!

      Pretty kite, pretty kite,
    In your airy flight
    What do you spy,
    In the bright blue sky?

      I wish I was you,
    To be there too,
    Oh, then, how soon
    I would peep at the moon,
    And see the man there,
    Who gives me a stare,
    When I look up at night,
    At his beautiful light!




      OH! LOOK AT THE MOON.


    Oh, look at the moon!
      She is shining up there,
    Oh, mother, she looks
      Like a lamp in the air.

    Last week she was smaller,
      And shaped like a bow,
    But now she’s grown bigger,
      And round as an O.

    Pretty moon, pretty moon,
      How you shine on the door,
    And make it all bright
      On my nursery floor.

    You shine on my playthings,
      And show me their place,
    And I love to look up
      At your pretty bright face

    And there is a star
      Close by you, and may be
    That small twinkling star
      Is your little baby.




       THE SLEEPING BABY.


    Hush, hush, with your noise,
      What a talking you keep,
    You rude little boys,
      Now the baby’s asleep!
                Hushaby, baby.

    Mamma has just told me
      To stay quite here,
    And, oh, she will scold me,
      If wakes, baby dear.
                Hushaby, baby.

    How soft its white arm,
      As it lies on its breast,
    Little baby no harm
      Shall come while you rest,
                Hushaby, hush.

    My task has been given,
      And I will be true,
    And sister and Heaven
      Will watch over you.
                Hushaby, baby.




     SCHOOL IS OUT.


    School is out,
    But do not shout;
    School is done,
    But do not run.

    Put up your slate,
    Neat and straight;
    Make your bow,
    If you know how.

    Take your “_spelling_,”
    To your dwelling,
    Your “_reading_” too,
    Keep clean and new.

    Then go home,
    And do not roam;
    Your parents kiss,
    In quietness.

    Now run and play;
    And so, “good day.”




         TO AN ANT.


    Run here, little ant,
    For the pretty bird can’t.
    I want you to come,
    And live at my home;
    I know you will stay,
    And help me to play.
    Stop making that hill,
    Little ant, and be still;
    Come creep to my feet,
    Here is sugar to eat.
    Say are you not weary,
    My poor little deary,
    With bearing that load,
    Across the wide road?
    Leave your hill now, to me,
    And then you shall see,
    That by filling my hand,
    I can pile up the sand,
    And save you the pains,
    Of bringing these grains.




       THE ANT’S ANSWER.


    Stop, stop, little miss,
    No such building as this,
    Will answer for me,
    As you plainly can see.
    I take very great pains,
    And place all the grains
    As if with a tool,
    By a carpenter’s rule.
    You have thrown the sand
    All out of your hand,
    And so filled up my door,
    That I can’t find it more.
    My king and my queen
    Are choked up within;
    My little ones too,
    Oh what shall I do?
    You have smothered them all
    With the sand you let fall;
    I must borrow, or beg,
    Or look for an egg,
    To keep under my eye,
    For help by-and-by.
    A new house I must raise,
    In a very few days,
    Nor stand here and pine,
    Because you’ve spoilt mine.
    For when winter days come,
    I shall mourn for my home;
    So stand out of my way,
    I have no time to play.

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all

        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
