The little Poem now presented to the Public, was intended for publication
immediately after the appearance of the "Peacock at Home," but from various
causes, was laid aside till now. In the opinion of the Publisher, however,
it is so nearly allied in point of merit to that celebrated Trifle, that he
is induced, although at this late period, to print it with a few
appropriate embellishments.




                              THE                                     [p 5]
                          PEACOCK, &c.




  Ye votaries of Fashion, who have it to boast,
  That your names to posterity will not be lost;
  That the last _Morning Chronicle_ due honor paid
  To the still-blooming Dowager's gay Masquerade;
  That the Minister's Dinner has blaz'd in _the Times_,
  That the Countess's Gala has jingled in rhymes;
  Oh! tell me, who would not endeavour to please,
  And exert ev'ry nerve, for rewards such as these?

  It was early in Spring--but no matter what year,                    [p 6]
  That the PEACOCK, delighting in noise, and good cheer,
  Determin'd, for dear notoriety's sake,
  A dash in the whirlpool of Fashion to make.
  A Concert and Ball, their attractions united,
  To which the _Beau-Monde_ were politely invited.
  Away they all flew, it was heavenly weather,
  And soon at the PEACOCK'S arriv'd, in full feather.
  The scene was enchanting! for taste so refin'd
  Had never appear'd with such splendor combin'd.
  The Dance was all gaiety, frolic, and glee;
  The Music transporting! the Supper _exquis_!
  The Beaux were all _prime_, and the flow'r of the nation,
  The Belles were all style, beauty, grace, fascination:
  Good humour presided, where pleasure was law,
  And the guests, more or less, all came off with _eclat_.

  But, alas! Time has wings; and tho' still vastly clever,
  We cannot make Balls last for ever and ever,
  When day was seen breaking, the company parted;                     [p 7]
  And none, I am told, ever went lighter hearted.

  "I knew," cried SIR ARGUS, "_my_ Gala would shine:
  Oh! charming distinction, Oh! pleasure divine.
  Yes! _I_ too shall see myself figure away
  In the records of fashion, the buz of the day;
  And the world shall admire, in ages to come,
  The brilliant display of the PEACOCK at Home."

  Two months had now pass'd, and SIR ARGUS, one morning,
  Was ruffling his plumes, and his person adorning,
  When lo! from the regions of air, quick descending,
  A PIGEON appear'd, and his neck gently bending,
  Presented a Billet; then silently bow'd,
  And, spreading his wings, was soon lost in a cloud.

  SIR ARGUS, astonish'd, in haste now uncloses
  The paper, perfum'd with fresh Otto of Roses.
  "In fortune's dear name," he exclaims, "what is this                [p 8]
  '_The Peacock at Home!_' Oh! superlative bliss!
  My feelings, prophetic, the honor foretold;
  Yes! _The Peacock at Home_ shall be printed in gold:
  How just the description! what grace, and what spirit!
  Aye--this is indeed a production of merit."

  Be it known, that the great _Biped Lords of Creation_,
  Of _every_ class, and in _every_ station,
  All secretly cherish, what all yet disclaim,
  _That_ feeling, which we _curiosity_ name.
  Now our PEACOCK imperial, tho' too proud to own,
  That the fav'rite of Juno had ever been prone
  To a weakness, he always had _wish'd_ to believe
  Was exclusively felt by the _Daughters of Eve_,
  Yet died with impatience to know who had written
  The elegant verses, with which he was smitten.
  His thoughts were all now on discovery bent,
  And, in haste, for the PARROT he instantly sent:
  Who shortly arriv'd, overjoy'd beyond measure,                      [p 9]
  And, strutting, demanded SIR ARGUS'S pleasure?

[Illustration: _"The Peacock with vanity fully inflated." p. 9._]

  The PEACOCK, with vanity fully inflated,
  Erected his plumes, and the triumph related;
  Then quiv'ring his wings, and expanding his breast,
  The listening PARROT in these words address'd:--
  "My friend, I acknowledge the Poem divine,
  And that genius and wit breathe thro' every line;
  But it is not enough that to Fame we devote it,
  You, the Herald of Ton, must inform me who _wrote_ it."

  The PARROT, who now was expiring to speak,
  Twirl'd his ebony tongue, and then op'ning his beak,
  In a tone of importance, without hesitation,
  Directly began a high-sounding oration.
  "SIR ARGUS, no mortal could e'er have desir'd,
  More exquisite verses than those you've inspir'd.
  The Muse has for _you_, indeed, tried all her art,                 [p 10]
  And with envy, no doubt, has fill'd many a heart:
  I wonder not, then, you are anxious to know
  From _whose_ pen these strains of sweet harmony flow.
  'Tis true, I have chanc'd in my wanderings to meet
  With _some_ secrets; and _such_ anecdotes _cou'd_ repeat!
  However, no matter; I give you my word,
  That who wrote this fine Poem, I never yet heard;
  But it much wou'd delight me the truth to discover,
  Altho' I shou'd fly for it all the world over:
  What say you, SIR ARGUS, the fact to insure,
  Suppose we were both to set out on a tour?"

  "Agreed! my good Sir; far as England extends,
  Then together we'll travel, and visit our friends:
  Endeavour to find out the name of our Poet,
  And e'er we return, ten to one but we know it."
  A tempting repast they now hastily shar'd,                         [p 11]
  Of grain and dried cherries, already prepar'd:
  Then sipping some drops from a neighbouring spring,
  Made no further delay, but directly took wing.

  Awhile they fled on, over meadow, thro' grove,
  Delighted, for novelty's sake, thus to rove:
  Yet sometimes alighted, preferring a walk,
  The PEACOCK for ease, and the PARROT for talk;
  Till, at last, poor SIR ARGUS began to complain,
  Of the sad inconvenience he felt from his train,
  And propos'd, as the sky seem'd to threaten a shower,
  To rest till the morning, at Nightingale Bower;
  The obsequious PARROT replied by a bow,
  And they went on as fast as their strength would allow.

  PHILOMELA, to whom her retirement was dear,
  Felt vex'd at beholding the flutterers near;
  For living in harmony, softness, and quiet,                        [p 12]
  She hated all bustle, intrusion, and riot;
  And tho' a _few_ trips to the gay world she made,
  Her heart, still unalter'd, remain'd in the shade.
  However, our fair pensive warbler well knew,
  Some sacrifice still to politeness was due;
  She, therefore, soon hasten'd the coxcombs to meet;
  And welcom'd them both to her rural retreat.
  A delicate supper before them was plac'd,
  Not with splendor, indeed, but simplicity grac'd;
  At which she presided with elegant ease,
  And that native good breeding, that always must please.
  SIR ARGUS seem'd charm'd, and shew'd great condescension,
  Was all affability, grace, and attention:
  Till growing impatient, without much preamble,
  He eagerly mention'd the cause of his ramble.
  But no information, alas! he receiv'd,
  At which he was hurt, and the NIGHTINGALE griev'd;
  But hop'd he wou'd be more successful ere long,                    [p 13]
  And propos'd, _en attendant_, to give him a song.
  Delighted, he begg'd PHILOMEL would proceed;
  She complied; and 'twas something _like_ singing, indeed.
  No cadence was ever perform'd with such neatness:
  Grassini herself never sang with such sweetness.
  The favor was next of the PARROT requested,
  Who, clearing his throat, was quite hoarse, he protested:
  Yet gave "Pretty Poll,"[1] with such fine intonation,
  SIR ARGUS cried "Bravo!" and scream'd approbation.

  The Travellers now with fatigue were opprest,
  So they both bade adieu, and retired to rest:
  A sun-shiny morn to their slumbers succeeded,
  When, wak'd to new life, on their way they proceeded.

  A poor captive STARLING, who liv'd near the road,                  [p 14]
  They soon spied, and enquir'd for the Poet's abode:
  But 'twas useless, indeed! tho' they made a great rout,
  For he only kept crying, "I cannot get out!"
  This want of attention the PEACOCK enrag'd,
  And he fiercely exclaim'd, "Ha! 'tis well thou art cag'd!
  But, dear Mr. PARROT, methought that I saw
  The gilt Ball on the Dome of the LADY MACAW:
  With _her_ we will breakfast at Aviary Hall,
  And who knows what success may our visit befal."
  Now it luckily happened on this very day,
  That the COUNTESS was giving a grand _Dejeuné_;
  And she actually started--so great her delight,
  When the elegant Visitor came within sight.
  _He_, of course, was receiv'd with respect most profound;
  And her Ladyship curtsied quite down to the ground.
  The PARROT was likewise made welcome, _surtout_,
  By that pink of all fashion, _La belle_ COCKATOO;
  While his little smart Cousin, the gay PEROQUET,                   [p 15]
  Declar'd that the party was now quite complete.

[Illustration: _"A poor captive Starling who liv'd near the road." p. 14._]

  The most exquisite dainties the Spring wou'd afford,
  Arrang'd with much taste, soon appear'd on the board;
  And when breakfast was over, the PEACOCK arose,
  His plans and his triumph at once to disclose.
  His magnificent train he now rais'd from the ground,
  Spread its glories to view; and then flourishing round,
  Deliver'd the Poem, with great exultation,
  And caus'd in the circle no small agitation.
  Baron STORK[2] and the fair DEMOISELLE were delighted;
  While some, less distinguish'd, conceiv'd themselves slighted:
  The SPARROW was most opportunely engag'd,
  Or _he_ wou'd have been beyond all bounds enrag'd.

  However, the Author not one could divine,                          [p 16]
  Tho' they ponder'd, and ponder'd, at every line:
  And all only serving to puzzle them more,
  SIR ARGUS continued as wise as before.
  Distracted, he knew not well whither to go,
  This last disappointment afflicted him so;
  But at length, on reflection, thought only one fowl
  Cou'd have sense to inform him, and that was the OWL.
  To _her_ he resolv'd, then, a visit to make,
  And her Supper, the following night, to partake.

  In the meanwhile, the PARROT with quickness rehearses,
  Again, and again, the most charming of verses.
  Smart things fly about; Repartees, and Bon-Mots,
  With too many _secrets_ that _all the world knows_:
  Old Anecdotes came on the _tapis_, new drest,
  And season'd with Satire, to give them a zest.
  But the COUNTESS was shock'd! and declar'd with much feeling,      [p 17]
  "_She_ hated the faults of her neighbour revealing.
  Detraction, of late, had been full of employment,
  And truly, _some_ folks knew no other enjoyment.
  'Twas said, tho' for _her_ part, she thought it quite cruel,
  That Monsieur LE COQ had been kill'd in a _duel_.
  The _Hedge_-SPARROW publicly swore all was true,
  That so long had been told of the Tyrant CUCKOO;
  And the BULLFINCH _did_ whistle indeed to some tune,
  When he said a _great Pleader_ had stolen a spoon!"

  "It is false!" cried a little bird, known as a _wag_;
  "And _I_ would indite him, at once, for _Scan. Mag._"
  All the Company now rais'd their pinions and eyes,
  And protested their plumes stood on end with surprise!
  While young Mrs. PEE-WIT, dear sweet gentle creature!
  Evinc'd _her_ abhorrence in every feature:
  Her soft bosom swell'd, and she thought it was grievous,           [p 18]
  That malice should lead the world thus to deceive us:
  For _she_ too had heard a long, odious relation
  Of cruel oppression, and vile peculation;
  And own'd, (tho' it _might_ be as false as the rest,)
  It was whisper'd, the Goldfinch had feather'd _her_ nest.

  How ev'ry one star'd! "what detestable stories!"
  The PARROT aloud cried, "O! tempora, O! mores!"
  But Phoebus advancing, now brought on the day,
  And the PEACOCK declar'd he must hasten away.
  His Companion directly Sir Argus obey'd,
  And both to the Countess some compliments paid;
  Then bow'd a farewell, spread their light wings again,
  And found themselves, shortly, once more, _en chemin_.

[Illustration: _"They reach'd the Owl's residence, Ivy clad Tower."
p. 19._]

  They walk'd, and they flutter'd, they hopp'd, and they flew,
  And weary enough ere the evening grew:
  But a pure chrystal stream _some_ refreshment afforded,            [p 19]
  And each, in his crop, certain treasures had hoarded.
  Exerting their energies, both then proceeded,
  Tho' many disasters their progress impeded:
  His train now again poor Sir Argus tormented,
  And the loss of _some_ feathers cou'd not be prevented:
  The PARROT was ruffled, and torn, and distrest,
  But still, _curiosity_ reign'd in his breast:
  This, _this_ was the spur that our Travellers sped,
  And urg'd them both onward, tho' almost half dead.

  At length, to their joy, at no very late hour,
  They reach'd the Owl's residence, Ivy-clad-Tower.
  But what were their feelings, when after such rambling,
  They still must encounter fresh clawing and scrambling?
  The sage Bird of Night had long chosen her station
  Aloft, where she sat in profound meditation:
  The clustering Ivy her lone dwelling shaded,                       [p 20]
  Which no glaring Sun-beam had ever pervaded;
  Within it, the Stranger had never intruded,
  And there she had liv'd, from all Idlers secluded.
  How great, then, were now her dismay and surprise;
  Thrice she call'd on Minerva, and thrice rubb'd her eyes;
  But doubted not long; for the Visitors now
  Came full in her presence, and made a low bow.
  The Dame, tho' annoy'd, did not wish to be rude,
  So she wisely receiv'd them as well as she could.
  A frugal repast was prepar'd very soon,
  Which together they shar'd, by the light of the Moon.
  Some berries and seeds, the OWL thought would suffice,
  In addition to _her_ stew of Small-birds and Mice;
  And if no costly Viands awaited them here,
  Keen hunger made up for the want of good cheer.

  The supper dispatch'd, our illustrious Guest,
  Till his Story was told, not a moment cou'd rest;
  While the OWL her brain rummag'd, (now quite on th' alert,)        [p 21]
  For a few scraps of learning, by way of dessert:
  But the PEACOCK had no inclination to wait,
  And the PARROT was still more impatient to prate:
  So the Poem was read, and the OWL vow'd she never
  Had heard any Verses she thought half so clever.

  But, "_who is the Author?_" this still was the theme
  Of Sir Argus's Song, and his night and day dream.
  "Oh! let me," he cries, "of your kindness implore,
  Dear, sweet Mrs. OWLET, yet one favor more!
  Acquaint us, I pray, with the name of our Poet;
  Its worth will be doubled, to _you_ when we owe it."

  "Dear Sir," said the Dame, who lov'd flatt'ry as well,
  As if folly had made her a mere modern Belle,
  "Much joy would it give me to grant your request,
  But, in truth, I am not of this secret possest.
  I have thought a good deal, and feel really vex'd;                 [p 22]
  For the more I consider, the more I'm perplex'd:
  However, _thus_ much I will venture to tell;
  A _female_ alone could have written so well."
  Sir Argus believ'd the Dame _might_ have guess'd right;
  Yet, _entre-nous_, thought her not very polite:
  But that was a trifle; he now had a clew
  To assist his research; and more satisfied grew:
  Since the OWL'S well-known wisdom, and vast penetration,
  From time immemorial had claim'd admiration.

  But ev'ning clos'd in, and we well may suppose,
  That our Travellers long'd for a little repose:
  While the Moon-loving Dame, who had no wish to sleep,
  Meant in pensive delight, her lone vigil to keep:
  So her Guests took their leave, with a friendly adieu,
  And, forthwith, to a neighbouring Lime Tree withdrew.
  Their eyes now soon close, the night passes away,                  [p 23]
  And the LARK calls them up, at the first peep of day:
  When, quickly descending, each shakes his bright plumes,
  And with fresh expectation his journey resumes.

  The PEACOCK is now more accustom'd to travel;
  And less inclin'd, therefore, at trifles to cavil:
  So, cheerfully lends his smooth wings to the breeze,
  And with rapture extols ev'ry prospect he sees.
  O'er many a bank, with sweet violets spread,
  Green field, blooming garden, and hyacinth-bed;
  Thro' daisy-deck'd vallies, o'er soft swelling hills,
  Across velvet-clad lawns, and beside limpid rills,
  Our Travellers roam'd; till they found a young TURTLE,
  Who liv'd with her Mate, in an arbour of Myrtle:
  But what cou'd be learnt from two countrified DOVES,
  Who were thinking, from morning to night, of their loves?
  No! they begg'd to observe nothing _rude_ was intended,            [p 24]
  But Concerts and Balls, DOVES had _never_ attended:
  In rural enjoyments _they_ pass'd time away,
  And car'd for no Poems, nor Poets--not they!
  Our Birds of _haut-ton_ set them down for a pair
  Of the silliest creatures that flutter'd in air!
  But breakfast appearing, a kind invitation
  To share it, still met with their full approbation;
  So both ate as much as they knew how to carry,
  And vow'd they no longer a moment cou'd tarry:
  Then hurrying off, without further ado,
  Said, "good morning, my friends," and the TURTLES cried, "Coo!"

[Illustration: _"To the banks of a lake, where resided the Swan." p. 25._]

  Our Travellers now again anxiously thought
  Of the elegant Authoress, eagerly sought;
  And still of each female they met, as they flew,
  Impatiently ask'd, "is it you ma'am? or _you_?"
  But vain was the question; so both hasten'd on,                    [p 25]
  To the banks of a lake, where resided the SWAN;
  But _she_ was in majesty sailing away
  On her silver domain, and gone out for the day.
  They, therefore, proceeded to Turkey-Cock Farm,
  And caus'd in the family there, some alarm:
  But the PEACOCK his _Cousin_ most kindly embrac'd,
  And the fright of the Youngsters was shortly effac'd:
  So the PARROT, with spirit, the Poem recited,
  And all were, or seem'd to be, highly delighted.
  But as for the _Writer_--alas! they as soon
  Cou'd have told them the name of the Man in the Moon:
  And the TURKEY-COCK'S SPOUSE her Guests calmly entreated,
  To quit the pursuit, and be quietly seated.

  But all wou'd not do; so, by way of excuse,
  They pleaded a visit to good MOTHER GOOSE;
  Who near, on a common, _en passant_, they saw,                     [p 26]
  And had heard she had lately come out of the straw.
  But the GOOSE of their tale not a word understood,
  And still cackled away to her terrified brood;
  While immers'd in a pond, to complete their ill luck,
  Topsy-turvy appear'd, at a distance, the DUCK!

  What _now_ cou'd they do? why, they both persever'd,
  While the hope of succeeding their bosoms still cheer'd.
  On the WOODCOCK they call'd; on the PARTRIDGE and PHEASANT;
  And, killing time thus, thought exceedingly pleasant:
  Till grown somewhat weary, in order to rest,
  A sandwich they took at the GUINEA-FOWL'S nest.
  But how shall we count all the visits they pay,
  To the RAVEN, the MAGPIE, the ROOK, and the JAY?
  To the FINCHES of fashion, the GOLD and the GREEN,
  To the BLACKBIRD, the THRUSH, and the ABERDAVINE?
  With a great many more, who were now all so busy,                  [p 27]
  To fix their attention, was not very easy.
  The WREN was employ'd in constructing a nest;
  And the LINNET had join'd in a song, the REDBREAST:
  The BITTERN was gone to the river, to fish,
  And procure, before dinner, his favorite dish:
  The SWALLOW was building; the HARRIER[3] hunting,
  The BANTAM was sitting, and so was the BUNTING.
  In vain, then, our Travellers hop'd to obtain
  But a word, or a hint, that might soften their pain.
  From county to county they thus made their way,
  And submitted to all things, except to delay.
  From Norfolk they came up to town in a hurry,
  And found themselves soon on the borders of Surry.
  From thence off to Lincoln, and Heaven knows where,                [p 28]
  Till they got into Yorkshire, almost in despair:
  And well might they feel nearly hopeless, indeed,
  When their rambling at last brought them down to the Tweed!

  They look'd at each other, in silent dismay,
  And the PARROT for once, cou'd not tell what to say!
  But, at length, recollecting, they turn'd short about,
  Not a single jot wiser, than when they sat out.
  Yet their warm bosoms still for the dear secret panted,
  And this friend, and that, supplied all else they wanted.
  So, drooping and sorrowful, harrass'd and sore,
  They skimm'd the blue mountain, and cross'd the black moor,
  And the PARROT, by this time quite clamorous grown,
  Declar'd _he_ should die of impatience alone.

  However, consulting, they thought it was best
  Now to steer a _new_ course; so went down to the West.
  On a high Cliff, in Cornwall, they found out the CHOUGH;           [p 29]
  But how shou'd _he_ learn what was passing below?
  Thro' Devon, so fam'd for its picturesque views,
  They pass'd with a haste one can scarcely excuse;
  From thence got to Somerset, almost benighted,
  And soon on the summit of Mendip alighted.
  There, most _à propos_, they immediately found
  A Moss-cover'd Root-house,[4] with evergreens bound;
  Beneath whose kind shelter, fatigu'd and opprest,
  They gladly agreed till the morning to rest.
  SIR ARGUS now cried, with a sigh and a tear,
  "I wish that our travels, my friend, could end _here_:
  Yet dread lest we many miles further should go,
  And never, at last, our sweet Poetess know!"

  But Fortune, capricious, who sports at her leisure,                [p 30]
  With birds, as with men, when it suits her good pleasure,
  Resolv'd, after teazing Sir Argus awhile,
  To reward, in the end, all his toils with her smile.

  Aurora with splendor unusual arose,
  When the PEACOCK and PARROT awoke from repose,
  And how were their bosoms delighted and cheer'd,
  When before them a perfect Elysium appear'd!
  Reluctant they left it, again to explore,
  Unconscious what happiness yet was in store:
  But the country they travers'd was smiling and gay,
  While the Sun, brightly shining, illumin'd their way;
  And we all know how cheerful, how sweet is the scene,
  When Nature unfolds her new livery of green.
  The Birds carol'd round them, the Butterfly play'd,
  And the soft vernal breeze kindly lent them its aid.

[Illustration: _"Till, all their cares over, in DORSET they found her."
p. 31._]

  Thus, gently reviving, Hope sooth'd them again,                    [p 31]
  And they shortly forgot both their sorrow and pain.
  A path strew'd with flowers, they gaily pursued,
  And, in fancy, their long-sought Incognita view'd;
  Till, _all their cares over_, in DORSET[5] they found her
  And, plucking a wreath of green Bay-leaves, they _crown'd_ her.

  Now, what more remains of our PEACOCK to say,
  But that, homeward, triumphant, he wing'd back his way,
  Proclaim'd his success to the whole Biped Nation,
  And proudly accepted their congratulation.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
