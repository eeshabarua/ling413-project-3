THE LION'S MASQUERADE.                                             [p 3]


  As Aurora stept forth from the gates of the East,
  With her garland of roses, and dew-spangled vest,
  A clamour unusual assaulted her ear,
  Instead of the Lark, and her friend Chanticleer,
  At least though their voices she sometimes could trace,
  They seem'd overpower'd by the whole feather'd race:
  And such was the chirping, and fluttering then,
  It rouz'd _an old Lion_ asleep in his den;
  Enrag'd at this racket so much out of season,                    [p 4]
  He, roaring, sent out to ask what was the reason,
  And the _Jackal_ soon learnt from some stragglers about,
  'Twas the company come from _Sir Argus's_ rout.
  The gay _feather'd people_ pursuing their flight,
  Were soon out of hearing, and soon out of sight.
  But the _King of the Quadrupeds_ vainly sought rest,
  For something like envy had poison'd his breast.
  What then were his feelings the following day,
  When every creature he met on his way,
  Could talk about nothing, both early and late,
  But the Peacock's most sumptuous, and elegant fête.
  His name, through the woods as he wander'd along,
  Was still made the burthen of every song.
  That the concert was exquisite, all were agreed,                 [p 5]
  And so were the ball, and the supper indeed,
  The company too of the very first rank,
  And the wit that prevail'd, and the toasts that were drank:
  He found to his infinite rage and vexation,
  'Twas the favourite subject half over the nation;
  And feeling no longer a relish to roam,
  He return'd to his Lioness, sullenly, home.
  "Fair consort of mine, 'tis our pleasure," he said,
  "To give very shortly, _a grand Masquerade_.
  Tho' the Butterfly's ball, and the Grasshopper's feasts,
  Were too mean for my notice, as King of the beasts;
  Now the Peacock has chosen to give a fine rout,
  Which is heard of so much, is so blazon'd about,
  Has excited such rapture, and warm approbation,                  [p 6]
  As threatens the rank which we hold in creation.
  Then with diligence, love, for my banquet prepare,
  And mind all the beasts of the forest are there."
  'Twas the task of the _Jackal_ the tickets to pen,
  "_The Lion sees masks, on the twentieth, at ten_."
  It would take a whole volume distinctly to name,
  The answer on answer that following came.
  There were some that were sick from the changeable weather,
  And some long engag'd in snug parties together.
  But few, very few would refuse such a thing,
  As a grand entertainment announc'd by their King.
  All devoted the time now to due preparation,
  To decide on their character, dress, decoration.

[Illustration: _"The Lioness, willing to sanction the rest." p. 7._]

  At length Phoebus dawn'd on the long wish'd-for day              [p 7]
  Which their beauty, their talents, and wit should display.
  What licking, and cleaning, what endless adorning,
  Not a creature stirr'd out the whole course of the morning;
  And some of their dresses were barely complete,
  At the time they were punctually order'd to meet,
  The _Lioness_, willing to sanction the rest,
  With a helmet, and spear, as Britannia was drest;
  But the Lion, as lord of the banquet, remain'd
  In the same noble figure that Nature ordain'd;
  And crouching beside her, with dignified mien,
  Contributed much to the state of his Queen.
  The _Jackal Lord Chamberlain_ waited upon her,
  And two _little Lap-dogs_ as _Pages of Honour:_
  While twelve _Orang-Outangs_ were station'd without,             [p 8]
  To usher the company in, and about.
  At the hour which his King had thought proper to name,
  The _Horse_, as the _Hounyhm_ of Gulliver came;
  Unaccustomed to "utter the thing that is not,"[*]
  He reach'd, at the moment he promis'd, the spot.
  The _Fox_ then appear'd on a different scent,
  On foul depredation, and villainy bent;
  And the dress of a _country attorney_ he chose,
  To his purpose best suited, as all the world knows!
  With looks as impatient, and teeming with sin,
  The _Wolf in Sheep's-clothing_ was next usher'd in.


    * Vide Gulliver's Travels.

[Illustration: _"A Lamb Miss in her teens, with her Aunt, an old Mutton."
                                                                   p. 9._]

  The guests now came thronging in numbers untold,                 [p 9]
  The furious, the gentle, the young and the old.
  In dominos some, but in characters most,
  And now a brave warrior, and then a fair toast.
  The _Baboon_, as a _Counsellor_; _Alderman_, _Glutton_;
  A _Lamb_, Miss _in her teens_, with her _aunt_, an _old mutton_.
  It was easy to see, as this couple past by,
  The _Wolf_, very knowingly, cast a _Sheep's eye_.
  And now at the door was a terrible clatter,
  The beasts all about wonder'd what was the matter.
  A poor _Cat in pattens_ came running so fast,
  Her ticket was almost forgot as the past;
  But there was, it appear'd, quite enough to alarm her,          [p 10]
  For close at her heels came a _great Hog in armour_.
  Then follow'd his friend in a very large wig
  As a _deep read professor_--the _fam'd learned Pig_--
  A _Bear_ came as _Caliban_, loaded with wood,
  His bones full of _aches_ from Prospero's rod.
  The _Greyhound_ as _Vanity_ holding a glass,
  The _Stag_, as _Actæon_; King _Midas_, the _Ass_.
  And next them a sullen, and obstinate _Mule_,
  As a _Dunce_, who had just been expell'd from his school.
  The _Mastiff_ a brave _English sailor_ appear'd,
  No friend he betray'd, and no enemy fear'd:

[Illustration: _But there was it appear'd, quite enough to alarm her.
                                                              p. 10._]

  _Britannia_ receiv'd him with mark'd condescension,             [p 11]
  And paid him all night, most distinguished attention.
  Now skipping along on the tip of his toe,
  Came a _chattering Monkey_, a Frenchifi'd beau:
  And reeling behind, in an _officer's dress_,
  Was his pert younger brother, just come from the mess;
  With manners as forward, and strut as complete,
  As other _young Ensigns_ you see in the street.
  The _Bull_ came as _Taurus_, all studded with stars;
  _Capricornus_, the _Goat_; a _Bull-dog_, as Mars.
  Now refreshments by order were handed about,
  And the dancing commenc'd with a terrible rout;
  When suddenly silence pervaded the throng,                      [p 12]
  Some Eastern grandees were conducted along.
  Attendants preceded with all due decorum,
  And _Spaniels_, as _courtiers_, came fawning before 'em.
  No longer in servitude bending the knee,
  And destin'd, the first of his kind, to be free,
  The _Camel_ approach'd, with magnificence drest
  As a _Nabob_, who lately arriv'd from the East.
  From the Island of _Ceylon_ an _Elephant_ came,
  In costume complete, as the _King of Siam_:
  Thence follow'd a _Native_ of snowy white race,
  Respect and affection, were mark'd in his face,

[Illustration: _"Thence follow'd a Native of snowy white race." p. 12_]

  An appendage of grandeur, with chowries hung round,             [p 13]
  And tissu'd embroidery that trail'd on the ground;
  Round his tusks precious stones, gold, and diamonds were set,
  He was one splendid mass from his head to his feet.
  The _Tiger_, a _fierce Indian Chief_, in the rear,
  Many foreigners too of distinction were there.
  This magnificent group so astonish'd the crowd,
  That some, in their rapture, applauded aloud.
  Supper now was announc'd; with a terrible crush,
  To the door did the ravenous visitants rush:
  For some time none could pass, but the first that were able,
  Found, _Glutton_ the _Alderman_, seated at table.
  At the banquet the guests in amazement were lost,               [p 14]
  And the _King of Siam_ took the right of his host.
  Beside him, a vase fill'd with water was plac'd,
  Of chrystal, and gold, very skilfully chac'd:
  With flow'rs of the orange the handles were bound,
  And Otto of Roses was sprinkled around--
  Before him were cocoa nuts, figs, wheat, and rice,
  The wood of acacia, banana, and spice:
  With arrack, and every delicate wine,
  That each nation can press from the clustering vine.
  To proceed were but tedious; for every _beast_,
  As well as the _Elephant_, found a rich feast.

[Illustration: _"At the Banquet the guests in amazement were lost."
                                                             p. 14_]

  And now their _great Monarch_, who quitted his seat,            [p 15]
  With an air of true majesty said, "I entreat,
  As he fears my displeasure, that every _creature_,
  Will to-night lay aside all that's bad in his nature.
  You have heard with what harmony _Birds_ can retire,
  And their conduct in this respect all must admire.
  In the _feather'd race_ here an example we find,
  Far better than that which is set by _Mankind_.
  How oft have their galas a tragical end,
  One loses a mistress, another a friend--
  The wife of a third has elop'd from a ball,
  A fourth the next day in a duel must fall.
  Yes! such are the fatal effects of excess,                      [p 16]
  Which _reason_ was given to _man_ to repress.
  But now let us tell them, with pride, in their _feasts_,
  To copy the _Insects_, the _Birds_, and the _Beasts_."
  The effect of his speech was immediately seen,
  They all roar'd _"Rule Britannia"_ in praise of his Queen.
  And as soon as their _Monarch_ had quitted the room,
  Without growl, grunt, or grumble, they all scrambled home.

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
