    Here’s Emily, saying good night,
      O what a sweet little Miss!
    She’s not sleepy but dolly is quite,
      Come dear and give me a kiss.

    She’s been running about all the day,
      She’s had tea with some jam on her bread,
    There’s a time both for tea and for play,
      And now it is time for her bed.

    My little baby
      Is so very small
    That she can scarcely toddle,
      And can’t speak at all.

    But she can stand a-tip-toe,
      If she can’t walk,
    And she can look at pictures,
      Though she can’t talk.

    Come little baby,
      Sit on mother’s knee,
    She shall look at a pretty book,
      And then have tea.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


      Din, din, din,
      We’re ready to begin.
    We’re so hungry that we can’t wait.

      O what a clatter
      Of spoon and platter!
    What’s Mary doing that she’s so late?

      Drum, drum, drum,
      Now she’s come.
    Look at naughty Ned with his plate upon his head!

      Din, din, din,
      Now we’ll begin.
    Mary brings the soup and father cuts the bread.

    I am his mother,
    And he is your brother,
    There’s ne’er such another
      In all the world round.

    His smile is the queerest,
    His eyes are the clearest,
    His face is the dearest,
      That ever were found.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]


    This is my birthday,
    O what a mirth-day!
        And O how lucky I am!
    I have dollies and carts,
    I have eaten three tarts,
        And now here’s a big pot of jam.

        Emma! just look,
        What a wonderful cook!
        Currant and raisin
        She puts in the basin,
    Only see how her hand throws in the flour.

        Sugar and suet,
        She knows how to do it.
        Now then crumbs,
        Now more plums,
    She puts everything good into our Christmas pudding.

        Eggs half a score,
        And many things more,
        Lemon-peel candied,
    And everything brandied,
        O what a treat it will be when completed.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    O Fanny, dear Fanny,
      Make haste with the bed,
    My doll is so tired
      That she can’t raise her head.

    Your doll is so old,
      She can sit up till eight,
    But mine is quite ill
      If she stays up so late.

    We’ve set out the tea things,
      We’ve coffee and tea,
    There is no one to drink them
      But dolly and we.

    We’ve muffins and crumpets,
      We’ve biscuit and cake,
    If no one will eat them,
      Our hearts they will break.

    So I’ll go out this way,
      And you go out that,
    We will ask all our neighbours
      To come in and chat.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    I have an apple,
      Which hand has got it?
    Left hand or right hand?
      No, Sir, that’s not it.

    Now then, try again,
      Don’t look so grave,
    This or that, Sir,
      Which will you have?

    Left or right, now, tell me quick?
    There’s either an apple or nothing for Dick.

    Here’s master Jack,
    With his bag at his back,
      What do you think he is at?
    Two gay butterflies,
    With their wings full of eyes,
      He’s trying to catch in his hat.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The chaise is at the door my dear,
      Are you quite ready?
    How restive these new horses are!
      Now then--steady.
        Gee wo, gee wo.

    Take care how you get in my dear,
      And mind our lovely child,
    It would only take a little thing
      To make these horses wild.
        Ge wo, gee wo.

    Here’s little Freddy,
      He sits in his tub,
    He is quite ready
      To have a good rub.
    He is the little man for me
    Waiting there so patiently.

    While master Harry
      Does nothing but squall,
    And says when he’s older
      He won’t wash at all.
    What a naughty little man
    Who will be dirty if he can.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Fast asleep lies little May
      With dolly on her breast,
    Tread gently as you come away,
      And don’t disturb her rest.

    Her little soul it knows no fear,
      No thought of sin or sorrow,
    And God will take good care of her
      Until she wakes to-morrow.

        Fanny loves,
        Her pretty doves,
      Fan, and Puff, and Plum,
        Cream and Brown,
        They flutter down,
      And all around her come.
          Coo, coo,
          How d’ye do?
    Quite well, thank you, how are you?

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Those rude little boys,
      They do nothing but stare,
    As I ride through the snow
      In my pretty sledge chair.

    My muff and my bonnet,
      They eye them all o’er,
    As though they had not seen
      A lady before.

    Jack has pulled a tooth out,
      What a clever boy!
    He shall have a sixpence,
      Or a nice new toy.

    Without doctor helping
      He loosened it so well,
    When he gave a great tug,
      On the ground it fell.

    Maggie put it in the drawer,
      And when papa comes back,
    We’ll show it him, and he will say,
      “What a brave boy is Jack!”

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The queen of the summer,
      She sits on her throne,
    And every new comer
      Her beauty must own.

    Dick waits upon her,
      A minister sage,
    I’m maid of honour,
      And pussy’s her page.

    Let’s have a game of play,
      But Jane sha’n’t come,
    She told of Walter
      Because he picked a plum.

    “O I’m very sorry,
      I won’t do it again,”
    “We can’t trust you,
      Tell-tale Jane.”

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Underneath the soft green grass
      Little birdie lies,
    Who used to sing so merrily
      Above in summer skies.

    Sadly we have made his grave
      Where the roses blow,
    Never more he’ll sing to us
      As to school we go.

    Press the sod so firmly down,
      And smooth it o’er with care,
    Then we’ll water it again,
      And leave poor birdie there.

    My dear little Lizzie,
      Pray mind you don’t fall,
    You’re too weak to climb up
      That tub by the wall.

    For you may turn dizzy,
      And go in like a fly,
    And brother and sister,
      Will sit down and cry.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Two boys beyond the mill,
      Their kites are flying,
    Two more who climb the hill
      Will soon be trying.

    Which of them will higher fly,
    Tom’s blue tail or Bob’s red eye?

    Left--right--stand at ease.
      Hands out of pocket, Sir!
    Such lazy habits ill become
      A British Volunteer.

    Right about face! now, left wheel! halt!
      Mary does it best.
    If you are so tired, you lazy boy,
      You had better fall out and rest.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    In the early morning,
      When the air is cool,
    Look at little Emily,
      Going off to school.

    Flowers for the mistress,
      And books in a bag,
    Run away, Emily,
      And mind you don’t lag.

        A. B. C. D. E. F. G.
    Little Robin Redbreast sitting on a tree.

        H. I. J. K. L. M. N.
    He made love to little Jenny Wren.

        O. P. Q. R. S. T. U.
    Dear little Jenny I should like to marry you.

        V. & W. X. Y. Z.
    Poor little Jenny she blushed quite red.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Let’s have a slide,
    Haven’t you tried?
      You must mind if you fall.

    Now a good run,
    That’s well done,
      Plump we go into them all.

      A saucy boy,
      Had got no toy,
    And didn’t know what to do,
      So he rumpled his frock,
      And tore his sock,
    And tried to eat his shoe.

    Is not Mary clever?
      Now Mamma has taught her,
    She makes the ducks swim where she will,
      Upon a dish of water.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Father is a soldier,
      In a coat of red,
    He takes me and throws me
      Right above his head.

    Down upon the green grass,
      Up above his cap,
    Now he throws me like a ball
      Into mother’s lap.

    Do it again Papa,
      High as you can,
    I’d be a soldier
      If I were a man.

    In a summer garden
      Little son and daughter,
    Oh dear, how hot it is!
      A penny for some water.

    Mary to the pump ran,
      And tucked up her gown,
    She has pushed the handle up
      And can’t get it down.

    Jump upon the tub then,
      Pull with might and main,
    Up and down, and up and down,
      Now it comes like rain.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

      Dear me children what a rout,
      Tell me how it all fell out.

    “Please Mamma, it’s Tommy’s fault,”
      “No it isn’t, its Theresa’s.”

    “He filled the baby’s mouth with salt.”
      “She plucked the kitten with the tweezers.”

    “They won’t let me do my sum.”
      “Bob I wish you’d stop that squealing.”

    “Willie’s hit me on the thumb.”
      “Look at Charlotte, she is stealing.”

      Dear me what a horrid noise,
      Go to bed both girls and boys.

    Jenny, come again and play,
      And don’t so sulky be,
    I merely took your ball away,
      And hid it in a tree.

    Lily’s waiting at the stile,
      In her hand a basket,
    Jenny, raise your head and smile,
      Won’t you, when I ask it?

          That’s right,
            Come away,
          Sun’s bright,
            We will play
    Merrily, merrily all the day.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
