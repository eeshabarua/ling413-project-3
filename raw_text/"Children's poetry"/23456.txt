[Illustration]




Saint Nicholas.


Saint Nicholas brings presents
  For little girls and boys;
Saint Nicholas brings dozens
  Of all the nicest toys.

Hang out your biggest stocking
  Before you go to sleep;
But if you hear him coming,
  You mustn't even peep.

[Illustration: Saint Nicholas.]

[Illustration: The Sea-side Doll.]




The Sea-side Doll.


There's one doll for winter,
  When ice comes and snow;
Another for spring time,
  When primroses grow.

A dolly for dark nights,
  To take into bed;
And one for the morning,
  Till lessons are said.

But this is the dolly
  To play on the sands,
You see both a pail and
  A spade in her hands.




Ping-Pong.


Sing a song of Ping-pong,
  Fast away he ran:
"Come along," said Ping-pong,
  "Catch me if you can!"

Sing a song of Ping-pong,
  Racquet and a ball:
"Come along," said Ping-pong,
  "You can't run at all!"

[Illustration: Ping-Pong.]

[Illustration: Jujuba.]




Jujuba.


Here's Uncle Jujuba,
  Who has a sweet tooth;
He used to eat sugar-
  Cane oft in his youth,

In South Carolina,
  Where sugar-cane grows,
From which they make sugar,
  As everyone knows.




Blue-Coat.


His dressing-gown's blue, and
  His girdle is red;
He wears a black cap
  On top of his head.

He carries a candle
  To give you a light,
In case you should ever
  Get up in the night.

[Illustration: Blue-Coat.]

[Illustration: Punch.]




Punch.


There is a queer dolly named Punch,
Who has a remarkable hunch.
      The tip of his nose
      Is red as a rose,
And that's how you know Mister Punch.




The Shepherdess.


Shepherdess! Shepherdess!
  Looks to the sheep;
Shepherdess! Shepherdess!
  Watches their sleep.

Shepherdess! Shepherdess!
  When they cry "Baa,"
Shepherdess! Shepherdess!
  Knows where they are.

[Illustration: The Shepherdess.]

[Illustration: The Cowboy.]




The Cowboy.


There was a bold cowboy
  Came out of the west;
Of all the bold riders,
  This cowboy's the best.

The horse he brought with him
  Will not run away;
But stands by the side of
  His master all day.




Blackman the Giant.


This is the long and
  The short of it too:
One dolly stood still,
  The other one grew.

She who is little
  Prefers to be tall;
Blackman the giant
  Would like to be small.

[Illustration: Blackman the Giant.]

[Illustration: The Twins.]




The Twins.


If one were not blue,
  While the other is red,
You'd fancy that Su-
  San was Mary instead.

If one were not red,
  While the other is blue,
'Twould surely be said,
  That Miss Mary was Sue!




The Highlander.


Right about, left about,
  Halt and stand at ease!
Shoulder arms, attention,
  Steady, if you please.

Order arms, present arms,
  Forward, by your right!
Double, double, double,
  Double to the fight!

[Illustration: The Highlander.]

[Illustration: Policeman.]




Policeman.


When little dolls in Nurs'ry Street,
  Do anything that's wrong;
Throw stones, or knock each other down,
  Policeman comes along.

"Move on, move on," Policeman cries;
  Be sure they never fail;
For if they did not move at once,
  He'd take them off to jail.




Mollie.


Mollie's frock is crimson,
  Her petticoat's of lace;
Mollie's hair is golden,
  And curls about her face.

Mollie's friends are many,
  She's off to visit one;
Mollie takes her sunshade,
  To keep away the sun.

[Illustration: Mollie.]

[Illustration: The Swinging Clown.]




The Swinging Clown.

    Swing up!
    Swing down!
Here goes the clown.

    Swing left!
    Swing right!
Mind you hold tight.

    Swing low!
    Swing high!
Right to the sky.




Algeria.


Dolly's home's far away,
  Far away in Algiers,
On the African coast,
  She won't see it for years.

But she whispers at night,
  And her eyes fill with tears;
"How I wish--how I wish,
  I were back in Algiers!"

[Illustration: Algeria.]

[Illustration: Dame Crump.]




Dame Crump.


Some dolls are ev'ry bit as good
  As little girls and boys;
They never pout or shake themselves,
  And never make a noise.

But other dollies make mistakes;
  Won't do as they are told;
Won't stand upright, or shut their eyes,
  However much you scold!

And then's the time for old Dame Crump
  To enter with her stick,
And make them mind their p's and q's;
  'Tis well if they are quick!




Prince Charming.


This is Prince Charming,
  Whom often you meet,
Riding or walking
  In Nursery Street.

See the red feather
  He wears in his hat,
Always you know he's
  Prince Charming by that.

[Illustration: Prince Charming.]

[Illustration: Mister Merryman.]




Mister Merryman.


He's always standing on his toes,
  And never on his heels;
He's always holding up his arms--
  I wonder how it feels.

Two balls are always in his hands,
  He never lets them drop;
He's always smiling just like this,
  And never seems to stop.




Dinah.


Dinah's cheeks are black as coal;
  Dinah's lips are red;
Dinah's eyes are bright, although
  Dinah's off to bed.

Dinah's bows are green and blue;
  Dinah's teeth are white;
Dinah's bottle's meant to feed
  Dinah in the night.

[Illustration: Dinah.]

[Illustration: Smiler.]




Smiler.


He smiles throughout the morning,
  And all the afternoon;
He smiles whene'er the sun shines,
  And also at the moon.

He smiles upon the carpet,
  Or when you pick him up;
He smiles all through his dinner,
  And when he goes to sup.




The Coachman.


There was a grand coachman,
  Who drove the Lord Mayor;
And never drove less than
  A carriage and pair.

He wore a red waistcoat,
  He carried a whip,
And when the boys saw him,
  They shouted "Hip! hip!"

[Illustration: The Coachman.]

[Illustration: Little Yam Mango.]




Little Yam Mango.


Little Yam Mango
  Has beautiful eyes,
Also the brightest
  Of scarlet neckties.

Little Yam Mango
  Will never go out;
Being so lazy,
  He's grown very stout.




Brownie.


There is a brown dolly
  Who has a guitar;
She plays on it always,
  Tra lal, tra lal la!

She has a new ditty
  For every day;
I wish you could hear it,
  Tra lal, tra lal lay!

[Illustration: Brownie.]

[Illustration: The Imp.]




The Imp.


You may call him an imp,
  Or a gnome or a sprite;
And whate'er you call him
  You are sure to be right.

He is here, he is there,
  He will never stay long;
If you think he is caught,
  You are sure to be wrong.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
