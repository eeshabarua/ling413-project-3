  PLEASING

  POETRY AND PICTURES:

  FOR THE

  MIND AND THE EYE.

  [Illustration]

  Here’s a pretty new Book, full of verses to sing,
  And Mary can read it--oh, what a fine thing;
  Then such pretty verses, and pictures too, look!
  Oh, I’m glad I can read such a beautiful book.

PLEASING

POETRY AND PICTURES.

[Illustration]




The Little Busy Bee.

_An Example of Industry, for Young Children._


  How doth the little busy Bee
    Improve each shining hour,
  And gather honey all the day
    From every opening flower?

  How skilfully she builds her cell,--
    How neat she spreads her wax,
  And labors hard to store it well
    With the sweet food she makes.

  In works of labor, or of skill,
    I must be busy too,
  For Satan finds some mischief still
    For idle hands to do.

  In books, or work, or healthful play,
    Let my first years be past,
  That I may give for every day
    Some good account at last.

[Illustration]




The Dead Bird.

_What we call Sport is too often Cruelty._


  Ah! there it falls, and now ’tis dead!
  The shot went thro’ its pretty head,
    And broke its shining wing?
  How dull and dim its closing eyes;
  How cold, and stiff, and still it lies!
    Poor harmless little thing!

  It was a lark, and in the sky,
  In mornings fine, it mounted high,
    To sing a pretty song;
  Cutting the fresh and healthy air,
  It whistled out its music there,
    As light it skimmed along.

  How little thought its pretty breast,
  This morning, when it left its nest
    Hid in the springing corn,
  To find some breakfast for its young,
  And pipe away its morning song,
    It never should return.

[Illustration: THE DEAD BIRD.]

  Those pretty wings shall never more
  Its tender nestlings cover o’er,
    Or bring them dainties rare:
  But long with gaping beaks they’ll cry,
  And then they will with hunger die,
    All in the open air!

  Poor little bird! If people knew
  The sorrows little birds go through,
    I think that even boys
  Would never call it sport and fun
  To stand and fire a frightful gun,
    For nothing but the noise.

[Illustration]




My Kind Mother.

_A Dutiful Child is the Joy of its Parents._


  I must not tease my mother,
    For she is very kind;
  And every thing she says to me,
    I must directly mind;
  For when I was a baby,
    And could not speak or walk,
  She let me in her bosom sleep,
    And taught me how to talk.

  I must not tease my mother;
    And when she likes to read,
  Or has the headache, I will step
    Most silently, indeed.
  I will not choose a noisy play,
    Or trifling troubles tell;
  But sit down quiet by her side,
    And try to make her well.

  I must not tease my mother;
    I have heard my father say,
  When I was in my cradle sick,
    She tended me all day.
  She lays me in my little bed,
    She gives me clothes and food,
  And I have nothing else to pay,
    But trying to be good.

  I must not tease my mother;
    She loves me all the day,
  And she has patience with my faults,
    And teaches me to pray;
  How much I’ll strive to please her
    She every hour shall see,
  For, should she go away, or die,
    What would become of me!

[Illustration]




Good Night.

_Little Children should go to Bed Early._


  The sun is hidden from our sight,
    The birds are sleeping sound;
  ’Tis time to say to all, “Good night,”
    And give a kiss all round.

  Good night! my father, mother dear,
    Now kiss your little son;
  Good night! my friends, both far and near;
    Good night! to every one.

  Good night! ye merry, merry birds,
    Sleep well till morning light;
  Perhaps if you could sing in words,
    You too would say, “Good night!”

  To all the pretty flowers, Good night!
    You blossom while I sleep!
  And all the stars that shine so bright,
    With you their watches keep.

[Illustration: GOOD NIGHT.]

  The moon is lighting up the skies,
    The stars are sparkling there;
  ’Tis time to shut my weary eyes,
    And say my evening prayer.

[Illustration]




The Boy and the Squirrel.

_No time to Play when there is Work to be done._


  “Pretty Squirrel on the tree,
  Frisking there so merrily,
  Pray come down and play with me!”

  “No, indeed, I must not stay,
  I’ve no time with you to play,
  But must gather nuts to-day.

  In the hollow of this tree
  I have little young ones three,
  Looking for me wishfully.”

  Up the tree he whisk’d away,
  Climbing where his young ones lay,
  Snugly in their bed of hay.

[Illustration: THE SQUIRREL.]

  Wondering gazed the little child,
  At his antics free and wild,
  Calling oft in accents mild,--

  “Do come from thy nest so high?”
  Spake the Squirrel in reply,--
  “Boy, no time to play have I.”

[Illustration]




The Works of Creation.

_Showing the Power and Goodness of God._


  Come, children, now behold the earth
    In varied beauty stand;
  The product view of six days birth,--
    How wondrous and how grand!

  The fields, the meadows, and the plain,
    The little laughing hills,
  The waters too, the mighty main,
    The rivers and the rills.

  Come, then, behold them all, and say,
    How came these things to be,
  That here before, which ever way
    We turn ourselves, we see.

[Illustration: THE WORKS OF CREATION.]

  ’Tis GOD who made the earth and sea;
    To whom all angels bow;
  The GOD who made both you and me,
    The GOD who sees us now.

[Illustration]




Early Rising.

_Early to Bed and Early to Rise._


  Little Frank is pale and wan,
    And fretful spends the day;
  The roses of his cheeks are gone,
    And all his wish for play.
  But look at James! his laughing eyes
    A better story tell;
  He, cheerful boy, is much too wise
    To make himself unwell.

  The reason Frank is pale and dull,
    And can’t enjoy his play,
  While James, with spirits ever full,
    Makes all around him gay,--
  Is this,--James early goes to bed,
    And wakes refreshed and bright,
  While Frank, by foolish fancy led,
    Sits up quite late at night.




[Illustration: EARLY RISING.]




The Little Brother.

_Children should always be kind to each other._


  Little brother, darling boy,
    You are very dear to me!
  I am pleased and full of joy,
    When your smiling face I see.

  How I wish that you could speak,
    And could know the words I say!
  Pretty stories I would seek,
    To amuse you every day;

  All about the honey-bees
    Flying past us in the sun,--
  Birds that sing among the trees,--
    Lambs that in the meadows run.

  I’ll be very kind to you,--
    Never slap or make you cry,
  As some naughty children do,
    Quite forgetting GOD is nigh.

  Shake your rattle,--here it is,
    Listen to its merry noise,
  And, when you are tired of this,
    I will bring you other toys.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
