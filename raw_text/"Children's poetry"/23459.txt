CHAPTER I.


  Mistress O'Hara lives down by the sea,
  A skittish and beautiful widow is she;
  She has black shiny tresses, and curly buff toes,
  And a heavenly tilt to the tip of her nose!

  She has three little children, the eldest is four
  (Nurse says he is naughty enough to be more);
  The Twins are dear dumplings, and they and their brother
  Are always in scrapes--
        Of one kind, or another.

    [Illustration]


  This morning poor Mistress O'Hara looks blue,
  As indeed she has every reason to do;
  For the third time this week Nurse has come in to say,
  "If you please 'm, the children have all run away!"

  "Oh! bother those children--well, first let us look
  In the larder, to see what provisions they took;
  If the pumpkin pie's gone, they are off for the day,
  If they only took raisins, they're not far away."

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

  They look in the larder, and what do you think?
  Find nothing whatever to eat or to drink.
  "Alack!" says the Cook; "it is just as I feared:
  The whole of my dinner has clean disappeared."

  "This is really too bad," says Mama, in a rage,
  As she slips on her pattens and turns down the page
  Of the book she is reading, and starts out to find
  The darlings, to give them a piece of her mind!

  She takes a big stick and makes tracks for the sea,
  Where she's pretty well sure all the truants will be;
  Yama-Guchi, she knows, leads the Twins by the nose,
  And they patiently follow wherever he goes.

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

  Sure enough, the first things that she sees on the shore
  Are footprints, and further on several more--
  And still further on there are two little rows
  Of shoes, and some other superfluous clo'es.

  But where are the children? The children are _gone_!!
  Oh! doesn't poor Mistress O'Hara take on!
  She weeps and she wails and she tears out her hair,
  And rolls on the sands in the depths of despair.

  The sand it is gritty, the sand it is dry,
  It scratches her nose and gets into her eye;
  Her throat feels as if she had swallowed a peck,
  And the rolling soon gives her a crick in her neck.

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

  So she picks up her pattens, her stick and her fan,
  And bundles her hair up as well as she can.
  Next minute it all stands on end with surprise:
  She stares and she stares, disbelieving her eyes--

  For there, as if just newly dropped from the skies,
  Are the children, all looking as chirpy as flies;
  But what flabbergasts the poor lady the most
  Is the sight of a MER-BABY, dumped on a post.

  Such a queer little object she never has seen,
  It has eyes big as saucers, all glazy and green;
  A mere speck of a nose, scarcely raised from its face,
  And a mouth that meanders all over the place.

  Yama-Guchi is dancing and shouting with glee--
  "Did you come from the earth, or the sky, or the sea?"
  While the Twins, with amazement struck utterly dumb,
  Stand solemnly gazing, each sucking a thumb.

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

  They implore it to speak, but they are not prepared
  For the size of its mouth, and are horribly scared;
  Making sure it is going to swallow them all--
  Yet its voice when it speaks is quite squeaky and small.

  "My name's Fishy-Winkle--I live in the sea,
  To-day I played truant from school, for a spree;
  But, oh! how I wish that I never had come,
  For the tide has gone out and I cannot get home."

  "Cheer up, Fishy-Winkle, and don't make a fuss,
  Get into the go-cart and run off with us;
  We've rations for dinner and also for tea,
  You will find it _much_ nicer than under the sea."

  They bring up the go-cart and Fishy jumps down.
  "The more haste, the less speed," for he falls on his crown;
  No matter, he's in now; they're off and--Houp La!
  They are soon out of reach of their furious Ma!

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]




  CHAPTER II.


  See Fishy-Winkle drive in state
    Across the shining sand;
  With Yama-Guchi yoked in front,
    A Twin on either hand!

  But soon each weary back is humped,
    And bowed each jetty pate;
  For Fishy, though he looks so small,
    Is _not_ a feather-weight!

  At last they reach a cavern cool,
    And sit down in a bunch,
  Declaring they won't budge an inch,
    Till they have had some lunch.

  The food-stuffs are a trifle mixed,
    From joggling in the cart;
  There's jam spread on the slim sardine,
    Salt on the pumpkin tart!

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

  Right in the middle there appears
    An unexpected guest;
  Who kindly makes himself at home,
    And feeds upon the best.

  The children look at him with awe,
    And whisper: "Who is that?"
  "Why, don't you know?" says Fishy-Wink,
    "That is the HADDOCK-CAT!"

  The Haddock-Cat is very kind,
    And when the meal is done
  Cries: "Get upon my back, you four,
    I'll take you for a run."

  He crouches down upon the sand,
    And up the children jump;
  Then he gets up--contrairy wise,
    The children fall down flump!!

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

  But nothing daunted, up they get,
    And cling with might and main;
  I fear they must have caused that Cat
    Con-si-der-able pain!

  They joggled for a mile or more,
    Then gasped out: "Th-that's enough:
  We th-thank you kindly--now let's have
    A game of Blind Man's Buff."

  That _was_ a game, the children shrieked
    And laughed until they cried;
  The Cat could never catch at all,
    However hard he tried.

  He chased them up, he chased them down,
    He chased them all about;
  He chased them round and round and round,
    Until his strength gave out.

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

  They led him to a shady wood,
    To sniff the cooling breeze,
  And watch the poly-poddy frogs
    A-jumping in the trees.

  The frogs were shiny, fat and green;
    They sat about in rows,
  And held on to the branches by
    Their multifarious toes!

  While there they sat, a cheerful shout
    Rang out across the sea;
  And Fishy-Winkle sighed and said:
    "I guess they're calling me.

  "The tide is in, my time is up,
    I must go home again;
  My brothers six are beckoning me
    Across the rolling main."

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

  The children followed in his train
    As far as they could get,
  Until the water got too deep,
    And all their clothes too wet.

  "Be sure and come again," they cried,
    "To play, some other day."
  And Fishy waved a friendly hand,
    From very far away.




  CHAPTER III.


  Mistress O'Hara has taken her stand,
  With rage in her heart and a stick in her hand;
  So fierce is her frown and so wild is her eye,
  That poor Yama-Guchi feels ready to die.

    [Illustration]


    [Illustration]

  Her patience is stretched to the end of its tether,
  She knocks all the heads of the children together;
  Then--when she's reduced them to sorrow and tears--
  She repents of her harshness--the poor little dears!

  She agrees to forget and forgive just once more,
  And homewards they stroll by the sunshiny shore;
  You can see by the picture how happy they look--
  On the next page you'll see the effect on--

    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
