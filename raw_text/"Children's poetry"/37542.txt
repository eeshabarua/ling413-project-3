AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.


      Why should our garments, made to hide
      Our parents' shame, provoke our pride?
      The art of dress did ne'er begin
      Till Eve our mother learnt to sin.

      When first she put the covering on,
      Her robe of innocence was gone;
      And yet her children vainly boast
      In the sad marks of glory lost.

      How proud we are! how fond to shew
      Our clothes, and call them rich and new,
      When the poor sheep and silkworms wore
      That very clothing long before!

      The tulip and the butterfly
      Appear in gayer coats than I:
      Let me be dress'd fine as I will,
      Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still.

      Then will I set my heart to find
      Inward adornings of the mind;
      Knowledge and virtue, truth and grace,
      These are the robes of richest dress.

      No more shall worms with me compare,
      This is the raiment angels wear:
      The Son of God, when here below,
      Put on this blest apparel too.

      It never fades, it ne'er grows old,
      Nor fears the rain, nor moth, nor mould:
      It takes no spot, but still refines;
      The more 'tis worn, the more it shines.

      In this on earth would I appear,
      Then go to heaven, and wear it there:
      God will approve it in his sight;
      'Tis his own work, and his delight.




[Illustration]

THE SLUGGARD.


      'Tis the voice of the Sluggard: I heard him complain,
      'You have waked me too soon! I must slumber again!'
      As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed
      Turn his sides, and his shoulders, and his heavy head.

      'A little more sleep, and a little more slumber!'
      Thus he wastes half his days and his hours without number;
      And when he gets up he sits folding his hands,
      Or walks about sauntering, or trifling he stands.

      I pass'd by his garden, and saw the wild brier,
      The thorn, and the thistle grow broader and higher;
      The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags;
      And his money still wastes, till he starves or he begs.

      I made him a visit, still hoping to find
      He had took better care for improving his mind:
      He told me his dreams, talk'd of eating and drinking;
      But he scarce reads his Bible, and never loves thinking.

      Said I then to my heart, 'Here's a lesson for me!
      That man's but a picture of what I might be;
      But thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding,
      Who have taught me by times to love working and reading!'




[Illustration]

THE ANT, OR EMMET.


      These Emmets, how little they are in our eyes!
      We tread them to dust, and a troop of them dies,
          Without our regard or concern:
      Yet, as wise as we are, if we went to their school,
      There's many a sluggard and many a fool
          Some lessons of wisdom might learn.

      They wear not their time out in sleeping or play,
      But gather up corn in a sunshiny day,
          And for winter they lay up their stores:
      They manage their work in such regular forms,
      One would think they foresaw all the frosts and the storms,
          And so brought their food within doors.

      But I have less sense than a poor creeping Ant,
      If I take not due care for the things I shall want,
          Nor provide against dangers in time:
      When death or old age shall once stare in my face,
      What a wretch shall I be in the end of my days,
          If I trifle away all their prime!

      Now, now, while my strength and my youth are in bloom,
      Let me think what shall serve me when sickness shall come,
          And pray that my sins be forgiven.
      Let me read in good books, and believe, and obey;
      That, when death turns me out of this cottage of clay,
          I may dwell in a palace in heaven.




INNOCENT PLAY.


      Abroad in the meadows, to see the young lambs
      Run sporting about by the side of their dams,
        With fleeces so clean and so white;
      Or a nest of young doves in a large open cage
      When they play all in love, without anger or rage,
        How much may we learn from the sight!

      If we had been ducks, we might dabble in mud;
      Or dogs, we might play till it ended in blood:
        So foul and so fierce are their natures;
      But Thomas and William, and such pretty names,
      Should be cleanly and harmless as doves or as lambs,
        Those lovely sweet innocent creatures.

      Not a thing that we do, nor a word that we say,
      Should injure another in jesting or play,
        For he's still in earnest that's hurt:
      How rude are the boys that throw pebbles and mire;
      There's none but a madman will fling about fire,
        And tell you "'Tis all but in sport!"




[Illustration]

AGAINST EVIL COMPANY.


      Why should I join with those in play
        In whom I've no delight;
      Who curse and swear, but never pray;
        Who call ill names, and fight?

      I hate to hear a wanton song:
        Their words offend my ears:
      I should not dare defile my tongue
        With language such as theirs.

      Away from fools I'll turn my eyes,
        Nor with the scoffers go:
      I would be walking with the wise,
        That wiser I may grow.

      From one rude boy, that's used to mock,
        They learn the wicked jest:
      One sickly sheep infects the flock,
        And poisons all the rest.

      My God, I hate to walk or dwell
        With sinful children here:
      Then let me not be sent to hell,
        Where none but sinners are.




[Illustration]

THE THIEF.


      Why should I deprive my neighbor
        Of his goods against his will?
      Hands were made for honest labor,
        Not to plunder, or to steal.

      'Tis a foolish self-deceiving
        By such tricks to hope for gain:
      All that's ever got by thieving
        Turns to sorrow, shame, and pain.

      Have not Eve and Adam taught us
        Their sad profit to compute,
      To what dismal state they brought us
        When they stole forbidden fruit?

      Oft we see a young beginner
        Practise little pilfering ways,
      Till grown up a harden'd sinner,
        Then the gallows ends his days.

      Theft will not be always hidden,
        Though we fancy none can spy:
      When we take a thing forbidden,
        God beholds it with his eye.

      Guard my heart, O God of heaven,
        Lest I covet what's not mine;
      Lest I steal what is not given,
        Guard my heart and hands from sin.




THE ROSE.


      How fair is the Rose! what a beautiful flower!
        The glory of April and May:
      But the leaves are beginning to fade in an hour,
        And they wither and die in a day.

      Yet the Rose has one powerful virtue to boast,
        Above all the flowers of the field!
      When its leaves are all dead and fine colors are lost,
        Still how sweet a perfume it will yield!

      So frail is the youth and the beauty of man,
        Though they bloom and look gay like the Rose;
      But all our fond care to preserve them is vain,
        Time kills them as fast as he goes.

      Then I'll not be proud of my youth and my beauty,
        Since both of them wither and fade;
      But gain a good name by well doing my duty:
        This will scent like a Rose when I'm dead.

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in

full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

Defect you cause.

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
