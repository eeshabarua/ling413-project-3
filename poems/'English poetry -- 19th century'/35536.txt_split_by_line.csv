210,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,
211,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"About the year 1834, when the earliest of the _Sketches by Boz_ were"
212,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"appearing in print, a young composer named John Hullah set to music a"
213,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"portion of an opera called _The Gondolier_, which he thought might prove"
214,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,successful on the stage. Twelve months later Hullah became acquainted with
215,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"Charles Dickens, whose name was then unknown to those outside his own"
216,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"immediate circle, and it occurred to him that he and 'Boz' might combine"
217,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"their forces by converting _The Gondolier_ into a popular play. Dickens,"
218,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"who always entertained a passion for the theatre, entered into the project"
219,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"at once, and informed Hullah that he had a little unpublished story by him"
220,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,which he thought would dramatise well--even better than _The Gondolier_
221,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,notion; confessing that he would rather deal with familiar English scenes
222,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,than with the unfamiliar Venetian environment of the play favoured by
223,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"Hullah. The title of _The Gondolier_ was consequently abandoned, and a"
224,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"novel subject found and put forward as _The Village Coquettes_, a comic"
225,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"opera of which songs, duets, and concerted pieces were to form"
226,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"constituent parts. Dickens, of course, became responsible for the"
227,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,_libretto_ and Hullah for the music; and when completed the little play
228,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"was offered to, and accepted by, Braham, the lessee of the St. James's"
229,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"Theatre, who expressed an earnest desire to be the first to introduce"
230,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,'Boz' to the public as a dramatic writer. A favourite comedian of that
231,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"day, John Pritt Harley, after reading the words of the opera prior to its"
232,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"representation, declared it was 'a sure card,' and felt so confident of"
233,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,its success that he offered to wager ten pounds that it would run fifty
234,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,nights!--an assurance which at once decided Braham to produce it.
235,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,
236,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"_The Village Coquettes_, described on the title-page of the printed copies"
237,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"as 'A Comic Opera, in Two Acts,' was played for the first time on December"
238,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"6, 1836, with Braham and Harley in the cast. In his preface to the play"
239,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"(published contemporaneously by Richard Bentley, and dedicated to Harley)"
240,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"Dickens explained that 'the _libretto_ of an opera must be, to a certain"
241,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"extent, a mere vehicle for the music,' and that 'it is scarcely fair or"
242,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,reasonable to judge it by those strict rules of criticism which would be
243,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,justly applicable to a five-act tragedy or a finished comedy.' There is no
244,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,doubt that the merits of the play were based upon the songs set to
245,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"Hullah's music rather than upon the play itself, and it is said that"
246,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,Harley's reputation as a vocalist was established by his able rendering of
247,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,them.
248,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,
249,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,_The Village Coquettes_ enjoyed a run of nineteen nights in London during
250,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"the season, and was then transferred to Edinburgh, where it was performed"
251,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"under the management of Mr. Ramsay, a friend of Sir Walter Scott. Sala, as"
252,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"a boy of ten, witnessed its first representation in London, and ever"
253,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,retained a vivid impression of the event; while especial interest
254,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,appertains to the fact that a copy of the play became the means of first
255,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"bringing Dickens into personal communication with John Forster, his"
256,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,life-long friend and biographer. It is more than probable that 'Boz' felt
257,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,a little elated by the reception accorded by the public to the 'dramatic
258,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"bantling,' but as time progressed he realised that the somewhat"
259,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,unfavourable comments of the critics were not entirely devoid of truth.
260,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"Indeed, when in 1843 it was proposed to revive the play, he expressed a"
261,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,hope that it might be allowed 'to sink into its native obscurity.' 'I did
262,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"it,' he explained, 'in a fit of damnable good-nature long ago, for Hullah,"
263,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,who wrote some very pretty music to it. I just put down for everybody what
264,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"everybody at the St. James's Theatre wanted to say and do, and what they"
265,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"could say and do best, and I have been most sincerely repentant ever"
266,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,since.' The novelist confessed that both the operetta and a little farce
267,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,called _The Strange Gentleman_ (the latter written as 'a practical joke'
268,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,for the St. James's Theatre about the same time) were done 'without the
269,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,least consideration or regard to reputation'; he also declared that he
270,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"'wouldn't repeat them for a thousand pounds apiece,' and devoutly wished"
271,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"these early dramatic efforts to be forgotten. _À propos_ of this, the late"
272,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,Frederick Locker-Lampson has recorded that when he asked Dickens (about a
273,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,year before the great writer's death) whether he possessed a copy of _The
274,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"Village Coquettes_, his reply was, 'No; and if I knew it was in my house,"
275,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"and if I could not get rid of it in any other way, I would burn the wing"
276,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,of the house where it was!'
277,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,
278,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"Although, perhaps, not of a high order of merit, _The Village Coquettes_"
279,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"is not without bibliographical interest, and may be regarded as a musical"
280,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,and literary curiosity. Copies of the first edition of the little play are
281,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"now seldom met with, and whenever a perfect impression comes into the"
282,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"market it commands a good price, even as much as £10 or £12,--indeed, a"
283,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,particularly fine copy was sold at Sotheby's in 1889 for twenty-five
284,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,pounds. In 1878 the words of the opera were reprinted in facsimile by
285,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,"Richard Bentley, for which a frontispiece was etched by F. W. Pailthorpe a"
286,THE VILLAGE COQUETTES,year later.

768,THE LAMPLIGHTER,
769,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"In 1838 Dickens agreed to prepare a little play for Macready, the famous"
770,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"actor, then the manager of Drury Lane Theatre. It was called _The"
771,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"Lamplighter_, and when completed the author read aloud the 'unfortunate"
772,THE LAMPLIGHTER,little farce' (as he subsequently termed it) in the greenroom of the
773,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"theatre. Although the play went through rehearsal, it was never presented"
774,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"before an audience, for the actors would not agree about it, and, at"
775,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"Macready's suggestion, Dickens consented to withdraw it, declaring that he"
776,THE LAMPLIGHTER,had 'no other feeling of disappointment connected with this matter' but
777,THE LAMPLIGHTER,that which arose from the failure in attempting to serve his friend. The
778,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"manuscript of the play, not in Dickens's handwriting, reposes in the"
779,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"Forster Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and in 1879 it was"
780,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"printed for the first time, in the form of a pamphlet, of which only two"
781,THE LAMPLIGHTER,hundred and fifty copies were issued.
782,THE LAMPLIGHTER,
783,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"When rejected by Macready as unsuitable for stage presentation, _The"
784,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"Lamplighter_ was adapted by Dickens to another purpose--that is to say,"
785,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"he converted it into a tale called _The Lamplighter's Story_, for"
786,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"publication in _The Pic-Nic Papers_, issued in 1841 for the benefit of the"
787,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"widow of Macrone, Dickens's first publisher, who died in great poverty."
788,THE LAMPLIGHTER,Between the farce and the story there are but slight differences. The duet
789,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"of two verses, sung by Tom and Betsy to the air of 'The Young May-moon,'"
790,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"cannot of course be regarded as a remarkable composition, but it served"
791,THE LAMPLIGHTER,"its purpose sufficiently well, and for that reason deserves recognition."

851,THE IVY GREEN,"This famous ballad of three verses, from the sixth chapter of _Pickwick_,"
852,THE IVY GREEN,is perhaps the most acceptable of all Dickens's poetical efforts. It was
853,THE IVY GREEN,"originally set to music, at Dickens's request, by his brother-in-law,"
854,THE IVY GREEN,"Henry Burnett, a professional vocalist, who, by the way, was the admitted"
855,THE IVY GREEN,prototype of Nicholas Nickleby. Mr. Burnett sang the ballad scores of
856,THE IVY GREEN,"times in the presence of literary men and artists, and it proved an"
857,THE IVY GREEN,especial favourite with Landor. 'The Ivy Green' was not written for
858,THE IVY GREEN,"_Pickwick_, Mr. Burnett assured me; but on its being so much admired the"
859,THE IVY GREEN,"author said it should go into a monthly number, and it did. The most"
860,THE IVY GREEN,"popular setting is undoubtedly that of Henry Russell, who has recorded"
861,THE IVY GREEN,"that he received, as his fee, the magnificent sum of ten shillings! The"
862,THE IVY GREEN,"ballad, in this form, went into many editions, and the sales must have"
863,THE IVY GREEN,amounted to tens of thousands.

1338,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',young man and indicated a desire to promote the welfare of his production
1339,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',by composing some introductory lines. To Macready he wrote: 'The more I

1344,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',"prologue out of the conventional dress of prologues, quite. Get the"
1345,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',"curtain up with a dash, and begin the play with a sledge-hammer blow. If,"

1347,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',"heartily.' Happily for the author, his little tragedy was the first new"

1350,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',the fact that Dickens's dignified and vigorous lines were recited by

1354,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',misunderstood. As explained by the Editors of _The Letters of Charles
1355,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',"Dickens_, it was (to a certain extent) an experiment in testing the effect"
1356,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',"of a tragedy of modern times and in modern dress, the novelist's Prologue"
1357,PROLOGUE TO 'THE PATRICIAN'S DAUGHTER',being intended to show that there need be no incongruity between plain

1868,'THE FROZEN DEEP',The second drama written by Wilkie Collins for the Tavistock House Theatre
1869,'THE FROZEN DEEP',"was first acted there in January 1857, and subsequently at the Gallery of"
1870,'THE FROZEN DEEP',Illustration in the presence of Queen Victoria and the Royal Family. As in
1871,'THE FROZEN DEEP',"the case of _The Lighthouse_, the play had the advantage of a Prologue in"
1872,'THE FROZEN DEEP',"rhyme by Charles Dickens, who again electrified his audiences by"
1873,'THE FROZEN DEEP',"marvellous acting, the character of Richard Wardour (a young naval"
1874,'THE FROZEN DEEP',officer) being selected by him for representation.
1875,'THE FROZEN DEEP',

1879,'THE FROZEN DEEP',It is not generally known that a by no means inconsiderable portion of the

1885,'THE FROZEN DEEP',The main idea of _A Tale of Two Cities_ was conceived by Dickens when

1887,'THE FROZEN DEEP',"writes in the preface to the story, 'to embody it in my own person; and I"
1888,'THE FROZEN DEEP',traced out in my fancy the state of mind of which it would necessitate the
1889,'THE FROZEN DEEP',"presentation to an observant spectator, with particular care and interest."
1890,'THE FROZEN DEEP',"As the idea became familiar to me, it gradually shaped itself into its"
1891,'THE FROZEN DEEP',"present form. Throughout its execution, it has had complete possession of"
1892,'THE FROZEN DEEP',"me: I have so far verified what is done and suffered in these pages, as"
1893,'THE FROZEN DEEP',that I have certainly done and suffered it all myself.'

1948,A CHILD'S HYMN,The Christmas number of _Household Words_ for 1856 is especially
1949,A CHILD'S HYMN,noteworthy as containing the Hymn of five verses which Dickens contributed
1950,A CHILD'S HYMN,"to the second chapter. This made a highly favourable impression, and a"
1951,A CHILD'S HYMN,"certain clergyman, the Rev. R. H. Davies, was induced to express to the"
1952,A CHILD'S HYMN,editor of _Household Words_ his gratitude to the author of these lines for
1953,A CHILD'S HYMN,having thus conveyed to innumerable readers such true religious
1954,A CHILD'S HYMN,"sentiments. In acknowledging the receipt of the letter, Dickens observed"
1955,A CHILD'S HYMN,that such a mark of approval was none the less gratifying to him because
1956,A CHILD'S HYMN,"he was himself the author of the Hymn. 'There cannot be many men, I"
1957,A CHILD'S HYMN,"believe,' he added, 'who have a more humble veneration for the New"
1958,A CHILD'S HYMN,"Testament, or a more profound conviction of its all-sufficiency, than I"
1959,A CHILD'S HYMN,"have. If I am ever (as you tell me I am) mistaken on this subject, it is"
1960,A CHILD'S HYMN,because I discountenance all obtrusive professions of and tradings in
1961,A CHILD'S HYMN,"religion, as one of the main causes why real Christianity has been"
1962,A CHILD'S HYMN,retarded in this world; and because my observation of life induces me to
1963,A CHILD'S HYMN,hold in unspeakable dread and horror those unseemly squabbles about the
1964,A CHILD'S HYMN,letter which drive the spirit out of hundreds of thousands.'--_Vide_
