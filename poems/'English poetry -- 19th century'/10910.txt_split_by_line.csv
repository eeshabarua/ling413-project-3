83,AN ELEGY,AN ELEGY
84,AN ELEGY,
85,AN ELEGY,High on his Patmos of the Southern Seas
86,AN ELEGY,"Our northern dreamer sleeps,"
87,AN ELEGY,"Strange stars above him, and above his grave"
88,AN ELEGY,"Strange leaves and wings their tropic splendours wave,"
89,AN ELEGY,"While, far beneath, mile after shimmering mile,"
90,AN ELEGY,"The great Pacific, with its faery deeps,"
91,AN ELEGY,Smiles all day long its silken secret smile.
92,AN ELEGY,
93,AN ELEGY,"Son of a race nomadic, finding still"
94,AN ELEGY,"Its home in regions furthest from its home,"
95,AN ELEGY,"Ranging untired the borders of the world,"
96,AN ELEGY,And resting but to roam;
97,AN ELEGY,"Loved of his land, and making all his boast"
98,AN ELEGY,"The birthright of the blood from which he came,"
99,AN ELEGY,"Heir to those lights that guard the Scottish coast,"
100,AN ELEGY,And caring only for a filial fame;
101,AN ELEGY,"Proud, if a poet, he was Scotsman most,"
102,AN ELEGY,And bore a Scottish name.
103,AN ELEGY,
104,AN ELEGY,"Death, that long sought our poet, finds at last,"
105,AN ELEGY,"Death, that pursued him over land and sea:"
106,AN ELEGY,"Not his the flight of fear, the heart aghast"
107,AN ELEGY,"With stony dread of immortality,"
108,AN ELEGY,He fled 'not cowardly';
109,AN ELEGY,"Fled, as some captain, in whose shaping hand"
110,AN ELEGY,"Lie the momentous fortunes of his land,"
111,AN ELEGY,"Sheds not vainglorious blood upon the field,"
112,AN ELEGY,"Death! why at last he finds his treasure isle,"
113,AN ELEGY,And he the pirate of its hidden hoard;
114,AN ELEGY,"Life! 'twas the ship he sailed to seek it in,"
115,AN ELEGY,"And Death is but the pilot come aboard,"
116,AN ELEGY,Methinks I see him smile a boy's glad smile
117,AN ELEGY,"On maddened winds and waters, reefs unknown,"
118,AN ELEGY,"As thunders in the sail the dread typhoon,"
119,AN ELEGY,And in the surf the shuddering timbers groan;
120,AN ELEGY,"Horror ahead, and Death beside the wheel:"
121,AN ELEGY,"Then--spreading stillness of the broad lagoon,"
122,AN ELEGY,And lap of waters round the resting keel.
123,AN ELEGY,
124,AN ELEGY,"Strange Isle of Voices! must we ask in vain,"
125,AN ELEGY,"In vain beseech and win no answering word,"
126,AN ELEGY,Save mocking echoes of our lonely pain
127,AN ELEGY,From lonely hill and bird?
128,AN ELEGY,"Island beneath whose unrelenting coast,"
129,AN ELEGY,"As though it never in the sun had been,"
130,AN ELEGY,"The whole world's treasure lieth sunk and lost,"
131,AN ELEGY,"Unsunned, unseen."
132,AN ELEGY,"For, either sunk beyond the diver's skill,"
133,AN ELEGY,"There, fathoms deep, our gold is all arust,"
134,AN ELEGY,Or in that island it is hoarded still.
135,AN ELEGY,"Yea, some have said, within thy dreadful wall"
136,AN ELEGY,"There is a folk that know not death at all,"
137,AN ELEGY,"The loved we lost, the lost we love, are there."
138,AN ELEGY,"Will no kind voice make answer to our cry,"
139,AN ELEGY,"Give to our aching hearts some little trust,"
140,AN ELEGY,"Show how 'tis good to live, but best to die?"
141,AN ELEGY,Some voice that knows
142,AN ELEGY,Whither the dead man goes:
143,AN ELEGY,"We hear his music from the other side,"
144,AN ELEGY,"Maybe a little tapping on the door,"
145,AN ELEGY,"A something called, a something sighed--"
146,AN ELEGY,No more.
147,AN ELEGY,O for some voice to valiantly declare
148,AN ELEGY,The best news true!
149,AN ELEGY,"Then, Happy Island of the Happy Dead,"
150,AN ELEGY,How gladly would we spread
151,AN ELEGY,Impatient sail for you!
152,AN ELEGY,
153,AN ELEGY,"O vanished loveliness of flowers and faces,"
154,AN ELEGY,"Treasure of hair, and great immortal eyes,"
155,AN ELEGY,Are there for these no safe and secret places?
156,AN ELEGY,And is it true that beauty never dies?
157,AN ELEGY,"Soldiers and saints, haughty and lovely names,"
158,AN ELEGY,"Women who set the whole wide world in flames,"
159,AN ELEGY,"Poets who sang their passion to the skies,"
160,AN ELEGY,And lovers wild and wise:
161,AN ELEGY,"Fought they and prayed for some poor flitting gleam,"
162,AN ELEGY,Was all they loved and worshipped but a dream?
163,AN ELEGY,"Is Love a lie and fame indeed a breath,"
164,AN ELEGY,And is there no sure thing in life--but death?
165,AN ELEGY,"Or may it be, within that guarded shore,"
166,AN ELEGY,He meets Her now whom I shall meet no more
167,AN ELEGY,Till kind Death fold me 'neath his shadowy wing:
168,AN ELEGY,She whom within my heart I softly tell
169,AN ELEGY,"That he is dead whom once we loved so well,"
170,AN ELEGY,"He, the immortal master whom I sing."
171,AN ELEGY,
172,AN ELEGY,"Immortal! yea, dare we the word again,"
173,AN ELEGY,"If aught remaineth of our mortal day,"
174,AN ELEGY,That which is written--shall it not remain?
175,AN ELEGY,"That which is sung, is it not built for aye?"
176,AN ELEGY,"Faces must fade, for all their golden looks,"
177,AN ELEGY,"Unless some poet them eternalise,"
178,AN ELEGY,Make live those golden looks in golden books;
179,AN ELEGY,"Death, soon or late, will quench the brightest eyes--"
180,AN ELEGY,'Tis only what is written never dies.
181,AN ELEGY,"Yea, memories that guard like sacred gold"
182,AN ELEGY,"Some sainted face, they also must grow old,"
183,AN ELEGY,"Pass and forget, and think--or darest thou not!--"
184,AN ELEGY,On all the beauty that is quite forgot.
185,AN ELEGY,
186,AN ELEGY,"Strange craft of words, strange magic of the pen,"
187,AN ELEGY,Whereby the dead still talk with living men;
188,AN ELEGY,"Whereby a sentence, in its trivial scope,"
189,AN ELEGY,May centre all we love and all we hope;
190,AN ELEGY,"And in a couplet, like a rosebud furled,"
191,AN ELEGY,Lie all the wistful wonder of the world.
192,AN ELEGY,
193,AN ELEGY,"Old are the stars, and yet they still endure,"
194,AN ELEGY,"Old are the flowers, yet never fail the spring:"
195,AN ELEGY,"Why is the song that is so old so new,"
196,AN ELEGY,Known and yet strange each sweet small shape and hue?
197,AN ELEGY,"How may a poet thus for ever sing,"
198,AN ELEGY,"Thus build his climbing music sweet and sure,"
199,AN ELEGY,As builds in stars and flowers the Eternal mind?
200,AN ELEGY,"Ah, Poet, that is yours to seek and find!"
201,AN ELEGY,"Yea, yours that magisterial skill whereby"
202,AN ELEGY,"God put all Heaven in a woman's eye,"
203,AN ELEGY,Nature's own mighty and mysterious art
204,AN ELEGY,That knows to pack the whole within the part:
205,AN ELEGY,"The shell that hums the music of the sea,"
206,AN ELEGY,"The little word big with Eternity,"
207,AN ELEGY,The cosmic rhythm in microcosmic things--
208,AN ELEGY,"One song the lark and one the planet sings,"
209,AN ELEGY,One kind heart beating warm in bird and tree--
210,AN ELEGY,"To hear it beat, who knew so well as he?"
211,AN ELEGY,
212,AN ELEGY,Virgil of prose! far distant is the day
213,AN ELEGY,When at the mention of your heartfelt name
214,AN ELEGY,"Shall shake the head, and men, oblivious, say:"
215,AN ELEGY,"'We know him not, this master, nor his fame.'"
216,AN ELEGY,"Not for so swift forgetfulness you wrought,"
217,AN ELEGY,"Day upon day, with rapt fastidious pen,"
218,AN ELEGY,"Turning, like precious stones, with anxious thought,"
219,AN ELEGY,"This word and that again and yet again,"
220,AN ELEGY,Seeking to match its meaning with the world;
221,AN ELEGY,"Nor to the morning stars gave ears attent,"
222,AN ELEGY,"That you, indeed, might ever dare to be"
223,AN ELEGY,With other praise than immortality
224,AN ELEGY,Unworthily content.
225,AN ELEGY,
226,AN ELEGY,"Not while a boy still whistles on the earth,"
227,AN ELEGY,"Not while a single human heart beats true,"
228,AN ELEGY,"Not while Love lasts, and Honour, and the Brave,"
229,AN ELEGY,"Has earth a grave,"
230,AN ELEGY,"O well-beloved, for you!"

236,AN ODE TO SPRING,
237,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN)
238,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
239,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Is it the Spring?
240,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Or are the birds all wrong
241,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"That play on flute and viol,"
242,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"A thousand strong,"
243,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),In minstrel galleries
244,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Of the long deep wood,"
245,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Epiphanies
246,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Of bloom and bud.
247,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
248,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Grave minstrels those,"
249,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Of deep responsive chant;
250,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"But see how yonder goes,"
251,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Dew-drunk, with giddy slant,"
252,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Yon Shelley-lark,"
253,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),And hark!
254,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Him on the giddy brink
255,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Of pearly heaven
256,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),His fairy anvil clink.
257,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
258,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Or watch, in fancy,"
259,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),How the brimming note
260,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Falls, like a string of pearls,"
261,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),From out his heavenly throat;
262,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Or like a fountain
263,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"In Hesperides,"
264,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Raining its silver rain,"
265,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"In gleam and chime,"
266,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),On backs of ivory girls--
267,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Twice happy rhyme!
268,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
269,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Ah, none of these"
270,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"May make it plain,"
271,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),No image we may seek
272,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Shall match the magic of his gurgling beak.
273,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
274,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),And many a silly thing
275,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"That hops and cheeps,"
276,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"And perks his tiny tail,"
277,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"And sideway peeps,"
278,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"And flitters little wing,"
279,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Seems in his consequential way
280,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),To tell of Spring.
281,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
282,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),The river warbles soft and runs
283,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"With fuller curve and sleeker line,"
284,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Though on the winter-blackened hedge
285,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Twigs of unbudding iron shine,"
286,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),And trampled still the river sedge.
287,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
288,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),And O the Sun!
289,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),I have no friend so generous as this Sun
290,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),That comes to meet me with his big warm hands.
291,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),And O the Sky!
292,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"There is no maid, how true,"
293,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Is half so chaste
294,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),As the pure kiss of greening willow wands
295,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Against the intense pale blue
296,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Of this sweet boundless overarching waste.
297,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
298,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"And see!--dear Heaven, but it is the Spring!--"
299,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"See yonder, yonder, by the river there,"
300,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Long glittering pearly fingers flash
301,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Upon the warm bright air:
302,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Why, 'tis the heavenly palm,"
303,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"The Christian tree,"
304,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Whose budding is a psalm
305,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Of natural piety:
306,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Soft silver notches up the smooth green stem--
307,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Ah, Spring must follow them,"
308,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),It is the Spring!
309,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
310,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"O Spirit of Spring,"
311,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Whose strange instinctive art
312,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Makes the bird sing,"
313,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),And brings the bud again;
314,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),O in my heart
315,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Take up thy heavenly reign,"
316,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),And from its deeps
317,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Draw out the hidden flower,"
318,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"And where it sleeps,"
319,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"Throughout the winter long,"
320,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),O sweet mysterious power
321,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),Awake the slothful song!
322,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),
323,(TO GRANT AND NELLIE ALLEN),"_February_ 7, 1893."

330,(TO JOHN LANE),(TO JOHN LANE)
331,(TO JOHN LANE),
332,(TO JOHN LANE),"Vast and mysterious brother, ere was yet of me"
333,(TO JOHN LANE),"So much as men may poise upon a needle's end,"
334,(TO JOHN LANE),"Still shook with laughter all this monstrous might of thee,"
335,(TO JOHN LANE),And still with haughty crest it called the morning friend.
336,(TO JOHN LANE),
337,(TO JOHN LANE),"Thy latticed column jetted up the bright blue air,"
338,(TO JOHN LANE),"Tall as a mast it was, and stronger than a tower;"
339,(TO JOHN LANE),"Three hundred winters had beheld thee mighty there,"
340,(TO JOHN LANE),Before my little life had lived one little hour.
341,(TO JOHN LANE),
342,(TO JOHN LANE),"With rocky foot stern-set like iron in the land,"
343,(TO JOHN LANE),"With leafy rustling crest the morning sows with pearls,"
344,(TO JOHN LANE),"Huge as a minster, half in heaven men saw thee stand,"
345,(TO JOHN LANE),Thy rugged girth the waists of fifty Eastern girls.
346,(TO JOHN LANE),
347,(TO JOHN LANE),"Knotted and warted, slabbed and armoured like the hide"
348,(TO JOHN LANE),Of tropic elephant; unstormable and steep
349,(TO JOHN LANE),"As some grim fortress with a princess-pearl inside,"
350,(TO JOHN LANE),Where savage guardian faces beard the bastioned keep:
351,(TO JOHN LANE),
352,(TO JOHN LANE),"So hard a rind, old tree, shielding so soft a heart--"
353,(TO JOHN LANE),A woman's heart of tender little nestling leaves;
354,(TO JOHN LANE),"Nor rind so hard but that a touch so soft can part,"
355,(TO JOHN LANE),And Spring's first baby-bud an easy passage cleaves.
356,(TO JOHN LANE),
357,(TO JOHN LANE),"I picture thee within with dainty satin sides,"
358,(TO JOHN LANE),"Where all the long day through the sleeping dryad dreams,"
359,(TO JOHN LANE),"But when the moon bends low and taps thee thrice she glides,"
360,(TO JOHN LANE),"Knowing the fairy knock, to bask within her beams."
361,(TO JOHN LANE),
362,(TO JOHN LANE),"And all the long night through, for him with eyes and ears,"
363,(TO JOHN LANE),"She sways within thine arms and sings a fairy tune,"
364,(TO JOHN LANE),"Till, startled with the dawn, she softly disappears,"
365,(TO JOHN LANE),And sleeps and dreams again until the rising moon.
366,(TO JOHN LANE),
367,(TO JOHN LANE),But with the peep of day great bands of heavenly birds
368,(TO JOHN LANE),"Fill all thy branchy chambers with a thousand flutes,"
369,(TO JOHN LANE),"And with the torrid noon stroll up the weary herds,"
370,(TO JOHN LANE),To seek thy friendly shade and doze about thy roots--
371,(TO JOHN LANE),
372,(TO JOHN LANE),Till with the setting sun they turn them once more home;
373,(TO JOHN LANE),"And, ere the moon dawns, for a brief enchanted space,"
374,(TO JOHN LANE),"Weary with million miles, the sore-spent star-beams come,"
375,(TO JOHN LANE),And moths and bats hold witches' sabbath in the place.
376,(TO JOHN LANE),
377,(TO JOHN LANE),"And then I picture thee some bloodstained Holyrood,"
378,(TO JOHN LANE),"Dread haunted palace of the bat and owl, whence steal,"
379,(TO JOHN LANE),"Shrouded all day, lost murdered spirits of the wood,"
380,(TO JOHN LANE),And fright young happy nests with homeless hoot and squeal.
381,(TO JOHN LANE),
382,(TO JOHN LANE),"Then, maybe, dangling from thy gloomy gallows boughs,"
383,(TO JOHN LANE),"A human corpse swings, mournful, rattling bones and chains--"
384,(TO JOHN LANE),His eighteenth century flesh hath fattened nineteenth century cows--
385,(TO JOHN LANE),Ghastly Aeolian harp fingered of winds and rains.
386,(TO JOHN LANE),
387,(TO JOHN LANE),Poor Rizpah comes to reap each newly-fallen bone
388,(TO JOHN LANE),"That once thrilled soft, a little limb, within her womb;"
389,(TO JOHN LANE),"And mark yon alchemist, with zodiac-spangled zone,"
390,(TO JOHN LANE),Wrenching the mandrake root that fattens in the gloom.
391,(TO JOHN LANE),
392,(TO JOHN LANE),"So rounds thy day, from maiden morn to haunted night,"
393,(TO JOHN LANE),From larks and sunlit dreams to owl and gibbering ghost;
394,(TO JOHN LANE),"A catacomb of dark, a maze of living light,"
395,(TO JOHN LANE),To the wide sea of air a green and welcome coast.
396,(TO JOHN LANE),
397,(TO JOHN LANE),"I seek a god, old tree: accept my worship, thou!"
398,(TO JOHN LANE),All other gods have failed me always in my need;
399,(TO JOHN LANE),"I hang my votive song beneath thy temple bough,"
400,(TO JOHN LANE),"Unto thy strength I cry--Old monster, be my creed!"
401,(TO JOHN LANE),
402,(TO JOHN LANE),"Give me to clasp this earth with feeding roots like thine,"
403,(TO JOHN LANE),"To mount yon heaven with such star-aspiring head,"
404,(TO JOHN LANE),"Fill full with sap and buds this shrunken life of mine,"
405,(TO JOHN LANE),And from my boughs oh! might such stalwart sons be shed.
406,(TO JOHN LANE),
407,(TO JOHN LANE),"With loving cheek pressed close against thy horny breast,"
408,(TO JOHN LANE),I hear the roar of sap mounting within thy veins;
409,(TO JOHN LANE),"Tingling with buds, thy great hands open towards the west,"
410,(TO JOHN LANE),To catch the sweetheart winds that bring the sister rains.
411,(TO JOHN LANE),
412,(TO JOHN LANE),"O winds that blow from out the fruitful mouth of God,"
413,(TO JOHN LANE),"O rains that softly fall from His all-loving eyes,"
414,(TO JOHN LANE),You that bring buds to trees and daisies to the sod--
415,(TO JOHN LANE),"O God's best Angel of the Spring, in me arise."

937,(TO. MR. AND MRS. WELCH),For the old year that last night went
938,(TO. MR. AND MRS. WELCH),Has not been so much lost as spent:
939,(TO. MR. AND MRS. WELCH),You gave it in exchange to Death
940,(TO. MR. AND MRS. WELCH),For just twelve months of happy breath.

1005,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1006,(TO JOHN FRASER),"There, in my mind's-eye, pure it lay,"
1007,(TO JOHN FRASER),My lodger's vote! 'Twas mine to-day.
1008,(TO JOHN FRASER),"It seemed a sort of maidenhood,"
1009,(TO JOHN FRASER),"My little power for public good,--"
1010,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Oh keep it uncorrupted, pray!"
1011,(TO JOHN FRASER),"And, when it must be given away,"
1012,(TO JOHN FRASER),See it be given with a sense
1013,(TO JOHN FRASER),Of most uncanvassed innocence.
1014,(TO JOHN FRASER),Alas!--but few there be that know't--
1015,(TO JOHN FRASER),How grave a thing it is to vote!
1016,(TO JOHN FRASER),"For most men's votes are given, I hear,"
1017,(TO JOHN FRASER),Either for rhetoric or--beer.
1018,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1019,(TO JOHN FRASER),A young man's vote--O fair estate!
1020,(TO JOHN FRASER),Of the great tree electorate
1021,(TO JOHN FRASER),"A living leaf, of this great sea"
1022,(TO JOHN FRASER),"A motive wave of empire I,"
1023,(TO JOHN FRASER),On this stupendous wheel--a fly.
1024,(TO JOHN FRASER),"O maiden vote, how pure must be"
1025,(TO JOHN FRASER),The party that is worthy thee!
1026,(TO JOHN FRASER),And thereupon my mind began
1027,(TO JOHN FRASER),"That perfect government to plan,"
1028,(TO JOHN FRASER),The high millennium of man.
1029,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1030,(TO JOHN FRASER),Then in my dream I saw arise
1031,(TO JOHN FRASER),"An England, ah! so fair and wise,"
1032,(TO JOHN FRASER),"An England generously great,"
1033,(TO JOHN FRASER),"No selfish island, but a state"
1034,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Upon the world's bright forehead worn,"
1035,(TO JOHN FRASER),A mighty star of mighty morn.
1036,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1037,(TO JOHN FRASER),And statesmen in that dream became
1038,(TO JOHN FRASER),"No tricksters of the petty aim,"
1039,(TO JOHN FRASER),Mere speculators in the rise
1040,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Of programmes and of party cries,"
1041,(TO JOHN FRASER),Expert in all those turns and tricks
1042,(TO JOHN FRASER),"That make this senate-house of ours,"
1043,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Westminster, with its lordly towers,"
1044,(TO JOHN FRASER),The stock-exchange of politics.
1045,(TO JOHN FRASER),But that ideal Parliament
1046,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Did all it said, said all it meant,"
1047,(TO JOHN FRASER),And every Minister of State
1048,(TO JOHN FRASER),Was guileless--as a candidate.
1049,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1050,(TO JOHN FRASER),Statesmen no more the tinker's way
1051,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Mended and patched from day to day,"
1052,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Content with piecing part with part,"
1053,(TO JOHN FRASER),"But took the mighty problem whole,"
1054,(TO JOHN FRASER),Beginning with the human heart:
1055,(TO JOHN FRASER),For noble rulers make in vain
1056,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Unselfish laws for selfish men,"
1057,(TO JOHN FRASER),"And give the whole wide world its vote,"
1058,(TO JOHN FRASER),But who is going to give it soul?
1059,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1060,(TO JOHN FRASER),And then I dreamed had come to reign
1061,(TO JOHN FRASER),True peace within our land again;
1062,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Not peace that rots the soul with ease,"
1063,(TO JOHN FRASER),Or those ignoble 'rivalries
1064,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Of peace' more murderous than war,"
1065,(TO JOHN FRASER),But just the simple peasant peace
1066,(TO JOHN FRASER),The weary world is waiting for.
1067,(TO JOHN FRASER),With simple food and simple wear
1068,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Go lots of love and little care,"
1069,(TO JOHN FRASER),And joy is saved from over-sweet
1070,(TO JOHN FRASER),By struggle not too hard to bear.
1071,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1072,(TO JOHN FRASER),"So dreamed I on from dream to dream,"
1073,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Till, slow returning to my theme,"
1074,(TO JOHN FRASER),Upon my vote I looked again--
1075,(TO JOHN FRASER),To whom was I to give it then?
1076,(TO JOHN FRASER),"That uncorrupted maidenhood,"
1077,(TO JOHN FRASER),My little power for public good.
1078,(TO JOHN FRASER),What party was there that I knew
1079,(TO JOHN FRASER),"That I might dare intrust it to,"
1080,(TO JOHN FRASER),A perfect party fair and square--
1081,(TO JOHN FRASER),My House of Commons in the air?
1082,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1083,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Though called by many different names,"
1084,(TO JOHN FRASER),Each one professed the noblest aims;
1085,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Should all be right, 'twas logical"
1086,(TO JOHN FRASER),That I should give my vote to all!
1087,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1088,(TO JOHN FRASER),"And then, of parties old and new"
1089,(TO JOHN FRASER),"Which one, if only one, were true?"
1090,(TO JOHN FRASER),
1091,(TO JOHN FRASER),"The divination passed my skill,--"
1092,(TO JOHN FRASER),My maiden vote is maiden still.
