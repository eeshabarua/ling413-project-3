52,ENOCH ARDEN.,ENOCH ARDEN.
53,ENOCH ARDEN.,
54,ENOCH ARDEN.,
55,ENOCH ARDEN.,
56,ENOCH ARDEN.,
57,ENOCH ARDEN.,Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;
58,ENOCH ARDEN.,And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;
59,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Beyond, red roofs about a narrow wharf"
60,ENOCH ARDEN.,In cluster; then a moulder'd church; and higher
61,ENOCH ARDEN.,A long street climbs to one tall-tower'd mill;
62,ENOCH ARDEN.,And high in heaven behind it a gray down
63,ENOCH ARDEN.,"With Danish barrows; and a hazelwood,"
64,ENOCH ARDEN.,"By autumn nutters haunted, flourishes"
65,ENOCH ARDEN.,Green in a cuplike hollow of the down.
66,ENOCH ARDEN.,
67,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Here on this beach a hundred years ago,"
68,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Three children of three houses, Annie Lee,"
69,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The prettiest little damsel in the port,"
70,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And Philip Ray the miller's only son,"
71,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And Enoch Arden, a rough sailor's lad"
72,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Made orphan by a winter shipwreck, play'd"
73,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Among the waste and lumber of the shore,"
74,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Hard coils of cordage, swarthy fishing-nets,"
75,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Anchors of rusty fluke, and boats updrawn,"
76,ENOCH ARDEN.,And built their castles of dissolving sand
77,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To watch them overflow'd, or following up"
78,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And flying the white breaker, daily left"
79,ENOCH ARDEN.,The little footprint daily wash'd away.
80,ENOCH ARDEN.,
81,ENOCH ARDEN.,A narrow cave ran in beneath the cliff:
82,ENOCH ARDEN.,In this the children play'd at keeping house.
83,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Enoch was host one day, Philip the next,"
84,ENOCH ARDEN.,While Annie still was mistress; but at times
85,ENOCH ARDEN.,Enoch would hold possession for a week:
86,ENOCH ARDEN.,'This is my house and this my little wife.'
87,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Mine too' said Philip 'turn and turn about:'
88,ENOCH ARDEN.,"When, if they quarrell'd, Enoch stronger-made"
89,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Was master: then would Philip, his blue eyes"
90,ENOCH ARDEN.,"All flooded with the helpless wrath of tears,"
91,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Shriek out 'I hate you, Enoch,' and at this"
92,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The little wife would weep for company,"
93,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And pray them not to quarrel for her sake,"
94,ENOCH ARDEN.,And say she would be little wife to both.
95,ENOCH ARDEN.,
96,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But when the dawn of rosy childhood past,"
97,ENOCH ARDEN.,And the new warmth of life's ascending sun
98,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Was felt by either, either fixt his heart"
99,ENOCH ARDEN.,"On that one girl; and Enoch spoke his love,"
100,ENOCH ARDEN.,But Philip loved in silence; and the girl
101,ENOCH ARDEN.,Seem'd kinder unto Philip than to him;
102,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But she loved Enoch; tho' she knew it not,"
103,ENOCH ARDEN.,And would if ask'd deny it.  Enoch set
104,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A purpose evermore before his eyes,"
105,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To hoard all savings to the uttermost,"
106,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To purchase his own boat, and make a home"
107,ENOCH ARDEN.,For Annie: and so prosper'd that at last
108,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A luckier or a bolder fisherman,"
109,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A carefuller in peril, did not breathe"
110,ENOCH ARDEN.,For leagues along that breaker-beaten coast
111,ENOCH ARDEN.,Than Enoch.  Likewise had he served a year
112,ENOCH ARDEN.,"On board a merchantman, and made himself"
113,ENOCH ARDEN.,Full sailor; and he thrice had pluck'd a life
114,ENOCH ARDEN.,From the dread sweep of the down-streaming seas:
115,ENOCH ARDEN.,And all me look'd upon him favorably:
116,ENOCH ARDEN.,And ere he touch'd his one-and-twentieth May
117,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He purchased his own boat, and made a home"
118,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For Annie, neat and nestlike, halfway up"
119,ENOCH ARDEN.,The narrow street that clamber'd toward the mill.
120,ENOCH ARDEN.,
121,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then, on a golden autumn eventide,"
122,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The younger people making holiday,"
123,ENOCH ARDEN.,"With bag and sack and basket, great and small,"
124,ENOCH ARDEN.,Went nutting to the hazels.  Philip stay'd
125,ENOCH ARDEN.,(His father lying sick and needing him)
126,ENOCH ARDEN.,"An hour behind; but as he climb'd the hill,"
127,ENOCH ARDEN.,Just where the prone edge of the wood began
128,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To feather toward the hollow, saw the pair,"
129,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Enoch and Annie, sitting hand-in-hand,"
130,ENOCH ARDEN.,His large gray eyes and weather-beaten face
131,ENOCH ARDEN.,"All-kindled by a still and sacred fire,"
132,ENOCH ARDEN.,"That burn'd as on an altar.  Philip look'd,"
133,ENOCH ARDEN.,And in their eyes and faces read his doom;
134,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then, as their faces drew together, groan'd,"
135,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And slipt aside, and like a wounded life"
136,ENOCH ARDEN.,Crept down into the hollows of the wood;
137,ENOCH ARDEN.,"There, while the rest were loud in merrymaking,"
138,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Had his dark hour unseen, and rose and past"
139,ENOCH ARDEN.,Bearing a lifelong hunger in his heart.
140,ENOCH ARDEN.,
141,ENOCH ARDEN.,"So these were wed, and merrily rang the bells,"
142,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And merrily ran the years, seven happy years,"
143,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Seven happy years of health and competence,"
144,ENOCH ARDEN.,And mutual love and honorable toil;
145,ENOCH ARDEN.,"With children; first a daughter.  In him woke,"
146,ENOCH ARDEN.,"With his first babe's first cry, the noble wish"
147,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To save all earnings to the uttermost,"
148,ENOCH ARDEN.,And give his child a better bringing-up
149,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Than his had been, or hers; a wish renew'd,"
150,ENOCH ARDEN.,When two years after came a boy to be
151,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The rosy idol of her solitudes,"
152,ENOCH ARDEN.,"While Enoch was abroad on wrathful seas,"
153,ENOCH ARDEN.,Or often journeying landward; for in truth
154,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Enoch's white horse, and Enoch's ocean-spoil"
155,ENOCH ARDEN.,"In ocean-smelling osier, and his face,"
156,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Rough-redden'd with a thousand winter gales,"
157,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Not only to the market-cross were known,"
158,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But in the leafy lanes behind the down,"
159,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Far as the portal-warding lion-whelp,"
160,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And peacock-yewtree of the lonely Hall,"
161,ENOCH ARDEN.,Whose Friday fare was Enoch's ministering.
162,ENOCH ARDEN.,
163,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then came a change, as all things human change."
164,ENOCH ARDEN.,Ten miles to northward of the narrow port
165,ENOCH ARDEN.,Open'd a larger haven: thither used
166,ENOCH ARDEN.,Enoch at times to go by land or sea;
167,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And once when there, and clambering on a mast"
168,ENOCH ARDEN.,"In harbor, by mischance he slipt and fell:"
169,ENOCH ARDEN.,A limb was broken when they lifted him;
170,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And while he lay recovering there, his wife"
171,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Bore him another son, a sickly one:"
172,ENOCH ARDEN.,Another hand crept too across his trade
173,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Taking her bread and theirs: and on him fell,"
174,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Altho' a grave and staid God-fearing man,"
175,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Yet lying thus inactive, doubt and gloom."
176,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He seem'd, as in a nightmare of the night,"
177,ENOCH ARDEN.,To see his children leading evermore
178,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Low miserable lives of hand-to-mouth,"
179,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And her, he loved, a beggar: then he pray'd"
180,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Save them from this, whatever comes to me.'"
181,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And while he pray'd, the master of that ship"
182,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Enoch had served in, hearing his mischance,"
183,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Came, for he knew the man and valued him,"
184,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Reporting of his vessel China-bound,"
185,ENOCH ARDEN.,And wanting yet a boatswain.  Would he go?
186,ENOCH ARDEN.,"There yet were many weeks before she sail'd,"
187,ENOCH ARDEN.,Sail'd from this port.  Would Enoch have the place?
188,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And Enoch all at once assented to it,"
189,ENOCH ARDEN.,Rejoicing at that answer to his prayer.
190,ENOCH ARDEN.,
191,ENOCH ARDEN.,So now that the shadow of mischance appear'd
192,ENOCH ARDEN.,No graver than as when some little cloud
193,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Cuts off the fiery highway of the sun,"
194,ENOCH ARDEN.,And isles a light in the offing: yet the wife--
195,ENOCH ARDEN.,When he was gone--the children--what to do?
196,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then Enoch lay long-pondering on his plans;
197,ENOCH ARDEN.,To sell the boat--and yet he loved her well--
198,ENOCH ARDEN.,How many a rough sea had he weather'd in her!
199,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He knew her, as a horseman knows his horse--"
200,ENOCH ARDEN.,And yet to sell her--then with what she brought
201,ENOCH ARDEN.,Buy goods and stores--set Annie forth in trade
202,ENOCH ARDEN.,With all that seamen needed or their wives--
203,ENOCH ARDEN.,So might she keep the house while he was gone.
204,ENOCH ARDEN.,Should he not trade himself out yonder? go
205,ENOCH ARDEN.,This voyage more than once? yea twice or thrice--
206,ENOCH ARDEN.,"As oft as needed--last, returning rich,"
207,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Become the master of a larger craft,"
208,ENOCH ARDEN.,"With fuller profits lead an easier life,"
209,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Have all his pretty young ones educated,"
210,ENOCH ARDEN.,And pass his days in peace among his own.
211,ENOCH ARDEN.,
212,ENOCH ARDEN.,Thus Enoch in his heart determined all:
213,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then moving homeward came on Annie pale,"
214,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Nursing the sickly babe, her latest-born."
215,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Forward she started with a happy cry,"
216,ENOCH ARDEN.,And laid the feeble infant in his arms;
217,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Whom Enoch took, and handled all his limbs,"
218,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Appraised his weight and fondled fatherlike,"
219,ENOCH ARDEN.,But had no heart to break his purposes
220,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To Annie, till the morrow, when he spoke."
221,ENOCH ARDEN.,
222,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then first since Enoch's golden ring had girt
223,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Her finger, Annie fought against his will:"
224,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Yet not with brawling opposition she,"
225,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But manifold entreaties, many a tear,"
226,ENOCH ARDEN.,Many a sad kiss by day and night renew'd
227,ENOCH ARDEN.,(Sure that all evil would come out of it)
228,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Besought him, supplicating, if he cared"
229,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For here or his dear children, not to go."
230,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He not for his own self caring but her,"
231,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Her and her children, let her plead in vain;"
232,ENOCH ARDEN.,"So grieving held his will, and bore it thro'."
233,ENOCH ARDEN.,
234,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For Enoch parted with his old sea-friend,"
235,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Bought Annie goods and stores, and set his hand"
236,ENOCH ARDEN.,To fit their little streetward sitting-room
237,ENOCH ARDEN.,With shelf and corner for the goods and stores.
238,ENOCH ARDEN.,"So all day long till Enoch's last at home,"
239,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Shaking their pretty cabin, hammer and axe,"
240,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Auger and saw, while Annie seem'd to hear"
241,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Her own death-scaffold raising, shrill'd and rang,"
242,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Till this was ended, and his careful hand,--"
243,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The space was narrow,--having order'd all"
244,ENOCH ARDEN.,Almost as neat and close as Nature packs
245,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Her blossom or her seedling, paused; and he,"
246,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Who needs would work for Annie to the last,"
247,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Ascending tired, heavily slept till morn."
248,ENOCH ARDEN.,
249,ENOCH ARDEN.,And Enoch faced this morning of farewell
250,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Brightly and boldly.  All his Annie's fears,"
251,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Save, as his Annie's, were a laughter to him."
252,ENOCH ARDEN.,Yet Enoch as a brave God-fearing man
253,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Bow'd himself down, and in that mystery"
254,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Where God-in-man is one with man-in-God,"
255,ENOCH ARDEN.,Pray'd for a blessing on his wife and babes
256,ENOCH ARDEN.,Whatever came to him: and then he said
257,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Annie, this voyage by the grace of God"
258,ENOCH ARDEN.,Will bring fair weather yet to all of us.
259,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Keep a clean hearth and a clear fire for me,"
260,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For I'll be back, my girl, before you know it.'"
261,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then lightly rocking baby's cradle 'and he,"
262,ENOCH ARDEN.,"This pretty, puny, weakly little one,--"
263,ENOCH ARDEN.,Nay--for I love him all the better for it--
264,ENOCH ARDEN.,"God bless him, he shall sit upon my knees"
265,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And I will tell him tales of foreign parts,"
266,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And make him merry, when I come home again."
267,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Come Annie, come, cheer up before I go.'"
268,ENOCH ARDEN.,
269,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Him running on thus hopefully she heard,"
270,ENOCH ARDEN.,And almost hoped herself; but when he turn'd
271,ENOCH ARDEN.,The current of his talk to graver things
272,ENOCH ARDEN.,In sailor fashion roughly sermonizing
273,ENOCH ARDEN.,"On providence and trust in Heaven, she heard,"
274,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Heard and not heard him; as the village girl,"
275,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Who sets her pitcher underneath the spring,"
276,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Musing on him that used to fill it for her,"
277,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Hears and not hears, and lets it overflow."
278,ENOCH ARDEN.,
279,ENOCH ARDEN.,"At length she spoke 'O Enoch, you are wise;"
280,ENOCH ARDEN.,And yet for all your wisdom well know I
281,ENOCH ARDEN.,That I shall look upon your face no more.'
282,ENOCH ARDEN.,
283,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Well then,' said Enoch, 'I shall look on yours."
284,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Annie, the ship I sail in passes here"
285,ENOCH ARDEN.,"(He named the day) get you a seaman's glass,"
286,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Spy out my face, and laugh at all your fears.'"
287,ENOCH ARDEN.,
288,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But when the last of those last moments came,"
289,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Annie my girl, cheer up, be comforted,"
290,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Look to the babes, and till I come again,"
291,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Keep everything shipshape, for I must go."
292,ENOCH ARDEN.,And fear no more for me; or if you fear
293,ENOCH ARDEN.,Cast all your cares on God; that anchor holds.
294,ENOCH ARDEN.,Is He not yonder in those uttermost
295,ENOCH ARDEN.,Parts of the morning? if I flee to these
296,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Can I go from Him? and the sea is His,"
297,ENOCH ARDEN.,The sea is His: He made it.'
298,ENOCH ARDEN.,
299,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Enoch rose,"
300,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Cast his strong arms about his drooping wife,"
301,ENOCH ARDEN.,And kiss'd his wonder-stricken little ones;
302,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But for the third, sickly one, who slept"
303,ENOCH ARDEN.,"After a night of feverous wakefulness,"
304,ENOCH ARDEN.,When Annie would have raised him Enoch said
305,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Wake him not; let him sleep; how should this child
306,ENOCH ARDEN.,Remember this?' and kiss'ed him in his cot.
307,ENOCH ARDEN.,But Annie from her baby's forehead clipt
308,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A tiny curl, and gave it: this he kept"
309,ENOCH ARDEN.,Thro' all his future; but now hastily caught
310,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His bundle, waved his hand, and went his way."
311,ENOCH ARDEN.,
312,ENOCH ARDEN.,"She when the day, that Enoch mention'd, came,"
313,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Borrow'd a glass, but all in vain: perhaps"
314,ENOCH ARDEN.,She could not fix the glass to suit her eye;
315,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Perhaps her eye was dim, hand tremulous;"
316,ENOCH ARDEN.,She saw him not: and while he stood on deck
317,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Waving, the moment and the vessel past."
318,ENOCH ARDEN.,
319,ENOCH ARDEN.,Ev'n to the last dip of the vanishing sail
320,ENOCH ARDEN.,"She watch'd it, and departed weeping for him;"
321,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then, tho' she mourn'd his absence as his grave,"
322,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Set her sad will no less to chime with his,"
323,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But throve not in her trade, not being bred"
324,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To barter, nor compensating the want"
325,ENOCH ARDEN.,"By shrewdness, neither capable of lies,"
326,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Nor asking overmuch and taking less,"
327,ENOCH ARDEN.,And still foreboding 'what would Enoch say?'
328,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For more than once, in days of difficulty"
329,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And pressure, had she sold her wares for less"
330,ENOCH ARDEN.,Than what she gave in buying what she sold:
331,ENOCH ARDEN.,"She fail'd and sadden'd knowing it; and thus,"
332,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Expectant of that news that never came,"
333,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Gain'd for here own a scanty sustenance,"
334,ENOCH ARDEN.,And lived a life of silent melancholy.
335,ENOCH ARDEN.,
336,ENOCH ARDEN.,Now the third child was sickly-born and grew
337,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Yet sicklier, tho' the mother cared for it"
338,ENOCH ARDEN.,"With all a mother's care: nevertheless,"
339,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Whether her business often call'd her from it,"
340,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Or thro' the want of what it needed most,"
341,ENOCH ARDEN.,Or means to pay the voice who best could tell
342,ENOCH ARDEN.,"What most it needed--howsoe'er it was,"
343,ENOCH ARDEN.,"After a lingering,--ere she was aware,--"
344,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Like the caged bird escaping suddenly,"
345,ENOCH ARDEN.,The little innocent soul flitted away.
346,ENOCH ARDEN.,
347,ENOCH ARDEN.,"In that same week when Annie buried it,"
348,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Philip's true heart, which hunger'd for her peace"
349,ENOCH ARDEN.,"(Since Enoch left he had not look'd upon her),"
350,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Smote him, as having kept aloof so long."
351,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Surely' said Philip 'I may see her now,"
352,ENOCH ARDEN.,"May be some little comfort;' therefore went,"
353,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Past thro' the solitary room in front,"
354,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Paused for a moment at an inner door,"
355,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then struck it thrice, and, no one opening,"
356,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Enter'd; but Annie, seated with her grief,"
357,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Fresh from the burial of her little one,"
358,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Cared not to look on any human face,"
359,ENOCH ARDEN.,But turn'd her own toward the wall and wept.
360,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then Philip standing up said falteringly
361,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Annie, I came to ask a favor of you.'"
362,ENOCH ARDEN.,
363,ENOCH ARDEN.,He spoke; the passion in her moan'd reply
364,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Favor from one so sad and so forlorn
365,ENOCH ARDEN.,"As I am!' half abash'd him; yet unask'd,"
366,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His bashfulness and tenderness at war,"
367,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He set himself beside her, saying to her:"
368,ENOCH ARDEN.,
369,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'I came to speak to you of what he wish'd,"
370,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Enoch, your husband: I have ever said"
371,ENOCH ARDEN.,You chose the best among us--a strong man:
372,ENOCH ARDEN.,For where he fixt his heart he set his hand
373,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To do the thing he will'd, and bore it thro'."
374,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And wherefore did he go this weary way,"
375,ENOCH ARDEN.,And leave you lonely? not to see the world--
376,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For pleasure?--nay, but for the wherewithal"
377,ENOCH ARDEN.,To give his babes a better bringing-up
378,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Than his had been, or yours: that was his wish."
379,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And if he come again, vext will he be"
380,ENOCH ARDEN.,To find the precious morning hours were lost.
381,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And it would vex him even in his grave,"
382,ENOCH ARDEN.,If he could know his babes were running wild
383,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Like colts about the waste.  So Annie, now--"
384,ENOCH ARDEN.,Have we not known each other all our lives?
385,ENOCH ARDEN.,I do beseech you by the love you bear
386,ENOCH ARDEN.,Him and his children not to say me nay--
387,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For, if you will, when Enoch comes again"
388,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Why then he shall repay me--if you will,"
389,ENOCH ARDEN.,Annie--for I am rich and well-to-do.
390,ENOCH ARDEN.,Now let me put the boy and girl to school:
391,ENOCH ARDEN.,This is the favor that I came to ask.'
392,ENOCH ARDEN.,
393,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then Annie with her brows against the wall
394,ENOCH ARDEN.,Answer'd 'I cannot look you in the face;
395,ENOCH ARDEN.,I seem so foolish and so broken down.
396,ENOCH ARDEN.,When you came in my sorrow broke me down;
397,ENOCH ARDEN.,And now I think your kindness breaks me down;
398,ENOCH ARDEN.,But Enoch lives; that is borne in on me:
399,ENOCH ARDEN.,He will repay you: money can be repaid;
400,ENOCH ARDEN.,Not kindness such as yours.'
401,ENOCH ARDEN.,
402,ENOCH ARDEN.,And Philip ask'd
403,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Then you will let me, Annie?'"
404,ENOCH ARDEN.,
405,ENOCH ARDEN.,"There she turn'd,"
406,ENOCH ARDEN.,"She rose, and fixt her swimming eyes upon him,"
407,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And dwelt a moment on his kindly face,"
408,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then calling down a blessing on his head
409,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Caught at his hand and wrung it passionately,"
410,ENOCH ARDEN.,And past into the little garth beyond.
411,ENOCH ARDEN.,So lifted up in spirit he moved away.
412,ENOCH ARDEN.,
413,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then Philip put the boy and girl to school,"
414,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And bought them needful books, and everyway,"
415,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Like one who does his duty by his own,"
416,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Made himself theirs; and tho' for Annie's sake,"
417,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Fearing the lazy gossip of the port,"
418,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He oft denied his heart his dearest wish,"
419,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And seldom crost her threshold, yet he sent"
420,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Gifts by the children, garden-herbs and fruit,"
421,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The late and early roses from his wall,"
422,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Or conies from the down, and now and then,"
423,ENOCH ARDEN.,With some pretext of fineness in the meal
424,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To save the offence of charitable, flour"
425,ENOCH ARDEN.,From his tall mill that whistled on the waste.
426,ENOCH ARDEN.,
427,ENOCH ARDEN.,But Philip did not fathom Annie's mind:
428,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Scarce could the woman when he came upon her,"
429,ENOCH ARDEN.,Out of full heart and boundless gratitude
430,ENOCH ARDEN.,Light on a broken word to thank him with.
431,ENOCH ARDEN.,But Philip was her children's all-in-all;
432,ENOCH ARDEN.,From distant corners of the street they ran
433,ENOCH ARDEN.,To greet his hearty welcome heartily;
434,ENOCH ARDEN.,Lords of his house and of his mill were they;
435,ENOCH ARDEN.,Worried his passive ear with petty wrongs
436,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Or pleasures, hung upon him, play'd with him"
437,ENOCH ARDEN.,And call'd him Father Philip.  Philip gain'd
438,ENOCH ARDEN.,As Enoch lost; for Enoch seem'd to them
439,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Uncertain as a vision or a dream,"
440,ENOCH ARDEN.,Faint as a figure seen in early dawn
441,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Down at the far end of an avenue,"
442,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Going we know not where: and so ten years,"
443,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Since Enoch left his hearth and native land,"
444,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Fled forward, and no news of Enoch came."
445,ENOCH ARDEN.,
446,ENOCH ARDEN.,It chanced one evening Annie's children long'd
447,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To go with others, nutting to the wood,"
448,ENOCH ARDEN.,And Annie would go with them; then they begg'd
449,ENOCH ARDEN.,For Father Philip (as they call'd him) too:
450,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Him, like the working bee in blossom-dust,"
451,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Blanch'd with his mill, they found; and saying to him"
452,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Come with us Father Philip' he denied;
453,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But when the children pluck'd at him to go,"
454,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He laugh'd, and yielding readily to their wish,"
455,ENOCH ARDEN.,For was not Annie with them? and they went.
456,ENOCH ARDEN.,
457,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But after scaling half the weary down,"
458,ENOCH ARDEN.,Just where the prone edge of the wood began
459,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To feather toward the hollow, all her force"
460,ENOCH ARDEN.,Fail'd her; and sighing 'let me rest' she said.
461,ENOCH ARDEN.,So Philip rested with her well-content;
462,ENOCH ARDEN.,While all the younger ones with jubilant cries
463,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Broke from their elders, and tumultuously"
464,ENOCH ARDEN.,Down thro' the whitening hazels made a plunge
465,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To the bottom, and dispersed, and beat or broke"
466,ENOCH ARDEN.,The lithe reluctant boughs to tear away
467,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Their tawny clusters, crying to each other"
468,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And calling, here and there, about the wood."
469,ENOCH ARDEN.,
470,ENOCH ARDEN.,But Philip sitting at her side forgot
471,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Her presence, and remember'd one dark hour"
472,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Here in this wood, when like a wounded life"
473,ENOCH ARDEN.,He crept into the shadow: at last he said
474,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Lifting his honest forehead 'Listen, Annie,"
475,ENOCH ARDEN.,How merry they are down yonder in the wood.'
476,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Tired, Annie?' for she did not speak a word."
477,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Tired?' but her face had fall'n upon her hands;
478,ENOCH ARDEN.,"At which, as with a kind anger in him,"
479,ENOCH ARDEN.,'The ship was lost' he said 'the ship was lost!
480,ENOCH ARDEN.,No more of that! why should you kill yourself
481,ENOCH ARDEN.,And make them orphans quite?'  And Annie said
482,ENOCH ARDEN.,'I thought not of it: but--I known not why--
483,ENOCH ARDEN.,Their voices make me feel so solitary.'
484,ENOCH ARDEN.,
485,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then Philip coming somewhat closer spoke.
486,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Annie, there is a thing upon my mind,"
487,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And it has been upon my mind so long,"
488,ENOCH ARDEN.,"That tho' I know not when it first came there,"
489,ENOCH ARDEN.,"I know that it will out at last.  O Annie,"
490,ENOCH ARDEN.,"It is beyond all hope, against all chance,"
491,ENOCH ARDEN.,That he who left you ten long years ago
492,ENOCH ARDEN.,Should still be living; well then--let me speak:
493,ENOCH ARDEN.,I grieve to see you poor and wanting help:
494,ENOCH ARDEN.,I cannot help you as I wish to do
495,ENOCH ARDEN.,Unless--they say that women are so quick--
496,ENOCH ARDEN.,Perhaps you know what I would have you know--
497,ENOCH ARDEN.,I wish you for my wife.  I fain would prove
498,ENOCH ARDEN.,A father to your children: I do think
499,ENOCH ARDEN.,They love me as a father: I am sure
500,ENOCH ARDEN.,That I love them as if they were mine own;
501,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And I believe, if you were fast my wife,"
502,ENOCH ARDEN.,"That after all these sad uncertain years,"
503,ENOCH ARDEN.,We might be still as happy as God grants
504,ENOCH ARDEN.,To any of His creatures.  Think upon it:
505,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For I am well-to-do--no kin, no care,"
506,ENOCH ARDEN.,"No burthen, save my care for you and yours:"
507,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And we have known each other all our lives,"
508,ENOCH ARDEN.,And I have loved you longer than you know.'
509,ENOCH ARDEN.,
510,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then answer'd Annie; tenderly she spoke:
511,ENOCH ARDEN.,'You have been as God's good angel in our house.
512,ENOCH ARDEN.,"God bless you for it, God reward you for it,"
513,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Philip, with something happier than myself."
514,ENOCH ARDEN.,Can one live twice? can you be ever loved
515,ENOCH ARDEN.,As Enoch was? what is it that you ask?'
516,ENOCH ARDEN.,'I am content' he answer'd 'to be loved
517,ENOCH ARDEN.,A little after Enoch.'  'O' she cried
518,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Scared as it were 'dear Philip, wait a while:"
519,ENOCH ARDEN.,If Enoch comes--but Enoch will not come--
520,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Yet wait a year, a year is not so long:"
521,ENOCH ARDEN.,Surely I shall be wiser in a year:
522,ENOCH ARDEN.,O wait a little!'  Philip sadly said
523,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Annie, as I have waited all my life"
524,ENOCH ARDEN.,I well may wait a little.'  'Nay' she cried
525,ENOCH ARDEN.,'I am bound: you have my promise--in a year:
526,ENOCH ARDEN.,Will you not bide your year as I bide mine?'
527,ENOCH ARDEN.,And Philip answer'd 'I will bide my year.'
528,ENOCH ARDEN.,
529,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Here both were mute, till Philip glancing up"
530,ENOCH ARDEN.,Beheld the dead flame of the fallen day
531,ENOCH ARDEN.,Pass from the Danish barrow overhead;
532,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then fearing night and chill for Annie rose,"
533,ENOCH ARDEN.,And sent his voice beneath him thro' the wood.
534,ENOCH ARDEN.,Up came the children laden with their spoil;
535,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then all descended to the port, and there"
536,ENOCH ARDEN.,"At Annie's door he paused and gave his hand,"
537,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Saying gently 'Annie, when I spoke to you,"
538,ENOCH ARDEN.,That was your hour of weakness.  I was wrong.
539,ENOCH ARDEN.,"I am always bound to you, but you are free.'"
540,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then Annie weeping answer'd 'I am bound.'
541,ENOCH ARDEN.,
542,ENOCH ARDEN.,"She spoke; and in one moment as it were,"
543,ENOCH ARDEN.,"While yet she went about her household ways,"
544,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Ev'n as she dwelt upon his latest words,"
545,ENOCH ARDEN.,"That he had loved her longer than she knew,"
546,ENOCH ARDEN.,"That autumn into autumn flash'd again,"
547,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And there he stood once more before her face,"
548,ENOCH ARDEN.,Claiming her promise.  'Is it a year?' she ask'd.
549,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Yes, if the nuts' he said 'be ripe again:"
550,ENOCH ARDEN.,Come out and see.'  But she--she put him off--
551,ENOCH ARDEN.,So much to look to--such a change--a month--
552,ENOCH ARDEN.,Give her a month--she knew that she was bound--
553,ENOCH ARDEN.,A month--no more.  Then Philip with his eyes
554,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Full of that lifelong hunger, and his voice"
555,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Shaking a little like a drunkard's hand,"
556,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Take your own time, Annie, take your own time.'"
557,ENOCH ARDEN.,And Annie could have wept for pity of him;
558,ENOCH ARDEN.,And yet she held him on delayingly
559,ENOCH ARDEN.,"With many a scarce-believable excuse,"
560,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Trying his truth and his long-sufferance,"
561,ENOCH ARDEN.,Till half-another year had slipt away.
562,ENOCH ARDEN.,
563,ENOCH ARDEN.,"By this the lazy gossips of the port,"
564,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Abhorrent of a calculation crost,"
565,ENOCH ARDEN.,Began to chafe as at a personal wrong.
566,ENOCH ARDEN.,Some thought that Philip did but trifle with her;
567,ENOCH ARDEN.,Some that she but held off to draw him on;
568,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And others laugh'd at her and Philip too,"
569,ENOCH ARDEN.,As simple folks that knew not their own minds;
570,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And one, in whom all evil fancies clung"
571,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Like serpent eggs together, laughingly"
572,ENOCH ARDEN.,Would hint a worse in either.  Her own son
573,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Was silent, tho' he often look'd his wish;"
574,ENOCH ARDEN.,But evermore the daughter prest upon her
575,ENOCH ARDEN.,To wed the man so dear to all of them
576,ENOCH ARDEN.,And lift the household out of poverty;
577,ENOCH ARDEN.,And Philip's rosy face contracting grew
578,ENOCH ARDEN.,Careworn and wan; and all these things fell on her
579,ENOCH ARDEN.,Sharp as reproach.
580,ENOCH ARDEN.,
581,ENOCH ARDEN.,At last one night it chanced
582,ENOCH ARDEN.,"That Annie could not sleep, but earnestly"
583,ENOCH ARDEN.,Pray'd for a sign 'my Enoch is he gone?'
584,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then compass'd round by the blind wall of night
585,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Brook'd not the expectant terror of her heart,"
586,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Started from bed, and struck herself a light,"
587,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then desperately seized the holy Book,"
588,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Suddenly set it wide to find a sign,"
589,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Suddenly put her finger on the text,"
590,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Under a palmtree.'  That was nothing to her:
591,ENOCH ARDEN.,No meaning there: she closed the book and slept:
592,ENOCH ARDEN.,"When lo! her Enoch sitting on a height,"
593,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Under a palmtree, over him the Sun:"
594,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'He is gone' she thought 'he is happy, he is singing"
595,ENOCH ARDEN.,Hosanna in the highest: yonder shines
596,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The Sun of Righteousness, and these be palms"
597,ENOCH ARDEN.,Whereof the happy people strowing cried
598,ENOCH ARDEN.,"""Hosanna in the highest!""'  Here she woke,"
599,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Resolved, sent for him and said wildly to him"
600,ENOCH ARDEN.,'There is no reason why we should not wed.'
601,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Then for God's sake,' he answer'd, 'both our sakes,"
602,ENOCH ARDEN.,"So you will wed me, let it be at once.'"
603,ENOCH ARDEN.,
604,ENOCH ARDEN.,"So these were wed and merrily rang the bells,"
605,ENOCH ARDEN.,Merrily rang the bells and they were wed.
606,ENOCH ARDEN.,But never merrily beat Annie's heart.
607,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A footstep seem'd to fall beside her path,"
608,ENOCH ARDEN.,"She knew not whence; a whisper in her ear,"
609,ENOCH ARDEN.,She knew not what; nor loved she to be left
610,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Alone at home, nor ventured out alone."
611,ENOCH ARDEN.,"What ail'd her then, that ere she enter'd, often"
612,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Her hand dwelt lingeringly on the latch,"
613,ENOCH ARDEN.,Fearing to enter: Philip thought he knew:
614,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Such doubts and fears were common to her state,"
615,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Being with child: but when her child was born,"
616,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then her new child was as herself renew'd,"
617,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then the new mother came about her heart,"
618,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then her good Philip was her all-in-all,"
619,ENOCH ARDEN.,And that mysterious instinct wholly died.
620,ENOCH ARDEN.,
621,ENOCH ARDEN.,And where was Enoch? prosperously sail'd
622,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The ship 'Good Fortune,' tho' at setting forth"
623,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The Biscay, roughly ridging eastward, shook"
624,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And almost overwhelm'd her, yet unvext"
625,ENOCH ARDEN.,"She slipt across the summer of the world,"
626,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then after a long tumble about the Cape
627,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And frequent interchange of foul and fair,"
628,ENOCH ARDEN.,"She passing thro' the summer world again,"
629,ENOCH ARDEN.,The breath of heaven came continually
630,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And sent her sweetly by the golden isles,"
631,ENOCH ARDEN.,Till silent in her oriental haven.
632,ENOCH ARDEN.,
633,ENOCH ARDEN.,"There Enoch traded for himself, and bought"
634,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Quaint monsters for the market of those times,"
635,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A gilded dragon, also, for the babes."
636,ENOCH ARDEN.,
637,ENOCH ARDEN.,Less lucky her home-voyage: at first indeed
638,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Thro' many a fair sea-circle, day by day,"
639,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Scarce-rocking, her full-busted figure-head"
640,ENOCH ARDEN.,Stared o'er the ripple feathering from her bows:
641,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then follow'd calms, and then winds variable,"
642,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then baffling, a long course of them; and last"
643,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Storm, such as drove her under moonless heavens"
644,ENOCH ARDEN.,Till hard upon the cry of 'breakers' came
645,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The crash of ruin, and the loss of all"
646,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But Enoch and two others.  Half the night,"
647,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Buoy'd upon floating tackle and broken spars,"
648,ENOCH ARDEN.,"These drifted, stranding on an isle at morn"
649,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Rich, but loneliest in a lonely sea."
650,ENOCH ARDEN.,
651,ENOCH ARDEN.,"No want was there of human sustenance,"
652,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Soft fruitage, mighty nuts, and nourishing roots;"
653,ENOCH ARDEN.,Nor save for pity was it hard to take
654,ENOCH ARDEN.,The helpless life so wild that it was tame.
655,ENOCH ARDEN.,There in a seaward-gazing mountain-gorge
656,ENOCH ARDEN.,"They built, and thatch'd with leaves of palm, a hut,"
657,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Half hut, half native cavern.  So the three,"
658,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Set in this Eden of all plenteousness,"
659,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Dwelt with eternal summer, ill-content."
660,ENOCH ARDEN.,
661,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For one, the youngest, hardly more than boy,"
662,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Hurt in that night of sudden ruin and wreck,"
663,ENOCH ARDEN.,Lay lingering out a three-years' death-in-life.
664,ENOCH ARDEN.,"They could not leave him.  After he was gone,"
665,ENOCH ARDEN.,The two remaining found a fallen stem;
666,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And Enoch's comrade, careless of himself,"
667,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Fire-hollowing this in Indian fashion, fell"
668,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Sun-stricken, and that other lived alone."
669,ENOCH ARDEN.,In those two deaths he read God's warning 'wait.'
670,ENOCH ARDEN.,
671,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The mountain wooded to the peak, the lawns"
672,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And winding glades high up like ways to Heaven,"
673,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The slender coco's drooping crown of plumes,"
674,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The lightning flash of insect and of bird,"
675,ENOCH ARDEN.,The lustre of the long convolvuluses
676,ENOCH ARDEN.,"That coil'd around the stately stems, and ran"
677,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Ev'n to the limit of the land, the glows"
678,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And glories of the broad belt of the world,"
679,ENOCH ARDEN.,All these he saw; but what he fain had seen
680,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He could not see, the kindly human face,"
681,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard"
682,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,"
683,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The league-long roller thundering on the reef,"
684,ENOCH ARDEN.,The moving whisper of huge trees that branch'd
685,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And blossom'd in the zenith, or the sweep"
686,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,"
687,ENOCH ARDEN.,"As down the shore he ranged, or all day long"
688,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,"
689,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A shipwreck'd sailor, waiting for a sail:"
690,ENOCH ARDEN.,"No sail from day to day, but every day"
691,ENOCH ARDEN.,The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts
692,ENOCH ARDEN.,Among the palms and ferns and precipices;
693,ENOCH ARDEN.,The blaze upon the waters to the east;
694,ENOCH ARDEN.,The blaze upon his island overhead;
695,ENOCH ARDEN.,The blaze upon the waters to the west;
696,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven,"
697,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again"
698,ENOCH ARDEN.,The scarlet shafts of sunrise--but no sail.
699,ENOCH ARDEN.,
700,ENOCH ARDEN.,"There often as he watch'd or seem'd to watch,"
701,ENOCH ARDEN.,"So still, the golden lizard on him paused,"
702,ENOCH ARDEN.,A phantom made of many phantoms moved
703,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Before him haunting him, or he himself"
704,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Moved haunting people, things and places, known"
705,ENOCH ARDEN.,Far in a darker isle beyond the line;
706,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The babes, their babble, Annie, the small house,"
707,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The climbing street, the mill, the leafy lanes,"
708,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The peacock-yewtree and the lonely Hall,"
709,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The horse he drove, the boat he sold, the chill"
710,ENOCH ARDEN.,"November dawns and dewy-glooming downs,"
711,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The gentle shower, the smell of dying leaves,"
712,ENOCH ARDEN.,And the low moan of leaden-color'd seas.
713,ENOCH ARDEN.,
714,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Once likewise, in the ringing of his ears,"
715,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Tho' faintly, merrily--far and far away--"
716,ENOCH ARDEN.,He heard the pealing of his parish bells;
717,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then, tho' he knew not wherefore, started up"
718,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Shuddering, and when the beauteous hateful isle"
719,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Return'd upon him, had not his poor heart"
720,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Spoken with That, which being everywhere"
721,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Lets none, who speaks with Him, seem all alone,"
722,ENOCH ARDEN.,Surely the man had died of solitude.
723,ENOCH ARDEN.,
724,ENOCH ARDEN.,Thus over Enoch's early-silvering head
725,ENOCH ARDEN.,The sunny and rainy seasons came and went
726,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Year after year.  His hopes to see his own,"
727,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And pace the sacred old familiar fields,"
728,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Not yet had perish'd, when his lonely doom"
729,ENOCH ARDEN.,Came suddenly to an end.  Another ship
730,ENOCH ARDEN.,"(She wanted water) blown by baffling winds,"
731,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Like the Good Fortune, from her destined course,"
732,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Stay'd by this isle, not knowing where she lay:"
733,ENOCH ARDEN.,For since the mate had seen at early dawn
734,ENOCH ARDEN.,Across a break on the mist-wreathen isle
735,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The silent water slipping from the hills,"
736,ENOCH ARDEN.,They sent a crew that landing burst away
737,ENOCH ARDEN.,"In search of stream or fount, and fill'd the shores"
738,ENOCH ARDEN.,With clamor.  Downward from his mountain gorge
739,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Stept the long-hair'd long-bearded solitary,"
740,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Brown, looking hardly human, strangely clad,"
741,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Muttering and mumbling, idiotlike it seem'd,"
742,ENOCH ARDEN.,"With inarticulate rage, and making signs"
743,ENOCH ARDEN.,They knew not what: and yet he led the way
744,ENOCH ARDEN.,To where the rivulets of sweet water ran;
745,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And ever as he mingled with the crew,"
746,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And heard them talking, his long-bounden tongue"
747,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Was loosen'd, till he made them understand;"
748,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Whom, when their casks were fill'd they took aboard:"
749,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And there the tale he utter'd brokenly,"
750,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Scarce credited at first but more and more,"
751,ENOCH ARDEN.,Amazed and melted all who listen'd to it:
752,ENOCH ARDEN.,And clothes they gave him and free passage home;
753,ENOCH ARDEN.,But oft he work'd among the rest and shook
754,ENOCH ARDEN.,His isolation from him.  None of these
755,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Came from his county, or could answer him,"
756,ENOCH ARDEN.,"If question'd, aught of what he cared to know."
757,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And dull the voyage was with long delays,"
758,ENOCH ARDEN.,The vessel scarce sea-worthy; but evermore
759,ENOCH ARDEN.,His fancy fled before the lazy wind
760,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Returning, till beneath a clouded moon"
761,ENOCH ARDEN.,He like a lover down thro' all his blood
762,ENOCH ARDEN.,Drew in the dewy meadowy morning-breath
763,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Of England, blown across her ghostly wall:"
764,ENOCH ARDEN.,And that same morning officers and men
765,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Levied a kindly tax upon themselves,"
766,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Pitying the lonely man, and gave him it:"
767,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then moving up the coast they landed him,"
768,ENOCH ARDEN.,Ev'n in that harbor whence he sail'd before.
769,ENOCH ARDEN.,
770,ENOCH ARDEN.,"There Enoch spoke no word to anyone,"
771,ENOCH ARDEN.,But homeward--home--what home? had he a home?
772,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His home, he walk'd.  Bright was that afternoon,"
773,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Sunny but chill; till drawn thro' either chasm,"
774,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Where either haven open'd on the deeps,"
775,ENOCH ARDEN.,Roll'd a sea-haze and whelm'd the world in gray;
776,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Cut off the length of highway on before,"
777,ENOCH ARDEN.,And left but narrow breadth to left and right
778,ENOCH ARDEN.,Of wither'd holt or tilth or pasturage.
779,ENOCH ARDEN.,On the nigh-naked tree the Robin piped
780,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Disconsolate, and thro' the dripping haze"
781,ENOCH ARDEN.,The dead weight of the dead leaf bore it down.
782,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Thicker the drizzle grew, deeper the gloom;"
783,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Last, as it seem'd, a great mist-blotted light"
784,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Flared on him, and he came upon the place."
785,ENOCH ARDEN.,
786,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then down the long street having slowly stolen,"
787,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His heart foreshadowing all calamity,"
788,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His eyes upon the stones, he reach'd the home"
789,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Where Annie lived and loved him, and his babes"
790,ENOCH ARDEN.,In those far-off seven happy years were born;
791,ENOCH ARDEN.,But finding neither light nor murmur there
792,ENOCH ARDEN.,(A bill of sale gleam'd thro' the drizzle) crept
793,ENOCH ARDEN.,Still downward thinking 'dead or dead to me!'
794,ENOCH ARDEN.,
795,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Down to the pool and narrow wharf he went,"
796,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Seeking a tavern which of old he knew,"
797,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A front of timber-crost antiquity,"
798,ENOCH ARDEN.,"So propt, worm-eaten, ruinously old,"
799,ENOCH ARDEN.,He thought it must have gone; but he was gone
800,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Who kept it; and his widow, Miriam Lane,"
801,ENOCH ARDEN.,With daily-dwindling profits held the house;
802,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A haunt of brawling seamen once, but now"
803,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Stiller, with yet a bed for wandering men."
804,ENOCH ARDEN.,There Enoch rested silently many days.
805,ENOCH ARDEN.,
806,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But Miriam Lane was good and garrulous,"
807,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Nor let him be, but often breaking in,"
808,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Told him, with other annals of the port,"
809,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Not knowing--Enoch was so brown, so bow'd,"
810,ENOCH ARDEN.,So broken--all the story of his house.
811,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His baby's death, her growing poverty,"
812,ENOCH ARDEN.,"How Philip put her little ones to school,"
813,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And kept them in it, his long wooing her,"
814,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Her slow consent, and marriage, and the birth"
815,ENOCH ARDEN.,Of Philip's child: and o'er his countenance
816,ENOCH ARDEN.,"No shadow past, nor motion: anyone,"
817,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Regarding, well had deem'd he felt the tale"
818,ENOCH ARDEN.,Less than the teller: only when she closed
819,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Enoch, poor man, was cast away and lost'"
820,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He, shaking his gray head pathetically,"
821,ENOCH ARDEN.,Repeated muttering 'cast away and lost;'
822,ENOCH ARDEN.,Again in deeper inward whispers 'lost!'
823,ENOCH ARDEN.,
824,ENOCH ARDEN.,But Enoch yearn'd to see her face again;
825,ENOCH ARDEN.,'If I might look on her sweet face gain
826,ENOCH ARDEN.,And know that she is happy.'  So the thought
827,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Haunted and harass'd him, and drove him forth,"
828,ENOCH ARDEN.,At evening when the dull November day
829,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Was growing duller twilight, to the hill."
830,ENOCH ARDEN.,There he sat down gazing on all below;
831,ENOCH ARDEN.,"There did a thousand memories roll upon him,"
832,ENOCH ARDEN.,Unspeakable for sadness.  By and by
833,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The ruddy square of comfortable light,"
834,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Far-blazing from the rear of Philip's house,"
835,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Allured him, as the beacon-blaze allures"
836,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The bird of passage, till he madly strikes"
837,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Against it, and beats out his weary life."
838,ENOCH ARDEN.,
839,ENOCH ARDEN.,"For Philip's dwelling fronted on the street,"
840,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The latest house to landward; but behind,"
841,ENOCH ARDEN.,"With one small gate that open'd on the waste,"
842,ENOCH ARDEN.,Flourish'd a little garden square and wall'd:
843,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And in it throve an ancient evergreen,"
844,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A yewtree, and all round it ran a walk"
845,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Of shingle, and a walk divided it:"
846,ENOCH ARDEN.,But Enoch shunn'd the middle walk and stole
847,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Up by the wall, behind the yew; and thence"
848,ENOCH ARDEN.,"That which he better might have shunn'd, if griefs"
849,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Like his have worse or better, Enoch saw."
850,ENOCH ARDEN.,
851,ENOCH ARDEN.,For cups and silver on the burnish'd board
852,ENOCH ARDEN.,Sparkled and shone; so genial was the hearth:
853,ENOCH ARDEN.,And on the right hand of the hearth he saw
854,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Philip, the slighted suitor of old times,"
855,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Stout, rosy, with his babe across his knees;"
856,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And o'er her second father stoopt a girl,"
857,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A later but a loftier Annie Lee,"
858,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Fair-hair'd and tall, and from her lifted hand"
859,ENOCH ARDEN.,Dangled a length of ribbon and a ring
860,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To tempt the babe, who rear'd his creasy arms,"
861,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Caught at and ever miss'd it, and they laugh'd:"
862,ENOCH ARDEN.,And on the left hand of the hearth he saw
863,ENOCH ARDEN.,"The mother glancing often toward her babe,"
864,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But turning now and then to speak with him,"
865,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Her son, who stood beside her tall and strong,"
866,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And saying that which pleased him, for he smiled."
867,ENOCH ARDEN.,
868,ENOCH ARDEN.,Now when the dead man come to life beheld
869,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His wife his wife no more, and saw the babe"
870,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Hers, yet not his, upon the father's knee,"
871,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And all the warmth, the peace, the happiness,"
872,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And his own children tall and beautiful,"
873,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And him, that other, reigning in his place,"
874,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Lord of his rights and of his children's love,--"
875,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then he, tho' Miriam Lane had told him all,"
876,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Because things seen are mightier than things heard,"
877,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Stagger'd and shook, holding the branch, and fear'd"
878,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To send abroad a shrill and terrible cry,"
879,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Which in one moment, like the blast of doom,"
880,ENOCH ARDEN.,Would shatter all the happiness of the hearth.
881,ENOCH ARDEN.,
882,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He therefore turning softly like a thief,"
883,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Lest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot,"
884,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And feeling all along the garden-wall,"
885,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Lest he should swoon and tumble and be found,"
886,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Crept to the gate, and open'd it, and closed,"
887,ENOCH ARDEN.,"As lightly as a sick man's chamber-door,"
888,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Behind him, and came out upon the waste."
889,ENOCH ARDEN.,
890,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And there he would have knelt, but that his knees"
891,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Were feeble, so that falling prone he dug"
892,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His fingers into the wet earth, and pray'd."
893,ENOCH ARDEN.,
894,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Too hard to bear! why did they take me hence?
895,ENOCH ARDEN.,"O God Almighty, blessed Saviour, Thou"
896,ENOCH ARDEN.,"That didst uphold me on my lonely isle,"
897,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Uphold me, Father, in my loneliness"
898,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A little longer! aid me, give me strength"
899,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Not to tell her, never to let her know."
900,ENOCH ARDEN.,Help me no to break in upon her peace.
901,ENOCH ARDEN.,My children too! must I not speak to these?
902,ENOCH ARDEN.,They know me not.  I should betray myself.
903,ENOCH ARDEN.,Never: not father's kiss for me--the girl
904,ENOCH ARDEN.,"So like her mother, and the boy, my son.'"
905,ENOCH ARDEN.,
906,ENOCH ARDEN.,"There speech and thought and nature fail'd a little,"
907,ENOCH ARDEN.,And he lay tranced; but when he rose and paced
908,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Back toward his solitary home again,"
909,ENOCH ARDEN.,All down the long and narrow street he went
910,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Beating it in upon his weary brain,"
911,ENOCH ARDEN.,"As tho' it were the burthen of a song,"
912,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Not to tell her, never to let her know.'"
913,ENOCH ARDEN.,
914,ENOCH ARDEN.,He was not all unhappy.  His resolve
915,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Upbore him, and firm faith, and evermore"
916,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Prayer from a living source within the will,"
917,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And beating up thro' all the bitter world,"
918,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Like fountains of sweet water in the sea,"
919,ENOCH ARDEN.,Kept him a living soul.  'This miller's wife'
920,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He said to Miriam 'that you told me of,"
921,ENOCH ARDEN.,Has she no fear that her first husband lives?'
922,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Ay ay, poor soul' said Miriam, 'fear enow!"
923,ENOCH ARDEN.,"If you could tell her you had seen him dead,"
924,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Why, that would be her comfort;' and he thought"
925,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'After the Lord has call'd me she shall know,"
926,ENOCH ARDEN.,"I wait His time' and Enoch set himself,"
927,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Scorning an alms, to work whereby to live."
928,ENOCH ARDEN.,Almost to all things could he turn his hand.
929,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Cooper he was and carpenter, and wrought"
930,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To make the boatmen fishing-nets, or help'd"
931,ENOCH ARDEN.,"At lading and unlading the tall barks,"
932,ENOCH ARDEN.,That brought the stinted commerce of those days;
933,ENOCH ARDEN.,Thus earn'd a scanty living for himself:
934,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Yet since he did but labor for himself,"
935,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Work without hope, there was not life in it"
936,ENOCH ARDEN.,Whereby the man could live; and as the year
937,ENOCH ARDEN.,Roll'd itself round again to meet the day
938,ENOCH ARDEN.,"When Enoch had return'd, a languor came"
939,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Upon him, gentle sickness, gradually"
940,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Weakening the man, till he could do no more,"
941,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But kept the house, his chair, and last his bed."
942,ENOCH ARDEN.,And Enoch bore his weakness cheerfully.
943,ENOCH ARDEN.,For sure no gladlier does the stranded wreck
944,ENOCH ARDEN.,See thro' the gray skirts of a lifting squall
945,ENOCH ARDEN.,The boat that bears the hope of life approach
946,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To save the life despair'd of, than he saw"
947,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Death dawning on him, and the close of all."
948,ENOCH ARDEN.,
949,ENOCH ARDEN.,For thro' that dawning gleam'd a kindlier hope
950,ENOCH ARDEN.,"On Enoch thinking 'after I am gone,"
951,ENOCH ARDEN.,Then may she learn I loved her to the last.'
952,ENOCH ARDEN.,He call'd aloud for Miriam Lane and said
953,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Woman, I have a secret--only swear,"
954,ENOCH ARDEN.,Before I tell you--swear upon the book
955,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Not to reveal it, till you see me dead.'"
956,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Dead' clamor'd the good woman 'hear him talk!
957,ENOCH ARDEN.,"I warrant, man, that we shall bring you round.'"
958,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Swear' add Enoch sternly 'on the book.'
959,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And on the book, half-frighted, Miriam swore."
960,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then Enoch rolling his gray eyes upon her,"
961,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Did you know Enoch Arden of this town?'
962,ENOCH ARDEN.,'Know him?' she said 'I knew him far away.
963,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Ay, ay, I mind him coming down the street;"
964,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Held his head high, and cared for no man, he.'"
965,ENOCH ARDEN.,Slowly and sadly Enoch answer'd her;
966,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'His head is low, and no man cares for him."
967,ENOCH ARDEN.,I think I have not three days more to live;
968,ENOCH ARDEN.,I am the man.'  At which the woman gave
969,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A half-incredulous, half-hysterical cry."
970,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'You Arden, you! nay,--sure he was a foot"
971,ENOCH ARDEN.,Higher than you be.'  Enoch said again
972,ENOCH ARDEN.,'My God has bow'd me down to what I am;
973,ENOCH ARDEN.,My grief and solitude have broken me;
974,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Nevertheless, know that I am he"
975,ENOCH ARDEN.,Who married--but that name has twice been changed--
976,ENOCH ARDEN.,I married her who married Philip Ray.
977,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Sit, listen.'  Then he told her of his voyage,"
978,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His wreck, his lonely life, his coming back,"
979,ENOCH ARDEN.,"His gazing in on Annie, his resolve,"
980,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And how he kept it.  As the woman heard,"
981,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Fast flow'd the current of her easy tears,"
982,ENOCH ARDEN.,While in her heart she yearn'd incessantly
983,ENOCH ARDEN.,"To rush abroad all round the little haven,"
984,ENOCH ARDEN.,Proclaiming Enoch Arden and his woes;
985,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But awed and promise-bounded she forbore,"
986,ENOCH ARDEN.,Saying only 'See your bairns before you go!
987,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Eh, let me fetch 'em, Arden,' and arose"
988,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Eager to bring them down, for Enoch hung"
989,ENOCH ARDEN.,"A moment on her words, but then replied."
990,ENOCH ARDEN.,
991,ENOCH ARDEN.,"'Woman, disturb me not now at the last,"
992,ENOCH ARDEN.,But let me hold my purpose till I die.
993,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Sit down again; mark me and understand,"
994,ENOCH ARDEN.,"While I have power to speak.  I charge you now,"
995,ENOCH ARDEN.,"When you shall see her, tell her that I died"
996,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Blessing her, praying for her, loving her;"
997,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Save for the bar between us, loving her"
998,ENOCH ARDEN.,As when she laid her head beside my own.
999,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And tell my daughter Annie, whom I saw"
1000,ENOCH ARDEN.,"So like her mother, that my latest breath"
1001,ENOCH ARDEN.,Was spent in blessing her and praying for her.
1002,ENOCH ARDEN.,And tell my son that I died blessing him.
1003,ENOCH ARDEN.,And say to Philip that I blest him too;
1004,ENOCH ARDEN.,He never meant us any thing but good.
1005,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But if my children care to see me dead,"
1006,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Who hardly saw me living, let them come,"
1007,ENOCH ARDEN.,"I am their father; but she must not come,"
1008,ENOCH ARDEN.,For my dead face would vex her after-life.
1009,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And now there is but one of all my blood,"
1010,ENOCH ARDEN.,Who will embrace me in the world-to-be:
1011,ENOCH ARDEN.,"This hair is his: she cut it off and gave it,"
1012,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And I have borne it with me all these years,"
1013,ENOCH ARDEN.,And thought to bear it with me to my grave;
1014,ENOCH ARDEN.,"But now my mind is changed, for I shall see him,"
1015,ENOCH ARDEN.,"My babe in bliss: wherefore when I am gone,"
1016,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Take, give her this, for it may comfort her:"
1017,ENOCH ARDEN.,"It will moreover be a token to her,"
1018,ENOCH ARDEN.,That I am he.'
1019,ENOCH ARDEN.,
1020,ENOCH ARDEN.,He ceased; and Miriam Lane
1021,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Made such a voluble answer promising all,"
1022,ENOCH ARDEN.,That once again he roll'd his eyes upon her
1023,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Repeating all he wish'd, and once again"
1024,ENOCH ARDEN.,She promised.
1025,ENOCH ARDEN.,
1026,ENOCH ARDEN.,"Then the third night after this,"
1027,ENOCH ARDEN.,"While Enoch slumber'd motionless and pale,"
1028,ENOCH ARDEN.,"And Miriam watch'd and dozed at intervals,"
1029,ENOCH ARDEN.,"There came so loud a calling of the sea,"
1030,ENOCH ARDEN.,That all the houses in the haven rang.
1031,ENOCH ARDEN.,"He woke, he rose, he spread his arms abroad"
1032,ENOCH ARDEN.,Crying with a loud voice 'a sail! a sail!
1033,ENOCH ARDEN.,I am saved'; and so fell back and spoke no more.
1034,ENOCH ARDEN.,
1035,ENOCH ARDEN.,So past the strong heroic soul away.
1036,ENOCH ARDEN.,And when they buried him the little port
1037,ENOCH ARDEN.,Had seldom seen a costlier funeral.

1059,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Which at a touch of light, an air of heaven,"
1060,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Slipt into ashes and was found no more.
1061,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1062,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Here is a story which in rougher shape
1063,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Came from a grizzled cripple, whom I saw"
1064,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Sunning himself in a waste field alone--
1065,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Old, and a mine of memories--who had served,"
1066,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Long since, a bygone Rector of the place,"
1067,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And been himself a part of what he told.
1068,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1069,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sir Aylmer Aylmer that almighty man,"
1070,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The county God--in whose capacious hall,"
1071,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Hung with a hundred shields, the family tree"

1073,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Whose blazing wyvern weathercock'd the spire,"
1074,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Stood from his walls and wing'd his entry-gates
1075,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And swang besides on many a windy sign--
1076,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Whose eyes from under a pyramidal head
1077,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Saw from his windows nothing save his own--
1078,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"What lovelier of his own had he than her,"
1079,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His only child, his Edith, whom he loved"
1080,AYLMER'S FIELD.,As heiress and not heir regretfully?
1081,AYLMER'S FIELD.,But 'he that marries her marries her name'
1082,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"This fiat somewhat soothed himself and wife,"
1083,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His wife a faded beauty of the Baths,"
1084,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Insipid as the Queen upon a card;
1085,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Her all of thought and bearing hardly more
1086,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Than his own shadow in a sickly sun.
1087,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1088,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A land of hops and poppy-mingled corn,"
1089,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Little about it stirring save a brook!
1090,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A sleepy land where under the same wheel
1091,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The same old rut would deepen year by year;
1092,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Where almost all the village had one name;
1093,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Where Aylmer follow'd Aylmer at the Hall
1094,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And Averill Averill at the Rectory
1095,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thrice over; so that Rectory and Hall,"
1096,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Bound in an immemorial intimacy,"
1097,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Were open to each other; tho' to dream
1098,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That Love could bind them closer well had made
1099,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The hoar hair of the Baronet bristle up
1100,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"With horror, worse than had he heard his priest"
1101,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Preach an inverted scripture, sons of men"
1102,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Daughters of God; so sleepy was the land.
1103,AYLMER'S FIELD.,

1106,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Have also set his many-shielded tree?
1107,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"There was an Aylmer-Averill marriage once,"
1108,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"When the red rose was redder than itself,"
1109,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And York's white rose as red as Lancaster's,"

1118,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"By one low voice to one dear neighborhood,"
1119,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Would often, in his walks with Edith, claim"
1120,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A distant kinship to the gracious blood
1121,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That shook the heart of Edith hearing him.
1122,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1123,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Sanguine he was: a but less vivid hue
1124,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Than of that islet in the chestnut-bloom
1125,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Flamed his cheek; and eager eyes, that still"
1126,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Took joyful note of all things joyful, beam'd,"
1127,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Beneath a manelike mass of rolling gold,"
1128,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Their best and brightest, when they dwelt on hers."
1129,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Edith, whose pensive beauty, perfect else,"
1130,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"But subject to the season or the mood,"
1131,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Shone like a mystic star between the less
1132,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And greater glory varying to and fro,"
1133,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"We know not wherefore; bounteously made,"
1134,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And yet so finely, that a troublous touch"
1135,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thinn'd, or would seem to thin her in a day,"
1136,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A joyous to dilate, as toward the light."
1137,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And these had been together from the first.

1145,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Against the rush of the air in the prone swing,"
1146,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Made blossom-ball or daisy-chain, arranged"
1147,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Her garden, sow'd her name and kept it green"
1148,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"In living letters, told her fairy-tales,"
1149,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Show'd here the fairy footings on the grass,"
1150,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The little dells of cowslip, fairy palms,"
1151,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The petty marestail forest, fairy pines,"
1152,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Or from the tiny pitted target blew
1153,AYLMER'S FIELD.,What look'd a flight of fairy arrows aim'd
1154,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"All at one mark, all hitting: make-believes"
1155,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"For Edith and himself: or else he forged,"
1156,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"But that was later, boyish histories"
1157,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Of battle, bold adventure, dungeon, wreck,"
1158,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Flights, terrors, sudden rescues, and true love"
1159,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Crown'd after trial; sketches rude and faint,"
1160,AYLMER'S FIELD.,But where a passion yet unborn perhaps
1161,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Lay hidden as the music of the moon
1162,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Sleeps in the plain eggs of the nightingale.
1163,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And thus together, save for college-times"
1164,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Or Temple-eaten terms, a couple, fair"
1165,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"As ever painter painted, poet sang,"
1166,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Or Heav'n in lavish bounty moulded, grew."
1167,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And more and more, the maiden woman-grown,"
1168,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He wasted hours with Averill; there, when first"
1169,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The tented winter-field was broken up
1170,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Into that phalanx of the summer spears
1171,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That soon should wear the garland; there again
1172,AYLMER'S FIELD.,When burr and bine were gather'd; lastly there
1173,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"At Christmas; ever welcome at the Hall,"
1174,AYLMER'S FIELD.,On whose dull sameness his full tide of youth
1175,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Broke with a phosphorescence cheering even
1176,AYLMER'S FIELD.,My lady; and the Baronet yet had laid
1177,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"No bar between them: dull and self-involved,"
1178,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Tall and erect, but bending from his height"
1179,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"With half-allowing smiles for all the world,"
1180,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And mighty courteous in the main--his pride
1181,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Lay deeper than to wear it as his ring--
1182,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He, like an Aylmer in his Aylmerism,"
1183,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Would care no more for Leolin's walking with her
1184,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Than for his old Newfoundland's, when they ran"
1185,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"To loose him at the stables, for he rose"
1186,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Twofooted at the limit of his chain,"
1187,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Roaring to make a third: and how should Love,"
1188,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Whom the cross-lightnings of four chance-met eyes
1189,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Flash into fiery life from nothing, follow"
1190,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Such dear familiarities of dawn?
1191,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Seldom, but when he does, Master of all."
1192,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1193,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"So these young hearts not knowing that they loved,"
1194,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Not she at least, nor conscious of a bar"
1195,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Between them, nor by plight or broken ring"
1196,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Bound, but an immemorial intimacy,"
1197,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Wander'd at will, but oft accompanied"
1198,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"By Averill: his, a brother's love, that hung"
1199,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"With wings of brooding shelter o'er her peace,"
1200,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Might have been other, save for Leolin's--"
1201,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Who knows? but so they wander'd, hour by hour"
1202,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Gather'd the blossom that rebloom'd, and drank"
1203,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The magic cup that fill'd itself anew.
1204,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1205,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A whisper half reveal'd her to herself.
1206,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"For out beyond her lodges, where the brook"
1207,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Vocal, with here and there a silence, ran"
1208,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"By sallowy rims, arose the laborers' homes,"
1209,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A frequent haunt of Edith, on low knolls"
1210,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That dimpling died into each other, huts"
1211,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"At random scatter'd, each a nest in bloom."
1212,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Her art, her hand, her counsel all had wrought"
1213,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"About them: here was one that, summer-blanch'd,"
1214,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Was parcel-bearded with the traveller's-joy
1215,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"In Autumn, parcel ivy-clad; and here"
1216,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The warm-blue breathings of a hidden hearth
1217,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Broke from a bower of vine and honeysuckle:
1218,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"One look'd all rosetree, and another wore"
1219,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A close-set robe of jasmine sown with stars:
1220,AYLMER'S FIELD.,This had a rosy sea of gillyflowers
1221,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"About it; this, a milky-way on earth,"
1222,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Like visions in the Northern dreamer's heavens,"
1223,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A lily-avenue climbing to the doors;
1224,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"One, almost to the martin-haunted eaves"
1225,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A summer burial deep in hollyhocks;
1226,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Each, its own charm; and Edith's everywhere;"
1227,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And Edith ever visitant with him,"
1228,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He but less loved than Edith, of her poor:"
1229,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"For she--so lowly-lovely and so loving,"
1230,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Queenly responsive when the loyal hand
1231,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Rose from the clay it work'd in as she past,"
1232,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Not sowing hedgerow texts and passing by,"
1233,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Nor dealing goodly counsel from a height
1234,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That makes the lowest hate it, but a voice"
1235,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Of comfort and an open hand of help,"
1236,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A splendid presence flattering the poor roofs
1237,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Revered as theirs, but kindlier than themselves"
1238,AYLMER'S FIELD.,To ailing wife or wailing infancy
1239,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Or old bedridden palsy,--was adored;"
1240,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He, loved for her and for himself.  A grasp"
1241,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Having the warmth and muscle of the heart,"
1242,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A childly way with children, and a laugh"
1243,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Ringing like proved golden coinage true,"
1244,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Were no false passport to that easy realm,"
1245,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Where once with Leolin at her side the girl,"
1246,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Nursing a child, and turning to the warmth"
1247,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The tender pink five-beaded baby-soles,"
1248,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Heard the good mother softly whisper 'Bless,"
1249,AYLMER'S FIELD.,God bless 'em; marriages are made in Heaven.'
1250,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1251,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A flash of semi-jealousy clear'd it to her.
1252,AYLMER'S FIELD.,My Lady's Indian kinsman unannounced
1253,AYLMER'S FIELD.,With half a score of swarthy faces came.
1254,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His own, tho' keen and bold and soldierly,"
1255,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sear'd by the close ecliptic, was not fair;"
1256,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Fairer his talk, a tongue that ruled the hour,"
1257,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Tho' seeming boastful: so when first he dash'd
1258,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Into the chronicle of a deedful day,"
1259,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Sir Aylmer half forgot his lazy smile
1260,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Of patron 'Good! my lady's kinsman! good!'
1261,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"My lady with her fingers interlock'd,"
1262,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And rotatory thumbs on silken knees,"
1263,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Call'd all her vital spirits into each ear
1264,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"To listen: unawares they flitted off,"
1265,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Busying themselves about the flowerage
1266,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That stood from our a stiff brocade in which,"
1267,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The meteor of a splendid season, she,"
1268,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Once with this kinsman, ah so long ago,"
1269,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Stept thro' the stately minuet of those days:
1270,AYLMER'S FIELD.,But Edith's eager fancy hurried with him
1271,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Snatch'd thro' the perilous passes of his life:
1272,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Till Leolin ever watchful of her eye
1273,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Hated him with a momentary hate.
1274,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Wife-hunting, as the rumor ran, was he:"
1275,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"I know not, for he spoke not, only shower'd"
1276,AYLMER'S FIELD.,His oriental gifts on everyone
1277,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And most on Edith: like a storm he came,"
1278,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And shook the house, and like a storm he went."
1279,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1280,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Among the gifts he left her (possibly
1281,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He flow'd and ebb'd uncertain, to return"
1282,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"When others had been tested) there was one,"
1283,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A dagger, in rich sheath with jewels on it"
1284,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Sprinkled about in gold that branch'd itself
1285,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Fine as ice-ferns on January panes
1286,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Made by a breath.  I know not whence at first,"
1287,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Nor of what race, the work; but as he told"
1288,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The story, storming a hill-fort of thieves"
1289,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He got it; for their captain after fight,"
1290,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His comrades having fought their last below,"
1291,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Was climbing up the valley; at whom he shot:
1292,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Down from the beetling crag to which he clung
1293,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Tumbled the tawny rascal at his feet,"
1294,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"This dagger with him, which when now admired"
1295,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"By Edith whom his pleasure was to please,"
1296,AYLMER'S FIELD.,At once the costly Sahib yielded it to her.
1297,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1298,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And Leolin, coming after he was gone,"
1299,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Tost over all her presents petulantly:
1300,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And when she show'd the wealthy scabbard, saying"
1301,AYLMER'S FIELD.,'Look what a lovely piece of workmanship!'
1302,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Slight was his answer 'Well--I care not for it:'
1303,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Then playing with the blade he prick'd his hand,"
1304,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'A gracious gift to give a lady, this!'"
1305,AYLMER'S FIELD.,'But would it be more gracious' ask'd the girl
1306,AYLMER'S FIELD.,'Were I to give this gift of his to one
1307,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That is no lady?'  'Gracious?  No' said he.
1308,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'Me?--but I cared not for it.  O pardon me,"
1309,AYLMER'S FIELD.,I seem to be ungraciousness itself.'
1310,AYLMER'S FIELD.,'Take it' she added sweetly 'tho' his gift;
1311,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"For I am more ungracious ev'n than you,"
1312,AYLMER'S FIELD.,I care not for it either;' and he said
1313,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'Why then I love it:' but Sir Aylmer past,"
1314,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And neither loved nor liked the thing he heard.
1315,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1316,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The next day came a neighbor.  Blues and reds
1317,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"They talk'd of: blues were sure of it, he thought:"
1318,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Then of the latest fox--where started--kill'd
1319,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"In such a bottom: 'Peter had the brush,"
1320,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"My Peter, first:' and did Sir Aylmer know"
1321,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That great pock-pitten fellow had been caught?
1322,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Then made his pleasure echo, hand to hand,"
1323,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And rolling as it were the substance of it
1324,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Between his palms a moment up and down--
1325,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'The birds were warm, the birds were warm upon him;"
1326,AYLMER'S FIELD.,We have him now:' and had Sir Aylmer heard--
1327,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Nay, but he must--the land was ringing of it--"
1328,AYLMER'S FIELD.,This blacksmith-border marriage--one they knew--
1329,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Raw from the nursery--who could trust a child?
1330,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That cursed France with her egalities!
1331,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And did Sir Aylmer (deferentially
1332,AYLMER'S FIELD.,With nearing chair and lower'd accent) think--
1333,AYLMER'S FIELD.,For people talk'd--that it was wholly wise
1334,AYLMER'S FIELD.,To let that handsome fellow Averill walk
1335,AYLMER'S FIELD.,So freely with his daughter? people talk'd--
1336,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The boy might get a notion into him;
1337,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The girl might be entangled ere she knew.
1338,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Sir Aylmer Aylmer slowly stiffening spoke:
1339,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'The girl and boy, Sir, know their differences!'"
1340,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'Good' said his friend 'but watch!' and he 'enough,"
1341,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"More than enough, Sir!  I can guard my own.'"
1342,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"They parted, and Sir Aylmer Aylmer watch'd."
1343,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1344,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Pale, for on her the thunders of the house"
1345,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Had fallen first, was Edith that same night;"
1346,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Pale as the Jeptha's daughter, a rough piece"
1347,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Of early rigid color, under which"
1348,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Withdrawing by the counter door to that
1349,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Which Leolin open'd, she cast back upon him"
1350,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A piteous glance, and vanish'd.  He, as one"
1351,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Caught in a burst of unexpected storm,"
1352,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And pelted with outrageous epithets,"
1353,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Turning beheld the Powers of the House
1354,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"On either side the hearth, indignant; her,"
1355,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Cooling her false cheek with a featherfan,"
1356,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Him glaring, by his own stale devil spurr'd,"
1357,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And, like a beast hard-ridden, breathing hard."
1358,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'Ungenerous, dishonorable, base,"
1359,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Presumptuous! trusted as he was with her,"
1360,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The sole succeeder to their wealth, their lands,"
1361,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The last remaining pillar of their house,"
1362,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The one transmitter of their ancient name,"
1363,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Their child.'  'Our child!'  'Our heiress!'  'Ours!' for
1364,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"still,"
1365,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Like echoes from beyond a hollow, came"
1366,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Her sicklier iteration.  Last he said
1367,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'Boy, mark me! for your fortunes are to make."
1368,AYLMER'S FIELD.,I swear you shall not make them out of mine.
1369,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Now inasmuch as you have practised on her,"
1370,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Perplext her, made her half forget herself,"
1371,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Swerve from her duty to herself and us--
1372,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Things in an Aylmer deem'd impossible,"
1373,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Far as we track ourselves--I say that this,--"
1374,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Else I withdraw favor and countenance
1375,AYLMER'S FIELD.,From you and yours for ever--shall you do.
1376,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sir, when you see her--but you shall not see her--"
1377,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"No, you shall write, and not to her, but me:"
1378,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And you shall say that having spoken with me,"
1379,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And after look'd into yourself, you find"
1380,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That you meant nothing--as indeed you know
1381,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That you meant nothing.  Such as match as this!
1382,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Impossible, prodigious!'  These were words,"
1383,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"As meted by his measure of himself,"
1384,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Arguing boundless forbearance: after which,"
1385,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And Leolin's horror-stricken answer, 'I"
1386,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"So foul a traitor to myself and her,"
1387,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Never oh never,' for about as long"
1388,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"As the wind-hover hangs in the balance, paused"
1389,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sir Aylmer reddening from the storm within,"
1390,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Then broke all bonds of courtesy, and crying"
1391,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'Boy, should I find you by my doors again,"
1392,AYLMER'S FIELD.,My men shall lash you from the like a dog;
1393,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Hence!' with a sudden execration drove
1394,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The footstool from before him, and arose;"
1395,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"So, stammering 'scoundrel' out of teeth that ground"
1396,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"As in a dreadful dream, while Leolin still"
1397,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Retreated half-aghast, the fierce old man"
1398,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Follow'd, and under his own lintel stood"
1399,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Storming with lifted hands, a hoary face"
1400,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Meet for the reverence of the hearth, but now,"
1401,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Beneath a pale and unimpassion'd moon,"
1402,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Vext with unworthy madness, and deform'd."
1403,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1404,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Slowly and conscious of the rageful eye
1405,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That watch'd him, till he heard the ponderous door"
1406,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Close, crashing with long echoes thro' the land,"
1407,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Went Leolin; then, his passions all in flood"
1408,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And masters of his motion, furiously"
1409,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Down thro' the bright lawns to his brother's ran,"
1410,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And foam'd away his heart at Averill's ear:
1411,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Whom Averill solaced as he might, amazed:"
1412,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The man was his, had been his father's, friend:"
1413,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He must have seen, himself had seen it long;"
1414,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He must have known, himself had known: besides,"
1415,AYLMER'S FIELD.,He never yet had set his daughter forth
1416,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Here in the woman-markets of the west,"
1417,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Where our Caucasians let themselves be sold.
1418,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Some one, he thought, had slander'd Leolin to him."
1419,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'Brother, for I have loved you more as a son"
1420,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Than brother, let me tell you: I myself--"
1421,AYLMER'S FIELD.,What is their pretty saying? jilted is it?
1422,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Jilted I was: I say it for your peace.
1423,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Pain'd, and, as bearing in myself the shame"
1424,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The woman should have borne, humiliated,"
1425,AYLMER'S FIELD.,I lived for years a stunted sunless life;
1426,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Till after our good parents past away
1427,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Watching your growth, I seem'd again to grow."
1428,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Leolin, I almost sin in envying you:"
1429,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The very whitest lamb in all my fold
1430,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Loves you: I know her: the worst thought she has
1431,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Is whiter even than her pretty hand:
1432,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"She must prove true: for, brother, where two fight"
1433,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The strongest wins, and truth and love are strength,"
1434,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And you are happy: let her parents be.'
1435,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1436,AYLMER'S FIELD.,But Leolin cried out the more upon them--
1437,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Insolent, brainless, heartless! heiress, wealth,"
1438,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Their wealth, their heiress! wealth enough was theirs"
1439,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"For twenty matches.  Were he lord of this,"
1440,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Why, twenty boys and girls should marry on it,"
1441,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And forty blest ones bless him, and himself"
1442,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Be wealthy still, ay wealthier.  He believed"
1443,AYLMER'S FIELD.,This filthy marriage-hindering Mammon made
1444,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The harlot of the cities: nature crost
1445,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Was mother of the foul adulteries
1446,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That saturate soul with body.  Name, too! name,"
1447,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Their ancient name! they MIGHT be proud; its worth
1448,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Was being Edith's.  Ah, how pale she had look'd"
1449,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Darling, to-night! they must have rated her"
1450,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Beyond all tolerance.  These old pheasant-lords,"
1451,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"These partridge-breeders of a thousand years,"
1452,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Who had mildew'd in their thousands, doing nothing"
1453,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Since Egbert--why, the greater their disgrace!"
1454,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Fall back upon a name! rest, rot in that!"
1455,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Not KEEP it noble, make it nobler? fools,"
1456,AYLMER'S FIELD.,With such a vantage-ground for nobleness!
1457,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He had known a man, a quintessence of man,"
1458,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The life of all--who madly loved--and he,"
1459,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thwarted by one of these old father-fools,"
1460,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Had rioted his life out, and made an end."
1461,AYLMER'S FIELD.,He would not do it! her sweet face and faith
1462,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Held him from that: but he had powers, he knew it:"
1463,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Back would he to his studies, make a name,"
1464,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Name, fortune too: the world should ring of him"
1465,AYLMER'S FIELD.,To shame these mouldy Aylmers in their graves:
1466,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Chancellor, or what is greatest would he be--"
1467,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'O brother, I am grieved to learn your grief--"
1468,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Give me my fling, and let me say my say.'"
1469,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1470,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"At which, like one that sees his own excess,"
1471,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And easily forgives it as his own,"
1472,AYLMER'S FIELD.,He laugh'd; and then was mute; but presently
1473,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Wept like a storm: and honest Averill seeing
1474,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"How low his brother's mood had fallen, fetch'd"
1475,AYLMER'S FIELD.,His richest beeswing from a binn reserved
1476,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"For banquets, praised the waning red, and told"
1477,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The vintage--when THIS Aylmer came of age--
1478,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Then drank and past it; till at length the two,"
1479,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Tho' Leolin flamed and fell again, agreed"
1480,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That much allowance must be made for men.
1481,AYLMER'S FIELD.,After an angry dream this kindlier glow
1482,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Faded with morning, but his purpose held."
1483,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1484,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Yet once by night again the lovers met,"
1485,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A perilous meeting under the tall pines
1486,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That darken'd all the northward of her Hall.
1487,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Him, to her meek and modest bosom prest"
1488,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"In agony, she promised that no force,"
1489,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Persuasion, no, nor death could alter her:"
1490,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"He, passionately hopefuller, would go,"
1491,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Labor for his own Edith, and return"
1492,AYLMER'S FIELD.,In such a sunlight of prosperity
1493,AYLMER'S FIELD.,He should not be rejected.  'Write to me!
1494,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"They loved me, and because I love their child"
1495,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"They hate me: there is war between us, dear,"
1496,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Which breaks all bonds but ours; we must remain
1497,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sacred to one another.'  So they talk'd,"
1498,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Poor children, for their comfort: the wind blew;"
1499,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The rain of heaven, and their own bitter tears,"
1500,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Tears, and the careless rain of heaven, mixt"
1501,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Upon their faces, as they kiss'd each other"
1502,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"In darkness, and above them roar'd the pine."
1503,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1504,AYLMER'S FIELD.,So Leolin went; and as we task ourselves
1505,AYLMER'S FIELD.,To learn a language known but smatteringly
1506,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"In phrases here and there at random, toil'd"
1507,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Mastering the lawless science of our law,"
1508,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That codeless myriad of precedent,"
1509,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That wilderness of single instances,"
1510,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thro' which a few, by wit or fortune led,"
1511,AYLMER'S FIELD.,May beat a pathway out to wealth and fame.
1512,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The jests, that flash'd about the pleader's room,"
1513,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Lightning of the hour, the pun, the scurrilous tale,--"
1514,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Old scandals buried now seven decads deep
1515,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"In other scandals that have lived and died,"
1516,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And left the living scandal that shall die--
1517,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Were dead to him already; bent as he was
1518,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"To make disproof of scorn, and strong in hopes,"
1519,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And prodigal of all brain-labor he,"
1520,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Charier of sleep, and wine and exercise,"
1521,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Except when for a breathing-while at eve,"
1522,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Some niggard fraction of an hour, he ran"
1523,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Beside the river-bank: and then indeed
1524,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Harder the times were, and the hands of power"
1525,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Were bloodier, and the according hearts of men"
1526,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Seem'd harder too; but the soft river-breeze,"
1527,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Which fann'd the gardens of that rival rose
1528,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Yet fragrant in a heart remembering
1529,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His former talks with Edith, on him breathed"
1530,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Far purelier in his rushings to and fro,"
1531,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"After his books, to flush his blood with air,"
1532,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Then to his books again.  My lady's cousin,"
1533,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Half-sickening of his pension'd afternoon,"
1534,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Drove in upon the student once or twice,"
1535,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Ran a Malayan muck against the times,"
1536,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Had golden hopes for France and all mankind,"
1537,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Answer'd all queries touching those at home
1538,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"With a heaved shoulder and a saucy smile,"
1539,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And fain had haled him out into the world,"
1540,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And air'd him there: his nearer friend would say
1541,AYLMER'S FIELD.,'Screw not the chord too sharply lest it snap.'
1542,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Then left alone he pluck'd her dagger forth
1543,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"From where his worldless heart had kept it warm,"
1544,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Kissing his vows upon it like a knight.
1545,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And wrinkled benchers often talk'd of him
1546,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Approvingly, and prophesied his rise:"
1547,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"For heart, I think, help'd head: her letters too,"
1548,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Tho' far between, and coming fitfully"
1549,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Like broken music, written as she found"
1550,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Or made occasion, being strictly watch'd,"
1551,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Charm'd him thro' every labyrinth till he saw
1552,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"An end, a hope, a light breaking upon him."
1553,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1554,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"But they that cast her spirit into flesh,"
1555,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Her worldy-wise begetters, plagued themselves"
1556,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"To sell her, those good parents, for her good."
1557,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Whatever eldest-born of rank or wealth
1558,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Might lie within their compass, him they lured"
1559,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Into their net made pleasant by the baits
1560,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Of gold and beauty, wooing him to woo."
1561,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"So month by month the noise about their doors,"
1562,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And distant blaze of those dull banquets, made"
1563,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The nightly wirer of their innocent hare
1564,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Falter before he took it.  All in vain.
1565,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sullen, defiant, pitying, wroth, return'd"
1566,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Leolin's rejected rivals from their suit
1567,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"So often, that the folly taking wings"
1568,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Slipt o'er those lazy limits down the wind
1569,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"With rumor, and became in other fields"
1570,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A mockery to the yeomen over ale,"
1571,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And laughter to their lords: but those at home,"
1572,AYLMER'S FIELD.,As hunters round a hunted creature draw
1573,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The cordon close and closer toward the death,"
1574,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Narrow'd her goings out and comings in;
1575,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Forbad her first the house of Averill,"
1576,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Then closed her access to the wealthiest farms,"
1577,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Last from her own home-circle of the poor
1578,AYLMER'S FIELD.,They barr'd her: yet she bore it: yet her cheek
1579,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Kept color: wondrous! but, O mystery!"
1580,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"What amulet drew her down to that old oak,"
1581,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"So old, that twenty years before, a part"
1582,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Falling had let appear the brand of John--
1583,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Once grovelike, each huge arm a tree, but now"
1584,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The broken base of a black tower, a cave"
1585,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Of touchwood, with a single flourishing spray."
1586,AYLMER'S FIELD.,There the manorial lord too curiously
1587,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Raking in that millenial touchwood-dust
1588,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Found for himself a bitter treasure-trove;
1589,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Burst his own wyvern on the seal, and read"
1590,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Writhing a letter from his child, for which"
1591,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Came at the moment Leolin's emissary,"
1592,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A crippled lad, and coming turn'd to fly,"
1593,AYLMER'S FIELD.,But scared with threats of jail and halter gave
1594,AYLMER'S FIELD.,To him that fluster'd his poor parish wits
1595,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The letter which he brought, and swore besides"
1596,AYLMER'S FIELD.,To play their go-between as heretofore
1597,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Nor let them know themselves betray'd, and then,"
1598,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Soul-stricken at their kindness to him, went"
1599,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Hating his own lean heart and miserable.
1600,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1601,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Thenceforward oft from out a despot dream
1602,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Panting he woke, and oft as early as dawn"
1603,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Aroused the black republic on his elms,"
1604,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sweeping the frothfly from the fescue, brush'd"
1605,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thro' the dim meadow toward his treasure-trove,"
1606,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Seized it, took home, and to my lady, who made"
1607,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A downward crescent of her minion mouth,"
1608,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Listless in all despondence, read; and tore,"
1609,AYLMER'S FIELD.,As if the living passion symbol'd there
1610,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Were living nerves to feel the rent; and burnt,"
1611,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Now chafing at his own great self defied,"
1612,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Now striking on huge stumbling-blocks of scorn
1613,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"In babyisms, and dear diminutives"
1614,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Scatter'd all over the vocabulary
1615,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Of such a love as like a chidden babe,"
1616,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"After much wailing, hush'd itself at last"
1617,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Hopeless of answer: then tho' Averill wrote
1618,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And bad him with good heart sustain himself--
1619,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"All would be well--the lover heeded not,"
1620,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"But passionately restless came and went,"
1621,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And rustling once at night about the place,"
1622,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"There by a keeper shot at, slightly hurt,"
1623,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Raging return'd: nor was it well for her
1624,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Kept to the garden now, and grove of pines,"
1625,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Watch'd even there; and one was set to watch
1626,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The watcher, and Sir Aylmer watch'd them all,"
1627,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Yet bitterer from his readings: once indeed,"
1628,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Warm'd with his wines, or taking pride in her,"
1629,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"She look'd so sweet, he kiss'd her tenderly"
1630,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Not knowing what possess'd him: that one kiss
1631,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Was Leolin's one strong rival upon earth;
1632,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Seconded, for my lady follow'd suit,"
1633,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Seem'd hope's returning rose: and then ensued
1634,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A Martin's summer of his faded love,"
1635,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Or ordeal by kindness; after this
1636,AYLMER'S FIELD.,He seldom crost his child without a sneer;
1637,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The mother flow'd in shallower acrimonies:
1638,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Never one kindly smile, one kindly word:"
1639,AYLMER'S FIELD.,So that the gentle creature shut from all
1640,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Her charitable use, and face to face"
1641,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"With twenty months of silence, slowly lost"
1642,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Nor greatly cared to lose, her hold on life."
1643,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Last, some low fever ranging round to spy"
1644,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The weakness of a people or a house,"
1645,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Like flies that haunt a wound, or deer, or men,"
1646,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Or almost all that is, hurting the hurt--"
1647,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Save Christ as we believe him--found the girl
1648,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And flung her down upon a couch of fire,"
1649,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Where careless of the household faces near,"
1650,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And crying upon the name of Leolin,"
1651,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"She, and with her the race of Aylmer, past."
1652,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1653,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Star to star vibrates light: may soul to soul
1654,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Strike thro' a finer element of her own?
1655,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"So,--from afar,--touch as at once? or why"
1656,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That night, that moment, when she named his name,"
1657,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Did the keen shriek 'yes love, yes Edith, yes,'"
1658,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Shrill, till the comrade of his chambers woke,"
1659,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And came upon him half-arisen from sleep,"
1660,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"With a weird bright eye, sweating and trembling,"
1661,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His hair as it were crackling into flames,"
1662,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His body half flung forward in pursuit,"
1663,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And his long arms stretch'd as to grasp a flyer:
1664,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Nor knew he wherefore he had made the cry;
1665,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And being much befool'd and idioted
1666,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"By the rough amity of the other, sank"
1667,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"As into sleep again.  The second day,"
1668,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"My lady's Indian kinsman rushing in,"
1669,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A breaker of the bitter news from home,"
1670,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Found a dead man, a letter edged with death"
1671,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Beside him, and the dagger which himself"
1672,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Gave Edith, reddn'd with no bandit's blood:"
1673,AYLMER'S FIELD.,'From Edith' was engraven on the blade.
1674,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1675,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Then Averill went and gazed upon his death.
1676,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And when he came again, his flock believed--"
1677,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Beholding how the years which are not Time's
1678,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Had blasted him--that many thousand days
1679,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Were clipt by horror from his term of life.
1680,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Yet the sad mother, for the second death"
1681,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Scarce touch'd her thro' that nearness of the first,"
1682,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And being used to find her pastor texts,"
1683,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sent to the harrow'd brother, praying him"
1684,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"To speak before the people of her child,"
1685,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And fixt the Sabbath.  Darkly that day rose:
1686,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Autumn's mock sunshine of the faded woods
1687,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Was all the life of it; for hard on these,"
1688,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A breathless burthen of low-folded heavens
1689,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Stifled and chill'd at once: but every roof
1690,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Sent out a listener: many too had known
1691,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Edith among the hamlets round, and since"
1692,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The parents' harshness and the hapless loves
1693,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And double death were widely murmur'd, left"
1694,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Their own gray tower, or plain-faced tabernacle,"
1695,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"To hear him; all in mourning these, and those"
1696,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"With blots of it about them, ribbon, glove"
1697,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Or kerchief; while the church,--one night, except"
1698,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"For greenish glimmerings thro' the lancets,--made"
1699,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Still paler the pale head of him, who tower'd"
1700,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Above them, with his hopes in either grave."
1701,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1702,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Long o'er his bent brows linger'd Averill,"
1703,AYLMER'S FIELD.,His face magnetic to the hand from which
1704,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Livid he pluck'd it forth, and labor'd thro'"
1705,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His brief prayer-prelude, gave the verse 'Behold,"
1706,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Your house is left unto you desolate!'
1707,AYLMER'S FIELD.,But lapsed into so long a pause again
1708,AYLMER'S FIELD.,As half amazed half frighted all his flock:
1709,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Then from his height and loneliness of grief
1710,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Bore down in flood, and dash'd his angry heart"
1711,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Against the desolations of the world.
1712,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1713,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Never since our bad earth became one sea,"
1714,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Which rolling o'er the palaces of the proud,"
1715,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And all but those who knew the living God--
1716,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Eight that were left to make a purer world--
1717,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"When since had flood, fire, earthquake, thunder wrought"
1718,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Such waste and havoc as the idolatries,"
1719,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Which from the low light of mortality
1720,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Shot up their shadows to the Heaven of Heavens,"
1721,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And worshipt their own darkness as the Highest?
1722,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"'Gash thyself, priest, and honor thy brute Baal,"
1723,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And to thy worst self sacrifice thyself,"
1724,AYLMER'S FIELD.,For with thy worst self hast thou clothed thy God.'
1725,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Then came a Lord in no wise like to Baal.
1726,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The babe shall lead the lion.  Surely now
1727,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The wilderness shall blossom as the rose.
1728,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Crown thyself, worm, and worship thine own lusts!--"
1729,AYLMER'S FIELD.,No coarse and blockish God of acreage
1730,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Stands at thy gate for thee to grovel to--
1731,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Thy God is far diffused in noble groves
1732,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And princely halls, and farms, and flowing lawns,"
1733,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And heaps of living gold that daily grow,"
1734,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And title-scrolls and gorgeous heraldries.
1735,AYLMER'S FIELD.,In such a shape dost thou behold thy God.
1736,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Thou wilt not gash thy flesh for HIM; for thine
1737,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Fares richly, in fine linen, not a hair"
1738,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Ruffled upon the scarfskin, even while"
1739,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The deathless ruler of thy dying house
1740,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Is wounded to the death that cannot die;
1741,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And tho' thou numberest with the followers
1742,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Of One who cried 'leave all and follow me.'
1743,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thee therefore with His light about thy feet,"
1744,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thee with His message ringing in thine ears,"
1745,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thee shall thy brother man, the Lord from Heaven,"
1746,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Born of a village girl, carpenter's son,"
1747,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Wonderful, Prince of peace, the Mighty God,"
1748,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Count the more base idolater of the two;
1749,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Crueller: as not passing thro' the fire
1750,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Bodies, but souls--thy children's--thro' the smoke,"
1751,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The blight of low desires--darkening thine own
1752,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"To thine own likeness; or if one of these,"
1753,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thy better born unhappily from thee,"
1754,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Should, as by miracle, grow straight and fair--"
1755,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Friends, I was bid to speak of such a one"
1756,AYLMER'S FIELD.,By those who most have cause to sorrow for her--
1757,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Fairer than Rachel by the palmy well,"
1758,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Fairer than Ruth among the fields of corn,"
1759,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Fair as the Angel that said 'hail' she seem'd,"
1760,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Who entering fill'd the house with sudden light.
1761,AYLMER'S FIELD.,For so mine own was brighten'd: where indeed
1762,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The roof so lowly but that beam of Heaven
1763,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Dawn'd sometime thro' the doorway? whose the babe
1764,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Too ragged to be fondled on her lap,"
1765,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Warm'd at her bosom?  The poor child of shame,"
1766,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The common care whom no one cared for, leapt"
1767,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"To greet her, wasting his forgotten heart,"
1768,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"As with the mother he had never known,"
1769,AYLMER'S FIELD.,In gambols; for her fresh and innocent eyes
1770,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Had such a star of morning in their blue,"
1771,AYLMER'S FIELD.,That all neglected places of the field
1772,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Broke into nature's music when they saw her.
1773,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Low was her voice, but won mysterious way"
1774,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Thro' the seal'd ear to which a louder one
1775,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Was all but silence--free of alms her hand--
1776,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The hand that robed your cottage-walls with flowers
1777,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Has often toil'd to clothe your little ones;
1778,AYLMER'S FIELD.,How often placed upon the sick man's brow
1779,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Cool'd it, or laid his feverous pillow smooth!"
1780,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Had you one sorrow and she shared it not?
1781,AYLMER'S FIELD.,One burthen and she would not lighten it?
1782,AYLMER'S FIELD.,One spiritual doubt she did not soothe?
1783,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Or when some heat of difference sparkled out,"
1784,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"How sweetly would she glide between your wraths,"
1785,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And steal you from each other! for she walk'd
1786,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Wearing the light yoke of that Lord of love,"
1787,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Who still'd the rolling wave of Galilee!
1788,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And one--of him I was not bid to speak--
1789,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Was always with her, whom you also knew."
1790,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Him too you loved, for he was worthy love."
1791,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And these had been together from the first;
1792,AYLMER'S FIELD.,They might have been together till the last.
1793,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Friends, this frail bark of ours, when sorely tried,"
1794,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"May wreck itself without the pilot's guilt,"
1795,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Without the captain's knowledge: hope with me.
1796,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Whose shame is that, if he went hence with shame?"
1797,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Nor mine the fault, if losing both of these"
1798,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"I cry to vacant chairs and widow'd walls,"
1799,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"""My house is left unto me desolate."""
1800,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1801,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"While thus he spoke, his hearers wept; but some,"
1802,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sons of the glebe, with other frowns than those"
1803,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That knit themselves for summer shadow, scowl'd"
1804,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"At their great lord.  He, when it seem'd he saw"
1805,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"No pale sheet-lightnings from afar, but fork'd"
1806,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Of the near storm, and aiming at his head,"
1807,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Sat anger-charm'd from sorrow, soldierlike,"
1808,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Erect: but when the preacher's cadence flow'd
1809,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Softening thro' all the gentle attributes
1810,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Of his lost child, the wife, who watch'd his face,"
1811,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Paled at a sudden twitch of his iron mouth;
1812,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And 'O pray God that he hold up' she thought
1813,AYLMER'S FIELD.,'Or surely I shall shame myself and him.'
1814,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1815,AYLMER'S FIELD.,'Nor yours the blame--for who beside your hearths
1816,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Can take her place--if echoing me you cry
1817,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"""Our house is left unto us desolate?"""
1818,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"But thou, O thou that killest, hadst thou known,"
1819,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"O thou that stonest, hadst thou understood"
1820,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The things belonging to thy peace and ours!
1821,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Is there no prophet but the voice that calls
1822,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Doom upon kings, or in the waste 'Repent'?"
1823,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Is not our own child on the narrow way,"
1824,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Who down to those that saunter in the broad
1825,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Cries 'come up hither,' as a prophet to us?"
1826,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Is there no stoning save with flint and rock?
1827,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Yes, as the dead we weep for testify--"
1828,AYLMER'S FIELD.,No desolation but by sword and fire?
1829,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Yes, as your moanings witness, and myself"
1830,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Am lonelier, darker, earthlier for my loss."
1831,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Give me your prayers, for he is past your prayers,"
1832,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Not past the living fount of pity in Heaven.
1833,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"But I that thought myself long-suffering, meek,"
1834,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Exceeding ""poor in spirit""--how the words"
1835,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Have twisted back upon themselves, and mean"
1836,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Vileness, we are grown so proud--I wish'd my voice"
1837,AYLMER'S FIELD.,A rushing tempest of the wrath of God
1838,AYLMER'S FIELD.,To blow these sacrifices thro' the world--
1839,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Sent like the twelve-divided concubine
1840,AYLMER'S FIELD.,To inflame the tribes: but there--out yonder--earth
1841,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Lightens from her own central Hell--O there
1842,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The red fruit of an old idolatry--
1843,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The heads of chiefs and princes fall so fast,"
1844,AYLMER'S FIELD.,They cling together in the ghastly sack--
1845,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The land all shambles--naked marriages
1846,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Flash from the bridge, and ever-murder'd France,"
1847,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"By shores that darken with the gathering wolf,"
1848,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Runs in a river of blood to the sick sea.
1849,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Is this a time to madden madness then?
1850,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Was this a time for these to flaunt their pride?
1851,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"May Pharaoh's darkness, folds as dense as those"
1852,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Which hid the Holiest from the people's eyes
1853,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Ere the great death, shroud this great sin from all:"
1854,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Doubtless our narrow world must canvass it:
1855,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"O rather pray for those and pity them,"
1856,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Who thro' their own desire accomplish'd bring
1857,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Their own gray hairs with sorrow to the grave--
1858,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Who broke the bond which they desired to break,"
1859,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Which else had link'd their race with times to come--
1860,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Who wove coarse webs to snare her purity,"
1861,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Grossly contriving their dear daughter's good--
1862,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Poor souls, and knew not what they did, but sat"
1863,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Ignorant, devising their own daughter's death!"
1864,AYLMER'S FIELD.,May not that earthly chastisement suffice?
1865,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Have not our love and reverence left them bare?
1866,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Will not another take their heritage?
1867,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Will there be children's laughter in their hall
1868,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"For ever and for ever, or one stone"
1869,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Left on another, or is it a light thing"
1870,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"That I their guest, their host, their ancient friend,"
1871,AYLMER'S FIELD.,I made by these the last of all my race
1872,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Must cry to these the last of theirs, as cried"
1873,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Christ ere His agony to those that swore
1874,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Not by the temple but the gold, and made"
1875,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Their own traditions God, and slew the Lord,"
1876,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And left their memories a world's curse--""Behold,"
1877,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Your house is left unto you desolate?""'"
1878,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1879,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Ended he had not, but she brook'd no more:"
1880,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Long since her heart had beat remorselessly,"
1881,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Her crampt-up sorrow pain'd her, and a sense"
1882,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Of meanness in her unresisting life.
1883,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Then their eyes vext her; for on entering
1884,AYLMER'S FIELD.,He had cast the curtains of their seat aside--
1885,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Black velvet of the costliest--she herself
1886,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Had seen to that: fain had she closed them now,"
1887,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Yet dared not stir to do it, only near'd"
1888,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Her husband inch by inch, but when she laid,"
1889,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Wifelike, her hand in one of his, he veil'd"
1890,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His face with the other, and at once, as falls"
1891,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"A creeper when the prop is broken, fell"
1892,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The woman shrieking at his feet, and swoon'd."
1893,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Then her own people bore along the nave
1894,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Her pendent hands, and narrow meagre face"
1895,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Seam'd with the shallow cares of fifty years:
1896,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And here the Lord of all the landscape round
1897,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Ev'n to its last horizon, and of all"
1898,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Who peer'd at him so keenly, follow'd out"
1899,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Tall and erect, but in the middle aisle"
1900,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Reel'd, as a footsore ox in crowded ways"
1901,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Stumbling across the market to his death,"
1902,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Unpitied; for he groped as blind, and seem'd"
1903,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Always about to fall, grasping the pews"
1904,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And oaken finials till he touch'd the door;
1905,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Yet to the lychgate, where his chariot stood,"
1906,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Strode from the porch, tall and erect again."
1907,AYLMER'S FIELD.,
1908,AYLMER'S FIELD.,But nevermore did either pass the gate
1909,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Save under pall with bearers.  In one month,"
1910,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Thro' weary and yet wearier hours,"
1911,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The childless mother went to seek her child;
1912,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And when he felt the silence of his house
1913,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"About him, and the change and not the change,"
1914,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And those fixt eyes of painted ancestors
1915,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Staring for ever from their gilded walls
1916,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"On him their last descendant, his own head"
1917,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Began to droop, to fall; the man became"
1918,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Imbecile; his one word was 'desolate';
1919,AYLMER'S FIELD.,Dead for two years before his death was he;
1920,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"But when the second Christmas came, escaped"
1921,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"His keepers, and the silence which he felt,"
1922,AYLMER'S FIELD.,To find a deeper in the narrow gloom
1923,AYLMER'S FIELD.,By wife and child; nor wanted at his end
1924,AYLMER'S FIELD.,The dark retinue reverencing death
1925,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"At golden thresholds; nor from tender hearts,"
1926,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And those who sorrow'd o'er a vanish'd race,"
1927,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Pity, the violet on the tyrant's grave."
1928,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Then the great Hall was wholly broken down,"
1929,AYLMER'S FIELD.,And the broad woodland parcell'd into farms;
1930,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"And where the two contrived their daughter's good,"
1931,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Lies the hawk's cast, the mole has made his run,"
1932,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The hedgehog underneath the plaintain bores,"
1933,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The rabbit fondles his own harmless face,"
1934,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"The slow-worm creeps, and the thin weasel there"
1935,AYLMER'S FIELD.,"Follows the mouse, and all is open field."

1953,SEA DREAMS.,"One babe was theirs, a Margaret, three years old:"
1954,SEA DREAMS.,"They, thinking that her clear germander eye"
1955,SEA DREAMS.,"Droopt in the giant-factoried city-gloom,"
1956,SEA DREAMS.,"Came, with a month's leave given them, to the sea:"
1957,SEA DREAMS.,"For which his gains were dock'd, however small:"
1958,SEA DREAMS.,"Small were his gains, and hard his work; besides,"
1959,SEA DREAMS.,Their slender household fortunes (for the man
1960,SEA DREAMS.,"Had risk'd his little) like the little thrift,"
1961,SEA DREAMS.,Trembled in perilous places o'er a deep:
1962,SEA DREAMS.,"And oft, when sitting all alone, his face"
1963,SEA DREAMS.,"Would darken, as he cursed his credulousness,"
1964,SEA DREAMS.,"And that one unctuous mount which lured him, rogue,"
1965,SEA DREAMS.,To buy strange shares in some Peruvian mine.
1966,SEA DREAMS.,"Now seaward-bound for health they gain'd a coast,"
1967,SEA DREAMS.,"All sand and cliff and deep-inrunning cave,"
1968,SEA DREAMS.,"At close of day; slept, woke, and went the next,"
1969,SEA DREAMS.,"The Sabbath, pious variers from the church,"
1970,SEA DREAMS.,"To chapel; where a heated pulpiteer,"
1971,SEA DREAMS.,"Not preaching simple Christ to simple men,"
1972,SEA DREAMS.,"Announced the coming doom, and fulminated"
1973,SEA DREAMS.,Against the scarlet woman and her creed:
1974,SEA DREAMS.,"For sideways up he swung his arms, and shriek'd"
1975,SEA DREAMS.,"'Thus, thus with violence,' ev'n as if he held"

1977,SEA DREAMS.,Were that great Angel; 'Thus with violence
1978,SEA DREAMS.,Shall Babylon be cast into the sea;
1979,SEA DREAMS.,Then comes the close.'  The gentle-hearted wife
1980,SEA DREAMS.,Sat shuddering at the ruin of a world;
1981,SEA DREAMS.,He at his own: but when the wordy storm
1982,SEA DREAMS.,"Had ended, forth they came and paced the shore,"
1983,SEA DREAMS.,"Ran in and out the long sea-framing caves,"
1984,SEA DREAMS.,"Drank the large air, and saw, but scarce believed"
1985,SEA DREAMS.,(The sootflake of so many a summer still
1986,SEA DREAMS.,"Clung to their fancies) that they saw, the sea."
1987,SEA DREAMS.,"So now on sand they walk'd, and now on cliff,"
1988,SEA DREAMS.,"Lingering about the thymy promontories,"
1989,SEA DREAMS.,"Till all the sails were darken'd in the west,"
1990,SEA DREAMS.,And rosed in the east: then homeward and to bed:
1991,SEA DREAMS.,"Where she, who kept a tender Christian hope"
1992,SEA DREAMS.,"Haunting a holy text, and still to that"
1993,SEA DREAMS.,"Returning, as the bird returns, at night,"
1994,SEA DREAMS.,"'Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,'"
1995,SEA DREAMS.,"Said, 'Love, forgive him:' but he did not speak;"
1996,SEA DREAMS.,"And silenced by that silence lay the wife,"
1997,SEA DREAMS.,"Remembering her dear Lord who died for all,"
1998,SEA DREAMS.,"And musing on the little lives of men,"
1999,SEA DREAMS.,And how they mar this little by their feuds.
2000,SEA DREAMS.,
2001,SEA DREAMS.,"But while the two were sleeping, a full tide"
2002,SEA DREAMS.,"Rose with ground-swell, which, on the foremost rocks"
2003,SEA DREAMS.,"Touching, upjetted in spirts of wild sea-smoke,"
2004,SEA DREAMS.,"And scaled in sheets of wasteful foam, and fell"
2005,SEA DREAMS.,In vast sea-cataracts--ever and anon
2006,SEA DREAMS.,Dead claps of thunder from within the cliffs
2007,SEA DREAMS.,"Heard thro' the living roar.  At this the babe,"
2008,SEA DREAMS.,"Their Margaret cradled near them, wail'd and woke"
2009,SEA DREAMS.,"The mother, and the father suddenly cried,"
2010,SEA DREAMS.,"'A wreck, a wreck!' then turn'd, and groaning said,"
2011,SEA DREAMS.,
2012,SEA DREAMS.,"'Forgive!  How many will say, ""forgive,"" and find"
2013,SEA DREAMS.,A sort of absolution in the sound
2014,SEA DREAMS.,To hate a little longer!  No; the sin

2016,SEA DREAMS.,"Hypocrisy, I saw it in him at once."
2017,SEA DREAMS.,Is it so true that second thoughts are best?
2018,SEA DREAMS.,"Not first, and third, which are a riper first?"
2019,SEA DREAMS.,"Too ripe, too late! they come too late for use."
2020,SEA DREAMS.,"Ah love, there surely lives in man and beast"
2021,SEA DREAMS.,Something divine to warn them of their foes:
2022,SEA DREAMS.,"And such a sense, when first I fronted him,"
2023,SEA DREAMS.,"Said, ""trust him not;"" but after, when I came"
2024,SEA DREAMS.,"To know him more, I lost it, knew him less;"
2025,SEA DREAMS.,Fought with what seem'd my own uncharity;
2026,SEA DREAMS.,Sat at his table; drank his costly wines;
2027,SEA DREAMS.,Made more and more allowance for his talk;
2028,SEA DREAMS.,"Went further, fool! and trusted him with all,"
2029,SEA DREAMS.,All my poor scrapings from a dozen years
2030,SEA DREAMS.,"Of dust and deskwork: there is no such mine,"
2031,SEA DREAMS.,"None; but a gulf of ruin, swallowing gold,"
2032,SEA DREAMS.,Not making.  Ruin'd! ruin'd! the sea roars
2033,SEA DREAMS.,Ruin: a fearful night!'
2034,SEA DREAMS.,
2035,SEA DREAMS.,"'Not fearful; fair,'"
2036,SEA DREAMS.,"Said the good wife, 'if every star in heaven"
2037,SEA DREAMS.,Can make it fair: you do but bear the tide.
2038,SEA DREAMS.,Had you ill dreams?'
2039,SEA DREAMS.,
2040,SEA DREAMS.,"'O yes,' he said, 'I dream'd"
2041,SEA DREAMS.,"Of such a tide swelling toward the land,"
2042,SEA DREAMS.,And I from out the boundless outer deep
2043,SEA DREAMS.,"Swept with it to the shore, and enter'd one"
2044,SEA DREAMS.,Of those dark caves that run beneath the cliffs.
2045,SEA DREAMS.,I thought the motion of the boundless deep
2046,SEA DREAMS.,"Bore through the cave, and I was heaved upon it"
2047,SEA DREAMS.,In darkness: then I saw one lovely star
2048,SEA DREAMS.,"Larger and larger.  ""What a world,"" I thought,"
2049,SEA DREAMS.,"""To live in!"" but in moving I found"
2050,SEA DREAMS.,"Only the landward exit of the cave,"
2051,SEA DREAMS.,Bright with the sun upon the stream beyond:
2052,SEA DREAMS.,"And near the light a giant woman sat,"
2053,SEA DREAMS.,"All over earthy, like a piece of earth,"
2054,SEA DREAMS.,A pickaxe in her hand: then out I slipt
2055,SEA DREAMS.,"Into a land all of sun and blossom, trees"
2056,SEA DREAMS.,"As high as heaven, and every bird that sings:"
2057,SEA DREAMS.,And here the night-light flickering in my eyes
2058,SEA DREAMS.,Awoke me.'
2059,SEA DREAMS.,
2060,SEA DREAMS.,"'That was then your dream,' she said,"
2061,SEA DREAMS.,"'Not sad, but sweet.'"
2062,SEA DREAMS.,
2063,SEA DREAMS.,"'So sweet, I lay,' said he,"
2064,SEA DREAMS.,"'And mused upon it, drifting up the stream"
2065,SEA DREAMS.,"In fancy, till I slept again, and pieced"
2066,SEA DREAMS.,The broken vision; for I dream'd that still
2067,SEA DREAMS.,"The motion of the great deep bore me on,"
2068,SEA DREAMS.,And that the woman walk'd upon the brink:
2069,SEA DREAMS.,"I wonder'd at her strength, and ask'd her of it:"
2070,SEA DREAMS.,"""It came,"" she said, ""by working in the mines:"""
2071,SEA DREAMS.,"O then to ask her of my shares, I thought;"
2072,SEA DREAMS.,And ask'd; but not a word; she shook her head.
2073,SEA DREAMS.,"And then the motion of the current ceased,"
2074,SEA DREAMS.,And there was rolling thunder; and we reach'd
2075,SEA DREAMS.,"A mountain, like a wall of burs and thorns;"
2076,SEA DREAMS.,But she with her strong feet up the steep hill
2077,SEA DREAMS.,Trod out a path: I follow'd; and at top
2078,SEA DREAMS.,"She pointed seaward: there a fleet of glass,"
2079,SEA DREAMS.,"That seem'd a fleet of jewels under me,"
2080,SEA DREAMS.,Sailing along before a gloomy cloud
2081,SEA DREAMS.,"That not one moment ceased to thunder, past"
2082,SEA DREAMS.,"In sunshine: right across its track there lay,"
2083,SEA DREAMS.,"Down in the water, a long reef of gold,"
2084,SEA DREAMS.,Or what seem'd gold: and I was glad at first
2085,SEA DREAMS.,To think that in our often-ransack'd world
2086,SEA DREAMS.,Still so much gold was left; and then I fear'd
2087,SEA DREAMS.,"Lest the gay navy there should splinter on it,"
2088,SEA DREAMS.,And fearing waved my arm to warn them off;
2089,SEA DREAMS.,"An idle signal, for the brittle fleet"
2090,SEA DREAMS.,"(I thought I could have died to save it) near'd,"
2091,SEA DREAMS.,"Touch'd, clink'd, and clash'd, and vanish'd, and I woke,"
2092,SEA DREAMS.,I heard the clash so clearly.  Now I see
2093,SEA DREAMS.,My dream was Life; the woman honest Work;
2094,SEA DREAMS.,And my poor venture but a fleet of glass
2095,SEA DREAMS.,Wreck'd on a reef of visionary gold.'
2096,SEA DREAMS.,
2097,SEA DREAMS.,"'Nay,' said the kindly wife to comfort him,"
2098,SEA DREAMS.,"'You raised your arm, you tumbled down and broke"
2099,SEA DREAMS.,The glass with little Margaret's medicine it it;
2100,SEA DREAMS.,"And, breaking that, you made and broke your dream:"
2101,SEA DREAMS.,"A trifle makes a dream, a trifle breaks.'"
2102,SEA DREAMS.,
2103,SEA DREAMS.,"'No trifle,' groan'd the husband; 'yesterday"
2104,SEA DREAMS.,"I met him suddenly in the street, and ask'd"
2105,SEA DREAMS.,That which I ask'd the woman in my dream.
2106,SEA DREAMS.,"Like her, he shook his head.  ""Show me the books!"""
2107,SEA DREAMS.,He dodged me with a long and loose account.
2108,SEA DREAMS.,"""The books, the books!"" but he, he could not wait,"
2109,SEA DREAMS.,Bound on a matter he of life and death:
2110,SEA DREAMS.,When the great Books (see Daniel seven and ten)
2111,SEA DREAMS.,"Were open'd, I should find he meant me well;"
2112,SEA DREAMS.,"And then began to bloat himself, and ooze"
2113,SEA DREAMS.,All over with the fat affectionate smile
2114,SEA DREAMS.,"That makes the widow lean.  ""My dearest friend,"
2115,SEA DREAMS.,"Have faith, have faith!  We live by faith,"" said he;"
2116,SEA DREAMS.,"""And all things work together for the good"
2117,SEA DREAMS.,"Of those""--it makes me sick to quote him--last"
2118,SEA DREAMS.,"Gript my hand hard, and with God-bless-you went."
2119,SEA DREAMS.,I stood like one that had received a blow:
2120,SEA DREAMS.,"I found a hard friend in his loose accounts,"
2121,SEA DREAMS.,"A loose one in the hard grip of his hand,"
2122,SEA DREAMS.,A curse in his God-bless-you: then my eyes
2123,SEA DREAMS.,"Pursued him down the street, and far away,"
2124,SEA DREAMS.,"Among the honest shoulders of the crowd,"
2125,SEA DREAMS.,"Read rascal in the motions of his back,"
2126,SEA DREAMS.,And scoundrel in the supple-sliding knee.'
2127,SEA DREAMS.,
2128,SEA DREAMS.,"'Was he so bound, poor soul?' said the good wife;"
2129,SEA DREAMS.,"'So are we all: but do not call him, love,"
2130,SEA DREAMS.,"Before you prove him, rogue, and proved, forgive."
2131,SEA DREAMS.,His gain is loss; for he that wrongs his friend
2132,SEA DREAMS.,"Wrongs himself more, and ever bears about"
2133,SEA DREAMS.,"A silent court of justice in his breast,"
2134,SEA DREAMS.,"Himself the judge and jury, and himself"
2135,SEA DREAMS.,"The prisoner at the bar, ever condemn'd:"
2136,SEA DREAMS.,And that drags down his life: then comes what comes
2137,SEA DREAMS.,"Hereafter: and he meant, he said he meant,"
2138,SEA DREAMS.,"Perhaps he meant, or partly meant, you well.'"
2139,SEA DREAMS.,
2140,SEA DREAMS.,"'""With all his conscience and one eye askew""--"
2141,SEA DREAMS.,"Love, let me quote these lines, that you may learn"
2142,SEA DREAMS.,"A man is likewise counsel for himself,"
2143,SEA DREAMS.,"Too often, in that silent court of yours--"
2144,SEA DREAMS.,"""With all his conscience and one eye askew,"
2145,SEA DREAMS.,"So false, he partly took himself for true;"
2146,SEA DREAMS.,"Whose pious talk, when most his heart was dry,"
2147,SEA DREAMS.,Made wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye;
2148,SEA DREAMS.,"Who, never naming God except for gain,"
2149,SEA DREAMS.,So never took that useful name in vain;
2150,SEA DREAMS.,"Made Him his catspaw and the Cross his tool,"
2151,SEA DREAMS.,And Christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool;
2152,SEA DREAMS.,"Nor deeds of gift, but gifts of grace he forged,"
2153,SEA DREAMS.,And snakelike slimed his victim ere he gorged;
2154,SEA DREAMS.,"And oft at Bible meetings, o'er the rest"
2155,SEA DREAMS.,"Arising, did his holy oily best,"
2156,SEA DREAMS.,"Dropping the too rough H in Hell and Heaven,"
2157,SEA DREAMS.,"To spread the Word by which himself had thriven."""
2158,SEA DREAMS.,How like you this old satire?'
2159,SEA DREAMS.,
2160,SEA DREAMS.,"'Nay,' she said"
2161,SEA DREAMS.,"'I loathe it: he had never kindly heart,"
2162,SEA DREAMS.,"Nor ever cared to better his own kind,"
2163,SEA DREAMS.,"Who first wrote satire, with no pity in it."
2164,SEA DREAMS.,"But will you hear MY dream, for I had one"
2165,SEA DREAMS.,That altogether went to music?  Still
2166,SEA DREAMS.,It awed me.'
2167,SEA DREAMS.,
2168,SEA DREAMS.,"Then she told it, having dream'd"
2169,SEA DREAMS.,Of that same coast.
2170,SEA DREAMS.,
2171,SEA DREAMS.,"--But round the North, a light,"
2172,SEA DREAMS.,"A belt, it seem'd, of luminous vapor, lay,"
2173,SEA DREAMS.,And ever in it a low musical note
2174,SEA DREAMS.,"Swell'd up and died; and, as it swell'd, a ridge"
2175,SEA DREAMS.,"Of breaker issued from the belt, and still"
2176,SEA DREAMS.,"Grew with the growing note, and when the note"
2177,SEA DREAMS.,"Had reach'd a thunderous fullness, on those cliffs"
2178,SEA DREAMS.,"Broke, mixt with awful light (the same as that"
2179,SEA DREAMS.,Living within the belt) whereby she saw
2180,SEA DREAMS.,"That all those lines of cliffs were cliffs no more,"
2181,SEA DREAMS.,"But huge cathedral fronts of every age,"
2182,SEA DREAMS.,"Grave, florid, stern, as far as eye could see."
2183,SEA DREAMS.,"One after one: and then the great ridge drew,"
2184,SEA DREAMS.,"Lessening to the lessening music, back,"
2185,SEA DREAMS.,And past into the belt and swell'd again
2186,SEA DREAMS.,Slowly to music: ever when it broke
2187,SEA DREAMS.,"The statues, king or saint, or founder fell;"
2188,SEA DREAMS.,Then from the gaps and chasms of ruin left
2189,SEA DREAMS.,"Came men and women in dark clusters round,"
2190,SEA DREAMS.,"Some crying, ""Set them up! they shall not fall!"""
2191,SEA DREAMS.,"And others ""Let them lie, for they have fall'n."""
2192,SEA DREAMS.,And still they strove and wrangled: and she grieved
2193,SEA DREAMS.,"In her strange dream, she knew not why, to find"
2194,SEA DREAMS.,Their wildest wailings never out of tune
2195,SEA DREAMS.,With that sweet note; and ever as their shrieks
2196,SEA DREAMS.,"Ran highest up the gamut, that great wave"
2197,SEA DREAMS.,"Returning, while none mark'd it, on the crowd"
2198,SEA DREAMS.,"Broke, mixt with awful light, and show'd their eyes"
2199,SEA DREAMS.,"Glaring, and passionate looks, and swept away"
2200,SEA DREAMS.,"The men of flesh and blood, and men of stone,"
2201,SEA DREAMS.,To the waste deeps together.
2202,SEA DREAMS.,
2203,SEA DREAMS.,'Then I fixt
2204,SEA DREAMS.,"My wistful eyes on two fair images,"
2205,SEA DREAMS.,"Both crown'd with stars and high among the stars,--"
2206,SEA DREAMS.,The Virgin Mother standing with her child
2207,SEA DREAMS.,High up on one of those dark minster-fronts--
2208,SEA DREAMS.,"Till she began to totter, and the child"
2209,SEA DREAMS.,"Clung to the mother, and sent out a cry"
2210,SEA DREAMS.,"Which mixt with little Margaret's, and I woke,"
2211,SEA DREAMS.,And my dream awed me:--well--but what are dreams?
2212,SEA DREAMS.,"Yours came but from the breaking of a glass,"
2213,SEA DREAMS.,And mine but from the crying of a child.'
2214,SEA DREAMS.,
2215,SEA DREAMS.,"'Child?  No!' said he, 'but this tide's roar, and his,"
2216,SEA DREAMS.,"Our Boanerges with his threats of doom,"
2217,SEA DREAMS.,And loud-lung'd Antibabylonianisms
2218,SEA DREAMS.,(Altho' I grant but little music there)
2219,SEA DREAMS.,Went both to make your dream: but if there were
2220,SEA DREAMS.,"A music harmonizing our wild cries,"
2221,SEA DREAMS.,"Sphere-music such as that you dream'd about,"
2222,SEA DREAMS.,"Why, that would make our passions far too like"
2223,SEA DREAMS.,The discords dear to the musician.  No--
2224,SEA DREAMS.,One shriek of hate would jar all the hymns of heaven:
2225,SEA DREAMS.,"True Devils with no ear, they howl in tune"
2226,SEA DREAMS.,With nothing but the Devil!'
2227,SEA DREAMS.,
2228,SEA DREAMS.,"'""True"" indeed!"
2229,SEA DREAMS.,"One of our town, but later by an hour"
2230,SEA DREAMS.,"Here than ourselves, spoke with me on the shore;"
2231,SEA DREAMS.,"While you were running down the sands, and made"
2232,SEA DREAMS.,"The dimpled flounce of the sea-furbelow flap,"
2233,SEA DREAMS.,"Good man, to please the child.  She brought strange news."
2234,SEA DREAMS.,Why were you silent when I spoke to-night?
2235,SEA DREAMS.,I had set my heart on your forgiving him
2236,SEA DREAMS.,Before you knew.  We MUST forgive the dead.'
2237,SEA DREAMS.,
2238,SEA DREAMS.,'Dead! who is dead?'
2239,SEA DREAMS.,
2240,SEA DREAMS.,'The man your eye pursued.
2241,SEA DREAMS.,"A little after you had parted with him,"
2242,SEA DREAMS.,He suddenly dropt dead of heart-disease.'
2243,SEA DREAMS.,
2244,SEA DREAMS.,'Dead? he? of heart-disease? what heart had he
2245,SEA DREAMS.,To die of? dead!'
2246,SEA DREAMS.,
2247,SEA DREAMS.,"'Ah, dearest, if there be"
2248,SEA DREAMS.,"A devil in man, there is an angel too,"
2249,SEA DREAMS.,"And if he did that wrong you charge him with,"
2250,SEA DREAMS.,His angel broke his heart.  But your rough voice
2251,SEA DREAMS.,(You spoke so loud) has roused the child again.
2252,SEA DREAMS.,"Sleep, little birdie, sleep! will she not sleep"
2253,SEA DREAMS.,"Without her ""little birdie?"" well then, sleep,"
2254,SEA DREAMS.,"And I will sing you ""birdie.""'"
2255,SEA DREAMS.,
2256,SEA DREAMS.,"Saying this,"
2257,SEA DREAMS.,"The woman half turn'd round from him she loved,"
2258,SEA DREAMS.,"Left him one hand, and reaching thro' the night"
2259,SEA DREAMS.,"Her other, found (for it was close beside)"
2260,SEA DREAMS.,And half embraced the basket cradle-head
2261,SEA DREAMS.,"With one soft arm, which, like the pliant bough"
2262,SEA DREAMS.,"That moving moves the nest and nestling, sway'd"
2263,SEA DREAMS.,"The cradle, while she sang this baby song."
2264,SEA DREAMS.,
2265,SEA DREAMS.,What does the little birdie say
2266,SEA DREAMS.,In her nest at peep of day?
2267,SEA DREAMS.,"Let me fly, says little birdie,"
2268,SEA DREAMS.,"Mother, let me fly away."
2269,SEA DREAMS.,"Birdie, rest a little longer,"
2270,SEA DREAMS.,Till the little wings are stronger.
2271,SEA DREAMS.,"So she rests a little longer,"
2272,SEA DREAMS.,Then she flies away.
2273,SEA DREAMS.,
2274,SEA DREAMS.,"What does little baby say,"
2275,SEA DREAMS.,In her bed at peep of day?
2276,SEA DREAMS.,"Baby says, like little birdie,"
2277,SEA DREAMS.,Let me rise and fly away.
2278,SEA DREAMS.,"Baby, sleep a little longer,"
2279,SEA DREAMS.,Till the little limbs are stronger.
2280,SEA DREAMS.,"If she sleeps a little longer,"
2281,SEA DREAMS.,Baby too shall fly away.
2282,SEA DREAMS.,
2283,SEA DREAMS.,"'She sleeps: let us too, let all evil, sleep."
2284,SEA DREAMS.,He also sleeps--another sleep than ours.
2285,SEA DREAMS.,"He can do no more wrong: forgive him, dear,"
2286,SEA DREAMS.,And I shall sleep the sounder!'
2287,SEA DREAMS.,
2288,SEA DREAMS.,"Then the man,"
2289,SEA DREAMS.,"'His deeds yet live, the worst is yet to come."
2290,SEA DREAMS.,Yet let your sleep for this one night be sound:

2317,I.,Never the wife for Willy: he would n't take my advice.
2318,I.,
2319,II.,II.

2334,III.,'Here's a leg for a babe of a week!' says doctor; and
2335,III.,"he would be bound,"
2336,III.,There was not his like that year in twenty parishes

2339,IV.,IV.
2340,IV.,"Strong of his hands, and strong on his legs, but still of"

2342,IV.,I ought to have gone before him: I wonder he went
2343,IV.,so young.
2344,IV.,"I cannot cry for him, Annie: I have not long to"

2350,V.,"Why do you look at me, Annie? you think I am hard"

2364,VI.,"I mean your grandfather, Annie: it cost me a world"

2366,VI.,"Seventy years ago, my darling, seventy years"

2368,VI.,
2369,VII.,VII.
2370,VII.,"For Jenny, my cousin, had come to the place, and I"

2374,VII.,"And she to be coming and slandering me, the base"

2384,VIII.,That a lie which is all a lie may be met and fought

2398,IX.,
2399,X.,X.
2400,X.,"And I cried myself well-nigh blind, and all of an"
2401,X.,evening late
2402,X.,"I climb'd to the top of the garth, and stood by the"
2403,X.,road at the gate.
2404,X.,The moon like a rick on fire was rising over the
2405,X.,"dale,"
2406,X.,"And whit, whit, whit, in the bush beside me chirrupt"
2407,X.,the nightingale.
2408,X.,
2409,XI.,XI.
2410,XI.,All of a sudden he stopt: there past by the gate of
2411,XI.,"the farm,"
2412,XI.,"Willy,--he did n't see me,--and Jenny hung on his"
2413,XI.,arm.
2414,XI.,"Out into the road I started, and spoke I scarce knew"
2415,XI.,how;
2416,XI.,"Ah, there's no fool like the old one--it makes me"
2417,XI.,angry now.
2418,XI.,
2419,XII.,XII.
2420,XII.,"Willy stood up like a man, and look'd the thing that"
2421,XII.,he meant;
2422,XII.,"Jenny, the viper, made me a mocking courtesy and"
2423,XII.,went.
2424,XII.,"And I said, 'Let us part: in a hundred years it'll all"
2425,XII.,"be the same,"
2426,XII.,"You cannot love me at all, if you love not my good"
2427,XII.,name.'
2428,XII.,
2429,XIII.,XIII.
2430,XIII.,"And he turn'd, and I saw his eyes all wet, in the sweet"
2431,XIII.,moonshine:
2432,XIII.,"Sweetheart, I love you so well that your good name"
2433,XIII.,is mine.
2434,XIII.,"And what do I care for Jane, let her speak of you well"
2435,XIII.,of ill;
2436,XIII.,But marry me out of hand: we two shall be happy
2437,XIII.,still.'
2438,XIII.,
2439,XIV.,XIV.
2440,XIV.,"'Marry you, Willy!' said I, 'but I needs must speak"
2441,XIV.,"my mind,"
2442,XIV.,"And I fear you'll listen to tales, be jealous and hard"
2443,XIV.,and unkind.'
2444,XIV.,"But he turn'd and claspt me in his arms, and answer'd,"
2445,XIV.,"'No, love, no;'"
2446,XIV.,"Seventy years ago, my darling, seventy years"
2447,XIV.,ago.
2448,XIV.,
2449,XV.,XV.
2450,XV.,So Willy and I were wedded: I wore a lilac
2451,XV.,gown;
2452,XV.,"And the ringers rang with a will, and he gave the"
2453,XV.,ringers a crown.
2454,XV.,But the first that ever I bare was dead before he was
2455,XV.,"born,"
2456,XV.,"Shadow and shine is life, little Annie, flower and"
2457,XV.,thorn.
2458,XV.,
2459,XVI.,XVI.
2460,XVI.,"That was the first time, too, that ever I thought of"
2461,XVI.,death.
2462,XVI.,There lay the sweet little body that never had drawn
2463,XVI.,a breath.
2464,XVI.,"I had not wept, little Anne, not since I had been a"
2465,XVI.,wife;
2466,XVI.,"But I wept like a child that day, for the babe had"
2467,XVI.,fought for his life.
2468,XVI.,
2469,XVII.,XVII.
2470,XVII.,"His dear little face was troubled, as if with anger or"
2471,XVII.,pain:
2472,XVII.,I look'd at the still little body--his trouble had all
2473,XVII.,been in vain.
2474,XVII.,"For Willy I cannot weep, I shall see him another"
2475,XVII.,morn:
2476,XVII.,But I wept like a child for the child that was dead
2477,XVII.,before he was born.
2478,XVII.,
2479,XVIII.,XVIII.
2480,XVIII.,"But he cheer'd me, my good man, for he seldom said me"
2481,XVIII.,nay:
2482,XVIII.,"Kind, like a man, was he; like a man, too, would have"
2483,XVIII.,his way:
2484,XVIII.,Never jealous--not he: we had many a happy
2485,XVIII.,year;
2486,XVIII.,"And he died, and I could not weep--my own time"
2487,XVIII.,seem'd so near.
2488,XVIII.,
2489,XIX.,XIX.
2490,XIX.,"But I wish'd it had been God's will that I, too, then"
2491,XIX.,could have died:
2492,XIX.,"I began to be tired a little, and fain had slept at his"
2493,XIX.,side.
2494,XIX.,"And that was ten years back, or more, if I don't"
2495,XIX.,forget:
2496,XIX.,"But as to the children, Annie, they're all about me"
2497,XIX.,yet.
2498,XIX.,
2499,XX.,XX.
2500,XX.,"Pattering over the boards, my Annie who left me at"
2501,XX.,"two,"
2502,XX.,"Patter she goes, my own little Annie, an Annie like"
2503,XX.,you:
2504,XX.,"Pattering over the boards, she comes and goes at her"
2505,XX.,"will,"
2506,XX.,While Harry is in the five-acre and Charlie ploughing
2507,XX.,the hill.
2508,XX.,
2509,XXI.,XXI.
2510,XXI.,"And Harry and Charlie, I hear them too--they sing"
2511,XXI.,to their team:
2512,XXI.,Often they come to the door in a pleasant kind of a
2513,XXI.,dream.
2514,XXI.,"They come and sit by my chair, they hover about my"
2515,XXI.,bed--
2516,XXI.,I am not always certain if they be alive or
2517,XXI.,dead.
2518,XXI.,
2519,XXII.,XXII.
2520,XXII.,"And yet I know for a truth, there's none of them"
2521,XXII.,left alive;
2522,XXII.,"For Harry went at sixty, your father at sixty-five:"
2523,XXII.,"And Willy, my eldest born, at nigh threescore and"
2524,XXII.,ten;
2525,XXII.,"I knew them all as babies, and now they're elderly"
2526,XXII.,men.
2527,XXII.,
2528,XXIII.,XXIII.
2529,XXIII.,"For mine is a time of peace, it is not often I"
2530,XXIII.,grieve;
2531,XXIII.,I am oftener sitting at home in my father's farm
2532,XXIII.,at eve:
2533,XXIII.,"And the neighbors come and laugh and gossip, and"
2534,XXIII.,so do I;
2535,XXIII.,I find myself often laughing at things that have long
2536,XXIII.,gone by.
2537,XXIII.,
2538,XXIV.,XXIV.
2539,XXIV.,"To be sure the preacher says, our sins should make"
2540,XXIV.,us sad:
2541,XXIV.,"But mine is a time of peace, and there is Grace to"

2543,XXIV.,"And God, not man, is the Judge of us all when life"
2544,XXIV.,shall cease;

2546,XXIV.,Peace.
2547,XXIV.,
2548,XXV.,XXV.
2549,XXV.,"And age is a time of peace, so it be free from"
2550,XXV.,"pain,"
2551,XXV.,And happy has been my life; but I would not live
2552,XXV.,it again.
2553,XXV.,"I seem to be tired a little, that's all, and long for"
2554,XXV.,rest;
2555,XXV.,"Only at your age, Annie, I could have wept with the"
2556,XXV.,best.
2557,XXV.,
2558,XXVI.,XXVI.
2559,XXVI.,"So Willy has gone, my beauty, my eldest-born, my"
2560,XXVI.,flower;
2561,XXVI.,"But how can I weep for Willy, he has but gone for"
2562,XXVI.,"an hour,--"
2563,XXVI.,"Gone for a minute, my son, from this room into the"
2564,XXVI.,next;
2565,XXVI.,"I, too, shall go in a minute.  What time have I to"
2566,XXVI.,be vext?
2567,XXVI.,
2568,XXVII.,XXVII.
2569,XXVII.,"And Willy's wife has written, she never was over-wise."
2570,XXVII.,"Get me my glasses, Annie: thank God that I keep"
2571,XXVII.,my eyes.
2572,XXVII.,"There is but a trifle left you, when I shall have past"
