61,PREFACE.,
62,PREFACE.,
63,PREFACE.,"The author[1] of the present Volume, in tendering his sincere thanks to"
64,PREFACE.,"the gentlemen of Her Majesty’s Customs,[2] and to his other numerous and"
65,PREFACE.,"kind patrons, who so liberally subscribed towards the publication of his"
66,PREFACE.,"little work, assures them that he is deeply sensible of his obligations"
67,PREFACE.,to them for the almost uniform courtesy with which his solicitations
68,PREFACE.,were met; because (being perfectly conscious at the onset of his
69,PREFACE.,undertaking how necessary it was to prepare to subject himself to censure
70,PREFACE.,"as well as approbation, and to arm himself with those indispensable"
71,PREFACE.,"virtues—patience, perseverance, endurance, and thankfulness, without"
72,PREFACE.,"which the attempt would have been futile, and being also aware that"
73,PREFACE.,nothing but a favourable response to his appeal could possibly lead to
74,PREFACE.,the accomplishment of his object) the success which has attended his
75,PREFACE.,efforts is certainly far beyond what might have been expected by one in
76,PREFACE.,so humble and so obscure a position in life.
77,PREFACE.,
78,PREFACE.,"There is, however, one gentleman[3] in particular to whom it is the"
79,PREFACE.,"Author’s duty to be—if ’twere possible—more than grateful, for his"
80,PREFACE.,generous condescension in permitting the manuscripts to be placed in his
81,PREFACE.,"hands for perusal, and who—after surveying a portion of them—not only"
82,PREFACE.,"recommended the method of publication which was adopted, but gave effect"
83,PREFACE.,to his advice by kindly becoming the first subscriber to the work—for
84,PREFACE.,the Author never would have presumed to publish these poems on his own
85,PREFACE.,"personal estimation of whatever merit they may possess, so that unless"
86,PREFACE.,such an impetus had been given to the project it is more than probable he
87,PREFACE.,never would have had the gratification of seeing them produced in their
88,PREFACE.,present form.
89,PREFACE.,
90,PREFACE.,"This the Author hopes will afford to his numerous subscribers, and to"
91,PREFACE.,"those in whose hands it may perchance happen to fall, a not unreasonable"
92,PREFACE.,excuse for his having intruded himself into the unmerciful arena of
93,PREFACE.,"poetical literature, and, perhaps, be the means of saving his little"
94,PREFACE.,work—the product of his leisure hours—from being thrust into the gloomy
95,PREFACE.,recesses of oblivion.

3855,E. E. FOOT.,
3856,E. E. FOOT.,PROLOGUE.—It may be considered presumptuous of the Author that he should
3857,E. E. FOOT.,have dared to venture in the paths of Allegory; but since he has been
3858,E. E. FOOT.,"guilty of doing so, he must bear whatever chastisement may be inflicted"
3859,E. E. FOOT.,"upon him. The Poem is intended, in the first instance, to illustrate in"
3860,E. E. FOOT.,"a figurative manner the frailty of the human mind—or rather, the natural"
3861,E. E. FOOT.,"propensity of the human heart—in the pursuit of pleasure; which, if not"
3862,E. E. FOOT.,"mercifully prevented by the interposition of Divine Providence, tends to"
3863,E. E. FOOT.,create an insatiate desire for new and unattainable delights; fosters
3864,E. E. FOOT.,an intemperate habit; promotes an incessant craving after carnal joys;
3865,E. E. FOOT.,"and which inevitably involves a person in the whirlpool of vice, and"
3866,E. E. FOOT.,"ultimately leads to the destruction of the Soul. In the second instance,"
3867,E. E. FOOT.,to depict (according to the Author’s humble ideas) the manner of mystic
3868,E. E. FOOT.,glorification—instituted by the Sovereign of the Outer World—continually
3869,E. E. FOOT.,"going on in the dominions of his Satanic Majesty; but which, to the"
3870,E. E. FOOT.,"unredeemed souls of departed creatures, is the sad state of everlasting"
3871,E. E. FOOT.,"torment, consequent to perdition. And thirdly, the Author hopes this"
3872,E. E. FOOT.,representation[106] of the unblissful regions may have the effect of
3873,E. E. FOOT.,"retarding, at least—in some degree, the appetite for the pleasures, or"
3874,E. E. FOOT.,he would say: vanities of this life; and of eventually averting the evil
3875,E. E. FOOT.,"and direful calamity, by—“Turning the hearts of the disobedient unto the"
3876,E. E. FOOT.,wisdom of the just.”
3877,E. E. FOOT.,
3878,E. E. FOOT.,[106] For it scarcely can be believed that there is such a place in
3879,E. E. FOOT.,"reality—viz., of a tangible nature; but if so, in what direction of the"
3880,E. E. FOOT.,boundless Profound can it be? and where are we to look for it?

3903,CANTO THE FIRST.,And every branch adds to her queenly pride:
3904,CANTO THE FIRST.,Yet she hath many sorrows to endure;
3905,CANTO THE FIRST.,"For, as the season comes from year to year,"
3906,CANTO THE FIRST.,The pruner’s blade (like as the surgeon’s knife)
3907,CANTO THE FIRST.,Makes deep incisions to prolong her life.
3908,CANTO THE FIRST.,Oh! how she mourns when one by one are fled
3909,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Those purple beauties which she bore and bred,"
3910,CANTO THE FIRST.,And nurtur’d in the glory of her age—
3911,CANTO THE FIRST.,The admiration of her country’s sage:

3921,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The golden fountain of the rarest wines,"
3922,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To-day, resembling the to-day of yore,"
3923,CANTO THE FIRST.,Yielding their complements of luscious store;
3924,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Observe the varied hues, and fragrancy,"
3925,CANTO THE FIRST.,When fiery Leo’s[109] in th’ ascendancy.
3926,CANTO THE FIRST.,’Twas there that Bacchus[110] strove t’obtain a glimpse
3927,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Whilst the imperial company of nymphs,"
3928,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Assembled at the high command of Jove,"
3929,CANTO THE FIRST.,Were interchanging sentiments of love!—
3930,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And where Apollo,[111] with unusual strains"
3931,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Inspired his instrument, and thus obtains"
3932,CANTO THE FIRST.,The fairest goddess of the mystic throng;
3933,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Who, dumb with the enchantment of his song,"
3934,CANTO THE FIRST.,Makes loving gestures that she heeds his suit;
3935,CANTO THE FIRST.,"He, in return, becomes as equally mute:"
3936,CANTO THE FIRST.,But his fair countenance pourtray’d his heart:
3937,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then full of joy they wing’d their golden cart,"
3938,CANTO THE FIRST.,And vanish’d in th’ ethereal realms of bliss.
3939,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Now, when the other nymphs Apollo miss,"
3940,CANTO THE FIRST.,"They veil’d their faces with their flowing hair,"
3941,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And smote their bosoms, sighing in despair,—"
3942,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Weeping lamentingly,—for each in vain"
3943,CANTO THE FIRST.,Had sought the great musician’s hand to gain:
3944,CANTO THE FIRST.,Not as before—bewitchingly in gait—
3945,CANTO THE FIRST.,"But lovelorn now, and openly await"
3946,CANTO THE FIRST.,Each for a god or whomsoever may
3947,CANTO THE FIRST.,Possess the courage to come there to play.
3948,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Bacchus, not oftentimes as then so shrewd,"

3950,CANTO THE FIRST.,"He, great in stature, bearded to the waist,"
3951,CANTO THE FIRST.,"True to his character (refresh’d with rest),"
3952,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Avail’d himself of Leo’s brightest hour,"

3954,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Like a fat ox, his loins were fair to view,—"
3955,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The pith of happiness,—he never knew"
3956,CANTO THE FIRST.,"What sorrow was. Ashamed, the nymphs now hide,"
3957,CANTO THE FIRST.,And in their hiding-place they scan his side
3958,CANTO THE FIRST.,But not a sound escapes their lovely lips:—
3959,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The while, he taps a thousand globes and sips"
3960,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Until he staggers, and falls prone to ground:"
3961,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then haste the nymphs, the god they circle round!"
3962,CANTO THE FIRST.,’Tis vain attempting to describe the joy
3963,CANTO THE FIRST.,Each goddess felt as they tripp’d round so coy:—
3964,CANTO THE FIRST.,"One, stray’ng beyond the bound’ry they had plann’d,"
3965,CANTO THE FIRST.,Most inadvertently trod on his hand;
3966,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Which ’lectrified the god! then he updrew,"
3967,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Rais’d both his arms, and, like a trumpet, blew"
3968,CANTO THE FIRST.,A sound across the purple-cluster’d plain.
3969,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Altho’ he lack’d Apollo’s dulcet strain,"
3970,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The nymphs admired him for his manly look,"
3971,CANTO THE FIRST.,For when he moved the very vineprops shook;
3972,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Yea—when he spake, the clouds obey’d his voice,"
3973,CANTO THE FIRST.,And stood divided that he might rejoice
3974,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Beneath the oriental mid-day sky,"
3975,CANTO THE FIRST.,With Sol direct on his revolving eye.
3976,CANTO THE FIRST.,"His golden goblet, he with outstretch’d arms"
3977,CANTO THE FIRST.,"(Which, with the god, possess’d peculiar charms),"
3978,CANTO THE FIRST.,Held forth towards the sun!—when there advanced
3979,CANTO THE FIRST.,"A hundred nymphs, on whom, like fire he glanced:"
3980,CANTO THE FIRST.,Bold as a warrior he induced them all
3981,CANTO THE FIRST.,To come and drink from out his flowing bowl!
3982,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The nymphs, unable to resist, attend"
3983,CANTO THE FIRST.,Obediently to Bacchus’s command:
3984,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The god surveys them as they raise the cup,"
3985,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And, as they drink in turn, he fills it up;—"
3986,CANTO THE FIRST.,"When all have drunk their loving draught, the god"
3987,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Lifts high the goblet, and vouchsafes a nod,"
3988,CANTO THE FIRST.,And bids the mistress of the fairy throng
3989,CANTO THE FIRST.,Arrange the company to join in song;
3990,CANTO THE FIRST.,"She, in obedience to the god’s command,"
3991,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Waved her white beam, and thus commenc’d the band:—"
3992,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The high sopranos rock the fragrant breeze,"
3993,CANTO THE FIRST.,And lift their voices up by slow degrees
3994,CANTO THE FIRST.,Until they reach the pinnacle of sound;
3995,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The first great stanza done, then, most profound,"
3996,CANTO THE FIRST.,The sweet contraltos follow in their course—
3997,CANTO THE FIRST.,Ascending and descending with much force
3998,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And regulated emphasis, and then,"
3999,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Uniting, send into the sunnied main"
4000,CANTO THE FIRST.,"One burst of harmony! the god then leapt,"
4001,CANTO THE FIRST.,And—overwhelm’d with ecstasy—he wept.

4007,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Reviewing those fair daughters of the moon,"
4008,CANTO THE FIRST.,When they struck off their soul-enraptured tune!
4009,CANTO THE FIRST.,"For there he sat, crown’d with the purple vine,"
4010,CANTO THE FIRST.,And by his side his goblet of red wine:
4011,CANTO THE FIRST.,At every strain which lifted up his soul
4012,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The monarch smil’d, and bow’d, inclined the bowl:"
4013,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Again, again, he smote his sunburnt breast,"
4014,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And sent Orion[112] to hunt down a beast,—"
4015,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To Comus[113] also to prepare a feast,—"
4016,CANTO THE FIRST.,"That he might entertain the goddesses,"
4017,CANTO THE FIRST.,And make them creatures of much happiness.
4018,CANTO THE FIRST.,"So Bacchus, rev’ling thus in his desires,"
4019,CANTO THE FIRST.,With flooded brain to heav’n at once aspires.
4020,CANTO THE FIRST.,His saffron body sweated down in rills.
4021,CANTO THE FIRST.,"At length, o’erpower’d, he frenzically calls"
4022,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To Jupiter,[114] “O Brother, come to me,"
4023,CANTO THE FIRST.,Bring down five thousand gods to help the glee!

4025,CANTO THE FIRST.,Give gen’rously thy aid that I may live!—

4028,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And lordly Herschel,[116] junior of the skies;"
4029,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And Mercury,[117] with those sharp propitious eyes:"
4030,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Tell Saturn,[118] also, that I would he’d come"
4031,CANTO THE FIRST.,To share with me the comforts of my home:
4032,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Earth, goodly creature, is already here"
4033,CANTO THE FIRST.,With bountiful provision of good cheer:
4034,CANTO THE FIRST.,"I fain would Sol invite, but fear my fate,"
4035,CANTO THE FIRST.,Lest the great god should think himself too great:
4036,CANTO THE FIRST.,O! what a blaze of glory there would be
4037,CANTO THE FIRST.,If he would condescend to join the glee
4038,CANTO THE FIRST.,"But for an hour, or even but a half:"
4039,CANTO THE FIRST.,"O! would not Bacchus bid the guests to quaff,"
4040,CANTO THE FIRST.,Each with a goblet bumper’d up to brim?
4041,CANTO THE FIRST.,And would not Bacchus even worship him?

4048,CANTO THE FIRST.,"He pauses, mutters, bows his head, and swoons;"

4056,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then, gather’d ’round him, all the fairy hosts—"
4057,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Pale and affrighted, like so many ghosts—"
4058,CANTO THE FIRST.,Perform a solemn requiem for his soul.
4059,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Still stood the sun, and dark; but in the bowl,[119]"
4060,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The rosy liquid flamed a cubit high,"
4061,CANTO THE FIRST.,To mourn poor Bacchus’ death: those standing by
4062,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Withdrew in sorrow; one by one they fled,—"
4063,CANTO THE FIRST.,For all conceiv’d their benefactor dead!
4064,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then rose a cloudling, circular in shape,"

4066,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Its outer edge, fring’d round with silvery foil,"
4067,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Bent gently downwards, archlike, to the soil;"
4068,CANTO THE FIRST.,So that an hemisphere of cloud conceal’d
4069,CANTO THE FIRST.,The god’s huge body from the open field.
4070,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To Bacchus’ prayers[120] the heavenly orbs attend,"
4071,CANTO THE FIRST.,And with precision to the earth descend:
4072,CANTO THE FIRST.,They search the vineyard o’er from end to end;
4073,CANTO THE FIRST.,"’Round and about they trip, with angels’ speed;"
4074,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Alas, they falter! then they (all agreed)"
4075,CANTO THE FIRST.,Cry unto Bacchus—“Bacchus! Bacchus! where—
4076,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Where art thou gone? Behold thy guests are here,—"
4077,CANTO THE FIRST.,All clothed in kingly garments of the best
4078,CANTO THE FIRST.,"We’ve come, as bidden, down to join the feast;"
4079,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Each with a garland delicately bloomed,"
4080,CANTO THE FIRST.,And every one his instrument well tuned:
4081,CANTO THE FIRST.,Our cloud-wrought chariots in the heavens await
4082,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To take us back, each to his own retreat,"
4083,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And thou not here! Oh, cruel god, why this?"
4084,CANTO THE FIRST.,Thou’st robbed us of anticipated bliss!—
4085,CANTO THE FIRST.,"We heard your loud petition, and came down;"
4086,CANTO THE FIRST.,"But what is here? and where, where art thou gone?"
4087,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Fie on thee, god! Thou’rt treacherous indeed;"
4088,CANTO THE FIRST.,"For we have come to thee with utmost speed,"
4089,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Aroused, in joy, to expectation’s height,"
4090,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And hoped for day; but lo, ’tis all as night!”"
4091,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then they confer, and hence resolved to fly"
4092,CANTO THE FIRST.,Back to their mansions in the azure sky.

4096,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The clouds dispers’d, and Bacchus starts afresh,"
4097,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Drinks deep the purple, which inflames his flesh;"
4098,CANTO THE FIRST.,Sends his rude orisons again on high;
4099,CANTO THE FIRST.,"But they heed not his pray’rs: then, with a sigh,"
4100,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And almost mad, he strikes his breast, and saith:"
4101,CANTO THE FIRST.,"“Ye gods, be damn’d.” And now, all in a breath,"
4102,CANTO THE FIRST.,"He uttereth a prayer to him above,"
4103,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Beseeching, plaintively, the mighty Jove:"
4104,CANTO THE FIRST.,"“Oh, well-beloved Jove! I pray thee, hear"
4105,CANTO THE FIRST.,"My tale of sorrow, which to thee I bear."
4106,CANTO THE FIRST.,"O Jove, acquainted with my nature best,"
4107,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Thou know’st, alone, the cravings of my breast;"
4108,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Fann’d by the nymphs’ most inspirating strain,"
4109,CANTO THE FIRST.,"I sought the bowl, and fired my foolish brain:"
4110,CANTO THE FIRST.,"I cried aloud to thee, as Jupiter,"
4111,CANTO THE FIRST.,"But lacked, I ween, a right interpreter:"
4112,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To Venus and to Mars I rais’d my voice,"
4113,CANTO THE FIRST.,For they were three respectively my choice;
4114,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To Georgian-Herschel, and to Mercury;"
4115,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To Saturn, but ’twas vain. ’Twas vanity,"
4116,CANTO THE FIRST.,"I’ll own; yet was it not, O Jove, most cruel—"
4117,CANTO THE FIRST.,Now I am old—to treat me as a fool?”
4118,CANTO THE FIRST.,So he continued venting loud his pray’r:
4119,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Deserted and distracted to despair,"
4120,CANTO THE FIRST.,"He tried to lift the goblet, but he fail’d;"
4121,CANTO THE FIRST.,"His strength had fled, he found himself assail’d"
4122,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And at the gate of hell!—still struggling hard,"
4123,CANTO THE FIRST.,"He ope’d his mouth, but uttered not a word:"
4124,CANTO THE FIRST.,He mock’d the gods with his fast fleeting breath;
4125,CANTO THE FIRST.,Gave up the ghost: thus met eternal death!
4126,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4127,CANTO THE FIRST.,*       *       *       *       *
4128,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4129,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Three days, or more, the god lay prostrate, bare,"
4130,CANTO THE FIRST.,"With naught of covering save his ruffled hair,"
4131,CANTO THE FIRST.,"(And not a creature chancèd to come near,)"
4132,CANTO THE FIRST.,Stretched to his full across his bed of leaves;
4133,CANTO THE FIRST.,"His hands were clench’d, as firm as iron greaves;"
4134,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And there he laid; when Daphne,[121] passing by,"
4135,CANTO THE FIRST.,Caught the reflection of his glaring eye
4136,CANTO THE FIRST.,"(For Bacchus died not, as most mortal men,"
4137,CANTO THE FIRST.,"With eyes fast shut, but open to the sun),"
4138,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And, like a good Samaritan, went o’er:"
4139,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Rememb’ring well the visage which he bore,"
4140,CANTO THE FIRST.,She exclaim’d aloud to her great lord[122] of heaven—
4141,CANTO THE FIRST.,"(As she, poor nymph, was most severely smitten)—"
4142,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Crying, “Bassareus[123] lies breathless on the field!"
4143,CANTO THE FIRST.,No wounds to show he has been gored or steel’d;
4144,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And now, aghast, his eyes still move around,"
4145,CANTO THE FIRST.,"His lips are quivering, and I hear a sound"
4146,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Like that of Rhadamanthus (Judge of hell),"
4147,CANTO THE FIRST.,But what his converse is I cannot tell.”
4148,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Her lord came down, most sorrowful in look,"
4149,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Conn’d the dead body, and again betook"
4150,CANTO THE FIRST.,"His brazen chariot in all haste, and rode"
4151,CANTO THE FIRST.,Down to the regions of the infernal god:
4152,CANTO THE FIRST.,There was rejoicing to a great extent:—
4153,CANTO THE FIRST.,A thousand fires lit up the firmament;
4154,CANTO THE FIRST.,"A myriad spirits danced around the flames,"
4155,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Each calling Bacchus by a thousand names,"
4156,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And each, like Argus, had a hundred eyes,"
4157,CANTO THE FIRST.,Which direfully glared across the den of lies;
4158,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Their heads were horn’d, and each horn bore a lamp,"
4159,CANTO THE FIRST.,Mark’d with the great immortal Pluto’s stamp;
4160,CANTO THE FIRST.,"(Pluto[124] himself, being ninety leagues away,"
4161,CANTO THE FIRST.,Was unacquainted with this revelry—
4162,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Till Vulcan[125] forged a bolt with wings, and sent"
4163,CANTO THE FIRST.,It in a whirlwind unto Pluto’s tent;
4164,CANTO THE FIRST.,Therein it stood and wrote upon the wall
4165,CANTO THE FIRST.,The brief particulars of the carnival!
4166,CANTO THE FIRST.,"This mighty god,[126] astounded to the heart,"
4167,CANTO THE FIRST.,Made hasty preparations to depart;
4168,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Sent forth his voice, then ’roused his gloomy host,"
4169,CANTO THE FIRST.,And travell’d ’round by the south-western coast.)
4170,CANTO THE FIRST.,And each one held two red-hot iron beams;
4171,CANTO THE FIRST.,Their breath ascended in sulphurous streams:
4172,CANTO THE FIRST.,"They foamed and snorted, like hard-ridden horse,"
4173,CANTO THE FIRST.,And fled across the grim and deathy course
4174,CANTO THE FIRST.,With comets’ speed; then stamp’d with awful force
4175,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Their ponderous forms upon th’ upheaving ground,"
4176,CANTO THE FIRST.,Which sent afar a hideous crackling sound:
4177,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The foam ran down their breasts like molten flame,—"
4178,CANTO THE FIRST.,Too dreadful to describe by any name;
4179,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Their mouths, when open, were like rocky caves—"
4180,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Down their vast throats the Styx[127] rush’d in great waves,"
4181,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And when they spat, a stench obnoxious ’rose—"
4182,CANTO THE FIRST.,Offensive to the most inurèd nose.
4183,CANTO THE FIRST.,Around their waists were slung huge buffalo horns
4184,CANTO THE FIRST.,"(And farther down hung girdles of black thorns),"
4185,CANTO THE FIRST.,"With which they went three times a day for drink,"
4186,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And stood around that dread Avernus’ brink,[128]"
4187,CANTO THE FIRST.,Without attempt from the foul task to shrink;
4188,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then, at a word, into the lake they went,"
4189,CANTO THE FIRST.,Whose waters were of dreadful temperament:
4190,CANTO THE FIRST.,"They plunged therein as horses gored to death,"
4191,CANTO THE FIRST.,And sent forth pois’nous vapours with their breath.
4192,CANTO THE FIRST.,Three times a day the ghastly livid lake
4193,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Turn’d into blood, with which their thirst they’d slake:"
4194,CANTO THE FIRST.,"When brass-hair’d Vulcan struck his mighty gong,"
4195,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Erect they stood, and join’d in woful song,"
4196,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Another beat, they stretch’d their glaring eyes,"
4197,CANTO THE FIRST.,And sent a shriek into the red-wrought skies;[129]

4203,CANTO THE FIRST.,At the command of this volcanic lord!)
4204,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Once more he beat, they rais’d a dismal moan,—"
4205,CANTO THE FIRST.,Sustain’d their voices till a day was gone:

4207,CANTO THE FIRST.,"They durst not breathe, nor even wink an eye."
4208,CANTO THE FIRST.,"(Oh! what a shocking, melancholy fate,"
4209,CANTO THE FIRST.,To be the vassals of such low estate:

4234,CANTO THE FIRST.,Which bore the numbers of their brazen carts:
4235,CANTO THE FIRST.,’Twould take a day to count the numbers o’er:
4236,CANTO THE FIRST.,"At length they advance with a continuous roar,"
4237,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Dividing as they sped the sulph’ral air,"
4238,CANTO THE FIRST.,Midst fetid vapours like the fumes of war.
4239,CANTO THE FIRST.,Now as they approach with a most deaf’ning noise—
4240,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Sixteen abreast arranged, to counterpoise"
4241,CANTO THE FIRST.,The basement of the cloud on which they rode—
4242,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The mighty host beheld, beheld their god!"
4243,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4244,CANTO THE FIRST.,*       *       *       *       *
4245,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4246,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Meanwhile—the mighty Vulcan (at his works),"
4247,CANTO THE FIRST.,And all his host were welding monster dirks
4248,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Of brass and steel; and in each point, an eye"
4249,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Was fixèd to conduct it through the sky,"
4250,CANTO THE FIRST.,Where it was plann’d that at a given word
4251,CANTO THE FIRST.,Each instrument of death should fly abroad
4252,CANTO THE FIRST.,"At equal distances, directed straight"
4253,CANTO THE FIRST.,To meet the foe who dare oppose the fête.
4254,CANTO THE FIRST.,In warlike attitude th’ inferior fiends
4255,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Stood all abreast, and facing the west winds,"
4256,CANTO THE FIRST.,"(Each held a dirk four cubits in the air,"
4257,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And on their breast were brazen shields of war,)—"
4258,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Full fifteen rows, each row a yard advanc’d:"
4259,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And in the rear ten thousand horses pranc’d,"
4260,CANTO THE FIRST.,All cap’rison’d with choicest workmanship:
4261,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Each rider held a silver-threaded whip,"
4262,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Of ponderous weight, which rested on his hip"
4263,CANTO THE FIRST.,On his right side; whilst on the left were hung
4264,CANTO THE FIRST.,A massive sabre and a silver gong.
4265,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Behind them were arranged each curricle,"
4266,CANTO THE FIRST.,To form a background to the spectacle:
4267,CANTO THE FIRST.,"According to their numbers in rotation,"
4268,CANTO THE FIRST.,And to the high or low degree of station
4269,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Of those great potentates, so did they stand—"
4270,CANTO THE FIRST.,Prim in their aspect and exceeding’ grand.
4271,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The chariots’ sides, inlaid with burnish’d gold,"
4272,CANTO THE FIRST.,Reflected all surrounding them two-fold;
4273,CANTO THE FIRST.,"On every roof there ’rose a tow’ring rod,"
4274,CANTO THE FIRST.,Which bore the banner of each minor god;
4275,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The charioteers wore helmets, wrought of brass;"
4276,CANTO THE FIRST.,And all their faces shone like silver’d glass.
4277,CANTO THE FIRST.,"From north to south three leagues of ground were dark,"
4278,CANTO THE FIRST.,Through this great cloud incumbent o’er the park;
4279,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And not a voice was heard, not e’en a breath,"
4280,CANTO THE FIRST.,So strict was the command. (A second death
4281,CANTO THE FIRST.,Was the sad fate for those who disobey’d
4282,CANTO THE FIRST.,Th’ injunctions and the laws therein decreed.)
4283,CANTO THE FIRST.,"All, conscious that their lord was on his way"
4284,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Back to his seat of fame and royalty,"
4285,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Now look’d direct towards the bloodshot heav’n,"
4286,CANTO THE FIRST.,Through which the god of misery was driv’n;
4287,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The lurid light increased its sickly tint,"
4288,CANTO THE FIRST.,And shed its glare about the continent:
4289,CANTO THE FIRST.,Near to the zenith of the mystic main
4290,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Appear’d the shadow of th’ advancing train,—"
4291,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Small as a hand, but rapid in its growth,—"
4292,CANTO THE FIRST.,As on they came upon the yellow path:
4293,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Great as a mountain the dire shade had grown,"
4294,CANTO THE FIRST.,When suddenly a dreadful blast was blown
4295,CANTO THE FIRST.,By fifty heralds in the foremost cloud;
4296,CANTO THE FIRST.,"They blew again, but fifty times more loud,"
4297,CANTO THE FIRST.,"So that the atmosphere of hell did quake,"
4298,CANTO THE FIRST.,And caus’d a hissing like a python snake.
4299,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then came the thunder of the chariot wheels,"
4300,CANTO THE FIRST.,Like cannons roaring on a thousand hills.
4301,CANTO THE FIRST.,A thousand chariots did the train compose:
4302,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And then the tramping of the horse arose,"
4303,CANTO THE FIRST.,Fell on the ears with dire and dreadful woe
4304,CANTO THE FIRST.,Of those who listen’d with dismay: when lo!
4305,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The heavens open’d! * * * Vulcan struck his gong,"
4306,CANTO THE FIRST.,And all the multitude burst forth in song:
4307,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Which song appall’d th’ ambassador of earth,[130]—"
4308,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The great musician, minstrel, bard of mirth,—"
4309,CANTO THE FIRST.,Who now was there with his attendant gods
4310,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Array’d in splendour, holding silver rods,"
4311,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To greet the Emperor, as the monarch came"
4312,CANTO THE FIRST.,Down from the clouds in crimson-colour’d flame.
4313,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4314,CANTO THE FIRST.,*       *       *       *       *
4315,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4316,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Apollo, garmented in robes of gold,—"
4317,CANTO THE FIRST.,"His stature like a giant to behold,—"
4318,CANTO THE FIRST.,"With voice unmatch’d in compass and in tone,"
4319,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Pour’d forth his song, which vibrated the zone:"
4320,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Its text was this—“Hail, Pluto, mighty king;”—"
4321,CANTO THE FIRST.,Then all Apollo’s minstrels ’round him sing
4322,CANTO THE FIRST.,"“Hail, Pluto, mighty King!” re-echoing"
4323,CANTO THE FIRST.,The song of triumph to the utmost bounds
4324,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Of the dread region, in concordant sounds."
4325,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The multitude manœuvred, gather’d in,"
4326,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And form’d an ambient circle; where, within,"
4327,CANTO THE FIRST.,His Majesty appointed his descent.
4328,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The vassals, marshall’d, to the rearward went."
4329,CANTO THE FIRST.,"So that the inner ring contain’d the great,—"
4330,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Such as th’ renownèd Minos, magistrate,"
4331,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Androgeüs, his son; then, great in name,"
4332,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Stood Rhadamanthus, ’nother judge of fame;"
4333,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Æacus, Acheron; and poor Protheus, who,"
4334,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Vex’d with his form, into great Etna flew;"
4335,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And by his side Prometheus, martyr’d god,"
4336,CANTO THE FIRST.,Who form’d and fired with life a moulded clod:
4337,CANTO THE FIRST.,"There, terrible in mien, stood Mulciber,[131]—"
4338,CANTO THE FIRST.,"He, on his breast, a group of medals bore—"
4339,CANTO THE FIRST.,Marks of distinction for those mighty things
4340,CANTO THE FIRST.,Which he had wrought through ages past for kings;
4341,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then his son Cacus, junior god of fire;"
4342,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And next, perfidious Sisyphus, the liar;"
4343,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then Erebus, son of the Invisible;[132]"
4344,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And grim old Charon, ferryman of hell."
4345,CANTO THE FIRST.,At equal distances those magnates stood
4346,CANTO THE FIRST.,About this circle of great magnitude
4347,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Much in themselves, but all subordinate"
4348,CANTO THE FIRST.,"To Pluto; who, now in great pomp and state,"
4349,CANTO THE FIRST.,Was in their midst: there He (awaiting him
4350,CANTO THE FIRST.,The harbinger of joy—Earth’s seraphim)
4351,CANTO THE FIRST.,"With pow’rful speech and accent, call’d aloud—"
4352,CANTO THE FIRST.,"“Come hither, O Apollo!” Forth went the god,"
4353,CANTO THE FIRST.,"When there uprose a nevious curling cloud,"
4354,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Great in circumference, and six fathoms up,"
4355,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Bulg’d at its sides, in form like as a cup,"
4356,CANTO THE FIRST.,Less at its base; and round about the same
4357,CANTO THE FIRST.,"There spread an horizontal ardent flame,"
4358,CANTO THE FIRST.,"So great the heat, that not a soul could dare"
4359,CANTO THE FIRST.,Approach within ten fathoms of the flare:
4360,CANTO THE FIRST.,And on the rim of this most mystic vase—
4361,CANTO THE FIRST.,"One fathom high—a bluish flame arose,"
4362,CANTO THE FIRST.,Which shed an incense o’er the inner part;
4363,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And warders stood thereon, each with a dart,"
4364,CANTO THE FIRST.,Fierce in their look and ghastly in their mien:
4365,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And farther down a girdle, red and green,"
4366,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Of furious fire, revolved around the shroud"
4367,CANTO THE FIRST.,Which hid the gods[133] from the obsequious crowd:
4368,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And where, within, the arbitrators stay’d"
4369,CANTO THE FIRST.,"For one whole hour, intent upon the dead—"
4370,CANTO THE FIRST.,"As to the burial of the god, and how"
4371,CANTO THE FIRST.,He should be welcom’d in the realms below;—
4372,CANTO THE FIRST.,For ’twas Apollo’s wish that he should be
4373,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Receiv’d with pomp into eternity,"
4374,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And urged the matter to the full extent,"
4375,CANTO THE FIRST.,Till Pluto graciously gave his consent.
4376,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4377,CANTO THE FIRST.,*       *       *       *       *
4378,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4379,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The god,[134] now pleas’d, sent up a yellow shaft—"
4380,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Which Boreas,[135] mighty wind, away did waft"
4381,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Across th’ unfathomable red abyss,—"
4382,CANTO THE FIRST.,And which in transit caused a fearful hiss.
4383,CANTO THE FIRST.,"When Vulcan, seeing, alone, the signal bound,"
4384,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Re-beat his gong,—the vassal host around,"
4385,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Quick as a flash of lightning, then upheld"
4386,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Their polish’d dirks on high, and then re-yell’d!"
4387,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The mighty magistrates, obeying the sound,"
4388,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Inclined their heads, and knelt upon the ground:"
4389,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The while, Apollo (and his mirthful throng)"
4390,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Came forth, repeating the triumphant song—"
4391,CANTO THE FIRST.,"“Hail, Pluto, mighty King!”—around him slung"
4392,CANTO THE FIRST.,"His instrument of joy,—his eye relit"
4393,CANTO THE FIRST.,With his accustom’d dignity and wit.
4394,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Immediately, the cloud collaps’d and fled,"
4395,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And he, the lord of death, appeared glad:"
4396,CANTO THE FIRST.,"He stood erect, and, in the act of pray’r,"
4397,CANTO THE FIRST.,Pour’d forth his orisons into the air:
4398,CANTO THE FIRST.,"His pow’rful speech made all the host afraid,"
4399,CANTO THE FIRST.,And instantly his mandates were obey’d:
4400,CANTO THE FIRST.,"He spoke but once—his chariots were at hand,"
4401,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And round about him his attendants stand,—"
4402,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Each in apparel dazzling to the sight,—"
4403,CANTO THE FIRST.,Their wings outspread in readiness for flight.
4404,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Then Pluto look’d about the torrid space,"
4405,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Stepp’d in his chariot with a kingly grace,"
4406,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And rais’d his beam, full half a ton in weight:"
4407,CANTO THE FIRST.,"When (pointing to his own imperial seat,"
4408,CANTO THE FIRST.,Which stood upon a mount encompass’d round
4409,CANTO THE FIRST.,"By awful chasms and unstable ground,)"
4410,CANTO THE FIRST.,He gave the word—the trumpets shook the vast
4411,CANTO THE FIRST.,With the outpourings of their mighty blast!
4412,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4413,CANTO THE FIRST.,*       *       *       *       *
4414,CANTO THE FIRST.,
4415,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The clouds divided, and the train pass’d through;"
4416,CANTO THE FIRST.,And now the multitude shout out anew—
4417,CANTO THE FIRST.,"“Hail, Pluto, mighty King!” great was the noise."
4418,CANTO THE FIRST.,The quivering earth dissolved into the skies.
4419,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Above, below, around, was void and dark"
4420,CANTO THE FIRST.,"For one whole day, until a vivid spark"
4421,CANTO THE FIRST.,Of crimson flame—in form a serpent’s sting—
4422,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Shot forth towards the mountain of the king,"
4423,CANTO THE FIRST.,"And struck the base of the imperial throne,"
4424,CANTO THE FIRST.,Which shook with awe; and all the earth did groan;
4425,CANTO THE FIRST.,A flash of light lit up the horrid zone;
4426,CANTO THE FIRST.,"The atmosphere ’came full of monster frogs,"
4427,CANTO THE FIRST.,"Of winged porcupines, and howling dogs."

4505,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Her folio, and, with her refulgent shaft,"
4506,CANTO THE SECOND.,Made (as he spake) a brief but careful draft

4510,CANTO THE SECOND.,Declared his acquiescence; and with voice—

4537,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(The faithful goddess, charitable queen,"

4541,CANTO THE SECOND.,Contemplating what ought or might be done
4542,CANTO THE SECOND.,With the cold corpse; whilst her fair lord had gone
4543,CANTO THE SECOND.,Down to the chambers of the mighty god.
4544,CANTO THE SECOND.,He now saluted her with courtly word—
4545,CANTO THE SECOND.,“O Daphne! thou art dear t’Apollo’s heart;

4550,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She ceas’d her tears, but did not cease to mourn:"
4551,CANTO THE SECOND.,Her auburn tresses answered to the breeze
4552,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Which goodly Zephyrus[139] sent by slow degrees,—"
4553,CANTO THE SECOND.,Presuming that her nearly-fainting form
4554,CANTO THE SECOND.,Might be sustain’d and succourèd from harm:
4555,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But ere she’d time to utter forth a sound,"
4556,CANTO THE SECOND.,A mighty rumbling shook the very ground!
4557,CANTO THE SECOND.,They turn’d and saw advancing on the plain
4558,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Meek Libitina, and her sombre train;"
4559,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Then in an instant they were mute and calm,"
4560,CANTO THE SECOND.,Whilst the black host proceeded to embalm

4563,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(The fragrant perfume of the embalming-herbs,"
4564,CANTO THE SECOND.,The death-impregnant atmosphere absorbs:

4567,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The glassy-bumpers ev’n appearèd dull,"
4568,CANTO THE SECOND.,And for awhile their liquors turn’d to gall:
4569,CANTO THE SECOND.,The azure sky was totally obscur’d;
4570,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But Sol himself was not to be immured,—"
4571,CANTO THE SECOND.,"He stay’d, as ’twere within two leagues of Earth,"
4572,CANTO THE SECOND.,And penetrated through the halo-girth
4573,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Intensely red and hot, to mark his love"
4574,CANTO THE SECOND.,"For the fall’n god, the earthly friend of Jove!)"
4575,CANTO THE SECOND.,"This[140] done, the gloomy host returned below"
4576,CANTO THE SECOND.,Unto the palace of the queen of woe;
4577,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Where preparations were going briskly on,"
4578,CANTO THE SECOND.,"To bury Bacchus at to-morrow’s sun,—"
4579,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The going-down thereof, she thought the proper course"

4583,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Their last respects unto the lifeless clod,"
4584,CANTO THE SECOND.,"In form of man, now lying upon the sod,—"
4585,CANTO THE SECOND.,"“And Daphne!” said the nymph, “to watch alone"
4586,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(Save the companionship of the pale moon),"
4587,CANTO THE SECOND.,Throughout those dreary hours without a soul? * * *
4588,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Oh, stay, my love, and o’er me have control.”"
4589,CANTO THE SECOND.,"This, said to Apollo, fired his sapient brain:"
4590,CANTO THE SECOND.,His love for Daphne nought could now restrain!
4591,CANTO THE SECOND.,(So “in the midst of life we are in death;”
4592,CANTO THE SECOND.,And “all is vanity” the preacher saith.)—
4593,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Apollo stay’d, and slept upon the field,"
4594,CANTO THE SECOND.,And nursed his love as mothers nurse a child.
4595,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Now, Leo’s nights were short, so day came on;"
4596,CANTO THE SECOND.,Aurora[141] blush’d to see the beauteous moon:
4597,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But she[142]—the virtuous angel of the night,"
4598,CANTO THE SECOND.,Succumb’d; and thus withdrew her silvery light.
4599,CANTO THE SECOND.,Prodigious Sol then soared into the main;
4600,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And with him soared Apollo’s tuneful strain,—"
4601,CANTO THE SECOND.,"His prayer in song—so pithy and so sweet,"
4602,CANTO THE SECOND.,Ne’er fail’d t’imprint its influence on the great
4603,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Celestial magnates, nobles of the air."
4604,CANTO THE SECOND.,But Bacchus’ death nigh drove them to despair!
4605,CANTO THE SECOND.,"They knew not that the god was lying dead,"
4606,CANTO THE SECOND.,Until Apollo (not in vain) had pray’d
4607,CANTO THE SECOND.,For them to come and join the ritual:
4608,CANTO THE SECOND.,Nor for a moment did they deign t’recall
4609,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The disappointment when they all went down,"
4610,CANTO THE SECOND.,"To Bacchus’ cry, and found the god was gone:"
4611,CANTO THE SECOND.,"They sought for no excuse, but came at once—"
4612,CANTO THE SECOND.,Garb’d in their glory—through the vast expanse
4613,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of heav’n, and ’lighted on the plain, whereat"
4614,CANTO THE SECOND.,The great musician and fair Daphne sat.
4615,CANTO THE SECOND.,"First, Jupiter (Jehovah of the skies,"
4616,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Whose silver hair, in ringlets, reach’d his thighs;"
4617,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And round his waist, most splendid to behold,"
4618,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Were jointed girdles wrought of solid gold,"
4619,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And golden shoes, protectors of his feet,"
4620,CANTO THE SECOND.,Enhanced the splendour of his manly gait:
4621,CANTO THE SECOND.,He grasp’d a sceptre sixteen feet in length;
4622,CANTO THE SECOND.,Himself next to great Hercules in strength:
4623,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Superb in mien, and venerably grand,"
4624,CANTO THE SECOND.,Whose eye no mortal goddess could withstand.)
4625,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Arrived; as he advanced, six feet of ground"
4626,CANTO THE SECOND.,Escaped his tread at each successive bound:
4627,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Twelve feet he stood; his hair fell o’er his brow,"
4628,CANTO THE SECOND.,And from his chin a nevious beard did flow:
4629,CANTO THE SECOND.,Towards the soil his feather’d limbs inclined:
4630,CANTO THE SECOND.,His countenance bespoke a gentle mind:
4631,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(Once the poor god, now dead, implored his aid;"
4632,CANTO THE SECOND.,Who smote the fount and Bacchus’ thirst was stay’d.)
4633,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Seen in the distance, thundering as he came,"
4634,CANTO THE SECOND.,He look’d a god of most uncommon frame!
4635,CANTO THE SECOND.,Poor Daphne shook to see his wondrous form:
4636,CANTO THE SECOND.,Her noble blood began to mingle warm;
4637,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But pale and circumspect she did remain,"
4638,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Impress’d with awe, her eyes straight to the plain"
4639,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Upon th’ incumbent god,—whose time was come"
4640,CANTO THE SECOND.,To be removed into the dismal tomb.
4641,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Next to great Jupiter, came Mercury,—"
4642,CANTO THE SECOND.,"His flesh as smooth and white as ivory,—"
4643,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Though not so tall, as handsome as the one"
4644,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Already there, and sadly looking on;"
4645,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Yet Mercury is both great in stature, and"
4646,CANTO THE SECOND.,Appear’d a lord possessed of much command
4647,CANTO THE SECOND.,In the ethereal mansions; nay—in speech
4648,CANTO THE SECOND.,So eloquent—no other gods could match.
4649,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Then came his majesty the monarch Mars,"
4650,CANTO THE SECOND.,In crimson robes inwoved with diamond stars;
4651,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Robust and hale the god of war appear’d,"
4652,CANTO THE SECOND.,With azure eyes; with saffron colour’d beard:
4653,CANTO THE SECOND.,"In fight, no other god could dare offend;"
4654,CANTO THE SECOND.,And seldom did the monarch condescend
4655,CANTO THE SECOND.,"To make acquaintanceship with others, for"
4656,CANTO THE SECOND.,He proudly thought himself superior;
4657,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Yet he, in token of his great regard"
4658,CANTO THE SECOND.,"For him who lay upon the bruised sward,"
4659,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Threw off his mask of pride, and came below:"
4660,CANTO THE SECOND.,"With him he brought his unstrung golden bow,"
4661,CANTO THE SECOND.,To mark his rank and office in the skies;
4662,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But here he stoop’d, and stooping yielded sighs,—"
4663,CANTO THE SECOND.,Griev’d to the heart to see poor Bacchus so:—
4664,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Him once so warm, but now as cold as snow."
4665,CANTO THE SECOND.,"That other belted god, mysterious being,"
4666,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Saturnus came, and stood fourth in the ring"
4667,CANTO THE SECOND.,Which now began to encompass Bacchus round;
4668,CANTO THE SECOND.,"His hair jet-black, his aspect most profound:"
4669,CANTO THE SECOND.,"A purple garb hung loose around his loins,"
4670,CANTO THE SECOND.,To which his badge of honour meetly joins;
4671,CANTO THE SECOND.,"His eagle eyes were now bedimm’d with tears,—"
4672,CANTO THE SECOND.,He mourn’d for him he’d known a thousand years;
4673,CANTO THE SECOND.,And more than once his sighs were loud indeed:
4674,CANTO THE SECOND.,In his sad countenance the heart could read
4675,CANTO THE SECOND.,Th’ amount of sorrow his grave breast contained;
4676,CANTO THE SECOND.,His strength of mind increasing tears restrained;
4677,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And to denote his senatorial rights,"
4678,CANTO THE SECOND.,Brought down with him his seven satellites:
4679,CANTO THE SECOND.,"He, punctual as to time, was at his post,—"
4680,CANTO THE SECOND.,"There murm’ring forth “O Bacchus, Bacchus, lost”"
4681,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The Georgian Planet, stripling[143] of the air,"
4682,CANTO THE SECOND.,In grand habiliments forth did repair
4683,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Unto the scene of grief; not over tall,"
4684,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Yet bore the image of his master, Sol;"
4685,CANTO THE SECOND.,"He saw the corpse, and plainly did foreshow"
4686,CANTO THE SECOND.,(Though stratagem allowed no tears to flow)
4687,CANTO THE SECOND.,His feelings at the sight of death; but he—
4688,CANTO THE SECOND.,Child of the skies—bore up courageously:
4689,CANTO THE SECOND.,"He (with his satellites—six beauteous lads,"
4690,CANTO THE SECOND.,Esteemèd much among the greatest gods—
4691,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Attending in their robes of lightish-blue,"
4692,CANTO THE SECOND.,"’Terwoven with fine gimp of golden hue),"
4693,CANTO THE SECOND.,Attract’d the grave attention of old Mars;
4694,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Who hail’d him as the “Herschel of the Stars,”—"
4695,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And beckon’d him t’advance, and kiss’d his hand:"
4696,CANTO THE SECOND.,The stripling blushed; he could not understand
4697,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Why, or wherefore, such favour should be shown"
4698,CANTO THE SECOND.,To one so young by one so olden grown;
4699,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Yet felt much pleasure on being recognis’d,"
4700,CANTO THE SECOND.,Whilst more superior gods (as though despis’d)
4701,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Array’d in gorgeous dress, of greater growth,"
4702,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And, in his estimation, greater worth,—"
4703,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Stood silently and mournfully around,"
4704,CANTO THE SECOND.,Intent upon the death-inclosure mound.
4705,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Earth,[144] most profound, in her unfeigned grief—"
4706,CANTO THE SECOND.,Smote her bare breast; her speech was very brief;
4707,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She felt a pressure on her noble heart,"
4708,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But in the rite she took an ample part,—"
4709,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Survey’d the gulf down which the corpse would pass,"
4710,CANTO THE SECOND.,And lined its edges with resplendent moss:
4711,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Most modest, and most generous soul,"
4712,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She’d oft contributed to Bacchus’ bowl,—"
4713,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Prolong’d his life in most abundant ease,"
4714,CANTO THE SECOND.,Until decrepitude besought release;
4715,CANTO THE SECOND.,And still regarded him as one of those
4716,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Whom she, herself, could least afford to lose:"
4717,CANTO THE SECOND.,“But he is gone! and with his corpse a tear
4718,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Shall stray,” said she, “upon the sinking bier;"
4719,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And when regenerated he shall rise,"
4720,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Earth shall be first, for joy, to dim her eyes.”"
4721,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Revolving Venus, Empress of the globes,"
4722,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Extremely beautiful, in purple robes,"
4723,CANTO THE SECOND.,Came now majestically o’er the sward;
4724,CANTO THE SECOND.,"In rev’rence to the dead, spoke not a word:"
4725,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Though, in her joy, her voice was like a lute,"
4726,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She wept in silence, and remainèd mute:"
4727,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Her rosy crown with jew’ls shone like the Sun,"
4728,CANTO THE SECOND.,And tipp’d her tear-drops as they trickled down:
4729,CANTO THE SECOND.,"On either side a Cupid, doubly fair,"
4730,CANTO THE SECOND.,Bore up the tresses of her golden hair;
4731,CANTO THE SECOND.,The Graces guarded her upon the plain;
4732,CANTO THE SECOND.,And fair Adonis held her diamond train:
4733,CANTO THE SECOND.,Her shell-shaped chariot (rearward on the field)
4734,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of ivory wrought, no eye had e’er beheld"
4735,CANTO THE SECOND.,"More beautiful or more enchanting beams,"
4736,CANTO THE SECOND.,Carved in one solid mass—devoid of seams.
4737,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Behold Diana, goddess of the chase;"
4738,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Mark well her features, and her lovely face!"
4739,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She, with dear Venus, set the world on fire"
4740,CANTO THE SECOND.,"With love and beauty, which induced satire:"
4741,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Fair daughter of great Jupiter, she stood—"
4742,CANTO THE SECOND.,Eyes fix’d upon the ground—in pensive mood;
4743,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Her bow, her quiver, deer-skin on her breast,"
4744,CANTO THE SECOND.,Distinctly pointed her from out the rest.
4745,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Poor Actæon (youth, most skilful with the bow—"
4746,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Whose eyes betray’d him, and led on to woe)"
4747,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Beheld, by chance, the goddess in the lake;"
4748,CANTO THE SECOND.,Dreamt not his own existence was at stake;
4749,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But in an instant Fate, with double wrath,"
4750,CANTO THE SECOND.,Transform’d into a stag th’ incautious youth;
4751,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And there, upon the bank, before her face—"
4752,CANTO THE SECOND.,His end was wrought by his own dogs of chase.
4753,CANTO THE SECOND.,(To contemplate his end we stand aghast;
4754,CANTO THE SECOND.,For dire indeed was the poor stripling’s last!)
4755,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Among the other goddesses and nymphs,"
4756,CANTO THE SECOND.,"We scan the circle, and at once we glimpse"
4757,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Good Agenora, most industrious child,"
4758,CANTO THE SECOND.,Laborious maiden on the barren wild;
4759,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Who toil’d for ages, and (’twas not in vain)"
4760,CANTO THE SECOND.,Made a vast wilderness bear lovely grain:
4761,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She by Diana stood, meek, yet sedate,"
4762,CANTO THE SECOND.,And trespass’d not beyond her own estate.
4763,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Aurora, lovely nymph with wings outspread,"
4764,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Having heard with sorrow that the god was dead,"
4765,CANTO THE SECOND.,Came like a cloud across the purple field;
4766,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And, as she swept along the air, did gild"
4767,CANTO THE SECOND.,With the reflection of her crimson folds
4768,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Hills, valleys, mountains, plains, and gorsèd wolds."
4769,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(O lovely nymph! more lovely in the morn,"
4770,CANTO THE SECOND.,When o’er the heav’ns thy radiancy is borne;
4771,CANTO THE SECOND.,"When thou, with magic touch, the gates unbar,"
4772,CANTO THE SECOND.,And bid to rest that struggling little star—
4773,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Last in the field of night, which fain would stay"
4774,CANTO THE SECOND.,To see the beauties of th’ advancing day
4775,CANTO THE SECOND.,But weak in its endeavours to withstand
4776,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The saffron firmament, holds forth its hand"
4777,CANTO THE SECOND.,To shield its face from the bedimming flood;
4778,CANTO THE SECOND.,And in its turn forsakes the neighbourhood
4779,CANTO THE SECOND.,Of heaven.) And now she ’lights among the gods:
4780,CANTO THE SECOND.,"To every one she, sweet enchantress, nods;"
4781,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And, calmly drawing her gorgeous mantle round,"
4782,CANTO THE SECOND.,Pores o’er the lifeless body on the ground.
4783,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Four other goddesses, for virtue famed,"
4784,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Who, for their sweet demeanour, should be named:"
4785,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Minerva, Astrea, and Concordia, three;"
4786,CANTO THE SECOND.,"First, for her wisdom and sagacity;"
4787,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The second, for her justice much renown’d;"
4788,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And next, the third, for peace and concord found;"
4789,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The fourth, for loveliness, Hygeia stands,—"
4790,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Health in her face, and garlands in her hands."
4791,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Omphale, nymph beloved by Hercules;"
4792,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And Hero, “beauteous woman,” came from Thrace."
4793,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Besides all these, there came Historia forth:"
4794,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Fair Ceres,[145] benefactress of the Earth:"
4795,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Lubentia, cheerful goddess, draped her face,"
4796,CANTO THE SECOND.,And came with all her charms veil’d o’er with lace:
4797,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Fair Flora, graceful child, herself a flower,"
4798,CANTO THE SECOND.,Brought all the beauties from her fairy bower:
4799,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Pure Febrüa, who never once did feign"
4800,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Her love to any, joined the mournful train."
4801,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Now came high Juno, lovely queen of heaven,"
4802,CANTO THE SECOND.,August in form; by whom were peacocks driven
4803,CANTO THE SECOND.,Through the blue path which led unto the scene;
4804,CANTO THE SECOND.,Her crown and sceptre graced her noble mien;
4805,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She, mother of great Mars, and Vulcan, too,"
4806,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Bedoff’d her smiles, as solemnly she drew"
4807,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Unto the place where stood the sorrowing nymphs,"
4808,CANTO THE SECOND.,And sigh’d whilst on the corpse she cast a glimpse.
4809,CANTO THE SECOND.,In the first rank the famed Cybele was;
4810,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(The spouse of Saturn, who gain’d such applause"
4811,CANTO THE SECOND.,"For all his exploits in the heavenly space,—"
4812,CANTO THE SECOND.,Described before with those of equal race;)—
4813,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She, as fair Vesta, is the bounteous globe;[146]"
4814,CANTO THE SECOND.,And came arrayed in spring’s delightful robe:
4815,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Her crown of towers pointed to the skies,"
4816,CANTO THE SECOND.,Which proved a landmark for a thousand eyes:
4817,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of many flow’rs her vestment bore the print,"
4818,CANTO THE SECOND.,And charmed the eye with their impressive tint;
4819,CANTO THE SECOND.,"With her great key spring’s treasures she lets loose,"
4820,CANTO THE SECOND.,And with a generous hand deals them profuse’.
4821,CANTO THE SECOND.,"These[147] formed the host of mourners that were bidden,"
4822,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Beneath the cloudless concave of great heaven,"
4823,CANTO THE SECOND.,To bear their witness to the last remains
4824,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of him, who now was past all mortal pains."
4825,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(Though not a cloud that day[148] was ever seen,"
4826,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Sol wore a halo, and look’d very dim,—"
4827,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The only way the god could mark his love,"
4828,CANTO THE SECOND.,"As through the heavens he slowly seem’d to move,"
4829,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Towards the one who’d revelled in his ray,"
4830,CANTO THE SECOND.,And welcomed him at each successive day.)
4831,CANTO THE SECOND.,But now the hour was fast approaching when
4832,CANTO THE SECOND.,They expected forth the sad and sombre train:
4833,CANTO THE SECOND.,"There stood Apollo, foremost on the plain,"
4834,CANTO THE SECOND.,"To watch with his bewitching eyes, the vast"
4835,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Terrestrial space. At length he heard a blast,"
4836,CANTO THE SECOND.,Which Boreas bore towards th’ assembled throng;
4837,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And furthermore, he heard the mournful song,"
4838,CANTO THE SECOND.,As they advanc’d upon the wings of woe:
4839,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(’Round and about the corpse tears freely flow,"
4840,CANTO THE SECOND.,"For gods and goddesses, resplendent clad,"
4841,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Turn’d deathly pale, and certainly look’d sad:)"
4842,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Swift as the winds would bear them, on they came;"
4843,CANTO THE SECOND.,In front a herald to proclaim the name
4844,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of the deceasèd god. “Behold,” he said,"
4845,CANTO THE SECOND.,"“This body here upon the field now laid,"
4846,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Is that of Bacchus, the great god of wine,"
4847,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Who till’d the ground, and rear’d the lovely vine;"
4848,CANTO THE SECOND.,The great dictator of the heathen laws:
4849,CANTO THE SECOND.,His numerous talents gain’d him much applause:
4850,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Wise, though lascivious, he to powèr grew;"
4851,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Was surnam’d Bassareus, and Iacchus, too:"
4852,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Built many cities, and won victories:"
4853,CANTO THE SECOND.,The benefactor of societies:
4854,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Son of great Jupiter,—Semele’s child,—"
4855,CANTO THE SECOND.,"On whom, in early life, Silenus smil’d;"
4856,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And whom the nymphs embraced with filial love,"
4857,CANTO THE SECOND.,Through which they gain’d their access unto Jove:
4858,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Phœnicia’s King,—his wisdom he unfurl’d;"
4859,CANTO THE SECOND.,"His subjects taught to navigate the world,"
4860,CANTO THE SECOND.,For which—and other exploits—thus shall he
4861,CANTO THE SECOND.,Be grandly welcom’d to Eternity:”—
4862,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And then he blew his trumpet, call’d aloud—"
4863,CANTO THE SECOND.,"“Bear witness to the deed, ye assembled crowd,"
4864,CANTO THE SECOND.,Whilst I the fallen god’s remains enshroud.”
4865,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Then, as they alight upon th’ adjacent ground,"
4866,CANTO THE SECOND.,Five hundred horse sent forth a trampling sound;
4867,CANTO THE SECOND.,And mighty Hercules was in the rear
4868,CANTO THE SECOND.,(For not another god could bear the gear)—
4869,CANTO THE SECOND.,"High in the air, upon the funeral car,"
4870,CANTO THE SECOND.,His helmet shining like a glorious star:
4871,CANTO THE SECOND.,From his great beam a scream resound the skies
4872,CANTO THE SECOND.,As they progress—swift as an eagle flies.
4873,CANTO THE SECOND.,"With him came Mors, who gave two heavy sighs;"
4874,CANTO THE SECOND.,"A hundred deaths she had attended to,"
4875,CANTO THE SECOND.,But never one like this—so fraught with woe!
4876,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Her vesture hanging in loose folds of black,"
4877,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Her hair all straighten’d o’er her graceful back,"
4878,CANTO THE SECOND.,Betokened grief; she ne’er conceived to crave
4879,CANTO THE SECOND.,Poor Bacchus for the dread and dismal grave:
4880,CANTO THE SECOND.,"No, no, ’twas he himself,—his great excess,"
4881,CANTO THE SECOND.,That brought upon the earth such dire distress:
4882,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Yea, had he been a little circumspect,"
4883,CANTO THE SECOND.,Another thousand years his brow may’ve deck’d;
4884,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But his lascivious habits, silly god,"
4885,CANTO THE SECOND.,Brought him thus soon to grace the viny sod.
4886,CANTO THE SECOND.,
4887,CANTO THE SECOND.,*       *       *       *       *
4888,CANTO THE SECOND.,
4889,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Now to the grave!—a gulf six fathoms wide,"
4890,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Six in its length, and straight on every side;"
4891,CANTO THE SECOND.,Down which no eye doth dare to penetrate;
4892,CANTO THE SECOND.,For to the realm of sighs this was the gate:
4893,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Four cedar beams, exactly wrought to shape,"
4894,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Lie, near each brink, across the dreadful gap;"
4895,CANTO THE SECOND.,Four other beams of equal size extend
4896,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Towards the heav’ns, and centre in one end;"
4897,CANTO THE SECOND.,"To which a chain, wrought out of Ætna’s fire,"
4898,CANTO THE SECOND.,Pass’d through an aperture a cubit higher
4899,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(Its length ten leagues, and polish’d every link);"
4900,CANTO THE SECOND.,"One end in hell, and one upon the brink,"
4901,CANTO THE SECOND.,Upon the side whereat the funeral train
4902,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Would yield the corpse; there, on the sacred plain,"
4903,CANTO THE SECOND.,"To be uplifted, and then gently swung"
4904,CANTO THE SECOND.,O’er the abyss! Hark to the obit’s song!
4905,CANTO THE SECOND.,"As on the sad procession wend their way,"
4906,CANTO THE SECOND.,"In funeral paces, at the wane of day:"
4907,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The sound increases as they, slower still—"
4908,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Far on the plain, come o’er a gradual hill,"
4909,CANTO THE SECOND.,On which an arch built up with lovely pines—
4910,CANTO THE SECOND.,Entwined with olives and selected vines—
4911,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Bore on its top a crimson flame, which ’rose"
4912,CANTO THE SECOND.,To light the cortége as it onward goes;
4913,CANTO THE SECOND.,For now the sun was sinking fast below
4914,CANTO THE SECOND.,The dark horizon of the western brow.
4915,CANTO THE SECOND.,’Tis now indeed a melancholy hour;
4916,CANTO THE SECOND.,"For, as they line the brink, they hear the roar—"
4917,CANTO THE SECOND.,The thunder of great Vulcan’s mighty gong:
4918,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Besides, they hear, though faint, th’ Infernals’ song"
4919,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of joy; and there, as round the vault they stand,"
4920,CANTO THE SECOND.,Is heard the clamour of th’ uproarious band
4921,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Let loose below, to revel at their will,"
4922,CANTO THE SECOND.,Till Mulciber shall bid them to be still.
4923,CANTO THE SECOND.,Then suddenly up shot into the air
4924,CANTO THE SECOND.,From out the gulf a stream of yellow flare;
4925,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And then a sulph’rous cloud involved the pit,"
4926,CANTO THE SECOND.,"In which a thousand infant demons flit,"
4927,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Most wretched to behold; but joy for them,"
4928,CANTO THE SECOND.,And all the spirits who were waiting him—
4929,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The dead! Now griev’d Apollo, standing near,"
4930,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Waved his white rod (but waved it with a tear),"
4931,CANTO THE SECOND.,The signal to uplift the ponderous bier
4932,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Above the gulf. Below, a sound arose,"
4933,CANTO THE SECOND.,As round the giant-axle slowly moves;
4934,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Contracting, every turn, the clinking chain,"
4935,CANTO THE SECOND.,Which lifted Bacchus from the purple plain.
4936,CANTO THE SECOND.,
4937,CANTO THE SECOND.,*       *       *       *       *
4938,CANTO THE SECOND.,
4939,CANTO THE SECOND.,When (as the body swung into the cloud)
4940,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Apollo struck his harp, the noble crowd"
4941,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of gods and goddesses their tabours rung,"
4942,CANTO THE SECOND.,And peal’d the requiem in most glorious song!
4943,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Said Hercules, who almost long’d to die—"
4944,CANTO THE SECOND.,When first the anthem broke into the sky—
4945,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(The corpse was then descending the abyss,)"
4946,CANTO THE SECOND.,"“Oh, give me death, and bury me like this!”"
4947,CANTO THE SECOND.,"He doff’d his helmet (noble was his brow),"
4948,CANTO THE SECOND.,And as a child the hero seemèd now;
4949,CANTO THE SECOND.,For while he listen’d to th’ harmonious flow
4950,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of sound, unmatch’d on earth, his heart did leap."
4951,CANTO THE SECOND.,And Pan was there with his melodious pipe;
4952,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Who—god of woods, of shepherds, most divine—"
4953,CANTO THE SECOND.,"On this occasion made his genius shine,—"
4954,CANTO THE SECOND.,"His reed he blew with such delightful force,"
4955,CANTO THE SECOND.,"That Hercules rejoic’d, so did his horse."
4956,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Apollo’s nine companions[149] there with him,"
4957,CANTO THE SECOND.,Enhanced the grandeur of the mournful hymn:
4958,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Fair Terpsichore look’d sad, but sang most sweet,"
4959,CANTO THE SECOND.,And timed most gracefully the poet’s feet:
4960,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Euterpe, too, th’ inventor of the flute,"
4961,CANTO THE SECOND.,Was only rivall’d by fair Clio’s lute:
4962,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And Calliope’s sweet enchanting voice,"
4963,CANTO THE SECOND.,Made heart and soul and flesh rejoice:
4964,CANTO THE SECOND.,"The songs of Polyhymnia were so dealt,"
4965,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Gods, great and small, turn’d gravely as they knelt"
4966,CANTO THE SECOND.,To see from whence the melody arose:
4967,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She heeded not,—and on her singing goes"
4968,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Till e’en the ground beneath them, where they stood,"
4969,CANTO THE SECOND.,Seem’d to give ear: and Mars was much subdued.
4970,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Erato, Thalia, blest Urania, and"
4971,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Melpŏmene the grave, complete the band,"
4972,CANTO THE SECOND.,Who came from far their tuneful aid to lend;
4973,CANTO THE SECOND.,And with their songs their prayers for Bacchus send
4974,CANTO THE SECOND.,"To Him, the Sovereign of continual death,"
4975,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of woe, of mis’ry, and eternal wrath!"
4976,CANTO THE SECOND.,
4977,CANTO THE SECOND.,*       *       *       *       *
4978,CANTO THE SECOND.,
4979,CANTO THE SECOND.,For one whole hour the requiem did not cease;
4980,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Its words, interpreted, were writ as these—"
4981,CANTO THE SECOND.,"“O mighty king! O Pluto, lord of hell!"
4982,CANTO THE SECOND.,Extend thy grace to his departed soul:
4983,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Receive his corpse, and furnish it with breath,"
4984,CANTO THE SECOND.,That he may revel in the realms of death:—
4985,CANTO THE SECOND.,So that our loss may be thy kingdom’s gain.”
4986,CANTO THE SECOND.,A pause ensued: and then a dreadful cry
4987,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Came up the grave, which rent the gloomy sky."
4988,CANTO THE SECOND.,With it arose a wave of crimson flame
4989,CANTO THE SECOND.,Up straight towards a cloud that cover’d them;
4990,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Which shaped itself into a feather’d beam,"
4991,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And wrote upon the cloud, thus: “Bassareus lives!”"
4992,CANTO THE SECOND.,To their wits’ end the gods and goddesses
4993,CANTO THE SECOND.,Were driv’n: they scan the cloud and there behold
4994,CANTO THE SECOND.,The marv’lous scrip in letters of bright gold:
4995,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Anon they gazed, until it vanishèd,"
4996,CANTO THE SECOND.,And gods conferr’d like men astonishèd.
4997,CANTO THE SECOND.,They now resolved to wend their way from earth;
4998,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Some East, some West, some South, and others North:"
4999,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Their minds, indeed, impressed with mighty things;"
5000,CANTO THE SECOND.,Such as did baffle all their reasonings.
5001,CANTO THE SECOND.,"As Hercules flew swiftly to the East,"
5002,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Apollo and fair Daphne to the West,"
5003,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Straight from the North great Boreas swept the plain,"
5004,CANTO THE SECOND.,And bore a portion of the mystic train
5005,CANTO THE SECOND.,"To the south region of the mournful height,"
5006,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(For not a star had deign’d to shine that night,)—"
5007,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Yea, all was dark. Earth, Air, and Ocean, now"
5008,CANTO THE SECOND.,Were void. Not so in the dread realms below:—
5009,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Where there were spirits—tens of thousands, fiends,"
5010,CANTO THE SECOND.,Whose shrieks were borne upon the various winds
5011,CANTO THE SECOND.,Of hell; and who with awful vengeance swore
5012,CANTO THE SECOND.,"That such should be for ever, evermore!"
5013,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Where mountains labour in the trough of woe,"
5014,CANTO THE SECOND.,And topple over on the host below:
5015,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Where valleys lift themselves, and roll in waves:"
5016,CANTO THE SECOND.,Where grim idolaters rise from their graves
5017,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And walk the plains like skeletons of death,"
5018,CANTO THE SECOND.,Imparting oaths at each receding breath;
5019,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Whose tongues hang down upon their fleshless breasts,"
5020,CANTO THE SECOND.,And waste their foam like over-burthen’d beasts.
5021,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But there were, also, those grandees of state;"
5022,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And in their midst that mighty Autocrat,"
5023,CANTO THE SECOND.,The Governor of all therein; and he
5024,CANTO THE SECOND.,Unbarr’d the gate of immortality:
5025,CANTO THE SECOND.,"While Vulcan, in attendance on the god,"
5026,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Had watch’d his master, and observed his nod:"
5027,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Towards the corpse he went, and breathed one breath,—"
5028,CANTO THE SECOND.,"When Bacchus ’rose, and doff’d his robe of death!"
5029,CANTO THE SECOND.,
5030,CANTO THE SECOND.,*       *       *       *       *
5031,CANTO THE SECOND.,
5032,CANTO THE SECOND.,This was the moment when upwent that cry
5033,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Which, as ’twas said, had rent the gloomy sky:"
5034,CANTO THE SECOND.,This was the moment that the fiery waves
5035,CANTO THE SECOND.,Wrote on the cloud above them—“Bassareus lives!”
5036,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And this the hour that Earth, and Air, and Sea,"
5037,CANTO THE SECOND.,Was one vast waste of transient misery!
5038,CANTO THE SECOND.,When all the gods and goddesses were thrown
5039,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Into a state of tremulous concern,"
5040,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And took themselves to flight, each one their way,"
5041,CANTO THE SECOND.,To write their records of the dismal day.
5042,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Now, Proserpine,[150] she, Pluto’s august queen,"
5043,CANTO THE SECOND.,Was present to augment the novel scene:
5044,CANTO THE SECOND.,"(No goddess, Pluto—though his power was great—"
5045,CANTO THE SECOND.,Could e’er induce to share his vast estate;
5046,CANTO THE SECOND.,"He, vex’d, enraged, deformed, despised, went forth,"
5047,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Stole Proserpine, and sunk into the earth;"
5048,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Which deed, great consternation then provoked"
5049,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Among the Virgins, where he ’rose: they look’d,"
5050,CANTO THE SECOND.,"But ’twas in vain, for suddenly they’d gone"
5051,CANTO THE SECOND.,Down to the caverns of the mighty one.)
5052,CANTO THE SECOND.,"She saw poor Bassareus lift his ruffled head,—"
5053,CANTO THE SECOND.,Observ’d his deathied checks flush to a red:
5054,CANTO THE SECOND.,"And saw his eyes revolve, as ’round he gazed"
5055,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Upon the crowd, and stood—as though amazed—"
5056,CANTO THE SECOND.,Contemplating with evident deep thought
5057,CANTO THE SECOND.,The strange transfiguration which was wrought.
5058,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Forth Pluto stepp’d, and, holding out his hand,"
5059,CANTO THE SECOND.,Embraced the god. * * * The then surrounding band
5060,CANTO THE SECOND.,"Of wondering magnates, vie[151] and send abroad—"
5061,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”
5062,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Then all the multitude join’d in the song,"
5063,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And ceasèd not, till Vulcan beat his gong;"
5064,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,When to the palace the great concourse went;
5065,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And on the mount, where dwelt th’ omnipotent"
5066,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Unmerciful, great god, to light the way"
5067,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Ten thousand torches flamed towards the sky;
5068,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And all within, and out, was revelry."
5069,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Uninterruptedly, for nine whole days"
5070,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,The carnival endured: a fervent blaze—
5071,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Meanwhile continuing—cast a melting heat
5072,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Upon the host assembled round the seat
5073,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Of Pluto. But poor Bacchus grew afraid,[152]—"
5074,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,He being an alien in the land of dread:
5075,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"When first he saw the gloomy element,"
5076,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"His heart forsook him, and much tears he spent;"
5077,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"When first he heard the thunderings of hell,"
5078,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"He beat his breast, and cursed his living soul;"
5079,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"When he beheld the fiends fly ’cross the course,"
5080,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"He stamp’d the ground, and grumbled with remorse;"
5081,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"When at a furnace-heat the winds did blow,"
5082,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"More sad, dejected, did poor Bassareus grow;—"
5083,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"His anguish now became so great, he foamed,"
5084,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Inclined his head towards the ground, and moaned:"
5085,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Now raved aloud for that he loved on Earth,"
5086,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,To cool his tongue and wash his frothy mouth:
5087,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Then shook his head, and swung it like a plumb,"
5088,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Reviling bitterly his mother’s womb:
5089,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Discomfited, he sent a piteous cry * * *"
5090,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,(Which all the host interpreted for joy.)
5091,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And roar’d aloud—“Ye gods of hell, be damn’d”"
5092,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,(The more he cried less did they understand.)
5093,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Upon his ears their hideous chorus dwelt;
5094,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,And as the direful strain of discords swell’d
5095,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"He roll’d himself upon the heated earth,"
5096,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,(They misconstrued it into signs of mirth;)
5097,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Then bit his flesh, and pluck’d his bearded chin;"
5098,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Besought the gods to disembowel him!
5099,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,(But more and more the tumult did increase:
5100,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Awhile he swore—they sent into the space
5101,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Their boisterous shouts in honour of their king,"
5102,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,And unto Bacchus tuned their welcoming.)
5103,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Yes—he, poor god, grew more and more depress’d;"
5104,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"His temples swoll’n, and every joint oppress’d"
5105,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"With pain intense, he cried—“None so distress’d"

5107,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Not one so miserable was ever born!”

5109,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Great Pluto, seeing the god most sorely wroth,"
5110,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"(For on his bearded chin there lurk’d the froth,)"
5111,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Said unto him—“O Bassareus! why so sad?
5112,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Pray doff thy sorrow, and uplift thine head,—"
5113,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Behold the grandeur of my Palestine:
5114,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"On yonder mountain, next in rank to mine,"
5115,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And in the clouds, a castle I will raise,—"
5116,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"In which (my will is) thou shalt pass thy days,"
5117,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And there remain, till Jupiter shall call,"
5118,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Shall call thee hence unto the world of Sol!”
5119,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"(These words electrified the mournful god,"
5120,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Who rubbed his eyes, and scann’d the multitude.)"
5121,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Continued Pluto: “Thine the fault shall be,"
5122,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,If thou dost not enjoy felicity:—
5123,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,For in thy mansion vassals thou shalt have;
5124,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"A guard of honour, powerful and brave,"
5125,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Shall be, Friend Bassareus, at thy own command;"
5126,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And in my senate thou, at my right hand,"
5127,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Shall hold the sceptre of unrighteousness;
5128,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Thy chief attendants shall be Lachesis,"
5129,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And Clotho, and their sister Atropos;[153]"
5130,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Those noted creatures of fatality:

5132,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Megæra, Alecto, and Tisiphone,[154]"
5133,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Endowed with gifts most suitable to thee:

5135,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"My orders shall go forth to Mulciber,"
5136,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"To forge a chariot of Corinthian brass,"
5137,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Of great dimensions, that thou mightest pass"
5138,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,About the regions of thy residence

5144,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And grew, dissemblingly, more reconciled,"
5145,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,He clench’d his hands and ’rose a cubit higher
5146,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"(Red as the elements that raged with fire),"
5147,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,And turned his sweating face towards the sky:
5148,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Unheeding the vast crowd’s tumultuous cry,"
5149,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"His lips, with much emotion, seemed to move:"
5150,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"At last he thunder’d out this prayer to Jove,—"

5154,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Sustain me, Jove, in my adversity! * * *"
5155,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,My flesh is melting with the dreadful blaze
5156,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Revolving round the vast infernal space:
5157,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,My hunger and my thirst’s unbearable;
5158,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,The noise of hell—most incomparable!—
5159,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"From which, O Jove! with Pluto intercede,"
5160,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,That of these torments Bacchus may be freed:
5161,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"And if ’tis possible, O Jupiter!"
5162,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"With all thy majesty in Earth and Air,"
5163,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Thy wit, thy wisdom, and unrivalled power;"
5164,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Whose eloquence of speech, whose well-earn’d store"
5165,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Of heav’nly honours, none can e’er surpass,—"
5166,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Speak thou to Pluto, that I may repass"
5167,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Through that great gulf, back to those orient plains,"
5168,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,There bask again among those teeming vines;—
5169,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,There——” but as he spake this word[155] (and ’twas his last!)
5170,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Loud thunders clapp’d, and lightnings rent the Vast"
5171,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Tornadoes, furiously the plains career’d;"
5172,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,And all the host of hell aghast appear’d!
5173,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Now Bassareus cried; tears mingled with his sweat:
5174,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"He lash’d his body, and defined a threat,"
5175,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,And coupled with it a most horrid oath;
5176,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Which Pluto could not bear. So, in his wroth,"
5177,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"He turn’d an Enemy; and, with disdain,"
5178,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Commanded all the Elements to rain
5179,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,A torrent of red flame!—Down came the flood!
5180,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"The merc’less fluid, mingled with the blood"
5181,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Of tens of thousands (in an instant slain),"
5182,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Rush’d like an ocean o’er the smoking plain.

5186,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"From his high towers—the deluge, Pluto saw."
5187,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,The dissolution of the host below
5188,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Chang’d not his countenance. A thousand times
5189,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,This haughty monarch (and for lesser crimes
5190,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Than those of Bassareus’) scourged the land with fire,"
5191,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Durst any magnate to provoke his ire.
5192,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Said he to Proserpine—“Lift I my hand,"
5193,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,Ten thousand demons are at my command:

5197,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,No such destruction shall be ever thine;

5199,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,For ever in those glorious realms of hell.
5200,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Nox,[156] ancient creature, shall for ever find"
5201,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"My heart in favour, and my edicts kind:"
5202,“LONG LIVE GREAT BASSAREUS!” “HAIL OUR NEW-BORN GOD!”,"Though dark her ways, her manners I approve,—"

5301,I.,"In yonder vale,—famed for its genial mould,"
5302,I.,"Its pastoral beauties, and rare grains of gold,[159]—"
5303,I.,"There, ’neath the shelter of a peasant’s cot,"
5304,I.,A pair of rosied cheeks was the fair lot
5305,I.,"Of young Jane Hollybrand; who had to toil,"
5306,I.,To cook potatoes; cauliflowers to boil;
5307,I.,To scrub and clean the inside[160] oaken floor;
5308,I.,To watch and feed the chickens at the door;
5309,I.,To see the drowsy pig cried not in vain;
5310,I.,"To cheer in summer-time, or winter’s reign,"
5311,I.,Her loving father. On returning home
5312,I.,"From his day’s work, she’d say:—“Come, father, come.”"
5313,I.,"And, with an angel’s voice, so clear, so sweet—"
5314,I.,"“The supper’s ready, father, take your seat.”"
5315,I.,"Alas! her mother, Death had stol’n away"
5316,I.,Just when ’twas needed most that she should stay
5317,I.,For her child’s good. The poor man’s heart was rent:
5318,I.,The twilight hour was regularly spent
5319,I.,"In reading godly books, wherein he sought"
5320,I.,"The Holy One, for help: then was he taught"
5321,I.,That sacred saying—life is but a span!
5322,I.,"And then he’d sigh, and well he might, poor man."
5323,I.,"Twelve years of sweet conjugal happiness,"
5324,I.,"Had made their little home a paradise,—"
5325,I.,"’Til that grim monster stretch’d his deathy hand,"
5326,I.,And marr’d the pleasures of George Hollybrand.
5327,I.,"Great must, indeed, have been the father’s grief;"
5328,I.,"But gaining faith—through pray’r, he found relief."
5329,I.,He taught his darling with a father’s care
5330,I.,"To spell, to read, to write; to be aware"
5331,I.,"Of certain youths; who, from the village, found,"
5332,I.,Their way unto the cottage-hallow’d ground.

5341,II.,"About this thatch-roof’d dwelling, so remote,"
5342,II.,A blackbird chirped from its tiny throat
5343,II.,Its rural anthem; and for this Jane gave
5344,II.,"The brown-bread crumbs, she’d made a rule to save."
5345,II.,"So came the pretty robin-redbreast, too,—"
5346,II.,"(Oh! that the world was half so good and true,)"
5347,II.,She from the leaded window-sill would pick
5348,II.,With birdlike aptitude—so wondrous quick—
5349,II.,The frugal fragments of Jane’s surplus store;
5350,II.,"Haste to her offspring, and return for more:"
5351,II.,"Sometimes the pretty creature chirp’d in vain,"
5352,II.,But not when Jane could spare a crumb or grain.
5353,II.,"Throughout the months of April, May, and June,"
5354,II.,"Forth came the cuckoo, and chimed out his tune"
5355,II.,Upon the sky-branch of the apple-tree;
5356,II.,"There, unmolested, perch’d he merrily:—"
5357,II.,"O! happy favourite, of the wingèd host,"
5358,II.,Where dost thou dwell—inland? or on the coast?—
5359,II.,"Or in some dreary cave, where all is night,—"
5360,II.,Belike earth’s chaos ere God gave the light?
5361,II.,Say—whither shall imagination trace
5362,II.,Thy magic form; to hear thee chime with grace
5363,II.,Thy rare ding-dong harmonious voice:
5364,II.,"Oh! tell us, tell us, that we may rejoice"
5365,II.,"In thy long absence,—that we may obtain"
5366,II.,A fancied hearing of thy heav’nly strain:
5367,II.,"Ah! thine, indeed, must be a cherub’s throat:"
5368,II.,"Who taught thee singing, blest one? or, by rote,"
5369,II.,"Didst thou, thy pretty self improve the note"
5370,II.,"With such precision, that for miles around"
5371,II.,Attentive list’ners hear thy twofold sound?
5372,II.,"Thou art a sort of majesty in air,"
5373,II.,"Without a crown, without a kingdom’s care:"
5374,II.,When in July thou’st bidden all farewell—
5375,II.,Methinks I hear thee still in yonder vale;
5376,II.,And long the joy to list thy voice again
5377,II.,"When winter’s past, and spring resumes her reign."

5381,III.,
5382,III.,"Now in the spring-time of the coming year,"
5383,III.,When in the south celestial hemisphere
5384,III.,"Proud Horus mounted with increasing strength,"
5385,III.,And each succeeding day had grown in length;—
5386,III.,"When April clouds their vernal drops had shed,"
5387,III.,And bonny May had made all nature glad;—
5388,III.,"When that arch monarch had assail’d the moon,"
5389,III.,And bade her quarter in the month of June;—
5390,III.,"Then in the garden, rearward of the cot,—"
5391,III.,"(A little oblong well-trimm’d fruitful spot,"
5392,III.,"Encompass’d round with hedge-row elder trees,)"
5393,III.,Thenceforth would come the meek harmonious bees;
5394,III.,"There trip from plant to plant, from flow’r to flow’r,"
5395,III.,A-gathering in their luscious golden store.
5396,III.,"Some day, perchance, when Horus waxed warm,"
5397,III.,The honied-host would sally forth and swarm:
5398,III.,Their movements little Jane would watch with care;
5399,III.,"Would call her father, and again repair"
5400,III.,Towards the garden: then she knew full well
5401,III.,"’Twas time to fetch and swing the tinkling bell,"
5402,III.,To save them winging down the orchard-dell.

5409,III.,"Whilst wandering in the silent lovely night,—"
5410,III.,"A living lantern in the darksome hours,"

5416,III.,To lose its turn into eternity[161]—
5417,III.,"To mingle in old Neptune’s revelry,)"
5418,III.,Is oft obscured by Nature’s ambient sward;

5431,IV.,"The squire, himself a rare good-natured gent,"
5432,IV.,"Oft at this dwelling, hours of leisure spent;"
5433,IV.,"Would smoke his pipe, and not refuse to take"

5441,IV.,This frank old Englishman confess’d his pride

5460,V.,"The fair-hair’d stripling proved a welcome guest,"

5462,V.,Which won for him the universal mark
5463,V.,"(From Bishop Butler,[164] to the parish-clerk,)"
5464,V.,"Of friendship—nay, the love of one and all:"
5465,V.,"The village-matrons, all were wont to call"
5466,V.,Him “the young Squire;” and as he pass’d their way
5467,V.,"They’d call their daughters from the washing-tray,"
5468,V.,"Or spinning-wheel, or the old-fashion’d loom,"
5469,V.,"Or in the midst of scrubbing out a room,"
5470,V.,Or at the pigs’ sty—where they were intent

5472,V.,And forth they’d come—some with their naked arms;
5473,V.,"Some with their “wee-uns;” some much skill’d in charms,—"

5508,V.,"The blacksmith, also, at the village forge,"
5509,V.,"(His handy-workman, or his own son George,)"

5579,VII.,He’d ta’en his pleasurable cottage tour:
5580,VII.,"Surprised, indeed, was he to see the youth!"
5581,VII.,"“There’s something wrong,” he said; “come, tell me truth!”"
5582,VII.,"So then the boy drew forth, and ’gan to say—"
5583,VII.,"“Dear aunt is taken ill; but uncle, pray"
5584,VII.,Don’t be alarm’d:” when lo! he ’spied (between
5585,VII.,"The quaint old settle, and a kind of screen,"
5586,VII.,"Which hid a bed,) the lovely cottage queen:"
5587,VII.,"Who, when she saw the gentle youth advance,"
5588,VII.,"Had thither fled, and sought t’avoid his glance:"
5589,VII.,Her dark-blue eyes shone in that sombre light
5590,VII.,Like glow-worms spangling in the depth of night:
5591,VII.,He saw!—he felt a smart impulsive move!—
5592,VII.,And from that hour he sought t’improve his love.
5593,VII.,The old man call’d the “lassie” forth and said
5594,VII.,"“There, Arnold, is she not a pretty maid?—"
5595,VII.,"She has the work of all the house to do,"
5596,VII.,"Yet always clean: come, Arnold, we must go.”"
5597,VII.,The uncle dreamt not that his nephew’s heart
5598,VII.,"Was smitten, wounded with love’s keenest dart:"
5599,VII.,"He little thought it—that henceforth this girl,"
5600,VII.,"Of humble birth, would be so rich a pearl"
5601,VII.,To his “dear boy:” it never cross’d his brain
5602,VII.,The youth so soon would wander there again;
5603,VII.,"And there to press her tiny hand in his,"
5604,VII.,"(The while implanting on her cheek a kiss,)"
5605,VII.,"And leaving in that hand a valued ring,—"
5606,VII.,"That when she saw ’t she might, remembering"
5607,VII.,"Some future day the giver, say—“Ah me!"
5608,VII.,"How oft I’ve thought, and still shall think, of thee!"
5609,VII.,"Thou art a treasure—O, thou beauteous gem!"
5610,VII.,I’ll kiss thee now and think I’m kissing him:
5611,VII.,"Perhaps it’s but a dream, yet shall mine eyes"
5612,VII.,For e’er behold him in this pretty prize.”

5620,VIII.,
5621,VIII.,"Young Mountjoy now was nineteen years of age,"
5622,VIII.,"Susceptible to love, and prone t’engage."
5623,VIII.,"His beauty, (he call’d her) tall inclin’d,"
5624,VIII.,Made such impression on his gentle mind
5625,VIII.,"That he, with whom he went, wherever he stray’d,"
5626,VIII.,Without disguise profess’d he lov’d the maid.
5627,VIII.,"Three times, or more, within the cottage he"
5628,VIII.,"Improved the hour, and with solemnity"
5629,VIII.,Pour’d forth his orisons. (When all alone
5630,VIII.,He often ’d pray’d that Jane might be his own.)
5631,VIII.,Love’s rosy tint flush’d her sweet cheeks and brow
5632,VIII.,"As Jane beheld him, yet she knew not how"
5633,VIII.,Or why he lov’d her so: (but as she grew
5634,VIII.,She heard his voice in every breeze that blew.)
5635,VIII.,"And now he kiss’d her cheek, and wept a tear"
5636,VIII.,To think the hour of parting drew so near:
5637,VIII.,He thought (no doubt) at home there’d be no rest—
5638,VIII.,That dearest Jane would never be their guest;
5639,VIII.,"But still he thought—when many years are flown,"
5640,VIII.,"And I am lord and master of my own,"
5641,VIII.,(Good Heaven willing it) my Jane shall then
5642,VIII.,Be welcom’d mistress at the old domain.

5647,IX.,"When George, returning home from work one day,"
5648,IX.,Saw at a distance by some ricks of hay
5649,IX.,"In the “eight-acre” field, close by the gate,"
5650,IX.,"The well-known die,[171]—he paus’d: “as sure as fate,”"
5651,IX.,"He said, “that’s my dear child!—what can it be?”"
5652,IX.,"And hasten’d forward; when she cheerfully,"
5653,IX.,"Ran forth to meet him, say’ng “dear father look!”"
5654,IX.,At the same time she from her bosom took
5655,IX.,"A tiny parcel, which contain’d the ring;"
5656,IX.,"Unfolding it, and tip-toe whispering—"
5657,IX.,"“For this I gave one little lock of hair,"
5658,IX.,And I must keep it with the greatest care
5659,IX.,"For Arnold’s sake; and, then besides all this,"
5660,IX.,"He gave me such a loving, loving kiss,"
5661,IX.,"And said—‘When far and far away, that he"
5662,IX.,Should kiss that pretty curl and think ’twas me:—
5663,IX.,"The ring,’ he said, ‘was gold—of precious worth,"
5664,IX.,That he had priz’d it more than all the earth!’”
5665,IX.,"George seem’d amaz’d; and speechless for awhile,"
5666,IX.,Sat brooding o’er it[172] on the gateway-stile:
5667,IX.,A thousand things came flitting in his brain:
5668,IX.,"He thought, as thousands would, of her being slain"
5669,IX.,In childhood’s sweet simplicity!
5670,IX.,And pray’d to God to solve the mystery.
5671,IX.,Thus he at once his cause to Heaven resign’d:
5672,IX.,And Heaven as soon consoled his harass’d mind;
5673,IX.,For scarcely were his pray’rs (in silence said)
5674,IX.,"Gone forth on high, (whilst ’round his daughter play’d,)"
5675,IX.,When Jane this brief appeal t’her father made—
5676,IX.,"“Pray tell me, father, why you seem so sad;"
5677,IX.,Oh! was it wrong to take it from the lad?
5678,IX.,"Forgive me, father, if I’ve done amiss:"
5679,IX.,He only press’d my hand and gave a kiss!”
5680,IX.,"Then George was comforted, and sped along,"
5681,IX.,Humming a kind of bass to Janie’s song;
5682,IX.,But still he labour’d on in deep suspense—
5683,IX.,Assur’d of this—that it would give offence
5684,IX.,To all the folks[173] at Westonbury Hall;
5685,IX.,"And thus it proved, for dreadful was the fall.—"
5686,IX.,"Ambitious they were, of rank and name"
5687,IX.,Nought ever shock’d the lady’s tender frame
5688,IX.,So much as this sad news. She found no rest;
5689,IX.,Fell in a violent rage and smote her breast;
5690,IX.,"Flew to her writing-desk, dipp’d pen in ink,"
5691,IX.,(Appear’d as tho’ she thought it sin to think—
5692,IX.,"Ironic’lly exclaiming, ah! ah! ah!)"
5693,IX.,And wrote a lengthy note to Arnold’s “pa.”
5694,IX.,"Her fondest hopes, she said, were frustrated,"
5695,IX.,Which for so many years concentrated
5696,IX.,In him. * * * God never bless’d them with a son;
5697,IX.,"So she, it seems, had calculated on"
5698,IX.,"A son-in-law, in Arnold; but alas!"
5699,IX.,"This hope had fled. (Not like the blade of grass,"
5700,IX.,Which in the summer-time for lack of rain
5701,IX.,"Decays and dies, whilst there comes up again"
5702,IX.,"One equally as rare when clouds recruit,"
5703,IX.,And shed their globulès down to its root.
5704,IX.,"Nor like the corn-crops yellowing in July,"
5705,IX.,"Slain by the reaper ’neath an August sky,"
5706,IX.,"For there again shoots up, of equal worth,"
5707,IX.,Some other esculent to gladden earth.
5708,IX.,No!—Arnold’s living; yet for ever dead;
5709,IX.,"His name is spoken, but with constant dread:"
5710,IX.,"No longer shall he lift the wine-cup there,—"

5726,X.,"Inclined to think it never could be true,"

5987,I.,Transported Arnold o’er the refluent main.
5988,I.,"At home, and safely housed at Rollingate,"
5989,I.,"(Install’d dictator of his own estate,)"
5990,I.,He plann’d the journey to that sylvan bow’r
5991,I.,"Where stood the cot, and urg’d his anxious tour:"
5992,I.,"Consider’d well the steps that he should take,"
5993,I.,"And how t’approach the little shingle-gate,"
5994,I.,"O’er-arch’d with honeysuckle in full bloom,"
5995,I.,Which form’d the portal to that humble home.
5996,I.,"Forth Arnold went: he listen’d, heard the clock—"
5997,I.,"The only sound within, then gave a knock:"
5998,I.,He knock’d again: remained in deep suspense:
5999,I.,"Went round the oak, on to the rearward fence:"
6000,I.,"There he beheld, with his unerring eye,"
6001,I.,Jane Hollybrand! he spoke: thus her reply:—
6002,I.,"“My father is at work, sir, in the field"
6003,I.,Preparing there the fallow to be till’d;
6004,I.,"And, sir, I’m sure he never will consent"
6005,I.,"For me to leave this humble tenement,—"
6006,I.,Nay: all the promises on earth will not
6007,I.,Suffice t’induce him let me leave this cot:”
6008,I.,(Now all the time this conversation pass’d
6009,I.,Persuasive Arnold’s hand in Jane’s was clasp’d;
6010,I.,"But she could not, so timid, understand"
6011,I.,Wherefore and why he thus desired her hand.)
6012,I.,"“And, sir, my mother has been long since dead,"
6013,I.,"And father, only, earns our daily bread:”"
6014,I.,Continued Jane: “but if you’d like to go
6015,I.,"To see my father, where you observe the plough,[180]"
6016,I.,"And you should find him willing to comply,"
6017,I.,"Why sir,” * * * She paus’d, and wept, a tear fell from her eye!—"
6018,I.,"Her heart was full: and, blushing, fain would cry."
6019,I.,
6020,I.,"[180] Pointing to the field, which could be seen from the garden, where"
6021,I.,they were standing.
6022,I.,
6023,I.,
6024,II.,II.
6025,II.,
6026,II.,"Now Arnold saw, and ventur’d the first kiss!"
6027,II.,And said (the while her hand still lock’d in his)
6028,II.,"“You do not know me, do you?—O! sweet girl."
6029,II.,"Ope those bright eyes, and turn aside that curl."
6030,II.,And try if you can recollect in me
6031,II.,The one who kiss’d and vow’d he lovèd thee
6032,II.,"Full fifteen years ago. Come,” Arnold said,"
6033,II.,(Thus as he spoke Jane gently rais’d her head)
6034,II.,"“Come, dearest maiden, pray thee be not shy—"
6035,II.,"Believe the truth, believe me; nay: I’ll die"
6036,II.,"Rather than I’ll deceive thee.” Then Jane sigh’d,"
6037,II.,Desired to speak and lean’d against his side.
6038,II.,To his request she answer’d modestly:—
6039,II.,"“Through yonder gateway, thence by yonder tree,"
6040,II.,"Pass through the little furze-brake, o’er the bridge,"
6041,II.,"Turn to your right—along the violet hedge,"
6042,II.,"And there I trust you’ll find him, sir.” So he"
6043,II.,Fail’d not t’obey th’ instructions cheerily.
6044,II.,George saw him coming o’er the fallow ground;
6045,II.,"Hail’d to the horses; paus’d, and turn’d around,"
6046,II.,And bow’d obedience. “Ah! good Hollybrand.”
6047,II.,"Said Arnold, (whilst embracing George’s hand,[181])"
6048,II.,"“I seek thy daughter, and I trust t’obtain"
6049,II.,"Thy sanction, George, to marry dearest Jane,"
6050,II.,Some future day when matters are arrang’d.”
6051,II.,This sudden salutation quickly chang’d
6052,II.,The countenance of George: he stood amaz’d:
6053,II.,Held down his head and on the fallow gaz’d.
6054,II.,"(No doubt poor Hollybrand, as he appear’d,"
6055,II.,Was much confounded; and perhaps he fear’d
6056,II.,More sorrows were in store for him: but no!
6057,II.,For Heaven was smiling on his honest brow.)
6058,II.,"Then, in reply, with falt’ring accents spoke:"
6059,II.,"“I fear, dear sir, thou meanest but a joke.”"
6060,II.,"“Nay, nay,” the suitor said, and thus: “I find,"
6061,II.,"Dear Hollybrand, none other to my mind;"
6062,II.,And should you condescend to give to me
6063,II.,"Thy daughter’s hand, thou shalt survey"
6064,II.,"My flocks and herds, and guide my husbandry."
6065,II.,"Rememb’rest thou, good Hollybrand, the day—"
6066,II.,At least you must have heard your daughter say—
6067,II.,"When I, to bid my uncle to the hall,"
6068,II.,Came in all haste—as aunt had had a fall—
6069,II.,Unto thy cot?—’twas then I first espied
6070,II.,Thy dearest child; altho’ she vainly tried
6071,II.,T’escape my observation: and when you * * *”
6072,II.,George Hollybrand look’d up! believ’d it true:
6073,II.,"“I do remember well,” he said, “the deed you name"
6074,II.,And in thy countenance discern the same.—
6075,II.,"The Prews (said George) are now, alas! no more,—"
6076,II.,Her[182] haughty spirit’s levell’d with the poor;
6077,II.,"But he, the squire, so bountiful and good,"
6078,II.,Will ne’er be equall’d in this neighbourhood;
6079,II.,"In him a father, I may say, I found:"
6080,II.,As to the menial friendly to the hound:
6081,II.,"He lov’d my child, and when the good man died"
6082,II.,As for a father so poor Janie cried.
6083,II.,"But, sir, the step which you propose to take"
6084,II.,"Is one, I’m sure for my dear daughter’s sake,"
6085,II.,Requires consideration; and ’tis fraught
6086,II.,With desolation to my little cot.”
6087,II.,"While George thus said,—Lord Arnold, deep in thought,"
6088,II.,Conceived * * * and urg’d * * * to which George gave consent;
6089,II.,"Released the plough, and to the cottage went."
6090,II.,"Meanwhile, observant, Jane had busy been,"
6091,II.,"Had sought her toilet, and withdrew a “queen;”"
6092,II.,"(Whilst lordly Jove had ’woke the latent fire,"
6093,II.,And junior Cupid fann’d her meek desire;)
6094,II.,"Thus she appear’d, tho’ plain was her attire."

6101,III.,III.
6102,III.,
6103,III.,When now the oak had split in countless streams
6104,III.,"The mid-day monarch’s bright propitious beams,—"
6105,III.,A branch of which reflected through the door[183]
6106,III.,"Spread, transiently, a carpet o’er the floor,—"
6107,III.,"Jane sat expectant, watch’d with anxious care"
6108,III.,The mutual movements of th’ approaching pair:
6109,III.,"At length their voices fell upon her ear,"
6110,III.,"And she retards a half-unconscious tear,"
6111,III.,Withdraws in haste into the inner room;
6112,III.,There speculates upon her likely doom—
6113,III.,"Until she hears the gate’s familiar sound,—"
6114,III.,And hence their footsteps on the pebbled ground.
6115,III.,"They enter. Now, her father bids her come"
6116,III.,And welcome Arnold to their hallow’d home:
6117,III.,"His kindly voice she instantly obeys,"
6118,III.,Thus sheds the lustre of her beaming eyes.
6119,III.,"Renewing his embraces, Arnold strove"
6120,III.,To comfort and console her with his love;
6121,III.,"And re-assured her, with a winning smile,"
6122,III.,That in his breast there lurk’d no inward guile:
6123,III.,The tone and accent of his gentle voice
6124,III.,"Made honest Hollybrand, for once, rejoice;"
6125,III.,"Who, long inured to oft-recurring grief—"
6126,III.,As oft to Heaven consign’d his pray’rful brief—
6127,III.,"Now, as his wont, he trusted, found relief."

6134,IV.,"Then Jane, obedient to her father’s will,"
6135,IV.,"Brought forth a pitcher of their household ale,"
6136,IV.,And from the larder at the cottage rear
6137,IV.,"The frugal remnant of a well-fed steer,—"
6138,IV.,"With which, and some brown-bread, she form’d a feast,"
6139,IV.,To entertain—as best they could—their noble guest:
6140,IV.,"And not untimely was the feast supplied,"
6141,IV.,"Partook, digested, and right-well enjoy’d."
6142,IV.,"The amber goblet pass’d from hand to hand,"
6143,IV.,"And as it pass’d—a health to Hollybrand,"
6144,IV.,"Else his dear daughter Jane, with good intent;"
6145,IV.,They in return return’d the compliment:
6146,IV.,"So pass’d the meal. Now, to confirm his vow,"
6147,IV.,The earnest suitor kiss’d Jane’s virtuous brow;
6148,IV.,"Reveal’d a compact, and then read it o’er;"
6149,IV.,"And, pointing to the impression which it bore,"
6150,IV.,"Said, “There, dear Hollybrand, and Jane, you see"
6151,IV.,"My signature is set, in all sincerity:"
6152,IV.,"With thee I’ll leave it, and my honour too,"
6153,IV.,As the best pledge of my designs to you;—
6154,IV.,"Take it,” said Arnold, “as my heart—my whole—"
6155,IV.,For it contains the promptings of my soul:
6156,IV.,May God bear witness to the solemn deed!
6157,IV.,"And now I ask, dear George, are you agreed?”"
6158,IV.,The emphasis with which these words were spoke’
6159,IV.,(Whilst modest Hollybrand the paper took)
6160,IV.,Produced a meet sensation!—hence a pause
6161,IV.,Consistent with th’ importance of the cause.
6162,IV.,Then George into the inner room withdrew
6163,IV.,"To scan the documents, in earnest, through:"
6164,IV.,"He saw: believ’d the signature was real,"
6165,IV.,And also recognis’d the ancient seal.
6166,IV.,
6167,IV.,
6168,V.,V.
6169,V.,
6170,V.,"Strange it might seem—that George, this afternoon,"
6171,V.,Should recollect—’though thirteen years had flown—
6172,V.,"He had, secreted, at his own command"
6173,V.,"A ready answer to the lord’s demand,—"
6174,V.,Yet so it was; and where the secret lay
6175,V.,He interposed and brought it prone to day:
6176,V.,Thus thought the man; and now unto his eyes
6177,V.,"An artificial medium he applies,—"
6178,V.,"Compares the image[184] which should be the test,"
6179,V.,And which would rob or give his temples rest:
6180,V.,"“Ah! (he exclaim’d) it is, it is the same;”"
6181,V.,"And having thus discern’d his honor’d name,"
6182,V.,"Return’d with joy and, smiling, said “Dear Sir,"
6183,V.,Thou art the late Lord Mountjoy’s son ’tis clear:
6184,V.,"And now, (said Hollybrand, whilst in the act"
6185,V.,Of holding forth and pointing to the fact)
6186,V.,This truth unquestionably doth impel
6187,V.,The answer I now give: God speed thee well—
6188,V.,"O Arnold, friend indeed!” (with scarce control"
6189,V.,O’er the emotions of his manly soul.)—
6190,V.,"And thus—with falt’ring speech, and quite unnerv’d,"
6191,V.,"“I give my bond, for thou hast well deserv’d"
6192,V.,"My dearest child, for thy integrity—"
6193,V.,Thy gentleness—and generosity.”
6194,V.,"“Well, Hollybrand, I’m glad your mind’s at ease,”"
6195,V.,"Said Arnold Mountjoy, “for thy daughter’s is,—"
6196,V.,In thy brief absence she has thrice confess’d
6197,V.,The silent promptings of her youthful breast:
6198,V.,"Henceforth our lives must interwoven be,"
6199,V.,And this the dawn of thy prosperity.”
6200,V.,"(Now the adventure, thus concisely told;"
6201,V.,"Nor less concise and pleasant, as so bold;"

6203,V.,The “cottage queen” should with her lover go
6204,V.,"To Rollingate; and there, God willing it,"
6205,V.,"Domesticated at his noble seat,"
6206,V.,"She should be educated, and prepare"
6207,V.,To share the duties of the “lordly heir.”
6208,V.,Till then Lord Arnold thought it ill-advis’d
6209,V.,The marriage contract should be solemniz’d;—
6210,V.,"“I’ve friends,” said he, “who then I must invite—"
6211,V.,Whose presence our good manners must requite:”
6212,V.,And twelve months hence he felt convinc’d dear Jane
6213,V.,Would those accomplishments of life attain:
6214,V.,"Twelve other months, besides, George then shall see"
6215,V.,"His virgin daughter at the altar, free—"
6216,V.,"Free as the zephyrs which combine the air,—"
6217,V.,"For he had sworn he’d never trespass there,"
6218,V.,Or jeopardize her sovereign right to be
6219,V.,The wife of him who wins her lawfully.)
6220,V.,"To this,[185] like as a harp without the hand,"
6221,V.,Stood speechless unpretending Hollybrand;
6222,V.,"And, waiting ’til the impulse bade him speak,"
6223,V.,Diverts a tear from his imbrownèd cheek;
6224,V.,"Then he, in language not inapt, begun:"
6225,V.,"“Thy father, Arnold, must have loved his son!”—"
6226,V.,But as his heart had urged him thus to say
6227,V.,His tongue grew pow’rless and refused t’obey.

6242,VI.,"With her transcendent beams of silvery light,"
6243,VI.,Was riding onward in her chair of state;
6244,VI.,While he[186]—her lord and sovereign potentate—
6245,VI.,Roll’d down th’ horizon o’er the western seas

6248,VI.,Peal’d forth its plaint upon the breezy wave;

6250,VI.,Was floating on the balmy winds of heaven—
6251,VI.,"Arnold embraced the moments as they flew,"
6252,VI.,"Kiss’d his dear girl, prepared for his adieu,"
6253,VI.,"And bade farewell,—but ere the last was spoken"
6254,VI.,He’d made a promise never to be broken;
6255,VI.,"(’Less Death, regardless of the night, the day,"
6256,VI.,Should interpose his awful majesty;)
6257,VI.,And to impress with due solemnity
6258,VI.,The parting vow on these meek peasantry
6259,VI.,He gave to Jane—himself proud of the gift—
6260,VI.,A locket which his grandmother had left
6261,VI.,"Him when a babe, which (dazzling to the eyes,"
6262,VI.,"Of envious worth and of capacious size,)"
6263,VI.,"“You’ll keep,” he said, “until I have fulfill’d"

6266,VI.,Before from thy dear cot I take my leave
6267,VI.,This little token[187] of my kind regards—
6268,VI.,"’Twill tell thee, George,” said Arnold, “more than words—"

6392,IX.,To whomsoever may be passing by:
6393,IX.,"Perhaps at night, some place offensive slunk,"
6394,IX.,They curse the giver and get beastly drunk.
6395,IX.,"And then th’ eccentric roadside “public” signs,[194]"
6396,IX.,"Grotesquely figured, and inscribed with lines"
6397,IX.,As various writ as various the designs:—
6398,IX.,“The Rose and Crown.” “The Stag.” “The Bull.” “The Bear.”
6399,IX.,"The “Coach and Horses.” “Horses, Hounds, and Hare.”"
6400,IX.,“The Rising Sun.” “The Seven Stars.” “Half-moon.”
6401,IX.,“The Maid and Magpie:” and “The Old Green Man.”
6402,IX.,Of “Heads”—The Duke’s: The Queen’s: The King’s. “King’s Arms.”—
6403,IX.,"High-colour’d frontages, whose wondrous charms—"
6404,IX.,To the unwary—oft are fraught with ill;
6405,IX.,"While he, the “landlord,” dotes upon his till."
6406,IX.,"All these[195] attend to make the trav’ler smile,"
6407,IX.,"To less’ the length, as ’twere, of every mile."

6420,X.,"When Arnold reach’d his own paternal hall,"
6421,X.,(As punctual to his word as the great ball
6422,X.,"Which in the morn fulfils the promis’d boon,"
6423,X.,"Or as, at night, comes forth the gracious moon,"
6424,X.,"By God’s consent,) he took his pen and wrote"
6425,X.,With dexterous hand the first momentous note;
6426,X.,For otherwise the moment would be lost
6427,X.,"To catch, at the lodge-gate, the evening post:"
6428,X.,’Tis done: and now along the turnpike main
6429,X.,The mail bears on the destiny of Jane.

6433,XI.,
6434,XI.,"Next, when this first and most propitious brief"
6435,XI.,"Had reach’d the cot, alternate joy and grief"
6436,XI.,"With equal pressure influenc’d Jane’s breast,"
6437,XI.,And oft at night prevented needful rest;
6438,XI.,"Her sire, (as she,) alternately would sigh,—"
6439,XI.,As oft he smil’d as oft bedew’d his eye:
6440,XI.,"“A month,” said George, “will soon have pass’d away,"
6441,XI.,"And then a week, and then another day,"
6442,XI.,And then the moment when my child is gone!—
6443,XI.,"And I (he said most sorrowf’lly), alone!”"
6444,XI.,"Jane sobb’d and sigh’d, whilst George desired her cease—"
6445,XI.,"“It’s all for good, my dear, come be at peace,”"
6446,XI.,"Said he; but no,—her heart, poor girl, was full:"
6447,XI.,No human solacy could then control
6448,XI.,"Her virtuous bosom; nought could check the flood,"
6449,XI.,Until she clasp’d her hands and look’d to God!
6450,XI.,"And then she scann’d the cottage whitewash’d walls,"
6451,XI.,Where hung a picture of “Niag’ra Falls;”
6452,XI.,"’Mong several others—one, our Saviour’s birth,[196]"
6453,XI.,"Seem’d, of them all, the one of greatest worth,"
6454,XI.,For she had learnt to love Him: then again
6455,XI.,"Jane read the letter in more hopeful strain,"
6456,XI.,And grew more reconciled unto her fate:
6457,XI.,Some of her childhood scenes she’d ’numerate;—
6458,XI.,To Jane’s sweet memory would oft recur
6459,XI.,"The fun and frolic at the village fair,—"
6460,XI.,"Held once a year,—and whither she would go"
6461,XI.,"To hear the bumpkin band, and see the “show:”"
6462,XI.,This was a happy period of her life:
6463,XI.,"Her mother liv’d, and was a loving wife"
6464,XI.,To Hollybrand. (Ah! George had praised her so
6465,XI.,That when she died most dreadful was the blow.)[197]
6466,XI.,As then each Sunday morning came along
6467,XI.,"Jane heard the village-church bells go ding-dong,"
6468,XI.,(When her dear mother liv’d and stay’d at home)
6469,XI.,"And, with her father, forth would early roam"
6470,XI.,"To pay their homage on the Sabbath day,"
6471,XI.,In God’s own house. The villagers would say
6472,XI.,(Though with a sort of semi-jealous air)—
6473,XI.,“That Jenny gain’d admirers everywhere:”
6474,XI.,"Well! no one, rich or poor, could pass her by"
6475,XI.,Without being charm’d with her impressive eye:
6476,XI.,"And whilst at church she rais’d her voice to God,"
6477,XI.,"Was never seen to chatter, laugh, or nod:"
6478,XI.,"And never fail’d to gather every word,"
6479,XI.,As it would fall upon her list’ning ear:—
6480,XI.,"Sometimes poor “Jenny” dropp’d a silent tear,"
6481,XI.,And some kind folks began to pity her—
6482,XI.,"Poor girl; for then her mother lay so ill,"
6483,XI.,"It almost made the child, herself, unwell."
6484,XI.,"T’her poor dear mother she’d read the Sunday book,"
6485,XI.,Turn up her eyes and with a solemn look—
6486,XI.,Yet with a kind of smile—say this (and more)—
6487,XI.,"“O Lord, have mercy on the sick, and poor!”"
6488,XI.,
6489,XI.,"[196] The proper title of this picture was, no doubt, “The birth of our"

6496,XII.,
6497,XII.,Jane now began (as Arnold wish’d) to arrange
6498,XII.,"Her little wardrobe, for th’ approaching change."
6499,XII.,From humble life she soon was to withdraw
6500,XII.,"To Rollingate,—there learn the “genteel law,”"
6501,XII.,’Midst scenes of gaiety; (but yet aloof;)—
6502,XII.,"To learn in private, ’neath the mansion roof,"
6503,XII.,The necessary etiquette—for she
6504,XII.,The future hope of Arnold was to be.
6505,XII.,"Tears flow’d, and oft, as day and night flew past;"
6506,XII.,More often still at every eve-repast:
6507,XII.,The cottage-home serenity had fled;
6508,XII.,And George look’d forward with an earthly dread
6509,XII.,To that sad day; his very heart recoil’d—
6510,XII.,To think of parting with his only child!
6511,XII.,"But Hollybrand, though passionately fond,"
6512,XII.,"Had giv’n his word, and hence fulfill’d his bond."
6513,XII.,
6514,XII.,
6515,XIII.,XIII.
6516,XIII.,
6517,XIII.,"At length the month, the week, the day had flown,"
6518,XIII.,"And high in heav’n revolved the silent moon,—"
6519,XIII.,"The night had come; and (save the poor girl’s heart,"
6520,XIII.,Which now began to fail and dread to part)
6521,XIII.,All’s ready: but the evening’s pensive shade
6522,XIII.,"Unmann’d the heart, o’er forty years had made:"
6523,XIII.,"Poor George felt sad—indeed, well, well he might—"
6524,XIII.,Whilst pondering o’er the last long-dreaded night;
6525,XIII.,He knew too well that when the morning came
6526,XIII.,To him his child would only be a name.
6527,XIII.,Thus then to pray’rs:—Upon their bended knee
6528,XIII.,"They sent their orisons forth unto God, that He"
6529,XIII.,Would grant to them (especially to her)
6530,XIII.,"His favoring spirit, and His bounteous care."
6531,XIII.,"And from its bounds the briny-liquid lept,"
6532,XIII.,"For Hollybrand could not refrain, and wept:"
6533,XIII.,"The last “good night,” with intermissive sighs,"
6534,XIII.,Fell from their lips; while ’kerchiefs to their eyes
6535,XIII.,Detain’d their tears: Such was the dreary eve
6536,XIII.,Of that lone day when “Jenny” took her leave.
6537,XIII.,
6538,XIII.,
6539,XIV.,XIV.
6540,XIV.,
6541,XIV.,"Red ’rose the sun, and flush’d the fleecy sky;"
6542,XIV.,His ’fulgent rays foretold the hour was nigh
6543,XIV.,"When soon the cottagers would ope their eye,"
6544,XIV.,"For chanticleer had loos’d his horny bill,"
6545,XIV.,And sent abroad his unmistaken thrill.
6546,XIV.,That honor’d oak bore up a motley throng
6547,XIV.,"Of feathery warblers, lively with their song;"
6548,XIV.,"Beneath the tree the chickens ’wait the hour,"
6549,XIV.,Then rush like steeple-chasers to the door:
6550,XIV.,"And, helter-skelter, forth the bristled beast"
6551,XIV.,With usual manners begg’d their usual feast:
6552,XIV.,"(Could they have known their mistress sigh’d and cried,"
6553,XIV.,No doubt the cloven group would have denied
6554,XIV.,Themselves one meal at least; and would have mourn’d
6555,XIV.,"With Hollybrand, his loss; for Jane adorn’d"
6556,XIV.,"That little cot so long, ’twas sure unkind"
6557,XIV.,"To leave it now, and everything behind:)"
6558,XIV.,"But Jane came not, as usual, forth to feed"
6559,XIV.,"The drowsy grunters; so, to lull their greed,"
6560,XIV.,George did for once (but not without much pain)
6561,XIV.,"Strew out, among them all, the crumbs and grain,"
6562,XIV.,"And fill’d the trough. ’Twas now the hour of eight,"
6563,XIV.,"When lo! they heard a noise,—the birds took flight,—"
6564,XIV.,’Twas like the sound of carriages afar:
6565,XIV.,At length they see the fastly-driven car.
6566,XIV.,"Jane then, ’mid hopes and fears, tripp’d ’cross the floor"
6567,XIV.,And saw the coach advancing to the door!
6568,XIV.,"Another moment, whilst, embracing her,"
6569,XIV.,Lord Arnold’s kisses stayed the falling tear.
6570,XIV.,"His mode of greeting, and his gentle grace,"
6571,XIV.,Implanted joy-looks on poor George’s face;—
6572,XIV.,For Arnold’s winning manners never fail’d
6573,XIV.,To cheer the hearts of those whom grief assail’d:
6574,XIV.,"They all sit down (the morning meal is spread),"
6575,XIV.,"But George, at times, seem’d sad and sore afraid;"
6576,XIV.,At intervals he scarcely could restrain
6577,XIV.,From weeping: Arnold now announc’d to Jane
6578,XIV.,"The time was fast approaching when, in fact,"
6579,XIV.,Her luggage in the carriage should be pack’d:
6580,XIV.,"Then she, in answer, to her room repairs"
6581,XIV.,"And, more serene, her humble self prepares;"
6582,XIV.,"Return’d, and what? a picture to behold,—"
6583,XIV.,Her eyes like diamonds unadorn’d with gold:
6584,XIV.,With hasty steps she gain’d her father’s side;
6585,XIV.,"Her lifted hands a screen became, to hide"
6586,XIV.,Once more her sad and saturated cheek:
6587,XIV.,"In tones subdued, unnerv’d, she tries to speak,"
6588,XIV.,"(Her words were ’sunder’d with repeated sighs,)"
6589,XIV.,"And then a pause; and then again she tries,"
6590,XIV.,"Say’ng—“Father, father, oh! ’tis sad to part;"
6591,XIV.,"But, father, trust in God, and cheer your heart.”"
6592,XIV.,"These were the words, the parting words of those"
6593,XIV.,Whose cottage sanctity was just about to close.
6594,XIV.,"One moment more must bring that last “farewell,”—"
6595,XIV.,Whose import—none but George and Jane could tell;
6596,XIV.,"And Hollybrand, now left alone to dwell!"
6597,XIV.,
6598,XIV.,
6599,XV.,XV.
6600,XV.,
6601,XV.,"George, recollecting Arnold’s solemn vow,"
6602,XV.,Bethought himself of future joy: and so—
6603,XV.,"In silent solitude—he work’d away,"
6604,XV.,And tried to gather comfort through the day.
6605,XV.,He doubted not that Arnold would redeem
6606,XV.,The solemn pledges he had made to him—
6607,XV.,"That he should come and live on his estate,—"
6608,XV.,Live at the lodge and keep the entrance-gate:
6609,XV.,"(Adjoining which were well-plann’d premises,"
6610,XV.,"For cows or pigs; for chickens, ducks or geese:)"
6611,XV.,"And there, such things should be at his command,"
6612,XV.,As compensation for his daughter’s hand:
6613,XV.,"This, for his life-time, should be set apart;"
6614,XV.,Together with a nice light horse-and-cart.
6615,XV.,"But ere this possibly could be enjoy’d,"
6616,XV.,"Full eight months more, his time must be employ’d"
6617,XV.,"At Westonbury,—there (in sun or shade)"
6618,XV.,To serve the year’s engagement he had made
6619,XV.,With the new occupants now at the Hall;—
6620,XV.,"For all the Prews were gone—yes, one and all"
6621,XV.,Were gone to their long home! So George worked on
6622,XV.,Until these eight months’ solitude had flown:
6623,XV.,But not a week pass’d by without the post
6624,XV.,Convey’d to Hollybrand (from one who cost
6625,XV.,"Him many a tear) a letter; which scann’d o’er,"
6626,XV.,Infused in George—a hundred times or more—
6627,XV.,"A gleam of joy; and, oft when he would pore"
6628,XV.,"Each well-filled page, he’d turn to her dear name,"
6629,XV.,Imprint a kiss—and then infold the same.

6670,I.,"Or, when ’presented in a wintry storm,"

6672,I.,And then again—behold his[198] emerald glade
6673,I.,"How breezy-bent it greets the crescent blade,"
6674,I.,"When, as it were, ten mowers (rosy blithe)"
6675,I.,Advance by steps and sway the merc’less scythe;

6690,II.,Since George and Jane partook their parting meal.
6691,II.,And here—a quaint secluded neighbourhood—
6692,II.,"Just where the ruins of a convent stood,"
6693,II.,A group of gipsies (tented in a cove)
6694,II.,Bore tokens of contentment and of love:
6695,II.,"One of the tribe advanced towards the coach,"
6696,II.,And begg’d permission that she might approach:
6697,II.,"Lord Arnold stopp’d, and lent his gen’rous ear,"
6698,II.,Whilst she address’d him with a gentle air:
6699,II.,"And then, observing Arnold’s willing smile,"
6700,II.,(He not unmindful of their practis’d guile)
6701,II.,"Rehears’d a story with considerable tact,"
6702,II.,And hard-endeavoured to enforce the fact—
6703,II.,"Peace and prosperity for thee’s in store,"
6704,II.,For thou art generous to the sick and poor!
6705,II.,"“Two years from now,” she said, “thou shalt repair"
6706,II.,To Hymen’s altar with your lady-fair;
6707,II.,"And when, dear sir, the nuptial hour shall come"
6708,II.,Much joy shall reign at thy paternal home:
6709,II.,"Then, when twelve moons their course hath duly run,"
6710,II.,Thy virtuous wife shall bless thee with a son!”
6711,II.,"This startling prophecy astounded Jane,"
6712,II.,Who seem’d desirous to proceed again;
6713,II.,But ere they started Arnold threw her down
6714,II.,A goodly portion of a “half-a-crown:”
6715,II.,"“God bless you sir,” she pleasingly replies:"
6716,II.,"“And you, dear lady, with those lucky eyes,—"
6717,II.,Ten thousand comforts ’wait thee in thy bow’r;
6718,II.,And Heav’n shall smile upon thy wedding-hour.”
6719,II.,"Then Arnold, gathering in the careless rein,"
6720,II.,Inclined his whip across the horses mane;
6721,II.,"They bend their twin-like necks as they proceed,"
6722,II.,And soon attain the regulated speed.
6723,II.,The converse now continued for awhile
6724,II.,Upon the subject of the gipsy’s tale;
6725,II.,"When Jane, consistent with her lowly sphere,"
6726,II.,Relieved her eye of an incredulous tear:
6727,II.,"Her hope was where it had continually soar’d,"
6728,II.,And forth in secret there her pray’rs were pour’d.
6729,II.,"E’en, as the coach resum’d the onward course,"
6730,II.,"A thought struck Arnold, with emphatic force,—"
6731,II.,"That this sly woman, dexterous and sedate,"
6732,II.,Might have inform’d herself on the estate:
6733,II.,"“How cunning,” thought he; “well, it is their trade,"

6743,III.,And which commandingly arose to view;
6744,III.,The pale-blue smoke curl’d up anon anew;
6745,III.,And on a mound the flag-staff bore on high
6746,III.,"The family-banner, in the sun-set sky."
6747,III.,"Above—there waited the pale queen of night,"
6748,III.,With her retaining beams of holy light;
6749,III.,Then condescending to the happy pair—
6750,III.,When Sol had vanish’d—strew’d her silvery care:
6751,III.,"O righteous moon, refulgent in the skies!—"
6752,III.,"All poets greet thee with their longing eyes,—"
6753,III.,Thou art to them a river of delight;
6754,III.,Their choicest pages praise thee with their might:

6760,III.,Most welcome were its hallow’d beams to those
6761,III.,Whose long day’s journey drew near to a close.
6762,III.,"Th’ exhausted horses knew the well-trod ground,"
6763,III.,And long’d to hear the groom’s inducing sound;
6764,III.,"The grooms, they listen, and are glad to hear"
6765,III.,The distant rumbling which disturbs the deer:
6766,III.,"The whizzing whip re-echoed through the trees,"
6767,III.,"And Arnold’s voice came with the western breeze,—"
6768,III.,The sound increased as forth they onward bore
6769,III.,"In steady paces, to the mansion-door."
6770,III.,"High up, in night, now sat “The dark-robed moon;”[199]"
6771,III.,"Whilst round about her purple-drapèd throne,"

6773,III.,Unite in love to welcome forth the maid.
6774,III.,Great is the joy throughout the boundless vast.

6786,III.,"And swords and bucklers, which had hung for years,"
6787,III.,"Seem’d coalescing, with the central vase[200]"
6788,III.,"Which saved its perfumes until then, and rose"

6807,IV.,Transcendent morn ’rose o’er yon barley-field;
6808,IV.,But dusky clouds fly’ng ’cross the golden shield
6809,IV.,"Dispersed his beams; yet, he controll’d the main,"
6810,IV.,And usher’d in a brighter day for Jane.
6811,IV.,"She ’wakes (her wonted hour), looks ’round and finds"
6812,IV.,Rich damask drapery for her window-blinds!
6813,IV.,"Chairs, almost fairy-like with ’lastic touch,"
6814,IV.,Resemble the impurpled-cover’d couch.
6815,IV.,Then half-recumbent lo: the gentle girl
6816,IV.,Beholds the furniture inlaid with pearl!
6817,IV.,"Herself she now reflectedly espies,"
6818,IV.,But scarce believing her yet slumb’rous eyes—
6819,IV.,"’Til, opportune, the wardrobe glass disclosed"
6820,IV.,"The doubtful myst’ry; then she grew composed,"
6821,IV.,"Alighted venturously on the soft floor,"
6822,IV.,And scann’d the toilet o’er and o’er and o’er:
6823,IV.,She timorously removes[202] the window-blind;
6824,IV.,"Observes, with pleasure, the fantastic hind,"
6825,IV.,"The antler’d buck, the mother and her fawn;"
6826,IV.,And all the beauties of the verdured lawn.
6827,IV.,"The ivy tendrils kiss’d her window-pane,"
6828,IV.,And further rearward wound the jessamine
6829,IV.,"With other fragrant vines. Now, Jane, she makes"
6830,IV.,Another survey t’wards the glist’ning lakes:
6831,IV.,"There she beholds, most gracefully afloat—"
6832,IV.,The silvery swans; and there the anchor’d boat
6833,IV.,"Hugg’d the green bank. All nature smiles, as ’twere;"
6834,IV.,And passing showers cool’d the atmosphere;
6835,IV.,While birds among[203] made music sweet and clear.
6836,IV.,"On bended knee, Jane’s orisons had flown"
6837,IV.,With the appearance of the saffron dawn:
6838,IV.,So now (rememb’ring Arnold’s fond desire
6839,IV.,"To breakfast with her), in her best attire,"
6840,IV.,She decks herself—expectant of a knock:
6841,IV.,"Mid joy and grief she hears the tuneful[204] clock,"
6842,IV.,"Which crown’d the summit of the mansion mews,—"
6843,IV.,The time arrived: now Jane once more re-views
6844,IV.,"Her humble self, and modestly prepares * * *"
6845,IV.,"When lo!—she hears a patting on the stairs,"
6846,IV.,And hies obediently across the floor—
6847,IV.,To welcome Toogood at the appointed hour:
6848,IV.,"With all the sweetness of her youth, she said—"
6849,IV.,“Oh dear! dear ma’am (and sigh’d) I really dread
6850,IV.,To leave the room;” but when Aunt Toogood smil’d
6851,IV.,"And bade Jane cheer, thus say’ng: “Come, come, my child"
6852,IV.,"(In such a winsome mood) and follow me,"
6853,IV.,"For Arnold now is anxious, ’waiting thee,”"
6854,IV.,"She doff’d her trepidness, and went the way."
6855,IV.,And so began the duties[205] of the day.

6870,V.,"Points out the beauties of the oak and elm,"
6871,V.,And other grandeurs of his little realm;
6872,V.,Then guides her to th’ embankment of the lake—
6873,V.,"Where various water-fowl their jauntings take,"
6874,V.,And make—in common with their kindred race—
6875,V.,Untarnish’d pleasure and conjugal peace:
6876,V.,"With some persuasion Arnold gain’d consent,"
6877,V.,"Releas’d the boat, then on the lake is spent"
6878,V.,"A pleasant cruise, ’til sundry drops of rain"
6879,V.,Fell lustily and ringleted the main.
6880,V.,Each fleet intruder from the upper air
6881,V.,Involves the cruisers in increasing care;
6882,V.,"The skiff’s made fast, and both with speed return"
6883,V.,"Along a route through laurel, myrtle, fern;"
6884,V.,Soon as they gain the lofty portico
6885,V.,"Down pours the rain,—a thousand riv’lets flow."
6886,V.,"When, as the clouds have broke, th’ incumbent drops—"
6887,V.,Like diamonds strewn about the verdant crops—
6888,V.,"Sway to and fro in answer to the breeze,—"
6889,V.,The bending blade directs them by degrees
6890,V.,Down to the mould; thus mingled with the roots
6891,V.,"The earth brings forth its seasonable fruits,"
6892,V.,"And nature laughs. How good such transient showers,"
6893,V.,Unguentous to the parched herbs and flowers!—
6894,V.,"The shrubs are cleans’d, as though re-varnish’d o’er,"

6904,VI.,But grew despairingly as forth he came
6905,VI.,(Like heav’n and earth combin’d in one great flame.)
6906,VI.,Towards the vertex of the brazen arch.
6907,VI.,"But as he came, and with prodigious march,"
6908,VI.,"Meridian waver’d, and declined the fray:"
6909,VI.,Thus onward Horus roll’d triumphantly!
6910,VI.,"The god, though angry with this vain pretence,"
6911,VI.,"Forgave Meridian the unjust offence,—"
6912,VI.,On this condition—that he’d[207] ne’er again
6913,VI.,Dispute his passage through the vaulted main.
6914,VI.,"Meridian thankfully received the boon,"
6915,VI.,And thus renounced all title to the throne.

6917,VI.,
6918,VII.,VII.
6919,VII.,
6920,VII.,"Just as Meridian felt so dire dismay’d,"
6921,VII.,"And ever after so discomforted,"
6922,VII.,The luncheon-bell invited forth the guest—
6923,VII.,To be partakers of the mid-day feast:
6924,VII.,Such food and drinkables meet for the hour
6925,VII.,"Were attributes most welcome, since the tour"
6926,VII.,Occasion’d such exertion to obtain
6927,VII.,The much desired shelter from the rain:
6928,VII.,"Thus then refresh’d, retiring to her room"
6929,VII.,Jane penn’d her first epistle to th’ old home;
6930,VII.,(Ah me! how sweet “th’ old home” falls on the ear
6931,VII.,To all to whomsoever “home” is dear.)
6932,VII.,In language of simplicity she wrote
6933,VII.,Thus: (now in strictest confidence we quote)—
6934,VII.,“My dearest father. We arriv’d last night
6935,VII.,At Rollingate (thank gracious God) all right;
6936,VII.,"We halted twice, refresh’d ourselves, drove on,—"
6937,VII.,Most truly thankful when the day was done:
6938,VII.,Before I laid me down I bent my knee
6939,VII.,And pray’d to Him above to comfort thee;
6940,VII.,"Arose this morning, breakfasted, and talk’d,"
6941,VII.,Then ’round the grounds we comfortably walk’d;
6942,VII.,"We rowed upon the lake among the swans,"
6943,VII.,And fell in love with all the little ones;
6944,VII.,"Just then a rapid show’r began to fall,"
6945,VII.,We hasten’d back and luncheon’d in the Hall:
6946,VII.,All now is quiet; Arnold’s very kind
6947,VII.,"And I, dear father, happier in mind."
6948,VII.,"That dear old lady, whom you heard him say"
6949,VII.,"Was such a motherly creature, said to-day"
6950,VII.,That all at Rollingate were proud of me;
6951,VII.,"So now, dear father, pray thee happy be:"
6952,VII.,"Next week, I purpose, you shall hear again."
6953,VII.,"Believe me * * * yours affectionately, Jane.”"
6954,VII.,Then came the thoughts of how she should proceed
6955,VII.,"To get it posted, and the postage freed,"
6956,VII.,"But just that instant Toogood happily came,"
6957,VII.,And Jane’s distress dissolv’d into a name:
6958,VII.,"The compliant footman took it to the lodge,"
6959,VII.,And there consigned it to old Andrew Hodge.
6960,VII.,"“Old Andrew,” now, was seventy years of age;"
6961,VII.,(Had come to Rollingate erst as a page;)
6962,VII.,"O’er fifty years, it was the old man’s boast,"
6963,VII.,He had been guardian of th’ important post:
6964,VII.,"But then, besides, he rode about th’ estate,—"
6965,VII.,"A sort of bailiff over Rollingate,"
6966,VII.,"And superintendent of the flocks and herds,"
6967,VII.,"The deer, the swine, and the domestic birds,—"
6968,VII.,He made arrangements for the animal sale
6969,VII.,"Of surplus cattle; oak, and ashen, pale;"
6970,VII.,The over-crowding firs and elms and pines;
6971,VII.,And kept with strict regard the bound’ry lines;
6972,VII.,"Such then was Andrew’s alternating work,"
6973,VII.,With his kind niece at home as medium clerk.
6974,VII.,Though now the poor old man had grown infirm
6975,VII.,"From partial palsy in his dexter[208] arm,"
6976,VII.,And sometimes suffer’d almost martyrdom
6977,VII.,"With the lumbago in his back and loins,"
6978,VII.,And painful visitations in his groins;
6979,VII.,"So that a few years more like this, distress’d,"
6980,VII.,Must of necessity send him to rest.

6993,VIII.,Who never turn’d a beggar from the door
6994,VIII.,"Without a penny and some surplus store,)"
6995,VIII.,Appriz’d dear Jane that dinner-time was near—
6996,VIII.,If she would be so kind as to prepare;
6997,VIII.,And waited ’til she wash’d and plann’d her hair;
6998,VIII.,Whilst Jane made such inquiries which become
6999,VIII.,So lowly-a stranger to so lordly-a home.
7000,VIII.,"And the blithe bell, diminutive in size,"
7001,VIII.,Sent forth its welcome in the blissful skies—
7002,VIII.,As though a host of potentates were there
7003,VIII.,"Prebent on turkey, venison, and hare;—"
7004,VIII.,"Not so just now, yet shall its merry ting"
7005,VIII.,Continue its accustom’d carolling.—
7006,VIII.,The time may come again when princely guest
7007,VIII.,Shall be the bidden-ones unto the feast;
7008,VIII.,When round the hall the old ancestral cup
7009,VIII.,By lords and ladies shall be lifted up;
7010,VIII.,But in the interim there is much to do:
7011,VIII.,Around its orbit twice the world shall go
7012,VIII.,"Before the ancient dignity’s restored,"
7013,VIII.,And knights and squires admixture at the board:
7014,VIII.,"(Yes, two ’volutions round the sun is plann’d"
7015,VIII.,"Ere Jane shall doff the name of “Hollybrand,”"
7016,VIII.,For that of “Mountjoy;” and when that is done
7017,VIII.,The old festivities shall be begun.)—
7018,VIII.,"“To-day at dinner there will only be,”"
7019,VIII.,"Said Toogood, “Arnold, you—my dear, and me:"
7020,VIII.,"But, dearest girl, I have a word to say—"
7021,VIII.,You know that Arnold thinks of going away
7022,VIII.,"A fortnight hence for just a year or two,"
7023,VIII.,"For—as he says—the benefit of you,—"
7024,VIII.,"Yes, dearest Jane,—the benefit of you!—"
7025,VIII.,"He’s going, he tells me, to the far-off East—"
7026,VIII.,"To Rome, Vienna, Berlin, and Trieste."
7027,VIII.,In the meantime (please God to grant it so)
7028,VIII.,Such education as is _apropos_—
7029,VIII.,"For instance: grammar, ’rithmetic, and prose,"
7030,VIII.,"Geography, and music, and all those"
7031,VIII.,"Embellishments—enrichments of the mind,"
7032,VIII.,"And such-like things which make us good and kind,"
7033,VIII.,"You’ll learn, dear Jane, from gentlemen of wit;"
7034,VIII.,That with their teaching you may be found fit
7035,VIII.,To fill the duties which on you will fall
7036,VIII.,"When you are, darling, mistress of the Hall!”"
7037,VIII.,"Now this announcement, evidently made"
7038,VIII.,With all affection for the gentle maid
7039,VIII.,To meliorate the anxiety of mind
7040,VIII.,"Which must accrue, was (doubtless) well design’d;"
7041,VIII.,"And equally as well digested, as"
7042,VIII.,"Poor Jane, know’ng well how ignorant she was,"
7043,VIII.,"Told dear Aunt Toogood of her willingness,"
7044,VIII.,And trusted it would lead to happiness.

7047,VIII.,
7048,VIII.,
7049,IX.,IX.
7050,IX.,
7051,IX.,But hark! the festal-bell is ringing loud;
7052,IX.,"And Toogood, sev’nty-three, as ever proud"
7053,IX.,Comes strutting through the passage to the hall
7054,IX.,"In the same silk, and likewise handsome shawl,"
7055,IX.,That she received at Arnold’s christening ball;
7056,IX.,"Whilst Jane, all in the vigour of her youth,"
7057,IX.,"Leans on her arm—exemplary of truth,"
7058,IX.,But plainly dress’d; yet with a lovely face;
7059,IX.,And paced the passage with a queenly grace.
7060,IX.,Now Arnold meets them and allays alarm—
7061,IX.,By his embraces and inviting arm;
7062,IX.,Whilst dear Aunt Toogood hastens on before
7063,IX.,And blithely deputizes at the door;
7064,IX.,Which ceremonial frolicsomely plann’d
7065,IX.,Dispell’d those fears that Innocence had fann’d:
7066,IX.,Thus then they enter and draw near the board.
7067,IX.,While the vouchsafing grace from God’s implored
7068,IX.,"The savoury viands, which compose the food,"
7069,IX.,Send up their vapours in consonant mode;
7070,IX.,"And wines, propitious—in the crystal vase,"
7071,IX.,Move round in token of th’ eventful cause:
7072,IX.,The homely meal—as homely as could be
7073,IX.,Consistent with Lord Arnold’s dignity—
7074,IX.,"Affords them joy. Now, while the time beguiles"
7075,IX.,"And peace and plenty, compliments and smiles"
7076,IX.,"Predominate, Lord Arnold of the hour"
7077,IX.,"Avails himself, describes th’ intended tour,—"
7078,IX.,Improving every moment as it flew
7079,IX.,With tales fictitious or with stories true;
7080,IX.,Or hum’rously endeavours to explain
7081,IX.,"The great advantage it will be to Jane,"
7082,IX.,Whilst he’s away; and what arrangements he
7083,IX.,Ordain’d for her improvement and futurity:
7084,IX.,"His eye beheld her,—fain was he to find"
7085,IX.,The plan propounded suiting to her mind:
7086,IX.,"For Jane express’d herself with great delight,"
7087,IX.,And promised to improve with all her might.

7090,X.,X.
7091,X.,
7092,X.,Mark how this hope lit up dear Toogood’s breast.—
7093,X.,How her maternal heart seem’d lull’d to rest;
7094,X.,How she endeavour’d—though ’twere vain to try—
7095,X.,To stay the tear now issuing from her eye;
7096,X.,"How she attempted to describe her joy,"
7097,X.,And seem’d in raptures with her darling boy!—
7098,X.,"At length, as though empower’d by Him on high,"
7099,X.,She doffs her tears and draws this imagery—
7100,X.,"“There are,” she said, “some who make chary wives,"
7101,X.,"Are blest with families, and live their lives"
7102,X.,"In sweet contentment, happiness and love,"
7103,X.,Whose guardian is the mighty One above;
7104,X.,But there are others who without a thought
7105,X.,Waste bags of gold and lack at last a groat
7106,X.,"Wherewith to pay, and then—but when too late—"
7107,X.,In tears discover their impoverish’d state;
7108,X.,"Whilst, on the other hand, those keeping well in mind—"
7109,X.,"Economy, will always comfort find;"
7110,X.,Their homes their castles—whether small or great—
7111,X.,"Are ramparts of defence by day or night,—"
7112,X.,"No bitter whinings, nor remorseless sighs,"
7113,X.,"Reproachful twitt’rings o’er invented lies,"
7114,X.,"Are theirs, but truthful love’s protectorate:"
7115,X.,And may God grant it—so at Rollingate!”—
7116,X.,Such was the purport of Aunt Toogood’s tale—
7117,X.,A sort of lecture on a little scale;
7118,X.,Perhaps experience of some family feud
7119,X.,"Had prompted this extemporaneous mood,"
7120,X.,Or the remembrance of some ruined pair
7121,X.,Impelled her speech to tell of their despair;
7122,X.,For ’t seemed to give th’ old lady much relief
7123,X.,"When she had summarised her tale of grief,"
7124,X.,As then again her countenance bespoke
7125,X.,Her readiness to embrace a passing joke;
7126,X.,"And she in turn some funny things would say,"
7127,X.,Then leave to Jove to solve the mystery;
7128,X.,Till Night (nocturnal goddess of the skies)
7129,X.,Invades the hall in mystical disguise
7130,X.,And with due courteousness involved their eyes.

7146,XI.,"Had usher’d in the last and pitiable hour,"
7147,XI.,When that dissyllable—that dread “farewell”
7148,XI.,Will fall from Arnold like a deathful knell!—
7149,XI.,"But true t’his promise he will faithful be,"
7150,XI.,"Should Heaven preserve him over land and sea,"
7151,XI.,For love combined with strict integrity
7152,XI.,"Will well assist him through those trying years,"

7154,XI.,"When, as reluctantly he turn’d around,"

7156,XI.,Sh’ inclined her tearful eyes toward the shade;
7157,XI.,But in the twinkling of an eye it fled:
7158,XI.,“Ah me! (she said) he’s gone—yet not for ever!”
7159,XI.,Now Jane had learnt how painful ’twas to sever
7160,XI.,"From one who dearly lov’d, and whom she lov’d,—"
7161,XI.,"As her demeanour most distinctly prov’d,—"
7162,XI.,For when she looked (in vain) to see the coach

7164,XI.,And there * * * but ere she’d time to vent her grief
7165,XI.,Her kind adviser[213] came to her relief—
7166,XI.,"“Be cheer’d” she said—and bent to stay Jane’s tears,"

7187,XII.,"(Most popular grammar-master of the day,—"

7190,XII.,"Of stature small, but of capacious tact;"
7191,XII.,And of his person wondrously exact.)—
7192,XII.,Who with obeisance and with dexter hand
7193,XII.,Proffer’d his friendship to Jane Hollybrand:
7194,XII.,Jane fain reciprocated his intent
7195,XII.,And lent herself to the first rudiment;
7196,XII.,Her quick conception of the rule consign’d
7197,XII.,Dispell’d the doubts revolving in his mind

7200,XII.,Thus so far pleased with all that he desired

7470,III.,"Direct the labourers; and survey the flock,"
7471,III.,And keep at bay all interdicted stock.[221]
7472,III.,Much joy and comfort seem’d again in store
7473,III.,"For Hollybrand, who once ’gan to deplore"
7474,III.,Almost his own existence; but now he
7475,III.,"Saw in the future some felicity,—"
7476,III.,"And where his thanks were due, there they were pour’d,"

7480,III.,"(With full possession) in that pretty lodge,"
7481,III.,Which so long shelter’d poor old Andrew Hodge:
7482,III.,Yes—it was so; and always on this day
7483,III.,He kept a sort of sacred jubilee.
7484,III.,"It seems, by record, that George Hollybrand was born"
7485,III.,"Some fifty years ago at Merrythorn,"
7486,III.,"Which place (’tis said, by those who’ve sojourn’d there)"
7487,III.,Had gain’d repute for its salubrious air;
7488,III.,"And George’s father—Michael Hollybrand,"
7489,III.,Own’d a small territ’ry of pasture-land;
7490,III.,But owing to some law-suit he sustained—
7491,III.,Worse fortune for his son—was almost ruined:
7492,III.,"His little portion, with regret, was sold"
7493,III.,To meet th’ opposing side’s demand for gold.
7494,III.,"(George, it appears, before to man was grown"
7495,III.,"Went forth to labour, and to earn his own.)"
7496,III.,Thus then ’tis hoped the prospects George now saw

7508,IV.,And where the produce of this large estate—
7509,IV.,"Excepting that required at Rollingate,"
7510,IV.,"Was carted, and there sold as merchandise,"
7511,IV.,Which seldom ever fail’d to realise
7512,IV.,The highest current price. Now it was plann’d
7513,IV.,"The salesman, henceforth, should be Hollybrand,—"
7514,IV.,(For Cartwright[223] thought no man could better be
7515,IV.,Adapted to this branch of sovereignty—
7516,IV.,Besides a fit and proper personage
7517,IV.,To buy and sell and labourers to engage;
7518,IV.,"He also thought for sake of his dear child,"
7519,IV.,That George would see nought wasted or e’er spoil’d.)
7520,IV.,So with th’ assistance of young Martha Gray
7521,IV.,"(Old Andrew’s niece), whom George engaged to stay,"
7522,IV.,"He ’gan to feel at home, and soon became"

7526,IV.,And would assist her master now and then
7527,IV.,"(When he required it) with her ready pen,—"
7528,IV.,Thus then when Hollybrand had to present
7529,IV.,"A statement of his dealings she, intent"
7530,IV.,"Upon the subject, penn’d them most correct’,—"
7531,IV.,As Cartwright seldom ever could detect
7532,IV.,"Aught wrong in the account, but should there be"
7533,IV.,The steward rectified it willingly.
7534,IV.,"Thus George, who scarcely ever had to do"
7535,IV.,"With such important matters hitherto,"
7536,IV.,Became so skilful in the dealing art
7537,IV.,That he was courted at the business mart—
7538,IV.,"Yes, so much so that he at last was ta’en"

7541,IV.,"On Wednesdays at an usual early hour,"
7542,IV.,"George to the township hied, there sold or bought;"
7543,IV.,"His word was honor’d, and his custom sought."
7544,IV.,’Tis fair to say—’Twas not for that alone
7545,IV.,That George was noted at this market town;
7546,IV.,But on account of Arnold’s generousness—
7547,IV.,His great regard for all their happiness;
7548,IV.,"And—proof of this—it was their next intent,—"
7549,IV.,"In illustration of their sentiment,"
7550,IV.,"When he return’d home from the Continent,—"
7551,IV.,With unanimity to celebrate
7552,IV.,Th’ arrival of the Lord of Rollingate.
7553,IV.,"’Twas rare indeed, but where there happ’d to be"
7554,IV.,"A case, or cases, of real poverty"
7555,IV.,"Made known to Arnold, p’rhaps by some good soul,"
7556,IV.,He ne’er demurr’d but instantly forestole
7557,IV.,Their own anticipations with tenfold
7558,IV.,Th’ expected silver or expected gold;
7559,IV.,And to encourage the philanthropist—
7560,IV.,"If so invited—he would head the list,"

7563,IV.,"For some one dead, where were no means to pay;"
7564,IV.,Or to support the annual holiday;
7565,IV.,According as the question might arise:
7566,IV.,But should he e’er detect one in disguise
7567,IV.,Soliciting his alms and feigning poor
7568,IV.,He’d cast the wretch with vengeance from the door;

7644,VII.,Art thou so sad?” George wiped his tearful eye
7645,VII.,"And answered her:—“Ah! Gray, I’m back again,"
7646,VII.,But coming homeward four unholy men
7647,VII.,"Molested me and took my cash, and more—"
7648,VII.,The rogues decamp’d with all our weekly store.”
7649,VII.,Those words had scarce escaped poor George’s lips
7650,VII.,When he was struck with the advancing steps
7651,VII.,As of a horse (’twas now just nine o’clock)
7652,VII.,And then obedient to a hurried knock
7653,VII.,"The door was open’d, and a voice enquired"
7654,VII.,If master Hollybrand had yet retired
7655,VII.,"To rest. “Oh! no, Sir,” Gray replied, “he’s not.”"
7656,VII.,"“Will you be kind enough to say that Scott,[224]” * * *"
7657,VII.,George knew the voice and hasten’d to receive
7658,VII.,"The man of order, vengeance, or reprieve:"
7659,VII.,"He said. Now finding that the men were ta’en,"
7660,VII.,George felt reliev’d from an oppressive strain;
7661,VII.,"And on the following morning, by command,"
7662,VII.,"He went to prosecute th’ inhuman band,—"
7663,VII.,"He strode his pony at the hour of nine,"
7664,VII.,To be in attendance at th’ appointed time.
7665,VII.,"When near the place where they attack’d him, there"
7666,VII.,"George saw the fragments of some earthenware,—"
7667,VII.,"A portion of his stores,—which in their haste"
7668,VII.,The robbers had incautiously laid waste:
7669,VII.,"As may be well conceived—just at this spot,"
7670,VII.,"George ponder’d sadly o’er the direful plot,"
7671,VII.,But yet rejoiced to think what had befell
7672,VII.,The treacherous vagabonds at Ruttendell.[225]
7673,VII.,"So he proceeded, and, when he had gain’d"
7674,VII.,"The Justice’ Court, beheld all four arraign’d;"
7675,VII.,"Who, when they saw the prosecutor there,"
7676,VII.,Hung down their heads in deep and sad despair:
7677,VII.,"No doubt their hearts were wrung, and well they might"
7678,VII.,"When they observ’d their unpropitious plight,—"
7679,VII.,"Especially he who beckon’d on the rest,"
7680,VII.,And held the pistol straight to George’s breast:
7681,VII.,The one who had received a sabre-cut
7682,VII.,"Sat moaning piteously with eyes half shut,—"
7683,VII.,"For on his thigh the cutlass made a gash,"
7684,VII.,And struck the bone beneath an inch of flesh:
7685,VII.,"In years of youth the others seem’d to be,"
7686,VII.,Who had forsook the path of honesty—
7687,VII.,"Intent on mischief and misrule, but now"
7688,VII.,Remorse and horror sat upon their brow.
7689,VII.,God grant them mercy! but the law decreed
7690,VII.,That England of such demons should be freed;
7691,VII.,And so in time all four were sent away
7692,VII.,"To end their lifetime in old “Bot’ny Bay,”—"
7693,VII.,The merited reward of infamy.

7700,VIII.,VIII.
7701,VIII.,
7702,VIII.,"When Jane, as usual, took her Thursday tour,"
7703,VIII.,And reach’d the lodge about th’ eleventh hour—
7704,VIII.,A plan her loving temper had devised
7705,VIII.,For both their comfort—she was much surprised
7706,VIII.,"And much alarm’d—nay, felt a bit unwell"
7707,VIII.,When Gray epitomised the fraughtful tale;
7708,VIII.,But at the glad intelligence that they—
7709,VIII.,"The robbers—were secure in custody,"
7710,VIII.,Besides the message George had left behind
7711,VIII.,"To comfort and appease his daughter’s mind,"
7712,VIII.,"Her sorrow’d countenance lit up anew,"
7713,VIII.,Her placid cheeks regain’d their healthful hue;
7714,VIII.,And she became composed: yet the alloy—
7715,VIII.,Suspense combined with deep anxiety
7716,VIII.,(Those dubious moments which must intervene
7717,VIII.,"Before her father could reach home again),—"
7718,VIII.,"Compell’d poor Jane to shed a transient tear,"
7719,VIII.,And to extemporise a passing prayer.
7720,VIII.,"Some hours elapsed in this unenvied mood,"
7721,VIII.,"Till Martha’s warbler[226] (in its hall of wood),"
7722,VIII.,"Rang out its watchful note, as it was wont"
7723,VIII.,"Whenever any one approach’d the front,—"
7724,VIII.,And never fail’d save when the darksome night
7725,VIII.,"Would press its weight upon its tender sight,—"
7726,VIII.,"So Jane depended, and away she flew"
7727,VIII.,And found the pretty angel telling true:
7728,VIII.,"Wide swung the gate, and ere another breath"
7729,VIII.,"(Profound and solemn as the hour of death),"
7730,VIII.,"Jane clasp’d her father’s hand, and bade him say"
7731,VIII.,What were the fortunes of the current day.
7732,VIII.,He kiss’d her cheek and smilingly replied
7733,VIII.,"(Although emotion, for awhile, denied"
7734,VIII.,"His pregnant tongue)—“’Tis well, dear Jane, ’tis well!"
7735,VIII.,"Much sympathy prevails at Ruttendell,"
7736,VIII.,For this sad loss; but great shall be the praise
7737,VIII.,"To Him above, who hath prolong’d my days;"
7738,VIII.,For at one moment in that dreadful hour
7739,VIII.,"My pulse forsook its regulated pow’r,"
7740,VIII.,"And I, my dear, expected—sad to say—"
7741,VIII.,To have been launch’d into eternity!—
7742,VIII.,"Yes—thanks to God, whose providence disposed"
7743,VIII.,"The dreadful deed those horrid men proposed,"
7744,VIII.,"And prompted me, when life seem’d but a wave,"
7745,VIII.,To yield the substance of the villains’ crave.”
7746,VIII.,"George housed his pony, and return’d to “tea,”"
7747,VIII.,And pass’d this evening far more cheerfully
7748,VIII.,"Than the preceding one, and happily felt"
7749,VIII.,(At length) somewhat atoned by the result;
7750,VIII.,Nor was dear Jane less comforted than he
7751,VIII.,"For this escape from a calamity,—"
7752,VIII.,As such it would have been (I dare to state)
7753,VIII.,For some considerable time at Rollingate;
7754,VIII.,And whilst they liv’d time never could erase
7755,VIII.,Their recollection of the painful case.

7763,IX.,"Ceased for this evening to interrogate,"
7764,IX.,And bade them both a favourable good night;
7765,IX.,"Then hasten’d home, maturing as she went"
7766,IX.,The manner of depicting the event
7767,IX.,"To her dear aunt, and how t’explain away—"
7768,IX.,Without alarm—the cause of her delay;
7769,IX.,"Which she accomplishèd with praiseworthy tact,"
7770,IX.,"By slowly unfolding the momentous fact,—"
7771,IX.,And so unburden’d her invaded breast;
7772,IX.,Wept—but for joy—and then retired to rest.
7773,IX.,But many a day Jane felt (poor girl!) unfit
7774,IX.,"To undertake her lessons, and would sit"
7775,IX.,Apparently in fear lest aught should mar—
7776,IX.,By some catastrophe to him afar—
7777,IX.,"Her own anticipations, and destroy"
7778,IX.,Their mutual bodings of conjugal joy:
7779,IX.,"She’d read his letters (and give each a kiss),"
7780,IX.,"In which, alone, she found a world of bliss;"
7781,IX.,And oftentimes a tear would damp her face
7782,IX.,Whilst she replaced them in her writing-case.
7783,IX.,"On one occasion, when Jane heard the lark’s"
7784,IX.,"Blithe carolling, she made these sweet remarks—"
7785,IX.,"“Ah! little minstrel of the air so free,"
7786,IX.,None of thy kindred can discourse like thee;
7787,IX.,Whilst list’ning to thy solo—charming thing—
7788,IX.,I long to be a bird to choose thee king;
7789,IX.,"If so, I’d crown thee with pure wreaths of gold,"
7790,IX.,And then adventurously would make so bold
7791,IX.,"To claim thy friendship; yes, and seek thy love:"
7792,IX.,It may be thou art he that Arnold strove
7793,IX.,"One day so perseveringly to catch,"
7794,IX.,"But thou, O! songster, proved too good a match.”"
7795,IX.,"Another time, whilst sitting studiously"
7796,IX.,"Beneath the branches of a stately tree,"
7797,IX.,"The cuckoo ’lighted on its topmost limb,"
7798,IX.,"And, as his wont, his simple notes would chime"
7799,IX.,Melodiously; which fell upon Jane’s ear—
7800,IX.,"That, like a statue, she sat fix’d, for fear"
7801,IX.,"The slightest movement might affright her guest,"
7802,IX.,And thus disturb the darling’s transient rest:
7803,IX.,So much delighted was dear Jane to hear
7804,IX.,The meek enchanter piping forth so clear
7805,IX.,"Its rare alternate notes, that she could not"
7806,IX.,Refrain rememb’ring Westonbury cot:
7807,IX.,But when the cuckoo left its perch and fled
7808,IX.,"Across the vale, Jane lifted up her head,"
7809,IX.,"Exclaiming—“Oh, thou trumpeter of May!"
7810,IX.,"I’ve sat in pain, almost, that thou should’st stay,"
7811,IX.,"Yet thou hast flown; fie on thee, timid bird:”"
7812,IX.,But ere she’d time to speak another word
7813,IX.,"She, hearing footsteps as of something near,"
7814,IX.,"Turn’d quickly round and saw an antler’d deer,"
7815,IX.,"Of graceful form, the noblest of his race,"
7816,IX.,"Matchless in stature, and lord of the chase:"
7817,IX.,"Jane’s movements made the handsome creature bound,"
7818,IX.,"Light as an angel, o’er the scythèd ground:"
7819,IX.,"“Ah! nimble forester,” she said, “I see—"

7828,X.,"Brought tidings of increasing love for Jane,—"
7829,X.,"Entreating her, “Be constant; for my sake"
7830,X.,"Shun company,—at least, take care to make"
7831,X.,Acquaintance only with my choicest friends;
7832,X.,"Be chaste, for chastity with virtue blends:"

7835,X.,
7836,X.,*       *       *       *       *
7837,X.,And naturally felt—if half of this were truth—
7838,X.,"How clever would she ’ve been if, in her youth,"
7839,X.,She had been educated by degrees
7840,X.,At one of England’s best academies.
7841,X.,Now he began to contemplate with pride
7842,X.,A happy meeting with his future bride;
7843,X.,"He even fix’d the month, nay, very hour"
7844,X.,For setting out upon his homeward tour:
7845,X.,(And those acquainted with this noble man
7846,X.,Knew how precise he’d execute his plan:)—
7847,X.,"“Five silvery moons must run their course,” he said,"
7848,X.,“Before I take her to the nuptial bed;
7849,X.,"Day, godly flame, will fire the orient strand"

7851,X.,"Where, O, blest country—bounded by the sea,"

7866,XI.,"At length Jane Hollybrand, expectant, saw—"
7867,XI.,"Though to her sorrow, coming very slow’—"
7868,XI.,"The bumpkin postman, who appear’d intent"
7869,XI.,On solving some rude myst’ry as he went;
7870,XI.,"And then, as fate would have it, stopp’d to see"
7871,XI.,"If he could work it out ’rithmetic’lly,—"
7872,XI.,"Threw down his bag, regardless of its worth,"
7873,XI.,And sat himself upon dear Mother Earth;
7874,XI.,"There bask’d, as ’twere, full in old Horus’ eye,"
7875,XI.,"Whilst she, expecting him,[227] could almost cry—"
7876,XI.,"So sad was this suspense; but when he came,"
7877,XI.,The joy she felt relieved the man from blame.
7878,XI.,"Now her sweet features glowed with ruddy hue,"
7879,XI.,And as she read the letter through and through
7880,XI.,"She seem’d to pause at one particular place,"
7881,XI.,"And raised her handkerchief towards her face,—"
7882,XI.,"No doubt ’twas done t’obstruct the lucent tear,"
7883,XI.,Urged on perceiving that the time drew near
7884,XI.,"For her espousal, and that happy hour"
7885,XI.,"When love, unhamper’d, delegates its pow’r."
7886,XI.,’Mong other things (momentous as a whole)
7887,XI.,He gave instructions that the central-hall
7888,XI.,"Should be re-decorated, and elsewhere—"

7890,XI.,He lovingly express’d a great desire
7891,XI.,"That Jane, at once, should choose her own attire,—"
7892,XI.,"“Have every necessary thing,” he wrote, “complete"
7893,XI.,"Mind not the cost, my love, but be discreet;"
7894,XI.,"Bid dear Aunt Toogood do the same, and lo!"

7897,XI.,"Get each a suit, and neatly fitted on;—"
7898,XI.,"In fact, the servants all, each in their sphere,"
7899,XI.,Must on that day in wedding-garb appear:
7900,XI.,"And now, dear Jane, the last and not the least—"
7901,XI.,"Invite your father to the marriage-feast,—"
7902,XI.,"Tell him, my darling, I’ll require his aid,"

8066,IV.,
8067,IV.,When Arnold gain’d the summit of the hill
8068,IV.,"(Where stood the ruins of an ancient mill),[235]"
8069,IV.,"The last uprising on his homeward course,"
8070,IV.,"And where the village baker came for gorse,—"
8071,IV.,"Conveying it in paniers, on his horse"
8072,IV.,"(For in abundance on the hill it grew),"
8073,IV.,The turrets of his mansion ’rose to view:
8074,IV.,Then did his noble heart within him leap;
8075,IV.,"And when he first beheld the grazing sheep,"
8076,IV.,"In those prolific slopes, down in the vale"
8077,IV.,(Where many a hunter’s blast had rode the gale—
8078,IV.,"Whilst in pursuit of the despairing fox,"
8079,IV.,And where Sir Humphrey and Sir Edward Knox
8080,IV.,"Had often tried the mettle of their steeds,"
8081,IV.,"With Arnold’s father’s ——, ’cross those daisy-meads,"
8082,IV.,"And woodland-acres, and yon distant Down,"
8083,IV.,Where nimble Reynards for their lives had flown);
8084,IV.,Then did Lord Arnold picture to his mind
8085,IV.,"His lovely Jane, so beautiful and kind."
8086,IV.,But yet he had to traverse o’er a mile
8087,IV.,"Before he could behold the beam, the smile,"
8088,IV.,The tender tear of joy; and hear that voice
8089,IV.,Articulate the language of his choice:—
8090,IV.,"“Ah! Slash,”[236] he said, “I see the pale-blue smoke,"
8091,IV.,"From the Lodge-chimney, ’scending through the oak.”"
8092,IV.,"Five minutes more, the horses gently swerve,"
8093,IV.,"And canter gracefully, around the curve,"
8094,IV.,"Through the Lodge-gateway; there stood Hollybrand,"
8095,IV.,"As meek as ever, with his hat in hand:"
8096,IV.,"Arnold saluted him with right good will,—"
8097,IV.,“I’d hoped to ’ve seen you in at Ruttendell;
8098,IV.,"How is it, George, you were not there to-day,"
8099,IV.,"Astride your pony, with my tenantry?”"
8100,IV.,"George modestly replied—“I thought, good Sir,"
8101,IV.,My greatest comfort would be first to hear
8102,IV.,Thy welcome voice near to my sacred home!”
8103,IV.,"“And are you happy?” “Yes,” he said. “Then come,"
8104,IV.,"Secure the gate, and make your dwelling right;"
8105,IV.,And spend an hour with us at home to-night.”

8114,V.,"Up on a hill, about three furlongs off,"
8115,V.,The stable-boy (not far from being a dwarf)
8116,V.,"Was sent by Jane, and caution’d how to raise"
8117,V.,"And wave on high a strip of scarlet baize,"
8118,V.,So soon as he beheld his master’s chaise.
8119,V.,"(A beacon-signal to the anxious Jane,"
8120,V.,Whilst she sat peeping through the window pane;
8121,V.,For on this hill a distant view arose
8122,V.,"Of the high-road, ’long which the traveller goes"
8123,V.,When journeying to and fro near Ruttendell.)
8124,V.,Jane saw the streamer rais’d! then knew full well
8125,V.,Her lover soon would be within her sight;
8126,V.,"She wept for joy, so great was her delight."
8127,V.,The south-west breeze bore up the greenwood vale
8128,V.,"The chaise’s rattle,—thanks to the sweet gale:"
8129,V.,An instant more the whistling whip was heard:
8130,V.,"Jane look’d, and lo! across the grassy sward"
8131,V.,She saw the moving mass advancing swift;—
8132,V.,No longer of her love is she bereft!
8133,V.,(Dear Mistress Toogood fired her aged breast;
8134,V.,"And, venturing forth to meet the lordly guest"
8135,V.,"Beneath the portico,—dress, “bishop-sleeved,”—"
8136,V.,Bestowed her saintly blessings; thus relieved
8137,V.,Her dear old heart of two years’ sobs and sighs;
8138,V.,"Yet even then she scarce believed her eyes,"
8139,V.,For seventy years and five had made them dim;
8140,V.,But when she heard his voice she knew ’twas him!)

8142,V.,
8143,VI.,VI.
8144,VI.,
8145,VI.,On came the carriage: Arnold drops the reins;
8146,VI.,"Descends, and instantly his love entwines—"
8147,VI.,Dumb with emotion at his kind embrace.
8148,VI.,"Whilst gentle drops stole down Jane’s blushing face,"
8149,VI.,"Lord Arnold’s own bright eyes, keen to behold,"
8150,VI.,’Came dimm’d with joy: yes! could he but have told
8151,VI.,"One half the feelings wrought upon his heart,"
8152,VI.,Not even then a tithe could he impart:
8153,VI.,"He saw, at once, her tutors, when they wrote,"
8154,VI.,Had partially concealed how they were smote;—
8155,VI.,"Not, as he naturally might have inferr’d—"
8156,VI.,"That they’d contriv’d to please him, and conferr’d"
8157,VI.,"One with another: no, this wasn’t the case,"
8158,VI.,For he beheld her now endowed with grace;
8159,VI.,Her comeliness and rare symmetral form
8160,VI.,"Surpass’d his hope, and ’flam’d his bosom warm."
8161,VI.,"Recovering from this reverie of bliss,"
8162,VI.,Jane spoke in silvery tones; her tale was this—
8163,VI.,"“I’ve learn’d to love thee, in thy absence, dear;"
8164,VI.,"Pray pardon me, if now I love thee here;”"
8165,VI.,"So placed her hand immediately in his,"
8166,VI.,And seal’d his lips with her first earnest kiss.
8167,VI.,"Arnold, in raptures with this stroke of love,"
8168,VI.,Glimpsed her two joys; and envied not high Jove!
8169,VI.,
8170,VI.,
8171,VII.,VII.
8172,VII.,
8173,VII.,"At eight o’clock, Jane’s father had arrived:"
8174,VII.,"With all his power he zealously contrived,"
8175,VII.,"But fail’d, to be excused from the repast;"
8176,VII.,"And therefore, being prevail’d upon at last,"
8177,VII.,"He dined, for the first time, with his good lord;"
8178,VII.,Dear Jane assisting him with her kind word.
8179,VII.,"(’Twas now too late for Toogood to be there,"
8180,VII.,As habit had compell’d her to repair
8181,VII.,"Unto her bedroom, for the night’s repose.)"
8182,VII.,"The cloth remov’d, Lord Arnold, quite jocose,"
8183,VII.,"Related one of his adventurous tales,"
8184,VII.,In which the plunder of some foreign mails
8185,VII.,Form’d part the story: Jane felt much amused;
8186,VII.,But Hollybrand himself appear’d confused;
8187,VII.,"As though assured, by its similitude,"
8188,VII.,His own mishap was really understood:
8189,VII.,"Then Arnold, in his wonted happy mood,"
8190,VII.,"Perceiving Hollybrand confounded, smil’d,"
8191,VII.,And said to George: “It is your own dear child
8192,VII.,Who sent me tidings of that dread affair;
8193,VII.,"I’ll lay a wager, George, you’ve taken care,"
8194,VII.,"When going to town upon a market-day,"
8195,VII.,To guard against a similar affray!”
8196,VII.,"“Yes, yes,” said George, with smiling countenance,"
8197,VII.,"“You may depend, dear sir, I’ve ever since"
8198,VII.,Ta’en this precaution—never more to start
8199,VII.,"To Ruttendell, alone, with horse and cart.”"
8200,VII.,"Then Arnold, after this tale, told in jest,"
8201,VII.,"Touch’d on the subject which his heart lov’d best,—"
8202,VII.,Of making dearest Jane his loving wife;
8203,VII.,"“On whom,” he said, “depends my love of life.”"
8204,VII.,
8205,VII.,
8206,VIII.,VIII.
8207,VIII.,
8208,VIII.,A serious conversation then ensued—
8209,VIII.,The retrospect and future well reviewed—
8210,VIII.,Lord Arnold delicately sought to name
8211,VIII.,"The nuptial-day, and urg’d the blushing Jane"
8212,VIII.,"To fix the date; but she, with subdued voice,"
8213,VIII.,"Begg’d courteously to be excused,—“the choice,”"
8214,VIII.,"She softly said, “dear Arnold, should be thine;"
8215,VIII.,"And what your wish may be, that shall be mine.”"
8216,VIII.,"He then, most fondly, kiss’d her modest cheek,"
8217,VIII.,And named it for the following Wednesday-week:
8218,VIII.,"“Shall it be so?” he said * * * “come, dear, express"
8219,VIII.,"Thy pleasure, and enhance my happiness!”"
8220,VIII.,"She press’d his hand, and breathed the mono-word[237]"
8221,VIII.,To which George Hollybrand at once concurred:
8222,VIII.,"And silently pour’d forth this orison,—"
8223,VIII.,"“O righteous God, bless Thou this gen’rous man!”"
8224,VIII.,
8225,VIII.,[237] Yes!
8226,VIII.,
8227,VIII.,
8228,IX.,IX.
8229,IX.,
8230,IX.,"Sleep’s slumbering influence now began to fall,"
8231,IX.,"And Arnold must have felt it most of all,—"
8232,IX.,The day had been a double-day to him;
8233,IX.,His dark blue eye had lost its sparkling beam
8234,IX.,"(And only those who pass through similar scenes,—"
8235,IX.,"Who are the objects of such welcomin’s,—"
8236,IX.,"Can comprehend one half th’ attendant pain,"
8237,IX.,Extreme of pleasure forces on the brain).
8238,IX.,Night now had enter’d in th’ eleventh hour.
8239,IX.,The sun was on his antipodal tour;
8240,IX.,"But heav’n was not forsaken by its queen,"
8241,IX.,For she was silv’ring o’er th’ expansive green;[238]
8242,IX.,"With all her wonted grace she shed her rays,"
8243,IX.,"And number’d this as one of her bright days,"
8244,IX.,"She lit the path, in which George had to roam,"
8245,IX.,"That he, in safety, might regain his home:"
8246,IX.,"Each other bade adieu, George homeward sped;"
8247,IX.,And Arnold Mountjoy sought his lonely bed.
8248,IX.,"(Twelve other nights, he[239] knew, must be bygone,—"
8249,IX.,"Twelve other suns must cross the temperate zone,—"
8250,IX.,Ere her[240] virginity—which by the law
8251,IX.,Is reckon’d sacred—shall be broken through.)
8252,IX.,Jane had retir’d; her evening pray’rs were flown;
8253,IX.,A snow white pillow form’d her peaceful crown.
8254,IX.,The night was still; all Nature seem’d to lull;
8255,IX.,"And God, alone, the guardian of the hall!"
8256,IX.,"Thus closed a day, one of unusual mirth,—"
