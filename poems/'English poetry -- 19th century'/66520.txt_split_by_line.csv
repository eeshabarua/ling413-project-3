421,I.,
422,I.,We glide by many a lanterned mast;

481,II.,He hungered for his home.
482,II.,
483,II.,"These northern waves, these island airs!"
484,II.,Dreams of these haunted his full heart:

486,II.,Bidding him play his part.
487,II.,
488,II.,The freedom of the living dead;

1037,GWYNEDD.,
1038,GWYNEDD.,"The children of the mingling mists: can they,"
1039,GWYNEDD.,"Born by the melancholy hills, love thee,"
1040,GWYNEDD.,"Royal and joyous light?  From dawn of day,"
1041,GWYNEDD.,"We watch the trailing shadows of the waste,"
1042,GWYNEDD.,"The waste moors, or the ever-mourning sea:"
1043,GWYNEDD.,"What, though in speedy splendour thou hast raced"
1044,GWYNEDD.,"Over the heather or wild wave, a ray"
1045,GWYNEDD.,Of travelling glory and swift bloom?  Still thou
1046,GWYNEDD.,Inhabitest the mighty morning's brow:
1047,GWYNEDD.,"And hast thy flaming and celestial way,"
1048,GWYNEDD.,"Afar from our sad beauties, in thine haste."
1049,GWYNEDD.,
1050,GWYNEDD.,"Have thou thy circling triumph of the skies,"
1051,GWYNEDD.,Horseman of Goldwhite Footsteps!  Yet all fire
1052,GWYNEDD.,"Lives not with thee: for part is in our eyes,"
1053,GWYNEDD.,Beholding the loved beauty of cold hills:
1054,GWYNEDD.,"And part is patron of dear home desire,"
1055,GWYNEDD.,Flashing upon the central hearth: it fills
1056,GWYNEDD.,"Ingle and black-benched nook with radiances,"
1057,GWYNEDD.,"Hearts with responding spirit, ears with deep"
1058,GWYNEDD.,"Delicious music of the ruddy leap,"
1059,GWYNEDD.,"And streaming strength, and kindling confluences:"
1060,GWYNEDD.,"The hearth glows, and the cavernous chimney thrills,"
1061,GWYNEDD.,
1062,GWYNEDD.,"Pale with great heat, panting to crimson gloom,"
1063,GWYNEDD.,Quiver the deeps of the rich fire: see there!
1064,GWYNEDD.,"Was not that your fair face, in burning bloom"
1065,GWYNEDD.,Wrought by the art of fire?  O happy art!
1066,GWYNEDD.,That sets in living flames a face so fair:
1067,GWYNEDD.,"The face, whose changes dominate mine heart,"
1068,GWYNEDD.,And with a look speak my delight or doom:
1069,GWYNEDD.,"Nay, now not doom, for I am only thine,"
1070,GWYNEDD.,And one in thee and me the fire divine!
1071,GWYNEDD.,"The fire, that wants the whole vast world for room:"
1072,GWYNEDD.,Yet dwells in us contented and apart.
1073,GWYNEDD.,
1074,GWYNEDD.,The flames' red dance is done: and we crouch close
1075,GWYNEDD.,"With shadowy faces to the dull, red glow."

1079,GWYNEDD.,"And now one tongue of flame leaps up aloft,"
1080,GWYNEDD.,"Brightening your brows: and now it fails, and throws"
1081,GWYNEDD.,"A play of flushing shadows, the rich mist"
1082,GWYNEDD.,"Of purple grapes, that many a sun hath kissed;"
1083,GWYNEDD.,"The delicate darkness, that with autumn grows"
1084,GWYNEDD.,On red ripe apples in a mossy croft.
1085,GWYNEDD.,
1086,GWYNEDD.,"Nay! leave such idle southern imageries,"
1087,GWYNEDD.,"Vineyard and orchard, flowers and mellow fruit:"
1088,GWYNEDD.,Great store is ours of mountain mysteries.
1089,GWYNEDD.,"Look, where the embers fade, from ruddy gold"
1090,GWYNEDD.,Into gray ashes falling without bruit!
1091,GWYNEDD.,"Yet is that ruddy lustre bought and sold,"
1092,GWYNEDD.,Elf with elf trafficking his merchandise:
1093,GWYNEDD.,"Deep at the strong foot of the eagles' pass,"
1094,GWYNEDD.,"They store the haunting treasure, and amass"

1097,GWYNEDD.,
1098,GWYNEDD.,"Across the moor, over the purple bells,"

1102,GWYNEDD.,"Great good it is to see, how beauty thrives"
1103,GWYNEDD.,For desolate moorland and for moorland men;
1104,GWYNEDD.,"To smell scents, rarer than soft honey cells,"
1105,GWYNEDD.,"From bruised wild thyme, pine bark, or mouldering peat;"
1106,GWYNEDD.,"To watch the crawling gray clouds drift, and meet"
1107,GWYNEDD.,"Midway the ragged cliffs.  O mountain spells,"
1108,GWYNEDD.,"Calling us forth, by hill, and moor, and glen!"
1109,GWYNEDD.,
1110,GWYNEDD.,"Calling us forth, to be with earth again,"
1111,GWYNEDD.,"Her memories, her splendours, her desires!"
1112,GWYNEDD.,The fires of the hearth are fallen: now the rain
1113,GWYNEDD.,"Stirs its delight of waters, as the flame"
1114,GWYNEDD.,Stirred its delight of heat and spirited fires.
1115,GWYNEDD.,"Come! by the lintel listen: clouds proclaim,"
1116,GWYNEDD.,"That thunder is their vast voice: the winds wane,"
1117,GWYNEDD.,"That all the storm may gather strength, and strive"
1118,GWYNEDD.,Once more in their great breath to be alive;
1119,GWYNEDD.,"And fill the angry air with such a strain,"
1120,GWYNEDD.,"As filled the world's war, when the world first came."
1121,GWYNEDD.,
1122,GWYNEDD.,"Desolate Cornwall, desolate Brittany,"
1123,GWYNEDD.,Are up in vehement wind and vehement wave:
1124,GWYNEDD.,"Ancient delights are on their ancient sea,"
1125,GWYNEDD.,And nature's violent graces waken there;
1126,GWYNEDD.,"And there goes loveliness about the grave,"
1127,GWYNEDD.,"And death means dreaming, not life's long despair."
1128,GWYNEDD.,"Our sister lands are they, one people we,"
1129,GWYNEDD.,"Cornwall desolate, Brittany desolate,"
1130,GWYNEDD.,And Wales: to us is granted to be great:
1131,GWYNEDD.,"Because, as winds and seas and flames are free,"
1132,GWYNEDD.,"We too have freedom full, as wild and rare."
1133,GWYNEDD.,
1134,GWYNEDD.,"And therefore, on a night of heavenly fires;"
1135,GWYNEDD.,"And therefore, on a windy hour of noon;"
1136,GWYNEDD.,"Our soul, like nature's eager soul, aspires,"
1137,GWYNEDD.,Finding all thunders and all winds our friends:
1138,GWYNEDD.,"And like the moving sea, love we the moon;"
1139,GWYNEDD.,"And life in us the way of nature wends,"
1140,GWYNEDD.,"Ardent as nature's own, that never tires."
1141,GWYNEDD.,"Born of wild land, children of mountains, we"
1142,GWYNEDD.,"Fear neither ruining earth, nor stormy sea:"
1143,GWYNEDD.,"Even as men told in Athens, of our sires:"
1144,GWYNEDD.,"And as it shall be, till the old world ends."
1145,GWYNEDD.,
1146,GWYNEDD.,"Your eyes but brighten to the streaming wind,"
1147,GWYNEDD.,"But lighten to the sighing air, but break"
1148,GWYNEDD.,To tears before the labouring hills: your mind
1149,GWYNEDD.,Moves with the passionate spirit of the land.
1150,GWYNEDD.,"Now crystal is your soul, now flame: a lake,"
1151,GWYNEDD.,"Proud and calm, with high scaurs on either hand;"
1152,GWYNEDD.,"Or a swift lance of lightning, to strike blind."
1153,GWYNEDD.,"True child of Gwynedd, child of wilds and fields!"
1154,GWYNEDD.,"To you earth clings, to you strange nature yields"
1155,GWYNEDD.,"Far learning, sudden light, fierce fire: these find"
1156,GWYNEDD.,"Home in your heart, and thoughts that understand."
1157,GWYNEDD.,
1158,GWYNEDD.,We will not wander from this land; we will
1159,GWYNEDD.,"Be wise together, and accept our world:"
1160,GWYNEDD.,"This world of the gray cottage by the hill,"
1161,GWYNEDD.,"This gorge, this lusty air, this loneliness:"
1162,GWYNEDD.,The calm of drifting clouds; the pine-tops whirled
1163,GWYNEDD.,And swayed along the ridges.  Here distress
1164,GWYNEDD.,"Dreams, and delight dreams: dreaming, we can fill"
1165,GWYNEDD.,"All solitary haunts with prophecy,"
1166,GWYNEDD.,All heights with holiness and mystery;
1167,GWYNEDD.,"Our hearts with understanding, and our will"
1168,GWYNEDD.,With love of nature's law and loveliness.
1169,GWYNEDD.,
1170,GWYNEDD.,"Old voices call, old pleasures lure: for now"
1171,GWYNEDD.,The wet earth breathes ancient fair fragrance forth;
1172,GWYNEDD.,"And dying gales hang in the branches, blow"
1173,GWYNEDD.,"And fall, and blow again: our widest home"
1174,GWYNEDD.,"Is with rich winds of West, loud winds of North,"
1175,GWYNEDD.,Sweeping beneath a gray and vasty dome.
1176,GWYNEDD.,"Not with the hearth, whose consolations go,"
1177,GWYNEDD.,Our home of homes: but where our eyes grown tired
1178,GWYNEDD.,"Of straitened joys, with stretching joys are fired:"
1179,GWYNEDD.,"Joys of the rolling moor and cloudy brow,"
1180,GWYNEDD.,"Or worn, precipitous bastions of the foam."
1181,GWYNEDD.,
1182,GWYNEDD.,"Our fires are fallen from their blossoming height,"
1183,GWYNEDD.,And linger in sad embers: but gray bloom

1186,GWYNEDD.,"Falls on our hearts, through eve and gentle gloom,"
1187,GWYNEDD.,More than upon our foreheads.  The world's pain
1188,GWYNEDD.,"And joy of storm are proven our delight,"
1189,GWYNEDD.,"And peace enthroned for ever: ours the mirth,"
1190,GWYNEDD.,And melancholy of this ancient earth:

1202,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1203,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Merry the night, you riders of the wild!"
1204,A CORNISH NIGHT.,A merry night to ride your wilderness.
1205,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Come you from visionary haunts, enisled"
1206,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Amid the northern waters pitiless,"
1207,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Over these cliffs white-heathered?  Upon mild
1208,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Midnights of dewy June, oh, rare to press"
1209,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Past moonlit fields of white bean-flowers! nor less
1210,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"To wander beside falling waves, beguiled"
1211,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"By soft winds into still dreams!  Yet confess,"
1212,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"You chivalries of air, unreconciled"
1213,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"To the warm, breathing world! what ghostly stress"
1214,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Compels your visit unto sorrow's child?
1215,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1216,A CORNISH NIGHT.,What would you here?  For here you have no part:
1217,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Only the sad voices of wind and sea
1218,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Are prophets here to any wistful heart:
1219,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Or white flowers found upon a glimmering lea.
1220,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"What would you here?  Sweep onward, and depart"
1221,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Over the ocean into Brittany,"
1222,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Where old faith is, and older mystery!"
1223,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Though this be western land, we have no art"
1224,A CORNISH NIGHT.,To welcome spirits in community:
1225,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Trafficking, in an high celestial mart,"
1226,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Slumber for wondrous knowledge: setting free
1227,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Our souls, that strain and agonize and start."
1228,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1229,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"The wind hath cried to me, all the long day,"
1230,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"That you were coming, chivalries of air!"
1231,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Between the waters and the starry way.
1232,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Fair lies the sea about a land, as fair:"
1233,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Moonlight and west winds move upon the bay
1234,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Gently: now down the rough path sweet it were
1235,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"To clamber, and so launching out to fare"
1236,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Forth for the heart of sea and night, away"
1237,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"From hard earth's loud uproar, and harder care!"
1238,A CORNISH NIGHT.,But you at will about the winds can stray:
1239,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Or bid the wandering stars of midnight bear
1240,A CORNISH NIGHT.,You company: or with the seven stay.
1241,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1242,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"And yet you came for me!  So the wind cried,"
1243,A CORNISH NIGHT.,So my soul knows: else why am I awake

1245,A CORNISH NIGHT.,The soothed sea's murmuring nocturnal lake?
1246,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Not sleep, but storm, welcomes a widowed bride:"
1247,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Storms of sad certainty, vain want, that make"
1248,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Vigil perpetual mine; so that I take
1249,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"The gusty night in place of him, who died,"
1250,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"To clasp me home to heart.  That cannot break,"
1251,A CORNISH NIGHT.,The eternal heart of nature far and wide!

1254,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1255,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"So now, your message!  Breathe words from the wave,"
1256,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Or breathe words from the field, into mine ears:"
1257,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Or from the sleeping shades of a cold grave
1258,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Bring comfortable solace for my tears.
1259,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Something of my love's heart could nature save:
1260,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Some rich delight to spice the tasteless years,"
1261,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Some hope to light the valley of lone fears.
1262,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Hear!  I am left alone, to bear and brave"
1263,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"The sounding storms: but you, from starry spheres,"
1264,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"From wild wood haunts, give me, as love once gave"
1265,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Joy from his home celestial, so, love's peers!"
1266,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Give peace awhile to me, sorrow's poor slave!"
1267,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1268,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"In sorrow's order I dwell passionist,"
1269,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Cloistered by tossing sea on weary land.
1270,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"O vain love! vain, to claim me votarist:"
1271,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"O vain my heart! that will not understand,"
1272,A CORNISH NIGHT.,_He is dead!  I am lonely!_  Love in a Mist
1273,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"My flower is: and salt tangle of the strand,"
1274,A CORNISH NIGHT.,The crownals woven by this failing hand:
1275,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"In the dark kingdom, walking where I list,"
1276,A CORNISH NIGHT.,I walk where Lethe glides against the sand.
1277,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"But vain love is a constant lutanist,"
1278,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Playing old airs, and able to withstand"
1279,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Sweet sleep: vain love, thou loyal melodist!"
1280,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1281,A CORNISH NIGHT.,You wanderers!  Would I were wandering
1282,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Under the white moon with you, or among"
1283,A CORNISH NIGHT.,The invisible stars with you!  Would I might sing
1284,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Over the charmed sea your enchaunting song,"
1285,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Song of old autumn, and of radiant spring:"
1286,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Might sing, how earth the mother suffers long;"
1287,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"How the great winds are wild, yet do no wrong;"
1288,A CORNISH NIGHT.,How the most frail bloom is at heart a king!
1289,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"I could endure then, strenuous and strong:"
1290,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"But now, O spirits of the air!  I bring"
1291,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Before you my waste soul: why will you throng
1292,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"About me, save to take even such a thing?"
1293,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1294,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Only for this you ride the midnight gloom,"
1295,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Above the ancient isles of the old main.
1296,A CORNISH NIGHT.,The spray leaps on the hidden rocks of doom:
1297,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"The ripples break, and wail away again"
1298,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Upon the gathering wave: gaunt headlands loom
1299,A CORNISH NIGHT.,In the lone distance of the heaving plain.
1300,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"And now, until the calm, the still stars wane,"
1301,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"You wait upon my heart, my heart a tomb."
1302,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Though I dream, life and dreams are alike vain!"
1303,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Then love me, tell me news of dear death: whom"
1304,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Circle you, but a soul astray, one fain"
1305,A CORNISH NIGHT.,To leave this close world for death's larger room?
1306,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1307,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"If barren be the promise I desire,"
1308,A CORNISH NIGHT.,The promise that I shall not always go
1309,A CORNISH NIGHT.,In living solitariness: break fire
1310,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Out of the night, and lay me swiftly low!"
1311,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Soft spirits! you have wings to waft me higher,"
1312,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Than touch of each my most familiar woe:
1313,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Am I unworthy, you should raise me so?"
1314,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"If barren be that trust, my dreams inspire"
1315,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Only despair; my brooding heart must grow
1316,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Heavy with miseries; a mourning quire,"
1317,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"To tell the heavy hours, how sad, how slow,"
1318,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Are all their footsteps, of whose sound I tire."
1319,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1320,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Bright seafire runs about a plunging keel
1321,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"On vehement nights: and where black danger lies,"
1322,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Gleam the torn breakers.  But all days reveal
1323,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Drear dooms for me, nor any nights disguise"
1324,A CORNISH NIGHT.,Their menace: never rolls the thunder peal
1325,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Through my worn watch, nor lightning past mine eyes"
1326,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Leaps from the blue gloom of its mother skies,"
1327,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"One hour alone, but all, while sad stars wheel."
1328,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"This hour, was it a lie, that bade me rise;"
1329,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Some laughing dream, that whispered me to steal"
1330,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Into the sea-sweet night, where the wind cries,"
1331,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"And find the comfort, that I cannot feel?"
1332,A CORNISH NIGHT.,
1333,A CORNISH NIGHT.,My lord hath gone your way perpetual:
1334,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Whether you be great spirits of the dead,"
1335,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Or spirits you, that never were in thrall"
1336,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"To perishing bodies, dust-born, dustward led."
1337,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Sweet shadows! passing by this ocean wall,"
1338,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Tarry to pour some balm upon mine head,"
1339,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"Some pity for a woman, who hath wed"
1340,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"With weariness and loneliness, from fall"
1341,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"To fall, from bitter snows to maybloom red:"
1342,A CORNISH NIGHT.,"The hayfields hear, the cornlands hear, my call!"
