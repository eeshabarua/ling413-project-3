19,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
20,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"[213] THE ""aesthetic"" poetry is neither a mere reproduction of Greek"
21,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"or medieval poetry, nor only an idealisation of modern life and"
22,WALTER HORATIO PATER,sentiment.  The atmosphere on which its effect depends belongs to no
23,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"simple form of poetry, no actual form of life.  Greek poetry,"
24,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"medieval or modern poetry, projects, above the realities of its time,"
25,WALTER HORATIO PATER,a world in which the forms of things are transfigured.  Of that
26,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"transfigured world this new poetry takes possession, and sublimates"
27,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"beyond it another still fainter and more spectral, which is literally"
28,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"an artificial or ""earthly paradise.""  It is a finer ideal, extracted"
29,WALTER HORATIO PATER,from what in relation to any actual world is already an ideal.  Like
30,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"some strange second flowering after date, it renews on a more"
31,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"delicate type the poetry of a past age, but must not be confounded"
32,WALTER HORATIO PATER,with it.  The secret of the enjoyment of it is that inversion of
33,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"home-sickness known to some, that incurable thirst for the sense of"
34,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"escape, which no actual form of life [214] satisfies, no poetry even,"
35,WALTER HORATIO PATER,if it be merely simple and spontaneous.
36,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
37,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"The writings of the ""romantic school,"" of which the aesthetic poetry"
38,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"is an afterthought, mark a transition not so much from the pagan to"
39,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"the medieval ideal, as from a lower to a higher degree of passion in"
40,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"literature.  The end of the eighteenth century, swept by vast"
41,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"disturbing currents, experienced an excitement of spirit of which one"
42,WALTER HORATIO PATER,note was a reaction against an outworn classicism severed not more
43,WALTER HORATIO PATER,from nature than from the genuine motives of ancient art; and a
44,WALTER HORATIO PATER,return to true Hellenism was as much a part of this reaction as the
45,WALTER HORATIO PATER,sudden preoccupation with things medieval.  The medieval tendency is
46,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"in Goethe's Goetz von Berlichingen, the Hellenic in his Iphigenie."
47,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"At first this medievalism was superficial, or at least external."
48,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Adventure, romance in the frankest sense, grotesque individualism--that"
49,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"is one element in medieval poetry, and with it alone Scott and"
50,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Goethe dealt.  Beyond them were the two other elements of the
51,WALTER HORATIO PATER,medieval spirit: its mystic religion at its apex in Dante and Saint
52,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Louis, and its mystic passion, passing here and there into the great"
53,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"romantic loves of rebellious flesh, of Lancelot and Abelard.  That"
54,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"stricter, imaginative medievalism which re-creates the mind of the"
55,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Middle Age, so that the form, the presentment grows outward [215]"
56,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"from within, came later with Victor Hugo in France, with Heine in"
57,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Germany.
58,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
59,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"In the Defence of Guenevere: and Other Poems, published by Mr."
60,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"William Morris now many years ago, the first typical specimen of"
61,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"aesthetic poetry, we have a refinement upon this later, profounder"
62,WALTER HORATIO PATER,medievalism.  The poem which gives its name to the volume is a thing
63,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"tormented and awry with passion, like the body of Guenevere defending"
64,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"herself from the charge of adultery, and the accent falls in strange,"
65,WALTER HORATIO PATER,unwonted places with the effect of a great cry.  In truth these
66,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Arthurian legends, in their origin prior to Christianity, yield all"
67,WALTER HORATIO PATER,their sweetness only in a Christian atmosphere.  What is
68,WALTER HORATIO PATER,characteristic in them is the strange suggestion of a deliberate
69,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"choice between Christ and a rival lover.  That religion, monastic"
70,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"religion at any rate, has its sensuous side, a dangerously sensuous"
71,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"side, has been often seen: it is the experience of Rousseau as well"
72,WALTER HORATIO PATER,as of the Christian mystics.  The Christianity of the Middle Age made
73,WALTER HORATIO PATER,way among a people whose loss was in the life of the senses partly by
74,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"its aesthetic beauty, a thing so profoundly felt by the Latin"
75,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"hymn-writers, who for one moral or spiritual sentiment have a hundred"
76,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"sensuous images.  And so in those imaginative loves, in their highest"
77,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"expression, the Provencal poetry, it is a rival religion with a [216]"
78,WALTER HORATIO PATER,new rival cultus that we see.  Coloured through and through with
79,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Christian sentiment, they are rebels against it.  The rejection of"
80,WALTER HORATIO PATER,one worship for another is never lost sight of.  The jealousy of that
81,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"other lover, for whom these words and images and refined ways of"
82,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"sentiment were first devised, is the secret here of a borrowed,"
83,WALTER HORATIO PATER,perhaps factitious colour and heat.  It is the mood of the cloister
84,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"taking a new direction, and winning so a later space of life it never"
85,WALTER HORATIO PATER,anticipated.
86,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
87,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Hereon, as before in the cloister, so now in the chateau, the reign"
88,WALTER HORATIO PATER,of reverie set in.  The devotion of the cloister knew that mood
89,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"thoroughly, and had sounded all its stops.  For the object of this"
90,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"devotion was absent or veiled, not limited to one supreme plastic"
91,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"form like Zeus at Olympia or Athena in the Acropolis, but distracted,"
92,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"as in a fever dream, into a thousand symbols and reflections.  But"
93,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"then, the Church, that new Sibyl, had a thousand secrets to make the"
94,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"absent near.  Into this kingdom of reverie, and with it into a"
95,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"paradise of ambitious refinements, the earthly love enters, and"
96,WALTER HORATIO PATER,becomes a prolonged somnambulism.  Of religion it learns the art of
97,WALTER HORATIO PATER,directing towards an unseen object sentiments whose natural direction
98,WALTER HORATIO PATER,is towards objects of sense.  Hence a love defined by the absence of
99,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"the beloved, choosing to be without hope, protesting [217] against"
100,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"all lower uses of love, barren, extravagant, antinomian.  It is the"
101,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"love which is incompatible with marriage, for the chevalier who never"
102,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"comes, of the serf for the chatelaine, of the rose for the"
103,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"nightingale, of Rudel for the Lady of Tripoli.  Another element of"
104,WALTER HORATIO PATER,extravagance came in with the feudal spirit: Provencal love is full
105,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"of the very forms of vassalage.  To be the servant of love, to have"
106,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"offended, to taste the subtle luxury of chastisement, of"
107,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"reconciliation--the religious spirit, too, knows that, and meets just"
108,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"there, as in Rousseau, the delicacies of the earthly love.  Here,"
109,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"under this strange complex of conditions, as in some medicated air,"
110,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"exotic flowers of sentiment expand, among people of a remote and"
111,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"unaccustomed beauty, somnambulistic, frail, androgynous, the light"
112,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"almost shining through them.  Surely, such loves were too fragile and"
113,WALTER HORATIO PATER,adventurous to last more than for a moment.
114,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
115,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"That monastic religion of the Middle Age was, in fact, in many of its"
116,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"bearings, like a beautiful disease or disorder of the senses: and a"
117,WALTER HORATIO PATER,religion which is a disorder of the senses must always be subject to
118,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"illusions.  Reverie, illusion, delirium: they are the three stages of"
119,WALTER HORATIO PATER,a fatal descent both in the religion and the loves of the Middle Age.
120,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Nowhere has the impression of this delirium been conveyed as by
121,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Victor Hugo in Notre Dame de Paris.  The [218] strangest creations of
122,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"sleep seem here, by some appalling licence, to cross the limit of the"
123,WALTER HORATIO PATER,dawn.  The English poet too has learned the secret.  He has diffused
124,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"through King Arthur's Tomb the maddening white glare of the sun, and"
125,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"tyranny of the moon, not tender and far-off, but close down--the"
126,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"sorcerer's moon, large and feverish.  The colouring is intricate and"
127,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"delirious, as of ""scarlet lilies.""  The influence of summer is like a"
128,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"poison in one's blood, with a sudden bewildered sickening of life and"
129,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"all things.  In Galahad: a Mystery, the frost of Christmas night on"
130,WALTER HORATIO PATER,the chapel stones acts as a strong narcotic: a sudden shrill ringing
131,WALTER HORATIO PATER,pierces through the numbness: a voice proclaims that the Grail has
132,WALTER HORATIO PATER,gone forth through the great forest.  It is in the Blue Closet that
133,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"this delirium reaches its height with a singular beauty, reserved"
134,WALTER HORATIO PATER,perhaps for the enjoyment of the few.
135,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
136,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"A passion of which the outlets are sealed, begets a tension of nerve,"
137,WALTER HORATIO PATER,in which the sensible world comes to one with a reinforced brilliancy
138,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"and relief--all redness is turned into blood, all water into tears."
139,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Hence a wild, convulsed sensuousness in the poetry of the Middle Age,"
140,WALTER HORATIO PATER,in which the things of nature begin to play a strange delirious part.
141,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Of the things of nature the medieval mind had a deep sense; but its
142,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"sense of them was not objective, no real escape [219] to the world"
143,WALTER HORATIO PATER,without us.  The aspects and motions of nature only reinforced its
144,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"prevailing mood, and were in conspiracy with one's own brain against"
145,WALTER HORATIO PATER,one.  A single sentiment invaded the world: everything was infused
146,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"with a motive drawn from the soul.  The amorous poetry of Provence,"
147,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"making the starling and the swallow its messengers, illustrates the"
148,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"whole attitude of nature in this electric atmosphere, bent as by"
149,WALTER HORATIO PATER,miracle or magic to the service of human passion.
150,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
151,WALTER HORATIO PATER,The most popular and gracious form of Provencal poetry was the
152,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"nocturn, sung by the lover at night at the door or under the window"
153,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"of his mistress.  These songs were of different kinds, according to"
154,WALTER HORATIO PATER,the hour at which they were intended to be sung.  Some were to be
155,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"sung at midnight--songs inviting to sleep, the serena, or serenade;"
156,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"others at break of day--waking songs, the aube or aubade.*  This"
157,WALTER HORATIO PATER,waking-song is put sometimes into the mouth of a comrade of the
158,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"lover, who plays sentinel during the night, to watch for and announce"
159,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"the dawn: sometimes into the mouth of one of the lovers, who are"
160,WALTER HORATIO PATER,about to separate.  A modification of it is familiar to us all in
161,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Romeo and Juliet, where the lovers debate whether the song they hear"
162,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"is of the nightingale or the lark; the aubade, with the two other"
163,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"great forms of love-poetry then floating in the world, the sonnet and"
164,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"the [220] epithalamium, being here refined, heightened, and inwoven"
165,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"into the structure of the play.  Those, in whom what Rousseau calls"
166,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"les frayeurs nocturnes are constitutional, know what splendour they"
167,WALTER HORATIO PATER,give to the things of the morning; and how there comes something of
168,WALTER HORATIO PATER,relief from physical pain with the first white film in the sky.  The
169,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Middle Age knew those terrors in all their forms; and these songs of
170,WALTER HORATIO PATER,the morning win hence a strange tenderness and effect.  The crown of
171,WALTER HORATIO PATER,the English poet's book is one of these appreciations of the dawn:--
172,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
173,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"""Pray but one prayer for me 'twixt thy closed lips,"
174,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Think but one thought of me up in the stars,"
175,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"The summer-night waneth, the morning light slips,"
176,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Faint and gray 'twixt the leaves of the aspen,"
177,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"betwixt the cloud-bars,"
178,WALTER HORATIO PATER,That are patiently waiting there for the dawn:
179,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Patient and colourless, though Heaven's gold"
180,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Waits to float through them along with the sun.
181,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Far out in the meadows, above the young corn,"
182,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"The heavy elms wait, and restless and cold"
183,WALTER HORATIO PATER,The uneasy wind rises; the roses are dun;
184,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Through the long twilight they pray for the dawn,"
185,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Round the lone house in the midst of the corn.
186,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Speak but one word to me over the corn,"
187,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Over the tender, bow'd locks of the corn."""
188,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
189,WALTER HORATIO PATER,It is the very soul of the bridegroom which goes forth to the bride:
190,WALTER HORATIO PATER,inanimate things are longing with him: all the sweetness of the
191,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"imaginative loves [221] of the Middle Age, with a superadded"
192,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"spirituality of touch all its own, is in that!"
193,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
194,WALTER HORATIO PATER,The Defence of Guenevere was published in 1858; the Life and Death of
195,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Jason in 1867; to be followed by The Earthly Paradise; and the change
196,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"of manner wrought in the interval, entire, almost a revolt, is"
197,WALTER HORATIO PATER,characteristic of the aesthetic poetry.  Here there is no delirium or
198,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"illusion, no experiences of mere soul while the body and the bodily"
199,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"senses sleep, or wake with convulsed intensity at the prompting of"
200,WALTER HORATIO PATER,imaginative love; but rather the great primary passions under broad
201,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"daylight as of the pagan Veronese.  This simplification interests us,"
202,WALTER HORATIO PATER,not merely for the sake of an individual poet--full of charm as he
203,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"is--but chiefly because it explains through him a transition which,"
204,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"under many forms, is one law of the life of the human spirit, and of"
205,WALTER HORATIO PATER,which what we call the Renaissance is only a supreme instance.  Just
206,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"so the monk in his cloister, through the ""open vision,"" open only to"
207,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"the spirit, divined, aspired to, and at last apprehended, a better"
208,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"daylight, but earthly, open only to the senses.  Complex and subtle"
209,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"interests, which the mind spins for itself may occupy art and poetry"
210,WALTER HORATIO PATER,or our own spirits for a time; but sooner or later they come back
211,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"with a sharp rebound to the simple elementary passions--anger,"
212,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"desire, regret, [222] pity, and fear: and what corresponds to them in"
213,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"the sensuous world--bare, abstract fire, water, air, tears, sleep,"
214,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"silence, and what De Quincey has called the ""glory of motion."""
215,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
216,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"This reaction from dreamlight to daylight gives, as always happens, a"
217,WALTER HORATIO PATER,strange power in dealing with morning and the things of the morning.
218,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Not less is this Hellenist of the Middle Age master of dreams, of"
219,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"sleep and the desire of sleep--sleep in which no one walks, restorer"
220,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"of childhood to men--dreams, not like Galahad's or Guenevere's, but"
221,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"full of happy, childish wonder as in the earlier world.  It is a"
222,WALTER HORATIO PATER,world in which the centaur and the ram with the fleece of gold are
223,WALTER HORATIO PATER,conceivable.  The song sung always claims to be sung for the first
224,WALTER HORATIO PATER,time.  There are hints at a language common to birds and beasts and
225,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"men.  Everywhere there is an impression of surprise, as of people"
226,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"first waking from the golden age, at fire, snow, wine, the touch of"
227,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"water as one swims, the salt taste of the sea.  And this simplicity"
228,WALTER HORATIO PATER,at first hand is a strange contrast to the sought-out simplicity of
229,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Wordsworth.  Desire here is towards the body of nature for its own
230,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"sake, not because a soul is divined through it."
231,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
232,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"And yet it is one of the charming anachronisms of a poet, who, while"
233,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"he handles an ancient subject, never becomes an antiquarian, but"
234,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"animates his [223] subject by keeping it always close to himself,"
235,WALTER HORATIO PATER,that betweenwhiles we have a sense of English scenery as from an eye
236,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"well practised under Wordsworth's influence, as from ""the casement"
237,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"half opened on summer-nights,"" with the song of the brown bird among"
238,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"the willows, the"
239,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
240,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"""Noise of bells, such as in moonlit lanes"
241,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Rings from the grey team on the market night."""
242,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
243,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Nowhere but in England is there such a ""paradise of birds,"" the"
244,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"fern-owl, the water-hen, the thrush in a hundred sweet variations, the"
245,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"ger-falcon, the kestrel, the starling, the pea-fowl; birds heard from"
246,WALTER HORATIO PATER,the field by the townsman down in the streets at dawn; doves
247,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"everywhere, pink-footed, grey-winged, flitting about the temple,"
248,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"troubled by the temple incense, trapped in the snow.  The sea-touches"
249,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"are not less sharp and firm, surest of effect in places where river"
250,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"and sea, salt and fresh waves, conflict."
251,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
252,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"In handling a subject of Greek legend, anything in the way of an"
253,WALTER HORATIO PATER,actual revival must always be impossible.  Such vain antiquarianism
254,WALTER HORATIO PATER,in a waste of the poet's power.  The composite experience of all the
255,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"ages is part of each one of us: to deduct from that experience, to"
256,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"obliterate any part of it, to come face to face with the people of a"
257,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"past age, as if the Middle Age, the Renaissance, the eighteenth"
258,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"century had not been, is as impossible as to become a little [224]"
259,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"child, or enter again into the womb and be born.  But though it is"
260,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"not possible to repress a single phase of that humanity, which,"
261,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"because we live and move and have our being in the life of humanity,"
262,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"makes us what we are, it is possible to isolate such a phase, to"
263,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"throw it into relief, to be divided against ourselves in zeal for it;"
264,WALTER HORATIO PATER,as we may hark back to some choice space of our own individual life.
265,WALTER HORATIO PATER,We cannot truly conceive the age: we can conceive the element it has
266,WALTER HORATIO PATER,contributed to our culture: we can treat the subjects of the age
267,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"bringing that into relief.  Such an attitude towards Greece, aspiring"
268,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"to but never actually reaching its way of conceiving life, is what is"
269,WALTER HORATIO PATER,possible for art.
270,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
271,WALTER HORATIO PATER,The modern poet or artist who treats in this way a classical story
272,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"comes very near, if not to the Hellenism of Homer, yet to the"
273,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Hellenism of Chaucer, the Hellenism of the Middle Age, or rather of"
274,WALTER HORATIO PATER,that exquisite first period of the Renaissance within it.  Afterwards
275,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"the Renaissance takes its side, becomes, perhaps, exaggerated or"
276,WALTER HORATIO PATER,facile.  But the choice life of the human spirit is always under
277,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"mixed lights, and in mixed situations, when it is not too sure of"
278,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"itself, is still expectant, girt up to leap forward to the promise."
279,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Such a situation there was in that earliest return from the
280,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"overwrought spiritualities of the Middle Age to the earlier, more"
281,WALTER HORATIO PATER,ancient life of the senses; and for us the most attractive form of
282,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"[225] classical story is the monk's conception of it, when he escapes"
283,WALTER HORATIO PATER,from the sombre atmosphere of his cloister to natural light.  The
284,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"fruits of this mood, which, divining more than it understands,"
285,WALTER HORATIO PATER,infuses into the scenery and figures of Christian history some subtle
286,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"reminiscence of older gods, or into the story of Cupid and Psyche"
287,WALTER HORATIO PATER,that passionate stress of spirit which the world owes to
288,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"Christianity, constitute a peculiar vein of interest in the art of"
289,WALTER HORATIO PATER,the fifteenth century.
290,WALTER HORATIO PATER,
291,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"And so, before we leave Jason and The Earthly Paradise, a word must"
292,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"be said about their medievalisms, delicate inconsistencies, which,"
293,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"coming in a poem of Greek subject, bring into this white dawn"
294,WALTER HORATIO PATER,thoughts of the delirious night just over and make one's sense of
295,WALTER HORATIO PATER,relief deeper.  The opening of the fourth book of Jason describes the
296,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"embarkation of the Argonauts: as in a dream, the scene shifts and we"
297,WALTER HORATIO PATER,go down from Iolchos to the sea through a pageant of the Middle Age
298,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"in some French or Italian town.  The gilded vanes on the spires, the"
299,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"bells ringing in the towers, the trellis of roses at the window, the"
300,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"close planted with apple-trees, the grotesque undercroft with its"
301,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"close-set pillars, change by a single touch the air of these Greek"
302,WALTER HORATIO PATER,cities and we are at Glastonbury by the tomb of Arthur.  The nymph in
303,WALTER HORATIO PATER,furred raiment who seduces Hylas is conceived frankly in the spirit
304,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"of Teutonic romance; her song is of a garden [226] enclosed, such as"
305,WALTER HORATIO PATER,that with which the old church glass-stainer surrounds the mystic
306,WALTER HORATIO PATER,bride of the song of songs.  Medea herself has a hundred touches of

308,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Blocksberg: her mystic changes are Christabel's.  It is precisely
309,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"this effect, this grace of Hellenism relieved against the sorrow of"
310,WALTER HORATIO PATER,"the Middle Age, which forms the chief motives of The Earthly"
311,WALTER HORATIO PATER,Paradise: with an exquisite dexterity the two threads of sentiment
312,WALTER HORATIO PATER,are here interwoven and contrasted.  A band of adventurers sets out
