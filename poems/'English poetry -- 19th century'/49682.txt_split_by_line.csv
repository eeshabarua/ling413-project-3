51,PREFACE.,
52,PREFACE.,The following trifles have already made their appearance in various
53,PREFACE.,periodicals. The limit of their pretension is obvious from their
54,PREFACE.,"individual brevity and collective title; with few exceptions, they"
55,PREFACE.,were intended simply as drawing-room songs. Without aspiring to the high
56,PREFACE.,"level of the days when Praed, Bayly, Hood, Fitzgerald, Theodore Hook,"
57,PREFACE.,"and the two Smiths wrote for music, may I flatter myself that these"
58,PREFACE.,Carols are at least equal in point of taste (if not in point of humour)
59,PREFACE.,to certain light and lively ballads that are at present popular through
60,PREFACE.,the medium of the music-halls?
61,PREFACE.,
62,PREFACE.,Some readers will probably think the name of this book suspiciously
63,PREFACE.,similar to that of Mr Frederick Locker's charming _London Lyrics_.
64,PREFACE.,Let me anticipate a charge of plagiarism by observing that Mr. Locker
65,PREFACE.,himself was kind enough to send me the suggestion for my present title.
66,PREFACE.,
67,PREFACE.,To those gentlemen who have given me permission to republish various
68,PREFACE.,"verses in this collection, I am sincerely obliged."

96,THE TWINS.,
97,THE TWINS.,"It puzzled all our kith and kin,"
98,THE TWINS.,
99,THE TWINS.,It reach'd an awful pitch;
100,THE TWINS.,
101,THE TWINS.,For one of us was born a twin
102,THE TWINS.,
103,THE TWINS.,And not a soul knew which.
104,THE TWINS.,
105,THE TWINS.,
106,THE TWINS.,

134,THE TWINS.,
135,THE TWINS.,I put this question hopelessly

147,THE TWINS.,For somehow my Intended bride
148,THE TWINS.,
149,THE TWINS.,Became my brother's wife.
150,THE TWINS.,
151,THE TWINS.,"In short, year after year the same"
152,THE TWINS.,
153,THE TWINS.,Absurd mistakes went on;
154,THE TWINS.,
155,THE TWINS.,And when I died--the neighbours came
156,THE TWINS.,
157,THE TWINS.,And buried brother John!

222,UN PAS QUI COÛTE.,"I was laudably ambitious to extend my reputation,"
223,UN PAS QUI COÛTE.,
224,UN PAS QUI COÛTE.,And I plann'd a pretty novel on a pretty novel plan;

226,UN PAS QUI COÛTE.,"I would make it independent both of sin and of ""sensation,"""
227,UN PAS QUI COÛTE.,
228,UN PAS QUI COÛTE.,And my villain should be pictured as a persecuted man.
