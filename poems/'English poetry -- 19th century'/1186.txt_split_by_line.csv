153,TO A POET,
154,TO A POET,Thou shalt intimately lie

239,TO THE BELOVED,
240,TO THE BELOVED,Thou art like silence all unvexed
241,TO THE BELOVED,Though wild words part my soul from thee.
242,TO THE BELOVED,"Thou art like silence unperplexed,"
243,TO THE BELOVED,A secret and a mystery
244,TO THE BELOVED,Between one footfall and the next.

438,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
439,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"O mother, for the weight of years that break thee!"
440,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"O daughter, for slow time must yet awake thee,"
441,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,And from the changes of my heart must make thee.
442,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
443,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"O fainting traveller, morn is grey in heaven."
444,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,Dost thou remember how the clouds were driven?
445,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,And are they calm about the fall of even?
446,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
447,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Pause near the ending of thy long migration,"
448,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,For this one sudden hour of desolation
449,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,Appeals to one hour of thy meditation.
450,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
451,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Suffer, O silent one, that I remind thee"
452,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Of the great hills that stormed the sky behind thee,"
453,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,Of the wild winds of power that have resigned thee.
454,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
455,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,Know that the mournful plain where thou must wander
456,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Is but a grey and silent world, but ponder"
457,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,The misty mountains of the morning yonder.
458,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
459,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Listen:- the mountain winds with rain were fretting,"
460,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,And sudden gleams the mountain-tops besetting.
461,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"I cannot let thee fade to death, forgetting."
462,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
463,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,What part of this wild heart of mine I know not
464,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Will follow with thee where the great winds blow not,"
465,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,And where the young flowers of the mountain grow not.
466,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
467,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,Yet let my letter with thy lost thoughts in it
468,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Tell what the way was when thou didst begin it,"
469,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,And win with thee the goal when thou shalt win it.
470,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
471,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Oh, in some hour of thine my thoughts shall guide thee."
472,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Suddenly, though time, darkness, silence hide thee,"

474,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
475,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Telling thee: all thy memories moved the maiden,"
476,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"With thy regrets was morning over-shaden,"
477,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"With sorrow thou hast left, her life was laden."
478,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
479,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,But whither shall my thoughts turn to pursue thee
480,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Life changes, and the years and days renew thee."
481,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Oh, Nature brings my straying heart unto thee."
482,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
483,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Her winds will join us, with their constant kisses"
484,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Upon the evening as the morning tresses,"
485,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,Her summers breathe the same unchanging blisses.
486,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
487,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"And we, so altered in our shifting phases,"
488,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,Track one another 'mid the many mazes
489,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,By the eternal child-breath of the daisies.
490,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
491,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,I have not writ this letter of divining
492,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"To make a glory of thy silent pining,"
493,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,A triumph of thy mute and strange declining.
494,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
495,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Only one youth, and the bright life was shrouded."
496,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Only one morning, and the day was clouded."
497,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,And one old age with all regrets is crowded.
498,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
499,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Oh, hush; oh, hush!  Thy tears my words are steeping."
500,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Oh, hush, hush, hush!  So full, the fount of weeping?"
501,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Poor eyes, so quickly moved, so near to sleeping?"
502,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
503,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,Pardon the girl; such strange desires beset her.
504,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"Poor woman, lay aside the mournful letter"
505,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"That breaks thy heart; the one who wrote, forget her."
506,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,
507,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"The one who now thy faded features guesses,"
508,A LETTER FROM A GIRL TO HER OWN OLD AGE,"With filial fingers thy grey hair caresses,"

815,IN EARLY SPRING,"The notes that stir you so,"
816,IN EARLY SPRING,Your songs yet half devised in the dim dear
817,IN EARLY SPRING,Beginnings of the year.
818,IN EARLY SPRING,In these young days you meditate your part;
819,IN EARLY SPRING,I have it all by heart.
820,IN EARLY SPRING,
821,IN EARLY SPRING,I know the secrets of the seeds of flowers
822,IN EARLY SPRING,"Hidden and warm with showers,"
823,IN EARLY SPRING,"And how, in kindling Spring, the cuckoo shall"
824,IN EARLY SPRING,Alter his interval.
825,IN EARLY SPRING,But not a flower or song I ponder is
826,IN EARLY SPRING,"My own, but memory's."
827,IN EARLY SPRING,I shall be silent in those days desired
828,IN EARLY SPRING,Before a world inspired.
829,IN EARLY SPRING,"O dear brown birds, compose your old song-phrases"
830,IN EARLY SPRING,"Earth, thy familiar daisies."

832,IN EARLY SPRING,"The poet mused upon the dusky height,"
833,IN EARLY SPRING,"Between two stars towards night,"
834,IN EARLY SPRING,"His purpose in his heart.  I watched, a space,"
835,IN EARLY SPRING,The meaning of his face:
836,IN EARLY SPRING,"There was the secret, fled from earth and skies,"
837,IN EARLY SPRING,Hid in his grey young eyes.
838,IN EARLY SPRING,"My heart and all the Summer wait his choice,"
839,IN EARLY SPRING,And wonder for his voice.
840,IN EARLY SPRING,"Who shall foretell his songs, and who aspire"
841,IN EARLY SPRING,But to divine his lyre?
842,IN EARLY SPRING,"Sweet earth, we know thy dimmest mysteries,"
843,IN EARLY SPRING,But he is lord of his.
