46,I.,
47,I.,"Source of the Light that cheers this later day,"
48,I.,Science calm moves to spread her sovereign sway;
49,I.,"Research and Reason, ranged on either hand,"
50,I.,Proclaim her message to each waiting land;
51,I.,"In truths whose import stands but part revealed,"
52,I.,Till man befit himself those truths to wield;
53,I.,"Since to high Knowledge duties high belong,"
54,I.,As to the poet’s power the task of worthy song.
55,I.,
56,I.,
57,II.,II.
58,II.,
59,II.,"And man, from every stage of slow degree,"
60,II.,Amendment for his previous rule may see;
61,II.,His keener conscience in our fuller time
62,II.,"Perceives the whilom careless act a crime,"
63,II.,"Or finds some fancied fault to progress tend,—"
64,II.,By wiser vision traced to truer end;
65,II.,"Till, growing shrewder in the growing light,"
66,II.,We know no lack of good but our own lack of sight.
67,II.,
68,II.,
69,III.,III.
70,III.,
71,III.,"Thus, sad at first, we mark each evil deed,"
72,III.,"Of ignorance or will, bear fatal seed"
73,III.,"Of suffering to others in its train,—"
74,III.,"The guileless share its penalty of pain,—"
75,III.,And man’s worst misery ofttimes is brought
76,III.,By trespass he himself nor did nor thought;
77,III.,"Austere the fiat, yet therefrom we learn"
78,III.,"A purer life to frame, lest myriads mourn in turn."
79,III.,
80,III.,
81,IV.,IV.
82,IV.,
83,IV.,Deep though the teaching that this truth reveals
84,IV.,"Of fellowship of man with all that feels,"
85,IV.,"Remains the riddle that, though inmost ken"
86,IV.,Of humblest creatures and of rudest men
87,IV.,"Has sense of freedom as an instinct strong,—"
88,IV.,"Resenting injury as act of wrong,—"
89,IV.,"Man listed not this monitor’s still voice,"
90,IV.,But gave his wanton wish the guilty force of choice.
91,IV.,
92,IV.,
93,V.,V.
94,V.,
95,V.,"Dark looms the record of his earlier years,—"
96,V.,A troubled tale of infamy and tears;
97,V.,"For, of the ill by man primeval wrought,"
98,V.,"Shows forth predominant with anguish fraught,"
99,V.,"And long disaster to the ensuant race,"
100,V.,"The direful course of degradation base,"
101,V.,"Where freedom, justice, right,—at one fell blow,—"
102,V.,In woman’s life of slave were outraged and laid low.
103,V.,
104,V.,
105,VI.,VI.
106,VI.,
107,VI.,The inklings gleaned of prehistoric hour
108,VI.,Speak woman thrall to man’s unbridled power;
109,VI.,"Than brute more gifted, he, with heinous skill,"
110,VI.,Subdued her being to his sensual will;
111,VI.,"Binding her fast with ties of cunning weight,"
112,VI.,By mother’s burden forced to slavish fate;
113,VI.,"Thus woman was, and such her man-made doom,"
114,VI.,Ere yet the dawn of love illumed the soulless gloom.
115,VI.,
116,VI.,
117,VII.,VII.
118,VII.,
119,VII.,"Ere Evolution, in unhasting speed,"
120,VII.,Trained man’s regard to larger life and need;
121,VII.,"By Art his feelings waked to functions higher,"
122,VII.,"Disclosed within his clay the veins of fire,"
123,VII.,Taught him his pleasures of the flesh to find
124,VII.,But presage of the mightier joys of mind;
125,VII.,"Evoked the soul from fume of mortal dust,"
126,VII.,The vestal flame of love from lower flush of lust.
127,VII.,
128,VII.,
129,VIII.,VIII.
130,VIII.,
131,VIII.,The eye that once could note but food or foe
132,VIII.,Grew wise to watch the landscape’s varied glow;
133,VIII.,"To gaze beyond our earthly temporal bars,"
134,VIII.,And track the orbit of the wandering stars:
135,VIII.,The voice erst roused by hunger or by rage
136,VIII.,"Now tells the nobler passions of the age,"
137,VIII.,Till with love’s language is uplifted love
138,VIII.,To high and selfless thought all sensuous aim above.
139,VIII.,
140,VIII.,
141,IX.,IX.
142,IX.,
143,IX.,"But not at once such life and love to know,"
144,IX.,For progress strives through many an ebb and flow;
145,IX.,"Man’s kindling sense, though stirred by call of Art,"
146,IX.,Still missed the motive of her deepest heart;
147,IX.,’Twas in her gracious embassy to give
148,IX.,"A fairer faith and fate to all that live,"
149,IX.,"Neglecting none,—yet man, ’twixt lust and pride,"
150,IX.,Due portion in the boon to woman still denied.
151,IX.,
152,IX.,
153,X.,X.
154,X.,
155,X.,"Æons of wrong ere history was born,"
156,X.,"With added ages passed in slight and scorn,"
157,X.,"Maintained the chains of primal womanhood,"
158,X.,And clogged in turn man’s power of greater good;
159,X.,Egypt or Greece in vain sought heavenly light
160,X.,"While woman’s soul was held from equal flight,—"
161,X.,"Her path confined by man to sordid end,"
162,X.,"As subjugated wife, or hireling transient friend."
163,X.,
164,X.,
165,XI.,XI.
166,XI.,
167,XI.,"Marriage—which might have been a mateship sweet,"
168,XI.,"Where equal souls in hallowed converse meet,"
169,XI.,"Each aiding each the higher truths to find,"
170,XI.,"And raising body to the plane of mind,—"
171,XI.,"Man’s baser will restrained to lower grade,"
172,XI.,And woman’s share a brainless bondage made;
173,XI.,"Her only hope of thought or learning wide,"
174,XI.,Some freer lot to seek than yoke forlorn of bride.
175,XI.,
176,XI.,
177,XII.,XII.
178,XII.,
179,XII.,"Yet, as hetaira,—comrade, chambermate,—"
180,XII.,"(The ambiguous word bespoke her dubious state),"
181,XII.,"She, craving mental food, might but be guest"
182,XII.,By paying with her body for the quest;
183,XII.,"Conceding that, might lead a learned life,—"
184,XII.,"A licence vetoed to the legal wife,—"
185,XII.,"Might win great wealth, or build a lasting fame,"
186,XII.,Not due to her the guilt that left the tinge of shame.
187,XII.,
188,XII.,
189,XIII.,XIII.
190,XIII.,
191,XIII.,"What guilt was there, apportion it aright"
192,XIII.,To him who fixed the gages of the fight;
193,XIII.,"Blame man, who, reckless of the woman’s fate,"
194,XIII.,In greed for meaner pleasure lost the great;
195,XIII.,"Blame him, the vaunted sage, who knew her mind"
196,XIII.,"Peer to his own in skill and wit refined,"
197,XIII.,Yet left the after-ages to bemoan
198,XIII.,The waste of woman worth that dawned and die unknown.
199,XIII.,
200,XIII.,
201,XIV.,XIV.
202,XIV.,
203,XIV.,And deep the shame on man’s insensate heart
204,XIV.,For later woman doomed to hideous part;
205,XIV.,"Poor lostling, bowed with worse than brutal woes,—"
206,XIV.,To her not even dealt the brute’s repose;
207,XIV.,"Her sweetness sullied, and her frame disgraced,"
208,XIV.,"Soul scarce might light her temple fair defaced,—"
209,XIV.,Its chastest sanctities coerced to give
210,XIV.,"For painful bread to eat, for piteous chance to live."
211,XIV.,
212,XIV.,
213,XV.,XV.
214,XV.,
215,XV.,"While such her fate in lands of cultured creed,"
216,XV.,Judge woman’s griefs with man of barbarous breed;
217,XV.,"Slave to his lust, and tiller of his soil,"
218,XV.,Crippled and crushed by cruelty and toil;
219,XV.,"Yet still her heart a gentle mien essayed,"
220,XV.,"By deeper passion, holier impulse, swayed;"
221,XV.,"Care for her wretched offspring rarely swerved,"
222,XV.,And mother-love alone the infant oft preserved.
223,XV.,
224,XV.,
225,XVI.,XVI.
226,XVI.,
227,XVI.,"Thus woman’s life, in low or high estate,"
228,XVI.,Man fettered with a more than natural weight
229,XVI.,"Of sexual function,—disproportioned theme"
230,XVI.,And single basis in his female scheme;
231,XVI.,"He strove to quench her flash of quicker fire,"
232,XVI.,That crossed his lordship or his low desire;
233,XVI.,"Her one permitted end to serve his race,"
234,XVI.,Her individual soul forbidden breathing place.
235,XVI.,
236,XVI.,
237,XVII.,XVII.
238,XVII.,
239,XVII.,Scarce other seemed that soul than sentient tomb
240,XVII.,Of human energy debarred to bloom;
241,XVII.,"Her spirit, pining in its durance drear,"
242,XVII.,Leaves legacy of many a burning tear
243,XVII.,"For aspirations crushed, and aims denied,"
244,XVII.,And instincts thwarted by man’s purblind pride;
245,XVII.,Her every wish made subject to the nod
246,XVII.,Of him whose mad conceit proclaimed himself her God.
247,XVII.,
248,XVII.,
249,XVIII.,XVIII.
250,XVIII.,
251,XVIII.,"So stood at halt, through years of sterile change,"
252,XVIII.,His narrowed brain and her restricted range;
253,XVIII.,"And man intelligent and woman free,"
254,XVIII.,Was union which the world had yet to see;
255,XVIII.,For time to come reserved the golden sight
256,XVIII.,"Of glorious harvest from the natural right,"
257,XVIII.,To her as amply as to him assigned
258,XVIII.,To compass power unknown in body and in mind.
259,XVIII.,
260,XVIII.,
261,XIX.,XIX.
262,XIX.,
263,XIX.,Happy the epoch destined to show
264,XIX.,What force of good from that free fate shall flow;
265,XIX.,The artificial limits to efface
266,XIX.,Of laws and forms that womanhood debase;
267,XIX.,Even our own imperfect hour may prove
268,XIX.,The ecstasy of earnest souls that move
269,XIX.,In dual union of unselfish strife
270,XIX.,To reach by mutual love to true and equal life.
271,XIX.,
272,XIX.,
273,XX.,XX.
274,XX.,
275,XX.,"Yet slow, so slowly, gleams the gathering light,"
276,XX.,And lingers still the hovering shade of night;
277,XX.,"Though part undone the wrong that we confess,"
278,XX.,Repentance cannot instant bring redress;
279,XX.,"Nor woman, tortured by her thraldom long,"
280,XX.,At once stand forth emancipate and strong;
281,XX.,"Her pain persistent, though she calm suppress"
282,XX.,"Her rancour for the past, with sweet forgivingness."
283,XX.,
284,XX.,
285,XXI.,XXI.
286,XXI.,
287,XXI.,"For carnal servitude left cruel stain,"
288,XXI.,And galls that fester from the fleshly chain;
289,XXI.,"Unhealed the scars of man’s distempered greed,"
290,XXI.,The wounds of blind injustice still they bleed;
291,XXI.,Recurrent suffering lets her not forget
292,XXI.,"The aimless payments of a dismal debt,—"
293,XXI.,Survival from dim age of man’s abuse
294,XXI.,"Of functions immature, profaned by savage use."
295,XXI.,
296,XXI.,
297,XXII.,XXII.
298,XXII.,
299,XXII.,Her girlhood’s helpless years through cycles long
300,XXII.,"Had been a martyrdom of sexual wrong,"
301,XXII.,For little strength or choice might child oppose
302,XXII.,To shield herself from force of sensual foes;
303,XXII.,Impending motherhood might win no rest
304,XXII.,Or refuge sacred from the satyr quest;
305,XXII.,"Unripe maternity, untimely birth,"
306,XXII.,The woman’s constant dole in those dark days of earth.
307,XXII.,
308,XXII.,
309,XXIII.,XXIII.
310,XXIII.,
311,XXIII.,"Action repeated tends to rhythmic course,"
312,XXIII.,"And thus the mischief, due at first to force,"
313,XXIII.,"Brought cumulative sequence to the race,"
314,XXIII.,Till habit bred hereditary trace;
315,XXIII.,"On woman falls that heritage of woe,"
316,XXIII.,"And e’en the virgin feels its dastard blow,—"
317,XXIII.,"For, long ere fit to wield maternal cares,"
318,XXIII.,Abnormal fruits of birth her guiltless body bears.
319,XXIII.,
320,XXIII.,
321,XXIV.,XXIV.
322,XXIV.,
323,XXIV.,"Misread by man, this sign of his misdeed"
324,XXIV.,"Was held as symptom of her nubile need,"
325,XXIV.,And on through history’s length her tender age
326,XXIV.,Has still been victim to his adult rage;
327,XXIV.,"He, by his text, with irony serene,"
328,XXIV.,Banned her resultant “manner” as “unclean”;
329,XXIV.,"The censure base upon himself recoils,"
330,XXIV.,Yet leaves the woman wan and cumbered in his toils.
331,XXIV.,
332,XXIV.,
333,XXV.,XXV.
334,XXV.,
335,XXV.,Vicarious punishment for manhood’s crime
336,XXV.,Takes grievous toll of all her active prime;
337,XXV.,"The hap, in educated woman’s fate,"
338,XXV.,Is instinct with antipathy and hate;
339,XXV.,"Reason confirming tells, no honest claim"
340,XXV.,"Could ever cause such gust of inward shame,"
341,XXV.,Nor act of normal wont might man blaspheme
342,XXV.,To make of Nature’s need a vile opprobrious theme.
343,XXV.,
344,XXV.,
345,XXVI.,XXVI.
346,XXVI.,
347,XXVI.,Thoughts like to these are breathings of the truth
348,XXVI.,To whoso ponders deep the tale of ruth;
349,XXVI.,The futile mannish pleas that would explain
350,XXVI.,"The purport of her periodic pain,"
351,XXVI.,All bear unconscious witness to the wrong
352,XXVI.,"In blindness born, in error fostered long,—"
353,XXVI.,"The spurious function growing with the years,"
354,XXVI.,Till almost natural use the morbid mode appears.
355,XXVI.,
356,XXVI.,
357,XXVII.,XXVII.
358,XXVII.,
359,XXVII.,"Grievous the hurt to woman, which to right"
360,XXVII.,Is instant duty of our stronger sight;
361,XXVII.,"From off her weary shoulders, bruised and worn,"
362,XXVII.,To lift the cross in longtime misery borne;
363,XXVII.,"Until, reintegrate in frame and mind,"
364,XXVII.,"A speedy restitution she shall find,"
365,XXVII.,"From every trammel of man’s mastery freed,"
366,XXVII.,Nor held by his behest from fullest life and deed.
367,XXVII.,
368,XXVII.,
369,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
370,XXVIII.,
371,XXVIII.,"And soon may pass her suffering, for the ill"
372,XXVIII.,By man begot lies subject to our skill;
373,XXVIII.,All human malady may be allayed
374,XXVIII.,"With human forethought, human action’s aid;"
375,XXVIII.,"Ours then the fault, since, given in our hand"
376,XXVIII.,Is power the evil hazard to command;
377,XXVIII.,"For Nature, kindly wise our woes to shape,"
378,XXVIII.,In very pang of pain both prompts and points escape.
379,XXVIII.,
380,XXVIII.,
381,XXIX.,XXIX.
382,XXIX.,
383,XXIX.,"So woman shall her own redemption gain,"
384,XXIX.,Instructed by the sting of bootless pain;
385,XXIX.,With Nature ever helpful to retrieve
386,XXIX.,"The injury we heedlessly achieve,"
387,XXIX.,"From seed of act, by recent woman sown,"
388,XXIX.,Already guerdon rich in hope is shown;—
389,XXIX.,"Such faculty her new-found presence decks,"
390,XXIX.,"The sage physician, she, and saviour of her sex."
391,XXIX.,
392,XXIX.,
393,XXX.,XXX.
394,XXX.,
395,XXX.,With purer phase of life proves woman less
396,XXX.,The burden of the wasting weariness;
397,XXX.,"And thus, in rank refined or rude have grown"
398,XXX.,Maidens in whom the weakness was not known;
399,XXX.,"Hale woman and true mother have they been,"
400,XXX.,Yet never have the noisome habit seen:
401,XXX.,Not to neglectful man to greatly care
402,XXX.,How such immunity all womanhood might share.
403,XXX.,
404,XXX.,
405,XXXI.,XXXI.
406,XXXI.,
407,XXXI.,"Her intellect alert the harm shall heal,"
408,XXXI.,And ways of wholesomeness and strength reveal;
409,XXXI.,The saving truth she wins with studious thought
410,XXXI.,"More swiftly to her daughter shall be taught,—"
411,XXXI.,"How body still is supple unto mind,"
412,XXXI.,"By dint of soul is fleshly form inclined,"
413,XXXI.,"And woman’s will shall work of man atone,"
414,XXXI.,The deed his darkness wrought be by her light undone.
415,XXXI.,
416,XXXI.,
417,XXXII.,XXXII.
418,XXXII.,
419,XXXII.,"No longer drilled deformity to nurse,"
420,XXXII.,"And woo, when slow to appear, the absent curse,"
421,XXXII.,"Her counter-effort, helped by Nature’s grace,"
422,XXXII.,Shall quell the “custom’s” last abhorrent trace;
423,XXXII.,"Its morbid usurpation shall refute,—"
424,XXXII.,Not more to woman natural than to brute;—
425,XXXII.,"A needless noyance with a baseless claim,"
426,XXXII.,The lingering mark of man’s unthinking guilt and shame.
427,XXXII.,
428,XXXII.,
429,XXXIII.,XXXIII.
430,XXXIII.,
431,XXXIII.,"Her body, saved from enervating drain,"
432,XXXIII.,Shall lend a newer vigour to the brain;
433,XXXIII.,"Wide shall she roam in realms of untold thought,"
434,XXXIII.,Which ages since her shackled instinct sought;
435,XXXIII.,"For oft her prison had the yearnings heard,"
436,XXXIII.,In murmurings scarce rendered into word;—
437,XXXIII.,"Promptings which man suspicious strove to choke,"
438,XXXIII.,Lest that her soul should rise and break his timeworn yoke.
439,XXXIII.,
440,XXXIII.,
441,XXXIV.,XXXIV.
442,XXXIV.,
443,XXXIV.,"For autocrats of old, with treacherous guile,"
444,XXXIV.,Had bribed the villain’s soul by sensual wile;
445,XXXIV.,"To meanest man a lower drudge assigned,—"
446,XXXIV.,With gift of female thrall cajoled the hind;
447,XXXIV.,The stolid churl his servitude forgave
448,XXXIV.,Whilst he in turn was master to a slave;
449,XXXIV.,"Through every rank the sexual serfdom ran,"
450,XXXIV.,And woman’s life was bound in vassalage to man.
451,XXXIV.,
452,XXXIV.,
453,XXXV.,XXXV.
454,XXXV.,
455,XXXV.,"Then, fearing that the slave herself might guess"
456,XXXV.,"The knavery of her forced enchainedness,"
457,XXXV.,A subtle fiction mannish brain designed
458,XXXV.,"To dominate her conscience and her mind,—"
459,XXXV.,"Inhuman dogmas did his genius frame,"
460,XXXV.,Investing them with sanctimonious name
461,XXXV.,Of “woman’s duty”; and the fetish base
462,XXXV.,E’en to this reasoned day uplifts its impious face.
463,XXXV.,
464,XXXV.,
465,XXXVI.,XXXVI.
466,XXXVI.,
467,XXXVI.,"By cant condoned, man fashioned woman’s “sphere,”"
468,XXXVI.,And mapped out “natural” bounds to her career;
469,XXXVI.,His sapience—should she dare any deed
470,XXXVI.,In contravention of his code—decreed
471,XXXVI.,"On soul or body penalties condign,"
472,XXXVI.,"In part dubbed civil law, and part divine:"
473,XXXVI.,"Misguided man,—confused in self-deceit"
474,XXXVI.,His unisexual wit and pious pretext meet.
475,XXXVI.,
476,XXXVI.,
477,XXXVII.,XXXVII.
478,XXXVII.,
479,XXXVII.,Obeisance yet his caste of sex demands;—
480,XXXVII.,In legislative script the verbiage stands
481,XXXVII.,"How lowest boor is lordly “baron” styled,"
482,XXXVII.,And highest bride as common “feme” reviled;
483,XXXVII.,The tardier fear that grants the clown a share
484,XXXVII.,"In his own governance, denies it her;"
485,XXXVII.,"And British matrons are, by man-made rules,"
486,XXXVII.,"In solemn statute ranked with infants, felons, fools."
487,XXXVII.,
488,XXXVII.,
489,XXXVIII.,XXXVIII.
490,XXXVIII.,
491,XXXVIII.,"The crass injustice early man displayed,"
492,XXXVIII.,His own crude infancy of brain betrayed;
493,XXXVIII.,"His riper judgment scorns the childish use,"
494,XXXVIII.,And cries to all his bygone freaks a truce;
495,XXXVIII.,Enactments that long blemished legal page
496,XXXVIII.,"Shall fade as figments of a foolish age,"
497,XXXVIII.,Till saner years have every bond erased
498,XXXVIII.,Which selfish law of man on life of woman placed.
499,XXXVIII.,
500,XXXVIII.,
501,XXXIX.,XXXIX.
502,XXXIX.,
503,XXXIX.,"Till like with him in human right she stands,"
504,XXXIX.,Her will an equal power of rule commands;
505,XXXIX.,"Her voice, in council and in senate heard,"
506,XXXIX.,To stern debate brings harmonising word;

1258,XIII.,"time-honoured restrictions, springing from a narrow theory which took"
1259,XIII.,"its rise in a pre-scientific age, are fraught with the gravest dangers,"

1262,XIII.,spending themselves freely and healthfully on their natural objects.
1263,XIII.,Anyone who has looked a little below the surface of women’s lives can
1264,XIII.,testify to the general unrest and nervous exhaustion or _malaise_ among
1265,XIII.,"them, although each would probably refer her suffering to some cause"
1266,XIII.,"peculiar to herself and her circumstances, never dreaming that she was"
1267,XIII.,"the victim of an evil that gnaws at the very heart of society, making of"
1268,XIII.,almost every woman the heroine of a silent tragedy. I think few keen
1269,XIII.,observers will deny that it is almost always the women of placid
1270,XIII.,"temperament, with very little sensibility, who are happy and contented;"
1271,XIII.,"those of more highly wrought nervous systems and imaginative faculty,"
1272,XIII.,who are nevertheless capable of far greater joy than their calmer
1273,XIII.,"sisters, in nine cases out of ten are secretly intensely miserable. And"
1274,XIII.,the cause of this is not eternal and unalterable. The nervously
1275,XIII.,organised being is _not_ created to be miserable; but when intense vital
1276,XIII.,energy is thwarted and misdirected—so long as the energy lasts—there
1277,XIII.,"must be intense suffering.... It is only when resignation sets in, when"
1278,XIII.,the ruling order convinces at last and tires out the rebel nerves and
1279,XIII.,"the keen intelligence, that we know that the living forces are defeated,"
1280,XIII.,and that death has come to quiet the suffering. All this is waste of

1292,XIII.,"beauty to man, and Nature gives strength and beauty to woman. In this"
1293,XIII.,"latter instance man flies in the face of Nature, and declares that she"
1294,XIII.,must be artificially restrained. Woman must not be allowed to grow up
1295,XIII.,"strong like man, because if she did the fact would establish her"
1296,XIII.,"equality with him, and this cannot be tolerated. So the boy and man are"
1297,XIII.,"allowed freedom of body, and are trained up to become muscular and"
1298,XIII.,"strong, while the woman, by artificial, not natural, laws, is bidden to"
1299,XIII.,"remain inactive and passive, and, in consequence, weak and undeveloped."
1300,XIII.,Mentally it is the same. Nature has unmistakably given to woman a
1301,XIII.,greater amount of brain power. This is at once perceivable in childhood.
1302,XIII.,"For instance, on the stage, girls are always employed in preference to"
1303,XIII.,"boys, for they are considered brighter and sharper in intellect and"
1304,XIII.,brain power. Yet man deliberately sets himself to stunt that early
1305,XIII.,evidence of mental capacity by laying down the law that woman’s
1306,XIII.,education shall be on a lower level than that of man’s; that natural
1307,XIII.,"truths, which all women should early learn, should be hidden from her;"
1308,XIII.,"and that while men may be taught everything, women must only acquire a"
1309,XIII.,narrow and imperfect knowledge both of life and of Nature’s laws. I
1310,XIII.,"maintain that this procedure is arbitrary and cruel, and false to"
1311,XIII.,Nature. I characterise it by the strong word of infamous. It has been
1312,XIII.,"the means of sending to their graves, unknown, unknelled, and unnamed,"

1321,XIII.,"ways. Indeed, nothing could prevent its being universally admitted"
1322,XIII.,except the fact that the remarkable rapidity with which women think is
1323,XIII.,"obscured by that miserable, that contemptible, that preposterous system"
1324,XIII.,"called their education, in which valuable things are carefully kept from"

1336,XIII.,every other attribute of mind of which men make so eminent a use; and
1337,XIII.,"the ideas of use and possession are so united together that, because it"
1338,XIII.,has been the custom in almost all countries to give to women a different

1346,XIII.,"womanly mind and virtue are in power and office, with respect to man’s;"
1347,XIII.,"and how their relations, rightly accepted, aid and increase the vigour,"
1348,XIII.,"and honour, and authority of both.... Let us see whether the greatest,"
1349,XIII.,"the wisest, the purest-hearted of all ages are agreed in anywise on this"
1350,XIII.,point.... And first let us take Shakespeare; ... there is hardly a play
1351,XIII.,"that has not a perfect woman in it, steadfast in grave hope and"
1352,XIII.,"errorless purpose.... Such, in broad light, is Shakespeare’s testimony"
1353,XIII.,to the position and character of women in human life. He represents them
1354,XIII.,"as infallibly faithful and wise counsellors, incorruptibly just and pure"
1355,XIII.,"examples, strong always to sanctify, even when they cannot save.... I"

1359,XIII.,watches over or educates his mistress.

1361,XIII.,"“Now I could multiply witness upon witness of this kind upon you, if I"
1362,XIII.,"had time. Nay, I could go back into the mythical teaching of the most"
1363,XIII.,"ancient times, and show you how the great people, how that great"
1364,XIII.,"Egyptian people, wisest then of nations, gave to their Spirit of Wisdom"
1365,XIII.,"the form of a woman; and into her hand, for a symbol, the weaver’s"
1366,XIII.,"shuttle; and how the name and form of that spirit adopted, believed, and"
1367,XIII.,"obeyed by the Greeks, became that Athena of the olive-helm and cloudy"
1368,XIII.,"shield, to whose faith you owe, down to this date, whatever you hold"
1369,XIII.,"most precious in art, in literature, or in types of national virtue."
1370,XIII.,
1371,XIII.,“But I will not wander into this distant and mythical element; I will
1372,XIII.,only ask you to give the legitimate value to the testimony of these
1373,XIII.,"great poets and men of the world, consistent as you see it is on this"
1374,XIII.,"head. I will ask you whether it can be supposed that these men, in the"
1375,XIII.,"main work of their lives, are amusing themselves with a fictitious and"
1376,XIII.,"idle view of the relations between man and woman; nay, worse than"
1377,XIII.,"fictitious or idle, for a thing may be imaginary yet desirable, if it"
1378,XIII.,"were possible; but this, their ideal of women, is, according to our"
1379,XIII.,"common idea of the marriage relation, wholly undesirable. The woman, we"
1380,XIII.,"say, is not to guide nor even to think for herself. The man is always to"
1381,XIII.,"be the wiser; he is to be the thinker, the ruler, the superior in"
1382,XIII.,"knowledge and discretion, as in power. Is it not somewhat important to"
1383,XIII.,"make up our minds on this matter? Are Shakespeare and Æschylus, Dante"
1384,XIII.,"and Homer merely dressing dolls for us; or, worse than dolls, unnatural"
1385,XIII.,"visions, the realisation of which, were it possible, would bring anarchy"
1386,XIII.,"into all households, and ruin into all affections? Are all these great"
1387,XIII.,"men mistaken, or, are we?”—(“Sesame and Lilies,” p. 125, _et seq._)"

1389,XIII.,"Truly, in the face of these things, Tennyson had reason concerning his"

1402,XIV.,"were many intervening or coalescing grades. Instance, as one of the"
1403,XIV.,"phases, the following sketch of an Indian courtesan:—“Lalun is a member"
1404,XIV.,of the most ancient profession in the world. Lilith was her
1405,XIV.,"very-great-grandmama, and that was before the days of Eve, as everyone"
1406,XIV.,"knows. In the West, people say rude things about Lalun’s profession, and"
1407,XIV.,"write lectures about it, and distribute the lectures to young people, in"
1408,XIV.,"order that morality may be preserved. In the East, where the profession"
1409,XIV.,"is hereditary, descending from mother to daughter, nobody writes"
1410,XIV.,lectures or takes any notice.”—Rudyard Kipling (“On the City Wall”).

1421,XIV.,"ante mortem_,” conceded to some of even the vilest and lowest of"
1422,XIV.,criminals condemned to capital punishment. Though such a condition is
1423,XIV.,"barely more than parallel to the pitch of infamy of modern times, as"

1429,XIV.,"counts, in fact, with the same _male_ company as one meets at the"
1430,XIV.,parties of the Princess Metternich and Madame Drouyn de Lhuys. Some
1431,XIV.,"English peers and members of Parliament were present, and appeared to"
1432,XIV.,enjoy the animated and dazzlingly improper scene. On the second floor
1433,XIV.,the supper-tables were loaded with every delicacy of the season. That
1434,XIV.,your readers may form some idea of the dainty fare of the Parisian
1435,XIV.,"_demi-monde_, I copy the _menu_ of the supper which was served to all"
1436,XIV.,"the guests (about 200) seated, at four o’clock. Choice Yquem,"
1437,XIV.,"Johannisberg, Lafitte, Tokay, and Champagne of the finest vintages"
1438,XIV.,were served most lavishly throughout the morning. After supper dancing
1439,XIV.,"was resumed with increased animation, and the ball terminated with a"
1440,XIV.,_chaine diabolique_ and a _cancan d’enfer_ at seven in the
1441,XIV.,"morning.”—(_Morning Post_, March 10th, 1865.)"
1442,XIV.,
1443,XIV.,To which perhaps the most fitting comment is certain words of
1444,XIV.,Letourneau’s:—“It is important to make a distinction. The resemblance
1445,XIV.,between the moral coarseness of the savage and the depravation of the
1446,XIV.,civilised man is quite superficial.... The brutality of the savage has
1447,XIV.,"nothing in common with the moral retrogression of the civilised man,"
1448,XIV.,"struck with decay.... The posterity of the savage may, with the aid of"
1449,XIV.,"time and culture, attain to great moral elevation, for there are vital"
1450,XIV.,forces within him which are fresh and intact. The primitive man is still
1451,XIV.,"young, and he possesses many latent energies susceptible of development."
1452,XIV.,"In short, the savage is a child, while the civilised man, whose moral"
1453,XIV.,"nature is corrupt, presents to us rather the picture of decrepit old"
1454,XIV.,"age.”—(“Evolution of Marriage,” Chap. V.)"
1455,XIV.,
1456,XIV.,If M. Letourneau will apply his strictures as to senility and decay to
1457,XIV.,"so-called “Society” and its system, rather than to the individual, he"
1458,XIV.,"will find many thinkers, both of his own and other nationalities, agree"
1459,XIV.,"with his conclusion. Yet not death, but reform, is the righter event to"
1460,XIV.,"indicate. And by what means that reform may be ensured is, at least in"
1461,XIV.,"part, clearly set forth in the following passage from a paper recently"
1462,XIV.,published by the Women’s Printing Society:—
1463,XIV.,
1464,XIV.,"“My positive belief is that women, and women alone, will be able to"
1465,XIV.,"reverse the world’s verdict, but they must change their method of"
1466,XIV.,reform in two important matters.
1467,XIV.,
1468,XIV.,"“First and foremost, every mother must teach her daughters the truth,"
1469,XIV.,"the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about the relations of the"
1470,XIV.,"sexes, the condition of social opinion, the historical, physiological,"
1471,XIV.,ethical aspects of the question. She must train herself so as to be
1472,XIV.,"able to teach the young minds these solemn, serious aspects of life,"
1473,XIV.,in such a way that the world may learn that the innocence of ignorance
1474,XIV.,"is inferior to the purity of right-minded, fearless knowledge. She"
1475,XIV.,"must strengthen the minds and form the judgment of her daughters, so"
1476,XIV.,that they may demand reciprocal purity in those whom they would
1477,XIV.,espouse.
1478,XIV.,
1479,XIV.,"“I fully understand the difficulty of teaching our pure-minded,"
1480,XIV.,delicately-nurtured daughters the terrible lessons of this seamy side
1481,XIV.,"of life. I am a mother of daughters myself, and I know the cost at"
1482,XIV.,"which the courage has to be obtained, but in this matter each mother"
1483,XIV.,must help another. What a mighty force is influence! What help is
1484,XIV.,conveyed by pressure of opinion! How often do I remember with
1485,XIV.,gratitude the words which I once read as quoted of Mrs. John Stuart
1486,XIV.,"Mill, who taught her little daughter to have the courage to hear what"
1487,XIV.,other little girls had to bear. How gladly I acknowledge the stimulus
1488,XIV.,"of that example to myself, and therefore I would urge all women to"
1489,XIV.,SPEAK OUT. Do not be afraid. You will not lose your womanliness. You
1490,XIV.,will not lose your purity. You will not have your sensibilities
1491,XIV.,"blunted by such rough use. No, “To the pure all things are pure.” We"
1492,XIV.,"must reach the mass through the unit, it is the individual who helps"
1493,XIV.,to move the world.
1494,XIV.,
1495,XIV.,“We must teach and train the mind of every woman with whom we come in
1496,XIV.,"contact, for we have mighty work to do. A no less deed than to reverse"
1497,XIV.,the judgment of the whole world on the subject of purity. I do not
1498,XIV.,believe it is possible for men to accomplish any radical reform in
1499,XIV.,this matter. It belongs to women—I was going to say exclusively—but I
1500,XIV.,will modify my assertion; and if women do not speak out more
1501,XIV.,"courageously in the future than they have done in the past, I believe"
1502,XIV.,there is but slight chance of any further amelioration in the
1503,XIV.,condition of society than those which are such an inadequate return at
1504,XIV.,"the present time, for all the love and money expended on them.”"
1505,XIV.,
1506,XIV.,"And the same writer says, on a still more recent occasion: “I find no"
1507,XIV.,words strong enough to denounce the sin of silence amongst women on
1508,XIV.,these social evils; and I have come to feel that the best proof of the
1509,XIV.,subjection and degradation of my sex lies in the opinions often
1510,XIV.,expressed by so-called Christian and pure women _about other women_. If
1511,XIV.,"their judgments were not perverted, if their wills were not broken, if"
1512,XIV.,"their consciences were not asleep, and if their souls were not enslaved,"
1513,XIV.,"they would not, they could not, hold their peace and let the havoc go on"
1514,XIV.,with women and children as it does.”—Mrs. Laura E. Morgan-Browne
1515,XIV.,"(“_Woman’s Herald_”, 27th Feb., 1892)."
1516,XIV.,
1517,XIV.,"Mrs. Morgan-Browne is, perhaps, not more than needfully severe on the"
1518,XIV.,almost criminal reticence of women; yet man must certainly take the
1519,XIV.,greater share of blame for the social “double morality” which condemns
1520,XIV.,"irrevocably a woman, and leaves practically unscathed a man, for the"
1521,XIV.,same act. It is male-made laws and rules that have resulted in the
1522,XIV.,"perverted judgments, broken wills, sleeping consciences, and enslaved"
1523,XIV.,"souls, which both sexes may deplore. Charles Kingsley pointed a cogent"
1524,XIV.,truth when he said that “Women will never obtain moral equity until they
1525,XIV.,"have civil equality.” (See also Note XXXV., 6.)"

1535,XV.,anarchic ages; they have doubtless set up a barrier against primitive
1536,XV.,"ferocity, they have interdicted certain absolutely terrible abuses of"
1537,XV.,"force, but they have only replaced these by a servitude which is still"
1538,XV.,"very heavy, is often iniquitous, and no longer permits to"
1539,XV.,"legally-possessed women those escapes, or capriciously accorded"

1545,XV.,

1547,XV.,result of brutal male recklessness. Instance the distortion of the feet
1548,XV.,"of high-born female children in China, the tradition concerning which is"
1549,XV.,"that the practice was initiated and enjoined by an emperor of old, one"
1550,XV.,of whose wives had (literally) “run away” from him. A somewhat similar
1551,XV.,precaution would seem to be indicated as a very probable source of the
1552,XV.,persistent and almost universal incommodity and incumbrance of the dress
1553,XV.,of woman as compared with that of man.
1554,XV.,
1555,XV.,"Dr. Thomas Inman, in his “Ancient Faiths Embodied in Ancient Names,”"
1556,XV.,"Vol. I., p. 53, seems to indicate a different, yet closely allied,"
1557,XV.,"origin and motive for the impeding form of woman’s clothing, the"

1564,XV.,"event of her refusing, throws a spear at her. The early life of a young"
1565,XV.,woman at all celebrated for beauty is generally one continued series of
1566,XV.,"captivities to different masters, of ghastly wounds, of wandering in"
1567,XV.,"strange families, of rapid flights, of bad treatment from other females"
1568,XV.,"amongst whom she is brought, a stranger, by her captor; and rarely do"
1569,XV.,you see a form of unusual grace and elegance but it is marked and

1582,XV.,"by statements made by other travellers. Woman, owing to her maternal"

1738,XVI.,"But Professor Huxley speaks, more humanly, of “... such a peasant woman"

1740,XVI.,"with mind bent only on her home; but yet, without effort and without"
1741,XVI.,"thought, knitting for her children. Now stockings are good and"
1742,XVI.,"comfortable things, and the children will undoubtedly be much the better"
1743,XVI.,"for them, but surely it would be short-sighted, to say the least of it,"

1756,XVI.,In even so sedate and usually dispassionate a physiologist and
1757,XVI.,"philosopher as Charles Darwin, the masculine sex-bias is so ingrained"
1758,XVI.,and so ingenuous that he strives to disparage and contemn the notorious
1759,XVI.,mental quickness or intuition of woman by saying:—“It is generally
1760,XVI.,"admitted that with woman the powers of intuition, of rapid perception,"
1761,XVI.,"and perhaps of imitation, are more strongly marked than in man; but"
1762,XVI.,"some, at least, of these faculties are characteristic of the lower"
1763,XVI.,"races, and therefore of a past and lower state of civilisation.”—(“The"
1764,XVI.,"Descent of Man,” Chap. XIX.)."
1765,XVI.,
1766,XVI.,His unconscious sex-bias apparently overlooked the pregnant and very
1767,XVI.,pertinent caution which he had himself uttered in a previous
1768,XVI.,"work:—“Useful organs, however little they may be developed, unless we"
1769,XVI.,"have reason to suppose that they were formerly more highly developed,"
1770,XVI.,ought not to be considered as rudimentary. They may be in a nascent
1771,XVI.,"condition, and in progress towards further development. Rudimentary"
1772,XVI.,"organs, on the other hand, are either quite useless, such as teeth which"
1773,XVI.,"never cut through the gums, or, almost useless, such as the wings of an"
1774,XVI.,"ostrich, which serve merely as sails.... It is, however, often difficult"
1775,XVI.,"to distinguish between rudimentary and nascent organs, for we can judge"
1776,XVI.,"only by analogy whether a part is capable of further development, in"
1777,XVI.,which case alone it deserves to be called nascent.”—(“Origin of
1778,XVI.,"Species,” Chap. XIV.)."
1779,XVI.,
1780,XVI.,But surely Darwin would admit that experiment in capacity of education
1781,XVI.,"and development was as worthy evidence as “analogy,” and would further"
1782,XVI.,acknowledge how little effort in this direction had ever been made with
1783,XVI.,woman. Buckle would seem to be far nearer the truth in ascribing to
1784,XVI.,"woman an unconscious deductive form of reasoning, as against the slow"
1785,XVI.,and studied inductive process to which man is so generally trained to be
1786,XVI.,a slave.—(See Buckle’s Essay on the “Influence of Women on the Progress

1851,XVII.,
1852,XVII.,"In a periodical published in Shanghai, Dr. Faber, a well-known scholar,"
1853,XVII.,writes (1891) a paper on the status of women in China. He refers
1854,XVII.,especially to the theoretical position assigned to women by the Chinese
1855,XVII.,Classics. These lay down the different dogmas on the subject:
1856,XVII.,
1857,XVII.,“1.—Women are as different in nature from man as earth is from heaven.
1858,XVII.,
1859,XVII.,"“2.—Dualism, not only in body form, but in the very essence of nature,"
1860,XVII.,is indicated and proclaimed by Chinese moralists of all times
1861,XVII.,"and creed. The male belongs to _yang_, the female to _yin_."
1862,XVII.,
1863,XVII.,"“3.—Death and all other evils have their origin in the _yin_, or"
1864,XVII.,female principle; life and prosperity come from its subjection
1865,XVII.,to the _yang_ or male principle; and it is therefore regarded as
1866,XVII.,a law of nature that women should be kept under the control of
1867,XVII.,"men, and not be allowed any will of their own."
1868,XVII.,
1869,XVII.,"“4.—Women, indeed, are human beings, (!) but they are of a lower state"
1870,XVII.,"than men, and can never attain to full equality with them."
1871,XVII.,
1872,XVII.,"“5.—The aim of female education, therefore, is perfect submission, not"
1873,XVII.,cultivation and development of mind.
1874,XVII.,
1875,XVII.,“6.—Women cannot have any happiness of their own; they have to live
1876,XVII.,and work for men.
1877,XVII.,
1878,XVII.,"“7.—Only as the mother of a son, as the continuator of the direct line"
1879,XVII.,"of a family, can a woman escape from her degradation and become"
1880,XVII.,to a certain degree her husband’s equal; but then only in
1881,XVII.,"household affairs, especially the female department, and in the"
1882,XVII.,ancestral hall.
1883,XVII.,
1884,XVII.,"“8.—In the other world, woman’s condition remains exactly the same,"
1885,XVII.,for the same laws of existence apply. She is not the equal of
1886,XVII.,"her husband; she belongs to him, and is dependent for her"
1887,XVII.,happiness on the sacrifice offered by her descendants.

1897,JAPAN.,
1898,JAPAN.,“There is one supreme maxim upon which the conduct of a well-bred woman
1899,JAPAN.,"is made to turn, and this is ‘obedience.’ Life, the Japanese girl is"
1900,JAPAN.,"taught, divides itself into three stages of obedience. In youth she is"
1901,JAPAN.,to obey her father; in marriage her husband; in widowhood her eldest
1902,JAPAN.,son. Hence her preparation for life is always preparation for service.
1903,JAPAN.,The marriage of the Japanese girl usually takes place when she is about
1904,JAPAN.,seventeen. It is contrary to all custom that she should have any voice
1905,JAPAN.,"in it. Once married, she passes from her father’s household into the"
1906,JAPAN.,"household of her husband, and her period of self-abnegation begins. Her"
1907,JAPAN.,own family is to be as nothing to her. Her duty is to charm the
1908,JAPAN.,"existence of her husband, and to please his relations. Custom demands"
1909,JAPAN.,"that she shall always smile upon him, and that she shall carefully hide"
1910,JAPAN.,"from him any signs of bad humour, jealousy, or physical pain.”—Tinseau"
1911,JAPAN.,"(quoted in _Review of Reviews_, Vol. IV., p. 282.)"
1912,JAPAN.,
1913,JAPAN.,Note well the last two words of the above quotation; they have a bearing
1914,JAPAN.,"on much that will have to be said presently. Meanwhile, we read from"
1915,JAPAN.,"another writer: “The expression, _res angusta domi_, might have been"
1916,JAPAN.,"invented for Japan, so narrow of necessity is the wife’s home life. The"
1917,JAPAN.,"husband mixes with the world, the wife does not; the husband has been"
1918,JAPAN.,"somewhat inspired, and his thoughts widened by his intercourse with"
1919,JAPAN.,"foreigners, the wife has not met them. The husband has more or less"
1920,JAPAN.,acquaintance with western learning; the wife has none. Affection between
1921,JAPAN.,"the two, within the limits which unequal intellectuality ruthlessly"
1922,JAPAN.,"prescribes, there well may be, but the love which comes of a perfect"
1923,JAPAN.,"intimacy, of mutual knowledge and common aspiration, there can rarely"
1924,JAPAN.,be. The very vocabulary of romantic love does not exist in Japanese; _a
1925,JAPAN.,"fortiori_, there is little of the fact.” Yet, under the influence of"
1926,JAPAN.,"western civilisation, these things are changing rapidly, and Mr. Norman,"
1927,JAPAN.,"the commissioner of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, further relates that “The"
1928,JAPAN.,generation that is now growing up will be very different. Not only will
1929,JAPAN.,"the men of it be more western, but the women also. As girls they will"
1930,JAPAN.,"have been to schools like our schools at home, and they will have"
1931,JAPAN.,"learned English, and history, and geography, and science, and foreign"
1932,JAPAN.,"music; perhaps, even, something of politics and political economy. They"
1933,JAPAN.,"will know something of ‘society,’ as we now use the term, and will both"
1934,JAPAN.,seek it and make it. The old home life will become unbearable to the
1935,JAPAN.,"woman, and she will demand the right of choosing her husband just as"
1936,JAPAN.,much as he chooses her. Then the rest will be easy.”
1937,JAPAN.,
1938,JAPAN.,"The harsh and restrained position, both of Japanese and Chinese women,"
1939,JAPAN.,is frequently attributed to Confucianism; yet the matter does not seem
1940,JAPAN.,"to be of any one creed, but rather of every religious creed. Thus Mrs."
1941,JAPAN.,"Reichardt tells us, concerning Mahommedan women and Mahommedan married"
1942,JAPAN.,"life, that—"
1943,JAPAN.,
1944,JAPAN.,“A Mahommedan girl is brought up with the idea that she has nothing to
1945,JAPAN.,do with love. It is _ayib_ (shame) for her to love her husband. She dare
1946,JAPAN.,not do it if she would. What he asks and expects of her is to tremble
1947,JAPAN.,"before him, and yield him unquestioning obedience. I have _seen_ a"

1959,INDIA.,The _Bombay Guardian_ calls attention to an extraordinary book which is
1960,INDIA.,"being circulated (early in 1891) broadcast, as a prize-book in the"
1961,INDIA.,Government Girls’ School in the Bombay Presidency. The following
1962,INDIA.,quotations are given as specimens of the teachings set forth in the
1963,INDIA.,book:—
1964,INDIA.,
1965,INDIA.,"“If the husband of a virtuous woman be ugly, of good or bad disposition,"
1966,INDIA.,"diseased, fiendish, irascible, or a drunkard, old, stupid, dumb, blind,"
1967,INDIA.,"deaf, hot-tempered, poor, extremely covetous, a slanderer, cowardly,"
1968,INDIA.,"perfidious, and immoral, nevertheless she ought to worship him as God,"
1969,INDIA.,"with mind, speech, and person."
1970,INDIA.,
1971,INDIA.,“The wife who gives an angry answer to her husband will become a village
1972,INDIA.,"pariah dog; she will also become a jackal, and live in an uninhabited"
1973,INDIA.,desert.
1974,INDIA.,
1975,INDIA.,“The woman who eats sweetmeats without sharing them with her husband
1976,INDIA.,"will become a hen-owl, living in a hollow tree.—(Conf. Note VI., 8.)"
1977,INDIA.,
1978,INDIA.,“The woman who walks alone without her husband will become a
1979,INDIA.,filth-eating village sow.
1980,INDIA.,
1981,INDIA.,“The woman who speaks disrespectfully to her husband will be dumb in the
1982,INDIA.,next incarnation.
1983,INDIA.,
1984,INDIA.,“The woman who hates her husband’s relations will become from birth to
1985,INDIA.,"birth a musk-rat, living in filth."
1986,INDIA.,
1987,INDIA.,“She who is always jealous of her husband’s concubine will be childless
1988,INDIA.,in the next incarnation.”
1989,INDIA.,
1990,INDIA.,"To illustrate the blessed result of a wife’s subserviency, a story is"
1991,INDIA.,"told of “the great reward that came to the wife of an ill-tempered,"
1992,INDIA.,"diseased, and wicked Brahmin, who served her husband with a slavish"
1993,INDIA.,"obedience, and even went the length of carrying him on her own shoulders"
1994,INDIA.,to visit his mistress.”
1995,INDIA.,
1996,INDIA.,"So quotes the _Woman’s Journal_ of Boston, Mass., and says in comment"
1997,INDIA.,thereon:—“The British Government in India has bound itself not to
1998,INDIA.,"interfere with the religion of the natives, but it certainly ought not"
1999,INDIA.,to inculcate in Government schools the worst doctrines of heathenism.”
2000,INDIA.,
2001,INDIA.,"Yet, again, are these Hindoo, or Japanese, or Chinese doctrines simply"
2002,INDIA.,the precepts of “heathenism” alone? Buckle quotes for us the following
2003,INDIA.,"passage from the Nonconformist “Fergusson on the Epistles,” 1656, p."
2004,INDIA.,242:—“There is not any husband to whom this honour of submission is not
2005,INDIA.,"due. No personal infirmity, frowardness of nature, no, not even on the"
2006,INDIA.,"point of religion, doth deprive him of it.”"
2007,INDIA.,
2008,INDIA.,Much the same teaching is continued a century later in the noted Dr.
2009,INDIA.,"Gregory’s “A Father’s Legacy to his Daughters”; and again, hideously"
2010,INDIA.,"true is the picture which Mill has to draw, in 1869:—“Above all, a"
2011,INDIA.,"female slave has (in Christian countries) an admitted right, and is"
2012,INDIA.,considered under a moral obligation to refuse to her master the last
2013,INDIA.,familiarity. Not so the wife; however brutal a tyrant she may
2014,INDIA.,"unfortunately be chained to, though she may know that he hates her,"
2015,INDIA.,"though it may be his daily pleasure to torture her, and though she may"
2016,INDIA.,"feel it impossible not to loathe him, he can claim from her and enforce"
2017,INDIA.,"the lowest degradation of a human being, that of being made the"
2018,INDIA.,instrument of an animal function contrary to her inclinations.... No
2019,INDIA.,"amount of ill-usage, without adultery superadded, will in England free a"
2020,INDIA.,"wife from her tormentor.”—(“The Subjection of Women,” pp. 57, 59.)"
2021,INDIA.,
2022,INDIA.,"As to how far public feeling, if not law, has amended some of these"
2023,INDIA.,"conditions, see Note XXXVI., 6. Meanwhile, as an evidence of what is the"
2024,INDIA.,"“orthodox” opinion and sentiment at this present day, it may be noted"
2025,INDIA.,"that Cardinal Manning wrote in the _Dublin Review_, July, 1891:—“A woman"
2026,INDIA.,enters for life into a sacred contract with a man before God at the
2027,INDIA.,"altar to fulfil to him the duties of wife, mother, and head of his home."
2028,INDIA.,"Is it lawful for her, even with his consent, to make afterwards a second"
2029,INDIA.,contract for so many shillings a week with a millowner whereby she
2030,INDIA.,"becomes unable to provide her husband’s food, train up her children, or"
2031,INDIA.,do the duties of her home? It is no question of the lawfulness of
2032,INDIA.,"gaining a few more shillings for the expenses of a family, but of the"
2033,INDIA.,"lawfulness of breaking a prior contract, the most solemn between man and"
2034,INDIA.,woman. No arguments of expediency can be admitted. It is an obligation
2035,INDIA.,of conscience to which all things must give way. The duties of home must
2036,INDIA.,first be done” (by the woman) “then other questions may be entertained.”
2037,INDIA.,
2038,INDIA.,Are not these English injunctions to womanly and wifely slavery as
2039,INDIA.,trenchant and merciless as any ascribed to so-called “heathenism”? And
2040,INDIA.,is it not the fuller truth that the spirit of the male teaching against
2041,INDIA.,"woman is the same all the world over, and no mere matter of creed—which"
2042,INDIA.,"is nevertheless made the convenient vehicle for such teaching; and that,"
2043,INDIA.,"in brief, the precepts of womanly and wifely servitude are blind,"

2071,XVIII.,"for he writes of them not only in a kindly spirit, but even with"
2072,XVIII.,"enthusiasm for their healthy looks, graceful figures, and good conduct."
2073,XVIII.,We need not follow his description of the processes in which the women
2074,XVIII.,"of the colliery are employed, but we may say in passing that Mr. Wakeman"
2075,XVIII.,was astonished by the ‘wonderful quickness of eye and movement’ shown by
2076,XVIII.,"the ‘screeners,’ and by the ‘superb physical development’ and agility of"
2077,XVIII.,the ‘fillers.’ He had expected to find them ‘the most forlorn creatures

2093,XVIII.,to how far woman has been hindered and “handicapped” by her conventional
2094,XVIII.,"attire, and not by her want of physical strength or courage, is reported"
2095,XVIII.,"from time to time in the public prints, as witness the following,"
2096,XVIII.,"published generally in the English newspapers of 14th Oct., 1891:—"
2097,XVIII.,
2098,XVIII.,"“Not long since a well-known European courier, having grown grey in"
2099,XVIII.,"his occupation, fell ill, and like others similarly afflicted, was"
2100,XVIII.,compelled to call in a doctor. This gentleman was completely taken by
2101,XVIII.,surprise on discovering that his patient was a female. Then the sick
2102,XVIII.,woman—who had piloted numerous English and American families through
2103,XVIII.,"the land of the Latin, the Turk, and others, and led timid tourists"
2104,XVIII.,safely through many imaginary dangers—confessed that she had worn
2105,XVIII.,men’s clothes for forty years. She stated that her reasons for this
2106,XVIII.,"masquerade were that having, at the age of thirteen, been left a"
2107,XVIII.,"friendless orphan, she had become convinced, after futile struggling"
2108,XVIII.,"for employment, that many of the obstacles in her path could be swept"
2109,XVIII.,away by discarding her proper garments and assuming the _rôle_ and
2110,XVIII.,"attire of masculine youth. This she did. She closely cut her hair,"
2111,XVIII.,"bought boy’s clothes, put them on, and sallied forth in the world to"
2112,XVIII.,seek her fortune. With the change of dress seems to have come a change
2113,XVIII.,"of luck, for she quickly found employment, and being an apt scholar,"
2114,XVIII.,"and facile at learning languages, was enabled after a time to obtain a"
2115,XVIII.,"position as courier, and, but for her unfortunate illness, it is"
2116,XVIII.,tolerably certain that the truth would never have been revealed during
2117,XVIII.,her lifetime.”
2118,XVIII.,
2119,XVIII.,"In the early days of April, 1892, the Vienna correspondent of the"
2120,XVIII.,_Standard_ reported that—
2121,XVIII.,
2122,XVIII.,"“On the 30th ult., there died in Hungary, at about the same hour, two"
2123,XVIII.,"ladies who served in 1848 in the Revolutionary Army, and fought in"
2124,XVIII.,"several of the fiercest battles, dressed in military uniform. One of"
2125,XVIII.,"them was several times promoted, and, under the name of Karl, attained"
2126,XVIII.,"the rank of First Lieutenant of Hussars. At this point, however, an"
2127,XVIII.,artillery major stopped her military career by marrying her. The other
2128,XVIII.,"fought under the name of Josef, and was decorated for valour in the"
2129,XVIII.,"field. She married long after the campaign. A Hungarian paper,"
2130,XVIII.,"referring to the two cases, says that about a dozen women fought in"
2131,XVIII.,1848 in the insurrectionary ranks.”
2132,XVIII.,
2133,XVIII.,Somewhat more detailed particulars concerning “Lieutenant Karl” were
2134,XVIII.,"afterwards given by the _Manchester Guardian_ (June 6, 1892), as"
2135,XVIII.,follows:—
2136,XVIII.,
2137,XVIII.,"“The Austrian _Volkszeitung_ announces the death of Frau Marie Hoche,"
2138,XVIII.,who has had a most singular and romantic career. Her maiden name was
2139,XVIII.,"Lepstuk. In the momentous year of 1848 Marie Lepstuk, who was then"
2140,XVIII.,"eighteen years of age, joined the German legion at Vienna; then,"
2141,XVIII.,"returning home, she adopted the name of Karl and joined the Tyroler"
2142,XVIII.,Jager Regiment of the revolutionary army. She showed great bravery in
2143,XVIII.,"the battlefield, received the medallion, and was raised to the rank of"
2144,XVIII.,"lieutenant. A wound compelled her to go into hospital, but after her"
2145,XVIII.,recovery she joined the Hussars. As a reward for exceeding bravery she
2146,XVIII.,was next made oberlieutenant on the field. Soon after this her sex was
2147,XVIII.,"discovered, but a major fell in love with her, and they were married."
2148,XVIII.,"At Vilagos both were taken prisoners, and while in the fortress she"
2149,XVIII.,gave birth to her first child. After the major’s death she was
2150,XVIII.,remarried to Oberlieutenant Hoche. For the past few years Frau Hoche
2151,XVIII.,"has been in needy circumstances, but an appeal from Jokai brought"
2152,XVIII.,relief.”
2153,XVIII.,
2154,XVIII.,All of which goes far to discredit M. Michelet’s theory that women are
2155,XVIII.,"“born invalids,” an assertion which Dr. Julia Mitchell “stigmatises"
2156,XVIII.,"naturally enough as ‘all nonsense,’” and is thus approved—with a strange"
2157,XVIII.,"magnanimity—by the _British Medical Journal_.—(See _Pall Mall Gazette_,"
2158,XVIII.,"April 29, 1892.)"
2159,XVIII.,
2160,XVIII.,The “incapacity of women for military service” has been of late days
2161,XVIII.,"continually quoted as a bar to their right of citizenship, as far as the"
2162,XVIII.,Parliamentary Franchise is concerned. In the face of the foregoing
2163,XVIII.,"cases, and of the fact that every mother risks her life in becoming a"
2164,XVIII.,"mother, while very few men, indeed, risk theirs on the battlefield, it"
2165,XVIII.,might be thought that the fallacious argument would have perished from
2166,XVIII.,shame and inanition long ago. But the inconsistencies of
2167,XVIII.,"partly-cultivated, masculine, one-sexed intellect are as stubborn as"
2168,XVIII.,blind.

2182,XIX.,"not only entitled to the hope, but logically compelled to the assurance"

2228,XXI.,further. To them may be offered the incident and words of the late Dr.

2230,XXI.,"committee on the question of child-life insurance, said:—“In this matter"
2231,XXI.,"we have to count with two things: first, almost all our facts are"
2232,XXI.,"secrets of the bedchamber; and, secondly, we are opposed by great vested"

2253,XXII.,
2254,XXII.,Somewhat as to these ancient conditions may be gathered from the
2255,XXII.,position in India at the present day. Read the following:—“The practice
2256,XXII.,"of early marriages by Hindoos I was, of course, informed of by reading"
2257,XXII.,"before coming to India, but its mention in books was always coupled with"
2258,XXII.,the assertion that in India girls reach puberty at a much earlier age
2259,XXII.,"than in cold climates. Judge, therefore, of my surprise to find that so"
2260,XXII.,"far from Hindoo girls being precocious in physical development, they are"
2261,XXII.,much behind in this respect; that a Hindoo girl of fifteen is about the
2262,XXII.,"equal of an English child of eleven, instead of the reverse, and that"
2263,XXII.,the statements made to the contrary by Englishmen who have no
2264,XXII.,"opportunity of becoming acquainted with Hindoo family life, were totally"
2265,XXII.,misleading. In the first place they were under the impression that
2266,XXII.,"marriage never takes place before puberty, and, secondly, they accepted"
2267,XXII.,"the Hindoo view as to what constitutes puberty. You know that,"
2268,XXII.,"unfortunately, they were misled as regards the first point. I hope to"
2269,XXII.,show you that in the second place the idea which they accepted as
2270,XXII.,"correct is a totally mistaken one.”—Mrs. Pechey Phipson, M.D. (Address"
2271,XXII.,to the Hindoos of Bombay on the subject of child-marriage; delivered at
2272,XXII.,"the Hall of the Prarthana Somaj, Bombay, on the 11th Oct., 1890)."
2273,XXII.,
2274,XXII.,
2275,XXII.,2.—“... _sexual wrong_.”
2276,XXII.,
2277,XXII.,"“As regards the marriage of girls before even what is called puberty, I"
2278,XXII.,"can hardly trust myself to speak, so strongly are my feelings those of"
2279,XXII.,all Western—may I not say of all civilised?—people in looking upon it as
2280,XXII.,"actually criminal. Ah! gentlemen, those of you who are conversant with"
2281,XXII.,"such cases as I have seen, cases like those of Phulmoni Dossee, which"
2282,XXII.,has just now stirred your hearts to insist upon some change in the
2283,XXII.,"existing law, and others where a life-long decrepitude has followed, to"
2284,XXII.,"which death itself were far preferable, do you not feel with me that"
2285,XXII.,penal servitude is not too hard a punishment for such brutality? I am
2286,XXII.,glad to think that a very large section of Hindoo men think with me. I
2287,XXII.,"have been repeatedly spoken to on the subject, and members even of those"
2288,XXII.,"castes which are most guilty in this matter, have expressed to me a wish"
2289,XXII.,that Government would interfere and put a stop to the practice.”—Mrs.

2560,XXIII.,"virility in man; the beard, the male voice, the change in figure, and"
2561,XXIII.,the change in disposition; and in girls there is a long period of
2562,XXIII.,"development in the bust, in the hips, in bone and muscle, changes which"
2563,XXIII.,take years for their proper accomplishment before the girl can be said
2564,XXIII.,to have grown into a woman. All this is not as a rule completed before
2565,XXIII.,the age of twenty. Woman’s form is not well developed before she is
2566,XXIII.,"twenty years old; her pelvis, which has been called the laboratory of"

2568,XXIII.,maternity is not desirable. If the demand is made on the system before

2582,XXIII.,
2583,XXIII.,"Dr. John Thorburn, in his “Lecture introductory to the Summer Course on"
2584,XXIII.,"Obstetric Medicine,” Victoria University, Manchester, 1884, says:—“Let"
2585,XXIII.,me briefly remind you of what occurs at each menstrual period. During
2586,XXIII.,nearly one week out of every four there occurs the characteristic
2587,XXIII.,"phenomenon of menstruation, which in itself has some temporary"
2588,XXIII.,"_impoverishing effect_, though, in health, nature speedily provides the"
2589,XXIII.,means of recuperation. Along with this we have a marked disturbance in
2590,XXIII.,"the circulation of the pelvis, leading to alterations in the weight,"
2591,XXIII.,"conformation, and position of the _uterus_. We have also tissue changes"
2592,XXIII.,"occurring, _not perhaps yet thoroughly understood_, but leading to"
2593,XXIII.,"ruptures in the ovary, and to exfoliation of the uterine lining"
2594,XXIII.,"membrane, _a kind of modified abortion, in fact_. These changes in most"
2595,XXIII.,"instances are accompanied by signs of pain and discomfort, which, if"
2596,XXIII.,"they were not periodic and physiological, would be considered as"
2597,XXIII.,symptoms of disease.”
2598,XXIII.,
2599,XXIII.,(The italics are not in the original.) Here is certainly cogent evidence
2600,XXIII.,"of “abnormal fruit of birth,” and the learned doctor seems to be on the"
2601,XXIII.,verge of making the involuntary discovery. But he follows the usual
2602,XXIII.,"professional attempt (see Note XXX., 4) to class menstruation as a"
2603,XXIII.,"physiological and not a pathological fact; as a natural, painful"
2604,XXIII.,"incident, and not an acquired painful consequence. His half-declared"
2605,XXIII.,"argument, that, because an epoch of pain is periodic it is therefore not"
2606,XXIII.,"symptomatic of disease, is a theory as unsatisfactory as novel."
2607,XXIII.,
2608,XXIII.,"_Id._... Some of the facts connected with parthenogenesis, alternate"
2609,XXIII.,"generation, the impregnation of insects, &c., passed on through more"
2610,XXIII.,"than one generation, would show by analogy this class of phenomena not"
2611,XXIII.,"extranatural or unprecedented, but abnormal and capable of rectification"
2612,XXIII.,or reduction to pristine normality or non-existence. The fact of
2613,XXIII.,"occasional instances of absence of menstruation, yet with a perfect"
2614,XXIII.,"potentiality of child-bearing, indicates this latter possibility. That"
2615,XXIII.,the male being did not correspondingly suffer in personal physiological
2616,XXIII.,sequence is explicable on the ground that the masculine bodily function
2617,XXIII.,of parentage cannot be subjected to equal forced sexual abuse; though in
2618,XXIII.,the male sex also there is indication that excess may leave hereditary
2619,XXIII.,"functional trace. And that, again, a somewhat analogous physical"

2709,XXIV.,
2710,XXIV.,Par. 9. “... There has already been a provision in the Indian Penal
2711,XXIV.,"Code, passed more than thirty years ago, that a man having sexual"

2714,XXIV.,"of _rape_, and shall be liable to transportation for life, or to"
2715,XXIV.,rigorous or simple imprisonment for ten years.”
2716,XXIV.,
2717,XXIV.,"Par. 10. “From this it follows that, under the Penal Code a man having"

2719,XXIV.,"she is _above ten_ years of age, shall not be considered to have"
2720,XXIV.,committed the offence of _rape_. But the Act that has just been
2721,XXIV.,"passed, in amendment of the above provision in the Penal Code,"
2722,XXIV.,"_raises_ the age of consent from _ten_ to _twelve_ years, and provides"
2723,XXIV.,"that a man having sexual intercourse with his own wife, even with her"
2724,XXIV.,"consent, shall be considered to be guilty of the offence of rape, if"
2725,XXIV.,the wife be of any age under _twelve completed years_. This is all the
2726,XXIV.,change that has been made in the law.”
2727,XXIV.,
2728,XXIV.,"Par. 11. “It having been ascertained, from various sources, that in"
2729,XXIV.,some parts of the country husbands cohabit with their wives before
2730,XXIV.,"they have attained to the age of _twelve_ years, and even before they"
2731,XXIV.,"have arrived at _puberty_, the result of such intercourse being in"
2732,XXIV.,"many cases to cause injury to the health, and even danger to the life"
2733,XXIV.,"of the girls, and to generate internal maladies which make them"
2734,XXIV.,"miserable throughout their lives, and such a state of things having"
2735,XXIV.,"come to the notice of Government, they have considered it their duty"
2736,XXIV.,"to put a stop to it, and this is the object of the present"
2737,XXIV.,legislation.”
2738,XXIV.,
2739,XXIV.,Par. 12. “The law does not interfere with the age at which a girl may
2740,XXIV.,"be married, but simply prohibits sexual intercourse with her by her"
2741,XXIV.,husband before she is _twelve_ years of age.”
2742,XXIV.,
2743,XXIV.,Par. 13. “It is therefore _incumbent_ upon all husbands and their
2744,XXIV.,guardians (if they are very young and inexperienced lads) to be very
2745,XXIV.,careful that sexual intercourse does not take place until the
2746,XXIV.,girl-wife has _passed_ the age of _twelve_ years. It will also be the
2747,XXIV.,duty of the guardians of the girl-wife not to allow her husband to
2748,XXIV.,cohabit with her until she has attained that age.”
2749,XXIV.,
2750,XXIV.,"Par. 17. “... The Mahomedan law (_i.e._, religious law) distinctly"
2751,XXIV.,sanctions consummation of marriage _only_ when the wife has reached
2752,XXIV.,"puberty, and has besides attained such physical development as renders"
2753,XXIV.,"her fit for sexual intercourse, and it is _not imperative_ upon a"
2754,XXIV.,Mahomedan husband to consummate marriage with his wife when she is
2755,XXIV.,_under_ the age of _twelve_ years. Even in those rare cases in which
2756,XXIV.,the wife attains to puberty and the necessary physical development
2757,XXIV.,"before the age of _twelve_, a Mahomedan husband _may_, without"
2758,XXIV.,"infringing any canon of the Mahommedan Ecclesiastical Law, _abstain_"
2759,XXIV.,from consummating his marriage with her _until_ she attains that age.
2760,XXIV.,
2761,XXIV.,Par. 18. “The above will clearly show that the Act recently passed by
2762,XXIV.,"the Legislature does not, in any way, interfere with the Mahomedan"
2763,XXIV.,"religion, and _no_ Mahomedan husband will be considered to have"

2776,XXIV.,"feeling, supported by the growing sentiment of the more intelligent and"
2777,XXIV.,"educated of the native population, has effected even so slight an"
2778,XXIV.,"amelioration of law and custom, and we may hope for and press forward to"
2779,XXIV.,further improvement. Though the utterance quoted above is only that of
2780,XXIV.,"the Mahomedan section, it is, of course, understood that the law does"
2781,XXIV.,"not apply or point to them alone, but to all the peoples and sects of"
2782,XXIV.,India; and that the approval of this legislation is also general among
2783,XXIV.,"the enlightened of those other creeds. (See end of Note XVII., 8.)"
2784,XXIV.,
2785,XXIV.,Singular confirmatory evidence as to the distressing prevalence of this
2786,XXIV.,child-marriage is incidentally given in the following paragraph from the
2787,XXIV.,"_Times_ of 31st March, 1892:—"
2788,XXIV.,
2789,XXIV.,“A correspondent of the _Times of India_ mentions some odd instances
2790,XXIV.,of minor difficulties which have occurred in the working of the
2791,XXIV.,"amended Factory Act, which came into force in India at the"
2792,XXIV.,commencement of the present year. The limit of age for ‘full-timers’
2793,XXIV.,"in factories is fixed at fourteen years, and as very few native"
2794,XXIV.,"operatives know their children’s ages, or even their own, the medical"
2795,XXIV.,"officer has, in passing lads and girls for work, to judge the age as"
2796,XXIV.,"best he can—generally, as in the case of horses, by examining their"
2797,XXIV.,"teeth. If he concludes that they are under fourteen, he reduces them"
2798,XXIV.,to ‘half-timers.’ In one Bombay mill recently a number of girls were
2799,XXIV.,"thus sent back as under age who were actually mothers, and several"
2800,XXIV.,boys who were fathers were also reduced; and one of the latter was the
2801,XXIV.,"father, it is said, of three children. The case of these lads is"
2802,XXIV.,"particularly hard, for, with a wife and child, or perhaps children, to"
2803,XXIV.,"support, life, on the pay of a ‘half-timer,’ must be a terrible"
2804,XXIV.,struggle.”
2805,XXIV.,
2806,XXIV.,Lest it should be objected that such abuses—with their consequences—as
2807,XXIV.,"have been instanced in India, are peculiar to that country or"
2808,XXIV.,"civilisation, and that their discussion has therefore no bearing on our"
2809,XXIV.,"practices in England, and the physical consequences ensuant here, it"
2810,XXIV.,will be salutary to recall what has been our own national conduct in
2811,XXIV.,this matter of enforcement of immature physical relations on girl
2812,XXIV.,children or “wives” within times of by no means distant date. Blackstone
2813,XXIV.,"tells in his “Commentaries,” Book II., Chap. VIII., that “The wife must"
2814,XXIV.,"be above nine years old at her husband’s death, otherwise she shall not"
2815,XXIV.,"be endowed, though in Bracton’s time the age was indefinite, and dower"
2816,XXIV.,"was then only due ‘si uxor possit dotem promereri, _et virum"
2817,XXIV.,"sustinere_.’” Whereupon Ed. Christian makes the following note, worthy"
2818,XXIV.,of the most careful meditation:—“Lord Coke informs us that ‘if the wife
2819,XXIV.,"be past the age of nine years at the time of her husband’s death, she"
2820,XXIV.,"shall be endowed, of what age soever her husband be, albeit he were but"
2821,XXIV.,"_four_ years old. Quia junior non potest dotem promereri, _et virum"
2822,XXIV.,"sustinere_.’ (Coke on Litt., 33.) This we are told by that grave and"
2823,XXIV.,reverend judge without any remark of surprise or reprobation. But it
2824,XXIV.,"confirms the observation of Montesquieu in the ‘Spirit of Laws,’ Book"
2825,XXIV.,"XXVI., Chap. III. ‘There has been,’ says he, ‘much talk of a law in"
2826,XXIV.,England which permitted girls seven years old to choose a husband. This
2827,XXIV.,law was shocking two ways; it had no regard to the time when Nature
2828,XXIV.,"gives maturity to the understanding, nor to the time when she gives"
2829,XXIV.,"maturity to the body.’ It is abundantly clear, both from our law and"
2830,XXIV.,"history, that formerly such early marriages were contracted as in the"
2831,XXIV.,present times are neither attempted nor thought of.
2832,XXIV.,
2833,XXIV.,“This was probably owing to the right which the lord possessed of
2834,XXIV.,putting up to sale the marriage of his infant tenant. He no doubt took
2835,XXIV.,"the first opportunity of prostituting (_i.e._, selling in marriage) the"
2836,XXIV.,"infant to his own interest, without any regard to age or inclinations."
2837,XXIV.,And thus what was so frequently practised and permitted by the law would
2838,XXIV.,cease even in other instances to be considered with abhorrence. _If the
2839,XXIV.,"marriage of a female was delayed till she was sixteen, this benefit was"
2840,XXIV.,entirely lost to the lord her guardian._
2841,XXIV.,
2842,XXIV.,"“Even the 18 Eliz., cap. 7, which makes it a capital crime to abuse a"
2843,XXIV.,"consenting female child under the age of ten years, seems to leave an"
2844,XXIV.,exception for these marriages by declaring only the _carnal and
2845,XXIV.,unlawful_ knowledge of such woman-child to be a felony. Hence the
2846,XXIV.,abolition of the feudal wardships and marriage at the Restoration may
2847,XXIV.,perhaps have contributed not less to the improvement of the morals than
2848,XXIV.,"of the liberty of the people.”—(Blackstone’s Comm., Christian’s Edition,"

2853,XXIV.,
2854,XXIV.,"“Manner,” or “custom” is the early Biblical definition for this habit"
2855,XXIV.,"(_vide_ Gen. xviii. 11, and xxxi. 35). It may be noticed that the word"
2856,XXIV.,is not rendered or translated as “nature.” It is also called “sickness”
2857,XXIV.,(Lev. xx. 18); and “pollution” (Ezek. xxii. 10). See also Note XXV. 8.
2858,XXIV.,
2859,XXIV.,The authorised version of the Bible is here referred to. The euphemisms
2860,XXIV.,attempted in the recent revised version as amendments of some of these

2869,XXV.,"Revolting was the shock to the writer, coming, some years ago, with"
2870,XXV.,"unprejudiced and ingenuous mind, to the study of the so-called “Diseases"
2871,XXV.,"of Women,” on finding that nearly the whole of these special “diseases,”"
2872,XXV.,"including menstruation, were due, directly or collaterally, to one form"
2873,XXV.,or other of _masculine_ excess or abuse. Here is a nearly coincident
2874,XXV.,"opinion, afterwards met with:—“The diseases peculiar to women are so"
2875,XXV.,"many, of so frequent occurrence, and of such severity, that half the"
2876,XXV.,"time of the medical profession is devoted to their care, and more than"
2877,XXV.,half its revenues depend upon them. We have libraries of books upon
2878,XXV.,"them, special professorships in our medical colleges, and hosts of"
2879,XXV.,doctors who give them their exclusive attention.... The books and
2880,XXV.,professors are all at fault. They have no knowledge of the causes or
2881,XXV.,"nature of these diseases” (or at least they do not publish it, or act on"
2882,XXV.,"it), “and no idea of their proper treatment. Women are everywhere"
2883,XXV.,outraged and abused. When the full chapter of woman’s wrongs and
2884,XXV.,"sufferings is written, the world will be horrified at the hideous"
2885,XXV.,"spectacle....”—T. L. Nichols, M.D. (“Esoteric Anthropology,” p. 198)."
2886,XXV.,
2887,XXV.,"So, again, in speaking of menorrhagia:—“The causes of this disease,"
2888,XXV.,"whatever they are, must be removed. Thousands of women are consigned to"
2889,XXV.,"premature graves; some by the morbid excesses of their own passions, but"
2890,XXV.,far more by the sensual and selfish indulgences of those who claim the
2891,XXV.,"legal right to murder them in this manner, whom no law of homicide can"

2909,XXV.,"Turin (at the International Congress of Psychology, London), in which"
2910,XXV.,occurs the following:—“It must be observed that woman was exposed to
2911,XXV.,"more pains than man, because man imposed submission and often even"
2912,XXV.,"slavery upon her. As a girl, she had to undergo the tyranny of her"
2913,XXV.,"brothers, and the cruel preferences accorded by parents to their male"
2914,XXV.,"children. Woman was the slave of her husband, and still more of social"
2915,XXV.,prejudices.... Let them not forget the physical disadvantage under which
2916,XXV.,she had to labour. She might justly call herself the pariah of the human
2917,XXV.,family.”
2918,XXV.,
2919,XXV.,"The word is apt and corroborative, for it was no honest act—it was not"
2920,XXV.,"Nature, but human cruelty and injustice that formed a pariah."

2922,XXV.,
2923,XXV.,8.—“... _opprobrious theme_.”
2924,XXV.,
2925,XXV.,_Conf._ ancient and mediæval superstitions and accusations on the
2926,XXV.,"subject. Raciborski notes these aspersions (Traité, p. 13):—“Pline"
2927,XXV.,prétendait que les femmes étant au moment des règles pouvaient dessécher
2928,XXV.,"les arbres par de simples attouchements, faire périr des fruits, &c.,"
2929,XXV.,&c.” And a further writer says more fully:—“Pliny informs us that the
2930,XXV.,"presence of a menstrual woman turns wine sour, causes trees to shed"
2931,XXV.,"their fruit, parches up their young fruit, and makes them for ever"
2932,XXV.,"barren, dims the splendour of mirrors and the polish of ivory, turns the"
2933,XXV.,"edge of sharpened iron, converts brass into rust, and is the cause of"
2934,XXV.,"canine rabies. In Isaiah xxx. 22, the writer speaks of the defilement of"
2935,XXV.,"graven images, which shall be cast away as a menstruous cloth; and in"
2936,XXV.,"Ezekiel xviii. 6, and xxxvi. 17, allusions of the same import are made.”"
2937,XXV.,"Unless we accept the antiquated notion of a “special curse” on women,"
2938,XXV.,how reconcile the idea of an “ordinance of Nature” being so repulsively
2939,XXV.,and opprobriously alluded to? Well may it be said:—“Ingratitude is a
2940,XXV.,"hateful vice. Not only the defects, but even the illnesses which have"
2941,XXV.,"their source in the excessive” (man-caused) “susceptibility of woman,"
2942,XXV.,are often made by men an endless subject of false accusations and
2943,XXV.,"pitiless reproaches.”—(M. le Docteur Cerise, in his Introduction to"

3048,XXVI.,“The Right to be Well Born”: “What higher motive can a man have in life
3049,XXVI.,"than to labour steadily to prepare the way for the coming of a higher,"
3050,XXVI.,"better humanity?... Dense ignorance prevails in our profession, and is"
3051,XXVI.,reflected by laymen. All their scientific studies and years of medical

3268,XXIX.,twenty years ago the professional prejudice was so deep and so widely
3269,XXIX.,"spread that it constituted a very formidable obstacle, but it has been"
3270,XXIX.,"steadily melting away before the logic of facts; and now is, with a"
3271,XXIX.,"few exceptions, rarely to be found among the leaders of the"
3272,XXIX.,"profession, nor indeed among the great majority of the rank and file,"
3273,XXIX.,as far as can be judged by the personal experience of medical women
3274,XXIX.,"themselves. Unfortunately, it seems strongest just where it has least"
3275,XXIX.,"justification, viz., among the practitioners who devote themselves"
3276,XXIX.,"chiefly to midwifery, and to the special diseases of women. The"
3277,XXIX.,"Obstetrical Society is, so far as I know, still of the same mind as"
3278,XXIX.,"when, in 1874, they excluded Dr. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, a"
3279,XXIX.,"distinguished M.D. of Paris, from their membership; and the Soho"
3280,XXIX.,Square Hospital for Women has never revoked its curt refusal to allow
3281,XXIX.,"me to enter its doors, when, in 1878, I proposed to take advantage of"
3282,XXIX.,the invitation issued in its report to all practitioners who were
3283,XXIX.,specially interested in the cases for which the hospital is reserved.
3284,XXIX.,"Sometimes this jealousy takes a sufficiently comic form. For instance,"
3285,XXIX.,I received for two successive years a lithographed circular inviting
3286,XXIX.,me by name to send to the _Lancet_ the reports of interesting cases
3287,XXIX.,"that might occur in my dispensary practice, but when I wrote in"
3288,XXIX.,"response to this supposed offer of professional fellowship, I received"
3289,XXIX.,by next post a hurried assurance from the editor that it was all a
3290,XXIX.,"mistake, and that, in fact, the _Lancet_ could not stoop to record"
3291,XXIX.,"medical experiences, however interesting, if they occurred in the"
3292,XXIX.,practice of the inferior sex! Probably it will not require many more

3403,XXX.,varies under the influence of causes which for the most part have been

3525,XXXIII.,"development of its complete capability of performance, exercise and"
3526,XXXIII.,persistent effort. That this is and has been the case for thousands of
3527,XXXIII.,"years in a far less degree in woman than in man, in consequence of her"
3528,XXXIII.,"defective training and education, will be denied by no one.” So says the"

3530,XXXIII.,
3531,XXXIII.,And Bebel also declares:—“The brain must be regularly used and
3532,XXXIII.,"correspondingly nourished, like any other organ, if its faculties are to"
3533,XXXIII.,"be fully developed.”—(“Woman,” Walther’s translation, p. 124.)"
3534,XXXIII.,
3535,XXXIII.,"Dr. Emanuel Bonavia, in the course of an able reply to a somewhat"
3536,XXXIII.,"shallow recent disquisition by Sir James Crichton Browne, says:—"
3537,XXXIII.,
3538,XXXIII.,"“From various sources we have learnt that the brain tissue, like every"
3539,XXXIII.,"other tissue, will _grow_ by exercise, and diminish, or degenerate and"
3540,XXXIII.,"atrophy by disuse. Keep your right arm tied up in a sling for a month,"
3541,XXXIII.,and you will then be convinced how much it has lost by disuse. Then
3542,XXXIII.,anatomists might perhaps be able to say—Lo! and behold! the muscles of
3543,XXXIII.,your right arm have a less specific gravity than those of your left arm;
3544,XXXIII.,"that the nerves and blood-vessels going to those muscles are smaller,"
3545,XXXIII.,"and that, _therefore_, the right arm cannot be the equal of the left,"
3546,XXXIII.,and must have a different function!
3547,XXXIII.,
3548,XXXIII.,"“Any medical student knows that if you tie the main trunk of an artery,"
3549,XXXIII.,a branch of it will in due course acquire the _calibre_ of the main
3550,XXXIII.,"trunk. If, for some reason, it cannot do so, the tissues, which the main"
3551,XXXIII.,"trunk originally supplied, _must_ suffer, and be weakened, from want of"
3552,XXXIII.,"a sufficient supply of blood.... Man, and especially British man, has"
3553,XXXIII.,evolved into what he is by endless trouble and struggle through past
3554,XXXIII.,ages. He has had to develop his present brain from very small
3555,XXXIII.,"beginnings. It would, therefore, now be the height of folly to allow the"
3556,XXXIII.,"thinking lobes of the mothers of the race to revert, intellectually, by"
3557,XXXIII.,"disuse step by step again to that of the lower animals, from which we"
3558,XXXIII.,"all come. That of course many may not believe, but it may be asked, how"
3559,XXXIII.,"can he or she believe these things with such weakened lobes, as he or"
3560,XXXIII.,she may have inherited from his or her mother? How indeed! If there is
3561,XXXIII.,"anything in nature that is true, it is this—That if you don’t use your"
3562,XXXIII.,limbs they will atrophy; if you don’t use your eyes they will atrophy;
3563,XXXIII.,if you don’t use your brain it will atrophy. They all follow the same
3564,XXXIII.,inexorable law. Use increases and sharpens; disuse decreases and dulls.
3565,XXXIII.,Diminished size of the frontal lobes and of the arteries that feed them
3566,XXXIII.,"mean nothing if they do not mean that woman’s main thinking organ, that"
3567,XXXIII.,"of the intellect, is, as Sir James would hint, degenerating by _disuse_"
3568,XXXIII.,"and neglect.”—(“Woman’s Frontal Lobes,” _Provincial Medical Journal_,"
3569,XXXIII.,"July, 1892.)"
3570,XXXIII.,
3571,XXXIII.,These facts suggest strongly that the waste at present induced in the
3572,XXXIII.,female body by the menstrual habit might well be absorbed in increase of
3573,XXXIII.,"brain power; and indeed, that this evolved habit has hitherto"
3574,XXXIII.,persistently sequestrated and carried off from woman’s organism the
3575,XXXIII.,blood force that should have gone to form brain power. This explanation
3576,XXXIII.,"would dispose of the awkwardly imagined “plethora” theory, as well as"
3577,XXXIII.,"one or two others, of sundry gynæcologists."
3578,XXXIII.,
3579,XXXIII.,And the converse—that the increased appropriation of the blood in
3580,XXXIII.,"forming brain power induces a state of bodily well-being, free from the"
3581,XXXIII.,"present waste and weariness,—would certainly seem to be borne out by"
3582,XXXIII.,"such evidence as that of the Hon. John W. Mitchell, the president of the"
3583,XXXIII.,"Southern California College of Law, who said in a recent lecture:—"
3584,XXXIII.,
3585,XXXIII.,"“Not only in this, but in other countries, there are successful women"
3586,XXXIII.,"practitioners (of Law), and in France, where the preparatory course is"
3587,XXXIII.,"most arduous, and the term of study longest, a woman recently took the"
3588,XXXIII.,"highest rank over 500 men in her graduating examinations, and during the"
3589,XXXIII.,whole six years of class study she only lost one day from her work.”
3590,XXXIII.,"(See Note LVII., 1.)"
3591,XXXIII.,
3592,XXXIII.,A few words may here be said as to the dubitable question of the
3593,XXXIII.,"relative size of the brain in man and woman, though the matter may not"
3594,XXXIII.,"be of great import, from more than one reason. For, as Bebel observes:"
3595,XXXIII.,“Altogether the investigations on the subject are too recent and too few
3596,XXXIII.,in number to allow of any definite conclusions” (p. 123). A. Dumas fils
3597,XXXIII.,"says (“Les Femmes qui Tuent,” p. 196)—“Les philosophes vous démontreront"
3598,XXXIII.,"que, si la force musculaire de l’homme est plus grande que celle de la"
3599,XXXIII.,"femme, la force nerveuse de la femme est plus grande que celle de"
3600,XXXIII.,"l’homme; que, si l’intelligence tient, comme on l’affirme aujourd’hui,"
3601,XXXIII.,"au développement et au poids de la matière cérébrale, l’intelligence de"
3602,XXXIII.,"la femme pourrait être déclarée supérieure à celle de l’homme, le plus"
3603,XXXIII.,"grand cerveau et le plus lourd comme poids, étant un cerveau de femme"
3604,XXXIII.,"lequel pesait 2,200 grammes, c’est a dire 400 grammes de plus que celui"
3605,XXXIII.,"de Cuvier. On ne dit pas, il est vrai, que cette femme ait écrit"
3606,XXXIII.,l’équivalent du livre de Cuvier sur les fossiles.”
3607,XXXIII.,
3608,XXXIII.,"To which last remark may be replied, again in the words of"
3609,XXXIII.,"Bebel,—“Darwin is perfectly right in saying that a list of the most"
3610,XXXIII.,"distinguished women in poetry, painting, sculpture, music, science, and"
3611,XXXIII.,"philosophy, will bear no comparison with a similar list of the most"
3612,XXXIII.,distinguished men. But surely this need not surprise us. It would be
3613,XXXIII.,surprising if it were not so. Dr. Dodel-Port (in “Die neuere
3614,XXXIII.,"Schöpfungsgeschichte”) answers to the point, when he maintains that the"
3615,XXXIII.,relative achievements would be very different after men and women had
3616,XXXIII.,received the same education and the same training in art and science
3617,XXXIII.,"during a certain number of generations.”—(“Woman,” p. 125.)"
3618,XXXIII.,
3619,XXXIII.,"“It is of small value to say—yes, but look how _many_ men excel and how"
3620,XXXIII.,"few women do so. True, but see how much repression men have exercised to"
3621,XXXIII.,"_prevent_ women from even equalling them, and how much shallowness of"
3622,XXXIII.,"mind they have encouraged. All manner of obstructions, coupled with"
3623,XXXIII.,"ridicule, have been put in their way, and until women succeed in"
3624,XXXIII.,"emancipating themselves, most men will probably continue to do so,"
3625,XXXIII.,simply because they have the power to do it. When women become
3626,XXXIII.,"emancipated, that is, are placed on social equality with men, this"
3627,XXXIII.,"senseless, mischievous opposition will die a natural death.”—E. Bonavia,"
3628,XXXIII.,M.D. (“Woman’s Frontal Lobes”).
3629,XXXIII.,
3630,XXXIII.,"To revert to the question of brain weight, one of the first of English"
3631,XXXIII.,specialists says:—
3632,XXXIII.,
3633,XXXIII.,"“Data might, therefore, be considered to show, in the strongest manner,"
3634,XXXIII.,how comparatively unimportant is mere bulk or weight of brain in
3635,XXXIII.,"reference to the degree of intelligence of its owner, when considered as"
3636,XXXIII.,"it often is, apart from the much more important question of the relative"
3637,XXXIII.,"amount of its grey matter, as well as of the amount and perfection of"
3638,XXXIII.,the minute internal development of the organ either actual or
3639,XXXIII.,"possible.”—Dr. H. C. Bastian (“The Brain as an Organ of Mind,” p. 375.)"
3640,XXXIII.,
3641,XXXIII.,The American physiologist Helen H. Gardener states:—“The differences (in
3642,XXXIII.,"brain) between individuals of the same sex—in adults at least, are known"
3643,XXXIII.,to be much more marked than any that are known to exist between the
3644,XXXIII.,sexes. Take the brains of the two poets Byron and Dante. Byron’s weighed
3645,XXXIII.,"1,807 grammes, while Dante’s weighed only 1,320 grammes, a difference of"
3646,XXXIII.,"487 grammes. Or take two statesmen, Cromwell and Gambetta. Cromwell’s"
3647,XXXIII.,"brain weighed 2,210 grammes, which, by the way, is the greatest healthy"
3648,XXXIII.,"brain on record; although Cuvier’s is usually quoted as the largest, a"
3649,XXXIII.,"part of the weight of his was due to disease, and if a diseased or"
3650,XXXIII.,"abnormal brain is to be taken as the standard, then the greatest on"
3651,XXXIII.,record is that of a negro criminal idiot; while Gambetta’s was only
3652,XXXIII.,"1,241 grammes, a difference of 969 grammes. Surely it will not be held"
3653,XXXIII.,because of this that Gambetta and Dante should have been denied the
3654,XXXIII.,educational and other advantages which were the natural right of Byron
3655,XXXIII.,"and Cromwell. Yet it is upon this very ground, by this very system of"
3656,XXXIII.,"reasoning, that it is proposed to deny women equal advantages and"
3657,XXXIII.,"opportunities, although the difference in brain weight between man and"
3658,XXXIII.,"woman is said to be only 100 grammes, and even this does not allow for"
3659,XXXIII.,"difference in body weight, and is based upon a system of averages, which"
3660,XXXIII.,is neither complete nor accurate.”—(Report of the International Council
3661,XXXIII.,"of Women, Washington, 1888, p. 378.)"
3662,XXXIII.,
3663,XXXIII.,Concerning an assertion that “the specific gravity of both the white and
3664,XXXIII.,"grey matter of the brain is greater in man than in woman,” Helen H."
3665,XXXIII.,Gardener says:—“Of this point this is what the leading brain anatomist
3666,XXXIII.,in America (Dr. E. C. Spitzka) wrote: ‘The only article recognised by
3667,XXXIII.,"the profession as important and of recent date, which takes this theory"
3668,XXXIII.,"as a working basis, is by Morselli, and he is compelled to make the"
3669,XXXIII.,"sinister admission, while asserting that the specific gravity is less in"
3670,XXXIII.,"the female, that with old age and with insanity the specific gravity"
3671,XXXIII.,increases.’ If this is the case I do not know that women need sigh over
3672,XXXIII.,their shortcoming in the item of specific gravity. There appear to be
3673,XXXIII.,two very simple methods open to them by which they may emulate their
3674,XXXIII.,"brothers in the matter of specific gravity, if they so desire. One of"
3675,XXXIII.,"these is certain, if they live long enough; and the other—well, there is"
3676,XXXIII.,"no protective tariff on insanity.”—(_Loc. cit._, p. 379.)"
3677,XXXIII.,
3678,XXXIII.,Helen Gardener further appositely observes:—“The brain of no remarkable
3679,XXXIII.,woman has ever been examined. Woman is ticketed to fit the hospital
3680,XXXIII.,"subjects and tramps, the unfortunates whose brains fall into the hands"
3681,XXXIII.,"of the profession as it were by mere accident, while man is represented"
3682,XXXIII.,"by the brains of the Cromwells, Cuviers, Byrons, and Spurzheims. By this"
3683,XXXIII.,method the average of men’s brains is carried to its highest level in
3684,XXXIII.,the matter of weight and texture; while that of women is kept at its
3685,XXXIII.,"lowest, and even then there is only claimed 100 grammes’"
3686,XXXIII.,"difference!”—(_Loc. cit._, p. 380.)"
3687,XXXIII.,
3688,XXXIII.,And she concludes her exhaustive paper with the closing paragraph of a
3689,XXXIII.,"letter to herself from Dr. E. C. Spitzka, the celebrated New York brain"
3690,XXXIII.,specialist:—“You may hold me responsible for the following declaration:
3691,XXXIII.,That any statement to the effect that an observer can tell by looking at
3692,XXXIII.,"a brain, or examining it microscopically, whether it belonged to a"
3693,XXXIII.,"female or a male subject, is not founded on carefully-observed facts...."
3694,XXXIII.,"No such difference has ever been demonstrated, nor do I think it will be"
3695,XXXIII.,by more elaborate methods than we now possess. Numerous female brains
3696,XXXIII.,"exceed numerous male brains in absolute weight, in complexity of"
3697,XXXIII.,"convolutions, and in what brain anatomists would call the nobler"
3698,XXXIII.,proportions. So that he who takes these as his criteria of the male
3699,XXXIII.,brain may be grievously mistaken in attempting to assert the sex of a
3700,XXXIII.,brain dogmatically. If I had one hundred female brains and one hundred
3701,XXXIII.,"male brains together, I should select the one hundred containing the"
3702,XXXIII.,largest and best-developed brains as probably containing fewer female
3703,XXXIII.,brains than the remaining one hundred. More than this no cautious
3704,XXXIII.,"experienced brain anatomist would venture to declare.”—(_Loc. cit._, p."
3705,XXXIII.,381.)
3706,XXXIII.,
3707,XXXIII.,Charles Darwin has clearly summarised this question of comparison of
3708,XXXIII.,"brain:—“No one, I presume, doubts that the large size of the brain in"
3709,XXXIII.,"man, relatively to his body, in comparison with that of the gorilla or"
3710,XXXIII.,"orang, is closely connected with his higher mental powers.... On the"
3711,XXXIII.,"other hand, no one supposes that the intellect of any two animals or of"
3712,XXXIII.,any two men can be accurately gauged by the cubic contents of their
3713,XXXIII.,skulls. It is certain that there may be extraordinary mental activity
3714,XXXIII.,with an extremely small absolute mass of nervous matter; thus the
3715,XXXIII.,"wonderfully diversified instincts, mental powers, and affections of ants"
3716,XXXIII.,"are generally known, yet their cerebral ganglia are not so large as the"
3717,XXXIII.,quarter of a small pin’s head. Under this latter point of view the brain
3718,XXXIII.,"of an ant is one of the most marvellous atoms of matter in the world,"
3719,XXXIII.,"perhaps more marvellous than the brain of man.”—(“The Descent of Man,”"

3770,XXXIII.,"As already shown, the subjugation of woman has not been an incident of"
3771,XXXIII.,Western “civilisation” alone. Mrs. Eliza W. Farnham relates that “When a
3772,XXXIII.,Chinese Mandarin in California was told that the women of America were
3773,XXXIII.,"nearly all taught to read and write, and that a majority of them were"
3774,XXXIII.,"able to keep books for their husbands, if they chose to do so, he shook"
3775,XXXIII.,"his head thoughtfully, and, with a foreboding sigh, replied, ‘If he"
3776,XXXIII.,"readee, writee, by’n-by he lickee all the men.’ Was that a barbarian"
3777,XXXIII.,"sentiment, or rather, perhaps, a presentiment of the higher sovereignty"
3778,XXXIII.,"coming?”—(“Woman and Her Era,” Vol. II., p. 41.)"

3785,XXXIV.,
3786,XXXIV.,“Villeins were not protected by Magna Charta. “_Nullus liber homo
3787,XXXIV.,"capiatur vel imprisonetur_,” &c., was cautiously expressed to exclude"
3788,XXXIV.,"the poor villein, for, as Lord Coke tells us, the lord may beat his"
3789,XXXIV.,"villein, and, if it be without cause, he cannot have any remedy. What a"
3790,XXXIV.,degraded condition for a being endued with reason!”—Edward Christian
3791,XXXIV.,"(“Note to Blackstone’s Commentaries,” Book II., Chap. VI.)"
3792,XXXIV.,
3793,XXXIV.,Mr. Christian’s exclamation of concern is doubtless meant to apply to
3794,XXXIV.,"the serf, yet was not the lord’s position equally despicable?"
3795,XXXIV.,
3796,XXXIV.,
3797,XXXIV.,6.—“... _in turn was master to a slave_.”
3798,XXXIV.,
3799,XXXIV.,"This was, in fact, simply extending the spirit of the feudal system"
3800,XXXIV.,"(with its serfdom as just pictured), a little further. Buckle"
3801,XXXIV.,exemplifies in ancient French society the servility descending from
3802,XXXIV.,one grade to another in man:—“By virtue of which each class exercising
3803,XXXIV.,"great power over the one below it, the subordination and subserviency"
3804,XXXIV.,"of the whole were completely maintained.... This, indeed, is but part"
3805,XXXIV.,of the old scheme to create distinctions for which Nature has given no
3806,XXXIV.,"warrant, to substitute a superiority which is conventional for that"
3807,XXXIV.,"which is real, and thus try to raise little minds above the level of"
3808,XXXIV.,"great ones. The utter failure, and, as society advances, the eventual"
3809,XXXIV.,"cessation of all such attempts is certain.” But, meanwhile, evil"
3810,XXXIV.,"accompaniments are apparent, as Buckle further instances by saying:"
3811,XXXIV.,"“Le Vassor, who wrote late in the reign of Louis XIV., bitterly says:"
3812,XXXIV.,"‘Les Français accoutumés à l’esclavage, ne sentent plus la pesanteur"
3813,XXXIV.,"de leurs chaînes.’”—(“History of Civilisation in England,” Vol. II,"
3814,XXXIV.,"Chaps III., IV.)"
3815,XXXIV.,
3816,XXXIV.,That the foregoing habits or foibles are human rather than simply
3817,XXXIV.,"masculine, or that the imitation of them very naturally spreads to the"
3818,XXXIV.,"other sex, would seem to be shown by such evidence as Letourneau gives:—"
3819,XXXIV.,
3820,XXXIV.,"“In primitive countries the married woman—that is to say, the woman"
3821,XXXIV.,"belonging to a man—has herself the conscience of being a thing, a"
3822,XXXIV.,"property (it is proved to her often and severely enough), but she does"
3823,XXXIV.,"not think of retaliating, especially in what concerns the conjugal"
3824,XXXIV.,"relations. Moreover, as her condition is oftenest that of a slave"
3825,XXXIV.,"overburdened with work, not only does she not resent the introduction of"
3826,XXXIV.,"other women in the house of the master, but she desires it, for the work"
3827,XXXIV.,will be so much the less for herself. Thus among the Zulus the wife
3828,XXXIV.,first purchased strives and works with ardour in the hope of furnishing
3829,XXXIV.,"her husband with means to acquire a second wife, a companion in misery"
3830,XXXIV.,"over whom, by right of seniority, she will have the upper hand.”—(“The"
3831,XXXIV.,"Evolution of Marriage,” Chap. VIII.)"
3832,XXXIV.,
3833,XXXIV.,"Yet, in point of fact, this is not woman seeking to establish her own"
3834,XXXIV.,"dominion, but rather to secure somewhat more of freedom for herself. As"
3835,XXXIV.,"Alexandre Dumas fils tells us, concerning the Mormon women:—"
3836,XXXIV.,
3837,XXXIV.,"“Non seulement elles donnent leur consentement à leurs maris, quand ils"
3838,XXXIV.,"le leur demandent pour un nouveau mariage, mais elles sont quelquefois"
3839,XXXIV.,"les premières à leur proposer une nouvelle femme qui a, disent-elles,"
3840,XXXIV.,"des qualités nécessaires à la communauté, en réalité pour augmenter un"
3841,XXXIV.,"peu la possession d’elles-mêmes, c’est-à-dire leur liberté.”—(“Les"

3846,XXXIV.,
3847,XXXIV.,The Laureate Rowe makes his heroine bitterly but with reason exclaim:—
3848,XXXIV.,
3849,XXXIV.,"“How hard is the condition of our sex,"
3850,XXXIV.,Through every state of life the slaves of man!
3851,XXXIV.,"In all the dear delightful days of youth,"
3852,XXXIV.,"A rigid father dictates to our wills,"
3853,XXXIV.,And deals out pleasure with a scanty hand:
3854,XXXIV.,"To his, the tyrant husband’s reign succeeds;"
3855,XXXIV.,"Proud with opinions of superior reason,"
3856,XXXIV.,He holds domestic business and devotion
3857,XXXIV.,"All we are capable to know, and shuts us,"
3858,XXXIV.,"Like cloistered idiots, from the world’s acquaintance"
3859,XXXIV.,And all the joys of freedom. Wherefore are we
3860,XXXIV.,"Born with high souls, but to assert ourselves,"
3861,XXXIV.,"Shake off this vile obedience they exact,"
3862,XXXIV.,And claim an equal empire o’er the world?”
3863,XXXIV.,"—(“The Fair Penitent,” Act III. sc. i.)"
3864,XXXIV.,
3865,XXXIV.,Letourneau shows the state of feminine tutelage carried still further:
3866,XXXIV.,"“We shall find that in many civilisations relatively advanced, widowhood"
3867,XXXIV.,even does not gratify the woman with a liberty of which she is never
3868,XXXIV.,"thought worthy.” And later on he quotes from the code of Manu, Book"
3869,XXXIV.,"V.:—“A little girl, a young woman, and an old woman ought never to do"
3870,XXXIV.,"anything of their own will, even in their own house.... During her"
3871,XXXIV.,childhood a woman depends on her father; during her youth on her
3872,XXXIV.,"husband; her husband being dead, on her sons; if she has no sons, on the"
3873,XXXIV.,"near relatives of her husband; or in default of them, on those of her"
3874,XXXIV.,"father; if she has no paternal relatives, on the Sovereign. A woman"

3906,XXXV.,
3907,XXXV.,"These dogmas which, under the guise of religion, were imposed on the"
3908,XXXV.,"acceptance of womanhood, may be aptly summarised and epitomised in the"
3909,XXXV.,following lines from one of the hierarchs of the system:—
3910,XXXV.,
3911,XXXV.,"“To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorn’d:"
3912,XXXV.,"‘My author and disposer, what thou bidd’st"
3913,XXXV.,Unargued I obey: so God ordains;
3914,XXXV.,"God is thy law, thou mine; to know no more"
3915,XXXV.,"Is woman’s happiest knowledge, and her praise.’”"
3916,XXXV.,"—(“Paradise Lost,” Book IV., 634.)"
3917,XXXV.,
3918,XXXV.,"Concerning which words of Milton well may Mary Wollstonecraft observe,"
3919,XXXV.,with a quiet sarcasm:—“If it be allowed that women were destined by
3920,XXXV.,"Providence to acquire human virtues, and, by the exercise of their"
3921,XXXV.,"understandings, that stability of character which is the firmest ground"
3922,XXXV.,"to rest our future hopes upon, they must be permitted to turn to the"
3923,XXXV.,"fountain of light, and not forced to shape their course by the twinkling"
3924,XXXV.,"of a satellite.”—(“Vindication of the Rights of Woman,” Chap. II.)"
3925,XXXV.,
3926,XXXV.,"Milton also discoursed learnedly, but self-interestedly, concerning"
3927,XXXV.,"divorce, claiming for the husband a privilege and option which he"
3928,XXXV.,utterly denied to the wife:—“... the power and arbitrement of divorce
3929,XXXV.,"from the master of the family, into whose hands God and the law of all"
3930,XXXV.,nations had put it ... that right which God from the beginning had
3931,XXXV.,entrusted to the husband.”—(“The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce.”)
3932,XXXV.,
3933,XXXV.,It was this same mediæval moralist who trained his daughters in the
3934,XXXV.,"pronunciation of various languages, that they might minister to his"
3935,XXXV.,comfort by reading to him in those tongues; while he carefully withheld
3936,XXXV.,from them any knowledge of the meaning of the words they were uttering.
3937,XXXV.,Could a greater insult or a more degrading office be inflicted on a
3938,XXXV.,cultured human intellect? Small wonder that his daughters were
3939,XXXV.,sufficiently “undutiful and unkind”—as Milton styled it—to leave him
3940,XXXV.,some years before his death. That the possessor of the same virile
3941,XXXV.,"intellect which penned the “Areopagitica,” with its brave freedom, could"
3942,XXXV.,tolerate and promulgate the servitude and degradation of one half of
3943,XXXV.,humanity indicates in him a mental darkness as gross and as pitiable as
3944,XXXV.,his physical blindness.

3951,XXXV.,"that the stronger animal, man, has kept the weaker in subjection,"
3952,XXXV.,allowing her to live only in so far as she ministered to his comforts;
3953,XXXV.,that he has not unnaturally made laws and fixed customs to suit his own
3954,XXXV.,"pleasure and convenience, always at the expense of the woman; and, what"
3955,XXXV.,"is worse, that he has in all countries given a religious sanction to his"
3956,XXXV.,"vices, in order to bend the woman to his wishes.... I might also add"
3957,XXXV.,that all cruel customs relating to woman have been imposed upon her
3958,XXXV.,"under the guise of religion, and hence, though so injurious and baneful"
3959,XXXV.,"to herself, she is even slower to change them than the man. There is"
3960,XXXV.,hardly any cruel wrong which has been inflicted in the course of ages by
3961,XXXV.,man upon his fellow-man that has not been justified by an appeal to
3962,XXXV.,"religion.”—Mrs. Pechey Phipson, M.D. (“Address to the Hindoos of"

3974,XXXV.,"that “Il y a des femmes honnêtes, esclaves du devoir, pieuses. Leur"
3975,XXXV.,religion leur a enseigné le sacrifice. Non seulement elles ne se
3976,XXXV.,plaignent pas des épreuves à traverser mais elles les appellent pour
3977,XXXV.,"mériter encore plus la récompense promise, et elles les bénissent quand"
3978,XXXV.,"elles viennent. Tout arrive, pour elles, par la volonté de Dieu, et tout"
3979,XXXV.,"est comme il doit être dans cette vallée des larmes, chemin de"
3980,XXXV.,"l’éternité bienheureuse.... D’ailleurs elles ne lisent ni les journaux,"
3981,XXXV.,ni les livres où il est question de ces choses-là; cette lecture leur
3982,XXXV.,"est interdite. Si, par hasard, elles avaient connaissance de pareilles"
3983,XXXV.,"idées, ... elles en rougiraient, elles en souffriraient pour leur sexe,"
3984,XXXV.,et elles prieraient pour celles qui se laissent aller à propager de si
3985,XXXV.,"dangereuses erreurs et à donner de si déplorables exemples.... Mais, pas"
3986,XXXV.,"plus que le bonheur, la ruse, l’ignorance, la misère et la servitude, la"
3987,XXXV.,"foi aveugle, l’extase, et l’immobilité volontaire de l’esprit ne sont"
3988,XXXV.,"des arguments sans réplique.”—(“Les Femmes qui Tuent,” &c., pp. 10, 91,"
3989,XXXV.,103.)
3990,XXXV.,
3991,XXXV.,"The evil which Dumas points out is common to all religions, of whatever"
3992,XXXV.,"race or make; the hall-mark of every creed, from Confucianism to"
3993,XXXV.,"Comtism, has been the subjection of woman, under the affectation of"
3994,XXXV.,advocating her highest interests. The pious compound has usually been
3995,XXXV.,altered to meet the growing intellectual requirements of common-sense
3996,XXXV.,"and justice and humanity, and hence the precepts of religion as to"
3997,XXXV.,feminine conduct have by no means always lain in such lines as the
3998,XXXV.,multitude in our modern Western civilisation still enjoins on women. No
3999,XXXV.,"more than the whole and universal attitude of religion, ancient or"
4000,XXXV.,"modern, as regards woman, is exposed or expressed in the following"
4001,XXXV.,recapitulation of present or historic facts:—“It is not the chastity of
4002,XXXV.,"women, as we understand it, but her subjection, that Japanese morality"
4003,XXXV.,"requires. The woman is a thing possessed, and her immorality consists"
4004,XXXV.,simply in disposing freely of herself.
4005,XXXV.,
4006,XXXV.,"“As regards prostitution, Brahmanic India is scarcely more scrupulous"
4007,XXXV.,"than Japan, and there again we find religious prostitution practised in"
4008,XXXV.,"the temples, analogous to that which in ancient Greece was practised at"
4009,XXXV.,"Cyprus, Corinth, Miletus, Tenedos, Lesbos, Abydos, &c. (Lecky, ‘History"
4010,XXXV.,"of European Morals,’ Vol. I., p. 103). According to the legend, the"
4011,XXXV.,"Buddha himself, Sakyamouni, when visiting the famous Indian town of"
4012,XXXV.,"Vasali, was received there by the great mistress of the courtesans."
4013,XXXV.,"(Mrs. Spier, ‘Life in Ancient India,’ p. 28).”—Letourneau (“The"
4014,XXXV.,"Evolution of Marriage,” Chap. X.)."
4015,XXXV.,
4016,XXXV.,"The enforcement, or commendation, or acceptance of the practice of"
4017,XXXV.,"prostitution, with its profanation of the dignity and individuality of"
4018,XXXV.,"woman, and its utter carelessness and disregard for either her physical"
4019,XXXV.,"or intellectual well-being, is indubitable evidence of the man-made"
4020,XXXV.,"(_i.e._, male) origin of such a scheme of religion or ethics or"
4021,XXXV.,"economics. For, as Mrs. Eliza W. Farnham truly remarks:—“If a doubt yet"
4022,XXXV.,remains on the mind of any reader that I have stated truly the part of
4023,XXXV.,"the masculine as cause in this terrible phenomenon, let it be considered"
4024,XXXV.,how man has always introduced prostitution in every country that he has
4025,XXXV.,"visited, and every island of the sea. Does anyone believe, for example,"
4026,XXXV.,that if the voyages of discovery and trade had been made by women
4027,XXXV.,"instead of men, to the islands of the Pacific, this scourge would have"
4028,XXXV.,"been left as the testimony of their visit, so that, in a few"
4029,XXXV.,"generations, the populations native there would have fallen a literal"
4030,XXXV.,"sacrifice to their sensuality, as they are actually falling to man’s at"
4031,XXXV.,"this day? There is no comment needed on the illustration, I am sure. The"
4032,XXXV.,common sense of every reader will furnish the best comment and answer
4033,XXXV.,"the question correctly.”—(“Woman and Her Era,” Vol. II., p. 299.)"
4034,XXXV.,
4035,XXXV.,"_Id._... Lastly, but most convincingly, as to the wilful and intentional"
4036,XXXV.,degradation and subjugation of woman by the teaching and rites of
4037,XXXV.,"religion, let it be noted that, among the Jews, the very fact of being a"
4038,XXXV.,"woman is made a disgrace; and woman, the mother of the human race, is"
4039,XXXV.,"insulted accordingly. In the morning synagogue service of prayer,"
4040,XXXV.,"directly after unitedly blessing “Adonai,” for bestowing on the"
4041,XXXV.,"barn-door fowl the power to distinguish between night and day, and for"
4042,XXXV.,"not having created the worshippers present heathens or slaves, each"
4043,XXXV.,member of the male portion of the congregation thanks the same Adonai
4044,XXXV.,"“that Thou hast not fashioned me as a woman,” while each member of the"
4045,XXXV.,segregated female portion of the company is instructed to submissively
4046,XXXV.,give thanks “that Thou hast fashioned me after Thine own pleasure.” The
4047,XXXV.,"male thanks for not being heathens seem, under the circumstances,"
4048,XXXV.,"conspicuously premature.—(See “Ohel Jakob,” _i.e._, “Jacob’s Temple,”"
4049,XXXV.,"the “Daily Prayer of the Israelites,” Fraenkel’s ed., Berlin.)"
4050,XXXV.,
4051,XXXV.,"That the spirit of this Mosaic or Hebrew sexual teaching, with its"
4052,XXXV.,"incongruous assertions and inferences, has communicated itself deeply to"
4053,XXXV.,"Christianity, may be observed from such passages as 1 Tim. ii. 13, 14; 1"
4054,XXXV.,"Cor. vii., 9; Eph. v. 24; Col. iii. 18; 1 Pet. iii. 1, 5; and many"
4055,XXXV.,others.
4056,XXXV.,
4057,XXXV.,"_Id._... Buckle quotes from “Fergusson on the Epistles,” 1656, p."
4058,XXXV.,"242:—“The great and main duty which a wife, as a wife, ought to learn,"
4059,XXXV.,"and so learn as to practice it, is to be subject to her own husband.”"
4060,XXXV.,"(See also Note XVII., 8.) And Buckle further cites, from “Fox’s"
4061,XXXV.,"Journal,” “After the middle of the seventeenth century the Quakers set"
4062,XXXV.,"up ‘women’s’ meetings, to the disgust of many, and (query, because) in"
4063,XXXV.,"the teeth of St. Paul’s opinion.”—(“Miscellaneous and Posthumous Works,”"
4064,XXXV.,"Vol. I., pp. 375, 384.)"
4065,XXXV.,
4066,XXXV.,"_Id._... As already said, the “sanctimonious” claim of “woman’s duty”"
4067,XXXV.,"runs through all religions. Here, for instance, is what is reported in a"
4068,XXXV.,"leader of the _Manchester Guardian_ of August 15th, 1892:—"
4069,XXXV.,
4070,XXXV.,“In this country no one would place suicide in the ranks of the
4071,XXXV.,"virtues. Here it is a crime, but in China under certain circumstances"
4072,XXXV.,it is regarded as an act of heroism and devotion worthy of sympathy
4073,XXXV.,and of national recognition. Thus the Governor of Shansi forwarded to
4074,XXXV.,the Emperor of China a memorial setting forth the virtues as daughter
4075,XXXV.,"and wife of a lady in that province. She was of good family, both her"
4076,XXXV.,father and grandfather having been officials in the district. At the
4077,XXXV.,age of ten she showed her love for her mother in a peculiarly Chinese
4078,XXXV.,fashion. One of the Celestial beliefs is that medicine acquires
4079,XXXV.,"efficacy by having mingled with it some human flesh, and the little"
4080,XXXV.,girl cut some from her own body to be used for the purpose of curing
4081,XXXV.,an illness which threatened her mother’s life. In 1890 she was married
4082,XXXV.,"to an ‘expectant magistrate,’ whose expectations were realised by his"
4083,XXXV.,"appointment last autumn to a judicial post. What she had, as a good"
4084,XXXV.,"daughter, done for her mother, she, as a good wife, did also for her"
4085,XXXV.,"husband, who fell ill; but her remedy was inefficacious, and he died."
4086,XXXV.,"She was now in a position which, according to the Chinese code of"
4087,XXXV.,"ethics, has no responsibilities for a woman. Without parents, husband,"
4088,XXXV.,"or children to demand her affectionate care, she decided to commit"
4089,XXXV.,"suicide, and apparently not only communicated her intentions to those"
4090,XXXV.,"around her, but had their sympathy and support in her decision. We are"
4091,XXXV.,"told that, “only waiting till she had completed the arrangements for"
4092,XXXV.,"her husband’s interment, she swallowed gold and powder of lead. She"
4093,XXXV.,handed her _trousseau_ to her relations to defray her funeral
4094,XXXV.,"expenses, and made presents to the younger members of the family and"
4095,XXXV.,"the servants, after which, draped in her state robes, she sat waiting"
4096,XXXV.,"her end. The poison began to work, and soon all was over.” The story"
4097,XXXV.,of a distracted wife seeking refuge in death from the sorrows of
4098,XXXV.,"widowhood might doubtless be told of any country in Europe, but the"
4099,XXXV.,"sequel is possible only in China. The Governor of Shansi, struck with"
4100,XXXV.,the courage of the lady in what he evidently regards as a very proper
4101,XXXV.,"though somewhat unusual exhibition of conjugal affection, asks in his"
4102,XXXV.,memorial that the virtuous life and death of the lady may be duly
4103,XXXV.,commemorated. The prayer of the memorial has been granted by the
4104,XXXV.,Emperor and a memorial arch is to be erected in honour of the
4105,XXXV.,suicide.”

4139,XXXVI.,
4140,XXXVI.,
4141,XXXVI.,6.—“... _civil law_ ...”
4142,XXXVI.,
4143,XXXVI.,For example of this let us look at the law of our own country in even
4144,XXXVI.,recent times. Blackstone says:—“The husband (by the old law) might give
4145,XXXVI.,his wife moderate correction.... But this power of correction was
4146,XXXVI.,"confined within reasonable bounds, and the husband was prohibited from"
4147,XXXVI.,"using any violence to his wife, _aliter quam ad virum ex causa regiminis"
4148,XXXVI.,"et castigationis uxoris suæ licite et rationabiliter pertinet_ (_i.e._,"
4149,XXXVI.,"otherwise than to a man for the ruling and punishment of his wife,"
4150,XXXVI.,lawfully and reasonably pertains). The civil law gave the husband the
4151,XXXVI.,"same or a larger authority over his wife, allowing him for some"
4152,XXXVI.,"misdemeanours, _flagellis et fustibus acriter verberare uxorem_ (_i.e._,"
4153,XXXVI.,"to severely beat his wife with whips and cudgels), for others, only"
4154,XXXVI.,_modicam castigationem adhibere_ (to administer a moderate
4155,XXXVI.,"chastisement). But with us, in the politer reign of Charles the Second,"
4156,XXXVI.,"this power of correction began to be doubted, and a wife may now"
4157,XXXVI.,"(_circ._ 1750) have security of peace against her husband; or in return,"
4158,XXXVI.,"a husband against his wife. Yet the lower rank of people, who were"
4159,XXXVI.,"always fond of the old common law,” (query, were the women fond of it?)"
4160,XXXVI.,“still claim and exert their ancient privilege: and the courts of law
4161,XXXVI.,will still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty in case of
4162,XXXVI.,"any gross misbehaviour.” (“Commentaries,” Edward Christian’s Ed., Book"
4163,XXXVI.,"I., Chap. XV.)"
4164,XXXVI.,
4165,XXXVI.,Such was undoubtedly the generally accepted and not infrequently acted
4166,XXXVI.,"upon assumption; and it is certain that the Courts of Law would, in the"
4167,XXXVI.,"event of a wife absenting herself from her husband, order her return to"
4168,XXXVI.,"his custody; and would, and did imprison her in default of her"
4169,XXXVI.,compliance. And this state of things continued until—as Mrs.
4170,XXXVI.,Wolstenholme Elmy records in her history of the celebrated “Clitheroe
4171,XXXVI.,case”—
4172,XXXVI.,
4173,XXXVI.,"“At length, in the year 1891, and, as in the case of the negro"
4174,XXXVI.,"Somerset, upon the return to a writ of _habeas corpus_, there have"
4175,XXXVI.,been found judges bold enough and just enough to set aside the ancient
4176,XXXVI.,"saws and maxims, resting mainly upon _obiter dicta_ and loose phrases"
4177,XXXVI.,of previous judges used in reference to hypothetical cases never
4178,XXXVI.,"actually before the Courts, and to declare plainly and straightly that"
4179,XXXVI.,the personal slavery of the wife is no part of the law of England. The
4180,XXXVI.,actual words of the Lord Chancellor in dealing with the return to the
4181,XXXVI.,"writ are, as reported by the _Times_, March 20th, 1891, as follows:—"
4182,XXXVI.,
4183,XXXVI.,"“After stating the circumstances of the marriage, the decree, and the"
4184,XXXVI.,"refusal of the wife to cohabit, it states: ‘I therefore took my wife,"
4185,XXXVI.,"and have since detained her in my house, using no more force or"
4186,XXXVI.,restraint than necessary to take her and keep her.’ That is the return
4187,XXXVI.,which seeks to justify an admitted imprisonment of this lady. I do not
4188,XXXVI.,know that I am able to express in sufficiently precise language the
4189,XXXVI.,"difference between ‘confinement’ and ‘imprisonment,’ but if there is"
4190,XXXVI.,"any distinction, I can only say that upon these facts I should find an"
4191,XXXVI.,"imprisonment, and looking at the return it is put as a broad"
4192,XXXVI.,"proposition that the right of the husband, where there has been a"
4193,XXXVI.,wilful absenting of herself by the wife from her husband’s house—that
4194,XXXVI.,"it is his right to seize possession of his wife by force, and detain"
4195,XXXVI.,her in his house until she renders him conjugal rights. That is the
4196,XXXVI.,"proposition of law involved in the return, and I am not prepared to"
4197,XXXVI.,assent to it. The Legislature has expressly deprived the Matrimonial
4198,XXXVI.,Court of the power of imprisoning the wife for refusal to comply with
4199,XXXVI.,"a decree for restitution of conjugal rights, and the result of such a"
4200,XXXVI.,"system of law, if the husband had the power, would be that whereas the"
4201,XXXVI.,"Court had no power to hand the wife over into her husband’s hands, but"
4202,XXXVI.,only to punish her for contempt by imprisonment under the control of
4203,XXXVI.,"the Court, and without any circumstances of injury or insult, and even"
4204,XXXVI.,"that power was taken away, the husband might himself of his own motion"
4205,XXXVI.,seize and imprison her until she consented to the restitution of
4206,XXXVI.,conjugal rights. That is the proposition I am called upon to establish
4207,XXXVI.,by holding this return to be good. _I am of opinion that no such right
4208,XXXVI.,or power exists in law. I am of opinion that no such right ever did
4209,XXXVI.,exist in our law._ Whatever authorities may be quoted for any such
4210,XXXVI.,"proposition, it has always been subject to this condition: that where"
4211,XXXVI.,"she has a complaint of, or is apprehensive of, ill-usage, the Court"
4212,XXXVI.,will never interfere to compel her to return to her husband’s custody.
4213,XXXVI.,Now this brings me to the particular circumstances of this
4214,XXXVI.,transaction. I am prepared to say that no English subject has a right
4215,XXXVI.,"to imprison another English subject (who is _sui juris_, and entitled"
4216,XXXVI.,"to a judgment of his or her own) without any lawful authority, but if"
4217,XXXVI.,there were any qualification of that proposition I should be of
4218,XXXVI.,opinion that on the facts of this case it would afford an ample
4219,XXXVI.,justification to any Court for refusing to allow the husband in this
4220,XXXVI.,case to retain the custody of his wife.
4221,XXXVI.,
4222,XXXVI.,“On these and other grounds the Lord Chancellor declared that the
4223,XXXVI.,"return of the writ was bad, and ordered that the lady be restored to"
4224,XXXVI.,"her liberty, the other judges concurring.”—(“The Decision in the"
4225,XXXVI.,"Clitheroe Case and its Consequences,” pp. 3, 4.)"
4226,XXXVI.,
4227,XXXVI.,"Lord Esher was one of the two other Judges, both concurring, who formed"
4228,XXXVI.,"the Court of Appeal which granted the writ, and a few days subsequently"
4229,XXXVI.,he gave from his place in the House of Lords the following further
4230,XXXVI.,statement of his judgment and views:—
4231,XXXVI.,
4232,XXXVI.,"“As I was a party to the judgment, which seems to have been more"
4233,XXXVI.,"misunderstood than any judgment I recollect, I, perhaps, may be"
4234,XXXVI.,excused from making an observation. It was urged before the Court of
4235,XXXVI.,Appeal that by the law of England a husband may beat his wife with a
4236,XXXVI.,"stick if she refuses to obey him, and that if a wife refused her"
4237,XXXVI.,"husband conjugal rights, whatever that phrase may mean, which I have"
4238,XXXVI.,"never been able to make out, he may imprison her until she restores"
4239,XXXVI.,"him conjugal rights, or satisfies him that she will. All that the"
4240,XXXVI.,Court of Appeal decided was that a husband cannot by the law of
4241,XXXVI.,"England, if the wife objects, lawfully do either of those things."
4242,XXXVI.,Those intelligent people who have declared that the judgment is wrong
4243,XXXVI.,"must be prepared to maintain the converse—namely, that if a wife"
4244,XXXVI.,disobeys her husband he may lawfully beat her; and if she refuses him
4245,XXXVI.,"a restitution of conjugal rights he may imprison her, it was urged, in"
4246,XXXVI.,"the cellar, or in the cupboard, or, if the house is large, in the"
4247,XXXVI.,"house, by locking her in it and blocking the windows. I thought, and"
4248,XXXVI.,"still think, that the law does not allow these things....”—(The"
4249,XXXVI.,"_Times_, 17th April, 1891.)"
4250,XXXVI.,
4251,XXXVI.,Mrs. Wolstenholme Elmy further tells us that:—
4252,XXXVI.,
4253,XXXVI.,“To Lord Selborne the married women of this country owe a further debt
4254,XXXVI.,of gratitude for his introduction in 1884 of the Matrimonial Causes
4255,XXXVI.,"Act of that session, which put an end to the punishment by"
4256,XXXVI.,imprisonment of the husband or wife who refused to obey the decree of
4257,XXXVI.,the Court for restitution of conjugal rights. The arguments of Mr.
4258,XXXVI.,"Lankester and Mr. Finlay in the Clitheroe case, based upon this"
4259,XXXVI.,"abolition of the power of the Court to imprison for disobedience, are"
4260,XXXVI.,known to everyone. It would be destructive not only to personal
4261,XXXVI.,"freedom, but a gross infraction of justice and common-sense, were a"
4262,XXXVI.,husband to be permitted to exercise on his own behalf and at his own
4263,XXXVI.,pleasure a prerogative of punishment which had been withdrawn from the
4264,XXXVI.,Court.
4265,XXXVI.,
4266,XXXVI.,"“That this power of imprisonment was not a mere _brutum fulmen_, but a"
4267,XXXVI.,"terrible reality in former days, may be learned from a Suffolk case,"
4268,XXXVI.,"early in the present century. A wife in contempt of court, a lady of"
4269,XXXVI.,"good family in Suffolk, was imprisoned in Ipswich goal for disobeying"
4270,XXXVI.,a decree requiring her to render conjugal rights to her husband. At
4271,XXXVI.,the end of a year and ten months she became in want of the common
4272,XXXVI.,"necessaries of life, and was reduced to the gaol allowance of bread"
4273,XXXVI.,"and water; she suffered from rheumatism and other maladies, which were"
4274,XXXVI.,aggravated by the miseries of her imprisonment; and after many years
4275,XXXVI.,of such suffering died in prison—for she never went back to her
4276,XXXVI.,"husband.”—(“The Decision in the Clitheroe Case and its Consequences,”"
4277,XXXVI.,p. 9.)
4278,XXXVI.,
4279,XXXVI.,"But while the law has thus been needfully amended in England, a further"
4280,XXXVI.,evil effect has meantime supervened in our dependency of India; for this
4281,XXXVI.,faculty of imprisonment by the Courts for non-compliance with their
4282,XXXVI.,"order in the event specified, which has been abolished in England, seems"
4283,XXXVI.,to be still existent and appealed to in our Indian Courts. (See Note
4284,XXXVI.,"XXII., 2.) The strange thing is that the suit for the restitution of"
4285,XXXVI.,"conjugal rights is not a matter of native law, but an inadvertent and"
4286,XXXVI.,apparently entirely unintentional introduction from our English system;
4287,XXXVI.,the very judges who administer the Indian Law being at a loss to account
4288,XXXVI.,"for its appearance in their practice. One authority, in seeking the"
4289,XXXVI.,"solution of the problem, declares that—“Mr. —— ‘could not find any"
4290,XXXVI.,enactment directly establishing suits for the restitution of conjugal
4291,XXXVI.,"rights, and believed there were none; but that they had been recognised"
4292,XXXVI.,"in a Stamp Act, and again in the Limitation of Suits Act passed in"
4293,XXXVI.,1871.’ The material point is that Indian lawgivers have not consciously
4294,XXXVI.,given this remedy to those who did not possess it before; but that it
4295,XXXVI.,has slipped into our law without design. Mr. —— thinks ‘That this class
4296,XXXVI.,"of suits was known in the old Supreme Courts, in the Presidency towns,"
4297,XXXVI.,and as between Europeans; and it was not an improper subject of
4298,XXXVI.,legislation as regards Stamp Duty or Limitation by Time: but being
4299,XXXVI.,spoken of without qualification was held by the High Courts to be
4300,XXXVI.,available for all classes of the Indian communities.’ If this theory be
4301,XXXVI.,"true, it accounts in an easy way for a change effected without any"
4302,XXXVI.,intention of the Rulers at all. It is worth enquiry into under this
4303,XXXVI.,"aspect.” Yes, enquiry and rectification hand in hand!"
4304,XXXVI.,
4305,XXXVI.,_Id._—“... _and part divine_.”
4306,XXXVI.,
4307,XXXVI.,"The fact has been that male lawgivers, in whatever land, have generally"
4308,XXXVI.,"asserted for their code of feminine ethics or conduct a divine origin,"
4309,XXXVI.,and have announced the punishment for breach thereof as a divine
4310,XXXVI.,"injunction. In very few instances, indeed, was there any attempt to"
4311,XXXVI.,decree an equal punishment to the male who was partner with the female
4312,XXXVI.,"in a mutual breach of this morality, and very frequently no punishment"
4313,XXXVI.,of the male attached at all; and even in the few cases where such a
4314,XXXVI.,"punishment was nominally threatened, the man’s share in the offence was"
4315,XXXVI.,"most generally connived at, and passed unpunished. This double code of"
4316,XXXVI.,"morality has a flagrant exemplification in the English Law of Divorce,"
4317,XXXVI.,"by which, while a man can procure a Decree of Divorce on the simple"
4318,XXXVI.,"ground of the adultery of his wife, a woman cannot obtain a like decree"
4319,XXXVI.,for her husband’s adultery unless that offence be accompanied by such
4320,XXXVI.,"treatment of herself as the Court will recognise as “cruelty,” or with"
4321,XXXVI.,"“desertion.” The double scheme of sexual morality, so revoltingly"
4322,XXXVI.,"tolerated, in so far as man is concerned, by “society” in the present"
4323,XXXVI.,day is too patent to need further words here. And the repulsive cant is
4324,XXXVI.,"still that, while the man is allowed to go free, the punishment of the"
4325,XXXVI.,woman is due and commendable as in accordance with “divine law.” (See
4326,XXXVI.,"Note XIV., 3.)"

4336,XXXVII.,"‘baron’ and ‘feme.’”—(Blackstone’s “Commentaries,” Bk. I. Chap. 15.)"
4337,XXXVII.,
4338,XXXVII.,But the context of the words “baron” and “feme” involved something more
4339,XXXVII.,"than a mere _façon de parler_ of the law books. Edward Christian says,"
4340,XXXVII.,in Note 23 to the Chapter in “Blackstone” above quoted:—“Husband and
4341,XXXVII.,"wife, in the language of the law, are styled _baron_ and _feme_; the"
4342,XXXVII.,"word baron, or lord, attributes to the husband not a very courteous"
4343,XXXVII.,superiority. But we might be inclined to think this merely an unmeaning
4344,XXXVII.,"technical phrase, if we did not recollect, that if the baron kills his"
4345,XXXVII.,feme it is the same as if he had killed a stranger or any other person;
4346,XXXVII.,but if the feme kills her baron it is regarded by the laws as a much
4347,XXXVII.,"more atrocious crime, as she not only breaks through the restraints of"
4348,XXXVII.,"humanity and conjugal affection, but throws off all subjection to the"
4349,XXXVII.,"authority of her husband. And, therefore, the law denominates her crime"
4350,XXXVII.,"a species of treason, and condemns her to the same punishment as if she"
4351,XXXVII.,had killed the king. And for every species of treason (though in petit
4352,XXXVII.,"treason the punishment of men was only to be drawn and hanged), till the"
4353,XXXVII.,"30 Geo. III., Chap. 48, the sentence of woman was to be drawn and burnt"
4354,XXXVII.,alive.”
4355,XXXVII.,
4356,XXXVII.,"And Mr. Courtney Kenny says, on the same point, that the English Law of"
4357,XXXVII.,Marriage in the twelfth century had “clothed the humblest husband with
4358,XXXVII.,"more than the authority of a feudal lord, and merged his wife’s legal"
4359,XXXVII.,existence altogether in his own.”—(“History of the Law of Married
4360,XXXVII.,"Women’s Property,” p. 8.)"
4361,XXXVII.,
4362,XXXVII.,And he exemplifies the position of the “feme” as being accurately
4363,XXXVII.,depicted in the words of Petruchio:—
4364,XXXVII.,
4365,XXXVII.,"“I will be master of what is mine own,"
4366,XXXVII.,"She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,"
4367,XXXVII.,"My household stuff, my field, my barn,"
4368,XXXVII.,"My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything.”"
4369,XXXVII.,"—(“The Taming of the Shrew,” Act III., scene 2.)"
4370,XXXVII.,
4371,XXXVII.,The picture of the past masculine proprietorship and “bullyism” is
4372,XXXVII.,scarcely overdrawn. Ere a distant day Englishmen will shudder in
4373,XXXVII.,reflecting on the male creatures who were their progenitors.

4377,XXXVII.,"In his own governance, denies it her._”"
4378,XXXVII.,
4379,XXXVII.,"By a leading article on Woman Suffrage, in the _Times_ of 29th April,"
4380,XXXVII.,"1892, a clear light is thrown on the causes which largely influenced the"
4381,XXXVII.,extension of the Parliamentary franchise to the poorer class of male
4382,XXXVII.,"citizens,—“a share of political power which they are not particularly"
4383,XXXVII.,"well fitted to use,” says the _Times_;—and which denied the same right"
4384,XXXVII.,of franchise to women of whatever class. The intellect of the _Times_
4385,XXXVII.,enounces that—
4386,XXXVII.,
4387,XXXVII.,"“Without desiring to disparage the sex in any way, we must venture to"
4388,XXXVII.,maintain that in both camps a large female contingent would be a
4389,XXXVII.,mischievous element. The female Conservative politician would be an
4390,XXXVII.,obstacle to all rational reform; the female Liberal politician would
4391,XXXVII.,be the advocate of every crude and febrile innovation. No doubt we
4392,XXXVII.,have put plausible arguments in the mouths of mere logic-choppers by
4393,XXXVII.,treating the franchise as a right rather than as a privilege and a
4394,XXXVII.,trust. Men can demand a share of _political power which they are not
4395,XXXVII.,"particularly well fitted to use_, because they possess _de facto_ a"
4396,XXXVII.,share of the physical force upon which all political arrangements
4397,XXXVII.,"ultimately repose. Women do not possess such physical force, and,"
4398,XXXVII.,"therefore, can prefer no such claim.”"
4399,XXXVII.,
4400,XXXVII.,"Passing over, as unworthy of serious refutation, the wild assertions due"
4401,XXXVII.,"to sex-bias in the first part of the above extract, it may be noted how"
4402,XXXVII.,instantly the lauded masculine weapon of logic is discarded and
4403,XXXVII.,contemned as soon as it points in the direction of equal justice for
4404,XXXVII.,"woman. The “physical force” question is further dealt with in Note XLV.,"
4405,XXXVII.,"6. But considering the words we have italicised, does not the whole of"
4406,XXXVII.,the _Times_ exposition as above justify the appellation of cowardly
4407,XXXVII.,“fear”? (See also p. 78.)
4408,XXXVII.,
4409,XXXVII.,_Id._... Yet an even more unworthy thing than denial of the suffrage has
4410,XXXVII.,"taken place, in that English women have been really robbed of their"
4411,XXXVII.,earlier franchises. A lady Poor Law Guardian of the Tewkesbury Union has
4412,XXXVII.,written:—
4413,XXXVII.,
4414,XXXVII.,“... the present position of women in regard to the various franchises
4415,XXXVII.,"is anomalous and contradictory, unworthy of that great growth of"
4416,XXXVII.,"freedom which the nineteenth century has given to men, and degenerate"
4417,XXXVII.,as regards the position which women held in the days of the
4418,XXXVII.,Plantagenets and the Tudors. Freedom for women has not broadened down
4419,XXXVII.,‘from precedent to precedent.’ Rather has it suffered by unnecessary
4420,XXXVII.,"legislative interference. Every woman, except the Queen, is,"
4421,XXXVII.,"politically, non-existent. It was not always so. Restrictions unknown"
4422,XXXVII.,to our ancient constitution have crept in.... Chief Justice Lee is
4423,XXXVII.,reported to have cited a case (in a manuscript collection of
4424,XXXVII.,"Hakewell’s), Catherine _v._ Surrey, in which it was expressly decided,"
4425,XXXVII.,"that a _feme sole_, if she has a freehold, may vote for members of"
4426,XXXVII.,"Parliament; and a further one (from the same collection), Holt _v._"
4427,XXXVII.,"Lyle, in which it was decided, that a _feme sole_ householder may"
4428,XXXVII.,"claim a voice for Parliament men; but, if married, her husband must"
4429,XXXVII.,"vote for her; whilst Justice Page declared, ‘I see no disability in a"
4430,XXXVII.,"woman from voting for a Parliament man.’ So closely, in the minds of"
4431,XXXVII.,"our Judges, were the local and Parliamentary franchises bound up, that"
4432,XXXVII.,a question as to the rights of women in local voting seemed to involve
4433,XXXVII.,considerations as to their right to vote for Parliament men.
4434,XXXVII.,
4435,XXXVII.,"“Yet, even in the matter of these local franchises, women have"
4436,XXXVII.,"suffered, and do suffer, from legislative tinkering and sex-biassed"
4437,XXXVII.,decisions in our law courts.
4438,XXXVII.,
4439,XXXVII.,"“Down to 1835, women, possessing the qualifications which entitled men"
4440,XXXVII.,"to vote, voted freely in municipal elections, and in some important"
4441,XXXVII.,"cities, such as London and Edinburgh, the civic rights even of married"
4442,XXXVII.,"women, possessing a separate qualification from the husband, were well"
4443,XXXVII.,"established. The Municipal Corporations Act of 1835, however (passed"
4444,XXXVII.,"by the Whig administration of Lord Melbourne), was framed upon the"
4445,XXXVII.,"evil precedent of the Reform Act of 1832, and by the use of the words"
4446,XXXVII.,"‘male persons,’ in treating of the franchises under it, disfranchised"
4447,XXXVII.,"every woman in the boroughs to which it applied, and this"
4448,XXXVII.,disfranchisement lasted for thirty-four years.
4449,XXXVII.,
4450,XXXVII.,"“Nevertheless, in non-corporate districts, women continued to vote as"
4451,XXXVII.,"freely as before, and thus secured the ultimate restitution of the"

4840,XLV.,
4841,XLV.,"“We find a good example in the United States, where, to the horror of"
4842,XLV.,"learned and unlearned pedants of both sexes, numerous colleges exist in"
4843,XLV.,which large numbers of young men and women are educated together. And
4844,XLV.,"with what results? President White, of the University of Michigan,"
4845,XLV.,expresses himself thus: ‘For some years past a young woman has been the
4846,XLV.,"best scholar of the Greek language among 1,300 students; the best"
4847,XLV.,student in mathematics in one of the classes of our institution is a
4848,XLV.,"young woman, and many of the best scholars in natural and general"
4849,XLV.,"science are also young women.’ Dr. Fairchild, President of Oberlin"
4850,XLV.,"College in Ohio, in which over 1,000 students of both sexes study in"
4851,XLV.,"mixed classes, says: ‘During an experience of eight years as Professor"
4852,XLV.,"of the ancient languages, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and in the branches"
4853,XLV.,"of ethics and philosophy, and during an experience of eleven years in"
4854,XLV.,"theoretical and applied mathematics, the only difference which I have"
4855,XLV.,observed between the sexes was in the manner of their rhetoric.’ Edward
4856,XLV.,"H. Machill, President of Swarthmore College, in Pennsylvania, tells us"
4857,XLV.,that an experience of four years has forced him to the conclusion that
4858,XLV.,the education of both sexes in common leads to the best moral results.
4859,XLV.,This may be mentioned in passing as a reply to those who imagine such an
4860,XLV.,"education must endanger morality.”—Bebel (“Women,” Walther’s"
4861,XLV.,"Translation, p. 131). (See also Notes to line 7, forward.)"
4862,XLV.,
4863,XLV.,It is of good omen that the precedent thus set in America is finding a
4864,XLV.,following in our own isle also. All honour to the University of St.
4865,XLV.,"Andrews, concerning which sundry newspapers of 15th March, 1892, relate"
4866,XLV.,that: “The Senatus Academicus of the University of St. Andrews has
4867,XLV.,"agreed to open its classes in arts, science, and theology to women, who"
4868,XLV.,will be taught along with men. The University will receive next year a
4869,XLV.,"sum of over £30,000 to be spent on bursaries, one half of the sum to be"
4870,XLV.,devoted to women exclusively. Steps are being taken to secure a hall of
4871,XLV.,residence in which the women students may live while attending the
4872,XLV.,University classes.”

4896,XLV.,or less in the methods of all sciences; so that when turned into the
4897,XLV.,"world to make their own way, they shall be prepared to face scientific"
4898,XLV.,"problems, not by knowing at once the conditions of every problem, or by"
4899,XLV.,"being able at once to solve it, but by being familiar with the general"
4900,XLV.,"current of scientific thought, and by being able to apply the methods of"

4902,XLV.,conditions of the special problem.”—T. H. Huxley (“Essay on Scientific
4903,XLV.,Education”).
4904,XLV.,
4905,XLV.,"And the same learned professor tells us, on another occasion:—“A liberal"
4906,XLV.,education is an artificial education which has not only prepared a man
4907,XLV.,"to escape the great evils of disobedience to natural laws, but has"
4908,XLV.,trained him to appreciate and to seize upon the rewards which Nature
4909,XLV.,"scatters with as free a hand as her penalties. That man, I think,”"
4910,XLV.,"(shall we not include “woman” also, on his own showing as above?) “has"
4911,XLV.,had a liberal education who has been so trained in youth that his body
4912,XLV.,"is the ready servant of his will, and does with ease and pleasure all"
4913,XLV.,"the work that, as a mechanism, it is capable of; whose intellect is a"
4914,XLV.,"clear, cold logic engine, with all its parts in equal strength and in"
4915,XLV.,"smooth working order, ready, like a steam engine, to be turned to every"
4916,XLV.,"kind of work, and spin the gossamers as well as forge the anchors of the"
4917,XLV.,mind; whose mind is stored with a knowledge of the great and fundamental
4918,XLV.,"truths of Nature, and of the laws of her operations; one who, no stunted"
4919,XLV.,"ascetic, is full of life and fire, but whose passions are trained to"
4920,XLV.,"come to heel by a vigorous will, the servant of a tender conscience; who"
4921,XLV.,"has learned to love all beauty, whether of Nature or of art, to hate all"
4922,XLV.,"vileness, and to respect others as himself."
4923,XLV.,
4924,XLV.,"“Such an one, and no other, I conceive, has had a liberal education, for"
4925,XLV.,he is as completely as a man can be in harmony with Nature. He will make
4926,XLV.,"the best of her, and she of him. They will get on together rarely; she"
4927,XLV.,"as his ever beneficent mother, he as her mouthpiece, her conscious self,"

4931,XLV.,6.—“_In strength alike the sturdy comrades train_; ...”
4932,XLV.,
4933,XLV.,How largely strength is simply a matter of training may be instanced by
4934,XLV.,a case or two:—
4935,XLV.,
4936,XLV.,“The results of practice and training from childhood on the bodily
4937,XLV.,"development can be seen in female acrobats and circus riders, who could"
4938,XLV.,"compete with any man in courage, daring, dexterity, and strength, and"
4939,XLV.,"whose performances are frequently astonishing.”—Bebel (“Woman,” p. 126)."
4940,XLV.,
4941,XLV.,"“I am a medical man. I have spent several years in Africa, and have seen"
4942,XLV.,human nature among tribes whose habits are utterly unlike those of
4943,XLV.,Europe. I had been accustomed to believe that the _muscular_ system of
4944,XLV.,"women is necessarily feebler than that of men, and perhaps I might have"
4945,XLV.,"dogmatised to that effect; but, to my astonishment, I found the African"
4946,XLV.,women to be as strong as our men.... Not only did I see the proof of it
4947,XLV.,"in their work and in the weights which they lifted, but on examining"
4948,XLV.,their arms I found them large and hard beyond all my previous
4949,XLV.,"experience. On the contrary, I saw the men of these tribes to be weak,"
4950,XLV.,their muscles small and flabby. Both facts are accounted for by the
4951,XLV.,habits of the people. The men are lazy in the extreme; all the hard work
4952,XLV.,"is done by the women.”—(_Westminster Review_, Oct., 1865, p. 355.)"

4959,XLV.,
4960,XLV.,_Id._... In this context it is pleasant to find in the newspapers such a
4961,XLV.,note as the following:—
4962,XLV.,
4963,XLV.,"“The frost continued throughout West Cheshire yesterday, and skating"
4964,XLV.,"on rather rough ice was largely enjoyed. At Eaton, where the Duke of"
4965,XLV.,"Westminster is entertaining a party, the guests had a hockey match on"
4966,XLV.,"the frozen fish-pond in front of the hall. The players, who kept the"
4967,XLV.,"game up with spirit for over an hour, included the Duchess of"
4968,XLV.,"Westminster, the Marquis and Marchioness of Ormonde, Lady Beatrice and"
4969,XLV.,"Lady Constance Buller, Lord Arthur Grosvenor, Lord Gerald Grosvenor,"
4970,XLV.,"Lady Margaret and Lady Mary Grosvenor, Captain and Mrs. Cawley, Hon."

4972,XLV.,"Hall, and party.”—(_Manchester Courier_, 12th Jan., 1892.)"
4973,XLV.,
4974,XLV.,Later on in the year we read in the journal _Woman_:—
4975,XLV.,
4976,XLV.,"“At the Marlow Regatta an extremely pretty girl in navy serge, built"
4977,XLV.,"Eton fashion, was a Miss ——, who wore as an under-bodice a full vest"
4978,XLV.,of shaded yellow Indian silk. Her prowess with the oar is the cause of
4979,XLV.,daily admiration to the Marlowites.”
4980,XLV.,
4981,XLV.,"Again, on August 15th, 1892, the _Manchester Evening Mail_ has the"
4982,XLV.,following:—
4983,XLV.,
4984,XLV.,"“An ailing ‘navvy,’ who has been engaged in some works near"
4985,XLV.,"Versailles, was a few days ago admitted to a hospital in that town."
4986,XLV.,Before the sick person had long been in the institution it was
4987,XLV.,discovered that the apparent ‘navvy’ was a woman. The superintendent
4988,XLV.,of the hospital was not in the least surprised on hearing of the
4989,XLV.,"transformation scene, for it appears that he is accustomed to deal"
4990,XLV.,with many woman patients who enter the hospital in male attire. It is
4991,XLV.,common in the district (says a Paris correspondent) for robust women
4992,XLV.,to don men’s garb in order to obtain remunerative employment as
4993,XLV.,"navvies, porters, farm labourers, road menders, or assistants to"
4994,XLV.,"bricklayers, masons, and builders. It has long been established that"
4995,XLV.,the average Frenchwoman of town or country has as great a capacity for
4996,XLV.,"work either in counting-houses, shops, fields, or farms as her lord"
4997,XLV.,"and master has for laziness and lolling in the cafés, playing"
4998,XLV.,"dominoes, and smoking cigarettes.”"
4999,XLV.,
5000,XLV.,"On the preceding day, August 14th, 1892, the St. Petersburg journals"
5001,XLV.,reported that:—
5002,XLV.,
5003,XLV.,“Ces jours-ci sera érigé à Sébastopol le monument élevé en l’honneur
5004,XLV.,"des Femmes de cette ville qui, en 1854, ont construit seules une"
5005,XLV.,batterie contre les troupes alliées. C’est une pyramide taillée en
5006,XLV.,granit d’une hauteur de cinquante pieds. Sur un côté est écrit en
5007,XLV.,lettres d’or: ‘C’est ici que se trouvait la batterie des Femmes’; sur
5008,XLV.,"l’autre face les mots suivants sont gravés: ‘A cet endroit, en 1854,"
5009,XLV.,les Femmes de Sébastopol ont construit une batterie.’ Le jour de
5010,XLV.,l’inauguration de ce monument n’est pas encore fixé. L’impératrice se
5011,XLV.,fera représenter à l’inauguration par un grand-duc.”
5012,XLV.,
5013,XLV.,"And, in October, 1892, the “sporting” newspapers recorded that:—"
5014,XLV.,
5015,XLV.,“Women are gradually coming to the fore as bicycle riders. Miss
5016,XLV.,"Dudley, a well-known rider, has just accomplished a feat which would"
5017,XLV.,have seemed wonderful for any rider not long ago. She has ridden from
5018,XLV.,"a spot near Hitchin to Lincoln, a distance of 100 miles, in little"
5019,XLV.,"more than seven hours, or at the average speed of about fourteen miles"
5020,XLV.,"an hour. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are well-known as tandem riders, and they"
5021,XLV.,"have won many races together; but this is, perhaps, the first recorded"
5022,XLV.,"instance of a woman cyclist holding her own so well, unaided, in a"

5036,XLV.,

5118,XLVI.,of the central evolutionary process of the natural world.... The older

5133,XLVI.,"solve this problem now. Fewer children will be born, and those that are"
5134,XLVI.,born will be of a higher and better physique than the present order of
5135,XLVI.,"men. The ghastly abortions, which in many parts pass muster nowadays,"
5136,XLVI.,"owing to the unnatural physical conditions of society, as men, women,"

5152,XLVI.,"existence of a human being, is one of the most responsible actions in"

5154,XLVI.,life which may be either a curse or a blessing—unless the being on whom
5155,XLVI.,it is bestowed will have at least the ordinary chances of a desirable
5156,XLVI.,"existence, is a crime against that being. And in a country either"
5157,XLVI.,"over-peopled, or threatened with being so, to produce children, beyond a"
5158,XLVI.,"very small number, with the effect of reducing the reward of labour by"
5159,XLVI.,"their competition, is a serious offence against all who live by the"

5185,XLVI.,
5186,XLVI.,“The statistician will doubtless long continue his fashion of
5187,XLVI.,confidently estimating the importance and predicting the survival of
5188,XLVI.,populations from their quantity and rate of reproduction alone; but at
5189,XLVI.,"all this, as naturalists, we can only scoff. Even the most conventional"
5190,XLVI.,"exponent of the struggle for existence among us knows, with the"
5191,XLVI.,"barbarian conquerors of old, that ‘the thicker the grass, the easier it"
5192,XLVI.,"is mown,’ that ‘the wolf cares not how many the sheep may be.’ It is the"
5193,XLVI.,"most individuated type that prevails in spite, nay, in another sense,"
5194,XLVI.,"positively because of its slower increase; in a word, the survival of a"
5195,XLVI.,"species or family depends not primarily upon quantity, but upon quality."
5196,XLVI.,"The future is not to the most numerous population, but to the most"
5197,XLVI.,individuated....
5198,XLVI.,
5199,XLVI.,"“Apart from the pressure of population, it is time to be learning (1)"
5200,XLVI.,"That the annual child-bearing still so common, is cruelly exhaustive to"
5201,XLVI.,"the maternal life, and this often in actual duration as well as quality;"
5202,XLVI.,(2) That it is similarly injurious to the standard of offspring; and
5203,XLVI.,"hence, (3) That an interval of two clear years between births (some"
5204,XLVI.,gynæcologists even go as far as three) is due alike to mother and
5205,XLVI.,offspring.” (It is to be noted that this period of three years is
5206,XLVI.,postulated as a necessity for the well-being of the offspring; it is by
5207,XLVI.,no means a recommendation to even a triennial maternity on the part of
5208,XLVI.,"the mother, who is indeed to be, in all fulness, “free mistress of her"
5209,XLVI.,"person’s sacred plan,” with a duty to herself, as well as to her child)."
5210,XLVI.,"“It is time, therefore, as we heard a brave parson tell his flock"
5211,XLVI.,"lately, ‘to have done with that blasphemous whining which constantly"
5212,XLVI.,"tries to look at a motherless’ (ay, or sometimes even fatherless) ‘crowd"
5213,XLVI.,of puny infants as a dispensation of mysterious providence.’ Let us
5214,XLVI.,"frankly face the biological facts, and admit that such cases usually"
5215,XLVI.,illustrate only the extreme organic nemesis of intemperance and
5216,XLVI.,"improvidence, and these of a kind far more reprehensible than those"
5217,XLVI.,"actions to which common custom applies the names, since they are"
5218,XLVI.,"species-regarding vices, and not merely self-regarding ones, as the"
5219,XLVI.,others at least primarily are....
5220,XLVI.,
5221,XLVI.,"“It seems to us, however, essential to recognise that the ideal to be"
5222,XLVI.,"sought after is not merely a controlled rate of increase, but regulated"
5223,XLVI.,"married lives.... We would urge, in fact, the necessity of an ethical"
5224,XLVI.,"rather than of a mechanical ‘prudence after marriage,’ of a temperance"
5225,XLVI.,recognised to be as binding on husband and wife as chastity on the
5226,XLVI.,unmarried.... Just as we would protest against the dictum of false
5227,XLVI.,"physicians who preach indulgence rather than restraint, so we must"
5228,XLVI.,protest against regarding artificial means of preventing fertilisation
5229,XLVI.,"as adequate solutions of sexual responsibility. After all, the solution"
5230,XLVI.,is primarily one of temperance. It is no new nor unattainable ideal to
5231,XLVI.,"retain, throughout married life, a large measure of that self-control"
5232,XLVI.,which must always form the organic basis of the enthusiasm and idealism
5233,XLVI.,"of lovers.”—Geddes and Thomson (“The Evolution of Sex,” Chap. XX.)."
5234,XLVI.,
5235,XLVI.,As a fitting exemplification of the words of the “parson” above
5236,XLVI.,"narrated, compare the following verbatim extract from a conversation"
5237,XLVI.,"in this year of grace 1892. The —— referred to is a man about 35,"
5238,XLVI.,"middle-class, and of “good ‘education’” (!) The same description would"
5239,XLVI.,"also apply to the speaker, who said, “Poor —— is a brave fellow, and"
5240,XLVI.,keeps up his head in the worst of luck. He has a lot of home troubles;
5241,XLVI.,"he has lost three children, and his wife always has a bad time at the"
5242,XLVI.,birth of each baby.”
5243,XLVI.,
5244,XLVI.,"No word of sympathy for the wife and mother, or even of recognition"
5245,XLVI.,that it was really _she_ who bore the pain at each “bad time.” As the
5246,XLVI.,"children left alive still numbered two at the time of the speech, the"
5247,XLVI.,whole incident can but imply—on the part of both actor and speaker—the
5248,XLVI.,"hideous, even if unconscious, inhumanity so widely prevalent. Never"
5249,XLVI.,will “high-born breed” be attained till such action of low-bred
5250,XLVI.,intellect is reprobated and amended; in accordance with the enunciated
5251,XLVI.,"truth, that:—"

5253,XLVI.,"“Especially in higher organisms, a distinction must obviously be drawn"
5254,XLVI.,between the period at which it is possible for males and females to
5255,XLVI.,"unite in fertile sexual union, and the period at which such union will"

5289,XLVI.,attain her own development. But after the hour when her faith in the
5290,XLVI.,hope of worthy results fails her (reason instructing her nobler
5291,XLVI.,"affections by holding candidly in view all the premises, past, present,"

5293,XLVI.,"career, whether it be of the daughter, sister, mother, wife, or friend,"
5294,XLVI.,to a close. For the inferior cannot possibly be worth the sacrifice of

5296,XLVI.,temporary descent of the nobler to the less noble—the higher to the

5304,XLVI.,"degraded marriage, and prevented either sex from being what it should be"
5305,XLVI.,"to itself or the other.... Woman, self-controlled, would never be"
5306,XLVI.,absorbed by any relations; it would be only an experience to her as to
5307,XLVI.,"man. It is a vulgar error that love, a love to woman, is her whole"

5314,XLVI.,shows that progress of the cause of female enfranchisement is identified
5315,XLVI.,"with the progress of humanity.”—(_Review of Reviews_, Vol. V., p. 177.)"

5319,XLVI.,“When such social changes have been effected that no woman will be
5320,XLVI.,"compelled, either by hunger, isolation, or social compulsion, to sell"
5321,XLVI.,"herself, whether in or out of wedlock, and when all women alike shall"
5322,XLVI.,"feel the refining influence of a true humanising education, of beautiful"
5323,XLVI.,"and elevating surroundings, and of a public opinion which shall be"
5324,XLVI.,"founded on the highest aspirations of their age and country, the result"
5325,XLVI.,will be a form of human selection which will bring about a continuous
5326,XLVI.,"advance in the average status of the race. Under such conditions, all"
5327,XLVI.,"who are deformed either in body or mind, though they may be able to lead"
5328,XLVI.,"happy and contented lives, will, as a rule, leave no children to inherit"
5329,XLVI.,their deformity. Even now we find many women who never marry because
5330,XLVI.,they have never found the man of their ideal. When no woman will be
5331,XLVI.,"compelled to marry for a bare living or for a comfortable home, those"
5332,XLVI.,"who remain unmarried from their own free choice will certainly increase,"
5333,XLVI.,"while many others, having no inducement to an early marriage, will wait"
5334,XLVI.,till they meet with a partner who is really congenial to them.
5335,XLVI.,
5336,XLVI.,"“In such a reformed society the vicious man, the man of degraded taste"
5337,XLVI.,"or feeble intellect, will have little chance of finding a wife, and his"
5338,XLVI.,bad qualities will die out with himself. The most perfect and beautiful
5339,XLVI.,"in body and mind will, on the other hand, be most sought, and,"
5340,XLVI.,"therefore, be most likely to marry early, the less highly endowed later,"

5564,LIV.,"Mr. Lawson Tait says, with the indignation of a truly scientific mind at"
5565,LIV.,these methods of “science falsely so called”:—
5566,LIV.,
5567,LIV.,"“For one, as intimately and widely concerned in the application of"
5568,LIV.,human knowledge for the saving of human life and the relief of human
5569,LIV.,"suffering as anyone can be, or as anyone has ever been, I say I am"
5570,LIV.,grateful for the restrictive legislation. Let me give one brief
5571,LIV.,illustration of my most recent experience in this matter as one of
5572,LIV.,hundreds which confirm me in my determination persistently to oppose
5573,LIV.,the introduction into England of what passes for science in Germany.
5574,LIV.,Some few years ago I began to deal with one of the most dreadful
5575,LIV.,calamities to which humanity is subject by means of an operation which
5576,LIV.,had been scientifically proposed nearly two hundred years ago. I mean
5577,LIV.,ectopic gestation. The _rationale_ of the proposed operation was fully
5578,LIV.,"explained about fifty years ago, but the whole physiology of the"
5579,LIV.,normal process and the pathology of the perverted one were obscured
5580,LIV.,and misrepresented by a French physiologist’s experiments on rabbits
5581,LIV.,"and dogs. Nothing was done, and at least ninety-five per cent. of the"
5582,LIV.,victims of this catastrophe were allowed to die.
5583,LIV.,
5584,LIV.,"“I went outside the experimentalists’ conclusions, went back to the"
5585,LIV.,"true science of the old pathologist and of the surgeon of 1701, and"
5586,LIV.,performed the operation in scores of cases with almost uniform
5587,LIV.,"success. My example was immediately followed throughout the world, and"
5588,LIV.,during the last five or six years hundreds if not thousands of women’s
5589,LIV.,"lives have been saved, whilst for nearly forty years the simple road"
5590,LIV.,to this gigantic success was closed by the folly of a vivisector....
5591,LIV.,
5592,LIV.,“Views such as mine are those of a minority of my professional
5593,LIV.,"brethren, and are generally sneered at as those of a crank. But my"
5594,LIV.,"reply to this is that they form the new belief, that of the coming"
5595,LIV.,"generation, and that not one in fifty of the bulk of my present"
5596,LIV.,"brethren have ever seriously gone into the question, and probably have"
5597,LIV.,never seen a single experiment on a living animal.
5598,LIV.,
5599,LIV.,"“My address as the Surgical Orator of 1890, when the British Medical"
5600,LIV.,"Association met in this town, was mainly directed to the mischievous"
5601,LIV.,"system of so-called scientific training, of purely German origin and"
5602,LIV.,thoroughly repugnant to our English tastes and our English
5603,LIV.,common-sense.
5604,LIV.,
5605,LIV.,“It is therefore a satisfactory matter to know that the Council of
5606,LIV.,"Mason’s College would have none of it, and that the governing body of"
5607,LIV.,the new University College of Nottingham has recently decided
5608,LIV.,similarly. The Medical School of Queen’s College is now united
5609,LIV.,"entirely with the Science School of Mason’s College; but we, of"
5610,LIV.,"Mason’s College, have had the direction of the science teaching of the"
5611,LIV.,"Medical School for several years, we have had no German scientific"

5617,LIV.,"At the Congress, as above, Professor Horsley made aspersions on Miss"
5618,LIV.,"Frances Power Cobbe, as to statements concerning Vivisection in her"
5619,LIV.,"work, “The Nine Circles.” The professor declared some of the reported"
5620,LIV.,"cruel experiments to have been painless, owing to the victims being"
5621,LIV.,"under the influence of anæsthetics. In reply to the attack, the"
5622,LIV.,following preliminary letter from Miss Cobbe was then published:—
5623,LIV.,
5624,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’

5628,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,shall endeavour to give as soon as may be possible at this distance
5629,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,from the books whence the impugned passages are derived. I shall be

5634,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"most cases, have been vitiated had real and absolute anæsthesia been"
5635,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,produced in the victims. Should a small number of the experiments
5636,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"cited in the ‘Nine Circles’ prove, however, to have been performed on"
5637,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"animals in an entirely painless state, I shall, while withdrawing them"
5638,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"with apologies from a forthcoming new edition of the book, take care"
5639,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,at the same time to call attention to the multitude of other
5640,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"experiments, home and foreign, therein recorded—e.g., baking to death,"
5641,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"poisoning, starving, creating all manner of diseases, inoculating in"

5645,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,
5646,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"Miss Cobbe concludes by a sharp, but just, criticism on her critic, and"
5647,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,with an acute diagnosis of the learned vivisectionist’s own condition:—
5648,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,
5649,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,“The tone of Dr. Horsley’s remarks against me personally will probably
5650,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,inspire those who know me and the history of my connexion with the
5651,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,anti-vivisection cause with an amused sense of the difficulty wherein
5652,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"the Professor must have found himself when, instead of argument in"
5653,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"defence of vivisection, he thus turned to ‘abuse the plaintiffs’"
5654,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,attorney.’ For myself I gladly accept such abuse (or mere bluster) as
5655,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"evidence that the consciences even of eminent vivisectors are, like"
5656,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"their victims’ nerves, imperfectly under the influence of the"
5657,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"scientific anæsthesia, and remain still sensitive to the"
5658,“TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘TIMES.’,"heart-pricking charge which I bring against them, of cowardly cruelty"

5667,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,has gone on while “Woman Free” is passing through the press; the

5670,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"anæsthetic had been administered prior to the act of living anatomy,"
5671,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,otherwise admittedly true in every detail. The vivisectors lay what
5672,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"stress they can on the omissions; indeed, their principal advocate has"
5673,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,made use of a grossness of imputation and a coarseness of invective that
5674,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,augurs ill for any gentleness of treatment or purpose being existent in
5675,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,the organism of such an operator.
5676,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,
5677,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"Yet, in truth, it is not a matter of surpassing import whether the"
5678,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,assertion of the operation (alone) being conducted under an anæsthetic
5679,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"be indubitable, since the after-consequences of pain or incommodity had"
5680,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,to be endured by the victim without anæsthetics. What initial
5681,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,chloroforming could ward off the constant after-suffering attendant on
5682,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,the incubation of the disease for the creation of which the “operation”
5683,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"had been performed, a period acknowledgedly often lasting for weeks, and"
5684,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,terminated only by death’s mercy? Or what medicament could anæsthetise
5685,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,the impotent yearning—to feed her starving puppy—of a poor mother dog
5686,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"whose mammary glands had been excised, even if the “operation” had been"
5687,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"carried out “under chloroform”? Mr. Edward Berdoe, M.R.C.S., reproduces"
5688,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"and reprobates the incident with horror in the _Times_ of Oct. 27,"
5689,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,1892:—
5690,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,
5691,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,“Professor Goltz amputated the breast of the mother of a puppy nursing
5692,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,her young ... who ‘unceasingly licked the living puppy with the same
5693,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,tenderness as an uninjured dog might do.’”
5694,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,
5695,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,Most gladly may we turn to the words and ways of worthier seekers after
5696,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"truth. Professor Lawson Tait is reported by the _Standard_, 28th Oct.,"
5697,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"1892, as saying at a meeting the previous day:—"
5698,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,
5699,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,“Vivisection was a survival from mediæval times. It could not be
5700,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,justified by any results that it had produced. In days when they could
5701,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,tell the composition of the atmosphere of Orion by means of the
5702,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"spectroscope, it was a disgrace that men should resort to vivisection,"
5703,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,instead of perfecting other and more humane means of research.”
5704,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,
5705,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"There speaks true science. And, on a later occasion, Mr. Lawson Tait"
5706,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"quotes the celebrated anatomist, Sir Charles Bell (who had been falsely"

5710,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,

5714,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,of anatomy and natural motions.... For my own part I cannot believe
5715,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,that Providence should intend that the secrets of nature are to be
5716,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,"discovered by means of cruelty, and I am sure that those who are"
5717,FRANCES POWER COBBE.,guilty of protracted cruelties do not possess minds capable of

5828,LVII.,
5829,LVII.,“The Woman question will not down. She is asserting herself in every
5830,LVII.,"direction, and generally with considerable force. In America she is"
5831,LVII.,positively alarming the lords of creation by her rapid progress in
5832,LVII.,educational matters. She is actually outrunning the men in the race
5833,LVII.,"for intellectual attainments. And this fact is becoming so evident,"
5834,LVII.,"and so prominent, that a new problem is being evolved from it. This"
5835,LVII.,"is, how are the finely educated young women of America to find"
5836,LVII.,congenial husbands? It is assumed by some writers that already there
5837,LVII.,is a great disparity between the culture of the young men and young
5838,LVII.,"women, and that every year the chasm between them is becoming deeper"
5839,LVII.,"and wider. This is a truly lamentable state of things, but the woman"
5840,LVII.,movement in this country is likely to take a more practical course.
5841,LVII.,The agitation of the question of Woman Suffrage may bring about a
5842,LVII.,reaction against her excessive culture. If woman is permitted to enter

5846,LVII.,
5847,LVII.,It is refreshing and consolatory to revert from such verbiage to what
5848,LVII.,"Sir Humphrey Davy said (“Lectures, 1810 and 1811”): “It has been too"
5849,LVII.,much the custom to endeavour to attach ridicule to the literary and

5882,LVII.,"We have seen (Note XLV., 5) how Professor Huxley postulates scientific"
5883,LVII.,training equally for girls and boys; he has also said:—“Emancipate
5884,LVII.,"girls. Recognise the fact that they share the senses, perceptions,"
5885,LVII.,"feelings, reasoning powers, emotions of boys, and that the mind of the"
5886,LVII.,"average girl is less different from that of the average boy, than the"
5887,LVII.,mind of one boy is from that of another; so that whatever argument
5888,LVII.,"justifies a given education for all boys, justifies its application to"
5889,LVII.,"girls as well.”—(“Emancipation, _Black and White_.”)"
5890,LVII.,
5891,LVII.,Balzac asserted: “A woman who has received a masculine education
5892,LVII.,"possesses the most brilliant and fertile qualities, with which to secure"
5893,LVII.,"the happiness of her husband and herself.”—(“Physiologie du Mariage,”"
5894,LVII.,Méditation XI.).
5895,LVII.,
5896,LVII.,But the instances are innumerable where the intellect of higher men
5897,LVII.,expressly or unconsciously rebukes the jealous sexual conceit of their
5898,LVII.,"less intelligent brethren. Dr. Bonavia says, very tersely:—“The fact is,"
5899,LVII.,many men don’t like the idea of being surpassed or even equalled by
5900,LVII.,"women. They stupidly feel their dignity wounded. This jealousy, however,"
5901,LVII.,"is not only extremely contemptible and unjust, but disastrous to the"
5902,LVII.,"true interests of the race, for men have mothers _as well as women_, and"
5903,LVII.,imbecility—the result of atrophied frontal lobes—is just as likely to be
5904,LVII.,"transmitted to the one sex as to the other, as far as we yet know. Just"
5905,LVII.,see the injustice of men’s jealousy in matters of intellect. Only
5906,LVII.,recently the talent of Miss Ormerod—an entomologist who can hold her own
5907,LVII.,_anywhere_ on earth—was kept under by the Royal Agricultural Society.
5908,LVII.,"_She_ did the entomological work, and made the discoveries, while _they_"
5909,LVII.,took the credit. In their reports they did not even mention _her_ name
5910,LVII.,"in connection with her own work!—A more contemptible proceeding, it"
5911,LVII.,"would appear, has never been brought to light, in the struggle of the"
5912,LVII.,"sexes, if that case has been correctly reported.”—(“Woman’s Frontal"
5913,LVII.,Lobes.”)
5914,LVII.,
5915,LVII.,Bebel treats this jealousy with a fine irony in his exposition of “the
5916,LVII.,"motives which induce most medical professors, and indeed the professors"
5917,LVII.,"of every faculty, to oppose women students:”—“They regard the admission"
5918,LVII.,of women as synonymous with the degradation of science (!) which could
5919,LVII.,not but lose its prestige in the eyes of the enlightened (!) multitude
5920,LVII.,if it appeared that the female brain was capable of grasping problems
5921,LVII.,which had hitherto only been revealed to the elect of the opposite
5922,LVII.,"sex.”—(_Op. cit._, p. 132.)"
5923,LVII.,
5924,LVII.,"Had Bebel recorded masculine mercenary considerations, rather than sham"
5925,LVII.,"misgivings as to the interests of science, his sarcasm would have been"
5926,LVII.,"very grim truth. Indeed, what is sometimes called the “loaves and"
5927,LVII.,fishes” argument is at the root of most of this masculine jealousy which
5928,LVII.,cloaks itself under a pretension of tender consideration for woman’s
5929,LVII.,delicacy. To cite Bebel again: “Another objection is that it is unseemly
5930,LVII.,"to admit women to medical lectures, to operations, and deliveries, side"
5931,LVII.,by side with male students. If men see nothing indecent in studying and
5932,LVII.,examining female patients in the presence of nurses and other female
5933,LVII.,"patients, it is difficult to understand why it should become so through"
5934,LVII.,"the presence of female students.”—(_Op. cit._, p. 132.) And as to the"
5935,LVII.,actual fitness of women for exercising the profession of medicine or
5936,LVII.,surgery:—
5937,LVII.,
5938,LVII.,"“‘Women always improve when the men begin to show signs of failing,’"
5939,LVII.,"were the words of a distinguished physician and surgeon, who had seen"
5940,LVII.,years of service on a remote wintry station of the army. ‘I have had
5941,LVII.,fellows brought to me to have the leg amputated—perhaps both—close to
5942,LVII.,"the body, and never anywhere in Paris, London, or New York, saw I better"
5943,LVII.,"surgeon’s assistants than some of our women made, especially the Sisters"
5944,LVII.,"of Charity, of whom we had a few at the post, for three or four years."
5945,LVII.,Heads as clear as a silver bell; hands steady and unshrinking as a
5946,LVII.,"granite rock, yet with a touch as light as a spring leaf; foot quick and"
5947,LVII.,"indefatigable, whether the time was noonday or midnight; memory perfect;"
5948,LVII.,"tenderness for the sufferer unfailing. Talk about love, courage,"
5949,LVII.,"fortitude, and endurance in your sex! I tell you,’ he added, with a"
5950,LVII.,"needless affirmation at this point, ‘they seem to be nothing else, when"
5951,LVII.,"these are most wanted, and the man who doubts them is an ass.’”—Eliza W."
5952,LVII.,"Farnham (“Woman and Her Era,” Vol. II., p. 157). See also Note XXIX., 8."
5953,LVII.,
5954,LVII.,_Id._ ... Here may fittingly follow the report of a trained masculine
5955,LVII.,judgment as to woman’s ability in yet a further profession—that of the
5956,LVII.,law:—
5957,LVII.,
5958,LVII.,"At the recent opening of the Southern California College of Law, at Los"
5959,LVII.,"Angeles, John W. Mitchell, the president, in his lecture upon “The Study"
5960,LVII.,"of the Law,” spoke of the utility of women studying law, in the"
5961,LVII.,following language:—
5962,LVII.,
5963,LVII.,“This part of this discourse it is believed would be radically
5964,LVII.,incomplete without calling attention to one other and particular class
5965,LVII.,"of persons who need an insight into the rudiments of law—which class,"
5966,LVII.,"it seems, has also been neglected by those occupying a like position"
5967,LVII.,"to my own—I mean the women. He is, indeed, blind to the signs of the"
5968,LVII.,"times who does not recognise the expanding field of women’s work, and"
5969,LVII.,their increased influence in the professions as well as in the fine
5970,LVII.,"arts. That women are entering the lists with men, in behalf of"
5971,LVII.,"themselves and womankind, is well; for they must make up their minds"
5972,LVII.,"to take up the task of urging the reforms they need, and must solve"
5973,LVII.,the woman problem in all its bearings. Women are doing this. They are
5974,LVII.,"becoming competitors with men in the pursuits of life, it is true; but"
5975,LVII.,it is as much from necessity as choice. But it is not only the women
5976,LVII.,who have to labour and earn their own living who need legal knowledge
5977,LVII.,"to aid them. It is more needful to the woman of property, be her"
5978,LVII.,possessions but an humble home or a colossal fortune; whether she be
5979,LVII.,married or single. Women want this experience to make them cautious of
5980,LVII.,"jeopardising their rights, and less confiding in business matters. The"
5981,LVII.,courts are full of cases showing how women have been wrongly stripped
5982,LVII.,"of their belongings. And, perhaps, if one woman had known the legal"
5983,LVII.,"effect of some of her acts, one of the largest fortunes ever amassed"
5984,LVII.,in this State of Crœsus-like wealth would not have been carried to
5985,LVII.,"distant States, and there scandalously distributed amongst scheming"
5986,LVII.,"adventurers and lawyers, making a little Massachusetts county-seat the"
5987,LVII.,theatre of one of the most remarkable contests for a fortune in the
5988,LVII.,whole annals of probate court law.
5989,LVII.,
5990,LVII.,"“As to the professions: women were for a long time barred from them,"
5991,LVII.,"but now the barriers to all of them have been removed, and there is"
5992,LVII.,not a profession in which women are not distinguished. They have
5993,LVII.,graduated in the sciences from most universities with the highest
5994,LVII.,"honours, and have stood the same tests as the men. The law was about"
5995,LVII.,"the last to admit them within its precincts, and there they are"
5996,LVII.,"meeting with an unexpected measure of success. Not only in this, but"
5997,LVII.,"in other countries, there are successful women practitioners. And in"
5998,LVII.,"France, where the preparatory course is most arduous, and the term of"
5999,LVII.,"study longest, a woman recently took the highest rank over 500 men in"
6000,LVII.,"her graduating examinations, and during the whole six years of class"
6001,LVII.,study she only lost one day from her work—an example that is commended
6002,LVII.,"to you students. Undoubtedly, the weight of the argument is in favour"
6003,LVII.,"of women studying law.”—(_Women’s Journal_, Boston, U.S., 6th"
6004,LVII.,"February, 1892.)"
6005,LVII.,
6006,LVII.,_Id._... Even the vaunted politeness and gallantry of the Frenchman is
6007,LVII.,not proof against the far more deeply-bedded masculine jealousy. M. de
6008,LVII.,"Blowitz, the erudite correspondent at Paris of the _Times_, reports"
6009,LVII.,that—
6010,LVII.,
6011,LVII.,"“The law students yesterday hooted down Mdlle. Jeanne Chauvin, 28"
6012,LVII.,"years of age, who was to have argued a thesis for a legal degree. She"
6013,LVII.,"had chosen as her theme, ‘The Professions accessible to Women and the"
6014,LVII.,Historical Evolution of the Economic Position of Woman in Society.’
6015,LVII.,The uproar was such that the examiner postponed the ceremony _sine
6016,LVII.,die_. Mdlle. Chauvin is the first Frenchwoman who has sought a legal
6017,LVII.,"degree, but two years ago a Roumanian lady went through the ordeal"
6018,LVII.,"without obstruction.”—(The _Times_, July 4, 1892.)"
6019,LVII.,
6020,LVII.,"To revert to the “loaves and fishes” argument, an incident now to be"
6021,LVII.,given will show that medicine and the law are not the only professions
6022,LVII.,in which the objections to the equal status of the sexes are largely
6023,LVII.,prompted by a “jalousie de métier” of a selfish and mercenary
6024,LVII.,character:—

6060,"“‘MY DEAR PROFESSOR ALDIS,",support their admission to the B.A. degree_. Into their—mostly

6063,"“‘MY DEAR PROFESSOR ALDIS,","which might be introduced), to admission to M.A., and consequently to"

6105,LVIII.,
6106,LVIII.,On women of medical education especially is the duty incumbent to
6107,LVIII.,investigate the world of biological experience in woman. They may not
6108,LVIII.,"sit quietly down and assume that in learning all that man has to teach,"
6109,LVIII.,"they rest his equals, and that the last word has been said on the"
6110,LVIII.,"matter. They have a field of exploration, with opportunities, with"
6111,LVIII.,"implements, and with capacities, which man cannot have. His research on"
6112,LVIII.,such a question as the recognisedly most vital one of human embryology
6113,LVIII.,"with all its issues, can get but rare and uncertain light from"
6114,LVIII.,"accidental occasions, and is, moreover, simply as it were a dead"
6115,LVIII.,anatomising; nor can he by any means reach the psychic or introspective
6116,LVIII.,"phase of enquiry; but woman has the live subject, body and soul, in her"
6117,LVIII.,"own organism, to study at her leisure. Does she not yet see how to grasp"
6118,LVIII.,such further living knowledge? But that is the very quest here
6119,LVIII.,"indicated. The askidian also had no strength of vision, yet we can now"
6120,LVIII.,tell and test the light and the components of distant spheres.
6121,LVIII.,
6122,LVIII.,"There are, undoubtedly, what may be termed intelligent operations"
6123,LVIII.,"carried on in the body unconsciously to oneself, or at any rate beyond"
6124,LVIII.,the present ken of one’s actively perceptive and volitional faculties.
6125,LVIII.,"Observation and recognition of these is to be striven for, and even"
6126,LVIII.,guidance or command of them may be ours in a worthy future. The _Times_
6127,LVIII.,"of 27th January, 1892, reported a lecture at the Royal Institution on"
6128,LVIII.,"the previous day by Professor Victor Horsley, in the course of which the"
6129,LVIII.,lecturer—
6130,LVIII.,
6131,LVIII.,"“... pointed out the pineal gland, which Descartes thought to be the"
6132,LVIII.,"seat of the soul, but which was now known to be an invertebrate eye."
6133,LVIII.,He also explained the functions of certain small masses of grey
6134,LVIII.,"matter, which are two, viz.—sight and equilibration. The optic nerve"
6135,LVIII.,"was situated close to the crura, and equilibration was subserved by"
6136,LVIII.,"the cerebellum. After referring to the basal ganglia, Professor"
6137,LVIII.,Horsley admitted that as science advanced we seem to know less and
6138,LVIII.,less about the specific functions of the various masses of grey
6139,LVIII.,"matter, and less definite views than formerly prevailed were now held"
6140,LVIII.,with respect to the local source of what are termed voluntary
6141,LVIII.,"impulses, and that of sensations.... We were still in ignorance as to"
6142,LVIII.,"the functions of the optic thalamus, and of the corpus striatum. Those"
6143,LVIII.,of the cortex had to some extent been ascertained. They might be
6144,LVIII.,"divided into three classes, viz.—movement, sensation, and what was"
6145,LVIII.,termed mental phenomena. But we were still in the dark as to those
6146,LVIII.,"portions of the brain which subserved intellectual operations, memory,"
6147,LVIII.,and emotional impulses. A like ignorance prevailed with respect to the
6148,LVIII.,basal ganglia.”

6230,LIX.,"that natural progress towards a far distant future for the human race,"
6231,LIX.,"such as its past history may warrant us in anticipating. For, as Mr."
6232,LIX.,"Wallace points out, those natural influences which have hitherto"
6233,LIX.,"promoted man’s progress ‘still acting on his mental organisation, must"
6234,LIX.,ever lead to the more perfect adaptation of man’s higher faculties to
6235,LIX.,the conditions of surrounding nature and to the exigencies of the social
6236,LIX.,"state,’ so that ‘his mental constitution may continue to advance and"
6237,LIX.,"improve, till the world is again inhabited by a single, nearly"
6238,LIX.,"homogeneous race, no individual of which will be inferior to the noblest"

6280,LIX.,"all good influences towards that development, which, being the best for"
6281,LIX.,"their individual lives, will also coincide with what is best for the"

6624,EPILOGUE.,That woman is not incapable of equal mental and physical power with man:
6625,EPILOGUE.,
6626,EPILOGUE.,"That where any inferiority on her part at present exists, it is but as"
6627,EPILOGUE.,"the inherited result of long ages of misuse of her functions, and of"
6628,EPILOGUE.,want of training of her faculties:
6629,EPILOGUE.,
6630,EPILOGUE.,That an intelligent education in both directions can repair these
6631,EPILOGUE.,"wrongs, and establish her due individuality, and her equal share in"
6632,EPILOGUE.,human right and happiness:
6633,EPILOGUE.,
6634,EPILOGUE.,“That the principle which regulates the existing social relations
6635,EPILOGUE.,between the two sexes—the legal subordination of one sex to the other—is
6636,EPILOGUE.,wrong in itself and now one of the chief hindrances to human
6637,EPILOGUE.,improvement; and that it ought to be replaced by a principle of perfect
6638,EPILOGUE.,"equality, admitting no power or privilege on the one side, nor"
6639,EPILOGUE.,"disability on the other”—(JOHN STUART MILL, “The Subjection of Women,”"
6640,EPILOGUE.,Ch. I.):
6641,EPILOGUE.,
6642,EPILOGUE.,"And that, as the result of woman’s amended position, the whole human"
6643,EPILOGUE.,race will benefit physically and psychically.
6644,EPILOGUE.,
6645,EPILOGUE.,
6646,EPILOGUE.,"Thus much, at least, may be fairly concluded from the “Notes” here"
6647,EPILOGUE.,presented; in the gathering together of which scattered rays—thoughts
6648,EPILOGUE.,"and experiences from many an observant mind—into one focus, to offer"
6649,EPILOGUE.,"light and warmth to suffering womanhood and humanity, the main purpose"
6650,EPILOGUE.,of this book is accomplished.
