47,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,
48,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,_Dear Sister: Hear the conclusion of the whole matter. You dream like
49,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,"mad, you love like tinder, you aspire like a star-struck moth--for what?"
50,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,"That you may hive little lyrics, and sell to a publisher for thirty"
51,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,pieces of silver.
52,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,
53,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,Hard by us here is a 'bee-farm.' It always reminds me of a publisher's.
54,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,"The bee has loved a thousand flowers, through a hundred afternoons, he"
55,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,has filled little sacred cells with the gold of his stolen kisses--for
56,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,what? That the whole should be wrenched away and sold at so much 'the
57,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,comb'--as though it were a hair-comb. 'Mummy is become merchandise ...
58,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,and Pharaoh is sold for balsams.'
59,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,
60,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,"Can we ever forget those old mornings when we rose with the lark, and,"
61,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,"while the earliest sunlight slanted through the sleeping house, stole to"
62,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,"the little bookclad study to read--Heaven bless us!--you, perhaps, Mary"
63,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,"Wollstonecraft, and I, Livy, in a Froben folio of 1531!!"
64,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,
65,EPISTLE DEDICATORY,"Will you accept these old verses in memory of those old mornings? Ah,"

229,TO THE READER,
230,TO THE READER,"_Art was a palace once, things great and fair,"
231,TO THE READER,"And strong and holy, found a temple there:"
232,TO THE READER,Now 'tis a lazar-house of leprous men.
233,TO THE READER,O shall me hear an English song again!
234,TO THE READER,"Still English larks mount in the merry morn,"
235,TO THE READER,"An English May still brings an English thorn,"
236,TO THE READER,"Still English daisies up and down the grass,"
237,TO THE READER,Still English love for English lad and lass--
238,TO THE READER,Yet youngsters blush to sing an English song!_
239,TO THE READER,
240,TO THE READER,_Thou nightingale that for six hundred years
241,TO THE READER,Sang to the world--O art thou husht at last!
242,TO THE READER,"For, not of thee this new voice in our ears,"
243,TO THE READER,Music of France that once was of the spheres;
244,TO THE READER,And not of thee these strange green flowers that spring
245,TO THE READER,From daisy roots and seemed to bear a sting_.
246,TO THE READER,
247,TO THE READER,"_Thou Helicon of numbers 'undefiled,'"
248,TO THE READER,"Forgive that 'neath the shadow of thy name,"
249,TO THE READER,"England, I bring a song of little fame;"

258,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,To R.K. Leather
259,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"(July 16th, 1892.)"
260,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
261,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA
262,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
263,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,It happened in that great Italian land
264,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Where every bosom heateth with a star--
265,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"At Rimini, anigh that crumbling strand"
266,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,The Adriatic filcheth near and far--
267,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"In that same past where Dante's dream-days are,"
268,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,That one Francesca gave her youthful gold
269,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Unto an aged carle to bolt and bar;
270,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Though all the love which great young hearts can hold,"
271,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,How could she give that love unto a miser old?
272,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
273,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Nay! but young Paolo was the happy lad,"
274,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"A youth of dreaming eye yet dauntless foot,"
275,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Who all Francesca's wealth of loving had;
276,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"One brave to scale a wall and steal the fruit,"
277,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Nor fear because some dotard owned the root;
278,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Yea! one who wore his love like sword on thigh
279,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And kept not all his valour for his lute;
280,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,One who could dare as well as sing and sigh.
281,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Ah! then were hearts to love, but they are long gone by."
282,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
283,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Ye lily-wives so happy in the nest,"
284,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Whose joy within the gates of duty springs,"
285,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Blame not Love's poor, who, if they would be blest,"
286,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Must steal what comes to you with marriage rings:
287,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Ye pity the poor lark whose scarce-tried wings
288,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Faint in the net, while still the morning air"
289,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"With brown free throats of all his brethren sings,"
290,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And can it be ye will not pity her,"
291,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Whose youth is as a lark all lost to singing there?
292,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
293,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,In opportunity of dear-bought joy
294,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Rich were this twain, for old Lanciotto, he"
295,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Who was her lord, was brother of her boy,"
296,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And in one home together dwelt the three,"
297,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,With brothers two beside; and he and she
298,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Sat at one board together, in one fane"
299,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Their voices rose upon one hymn, ah me!"
300,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Beneath one roof each night their limbs had lain,"
301,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,As now in death they share the one eternal pain.
302,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
303,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,As much as common men can love a flower
304,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Unto Lanciotto was Francesca dear,"
305,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,'Tis not on such Love wields his jealous power;
306,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And therefore Paolo moved him not to fear,"
307,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Though he so green with youth and he so sere.
308,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Nor yet indeed was wrong, the hidden thing"
309,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Grew at each heart, unknown of each, a year,--"
310,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Two eggs still silent in the nest through spring,"
311,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"May draws so near to June, and not yet time to sing!"
312,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
313,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Yet oft, indeed, through days that gave no sign"
314,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Had but Francesca turned about and read
315,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Paolo's bright eyes that only dared to shine
316,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,On the dear gold that glorified her head;
317,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Ere all the light had from their circles fled
318,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And the grey Honour darkened all his face:
319,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"They had not come to June and nothing said,"
320,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Day followed day with such an even pace,"
321,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Nor night succeeded night and left no starry trace.
322,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
323,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Or, surely, had the flower Paolo pressed"
324,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,In some sweet volume when he put it by.
325,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Told how his mistress drew it to her breast
326,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And called upon his name when none was nigh;
327,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Had but the scarf he kissed with piteous cry
328,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"But breathed again its secret unto her,"
329,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Or had but one of every little sigh
330,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Each left for each been love's true messenger:
331,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,They surely had not kept that winter all the year.
332,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
333,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Yea! love lay hushed and waiting like a seed,"
334,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Some laggard of the season still abed
335,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Though the sun calls and gentle zephyrs plead,"
336,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And Hope that waited long must deem it dead;
337,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Yet lo! to-morrow sees its shining head
338,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Singing at dawn 'mid all the garden throng:
339,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Ah, had it known, it had been earlier sped--"
340,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Was it for fear of day it slept so long,"
341,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Or were its dreams of singing sweeter than the song?
342,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
343,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,But what poor flower can symbol all the might
344,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And all the magnitude, great Love, of thee?"
345,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Ah, is there aught can image thee aright"
346,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"In earth or heaven, how great or fair it be?"
347,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"We watch the acorn grow into the tree,"
348,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"We watch the patient spark surprise the mine,"
349,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,But what are oaks to thy Ygdrasil-tree?
350,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"What the mad mine's convulsive strength to thine,"
351,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,That wrecks a world but bids heaven's soaring steeples shine?
352,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
353,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"A god that hath no earthly metaphor,"
354,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"A blinding word that hath no earthly rhyme,"
355,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Love! we can only call and no name more;
356,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"As the great lonely thunder rolls sublime,"
357,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"As the great sun doth solitary climb,"
358,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And we have but themselves to know them by,"
359,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Just so Love stands a stranger amid Time:
360,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"The god is there, the great voice speaks on high,"
361,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"We pray, 'What art thou, Lord?' but win us no reply."
362,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
363,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"So in the dark grew Love, but feared to flower,"
364,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Dreamed to himself, but never spake a word,"
365,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Burned like a prisoned fire from hour to hour,"
366,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Sang his dear song like an unheeded bird;
367,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Waiting the summoning voice so long unheard,"
368,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Waiting with weary eyes the gracious sign
369,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"To bring his rose, and tell the dream he dared,"
370,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"The tremulous moment when the star should shine,"
371,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And each should ask of each, and each should answer"
372,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,--'Thine.'
373,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
374,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Winter to-day, but lo! to-morrow spring!"
375,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"They waited long, but oh at last it came,"
376,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Came in a silver hush at evening;
377,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Francesca toyed with threads upon a frame,"
378,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Hard by young Paolo read of knight and dame
379,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,That long ago had loved and passed away:
380,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"He had no other way to tell his flame,"
381,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,She dare not listen any other way--
382,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,But even that was bliss to lovers poor as they.
383,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
384,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,The world grew sweet with wonder in the west
385,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"The while he read and while she listened there,"
386,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And many a dream from out its silken nest
387,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Stole like a curling incense through the air;
388,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Yet looked she not on him, nor did he dare:"
389,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,But when the lovers kissed in Paradise
390,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"His voice sank and he turned his gaze on her,"
391,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Like a young bird that flutters ere it flies,--"
392,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And lo! a shining angel called him from her eyes.
393,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
394,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Then from the silence sprang a kiss like flame,"
395,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And they hung lost together; while around
396,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"The world was changed, no more to be the same"
397,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Meadow or sky, no little flower or sound"
398,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Again the same, for earth grew holy ground:"
399,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,While in the silence of the mounting moon
400,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Infinite love throbbed in the straining bound
401,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Of that great kiss, the long-delaying boon,"
402,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Granted indeed at last, but ended, ah! so soon."
403,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
404,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,As the great sobbing fulness of the sea
405,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Fills to the throat some void and aching cave,"
406,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Till all its hollows tremble silently,"
407,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Pressed with sweet weight of softly-lapping wave:
408,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,So kissed those mighty lovers glad and brave.
409,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And as a sky from which the sun has gone
410,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Trembles all night with all the stars he gave
411,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"A firmament of memories of the sun,--"
412,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,So thrilled and thrilled each life when that great kiss was done.
413,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
414,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,But coward shame that had no word to say
415,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"In passion's hour, with sudden icy clang"
416,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Slew the bright morn, and through the tarnished day"
417,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,An iron bell from light to darkness rang:
418,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"She shut her ears because a throstle sang,"
419,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"She dare not hear the little innocent bird,"
420,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And a white flower made her poor head to hang--
421,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"To be so white! once she was white as curd,"
422,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,But now--'Alack!' 'Alack!' She speaks no other word.
423,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
424,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,The pearly line on yonder hills afar
425,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Within the dawn, when mounts the lark and sings"
426,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"By the great angel of the morning star,--"
427,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"That was his love, and all free fair fresh things"
428,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,That move and glitter while the daylight springs:
429,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"To thus know love, and yet to spoil love thus!"
430,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,To lose the dream--O silly beating wings--
431,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Great dream so splendid and miraculous:
432,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"O Lord, O Lord, have mercy, have mercy upon us."
433,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
434,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,She turned her mind upon the holy ones
435,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Whose love lost here was love in heaven tenfold,"
436,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"She thought of Lucy, that most blessed of nuns"
437,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Who sent her blue eyes on a plate of gold
438,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,To him who wooed her daily for her love--
439,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"'Mine eyes!' 'Mine eyes!' 'Here,--go in peace, they are!'"
440,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"But ever love came through the midnight grove,"
441,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Young Love, with wild eyes watching from afar,"
442,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And called and called and called until the morning star.
443,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
444,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Ah, poor Francesca, 'tis not such as thou"
445,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,That up the stony steeps of heaven climb;
446,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Take thou thy heaven with thy Paolo now--
447,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Sweet saint of sin, saint of a deathless rhyme,"
448,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Song shall defend thee at the bar of Time,"
449,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Dante shall set thy fair young glowing face
450,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"On the dark background of his theme sublime,"
451,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And Thou and He in your superb disgrace
452,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Still on that golden wind of passion shall embrace.
453,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
454,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,*       *       *       *       *
455,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
456,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"So love this twain, but whither have they passed?"
457,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Ah me, that dark must always follow day,"
458,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"That Love's last kiss is surely kissed at last,"
459,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Howe'er so wildly the poor lips may pray:
460,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Merciful God, is there no other way?"
461,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And pen, O must thou of the ending write,"
462,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"The hour Lanciotto found them where they lay,"
463,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Folded together, weary with delight,"
464,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Within the sumptuous petals of the rose of night.
465,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
466,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Yea, for Lanciotto found them: many an hour"
467,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Ere their dear joy had run its doomÃ¨d date,"
468,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Had they, in silken nook and blossomed bower,"
469,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"All unsuspect the blessed apple ate,"
470,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Who now must grind its core predestinate.
471,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Kiss, kiss, poor losing lovers, nor deny"
472,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"One little tremor of its bliss, for Fate"
473,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Cometh upon you, and the dark is nigh"
474,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Where all, unkissed, unkissing, learn at length to lie."
475,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
476,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Bent on some journey of the state's concern
477,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"They deemed him, and indeed he rode thereon"
478,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,But questioned Paolo--'What if he return!'
479,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"'Nay, love, indeed he is securely gone"
480,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"As thou art surely here, beloved one,"
481,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"He went ere sundown, and our moon is here--"
482,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"A fear, love, in this heart that yet knew none!'"
483,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,How could he fright that little velvet ear
484,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,With last night's dream and all its ghostly fear!
485,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
486,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"So did he yield him to her eager breast,"
487,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And half forgot, but could not quite forget,"
488,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"No sweetest kiss could put that fear to rest,"
489,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And all its haggard vision chilled him yet;
490,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Their warder moon in nameless trouble set,"
491,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"There seemed a traitor echo in the place,"
492,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"A moaning wind that moaned for lovers met,"
493,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And once above her head's deep sunk embrace
494,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,He saw--Death at the window with his yellow face.
495,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
496,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Had that same dream caught old Lanciotto's reins,"
497,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Bent in a weary huddle on his steed,"
498,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"In darkling haste along the blindfold lanes,"
499,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Making a clattering halt in all that speed:--
500,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"'Fool! fool!' he cried, 'O dotard fool, indeed,"
501,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"So ho! they wanton while the old man rides,'"
502,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And on the night flashed pictures of the deed.
503,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"'Come!'--and he dug his charger's panting sides,"
504,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And all the homeward dark tore by in roaring tides.
505,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
506,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,As some great lord of acres when a thief
507,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Steals from his park some flower he never sees,"
508,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Calls it a lily fair beyond belief,"
509,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Prisons the wretch, and fines before he frees;"
510,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Such jealous madness did Lanciotto seize:
511,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"All in an instant is Francesca dear,"
512,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"He claims the wife he never cared to please,"
513,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"All in an instant seems his castle near,--"
514,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And those poor lovers sleep, forgot at last their fear."
515,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
516,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"His horse left steaming at his journey's end,"
517,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Up through his palace stairs with springing tread
518,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"He strode; the silence met him like a friend,"
519,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Fain to dissuade him from that deed of dread,"
520,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Making a breeze about his burning head,"
521,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Laying large hands of comfort on his soul;
522,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Within the ashes of his cheek burned red
523,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"A long-shut rose of youth, as to the goal"
524,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Of death he sped, as once to love's own tryst he stole."
525,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
526,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"He caught a sound as of a rose's breath,"
527,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"He caught another breath of deeper lung,"
528,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Rose-leaves and oak-leaves on the wind of death;
529,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,He drew aside the arras where they clung
530,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"In the dim light, so lovely and so young--"
531,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"They lay in sin as in a cradle there,"
532,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Twin babes that in one bosom nestling hung:
533,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Even Lanciotto paused, ah, will he spare?"
534,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Who could not quite forgive a wrong that is so fair!
535,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
536,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"The grave old clock ticked somewhere in the gloom,"
537,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,A dozen waiting seconds rose and fell
538,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Ere his pale dagger flickered in the room,"
539,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Then quenched its corpse-light in their bosoms' swell--
540,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"'Thus, dears, I mate you evermore in hell.'"
541,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,Their blood ran warm about them and they sighed
542,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"For the mad smiter did his work too well,"
543,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Just drew together softly and so died,"
544,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Fell very still and strange, and moved not side by side."
545,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,
546,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Yea, moved not, though two hours he watched the twain"
547,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And heard their blood drip drip upon the floor,"
548,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Twice with stern voice he spake to them again,"
549,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And then, a little tenderly, once more,--"
550,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"'Thus, dears, in hell I mate you evermore.'"
551,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,And when the curious fingers of the day
552,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"Unravelled all the dark, and morning wore,"
553,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,"And the young light played round them where they lay,"
554,PAOLO AND FRANCESCA,The souls were many leagues upon the hellward way.

561,YOUNG LOVE,N.B.--_This sequence of poems has appeared in former
562,YOUNG LOVE,editions under the title of 'Love Platonic_.'
563,YOUNG LOVE,
564,YOUNG LOVE,
565,I,I
566,I,
567,I,1
568,I,"Surely at last, O Lady, the sweet moon"
569,I,That bringeth in the happy singing weather
570,I,"Groweth to pearly queendom, and full soon"
571,I,Shall Love and Song go hand in hand together;
572,I,For all the pain that all too long hath waited
573,I,"In deep dumb darkness shall have speech at last,"
574,I,And the bright babe Death gave the Love he mated
575,I,Shall leap to light and kiss the weeping past.
576,I,
577,I,For all the silver morning is a-glimmer
578,I,"With gleaming spears of great Apollo's host,"
579,I,And the night fadeth like a spent out swimmer
580,I,Hurled from the headlands of some shining coast.
581,I,"O, happy soul, thy mouth at last is singing,"
582,I,"Drunken with wine of morning's azure deep,"
583,I,"Sing on, my soul, the world beneath thee swinging,"
584,I,A bough of song above a sea of sleep.
585,I,
586,I,2
587,I,Who is the lady I sing?
588,I,"Ah, how can I tell thee her praise"
589,I,For whom all my life's but the string
590,I,Of a rosary painful of days;
591,I,
592,I,Which I count with a curious smile
593,I,"As a miser who hoardeth his gain,"
594,I,"Though, a madhearted spendthrift the while,"
595,I,I but gather to waste again.
596,I,
597,I,"Yea, I pluck from the tree of the years,"
598,I,"As a country maid greedy of flowers,"
599,I,"Each day brimming over with tears,"
600,I,And I scatter like petals its hours;
601,I,
602,I,And I trample them under my feet
603,I,"In a frenzy of cloven-hoofed swine,"
604,I,"And the breath of their dying is sweet,"
605,I,And the blood of their hearts is as wine.
606,I,
607,I,"O, I throw me low down on the ground"
608,I,"And I bury my face in their death,"
609,I,And only I rise at the sound
610,I,"Of a wind as it scattereth,"
611,I,
612,I,As it scattereth sweetly the dried
613,I,Leaves withered and brittle and sere
614,I,Of days of old years that have died--
615,I,"And, O, it is sweet in my ear"
616,I,
617,I,And I rise me and build me a pyre
618,I,"Of the whispering skeleton things,"
619,I,"And my heart laugheth low with the fire,"
620,I,Laugheth high with the flame as it springs;
621,I,
622,I,And above in the flickering glare
623,I,"I mark me the boughs of my tree,"
624,I,"My tree of the years, growing bare."
625,I,Growing bare with the scant days to be.
626,I,
627,I,Then I turn to my beads and I pray
628,I,For the axe at the root of the tree--
629,I,"Last flower, last bead--ah! last day"
630,I,"That shall part me, my darling, from thee!"
631,I,
632,I,And I pray for the knife on the string
633,I,Of this rosary painful of days:
634,I,But who is the Lady I sing?
635,I,"Ah, how can I tell thee her praise!"
636,I,
637,I,
638,II,II
639,II,
640,II,I make this rhyme of my lady and me
641,II,"To give me ease of my misery,"
642,II,Of my lady and me I make this rhyme
643,II,For lovers in the after-time.
644,II,And I weave its warp from day to day
645,II,In a golden loom deep hid away
646,II,"In my secret heart, where no one goes"
647,II,"But my lady's self, and--no one knows."
648,II,
649,II,With bended head all day I pore
650,II,"On a joyless task, and yet before"
651,II,"My eyes all day, through each weary hour,"
652,II,Breathes my lady's face like a dewy flower.
653,II,"Like rain it comes through the dusty air,"
654,II,Like sun on the meadows to think of her;
655,II,O sweet as violets in early spring
656,II,"The flower-girls to the city bring,"
657,II,"O, healing-bright to wintry eyes"
658,II,As primrose-gold 'neath northern skies--
659,II,But O for fit thing to compare
660,II,With the joy I have in the thought of her!
661,II,So all day long doth her holy face
662,II,"Bring fragrance to the barren place,"
663,II,"And whensoe'er it comes nearest me,"
664,II,My loom it weaveth busily.
665,II,
666,II,Some days there be when the loom is still
667,II,"And my soul is sad as an autumn hill,"
668,II,But how to tell the blessed time
669,II,When my heart is one glowing prayer of rhyme!
670,II,Think on the humming afternoon
671,II,"Within some busy wood in June,"
672,II,"When nettle patches, drunk with the sun,"
673,II,Are fiery outposts of the shade;
674,II,"While gnats keep up a dizzy reel,"
675,II,"And the grasshopper, perched upon his blade,"
676,II,Loud drones his fairy threshing-wheel:--
677,II,Hour when some poet-wit might feign
678,II,The drowsy tune of the throbbing air
679,II,The weaving of the gossamer
680,II,In secret nooks of wood and lane--
681,II,"The gossamer, silk night-robes of the flowers,"
682,II,Fluttered apart by amorous morning hours.
683,II,"Yea, as the weaving of the gossamer,"
684,II,"If truly that the mystic golden boom,"
685,II,"Is the strange rapture of my hidden loom,"
686,II,As I sit in the light of the thought of her;
687,II,"And it weaveth, weaveth, day by day,"
688,II,This parti-coloured roundelay;
689,II,"Weaving for ease of misery,"
690,II,"Weaving this rhyme of my lady and me,"
691,II,"Weaving, weaving this warp of rhyme"
692,II,For lovers in the after-time.
693,II,
694,II,"My lady, lover, may never be mine"
695,II,"In the same sweet way that thine is thine,"
696,II,My lady and I may never stand
697,II,"By the holy altar hand in hand,"
698,II,My lady and I may never rest
699,II,"Through the golden midnight breast to breast,"
700,II,Nor share long days of happy light
701,II,Sweet moving in each other's sight:
702,II,"Yea, even must we ever miss"
703,II,The honey of the chastest kiss.
704,II,
705,II,
706,III,III
707,III,
708,III,"But, Song, arise thee on a greater wing,"
709,III,"Nor twitter robin-like of love, nor sing"
710,III,A pretty dalliance with grief--but try
711,III,"Some metre like a sky,"
712,III,Wherein to set
713,III,Stars that may linger yet
714,III,"When I, thy master, shall have come to die."
715,III,Twitter and tweet
716,III,Thy carollings
717,III,"Of little things,"
718,III,Of fair and sweet;
719,III,"For it is meet,"
720,III,O robin red!
721,III,That little theme
722,III,"Hath little song,"
723,III,That little head
724,III,"Hath little dream,"
725,III,And long.
726,III,"But we have starry business, such a grief"
727,III,"As Autumn's, dead by some forgotten sheaf,"
728,III,While all the distance echoes of the wain;
729,III,Grief as an ocean's for some sudden isle
730,III,"Of living green that stayed with it a while,"
731,III,Then to oblivious deluge plunged again!
732,III,"Grief as of Alps that yearn but never reach,"
733,III,"Grief as of Death for Life, of Night for Day:"
734,III,"Such grief, O Song, how hast thou strength to teach,"
735,III,How hope to make assay?

771,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,
772,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"'The daffodils are fine this year,' I said;"
773,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"'O yes, but see my crocuses,' said she."
774,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,And so we entered in and sat at talk
775,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,Within a little parlour bowered about
776,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"With garden-noises, filled with garden scent,"
777,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,As some sweet sea-shell rings with pearly chimes
778,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,And sighs out fragrance of its mother's breast.
779,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,
780,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"We sat at talk, and all the afternoon"
781,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,Whispered about in changing silences
782,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Of flush and sudden light and gathering shade,"
783,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,As though some Maestro drew out organ stops
784,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,Somewhere in heaven. As two within a boat
785,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"On the wide sea we sat at talk, the hours"
786,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,Lapping unheeded round us as the waves.
787,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"And as such two will ofttimes pause in speech,"
788,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,Gaze at high heaven and draw deep to their hearts
789,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"The infinite azure, then meet eyes again"
790,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,And flash it to each other; without words
791,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"First, and then with voice trembling as trumpets"
792,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Tremble with fierce breath, voice cadenced too"
793,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"As deep as the deep sea, Aeolian voice,"
794,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Voice of star-spaces, and the pine-wood's voice"
795,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"In dewy mornings, Life's own awful voice:"
796,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"So did We talk, gazing with God's own eyes"
797,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Into Life's deeps--ah, how they throbbed with stars!"
798,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,And were we not ourselves like pulsing suns
799,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Who, once an aeon met within the void,"
800,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"So fiery close, forget how far away"
801,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Each orbit sweeps, and dream a little space"
802,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,Of fiery wedding. So our hearts made answering
803,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,Lightnings all that afternoon through purple mists
804,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Of riddled speech; and when at last the sun,"
805,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Our sentinel, made sign beneath the trees"
806,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Of coming night, and we arose and passed"
807,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Across the threshold to the flowers again,"
808,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"We knew a presence walking in the grove,"
809,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,And a voice speaking through the evening's cool
810,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"Unknown before: though Love had wrought no wrong,"
811,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"His rune was spoken, and another rhyme"
812,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,Writ in his poem by the master Life.
813,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,
814,THE DAY OF THE TWO DAFFODILS,"'Pray, pluck me some,' I said. She brought me two,"

984,A JUNE LILY,
985,A JUNE LILY,[_The poet dramatises his Lady's loneliness_]
986,A JUNE LILY,
987,A JUNE LILY,Alone! once more alone! how like a tomb
988,A JUNE LILY,My little parlour sounds which only now
989,A JUNE LILY,Yearned like some holy chancel with his voice.
990,A JUNE LILY,So still! so empty! Surely one might fear
991,A JUNE LILY,The walls should meet in ruinous collapse
992,A JUNE LILY,That held no more his music. Yet they stand
993,A JUNE LILY,"Firm in a foolish firmness, meaningless"
994,A JUNE LILY,As frescoed sepulchre some Pharaoh built
995,A JUNE LILY,"But never came to sleep in; built, indeed,"
996,A JUNE LILY,For--that grey moth to flit in like a ghost!
997,A JUNE LILY,
998,A JUNE LILY,"Alone! another feast-day come and gone,"
999,A JUNE LILY,Watched through the weeks as in my garden there
1000,A JUNE LILY,I watch a seedling grow from blade to bud
1001,A JUNE LILY,Impatient for its blossom. So this day
1002,A JUNE LILY,"Has bloomed at last, and we have plucked its flower"
1003,A JUNE LILY,"And shared its sweetness, and once more the time"
1004,A JUNE LILY,Is as that stalk from which but now I plucked
1005,A JUNE LILY,Its last June-lily as a parting sign.
1006,A JUNE LILY,"Yea, but he seemed to love it! yet if he"
1007,A JUNE LILY,But craved it in deceit of tenderness
1008,A JUNE LILY,To make my heart glow brighter with a lie!
1009,A JUNE LILY,"Will it indeed be cherished as he said,"
1010,A JUNE LILY,"Or will he keep it near his book a while,"
1011,A JUNE LILY,"And when grown rank forget it in his glass,"
1012,A JUNE LILY,And leave it for the maid who dusts his room
1013,A JUNE LILY,To clear away and cast upon the heap?
1014,A JUNE LILY,"Or, may be, will he bury it away"
1015,A JUNE LILY,In some old drawer with other mummy-flowers?
1016,A JUNE LILY,
1017,A JUNE LILY,"Nay, but I wrong thee, dear one, thinking so."
1018,A JUNE LILY,"My boy, my love, my poet! Nay, I know"
1019,A JUNE LILY,"Thy lonely room, tomb-like to thee as mine,"
1020,A JUNE LILY,Tomb-like as tomb of some returning ghost
1021,A JUNE LILY,Seems only bright about my lily-flower.
1022,A JUNE LILY,"And, mayhap, while I wrong thee thus in thought"
1023,A JUNE LILY,"Thou bendest o'er it, feigning for some ease"
1024,A JUNE LILY,Of parted ache conceits of poet-wit
1025,A JUNE LILY,On petal and on stamen--let me try!
1026,A JUNE LILY,"If lilies be alike thine is as this,"
1027,A JUNE LILY,I wonder if thy reading tallies too.
1028,A JUNE LILY,
1029,A JUNE LILY,"Six petals with a dewdrop in their heart,"
1030,A JUNE LILY,"Six pure brave years, an ivory cup of tears;"
1031,A JUNE LILY,Six pearly-pillared stamens golden-crowned
1032,A JUNE LILY,"Growing from out the dewdrop, and a seventh"
1033,A JUNE LILY,Soaring alone trilobed and mystic green;
1034,A JUNE LILY,"Six pearl-bright years aflower with gold of joy,"
1035,A JUNE LILY,Sprung from the heart of those brave tear-fed years:
1036,A JUNE LILY,But what that seventh single stamen is
1037,A JUNE LILY,My little wit must leave for thee to tell.
1038,A JUNE LILY,
1039,A JUNE LILY,But neither poet nor a sibyl thou!
1040,A JUNE LILY,"What brave conceit had he, my poet, built;"
1041,A JUNE LILY,"No jugglery of numbers that mean nought,"
1042,A JUNE LILY,"That can mean nought for ever, unto us."

1680,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Beneath her speech of all she left unsaid.
1681,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"As--'in the kitchen,' _rather in the way,_"
1682,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"_Poor thing_; 'busy on breakfast,' _awkward time_,"
1683,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"_Indeed, for one must live and lodgers' meals_,"
1684,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"_You know, must be attended to what comes_--"
1685,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"(Or goes, I added for her) _yes! indeed_."
1686,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"'""She's gone at last,"" I said,' _and better perhaps_,"
1687,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,_For what had life for her but suffering?_
1688,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"_And then, we're only poor, sir, John and I_,"
1689,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,_And she indeed was somewhat of a strain_:
1690,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"_O! yes, it's for the best for all of us_."
1691,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,And still beneath all else methought I read
1692,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"'_What will the lodgers think, having the dead_"
1693,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,_Within the house! how inconvenient!_'
1694,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,
1695,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"What did the lodgers think? Well, I replied"
1696,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"In grief's set phrase, but 'the first floor,'"
1697,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"I fancy, frowned at first, as though indeed"
1698,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Landladies' sisters had no right to die
1699,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,And taint the air for nervous lodger folk;
1700,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Then smoothed his brow out into decency,"
1701,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"And said, 'how sad!' and presently inquired"
1702,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"The day of burial, ending with the hope"
1703,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,His lunch would not be late like yesterday.
1704,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,The maiden-lady living near the roof
1705,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Quoted Isaiah may be, or perhaps Job--"
1706,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"How the Lord gives, and likewise takes away,"
1707,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,And how exceeding blessed is the Lord!--
1708,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,For she has pious features; while downstairs
1709,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Two 'medicals'--both 'decent' lads enough--
1710,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Hearkened the story out like gentlemen,"
1711,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,And said the right thing--almost looked it too!
1712,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Though all the while within them laughed a sea
1713,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Of student mirth, which for full half an hour"
1714,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"They stifled well, but then could hold no more,"
1715,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,As soon their mad piano testified:
1716,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,While in the kitchen dinner was toward
1717,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"With hiss and bubble from the cooking stove,"
1718,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"And now a laugh from John ran up the stairs,"
1719,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,And a voice called aloud--of boiling pans.
1720,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,
1721,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"'So soon,' reflected I, 'the waters of life"
1722,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Close o'er the sunken head!' Reflected _I_,"
1723,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Not that in truth I was more pitiful
1724,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"To the poor dead than those about me were,"
1725,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Nay, but a trick of thinking much on Life"
1726,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,And Death i' the piece giveth each little strand
1727,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,More deep significance--love for the whole
1728,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Must make us tender for the parts, methinks,"
1729,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"As in some souls the equal law holds true,"
1730,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Sorrow for one makes sorrow for the world.
1731,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,A fallen leaf or a dead flower indeed
1732,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Has made me just as sad, or some poor bee"
1733,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Dead in the early summer--what's the odds?
1734,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Death was at '48,' and yet what sign?"
1735,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Who seemed to know? who could have known that called?
1736,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,For not a blind was lower than its wont--
1737,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"'The lodgers would not like them down,' you know--"
1738,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"And in all rooms, save one, the boisterous life"
1739,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Blazed like the fires within the several grates--
1740,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Save one where lay the poor dead silent thing,"
1741,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,A closest chill as who hath sat at night
1742,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,With love beside the ingle knows the ashes
1743,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,In the morning.
1744,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,
1745,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Death was at '48,'"
1746,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Yet Life and Love and Sunlight were there too.
1747,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"I ate and slept, and morning came at length"
1748,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,And brought my Lady's letter to my bed:
1749,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Thrice read and thirty kisses, came a thought,"
1750,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,As the sweet morning laughed about the room
1751,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Of the poor face downstairs, the sunshine there"
1752,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Playing about it like a wakeful child
1753,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"Whose weary mother sleepeth in the dawn,"
1754,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Pressing soft fingers round about the eyes
1755,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,"To make them open, then with laughing shout"
1756,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Making a gambol all her body's length
1757,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,Ah me! poor eyes that never open more!
1758,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,And mine as blithe to meet the morning's glance
1759,DEATH IN A LONDON LODGING,As thirsty lips to close on thirsty lips!

2411,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER)
2412,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2413,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"A poet hungered, as well he might--"
2414,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Not a morsel since yesternight!
2415,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),And sad he grew--good reason why--
2416,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),For the poet had nought wherewith to buy.
2417,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2418,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"'Are not two sparrows sold,' he cried,"
2419,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"'Sold for a farthing? and,' he sighed,"
2420,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"As he pushed his morning post away,"
2421,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),'Are not two sonnets more than they?'
2422,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2423,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Yet store of gold, great store had he,--"
2424,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Of the gold that is known as 'faery.'
2425,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"He had the gold of his burning dreams,"
2426,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"He had his golden rhymes--in reams,"
2427,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"He had the strings of his golden lyre,"
2428,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),And his own was that golden west on fire.
2429,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2430,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),But the poet knew his world too well
2431,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),To dream that such would buy or sell.
2432,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"He had his poets, 'pure gold,' he said,"
2433,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"But the man at the bookstall shook his head,"
2434,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),And offered a grudging half-a-crown
2435,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),For the five the poet had brought him down.
2436,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2437,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Ah, what a world we are in! we sigh,"
2438,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Where a lunch costs more than a Keats can buy,"
2439,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),And even Shakespeare's hallowed line
2440,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Falls short of the requisite sum to dine.
2441,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2442,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Yet other gold had the poet got,"
2443,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),For see from that grey-blue Gouda pot
2444,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Three golden tulips spouting flame--
2445,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"From his love, from his love, this morn, they came."
2446,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),His love he loved even more than fame.
2447,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2448,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Three golden tulips thrice more fair
2449,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Than other golden tulips were--
2450,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"'And yet,' he smiled as he took one up,"
2451,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"And feasted on its yellow cup,--"
2452,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),'I wonder how many eggs you'd buy!
2453,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"By Bacchus, I've half a mind to try!"
2454,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),'One golden bloom for one golden yolk--
2455,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Nay, on my word, sir, I mean no joke--"
2456,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Gold for gold is fair dealing, sir.'"
2457,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Think of the grocer gaping there!
2458,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2459,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Or the baker, if I went and said,"
2460,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"--'This tulip for a loaf of bread,"
2461,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),God's beauty for your kneaded grain;'
2462,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2463,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Or the vintner--'For this flower of mine
2464,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"A flagon, pray, of yellow wine,"
2465,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),And you shall keep the change for gain.'
2466,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2467,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Ah me, on what a different earth"
2468,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"I and these fellows had our birth,"
2469,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Strange that these golden things should be
2470,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"For them so poor, so rich for me.'"
2471,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2472,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Ended his sigh, the poet searched his shelf--"
2473,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Seeking another poet to feed himself;
2474,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Then sadly went, and, full of shame and grief,"
2475,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Sold his last Swinburne for a plate of beef.
2476,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),
2477,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),"Thus poets too, to fill the hungry maw,"
2478,(TO MRS. PERCY DEARMER),Must eat each other--'tis the eternal law.

2506,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Yea, it is best, dear friends, who have so oft"
2507,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Fed full my ears with praises sweet and soft,"
2508,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Sweeter and softer than my song should win,"
2509,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Too sweet and soft--I must not listen more,"
2510,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Lest its dear perilous honey make me mad,"
2511,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,And once again an overweening lad
2512,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Presume against Apollo. Nay, no more!"
2513,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"'Tis not to pipes like mine sing stars at morn,"
2514,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Nor stars at night dance in their solemn dance:
2515,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Nay, stars! why tell of stars? the very thrush"
2516,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Putteth my daintiest cunning to the blush
2517,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,And boasteth him the hedgerow laureate.
2518,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Yea, dimmest daisies lost amid the grass,"
2519,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"One might have deemed blessed us for looking at,"
2520,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Would rather choose,--yea, so it is, alas!--"
2521,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,The meanest bird that from its tiny throat
2522,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Droppeth the pearl of one monotonous note,"
2523,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Than any music I can bring to pass.
2524,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,
2525,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"So, let me go: for, while I linger here,"
2526,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Piping these dainty ditties for your ear,"
2527,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"To win that dearer honey for my own,"
2528,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Daylong my Thestylis doth sit alone,"
2529,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Weeping, mayhap, because the gods have given"
2530,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Song but not sheep--the rarer gift of heaven;
2531,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"And little Phyllis solitary grows,"
2532,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,And little Corydon unheeded goes.
2533,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,
2534,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Sheep are the shepherd's business,--let me go,--"
2535,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Piping his pastime when the sun is low:
2536,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"But I, alas! the other order keep,"
2537,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Piping my business, and forgot my sheep."
2538,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,
2539,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,My song that once was as a little sweet
2540,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Savouring the daily bread we all must eat,"
2541,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Lo! it has come to be my only food:
2542,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"And, as a lover of the Indian weed"
2543,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Steals to a self-indulgent solitude,"
2544,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"To draw the dreamy sweetness from its root,"
2545,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,So from the strong blithe world of valorous deed
2546,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,I steal away to suck this singing weed;
2547,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"And while the morning gathers up its strength,"
2548,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"And while the noonday runneth on in might,"
2549,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Until the shadows and the evening light
2550,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Come and awake me with a fear at length,"
2551,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Prone in some hankering covert hid away,"
2552,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Fain am I still my piping to prolong,"
2553,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,And for the largess of a bounteous day
2554,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Dare pay my maker with a paltry song.
2555,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,
2556,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Welcome the song that like a trumpet high
2557,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Lifts the tired head of battle with its cry,"
2558,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Welcome the song that from its morning heights
2559,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Cheers jaded markets with the health of fields,"
2560,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Brings down the stars to mock the city lights.
2561,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Or up to heaven a shining ladder builds.
2562,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"But not to me belongeth such a grace,"
2563,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"And, were it mine, 'tis not in amorous shade"
2564,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,To river music that such song is made:
2565,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,The song that moves the battle on awoke
2566,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"To the stern rhythm of the swordsman's stroke,"
2567,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,The song that fans the city's weary face
2568,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Sprang not afar from out some leafy place,"
2569,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,But bubbled spring-like in its dingiest lane
2570,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,From out a heart that shared the city's pain;
2571,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,And he who brings the stars into the street
2572,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"And builds that shining ladder for our feet,"
2573,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Dwells in no mystic Abora aloof,"
2574,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,But shares the shelter of the common roof;
2575,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"He learns great metres from the thunderous hum,"
2576,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,And all his songs pulse to the human beat.
2577,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,
2578,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"But I am Corydon, I am not he,"
2579,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,Though I no more that Corydon shall be
2580,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,To make a sugared comfit of my song.
2581,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"So now I go, go back to Thestylis--"
2582,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,How her poor eyes will laugh again for this!
2583,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Go back to Thestylis, and no more roam"
2584,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"In melancholy meadows mad to sing,"
2585,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,But teach our little home itself to sing.
2586,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"Yea, Corydon, now cast thy pipe away---"
2587,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"See, how it floats upon the stream, and see"
2588,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"There it has gone, and now--away! away!"
2589,CORYDON'S FAREWELL TO HIS PIPE,"But O! my pipe, how sweet thou wert to me!"
