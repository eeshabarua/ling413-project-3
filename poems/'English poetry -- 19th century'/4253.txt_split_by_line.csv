70,INTRODUCTION,INTRODUCTION
71,INTRODUCTION,
72,INTRODUCTION,"[The Dramatic Romances,...] enriched by some of the poems originally"
73,INTRODUCTION,"printed in Men and Women, and a few from Dramatic Lyrics as first"
74,INTRODUCTION,"printed, include some of Browning's finest and most characteristic work."
75,INTRODUCTION,In several of them the poet displays his familiarity with the life and
76,INTRODUCTION,spirit of the Renaissance--a period portrayed by him with a fidelity
77,INTRODUCTION,more real than history--for he enters into the feelings that give rise
78,INTRODUCTION,"to action, while the historian is busied only with the results growing"
79,INTRODUCTION,out of the moving force of feeling.
80,INTRODUCTION,
81,INTRODUCTION,The egotism of the Ferrara husband outraged at the gentle wife because
82,INTRODUCTION,"she is as gracious toward those who rendered her small courtesies,"
83,INTRODUCTION,and seemed as thankful to them as she was to him for his gift of a
84,INTRODUCTION,"nine-hundred-years-old name, opens up for inspection the heart of a"
85,INTRODUCTION,"husband at a time when men exercised complete control over their wives,"
86,INTRODUCTION,"and could satisfy their jealous, selfish instincts by any cruel methods"
87,INTRODUCTION,"they chose to adopt, with no one to say them ""nay."" The highly developed"
88,INTRODUCTION,artistic sense shown by this husband is not incompatible with his
89,INTRODUCTION,"consummate selfishness and cruelty, as many tales of that time might be"
90,INTRODUCTION,"brought forward to illustrate. The husband in ""The Statue and the Bust"""
91,INTRODUCTION,"belongs to the same type, and the situation there is the inevitable"
92,INTRODUCTION,outcome of a civilization in which women were not consulted as to whom
93,INTRODUCTION,"they would marry, and naturally often fell a prey to love if it should"
94,INTRODUCTION,come to them afterwards. Weakness of will in the case of the lovers in
95,INTRODUCTION,this poem wrecked their lives; for they were not strong enough to follow
96,INTRODUCTION,either duty or love. Another glimpse is caught of this period when
97,INTRODUCTION,husbands and brothers and fathers meted out what they considered justice
98,INTRODUCTION,"to the women in ""In a Gondola."" ""The Grammarian's Funeral"" gives also"
99,INTRODUCTION,an aspect of Renaissance life--the fervor for learning characteristic
100,INTRODUCTION,"of the earlier days of the Renaissance when devoted pedants, as Arthur"
101,INTRODUCTION,"Symons says in referring to this poem, broke ground in the restoration"
102,INTRODUCTION,to the modern world of the civilization and learning of ancient Greece
103,INTRODUCTION,"and Rome. Again, ""The Heretic's Tragedy"" and ""Holy-Cross Day"" picture"
104,INTRODUCTION,most vividly the methods resorted to by the dying church in its attempts
105,INTRODUCTION,to keep control of the souls of a humanity seething toward religious
106,INTRODUCTION,tolerance.
107,INTRODUCTION,
108,INTRODUCTION,"With only a small space at command, it is difficult to decide on the"
109,INTRODUCTION,"poems to be touched upon, especially where there is not one but would"
110,INTRODUCTION,"repay prolonged attention, due no less to the romantic interest of the"
111,INTRODUCTION,"stories, the marvellous penetration into human motives, the grasp of"
112,INTRODUCTION,"historical atmospheres, than to the originality and perfection of their"
113,INTRODUCTION,artistry.
114,INTRODUCTION,
115,INTRODUCTION,"A word must be said of ""The Flight of the Duchess"" and ""Childe Roland"
116,INTRODUCTION,"to the Dark Tower Came,"" both poems which have been productive of many"
117,INTRODUCTION,"commentaries, and both holding their own amid the bray [sic] of critics"
118,INTRODUCTION,as unique and beautiful specimens of poetic art. Certainly no two poems
119,INTRODUCTION,could be chosen to show wider diversity in the poet's genius than these.
120,INTRODUCTION,
121,INTRODUCTION,"The story told by the huntsman in ""The Flight of the Duchess"" is"
122,INTRODUCTION,"interesting enough simply as a story, but the telling of it is"
123,INTRODUCTION,"inimitable. One can see before him the devoted, kindly man,"
124,INTRODUCTION,"somewhat clumsy of speech, as indicated by the rough rhymes, and"
125,INTRODUCTION,characteristically drawing his illustrations from the calling he
126,INTRODUCTION,follows. Keen in his critical observation of the Duke and other members
127,INTRODUCTION,"of the household, he, nevertheless, has a tender appreciation of"
128,INTRODUCTION,the difficulties of the young Duchess in this unloving artificial
129,INTRODUCTION,environment.
130,INTRODUCTION,
131,INTRODUCTION,"When the Gypsy Queen sings her song through his memory of it, the rhymes"
132,INTRODUCTION,and rhythm take on a befitting harmoniousness and smoothness contrasting
133,INTRODUCTION,finely with the remainder of the poem.
134,INTRODUCTION,
135,INTRODUCTION,"By means of this song, moreover, the horizon is enlarged beyond the"
136,INTRODUCTION,"immediate ken of the huntsman. The race-instinct, which has so strong"
137,INTRODUCTION,"a hold upon the Gypsies, is exalted into a wondrous sort of love which"
138,INTRODUCTION,carries everything before it. This loving reality is also set over
139,INTRODUCTION,against the unloving artificiality of the first part of the poem. The
140,INTRODUCTION,"temptation is too strong for the love-starved little Duchess, and even"
141,INTRODUCTION,the huntsman and Jacinth come under her hypnotic spell.
142,INTRODUCTION,
143,INTRODUCTION,"Very different in effect is ""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came."" The"
144,INTRODUCTION,"one, rich in this lay of human emotion, couched in the simple language"
145,INTRODUCTION,"of reality; the other, a symbolic picture of the struggle and aspiration"
146,INTRODUCTION,of the soul. Interpreters have tried to pin this latter poem down to the
147,INTRODUCTION,"limits of an allegory, and find a specific meaning for every phrase"
148,INTRODUCTION,"and picture, but it has too much the quality of the modern symbolistic"
149,INTRODUCTION,writing to admit of any treatment so prosaic. In this respect it
150,INTRODUCTION,resembles music. Each mind will draw from it an interpretation suited to
151,INTRODUCTION,its own attitude and experiences. Reduced to the simplest possible lines
152,INTRODUCTION,"of interpretation, it symbolizes the inevitable fate which drives a"
153,INTRODUCTION,"truth-seeking soul to see the falsity of ideals once thought absolute,"
154,INTRODUCTION,yet in the face of the ruin of those ideals courage toward the
155,INTRODUCTION,continuance of aspiration is never for a moment lost.
156,INTRODUCTION,
157,INTRODUCTION,"As a bit of art, it is strikingly imaginative, and suggests the"
158,INTRODUCTION,"picture-quality of the tapestried horse, which Browning himself says was"
159,INTRODUCTION,the chief inspiration of the poem. It is a fine example of the way in
160,INTRODUCTION,"which the ""strange and winged"" fancy of the poet may take its flight"
161,INTRODUCTION,"from so simple an object as this tapestried horse, evidently a sorry"
162,INTRODUCTION,"beast too, in its needled presentment, or the poetic impulse would not"
163,INTRODUCTION,"have expressed itself in the vindictive, ""I never saw a horse [sic] I"
164,INTRODUCTION,"hated so."""

309,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Worked busily a day, and there she stands."
310,MY LAST DUCHESS,Will't please you sit and look at her? I said
311,MY LAST DUCHESS,"""Fra Pandolf"" by design, for never read"
312,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Strangers like you that pictured countenance,"
313,MY LAST DUCHESS,"The depth and passion of its earnest glance,"
314,MY LAST DUCHESS,But to myself they turned (since none puts by

316,MY LAST DUCHESS,"And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,"

318,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Are you to turn and ask thus.  Sir, 'twas not"
319,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Her husband's presence only, called that spot"

321,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Fra Pandolf chanced to say ""Her mantle laps"

323,MY LAST DUCHESS,Must never hope to reproduce the faint
324,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Half-flush that dies along her throat""; such stuff"
325,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough                    20"
326,MY LAST DUCHESS,For calling up that spot of joy. She had
327,MY LAST DUCHESS,"A heart--how shall I say--too soon made glad,"

329,MY LAST DUCHESS,"She looked on, and her looks went everywhere."
330,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Sir, 'twas all one! My favour at her breast,"

335,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Would draw from her alike the approving speech,                30"
336,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Or blush, at least. She thanked men--good! but thanked"

340,MY LAST DUCHESS,This sort of trifling?  Even had you skill
341,MY LAST DUCHESS,In speech (which I have not) to make your will
342,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Quite clear to such an one, and say, ""Just this"
343,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,"

346,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Her wits to yours, forsooth, and made excuse,"
347,MY LAST DUCHESS,E'en that would be some stooping; and I choose
348,MY LAST DUCHESS,"Never to stoop.  Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,"
349,MY LAST DUCHESS,Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without
350,MY LAST DUCHESS,Much the same smile?  This grew; I gave commands;
351,MY LAST DUCHESS,Then all smiles stopped together.  There she stands

1486,THE ITALIAN IN ENGLAND,"An hour, and she returned alone"

1623,NOTES:,"Alberta Nota, a writer of liberal principles, whom he"

1776,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Which, thick in one's track,"
1777,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Tempt the stranger to pick up and bite them,"
1778,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Tho' not yet half black!                              120
1779,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"How the old twisted olive trunks shudder,"
1780,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,The medlars let fall
1781,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Their hard fruit, and the brittle great fig-trees"
1782,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Snap off, figs and all,"
1783,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,For here comes the whole of the tempest!
1784,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"No refuge, but creep"
1785,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Back again to my side and my shoulder,"
1786,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And listen or sleep.
1787,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"O how will your country show next week,"
1788,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,When all the vine-boughs                              130
1789,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Have been stripped of their foliage to pasture
1790,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,The mules and the cows?
1791,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Last eve, I rode over the mountains,"
1792,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Your brother, my guide,"
1793,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Soon left me, to feast on the myrtles"
1794,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"That offered, each side,"
1795,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Their fruit-balls, black, glossy and luscious,--"
1796,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Or strip from the sorbs
1797,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"A treasure, or, rosy and wondrous,"

1799,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"But my mule picked his sure sober path out,"
1800,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Just stopping to neigh
1801,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,When he recognized down in the valley
1802,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,His mates on their way
1803,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,With the faggots and barrels of water;
1804,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And soon we emerged

1806,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And still as we urged
1807,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Our way, the woods wondered, and left us,"
1808,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,As up still we trudged                                150
1809,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Though the wild path grew wilder each instant,"
1810,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And place was e'en grudged
1811,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,'Mid the rock-chasms and piles of loose stones
1812,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Like the loose broken teeth
1813,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Of some monster which climbed there to die
1814,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,From the ocean beneath--
1815,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Place was grudged to the silver-grey fume-weed
1816,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"That clung to the path,"
1817,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And dark rosemary ever a-dying
1818,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"That, 'spite the wind's wrath,                        160"

1820,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And lentisks as staunch

1822,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And... what shows a branch
1823,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Coral-coloured, transparent, with circlets"
1824,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Of pale seagreen leaves;
1825,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Over all trod my mule with the caution
1826,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Of gleaners o'er sheaves,"
1827,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Still, foot after foot like a lad"
1828,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Till, round after round,                              170"
1829,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"He climbed to the top of Calvano,"
1830,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And God's own profound
1831,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Was above me, and round me the mountains,"
1832,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"And under, the sea,"

1841,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Still moving with you;
1842,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"For, ever some new head and breast of them"
1843,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Thrusts into view
1844,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,To observe the intruder; you see it
1845,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,If quickly you turn
1846,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"And, before they escape you surprise them."
1847,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,They grudge you should learn
1848,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"How the soft plains they look on, lean over"
1849,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And love (they pretend)                               190
1850,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"--Cower beneath them, the flat sea-pine crouches,"

1855,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,How fair! but a slave.
1856,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"So, I turned to the sea; and there slumbered"
1857,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,As greenly as ever
1858,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Those isles of the siren, your Galli;"

1866,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"From under the rock, her bold sister"
1867,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Swum halfway already.
1868,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Fortù, shall we sail there together"

1880,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Just a loop to admit the quick lizards;
1881,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Then, stand there and hear"
1882,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"The birds' quiet singing, that tells us"
1883,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"What life is, so clear?"
1884,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,--The secret they sang to Ulysses

1894,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Our tinker and smith,"

1908,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,At church for the show
1909,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Of the Sacrament, set forth this evening."

1911,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Of the Rosary's Virgin, by no means"
1912,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Of Virgins the least,"

1921,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,But the great masterpiece is the scaffold
1922,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Rigged glorious to hold
1923,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,All the fiddlers and fifers and drummers
1924,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"And trumpeters bold,"
1925,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Not afraid of Bellini nor Auber,"
1926,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,"Who, when the priest's hoarse,"
1927,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,Will strike us up something that's brisk
1928,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,For the feast's second course.
1929,THE ENGLISHMAN IN ITALY,And then will the flaxen-wigged Image

1962,NOTES:,more the noble woman who at the risk of her own life
1963,NOTES:,helped him to escape.  Though there is no exact historical
1964,NOTES:,"incident upon which this poem is founded, it has a"
1965,NOTES:,"historical background.  The Charles referred to (lines 8,"
1966,NOTES:,"11, 20, 116, 125) is Charles Albert, Prince of Carignano, of"
1967,NOTES:,the younger branch of the house of Savoy.  His having
1968,NOTES:,"played with the patriot in his youth, as the poem says, is"
1969,NOTES:,"quite possible, for Charles was brought up as a simple"
1970,NOTES:,"citizen in a public school, and one of his chief friends was"
1971,NOTES:,"Alberta Nota, a writer of liberal principles, whom he"
1972,NOTES:,"made his secretary.  As indicated in the poem, Charles"
1973,NOTES:,"at first declared himself in sympathy, though in a somewhat"
1974,NOTES:,"lukewarm manner, with the rising led by Santa Rosa against"
1975,NOTES:,"Austrian domination in 1823, and upon the abdication of"
1976,NOTES:,Victor Emanuel he became regent of Turin.  But when
1977,NOTES:,the king Charles Felix issued a denunciation against the
1978,NOTES:,"new government, Charles Albert succumbed to the king's"
1979,NOTES:,threats and left his friends in the lurch.  Later the Austrians
1980,NOTES:,"marched into the country, Santa Rosa was forced"
1981,NOTES:,"to retreat from Turin, and, with his friends, he who might"
1982,NOTES:,well have been the very patriot of the poem was obliged
1983,NOTES:,to fly from Italy.

2168,II,"Dip your arm o'er the boat-side, elbow-deep,"
2169,II,"As I do: thus: were death so unlike sleep,"
2170,II,"Caught this way? Death's to fear from flame or steel,"

2180,II,Row home? must we row home? Too surely

2184,II,"Door on door exactly waiting,"
2185,II,All's the set face of a child:                                130
2186,II,"But behind it, where's a trace"
2187,II,"Of the staidness and reserve,"
2188,II,"And formal lines without a curve,"
2189,II,In the same child's playing-face?
2190,II,No two windows look one way
2191,II,O'er the small sea-water thread
2192,II,"Below them.  Ah, the autumn day"
2193,II,"I, passing, saw you overhead!"
2194,II,"First, out a cloud of curtain blew,"
2195,II,"Then a sweet cry, and last came you--                         140"
2196,II,To catch your lory that must needs
2197,II,"Escape just then, of all times then,"
2198,II,"To peck a tall plant's fleecy seeds,"
2199,II,And make me happiest of men.
2200,II,I scarce could breathe to see you reach
2201,II,So far back o'er the balcony
2202,II,To catch him ere he climbed too high
2203,II,Above you in the Smyrna peach
2204,II,"That quick the round smooth cord of gold,"
2205,II,"This coiled hair on your head, unrolled,                      150"

2209,II,To let lie curling o'er their bosoms.
2210,II,"Dear lory, may his beak retain"
2211,II,Ever its delicate rose stain
2212,II,As if the wounded lotus-blossoms
2213,II,Had marked their thief to know again!
2214,II,

2216,II,Than mine! What should your chamber do?                       160
2217,II,--With all its rarities that ache
2218,II,"In silence while day lasts, but wake"
2219,II,"At night-time and their life renew,"
2220,II,Suspended just to pleasure you
2221,II,Who brought against their will together
2222,II,"These objects, and, while day lasts, weave"
2223,II,Around them such a magic tether
2224,II,"That dumb they look: your harp, believe,"
2225,II,With all the sensitive tight strings
2226,II,"Which dare not speak, now to itself                           170"
2227,II,"Breathes slumberously, as if some elf"
2228,II,"Went in and out the chords, his wings"
2229,II,"Make murmur wheresoe'er they graze,"
2230,II,"As an angel may, between the maze"
2231,II,"Of midnight palace-pillars, on"
2232,II,"And on, to sow God's plagues, have gone"
2233,II,Through guilty glorious Babylon.
2234,II,"And while such murmurs flow, the nymph"
2235,II,Bends o'er the harp-top from her shell
2236,II,As the dry limpet for the nymph                               180
2237,II,Come with a tune he knows so well.
2238,II,And how your statues' hearts must swell!
2239,II,And how your pictures must descend
2240,II,"To see each other, friend with friend!"

2662,NOTES:,distinguished as a poet and as a Colonial statesman and

2664,NOTES:,"Some verses of his in Blackwood's, 1837, attracted much"

2668,NOTES:,"thirty years, filling several important official positions."
2669,NOTES:,His unceremonious departure for New Zealand with no
2670,NOTES:,"leave-takings was the occasion of Browning's poem, which"

2672,NOTES:,"character.  His ""star"" did, however, rise again for his"
2673,NOTES:,"English friends, for he returned to London in 1871.  The"
2674,NOTES:,"year following saw the publication of his ""Ranolf and"
2675,NOTES:,"Amohia,"" a New Zealand poem, in the course of which"
2676,NOTES:,"he characterizes Browning as ""Subtlest Asserter of the"

3179,V,But lips where smiles went out and in;
3180,V,There was no guessing his kith and kin:
3181,V,And nobody could enough admire
3182,V,The tall man and his quaint attire.
3183,V,"Quoth one: ""It's as my great-grandsire,"

3192,VI,"All creatures living beneath the sun,"
3193,VI,"That creep or swim or fly or run,"
3194,VI,After me so as you never saw!
3195,VI,And I chiefly use my charm
3196,VI,"On creatures that do people harm,"
3197,VI,The mole and toad and newt and viper;
3198,VI,"And people call me the Pied Piper."""
3199,VI,(And here they noticed round his neck                          80
3200,VI,"A scarf of red and yellow stripe,"
3201,VI,To match with his coat of the self-same cheque

3203,VI,"And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying"
3204,VI,As if impatient to be playing

3220,VII,"Into the street the Piper stept,"
3221,VII,"Smiling first a little smile,"
3222,VII,As if he knew what magic slept                                100
3223,VII,In his quiet pipe the while;
3224,VII,"Then, like a musical adept"
3225,VII,"To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,"
3226,VII,And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled
3227,VII,Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;
3228,VII,"And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,"
3229,VII,You heard as if an army muttered;
3230,VII,And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
3231,VII,And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling;
3232,VII,And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.                 110
3233,VII,"Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,"
3234,VII,"Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,"
3235,VII,"Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,"
3236,VII,"Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,"
3237,VII,"Cocking tails and pricking whiskers,"
3238,VII,"Families by tens and dozens,"
3239,VII,"Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives--"
3240,VII,Followed the Piper for their lives.
3241,VII,"From street to street he piped advancing,"
3242,VII,"And step for step they followed dancing,                      120"
3243,VII,Until they came to the river Weser
3244,VII,Wherein all plunged and perished!
3245,VII,"--Save one who, stout as Julius Caesar,"
3246,VII,Swam across and lived to carry
3247,VII,"(As he, the manuscript he cherished)"
3248,VII,To Rat-land home his commentary:
3249,VII,"Which was, ""At the first shrill notes of the pipe,"
3250,VII,"I heard a sound as of scraping tripe,"
3251,VII,"And putting apples, wondrous ripe,"
3252,VII,Into a cider-press's gripe:                                   130
3253,VII,"And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards,"
3254,VII,"And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards,"
3255,VII,"And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks,"
3256,VII,And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks:
3257,VII,And it seemed as if a voice
3258,VII,(Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery
3259,VII,"Is breathed) called out, 'Oh rats, rejoice!"
3260,VII,The world is grown to one vast drysaltery!

3287,IX,And half the money would replenish
3288,IX,Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish.                     160

3355,XIII,"And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,"
3356,XIII,As the Piper turned from the High Street

3358,XIII,Right in the way of their sons and daughters!

3371,XIII,The door in the mountain-side shut fast.

3386,XIII,"And their dogs outran our fallow deer,"

3513,III,
3514,III,I was born the day this present Duke was--
3515,III,"(And O, says the song, ere I was old!)"
3516,III,In the castle where the other Duke was--
3517,III,"(When I was happy and young, not old!)"
3518,III,"I in the kennel, he in the bower:"
3519,III,We are of like age to an hour.
3520,III,My father was huntsman in that day;
3521,III,Who has not heard my father say
3522,III,"That, when a boar was brought to bay,                          40"
3523,III,"Three times, four times out of five,"

3525,III,"To get the killing-place transfixed,"
3526,III,"And pin him true, both eyes betwixt?"
3527,III,And that's why the old Duke would rather
3528,III,"He lost a salt-pit than my father,"
3529,III,And loved to have him ever in call;
3530,III,That's why my father stood in the hall
3531,III,When the old Duke brought his infant out
3532,III,"To show the people, and while they passed              50"
3533,III,"The wondrous bantling round about,"
3534,III,Was first to start at the outside blast

3559,III,Such a day as to-day in the merry sunshine!
3560,III,Had they stuck on his fist a rough-foot merlin!

3570,III,And ropy with sweet--we shall not quarrel.
3571,III,
3572,IV,IV
3573,IV,
3574,IV,"So, at home, the sick tall yellow Duchess"
3575,IV,"Was left with the infant in her clutches,                      90"
3576,IV,She being the daughter of God knows who:
3577,IV,And now was the time to revisit her tribe.
3578,IV,"Abroad and afar they went, the two,"
3579,IV,And let our people rail and gibe
3580,IV,"At the empty hall and extinguished fire,"
3581,IV,"As loud as we liked, but ever in vain,"
3582,IV,"Till after long years we had our desire,"
3583,IV,And back came the Duke and his mother again.
3584,IV,
3585,V,V
3586,V,
3587,V,And he came back the pertest little ape
3588,V,That ever affronted human shape;                              100
3589,V,"Full of his travel, struck at himself."
3590,V,"You'd say, he despised our bluff old ways?"
3591,V,--Not he! For in Paris they told the elf
3592,V,"Our rough North land was the Land of Lays,"
3593,V,The one good thing left in evil days;
3594,V,"Since the Mid-Age was the Heroic Time,"
3595,V,And only in wild nooks like ours
3596,V,"Could you taste of it yet as in its prime,"
3597,V,"And see true castles, with proper towers,"
3598,V,"Young-hearted women, old-minded men,                          110"
3599,V,And manners now as manners were then.
3600,V,"So, all that the old Dukes had been, without knowing it,"
3601,V,"This Duke would fain know he was, without being it;"
3602,V,"'Twas not for the joy's self, but the joy of his showing it,"
3603,V,"Nor for the pride's self, but the pride of our seeing it,"
3604,V,"He revived all usages thoroughly worn-out,"
3605,V,"The souls of them fumed-forth, the hearts of them torn-out:"
3606,V,And chief in the chase his neck he perilled
3607,V,"On a lathy horse, all legs and length,"
3608,V,"With blood for bone, all speed, no strength;                  120"
3609,V,--They should have set him on red Berold
3610,V,"With the red eye slow consuming in fire,"
3611,V,And the thin stiff ear like an abbey-spire!
3612,V,
3613,VI,VI
3614,VI,
3615,VI,"Well, such as he was, he must marry, we heard:"
3616,VI,"And out of a convent, at the word,"
3617,VI,"Came the lady, in time of spring."
3618,VI,"--Oh, old thoughts they cling, they cling!"
3619,VI,"That day, I know, with a dozen oaths"
3620,VI,I clad myself in thick hunting-clothes
3621,VI,Fit for the chase of urochs or buffle                         130
3622,VI,In winter-time when you need to muffle.
3623,VI,"But the Duke had a mind we should cut a figure,"
3624,VI,And so we saw the lady arrive:
3625,VI,"My friend, I have seen a white crane bigger!"
3626,VI,"She was the smallest lady alive,"
3627,VI,"Made in a piece of nature's madness,"
3628,VI,"Too small, almost, for the life and gladness"
3629,VI,"That over-filled her, as some hive"
3630,VI,Out of the bears' reach on the high trees
3631,VI,Is crowded with its safe merry bees:                          140
3632,VI,"In truth, she was not hard to please!"
3633,VI,"Up she looked, down she looked, round at the mead,"
3634,VI,"Straight at the castle, that's best indeed"
3635,VI,To look at from outside the walls:
3636,VI,"As for us, styled the ""serfs and thralls,"""
3637,VI,"She as much thanked me as if she had said it,"
3638,VI,"(With her eyes, do you understand?)"
3639,VI,Because I patted her horse while I led it;
3640,VI,"And Max, who rode on her other hand,"
3641,VI,"Said, no bird flew past but she inquired                      150"
3642,VI,"What its true name was, nor ever seemed tired--"
3643,VI,"If that was an eagle she saw hover,"
3644,VI,And the green and grey bird on the field was the plover.
3645,VI,When suddenly appeared the Duke:
3646,VI,"And as down she sprung, the small foot pointed"
3647,VI,"On to my hand,--as with a rebuke,"
3648,VI,"And as if his backbone were not jointed,"
3649,VI,The Duke stepped rather aside than forward
3650,VI,And welcomed her with his grandest smile;
3651,VI,"And, mind you, his mother all the while               160"
3652,VI,"Chilled in the rear, like a wind to Nor'ward;"
3653,VI,"And up, like a weary yawn, with its pullies"
3654,VI,"Went, in a shriek, the rusty portcullis;"
3655,VI,"And, like a glad sky the north-wind sullies,"
3656,VI,"The lady's face stopped its play,"
3657,VI,As if her first hair had grown grey;
3658,VI,For such things must begin some one day.
3659,VI,
3660,VII,VII
3661,VII,
3662,VII,In a day or two she was well again;
3663,VII,"As who should say, ""You labour in vain!"
3664,VII,"This is all a jest against God, who meant                     170"
3665,VII,"I should ever be, as I am, content"
3666,VII,"And glad in his sight; therefore, glad I will be."""
3667,VII,"So, smiling as at first went she."
3668,VII,
3669,VIII,VIII
3670,VIII,
3671,VIII,"She was active, stirring, all fire--"
3672,VIII,"Could not rest, could not tire--"
3673,VIII,To a stone she might have given life!
3674,VIII,"(I myself loved once, in my day)"
3675,VIII,"--For a shepherd's, miner's, huntsman's wife,"
3676,VIII,"(I had a wife, I know what I say)"
3677,VIII,Never in all the world such an one!                           180
3678,VIII,"And here was plenty to be done,"
3679,VIII,"And she that could do it, great or small,"
3680,VIII,She was to do nothing at all.
3681,VIII,"There was already this man in his post,"
3682,VIII,"This in his station, and that in his office,"
3683,VIII,"And the Duke's plan admitted a wife, at most,"
3684,VIII,"To meet his eye, with the other trophies,"
3685,VIII,"Now outside the hall, now in it,"
3686,VIII,"To sit thus, stand thus, see and be seen,"
3687,VIII,"At the proper place in the proper minute,                     190"
3688,VIII,And die away the life between.
3689,VIII,"And it was amusing enough, each infraction"
3690,VIII,Of rule--(but for after-sadness that came)
3691,VIII,To hear the consummate self-satisfaction
3692,VIII,With which the young Duke and the old dame
3693,VIII,"Would let her advise, and criticise,"
3694,VIII,"And, being a fool, instruct the wise,"
3695,VIII,"And, child-like, parcel out praise or blame:"
3696,VIII,"They bore it all in complacent guise,"
3697,VIII,"As though an artificer, after contriving                      200"
3698,VIII,"A wheel-work image as if it were living,"
3699,VIII,Should find with delight it could motion to strike him!
3700,VIII,"So found the Duke, and his mother like him:"
3701,VIII,The lady hardly got a rebuff--
3702,VIII,"That had not been contemptuous enough,"
3703,VIII,"With his cursed smirk, as he nodded applause,"
3704,VIII,And kept off the old mother-cat's claws.
3705,VIII,
3706,IX,IX
3707,IX,
3708,IX,"So, the little lady grew silent and thin,"
3709,IX,"Paling and ever paling,"
3710,IX,As the way is with a hid chagrin;                             210
3711,IX,"And the Duke perceived that she was ailing,"
3712,IX,"And said in his heart, ""'Tis done to spite me,"
3713,IX,"But I shall find in my power to right me!"""
3714,IX,"Don't swear, friend! The old one, many a year,"
3715,IX,"Is in hell, and the Duke's self... you shall hear."
3716,IX,
3717,X,X
3718,X,
3719,X,"Well, early in autumn, at first winter-warning,"
3720,X,"When the stag had to break with his foot, of a morning,"
3721,X,A drinking-hole out of the fresh tender ice
3722,X,"That covered the pond till the sun, in a trice,"
3723,X,"Loosening it, let out a ripple of gold,                       220"
3724,X,"And another and another, and faster and faster"
3725,X,"Till, dimpling to blindness, the wide water rolled:"
3726,X,Then it so chanced that the Duke our master
3727,X,"Asked himself what were the pleasures in season,"
3728,X,"And found, since the calendar bade him be hearty,"
3729,X,He should do the Middle Age no treason
3730,X,In resolving on a hunting-party.
3731,X,"Always provided, old books showed the way of it!"
3732,X,What meant old poets by their strictures?
3733,X,"And when old poets had said their say of it,                  230"
3734,X,How taught old painters in their pictures?
3735,X,"We must revert to the proper channels,"
3736,X,"Workings in tapestry, paintings on panels,"
3737,X,And gather up woodcraft's authentic traditions:
3738,X,"Here was food for our various ambitions,"
3739,X,"As on each case, exactly stated--"
3740,X,"To encourage your dog, now, the properest chirrup"
3741,X,Or best prayer to Saint Hubert on mounting your stirrup--
3742,X,We of the household took thought and debated.
3743,X,Blessed was he whose back ached with the jerkin               240
3744,X,His sire was wont to do forest-work in;
3745,X,"Blesseder he who nobly sunk ""ohs"""
3746,X,"And ""ahs"" while he tugged on his grandsire's trunk-hose;"
3747,X,"What signified hats if they had no rims on,"
3748,X,"Each slouching before and behind like the scallop,"
3749,X,"And able to serve at sea for a shallop,"
3750,X,Loaded with lacquer and looped with crimson?
3751,X,"So that the deer now, to make a short rhyme on't,"
3752,X,"What with our Venerers, Prickers and Verderers,       250"
3753,X,"Might hope for real hunters at length and not murderers,"
3754,X,"And oh the Duke's tailor, he had a hot time on't!"
3755,X,
3756,XI,XI
3757,XI,
3758,XI,Now you must know that when the first dizziness
3759,XI,"Of flap-hats and buff-coats and jack-boots subsided,"
3760,XI,"The Duke put this question, ""The Duke's part provided,"
3761,XI,"Had not the Duchess some share in the business?"""
3762,XI,For out of the mouth of two or three witnesses
3763,XI,Did he establish all fit-or-unfitnesses:
3764,XI,"And, after much laying of heads together,"
3765,XI,Somebody's cap got a notable feather
3766,XI,By the announcement with proper unction                       260
3767,XI,That he had discovered the lady's function;
3768,XI,"Since ancient authors gave this tenet,"
3769,XI,"""When horns wind a mort and the deer is at siege,"
3770,XI,"Let the dame of the castle prick forth on her jennet,"
3771,XI,And with water to wash the hands of her liege
3772,XI,"In a clean ewer with a fair toweling,"
3773,XI,"Let her preside at the disemboweling."""
3774,XI,"Now, my friend, if you had so little religion"
3775,XI,"As to catch a hawk, some falcon-lanner,"
3776,XI,And thrust her broad wings like a banner              270
3777,XI,Into a coop for a vulgar pigeon;
3778,XI,And if day by day and week by week
3779,XI,"You cut her claws, and sealed her eyes,"
3780,XI,"And clipped her wings, and tied her beak,"
3781,XI,Would it cause you any great surprise
3782,XI,"If, when you decided to give her an airing,"
3783,XI,You found she needed a little preparing?
3784,XI,"--I say, should you be such a curmudgeon,"
3785,XI,"If she clung to the perch, as to take it in dudgeon?"
3786,XI,"Yet when the Duke to his lady signified,                      280"
3787,XI,"Just a day before, as he judged most dignified,"
3788,XI,"In what a pleasure she was to participate,--"
3789,XI,"And, instead of leaping wide in flashes,"
3790,XI,"Her eyes just lifted their long lashes,"
3791,XI,"As if pressed by fatigue even he could not dissipate,"
3792,XI,"And duly acknowledged the Duke's fore-thought,"
3793,XI,"But spoke of her health, if her health were worth aught,"
3794,XI,"Of the weight by day and the watch by night,"
3795,XI,"And much wrong now that used to be right,"
3796,XI,"So, thanking him, declined the hunting--                      290"
3797,XI,Was conduct ever more affronting?
3798,XI,With all the ceremony settled--
3799,XI,"With the towel ready, and the sewer"
3800,XI,"Polishing up his oldest ewer,"
3801,XI,"And the jennet pitched upon, a piebald,"
3802,XI,"Black-barred, cream-coated and pink eye-balled--"
3803,XI,No wonder if the Duke was nettled!
3804,XI,"And when she persisted nevertheless,--"
3805,XI,"Well, I suppose here's the time to confess"
3806,XI,That there ran half round our lady's chamber                  300
3807,XI,A balcony none of the hardest to clamber;
3808,XI,"And that Jacynth the tire-woman, ready in waiting,"
3809,XI,
3810,XI,"Stayed in call outside, what need of relating?"
3811,XI,"And since Jacynth was like a June rose, why, a fervent"
3812,XI,Adorer of Jacynth of course was your servant;
3813,XI,"And if she had the habit to peep through the casement,"
3814,XI,How could I keep at any vast distance?
3815,XI,"And so, as I say, on the lady's persistence,"
3816,XI,"The Duke, dumb-stricken with amazement,"
3817,XI,"Stood for a while in a sultry smother,                        310"
3818,XI,"And then, with a smile that partook of the awful,"
3819,XI,Turned her over to his yellow mother
3820,XI,To learn what was held decorous and lawful;
3821,XI,"And the mother smelt blood with a cat-like instinct,"
3822,XI,As her cheek quick whitened thro' all its quince-tinct.
3823,XI,"Oh, but the lady heard the whole truth at once!"
3824,XI,"What meant she?--Who was she?--Her duty and station,"
3825,XI,"The wisdom of age and the folly of youth, at once,"
3826,XI,Its decent regard and its fitting relation--
3827,XI,"In brief, my friend, set all the devils in hell free          320"
3828,XI,And turn them out to carouse in a belfry
3829,XI,"And treat the priests to a fifty-part canon,"
3830,XI,And then you may guess how that tongue of hers ran on!
3831,XI,"Well, somehow or other it ended at last"
3832,XI,"And, licking her whiskers, out she passed;"
3833,XI,"And after her,--making (he hoped) a face"
3834,XI,"Like Emperor Nero or Sultan Saladin,"
3835,XI,Stalked the Duke's self with the austere grace
3836,XI,"Of ancient hero or modern paladin,"
3837,XI,From door to staircase--oh such a solemn                      330
3838,XI,Unbending of the vertebral column!
3839,XI,
3840,XII,XII
3841,XII,
3842,XII,"However, at sunrise our company mustered;"
3843,XII,"And here was the huntsman bidding unkennel,"
3844,XII,"And there 'neath his bonnet the pricker blustered,"
3845,XII,With feather dank as a bough of wet fennel;
3846,XII,For the court-yard walls were filled with fog
3847,XII,You might have cut as an axe chops a log--
3848,XII,Like so much wool for colour and bulkiness;
3849,XII,"And out rode the Duke in a perfect sulkiness,"
3850,XII,"Since, before breakfast, a man feels but queasily             340"
3851,XII,And a sinking at the lower abdomen
3852,XII,Begins the day with indifferent omen.
3853,XII,"And lo, as he looked around uneasily,"
3854,XII,The sun ploughed the fog up and drove it asunder
3855,XII,This way and that from the valley under;
3856,XII,"And, looking through the court-yard arch,"
3857,XII,"Down in the valley, what should meet him"
3858,XII,But a troop of Gipsies on their march?
3859,XII,No doubt with the annual gifts to greet him.
3860,XII,
3861,XIII,XIII
3862,XIII,
3863,XIII,"Now, in your land, Gipsies reach you, only                    350"
3864,XIII,After reaching all lands beside;
3865,XIII,"North they go, South they go, trooping or lonely"
3866,XIII,"And still, as they travel far and wide,"
3867,XIII,"Catch they and keep now a trace here, a trace there,"
3868,XIII,"That puts you in mind of a place here, a place there."
3869,XIII,"But with us, I believe they rise out of the ground,"
3870,XIII,"And nowhere else, I take it, are found"
3871,XIII,With the earth-tint yet so freshly embrowned:
3872,XIII,"Born, no doubt, like insects which breed on"
3873,XIII,The very fruit they are meant to feed on.                     360
3874,XIII,"For the earth-not a use to which they don't turn it,"
3875,XIII,"The ore that grows in the mountain's womb,"
3876,XIII,"Or the sand in the pits like a honeycomb,"
3877,XIII,"They sift and soften it, bake it and burn it--"
3878,XIII,"Whether they weld you, for instance, a snaffle"
3879,XIII,With side-bars never a brute can baffle;
3880,XIII,Or a lock that's a puzzle of wards within wards;
3881,XIII,"Or, if your colt's fore-foot inclines to curve inwards,"
3882,XIII,Horseshoes they hammer which turn on a swivel
3883,XIII,And won't allow the hoof to shrivel.                          370
3884,XIII,Then they cast bells like the shell of the winkle
3885,XIII,That keep a stout heart in the ram with their tinkle;
3886,XIII,But the sand-they pinch and pound it like otters;
3887,XIII,Commend me to Gipsy glass-makers and potters!
3888,XIII,"Glasses they'll blow you, crystal-clear,"
3889,XIII,"Where just a faint cloud of rose shall appear,"
3890,XIII,As if in pure water you dropped and let die
3891,XIII,A bruised black-blooded mulberry;
3892,XIII,"And that other sort, their crowning pride,"
3893,XIII,"With long white threads distinct inside,                      380"
3894,XIII,Like the lake-flower's fibrous roots which dangle
3895,XIII,"Loose such a length and never tangle,"
3896,XIII,"Where the bold sword-lily cuts the clear waters,"
3897,XIII,And the cup-lily couches with all the white daughters:
3898,XIII,"Such are the works they put their hand to,"
3899,XIII,The uses they turn and twist iron and sand to.
3900,XIII,"And these made the troop, which our Duke saw sally"
3901,XIII,"Toward his castle from out of the valley,"
3902,XIII,"Men and women, like new-hatched spiders,"
3903,XIII,Come out with the morning to greet our riders.                390
3904,XIII,"And up they wound till they reached the ditch,"
3905,XIII,"Whereat all stopped save one, a witch"
3906,XIII,"That I knew, as she hobbled from the group,"
3907,XIII,"By her gait directly and her stoop,"
3908,XIII,"I, whom Jacynth was used to importune"
3909,XIII,To let that same witch tell us our fortune.
3910,XIII,The oldest Gipsy then above ground;
3911,XIII,"And, sure as the autumn season came round,"
3912,XIII,"She paid us a visit for profit or pastime,"
3913,XIII,"And every time, as she swore, for the last time.              400"
3914,XIII,
3915,XIII,And presently she was seen to sidle
3916,XIII,"Up to the Duke till she touched his bridle,"
3917,XIII,So that the horse of a sudden reared up
3918,XIII,As under its nose the old witch peered up
3919,XIII,"With her worn-out eyes, or rather eye-holes"
3920,XIII,"Of no use now but to gather brine,"
3921,XIII,And began a kind of level whine
3922,XIII,Such as they used to sing to their viols
3923,XIII,When their ditties they go grinding
3924,XIII,Up and down with nobody minding                               410
3925,XIII,"And then, as of old, at the end of the humming"
3926,XIII,Her usual presents were forthcoming
3927,XIII,"--A dog-whistle blowing the fiercest of trebles,"
3928,XIII,(Just a sea-shore stone holding a dozen fine pebbles)
3929,XIII,Or a porcelain mouth-piece to screw on a pipe-end--
3930,XIII,And so she awaited her annual stipend.
3931,XIII,"But this time, the Duke would scarcely vouchsafe"
3932,XIII,A word in reply; and in vain she felt
3933,XIII,With twitching fingers at her belt
3934,XIII,"For the purse of sleek pine-martin pelt,              420"
3935,XIII,Ready to put what he gave in her pouch safe--
3936,XIII,"Till, either to quicken his apprehension,"
3937,XIII,"Or possibly with an after-intention,"
3938,XIII,"She was come, she said, to pay her duty"
3939,XIII,"To the new Duchess, the youthful beauty."
3940,XIII,"No sooner had she named his lady,"
3941,XIII,"Than a shine lit up the face so shady,"
3942,XIII,And its smirk returned with a novel meaning--
3943,XIII,"For it struck him, the babe just wanted weaning;"
3944,XIII,"If one gave her a taste of what life was and sorrow,          430"
3945,XIII,"She, foolish today, would be wiser tomorrow;"
3946,XIII,And who so fit a teacher of trouble
3947,XIII,As this sordid crone bent well-nigh double?
3948,XIII,"So, glancing at her wolf-skin vesture,"
3949,XIII,"(If such it was, for they grow so hirsute"
3950,XIII,That their own fleece serves for natural fur-suit)
3951,XIII,"He was contrasting, 'twas plain from his gesture,"
3952,XIII,The life of the lady so flower-like and delicate
3953,XIII,With the loathsome squalor of this helicat.
3954,XIII,"I, in brief, was the man the Duke beckoned                    440"
3955,XIII,"From out of the throng, and while I drew near"
3956,XIII,He told the crone-as I since have reckoned
3957,XIII,By the way he bent and spoke into her ear
3958,XIII,With circumspection and mystery--
3959,XIII,"The main of the lady's history,"
3960,XIII,Her frowardness and ingratitude:
3961,XIII,And for all the crone's submissive attitude
3962,XIII,"I could see round her mouth the loose plaits tightening,"
3963,XIII,And her brow with assenting intelligence brightening
3964,XIII,As though she engaged with hearty goodwill            450
3965,XIII,"Whatever he now might enjoin to fulfil,"
3966,XIII,And promised the lady a thorough frightening.
3967,XIII,
3968,XIII,"And so, just giving her a glimpse"
3969,XIII,"Of a purse, with the air of a man who imps"
3970,XIII,"The wing of the hawk that shall fetch the hernshaw,"
3971,XIII,He bade me take the Gipsy mother
3972,XIII,And set her telling some story or other
3973,XIII,"Of hill or dale, oak-wood or fernshaw,"
3974,XIII,To wile away a weary hour
3975,XIII,"For the lady left alone in her bower,                         460"
3976,XIII,Whose mind and body craved exertion
3977,XIII,And yet shrank from all better diversion.
3978,XIII,
3979,XIV,XIV
3980,XIV,
3981,XIV,"Then clapping heel to his horse, the mere curveter,"
3982,XIV,"Out rode the Duke, and after his hollo"
3983,XIV,"Horses and hounds swept, huntsman and servitor,"
3984,XIV,And back I turned and bade the crone follow.
3985,XIV,And what makes me confident what's to be told you
3986,XIV,"Had all along been of this crone's devising,"
3987,XIV,"Is, that, on looking round sharply, behold you,"
3988,XIV,There was a novelty quick as surprising:              470
3989,XIV,"For first, she had shot up a full head in stature,"
3990,XIV,"And her step kept pace with mine nor faltered,"
3991,XIV,"As if age had foregone its usurpature,"
3992,XIV,"And the ignoble mien was wholly altered,"
3993,XIV,"And the face looked quite of another nature,"
3994,XIV,"And the change reached too, whatever the change meant,"
3995,XIV,Her shaggy wolf-skin cloak's arrangement:
3996,XIV,"For where its tatters hung loose like sedges,"
3997,XIV,"Gold coins were glittering on the edges,"
3998,XIV,Like the band-roll strung with tomans                         480
3999,XIV,Which proves the veil a Persian woman's:
4000,XIV,"And under her brow, like a snail's horns newly"
4001,XIV,"Come out as after the rain he paces,"
4002,XIV,Two unmistakeable eye-points duly
4003,XIV,Live and aware looked out of their places.
4004,XIV,"So, we went and found Jacynth at the entry"
4005,XIV,Of the lady's chamber standing sentry;
4006,XIV,"I told the command and produced my companion,"
4007,XIV,"And Jacynth rejoiced to admit any one,"
4008,XIV,"For since last night, by the same token,                      490"
4009,XIV,Not a single word had the lady spoken:
4010,XIV,"They went in both to the presence together,"
4011,XIV,While I in the balcony watched the weather.
4012,XIV,
4013,XV,XV
4014,XV,
4015,XV,"And now, what took place at the very first of all,"
4016,XV,"I cannot tell, as I never could learn it:"
4017,XV,Jacynth constantly wished a curse to fall
4018,XV,On that little head of hers and burn it
4019,XV,If she knew how she came to drop so soundly
4020,XV,Asleep of a sudden and there continue
4021,XV,The whole time sleeping as profoundly                         500
4022,XV,As one of the boars my father would pin you
4023,XV,"'Twixt the eyes where life holds garrison,"
4024,XV,--Jacynth forgive me the comparison!
4025,XV,But where I begin my own narration
4026,XV,Is a little after I took my station
4027,XV,"To breathe the fresh air from the balcony,"
4028,XV,"And, having in those days a falcon eye,"
4029,XV,"To follow the hunt thro' the open country,"
4030,XV,From where the bushes thinlier crested
4031,XV,"The hillocks, to a plain where's not one tree.                510"
4032,XV,"When, in a moment, my ear was arrested"
4033,XV,"By--was it singing, or was it saying,"
4034,XV,Or a strange musical instrument playing
4035,XV,In the chamber?--and to be certain
4036,XV,"I pushed the lattice, pulled the curtain,"
4037,XV,"And there lay Jacynth asleep,"
4038,XV,"Yet as if a watch she tried to keep,"
4039,XV,In a rosy sleep along the floor
4040,XV,With her head against the door;
4041,XV,"While in the midst, on the seat of state,                     520"
4042,XV,"Was a queen-the Gipsy woman late,"
4043,XV,With head and face downbent
4044,XV,On the lady's head and face intent:
4045,XV,"For, coiled at her feet like a child at ease,"
4046,XV,The lady sat between her knees
4047,XV,"And o'er them the lady's clasped hands met,"
4048,XV,"And on those hands her chin was set,"
4049,XV,And her upturned face met the face of the crone
4050,XV,Wherein the eyes had grown and grown
4051,XV,As if she could double and quadruple                          530
4052,XV,At pleasure the play of either pupil
4053,XV,"--Very like, by her hands' slow fanning,"
4054,XV,As up and down like a gor-crow's flappers
4055,XV,"They moved to measure, or bell-clappers."
4056,XV,"I said, ""Is it blessing, is it banning,"
4057,XV,Do they applaud you or burlesque you--
4058,XV,"Those hands and fingers with no flesh on?"""
4059,XV,"But, just as I thought to spring in to the rescue,"
4060,XV,At once I was stopped by the lady's expression:
4061,XV,For it was life her eyes were drinking                        540
4062,XV,"From the crone's wide pair above unwinking,"
4063,XV,"--Life's pure fire received without shrinking,"
4064,XV,Into the heart and breast whose heaving
4065,XV,"Told you no single drop they were leaving,"
4066,XV,"--Life, that filling her, passed redundant"
4067,XV,"Into her very hair, back swerving"
4068,XV,"Over each shoulder, loose and abundant,"
4069,XV,As her head thrown back showed the white throat curving;
4070,XV,"And the very tresses shared in the pleasure,"
4071,XV,"Moving to the mystic measure,                                 550"
4072,XV,Bounding as the bosom bounded.
4073,XV,"I stopped short, more and more confounded,"
4074,XV,"As still her cheeks burned and eyes glistened,"
4075,XV,As she listened and she listened:
4076,XV,"When all at once a hand detained me,"
4077,XV,"The selfsame contagion gained me,"
4078,XV,"And I kept time to the wondrous chime,"
4079,XV,"Making out words and prose and rhyme,"
4080,XV,Till it seemed that the music furled
4081,XV,"Its wings like a task fulfilled, and dropped          560"
4082,XV,"From under the words it first had propped,"
4083,XV,And left them midway in the world:
4084,XV,Word took word as hand takes hand
4085,XV,"I could hear at last, and understand,"
4086,XV,"And when I held the unbroken thread,"
4087,XV,The Gipsy said:
4088,XV,"""And so at last we find my tribe."
4089,XV,"And so I set thee in the midst,"
4090,XV,And to one and all of them describe
4091,XV,"What thou saidst and what thou didst,                 570"
4092,XV,"Our long and terrible journey through,"
4093,XV,And all thou art ready to say and do
4094,XV,In the trials that remain:
4095,XV,I trace them the vein and the other vein
4096,XV,"That meet on thy brow and part again,"
4097,XV,Making our rapid mystic mark;
4098,XV,And I bid my people prove and probe
4099,XV,Each eye's profound and glorious globe
4100,XV,Till they detect the kindred spark
4101,XV,"In those depths so dear and dark,                             580"
4102,XV,"Like the spots that snap and burst and flee,"
4103,XV,Circling over the midnight sea.
4104,XV,And on that round young cheek of thine
4105,XV,"I make them recognize the tinge,"
4106,XV,As when of the costly scarlet wine
4107,XV,They drip so much as will impinge
4108,XV,And spread in a thinnest scale afloat
4109,XV,One thick gold drop from the olive's coat
4110,XV,Over a silver plate whose sheen
4111,XV,Still thro' the mixture shall be seen.                        590
4112,XV,"For so I prove thee, to one and all,"
4113,XV,"Fit, when my people ope their breast,"
4114,XV,"To see the sign, and hear the call,"
4115,XV,"And take the vow, and stand the test"
4116,XV,Which adds one more child to the rest--
4117,XV,"When the breast is bare and the arms are wide,"
4118,XV,And the world is left outside.
4119,XV,
4120,XV,"For there is probation to decree,"
4121,XV,And many and long must the trials be
4122,XV,"Thou shalt victoriously endure,                               600"
4123,XV,If that brow is true and those eyes are sure;
4124,XV,Like a jewel-finder's fierce assay
4125,XV,Of the prize he dug from its mountain tomb--
4126,XV,Let once the vindicating ray
4127,XV,"Leap out amid the anxious gloom,"
4128,XV,And steel and fire have done their part
4129,XV,And the prize falls on its finder's heart;
4130,XV,"So, trial after trial past,"
4131,XV,Wilt thou fall at the very last
4132,XV,"Breathless, half in trance                                    610"
4133,XV,"With the thrill of the great deliverance,"
4134,XV,Into our arms for evermore;
4135,XV,"And thou shalt know, those arms once curled"
4136,XV,"About thee, what we knew before,"
4137,XV,How love is the only good in the world.
4138,XV,"Henceforth be loved as heart can love,"
4139,XV,"Or brain devise, or hand approve!"
4140,XV,"Stand up, look below,"
4141,XV,It is our life at thy feet we throw
4142,XV,To step with into light and joy;                              620
4143,XV,Not a power of life but we employ
4144,XV,To satisfy thy nature's want;
4145,XV,"Art thou the tree that props the plant,"
4146,XV,Or the climbing plant that seeks the tree--
4147,XV,"Canst thou help us, must we help thee?"
4148,XV,"If any two creatures grew into one,"
4149,XV,They would do more than the world has done:
4150,XV,"Though each apart were never so weak,"
4151,XV,Ye vainly through the world should seek
4152,XV,For the knowledge and the might                               630
4153,XV,Which in such union grew their right:
4154,XV,"So, to approach at least that end,"
4155,XV,"And blend,--as much as may be, blend"
4156,XV,Thee with us or us with thee--
4157,XV,"As climbing plant or propping tree,"
4158,XV,"Shall some one deck thee, over and down,"
4159,XV,"Up and about, with blossoms and leaves?"
4160,XV,"Fix his heart's fruit for thy garland-crown,"
4161,XV,"Cling with his soul as the gourd-vine cleaves,"
4162,XV,Die on thy boughs and disappear                               640
4163,XV,While not a leaf of thine is sere?
4164,XV,"Or is the other fate in store,"
4165,XV,"And art thou fitted to adore,"
4166,XV,"To give thy wondrous self away,"
4167,XV,And take a stronger nature's sway?
4168,XV,I foresee and could foretell
4169,XV,"Thy future portion, sure and well:"
4170,XV,"But those passionate eyes speak true, speak true,"
4171,XV,Let them say what thou shalt do!
4172,XV,"Only be sure thy daily life,                                  650"
4173,XV,"In its peace or in its strife,"
4174,XV,Never shall be unobserved;
4175,XV,"We pursue thy whole career,"
4176,XV,"And hope for it, or doubt, or fear--"
4177,XV,"Lo, hast thou kept thy path or swerved,"
4178,XV,"We are beside thee in all thy ways,"
4179,XV,"With our blame, with our praise,"
4180,XV,"Our shame to feel, our pride to show,"
4181,XV,"Glad, angry--but indifferent, no!"
4182,XV,"Whether it be thy lot to go,                                  660"
4183,XV,"For the good of us all, where the haters meet"
4184,XV,In the crowded city's horrible street;
4185,XV,Or thou step alone through the morass
4186,XV,Where never sound yet was
4187,XV,"Save the dry quick clap of the stork's bill,"
4188,XV,"For the air is still, and the water still,"
4189,XV,When the blue breast of the dipping coot
4190,XV,"Dives under, and all is mute."
4191,XV,"So, at the last shall come old age,"
4192,XV,Decrepit as befits that stage;                                670
4193,XV,How else wouldst thou retire apart
4194,XV,"With the hoarded memories of thy heart,"
4195,XV,And gather all to the very least
4196,XV,"Of the fragments of life's earlier feast,"
4197,XV,Let fall through eagerness to find
4198,XV,The crowning dainties yet behind?
4199,XV,Ponder on the entire past
4200,XV,"Laid together thus at last,"
4201,XV,When the twilight helps to fuse
4202,XV,"The first fresh with the faded hues,                          680"
4203,XV,"And the outline of the whole,"
4204,XV,"As round eve's shades their framework roll,"
4205,XV,Grandly fronts for once thy soul.
4206,XV,"And then as, 'mid the dark, a gleam"
4207,XV,"Of yet another morning breaks,"
4208,XV,"And like the hand which ends a dream,"
4209,XV,"Death, with the might of his sunbeam,"
4210,XV,"Touches the flesh and the soul awakes,"
4211,XV,"Then--"""
4212,XV,"Ay, then indeed something would happen!"
4213,XV,But what? For here her voice changed like a bird's;   690
4214,XV,There grew more of the music and less of the words;
4215,XV,Had Jacynth only been by me to clap pen
4216,XV,To paper and put you down every syllable
4217,XV,"With those clever clerkly fingers,"
4218,XV,All I've forgotten as well as what lingers
4219,XV,In this old brain of mine that's but ill able
4220,XV,To give you even this poor version
4221,XV,"Of the speech I spoil, as it were, with stammering"
4222,XV,--More fault of those who had the hammering
4223,XV,Of prosody into me and syntax                         700
4224,XV,"And did it, not with hobnails but tintacks!"
4225,XV,
4226,XV,But to return from this excursion--
4227,XV,"Just, do you mark, when the song was sweetest,"
4228,XV,"The peace most deep and the charm completest,"
4229,XV,"There came, shall I say, a snap--"
4230,XV,And the charm vanished!
4231,XV,"And my sense returned, so strangely banished,"
4232,XV,"And, starting as from a nap,"
4233,XV,"I knew the crone was bewitching my lady,"
4234,XV,With Jacynth asleep; and but one spring made I                710
4235,XV,"Down from the casement, round to the portal,"
4236,XV,Another minute and I had entered--
4237,XV,"When the door opened, and more than mortal"
4238,XV,"Stood, with a face where to my mind centred"
4239,XV,"All beauties I ever saw or shall see,"
4240,XV,The Duchess: I stopped as if struck by palsy.
4241,XV,"She was so different, happy and beautiful,"
4242,XV,"I felt at once that all was best,"
4243,XV,"And that I had nothing to do, for the rest"
4244,XV,"But wait her commands, obey and be dutiful.                   720"
4245,XV,"Not that, in fact, there was any commanding;"
4246,XV,"I saw the glory of her eye,"
4247,XV,"And the brow's height and the breast's expanding,"
4248,XV,And I was hers to live or to die.
4249,XV,"As for finding what she wanted,"
4250,XV,You know God Almighty granted
4251,XV,Such little signs should serve wild creatures
4252,XV,"To tell one another all their desires,"
4253,XV,"So that each knows what his friend requires,"
4254,XV,And does its bidding without teachers.                        730
4255,XV,I preceded her; the crone
4256,XV,Followed silent and alone;
4257,XV,"I spoke to her, but she merely jabbered"
4258,XV,In the old style; both her eyes had slunk
4259,XV,Back to their pits; her stature shrunk;
4260,XV,"In short, the soul in its body sunk"
4261,XV,Like a blade sent home to its scabbard.
4262,XV,"We descended, I preceding;"
4263,XV,Crossed the court with nobody heeding;
4264,XV,"All the world was at the chase,                               740"
4265,XV,"The courtyard like a desert-place,"
4266,XV,The stable emptied of its small fry;
4267,XV,I saddled myself the very palfrey
4268,XV,"I remember patting while it carried her,"
4269,XV,The day she arrived and the Duke married her.
4270,XV,"And, do you know, though it's easy deceiving"
4271,XV,"Oneself in such matters, I can't help believing"
4272,XV,"The lady had not forgotten it either,"
4273,XV,And knew the poor devil so much beneath her
4274,XV,Would have been only too glad for her service                 750
4275,XV,"To dance on hot ploughshares like a Turk dervise,"
4276,XV,"But, unable to pay proper duty where owing"
4277,XV,Was reduced to that pitiful method of showing it:
4278,XV,For though the moment I began setting
4279,XV,"His saddle on my own nag of Berold's begetting,"
4280,XV,(Not that I meant to be obtrusive)
4281,XV,"She stopped me, while his rug was shifting,"
4282,XV,"By a single rapid finger's lifting,"
4283,XV,"And, with a gesture kind but conclusive,"
4284,XV,"And a little shake of the head, refused me--                  760"
4285,XV,"I say, although she never used me,"
4286,XV,"Yet when she was mounted, the Gipsy behind her,"
4287,XV,And I ventured to remind her
4288,XV,I suppose with a voice of less steadiness
4289,XV,"Than usual, for my feeling exceeded me,"
4290,XV,--Something to the effect that I was in readiness
4291,XV,Whenever God should please she needed me--
4292,XV,"Then, do you know, her face looked down on me"
4293,XV,"With a look that placed a crown on me,"
4294,XV,"And she felt in her bosom--mark, her bosom--                  770"
4295,XV,"And, as a flower-tree drops its blossom,"
4296,XV,"Dropped me... ah, had it been a purse"
4297,XV,"Of silver, my friend, or gold that's worse,"
4298,XV,"Why, you see, as soon as I found myself"
4299,XV,"So understood,--that a true heart so may gain"
4300,XV,"Such a reward,--I should have gone home again,"
4301,XV,"Kissed Jacynth, and soberly drowned myself!"
4302,XV,It was a little plait of hair
4303,XV,Such as friends in a convent make
4304,XV,"To wear, each for the other's sake--                  780"
4305,XV,"This, see, which at my breast I wear,"
4306,XV,"Ever did (rather to Jacynth's grudgment),"
4307,XV,"And ever shall, till the Day of Judgment."
4308,XV,"And then-and then--to cut short--this is idle,"
4309,XV,These are feelings it is not good to foster--
4310,XV,"I pushed the gate wide, she shook the bridle,"
4311,XV,And the palfrey bounded--and so we lost her.
4312,XV,
4313,XVI,XVI
4314,XVI,
4315,XVI,When the liquor's out why clink the cannikin?
4316,XVI,I did think to describe you the panic in
4317,XVI,"The redoubtable breast of our master the mannikin,            790"
4318,XVI,"And what was the pitch of his mother's yellowness,"
4319,XVI,How she turned as a shark to snap the spare-rib
4320,XVI,"Clean off, sailors say, from a pearl-diving Carib,"
4321,XVI,"When she heard, what she called the flight of the feloness"
4322,XVI,"--But it seems such child's play,"
4323,XVI,What they said and did with the lady away!
4324,XVI,"And to dance on, when we've lost the music,"
4325,XVI,Always made me--and no doubt makes you--sick.
4326,XVI,"Nay, to my mind, the world's face looked so stern"
4327,XVI,"As that sweet form disappeared through the postern,           800"
4328,XVI,"She that kept it in constant good humour,"
4329,XVI,It ought to have stopped; there seemed nothing to do more.
4330,XVI,"But the world thought otherwise and went on,"
4331,XVI,And my head's one that its spite was spent on:
4332,XVI,"Thirty years are fled since that morning,"
4333,XVI,And with them all my head's adorning.
4334,XVI,"Nor did the old Duchess die outright,"
4335,XVI,"As you expect, of suppressed spite,"
4336,XVI,The natural end of every adder
4337,XVI,Not suffered to empty its poison-bladder:                     810
4338,XVI,"But she and her son agreed, I take it,"
4339,XVI,"That no one should touch on the story to wake it,"
4340,XVI,"For the wound in the Duke's pride rankled fiery,"
4341,XVI,"So, they made no search and small inquiry--"
4342,XVI,"And when fresh Gipsies have paid us a visit, I've"
4343,XVI,"Notice the couple were never inquisitive,"
4344,XVI,"But told them they're folks the Duke don't want here,"
4345,XVI,And bade them make haste and cross the frontier.
4346,XVI,"Brief, the Duchess was gone and the Duke was glad of it,"
4347,XVI,"And the old one was in the young one's stead,         820"
4348,XVI,"And took, in her place, the household's head,"
4349,XVI,And a blessed time the household had of it!
4350,XVI,"And were I not, as a man may say, cautious"
4351,XVI,"How I trench, more than needs, on the nauseous,"
4352,XVI,I could favour you with sundry touches
4353,XVI,Of the paint-smutches with which the Duchess
4354,XVI,Heightened the mellowness of her cheek's yellowness
4355,XVI,(To get on faster) until at last her
4356,XVI,Cheek grew to be one master-plaster
4357,XVI,Of mucus and fucus from mere use of ceruse:                   830
4358,XVI,"In short, she grew from scalp to udder"
4359,XVI,Just the object to make you shudder.
4360,XVI,
4361,XVII,XVII
4362,XVII,
4363,XVII,You're my friend--
4364,XVII,"What a thing friendship is, world without end!"
4365,XVII,How it gives the heart and soul a stir-up
4366,XVII,"As if somebody broached you a glorious runlet,"
4367,XVII,"And poured out, all lovelily, sparklingly, sunlit,"
4368,XVII,"Our green Moldavia, the streaky syrup,"
4369,XVII,Cotnar as old as the time of the Druids--
4370,XVII,Friendship may match with that monarch of fluids;             840
4371,XVII,"Each supples a dry brain, fills you its ins-and-outs,"
4372,XVII,Gives your life's hour-glass a shake when the thin sand doubts
4373,XVII,"Whether to run on or stop short, and guarantees"
4374,XVII,Age is not all made of stark sloth and arrant ease.
4375,XVII,"I have seen my little lady once more,"
4376,XVII,"Jacynth, the Gipsy, Berold, and the rest of it,"
4377,XVII,"For to me spoke the Duke, as I told you before;"
4378,XVII,I always wanted to make a clean breast of it:
4379,XVII,"And now it is made-why, my heart's blood, that went trickle,"
4380,XVII,"Trickle, but anon, in such muddy driblets,            850"
4381,XVII,"Is pumped up brisk now, through the main ventricle,"
4382,XVII,And genially floats me about the giblets.
4383,XVII,
4384,XVII,I'll tell you what I intend to do:
4385,XVII,I must see this fellow his sad life through--
4386,XVII,"He is our Duke, after all,"
4387,XVII,"And I, as he says, but a serf and thrall."
4388,XVII,"My father was born here, and I inherit"
4389,XVII,"His fame, a chain he bound his son with;"
4390,XVII,"Could I pay in a lump I should prefer it,"
4391,XVII,But there's no mine to blow up and get done with:     860
4392,XVII,"So, I must stay till the end of the chapter."
4393,XVII,"For, as to our middle-age-manners-adapter,"
4394,XVII,"Be it a thing to be glad on or sorry on,"
4395,XVII,"Some day or other, his head in a morion"
4396,XVII,"And breast in a hauberk, his heels he'll kick up,"
4397,XVII,Slain by an onslaught fierce of hiccup.
4398,XVII,"And then, when red doth the sword of our Duke rust,"
4399,XVII,"And its leathern sheath lie o'ergrown with a blue crust,"
4400,XVII,Then I shall scrape together my earnings;
4401,XVII,"For, you see, in the churchyard Jacynth reposes,      870"
4402,XVII,And our children all went the way of the roses:
4403,XVII,It's a long lane that knows no turnings.
4404,XVII,One needs but little tackle to travel in;
4405,XVII,"So, just one stout cloak shall I indue:"
4406,XVII,"And for a staff, what beats the javelin"
4407,XVII,With which his boars my father pinned you?
4408,XVII,"And then, for a purpose you shall hear presently,"
4409,XVII,"Taking some Cotnar, a tight plump skinful,"
4410,XVII,"I shall go journeying, who but I, pleasantly!"
4411,XVII,Sorrow is vain and despondency sinful.                880
4412,XVII,"What's a man's age? He must hurry more, that's all;"
4413,XVII,"Cram in a day, what his youth took a year to hold:"
4414,XVII,"When we mind labour, then only, we're too old--"
4415,XVII,What age had Methusalem when he begat Saul?
4416,XVII,"And at last, as its haven some buffeted ship sees,"
4417,XVII,(Come all the way from the north-parts with sperm oil)
4418,XVII,I hope to get safely out of the turmoil
4419,XVII,"And arrive one day at the land of the Gipsies,"
4420,XVII,"And find my lady, or hear the last news of her"
4421,XVII,"From some old thief and son of Lucifer,                       890"
4422,XVII,"His forehead chapleted green with wreathy hop,"
4423,XVII,Sunburned all over like an AEthiop.
4424,XVII,And when my Cotnar begins to operate
4425,XVII,"And the tongue of the rogue to run at a proper rate,"
4426,XVII,"And our wine-skin, tight once, shows each flaccid dent,"
4427,XVII,I shall drop in with--as if by accident--
4428,XVII,"""You never knew, then, how it all ended,"
4429,XVII,What fortune good or bad attended
4430,XVII,"The little lady your Queen befriended?"""
4431,XVII,"--And when that's told me, what's remaining?                  900"
4432,XVII,This world's too hard for my explaining.
4433,XVII,The same wise judge of matters equine
4434,XVII,Who still preferred some slim four-year-old
4435,XVII,To the big-boned stock of mighty Berold
4436,XVII,"And, for strong Cotnar, drank French weak wine,"
4437,XVII,He also must be such a lady's scorner!
4438,XVII,Smooth Jacob still robs homely Esau:
4439,XVII,"Now up, now down, the world's one see-saw."
4440,XVII,"--So, I shall find out some snug corner"
4441,XVII,"Under a hedge, like Orson the wood-knight,                    910"
4442,XVII,Turn myself round and bid the world good night;
4443,XVII,And sleep a sound sleep till the trumpet blowing
4444,XVII,Wakes me (unless priests cheat us laymen)
4445,XVII,To a world where will be no further throwing
4446,XVII,Pearls before swine that can't value them.  Amen!

5726,III,So much as gladness that some end might be.
5727,III,
5728,IV,IV
5729,IV,
5730,IV,"For, what with my whole world-wide wandering,"
5731,IV,"What with my search drawn out thro' years, my hope     20"
5732,IV,Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope
5733,IV,"With that obstreperous joy success would bring,"
5734,IV,I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring
5735,IV,"My heart made, finding failure in its scope."
5736,IV,
5737,V,V
5738,V,
5739,V,As when a sick man very near to death
5740,V,"Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end"
5741,V,"The tears and takes the farewell of each friend,"
5742,V,"And hears one bid the other go, draw breath"
5743,V,"Freelier outside (""since all is o'er,"" he saith,"
5744,V,"""And the blow fallen no grieving can amend"");          30"
5745,V,
5746,VI,VI
5747,VI,
5748,VI,While some discuss if near the other graves
5749,VI,"Be room enough for this, and when a day"
5750,VI,"Suits best for carrying the corpse away,"
5751,VI,"With care about the banners, scarves and staves:"
5752,VI,"And still the man hears all, and only craves"
5753,VI,He may not shame such tender love and stay.
5754,VI,
5755,VII,VII
5756,VII,
5757,VII,"Thus, I had so long suffered in this quest,"
5758,VII,"Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ"
5759,VII,"So many times among ""The Band""--to wit,"
5760,VII,The knights who to the Dark Tower's search addressed           40
5761,VII,"Their steps--that just to fail as they, seemed best,"
5762,VII,And all the doubt was now--should I be fit?
5763,VII,
5764,VIII,VIII
5765,VIII,
5766,VIII,"So, quiet as despair, I turned from him,"
5767,VIII,"That hateful cripple, out of his highway"
5768,VIII,Into the path he pointed.  All the day
5769,VIII,"Had been a dreary one at best, and dim"
5770,VIII,"Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim"
5771,VIII,Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.
5772,VIII,
5773,IX,IX
5774,IX,
5775,IX,For mark! no sooner was I fairly found
5776,IX,"Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,             50"
5777,IX,"Than, pausing to throw backward a last view"
5778,IX,"O'er the safe road, 'twas gone; grey plain all round:"
5779,IX,Nothing but plain to the horizon's bound.
5780,IX,I might go on; nought else remained to do.
5781,IX,
5782,X,X
5783,X,
5784,X,"So, on I went.  I think I never saw"
5785,X,Such starved ignoble nature; nothing throve:
5786,X,For flowers-as well expect a cedar grove!
5787,X,"But cockle, spurge, according to their law"
5788,X,"Might propagate their kind, with none to awe,"
5789,X,You'd think; a burr had been a treasure trove.         60
5790,X,
5791,XI,XI
5792,XI,
5793,XI,"No! penury, inertness and grimace,"
5794,XI,"In some strange sort, were the land's portion.  ""See"
5795,XI,"Or shut your eyes,"" said Nature peevishly,"
5796,XI,"""It nothing skills: I cannot help my case:"
5797,XI,"'Tis the Last Judgment's fire must cure this place,"
5798,XI,"Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free."""
5799,XI,
5800,XII,XII
5801,XII,
5802,XII,If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk
5803,XII,"Above its mates, the head was chopped; the bents"
5804,XII,Were jealous else.  What made those holes and rents
5805,XII,"In the dock's harsh swarth leaves, bruised as to baulk         70"
5806,XII,All hope of greenness? 'tis a brute must walk
5807,XII,"Pashing their life out, with a brute's intents."
5808,XII,
5809,XIII,XIII
5810,XIII,
5811,XIII,"As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair"
5812,XIII,In leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud
5813,XIII,Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood.
5814,XIII,"One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,"
5815,XIII,"Stood stupefied, however he came there:"
5816,XIII,Thrust out past service from the devil's stud!
5817,XIII,
5818,XIV,XIV
5819,XIV,
5820,XIV,"Alive? he might be dead for aught I know,"
5821,XIV,"With that red gaunt and colloped neck a-strain,        80"
5822,XIV,And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;
5823,XIV,Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;
5824,XIV,I never saw a brute I hated so;
5825,XIV,He must be wicked to deserve such pain.
5826,XIV,
5827,XV,XV
5828,XV,
5829,XV,I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart.
5830,XV,"As a man calls for wine before he fights,"
5831,XV,"I asked one draught of earlier, happier sights,"
5832,XV,Ere fitly I could hope to play my part.
5833,XV,"Think first, fight afterwards--the soldier's art:"
5834,XV,One taste of the old time sets all to rights.          90
5835,XV,
5836,XVI,XVI
5837,XVI,
5838,XVI,Not it! I fancied Cuthbert's reddening face
5839,XVI,"Beneath its garniture of curly gold,"
5840,XVI,"Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold"
5841,XVI,An arm in mine to fix me to the place
5842,XVI,"That way he used.  Alas, one night's disgrace!"
5843,XVI,Out went my heart's new fire and left it cold.
5844,XVI,
5845,XVII,XVII
5846,XVII,
5847,XVII,"Giles then, the soul of honour--there he stands"
5848,XVII,Frank as ten years ago when knighted first.
5849,XVII,What honest man should dare (he said) he durst.
5850,XVII,Good-=but the scene shifts--faugh! what hangman hands         100
5851,XVII,Pin to his breast a parchment?  His own bands
5852,XVII,"Read it.  Poor traitor, spit upon and curst!"
5853,XVII,
5854,XVIII,XVIII
5855,XVIII,
5856,XVIII,Better this present than a past like that;
5857,XVIII,Back therefore to my darkening path again!
5858,XVIII,"No sound, no sight as far as eye could strain."
5859,XVIII,Will the night send a howlet or a bat?
5860,XVIII,I asked: when something on the dismal flat
5861,XVIII,Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train.
5862,XVIII,
5863,XIX,XIX
5864,XIX,
5865,XIX,A sudden little river crossed my path
5866,XIX,As unexpected as a serpent comes.                     110
5867,XIX,No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;
5868,XIX,"This, as it frothed by, might have been a bath"
5869,XIX,For the fiend's glowing hoof--to see the wrath
5870,XIX,Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes.
5871,XIX,
5872,XX,XX
5873,XX,
5874,XX,"So petty yet so spiteful!  All along,"
5875,XX,Low scrubby alders kneeled down over it
5876,XX,Drenched willows flung them headlong in a fit
5877,XX,"Of mute despair, a suicidal throng:"
5878,XX,"The river which had done them all the wrong,"
5879,XX,"Whate'er that was, rolled by, deterred no whit.       120"
5880,XX,
5881,XXI,XXI
5882,XXI,
5883,XXI,"Which, while I forded,--good saints, how I feared"
5884,XXI,"To set my foot upon a dead man's cheek,"
5885,XXI,"Each step, or feel the spear I thrust to seek"
5886,XXI,"For hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!"
5887,XXI,"--It may have been a water-rat I speared,"
5888,XXI,"But, ugh! it sounded like a baby's shriek."
5889,XXI,
5890,XXII,XXII
5891,XXII,
5892,XXII,Glad was I when I reached the other bank.
5893,XXII,Now for a better country.  Vain presage!
5894,XXII,"Who were the strugglers, what war did they wage,"
5895,XXII,Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank                  130
5896,XXII,"Soil to a plash? Toads in a poisoned tank,"
5897,XXII,Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage--
5898,XXII,
5899,XXIII,XXIII
5900,XXIII,
5901,XXIII,The fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque.
5902,XXIII,"What penned them there, with all the plain to choose?"
5903,XXIII,"No foot-print leading to that horrid mews,"
5904,XXIII,None out of it.  Mad brewage set to work
5905,XXIII,"Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk"
5906,XXIII,"Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews."
5907,XXIII,
5908,XXIV,XXIV
5909,XXIV,
5910,XXIV,"And more than that--a furlong on--why, there!"
5911,XXIV,"What bad use was that engine for, that wheel,         140"
5912,XXIV,"Or brake, not wheel--that harrow fit to reel"
5913,XXIV,Men's bodies out like silk? with all the air
5914,XXIV,"Of Tophet's tool, on earth left unaware"
5915,XXIV,Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.
5916,XXIV,
5917,XXV,XXV
5918,XXV,
5919,XXV,"Then came a bit of stubbed ground, once a wood,"
5920,XXV,"Next a marsh, it would seem, and now mere earth"
5921,XXV,"Desperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,"
5922,XXV,"Makes a thing and then mars it, till his mood"
5923,XXV,Changes and off he goes!) within a rood--
5924,XXV,"Bog, clay and rubble, sand and stark black dearth.    150"
5925,XXV,
5926,XXVI,XXVI
5927,XXVI,
5928,XXVI,"Now blotches rankling, coloured gay and grim,"
5929,XXVI,Now patches where some leanness of the soil's
5930,XXVI,Broke into moss or substances like boils;
5931,XXVI,"Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him"
5932,XXVI,Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim
5933,XXVI,"Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils."
5934,XXVI,
5935,XXVII,XXVII
5936,XXVII,
5937,XXVII,And just as far as ever from the end!
5938,XXVII,"Nought in the distance but the evening, nought"
5939,XXVII,To point my footstep further! At the thought
5940,XXVII,"A great black bird, Apollyon's bosom-friend,                  160"
5941,XXVII,"Sailed past, nor beat his wide wing dragon-penned"
5942,XXVII,That brushed my cap--perchance the guide I sought.
5943,XXVII,

5945,XXVIII,
5946,XXVIII,"For, looking up, aware I somehow grew,"
5947,XXVIII,"'Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place"
5948,XXVIII,All round to mountains--with such name to grace
5949,XXVIII,Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.
5950,XXVIII,"How thus they had surprised me,--solve it, you!"
5951,XXVIII,How to get from them was no clearer case.
5952,XXVIII,
5953,XXIX,XXIX
5954,XXIX,
5955,XXIX,Yet half I seemed to recognize some trick
5956,XXIX,"Of mischief happened to me, God knows when--          170"
5957,XXIX,"In a bad dream perhaps.   Here ended, then,"
5958,XXIX,"Progress this way.  When, in the very nick"
5959,XXIX,"Of giving up, one time more, came a click"

5962,XXX,XXX
5963,XXX,
5964,XXX,"Burningly it came on me all at once,"
5965,XXX,This was the place! those two hills on the right
5966,XXX,Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in fight;
5967,XXX,"While to the left, a tall scalped mountain... Dunce,"
5968,XXX,"Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,"
5969,XXX,After a life spent training for the sight!            180
5970,XXX,
5971,XXXI,XXXI
5972,XXXI,
5973,XXXI,What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?
5974,XXXI,"The round squat turret, blind as the fool's heart,"
5975,XXXI,"Built of brown stone, without a counterpart"
5976,XXXI,In the whole world.  The tempest's mocking elf

5982,XXXII,"Not see? because of night perhaps?--why, day"

5990,XXXIII,
5991,XXXIII,Not hear? when noise was everywhere! it tolled

6002,XXXIV,For one more picture! in a sheet of flame
6003,XXXIV,I saw them and I knew them all.  And yet
6004,XXXIV,"Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,"
6005,XXXIV,"And blew.  ""Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came."""
