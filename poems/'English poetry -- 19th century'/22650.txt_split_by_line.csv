117,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE
118,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
119,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
120,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"But, knowing now that they would have her speak,"
121,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"She threw her wet hair backward from her brow,"
122,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Her hand close to her mouth touching her cheek,"
123,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
124,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"As though she had had there a shameful blow,"
125,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And feeling it shameful to feel ought but shame
126,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"All through her heart, yet felt her cheek burned so,"
127,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
128,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,She must a little touch it; like one lame
129,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"She walked away from Gauwaine, with her head"
130,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Still lifted up; and on her cheek of flame
131,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
132,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,The tears dried quick; she stopped at last and said:
133,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"O knights and lords, it seems but little skill"
134,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,To talk of well-known things past now and dead.
135,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
136,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"God wot I ought to say, I have done ill,"
137,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And pray you all forgiveness heartily!
138,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Because you must be right, such great lords; still"
139,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
140,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Listen, suppose your time were come to die,"
141,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And you were quite alone and very weak;
142,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Yea, laid a dying while very mightily"
143,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
144,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak
145,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Of river through your broad lands running well:
146,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Suppose a hush should come, then some one speak:"
147,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
148,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"'One of these cloths is heaven, and one is hell,"
149,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Now choose one cloth for ever; which they be,"
150,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"I will not tell you, you must somehow tell"
151,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
152,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Of your own strength and mightiness; here, see!'"
153,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Yea, yea, my lord, and you to ope your eyes,"
154,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,At foot of your familiar bed to see
155,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
156,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"A great God's angel standing, with such dyes,"
157,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Not known on earth, on his great wings, and hands,"
158,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Held out two ways, light from the inner skies"
159,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
160,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Showing him well, and making his commands"
161,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Seem to be God's commands, moreover, too,"
162,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Holding within his hands the cloths on wands;
163,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
164,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And one of these strange choosing cloths was blue,"
165,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Wavy and long, and one cut short and red;"
166,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,No man could tell the better of the two.
167,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
168,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,After a shivering half-hour you said:
169,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"'God help! heaven's colour, the blue;' and he said, 'hell.'"
170,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Perhaps you then would roll upon your bed,"
171,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
172,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And cry to all good men that loved you well,"
173,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"'Ah Christ! if only I had known, known, known;'"
174,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Launcelot went away, then I could tell,"
175,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
176,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Like wisest man how all things would be, moan,"
177,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And roll and hurt myself, and long to die,"
178,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And yet fear much to die for what was sown.
179,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
180,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,"
181,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Whatever may have happened through these years,"
182,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie."
183,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
184,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Her voice was low at first, being full of tears,"
185,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"But as it cleared, it grew full loud and shrill,"
186,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Growing a windy shriek in all men's ears,"
187,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
188,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"A ringing in their startled brains, until"
189,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"She said that Gauwaine lied, then her voice sunk,"
190,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And her great eyes began again to fill,"
191,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
192,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Though still she stood right up, and never shrunk,"
193,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"But spoke on bravely, glorious lady fair!"
194,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Whatever tears her full lips may have drunk,"
195,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
196,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"She stood, and seemed to think, and wrung her hair,"
197,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Spoke out at last with no more trace of shame,"
198,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,With passionate twisting of her body there:
199,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
200,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,It chanced upon a day that Launcelot came
201,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,To dwell at Arthur's court: at Christmas-time
202,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"This happened; when the heralds sung his name,"
203,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
204,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Son of King Ban of Benwick, seemed to chime"
205,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Along with all the bells that rang that day,"
206,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"O'er the white roofs, with little change of rhyme."
207,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
208,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Christmas and whitened winter passed away,"
209,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And over me the April sunshine came,"
210,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Made very awful with black hail-clouds, yea"
211,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
212,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And in the Summer I grew white with flame,"
213,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And bowed my head down: Autumn, and the sick"
214,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Sure knowledge things would never be the same,"
215,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
216,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,However often Spring might be most thick
217,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Of blossoms and buds, smote on me, and I grew"
218,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Careless of most things, let the clock tick, tick,"
219,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
220,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"To my unhappy pulse, that beat right through"
221,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"My eager body; while I laughed out loud,"
222,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And let my lips curl up at false or true,"
223,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
224,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Seemed cold and shallow without any cloud.
225,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Behold my judges, then the cloths were brought;"
226,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"While I was dizzied thus, old thoughts would crowd,"
227,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
228,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Belonging to the time ere I was bought
229,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,By Arthur's great name and his little love;
230,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Must I give up for ever then, I thought,"
231,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
232,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,That which I deemed would ever round me move
233,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Glorifying all things; for a little word,"
234,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Scarce ever meant at all, must I now prove"
235,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
236,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Stone-cold for ever? Pray you, does the Lord"
237,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Will that all folks should be quite happy and good?
238,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"I love God now a little, if this cord"
239,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
240,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Were broken, once for all what striving could"
241,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Make me love anything in earth or heaven?
242,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"So day by day it grew, as if one should"
243,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
244,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Slip slowly down some path worn smooth and even,"
245,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Down to a cool sea on a summer day;
246,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Yet still in slipping there was some small leaven
247,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
248,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Of stretched hands catching small stones by the way,"
249,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Until one surely reached the sea at last,"
250,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And felt strange new joy as the worn head lay
251,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
252,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Back, with the hair like sea-weed; yea all past"
253,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Sweat of the forehead, dryness of the lips,"
254,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Washed utterly out by the dear waves o'ercast,"
255,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
256,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"In the lone sea, far off from any ships!"
257,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Do I not know now of a day in Spring?
258,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,No minute of that wild day ever slips
259,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
260,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"From out my memory; I hear thrushes sing,"
261,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And wheresoever I may be, straightway"
262,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Thoughts of it all come up with most fresh sting:
263,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
264,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"I was half mad with beauty on that day,"
265,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And went without my ladies all alone,"
266,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,In a quiet garden walled round every way;
267,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
268,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"I was right joyful of that wall of stone,"
269,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"That shut the flowers and trees up with the sky,"
270,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And trebled all the beauty: to the bone,"
271,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
272,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Yea right through to my heart, grown very shy"
273,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"With weary thoughts, it pierced, and made me glad;"
274,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Exceedingly glad, and I knew verily,"
275,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
276,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,A little thing just then had made me mad;
277,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"I dared not think, as I was wont to do,"
278,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Sometimes, upon my beauty; If I had"
279,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
280,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Held out my long hand up against the blue,"
281,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And, looking on the tenderly darken'd fingers,"
282,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Thought that by rights one ought to see quite through,"
283,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
284,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"There, see you, where the soft still light yet lingers,"
285,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Round by the edges; what should I have done,"
286,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"If this had joined with yellow spotted singers,"
287,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
288,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And startling green drawn upward by the sun?
289,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"But shouting, loosed out, see now! all my hair,"
290,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And trancedly stood watching the west wind run
291,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
292,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,With faintest half-heard breathing sound; why there
293,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,I lose my head e'en now in doing this;
294,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,But shortly listen: In that garden fair
295,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
296,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Came Launcelot walking; this is true, the kiss"
297,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Wherewith we kissed in meeting that spring day,"
298,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"I scarce dare talk of the remember'd bliss,"
299,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
300,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"When both our mouths went wandering in one way,"
301,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And aching sorely, met among the leaves;"
302,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Our hands being left behind strained far away.
303,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
304,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Never within a yard of my bright sleeves
305,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Had Launcelot come before: and now, so nigh!"
306,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,After that day why is it Guenevere grieves?
307,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
308,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,"
309,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Whatever happened on through all those years,"
310,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie."
311,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
312,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Being such a lady could I weep these tears
313,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,If this were true? A great queen such as I
314,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Having sinn'd this way, straight her conscience sears;"
315,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
316,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And afterwards she liveth hatefully,"
317,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Slaying and poisoning, certes never weeps:"
318,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Gauwaine be friends now, speak me lovingly."
319,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
320,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Do I not see how God's dear pity creeps
321,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"All through your frame, and trembles in your mouth?"
322,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Remember in what grave your mother sleeps,"
323,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
324,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Buried in some place far down in the south,"
325,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Men are forgetting as I speak to you;
326,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,By her head sever'd in that awful drouth
327,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
328,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Of pity that drew Agravaine's fell blow,"
329,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,I pray your pity! let me not scream out
330,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"For ever after, when the shrill winds blow"
331,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
332,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Through half your castle-locks! let me not shout
333,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,For ever after in the winter night
334,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,When you ride out alone! in battle-rout
335,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
336,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Let not my rusting tears make your sword light!
337,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Ah! God of mercy, how he turns away!"
338,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"So, ever must I dress me to the fight,"
339,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
340,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"So: let God's justice work! Gauwaine, I say,"
341,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,See me hew down your proofs: yea all men know
342,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Even as you said how Mellyagraunce one day,"
343,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
344,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"One bitter day in _la Fausse Garde_, for so"
345,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"All good knights held it after, saw:"
346,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Yea, sirs, by cursed unknightly outrage; though"
347,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
348,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"You, Gauwaine, held his word without a flaw,"
349,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,This Mellyagraunce saw blood upon my bed:
350,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Whose blood then pray you? is there any law
351,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
352,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,To make a queen say why some spots of red
353,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Lie on her coverlet? or will you say:
354,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Your hands are white, lady, as when you wed,"
355,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
356,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Where did you bleed? and must I stammer out, Nay,"
357,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"I blush indeed, fair lord, only to rend"
358,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"My sleeve up to my shoulder, where there lay"
359,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
360,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,A knife-point last night: so must I defend
361,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,The honour of the Lady Guenevere?
362,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Not so, fair lords, even if the world should end"
363,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
364,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"This very day, and you were judges here"
365,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Instead of God. Did you see Mellyagraunce
366,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,When Launcelot stood by him? what white fear
367,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
368,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Curdled his blood, and how his teeth did dance,"
369,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,His side sink in? as my knight cried and said:
370,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Slayer of unarm'd men, here is a chance!"
371,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
372,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Setter of traps, I pray you guard your head,"
373,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"By God I am so glad to fight with you,"
374,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Stripper of ladies, that my hand feels lead"
375,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
376,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"For driving weight; hurrah now! draw and do,"
377,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"For all my wounds are moving in my breast,"
378,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And I am getting mad with waiting so.
379,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
380,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"He struck his hands together o'er the beast,"
381,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Who fell down flat, and grovell'd at his feet,"
382,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And groan'd at being slain so young: At least,"
383,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
384,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"My knight said, rise you, sir, who are so fleet"
385,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"At catching ladies, half-arm'd will I fight,"
386,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"My left side all uncovered! then I weet,"
387,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
388,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Up sprang Sir Mellyagraunce with great delight
389,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Upon his knave's face; not until just then
390,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Did I quite hate him, as I saw my knight"
391,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
392,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Along the lists look to my stake and pen
393,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"With such a joyous smile, it made me sigh"
394,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"From agony beneath my waist-chain, when"
395,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
396,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"The fight began, and to me they drew nigh;"
397,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Ever Sir Launcelot kept him on the right,"
398,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And traversed warily, and ever high"
399,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
400,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And fast leapt caitiff's sword, until my knight"
401,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Sudden threw up his sword to his left hand,"
402,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Caught it, and swung it; that was all the fight,"
403,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
404,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Except a spout of blood on the hot land;
405,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,For it was hottest summer; and I know
406,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"I wonder'd how the fire, while I should stand,"
407,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
408,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And burn, against the heat, would quiver so,"
409,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Yards above my head; thus these matters went;
410,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Which things were only warnings of the woe
411,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
412,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"That fell on me. Yet Mellyagraunce was shent,"
413,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,For Mellyagraunce had fought against the Lord;
414,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Therefore, my lords, take heed lest you be blent"
415,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
416,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,With all this wickedness; say no rash word
417,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Against me, being so beautiful; my eyes,"
418,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Wept all away to grey, may bring some sword"
419,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
420,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"To drown you in your blood; see my breast rise,"
421,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Like waves of purple sea, as here I stand;"
422,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And how my arms are moved in wonderful wise,"
423,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
424,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Yea also at my full heart's strong command,"
425,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,See through my long throat how the words go up
426,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,In ripples to my mouth; how in my hand
427,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
428,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,The shadow lies like wine within a cup
429,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Of marvellously colour'd gold; yea now
430,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"This little wind is rising, look you up,"
431,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
432,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And wonder how the light is falling so
433,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Within my moving tresses: will you dare,"
434,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"When you have looked a little on my brow,"
435,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
436,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,To say this thing is vile? or will you care
437,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"For any plausible lies of cunning woof,"
438,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,When you can see my face with no lie there
439,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
440,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,For ever? am I not a gracious proof:
441,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,But in your chamber Launcelot was found:
442,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Is there a good knight then would stand aloof,"
443,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
444,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,When a queen says with gentle queenly sound:
445,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"O true as steel come now and talk with me,"
446,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,I love to see your step upon the ground
447,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
448,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Unwavering, also well I love to see"
449,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"That gracious smile light up your face, and hear"
450,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Your wonderful words, that all mean verily"
451,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
452,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"The thing they seem to mean: good friend, so dear"
453,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"To me in everything, come here to-night,"
454,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Or else the hours will pass most dull and drear;
455,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
456,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"If you come not, I fear this time I might"
457,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Get thinking over much of times gone by,"
458,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"When I was young, and green hope was in sight:"
459,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
460,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,For no man cares now to know why I sigh;
461,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And no man comes to sing me pleasant songs,"
462,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Nor any brings me the sweet flowers that lie
463,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
464,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,So thick in the gardens; therefore one so longs
465,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"To see you, Launcelot; that we may be"
466,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Like children once again, free from all wrongs"
467,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
468,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Just for one night. Did he not come to me?
469,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,What thing could keep true Launcelot away
470,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"If I said, Come? there was one less than three"
471,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
472,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"In my quiet room that night, and we were gay;"
473,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Till sudden I rose up, weak, pale, and sick,"
474,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Because a bawling broke our dream up, yea"
475,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
476,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"I looked at Launcelot's face and could not speak,"
477,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"For he looked helpless too, for a little while;"
478,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Then I remember how I tried to shriek,"
479,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
480,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And could not, but fell down; from tile to tile"
481,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,The stones they threw up rattled o'er my head
482,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,And made me dizzier; till within a while
483,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
484,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"My maids were all about me, and my head"
485,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,On Launcelot's breast was being soothed away
486,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"From its white chattering, until Launcelot said:"
487,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
488,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"By God! I will not tell you more to-day,"
489,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,Judge any way you will: what matters it?
490,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"You know quite well the story of that fray,"
491,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
492,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"How Launcelot still'd their bawling, the mad fit"
493,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"That caught up Gauwaine: all, all, verily,"
494,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,But just that which would save me; these things flit.
495,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
496,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Nevertheless you, O Sir Gauwaine, lie,"
497,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Whatever may have happen'd these long years,"
498,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"God knows I speak truth, saying that you lie!"
499,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
500,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"All I have said is truth, by Christ's dear tears."
501,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"She would not speak another word, but stood"
502,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Turn'd sideways; listening, like a man who hears"
503,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
504,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,His brother's trumpet sounding through the wood
505,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Of his foes' lances. She lean'd eagerly,"
506,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"And gave a slight spring sometimes, as she could"
507,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,
508,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,At last hear something really; joyfully
509,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Her cheek grew crimson, as the headlong speed"
510,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,"Of the roan charger drew all men to see,"
511,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,The knight who came was Launcelot at good need.
512,THE DEFENCE OF GUENEVERE,

517,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
518,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
519,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
520,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
521,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB
522,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
523,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
524,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Hot August noon: already on that day
525,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Since sunrise through the Wiltshire downs, most sad"
526,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Of mouth and eye, he had gone leagues of way;"
527,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Ay and by night, till whether good or bad"
528,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
529,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"He was, he knew not, though he knew perchance"
530,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"That he was Launcelot, the bravest knight"
531,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Of all who since the world was, have borne lance,"
532,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Or swung their swords in wrong cause or in right.
533,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
534,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Nay, he knew nothing now, except that where"
535,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"The Glastonbury gilded towers shine,"
536,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"A lady dwelt, whose name was Guenevere;"
537,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"This he knew also; that some fingers twine,"
538,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
539,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Not only in a man's hair, even his heart,"
540,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"(Making him good or bad I mean,) but in his life,"
541,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Skies, earth, men's looks and deeds, all that has part,"
542,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Not being ourselves, in that half-sleep, half-strife,"
543,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
544,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"(Strange sleep, strange strife,) that men call living; so"
545,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Was Launcelot most glad when the moon rose,"
546,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Because it brought new memories of her. ""Lo,"
547,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Between the trees a large moon, the wind lows"
548,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
549,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Not loud, but as a cow begins to low,"
550,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Wishing for strength to make the herdsman hear:
551,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"The ripe corn gathereth dew; yea, long ago,"
552,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"In the old garden life, my Guenevere"
553,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
554,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Loved to sit still among the flowers, till night"
555,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Had quite come on, hair loosen'd, for she said,"
556,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Smiling like heaven, that its fairness might"
557,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Draw up the wind sooner to cool her head.
558,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
559,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Now while I ride how quick the moon gets small,"
560,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,As it did then: I tell myself a tale
561,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"That will not last beyond the whitewashed wall,"
562,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Thoughts of some joust must help me through the vale,"
563,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
564,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Keep this till after: How Sir Gareth ran
565,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"A good course that day under my Queen's eyes,"
566,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And how she sway'd laughing at Dinadan.
567,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"No. Back again, the other thoughts will rise,"
568,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
569,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And yet I think so fast 'twill end right soon:
570,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Verily then I think, that Guenevere,"
571,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Made sad by dew and wind, and tree-barred moon,"
572,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Did love me more than ever, was more dear"
573,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
574,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"To me than ever, she would let me lie"
575,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And kiss her feet, or, if I sat behind,"
576,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Would drop her hand and arm most tenderly,"
577,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And touch my mouth. And she would let me wind
578,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
579,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Her hair around my neck, so that it fell"
580,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Upon my red robe, strange in the twilight"
581,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"With many unnamed colours, till the bell"
582,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Of her mouth on my cheek sent a delight
583,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
584,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Through all my ways of being; like the stroke
585,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Wherewith God threw all men upon the face
586,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"When he took Enoch, and when Enoch woke"
587,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,With a changed body in the happy place.
588,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
589,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Once, I remember, as I sat beside,"
590,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"She turn'd a little, and laid back her head,"
591,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And slept upon my breast; I almost died
592,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,In those night-watches with my love and dread.
593,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
594,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"There lily-like she bow'd her head and slept,"
595,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And I breathed low, and did not dare to move,"
596,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"But sat and quiver'd inwardly, thoughts crept,"
597,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And frighten'd me with pulses of my Love.
598,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
599,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,The stars shone out above the doubtful green
600,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Of her bodice, in the green sky overhead;"
601,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Pale in the green sky were the stars I ween,"
602,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Because the moon shone like a star she shed
603,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
604,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"When she dwelt up in heaven a while ago,"
605,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And ruled all things but God: the night went on,"
606,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"The wind grew cold, and the white moon grew low,"
607,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"One hand had fallen down, and now lay on"
608,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
609,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,My cold stiff palm; there were no colours then
610,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"For near an hour, and I fell asleep"
611,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"In spite of all my striving, even when"
612,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,I held her whose name-letters make me leap.
613,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
614,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"I did not sleep long, feeling that in sleep"
615,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"I did some loved one wrong, so that the sun"
616,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Had only just arisen from the deep
617,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Still land of colours, when before me one"
618,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
619,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Stood whom I knew, but scarcely dared to touch,"
620,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,She seemed to have changed so in the night;
621,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Moreover she held scarlet lilies, such"
622,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,As Maiden Margaret bears upon the light
623,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
624,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Of the great church walls, natheless did I walk"
625,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Through the fresh wet woods, and the wheat that morn,"
626,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Touching her hair and hand and mouth, and talk"
627,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Of love we held, nigh hid among the corn."
628,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
629,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Back to the palace, ere the sun grew high,"
630,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"We went, and in a cool green room all day"
631,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"I gazed upon the arras giddily,"
632,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Where the wind set the silken kings a-sway.
633,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
634,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"I could not hold her hand, or see her face;"
635,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"For which may God forgive me! but I think,"
636,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Howsoever, that she was not in that place."
637,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,These memories Launcelot was quick to drink;
638,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
639,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And when these fell, some paces past the wall,"
640,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"There rose yet others, but they wearied more,"
641,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And tasted not so sweet; they did not fall
642,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"So soon, but vaguely wrenched his strained heart sore"
643,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
644,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"In shadowy slipping from his grasp: these gone,"
645,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,A longing followed; if he might but touch
646,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"That Guenevere at once! Still night, the lone"
647,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Grey horse's head before him vex'd him much,"
648,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
649,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,In steady nodding over the grey road:
650,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Still night, and night, and night, and emptied heart"
651,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Of any stories; what a dismal load
652,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Time grew at last, yea, when the night did part,"
653,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
654,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And let the sun flame over all, still there"
655,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"The horse's grey ears turn'd this way and that,"
656,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And still he watch'd them twitching in the glare
657,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Of the morning sun, behind them still he sat,"
658,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
659,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Quite wearied out with all the wretched night,"
660,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Until about the dustiest of the day,"
661,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,On the last down's brow he drew his rein in sight
662,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Of the Glastonbury roofs that choke the way.
663,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
664,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And he was now quite giddy as before,"
665,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"When she slept by him, tired out, and her hair"
666,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Was mingled with the rushes on the floor,"
667,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And he, being tired too, was scarce aware"
668,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
669,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Of her presence; yet as he sat and gazed,"
670,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"A shiver ran throughout him, and his breath"
671,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Came slower, he seem'd suddenly amazed,"
672,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,As though he had not heard of Arthur's death.
673,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
674,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"This for a moment only, presently"
675,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"He rode on giddy still, until he reach'd"
676,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"A place of apple-trees, by the thorn-tree"
677,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Wherefrom St. Joseph in the days past preached.
678,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
679,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Dazed there he laid his head upon a tomb,"
680,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Not knowing it was Arthur's, at which sight"
681,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"One of her maidens told her, 'He is come,'"
682,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And she went forth to meet him; yet a blight
683,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
684,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Had settled on her, all her robes were black,"
685,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"With a long white veil only; she went slow,"
686,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"As one walks to be slain, her eyes did lack"
687,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Half her old glory, yea, alas! the glow"
688,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
689,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Had left her face and hands; this was because
690,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"As she lay last night on her purple bed,"
691,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Wishing for morning, grudging every pause"
692,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Of the palace clocks, until that Launcelot's head"
693,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
694,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Should lie on her breast, with all her golden hair"
695,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Each side: when suddenly the thing grew drear,"
696,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"In morning twilight, when the grey downs bare"
697,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Grew into lumps of sin to Guenevere.
698,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
699,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"At first she said no word, but lay quite still,"
700,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Only her mouth was open, and her eyes"
701,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Gazed wretchedly about from hill to hill;
702,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"As though she asked, not with so much surprise"
703,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
704,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"As tired disgust, what made them stand up there"
705,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"So cold and grey. After, a spasm took"
706,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Her face, and all her frame, she caught her hair,"
707,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"All her hair, in both hands, terribly she shook,"
708,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
709,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And rose till she was sitting in the bed,"
710,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Set her teeth hard, and shut her eyes and seem'd"
711,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"As though she would have torn it from her head,"
712,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Natheless she dropp'd it, lay down, as she deem'd"
713,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
714,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,It matter'd not whatever she might do:
715,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,O Lord Christ! pity on her ghastly face!
716,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Those dismal hours while the cloudless blue
717,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Drew the sun higher: He did give her grace;
718,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
719,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Because at last she rose up from her bed,"
720,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And put her raiment on, and knelt before"
721,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"The blessed rood, and with her dry lips said,"
722,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Muttering the words against the marble floor:
723,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
724,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"'Unless you pardon, what shall I do, Lord,"
725,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,But go to hell? and there see day by day
726,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Foul deed on deed, hear foulest word on word,"
727,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"For ever and ever, such as on the way"
728,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
729,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"To Camelot I heard once from a churl,"
730,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,That curled me up upon my jennet's neck
731,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"With bitter shame; how then, Lord, should I curl"
732,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,For ages and for ages? dost thou reck
733,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
734,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"That I am beautiful, Lord, even as you"
735,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And your dear mother? why did I forget
736,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"You were so beautiful, and good, and true,"
737,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"That you loved me so, Guenevere? O yet"
738,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
739,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"If even I go to hell, I cannot choose"
740,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"But love you, Christ, yea, though I cannot keep"
741,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,From loving Launcelot; O Christ! must I lose
742,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"My own heart's love? see, though I cannot weep,"
743,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
744,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Yet am I very sorry for my sin;
745,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Moreover, Christ, I cannot bear that hell,"
746,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"I am most fain to love you, and to win"
747,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,A place in heaven some time: I cannot tell:
748,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
749,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Speak to me, Christ! I kiss, kiss, kiss your feet;"
750,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Ah! now I weep!' The maid said, 'By the tomb"
751,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"He waiteth for you, lady,' coming fleet,"
752,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Not knowing what woe filled up all the room.
753,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
754,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"So Guenevere rose and went to meet him there,"
755,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"He did not hear her coming, as he lay"
756,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"On Arthur's head, till some of her long hair"
757,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Brush'd on the new-cut stone: 'Well done! to pray
758,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
759,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"For Arthur, my dear Lord, the greatest king"
760,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,That ever lived.' 'Guenevere! Guenevere!
761,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Do you not know me, are you gone mad? fling"
762,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Your arms and hair about me, lest I fear"
763,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
764,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"You are not Guenevere, but some other thing.'"
765,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"'Pray you forgive me, fair lord Launcelot!"
766,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"I am not mad, but I am sick; they cling,"
767,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"God's curses, unto such as I am; not"
768,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
769,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Ever again shall we twine arms and lips.'
770,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"'Yea, she is mad: thy heavy law, O Lord,"
771,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Is very tight about her now, and grips"
772,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Her poor heart, so that no right word"
773,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
774,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Can reach her mouth; so, Lord, forgive her now,"
775,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"That she not knowing what she does, being mad,"
776,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Kills me in this way; Guenevere, bend low"
777,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And kiss me once! for God's love kiss me! sad
778,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
779,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Though your face is, you look much kinder now;"
780,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Yea once, once for the last time kiss me, lest I die.'"
781,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"'Christ! my hot lips are very near his brow,"
782,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Help me to save his soul! Yea, verily,"
783,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
784,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Across my husband's head, fair Launcelot!"
785,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Fair serpent mark'd with V upon the head!
786,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"This thing we did while yet he was alive,"
787,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Why not, O twisting knight, now he is dead?"
788,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
789,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Yea, shake! shake now and shiver! if you can"
790,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Remember anything for agony,"
791,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Pray you remember how when the wind ran
792,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"One cool spring evening through fair aspen-tree,"
793,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
794,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And elm and oak about the palace there,"
795,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"The king came back from battle, and I stood"
796,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"To meet him, with my ladies, on the stair,"
797,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,My face made beautiful with my young blood.'
798,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
799,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"'Will she lie now, Lord God?' 'Remember too,"
800,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Wrung heart, how first before the knights there came"
801,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"A royal bier, hung round with green and blue,"
802,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,About it shone great tapers with sick flame.
803,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
804,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And thereupon Lucius, the Emperor,"
805,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Lay royal-robed, but stone-cold now and dead,"
806,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Not able to hold sword or sceptre more,"
807,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,But not quite grim; because his cloven head
808,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
809,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Bore no marks now of Launcelot's bitter sword,"
810,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Being by embalmers deftly solder'd up;
811,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"So still it seem'd the face of a great lord,"
812,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Being mended as a craftsman mends a cup.
813,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
814,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Also the heralds sung rejoicingly
815,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"To their long trumpets; Fallen under shield,"
816,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Here lieth Lucius, King of Italy,"
817,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Slain by Lord Launcelot in open field.
818,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
819,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Thereat the people shouted: Launcelot!
820,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And through the spears I saw you drawing nigh,"
821,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"You and Lord Arthur: nay, I saw you not,"
822,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"But rather Arthur, God would not let die,"
823,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
824,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"I hoped, these many years; he should grow great,"
825,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And in his great arms still encircle me,"
826,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Kissing my face, half blinded with the heat"
827,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Of king's love for the queen I used to be.
828,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
829,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Launcelot, Launcelot, why did he take your hand,"
830,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,When he had kissed me in his kingly way?
831,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Saying: This is the knight whom all the land
832,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Calls Arthur's banner, sword, and shield to-day;"
833,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
834,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Cherish him, love. Why did your long lips cleave"
835,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,In such strange way unto my fingers then?
836,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"So eagerly glad to kiss, so loath to leave"
837,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,When you rose up? Why among helmed men
838,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
839,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Could I always tell you by your long strong arms,"
840,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And sway like an angel's in your saddle there?
841,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Why sicken'd I so often with alarms
842,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Over the tilt-yard? Why were you more fair
843,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
844,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Than aspens in the autumn at their best?
845,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Why did you fill all lands with your great fame,"
846,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"So that Breuse even, as he rode, fear'd lest"
847,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,At turning of the way your shield should flame?
848,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
849,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Was it nought then, my agony and strife?"
850,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"When as day passed by day, year after year,"
851,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,I found I could not live a righteous life!
852,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Didst ever think queens held their truth for dear?
853,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
854,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"O, but your lips say: Yea, but she was cold"
855,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Sometimes, always uncertain as the spring;"
856,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"When I was sad she would be overbold,"
857,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Longing for kisses. When war-bells did ring,"
858,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
859,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,The back-toll'd bells of noisy Camelot.
860,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"'Now, Lord God, listen! listen, Guenevere,"
861,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Though I am weak just now, I think there's not"
862,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"A man who dares to say: You hated her,"
863,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
864,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And left her moaning while you fought your fill
865,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"In the daisied meadows! lo you her thin hand,"
866,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"That on the carven stone can not keep still,"
867,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Because she loves me against God's command,"
868,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
869,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Has often been quite wet with tear on tear,"
870,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Tears Launcelot keeps somewhere, surely not"
871,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"In his own heart, perhaps in Heaven, where"
872,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,He will not be these ages.' 'Launcelot!
873,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
874,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Loud lips, wrung heart! I say when the bells rang,"
875,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"The noisy back-toll'd bells of Camelot,"
876,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"There were two spots on earth, the thrushes sang"
877,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"In the lonely gardens where my love was not,"
878,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
879,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Where I was almost weeping; I dared not
880,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Weep quite in those days, lest one maid should say,"
881,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,In tittering whispers: Where is Launcelot
882,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,To wipe with some kerchief those tears away?
883,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
884,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Another answer sharply with brows knit,"
885,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And warning hand up, scarcely lower though:"
886,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"You speak too loud, see you, she heareth it,"
887,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"This tigress fair has claws, as I well know,"
888,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
889,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"As Launcelot knows too, the poor knight! well-a-day!"
890,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Why met he not with Iseult from the West,"
891,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Or better still, Iseult of Brittany?"
892,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Perchance indeed quite ladyless were best.
893,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
894,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Alas, my maids, you loved not overmuch"
895,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Queen Guenevere, uncertain as sunshine"
896,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"In March; forgive me! for my sin being such,"
897,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"About my whole life, all my deeds did twine,"
898,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
899,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Made me quite wicked; as I found out then,"
900,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,I think; in the lonely palace where each morn
901,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"We went, my maids and I, to say prayers when"
902,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,They sang mass in the chapel on the lawn.
903,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
904,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And every morn I scarce could pray at all,"
905,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"For Launcelot's red-golden hair would play,"
906,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Instead of sunlight, on the painted wall,"
907,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Mingled with dreams of what the priest did say;
908,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
909,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Grim curses out of Peter and of Paul;
910,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Judging of strange sins in Leviticus;
911,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Another sort of writing on the wall,"
912,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Scored deep across the painted heads of us.
913,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
914,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Christ sitting with the woman at the well,"
915,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And Mary Magdalen repenting there,"
916,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Her dimmed eyes scorch'd and red at sight of hell
917,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"So hardly 'scaped, no gold light on her hair."
918,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
919,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And if the priest said anything that seemed
920,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"To touch upon the sin they said we did,"
921,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,(This in their teeth) they looked as if they deem'd
922,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,That I was spying what thoughts might be hid
923,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
924,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Under green-cover'd bosoms, heaving quick"
925,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Beneath quick thoughts; while they grew red with shame,"
926,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And gazed down at their feet: while I felt sick,"
927,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And almost shriek'd if one should call my name.
928,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
929,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,The thrushes sang in the lone garden there:
930,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,But where you were the birds were scared I trow:
931,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Clanging of arms about pavilions fair,"
932,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Mixed with the knights' laughs; there, as I well know,"
933,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
934,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Rode Launcelot, the king of all the band,"
935,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And scowling Gauwaine, like the night in day,"
936,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And handsome Gareth, with his great white hand"
937,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Curl'd round the helm-crest, ere he join'd the fray;"
938,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
939,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And merry Dinadan with sharp dark face,"
940,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,All true knights loved to see; and in the fight
941,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Great Tristram, and though helmed you could trace"
942,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,In all his bearing the frank noble knight;
943,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
944,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And by him Palomydes, helmet off,"
945,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"He fought, his face brush'd by his hair,"
946,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Red heavy swinging hair; he fear'd a scoff
947,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"So overmuch, though what true knight would dare"
948,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
949,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"To mock that face, fretted with useless care,"
950,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,And bitter useless striving after love?
951,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"O Palomydes, with much honour bear"
952,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Beast Glatysaunt upon your shield, above"
953,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
954,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Your helm that hides the swinging of your hair,"
955,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And think of Iseult, as your sword drives through"
956,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Much mail and plate: O God, let me be there"
957,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"A little time, as I was long ago!"
958,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
959,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Because stout Gareth lets his spear fall low,"
960,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Gauwaine and Launcelot, and Dinadan"
961,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Are helm'd and waiting; let the trumpets go!
962,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Bend over, ladies, to see all you can!"
963,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
964,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Clench teeth, dames, yea, clasp hands, for Gareth's spear"
965,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Throws Kay from out his saddle, like a stone"
966,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,From a castle-window when the foe draws near:
967,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Iseult! Sir Dinadan rolleth overthrown.
968,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
969,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Iseult! again: the pieces of each spear
970,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Fly fathoms up, and both the great steeds reel;"
971,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Tristram for Iseult! Iseult! and Guenevere!
972,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,The ladies' names bite verily like steel.
973,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
974,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"They bite: bite me, Lord God! I shall go mad,"
975,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Or else die kissing him, he is so pale,"
976,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"He thinks me mad already, O bad! bad!"
977,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Let me lie down a little while and wail.'
978,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
979,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"'No longer so, rise up, I pray you, love,"
980,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And slay me really, then we shall be heal'd,"
981,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Perchance, in the aftertime by God above.'"
982,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"'Banner of Arthur, with black-bended shield"
983,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
984,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,Sinister-wise across the fair gold ground!
985,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Here let me tell you what a knight you are,"
986,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,O sword and shield of Arthur! you are found
987,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"A crooked sword, I think, that leaves a scar"
988,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
989,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"On the bearer's arm, so be he thinks it straight,"
990,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Twisted Malay's crease beautiful blue-grey,"
991,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Poison'd with sweet fruit; as he found too late,"
992,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"My husband Arthur, on some bitter day!"
993,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
994,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,O sickle cutting hemlock the day long!
995,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"That the husbandman across his shoulder hangs,"
996,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And, going homeward about evensong,"
997,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Dies the next morning, struck through by the fangs!"
998,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
999,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Banner, and sword, and shield, you dare not die,"
1000,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Lest you meet Arthur in the other world,"
1001,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"And, knowing who you are, he pass you by,"
1002,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Taking short turns that he may watch you curl'd,"
1003,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
1004,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Body and face and limbs in agony,"
1005,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Lest he weep presently and go away,"
1006,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Saying: I loved him once, with a sad sigh,"
1007,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Now I have slain him, Lord, let me go too, I pray."
1008,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,[Launcelot _falls_.
1009,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
1010,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Alas! alas! I know not what to do,"
1011,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,If I run fast it is perchance that I
1012,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"May fall and stun myself, much better so,"
1013,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"Never, never again! not even when I die.'"
1014,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
1015,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"LAUNCELOT, _on awaking_."
1016,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,
1017,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"'I stretch'd my hands towards her and fell down,"
1018,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,How long I lay in swoon I cannot tell:
1019,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"My head and hands were bleeding from the stone,"
1020,KING ARTHUR'S TOMB,"When I rose up, also I heard a bell.'"

1063,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And what if Palomydes also ride,"
1064,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",And over many a mountain and bare heath
1065,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Follow the questing beast with none beside?
1066,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Is he not able still to hold his breath
1067,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1068,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",With thoughts of Iseult? doth he not grow pale
1069,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","With weary striving, to seem best of all"
1070,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","To her, 'as she is best,' he saith? to fail"
1071,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Is nothing to him, he can never fall."
1072,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1073,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",For unto such a man love-sorrow is
1074,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","So dear a thing unto his constant heart,"
1075,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","That even if he never win one kiss,"
1076,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Or touch from Iseult, it will never part."
1077,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1078,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",And he will never know her to be worse
1079,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Than in his happiest dreams he thinks she is:
1080,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Good knight, and faithful, you have 'scaped the curse"
1081,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",In wonderful-wise; you have great store of bliss.
1082,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1083,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Yea, what if Father Launcelot ride out,"
1084,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Can he not think of Guenevere's arms, round"
1085,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Warm and lithe, about his neck, and shout"
1086,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Till all the place grows joyful with the sound?
1087,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1088,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And when he lists can often see her face,"
1089,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And think, 'Next month I kiss you, or next week,"
1090,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",And still you think of me': therefore the place
1091,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Grows very pleasant, whatsoever he seek."
1092,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1093,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","But me, who ride alone, some carle shall find"
1094,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Dead in my arms in the half-melted snow,"
1095,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","When all unkindly with the shifting wind,"
1096,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",The thaw comes on at Candlemas: I know
1097,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1098,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Indeed that they will say: 'This Galahad
1099,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",If he had lived had been a right good knight;
1100,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Ah! poor chaste body!' but they will be glad,"
1101,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Not most alone, but all, when in their sight"
1102,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1103,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",That very evening in their scarlet sleeves
1104,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",The gay-dress'd minstrels sing; no maid will talk
1105,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Of sitting on my tomb, until the leaves,"
1106,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Grown big upon the bushes of the walk,"
1107,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1108,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","East of the Palace-pleasaunce, make it hard"
1109,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",To see the minster therefrom: well-a-day!
1110,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Before the trees by autumn were well bared,"
1111,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","I saw a damozel with gentle play,"
1112,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1113,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Within that very walk say last farewell
1114,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","To her dear knight, just riding out to find"
1115,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","(Why should I choke to say it?) the Sangreal,"
1116,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And their last kisses sunk into my mind,"
1117,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1118,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Yea, for she stood lean'd forward on his breast,"
1119,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Rather, scarce stood; the back of one dear hand,"
1120,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","That it might well be kiss'd, she held and press'd"
1121,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Against his lips; long time they stood there, fann'd"
1122,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1123,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","By gentle gusts of quiet frosty wind,"
1124,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Till Mador de la porte a-going by,"
1125,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And my own horsehoofs roused them; they untwined,"
1126,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And parted like a dream. In this way I,"
1127,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1128,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","With sleepy face bent to the chapel floor,"
1129,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Kept musing half asleep, till suddenly"
1130,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","A sharp bell rang from close beside the door,"
1131,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And I leapt up when something pass'd me by,"
1132,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1133,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Shrill ringing going with it, still half blind"
1134,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","I stagger'd after, a great sense of awe"
1135,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","At every step kept gathering on my mind,"
1136,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Thereat I have no marvel, for I saw"
1137,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1138,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","One sitting on the altar as a throne,"
1139,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Whose face no man could say he did not know,"
1140,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And though the bell still rang, he sat alone,"
1141,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","With raiment half blood-red, half white as snow."
1142,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1143,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Right so I fell upon the floor and knelt,"
1144,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Not as one kneels in church when mass is said,"
1145,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","But in a heap, quite nerveless, for I felt"
1146,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",The first time what a thing was perfect dread.
1147,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1148,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",But mightily the gentle voice came down:
1149,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","'Rise up, and look and listen, Galahad,"
1150,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Good knight of God, for you will see no frown"
1151,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Upon my face; I come to make you glad.
1152,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1153,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","For that you say that you are all alone,"
1154,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","I will be with you always, and fear not"
1155,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","You are uncared for, though no maiden moan"
1156,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Above your empty tomb; for Launcelot,"
1157,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1158,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","He in good time shall be my servant too,"
1159,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Meantime, take note whose sword first made him knight,"
1160,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And who has loved him alway, yea, and who"
1161,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Still trusts him alway, though in all men's sight,"
1162,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1163,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","He is just what you know, O Galahad,"
1164,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","This love is happy even as you say,"
1165,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","But would you for a little time be glad,"
1166,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","To make ME sorry long, day after day?"
1167,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1168,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Her warm arms round his neck half throttle ME,"
1169,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","The hot love-tears burn deep like spots of lead,"
1170,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Yea, and the years pass quick: right dismally"
1171,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Will Launcelot at one time hang his head;
1172,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1173,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Yea, old and shrivell'd he shall win my love."
1174,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Poor Palomydes fretting out his soul!
1175,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Not always is he able, son, to move"
1176,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","His love, and do it honour: needs must roll"
1177,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1178,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","The proudest destrier sometimes in the dust,"
1179,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",And then 'tis weary work; he strives beside
1180,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Seem better than he is, so that his trust"
1181,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Is always on what chances may betide;
1182,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1183,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And so he wears away, my servant, too,"
1184,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","When all these things are gone, and wretchedly"
1185,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","He sits and longs to moan for Iseult, who"
1186,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Is no care now to Palomydes: see,"
1187,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1188,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","O good son Galahad, upon this day,"
1189,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Now even, all these things are on your side,"
1190,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","But these you fight not for; look up, I say,"
1191,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And see how I can love you, for no pride"
1192,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1193,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Closes your eyes, no vain lust keeps them down."
1194,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",See now you have ME always; following
1195,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","That holy vision, Galahad, go on,"
1196,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Until at last you come to ME to sing
1197,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1198,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","In Heaven always, and to walk around"
1199,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","The garden where I am.' He ceased, my face"
1200,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",And wretched body fell upon the ground;
1201,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And when I look'd again, the holy place"
1202,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1203,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Was empty; but right so the bell again
1204,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Came to the chapel-door, there entered"
1205,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Two angels first, in white, without a stain,"
1206,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And scarlet wings, then, after them, a bed"
1207,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1208,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Four ladies bore, and set it down beneath"
1209,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","The very altar-step, and while for fear"
1210,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","I scarcely dared to move or draw my breath,"
1211,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Those holy ladies gently came a-near,"
1212,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1213,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","And quite unarm'd me, saying: 'Galahad,"
1214,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Rest here awhile and sleep, and take no thought"
1215,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Of any other thing than being glad;
1216,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Hither the Sangreal will be shortly brought,"
1217,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1218,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",Yet must you sleep the while it stayeth here.'
1219,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Right so they went away, and I, being weary,"
1220,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","Slept long and dream'd of Heaven: the bell comes near,"
1221,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",I doubt it grows to morning. Miserere!
1222,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY",
1223,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","_Enter Two Angels in white, with scarlet wings; also, Four Ladies in"
1224,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","gowns of red and green; also an Angel, bearing in his hands a"
1225,"SIR GALAHAD, A CHRISTMAS MYSTERY","surcoat of white, with a red cross._"

1286,GALAHAD.,"_Enter_ Sir Bors, Sir Percival, _and_ his Sister."
1287,GALAHAD.,
1288,GALAHAD.,"Fair friends and gentle lady, God you save!"
1289,GALAHAD.,A many marvels have been here to-night;

1296,SIR BORS.,"As we were riding slowly side by side,"
1297,SIR BORS.,"An hour ago, we heard a sweet voice sing,"
1298,SIR BORS.,"And through the bare twigs saw a great light glide,"
1299,SIR BORS.,
1300,SIR BORS.,"With many-colour'd raiment, but far off;"
1301,SIR BORS.,And so pass'd quickly: from the court nought good;

1303,SIR BORS.,"Kept us all merry, in a little wood"
1304,SIR BORS.,
1305,SIR BORS.,Was found all hack'd and dead: Sir Lionel
1306,SIR BORS.,"And Gauwaine have come back from the great quest,"
1307,SIR BORS.,"Just merely shamed; and Lauvaine, who loved well"
1308,SIR BORS.,"Your father Launcelot, at the king's behest"
1309,SIR BORS.,
1310,SIR BORS.,"Went out to seek him, but was almost slain,"

1329,SIR OZANA.,
1330,SIR OZANA.,"All day long and every day,"
1331,SIR OZANA.,"From Christmas-Eve to Whit-Sunday,"
1332,SIR OZANA.,"Within that Chapel-aisle I lay,"
1333,SIR OZANA.,And no man came a-near.
1334,SIR OZANA.,
1335,SIR OZANA.,"Naked to the waist was I,"
1336,SIR OZANA.,"And deep within my breast did lie,"
1337,SIR OZANA.,"Though no man any blood could spy,"
1338,SIR OZANA.,The truncheon of a spear.
1339,SIR OZANA.,
1340,SIR OZANA.,No meat did ever pass my lips
1341,SIR OZANA.,Those days. Alas! the sunlight slips
1342,SIR OZANA.,"From off the gilded parclose, dips,"
1343,SIR OZANA.,And night comes on apace.
1344,SIR OZANA.,
1345,SIR OZANA.,My arms lay back behind my head;
1346,SIR OZANA.,Over my raised-up knees was spread
1347,SIR OZANA.,A samite cloth of white and red;
1348,SIR OZANA.,A rose lay on my face.
1349,SIR OZANA.,
1350,SIR OZANA.,Many a time I tried to shout;
1351,SIR OZANA.,"But as in dream of battle-rout,"
1352,SIR OZANA.,My frozen speech would not well out;
1353,SIR OZANA.,I could not even weep.
1354,SIR OZANA.,
1355,SIR OZANA.,With inward sigh I see the sun
1356,SIR OZANA.,"Fade off the pillars one by one,"
1357,SIR OZANA.,"My heart faints when the day is done,"
1358,SIR OZANA.,Because I cannot sleep.
1359,SIR OZANA.,
1360,SIR OZANA.,Sometimes strange thoughts pass through my head;
1361,SIR OZANA.,"Not like a tomb is this my bed,"
1362,SIR OZANA.,Yet oft I think that I am dead;
1363,SIR OZANA.,"That round my tomb is writ,"
1364,SIR OZANA.,
1365,SIR OZANA.,"'Ozana of the hardy heart,"
1366,SIR OZANA.,"Knight of the Table Round,"
1367,SIR OZANA.,"Pray for his soul, lords, of your part;"
1368,SIR OZANA.,A true knight he was found.'
1369,SIR OZANA.,"Ah! me, I cannot fathom it.      [_He sleeps._"
1370,SIR OZANA.,
1371,SIR GALAHAD.,SIR GALAHAD.
1372,SIR GALAHAD.,
1373,SIR GALAHAD.,"All day long and every day,"
1374,SIR GALAHAD.,"Till his madness pass'd away,"
1375,SIR GALAHAD.,I watch'd Ozana as he lay
1376,SIR GALAHAD.,Within the gilded screen.
1377,SIR GALAHAD.,
1378,SIR GALAHAD.,All my singing moved him not;
1379,SIR GALAHAD.,"As I sung my heart grew hot,"
1380,SIR GALAHAD.,With the thought of Launcelot
1381,SIR GALAHAD.,"Far away, I ween."
1382,SIR GALAHAD.,
1383,SIR GALAHAD.,So I went a little space
1384,SIR GALAHAD.,"From out the chapel, bathed my face"
1385,SIR GALAHAD.,In the stream that runs apace
1386,SIR GALAHAD.,By the churchyard wall.
1387,SIR GALAHAD.,
1388,SIR GALAHAD.,"There I pluck'd a faint wild rose,"
1389,SIR GALAHAD.,"Hard by where the linden grows,"
1390,SIR GALAHAD.,Sighing over silver rows
1391,SIR GALAHAD.,Of the lilies tall.
1392,SIR GALAHAD.,
1393,SIR GALAHAD.,I laid the flower across his mouth;
1394,SIR GALAHAD.,The sparkling drops seem'd good for drouth;
1395,SIR GALAHAD.,"He smiled, turn'd round towards the south."
1396,SIR GALAHAD.,Held up a golden tress.
1397,SIR GALAHAD.,
1398,SIR GALAHAD.,The light smote on it from the west;
1399,SIR GALAHAD.,"He drew the covering from his breast,"
1400,SIR GALAHAD.,Against his heart that hair he prest;
1401,SIR GALAHAD.,Death him soon will bless.
1402,SIR GALAHAD.,
1403,SIR BORS.,SIR BORS.
1404,SIR BORS.,
1405,SIR BORS.,I enter'd by the western door;
1406,SIR BORS.,I saw a knight's helm lying there:
1407,SIR BORS.,"I raised my eyes from off the floor,"
1408,SIR BORS.,And caught the gleaming of his hair.
1409,SIR BORS.,
1410,SIR BORS.,I stept full softly up to him;
1411,SIR BORS.,I laid my chin upon his head;
1412,SIR BORS.,"I felt him smile; my eyes did swim,"
1413,SIR BORS.,I was so glad he was not dead.
1414,SIR BORS.,
1415,SIR BORS.,"I heard Ozana murmur low,"
1416,SIR BORS.,'There comes no sleep nor any love.'
1417,SIR BORS.,But Galahad stoop'd and kiss'd his brow:
1418,SIR BORS.,He shiver'd; I saw his pale lips move.
1419,SIR BORS.,
1420,SIR OZANA.,SIR OZANA.
1421,SIR OZANA.,
1422,SIR OZANA.,There comes no sleep nor any love;
1423,SIR OZANA.,Ah me! I shiver with delight.
1424,SIR OZANA.,I am so weak I cannot move;
1425,SIR OZANA.,"God move me to thee, dear, to-night!"
1426,SIR OZANA.,Christ help! I have but little wit:
1427,SIR OZANA.,"My life went wrong; I see it writ,"
1428,SIR OZANA.,
1429,SIR OZANA.,"'Ozana of the hardy heart,"
1430,SIR OZANA.,"Knight of the Table Round,"
1431,SIR OZANA.,"Pray for his soul, lords, on your part;"
1432,SIR OZANA.,A good knight he was found.'
1433,SIR OZANA.,
1434,SIR OZANA.,Now I begin to fathom it.      [_He dies._
1435,SIR OZANA.,
1436,SIR BORS.,SIR BORS.
1437,SIR BORS.,
1438,SIR BORS.,Galahad sits dreamily;
1439,SIR BORS.,"What strange things may his eyes see,"
1440,SIR BORS.,Great blue eyes fix'd full on me?
1441,SIR BORS.,"On his soul, Lord, have mercy."

1444,SIR GALAHAD.,
1445,SIR GALAHAD.,"Ozana, shall I pray for thee?"
1446,SIR GALAHAD.,Her cheek is laid to thine;
1447,SIR GALAHAD.,"No long time hence, also I see"
1448,SIR GALAHAD.,Thy wasted fingers twine
1449,SIR GALAHAD.,
1450,SIR GALAHAD.,Within the tresses of her hair
1451,SIR GALAHAD.,"That shineth gloriously,"

1473,JOHN CURZON.,"Of those three prisoners, that before you came"
1474,JOHN CURZON.,"We took down at St. John's hard by the mill,"
1475,JOHN CURZON.,"Two are good masons; we have tools enough,"
1476,JOHN CURZON.,And you have skill to set them working.

1478,JOHN CURZON.,
1479,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1480,SIR PETER.,
1481,SIR PETER.,So:

1484,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1485,JOHN CURZON.,
1486,JOHN CURZON.,"Why, Jacques Aquadent,"
1487,JOHN CURZON.,"And Peter Plombiere, but,"
1488,JOHN CURZON.,
1489,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1490,SIR PETER.,
1491,SIR PETER.,What colour'd hair
1492,SIR PETER.,Has Peter now? has Jacques got bow legs?
1493,SIR PETER.,
1494,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1495,JOHN CURZON.,
1496,JOHN CURZON.,"Why, sir, you jest: what matters Jacques' hair,"
1497,JOHN CURZON.,Or Peter's legs to us?
1498,JOHN CURZON.,
1499,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1500,SIR PETER.,
1501,SIR PETER.,"O! John, John, John!"
1502,SIR PETER.,"Throw all your mason's tools down the deep well,"
1503,SIR PETER.,"Hang Peter up and Jacques; They're no good,"
1504,SIR PETER.,"We shall not build, man."
1505,SIR PETER.,
1506,SIR PETER.,JOHN CURZON (_going_).
1507,SIR PETER.,
1508,SIR PETER.,Shall I call the guard
1509,SIR PETER.,"To hang them, sir? and yet, sir, for the tools,"
1510,SIR PETER.,"We'd better keep them still; sir, fare you well."
1511,SIR PETER.,[_Muttering as he goes._
1512,SIR PETER.,What have I done that he should jape at me?
1513,SIR PETER.,"And why not build? the walls are weak enough,"
1514,SIR PETER.,And we've two masons and a heap of tools.
1515,SIR PETER.,"[_Goes, still muttering._"
1516,SIR PETER.,
1517,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1518,SIR PETER.,
1519,SIR PETER.,To think a man should have a lump like that
1520,SIR PETER.,"For his lieutenant! I must call him back,"
1521,SIR PETER.,"Or else, as surely as St. George is dead,"
1522,SIR PETER.,"He'll hang our friends the masons: here, John! John!"
1523,SIR PETER.,
1524,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1525,JOHN CURZON.,
1526,JOHN CURZON.,"At your good service, sir."
1527,JOHN CURZON.,
1528,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1529,SIR PETER.,
1530,SIR PETER.,"Come now, and talk"
1531,SIR PETER.,"This weighty matter out; there, we've no stone"
1532,SIR PETER.,"To mend our walls with, neither brick nor stone."
1533,SIR PETER.,
1534,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1535,JOHN CURZON.,
1536,JOHN CURZON.,"There is a quarry, sir, some ten miles off."
1537,JOHN CURZON.,
1538,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1539,SIR PETER.,
1540,SIR PETER.,We are not strong enough to send ten men
1541,SIR PETER.,Ten miles to fetch us stone enough to build.
1542,SIR PETER.,"In three hours' time they would be taken or slain,"
1543,SIR PETER.,The cursed Frenchmen ride abroad so thick.
1544,SIR PETER.,
1545,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1546,JOHN CURZON.,
1547,JOHN CURZON.,But we can send some villaynes to get stone.
1548,JOHN CURZON.,
1549,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1550,SIR PETER.,
1551,SIR PETER.,"Alas! John, that we cannot bring them back,"
1552,SIR PETER.,"They would go off to Clisson or Sanxere,"
1553,SIR PETER.,"And tell them we were weak in walls and men,"
1554,SIR PETER.,"Then down go we; for, look you, times are changed,"
1555,SIR PETER.,And now no longer does the country shake
1556,SIR PETER.,At sound of English names; our captains fade
1557,SIR PETER.,From off our muster-rolls. At Lusac bridge
1558,SIR PETER.,I daresay you may even yet see the hole
1559,SIR PETER.,That Chandos beat in dying; far in Spain
1560,SIR PETER.,Pembroke is prisoner; Phelton prisoner here;
1561,SIR PETER.,Manny lies buried in the Charterhouse;
1562,SIR PETER.,Oliver Clisson turn'd these years agone;
1563,SIR PETER.,"The Captal died in prison; and, over all,"
1564,SIR PETER.,"Edward the prince lies underneath the ground,"
1565,SIR PETER.,"Edward the king is dead, at Westminster"
1566,SIR PETER.,The carvers smooth the curls of his long beard.
1567,SIR PETER.,Everything goes to rack--eh! and we too.
1568,SIR PETER.,"Now, Curzon, listen; if they come, these French,"
1569,SIR PETER.,"Whom have I got to lean on here, but you?"
1570,SIR PETER.,"A man can die but once, will you die then,"
1571,SIR PETER.,"Your brave sword in your hand, thoughts in your heart"
1572,SIR PETER.,Of all the deeds we have done here in France--
1573,SIR PETER.,"And yet may do? So God will have your soul,"
1574,SIR PETER.,Whoever has your body.
1575,SIR PETER.,
1576,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1577,JOHN CURZON.,
1578,JOHN CURZON.,"Why, sir, I"
1579,JOHN CURZON.,"Will fight till the last moment, until then"
1580,JOHN CURZON.,Will do whate'er you tell me. Now I see
1581,JOHN CURZON.,"We must e'en leave the walls; well, well, perhaps"
1582,JOHN CURZON.,"They're stronger than I think for; pity, though!"
1583,JOHN CURZON.,"For some few tons of stone, if Guesclin comes."
1584,JOHN CURZON.,
1585,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1586,SIR PETER.,
1587,SIR PETER.,"Farewell, John, pray you watch the Gascons well,"
1588,SIR PETER.,I doubt them.
1589,SIR PETER.,
1590,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1591,JOHN CURZON.,
1592,JOHN CURZON.,"Truly, sir, I will watch well.      [_Goes._"
1593,JOHN CURZON.,
1594,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1595,SIR PETER.,
1596,SIR PETER.,"Farewell, good lump! and yet, when all is said,"
1597,SIR PETER.,"'Tis a good lump. Why then, if Guesclin comes;"
1598,SIR PETER.,"Some dozen stones from his petrariae,"
1599,SIR PETER.,"And, under shelter of his crossbows, just"
1600,SIR PETER.,"An hour's steady work with pickaxes,"
1601,SIR PETER.,Then a great noise--some dozen swords and glaives
1602,SIR PETER.,"A-playing on my basnet all at once,"
1603,SIR PETER.,And little more cross purposes on earth
1604,SIR PETER.,For me.
1605,SIR PETER.,"Now this is hard: a month ago,"
1606,SIR PETER.,And a few minutes' talk had set things right
1607,SIR PETER.,"'Twixt me and Alice; if she had a doubt,"
1608,SIR PETER.,"As, may Heaven bless her! I scarce think she had,"
1609,SIR PETER.,"'Twas but their hammer, hammer in her ears,"
1610,SIR PETER.,Of how Sir Peter fail'd at Lusac Bridge:
1611,SIR PETER.,And how he was grown moody of late days;
1612,SIR PETER.,"And how Sir Lambert, think now! his dear friend,"
1613,SIR PETER.,"His sweet, dear cousin, could not but confess"
1614,SIR PETER.,"That Peter's talk tended towards the French,"
1615,SIR PETER.,"Which he, for instance Lambert, was glad of,"
1616,SIR PETER.,"Being, Lambert, you see, on the French side."
1617,SIR PETER.,"Well,"
1618,SIR PETER.,"If I could but have seen her on that day,"
1619,SIR PETER.,"Then, when they sent me off!"
1620,SIR PETER.,"I like to think,"
1621,SIR PETER.,"Although it hurts me, makes my head twist, what,"
1622,SIR PETER.,"If I had seen her, what I should have said,"
1623,SIR PETER.,"What she, my darling, would have said and done."
1624,SIR PETER.,As thus perchance.
1625,SIR PETER.,"To find her sitting there,"
1626,SIR PETER.,"In the window-seat, not looking well at all,"
1627,SIR PETER.,"Crying perhaps, and I say quietly:"
1628,SIR PETER.,"Alice! she looks up, chokes a sob, looks grave,"
1629,SIR PETER.,"Changes from pale to red, but, ere she speaks,"
1630,SIR PETER.,"Straightway I kneel down there on both my knees,"
1631,SIR PETER.,"And say: O lady, have I sinn'd, your knight?"
1632,SIR PETER.,That still you ever let me walk alone
1633,SIR PETER.,"In the rose garden, that you sing no songs"
1634,SIR PETER.,"When I am by, that ever in the dance"
1635,SIR PETER.,You quietly walk away when I come near?
1636,SIR PETER.,"Now that I have you, will you go, think you?"
1637,SIR PETER.,
1638,SIR PETER.,"Ere she could answer I would speak again,"
1639,SIR PETER.,Still kneeling there.
1640,SIR PETER.,"What! they have frighted you,"
1641,SIR PETER.,"By hanging burs, and clumsily carven puppets,"
1642,SIR PETER.,"Round my good name; but afterwards, my love,"
1643,SIR PETER.,"I will say what this means; this moment, see!"
1644,SIR PETER.,"Do I kneel here, and can you doubt me? Yea:"
1645,SIR PETER.,For she would put her hands upon my face:
1646,SIR PETER.,"Yea, that is best, yea feel, love, am I changed?"
1647,SIR PETER.,"And she would say: Good knight, come, kiss my lips!"
1648,SIR PETER.,And afterwards as I sat there would say:
1649,SIR PETER.,
1650,SIR PETER.,Please a poor silly girl by telling me
1651,SIR PETER.,"What all those things they talk of really were,"
1652,SIR PETER.,"For it is true you did not help Chandos,"
1653,SIR PETER.,"And true, poor love! you could not come to me"
1654,SIR PETER.,When I was in such peril.
1655,SIR PETER.,I should say:
1656,SIR PETER.,"I am like Balen, all things turn to blame."
1657,SIR PETER.,I did not come to you? At Bergerath
1658,SIR PETER.,"The constable had held us close shut up,"
1659,SIR PETER.,"If from the barriers I had made three steps,"
1660,SIR PETER.,"I should have been but slain; at Lusac, too,"
1661,SIR PETER.,"We struggled in a marish half the day,"
1662,SIR PETER.,"And came too late at last: you know, my love,"
1663,SIR PETER.,How heavy men and horses are all arm'd.
1664,SIR PETER.,"All that Sir Lambert said was pure, unmix'd,"
1665,SIR PETER.,"Quite groundless lies; as you can think, sweet love."
1666,SIR PETER.,
1667,SIR PETER.,"She, holding tight my hand as we sat there,"
1668,SIR PETER.,"Started a little at Sir Lambert's name,"
1669,SIR PETER.,But otherwise she listen'd scarce at all
1670,SIR PETER.,"To what I said. Then with moist, weeping eyes,"
1671,SIR PETER.,"And quivering lips, that scarcely let her speak,"
1672,SIR PETER.,She said: I love you.
1673,SIR PETER.,"Other words were few,"
1674,SIR PETER.,The remnant of that hour; her hand smooth'd down
1675,SIR PETER.,My foolish head; she kiss'd me all about
1676,SIR PETER.,"My face, and through the tangles of my beard"
1677,SIR PETER.,Her little fingers crept!
1678,SIR PETER.,
1679,SIR PETER.,"O God, my Alice,"
1680,SIR PETER.,Not this good way: my lord but sent and said
1681,SIR PETER.,"That Lambert's sayings were taken at their worth,"
1682,SIR PETER.,"Therefore that day I was to start, and keep"
1683,SIR PETER.,This hold against the French; and I am here:
1684,SIR PETER.,[_Looks out of the window._
1685,SIR PETER.,"A sprawling lonely garde with rotten walls,"
1686,SIR PETER.,"And no one to bring aid if Guesclin comes,"
1687,SIR PETER.,Or any other.
1688,SIR PETER.,There's a pennon now!
1689,SIR PETER.,At last.
1690,SIR PETER.,"But not the constable's: whose arms,"
1691,SIR PETER.,"I wonder, does it bear? Three golden rings"
1692,SIR PETER.,On a red ground; my cousin's by the rood!
1693,SIR PETER.,"Well, I should like to kill him, certainly,"
1694,SIR PETER.,But to be kill'd by him:      [_A trumpet sounds._
1695,SIR PETER.,That's for a herald;
1696,SIR PETER.,I doubt this does not mean assaulting yet.
1697,SIR PETER.,
1698,SIR PETER.,_Enter_ John Curzon.
1699,SIR PETER.,
1700,SIR PETER.,"What says the herald of our cousin, sir?"
1701,SIR PETER.,
1702,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1703,JOHN CURZON.,
1704,JOHN CURZON.,"So please you, sir, concerning your estate,"
1705,JOHN CURZON.,He has good will to talk with you.
1706,JOHN CURZON.,
1707,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1708,SIR PETER.,
1709,SIR PETER.,"Outside,"
1710,SIR PETER.,"I'll talk with him, close by the gate St. Ives."
1711,SIR PETER.,Is he unarm'd?
1712,SIR PETER.,
1713,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1714,JOHN CURZON.,
1715,JOHN CURZON.,"Yea, sir, in a long gown."
1716,JOHN CURZON.,
1717,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1718,SIR PETER.,
1719,SIR PETER.,Then bid them bring me hither my furr'd gown
1720,SIR PETER.,"With the long sleeves, and under it I'll wear,"
1721,SIR PETER.,"By Lambert's leave, a secret coat of mail;"
1722,SIR PETER.,"And will you lend me, John, your little axe?"
1723,SIR PETER.,I mean the one with Paul wrought on the blade?
1724,SIR PETER.,"And I will carry it inside my sleeve,"
1725,SIR PETER.,"Good to be ready always; you, John, go"
1726,SIR PETER.,"And bid them set up many suits of arms,"
1727,SIR PETER.,"Bows, archgays, lances, in the base-court, and"
1728,SIR PETER.,"Yourself, from the south postern setting out,"
1729,SIR PETER.,"With twenty men, be ready to break through"
1730,SIR PETER.,"Their unguarded rear when I cry out, St. George!"
1731,SIR PETER.,
1732,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1733,JOHN CURZON.,
1734,JOHN CURZON.,"How, sir! will you attack him unawares,"
1735,JOHN CURZON.,And slay him unarm'd?
1736,JOHN CURZON.,
1737,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1738,SIR PETER.,
1739,SIR PETER.,"Trust me, John, I know"
1740,SIR PETER.,"The reason why he comes here with sleeved gown,"
1741,SIR PETER.,"Fit to hide axes up. So, let us go.      [_They go._"
1742,SIR PETER.,
1743,SIR PETER.,
1744,SIR PETER.,_Outside the castle by the great gate;_ Sir Lambert _and_ Sir Peter
1745,SIR PETER.,"_seated; guards attending each, the rest of_ Sir Lambert's _men"
1746,SIR PETER.,drawn up about a furlong off._
1747,SIR PETER.,
1748,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1749,SIR PETER.,
1750,SIR PETER.,And if I choose to take the losing side
1751,SIR PETER.,"Still, does it hurt you?"
1752,SIR PETER.,
1753,SIR LAMBERT.,SIR LAMBERT.
1754,SIR LAMBERT.,
1755,SIR LAMBERT.,O! no hurt to me;
1756,SIR LAMBERT.,"I see you sneering, Why take trouble then,"
1757,SIR LAMBERT.,"Seeing you love me not? Look you, our house"
1758,SIR LAMBERT.,"(Which, taken altogether, I love much)"
1759,SIR LAMBERT.,"Had better be upon the right side now,"
1760,SIR LAMBERT.,"If, once for all, it wishes to bear rule"
1761,SIR LAMBERT.,"As such a house should: cousin, you're too wise"
1762,SIR LAMBERT.,"To feed your hope up fat, that this fair France"
1763,SIR LAMBERT.,Will ever draw two ways again; this side
1764,SIR LAMBERT.,"The French, wrong-headed, all a-jar"
1765,SIR LAMBERT.,With envious longings; and the other side
1766,SIR LAMBERT.,"The order'd English, orderly led on"
1767,SIR LAMBERT.,"By those two Edwards through all wrong and right,"
1768,SIR LAMBERT.,And muddling right and wrong to a thick broth
1769,SIR LAMBERT.,"With that long stick, their strength. This is all changed,"
1770,SIR LAMBERT.,"The true French win, on either side you have"
1771,SIR LAMBERT.,"Cool-headed men, good at a tilting match,"
1772,SIR LAMBERT.,"And good at setting battles in array,"
1773,SIR LAMBERT.,And good at squeezing taxes at due time;
1774,SIR LAMBERT.,Therefore by nature we French being here
1775,SIR LAMBERT.,Upon our own big land:      [_Sir Peter laughs aloud._
1776,SIR LAMBERT.,"Well, Peter! well!"
1777,SIR LAMBERT.,What makes you laugh?
1778,SIR LAMBERT.,
1779,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1780,SIR PETER.,
1781,SIR PETER.,Hearing you sweat to prove
1782,SIR PETER.,All this I know so well; but you have read
1783,SIR PETER.,The siege of Troy?
1784,SIR PETER.,
1785,SIR LAMBERT.,SIR LAMBERT.
1786,SIR LAMBERT.,
1787,SIR LAMBERT.,"O! yea, I know it well."
1788,SIR LAMBERT.,
1789,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1790,SIR PETER.,
1791,SIR PETER.,"There! they were wrong, as wrong as men could be"
1792,SIR PETER.,"For, as I think, they found it such delight"
1793,SIR PETER.,To see fair Helen going through their town;
1794,SIR PETER.,"Yea, any little common thing she did"
1795,SIR PETER.,"(As stooping to pick a flower) seem'd so strange,"
1796,SIR PETER.,"So new in its great beauty, that they said:"
1797,SIR PETER.,"Here we will keep her living in this town,"
1798,SIR PETER.,"Till all burns up together. And so, fought,"
1799,SIR PETER.,In a mad whirl of knowing they were wrong;
1800,SIR PETER.,"Yea, they fought well, and ever, like a man"
1801,SIR PETER.,"That hangs legs off the ground by both his hands,"
1802,SIR PETER.,"Over some great height, did they struggle sore,"
1803,SIR PETER.,"Quite sure to slip at last; wherefore, take note"
1804,SIR PETER.,"How almost all men, reading that sad siege,"
1805,SIR PETER.,"Hold for the Trojans; as I did at least,"
1806,SIR PETER.,Thought Hector the best knight a long way:
1807,SIR PETER.,Now
1808,SIR PETER.,Why should I not do this thing that I think;
1809,SIR PETER.,"For even when I come to count the gains,"
1810,SIR PETER.,"I have them my side: men will talk, you know"
1811,SIR PETER.,"(We talk of Hector, dead so long agone,)"
1812,SIR PETER.,"When I am dead, of how this Peter clung"
1813,SIR PETER.,"To what he thought the right; of how he died,"
1814,SIR PETER.,"Perchance, at last, doing some desperate deed"
1815,SIR PETER.,"Few men would care do now, and this is gain"
1816,SIR PETER.,"To me, as ease and money is to you."
1817,SIR PETER.,"Moreover, too, I like the straining game"
1818,SIR PETER.,Of striving well to hold up things that fall;
1819,SIR PETER.,So one becomes great. See you! in good times
1820,SIR PETER.,"All men live well together, and you, too,"
1821,SIR PETER.,"Live dull and happy: happy? not so quick,"
1822,SIR PETER.,Suppose sharp thoughts begin to burn you up?
1823,SIR PETER.,"Why then, but just to fight as I do now,"
1824,SIR PETER.,"A halter round my neck, would be great bliss."
1825,SIR PETER.,O! I am well off.                            [_Aside._
1826,SIR PETER.,"Talk, and talk, and talk,"
1827,SIR PETER.,"I know this man has come to murder me,"
1828,SIR PETER.,And yet I talk still.
1829,SIR PETER.,
1830,SIR LAMBERT.,SIR LAMBERT.
1831,SIR LAMBERT.,
1832,SIR LAMBERT.,"If your side were right,"
1833,SIR LAMBERT.,"You might be, though you lost; but if I said,"
1834,SIR LAMBERT.,"'You are a traitor, being, as you are,"
1835,SIR LAMBERT.,"Born Frenchman.' What are Edwards unto you,"
1836,SIR LAMBERT.,Or Richards?
1837,SIR LAMBERT.,
1838,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1839,SIR PETER.,
1840,SIR PETER.,"Nay, hold there, my Lambert, hold!"
1841,SIR PETER.,"For fear your zeal should bring you to some harm,"
1842,SIR PETER.,Don't call me traitor.
1843,SIR PETER.,
1844,SIR LAMBERT.,SIR LAMBERT.
1845,SIR LAMBERT.,
1846,SIR LAMBERT.,"Furthermore, my knight,"
1847,SIR LAMBERT.,"Men call you slippery on your losing side,"
1848,SIR LAMBERT.,"When at Bordeaux I was ambassador,"
1849,SIR LAMBERT.,"I heard them say so, and could scarce say: Nay."
1850,SIR LAMBERT.,[_He takes hold of something in
1851,SIR LAMBERT.,"his sleeve, and rises._"
1852,SIR LAMBERT.,
1853,SIR LAMBERT.,"SIR PETER, _rising_."
1854,SIR LAMBERT.,

1860,SIR LAMBERT.,
1861,SIR LAMBERT.,"Nay, liar in your teeth!"

1867,SIR LAMBERT.,"How thief! thief! thief! so there, fair thief, so there,"
1868,SIR LAMBERT.,St. George Guienne! glaives for the castellan!
1869,SIR LAMBERT.,"You French, you are but dead, unless you lay"

1881,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1882,SIR PETER.,
1883,SIR PETER.,"Why, put them all to ransom, those that can"
1884,SIR PETER.,"Pay anything, but not too light though, John,"
1885,SIR PETER.,Seeing we have them on the hip: for those
1886,SIR PETER.,"That have no money, that being certified,"
1887,SIR PETER.,"Why, turn them out of doors before they spy;"
1888,SIR PETER.,But bring Sir Lambert guarded unto me.
1889,SIR PETER.,
1890,JOHN CURZON.,JOHN CURZON.
1891,JOHN CURZON.,

1900,SIR PETER.,"Now, Sir Lambert, now!"

1904,SIR LAMBERT.,SIR LAMBERT.
1905,SIR LAMBERT.,
1906,SIR LAMBERT.,Cousin! cousin! think!
1907,SIR LAMBERT.,I am your own blood; may God pardon me!
1908,SIR LAMBERT.,"I am not fit to die; if you knew all,"
1909,SIR LAMBERT.,All I have done since I was young and good.
1910,SIR LAMBERT.,"O! you would give me yet another chance,"
1911,SIR LAMBERT.,"As God would, that I might wash all clear out,"
1912,SIR LAMBERT.,By serving you and Him. Let me go now!
1913,SIR LAMBERT.,And I will pay you down more golden crowns

1915,SIR LAMBERT.,
1916,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1917,SIR PETER.,
1918,SIR PETER.,"Well, stand back,"
1919,SIR PETER.,"And do not touch me! No, you shall not die,"
1920,SIR PETER.,"Nor yet pay ransom. You, John Curzon, cause"
1921,SIR PETER.,"Some carpenters to build a scaffold, high,"
1922,SIR PETER.,"Outside the gate; when it is built, sound out"
1923,SIR PETER.,"To all good folks, 'Come, see a traitor punish'd!'"
1924,SIR PETER.,"Take me my knight, and set him up thereon,"
1925,SIR PETER.,"And let the hangman shave his head quite clean,"

1938,SIR LAMBERT.,
1939,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1940,SIR PETER.,
1941,SIR PETER.,Say her name
1942,SIR PETER.,"Again, and you are dead, slain here by me."
1943,SIR PETER.,"Why should I talk with you? I'm master here,"
1944,SIR PETER.,And do not want your schooling; is it not
1945,SIR PETER.,My mercy that you are not dangling dead
1946,SIR PETER.,There in the gateway with a broken neck?
1947,SIR PETER.,
1948,SIR LAMBERT.,SIR LAMBERT.
1949,SIR LAMBERT.,
1950,SIR LAMBERT.,Such mercy! why not kill me then outright?

1962,SIR PETER.,"Hold, John!      [_To_ Lambert."
1963,SIR PETER.,"That's your choice,"
1964,SIR PETER.,"To die, mind! Then you shall die: Lambert mine,"
1965,SIR PETER.,"I thank you now for choosing this so well,"
1966,SIR PETER.,It saves me much perplexity and doubt;
1967,SIR PETER.,"Perchance an ill deed too, for half I count"
1968,SIR PETER.,This sparing traitors is an ill deed.
1969,SIR PETER.,"Well,"
1970,SIR PETER.,"Lambert, die bravely, and we're almost friends."
1971,SIR PETER.,
1972,SIR PETER.,"SIR LAMBERT, _grovelling_."

1976,SIR PETER.,I will not die.
1977,SIR PETER.,
1978,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
1979,SIR PETER.,
1980,SIR PETER.,"Why, what is this I see?"
1981,SIR PETER.,"A man who is a knight, and bandied words"
1982,SIR PETER.,"So well just now with me, is lying down,"
1983,SIR PETER.,"Gone mad for fear like this! So, so, you thought"
1984,SIR PETER.,"You knew the worst, and might say what you pleased."
1985,SIR PETER.,I should have guess'd this from a man like you.
1986,SIR PETER.,"Eh! righteous Job would give up skin for skin,"
1987,SIR PETER.,"Yea, all a man can have for simple life,"
1988,SIR PETER.,"And we talk fine, yea, even a hound like this,"
1989,SIR PETER.,"Who needs must know that when he dies, deep hell"
1990,SIR PETER.,"Will hold him fast for ever, so fine we talk,"
1991,SIR PETER.,"'Would rather die,' all that. Now sir, get up!"
1992,SIR PETER.,"And choose again: shall it be head sans ears,"
1993,SIR PETER.,Or trunk sans head?
1994,SIR PETER.,"John Curzon, pull him up!"
1995,SIR PETER.,"What, life then? go and build the scaffold, John."
1996,SIR PETER.,"Lambert, I hope that never on this earth"
1997,SIR PETER.,"We meet again; that you'll turn out a monk,"
1998,SIR PETER.,"And mend the life I give you, so farewell,"
1999,SIR PETER.,"I'm sorry you're a rascal. John, despatch."

2018,GUESCLIN.,"I cannot say I hate you, yet my oath,"

2020,GUESCLIN.,
2021,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
2022,SIR PETER.,
2023,SIR PETER.,"I knew you could not hate me, therefore I"

2029,SIR PETER.,"Although hot lead runs through me for my blood,"
2030,SIR PETER.,"All this falls cold as though I said, Sweet lords,"
2031,SIR PETER.,Give back my falcon!
2032,SIR PETER.,"See how young I am,"
2033,SIR PETER.,"Do you care altogether more for France,"
2034,SIR PETER.,"Say rather one French faction, than for all"
2035,SIR PETER.,"The state of Christendom? a gallant knight,"
2036,SIR PETER.,"As (yea, by God!) I have been, is more worth"
2037,SIR PETER.,"Than many castles; will you bring this death,"
2038,SIR PETER.,"For a mere act of justice, on my head?"
2039,SIR PETER.,
2040,SIR PETER.,"Think how it ends all, death! all other things"
2041,SIR PETER.,"Can somehow be retrieved, yea, send me forth"
2042,SIR PETER.,"Naked and maimed, rather than slay me here;"
2043,SIR PETER.,"Then somehow will I get me other clothes,"
2044,SIR PETER.,"And somehow will I get me some poor horse,"
2045,SIR PETER.,"And, somehow clad in poor old rusty arms,"
2046,SIR PETER.,"Will ride and smite among the serried glaives,"
2047,SIR PETER.,"Fear not death so; for I can tilt right well,"
2048,SIR PETER.,"Let me not say I could; I know all tricks,"
2049,SIR PETER.,"That sway the sharp sword cunningly; ah you,"
2050,SIR PETER.,"You, my Lord Clisson, in the other days"
2051,SIR PETER.,"Have seen me learning these, yea, call to mind,"

2057,CLISSON.,CLISSON.
2058,CLISSON.,
2059,CLISSON.,"Nay, this is pitiful, to see him die."
2060,CLISSON.,"My Lord the Constable, I pray you note"
2061,CLISSON.,That you are losing some few thousand crowns
2062,CLISSON.,By slaying this man; also think: his lands
2063,CLISSON.,"Along the Garonne river lie for leagues,"
2064,CLISSON.,"And are right rich, a many mills he has,"
2065,CLISSON.,Three abbeys of grey monks do hold of him:
2066,CLISSON.,"Though wishing well for Clement, as we do,"
2067,CLISSON.,"I know the next heir, his old uncle, well,"
2068,CLISSON.,Who does not care two deniers for the knight
2069,CLISSON.,"As things go now, but slay him, and then see,"
2070,CLISSON.,"How he will bristle up like any perch,"
2071,CLISSON.,"With curves of spears. What! do not doubt, my lord,"
2072,CLISSON.,"You'll get the money, this man saved my life,"
2073,CLISSON.,And I will buy him for two thousand crowns;
2074,CLISSON.,"Well, five then: eh! what! No again? well then,"

2085,GUESCLIN.,"SIR LAMBERT, _coming forward_."
2086,GUESCLIN.,
2087,GUESCLIN.,"Music, do you know,"
2088,GUESCLIN.,"Music will suit you well, I think, because"
2089,GUESCLIN.,"You look so mild, like Laurence being grill'd;"
2090,GUESCLIN.,"Or perhaps music soft and slow, because"
2091,GUESCLIN.,"This is high day of triumph unto me,"
2092,GUESCLIN.,"Is it not, Peter?"
2093,GUESCLIN.,"You are frighten'd, though,"
2094,GUESCLIN.,"Eh! you are pale, because this hurts you much,"
2095,GUESCLIN.,"Whose life was pleasant to you, not like mine,"
2096,GUESCLIN.,"You ruin'd wretch! Men mock me in the streets,"
2097,GUESCLIN.,"Only in whispers loud, because I am"
2098,GUESCLIN.,"Friend of the constable; will this please you,"
2099,GUESCLIN.,"Unhappy Peter? once a-going home,"
2100,GUESCLIN.,"Without my servants, and a little drunk,"
2101,GUESCLIN.,At midnight through the lone dim lamp-lit streets.
2102,GUESCLIN.,"A whore came up and spat into my eyes,"
2103,GUESCLIN.,"Rather to blind me than to make me see,"
2104,GUESCLIN.,"But she was very drunk, and tottering back,"
2105,GUESCLIN.,Even in the middle of her laughter fell
2106,GUESCLIN.,"And cut her head against the pointed stones,"
2107,GUESCLIN.,"While I lean'd on my staff, and look'd at her,"
2108,GUESCLIN.,"And cried, being drunk."
2109,GUESCLIN.,Girls would not spit at you.
2110,GUESCLIN.,"You are so handsome, I think verily"
2111,GUESCLIN.,"Most ladies would be glad to kiss your eyes,"
2112,GUESCLIN.,And yet you will be hung like a cur dog
2113,GUESCLIN.,"Five minutes hence, and grow black in the face,"
2114,GUESCLIN.,And curl your toes up. Therefore I am glad.
2115,GUESCLIN.,
2116,GUESCLIN.,"Guess why I stand and talk this nonsense now,"
2117,GUESCLIN.,"With Guesclin getting ready to play chess,"
2118,GUESCLIN.,"And Clisson doing something with his sword,"
2119,GUESCLIN.,"I can't see what, talking to Guesclin though,"
2120,GUESCLIN.,"I don't know what about, perhaps of you."
2121,GUESCLIN.,"But, cousin Peter, while I stroke your beard,"
2122,GUESCLIN.,"Let me say this, I'd like to tell you now"
2123,GUESCLIN.,"That your life hung upon a game of chess,"
2124,GUESCLIN.,"That if, say, my squire Robert here should beat,"
2125,GUESCLIN.,"Why you should live, but hang if I beat him;"
2126,GUESCLIN.,"Then guess, clever Peter, what I should do then:"
2127,GUESCLIN.,"Well, give it up? why, Peter, I should let"
2128,GUESCLIN.,"My squire Robert beat me, then you would think"
2129,GUESCLIN.,"That you were safe, you know; Eh? not at all,"
2130,GUESCLIN.,"But I should keep you three days in some hold,"
2131,GUESCLIN.,"Giving you salt to eat, which would be kind,"
2132,GUESCLIN.,Considering the tax there is on salt;
2133,GUESCLIN.,"And afterwards should let you go, perhaps?"
2134,GUESCLIN.,"No I should not, but I should hang you, sir,"
2135,GUESCLIN.,With a red rope in lieu of mere grey rope.
2136,GUESCLIN.,
2137,GUESCLIN.,"But I forgot, you have not told me yet"
2138,GUESCLIN.,"If you can guess why I talk nonsense thus,"
2139,GUESCLIN.,Instead of drinking wine while you are hang'd?
2140,GUESCLIN.,"You are not quick at guessing, give it up."
2141,GUESCLIN.,"This is the reason; here I hold your hand,"
2142,GUESCLIN.,"And watch you growing paler, see you writhe"
2143,GUESCLIN.,"And this, my Peter, is a joy so dear,"
2144,GUESCLIN.,I cannot by all striving tell you how
2145,GUESCLIN.,"I love it, nor I think, good man, would you"
2146,GUESCLIN.,Quite understand my great delight therein;
2147,GUESCLIN.,"You, when you had me underneath you once,"
2148,GUESCLIN.,"Spat as it were, and said, 'Go take him out,'"
2149,GUESCLIN.,"That they might do that thing to me whereat,"
2150,GUESCLIN.,"E'en now this long time off I could well shriek,"
2151,GUESCLIN.,"And then you tried forget I ever lived,"
2152,GUESCLIN.,And sunk your hating into other things;
2153,GUESCLIN.,"While I: St. Denis! though, I think you'll faint,"
2154,GUESCLIN.,"Your lips are grey so; yes, you will, unless"
2155,GUESCLIN.,You let it out and weep like a hurt child;
2156,GUESCLIN.,"Hurrah! you do now. Do not go just yet,"
2157,GUESCLIN.,"For I am Alice, am right like her now,"
2158,GUESCLIN.,"Will you not kiss me on the lips, my love?"
2159,GUESCLIN.,
2160,CLISSON.,CLISSON.
2161,CLISSON.,
2162,CLISSON.,"You filthy beast, stand back and let him go,"
2163,CLISSON.,Or by God's eyes I'll choke you!
2164,CLISSON.,[_Kneeling to_ Sir Peter.
2165,CLISSON.,Fair sir knight
2166,CLISSON.,I kneel upon my knees and pray to you
2167,CLISSON.,That you would pardon me for this your death;
2168,CLISSON.,"God knows how much I wish you still alive,"
2169,CLISSON.,Also how heartily I strove to save
2170,CLISSON.,"Your life at this time; yea, he knows quite well,"
2171,CLISSON.,"(I swear it, so forgive me!) how I would,"
2172,CLISSON.,"If it were possible, give up my life"
2173,CLISSON.,"Upon this grass for yours; fair knight, although,"
2174,CLISSON.,"He knowing all things knows this thing too, well,"
2175,CLISSON.,"Yet when you see his face some short time hence,"
2176,CLISSON.,Tell him I tried to save you.
2177,CLISSON.,
2178,SIR PETER.,SIR PETER.
2179,SIR PETER.,
2180,SIR PETER.,"O! my lord,"
2181,SIR PETER.,"I cannot say this is as good as life,"
2182,SIR PETER.,"But yet it makes me feel far happier now,"
2183,SIR PETER.,"And if at all, after a thousand years,"
2184,SIR PETER.,"I see God's face, I will speak loud and bold,"
2185,SIR PETER.,"And tell Him you were kind, and like Himself;"
2186,SIR PETER.,"Sir, may God bless you!"
2187,SIR PETER.,Did you note how I
2188,SIR PETER.,"Fell weeping just now? pray you, do not think"
2189,SIR PETER.,"That Lambert's taunts did this, I hardly heard"
2190,SIR PETER.,"The base things that he said, being deep in thought"
2191,SIR PETER.,Of all things that have happen'd since I was
2192,SIR PETER.,A little child; and so at last I thought
2193,SIR PETER.,"Of my true lady: truly, sir, it seem'd"
2194,SIR PETER.,"No longer gone than yesterday, that this"
2195,SIR PETER.,Was the sole reason God let me be born
2196,SIR PETER.,"Twenty-five years ago, that I might love"
2197,SIR PETER.,"Her, my sweet lady, and be loved by her;"
2198,SIR PETER.,"This seem'd so yesterday, to-day death comes,"
2199,SIR PETER.,"And is so bitter strong, I cannot see"
2200,SIR PETER.,Why I was born.
2201,SIR PETER.,"But as a last request,"
2202,SIR PETER.,"I pray you, O kind Clisson, send some man,"
2203,SIR PETER.,"Some good man, mind you, to say how I died,"
2204,SIR PETER.,"And take my last love to her: fare-you-well,"
2205,SIR PETER.,"And may God keep you; I must go now, lest"
2206,SIR PETER.,I grow too sick with thinking on these things;
2207,SIR PETER.,"Likewise my feet are wearied of the earth,"
2208,SIR PETER.,From whence I shall be lifted upright soon.
2209,SIR PETER.,[_As he goes._
2210,SIR PETER.,"Ah me! shamed too, I wept at fear of death;"
2211,SIR PETER.,"And yet not so, I only wept because"
2212,SIR PETER.,There was no beautiful lady to kiss me
2213,SIR PETER.,"Before I died, and sweetly wish good speed"
2214,SIR PETER.,"From her dear lips. O for some lady, though"
2215,SIR PETER.,"I saw her ne'er before; Alice, my love,"
2216,SIR PETER.,"I do not ask for; Clisson was right kind,"
2217,SIR PETER.,"If he had been a woman, I should die"
2218,SIR PETER.,"Without this sickness: but I am all wrong,"
2219,SIR PETER.,"So wrong, and hopelessly afraid to die."
2220,SIR PETER.,"There, I will go."
2221,SIR PETER.,"My God! how sick I am,"
2222,SIR PETER.,If only she could come and kiss me now.
2223,SIR PETER.,
2224,SIR PETER.,
2225,SIR PETER.,"_The Hotel de la Barde, Bordeaux._"

2228,SIR PETER.,
2229,SIR PETER.,"No news yet! surely, still he holds his own:"
2230,SIR PETER.,That garde stands well; I mind me passing it
2231,SIR PETER.,Some months ago; God grant the walls are strong!
2232,SIR PETER.,"I heard some knights say something yestereve,"
2233,SIR PETER.,I tried hard to forget: words far apart
2234,SIR PETER.,Struck on my heart something like this; one said:
2235,SIR PETER.,"What eh! a Gascon with an English name,"
2236,SIR PETER.,"Harpdon? then nought, but afterwards: Poictou."
2237,SIR PETER.,"As one who answers to a question ask'd,"
2238,SIR PETER.,"Then carelessly regretful came: No, no."
2239,SIR PETER.,"Whereto in answer loud and eagerly,"
2240,SIR PETER.,"One said: Impossible? Christ, what foul play!"
2241,SIR PETER.,And went off angrily; and while thenceforth
2242,SIR PETER.,"I hurried gaspingly afraid, I heard:"
2243,SIR PETER.,Guesclin; Five thousand men-at-arms; Clisson.
2244,SIR PETER.,My heart misgives me it is all in vain
2245,SIR PETER.,I send these succours; and in good time there
2246,SIR PETER.,"Their trumpet sounds: ah! here they are; good knights,"
2247,SIR PETER.,God up in Heaven keep you.
2248,SIR PETER.,If they come
2249,SIR PETER.,"And find him prisoner, for I can't believe"
2250,SIR PETER.,"Guesclin will slay him, even though they storm."
2251,SIR PETER.,The last horse turns the corner.
2252,SIR PETER.,God in Heaven!
2253,SIR PETER.,What have I got to thinking of at last!
2254,SIR PETER.,"That thief I will not name is with Guesclin,"
2255,SIR PETER.,Who loves him for his lands. My love! my love!
2256,SIR PETER.,"O, if I lose you after all the past,"
2257,SIR PETER.,What shall I do?
2258,SIR PETER.,I cannot bear the noise
2259,SIR PETER.,"And light street out there, with this thought alive,"
2260,SIR PETER.,Like any curling snake within my brain;
2261,SIR PETER.,Let me just hide my head within these soft
2262,SIR PETER.,"Deep cushions, there to try and think it out."
2263,SIR PETER.,[_Lying in the window-seat._
2264,SIR PETER.,"I cannot hear much noise now, and I think"
2265,SIR PETER.,That I shall go to sleep: it all sounds dim
2266,SIR PETER.,"And faint, and I shall soon forget most things;"
2267,SIR PETER.,"Yea, almost that I am alive and here;"
2268,SIR PETER.,"It goes slow, comes slow, like a big mill-wheel"
2269,SIR PETER.,"On some broad stream, with long green weeds a-sway,"
2270,SIR PETER.,"And soft and slow it rises and it falls,"
2271,SIR PETER.,Still going onward.
2272,SIR PETER.,"Lying so, one kiss,"
2273,SIR PETER.,"And I should be in Avalon asleep,"
2274,SIR PETER.,"Among the poppies, and the yellow flowers;"
2275,SIR PETER.,"And they should brush my cheek, my hair being spread"
2276,SIR PETER.,Far out among the stems; soft mice and small
2277,SIR PETER.,"Eating and creeping all about my feet,"
2278,SIR PETER.,Red shod and tired; and the flies should come
2279,SIR PETER.,Creeping o'er my broad eyelids unafraid;
2280,SIR PETER.,"And there should be a noise of water going,"
2281,SIR PETER.,"Clear blue fresh water breaking on the slates,"
2282,SIR PETER.,Likewise the flies should creep: God's eyes! God help!
2283,SIR PETER.,"A trumpet? I will run fast, leap adown"
2284,SIR PETER.,"The slippery sea-stairs, where the crabs fight."
2285,SIR PETER.,Ah!
2286,SIR PETER.,"I was half dreaming, but the trumpet's true;"
2287,SIR PETER.,He stops here at our house. The Clisson arms?
2288,SIR PETER.,"Ah, now for news. But I must hold my heart,"
2289,SIR PETER.,And be quite gentle till he is gone out;
2290,SIR PETER.,"And afterwards: but he is still alive,"
2291,SIR PETER.,He must be still alive.
2292,SIR PETER.,
2293,SIR PETER.,_Enter a_ Squire _of_ Clisson's.
2294,SIR PETER.,
2295,SIR PETER.,"Good day, fair sir,"
2296,SIR PETER.,"I give you welcome, knowing whence you come."
2297,SIR PETER.,
2298,SQUIRE.,SQUIRE.
2299,SQUIRE.,
2300,SQUIRE.,"My Lady Alice de la Barde, I come"
2301,SQUIRE.,"From Oliver Clisson, knight and mighty lord,"
2302,SQUIRE.,Bringing you tidings: I make bold to hope
2303,SQUIRE.,"You will not count me villain, even if"
2304,SQUIRE.,"They wring your heart, nor hold me still in hate;"
2305,SQUIRE.,"For I am but a mouthpiece after all,"
2306,SQUIRE.,"A mouthpiece, too, of one who wishes well"
2307,SQUIRE.,To you and your's.
2308,SQUIRE.,
2309,ALICE.,ALICE.
2310,ALICE.,
2311,ALICE.,"Can you talk faster, sir,"
2312,ALICE.,Get over all this quicker? fix your eyes
2313,ALICE.,"On mine, I pray you, and whate'er you see,"
2314,ALICE.,"Still go on talking fast, unless I fall,"
2315,ALICE.,Or bid you stop.
2316,ALICE.,
2317,SQUIRE.,SQUIRE.
2318,SQUIRE.,
2319,SQUIRE.,"I pray your pardon then,"
2320,SQUIRE.,"And, looking in your eyes, fair lady, say"
2321,SQUIRE.,I am unhappy that your knight is dead.
2322,SQUIRE.,"Take heart, and listen! let me tell you all."
2323,SQUIRE.,"We were five thousand goodly men-at-arms,"
2324,SQUIRE.,And scant five hundred had he in that hold:
2325,SQUIRE.,"His rotten sand-stone walls were wet with rain,"
2326,SQUIRE.,And fell in lumps wherever a stone hit;
2327,SQUIRE.,Yet for three days about the barrier there
2328,SQUIRE.,"The deadly glaives were gather'd, laid across,"
2329,SQUIRE.,And push'd and pull'd; the fourth our engines came;
2330,SQUIRE.,"But still amid the crash of falling walls,"
2331,SQUIRE.,"And roar of lombards, rattle of hard bolts,"
2332,SQUIRE.,"The steady bow-strings flash'd, and still stream'd out"
2333,SQUIRE.,"St. George's banner, and the seven swords,"
2334,SQUIRE.,And still they cried: St. George Guienne! until
2335,SQUIRE.,"Their walls were flat as Jericho's of old,"
2336,SQUIRE.,"And our rush came, and cut them from the keep."
2337,SQUIRE.,
2338,ALICE.,ALICE.
2339,ALICE.,
2340,ALICE.,"Stop, sir, and tell me if you slew him then,"
2341,ALICE.,"And where he died, if you can really mean"
2342,ALICE.,"That Peter Harpdon, the good knight, is dead?"
2343,ALICE.,
2344,SQUIRE.,SQUIRE.
2345,SQUIRE.,
2346,SQUIRE.,"Fair lady, in the base-court:"
2347,SQUIRE.,
2348,ALICE.,ALICE.
2349,ALICE.,
2350,ALICE.,What base-court?
2351,ALICE.,"What do you talk of? Nay, go on, go on;"
2352,ALICE.,'Twas only something gone within my head:
2353,ALICE.,"Do you not know, one turns one's head round quick,"
2354,ALICE.,"And something cracks there with sore pain? go on,"
2355,ALICE.,And still look at my eyes.
2356,ALICE.,
2357,SQUIRE.,SQUIRE.
2358,SQUIRE.,
2359,SQUIRE.,"Almost alone,"
2360,SQUIRE.,"There in the base-court fought he with his sword,"
2361,SQUIRE.,"Using his left hand much, more than the wont"
2362,SQUIRE.,"Of most knights now-a-days; our men gave back,"
2363,SQUIRE.,"For wheresoever he hit a downright blow,"
2364,SQUIRE.,"Some one fell bleeding, for no plate could hold"
2365,SQUIRE.,Against the sway of body and great arm;
2366,SQUIRE.,"Till he grew tired, and some man (no! not I,"
2367,SQUIRE.,"I swear not I, fair lady, as I live!)"
2368,SQUIRE.,"Thrust at him with a glaive between the knees,"
2369,SQUIRE.,"And threw him; down he fell, sword undermost;"
2370,SQUIRE.,"Many fell on him, crying out their cries,"
2371,SQUIRE.,"Tore his sword from him, tore his helm off, and:"
2372,SQUIRE.,
2373,ALICE.,ALICE.
2374,ALICE.,
2375,ALICE.,"Yea, slew him: I am much too young to live,"
2376,ALICE.,"Fair God, so let me die!"
2377,ALICE.,"You have done well,"
2378,ALICE.,"Done all your message gently, pray you go,"
2379,ALICE.,"Our knights will make you cheer; moreover, take"
2380,ALICE.,This bag of franks for your expenses.
2381,ALICE.,[_The Squire kneels._
2382,ALICE.,But
2383,ALICE.,"You do not go; still looking at my face,"
2384,ALICE.,"You kneel! what, squire, do you mock me then?"
2385,ALICE.,"You need not tell me who has set you on,"
2386,ALICE.,"But tell me only, 'tis a made-up tale."
2387,ALICE.,You are some lover may-be or his friend;
2388,ALICE.,"Sir, if you loved me once, or your friend loved,"
2389,ALICE.,"Think, is it not enough that I kneel down"
2390,ALICE.,And kiss your feet? your jest will be right good
2391,ALICE.,"If you give in now; carry it too far,"
2392,ALICE.,And 'twill be cruel: not yet? but you weep
2393,ALICE.,"Almost, as though you loved me; love me then,"
2394,ALICE.,"And go to Heaven by telling all your sport,"
2395,ALICE.,"And I will kiss you then with all my heart,"
2396,ALICE.,Upon the mouth: O! what can I do then
2397,ALICE.,To move you?
2398,ALICE.,
2399,SQUIRE.,SQUIRE.
2400,SQUIRE.,
2401,SQUIRE.,"Lady fair, forgive me still!"
2402,SQUIRE.,"You know I am so sorry, but my tale"
2403,SQUIRE.,Is not yet finish'd:
2404,SQUIRE.,"So they bound his hands,"
2405,SQUIRE.,"And brought him tall and pale to Guesclin's tent,"
2406,SQUIRE.,"Who, seeing him, leant his head upon his hand,"
2407,SQUIRE.,"And ponder'd somewhile, afterwards, looking up:"
2408,SQUIRE.,"Fair dame, what shall I say?"
2409,SQUIRE.,
2410,ALICE.,ALICE.
2411,ALICE.,
2412,ALICE.,"Yea, I know now,"
2413,ALICE.,"Good squire, you may go now with my thanks."
2414,ALICE.,
2415,SQUIRE.,SQUIRE.
2416,SQUIRE.,
2417,SQUIRE.,"Yet, lady, for your own sake I say this,"
2418,SQUIRE.,"Yea, for my own sake, too, and Clisson's sake."
2419,SQUIRE.,"When Guesclin told him he must be hanged soon,"
2420,SQUIRE.,Within a while he lifted up his head
2421,SQUIRE.,"And spoke for his own life; not crouching, though,"
2422,SQUIRE.,"As abjectly afraid to die, nor yet"
2423,SQUIRE.,"Sullenly brave as many a thief will die,"
2424,SQUIRE.,Nor yet as one that plays at japes with God:
2425,SQUIRE.,Few words he spoke; not so much what he said
2426,SQUIRE.,"Moved us, I think, as, saying it, there played"
2427,SQUIRE.,Strange tenderness from that big soldier there
2428,SQUIRE.,About his pleading; eagerness to live
2429,SQUIRE.,"Because folk loved him, and he loved them back,"
2430,SQUIRE.,And many gallant plans unfinish'd now
2431,SQUIRE.,"For ever. Clisson's heart, which may God bless!"
2432,SQUIRE.,"Was moved to pray for him, but all in vain;"
2433,SQUIRE.,Wherefore I bring this message:
2434,SQUIRE.,"That he waits,"
2435,SQUIRE.,"Still loving you, within the little church"
2436,SQUIRE.,"Whose windows, with the one eye of the light"
2437,SQUIRE.,"Over the altar, every night behold"
2438,SQUIRE.,The great dim broken walls he strove to keep!
2439,SQUIRE.,
2440,SQUIRE.,There my Lord Clisson did his burial well.
2441,SQUIRE.,"Now, lady, I will go: God give you rest!"
2442,SQUIRE.,
2443,ALICE.,ALICE.
2444,ALICE.,
2445,ALICE.,"Thank Clisson from me, squire, and farewell!"
2446,ALICE.,And now to keep myself from going mad.
2447,ALICE.,"Christ! I have been a many times to church,"
2448,ALICE.,"And, ever since my mother taught me prayers,"
2449,ALICE.,"Have used them daily, but to-day I wish"
2450,ALICE.,"To pray another way; come face to face,"
2451,ALICE.,"O Christ, that I may clasp your knees and pray"
2452,ALICE.,I know not what; at any rate come now
2453,ALICE.,"From one of many places where you are,"
2454,ALICE.,"Either in Heaven amid thick angel wings,"
2455,ALICE.,"Or sitting on the altar strange with gems,"
2456,ALICE.,Or high up in the duskness of the apse;
2457,ALICE.,"Let us go, You and I, a long way off,"
2458,ALICE.,"To the little damp, dark, Poitevin church."
2459,ALICE.,"While you sit on the coffin in the dark,"
2460,ALICE.,"Will I lie down, my face on the bare stone"
2461,ALICE.,"Between your feet, and chatter anything"
2462,ALICE.,I have heard long ago. What matters it
2463,ALICE.,"So I may keep you there, your solemn face"
2464,ALICE.,"And long hair even-flowing on each side,"
2465,ALICE.,"Until you love me well enough to speak,"
2466,ALICE.,"And give me comfort? yea, till o'er your chin,"
2467,ALICE.,And cloven red beard the great tears roll down
2468,ALICE.,"In pity for my misery, and I die,"
2469,ALICE.,Kissed over by you.
2470,ALICE.,Eh Guesclin! if I were
2471,ALICE.,"Like Countess Mountfort now, that kiss'd the knight,"
2472,ALICE.,Across the salt sea come to fight for her:
2473,ALICE.,"Ah! just to go about with many knights,"
2474,ALICE.,"Wherever you went, and somehow on one day,"
2475,ALICE.,"In a thick wood to catch you off your guard,"
2476,ALICE.,"Let you find, you and your some fifty friends,"
2477,ALICE.,"Nothing but arrows wheresoe'er you turn'd,"
2478,ALICE.,"Yea, and red crosses, great spears over them;"
2479,ALICE.,"And so, between a lane of my true men,"
2480,ALICE.,"To walk up pale and stern and tall, and with"
2481,ALICE.,"My arms on my surcoat, and his therewith,"
2482,ALICE.,"And then to make you kneel, O knight Guesclin;"
2483,ALICE.,"And then: alas! alas! when all is said,"
2484,ALICE.,"What could I do but let you go again,"
2485,ALICE.,"Being pitiful woman? I get no revenge,"
2486,ALICE.,Whatever happens; and I get no comfort:
2487,ALICE.,"I am but weak, and cannot move my feet,"
2488,ALICE.,But as men bid me.
2489,ALICE.,Strange I do not die.
2490,ALICE.,Suppose this has not happen'd after all?
2491,ALICE.,I will lean out again and watch for news.
2492,ALICE.,
2493,ALICE.,"I wonder how long I can still feel thus,"
2494,ALICE.,"As though I watch'd for news, feel as I did"
2495,ALICE.,"Just half-an-hour ago, before this news."
2496,ALICE.,"How all the street is humming, some men sing,"
2497,ALICE.,"And some men talk; some look up at the house,"
2498,ALICE.,Then lay their heads together and look grave:
2499,ALICE.,Their laughter pains me sorely in the heart;
2500,ALICE.,Their thoughtful talking makes my head turn round:
2501,ALICE.,"Yea, some men sing, what is it then they sing?"
2502,ALICE.,"Eh? Launcelot, and love and fate and death:"
2503,ALICE.,They ought to sing of him who was as wight
2504,ALICE.,"As Launcelot or Wade, and yet avail'd"
2505,ALICE.,"Just nothing, but to fail and fail and fail,"
2506,ALICE.,"And so at last to die and leave me here,"
2507,ALICE.,"Alone and wretched; yea, perhaps they will,"
2508,ALICE.,"When many years are past, make songs of us:"
2509,ALICE.,"God help me, though, truly I never thought"
2510,ALICE.,"That I should make a story in this way,"
2511,ALICE.,A story that his eyes can never see.
2512,ALICE.,
2513,ALICE.,[_One sings from outside._]
2514,ALICE.,
2515,ALICE.,_Therefore be it believed
2516,ALICE.,"Whatsoever he grieved,"
2517,ALICE.,"When his horse was relieved,"
2518,ALICE.,"This Launcelot,_"
2519,ALICE.,
2520,ALICE.,"_Beat down on his knee,"
2521,ALICE.,Right valiant was he
2522,ALICE.,"God's body to see,"
2523,ALICE.,Though he saw it not._
2524,ALICE.,
2525,ALICE.,"_Right valiant to move,"
2526,ALICE.,But for his sad love
2527,ALICE.,The high God above
2528,ALICE.,Stinted his praise._
2529,ALICE.,
2530,ALICE.,_Yet so he was glad
2531,ALICE.,"That his son, Lord Galahad,"
2532,ALICE.,That high joyaunce had
2533,ALICE.,All his life-days._
2534,ALICE.,
2535,ALICE.,_Sing we therefore then
2536,ALICE.,"Launcelot's praise again,"
2537,ALICE.,"For he wan crownés ten,"
2538,ALICE.,If he wan not twelve._
2539,ALICE.,
2540,ALICE.,_To his death from his birth
2541,ALICE.,"He was mickle of worth,"
2542,ALICE.,"Lay him in the cold earth,"
2543,ALICE.,A long grave ye may delve._
2544,ALICE.,
2545,ALICE.,_Omnes homines benedicite!

2695,RAPUNZEL.,
2696,RAPUNZEL.,Now some few fathoms from the place where I
2697,RAPUNZEL.,"Lay in the beech-wood, was a tower fair,"

2699,RAPUNZEL.,And dreamily I wonder'd what lived there:
2700,RAPUNZEL.,
2701,RAPUNZEL.,"Because it seem'd a dwelling for a queen,"
2702,RAPUNZEL.,No belfry for the swinging of great bells.
2703,RAPUNZEL.,No bolt or stone had ever crush'd the green
2704,RAPUNZEL.,"Shafts, amber and rose walls, no soot that tells"
2705,RAPUNZEL.,
2706,RAPUNZEL.,"Of the Norse torches burning up the roofs,"
2707,RAPUNZEL.,On the flower-carven marble could I see;
2708,RAPUNZEL.,But rather on all sides I saw the proofs
2709,RAPUNZEL.,Of a great loneliness that sicken'd me;

2711,RAPUNZEL.,"Making me feel a doubt that was not fear,"
2712,RAPUNZEL.,"Whether my whole life long had been a dream,"
2713,RAPUNZEL.,"And I should wake up soon in some place, where"
2714,RAPUNZEL.,The piled-up arms of the fighting angels gleam;
2715,RAPUNZEL.,
2716,RAPUNZEL.,"Not born as yet, but going to be born,"
2717,RAPUNZEL.,"No naked baby as I was at first,"
2718,RAPUNZEL.,"But an armed knight, whom fire, hate and scorn"
2719,RAPUNZEL.,Could turn from nothing: my heart almost burst
2720,RAPUNZEL.,
2721,RAPUNZEL.,"Beneath the beeches, as I lay a-dreaming,"
2722,RAPUNZEL.,"I tried so hard to read this riddle through,"
2723,RAPUNZEL.,To catch some golden cord that I saw gleaming
2724,RAPUNZEL.,Like gossamer against the autumn blue.
2725,RAPUNZEL.,
2726,RAPUNZEL.,"But while I ponder'd these things, from the wood"
2727,RAPUNZEL.,"There came a black-hair'd woman, tall and bold,"
2728,RAPUNZEL.,"Who strode straight up to where the tower stood,"
2729,RAPUNZEL.,"And cried out shrilly words, whereon behold--"
2730,RAPUNZEL.,
2731,RAPUNZEL.,"THE WITCH, _from the tower_."
2732,RAPUNZEL.,
2733,RAPUNZEL.,"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,"
2734,RAPUNZEL.,Let down your hair!
2735,RAPUNZEL.,
2736,THE PRINCE.,THE PRINCE.
2737,THE PRINCE.,
2738,THE PRINCE.,"Ah Christ! it was no dream then, but there stood"
2739,THE PRINCE.,"(She comes again) a maiden passing fair,"
2740,THE PRINCE.,"Against the roof, with face turn'd to the wood,"
2741,THE PRINCE.,Bearing within her arms waves of her yellow hair.
2742,THE PRINCE.,
2743,THE PRINCE.,"I read my riddle when I saw her stand,"
2744,THE PRINCE.,"Poor love! her face quite pale against her hair,"
2745,THE PRINCE.,Praying to all the leagues of empty land
2746,THE PRINCE.,To save her from the woe she suffer'd there.
2747,THE PRINCE.,
2748,THE PRINCE.,To think! they trod upon her golden hair
2749,THE PRINCE.,In the witches' sabbaths; it was a delight
2750,THE PRINCE.,"For these foul things, while she, with thin feet bare,"
2751,THE PRINCE.,"Stood on the roof upon the winter night,"
2752,THE PRINCE.,
2753,THE PRINCE.,"To plait her dear hair into many plaits,"
2754,THE PRINCE.,"And then, while God's eye look'd upon the thing,"
2755,THE PRINCE.,"In the very likenesses of Devil's bats,"
2756,THE PRINCE.,Upon the ends of her long hair to swing.
2757,THE PRINCE.,
2758,THE PRINCE.,"And now she stood above the parapet,"
2759,THE PRINCE.,"And, spreading out her arms, let her hair flow,"
2760,THE PRINCE.,Beneath that veil her smooth white forehead set
2761,THE PRINCE.,"Upon the marble, more I do not know;"
2762,THE PRINCE.,
2763,THE PRINCE.,Because before my eyes a film of gold
2764,THE PRINCE.,"Floated, as now it floats. O unknown love,"
2765,THE PRINCE.,"Would that I could thy yellow stair behold,"
2766,THE PRINCE.,If still thou standest the lead roof above!
2767,THE PRINCE.,
2768,THE PRINCE.,"THE WITCH, _as she passes_."
2769,THE PRINCE.,
2770,THE PRINCE.,Is there any who will dare
2771,THE PRINCE.,"To climb up the yellow stair,"
2772,THE PRINCE.,Glorious Rapunzel's golden hair?
2773,THE PRINCE.,
2774,THE PRINCE.,THE PRINCE.
2775,THE PRINCE.,
2776,THE PRINCE.,"If it would please God make you sing again,"
2777,THE PRINCE.,"I think that I might very sweetly die,"
2778,THE PRINCE.,"My soul somehow reach heaven in joyous pain,"
2779,THE PRINCE.,My heavy body on the beech-nuts lie.
2780,THE PRINCE.,
2781,THE PRINCE.,"Now I remember what a most strange year,"
2782,THE PRINCE.,"Most strange and awful, in the beechen wood"
2783,THE PRINCE.,I have pass'd now; I still have a faint fear
2784,THE PRINCE.,It is a kind of dream not understood.
2785,THE PRINCE.,
2786,THE PRINCE.,I have seen no one in this wood except
2787,THE PRINCE.,"The witch and her; have heard no human tones,"
2788,THE PRINCE.,But when the witches' revelry has crept
2789,THE PRINCE.,Between the very jointing of my bones.
2790,THE PRINCE.,
2791,THE PRINCE.,"Ah! I know now; I could not go away,"
2792,THE PRINCE.,But needs must stop to hear her sing that song
2793,THE PRINCE.,She always sings at dawning of the day.
2794,THE PRINCE.,"I am not happy here, for I am strong,"
2795,THE PRINCE.,
2796,THE PRINCE.,"And every morning do I whet my sword,"
2797,THE PRINCE.,"Yet Rapunzel still weeps within the tower,"
2798,THE PRINCE.,"And still God ties me down to the green sward,"
2799,THE PRINCE.,Because I cannot see the gold stair floating lower.
2800,THE PRINCE.,
2801,THE PRINCE.,RAPUNZEL _sings from the tower_.
2802,THE PRINCE.,
2803,THE PRINCE.,My mother taught me prayers
2804,THE PRINCE.,To say when I had need;
2805,THE PRINCE.,"I have so many cares,"
2806,THE PRINCE.,That I can take no heed
2807,THE PRINCE.,Of many words in them;
2808,THE PRINCE.,But I remember this:
2809,THE PRINCE.,"_Christ, bring me to thy bliss."
2810,THE PRINCE.,"Mary, maid withouten wem,"
2811,THE PRINCE.,"Keep me!_ I am lone, I wis,"
2812,THE PRINCE.,Yet besides I have made this
2813,THE PRINCE.,"By myself: _Give me a kiss,"
2814,THE PRINCE.,Dear God dwelling up in heaven!_
2815,THE PRINCE.,"Also: _Send me a true knight,"
2816,THE PRINCE.,"Lord Christ, with a steel sword, bright,"
2817,THE PRINCE.,"Broad, and trenchant; yea, and seven"
2818,THE PRINCE.,"Spans from hilt to point, O Lord!"
2819,THE PRINCE.,And let the handle of his sword
2820,THE PRINCE.,"Be gold on silver, Lord in heaven!"
2821,THE PRINCE.,Such a sword as I see gleam
2822,THE PRINCE.,"Sometimes, when they let me dream._"
2823,THE PRINCE.,
2824,THE PRINCE.,"Yea, besides, I have made this:"
2825,THE PRINCE.,"_Lord, give Mary a dear kiss,"
2826,THE PRINCE.,"And let gold Michael, who looked down,"
2827,THE PRINCE.,"When I was there, on Rouen town"
2828,THE PRINCE.,"From the spire, bring me that kiss"
2829,THE PRINCE.,On a lily! Lord do this!_
2830,THE PRINCE.,
2831,THE PRINCE.,"These prayers on the dreadful nights,"
2832,THE PRINCE.,"When the witches plait my hair,"
2833,THE PRINCE.,And the fearfullest of sights
2834,THE PRINCE.,"On the earth and in the air,"
2835,THE PRINCE.,"Will not let me close my eyes,"
2836,THE PRINCE.,"I murmur often, mix'd with sighs,"
2837,THE PRINCE.,That my weak heart will not hold
2838,THE PRINCE.,At some things that I behold.
2839,THE PRINCE.,"Nay, not sighs, but quiet groans,"
2840,THE PRINCE.,That swell out the little bones
2841,THE PRINCE.,Of my bosom; till a trance
2842,THE PRINCE.,"God sends in middle of that dance,"
2843,THE PRINCE.,And I behold the countenance
2844,THE PRINCE.,"Of Michael, and can feel no more"
2845,THE PRINCE.,The bitter east wind biting sore
2846,THE PRINCE.,My naked feet; can see no more
2847,THE PRINCE.,"The crayfish on the leaden floor,"
2848,THE PRINCE.,That mock with feeler and grim claw.
2849,THE PRINCE.,
2850,THE PRINCE.,"Yea, often in that happy trance,"
2851,THE PRINCE.,Beside the blessed countenance
2852,THE PRINCE.,"Of golden Michael, on the spire"
2853,THE PRINCE.,Glowing all crimson in the fire
2854,THE PRINCE.,"Of sunset, I behold a face,"
2855,THE PRINCE.,"Which sometime, if God give me grace,"
2856,THE PRINCE.,May kiss me in this very place.

2861,RAPUNZEL.,RAPUNZEL.
2862,RAPUNZEL.,
2863,RAPUNZEL.,It grows half way between the dark and light;
2864,RAPUNZEL.,"Love, we have been six hours here alone:"
2865,RAPUNZEL.,"I fear that she will come before the night,"
2866,RAPUNZEL.,And if she finds us thus we are undone.

2868,THE PRINCE.,THE PRINCE.
2869,THE PRINCE.,
2870,THE PRINCE.,"Nay, draw a little nearer, that your breath"
2871,THE PRINCE.,"May touch my lips, let my cheek feel your arm;"

2874,THE PRINCE.,
2875,RAPUNZEL.,RAPUNZEL.
2876,RAPUNZEL.,
2877,RAPUNZEL.,"Once came two knights and fought with swords below,"
2878,RAPUNZEL.,"And while they fought I scarce could look at all,"
2879,RAPUNZEL.,"My head swam so; after, a moaning low"
2880,RAPUNZEL.,Drew my eyes down; I saw against the wall
2881,RAPUNZEL.,
2882,RAPUNZEL.,"One knight lean dead, bleeding from head and breast,"
2883,RAPUNZEL.,Yet seem'd it like a line of poppies red
2884,RAPUNZEL.,"In the golden twilight, as he took his rest,"
2885,RAPUNZEL.,In the dusky time he scarcely seemed dead.
2886,RAPUNZEL.,
2887,RAPUNZEL.,"But the other, on his face, six paces off,"
2888,RAPUNZEL.,"Lay moaning, and the old familiar name"
2889,RAPUNZEL.,"He mutter'd through the grass, seem'd like a scoff"
2890,RAPUNZEL.,Of some lost soul remembering his past fame.
2891,RAPUNZEL.,
2892,RAPUNZEL.,"His helm all dinted lay beside him there,"
2893,RAPUNZEL.,"The visor-bars were twisted towards the face,"
2894,RAPUNZEL.,"The crest, which was a lady very fair,"
2895,RAPUNZEL.,"Wrought wonderfully, was shifted from its place."
2896,RAPUNZEL.,
2897,RAPUNZEL.,"The shower'd mail-rings on the speedwell lay,"
2898,RAPUNZEL.,Perhaps my eyes were dazzled with the light
2899,RAPUNZEL.,"That blazed in the west, yet surely on that day"
2900,RAPUNZEL.,Some crimson thing had changed the grass from bright
2901,RAPUNZEL.,
2902,RAPUNZEL.,Pure green I love so. But the knight who died
2903,RAPUNZEL.,Lay there for days after the other went;
2904,RAPUNZEL.,Until one day I heard a voice that cried:
2905,RAPUNZEL.,"Fair knight, I see Sir Robert we were sent"
2906,RAPUNZEL.,
2907,RAPUNZEL.,To carry dead or living to the king.
2908,RAPUNZEL.,So the knights came and bore him straight away
2909,RAPUNZEL.,"On their lance truncheons, such a batter'd thing,"
2910,RAPUNZEL.,"His mother had not known him on that day,"
2911,RAPUNZEL.,
2912,RAPUNZEL.,"But for his helm-crest, a gold lady fair"
2913,RAPUNZEL.,Wrought wonderfully.

2915,THE PRINCE.,THE PRINCE.
2916,THE PRINCE.,

2924,RAPUNZEL.,
2925,RAPUNZEL.,"Yea, love; but shall we not depart from hence?"

2927,RAPUNZEL.,"Between the aspens stems; I fear, and yet a sense"
2928,RAPUNZEL.,
2929,RAPUNZEL.,"Of fluttering victory comes over me,"
2930,RAPUNZEL.,"That will not let me fear aright; my heart,"
2931,RAPUNZEL.,"Feel how it beats, love, strives to get to thee;"
2932,RAPUNZEL.,I breathe so fast that my lips needs must part;

2942,THE PRINCE.,"Now let us go, love, down the winding stair,"
2943,THE PRINCE.,"With fingers intertwined: ay, feel my sword!"
2944,THE PRINCE.,"I wrought it long ago, with golden hair"
2945,THE PRINCE.,"Flowing about the hilts, because a word,"
2946,THE PRINCE.,
2947,THE PRINCE.,"Sung by a minstrel old, had set me dreaming"
2948,THE PRINCE.,Of a sweet bow'd down face with yellow hair;
2949,THE PRINCE.,"Betwixt green leaves I used to see it gleaming,"
2950,THE PRINCE.,"A half smile on the lips, though lines of care"
2951,THE PRINCE.,
2952,THE PRINCE.,"Had sunk the cheeks, and made the great eyes hollow;"
2953,THE PRINCE.,"What other work in all the world had I,"
2954,THE PRINCE.,But through all turns of fate that face to follow?
2955,THE PRINCE.,But wars and business kept me there to die.
2956,THE PRINCE.,
2957,THE PRINCE.,"O child, I should have slain my brother, too,"
2958,THE PRINCE.,"My brother, Love, lain moaning in the grass,"

2960,THE PRINCE.,When I had watch'd the gilded courtiers pass
2961,THE PRINCE.,
2962,THE PRINCE.,From the golden hall. But it is strange your name

2977,THE PRINCE.,THE PRINCE.
2978,THE PRINCE.,
2979,THE PRINCE.,"Dip down your dear face in the dewy grass, O love!"
2980,THE PRINCE.,"And ever let the sweet slim harebells, tenderly hung,"
2981,THE PRINCE.,"Kiss both your parted lips; and I will hang above,"
2982,THE PRINCE.,And try to sing that song the dreamy harper sung.
2983,THE PRINCE.,
2984,THE PRINCE.,_He sings._
2985,THE PRINCE.,
2986,THE PRINCE.,'Twixt the sunlight and the shade

3132,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Dear gold all round his girdle; far and wide
3133,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3134,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,The villaynes dwelt in utter misery
3135,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,'Twixt us and thief Sir Geffray; hauled this way
3136,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"By Sir Bonne Lance at one time; he gone by,"
3137,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Down comes this Teste Noire on another day.
3138,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3139,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And therefore they dig up the stone, grind corn,"
3140,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Hew wood, draw water, yea, they lived, in short,"
3141,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"As I said just now, utterly forlorn,"
3142,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Till this our knave and blackhead was out-fought.
3143,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3144,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"So Bonne Lance fretted, thinking of some trap"
3145,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Day after day, till on a time he said:"
3146,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"John of Newcastle, if we have good hap,"
3147,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,We catch our thief in two days. How? I said.
3148,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3149,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Why, Sir, to-day he rideth out again,"
3150,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Hoping to take well certain sumpter mules
3151,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"From Carcassonne, going with little train,"
3152,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Because, forsooth, he thinketh us mere fools;"
3153,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3154,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"But if we set an ambush in some wood,"
3155,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"He is but dead: so, Sir, take thirty spears"
3156,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"To Verville forest, if it seem you good."
3157,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Then felt I like the horse in Job, who hears"
3158,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3159,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"The dancing trumpet sound, and we went forth;"
3160,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And my red lion on the spear-head flapped,"
3161,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"As faster than the cool wind we rode north,"
3162,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Towards the wood of Verville; thus it happed.
3163,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3164,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"We rode a soft pace on that day, while spies"
3165,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Got news about Sir Geffray: the red wine
3166,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Under the road-side bush was clear; the flies,"
3167,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"The dragon-flies I mind me most, did shine"
3168,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3169,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,In brighter arms than ever I put on;
3170,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"So: Geffray, said our spies, would pass that way"
3171,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Next day at sundown: then he must be won;
3172,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And so we enter'd Verville wood next day,"
3173,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3174,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"In the afternoon; through it the highway runs,"
3175,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"'Twixt copses of green hazel, very thick,"
3176,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And underneath, with glimmering of suns,"
3177,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,The primroses are happy; the dews lick
3178,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3179,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"The soft green moss: 'Put cloths about your arms,"
3180,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Lest they should glitter; surely they will go
3181,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"In a long thin line, watchful for alarms,"
3182,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"With all their carriages of booty; so,"
3183,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3184,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Lay down my pennon in the grass: Lord God.
3185,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"What have we lying here? will they be cold,"
3186,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"I wonder, being so bare, above the sod,"
3187,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Instead of under? This was a knight too, fold"
3188,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3189,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Lying on fold of ancient rusted mail;
3190,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"No plate at all, gold rowels to the spurs,"
3191,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,And see the quiet gleam of turquoise pale
3192,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Along the ceinture; but the long time blurs
3193,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3194,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Even the tinder of his coat to nought,"
3195,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Except these scraps of leather; see how white
3196,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"The skull is, loose within the coif! He fought"
3197,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"A good fight, maybe, ere he was slain quite."
3198,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3199,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,No armour on the legs too; strange in faith!
3200,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"A little skeleton for a knight, though: ah!"
3201,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"This one is bigger, truly without scathe"
3202,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,His enemies escaped not! ribs driven out far;
3203,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3204,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"That must have reach'd the heart, I doubt: how now,"
3205,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"What say you, Aldovrand, a woman? why?'"
3206,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Under the coif a gold wreath on the brow,"
3207,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Yea, see the hair not gone to powder, lie,"
3208,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3209,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Golden, no doubt, once: yea, and very small,"
3210,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"This for a knight; but for a dame, my lord,"
3211,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"These loose-hung bones seem shapely still, and tall."
3212,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Didst ever see a woman's bones, my Lord?"
3213,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3214,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Often, God help me! I remember when"
3215,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"I was a simple boy, fifteen years old,"
3216,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,The Jacquerie froze up the blood of men
3217,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"With their fell deeds, not fit now to be told."
3218,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3219,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"God help again! we enter'd Beauvais town,"
3220,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Slaying them fast, whereto I help'd, mere boy"
3221,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"As I was then; we gentles cut them down,"
3222,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"These burners and defilers, with great joy."
3223,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3224,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Reason for that, too, in the great church there"
3225,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"These fiends had lit a fire, that soon went out,"
3226,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,The church at Beauvais being so great and fair:
3227,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"My father, who was by me, gave a shout"
3228,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3229,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Between a beast's howl and a woman's scream,"
3230,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Then, panting, chuckled to me: 'John, look! look!"
3231,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Count the dames' skeletons!' From some bad dream
3232,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Like a man just awaked, my father shook;"
3233,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3234,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And I, being faint with smelling the burnt bones,"
3235,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And very hot with fighting down the street,"
3236,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And sick of such a life, fell down, with groans"
3237,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,My head went weakly nodding to my feet.
3238,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3239,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"--An arrow had gone through her tender throat,"
3240,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,And her right wrist was broken; then I saw
3241,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"The reason why she had on that war-coat,"
3242,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Their story came out clear without a flaw;
3243,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3244,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"For when he knew that they were being waylaid,"
3245,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"He threw it over her, yea, hood and all;"
3246,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Whereby he was much hack'd, while they were stay'd"
3247,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,By those their murderers; many an one did fall
3248,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3249,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Beneath his arm, no doubt, so that he clear'd"
3250,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Their circle, bore his death-wound out of it;"
3251,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"But as they rode, some archer least afear'd"
3252,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Drew a strong bow, and thereby she was hit."
3253,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3254,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Still as he rode he knew not she was dead,"
3255,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Thought her but fainted from her broken wrist,"
3256,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,He bound with his great leathern belt: she bled?
3257,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Who knows! he bled too, neither was there miss'd"
3258,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3259,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"The beating of her heart, his heart beat well"
3260,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"For both of them, till here, within this wood,"
3261,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,He died scarce sorry; easy this to tell;
3262,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,After these years the flowers forget their blood.
3263,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3264,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"How could it be? never before that day,"
3265,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"However much a soldier I might be,"
3266,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Could I look on a skeleton and say
3267,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"I care not for it, shudder not: now see,"
3268,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3269,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Over those bones I sat and pored for hours,"
3270,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And thought, and dream'd, and still I scarce could see"
3271,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"The small white bones that lay upon the flowers,"
3272,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,But evermore I saw the lady; she
3273,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3274,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"With her dear gentle walking leading in,"
3275,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"By a chain of silver twined about her wrists,"
3276,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Her loving knight, mounted and arm'd to win"
3277,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Great honour for her, fighting in the lists."
3278,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3279,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"O most pale face, that brings such joy and sorrow"
3280,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Into men's hearts (yea, too, so piercing sharp"
3281,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"That joy is, that it marcheth nigh to sorrow"
3282,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"For ever, like an overwinded harp)."
3283,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3284,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Your face must hurt me always: pray you now,"
3285,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Doth it not hurt you too? seemeth some pain
3286,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"To hold you always, pain to hold your brow"
3287,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"So smooth, unwrinkled ever; yea again,"
3288,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3289,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Your long eyes where the lids seem like to drop,"
3290,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Would you not, lady, were they shut fast, feel"
3291,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Far merrier? there so high they will not stop,"
3292,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,They are most sly to glide forth and to steal
3293,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3294,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Into my heart; I kiss their soft lids there,"
3295,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,And in green gardens scarce can stop my lips
3296,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"From wandering on your face, but that your hair"
3297,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Falls down and tangles me, back my face slips."
3298,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3299,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Or say your mouth, I saw you drink red wine"
3300,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Once at a feast; how slowly it sank in,"
3301,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,As though you fear'd that some wild fate might twine
3302,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Within that cup, and slay you for a sin."
3303,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3304,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,And when you talk your lips do arch and move
3305,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,In such wise that a language new I know
3306,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Besides their sound; they quiver, too, with love"
3307,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"When you are standing silent; know this, too,"
3308,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3309,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"I saw you kissing once, like a curved sword"
3310,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"That bites with all its edge, did your lips lie,"
3311,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Curled gently, slowly, long time could afford"
3312,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,For caught-up breathings: like a dying sigh
3313,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3314,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"They gather'd up their lines and went away,"
3315,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And still kept twitching with a sort of smile,"
3316,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,As likely to be weeping presently;
3317,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Your hands too, how I watch'd them all the while!"
3318,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3319,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Cry out St. Peter now, quoth Aldovrand;"
3320,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"I cried, St. Peter! broke out from the wood"
3321,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"With all my spears; we met them hand to hand,"
3322,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And shortly slew them; natheless, by the rood,"
3323,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3324,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"We caught not Blackhead then, or any day;"
3325,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Months after that he died at last in bed,"
3326,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,From a wound pick'd up at a barrier-fray;
3327,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"That same year's end a steel bolt in the head,"
3328,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3329,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,And much bad living killed Teste Noire at last;
3330,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"John Froissart knoweth he is dead by now,"
3331,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"No doubt, but knoweth not this tale just past;"
3332,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Perchance then you can tell him what I show.
3333,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3334,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"In my new castle, down beside the Eure,"
3335,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"There is a little chapel of squared stone,"
3336,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Painted inside and out; in green nook pure
3337,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"There did I lay them, every wearied bone;"
3338,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3339,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"And over it they lay, with stone-white hands"
3340,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"Clasped fast together, hair made bright with gold;"
3341,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,"This Jaques Picard, known through many lands,"
3342,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,Wrought cunningly; he's dead now: I am old.
3343,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3344,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,
3345,CONCERNING GEFFRAY TESTE NOIRE,

3347,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON
3348,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3349,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3350,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"SIR GUY, _being in the court of a Pagan castle_."
3351,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3352,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"This castle where I dwell, it stands"
3353,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"A long way off from Christian lands,"
3354,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"A long way off my lady's hands,"
3355,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"A long way off the aspen trees,"
3356,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,And murmur of the lime-tree bees.
3357,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3358,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,But down the Valley of the Rose
3359,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"My lady often hawking goes,"
3360,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Heavy of cheer; oft turns behind,"
3361,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Leaning towards the western wind,"
3362,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Because it bringeth to her mind
3363,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Sad whisperings of happy times,"
3364,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,The face of him who sings these rhymes.
3365,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3366,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"King Guilbert rides beside her there,"
3367,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Bends low and calls her very fair,"
3368,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"And strives, by pulling down his hair,"
3369,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,To hide from my dear lady's ken
3370,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"The grisly gash I gave him, when"
3371,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,I cut him down at Camelot;
3372,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"However he strives, he hides it not,"
3373,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"That tourney will not be forgot,"
3374,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Besides, it is King Guilbert's lot,"
3375,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Whatever he says she answers not.
3376,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3377,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Now tell me, you that are in love,"
3378,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"From the king's son to the wood-dove,"
3379,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Which is the better, he or I?"
3380,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3381,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,For this king means that I should die
3382,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"In this lone Pagan castle, where"
3383,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,The flowers droop in the bad air
3384,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,On the September evening.
3385,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3386,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Look, now I take mine ease and sing,"
3387,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Counting as but a little thing
3388,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,The foolish spite of a bad king.
3389,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3390,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"For these vile things that hem me in,"
3391,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"These Pagan beasts who live in sin,"
3392,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"The sickly flowers pale and wan,"
3393,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"The grim blue-bearded castellan,"
3394,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"The stanchions half worn-out with rust,"
3395,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Whereto their banner vile they trust:
3396,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Why, all these things I hold them just"
3397,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"As dragons in a missal book,"
3398,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Wherein, whenever we may look,"
3399,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"We see no horror, yea delight"
3400,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"We have, the colours are so bright;"
3401,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Likewise we note the specks of white,"
3402,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,And the great plates of burnish'd gold.
3403,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3404,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Just so this Pagan castle old,"
3405,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"And everything I can see there,"
3406,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Sick-pining in the marshland air,"
3407,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"I note: I will go over now,"
3408,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Like one who paints with knitted brow,"
3409,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"The flowers and all things one by one,"
3410,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,From the snail on the wall to the setting sun.
3411,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3412,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Four great walls, and a little one"
3413,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"That leads down to the barbican,"
3414,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Which walls with many spears they man,"
3415,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,When news comes to the castellan
3416,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Of Launcelot being in the land.
3417,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3418,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"And as I sit here, close at hand"
3419,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Four spikes of sad sick sunflowers stand;
3420,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,The castellan with a long wand
3421,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Cuts down their leaves as he goes by,"
3422,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Ponderingly, with screw'd-up eye,"
3423,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,And fingers twisted in his beard.
3424,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Nay, was it a knight's shout I heard?"
3425,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,I have a hope makes me afeard:
3426,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"It cannot be, but if some dream"
3427,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Just for a minute made me deem
3428,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,I saw among the flowers there
3429,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"My lady's face with long red hair,"
3430,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Pale, ivory-colour'd dear face come,"
3431,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,As I was wont to see her some
3432,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Fading September afternoon,"
3433,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"And kiss me, saying nothing, soon"
3434,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,To leave me by myself again;
3435,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Could I get this by longing? vain!
3436,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3437,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,The castellan is gone: I see
3438,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,On one broad yellow flower a bee
3439,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Drunk with much honey.
3440,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Christ! again,"
3441,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Some distant knight's voice brings me pain,"
3442,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"I thought I had forgot to feel,"
3443,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,I never heard the blissful steel
3444,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"These ten years past; year after year,"
3445,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Through all my hopeless sojourn here,"
3446,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,No Christian pennon has been near.
3447,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Laus Deo! the dragging wind draws on
3448,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Over the marshes, battle won,"
3449,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Knights' shouts, and axes hammering;"
3450,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Yea, quicker now the dint and ring"
3451,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Of flying hoofs; ah, castellan,"
3452,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"When they come back count man for man,"
3453,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Say whom you miss.
3454,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3455,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"THE PAGANS, _from the battlements_."
3456,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3457,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Mahound to aid!
3458,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,Why flee ye so like men dismay'd?
3459,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3460,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"THE PAGANS, _from without_."
3461,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3462,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Nay, haste! for here is Launcelot,"
3463,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,"Who follows quick upon us, hot"
3464,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,And shouting with his men-at-arms.
3465,A GOOD KNIGHT IN PRISON,
3466,SIR GUY.,SIR GUY.
3467,SIR GUY.,
3468,SIR GUY.,"Also the Pagans raise alarms,"
3469,SIR GUY.,And ring the bells for fear; at last
3470,SIR GUY.,My prison walls will be well past.
3471,SIR GUY.,
3472,SIR GUY.,"SIR LAUNCELOT, _from outside_."
3473,SIR GUY.,
3474,SIR GUY.,"Ho! in the name of the Trinity,"
3475,SIR GUY.,"Let down the drawbridge quick to me,"
3476,SIR GUY.,"And open doors, that I may see"
3477,SIR GUY.,Guy the good knight!
3478,SIR GUY.,
3479,SIR GUY.,"THE PAGANS, _from the battlements_."
3480,SIR GUY.,
3481,SIR GUY.,"Nay, Launcelot,"
3482,SIR GUY.,With mere big words ye win us not.
3483,SIR GUY.,
3484,SIR LAUNCELOT.,SIR LAUNCELOT.
3485,SIR LAUNCELOT.,
3486,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"Bid Miles bring up la perriere,"
3487,SIR LAUNCELOT.,And archers clear the vile walls there.
3488,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"Bring back the notches to the ear,"
3489,SIR LAUNCELOT.,Shoot well together! God to aid!
3490,SIR LAUNCELOT.,These miscreants will be well paid.
3491,SIR LAUNCELOT.,
3492,SIR LAUNCELOT.,Hurrah! all goes together; Miles
3493,SIR LAUNCELOT.,Is good to win my lady's smiles
3494,SIR LAUNCELOT.,For his good shooting: Launcelot!
3495,SIR LAUNCELOT.,On knights apace! this game is hot!
3496,SIR LAUNCELOT.,
3497,SIR LAUNCELOT.,SIR GUY _sayeth afterwards_.
3498,SIR LAUNCELOT.,
3499,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"I said, I go to meet her now,"
3500,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"And saying so, I felt a blow"
3501,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"From some clench'd hand across my brow,"
3502,SIR LAUNCELOT.,And fell down on the sunflowers
3503,SIR LAUNCELOT.,Just as a hammering smote my ears;
3504,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"After which this I felt in sooth,"
3505,SIR LAUNCELOT.,My bare hands throttling without ruth
3506,SIR LAUNCELOT.,The hairy-throated castellan;
3507,SIR LAUNCELOT.,Then a grim fight with those that ran
3508,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"To slay me, while I shouted: God"
3509,SIR LAUNCELOT.,For the Lady Mary! deep I trod
3510,SIR LAUNCELOT.,That evening in my own red blood;
3511,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"Nevertheless so stiff I stood,"
3512,SIR LAUNCELOT.,That when the knights burst the old wood
3513,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"Of the castle-doors, I was not dead."
3514,SIR LAUNCELOT.,
3515,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"I kiss the Lady Mary's head,"
3516,SIR LAUNCELOT.,"Her lips, and her hair golden red,"
3517,SIR LAUNCELOT.,Because to-day we have been wed.

3523,OLD LOVE,
3524,OLD LOVE,
3525,OLD LOVE,"You must be very old, Sir Giles,"
3526,OLD LOVE,"I said; he said: Yea, very old!"
3527,OLD LOVE,Whereat the mournfullest of smiles
3528,OLD LOVE,Creased his dry skin with many a fold.
3529,OLD LOVE,
3530,OLD LOVE,They hammer'd out my basnet point
3531,OLD LOVE,"Into a round salade, he said,"
3532,OLD LOVE,"The basnet being quite out of joint,"
3533,OLD LOVE,Natheless the salade rasps my head.
3534,OLD LOVE,
3535,OLD LOVE,He gazed at the great fire awhile:
3536,OLD LOVE,"And you are getting old, Sir John;"
3537,OLD LOVE,(He said this with that cunning smile
3538,OLD LOVE,That was most sad) we both wear on;
3539,OLD LOVE,
3540,OLD LOVE,"Knights come to court and look at me,"
3541,OLD LOVE,"With eyebrows up; except my lord,"
3542,OLD LOVE,"And my dear lady, none I see"
3543,OLD LOVE,That know the ways of my old sword.
3544,OLD LOVE,
3545,OLD LOVE,(My lady! at that word no pang
3546,OLD LOVE,"Stopp'd all my blood). But tell me, John,"
3547,OLD LOVE,Is it quite true that Pagans hang
3548,OLD LOVE,"So thick about the east, that on"
3549,OLD LOVE,
3550,OLD LOVE,The eastern sea no Venice flag
3551,OLD LOVE,"Can fly unpaid for? True, I said,"
3552,OLD LOVE,And in such way the miscreants drag
3553,OLD LOVE,"Christ's cross upon the ground, I dread"
3554,OLD LOVE,
3555,OLD LOVE,That Constantine must fall this year.
3556,OLD LOVE,"Within my heart, these things are small;"
3557,OLD LOVE,"This is not small, that things outwear"
3558,OLD LOVE,"I thought were made for ever, yea, all,"
3559,OLD LOVE,
3560,OLD LOVE,"All things go soon or late, I said."
3561,OLD LOVE,I saw the duke in court next day;
3562,OLD LOVE,"Just as before, his grand great head"
3563,OLD LOVE,"Above his gold robes dreaming lay,"
3564,OLD LOVE,
3565,OLD LOVE,Only his face was paler; there
3566,OLD LOVE,I saw his duchess sit by him;
3567,OLD LOVE,"And she, she was changed more; her hair"
3568,OLD LOVE,"Before my eyes that used to swim,"
3569,OLD LOVE,
3570,OLD LOVE,And make me dizzy with great bliss
3571,OLD LOVE,"Once, when I used to watch her sit,"
3572,OLD LOVE,"Her hair is bright still, yet it is"
3573,OLD LOVE,As though some dust were thrown on it.
3574,OLD LOVE,
3575,OLD LOVE,"Her eyes are shallower, as though"
3576,OLD LOVE,Some grey glass were behind; her brow
3577,OLD LOVE,"And cheeks the straining bones show through,"
3578,OLD LOVE,Are not so good for kissing now.
3579,OLD LOVE,
3580,OLD LOVE,Her lips are drier now she is
3581,OLD LOVE,"A great duke's wife these many years,"
3582,OLD LOVE,They will not shudder with a kiss
3583,OLD LOVE,"As once they did, being moist with tears."
3584,OLD LOVE,
3585,OLD LOVE,Also her hands have lost that way
3586,OLD LOVE,Of clinging that they used to have;
3587,OLD LOVE,"They look'd quite easy, as they lay"
3588,OLD LOVE,Upon the silken cushions brave
3589,OLD LOVE,
3590,OLD LOVE,With broidery of the apples green
3591,OLD LOVE,My Lord Duke bears upon his shield.
3592,OLD LOVE,"Her face, alas! that I have seen"
3593,OLD LOVE,"Look fresher than an April field,"
3594,OLD LOVE,
3595,OLD LOVE,This is all gone now; gone also
3596,OLD LOVE,Her tender walking; when she walks
3597,OLD LOVE,"She is most queenly I well know,"
3598,OLD LOVE,And she is fair still. As the stalks
3599,OLD LOVE,
3600,OLD LOVE,"Of faded summer-lilies are,"
3601,OLD LOVE,So is she grown now unto me
3602,OLD LOVE,"This spring-time, when the flowers star"
3603,OLD LOVE,"The meadows, birds sing wonderfully."
3604,OLD LOVE,
3605,OLD LOVE,I warrant once she used to cling
3606,OLD LOVE,"About his neck, and kiss'd him so,"
3607,OLD LOVE,And then his coming step would ring
3608,OLD LOVE,Joy-bells for her; some time ago.
3609,OLD LOVE,
3610,OLD LOVE,Ah! sometimes like an idle dream
3611,OLD LOVE,"That hinders true life overmuch,"
3612,OLD LOVE,"Sometimes like a lost heaven, these seem."
3613,OLD LOVE,This love is not so hard to smutch.

3621,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,A golden gilliflower to-day
3622,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"I wore upon my helm alway,"
3623,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,And won the prize of this tourney.
3624,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3625,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3626,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"However well Sir Giles might sit,"
3627,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"His sun was weak to wither it,"
3628,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,Lord Miles's blood was dew on it:
3629,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3630,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3631,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Although my spear in splinters flew,"
3632,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"From John's steel-coat, my eye was true;"
3633,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"I wheel'd about, and cried for you,"
3634,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3635,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3636,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Yea, do not doubt my heart was good,"
3637,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Though my sword flew like rotten wood,"
3638,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"To shout, although I scarcely stood,"
3639,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3640,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3641,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"My hand was steady too, to take"
3642,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"My axe from round my neck, and break"
3643,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,John's steel-coat up for my love's sake.
3644,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3645,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3646,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"When I stood in my tent again,"
3647,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Arming afresh, I felt a pain"
3648,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Take hold of me, I was so fain,"
3649,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3650,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3651,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,To hear: _Honneur aux fils des preux!_
3652,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Right in my ears again, and shew"
3653,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,The gilliflower blossom'd new.
3654,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3655,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3656,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"The Sieur Guillaume against me came,"
3657,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,His tabard bore three points of flame
3658,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"From a red heart: with little blame,"
3659,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3660,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3661,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,Our tough spears crackled up like straw;
3662,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,He was the first to turn and draw
3663,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"His sword, that had nor speck nor flaw;"
3664,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3665,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3666,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"But I felt weaker than a maid,"
3667,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"And my brain, dizzied and afraid,"
3668,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Within my helm a fierce tune play'd,"
3669,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3670,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3671,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Until I thought of your dear head,"
3672,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Bow'd to the gilliflower bed,"
3673,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,The yellow flowers stain'd with red;
3674,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3675,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3676,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,Crash! how the swords met: _giroflée!_
3677,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"The fierce tune in my helm would play,"
3678,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_La belle! la belle! jaune giroflée!
3679,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3680,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3681,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,Once more the great swords met again:
3682,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"""_La belle! la belle!_"" but who fell then?"
3683,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Le Sieur Guillaume, who struck down ten;"
3684,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3685,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3686,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"And as with mazed and unarm'd face,"
3687,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Toward my own crown and the Queen's place,"
3688,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,They led me at a gentle pace.
3689,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._
3690,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,
3691,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,I almost saw your quiet head
3692,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,"Bow'd o'er the gilliflower bed,"
3693,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,The yellow flowers stain'd with red.
3694,THE GILLIFLOWER OF GOLD,_Hah! hah! la belle jaune giroflée._

3700,SHAMEFUL DEATH,
3701,SHAMEFUL DEATH,
3702,SHAMEFUL DEATH,There were four of us about that bed;
3703,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"The mass-priest knelt at the side,"
3704,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"I and his mother stood at the head,"
3705,SHAMEFUL DEATH,Over his feet lay the bride;
3706,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"We were quite sure that he was dead,"
3707,SHAMEFUL DEATH,Though his eyes were open wide.
3708,SHAMEFUL DEATH,
3709,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"He did not die in the night,"
3710,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"He did not die in the day,"
3711,SHAMEFUL DEATH,But in the morning twilight
3712,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"His spirit pass'd away,"
3713,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"When neither sun nor moon was bright,"
3714,SHAMEFUL DEATH,And the trees were merely grey.
3715,SHAMEFUL DEATH,
3716,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"He was not slain with the sword,"
3717,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"Knight's axe, or the knightly spear,"
3718,SHAMEFUL DEATH,Yet spoke he never a word
3719,SHAMEFUL DEATH,After he came in here;
3720,SHAMEFUL DEATH,I cut away the cord
3721,SHAMEFUL DEATH,From the neck of my brother dear.
3722,SHAMEFUL DEATH,
3723,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"He did not strike one blow,"
3724,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"For the recreants came behind,"
3725,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"In a place where the hornbeams grow,"
3726,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"A path right hard to find,"
3727,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"For the hornbeam boughs swing so,"
3728,SHAMEFUL DEATH,That the twilight makes it blind.
3729,SHAMEFUL DEATH,
3730,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"They lighted a great torch then,"
3731,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"When his arms were pinion'd fast,"
3732,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"Sir John the knight of the Fen,"
3733,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"Sir Guy of the Dolorous Blast,"
3734,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"With knights threescore and ten,"
3735,SHAMEFUL DEATH,Hung brave Lord Hugh at last.
3736,SHAMEFUL DEATH,
3737,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"I am threescore and ten,"
3738,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"And my hair is all turn'd grey,"
3739,SHAMEFUL DEATH,But I met Sir John of the Fen
3740,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"Long ago on a summer day,"
3741,SHAMEFUL DEATH,And am glad to think of the moment when
3742,SHAMEFUL DEATH,I took his life away.
3743,SHAMEFUL DEATH,
3744,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"I am threescore and ten,"
3745,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"And my strength is mostly pass'd,"
3746,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"But long ago I and my men,"
3747,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"When the sky was overcast,"
3748,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"And the smoke roll'd over the reeds of the fen,"
3749,SHAMEFUL DEATH,Slew Guy of the Dolorous Blast.
3750,SHAMEFUL DEATH,
3751,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"And now, knights all of you,"
3752,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"I pray you pray for Sir Hugh,"
3753,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"A good knight and a true,"
3754,SHAMEFUL DEATH,"And for Alice, his wife, pray too."

3837,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3838,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,The blue owls on my father's hood
3839,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Were a little dimm'd as I turn'd away;

3857,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3858,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,And how Lord Roger bore his face
3859,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"A league above his spear-point, high"
3860,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Above the owls, to that strong place"
3861,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Among the waters; yea, yea, cry:"
3862,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3863,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,What a brave champion we have got!
3864,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Sir Oliver, the flower of all"
3865,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"The Hainault knights! The day being hot,"
3866,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"He sat beneath a broad white pall,"
3867,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3868,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,White linen over all his steel;
3869,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,What a good knight he look'd! his sword
3870,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Laid thwart his knees; he liked to feel
3871,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Its steadfast edge clear as his word.
3872,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3873,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,And he look'd solemn; how his love
3874,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Smiled whitely on him, sick with fear!"
3875,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,How all the ladies up above
3876,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Twisted their pretty hands! so near
3877,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3878,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,The fighting was: Ellayne! Ellayne!
3879,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"They cannot love like you can, who"
3880,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Would burn your hands off, if that pain"
3881,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Could win a kiss; am I not true
3882,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3883,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,To you for ever? therefore I
3884,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Do not fear death or anything;
3885,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"If I should limp home wounded, why,"
3886,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"While I lay sick you would but sing,"
3887,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3888,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,And soothe me into quiet sleep.
3889,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"If they spat on the recreant knight,"
3890,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Threw stones at him, and cursed him deep,"
3891,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Why then: what then? your hand would light
3892,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3893,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"So gently on his drawn-up face,"
3894,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"And you would kiss him, and in soft"
3895,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Cool scented clothes would lap him, pace"
3896,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"The quiet room and weep oft, oft"
3897,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3898,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Would turn and smile, and brush his cheek"
3899,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,With your sweet chin and mouth; and in
3900,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,The order'd garden you would seek
3901,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,The biggest roses: any sin.
3902,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3903,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"And these say: No more now my knight,"
3904,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Or God's knight any longer: you,"
3905,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Being than they so much more white,"
3906,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"So much more pure and good and true,"
3907,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3908,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Will cling to me for ever; there,"
3909,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Is not that wrong turn'd right at last
3910,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Through all these years, and I wash'd clean?"
3911,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Say, yea, Ellayne; the time is past,"
3912,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3913,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Since on that Christmas-day last year
3914,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Up to your feet the fire crept,"
3915,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,And the smoke through the brown leaves sere
3916,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Blinded your dear eyes that you wept;
3917,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3918,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Was it not I that caught you then,"
3919,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,And kiss'd you on the saddle-bow?
3920,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Did not the blue owl mark the men
3921,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Whose spears stood like the corn a-row?
3922,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3923,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"This Oliver is a right good knight,"
3924,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"And must needs beat me, as I fear,"
3925,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Unless I catch him in the fight,"
3926,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"My father's crafty way: John, here!"
3927,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,
3928,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"Bring up the men from the south gate,"
3929,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"To help me if I fall or win,"
3930,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,"For even if I beat, their hate"
3931,THE JUDGMENT OF GOD,Will grow to more than this mere grin.

3940,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Let us ride to the Little Tower again,"
3941,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3942,THE LITTLE TOWER,Up and away from the council board!
3943,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Do on the hauberk, gird on the sword."
3944,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3945,THE LITTLE TOWER,"The king is blind with gnashing his teeth,"
3946,THE LITTLE TOWER,Change gilded scabbard to leather sheath:
3947,THE LITTLE TOWER,

3949,THE LITTLE TOWER,This is joy to ride to my love again:
3950,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3951,THE LITTLE TOWER,I laugh in his face when he bids me yield;
3952,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Who knows one field from the other field,"
3953,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3954,THE LITTLE TOWER,For the grey rain driveth all astray?
3955,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Which way through the floods, good carle, I pray"
3956,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3957,THE LITTLE TOWER,The left side yet! the left side yet!
3958,THE LITTLE TOWER,Till your hand strikes on the bridge parapet.
3959,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3960,THE LITTLE TOWER,Yea so: the causeway holdeth good
3961,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Under the water? Hard as wood,"
3962,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3963,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Right away to the uplands; speed, good knight!"
3964,THE LITTLE TOWER,Seven hours yet before the light.
3965,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3966,THE LITTLE TOWER,Shake the wet off on the upland road;
3967,THE LITTLE TOWER,My tabard has grown a heavy load.
3968,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3969,THE LITTLE TOWER,What matter? up and down hill after hill;
3970,THE LITTLE TOWER,Dead grey night for five hours still.
3971,THE LITTLE TOWER,

3974,THE LITTLE TOWER,

3976,THE LITTLE TOWER,The Little Tower draweth in sight;
3977,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3978,THE LITTLE TOWER,"They are ringing the bells, and the torches glare,"
3979,THE LITTLE TOWER,Therefore the roofs of wet slate stare.
3980,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3981,THE LITTLE TOWER,"There she stands, and her yellow hair slantingly"
3982,THE LITTLE TOWER,Drifts the same way that the rain goes by.
3983,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3984,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Who will be faithful to us to-day,"
3985,THE LITTLE TOWER,With little but hard glaive-strokes for pay?

3991,THE LITTLE TOWER,"And above his white brows, pale and dead,"
3992,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3993,THE LITTLE TOWER,A paper crown on the top of the spire;
3994,THE LITTLE TOWER,And for her the stake and the witches' fire.
3995,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3996,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Therefore though it be long ere day,"
3997,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Take axe and pick and spade, I pray."
3998,THE LITTLE TOWER,
3999,THE LITTLE TOWER,Break the dams down all over the plain:
4000,THE LITTLE TOWER,God send us three more days such rain!
4001,THE LITTLE TOWER,
4002,THE LITTLE TOWER,Block all the upland roads with trees;
4003,THE LITTLE TOWER,The Little Tower with no great ease
4004,THE LITTLE TOWER,
4005,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Is won, I warrant; bid them bring"
4006,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Much sheep and oxen, everything"
4007,THE LITTLE TOWER,

4010,THE LITTLE TOWER,
4011,THE LITTLE TOWER,In plenty each day of the siege.
4012,THE LITTLE TOWER,"Good friends, ye know me no hard liege;"

4015,THE LITTLE TOWER,Pray God to keep you frank and free.

4033,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"_When the Sword went out to sea,_"
4034,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,I scarcely saw my sisters' heads
4035,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,Bowed each beside a tree.
4036,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"I could not see the castle leads,"
4037,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"_When the Sword went out to sea,_"
4038,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,
4039,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"Alicia wore a scarlet gown,"
4040,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"_When the Sword went out to sea,_"
4041,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,But Ursula's was russet brown:
4042,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,For the mist we could not see
4043,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"The scarlet roofs of the good town,"
4044,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,_When the Sword went out to sea._
4045,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,
4046,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"Green holly in Alicia's hand,"
4047,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,_When the Sword went out to sea;_
4048,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,With sere oak-leaves did Ursula stand;

4050,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"I did but bear a peel'd white wand,"
4051,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,_When the Sword went out to sea._
4052,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,

4054,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"_When the Sword went out to sea,_"
4055,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,My sisters wore; I wore but white:
4056,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"Red, brown, and white, are three;"
4057,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"Three damozels; each had a knight,"
4058,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,_When the Sword went out to sea._
4059,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,
4060,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"Sir Robert shouted loud, and said:"

4062,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"Alicia, while I see thy head,"
4063,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,What shall I bring for thee?

4075,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"_When the Sword went out to sea,_"
4076,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,But only turn'd away his head;
4077,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,A quick shriek came from me:
4078,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"Come back, dear lord, to your white maid."
4079,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,_The Sword went out to sea._
4080,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,

4084,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,Stretched out toward the sea;

4088,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"Lord Robert brought a ruby red,"

4098,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"What joy, O love, but thee?"
4099,THE SAILING OF THE SWORD,"Let us be wed in the good town,"

4116,SPELL-BOUND,How dismally the days go by!
4117,SPELL-BOUND,"I hear the tinkling of the bell,"
4118,SPELL-BOUND,I see the cross against the sky.
4119,SPELL-BOUND,
4120,SPELL-BOUND,"The year wears round to Autumn-tide,"
4121,SPELL-BOUND,Yet comes no reaper to the corn;
4122,SPELL-BOUND,The golden land is like a bride
4123,SPELL-BOUND,When first she knows herself forlorn;
4124,SPELL-BOUND,
4125,SPELL-BOUND,She sits and weeps with all her hair
4126,SPELL-BOUND,Laid downward over tender hands;
4127,SPELL-BOUND,"For stainèd silk she hath no care,"
4128,SPELL-BOUND,No care for broken ivory wands;
4129,SPELL-BOUND,
4130,SPELL-BOUND,The silver cups beside her stand;
4131,SPELL-BOUND,The golden stars on the blue roof
4132,SPELL-BOUND,"Yet glitter, though against her hand"
4133,SPELL-BOUND,His cold sword presses for a proof
4134,SPELL-BOUND,
4135,SPELL-BOUND,"He is not dead, but gone away."
4136,SPELL-BOUND,How many hours did she wait
4137,SPELL-BOUND,"For me, I wonder? Till the day"
4138,SPELL-BOUND,"Had faded wholly, and the gate"
4139,SPELL-BOUND,
4140,SPELL-BOUND,Clanged to behind returning knights?
4141,SPELL-BOUND,I wonder did she raise her head
4142,SPELL-BOUND,"And go away, fleeing the lights;"
4143,SPELL-BOUND,"And lay the samite on her bed,"
4144,SPELL-BOUND,
4145,SPELL-BOUND,The wedding samite strewn with pearls:
4146,SPELL-BOUND,"Then sit with hands laid on her knees,"
4147,SPELL-BOUND,Shuddering at half-heard sound of girls
4148,SPELL-BOUND,That chatter outside in the breeze?
4149,SPELL-BOUND,
4150,SPELL-BOUND,I wonder did her poor heart throb
4151,SPELL-BOUND,At distant tramp of coming knight?
4152,SPELL-BOUND,How often did the choking sob
4153,SPELL-BOUND,"Raise up her head and lips? The light,"
4154,SPELL-BOUND,
4155,SPELL-BOUND,"Did it come on her unawares,"
4156,SPELL-BOUND,And drag her sternly down before
4157,SPELL-BOUND,People who loved her not? in prayers
4158,SPELL-BOUND,Did she say one name and no more?
4159,SPELL-BOUND,
4160,SPELL-BOUND,"And once, all songs they ever sung,"
4161,SPELL-BOUND,"All tales they ever told to me,"
4162,SPELL-BOUND,This only burden through them rung:
4163,SPELL-BOUND,_O golden love that waitest me!_
4164,SPELL-BOUND,
4165,SPELL-BOUND,"_The days pass on, pass on apace,"
4166,SPELL-BOUND,Sometimes I have a little rest
4167,SPELL-BOUND,"In fairest dreams, when on thy face"
4168,SPELL-BOUND,"My lips lie, or thy hands are prest_"
4169,SPELL-BOUND,
4170,SPELL-BOUND,"_About my forehead, and thy lips"
4171,SPELL-BOUND,Draw near and nearer to mine own;
4172,SPELL-BOUND,"But when the vision from me slips,"
4173,SPELL-BOUND,"In colourless dawn I lie and moan,_"
4174,SPELL-BOUND,
4175,SPELL-BOUND,"_And wander forth with fever'd blood,"
4176,SPELL-BOUND,"That makes me start at little things,"
4177,SPELL-BOUND,"The blackbird screaming from the wood,"
4178,SPELL-BOUND,The sudden whirr of pheasants' wings._
4179,SPELL-BOUND,
4180,SPELL-BOUND,"_O dearest, scarcely seen by me!_"
4181,SPELL-BOUND,"But when that wild time had gone by,"
4182,SPELL-BOUND,"And in these arms I folded thee,"
4183,SPELL-BOUND,Who ever thought those days could die?
4184,SPELL-BOUND,
4185,SPELL-BOUND,"Yet now I wait, and you wait too,"
4186,SPELL-BOUND,For what perchance may never come;
4187,SPELL-BOUND,"You think I have forgotten you,"
4188,SPELL-BOUND,That I grew tired and went home.
4189,SPELL-BOUND,
4190,SPELL-BOUND,But what if some day as I stood
4191,SPELL-BOUND,"Against the wall with strainèd hands,"
4192,SPELL-BOUND,"And turn'd my face toward the wood,"
4193,SPELL-BOUND,Away from all the golden lands;
4194,SPELL-BOUND,
4195,SPELL-BOUND,"And saw you come with tired feet,"
4196,SPELL-BOUND,"And pale face thin and wan with care,"
4197,SPELL-BOUND,"And stainèd raiment no more neat,"
4198,SPELL-BOUND,The white dust lying on your hair:
4199,SPELL-BOUND,
4200,SPELL-BOUND,"Then I should say, I could not come;"
4201,SPELL-BOUND,"This land was my wide prison, dear;"
4202,SPELL-BOUND,I could not choose but go; at home
4203,SPELL-BOUND,There is a wizard whom I fear:
4204,SPELL-BOUND,
4205,SPELL-BOUND,He bound me round with silken chains
4206,SPELL-BOUND,I could not break; he set me here
4207,SPELL-BOUND,"Above the golden-waving plains,"
4208,SPELL-BOUND,Where never reaper cometh near.
4209,SPELL-BOUND,
4210,SPELL-BOUND,"And you have brought me my good sword,"
4211,SPELL-BOUND,Wherewith in happy days of old
4212,SPELL-BOUND,I won you well from knight and lord;
4213,SPELL-BOUND,My heart upswells and I grow bold.
4214,SPELL-BOUND,
4215,SPELL-BOUND,"But I shall die unless you stand,"
4216,SPELL-BOUND,"Half lying now, you are so weak,"
4217,SPELL-BOUND,"Within my arms, unless your hand"
4218,SPELL-BOUND,Pass to and fro across my cheek.

4237,THE WIND,

4256,THE WIND,"Whether I like it or not, a grim half-slumber is cast"
4257,THE WIND,
4258,THE WIND,"Over my worn old brains, that touches the roots of my heart,"
4259,THE WIND,"And above my half-shut eyes, the blue roof 'gins to part,"
4260,THE WIND,"And show the blue spring sky, till I am ready to start"
4261,THE WIND,
4262,THE WIND,"From out of the green-hung chair; but something keeps me still,"
4263,THE WIND,"And I fall in a dream that I walk'd with her on the side of a hill,"
4264,THE WIND,"Dotted, for was it not spring? with tufts of the daffodil."

4269,THE WIND,
4270,THE WIND,And Margaret as she walk'd held a painted book in her hand;
4271,THE WIND,"Her finger kept the place; I caught her, we both did stand"
4272,THE WIND,"Face to face, on the top of the highest hill in the land."
4273,THE WIND,
4274,THE WIND,"_Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?"
4275,THE WIND,"Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,"
4276,THE WIND,Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find._
4277,THE WIND,
4278,THE WIND,"I held to her long bare arms, but she shudder'd away from me,"
4279,THE WIND,"While the flush went out of her face as her head fell back on a tree,"
4280,THE WIND,"And a spasm caught her mouth, fearful for me to see;"
4281,THE WIND,
4282,THE WIND,"And still I held to her arms till her shoulder touched my mail,"
4283,THE WIND,"Weeping she totter'd forward, so glad that I should prevail,"
4284,THE WIND,"And her hair went over my robe, like a gold flag over a sail."
4285,THE WIND,
4286,THE WIND,"_Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?"
4287,THE WIND,"Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,"
4288,THE WIND,Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find._
4289,THE WIND,
4290,THE WIND,"I kiss'd her hard by the ear, and she kiss'd me on the brow,"
4291,THE WIND,"And then lay down on the grass, where the mark on the moss is now,"
4292,THE WIND,And spread her arms out wide while I went down below.
4293,THE WIND,
4294,THE WIND,"_Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?"
4295,THE WIND,"Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,"
4296,THE WIND,Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find._
4297,THE WIND,
4298,THE WIND,"And then I walk'd for a space to and fro on the side of the hill,"
4299,THE WIND,"Till I gather'd and held in my arms great sheaves of the daffodil,"
4300,THE WIND,And when I came again my Margaret lay there still.
4301,THE WIND,
4302,THE WIND,"I piled them high and high above her heaving breast,"
4303,THE WIND,How they were caught and held in her loose ungirded vest!
4304,THE WIND,"But one beneath her arm died, happy so to be prest!"
4305,THE WIND,
4306,THE WIND,"_Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?"
4307,THE WIND,"Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,"
4308,THE WIND,Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find._
4309,THE WIND,
4310,THE WIND,Again I turn'd my back and went away for an hour;
4311,THE WIND,"She said no word when I came again, so, flower by flower,"
4312,THE WIND,"I counted the daffodils over, and cast them languidly lower."
4313,THE WIND,
4314,THE WIND,"_Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?"
4315,THE WIND,"Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,"
4316,THE WIND,Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find._
4317,THE WIND,
4318,THE WIND,"My dry hands shook and shook as the green gown show'd again,"
4319,THE WIND,"Clear'd from the yellow flowers, and I grew hollow with pain,"
4320,THE WIND,And on to us both there fell from the sun-shower drops of rain.
4321,THE WIND,
4322,THE WIND,"_Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?"
4323,THE WIND,"Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,"
4324,THE WIND,Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find._
4325,THE WIND,
4326,THE WIND,"Alas! alas! there was blood on the very quiet breast,"
4327,THE WIND,"Blood lay in the many folds of the loose ungirded vest,"
4328,THE WIND,Blood lay upon her arm where the flower had been prest.
4329,THE WIND,
4330,THE WIND,"I shriek'd and leapt from my chair, and the orange roll'd out afar,"
4331,THE WIND,The faint yellow juice oozed out like blood from a wizard's jar;
4332,THE WIND,And then in march'd the ghosts of those that had gone to the war.
4333,THE WIND,
4334,THE WIND,I knew them by the arms that I was used to paint
4335,THE WIND,"Upon their long thin shields; but the colours were all grown faint,"
4336,THE WIND,"And faint upon their banner was Olaf, king and saint."
4337,THE WIND,
4338,THE WIND,"_Wind, wind! thou art sad, art thou kind?"
4339,THE WIND,"Wind, wind, unhappy! thou art blind,"
4340,THE WIND,Yet still thou wanderest the lily-seed to find._

4518,GOLDEN WINGS,"Midways of a wallèd garden,"
4519,GOLDEN WINGS,"In the happy poplar land,"
4520,GOLDEN WINGS,"Did an ancient castle stand,"
4521,GOLDEN WINGS,With an old knight for a warden.
4522,GOLDEN WINGS,
4523,GOLDEN WINGS,Many scarlet bricks there were
4524,GOLDEN WINGS,"In its walls, and old grey stone;"
4525,GOLDEN WINGS,Over which red apples shone
4526,GOLDEN WINGS,At the right time of the year.
4527,GOLDEN WINGS,
4528,GOLDEN WINGS,On the bricks the green moss grew.
4529,GOLDEN WINGS,"Yellow lichen on the stone,"
4530,GOLDEN WINGS,Over which red apples shone;
4531,GOLDEN WINGS,Little war that castle knew.
4532,GOLDEN WINGS,
4533,GOLDEN WINGS,"Deep green water fill'd the moat,"
4534,GOLDEN WINGS,"Each side had a red-brick lip,"
4535,GOLDEN WINGS,Green and mossy with the drip
4536,GOLDEN WINGS,Of dew and rain; there was a boat
4537,GOLDEN WINGS,
4538,GOLDEN WINGS,"Of carven wood, with hangings green"
4539,GOLDEN WINGS,About the stern; it was great bliss
4540,GOLDEN WINGS,For lovers to sit there and kiss
4541,GOLDEN WINGS,"In the hot summer noons, not seen."
4542,GOLDEN WINGS,
4543,GOLDEN WINGS,Across the moat the fresh west wind
4544,GOLDEN WINGS,In very little ripples went;
4545,GOLDEN WINGS,The way the heavy aspens bent
4546,GOLDEN WINGS,"Towards it, was a thing to mind."
4547,GOLDEN WINGS,
4548,GOLDEN WINGS,The painted drawbridge over it
4549,GOLDEN WINGS,"Went up and down with gilded chains,"
4550,GOLDEN WINGS,'Twas pleasant in the summer rains
4551,GOLDEN WINGS,Within the bridge-house there to sit.
4552,GOLDEN WINGS,
4553,GOLDEN WINGS,There were five swans that ne'er did eat
4554,GOLDEN WINGS,"The water-weeds, for ladies came"
4555,GOLDEN WINGS,"Each day, and young knights did the same,"
4556,GOLDEN WINGS,And gave them cakes and bread for meat.
4557,GOLDEN WINGS,
4558,GOLDEN WINGS,"They had a house of painted wood,"
4559,GOLDEN WINGS,"A red roof gold-spiked over it,"
4560,GOLDEN WINGS,Wherein upon their eggs to sit
4561,GOLDEN WINGS,"Week after week; no drop of blood,"
4562,GOLDEN WINGS,
4563,GOLDEN WINGS,"Drawn from men's bodies by sword-blows,"
4564,GOLDEN WINGS,"Came ever there, or any tear;"

4567,GOLDEN WINGS,
4568,GOLDEN WINGS,"The banners seem'd quite full of ease,"
4569,GOLDEN WINGS,That over the turret-roofs hung down;

4571,GOLDEN WINGS,From the flower-moulded cornices.
4572,GOLDEN WINGS,
4573,GOLDEN WINGS,Who walked in that garden there?

4579,GOLDEN WINGS,"Fair Ellayne le Violet,"
4580,GOLDEN WINGS,"Mary, Constance fille de fay,"
4581,GOLDEN WINGS,Many dames with footfall light.

4584,GOLDEN WINGS,"Whether it be dame or knight,"
4585,GOLDEN WINGS,"Half of scarlet, half of white"
4586,GOLDEN WINGS,Their raiment was; of roses fair
4587,GOLDEN WINGS,
4588,GOLDEN WINGS,"Each wore a garland on the head,"
4589,GOLDEN WINGS,At Ladies' Gard the way was so:
4590,GOLDEN WINGS,Fair Jehane du Castel beau
4591,GOLDEN WINGS,Wore her wreath till it was dead.
4592,GOLDEN WINGS,
4593,GOLDEN WINGS,"Little joy she had of it,"
4594,GOLDEN WINGS,"Of the raiment white and red,"
4595,GOLDEN WINGS,"Or the garland on her head,"
4596,GOLDEN WINGS,She had none with whom to sit
4597,GOLDEN WINGS,
4598,GOLDEN WINGS,In the carven boat at noon;
4599,GOLDEN WINGS,"None the more did Jehane weep,"
4600,GOLDEN WINGS,She would only stand and keep
4601,GOLDEN WINGS,Saying: He will be here soon!
4602,GOLDEN WINGS,
4603,GOLDEN WINGS,Many times in the long day
4604,GOLDEN WINGS,"Miles and Giles and Gervaise passed,"
4605,GOLDEN WINGS,"Holding each some white hand fast,"
4606,GOLDEN WINGS,Every time they heard her say:
4607,GOLDEN WINGS,
4608,GOLDEN WINGS,"Summer cometh to an end,"
4609,GOLDEN WINGS,Undern cometh after noon;
4610,GOLDEN WINGS,"Golden wings will be here soon,"
4611,GOLDEN WINGS,What if I some token send?
4612,GOLDEN WINGS,
4613,GOLDEN WINGS,"Wherefore that night within the hall,"
4614,GOLDEN WINGS,"With open mouth and open eyes,"
4615,GOLDEN WINGS,"Like some one listening with surprise,"
4616,GOLDEN WINGS,She sat before the sight of all.
4617,GOLDEN WINGS,
4618,GOLDEN WINGS,"Stoop'd down a little she sat there,"
4619,GOLDEN WINGS,"With neck stretch'd out and chin thrown up,"
4620,GOLDEN WINGS,One hand around a golden cup;
4621,GOLDEN WINGS,And strangely with her fingers fair
4622,GOLDEN WINGS,
4623,GOLDEN WINGS,She beat some tune upon the gold;
4624,GOLDEN WINGS,The minstrels in the gallery
4625,GOLDEN WINGS,"Sung: Arthur, who will never die,"
4626,GOLDEN WINGS,In Avallon he groweth old.
4627,GOLDEN WINGS,
4628,GOLDEN WINGS,"And when the song was ended, she"
4629,GOLDEN WINGS,Rose and caught up her gown and ran;
4630,GOLDEN WINGS,None stopp'd her eager face and wan
4631,GOLDEN WINGS,Of all that pleasant company.
4632,GOLDEN WINGS,
4633,GOLDEN WINGS,Right so within her own chamber
4634,GOLDEN WINGS,Upon her bed she sat; and drew
4635,GOLDEN WINGS,Her breath in quick gasps; till she knew
4636,GOLDEN WINGS,That no man follow'd after her.
4637,GOLDEN WINGS,
4638,GOLDEN WINGS,"She took the garland from her head,"
4639,GOLDEN WINGS,"Loosed all her hair, and let it lie"
4640,GOLDEN WINGS,Upon the coverlet; thereby
4641,GOLDEN WINGS,She laid the gown of white and red;
4642,GOLDEN WINGS,
4643,GOLDEN WINGS,"And she took off her scarlet shoon,"
4644,GOLDEN WINGS,And bared her feet; still more and more
4645,GOLDEN WINGS,Her sweet face redden'd; evermore
4646,GOLDEN WINGS,She murmur'd: He will be here soon;
4647,GOLDEN WINGS,
4648,GOLDEN WINGS,Truly he cannot fail to know
4649,GOLDEN WINGS,My tender body waits him here;
4650,GOLDEN WINGS,"And if he knows, I have no fear"
4651,GOLDEN WINGS,For poor Jehane du Castel beau.
4652,GOLDEN WINGS,
4653,GOLDEN WINGS,"She took a sword within her hand,"
4654,GOLDEN WINGS,"Whose hilts were silver, and she sung"
4655,GOLDEN WINGS,"Somehow like this, wild words that rung"
4656,GOLDEN WINGS,A long way over the moonlit land:
4657,GOLDEN WINGS,
4658,GOLDEN WINGS,Gold wings across the sea!
4659,GOLDEN WINGS,"Grey light from tree to tree,"
4660,GOLDEN WINGS,"Gold hair beside my knee,"
4661,GOLDEN WINGS,"I pray thee come to me,"
4662,GOLDEN WINGS,Gold wings!
4663,GOLDEN WINGS,
4664,GOLDEN WINGS,"The water slips,"
4665,GOLDEN WINGS,The red-bill'd moorhen dips.
4666,GOLDEN WINGS,Sweet kisses on red lips;
4667,GOLDEN WINGS,"Alas! the red rust grips,"
4668,GOLDEN WINGS,"And the blood-red dagger rips,"
4669,GOLDEN WINGS,"Yet, O knight, come to me!"
4670,GOLDEN WINGS,
4671,GOLDEN WINGS,Are not my blue eyes sweet?
4672,GOLDEN WINGS,The west wind from the wheat
4673,GOLDEN WINGS,Blows cold across my feet;
4674,GOLDEN WINGS,Is it not time to meet
4675,GOLDEN WINGS,Gold wings across the sea?
4676,GOLDEN WINGS,
4677,GOLDEN WINGS,"White swans on the green moat,"
4678,GOLDEN WINGS,Small feathers left afloat
4679,GOLDEN WINGS,By the blue-painted boat;
4680,GOLDEN WINGS,"Swift running of the stoat,"
4681,GOLDEN WINGS,Sweet gurgling note by note
4682,GOLDEN WINGS,Of sweet music.
4683,GOLDEN WINGS,
4684,GOLDEN WINGS,"O gold wings,"
4685,GOLDEN WINGS,"Listen how gold hair sings,"
4686,GOLDEN WINGS,"And the Ladies Castle rings,"
4687,GOLDEN WINGS,Gold wings across the sea.
4688,GOLDEN WINGS,
4689,GOLDEN WINGS,"I sit on a purple bed,"
4690,GOLDEN WINGS,"Outside, the wall is red,"
4691,GOLDEN WINGS,"Thereby the apple hangs,"
4692,GOLDEN WINGS,"And the wasp, caught by the fangs,"
4693,GOLDEN WINGS,
4694,GOLDEN WINGS,"Dies in the autumn night,"
4695,GOLDEN WINGS,"And the bat flits till light,"
4696,GOLDEN WINGS,And the love-crazèd knight
4697,GOLDEN WINGS,
4698,GOLDEN WINGS,Kisses the long wet grass:
4699,GOLDEN WINGS,"The weary days pass,"
4700,GOLDEN WINGS,Gold wings across the sea.
4701,GOLDEN WINGS,
4702,GOLDEN WINGS,Gold wings across the sea!
4703,GOLDEN WINGS,"Moonlight from tree to tree,"
4704,GOLDEN WINGS,"Sweet hair laid on my knee,"
4705,GOLDEN WINGS,"O, sweet knight, come to me."
4706,GOLDEN WINGS,
4707,GOLDEN WINGS,"Gold wings, the short night slips,"
4708,GOLDEN WINGS,"The white swan's long neck drips,"
4709,GOLDEN WINGS,"I pray thee kiss my lips,"
4710,GOLDEN WINGS,Gold wings across the sea!
4711,GOLDEN WINGS,
4712,GOLDEN WINGS,No answer through the moonlit night;
4713,GOLDEN WINGS,No answer in the cold grey dawn;
4714,GOLDEN WINGS,No answer when the shaven lawn
4715,GOLDEN WINGS,"Grew green, and all the roses bright."
4716,GOLDEN WINGS,
4717,GOLDEN WINGS,"Her tired feet look'd cold and thin,"
4718,GOLDEN WINGS,"Her lips were twitch'd, and wretched tears,"
4719,GOLDEN WINGS,"Some, as she lay, roll'd past her ears,"
4720,GOLDEN WINGS,Some fell from off her quivering chin.
4721,GOLDEN WINGS,
4722,GOLDEN WINGS,"Her long throat, stretched to its full length,"
4723,GOLDEN WINGS,Rose up and fell right brokenly;
4724,GOLDEN WINGS,As though the unhappy heart was nigh
4725,GOLDEN WINGS,Striving to break with all its strength.
4726,GOLDEN WINGS,
4727,GOLDEN WINGS,"And when she slipp'd from off the bed,"
4728,GOLDEN WINGS,Her cramp'd feet would not hold her; she
4729,GOLDEN WINGS,"Sank down and crept on hand and knee,"
4730,GOLDEN WINGS,On the window-sill she laid her head.
4731,GOLDEN WINGS,
4732,GOLDEN WINGS,"There, with crooked arm upon the sill,"
4733,GOLDEN WINGS,"She look'd out, muttering dismally:"
4734,GOLDEN WINGS,"There is no sail upon the sea,"
4735,GOLDEN WINGS,No pennon on the empty hill.
4736,GOLDEN WINGS,
4737,GOLDEN WINGS,"I cannot stay here all alone,"
4738,GOLDEN WINGS,"Or meet their happy faces here,"
4739,GOLDEN WINGS,And wretchedly I have no fear;
4740,GOLDEN WINGS,"A little while, and I am gone."
4741,GOLDEN WINGS,
4742,GOLDEN WINGS,"Therewith she rose upon her feet,"
4743,GOLDEN WINGS,And totter'd; cold and misery
4744,GOLDEN WINGS,"Still made the deep sobs come, till she"
4745,GOLDEN WINGS,"At last stretch'd out her fingers sweet,"
4746,GOLDEN WINGS,
4747,GOLDEN WINGS,And caught the great sword in her hand;
4748,GOLDEN WINGS,"And, stealing down the silent stair,"
4749,GOLDEN WINGS,Barefooted in the morning air.
4750,GOLDEN WINGS,"And only in her smock, did stand"
4751,GOLDEN WINGS,
4752,GOLDEN WINGS,Upright upon the green lawn grass;
4753,GOLDEN WINGS,And hope grew in her as she said:
4754,GOLDEN WINGS,"I have thrown off the white and red,"
4755,GOLDEN WINGS,And pray God it may come to pass
4756,GOLDEN WINGS,
4757,GOLDEN WINGS,I meet him; if ten years go by
4758,GOLDEN WINGS,"Before I meet him; if, indeed,"
4759,GOLDEN WINGS,"Meanwhile both soul and body bleed,"
4760,GOLDEN WINGS,"Yet there is end of misery,"
4761,GOLDEN WINGS,
4762,GOLDEN WINGS,"And I have hope. He could not come,"
4763,GOLDEN WINGS,But I can go to him and show
4764,GOLDEN WINGS,"These new things I have got to know,"
4765,GOLDEN WINGS,"And make him speak, who has been dumb."
4766,GOLDEN WINGS,
4767,GOLDEN WINGS,O Jehane! the red morning sun
4768,GOLDEN WINGS,"Changed her white feet to glowing gold,"
4769,GOLDEN WINGS,"Upon her smock, on crease and fold,"
4770,GOLDEN WINGS,Changed that to gold which had been dun.
4771,GOLDEN WINGS,
4772,GOLDEN WINGS,"O Miles, and Giles, and Isabeau,"
4773,GOLDEN WINGS,"Fair Ellayne le Violet,"
4774,GOLDEN WINGS,"Mary, Constance fille de fay!"
4775,GOLDEN WINGS,Where is Jehane du Castel beau?
4776,GOLDEN WINGS,
4777,GOLDEN WINGS,O big Gervaise ride apace!
4778,GOLDEN WINGS,"Down to the hard yellow sand,"
4779,GOLDEN WINGS,Where the water meets the land.
4780,GOLDEN WINGS,This is Jehane by her face.
4781,GOLDEN WINGS,
4782,GOLDEN WINGS,Why has she a broken sword?
4783,GOLDEN WINGS,Mary! she is slain outright;
4784,GOLDEN WINGS,Verily a piteous sight;
4785,GOLDEN WINGS,Take her up without a word!
4786,GOLDEN WINGS,
4787,GOLDEN WINGS,"Giles and Miles and Gervaise there,"
4788,GOLDEN WINGS,Ladies' Gard must meet the war;
4789,GOLDEN WINGS,"Whatsoever knights these are,"
4790,GOLDEN WINGS,Man the walls withouten fear!
4791,GOLDEN WINGS,
4792,GOLDEN WINGS,"Axes to the apple-trees,"
4793,GOLDEN WINGS,Axes to the aspens tall!
4794,GOLDEN WINGS,Barriers without the wall
4795,GOLDEN WINGS,May be lightly made of these.
4796,GOLDEN WINGS,
4797,GOLDEN WINGS,O poor shivering Isabeau;
4798,GOLDEN WINGS,"Poor Ellayne le Violet,"
4799,GOLDEN WINGS,Bent with fear! we miss to-day
4800,GOLDEN WINGS,Brave Jehane du Castel beau.
4801,GOLDEN WINGS,
4802,GOLDEN WINGS,"O poor Mary, weeping so!"
4803,GOLDEN WINGS,Wretched Constance fille de fay!
4804,GOLDEN WINGS,Verily we miss to-day
4805,GOLDEN WINGS,Fair Jehane du Castel beau.
4806,GOLDEN WINGS,
4807,GOLDEN WINGS,The apples now grow green and sour
4808,GOLDEN WINGS,"Upon the mouldering castle-wall,"
4809,GOLDEN WINGS,Before they ripen there they fall:
4810,GOLDEN WINGS,"There are no banners on the tower,"
4811,GOLDEN WINGS,
4812,GOLDEN WINGS,The draggled swans most eagerly eat
4813,GOLDEN WINGS,The green weeds trailing in the moat;
4814,GOLDEN WINGS,Inside the rotting leaky boat
4815,GOLDEN WINGS,You see a slain man's stiffen'd feet.
4816,GOLDEN WINGS,
4817,GOLDEN WINGS,
4818,GOLDEN WINGS,
4819,GOLDEN WINGS,
4820,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS
4821,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4822,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4823,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Had she come all the way for this,"
4824,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,To part at last without a kiss?
4825,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Yea, had she borne the dirt and rain"
4826,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,That her own eyes might see him slain
4827,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Beside the haystack in the floods?
4828,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4829,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Along the dripping leafless woods,"
4830,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"The stirrup touching either shoe,"
4831,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,She rode astride as troopers do;
4832,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"With kirtle kilted to her knee,"
4833,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,To which the mud splash'd wretchedly;
4834,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And the wet dripp'd from every tree
4835,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Upon her head and heavy hair,"
4836,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And on her eyelids broad and fair;
4837,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,The tears and rain ran down her face.
4838,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"By fits and starts they rode apace,"
4839,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And very often was his place
4840,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Far off from her; he had to ride
4841,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Ahead, to see what might betide"
4842,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"When the roads cross'd; and sometimes, when"
4843,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"There rose a murmuring from his men,"
4844,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Had to turn back with promises.
4845,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Ah me! she had but little ease;
4846,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And often for pure doubt and dread
4847,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"She sobb'd, made giddy in the head"
4848,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"By the swift riding; while, for cold,"
4849,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Her slender fingers scarce could hold
4850,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"The wet reins; yea, and scarcely, too,"
4851,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,She felt the foot within her shoe
4852,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Against the stirrup: all for this,"
4853,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,To part at last without a kiss
4854,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Beside the haystack in the floods.
4855,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4856,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"For when they near'd that old soak'd hay,"
4857,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,They saw across the only way
4858,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"That Judas, Godmar, and the three"
4859,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Red running lions dismally
4860,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Grinn'd from his pennon, under which"
4861,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"In one straight line along the ditch,"
4862,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,They counted thirty heads.
4863,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4864,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"So then,"
4865,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"While Robert turn'd round to his men,"
4866,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"She saw at once the wretched end,"
4867,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"And, stooping down, tried hard to rend"
4868,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Her coif the wrong way from her head,"
4869,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And hid her eyes; while Robert said:
4870,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Nay, love, 'tis scarcely two to one,"
4871,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,At Poictiers where we made them run
4872,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"So fast: why, sweet my love, good cheer,"
4873,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"The Gascon frontier is so near,"
4874,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Nought after this.
4875,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4876,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"But: O! she said,"
4877,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,My God! my God! I have to tread
4878,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,The long way back without you; then
4879,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,The court at Paris; those six men;
4880,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,The gratings of the Chatelet;
4881,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,The swift Seine on some rainy day
4882,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Like this, and people standing by,"
4883,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"And laughing, while my weak hands try"
4884,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,To recollect how strong men swim.
4885,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"All this, or else a life with him,"
4886,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"For which I should be damned at last,"
4887,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Would God that this next hour were past!
4888,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4889,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"He answer'd not, but cried his cry,"
4890,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,St. George for Marny! cheerily;
4891,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And laid his hand upon her rein.
4892,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Alas! no man of all his train
4893,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Gave back that cheery cry again;
4894,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"And, while for rage his thumb beat fast"
4895,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Upon his sword-hilt, some one cast"
4896,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"About his neck a kerchief long,"
4897,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And bound him.
4898,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4899,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Then they went along
4900,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"To Godmar; who said: Now, Jehane,"
4901,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Your lover's life is on the wane
4902,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"So fast, that, if this very hour"
4903,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"You yield not as my paramour,"
4904,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,He will not see the rain leave off:
4905,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Nay, keep your tongue from gibe and scoff"
4906,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Sir Robert, or I slay you now."
4907,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4908,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"She laid her hand upon her brow,"
4909,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Then gazed upon the palm, as though"
4910,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"She thought her forehead bled, and: No!"
4911,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"She said, and turn'd her head away,"
4912,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"As there were nothing else to say,"
4913,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And everything were settled: red
4914,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Grew Godmar's face from chin to head:
4915,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Jehane, on yonder hill there stands"
4916,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"My castle, guarding well my lands;"
4917,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"What hinders me from taking you,"
4918,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And doing that I list to do
4919,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"To your fair wilful body, while"
4920,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Your knight lies dead?
4921,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4922,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,A wicked smile
4923,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Wrinkled her face, her lips grew thin,"
4924,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,A long way out she thrust her chin:
4925,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,You know that I should strangle you
4926,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,While you were sleeping; or bite through
4927,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Your throat, by God's help: ah! she said,"
4928,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Lord Jesus, pity your poor maid!"
4929,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"For in such wise they hem me in,"
4930,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"I cannot choose but sin and sin,"
4931,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Whatever happens: yet I think
4932,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"They could not make me eat or drink,"
4933,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And so should I just reach my rest.
4934,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Nay, if you do not my behest,"
4935,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"O Jehane! though I love you well,"
4936,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Said Godmar, would I fail to tell"
4937,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"All that I know? Foul lies, she said."
4938,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Eh? lies, my Jehane? by God's head,"
4939,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,At Paris folks would deem them true!
4940,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Do you know, Jehane, they cry for you:"
4941,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Jehane the brown! Jehane the brown!
4942,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Give us Jehane to burn or drown!
4943,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Eh! gag me Robert! Sweet my friend,"
4944,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,This were indeed a piteous end
4945,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"For those long fingers, and long feet,"
4946,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"And long neck, and smooth shoulders sweet;"
4947,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,An end that few men would forget
4948,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"That saw it. So, an hour yet:"
4949,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Consider, Jehane, which to take"
4950,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Of life or death!
4951,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4952,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"So, scarce awake,"
4953,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Dismounting, did she leave that place,"
4954,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,And totter some yards: with her face
4955,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Turn'd upward to the sky she lay,"
4956,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Her head on a wet heap of hay,"
4957,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"And fell asleep: and while she slept,"
4958,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"And did not dream, the minutes crept"
4959,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Round to the twelve again; but she,"
4960,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Being waked at last, sigh'd quietly,"
4961,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"And strangely childlike came, and said:"
4962,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"I will not. Straightway Godmar's head,"
4963,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"As though it hung on strong wires, turn'd"
4964,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Most sharply round, and his face burn'd."
4965,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4966,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"For Robert, both his eyes were dry,"
4967,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"He could not weep, but gloomily"
4968,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"He seem'd to watch the rain; yea, too,"
4969,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,His lips were firm; he tried once more
4970,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"To touch her lips; she reached out, sore"
4971,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"And vain desire so tortured them,"
4972,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"The poor grey lips, and now the hem"
4973,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Of his sleeve brush'd them.
4974,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4975,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,With a start
4976,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Up Godmar rose, thrust them apart;"
4977,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,From Robert's throat he loosed the bands
4978,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Of silk and mail; with empty hands
4979,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Held out, she stood and gazed, and saw,"
4980,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,The long bright blade without a flaw
4981,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Glide out from Godmar's sheath, his hand"
4982,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,In Robert's hair; she saw him bend
4983,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Back Robert's head; she saw him send
4984,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"The thin steel down; the blow told well,"
4985,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Right backward the knight Robert fell,"
4986,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"And moaned as dogs do, being half dead,"
4987,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Unwitting, as I deem: so then"
4988,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Godmar turn'd grinning to his men,"
4989,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Who ran, some five or six, and beat"
4990,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,His head to pieces at their feet.
4991,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
4992,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Then Godmar turn'd again and said:
4993,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"So, Jehane, the first fitte is read!"
4994,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"Take note, my lady, that your way"
4995,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Lies backward to the Chatelet!
4996,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,She shook her head and gazed awhile
4997,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,"At her cold hands with a rueful smile,"
4998,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,As though this thing had made her mad.
4999,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
5000,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,This was the parting that they had
5001,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,Beside the haystack in the floods.
5002,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
5003,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
5004,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
5005,THE HAYSTACK IN THE FLOODS,
5006,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON
5007,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,
5008,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,
5009,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"There was a lady lived in a hall,"
5010,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"Large of her eyes, and slim and tall;"
5011,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"And ever she sung from noon to noon,"
5012,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,_Two red roses across the moon._
5013,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,
5014,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,There was a knight came riding by
5015,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"In early spring, when the roads were dry;"
5016,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"And he heard that lady sing at the noon,"
5017,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,_Two red roses across the moon._
5018,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,
5019,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"Yet none the more he stopp'd at all,"
5020,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,But he rode a-gallop past the hall;
5021,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"And left that lady singing at noon,"
5022,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,_Two red roses across the moon._
5023,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,
5024,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"Because, forsooth, the battle was set,"
5025,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"And the scarlet and blue had got to be met,"
5026,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,He rode on the spur till the next warm noon:
5027,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,_Two red roses across the moon._
5028,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,
5029,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"But the battle was scatter'd from hill to hill,"
5030,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,From the windmill to the watermill;
5031,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"And he said to himself, as it near'd the noon,"
5032,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,_Two red roses across the moon._
5033,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,
5034,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"You scarce could see for the scarlet and blue,"
5035,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,A golden helm or a golden shoe:
5036,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"So he cried, as the fight grew thick at the noon,"
5037,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,_Two red roses across the moon!_
5038,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,
5039,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,Verily then the gold bore through
5040,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,The huddled spears of the scarlet and blue;
5041,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"And they cried, as they cut them down at the noon,"
5042,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,_Two red roses across the moon!_
5043,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,
5044,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,I trow he stopp'd when he rode again
5045,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,"By the hall, though draggled sore with the rain;"
5046,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,And his lips were pinch'd to kiss at the noon
5047,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,_Two red roses across the moon._
5048,TWO RED ROSES ACROSS THE MOON,

5060,WELLAND RIVER,"Fair Ellayne she walk'd by Welland river,"
5061,WELLAND RIVER,Across the lily lee:
5062,WELLAND RIVER,"O, gentle Sir Robert, ye are not kind"
5063,WELLAND RIVER,To stay so long at sea.
5064,WELLAND RIVER,
5065,WELLAND RIVER,Over the marshland none can see
5066,WELLAND RIVER,Your scarlet pennon fair;
5067,WELLAND RIVER,"O, leave the Easterlings alone,"
5068,WELLAND RIVER,Because of my golden hair.
5069,WELLAND RIVER,
5070,WELLAND RIVER,The day when over Stamford bridge
5071,WELLAND RIVER,That dear pennon I see
5072,WELLAND RIVER,"Go up toward the goodly street,"
5073,WELLAND RIVER,'Twill be a fair day for me.
5074,WELLAND RIVER,
5075,WELLAND RIVER,"O, let the bonny pennon bide"
5076,WELLAND RIVER,"At Stamford, the good town,"
5077,WELLAND RIVER,"And let the Easterlings go free,"
5078,WELLAND RIVER,And their ships go up and down.
5079,WELLAND RIVER,
5080,WELLAND RIVER,For every day that passes by
5081,WELLAND RIVER,"I wax both pale and green,"
5082,WELLAND RIVER,From gold to gold of my girdle
5083,WELLAND RIVER,There is an inch between.
5084,WELLAND RIVER,
5085,WELLAND RIVER,I sew'd it up with scarlet silk
5086,WELLAND RIVER,"Last night upon my knee,"
5087,WELLAND RIVER,And my heart grew sad and sore to think
5088,WELLAND RIVER,Thy face I'd never see.
5089,WELLAND RIVER,
5090,WELLAND RIVER,"I sew'd it up with scarlet silk,"
5091,WELLAND RIVER,As I lay upon my bed:
5092,WELLAND RIVER,Sorrow! the man I'll never see
5093,WELLAND RIVER,That had my maidenhead.
5094,WELLAND RIVER,
5095,WELLAND RIVER,But as Ellayne sat on her window-seat
5096,WELLAND RIVER,"And comb'd her yellow hair,"
5097,WELLAND RIVER,She saw come over Stamford bridge
5098,WELLAND RIVER,The scarlet pennon fair.
5099,WELLAND RIVER,
5100,WELLAND RIVER,"As Ellayne lay and sicken'd sore,"
5101,WELLAND RIVER,"The gold shoes on her feet,"
5102,WELLAND RIVER,She saw Sir Robert and his men
5103,WELLAND RIVER,Ride up the Stamford street.
5104,WELLAND RIVER,
5105,WELLAND RIVER,"He had a coat of fine red gold,"
5106,WELLAND RIVER,And a bascinet of steel;
5107,WELLAND RIVER,Take note his goodly Collayne sword
5108,WELLAND RIVER,Smote the spur upon his heel.
5109,WELLAND RIVER,
5110,WELLAND RIVER,"And by his side, on a grey jennet,"
5111,WELLAND RIVER,"There rode a fair lady,"
5112,WELLAND RIVER,"For every ruby Ellayne wore,"
5113,WELLAND RIVER,I count she carried three.
5114,WELLAND RIVER,
5115,WELLAND RIVER,"Say, was not Ellayne's gold hair fine,"
5116,WELLAND RIVER,That fell to her middle free?
5117,WELLAND RIVER,"But that lady's hair down in the street,"
5118,WELLAND RIVER,Fell lower than her knee.
5119,WELLAND RIVER,
5120,WELLAND RIVER,"Fair Ellayne's face, from sorrow and grief,"
5121,WELLAND RIVER,Was waxen pale and green:
5122,WELLAND RIVER,"That lady's face was goodly red,"
5123,WELLAND RIVER,She had but little tene.
5124,WELLAND RIVER,
5125,WELLAND RIVER,But as he pass'd by her window
5126,WELLAND RIVER,He grew a little wroth:
5127,WELLAND RIVER,"O, why does yon pale face look at me"
5128,WELLAND RIVER,From out the golden cloth?
5129,WELLAND RIVER,
5130,WELLAND RIVER,"It is some burd, the fair dame said,"
5131,WELLAND RIVER,"That aye rode him beside,"
5132,WELLAND RIVER,Has come to see your bonny face
5133,WELLAND RIVER,This merry summer-tide.
5134,WELLAND RIVER,
5135,WELLAND RIVER,But Ellayne let a lily-flower
5136,WELLAND RIVER,Light on his cap of steel:
5137,WELLAND RIVER,"O, I have gotten two hounds, fair knight,"
5138,WELLAND RIVER,The one has served me well;
5139,WELLAND RIVER,
5140,WELLAND RIVER,"But the other, just an hour agone,"
5141,WELLAND RIVER,"Has come from over sea,"
5142,WELLAND RIVER,"And all his fell is sleek and fine,"
5143,WELLAND RIVER,But little he knows of me.
5144,WELLAND RIVER,
5145,WELLAND RIVER,"Now, which shall I let go, fair knight,"
5146,WELLAND RIVER,And which shall bide with me?
5147,WELLAND RIVER,"O, lady, have no doubt to keep"
5148,WELLAND RIVER,The one that best loveth thee.
5149,WELLAND RIVER,
5150,WELLAND RIVER,"O, Robert, see how sick I am!"
5151,WELLAND RIVER,Ye do not so by me.
5152,WELLAND RIVER,"Lie still, fair love, have ye gotten harm"
5153,WELLAND RIVER,While I was on the sea?
5154,WELLAND RIVER,
5155,WELLAND RIVER,"Of one gift, Robert, that ye gave,"
5156,WELLAND RIVER,"I sicken to the death,"
5157,WELLAND RIVER,"I pray you nurse-tend me, my knight,"
5158,WELLAND RIVER,Whiles that I have my breath.
5159,WELLAND RIVER,
5160,WELLAND RIVER,Six fathoms from the Stamford bridge
5161,WELLAND RIVER,"He left that dame to stand,"
5162,WELLAND RIVER,"And whiles she wept, and whiles she cursed"
5163,WELLAND RIVER,That she ever had taken land.
5164,WELLAND RIVER,
5165,WELLAND RIVER,"He has kiss'd sweet Ellayne on the mouth,"
5166,WELLAND RIVER,"And fair she fell asleep,"
5167,WELLAND RIVER,And long and long days after that
5168,WELLAND RIVER,Sir Robert's house she did keep.

5186,RIDING TOGETHER,"We saw the trees in the hot, bright weather,"

5191,RIDING TOGETHER,"And often as we rode together,"
5192,RIDING TOGETHER,"We, looking down the green-bank'd stream,"

5201,RIDING TOGETHER,"Our spears stood bright and thick together,"

5210,RIDING TOGETHER,
5211,RIDING TOGETHER,"Up the sweep of the bridge we dash'd together,"
5212,RIDING TOGETHER,"It rock'd to the crash of the meeting spears,"
5213,RIDING TOGETHER,"Down rain'd the buds of the dear spring weather,"
5214,RIDING TOGETHER,The elm-tree flowers fell like tears.
5215,RIDING TOGETHER,
5216,RIDING TOGETHER,"There, as we roll'd and writhed together,"
5217,RIDING TOGETHER,"I threw my arms above my head,"
5218,RIDING TOGETHER,"For close by my side, in the lovely weather,"
5219,RIDING TOGETHER,I saw him reel and fall back dead.
5220,RIDING TOGETHER,
5221,RIDING TOGETHER,"I and the slayer met together,"
5222,RIDING TOGETHER,"He waited the death-stroke there in his place,"
5223,RIDING TOGETHER,"With thoughts of death, in the lovely weather,"
5224,RIDING TOGETHER,Gapingly mazed at my madden'd face.
5225,RIDING TOGETHER,
5226,RIDING TOGETHER,Madly I fought as we fought together;
5227,RIDING TOGETHER,In vain: the little Christian band
5228,RIDING TOGETHER,"The pagans drown'd, as in stormy weather,"
5229,RIDING TOGETHER,The river drowns low-lying land.
5230,RIDING TOGETHER,
5231,RIDING TOGETHER,"They bound my blood-stain'd hands together,"
5232,RIDING TOGETHER,They bound his corpse to nod by my side:
5233,RIDING TOGETHER,"Then on we rode, in the bright March weather,"
5234,RIDING TOGETHER,With clash of cymbals did we ride.

5489,SUMMER DAWN,Pray but one prayer for me 'twixt thy closed lips;
5490,SUMMER DAWN,Think but one thought of me up in the stars.
5491,SUMMER DAWN,"The summer night waneth, the morning light slips,"
5492,SUMMER DAWN,"Faint and grey 'twixt the leaves of the aspen, betwixt the"
