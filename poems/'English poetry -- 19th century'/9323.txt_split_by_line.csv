124,THUNDERSTORMS,That brood for heavy hours:
125,THUNDERSTORMS,"Until they rain me words,"
126,THUNDERSTORMS,My thoughts are drooping flowers
127,THUNDERSTORMS,"And sulking, silent birds."
128,THUNDERSTORMS,
129,THUNDERSTORMS,"Yet come, dark thunderstorms,"
130,THUNDERSTORMS,And brood your heavy hours;
131,THUNDERSTORMS,"For when you rain me words,"

133,THUNDERSTORMS,And joyful singing birds.

144,STRONG MOMENTS,Judge me to be no strong man then.
145,STRONG MOMENTS,
146,STRONG MOMENTS,The strongest moment of my life
147,STRONG MOMENTS,Is when I think about the poor;
148,STRONG MOMENTS,"When, like a spring that rain has fed,"
149,STRONG MOMENTS,My pity rises more and more.
150,STRONG MOMENTS,
151,STRONG MOMENTS,"The flower that loves the warmth and light,"

160,A GREETING,
161,A GREETING,
162,A GREETING,"Good morning, Life--and all"
163,A GREETING,Things glad and beautiful.
164,A GREETING,"My pockets nothing hold,"
165,A GREETING,"But he that owns the gold,"
166,A GREETING,"The Sun, is my great friend--"
167,A GREETING,His spending has no end.
168,A GREETING,
169,A GREETING,"Hail to the morning sky,"
170,A GREETING,Which bright clouds measure high;
171,A GREETING,Hail to you birds whose throats
172,A GREETING,Would number leaves by notes;
173,A GREETING,"Hail to you shady bowers,"
174,A GREETING,And you green fields of flowers.
175,A GREETING,
176,A GREETING,"Hail to you women fair,"
177,A GREETING,That make a show so rare
178,A GREETING,In cloth as white as milk--
179,A GREETING,Be't calico or silk:
180,A GREETING,"Good morning, Life--and all"
181,A GREETING,Things glad and beautiful.

187,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,
188,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,
189,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"Sweet Stay-at-Home, sweet Well-content,"
190,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Thou knowest of no strange continent:
191,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Thou hast not felt thy bosom keep
192,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,A gentle motion with the deep;
193,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"Thou hast not sailed in Indian seas,"
194,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Where scent comes forth in every breeze.
195,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Thou hast not seen the rich grape grow
196,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"For miles, as far as eyes can go;"
197,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Thou hast not seen a summer's night
198,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,When maids could sew by a worm's light;
199,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Nor the North Sea in spring send out
200,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Bright hues that like birds flit about
201,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,In solid cages of white ice--
202,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"Sweet Stay-at-Home, sweet Love-one-place."
203,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Thou hast not seen black fingers pick
204,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"White cotton when the bloom is thick,"
205,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Nor heard black throats in harmony;
206,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Nor hast thou sat on stones that lie
207,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"Flat on the earth, that once did rise"
208,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"To hide proud kings from common eyes,"
209,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Thou hast not seen plains full of bloom
210,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Where green things had such little room
211,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,They pleased the eye like fairer flowers--
212,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"Sweet Stay-at-Home, all these long hours."
213,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"Sweet Well-content, sweet Love-one-place,"
214,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,"Sweet, simple maid, bless thy dear face;"
215,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,For thou hast made more homely stuff
216,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Nurture thy gentle self enough;
217,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,I love thee for a heart that's kind--
218,SWEET STAY-AT-HOME,Not for the knowledge in thy mind.

225,THE STARVED,
226,THE STARVED,"My little Lamb, what is amiss?"
227,THE STARVED,"If there was milk in mother's kiss,"
228,THE STARVED,You would not look as white as this.
229,THE STARVED,
230,THE STARVED,"The wolf of Hunger, it is he"
231,THE STARVED,"That takes away thy milk from me,"
232,THE STARVED,And I have much to do for thee.
233,THE STARVED,
234,THE STARVED,"If thou couldst live on love, I know"
235,THE STARVED,No babe in all the land could show
236,THE STARVED,More rosy cheeks and louder crow.
237,THE STARVED,
238,THE STARVED,"Thy father's dead, Alas for thee:"
239,THE STARVED,"I cannot keep this wolf from me,"
240,THE STARVED,That takes thy milk so bold and free.
241,THE STARVED,
242,THE STARVED,"If thy dear father lived, he'd drive"
243,THE STARVED,"Away this beast with whom I strive,"
244,THE STARVED,"And thou, my pretty Lamb, wouldst thrive."
245,THE STARVED,
246,THE STARVED,"Ah, my poor babe, my love's so great"
247,THE STARVED,I'd swallow common rags for meat--
248,THE STARVED,If they could make milk rich and sweet.
249,THE STARVED,
250,THE STARVED,"My little Lamb, what is amiss?"
251,THE STARVED,"Come, I must wake thee with a kiss,"
252,THE STARVED,For Death would own a sleep like this.

264,A MAY MORNING,Make happy shadows.
265,A MAY MORNING,
266,A MAY MORNING,Birds in the hedge
267,A MAY MORNING,Are perched and sing;
268,A MAY MORNING,Swallows and larks
269,A MAY MORNING,Are on the wing:
270,A MAY MORNING,Two merry cuckoos
271,A MAY MORNING,Are making echoes.
272,A MAY MORNING,
273,A MAY MORNING,Bird and the beast
274,A MAY MORNING,Have the dew yet;
275,A MAY MORNING,"My road shines dry,"
276,A MAY MORNING,Theirs bright and wet:
277,A MAY MORNING,"Death gives no warning,"
278,A MAY MORNING,On this May morning.
279,A MAY MORNING,
280,A MAY MORNING,I see no Christ
281,A MAY MORNING,"Nailed on a tree,"
282,A MAY MORNING,Dying for sin;
283,A MAY MORNING,No sin I see:
284,A MAY MORNING,"No thoughts for sadness,"
285,A MAY MORNING,All thoughts for gladness.

292,THE LONELY DREAMER,
293,THE LONELY DREAMER,"He lives his lonely life, and when he dies"
294,THE LONELY DREAMER,A thousand hearts maybe will utter sighs;
295,THE LONELY DREAMER,"Because they liked his songs, and now their bird"
296,THE LONELY DREAMER,"Sleeps with his head beneath his wing, unheard."
297,THE LONELY DREAMER,
298,THE LONELY DREAMER,"But what kind hand will tend his grave, and bring"
299,THE LONELY DREAMER,"Those blossoms there, of which he used to sing?"
300,THE LONELY DREAMER,"Who'll kiss his mound, and wish the time would come"
301,THE LONELY DREAMER,To lie with him inside that silent tomb?
302,THE LONELY DREAMER,
303,THE LONELY DREAMER,"And who'll forget the dreamer's skill, and shed"
304,THE LONELY DREAMER,A tear because a loving heart is dead?
305,THE LONELY DREAMER,"Heigh ho for gossip then, and common sighs--"
306,THE LONELY DREAMER,And let his death bring tears in no one's eyes.

313,CHRISTMAS,
314,CHRISTMAS,"Christmas has come, let's eat and drink--"
315,CHRISTMAS,This is no time to sit and think;
316,CHRISTMAS,"Farewell to study, books and pen,"
317,CHRISTMAS,And welcome to all kinds of men.
318,CHRISTMAS,"Let all men now get rid of care,"
319,CHRISTMAS,And what one has let others share;
320,CHRISTMAS,"Then 'tis the same, no matter which"
321,CHRISTMAS,"Of us is poor, or which is rich."
322,CHRISTMAS,"Let each man have enough this day,"
323,CHRISTMAS,Since those that can are glad to pay;
324,CHRISTMAS,There's nothing now too rich or good
325,CHRISTMAS,"For poor men, not the King's own food."
326,CHRISTMAS,Now like a singing bird my feet
327,CHRISTMAS,"Touch earth, and I must drink and eat."
328,CHRISTMAS,Welcome to all men: I'll not care
329,CHRISTMAS,What any of my fellows wear;
330,CHRISTMAS,"We'll not let cloth divide our souls,"
331,CHRISTMAS,They'll swim stark naked in the bowls.
332,CHRISTMAS,"Welcome, poor beggar: I'll not see"
333,CHRISTMAS,"That hand of yours dislodge a flea,--"
334,CHRISTMAS,"While you sit at my side and beg,"
335,CHRISTMAS,Or right foot scratching your left leg.
336,CHRISTMAS,Farewell restraint: we will not now
337,CHRISTMAS,"Measure the ale our brains allow,"
338,CHRISTMAS,But drink as much as we can hold.
339,CHRISTMAS,We'll count no change when we spend gold;
340,CHRISTMAS,"This is no time to save, but spend,"
341,CHRISTMAS,"To give for nothing, not to lend."
342,CHRISTMAS,Let foes make friends: let them forget
343,CHRISTMAS,The mischief-making dead that fret
344,CHRISTMAS,The living with complaint like this--
345,CHRISTMAS,"""He wronged us once, hate him and his."""
346,CHRISTMAS,Christmas has come; let every man
347,CHRISTMAS,"Eat, drink, be merry all he can."
348,CHRISTMAS,"Ale's my best mark, but if port wine"
349,CHRISTMAS,Or whisky's yours--let it be mine;
350,CHRISTMAS,"No matter what lies in the bowls,"
351,CHRISTMAS,We'll make it rich with our own souls.
352,CHRISTMAS,"Farewell to study, books and pen,"
353,CHRISTMAS,And welcome to all kinds of men.

365,LAUGHING ROSE,
366,LAUGHING ROSE,"If I were merry April now,"
367,LAUGHING ROSE,How I would pelt her cheeks with showers;
368,LAUGHING ROSE,"I'd make carnations, rich and warm,"
369,LAUGHING ROSE,Of her vermilion flowers.
370,LAUGHING ROSE,
371,LAUGHING ROSE,"Since she will laugh in April's face,"
372,LAUGHING ROSE,No matter how he rains or blows--

407,THE OLD OAK TREE,You mighty one of all the trees;
408,THE OLD OAK TREE,Within whose hollow trunk a man
409,THE OLD OAK TREE,Could stable his big horse with ease.
410,THE OLD OAK TREE,
411,THE OLD OAK TREE,"I see your knuckles hard and strong,"
412,THE OLD OAK TREE,But have no fear they'll come to blows;
413,THE OLD OAK TREE,"Your life is long, and mine is short,"
414,THE OLD OAK TREE,But which has known the greater woes?
415,THE OLD OAK TREE,
416,THE OLD OAK TREE,"Thou has not seen starved women here,"
417,THE OLD OAK TREE,Or man gone mad because ill-fed--
418,THE OLD OAK TREE,"Who stares at stones in city streets,"
419,THE OLD OAK TREE,Mistaking them for hunks of bread.
420,THE OLD OAK TREE,
421,THE OLD OAK TREE,Thou hast not felt the shivering backs
422,THE OLD OAK TREE,Of homeless children lying down
423,THE OLD OAK TREE,"And sleeping in the cold, night air--"
424,THE OLD OAK TREE,Like doors and walls in London town.
425,THE OLD OAK TREE,
426,THE OLD OAK TREE,"Knowing thou hast not known such shame,"
427,THE OLD OAK TREE,"And only storms have come thy way,"
428,THE OLD OAK TREE,Methinks I could in comfort spend
429,THE OLD OAK TREE,"My summer with thee, day by day."
430,THE OLD OAK TREE,
431,THE OLD OAK TREE,"To lie by day in thy green shade,"
432,THE OLD OAK TREE,And in thy hollow rest at night;

434,THE OLD OAK TREE,The stars turn over leaves of light.

469,LOVE AND THE MUSE,Ten days before his voice was heard by me.
470,LOVE AND THE MUSE,
471,LOVE AND THE MUSE,"Had I an answer from a dear one's lips,"
472,LOVE AND THE MUSE,My love of life would soon regain its power;

474,LOVE AND THE MUSE,And whimper to be nourished every hour.
475,LOVE AND THE MUSE,
476,LOVE AND THE MUSE,"Give me that answer now, and then my Muse,"
477,LOVE AND THE MUSE,"That for my sweet life's sake must never die,"

489,MY YOUTH,It had too many cares
490,MY YOUTH,To think of song;
491,MY YOUTH,My moulting days all came
492,MY YOUTH,When I was young.
493,MY YOUTH,
494,MY YOUTH,"Now, in life's prime, my soul"
495,MY YOUTH,Comes out in flower;

509,SMILES,Till through her parted lips
510,SMILES,There came a flood of light;
511,SMILES,It was the milky way
512,SMILES,Across her face so black:
513,SMILES,"Her two lips closed again,"
514,SMILES,And night came back.
515,SMILES,
516,SMILES,"I see a maiden now,"

1223,RETURN TO NATURE,"While others sleep on hard, cold stones"
1224,RETURN TO NATURE,That suck away their bodies' heat.
1225,RETURN TO NATURE,Where men are drunk in every street;

1228,RETURN TO NATURE,"Where some men freeze for want of cloth,"

1231,RETURN TO NATURE,"Where fine rich ladies wash in milk,"
1232,RETURN TO NATURE,While starving mothers have no food
1233,RETURN TO NATURE,To make them fit in flesh and blood;
1234,RETURN TO NATURE,So that their watery breasts can give
1235,RETURN TO NATURE,Their babies milk and make them live.
1236,RETURN TO NATURE,"Where one man does the work of four,"

1239,RETURN TO NATURE,Doth make their fretful lives as brief.
1240,RETURN TO NATURE,Where ragged men are seen to wait
1241,RETURN TO NATURE,For charity that's small and late;
1242,RETURN TO NATURE,"While others haunt in idle leisure,"
1243,RETURN TO NATURE,Theatre doors to pay for pleasure.
1244,RETURN TO NATURE,No more I'll walk those crowded places
1245,RETURN TO NATURE,And take hot dreams from harlots' faces;

1249,RETURN TO NATURE,"Which, true love absent, burns to dust."
1250,RETURN TO NATURE,Gold's rattle shall not rob my ears
1251,RETURN TO NATURE,Of this sweet music of the spheres.

1268,RETURN TO NATURE,"That have their hearts in rags, and die"

1270,RETURN TO NATURE,"Nay, I have found a life so fine"
1271,RETURN TO NATURE,That every moment seems divine;
1272,RETURN TO NATURE,"By shunning all those pleasures full,"
1273,RETURN TO NATURE,That bring repentance cold and dull.
1274,RETURN TO NATURE,"Such misery seen in days gone by,"
1275,RETURN TO NATURE,"That, made a coward, now I fly"
1276,RETURN TO NATURE,"To green things, like a bird. Alas!"
1277,RETURN TO NATURE,In days gone by I could not pass
1278,RETURN TO NATURE,Ten men but what the eyes of one
1279,RETURN TO NATURE,Would burn me for no kindness done;
1280,RETURN TO NATURE,And wretched women I passed by
1281,RETURN TO NATURE,Sent after me a moan or sigh.
1282,RETURN TO NATURE,"Ah, wretched days: for in that place"
1283,RETURN TO NATURE,"My soul's leaves sought the human face,"
1284,RETURN TO NATURE,And not the Sun's for warmth and light--
1285,RETURN TO NATURE,And so was never free from blight.
1286,RETURN TO NATURE,"But seek me now, and you will find"
1287,RETURN TO NATURE,Me on some soft green bank reclined;
1288,RETURN TO NATURE,"Watching the stately deer close by,"
1289,RETURN TO NATURE,That in a great deep hollow lie
1290,RETURN TO NATURE,Shaking their tails with all the ease
1291,RETURN TO NATURE,"That lambs can. First, look for the trees,"
1292,RETURN TO NATURE,"Then, if you seek me, find me quick."
1293,RETURN TO NATURE,"Seek me no more where men are thick,"
1294,RETURN TO NATURE,But in green lanes where I can walk
1295,RETURN TO NATURE,"A mile, and still no human folk"
1296,RETURN TO NATURE,Tread on my shadow. Seek me where
1297,RETURN TO NATURE,"The strange oak tree is, that can bear"
1298,RETURN TO NATURE,One white-leaved branch among the green--
1299,RETURN TO NATURE,Which many a woodman has not seen.
1300,RETURN TO NATURE,"If you would find me, go where cows"
1301,RETURN TO NATURE,And sheep stand under shady boughs;
1302,RETURN TO NATURE,Where furious squirrels shake a tree
1303,RETURN TO NATURE,As though they'd like to bury me
1304,RETURN TO NATURE,"Under a leaf shower heavy, and"
1305,RETURN TO NATURE,"I laugh at them for spite, and stand."
1306,RETURN TO NATURE,Seek me no more in human ways--
1307,RETURN TO NATURE,Who am a coward since those days
1308,RETURN TO NATURE,"My mind was burned by poor men's eyes,"
1309,RETURN TO NATURE,And frozen by poor women's sighs.
1310,RETURN TO NATURE,"Then send your pearls across the sea,"
1311,RETURN TO NATURE,"Your feathers, scent and ivory,"
1312,RETURN TO NATURE,You distant lands--but let my bales
1313,RETURN TO NATURE,"Be brought by Cuckoos, Nightingales,"
1314,RETURN TO NATURE,That come in spring from your far shores;
1315,RETURN TO NATURE,Sweet birds that carry richer stores
1316,RETURN TO NATURE,"Than men can dream of, when they prize"
1317,RETURN TO NATURE,Fine silks and pearls for merchandise;
1318,RETURN TO NATURE,And dream of ships that take the floods
1319,RETURN TO NATURE,Sunk to their decks with such vain goods;
1320,RETURN TO NATURE,"Bringing that traitor silk, whose soft"
1321,RETURN TO NATURE,Smooth tongue persuades the poor too oft
1322,RETURN TO NATURE,"From sweet content; and pearls, whose fires"
1323,RETURN TO NATURE,Make ashes of our best desires.
1324,RETURN TO NATURE,For I have heard the sighs and whines
1325,RETURN TO NATURE,Of rich men that drink costly wines
1326,RETURN TO NATURE,And eat the best of fish and fowl;
1327,RETURN TO NATURE,"Men that have plenty, and still growl"
1328,RETURN TO NATURE,Because they cannot like kings live--
1329,RETURN TO NATURE,"""Alas!"" they whine, ""we cannot save."""
1330,RETURN TO NATURE,"Since I have heard those rich ones sigh,"
1331,RETURN TO NATURE,"Made poor by their desires so high,"
1332,RETURN TO NATURE,I cherish more a simple mind;
1333,RETURN TO NATURE,That I am well content to find
1334,RETURN TO NATURE,"My pictures in the open air,"
1335,RETURN TO NATURE,And let my walls and floors go bare;
1336,RETURN TO NATURE,That I with lovely things can fill
1337,RETURN TO NATURE,"My rooms, whene'er sweet Fancy will."
1338,RETURN TO NATURE,"I make a fallen tree my chair,"
1339,RETURN TO NATURE,And soon forget no cushion's there;
1340,RETURN TO NATURE,"I lie upon the grass or straw,"
1341,RETURN TO NATURE,And no soft down do I sigh for;
1342,RETURN TO NATURE,For with me all the time I keep
1343,RETURN TO NATURE,"Sweet dreams that, do I wake or sleep,"
1344,RETURN TO NATURE,Shed on me still their kindly beams;
1345,RETURN TO NATURE,"Aye, I am richer with my dreams"
1346,RETURN TO NATURE,Than banks where men dull-eyed and cold
1347,RETURN TO NATURE,Without a tremble shovel gold.
1348,RETURN TO NATURE,A happy life is this. I walk
1349,RETURN TO NATURE,And hear more birds than people talk;
1350,RETURN TO NATURE,"I hear the birds that sing unseen,"
1351,RETURN TO NATURE,On boughs now smothered with leaves green;
1352,RETURN TO NATURE,"I sit and watch the swallows there,"
1353,RETURN TO NATURE,Making a circus in the air;
1354,RETURN TO NATURE,"That speed around straight-going crow,"
1355,RETURN TO NATURE,As sharks around a ship can go;
1356,RETURN TO NATURE,"I hear the skylark out of sight,"
1357,RETURN TO NATURE,Hid perfectly in all this light.
1358,RETURN TO NATURE,"The dappled cows in fields I pass,"
1359,RETURN TO NATURE,Up to their bosoms in deep grass;
1360,RETURN TO NATURE,"Old oak trees, with their bowels gone,"
1361,RETURN TO NATURE,I see with spring's green finery on.
1362,RETURN TO NATURE,"I watch the buzzing bees for hours,"
1363,RETURN TO NATURE,To see them rush at laughing flowers--
1364,RETURN TO NATURE,And butterflies that lie so still.
1365,RETURN TO NATURE,"I see great houses on the hill,"
1366,RETURN TO NATURE,"With shining roofs; and there shines one,"
1367,RETURN TO NATURE,It seems that heaven has dropped the sun.
1368,RETURN TO NATURE,"I see yon cloudlet sail the skies,"
1369,RETURN TO NATURE,Racing with clouds ten times its size.
1370,RETURN TO NATURE,"I walk green pathways, where love waits"
1371,RETURN TO NATURE,To talk in whispers at old gates;
1372,RETURN TO NATURE,"Past stiles--on which I lean, alone--"
1373,RETURN TO NATURE,Carved with the names of lovers gone;
1374,RETURN TO NATURE,I stand on arches whose dark stones
1375,RETURN TO NATURE,Can turn the wind's soft sighs to groans.
1376,RETURN TO NATURE,I hear the Cuckoo when first he
1377,RETURN TO NATURE,"Makes this green world's discovery,"
1378,RETURN TO NATURE,"And re-creates it in my mind,"
1379,RETURN TO NATURE,Proving my eyes were growing blind.
1380,RETURN TO NATURE,I see the rainbow come forth clear
1381,RETURN TO NATURE,And wave her coloured scarf to cheer
1382,RETURN TO NATURE,The sun long swallowed by a flood--
1383,RETURN TO NATURE,So do I live in lane and wood.
1384,RETURN TO NATURE,Let me look forward to each spring
1385,RETURN TO NATURE,As eager as the birds that sing;
1386,RETURN TO NATURE,And feed my eyes on spring's young flowers
1387,RETURN TO NATURE,"Before the bees by many hours,"
1388,RETURN TO NATURE,My heart to leap and sing her praise
1389,RETURN TO NATURE,Before the birds by many days.
1390,RETURN TO NATURE,Go white my hair and skin go dry--
1391,RETURN TO NATURE,But let my heart a dewdrop lie

1408,A STRANGE CITY,"Saw old black gateways, on whose arches crouched"
1409,A STRANGE CITY,Stone lions with their bodies gnawed by age.
1410,A STRANGE CITY,I looked with awe on iron gates that could
1411,A STRANGE CITY,Tell bloody stones if they had our tongues.
1412,A STRANGE CITY,"I saw tall mounted spires shine in the sun,"
1413,A STRANGE CITY,That stood amidst their army of low streets.
1414,A STRANGE CITY,"I saw in buildings pictures, statues rare,"
1415,A STRANGE CITY,"Made in those days when Rome was young, and new"
1416,A STRANGE CITY,In marble quarried from Carrara's hills;
1417,A STRANGE CITY,Statues by sculptors that could almost make
1418,A STRANGE CITY,Fine cobwebs out of stone--so light they worked.
1419,A STRANGE CITY,"Pictures that breathe in us a living soul,"
1420,A STRANGE CITY,Such as we seldom feel come from that life
1421,A STRANGE CITY,The artist copies. Many a lovely sight--
1422,A STRANGE CITY,"Such as the half sunk barge with bales of hay,"
1423,A STRANGE CITY,Or sparkling coals--employed my wondering eyes.
1424,A STRANGE CITY,"I saw old Thames, whose ripples swarmed with stars"
1425,A STRANGE CITY,Bred by the sun on that fine summer's day;
1426,A STRANGE CITY,"I saw in fancy fowl and green banks there,"
1427,A STRANGE CITY,And Liza's barge rowed past a thousand swans.
1428,A STRANGE CITY,I walked in parks and heard sweet music cry
1429,A STRANGE CITY,"In solemn courtyards, midst the men-at-arms;"
1430,A STRANGE CITY,Which suddenly would leap those stony walls
1431,A STRANGE CITY,And spring up with loud laughter into trees.
1432,A STRANGE CITY,I walked in busy streets where music oft
1433,A STRANGE CITY,Went on the march with men; and ofttimes heard
1434,A STRANGE CITY,"The organ in cathedral, when the boys"
1435,A STRANGE CITY,Like nightingales sang in that thunderstorm;
1436,A STRANGE CITY,"The organ, with its rich and solemn tones--"
1437,A STRANGE CITY,As near a God's voice as a man conceives;
1438,A STRANGE CITY,Nor ever dreamt the silent misery
1439,A STRANGE CITY,That solemn organ brought to homeless men.
1440,A STRANGE CITY,"I heard the drums and soft brass instruments,"
1441,A STRANGE CITY,Led by the silver cornets clear and high--
1442,A STRANGE CITY,Whose sounds turned playing children into stones.
1443,A STRANGE CITY,
1444,A STRANGE CITY,"I saw at night the City's lights shine bright,"
1445,A STRANGE CITY,A greater milky way; how in its spell
1446,A STRANGE CITY,It fascinated with ten thousand eyes;
1447,A STRANGE CITY,Like those sweet wiles of an enchantress who
1448,A STRANGE CITY,Would still detain her knight gone cold in love;
1449,A STRANGE CITY,"It was an iceberg with long arms unseen,"
1450,A STRANGE CITY,That felt the deep for vessels far away.
1451,A STRANGE CITY,"All things seemed strange, I stared like any child"
1452,A STRANGE CITY,That pores on some old face and sees a world
1453,A STRANGE CITY,Which its familiar granddad and his dame
1454,A STRANGE CITY,Hid with their love and laughter until then.
1455,A STRANGE CITY,My feet had not yet felt the cruel rocks
1456,A STRANGE CITY,Beneath the pleasant moss I seemed to tread.
1457,A STRANGE CITY,"But soon my ears grew weary of that din,"
1458,A STRANGE CITY,My eyes grew tired of all that flesh and stone;
1459,A STRANGE CITY,"And, as a snail that crawls on a smooth stalk,"
1460,A STRANGE CITY,Will reach the end and find a sharpened thorn--
1461,A STRANGE CITY,So did I reach the cruel end at last.
1462,A STRANGE CITY,"I saw the starving mother and her child,"
1463,A STRANGE CITY,"Who feared that Death would surely end its sleep,"
1464,A STRANGE CITY,And cursed the wolf of Hunger with her moans.
1465,A STRANGE CITY,"And yet, methought, when first I entered there,"
1466,A STRANGE CITY,"Into that city with my wondering mind,"
1467,A STRANGE CITY,How marvellous its many sights and sounds;
1468,A STRANGE CITY,The traffic with its sound of heavy seas
1469,A STRANGE CITY,That have and would again unseat the rocks.
1470,A STRANGE CITY,How common then seemed Nature's hills and fields
1471,A STRANGE CITY,"Compared with these high domes and even streets,"
1472,A STRANGE CITY,And churches with white towers and bodies black.
1473,A STRANGE CITY,The traffic's sound was music to my ears;
1474,A STRANGE CITY,"A sound of where the white waves, hour by hour,"
1475,A STRANGE CITY,Attack a reef of coral rising yet;
1476,A STRANGE CITY,"Or where a mighty warship in a fog,"
1477,A STRANGE CITY,Steams into a large fleet of little boats.
1478,A STRANGE CITY,"Aye, and that fog was strange and wonderful,"
1479,A STRANGE CITY,That made men blind and grope their way at noon.
1480,A STRANGE CITY,"I saw that City with fierce human surge,"
1481,A STRANGE CITY,With millions of dark waves that still spread out
1482,A STRANGE CITY,To swallow more of their green boundaries.
1483,A STRANGE CITY,"Then came a day that noise so stirred my soul,"
1484,A STRANGE CITY,"I called them hellish sounds, and thought red war"
1485,A STRANGE CITY,Was better far than peace in such a town.
1486,A STRANGE CITY,
1487,A STRANGE CITY,"To hear that din all day, sometimes my mind"
1488,A STRANGE CITY,"Went crazed, and it seemed strange, as I were lost"
1489,A STRANGE CITY,In some vast forest full of chattering apes.
1490,A STRANGE CITY,"How sick I grew to hear that lasting noise,"
1491,A STRANGE CITY,"And all those people forced across my sight,"
1492,A STRANGE CITY,Knowing the acres of green fields and woods
1493,A STRANGE CITY,That in some country parts outnumbered men;
1494,A STRANGE CITY,In half an hour ten thousand men I passed--
1495,A STRANGE CITY,More than nine thousand should have been green trees.
1496,A STRANGE CITY,There on a summer's day I saw such crowds
1497,A STRANGE CITY,That where there was no man man's shadow was;
1498,A STRANGE CITY,"Millions all cramped together in one hive,"
1499,A STRANGE CITY,"Storing, methought, more bitter stuff than sweet."
1500,A STRANGE CITY,The air was foul and stale; from their green homes
1501,A STRANGE CITY,"Young blood had brought its fresh and rosy cheeks,"
1502,A STRANGE CITY,"Which soon turned colour, like blue streams in flood."
1503,A STRANGE CITY,"Aye, solitude, black solitude indeed,"
1504,A STRANGE CITY,To meet a million souls and know not one;
1505,A STRANGE CITY,This world must soon grow stale to one compelled
1506,A STRANGE CITY,To look all day at faces strange and cold.
1507,A STRANGE CITY,Oft full of smoke that town; its summer's day
1508,A STRANGE CITY,Was darker than a summer's night at sea;
1509,A STRANGE CITY,"Poison was there, and still men rushed for it,"
1510,A STRANGE CITY,Like cows for acorns that have made them sick.
1511,A STRANGE CITY,"That town was rich and old; man's flesh was cheap,"
1512,A STRANGE CITY,But common earth was dear to buy one foot.
1513,A STRANGE CITY,"If I must be fenced in, then let my fence"
1514,A STRANGE CITY,"Be some green hedgerow; under its green sprays,"
1515,A STRANGE CITY,"That shake suspended, let me walk in joy--"
1516,A STRANGE CITY,"As I do now, in these dear months I love."
1517,A STRANGE CITY,
1518,A STRANGE CITY,
1519,A STRANGE CITY,
1520,A STRANGE CITY,
1521,A STRANGE CITY,
1522,A STRANGE CITY,
1523,A STRANGE CITY,
1524,A STRANGE CITY,
1525,A STRANGE CITY,
