57,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
58,PREFACE.,
59,PREFACE.,
60,PREFACE.,"If the general public, acquainted only with the comic works of THOMAS"
61,PREFACE.,"HOOD, were taken by surprise when they found how he could handle serious"
62,PREFACE.,and solemn themes; those who saw him in the flesh must have been equally
63,PREFACE.,astonished to learn how grave and melancholy a man the famous wit was to
64,PREFACE.,"all appearance. The chronic ill health, which gave this expression to"
65,PREFACE.,"his countenance, was, however, powerless to affect the tone of his mind."
66,PREFACE.,“Here lies one who spat more blood and made more puns than any man
67,PREFACE.,"living,” was the epitaph he half-jestingly proposed for himself. The"
68,PREFACE.,connection between the disease and the comic faculty is not so
69,PREFACE.,"unreasonable as it appears at first. The invalid, who could supply mirth"
70,PREFACE.,for millions while he himself was propped up with pillows on the bed of
71,PREFACE.,"sickness, was not a jester whose sole stock in trade consisted in mere"
72,PREFACE.,"animal spirits--which are too often mistaken for wit, but have in common"
73,PREFACE.,with other spirits a tendency to evaporate somewhat rapidly. HOOD’S wit
74,PREFACE.,"was the fruit of an even temperament, a cheery and contented mind"
75,PREFACE.,endowed with a keen appreciation of the ludicrous. This acute perception
76,PREFACE.,"of what is ludicrous is the foundation of all wit, but it may influence"
77,PREFACE.,the mind in two ways. It may render its possessor as indifferent to the
78,PREFACE.,feelings as it makes him alive to the failings of others. How often
79,PREFACE.,"does the wit, delighting in the flash and report of his jest, forget the"
80,PREFACE.,wound it may inflict!
81,PREFACE.,
82,PREFACE.,"But, on the other hand, the shrewd appreciation of the weaknesses of"
83,PREFACE.,others assists a kindly and well-balanced mind to avoid the infliction
84,PREFACE.,of pain; and the wit of THOMAS HOOD was of this nature. It was all the
85,PREFACE.,brighter because it was never stained by a tear wantonly caused. Even
86,PREFACE.,the temptations of practical joking--and they have a strong influence on
87,PREFACE.,those who enjoy the comic side of things--never betrayed him into any
88,PREFACE.,"freak that could give pain. He worked away industriously with wood,"
89,PREFACE.,"paint, and glue to send his friend FRANCK a new and killing bait for the"
90,PREFACE.,"early spring--a veritable _Poisson d’Avril_, constructed to come in"
91,PREFACE.,"half after a brief immersion, and reveal the inscription, “Oh, you April"
92,PREFACE.,"Fool!” He could gravely persuade his young wife, when she was first"
93,PREFACE.,"learning the mysteries of housekeeping, that she must never purchase"
94,PREFACE.,"plaice with red spots, for they were a proof that the fish were not"
95,PREFACE.,fresh. But he was incapable of any of the cruel pleasantries for which
96,PREFACE.,"THEODORE HOOK was famous: indeed, the only person he ever frightened,"
97,PREFACE.,"even, with a practical joke, was himself; when as a boy he traced with"
98,PREFACE.,the smoke of a candle on the ceiling of a passage outside his bedroom a
99,PREFACE.,"diabolical face, which was intended to startle his brother, but which so"
100,PREFACE.,"alarmed the artist himself, when he was going to bed forgetful of his"
101,PREFACE.,"own feat, that he ran down stairs--in a panic and in his"
102,PREFACE.,night-dress--into the presence of his father’s guests assembled in the
103,PREFACE.,drawing-room. He used to enjoy so heartily and chuckle so merrily over
104,PREFACE.,his innocent practical jokes and hoaxes (he was never more delighted
105,PREFACE.,than when a friend of his was completely imposed on by a sham account of
106,PREFACE.,a survey of the Heavens through Lord ROSSE’S “monster telescope”) that
107,PREFACE.,the tenderness he showed for the feelings of others is more remarkable.
108,PREFACE.,The same forbearance characterises his writings. In spite of many and
109,PREFACE.,"great provocations, he seldom, or never, wrote a bitter word, though"
110,PREFACE.,that he could have been severe is amply indicated in his “Ode to RAE
111,PREFACE.,"WILSON,” or still more in certain letters on “Copyright and Copywrong,”"
112,PREFACE.,which he was spurred on by injustice and ill-usage to address to the
113,PREFACE.,"_Athenæum_. He was a Shandean, who carried out in his life as well as"
114,PREFACE.,his writings the principles which STERNE confined to the latter.
115,PREFACE.,
116,PREFACE.,The first appearance of THOMAS HOOD as a comic writer was in the year
117,PREFACE.,"1826, when he published the First Series of “Whims and Oddities.” The"
118,PREFACE.,"critics in many instances took offence at his puns, as might have been"
119,PREFACE.,"expected, for his style was new and startling. His book was full of"
120,PREFACE.,"word-play, and it is easy to conceive--as he wrote in his address to the"
121,PREFACE.,Second Edition--“how gentlemen with one idea were perplexed with a
122,PREFACE.,"double meaning.” However, the public approved if the critics did not,"
123,PREFACE.,"and called for a second and soon after a third edition. Finally, after"
124,PREFACE.,"the publication of a second series, a fourth issue, containing the two"
125,PREFACE.,"series in one volume, was demanded. “Come what may,” said HOOD, “this"
126,PREFACE.,little book will now leave four imprints behind it--and a horse could do
127,PREFACE.,no more!”
128,PREFACE.,
129,PREFACE.,"He had by this time commenced the Comic Annuals, a series which he"
130,PREFACE.,"carried on for many years, and by which he established his fame as the"
131,PREFACE.,first wit and humourist of his day. When this publication ceased he
132,PREFACE.,"wrote first for _Colburn’s New Monthly_, of which he was appointed"
133,PREFACE.,"Editor on HOOK’S death; and subsequently, and up to the time of his"
134,PREFACE.,"death, in his own periodical, _Hood’s Magazine_."
135,PREFACE.,
136,PREFACE.,"Puns have been styled the lowest form of wit, and the critics have"
137,PREFACE.,fallen foul of them from time immemorial until the present day. But a
138,PREFACE.,"pun proper--and there should be a strict definition of a pun--is, it is"
139,PREFACE.,"humbly submitted, of so complicated a nature as to be anything but a low"
140,PREFACE.,"form of wit. A mere jingle of similar sounds, or a distortion of"
141,PREFACE.,pronunciation does not constitute a pun--a double meaning is essential
142,PREFACE.,to its existence--a play of sense as well as of sound. That the latter
143,PREFACE.,was in HOOD’S opinion the more important feature of the two is to be
144,PREFACE.,inferred from his statement that “a pun is something like a cherry:
145,PREFACE.,though there may be a slight outward indication of partition--of
146,PREFACE.,"duplicity of meaning, yet no gentleman need make two bites at it"
147,PREFACE.,"against his own pleasure.” In other words, the sense is complete without"
148,PREFACE.,"any reference to the second meaning. Tested by this rule, the majority"
149,PREFACE.,"of so-called puns, which have brought discredit on punning, would be"
150,PREFACE.,"immediately condemned, the only excuse for the form in which they are"
151,PREFACE.,"written being the endeavour to tack on a second meaning, or too often"
152,PREFACE.,only an echo of sound without meaning.
153,PREFACE.,
154,PREFACE.,Perhaps the best defence of punning is to be found in the following
155,PREFACE.,stanzas of “Miss Kilmansegg:”
156,PREFACE.,
157,PREFACE.,"“There’s strength in double joints, no doubt,"
158,PREFACE.,"In double X Ale, and Dublin Stout,"
159,PREFACE.,That the single sorts know nothing about--
160,PREFACE.,And the fist is strongest when doubled--
161,PREFACE.,"And double aqua-fortis, of course,"
162,PREFACE.,"And double soda-water, perforce,"
163,PREFACE.,Are the strongest that ever bubbled!
164,PREFACE.,
165,PREFACE.,“There’s double beauty whenever a Swan
166,PREFACE.,"Swims on a Lake, with her double thereon;"
167,PREFACE.,"And ask the gardener, Luke or John,"
168,PREFACE.,Of the beauty of double-blowing--
169,PREFACE.,A double dahlia delights the eye;
170,PREFACE.,And it’s far the loveliest sight in the sky
171,PREFACE.,When a double rainbow is glowing!
172,PREFACE.,
173,PREFACE.,“There’s warmth in a pair of double soles;
174,PREFACE.,As well as a double allowance of coals--
175,PREFACE.,In a coat that is double-breasted--
176,PREFACE.,In double windows and double doors;
177,PREFACE.,And a double U wind is blest by scores
178,PREFACE.,For its warmth to the tender-chested.
179,PREFACE.,
180,PREFACE.,“There’s a twofold sweetness in double pipes;
181,PREFACE.,And a double barrel and double snipes
182,PREFACE.,Give the sportsman a duplicate pleasure;
183,PREFACE.,There’s double safety in double locks;
184,PREFACE.,And double letters bring cash for the box;
185,PREFACE.,And all the world knows that double knocks
186,PREFACE.,Are gentility’s double measure.
187,PREFACE.,
188,PREFACE.,"“There’s double sweetness in double rhymes,"
189,PREFACE.,And a double at Whist and a double Times
190,PREFACE.,In profit are certainly double--
191,PREFACE.,"By doubling, the hare contrives to escape;"
192,PREFACE.,"And all seamen delight in a doubled Cape,"
193,PREFACE.,And a double-reef’d topsail in trouble.
194,PREFACE.,
195,PREFACE.,"“There’s a double chuck at a double chin,"
196,PREFACE.,"And of course there’s a double pleasure therein,"
197,PREFACE.,If the parties were brought to telling:
198,PREFACE.,"And however our Denises take offence,"
199,PREFACE.,_A double meaning shows double sense_;
200,PREFACE.,"And if proverbs tell truth,"
201,PREFACE.,A double tooth
202,PREFACE.,Is Wisdom’s adopted dwelling!”
203,PREFACE.,
204,PREFACE.,The reputation of THOMAS HOOD as a wit and humourist rests on his
205,PREFACE.,"writings chiefly. His recorded sayings are few, for in general society"
206,PREFACE.,"he was shy and reserved, seldom making a joke, or doing it with so grave"
207,PREFACE.,"a face that the witticism seemed an accident, and was in many cases"
208,PREFACE.,"possibly allowed to pass unnoticed, for a great number of people do not"
209,PREFACE.,recognise a joke that is not prefaced by a jingle of the cap and bells.
210,PREFACE.,"When in the company of a few intimate friends, however, he was full of"
211,PREFACE.,"fun and good spirits. Unfortunately, on such occasions the good things"
212,PREFACE.,"were not “set in a note-book,” and so were for the most part lost;"
213,PREFACE.,"though at times an anecdote, well-authenticated, turns up to make us"
214,PREFACE.,regret that more have not been preserved.
215,PREFACE.,
216,PREFACE.,"One such anecdote, which has not hitherto appeared in print, may not be"
217,PREFACE.,out of place here. HOOD and “PETER PRIGGINS”--the Rev. Mr. HEWLETT--went
218,PREFACE.,"on a visit to a friend of the latter’s, residing near Ramsgate. As they"
219,PREFACE.,drove out of the town they passed a board on which was printed in large
220,PREFACE.,letters
221,PREFACE.,
222,BEWARE THE DOG.,BEWARE THE DOG.
223,BEWARE THE DOG.,
224,BEWARE THE DOG.,A glance at the premises which the announcement was intended to guard
225,BEWARE THE DOG.,"showed that the quadruped was not forthcoming, whereupon HOOD jumped out"
226,BEWARE THE DOG.,"of the gig, and, picking up a bit of chalk (plentiful enough in the"
227,BEWARE THE DOG.,"neighbourhood), wrote under the warning--"
228,BEWARE THE DOG.,
229,WARE BE THE DOG?,WARE BE THE DOG?
230,WARE BE THE DOG?,
231,WARE BE THE DOG?,These introductory remarks cannot be better wound-up than by a quotation
232,WARE BE THE DOG?,"from a preface to “HOOD’S Own,” in which is laid down the system of"
233,WARE BE THE DOG?,"“Practical Cheerful Philosophy,” which is reflected in his writings, and"
234,WARE BE THE DOG?,which influenced his life. The reader will more thoroughly appreciate
235,WARE BE THE DOG?,the comic writings of THOMAS HOOD after its perusal:
236,WARE BE THE DOG?,
237,WARE BE THE DOG?,"In the absence of a certain thin “blue and yellow” visage, and"
238,WARE BE THE DOG?,"attenuated figure,--whose effigies may one day be affixed to the"
239,WARE BE THE DOG?,"present work,--you will not be prepared to learn that some of the"
240,WARE BE THE DOG?,merriest effusions in the forthcoming numbers have been the
241,WARE BE THE DOG?,relaxations of a gentleman literally enjoying bad health--the
242,WARE BE THE DOG?,"carnival, so to speak, of a personified Jour Maigre. The very"
243,WARE BE THE DOG?,"fingers so aristocratically slender, that now hold the pen, hint"
244,WARE BE THE DOG?,plainly of the “_ills_ that _flesh_ is heir to:”--my coats have
245,WARE BE THE DOG?,"become great coats, my pantaloons are turned into trowsers, and, by"
246,WARE BE THE DOG?,"a worse bargain than Peter Schemihl’s, I seem to have retained my"
247,WARE BE THE DOG?,"shadow and sold my substance. In short, as happens to prematurely"
248,WARE BE THE DOG?,"old port wine, I am of a bad colour with very little body. But what"
249,WARE BE THE DOG?,then? That emaciated hand still lends a hand to embody in words and
250,WARE BE THE DOG?,sketches the creations or recreations of a Merry Fancy: those gaunt
251,WARE BE THE DOG?,sides yet shake heartily as ever at the Grotesques and Arabesques
252,WARE BE THE DOG?,and droll Picturesques that my good Genius (a Pantagruelian
253,WARE BE THE DOG?,Familiar) charitably conjures up to divert me from more sombre
254,WARE BE THE DOG?,"realities. It was the whim of a late pleasant Comedian, to suppose"
255,WARE BE THE DOG?,"a set of spiteful imps sitting up aloft, to aggravate all his petty"
256,WARE BE THE DOG?,mundane annoyances; whereas I prefer to believe in the ministry of
257,WARE BE THE DOG?,kindlier Elves that “nod to me and do me courtesies.” Instead of
258,WARE BE THE DOG?,"scaring away these motes in the sunbeam, I earnestly invoke them,"
259,WARE BE THE DOG?,and bid them welcome; for the tricksy spirits make friends with the
260,WARE BE THE DOG?,"animal spirits, and do not I, like a father romping with his own"
261,WARE BE THE DOG?,"urchins,--do not I forget half my cares whilst partaking in their"
262,WARE BE THE DOG?,airy gambols? Such sports are as wholesome for the mind as the
263,WARE BE THE DOG?,other frolics for the body. For on our own treatment of that
264,WARE BE THE DOG?,"excellent Friend or terrible Enemy the Imagination, it depends"
265,WARE BE THE DOG?,"whether we are to be scared and haunted by a Scratching Fanny, or"
266,WARE BE THE DOG?,"tended by an affectionate Invisible Girl--like an unknown Love,"
267,WARE BE THE DOG?,"blessing us with “favours secret, sweet, and precious,” and fondly"
268,WARE BE THE DOG?,stealing us from this worky-day world to a sunny sphere of her own.
269,WARE BE THE DOG?,
270,WARE BE THE DOG?,"This is a novel version, Reader, of “Paradise and the Peri,” but it"
271,WARE BE THE DOG?,is as true as it is new. How else could I have converted a serious
272,WARE BE THE DOG?,illness into a comic wellness--by what other agency could I have
273,WARE BE THE DOG?,"transported myself, as a Cockney would say, from _Dull_age to"
274,WARE BE THE DOG?,_Grin_nage? It was far from a practical joke to be laid up in
275,WARE BE THE DOG?,"ordinary in a foreign land, under the care of Physicians quite as"
276,WARE BE THE DOG?,"much abroad as myself with the case; indeed, the shades of the"
277,WARE BE THE DOG?,"gloaming were stealing over my prospect; but I resolved, that, like"
278,WARE BE THE DOG?,"the sun, so long as my day lasted, I would look on the bright side"
279,WARE BE THE DOG?,"of everything. The raven croaked, but I persuaded myself that it"
280,WARE BE THE DOG?,"was the nightingale! there was the smell of the mould, but I"
281,WARE BE THE DOG?,remembered that it nourished the violets. However my body might cry
282,WARE BE THE DOG?,"craven, my mind luckily had no mind to give in. So, instead of"
283,WARE BE THE DOG?,"mounting on the black long-tailed coach horse, she vaulted on her"
284,WARE BE THE DOG?,"old Hobby that had capered in the Morris-Dance, and began to exhort"
285,WARE BE THE DOG?,"from its back. To be sure, said she, matters look darkly enough;"
286,WARE BE THE DOG?,but the more need for the lights. Allons! Courage! Things may take
287,WARE BE THE DOG?,"a turn, as the pig said on the spit. Never throw down your cards,"
288,WARE BE THE DOG?,"but play out the game. The more certain to lose, the wiser to get"
289,WARE BE THE DOG?,all the play you can for your money. Come--give us a song! chirp
290,WARE BE THE DOG?,"away like that best of cricket-players, the cricket himself. Be"
291,WARE BE THE DOG?,"bowled out or caught out, but never throw down the bat. As to"
292,WARE BE THE DOG?,"Health, it’s the weather of the body--it hails, it rains, it blows,"
293,WARE BE THE DOG?,"it snows, at present, but it may clear up by-and-bye. You cannot"
294,WARE BE THE DOG?,"eat, you say, and you must not drink; but laugh and make believe,"
295,WARE BE THE DOG?,"like the Barber’s wise brother at the Barmecide’s feast. Then, as"
296,WARE BE THE DOG?,"to thinness, not to flatter, you look like a lath that has had a"
297,WARE BE THE DOG?,split with the carpenter and a fall out with the plaster; but so
298,WARE BE THE DOG?,much the better: remember how the smugglers trim the sails of the
299,WARE BE THE DOG?,lugger to escape the notice of the cutter. Turn your edge to the
300,WARE BE THE DOG?,"old enemy, and mayhap he won’t see you! Come--be alive! You have no"
301,WARE BE THE DOG?,more right to slight your life than to neglect your wife--they are
302,WARE BE THE DOG?,the two better halves that make a man of you! Is not life your
303,WARE BE THE DOG?,"means of living? So stick to thy business, and thy business will"
304,WARE BE THE DOG?,"stick to thee. Of course, continued my mind, I am quite"
305,WARE BE THE DOG?,disinterested in this advice--for I am aware of my own
306,WARE BE THE DOG?,"immortality--but for that very reason, take care of the mortal"
307,WARE BE THE DOG?,"body, poor body, and give it as long a day as you can."
308,WARE BE THE DOG?,
309,WARE BE THE DOG?,"Now, my mind seeming to treat the matter very pleasantly as well as"
310,WARE BE THE DOG?,"profitably, I followed her counsel, and instead of calling out for"
311,WARE BE THE DOG?,"relief according to the fable, I kept along on my journey, with my"
312,WARE BE THE DOG?,"bundle of sticks,--_i.e._, my arms and legs. Between ourselves, it"
313,WARE BE THE DOG?,"would have been “extremely inconvenient,” as I once heard the"
314,WARE BE THE DOG?,"opium-eater declare, to pay the debt of nature at that particular"
315,WARE BE THE DOG?,"juncture; nor do I quite know, to be candid, when it would"
316,WARE BE THE DOG?,"altogether suit me to settle it, so, like other persons in narrow"
317,WARE BE THE DOG?,"circumstances, I laughed, and gossipped, and played the agreeable"
318,WARE BE THE DOG?,"with all my might, and as such pleasant behaviour sometimes obtains"
319,WARE BE THE DOG?,"a respite from a human creditor, who knows but that it may prove"
320,WARE BE THE DOG?,"successful with the Universal Mortgagee? At all events, here I am,"
321,WARE BE THE DOG?,humming “Jack’s Alive!” and my own dear skilful native physician
322,WARE BE THE DOG?,gives me hopes of a longer lease than appeared from the foreign
323,WARE BE THE DOG?,"reading of the covenants. He declares, indeed, that, anatomically,"
324,WARE BE THE DOG?,my heart is lower hung than usual--but what of that? _The more need
325,WARE BE THE DOG?,to keep it up!_

2393,AN OPEN QUESTION.,

2397,AN OPEN QUESTION.,"into the bloody house of life,” or the breaking into a brick-built"
2398,AN OPEN QUESTION.,dwelling. They all originate in the breaking of the Sabbath. It is
2399,AN OPEN QUESTION.,the source of every crime in the country--the parent of every
2400,AN OPEN QUESTION.,illegitimate child in the parish. The picking of a pocket is
2401,AN OPEN QUESTION.,ascribed to the picking of a daisy--the robbery on the highway to a
2402,AN OPEN QUESTION.,stroll in the fields--the incendiary fire to a hot dinner--on
2403,AN OPEN QUESTION.,Sunday. All other causes--the want of education--the want of moral

4138,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"“It’s very hard,” she used to moan,"

4144,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
4145,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,She had a lake--a pond I mean--
4146,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,It’s wave was rather thick than pearly--
4147,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"She had two ducks, their napes were green--"
4148,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"She had a drake, his tail was curly,--"
4149,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Yet spite of drake, and ducks, and pond,"

4151,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
4152,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,The birds were both the best of mothers--

4161,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"They sank ere long right under water,"
4162,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Like any overloaded boat;

4175,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"For little ducks, beyond conviction,"

4186,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,

4191,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Whene’er they launched--oh sight of wonder!
4192,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Like fires the water “got them under!”
4193,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
4194,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,No woman ever gave their lucks
4195,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,A better chance than Mrs. Bond did;
4196,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"At last quite out of heart and ducks,"
4197,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,She gave her pond up and desponded;
4198,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"For Death among the water lilies,"
4199,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Cried “_Duc_ ad me,” to all her dillies."
4200,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
4201,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"But though resolved to breed no more,"
4202,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,She brooded often on this riddle--
4203,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Alas! twas darker than before!
4204,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"At last, about the summer’s middle,"
4205,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"What Johnson, Mrs. Bond, or none did,"
4206,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,To clear the matter up the sun did!
4207,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
4208,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"The thirsty Sirius, dog-like, drank"
4209,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"So deep his furious tongue to cool,"

4211,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"And lo, from out the wasted pool,"
4212,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Too hot to hold them any longer,"
4213,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,There crawled some eels as big as conger!
4214,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
4215,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"I wish all folks would look a bit,"
4216,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,In such a case below the surface;
4217,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,But when the eels were caught and split
4218,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"By Mrs. Bond, just think of _her_ face,"
4219,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,In each inside at once to spy
4220,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,A duckling turned to giblet pie!
4221,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
4222,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"The sight at once explained the case,"

4224,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,The tenants of that _Eely Place_
4225,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Had found the way to _Pick a dilly_,"

6819,THE CHINA MENDER.,"Missis wouldn’t have an angel, if he was careless about Chiney;"
6820,THE CHINA MENDER.,"She never forgives a chip, if it’s ever so small and tiny."
6821,THE CHINA MENDER.,Lawk! I never saw a man in all my life in such a taking;

6835,THE CHINA MENDER.,"Well! you think the things will mend--if they won’t, Lord mend us all!"
6836,THE CHINA MENDER.,"My Lady will go in fits, and Mr. Lambert won’t need to call:"
6837,THE CHINA MENDER.,"I’ll be bound in any money, if I had a guinea to give,"
6838,THE CHINA MENDER.,He won’t sit down again on Chiney the longest day he has to live.
6839,THE CHINA MENDER.,"Poor soul! I only hope it won’t forbid his bans of marriage,"

6842,THE CHINA MENDER.,"I’ll look in twice a day, just to see, like, how they mend."
6843,THE CHINA MENDER.,To be sure it is a sight that might draw tears from dogs and cats;
6844,THE CHINA MENDER.,"Here’s this pretty little pagoda, now, has lost four of its cocked hats:"
6845,THE CHINA MENDER.,Be particular with the pagoda: and then here’s this pretty bowl--
6846,THE CHINA MENDER.,The Chinese Prince is making love to nothing because of this hole;
6847,THE CHINA MENDER.,"And here’s another Chinese man, with a face just like a doll--"
6848,THE CHINA MENDER.,"Do stick his pigtail on again, and just mend his parasol."
6849,THE CHINA MENDER.,"But I needn’t tell you what to do; only do it out of hand,"
6850,THE CHINA MENDER.,And charge whatever you like to charge--my Lady won’t make a stand.
6851,THE CHINA MENDER.,"Well! good morning, Mr. What-d’ye-call; for it’s time our gossip ended:"

7118,RURAL FELICITY.,Tho’ as yet all I’ve seen of a pastoral life only makes me more partial to town.
7119,RURAL FELICITY.,
7120,RURAL FELICITY.,"At first I thought I was really come down into all sorts of rural bliss,"
7121,RURAL FELICITY.,"For Porkington Place, with its cows and its pigs, and its poultry, looks not much amiss;"
7122,RURAL FELICITY.,"There’s something about a dairy farm, with its different kinds of live stock,"
7123,RURAL FELICITY.,"That puts one in mind of Paradise, and Adam, and his innocent flock;"
7124,RURAL FELICITY.,"But somehow the good old Elysium fields have not been well handed down,"
7125,RURAL FELICITY.,And as yet I have found no fields to prefer to dear Leicester Fields up in town.
7126,RURAL FELICITY.,
7127,RURAL FELICITY.,"To be sure it is pleasant to walk in the meads, and so I should like for miles,"
7128,RURAL FELICITY.,If it wasn’t for clodpoles of carpenters that put up such crooked stiles;
7129,RURAL FELICITY.,"For the bars jut out, and you must jut out, till you’re almost broken in two,"
7130,RURAL FELICITY.,"If you clamber you’re certain sure of a fall, and you stick if you try to creep through."
7131,RURAL FELICITY.,"Of course, in the end, one learns how to climb without constant tumbles-down,"
7132,RURAL FELICITY.,"But still as to walking so stylishly, it’s pleasanter done about town."
7133,RURAL FELICITY.,"There’s a way, I know, to avoid the stiles, and that’s by a walk in a lane,"
7134,RURAL FELICITY.,"And I did find a very nice shady one, but I never dared go again;"
7135,RURAL FELICITY.,"For who should I meet but a rampaging bull, that wouldn’t be kept in the pound,"
7136,RURAL FELICITY.,"A trying to toss the whole world at once, by sticking his horns in the ground?"
7137,RURAL FELICITY.,"And that, by-the-bye, is another thing, that pulls rural pleasures down,"
7138,RURAL FELICITY.,"Ev’ry day in the country is cattle-day, and there’s only two up in town."
7139,RURAL FELICITY.,
7140,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then I’ve rose with the sun, to go brushing away at the first early pearly dew,"
7141,RURAL FELICITY.,"And to meet Aurory, or whatever’s her name, and I always got wetted through;"
7142,RURAL FELICITY.,"My shoes are like sops, and I caught a bad cold, and a nice draggle-tail to my"
7143,RURAL FELICITY.,"gown,"
7144,RURAL FELICITY.,"That’s not the way that we bathe our feet, or wear our pearls, up in town!"
7145,RURAL FELICITY.,"As for picking flowers, I have tried at a hedge, sweet eglantine roses to snatch,"
7146,RURAL FELICITY.,"But, mercy on us! how nettles will sting, and how the long brambles do scratch;"
7147,RURAL FELICITY.,"Beside hitching my hat on a nasty thorn that tore all the bows from the crown,"
7148,RURAL FELICITY.,"One may walk long enough without hats branching off, or losing one’s bows about town."
7149,RURAL FELICITY.,"But worse than that, in a long rural walk, suppose that it blows up for rain,"
7150,RURAL FELICITY.,And all at once you discover yourself in a real St. Swithin’s Lane;
7151,RURAL FELICITY.,"And while you’re running all duck’d and drown’d, and pelted with sixpenny drops,"
7152,RURAL FELICITY.,"“Fine weather,” you hear the farmers say; “a nice growing shower for the crops!”"
7153,RURAL FELICITY.,"But who’s to crop me another new hat, or grow me another new gown?"
7154,RURAL FELICITY.,For you can’t take a shilling fare with a plough as you do with the hackneys in town.
7155,RURAL FELICITY.,
7156,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then my nevys too, they must drag me off to go with them gathering nuts,"
7157,RURAL FELICITY.,And we always set out by the longest way and return by the shortest cuts.
7158,RURAL FELICITY.,"Short cuts, indeed! But it’s nuts to them, to get a poor lustyish aunt"
7159,RURAL FELICITY.,"To scramble through gaps, or jump over a ditch, when they’re morally certain she can’t,--"
7160,RURAL FELICITY.,"For whenever I get in some awkward scrape, and it’s almost daily the case,"
7161,RURAL FELICITY.,"Tho’ they don’t laugh out, the mischievous brats, I see the “hooray!” in their face."
7162,RURAL FELICITY.,"There’s the other day, for my sight is short, and I saw what was green beyond,"
7163,RURAL FELICITY.,"And thought it was all terry firmer and grass, till I walked in the duckweed pond:"
7164,RURAL FELICITY.,"Or perhaps when I’ve pully-hauled up a bank they see me come launching down,"
7165,RURAL FELICITY.,As none but a stout London female can do as is come a first time out of town.
7166,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then how sweet, some say, on a mossy bank a verdurous seat to find,"
7167,RURAL FELICITY.,But for my part I always found it a joy that brought a repentance behind;
7168,RURAL FELICITY.,For the juicy grass with its nasty green has stained a whole breadth of my gown--
7169,RURAL FELICITY.,"And when gowns are dyed, I needn’t say, it’s much better done up in town."
7170,RURAL FELICITY.,"As for country fare, the first morning I came I heard such a shrill piece of work!"
7171,RURAL FELICITY.,And ever since--and it’s ten days ago--we’ve lived upon nothing but pork;
7172,RURAL FELICITY.,"One Sunday except, and then I turn’d sick, a plague take all countrified cooks!"
7173,RURAL FELICITY.,"Why didn’t they tell me, _before_ I had dined, they made pigeon pies of the rooks?"
7174,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then the gooseberry wine, tho’ it’s pleasant when up, it doesn’t agree when it"
7175,RURAL FELICITY.,"’s down,"
7176,RURAL FELICITY.,"But it served me right, like a gooseberry, fool to look for champagne out of town?"
7177,RURAL FELICITY.,"To be sure cousin G. meant it all for the best when he started this pastoral plan,"
7178,RURAL FELICITY.,"And his wife is a worthy domestical soul and she teaches me all that she can,"
7179,RURAL FELICITY.,"Such as making of cheese, and curing of hams, but I’m sure that I never shall learn,"
7180,RURAL FELICITY.,And I’ve fetch’d more back-ache than butter as yet by chumping away at the churn;
7181,RURAL FELICITY.,"But in making hay, tho’ it’s tanning work, I found it more easy to make,"
7182,RURAL FELICITY.,"But it tries one’s legs, and no great relief when you’re tired to sit down on the rake."
7183,RURAL FELICITY.,"I’d a country dance, too, at harvest home, with a regular country clown,"
7184,RURAL FELICITY.,"But, Lord! they don’t hug one round the waist and give one such smacks in town:"
7185,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then I’ve tried to make friends with the birds and the beasts, but they take to such curious rigs,"
7186,RURAL FELICITY.,"I’m always at odds with the turkey-cock, and I can’t even please the pigs."
7187,RURAL FELICITY.,"The very hens pick holes in my hand when I grope for the new-laid eggs,"
7188,RURAL FELICITY.,And the gander comes hissing out of the pond on purpose to flap at my legs.
7189,RURAL FELICITY.,"I’ve been bump’d in a ditch by the cow without horns, and the old sow trampled me down,"
7190,RURAL FELICITY.,The beasts are as vicious as any wild beasts--but they’re kept in cages in town!
7191,RURAL FELICITY.,Another thing is the nasty dogs--thro’ the village I hardly can stir
7192,RURAL FELICITY.,Since giving a bumpkin a pint of beer just to call off a barking cur;
7193,RURAL FELICITY.,"And now you would swear all the dogs in the place were set on to hunt me down,"
7194,RURAL FELICITY.,But neither the brutes nor the people I think are as civilly bred as in town.
7195,RURAL FELICITY.,"Last night about twelve I was scared broad awake, and all in a tremble of fright,"
7196,RURAL FELICITY.,"But instead of a family murder it proved an owl, that flies screeching at night."
7197,RURAL FELICITY.,"Then there’s plenty of ricks and stalks all about, and I can’t help dreaming of Swing--"
7198,RURAL FELICITY.,"In short, I think that a pastoral life is not the most happiest thing;"
7199,RURAL FELICITY.,"For, besides all the troubles I’ve mentioned before, as endured for rurality’s sake,"
7200,RURAL FELICITY.,"I’ve been stung by the bees, and I’ve set among ants, and once--ugh! I trod on"
7201,RURAL FELICITY.,a snake!
7202,RURAL FELICITY.,"And as to mosquitoes, they tortured me so, for I’ve got a particular skin,"
7203,RURAL FELICITY.,"I do think it’s the gnats coming out of the ponds, that drives the poor suicides in!"
7204,RURAL FELICITY.,And after all an’t there new-laid eggs to be had upon Holborn Hill?
7205,RURAL FELICITY.,"And dairy-fed pork in Broad St. Giles, and fresh butter wherever you will?"
7206,RURAL FELICITY.,And a covered cart that brings Cottage Bread quite rustical-like and brown?
7207,RURAL FELICITY.,So one isn’t so very uncountrified in the very heart of the town.
7208,RURAL FELICITY.,"Howsomever my mind’s made up, and although I’m sure cousin Giles will be vext,"
7209,RURAL FELICITY.,"I mean to book me an inside place up to town upon Saturday next,"
7210,RURAL FELICITY.,"And if nothing happens, soon after ten, I shall be at the Old Bell and Crown,"
7211,RURAL FELICITY.,"And perhaps I may come to the country again, when London is all burnt down."

7464,A BLACK JOB.,"Not merely male, but female duns,"
7465,A BLACK JOB.,"Young, old, and middle-aged--of all degrees--"
7466,A BLACK JOB.,"With many of those persevering ones,"
7467,A BLACK JOB.,Who mite by mite would beg a cheese!
7468,A BLACK JOB.,
7469,A BLACK JOB.,And what might be their aim?
7470,A BLACK JOB.,To rescue Afric’s sable sons from fetters--
7471,A BLACK JOB.,To save their bodies from the burning shame
7472,A BLACK JOB.,Of branding with hot letters--
7473,A BLACK JOB.,"Their shoulders from the cowhide’s bloody strokes,"
7474,A BLACK JOB.,Their necks from iron yokes?
7475,A BLACK JOB.,"To end or mitigate the ills of slavery,"
7476,A BLACK JOB.,"The Planter’s avarice, the Driver’s knavery?"
7477,A BLACK JOB.,"To school the heathen Negroes and enlighten ’em,"
7478,A BLACK JOB.,"To polish up and brighten ’em,"
7479,A BLACK JOB.,And make them worthy of eternal bliss?
7480,A BLACK JOB.,"Why, no--the simple end and aim was this--"
7481,A BLACK JOB.,Reading a well-known proverb much amiss--
7482,A BLACK JOB.,To wash and whiten ’em!
7483,A BLACK JOB.,
7484,A BLACK JOB.,They look’d so ugly in their sable hides:
7485,A BLACK JOB.,"So dark, so dingy, like a grubby lot"
7486,A BLACK JOB.,"Of sooty sweeps, or colliers, and besides,"
7487,A BLACK JOB.,However the poor elves
7488,A BLACK JOB.,"Might wash themselves,"
7489,A BLACK JOB.,Nobody knew if they were clean or not--
7490,A BLACK JOB.,On Nature’s fairness they were quite a blot!
7491,A BLACK JOB.,Not to forget more serious complaints
7492,A BLACK JOB.,"That even while they join’d in pious hymn,"
7493,A BLACK JOB.,"So black they were and grim,"
7494,A BLACK JOB.,"In face and limb,"
7495,A BLACK JOB.,"They look’d like Devils, though they sang like Saints!"
7496,A BLACK JOB.,
7497,A BLACK JOB.,The thing was undeniable!
7498,A BLACK JOB.,They wanted washing! not that slight ablution
7499,A BLACK JOB.,"To which the skin of the White Man is liable,"
7500,A BLACK JOB.,Merely removing transient pollution--
7501,A BLACK JOB.,"But good, hard, honest, energetic rubbing"
7502,A BLACK JOB.,"And scrubbing,"
7503,A BLACK JOB.,Sousing each sooty frame from heels to head
7504,A BLACK JOB.,"With stiff, strong, saponaceous lather,"
7505,A BLACK JOB.,"And pails of water--hottish rather,"
7506,A BLACK JOB.,But not so boiling as to turn ’em red!
7507,A BLACK JOB.,
7508,A BLACK JOB.,So spoke the philanthropic man
7509,A BLACK JOB.,"Who laid, and hatch’d, and nursed the plan--"
7510,A BLACK JOB.,And oh! to view its glorious consummation!
7511,A BLACK JOB.,"The brooms and mops,"
7512,A BLACK JOB.,"The tubs and slops,"
7513,A BLACK JOB.,The baths and brushes in full operation!
7514,A BLACK JOB.,"To see each Crow, or Jim, or John,"
7515,A BLACK JOB.,Go in a raven and come out a swan!
7516,A BLACK JOB.,"While fair as Cavendishes, Vanes, and Russels,"
7517,A BLACK JOB.,"Black Venus rises from the soapy surge,"
7518,A BLACK JOB.,And all the little Niggerlings emerge
7519,A BLACK JOB.,As lily-white as mussels.
7520,A BLACK JOB.,
7521,A BLACK JOB.,Sweet was the vision--but alas!
7522,A BLACK JOB.,"However in prospectus bright and sunny,"
7523,A BLACK JOB.,To bring such visionary scenes to pass
7524,A BLACK JOB.,"One thing was requisite, and that was--money;"
7525,A BLACK JOB.,"Money, that pays the laundress and her bills,"
7526,A BLACK JOB.,"For socks and collars, shirts and frills,"
7527,A BLACK JOB.,"Cravats and kerchiefs--money, without which"
7528,A BLACK JOB.,The negroes must remain as dark as pitch;
7529,A BLACK JOB.,"A thing to make all Christians sad and shivery,"
7530,A BLACK JOB.,To think of millions of immortal souls
7531,A BLACK JOB.,"Dwelling in bodies black as coals,"
7532,A BLACK JOB.,And living--so to speak--in Satan’s livery!
7533,A BLACK JOB.,
7534,A BLACK JOB.,"Money--the root of evil,--dross, and stuff!"
7535,A BLACK JOB.,"But oh! how happy ought the rich to feel,"
7536,A BLACK JOB.,Whose means enable them to give enough
7537,A BLACK JOB.,To blanch an African from head to heel!
7538,A BLACK JOB.,"How blessed--yea, thrice blessed--to subscribe"
7539,A BLACK JOB.,Enough to scour a tribe!
7540,A BLACK JOB.,"While he whose fortune was at best a brittle one,"
7541,A BLACK JOB.,"Although he gave but pence, how sweet to know"
7542,A BLACK JOB.,"He helped to bleach a Hottentot’s great toe,"
7543,A BLACK JOB.,Or little one!
7544,A BLACK JOB.,Moved by this logic (or appall’d)
7545,A BLACK JOB.,"To persons of a certain turn so proper,"
7546,A BLACK JOB.,"The money came when call’d,"
7547,A BLACK JOB.,"In silver, gold, and copper,"
7548,A BLACK JOB.,"Presents from “Friends to blacks,” or foes to whites,"
7549,A BLACK JOB.,"“Trifles,” and “offerings,” and “widow’s mites,”"
7550,A BLACK JOB.,"Plump legacies, and yearly benefactions,"
7551,A BLACK JOB.,With other gifts
7552,A BLACK JOB.,"And charitable lifts,"

7568,A BLACK JOB.,
7569,A BLACK JOB.,Great were the sums collected!
7570,A BLACK JOB.,And great results in consequence expected.
7571,A BLACK JOB.,"But somehow, in the teeth of all endeavour,"
7572,A BLACK JOB.,According to reports
7573,A BLACK JOB.,"At yearly courts,"
7574,A BLACK JOB.,"The blacks, confound them! were as black as ever!"
7575,A BLACK JOB.,
7576,A BLACK JOB.,"Yes! spite of all the water sous’d aloft,"
7577,A BLACK JOB.,"Soap, plain and mottled, hard and soft,"
7578,A BLACK JOB.,"Soda and pearlash, huckaback and sand,"
7579,A BLACK JOB.,"Brooms, brushes, palm of hand,"

7583,A BLACK JOB.,"The blacks, confound them! were as black as ever!"
7584,A BLACK JOB.,
7585,A BLACK JOB.,"In fact in his perennial speech,"
7586,A BLACK JOB.,"The Chairman own’d the niggers did not bleach,"
7587,A BLACK JOB.,"As he had hoped,"
7588,A BLACK JOB.,"From being washed and soaped,"
7589,A BLACK JOB.,A circumstance he named with grief and pity;
7590,A BLACK JOB.,"But still he had the happiness to say,"
7591,A BLACK JOB.,"For self and the Committee,"
7592,A BLACK JOB.,By persevering in the present way
7593,A BLACK JOB.,"And scrubbing at the Blacks from day to day,"
7594,A BLACK JOB.,"Although he could not promise perfect white,"
7595,A BLACK JOB.,"From certain symptoms that had come to light,"
7596,A BLACK JOB.,He hoped in time to get them gray!
7597,A BLACK JOB.,
7598,A BLACK JOB.,"Lull’d by this vague assurance,"
7599,A BLACK JOB.,The friends and patrons of the sable tribe
7600,A BLACK JOB.,"Continued to subscribe,"
7601,A BLACK JOB.,"And waited, waited on with much endurance--"
7602,A BLACK JOB.,"Many a frugal sister, thrifty daughter--"
7603,A BLACK JOB.,"Many a stinted widow, pinching mother--"
7604,A BLACK JOB.,"With income by the tax made somewhat shorter,"
7605,A BLACK JOB.,"Still paid implicitly her crown per quarter,"
7606,A BLACK JOB.,"Only to hear as ev’ry year came round,"
7607,A BLACK JOB.,That Mr. Treasurer had spent her pound;
7608,A BLACK JOB.,"And as she loved her sable brother,"
7609,A BLACK JOB.,That Mr. Treasurer must have another!
7610,A BLACK JOB.,
7611,A BLACK JOB.,"But, spite of pounds or guineas,"
7612,A BLACK JOB.,Instead of giving any hint
7613,A BLACK JOB.,"Of turning to a neutral tint,"
7614,A BLACK JOB.,The plaguy negroes and their piccaninnies
7615,A BLACK JOB.,Were still the colour of the bird that caws--
7616,A BLACK JOB.,Only some very aged souls
7617,A BLACK JOB.,"Showing a little gray upon their polls,"
7618,A BLACK JOB.,Like daws!
7619,A BLACK JOB.,
7620,A BLACK JOB.,"However, nothing dashed"
7621,A BLACK JOB.,"By such repeated failures, or abashed,"
7622,A BLACK JOB.,"The Court still met;--the Chairman and Directors,"
7623,A BLACK JOB.,"The Secretary, good at pen and ink,"
7624,A BLACK JOB.,"The worthy Treasurer, who kept the chink,"
7625,A BLACK JOB.,And all the cash Collectors;
7626,A BLACK JOB.,"With hundreds of that class, so kindly credulous,"
7627,A BLACK JOB.,"Without whose help, no charlatan alive,"
7628,A BLACK JOB.,"Or Bubble Company could hope to thrive,"
7629,A BLACK JOB.,"Or busy Chevalier, however sedulous--"
7630,A BLACK JOB.,"Those good and easy innocents in fact,"
7631,A BLACK JOB.,"Who willingly receiving chaff for corn,"
7632,A BLACK JOB.,"As pointed out by Butler’s tact,"
7633,A BLACK JOB.,Still find a secret pleasure in the act
7634,A BLACK JOB.,Of being pluck’d and shorn!
7635,A BLACK JOB.,
7636,A BLACK JOB.,"However, in long hundreds there they were,"
7637,A BLACK JOB.,"Thronging the hot, and close, and dusty court,"
7638,A BLACK JOB.,"To hear once more addresses from the Chair,"
7639,A BLACK JOB.,And regular Report.
7640,A BLACK JOB.,
7641,A BLACK JOB.,"Alas! concluding in the usual strain,"
7642,A BLACK JOB.,"That what with everlasting wear and tear,"
7643,A BLACK JOB.,The scrubbing-brushes hadn’t got a hair--
7644,A BLACK JOB.,The brooms--mere stumps--would never serve again--
7645,A BLACK JOB.,"The soap was gone, the flannels all in shreds,"
7646,A BLACK JOB.,"The towels worn to threads,"
7647,A BLACK JOB.,The tubs and pails too shatter’d to be mended--
7648,A BLACK JOB.,"And what was added with a deal of pain,"
7649,A BLACK JOB.,"But as accounts correctly would explain,"
7650,A BLACK JOB.,Tho’ thirty thousand pounds had been expended--
7651,A BLACK JOB.,The Blackamoors had still been wash’d in vain!
7652,A BLACK JOB.,
7653,A BLACK JOB.,"“In fact, the negroes were as black as ink,"
7654,A BLACK JOB.,"Yet, still as the Committee dared to think,"
7655,A BLACK JOB.,"And hoped the proposition was not rash,"

7657,A BLACK JOB.,But ere the prospect could be made more sunny--
7658,A BLACK JOB.,"Up jump’d a little, lemon-coloured man,"
7659,A BLACK JOB.,"And with an eager stammer, thus began,"
7660,A BLACK JOB.,"In angry earnest, though it sounded funny:"
7661,A BLACK JOB.,"“What! More subscriptions! No--no--no,--not I!"
7662,A BLACK JOB.,You have had time--time--time enough to try!
7663,A BLACK JOB.,They WON’T come white! then why--why--why--why--why
7664,A BLACK JOB.,More money?”
7665,A BLACK JOB.,
7666,A BLACK JOB.,"“Why!” said the Chairman, with an accent bland,"
7667,A BLACK JOB.,"And gentle waving of his dexter hand,"
7668,A BLACK JOB.,"“Why must we have more dross, and dirt, and dust,"
7669,A BLACK JOB.,"More filthy lucre, in a word, more gold--"
7670,A BLACK JOB.,"The why, sir, very easily is told,"
7671,A BLACK JOB.,Because Humanity declares we must!
7672,A BLACK JOB.,"We’ve scrubb’d the negroes till we’ve nearly killed ’em,"
7673,A BLACK JOB.,"And finding that we cannot wash them white,"
7674,A BLACK JOB.,"But still their nigritude offends the sight,"

10760,A COMIC BALLAD.,"Except in one regard,"
10761,A COMIC BALLAD.,"He did not like _soft_ water,"
10762,A COMIC BALLAD.,So he took to _drinking hard_!
10763,A COMIC BALLAD.,
10764,A COMIC BALLAD.,"Said he, “Let others fancy slops,"
10765,A COMIC BALLAD.,"And talk in praise of Tea,"
10766,A COMIC BALLAD.,"But I am no _Bohe_mian,"
10767,A COMIC BALLAD.,So do not like _Bohea_.

10770,A COMIC BALLAD.,What matter whether one is kill’d
10771,A COMIC BALLAD.,By _canister_ or _grape_!”
10772,A COMIC BALLAD.,
10773,A COMIC BALLAD.,According to this kind of taste
10774,A COMIC BALLAD.,"Did he indulge his drouth,"
10775,A COMIC BALLAD.,"And being fond of _Port_, he made"
10776,A COMIC BALLAD.,A _port_-hole of his mouth!
10777,A COMIC BALLAD.,A single pint he might have sipp’d
10778,A COMIC BALLAD.,"And not been out of sorts,"
10779,A COMIC BALLAD.,In geologic phrase--the rock
10780,A COMIC BALLAD.,He split upon was _quarts_!
10781,A COMIC BALLAD.,
10782,A COMIC BALLAD.,To “hold the mirror up to vice”
10783,A COMIC BALLAD.,"With him was hard, alas!"
10784,A COMIC BALLAD.,"The worse for wine he often was,"
10785,A COMIC BALLAD.,But not “before a glass.”
10786,A COMIC BALLAD.,No kind and prudent friend had he
10787,A COMIC BALLAD.,"To bid him drink no more,--"
10788,A COMIC BALLAD.,The only _chequers_ in his course
10789,A COMIC BALLAD.,Were at a tavern door!
10790,A COMIC BALLAD.,
10791,A COMIC BALLAD.,Full soon the sad effects of this
10792,A COMIC BALLAD.,"His frame began to show,"
10793,A COMIC BALLAD.,For that old enemy the gout
10794,A COMIC BALLAD.,Had taken him in _toe_!
10795,A COMIC BALLAD.,And join’d with this an evil came
10796,A COMIC BALLAD.,"Of quite another sort,--"
10797,A COMIC BALLAD.,"For while he drank, himself, his purse"
10798,A COMIC BALLAD.,Was getting “_something short_.”
10799,A COMIC BALLAD.,
10800,A COMIC BALLAD.,For want of cash he soon had pawn’d
10801,A COMIC BALLAD.,"One half that he possess’d,"
10802,A COMIC BALLAD.,And drinking show’d him _duplicates_
10803,A COMIC BALLAD.,Beforehand of the rest!
10804,A COMIC BALLAD.,So now his creditors resolved
10805,A COMIC BALLAD.,To seize on his assets;
10806,A COMIC BALLAD.,"For why,--they found that his _half-pay_"
10807,A COMIC BALLAD.,Did not _half-pay_ his debts.
10808,A COMIC BALLAD.,
10809,A COMIC BALLAD.,But Luff contrived a novel mode
10810,A COMIC BALLAD.,His Creditors to chouse;
10811,A COMIC BALLAD.,For his own _execution_ he
10812,A COMIC BALLAD.,Put into his own house!
10813,A COMIC BALLAD.,A pistol to the muzzle charged
10814,A COMIC BALLAD.,He took devoid of fear;
10815,A COMIC BALLAD.,"Said he, “This _barrel_ is my last,"
10816,A COMIC BALLAD.,So now for my last _bier_!”
10817,A COMIC BALLAD.,
10818,A COMIC BALLAD.,"Against his lungs he aimed the slugs,"
10819,A COMIC BALLAD.,"And not against his brain,"
10820,A COMIC BALLAD.,So he blew out his _lights_--and none
10821,A COMIC BALLAD.,Could blow them in again!
10822,A COMIC BALLAD.,A Jury for a Verdict met
10823,A COMIC BALLAD.,And gave it in these terms:--
10824,A COMIC BALLAD.,“We find as how as certain _slugs_

11666,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Made one great march of mind.
11667,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11668,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Gentle and simple, he and she,"

11682,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11683,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"All sorts of vehicles and vans,"
11684,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Bad, middling, and the smart;"
11685,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Here rolled along the gay barouche,"
11686,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And there a dirty cart!
11687,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11688,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And lo! a cart that held a squad
11689,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Of costermonger line;
11690,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"With one poor hack, like Pegasus,"
11691,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,That slaved for all the Nine!
11692,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11693,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Yet marvel not at any load
11694,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,That any horse might drag;
11695,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"When all, that morn, at once were drawn"
11696,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Together by a stag.
11697,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11698,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Now when they saw John Huggins go
11699,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,At such a sober pace;
11700,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"“Hallo!” cried they; “come trot away,"
11701,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,You’ll never see the chase!”
11702,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11703,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"But John, as grave as any judge,"
11704,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Made answer quite as blunt;
11705,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"“It will be time enough to trot,"
11706,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,When I begin to hunt!”
11707,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11708,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And so he paced to Woodford Wells,"
11709,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Where many a horseman met,"
11710,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And letting go the _reins_ of course,"
11711,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Prepared for _heavy wet_.
11712,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11713,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And lo! within the crowded door,"
11714,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Stood Rounding, jovial elf;"
11715,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Here shall the Muse frame no excuse,"
11716,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,But frame the man himself.
11717,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11718,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A snow-white head, a merry eye,"
11719,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A cheek of jolly blush;
11720,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A claret tint laid on by health,"
11721,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,With master Reynard’s brush;
11722,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11723,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A hearty frame, a courteous bow,"
11724,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The prince he learned it from;
11725,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"His age about threescore and ten,"
11726,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And there you have Old Tom.
11727,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11728,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"In merriest key I trow was he,"
11729,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,So many guests to boast;
11730,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"So certain congregations meet,"
11731,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And elevate the host.
11732,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11733,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"“Now welcome lads,” quoth he, “and prads,"
11734,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,You’re all in glorious luck:
11735,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Old Robin has a run to-day,"
11736,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A noted forest buck.
11737,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11738,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"“Fair Mead’s the place, where Bob and Tom,"
11739,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,In red already ride;
11740,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"’Tis but a _step_, and on a horse,"
11741,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,You soon may go _a-stride_.”
11742,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11743,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"So off they scampered, man and horse,"
11744,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As time and temper pressed--
11745,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"But Huggins, hitching on a tree,"
11746,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,_Branched_ off from all the rest.
11747,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11748,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Howbeit he tumbled down in time
11749,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"To join with Tom and Bob,"
11750,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"All in Fair Mead, which held that day"
11751,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Its own fair meed of mob.
11752,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11753,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Idlers to wit--no Guardians some,"
11754,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Of Tattlers in a squeeze;
11755,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Ramblers in heavy carts and vans,"
11756,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Spectators up in trees.
11757,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11758,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Butchers on backs of butchers’ hacks,"
11759,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,That _shambled_ to and fro!
11760,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Bakers intent upon a buck,"
11761,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Neglectful of the _dough!_
11762,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11763,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Change Alley Bears to speculate,"
11764,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As usual for a fall;
11765,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And green and scarlet runners, such"
11766,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As never climbed a wall!
11767,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11768,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,’Twas strange to think what difference
11769,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A single creature made;
11770,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A single stag had caused a whole
11771,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,_Stag_nation in their trade.
11772,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11773,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Now Huggins from his saddle rose,"
11774,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And in the stirrups stood;
11775,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And lo! a little cart that came
11776,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Hard by a little wood.
11777,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11778,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,In shape like half a hearse--though not
11779,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,For corpses in the least;
11780,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For this contained the _deer alive_,"
11781,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And not the _dear deceased_!
11782,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11783,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And now began a sudden stir,"
11784,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And then a sudden shout,"
11785,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The prison doors were opened wide,"
11786,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And Robin bounded out!
11787,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11788,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"His antlered head shone blue and red,"
11789,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Bedecked with ribbons fine;
11790,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Like other bucks that come to ‘list
11791,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The hawbucks in the line.
11792,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11793,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"One curious gaze of wild amaze,"
11794,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,He turned and shortly took:
11795,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Then gently ran adown the mead,"
11796,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And bounded o’er the brook.
11797,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11798,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Now Huggins, standing far aloof,"
11799,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Had never seen the deer,"
11800,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Till all at once he saw the beast
11801,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Come charging in his rear.
11802,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11803,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Away he went, and many a score"
11804,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Of riders did the same,"
11805,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,On horse and ass--like High and Low
11806,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And Jack pursuing game!
11807,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11808,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Good Lord! to see the riders now,"
11809,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Thrown off with sudden whirl,"
11810,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A score within the purling brook,"
11811,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Enjoyed their “early purl.”
11812,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11813,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A score were sprawling on the grass,"
11814,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And beavers fell in showers;
11815,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"There was another _Floorer_ there,"
11816,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Beside the Queen of Flowers!
11817,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11818,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Some lost their stirrups, some their whips,"
11819,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Some had no caps to show:
11820,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"But few, like Charles at Charing Cross"
11821,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Rode on in _Statue_ quo.
11822,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11823,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"“O dear! O dear!” now might you hear,"
11824,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,“I’ve surely broke a bone;”
11825,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,“My head is sore”--with many more
11826,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Such Speeches from the _Thrown_.
11827,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11828,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Howbeit their wailings never moved
11829,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The wide Satanic clan,"
11830,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Who grinned, as once the Devil grinned,"
11831,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To see the fall of Man.
11832,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11833,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And hunters good that understood,"
11834,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Their laughter knew no bounds,"
11835,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To see the horses “throwing off”
11836,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,So long before the hounds.
11837,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11838,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For deer must have due course of law,"
11839,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Like men the Courts among;
11840,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Before those Barristers the dogs
11841,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Proceed to “giving tongue.”
11842,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11843,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,But now Old Robin’s foes were set
11844,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"That fatal taint to find,"
11845,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"That always is scent after him,"
11846,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Yet always left behind.
11847,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11848,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And here observe how dog and man
11849,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A different temper shows:
11850,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,What hound resents that he is sent
11851,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To follow his own nose?
11852,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11853,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Towler and Jowler--howlers all,"
11854,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,No single tongue was mute;
11855,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The stag had led a hart, and lo!"
11856,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The whole pack followed suit.
11857,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11858,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,No spur he lacked; fear stuck a knife
11859,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And fork in either haunch;
11860,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And every dog he knew had got
11861,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,An eye-tooth to his paunch!
11862,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11863,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Away, away! he scudded like"
11864,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A ship before the gale;
11865,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Now flew to _h_ills we know not of,"
11866,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Now, nun-like, took the vale."
11867,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11868,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Another squadron charging now,"
11869,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Went off at furious pitch;--
11870,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A perfect Tam O’Shanter mob,"
11871,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Without a single witch.
11872,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11873,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"But who was he with flying skirts,"
11874,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A hunter did endorse,"
11875,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And, like a poet, seemed to ride"
11876,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Upon a wingèd horse?
11877,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11878,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A whipper-in? no whipper-in:
11879,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A huntsman? no such soul:
11880,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A connoisseur, or amateur?"
11881,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Why, yes--a horse patrol."
11882,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11883,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A member of police, for whom"
11884,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The county found a nag,"
11885,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And, like Actæon in the tale,"
11886,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,He found himself in stag!
11887,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11888,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Away they went, then, dog and deer,"
11889,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And hunters all away;
11890,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The maddest horses never knew
11891,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,_Mad staggers_ such as they!
11892,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11893,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Some gave a shout, some rolled about,"
11894,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And anticked as they rode;
11895,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And butchers whistled on their curs,"
11896,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And milkmen _Tally-ho’d_!
11897,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11898,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"About two score there were, or more,"
11899,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,That galloped in the race;
11900,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The rest, alas! lay on the grass,"
11901,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As once in Chevy Chase!
11902,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11903,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,But even those that galloped on
11904,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Were fewer every minute;
11905,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The field kept getting more select,"
11906,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Each thicket served to thin it.
11907,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11908,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For some pulled up, and left the hunt,"
11909,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Some fell in miry bogs,"
11910,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And vainly rose and “ran a muck,”"
11911,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To overtake the dogs.
11912,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11913,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And some, in charging hurdle stakes,"
11914,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Were left bereft of sense;
11915,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,What else could be premised of blades
11916,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,That never learned to fence?
11917,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11918,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"But Roundings, Tom and Bob, no gate,"
11919,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Nor hedge, nor ditch could stay;"
11920,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"O’er all they went, and did the work"
11921,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Of leap-years in a day!
11922,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11923,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And by their side see Huggins ride,"
11924,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As fast as he could speed;
11925,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For, like Mazeppa, he was quite"
11926,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,At mercy of his steed.
11927,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11928,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"No means he had, by timely check,"
11929,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The gallop to remit,"
11930,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For firm and fast, between his teeth,"
11931,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The biter held the bit.
11932,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11933,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Trees raced along, all Essex fled"
11934,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Beneath him as he sate;
11935,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,He never saw a county go
11936,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,At such a county rate!
11937,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11938,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,“Hold hard! hold hard! you’ll lame the dogs!”
11939,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Quoth Huggins, “so I do;"
11940,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"I’ve got the saddle well in hand,"
11941,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And hold as hard as you!”
11942,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11943,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Good Lord! to see him ride along,"
11944,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And throw his arms about,"
11945,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As if with stitches in the side
11946,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,That he was drawing out!
11947,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11948,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And now he bounded up and down,"
11949,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Now like a jelly shook;
11950,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Till bumped and galled--yet not where Gall
11951,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,For bumps did ever look!
11952,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11953,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And rowing with his legs the while,"
11954,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As tars are apt to ride;
11955,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,With every kick he gave a prick
11956,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Deep in the horse’s side!
11957,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11958,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,But soon the horse was well avenged
11959,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For cruel smart of spurs,"
11960,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For, riding through a moor, he pitched"
11961,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,His master in a furze!
11962,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11963,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Where, sharper set than hunger is,"
11964,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,He squatted all forlorn;
11965,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And, like a bird, was singing out"
11966,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,While sitting on a thorn!
11967,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11968,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Right glad was he, as well might be,"
11969,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Such cushion to resign;
11970,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"“Possession is nine points,” but his"
11971,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Seems more than ninety-nine.
11972,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11973,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Yet worse than all the prickly points
11974,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"That entered in his skin,"
11975,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,His nag was running off the while
11976,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The thorns were running in!
11977,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11978,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Now had a Papist seen his sport,"
11979,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Thus laid upon the shelf,"
11980,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Although no horse he had to cross,"
11981,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,He might have crossed himself.
11982,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11983,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Yet surely still the wind is ill
11984,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,That none can say is fair;
11985,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A jolly wight there was, that rode"
11986,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Upon a sorry mare!
11987,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11988,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A sorry mare, that surely came"
11989,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Of pagan blood and bone;
11990,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,For down upon her knees she went
11991,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To many a stock and stone!
11992,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11993,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Now seeing Huggins’ nag adrift,"
11994,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"This farmer, shrewd and sage,"
11995,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Resolved, by changing horses here,"
11996,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To hunt another stage!
11997,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
11998,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Though felony, yet who would let"
11999,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Another’s horse alone,"
12000,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Whose neck is placed in jeopardy
12001,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,By riding on his own?
12002,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12003,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And yet the conduct of the man
12004,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Seemed honest-like and fair;
12005,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For he seemed willing, horse and all,"
12006,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To go before the _mare_!
12007,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12008,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"So up on Huggins’ horse he got,"
12009,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And swiftly rode away,"
12010,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,While Huggins mounted on the mare
12011,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Done brown upon a bay!
12012,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12013,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And off they set in double chase,"
12014,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For such was fortune’s whim,"
12015,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The farmer rode to hunt the stag,"
12016,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And Huggins hunted him!
12017,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12018,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Alas! with one that rode so well
12019,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,In vain it was to strive;
12020,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"A dab was he, as dabs should be--"
12021,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,All leaping and alive.
12022,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12023,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And here of Nature’s kindly care
12024,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Behold a curious proof,"
12025,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"As nags are meant to leap, she puts"
12026,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A frog in every hoof!
12027,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12028,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Whereas the mare, although her share"
12029,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"She had of hoof and frog,"
12030,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,On coming to a gate stopped short
12031,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As stiff as any log;
12032,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12033,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,While Huggins in the stirrup stood
12034,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"With neck like neck of crane,"
12035,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As sings the Scottish song--“to see
12036,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The _gate_ his _hart_ had gane.”
12037,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12038,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And, lo! the dim and distant hunt"
12039,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Diminished in a trice:
12040,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The steeds, like Cinderella’s team,"
12041,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Seemed dwindling into mice;
12042,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12043,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And, far remote, each scarlet coat"
12044,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Soon flitted like a spark--
12045,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Though still the forest murmured back
12046,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,An echo of the bark!
12047,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12048,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,But sad at soul John Huggins turned:
12049,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,No comfort could he find;
12050,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"While thus the “Hunting Chorus” sped,"
12051,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To stay five bars behind.
12052,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12053,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,For though by dint of spur he got
12054,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A leap in spite of fate--
12055,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Howbeit there was no toll at all--
12056,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,They could not clear the gate.
12057,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12058,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And, like Fitzjames, he cursed the hunt,"
12059,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And sorely cursed the day,"
12060,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And mused a New Gray’s elegy
12061,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,On his departed gray.
12062,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12063,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Now many a sign at Woodford town
12064,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Its Inn-vitation tells:
12065,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"But Huggins, full of ills, of course"
12066,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Betook him to the Wells,"
12067,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12068,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Where Rounding tried to cheer him up
12069,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,With many a merry laugh:
12070,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"But Huggins thought of neighbour Fig,"
12071,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And called for half-and-half.
12072,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12073,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Yet, spite of drink, he could not blink"
12074,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Remembrance of his loss;
12075,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"To drown a care like his, required"
12076,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Enough to drown a horse.
12077,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12078,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"When thus forlorn, a merry horn"
12079,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Struck up without the door--
12080,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The mounted mob were all returned;
12081,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The Epping Hunt was o’er!
12082,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12083,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And many a horse was taken out
12084,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Of saddle, and of shaft;"
12085,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And men, by dint of drink, became"
12086,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The only “_beasts of draught_.”
12087,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12088,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,For now begun a harder run
12089,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"On wine, and gin, and beer;"
12090,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And overtaken men discussed
12091,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The overtaken deer.
12092,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12093,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"How far he ran, and eke how fast,"
12094,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And how at bay he stood,"
12095,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Deerlike, resolved to sell his life"
12096,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,As dearly as he could:--
12097,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12098,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And how the hunters stood aloof,"
12099,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Regardful of their lives,"
12100,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And shunned a beast, whose very horns"
12101,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,They knew could _handle_ knives!
12102,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12103,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,How Huggins stood when he was rubbed
12104,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"By help and ostler kind,"
12105,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And when they cleaned the clay before,"
12106,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,How worse “remained behind.”
12107,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12108,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And one, how he had found a horse"
12109,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Adrift--a goodly gray!
12110,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"And kindly rode the nag, for fear"
12111,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,The nag should go astray;
12112,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12113,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Now Huggins, when he heard the tale,"
12114,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Jumped up with sudden glee;
12115,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12116,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,[Illustration: THE JUDGMENT OF SOLOMON.]

12119,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12120,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"“A goodly gray! why, then, I say,"
12121,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,That gray belongs to me!
12122,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12123,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"“Let me endorse again my horse,"
12124,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,Delivered safe and sound;
12125,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And gladly I will give the man
12126,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,A bottle and a pound!”
12127,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12128,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"The wine was drunk--the money paid,"
12129,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"Though not without remorse,"
12130,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To pay another man so much
12131,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,For riding on his horse;--
12132,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,
12133,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,And let the chase again take place
12134,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,"For many a long, long year--"
12135,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,John Huggins will not ride again
12136,“HUNT’S ROASTED----”,To hunt the Epping Deer!

12183,JACK HALL.,‘Neath church-yard wall--
12184,JACK HALL.,"Mayhap because he fed on graves,"
12185,JACK HALL.,Was named Jack Hall.
12186,JACK HALL.,
12187,JACK HALL.,By day it was his trade to go
12188,JACK HALL.,Tending the black coach to and fro;
12189,JACK HALL.,"And sometimes at the door of woe,"
12190,JACK HALL.,"With emblems suitable,"
12191,JACK HALL.,"He stood with brother Mute, to show"
12192,JACK HALL.,That life is mutable.
12193,JACK HALL.,
12194,JACK HALL.,"But long before they pass’d the ferry,"
12195,JACK HALL.,"The dead that he had help’d to bury,"
12196,JACK HALL.,He sack’d--(he had a sack to carry
12197,JACK HALL.,The bodies off in)
12198,JACK HALL.,"In fact, he let them have a very"
12199,JACK HALL.,Short fit of coffin.
12200,JACK HALL.,
12201,JACK HALL.,"Night after night, with crow and spade,"
12202,JACK HALL.,"He drove this dead but thriving trade,"
12203,JACK HALL.,Meanwhile his conscience never weigh’d
12204,JACK HALL.,A single horsehair;
12205,JACK HALL.,"On corses of all kinds he prey’d,"
12206,JACK HALL.,A perfect corsair!
12207,JACK HALL.,
12208,JACK HALL.,"At last--it may be, Death took spite,"
12209,JACK HALL.,"Or, jesting only, meant to fright--"
12210,JACK HALL.,He sought for Jack night after night
12211,JACK HALL.,The churchyards round;
12212,JACK HALL.,"And soon they met, the man and sprite,"
12213,JACK HALL.,In Pancras’ ground.
12214,JACK HALL.,
12215,JACK HALL.,"Jack, by the glimpses of the moon,"
12216,JACK HALL.,"Perceiv’d the bony knacker soon,"
12217,JACK HALL.,An awful shape to meet at noon
12218,JACK HALL.,Of night and lonely;
12219,JACK HALL.,But Jack’s tough courage did but swoon
12220,JACK HALL.,A minute only.
12221,JACK HALL.,
12222,JACK HALL.,Anon he gave his spade a swing
12223,JACK HALL.,"Aloft, and kept it brandishing,"
12224,JACK HALL.,Ready for what mishaps might spring
12225,JACK HALL.,From this conjunction;
12226,JACK HALL.,Funking indeed was quite a thing
12227,JACK HALL.,Beside his function.
12228,JACK HALL.,
12229,JACK HALL.,"“Hollo!” cried Death, “d’ye wish your sands"
12230,JACK HALL.,Run out? the stoutest never stands
12231,JACK HALL.,"A chance with me,--to my commands"
12232,JACK HALL.,The strongest truckles;
12233,JACK HALL.,"But I’m your friend--so let’s shake hands,"
12234,JACK HALL.,I should say--knuckles.”
12235,JACK HALL.,
12236,JACK HALL.,"Jack, glad to see th’ old sprite so sprightly"
12237,JACK HALL.,"And meaning nothing but uprightly,"
12238,JACK HALL.,"Shook hands at once, and, bowing slightly,"
12239,JACK HALL.,His mull did proffer:
12240,JACK HALL.,"But Death, who had no nose, politely"
12241,JACK HALL.,Declin’d the offer.
12242,JACK HALL.,
12243,JACK HALL.,"Then sitting down upon a bank,"
12244,JACK HALL.,"Leg over leg, shank over shank,"
12245,JACK HALL.,"Like friends for conversation frank,"
12246,JACK HALL.,That had no check on:
12247,JACK HALL.,"Quoth Jack unto the Lean and Lank,"
12248,JACK HALL.,"“You’re Death, I reckon.”"
12249,JACK HALL.,
12250,JACK HALL.,"The Jaw-bone grinn’d:--“I am that same,"
12251,JACK HALL.,You’ve hit exactly on my name;
12252,JACK HALL.,In truth it has some little fame
12253,JACK HALL.,Where burial sod is.”
12254,JACK HALL.,"Quoth Jack (and wink’d), “of course ye came"
12255,JACK HALL.,Here after bodies.”
12256,JACK HALL.,
12257,JACK HALL.,Death grinn’d again and shook his head:--
12258,JACK HALL.,“I’ve little business with the dead;
12259,JACK HALL.,When they are fairly sent to bed
12260,JACK HALL.,I’ve done my turn:
12261,JACK HALL.,Whether or not the worms are fed
12262,JACK HALL.,Is your concern.
12263,JACK HALL.,
12264,JACK HALL.,"“My errand here, in meeting you,"
12265,JACK HALL.,Is nothing but a ‘how-d’ye-do;’
12266,JACK HALL.,I’ve done what jobs I had--a few
12267,JACK HALL.,Along this way;
12268,JACK HALL.,"If I can serve a crony too,"
12269,JACK HALL.,I beg you’ll say.”
12270,JACK HALL.,
12271,JACK HALL.,"Quoth Jack, “Your Honour’s very kind:"
12272,JACK HALL.,"And now I call the thing to mind,"
12273,JACK HALL.,This parish very strict I find;
12274,JACK HALL.,But in the next ‘un
12275,JACK HALL.,There lives a very well-inclined
12276,JACK HALL.,Old sort of sexton.”
12277,JACK HALL.,
12278,JACK HALL.,"Death took the hint, and gave a wink"
12279,JACK HALL.,As well as eyelet holes can blink;
12280,JACK HALL.,Then stretching out his arm to link
12281,JACK HALL.,"The other’s arm,--"
12282,JACK HALL.,"“Suppose,” says he, “we have a drink"
12283,JACK HALL.,Of something warm.”
12284,JACK HALL.,
12285,JACK HALL.,"Jack nothing loth, with friendly ease"
12286,JACK HALL.,"Spoke up at once:--“Why, what ye please,"
12287,JACK HALL.,"Hard by there is the Cheshire Cheese,"
12288,JACK HALL.,A famous tap.”
12289,JACK HALL.,But this suggestion seem’d to tease
12290,JACK HALL.,The bony chap.
12291,JACK HALL.,
12292,JACK HALL.,"“No, no--your mortal drinks are heady,"
12293,JACK HALL.,And only make my hand unsteady;
12294,JACK HALL.,"I do not even care for Deady,"
12295,JACK HALL.,And loathe your rum;
12296,JACK HALL.,"But I’ve some glorious brewage ready,"
12297,JACK HALL.,My drink is--Mum!”
12298,JACK HALL.,
12299,JACK HALL.,"And off they set, each right content--"
12300,JACK HALL.,Who knows the dreary way they went?
12301,JACK HALL.,"But Jack felt rather faint and spent,"
12302,JACK HALL.,And out of breath;
12303,JACK HALL.,"At last he saw, quite evident,"
12304,JACK HALL.,The Door of Death.
12305,JACK HALL.,
12306,JACK HALL.,All other men had been unmann’d
12307,JACK HALL.,"To see a coffin on each hand,"
12308,JACK HALL.,That served a skeleton to stand
12309,JACK HALL.,By way of sentry;
12310,JACK HALL.,"In fact, Death has a very grand"
12311,JACK HALL.,And awful entry.
12312,JACK HALL.,
12313,JACK HALL.,"Throughout his dismal sign prevails,"
12314,JACK HALL.,His name is writ in coffin nails;
12315,JACK HALL.,The mortal darts make area rails;
12316,JACK HALL.,"A skull that mocketh,"
12317,JACK HALL.,"Grins on the gloomy gate, and quails"
12318,JACK HALL.,Whoever knocketh.
12319,JACK HALL.,
12320,JACK HALL.,"And lo! on either side, arise"
12321,JACK HALL.,Two monstrous pillars--bones of thighs;
12322,JACK HALL.,A monumental slab supplies
12323,JACK HALL.,"The step of stone,"
12324,JACK HALL.,Where waiting for his master lies
12325,JACK HALL.,A dog of bone.
12326,JACK HALL.,
12327,JACK HALL.,"The dog leapt up, but gave no yell,"
12328,JACK HALL.,"The wire was pull’d, but woke no bell,"
12329,JACK HALL.,"The ghastly knocker rose and fell,"
12330,JACK HALL.,But caused no riot;
12331,JACK HALL.,"The ways of Death, we all know well,"
12332,JACK HALL.,Are very quiet.
12333,JACK HALL.,
12334,JACK HALL.,Old Bones stept in; Jack stepp’d behind;
12335,JACK HALL.,"Quoth Death, I really hope you’ll find"
12336,JACK HALL.,"The entertainment to your mind,"
12337,JACK HALL.,As I shall treat ye--
12338,JACK HALL.,"A friend or two of goblin kind,"
12339,JACK HALL.,I’ve asked to meet ye.
12340,JACK HALL.,
12341,JACK HALL.,"And lo! a crowd of spectres tall,"
12342,JACK HALL.,"Like jack-a-lanterns on a wall,"
12343,JACK HALL.,Were standing--every ghastly ball--
12344,JACK HALL.,An eager watcher.
12345,JACK HALL.,"“My friend,” says Death--“friends, Mr. Hall,"
12346,JACK HALL.,The body-snatcher.”
12347,JACK HALL.,
12348,JACK HALL.,"Lord, what a tumult it produced,"
12349,JACK HALL.,When Mr. Hall was introduced!
12350,JACK HALL.,"Jack even, who had long been used"
12351,JACK HALL.,"To frightful things,"
12352,JACK HALL.,Felt just as if his back was sluic’d
12353,JACK HALL.,With freezing springs!
12354,JACK HALL.,
12355,JACK HALL.,Each goblin face began to make
12356,JACK HALL.,Some horrid mouth--ape--gorgon--snake;
12357,JACK HALL.,And then a spectre-hag would shake
12358,JACK HALL.,An airy thigh-bone;
12359,JACK HALL.,"And cried, (or seem’d to cry,) I’ll break"
12360,JACK HALL.,"Your bone, with my bone!"
12361,JACK HALL.,
12362,JACK HALL.,Some ground their teeth--some seem’d to spit--
12363,JACK HALL.,"(Nothing, but nothing came of it,)"
12364,JACK HALL.,A hundred awful brows were knit
12365,JACK HALL.,In dreadful spite.
12366,JACK HALL.,Thought Jack--“I’m sure I’d better quit
12367,JACK HALL.,Without good-night.”
12368,JACK HALL.,
12369,JACK HALL.,"One skip and hop and he was clear,"
12370,JACK HALL.,"And running like a hunted deer,"
12371,JACK HALL.,As fleet as people run by fear
12372,JACK HALL.,"Well spurr’d and whipp’d,"
12373,JACK HALL.,"Death, ghosts, and all in that career"
12374,JACK HALL.,Were quite outstripp’d.
12375,JACK HALL.,
12376,JACK HALL.,But those who live by death must die;
12377,JACK HALL.,Jack’s soul at last prepared to fly;
12378,JACK HALL.,"And when his latter end drew nigh,"
12379,JACK HALL.,Oh! what a swarm
12380,JACK HALL.,"Of doctors came,--but not to try"
12381,JACK HALL.,To keep him warm.
12382,JACK HALL.,
12383,JACK HALL.,No ravens ever scented prey
12384,JACK HALL.,"So early where a dead horse lay,"
12385,JACK HALL.,Nor vulture sniff’d so far away
12386,JACK HALL.,A last convulse:
12387,JACK HALL.,A dozen “guests” day after day
12388,JACK HALL.,Were “at his pulse.”
12389,JACK HALL.,
12390,JACK HALL.,"’Twas strange, altho’ they got no fees,"
12391,JACK HALL.,"How still they watch’d by twos and threes,"
12392,JACK HALL.,But Jack a very little ease
12393,JACK HALL.,Obtain’d from them;
12394,JACK HALL.,In fact he did not find M. D.’s
12395,JACK HALL.,Worth one D----M.
12396,JACK HALL.,
12397,JACK HALL.,The passing bell with hollow toll
12398,JACK HALL.,Was in his thought--the dreary hole!
12399,JACK HALL.,"Jack gave his eyes a horrid roll,"
12400,JACK HALL.,And then a cough:--
12401,JACK HALL.,“There’s something weighing on my soul
12402,JACK HALL.,I wish was off;
12403,JACK HALL.,
12404,JACK HALL.,"“All night it roves about my brains,"
12405,JACK HALL.,"All day it adds to all my pains,"
12406,JACK HALL.,It is concerning my remains
12407,JACK HALL.,When I am dead:”
12408,JACK HALL.,Twelve wigs and twelve gold-headed canes
12409,JACK HALL.,Drew near his bed.
12410,JACK HALL.,
12411,JACK HALL.,"“Alas!” he sigh’d, “I’m sore afraid"
12412,JACK HALL.,A dozen pangs my heart invade;
12413,JACK HALL.,But when I drove a certain trade

12463,HER PEDIGREE.,To trace the Kilmansegg pedigree

12471,HER PEDIGREE.,It wouldn’t require much verbal strain

12487,HER PEDIGREE.,"A Lord of Land, on his own estate,"

12492,HER PEDIGREE.,The very ewe’s and lambkin’s teeth

12496,HER PEDIGREE.,A flock of sheep for a birthday gift
12497,HER PEDIGREE.,"To each son of his loins, or daughter:"

12564,HER BIRTH.,
12565,HER BIRTH.,"Into this world we come like ships,"
12566,HER BIRTH.,"Launch’d from the docks, and stocks, and slips,"

12568,HER BIRTH.,And one little craft is cast away
12569,HER BIRTH.,"In its very first trip in Babbicome Bay,"
12570,HER BIRTH.,While another rides safe at Port Natal.
12571,HER BIRTH.,
12572,HER BIRTH.,What different lots our stars accord!
12573,HER BIRTH.,This babe to be hail’d and woo’d as a Lord!

12587,HER BIRTH.,"Born of Fortunatus’s kin,"

12605,HER BIRTH.,"To plait the straw, or bind the shoe,"
12606,HER BIRTH.,"Or sit all day to hem and sew,"
12607,HER BIRTH.,As females must--and not a few--
12608,HER BIRTH.,To fill their insides with stitches!
12609,HER BIRTH.,
12610,HER BIRTH.,"She was not doom’d, for bread to eat,"
12611,HER BIRTH.,To be put to her hands as well as her feet--
12612,HER BIRTH.,To carry home linen from mangles--
12613,HER BIRTH.,"Or heavy-hearted, and weary-limb’d,"
12614,HER BIRTH.,To dance on a rope in a jacket trimm’d
12615,HER BIRTH.,With as many blows as spangles.
12616,HER BIRTH.,
12617,HER BIRTH.,She was one of those who by Fortune’s boon

12631,HER BIRTH.,"For although, by the vulgar popular saw,"

12633,HER BIRTH.,Some children are born in clover.
12634,HER BIRTH.,
12635,HER BIRTH.,"Her very first draught of vital air,"

12637,HER BIRTH.,"Of plebeian lungs and noses,--"
12638,HER BIRTH.,No--her earliest sniff
12639,HER BIRTH.,Of this world was a whiff
12640,HER BIRTH.,Of the genuine Otto of Roses!
12641,HER BIRTH.,
12642,HER BIRTH.,"When she saw the light, it was no mere ray"
12643,HER BIRTH.,Of that light so common--so everyday--
12644,HER BIRTH.,That the sun each morning launches--
12645,HER BIRTH.,"But six wax tapers dazzled her eyes,"
12646,HER BIRTH.,From a thing--a gooseberry bush for size--
12647,HER BIRTH.,With a golden stem and branches.
12648,HER BIRTH.,
12649,HER BIRTH.,"She was born exactly at half-past two,"
12650,HER BIRTH.,As witnessed a time-piece in or-molu

12652,HER BIRTH.,"Showing at once the time of day,"

12658,HER BIRTH.,
12659,HER BIRTH.,"Like other babes, at her birth she cried;"
12660,HER BIRTH.,Which made a sensation far and wide--
12661,HER BIRTH.,"Ay, for twenty miles around her:"
12662,HER BIRTH.,For though to the ear ’twas nothing more
12663,HER BIRTH.,"Than an infant’s squall, it was really the roar"
12664,HER BIRTH.,Of a Fifty-thousand Pounder!
12665,HER BIRTH.,It shook the next heir
12666,HER BIRTH.,"In his library chair,"
12667,HER BIRTH.,"And made him cry, “Confound her!”"
12668,HER BIRTH.,
12669,HER BIRTH.,"Of signs and omens there was no dearth,"
12670,HER BIRTH.,"Any more than at Owen Glendower’s birth,"

12672,HER BIRTH.,"Two bullocks dropp’d dead,"
12673,HER BIRTH.,"As if knock’d on the head,"
12674,HER BIRTH.,And barrels of stout
12675,HER BIRTH.,"And ale ran about,"
12676,HER BIRTH.,"And the village-bells such a peal rang out,"
12677,HER BIRTH.,That they crack’d the village-steeple.
12678,HER BIRTH.,
12679,HER BIRTH.,"In no time at all, like mushroom spawn,"
12680,HER BIRTH.,Tables sprang up all over the lawn;
12681,HER BIRTH.,"Not furnish’d scantly or shabbily,"
12682,HER BIRTH.,But on scale as vast

12684,HER BIRTH.,With its loads and cargoes
12685,HER BIRTH.,"Of drink and botargoes,"
12686,HER BIRTH.,At the birth of the Babe in Rabelais.
12687,HER BIRTH.,
12688,HER BIRTH.,"Hundreds of men were turn’d into beasts,"

12691,HER BIRTH.,"And each country lass, and each country lad,"
12692,HER BIRTH.,"Began to caper and dance like mad,"
12693,HER BIRTH.,And ev’n some old ones appear’d to have had
12694,HER BIRTH.,A bite from the Naples Spider.
12695,HER BIRTH.,
12696,HER BIRTH.,"Then as night came on,"
12697,HER BIRTH.,It had scared King John
12698,HER BIRTH.,"Who considered such signs not risible,"
12699,HER BIRTH.,"To have seen the maroons,"
12700,HER BIRTH.,"And the whirling moons,"
12701,HER BIRTH.,"And the serpents of flame,"

12703,HER BIRTH.,That according to some were “whizzable.”
12704,HER BIRTH.,
12705,HER BIRTH.,"Oh, happy Hope of the Kilmanseggs!"
12706,HER BIRTH.,"Thrice happy in head, and body, and legs,"
12707,HER BIRTH.,That her parents had such full pockets!

12709,HER BIRTH.,"For care and nursing all adrift,"
12710,HER BIRTH.,It’s ten to one she had had to make shift
12711,HER BIRTH.,With rickets instead of rockets!
12712,HER BIRTH.,
12713,HER BIRTH.,And how was the precious baby drest?
12714,HER BIRTH.,"In a robe of the East, with lace of the West,"
12715,HER BIRTH.,Like one of Crœsus’ issue--
12716,HER BIRTH.,Her best bibs were made
12717,HER BIRTH.,"Of rich gold brocade,"
12718,HER BIRTH.,And the others of silver tissue.
12719,HER BIRTH.,
12720,HER BIRTH.,And when the Baby inclined to nap
12721,HER BIRTH.,"She was lull’d on a Gros de Naples lap,"
12722,HER BIRTH.,"By a nurse in a modish Paris cap,"
12723,HER BIRTH.,"Of notions so exalted,"
12724,HER BIRTH.,"She drank nothing lower than Curaçoa,"
12725,HER BIRTH.,"Maraschino, or pink Noyau,"
12726,HER BIRTH.,And on principle never malted.
12727,HER BIRTH.,
12728,HER BIRTH.,"From a golden boat, with a golden spoon,"
12729,HER BIRTH.,"The babe was fed night, morning, and noon;"
12730,HER BIRTH.,"And although the tale seems fabulous,"
12731,HER BIRTH.,"’Tis said her tops and bottoms were gilt,"
12732,HER BIRTH.,Like the oats in that Stable-yard Palace built
12733,HER BIRTH.,For the Horse of Heliogabalus.
12734,HER BIRTH.,
12735,HER BIRTH.,And when she took to squall and kick--
12736,HER BIRTH.,"For pain will ring, and pins will prick,"
12737,HER BIRTH.,E’en the wealthiest nabob’s daughter--
12738,HER BIRTH.,"They gave her no vulgar Dalby or gin,"

12740,HER BIRTH.,"Videlicet,--Dantzic Water."
12741,HER BIRTH.,
12742,HER BIRTH.,"In short, she was born, and bred, and nurst,"
12743,HER BIRTH.,"And drest in the best from the very first,"
12744,HER BIRTH.,To please the genteelest censor--
12745,HER BIRTH.,"And then, as soon as strength would allow"
12746,HER BIRTH.,"Was vaccinated, as babes are now,"

12820,HER CHRISTENING.,"The pen of an Eastern Poet would beg,"

12822,HER CHRISTENING.,"How she sparkled with gems whenever she stirr’d,"
12823,HER CHRISTENING.,"And her head niddle-noddled at every word,"
12824,HER CHRISTENING.,"And seem’d so happy, a Paradise Bird"
12825,HER CHRISTENING.,Had nidificated upon it.
12826,HER CHRISTENING.,
12827,HER CHRISTENING.,"And Sir Jacob the Father strutted and bow’d,"
12828,HER CHRISTENING.,"And smiled to himself, and laugh’d aloud,"
12829,HER CHRISTENING.,To think of his heiress and daughter--
12830,HER CHRISTENING.,"And then in his pockets he made a grope,"
12831,HER CHRISTENING.,"And then, in the fulness of joy and hope,"
12832,HER CHRISTENING.,Seem’d washing his hands with invisible soap
12833,HER CHRISTENING.,In imperceptible water.
12834,HER CHRISTENING.,
12835,HER CHRISTENING.,"He had roll’d in money like pigs in mud,"
12836,HER CHRISTENING.,Till it seem’d to have entered into his blood
12837,HER CHRISTENING.,By some occult projection:
12838,HER CHRISTENING.,And his cheeks instead of a healthy hue
12839,HER CHRISTENING.,"As yellow as any guinea grew,"
12840,HER CHRISTENING.,"Making the common phrase seem true,"
12841,HER CHRISTENING.,About a rich complexion.
12842,HER CHRISTENING.,
12843,HER CHRISTENING.,"And now came the nurse, and during a pause,"
12844,HER CHRISTENING.,Her dead-leaf satin would fitly cause
12845,HER CHRISTENING.,A very autumnal rustle--
12846,HER CHRISTENING.,"So full of figure, so full of fuss,"
12847,HER CHRISTENING.,"As she carried about the babe to buss,"

12849,HER CHRISTENING.,
12850,HER CHRISTENING.,"A wealthy Nabob was Godpapa,"
12851,HER CHRISTENING.,"And an Indian Begum was Godmamma,"

12853,HER CHRISTENING.,"And the Priest was a Vicar, and Dean withal"
12854,HER CHRISTENING.,"Of that Temple we see with a Golden Ball,"

12857,HER CHRISTENING.,"The Font was a bowl of American gold,"
12858,HER CHRISTENING.,"Won by Raleigh in days of old,"

12861,HER CHRISTENING.,"With gilt devices, it shone in the sun"
12862,HER CHRISTENING.,Like a copy--a presentation one--
12863,HER CHRISTENING.,Of Humboldt’s “El Dorado.”

12865,HER CHRISTENING.,Gold! and gold! and nothing but gold!

12868,HER CHRISTENING.,On the walls--the sideboard--the ceiling-sky--
12869,HER CHRISTENING.,"On the gorgeous footmen standing by,"
12870,HER CHRISTENING.,In coats to delight a miner’s eye
12871,HER CHRISTENING.,With seams of the precious metal.
12872,HER CHRISTENING.,
12873,HER CHRISTENING.,"Gold! and gold! and besides the gold,"
12874,HER CHRISTENING.,The very robe of the infant told
12875,HER CHRISTENING.,"A tale of wealth in every fold,"
12876,HER CHRISTENING.,It lapp’d her like a vapour!
12877,HER CHRISTENING.,So fine! so thin! the mind at a loss
12878,HER CHRISTENING.,Could compare it to nothing except a cross
12879,HER CHRISTENING.,Of cobweb with bank-note paper.
12880,HER CHRISTENING.,
12881,HER CHRISTENING.,"Then her pearls--’twas a perfect sight, forsooth,"
12882,HER CHRISTENING.,"To see them, like “the dew of her youth,”"
12883,HER CHRISTENING.,In such a plentiful sprinkle.
12884,HER CHRISTENING.,"Meanwhile, the Vicar read through the form,"
12885,HER CHRISTENING.,"And gave her another, not overwarm,"

12887,HER CHRISTENING.,
12888,HER CHRISTENING.,Then the babe was cross’d and bless’d amain!
12889,HER CHRISTENING.,"But instead of the Kate, or Ann, or Jane,"

12891,HER CHRISTENING.,"Instead of one name, as some people prefix,"
12892,HER CHRISTENING.,"Kilmansegg went at the tails of six,"
12893,HER CHRISTENING.,Like a carriage of state with its horses.
12894,HER CHRISTENING.,
12895,HER CHRISTENING.,"Oh, then the kisses she got and hugs!"
12896,HER CHRISTENING.,The golden mugs and the golden jugs
12897,HER CHRISTENING.,That lent fresh rays to the midges!
12898,HER CHRISTENING.,"The golden knives, and the golden spoons,"
12899,HER CHRISTENING.,"The gems that sparkled like fairy boons,"
12900,HER CHRISTENING.,"It was one of the Kilmansegg’s own saloons,"
12901,HER CHRISTENING.,But look’d like Rundell and Bridge’s!
12902,HER CHRISTENING.,
12903,HER CHRISTENING.,"Gold! and gold! the new and the old,"
12904,HER CHRISTENING.,"The company ate and drank from gold,"
12905,HER CHRISTENING.,"They revell’d, they sang, and were merry;"
12906,HER CHRISTENING.,"And one of the Gold Sticks rose from his chair,"
12907,HER CHRISTENING.,And toasted “the Lass with the golden hair”
12908,HER CHRISTENING.,In a bumper of Golden Sherry.
12909,HER CHRISTENING.,
12910,HER CHRISTENING.,"Gold! still gold! it rain’d on the nurse,"
12911,HER CHRISTENING.,Who--un-like Danäe--was none the worse!
12912,HER CHRISTENING.,There was nothing but guineas glistening!
12913,HER CHRISTENING.,"Fifty were given to Doctor James,"

12932,HER CHILDHOOD.,That tempted his daddy so often to cut
12933,HER CHILDHOOD.,"His throat, or jump in the water-butt--"

12944,HER CHILDHOOD.,
12945,HER CHILDHOOD.,"But to leave the happy Phelim alone,"
12946,HER CHILDHOOD.,"Gnawing, perchance, a marrowless bone,"

12948,HER CHILDHOOD.,Turn we to little Miss Kilmansegg
12949,HER CHILDHOOD.,Cutting her first little toothy-peg

12962,HER CHILDHOOD.,"With extempore cartes she never play’d,"

12966,HER CHILDHOOD.,"The very puppet she had to pet,"
12967,HER CHILDHOOD.,"Like a bait for the “Nix my Dolly” set,"

12970,HER CHILDHOOD.,Gold! and gold! ’twas the burden still!
12971,HER CHILDHOOD.,To gain the Heiress’s early goodwill
12972,HER CHILDHOOD.,There was much corruption and bribery--
12973,HER CHILDHOOD.,The yearly cost of her golden toys
12974,HER CHILDHOOD.,Would have given half London’s Charity Boys
12975,HER CHILDHOOD.,And Charity Girls the annual joys
12976,HER CHILDHOOD.,Of a holiday dinner at Highbury.
12977,HER CHILDHOOD.,
12978,HER CHILDHOOD.,Bon-bons she ate from the gilt _cornet_;
12979,HER CHILDHOOD.,And gilded queens on St. Bartlemy’s day;

13216,HER ACCIDENT.,"Seems rushing past like the “arrowy Rhine,”"
13217,HER ACCIDENT.,"The houses have got on a railway line,"

13220,HER ACCIDENT.,She’ll lose her life! she is losing her breath!
13221,HER ACCIDENT.,"A cruel chase, she is chasing Death,"

13224,HER ACCIDENT.,"She clears that gate, which has clear’d itself"
13225,HER ACCIDENT.,"Since then, at Hyde Park Corner!"
13226,HER ACCIDENT.,
13227,HER ACCIDENT.,Alas! for the hope of the Kilmanseggs!
13228,HER ACCIDENT.,"For her head, her brains, her body, and legs,"
13229,HER ACCIDENT.,Her life’s not worth a copper!
13230,HER ACCIDENT.,"Willy-nilly,"
13231,HER ACCIDENT.,"In Piccadilly,"
13232,HER ACCIDENT.,"A hundred hearts turn sick and chilly,"
13233,HER ACCIDENT.,"A hundred voices cry, “Stop her!”"
13234,HER ACCIDENT.,"And one old gentleman stares and stands,"
13235,HER ACCIDENT.,"Shakes his head and lifts his hands,"
13236,HER ACCIDENT.,"And says, “How very improper!”"
13237,HER ACCIDENT.,
13238,HER ACCIDENT.,On and on!--what a perilous run!
13239,HER ACCIDENT.,"The iron rails seem all mingling in one,"
13240,HER ACCIDENT.,To shut out the Green Park scenery!
13241,HER ACCIDENT.,And now the Cellar its dangers reveals.
13242,HER ACCIDENT.,"She shudders--she shrieks--she’s doom’d, she feels,"
13243,HER ACCIDENT.,"To be torn by powers of horses and wheels,"
13244,HER ACCIDENT.,Like a spinner by steam machinery!
13245,HER ACCIDENT.,
13246,HER ACCIDENT.,"Sick with horror she shuts her eyes,"
13247,HER ACCIDENT.,"But the very stones seem uttering cries,"
13248,HER ACCIDENT.,"As they did to that Persian daughter,"
13249,HER ACCIDENT.,"When she climb’d up the steep vociferous hill,"
13250,HER ACCIDENT.,Her little silver flagon to fill
13251,HER ACCIDENT.,With the magical Golden Water!
13252,HER ACCIDENT.,
13253,HER ACCIDENT.,“Batter her! shatter her!
13254,HER ACCIDENT.,Throw and scatter her!”
13255,HER ACCIDENT.,Shouts each stony-hearted chatterer!
13256,HER ACCIDENT.,“Dash at the heavy Dover!
13257,HER ACCIDENT.,Spill her! kill her! tear and tatter her!
13258,HER ACCIDENT.,Smash her! crash her!” (the stones didn’t flatter her!)
13259,HER ACCIDENT.,“Kick her brains out! let her blood spatter her!
13260,HER ACCIDENT.,Roll on her over and over!”
13261,HER ACCIDENT.,
13262,HER ACCIDENT.,For so she gather’d the awful sense
13263,HER ACCIDENT.,"Of the street in its past unmacadamized tense,"
13264,HER ACCIDENT.,"As the wild horse overran it,--"
13265,HER ACCIDENT.,"His four heels making the clatter of six,"
13266,HER ACCIDENT.,"Like a Devil’s tattoo, play’d with iron sticks"
13267,HER ACCIDENT.,On a kettle-drum of granite!
13268,HER ACCIDENT.,
13269,HER ACCIDENT.,On! still on! she’s dazzled with hints
13270,HER ACCIDENT.,"Of oranges, ribbons, and colour’d prints,"
13271,HER ACCIDENT.,"A Kaleidoscope jumble of shapes and tints,"
13272,HER ACCIDENT.,"And human faces all flashing,"
13273,HER ACCIDENT.,"Bright and brief as the sparks from the flints,"
13274,HER ACCIDENT.,That the desperate hoof keeps dashing!
13275,HER ACCIDENT.,
13276,HER ACCIDENT.,On and on! still frightfully fast!
13277,HER ACCIDENT.,"Dover-street, Bond-street, all are past!"
13278,HER ACCIDENT.,But--yes--no--yes!--they’re down at last!
13279,HER ACCIDENT.,The Furies and Fates have found them!
13280,HER ACCIDENT.,"Down they go with sparkle and crash,"
13281,HER ACCIDENT.,Like a Bark that’s struck by the lightning flash--
13282,HER ACCIDENT.,There’s a shriek--and a sob--
13283,HER ACCIDENT.,And the dense dark mob
13284,HER ACCIDENT.,Like a billow closes around them!

13290,HER ACCIDENT.,“She’ll recover!”
13291,HER ACCIDENT.,“She won’t!”
13292,HER ACCIDENT.,"“She’s stirring! she’s living, by Nemesis!”"
13293,HER ACCIDENT.,"Gold, still gold! on counter and shelf!"
13294,HER ACCIDENT.,Golden dishes as plenty as delf;
13295,HER ACCIDENT.,Miss Kilmansegg’s coming again to herself
13296,HER ACCIDENT.,On an opulent Goldsmith’s premises!
13297,HER ACCIDENT.,
13298,HER ACCIDENT.,"Gold! fine gold!--both yellow and red,"
13299,HER ACCIDENT.,"Beaten, and molten--polish’d, and dead--"

13302,HER ACCIDENT.,
13303,HER ACCIDENT.,[Illustration: BARRISTER ON CIRCUIT.]
13304,HER ACCIDENT.,
13305,HER ACCIDENT.,To see the gold with profusion spread
13306,HER ACCIDENT.,In all forms of its manufacture!
13307,HER ACCIDENT.,"But what avails gold to Miss Kilmansegg,"
13308,HER ACCIDENT.,When the femoral bone of her dexter leg
13309,HER ACCIDENT.,Has met with a compound fracture?
13310,HER ACCIDENT.,
13311,HER ACCIDENT.,Gold may soothe Adversity’s smart;
13312,HER ACCIDENT.,"Nay, help to bind up a broken heart;"
13313,HER ACCIDENT.,But to try it on any other part
13314,HER ACCIDENT.,"Were as certain a disappointment,"
13315,HER ACCIDENT.,"As if one should rub the dish and plate,"
13316,HER ACCIDENT.,Taken out of a Staffordshire crate--
13317,HER ACCIDENT.,In the hope of a Golden Service of State--
13318,HER ACCIDENT.,With Singleton’s “Golden Ointment.”
13319,HER ACCIDENT.,
13320,HER ACCIDENT.,
13321,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,HER PRECIOUS LEG.
13322,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13323,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"“As the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined,”"
13324,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Is an adage often recall’d to mind,"
13325,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,Referring to juvenile bias:
13326,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"And never so well is the verity seen,"
13327,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"As when to the weak, warp’d side we lean,"
13328,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,While Life’s tempests and hurricanes try us.
13329,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13330,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,Even thus with Miss K. and her broken limb:
13331,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"By a very, very remarkable whim,"
13332,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,She show’d her early tuition:
13333,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,While the buds of character came into blow
13334,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,With a certain tinge that served to show
13335,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"The nursery culture long ago,"
13336,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,As the graft is known by fruition!
13337,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13338,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"For the King’s Physician, who nursed the case,"
13339,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"His verdict gave with an awful face,"
13340,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,And three others concurr’d to egg it;
13341,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"That the Patient to give old Death the slip,"
13342,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Like the Pope, instead of a personal trip,"
13343,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,Must send her Leg as a Legate.
13344,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13345,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,The limb was doom’d--it couldn’t be saved!
13346,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"And like other people the patient behaved,"
13347,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Nay, bravely that cruel parting braved,"
13348,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Which makes some persons so falter,"
13349,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"They rather would part, without a groan,"
13350,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"With the flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bone,"
13351,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,They obtain’d at St. George’s altar.
13352,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13353,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,But when it came to fitting the stump
13354,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,With a proxy limb--then flatly and plump
13355,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"She spoke, in the spirit olden;"
13356,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,She couldn’t--she shouldn’t--she wouldn’t have wood
13357,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Nor a leg of cork, if she never stood,"
13358,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"And she swore an oath, or something as good,"
13359,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,The proxy limb should be golden!
13360,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13361,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"A wooden leg! what, a sort of peg,"
13362,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,For your common Jockeys and Jennies!
13363,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"No, no, her mother might worry and plague--"
13364,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Weep, go down on her knees, and beg,"
13365,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,But nothing would move Miss Kilmansegg!
13366,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"She could--she would have a Golden Leg,"
13367,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,If it cost ten thousand guineas!
13368,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13369,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Wood indeed, in Forest or Park,"
13370,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"With its sylvan honours and feudal bark,"
13371,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,Is an aristocratic article:
13372,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"But split and sawn, and hack’d about town,"
13373,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Serving all needs of pauper or clown,"
13374,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,Trod on! stagger’d on! Wood cut down
13375,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,Is vulgar--fibre and particle.
13376,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13377,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,And Cork!--when the noble Cork Tree shades
13378,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"A lovely group of Castilian maids,"
13379,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,’Tis a thing for a song or sonnet!--
13380,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"But cork, as it stops the bottle of gin,"
13381,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Or bungs the beer--the _small_ beer--in,"
13382,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"It pierced her heart like a corking-pin,"
13383,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,To think of standing upon it!
13384,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13385,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"A Leg of Gold--solid gold throughout,"
13386,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Nothing else, whether slim or stout,"
13387,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Should ever support her, God willing!"
13388,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"She must--she could--she would have her whim,"
13389,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Her father, she turn’d a deaf ear to him--"
13390,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,He might kill her--she didn’t mind killing!
13391,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,He was welcome to cut off her other limb--
13392,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,He might cut her all off with a shilling!
13393,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13394,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"All other promised gifts were in vain,"
13395,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Golden Girdle, or Golden Chain,"
13396,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"She writhed with impatience more than pain,"
13397,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,And utter’d “pshaws!” and “pishes!”
13398,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"But a Leg of Gold as she lay in bed,"
13399,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,It danced before her--it ran in her head!
13400,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,It jump’d with her dearest wishes!
13401,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13402,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"“Gold--gold--gold! Oh, let it be gold!”"
13403,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Asleep or awake that tale she told,"
13404,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,And when she grew delirious;
13405,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Till her parents resolved to grant her wish,"
13406,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"If they melted down plate, and goblet, and dish,"
13407,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,The case was getting so serious.
13408,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13409,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"So a Leg was made in a comely mould,"
13410,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Of Gold, fine virgin glittering gold,"
13411,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,As solid as man could made it--
13412,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Solid in foot, and calf, and shank,"
13413,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,A prodigious sum of money it sank;
13414,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"In fact ’twas a Branch of the family Bank,"
13415,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,And no easy matter to break it.
13416,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13417,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"All sterling metal--not half-and-half,"
13418,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,The Goldsmith’s mark was stamp’d on the calf--
13419,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,’Twas pure as from Mexican barter!
13420,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"And to make it more costly, just over the knee,"
13421,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Where another ligature used to be,"
13422,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Was a circle of jewels, worth shillings to see,"
13423,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,A new-fangled Badge of the Garter!
13424,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13425,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"’Twas a splendid, brilliant, beautiful Leg,"
13426,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Fit for the Court of Scander-Beg,"
13427,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,That Precious Leg of Miss Kilmansegg!
13428,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"For, thanks to parental bounty,"
13429,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,"Secure from Mortification’s touch,"
13430,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,She stood on a Member that cost as much
13431,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,As a Member for all the County!
13432,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13433,HER PRECIOUS LEG.,
13434,HER FAME.,HER FAME.
13435,HER FAME.,
13436,HER FAME.,"To gratify stern ambition’s whims,"

13439,HER FAME.,"Sever’d by sword, or bullet, or saw,"
13440,HER FAME.,"Off they go, all bleeding and raw,--"
13441,HER FAME.,But the public seems to get the lock-jaw
13442,HER FAME.,So little is said on the matter!
13443,HER FAME.,
13444,HER FAME.,"Legs, the tightest that ever were seen,"
13445,HER FAME.,"The tightest, the lightest, that danced on the green,"
13446,HER FAME.,Cutting capers to sweet Kitty Clover;
13447,HER FAME.,"Shatter’d, scatter’d, cut, and bowl’d down,"
13448,HER FAME.,"Off they go, worse off for renown,"
13449,HER FAME.,"A line in the _Times_, or a talk about town,"
13450,HER FAME.,Than the leg that a fly runs over!
13451,HER FAME.,
13452,HER FAME.,"But the Precious Leg of Miss Kilmansegg,"
13453,HER FAME.,"That gowden, goolden, golden leg,"
13454,HER FAME.,Was the theme of all conversation!
13455,HER FAME.,"Had it been a Pillar of Church and State,"
13456,HER FAME.,"Or a prop to support the whole Dead Weight,"
13457,HER FAME.,It could not have furnish’d more debate
13458,HER FAME.,To the heads and tails of the nation!
13459,HER FAME.,
13460,HER FAME.,"East and west, and north and south,"
13461,HER FAME.,"Though useless for either hunger or drouth,--"
13462,HER FAME.,"The Leg was in everybody’s mouth,"
13463,HER FAME.,"To use a poetical figure,"
13464,HER FAME.,"Rumour, in taking her ravenous swim,"
13465,HER FAME.,"Saw, and seized on the tempting limb,"
13466,HER FAME.,Like a shark on the leg of a nigger.
13467,HER FAME.,
13468,HER FAME.,Wilful murder fell very dead;
13469,HER FAME.,Debates in the House were hardly read;
13470,HER FAME.,In vain the Police Reports were fed
13471,HER FAME.,With Irish riots and _rumpuses_--
13472,HER FAME.,"The Leg! the Leg! was the great event,"
13473,HER FAME.,"Through every circle in life it went,"

13476,HER FAME.,"The last new Novel seem’d tame and flat,"

13480,HER FAME.,"And, alas! how Wealth over Wit play’s the Turk!"
13481,HER FAME.,"As a regular piece of goldsmith’s work,"
13482,HER FAME.,Got the better of Goldsmith’s diction.
13483,HER FAME.,
13484,HER FAME.,“A leg of gold! what of solid gold!”
13485,HER FAME.,"Cried rich and poor, and young and old,--"
13486,HER FAME.,And Master and Miss and Madam--
13487,HER FAME.,’Twas the talk of ‘Change--the Alley--the Bank--
13488,HER FAME.,"And with men of scientific rank,"
13489,HER FAME.,It made as much stir as the fossil shank
13490,HER FAME.,Of a Lizard coeval with Adam!
13491,HER FAME.,
13492,HER FAME.,"Of course with Greenwich and Chelsea elves,"
13493,HER FAME.,"Men who had lost a limb themselves,"
13494,HER FAME.,Its interest did not dwindle--
13495,HER FAME.,"But Bill, and Ben, and Jack, and Tom"
13496,HER FAME.,Could hardly have spun more yarns therefrom
13497,HER FAME.,If the leg had been a spindle.

13499,HER FAME.,"Meanwhile the story went to and fro,"

13516,HER FAME.,
13517,HER FAME.,"The Golden Leg had a vast career,"

13602,HER FANCY BALL.,"To the malice and spite of a party next door,"
13603,HER FANCY BALL.,To a party not invited.
13604,HER FANCY BALL.,
13605,HER FANCY BALL.,"On with the cap and out with the light,"
13606,HER FANCY BALL.,"Weariness bids the world good night,"
13607,HER FANCY BALL.,At least for the usual season;
13608,HER FANCY BALL.,But hark! a clatter of horses’ heels!
13609,HER FANCY BALL.,"And Sleep and Silence are broken on wheels,"
13610,HER FANCY BALL.,Like Wilful Murder and Treason!
13611,HER FANCY BALL.,
13612,HER FANCY BALL.,Another crash--and the carriage goes--
13613,HER FANCY BALL.,Again poor Weariness seeks the repose
13614,HER FANCY BALL.,"That Nature demands, imperious;"
13615,HER FANCY BALL.,"But Echo takes up the burden now,"
13616,HER FANCY BALL.,"With a rattling chorus of row-de-dow-dow,"
13617,HER FANCY BALL.,"Till Silence herself seems making a row,"
13618,HER FANCY BALL.,Like a Quaker gone delirious!
13619,HER FANCY BALL.,
13620,HER FANCY BALL.,’Tis night--a winter night--and the stars
13621,HER FANCY BALL.,Are shining like winkin’--Venus and Mars
13622,HER FANCY BALL.,Are rolling along in their golden cars
13623,HER FANCY BALL.,Through the sky’s serene expansion--
13624,HER FANCY BALL.,"But vainly the stars dispense their rays,"
13625,HER FANCY BALL.,Venus and Mars are lost in the blaze
13626,HER FANCY BALL.,Of the Kilmanseggs’ luminous mansion!
13627,HER FANCY BALL.,
13628,HER FANCY BALL.,Up jumps Fear in a terrible fright!
13629,HER FANCY BALL.,"His bedchamber windows look so bright,--"
13630,HER FANCY BALL.,With light all the Square is glutted!
13631,HER FANCY BALL.,"Up he jumps, like a sole from the pan,"
13632,HER FANCY BALL.,"And a tremor sickens his inward man,"
13633,HER FANCY BALL.,"For he feels as only a gentleman can,"
13634,HER FANCY BALL.,Who thinks he’s being “gutted.”
13635,HER FANCY BALL.,
13636,HER FANCY BALL.,"Again Fear settles, all snug and warm,"
13637,HER FANCY BALL.,But only to dream of a dreadful storm
13638,HER FANCY BALL.,From Autumn’s sulphurous locker;
13639,HER FANCY BALL.,"But the only electrical body that falls,"
13640,HER FANCY BALL.,"Wears a negative coat, and positive smalls,"
13641,HER FANCY BALL.,And draws the peal that so appals
13642,HER FANCY BALL.,From the Kilmanseggs’ brazen knocker!
13643,HER FANCY BALL.,
13644,HER FANCY BALL.,’Tis Curiosity’s Benefit night--
13645,HER FANCY BALL.,"And perchance ’tis the English-Second-Sight,"
13646,HER FANCY BALL.,"But whatever it be, so be it--"
13647,HER FANCY BALL.,As the friends and guests of Miss Kilmansegg
13648,HER FANCY BALL.,"Crowd in to look at her Golden Leg,"
13649,HER FANCY BALL.,As many more
13650,HER FANCY BALL.,"Mob round the door,"
13651,HER FANCY BALL.,To see them going to see it!
13652,HER FANCY BALL.,
13653,HER FANCY BALL.,"In they go--in jackets, and cloaks,"
13654,HER FANCY BALL.,"Plumes, and bonnets, turbans, and toques,"
13655,HER FANCY BALL.,As if to a Congress of Nations:
13656,HER FANCY BALL.,"Greeks and Malays, with daggers and dirks,"
13657,HER FANCY BALL.,"Spaniards, Jews, Chinese, and Turks--"
13658,HER FANCY BALL.,"Some like original foreign works,"
13659,HER FANCY BALL.,But mostly like bad translations.
13660,HER FANCY BALL.,
13661,HER FANCY BALL.,"In they go, and to work like a pack,"
13662,HER FANCY BALL.,"Juan, Moses, and Shacabac--"
13663,HER FANCY BALL.,"Tom, and Jerry, and Springheel’d Jack,--"
13664,HER FANCY BALL.,For some of low Fancy are lovers--
13665,HER FANCY BALL.,"Skirting, zigzagging, casting about,"
13666,HER FANCY BALL.,"Here and there, and in and out,"
13667,HER FANCY BALL.,"With a crush, and a rush, for a full-bodied rout"
13668,HER FANCY BALL.,In one of the stiffest of covers.
13669,HER FANCY BALL.,
13670,HER FANCY BALL.,"In they went, and hunted about,"
13671,HER FANCY BALL.,"Open-mouth’d like chub and trout,"
13672,HER FANCY BALL.,"And some with the upper lip thrust out,"
13673,HER FANCY BALL.,"Like that fish for routing, a barbel--"
13674,HER FANCY BALL.,"While Sir Jacob stood to welcome the crowd,"
13675,HER FANCY BALL.,"And rubb’d his hands, and smiled aloud,"
13676,HER FANCY BALL.,"And bow’d, and bow’d, and bow’d, and bow’d,"
13677,HER FANCY BALL.,Like a man who is sawing marble.
13678,HER FANCY BALL.,
13679,HER FANCY BALL.,"For Princes were there, and Noble Peers;"
13680,HER FANCY BALL.,Dukes descended from Norman spears;
13681,HER FANCY BALL.,Earls that dated from early years;
13682,HER FANCY BALL.,And Lords in vast variety--
13683,HER FANCY BALL.,Besides the Gentry both new and old--
13684,HER FANCY BALL.,"For people who stand on legs of gold,"
13685,HER FANCY BALL.,Are sure to stand well with society.
13686,HER FANCY BALL.,
13687,HER FANCY BALL.,“But where--where--where?” with one accord
13688,HER FANCY BALL.,"Cried Moses and Mufti, Jack and my Lord,"
13689,HER FANCY BALL.,Wang-Fong and Il Bondocani--
13690,HER FANCY BALL.,"When slow, and heavy, and dead as a dump,"
13691,HER FANCY BALL.,"They heard a foot begin to stump,"
13692,HER FANCY BALL.,Thump! lump!
13693,HER FANCY BALL.,Lump! thump!
13694,HER FANCY BALL.,Like the Spectre in “Don Giovanni!”
13695,HER FANCY BALL.,
13696,HER FANCY BALL.,"And lo! the Heiress, Miss Kilmansegg,"
13697,HER FANCY BALL.,"With her splendid, brilliant, beautiful leg,"
13698,HER FANCY BALL.,In the garb of a Goddess olden--
13699,HER FANCY BALL.,"Like chaste Diana going to hunt,"
13700,HER FANCY BALL.,"With a golden spear--which of course was blunt,"
13701,HER FANCY BALL.,"And a tunic loop’d up to a gem in front,"
13702,HER FANCY BALL.,To show the Leg that was Golden!
13703,HER FANCY BALL.,
13704,HER FANCY BALL.,"Gold! still gold; her Crescent behold,"
13705,HER FANCY BALL.,"That should be silver, but would be gold;"
13706,HER FANCY BALL.,And her robe’s auriferous spangles!
13707,HER FANCY BALL.,Her golden stomacher--how she would melt!
13708,HER FANCY BALL.,"Her golden quiver, and golden belt,"
13709,HER FANCY BALL.,Where a golden bugle dangles!
13710,HER FANCY BALL.,
13711,HER FANCY BALL.,"And her jewell’d Garter! Oh, Sin, oh, Shame!"
13712,HER FANCY BALL.,"Let Pride and Vanity bear the blame,"
13713,HER FANCY BALL.,That bring such blots on female fame!
13714,HER FANCY BALL.,"But to be a true recorder,"
13715,HER FANCY BALL.,"Besides its thin transparent stuff,"
13716,HER FANCY BALL.,The tunic was loop’d quite high enough
13717,HER FANCY BALL.,To give a glimpse of the Order!
13718,HER FANCY BALL.,
13719,HER FANCY BALL.,But what have sin or shame to do
13720,HER FANCY BALL.,With a Golden Leg--and a stout one too?
13721,HER FANCY BALL.,Away with all Prudery’s panics!
13722,HER FANCY BALL.,"That the precious metal, by thick and thin,"
13723,HER FANCY BALL.,"Will cover square acres of land or sin,"
13724,HER FANCY BALL.,Is a fact made plain
13725,HER FANCY BALL.,"Again and again,"
13726,HER FANCY BALL.,In Morals as well as Mechanics.
13727,HER FANCY BALL.,
13728,HER FANCY BALL.,"A few, indeed, of her proper sex,"
13729,HER FANCY BALL.,"Who seem’d to feel her foot on their necks,"
13730,HER FANCY BALL.,And fear’d their charms would meet with checks
13731,HER FANCY BALL.,From so rare and splendid a blazon--
13732,HER FANCY BALL.,A few cried “fie!--and “forward”--and “bold!”
13733,HER FANCY BALL.,"And said of the Leg it might be gold,"
13734,HER FANCY BALL.,But to them it look’d like brazen!
13735,HER FANCY BALL.,
13736,HER FANCY BALL.,"’Twas hard they hinted for flesh and blood,"
13737,HER FANCY BALL.,"Virtue and Beauty, and all that’s good,"
13738,HER FANCY BALL.,To strike to mere dross their topgallants--
13739,HER FANCY BALL.,"But what were Beauty, or Virtue, or Worth,"
13740,HER FANCY BALL.,"Gentle manners, or gentle birth,"
13741,HER FANCY BALL.,"Nay, what the most talented head on earth"
13742,HER FANCY BALL.,To a Leg worth fifty Talents!
13743,HER FANCY BALL.,
13744,HER FANCY BALL.,But the men sang quite another hymn
13745,HER FANCY BALL.,Of glory and praise to the precious Limb--
13746,HER FANCY BALL.,"Age, sordid Age, admired the whim,"
13747,HER FANCY BALL.,And its indecorum pardon’d--
13748,HER FANCY BALL.,"While half of the young--ay, more than half--"
13749,HER FANCY BALL.,"Bow’d down and worshipp’d the Golden Calf,"
13750,HER FANCY BALL.,Like the Jews when their hearts were harden’d.
13751,HER FANCY BALL.,
13752,HER FANCY BALL.,A Golden Leg!--what fancies it fired!
13753,HER FANCY BALL.,What golden wishes and hopes inspired!
13754,HER FANCY BALL.,To give but a mere abridgment--
13755,HER FANCY BALL.,What a leg to leg-bail Embarrassment’s serf
13756,HER FANCY BALL.,What a leg for a Leg to take on the turf!
13757,HER FANCY BALL.,What a leg for a marching regiment!
13758,HER FANCY BALL.,
13759,HER FANCY BALL.,"A golden Leg!--whatever Love sings,"
13760,HER FANCY BALL.,’Twas worth a bushel of “Plain Gold Rings”
13761,HER FANCY BALL.,With which the Romantic wheedles.
13762,HER FANCY BALL.,’Twas worth all the legs in stockings and socks--
13763,HER FANCY BALL.,"’Twas a leg that might be put in the Stocks,"
13764,HER FANCY BALL.,N.B.--Not the parish beadle’s!
13765,HER FANCY BALL.,
13766,HER FANCY BALL.,"And Lady K. nid-nodded her head,"
13767,HER FANCY BALL.,"Lapp’d in a turban fancy-bred,"
13768,HER FANCY BALL.,"Just like a love-apple, huge and red,"
13769,HER FANCY BALL.,Some Mussul-womanish mystery;
13770,HER FANCY BALL.,But whatever she meant
13771,HER FANCY BALL.,"To represent,"
13772,HER FANCY BALL.,She talk’d like the Muse of History.
13773,HER FANCY BALL.,
13774,HER FANCY BALL.,She told how the filial leg was lost;
13775,HER FANCY BALL.,"And then how much the gold one cost,"
13776,HER FANCY BALL.,With its weight to a Trojan fraction:
13777,HER FANCY BALL.,"And how it took off, and how it put on;"
13778,HER FANCY BALL.,"And call’d on Devil, Duke, and Don,"
13779,HER FANCY BALL.,"Mahomet, Moses, and Prester John,"
13780,HER FANCY BALL.,To notice its beautiful action.
13781,HER FANCY BALL.,
13782,HER FANCY BALL.,And then of the Leg she went in quest;
13783,HER FANCY BALL.,And led it where the light was best;
13784,HER FANCY BALL.,And made it lay itself up to rest
13785,HER FANCY BALL.,In postures for painter’s studies.
13786,HER FANCY BALL.,"It cost more tricks and trouble by half,"
13787,HER FANCY BALL.,Than it takes to exhibit a six-legg’d Calf
13788,HER FANCY BALL.,To a boothful of country Cuddies.
13789,HER FANCY BALL.,
13790,HER FANCY BALL.,Nor yet did the Heiress herself omit
13791,HER FANCY BALL.,"The arts that help to make a hit,"
13792,HER FANCY BALL.,"And preserve a prominent station,"
13793,HER FANCY BALL.,She talk’d and laugh’d far more than her share;
13794,HER FANCY BALL.,And took a part in “Rich and Rare
13795,HER FANCY BALL.,Were the gems she wore”--and the gems were there
13796,HER FANCY BALL.,Like a Song with an Illustration.
13797,HER FANCY BALL.,
13798,HER FANCY BALL.,She even stood up with a Count of France
13799,HER FANCY BALL.,To dance--alas!--the measures we dance
13800,HER FANCY BALL.,When Vanity plays the Piper!
13801,HER FANCY BALL.,"Vanity, Vanity, apt to betray,"
13802,HER FANCY BALL.,"And lead all sorts of legs astray,"
13803,HER FANCY BALL.,"Wood, or metal, or human clay,--"
13804,HER FANCY BALL.,Since Satan first play’d the Viper!
13805,HER FANCY BALL.,
13806,HER FANCY BALL.,"But first she doff’d her hunting gear,"
13807,HER FANCY BALL.,And favour’d Tom Tug with her golden spear
13808,HER FANCY BALL.,To row with down the river--
13809,HER FANCY BALL.,A Bonze had her golden bow to hold;
13810,HER FANCY BALL.,A Hermit her belt and bugle of gold;
13811,HER FANCY BALL.,And an Abbot her golden quiver.
13812,HER FANCY BALL.,
13813,HER FANCY BALL.,"And then a space was clear’d on the floor,"
13814,HER FANCY BALL.,"And she walk’d the Minuet de la Cour,"
13815,HER FANCY BALL.,"With all the pomp of a Pompadour,"
13816,HER FANCY BALL.,"But although she began _andante_,"
13817,HER FANCY BALL.,"Conceive the faces of all the Rout,"
13818,HER FANCY BALL.,"When she finished off with a whirligig bout,"
13819,HER FANCY BALL.,And the Precious Leg stuck stiffly out
13820,HER FANCY BALL.,Like the leg of a _Figuranté_.
13821,HER FANCY BALL.,
13822,HER FANCY BALL.,"So the courtly dance was goldenly done,"
13823,HER FANCY BALL.,"And golden opinions, of course, it won"
13824,HER FANCY BALL.,From all different sorts of people--
13825,HER FANCY BALL.,"Chiming, ding-dong, with flattering phrase,"
13826,HER FANCY BALL.,"In one vociferous peal of praise,"
13827,HER FANCY BALL.,Like the peal that rings on Royal days
13828,HER FANCY BALL.,From Loyalty’s parish-steeple.
13829,HER FANCY BALL.,
13830,HER FANCY BALL.,"And yet, had the leg been one of those"
13831,HER FANCY BALL.,"That danced for bread in flesh-colour’d hose,"
13832,HER FANCY BALL.,"With Rosina’s pastoral bevy,"
13833,HER FANCY BALL.,"The jeers it had met,--the shouts! the scoff!"
13834,HER FANCY BALL.,"The cutting advice to “take itself off,”"
13835,HER FANCY BALL.,For sounding but half so heavy.
13836,HER FANCY BALL.,
13837,HER FANCY BALL.,"Had it been a leg like those, perchance,"
13838,HER FANCY BALL.,"That teach little girls and boys to dance,"
13839,HER FANCY BALL.,"To set, poussette, recede, and advance,"
13840,HER FANCY BALL.,"With the steps and figures most proper,--"
13841,HER FANCY BALL.,"Had it hopp’d for a weekly or quarterly sum,"
13842,HER FANCY BALL.,How little of praise or grist would have come
13843,HER FANCY BALL.,To a mill with such a hopper!
13844,HER FANCY BALL.,
13845,HER FANCY BALL.,But the Leg was none of those limbs forlorn--
13846,HER FANCY BALL.,Bartering capers and hops for corn--
13847,HER FANCY BALL.,"That meet with public hisses and scorn,"
13848,HER FANCY BALL.,Or the morning journal denounces--
13849,HER FANCY BALL.,"Had it pleased to caper from morn till dusk,"
13850,HER FANCY BALL.,There was all the music of “Money Musk”
13851,HER FANCY BALL.,In its ponderous bangs and bounces.
13852,HER FANCY BALL.,
13853,HER FANCY BALL.,"But hark;--as slow as the strokes of a pump,"
13854,HER FANCY BALL.,"Lump, thump!"
13855,HER FANCY BALL.,"Thump, lump!"
13856,HER FANCY BALL.,"As the Giant of Castle Otranto might stump,"
13857,HER FANCY BALL.,To a lower room from an upper--
13858,HER FANCY BALL.,"Down she goes with a noisy dint,"
13859,HER FANCY BALL.,"For taking the crimson turban’s hint,"
13860,HER FANCY BALL.,A noble Lord at the Head of the Mint
13861,HER FANCY BALL.,Is leading the Leg to supper!
13862,HER FANCY BALL.,
13863,HER FANCY BALL.,"But the supper, alas! must rest untold,"
13864,HER FANCY BALL.,"With its blaze of light and its glitter of gold,"
13865,HER FANCY BALL.,"For to paint that scene of glamour,"
13866,HER FANCY BALL.,It would need the Great Enchanter’s charm
13867,HER FANCY BALL.,"Who waves over Palace, and Cot, and Farm,"
13868,HER FANCY BALL.,An arm like the Goldbeater’s Golden Arm
13869,HER FANCY BALL.,That wields a Golden Hammer.
13870,HER FANCY BALL.,
13871,HER FANCY BALL.,He--only He--could fitly state
13872,HER FANCY BALL.,"The Massive Service of Golden Plate,"
13873,HER FANCY BALL.,With the proper phrase and expansion--
13874,HER FANCY BALL.,The Rare Selection of Foreign Wines--
13875,HER FANCY BALL.,"The Alps of Ice and Mountains of Pines,"
13876,HER FANCY BALL.,"The punch in Oceans and sugary shrines,"
13877,HER FANCY BALL.,The Temple of Taste from Gunter’s Designs--
13878,HER FANCY BALL.,"In short, all that Wealth with A Feast combines,"
13879,HER FANCY BALL.,In a Splendid Family Mansion.
13880,HER FANCY BALL.,
13881,HER FANCY BALL.,Suffice if each mask’d outlandish guest
13882,HER FANCY BALL.,"Ate and drank of the very best,"
13883,HER FANCY BALL.,According to critical conners--
13884,HER FANCY BALL.,"And then they pledged the Hostess and Host,"
13885,HER FANCY BALL.,"But the Golden Leg was the standing toast,"
13886,HER FANCY BALL.,"And as somebody swore,"
13887,HER FANCY BALL.,Walk’d off with more
13888,HER FANCY BALL.,Than its share of the “Hips!” and honours!
13889,HER FANCY BALL.,
13890,HER FANCY BALL.,“Miss Kilmansegg!--
13891,HER FANCY BALL.,Full glasses I beg!--
13892,HER FANCY BALL.,Miss Kilmansegg and her Precious Leg!”
13893,HER FANCY BALL.,And away went the bottle careering!
13894,HER FANCY BALL.,Wine in bumpers! and shouts in peals!
13895,HER FANCY BALL.,Till the clown didn’t know his head from his heels;
13896,HER FANCY BALL.,"The Mussulman’s eyes danced two-some reels,"
13897,HER FANCY BALL.,And the Quaker was hoarse with cheering!
13898,HER FANCY BALL.,
13899,HER FANCY BALL.,
13900,HER DREAM.,HER DREAM.
13901,HER DREAM.,
13902,HER DREAM.,"Miss Kilmansegg took off her leg,"
13903,HER DREAM.,"And laid it down like a cribbage-peg,"
13904,HER DREAM.,For the Rout was done and the riot:
13905,HER DREAM.,The Square was hush’d; not a sound was heard;
13906,HER DREAM.,"The sky was gray, and no creature stirr’d,"
13907,HER DREAM.,"Except one little precocious bird,"
13908,HER DREAM.,That chirp’d--and then was quiet.
13909,HER DREAM.,
13910,HER DREAM.,"So still without,--so still within;--"
13911,HER DREAM.,It had been a sin
13912,HER DREAM.,To drop a pin--
13913,HER DREAM.,"So intense is silence after a din,"
13914,HER DREAM.,It seem’d like Death’s rehearsal!
13915,HER DREAM.,To stir the air no eddy came;
13916,HER DREAM.,"And the taper burnt with as still a flame,"
13917,HER DREAM.,"As to flicker had been a burning shame,"
13918,HER DREAM.,In a calm so universal.
13919,HER DREAM.,
13920,HER DREAM.,The time for sleep had come at last;
13921,HER DREAM.,"And there was the bed, so soft, so vast,"
13922,HER DREAM.,Quite a field of Bedfordshire clover;
13923,HER DREAM.,"Softer, cooler, and calmer, no doubt,"
13924,HER DREAM.,"From the piece of work just ravell’d out,"
13925,HER DREAM.,For one of the pleasures of having a rout
13926,HER DREAM.,Is the pleasure of having it over.
13927,HER DREAM.,
13928,HER DREAM.,"No sordid pallet, or truckle mean,"
13929,HER DREAM.,"Of straw, and rug, and tatters unclean;"
13930,HER DREAM.,"But a splendid, gilded, carved machine,"
13931,HER DREAM.,That was fit for a Royal Chamber.
13932,HER DREAM.,On the top was a gorgeous golden wreath;
13933,HER DREAM.,"And the damask curtains hung beneath,"
13934,HER DREAM.,Like clouds of crimson and amber;
13935,HER DREAM.,
13936,HER DREAM.,"Curtains, held up by two little plump things,"
13937,HER DREAM.,"With golden bodies and golden wings,--"
13938,HER DREAM.,Mere fins for such solidities--
13939,HER DREAM.,"Two Cupids, in short,"
13940,HER DREAM.,"Of the regular sort,"
13941,HER DREAM.,But the housemaid call’d them “Cupidities.”
13942,HER DREAM.,
13943,HER DREAM.,"No patchwork quilt, all seams and scars,"
13944,HER DREAM.,"But velvet, powder’d with golden stars,"
13945,HER DREAM.,A fit mantle for _Night_-Commanders!
13946,HER DREAM.,"And the pillow, as white as snow undimm’d"
13947,HER DREAM.,"And as cool as the pool that the breeze has skimm’d,"
13948,HER DREAM.,"Was cased in the finest cambric, and trimm’d"
13949,HER DREAM.,With the costliest lace of Flanders.
13950,HER DREAM.,
13951,HER DREAM.,"And the bed--of the Eider’s softest down,"
13952,HER DREAM.,"’Twas a place to revel, to smother, to drown"
13953,HER DREAM.,In a bliss inferr’d by the Poet;
13954,HER DREAM.,"For if Ignorance be indeed a bliss,"
13955,HER DREAM.,"What blessed ignoaance equals this,"
13956,HER DREAM.,To sleep--and not to know it?
13957,HER DREAM.,
13958,HER DREAM.,"Oh, bed! oh, bed! delicious bed!"
13959,HER DREAM.,That heaven upon earth to the weary head;
13960,HER DREAM.,"But a place that to name would be ill-bred,"
13961,HER DREAM.,To the head with a wakeful trouble--
13962,HER DREAM.,’Tis held by such a different lease!
13963,HER DREAM.,"To one, a place of comfort and peace,"
13964,HER DREAM.,"All stuff’d with the down of stubble geese,"
13965,HER DREAM.,To another with only the stubble!
13966,HER DREAM.,
13967,HER DREAM.,"To one, a perfect Halcyon nest,"
13968,HER DREAM.,"All calm, and balm and quiet, and rest,"
13969,HER DREAM.,And soft as the fur of the cony--
13970,HER DREAM.,"To another, so restless for body and head,"
13971,HER DREAM.,"That the bed seems borrow’d from Nettlebed,"
13972,HER DREAM.,And the pillow from Stratford the Stony!
13973,HER DREAM.,
13974,HER DREAM.,"To the happy, a first-class carriage of ease,"
13975,HER DREAM.,"To the Land of Nod, or where you please;"
13976,HER DREAM.,"But alas! for the watchers and weepers,"
13977,HER DREAM.,"Who turn, and turn, and turn again,"
13978,HER DREAM.,"But turn, and turn, and turn in vain,"
13979,HER DREAM.,"With an anxious brain,"
13980,HER DREAM.,"And thoughts in a train,"
13981,HER DREAM.,That does not run upon _sleepers_!
13982,HER DREAM.,
13983,HER DREAM.,"Wide awake as the mousing owl,"
13984,HER DREAM.,"Night-hawk, or other nocturnal fowl,--"
13985,HER DREAM.,"But more profitless vigils keeping,--"
13986,HER DREAM.,"Wide awake in the dark they stare,"
13987,HER DREAM.,"Filling with phantoms the vacant air,"
13988,HER DREAM.,As if that Crook-back’d Tyrant Care
13989,HER DREAM.,Had plotted to kill them sleeping.
13990,HER DREAM.,
13991,HER DREAM.,And oh! when the blessed diurnal light
13992,HER DREAM.,"Is quench’d by the providential night,"
13993,HER DREAM.,To render our slumber more certain!
13994,HER DREAM.,"Pity, pity the wretches that weep,"
13995,HER DREAM.,"For they must be wretched, who cannot sleep"
13996,HER DREAM.,When God himself draws the curtain!
13997,HER DREAM.,
13998,HER DREAM.,"The careful Betty the pillow beats,"
13999,HER DREAM.,"And airs the blankets, and smooths the sheets,"
14000,HER DREAM.,And gives the mattress a shaking--
14001,HER DREAM.,"But vainly Betty performs her part,"
14002,HER DREAM.,"If a ruffled head and a rumpled heart,"
14003,HER DREAM.,"As well as the couch, want making."
14004,HER DREAM.,
14005,HER DREAM.,"There’s Morbid, all bile, and verjuice, and nerves,"
14006,HER DREAM.,"Where other people would make preserves,"
14007,HER DREAM.,He turns his fruits into pickles:
14008,HER DREAM.,"Jealous, envious, and fretful by day,"
14009,HER DREAM.,"At night, to his own sharp fancies a prey,"
14010,HER DREAM.,"He lies like a hedgehog roll’d up the wrong way,"
14011,HER DREAM.,Tormenting himself with his prickles.
14012,HER DREAM.,
14013,HER DREAM.,"But a child--that bids the world good night,"
14014,HER DREAM.,In downright earnest and cuts it quite--
14015,HER DREAM.,"A Cherub no Art can copy,--"
14016,HER DREAM.,’Tis a perfect picture to see him lie
14017,HER DREAM.,"As if he had supp’d on a dormouse pie,"
14018,HER DREAM.,"(An ancient classical dish, by the by)"
14019,HER DREAM.,With a sauce of syrup of poppy.
14020,HER DREAM.,
14021,HER DREAM.,"Oh, bed! bed! bed! delicious bed!"
14022,HER DREAM.,"That heaven upon earth to the weary head,"
14023,HER DREAM.,Whether lofty or low its condition!
14024,HER DREAM.,"But instead of putting our plagues on shelves,"
14025,HER DREAM.,"In our blankets how often we toss ourselves,"
14026,HER DREAM.,Or are toss’d by such allegorical elves
14027,HER DREAM.,"As Pride, Hate, Greed, and Ambition!"
14028,HER DREAM.,
14029,HER DREAM.,The independent Miss Kilmansegg
14030,HER DREAM.,Took off her independent Leg
14031,HER DREAM.,"And laid it beneath her pillow,"
14032,HER DREAM.,"And then on the bed her frame she cast,"
14033,HER DREAM.,"The time for repose had come at last,"
14034,HER DREAM.,"But long, long, after the storm is past"
14035,HER DREAM.,"Rolls the turbid, turbulent billow."
14036,HER DREAM.,
14037,HER DREAM.,No part she had in vulgar cares
14038,HER DREAM.,That belong to common household affairs--
14039,HER DREAM.,"Nocturnal annoyances such as theirs,"
14040,HER DREAM.,"Who lie with a shrewd surmising,"
14041,HER DREAM.,That while they are couchant (a bitter cup!)
14042,HER DREAM.,"Their bread and butter are getting up,"
14043,HER DREAM.,"And the coals, confound them, are rising."
14044,HER DREAM.,
14045,HER DREAM.,"No fear she had her sleep to postpone,"
14046,HER DREAM.,Like the crippled Widow who weeps alone
14047,HER DREAM.,"And cannot make a doze her own,"
14048,HER DREAM.,"For the dread that mayhap on the morrow,"
14049,HER DREAM.,"The true and Christian reading to baulk,"
14050,HER DREAM.,A broker will take up her bed and walk
14051,HER DREAM.,By way of curing her sorrow.
14052,HER DREAM.,
14053,HER DREAM.,"No cause like these she had to bewail,"
14054,HER DREAM.,"But the breath of applause had blown a gale,"
14055,HER DREAM.,And winds from that quarter seldom fail
14056,HER DREAM.,To cause some human commotion;
14057,HER DREAM.,But whenever such breezes coincide
14058,HER DREAM.,With the very spring-tide
14059,HER DREAM.,"Of human pride,"
14060,HER DREAM.,There’s no such swell on the ocean!
14061,HER DREAM.,
14062,HER DREAM.,"Peace, and ease, and slumber lost,"
14063,HER DREAM.,"She turn’d, and roll’d, and tumbled and toss’d"
14064,HER DREAM.,With a tumult that would not settle:
14065,HER DREAM.,"A common case, indeed, with such"
14066,HER DREAM.,"As have too little, or think too much,"
14067,HER DREAM.,Of the precious and glittering metal.
14068,HER DREAM.,
14069,HER DREAM.,Gold!--she saw at her golden foot
14070,HER DREAM.,"The Peer whose tree had an olden root,"
14071,HER DREAM.,"The Proud, the Great, the Learned to boot,"
14072,HER DREAM.,"The handsome, the gay, and the witty--"
14073,HER DREAM.,"The Man of Science--of Arms--of Art,"
14074,HER DREAM.,"The man who deals but at Pleasure’s mart,"
14075,HER DREAM.,And the man who deals in the City.
14076,HER DREAM.,
14077,HER DREAM.,"Gold, still gold--and true to the mould!"
14078,HER DREAM.,In the very scheme of her dream it told;
14079,HER DREAM.,"For, by magical transmutation,"
14080,HER DREAM.,"From her Leg through her body it seem’d to go,"
14081,HER DREAM.,"Till, gold above, and gold below,"
14082,HER DREAM.,"She was gold, all gold, from her little gold toe"
14083,HER DREAM.,To her organ of Veneration!
14084,HER DREAM.,
14085,HER DREAM.,"And still she retain’d through Fancy’s art,"
14086,HER DREAM.,"The Golden Bow and Golden Dart,"
14087,HER DREAM.,"With which she had play’d a Goddess’s part,"
14088,HER DREAM.,In her recent glorification:
14089,HER DREAM.,"And still, like one of the self-same brood,"
14090,HER DREAM.,On a Plinth of the self-same metal she stood
14091,HER DREAM.,For the whole world’s adoration.
14092,HER DREAM.,
14093,HER DREAM.,"And hymns and incense around her roll’d,"
14094,HER DREAM.,"From Golden Harps and Censers of Gold,--"
14095,HER DREAM.,For Fancy in dreams is as uncontroll’d
14096,HER DREAM.,As a horse without a bridle:
14097,HER DREAM.,"What wonder, then, from all checks exempt,"
14098,HER DREAM.,"If, inspired by the Golden Leg, she dreamt"
14099,HER DREAM.,She was turn’d to a Golden Idol?
14100,HER DREAM.,
14101,HER DREAM.,
14102,HER COURTSHIP.,HER COURTSHIP.
14103,HER COURTSHIP.,
14104,HER COURTSHIP.,When leaving Eden’s happy land
14105,HER COURTSHIP.,The grieving Angel led by the hand
14106,HER COURTSHIP.,"Our banish’d Father and Mother,"
14107,HER COURTSHIP.,"Forgotten amid their awful doom,"
14108,HER COURTSHIP.,"The tears, the fears, and the future’s gloom,"
14109,HER COURTSHIP.,"On each brow was a wreath of Paradise bloom,"
14110,HER COURTSHIP.,That our Parents had twined for each other.
14111,HER COURTSHIP.,
14112,HER COURTSHIP.,"It was only while sitting like figures of stone,"
14113,HER COURTSHIP.,"For the grieving angel had skyward flown,"
14114,HER COURTSHIP.,"As they sat, those Two in the world alone,"
14115,HER COURTSHIP.,"With disconsolate hearts nigh cloven,"
14116,HER COURTSHIP.,"That scenting the gust of happier hours,"
14117,HER COURTSHIP.,"They look’d around for the precious flow’rs,"
14118,HER COURTSHIP.,And lo!--a last relic of Eden’s dear bow’rs--
14119,HER COURTSHIP.,The chaplet that Love had woven!
14120,HER COURTSHIP.,
14121,HER COURTSHIP.,"And still, when a pair of Lovers meet,"
14122,HER COURTSHIP.,"There’s a sweetness in air, unearthly sweet,"
14123,HER COURTSHIP.,That savours still of that happy retreat
14124,HER COURTSHIP.,Where Eve by Adam was courted:
14125,HER COURTSHIP.,"Whilst the joyous Thrush, and the gentle Dove,"
14126,HER COURTSHIP.,"Woo’d their mates in the boughs above,"
14127,HER COURTSHIP.,"And the Serpent, as yet, only sported."
14128,HER COURTSHIP.,
14129,HER COURTSHIP.,"Who hath not felt that breath in the air,"
14130,HER COURTSHIP.,"A perfume and freshness strange and rare,"
14131,HER COURTSHIP.,"A warmth in the light, and a bliss everywhere,"
14132,HER COURTSHIP.,When young hearts yearn together?
14133,HER COURTSHIP.,"All sweets below, and all sunny above,"
14134,HER COURTSHIP.,"Oh! there’s nothing in life like making love,"
14135,HER COURTSHIP.,Save making hay in fine weather!
14136,HER COURTSHIP.,
14137,HER COURTSHIP.,Who hath not found amongst his flow’rs
14138,HER COURTSHIP.,"A blossom too bright for this world of ours,"
14139,HER COURTSHIP.,Like a rose among snows of Sweden?
14140,HER COURTSHIP.,"But to turn again to Miss Kilmansegg,"
14141,HER COURTSHIP.,"Where must Love have gone to beg,"
14142,HER COURTSHIP.,If such a thing as a Golden Leg
14143,HER COURTSHIP.,Had put its foot in Eden!
14144,HER COURTSHIP.,
14145,HER COURTSHIP.,And yet--to tell the rigid truth--
14146,HER COURTSHIP.,Her favour was sought by Age and Youth--
14147,HER COURTSHIP.,For the prey will find a prowler!
14148,HER COURTSHIP.,"She was follow’d, flatter’d, courted, address’d,"
14149,HER COURTSHIP.,"Woo’d, and coo’d, and wheedled, and press’d,"
14150,HER COURTSHIP.,"By suitors from North, South, East, and West,"
14151,HER COURTSHIP.,"Like that Heiress, in song, Tibbie Fowler!"
14152,HER COURTSHIP.,
14153,HER COURTSHIP.,"But, alas! alas! for the Woman’s fate,"
14154,HER COURTSHIP.,Who has from a mob to choose a mate!
14155,HER COURTSHIP.,’Tis a strange and painful mystery!
14156,HER COURTSHIP.,"But the more the eggs, the worse the hatch;"
14157,HER COURTSHIP.,"The more the fish, the worse the catch;"
14158,HER COURTSHIP.,"The more the sparks, the worse the match;"
14159,HER COURTSHIP.,Is a fact in Woman’s history.
14160,HER COURTSHIP.,
14161,HER COURTSHIP.,"Give her between a brace to pick,"
14162,HER COURTSHIP.,"And mayhap, with luck to help the trick,"
14163,HER COURTSHIP.,"She will take the Faustus, and leave the Old Nick--"
14164,HER COURTSHIP.,"But her future bliss to baffle,"
14165,HER COURTSHIP.,"Amongst a score let her have a voice,"
14166,HER COURTSHIP.,"And she’ll have as little cause to rejoice,"
14167,HER COURTSHIP.,As if she had won the “Man of her choice”
14168,HER COURTSHIP.,In a matrimonial raffle!
14169,HER COURTSHIP.,
14170,HER COURTSHIP.,"Thus, even thus, with the Heiress and Hope,"
14171,HER COURTSHIP.,"Fulfilling the adage of too much rope,"
14172,HER COURTSHIP.,"With so ample a competition,"
14173,HER COURTSHIP.,"She chose the least worthy of all the group,"
14174,HER COURTSHIP.,"Just as the vulture makes a stoop,"
14175,HER COURTSHIP.,And singles out from the herd or troop
14176,HER COURTSHIP.,The beast of the worst condition.
14177,HER COURTSHIP.,
14178,HER COURTSHIP.,"A Foreign Count--who came incog.,"
14179,HER COURTSHIP.,"Not under a cloud, but under a fog,"
14180,HER COURTSHIP.,"In a Calais packet’s fore-cabin,"
14181,HER COURTSHIP.,"To charm some lady British-born,"
14182,HER COURTSHIP.,"With his eyes as black as the fruit of the thorn,"
14183,HER COURTSHIP.,"And his hooky nose, and his beard half-shorn,"
14184,HER COURTSHIP.,Like a half-converted Rabbin.
14185,HER COURTSHIP.,
14186,HER COURTSHIP.,And because the Sex confess a charm
14187,HER COURTSHIP.,"In the man who has slash’d a head or arm,"
14188,HER COURTSHIP.,"Or has been a throat’s undoing,"
14189,HER COURTSHIP.,"He was dress’d like one of the glorious trade,"
14190,HER COURTSHIP.,"At least when Glory is off parade,"
14191,HER COURTSHIP.,"With a stock, and a frock, well trimm’d with braid"
14192,HER COURTSHIP.,And frogs--that went a-wooing.
14193,HER COURTSHIP.,
14194,HER COURTSHIP.,"Moreover, as Counts are apt to do,"
14195,HER COURTSHIP.,"On the left-hand side of his dark surtout,"
14196,HER COURTSHIP.,"At one of those holes that buttons go through,"
14197,HER COURTSHIP.,"(To be a precise recorder,)"
14198,HER COURTSHIP.,"A ribbon he wore, or rather a scrap,"
14199,HER COURTSHIP.,"About an inch of ribbon mayhap,"
14200,HER COURTSHIP.,"That one of his rivals, whimsical chap,"
14201,HER COURTSHIP.,Described as his “Retail Order.”
14202,HER COURTSHIP.,
14203,HER COURTSHIP.,And then--and much it help’d his chance--
14204,HER COURTSHIP.,"He could sing, and play first fiddle, and dance,"
14205,HER COURTSHIP.,"Perform charades, and Proverbs of France--"
14206,HER COURTSHIP.,"Act the tender, and do the cruel;"
14207,HER COURTSHIP.,"For amongst his other killing parts,"
14208,HER COURTSHIP.,"He had broken a brace of female hearts,"
14209,HER COURTSHIP.,And murder’d three men in duel!
14210,HER COURTSHIP.,
14211,HER COURTSHIP.,"Savage at heart, and false of tongue,"
14212,HER COURTSHIP.,"Subtle with age, and smooth to the young,"
14213,HER COURTSHIP.,Like a snake in his coiling and curling--
14214,HER COURTSHIP.,Such was the Count--to give him a niche--
14215,HER COURTSHIP.,"Who came to court that Heiress rich,"
14216,HER COURTSHIP.,And knelt at her foot--one needn’t say which--
14217,HER COURTSHIP.,Besieging her castle of _Sterling_.
14218,HER COURTSHIP.,
14219,HER COURTSHIP.,"With pray’rs and vows he open’d his trench,"
14220,HER COURTSHIP.,"And plied her with English, Spanish, and French,"
14221,HER COURTSHIP.,In phrases the most sentimental:
14222,HER COURTSHIP.,"And quoted poems in High and Low Dutch,"
14223,HER COURTSHIP.,"With now and then an Italian touch,"
14224,HER COURTSHIP.,"Till she yielded, without resisting much,"
14225,HER COURTSHIP.,To homage so continental.
14226,HER COURTSHIP.,
14227,HER COURTSHIP.,And then--the sordid bargain to close--
14228,HER COURTSHIP.,"With a miniature sketch of his hooky nose,"
14229,HER COURTSHIP.,"And his dear dark eyes, as black as sloes,"
14230,HER COURTSHIP.,"And his beard and whiskers as black as those,"
14231,HER COURTSHIP.,The lady’s consent he requited--
14232,HER COURTSHIP.,"And instead of the lock that lovers beg,"
14233,HER COURTSHIP.,The count received from Miss Kilmansegg
14234,HER COURTSHIP.,"A model, in small, of her Precious leg--"
14235,HER COURTSHIP.,And so the couple were plighted!
14236,HER COURTSHIP.,
14237,HER COURTSHIP.,"But, oh! the love that gold must crown!"
14238,HER COURTSHIP.,"Better--better, the love of the clown,"
14239,HER COURTSHIP.,"Who admires his lass in her Sunday gown,"
14240,HER COURTSHIP.,As if all the fairies had dress’d her!
14241,HER COURTSHIP.,"Whose brain to no crooked thought gives birth,"
14242,HER COURTSHIP.,Except that he never will part on earth
14243,HER COURTSHIP.,With his true love’s crooked tester!
14244,HER COURTSHIP.,
14245,HER COURTSHIP.,Alas! for the love that’s linked with gold!
14246,HER COURTSHIP.,Better--better a thousand times told--
14247,HER COURTSHIP.,"More honest, happy, and laudable,"
14248,HER COURTSHIP.,"The downright loving of pretty Cis,"
14249,HER COURTSHIP.,"Who wipes her lips, though there’s nothing amiss,"
14250,HER COURTSHIP.,"And takes a kiss, and gives a kiss,"
14251,HER COURTSHIP.,In which her heart is audible!
14252,HER COURTSHIP.,
14253,HER COURTSHIP.,"Pretty Cis, so smiling and bright,"
14254,HER COURTSHIP.,"Who loves--as she labours--with all her might,"
14255,HER COURTSHIP.,And without any sordid leaven!
14256,HER COURTSHIP.,"Who blushes as red as haws and hips,"
14257,HER COURTSHIP.,"Down to her very finger-tips,"
14258,HER COURTSHIP.,"For Roger’s blue ribbons--to her, like strips"
14259,HER COURTSHIP.,Cut out of the azure of Heaven!
14260,HER COURTSHIP.,
14261,HER COURTSHIP.,
14262,HER MARRIAGE.,HER MARRIAGE.
14263,HER MARRIAGE.,
14264,HER MARRIAGE.,’Twas morn--a most auspicious one!
14265,HER MARRIAGE.,"From the Golden East, the Golden Sun"
14266,HER MARRIAGE.,"Came forth his glorious race to run,"
14267,HER MARRIAGE.,Through clouds of most splendid tinges;
14268,HER MARRIAGE.,"Clouds that lately slept in shade,"
14269,HER MARRIAGE.,But now seem’d made
14270,HER MARRIAGE.,"Of gold brocade,"
14271,HER MARRIAGE.,With magnificent golden fringes.
14272,HER MARRIAGE.,
14273,HER MARRIAGE.,"Gold above, and gold below,"
14274,HER MARRIAGE.,"The earth reflected the golden glow,"
14275,HER MARRIAGE.,"From river, and hill, and valley"
14276,HER MARRIAGE.,"Gilt by the golden light of morn,"
14277,HER MARRIAGE.,"The Thames--it look’d like the Golden Horn,"
14278,HER MARRIAGE.,"And the Barge, that carried coal or corn,"
14279,HER MARRIAGE.,Like Cleopatra’s Galley!
14280,HER MARRIAGE.,
14281,HER MARRIAGE.,"Bright as clusters of Golden-rod,"
14282,HER MARRIAGE.,"Suburban poplars began to nod,"
14283,HER MARRIAGE.,With extempore splendour furnish’d;
14284,HER MARRIAGE.,"While London was bright with glittering clocks,"
14285,HER MARRIAGE.,"Golden dragons, and Golden cocks,"
14286,HER MARRIAGE.,"And above them all,"
14287,HER MARRIAGE.,"The dome of St. Paul,"
14288,HER MARRIAGE.,"With its Golden Cross and its Golden Ball,"
14289,HER MARRIAGE.,Shone out as if newly burnish’d!
14290,HER MARRIAGE.,
14291,HER MARRIAGE.,"And lo! for Golden Hours and Joys,"
14292,HER MARRIAGE.,Troops of glittering Golden Boys
14293,HER MARRIAGE.,"Danced along with a jocund noise,"
14294,HER MARRIAGE.,And their gilded emblems carried!
14295,HER MARRIAGE.,"In short, ’twas the year’s most Golden Day,"
14296,HER MARRIAGE.,"By mortals call’d the First of May,"
14297,HER MARRIAGE.,"When Miss Kilmansegg,"
14298,HER MARRIAGE.,"Of the Golden Leg,"
14299,HER MARRIAGE.,With a Golden Ring was married!
14300,HER MARRIAGE.,
14301,HER MARRIAGE.,"And thousands of children, women, and men,"
14302,HER MARRIAGE.,"Counted the clock from eight till ten,"
14303,HER MARRIAGE.,From St. James’s sonorous steeple;
14304,HER MARRIAGE.,"For next to that interesting job,"
14305,HER MARRIAGE.,"The hanging of Jack, or Bill, or Bob,"
14306,HER MARRIAGE.,There’s nothing so draws a London mob
14307,HER MARRIAGE.,As the noosing of very rich people.
14308,HER MARRIAGE.,
14309,HER MARRIAGE.,And a treat it was for the mob to behold
14310,HER MARRIAGE.,The Bridal Carriage that blazed with gold!
14311,HER MARRIAGE.,"And the Footman tall and the Coachman bold,"
14312,HER MARRIAGE.,In liveries so resplendent--
14313,HER MARRIAGE.,"Coats you wonder’d to see in place,"
14314,HER MARRIAGE.,"They seem’d so rich with golden lace,"
14315,HER MARRIAGE.,That they might have been independent.
14316,HER MARRIAGE.,
14317,HER MARRIAGE.,"Coats, that made those menials proud"
14318,HER MARRIAGE.,"Gaze with scorn on the dingy crowd,"
14319,HER MARRIAGE.,From their gilded elevations:
14320,HER MARRIAGE.,Not to forget that saucy lad
14321,HER MARRIAGE.,"(Ostentation’s favourite cad),"
14322,HER MARRIAGE.,"The Page, who look’d so splendidly clad,"
14323,HER MARRIAGE.,Like a Page of the “Wealth of Nations.”
14324,HER MARRIAGE.,
14325,HER MARRIAGE.,"But the Coachman carried off the state,"
14326,HER MARRIAGE.,With what was a Lancashire body of late
14327,HER MARRIAGE.,Turn’d into a Dresden Figure;
14328,HER MARRIAGE.,"With a bridal Nosegay of early bloom,"
14329,HER MARRIAGE.,"About the size of a birchen broom,"
14330,HER MARRIAGE.,"And so huge a White Favour, had Gog been Groom,"
14331,HER MARRIAGE.,He need not have worn a bigger.
14332,HER MARRIAGE.,
14333,HER MARRIAGE.,And then to see the Groom! the Count!
14334,HER MARRIAGE.,"With Foreign Orders to such an amount,"
14335,HER MARRIAGE.,"And whiskers so wild--nay, bestial;"
14336,HER MARRIAGE.,He seem’d to have borrow’d the shaggy hair
14337,HER MARRIAGE.,"As well as the Stars of the Polar Bear,"
14338,HER MARRIAGE.,To make him look celestial!
14339,HER MARRIAGE.,
14340,HER MARRIAGE.,"And then--Great Jove!--the struggle, the crush,"
14341,HER MARRIAGE.,"The screams, the heaving, the awful rush,"
14342,HER MARRIAGE.,"The swearing, the tearing, the fighting,--"
14343,HER MARRIAGE.,The hats and bonnets smash’d like an egg--
14344,HER MARRIAGE.,"To catch a glimpse of the Golden Leg,"
14345,HER MARRIAGE.,Which between the steps and Miss Kilmansegg
14346,HER MARRIAGE.,Was fully display’d in alighting!
14347,HER MARRIAGE.,
14348,HER MARRIAGE.,From the Golden Ankle up to the Knee
14349,HER MARRIAGE.,There it was for the mob to see!
14350,HER MARRIAGE.,A shocking act had it chanced to be
14351,HER MARRIAGE.,A crooked leg or a skinny:
14352,HER MARRIAGE.,"But although a magnificent veil she wore,"
14353,HER MARRIAGE.,"Such as never was seen before,"
14354,HER MARRIAGE.,"In case of blushes, she blush’d no more"
14355,HER MARRIAGE.,Than George the First on a guinea!
14356,HER MARRIAGE.,
14357,HER MARRIAGE.,"Another step, and lo! she was launched!"
14358,HER MARRIAGE.,"All in white, as Brides are _blanched_"
14359,HER MARRIAGE.,With a wreath of most wonderful splendour--
14360,HER MARRIAGE.,"Diamonds, and pearls, so rich in device,"
14361,HER MARRIAGE.,"That, according to calculation nice,"
14362,HER MARRIAGE.,"Her head was worth as royal a price,"
14363,HER MARRIAGE.,As the head of the Young Pretender.
14364,HER MARRIAGE.,
14365,HER MARRIAGE.,Bravely she shone--and shone the more
14366,HER MARRIAGE.,"As she sail’d through the crowd of squalid and poor,"
14367,HER MARRIAGE.,"Thief, beggar, and tatterdemalion--"
14368,HER MARRIAGE.,"Led by the Count, with his sloe-black eyes"
14369,HER MARRIAGE.,"Bright with triumph, and some surprise,"
14370,HER MARRIAGE.,Like Anson on making sure of his prize
14371,HER MARRIAGE.,The famous Mexican Galleon!
14372,HER MARRIAGE.,
14373,HER MARRIAGE.,"Anon came Lady K., with her face"
14374,HER MARRIAGE.,"Quite made up to act with grace,"
14375,HER MARRIAGE.,But she cut the performance shorter;
14376,HER MARRIAGE.,"For instead of pacing stately and stiff,"
14377,HER MARRIAGE.,"At the stare of the vulgar she took a miff,"
14378,HER MARRIAGE.,"And ran, full speed, into Church, as if"
14379,HER MARRIAGE.,To get married before her daughter.
14380,HER MARRIAGE.,
14381,HER MARRIAGE.,"But Sir Jacob walk’d more slowly, and bow’d"
14382,HER MARRIAGE.,"Right and left to the gaping crowd,"
14383,HER MARRIAGE.,Wherever a glance was seizable:
14384,HER MARRIAGE.,"For Sir Jacob thought he bow’d like a Guelph,"
14385,HER MARRIAGE.,"And therefore bow’d to imp and elf,"
14386,HER MARRIAGE.,"And would gladly have made a bow to himself,"
14387,HER MARRIAGE.,Had such a bow been feasible.
14388,HER MARRIAGE.,
14389,HER MARRIAGE.,"And last--and not the least of the sight,"
14390,HER MARRIAGE.,"Six “Handsome Fortunes,” all in white,"
14391,HER MARRIAGE.,"Came to help in the marriage rite,--"
14392,HER MARRIAGE.,And rehearse their own hymneals;
14393,HER MARRIAGE.,"And then the bright procession to close,"
14394,HER MARRIAGE.,They were followed by just as many Beaux
14395,HER MARRIAGE.,Quite fine enough for Ideals.
14396,HER MARRIAGE.,
14397,HER MARRIAGE.,"Glittering men, and splendid dames,"
14398,HER MARRIAGE.,"Thus they enter’d the porch of St. James’,"
14399,HER MARRIAGE.,Pursued by a thunder of laughter;
14400,HER MARRIAGE.,"For the Beadle was forced to intervene,"
14401,HER MARRIAGE.,"For Jim the Crow, and his Mayday Queen,"
14402,HER MARRIAGE.,"With her gilded ladle, and Jack i’ the Green,"
14403,HER MARRIAGE.,Would fain have follow’d after!
14404,HER MARRIAGE.,
14405,HER MARRIAGE.,Beadle-like he hush’d the shout;
14406,HER MARRIAGE.,"But the temple was full “inside and out,”"
14407,HER MARRIAGE.,And a buzz kept buzzing all round about
14408,HER MARRIAGE.,Like bees when the day is sunny--
14409,HER MARRIAGE.,"A buzz universal, that interfered"
14410,HER MARRIAGE.,"With the right that ought to have been revered,"
14411,HER MARRIAGE.,As if the couple already were smear’d
14412,HER MARRIAGE.,With Wedlock’s treacle and honey!
14413,HER MARRIAGE.,
14414,HER MARRIAGE.,Yet Wedlock’s a very awful thing!
14415,HER MARRIAGE.,"’Tis something like that feat in the ring,"
14416,HER MARRIAGE.,Which requires good nerve to do it--
14417,HER MARRIAGE.,When one of a “Grand Equestrian Troop”
14418,HER MARRIAGE.,"Makes a jump at a gilded hoop,"
14419,HER MARRIAGE.,Not certain at all
14420,HER MARRIAGE.,Of what may befall
14421,HER MARRIAGE.,After his getting through it!
14422,HER MARRIAGE.,
14423,HER MARRIAGE.,But the count he felt the nervous work
14424,HER MARRIAGE.,"No more than any polygamous Turk,"
14425,HER MARRIAGE.,"Or bold piratical skipper,"
14426,HER MARRIAGE.,"Who, during his buccaneering search,"
14427,HER MARRIAGE.,Would as soon engage a hand in church
14428,HER MARRIAGE.,As a hand on board his clipper!
14429,HER MARRIAGE.,
14430,HER MARRIAGE.,And how did the Bride perform her part?
14431,HER MARRIAGE.,"Like any bride who is cold at heart,"
14432,HER MARRIAGE.,Mere snow with the ice’s glitter;
14433,HER MARRIAGE.,What but a life of winter for her!
14434,HER MARRIAGE.,"Bright but chilly, alive without stir,"
14435,HER MARRIAGE.,"So splendidly comfortless,--just like a Fir"
14436,HER MARRIAGE.,When the frost is severe and bitter.
14437,HER MARRIAGE.,
14438,HER MARRIAGE.,Such were the future man and wife!
14439,HER MARRIAGE.,Whose bale or bliss to the end of life
14440,HER MARRIAGE.,A few short words were to settle--
14441,HER MARRIAGE.,“Wilt thou have this woman?”
14442,HER MARRIAGE.,"“I will”--and then,"
14443,HER MARRIAGE.,“Wilt thou have this man?”
14444,HER MARRIAGE.,"“I will,” and “Amen”--"
14445,HER MARRIAGE.,"And those Two were one Flesh, in the Angels’ ken,"
14446,HER MARRIAGE.,Except one Leg--that was metal.
14447,HER MARRIAGE.,
14448,HER MARRIAGE.,Then the names were sign’d--and kiss’d the kiss:
14449,HER MARRIAGE.,"And the Bride, who came from her coach a Miss,"
14450,HER MARRIAGE.,As a Countess walk’d to her carriage--
14451,HER MARRIAGE.,"Whilst Hymen preen’d his plumes like a dove,"
14452,HER MARRIAGE.,"And Cupid flutter’d his wings above,"
14453,HER MARRIAGE.,In the shape of a fly--as little a Love
14454,HER MARRIAGE.,As ever look’d in at a marriage!
14455,HER MARRIAGE.,
14456,HER MARRIAGE.,"Another crash--and away they dash’d,"
14457,HER MARRIAGE.,And the gilded carriage and footman flash’d
14458,HER MARRIAGE.,From the eyes of the gaping people--
14459,HER MARRIAGE.,Who turn’d to gaze at the toe-and-heel
14460,HER MARRIAGE.,"Of the Golden Boys beginning a reel,"
14461,HER MARRIAGE.,To the merry sound of a wedding-peal
14462,HER MARRIAGE.,From St. James’s musical steeple.
14463,HER MARRIAGE.,
14464,HER MARRIAGE.,Those wedding-bells! those wedding-bells!
14465,HER MARRIAGE.,How sweetly they sound in pastoral dells
14466,HER MARRIAGE.,From a tow’r in an ivy-green jacket!
14467,HER MARRIAGE.,But town-made joys how dearly they cost;
14468,HER MARRIAGE.,"And after all are tumbled and tost,"
14469,HER MARRIAGE.,"Like a peal from a London steeple, and lost"
14470,HER MARRIAGE.,In town-made riot and racket.
14471,HER MARRIAGE.,
14472,HER MARRIAGE.,"The wedding-peal, how sweetly it peals"
14473,HER MARRIAGE.,"With grass or heather beneath our heels,--"
14474,HER MARRIAGE.,For bells are Music’s laughter!
14475,HER MARRIAGE.,"But a London peal, well mingled, be sure,"
14476,HER MARRIAGE.,"With vulgar noises and voices impure,--"
14477,HER MARRIAGE.,What a harsh and discordant overture
14478,HER MARRIAGE.,To the Harmony meant to come after!
14479,HER MARRIAGE.,
14480,HER MARRIAGE.,"But hence with Discord--perchance, too soon"
14481,HER MARRIAGE.,To cloud the face of the honeymoon
14482,HER MARRIAGE.,With a dismal occultation!--
14483,HER MARRIAGE.,"Whatever Fate’s concerted trick,"
14484,HER MARRIAGE.,"The Countess and Count, at the present nick,"
14485,HER MARRIAGE.,"Have a chicken, and not a crow, to pick"
14486,HER MARRIAGE.,At a sumptuous Cold Collation.
14487,HER MARRIAGE.,
14488,HER MARRIAGE.,"A Breakfast--no unsubstantial mess,"
14489,HER MARRIAGE.,"But one in the style of Good Queen Bess,"
14490,HER MARRIAGE.,"Who,--hearty as hippocampus,--"
14491,HER MARRIAGE.,"Broke her fast with ale and beef,"
14492,HER MARRIAGE.,"Instead of toast and the Chinese leaf,"
14493,HER MARRIAGE.,And--in lieu of anchovy--grampus.
14494,HER MARRIAGE.,
14495,HER MARRIAGE.,"A breakfast of fowl, and fish, and flesh,"
14496,HER MARRIAGE.,"Whatever was sweet, or salt, or fresh;"
14497,HER MARRIAGE.,With wines the most rare and curious--
14498,HER MARRIAGE.,"Wines, of the richest flavour and hue;"
14499,HER MARRIAGE.,With fruits from the worlds both Old and New;
14500,HER MARRIAGE.,And fruits obtain’d before they were due
14501,HER MARRIAGE.,At a discount most usurious.
14502,HER MARRIAGE.,
14503,HER MARRIAGE.,"For wealthy palates there be, that scout"
14504,HER MARRIAGE.,"What is _in_ season, for what is _out_,"
14505,HER MARRIAGE.,And prefer all precocious savour:
14506,HER MARRIAGE.,"For instance, early green peas, of the sort"
14507,HER MARRIAGE.,That costs some four or five guineas a quart;
14508,HER MARRIAGE.,Where the _Mint_ is the principal flavour.
14509,HER MARRIAGE.,
14510,HER MARRIAGE.,"And many a wealthy man was there,"
14511,HER MARRIAGE.,"Such as the wealthy City could spare,"
14512,HER MARRIAGE.,To put in a portly appearance--
14513,HER MARRIAGE.,"Men, whom their fathers had help’d to gild:"
14514,HER MARRIAGE.,"And men, who had had their fortunes to build,"
14515,HER MARRIAGE.,And--much to their credit--had richly fill’d
14516,HER MARRIAGE.,Their purses by _pursy-verance_.
14517,HER MARRIAGE.,
14518,HER MARRIAGE.,"Men, by popular rumour at least,"
14519,HER MARRIAGE.,Not the last to enjoy a feast!
14520,HER MARRIAGE.,And truly they were not idle!
14521,HER MARRIAGE.,"Luckier far than the chestnut tits,"
14522,HER MARRIAGE.,"Which, down at the door, stood champing their bits,"
14523,HER MARRIAGE.,At a different sort of bridle.
14524,HER MARRIAGE.,
14525,HER MARRIAGE.,For the time was come--and the whisker’d Count
14526,HER MARRIAGE.,"Help’d his Bride in the carriage to mount,"
14527,HER MARRIAGE.,"And fain would the Muse deny it,"
14528,HER MARRIAGE.,"But the crowd, including two butchers in blue,"
14529,HER MARRIAGE.,"(The regular killing Whitechapel hue,)"
14530,HER MARRIAGE.,Of her Precious Calf had as ample a view
14531,HER MARRIAGE.,As if they had come to buy it!
14532,HER MARRIAGE.,
14533,HER MARRIAGE.,Then away! away! with all the speed
14534,HER MARRIAGE.,"That golden spurs can give to the steed,--"
14535,HER MARRIAGE.,"Both Yellow Boys and Guineas, indeed,"
14536,HER MARRIAGE.,Concurr’d to urge the cattle--
14537,HER MARRIAGE.,"Away they went, with favours white,"
14538,HER MARRIAGE.,"Yellow jackets, and panels bright,"
14539,HER MARRIAGE.,"And left the mob, like a mob at night,"
14540,HER MARRIAGE.,Agape at the sound of a rattle.
14541,HER MARRIAGE.,
14542,HER MARRIAGE.,"Away! away! they rattled and roll’d,"
14543,HER MARRIAGE.,"The Count, and his Bride, and her Leg of Gold--"
14544,HER MARRIAGE.,That faded charm to the charmer!
14545,HER MARRIAGE.,"Away, through old Brentford rang the din,"
14546,HER MARRIAGE.,"Of wheels and heels, on their way to win"
14547,HER MARRIAGE.,"That hill, named after one of her kin,"
14548,HER MARRIAGE.,The Hill of the Golden Farmer!
14549,HER MARRIAGE.,
14550,HER MARRIAGE.,"Gold, still gold--it flew like dust!"
14551,HER MARRIAGE.,"It tipp’d the post-boy, and paid the trust;"
14552,HER MARRIAGE.,In each open palm it was freely thrust;
14553,HER MARRIAGE.,There was nothing but giving and taking!
14554,HER MARRIAGE.,"And if gold could ensure the future hour,"
14555,HER MARRIAGE.,"What hopes attended that Bride to her bow’r,"
14556,HER MARRIAGE.,But alas! even hearts with a four-horse pow’r
14557,HER MARRIAGE.,Of opulence end in breaking!
14558,HER MARRIAGE.,
14559,HER MARRIAGE.,
14560,HER HONEYMOON.,HER HONEYMOON.
14561,HER HONEYMOON.,
14562,HER HONEYMOON.,"The moon--the moon, so silver and cold,"
14563,HER HONEYMOON.,"Her fickle temper has oft been told,"
14564,HER HONEYMOON.,Now shady--now bright and sunny--
14565,HER HONEYMOON.,"But of all the lunar things that change,"
14566,HER HONEYMOON.,"The one that shows most fickle and strange,"
14567,HER HONEYMOON.,And takes the most eccentric range
14568,HER HONEYMOON.,Is the moon--so call’d--of honey!
14569,HER HONEYMOON.,
14570,HER HONEYMOON.,"To some a full-grown orb reveal’d,"
14571,HER HONEYMOON.,"As big and as round as Norval’s shield,"
14572,HER HONEYMOON.,And as bright as a burner Bude-lighted;
14573,HER HONEYMOON.,"To others as dull, and dingy, and damp,"
14574,HER HONEYMOON.,"As any oleaginous lamp,"
14575,HER HONEYMOON.,"Of the regular old parochial stamp,"
14576,HER HONEYMOON.,In a London fog benighted.
14577,HER HONEYMOON.,
14578,HER HONEYMOON.,"To the loving, a bright and constant sphere,"
14579,HER HONEYMOON.,That makes earth’s commonest things appear
14580,HER HONEYMOON.,"All poetic, romantic, and tender:"
14581,HER HONEYMOON.,"Hanging with jewels a cabbage-stump,"
14582,HER HONEYMOON.,"And investing a common post, or a pump,"
14583,HER HONEYMOON.,"A currant-bush or a gooseberry-clump,"
14584,HER HONEYMOON.,With a halo of dreamlike splendour.
14585,HER HONEYMOON.,
14586,HER HONEYMOON.,"A sphere such as shone from Italian skies,"
14587,HER HONEYMOON.,"In Juliet’s dear, dark liquid eyes,"
14588,HER HONEYMOON.,"Tipping trees, with its argent braveries--"
14589,HER HONEYMOON.,And to couples not favour’d with Fortune’s boons
14590,HER HONEYMOON.,"One of the most delightful of moons,"
14591,HER HONEYMOON.,For it brightens their pewter platters and spoons
14592,HER HONEYMOON.,Like a silver service of Savory’s!
14593,HER HONEYMOON.,
14594,HER HONEYMOON.,"For all is bright, and beauteous, and clear,"
14595,HER HONEYMOON.,And the meanest thing most precious and dear
14596,HER HONEYMOON.,When the magic of love is present:
14597,HER HONEYMOON.,"Love, that lends a sweetness and grace,"
14598,HER HONEYMOON.,To the humblest spot and the plainest face--
14599,HER HONEYMOON.,"That turns Wilderness Row into Paradise Place,"
14600,HER HONEYMOON.,And Garlic Hill to Mount Pleasant!
14601,HER HONEYMOON.,
14602,HER HONEYMOON.,"Love that sweetens sugarless tea,"
14603,HER HONEYMOON.,And makes contentment and joy agree
14604,HER HONEYMOON.,With the coarsest boarding and bedding:
14605,HER HONEYMOON.,"Love, that no golden ties can attach,"
14606,HER HONEYMOON.,"But nestles under the humblest thatch,"
14607,HER HONEYMOON.,And will fly away from an Emperor’s match
14608,HER HONEYMOON.,To dance at a Penny Wedding!
14609,HER HONEYMOON.,
14610,HER HONEYMOON.,"Oh, happy, happy, thrice happy state,"
14611,HER HONEYMOON.,When such a bright Planet governs the fate
14612,HER HONEYMOON.,Of a pair of united lovers!
14613,HER HONEYMOON.,"’Tis theirs, in spite of the Serpent’s hiss,"
14614,HER HONEYMOON.,"To enjoy the pure primeval kiss,"
14615,HER HONEYMOON.,With as much of the old original bliss
14616,HER HONEYMOON.,As mortality ever recovers!
14617,HER HONEYMOON.,
14618,HER HONEYMOON.,"There’s strength in double joints, no doubt,"
14619,HER HONEYMOON.,"In double X Ale, and Dublin Stout,"
14620,HER HONEYMOON.,That the single sorts know nothing about--
14621,HER HONEYMOON.,And the fist is strongest when doubled--
14622,HER HONEYMOON.,"And double aqua-fortis of course,"
14623,HER HONEYMOON.,"And double soda-water, perforce,"
14624,HER HONEYMOON.,Are the strongest that ever bubbled!
14625,HER HONEYMOON.,
14626,HER HONEYMOON.,There’s double beauty whenever a Swan
14627,HER HONEYMOON.,Swims on a Lake with a double thereon;
14628,HER HONEYMOON.,"And ask the gardener, Luke or John,"
14629,HER HONEYMOON.,Of the beauty of double-blowing--
14630,HER HONEYMOON.,A double dahlia delights the eye;
14631,HER HONEYMOON.,And it’s far the loveliest sight in the sky
14632,HER HONEYMOON.,When a double rainbow is glowing!
14633,HER HONEYMOON.,
14634,HER HONEYMOON.,There’s warmth in a pair of double soles;
14635,HER HONEYMOON.,As well as a double allowance of coals--
14636,HER HONEYMOON.,In a coat that is double-breasted--
14637,HER HONEYMOON.,In double windows and double doors;
14638,HER HONEYMOON.,And a double U wind is blest by scores
14639,HER HONEYMOON.,For its warmth to the tender-chested.
14640,HER HONEYMOON.,
14641,HER HONEYMOON.,There’s a twofold sweetness in double pipes;
14642,HER HONEYMOON.,And a double barrel and double snipes
14643,HER HONEYMOON.,Give the sportsman a duplicate pleasure:
14644,HER HONEYMOON.,There’s double safety in double locks;
14645,HER HONEYMOON.,And double letters bring cash for the box;
14646,HER HONEYMOON.,And all the world knows that double knocks
14647,HER HONEYMOON.,Are gentility’s double measure.
14648,HER HONEYMOON.,
14649,HER HONEYMOON.,"There’s double sweetness in double rhymes,"
14650,HER HONEYMOON.,And a double at Whist and a double Times
14651,HER HONEYMOON.,In profit are certainly double--
14652,HER HONEYMOON.,"By doubling, the Hare contrives to escape;"
14653,HER HONEYMOON.,"And all seamen delight in a doubled Cape,"
14654,HER HONEYMOON.,And a double-reef’d topsail in trouble.
14655,HER HONEYMOON.,
14656,HER HONEYMOON.,"There’s a double chuck at a double chin,"
14657,HER HONEYMOON.,"And of course there’s a double pleasure therein,"
14658,HER HONEYMOON.,If the parties were brought to telling:
14659,HER HONEYMOON.,"And however our Dennises take offence,"
14660,HER HONEYMOON.,A double meaning shows double sense;
14661,HER HONEYMOON.,"And if proverbs tell truth,"
14662,HER HONEYMOON.,A double tooth
14663,HER HONEYMOON.,Is Wisdom’s adopted dwelling!
14664,HER HONEYMOON.,
14665,HER HONEYMOON.,"But double wisdom, and pleasure, and sense,"
14666,HER HONEYMOON.,"Beauty, respect, strength, comfort and thence"
14667,HER HONEYMOON.,"Through whatever the list discovers,"
14668,HER HONEYMOON.,"They are all in the double blessedness summ’d,"
14669,HER HONEYMOON.,"Of what was formerly double-drumm’d,"
14670,HER HONEYMOON.,The Marriage of two true Lovers!
14671,HER HONEYMOON.,
14672,HER HONEYMOON.,"Now the Kilmansegg Moon, it must be told--"
14673,HER HONEYMOON.,Though instead of silver it tipp’d with gold--
14674,HER HONEYMOON.,"Shone rather wan, and distant, and cold,"
14675,HER HONEYMOON.,"And before its days were at thirty,"
14676,HER HONEYMOON.,"Such gloomy clouds began to collect,"
14677,HER HONEYMOON.,"With an ominous ring of ill effect,"
14678,HER HONEYMOON.,As gave but too much cause to expect
14679,HER HONEYMOON.,Such weather as seamen call dirty!
14680,HER HONEYMOON.,
14681,HER HONEYMOON.,"And yet the moon was the “Young May Moon,”"
14682,HER HONEYMOON.,"And the scented hawthorn had blossom’d soon,"
14683,HER HONEYMOON.,And the thrush and the blackbird were singing--
14684,HER HONEYMOON.,"The snow-white lambs were skipping in play,"
14685,HER HONEYMOON.,And the bee was humming a tune all day
14686,HER HONEYMOON.,"To flowers, as welcome as flowers in May,"
14687,HER HONEYMOON.,And the trout in the stream was springing!
14688,HER HONEYMOON.,
14689,HER HONEYMOON.,"But what were the hues of the blooming earth,"
14690,HER HONEYMOON.,Its scents--its sounds--or the music and mirth
14691,HER HONEYMOON.,"Of its furr’d or its feather’d creatures,"
14692,HER HONEYMOON.,"To a Pair in the world’s last sordid stage,"
14693,HER HONEYMOON.,"Who had never look’d into Nature’s page,"
14694,HER HONEYMOON.,"And had strange ideas of a Golden Age,"
14695,HER HONEYMOON.,Without any Arcadian features?
14696,HER HONEYMOON.,
14697,HER HONEYMOON.,And what were joys of the pastoral kind
14698,HER HONEYMOON.,To a Bride--town-made--with a heart and a mind
14699,HER HONEYMOON.,With simplicity ever at battle?
14700,HER HONEYMOON.,"A bride of an ostentatious race,"
14701,HER HONEYMOON.,"Who, thrown in the Golden Farmer’s place,"
14702,HER HONEYMOON.,"Would have trimm’d her shepherds with golden lace,"
14703,HER HONEYMOON.,And gilt the horns of her cattle.
14704,HER HONEYMOON.,
14705,HER HONEYMOON.,"She could not please the pigs with her whim,"
14706,HER HONEYMOON.,And the sheep wouldn’t cast their eyes at a limb
14707,HER HONEYMOON.,For which she had been such a martyr:
14708,HER HONEYMOON.,"The deer in the park, and the colts at grass,"
14709,HER HONEYMOON.,And the cows unheeded let it pass;
14710,HER HONEYMOON.,"And the ass on the common was such an ass,"
14711,HER HONEYMOON.,That he wouldn’t have swapp’d
14712,HER HONEYMOON.,The thistle he cropp’d
14713,HER HONEYMOON.,"For her Leg, including the Garter!"
14714,HER HONEYMOON.,
14715,HER HONEYMOON.,She hated lanes and she hated fields--
14716,HER HONEYMOON.,She hated all that the country yields--
14717,HER HONEYMOON.,And barely knew turnips from clover;
14718,HER HONEYMOON.,"She hated walking in any shape,"
14719,HER HONEYMOON.,"And a country stile was an awkward scrape,"
14720,HER HONEYMOON.,Without the bribe of a mob to gape
14721,HER HONEYMOON.,At the Leg in clambering over!
14722,HER HONEYMOON.,
14723,HER HONEYMOON.,"O blessed nature, “O rus! O rus!”"
14724,HER HONEYMOON.,"Who cannot sigh for the country thus,"
14725,HER HONEYMOON.,Absorb’d in a worldly torpor--
14726,HER HONEYMOON.,"Who does not yearn for its meadow-sweet breath,"
14727,HER HONEYMOON.,"Untainted by care, and crime, and death,"
14728,HER HONEYMOON.,And to stand sometimes upon grass or heath--
14729,HER HONEYMOON.,"That soul, spite of gold, is a pauper!"
14730,HER HONEYMOON.,
14731,HER HONEYMOON.,"But to hail the pearly advent of morn,"
14732,HER HONEYMOON.,"And relish the odour fresh from the thorn,"
14733,HER HONEYMOON.,"She was far too pamper’d a madam,"
14734,HER HONEYMOON.,"Or to joy in the daylight waxing strong,"
14735,HER HONEYMOON.,"While, after ages of sorrow and wrong,"
14736,HER HONEYMOON.,"The scorn of the proud, the misrule of the strong,"
14737,HER HONEYMOON.,"And all the woes that to man belong,"
14738,HER HONEYMOON.,The Lark still carols the self-same song
14739,HER HONEYMOON.,That he did to the uncurst Adam!
14740,HER HONEYMOON.,
14741,HER HONEYMOON.,The Lark! she had given all Leipsic’s flocks
14742,HER HONEYMOON.,For a Vauxhall tune in a musical box;
14743,HER HONEYMOON.,"And as for the birds in the thicket,"
14744,HER HONEYMOON.,"Thrush or ousel in leafy niche,"
14745,HER HONEYMOON.,"The linnet or finch, she was far too rich"
14746,HER HONEYMOON.,"To care for a Morning Concert, to which"
14747,HER HONEYMOON.,She was welcome without any ticket.
14748,HER HONEYMOON.,
14749,HER HONEYMOON.,"Gold, still gold, her standard of old,"
14750,HER HONEYMOON.,"All pastoral joys were tried by gold,"
14751,HER HONEYMOON.,Or by fancies golden and crural--
14752,HER HONEYMOON.,"Till ere she had pass’d one week unblest,"
14753,HER HONEYMOON.,"As her agricultural Uncle’s guest,"
14754,HER HONEYMOON.,"Her mind was made up, and fully imprest,"
14755,HER HONEYMOON.,That felicity could not be rural!
14756,HER HONEYMOON.,
14757,HER HONEYMOON.,And the Count?--to the snow-white lambs at play
14758,HER HONEYMOON.,"And all the scents and the sights of May,"
14759,HER HONEYMOON.,"And the birds that warbled their passion,"
14760,HER HONEYMOON.,"His ears and dark eyes, and decided nose,"
14761,HER HONEYMOON.,Were as deaf and as blind and as dull as those
14762,HER HONEYMOON.,"That overlooked the Bouquet de Rose,"
14763,HER HONEYMOON.,"The Huille Antique,"
14764,HER HONEYMOON.,"And Parfum Unique,"
14765,HER HONEYMOON.,In a Barber’s Temple of Fashion.
14766,HER HONEYMOON.,
14767,HER HONEYMOON.,"To tell, indeed, the true extent"
14768,HER HONEYMOON.,Of his rural bias so far it went
14769,HER HONEYMOON.,As to covet estates in ring fences--
14770,HER HONEYMOON.,And for rural lore he had learn’d in town
14771,HER HONEYMOON.,"That the country was green, turn’d up with brown,"
14772,HER HONEYMOON.,And garnish’d with trees that a man might cut down
14773,HER HONEYMOON.,Instead of his own expenses.
14774,HER HONEYMOON.,
14775,HER HONEYMOON.,"And yet had that fault been his only one,"
14776,HER HONEYMOON.,"The Pair might have had few quarrels or none,"
14777,HER HONEYMOON.,For their tastes thus far were in common;
14778,HER HONEYMOON.,But faults he had that a haughty bride
14779,HER HONEYMOON.,With a Golden Leg could hardly abide--
14780,HER HONEYMOON.,Faults that would even have roused the pride
14781,HER HONEYMOON.,Of a far less metalsome woman!
14782,HER HONEYMOON.,
14783,HER HONEYMOON.,"It was early days indeed for a wife,"
14784,HER HONEYMOON.,"In the very spring of her married life,"
14785,HER HONEYMOON.,To be chill’d by its wintry weather--
14786,HER HONEYMOON.,"But instead of sitting as Love-Birds do,"
14787,HER HONEYMOON.,On Hymen’s turtles that bill and coo--
14788,HER HONEYMOON.,Enjoying their “moon and honey for two”
14789,HER HONEYMOON.,They were scarcely seen together!
14790,HER HONEYMOON.,
14791,HER HONEYMOON.,In vain she sat with her Precious Leg
14792,HER HONEYMOON.,"A little exposed, _à la_ Kilmansegg,"
14793,HER HONEYMOON.,And roll’d her eyes in their sockets!
14794,HER HONEYMOON.,"He left her in spite of her tender regards,"
14795,HER HONEYMOON.,"And those loving murmurs described by bards,"
14796,HER HONEYMOON.,"For the rattling of dice and the shuffling of cards,"
14797,HER HONEYMOON.,And the poking of balls into pockets!
14798,HER HONEYMOON.,
14799,HER HONEYMOON.,Moreover he loved the deepest stake
14800,HER HONEYMOON.,And the heaviest bets the players would make;
14801,HER HONEYMOON.,"And he drank--the reverse of sparely,--"
14802,HER HONEYMOON.,And he used strange curses that made her fret;
14803,HER HONEYMOON.,"And when he played with herself at piquet,"
14804,HER HONEYMOON.,"She found, to her cost,"
14805,HER HONEYMOON.,"For she always lost,"
14806,HER HONEYMOON.,That the Count did not count quite fairly.
14807,HER HONEYMOON.,
14808,HER HONEYMOON.,"And then came dark mistrust and doubt,"
14809,HER HONEYMOON.,"Gather’d by worming his secrets out,"
14810,HER HONEYMOON.,And slips in his conversations--
14811,HER HONEYMOON.,"Fears, which all her peace destroy’d,"
14812,HER HONEYMOON.,That his title was null--his coffers were void--
14813,HER HONEYMOON.,"And his French Château was in Spain, or enjoy’d"
14814,HER HONEYMOON.,The most airy of situations.
14815,HER HONEYMOON.,
14816,HER HONEYMOON.,But still his heart--if he had such a part--
14817,HER HONEYMOON.,"She--only she--might possess his heart,"
14818,HER HONEYMOON.,And hold his affections in fetters--
14819,HER HONEYMOON.,"Alas! that hope, like a crazy ship,"
14820,HER HONEYMOON.,Was forced its anchor and cable to slip
14821,HER HONEYMOON.,"When, seduced by her fears, she took a dip"
14822,HER HONEYMOON.,In his private papers and letters.
14823,HER HONEYMOON.,
14824,HER HONEYMOON.,Letters that told of dangerous leagues;
14825,HER HONEYMOON.,And notes that hinted as many intrigues
14826,HER HONEYMOON.,As the Count’s in the “Barber of Seville”--
14827,HER HONEYMOON.,"In short such mysteries came to light,"
14828,HER HONEYMOON.,"That the Countess-Bride, on the thirtieth night,"
14829,HER HONEYMOON.,"Woke and started up in affright,"
14830,HER HONEYMOON.,"And kick’d and scream’d with all her might,"
14831,HER HONEYMOON.,"And finally fainted away outright,"
14832,HER HONEYMOON.,For she dreamt she had married the Devil!
14833,HER HONEYMOON.,
14834,HER HONEYMOON.,
14835,HER MISERY.,HER MISERY.
14836,HER MISERY.,
14837,HER MISERY.,"Who hath not met with home-made bread,"
14838,HER MISERY.,A heavy compound of putty and lead--
14839,HER MISERY.,"And home-made wines that rack the head,"
14840,HER MISERY.,And home-made liqueurs and waters?
14841,HER MISERY.,"Home-made pop that will not foam,"
14842,HER MISERY.,"And home-made dishes that drive one from home,"
14843,HER MISERY.,"Not to name each mess,"
14844,HER MISERY.,"For the face or dress,"
14845,HER MISERY.,Home-made by the homely daughters?
14846,HER MISERY.,
14847,HER MISERY.,Home-made physic that sickens the sick;
14848,HER MISERY.,Thick for thin and thin for thick;
14849,HER MISERY.,In short each homogeneous trick
14850,HER MISERY.,For poisoning domesticity?
14851,HER MISERY.,"And since our Parents, call’d the First,"
14852,HER MISERY.,"A little family squabble nurst,"
14853,HER MISERY.,Of all our evils the worst of the worst
14854,HER MISERY.,Is home-made infelicity.
14855,HER MISERY.,
14856,HER MISERY.,"There’s a Golden Bird that claps its wings,"
14857,HER MISERY.,"And dances for joy on its perch, and sings"
14858,HER MISERY.,With a Persian exultation:
14859,HER MISERY.,"For the Sun is shining into the room,"
14860,HER MISERY.,"And brightens up the carpet-bloom,"
14861,HER MISERY.,"As if it were new, bran new, from the loom,"
14862,HER MISERY.,Or the lone Nun’s fabrication.
14863,HER MISERY.,
14864,HER MISERY.,And thence the glorious radiance flames
14865,HER MISERY.,On pictures in massy gilded frames--
14866,HER MISERY.,"Enshrining, however, no painted Dames,"
14867,HER MISERY.,But portraits of colts and fillies--
14868,HER MISERY.,"Pictures hanging on walls, which shine,"
14869,HER MISERY.,"In spite of the bard’s familiar line,"
14870,HER MISERY.,With clusters of “Gilded lilies.”
14871,HER MISERY.,
14872,HER MISERY.,And still the flooding sunlight shares
14873,HER MISERY.,"Its lustre with gilded sofas and chairs,"
14874,HER MISERY.,That shine as if freshly burnish’d--
14875,HER MISERY.,"And gilded tables, with glittering stocks"
14876,HER MISERY.,"Of gilded china, and golden clocks,"
14877,HER MISERY.,"Toy, and trinket, and musical box,"
14878,HER MISERY.,That Peace and Paris have furnish’d.
14879,HER MISERY.,
14880,HER MISERY.,And lo! with the brightest gleam of all
14881,HER MISERY.,The glowing sunbeam is seen to fall
14882,HER MISERY.,On an object as rare as splendid--
14883,HER MISERY.,The golden foot of the Golden Leg
14884,HER MISERY.,Of the Countess--once Miss Kilmansegg--
14885,HER MISERY.,But there all sunshine is ended.
14886,HER MISERY.,
14887,HER MISERY.,"Her cheek is pale, and her eye is dim,"
14888,HER MISERY.,"And downward cast, yet not at the limb,"
14889,HER MISERY.,Once the centre of all speculation;
14890,HER MISERY.,"But downward drooping in comfort’s dearth,"
14891,HER MISERY.,As gloomy thoughts are drawn to the earth--
14892,HER MISERY.,Whence human sorrows derive their birth--
14893,HER MISERY.,By a moral gravitation.
14894,HER MISERY.,
14895,HER MISERY.,"Her golden hair is out of its braids,"
14896,HER MISERY.,And her sighs betray the gloomy shades
14897,HER MISERY.,That her evil planet revolves in--
14898,HER MISERY.,And tears are falling that catch a gleam
14899,HER MISERY.,"So bright as they drop in the sunny beam,"
14900,HER MISERY.,"That tears of _aqua regia_ they seem,"
14901,HER MISERY.,The water that gold dissolves in;
14902,HER MISERY.,
14903,HER MISERY.,"Yet, not filial grief were shed"
14904,HER MISERY.,Those tears for a mother’s insanity;
14905,HER MISERY.,"Nor yet because her father was dead,"
14906,HER MISERY.,For the bowing Sir Jacob had bow’d his head
14907,HER MISERY.,To Death--with his usual urbanity;
14908,HER MISERY.,The waters that down her visage rill’d
14909,HER MISERY.,Were drops of unrectified spirit distill’d
14910,HER MISERY.,From the limbeck of Pride and Vanity.
14911,HER MISERY.,
14912,HER MISERY.,"Tears that fell alone and uncheckt,"
14913,HER MISERY.,"Without relief, and without respect,"
14914,HER MISERY.,"Like the fabled pearls that the pigs neglect,"
14915,HER MISERY.,When pigs have that opportunity--
14916,HER MISERY.,"And of all the griefs that mortals share,"
14917,HER MISERY.,The one that seems the hardest to bear
14918,HER MISERY.,Is the grief without community.
14919,HER MISERY.,
14920,HER MISERY.,How bless’d the heart that has a friend
14921,HER MISERY.,A sympathising ear to lend
14922,HER MISERY.,To troubles too great to smother!
14923,HER MISERY.,"For as ale and porter, when flat, are restored"
14924,HER MISERY.,"Till a sparkling bubbling head they afford,"
14925,HER MISERY.,So sorrow is cheer’d by being pour’d
14926,HER MISERY.,From one vessel into another.
14927,HER MISERY.,
14928,HER MISERY.,But friend or gossip she had not one
14929,HER MISERY.,"To hear the vile deeds that the Count had done,"
14930,HER MISERY.,How night after night he rambled;
14931,HER MISERY.,And how she had learnt by sad degrees
14932,HER MISERY.,"That he drank, and smoked, and worse than these,"
14933,HER MISERY.,"That he “swindled, intrigued, and gambled.”"
14934,HER MISERY.,
14935,HER MISERY.,"How he kiss’d the maids, and sparr’d with John!"
14936,HER MISERY.,And came to bed with his garments on;
14937,HER MISERY.,With other offences as heinous--
14938,HER MISERY.,"And brought _strange_ gentlemen home to dine,"
14939,HER MISERY.,"That he said were in the Fancy Line,"
14940,HER MISERY.,"And they fancied spirits instead of wine,"
14941,HER MISERY.,And call’d her lap-dog “Wenus.”
14942,HER MISERY.,
14943,HER MISERY.,Of “making a book” how he made a stir
14944,HER MISERY.,"But never had written a line to her,"
14945,HER MISERY.,Once his idol and Cara Sposa;
14946,HER MISERY.,"And how he had storm’d, and treated her ill,"
14947,HER MISERY.,"Because she refused to go down to a mill,"
14948,HER MISERY.,"She didn’t know where, but remember’d still"
14949,HER MISERY.,That the Miller’s name was Mendoza.
14950,HER MISERY.,
14951,HER MISERY.,"How often he waked her up at night,"
14952,HER MISERY.,"And oftener still by the morning light,"
14953,HER MISERY.,Reeling home from his haunts unlawful;
14954,HER MISERY.,"Singing songs that shouldn’t be sung,"
14955,HER MISERY.,Except by beggars and thieves unhung--
14956,HER MISERY.,Or volleying oaths that a foreign tongue
14957,HER MISERY.,Made still more horrid and awful!
14958,HER MISERY.,
14959,HER MISERY.,"How oft, instead of otto of rose,"
14960,HER MISERY.,"With vulgar smells he offended her nose,"
14961,HER MISERY.,"From gin, tobacco, and onion!"
14962,HER MISERY.,And then how wildly he used to stare!
14963,HER MISERY.,"And shake his fist at nothing, and swear,--"
14964,HER MISERY.,"And pluck by the handful his shaggy hair,"
14965,HER MISERY.,Till he look’d like a study of Giant Despair
14966,HER MISERY.,For a new Edition of Bunyan!
14967,HER MISERY.,
14968,HER MISERY.,"For dice will run the contrary way,"
14969,HER MISERY.,"As well is known to all who play,"
14970,HER MISERY.,And cards will conspire as in treason;
14971,HER MISERY.,"And what with keeping a hunting-box,"
14972,HER MISERY.,Following fox--
14973,HER MISERY.,"Friends in flocks,"
14974,HER MISERY.,"Burgundies, Hocks,"
14975,HER MISERY.,From London Docks;
14976,HER MISERY.,"Stultz’s frocks,"
14977,HER MISERY.,Manton and Nock’s
14978,HER MISERY.,"Barrels and locks,"
14979,HER MISERY.,"Shooting blue rocks,"
14980,HER MISERY.,"Trainers and jocks,"
14981,HER MISERY.,"Buskins and socks,"
14982,HER MISERY.,"Pugilistical knocks,"
14983,HER MISERY.,"And fighting cocks,"
14984,HER MISERY.,If he found himself short in funds and stocks
14985,HER MISERY.,These rhymes will furnish the reason!
14986,HER MISERY.,
14987,HER MISERY.,"His friends, indeed, were falling away--"
14988,HER MISERY.,Friends who insist on play or pay--
14989,HER MISERY.,And he fear’d at no very distant day
14990,HER MISERY.,"To be cut by Lord and by cadger,"
14991,HER MISERY.,"As one, who has gone, or is going, to smash,"
14992,HER MISERY.,"For his checks no longer drew the cash,"
14993,HER MISERY.,"Because, as his comrades explain’d in flash,"
14994,HER MISERY.,“He had overdrawn his badger.”
14995,HER MISERY.,
14996,HER MISERY.,"Gold, gold--alas! for the gold"
14997,HER MISERY.,"Spent where souls are bought and sold,"
14998,HER MISERY.,In Vice’s Walpurgis revel!
14999,HER MISERY.,"Alas! for muffles, and bulldogs, and guns,"
15000,HER MISERY.,"The leg that walks, and the leg that runs,--"
15001,HER MISERY.,"All real evils, though Fancy ones,"
15002,HER MISERY.,"When they lead to debt, dishonour, and duns,"
15003,HER MISERY.,"Nay, to death, and perchance the devil!"
15004,HER MISERY.,
15005,HER MISERY.,Alas! for the last of a Golden race!
15006,HER MISERY.,"Had she cried her wrongs in the market-place,"
15007,HER MISERY.,She had warrant for all her clamour--
15008,HER MISERY.,"For the worst of rogues, and brutes, and rakes,"
15009,HER MISERY.,"Was breaking her heart by constant aches,"
15010,HER MISERY.,"With as little remorse as the Pauper, who breaks"
15011,HER MISERY.,A flint with a parish hammer!
15012,HER MISERY.,
15013,HER MISERY.,
15014,HER LAST WILL.,HER LAST WILL.
15015,HER LAST WILL.,
15016,HER LAST WILL.,"Now the Precious Leg while cash was flush,"
15017,HER LAST WILL.,"Or the Count’s acceptance worth a rush,"
15018,HER LAST WILL.,Had never excited dissension;
15019,HER LAST WILL.,"But no sooner the stocks began to fall,"
15020,HER LAST WILL.,"Than, without any ossification at all,"
15021,HER LAST WILL.,The limb became what people call
15022,HER LAST WILL.,A perfect bone of contention.
15023,HER LAST WILL.,
15024,HER LAST WILL.,"For alter’d days brought alter’d ways,"
15025,HER LAST WILL.,"And instead of the complimentary phrase,"
15026,HER LAST WILL.,So current before her bridal--
15027,HER LAST WILL.,"The Countess heard, in language low,"
15028,HER LAST WILL.,"That her Precious Leg was precious slow,"
15029,HER LAST WILL.,"A good ‘un to look at but bad to go,"
15030,HER LAST WILL.,And kept quite a sum lying idle.
15031,HER LAST WILL.,
15032,HER LAST WILL.,"That instead of playing musical airs,"
15033,HER LAST WILL.,Like Colin’s foot in going up-stairs--
15034,HER LAST WILL.,As the wife in the Scottish ballad declares--
15035,HER LAST WILL.,It made an infernal stumping.
15036,HER LAST WILL.,"Whereas a member of cork, or wood,"
15037,HER LAST WILL.,"Would be lighter and cheaper and quite as good,"
15038,HER LAST WILL.,Without the unbearable thumping.
15039,HER LAST WILL.,
15040,HER LAST WILL.,P’rhaps she thought it a decent thing
15041,HER LAST WILL.,"To show her calf to cobbler and king,"
15042,HER LAST WILL.,But nothing could be absurder--
15043,HER LAST WILL.,While none but the crazy would advertise
15044,HER LAST WILL.,"Their gold before their servants’ eyes,"
15045,HER LAST WILL.,"Who of course some night would make it a prize,"
15046,HER LAST WILL.,By a Shocking and Barbarous Murder.
15047,HER LAST WILL.,
15048,HER LAST WILL.,"But spite of hint, and threat, and scoff,"
15049,HER LAST WILL.,The Leg kept its situation.
15050,HER LAST WILL.,"For legs are not to be taken off,"
15051,HER LAST WILL.,By a verbal amputation.
15052,HER LAST WILL.,"And mortals when they take a whim,"
15053,HER LAST WILL.,The greater the folly the stiffer the limb
15054,HER LAST WILL.,That stand upon it or by it--
15055,HER LAST WILL.,"So the Countess, then Miss Kilmansegg,"
15056,HER LAST WILL.,"At her marriage refused to stir a peg,"
15057,HER LAST WILL.,Till the Lawyers had fasten’d on her Leg
15058,HER LAST WILL.,As fast as the Law could tie it.
15059,HER LAST WILL.,
15060,HER LAST WILL.,Firmly then--and more firmly yet--
15061,HER LAST WILL.,"With scorn for scorn, and with threat for threat,"
15062,HER LAST WILL.,The Proud One confronted the Cruel:
15063,HER LAST WILL.,And loud and bitter the quarrel arose
15064,HER LAST WILL.,"Fierce and merciless--one of those,"
15065,HER LAST WILL.,"With spoken daggers, and looks like blows,"
15066,HER LAST WILL.,In all but the bloodshed a duel!
15067,HER LAST WILL.,
15068,HER LAST WILL.,"Rash, and wild, and wretched, and wrong,"
15069,HER LAST WILL.,"Were the works that came from Weak and Strong,"
15070,HER LAST WILL.,"Till madden’d for desperate matters,"
15071,HER LAST WILL.,"Fierce as tigress escaped from her den,"
15072,HER LAST WILL.,"She flew to her desk--’twas open’d--and then,"
15073,HER LAST WILL.,"In the time it takes to try a pen,"
15074,HER LAST WILL.,"Or the clerk to utter his slow Amen,"
15075,HER LAST WILL.,Her Will was in fifty tatters!
15076,HER LAST WILL.,
15077,HER LAST WILL.,"But the Count, instead of curses wild,"
15078,HER LAST WILL.,"Only nodded his head and smiled,"
15079,HER LAST WILL.,As if at the spleen of an angry child;
15080,HER LAST WILL.,But the calm was deceitful and sinister!
15081,HER LAST WILL.,A lull like the lull of the treacherous sea--
15082,HER LAST WILL.,For Hate in that moment had sworn to be
15083,HER LAST WILL.,"The Golden Leg’s sole Legatee,"
15084,HER LAST WILL.,And that very night to administer!
15085,HER LAST WILL.,
15086,HER LAST WILL.,
15087,HER DEATH.,HER DEATH.
15088,HER DEATH.,
15089,HER DEATH.,’Tis a stern and startling thing to think
15090,HER DEATH.,How often mortality stands on the brink
15091,HER DEATH.,Of its grave without any misgiving;
15092,HER DEATH.,"And yet in this slippery world of strife,"
15093,HER DEATH.,"In the stir of human bustle so rife,"
15094,HER DEATH.,There are daily sounds to tell us that Life
15095,HER DEATH.,"Is dying, and Death is living!"
15096,HER DEATH.,
15097,HER DEATH.,"Ay, Beauty the Girl, and Love the Boy,"
15098,HER DEATH.,"Bright as they are with hope and joy,"
15099,HER DEATH.,"How their souls would sadden instanter,"
15100,HER DEATH.,"To remember that one of those wedding bells,"
15101,HER DEATH.,"Which ring so merrily through the dells,"
15102,HER DEATH.,Is the same that knells
15103,HER DEATH.,"Our last farewells,"
15104,HER DEATH.,Only broken into a canter!
15105,HER DEATH.,
15106,HER DEATH.,But breath and blood set doom at nought--
15107,HER DEATH.,"How little the wretched Countess thought,"
15108,HER DEATH.,"When at night she unloosed her sandal,"
15109,HER DEATH.,"That the Fates had woven her burial-cloth,"
15110,HER DEATH.,"And that Death, in the shape of a Death’s Head Moth,"
15111,HER DEATH.,Was fluttering round her candle!
15112,HER DEATH.,
15113,HER DEATH.,"As she look’d at her clock of or-molu,"
15114,HER DEATH.,"For the hours she had gone so wearily through,"
15115,HER DEATH.,At the end of a day of trial--
15116,HER DEATH.,How little she saw in her pride of prime
15117,HER DEATH.,The dart of Death in the Hand of Time--
15118,HER DEATH.,That hand which moved on the dial!
15119,HER DEATH.,
15120,HER DEATH.,"As she went with her taper up the stair,"
15121,HER DEATH.,How little her swollen eye was aware
15122,HER DEATH.,That the Shadow which follow’d was double!
15123,HER DEATH.,"Or when she closed her chamber door,"
15124,HER DEATH.,"It was shutting out, and for evermore,"
15125,HER DEATH.,The world--and its worldly trouble.
15126,HER DEATH.,
15127,HER DEATH.,"Little she dreamt, as she laid aside"
15128,HER DEATH.,Her jewels--after one glance of pride--
15129,HER DEATH.,They were solemn bequests to Vanity--
15130,HER DEATH.,"Or when her robes she began to doff,"
15131,HER DEATH.,That she stood so near to the putting off
15132,HER DEATH.,Of the flesh that clothes humanity.
15133,HER DEATH.,
15134,HER DEATH.,"And when she quench’d the taper’s light,"
15135,HER DEATH.,"How little she thought as the smoke took flight,"
15136,HER DEATH.,That her day was done--and merged in a night
15137,HER DEATH.,Of dreams and duration uncertain--
15138,HER DEATH.,"Or along with her own,"
15139,HER DEATH.,That a Hand of Bone
15140,HER DEATH.,Was closing mortality’s curtain!
15141,HER DEATH.,

15145,HER DEATH.,And enough is the present tense of toil--
15146,HER DEATH.,"For this world is, to all, a stiffish soil--"

15151,HER DEATH.,"And bid its daily cares good-bye,"
15152,HER DEATH.,Along with its daily clothing?
15153,HER DEATH.,Just as the felon condemn’d to die--
15154,HER DEATH.,With a very natural loathing--
15155,HER DEATH.,"Leaving the Sheriff to dream of ropes,"
15156,HER DEATH.,From his gloomy cell in a vision elopes
15157,HER DEATH.,"To a caper on sunny gleams and slopes,"

15165,HER DEATH.,That flash’d a bright
15166,HER DEATH.,And golden light
15167,HER DEATH.,Under lids still red with weeping.
15168,HER DEATH.,
15169,HER DEATH.,The golden doll that she used to hug!
15170,HER DEATH.,"Her coral of gold, and the golden mug!"
15171,HER DEATH.,Her godfather’s golden presents!
15172,HER DEATH.,"The golden service she had at her meals,"
15173,HER DEATH.,"The golden watch, and chain, and seals,"

15175,HER DEATH.,And her golden fishes and pheasants!
15176,HER DEATH.,
15177,HER DEATH.,The golden guineas in silken purse--
15178,HER DEATH.,And the Golden Legends she heard from her nurse
15179,HER DEATH.,Of the Mayor in his gilded carriage--
15180,HER DEATH.,And London streets that were paved with gold--
15181,HER DEATH.,And the Golden Eggs that were laid of old--
15182,HER DEATH.,With each golden thing
15183,HER DEATH.,To the golden ring
15184,HER DEATH.,At her own auriferous Marriage?
15185,HER DEATH.,
15186,HER DEATH.,And still the golden light of the sun
15187,HER DEATH.,"Through her golden dreams appear’d to run,"
15188,HER DEATH.,"Though the night, that roared without, was one"

15193,HER DEATH.,In revenge of her old eclipses.
15194,HER DEATH.,
15195,HER DEATH.,"But vainly, vainly, the thunder fell,"
15196,HER DEATH.,For the soul of the Sleeper was under a spell
15197,HER DEATH.,That time had lately embitter’d--
15198,HER DEATH.,"The Count, as once at her foot he knelt--"
15199,HER DEATH.,"That foot, which now he wanted to melt!"
15200,HER DEATH.,But--hush!--’twas a stir at her pillow she felt--
15201,HER DEATH.,And some object before her glitter’d.
15202,HER DEATH.,
15203,HER DEATH.,’Twas the Golden Leg!--she knew its gleam!
15204,HER DEATH.,"And up she started and tried to scream,--"
15205,HER DEATH.,But ev’n in the moment she started--
15206,HER DEATH.,"Down came the limb with a frightful smash,"
15207,HER DEATH.,"And lost, in the universal flash"
15208,HER DEATH.,"That her eyeballs made at so mortal a crash,"
15209,HER DEATH.,"The Spark, call’d Vital, departed!"

15216,HER DEATH.,In the morning they found her all alone--
15217,HER DEATH.,"Stiff, and bloody, and cold as stone--"
15218,HER DEATH.,"But her Leg, the Golden Leg, was gone,"
15219,HER DEATH.,And the “Golden Bowl was broken!”
15220,HER DEATH.,
15221,HER DEATH.,Gold--still gold! it haunted her yet--
15222,HER DEATH.,At the Golden Lion the Inquest met--
15223,HER DEATH.,Its foreman a carver and gilder--
15224,HER DEATH.,And the Jury debated from twelve till three
15225,HER DEATH.,"What the Verdict ought to be,"
15226,HER DEATH.,"And they brought it in as Felo de Se,"

15437,THE WIDOW.,"If three should come together--why,"
15438,THE WIDOW.,Three widows are good company!
15439,THE WIDOW.,"If four should meet by any chance,"
15440,THE WIDOW.,"Four is a number very nice,"
15441,THE WIDOW.,To have a rubber in a trice--
15442,THE WIDOW.,But five will up and have a dance!
15443,THE WIDOW.,
15444,THE WIDOW.,Poor Mrs. C---- (why should I not
15445,THE WIDOW.,Declare her name!--her name was Cross)
15446,THE WIDOW.,Was one of those the “common lot”
15447,THE WIDOW.,Had left to weep “no common loss;”--
15448,THE WIDOW.,For she had lately buried then
15449,THE WIDOW.,"A man, the “very best of men,”"
15450,THE WIDOW.,"A lingering truth, discover’d first"
15451,THE WIDOW.,Whenever men “are at the worst.”
15452,THE WIDOW.,"To take the measure of her woe,"
15453,THE WIDOW.,It was some dozen inches deep--
15454,THE WIDOW.,"I mean in crape, and hung so low,"
15455,THE WIDOW.,It hid the drops she did _not_ weep:
15456,THE WIDOW.,"In fact, what human life appears,"
15457,THE WIDOW.,It was a perfect “veil of tears.”
15458,THE WIDOW.,Though ever since she lost “her prop
15459,THE WIDOW.,"And stay,”--alas! he wouldn’t stay--"
15460,THE WIDOW.,"She never had a tear to mop,"
15461,THE WIDOW.,"Except one little angry drop,"
15462,THE WIDOW.,"From Passion’s eye, as Moore would say;"
15463,THE WIDOW.,"Because, when Mister Cross took flight,"

15465,THE WIDOW.,He died upon a washing-day!
15466,THE WIDOW.,
15467,THE WIDOW.,"Still Widow Cross went twice a week,"
15468,THE WIDOW.,"As if “to wet a widow’s cheek,”"
15469,THE WIDOW.,"And soothe his grave with sorrow’s gravy,--"
15470,THE WIDOW.,"’Twas nothing but a make-believe,"
15471,THE WIDOW.,She might as well have hoped to grieve
15472,THE WIDOW.,Enough of brine to float a navy;
15473,THE WIDOW.,And yet she often seem’d to raise
15474,THE WIDOW.,A cambric kerchief to her eye--
15475,THE WIDOW.,"A _duster_ ought to be the phrase,"
15476,THE WIDOW.,Its work was all so very dry.
15477,THE WIDOW.,The springs were lock’d that ought to flow--
15478,THE WIDOW.,In England or in widow-woman--
15479,THE WIDOW.,"As those that watch the weather know,"
15480,THE WIDOW.,Such “backward Springs” are not uncommon.
15481,THE WIDOW.,
15482,THE WIDOW.,"But why did Widow Cross take pains,"

15484,THE WIDOW.,"Remains that could not tell a jot,"
15485,THE WIDOW.,"Whether she ever wept or not,"
15486,THE WIDOW.,Or how his relict took her losses?
15487,THE WIDOW.,Oh! my black ink turns red for shame--
15488,THE WIDOW.,"But still the naughty world must learn,"
15489,THE WIDOW.,There was a little German came
15490,THE WIDOW.,"To shed a tear in “Anna’s Urn,”"
15491,THE WIDOW.,At the next grave to Mr. Cross’s!
15492,THE WIDOW.,"For there an angel’s virtues slept,"
15493,THE WIDOW.,“Too soon did Heaven assert its claim!”
15494,THE WIDOW.,"But still her painted face he kept,"
15495,THE WIDOW.,“Encompass’d in an angel’s frame.”
15496,THE WIDOW.,
15497,THE WIDOW.,"He look’d quite sad and quite deprived,"
15498,THE WIDOW.,His head was nothing but a hat-band;
15499,THE WIDOW.,"He look’d so lone, and so _un_wived,"
15500,THE WIDOW.,That soon the Widow Cross contrived
15501,THE WIDOW.,To fall in love with even _that_ band;
15502,THE WIDOW.,And all at once the brackish juices
15503,THE WIDOW.,Came gushing out thro’ sorrow’s sluices--
15504,THE WIDOW.,"Tear after tear too fast to wipe,"
15505,THE WIDOW.,"Tho’ sopp’d, and sopp’d, and sopp’d again--"
15506,THE WIDOW.,"No leak in sorrow’s private pipe,"
15507,THE WIDOW.,But like a bursting on the main!
15508,THE WIDOW.,Whoe’er has watch’d the window-pane--
15509,THE WIDOW.,I mean to say in showery weather--
15510,THE WIDOW.,"Has seen two little drops of rain,"
15511,THE WIDOW.,"Like lovers very fond and fain,"
15512,THE WIDOW.,"At one another creeping, creeping,"
15513,THE WIDOW.,"Till both, at last, embrace together:"
15514,THE WIDOW.,So far’d it with that couple’s weeping!
15515,THE WIDOW.,The principle was quite as active--
15516,THE WIDOW.,"Tear unto tear,"
15517,THE WIDOW.,"Kept drawing near,"
15518,THE WIDOW.,Their very blacks became attractive.
15519,THE WIDOW.,"To cut a shortish story shorter,"
15520,THE WIDOW.,Conceive them sitting tête à tête--
15521,THE WIDOW.,"Two cups,--hot muffins on a plate,--"
15522,THE WIDOW.,With “Anna’s Urn” to hold hot water!
15523,THE WIDOW.,
15524,THE WIDOW.,"The brazen vessel for a while,"
15525,THE WIDOW.,"Had lectured in an easy song,"
15526,THE WIDOW.,Like Abernethy--on the bile--
15527,THE WIDOW.,The scalded herb was getting strong;
15528,THE WIDOW.,"All seem’d as smooth as smooth could be,"
15529,THE WIDOW.,To have a cosey cup of tea;
15530,THE WIDOW.,Alas! how often human sippers
15531,THE WIDOW.,"With unexpected bitters meet,"
15532,THE WIDOW.,"And buds, the sweetest of the sweet,"
15533,THE WIDOW.,"Like sugar, only meet the nippers!"
15534,THE WIDOW.,
15535,THE WIDOW.,"The Widow Cross, I should have told,"
15536,THE WIDOW.,Had seen three husbands to the mould;
15537,THE WIDOW.,"She never sought an Indian pyre,"
15538,THE WIDOW.,"Like Hindoo wives that lose their loves,"
15539,THE WIDOW.,"But with a proper sense of fire,"
15540,THE WIDOW.,"Put up, instead, with “three removes:”"
15541,THE WIDOW.,"Thus, when with any tender words"
15542,THE WIDOW.,"Or tears she spoke about her loss,"
15543,THE WIDOW.,"The dear departed, Mr. Cross,"
15544,THE WIDOW.,Came in for nothing but his thirds;
15545,THE WIDOW.,"For, as all widows love too well,"
15546,THE WIDOW.,"She liked upon the list to dwell,"
15547,THE WIDOW.,And oft ripp’d up the old disasters--
15548,THE WIDOW.,"She might, indeed, have been supposed"
15549,THE WIDOW.,"A great _ship_ owner, for she prosed"
15550,THE WIDOW.,Eternally of her Three Masters!
15551,THE WIDOW.,
15552,THE WIDOW.,"Thus, foolish woman! while she nursed"
15553,THE WIDOW.,"Her mild souchong, she talk’d and reckon’d"
15554,THE WIDOW.,"What had been left her by her first,"
15555,THE WIDOW.,"And by her last, and by her second."
15556,THE WIDOW.,Alas! not all her annual rents
15557,THE WIDOW.,"Could then entice the little German,--"
15558,THE WIDOW.,"Not Mr. Cross’s Three Per Cents,"
15559,THE WIDOW.,"Or Consols, ever make him _her_ man;"
15560,THE WIDOW.,"He liked her cash, he liked her houses,"
15561,THE WIDOW.,But not that dismal bit of land
15562,THE WIDOW.,She always settled on her spouses.
15563,THE WIDOW.,"So taking up his hat and band,"
15564,THE WIDOW.,Said he “You’ll think my conduct odd--

15589,II.,The engines!--I hear them come rumbling;
15590,II.,There’s the Phœnix! the Globe! and the Sun!
15591,II.,"What a row there will be, and a grumbling"
15592,II.,When the water don’t start for a run!
15593,II.,"See! there they come racing and tearing,"
15594,II.,All the street with loud voices is fill’d;
15595,II.,Oh! its only the firemen a-swearing
15596,II.,At a man they’ve run over and kill’d!
15597,II.,
15598,II.,
15599,III.,III.
15600,III.,
15601,III.,"How sweetly the sparks fly away now,"
15602,III.,And twinkle like stars in the sky;
15603,III.,"It’s a wonder the engines don’t play now,"
15604,III.,But I never saw water so shy!
15605,III.,"Why there isn’t enough for a snipe,"
15606,III.,"And the fire is fiercer, alas!"
15607,III.,"Oh! instead of the New River pipe,"
15608,III.,They have gone--that they have--to the gas!

15615,IV.,"My dears, keep fast hold, if you please,"
15616,IV.,And they won’t be an hour with the ladder!
15617,IV.,"But if any one’s hot in their feet,"
15618,IV.,"And in very great haste to be saved,"
15619,IV.,"Here’s a nice easy bit in the street,"
15620,IV.,That M‘Adam has lately unpaved!

15624,V.,
15625,V.,There is some one--I see a dark shape
15626,V.,"At that window, the hottest of all,--"
15627,V.,"My good woman, why don’t you escape?"
15628,V.,Never think of your bonnet and shawl:
15629,V.,"If your dress isn’t perfect, what is it"
15630,V.,For once in a way to your hurt?
15631,V.,When your husband is paying a visit
15632,V.,"There, at Number Fourteen, in his shirt!"
15633,V.,
15634,V.,
15635,VI.,VI.
15636,VI.,
15637,VI.,Only see how she throws out her _chaney!_
15638,VI.,"Her basons, and teapots, and all"
15639,VI.,"The most brittle of _her_ goods--or any,"
15640,VI.,But they all break in breaking their fall:
15641,VI.,Such things are not surely the best
15642,VI.,From a two-story window to throw--
15643,VI.,"She might save a good iron-bound chest,"
15644,VI.,For there’s plenty of people below!
15645,VI.,
15646,VI.,
15647,VII.,VII.
15648,VII.,
15649,VII.,O dear! what a beautiful flash!
15650,VII.,How it shone thro’ the window and door;
15651,VII.,"We shall soon hear a scream and a crash,"
15652,VII.,When the woman falls thro’ with the floor!
15653,VII.,"There! there! what a volley of flame,"
15654,VII.,And then suddenly all is obscured!--
15655,VII.,Well--I’m glad in my heart that I came;--
15656,VII.,But I hope the poor man is insured!

15666,THE WEE MAN.,
15667,A ROMANCE.,A ROMANCE.
15668,A ROMANCE.,
15669,A ROMANCE.,
15670,A ROMANCE.,"It was a merry company,"
15671,A ROMANCE.,"And they were just afloat,"
15672,A ROMANCE.,"When lo! a man, of dwarfish span,"
15673,A ROMANCE.,Came up and hail’d the boat.
15674,A ROMANCE.,
15675,A ROMANCE.,"“Good morrow to ye, gentle folks,"
15676,A ROMANCE.,And will you let me in?--
15677,A ROMANCE.,"A slender space will serve my case,"
15678,A ROMANCE.,For I am small and thin.”
15679,A ROMANCE.,"They saw he was a dwarfish man,"
15680,A ROMANCE.,And very small and thin;
15681,A ROMANCE.,"Not seven such would matter much,"
15682,A ROMANCE.,And so they took him in.
15683,A ROMANCE.,
15684,A ROMANCE.,"They laugh’d to see his little hat,"
15685,A ROMANCE.,With such a narrow brim;
15686,A ROMANCE.,They laugh’d to note his dapper coat
15687,A ROMANCE.,With skirts so scant and trim.
15688,A ROMANCE.,
15689,A ROMANCE.,"But barely had they gone a mile,"
15690,A ROMANCE.,"When, gravely, one and all,"
15691,A ROMANCE.,At once began to think the man
15692,A ROMANCE.,Was not so very small.
15693,A ROMANCE.,
15694,A ROMANCE.,"His coat had got a broader skirt,"
15695,A ROMANCE.,"His hat a broader brim,"
15696,A ROMANCE.,"His leg grew stout, and soon plump’d out"
15697,A ROMANCE.,A very proper limb.
15698,A ROMANCE.,
15699,A ROMANCE.,"Still on they went, and as they went,"
15700,A ROMANCE.,"More rough the billows grew,--"
15701,A ROMANCE.,"And rose and fell, a greater swell,"
15702,A ROMANCE.,And he was swelling too!
15703,A ROMANCE.,
15704,A ROMANCE.,"And lo! where room had been for seven,"
15705,A ROMANCE.,For six there scarce was space!
15706,A ROMANCE.,For five!--for four!--for three!--not more
15707,A ROMANCE.,Than two could find a place!
15708,A ROMANCE.,
15709,A ROMANCE.,There was not even room for one!
15710,A ROMANCE.,They crowded by degrees--
15711,A ROMANCE.,"Aye--closer yet, till elbows met,"
15712,A ROMANCE.,And knees were jogging knees.
15713,A ROMANCE.,
15714,A ROMANCE.,"“Good sir, you must not sit a-stern,"
15715,A ROMANCE.,The wave will else come in!”
15716,A ROMANCE.,"Without a word he gravely stirr’d,"
15717,A ROMANCE.,Another seat to win.
15718,A ROMANCE.,
15719,A ROMANCE.,"“Good sir, the boat has lost her trim,"
15720,A ROMANCE.,You must not sit a-lee!”
15721,A ROMANCE.,"With smiling face, and courteous grace,"
15722,A ROMANCE.,The middle seat took he.
15723,A ROMANCE.,
15724,A ROMANCE.,"But still, by constant quiet growth,"
15725,A ROMANCE.,"His back became so wide,"
15726,A ROMANCE.,"Each neighbour wight, to left and right,"
15727,A ROMANCE.,Was thrust against the side.
15728,A ROMANCE.,
15729,A ROMANCE.,"Lord! how they chided with themselves,"
15730,A ROMANCE.,That they had let him in;
15731,A ROMANCE.,"To see him grow so monstrous now,"
15732,A ROMANCE.,That came so small and thin.
15733,A ROMANCE.,
15734,A ROMANCE.,"On every brow a dew-drop stood,"
15735,A ROMANCE.,"They grew so scared and hot,--"
15736,A ROMANCE.,"“I’ the name of all that’s great and tall,"
15737,A ROMANCE.,"Who are ye, sir, and what?”"
15738,A ROMANCE.,
15739,A ROMANCE.,"Loud laugh’d the Gogmagog, a laugh"
15740,A ROMANCE.,As loud as giant’s roar--
15741,A ROMANCE.,"“When first I came, my proper name"
15742,A ROMANCE.,Was Little--now I’m _Moore_!”

15747,“THE LAST MAN.”,“THE LAST MAN.”
15748,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15749,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15750,“THE LAST MAN.”,"’Twas in the year two thousand and one,"
15751,“THE LAST MAN.”,"A pleasant morning of May,"
15752,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I sat on the gallows-tree all alone,"
15753,“THE LAST MAN.”,"A-chanting a merry lay,--"
15754,“THE LAST MAN.”,"To think how the pest had spared my life,"
15755,“THE LAST MAN.”,To sing with the larks that day!
15756,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15757,“THE LAST MAN.”,"When up the heath came a jolly knave,"
15758,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Like a scarecrow, all in rags:"
15759,“THE LAST MAN.”,It made me crow to see his old duds
15760,“THE LAST MAN.”,"All abroad in the wind, like flags:--"
15761,“THE LAST MAN.”,So up he came to the timbers’ foot
15762,“THE LAST MAN.”,And pitch’d down his greasy bags.--
15763,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15764,“THE LAST MAN.”,Good Lord! how blithe the old beggar was!
15765,“THE LAST MAN.”,"At pulling out his scraps,--"
15766,“THE LAST MAN.”,The very sight of his broken orts
15767,“THE LAST MAN.”,Made a work in his wrinkled chaps:
15768,“THE LAST MAN.”,"“Come down,” says he, “you Newgate-bird,"
15769,“THE LAST MAN.”,And have a taste of my snaps!”----
15770,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15771,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Then down the rope, like a tar from the mast,"
15772,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I slided, and by him stood;"
15773,“THE LAST MAN.”,But I wished myself on the gallows again
15774,“THE LAST MAN.”,"When I smelt that beggar’s food,"
15775,“THE LAST MAN.”,A foul beef-bone and a mouldy crust;
15776,“THE LAST MAN.”,"“Oh!” quoth he, “the heavens are good!”"
15777,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15778,“THE LAST MAN.”,Then after this grace he cast him down:
15779,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Says I, “You’ll get sweeter air"
15780,“THE LAST MAN.”,"A pace or two off, on the windward side,”"
15781,“THE LAST MAN.”,For the felons’ bones lay there.
15782,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But he only laugh’d at the empty skulls,"
15783,“THE LAST MAN.”,And offered them part of his fare.
15784,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15785,“THE LAST MAN.”,"“I never harm’d _them_, and they won’t harm me:"
15786,“THE LAST MAN.”,Let the proud and the rich be cravens!”
15787,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I did not like that strange beggar man,"
15788,“THE LAST MAN.”,He look’d so up at the heavens.
15789,“THE LAST MAN.”,Anon he shook out his empty old poke;
15790,“THE LAST MAN.”,"“There’s the crumbs,” saith he, “for the ravens!”"
15791,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15792,“THE LAST MAN.”,"It made me angry to see his face,"
15793,“THE LAST MAN.”,It had such a jesting look;
15794,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But while I made up my mind to speak,"
15795,“THE LAST MAN.”,A small case-bottle he took:
15796,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Quoth he, “though I gather the green water-cress"
15797,“THE LAST MAN.”,My drink is not of the brook!”
15798,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15799,“THE LAST MAN.”,Full manners-like he tender’d the dram;
15800,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Oh, it came of a dainty cask!"
15801,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But, whenever it came to his turn to pull,"
15802,“THE LAST MAN.”,"“Your leave, good Sir, I must ask;"
15803,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But I always wipe the brim with my sleeve,"
15804,“THE LAST MAN.”,When a hangman sups at my flask!”
15805,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15806,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And then he laugh’d so loudly and long,"
15807,“THE LAST MAN.”,The churl was quite out of breath;
15808,“THE LAST MAN.”,I thought the very Old One was come
15809,“THE LAST MAN.”,"To mock me before my death,"
15810,“THE LAST MAN.”,And wish’d I had buried the dead men’s bones
15811,“THE LAST MAN.”,That were lying about the heath!
15812,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15813,“THE LAST MAN.”,But the beggar gave me a jolly clap--
15814,“THE LAST MAN.”,"“Come, let us pledge each other,"
15815,“THE LAST MAN.”,"For all the wide world is dead beside,"
15816,“THE LAST MAN.”,And we are brother and brother--
15817,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I’ve a yearning for thee in my heart,"
15818,“THE LAST MAN.”,As if we had come of one mother.
15819,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15820,“THE LAST MAN.”,“I’ve a yearning for thee in my heart
15821,“THE LAST MAN.”,"That almost makes me weep,"
15822,“THE LAST MAN.”,For as I pass’d from town to town
15823,“THE LAST MAN.”,"The folks were all stone-asleep,--"
15824,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But when I saw thee sitting aloft,"
15825,“THE LAST MAN.”,It made me both laugh and leap!”
15826,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15827,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Now a curse (I thought) be on his love,"
15828,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And a curse upon his mirth,--"
15829,“THE LAST MAN.”,An’ it were not for that beggar man
15830,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I’d be the King of the earth,--"
15831,“THE LAST MAN.”,But I promis’d myself an hour should come
15832,“THE LAST MAN.”,To make him rue his birth--
15833,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15834,“THE LAST MAN.”,So down we sat and bous’d again
15835,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Till the sun was in mid-sky,"
15836,“THE LAST MAN.”,"When, just as the gentle west-wind came,"
15837,“THE LAST MAN.”,We hearken’d a dismal cry;
15838,“THE LAST MAN.”,"“Up, up, on the tree,” quoth the beggar man,"
15839,“THE LAST MAN.”,“Till these horrible dogs go by!”
15840,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15841,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And, lo! from the forest’s far off skirts,"
15842,“THE LAST MAN.”,"They came all yelling for gore,"
15843,“THE LAST MAN.”,"A hundred hounds pursuing at once,"
15844,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And a panting hart before,"
15845,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Till he sunk adown at the gallows’ foot,"
15846,“THE LAST MAN.”,And there his haunches they tore!
15847,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15848,“THE LAST MAN.”,"His haunches they tore, without a horn"
15849,“THE LAST MAN.”,To tell when the chase was done;
15850,“THE LAST MAN.”,And there was not a single scarlet coat
15851,“THE LAST MAN.”,To flaunt it in the sun!--
15852,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I turn’d, and look’d at the beggar man,"
15853,“THE LAST MAN.”,And his tears dropt one by one!
15854,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15855,“THE LAST MAN.”,And with curses sore he chid at the hounds
15856,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Till the last dropt out of sight,"
15857,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Anon, saith he, “let’s down again,"
15858,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And ramble for our delight,"
15859,“THE LAST MAN.”,"For the world’s all free, and we may choose"
15860,“THE LAST MAN.”,A right cozie barn for to-night!”
15861,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15862,“THE LAST MAN.”,"With that, he set up his staff on end,"
15863,“THE LAST MAN.”,And it fell with the point due West;
15864,“THE LAST MAN.”,"So we far’d that way to a city great,"
15865,“THE LAST MAN.”,Where the folks had died of the pest--
15866,“THE LAST MAN.”,"It was fine to enter in house and hall,"
15867,“THE LAST MAN.”,Wherever it liked me best;
15868,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15869,“THE LAST MAN.”,"For the porters all were stiff and cold,"
15870,“THE LAST MAN.”,And could not lift their heads;
15871,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And when we came where their masters lay,"
15872,“THE LAST MAN.”,The rats leapt out of the beds;
15873,“THE LAST MAN.”,The grandest palaces in the land
15874,“THE LAST MAN.”,Were as free as workhouse sheds.
15875,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15876,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But the beggar man made a mumping face,"
15877,“THE LAST MAN.”,And knock’d at every gate:
15878,“THE LAST MAN.”,"It made me curse to hear how he whin’d,"
15879,“THE LAST MAN.”,"So our fellowship turn’d to hate,"
15880,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And I bade him walk the world by himself,"
15881,“THE LAST MAN.”,For I scorn’d so humble a mate!
15882,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15883,“THE LAST MAN.”,"So _he_ turn’d right and _I_ turn’d left,"
15884,“THE LAST MAN.”,As if we had never met;
15885,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And I chose a fair stone house for myself,"
15886,“THE LAST MAN.”,For the city was all to let;
15887,“THE LAST MAN.”,And for three brave holydays drank my fill
15888,“THE LAST MAN.”,Of the choicest that I could get.
15889,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15890,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And because my jerkin was coarse and worn,"
15891,“THE LAST MAN.”,I got me a properer vest;
15892,“THE LAST MAN.”,"It was purple velvet, stitch’d o’er with gold,"
15893,“THE LAST MAN.”,And a shining star at the breast!--
15894,“THE LAST MAN.”,’Twas enough to fetch old Joan from her grave
15895,“THE LAST MAN.”,To see me so purely drest!--
15896,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15897,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But Joan was dead and under the mould,"
15898,“THE LAST MAN.”,And every buxom lass;
15899,“THE LAST MAN.”,"In vain I watch’d, at the window pane,"
15900,“THE LAST MAN.”,For a Christian soul to pass!
15901,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But sheep and kine wander’d up the street,"
15902,“THE LAST MAN.”,And browz’d on the new-come grass.--
15903,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15904,“THE LAST MAN.”,"When lo! I spied the old beggar man,"
15905,“THE LAST MAN.”,And lustily he did sing!--
15906,“THE LAST MAN.”,"His rags were lapp’d in a scarlet cloak,"
15907,“THE LAST MAN.”,And a crown he had like a King;
15908,“THE LAST MAN.”,So he stept right up before my gate
15909,“THE LAST MAN.”,And danc’d me a saucy fling!
15910,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15911,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Heaven mend us all!--but, within my mind,"
15912,“THE LAST MAN.”,I had kill’d him then and there;
15913,“THE LAST MAN.”,To see him lording so braggart-like
15914,“THE LAST MAN.”,That was born to his beggar’s fare;
15915,“THE LAST MAN.”,And how he had stol’n the royal crown
15916,“THE LAST MAN.”,His betters were meant to wear.
15917,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15918,“THE LAST MAN.”,But God forbid that a thief should die
15919,“THE LAST MAN.”,Without his share of the laws!
15920,“THE LAST MAN.”,"So I nimbly whipt my tackle out,"
15921,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And soon tied up his claws,--"
15922,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I was judge myself, and jury, and all,"
15923,“THE LAST MAN.”,And solemnly tried the cause.
15924,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15925,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But the beggar man would not plead, but cried"
15926,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Like a babe without its corals,"
15927,“THE LAST MAN.”,"For he knew how hard it is apt to go,"
15928,“THE LAST MAN.”,"When the law and a thief have quarrels,--"
15929,“THE LAST MAN.”,There was not a Christian soul alive
15930,“THE LAST MAN.”,To speak a word for his morals.
15931,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15932,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Oh, how gaily I doff’d my costly gear,"
15933,“THE LAST MAN.”,And put on my work-day clothes;
15934,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I was tired of such a long Sunday life,--"
15935,“THE LAST MAN.”,And never was one of the sloths;
15936,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But the beggar man grumbled a weary deal,"
15937,“THE LAST MAN.”,And made many crooked mouths.
15938,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15939,“THE LAST MAN.”,"So I haul’d him off to the gallows’ foot,"
15940,“THE LAST MAN.”,And blinded him in his bags;
15941,“THE LAST MAN.”,"’Twas a weary job to heave him up,"
15942,“THE LAST MAN.”,For a doom’d man always lags;
15943,“THE LAST MAN.”,But by ten of the clock he was off his legs
15944,“THE LAST MAN.”,"In the wind, and airing his rags!"
15945,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15946,“THE LAST MAN.”,"So there he hung, and there I stood,"
15947,“THE LAST MAN.”,"The LAST MAN left alive,"
15948,“THE LAST MAN.”,To have my own will of all the earth:
15949,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Quoth I, now I shall thrive!"
15950,“THE LAST MAN.”,But when was ever honey made
15951,“THE LAST MAN.”,With one bee in a hive!
15952,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15953,“THE LAST MAN.”,"My conscience began to gnaw my heart,"
15954,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Before the day was done,"
15955,“THE LAST MAN.”,"For other men’s lives had all gone out,"
15956,“THE LAST MAN.”,Like candles in the sun!--
15957,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But it seem’d as if I had broke, at last,"
15958,“THE LAST MAN.”,A thousand necks in one!
15959,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15960,“THE LAST MAN.”,So I went and cut his body down
15961,“THE LAST MAN.”,To bury it decentlie;
15962,“THE LAST MAN.”,God send there were any good soul alive
15963,“THE LAST MAN.”,To do the like by me!
15964,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But the wild dogs came with terrible speed,"
15965,“THE LAST MAN.”,And bay’d me up the tree!
15966,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15967,“THE LAST MAN.”,"My sight was like a drunkard’s sight,"
15968,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And my head began to swim,"
15969,“THE LAST MAN.”,"To see their jaws all white with foam,"
15970,“THE LAST MAN.”,Like the ravenous ocean brim;--
15971,“THE LAST MAN.”,But when the wild dogs trotted away
15972,“THE LAST MAN.”,Their jaws were bloody and grim!
15973,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15974,“THE LAST MAN.”,"Their jaws were bloody and grim, good Lord!"
15975,“THE LAST MAN.”,"But the beggar man, where was he?--"
15976,“THE LAST MAN.”,There was nought of him but some ribbons of rags
15977,“THE LAST MAN.”,Below the gallow’s tree!--
15978,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I know the Devil, when I am dead,"
15979,“THE LAST MAN.”,Will send his hounds for me!--
15980,“THE LAST MAN.”,
15981,“THE LAST MAN.”,"I’ve buried my babies one by one,"
15982,“THE LAST MAN.”,"And dug the deep hole for Joan,"

17063,A MOORISH TALE.,
17064,A MOORISH TALE.,Scheherazade immediately began the following story.

17071,A MOORISH TALE.,"Upon the throne of greatness--great indeed,"
17072,A MOORISH TALE.,For those that he had under him were great--
17073,A MOORISH TALE.,"The horse he rode on, shod with silver nails,"
17074,A MOORISH TALE.,Was a Bashaw--Bashaws have horses’ tails.
17075,A MOORISH TALE.,
17076,A MOORISH TALE.,Ali was cruel--a most cruel one!
17077,A MOORISH TALE.,’Tis rumour’d he had strangled his own mother--
17078,A MOORISH TALE.,"Howbeit such deeds of darkness he had done,"
17079,A MOORISH TALE.,’Tis thought he would have slain his elder brother
17080,A MOORISH TALE.,And sister too--but happily that none
17081,A MOORISH TALE.,"Did live within _harm’s_ length of one another,"
17082,A MOORISH TALE.,Else he had sent the Sun in all its blaze
17083,A MOORISH TALE.,"To endless night, and shorten’d the Moon’s days."
17084,A MOORISH TALE.,
17085,A MOORISH TALE.,"Despotic power, that mars a weak man’s wit,"
17086,A MOORISH TALE.,"And makes a bad man--absolutely bad,"
17087,A MOORISH TALE.,Made Ali wicked--to a fault:--’tis fit
17088,A MOORISH TALE.,Monarchs should have some check-strings; but he had
17089,A MOORISH TALE.,No curb upon his will--no not a _bit_--
17090,A MOORISH TALE.,Wherefore he did not reign well--and full glad
17091,A MOORISH TALE.,"His slaves had been to hang him--but they falter’d,"
17092,A MOORISH TALE.,"And let him live unhang’d--and still unalter’d,"

17100,A MOORISH TALE.,But yet not so poetic as when Time

17108,A MOORISH TALE.,"When he was gone--doom’d, when his days were done,"
17109,A MOORISH TALE.,To leave the very city of his fame
17110,A MOORISH TALE.,Without an Ali to keep up his name.
17111,A MOORISH TALE.,

17118,A MOORISH TALE.,"Knowing a boy for certain must come of it,"
17119,A MOORISH TALE.,Or else he was not praying to his _Profit_.
17120,A MOORISH TALE.,
17121,A MOORISH TALE.,"Beer will grow _mothery_, and ladies fair"
17122,A MOORISH TALE.,Will grow like beer; so did that stag-eyed dame:
17123,A MOORISH TALE.,"Ben Ali, hoping for a son and heir,"
17124,A MOORISH TALE.,"Boy’d up his hopes, and even chose a name"
17125,A MOORISH TALE.,Of mighty hero that his child should bear;

18099,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,Little Dame W. thought when through the sash

18110,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,Unfatted!
18111,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,
18112,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Think of poor Burrell’s shock,"
18113,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Of Nature’s debt to see his hens all payers,"
18114,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"And laid in death as Everlasting Layers,"
18115,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"With Bantam’s small Ex-Emperor, the Cock,"
18116,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"In ruffled plumage and funereal hackle,"
18117,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Giving, undone by Cockle, a last Cackle!"
18118,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"To see as stiff as stone, his un’live stock,"
18119,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,It really was enough to move his block.
18120,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Down on the floor he dash’d, with horror big,"
18121,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,Mr. Beh’s third wife’s mother’s coachman’s wig;
18122,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"And with a tragic stare like his own Kemble,"
18123,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Burst out with natural emphasis enough,"
18124,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"And voice that grief made tremble,"
18125,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,Into that very speech of sad Macduff--
18126,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"“What!--all my pretty chickens and their dam,"
18127,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,At one fell swoop!--
18128,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,Just when I’d bought a coop

18130,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,
18131,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"After a little of this mood,"

18133,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"With razor he began to ope each craw,"
18134,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Already turning black, as black as coals;"
18135,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,When lo! the undigested cause he saw--
18136,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,“Pison’d by goles!”
18137,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,
18138,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"To Mrs. W.’s luck a contradiction,"
18139,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,Her window still stood open to conviction;
18140,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"And by short course of circumstantial labour,"
18141,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,He fixed the guilt upon his adverse neighbour;--
18142,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Lord! how he rail’d at her: declaring now,"
18143,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"He’d bring an action ere next Term of Hilary,"
18144,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Then, in another moment, swore a vow,"
18145,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,He’d make her do pill-penance in the pillory!
18146,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"She, meanwhile distant from the dimmest dream"
18147,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Of combating with guilt, yard-arm or arm-yard,"
18148,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,Lapp’d in a paradise of tea and cream;
18149,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,When up ran Betty with a dismal scream--
18150,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"“Here’s Mr. Burrell, ma’am, with all his farm-yard!”"
18151,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Straight in he came, unbowing and unbending,"
18152,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,With all the warmth that iron and a barber
18153,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,Can harbour;
18154,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"To dress the head and front of her offending,"
18155,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,The fuming phial of his wrath uncorking;
18156,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"In short, he made her pay him altogether,"
18157,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"In hard cash, very _hard_, for ev’ry feather,"
18158,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Charging of course, each Bantam as a Dorking;"
18159,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Nothing could move him, nothing made him supple,"
18160,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"So the sad dame unpocketing her loss,"
18161,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,"Had nothing left but to sit hands across,"
18162,A WATERLOO BALLAD.,And see her poultry “going down ten couple.”

19101,A BLOW UP.,"Along with mill-materials to roam,"

19847,THE BLUE BOAR.,(For wits in madness never jump)
19848,THE BLUE BOAR.,To liberate the beasts from Cross’s;

19869,THE BLUE BOAR.,"A fat, sleek, philosophic beast"
19870,THE BLUE BOAR.,"That never fretted in the least,"
19871,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Whether her grains were sour or sweet,"

19879,THE BLUE BOAR.,"In brief--as wit should be and fun,--"
19880,THE BLUE BOAR.,"If sows turn Quakers, she was one;"
19881,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Clad from the duckpond, thick and slab,"
19882,THE BLUE BOAR.,In bran-new muddy suit of drab.
19883,THE BLUE BOAR.,"To still the storm of such a lubber,"
19884,THE BLUE BOAR.,She came like oil--at least like blubber--
19885,THE BLUE BOAR.,Her pigtail of as passive shape
19886,THE BLUE BOAR.,As ever droop’d o’er powder’d nape;
19887,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Her snout, scarce turning up--her deep"
19888,THE BLUE BOAR.,Small eyes half settled into sleep;
19889,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Her ample ears, dependent, meek,"
19890,THE BLUE BOAR.,Like fig-leaves shading either cheek;
19891,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Whilst, from the corner of her jaw,"
19892,THE BLUE BOAR.,"A sprout of cabbage, green and raw,"
19893,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Protruded,--as the Dove, so stanch"
19894,THE BLUE BOAR.,"For Peace, supports an olive branch,--"
19895,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Her very grunt, so low and mild,"
19896,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Like the soft snoring of a child,"
19897,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Inquiring into his disquiets,"
19898,THE BLUE BOAR.,"Served like the Riot Act, at riots,--"

20032,THE BLUE BOAR.,"One’s tail beside the other’s nose,"

20788,THE GREEN MAN.,A married woman that had had
20789,THE GREEN MAN.,"Nine boys and gals, and none had turned out bad--"
20790,THE GREEN MAN.,"Her own dear late would come home late at night,"
20791,THE GREEN MAN.,"And liquor always got him in a fight,"
20792,THE GREEN MAN.,She’d been in Hospitals--she wouldn’t faint
20793,THE GREEN MAN.,At gores and gashes fingers wide and deep;
20794,THE GREEN MAN.,She knew what’s good for bruises and what ain’t--
20795,THE GREEN MAN.,Turlington’s Drops she made a p’int to keep.
20796,THE GREEN MAN.,Cases she’d seen beneath the surgent’s hand--
20797,THE GREEN MAN.,Such skulls japann’d--she meant to say trepann’d!
20798,THE GREEN MAN.,"Poor wretches! you would think they’d been in battle,"
20799,THE GREEN MAN.,"And hadn’t hours to live,"
20800,THE GREEN MAN.,"From tearing horses’ kicks or Smithfield cattle,"
20801,THE GREEN MAN.,Shamefully over-driv!--
20802,THE GREEN MAN.,"Heads forced to have a silver plate atop,"
20803,THE GREEN MAN.,To get the brains to stop.
20804,THE GREEN MAN.,"At imputations of the legs she’d been,"
20805,THE GREEN MAN.,And neither screech’d nor cried--
20806,THE GREEN MAN.,"Hereat she pluck’d the white cravat aside,"
20807,THE GREEN MAN.,And lo! the whole phenomenon was seen--
20808,THE GREEN MAN.,“Preserve us all! He’s going to gangrene!”
20809,THE GREEN MAN.,
20810,THE GREEN MAN.,Alas! through Simpson’s brain
20811,THE GREEN MAN.,"Shot the remark, like ball, with mortal pain;"
20812,THE GREEN MAN.,"It tallied truly with his own misgiving,"
20813,THE GREEN MAN.,"And brought a groan,"
20814,THE GREEN MAN.,To move a heart of stone--
20815,THE GREEN MAN.,A sort of farewell to the land of living!
20816,THE GREEN MAN.,"And as the case was imminent and urgent,"
20817,THE GREEN MAN.,He did not make a shadow of objection
20818,THE GREEN MAN.,"To Mrs. B.’s proposal for a “surgent,”"
20819,THE GREEN MAN.,"But merely gave a sight of deep dejection,"
20820,THE GREEN MAN.,While down the verdant cheek a tear of grief
20821,THE GREEN MAN.,"Stole, like a dew-drop on a cabbage-leaf."
20822,THE GREEN MAN.,"Swift flew the summons,--it was life or death!"
20823,THE GREEN MAN.,"And in as short a time as he could race it,"
20824,THE GREEN MAN.,"Came Doctor Puddicome as short of breath,"
20825,THE GREEN MAN.,To try his Latin charms against _Hic Jacet_.
20826,THE GREEN MAN.,"He took a seat beside the patient’s bed,"
20827,THE GREEN MAN.,"Saw tongue--felt pulse--examined the bad cheek,--"
20828,THE GREEN MAN.,"Poked, stroked, pinch’d, kneaded it--hemm’d--shook his head--"
20829,THE GREEN MAN.,"Took a long solemn pause the cause to seek,"
20830,THE GREEN MAN.,"(Thinking, it seem’d, in Greek,)"
20831,THE GREEN MAN.,"Then ask’d--‘twas Christmas--“Had he eaten grass,"
20832,THE GREEN MAN.,Or greens--and if the cook was so improper
20833,THE GREEN MAN.,"To boil them up with copper,"
20834,THE GREEN MAN.,Or farthings made of brass;
20835,THE GREEN MAN.,"Or if he drank his Hock from dark green glass,"
20836,THE GREEN MAN.,"Or dined at City Festivals, whereat"
20837,THE GREEN MAN.,"There’s turtle, and green fat?”"
20838,THE GREEN MAN.,"To all of which, with serious tone of woe,"
20839,THE GREEN MAN.,Poor Simpson answered “No.”
20840,THE GREEN MAN.,"Indeed he might have said in form auricular,"
20841,THE GREEN MAN.,Supposing Puddicome had been a monk--
20842,THE GREEN MAN.,He had not eaten (he had only drunk)
20843,THE GREEN MAN.,Of any thing “Particular.”
20844,THE GREEN MAN.,The Doctor was at fault;
20845,THE GREEN MAN.,A thing so new quite brought him to a halt.
20846,THE GREEN MAN.,"Cases of other colours came in crowds,"
20847,THE GREEN MAN.,"He could have found their remedy, and soon;"
20848,THE GREEN MAN.,"But green--it sent him up among the clouds,"
20849,THE GREEN MAN.,As if he had gone up with Green’s balloon!
20850,THE GREEN MAN.,Black with Black Jaundice he had seen the skin;
20851,THE GREEN MAN.,"From Yellow Jaundice yellow,"
20852,THE GREEN MAN.,From saffron tints to sallow;--
20853,THE GREEN MAN.,Then retrospective memory lugg’d in
20854,THE GREEN MAN.,"Old Purple Face, the Host at Kentish Town--"
20855,THE GREEN MAN.,"East Indians, without number,"
20856,THE GREEN MAN.,"He knew familiarly, by heat done Brown,"
20857,THE GREEN MAN.,"From tan to a burnt umber,"
20858,THE GREEN MAN.,Ev’n those eruptions he had never seen
20859,THE GREEN MAN.,"Of which the Caledonian Poet spoke,"
20860,THE GREEN MAN.,As “_rashes_ growing green!”
20861,THE GREEN MAN.,“Pooh! pooh! a rash grow green!
20862,THE GREEN MAN.,Nothing of course but a broad Scottish joke!”
20863,THE GREEN MAN.,"Then as to flaming visages, for those"
20864,THE GREEN MAN.,"The Scarlet Fever answer’d, or the Rose--"
20865,THE GREEN MAN.,But verdant that was quite a novel stroke!
20866,THE GREEN MAN.,"Men turn’d to blue, by Cholera’s last stage,"
20867,THE GREEN MAN.,In common practice he had really seen;
20868,THE GREEN MAN.,"But green--he was too old, and grave, and sage,"
20869,THE GREEN MAN.,To think of the last stage to Turnham Green!
20870,THE GREEN MAN.,
20871,THE GREEN MAN.,"So matters stood in-doors--meanwhile without,"
20872,THE GREEN MAN.,"Growing in going like all other rumours,"
20873,THE GREEN MAN.,"The modern miracle was buzz’d about,"
20874,THE GREEN MAN.,"By People of all humours,"
20875,THE GREEN MAN.,Native or foreign in their dialecticals;
20876,THE GREEN MAN.,"Till all the neighbourhood, as if their noses"
20877,THE GREEN MAN.,"Had taken the odd gross from little Moses,"
20878,THE GREEN MAN.,Seem’d looking thro’ green spectacles.
20879,THE GREEN MAN.,“Green faces!” so they all began to comment--
20880,THE GREEN MAN.,"“Yes--opposite to Druggist’s lighted shops,"
20881,THE GREEN MAN.,But that’s a flying colour--never stops--
20882,THE GREEN MAN.,A bottle-green that’s vanished in a moment.
20883,THE GREEN MAN.,"Green! nothing of the sort occurs to mind,"
20884,THE GREEN MAN.,Nothing at all to match the present piece;
20885,THE GREEN MAN.,Jack in the Green has nothing of the kind--
20886,THE GREEN MAN.,Green-grocers are not green--nor yet green geese!”
20887,THE GREEN MAN.,The oldest Supercargoes of Old Sailors
20888,THE GREEN MAN.,"Of such a case had never heard,"
20889,THE GREEN MAN.,From Emerald Isle to Cape de Verd;
20890,THE GREEN MAN.,“Or Greenland!” cried the whalers.

20896,THE GREEN MAN.,"A long half-hour, in needless puzzle,"
20897,THE GREEN MAN.,Our Galen’s cane had rubbed against his muzzle:

20919,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Had chased the huge fish about Baffin’s old Bay,"
20920,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"But time brought a change his diversion to spoil,"
20921,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,And that was when Gas took the shine out of Oil.
20922,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
20923,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"He turn’d up his nose at the fumes of the Coke,"
20924,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,And swore the whole scheme was a bottle of smoke:

20930,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"And hard by the Docks settled down for his life,"
20931,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"But, true to his text, went to Wales for a wife."
20932,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
20933,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"A big one she was, without figure or waist,"
20934,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"More bulky than lovely, but that was his taste;"
20935,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"In fat she was lapp’d from her sole to her crown,"

20938,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"But Ben like a Whaler was charm’d with the match,"

20955,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Old Tars in the trade, who related old tales,"
20956,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"And drank, and blew clouds that were “very like whales.”"
20957,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
20958,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Of course with their grog there was plenty of chat,"

20965,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"When, lo! as he lay by his partner in bed,"

20967,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
20968,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"“A start!” mutter’d Ben, in the Grampus afloat,"

20973,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Then groping about by the light of the moon,"
20974,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,He soon laid his hand on his trusty harpoon;
20975,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"A moment he poised it, to send it more pat,"
20976,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,And then made a plunge to imbed it in fat!
20977,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
20978,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"“Starn all!” he sang out, “as you care for your lives--"
20979,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Starn all, as you hope to return to your wives--"

20985,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"And swiftly advanced for a fathom or two,"
20986,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,As only a fish out of water could do.
20987,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
20988,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"“Starn all!” echoed Ben, with a movement aback,"
20989,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,But too slow to escape from the creature’s attack;
20990,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"If flippers it had, they were furnish’d with nails,--"
20991,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"“You willin, I’ll teach you that Women an’t Whales!”"
20992,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
20993,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"“Avast!” shouted Ben, with a sort of a screech,"
20994,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"“I’ve heard a Whale spouting, but _here_ is a speech!”"
20995,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"“A-spouting, indeed!--very pretty,” said she;"

20997,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
20998,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,“To go to pretend to take _me_ for a fish!

21007,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
21008,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"“Lord, Polly!” said Ben, “such a deed could I do?"
21009,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,I’d rather have murder’d all Wapping than you!
21010,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Come, forgive what is passed.” “O you monster!” she cried,"
21011,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,“It was none of your fault that it passed of one side!”
21012,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
21013,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"However, at last she inclined to forgive;"

22854,A TRUE STORY.,But mercy was not long attendant:
22855,A TRUE STORY.,"From words at last he took to blows,"
