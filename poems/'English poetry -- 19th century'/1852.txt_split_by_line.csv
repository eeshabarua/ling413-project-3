28,DEDICATION.,
29,TO MY FATHER.,TO MY FATHER.
30,TO MY FATHER.,
31,TO MY FATHER.,
32,TO MY FATHER.,"I dedicate to you a work, which is submitted to the public with a"
33,TO MY FATHER.,diffidence and hesitation proportioned to the novelty of the effort
34,TO MY FATHER.,it represents.  For in this poem I have abandoned those forms of
35,TO MY FATHER.,"verse with which I had most familiarized my thoughts, and have"
36,TO MY FATHER.,endeavored to follow a path on which I could discover no footprints
37,TO MY FATHER.,"before me, either to guide or to warn."
38,TO MY FATHER.,
39,TO MY FATHER.,There is a moment of profound discouragement which succeeds to
40,TO MY FATHER.,"prolonged effort; when, the labor which has become a habit having"
41,TO MY FATHER.,"ceased, we miss the sustaining sense of its companionship, and"
42,TO MY FATHER.,"stand, with a feeling of strangeness and embarrassment, before the"
43,TO MY FATHER.,"abrupt and naked result.  As regards myself, in the present"
44,TO MY FATHER.,"instance, the force of all such sensations is increased by the"
45,TO MY FATHER.,circumstances to which I have referred.  And in this moment of
46,TO MY FATHER.,"discouragement and doubt, my heart instinctively turns to you, from"
47,TO MY FATHER.,"whom it has so often sought, from whom it has never failed to"
48,TO MY FATHER.,"receive, support."
49,TO MY FATHER.,
50,TO MY FATHER.,I do not inscribe to you this book because it contains anything
51,TO MY FATHER.,that is worthy of the beloved and honored name with which I thus
52,TO MY FATHER.,seek to associate it; nor yet because I would avail myself of a
53,TO MY FATHER.,vulgar pretext to display in public an affection that is best
54,TO MY FATHER.,honored by the silence which it renders sacred.
55,TO MY FATHER.,
56,TO MY FATHER.,"Feelings only such as those with which, in days when there existed"
57,TO MY FATHER.,"for me no critic less gentle than yourself, I brought to you my"
58,TO MY FATHER.,"childish manuscripts; feelings only such as those which have, in"
59,TO MY FATHER.,"later years, associated with your heart all that has moved or"
60,TO MY FATHER.,"occupied my own,--lead me once more to seek assurance from the"
61,TO MY FATHER.,grasp of that hand which has hitherto been my guide and comfort
62,TO MY FATHER.,through the life I owe to you.
63,TO MY FATHER.,
64,TO MY FATHER.,"And as in childhood, when existence had no toil beyond the day's"
65,TO MY FATHER.,"simple lesson, no ambition beyond the neighboring approval of the"
66,TO MY FATHER.,"night, I brought to you the morning's task for the evening's"
67,TO MY FATHER.,"sanction, so now I bring to you this self-appointed taskwork of"
68,TO MY FATHER.,"maturer years; less confident indeed of your approval, but not less"
69,TO MY FATHER.,confident of your love; and anxious only to realize your presence
70,TO MY FATHER.,"between myself and the public, and to mingle with those severer"
71,TO MY FATHER.,voices to whose final sentence I submit my work the beloved and
72,TO MY FATHER.,gracious accents of your own.

121,II.,"Now in May Fair, of course,--in the fair month of May--"
122,II.,"When life is abundant, and busy, and gay:"
123,II.,When the markets of London are noisy about
124,II.,"Young ladies, and strawberries,--""only just out;"""
125,II.,"Fresh strawberries sold under all the house-eaves,"
126,II.,And young ladies on sale for the strawberry-leaves:

129,II.,In the sunbeam of Fashion; and even Blue Books
130,II.,"Take a heavy-wing'd flight, and grow busy as rooks;"
131,II.,"And the postman (that Genius, indifferent and stern,"
132,II.,"Who shakes out even-handed to all, from his urn,"

134,II.,"Shall be fretful and anxious, or joyous and gay)"
135,II.,"Brings, each morning, more letters of one sort or other"

139,II.,"Why, when quietly munching your dry toast and butter,"
140,II.,Your nerves should be suddenly thrown in a flutter
141,II.,"At the sight of a neat little letter, address'd"
142,II.,"In a woman's handwriting, containing, half guess'd,"
143,II.,"An odor of violets faint as the Spring,"
144,II.,And coquettishly seal'd with a small signet-ring.
145,II.,"But in Autumn, the season of sombre reflection,"

147,II.,"Far from London and Paris, and ill at one's ease,"

152,II.,"Are all a man finds for his day's occupation,"
153,II.,"The whole case, believe me, is totally changed,"
154,II.,And a letter may alter the plans we arranged
155,II.,"Over-night, for the slaughter of time--a wild beast,"
156,II.,"Which, though classified yet by no naturalist,"
157,II.,"Abounds in these mountains, more hard to ensnare,"

164,III.,"I marvel less, therefore, that, having already"
165,III.,"Torn open this note, with a hand most unsteady,"
166,III.,Lord Alfred was startled.
167,III.,The month is September;
168,III.,"Time, morning; the scene at Bigorre; (pray remember"
169,III.,"These facts, gentle reader, because I intend"
170,III.,To fling all the unities by at the end.)
171,III.,He walk'd to the window.  The morning was chill:
172,III.,The brown woods were crisp'd in the cold on the hill:
173,III.,The sole thing abroad in the streets was the wind:
174,III.,"And the straws on the gust, like the thoughts in his mind,"
175,III.,"Rose, and eddied around and around, as tho' teasing"
176,III.,"Each other.  The prospect, in truth, was unpleasing:"
177,III.,"And Lord Alfred, whilst moodily gazing around it,"
178,III.,To himself more than once (vex'd in soul) sigh'd

200,JOHN.,The man who has anything better to do;
201,JOHN.,"And yet so far forgets himself, so far degrades"
202,JOHN.,"His position as Man, to this worst of all trades,"
203,JOHN.,"Which even a well-brought-up ape were above,"
204,JOHN.,"To travel about with a woman in love,--"
205,JOHN.,Unless she's in love with himself.

219,ALFRED.,

223,JOHN.,"I had rather be bored, my dear Alfred, by you,"

225,JOHN.,"That perverse, imperturbable, golden-hair'd elf--"

233,JOHN.,JOHN.
234,JOHN.,
235,JOHN.,"Yes! she,"
236,JOHN.,Of course! who but she could contrive so to keep
237,JOHN.,"One's eyes, and one's feet too, from falling asleep"

239,JOHN.,
240,ALFRED.,ALFRED.

242,ALFRED.,What's the matter?
243,ALFRED.,
244,JOHN.,JOHN.
245,JOHN.,
246,JOHN.,"Why, she is--a matter, the more"
247,JOHN.,"I consider about it, the more it demands"
248,JOHN.,An attention it does not deserve; and expands
249,JOHN.,"Beyond the dimensions which ev'n crinoline,"
250,JOHN.,"When possess'd by a fair face, and saucy Eighteen,"
251,JOHN.,"Is entitled to take in this very small star,"
252,JOHN.,"Already too crowded, as I think, by far."

263,JOHN.,Of one mere human creature's legitimate space
264,JOHN.,"In this world?  Mars, Apollo, Virorum! the case"

297,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
298,ALFRED.,
299,ALFRED.,Read on.  You'll discern.

302,ALFRED.,
303,ALFRED.,"""Those letters I ask you, my lord, to return.""..."
304,ALFRED.,Humph!... Letters!... the matter is worse than I guess'd;
305,ALFRED.,I have my misgivings--
306,ALFRED.,
307,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
308,ALFRED.,
309,ALFRED.,"Well, read out the rest,"

314,JOHN.,Eh?... Where was I?

364,ALFRED.,"Oh, that"
365,ALFRED.,You must manage!
366,ALFRED.,
367,JOHN.,JOHN.
368,JOHN.,
369,JOHN.,"Must I?  I decline it, though, flat."
370,JOHN.,"In an hour the horses will be at the door,"
371,JOHN.,And Matilda is now in her habit.  Before
372,JOHN.,"I have finished my breakfast, of course I receive"
373,JOHN.,"A message for ""dear Cousin John!""...  I must leave"
374,JOHN.,At the jeweller's the bracelet which YOU broke last night;
375,JOHN.,"I must call for the music.  ""Dear Alfred is right:"
376,JOHN.,The black shawl looks best: WILL I change it?  Of course
377,JOHN.,"I can just stop, in passing, to order the horse."

389,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
390,ALFRED.,
391,ALFRED.,"Very well,"
392,ALFRED.,You must think--

396,JOHN.,"What excuse will you make, tho'?"

398,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
399,ALFRED.,
400,ALFRED.,"Oh, tell"
401,ALFRED.,"Mrs. Darcy that... lend me your wits, Jack!...  The deuce!"
402,ALFRED.,Can you not stretch your genius to fit a friend's use?
403,ALFRED.,"Excuses are clothes which, when ask'd unawares,"

422,ALFRED.,"Don't ask me.  I have not a choice, my dear John."
423,ALFRED.,"Besides, shall I own a strange sort of desire,"
424,ALFRED.,Before I extinguish forever the fire
425,ALFRED.,"Of youth and romance, in whose shadowy light"
426,ALFRED.,"Hope whisper'd her first fairy tales, to excite"
427,ALFRED.,"The last spark, till it rise, and fade far in that dawn"
428,ALFRED.,Of my days where the twilights of life were first drawn
429,ALFRED.,"By the rosy, reluctant auroras of Love;"
430,ALFRED.,"In short, from the dead Past the gravestone to move;"
431,ALFRED.,Of the years long departed forever to take
432,ALFRED.,"One last look, one final farewell; to awake"
433,ALFRED.,"The Heroic of youth from the Hades of joy,"
434,ALFRED.,"And once more be, though but for an hour, Jack--a boy!"

436,JOHN.,JOHN.
437,JOHN.,
438,JOHN.,You had better go hang yourself.
439,JOHN.,
440,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
441,ALFRED.,
442,ALFRED.,No! were it but
443,ALFRED.,"To make sure that the Past from the Future is shut,"
444,ALFRED.,It were worth the step back.  Do you think we should live
445,ALFRED.,"With the living so lightly, and learn to survive"
446,ALFRED.,That wild moment in which to the grave and its gloom
447,ALFRED.,"We consign'd our heart's best, if the doors of the tomb"
448,ALFRED.,Were not lock'd with a key which Fate keeps for our sake?
449,ALFRED.,If the dead could return or the corpses awake?

452,JOHN.,
453,JOHN.,Nonsense!
454,JOHN.,
455,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
456,ALFRED.,
457,ALFRED.,Not wholly.  The man who gets up
458,ALFRED.,"A fill'd guest from the banquet, and drains off his cup,"
459,ALFRED.,"Sees the last lamp extinguish'd with cheerfulness, goes"
460,ALFRED.,"Well contented to bed, and enjoys its repose."
461,ALFRED.,"But he who hath supp'd at the tables of kings,"
462,ALFRED.,And yet starved in the sight of luxurious things;
463,ALFRED.,"Who hath watch'd the wine flow, by himself but half tasted;"
464,ALFRED.,"Heard the music, and yet miss'd the tune; who hath wasted"
465,ALFRED.,"One part of life's grand possibilities:--friend,"
466,ALFRED.,"That man will bear with him, be sure, to the end,"
467,ALFRED.,"A blighted experience, a rancor within:"
468,ALFRED.,"You may call it a virtue, I call it a sin."
469,ALFRED.,
470,JOHN.,JOHN.
471,JOHN.,
472,JOHN.,I see you remember the cynical story
473,JOHN.,Of that wicked old piece Experience--a hoary
474,JOHN.,"Lothario, whom dying, the priest by his bed"
475,JOHN.,"(Knowing well the unprincipled life he had led,"
476,JOHN.,"And observing, with no small amount of surprise,"
477,JOHN.,Resignation and calm in the old sinner's eyes)
478,JOHN.,Ask'd if he had nothing that weigh'd on his mind:
479,JOHN.,"""Well,... no,""... says Lothario, ""I think not.  I find,"
480,JOHN.,"On reviewing my life, which in most things was pleasant,"
481,JOHN.,"I never neglected, when once it was present,"
482,JOHN.,"An occasion of pleasing myself.  On the whole,"
483,JOHN.,"I have naught to regret;""... and so, smiling, his soul"
484,JOHN.,Took its flight from this world.
485,JOHN.,
486,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
487,ALFRED.,
488,ALFRED.,"Well, Regret or Remorse,"
489,ALFRED.,Which is best?
490,ALFRED.,
491,JOHN.,JOHN.
492,JOHN.,
493,JOHN.,"Why, Regret."
494,JOHN.,
495,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
496,ALFRED.,
497,ALFRED.,"No; Remorse, Jack, of course:"
498,ALFRED.,"For the one is related, be sure, to the other."
499,ALFRED.,"Regret is a spiteful old maid: but her brother,"

501,ALFRED.,"HAS been wed to young Pleasure.  Dear Jack, hang Regret!"
502,ALFRED.,
503,JOHN.,JOHN.
504,JOHN.,
505,JOHN.,"Bref! you mean, then, to go?"
506,JOHN.,
507,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
508,ALFRED.,
509,ALFRED.,Bref! I do.
510,ALFRED.,
511,JOHN.,JOHN.
512,JOHN.,
513,JOHN.,One word... stay!
514,JOHN.,Are you really in love with Matilda?
515,JOHN.,
516,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
517,ALFRED.,
518,ALFRED.,"Love, eh?"
519,ALFRED.,What a question!  Of course.
520,ALFRED.,
521,JOHN.,JOHN.
522,JOHN.,
523,JOHN.,WERE you really in love
524,JOHN.,With Madame de Nevers?
525,JOHN.,
526,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
527,ALFRED.,
528,ALFRED.,"What; Lucile?  No, by Jove,"
529,ALFRED.,Never REALLY.
530,ALFRED.,
531,JOHN.,JOHN.
532,JOHN.,
533,JOHN.,She's pretty?
534,JOHN.,
535,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
536,ALFRED.,
537,ALFRED.,Decidedly so.
538,ALFRED.,"At least, so she was, some ten summers ago."
539,ALFRED.,"As soft, and as sallow as Autumn--with hair"
540,ALFRED.,"Neither black, nor yet brown, but that tinge which the air"
541,ALFRED.,"Takes at eve in September, when night lingers lone"
542,ALFRED.,"Through a vineyard, from beams of a slow-setting sun."
543,ALFRED.,Eyes--the wistful gazelle's; the fine foot of a fairy;
544,ALFRED.,"And a hand fit a fay's wand to wave,--white and airy;"
545,ALFRED.,A voice soft and sweet as a tune that one knows.
546,ALFRED.,"Something in her there was, set you thinking of those"
547,ALFRED.,Strange backgrounds of Raphael... that hectic and deep
548,ALFRED.,Brief twilight in which southern suns fall asleep.
549,ALFRED.,
550,JOHN.,JOHN.
551,JOHN.,
552,JOHN.,Coquette?
553,JOHN.,
554,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
555,ALFRED.,
556,ALFRED.,Not at all.  'Twas her one fault.  Not she!
557,ALFRED.,"I had loved her the better, had she less loved me."
558,ALFRED.,The heart of a man's like that delicate weed
559,ALFRED.,"Which requires to be trampled on, boldly indeed,"
560,ALFRED.,Ere it give forth the fragrance you wish to extract.
561,ALFRED.,"'Tis a simile, trust me, if not new, exact."
562,ALFRED.,
563,JOHN.,JOHN.
564,JOHN.,
565,JOHN.,Women change so.
566,JOHN.,
567,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
568,ALFRED.,
569,ALFRED.,Of course.
570,ALFRED.,
571,JOHN.,JOHN.
572,JOHN.,
573,JOHN.,"And, unless rumor errs,"
574,JOHN.,"I believe, that last year, the Comtesse de Nevers*"
575,JOHN.,Was at Baden the rage--held an absolute court
576,JOHN.,"Of devoted adorers, and really made sport"
577,JOHN.,Of her subjects.
578,JOHN.,
579,JOHN.,
580,JOHN.,"* O Shakespeare! how couldst thou ask ""What's in a name?"""
581,JOHN.,"'Tis the devil's in it, when a bard has to frame"
582,JOHN.,English rhymes for alliance with names that are French:
583,JOHN.,"And in these rhymes of mine, well I know that I trench"
584,JOHN.,"All too far on that license which critics refuse,"
585,JOHN.,"With just right, to accord to a well-brought-up Muse."
586,JOHN.,"Yet, tho' faulty the union, in many a line,"
587,JOHN.,"'Twixt my British-born verse and my French heroine,"
588,JOHN.,"Since, however auspiciously wedded they be,"
589,JOHN.,"There is many a pair that yet cannot agree,"
590,JOHN.,"Your forgiveness for this pair, the author invites,"
591,JOHN.,"Whom necessity, not inclination, unites."
592,JOHN.,
593,JOHN.,
594,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
595,ALFRED.,
596,ALFRED.,Indeed!
597,ALFRED.,
598,JOHN.,JOHN.
599,JOHN.,
600,JOHN.,When she broke off with you
601,JOHN.,"Her engagement, her heart did not break with it?"
602,JOHN.,
603,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
604,ALFRED.,
605,ALFRED.,Pooh!
606,ALFRED.,"Pray would you have had her dress always in black,"
607,ALFRED.,"And shut herself up in a convent, dear Jack?"
608,ALFRED.,"Besides, 'twas my fault the engagement was broken."
609,ALFRED.,
610,JOHN.,JOHN.
611,JOHN.,
612,JOHN.,Most likely.  How was it?
613,JOHN.,
614,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
615,ALFRED.,
616,ALFRED.,The tale is soon spoken.
617,ALFRED.,She bored me.  I show'd it.  She saw it.  What next?
618,ALFRED.,She reproach'd.  I retorted.  Of course she was vex'd.
619,ALFRED.,I was vex'd that she was so.  She sulk'd.  So did I.
620,ALFRED.,"If I ask'd her to sing, she look'd ready to cry."
621,ALFRED.,"I was contrite, submissive.  She soften'd.  I harden'd."
622,ALFRED.,At noon I was banish'd.  At eve I was pardon'd.
623,ALFRED.,She said I had no heart.  I said she had no reason.
624,ALFRED.,I swore she talk'd nonsense.  She sobb'd I talk'd treason.
625,ALFRED.,"In short, my dear fellow, 'twas time, as you see,"
626,ALFRED.,"Things should come to a crisis, and finish.  'Twas she"
627,ALFRED.,By whom to that crisis the matter was brought.
628,ALFRED.,"She released me.  I linger'd.  I linger'd, she thought,"
629,ALFRED.,"With too sullen an aspect.  This gave me, of course,"
630,ALFRED.,"The occasion to fly in a rage, mount my horse,"
631,ALFRED.,And declare myself uncomprehended.  And so
632,ALFRED.,We parted.  The rest of the story you know.
633,ALFRED.,
634,JOHN.,JOHN.
635,JOHN.,
636,JOHN.,"No, indeed."
637,JOHN.,
638,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
639,ALFRED.,
640,ALFRED.,"Well, we parted.  Of course we could not"
641,ALFRED.,"Continue to meet, as before, in one spot."
642,ALFRED.,You conceive it was awkward?  Even Don Ferdinando
643,ALFRED.,"Can do, you remember, no more than he can do."
644,ALFRED.,"I think that I acted exceedingly well,"
645,ALFRED.,"Considering the time when this rupture befell,"
646,ALFRED.,For Paris was charming just then.  It deranged
647,ALFRED.,All my plans for the winter.  I ask'd to be changed--
648,ALFRED.,"Wrote for Naples, then vacant--obtain'd it--and so"
649,ALFRED.,"Join'd my new post at once; but scarce reach'd it, when lo!"
650,ALFRED.,My first news from Paris informs me Lucile
651,ALFRED.,"Is ill, and in danger.  Conceive what I feel."
652,ALFRED.,"I fly back.  I find her recover'd, but yet"
653,ALFRED.,Looking pale.  I am seized with a contrite regret;
654,ALFRED.,I ask to renew the engagement.
655,ALFRED.,
656,JOHN.,JOHN.
657,JOHN.,
658,JOHN.,And she?
659,JOHN.,
660,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
661,ALFRED.,
662,ALFRED.,"Reflects, but declines.  We part, swearing to be"
663,ALFRED.,"Friends ever, friends only.  All that sort of thing!"
664,ALFRED.,We each keep our letters... a portrait... a ring...
665,ALFRED.,With a pledge to return them whenever the one
666,ALFRED.,Or the other shall call for them back.
667,ALFRED.,
668,JOHN.,JOHN.
669,JOHN.,
670,JOHN.,Pray go on.
671,JOHN.,
672,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
673,ALFRED.,
674,ALFRED.,My story is finish'd.  Of course I enjoin
675,ALFRED.,On Lucile all those thousand good maxims we coin
676,ALFRED.,"To supply the grim deficit found in our days,"
677,ALFRED.,When love leaves them bankrupt.  I preach.  She obeys.
678,ALFRED.,She goes out in the world; takes to dancing once more--
679,ALFRED.,A pleasure she rarely indulged in before.
680,ALFRED.,"I go back to my post, and collect (I must own"
681,ALFRED.,"'Tis a taste I had never before, my dear John)"
682,ALFRED.,"Antiques and small Elzevirs.  Heigho! now, Jack,"
683,ALFRED.,You know all.
684,ALFRED.,
685,ALFRED.,JOHN (after a pause).
686,ALFRED.,
687,ALFRED.,You are really resolved to go back?
688,ALFRED.,
689,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
690,ALFRED.,
691,ALFRED.,"Eh, where?"
692,ALFRED.,
693,JOHN.,JOHN.
694,JOHN.,
695,JOHN.,To that worst of all places--the past.
696,JOHN.,You remember Lot's wife?
697,JOHN.,
698,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
699,ALFRED.,
700,ALFRED.,'Twas a promise when last
701,ALFRED.,We parted.  My honor is pledged to it.
702,ALFRED.,
703,JOHN.,JOHN.
704,JOHN.,
705,JOHN.,"Well,"
706,JOHN.,What is it you wish me to do?
707,JOHN.,
708,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
709,ALFRED.,
710,ALFRED.,You must tell
711,ALFRED.,"Matilda, I meant to have call'd--to leave word--"
712,ALFRED.,To explain--but the time was so pressing--
713,ALFRED.,
714,JOHN.,JOHN.
715,JOHN.,
716,JOHN.,"My lord,"
717,JOHN.,Your lordship's obedient!  I really can't do...
718,JOHN.,
719,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
720,ALFRED.,
721,ALFRED.,You wish then to break off my marriage?
722,ALFRED.,
723,JOHN.,JOHN.
724,JOHN.,
725,JOHN.,"No, no!"
726,JOHN.,But indeed I can't see why yourself you need take
727,JOHN.,These letters.
728,JOHN.,
729,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
730,ALFRED.,
731,ALFRED.,"Not see?  would you have me, then, break"
732,ALFRED.,A promise my honor is pledged to?
733,ALFRED.,
734,ALFRED.,JOHN (humming).
735,ALFRED.,
736,ALFRED.,"""Off, off"

738,ALFRED.,
739,ALFRED.,ALFRED.

741,ALFRED.,"Oh, good! oh, you scoff!"
742,ALFRED.,
743,JOHN.,JOHN.

745,JOHN.,"At what, my dear Alfred?"
746,JOHN.,
747,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
748,ALFRED.,
749,ALFRED.,At all things!
750,JOHN.,JOHN.
751,JOHN.,Indeed?
752,JOHN.,
753,JOHN.,
754,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
755,ALFRED.,
756,ALFRED.,Yes; I see that your heart is as dry as a reed:
757,ALFRED.,That the dew of your youth is rubb'd off you: I see
758,ALFRED.,"You have no feeling left in you, even for me!"
759,ALFRED.,At honor you jest; you are cold as a stone
760,ALFRED.,To the warm voice of friendship.  Belief you have none;
761,ALFRED.,You have lost faith in all things.  You carry a blight
762,ALFRED.,"About with you everywhere.  Yes, at the sight"
763,ALFRED.,"Of such callous indifference, who could be calm?"
764,ALFRED.,"I must leave you at once, Jack, or else the last balm"
765,ALFRED.,That is left me in Gilead you'll turn into gall.
766,ALFRED.,"Heartless, cold, unconcern'd..."
767,ALFRED.,
768,JOHN.,JOHN.
769,JOHN.,
770,JOHN.,Have you done?  Is that all?
771,JOHN.,"Well, then, listen to me!  I presume when you made"
772,JOHN.,"up your mind to propose to Miss Darcy, you weigh'd"
773,JOHN.,"All the drawbacks against the equivalent gains,"
774,JOHN.,Ere you finally settled the point.  What remains
775,JOHN.,But to stick to your choice?  You want money: 'tis here.
776,JOHN.,A settled position: 'tis yours.  A career:
777,JOHN.,"You secure it.  A wife, young, and pretty as rich,"
778,JOHN.,Whom all men will envy you.  Why must you itch
779,JOHN.,"To be running away, on the eve of all this,"
780,JOHN.,To a woman whom never for once did you miss
781,JOHN.,All these years since you left her?  Who knows what may hap?
782,JOHN.,This letter--to ME--is a palpable trap.
783,JOHN.,The woman has changed since you knew her.  Perchance
784,JOHN.,She yet seeks to renew her youth's broken romance.
785,JOHN.,When women begin to feel youth and their beauty
786,JOHN.,"Slip from them, they count it a sort of a duty"
787,JOHN.,To let nothing else slip away unsecured
788,JOHN.,"Which these, while they lasted, might once have procured."
789,JOHN.,"Lucile's a coquette to the end of her fingers,"
790,JOHN.,I will stake my last farthing.  Perhaps the wish lingers
791,JOHN.,"To recall the once reckless, indifferent lover"
792,JOHN.,To the feet he has left; let intrigue now recover
793,JOHN.,"What truth could not keep.  'Twere a vengeance, no doubt--"
794,JOHN.,A triumph;--but why must YOU bring it about?
795,JOHN.,You are risking the substance of all that you schemed
796,JOHN.,To obtain; and for what? some mad dream you have dream'd.
797,JOHN.,
798,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
799,ALFRED.,
800,ALFRED.,"But there's nothing to risk.  You exaggerate, Jack,"
801,ALFRED.,"You mistake.  In three days, at the most, I am back."
802,ALFRED.,
803,JOHN.,JOHN.
804,JOHN.,
805,JOHN.,"Ay, but how?... discontented, unsettled, upset,"
806,JOHN.,Bearing with you a comfortless twinge of regret.
807,JOHN.,"Preoccupied, sulky, and likely enough"
808,JOHN.,To make your betroth'd break off all in a huff.
809,JOHN.,"Three days, do you say?  But in three days who knows"
810,JOHN.,"What may happen?  I don't, nor do you, I suppose."

817,V.,"The one most abundantly furnish'd and found us,"
818,V.,"And which, for that reason, we least care about,"
819,V.,"And can best spare our friends, is good counsel, no doubt."
820,V.,"But advice, when 'tis sought from a friend (though civility"
821,V.,"May forbid to avow it), means mere liability"
822,V.,"In the bill we already have drawn on Remorse,"
823,V.,Which we deem that a true friend is bound to indorse.
824,V.,A mere lecture on debt from that friend is a bore.
825,V.,"Thus, the better his cousin's advice was, the more"
826,V.,Alfred Vargrave with angry resentment opposed it.
827,V.,"And, having the worst of the contest, he closed it"
828,V.,"With so firm a resolve his bad ground to maintain,"
829,V.,"That, sadly perceiving resistance was vain,"
830,V.,"And argument fruitless, the amiable Jack"
831,V.,Came to terms and assisted his cousin to pack
832,V.,A slender valise (the one small condescension
833,V.,"Which his final remonstrance obtain'd), whose dimension"
834,V.,"Excluded large outfits; and, cursing his stars, he"

844,VI.,"In what Virgil has call'd, ""Youth's purpureal light"""
845,VI.,"(I like the expression, and can't find a better)."
846,VI.,He sigh'd as he look'd at her.  Did he regret her?
847,VI.,"In her habit and hat, with her glad golden hair,"
848,VI.,"As airy and blithe as a blithe bird in air,"
849,VI.,"And her arch rosy lips, and her eager blue eyes,"
850,VI.,"With her little impertinent look of surprise,"
851,VI.,"And her round youthful figure, and fair neck, below"
852,VI.,"The dark drooping feather, as radiant as snow,--"
853,VI.,"I can only declare, that if I had the chance"
854,VI.,Of passing three days in the exquisite glance
855,VI.,"Of those eyes, or caressing the hand that now petted"
856,VI.,"That fine English mare, I should much have regretted"
857,VI.,Whatever might lose me one little half-hour
858,VI.,"Of a pastime so pleasant, when once in my power."
859,VI.,"For, if one drop of milk from the bright Milky Way"

918,III.,III.
919,III.,
920,III.,
921,III.,The age is gone o'er
922,III.,When a man may in all things be all.  We have more
923,III.,"Painters, poets, musicians, and artists, no doubt,"
924,III.,Than the great Cinquecento gave birth to; but out
925,III.,"Of a million of mere dilettanti, when, when"
926,III.,Will a new LEONARDO arise on our ken?
927,III.,He is gone with the age which begat him.  Our own
928,III.,"Is too vast, and too complex, for one man alone"
929,III.,"To embody its purpose, and hold it shut close"
930,III.,In the palm of his hand.  There were giants in those
931,III.,"Irreclaimable days; but in these days of ours,"
932,III.,"In dividing the work, we distribute the powers."
933,III.,Yet a dwarf on a dead giant's shoulders sees more
934,III.,Than the 'live giant's eyesight availed to explore;
935,III.,And in life's lengthen'd alphabet what used to be
936,III.,To our sires X Y Z is to us A B C.
937,III.,"A Vanini is roasted alive for his pains,"
938,III.,But a Bacon comes after and picks up his brains.
939,III.,A Bruno is angrily seized by the throttle
940,III.,"And hunted about by thy ghost, Aristotle,"
941,III.,Till a More or Lavater step into his place:
942,III.,Then the world turns and makes an admiring grimace.
943,III.,"Once the men were so great and so few, they appear,"
944,III.,"Through a distant Olympian atmosphere,"
945,III.,Like vast Caryatids upholding the age.
946,III.,"Now the men are so many and small, disengage"
947,III.,"One man from the million to mark him, next moment"

949,III.,And since we seek vainly (to praise in our songs)
950,III.,"'Mid our fellows the size which to heroes belongs,"
951,III.,"We take the whole age for a hero, in want"
952,III.,"Of a better; and still, in its favor, descant"

960,IV.,Alfred Vargrave was one of those men who achieve
961,IV.,"So little, because of the much they conceive:"
962,IV.,With irresolute finger he knock'd at each one
963,IV.,"Of the doorways of life, and abided in none."
964,IV.,"His course, by each star that would cross it, was set,"
965,IV.,And whatever he did he was sure to regret.
966,IV.,"That target, discuss'd by the travellers of old,"
967,IV.,"Which to one appear'd argent, to one appear'd gold,"
968,IV.,"To him, ever lingering on Doubt's dizzy margent,"
969,IV.,Appear'd in one moment both golden and argent.
970,IV.,"The man who seeks one thing in life, and but one,"
971,IV.,May hope to achieve it before life be done;
972,IV.,"But he who seeks all things, wherever he goes,"
973,IV.,Only reaps from the hopes which around him he sows
974,IV.,A harvest of barren regrets.  And the worm
975,IV.,That crawls on in the dust to the definite term
976,IV.,"Of its creeping existence, and sees nothing more"
977,IV.,"Than the path it pursues till its creeping be o'er,"
978,IV.,"In its limited vision, is happier far"
979,IV.,"Than the Half-Sage, whose course, fix'd by no friendly star"
980,IV.,"Is by each star distracted in turn, and who knows"
981,IV.,Each will still be as distant wherever he goes.

1011,VI.,Lusty fruitage have borne in his manhood's full growth;
1012,VI.,"But it found him too soon, when his nature was still"
1013,VI.,"The delicate toy of too pliant a will,"
1014,VI.,"The boisterous wind of the world to resist,"
1015,VI.,Or the frost of the world's wintry wisdom.
1016,VI.,He miss'd
1017,VI.,"That occasion, too rathe in its advent."

1867,II.,"Was a woman of genius: whose genius, indeed,"
1868,II.,"With her life was at war.  Once, but once, in that life"
1869,II.,The chance had been hers to escape from this strife
1870,II.,In herself; finding peace in the life of another
1871,II.,"From the passionate wants she, in hers, failed to smother."
1872,II.,"But the chance fell too soon, when the crude restless power"
1873,II.,"Which had been to her nature so fatal a dower,"
1874,II.,Only wearied the man it yet haunted and thrall'd;
1875,II.,"And that moment, once lost, had been never recall'd."
1876,II.,"Yet it left her heart sore: and, to shelter her heart"
1877,II.,"From approach, she then sought, in that delicate art"
1878,II.,"Of concealment, those thousand adroit strategies"
1879,II.,"Of feminine wit, which repel while they please,"
1880,II.,"A weapon, at once, and a shield to conceal"
1881,II.,And defend all that women can earnestly feel.
1882,II.,"Thus, striving her instincts to hide and repress,"
1883,II.,She felt frighten'd at times by her very success:
1884,II.,"She pined for the hill-tops, the clouds, and the stars:"
1885,II.,Golden wires may annoy us as much as steel bars
1886,II.,If they keep us behind prison windows: impassion'd
1887,II.,Her heart rose and burst the light cage she had fashion'd
1888,II.,Out of glittering trifles around it.
1889,II.,
1890,II.,Unknown
1891,II.,"To herself, all her instincts, without hesitation,"
1892,II.,Embraced the idea of self-immolation.
1893,II.,"The strong spirit in her, had her life been but blended"
1894,II.,"With some man's whose heart had her own comprehended,"
1895,II.,All its wealth at his feet would have lavishly thrown.
1896,II.,For him she had struggled and striven alone;
1897,II.,For him had aspired; in him had transfused
1898,II.,All the gladness and grace of her nature; and used
1899,II.,For him only the spells of its delicate power:
1900,II.,Like the ministering fairy that brings from her bower
1901,II.,"To some maze all the treasures, whose use the fond elf,"
1902,II.,"More enrich'd by her love, disregards for herself."
1903,II.,"But standing apart, as she ever had done,"
1904,II.,"And her genius, which needed a vent, finding none"
1905,II.,"In the broad fields of action thrown wide to man's power,"
1906,II.,"She unconsciously made it her bulwark and tower,"
1907,II.,"And built in it her refuge, whence lightly she hurl'd"
1908,II.,Her contempt at the fashions and forms of the world.
1909,II.,
1910,II.,And the permanent cause why she now miss'd and fail'd
1911,II.,"That firm hold upon life she so keenly assail'd,"
1912,II.,"Was, in all those diurnal occasions that place"
1913,II.,"Say--the world and the woman opposed face to face,"
1914,II.,"Where the woman must yield, she, refusing to stir,"
1915,II.,"Offended the world, which in turn wounded her."
1916,II.,
1917,II.,"As before, in the old-fashion'd manner, I fit"
1918,II.,"To this character, also, its moral: to wit,"
1919,II.,"Say--the world is a nettle; disturb it, it stings:"
1920,II.,"Grasp it firmly, it stings not.  On one of two things,"
1921,II.,"If you would not be stung, it behoves you to settle"
1922,II.,"Avoid it, or crush it.  She crush'd not the nettle;"
1923,II.,For she could not; nor would she avoid it: she tried
1924,II.,"With the weak hand of woman to thrust it aside,"
1925,II.,And it stung her.  A woman is too slight a thing
1926,II.,To trample the world without feeling its sting.

1932,III.,"One lodges but simply at Luchon; yet, thanks"
1933,III.,To the season that changes forever the banks
1934,III.,"Of the blossoming mountains, and shifts the light cloud"
1935,III.,"O'er the valley, and hushes or rouses the loud"
1936,III.,"Wind that wails in the pines, or creeps murmuring down"
1937,III.,"The dark evergreen slopes to the slumbering town,"
1938,III.,"And the torrent that falls, faintly heard from afar,"
1939,III.,"And the blue-bells that purple the dapple-gray scaur,"
1940,III.,One sees with each month of the many-faced year
1941,III.,A thousand sweet changes of beauty appear.
1942,III.,The chalet where dwelt the Comtesse de Nevers
1943,III.,"Rested half up the base of a mountain of firs,"
1944,III.,"In a garden of roses, reveal'd to the road,"
1945,III.,Yet withdrawn from its noise: 'twas a peaceful abode.
1946,III.,"And the walls, and the roofs, with their gables like hoods"
1947,III.,"Which the monks wear, were built of sweet resinous woods."
1948,III.,"The sunlight of noon, as Lord Alfred ascended"
1949,III.,"The steep garden paths, every odor had blended"
1950,III.,"Of the ardent carnations, and faint heliotropes,"
1951,III.,With the balms floated down from the dark wooded slopes:
1952,III.,"A light breeze at the window was playing about,"
1953,III.,"And the white curtains floated, now in, and now out."
1954,III.,"The house was all hush'd when he rang at the door,"
1955,III.,"Which was open'd to him in a moment, or more,"
1956,III.,"By an old nodding negress, whose sable head shined"
1957,III.,"In the sun like a cocoa-nut polished in Ind,"
1958,III.,'Neath the snowy foulard which about it was wound.

1964,IV.,"Lord Alfred sprang forward at once, with a bound."
1965,IV.,"He remembered the nurse of Lucile.  The old dame,"
1966,IV.,"Whose teeth and whose eyes used to beam when he came,"
1967,IV.,"With a boy's eager step, in the blithe days of yore,"
1968,IV.,"To pass, unannounced, her young mistress's door."
1969,IV.,The old woman had fondled Lucile on her knee
1970,IV.,"When she left, as an infant, far over the sea,"
1971,IV.,"In India, the tomb of a mother, unknown,"
1972,IV.,"To pine, a pale flow'ret, in great Paris town."
1973,IV.,"She had sooth'd the child's sobs on her breast, when she read"
1974,IV.,"The letter that told her, her father was dead."
1975,IV.,"An astute, shrewd adventurer, who, like Ulysses,"
1976,IV.,"Had studied men, cities, laws, wars, the abysses"
1977,IV.,"Of statecraft, with varying fortunes, was he."
1978,IV.,"He had wander'd the world through, by land and by sea,"
1979,IV.,"And knew it in most of its phases.  Strong will,"
1980,IV.,"Subtle tact, and soft manners, had given him skill"
1981,IV.,"To conciliate Fortune, and courage to brave"
1982,IV.,"Her displeasure.  Thrice shipwreck'd, and cast by the wave"
1983,IV.,"On his own quick resources, they rarely had fail'd"
1984,IV.,"His command: often baffled, he ever prevail'd,"
1985,IV.,In his combat with fate: to-day flatter'd and fed
1986,IV.,"By monarchs, to-morrow in search of mere bread"
1987,IV.,"The offspring of times trouble-haunted, he came"
1988,IV.,"Of a family ruin'd, yet noble in name."
1989,IV.,"He lost sight of his fortune, at twenty, in France,"
1990,IV.,"And, half statesman, half soldier, and wholly Freelance,"
1991,IV.,"Had wander'd in search of it, over the world"
1992,IV.,Into India.
1993,IV.,
1994,IV.,But scarce had the nomad unfurl'd
1995,IV.,"His wandering tent at Mysore, in the smile"
1996,IV.,"Of a Rajah (whose court he controll'd for a while,"
1997,IV.,And whose council he prompted and govern'd by stealth);
1998,IV.,"Scarce, indeed, had he wedded an Indian of wealth,"
1999,IV.,"Who died giving birth to this daughter, before"
2000,IV.,He was borne to the tomb of his wife at Mysore.
2001,IV.,"His fortune, which fell to his orphan, perchance"
2002,IV.,"Had secured her a home with his sister in France,"
2003,IV.,"A lone woman, the last of the race left.  Lucile"
2004,IV.,"Neither felt, nor affected, the wish to conceal"
2005,IV.,"The half-Eastern blood, which appear'd to bequeath"
2006,IV.,"(Reveal'd now and then, though but rarely, beneath"
2007,IV.,That outward repose that concealed it in her)
2008,IV.,A something half wild to her strange character.
2009,IV.,"The nurse with the orphan, awhile broken-hearted,"
2010,IV.,At the door of a convent in Paris had parted.
2011,IV.,"But later, once more, with her mistress she tarried,"
2012,IV.,"When the girl, by that grim maiden aunt, had been married"
2013,IV.,"To a dreary old Count, who had sullenly died,"
2014,IV.,With no claim on her tears--she had wept as a bride.
2015,IV.,"Said Lord Alfred, ""Your mistress expects me."""
2016,IV.,
2017,IV.,The crone
2018,IV.,"Oped the drawing-room door, and there left him alone."

2021,V.,V.
2022,V.,
2023,V.,
2024,V.,O'er the soft atmosphere of this temple of grace
2025,V.,Rested silence and perfume.  No sound reach'd the place.
2026,V.,In the white curtains waver'd the delicate shade
2027,V.,"Of the heaving acacias, through which the breeze play'd."
2028,V.,"O'er the smooth wooden floor, polished dark as a glass,"
2029,V.,Fragrant white Indian matting allowed you to pass.
2030,V.,"In light olive baskets, by window and door,"
2031,V.,"Some hung from the ceiling, some crowding the floor,"
2032,V.,"Rich wild flowers pluck'd by Lucile from the hill,"
2033,V.,Seem'd the room with their passionate presence to fill:
2034,V.,"Blue aconite, hid in white roses, reposed;"
2035,V.,The deep belladonna its vermeil disclosed;
2036,V.,"And the frail saponaire, and the tender blue-bell,"
2037,V.,"And the purple valerian,--each child of the fell"
2038,V.,"And the solitude flourish'd, fed fair from the source"
2039,V.,Of waters the huntsman scarce heeds in his course
2040,V.,"Where the chamois and izard, with delicate hoof,"
2041,V.,Pause or flit through the pinnacled silence aloof.
2042,V.,
2043,V.,
2044,VI.,VI.
2045,VI.,
2046,VI.,
2047,VI.,"Here you felt, by the sense of its beauty reposed,"
2048,VI.,That you stood in a shrine of sweet thoughts.  Half unclosed
2049,VI.,In the light slept the flowers; all was pure and at rest;
2050,VI.,"All peaceful; all modest; all seem'd self-possess'd,"
2051,VI.,And aware of the silence.  No vestige nor trace
2052,VI.,Of a young woman's coquetry troubled the place.
2053,VI.,He stood by the window.  A cloud pass'd the sun.
2054,VI.,"A light breeze uplifted the leaves, one by one."
2055,VI.,"Just then Lucile enter'd the room, undiscern'd"
2056,VI.,"By Lord Alfred, whose face to the window was turned,"
2057,VI.,In a strange revery.
2058,VI.,"The time was, when Lucile,"
2059,VI.,"In beholding that man, could not help but reveal"
2060,VI.,"The rapture, the fear, which wrench'd out every nerve"
2061,VI.,In the heart of the girl from the woman's reserve.
2062,VI.,"And now--she gazed at him, calm, smiling,--perchance"
2063,VI.,Indifferent.
2064,VI.,
2065,VI.,
2066,VII.,VII.
2067,VII.,
2068,VII.,
2069,VII.,"Indifferently turning his glance,"
2070,VII.,Alfred Vargrave encounter'd that gaze unaware.
2071,VII.,O'er a bodice snow-white stream'd her soft dusky hair:
2072,VII.,A rose-bud half blown in her hand; in her eyes
2073,VII.,A half-pensive smile.
2074,VII.,
2075,VII.,A sharp cry of surprise
2076,VII.,Escaped from his lips: some unknown agitation.
2077,VII.,"An invincible trouble, a strange palpitation,"
2078,VII.,Confused his ingenious and frivolous wit;
2079,VII.,"Overtook, and entangled, and paralyzed it."
2080,VII.,"That wit so complacent and docile, that ever"
2081,VII.,"Lightly came at the call of the lightest endeavor,"
2082,VII.,"Ready coin'd, and availably current as gold,"
2083,VII.,"Which, secure of its value, so fluently roll'd"
2084,VII.,In free circulation from hand on to hand
2085,VII.,"For the usage of all, at a moment's command;"
2086,VII.,"For once it rebell'd, it was mute and unstirr'd,"
2087,VII.,And he looked at Lucile without speaking a word.
2088,VII.,
2089,VII.,
2090,VIII.,VIII.
2091,VIII.,
2092,VIII.,
2093,VIII.,"Perhaps what so troubled him was, that the face"
2094,VIII.,On whose features he gazed had no more than a trace
2095,VIII.,Of the face his remembrance had imaged for years.
2096,VIII.,Yes! the face he remember'd was faded with tears:
2097,VIII.,"Grief had famish'd the figure, and dimmed the dark eyes,"
2098,VIII.,"And starved the pale lips, too acquainted with sighs,"
2099,VIII.,"And that tender, and gracious, and fond coquetterie"
2100,VIII.,Of a woman who knows her least ribbon to be
2101,VIII.,Something dear to the lips that so warmly caress
2102,VIII.,"Every sacred detail of her exquisite dress,"
2103,VIII.,In the careless toilet of Lucile--then too sad
2104,VIII.,To care aught to her changeable beauty to add--
2105,VIII.,Lord Alfred had never admired before!
2106,VIII.,"Alas! poor Lucile, in those weak days of yore,"
2107,VIII.,"Had neglected herself, never heeding, or thinking"
2108,VIII.,(While the blossom and bloom of her beauty were shrinking)
2109,VIII.,That sorrow can beautify only the heart--
2110,VIII.,Not the face--of a woman; and can but impart
2111,VIII.,Its endearment to one that has suffer'd.  In truth
2112,VIII.,Grief hath beauty for grief; but gay youth loves gay youth.

2114,VIII.,
2115,IX.,IX.
2116,IX.,
2117,IX.,
2118,IX.,"The woman that now met, unshrinking his gaze,"
2119,IX.,Seem'd to bask in the silent but sumptuous haze
2120,IX.,"Of that soft second summer, more ripe than the first,"
2121,IX.,Which returns when the bud to the blossom hath burst
2122,IX.,In despite of the stormiest April.  Lucile
2123,IX.,Had acquired that matchless unconscious appeal
2124,IX.,To the homage which none but a churl would withhold--
2125,IX.,"That caressing and exquisite grace--never bold,"
2126,IX.,Ever present--which just a few women possess.
2127,IX.,"From a healthful repose, undisturb'd by the stress"
2128,IX.,"Of unquiet emotions, her soft cheek had drawn"
2129,IX.,A freshness as pure as the twilight of dawn.
2130,IX.,"Her figure, though slight, had revived everywhere"
2131,IX.,The luxurious proportions of youth; and her hair--
2132,IX.,Once shorn as an offering to passionate love--
2133,IX.,Now floated or rested redundant above
2134,IX.,Her airy pure forehead and throat; gather'd loose
2135,IX.,"Under which, by one violet knot, the profuse"
2136,IX.,"Milk-white folds of a cool modest garment reposed,"
2137,IX.,"Rippled faint by the breast they half hid, half disclosed,"
2138,IX.,And her simple attire thus in all things reveal'd
2139,IX.,The fine art which so artfully all things conceal'd.

2143,X.,
2144,X.,
2145,X.,"Lord Alfred, who never conceived that Lucile"
2146,X.,"Could have look'd so enchanting, felt tempted to kneel"
2147,X.,"At her feet, and her pardon with passion implore;"
2148,X.,But the calm smile that met him sufficed to restore
2149,X.,The pride and the bitterness needed to meet
2150,X.,The occasion with dignity due and discreet.

2166,XI.,"""'Tis an ancient tradition,"" she answer'd, ""a tale"
2167,XI.,Often told--a position too sure to prevail
2168,XI.,"In the end of all legends of love.  If we wrote,"
2169,XI.,"When we first love, foreseeing that hour yet remote,"
2170,XI.,Wherein of necessity each would recall
2171,XI.,From the other the poor foolish records of all
2172,XI.,"Those emotions, whose pain, when recorded, seem'd bliss,"
2173,XI.,Should we write as we wrote?  But one thinks not of this!
2174,XI.,At Twenty (who does not at Twenty?) we write
2175,XI.,Believing eternal the frail vows we plight;
2176,XI.,"And we smile with a confident pity, above"
2177,XI.,The vulgar results of all poor human love:
2178,XI.,"For we deem, with that vanity common to youth,"
2179,XI.,"Because what we feel in our bosoms, in truth,"
2180,XI.,"Is novel to us--that 'tis novel to earth,"
2181,XI.,"And will prove the exception, in durance and worth,"
2182,XI.,To the great law to which all on earth must incline.
2183,XI.,"The error was noble, the vanity fine!"

2191,XII.,Lord Alfred was mute.  He remember'd her yet
2192,XII.,"A child--the weak sport of each moment's regret,"
2193,XII.,"Blindly yielding herself to the errors of life,"
2194,XII.,"The deceptions of youth, and borne down by the strife"
2195,XII.,And the tumult of passion; the tremulous toy
2196,XII.,Of each transient emotion of grief or of joy.
2197,XII.,But to watch her pronounce the death-warrant of all
2198,XII.,"The illusions of life--lift, unflinching, the pall"
2199,XII.,"From the bier of the dead Past--that woman so fair,"
2200,XII.,"And so young, yet her own self-survivor; who there"
2201,XII.,Traced her life's epitaph with a finger so cold!
2202,XII.,'Twas a picture that pain'd his self-love to behold.
2203,XII.,He himself knew--none better--the things to be said
2204,XII.,Upon subjects like this.  Yet he bow'd down his head:
2205,XII.,"And as thus, with a trouble he could not command,"
2206,XII.,"He paused, crumpling the letters he held in his hand,"
2207,XII.,"""You know me enough,"" she continued, ""or what"
2208,XII.,"I would say is, you yet recollect (do you not,"
2209,XII.,"Lord Alfred?) enough of my nature, to know"
2210,XII.,That these pledges of what was perhaps long ago
2211,XII.,"A foolish affection, I do not recall"
2212,XII.,From those motives of prudence which actuate all
2213,XII.,"Or most women when their love ceases.  Indeed,"
2214,XII.,"If you have such a doubt, to dispel it I need"
2215,XII.,But remind you that ten years these letters have rested
2216,XII.,"Unreclaim'd in your hands.""  A reproach seem'd suggested"
2217,XII.,"By these words.  To meet it, Lord Alfred look'd up"
2218,XII.,(His gaze had been fix'd on a blue Sevres cup
2219,XII.,With a look of profound connoisseurship--a smile
2220,XII.,"Of singular interest and care, all this while.)"
2221,XII.,"He look'd up, and look'd long in the face of Lucile,"
2222,XII.,To mark if that face by a sign would reveal
2223,XII.,At the thought of Miss Darcy the least jealous pain.
2224,XII.,"He look'd keenly and long, yet he look'd there in vain."
2225,XII.,"""You are generous, Madam,"" he murmur'd at last,"
2226,XII.,And into his voice a light irony pass'd.
2227,XII.,"He had look'd for reproaches, and fully arranged"

2239,XIII.,"""Do not think I abuse the occasion.  We gain"

2241,XIII.,From me not a single reproach can you hear.

2245,XIII.,"Not her selfish and often mistaken desires,"
2246,XIII.,But his interest whose fate her own interest inspires;

2263,XIV.,"His accuser, he found himself turn'd by some change,"
2264,XIV.,"As surprising and all unexpected as strange,"
2265,XIV.,To the judge from whose mercy indulgence was sought.
2266,XIV.,All the world's foolish pride in that moment was naught;

2284,XV.,"Less salient than once, less poetic, perchance,"
2285,XV.,This woman who thus had survived the romance
2286,XV.,"That had made him its hero, and breathed him its sighs,"
2287,XV.,Seem'd more charming a thousand times o'er to his eyes.
2288,XV.,Together they talk'd of the years since when last
2289,XV.,"They parted, contrasting the present, the past."
2290,XV.,Yet no memory marr'd their light converse.  Lucile
2291,XV.,"Question'd much, with the interest a sister might feel,"
2292,XV.,"Of Lord Alfred's new life,--of Miss Darcy--her face,"
2293,XV.,"Her temper, accomplishments--pausing to trace"
2294,XV.,The advantage derived from a hymen so fit.
2295,XV.,"Of herself, she recounted with humor and wit"
2296,XV.,"Her journeys, her daily employments, the lands"
2297,XV.,"She had seen, and the books she had read, and the hands"
2298,XV.,She had shaken.
2299,XV.,In all that she said there appear'd
2300,XV.,"An amiable irony.  Laughing, she rear'd"
2301,XV.,"The temple of reason, with ever a touch"
2302,XV.,"Of light scorn at her work, reveal'd only so much"
2303,XV.,"As their gleams, in the thyrsus that Bacchanals bear,"
2304,XV.,Through the blooms of a garland the point of a spear.
2305,XV.,"But above, and beneath, and beyond all of this,"
2306,XV.,"To that soul, whose experience had paralyzed bliss,"
2307,XV.,"A benignant indulgence, to all things resign'd,"
2308,XV.,"A justice, a sweetness, a meekness of mind,"
2309,XV.,"Gave a luminous beauty, as tender and faint"
2310,XV.,And serene as the halo encircling a saint.

2316,XVI.,Unobserved by Lord Alfred the time fleeted by.
2317,XVI.,To each novel sensation spontaneously
2318,XVI.,He abandon'd himself with that ardor so strange
2319,XVI.,Which belongs to a mind grown accustom'd to change.
2320,XVI.,"He sought, with well-practised and delicate art,"
2321,XVI.,To surprise from Lucile the true state of her heart;
2322,XVI.,"But his efforts were vain, and the woman, as ever,"
2323,XVI.,"More adroit than the man, baffled every endeavor."
2324,XVI.,"When he deem'd he had touch'd on some chord in her being,"
2325,XVI.,"At the touch it dissolved, and was gone.  Ever fleeing"
2326,XVI.,"As ever he near it advanced, when he thought"
2327,XVI.,"To have seized, and proceeded to analyze aught"
2328,XVI.,"Of the moral existence, the absolute soul,"
2329,XVI.,Light as vapor the phantom escaped his control.

2333,XVII.,
2334,XVII.,
2335,XVII.,"From the hall, on a sudden, a sharp ring was heard."
2336,XVII.,In the passage without a quick footstep there stirr'd;
2337,XVII.,"At the door knock'd the negress, and thrust in her head,"
2338,XVII.,"""The Duke de Luvois had just enter'd,"" she said,"
2339,XVII.,"""And insisted""--"
2340,XVII.,"""The Duke!"" cried Lucile (as she spoke,"
2341,XVII.,"The Duke's step, approaching, a light echo woke)."
2342,XVII.,"""Say I do not receive till the evening.  Explain,"""
2343,XVII.,"As she glanced at Lord Alfred, she added again,"
2344,XVII.,"""I have business of private importance."""
2345,XVII.,There came
2346,XVII.,"O'er Lord Alfred at once, at the sound of that name,"
2347,XVII.,An invincible sense of vexation.  He turn'd
2348,XVII.,"To Lucile, and he fancied he faintly discern'd"
2349,XVII.,On her face an indefinite look of confusion.
2350,XVII.,On his mind instantaneously flash'd the conclusion
2351,XVII.,That his presence had caused it.
2352,XVII.,"He said, with a sneer"
2353,XVII.,"Which he could not repress, ""Let not ME interfere"
2354,XVII.,"With the claims on your time, lady! when you are free"
2355,XVII.,"From more pleasant engagements, allow me to see"
2356,XVII.,"And to wait on you later."""
2357,XVII.,The words were not said
2358,XVII.,Ere he wish'd to recall them.  He bitterly read
2359,XVII.,The mistake he had made in Lucile's flashing eye.
2360,XVII.,"Inclining her head as in haughty reply,"
2361,XVII.,"More reproachful perchance than all utter'd rebuke,"
2362,XVII.,"She said merely, resuming her seat, ""Tell the Duke"
2363,XVII.,"He may enter."""
2364,XVII.,"And vex'd with his own words and hers,"
2365,XVII.,"Alfred Vargrave bow'd low to Lucile de Nevers,"
2366,XVII.,Pass'd the casement and enter'd the garden.  Before
2367,XVII.,His shadow was fled the Duke stood at the door.

2370,XVIII.,XVIII.
2371,XVIII.,
2372,XVIII.,
2373,XVIII.,"When left to his thoughts in the garden alone,"
2374,XVIII.,"Alfred Vargrave stood, strange to himself.  With dull tone"
2375,XVIII.,"Of importance, through cities of rose and carnation,"
2376,XVIII.,Went the bee on his business from station to station.
2377,XVIII.,The minute mirth of summer was shrill all around;
2378,XVIII.,Its incessant small voices like stings seem'd to sound
2379,XVIII.,On his sore angry sense.  He stood grieving the hot
2380,XVIII.,"Solid sun with his shadow, nor stirr'd from the spot."
2381,XVIII.,"The last look of Lucile still bewilder'd, perplex'd,"
2382,XVIII.,And reproach'd him.  The Duke's visit goaded and vex'd.
2383,XVIII.,He had not yet given the letters.  Again
2384,XVIII.,He must visit Lucile.  He resolved to remain
2385,XVIII.,"Where he was till the Duke went.  In short, he would stay,"
2386,XVIII.,Were it only to know when the Duke went away.
2387,XVIII.,"But just as he form'd this resolve, he perceived"
2388,XVIII.,"Approaching towards him, between the thick-leaved"
2389,XVIII.,"And luxuriant laurels, Lucile and the Duke."
2390,XVIII.,"Thus surprised, his first thought was to seek for some nook"
2391,XVIII.,"Whence he might, unobserved, from the garden retreat."
2392,XVIII.,They had not yet seen him.  The sound of their feet
2393,XVIII.,And their voices had warn'd him in time.  They were walking
2394,XVIII.,Towards him.  The Duke (a true Frenchman) was talking
2395,XVIII.,With the action of Talma.  He saw at a glance
2396,XVIII.,That they barr'd the sole path to the gateway.  No chance
2397,XVIII.,Of escape save in instant concealment!  Deep-dipp'd
2398,XVIII.,"In thick foliage, an arbor stood near.  In he slipp'd,"
2399,XVIII.,"Saved from sight, as in front of that ambush they pass'd,"
2400,XVIII.,Still conversing.  Beneath a laburnum at last
2401,XVIII.,"They paused, and sat down on a bench in the shade,"
2402,XVIII.,So close that he could not but hear what they said.

2413,LUVOIS.,
2414,LUVOIS.,Ah! forgive!... I desired

2416,LUVOIS.,So early last night from the ball... this whole week
2417,LUVOIS.,"I have seen you pale, silent, preoccupied... speak,"
2418,LUVOIS.,"Speak, Lucile, and forgive me!... I know that I am"
2419,LUVOIS.,"A rash fool--but I love you! I love you, Madame."
2420,LUVOIS.,"More than language can say!  Do not deem, O Lucile,"
2421,LUVOIS.,That the love I no longer have strength to conceal
2422,LUVOIS.,"Is a passing caprice!  It is strange to my nature,"
2423,LUVOIS.,"It has made me, unknown to myself, a new creature."
2424,LUVOIS.,I implore you to sanction and save the new life
2425,LUVOIS.,Which I lay at your feet with this prayer--Be my wife
2426,LUVOIS.,"Stoop, and raise me!"
2427,LUVOIS.,Lord Alfred could scarcely restrain
2428,LUVOIS.,"The sudden, acute pang of anger and pain"
2429,LUVOIS.,With which he had heard this.  As though to some wind
2430,LUVOIS.,"The leaves of the hush'd, windless laurels behind"
2431,LUVOIS.,The two thus in converse were suddenly stirr'd.
2432,LUVOIS.,The sound half betrayed him.  They started.  He heard
2433,LUVOIS.,The low voice of Lucile; but so faint was its tone
2434,LUVOIS.,That her answer escaped him.
2435,LUVOIS.,"Luvois hurried on,"
2436,LUVOIS.,As though in remonstrance with what had been spoken.
2437,LUVOIS.,"""Nay, I know it, Lucile! but your heart was not broken"
2438,LUVOIS.,By the trial in which all its fibres were proved.
2439,LUVOIS.,"Love, perchance, you mistrust, yet you need to be loved."
2440,LUVOIS.,You mistake your own feelings.  I fear you mistake
2441,LUVOIS.,"What so ill I interpret, those feelings which make"
2442,LUVOIS.,Words like these vague and feeble.  Whatever your heart
2443,LUVOIS.,"May have suffer'd of yore, this can only impart"
2444,LUVOIS.,A pity profound to the love which I feel.
2445,LUVOIS.,"Hush! hush! I know all.  Tell me nothing, Lucile."""
2446,LUVOIS.,"""You know all, Duke?"" she said; ""well then, know that, in truth,"
2447,LUVOIS.,I have learn'd from the rude lesson taught to my youth
2448,LUVOIS.,From my own heart to shelter my life; to mistrust
2449,LUVOIS.,"The heart of another.  We are what we must,"
2450,LUVOIS.,And not what we would be.  I know that one hour
2451,LUVOIS.,Assures not another.  The will and the power
2452,LUVOIS.,"Are diverse."""
2453,LUVOIS.,"""O madam!"" he answer'd, ""you fence"
2454,LUVOIS.,With a feeling you know to be true and intense.
2455,LUVOIS.,"'Tis not MY life, Lucile, that I plead for alone:"
2456,LUVOIS.,"If your nature I know, 'tis no less for your own."
2457,LUVOIS.,That nature will prey on itself; it was made
2458,LUVOIS.,"To influence others.  Consider,"" he said,"
2459,LUVOIS.,"""That genius craves power--what scope for it here?"
2460,LUVOIS.,Gifts less noble to ME give command of that sphere
2461,LUVOIS.,In which genius IS power.  Such gifts you despise?
2462,LUVOIS.,But you do not disdain what such gifts realize!
2463,LUVOIS.,"I offer you, Lady, a name not unknown--"
2464,LUVOIS.,"A fortune which worthless, without you, is grown--"

2524,XXI.,And wholly absorb'd in her thoughts she appear'd.
2525,XXI.,Her back to the window was turn'd.  As he near'd
2526,XXI.,"The sofa, her face from the glass was reflected."
2527,XXI.,"Her dark eyes were fix'd on the ground.  Pale, dejected,"
2528,XXI.,And lost in profound meditation she seem'd.
2529,XXI.,"Softly, silently, over her droop'd shoulders stream'd"
2530,XXI.,The afternoon sunlight.  The cry of alarm
2531,XXI.,"And surprise which escaped her, as now on her arm"
2532,XXI.,Alfred Vargrave let fall a hand icily cold
2533,XXI.,"And clammy as death, all too cruelly told"
2534,XXI.,How far he had been from her thoughts.

2538,XXII.,
2539,XXII.,
2540,XXII.,All his cheek

2545,XXII.,"The sentence broke short, like a weapon that snaps"
2546,XXII.,When the weight of a man is upon it.
2547,XXII.,"""Perhaps,"""
2548,XXII.,Said Lucile (her sole answer reveal'd in the flush
2549,XXII.,Of quick color which up to her brow seem'd to rush
2550,XXII.,"In reply to those few broken words), ""this farewell"
2551,XXII.,"Is our last, Alfred Vargrave, in life.  Who can tell?"
2552,XXII.,Let us part without bitterness.  Here are your letters.
2553,XXII.,"Be assured I retain you no more in my fetters!""--"
2554,XXII.,"She laughed, as she said this, a little sad laugh,"
2555,XXII.,And stretched out her hand with the letters.  And half
2556,XXII.,"Wroth to feel his wrath rise, and unable to trust"
2557,XXII.,"His own powers of restraint, in his bosom he thrust"
2558,XXII.,"The packet she gave, with a short angry sigh,"

2567,XXIII.,Far away from the heart of the woman.  Her hand
2568,XXIII.,"Droop'd, and from it, unloosed from their frail silken band,"
2569,XXIII.,"Fell those early love-letters, strewn, scatter'd, and shed"
2570,XXIII.,"At her feet--life's lost blossoms!  Dejected, her head"
2571,XXIII.,On her bosom was bow'd.  Her gaze vaguely stray'd o'er
2572,XXIII.,Those strewn records of passionate moments no more.
2573,XXIII.,From each page to her sight leapt some words that belied
2574,XXIII.,The composure with which she that day had denied

2607,II.,A wild instinct warn'd him to fly from a place

2697,VI.,"And deep in the moss gleam'd the delicate shells,"
2698,VI.,And the dew linger'd fresh in the heavy harebells;
2699,VI.,The large violet burn'd; the campanula blue;
2700,VI.,"And Autumn's own flower, the saffron, peer'd through"
2701,VI.,The red-berried brambles and thick sassafras;
2702,VI.,And fragrant with thyme was the delicate grass;
2703,VI.,"And high up, and higher, and highest of all,"
2704,VI.,The secular phantom of snow!
2705,VI.,O'er the wall
2706,VI.,"Of a gray sunless glen gaping drowsy below,"
2707,VI.,"That aerial spectre, reveal'd in the glow"
2708,VI.,"Of the great golden dawn, hovers faint on the eye"
2709,VI.,"And appears to grow in, and grow out of, the sky"
2710,VI.,"And plays with the fancy, and baffles the sight."
2711,VI.,"Only reach'd by the vast rosy ripple of light,"
2712,VI.,"And the cool star of eve, the Imperial Thing,"
2713,VI.,"Half unreal, like some mythological king"

2715,VI.,Takes command of a valley as fair to behold
2716,VI.,"As aught in old fables; and, seen or unseen,"
2717,VI.,"Dwells aloof over all, in the vast and serene"
2718,VI.,"Sacred sky, where the footsteps of spirits are furl'd"
2719,VI.,'Mid the clouds beyond which spreads the infinite world

2729,VII.,A gay cavalcade some few feet in advance.
2730,VII.,Alfred Vargrave's heart beat; for he saw at a glance
2731,VII.,The slight form of Lucile in the midst.  His next look
2732,VII.,"Show'd him, joyously ambling beside her, the Duke"
2733,VII.,The rest of the troop which had thus caught his ken
2734,VII.,"He knew not, nor noticed them (women and men)."
2735,VII.,They were laughing and talking together.  Soon after

2745,VIII.,"""But since MY way would seem to be YOURS, let me ride"

2757,IX.,"The Duke had observed it, nor quitted her side,"
2758,IX.,"For even one moment, the whole of the ride."
2759,IX.,"Alfred smiled, as he thought, ""he is jealous of her!"""
2760,IX.,And the thought of this jealousy added a spur
2761,IX.,To his firm resolution and effort to please.

2770,X.,"The air changed and chill'd.  As though out of the ground,"
2771,X.,"There ran up the trees a confused hissing sound,"
2772,X.,"And the wind rose.  The guides sniff'd, like chamois, the air,"
2773,X.,"And look'd at each other, and halted, and there"
2774,X.,Unbuckled the cloaks from the saddles.  The white
2775,X.,"Aspens rustled, and turn'd up their frail leaves in fright."
2776,X.,All announced the approach of the tempest.
2777,X.,"Erelong,"
2778,X.,"Thick darkness descended the mountains among,"
2779,X.,"And a vivid, vindictive, and serpentine flash"
2780,X.,"Gored the darkness, and shore it across with a gash."
2781,X.,The rain fell in large heavy drops.  And anon
2782,X.,Broke the thunder.
2783,X.,"The horses took fright, every one."
2784,X.,The Duke's in a moment was far out of sight.
2785,X.,The guides whoop'd.  The band was obliged to alight;
2786,X.,"And, dispersed up the perilous pathway, walk'd blind"

2794,XI.,He fills
2795,XI.,The crouch'd hollows and all the oracular hills
2796,XI.,With dread voices of power.  A roused million or more
2797,XI.,Of wild echoes reluctantly rise from their hoar
2798,XI.,"Immemorial ambush, and roll in the wake"
2799,XI.,"Of the cloud, whose reflection leaves vivid the lake."
2800,XI.,"And the wind, that wild robber, for plunder descends"
2801,XI.,"From invisible lands, o'er those black mountain ends;"
2802,XI.,He howls as he hounds down his prey; and his lash
2803,XI.,"Tears the hair of the timorous wan mountain-ash,"
2804,XI.,"That clings to the rocks, with her garments all torn,"
2805,XI.,Like a woman in fear; then he blows his hoarse horn
2806,XI.,"And is off, the fierce guide of destruction and terror,"
2807,XI.,"Up the desolate heights, 'mid an intricate error"

2816,XII.,O'er those sharp splinter'd rocks that are gleaming below
2817,XII.,"In the soft light, so fair and so fatal, as though"
2818,XII.,"Some seraph burn'd through them, the thunderbolt searching"
2819,XII.,Which the black cloud unbosom'd just now.  Lo! the lurching
2820,XII.,"And shivering pine-trees, like phantoms, that seem"
2821,XII.,"To waver above, in the dark; and yon stream,"
2822,XII.,"How it hurries and roars, on its way to the white"

2829,XIII.,
2830,XIII.,Through the darkness and awe
2831,XIII.,"That had gather'd around him, Lord Alfred now saw,"
2832,XIII.,Reveal'd in the fierce and evanishing glare
2833,XIII.,Of the lightning that momently pulsed through the air
2834,XIII.,"A woman alone on a shelf of the hill,"
2835,XIII.,"With her cheek coldly propp'd on her hand,--and as still"
2836,XIII.,"As the rock that she sat on, which beetled above"
2837,XIII.,The black lake beneath her.
2838,XIII.,"All terror, all love"
2839,XIII.,Added speed to the instinct with which he rush'd on.
2840,XIII.,For one moment the blue lightning swathed the whole stone
2841,XIII.,In its lurid embrace: like the sleek dazzling snake
2842,XIII.,"That encircles a sorceress, charm'd for her sake"
2843,XIII.,"And lull'd by her loveliness; fawning, it play'd"
2844,XIII.,And caressingly twined round the feet and the head
2845,XIII.,"Of the woman who sat there, undaunted and calm"
2846,XIII.,"As the soul of that solitude, listing the psalm"
2847,XIII.,Of the plangent and laboring tempests roll slow
2848,XIII.,From the caldron of midnight and vapor below.
2849,XIII.,"Next moment from bastion to bastion, all round,"
2850,XIII.,"Of the siege-circled mountains, there tumbled the sound"
2851,XIII.,"Of the battering thunder's indefinite peal,"
2852,XIII.,And Lord Alfred had sprung to the feet of Lucile.

2856,XIV.,
2857,XIV.,
2858,XIV.,"She started.  Once more, with its flickering wand,"

2861,XIV.,"The light fingers, that coldly and lingeringly dwelt"
2862,XIV.,"In the grasp of his own, tremble faintly."
2863,XIV.,"""See! see!"
2864,XIV.,"Where the whirlwind hath stricken and strangled yon tree!"""
2865,XIV.,"She exclaim'd,... ""like the passion that brings on its breath,"

2867,XIV.,"Alfred Vargrave, the lightning is round you!"""
2868,XIV.,"""Lucile!"
2869,XIV.,I hear--I see--naught but yourself.  I can feel
2870,XIV.,Nothing here but your presence.  My pride fights in vain

2917,XVI.,"And most hallow'd--the duty most sacred and sweet,"

2929,XVI.,"I have wearily wander'd the world, and I feel"

2984,XVIII.,"But the Duke, who was agile, had leap'd to a stone,"
2985,XVIII.,"And the horse, being bred to the instinct which fills"
2986,XVIII.,"The breast of the wild mountaineer in these hills,"

3464,X.,"It was sombre and silent, and suited his mood."
3465,X.,"By a mineral spring, long unused, now unknown,"
3466,X.,"Stood a small ruin'd abbey.  He reach'd it, sat down"

3474,XI.,"In re-reading that letter, there roll'd from his mind"
3475,XI.,The raw mist of resentment which first made him blind
3476,XI.,"To the pathos breath'd through it.  Tears rose in his eyes,"
3477,XI.,And a hope sweet and strange in his heart seem'd to rise.
3478,XI.,The truth which he saw not the first time he read
3479,XI.,"That letter, he now saw--that each word betray'd"
3480,XI.,The love which the writer had sought to conceal.
3481,XI.,"His love was received not, he could not but feel,"
3482,XI.,"For one reason alone,--that his love was not free."
3483,XI.,True! free yet he was not: but could he not be
3484,XI.,"Free erelong, free as air to revoke that farewell,"
3485,XI.,And to sanction his own hopes? he had but to tell
3486,XI.,"The truth to Matilda, and she were the first"
3487,XI.,To release him: he had but to wait at the worst.
3488,XI.,Matilda's relations would probably snatch
3489,XI.,"Any pretext, with pleasure, to break off a match"
3490,XI.,"In which they had yielded, alone at the whim"
3491,XI.,"Of their spoil'd child, a languid approval to him."
3492,XI.,"She herself, careless child! was her love for him aught"
3493,XI.,Save the first joyous fancy succeeding the thought
3494,XI.,She last gave to her doll? was she able to feel
3495,XI.,Such a love as the love he divined in Lucile?
3496,XI.,"He would seek her, obtain his release, and, oh! then"
3497,XI.,"He had but to fly to Lucile, and again"
3498,XI.,Claim the love which his heart would be free to command.
3499,XI.,"But to press on Lucile any claim to her hand,"
3500,XI.,"Or even to seek, or to see, her before"
3501,XI.,"He could say, ""I am free! free, Lucile, to implore"
3502,XI.,"That great blessing on life you alone can confer,"""
3503,XI.,"'Twere dishonor in him, 'twould be insult to her."
3504,XI.,Thus still with the letter outspread on his knee
3505,XI.,"He follow'd so fondly his own revery,"
3506,XI.,That he felt not the angry regard of a man
3507,XI.,Fix'd upon him; he saw not a face stern and wan
3508,XI.,Turn'd towards him; he heard not a footstep that pass'd
3509,XI.,"And repass'd the lone spot where he stood, till at last"
3510,XI.,A hoarse voice aroused him.

3521,XII.,"To ""the doubtless sublime reveries his intrusion"
3522,XII.,"Had, he fear'd, interrupted.  Milord would do better,"

3531,XIII.,It was obvious to Alfred the Frenchman was bent
3532,XIII.,Upon picking a quarrel! and doubtless 'twas meant
3533,XIII.,From HIM to provoke it by sneers such as these.
3534,XIII.,A moment sufficed his quick instinct to seize
3535,XIII.,The position.  He felt that he could not expose
3536,XIII.,"His own name, or Lucile's, or Matilda's, to those"
3537,XIII.,Idle tongues that would bring down upon him the ban
3538,XIII.,"Of the world, if he now were to fight with this man."
3539,XIII.,"And indeed, when he look'd in the Duke's haggard face,"
3540,XIII.,He was pain'd by the change there he could not but trace.
3541,XIII.,And he almost felt pity.
3542,XIII.,He therefore put by
3543,XIII.,"Each remark from the Duke with some careless reply,"
3544,XIII.,"And coldly, but courteously, waving away"

3554,XIV.,And said...
3555,XIV.,"""Hold, Lord Alfred!  Away with disguise!"
3556,XIV.,"I will own that I sought you, a moment ago,"
3557,XIV.,To fix on you a quarrel.  I still can do so

3889,II.,You watch them whirl'd down by the torrent.
3890,II.,"In truth,"
3891,II.,To the sacred political creed of his youth
3892,II.,The century which he was born to denied
3893,II.,All realization.  Its generous pride
3894,II.,To degenerate protest on all things was sunk;
3895,II.,Its principles each to a prejudice shrunk.
3896,II.,"Down the path of a life that led nowhere he trod,"
3897,II.,"Where his whims were his guides, and his will was his god,"
3898,II.,And his pastime his purpose.
3899,II.,From boyhood possess'd
3900,II.,"Of inherited wealth, he had learned to invest"
3901,II.,Both his wealth and those passions wealth frees from the cage
3902,II.,"Which penury locks, in each vice of an age"
3903,II.,"All the virtues of which, by the creed he revered,"
3904,II.,Were to him illegitimate.
3905,II.,"Thus, he appear'd"
3906,II.,"To the world what the world chose to have him appear,--"
3907,II.,"The frivolous tyrant of Fashion, a mere"
3908,II.,"Reformer in coats, cards, and carriages!  Still"
3909,II.,"'Twas the vigor of nature, and tension of will,"
3910,II.,That found for the first time--perhaps for the last--
3911,II.,"In Lucile what they lacked yet to free from the Past,"
3912,II.,"Force, and faith, in the Future."
3913,II.,"And so, in his mind,"
3914,II.,To the anguish of losing the woman was join'd
3915,II.,"The terror of missing his life's destination,"
3916,II.,Which in her had its mystical representation.
3917,II.,
3918,II.,
3919,III.,III.
3920,III.,
3921,III.,
3922,III.,"And truly, the thought of it, scaring him, pass'd"
3923,III.,"O'er his heart, while he now through the twilight rode fast"
3924,III.,As a shade from the wing of some great bird obscene
3925,III.,"In a wide silent land may be suddenly seen,"
3926,III.,"Darkening over the sands, where it startles and scares"
3927,III.,"Some traveller stray'd in the waste unawares,"
3928,III.,So that thought more than once darken'd over his heart
3929,III.,"For a moment, and rapidly seem'd to depart."
3930,III.,Fast and furious he rode through the thickets which rose
3931,III.,Up the shaggy hillside: and the quarrelling crows
3932,III.,"Clang'd above him, and clustering down the dim air"
3933,III.,Dropp'd into the dark woods.  By fits here and there
3934,III.,"Shepherd fires faintly gleam'd from the valleys.  Oh, how"
3935,III.,"He envied the wings of each wild bird, as now"
3936,III.,He urged the steed over the dizzy ascent
3937,III.,Of the mountain!  Behind him a murmur was sent
3938,III.,From the torrent--before him a sound from the tracts
3939,III.,"Of the woodlands that waved o'er the wild cataracts,"
3940,III.,And the loose earth and loose stones roll'd momently down
3941,III.,From the hoofs of his steed to abysses unknown.
3942,III.,"The red day had fallen beneath the black woods,"
3943,III.,And the Powers of the night through the vast solitudes
3944,III.,Walk'd abroad and conversed with each other.  The trees
3945,III.,"Were in sound and in motion, and mutter'd like seas"
3946,III.,In Elfland.  The road through the forest was hollow'd.
3947,III.,"On he sped through the darkness, as though he were follow'd"
3948,III.,"Fast, fast by the Erl King!"
3949,III.,The wild wizard-work
3950,III.,"Of the forest at last open'd sharp, o'er the fork"
3951,III.,"Of a savage ravine, and behind the black stems"
3952,III.,"Of the last trees, whose leaves in the light gleam'd like gems,"
3953,III.,Broke the broad moon above the voluminous
3954,III.,"Rock-chaos,--the Hecate of that Tartarus!"
3955,III.,"With his horse reeking white, he at last reach'd the door"
3956,III.,"Of a small mountain inn, on the brow of a hoar"
3957,III.,"Craggy promontory, o'er a fissure as grim,"
3958,III.,"Through which, ever roaring, there leap'd o'er the limb"
3959,III.,"Of the rent rock a torrent of water, from sight,"
3960,III.,Into pools that were feeding the roots of the night.
3961,III.,A balcony hung o'er the water.  Above
3962,III.,In a glimmering casement a shade seem'd to move.
3963,III.,At the door the old negress was nodding her head
3964,III.,"As he reach'd it.  ""My mistress awaits you,"" she said."
3965,III.,And up the rude stairway of creeking pine rafter
3966,III.,"He follow'd her silent.  A few moments after,"
3967,III.,"His heart almost stunned him, his head seem'd to reel,"
3968,III.,For a door closed--Luvois was alone with Lucile.

3975,IV.,"Streaming o'er it, and tossed now and then by the wind"
3976,IV.,"From the lattice, that waved the dull flame in a spire"
3977,IV.,From a brass lamp before her--a faint hectic fire
3978,IV.,"On her cheek, to her eyes lent the lustre of fever:"
3979,IV.,"They seem'd to have wept themselves wider than ever,"

4016,LUCILE.,"See!... what,"
4017,LUCILE.,"What word, do you ask?  Every word! would you not,"
4018,LUCILE.,"Had I taken your hand thus, have felt that your name"
4019,LUCILE.,Was soil'd and dishonor'd by more than mere shame
4020,LUCILE.,If the woman that bore it had first been the cause

4022,LUCILE.,"Woman's honor, you ask?  Is there, sir, no dishonor"
4023,LUCILE.,"In the smile of a woman, when men, gazing on her,"
4024,LUCILE.,"Can shudder, and say, ""In that smile is a grave""?"
4025,LUCILE.,"No! you can have no cause, Duke, for no right you have"
4026,LUCILE.,In the contest you menace.  That contest but draws
4027,LUCILE.,Every right into ruin.  By all human laws

4034,LUCILE.,"When you saw that I hoped, to extinguish hope quite."

4038,LUCILE.,This sudden reproach seem'd to startle.
4039,LUCILE.,She raised
4040,LUCILE.,"A slow, wistful regard to his features, and gazed"

4042,LUCILE.,"Through her heart, whence its first wild alarm was now pass'd,"

4049,LUCILE.,Too self-conscious to lose all in love?  Had she deem'd
4050,LUCILE.,"That this airy, gay, insolent man of the world,"
4051,LUCILE.,"So proud of the place the world gave him, held furl'd"
4052,LUCILE.,In his bosom no passion which once shaken wide
4053,LUCILE.,"Might tug, till it snapped, that erect lofty pride?"
4054,LUCILE.,"Were those elements in him, which once roused to strife"
4055,LUCILE.,"Overthrow a whole nature, and change a whole life?"
4056,LUCILE.,"There are two kinds of strength.  One, the strength of the river"
4057,LUCILE.,Which through continents pushes its pathway forever
4058,LUCILE.,To fling its fond heart in the sea; if it lose
4059,LUCILE.,"This, the aim of its life, it is lost to its use,"
4060,LUCILE.,"It goes mad, is diffused into deluge, and dies."
4061,LUCILE.,"The other, the strength of the sea; which supplies"
4062,LUCILE.,"Its deep life from mysterious sources, and draws"
4063,LUCILE.,"The river's life into its own life, by laws"
4064,LUCILE.,Which it heeds not.  The difference in each case is this:
4065,LUCILE.,"The river is lost, if the ocean it miss;"
4066,LUCILE.,"If the sea miss the river, what matter?  The sea"
4067,LUCILE.,"Is the sea still, forever.  Its deep heart will be"
4068,LUCILE.,"Self-sufficing, unconscious of loss as of yore;"
4069,LUCILE.,"Its sources are infinite; still to the shore,"
4070,LUCILE.,"With no diminution of pride, it will say,"
4071,LUCILE.,"""I am here; I, the sea! stand aside, and make way!"""

4088,V.,"At a moment in life when I felt most alone,"
4089,V.,"And least able to be so? a moment, in fact,"

4289,X.,That the night had divided his whole life in two.
4290,X.,Behind him a past that was over forever:
4291,X.,Before him a future devoid of endeavor
4292,X.,"And purpose.  He felt a remorse for the one,"
4293,X.,Of the other a fear.  What remain'd to be done?
4294,X.,"Whither now should he turn?  Turn again, as before,"
4295,X.,"To his old easy, careless existence of yore"
4296,X.,He could not.  He felt that for better or worse
4297,X.,A change had pass'd o'er him; an angry remorse
4298,X.,Of his own frantic failure and error had marr'd
4299,X.,Such a refuge forever.  The future seem'd barr'd
4300,X.,By the corpse of a dead hope o'er which he must tread
4301,X.,"To attain it.  Life's wilderness round him was spread,"
4302,X.,What clew there to cling by?
4303,X.,He clung by a name
4304,X.,To a dynasty fallen forever.  He came
4305,X.,"Of an old princely house, true through change to the race"
4306,X.,And the sword of Saint Louis--a faith 'twere disgrace
4307,X.,"To relinquish, and folly to live for!  Nor less"
4308,X.,Was his ancient religion (once potent to bless
4309,X.,Or to ban; and the crozier his ancestors kneel'd
4310,X.,"To adore, when they fought for the Cross, in hard field"
4311,X.,"With the Crescent) become, ere it reach'd him, tradition;"
4312,X.,A mere faded badge of a social position;
4313,X.,"A thing to retain and say nothing about,"
4314,X.,"Lest, if used, it should draw degradation from doubt."
4315,X.,"Thus, the first time he sought them, the creeds of his youth"
4316,X.,"Wholly fail'd the strong needs of his manhood, in truth!"
4317,X.,"And beyond them, what region of refuge? what field"
4318,X.,"For employment, this civilized age, did it yield,"
4319,X.,In that civilized land? or to thought? or to action?
4320,X.,"Blind deliriums, bewilder'd and endless distraction!"
4321,X.,"Not even a desert, not even the cell"
4322,X.,"Of a hermit to flee to, wherein he might quell"
4323,X.,"The wild devil-instincts which now, unreprest,"
4324,X.,Ran riot through that ruin'd world in his breast.
4325,X.,
4326,X.,
4327,XI.,XI.
4328,XI.,
4329,XI.,
4330,XI.,"So he lay there, like Lucifer, fresh from the sight"
4331,XI.,Of a heaven scaled and lost; in the wide arms of night
4332,XI.,O'er the howling abysses of nothingness!  There
4333,XI.,"As he lay, Nature's deep voice was teaching him prayer;"
4334,XI.,But what had he to pray to?
4335,XI.,"The winds in the woods,"
4336,XI.,"The voices abroad o'er those vast solitudes,"
4337,XI.,Were in commune all round with the invisible
4338,XI.,Power that walk'd the dim world by Himself at that hour.
4339,XI.,But their language he had not yet learn'd--in despite
4340,XI.,"Of the much he HAD learn'd--or forgotten it quite,"
4341,XI.,With its once native accents.  Alas! what had he
4342,XI.,To add to that deep-toned sublime symphony
4343,XI.,Of thanksgiving?...  A fiery finger was still
4344,XI.,"Scorching into his heart some dread sentence.  His will,"
4345,XI.,"Like a wind that is put to no purpose, was wild"
4346,XI.,At its work of destruction within him.  The child
4347,XI.,"Of an infidel age, he had been his own god,"
4348,XI.,His own devil.
4349,XI.,"He sat on the damp mountain sod,"
4350,XI.,and stared sullenly up at the dark sky.
4351,XI.,The clouds
4352,XI.,Had heap'd themselves over the bare west in crowds
4353,XI.,"Of misshapen, incongruous potents.  A green"
4354,XI.,"Streak of dreary, cold, luminous ether, between"
4355,XI.,"The base of their black barricades, and the ridge"
4356,XI.,"Of the grim world, gleam'd ghastly, as under some bridge,"
4357,XI.,"Cyclop-sized, in a city of ruins o'erthrown"
4358,XI.,"By sieges forgotten, some river, unknown"
4359,XI.,"And unnamed, widens on into desolate lands."
4360,XI.,"While he gazed, that cloud-city invisible hands"
4361,XI.,"Dismantled and rent; and reveal'd, through a loop"
4362,XI.,"In the breach'd dark, the blemish'd and half-broken hoop"
4363,XI.,"Of the moon, which soon silently sank; and anon"
4364,XI.,The whole supernatural pageant was gone.
4365,XI.,"The wide night, discomforted, conscious of loss,"
4366,XI.,Darken'd round him.  One object alone--that gray cross--
4367,XI.,"Glimmer'd faint on the dark.  Gazing up, he descried,"
4368,XI.,"Through the void air, its desolate arms outstretch'd, wide,"
4369,XI.,As though to embrace him.
4370,XI.,"He turn'd from the sight,"
4371,XI.,"Set his face to the darkness, and fled."
4372,XI.,
4373,XI.,
4374,XII.,XII.
4375,XII.,
4376,XII.,
4377,XII.,When the light
4378,XII.,Of the dawn grayly flicker'd and glared on the spent
4379,XII.,"Wearied ends of the night, like a hope that is sent"
4380,XII.,"To the need of some grief when its need is the sorest,"
4381,XII.,He was sullenly riding across the dark forest
4382,XII.,Toward Luchon.
4383,XII.,"Thus riding, with eyes of defiance"
4384,XII.,"Set against the young day, as disclaiming alliance"
4385,XII.,"With aught that the day brings to man, he perceived"
4386,XII.,"Faintly, suddenly, fleetingly, through the damp-leaved"
4387,XII.,"Autumn branches that put forth gaunt arms on his way,"
4388,XII.,"The face of a man pale and wistful, and gray"
4389,XII.,"With the gray glare of morning.  Eugene de Luvois,"
4390,XII.,"With the sense of a strange second sight, when he saw"
4391,XII.,"That phantom-like face, could at once recognize,"
4392,XII.,"By the sole instinct now left to guide him, the eyes"
4393,XII.,"Of his rival, though fleeting the vision and dim,"
4394,XII.,"With a stern sad inquiry fix'd keenly on him,"
4395,XII.,"And, to meet it, a lie leap'd at once to his own;"
4396,XII.,A lie born of that lying darkness now grown
4397,XII.,Over all in his nature!  He answer'd that gaze
4398,XII.,"With a look which, if ever a man's look conveys"
4399,XII.,More intensely than words what a man means convey'd
4400,XII.,"Beyond doubt in its smile an announcement which said,"
4401,XII.,"""I have triumph'd.  The question your eyes would imply"
4402,XII.,"Comes too late, Alfred Vargrave!"""
4403,XII.,"And so he rode by,"
4404,XII.,"And rode on, and rode gayly, and rode out of sight,"
4405,XII.,Leaving that look behind him to rankle and bite.
4406,XII.,
4407,XII.,
4408,XIII.,XIII.
4409,XIII.,
4410,XIII.,
4411,XIII.,"And it bit, and it rankled."
4412,XIII.,
4413,XIII.,
4414,XIV.,XIV.
4415,XIV.,
4416,XIV.,
4417,XIV.,"Lord Alfred, scarce knowing,"
4418,XIV.,"Or choosing, or heeding the way he was going,"
4419,XIV.,"By one wild hope impell'd, by one wild fear pursued,"
4420,XIV.,"And led by one instinct, which seem'd to exclude"
4421,XIV.,"From his mind every human sensation, save one"
4422,XIV.,"The torture of doubt--had stray'd moodily on,"
4423,XIV.,"Down the highway deserted, that evening in which"
4424,XIV.,"With the Duke he had parted; stray'd on, through rich"
4425,XIV.,"Haze of sunset, or into the gradual night,"
4426,XIV.,"Which darken'd, unnoticed, the land from his sight,"
4427,XIV.,Toward Saint Saviour; nor did the changed aspect of all
4428,XIV.,The wild scenery around him avail to recall
4429,XIV.,"To his senses their normal perceptions, until,"
4430,XIV.,As he stood on the black shaggy brow of the hill
4431,XIV.,"At the mouth of the forest, the moon, which had hung"
4432,XIV.,"Two dark hours in a cloud, slipp'd on fire from among"
4433,XIV.,"The rent vapors, and sunk o'er the ridge of the world."
4434,XIV.,"Then he lifted his eyes, and saw round him unfurl'd,"
4435,XIV.,"In one moment of splendor, the leagues of dark trees,"
4436,XIV.,And the long rocky line of the wild Pyrenees.
4437,XIV.,And he knew by the milestone scored rough on the face
4438,XIV.,"Of the bare rock, he was but two hours from the place"
4439,XIV.,Where Lucile and Luvois must have met.  This same track
4440,XIV.,"The Duke must have traversed, perforce, to get back"
4441,XIV.,To Luchon; not yet then the Duke had returned!
4442,XIV.,"He listen'd, he look'd up the dark, but discern'd"
4443,XIV.,"Not a trace, not a sound of a horse by the way."
4444,XIV.,He knew that the night was approaching to day.
4445,XIV.,"He resolved to proceed to Saint Saviour.  The morn,"
4446,XIV.,"Which, at last, through the forest broke chill and forlorn,"
4447,XIV.,"Reveal'd to him, riding toward Luchon, the Duke."
4448,XIV.,'Twas then that the two men exchanged look for look.
4449,XIV.,
4450,XIV.,
4451,XV.,XV.
4452,XV.,
4453,XV.,
4454,XV.,And the Duke's rankled in him.
4455,XV.,
4456,XV.,
4457,XVI.,XVI.
4458,XVI.,
4459,XVI.,
4460,XVI.,He rush'd on.  He tore
4461,XVI.,"His path through the thicket.  He reach'd the inn door,"
4462,XVI.,"Roused the yet drowsing porter, reluctant to rise,"
4463,XVI.,"And inquired for the Countess.  The man rubb'd his eyes,"
4464,XVI.,The Countess was gone.  And the Duke?
4465,XVI.,The man stared
4466,XVI.,A sleepy inquiry.
4467,XVI.,With accents that scared
4468,XVI.,"The man's dull sense awake, ""He, the stranger,"" he cried,"
4469,XVI.,"""Who had been there that night!"""
4470,XVI.,"The man grinn'd and replied,"
4471,XVI.,"With a vacant intelligence, ""He, oh ay, ay!"
4472,XVI.,"He went after the lady."""
4473,XVI.,No further reply
4474,XVI.,"Could he give.  Alfred Vargrave demanded no more,"
4475,XVI.,"Flung a coin to the man, and so turn'd from the door."
4476,XVI.,"""What! the Duke, then, the night in that lone inn had pass'd?"
4477,XVI.,"In that lone inn--with her!""  Was that look he had cast"
4478,XVI.,"When they met in the forest, that look which remain'd"
4479,XVI.,"On his mind with its terrible smile, thus explain'd?"
4480,XVI.,
4481,XVI.,
4482,XVII.,XVII.
4483,XVII.,
4484,XVII.,
4485,XVII.,"The day was half turn'd to the evening, before"
4486,XVII.,"He re-entered Luchon, with a heart sick and sore."
4487,XVII.,"In the midst of a light crowd of babblers, his look,"
4488,XVII.,"By their voices attracted, distinguished the Duke,"
4489,XVII.,"Gay, insolent, noisy, with eyes sparkling bright,"
4490,XVII.,"With laughter, shrill, airy, continuous."
4491,XVII.,Right
4492,XVII.,"Through the throng Alfred Vargrave, with swift sombre stride,"
4493,XVII.,"Glided on.  The Duke noticed him, turn'd, stepp'd aside,"
4494,XVII.,"And, cordially grasping his hand, whisper'd low,"
4495,XVII.,"""O, how right have you been!  There can never be--no,"
4496,XVII.,"Never--any more contest between us!  Milord,"
4497,XVII.,"Let us henceforth be friends!"""
4498,XVII.,"Having utter'd that word,"
4499,XVII.,"He turn'd lightly round on his heel, and again"
4500,XVII.,"His gay laughter was heard, echoed loud by that train"
4501,XVII.,Of his young imitators.
4502,XVII.,"Lord Alfred stood still,"
4503,XVII.,"Rooted, stunn'd, to the spot.  He felt weary and ill,"
4504,XVII.,"Out of heart with his own heart, and sick to the soul"
4505,XVII.,"With a dull, stifling anguish he could not control."
4506,XVII.,"Does he hear in a dream, through the buzz of the crowd,"
4507,XVII.,"The Duke's blithe associates, babbling aloud"
4508,XVII.,Some comment upon his gay humor that day?
4509,XVII.,He never was gayer: what makes him so gay?
4510,XVII.,"'Tis, no doubt, say the flatterers, flattering in tune,"
4511,XVII.,Some vestal whose virtue no tongue dare impugn
4512,XVII.,"Has at last found a Mars--who, of course, shall be nameless,"
4513,XVII.,That vestal that yields to Mars ONLY is blameless!
4514,XVII.,"Hark! hears he a name which, thus syllabled, stirs"
4515,XVII.,All his heart into tumult?... Lucile de Nevers
4516,XVII.,"With the Duke's coupled gayly, in some laughing, light,"
4517,XVII.,Free allusion?  Not so as might give him the right
4518,XVII.,"To turn fiercely round on the speaker, but yet"
4519,XVII.,To a trite and irreverent compliment set!

4521,XVII.,
4522,XVIII.,XVIII.
4523,XVIII.,
4524,XVIII.,
4525,XVIII.,"Slowly, slowly, usurping that place in his soul"
4526,XVIII.,"Where the thought of Lucile was enshrined, did there roll"

4560,XX.,"From the gate, in the courtyard, and ready to start,"
4561,XX.,"Postboys mounted, portmanteaus packed up and made fast,"

4563,XX.,He order'd his horse to be ready anon:
4564,XX.,"Sent, and paid, for the reckoning, and slowly pass'd on,"
4565,XX.,"And ascended the staircase, and enter'd his room."
4566,XX.,It was twilight.  The chamber was dark in the gloom
4567,XX.,Of the evening.  He listlessly kindled a light
4568,XX.,On the mantel-piece; there a large card caught his sight--
4569,XX.,"A large card, a stout card, well-printed and plain,"
4570,XX.,"Nothing flourishing, flimsy, affected, or vain."
4571,XX.,It gave a respectable look to the slab
4572,XX.,That it lay on.  The name was--
4573,XX.,
4574,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.
4575,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,
4576,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,"Full familiar to him was the name that he saw,"
4577,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,For 'twas that of his own future uncle-in-law.
4578,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,"Mrs. Darcy's rich brother, the banker, well known"
4579,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,As wearing the longest philacteried gown
4580,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,"Of all the rich Pharisees England can boast of,"
4581,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,"A shrewd Puritan Scot, whose sharp wits made the most of"
4582,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,This world and the next; having largely invested

4584,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,"By thieves, moth, or rust; but on this earthly ball"
4585,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,"Where interest was high, and security small."
4586,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,Of mankind there was never a theory yet

4588,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,And so to that sorrowful verse of the Psalm
4589,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,Which declares that the wicked expand like the palm
4590,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,"In a world where the righteous are stunted and pent,"
4591,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,A cheering exception did Ridley present.
4592,SIR RIDLEY MACNAB.,"Like the worthy of Uz, Heaven prosper'd his piety."

4605,XXI.,"""Sir Ridley MacNab with Milord wish'd to speak."""
4606,XXI.,Alfred Vargrave could feel there were tears on his cheek;
4607,XXI.,He brushed them away with a gesture of pride.
4608,XXI.,"He glanced at the glass; when his own face he eyed,"
4609,XXI.,"He was scared by its pallor.  Inclining his head,"
4610,XXI.,"He with tones calm, unshaken, and silvery, said,"
4611,XXI.,"""Sir Ridley may enter."""
4612,XXI.,In three minutes more
4613,XXI.,That benign apparition appeared at the door.
4614,XXI.,"Sir Ridley, released for a while from the cares"
4615,XXI.,"Of business, and minded to breathe the pure airs"
4616,XXI.,"Of the blue Pyrenees, and enjoy his release,"
4617,XXI.,"In company there with his sister and niece,"
4618,XXI.,"Found himself now at Luchon--distributing tracts,"
4619,XXI.,"Sowing seed by the way, and collecting new facts"
4620,XXI.,For Exeter Hall; he was starting that night
4621,XXI.,"For Bigorre: he had heard, to his cordial delight,"
4622,XXI.,"That Lord Alfred was there, and, himself, setting out"
4623,XXI.,"For the same destination: impatient, no doubt!"
4624,XXI.,"Here some commonplace compliments as to ""the marriage"
4625,XXI.,"Through his speech trickled softly, like honey: his carriage"
4626,XXI.,Was ready.  A storm seem'd to threaten the weather;
4627,XXI.,"If his young friend agreed, why not travel together?"
4628,XXI.,"With a footstep uncertain and restless, a frown"
4629,XXI.,"Of perplexity, during this speech, up and down"
4630,XXI.,"Alfred Vargrave was striding; but, after a pause"
4631,XXI.,"And a slight hesitation, the which seem'd to cause"
4632,XXI.,"Some surprise to Sir Ridley, he answer'd--""My dear"
4633,XXI.,"Sir Ridley, allow me a few moments here--"
4634,XXI.,Half an hour at the most--to conclude an affair
4635,XXI.,Of a nature so urgent as hardly to spare
4636,XXI.,"My presence (which brought me, indeed, to this spot),"
4637,XXI.,"Before I accept your kind offer."""
4638,XXI.,"""Why not?"""
4639,XXI.,"Said Sir Ridley, and smiled.  Alfred Vargrave, before"
4640,XXI.,"Sir Ridley observed it, had pass'd through the door."
4641,XXI.,"A few moments later, with footsteps revealing"
4642,XXI.,"Intense agitation of uncontroll'd feeling,"
4643,XXI.,He was rapidly pacing the garden below.
4644,XXI.,What pass'd through his mind then is more than I know.
4645,XXI.,"But before one half-hour into darkness had fled,"
4646,XXI.,In the courtyard he stood with Sir Ridley.  His tread
4647,XXI.,Was firm and composed.  Not a sign on his face
4648,XXI.,"Betrayed there the least agitation.  ""The place"
4649,XXI.,"You so kindly have offer'd,"" he said, ""I accept."""
4650,XXI.,And he stretch'd out his hand.  The two travellers stepp'd
4651,XXI.,Smiling into the carriage.
4652,XXI.,"And thus, out of sight,"
4653,XXI.,"They drove down the dark road, and into the night."
4654,XXI.,

4656,XXII.,XXII.
4657,XXII.,
4658,XXII.,
4659,XXII.,"Sir Ridley was one of those wise men who, so far"

4661,XXII.,"""We, no doubt, are the people, and wisdom shall die with us!"""
4662,XXII.,Though of wisdom like theirs there is no small supply with us.
4663,XXII.,"Side by side in the carriage ensconced, the two men"
4664,XXII.,"Began to converse somewhat drowsily, when"
4665,XXII.,"Alfred suddenly thought--""Here's a man of ripe age,"
4666,XXII.,"At my side, by his fellows reputed as sage,"
4667,XXII.,"Who looks happy, and therefore who must have been wise;"
4668,XXII.,Suppose I with caution reveal to his eyes
4669,XXII.,Some few of the reasons which make me believe
4670,XXII.,That I neither am happy nor wise? 'twould relieve
4671,XXII.,"And enlighten, perchance, my own darkness and doubt."""
4672,XXII.,For which purpose a feeler he softly put out.
4673,XXII.,It was snapp'd up at once.
4674,XXII.,"""What is truth? ""jesting Pilate"
4675,XXII.,"Ask'd, and pass'd from the question at once with a smile at"
4676,XXII.,Its utter futility.  Had he address'd it

4678,XXII.,Admitted discussion! and certainly no man
4679,XXII.,Could more promptly have answer'd the sceptical Roman
4680,XXII.,Than Ridley.  Hear some street astronomer talk!
4681,XXII.,"Grant him two or three hearers, a morsel of chalk,"
4682,XXII.,And forthwith on the pavement he'll sketch you the scheme
4683,XXII.,Of the heavens.  Then hear him enlarge on his theme!

4685,XXII.,He'll prove you the whole plan in plain A B C.
4686,XXII.,Here's your sun--call him A; B's the moon; it is clear

4688,XXII.,"Of the planets.  Now ask Arago, ask La Place,"
4689,XXII.,"(Your sages, who speak with the heavens face to face!)"
4690,XXII.,Their science in plain A B C to accord

4693,XXII.,Not a drop from the bottle that's quite full will pass.
4694,XXII.,'Tis the half-empty vessel that freest emits
4695,XXII.,The water that's in it.  'Tis thus with men's wits;
4696,XXII.,Or at least with their knowledge.  A man's capability
4697,XXII.,Of imparting to others a truth with facility
4698,XXII.,Is proportion'd forever with painful exactness
4699,XXII.,"To the portable nature, the vulgar compactness,"
4700,XXII.,"The minuteness in size, or the lightness in weight,"
4701,XXII.,Of the truth he imparts.  So small coins circulate
4702,XXII.,"More freely than large ones.  A beggar asks alms,"
4703,XXII.,"And we fling him a sixpence, nor feel any qualms;"
4704,XXII.,"But if every street charity shook an investment,"
4705,XXII.,"Or each beggar to clothe we must strip off a vestment,"
4706,XXII.,The length of the process would limit the act;
4707,XXII.,And therefore the truth that's summ'd up in a tract
4708,XXII.,Is most lightly dispensed.
4709,XXII.,"As for Alfred, indeed,"
4710,XXII.,On what spoonfuls of truth he was suffer'd to feed
4711,XXII.,"By Sir Ridley, I know not.  This only I know,"
4712,XXII.,That the two men thus talking continued to go

4726,XXIII.,"In the smile of the East.  And the lark soaring on,"
4727,XXIII.,"Lost in light, shook the dawn with a song from the sun."
4728,XXIII.,And the world laugh'd.
4729,XXIII.,It wanted but two rosy hours
4730,XXIII.,"From the noon, when they pass'd through the thick passion flowers"
4731,XXIII.,Of the little wild garden that dimpled before
4732,XXIII.,The small house where their carriage now stopp'd at Bigorre.
4733,XXIII.,"And more fair than the flowers, more fresh than the dew,"
4734,XXIII.,With her white morning robe flitting joyously through

4738,XXIII.,"Of such sunny sweetness, such gladness, such grace,"
4739,XXIII.,"And radiant confidence, childlike delight,"
4740,XXIII.,That his whole heart upbraided itself at that sight.
4741,XXIII.,"And he murmur'd, or sigh'd, ""O, how could I have stray'd"
4742,XXIII.,"From this sweet child, or suffer'd in aught to invade"
4743,XXIII.,"Her young claim on my life, though it were for an hour,"

5033,IV.,"Alfred Vargrave, in wedding with beauty and youth,"

5108,VI.,In each other some sign they expected to find
5109,VI.,Of a something unnamed in the heart or the mind;

5197,X.,"Every time that he laugh'd I observed that he sigh'd,"
5198,X.,As though vex'd to be pleased.  I remark'd that he sat
5199,X.,"Ill at ease on his seat, and kept twirling his hat"
5200,X.,"In his hand, with a look of unquiet abstraction."
5201,X.,I inquired the cause of his dissatisfaction.
5202,X.,"""Sir,"" he said, ""if what vexes me here you would know,"

5210,X.,The lady I love tete-a-tete with a friend
5211,X.,In a box out of reach at the opposite end:
5212,X.,Then the crowd push'd me out.  What was left me to do?
5213,X.,I tried for the tragedy... que voulez-vous?

5304,XIV.,"The idler from England, the idler from France,"

5306,XIV.,"An acquaintance at Ems is to most men a treasure,"

5308,XIV.,One discourteous remembrance of things pass'd away.
5309,XIV.,"'Twas a sight that was pleasant, indeed, to be seen,"
5310,XIV.,These friends exchange greetings;--the men who had been
5311,XIV.,Foes so nearly in days that were past.
5312,XIV.,"This, no doubt,"
5313,XIV.,"Is why, on the night I am speaking about,"
5314,XIV.,"My Lord Alfred sat down by himself at roulette,"
5315,XIV.,"Without one suspicion his bosom to fret,"
5316,XIV.,"Although he had left, with his pleasant French friend,"

5323,XV.,Lord Alfred his combat with Fortune began
5324,XV.,With a few modest thalers--away they all ran--
5325,XV.,The reserve follow'd fast in the rear.  As his purse
5326,XV.,Grew lighter his spirits grew sensibly worse.
5327,XV.,One needs not a Bacon to find a cause for it:
5328,XV.,'Tis an old law in physics--Natura abhorret

5332,XV.,On that day of all days when an empire was wreck'd
5333,XV.,"On thy plain, Waterloo, and he witness'd the last"
5334,XV.,"Of his favorite Guard cut to pieces, aghast!"
5335,XV.,"Just then Alfred felt, he could scarcely tell why,"
5336,XV.,Within him the sudden strange sense that some eye
5337,XV.,"Had long been intently regarding him there,--"
5338,XV.,That some gaze was upon him too searching to bear.
5339,XV.,He rose and look'd up.  Was it fact?  Was it fable?
5340,XV.,"Was it dream?  Was it waking?  Across the green table,"
5341,XV.,"That face, with its features so fatally known--"
5342,XV.,"Those eyes, whose deep gaze answer'd strangely his own"

5344,XV.,"Some cheat of a feverish, fanciful brain?"

5358,XVI.,"The brief noon of beauty was passing away,"

5364,XVI.,"From the warmth of a whisper, the glance of an eye,"

5368,XVI.,"A strange sort of faint-footed fear,--like a mouse"
5369,XVI.,"That comes out, when 'tis dark, in some old ducal house"

5373,XVI.,"In Rome,--in the Forum,--there open'd one night"

5375,XVI.,In this omen the anger of Heaven they read.
5376,XVI.,Men consulted the gods: then the oracle said:--
5377,XVI.,"""Ever open this gulf shall endure, till at last"
5378,XVI.,"That which Rome hath most precious within it be cast."""
5379,XVI.,"The Romans threw in it their corn and their stuff,"
5380,XVI.,But the gulf yawn'd as wide.  Rome seem'd likely enough
5381,XVI.,To be ruin'd ere this rent in her heart she could choke.
5382,XVI.,"Then Curtius, revering the oracle, spoke:"
5383,XVI.,"""O Quirites! to this Heaven's question is come:"
5384,XVI.,"What to Rome is most precious?  The manhood of Rome."""
5385,XVI.,"He plunged, and the gulf closed."
5386,XVI.,The tale is not new;
5387,XVI.,"But the moral applies many ways, and is true."
5388,XVI.,"How, for hearts rent in twain, shall the curse be destroy'd?"
5389,XVI.,'Tis a warm human one that must fill up the void.

5411,XVII.,From the woman's fair fame it in naught could detract:
5412,XVII.,'Twas the woman's free genius it vex'd and attack'd
5413,XVII.,With a sneer at her freedom of action and speech.
5414,XVII.,"But its light careless cavils, in truth, could not reach"
5415,XVII.,The lone heart they aim'd at.  Her tears fell beyond
5416,XVII.,"The world's limit, to feel that the world could respond"
5417,XVII.,"To that heart's deepest, innermost yearning, in naught,"
5418,XVII.,'Twas no longer this earth's idle inmates she sought:
5419,XVII.,The wit of the woman sufficed to engage
5420,XVII.,In the woman's gay court the first men of the age.
5421,XVII.,"Some had genius; and all, wealth of mind to confer"

5427,XVII.,Genius touches the world at but one point alone
5428,XVII.,"Of that spacious circumference, never quite known"
5429,XVII.,To the world; all the infinite number of lines
5430,XVII.,"That radiate thither a mere point combines,"
5431,XVII.,"But one only,--some central affection apart"
5432,XVII.,"From the reach of the world, in which Genius is Heart,"
5433,XVII.,"And love, life's fine centre, includes heart and mind,"
5434,XVII.,And therefore it was that Lucile sigh'd to find
5435,XVII.,"Men of genius appear, one and all in her ken,"
5436,XVII.,"When they stoop'd themselves to it, as mere clever men;"
5437,XVII.,"Artists, statesmen, and they in whose works are unfurl'd"
5438,XVII.,"Worlds new-fashioned for man, as mere men of the world."
5439,XVII.,"And so, as alone now she stood, in the sight"
5440,XVII.,"Of the sunset of youth, with her face from the light,"
5441,XVII.,"And watch'd her own shadow grow long at her feet,"
5442,XVII.,"As though stretch'd out, the shade of some OTHER to meet,"
5443,XVII.,The woman felt homeless and childless: in scorn
5444,XVII.,She seem'd mock'd by the voices of children unborn;
5445,XVII.,And when from these sombre reflections away
5446,XVII.,"She turn'd, with a sigh, to that gay world, more gay"
5447,XVII.,"For her presence within it, she knew herself friendless;"
5448,XVII.,"That her path led from peace, and that path appear'd endless!"
5449,XVII.,"That even her beauty had been but a snare,"
5450,XVII.,And her wit sharpen'd only the edge of despair.

5454,XVIII.,
5455,XVIII.,
5456,XVIII.,"With a face all transfigured and flush'd by surprise,"
5457,XVIII.,Alfred turn'd to Lucile.  With those deep searching eyes
5458,XVIII.,"She look'd into his own.  Not a word that she said,"
5459,XVIII.,"Not a look, not a blush, one emotion betray'd."
5460,XVIII.,"She seem'd to smile through him, at something beyond:"
5461,XVIII.,"When she answer'd his questions, she seem'd to respond"
5462,XVIII.,"To some voice in herself.  With no trouble descried,"
5463,XVIII.,To each troubled inquiry she calmly replied.
5464,XVIII.,Not so he.  At the sight of that face back again
5465,XVIII.,"To his mind came the ghost of a long-stifled pain,"
5466,XVIII.,"A remember'd resentment, half check'd by a wild"
5467,XVIII.,And relentful regret like a motherless child
5468,XVIII.,"Softly seeking admittance, with plaintive appeal,"
5469,XVIII.,To the heart which resisted its entrance.
5470,XVIII.,Lucile
5471,XVIII.,"And himself thus, however, with freedom allow'd"
5472,XVIII.,"To old friends, talking still side by side, left the crowd"
5473,XVIII.,"By the crowd unobserved.  Not unnoticed, however,"
5474,XVIII.,By the Duke and Matilda.  Matilda had never
5475,XVIII.,Seen her husband's new friend.
5476,XVIII.,"She had follow'd by chance,"
5477,XVIII.,"Or by instinct, the sudden half-menacing glance"
5478,XVIII.,"Which the Duke, when he witness'd their meeting, had turn'd"
5479,XVIII.,"On Lucile and Lord Alfred; and, scared, she discern'd"
5480,XVIII.,On his feature the shade of a gloom so profound
5481,XVIII.,That she shudder'd instinctively.  Deaf to the sound
5482,XVIII.,"Of her voice, to some startled inquiry of hers"
5483,XVIII.,"He replied not, but murmur'd, ""Lucile de Nevers"
5484,XVIII.,"Once again then? so be it!""  In the mind of that man,"
5485,XVIII.,"At that moment, there shaped itself vaguely the plan"
5486,XVIII.,"Of a purpose malignant and dark, such alone"
5487,XVIII.,(To his own secret heart but imperfectly shown)
5488,XVIII.,"As could spring from the cloudy, fierce chaos of thought"
5489,XVIII.,By which all his nature to tumult was wrought.

5493,XIX.,
5494,XIX.,
5495,XIX.,"""So!"" he thought, ""they meet thus: and reweave the old charm!"
5496,XIX.,"And she hangs on his voice, and she leans on his arm,"
5497,XIX.,"And she heeds me not, seeks me not, recks not of me!"
5498,XIX.,"Oh, what if I show'd her that I, too, can be"
5499,XIX.,"Loved by one--her own rival--more fair and more young?"""
5500,XIX.,"The serpent rose in him; a serpent which, stung,"
5501,XIX.,Sought to sting.
5502,XIX.,"Each unconscious, indeed, of the eye"
5503,XIX.,"Fix'd upon them, Lucile and my lord saunter'd by,"
5504,XIX.,In converse which seem'd to be earnest.  A smile
5505,XIX.,Now and then seem'd to show where their thoughts touch'd.  Meanwhile
5506,XIX.,"The muse of this story, convinced that they need her,"
5507,XIX.,"To the Duke and Matilda returns, gentle Reader."

5513,XX.,The Duke with that sort of aggressive false praise
5514,XX.,Which is meant a resentful remonstrance to raise
5515,XX.,"From a listener (as sometimes a judge, just before"
5516,XX.,"He pulls down the black cap, very gently goes o'er"
5517,XX.,"The case for the prisoner, and deals tenderly"
5518,XX.,"With the man he is minded to hang by and by),"
5519,XX.,"Had referr'd to Lucile, and then stopp'd to detect"
5520,XX.,In the face of Matilda the growing effect
5521,XX.,Of the words he had dropp'd.  There's no weapon that slays
5522,XX.,Its victim so surely (if well aim'd) as praise.
5523,XX.,"Thus, a pause on their converse had fallen: and now"
5524,XX.,"Each was silent, preoccupied; thoughtful."
5525,XX.,You know
5526,XX.,"There are moments when silence, prolong'd and unbroken,"
5527,XX.,More expressive may be than all words ever spoken.
5528,XX.,It is when the heart has an instinct of what
5529,XX.,In the heart of another is passing.  And that
5530,XX.,"In the heart of Matilda, what was it?  Whence came"
5531,XX.,To her cheek on a sudden that tremulous flame?
5532,XX.,What weighed down her head?
5533,XX.,All your eye could discover
5534,XX.,Was the fact that Matilda was troubled.  Moreover
5535,XX.,That trouble the Duke's presence seem'd to renew.
5536,XX.,"She, however, broke silence, the first of the two."
5537,XX.,The Duke was too prudent to shatter the spell
5538,XX.,Of a silence which suited his purpose so well.
5539,XX.,She was plucking the leaves from a pale blush rose blossom
5540,XX.,Which had fall'n from the nosegay she wore in her bosom.
5541,XX.,"""This poor flower,"" she said, ""seems it not out of place"
5542,XX.,"In this hot, lamplit air, with its fresh, fragile grace?"""
5543,XX.,She bent her head low as she spoke.  With a smile
5544,XX.,"The Duke watch'd her caressing the leaves all the while,"
5545,XX.,And continued on his side the silence.  He knew
5546,XX.,This would force his companion their talk to renew
5547,XX.,At the point that he wish'd; and Matilda divined
5548,XX.,The significant pause with new trouble of mind.
5549,XX.,She lifted one moment her head; but her look
5550,XX.,"Encounter'd the ardent regard of the Duke,"
5551,XX.,"And dropp'd back on her flowret abash'd.  Then, still seeking"
5552,XX.,"The assurance she fancied she show'd him by speaking,"
5553,XX.,She conceived herself safe in adopting again
5554,XX.,The theme she should most have avoided just then.

5572,MATILDA.,MATILDA.
5573,MATILDA.,
5574,MATILDA.,"Yes, yes! you described her, I know,"
5575,MATILDA.,As possess'd of a charm all unrivall'd.
5576,MATILDA.,
5577,LUVOIS.,LUVOIS.
5578,LUVOIS.,
5579,LUVOIS.,Alas!
5580,LUVOIS.,"You mistook me completely!  You, madam, surpass"

5597,LUVOIS.,"She broke in, all more fair for one innocent blush."
5598,LUVOIS.,"""Between man and woman these things differ so!"
5599,LUVOIS.,It may be that the world pardons... (how should I know?)
5600,LUVOIS.,"In you what it visits on us; or 'tis true,"
5601,LUVOIS.,"It may be that we women are better than you."""
5602,LUVOIS.,
5603,LUVOIS.,LUVOIS.
5604,LUVOIS.,
5605,LUVOIS.,"Who denies it?  Yet, madam, once more you mistake."
5606,LUVOIS.,"The world, in its judgment, some difference may make"
5607,LUVOIS.,"'Twixt the man and the woman, so far as respects"
5608,LUVOIS.,Its social enchantments; but not as affects

5614,MATILDA.,That may be.  Yet I think I should be less severe.
5615,MATILDA.,"Although so inexperienced in such things, I fear"
5616,MATILDA.,I have learn'd that the heart cannot always repress
5617,MATILDA.,Or account for the feelings which sway it.
5618,MATILDA.,"""Yes! yes!"
5619,MATILDA.,"That is too true, indeed!""... the Duke sigh'd."
5620,MATILDA.,And again
5621,MATILDA.,For one moment in silence continued the twain.

5625,XXII.,
5626,XXII.,
5627,XXII.,"At length the Duke slowly, as though he had needed"

5634,XXII.,"With a quick change of tone,"

5651,XXIII.,
5652,XXIII.,
5653,XXIII.,He look'd at her--paused--felt if thus far
5654,XXIII.,"The ground held yet.  The ardor with which he had spoken,"
5655,XXIII.,"This close, rapid question, thus suddenly broken,"
5656,XXIII.,"Inspired in Matilda a vague sense of fear,"
5657,XXIII.,As though some indefinite danger were near.
5658,XXIII.,"With composure, however, at once she replied:--"
5659,XXIII.,"""'Tis three years since the day when I first was a bride,"
5660,XXIII.,And my husband I never had cause to suspect;
5661,XXIII.,"Nor ever have stoop'd, sir, such cause to detect."
5662,XXIII.,Yet if in his looks or his acts I should see--
5663,XXIII.,"See, or fancy--some moment's oblivion of me,"
5664,XXIII.,"I trust that I too should forget it,--for you"
5665,XXIII.,"Must have seen that my heart is my husband's."""
5666,XXIII.,The hue
5667,XXIII.,"On her cheek, with the effort wherewith to the Duke"
5668,XXIII.,"She had uttered this vague and half-frightened rebuke,"
5669,XXIII.,Was white as the rose in her hand.  The last word
5670,XXIII.,"Seem'd to die on her lip, and could scarcely be heard."
5671,XXIII.,There was silence again.
5672,XXIII.,A great step had been made
5673,XXIII.,By the Duke in the words he that evening had said.
5674,XXIII.,"There, half drown'd by the music, Matilda, that night,"
5675,XXIII.,"Had listen'd--long listen'd--no doubt, in despite"
5676,XXIII.,"Of herself, to a voice she should never have heard,"
5677,XXIII.,And her heart by that voice had been troubled and stirr'd.
5678,XXIII.,And so having suffer'd in silence his eye
5679,XXIII.,"To fathom her own, he resumed, with a sigh:"
5680,XXIII.,
5681,XXIII.,
5682,XXIV.,XXIV.
5683,XXIV.,
5684,XXIV.,
5685,XXIV.,"""Will you suffer me, lady, your thoughts to invade"
5686,XXIV.,"By disclosing my own?  The position,"" he said,"
5687,XXIV.,"""In which we so strangely seem placed may excuse"
5688,XXIV.,The frankness and force of the words which I use.
5689,XXIV.,You say that your heart is your husband's: You say
5690,XXIV.,"That you love him.  You think so, of course, lady... nay,"
5691,XXIV.,"Such a love, I admit, were a merit, no doubt."
5692,XXIV.,"But, trust me, no true love there can be without"
5693,XXIV.,Its dread penalty--jealousy.
5694,XXIV.,"""Well, do not start!"
5695,XXIV.,"Until now,--either thanks to a singular art"
5696,XXIV.,"Of supreme self-control, you have held them all down"
5697,XXIV.,"Unreveal'd in your heart,--or you never have known"
5698,XXIV.,Even one of those fierce irresistible pangs
5699,XXIV.,Which deep passion engenders; that anguish which hangs
5700,XXIV.,"On the heart like a nightmare, by jealousy bred."
5701,XXIV.,"But if, lady, the love you describe, in the bed"
5702,XXIV.,Of a blissful security thus hath reposed
5703,XXIV.,"Undisturb'd, with mild eyelids on happiness closed,"
5704,XXIV.,"Were it not to expose to a peril unjust,"
5705,XXIV.,"And most cruel, that happy repose you so trust,"
5706,XXIV.,"To meet, to receive, and, indeed, it may be,"
5707,XXIV.,"For how long I know not, continue to see"
5708,XXIV.,A woman whose place rivals yours in the life
5709,XXIV.,"And the heart which not only your title of wife,"
5710,XXIV.,"But also (forgive me!) your beauty alone,"
5711,XXIV.,"Should have made wholly yours?--You, who gave all your own!"
5712,XXIV.,Reflect!--'tis the peace of existence you stake
5713,XXIV.,On the turn of a die.  And for whose--for his sake?
5714,XXIV.,"While you witness this woman, the false point of view"
5715,XXIV.,From which she must now be regarded by you
5716,XXIV.,"Will exaggerate to you, whatever they be,"
5717,XXIV.,The charms I admit she possesses.  To me
5718,XXIV.,"They are trivial indeed; yet to your eyes, I fear"
5719,XXIV.,"And foresee, they will true and intrinsic appear."
5720,XXIV.,"Self-unconscious, and sweetly unable to guess"
5721,XXIV.,"How more lovely by far is the grace you possess,"
5722,XXIV.,"You will wrong your own beauty.  The graces of art,"
5723,XXIV.,You will take for the natural charm of the heart;
5724,XXIV.,"Studied manners, the brilliant and bold repartee,"
5725,XXIV.,Will too soon in that fatal comparison be
5726,XXIV.,To your fancy more fair than the sweet timid sense
5727,XXIV.,"Which, in shrinking, betrays its own best eloquence."
5728,XXIV.,"O then, lady, then, you will feel in your heart"
5729,XXIV.,The poisonous pain of a fierce jealous dart!
5730,XXIV.,"While you see her, yourself you no longer will see,--"
5731,XXIV.,"You will hear her, and hear not yourself,--you will be"
5732,XXIV.,"Unhappy; unhappy, because you will deem"
5733,XXIV.,Your own power less great than her power will seem.
5734,XXIV.,"And I shall not be by your side, day by day,"
5735,XXIV.,"In despite of your noble displeasure, to say"
5736,XXIV.,"'You are fairer than she, as the star is more fair"

5745,XXV.,Still she spoke with what calmness she could--
5746,XXV.,"""Sir, the while"
5747,XXV.,"I thank you,"" she said, with a faint scornful smile,"
5748,XXV.,"""For your fervor in painting my fancied distress:"

5763,XXV.,"""I forgot that you know me so slightly.  Your leave"

5836,XXVIII.,"And Matilda, repressing with effort the strife"

5839,XXVIII.,"Which betoken'd a distant defiance, replied"
5840,XXVIII.,"To Lucile's startled cry, as surprised she descried"

5844,XXVIII.,"Or resolved not to notice the half-frighten'd glance,"
5845,XXVIII.,That follow'd that movement.
5846,XXVIII.,The Duke to his feet

5850,XXVIII.,"Of Lucile's gracious tact was by every one felt,"

6338,II.,This is just the advice I myself would have given
6339,II.,"To Lord Alfred, had I been his cousin, which, Heaven"
6340,II.,"Be praised, I am not.  But it reach'd him indeed"
6341,II.,"In an unlucky hour, and received little heed."
6342,II.,A half-languid glance was the most that he lent at
6343,II.,That time to these homilies.  Primum dementat
6344,II.,Quem Deus vult perdere.  Alfred in fact
6345,II.,Was behaving just then in a way to distract
6346,II.,Job's self had Job known him.  The more you'd have thought
6347,II.,"The Duke's court to Matilda his eye would have caught,"
6348,II.,"The more did his aspect grow listless to hers,"
6349,II.,And the more did it beam to Lucile de Nevers.
6350,II.,"And Matilda, the less she found love in the look"
6351,II.,"Of her husband, the less did she shrink from the Duke."
6352,II.,"With each day that pass'd o'er them, they each, heart from heart,"
6353,II.,Woke to feel themselves further and further apart.
6354,II.,More and more of his time Alfred pass'd at the table;
6355,II.,Played high; and lost more than to lose he was able.
6356,II.,"He grew feverish, querulous, absent, perverse,--"
6357,II.,"And here I must mention, what made matters worse,"
6358,II.,That Lucile and the Duke at the selfsame hotel
6359,II.,With the Vargraves resided.  It needs not to tell
6360,II.,That they all saw too much of each other.  The weather
6361,II.,Was so fine that it brought them each day all together
6362,II.,"In the garden, to listen, of course, to the band."
6363,II.,The house was a sort of phalanstery; and
6364,II.,Lucile and Matilda were pleased to discover
6365,II.,"A mutual passion for music.  Moreover,"
6366,II.,The Duke was an excellent tenor; could sing
6367,II.,"""Ange si pure"" in a way to bring down on the wing"
6368,II.,All the angels St. Cicely play'd to.  My lord
6369,II.,"Would also, at times, when he was not too bored,"
6370,II.,"Play Beethoven, and Wagner's new music, not ill;"
6371,II.,"With some little things of his own, showing skill."
6372,II.,"For which reason, as well as for some others too,"
6373,II.,Their rooms were a pleasant enough rendezvous.
6374,II.,"Did Lucile, then, encourage (the heartless coquette!)"
6375,II.,All the mischief she could not but mark?
6376,II.,Patience yet!

6381,III.,"In that garden, an arbor, withdrawn from the sun,"
6382,III.,"By laburnum and lilac with blooms overrun,"
6383,III.,"Form'd a vault of cool verdure, which made, when the heat"
6384,III.,"Of the noontide hung heavy, a gracious retreat."
6385,III.,"And here, with some friends of their own little world,"
6386,III.,"In the warm afternoons, till the shadows uncurl'd"
6387,III.,"From the feet of the lindens, and crept through the grass,"
6388,III.,Their blue hours would this gay little colony pass.
6389,III.,"The men loved to smoke, and the women to bring,"
6390,III.,"Undeterr'd by tobacco, their work there, and sing"
6391,III.,"Or converse, till the dew fell, and homeward the bee"
6392,III.,"Floated, heavy with honey.  Towards eve there was tea"
6393,III.,"(A luxury due to Matilda), and ice,"
6394,III.,Fruit and coffee.  [Greek text omitted]!
6395,III.,"Such an evening it was, while Matilda presided"
6396,III.,"O'er the rustic arrangements thus daily provided,"
6397,III.,"With the Duke, and a small German Prince with a thick head,"
6398,III.,"And an old Russian Countess both witty and wicked,"
6399,III.,"And two Austrian Colonels,--that Alfred, who yet"
6400,III.,"Was lounging alone with his last cigarette,"
6401,III.,Saw Lucile de Nevers by herself pacing slow
6402,III.,"'Neath the shade of the cool linden-trees to and fro,"
6403,III.,"And joining her, cried, ""Thank the good stars, we meet!"
6404,III.,"I have so much to say to you!"""
6405,III.,"""Yes?... ""with her sweet"
6406,III.,"Serene voice, she replied to him.... ""Yes? and I too"

6409,III.,Of her voice had within it a sadness profound.
6410,III.,"""You are ill?"" he exclaim'd."
6411,III.,"""No!"" she hurriedly said."
6412,III.,"""No, no!"""
6413,III.,"""You alarm me!"""
6414,III.,She droop'd down her head.
6415,III.,"""If your thoughts have of late sought, or cared, to divine"

6456,ALFRED.,"Nay, nay, interrupt me not yet! let it be!"
6457,ALFRED.,"I but say what is due to yourself--due to me,"

6465,ALFRED.,"""When my life was defrauded of you, but to take"

6469,ALFRED.,I have striven.  One word of unkindness has never

6472,ALFRED.,"I have fail'd to renew what I felt in my youth,"
6473,ALFRED.,"I at least have been loyal to what I DO feel,"

6480,ALFRED.,"""Alas!"""
6481,ALFRED.,"She replied, ""for one moment, perchance, did it pass"

6483,ALFRED.,To those who indulge it in innocent thought
6484,ALFRED.,So fatal an evil awaking!  But no.
6485,ALFRED.,"For in lives such as ours are, the Dream-tree would grow"
6486,ALFRED.,"On the borders of Hades: beyond it, what lies?"
6487,ALFRED.,"The wheel of Ixion, alas! and the cries"
6488,ALFRED.,"Of the lost and tormented.  Departed, for us,"
6489,ALFRED.,Are the days when with innocence we could discuss
6490,ALFRED.,"Dreams like these.  Fled, indeed, are the dreams of my life!"
6491,ALFRED.,"Oh trust me, the best friend you have is your wife."
6492,ALFRED.,"And I--in that pure child's pure virtue, I bow"
6493,ALFRED.,To the beauty of virtue.  I felt on my brow
6494,ALFRED.,Not one blush when I first took her hand.  With no blush
6495,ALFRED.,"Shall I clasp it to-night, when I leave you."
6496,ALFRED.,"""Hush! hush!"
6497,ALFRED.,I would say what I wish'd to have said when you came.
6498,ALFRED.,Do not think that years leave us and find us the same!
6499,ALFRED.,"The woman you knew long ago, long ago,"
6500,ALFRED.,"Is no more.  You yourself have within you, I know,"
6501,ALFRED.,"The germ of a joy in the years yet to be,"
6502,ALFRED.,"Whereby the past years will bear fruit.  As for me,"
6503,ALFRED.,"I go my own way,--onward, upward!"
6504,ALFRED.,"""O yet,"
6505,ALFRED.,Let me thank you for that which ennobled regret
6506,ALFRED.,"When it came, as it beautified hope ere it fled,--"
6507,ALFRED.,"The love I once felt for you.  True, it is dead,"
6508,ALFRED.,But it is not corrupted.  I too have at last
6509,ALFRED.,"Lived to learn that love is not--such love as is past,"
6510,ALFRED.,Such love as youth dreams of at least--the sole part

6512,ALFRED.,Even that of a woman.

7088,XII.,"The moon,"
7089,XII.,"Bright, breathless, and buoyant, and brimful of June,"
7090,XII.,"Floated up from the hillside, sloped over the vale,"

7094,XII.,Thus to each of those women revealing the face

7097,XII.,The cheek of Matilda had flooded with flame.
7098,XII.,"With her enthusiastic emotion, Lucile"
7099,XII.,Trembled visibly yet; for she could not but feel
7100,XII.,"That a heavenly hand was upon her that night,"

7116,XII.,"Not the absence of love, but the ignorance how"

7118,XII.,"Your heart worthy of love,--since it knows how to love."""

7126,XIII.,"Sigh'd Matilda, and lifted her eyes to the face"
7127,XIII.,Of Lucile.
7128,XIII.,There pass'd suddenly through it the trace
7129,XIII.,Of deep sadness; and o'er that fair forehead came down
7130,XIII.,A shadow which yet was too sweet for a frown.
7131,XIII.,"""The pupil of sorrow, perchance,""... she replied."
7132,XIII.,"""Of sorrow?"" Matilda exclaim'd... ""O confide"

7150,XIV.,"Of a lamp of pure white alabaster, aloft"
7151,XIV.,"From the ceiling suspended, around it slept soft."
7152,XIV.,The casement oped into the garden.  The pale
7153,XIV.,Cool moonlight stream'd through it.  One lone nightingale
7154,XIV.,"Sung aloof in the laurels.  And here, side by side,"
7155,XIV.,"Hand in hand, the two women sat down undescried,"
7156,XIV.,Save by guardian angels.
7157,XIV.,"As when, sparkling yet"
7158,XIV.,"From the rain, that, with drops that are jewels, leaves wet"
7159,XIV.,"The bright head it humbles, a young rose inclines"
7160,XIV.,"To some pale lily near it, the fair vision shines"
7161,XIV.,"As one flower with two faces, in hush'd, tearful speech,"
7162,XIV.,"Like the showery whispers of flowers, each to each"
7163,XIV.,"Link'd, and leaning together, so loving, so fair,"
7164,XIV.,"So united, yet diverse, the two women there"
7165,XIV.,"Look'd, indeed, like two flowers upon one drooping stem,"
7166,XIV.,In the soft light that tenderly rested on them.
7167,XIV.,"All that soul said to soul in that chamber, who knows?"
7168,XIV.,All that heart gain'd from heart?
7169,XIV.,"Leave the lily, the rose,"
7170,XIV.,Undisturb'd with their secret within them.  For who
7171,XIV.,To the heart of the floweret can follow the dew?
7172,XIV.,"A night full of stars!  O'er the silence, unseen,"
7173,XIV.,The footsteps of sentinel angels between
7174,XIV.,The dark land and deep sky were moving.  You heard
7175,XIV.,Pass'd from earth up to heaven the happy watchword

7455,JOHN.,"As I could, my dear Alfred?*"
7456,JOHN.,
7457,JOHN.,
7458,JOHN.,"*These events, it is needless to say, Mr. Morse,"
7459,JOHN.,Took place when Bad News as yet travell'd by horse;
7460,JOHN.,"Ere the world, like a cockchafer, buzz'd on a wire,"
7461,JOHN.,Or Time was calcined by electrical fire;
7462,JOHN.,"Ere a cable went under the hoary Atlantic,"
7463,JOHN.,Or the word Telegram drove grammarians frantic.
7464,JOHN.,
7465,JOHN.,
7466,VI.,VI.
7467,VI.,
7468,VI.,
7469,VI.,"He stopp'd here, aghast"
7470,VI.,"At the change in his cousin, the hue of whose face"
7471,VI.,Had grown livid; and glassy his eyes fix'd on space.
7472,VI.,"""Courage, courage!""... said John,... ""bear the blow like a man!"""
7473,VI.,And he caught the cold hand of Lord Alfred.  There ran
7474,VI.,"Through that hand a quick tremor.  ""I bear it,"" he said,"
7475,VI.,"""But Matilda? the blow is to her!""  And his head"
7476,VI.,"Seem'd forced down, as he said it."
7477,VI.,
7478,JOHN.,JOHN.
7479,JOHN.,
7480,JOHN.,"Matilda?  Pooh, pooh!"
7481,JOHN.,I half think I know the girl better than you.
7482,JOHN.,She has courage enough--and to spare.  She cares less
7483,JOHN.,"Than most women for luxury, nonsense, and dress."
7484,JOHN.,
7485,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
7486,ALFRED.,
7487,ALFRED.,The fault has been mine.
7488,ALFRED.,
7489,JOHN.,JOHN.
7490,JOHN.,
7491,JOHN.,Be it yours to repair it:
7492,JOHN.,"If you did not avert, you may help her to bear t."
7493,JOHN.,
7494,ALFRED.,ALFRED.
7495,ALFRED.,
7496,ALFRED.,I might have averted.
7497,ALFRED.,
7498,JOHN.,JOHN.
7499,JOHN.,
7500,JOHN.,Perhaps so.  But now
7501,JOHN.,"There is clearly no use in considering how,"
7502,JOHN.,"Or whence, came the mischief.  The mischief is here."
7503,JOHN.,Broken shins are not mended by crying--that's clear!
7504,JOHN.,"One has but to rub them, and get up again,"
7505,JOHN.,And push on--and not think too much of the pain.
7506,JOHN.,And at least it is much that you see that to her
7507,JOHN.,You owe too much to think of yourself.  You must stir
7508,JOHN.,"And arouse yourself Alfred, for her sake.  Who knows?"
7509,JOHN.,Something yet may be saved from this wreck.  I suppose
7510,JOHN.,"We shall make him disgorge all he can, at the least."
7511,JOHN.,
7512,JOHN.,"""O Jack, I have been a brute idiot! a beast!"
7513,JOHN.,"A fool! I have sinn'd, and to HER I have sinn'd!"
7514,JOHN.,"I have been heedless, blind, inexcusably blind!"
7515,JOHN.,"And now, in a flash, I see all things!"""
7516,JOHN.,As though
7517,JOHN.,"To shut out the vision, he bow'd his head low"
7518,JOHN.,On his hands; and the great tears in silence roll'd on
7519,JOHN.,"And fell momently, heavily, one after one."
7520,JOHN.,John felt no desire to find instant relief
7521,JOHN.,For the trouble he witness'd.
7522,JOHN.,"He guess'd, in the grief"
7523,JOHN.,"Of his cousin, the broken and heartfelt admission"
7524,JOHN.,Of some error demanding a heartfelt contrition:
7525,JOHN.,Some oblivion perchance which could plead less excuse
7526,JOHN.,To the heart of a man re-aroused to the use
7527,JOHN.,"Of the conscience God gave him, than simply and merely"
7528,JOHN.,The neglect for which now he was paying so dearly.
7529,JOHN.,"So he rose without speaking, and paced up and down"
7530,JOHN.,"The long room, much afflicted, indeed, in his own"
7531,JOHN.,Cordial heart for Matilda.
7532,JOHN.,"Thus, silently lost"
7533,JOHN.,"In his anxious reflections, he cross'd and re-cross'd"
7534,JOHN.,The place where his cousin yet hopelessly hung
7535,JOHN.,O'er the table; his fingers entwisted among
7536,JOHN.,"The rich curls they were knotting and dragging: and there,"
7537,JOHN.,"That sound of all sounds the most painful to hear,"
7538,JOHN.,The sobs of a man!  Yet so far in his own
7539,JOHN.,"Kindly thoughts was he plunged, he already had grown"
7540,JOHN.,Unconscious of Alfred.
7541,JOHN.,And so for a space
7542,JOHN.,There was silence between them.
7543,JOHN.,
7544,JOHN.,
7545,VII.,VII.
7546,VII.,
7547,VII.,
7548,VII.,"At last, with sad face"
7549,VII.,"He stopp'd short, and bent on his cousin awhile"
7550,VII.,"A pain'd sort of wistful, compassionate smile,"
7551,VII.,"Approach'd him,--stood o'er him,--and suddenly laid"
7552,VII.,One hand on his shoulder--
7553,VII.,"""Where is she?"" he said."
7554,VII.,Alfred lifted his face all disfigured with tears
7555,VII.,"And gazed vacantly at him, like one that appears"
7556,VII.,"In some foreign language to hear himself greeted,"
7557,VII.,Unable to answer.
7558,VII.,"""Where is she?"" repeated"
7559,VII.,His cousin.
7560,VII.,He motioned his hand to the door;
7561,VII.,"""There, I think,"" he replied.  Cousin John said no more,"
7562,VII.,"And appear'd to relapse to his own cogitations,"
7563,VII.,Of which not a gesture vouchsafed indications.
7564,VII.,So again there was silence.
7565,VII.,A timepiece at last
7566,VII.,Struck the twelve strokes of midnight.
7567,VII.,"Roused by them, he cast"
7568,VII.,A half-look to the dial; then quietly threw
7569,VII.,"His arm round the neck of his cousin, and drew"
7570,VII.,The hands down from his face.
7571,VII.,"""It is time she should know"
7572,VII.,"What has happen'd,"" he said,... ""let us go to her now."""
7573,VII.,Alfred started at once to his feet.
7574,VII.,Drawn and wan
7575,VII.,"Though his face, he look'd more than his wont was--a man."
7576,VII.,"Strong for once, in his weakness.  Uplifted, fill'd through"
7577,VII.,With a manly resolve.
7578,VII.,If that axiom be true
7579,VII.,"Of the ""Sum quia cogito,"" I must opine"
7580,VII.,"That ""id sum quod cogito;""--that which, in fine"
7581,VII.,"A man thinks and feels, with his whole force of thought"
7582,VII.,"And feeling, the man is himself."
7583,VII.,He had fought
7584,VII.,"With himself, and rose up from his self-overthrow"
7585,VII.,The survivor of much which that strife had laid low
7586,VII.,"At his feet, as he rose at the name of his wife,"
7587,VII.,Lay in ruins the brilliant unrealized life
7588,VII.,"Which, though yet unfulfill'd, seem'd till then, in that name,"
7589,VII.,"To be his, had he claim'd it.  The man's dream of fame"
7590,VII.,And of power fell shatter'd before him; and only
7591,VII.,"There rested the heart of the woman, so lonely"
7592,VII.,In all save the love he could give her.  The lord
7593,VII.,"Of that heart he arose.  Blush not, Muse, to record"
7594,VII.,"That his first thought, and last, at that moment was not"
7595,VII.,"Of the power and fame that seem'd lost to his lot,"
7596,VII.,But the love that was left to it; not of the pelf
7597,VII.,"He had cared for, yet squander'd; and not of himself,"
7598,VII.,"But of her; as he murmur'd,"
7599,VII.,"""One moment, dear jack!"
7600,VII.,We have grown up from boyhood together.  Our track
7601,VII.,Has been through the same meadows in childhood: in youth
7602,VII.,"Through the same silent gateways, to manhood.  In truth,"
7603,VII.,There is none that can know me as you do; and none
7604,VII.,To whom I more wish to believe myself known.
7605,VII.,"Speak the truth; you are not wont to mince it, I know."
7606,VII.,"Nor I, shall I shirk it, or shrink from it now."
7607,VII.,"In despite of a wanton behavior, in spite"
7608,VII.,"Of vanity, folly, and pride, Jack, which might"
7609,VII.,Have turn'd from me many a heart strong and true
7610,VII.,"As your own, I have never turn'd round and miss'd YOU"
7611,VII.,From my side in one hour of affliction or doubt
7612,VII.,By my own blind and heedless self-will brought about.
7613,VII.,Tell me truth.  Do I owe this alone to the sake
7614,VII.,Of those old recollections of boyhood that make
7615,VII.,In your heart yet some clinging and crying appeal
7616,VII.,"From a judgment more harsh, which I cannot but feel"
7617,VII.,Might have sentenced our friendship to death long ago?
7618,VII.,Or is it... (I would I could deem it were so!)
7619,VII.,"That, not all overlaid by a listless exterior,"
7620,VII.,Your heart has divined in me something superior
7621,VII.,To that which I seem; from my innermost nature
7622,VII.,Not wholly expell'd by the world's usurpature?
7623,VII.,"Some instinct of earnestness, truth, or desire"
7624,VII.,For truth?  Some one spark of the soul's native fire
7625,VII.,"Moving under the ashes, and cinders, and dust"
7626,VII.,Which life hath heap'd o'er it?  Some one fact to trust
7627,VII.,And to hope in?  Or by you alone am I deem'd
7628,VII.,The mere frivolous fool I so often have seem'd
7629,VII.,"To my own self?"""
7630,VII.,
7631,JOHN.,JOHN.
7632,JOHN.,
7633,JOHN.,"No, Alfred! you will, I believe,"
7634,JOHN.,"Be true, at the last, to what now makes you grieve"
7635,JOHN.,For having belied your true nature so long.
7636,JOHN.,Necessity is a stern teacher.  Be strong!
7637,JOHN.,
7638,JOHN.,"""Do you think,"" he resumed,... ""what I feel while I speak"
7639,JOHN.,"Is no more than a transient emotion, as weak"
7640,JOHN.,"As these weak tears would seem to betoken it?"""
7641,JOHN.,

7644,JOHN.,No!

7663,ALFRED.,"(Poor infant!) too surely, this mission of sorrow;"
7664,ALFRED.,"If she sleeps, I will not mar her dreams of tomorrow."
7665,ALFRED.,"He open'd the door, and pass'd out."
7666,ALFRED.,Cousin John
7667,ALFRED.,"Watch'd him wistful, and left him to seek her alone."

7673,IX.,"His heart beat so loud when he knock'd at her door,"
7674,IX.,He could hear no reply from within.  Yet once more
7675,IX.,He knock'd lightly.  No answer.  The handle he tried:
7676,IX.,The door open'd: he enter'd the room undescried.

7679,X.,X.
7680,X.,
7681,X.,
7682,X.,No brighter than is that dim circlet of light
7683,X.,"Which enhaloes the moon when rains form on the night,"
7684,X.,The pale lamp an indistinct radiance shed
7685,X.,"Round the chamber, in which at her pure snowy bed"
7686,X.,Matilda was kneeling; so wrapt in deep prayer
7687,X.,That she knew not her husband stood watching her there.
7688,X.,With the lamplight the moonlight had mingled a faint
7689,X.,And unearthly effulgence which seem'd to acquaint
7690,X.,The whole place with a sense of deep peace made secure
7691,X.,By the presence of something angelic and pure.
7692,X.,And not purer some angel Grief carves o'er the tomb
7693,X.,"Where Love lies, than the lady that kneel'd in that gloom."
7694,X.,She had put off her dress; and she look'd to his eyes
7695,X.,Like a young soul escaped from its earthly disguise;
7696,X.,"Her fair neck and innocent shoulders were bare,"
7697,X.,And over them rippled her soft golden hair;
7698,X.,Her simple and slender white bodice unlaced
7699,X.,Confined not one curve of her delicate waist.
7700,X.,"As the light that, from water reflected, forever,"
7701,X.,"Trembles up through the tremulous reeds of a river,"
7702,X.,"So the beam of her beauty went trembling in him,"
7703,X.,Through the thoughts it suffused with a sense soft and dim.
7704,X.,Reproducing itself in the broken and bright
7705,X.,Lapse and pulse of a million emotions.
7706,X.,That sight
7707,X.,"Bow'd his heart, bow'd his knee.  Knowing scarce what he did,"
7708,X.,"To her side through the chamber he silently slid,"
7709,X.,And knelt down beside her--and pray'd at her side.
7710,X.,
7711,X.,
7712,XI.,XI.
7713,XI.,
7714,XI.,
7715,XI.,"Upstarting, she then for the first time descried"
7716,XI.,That her husband was near her; suffused with the blush
7717,XI.,Which came o'er her soft pallid cheek with a gush
7718,XI.,Where the tears sparkled yet.
7719,XI.,"As a young fawn uncouches,"
7720,XI.,"Shy with fear from the fern where some hunter approaches,"
7721,XI.,"She shrank back; he caught her, and circling his arm"
7722,XI.,"Round her waist, on her brow press'd one kiss long and warm."
7723,XI.,Then her fear changed in impulse; and hiding her face
7724,XI.,"On his breast, she hung lock'd in a clinging embrace"
7725,XI.,"With her soft arms wound heavily round him, as though"
7726,XI.,"She fear'd, if their clasp was relaxed, he would go:"
7727,XI.,"Her smooth, naked shoulders, uncared for, convulsed"
7728,XI.,"By sob after sob, while her bosom yet pulsed"
7729,XI.,"In its pressure on his, as the effort within it"
7730,XI.,Lived and died with each tender tumultuous minute.
7731,XI.,"""O Alfred, O Alfred! forgive me,"" she cried--"
7732,XI.,"""Forgive me!"""
7733,XI.,"""Forgive you, my poor child!"" he sigh'd;"
7734,XI.,"""But I never have blamed you for aught that I know,"
7735,XI.,"And I have not one thought that reproaches you now."""
7736,XI.,From her arms he unwound himself gently.  And so
7737,XI.,He forced her down softly beside him.  Below
7738,XI.,"The canopy shading their couch, they sat down."
7739,XI.,"And he said, clasping firmly her hand in his own,"
7740,XI.,"""When a proud man, Matilda, has found out at length,"
7741,XI.,"That he is but a child in the midst of his strength,"
7742,XI.,"But a fool in his wisdom, to whom can he own"

7744,XI.,"From whom seek the strength which his need of is sore,"
7745,XI.,"Although in his pride he might perish, before"

7747,XI.,"'Mid his intimate friends?  Wife of mine, tell me now,"
7748,XI.,"Do you join me in feeling, in that darken'd hour,"
7749,XI.,The sole friend that CAN have the right or the power
7750,XI.,"To be at his side, is the woman that shares"
7751,XI.,"His fate, if he falter; the woman that bears"
7752,XI.,"The name dear for HER sake, and hallows the life"
7753,XI.,"She has mingled her own with,--in short, that man's wife?"""
7754,XI.,"""Yes,"" murmur'd Matilda, ""O yes!"""
7755,XI.,"""Then,"" he cried,"
7756,XI.,"""This chamber in which we two sit, side by side,"
7757,XI.,"(And his arm, as he spoke, seem'd more softly to press her),"
7758,XI.,"Is now a confessional--you, my confessor!"""
7759,XI.,"""I?"" she falter'd, and timidly lifted her head."
7760,XI.,"""Yes! but first answer one other question,"" he said:"
7761,XI.,"""When a woman once feels that she is not alone:"
7762,XI.,That the heart of another is warm'd by her own;
7763,XI.,That another feels with her whatever she feel
7764,XI.,And halves her existence in woe or in weal;
7765,XI.,"That a man, for her sake, will, so long as he lives,"
7766,XI.,Live to put forth the strength which the thought of her gives;
7767,XI.,"Live to shield her from want, and to share with her sorrow;"
7768,XI.,"Live to solace the day, and provide for the morrow:"
7769,XI.,"Will that woman feel less than another, O say,"
7770,XI.,"The loss of what life, sparing this, takes away?"
7771,XI.,"Will she feel (feeling this), when calamities come,"
7772,XI.,"That they brighten the heart, though they darken the home?"""
7773,XI.,"She turn'd, like a soft rainy heav'n, on him"
7774,XI.,"Eyes that smiled through fresh tears, trustful, tender, and dim."
7775,XI.,"""That woman,"" she murmur'd, ""indeed were thrice blest!"""
7776,XI.,"""Then courage, true wife of my heart!"" to his breast"
7777,XI.,"As he folded and gather'd her closely, he cried."
7778,XI.,"""For the refuge, to-night in these arms open'd wide"
7779,XI.,"To your heart, can be never closed to it again,"
7780,XI.,And this room is for both an asylum!  For when
7781,XI.,"I pass'd through that door, at the door I left there"
7782,XI.,A calamity sudden and heavy to bear.
7783,XI.,"One step from that threshold, and daily, I fear,"
7784,XI.,"We must face it henceforth; but it enters not here,"
7785,XI.,"For that door shuts it out, and admits here alone"
7786,XI.,"A heart which calamity leaves all your own!"""
7787,XI.,"She started... ""Calamity, Alfred, to you?"""
7788,XI.,"""To both, my poor child, but 'twill bring with it too"
7789,XI.,"The courage, I trust, to subdue it."""
7790,XI.,"""O speak!"
7791,XI.,"Speak!"" she falter'd in tones timid, anxious, and weak."
7792,XI.,"""O yet for a moment,"" he said, ""hear me on!"
7793,XI.,"Matilda, this morn we went forth in the sun,"
7794,XI.,"Like those children of sunshine, the bright summer flies,"
7795,XI.,"That sport in the sunbeam, and play through the skies"
7796,XI.,"While the skies smile, and heed not each other: at last,"
7797,XI.,"When their sunbeam is gone, and their sky overcast,"
7798,XI.,Who recks in what ruin they fold their wet wings?
7799,XI.,"So indeed the morn found us,--poor frivolous things!"
7800,XI.,"Now our sky is o'ercast, and our sunbeam is set,"
7801,XI.,And the night brings its darkness around us.  Oh yet
7802,XI.,Have we weather'd no storm through those twelve cloudless hours?
7803,XI.,"Yes; you, too, have wept!"
7804,XI.,"""While the world was yet ours,"
7805,XI.,"While its sun was upon us, its incense stream'd to us,"
7806,XI.,"And its myriad voices of joy seem'd to woo us,"
7807,XI.,"We stray'd from each other, too far, it may be,"
7808,XI.,"Nor, wantonly wandering, then did I see"
7809,XI.,"How deep was my need of thee, dearest, how great"
7810,XI.,Was thy claim on my heart and thy share in my fate!
7811,XI.,"But, Matilda, an angel was near us, meanwhile,"
7812,XI.,"Watching o'er us to warn, and to rescue!"
7813,XI.,"""That smile"
7814,XI.,"Which you saw with suspicion, that presence you eyed"
7815,XI.,"With resentment, an angel's they were at your side"
7816,XI.,"And at mine; nor perchance is the day all so far,"
7817,XI.,"When we both in our prayers, when most heartfelt they are,"
7818,XI.,May murmur the name of that woman now gone
7819,XI.,From our sight evermore.
7820,XI.,"""Here, this evening, alone,"
7821,XI.,"I seek your forgiveness, in opening my heart"
7822,XI.,"Unto yours,--from this clasp be it never to part!"
7823,XI.,"Matilda, the fortune you brought me is gone,"
7824,XI.,But a prize richer far than that fortune has won
7825,XI.,"It is yours to confer, and I kneel for that prize,"
7826,XI.,"'Tis the heart of my wife!""  With suffused happy eyes"
7827,XI.,"She sprang from her seat, flung her arms wide apart,"
7828,XI.,"And tenderly closing them round him, his heart"
7829,XI.,Clasp'd in one close embrace to her bosom; and there
7830,XI.,Droop'd her head on his shoulder; and sobb'd.
7831,XI.,"Not despair,"
7832,XI.,"Not sorrow, not even the sense of her loss,"
7833,XI.,"Flow'd in those happy tears, so oblivious she was"
7834,XI.,"Of all save the sense of her own love!  Anon,"
7835,XI.,"However, his words rush'd back to her.  ""All gone,"
7836,XI.,"The fortune you brought me!"""
7837,XI.,And eyes that were dim
7838,XI.,With soft tears she upraised; but those tears were for HIM.
7839,XI.,"""Gone! my husband?"" she said,"" tell me all! see! I need,"
7840,XI.,"To sober this rapture, so selfish indeed,"
7841,XI.,"Fuller sense of affliction."""
7842,XI.,"""Poor innocent child!"""
7843,XI.,"He kiss'd her fair forehead, and mournfully smiled,"
7844,XI.,"As he told her the tale he had heard--something more,"
7845,XI.,The gain found in loss of what gain lost of yore.
7846,XI.,"""Rest, my heart, and my brain, and my right hand, for you;"
7847,XI.,"And with these, my Matilda, what may I not do?"
7848,XI.,"And know not, I knew not myself till this hour,"
7849,XI.,"Which so sternly reveal'd it, my nature's full power."""
7850,XI.,"""And I too,"" she murmur'd, ""I too am no more"

7852,XI.,I have suffer'd since then.  I have learn'd much in life.
7853,XI.,"O take, with the faith I have pledged as a wife,"
7854,XI.,The heart I have learn'd as a woman to feel!
7855,XI.,"For I--love you, my husband!"""
7856,XI.,As though to conceal
7857,XI.,"Less from him, than herself, what that motion express'd,"
7858,XI.,"She dropp'd her bright head, and hid all on his breast."
7859,XI.,"""O lovely as woman, beloved as wife!"

8767,VIII.,"No light cloud like those which, for June to dispel,"

8816,X.,"The sufferer sees that still form floating on,"
8817,X.,And feels faintly aware that he is not alone.
8818,X.,She is flitting before him.  She pauses.  She stands
8819,X.,By his bedside all silent.  She lays her white hands
8820,X.,On the brow of the boy.  A light finger is pressing
8821,X.,"Softly, softly the sore wounds: the hot blood-stain'd dressing"
8822,X.,Slips from them.  A comforting quietude steals
8823,X.,"Through the rack'd weary frame; and, throughout it, he feels"
8824,X.,"The slow sense of a merciful, mild neighborhood."
8825,X.,Something smooths the toss'd pillow.  Beneath a gray hood
8826,X.,"Of rough serge, two intense tender eyes are bent o'er him,"
8827,X.,"And thrill through and through him.  The sweet form before him,"

8838,XI.,Meanwhile has been silently changing and cheering
8839,XI.,The aspect of all things around him.
8840,XI.,Revering
8841,XI.,"Some power unknown, and benignant, he bless'd"
8842,XI.,In silence the sense of salvation.  And rest

8880,XII.,She bent down to smooth
8881,XII.,"The hot pillow; and added... ""Yet more than another"

8884,XII.,"""Oh, can it be? you!"

8889,XII.,"He brokenly, timidly said,"
8890,XII.,"""Do they know I am thus?"""
8891,XII.,"""Hush!""... she smiled, as she drew"
8892,XII.,From her bosom two letters: and--can it be true?
8893,XII.,That beloved and familiar writing!
8894,XII.,He burst
8895,XII.,"Into tears... ""My poor mother--my father! the worst"
8896,XII.,"Will have reach'd them!"""
8897,XII.,"""No, no!"" she exclaimed, with a smile,"
8898,XII.,"""They know you are living; they know that meanwhile"
8899,XII.,"I am watching beside you.  Young soldier, weep not!"""
8900,XII.,"But still on the nun's nursing bosom, the hot"
8901,XII.,Fever'd brow of the boy weeping wildly is press'd.
8902,XII.,"There, at last, the young heart sobs itself into rest:"

8913,XIII.,Through that young hardy frame novel currents of health.
8914,XIII.,"Yet some strange obstruction, which life's health by stealth"
8915,XIII.,"Seemed to cherish, impeded life's progress.  And still"
8916,XIII.,"A feebleness, less of the frame than the will,"
8917,XIII.,Clung about the sick man--hid and harbor'd within
8918,XIII.,The sad hollow eyes: pinch'd the cheek pale and thin:
8919,XIII.,And clothed the wan fingers with languor.
8920,XIII.,"And there,"
8921,XIII.,"Day by day, night by night, unremitting in care,"
8922,XIII.,"Unwearied in watching, so cheerful of mien,"

8927,XIV.,
8928,XIV.,
8929,XIV.,"A strange woman truly! not young; yet her face,"

8931,XIV.,Of a beauty which time could not ruin.  For the whole
8932,XIV.,"Quiet cheek, youth's lost bloom left transparent, the soul"
8933,XIV.,"Seemed to fill with its own light, like some sunny fountain"
8934,XIV.,Everlastingly fed from far off in the mountain
8935,XIV.,"That pours, in a garden deserted, its streams,"
8936,XIV.,And all the more lovely for loneliness seems.
8937,XIV.,"So that, watching that face, you could scarce pause to guess"
8938,XIV.,"The years which its calm careworn lines might express,"

8968,XV.,"When we leave the bruised hearts, if we bind the bruised bone?"
8969,XV.,"Nay, is not the mission of mercy twofold?"
8970,XV.,"Whence twofold, perchance, are the powers that we hold"
8971,XV.,"To fulfil it, of Heaven!  For Heaven doth still"

8977,XV.,"""I am not so dead in remembrance to all"
8978,XV.,"I have died to in this world, but what I recall"
8979,XV.,"Enough of its sorrow, enough of its trial,"
8980,XV.,To grieve for both--save from both haply!  The dial
8981,XV.,"Receives many shades, and each points to the sun."
8982,XV.,"The shadows are many, the sunlight is one."
8983,XV.,Life's sorrows still fluctuate: God's love does not.
8984,XV.,"And His love is unchanged, when it changes our lot."
8985,XV.,"Looking up to this light, which is common to all,"
8986,XV.,"And down to these shadows, on each side, that fall"
8987,XV.,"In time's silent circle, so various for each,"
8988,XV.,Is it nothing to know that they never can reach
8989,XV.,"So far, but what light lies beyond them forever?"
8990,XV.,"Trust to me!  Oh, if in this hour I endeavor"

8996,XV.,She paused: he was weeping.  Small need
8997,XV.,"Of added appeal, or entreaty, indeed,"
8998,XV.,Had those gentle accents to win from his pale
8999,XV.,"And parch'd, trembling lips, as it rose, the brief tale"
9000,XV.,"Of a life's early sorrow.  The story is old,"
9001,XV.,And in words few as may be shall straightway be told.

9006,XVI.,
9007,XVI.,"A few years ago, ere the fair form of Peace"

9009,XVI.,"Of a French noble, leaving an old Norman pile"
9010,XVI.,"By the wild northern seas, came to dwell for a while"
9011,XVI.,With a lady allied to her race--an old dame
9012,XVI.,"Of a threefold legitimate virtue, and name,"
9013,XVI.,In the Faubourg Saint Germain.
9014,XVI.,"Upon that fair child,"
9015,XVI.,"From childhood, nor father nor mother had smiled."
9016,XVI.,"One uncle their place in her life had supplied,"
9017,XVI.,"And their place in her heart: she had grown at his side,"
9018,XVI.,"And under his roof-tree, and in his regard,"
9019,XVI.,From childhood to girlhood.
9020,XVI.,This fair orphan ward
9021,XVI.,Seem'd the sole human creature that lived in the heart
9022,XVI.,"Of that stern rigid man, or whose smile could impart"
9023,XVI.,"One ray of response to the eyes which, above"
9024,XVI.,"Her fair infant forehead, look'd down with a love"
9025,XVI.,"That seem'd almost stern, so intense was its chill"
9026,XVI.,"Lofty stillness, like sunlight on some lonely hill"
9027,XVI.,Which is colder and stiller than sunlight elsewhere.
9028,XVI.,
9029,XVI.,Grass grew in the court-yard; the chambers were bare
9030,XVI.,In that ancient mansion; when first the stern tread
9031,XVI.,Of its owner awaken'd their echoes long dead:
9032,XVI.,"Bringing with him this infant (the child of a brother),"
9033,XVI.,"Whom, dying, the hands of a desolate mother"
9034,XVI.,Had placed on his bosom.  'Twas said--right or wrong--
9035,XVI.,"That, in the lone mansion, left tenantless long,"
9036,XVI.,"To which, as a stranger, its lord now return'd,"
9037,XVI.,"In years yet recall'd, through loud midnights had burn'd"
9038,XVI.,"The light of wild orgies.  Be that false or true,"
9039,XVI.,Slow and sad was the footstep which now wander'd through
9040,XVI.,Those desolate chambers; and calm and severe
9041,XVI.,Was the life of their inmate.
9042,XVI.,Men now saw appear
9043,XVI.,"Every morn at the mass that firm sorrowful face,"
9044,XVI.,Which seem'd to lock up in a cold iron case
9045,XVI.,"Tears harden'd to crystal.  Yet harsh if he were,"
9046,XVI.,His severity seem'd to be trebly severe
9047,XVI.,"In the rule of his own rigid life, which, at least,"
9048,XVI.,"Was benignant to others.  The poor parish priest,"
9049,XVI.,"Who lived on his largess, his piety praised."
9050,XVI.,"The peasant was fed, and the chapel was raised,"
9051,XVI.,"And the cottage was built, by his liberal hand."
9052,XVI.,Yet he seem'd in the midst of his good deeds to stand
9053,XVI.,"A lone, and unloved, and unlovable man."
9054,XVI.,There appear'd some inscrutable flaw in the plan
9055,XVI.,"Of his life, that love fail'd to pass over."
9056,XVI.,That child
9057,XVI.,"Alone did not fear him, nor shrink from him; smiled"
9058,XVI.,"To his frown, and dispell'd it."
9059,XVI.,The sweet sportive elf
9060,XVI.,"Seem'd the type of some joy lost, and miss'd, in himself."
9061,XVI.,Ever welcome he suffer'd her glad face to glide
9062,XVI.,In on hours when to others his door was denied:
9063,XVI.,And many a time with a mute moody look
9064,XVI.,"He would watch her at prattle and play, like a brook"
9065,XVI.,"Whose babble disturbs not the quietest spot,"
9066,XVI.,But soothes us because we need answer it not.
9067,XVI.,
9068,XVI.,But few years had pass'd o'er that childhood before
9069,XVI.,"A change came among them.  A letter, which bore"
9070,XVI.,"Sudden consequence with it, one morning was placed"
9071,XVI.,In the hands of the lord of the chateau.  He paced
9072,XVI.,To and fro in his chamber a whole night alone
9073,XVI.,After reading that letter.  At dawn he was gone.
9074,XVI.,Weeks pass'd.  When he came back again he return'd
9075,XVI.,"With a tall ancient dame, from whose lips the child learn'd"
9076,XVI.,That they were of the same race and name.  With a face
9077,XVI.,"Sad and anxious, to this wither'd stock of the race"
9078,XVI.,"He confided the orphan, and left them alone"
9079,XVI.,In the old lonely house.
9080,XVI.,"In a few days 'twas known,"
9081,XVI.,"To the angry surprise of half Paris, that one"
9082,XVI.,"Of the chiefs of that party which, still clinging on"
9083,XVI.,"To the banner that bears the white lilies of France,"
9084,XVI.,"Will fight 'neath no other, nor yet for the chance"
9085,XVI.,"Of restoring their own, had renounced the watchword"
9086,XVI.,"And the creed of his youth in unsheathing his sword,"
9087,XVI.,For a Fatherland father'd no more (such is fate!)
9088,XVI.,By legitimate parents.
9089,XVI.,"And meanwhile, elate"
9090,XVI.,"And in no wise disturbed by what Paris might say,"
9091,XVI.,The new soldier thus wrote to a friend far away:--
9092,XVI.,"""To the life of inaction farewell!  After all,"
9093,XVI.,"Creeds the oldest may crumble, and dynasties fall,"
9094,XVI.,"But the sole grand Legitimacy will endure,"
9095,XVI.,"In whatever makes death noble, life strong and pure."
9096,XVI.,Freedom! action!... the desert to breathe in--the lance
9097,XVI.,"Of the Arab to follow!  I go! vive la France!"""
9098,XVI.,
9099,XVI.,"Few and rare were the meetings henceforth, as years fled,"
9100,XVI.,'Twixt the child and the soldier.  The two women led
9101,XVI.,Lone lives in the lone house.  Meanwhile the child grew
9102,XVI.,"Into girlhood; and, like a sunbeam, sliding through"
9103,XVI.,"Her green quiet years, changed by gentle degrees"
9104,XVI.,To the loveliest vision of youth a youth sees
9105,XVI.,"In his loveliest fancies: as pure as a pearl,"
9106,XVI.,"And as perfect: a noble and innocent girl,"
9107,XVI.,With eighteen sweet summers dissolved in the light
9108,XVI.,"Of her lovely and lovable eyes, soft and bright!"
9109,XVI.,"Then her guardian wrote to the dame,... ""Let Constance"
9110,XVI.,Go with you to Paris.  I trust that in France
9111,XVI.,I may be ere the close of the year.  I confide
9112,XVI.,"My life's treasure to you.  Let her see, at your side,"
9113,XVI.,"The world which we live in."""
9114,XVI.,To Paris then came
9115,XVI.,Constance to abide with that old stately dame
9116,XVI.,In that old stately Faubourg.
9117,XVI.,The young Englishman
9118,XVI.,"Thus met her.  'Twas there their acquaintance began,"
9119,XVI.,"There it closed.  That old miracle, Love-at-first-sight,"
9120,XVI.,Needs no explanations.  The heart reads aright
9121,XVI.,Its destiny sometimes.  His love neither chidden
9122,XVI.,"Nor check'd, the young soldier was graciously bidden"
9123,XVI.,An habitual guest to that house by the dame.
9124,XVI.,"His own candid graces, the world-honor'd name"
9125,XVI.,Of his father (in him not dishonor'd) were both
9126,XVI.,"Fair titles to favor.  His love, nothing loath,"
9127,XVI.,"The old lady observed, was return'd by Constance."
9128,XVI.,And as the child's uncle his absence from France
9129,XVI.,"Yet prolong'd, she (thus easing long self-gratulation)"
9130,XVI.,Wrote to him a lengthen'd and moving narration
9131,XVI.,Of the graces and gifts of the young English wooer:
9132,XVI.,His father's fair fame; the boy's deference to her;
9133,XVI.,"His love for Constance,--unaffected, sincere;"
9134,XVI.,"And the girl's love for him, read by her in those clear"
9135,XVI.,Limpid eyes; then the pleasure with which she awaited
9136,XVI.,Her cousin's approval of all she had stated.
9137,XVI.,
9138,XVI.,"At length from that cousin an answer there came,"
9139,XVI.,"Brief, stern; such as stunn'd and astonish'd the dame."
9140,XVI.,
9141,XVI.,"""Let Constance leave Paris with you on the day"
9142,XVI.,You receive this.  Until my return she may stay
9143,XVI.,At her convent awhile.  If my niece wishes ever
9144,XVI.,"To behold me again, understand, she will never"
9145,XVI.,Wed that man.
9146,XVI.,"""You have broken faith with me.  Farewell!"""
9147,XVI.,No appeal from that sentence.
9148,XVI.,It needs not to tell
9149,XVI.,"The tears of Constance, nor the grief of her lover:"
9150,XVI.,The dream they had laid out their lives in was over.
9151,XVI.,Bravely strove the young soldier to look in the face
9152,XVI.,Of a life where invisible hands seemed to trace
9153,XVI.,"O'er the threshold these words... ""Hope no more!"""
9154,XVI.,
9155,XVI.,Unreturn'd
9156,XVI.,"Had his love been, the strong manful heart would have spurn'd"
9157,XVI.,That weakness which suffers a woman to lie
9158,XVI.,"At the roots of man's life, like a canker, and dry"
9159,XVI.,And wither the sap of life's purpose.  But there
9160,XVI.,Lay the bitterer part of the pain!  Could he dare
9161,XVI.,To forget he was loved? that he grieved not alone?
9162,XVI.,Recording a love that drew sorrow upon
9163,XVI.,"The woman he loved, for himself dare he seek"
9164,XVI.,"Surcease to that sorrow, which thus held him weak,"
9165,XVI.,"Beat him down, and destroy'd him?"
9166,XVI.,"News reach'd him indeed,"
9167,XVI.,"Through a comrade, who brought him a letter to read"
9168,XVI.,From the dame who had care of Constance (it was one
9169,XVI.,"To whom, when at Paris, the boy had been known,"
9170,XVI.,"A Frenchman, and friend of the Faubourg), which said"
9171,XVI.,"That Constance, although never a murmur betray'd"
9172,XVI.,"What she suffer'd, in silence grew paler each day,"
9173,XVI.,And seem'd visibly drooping and dying away.
9174,XVI.,It was then he sought death.
9175,XVI.,
9176,XVI.,
9177,XVII.,XVII.
9178,XVII.,
9179,XVII.,
9180,XVII.,Thus the tale ends.  'Twas told
9181,XVII.,"With such broken, passionate words, as unfold"
9182,XVII.,"In glimpses alone, a coil'd grief.  Through each pause"
9183,XVII.,"Of its fitful recital, in raw gusty flaws,"
9184,XVII.,"The rain shook the canvas, unheeded; aloof,"
9185,XVII.,"And unheeded, the night-wind around the tent-roof"
9186,XVII.,"At intervals wirbled.  And when all was said,"
9187,XVII.,"The sick man, exhausted, droop'd backward his head,"
9188,XVII.,And fell into a feverish slumber.
9189,XVII.,Long while
9190,XVII.,"Sat the Soeur Seraphine, in deep thought.  The still smile"
9191,XVII.,"That was wont, angel-wise, to inhabit her face"
9192,XVII.,"And made it like heaven, was fled from its place"
9193,XVII.,"In her eyes, on her lips; and a deep sadness there"
9194,XVII.,"Seem'd to darken the lines of long sorrow and care,"
9195,XVII.,As low to herself she sigh'd...
9196,XVII.,"""Hath it, Eugene,"
9197,XVII.,"Been so long, then, the struggle?... and yet, all in vain!"
9198,XVII.,"Nay, not all in vain! shall the world gain a man,"
9199,XVII.,And yet Heaven lose a soul?  Have I done all I can?
9200,XVII.,"Soul to soul, did he say?  Soul to soul, be it so!"
9201,XVII.,"And then--soul of mine, whither? whither?"""

9204,XVIII.,XVIII.
9205,XVIII.,
9206,XVIII.,
9207,XVIII.,"Large, slow,"
9208,XVIII.,"Silent tears in those deep eyes ascended, and fell."
9209,XVIII.,"""HERE, at least, I have fail'd not""... she mused... ""this is well!"""
9210,XVIII.,She drew from her bosom two letters.
9211,XVIII.,"In one,"
9212,XVIII.,"A mother's heart, wild with alarm for her son,"
9213,XVIII.,Breathed bitterly forth its despairing appeal.
9214,XVIII.,"""The pledge of a love owed to thee, O Lucile!"
9215,XVIII.,The hope of a home saved by thee--of a heart
9216,XVIII.,Which hath never since then (thrice endear'd as thou art!)
9217,XVIII.,"Ceased to bless thee, to pray for thee, save! save my son!"
9218,XVIII.,"And if not""... the letter went brokenly on,"
9219,XVIII.,"""Heaven help us!"""
9220,XVIII.,"Then follow'd, from Alfred, a few"
9221,XVIII.,"Blotted heart-broken pages.  He mournfully drew,"
9222,XVIII.,"With pathos, the picture of that earnest youth,"
9223,XVIII.,So unlike his own; how in beauty and truth
9224,XVIII.,"He had nurtured that nature, so simple and brave!"
9225,XVIII.,And how he had striven his son's youth to save
9226,XVIII.,"From the errors so sadly redeem'd in his own,"
9227,XVIII.,"And so deeply repented: how thus, in that son,"
9228,XVIII.,"In whose youth he had garner'd his age, he had seem'd"
9229,XVIII.,"To be bless'd by a pledge that the past was redeem'd,"
9230,XVIII.,And forgiven.  He bitterly went on to speak
9231,XVIII.,Of the boy's baffled love; in which fate seem'd to break
9232,XVIII.,"Unawares on his dreams with retributive pain,"
9233,XVIII.,And the ghosts of the past rose to scourge back again
9234,XVIII.,The hopes of the future.  To sue for consent
9235,XVIII.,Pride forbade: and the hope his old foe might relent
9236,XVIII.,"Experience rejected... ""My life for the boy's!"""
9237,XVIII.,"(He exclaim'd); ""for I die with my son, if he dies!"
9238,XVIII.,Lucile! Heaven bless you for all you have done!
9239,XVIII.,"Save him, save him, Lucile! save my son! save my son!"""

9242,XIX.,XIX.
9243,XIX.,
9244,XIX.,
9245,XIX.,"""Ay!"" murmur'd the Soeur Seraphine... ""heart to heart!"
9246,XIX.,"THERE, at least, I have fail'd not!  Fulfill'd is my part?"
9247,XIX.,Accomplish'd my mission?  One act crowns the whole.
9248,XIX.,"Do I linger?  Nay, be it so, then!... Soul to soul!"""
9249,XIX.,"She knelt down, and pray'd.  Still the boy slumber'd on,"
9250,XIX.,Dawn broke.  The pale nun from the bedside was gone.

9255,XX.,"Meanwhile, 'mid his aides-de-camp, busily bent"

9261,XX.,"The idol, the darling, the dream and the star"
9262,XX.,"Of the younger French chivalry: daring in war,"
9263,XX.,"And wary in council.  He enter'd, indeed,"
9264,XX.,Late in life (and discarding his Bourbonite creed)
9265,XX.,"The Army of France: and had risen, in part"
9266,XX.,From a singular aptitude proved for the art
9267,XX.,"Of that wild desert warfare of ambush, surprise,"
9268,XX.,"And stratagem, which to the French camp supplies"
9269,XX.,Its subtlest intelligence; partly from chance;
9270,XX.,"Partly, too, from a name and position which France"
9271,XX.,"Was proud to put forward; but mainly, in fact,"

9286,XXI.,"In and out of the tent, all day long, to and fro,"
9287,XXI.,"The messengers come and the messengers go,"
9288,XXI.,"Upon missions of mercy, or errands of toil:"

9362,XXII.,The nun

9372,XXII.,"""The cause? ay, the cause!"""
9373,XXII.,"She vaguely repeated.  Then, after a pause,--"
9374,XXII.,"As one who, awaked unawares, would put back"
9375,XXII.,The sleep that forever returns in the track
9376,XXII.,"Of dreams which, though scared and dispersed, not the less"
9377,XXII.,"Settle back to faint eyelids that yield 'neath their stress,"
9378,XXII.,"Like doves to a pent-house,--a movement she made,"
9379,XXII.,Less toward him than away from herself; droop'd her head
9380,XXII.,"And folded her hands on her bosom: long, spare,"
9381,XXII.,"Fatigued, mournful hands!  Not a stream of stray hair"
9382,XXII.,Escaped the pale bands; scarce more pale than the face
9383,XXII.,Which they bound and lock'd up in a rigid white case.
9384,XXII.,She fix'd her eyes on him.  There crept a vague awe

9393,XXII.,That he trod on (as one who walks fearing the sound
9394,XXII.,Of his footstep may startle and scare out of sight

9397,XXII.,"On her shoulder in silence; bent o'er her his head,"
9398,XXII.,Search'd her face with a long look of troubled appeal

9412,XXII.,"Deep, tender, serene,"
9413,XXII.,And sad was the gaze which the Soeur Seraphine

9450,XXIV.,The strength

9462,XXIV.,"While the leaf's in the bud, while the stem's in the green,"
9463,XXIV.,"A light bird bends the branch, a light breeze breaks the bough,"
9464,XXIV.,"Which, if spared by the light breeze, the light bird, may grow"

9487,XXV.,An ineffable tenderness troubled her voice;
9488,XXV.,"It grew weak, and a sigh broke it through."
9489,XXV.,Then he said
9490,XXV.,"(Never looking at her, never lifting his head,"
9491,XXV.,"As though, at his feet, there lay visibly hurl'd"
9492,XXV.,"Those fragments), ""It was not a love, 'twas a world,"
9493,XXV.,"'Twas a life that lay ruin'd, Lucile!"""

9495,XXV.,
9496,XXVI.,XXVI.
9497,XXVI.,
9498,XXVI.,
9499,XXVI.,She went on.
9500,XXVI.,"""So be it!  Perish Babel, arise Babylon!"
9501,XXVI.,"From ruins like these rise the fanes that shall last,"
9502,XXVI.,"And to build up the future heaven shatters the past."""
9503,XXVI.,"""Ay,"" he moodily murmur'd, ""and who cares to scan"
9504,XXVI.,"The heart's perish'd world, if the world gains a man?"
9505,XXVI.,"From the past to the present, though late, I appeal;"
9506,XXVI.,"To the nun Seraphine, from the woman Lucile!"""
9507,XXVI.,
9508,XXVI.,
9509,XXVII.,XXVII.
9510,XXVII.,
9511,XXVII.,
9512,XXVII.,Lucile!... the old name--the old self! silenced long:
9513,XXVII.,Heard once more! felt once more!
9514,XXVII.,As some soul to the throng
9515,XXVII.,"Of invisible spirits admitted, baptized"
9516,XXVII.,By death to a new name and nature--surprised
9517,XXVII.,"'Mid the songs of the seraphs, hears faintly, and far,"
9518,XXVII.,"Some voice from the earth, left below a dim star,"
9519,XXVII.,Calling to her forlornly; and (sadd'ning the psalms
9520,XXVII.,"Of the angels, and piercing the Paradise palms!)"
9521,XXVII.,The name borne 'mid earthly beloveds on earth
9522,XXVII.,Sigh'd above some lone grave in the land of her birth;--
9523,XXVII.,"So that one word... Lucile!... stirr'd the Soeur Seraphine,"
9524,XXVII.,For a moment.  Anon she resumed here serene
9525,XXVII.,And concentrated calm.
9526,XXVII.,"""Let the Nun, then, retrace"
9527,XXVII.,"The life of the soldier!""... she said, with a face"
9528,XXVII.,"That glow'd, gladdening her words."
9529,XXVII.,"""To the present I come:"
9530,XXVII.,"Leave the Past!"""
9531,XXVII.,"There her voice rose, and seem'd as when some"
9532,XXVII.,Pale Priestess proclaims from her temple the praise
9533,XXVII.,Of her hero whose brows she is crowning with bays.
9534,XXVII.,Step by step did she follow his path from the place
9535,XXVII.,Where their two paths diverged.  Year by year did she trace
9536,XXVII.,"(Familiar with all) his, the soldier's existence."
9537,XXVII.,"Her words were of trial, endurance, resistance;"
9538,XXVII.,Of the leaguer around this besieged world of ours:
9539,XXVII.,And the same sentinels that ascend the same towers
9540,XXVII.,"And report the same foes, the same fears, the same strife,"
9541,XXVII.,Waged alike to the limits of each human life.
9542,XXVII.,"She went on to speak of the lone moody lord,"
9543,XXVII.,Shut up in his lone moody halls: every word
9544,XXVII.,Held the weight of a tear: she recorded the good
9545,XXVII.,He had patiently wrought through a whole neighborhood;
9546,XXVII.,"And the blessing that lived on the lips of the poor,"
9547,XXVII.,"By the peasant's hearthstone, or the cottager's door."
9548,XXVII.,There she paused: and her accents seem'd dipp'd in the hue
9549,XXVII.,"Of his own sombre heart, as the picture she drew"
9550,XXVII.,"Of the poor, proud, sad spirit, rejecting love's wages,"
9551,XXVII.,Yet working love's work; reading backwards life's pages
9552,XXVII.,"For penance; and stubbornly, many a time,"
9553,XXVII.,"Both missing the moral, and marring the rhyme."
9554,XXVII.,"Then she spoke of the soldier!... the man's work and fame,"
9555,XXVII.,"The pride of a nation, a world's just acclaim!"
9556,XXVII.,Life's inward approval!
9557,XXVII.,
9558,XXVII.,
9559,XXVIII.,XXVIII.
9560,XXVIII.,
9561,XXVIII.,
9562,XXVIII.,"Her voice reach'd his heart,"
9563,XXVIII.,"And sank lower.  She spoke of herself: how, apart"
9564,XXVIII.,"And unseen,--far away,--she had watch'd, year by year,"
9565,XXVIII.,"With how many a blessing, how many a tear,"
9566,XXVIII.,"And how many a prayer, every stage in the strife:"
9567,XXVIII.,Guess'd the thought in the deed: traced the love in the life:
9568,XXVIII.,Bless'd the man in the man's work!
9569,XXVIII.,"""THY work... oh, not mine!"
9570,XXVIII.,"Thine, Lucile!""... he exclaim'd... ""all the worth of it thine,"
9571,XXVIII.,"If worth there be in it!"""
9572,XXVIII.,Her answer convey'd
9573,XXVIII.,"His reward, and her own: joy that cannot be said"
9574,XXVIII.,Alone by the voice... eyes--face--spoke silently:
9575,XXVIII.,"All the woman, one grateful emotion!"
9576,XXVIII.,And she
9577,XXVIII.,A poor Sister of Charity! hers a life spent
9578,XXVIII.,In one silent effort for others!...
9579,XXVIII.,She bent
9580,XXVIII.,"Her divine face above him, and fill'd up his heart"
9581,XXVIII.,With the look that glow'd from it.
9582,XXVIII.,"Then slow, with soft art,"
9583,XXVIII.,"Fix'd her aim, and moved to it."
9584,XXVIII.,
9585,XXVIII.,
9586,XXIX.,XXIX.
9587,XXIX.,
9588,XXIX.,
9589,XXIX.,"He, the soldier humane,"
9590,XXIX.,"He, the hero; whose heart hid in glory the pain"
9591,XXIX.,Of a youth disappointed; whose life had made known
9592,XXIX.,The value of man's life!... that youth overthrown
9593,XXIX.,"And retrieved, had it left him no pity for youth"
9594,XXIX.,In another? his own life of strenuous truth
9595,XXIX.,"Accomplish'd in act, had it taught him no care"
9596,XXIX.,For the life of another?... oh no! everywhere
9597,XXIX.,"In the camp which she moved through, she came face to face"
9598,XXIX.,"With some noble token, some generous trace"
9599,XXIX.,Of his active humanity...
9600,XXIX.,"""Well,"" he replied,"
9601,XXIX.,"""If it be so?"""
9602,XXIX.,"""I come from the solemn bedside"
9603,XXIX.,"Of a man that is dying,"" she said.  ""While we speak,"
9604,XXIX.,"A life is in jeopardy."""
9605,XXIX.,"""Quick then! you seek"
9606,XXIX.,"Aid or medicine, or what?"""
9607,XXIX.,"""'Tis not needed,"" she said."
9608,XXIX.,"""Medicine? yes, for the mind!  'Tis a heart that needs aid!"
9609,XXIX.,"You, Eugene de Luvois, you (and you only) can"
9610,XXIX.,"Save the life of this man.  Will you save it?"""
9611,XXIX.,"""What man?"
9612,XXIX.,"How?... where?... can you ask?"""
9613,XXIX.,She went rapidly on
9614,XXIX.,To her object in brief vivid words... The young son
9615,XXIX.,Of Matilda and Alfred--the boy lying there
9616,XXIX.,"Half a mile from that tent door--the father's despair,"
9617,XXIX.,The mother's deep anguish--the pride of the boy
9618,XXIX.,In the father--the father's one hope and one joy
9619,XXIX.,"In the son:---the son now--wounded, dying!  She told"
9620,XXIX.,"Of the father's stern struggle with life: the boy's bold,"
9621,XXIX.,"Pure, and beautiful nature: the fair life before him"
9622,XXIX.,If that life were but spared... yet a word might restore him!
9623,XXIX.,The boy's broken love for the niece of Eugene!
9624,XXIX.,"Its pathos: the girl's love for him; how, half slain"
9625,XXIX.,"In his tent, she had found him: won from him the tale;"
9626,XXIX.,Sought to nurse back his life; found her efforts still fail
9627,XXIX.,Beaten back by a love that was stronger than life;
9628,XXIX.,Of how bravely till then he had stood in that strife
9629,XXIX.,"Wherein England and France in their best blood, at last,"
9630,XXIX.,Had bathed from remembrance the wounds of the past.
9631,XXIX.,And shall nations be nobler than men?  Are not great
9632,XXIX.,Men the models of nations?  For what is a state
9633,XXIX.,But the many's confused imitation of one?
9634,XXIX.,"Shall he, the fair hero of France, on the son"
9635,XXIX.,"Of his ally seek vengeance, destroying perchance"
9636,XXIX.,"An innocent life,--here, when England and France"
9637,XXIX.,"Have forgiven the sins of their fathers of yore,"
9638,XXIX.,And baptized a new hope in their sons' recent gore?
9639,XXIX.,She went on to tell how the boy had clung still
9640,XXIX.,"To life, for the sake of life's uses, until"
9641,XXIX.,"From his weak hands the strong effort dropp'd, stricken down"
9642,XXIX.,"By the news that the heart of Constance, like his own,"
9643,XXIX.,Was breaking beneath...
9644,XXIX.,"But there ""Hold!"" he exclaim'd,"
9645,XXIX.,"Interrupting, ""Forbear!""... his whole face was inflamed"
9646,XXIX.,"With the heart's swarthy thunder which yet, while she spoke,"
9647,XXIX.,Had been gathering silent--at last the storm broke
9648,XXIX.,In grief or in wrath...
9649,XXIX.,"""'Tis to him, then,"" he cried,..."
9650,XXIX.,"Checking suddenly short the tumultuous stride,"
9651,XXIX.,"""That I owe these late greetings--for him you are here--"
9652,XXIX.,"For his sake you seek me--for him, it is clear,"
9653,XXIX.,You have deign'd at the last to bethink you again
9654,XXIX.,"Of this long-forgotten existence!"""
9655,XXIX.,"""Eugene!"""
9656,XXIX.,"""Ha! fool that I was!""... he went on,... ""and just now,"
9657,XXIX.,"While you spoke yet, my heart was beginning to grow"
9658,XXIX.,"Almost boyish again, almost sure of ONE friend!"
9659,XXIX.,Yet this was the meaning of all--this the end!
9660,XXIX.,Be it so!  There's a sort of slow justice (admit!)
9661,XXIX.,In this--that the word that man's finger hath writ
9662,XXIX.,"In fire on my heart, I return him at last."
9663,XXIX.,"Let him learn that word--Never!"""
9664,XXIX.,"""Ah, still to the past"
9665,XXIX.,"Must the present be vassal?"" she said.  ""In the hour"
9666,XXIX.,We last parted I urged you to put forth the power
9667,XXIX.,"Which I felt to be yours, in the conquest of life."
9668,XXIX.,"Yours, the promise to strive: mine--to watch o'er the strife."
9669,XXIX.,"I foresaw you would conquer; you HAVE conquer'd much,"
9670,XXIX.,"Much, indeed, that is noble!  I hail it as such,"
9671,XXIX.,And am here to record and applaud it.  I saw
9672,XXIX.,"Not the less in your nature, Eugene de Luvois,"
9673,XXIX.,One peril--one point where I feared you would fail
9674,XXIX.,"To subdue that worst foe which a man can assail,--"
9675,XXIX.,"Himself: and I promised that, if I should see"
9676,XXIX.,"My champion once falter, or bend the brave knee,"
9677,XXIX.,That moment would bring me again to his side.
9678,XXIX.,"That moment is come! for that peril was pride,"
9679,XXIX.,"And you falter.  I plead for yourself, and another,"
9680,XXIX.,"For that gentle child without father or mother,"
9681,XXIX.,"To whom you are both.  I plead, soldier of France,"
9682,XXIX.,"For your own nobler nature--and plead for Constance!"""
9683,XXIX.,At the sound of that name he averted his head.
9684,XXIX.,"""Constance!... Ay, she enter'd MY lone life"" (he said)"
9685,XXIX.,"""When its sun was long set; and hung over its night"
9686,XXIX.,"Her own starry childhood.  I have but that light,"
9687,XXIX.,In the midst of much darkness!  Who names me but she
9688,XXIX.,With titles of love?  And what rests there for me
9689,XXIX.,In the silence of age save the voice of that child?
9690,XXIX.,"The child of my own better life, undefiled!"
9691,XXIX.,"My creature, carved out of my heart of hearts!"""
9692,XXIX.,"""Say,"""
9693,XXIX.,"Said the Soeur Seraphine--""are you able to lay"
9694,XXIX.,Your hand as a knight on your heart as a man
9695,XXIX.,"And swear that, whatever may happen, you can"
9696,XXIX.,"Feel assured for the life you thus cherish?"""
9697,XXIX.,"""How so?"""
9698,XXIX.,"He look'd up.  ""if the boy should die thus?"""
9699,XXIX.,"""Yes, I know"
9700,XXIX.,What your look would imply... this sleek stranger forsooth!
9701,XXIX.,Because on his cheek was the red rose of youth
9702,XXIX.,"The heart of my niece must break for it!"""
9703,XXIX.,"She cried,"
9704,XXIX.,"""Nay, but hear me yet further!"""
9705,XXIX.,"With slow heavy stride,"
9706,XXIX.,"Unheeding her words, he was pacing the tent,"
9707,XXIX.,He was muttering low to himself as he went.
9708,XXIX.,"Ay, these young things lie safe in our heart just so long"
9709,XXIX.,As their wings are in growing; and when these are strong
9710,XXIX.,"They break it, and farewell! the bird flies!""..."
9711,XXIX.,The nun
9712,XXIX.,"Laid her hand on the soldier, and murmur'd, ""The sun"
9713,XXIX.,"Is descending, life fleets while we talk thus! oh, yet"
9714,XXIX.,"Let this day upon one final victory set,"
9715,XXIX.,"And complete a life's conquest!"""
9716,XXIX.,"He said, ""Understand!"
9717,XXIX.,"If Constance wed the son of this man, by whose hand"
9718,XXIX.,"My heart hath been robb'd, she is lost to my life!"
9719,XXIX.,Can her home be my home?  Can I claim in the wife
9720,XXIX.,Of that man's son the child of my age?  At her side
9721,XXIX.,Shall he stand on my hearth?  Shall I sue to the bride
9722,XXIX.,Of... enough!
9723,XXIX.,"""Ah, and you immemorial halls"
9724,XXIX.,"Of my Norman forefathers, whose shadow yet falls"
9725,XXIX.,"On my fancy, and fuses hope, memory, past,"
9726,XXIX.,"Present,--all, in one silence! old trees to the blast"
9727,XXIX.,"Of the North Sea repeating the tale of old days,"
9728,XXIX.,"Nevermore, nevermore in the wild bosky ways"
9729,XXIX.,Shall I hear through your umbrage ancestral the wind
9730,XXIX.,"Prophesy as of yore, when it shook the deep mind"
9731,XXIX.,"Of my boyhood, with whispers from out the far years"
9732,XXIX.,"Of love, fame, the raptures life cools down with tears!"
9733,XXIX.,Henceforth shall the tread of a Vargrave alone
9734,XXIX.,"Rouse your echoes?"""
9735,XXIX.,"""O think not,"" she said, ""of the son"
9736,XXIX.,Of the man whom unjustly you hate; only think
9737,XXIX.,"Of this young human creature, that cries from the brink"
9738,XXIX.,Of a grave to your mercy!
9739,XXIX.,"""Recall your own words"
9740,XXIX.,(Words my memory mournfully ever records!)
9741,XXIX.,"How with love may be wreck'd a whole life! then, Eugene,"
9742,XXIX.,Look with me (still those words in our ears!) once again
9743,XXIX.,At this young soldier sinking from life here--dragg'd down
9744,XXIX.,"By the weight of the love in his heart: no renown,"
9745,XXIX.,No fame comforts HIM! nations shout not above
9746,XXIX.,The lone grave down to which he is bearing the love
9747,XXIX.,Which life has rejected!  Will YOU stand apart?
9748,XXIX.,"You, with such a love's memory deep in your heart!"
9749,XXIX.,"You the hero, whose life hath perchance been led on"
9750,XXIX.,"Through the deeds it hath wrought to the fame it hath won,"
9751,XXIX.,"By recalling the visions and dreams of a youth,"
9752,XXIX.,"Such as lies at your door now: who have but, in truth,"
9753,XXIX.,"To stretch forth a hand, to speak only one word,"
9754,XXIX.,"And by that word you rescue a life!"""
9755,XXIX.,He was stirr'd.
9756,XXIX.,"Still he sought to put from him the cup, bow'd his face"
9757,XXIX.,"on his hand; and anon, as though wishing to chase"
9758,XXIX.,"With one angry gesture his own thoughts aside,"
9759,XXIX.,"He sprang up, brush'd past her, and bitterly cried,"
9760,XXIX.,"""No!--Constance wed a Vargrave!""--I cannot consent!"""
9761,XXIX.,Then up rose the Soeur Seraphine.
9762,XXIX.,The low tent
9763,XXIX.,"In her sudden uprising, seem'd dwarf'd by the height"
9764,XXIX.,From which those imperial eyes pour'd the light
9765,XXIX.,Of their deep silent sadness upon him.
9766,XXIX.,No wonder
9767,XXIX.,"He felt, as it were, his own stature shrink under"
9768,XXIX.,The compulsion of that grave regard!  For between
9769,XXIX.,The Duc de Luvois and the Soeur Seraphine
9770,XXIX.,At that moment there rose all the height of one soul
9771,XXIX.,O'er another; she look'd down on him from the whole
9772,XXIX.,"Lonely length of a life.  There were sad nights and days,"
9773,XXIX.,There were long months and years in that heart-searching gaze;
9774,XXIX.,"And her voice, when she spoke, with sharp pathos thrill'd through"
9775,XXIX.,And transfix'd him.
9776,XXIX.,"""Eugene de Luvois, but for you,"
9777,XXIX.,"I might have been now--not this wandering nun,"
9778,XXIX.,"But a mother, a wife--pleading, not for the son"

9780,XXIX.,"His,--the man's that I once loved!... Hush! that which is done"
9781,XXIX.,I regret not.  I breathe no reproaches.  That's best
9782,XXIX.,Which God sends.  'Twas his will: it is mine.  And the rest
9783,XXIX.,Of that riddle I will not look back to.  He reads
9784,XXIX.,In your heart--He that judges of all thoughts and deeds.
9785,XXIX.,"With eyes, mine forestall not!  This only I say:"
9786,XXIX.,"You have not the right (read it, you, as you may!)"
9787,XXIX.,"To say... 'I am the wrong'd.""'..."
9788,XXIX.,"""Have I wrong'd thee?--wrong'd THEE!"""
9789,XXIX.,"He falter'd, ""Lucile, ah, Lucile!"""
9790,XXIX.,"""Nay, not me,"""
9791,XXIX.,"She murmur'd, ""but man!  The lone nun standing here"
9792,XXIX.,"Has no claim upon earth, and is pass'd from the sphere"
9793,XXIX.,"Of earth's wrongs and earth's reparations.  But she,"
9794,XXIX.,"The dead woman, Lucile, she whose grave is in me,"
9795,XXIX.,"Demands from her grave reparation to man,"
9796,XXIX.,"Reparation to God.  Heed, O heed, while you can,"

9798,XXIX.,"""Hush!"" he moan'd, ""I obey"
9799,XXIX.,"The Soeur Seraphine.  There, Lucile! let this pay"
9800,XXIX.,Every debt that is due to that grave.  Now lead on:

9802,XXIX.,"Of Lord Alfred Vargrave... and then,""..."
9803,XXIX.,As he spoke

9806,XXIX.,Of the city beneath them...
9807,XXIX.,"""Then, THERE, underground,"

9823,XXX.,"(Himself the wan spectre of youth), with eyes bent"

10005,THE DUKE.,"If your own frank young heart, yet unconscious of all"

10018,THE DUKE.,"Whilst he spoke thus, a doubtful tumultuous joy"

10020,THE DUKE.,"As when some stormy moon, in a long cloud confined,"
10021,THE DUKE.,"Struggles outward through shadows, the varying wind"
10022,THE DUKE.,"Alternates, and bursts, self-surprised, from her prison,"

10025,THE DUKE.,"A strange, happy feebleness trembled through him."
10026,THE DUKE.,"With a faint cry of rapturous wonder, he sank"
10027,THE DUKE.,"On the breast of the nun, who stood near."
10028,THE DUKE.,"""Yes, boy! thank"

10035,THE DUKE.,Back again the faint head

10039,THE DUKE.,He eyed
