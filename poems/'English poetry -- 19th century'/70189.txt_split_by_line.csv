61,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
62,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,When Shelley wrote THE SENSITIVE PLANT he was drawing very near the
63,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,end of his poetry. It was one of the poems belonging to the days at
64,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"Pisa, whither the Shelleys had gone late in the January of 1820. In the"
65,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"next winter—a winter of many painful associations for him, and many"
66,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,discouragements and reminders of evil fortune—he wrote this mysterious
67,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,song of beauty and death. The idea of it appears to have come to him
68,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,from the flowers which Mrs. Shelley had collected round her in her own
69,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,room at the house they occupied on the south side of the Arno. Their
70,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"fragrance, as it exhaled on the wintry Italian sunshine, and the"
71,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"sense of their fading loveliness, added to certain graver influences"
72,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"of which we read,—the death of a dearly-loved child, the illness of"
73,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"a dear friend,—contributed, no doubt, to provide that “atmosphere of"
74,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"memorial dejection and very sorrowful delight,” of which an old Italian"
75,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"poet speaks, as being propitious for the working of the imagination."
76,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,But a miracle is not less miraculous because we know the conditions
77,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"under which it was worked, and something inexplicable remains about THE"
78,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,SENSITIVE PLANT after we have gathered together everything we can of its
79,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,circumstances and the moods of its poet in the memorable Pisan days when
80,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,it was written.
81,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
82,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"All through this period, so far as we can gather, Shelley was extremely"
83,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,discouraged about his poetry and the reception it had attained hitherto.
84,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,From Medwin and others we learn of the special resentment he felt at
85,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,the continual hostilities of the powerful quarterly engines of critical
86,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"opinion. In a letter to Ollier, he said, during 1820: “I doubt whether I"
87,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,shall write more. I could be content either with the hell or the paradise
88,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"of poetry, but the torments of its purgatory vex me without exciting my"
89,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"powers sufficiently to put an end to the vexation.” However, when a poet"
90,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"of Shelley’s plenary inspiration decides not to write, he is likely to"
91,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,be impelled most strongly by his _dæmon_ to new flights. The “Ode to a
92,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"Skylark,” the “Witch of Atlas,” the “Ode to Liberty,” among other poems,"
93,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,belong to this period; and with them we have the invincible declaration
94,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"of the poet’s rights and inalienable liberties, to be found in his"
95,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,prose “Defence of Poetry.” One or two stanzas there are in the “Witch
96,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"of Atlas,” and one or two passages in the “Defence,” which strike us"
97,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,as being more intimately connected with the occult imaginative origins
98,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,of THE SENSITIVE PLANT than anything found elsewhere in his writings.
99,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"Take the strange, melodious verses in which the radiant creature of the"
100,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"mountains is presented,—the lovely lady garmented in the light of her own"
101,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"beauty, to whom the camelopard and the brindled lioness, the herdsmen"
102,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,and the mountain maidens came:
103,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
104,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,“_For she was beautiful: her beauty made_
105,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"_The bright world dim, and everything beside_"
106,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,_Seemed like the fleeting image of a shade:_
107,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,_No thought of living spirit could abide_
108,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,_(Which to her looks had ever been betrayed)_
109,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"_On any object in the world so wide,_"
110,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"_On any hope within the circling skies,_"
111,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"_But in her form, and in her inmost eyes._"
112,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
113,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,*       *       *       *       *
114,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
115,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,“_The deep recesses of her odorous dwelling_
116,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"_Were stored with magic treasures—sounds of air,_"
117,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"_Which had the power all spirits of compelling,_"
118,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,_Folded in cells of crystal silence there._”
119,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
120,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,*       *       *       *       *
121,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
122,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"A few stanzas later, and we come to the idea of the strange seed, which"
123,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"was wrapt in mould, and watered all the summer with sweet dew. At length:"
124,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
125,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,“_The plant grew strong and green—the sunny flower_
126,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"_Fell, and the long and gourd-like fruit began_"
127,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,_To turn the light and dew by inward power_
128,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,_To its own substance._”
129,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
130,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"This brings us as near, I imagine, to the idea of THE SENSITIVE PLANT"
131,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,as we are likely to find ourselves in any other most Shelleyan region
132,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,of his poetry. The lines recur persistently to the mind in reading the
133,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,later poem; and almost as suggestively is it haunted by one passage at
134,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"least in the “Defence,” which speaks with a sort of aerial eloquence of a"
135,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,Poetry whose art it is to arrest “the vanishing apparitions which haunt
136,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"the interlunations of life, and veiling them, or in language or in form,"
137,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,sends them forth among mankind bearing sweet news of kindred joy to
138,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,those with whom their sisters abide.”
139,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
140,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,When one considers the rarity and the half-impalpable conditions of this
141,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"chosen realm of his poetry, and turns to THE SENSITIVE PLANT as one of"
142,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"its most essential expressions, one is at first rendered half-incredulous"
143,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"of the power of a kindred art to interpret effectively such a poem. But,"
144,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"in fact, there is a much more concrete imagery—whether of flowers or"
145,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"weeds, directly presented or definitely symbolised; or of the Lady who"
146,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,haunts among them—than one at all remembers until one takes to conning
147,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,its stanzas closely with an eye to such effects.
148,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
149,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,THE SENSITIVE PLANT lends itself more readily to the art of the
150,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"symbolist, in particular, than any other of Shelley’s poems. It would be"
151,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"quite possible for a critic with a turn for metaphysics, and a certain"
152,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"German patience of analytic ingenuity, to read into its exquisite fable"
153,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"of mortality a whole world of significance, which the poet himself had"
154,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"never suspected. But the symbolic artist, if he be too, as needs be,"
155,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"a symbolic poet, is saved by his art. The spirit of the poem is likely"
156,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"to obsess him, and compel from him only such an interpretation as is,"
157,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,allowing for the casual differences of kindred arts and sympathetic
158,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"temperaments, truly and finely accordant with its own essential qualities"
159,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,and terms of expression. The true poets have that power of continuing to
160,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,enlarge the original issues and influences of their song long after its
161,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,immediate effect has died away. Shelley commands with a more than usual
162,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"lyric enchantment a sphere that, like the magic house of Merlin, can go"
163,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"on enlarging itself; until one figures him, not as the sad spirit of the"
164,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"garden in this poem, but as the radiant spirit of his “Hymn of Apollo”:"
165,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,
166,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"“_All harmony of instrument or verse,_"
167,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,"_All prophecy, all medicine are mine,_"
168,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,_All light of art or nature—to my song_
169,THE SENSITIVE PLANT,_Victory and praise in their own right belong._”

179,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,In one sense a beautiful poem can never be illustrated: being beautiful
180,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"it is already perfect, and, to intelligent minds, illustrates itself."
181,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,Everything that it says it says in the best possible way; within the
182,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"limits of the medium chosen, it is absolute."
183,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,
184,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"If, therefore, illustration is to be an attempt to say over again what"
185,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"the poet has already said perfectly, it is certain to prove itself"
186,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"superfluous, and to be nothing better than a labour of tautology."
187,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,But there is a quality in all fine work which gives invitation into
188,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,the charmed circle of its influence to whatever is freshly and
189,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,sympathetically touched with the ideas it conveys. Great work tells so
190,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,differently on different minds; not by contrary but by kindred ways it
191,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,speaks freshly perhaps to each individual.
192,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,
193,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"Thus, to express accurately in another medium an appreciation, an"
194,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,individual sense of delight or emotion in work of finished and
195,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,constructive beauty is the only way of illustration which seems to me
196,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,profitable. The appreciation may be faulty; but in so far as it states a
197,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"personal view of its subject, it has legitimate standing ground."
198,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,
199,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,I have endeavoured to make evident in my drawings the particular way
200,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"in which this poem has appealed to me. The garden, fine and elaborate,"
201,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"full of artifice, opposing with an infinity of delicate labour the"
202,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,random overgrowth of the wilderness which seeks jealously to encroach
203,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"on it, has perhaps this to hint concerning all forms of beauty of man’s"
204,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"devising,—that, in spite of the pains entailed in their cultivation, the"
205,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,fragile and conditional state of their constitution remains: over all
206,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"such things at last comes the tread of Pan, effacing, and replacing with"
207,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"his own image and superscription, the parenthetic grace—so spiritual"
208,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,almost in some of its suggestions—of the garden deity.
209,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,
210,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"The lady of the garden, the charming sentimentalist, whom I can only"
211,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,excuse for not killing the slugs and snails by believing that she wore
212,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"a crinoline and was altogether ignorant of natural laws, harmonises"
213,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,exquisitely for a while with her high-clipped hedges and garden statuary.
214,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,It is an _ensemble_ to gaze into as into a picture: but the shadows of
215,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,ruin and decay cross it; it is too graceful to last. Pan is stronger than
216,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,any form of beauty that springs out of modes and fashions.
217,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,
218,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"So, when she dies, she is but the forerunner of the death of the whole"
219,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,garden: when she evaporates the _petite mort_ runs through all its bowers
220,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,and alleys: its apparitions rise and follow her funeral with a sense that
221,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,their own time of dissolution approaches; and the mode passes through
222,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,a period of squalor and morbid abandonment back into the hands of the
223,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,ultimate master of things earthly.
224,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,
225,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"It is an unpopular thing, may be, to assert that man’s sense of beauty"
226,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,is so conditional to himself and the uses he makes of it. Yet here we
227,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"are shown how, with war to the death, unsightly overthrow follows his"
228,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"abandonment of his stolen pleasure-ground, and wipes out his trespassing"
229,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,footprints.
230,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,
231,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,Man’s sense of beauty is his own: it is not Nature’s. The aim of all
232,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"art is to restrict Nature, and teach her that her place is not in the"
233,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,high places of men; and we only admire Nature because in the present
234,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,strength of our civilisation we are strong enough to pet her. Hannibal
235,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,was a better judge of the true unsightliness of Alpine scenery than we
236,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,ourselves.
237,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,
238,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,I should have preferred to add nothing to what I have drawn: but an
239,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,explanation of my unkind view of the rival claims of Pan and the
240,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,Garden-god has been wrung from me.
241,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,
242,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"For the present the genius of civilisation, numerating duration into"
243,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"hours and years and centuries for man’s convenience, overrides the"
244,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,slow-crawling tortoise of Time: but it will not always be so; and earth
245,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,will come at last to be altogether rid of us and that superfluous “sense
246,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,"of beauty” which has so long yoked her back, and hedged her wastes and"
247,A NOTE UPON THE ILLUSTRATIONS,furrowed her fields.
