347,DAGONET DITTIES.,But when midnight rang out from the steeple
348,DAGONET DITTIES.,"I ventured to whisper a prayer,"

389,DAGONET DITTIES.,"The fisher-folk spied him miles away,"

391,DAGONET DITTIES.,"They rowed the lifeboat across the bay,"

393,DAGONET DITTIES.,
394,DAGONET DITTIES.,"The artist had sunk for the second time,"
395,DAGONET DITTIES.,"He’d a shark on his starboard tack,"

405,DAGONET DITTIES.,But he soon got better and stole away
406,DAGONET DITTIES.,To the house of a local leech.
407,DAGONET DITTIES.,"He took a draught, and he went to bed"
408,DAGONET DITTIES.,In a garret that was to spare;

411,DAGONET DITTIES.,
412,DAGONET DITTIES.,"He was up in a garret against the sky,"

415,DAGONET DITTIES.,And he heard the people shout.
416,DAGONET DITTIES.,"“Oh, come to the window!” the people cried,"
417,DAGONET DITTIES.,As they bellowed a mighty cheer;
418,DAGONET DITTIES.,"“You’d better come down before you’re fried,"
419,DAGONET DITTIES.,For the fire-escape is here.”
420,DAGONET DITTIES.,
421,DAGONET DITTIES.,"He opened the casement wide, and reeled"
422,DAGONET DITTIES.,Back through the flame and smoke--
423,DAGONET DITTIES.,For the fire-escape the light revealed--
424,DAGONET DITTIES.,And then to the crowd he spoke:

430,DAGONET DITTIES.,They gathered him up with a broom and pan
431,DAGONET DITTIES.,"From the pavement where he fell,"
432,DAGONET DITTIES.,"And they sent for the undertaker’s man,"
433,DAGONET DITTIES.,And they toll’d him a passing bell.
434,DAGONET DITTIES.,"They gave him a funeral plain but good,"
435,DAGONET DITTIES.,And out of the local purse
436,DAGONET DITTIES.,"They bought him a coffin of polished wood,"
437,DAGONET DITTIES.,Which they put in a pair-horse hearse.
438,DAGONET DITTIES.,
439,DAGONET DITTIES.,"But the artist-spirit in death was strong,"
440,DAGONET DITTIES.,And it lifted the coffin-lid
441,DAGONET DITTIES.,"While the horses lazily jogged along,"
442,DAGONET DITTIES.,And out of the hearse it slid.

750,(THE NEW VERSION.),"He thought of all the vows he’d broken,"
751,(THE NEW VERSION.),"He thought of falsehoods lightly told,"
752,(THE NEW VERSION.),"Of all the hasty words he’d spoken,"

881,(THE NEW VERSION.),She dropped them (they were not her own)
882,(THE NEW VERSION.),Inside the pillar-box.
883,(THE NEW VERSION.),

2481,ENVOY.,He gaily donned his uniform--
2482,ENVOY.,Such portions as he had--
2483,ENVOY.,And then went out into the storm;
2484,ENVOY.,The night was very bad.
2485,ENVOY.,
2486,ENVOY.,"The snowflakes fell as large as eggs,"
2487,ENVOY.,The blast his bosom smote;
2488,ENVOY.,"He had no trousers on his legs,"
2489,ENVOY.,He had no overcoat.
2490,ENVOY.,
2491,ENVOY.,"His heart was full of brave intent,"
2492,ENVOY.,He started at a trot;
2493,ENVOY.,"But O, he shivered as he went--"
2494,ENVOY.,Il n’avait pas de bottes!
2495,ENVOY.,
2496,ENVOY.,"Ten thousand strong in legs all bare,"
2497,ENVOY.,"And only in their socks,"
2498,ENVOY.,"Our fellows made the Frenchmen stare,"
2499,ENVOY.,Yet stood their ground like rocks.
2500,ENVOY.,
2501,ENVOY.,"But when the Frenchmen saw the foe,"
2502,ENVOY.,"Our noble Volunteers,"
2503,ENVOY.,"They laughed “Ha, ha!” and yelled “Ho, ho!”"
2504,ENVOY.,And greeted them with sneers.
2505,ENVOY.,
2506,ENVOY.,"“C’est drôle,” they cried; “c’est bien drôle,"
2507,ENVOY.,"Cette armée sans culottes,”"
2508,ENVOY.,"And Alphonse yelled to Anatole,"
2509,ENVOY.,“Ils n’ont donc pas de bottes.”
2510,ENVOY.,
2511,ENVOY.,"The British blushed with bitter shame,"
2512,ENVOY.,"Their feelings were acute,"
2513,ENVOY.,"And, though they were extremely game,"
2514,ENVOY.,They felt too pained to shoot.
2515,ENVOY.,
2516,ENVOY.,"Their wail was borne upon the breeze,"
2517,ENVOY.,"“The foe our army mocks,”"
2518,ENVOY.,"But still the cold benumbed their knees,"
2519,ENVOY.,The snow soaked through their socks.
2520,ENVOY.,
2521,ENVOY.,And so because they weren’t equipped
2522,ENVOY.,"As Volunteers should be,"
2523,ENVOY.,"The well-clad Frenchmen by them skipped,"
2524,ENVOY.,And it was all U P.
2525,ENVOY.,
2526,ENVOY.,"O Britons, for your country’s sake,"
2527,ENVOY.,"And all you hold most dear,"
2528,ENVOY.,"A lesson from this story take,"
2529,ENVOY.,And clothe the Volunteer.
2530,ENVOY.,
2531,ENVOY.,"For trousers, boots, and overcoats"
2532,ENVOY.,To Lord Mayor Whitehead hand
2533,ENVOY.,"A cheque or Bank of England notes,"
2534,ENVOY.,And save your native land.
2535,ENVOY.,
2536,ENVOY.,
2537,ENVOY.,
2538,ENVOY.,
2539,ENVOY.,Those Boots.
2540,ENVOY.,
2541,ENVOY.,
2542,ENVOY.,"Our Prince a little change would seek,"
2543,ENVOY.,To town a short adieu he bids;
2544,ENVOY.,"In Paris spends his Whitsun week,"
2545,ENVOY.,And takes “the missus and the kids.”
2546,ENVOY.,At Dover on the deck he stands
2547,ENVOY.,"(See ad.--“The shortest of sea routes”),"
2548,ENVOY.,And hies him o’er to Calais sands
2549,ENVOY.,In tourist tweed and untanned boots.
2550,ENVOY.,
2551,ENVOY.,"The cares of State no longer vex,"
2552,ENVOY.,"From Fashion’s whirl he steps aside,"
2553,ENVOY.,"And takes a trip, our future Rex,"
2554,ENVOY.,And with him goes his silver bride.
2555,ENVOY.,They take their boys and girls to see
2556,ENVOY.,"The show no sceptred hand salutes,"
2557,ENVOY.,"And start, from princely trammels free,"
2558,ENVOY.,In tourist tweeds and untanned boots.
2559,ENVOY.,
2560,ENVOY.,Prince! standing in the blazing light
2561,ENVOY.,"That beats upon a modern throne,"
2562,ENVOY.,"’Tis not in royal robes bedight,"
2563,ENVOY.,"I ween, your happiest hours are known."
2564,ENVOY.,The white stones on your road of life
2565,ENVOY.,"Mark where you pluck sweet leisure’s fruits,"
2566,ENVOY.,And with your boys and girls and wife
2567,ENVOY.,Go trips in tweeds and untanned boots.
2568,ENVOY.,
2569,ENVOY.,
2570,ENVOY.,
2571,ENVOY.,
2572,ENVOY.,A Sunday Song.
2573,ENVOY.,
2574,ENVOY.,
2575,ENVOY.,I stood and I shivered last Sunday night
2576,ENVOY.,"Till I bade them set the fire alight,"
2577,ENVOY.,"Then I sat with my feet on the fender bar,"
2578,ENVOY.,And I told them to bring me the whisky jar.
2579,ENVOY.,"I filled me a glass, and I held it high"
2580,ENVOY.,"As I glared at the gray and the gloomy sky,"
2581,ENVOY.,And I sang to a sad funereal tune
2582,ENVOY.,The doleful dirge of an English June.
2583,ENVOY.,
2584,ENVOY.,"“O gruesome herald of Whitsun week,”"
2585,ENVOY.,"I cried as I gazed on the prospect bleak,"
2586,ENVOY.,“The blazing heat of our one hot day
2587,ENVOY.,Has fried us up and has passed away;
2588,ENVOY.,And the weary summer of blights and chills
2589,ENVOY.,"Has come to us big with its thousand ills,"
2590,ENVOY.,And the lips of the lovers are blue who spoon
2591,ENVOY.,In Regent’s Park in our English June.”
2592,ENVOY.,
2593,ENVOY.,"A red nose pressed to the window-pane,"
2594,ENVOY.,"The swirling dust and the threatening rain,"
2595,ENVOY.,"A blue-black blight in the raw rough air,"
2596,ENVOY.,A cut-throat climate and dull despair;
2597,ENVOY.,"A tear for the days that will come no more,"
2598,ENVOY.,A dose of physic at twelve and four.
2599,ENVOY.,And that is my Sunday afternoon
2600,ENVOY.,In the Arctic arms of an English June.
2601,ENVOY.,
2602,ENVOY.,
2603,ENVOY.,
2604,ENVOY.,
2605,ENVOY.,Up the Rigi.
2606,ENVOY.,
2607,ENVOY.,
2608,ENVOY.,Riding up the mountain
2609,ENVOY.,"In an open car,"
2610,ENVOY.,Engine puffing bravely--
2611,ENVOY.,"O, how high we are!"
2612,ENVOY.,"Higher we are climbing,"
2613,ENVOY.,To the clouds we sail;
2614,ENVOY.,All the world’s beneath us
2615,ENVOY.,On the Rigi Rail.
2616,ENVOY.,
2617,ENVOY.,"Past the slopes of verdure,"
2618,ENVOY.,"Gay with gold and white,"
2619,ENVOY.,"Past the crags and fissures,"
2620,ENVOY.,Up the giddy height.
2621,ENVOY.,Torrents down below us
2622,ENVOY.,"Dashing through the vale,"
2623,ENVOY.,"Snowclad peaks above us,"
2624,ENVOY.,On the Rigi Rail.
2625,ENVOY.,
2626,ENVOY.,"Up, still up to cloudland,"
2627,ENVOY.,While the world below
2628,ENVOY.,Shrinks to dots and pigmies
2629,ENVOY.,Higher as we go.
2630,ENVOY.,All around grows barren;
2631,ENVOY.,Timid girls grow pale
2632,ENVOY.,As the snow surrounds us
2633,ENVOY.,On the Rigi Rail.
2634,ENVOY.,
2635,ENVOY.,Up at last--the summit
2636,ENVOY.,"Puffing Billy gains,"
2637,ENVOY.,And the sight that greets us
2638,ENVOY.,Pays for all our pains.
2639,ENVOY.,"Alp on alp far stretching,"
2640,ENVOY.,Lake and plain and vale
2641,ENVOY.,Spread in glory round us
2642,ENVOY.,On the Rigi Rail.
2643,ENVOY.,
2644,ENVOY.,Nerves with joy are thrilling
2645,ENVOY.,"In that wondrous air,"
2646,ENVOY.,Ne’er did eyes enchanted
2647,ENVOY.,See a sight so fair.
2648,ENVOY.,Ne’er till memory falters
2649,ENVOY.,And my senses fail
2650,ENVOY.,Shall I forget that journey
2651,ENVOY.,Upon the Rigi Rail.

2661,ENVOY.,Or in a little drunken huff
2662,ENVOY.,Prods children with a knife.
2663,ENVOY.,"O, do not flog the brute who takes"
2664,ENVOY.,The old man by the throat
2665,ENVOY.,And chokes him while a search he makes
2666,ENVOY.,"Of trousers, vest, and coat."
2667,ENVOY.,
2668,ENVOY.,"O, do not flog the coward cur"
2669,ENVOY.,Who pulps a woman’s face;
2670,ENVOY.,"It cannot do much good to her,"
2671,ENVOY.,And think of _his_ disgrace.
2672,ENVOY.,"O, think of all the smart and pain"
2673,ENVOY.,If his poor hide be thin;
2674,ENVOY.,"The cat, you know, must leave a stain"
2675,ENVOY.,On mind as well as skin.
2676,ENVOY.,
2677,ENVOY.,"O, do not flog the prowling wretch"
2678,ENVOY.,"Who bashes us for pelf,"
2679,ENVOY.,"But some nice kind old parson fetch,"
2680,ENVOY.,Or talk to him yourself.
2681,ENVOY.,"Present him with a kindly tract,"
2682,ENVOY.,Or pray with him awhile;
2683,ENVOY.,Explain that skulls should not be crackt
2684,ENVOY.,In such a shocking style.
2685,ENVOY.,
2686,ENVOY.,And when you’ve turned his wrath away
2687,ENVOY.,"And shown him he was wrong,"
2688,ENVOY.,"Then teach him, if you’ve time to stay,"
2689,ENVOY.,Some sweet Salvation song.
2690,ENVOY.,Far better let ten thousand such
2691,ENVOY.,"Go free to bash again,"
2692,ENVOY.,Than one should know the cat’s vile touch
2693,ENVOY.,Or feel a moment’s pain.
2694,ENVOY.,
2695,ENVOY.,"O, do not flog--in mercy spare"
2696,ENVOY.,The burglar’s tender hide.
2697,ENVOY.,"Though murder’s rife, what need we care?"
2698,ENVOY.,The Scripture’s on our side.
2699,ENVOY.,"Come then, ye bashing burglar crew,"
2700,ENVOY.,"Put up your sweet mouths--so,"
2701,ENVOY.,And let the cranks who plead for you

3124,III.,The corner I stood at passed by.
3125,III.,
3126,III.,I saw that his chain was a gold one;
3127,III.,I guessed that his watch was the same;
3128,III.,"And so, as the gent was an old one,"
3129,III.,I thought him legitimate game.
3130,III.,
3131,III.,"I’d got his gold chain in my fingers,"
3132,III.,"And was going to give it a tug,"
3133,III.,When whack came a couple of stingers--
3134,III.,Two beauties--and right on my lug.
3135,III.,
3136,III.,Then I’d one that struck stars from my peeper
3137,III.,And another that shifted my jaw--
3138,III.,A regular send-you-to-sleeper--
3139,III.,And that is the last that I saw.
3140,III.,
3141,III.,"The last that I saw till a peeler,"
3142,III.,"To fill sorrow’s cup to the brim,"
3143,III.,"Put my carcase inside a four-wheeler,"
3144,III.,"And said, “What a flat to try him!”"
3145,III.,
3146,III.,"“Who is he?” I groaned, as in torture"
3147,III.,I nervously felt for my face;
3148,III.,"And he said, “Well, you tackled a scorcher;"
3149,III.,That elderly gent was Jem Mace.”

3158,III.,"A tiny twirl of ’baccy grips,"
3159,III.,"And puffs a lazy cloud of blue,"
3160,III.,And rests between a draw or two.
3161,III.,"Our youth, alas! have grown of late"
3162,III.,"So languid and effeminate,"
3163,III.,They’ve dropped cigars and heavy wet
3164,III.,For lemon-squash and cigarette.
3165,III.,
3166,III.,The vulgar pipe is rarely seen
3167,III.,Their dainty lisping lips between;
3168,III.,"The dude would scorn a big cigar,"
3169,III.,His tout ensemble a weed would mar;
3170,III.,And so he rolls the paper toys
3171,III.,"We used to smoke as little boys,"
3172,III.,"And all the dressed-up, mashing set"
3173,III.,Affect the foreign cigarette.
3174,III.,
3175,III.,But now they tremble and go pale--
3176,III.,The doctors tell a dreadful tale.
3177,III.,A wretched fellow writes to say
3178,III.,They’d better throw such weeds away.
3179,III.,"Their faultless shirt-fronts quake with fear,"
3180,III.,And crease and tumble when they hear
3181,III.,They in their breasts a viper pet--
3182,III.,There’s poison in the cigarette.
3183,III.,
3184,III.,Go! let the foreign fellow puff
3185,III.,"His tissue-paper Turkish stuff,"
3186,III.,"But let Young England scorn its yoke,"
3187,III.,And once more like a Briton smoke
3188,III.,"Between his lips a good cigar,"

3198,III.,
3199,III.,I do not know what you are like--I know not where you go;
3200,III.,I’ve never seen you as you jolt along the streets below.
3201,III.,"It’s always in the early morn my house you rattle by,"
3202,III.,"And banish sleep that won’t return, however hard I try."
3203,III.,
3204,III.,"I wonder if the fiend, who drives like mad through Gower Street,"
3205,III.,"And on the asphalte likes to hear his horse’s heavy feet,"
3206,III.,"And bangs against the kerb and makes his swaying milk-cans crash,"
3207,III.,_Desires_ to settle straight away a nervous mortal’s hash.
3208,III.,
3209,III.,"Through weary hours I lie awake and toss from side to side,"
3210,III.,A genuine Jekyll tortured by a much too real Hyde;
3211,III.,"And when at last my drooping lids have shut that Hyde away,"
3212,III.,The early milk-cart rattles by and bids the demon stay.
3213,III.,
3214,III.,"You little reck, you noisy thing, as ’neath the fading stars"
3215,III.,"You jump and jolt, that every jerk on some poor toiler jars;"
3216,III.,"You little reck, as merrily your cans together bang,"
3217,III.,You’ve roused a serpent in my breast which has a poisoned fang.
3218,III.,
3219,III.,"All heedless of the web that fate has spun to hold me fast,"
3220,III.,Sometimes I sail o’er summer seas where ne’er a shadow’s cast;
3221,III.,"And youth and hope are mine again, and life’s a sweet green isle"
3222,III.,That sleeps upon the ocean’s breast and basks in heaven’s smile.
3223,III.,
3224,III.,"My lazy barque floats placidly towards that haven fair,"
3225,III.,"The sunny slopes grow nearer still--one moment, and I’m there;"
3226,III.,"One little leap from deck to shore--I wake with quite a start,"
3227,III.,The milk-cans dance a carmagnole upon that early cart.
3228,III.,
3229,III.,"Yet sometimes have I cause to bless the awful noise they make,"
3230,III.,’Tis when from some infernal dream their crashing bids me wake;
3231,III.,"When on my breast a demon sits, who’s marked me for his prey,"
3232,III.,I’m glad that milk-carts go about so early in the day.
3233,III.,
3234,III.,"Pass on, disturber of my rest--pass on thy way unseen;"
3235,III.,You little know how very near to murder you have been;
3236,III.,Your reckless driver never dreams how great has been his share
3237,III.,In making me the wreck I am--and p’r’aps he doesn’t care.
3238,III.,
3239,III.,"Yet when I sleep the dreamless sleep in that great silent town,"
3240,III.,Where ne’er a cart of any kind goes rattling up and down--
3241,III.,The coroner who sat on me may possibly suggest
3242,III.,That “Died of too much early milk” would suit my tombstone best.

3248,III.,
3249,III.,
3250,III.,Once on a time ’twas the freak of fate
3251,III.,"That Fidgitt and Whims should collaborate,"
3252,III.,So they sat them down on a midsummer day
3253,III.,To think of a plot and to write a play.
3254,III.,
3255,III.,"They both shook hands ere the task began,"
3256,III.,"Adopting the Prize Ring’s general plan,"
3257,III.,"And said, “If each other we chance to kill,"
3258,III.,"It isn’t a murder,” with right good will."
3259,III.,
3260,III.,"They buried their heads in their hands awhile,"
3261,III.,"Till Fidgitt looked up, with a sickly smile,"
3262,III.,"And timidly stammered a first rough plot,"
3263,III.,Which Whims immediately said was “rot.”
3264,III.,
3265,III.,"They buried their heads in their hands again,"
3266,III.,Till a notion fluttered in Whims’s brain;
3267,III.,"He got to the middle, and there he stuck,"
3268,III.,For Fidgitt declared the plot was “muck.”
3269,III.,
3270,III.,"They argued the point till it came to blows,"
3271,III.,"And Whims hit Fidgitt upon the nose,"
3272,III.,"Then Fidgitt the inkstand seized, and threw"
3273,III.,"At Whims’s head, which it split in two."
3274,III.,
3275,III.,"Then each in sorrow resumed his seat,"
3276,III.,"And their hands they wrung and their bosoms beat,"
3277,III.,"And presently Fidgitt, his cheeks aflame,"
3278,III.,With pride declared he’d the hero’s name.
3279,III.,
3280,III.,It wasn’t a name that Whims would keep
3281,III.,And he argued till Fidgitt began to weep.
3282,III.,"So Whims suggested a name instead,"
3283,III.,And that to another discussion led.
3284,III.,
3285,III.,"They flew at each other like angry cats,"
3286,III.,They tore their shirts and they crushed their hats;
3287,III.,"They smashed the table and broke the chairs,"
3288,III.,And kicked each other right down the stairs.
3289,III.,
3290,III.,"They banged each other against the wall,"
3291,III.,But made it up in the entrance-hall.
3292,III.,"They said they would go for a quiet walk,"
3293,III.,And begin again with a general talk.
3294,III.,
3295,III.,They talked so loudly in Bedford Square
3296,III.,"That the people about all stopped to stare,"
3297,III.,"And a poor little child from a window fell,"
3298,III.,In terror at hearing Whims’s yell.
3299,III.,
3300,III.,They called each other such dreadful names
3301,III.,"That they shocked a couple of aged dames,"
3302,III.,Who called a bobby to stop the din;
3303,III.,"He tried and couldn’t, so ran them in."
3304,III.,
3305,III.,They explained to the sitting magistrate
3306,III.,That they’d only tried to collaborate;
3307,III.,"But the magistrate said such scenes must cease,"
3308,III.,So he bound them over to keep the peace.
3309,III.,
3310,III.,"They promised they would, and they’ve got it still,"
3311,III.,For up to the present the “piece” is nil;
3312,III.,But see it finished perhaps we shall

3744,(A PASTORAL ROMANCE.),
3745,(A PASTORAL ROMANCE.),"Of Irish blood and Scotch descent,"

4243,(AFTER LORD TENNYSON.),And gave a little dinner.
4244,(AFTER LORD TENNYSON.),"The restaurant, a tip-top one,"
4245,(AFTER LORD TENNYSON.),"Was in the town that ‘Arry,"

4266,(AFTER LORD TENNYSON.),Without his host he’d reckoned--
4267,(AFTER LORD TENNYSON.),The friends of that proud Yankee girl

4271,(AFTER LORD TENNYSON.),By the side of a flowing river
4272,(AFTER LORD TENNYSON.),"That runs through the East of London town,"

4454,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"You are going white and yellow, and your lips are turning blue;”"

4457,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),
4458,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),For they knew the germs of fever were around them everywhere--
4459,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),They were told how very fatal was the family armchair;
4460,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),They were told that every morning when the slavey shook the mat
4461,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"Germs of death were scattered broadcast, and they shivered as they sat."
4462,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"They were told that death was lurking in the teapot and the tank,"

4464,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),In their terror ’gainst each other all the family did lean--
4465,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),Peace of mind had gone for ever from the Browns of Walham Green.

4467,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"From that day they took the _Lancet_, every week they read it through,"
4468,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),And their faces changed from rosy to a sickly yellow hue;
4469,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"And they could not eat their dinner, and they could not sleep at night,"
4470,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),For with every Friday’s _Lancet_ came a new and awful fright.
4471,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),Germs of all the fell diseases that lie lurking for mankind
4472,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"Were, according to the _Lancet_, blown on every passing wind;"

4480,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),It has even pierced the dustbin of the Browns of Walham Green!
4481,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),
4482,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"There, it told them, germs in thousands lay in waiting night and day,"
4483,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),So they went and threw carbolic in a wildly lavish way.
4484,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),Then it warned them in a leader that they’d better all look out
4485,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),For a dreadful epidemic that came down the waterspout;
4486,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"Up they went upon the housetop and poured quarts of Condy down,"
4487,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"Which they carried up in buckets--Mr., Miss, and Mrs. Brown--"
4488,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"And the neighbours stood and wondered what the dickens it could mean,"
4489,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),At the gath’ring on the housetop of the Browns of Walham Green.
4490,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),
4491,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"Every week came other terrors, every week their fears grew worse,"
4492,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"Till they felt their lives a burthen, till they felt their home a curse;"
4493,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"And they sat around the table with a look of nervous dread,"
4494,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),So upset by fears of dying that they wished that they were dead.
4495,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"And when they all were turning to mere bags of skin and bone,"
4496,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"And all the sound they uttered was a deep sepulchral groan,"
4497,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"Up rose young Tom, the eldest--a youth of seventeen--"
4498,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),And seized and flung the _Lancet_ right out on Walham Green.
4499,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),
4500,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"“Get out, you horrid bogey--you terrifying pest!”--"
4501,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),Exclaimed young Tom in anger as he flung it east and west.
4502,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"Then pa rose up, and, lifting his hand to heaven’s dome,"
4503,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),Swore that never more the _Lancet_ should come into the home.
4504,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"And from that hour there vanished their look of care and woe,"
4505,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),And all of them grew happy as in the long ago.
4506,(A MORAL POEM FOR CHILDREN.),"At germs they snap their fingers, and now with joyous mien"

4557,MORAL.,The record of his crimes.
4558,MORAL.,He knows his fingers he can snap
4559,MORAL.,At all ‘ye streete of Grubbe’;
4560,MORAL.,They haven’t riled the dear old chap--
4561,MORAL.,He warbles in his tub.
4562,MORAL.,
4563,MORAL.,"“There’s hope, he thinks, for Ireland yet,"
4564,MORAL.,The ‘old hand’ isn’t ‘done’;
4565,MORAL.,With masses against classes set
4566,MORAL.,There’s sure to be some fun.
4567,MORAL.,He’ll hold his own in spite of groan
4568,MORAL.,"And jest and jeer and snub,"
4569,MORAL.,"And that is why, with spirits high,"
4570,MORAL.,He warbles in his tub.”
4571,MORAL.,
4572,MORAL.,
4573,MORAL.,MORAL.
4574,MORAL.,
4575,MORAL.,"O Erin, yet shall burst for thee"
4576,MORAL.,The sunshine through the gloom--
4577,MORAL.,Take heart from all this melody
4578,MORAL.,In Gladstone’s dressing-room;
4579,MORAL.,"Plank down your dollars, Yankee boys,"
4580,MORAL.,"And tell each doubting “sub,”"
4581,MORAL.,"No fear the Grand One’s faith alloys,"
4582,MORAL.,“He warbles in his tub.”

4588,MORAL.,
4589,MORAL.,
4590,MORAL.,"I’m going to sing you a simple song,"
4591,MORAL.,To show that a king can do no wrong;
4592,MORAL.,A lay that is laden in every line
4593,MORAL.,With the grand old creed of “the right divine.”
4594,MORAL.,
4595,MORAL.,The merriest monarch of modern times
4596,MORAL.,Is the romping rex of these rambling rhymes:
4597,MORAL.,"The beamishest boy of the bold, bad batch,"
4598,MORAL.,The crack-crowned Kaiser of Colney Hatch.
4599,MORAL.,
4600,MORAL.,For many a year he played his pranks--
4601,MORAL.,He borrowed the balance of all the banks
4602,MORAL.,"To build him a palace in every town,"
4603,MORAL.,And when they were up he pulled them down.
4604,MORAL.,
4605,MORAL.,"He sat on the throne, on days of state,"
4606,MORAL.,"With a coffee-pot jammed on his regal pate,"
4607,MORAL.,And he showed his Court he could kiss his toes
4608,MORAL.,While he balanced his sceptre upon his nose.
4609,MORAL.,
4610,MORAL.,"He danced a jig in the House of Peers,"
4611,MORAL.,And offered to toss the lot for beers;
4612,MORAL.,And whenever a Cabinet Council sat
4613,MORAL.,He would make dirt-pies in the Premier’s hat.
4614,MORAL.,
4615,MORAL.,When the neighbouring monarchs came to call
4616,MORAL.,He would butter the steps and the marble hall;
4617,MORAL.,And when his visitors broke their legs
4618,MORAL.,He’d sit and he’d pelt them with hard-boiled eggs.
4619,MORAL.,
4620,MORAL.,"He dressed his army in drawers and frocks,"
4621,MORAL.,And little pink shoes and short white socks;
4622,MORAL.,And whenever he had a grand review
4623,MORAL.,He rode on a donkey painted blue.
4624,MORAL.,
4625,MORAL.,"His coachman signed all the royal decrees,"
4626,MORAL.,And he joined his footman in nightly sprees;
4627,MORAL.,"He addressed his cook as “My dear old chap,”"
4628,MORAL.,And in church he sat in his housemaid’s lap.
4629,MORAL.,
4630,MORAL.,"And now that I’ve finished my simple song,"
4631,MORAL.,"If you say, “What whoppers!” you’ll just be wrong,"
4632,MORAL.,As this isn’t a Lunatic Laureate’s lay--
4633,MORAL.,For the king was the King of Bavar_ia_.
