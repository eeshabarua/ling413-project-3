86,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"This new Edition of the Works of David Gray, containing, it is"
87,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"believed, all the maturely finished poems of the author, is a double"
88,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,memorial. It commemorates “the thin-spun life” of a man of true
89,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"genius and rare promise, and the highly cultured judgment and tender"
90,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,sympathies of a critic who has passed away in the vigorous fulness of
91,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,his years.
92,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,
93,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"A specimen page of “The Luggie,” forwarded with an appreciative letter"
94,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"from a friend, reached the author on the day before his death. He"
95,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,received it as “good news”—the fragmentary realization of his ambitious
96,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"dreams—and, in the hope that his name might not be wholly forgotten,"
97,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,said he could now enter “without tears” into his rest.
98,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,
99,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"Within a week before his removal from amongst us, Mr. Glassford Bell"
100,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,was engaged in correcting the proofs of the present edition. He had
101,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,selected from a mass of MSS. and other material what new pieces he
102,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,thought worthy of insertion in this enlarged edition—he had rearranged
103,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"the whole and finally revised the greater part of the volume, which it"
104,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,was his intention to preface with a Memoir and Criticism. He looked
105,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,forward to accomplishing this labour of love in a period of retirement
106,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,from more active work which he had proposed to pass in Italy.
107,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,
108,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,It has been thought inadvisable to commit to other hands the
109,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,unexpectedly interrupted task. For a statement of the few and
110,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"simple vicissitudes of the Poet’s career, as well as a brief but"
111,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"discriminating estimate of his rank in our literature, the reader is"
112,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,referred to the speech—at the close of the volume—delivered by Mr.
113,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"Bell, nine years ago, on the inauguration of the Monument in the"
114,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,“Auld Aisle” Burying-ground. Of the movement which resulted in this
115,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"tribute to departed genius, the late Sheriff was one of the most active"
116,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,"promoters. Himself a poet, and a generous patron of all genuine art,"
117,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,the West of Scotland has known no “larger heart” or “kindlier hand.”
118,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,There is something suggestive in the fact that his last effort was to
119,_INTRODUCTORY NOTE._,throw another wreath on the early tomb of David Gray.

591,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Her pliant song, slow from the closing sky"
592,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","The sacred snow fell calm. Yet through the shower,"
593,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Hushing all nature into silence, clear"

601,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Its homeless notes, the bird seems to my heart"
602,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",The individual bird of comely grey
603,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",That sang her pliant strain through falling snow.
604,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",
605,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Now, when the crumbling glebe is by the wind"
606,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Unbound, and snows adown the mountains hoar"

608,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Enyoke the willing horses, and upturn"
609,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",With deep-pressed share the saponaceous loam.
610,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",From morn to even with progression slow
611,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","The ploughboy cuts his awkward parallels,"
612,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And soberly imbrowns the decent fields.
613,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",It was a hazy February day
614,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Ten years ago, when I, a boy of ten,"
615,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Beheld a country ploughing-match. The morn
616,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Lighted the east with a dim smoky flare
617,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Of leaden purple, as the rumbling wains"
618,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Each with a plough light-laden (while behind
619,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Trotted a horse sleek-comb’d and tail bedight
620,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",With many coloured ribbons) by our home
621,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Went downwards to the rich fat meadow-grounds
622,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Bounding the Luggie. Many a herd of beeves
623,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Dew-lapp’d had fattened there, and headlong oft"
624,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","O’er the hoof-clattering turf they wildly ran,"
625,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Lashing with swinging tail the thirsty flies.
626,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",But now the smooth expanse of level green
627,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Was quickly to be changed to sober brown;
628,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And twenty ploughs by twenty ploughmen held
629,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",To cut with shining share the living turf.
630,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Oh many a wintry hour, thro’ wind and rain,"
631,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","In valleys gloom’d, or by the bleak hill-side"
632,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Lonely, these twenty had themselves inured"
633,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And stubborn’d to perfection. Many a touch
634,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And word of honest kindness had been used
635,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",To the dear faithful horses _snooving_ on
636,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","In quiet patience, jutting noble chests."
637,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Now the big day, expected long, was come:"
638,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","And, with proud shoulders yoked, conscious they stood"
639,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Patient and unrefusing; while behind,"
640,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","All ready stripped, brown brawny arms displayed—"
641,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Arms sinewed by long labour—eager swains
642,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","O’er-leaning slight, with cautious wary hold"
643,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",The plough detain. At the commencing sign
644,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",A simultaneous noise discordant tears
645,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",The air thick-closing to a hazy damp.
646,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Sudden the horses move, and the clear yokes,"
647,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Well polished, clatter. With an artful bend"
648,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",The gleaming coulter takes the grass and cuts
649,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",The greenly tedded blades with nibbling noise
650,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Almost unheard. The smooth share follows fast;
651,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And from its shining slope the clayey glebe
652,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",In neat and neighbouring furrows sidelong falls.
653,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Thus till the dank, raw-cold, and unpurged day"
654,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Gathering its rheumy humours threatens rain;
655,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And the bleak night steals up the forlorn east.
656,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And when the careful verdict is preferr’d
657,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","By the wise judge (a gray-hair’d husbandman,"
658,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Himself in his fresh youth a ploughboy keen),"
659,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Some bosoms fire exultant. Others, slow"

661,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Heart-sad and weary; and the rumbling noise
662,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Of homeward-going carts for miles away
663,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Is heard, till night brings silence and repose."

667,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",For homeward journey my belovëd friend!
668,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","He the great prize, the guinea all of gold,"
669,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Gained thrice and grew a very famous man;
670,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Till Death, the churl accurs’d, him in his prime"
671,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Bore to the border-land of wonder. Then
672,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",I felt the blank in life when dies a friend.
673,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Inexplicable emptiness and want
674,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Unsatisfied! The unrepealable law
675,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Consumed the living while the dead decayed.
676,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","No more, no more thro’ glorious nights of May"
677,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","We wander, chasing pleasure as of old."
678,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",First night of May! and the soft-silvered moon
679,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Brightens her semicircle in the blue;
680,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And ’mid the tawny orange of the west
681,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Shines the full star that ushers in the even!
682,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",On the low meadows by the Luggie-side
683,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Gathers a semi-lucent mist, and creeps"
684,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","In busy silence, shrouding golden furze"

689,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Was with me; and we swore a sudden oath,"
690,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",To travel half-a-dozen miles and court
691,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Two sisters, whose sweet faces sunshine kissed"
692,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",To berry brown and country comeliness—
693,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Kiss-worthier than the love of Solomon.
694,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",So singing clearly with a merry heart
695,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Old songs—_It was upon a Lammas nicht_;
696,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","And that sweet thing by gentle Tannahill,"

702,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","The plover, wildly screaming; and from glens"
703,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Of moaning firs the pheasant’s piercing shriek
704,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Discordant sounded. Then, ’mong elder trees"
705,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Throwing antique fat shadows, soon we saw"
706,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","The window panes, moon-whitened; and low heard"
707,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Bawtie, the shaggie collie, grumble out"
708,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",His disapproval in a sullen growl.
709,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","But slyly wearing nearer, cried my friend,"
710,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","“Whisht, Bawtie! Bawtie!” and the fellow came"
711,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Whining, and laid a wet nose in his palm"
712,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Obedient, while I tinkled on the panes"
713,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",A fairy summons to the souls within.
714,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","The door creaked musically, and a face"
715,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Peeped smiling, till I whispered, “Open, Kate!”"
716,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And thro’ the moonshine came the low sweet quest—
717,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",“Oh! is it you?” My answer was a kiss.
718,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Then entering the kitchen paved with stone,"
719,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",We kicked the sparkling faggot till it blazed;
720,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","And sitting round it, many a tale of love"
721,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Was told, until the chrysolite of dawn"
722,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Burned in the east, and from the mountain rolled"
723,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",The sarcenet mists far-flaming with the morn.
724,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",This was my first of May three years ago:
725,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",Now in a churchyard by the Bothlin side—

729,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","We sat at school together on one seat,"
730,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","Came home together thro’ the lanes, and knew"
731,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","The dunnock’s nest together in the hedge,"
732,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",With smooth blue eggs in cosy brightness warm.

735,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","For mutual heat, so when a trouble came"
736,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","We crept to one another, growing still"

738,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203","But suddenly death changed his countenance,"
739,"GRAY’S MONUMENT,                   203",And grav’d him in the darkness far from me.

2027,WORDSWORTH.,"Is heard to chaunt its masses o’er the sun,"
2028,WORDSWORTH.,"Already shrouded with his blood-stained robes,"
2029,WORDSWORTH.,Some mindful ones will drop a ready tear

2032,WORDSWORTH.,_I_ shall not feel their footsteps over _me_;
2033,WORDSWORTH.,_I_ shall not hear their long-known voices speak;
2034,WORDSWORTH.,For I’ll be dead. Oh! dead! and yet why weep?
2035,WORDSWORTH.,Oh! earthly hearts are weak to think of death!
2036,WORDSWORTH.,And ’tis a cutting thought to see our hopes
2037,WORDSWORTH.,"All shivered like a bunch of autumn leaves,"
2038,WORDSWORTH.,"And sunset games, and love—delightful love—"
2039,WORDSWORTH.,All buried in a grave. Yet it _must_ come.
2040,WORDSWORTH.,
2041,WORDSWORTH.,The wreck of centuries is buried here;
2042,WORDSWORTH.,The very monuments are hoar with age;
2043,WORDSWORTH.,The empty tower that sentinels them all
2044,WORDSWORTH.,"Wails when the gusts wild wander o’er the earth,"
2045,WORDSWORTH.,And creaks the rusty gate with careless Time.
2046,WORDSWORTH.,Methinks I see the silent funeral

2048,WORDSWORTH.,"Backward swings sullen the disusëd gate,"
2049,WORDSWORTH.,"And quiet, with measured steps, they enter here,"
2050,WORDSWORTH.,"And cross the moundy sward, amongst the stones,"
2051,WORDSWORTH.,To where the red clay gapes. How mournfully
2052,WORDSWORTH.,Are the last rites paid to a fleshly frame!
2053,WORDSWORTH.,Behold the old man with the sunken eyes
2054,WORDSWORTH.,And broken heart. This was his eldest-born.
2055,WORDSWORTH.,"A black-eyed boy he was, and in his youth"
2056,WORDSWORTH.,He was his joy and hope. And oft he gazed
2057,WORDSWORTH.,"Into his laughing face, and dreamed of times"
2058,WORDSWORTH.,"When in _his_ youthful strength he would _him_ shield,"
2059,WORDSWORTH.,And help him to the stone before the door
2060,WORDSWORTH.,"In summer time, when streamlets murmured clear."
2061,WORDSWORTH.,"So he grew up, but scorned the homely ways"
2062,WORDSWORTH.,Of the grey place of his nativity.
2063,WORDSWORTH.,"He saw the sun rise from behind the hills,"
2064,WORDSWORTH.,His well-thumbed book firm clasped in his young hand.
2065,WORDSWORTH.,"He saw it sink within the breezy glen,"
2066,WORDSWORTH.,And all the birds shrink from its burning face
2067,WORDSWORTH.,"To shade in nests, his book firm clasped in hand."
2068,WORDSWORTH.,But most he pondered over nature’s book—
2069,WORDSWORTH.,"The bubbled rill and the green-bladed corn,"
2070,WORDSWORTH.,The lowly wild-flowers and the leafy trees
2071,WORDSWORTH.,"Alive with music. His father wondered strange,"
2072,WORDSWORTH.,"And prouder grew of his bold quiet son,"
2073,WORDSWORTH.,Who spoke without restraint or lowly eye
2074,WORDSWORTH.,Unto God’s minister. And he would tell
2075,WORDSWORTH.,"At other fire-sides of his wondrous ways,"
2076,WORDSWORTH.,The oft-trimmed lamp when others were indrawn;
2077,WORDSWORTH.,Nor did he check the working of the mind
2078,WORDSWORTH.,And wearing of the flesh. _He_ knew no harm.
2079,WORDSWORTH.,"So time grew older still, and he went off,"
2080,WORDSWORTH.,"With paler face and heavier looks, to where"
2081,WORDSWORTH.,The sons of learning prosecute their toils.
2082,WORDSWORTH.,
2083,WORDSWORTH.,But here he pined like a transplanted flower
2084,WORDSWORTH.,"Borne from its native soil. No grass was here,"
2085,WORDSWORTH.,"Where he might lie, and watch the mighty clouds"
2086,WORDSWORTH.,"All floating in the blue. No lark was here,"
2087,WORDSWORTH.,"In love with angels, but the place was lone"
2088,WORDSWORTH.,"And dark and cold. No milkmaid’s song was here,"
2089,WORDSWORTH.,"Hushed when he passed upon the mountain side,"
2090,WORDSWORTH.,And anxious eye that gazed till he was gone.
2091,WORDSWORTH.,"And ’mid the throng of battling human kind,"
2092,WORDSWORTH.,"No simple eye nor horny hand sought his,"
2093,WORDSWORTH.,"Or voice, with homely accents, spoke relief."
2094,WORDSWORTH.,"All was unknown, unheeded, but his books,"
2095,WORDSWORTH.,"Which were his very self, his only friend."
2096,WORDSWORTH.,
2097,WORDSWORTH.,"And rich he was in lore, and strong in hope,"
2098,WORDSWORTH.,But heaven was panting for an inmate more:
2099,WORDSWORTH.,In heaven his place was vacant; as at home.
2100,WORDSWORTH.,"And time grew older still, and he came home"
2101,WORDSWORTH.,"To see his father, but he ne’er went back."
2102,WORDSWORTH.,"His body could not hold his restless soul,"
2103,WORDSWORTH.,"That longed, with eagle strength, to pierce the clouds,"
2104,WORDSWORTH.,"And so it burst this yielding bond on earth,"
2105,WORDSWORTH.,"Already, by a lengthened struggle, weak."
2106,WORDSWORTH.,His father saw him die. He never left
2107,WORDSWORTH.,"His bedside; but with eyes that seemed as glazed,"
2108,WORDSWORTH.,"For ever staring at the sharpened face,"
2109,WORDSWORTH.,He stood and stood and wept not. In that time
2110,WORDSWORTH.,His son saw heaven and chided all delay.
2111,WORDSWORTH.,His father knew not of the words of blame
2112,WORDSWORTH.,"That blest his dying breath. He seized the clay,"
2113,WORDSWORTH.,And clutched it desperately unto his breast.
2114,WORDSWORTH.,"The arms fell down, nor gave returning press."
2115,WORDSWORTH.,And that crush broke the doting father’s heart.
2116,WORDSWORTH.,This is the grave beside that white gravestone:
2117,WORDSWORTH.,Hold back the nettles while I read its lay:—
2118,WORDSWORTH.,
2119,WORDSWORTH.,
2120,WORDSWORTH.,Epitaph.
2121,WORDSWORTH.,
2122,WORDSWORTH.,_Beneath me lies the rotting faded mask_
2123,WORDSWORTH.,_Of a young mind that studied heaven well;_
2124,WORDSWORTH.,"_Ne’er in the sun of pleasure did he bask,_"
2125,WORDSWORTH.,_But loved hope’s shadow and fair virtue’s dell._
2126,WORDSWORTH.,"_He died while on the road to yonder sky,_"
2127,WORDSWORTH.,"_And every one that wanders careless here,_"
2128,WORDSWORTH.,"_Tread soft, and hark! Is not time hurrying by?_"
2129,WORDSWORTH.,_Begone and pray; the Day of Judgment’s near!_
2130,WORDSWORTH.,
2131,WORDSWORTH.,"I have seen children playing in this place,"
2132,WORDSWORTH.,"Have heard the voice of psalms sound plaintive here,"
2133,WORDSWORTH.,"And sighs commingle with these strains of love,"
2134,WORDSWORTH.,For memory is dewy with salt tears.
2135,WORDSWORTH.,
2136,WORDSWORTH.,Yet some lie here unknown to all. They came
2137,WORDSWORTH.,"Parentless, and they died and buried were"
2138,WORDSWORTH.,"By careless hands, that threw the wormy clods"
2139,WORDSWORTH.,All hastily upon the coffin lid
2140,WORDSWORTH.,"And then went home. Perhaps some empty chair,"
2141,WORDSWORTH.,"Like to a last year’s nest, still waits for them."
2142,WORDSWORTH.,Perhaps a nightly prayer still ascends
2143,WORDSWORTH.,"Among the breathings of a family home,"
2144,WORDSWORTH.,To hasten their return. Let us away
2145,WORDSWORTH.,And gather stones and place them at their heads.
2146,WORDSWORTH.,
2147,WORDSWORTH.,"Could all the tales that wait around the graves,"
2148,WORDSWORTH.,"Like volumes of wet sighs, be garnered up:"
2149,WORDSWORTH.,How hollow would each swelling heap resound.
2150,WORDSWORTH.,
2151,WORDSWORTH.,"Here one who died in mirth, and while the laugh,"
2152,WORDSWORTH.,"The merry laugh of joy did paint his face,"
2153,WORDSWORTH.,"Death frowned, and smote the smiling victim dead."
2154,WORDSWORTH.,
2155,WORDSWORTH.,Here one who wept to see the flushing sun
2156,WORDSWORTH.,"Glide reddening from his window bars, and set"
2157,WORDSWORTH.,"To rise again, and dry the silent dew"
2158,WORDSWORTH.,From his damp grave.
2159,WORDSWORTH.,
2160,WORDSWORTH.,"Here one who lingered long,"
2161,WORDSWORTH.,And every morn the fields missed knots of flowers
2162,WORDSWORTH.,Borne to his bedside. And his eyes grew wild
2163,WORDSWORTH.,"When the sun’s withering gaze stared in upon them,"
2164,WORDSWORTH.,"And he would press them to his fluttering heart,"
2165,WORDSWORTH.,"And face the mighty orb, defiant-like,"
2166,WORDSWORTH.,"As if to hurl it from the empty sky,"
2167,WORDSWORTH.,For daring thus to blight his darling flowers.
2168,WORDSWORTH.,"Poor fellow, he was mad."
2169,WORDSWORTH.,
2170,WORDSWORTH.,May God forbid
2171,WORDSWORTH.,"That clownish foot should crush the gentle clay,"
2172,WORDSWORTH.,"Or break the daisy stalks or primrose buds,"
2173,WORDSWORTH.,That bloom beside the low white marble stone
2174,WORDSWORTH.,In yon lone spot.
2175,WORDSWORTH.,
2176,WORDSWORTH.,
2177,WORDSWORTH.,To Jeanette.
2178,WORDSWORTH.,
2179,WORDSWORTH.,“I did hear you talk
2180,WORDSWORTH.,"Far above singing; after you were gone,"
2181,WORDSWORTH.,"I grew acquainted with my heart, and searched"
2182,WORDSWORTH.,What stirred it so! Alas! I found it love.”
2183,WORDSWORTH.,
2184,WORDSWORTH.,"I’ve sung of flowers in loving way,"
2185,WORDSWORTH.,"And pluck’d them too for half a day,"
2186,WORDSWORTH.,"And into posies wrought them, till"
2187,WORDSWORTH.,Orion glared above the hill:
2188,WORDSWORTH.,"But never, never saw I one"
2189,WORDSWORTH.,"As fair as thee beneath the sun,"
2190,WORDSWORTH.,"And never, never shall I know"
2191,WORDSWORTH.,A lovelier where’er I go.
2192,WORDSWORTH.,"Yet ’tis not for thy beauty, dear"
2193,WORDSWORTH.,"Jeanette, nor yet the sunny cheer"
2194,WORDSWORTH.,"About thy face, I love thee so!"
2195,WORDSWORTH.,But something of thy soul doth flow
2196,WORDSWORTH.,"Into my heart, and I am wild"
2197,WORDSWORTH.,With tender passion as a child.
2198,WORDSWORTH.,
2199,WORDSWORTH.,"I write thy name, and kiss it, dear"
2200,WORDSWORTH.,"Jeanette, in most impulsive fear!"
2201,WORDSWORTH.,"I whisper it into my heart,"
2202,WORDSWORTH.,And then its music makes me start
2203,WORDSWORTH.,In sudden gladness. I am fain
2204,WORDSWORTH.,To let the echo die again!
2205,WORDSWORTH.,Thy image groweth out of air
2206,WORDSWORTH.,"Until, entranced, I pause and stare"
2207,WORDSWORTH.,Into thy dear ideal eyes—
2208,WORDSWORTH.,The shadow of God’s paradise.
2209,WORDSWORTH.,
2210,WORDSWORTH.,"I am in love with thee, thou dear"
2211,WORDSWORTH.,"Jeanette, and keep my spirit clear"
2212,WORDSWORTH.,For thy embrace. It cannot be
2213,WORDSWORTH.,That thou wilt keep aloof from me
2214,WORDSWORTH.,Like that immortal Florentine
2215,WORDSWORTH.,Whom Tasso lov’d. O I would pine
2216,WORDSWORTH.,Into a pale accusing dream
2217,WORDSWORTH.,"To haunt thy pillow, and would seem"
2218,WORDSWORTH.,"So fond and sad, thy heart would fret"
2219,WORDSWORTH.,"For its unkindness, good Jeanette!"
2220,WORDSWORTH.,
2221,WORDSWORTH.,O many a long glad summer day
2222,WORDSWORTH.,"I laughed at love, and deemed his sway"
2223,WORDSWORTH.,"The tinkle of an idle tongue,"
2224,WORDSWORTH.,A fancy only to be sung.
2225,WORDSWORTH.,But thou all-beautiful! hast more
2226,WORDSWORTH.,"Of this, the thrilling passion—love—"
2227,WORDSWORTH.,"In one soft tress of plaited gold,"
2228,WORDSWORTH.,Than blessed Petrarch could unfold.
2229,WORDSWORTH.,"I love thee, dear Jeanette! I love"
2230,WORDSWORTH.,"Thee, O how dearly! Far above"
2231,WORDSWORTH.,"All singing is my love for thee,"
2232,WORDSWORTH.,Thou paradise of ecstasy!
2233,WORDSWORTH.,Make me immortal with a kiss
2234,WORDSWORTH.,"Of earnest pressure, and all bliss"
2235,WORDSWORTH.,"Is mine for ever, ever! Dear"
2236,WORDSWORTH.,"Jeanette, beloved, adored in fear!"
2237,WORDSWORTH.,
2238,WORDSWORTH.,
2239,WORDSWORTH.,The Poet and his Friend.
2240,WORDSWORTH.,
2241,WORDSWORTH.,I spent a day—the landmark of a life—
2242,WORDSWORTH.,"With one, a hero in the realms of rhyme:"
2243,WORDSWORTH.,"Ardent, yet calm—in human wisdoms rife,"
2244,WORDSWORTH.,And burning to be something in his time.
2245,WORDSWORTH.,"Through autumn foliage by a river side,"
2246,WORDSWORTH.,"Through glen of ivied trees and hazel dell,"
2247,WORDSWORTH.,"Each heart by its own sunshine glorified,"
2248,WORDSWORTH.,"We wandered wildly wise; till it befel,"
2249,WORDSWORTH.,"Beneath a faded elm, we came upon a well."
2250,WORDSWORTH.,
2251,WORDSWORTH.,"And, sitting by the still translucent water,"
2252,WORDSWORTH.,In pleasaunce sweet we quaffed the liquid cold;
2253,WORDSWORTH.,"Lo! as we drank, there passed a fairer daughter"
2254,WORDSWORTH.,Of Beauty than Fidessa. Then the old—
2255,WORDSWORTH.,"Yet never old, immortal song of glory,"
2256,WORDSWORTH.,"Breathing of summer bower and emerald lea,"
2257,WORDSWORTH.,And fountain bubbling coldly—Spenser’s story
2258,WORDSWORTH.,Thrilled all our brains to living ecstasy:
2259,WORDSWORTH.,Such power had maiden floating onward maidenly.
2260,WORDSWORTH.,
2261,WORDSWORTH.,"And pondered we, above that placid wave,"
2262,WORDSWORTH.,How we were thrown upon a colder day;
2263,WORDSWORTH.,"Yet, by the sword of Arthur! quite as brave,"
2264,WORDSWORTH.,As wondrous willing for the haughty fray
2265,WORDSWORTH.,As Arthegal and Guyon. So we rose
2266,WORDSWORTH.,"And joined our hands in fervent heat, and swore"
2267,WORDSWORTH.,"By old Renown’s endeavours, and by those"
2268,WORDSWORTH.,"Who battled well and won, to dream no more,"
2269,WORDSWORTH.,But through a sea of fears to struggle for the shore.
2270,WORDSWORTH.,
2271,WORDSWORTH.,"I think no good of him who takes his ease,"
2272,WORDSWORTH.,As pigeon-livered in the human game
2273,WORDSWORTH.,As Braggadocio: on the tranquil seas
2274,WORDSWORTH.,All ships sail nobly; but whoe’er is tame
2275,WORDSWORTH.,"To face the waves when fringed with windy spray,"
2276,WORDSWORTH.,"Is but a coward. Let him live, then rot!"
2277,WORDSWORTH.,"No man shall speak of him, no pilgrim lay"
2278,WORDSWORTH.,A twist of wild-flowers on the common spot
2279,WORDSWORTH.,That marks his meagre dust—the poltroon is forgot.
2280,WORDSWORTH.,
2281,WORDSWORTH.,"But, good friend! we shall fight. Even he who fails"
2282,WORDSWORTH.,In a great cause is noble. Time will show
2283,WORDSWORTH.,The best and worst of it; and while it hails
2284,WORDSWORTH.,"Some worthy Song-kings of the long-ago,"
2285,WORDSWORTH.,"Perhaps our names will echo with the rest,"
2286,WORDSWORTH.,"And in no feebleness. Meantime, oh fight!"
2287,WORDSWORTH.,"In the thick hurry of the battle press’d,"
2288,WORDSWORTH.,"Clothed on with resolution, the soul’s might—"
2289,WORDSWORTH.,Be Hector or Achilles!—God defend the right!
2290,WORDSWORTH.,
2291,WORDSWORTH.,
2292,WORDSWORTH.,The Two Streams.
2293,WORDSWORTH.,
2294,WORDSWORTH.,O cool the summer woods
2295,WORDSWORTH.,"Of dear Gartshore, where bloom"
2296,WORDSWORTH.,Soft clouds of white anemones
2297,WORDSWORTH.,Among their own perfume.
2298,WORDSWORTH.,"And clear the little brooklet,"
2299,WORDSWORTH.,"Singing an endless lay,"
2300,WORDSWORTH.,Winding its nameless waters
2301,WORDSWORTH.,Close by the white highway.
2302,WORDSWORTH.,"And here in sweet sensation,"
2303,WORDSWORTH.,"And soul-uneasy swoon,"
2304,WORDSWORTH.,I’ve lain for many a golden
2305,WORDSWORTH.,Hour of a summer noon.
2306,WORDSWORTH.,The cushats _crooned_ around me
2307,WORDSWORTH.,Their murmuring amorous song;
2308,WORDSWORTH.,"And in a brooding drowsiness,"
2309,WORDSWORTH.,The echoes swooned along;
2310,WORDSWORTH.,Till all the sweet sensations
2311,WORDSWORTH.,"Grew into utter pain,"
2312,WORDSWORTH.,And I was fain to wander
2313,WORDSWORTH.,All sadly home again.
2314,WORDSWORTH.,"There have been brotherhoods in song,"
2315,WORDSWORTH.,And human friendships true;
2316,WORDSWORTH.,"There have been lovers unto death,"
2317,WORDSWORTH.,"Yes, and right many too."
2318,WORDSWORTH.,"But never in the march of time,"
2319,WORDSWORTH.,"And ne’er in mortal knowing,"
2320,WORDSWORTH.,"From history or nobler rhyme,"
2321,WORDSWORTH.,Hath there been such constant flowing:
2322,WORDSWORTH.,"One from mountains far away,"
2323,WORDSWORTH.,"One from glades of emerald shining,"
2324,WORDSWORTH.,"Flowing, flowing evermore"
2325,WORDSWORTH.,For a delicate combining.
2326,WORDSWORTH.,"If upon a summer’s day,"
2327,WORDSWORTH.,"When the air is blue and bracing,"
2328,WORDSWORTH.,"You for Merkland take your way,"
2329,WORDSWORTH.,Sweet uneasy fancies chasing;
2330,WORDSWORTH.,You may see the famous grove—
2331,WORDSWORTH.,"If not famous, then most surely"
2332,WORDSWORTH.,"Ripe for fame, which is but love—"
2333,WORDSWORTH.,Where they mingle most demurely.
2334,WORDSWORTH.,Not in song and babbling play
2335,WORDSWORTH.,Which no poet could unravel;
2336,WORDSWORTH.,"But in tender simple way,"
2337,WORDSWORTH.,On a bed of golden gravel.
2338,WORDSWORTH.,"Where I sit I see them now,—"
2339,WORDSWORTH.,Bothlin with her endless winding
2340,WORDSWORTH.,"From a mountain’s purple brow,"
2341,WORDSWORTH.,Sacred contemplation finding;
2342,WORDSWORTH.,"In still nooks of shady rest,"
2343,WORDSWORTH.,Gleaming greenly ’neath the holly:
2344,WORDSWORTH.,"Youth, she says, is often blest"
2345,WORDSWORTH.,With a touch of melancholy.
2346,WORDSWORTH.,Luggie from the orient fields
2347,WORDSWORTH.,"Wiser is, yet hath a beauty,"
2348,WORDSWORTH.,Which the snowy conscience yields
2349,WORDSWORTH.,To the softened face of duty.
2350,WORDSWORTH.,"All she does bespeaks a grace,"
2351,WORDSWORTH.,Yet the grace hath that of sadness
2352,WORDSWORTH.,"We behold in many a face,"
2353,WORDSWORTH.,Where we had expected gladness.
2354,WORDSWORTH.,"But when Bothlin meets her there,"
2355,WORDSWORTH.,See the change to sudden glory!
2356,WORDSWORTH.,Surely such another pair
2357,WORDSWORTH.,Never met in classic story.
2358,WORDSWORTH.,"I could sing for half a day,"
2359,WORDSWORTH.,And my spirit never weary
2360,WORDSWORTH.,Fashioning the vernal lay
2361,WORDSWORTH.,With a linnet’s impulse cheery.
2362,WORDSWORTH.,"But some night in leafy June,"
2363,WORDSWORTH.,You the place yourself may see;
2364,WORDSWORTH.,"When the light is in the moon,"
2365,WORDSWORTH.,Like the passion that’s in me.
2366,WORDSWORTH.,
2367,WORDSWORTH.,
2368,WORDSWORTH.,Evening.
2369,WORDSWORTH.,
2370,WORDSWORTH.,"The evening now is still and calm,"
2371,WORDSWORTH.,As if sad Eloïsa’s soul
2372,WORDSWORTH.,Had breathed a spiritual balm
2373,WORDSWORTH.,Throughout the softened whole.
2374,WORDSWORTH.,Within the azure of the sky
2375,WORDSWORTH.,There shineth not a single star;
2376,WORDSWORTH.,But in a soft serenity
2377,WORDSWORTH.,The Crescent cometh from afar.
2378,WORDSWORTH.,In darker lines the firs that shade
2379,WORDSWORTH.,"The house of Merkland round and round,"
2380,WORDSWORTH.,"Come out, and from the fragrant glade"
2381,WORDSWORTH.,No liquid notes resound:
2382,WORDSWORTH.,"I heard the birds this live-long day,"
2383,WORDSWORTH.,"In sweet unwrinkled blending,"
2384,WORDSWORTH.,As if this merry month of May
2385,WORDSWORTH.,Should never have an ending.
2386,WORDSWORTH.,"O could I utter thoughts that rise,"
2387,WORDSWORTH.,O could I sing the tender
2388,WORDSWORTH.,"Softness of the summer skies,"
2389,WORDSWORTH.,In all their virgin splendour!
2390,WORDSWORTH.,"O crescent Moon, like pearlëd bark"
2391,WORDSWORTH.,To ferry souls to glory;
2392,WORDSWORTH.,O silent deepening of the dark
2393,WORDSWORTH.,O’er vale and promontory!
2394,WORDSWORTH.,"Alas, that I should live, and be"
2395,WORDSWORTH.,"A churl in soul, while slowly"
2396,WORDSWORTH.,"God makes the solemn eve, and breathes"
2397,WORDSWORTH.,A calm thro’ hearts unholy!
2398,WORDSWORTH.,
2399,WORDSWORTH.,
2400,WORDSWORTH.,The Love-Tryst.
2401,WORDSWORTH.,
2402,WORDSWORTH.,"Seven sycamores of wondrous fairness, smooth,"
2403,WORDSWORTH.,"And mealy green of trunk, and murmurous"
2404,WORDSWORTH.,"In multitudinous sun-twinkling leaves,"
2405,WORDSWORTH.,"This valley grace. Three fairer than the rest,"
2406,WORDSWORTH.,Which in the silent worship of my heart
2407,WORDSWORTH.,"I fondly call the brothers of Bridgend,"
2408,WORDSWORTH.,O’er cottage floors when doors are wide for heat
2409,WORDSWORTH.,"And often on the face of cradled child,"
2410,WORDSWORTH.,Throw dusky shadows. And when lenient winds
2411,WORDSWORTH.,"Blow motion, the cool shadows flicker, and play"
2412,WORDSWORTH.,"Upon the floors, and glimpse the countenance"
2413,WORDSWORTH.,"Of the sweet baby, till the mother laughs,"
2414,WORDSWORTH.,"And bending downward, kisses. But of all"
2415,WORDSWORTH.,"The trees that ever tufted hill or vale,"
2416,WORDSWORTH.,"That ever took the breeze or sheltered nest,"
2417,WORDSWORTH.,"Or rung with flowing melody of birds,"
2418,WORDSWORTH.,"The strangest and the dearest, best and first,"
2419,WORDSWORTH.,Waves audibly upon a windy hill
2420,WORDSWORTH.,"Above the Luggie. In the front of Spring,"
2421,WORDSWORTH.,"When the first crocus gleams among the grass,"
2422,WORDSWORTH.,"One half shines out full-leaved, the other bare:"
2423,WORDSWORTH.,And when the Autumn violet hath lost
2424,WORDSWORTH.,"Its fragrance, and the meadow-hay is mown,"
2425,WORDSWORTH.,"One half shines out full-leaved, the other bare."
2426,WORDSWORTH.,"There are two trees, whose marriageable boughs"
2427,WORDSWORTH.,"Twine, each with each, and throw a common shade,"
2428,WORDSWORTH.,A chestnut and an elm. The former opes
2429,WORDSWORTH.,Its oily buds whene’er the teeming south
2430,WORDSWORTH.,"Breathes life and warm intenerating balm,"
2431,WORDSWORTH.,But fades in early Autumn; while supreme
2432,WORDSWORTH.,"In vigorous development, the elm"
2433,WORDSWORTH.,Full-foliaged glimmers till October’s end.
2434,WORDSWORTH.,At the twin roots and facing the rich west
2435,WORDSWORTH.,"A summer seat is rustically carved,"
2436,WORDSWORTH.,A sylvan shelter from the mid-day sun:
2437,WORDSWORTH.,"But nor in mid-day, nor when decent eve"
2438,WORDSWORTH.,Gather her purples have I rested there;
2439,WORDSWORTH.,But when thro’ crisp and fleecy clouds the moon
2440,WORDSWORTH.,"O’er the soft orient sheds a milder dawn,"
2441,WORDSWORTH.,"Then tripping up the dewy lea, with step"
2442,WORDSWORTH.,"Light as an antelope, a maiden came,"
2443,WORDSWORTH.,And all her radiance in my bosom laid;
2444,WORDSWORTH.,"And on this seat, while high among the leaves"
2445,WORDSWORTH.,"Rain murmured, and the glory of the moon"
2446,WORDSWORTH.,"Was dimmed, I whispered all my passion-tale."
2447,WORDSWORTH.,"Ah me, ah me! her silken hair down-slid,"
2448,WORDSWORTH.,"Her smooth comb dropt among the grass, and both"
2449,WORDSWORTH.,"Stooped searching, and her burning cheek met mine:"
2450,WORDSWORTH.,"And starting suddenly upward, with her face"
2451,WORDSWORTH.,"Rosed to the beating temples, meek she gazed,"
2452,WORDSWORTH.,"Half sad, and the blue languish of her eyes"
2453,WORDSWORTH.,"Drooped tearful. And in madness and delight,"
2454,WORDSWORTH.,"I with my left arm zoned her little waist,"
2455,WORDSWORTH.,And with my right hand smoothed the silken hair
2456,WORDSWORTH.,"From her fair brow, snow-cold; and, by the doves"
2457,WORDSWORTH.,That bill and coo in Venus’ pearly car!
2458,WORDSWORTH.,There was a touch of lips. Then creeping close
2459,WORDSWORTH.,Into my bosom like a little thing
2460,WORDSWORTH.,"That was confused, she cradled pantingly."
2461,WORDSWORTH.,"Thus, while the rain was murmuring overhead,"
2462,WORDSWORTH.,And the out-passioned moon thro’ vaporous gloom
2463,WORDSWORTH.,"Dipt queenly, whispered I my perilous tale."
2464,WORDSWORTH.,"Ah me, ah me! a tender answer came;"
2465,WORDSWORTH.,For with her softling finger-tips she touched
2466,WORDSWORTH.,"My hand, warm laid upon her heart, and pressed"
2467,WORDSWORTH.,A meek approval with averted face.
2468,WORDSWORTH.,"O poet-maker, darling love, sweet love,"
2469,WORDSWORTH.,"Awakener of manhood, and the life"
2470,WORDSWORTH.,Of life. But let me not like talking fool
2471,WORDSWORTH.,"Prate all thy virgin whiteness, all thy sweet"
2472,WORDSWORTH.,"Deliciousness, for thou art living yet!"
2473,WORDSWORTH.,And as the rose that opens to the sun
2474,WORDSWORTH.,"Its downy leaves, scents sweetest at the core,"
2475,WORDSWORTH.,So all thy loveliness is but the robe
2476,WORDSWORTH.,That clothes a maiden chastity of soul.
2477,WORDSWORTH.,
2478,WORDSWORTH.,"O hasten, hasten down your azure road,"
2479,WORDSWORTH.,"And darken all the golden zones of heaven,"
2480,WORDSWORTH.,"Bright Sun, for I am weary for my love."
2481,WORDSWORTH.,
2482,WORDSWORTH.,
2483,WORDSWORTH.,An Epistle to a Friend.
2484,WORDSWORTH.,
2485,WORDSWORTH.,"Ah well-a-day, for human plans,"
2486,WORDSWORTH.,"And Fancy’s bright creations,"
2487,WORDSWORTH.,With all the purple-wingéd brood
2488,WORDSWORTH.,Of young imaginations!
2489,WORDSWORTH.,"I’ve tried, this weary winter’s day,"
2490,WORDSWORTH.,"All poignant cares to banish,"
2491,WORDSWORTH.,"By quaffing goblets, rosy-brimm’d,"
2492,WORDSWORTH.,Of dear poetic Rhenish.
2493,WORDSWORTH.,
2494,WORDSWORTH.,Not all the sweets of Castaly—
2495,WORDSWORTH.,"That river Heliconian,"
2496,WORDSWORTH.,"Adorn’d with swans of queenly snow,"
2497,WORDSWORTH.,Of ancient brood Strymonian;
2498,WORDSWORTH.,"Not all the maiden Muses nine,"
2499,WORDSWORTH.,"With tresses loosely flowing,"
2500,WORDSWORTH.,"Could magnetise a single line,"
2501,WORDSWORTH.,Or set my quill a-going;
2502,WORDSWORTH.,
2503,WORDSWORTH.,"Until I thought of thee, dear friend—"
2504,WORDSWORTH.,"Best loved, though long unheeded;"
2505,WORDSWORTH.,"Then forth the virgin pages came,"
2506,WORDSWORTH.,And quick my fingers speeded.
2507,WORDSWORTH.,"This very hour I’ll make amends,"
2508,WORDSWORTH.,"This lonely hour quiescent,"
2509,WORDSWORTH.,"When all the stars are in the blue,"
2510,WORDSWORTH.,’Mid lustre irridescent.
2511,WORDSWORTH.,
2512,WORDSWORTH.,"And, from the slopes I know right well,"
2513,WORDSWORTH.,"All shagg’d with bending thistle,"
2514,WORDSWORTH.,"The homeless wind comes with a swell,"
2515,WORDSWORTH.,And enters with a whistle;
2516,WORDSWORTH.,"Till brightlier glows the cosy fire,"
2517,WORDSWORTH.,"And cheerier my bosom,"
2518,WORDSWORTH.,"In thinking on the shivering woods,"
2519,WORDSWORTH.,And vales without a blossom.
2520,WORDSWORTH.,
2521,WORDSWORTH.,"You know the Luggie, natal stream!—"
2522,WORDSWORTH.,On earth to us none dearer—
2523,WORDSWORTH.,"Where Lady Luna, mirror’d, burns,"
2524,WORDSWORTH.,With all her handmaids near her.
2525,WORDSWORTH.,The time may come when haughty Fame
2526,WORDSWORTH.,With laurel shall console us;
2527,WORDSWORTH.,Then we shall halo it with song
2528,WORDSWORTH.,Till it outflow Pactolus!
2529,WORDSWORTH.,
2530,WORDSWORTH.,"The woods, the vales, the hawthorn dales,"
2531,WORDSWORTH.,The hoary hamlet Caurnie
2532,WORDSWORTH.,Shall be of goodlier report
2533,WORDSWORTH.,Than genius-hallowed Ferney.
2534,WORDSWORTH.,"And though I speak like boaster vain,"
2535,WORDSWORTH.,I speak not without thinking;
2536,WORDSWORTH.,Already on thy noble brow
2537,WORDSWORTH.,I see a chaplet twinkling!
2538,WORDSWORTH.,
2539,WORDSWORTH.,Heaven knows! amid the march of Time
2540,WORDSWORTH.,I am a simple dreamer;
2541,WORDSWORTH.,Can see more in the patient moon—
2542,WORDSWORTH.,Yon radiant crescent-gleamer—
2543,WORDSWORTH.,"Than all the banner’d pomp of war,"
2544,WORDSWORTH.,Or progress politician;
2545,WORDSWORTH.,"Than all the mockeries of rank,"
2546,WORDSWORTH.,And haughtiness patrician.
2547,WORDSWORTH.,
2548,WORDSWORTH.,"No golden key, however bright,"
2549,WORDSWORTH.,Can pass the fragrant portal
2550,WORDSWORTH.,"Of Fame’s grand temple-dome, or make"
2551,WORDSWORTH.,A simpleton immortal.
2552,WORDSWORTH.,Then what is wealth to our desire?
2553,WORDSWORTH.,(A burning tear-drop pays us)
2554,WORDSWORTH.,"A rushlight to the morning star,"
2555,WORDSWORTH.,To Homer but a Crœsus.
2556,WORDSWORTH.,
2557,WORDSWORTH.,"Then, Willie, though a careless dog,"
2558,WORDSWORTH.,"In brotherhood excuse me,"
2559,WORDSWORTH.,"Nor with neglect, and haughty look,"
2560,WORDSWORTH.,Most wantonly abuse me.
2561,WORDSWORTH.,"I’ve suffer’d much and suffer’d long,"
2562,WORDSWORTH.,Dear heart! since last we ponder’d
2563,WORDSWORTH.,"On gentle love, within that hall"
2564,WORDSWORTH.,Where ancient ivies wander’d.
2565,WORDSWORTH.,
2566,WORDSWORTH.,Nor think my love one jot the less—
2567,WORDSWORTH.,Than love I sought in passion—
2568,WORDSWORTH.,Because I thus have treated thee
2569,WORDSWORTH.,In unpoetic fashion.
2570,WORDSWORTH.,Let this suffice for evermore:
2571,WORDSWORTH.,"I plead a self-conviction,"
2572,WORDSWORTH.,And thy frank spirit never shall
2573,WORDSWORTH.,Increase my sad affliction.
2574,WORDSWORTH.,
2575,WORDSWORTH.,"Then sure I’ll see thee yet again,"
2576,WORDSWORTH.,Before another morrow
2577,WORDSWORTH.,"Steals up the east—shall see thee, friend!"
2578,WORDSWORTH.,In a delightful sorrow.
2579,WORDSWORTH.,"With silent gratitude, I speak"
2580,WORDSWORTH.,"A blessing on our meeting,"
2581,WORDSWORTH.,And may the light of friendship touch
2582,WORDSWORTH.,Our spirits at the greeting!
2583,WORDSWORTH.,
2584,WORDSWORTH.,
2585,WORDSWORTH.,A Vision of Venice.
2586,WORDSWORTH.,
2587,WORDSWORTH.,Behold! a waking vision crowns my soul
2588,WORDSWORTH.,"With beatific radiance, and the light"
2589,WORDSWORTH.,Of shining hope;—a golden-memoried dream
2590,WORDSWORTH.,"That clings unto my youth, as clung the strange"
2591,WORDSWORTH.,"Leonine phantom to that mystic man,"
2592,WORDSWORTH.,Lean Paracelsus. It has grown with me
2593,WORDSWORTH.,"Like destiny, or that which seems to be"
2594,WORDSWORTH.,"My destiny, ambition: and its glow"
2595,WORDSWORTH.,"Inflames my fancy, as if some clear star"
2596,WORDSWORTH.,Had burst in silvery light within my brain.
2597,WORDSWORTH.,From the smooth hyaline of that far sea
2598,WORDSWORTH.,"The pictured Adriatic rises, fair"
2599,WORDSWORTH.,"As dream, a kingly-built and tower’d town;"
2600,WORDSWORTH.,Column and arch and architrave instinct
2601,WORDSWORTH.,With delicatest beauty; overwrought
2602,WORDSWORTH.,With tracery of interlacèd leaves
2603,WORDSWORTH.,"For ever blooming on white marble, hush’d"
2604,WORDSWORTH.,"In everlasting summer, windless, cold:"
2605,WORDSWORTH.,The city of the Doges!
2606,WORDSWORTH.,
2607,WORDSWORTH.,From the calm
2608,WORDSWORTH.,Transparent waters float some thrilling sounds
2609,WORDSWORTH.,"Of Amphionic music, and the words"
2610,WORDSWORTH.,"Are Tasso’s, where he passions for his love,"
2611,WORDSWORTH.,"That lady Florentine so lily-smooth,"
2612,WORDSWORTH.,Clothed on with haughtiness!
2613,WORDSWORTH.,
2614,WORDSWORTH.,At the black stair
2615,WORDSWORTH.,"Of palace rising shadowy from the wave,"
2616,WORDSWORTH.,Two singing gondolieri wait a freight
2617,WORDSWORTH.,"Of loveliness. A tremulous woman, robed"
2618,WORDSWORTH.,"In dazzling satin, and whose dimpled arms,"
2619,WORDSWORTH.,And milky heaving breasts of living snow
2620,WORDSWORTH.,"Shine through their veil diaphanous, floats down"
2621,WORDSWORTH.,From the wide portal; and the ivory prow
2622,WORDSWORTH.,Of the soft-cushion’d gondola (as she
2623,WORDSWORTH.,Steps lightly from the marble to her place)
2624,WORDSWORTH.,"Dips, rises, dips again; then through the blue"
2625,WORDSWORTH.,Swift glides into the sunset.
2626,WORDSWORTH.,
2627,WORDSWORTH.,"Oh, the glow"
2628,WORDSWORTH.,Of that rich sunset dims whate’er I see
2629,WORDSWORTH.,In this my own dear valley! O’er the hills—
2630,WORDSWORTH.,"Those craggy Euganean hills, whose peaks"
2631,WORDSWORTH.,Wedge the clear crystalline—a blazonry
2632,WORDSWORTH.,"Of clouds pavilion’d, folded, interwound"
2633,WORDSWORTH.,"Inextricably, load the breezeless west"
2634,WORDSWORTH.,With awe and glory. The effulgence gleams
2635,WORDSWORTH.,"Upon a vision’d Belmont, home of her"
2636,WORDSWORTH.,Who loved as Shakespeare’s women do; and gleams
2637,WORDSWORTH.,Upon those walls wherein Othello’s spear
2638,WORDSWORTH.,"Stabb’d clinging innocence; where that poor wife,"
2639,WORDSWORTH.,"The love-Cassandra Belvidera, gave"
2640,WORDSWORTH.,Her soul in martyrdom to love and woe.
2641,WORDSWORTH.,
2642,WORDSWORTH.,"And shall I never that far town behold,"
2643,WORDSWORTH.,"Crested with sparkling columns, fiery towers,"
2644,WORDSWORTH.,Praxitelean masonry?—behold
2645,WORDSWORTH.,"VENICE, the mart of nations, ere I die?"
2646,WORDSWORTH.,By Heaven! her common merchants princes were
2647,WORDSWORTH.,Unto the continents; her traffickers
2648,WORDSWORTH.,The honourable of the earth! She stood
2649,WORDSWORTH.,"A crownèd city, and the fawning sea"
2650,WORDSWORTH.,Licked her white feet; and the eternal sun
2651,WORDSWORTH.,Kissed with departing beam her brow of snow!
2652,WORDSWORTH.,
2653,WORDSWORTH.,*       *       *       *       *
2654,WORDSWORTH.,
2655,WORDSWORTH.,"Woe to this Venice, with her crown of pride!"
2656,WORDSWORTH.,"The Lady of the kingdoms, the perfection"
2657,WORDSWORTH.,"Of beauty, and the joy of the whole earth!"
2658,WORDSWORTH.,Through her pavilions shall the crannying winds
2659,WORDSWORTH.,"Whistle, and all her borders in the sea"
2660,WORDSWORTH.,"Crumble their Parian wonder. Woe to her,"
2661,WORDSWORTH.,Whose glorious beauty is a fading flower!
2662,WORDSWORTH.,"Her sober-suited nightingales, with notes"
2663,WORDSWORTH.,"Of smooth liquidity and softened stops,"
2664,WORDSWORTH.,Solace the brakes; and ’mid her ancient streets
2665,WORDSWORTH.,"Tawny, the gleaming and harmonious sea"
2666,WORDSWORTH.,Makes silvery melody of bygone days.
2667,WORDSWORTH.,O white Enchantment! Ocean-spouse of old!
2668,WORDSWORTH.,"When thy high battlements and bulging domes,"
2669,WORDSWORTH.,"By sunset purpled, trembled in the wave!"
2670,WORDSWORTH.,"Now o’er thy towers the Lord hath spread his hand,"
2671,WORDSWORTH.,And as a cottage shalt thou be removed;
2672,WORDSWORTH.,"Like Nineveh, or cloudy Babylon!"
2673,WORDSWORTH.,
2674,WORDSWORTH.,
2675,WORDSWORTH.,The Anemone.
2676,WORDSWORTH.,
2677,WORDSWORTH.,"I have wandered far to-day,"
2678,WORDSWORTH.,In a pleased unquiet way;
2679,WORDSWORTH.,"Over hill and songful hollow,"
2680,WORDSWORTH.,"Vernal byeways, fresh and fair,"
2681,WORDSWORTH.,Did I simple fancies follow;
2682,WORDSWORTH.,"Till upon a hill-side bare,"
2683,WORDSWORTH.,Suddenly I chanced to see
2684,WORDSWORTH.,A little white anemone.
2685,WORDSWORTH.,
2686,WORDSWORTH.,Beneath a clump of furze it grew;
2687,WORDSWORTH.,And never mortal eye did view
2688,WORDSWORTH.,"Its rathe and slender beauty, till"
2689,WORDSWORTH.,I saw it in no mocking mood;
2690,WORDSWORTH.,For with its sweetness did it fill
2691,WORDSWORTH.,To me the ample solitude.
2692,WORDSWORTH.,A fond remembrance made me see
2693,WORDSWORTH.,Strange light in the anemone.
2694,WORDSWORTH.,
2695,WORDSWORTH.,"One April day when I was seven,"
2696,WORDSWORTH.,"Beneath the clear and deepening heaven,"
2697,WORDSWORTH.,"My father, God preserve him! went"
2698,WORDSWORTH.,With me a Scottish mile and more;
2699,WORDSWORTH.,And in a playful merriment
2700,WORDSWORTH.,He deck’d my bonnet o’er and o’er—
2701,WORDSWORTH.,To fling a sunshine on his ease—
2702,WORDSWORTH.,With tenderest anemones.
2703,WORDSWORTH.,
2704,WORDSWORTH.,"Now, gentle reader, as I live,"
2705,WORDSWORTH.,This snowy little bloom did give
2706,WORDSWORTH.,My being most endearing throes.
2707,WORDSWORTH.,I saw my father in his prime;
2708,WORDSWORTH.,"But youth it comes, and youth it goes,"
2709,WORDSWORTH.,And he has spent his blithest time:
2710,WORDSWORTH.,"Yet dearer grown thro’ all to me,"
2711,WORDSWORTH.,And dearer the anemone.
2712,WORDSWORTH.,
2713,WORDSWORTH.,So with the spirit of a sage
2714,WORDSWORTH.,"I pluck’d it from its hermitage,"
2715,WORDSWORTH.,And placed it ’tween the sacred leaves
2716,WORDSWORTH.,Of _Agnes’ Eve_ at that rare part
2717,WORDSWORTH.,"Where she her fragrant robe unweaves,"
2718,WORDSWORTH.,"And with a gently beating heart,"
2719,WORDSWORTH.,"In troubled bliss and balmy woe,"
2720,WORDSWORTH.,Lies down to dream of Porphyro.
2721,WORDSWORTH.,
2722,WORDSWORTH.,"Let others sing of that and this,"
2723,WORDSWORTH.,In war and science find their bliss;
2724,WORDSWORTH.,Vainly they seek and will not find
2725,WORDSWORTH.,The subtle lore that nature brings
2726,WORDSWORTH.,"Unto the reverential mind,"
2727,WORDSWORTH.,"The pathos worn by common things,"
2728,WORDSWORTH.,"By every flower that lights the lea,"
2729,WORDSWORTH.,And by the pale anemone.
2730,WORDSWORTH.,
2731,WORDSWORTH.,
2732,WORDSWORTH.,The Yellowhammer.
2733,WORDSWORTH.,
2734,WORDSWORTH.,"In fairy glen of Woodilee,"
2735,WORDSWORTH.,"One sunny summer morning,"
2736,WORDSWORTH.,"I plucked a little birchen tree,"
2737,WORDSWORTH.,The spongy moss adorning;
2738,WORDSWORTH.,"And bearing it delighted home,"
2739,WORDSWORTH.,"I planted it in garden loam,"
2740,WORDSWORTH.,"Where, perfecting all duty,"
2741,WORDSWORTH.,It flowered in tassel’d beauty.
2742,WORDSWORTH.,
2743,WORDSWORTH.,When delicate April in each dell
2744,WORDSWORTH.,Was silently completing
2745,WORDSWORTH.,"Her ministry in bud and bell,"
2746,WORDSWORTH.,To grace the summer’s meeting;
2747,WORDSWORTH.,My birchen tree of glossy rind
2748,WORDSWORTH.,Determined not to be behind;
2749,WORDSWORTH.,So with a subtle power
2750,WORDSWORTH.,The buds began to flower.
2751,WORDSWORTH.,
2752,WORDSWORTH.,And I could watch from out my house
2753,WORDSWORTH.,The twigs with leaflets thicken;
2754,WORDSWORTH.,From glossy rind to twining boughs
2755,WORDSWORTH.,The milky sap ’gan quicken.
2756,WORDSWORTH.,And when the fragrant form was green
2757,WORDSWORTH.,"No fairer tree was to be seen,"
2758,WORDSWORTH.,"All Gartshore woods adorning,"
2759,WORDSWORTH.,Where doves are always mourning.
2760,WORDSWORTH.,
2761,WORDSWORTH.,"But never dove with liquid wing,"
2762,WORDSWORTH.,"Or neck of changeful gleaming,"
2763,WORDSWORTH.,Came near my garden tree to sing
2764,WORDSWORTH.,Or _croodle_ out its meaning.
2765,WORDSWORTH.,"But this sweet day, an hour ago,"
2766,WORDSWORTH.,"A yellowhammer clear and low,"
2767,WORDSWORTH.,In love and tender pity
2768,WORDSWORTH.,Thrilled out his dainty ditty.
2769,WORDSWORTH.,
2770,WORDSWORTH.,"And I was pleased, as you may think,"
2771,WORDSWORTH.,And blessed the little singer:
2772,WORDSWORTH.,"‘O fly for your mate to Luggie brink,"
2773,WORDSWORTH.,Dear little bird! and bring her;
2774,WORDSWORTH.,"And build your nest among the boughs,"
2775,WORDSWORTH.,A sweet and cosy little house
2776,WORDSWORTH.,"Where ye may well content ye,"
2777,WORDSWORTH.,Since true love is so plenty.
2778,WORDSWORTH.,
2779,WORDSWORTH.,"And when she sits upon her nest,"
2780,WORDSWORTH.,Here are cool shades to shroud her.’
2781,WORDSWORTH.,"At this the singer sang his best,"
2782,WORDSWORTH.,"O louder yet, and louder;"
2783,WORDSWORTH.,"Until I shouted in my glee,"
2784,WORDSWORTH.,His song had so enchanted me.
2785,WORDSWORTH.,No nightingale could pant on
2786,WORDSWORTH.,In joy so wise and wanton.
2787,WORDSWORTH.,
2788,WORDSWORTH.,"But at my careless noise he flew,"
2789,WORDSWORTH.,And if he chance to bring her
2790,WORDSWORTH.,A happy bride the summer thro’
2791,WORDSWORTH.,"’Mong birchen boughs to linger,"
2792,WORDSWORTH.,I’ll sing to you in numbers high
2793,WORDSWORTH.,"A summer song that shall not die,"
2794,WORDSWORTH.,But keep in memory clearly
2795,WORDSWORTH.,The bird I love so dearly.
2796,WORDSWORTH.,
2797,WORDSWORTH.,
2798,WORDSWORTH.,The Cuckoo.
2799,WORDSWORTH.,
2800,WORDSWORTH.,"Last night a vision was dispelled,"
2801,WORDSWORTH.,Which I can never dream again;
2802,WORDSWORTH.,"A wonder from the earth has gone,"
2803,WORDSWORTH.,A passion from my brain.
2804,WORDSWORTH.,I saw upon a budding ash
2805,WORDSWORTH.,"A cuckoo, and she blithely sung"
2806,WORDSWORTH.,"To all the valleys round about,"
2807,WORDSWORTH.,While on a branch she swung.
2808,WORDSWORTH.,"Cuckoo, cuckoo! I looked around,"
2809,WORDSWORTH.,"And like a dream fulfilled,"
2810,WORDSWORTH.,"A slender bird of modest brown,"
2811,WORDSWORTH.,My sight with wonder thrilled.
2812,WORDSWORTH.,I looked again and yet again;
2813,WORDSWORTH.,"My eyes, thought I, do sure deceive me,"
2814,WORDSWORTH.,"But when belief made doubting vain,"
2815,WORDSWORTH.,"Alas, the sight did grieve me."
2816,WORDSWORTH.,"For twice to-day I heard the cry,"
2817,WORDSWORTH.,The hollow cry of melting love;
2818,WORDSWORTH.,And twice a tear bedimmed my eye—
2819,WORDSWORTH.,"I _saw_ the singer in the grove,"
2820,WORDSWORTH.,"I saw him pipe his eager tone,"
2821,WORDSWORTH.,"Like any other common bird,"
2822,WORDSWORTH.,"And, as I live, the sovereign cry"
2823,WORDSWORTH.,Was not the one I always heard.
2824,WORDSWORTH.,
2825,WORDSWORTH.,O why within that lusty wood
2826,WORDSWORTH.,Did I the fairy sight behold?
2827,WORDSWORTH.,O why within that solitude
2828,WORDSWORTH.,Was I thus blindly overbold?
2829,WORDSWORTH.,"My heart, forgive me! for indeed"
2830,WORDSWORTH.,I cannot speak my thrilling pain:
2831,WORDSWORTH.,"The wonder vanished from the earth,"
2832,WORDSWORTH.,The passion from my brain.
2833,WORDSWORTH.,
2834,WORDSWORTH.,
2835,WORDSWORTH.,Fame.
2836,WORDSWORTH.,
2837,WORDSWORTH.,_A Fragment._
2838,WORDSWORTH.,
2839,WORDSWORTH.,"O Glorious Fame! next grandest word to God,"
2840,WORDSWORTH.,"Father of all things beautiful and grand,"
2841,WORDSWORTH.,Of all the thoughts ideal and sublime
2842,WORDSWORTH.,That grace the annals of our literature.
2843,WORDSWORTH.,Thou stirrer of the heart to noble deeds!
2844,WORDSWORTH.,Thou powerful antidote to cringing fear
2845,WORDSWORTH.,"Of battle, rolling ’mid the billowy smoke"
2846,WORDSWORTH.,That wreaths its curls blue over flood and field!
2847,WORDSWORTH.,"In the cold, creaking garret, or beside"
2848,WORDSWORTH.,"The entrance to a theatre, or where"
2849,WORDSWORTH.,"Luxury pillows soft the somnolent head,"
2850,WORDSWORTH.,Or where the dew-bent daisy droops to kiss
2851,WORDSWORTH.,"The dark grey eggs of lark, companion sweet!"
2852,WORDSWORTH.,"There thou dost lift their souls above this world,"
2853,WORDSWORTH.,"And teachest them in language fair and wild,"
2854,WORDSWORTH.,To ope their hearts in strains of poesy.
2855,WORDSWORTH.,"Ah, noble Fame! how deeply I adore"
2856,WORDSWORTH.,"Thy altar, smelling sweet with fond applause!"
2857,WORDSWORTH.,"Sages may shun, philosophers may scorn;"
2858,WORDSWORTH.,"But, ah! to a young heart, how glorious"
2859,WORDSWORTH.,"The thought that he, by well-earned merit, shall"
2860,WORDSWORTH.,"Be spoken of, yea praised, ’neath the roof-tree"
2861,WORDSWORTH.,"Of peasant, or beneath the monarch’s dome!"
2862,WORDSWORTH.,"That learned men will wonder, and in joy"
2863,WORDSWORTH.,Will lift their hands and shake astonished heads;
2864,WORDSWORTH.,"That by the fireside, while the flick’ring lamp"
2865,WORDSWORTH.,Doth send its shadow-forming light athwart.
2866,WORDSWORTH.,"The genius young shall read, and read, and read"
2867,WORDSWORTH.,"Until the warning bell strike one short hour,"
2868,WORDSWORTH.,"Then fling it past, and, pillowed on his couch,"
2869,WORDSWORTH.,Dream of the happy-gifted one that wrote it;
2870,WORDSWORTH.,"That maidens, high in rank and fair in form,"
2871,WORDSWORTH.,Shall speak to one another of that man
2872,WORDSWORTH.,"Who, bathing in the pure Castalian fount,"
2873,WORDSWORTH.,"Arose, and from his form with pearlets clad"
2874,WORDSWORTH.,"Shook off the diamonds in bright profusion,"
2875,WORDSWORTH.,"That, while the clouds do tell their pattering beads,"
2876,WORDSWORTH.,And through the forest roars the wailing wind
2877,WORDSWORTH.,"Sporting with the brown leaves that wheel aloft,"
2878,WORDSWORTH.,"A joyous family, seated by a fire"
2879,WORDSWORTH.,"That roars in laughter at the storm without,"
2880,WORDSWORTH.,Talked of the poet—
2881,WORDSWORTH.,
2882,WORDSWORTH.,
2883,WORDSWORTH.,Honeysuckle.
2884,WORDSWORTH.,
2885,WORDSWORTH.,"Stop! taste the balmy essence of this flower,"
2886,WORDSWORTH.,That fondly twines about the dark-green fir;
2887,WORDSWORTH.,"The air is sweet, and, like a mild-eyed saint,"
2888,WORDSWORTH.,It liveth doing good. The balmy gale
2889,WORDSWORTH.,Far wafts its odours to the lowly door
2890,WORDSWORTH.,"Of yon small cot thatched with the dying heath,"
2891,WORDSWORTH.,And the old dame doth bless the laden wind.
2892,WORDSWORTH.,I do not think that e’er a tender eye
2893,WORDSWORTH.,"Looked on thee but with love,—that e’er a tongue"
2894,WORDSWORTH.,Spoke of thee but with blessings and with praise.
2895,WORDSWORTH.,"Thy lean red shanks cling round the dusty trunk,"
2896,WORDSWORTH.,"And send their white shoots through the brown rough bark,"
2897,WORDSWORTH.,"So true, so fond and frail-like that when one"
2898,WORDSWORTH.,"Looks on thee, his mind’s eye sees round God’s throne"
2899,WORDSWORTH.,White spirits breathing hymns and fed with love.
2900,WORDSWORTH.,"Ye sweet, sweet flowers! ye must have mutual love,"
2901,WORDSWORTH.,"For when one stalk, with its own beauty, droops,"
2902,WORDSWORTH.,"With oily leaves and breathing blossoms heavy,"
2903,WORDSWORTH.,"The others haste their sister to upraise,"
2904,WORDSWORTH.,"And, winding round it with affection’s grasp,"
2905,WORDSWORTH.,Lift it from off the earth’s dark dreaded breast.
2906,WORDSWORTH.,How many nosegays have I often culled
2907,WORDSWORTH.,"Of thee, fair guiltless thief, for even thy name"
2908,WORDSWORTH.,"Tells how thou _sucklest_ nature’s _honeyed_ sweets,"
2909,WORDSWORTH.,And leav’st her less wherewith to bless the rest.
2910,WORDSWORTH.,"Thou art not _very_ beauteous; many flowers,"
2911,WORDSWORTH.,"With high-fringed crests and gaudy-spotted leaves,"
2912,WORDSWORTH.,Outstrip thy homely dress; but tell me one
2913,WORDSWORTH.,That blesseth ether with more fragrant smell?
2914,WORDSWORTH.,’Tis ever thus. Furred robes and shining silks
2915,WORDSWORTH.,Oft hide a poppy’s smell—a dastard mind;
2916,WORDSWORTH.,And homely garments oft adorn a breast
2917,WORDSWORTH.,"That heaves at pity’s tale and tale of wrong,"
2918,WORDSWORTH.,"And, known by none, yet is a friend to all."
2919,WORDSWORTH.,
2920,WORDSWORTH.,
2921,WORDSWORTH.,Where the Lilies used to Spring.
2922,WORDSWORTH.,
2923,WORDSWORTH.,"When the place was green with the shaky grass,"
2924,WORDSWORTH.,And the windy trees were high;
2925,WORDSWORTH.,"When the leaflets told each other tales,"
2926,WORDSWORTH.,And the stars were in the sky;
2927,WORDSWORTH.,When the silent crows hid their ebon beaks
2928,WORDSWORTH.,Beneath their ruffled wing—
2929,WORDSWORTH.,Then the fairies watered the glancing spot
2930,WORDSWORTH.,Where the lilies used to spring!
2931,WORDSWORTH.,
2932,WORDSWORTH.,"When the sun is high in the summer sky,"
2933,WORDSWORTH.,And the lake is deep with clouds;
2934,WORDSWORTH.,"When gadflies bite the prancing kine,"
2935,WORDSWORTH.,And light the lark enshrouds—
2936,WORDSWORTH.,"Then the butterfly, like a feather dropped"
2937,WORDSWORTH.,"From the tip of an angel’s wing,"
2938,WORDSWORTH.,Floats wavering on to the glancing spot
2939,WORDSWORTH.,Where the lilies used to spring!
2940,WORDSWORTH.,
2941,WORDSWORTH.,"When the wheat is shorn and the burns run brown,"
2942,WORDSWORTH.,And the moon shines clear at night;
2943,WORDSWORTH.,"When wains are heaped with rustling corn,"
2944,WORDSWORTH.,And the swallows take their flight;
2945,WORDSWORTH.,"When the trees begin to cast their leaves,"
2946,WORDSWORTH.,"And the birds, new-feathered, sing—"
2947,WORDSWORTH.,Then comes the bee to the glancing spot
2948,WORDSWORTH.,Where the lilies used to spring!
2949,WORDSWORTH.,
2950,WORDSWORTH.,"When the sky is grey and the trees are bare,"
2951,WORDSWORTH.,"And the grass is long and brown,"
2952,WORDSWORTH.,"And black moss clothes the soft damp thatch,"
2953,WORDSWORTH.,"And the rain comes weary down,"
2954,WORDSWORTH.,And countless droplets on the pond
2955,WORDSWORTH.,Their widening orbits ring—
2956,WORDSWORTH.,Then bleak and cold is the silent spot
2957,WORDSWORTH.,Where the lilies used to spring!
2958,WORDSWORTH.,
2959,WORDSWORTH.,
2960,WORDSWORTH.,Snow.
2961,WORDSWORTH.,
2962,WORDSWORTH.,"Flowers upon the summer lea,"
2963,WORDSWORTH.,"Daisies, kingcups, pale primroses—"
2964,WORDSWORTH.,"These are sung from sea to sea,"
2965,WORDSWORTH.,As many a darling rhyme discloses.
2966,WORDSWORTH.,Tangled wood and hawthorn dale
2967,WORDSWORTH.,In many a songful snatch prevail;
2968,WORDSWORTH.,"But never yet, as well I mind,"
2969,WORDSWORTH.,In all their verses can I find
2970,WORDSWORTH.,"A simple tune, with quiet flow,"
2971,WORDSWORTH.,To match the falling of the snow.
2972,WORDSWORTH.,
2973,WORDSWORTH.,"O weary passed each winter day,"
2974,WORDSWORTH.,And windily howled each winter night;
2975,WORDSWORTH.,"O miry grew each village way,"
2976,WORDSWORTH.,And mists enfolded every height;
2977,WORDSWORTH.,And ever on the window pane
2978,WORDSWORTH.,"A froward gust blew down with rain,"
2979,WORDSWORTH.,And day by day in tawny brown
2980,WORDSWORTH.,The Luggie stream came heaving down:—
2981,WORDSWORTH.,I could have fallen asleep and dreamed
2982,WORDSWORTH.,Until again spring sunshine gleamed.
2983,WORDSWORTH.,
2984,WORDSWORTH.,"And what! said I, is this the mode"
2985,WORDSWORTH.,That Winter kings it now-a-days?
2986,WORDSWORTH.,"The Robin keeps its own abode,"
2987,WORDSWORTH.,And pipes his independent lays.
2988,WORDSWORTH.,"I’ve seen the day on Merkland hill,"
2989,WORDSWORTH.,"That snow has fallen with a will,"
2990,WORDSWORTH.,"Even in November! Now, alas;"
2991,WORDSWORTH.,The whole year round we see the grass:—
2992,WORDSWORTH.,"Ah, winter now may come and go"
2993,WORDSWORTH.,Without a single fall of snow.
2994,WORDSWORTH.,
2995,WORDSWORTH.,It was the latest day but one
2996,WORDSWORTH.,"Of winter, as I questioned thus;"
2997,WORDSWORTH.,"And sooth! an angry mood was on,"
2998,WORDSWORTH.,As at a thing most scandalous;—
2999,WORDSWORTH.,When lo! some hailstones on the pane
3000,WORDSWORTH.,"With sudden tinkle rang amain,"
3001,WORDSWORTH.,Till in an ecstasy of joy
3002,WORDSWORTH.,I clapp’d and shouted like a boy—
3003,WORDSWORTH.,"Oh, rain may come and rain may go,"
3004,WORDSWORTH.,But what can match the falling snow!
3005,WORDSWORTH.,
3006,WORDSWORTH.,It draped the naked sycamore
3007,WORDSWORTH.,"On Foordcroft hill, above the well;"
3008,WORDSWORTH.,The elms of Rosebank o’er and o’er
3009,WORDSWORTH.,Were silvered richly as it fell.
3010,WORDSWORTH.,"The distant Campsie peaks were lost,"
3011,WORDSWORTH.,And farthest Criftin with his host
3012,WORDSWORTH.,"Of gloomy pine-trees disappeared,"
3013,WORDSWORTH.,Nor even a lonely ridge upreared.—
3014,WORDSWORTH.,"Oh, rain may come and rain may go,"
3015,WORDSWORTH.,But what can match the falling snow!
3016,WORDSWORTH.,
3017,WORDSWORTH.,"Afar upon the Solsgirth moor,"

3482,_DAVID GRAY._,At the inauguration of the Monument erected to the Poet’s Memory in the
3483,_DAVID GRAY._,"“Auld Aisle” Burying Ground, Kirkintilloch, July 29, 1865, Mr. Bell"
3484,_DAVID GRAY._,said:—
3485,_DAVID GRAY._,
3486,_DAVID GRAY._,"David Gray, was born on the 29th January, 1838, and reared in his"
3487,_DAVID GRAY._,father’s house here at Merkland till he reached his fourteenth year.
3488,_DAVID GRAY._,"His parents, seeing as they did his disposition and his genius, thought"
3489,_DAVID GRAY._,they might find means to bring up their son for the Church. With that
3490,_DAVID GRAY._,"view he was sent into Glasgow, and as he required funds to aid him"
3491,_DAVID GRAY._,"in the prosecution of his studies, at that very early age he became"
3492,_DAVID GRAY._,a pupil-teacher in the city. He contrived also to attend the famous
3493,_DAVID GRAY._,University there for four successive sessions. But during all that time
3494,_DAVID GRAY._,"his mind was brimming over with poetry, which rose like a rising tide"
3495,_DAVID GRAY._,"above his Latin, above his Greek, above his theological studies. He had"
3496,_DAVID GRAY._,a very ardent and ambitious fancy; he had high aspirations; he had an
3497,_DAVID GRAY._,"earnest belief that he was born to be a poet, and to attain fame. In"
3498,_DAVID GRAY._,one so young it might have been thought that this was an overweening
3499,_DAVID GRAY._,conception of his own powers. But in reality it was not. A poet is
3500,_DAVID GRAY._,"also a _vates_ or prophet, and there is no reason why he should not"
3501,_DAVID GRAY._,be permitted sometimes to prophesy of himself. David Gray prophesied
3502,_DAVID GRAY._,of himself that his name would yet be known to his fellow-countrymen
3503,_DAVID GRAY._,"as a poet and a teacher, for every true poet is a true teacher. In"
3504,_DAVID GRAY._,"May, 1860, when he had so far completed his studies in Glasgow, and"
3505,_DAVID GRAY._,"had arrived at the age of nearly 22, he started alone for London."
3506,_DAVID GRAY._,"He had read of the great literary world of the metropolis, and he"
3507,_DAVID GRAY._,"was fired with an ambition to mingle in it and to make himself, if"
3508,_DAVID GRAY._,"possible, known to some of the men there. He was fortunate in forming"
3509,_DAVID GRAY._,"the acquaintance, very soon after going to London, of Mr. Monckton"
3510,_DAVID GRAY._,"Milnes, now Lord Houghton, who at once formed a correct appreciation"
3511,_DAVID GRAY._,of the poet’s character and genius. Lord Houghton has himself put it
3512,_DAVID GRAY._,upon record that he found in David Gray what appeared to him to be the
3513,_DAVID GRAY._,making of a great man. He has also recorded of him that upon first
3514,_DAVID GRAY._,seeing him he was strongly reminded of the poet Shelley. Gray had a
3515,_DAVID GRAY._,"light, well-built form; he had a full brow and an out-looking eye;"
3516,_DAVID GRAY._,"and he had a sensitive, melancholy mouth. So Lord Houghton speaks of"
3517,_DAVID GRAY._,"him. He formed also in London other acquaintances of value, including"
3518,_DAVID GRAY._,"Mr. Oliphant, then Private Secretary to Lord Elgin, now member for the"
3519,_DAVID GRAY._,"Stirling Burghs. As to Sydney Dobell, the poet, I do not know that he"
3520,_DAVID GRAY._,actually formed the personal acquaintance of that gentleman; but he had
3521,_DAVID GRAY._,"frequent correspondence with Mr. Dobell, and received from him valuable"
3522,_DAVID GRAY._,"letters, and suggestions, and assistance. He formed the acquaintance"
3523,_DAVID GRAY._,of a very estimable woman—Miss Marian James—herself an authoress of
3524,_DAVID GRAY._,great reputation. Nearer at home he had already attained the friendly
3525,_DAVID GRAY._,companionship of some whom he valued much. I am delighted to see two of
3526,_DAVID GRAY._,"those gentlemen present to-night—Mr. W. Freeland, David Gray’s early"
3527,_DAVID GRAY._,"and attached friend, now of the _Herald_ Office, Glasgow, and Mr."
3528,_DAVID GRAY._,"James Hedderwick, himself a poet and an editor of great reputation. He"
3529,_DAVID GRAY._,"had not, however, been long in London till he was seized with a cold"
3530,_DAVID GRAY._,which rapidly assumed the character of consumption. Lord Houghton and
3531,_DAVID GRAY._,"others, feeling deeply interested in him, got him sent to the South of"
3532,_DAVID GRAY._,"England for a time; but the disease making rapid progress, David Gray"
3533,_DAVID GRAY._,"was seized with an irresistible home-sickness, and notwithstanding"
3534,_DAVID GRAY._,"all the kindness, and all the attention of his friends in the South,"
3535,_DAVID GRAY._,"in January, 1861, he made his re-appearance at his father’s house"
3536,_DAVID GRAY._,"down there in Merkland. He lived there from January, 1861, to the 3d"
3537,_DAVID GRAY._,"December of the same year, when he died. That is the brief record of"
3538,_DAVID GRAY._,"this young poet’s life—almost all the incidents in it, all the events"
3539,_DAVID GRAY._,"connected with it. But who can record, or who shall attempt to record"
3540,_DAVID GRAY._,"the thousand thoughts and emotions that passed through his mind, that"
3541,_DAVID GRAY._,"illuminated his fancy, and that kindled his genius? Who shall say how"
3542,_DAVID GRAY._,"these familiar woods, and fields, and glens, and streams were to him"
3543,_DAVID GRAY._,"dearer, a thousand times dearer and more romantic, than any woods,"
3544,_DAVID GRAY._,"or fields, or glens, or streams in any other part of the world. No"
3545,_DAVID GRAY._,"man but a true poet has that warm affection for home scenes, for his"
3546,_DAVID GRAY._,"country, for his native land, for the friends of his youth; no man but"
3547,_DAVID GRAY._,a true poet has those sentiments in their height and in their depth;
3548,_DAVID GRAY._,"and if ever a man entertained them, the poetical remains of David"
3549,_DAVID GRAY._,"Gray prove that he had them in a deep, pathetic, and most earnest"
3550,_DAVID GRAY._,"manner. Upon his death-bed, within three days of his death, he received"
3551,_DAVID GRAY._,what appears to me to be a particularly beautiful letter from Marian
3552,_DAVID GRAY._,"James, breathing that _alma gentile_ which none but a refined and pure"
3553,_DAVID GRAY._,"woman possesses. I never saw David Gray, but I have seen to-night the"
3554,_DAVID GRAY._,humble room in which he was born; I have seen the home in which he
3555,_DAVID GRAY._,"was afterwards reared—a simple, rural house, belonging to a simple,"
3556,_DAVID GRAY._,"honest, and upright family, such a family as Scotland is always proud"
3557,_DAVID GRAY._,of—and of such families I am proud to know that Scotland possesses her
3558,_DAVID GRAY._,"thousands and tens of thousands. I saw his mother to-night, and was"
3559,_DAVID GRAY._,deeply impressed with the apparent simplicity and earnestness of her
3560,_DAVID GRAY._,character. I owe her my gratitude and my thanks for her presenting
3561,_DAVID GRAY._,"me with a book which belonged to her son, and which contains many"
3562,_DAVID GRAY._,of his private markings. I shall always retain it as a valuable and
3563,_DAVID GRAY._,most esteemed possession. David Gray’s poetical susceptibility was of
3564,_DAVID GRAY._,the most conspicuous description. He had a most refined perception
3565,_DAVID GRAY._,of the beautiful; he had a perception of an interminable vista of
3566,_DAVID GRAY._,"beauty and truth. He had noble and pure thoughts, and he has been"
3567,_DAVID GRAY._,enabled to express those noble and pure thoughts in very noble and
3568,_DAVID GRAY._,"pure language. “The Luggie” is a most remarkable poem, containing"
3569,_DAVID GRAY._,"many very fine passages, inspired partially, no doubt, by a careful"
3570,_DAVID GRAY._,"perusal of Thomson’s “Seasons” and Wordsworth’s “Excursion,” and not,"
3571,_DAVID GRAY._,"therefore, so entirely original as some of the author’s subsequent"
3572,_DAVID GRAY._,poems; but with passages breaking out in it every now and then which
3573,_DAVID GRAY._,"neither Thomson nor Wordsworth suggested, and which are entirely the"
3574,_DAVID GRAY._,"conceptions of David Gray’s own genius. “The Luggie,” as has been well"
3575,_DAVID GRAY._,"said, “may not possess in itself much to attract the painter’s eye,"
3576,_DAVID GRAY._,but it has sufficed for a poet’s love.” The series of sonnets entitled
3577,_DAVID GRAY._,“In the Shadows”—written by the poet during his last illness—many of
3578,_DAVID GRAY._,"them bearing relation to his own condition, his own life, and his"
3579,_DAVID GRAY._,own prospects—appear to me to possess a solemn beauty not surpassed
3580,_DAVID GRAY._,"by many of the finest passages in Tennyson’s “In Memoriam,” totally"
3581,_DAVID GRAY._,"distinct and unlike the “In Memoriam,” but as genuine, as sincere,"
3582,_DAVID GRAY._,"as heart-stirring, and often as poetical. In the author’s own words,"
3583,_DAVID GRAY._,they admit you “to the chancel of a dying poet’s mind;” you feel when
3584,_DAVID GRAY._,you are reading these sonnets that they are written in the sure and
3585,_DAVID GRAY._,"immediate prospect of death; but they contain thoughts about life,"
3586,_DAVID GRAY._,"about the past, and about the future, most powerful and most beautiful."
3587,_DAVID GRAY._,"I am not going to ask you to take all this for granted. I think,"
3588,_DAVID GRAY._,"upon an occasion like this, we ought to show some little reason for"
3589,_DAVID GRAY._,"the faith that is in us; and, if it will not fatigue you too much, I"
3590,_DAVID GRAY._,propose in a few minutes to read two or three of those passages and
3591,_DAVID GRAY._,those sonnets which strike me as worthy of all admiration. I feel
3592,_DAVID GRAY._,confident that these works are destined to take their place amongst
3593,_DAVID GRAY._,standard poetical works in the library of every man of literary taste.
3594,_DAVID GRAY._,"We are here, as you have said, upon the occasion of the erection of"
3595,_DAVID GRAY._,a monument to David Gray—a monument erected on the spot where he is
3596,_DAVID GRAY._,"buried, in a beautiful old churchyard, standing upon the brow of a"
3597,_DAVID GRAY._,"hill, from which a fine and extensive view of the surrounding valley"
3598,_DAVID GRAY._,"and hills is commanded. It is a granite monument, and will last, I"
3599,_DAVID GRAY._,"hope, for centuries. I am sure that in this neighbourhood it will"
3600,_DAVID GRAY._,often be visited by persons who feel something like kindred emotions
3601,_DAVID GRAY._,"with David Gray, and they will be proud of this neighbourhood that"
3602,_DAVID GRAY._,it gave birth in that humble cottage to a man who has added so much
3603,_DAVID GRAY._,"charm to its natural scenery. It was felt at the same time, I believe,"
3604,_DAVID GRAY._,"by the gentlemen in Glasgow who took the principal charge of it,"
3605,_DAVID GRAY._,that a great or imposing monument was not the thing that was wanted.
3606,_DAVID GRAY._,"A plain, simple, enduring record of respect and esteem was what was"
3607,_DAVID GRAY._,"wished. Therefore, although the fund I know could have been trebled,"
3608,_DAVID GRAY._,"quadrupled, with ease, it was thought that when a certain moderate"
3609,_DAVID GRAY._,"sum was obtained that was enough, and by the aid of the genius of"
3610,_DAVID GRAY._,"our townsman, Mr. Mossman, I venture to say that an appropriate and"
3611,_DAVID GRAY._,suitable monument has now been erected on that spot. I may mention
3612,_DAVID GRAY._,that I find the names in the list of subscribers very varied. Among
3613,_DAVID GRAY._,"the Glasgow subscribers I find the name of Mrs. Nichol, widow of the"
3614,_DAVID GRAY._,"late Professor of Astronomy in our University, who I know took a great"
3615,_DAVID GRAY._,"interest in David Gray from first to last, and who, I know also,"
3616,_DAVID GRAY._,"with her usual benevolence, aided in smoothing his dying pillow. I"
3617,_DAVID GRAY._,"find the name of William Logan, one of the most earnest and attached"
3618,_DAVID GRAY._,friends that David Gray ever had; I find Lord Houghton; I find Mr.
3619,_DAVID GRAY._,"Bailie Cochrane; I find Mr. Stirling of Keir, the Hon. Julia Fane, the"
3620,_DAVID GRAY._,"Dowager Duchess of Sutherland, Mr. Macmillan, Mr. MacLehose, Mr. J."
3621,_DAVID GRAY._,"A. Campbell, Mr. Hutton, editor of the London _Spectator_, and many"
3622,_DAVID GRAY._,other names. Now Lord Houghton was requested to write an appropriate
3623,_DAVID GRAY._,inscription for this monument. I know it was a labour of love with
3624,_DAVID GRAY._,"him, and I know he was anxious to write such an epitaph as would be"
3625,_DAVID GRAY._,"thought suitable both here and elsewhere; and I venture to say, and I"
3626,_DAVID GRAY._,"hope you will agree with me, that he has admirably succeeded in the"
3627,_DAVID GRAY._,simplicity and truth of that epitaph which has now been engraved on the
3628,_DAVID GRAY._,monument. Such is the young man whose fame we shall not willingly let
3629,_DAVID GRAY._,"die, because they who read his works aright derive moral improvement"
3630,_DAVID GRAY._,"and intellectual benefit from them—because, young as he was when he"
3631,_DAVID GRAY._,"died, he cherished pure and noble thoughts, and because he has left"
3632,_DAVID GRAY._,"those pure and noble thoughts as a record to us of his life, and as an"
3633,_DAVID GRAY._,"incentive to us to endeavour to cherish similar thoughts. Therefore,"
3634,_DAVID GRAY._,"we owe him a debt of gratitude; and, therefore, without attempting to"
3635,_DAVID GRAY._,raise him upon a pinnacle too high—for his life was cut short before
3636,_DAVID GRAY._,the highest aims of his ambition were attained—let it go forth that no
3637,_DAVID GRAY._,"true poet in this land, be his position in life what it may, be his"
3638,_DAVID GRAY._,"birth humble or great—no true poet, no great teacher of the hearts of"
3639,_DAVID GRAY._,"men, will ever find an ungrateful country in Scotland, as long as it"
3640,_DAVID GRAY._,remembers its great poets—as long as it knows that it is the land
3641,_DAVID GRAY._,"of Burns. In “The Luggie,” which you are aware is a descriptive and"
3642,_DAVID GRAY._,"pastoral poem, there are varied moods of thought. There is a good deal"
3643,_DAVID GRAY._,"of mere description of beautiful scenery, but that, whilst exquisitely"
3644,_DAVID GRAY._,"done, is also intermingled with many thoughts and feelings which add a"
3645,_DAVID GRAY._,richness to the charm of the poet’s description. No mere description
3646,_DAVID GRAY._,"of external and lifeless nature, unless brought home to the heart by"
3647,_DAVID GRAY._,"allusions to human emotion, can ever produce a very strong effect. But"
3648,_DAVID GRAY._,David Gray seems to have understood admirably how to combine those
3649,_DAVID GRAY._,"two qualities in his descriptive picture, and whilst he describes"
3650,_DAVID GRAY._,"beautiful external nature, he always takes care at the same time to"
3651,_DAVID GRAY._,attract and touch the feelings. I am happy to know that David Gray
3652,_DAVID GRAY._,"died in true Christian faith, and amity with all men. I know from the"
3653,_DAVID GRAY._,"esteemed clergyman who attended him weekly for many a day, that he had"
3654,_DAVID GRAY._,"those true Christian sentiments which become a man, and most of all"
3655,_DAVID GRAY._,"become a great man, upon his death-bed. I have had the very greatest"
3656,_DAVID GRAY._,satisfaction in being present to-night. I felt it to be an honour to
3657,_DAVID GRAY._,be requested to come here and express my sentiments on such a subject.
3658,_DAVID GRAY._,"It is an honour which I feel, and it is a pleasure which I feel still"
3659,_DAVID GRAY._,"more, for when a man has passed through this world now for a good"
3660,_DAVID GRAY._,"many years, as I have done, there can be nothing dearer to his heart"
3661,_DAVID GRAY._,"than expressing sympathy with the great and good, and feeling those"
3662,_DAVID GRAY._,expressions of sympathy reflected from the hearts and the eyes of a
3663,_DAVID GRAY._,sympathising audience.

3794,_HANNIBAL_:,"“After the lapse of many centuries, an English Poet is found"
3795,_HANNIBAL_:,paying to the great Carthaginian the worthiest poetical tribute
3796,_HANNIBAL_:,"which has as yet, to our knowledge, been offered to his noble"
3797,_HANNIBAL_:,and stainless name.”

3800,_HANNIBAL_:,“Probably the best and most accurate conception of Hannibal
3801,_HANNIBAL_:,ever yet given in English. Professor Nichol has done a really
3802,_HANNIBAL_:,valuable work. From first to last of the whole five acts there
3803,_HANNIBAL_:,is hardly a page that sinks to the level of mediocrity.”

3806,_HANNIBAL_:,“Professor Nichol has just given us a volume which bids fair to
3807,_HANNIBAL_:,"open a new era in poetry, and secures to the author a position"

3811,_HANNIBAL_:,“Glasgow has good reason to be proud of her Professor of
3812,_HANNIBAL_:,"English Literature, in which he now takes a prominent place by"
3813,_HANNIBAL_:,right of his admirable classic drama. Criticism will award him
3814,_HANNIBAL_:,"a regal seat on Parnassus, and laurel leaves without stint.”"
