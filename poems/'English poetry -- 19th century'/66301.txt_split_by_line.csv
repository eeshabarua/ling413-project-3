640,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,Cheaply benignant[9].
641,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,
642,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"[1] Who this Harris was, is a point about which the commentators are at"
643,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"variance. Some say, but erroneously as I think, that he was the “puer,”"
644,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"the “minister,” of the poet. But this is not probable, for to such"
645,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"persons odes were not then commonly addressed. No! Harris was no servant,"
646,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"he was the friend, the “commensalis,” the fellow-messman of the author at"
647,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,the cuddy table; whom he may be supposed to be inviting to the erratic
648,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"fish, which, under the influence of a gale, has become as locomotive as"
649,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,ever it was in its own native element.
650,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,
651,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"[2] Why civic, since the entertainment was nautical? ask some"
652,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,matter-of-fact critics. Do not these blunderers perceive the
653,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,delicately-veiled compliment to the owners of the vessel upon the
654,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,richness and profusion of the viands?
655,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,
656,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"[3] “Simulating ven’son.” This process is, unfortunately, in some degree"
657,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"lost to us. Some say that mutton was made to resemble venison, by being"
658,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"roasted with the wool on. Others, that it was the flesh of a seven-year"
659,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"old male, _not a wether_. But neither of these conjectures is correct."
660,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"The meat was probably steeped in a brine compounded of wine, salt,"
661,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"spices, sugar, and other condiments, and sprinkled with Irish blackguard"
662,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,and brickdust.
663,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,
664,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,[4] “Catch.” Some critics would substitute “reach” for “catch.” But who
665,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"does not see the witty allusion to the unsteadiness of the table, to"
666,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,which these dull dogs are blind?
667,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,
668,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,[5] “Still.” Free from motion.
669,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,
670,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,[6] “Watery potatoes.” This expression is very enigmatical. Some
671,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"understand by it “dressed in, or by means of water,” as potatoes boiled"
672,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"or steamed, in opposition to roasted, baked, or fried potatoes, his"
673,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,preference for which the author is supposed to insinuate. But in my
674,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"opinion this reading, though ingenious, is not correct; the true sense"
675,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"of the expression is potatoes carried by water, that is, potatoes eaten"
676,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"at sea. Murphyius, however, that intemperate though erudite Hibernian"
677,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"critic, declares that it means any potato not Irish, which last alone, as"
678,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"he says, were free when dressed from superfluous moisture. He contends,"
679,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,that the potato esteemed by epicures was a mealy potato. But he offers
680,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,nothing in proof of his assertion.
681,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,
682,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,[7] “Lap.” This is plainly a misreading for “plate.” It would have been
683,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"an unfriendly and unamiable wish had the author prayed that liquids,"
684,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"as soups and sauces were, should fall into the lap of his friend, of"
685,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,which it would naturally have been irretentive. It is easy to trace the
686,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"corruption of the text. “Plate” has been written with an elision, “pla,”"
687,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,by a copyist studious of his ease. The now final vowel has slipped into
688,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"the middle place and formed “pal;” which a careless scribe, putting the"
689,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"cart before the horse, has changed into “lap.”"
690,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,
691,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,[8] “Derelict.” This implies the departure from the table of some
692,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,squeamish person without the “animus revertendi.”
693,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,
694,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"[9] “Cheaply benignant,” that is, dispensing things not its own, liberal"
695,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"at the expense of others; as a generous churchwarden, a chairman"
696,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"distributing prizes, a prime minister filling up a pension-list, a House"
697,ODE TO HARRIS[1].,"of Commons voting supplies, or an attorney marking undelivered briefs for"
