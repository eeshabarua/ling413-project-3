201,XVII.,
202,XVIII.,XVIII.
203,XVIII.,
204,XVIII.,The wind that swept them out of sin
205,XVIII.,Has ruffled all our vesture:

208,XVIII.,
209,XIX.,XIX.
210,XIX.,
211,XIX.,"To us, us also, open straight!"

230,XXII.,XXII.
231,XXII.,
232,XXII.,"But God gives patience, Love learns strength,"

1004,XI.,This weary minstrel-life that once was girt
1005,XI.,"To climb Aornus, and can scarce avail"
1006,XI.,To pipe now 'gainst the valley nightingale

1008,XI.,"To these things? O Belovèd, it is plain"
1009,XI.,I am not of thy worth nor for thy place!
1010,XI.,"And yet, because I love thee, I obtain"
1011,XI.,"From that same love this vindicating grace,"

1023,XII.,"I should not love withal, unless that thou"
1024,XII.,"Hadst set me an example, shown me how,"
1025,XII.,"When first thine earnest eyes with mine were crossed,"
1026,XII.,"And love called love. And thus, I cannot speak"
1027,XII.,"Of love even, as a good thing of my own:"
1028,XII.,"Thy soul hath snatched up mine all faint and weak,"
1029,XII.,"And placed it by thee on a golden throne,--"
1030,XII.,"And that I love (O soul, we must be meek!)"

1039,XIII.,"Between our faces, to cast light on each?--"
1040,XIII.,I drop it at thy feet. I cannot teach
1041,XIII.,My hand to hold my spirit so far off
1042,XIII.,From myself--me--that I should bring thee proof
1043,XIII.,"In words, of love hid in me out of reach."
1044,XIII.,"Nay, let the silence of my womanhood"
1045,XIII.,"Commend my woman-love to thy belief,--"
1046,XIII.,"Seeing that I stand unwon, however wooed,"

1060,XIV.,"For these things in themselves, Belovèd, may"
1061,XIV.,"Be changed, or change for thee,--and love, so wrought,"

1079,XV.,And to spread wing and fly in the outer air
1080,XV.,"Were most impossible failure, if I strove"
1081,XV.,To fail so. But I look on thee--on thee--
1082,XV.,"Beholding, besides love, the end of love,"

1093,XVI.,"Thy purple round me, till my heart shall grow"
1094,XVI.,Too close against thine heart henceforth to know
1095,XVI.,"How it shook when alone. Why, conquering"
1096,XVI.,May prove as lordly and complete a thing

1099,XVI.,"To one who lifts him from the bloody earth,"
1100,XVI.,"Even so, Belovèd, I at last record,"

1112,XVII.,In a serene air purely. Antidotes
1113,XVII.,"Of medicated music, answering for"
1114,XVII.,"Mankind's forlornest uses, thou canst pour"
1115,XVII.,From thence into their ears. God's will devotes
1116,XVII.,"Thine to such ends, and mine to wait on thine."
1117,XVII.,"How, Dearest, wilt thou have me for most use?"
1118,XVII.,"A hope, to sing by gladly? or a fine"

1135,XVIII.,Taught drooping from the head that hangs aside
1136,XVIII.,Through sorrow's trick. I thought the funeral-shears

1258,XXV.,"Were changed to long despairs, till God's own grace"

1274,XXVI.,But soon their trailing purple was not free
1275,XXVI.,"Of this world's dust, their lutes did silent grow,"
1276,XXVI.,And I myself grew faint and blind below
1277,XXVI.,"Their vanishing eyes. Then THOU didst come--to be,"
1278,XXVI.,"Belovèd, what they seemed. Their shining fronts,"
1279,XXVI.,"Their songs, their splendours (better, yet the same,"

1293,XXVII.,"Before thy saving kiss! My own, my own,"

1295,XXVII.,"And I who looked for only God, found _thee_!"
1296,XXVII.,"I find thee; I am safe, and strong, and glad."
1297,XXVII.,As one who stands in dewless asphodel

1299,XXVII.,"In the upper life,--so I, with bosom-swell,"

1310,XXVIII.,"This said,--he wished to have me in his sight"
1311,XXVIII.,"Once, as a friend: this fixed a day in spring"
1312,XXVIII.,"To come and touch my hand ... a simple thing,"

1328,XXIX.,"Yet, O my palm-tree, be it understood"

1440,XXXV.,"That's hardest. If to conquer love, has tried,"
1441,XXXV.,"To conquer grief, tries more, as all things prove;"
1442,XXXV.,For grief indeed is love and grief beside.

1453,XXXVI.,"Sorrow and sorrow? Nay, I rather thrilled,"
1454,XXXVI.,Distrusting every light that seemed to gild
1455,XXXVI.,"The onward path, and feared to overlean"
1456,XXXVI.,"A finger even. And, though I have grown serene"
1457,XXXVI.,"And strong since then, I think that God has willed"
1458,XXXVI.,"A still renewable fear ... O love, O troth ..."
1459,XXXVI.,"Lest these enclaspèd hands should never hold,"
1460,XXXVI.,This mutual kiss drop down between us both
1461,XXXVI.,"As an unowned thing, once the lips being cold."

1472,XXXVII.,It is that distant years which did not take
1473,XXXVII.,"Thy sovranty, recoiling with a blow,"
1474,XXXVII.,Have forced my swimming brain to undergo
1475,XXXVII.,"Their doubt and dread, and blindly to forsake"
1476,XXXVII.,Thy purity of likeness and distort

1493,XXXVIII.,"The first, and sought the forehead, and half missed,"

1495,XXXVIII.,"That was the chrism of love, which love's own crown,"

1619,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
1620,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,This poem contains the impressions of the writer upon events in
1621,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"Tuscany of which she was a witness. ""From a window,"" the critic may"
1622,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,demur. She bows to the objection in the very title of her work. No
1623,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,continuous narrative nor exposition of political philosophy is
1624,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"attempted by her. It is a simple story of personal impressions, whose"
1625,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"only value is in the intensity with which they were received, as"
1626,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"proving her warm affection for a beautiful and unfortunate country,"
1627,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"and the sincerity with which they are related, as indicating her own"
1628,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,good faith and freedom from partisanship.
1629,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
1630,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"Of the two parts of this poem, the first was written nearly three"
1631,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"years ago, while the second resumes the actual situation of 1851. The"
1632,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,discrepancy between the two parts is a sufficient guarantee to the
1633,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"public of the truthfulness of the writer, who, though she certainly"
1634,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"escaped the epidemic ""falling sickness"" of enthusiasm for Pio Nono,"
1635,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"takes shame upon herself that she believed, like a woman, some royal"
1636,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"oaths, and lost sight of the probable consequences of some obvious"
1637,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"popular defects. If the discrepancy should be painful to the reader,"
1638,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,let him understand that to the writer it has been more so. But such
1639,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,discrepancies we are called upon to accept at every hour by the
1640,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"conditions of our nature, implying the interval between aspiration"
1641,ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"and performance, between faith and disillusion, between hope and"

1661,PART I.,I heard last night a little child go singing
1662,PART I.,"'Neath Casa Guidi windows, by the church,"
1663,PART I.,"_O bella libertà, O bella!_--stringing"
1664,PART I.,The same words still on notes he went in search
1665,PART I.,"So high for, you concluded the upspringing"
1666,PART I.,Of such a nimble bird to sky from perch
1667,PART I.,"Must leave the whole bush in a tremble green,"
1668,PART I.,"And that the heart of Italy must beat,"
1669,PART I.,While such a voice had leave to rise serene
1670,PART I.,'Twixt church and palace of a Florence street:
1671,PART I.,"A little child, too, who not long had been"
1672,PART I.,"By mother's finger steadied on his feet,"
1673,PART I.,And still _O bella libertà_ he sang.
1674,PART I.,
1675,PART I.,"Then I thought, musing, of the innumerous"
1676,PART I.,Sweet songs which still for Italy outrang
1677,PART I.,From older singers' lips who sang not thus
1678,PART I.,"Exultingly and purely, yet, with pang"
1679,PART I.,"Fast sheathed in music, touched the heart of us"
1680,PART I.,So finely that the pity scarcely pained.
1681,PART I.,"I thought how Filicaja led on others,"
1682,PART I.,"Bewailers for their Italy enchained,"
1683,PART I.,"And how they called her childless among mothers,"
1684,PART I.,"Widow of empires, ay, and scarce refrained"
1685,PART I.,"Cursing her beauty to her face, as brothers"
1686,PART I.,"Might a shamed sister's,--""Had she been less fair"
1687,PART I.,"She were less wretched;""--how, evoking so"
1688,PART I.,From congregated wrong and heaped despair
1689,PART I.,"Of men and women writhing under blow,"
1690,PART I.,"Harrowed and hideous in a filthy lair,"
1691,PART I.,Some personating Image wherein woe
1692,PART I.,"Was wrapt in beauty from offending much,"
1693,PART I.,"They called it Cybele, or Niobe,"
1694,PART I.,"Or laid it corpse-like on a bier for such,"
1695,PART I.,Where all the world might drop for Italy
1696,PART I.,"Those cadenced tears which burn not where they touch,--"
1697,PART I.,"""Juliet of nations, canst thou die as we?"
1698,PART I.,And was the violet crown that crowned thy head
1699,PART I.,"So over-large, though new buds made it rough,"
1700,PART I.,"It slipped down and across thine eyelids dead,"
1701,PART I.,"O sweet, fair Juliet?"" Of such songs enough,"
1702,PART I.,"Too many of such complaints! behold, instead,"
1703,PART I.,"Void at Verona, Juliet's marble trough:[2]"
1704,PART I.,"As void as that is, are all images"
1705,PART I.,"Men set between themselves and actual wrong,"
1706,PART I.,"To catch the weight of pity, meet the stress"
1707,PART I.,"Of conscience,--since 't is easier to gaze long"
1708,PART I.,On mournful masks and sad effigies
1709,PART I.,"Than on real, live, weak creatures crushed by strong."
1710,PART I.,
1711,PART I.,For me who stand in Italy to-day
1712,PART I.,"Where worthier poets stood and sang before,"
1713,PART I.,I kiss their footsteps yet their words gainsay.
1714,PART I.,I can but muse in hope upon this shore
1715,PART I.,Of golden Arno as it shoots away
1716,PART I.,Through Florence' heart beneath her bridges four:
1717,PART I.,"Bent bridges, seeming to strain off like bows,"
1718,PART I.,And tremble while the arrowy undertide
1719,PART I.,"Shoots on and cleaves the marble as it goes,"
1720,PART I.,"And strikes up palace-walls on either side,"
1721,PART I.,"And froths the cornice out in glittering rows,"
1722,PART I.,"With doors and windows quaintly multiplied,"
1723,PART I.,"And terrace-sweeps, and gazers upon all,"
1724,PART I.,By whom if flower or kerchief were thrown out
1725,PART I.,"From any lattice there, the same would fall"
1726,PART I.,"Into the river underneath, no doubt,"
1727,PART I.,It runs so close and fast 'twixt wall and wall.
1728,PART I.,How beautiful! the mountains from without
1729,PART I.,In silence listen for the word said next.
1730,PART I.,"What word will men say,--here where Giotto planted"
1731,PART I.,His campanile like an unperplexed
1732,PART I.,"Fine question Heavenward, touching the things granted"
1733,PART I.,"A noble people who, being greatly vexed"
1734,PART I.,"In act, in aspiration keep undaunted?"
1735,PART I.,What word will God say? Michel's Night and Day
1736,PART I.,And Dawn and Twilight wait in marble scorn[3]
1737,PART I.,"Like dogs upon a dunghill, couched on clay"
1738,PART I.,"From whence the Medicean stamp's outworn,"
1739,PART I.,The final putting off of all such sway
1740,PART I.,"By all such hands, and freeing of the unborn"
1741,PART I.,In Florence and the great world outside Florence.
1742,PART I.,Three hundred years his patient statues wait
1743,PART I.,In that small chapel of the dim Saint Lawrence:
1744,PART I.,Day's eyes are breaking bold and passionate
1745,PART I.,"Over his shoulder, and will flash abhorrence"
1746,PART I.,"On darkness and with level looks meet fate,"
1747,PART I.,When once loose from that marble film of theirs;
1748,PART I.,"The Night has wild dreams in her sleep, the Dawn"
1749,PART I.,"Is haggard as the sleepless, Twilight wears"
1750,PART I.,A sort of horror; as the veil withdrawn
1751,PART I.,'Twixt the artist's soul and works had left them heirs
1752,PART I.,"Of speechless thoughts which would not quail nor fawn,"
1753,PART I.,"Of angers and contempts, of hope and love:"
1754,PART I.,For not without a meaning did he place
1755,PART I.,The princely Urbino on the seat above
1756,PART I.,"With everlasting shadow on his face,"
1757,PART I.,While the slow dawns and twilights disapprove
1758,PART I.,The ashes of his long-extinguished race
1759,PART I.,Which never more shall clog the feet of men.
1760,PART I.,"I do believe, divinest Angelo,"
1761,PART I.,"That winter-hour in Via Larga, when"
1762,PART I.,They bade thee build a statue up in snow[4]
1763,PART I.,And straight that marvel of thine art again
1764,PART I.,"Dissolved beneath the sun's Italian glow,"
1765,PART I.,"Thine eyes, dilated with the plastic passion,"
1766,PART I.,"Thawing too in drops of wounded manhood, since,"
1767,PART I.,"To mock alike thine art and indignation,"
1768,PART I.,"Laughed at the palace-window the new prince,--"
1769,PART I.,"(""Aha! this genius needs for exaltation,"
1770,PART I.,"When all's said and however the proud may wince,"
1771,PART I.,"A little marble from our princely mines!"")"
1772,PART I.,I do believe that hour thou laughedst too
1773,PART I.,"For the whole sad world and for thy Florentines,"
1774,PART I.,"After those few tears, which were only few!"
1775,PART I.,"That as, beneath the sun, the grand white lines"
1776,PART I.,"Of thy snow-statue trembled and withdrew,--"
1777,PART I.,"The head, erect as Jove's, being palsied first,"
1778,PART I.,"The eyelids flattened, the full brow turned blank,"
1779,PART I.,"The right-hand, raised but now as if it cursed,"
1780,PART I.,"Dropt, a mere snowball, (till the people sank"
1781,PART I.,"Their voices, though a louder laughter burst"
1782,PART I.,From the royal window)--thou couldst proudly thank
1783,PART I.,"God and the prince for promise and presage,"
1784,PART I.,"And laugh the laugh back, I think verily,"
1785,PART I.,Thine eyes being purged by tears of righteous rage
1786,PART I.,"To read a wrong into a prophecy,"
1787,PART I.,And measure a true great man's heritage
1788,PART I.,Against a mere great-duke's posterity.
1789,PART I.,"I think thy soul said then, ""I do not need"
1790,PART I.,"A princedom and its quarries, after all;"
1791,PART I.,"For if I write, paint, carve a word, indeed,"
1792,PART I.,"On book or board or dust, on floor or wall,"
1793,PART I.,The same is kept of God who taketh heed
1794,PART I.,That not a letter of the meaning fall
1795,PART I.,"Or ere it touch and teach His world's deep heart,"
1796,PART I.,"Outlasting, therefore, all your lordships, sir!"
1797,PART I.,"So keep your stone, beseech you, for your part,"
1798,PART I.,To cover up your grave-place and refer
1799,PART I.,The proper titles; _I_ live by my art.
1800,PART I.,The thought I threw into this snow shall stir
1801,PART I.,This gazing people when their gaze is done;
1802,PART I.,"And the tradition of your act and mine,"
1803,PART I.,"When all the snow is melted in the sun,"
1804,PART I.,"Shall gather up, for unborn men, a sign"
1805,PART I.,"Of what is the true princedom,--ay, and none"
1806,PART I.,"Shall laugh that day, except the drunk with wine."""
1807,PART I.,
1808,PART I.,"Amen, great Angelo! the day's at hand."
1809,PART I.,"If many laugh not on it, shall we weep?"
1810,PART I.,"Much more we must not, let us understand."
1811,PART I.,Through rhymers sonneteering in their sleep
1812,PART I.,And archaists mumbling dry bones up the land
1813,PART I.,"And sketchers lauding ruined towns a-heap,--"
1814,PART I.,"Through all that drowsy hum of voices smooth,"
1815,PART I.,"The hopeful bird mounts carolling from brake,"
1816,PART I.,"The hopeful child, with leaps to catch his growth,"
1817,PART I.,Sings open-eyed for liberty's sweet sake:
1818,PART I.,"And I, a singer also from my youth,"
1819,PART I.,"Prefer to sing with these who are awake,"
1820,PART I.,"With birds, with babes, with men who will not fear"
1821,PART I.,"The baptism of the holy morning dew,"
1822,PART I.,"(And many of such wakers now are here,"
1823,PART I.,"Complete in their anointed manhood, who"
1824,PART I.,"Will greatly dare and greatlier persevere,)"
1825,PART I.,"Than join those old thin voices with my new,"
1826,PART I.,And sigh for Italy with some safe sigh
1827,PART I.,"Cooped up in music 'twixt an oh and ah,--"
1828,PART I.,"Nay, hand in hand with that young child, will I"
1829,PART I.,"Go singing rather, ""_Bella libertà_,"""
1830,PART I.,"Than, with those poets, croon the dead or cry"
1831,PART I.,"""_Se tu men bella fossi, Italia!_"""
1832,PART I.,
1833,PART I.,"""Less wretched if less fair."" Perhaps a truth"
1834,PART I.,"Is so far plain in this, that Italy,"
1835,PART I.,Long trammelled with the purple of her youth
1836,PART I.,"Against her age's ripe activity,"
1837,PART I.,"Sits still upon her tombs, without death's ruth"
1838,PART I.,But also without life's brave energy.
1839,PART I.,"""Now tell us what is Italy?"" men ask:"
1840,PART I.,"And others answer, ""Virgil, Cicero,"
1841,PART I.,"Catullus, Cæsar."" What beside? to task"
1842,PART I.,"The memory closer--""Why, Boccaccio,"
1843,PART I.,"Dante, Petrarca,""--and if still the flask"
1844,PART I.,"Appears to yield its wine by drops too slow,--"
1845,PART I.,"""Angelo, Raffael, Pergolese,""--all"
1846,PART I.,"Whose strong hearts beat through stone, or charged again"
1847,PART I.,"The paints with fire of souls electrical,"
1848,PART I.,Or broke up heaven for music. What more then?
1849,PART I.,"Why, then, no more. The chaplet's last beads fall"
1850,PART I.,"In naming the last saintship within ken,"
1851,PART I.,"And, after that, none prayeth in the land."
1852,PART I.,"Alas, this Italy has too long swept"
1853,PART I.,Heroic ashes up for hour-glass sand;
1854,PART I.,"Of her own past, impassioned nympholept!"
1855,PART I.,Consenting to be nailed here by the hand
1856,PART I.,To the very bay-tree under which she stept
1857,PART I.,"A queen of old, and plucked a leafy branch;"
1858,PART I.,"And, licensing the world too long indeed"
1859,PART I.,To use her broad phylacteries to staunch
1860,PART I.,"And stop her bloody lips, she takes no heed"
1861,PART I.,How one clear word would draw an avalanche
1862,PART I.,"Of living sons around her, to succeed"
1863,PART I.,The vanished generations. Can she count
1864,PART I.,These oil-eaters with large live mobile mouths
1865,PART I.,"Agape for macaroni, in the amount"
1866,PART I.,Of consecrated heroes of her south's
1867,PART I.,"Bright rosary? The pitcher at the fount,"
1868,PART I.,"The gift of gods, being broken, she much loathes"
1869,PART I.,To let the ground-leaves of the place confer
1870,PART I.,A natural bowl. So henceforth she would seem
1871,PART I.,"No nation, but the poet's pensioner,"
1872,PART I.,"With alms from every land of song and dream,"
1873,PART I.,While aye her pipers sadly pipe of her
1874,PART I.,"Until their proper breaths, in that extreme"
1875,PART I.,"Of sighing, split the reed on which they played:"
1876,PART I.,"Of which, no more. But never say ""no more"""
1877,PART I.,To Italy's life! Her memories undismayed
1878,PART I.,"Still argue ""evermore;"" her graves implore"
1879,PART I.,Her future to be strong and not afraid;
1880,PART I.,Her very statues send their looks before.
1881,PART I.,
1882,PART I.,We do not serve the dead--the past is past.
1883,PART I.,"God lives, and lifts His glorious mornings up"
1884,PART I.,"Before the eyes of men awake at last,"
1885,PART I.,"Who put away the meats they used to sup,"
1886,PART I.,And down upon the dust of earth outcast
1887,PART I.,"The dregs remaining of the ancient cup,"
1888,PART I.,Then turn to wakeful prayer and worthy act.
1889,PART I.,"The Dead, upon their awful 'vantage ground,"
1890,PART I.,"The sun not in their faces, shall abstract"
1891,PART I.,No more our strength; we will not be discrowned
1892,PART I.,"As guardians of their crowns, nor deign transact"
1893,PART I.,"A barter of the present, for a sound"
1894,PART I.,Of good so counted in the foregone days.
1895,PART I.,"O Dead, ye shall no longer cling to us"
1896,PART I.,"With rigid hands of desiccating praise,"
1897,PART I.,"And drag us backward by the garment thus,"
1898,PART I.,To stand and laud you in long-drawn virelays!
1899,PART I.,We will not henceforth be oblivious
1900,PART I.,"Of our own lives, because ye lived before,"
1901,PART I.,"Nor of our acts, because ye acted well."
1902,PART I.,"We thank you that ye first unlatched the door,"
1903,PART I.,But will not make it inaccessible
1904,PART I.,By thankings on the threshold any more.
1905,PART I.,We hurry onward to extinguish hell
1906,PART I.,"With our fresh souls, our younger hope, and God's"
1907,PART I.,Maturity of purpose. Soon shall we
1908,PART I.,"Die also! and, that then our periods"
1909,PART I.,Of life may round themselves to memory
1910,PART I.,"As smoothly as on our graves the burial-sods,"
1911,PART I.,"We now must look to it to excel as ye,"
1912,PART I.,"And bear our age as far, unlimited"
1913,PART I.,"By the last mind-mark; so, to be invoked"
1914,PART I.,"By future generations, as their Dead."
1915,PART I.,
1916,PART I.,'T is true that when the dust of death has choked
1917,PART I.,"A great man's voice, the common words he said"
1918,PART I.,"Turn oracles, the common thoughts he yoked"
1919,PART I.,"Like horses, draw like griffins: this is true"
1920,PART I.,"And acceptable. I, too, should desire,"
1921,PART I.,"When men make record, with the flowers they strew,"
1922,PART I.,"""Savonarola's soul went out in fire"
1923,PART I.,"Upon our Grand-duke's piazza,[5] and burned through"
1924,PART I.,"A moment first, or ere he did expire,"
1925,PART I.,"The veil betwixt the right and wrong, and showed"
1926,PART I.,"How near God sat and judged the judges there,--"""
1927,PART I.,Upon the self-same pavement overstrewed
1928,PART I.,"To cast my violets with as reverent care,"
1929,PART I.,And prove that all the winters which have snowed
1930,PART I.,"Cannot snow out the scent from stones and air,"
1931,PART I.,"Of a sincere man's virtues. This was he,"
1932,PART I.,"Savonarola, who, while Peter sank"
1933,PART I.,"With his whole boat-load, called courageously"
1934,PART I.,"""Wake Christ, wake Christ!""--who, having tried the tank"
1935,PART I.,Of old church-waters used for baptistry
1936,PART I.,"Ere Luther came to spill them, swore they stank;"
1937,PART I.,"Who also by a princely deathbed cried,"
1938,PART I.,"""Loose Florence, or God will not loose thy soul!"""
1939,PART I.,Then fell back the Magnificent and died
1940,PART I.,"Beneath the star-look shooting from the cowl,"
1941,PART I.,Which turned to wormwood-bitterness the wide
1942,PART I.,Deep sea of his ambitions. It were foul
1943,PART I.,To grudge Savonarola and the rest
1944,PART I.,Their violets: rather pay them quick and fresh!
1945,PART I.,The emphasis of death makes manifest
1946,PART I.,The eloquence of action in our flesh;
1947,PART I.,"And men who, living, were but dimly guessed,"
1948,PART I.,"When once free from their life's entangled mesh,"
1949,PART I.,"Show their full length in graves, or oft indeed"
1950,PART I.,"Exaggerate their stature, in the flat,"
1951,PART I.,To noble admirations which exceed
1952,PART I.,"Most nobly, yet will calculate in that"
1953,PART I.,"But accurately. We, who are the seed"
1954,PART I.,"Of buried creatures, if we turned and spat"
1955,PART I.,"Upon our antecedents, we were vile."
1956,PART I.,Bring violets rather. If these had not walked
1957,PART I.,"Their furlong, could we hope to walk our mile?"
1958,PART I.,Therefore bring violets. Yet if we self-baulked
1959,PART I.,"Stand still, a-strewing violets all the while,"
1960,PART I.,"These moved in vain, of whom we have vainly talked."
1961,PART I.,"So rise up henceforth with a cheerful smile,"
1962,PART I.,"And having strewn the violets, reap the corn,"
1963,PART I.,"And having reaped and garnered, bring the plough"
1964,PART I.,"And draw new furrows 'neath the healthy morn,"
1965,PART I.,And plant the great Hereafter in this Now.
1966,PART I.,
1967,PART I.,"Of old 't was so. How step by step was worn,"
1968,PART I.,As each man gained on each securely!--how
1969,PART I.,"Each by his own strength sought his own Ideal,--"
1970,PART I.,The ultimate Perfection leaning bright
1971,PART I.,From out the sun and stars to bless the leal
1972,PART I.,And earnest search of all for Fair and Right
1973,PART I.,Through doubtful forms by earth accounted real!
1974,PART I.,Because old Jubal blew into delight
1975,PART I.,"The souls of men with clear-piped melodies,"
1976,PART I.,If youthful Asaph were content at most
1977,PART I.,"To draw from Jubal's grave, with listening eyes,"
1978,PART I.,Traditionary music's floating ghost
1979,PART I.,"Into the grass-grown silence, were it wise?"
1980,PART I.,"And was 't not wiser, Jubal's breath being lost,"
1981,PART I.,That Miriam clashed her cymbals to surprise
1982,PART I.,"The sun between her white arms flung apart,"
1983,PART I.,With new glad golden sounds? that David's strings
1984,PART I.,O'erflowed his hand with music from his heart?
1985,PART I.,"So harmony grows full from many springs,"
1986,PART I.,And happy accident turns holy art.
1987,PART I.,
1988,PART I.,"You enter, in your Florence wanderings,"
1989,PART I.,The church of Saint Maria Novella. Pass
1990,PART I.,"The left stair, where at plague-time Machiavel[6]"
1991,PART I.,"Saw One with set fair face as in a glass,"
1992,PART I.,"Dressed out against the fear of death and hell,"
1993,PART I.,"Rustling her silks in pauses of the mass,"
1994,PART I.,"To keep the thought off how her husband fell,"
1995,PART I.,"When she left home, stark dead across her feet,--"
1996,PART I.,The stair leads up to what the Orgagnas save
1997,PART I.,"Of Dante's dæmons; you, in passing it,"
1998,PART I.,Ascend the right stair from the farther nave
1999,PART I.,To muse in a small chapel scarcely lit
2000,PART I.,"By Cimabue's Virgin. Bright and brave,"
2001,PART I.,"That picture was accounted, mark, of old:"
2002,PART I.,"A king stood bare before its sovran grace,[7]"
2003,PART I.,A reverent people shouted to behold
2004,PART I.,"The picture, not the king, and even the place"
2005,PART I.,"Containing such a miracle grew bold,"
2006,PART I.,Named the Glad Borgo from that beauteous face
2007,PART I.,"Which thrilled the artist, after work, to think"
2008,PART I.,His own ideal Mary-smile should stand
2009,PART I.,"So very near him,--he, within the brink"
2010,PART I.,"Of all that glory, let in by his hand"
2011,PART I.,With too divine a rashness! Yet none shrink
2012,PART I.,Who come to gaze here now; albeit 't was planned
2013,PART I.,Sublimely in the thought's simplicity:
2014,PART I.,"The Lady, throned in empyreal state,"
2015,PART I.,"Minds only the young Babe upon her knee,"
2016,PART I.,"While sidelong angels bear the royal weight,"
2017,PART I.,"Prostrated meekly, smiling tenderly"
2018,PART I.,Oblivion of their wings; the Child thereat
2019,PART I.,"Stretching its hand like God. If any should,"
2020,PART I.,"Because of some stiff draperies and loose joints,"
2021,PART I.,Gaze scorn down from the heights of Raffaelhood
2022,PART I.,"On Cimabue's picture,--Heaven anoints"
2023,PART I.,"The head of no such critic, and his blood"
2024,PART I.,The poet's curse strikes full on and appoints
2025,PART I.,To ague and cold spasms for evermore.
2026,PART I.,A noble picture! worthy of the shout
2027,PART I.,Wherewith along the streets the people bore
2028,PART I.,Its cherub-faces which the sun threw out
2029,PART I.,Until they stooped and entered the church door.
2030,PART I.,"Yet rightly was young Giotto talked about,"
2031,PART I.,"Whom Cimabue found among the sheep,[8]"
2032,PART I.,"And knew, as gods know gods, and carried home"
2033,PART I.,"To paint the things he had painted, with a deep"
2034,PART I.,"And fuller insight, and so overcome"
2035,PART I.,His chapel-Lady with a heavenlier sweep
2036,PART I.,Of light: for thus we mount into the sum
2037,PART I.,"Of great things known or acted. I hold, too,"
2038,PART I.,That Cimabue smiled upon the lad
2039,PART I.,"At the first stroke which passed what he could do,"
2040,PART I.,Or else his Virgin's smile had never had
2041,PART I.,Such sweetness in 't. All great men who foreknew
2042,PART I.,"Their heirs in art, for art's sake have been glad,"
2043,PART I.,"And bent their old white heads as if uncrowned,"
2044,PART I.,Fanatics of their pure Ideals still
2045,PART I.,"Far more than of their triumphs, which were found"
2046,PART I.,With some less vehement struggle of the will.
2047,PART I.,"If old Margheritone trembled, swooned"
2048,PART I.,And died despairing at the open sill
2049,PART I.,"Of other men's achievements (who achieved,"
2050,PART I.,"By loving art beyond the master), he"
2051,PART I.,"Was old Margheritone, and conceived"
2052,PART I.,"Never, at first youth and most ecstasy,"
2053,PART I.,"A Virgin like that dream of one, which heaved"
2054,PART I.,The death-sigh from his heart. If wistfully
2055,PART I.,Margheritone sickened at the smell
2056,PART I.,"Of Cimabue's laurel, let him go!"
2057,PART I.,For Cimabue stood up very well
2058,PART I.,"In spite of Giotto's, and Angelico"
2059,PART I.,The artist-saint kept smiling in his cell
2060,PART I.,The smile with which he welcomed the sweet slow
2061,PART I.,Inbreak of angels (whitening through the dim
2062,PART I.,"That he might paint them), while the sudden sense"
2063,PART I.,Of Raffael's future was revealed to him
2064,PART I.,By force of his own fair works' competence.
2065,PART I.,The same blue waters where the dolphins swim
2066,PART I.,Suggest the tritons. Through the blue Immense
2067,PART I.,"Strike out, all swimmers! cling not in the way"
2068,PART I.,"Of one another, so to sink; but learn"
2069,PART I.,"The strong man's impulse, catch the freshening spray"
2070,PART I.,"He throws up in his motions, and discern"
2071,PART I.,"By his clear westering eye, the time of day."
2072,PART I.,"Thou, God, hast set us worthy gifts to earn"
2073,PART I.,Besides Thy heaven and Thee! and when I say
2074,PART I.,There's room here for the weakest man alive
2075,PART I.,"To live and die, there's room too, I repeat,"
2076,PART I.,"For all the strongest to live well, and strive"
2077,PART I.,"Their own way, by their individual heat,--"
2078,PART I.,"Like some new bee-swarm leaving the old hive,"
2079,PART I.,Despite the wax which tempts so violet-sweet.
2080,PART I.,"Then let the living live, the dead retain"
2081,PART I.,Their grave-cold flowers!--though honour's best supplied
2082,PART I.,"By bringing actions, to prove theirs not vain."
2083,PART I.,
2084,PART I.,"Cold graves, we say? it shall be testified"
2085,PART I.,"That living men who burn in heart and brain,"
2086,PART I.,Without the dead were colder. If we tried
2087,PART I.,"To sink the past beneath our feet, be sure"
2088,PART I.,The future would not stand. Precipitate
2089,PART I.,"This old roof from the shrine, and, insecure,"
2090,PART I.,"The nesting swallows fly off, mate from mate."
2091,PART I.,"How scant the gardens, if the graves were fewer!"
2092,PART I.,The tall green poplars grew no longer straight
2093,PART I.,Whose tops not looked to Troy. Would any fight
2094,PART I.,"For Athens, and not swear by Marathon?"
2095,PART I.,"Who dared build temples, without tombs in sight?"
2096,PART I.,"Or live, without some dead man's benison?"
2097,PART I.,"Or seek truth, hope for good, and strive for right,"
2098,PART I.,"If, looking up, he saw not in the sun"
2099,PART I.,Some angel of the martyrs all day long
2100,PART I.,Standing and waiting? Your last rhythm will need
2101,PART I.,"Your earliest key-note. Could I sing this song,"
2102,PART I.,If my dead masters had not taken heed
2103,PART I.,"To help the heavens and earth to make me strong,"
2104,PART I.,As the wind ever will find out some reed
2105,PART I.,And touch it to such issues as belong
2106,PART I.,To such a frail thing? None may grudge the Dead
2107,PART I.,Libations from full cups. Unless we choose
2108,PART I.,"To look back to the hills behind us spread,"
2109,PART I.,The plains before us sadden and confuse;
2110,PART I.,"If orphaned, we are disinherited."
2111,PART I.,
2112,PART I.,"I would but turn these lachrymals to use,"
2113,PART I.,"And pour fresh oil in from the olive-grove,"
2114,PART I.,To furnish them as new lamps. Shall I say
2115,PART I.,What made my heart beat with exulting love
2116,PART I.,A few weeks back?--
2117,PART I.,The day was such a day
2118,PART I.,"As Florence owes the sun. The sky above,"
2119,PART I.,"Its weight upon the mountains seemed to lay,"
2120,PART I.,"And palpitate in glory, like a dove"
2121,PART I.,"Who has flown too fast, full-hearted--take away"
2122,PART I.,The image! for the heart of man beat higher
2123,PART I.,"That day in Florence, flooding all her streets"
2124,PART I.,And piazzas with a tumult and desire.
2125,PART I.,"The people, with accumulated heats"
2126,PART I.,"And faces turned one way, as if one fire"
2127,PART I.,"Both drew and flushed them, left their ancient beats"
2128,PART I.,And went up toward the palace-Pitti wall
2129,PART I.,"To thank their Grand-duke who, not quite of course,"
2130,PART I.,"Had graciously permitted, at their call,"
2131,PART I.,The citizens to use their civic force
2132,PART I.,"To guard their civic homes. So, one and all,"
2133,PART I.,The Tuscan cities streamed up to the source
2134,PART I.,"Of this new good at Florence, taking it"
2135,PART I.,"As good so far, presageful of more good,--"
2136,PART I.,"The first torch of Italian freedom, lit"
2137,PART I.,To toss in the next tiger's face who should
2138,PART I.,"Approach too near them in a greedy fit,--"
2139,PART I.,The first pulse of an even flow of blood
2140,PART I.,To prove the level of Italian veins
2141,PART I.,Towards rights perceived and granted. How we gazed
2142,PART I.,"From Casa Guidi windows while, in trains"
2143,PART I.,"Of orderly procession--banners raised,"
2144,PART I.,And intermittent bursts of martial strains
2145,PART I.,"Which died upon the shout, as if amazed"
2146,PART I.,By gladness beyond music--they passed on!
2147,PART I.,"The Magistracy, with insignia, passed,--"
2148,PART I.,"And all the people shouted in the sun,"
2149,PART I.,And all the thousand windows which had cast
2150,PART I.,A ripple of silks in blue and scarlet down
2151,PART I.,"(As if the houses overflowed at last),"
2152,PART I.,Seemed growing larger with fair heads and eyes.
2153,PART I.,"The Lawyers passed,--and still arose the shout,"
2154,PART I.,And hands broke from the windows to surprise
2155,PART I.,Those grave calm brows with bay-tree leaves thrown out.
2156,PART I.,"The Priesthood passed,--the friars with worldly-wise"
2157,PART I.,Keen sidelong glances from their beards about
2158,PART I.,The street to see who shouted; many a monk
2159,PART I.,"Who takes a long rope in the waist, was there:"
2160,PART I.,Whereat the popular exultation drunk
2161,PART I.,"With indrawn ""vivas"" the whole sunny air,"
2162,PART I.,While through the murmuring windows rose and sunk
2163,PART I.,"A cloud of kerchiefed hands,--""The church makes fair"
2164,PART I.,"Her welcome in the new Pope's name."" Ensued"
2165,PART I.,"The black sign of the ""Martyrs""--(name no name,"
2166,PART I.,But count the graves in silence). Next were viewed
2167,PART I.,"The Artists; next, the Trades; and after came"
2168,PART I.,"The People,--flag and sign, and rights as good--"
2169,PART I.,And very loud the shout was for that same
2170,PART I.,"Motto, ""Il popolo."" IL POPOLO,--"
2171,PART I.,"The word means dukedom, empire, majesty,"
2172,PART I.,And kings in such an hour might read it so.
2173,PART I.,"And next, with banners, each in his degree,"
2174,PART I.,Deputed representatives a-row
2175,PART I.,Of every separate state of Tuscany:
2176,PART I.,"Siena's she-wolf, bristling on the fold"
2177,PART I.,"Of the first flag, preceded Pisa's hare,"
2178,PART I.,"And Massa's lion floated calm in gold,"
2179,PART I.,"Pienza's following with his silver stare,"
2180,PART I.,"Arezzo's steed pranced clear from bridle-hold,--"
2181,PART I.,"And well might shout our Florence, greeting there"
2182,PART I.,"These, and more brethren. Last, the world had sent"
2183,PART I.,The various children of her teeming flanks--
2184,PART I.,"Greeks, English, French--as if to a parliament"
2185,PART I.,"Of lovers of her Italy in ranks,"
2186,PART I.,Each bearing its land's symbol reverent;
2187,PART I.,At which the stones seemed breaking into thanks
2188,PART I.,"And rattling up the sky, such sounds in proof"
2189,PART I.,Arose; the very house-walls seemed to bend;
2190,PART I.,"The very windows, up from door to roof,"
2191,PART I.,"Flashed out a rapture of bright heads, to mend"
2192,PART I.,With passionate looks the gesture's whirling off
2193,PART I.,A hurricane of leaves. Three hours did end
2194,PART I.,"While all these passed; and ever in the crowd,"
2195,PART I.,"Rude men, unconscious of the tears that kept"
2196,PART I.,"Their beards moist, shouted; some few laughed aloud,"
2197,PART I.,And none asked any why they laughed and wept:
2198,PART I.,"Friends kissed each other's cheeks, and foes long vowed"
2199,PART I.,More warmly did it; two-months' babies leapt
2200,PART I.,"Right upward in their mother's arms, whose black"
2201,PART I.,Wide glittering eyes looked elsewhere; lovers pressed
2202,PART I.,"Each before either, neither glancing back;"
2203,PART I.,And peasant maidens smoothly 'tired and tressed
2204,PART I.,Forgot to finger on their throats the slack
2205,PART I.,"Great pearl-strings; while old blind men would not rest,"
2206,PART I.,But pattered with their staves and slid their shoes
2207,PART I.,"Along the stones, and smiled as if they saw."
2208,PART I.,"O heaven, I think that day had noble use"
2209,PART I.,"Among God's days! So near stood Right and Law,"
2210,PART I.,Both mutually forborne! Law would not bruise
2211,PART I.,"Nor Right deny, and each in reverent awe"
2212,PART I.,"Honoured the other. And if, ne'ertheless,"
2213,PART I.,That good day's sun delivered to the vines
2214,PART I.,"No charta, and the liberal Duke's excess"
2215,PART I.,Did scarce exceed a Guelf's or Ghibelline's
2216,PART I.,In any special actual righteousness
2217,PART I.,"Of what that day he granted, still the signs"
2218,PART I.,"Are good and full of promise, we must say,"
2219,PART I.,When multitudes approach their kings with prayers
2220,PART I.,And kings concede their people's right to pray
2221,PART I.,"Both in one sunshine. Griefs are not despairs,"
2222,PART I.,"So uttered, nor can royal claims dismay"
2223,PART I.,When men from humble homes and ducal chairs
2224,PART I.,Hate wrong together. It was well to view
2225,PART I.,Those banners ruffled in a ruler's face
2226,PART I.,"Inscribed, ""Live freedom, union, and all true"
2227,PART I.,"Brave patriots who are aided by God's grace!"""
2228,PART I.,Nor was it ill when Leopoldo drew
2229,PART I.,His little children to the window-place
2230,PART I.,"He stood in at the Pitti, to suggest"
2231,PART I.,_They_ too should govern as the people willed.
2232,PART I.,"What a cry rose then! some, who saw the best,"
2233,PART I.,Declared his eyes filled up and overfilled
2234,PART I.,With good warm human tears which unrepressed
2235,PART I.,Ran down. I like his face; the forehead's build
2236,PART I.,"Has no capacious genius, yet perhaps"
2237,PART I.,"Sufficient comprehension,--mild and sad,"
2238,PART I.,"And careful nobly,--not with care that wraps"
2239,PART I.,"Self-loving hearts, to stifle and make mad,"
2240,PART I.,But careful with the care that shuns a lapse
2241,PART I.,"Of faith and duty, studious not to add"
2242,PART I.,A burden in the gathering of a gain.
2243,PART I.,"And so, God save the Duke, I say with those"
2244,PART I.,"Who that day shouted it; and while dukes reign,"
2245,PART I.,May all wear in the visible overflows
2246,PART I.,"Of spirit, such a look of careful pain!"
2247,PART I.,For God must love it better than repose.
2248,PART I.,
2249,PART I.,And all the people who went up to let
2250,PART I.,"Their hearts out to that Duke, as has been told--"
2251,PART I.,"Where guess ye that the living people met,"
2252,PART I.,"Kept tryst, formed ranks, chose leaders, first unrolled"
2253,PART I.,Their banners?
2254,PART I.,In the Loggia? where is set
2255,PART I.,"Cellini's godlike Perseus, bronze or gold,"
2256,PART I.,"(How name the metal, when the statue flings"
2257,PART I.,Its soul so in your eyes?) with brow and sword
2258,PART I.,"Superbly calm, as all opposing things,"
2259,PART I.,"Slain with the Gorgon, were no more abhorred"
2260,PART I.,Since ended?
2261,PART I.,"No, the people sought no wings"
2262,PART I.,"From Perseus in the Loggia, nor implored"
2263,PART I.,An inspiration in the place beside
2264,PART I.,"From that dim bust of Brutus, jagged and grand,"
2265,PART I.,Where Buonarroti passionately tried
2266,PART I.,From out the close-clenched marble to demand
2267,PART I.,"The head of Rome's sublimest homicide,"
2268,PART I.,"Then dropt the quivering mallet from his hand,"
2269,PART I.,Despairing he could find no model-stuff
2270,PART I.,Of Brutus in all Florence where he found
2271,PART I.,The gods and gladiators thick enough.
2272,PART I.,Nor there! the people chose still holier ground:
2273,PART I.,"The people, who are simple, blind and rough,"
2274,PART I.,"Know their own angels, after looking round."
2275,PART I.,Whom chose they then? where met they?
2276,PART I.,
2277,PART I.,On the stone
2278,PART I.,"Called Dante's,--a plain flat stone scarce discerned"
2279,PART I.,"From others in the pavement,--whereupon"
2280,PART I.,"He used to bring his quiet chair out, turned"
2281,PART I.,"To Brunelleschi's church, and pour alone"
2282,PART I.,The lava of his spirit when it burned:
2283,PART I.,It is not cold to-day. O passionate
2284,PART I.,"Poor Dante who, a banished Florentine,"
2285,PART I.,Didst sit austere at banquets of the great
2286,PART I.,And muse upon this far-off stone of thine
2287,PART I.,And think how oft some passer used to wait
2288,PART I.,"A moment, in the golden day's decline,"
2289,PART I.,"With ""Good night, dearest Dante!""--well, good night!"
2290,PART I.,"_I_ muse now, Dante, and think verily,"
2291,PART I.,"Though chapelled in the byeway out of sight,"
2292,PART I.,"Ravenna's bones would thrill with ecstasy,"
2293,PART I.,Couldst know thy favourite stone's elected right
2294,PART I.,As tryst-place for thy Tuscans to foresee
2295,PART I.,"Their earliest chartas from. Good night, good morn,"
2296,PART I.,"Henceforward, Dante! now my soul is sure"
2297,PART I.,"That thine is better comforted of scorn,"
2298,PART I.,And looks down earthward in completer cure
2299,PART I.,"Than when, in Santa Croce church forlorn"
2300,PART I.,"Of any corpse, the architect and hewer"
2301,PART I.,Did pile the empty marbles as thy tomb.[9]
2302,PART I.,"For now thou art no longer exiled, now"
2303,PART I.,Best honoured: we salute thee who art come
2304,PART I.,Back to the old stone with a softer brow
2305,PART I.,"Than Giotto drew upon the wall, for some"
2306,PART I.,Good lovers of our age to track and plough[10]
2307,PART I.,"Their way to, through time's ordures stratified,"
2308,PART I.,And startle broad awake into the dull
2309,PART I.,"Bargello chamber: now thou'rt milder-eyed,--"
2310,PART I.,Now Beatrix may leap up glad to cull
2311,PART I.,"Thy first smile, even in heaven and at her side,"
2312,PART I.,"Like that which, nine years old, looked beautiful"
2313,PART I.,At May-game. What do I say? I only meant
2314,PART I.,"That tender Dante loved his Florence well,"
2315,PART I.,"While Florence, now, to love him is content;"
2316,PART I.,"And, mark ye, that the piercingest sweet smell"
2317,PART I.,Of love's dear incense by the living sent
2318,PART I.,"To find the dead, is not accessible"
2319,PART I.,"To lazy livers--no narcotic,--not"
2320,PART I.,"Swung in a censer to a sleepy tune,--"
2321,PART I.,But trod out in the morning air by hot
2322,PART I.,"Quick spirits who tread firm to ends foreshown,"
2323,PART I.,"And use the name of greatness unforgot,"
2324,PART I.,To meditate what greatness may be done.
2325,PART I.,
2326,PART I.,"For Dante sits in heaven and ye stand here,"
2327,PART I.,"And more remains for doing, all must feel,"
2328,PART I.,Than trysting on his stone from year to year
2329,PART I.,"To shift processions, civic toe to heel,"
2330,PART I.,The town's thanks to the Pitti. Are ye freer
2331,PART I.,For what was felt that day? a chariot-wheel
2332,PART I.,"May spin fast, yet the chariot never roll."
2333,PART I.,"But if that day suggested something good,"
2334,PART I.,"And bettered, with one purpose, soul by soul,--"
2335,PART I.,Better means freer. A land's brotherhood
2336,PART I.,"Is most puissant: men, upon the whole,"
2337,PART I.,"Are what they can be,--nations, what they would."
2338,PART I.,
2339,PART I.,"Will therefore, to be strong, thou Italy!"
2340,PART I.,Will to be noble! Austrian Metternich
2341,PART I.,Can fix no yoke unless the neck agree;
2342,PART I.,And thine is like the lion's when the thick
2343,PART I.,"Dews shudder from it, and no man would be"
2344,PART I.,"The stroker of his mane, much less would prick"
2345,PART I.,His nostril with a reed. When nations roar
2346,PART I.,"Like lions, who shall tame them and defraud"
2347,PART I.,Of the due pasture by the river-shore?
2348,PART I.,"Roar, therefore! shake your dewlaps dry abroad:"
2349,PART I.,The amphitheatre with open door
2350,PART I.,Leads back upon the benches who applaud
2351,PART I.,The last spear-thruster.
2352,PART I.,
2353,PART I.,Yet the Heavens forbid
2354,PART I.,That we should call on passion to confront
2355,PART I.,"The brutal with the brutal and, amid"
2356,PART I.,"This ripening world, suggest a lion-hunt"
2357,PART I.,And lion's-vengeance for the wrongs men did
2358,PART I.,"And do now, though the spears are getting blunt."
2359,PART I.,"We only call, because the sight and proof"
2360,PART I.,Of lion-strength hurts nothing; and to show
2361,PART I.,"A lion-heart, and measure paw with hoof,"
2362,PART I.,"Helps something, even, and will instruct a foe"
2363,PART I.,"As well as the onslaught, how to stand aloof:"
2364,PART I.,Or else the world gets past the mere brute blow
2365,PART I.,Or given or taken. Children use the fist
2366,PART I.,Until they are of age to use the brain;
2367,PART I.,And so we needed Cæsars to assist
2368,PART I.,"Man's justice, and Napoleons to explain"
2369,PART I.,"God's counsel, when a point was nearly missed,"
2370,PART I.,Until our generations should attain
2371,PART I.,"Christ's stature nearer. Not that we, alas,"
2372,PART I.,Attain already; but a single inch
2373,PART I.,Will raise to look down on the swordsman's pass.
2374,PART I.,As knightly Roland on the coward's flinch:
2375,PART I.,"And, after chloroform and ether-gas,"
2376,PART I.,We find out slowly what the bee and finch
2377,PART I.,"Have ready found, through Nature's lamp in each,"
2378,PART I.,How to our races we may justify
2379,PART I.,"Our individual claims and, as we reach"
2380,PART I.,"Our own grapes, bend the top vines to supply"
2381,PART I.,"The children's uses,--how to fill a breach"
2382,PART I.,"With olive-branches,--how to quench a lie"
2383,PART I.,"With truth, and smite a foe upon the cheek"
2384,PART I.,"With Christ's most conquering kiss. Why, these are things"
2385,PART I.,"Worth a great nation's finding, to prove weak"
2386,PART I.,"The ""glorious arms"" of military kings."
2387,PART I.,"And so with wide embrace, my England, seek"
2388,PART I.,To stifle the bad heat and flickerings
2389,PART I.,Of this world's false and nearly expended fire!
2390,PART I.,"Draw palpitating arrows to the wood,"
2391,PART I.,And twang abroad thy high hopes and thy higher
2392,PART I.,"Resolves, from that most virtuous altitude!"
2393,PART I.,Till nations shall unconsciously aspire
2394,PART I.,"By looking up to thee, and learn that good"
2395,PART I.,And glory are not different. Announce law
2396,PART I.,By freedom; exalt chivalry by peace;
2397,PART I.,"Instruct how clear calm eyes can overawe,"
2398,PART I.,"And how pure hands, stretched simply to release"
2399,PART I.,"A bond-slave, will not need a sword to draw"
2400,PART I.,"To be held dreadful. O my England, crease"
2401,PART I.,"Thy purple with no alien agonies,"
2402,PART I.,"No struggles toward encroachment, no vile war!"
2403,PART I.,"Disband thy captains, change thy victories,"
2404,PART I.,"Be henceforth prosperous as the angels are,"
2405,PART I.,"Helping, not humbling."
2406,PART I.,
2407,PART I.,Drums and battle-cries
2408,PART I.,Go out in music of the morning-star--
2409,PART I.,And soon we shall have thinkers in the place
2410,PART I.,"Of fighters, each found able as a man"
2411,PART I.,"To strike electric influence through a race,"
2412,PART I.,Unstayed by city-wall and barbican.
2413,PART I.,The poet shall look grander in the face
2414,PART I.,Than even of old (when he of Greece began
2415,PART I.,"To sing ""that Achillean wrath which slew"
2416,PART I.,"So many heroes"")--seeing he shall treat"
2417,PART I.,"The deeds of souls heroic toward the true,"
2418,PART I.,"The oracles of life, previsions sweet"
2419,PART I.,And awful like divine swans gliding through
2420,PART I.,"White arms of Ledas, which will leave the heat"
2421,PART I.,Of their escaping godship to endue
2422,PART I.,The human medium with a heavenly flush.
2423,PART I.,
2424,PART I.,"Meanwhile, in this same Italy we want"
2425,PART I.,"Not popular passion, to arise and crush,"
2426,PART I.,"But popular conscience, which may covenant"
2427,PART I.,"For what it knows. Concede without a blush,"
2428,PART I.,"To grant the ""civic guard"" is not to grant"
2429,PART I.,"The civic spirit, living and awake:"
2430,PART I.,"Those lappets on your shoulders, citizens,"
2431,PART I.,Your eyes strain after sideways till they ache
2432,PART I.,"(While still, in admirations and amens,"
2433,PART I.,The crowd comes up on festa-days to take
2434,PART I.,"The great sight in)--are not intelligence,"
2435,PART I.,"Not courage even--alas, if not the sign"
2436,PART I.,"Of something very noble, they are nought;"
2437,PART I.,For every day ye dress your sallow kine
2438,PART I.,"With fringes down their cheeks, though unbesought"
2439,PART I.,They loll their heavy heads and drag the wine
2440,PART I.,And bear the wooden yoke as they were taught
2441,PART I.,The first day. What ye want is light--indeed
2442,PART I.,Not sunlight--(ye may well look up surprised
2443,PART I.,To those unfathomable heavens that feed
2444,PART I.,Your purple hills)--but God's light organized
2445,PART I.,"In some high soul, crowned capable to lead"
2446,PART I.,"The conscious people, conscious and advised,--"
2447,PART I.,"For if we lift a people like mere clay,"
2448,PART I.,"It falls the same. We want thee, O unfound"
2449,PART I.,And sovran teacher! if thy beard be grey
2450,PART I.,"Or black, we bid thee rise up from the ground"
2451,PART I.,"And speak the word God giveth thee to say,"
2452,PART I.,"Inspiring into all this people round,"
2453,PART I.,"Instead of passion, thought, which pioneers"
2454,PART I.,"All generous passion, purifies from sin,"
2455,PART I.,"And strikes the hour for. Rise up, teacher! here's"
2456,PART I.,A crowd to make a nation!--best begin
2457,PART I.,"By making each a man, till all be peers"
2458,PART I.,Of earth's true patriots and pure martyrs in
2459,PART I.,Knowing and daring. Best unbar the doors
2460,PART I.,Which Peter's heirs keep locked so overclose
2461,PART I.,"They only let the mice across the floors,"
2462,PART I.,"While every churchman dangles, as he goes,"
2463,PART I.,"The great key at his girdle, and abhors"
2464,PART I.,"In Christ's name, meekly. Open wide the house,"
2465,PART I.,"Concede the entrance with Christ's liberal mind,"
2466,PART I.,And set the tables with His wine and bread.
2467,PART I.,"What! ""commune in both kinds?"" In every kind--"
2468,PART I.,"Wine, wafer, love, hope, truth, unlimited,"
2469,PART I.,Nothing kept back. For when a man is blind
2470,PART I.,"To starlight, will he see the rose is red?"
2471,PART I.,A bondsman shivering at a Jesuit's foot--
2472,PART I.,"""Væ! meâ culpâ!""--is not like to stand"
2473,PART I.,A freedman at a despot's and dispute
2474,PART I.,"His titles by the balance in his hand,"
2475,PART I.,"Weighing them ""suo jure."" Tend the root"
2476,PART I.,"If careful of the branches, and expand"
2477,PART I.,The inner souls of men before you strive
2478,PART I.,For civic heroes.
2479,PART I.,
2480,PART I.,"But the teacher, where?"
2481,PART I.,"From all these crowded faces, all alive,"
2482,PART I.,"Eyes, of their own lids flashing themselves bare,"
2483,PART I.,And brows that with a mobile life contrive
2484,PART I.,"A deeper shadow,--may we in no wise dare"
2485,PART I.,"To put a finger out and touch a man,"
2486,PART I.,"And cry ""this is the leader""? What, all these!"
2487,PART I.,"Broad heads, black eyes,--yet not a soul that ran"
2488,PART I.,"From God down with a message? All, to please"
2489,PART I.,"The donna waving measures with her fan,"
2490,PART I.,And not the judgment-angel on his knees
2491,PART I.,"(The trumpet just an inch off from his lips),"
2492,PART I.,"Who when he breathes next, will put out the sun?"
2493,PART I.,
2494,PART I.,"Yet mankind's self were foundered in eclipse,"
2495,PART I.,"If lacking doers, with great works to be done;"
2496,PART I.,"And lo, the startled earth already dips"
2497,PART I.,Back into light; a better day's begun;
2498,PART I.,"And soon this leader, teacher, will stand plain,"
2499,PART I.,And build the golden pipes and synthesize
2500,PART I.,This people-organ for a holy strain.
2501,PART I.,"We hold this hope, and still in all these eyes"
2502,PART I.,Go sounding for the deep look which shall drain
2503,PART I.,Suffused thought into channelled enterprise.
2504,PART I.,"Where is the teacher? What now may he do,"
2505,PART I.,Who shall do greatly? Doth he gird his waist
2506,PART I.,"With a monk's rope, like Luther? or pursue"
2507,PART I.,"The goat, like Tell? or dry his nets in haste,"
2508,PART I.,Like Masaniello when the sky was blue?
2509,PART I.,"Keep house, like other peasants, with inlaced"
2510,PART I.,"Bare brawny arms about a favourite child,"
2511,PART I.,And meditative looks beyond the door
2512,PART I.,(But not to mark the kidling's teeth have filed
2513,PART I.,The green shoots of his vine which last year bore
2514,PART I.,"Full twenty bunches), or, on triple-piled"
2515,PART I.,"Throne-velvets sit at ease to bless the poor,"
2516,PART I.,"Like other pontiffs, in the Poorest's name?"
2517,PART I.,The old tiara keeps itself aslope
2518,PART I.,"Upon his steady brows which, all the same,"
2519,PART I.,Bend mildly to permit the people's hope?
2520,PART I.,
2521,PART I.,"Whatever hand shall grasp this oriflamme,"
2522,PART I.,Whatever man (last peasant or first pope
2523,PART I.,"Seeking to free his country) shall appear,"
2524,PART I.,"Teach, lead, strike fire into the masses, fill"
2525,PART I.,"These empty bladders with fine air, insphere"
2526,PART I.,"These wills into a unity of will,"
2527,PART I.,And make of Italy a nation--dear
2528,PART I.,And blessed be that man! the Heavens shall kill
2529,PART I.,"No leaf the earth lets grow for him, and Death"
2530,PART I.,Shall cast him back upon the lap of Life
2531,PART I.,"To live more surely, in a clarion-breath"
2532,PART I.,"Of hero-music. Brutus with the knife,"
2533,PART I.,"Rienzi with the fasces, throb beneath"
2534,PART I.,"Rome's stones,--and more who threw away joy's fife"
2535,PART I.,"Like Pallas, that the beauty of their souls"
2536,PART I.,Might ever shine untroubled and entire:
2537,PART I.,But if it can be true that he who rolls
2538,PART I.,The Church's thunders will reserve her fire
2539,PART I.,"For only light,--from eucharistic bowls"
2540,PART I.,"Will pour new life for nations that expire,"
2541,PART I.,And rend the scarlet of his papal vest
2542,PART I.,"To gird the weak loins of his countrymen,--"
2543,PART I.,I hold that he surpasses all the rest
2544,PART I.,"Of Romans, heroes, patriots; and that when"
2545,PART I.,"He sat down on the throne, he dispossessed"
2546,PART I.,"The first graves of some glory. See again,"
2547,PART I.,This country-saving is a glorious thing:
2548,PART I.,And if a common man achieved it? well.
2549,PART I.,"Say, a rich man did? excellent. A king?"
2550,PART I.,That grows sublime. A priest? improbable.
2551,PART I.,"A pope? Ah, there we stop, and cannot bring"
2552,PART I.,"Our faith up to the leap, with history's bell"
2553,PART I.,So heavy round the neck of it--albeit
2554,PART I.,We fain would grant the possibility
2555,PART I.,"For _thy_ sake, Pio Nono!"
2556,PART I.,
2557,PART I.,Stretch thy feet
2558,PART I.,In that case--I will kiss them reverently
2559,PART I.,As any pilgrim to the papal seat:
2560,PART I.,"And, such proved possible, thy throne to me"
2561,PART I.,Shall seem as holy a place as Pellico's
2562,PART I.,"Venetian dungeon, or as Spielberg's grate"
2563,PART I.,At which the Lombard woman hung the rose
2564,PART I.,"Of her sweet soul by its own dewy weight,"
2565,PART I.,"To feel the dungeon round her sunshine close,"
2566,PART I.,"And pining so, died early, yet too late"
2567,PART I.,"For what she suffered. Yea, I will not choose"
2568,PART I.,"Betwixt thy throne, Pope Pius, and the spot"
2569,PART I.,"Marked red for ever, spite of rains and dews,"
2570,PART I.,"Where Two fell riddled by the Austrian's shot,"
2571,PART I.,"The brothers Bandiera, who accuse,"
2572,PART I.,With one same mother-voice and face (that what
2573,PART I.,They speak may be invincible) the sins
2574,PART I.,"Of earth's tormentors before God the just,"
2575,PART I.,Until the unconscious thunderbolt begins
2576,PART I.,To loosen in His grasp.
2577,PART I.,
2578,PART I.,And yet we must
2579,PART I.,"Beware, and mark the natural kiths and kins"
2580,PART I.,"Of circumstance and office, and distrust"
2581,PART I.,"The rich man reasoning in a poor man's hut,"
2582,PART I.,The poet who neglects pure truth to prove
2583,PART I.,"Statistic fact, the child who leaves a rut"
2584,PART I.,"For a smoother road, the priest who vows his glove"
2585,PART I.,"Exhales no grace, the prince who walks afoot,"
2586,PART I.,"The woman who has sworn she will not love,"
2587,PART I.,"And this Ninth Pius in Seventh Gregory's chair,"
2588,PART I.,With Andrea Doria's forehead!
2589,PART I.,
2590,PART I.,Count what goes
2591,PART I.,"To making up a pope, before he wear"
2592,PART I.,That triple crown. We pass the world-wide throes
2593,PART I.,"Which went to make the popedom,--the despair"
2594,PART I.,"Of free men, good men, wise men; the dread shows"
2595,PART I.,"Of women's faces, by the faggot's flash"
2596,PART I.,"Tossed out, to the minutest stir and throb"
2597,PART I.,"O' the white lips, the least tremble of a lash,"
2598,PART I.,To glut the red stare of a licensed mob;
2599,PART I.,"The short mad cries down oubliettes, and plash"
2600,PART I.,"So horribly far off; priests, trained to rob,"
2601,PART I.,"And kings that, like encouraged nightmares, sat"
2602,PART I.,On nations' hearts most heavily distressed
2603,PART I.,With monstrous sights and apophthegms of fate--
2604,PART I.,"We pass these things,--because ""the times"" are prest"
2605,PART I.,With necessary charges of the weight
2606,PART I.,"Of all this sin, and ""Calvin, for the rest,"

2999,PART II.,"To the roots of thunder, if we kneel and sue?"
3000,PART II.,
3001,PART II.,"From Casa Guidi windows I looked forth,"
3002,PART II.,And saw ten thousand eyes of Florentines
3003,PART II.,"Flash back the triumph of the Lombard north,--"
3004,PART II.,"Saw fifty banners, freighted with the signs"
3005,PART II.,"And exultations of the awakened earth,"
3006,PART II.,"Float on above the multitude in lines,"
3007,PART II.,"Straight to the Pitti. So, the vision went."
3008,PART II.,"And so, between those populous rough hands"
3009,PART II.,"Raised in the sun, Duke Leopold outleant,"
3010,PART II.,And took the patriot's oath which henceforth stands
3011,PART II.,"Among the oaths of perjurers, eminent"
3012,PART II.,To catch the lightnings ripened for these lands.
3013,PART II.,
3014,PART II.,"Why swear at all, thou false Duke Leopold?"
3015,PART II.,What need to swear? What need to boast thy blood
3016,PART II.,"Unspoilt of Austria, and thy heart unsold"
3017,PART II.,Away from Florence? It was understood
3018,PART II.,God made thee not too vigorous or too bold;
3019,PART II.,"And men had patience with thy quiet mood,"
3020,PART II.,"And women, pity, as they saw thee pace"
3021,PART II.,Their festive streets with premature grey hairs.
3022,PART II.,We turned the mild dejection of thy face
3023,PART II.,"To princely meanings, took thy wrinkling cares"
3024,PART II.,"For ruffling hopes, and called thee weak, not base."
3025,PART II.,"Nay, better light the torches for more prayers"
3026,PART II.,"And smoke the pale Madonnas at the shrine,"
3027,PART II.,"Being still ""our poor Grand-duke, our good Grand-duke,"
3028,PART II.,"Who cannot help the Austrian in his line,""--"
3029,PART II.,Than write an oath upon a nation's book
3030,PART II.,For men to spit at with scorn's blurring brine!
3031,PART II.,Who dares forgive what none can overlook?
3032,PART II.,
3033,PART II.,"For me, I do repent me in this dust"
3034,PART II.,"Of towns and temples which makes Italy,--"
3035,PART II.,I sigh amid the sighs which breathe a gust
3036,PART II.,Of dying century to century
3037,PART II.,Around us on the uneven crater-crust
3038,PART II.,"Of these old worlds,--I bow my soul and knee."
3039,PART II.,"Absolve me, patriots, of my woman's fault"
3040,PART II.,That ever I believed the man was true!
3041,PART II.,"These sceptred strangers shun the common salt,"
3042,PART II.,"And, therefore, when the general board's in view"
3043,PART II.,"And they stand up to carve for blind and halt,"
3044,PART II.,The wise suspect the viands which ensue.
3045,PART II.,"I much repent that, in this time and place"
3046,PART II.,Where many corpse-lights of experience burn
3047,PART II.,"From Cæsar's and Lorenzo's festering race,"
3048,PART II.,"To enlighten groping reasoners, I could learn"
3049,PART II.,No better counsel for a simple case
3050,PART II.,"Than to put faith in princes, in my turn."
3051,PART II.,Had all the death-piles of the ancient years
3052,PART II.,Flared up in vain before me? knew I not
3053,PART II.,What stench arises from some purple gears?
3054,PART II.,And how the sceptres witness whence they got
3055,PART II.,"Their briar-wood, crackling through the atmosphere's"
3056,PART II.,"Foul smoke, by princely perjuries, kept hot?"
3057,PART II.,"Forgive me, ghosts of patriots,--Brutus, thou,"
3058,PART II.,Who trailest downhill into life again
3059,PART II.,"Thy blood-weighed cloak, to indict me with thy slow"
3060,PART II.,Reproachful eyes!--for being taught in vain
3061,PART II.,"That, while the illegitimate Cæsars show"
3062,PART II.,Of meaner stature than the first full strain
3063,PART II.,"(Confessed incompetent to conquer Gaul),"
3064,PART II.,They swoon as feebly and cross Rubicons
3065,PART II.,As rashly as any Julius of them all!
3066,PART II.,"Forgive, that I forgot the mind which runs"
3067,PART II.,"Through absolute races, too unsceptical!"
3068,PART II.,"I saw the man among his little sons,"
3069,PART II.,His lips were warm with kisses while he swore;
3070,PART II.,"And I, because I am a woman--I,"
3071,PART II.,Who felt my own child's coming life before
3072,PART II.,"The prescience of my soul, and held faith high,--"
3073,PART II.,"I could not bear to think, whoever bore,"
3074,PART II.,"That lips, so warmed, could shape so cold a lie."
3075,PART II.,
3076,PART II.,"From Casa Guidi windows I looked out,"
3077,PART II.,"Again looked, and beheld a different sight."
3078,PART II.,The Duke had fled before the people's shout
3079,PART II.,"""Long live the Duke!"" A people, to speak right,"
3080,PART II.,"Must speak as soft as courtiers, lest a doubt"
3081,PART II.,"Should curdle brows of gracious sovereigns, white."
3082,PART II.,Moreover that same dangerous shouting meant
3083,PART II.,"Some gratitude for future favours, which"
3084,PART II.,"Were only promised, the Constituent"
3085,PART II.,"Implied, the whole being subject to the hitch"
3086,PART II.,"In ""motu proprios,"" very incident"
3087,PART II.,"To all these Czars, from Paul to Paulovitch."
3088,PART II.,Whereat the people rose up in the dust
3089,PART II.,"Of the ruler's flying feet, and shouted still"
3090,PART II.,"And loudly; only, this time, as was just,"
3091,PART II.,"Not ""Live the Duke,"" who had fled for good or ill,"
3092,PART II.,"But ""Live the People,"" who remained and must,"
3093,PART II.,The unrenounced and unrenounceable.
3094,PART II.,Long live the people! How they lived! and boiled
3095,PART II.,And bubbled in the cauldron of the street:
3096,PART II.,"How the young blustered, nor the old recoiled,"
3097,PART II.,And what a thunderous stir of tongues and feet
3098,PART II.,Trod flat the palpitating bells and foiled
3099,PART II.,"The joy-guns of their echo, shattering it!"
3100,PART II.,How down they pulled the Duke's arms everywhere!
3101,PART II.,"How up they set new café-signs, to show"
3102,PART II.,Where patriots might sip ices in pure air--
3103,PART II.,(The fresh paint smelling somewhat)! To and fro
3104,PART II.,"How marched the civic guard, and stopped to stare"
3105,PART II.,When boys broke windows in a civic glow!
3106,PART II.,"How rebel songs were sung to loyal tunes,"
3107,PART II.,And bishops cursed in ecclesiastic metres:
3108,PART II.,"How all the Circoli grew large as moons,"
3109,PART II.,"And all the speakers, moonstruck,--thankful greeters"
3110,PART II.,"Of prospects which struck poor the ducal boons,"
3111,PART II.,"A mere free Press, and Chambers!--frank repeaters"
3112,PART II.,"Of great Guerazzi's praises--""There's a man,"
3113,PART II.,"The father of the land, who, truly great,"
3114,PART II.,"Takes off that national disgrace and ban,"
3115,PART II.,"The farthing tax upon our Florence-gate,"
3116,PART II.,"And saves Italia as he only can!"""
3117,PART II.,"How all the nobles fled, and would not wait,"
3118,PART II.,"Because they were most noble,--which being so,"
3119,PART II.,"How Liberals vowed to burn their palaces,"
3120,PART II.,Because free Tuscans were not free to go!
3121,PART II.,"How grown men raged at Austria's wickedness,"
3122,PART II.,"And smoked,--while fifty striplings in a row"
3123,PART II.,Marched straight to Piedmont for the wrong's redress!
3124,PART II.,"You say we failed in duty, we who wore"
3125,PART II.,"Black velvet like Italian democrats,"
3126,PART II.,"Who slashed our sleeves like patriots, nor forswore"
3127,PART II.,The true republic in the form of hats?
3128,PART II.,"We chased the archbishop from the Duomo door,"
3129,PART II.,We chalked the walls with bloody caveats
3130,PART II.,Against all tyrants. If we did not fight
3131,PART II.,"Exactly, we fired muskets up the air"
3132,PART II.,To show that victory was ours of right.
3133,PART II.,"We met, had free discussion everywhere"
3134,PART II.,(Except perhaps i' the Chambers) day and night.
3135,PART II.,"We proved the poor should be employed, ... that's fair,--"
3136,PART II.,"And yet the rich not worked for anywise,--"
3137,PART II.,"Pay certified, yet payers abrogated,--"
3138,PART II.,"Full work secured, yet liabilities"
3139,PART II.,"To overwork excluded,--not one bated"
3140,PART II.,"Of all our holidays, that still, at twice"
3141,PART II.,"Or thrice a week, are moderately rated."
3142,PART II.,"We proved that Austria was dislodged, or would"
3143,PART II.,"Or should be, and that Tuscany in arms"
3144,PART II.,"Should, would dislodge her, ending the old feud;"
3145,PART II.,"And yet, to leave our piazzas, shops, and farms,"
3146,PART II.,"For the simple sake of fighting, was not good--"
3147,PART II.,"We proved that also. ""Did we carry charms"
3148,PART II.,"Against being killed ourselves, that we should rush"
3149,PART II.,"On killing others? what, desert herewith"
3150,PART II.,"Our wives and mothers?--was that duty? tush!"""
3151,PART II.,At which we shook the sword within the sheath
3152,PART II.,Like heroes--only louder; and the flush
3153,PART II.,Ran up the cheek to meet the future wreath.
3154,PART II.,"Nay, what we proved, we shouted--how we shouted"
3155,PART II.,"(Especially the boys did), boldly planting"
3156,PART II.,"That tree of liberty, whose fruit is doubted,"
3157,PART II.,Because the roots are not of nature's granting!
3158,PART II.,"A tree of good and evil: none, without it,"
3159,PART II.,"Grow gods; alas and, with it, men are wanting!"
3160,PART II.,
3161,PART II.,"O holy knowledge, holy liberty,"
3162,PART II.,O holy rights of nations! If I speak
3163,PART II.,These bitter things against the jugglery
3164,PART II.,"Of days that in your names proved blind and weak,"
3165,PART II.,It is that tears are bitter. When we see
3166,PART II.,"The brown skulls grin at death in churchyards bleak,"
3167,PART II.,"We do not cry ""This Yorick is too light,"""
3168,PART II.,For death grows deathlier with that mouth he makes.
3169,PART II.,So with my mocking: bitter things I write
3170,PART II.,"Because my soul is bitter for your sakes,"
3171,PART II.,O freedom! O my Florence!
3172,PART II.,
3173,PART II.,Men who might
3174,PART II.,Do greatly in a universe that breaks
3175,PART II.,"And burns, must ever _know_ before they do."
3176,PART II.,Courage and patience are but sacrifice;
3177,PART II.,And sacrifice is offered for and to
3178,PART II.,Something conceived of. Each man pays a price
3179,PART II.,"For what himself counts precious, whether true"
3180,PART II.,Or false the appreciation it implies.
3181,PART II.,"But here,--no knowledge, no conception, nought!"
3182,PART II.,"Desire was absent, that provides great deeds"
3183,PART II.,From out the greatness of prevenient thought:
3184,PART II.,"And action, action, like a flame that needs"
3185,PART II.,"A steady breath and fuel, being caught"
3186,PART II.,"Up, like a burning reed from other reeds,"
3187,PART II.,"Flashed in the empty and uncertain air,"
3188,PART II.,"Then wavered, then went out. Behold, who blames"
3189,PART II.,"A crooked course, when not a goal is there"
3190,PART II.,To round the fervid striving of the games?
3191,PART II.,An ignorance of means may minister
3192,PART II.,"To greatness, but an ignorance of aims"
3193,PART II.,Makes it impossible to be great at all.
3194,PART II.,"So with our Tuscans! Let none dare to say,"
3195,PART II.,"""Here virtue never can be national;"
3196,PART II.,Here fortitude can never cut a way
3197,PART II.,"Between the Austrian muskets, out of thrall:"""
3198,PART II.,"I tell you rather that, whoever may"
3199,PART II.,"Discern true ends here, shall grow pure enough"
3200,PART II.,"To love them, brave enough to strive for them,"
3201,PART II.,And strong to reach them though the roads be rough:
3202,PART II.,That having learnt--by no mere apophthegm--
3203,PART II.,Not just the draping of a graceful stuff
3204,PART II.,"About a statue, broidered at the hem,--"
3205,PART II.,Not just the trilling on an opera-stage
3206,PART II.,"Of ""libertà"" to bravos--(a fair word,"
3207,PART II.,Yet too allied to inarticulate rage
3208,PART II.,"And breathless sobs, for singing, though the chord"
3209,PART II.,Were deeper than they struck it) but the gauge
3210,PART II.,"Of civil wants sustained and wrongs abhorred,"
3211,PART II.,The serious sacred meaning and full use
3212,PART II.,"Of freedom for a nation,--then, indeed,"
3213,PART II.,"Our Tuscans, underneath the bloody dews"
3214,PART II.,"Of some new morning, rising up agreed"
3215,PART II.,"And bold, will want no Saxon souls or thews"
3216,PART II.,To sweep their piazzas clear of Austria's breed.
3217,PART II.,
3218,PART II.,"Alas, alas! it was not so this time."
3219,PART II.,"Conviction was not, courage failed, and truth"
3220,PART II.,Was something to be doubted of. The mime
3221,PART II.,"Changed masks, because a mime. The tide as smooth"
3222,PART II.,"In running in as out, no sense of crime"
3223,PART II.,"Because no sense of virtue,--sudden ruth"
3224,PART II.,Seized on the people: they would have again
3225,PART II.,"Their good Grand-duke and leave Guerazzi, though"
3226,PART II.,"He took that tax from Florence. ""Much in vain"
3227,PART II.,"He takes it from the market-carts, we trow,"
3228,PART II.,"While urgent that no market-men remain,"
3229,PART II.,"But all march off and leave the spade and plough,"
3230,PART II.,To die among the Lombards. Was it thus
3231,PART II.,"The dear paternal Duke did? Live the Duke!"""
3232,PART II.,"At which the joy-bells multitudinous,"
3233,PART II.,"Swept by an opposite wind, as loudly shook."
3234,PART II.,"Call back the mild archbishop to his house,"
3235,PART II.,"To bless the people with his frightened look,--"
3236,PART II.,"He shall not yet be hanged, you comprehend!"
3237,PART II.,"Seize on Guerazzi; guard him in full view,"
3238,PART II.,"Or else we stab him in the back, to end!"
3239,PART II.,"Rub out those chalked devices, set up new"
3240,PART II.,"The Duke's arms, doff your Phrygian caps, and men"
3241,PART II.,The pavement of the piazzas broke into
3242,PART II.,By barren poles of freedom: smooth the way
3243,PART II.,"For the ducal carriage, lest his highness sigh"
3244,PART II.,"""Here trees of liberty grew yesterday!"""
3245,PART II.,"""Long live the Duke!""--how roared the cannonry,"
3246,PART II.,"How rocked the bell-towers, and through thickening spray"
3247,PART II.,"Of nosegays, wreaths, and kerchiefs tossed on high,"
3248,PART II.,"How marched the civic guard, the people still"
3249,PART II.,"Being good at shouts, especially the boys!"
3250,PART II.,"Alas, poor people, of an unfledged will"
3251,PART II.,Most fitly expressed by such a callow voice!
3252,PART II.,"Alas, still poorer Duke, incapable"
3253,PART II.,Of being worthy even of so much noise!
3254,PART II.,
3255,PART II.,"You think he came back instantly, with thanks"
3256,PART II.,"And tears in his faint eyes, and hands extended"
3257,PART II.,To stretch the franchise through their utmost ranks?
3258,PART II.,"That having, like a father, apprehended,"
3259,PART II.,He came to pardon fatherly those pranks
3260,PART II.,Played out and now in filial service ended?--
3261,PART II.,"That some love-token, like a prince, he threw"
3262,PART II.,"To meet the people's love-call, in return?"
3263,PART II.,"Well, how he came I will relate to you;"
3264,PART II.,"And if your hearts should burn, why, hearts _must_ burn,"
3265,PART II.,To make the ashes which things old and new
3266,PART II.,Shall be washed clean in--as this Duke will learn.
3267,PART II.,
3268,PART II.,"From Casa Guidi windows gazing, then,"
3269,PART II.,I saw and witness how the Duke came back.
3270,PART II.,The regular tramp of horse and tread of men
3271,PART II.,Did smite the silence like an anvil black
3272,PART II.,"And sparkless. With her wide eyes at full strain,"
3273,PART II.,"Our Tuscan nurse exclaimed ""Alack, alack,"
3274,PART II.,"Signora! these shall be the Austrians."" ""Nay,"
3275,PART II.,"Be still,"" I answered, ""do not wake the child!"""
3276,PART II.,"--For so, my two-months' baby sleeping lay"
3277,PART II.,"In milky dreams upon the bed and smiled,"
3278,PART II.,"And I thought ""He shall sleep on, while he may,"
3279,PART II.,"Through the world's baseness: not being yet defiled,"
3280,PART II.,"Why should he be disturbed by what is done?"""
3281,PART II.,"Then, gazing, I beheld the long-drawn street"
3282,PART II.,"Live out, from end to end, full in the sun,"
3283,PART II.,"With Austria's thousand; sword and bayonet,"
3284,PART II.,"Horse, foot, artillery,--cannons rolling on"
3285,PART II.,Like blind slow storm-clouds gestant with the heat
3286,PART II.,"Of undeveloped lightnings, each bestrode"
3287,PART II.,"By a single man, dust-white from head to heel,"
3288,PART II.,"Indifferent as the dreadful thing he rode,"
3289,PART II.,Like a sculptured Fate serene and terrible.
3290,PART II.,As some smooth river which has overflowed
3291,PART II.,Will slow and silent down its current wheel
3292,PART II.,"A loosened forest, all the pines erect,"
3293,PART II.,"So swept, in mute significance of storm,"
3294,PART II.,The marshalled thousands; not an eye deflect
3295,PART II.,"To left or right, to catch a novel form"
3296,PART II.,Of Florence city adorned by architect
3297,PART II.,"And carver, or of Beauties live and warm"
3298,PART II.,"Scared at the casements,--all, straightforward eyes"
3299,PART II.,"And faces, held as steadfast as their swords,"
3300,PART II.,"And cognizant of acts, not imageries."
3301,PART II.,"The key, O Tuscans, too well fits the wards!"
3302,PART II.,"Ye asked for mimes,--these bring you tragedies:"
3303,PART II.,"For purple,--these shall wear it as your lords."
3304,PART II.,"Ye played like children,--die like innocents."
3305,PART II.,"Ye mimicked lightnings with a torch,--the crack"
3306,PART II.,"Of the actual bolt, your pastime circumvents."
3307,PART II.,"Ye called up ghosts, believing they were slack"
3308,PART II.,"To follow any voice from Gilboa's tents, ..."
3309,PART II.,"Here's Samuel!--and, so, Grand-dukes come back!"
3310,PART II.,
3311,PART II.,"And yet, they are no prophets though they come:"
3312,PART II.,"That awful mantle, they are drawing close,"
3313,PART II.,"Shall be searched, one day, by the shafts of Doom"
3314,PART II.,Through double folds now hoodwinking the brows.
3315,PART II.,Resuscitated monarchs disentomb
3316,PART II.,"Grave-reptiles with them, in their new life-throes."
3317,PART II.,"Let such beware. Behold, the people waits,"
3318,PART II.,"Like God: as He, in His serene of might,"
3319,PART II.,"So they, in their endurance of long straits."
3320,PART II.,"Ye stamp no nation out, though day and night"
3321,PART II.,Ye tread them with that absolute heel which grates
3322,PART II.,And grinds them flat from all attempted height.
3323,PART II.,You kill worms sooner with a garden-spade
3324,PART II.,Than you kill peoples: peoples will not die;
3325,PART II.,The tail curls stronger when you lop the head:
3326,PART II.,They writhe at every wound and multiply
3327,PART II.,And shudder into a heap of life that's made
3328,PART II.,Thus vital from God's own vitality.
3329,PART II.,'T is hard to shrivel back a day of God's
3330,PART II.,Once fixed for judgment: 't is as hard to change
3331,PART II.,"The peoples, when they rise beneath their loads"
3332,PART II.,And heave them from their backs with violent wrench
3333,PART II.,To crush the oppressor; for that judgment-rod's
3334,PART II.,The measure of this popular revenge.
3335,PART II.,
3336,PART II.,"Meanwhile, from Casa Guidi windows, we"
3337,PART II.,Beheld the armament of Austria flow
3338,PART II.,Into the drowning heart of Tuscany:
3339,PART II.,"And yet none wept, none cursed, or, if 't was so,"
3340,PART II.,They wept and cursed in silence. Silently
3341,PART II.,Our noisy Tuscans watched the invading foe;
3342,PART II.,"They had learnt silence. Pressed against the wall,"
3343,PART II.,"And grouped upon the church-steps opposite,"
3344,PART II.,A few pale men and women stared at all.
3345,PART II.,"God knows what they were feeling, with their white"
3346,PART II.,"Constrainèd faces, they, so prodigal"
3347,PART II.,"Of cry and gesture when the world goes right,"
3348,PART II.,"Or wrong indeed. But here was depth of wrong,"
3349,PART II.,"And here, still water; they were silent here;"
3350,PART II.,"And through that sentient silence, struck along"
3351,PART II.,"That measured tramp from which it stood out clear,"
3352,PART II.,"Distinct the sound and silence, like a gong"
3353,PART II.,"At midnight, each by the other awfuller,--"
3354,PART II.,While every soldier in his cap displayed
3355,PART II.,"A leaf of olive. Dusty, bitter thing!"
3356,PART II.,"Was such plucked at Novara, is it said?"
3357,PART II.,
3358,PART II.,"A cry is up in England, which doth ring"
3359,PART II.,"The hollow world through, that for ends of trade"
3360,PART II.,"And virtue and God's better worshipping,"
3361,PART II.,We henceforth should exalt the name of Peace
3362,PART II.,"And leave those rusty wars that eat the soul,--"
3363,PART II.,Besides their clippings at our golden fleece.
3364,PART II.,"I, too, have loved peace, and from bole to bole"
3365,PART II.,Of immemorial undeciduous trees
3366,PART II.,"Would write, as lovers use upon a scroll,"
3367,PART II.,The holy name of Peace and set it high
3368,PART II.,"Where none could pluck it down. On trees, I say,--"
3369,PART II.,Not upon gibbets!--With the greenery
3370,PART II.,"Of dewy branches and the flowery May,"
3371,PART II.,Sweet mediation betwixt earth and sky
3372,PART II.,"Providing, for the shepherd's holiday."
3373,PART II.,Not upon gibbets! though the vulture leaves
3374,PART II.,"The bones to quiet, which he first picked bare."
3375,PART II.,Not upon dungeons! though the wretch who grieves
3376,PART II.,And groans within less stirs the outer air
3377,PART II.,Than any little field-mouse stirs the sheaves.
3378,PART II.,Not upon chain-bolts! though the slave's despair
3379,PART II.,Has dulled his helpless miserable brain
3380,PART II.,And left him blank beneath the freeman's whip
3381,PART II.,To sing and laugh out idiocies of pain.
3382,PART II.,Nor yet on starving homes! where many a lip
3383,PART II.,Has sobbed itself asleep through curses vain.
3384,PART II.,I love no peace which is not fellowship
3385,PART II.,And which includes not mercy. I would have
3386,PART II.,Rather the raking of the guns across
3387,PART II.,"The world, and shrieks against Heaven's architrave;"
3388,PART II.,Rather the struggle in the slippery fosse
3389,PART II.,"Of dying men and horses, and the wave"
3390,PART II.,"Blood-bubbling.... Enough said!--by Christ's own cross,"
3391,PART II.,"And by this faint heart of my womanhood,"
3392,PART II.,Such things are better than a Peace that sits
3393,PART II.,"Beside a hearth in self-commended mood,"
3394,PART II.,And takes no thought how wind and rain by fits
3395,PART II.,Are howling out of doors against the good
3396,PART II.,Of the poor wanderer. What! your peace admits
3397,PART II.,Of outside anguish while it keeps at home?
3398,PART II.,I loathe to take its name upon my tongue.
3399,PART II.,"'T is nowise peace: 't is treason, stiff with doom,--"
3400,PART II.,"'T is gagged despair and inarticulate wrong,--"
3401,PART II.,"Annihilated Poland, stifled Rome,"
3402,PART II.,"Dazed Naples, Hungary fainting 'neath the thong,"
3403,PART II.,And Austria wearing a smooth olive-leaf
3404,PART II.,"On her brute forehead, while her hoofs outpress"
3405,PART II.,"The life from these Italian souls, in brief."
3406,PART II.,"O Lord of Peace, who art Lord of Righteousness,"
3407,PART II.,"Constrain the anguished worlds from sin and grief,"
3408,PART II.,"Pierce them with conscience, purge them with redress,"
3409,PART II.,And give us peace which is no counterfeit!
3410,PART II.,
3411,PART II.,But wherefore should we look out any more
3412,PART II.,"From Casa Guidi windows? Shut them straight,"
3413,PART II.,"And let us sit down by the folded door,"
3414,PART II.,"And veil our saddened faces and, so, wait"
3415,PART II.,What next the judgment-heavens make ready for.
3416,PART II.,I have grown too weary of these windows. Sights
3417,PART II.,"Come thick enough and clear enough in thought,"
3418,PART II.,Without the sunshine; souls have inner lights.
3419,PART II.,And since the Grand-duke has come back and brought
3420,PART II.,This army of the North which thus requites
3421,PART II.,"His filial South, we leave him to be taught."
3422,PART II.,"His South, too, has learnt something certainly,"
3423,PART II.,Whereof the practice will bring profit soon;
3424,PART II.,"And peradventure other eyes may see,"
3425,PART II.,"From Casa Guidi windows, what is done"
3426,PART II.,"Or undone. Whatsoever deeds they be,"
3427,PART II.,Pope Pius will be glorified in none.
3428,PART II.,"Record that gain, Mazzini!--it shall top"
3429,PART II.,"Some heights of sorrow. Peter's rock, so named,"
3430,PART II.,Shall lure no vessel any more to drop
3431,PART II.,Among the breakers. Peter's chair is shamed
3432,PART II.,Like any vulgar throne the nations lop
3433,PART II.,"To pieces for their firewood unreclaimed,--"
3434,PART II.,"And, when it burns too, we shall see as well"
3435,PART II.,In Italy as elsewhere. Let it burn.
3436,PART II.,"The cross, accounted still adorable,"
3437,PART II.,Is Christ's cross only!--if the thief's would earn
3438,PART II.,"Some stealthy genuflexions, we rebel;"
3439,PART II.,"And here the impenitent thief's has had its turn,"
3440,PART II.,As God knows; and the people on their knees
3441,PART II.,Scoff and toss back the crosiers stretched like yokes
3442,PART II.,To press their heads down lower by degrees.
3443,PART II.,"So Italy, by means of these last strokes,"
3444,PART II.,"Escapes the danger which preceded these,"
3445,PART II.,"Of leaving captured hands in cloven oaks,--"
3446,PART II.,Of leaving very souls within the buckle
3447,PART II.,"Whence bodies struggled outward,--of supposing"
3448,PART II.,"That freemen may like bondsmen kneel and truckle,"
3449,PART II.,"And then stand up as usual, without losing"
3450,PART II.,An inch of stature.
3451,PART II.,Those whom she-wolves suckle
3452,PART II.,Will bite as wolves do in the grapple-closing
3453,PART II.,Of adverse interests. This at last is known
3454,PART II.,"(Thank Pius for the lesson), that albeit"
3455,PART II.,Among the popedom's hundred heads of stone
3456,PART II.,Which blink down on you from the roof's retreat
3457,PART II.,"In Siena's tiger-striped cathedral, Joan"
3458,PART II.,"And Borgia 'mid their fellows you may greet,"
3459,PART II.,"A harlot and a devil,--you will see"
3460,PART II.,"Not a man, still less angel, grandly set"
3461,PART II.,With open soul to render man more free.
3462,PART II.,"The fishers are still thinking of the net,"
3463,PART II.,"And, if not thinking of the hook too, we"
3464,PART II.,Are counted somewhat deeply in their debt;
3465,PART II.,"But that's a rare case--so, by hook and crook"
3466,PART II.,"They take the advantage, agonizing Christ"
3467,PART II.,"By rustier nails than those of Cedron's brook,"
3468,PART II.,"I' the people's body very cheaply priced,--"
3469,PART II.,"And quote high priesthood out of Holy book,"
3470,PART II.,While buying death-fields with the sacrificed.
3471,PART II.,
3472,PART II.,"Priests, priests,--there's no such name!--God's own, except"
3473,PART II.,Ye take most vainly. Through heaven's lifted gate
3474,PART II.,The priestly ephod in sole glory swept
3475,PART II.,"When Christ ascended, entered in, and sate"
3476,PART II.,(With victor face sublimely overwept)
3477,PART II.,"At Deity's right hand, to mediate,"
3478,PART II.,"He alone, He for ever. On His breast"
3479,PART II.,"The Urim and the Thummim, fed with fire"
3480,PART II.,"From the full Godhead, flicker with the unrest"
3481,PART II.,"Of human pitiful heart-beats. Come up higher,"
3482,PART II.,All Christians! Levi's tribe is dispossest.
3483,PART II.,"That solitary alb ye shall admire,"
3484,PART II.,"But not cast lots for. The last chrism, poured right,"
3485,PART II.,"Was on that Head, and poured for burial"
3486,PART II.,And not for domination in men's sight.
3487,PART II.,What _are_ these churches? The old temple-wall
3488,PART II.,Doth overlook them juggling with the sleight
3489,PART II.,"Of surplice, candlestick and altar-pall;"
3490,PART II.,"East church and west church, ay, north church and south,"
3491,PART II.,"Rome's church and England's,--let them all repent,"
3492,PART II.,"And make concordats 'twixt their soul and mouth,"
3493,PART II.,"Succeed Saint Paul by working at the tent,"
3494,PART II.,"Become infallible guides by speaking truth,"
3495,PART II.,And excommunicate their pride that bent
3496,PART II.,And cramped the souls of men.
3497,PART II.,"Why, even here"
3498,PART II.,"Priestcraft burns out, the twinèd linen blazes;"
3499,PART II.,"Not, like asbestos, to grow white and clear,"
3500,PART II.,But all to perish!--while the fire-smell raises
3501,PART II.,"To life some swooning spirits who, last year,"
3502,PART II.,Lost breath and heart in these church-stifled places.
3503,PART II.,"Why, almost, through this Pius, we believed"
3504,PART II.,"The priesthood could be an honest thing, he smiled"
3505,PART II.,So saintly while our corn was being sheaved
3506,PART II.,For his own granaries! Showing now defiled
3507,PART II.,"His hireling hands, a better help's achieved"
3508,PART II.,Than if they blessed us shepherd-like and mild.
3509,PART II.,"False doctrine, strangled by its own amen,"
3510,PART II.,Dies in the throat of all this nation. Who
3511,PART II.,Will speak a pope's name as they rise again?
3512,PART II.,What woman or what child will count him true?
3513,PART II.,What dreamer praise him with the voice or pen?
3514,PART II.,What man fight for him?--Pius takes his due.
3515,PART II.,
3516,PART II.,*       *       *       *       *
3517,PART II.,
3518,PART II.,"Record that gain, Mazzini!--Yes, but first"
3519,PART II.,Set down thy people's faults; set down the want
3520,PART II.,"Of soul-conviction; set down aims dispersed,"
3521,PART II.,"And incoherent means, and valour scant"
3522,PART II.,"Because of scanty faith, and schisms accursed"
3523,PART II.,That wrench these brother-hearts from covenant
3524,PART II.,"With freedom and each other. Set down this,"
3525,PART II.,"And this, and see to overcome it when"
3526,PART II.,The seasons bring the fruits thou wilt not miss
3527,PART II.,If wary. Let no cry of patriot men
3528,PART II.,Distract thee from the stern analysis
3529,PART II.,Of masses who cry only! keep thy ken
3530,PART II.,Clear as thy soul is virtuous. Heroes' blood
3531,PART II.,Splashed up against thy noble brow in Rome;
3532,PART II.,Let such not blind thee to an interlude
3533,PART II.,"Which was not also holy, yet did come"
3534,PART II.,"'Twixt sacramental actions,--brotherhood"
3535,PART II.,"Despised even there, and something of the doom"
3536,PART II.,Of Remus in the trenches. Listen now--
3537,PART II.,Rossi died silent near where Cæsar died.
3538,PART II.,"HE did not say ""My Brutus, is it thou?"""
3539,PART II.,But Italy unquestioned testified
3540,PART II.,"""_I_ killed him! _I_ am Brutus.--I avow."""
3541,PART II.,At which the whole world's laugh of scorn replied
3542,PART II.,"""A poor maimed copy of Brutus!"""
3543,PART II.,"Too much like,"
3544,PART II.,"Indeed, to be so unlike! too unskilled"
3545,PART II.,"At Philippi and the honest battle-pike,"
3546,PART II.,To be so skilful where a man is killed
3547,PART II.,"Near Pompey's statue, and the daggers strike"
3548,PART II.,At unawares i' the throat. Was thus fulfilled
3549,PART II.,An omen once of Michel Angelo?--
3550,PART II.,"When Marcus Brutus he conceived complete,"
3551,PART II.,And strove to hurl him out by blow on blow
3552,PART II.,"Upon the marble, at Art's thunderheat,"
3553,PART II.,Till haply (some pre-shadow rising slow
3554,PART II.,Of what his Italy would fancy meet
3555,PART II.,To be called BRUTUS) straight his plastic hand
3556,PART II.,"Fell back before his prophet-soul, and left"
3557,PART II.,"A fragment, a maimed Brutus,--but more grand"
3558,PART II.,"Than this, so named at Rome, was!"
3559,PART II.,Let thy weft
3560,PART II.,"Present one woof and warp, Mazzini! Stand"
3561,PART II.,"With no man hankering for a dagger's heft,"
3562,PART II.,"No, not for Italy!--nor stand apart,"
3563,PART II.,"No, not for the Republic!--from those pure"
3564,PART II.,Brave men who hold the level of thy heart
3565,PART II.,"In patriot truth, as lover and as doer,"
3566,PART II.,Albeit they will not follow where thou art
3567,PART II.,As extreme theorist. Trust and distrust fewer;
3568,PART II.,And so bind strong and keep unstained the cause
3569,PART II.,Which (God's sign granted) war-trumps newly blown
3570,PART II.,Shall yet annunciate to the world's applause.
3571,PART II.,
3572,PART II.,"But now, the world is busy; it has grown"
3573,PART II.,A Fair-going world. Imperial England draws
3574,PART II.,"The flowing ends of the earth from Fez, Canton,"
3575,PART II.,"Delhi and Stockholm, Athens and Madrid,"
3576,PART II.,"The Russias and the vast Americas,"
3577,PART II.,As if a queen drew in her robes amid
3578,PART II.,"Her golden cincture,--isles, peninsulas,"
3579,PART II.,"Capes, continents, far inland countries hid"
3580,PART II.,"By jasper-sands and hills of chrysopras,"
3581,PART II.,All trailing in their splendours through the door
3582,PART II.,"Of the gorgeous Crystal Palace. Every nation,"
3583,PART II.,"To every other nation strange of yore,"
3584,PART II.,"Gives face to face the civic salutation,"
3585,PART II.,And holds up in a proud right hand before
3586,PART II.,That congress the best work which she can fashion
3587,PART II.,"By her best means. ""These corals, will you please"
3588,PART II.,To match against your oaks? They grow as fast
3589,PART II.,"Within my wilderness of purple seas.""--"
3590,PART II.,"""This diamond stared upon me as I passed"
3591,PART II.,(As a live god's eye from a marble frieze)
3592,PART II.,"Along a dark of diamonds. Is it classed?""--"
3593,PART II.,"""I wove these stuffs so subtly that the gold"
3594,PART II.,Swims to the surface of the silk like cream
3595,PART II.,"And curdles to fair patterns. Ye behold!""--"
3596,PART II.,"""These delicatest muslins rather seem"
3597,PART II.,"Than be, you think? Nay, touch them and be bold,"
3598,PART II.,"Though such veiled Chakhi's face in Hafiz' dream.""--"
3599,PART II.,"""These carpets--you walk slow on them like kings,"
3600,PART II.,"Inaudible like spirits, while your foot"
3601,PART II.,"Dips deep in velvet roses and such things.""--"
3602,PART II.,"""Even Apollonius might commend this flute:[13]"
3603,PART II.,"The music, winding through the stops, upsprings"
3604,PART II.,"To make the player very rich: compute!"""
3605,PART II.,"""Here's goblet-glass, to take in with your wine"
3606,PART II.,The very sun its grapes were ripened under:
3607,PART II.,"Drink light and juice together, and each fine.""--"
3608,PART II.,"""This model of a steamship moves your wonder?"
3609,PART II.,You should behold it crushing down the brine
3610,PART II.,"Like a blind Jove who feels his way with thunder.""--"
3611,PART II.,"""Here's sculpture! Ah, _we_ live too! why not throw"
3612,PART II.,Our life into our marbles? Art has place
3613,PART II.,"For other artists after Angelo.""--"
3614,PART II.,"""I tried to paint out here a natural face;"
3615,PART II.,"For nature includes Raffael, as we know,"
3616,PART II.,"Not Raffael nature. Will it help my case?""--"
3617,PART II.,"""Methinks you will not match this steel of ours!""--"
3618,PART II.,"""Nor you this porcelain! One might dream the clay"
3619,PART II.,"Retained in it the larvæ of the flowers,"
3620,PART II.,"They bud so, round the cup, the old Spring-way.""--"
3621,PART II.,"""Nor you these carven woods, where birds in bowers"
3622,PART II.,"With twisting snakes and climbing cupids, play."""
3623,PART II.,
3624,PART II.,"O Magi of the east and of the west,"
3625,PART II.,"Your incense, gold and myrrh are excellent!--"
3626,PART II.,"What gifts for Christ, then, bring ye with the rest?"
3627,PART II.,Your hands have worked well: is your courage spent
3628,PART II.,"In handwork only? Have you nothing best,"
3629,PART II.,"Which generous souls may perfect and present,"
3630,PART II.,And He shall thank the givers for? no light
3631,PART II.,"Of teaching, liberal nations, for the poor"
3632,PART II.,Who sit in darkness when it is not night?
3633,PART II.,"No cure for wicked children? Christ,--no cure!"
3634,PART II.,No help for women sobbing out of sight
3635,PART II.,Because men made the laws? no brothel-lure
3636,PART II.,Burnt out by popular lightnings? Hast thou four
3637,PART II.,"No remedy, my England, for such woes?"
3638,PART II.,"No outlet, Austria, for the scourged and bound,"
3639,PART II.,"No entrance for the exiled? no repose,"
3640,PART II.,"Russia, for knouted Poles worked underground,"
3641,PART II.,And gentle ladies bleached among the snows?
3642,PART II.,"No mercy for the slave, America?"
3643,PART II.,"No hope for Rome, free France, chivalric France?"
3644,PART II.,"Alas, great nations have great shames, I say."
3645,PART II.,"No pity, O world, no tender utterance"
3646,PART II.,"Of benediction, and prayers stretched this way"
3647,PART II.,"For poor Italia, baffled by mischance?"
3648,PART II.,"O gracious nations, give some ear to me!"
3649,PART II.,"You all go to your Fair, and I am one"
3650,PART II.,Who at the roadside of humanity
3651,PART II.,"Beseech your alms,--God's justice to be done."
3652,PART II.,"So, prosper!"
3653,PART II.,
3654,PART II.,"In the name of Italy,"
3655,PART II.,"Meantime, her patriot Dead have benison."
3656,PART II.,"They only have done well; and, what they did"
3657,PART II.,"Being perfect, it shall triumph. Let them slumber:"
3658,PART II.,No king of Egypt in a pyramid
3659,PART II.,"Is safer from oblivion, though he number"
3660,PART II.,Full seventy cerements for a coverlid.
3661,PART II.,"These Dead be seeds of life, and shall encumber"
3662,PART II.,The sad heart of the land until it loose
3663,PART II.,The clammy clods and let out the Spring-growth
3664,PART II.,In beatific green through every bruise.
3665,PART II.,"The tyrant should take heed to what he doth,"
3666,PART II.,"Since every victim-carrion turns to use,"
3667,PART II.,"And drives a chariot, like a god made wroth,"
3668,PART II.,"Against each piled injustice. Ay, the least,"
3669,PART II.,"Dead for Italia, not in vain has died;"
3670,PART II.,"Though many vainly, ere life's struggle ceased,"
3671,PART II.,To mad dissimilar ends have swerved aside;
3672,PART II.,Each grave her nationality has pieced
3673,PART II.,"By its own majestic breadth, and fortified"
3674,PART II.,And pinned it deeper to the soil. Forlorn
3675,PART II.,"Of thanks be, therefore, no one of these graves!"
3676,PART II.,"Not Hers,--who, at her husband's side, in scorn,"
3677,PART II.,"Outfaced the whistling shot and hissing waves,"
3678,PART II.,Until she felt her little babe unborn
3679,PART II.,"Recoil, within her, from the violent staves"
3680,PART II.,"And bloodhounds of the world,--at which, her life"
3681,PART II.,Dropt inwards from her eyes and followed it
3682,PART II.,Beyond the hunters. Garibaldi's wife
3683,PART II.,"And child died so. And now, the seaweeds fit"
3684,PART II.,"Her body, like a proper shroud and coif,"
3685,PART II.,And murmurously the ebbing waters grit
3686,PART II.,The little pebbles while she lies interred
3687,PART II.,"In the sea-sand. Perhaps, ere dying thus,"
3688,PART II.,She looked up in his face (which never stirred
3689,PART II.,From its clenched anguish) as to make excuse
3690,PART II.,"For leaving him for his, if so she erred."
3691,PART II.,He well remembers that she could not choose.
3692,PART II.,A memorable grave! Another is
3693,PART II.,"At Genoa. There, a king may fitly lie,"
3694,PART II.,"Who, bursting that heroic heart of his"
3695,PART II.,"At lost Novara, that he could not die"
3696,PART II.,(Though thrice into the cannon's eyes for this
3697,PART II.,"He plunged his shuddering steed, and felt the sky"
3698,PART II.,"Reel back between the fire-shocks), stripped away"
3699,PART II.,"The ancestral ermine ere the smoke had cleared,"
3700,PART II.,"And, naked to the soul, that none might say"
3701,PART II.,His kingship covered what was base and bleared
3702,PART II.,"With treason, went out straight an exile, yea,"
3703,PART II.,An exiled patriot. Let him be revered.
3704,PART II.,
3705,PART II.,"Yea, verily, Charles Albert has died well;"
3706,PART II.,"And if he lived not all so, as one spoke,"
3707,PART II.,The sin pass softly with the passing-bell;
3708,PART II.,"For he was shriven, I think, in cannon-smoke,"
3709,PART II.,"And, taking off his crown, made visible"
3710,PART II.,A hero's forehead. Shaking Austria's yoke
3711,PART II.,"He shattered his own hand and heart. ""So best,"""
3712,PART II.,"His last words were upon his lonely bed,"
3713,PART II.,I do not end like popes and dukes at least--
3714,PART II.,"""Thank God for it."" And now that he is dead,"
3715,PART II.,Admitting it is proved and manifest
3716,PART II.,"That he was worthy, with a discrowned head,"
3717,PART II.,"To measure heights with patriots, let them stand"
3718,PART II.,"Beside the man in his Oporto shroud,"
3719,PART II.,"And each vouchsafe to take him by the hand,"
3720,PART II.,"And kiss him on the cheek, and say aloud,--"
3721,PART II.,"""Thou, too, hast suffered for our native land!"
3722,PART II.,"My brother, thou art one of us! be proud."""
3723,PART II.,
3724,PART II.,"Still, graves, when Italy is talked upon."
3725,PART II.,"Still, still, the patriot's tomb, the stranger's hate."
3726,PART II.,"Still Niobe! still fainting in the sun,"
3727,PART II.,By whose most dazzling arrows violate
3728,PART II.,Her beauteous offspring perished! has she won
3729,PART II.,"Nothing but garlands for the graves, from Fate?"
3730,PART II.,"Nothing but death-songs?--Yes, be it understood"
3731,PART II.,Life throbs in noble Piedmont! while the feet
3732,PART II.,"Of Rome's clay image, dabbled soft in blood,"
3733,PART II.,"Grow flat with dissolution and, as meet,"
3734,PART II.,"Will soon be shovelled off like other mud,"
3735,PART II.,To leave the passage free in church and street.
3736,PART II.,"And I, who first took hope up in this song,"
3737,PART II.,"Because a child was singing one ... behold,"
3738,PART II.,"The hope and omen were not, haply, wrong!"
3739,PART II.,"Poets are soothsayers still, like those of old"
3740,PART II.,Who studied flights of doves; and creatures young
3741,PART II.,"And tender, mighty meanings may unfold."
3742,PART II.,
3743,PART II.,"The sun strikes, through the windows, up the floor;"
3744,PART II.,"Stand out in it, my own young Florentine,"
3745,PART II.,"Not two years old, and let me see thee more!"
3746,PART II.,"It grows along thy amber curls, to shine"
3747,PART II.,"Brighter than elsewhere. Now, look straight before,"
3748,PART II.,"And fix thy brave blue English eyes on mine,"
3749,PART II.,"And from my soul, which fronts the future so,"
3750,PART II.,"With unabashed and unabated gaze,"
3751,PART II.,"Teach me to hope for, what the angels know"
3752,PART II.,When they smile clear as thou dost. Down God's ways
3753,PART II.,"With just alighted feet, between the snow"
3754,PART II.,"And snowdrops, where a little lamb may graze,"
3755,PART II.,"Thou hast no fear, my lamb, about the road,"
3756,PART II.,Albeit in our vain-glory we assume
3757,PART II.,"That, less than we have, thou hast learnt of God."
3758,PART II.,"Stand out, my blue-eyed prophet!--thou, to whom"
3759,PART II.,"The earliest world-day light that ever flowed,"
3760,PART II.,Through Casa Guidi Windows chanced to come!
3761,PART II.,"Now shake the glittering nimbus of thy hair,"
3762,PART II.,And be God's witness that the elemental
3763,PART II.,New springs of life are gushing everywhere
3764,PART II.,"To cleanse the watercourses, and prevent all"
3765,PART II.,Concrete obstructions which infest the air!
3766,PART II.,"That earth's alive, and gentle or ungentle"
3767,PART II.,"Motions within her, signify but growth!--"
3768,PART II.,The ground swells greenest o'er the labouring moles.
3769,PART II.,

3804,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
3805,PREFACE.,
3806,PREFACE.,
3807,PREFACE.,These poems were written under the pressure of the events they
3808,PREFACE.,"indicate, after a residence in Italy of so many years that the present"
3809,PREFACE.,triumph of great principles is heightened to the writer's feelings by
3810,PREFACE.,"the disastrous issue of the last movement, witnessed from ""Casa Guidi"
3811,PREFACE.,"Windows"" in 1849. Yet, if the verses should appear to English readers"
3812,PREFACE.,too pungently rendered to admit of a patriotic respect to the English
3813,PREFACE.,"sense of things, I will not excuse myself on such grounds, nor on the"
3814,PREFACE.,ground of my attachment to the Italian people and my admiration of
3815,PREFACE.,their heroic constancy and union. What I have written has simply been
3816,PREFACE.,"written because I love truth and justice _quand même_,--""more than"
3817,PREFACE.,"Plato"" and Plato's country, more than Dante and Dante's country, more"
3818,PREFACE.,even than Shakespeare and Shakespeare's country.
3819,PREFACE.,
3820,PREFACE.,"And if patriotism means the flattery of one's nation in every case,"
3821,PREFACE.,"then the patriot, take it as you please, is merely the courtier which"
3822,PREFACE.,"I am not, though I have written ""Napoleon III. in Italy."" It is time"
3823,PREFACE.,"to limit the significance of certain terms, or to enlarge the"
3824,PREFACE.,significance of certain things. Nationality is excellent in its
3825,PREFACE.,"place; and the instinct of self-love is the root of a man, which will"
3826,PREFACE.,develop into sacrificial virtues. But all the virtues are means and
3827,PREFACE.,"uses; and, if we hinder their tendency to growth and expansion, we"
3828,PREFACE.,"both destroy them as virtues, and degrade them to that rankest"
3829,PREFACE.,species of corruption reserved for the most noble organizations. For
3830,PREFACE.,"instance,--non-intervention in the affairs of neighbouring states is a"
3831,PREFACE.,"high political virtue; but non-intervention does not mean, passing"
3832,PREFACE.,"by on the other side when your neighbour falls among thieves,--or"
3833,PREFACE.,Phariseeism would recover it from Christianity. Freedom itself is
3834,PREFACE.,"virtue, as well as privilege; but freedom of the seas does not mean"
3835,PREFACE.,"piracy, nor freedom of the land, brigandage; nor freedom of the"
3836,PREFACE.,"senate, freedom to cudgel a dissident member; nor freedom of the"
3837,PREFACE.,"press, freedom to calumniate and lie. So, if patriotism be a virtue"
3838,PREFACE.,"indeed, it cannot mean an exclusive devotion to our country's"
3839,PREFACE.,"interests,--for that is only another form of devotion to personal"
3840,PREFACE.,"interests, family interests, or provincial interests, all of which,"
3841,PREFACE.,"if not driven past themselves, are vulgar and immoral objects. Let"
3842,PREFACE.,"us put away the Little Peddlingtonism unworthy of a great nation, and"
3843,PREFACE.,too prevalent among us. If the man who does not look beyond this
3844,PREFACE.,"natural life is of a somewhat narrow order, what must be the man who"
3845,PREFACE.,does not look beyond his own frontier or his own sea?
3846,PREFACE.,
3847,PREFACE.,I confess that I dream of the day when an English statesman shall
3848,PREFACE.,arise with a heart too large for England; having courage in the face
3849,PREFACE.,"of his countrymen to assert of some suggested policy,--""This is good"
3850,PREFACE.,for your trade; this is necessary for your domination: but it will vex
3851,PREFACE.,a people hard by; it will hurt a people farther off; it will profit
3852,PREFACE.,"nothing to the general humanity: therefore, away with it!--it is not"
3853,PREFACE.,"for you or for me."" When a British minister dares speak so, and when a"
3854,PREFACE.,"British public applauds him speaking, then shall the nation be"
3855,PREFACE.,"glorious, and her praise, instead of exploding from within, from loud"
3856,PREFACE.,"civic mouths, come to her from without, as all worthy praise must,"
3857,PREFACE.,from the alliances she has fostered and the populations she has
3858,PREFACE.,saved.
3859,PREFACE.,
3860,PREFACE.,And poets who write of the events of that time shall not need to
3861,PREFACE.,justify themselves in prefaces for ever so little jarring of the
3862,PREFACE.,national sentiment imputable to their rhymes.
