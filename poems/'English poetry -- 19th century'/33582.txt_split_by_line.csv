178,CANTO I.,
179,CANTO I.,"One winter night, at half-past nine,"
180,CANTO I.,"Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,"
181,CANTO I.,"I had come home, too late to dine,"
182,CANTO I.,"And supper, with cigars and wine,"
183,CANTO I.,Was waiting in the study.
184,CANTO I.,
185,CANTO I.,"There was a strangeness in the room,"
186,CANTO I.,And Something white and wavy
187,CANTO I.,Was standing near me in the gloom--
188,CANTO I.,_I_ took it for the carpet-broom
189,CANTO I.,Left by that careless slavey.
190,CANTO I.,
191,CANTO I.,[Illustration]
192,CANTO I.,
193,CANTO I.,But presently the Thing began
194,CANTO I.,To shiver and to sneeze:
195,CANTO I.,"On which I said ""Come, come, my man!"
196,CANTO I.,That's a most inconsiderate plan.
197,CANTO I.,"Less noise there, if you please!"""
198,CANTO I.,
199,CANTO I.,"""I've caught a cold,"" the Thing replies,"
200,CANTO I.,"""Out there upon the landing."""
201,CANTO I.,"I turned to look in some surprise,"
202,CANTO I.,"And there, before my very eyes,"
203,CANTO I.,A little Ghost was standing!
204,CANTO I.,
205,CANTO I.,"He trembled when he caught my eye,"
206,CANTO I.,And got behind a chair.
207,CANTO I.,"""How came you here,"" I said, ""and why?"
208,CANTO I.,I never saw a thing so shy.
209,CANTO I.,"Come out! Don't shiver there!"""
210,CANTO I.,
211,CANTO I.,"He said ""I'd gladly tell you how,"
212,CANTO I.,And also tell you why;
213,CANTO I.,"But"" (here he gave a little bow)"
214,CANTO I.,"""You're in so bad a temper now,"
215,CANTO I.,You'd think it all a lie.
216,CANTO I.,
217,CANTO I.,"""And as to being in a fright,"
218,CANTO I.,Allow me to remark
219,CANTO I.,"That Ghosts have just as good a right,"
220,CANTO I.,"In every way, to fear the light,"
221,CANTO I.,"As Men to fear the dark."""
222,CANTO I.,
223,CANTO I.,"""No plea,"" said I, ""can well excuse"
224,CANTO I.,Such cowardice in you:
225,CANTO I.,"For Ghosts can visit when they choose,"
226,CANTO I.,Whereas we Humans ca'n't refuse
227,CANTO I.,"To grant the interview."""
228,CANTO I.,
229,CANTO I.,"He said ""A flutter of alarm"
230,CANTO I.,"Is not unnatural, is it?"
231,CANTO I.,I really feared you meant some harm:
232,CANTO I.,"But, now I see that you are calm,"
233,CANTO I.,Let me explain my visit.
234,CANTO I.,
235,CANTO I.,"""Houses are classed, I beg to state,"
236,CANTO I.,According to the number
237,CANTO I.,Of Ghosts that they accommodate:
238,CANTO I.,"(The Tenant merely counts as _weight_,"
239,CANTO I.,With Coals and other lumber).
240,CANTO I.,
241,CANTO I.,"""This is a 'one-ghost' house, and you"
242,CANTO I.,"When you arrived last summer,"
243,CANTO I.,May have remarked a Spectre who
244,CANTO I.,Was doing all that Ghosts can do
245,CANTO I.,To welcome the new-comer.
246,CANTO I.,
247,CANTO I.,"""In Villas this is always done--"
248,CANTO I.,However cheaply rented:
249,CANTO I.,"For, though of course there's less of fun"
250,CANTO I.,"When there is only room for one,"
251,CANTO I.,Ghosts have to be contented.
252,CANTO I.,
253,CANTO I.,"""That Spectre left you on the Third--"
254,CANTO I.,Since then you've not been haunted:
255,CANTO I.,"For, as he never sent us word,"
256,CANTO I.,'Twas quite by accident we heard
257,CANTO I.,That any one was wanted.
258,CANTO I.,
259,CANTO I.,"""A Spectre has first choice, by right,"
260,CANTO I.,In filling up a vacancy;
261,CANTO I.,"Then Phantom, Goblin, Elf, and Sprite--"
262,CANTO I.,"If all these fail them, they invite"
263,CANTO I.,The nicest Ghoul that they can see.
264,CANTO I.,
265,CANTO I.,"""The Spectres said the place was low,"
266,CANTO I.,And that you kept bad wine:
267,CANTO I.,"So, as a Phantom had to go,"
268,CANTO I.,"And I was first, of course, you know,"
269,CANTO I.,"I couldn't well decline."""
270,CANTO I.,
271,CANTO I.,"""No doubt,"" said I, ""they settled who"
272,CANTO I.,Was fittest to be sent:
273,CANTO I.,"Yet still to choose a brat like you,"
274,CANTO I.,"To haunt a man of forty-two,"
275,CANTO I.,"Was no great compliment!"""
276,CANTO I.,
277,CANTO I.,"""I'm not so young, Sir,"" he replied,"
278,CANTO I.,"""As you might think. The fact is,"
279,CANTO I.,"In caverns by the water-side,"
280,CANTO I.,"And other places that I've tried,"
281,CANTO I.,I've had a lot of practice:
282,CANTO I.,
283,CANTO I.,"""But I have never taken yet"
284,CANTO I.,"A strict domestic part,"
285,CANTO I.,And in my flurry I forget
286,CANTO I.,The Five Good Rules of Etiquette
287,CANTO I.,"We have to know by heart."""
288,CANTO I.,
289,CANTO I.,My sympathies were warming fast
290,CANTO I.,Towards the little fellow:
291,CANTO I.,He was so utterly aghast
292,CANTO I.,"At having found a Man at last,"
293,CANTO I.,And looked so scared and yellow.
294,CANTO I.,
295,CANTO I.,"[Illustration: ""IN CAVERNS BY THE WATER-SIDE""]"
296,CANTO I.,
297,CANTO I.,"""At least,"" I said, ""I'm glad to find"
298,CANTO I.,A Ghost is not a _dumb_ thing!

1620,THE THREE VOICES.,
1621,THE THREE VOICES.,He trilled a carol fresh and free:
1622,THE THREE VOICES.,He laughed aloud for very glee:
1623,THE THREE VOICES.,There came a breeze from off the sea:
1624,THE THREE VOICES.,
1625,THE THREE VOICES.,It passed athwart the glooming flat--
1626,THE THREE VOICES.,It fanned his forehead as he sat--
1627,THE THREE VOICES.,"It lightly bore away his hat,"
1628,THE THREE VOICES.,
1629,THE THREE VOICES.,All to the feet of one who stood
1630,THE THREE VOICES.,"Like maid enchanted in a wood,"
1631,THE THREE VOICES.,Frowning as darkly as she could.
1632,THE THREE VOICES.,
1633,THE THREE VOICES.,"With huge umbrella, lank and brown,"
1634,THE THREE VOICES.,"Unerringly she pinned it down,"
1635,THE THREE VOICES.,Right through the centre of the crown.
1636,THE THREE VOICES.,
1637,THE THREE VOICES.,"Then, with an aspect cold and grim,"
1638,THE THREE VOICES.,"Regardless of its battered rim,"
1639,THE THREE VOICES.,She took it up and gave it him.
1640,THE THREE VOICES.,
1641,THE THREE VOICES.,"A while like one in dreams he stood,"
1642,THE THREE VOICES.,Then faltered forth his gratitude
1643,THE THREE VOICES.,In words just short of being rude:
1644,THE THREE VOICES.,
1645,THE THREE VOICES.,"For it had lost its shape and shine,"
1646,THE THREE VOICES.,"And it had cost him four-and-nine,"

1654,THE THREE VOICES.,
1655,THE THREE VOICES.,The tear-drop trickled to his chin:
1656,THE THREE VOICES.,There was a meaning in her grin
1657,THE THREE VOICES.,That made him feel on fire within.
1658,THE THREE VOICES.,
1659,THE THREE VOICES.,"""Term it not 'radiance,'"" said he:"
1660,THE THREE VOICES.,"""'Tis solid nutriment to me."

1679,THE THREE VOICES.,"""Canst thou desire or pie or puff?"

1694,THE THREE VOICES.,
1695,THE THREE VOICES.,"""We grant them--there is no escape--"
1696,THE THREE VOICES.,A sort of semi-human shape
1697,THE THREE VOICES.,"Suggestive of the man-like Ape."""

1699,THE THREE VOICES.,"""In all such theories,"" said he,"

1703,THE THREE VOICES.,"Baffled, she gave a wolfish bark:"
1704,THE THREE VOICES.,"He, aiming blindly in the dark,"
1705,THE THREE VOICES.,With random shaft had pierced the mark.
1706,THE THREE VOICES.,
1707,THE THREE VOICES.,"She felt that her defeat was plain,"
1708,THE THREE VOICES.,Yet madly strove with might and main
1709,THE THREE VOICES.,To get the upper hand again.
1710,THE THREE VOICES.,
1711,THE THREE VOICES.,"Fixing her eyes upon the beach,"
1712,THE THREE VOICES.,"As though unconscious of his speech,"
1713,THE THREE VOICES.,"She said ""Each gives to more than each."""
1714,THE THREE VOICES.,
1715,THE THREE VOICES.,He could not answer yea or nay:
1716,THE THREE VOICES.,"He faltered ""Gifts may pass away."""
1717,THE THREE VOICES.,Yet knew not what he meant to say.
1718,THE THREE VOICES.,
1719,THE THREE VOICES.,"""If that be so,"" she straight replied,"
1720,THE THREE VOICES.,"""Each heart with each doth coincide."

1727,THE THREE VOICES.,"Is but a Notion--unto me."""
1728,THE THREE VOICES.,
1729,THE THREE VOICES.,And darkly fell her answer dread
1730,THE THREE VOICES.,"Upon his unresisting head,"
1731,THE THREE VOICES.,Like half a hundredweight of lead.
1732,THE THREE VOICES.,
1733,THE THREE VOICES.,"""The Good and Great must ever shun"
1734,THE THREE VOICES.,That reckless and abandoned one

1736,THE THREE VOICES.,
1737,THE THREE VOICES.,"""The man that smokes--that reads the _Times_--"

1741,THE THREE VOICES.,"He felt it was his turn to speak,"
1742,THE THREE VOICES.,"And, with a shamed and crimson cheek,"
1743,THE THREE VOICES.,"Moaned ""This is harder than Bezique!"""
1744,THE THREE VOICES.,
1745,THE THREE VOICES.,"But when she asked him ""Wherefore so?"""
1746,THE THREE VOICES.,"He felt his very whiskers glow,"

1749,THE THREE VOICES.,"[Illustration: ""THIS IS HARDER THAN BEZIQUE!""]"
1750,THE THREE VOICES.,
1751,THE THREE VOICES.,"While, like broad waves of golden grain,"
1752,THE THREE VOICES.,"Or sunlit hues on cloistered pane,"
1753,THE THREE VOICES.,His colour came and went again.
1754,THE THREE VOICES.,
1755,THE THREE VOICES.,"Pitying his obvious distress,"
1756,THE THREE VOICES.,"Yet with a tinge of bitterness,"
1757,THE THREE VOICES.,"She said ""The More exceeds the Less."""
1758,THE THREE VOICES.,
1759,THE THREE VOICES.,"""A truth of such undoubted weight,"""
1760,THE THREE VOICES.,"He urged, ""and so extreme in date,"
1761,THE THREE VOICES.,"It were superfluous to state."""
1762,THE THREE VOICES.,
1763,THE THREE VOICES.,"Roused into sudden passion, she"
1764,THE THREE VOICES.,In tone of cold malignity:
1765,THE THREE VOICES.,"""To others, yea: but not to thee."""
1766,THE THREE VOICES.,
1767,THE THREE VOICES.,"But when she saw him quail and quake,"
1768,THE THREE VOICES.,"And when he urged ""For pity's sake!"""
1769,THE THREE VOICES.,Once more in gentle tone she spake.
1770,THE THREE VOICES.,
1771,THE THREE VOICES.,"""Thought in the mind doth still abide:"
1772,THE THREE VOICES.,"That is by Intellect supplied,"
1773,THE THREE VOICES.,And within that Idea doth hide:
1774,THE THREE VOICES.,
1775,THE THREE VOICES.,"""And he, that yearns the truth to know,"
1776,THE THREE VOICES.,"Still further inwardly may go,"
1777,THE THREE VOICES.,And find Idea from Notion flow:
1778,THE THREE VOICES.,
1779,THE THREE VOICES.,"""And thus the chain, that sages sought,"
1780,THE THREE VOICES.,"Is to a glorious circle wrought,"
1781,THE THREE VOICES.,"For Notion hath its source in Thought."""
1782,THE THREE VOICES.,
1783,THE THREE VOICES.,So passed they on with even pace:
1784,THE THREE VOICES.,Yet gradually one might trace

1793,THE THREE VOICES.,
1794,THE THREE VOICES.,They walked beside the wave-worn beach;
1795,THE THREE VOICES.,"Her tongue was very apt to teach,"
1796,THE THREE VOICES.,And now and then he did beseech
1797,THE THREE VOICES.,
1798,THE THREE VOICES.,"She would abate her dulcet tone,"
1799,THE THREE VOICES.,"Because the talk was all her own,"
1800,THE THREE VOICES.,And he was dull as any drone.
1801,THE THREE VOICES.,
1802,THE THREE VOICES.,"She urged ""No cheese is made of chalk"":"
1803,THE THREE VOICES.,"And ceaseless flowed her dreary talk,"
1804,THE THREE VOICES.,Tuned to the footfall of a walk.
1805,THE THREE VOICES.,
1806,THE THREE VOICES.,"Her voice was very full and rich,"
1807,THE THREE VOICES.,"And, when at length she asked him ""Which?"""
1808,THE THREE VOICES.,It mounted to its highest pitch.
1809,THE THREE VOICES.,
1810,THE THREE VOICES.,"He a bewildered answer gave,"
1811,THE THREE VOICES.,"Drowned in the sullen moaning wave,"
1812,THE THREE VOICES.,Lost in the echoes of the cave.
1813,THE THREE VOICES.,
1814,THE THREE VOICES.,He answered her he knew not what:
1815,THE THREE VOICES.,"Like shaft from bow at random shot,"
1816,THE THREE VOICES.,"He spoke, but she regarded not."
1817,THE THREE VOICES.,
1818,THE THREE VOICES.,"She waited not for his reply,"
1819,THE THREE VOICES.,But with a downward leaden eye
1820,THE THREE VOICES.,Went on as if he were not by:
1821,THE THREE VOICES.,
1822,THE THREE VOICES.,"Sound argument and grave defence,"
1823,THE THREE VOICES.,"Strange questions raised on ""Why?"" and ""Whence?"""
1824,THE THREE VOICES.,And wildly tangled evidence.
1825,THE THREE VOICES.,
1826,THE THREE VOICES.,"When he, with racked and whirling brain,"
1827,THE THREE VOICES.,"Feebly implored her to explain,"
1828,THE THREE VOICES.,She simply said it all again.
1829,THE THREE VOICES.,
1830,THE THREE VOICES.,"Wrenched with an agony intense,"
1831,THE THREE VOICES.,"He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense,"
1832,THE THREE VOICES.,And careless of all consequence:

1834,THE THREE VOICES.,"""Mind--I believe--is Essence--Ent--"

1838,THE THREE VOICES.,"When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed,"
1839,THE THREE VOICES.,"At length his speech was somewhat hushed,"
1840,THE THREE VOICES.,"She looked at him, and he was crushed."
1841,THE THREE VOICES.,
1842,THE THREE VOICES.,It needed not her calm reply:
1843,THE THREE VOICES.,"She fixed him with a stony eye,"
1844,THE THREE VOICES.,"And he could neither fight nor fly,"
1845,THE THREE VOICES.,
1846,THE THREE VOICES.,"While she dissected, word by word,"
1847,THE THREE VOICES.,"His speech, half guessed at and half heard,"

1852,THE THREE VOICES.,"Then, having wholly overthrown"

1894,THE THREE VOICES.,"Till, like a silent water-mill,"
1895,THE THREE VOICES.,"When summer suns have dried the rill,"

1906,THE THREE VOICES.,"With glance that ever sought the ground,"
1907,THE THREE VOICES.,"She moved her lips without a sound,"

1914,THE THREE VOICES.,"To muse a little space did seem,"
1915,THE THREE VOICES.,"Then, like the echo of a dream,"
1916,THE THREE VOICES.,Harped back upon her threadbare theme.
1917,THE THREE VOICES.,
1918,THE THREE VOICES.,Still an attentive ear he lent
1919,THE THREE VOICES.,But could not fathom what she meant:
1920,THE THREE VOICES.,"She was not deep, nor eloquent."
1921,THE THREE VOICES.,
1922,THE THREE VOICES.,He marked the ripple on the sand:
1923,THE THREE VOICES.,The even swaying of her hand
1924,THE THREE VOICES.,Was all that he could understand.
1925,THE THREE VOICES.,
1926,THE THREE VOICES.,"He saw in dreams a drawing-room,"
