55,I,
56,I,
57,I,"In hawthorn-time the heart grows light,"
58,I,"The world is sweet in sound and sight,"
59,I,"Glad thoughts and birds take flower and flight,"
60,I,"The heather kindles toward the light,"
61,I,The whin is frankincense and flame.
62,I,And be it for strife or be it for love
63,I,The falcon quickens as the dove
64,I,When earth is touched from heaven above
65,I,With joy that knows no name.
66,I,
67,I,And glad in spirit and sad in soul
68,I,With dream and doubt of days that roll
69,I,As waves that race and find no goal
70,I,Rode on by bush and brake and bole
71,I,A northern child of earth and sea.
72,I,The pride of life before him lay
73,I,Radiant: the heavens of night and day
74,I,Shone less than shone before his way
75,I,His ways and days to be.
76,I,
77,I,And all his life of blood and breath
78,I,Sang out within him: time and death
79,I,Were even as words a dreamer saith
80,I,"When sleep within him slackeneth,"
81,I,And light and life and spring were one.
82,I,"The steed between his knees that sprang,"
83,I,"The moors and woods that shone and sang,"
84,I,"The hours where through the spring's breath rang,"
85,I,Seemed ageless as the sun.
86,I,
87,I,But alway through the bounteous bloom
88,I,That earth gives thanks if heaven illume
89,I,"His soul forefelt a shadow of doom,"
90,I,His heart foreknew a gloomier gloom
91,I,"Than closes all men's equal ways,"
92,I,Albeit the spirit of life's light spring
93,I,"With pride of heart upheld him, king"
94,I,And lord of hours like snakes that sting
95,I,And nights that darken days.
96,I,
97,I,And as the strong spring round him grew
98,I,"Stronger, and all blithe winds that blew"
99,I,"Blither, and flowers that flowered anew"
100,I,"More glad of sun and air and dew,"
101,I,The shadow lightened on his soul
102,I,And brightened into death and died
103,I,"Like winter, as the bloom waxed wide"
104,I,From woodside on to riverside
105,I,And southward goal to goal.
106,I,
107,I,"Along the wandering ways of Tyne,"
108,I,By beech and birch and thorn that shine
109,I,And laugh when life's requickening wine
110,I,Makes night and noon and dawn divine
111,I,"And stirs in all the veins of spring,"
112,I,"And past the brightening banks of Tees,"
113,I,He rode as one that breathes and sees
114,I,"A sun more blithe, a merrier breeze,"
115,I,A life that hails him king.
116,I,
117,I,And down the softening south that knows
118,I,"No more how glad the heather glows,"
119,I,"Nor how, when winter's clarion blows"
120,I,"Across the bright Northumbrian snows,"
121,I,"Sea-mists from east and westward meet,"
122,I,Past Avon senseless yet of song
123,I,And Thames that bore but swans in throng
124,I,He rode elate in heart and strong
125,I,In trust of days as sweet.
126,I,
127,I,"So came he through to Camelot,"
128,I,"Glad, though for shame his heart waxed hot,"
129,I,For hope within it withered not
130,I,To see the shaft it dreamed of shot
131,I,"Fair toward the glimmering goal of fame,"
132,I,And all King Arthur's knightliest there
133,I,"Approved him knightly, swift to dare"
134,I,And keen to bid their records bear
135,I,Sir Balen's northern name.
136,I,
137,I,Sir Balen of Northumberland
138,I,Gat grace before the king to stand
139,I,"High as his heart was, and his hand"
140,I,Wrought honour toward the strange north strand
141,I,That sent him south so goodly a knight.
142,I,"And envy, sick with sense of sin,"
143,I,Began as poisonous herbs begin
144,I,"To work in base men's blood, akin"
145,I,To men's of nobler might.
146,I,
147,I,"And even so fell it that his doom,"
148,I,For all his bright life's kindling bloom
149,I,"And light that took no thought for gloom,"
150,I,Fell as a breath from the opening tomb
151,I,Full on him ere he wist or thought.
152,I,"For once a churl of royal seed,"
153,I,"King Arthur's kinsman, faint in deed"
154,I,"And loud in word that knew not heed,"
155,I,Spake shame where shame was nought.
156,I,
157,I,"""What doth one here in Camelot"
158,I,Whose birth was northward?  Wot we not
159,I,As all his brethren borderers wot
160,I,"How blind of heart, how keen and hot,"
161,I,The wild north lives and hates the south?
162,I,Men of the narrowing march that knows
163,I,"Nought save the strength of storms and snows,"
164,I,What would these carles where knighthood blows
165,I,"A trump of kinglike mouth?"""
166,I,
167,I,"Swift from his place leapt Balen, smote"
168,I,"The liar across his face, and wrote"
169,I,His wrath in blood upon the bloat
170,I,Brute cheek that challenged shame for note
171,I,How vile a king-born knave might be.
172,I,"Forth sprang their swords, and Balen slew"
173,I,The knave ere well one witness knew
174,I,Of all that round them stood or drew
175,I,What sight was there to see.
176,I,
177,I,Then spake the great king's wrathful will
178,I,A doom for six dark months to fill
179,I,"Wherein close prison held him, still"
180,I,And steadfast-souled for good or ill.
181,I,But when those weary days lay dead
182,I,His lordliest knights and barons spake
183,I,Before the king for Balen's sake
184,I,"Good speech and wise, of force to break"
185,I,The bonds that bowed his head.
186,I,
187,I,
188,I,
189,II,II
190,II,
191,II,
192,II,In linden-time the heart is high
193,II,For pride of summer passing by
194,II,With lordly laughter in her eye;
195,II,A heavy splendour in the sky
196,II,Uplifts and bows it down again.
197,II,The spring had waned from wood and wold
198,II,Since Balen left his prison hold
199,II,And lowlier-hearted than of old
200,II,Beheld it wax and wane.
201,II,
202,II,Though humble heart and poor array
203,II,Kept not from spirit and sense away
204,II,"Their noble nature, nor could slay"
205,II,The pride they bade but pause and stay
206,II,"Till time should bring its trust to flower,"
207,II,"Yet even for noble shame's sake, born"
208,II,"Of hope that smiled on hate and scorn,"
209,II,He held him still as earth ere morn
210,II,Ring forth her rapturous hour.
211,II,
212,II,But even as earth when dawn takes flight
213,II,And beats her wings of dewy light
214,II,"Full in the faltering face of night,"
215,II,His soul awoke to claim by right
216,II,"The life and death of deed and doom,"
217,II,When once before the king there came
218,II,A maiden clad with grief and shame
219,II,And anguish burning her like flame
220,II,That feeds on flowers in bloom.
221,II,
222,II,"Beneath a royal mantle, fair"
223,II,"With goodly work of lustrous vair,"
224,II,Girt fast against her side she bare
225,II,A sword whose weight bade all men there
226,II,Quail to behold her face again.
227,II,Save of a passing perfect knight
228,II,Not great alone in force and fight
229,II,It might not be for any might
230,II,"Drawn forth, and end her pain."
231,II,
232,II,So said she: then King Arthur spake:
233,II,"""Albeit indeed I dare not take"
234,II,"Such praise on me, for knighthood's sake"
235,II,And love of ladies will I make
236,II,"Assay if better none may be."""
237,II,By girdle and by sheath he caught
238,II,"The sheathed and girded sword, and wrought"
239,II,With strength whose force availed him nought
240,II,To save and set her free.
241,II,
242,II,"Again she spake: ""No need to set"
243,II,The might that man has matched not yet
244,II,Against it: he whose hand shall get
245,II,Grace to release the bonds that fret
246,II,My bosom and my girdlestead
247,II,With little strain of strength or strife
248,II,Shall bring me as from death to life
249,II,And win to sister or to wife
250,II,"Fame that outlives men dead."""
251,II,
252,II,Then bade the king his knights assay
253,II,This mystery that before him lay
254,II,"And mocked his might of manhood.  ""Nay,"""
255,II,"Quoth she, ""the man that takes away"
256,II,This burden laid on me must be
257,II,A knight of record clean and fair
258,II,"As sunlight and the flowerful air,"
259,II,By sire and mother born to bear
260,II,"A name to shame not me."""
261,II,
262,II,"Then forth strode Launcelot, and laid"
263,II,The mighty-moulded hand that made
264,II,Strong knights reel back like birds affrayed
265,II,By storm that smote them as they strayed
266,II,Against the hilt that yielded not.
267,II,"Then Tristram, bright and sad and kind"
268,II,As one that bore in noble mind
269,II,"Love that made light as darkness blind,"
270,II,Fared even as Launcelot.
271,II,
272,II,"Then Lamoracke, with hardier cheer,"
273,II,As one that held all hope and fear
274,II,Wherethrough the spirit of man may steer
275,II,"In life and death less dark or dear,"
276,II,"Laid hand thereon, and fared as they."
277,II,With half a smile his hand he drew
278,II,"Back from the spell-bound thing, and threw"
279,II,With half a glance his heart anew
280,II,Toward no such blameless may.
281,II,
282,II,Between Iseult and Guenevere
283,II,"Sat one of name as high to hear,"
284,II,But darklier doomed than they whose cheer
285,II,Foreshowed not yet the deadlier year
286,II,"That bids the queenliest head bow down,"
287,II,The queen Morgause of Orkney: they
288,II,With scarce a flash of the eye could say
289,II,"The very word of dawn, when day"
290,II,Gives earth and heaven their crown.
291,II,
292,II,But bright and dark as night or noon
293,II,And lowering as a storm-flushed moon
294,II,When clouds and thwarting winds distune
295,II,"The music of the midnight, soon"
296,II,To die from darkening star to star
297,II,And leave a silence in the skies
298,II,"That yearns till dawn find voice and rise,"
299,II,"Shone strange as fate Morgause, with eyes"
300,II,That dwelt on days afar.
301,II,
302,II,A glance that shot on Lamoracke
303,II,As from a storm-cloud bright and black.
304,II,Fire swift and blind as death's own track
305,II,Turned fleet as flame on Arthur back
306,II,From him whose hand forsook the hilt:
307,II,And one in blood and one in sin
308,II,Their hearts caught fire of pain within
309,II,And knew no goal for them to win
310,II,But death that guerdons guilt.
311,II,
312,II,"Then Gawain, sweet of soul and gay"
313,II,"As April ere he dreams of May,"
314,II,"Strove, and prevailed not: then Sir Kay,"
315,II,"The snake-souled envier, vile as they"
316,II,"That fawn and foam and lurk and lie,"
317,II,Sire of the bastard band whose brood
318,II,Was alway found at servile feud
319,II,"With honour, faint and false and lewd,"
320,II,Scarce grasped and put it by.
321,II,
322,II,Then wept for woe the damsel bound
323,II,"With iron and with anguish round,"
324,II,That none to help her grief was found
325,II,Or loose the inextricably inwound
326,II,Grim curse that girt her life with grief
327,II,"And made a burden of her breath,"
328,II,Harsh as the bitterness of death.
329,II,Then spake the king as one that saith
330,II,Words bitterer even than brief.
331,II,
332,II,"""Methought the wide round world could bring"
333,II,Before the face of queen or king
334,II,No knights more fit for fame to sing
335,II,Than fill this full Round Table's ring
336,II,With honour higher than pride of place:
337,II,"But now my heart is wrung to know,"
338,II,"Damsel, that none whom fame can show"
339,II,Finds grace to heal or help thy woe:
340,II,"God gives them not the grace."""
341,II,
342,II,"Then from the lowliest place thereby,"
343,II,With heart-enkindled cheek and eye
344,II,Most like the star and kindling sky
345,II,That say the sundawn's hour is high
346,II,"When rapture trembles through the sea,"
347,II,Strode Balen in his poor array
348,II,"Forth, and took heart of grace to pray"
349,II,The damsel suffer even him to assay
350,II,His power to set her free.
351,II,
352,II,"Nay, how should he avail, she said,"
353,II,"Averse with scorn-averted head,"
354,II,Where these availed not? none had sped
355,II,Of all these mightier men that led
356,II,"The lists wherein he might not ride,"
357,II,"And how should less men speed?  But he,"
358,II,"With lordlier pride of courtesy,"
359,II,Put forth his hand and set her free
360,II,From pain and humbled pride.
361,II,
362,II,But on the sword he gazed elate
363,II,"With hope set higher than fear or fate,"
364,II,Or doubt of darkling days in wait;
365,II,And when her thankful praise waxed great
366,II,"And craved of him the sword again,"
367,II,"He would not give it.  ""Nay, for mine"
368,II,"It is till force may make it thine."""
369,II,A smile that shone as death may shine
370,II,Spake toward him bale and bane.
371,II,
372,II,Strange lightning flickered from her eyes.
373,II,"""Gentle and good in knightliest guise"
374,II,And meet for quest of strange emprise
375,II,Thou hast here approved thee: yet not wise
376,II,"To keep the sword from me, I wis."
377,II,For with it thou shalt surely slay
378,II,Of all that look upon the day
379,II,"The man best loved of thee, and lay"
380,II,"Thine own life down for his."""
381,II,
382,II,"""What chance God sends, that chance I take,"""
383,II,He said.  Then soft and still she spake;
384,II,"""I would but for thine only sake"
385,II,"Have back the sword of thee, and break"
386,II,The links of doom that bind thee round.
387,II,"But seeing thou wilt not have it so,"
388,II,"My heart for thine is wrung with woe."""
389,II,"""God's will,"" quoth he, ""it is, we know,"
390,II,"Wherewith our lives are bound."""
391,II,
392,II,"""Repent it must thou soon,"" she said,"
393,II,"""Who wouldst not hear the rede I read"
394,II,"For thine and not for my sake, sped"
395,II,In vain as waters heavenward shed
396,II,From springs that falter and depart
397,II,Earthward.  God bids not thee believe
398,II,"Truth, and the web thy life must weave"
399,II,For even this sword to close and cleave
400,II,"Hangs heavy round my heart."""
401,II,
402,II,"So passed she mourning forth.  But he,"
403,II,With heart of springing hope set free
404,II,"As birds that breast and brave the sea,"
405,II,Bade horse and arms and armour be
406,II,Made straightway ready toward the fray.
407,II,Nor even might Arthur's royal prayer
408,II,"Withhold him, but with frank and fair"
409,II,Thanksgiving and leave-taking there
410,II,He turned him thence away.
411,II,
412,II,
413,II,
414,III,III
415,III,
416,III,
417,III,"As the east wind, when the morning's breast"
418,III,"Gleams like a bird's that leaves the nest,"
419,III,"A fledgeling halcyon's bound on quest,"
420,III,Drives wave on wave on wave to west
421,III,"Till all the sea be life and light,"
422,III,"So time's mute breath, that brings to bloom"
423,III,"All flowers that strew the dead spring's tomb,"
424,III,Drives day on day on day to doom
425,III,Till all man's day be night.
426,III,
427,III,Brief as the breaking of a wave
428,III,That hurls on man his thunderous grave
429,III,Ere fear find breath to cry or crave
430,III,"Life that no chance may spare or save,"
431,III,The light of joy and glory shone
432,III,Even as in dreams where death seems dead
433,III,"Round Balen's hope-exalted head,"
434,III,"Shone, passed, and lightened as it fled"
435,III,The shadow of doom thereon.
436,III,
437,III,"For as he bound him thence to fare,"
438,III,Before the stately presence there
439,III,"A lady like a windflower fair,"
440,III,Girt on with raiment strange and rare
441,III,"That rippled whispering round her, came."
442,III,"Her clear cold eyes, all glassy grey,"
443,III,Seemed lit not with the light of day
444,III,But touched with gleams that waned away
445,III,Of quelled and fading flame.
446,III,
447,III,Before the king she bowed and spake:
448,III,"""King, for thine old faith's plighted sake"
449,III,"To me the lady of the lake,"
450,III,I come in trust of thee to take
451,III,"The guerdon of the gift I gave,"
452,III,"Thy sword Excalibur.""  And he"
453,III,"Made answer: ""Be it whate'er it be,"
454,III,"If mine to give, I give it thee,"
455,III,"Nor need is thine to crave."""
456,III,
457,III,As when a gleam of wicked light
458,III,Turns half a low-lying water bright
459,III,That moans beneath the shivering night
460,III,With sense of evil sound and sight
461,III,"And whispering witchcraft's bated breath,"
462,III,Her wan face quickened as she said:
463,III,"""This knight that won the sword--his head"
464,III,"I crave or hers that brought it.  Dead,"
465,III,"Let these be one in death."""
466,III,
467,III,"""Not with mine honour this may be;"
468,III,"Ask all save this thou wilt,"" quoth he,"
469,III,"""And have thy full desire.""  But she"
470,III,"Made answer: ""Nought will I of thee,"
471,III,"Nought if not this.""  Then Balen turned,"
472,III,And saw the sorceress hard beside
473,III,By whose fell craft his mother died:
474,III,"Three years he had sought her, and here espied"
475,III,His heart against her yearned.
476,III,
477,III,"""Ill be thou met,"" he said, ""whose ire"
478,III,Would slake with blood thy soul's desire:
479,III,By thee my mother died in fire;
480,III,"Die thou by me a death less dire."""
481,III,"Sharp flashed his sword forth, fleet as flame,"
482,III,And shore away her sorcerous head.
483,III,"""Alas for shame,"" the high king said,"
484,III,"""That one found once my friend lies dead;"
485,III,Alas for all our shame!
486,III,
487,III,"""Thou shouldst have here forborne her; yea,"
488,III,Were all the wrongs that bid men slay
489,III,"Thine, heaped too high for wrath to weigh,"
490,III,Not here before my face today
491,III,"Was thine the right to wreak thy wrong."""
492,III,Still stood he then as one that found
493,III,"His rose of hope by storm discrowned,"
494,III,And all the joy that girt him round
495,III,Brief as a broken song.
496,III,
497,III,Yet ere he passed he turned and spake:
498,III,"""King, only for thy nobler sake"
499,III,Than aught of power man's power may take
500,III,Or pride of place that pride may break
501,III,"I bid the lordlier man in thee,"
502,III,"That lives within the king, give ear."
503,III,This justice done before thee here
504,III,"On one that hell's own heart holds dear,"
505,III,Needs might not this but be.
506,III,
507,III,"""Albeit, for all that pride would prove,"
508,III,"My heart be wrung to lose thy love,"
509,III,It yet repents me not hereof:
510,III,"So many an eagle and many a dove,"
511,III,"So many a knight, so many a may,"
512,III,This water-snake of poisonous tongue
513,III,"To death by words and wiles hath stung,"
514,III,"That her their slayer, from hell's lake sprung,"
515,III,"I did not ill to slay."""
516,III,
517,III,"""Yea,"" said the king, ""too high of heart"
518,III,To stand before a king thou art;
519,III,Yet irks it me to bid thee part
520,III,"And take thy penance for thy part,"
521,III,"That God may put upon thy pride."""
522,III,Then Balen took the severed head
523,III,And toward his hostry turned and sped
524,III,As one that knew not quick from dead
525,III,Nor good from evil tide.
526,III,
527,III,He bade his squire before him stand
528,III,And take that sanguine spoil in hand
529,III,And bear it far by shore and strand
530,III,Till all in glad Northumberland
531,III,"That loved him, seeing it, all might know"
532,III,"His deadliest foe was dead, and hear"
533,III,How free from prison as from fear
534,III,He dwelt in trust of the answering year
535,III,To bring him weal for woe.
536,III,
537,III,"""And tell them, now I take my way"
538,III,"To meet in battle, if I may,"
539,III,"King Ryons of North Wales, and slay"
540,III,That king of kernes whose fiery sway
541,III,Doth all the marches dire despite
542,III,That serve King Arthur: so shall he
543,III,"Again be gracious lord to me,"
544,III,And I that leave thee meet with thee
545,III,"Once more in Arthur's sight."""
546,III,
547,III,"So spake he ere they parted, nor"
548,III,"Took shame or fear to counsellor,"
549,III,As one whom none laid ambush for;
550,III,"And wist not how Sir Launceor,"
551,III,"The wild king's son of Ireland, hot"
552,III,And high in wrath to know that one
553,III,"Stood higher in fame before the sun,"
554,III,"Even Balen, since the sword was won,"
555,III,Drew nigh from Camelot.
556,III,
557,III,"For thence, in heat of hate and pride,"
558,III,"As one that man might bid not bide,"
559,III,He craved the high king's grace to ride
560,III,On quest of Balen far and wide
561,III,And wreak the wrong his wrath had wrought.
562,III,"""Yea,"" Arthur said, ""for such despite"
563,III,Was done me never in my sight
564,III,As this thine hand shall now requite
565,III,"If trust avail us aught."""
566,III,
567,III,"But ere he passed, in eager mood"
568,III,"To feed his hate with bitter food,"
569,III,Before the king's face Merlin stood
570,III,"And heard his tale of ill and good,"
571,III,"Of Balen, and the sword achieved,"
572,III,And whence it smote as heaven's red ire
573,III,That direful dame of doom as dire;
574,III,And how the king's wrath turned to fire
575,III,The grief wherewith he grieved.
576,III,
577,III,"And darkening as he gave it ear,"
578,III,The still face of the sacred seer
579,III,"Waxed wan with wrath and not with fear,"
580,III,And ever changed its cloudier cheer
581,III,Till all his face was very night.
582,III,"""This damosel that brought the sword,"""
583,III,"He said, ""before the king my lord,"
584,III,"And all these knights about his board,"
585,III,Hath done them all despite.
586,III,
587,III,"""The falsest damosel she is"
588,III,"That works men ill on earth, I wis,"
589,III,"And all her mind is toward but this,"
590,III,To kill as with a lying kiss
591,III,"Truth, and the life of noble trust."
592,III,"A brother hath she,--see but now"
593,III,The flame of shame that brands her brow!--
594,III,"A true man, pure as faith's own vow,"
595,III,Whose honour knows not rust.
596,III,
597,III,"""This good knight found within her bower"
598,III,"A felon and her paramour,"
599,III,"And slew him in his shameful hour,"
600,III,As right gave might and righteous power
601,III,To hands that wreaked so foul a wrong.
602,III,"Then, for the hate her heart put on,"
603,III,She sought by ways where death had gone
604,III,"The lady Lyle of Avalon,"
605,III,Whose crafts are strange and strong.
606,III,
607,III,"""The sorceress, one with her in thought,"
608,III,"Gave her that sword of magic, wrought"
609,III,"By charms whereof sweet heaven sees nought,"
610,III,That hither girt on her she brought
611,III,To be by doom her brother's bane.
612,III,And grief it is to think how he
613,III,"That won it, being of heart so free"
614,III,"And perfect found in chivalry,"
615,III,Shall by that sword lie slain.
616,III,
617,III,Great pity it is and strange despite
618,III,That one whose eyes are stars to light
619,III,"Honour, and shine as heaven's own height,"
620,III,"Should perish, being the goodliest knight"
621,III,That even the all-glorious north has borne.
622,III,Nor shall my lord the king behold
623,III,A lordlier friend of mightier mould
624,III,"Than Balen, though his tale be told"
625,III,"Ere noon fulfil his morn."""
626,III,
627,III,
628,III,
629,IV,IV
630,IV,
631,IV,
632,IV,As morning hears before it run
633,IV,"The music of the mounting sun,"
634,IV,And laughs to watch his trophies won
635,IV,"From darkness, and her hosts undone,"
636,IV,"And all the night become a breath,"
637,IV,Nor dreams that fear should hear and flee
638,IV,"The summer menace of the sea,"
639,IV,"So hears our hope what life may be,"
640,IV,And knows it not for death.
641,IV,
642,IV,Each day that slays its hours and dies
643,IV,"Weeps, laughs, and lightens on our eyes,"
644,IV,And sees and hears not: smiles and sighs
645,IV,As flowers ephemeral fall and rise
646,IV,"About its birth, about its way,"
647,IV,"And pass as love and sorrow pass,"
648,IV,"As shadows flashing down a glass,"
649,IV,"As dew-flowers blowing in flowerless grass,"
650,IV,As hope from yesterday.
651,IV,
652,IV,The blossom of the sunny dew
653,IV,That now the stronger sun strikes through
654,IV,Fades off the blade whereon it blew
655,IV,No fleetlier than the flowers that grew
656,IV,On hope's green stem in life's fierce light.
657,IV,Nor might the glory soon to sit
658,IV,Awhile on Balen's crest alit
659,IV,Outshine the shadow of doom on it
660,IV,Or stay death's wings from flight.
661,IV,
662,IV,Dawn on a golden moorland side
663,IV,By holt and heath saw Balen ride
664,IV,"And Launceor after, pricked with pride"
665,IV,And stung with spurring envy: wide
666,IV,And far he had ridden athwart strange lands
667,IV,And sought amiss the man he found
668,IV,"And cried on, till the stormy sound"
669,IV,Rang as a rallying trumpet round
670,IV,That fires men's hearts and hands.
671,IV,
672,IV,Abide he bade him: nor was need
673,IV,To bid when Balen wheeled his steed
674,IV,"Fiercely, less fain by word than deed"
675,IV,"To bid his envier evil speed,"
676,IV,"And cried, ""What wilt thou with me?""  Loud"
677,IV,"Rang Launceor's vehement answer: ""Knight,"
678,IV,To avenge on thee the dire despite
679,IV,Thou hast done us all in Arthur's sight
680,IV,"I stand toward Arthur vowed."""
681,IV,
682,IV,"""Ay?"" Balen said: ""albeit I see"
683,IV,"I needs must deal in strife with thee,"
684,IV,Light is the wyte thou layest on me;
685,IV,"For her I slew and sinned not, she"
686,IV,"Was dire in all men's eyes as death,"
687,IV,Or none were lother found than I
688,IV,By me to bid a woman die:
689,IV,"As lief were loyal men to lie,"
690,IV,"Or scorn what honour saith."""
691,IV,
692,IV,As the arched wave's weight against the reef
693,IV,"Hurls, and is hurled back like a leaf"
694,IV,"Storm-shrivelled, and its rage of grief"
695,IV,"Speaks all the loud broad sea in brief,"
696,IV,"And quells the hearkening hearts of men,"
697,IV,Or as the crash of overfalls
698,IV,Down under blue smooth water brawls
699,IV,"Like jarring steel on ruining walls,"
700,IV,So rang their meeting then.
701,IV,
702,IV,"As wave on wave shocks, and confounds"
703,IV,The bounding bulk whereon it bounds
704,IV,And breaks and shattering seaward sounds
705,IV,As crying of the old sea's wolves and hounds
706,IV,"That moan and ravin and rage and wail,"
707,IV,So steed on steed encountering sheer
708,IV,"Shocked, and the strength of Launceor's spear"
709,IV,"Shivered on Balen's shield, and fear"
710,IV,Bade hope within him quail.
711,IV,
712,IV,But Balen's spear through Launceor's shield
713,IV,Clove as a ploughshare cleaves the field
714,IV,"And pierced the hauberk triple-steeled,"
715,IV,"That horse with horseman stricken reeled,"
716,IV,"And as a storm-breached rock falls, fell."
717,IV,And Balen turned his horse again
718,IV,"And wist not yet his foe lay slain,"
719,IV,And saw him dead that sought his bane
720,IV,And wrought and fared not well.
721,IV,
722,IV,"Suddenly, while he gazed and stood,"
723,IV,And mused in many-minded mood
724,IV,"If life or death were evil or good,"
725,IV,Forth of a covert of a wood
726,IV,That skirted half the moorland lea
727,IV,Fast rode a maiden flower-like white
728,IV,"Full toward that fair wild place of fight,"
729,IV,Anhungered of the woful sight
730,IV,God gave her there to see.
731,IV,
732,IV,"And seeing the man there fallen and dead,"
733,IV,She cried against the sun that shed
734,IV,"Light on the living world, and said,"
735,IV,"""O Balen, slayer whose hand is red,"
736,IV,"Two bodies and one heart thou hast slain,"
737,IV,"Two hearts within one body: aye,"
738,IV,"Two souls thou hast lost; by thee they die,"
739,IV,Cast out of sight of earth and sky
740,IV,"And all that made them fain."""
741,IV,
742,IV,"And from the dead his sword she caught,"
743,IV,"And fell in trance that wist of nought,"
744,IV,Swooning: but softly Balen sought
745,IV,To win from her the sword she thought
746,IV,"To die on, dying by Launceor's side."
747,IV,Again her wakening wail outbroke
748,IV,"As wildly, sword in hand, she woke"
749,IV,And struck one swift and bitter stroke
750,IV,"That healed her, and she died."
751,IV,
752,IV,And sorrowing for their strange love's sake
753,IV,"Rode Balen forth by lawn and lake,"
754,IV,"By moor and moss and briar and brake,"
755,IV,And in his heart their sorrow spake
756,IV,"Whose lips were dumb as death, and said"
757,IV,Mute words of presage blind and vain
758,IV,As rain-stars blurred and marred by rain
759,IV,To wanderers on a moonless main
760,IV,Where night and day seem dead.
761,IV,
762,IV,Then toward a sunbright wildwood side
763,IV,He looked and saw beneath it ride
764,IV,A knight whose arms afar espied
765,IV,By note of name and proof of pride
766,IV,"Bare witness of his brother born,"
767,IV,"His brother Balan, hard at hand,"
768,IV,"Twin flower of bright Northumberland,"
769,IV,"Twin sea-bird of their loud sea-strand,"
770,IV,Twin song-bird of their morn.
771,IV,
772,IV,Ah then from Balen passed away
773,IV,"All dread of night, all doubt of day,"
774,IV,"All care what life or death might say,"
775,IV,All thought of all worse months than May:
776,IV,Only the might of joy in love
777,IV,"Brake forth within him as a fire,"
778,IV,And deep delight in deep desire
779,IV,Of far-flown days whose full-souled quire
780,IV,Rang round from the air above.
781,IV,
782,IV,From choral earth and quiring air
783,IV,Rang memories winged like songs that bear
784,IV,Sweet gifts for spirit and sense to share:
785,IV,For no man's life knows love more fair
786,IV,And fruitful of memorial things
787,IV,Than this the deep dear love that breaks
788,IV,"With sense of life on life, and makes"
789,IV,The sundawn sunnier as it wakes
790,IV,Where morning round it rings.
791,IV,
792,IV,"""O brother, O my brother!"" cried"
793,IV,"Each upon each, and cast aside"
794,IV,Their helms unbraced that might not hide
795,IV,From sight of memory single-eyed
796,IV,"The likeness graven of face and face,"
797,IV,And kissed and wept upon each other
798,IV,"For joy and pity of either brother,"
799,IV,"And love engrafted by sire and mother,"
800,IV,God's natural gift of grace.
801,IV,
802,IV,And each with each took counsel meet
803,IV,"For comfort, making sorrow sweet,"
804,IV,And grief a goodly thing to greet:
805,IV,And word from word leapt light and fleet
806,IV,"Till all the venturous tale was told,"
807,IV,And how in Balen's hope it lay
808,IV,"To meet the wild Welsh king and slay,"
809,IV,And win from Arthur back for pay
810,IV,The grace he gave of old.
811,IV,
812,IV,"""And thither will not thou with me"
813,IV,"And win as great a grace for thee?"""
814,IV,"""That will I well,"" quoth Balan: ""we"
815,IV,"Will cleave together, bound and free,"
816,IV,"As brethren should, being twain and one."""
817,IV,But ere they parted thence there came
818,IV,"A creature withered as with flame,"
819,IV,"A dwarf mismade in nature's shame,"
820,IV,Between them and the sun.
821,IV,
822,IV,And riding fleet as fire may glide
823,IV,"He found the dead lie side by side,"
824,IV,"And wailed and rent his hair and cried,"
825,IV,"""Who hath done this deed?""  And Balen eyed"
826,IV,"The strange thing loathfully, and said,"
827,IV,"""The knight I slew, who found him fain"
828,IV,"And keen to slay me: seeing him slain,"
829,IV,"The maid I sought to save in vain,"
830,IV,"Self-stricken, here lies dead."
831,IV,
832,IV,"""Sore grief was mine to see her die,"
833,IV,And for her true faith's sake shall I
834,IV,"Love, and with love of heart more high,"
835,IV,"All women better till I die."""
836,IV,"""Alas,"" the dwarf said, ""ill for thee"
837,IV,In evil hour this deed was done:
838,IV,For now the quest shall be begun
839,IV,"Against thee, from the dawning sun"
840,IV,Even to the sunset sea.
841,IV,
842,IV,"""From shore to mountain, dawn to night,"
843,IV,The kinsfolk of this great dead knight
844,IV,"Will chase thee to thy death.""  A light"
845,IV,Of swift blithe scorn flashed answer bright
846,IV,"As fire from Balen's eye.  ""For that,"
847,IV,"Small fear shall fret my heart,"" quoth he:"
848,IV,"""But that my lord the king should be"
849,IV,"For this dead man's sake wroth with me,"
850,IV,"Weep might it well thereat."""
851,IV,
852,IV,"Then murmuring passed the dwarf away,"
853,IV,And toward the knights in fair array
854,IV,Came riding eastward up the way
855,IV,From where the flower-soft lowlands lay
856,IV,A king whose name the sweet south-west
857,IV,"Held high in honour, and the land"
858,IV,That bowed beneath his gentle hand
859,IV,Wore on its wild bright northern strand
860,IV,Tintagel for a crest.
861,IV,
862,IV,And Balen hailed with homage due
863,IV,"King Mark of Cornwall, when he knew"
864,IV,The pennon that before him flew:
865,IV,And for those lovers dead and true
866,IV,The king made moan to hear their doom;
867,IV,And for their sorrow's sake he sware
868,IV,To seek in all the marches there
869,IV,The church that man might find most fair
870,IV,And build therein their tomb.
871,IV,
872,IV,
873,IV,
874,V,V
875,V,
876,V,
877,V,"As thought from thought takes wing and flies,"
878,V,As month on month with sunlit eyes
879,V,"Tramples and triumphs in its rise,"
880,V,"As wave smites wave to death and dies,"
881,V,So chance on hurtling chance like steel
882,V,"Strikes, flashes, and is quenched, ere fear"
883,V,"Can whisper hope, or hope can hear,"
884,V,If sorrow or joy be far or near
885,V,For time to hurt or heal.
886,V,
887,V,Swift as a shadow and strange as light
888,V,That cleaves in twain the shadow of night
889,V,Before the wide-winged word takes flight
890,V,That thunder speaks to depth and height
891,V,"And quells the quiet hour with sound,"
892,V,There came before King Mark and stood
893,V,Between the moorside and the wood
894,V,"The man whose word God's will made good,"
895,V,Nor guile was in it found.
896,V,
897,V,"And Merlin said to Balen: ""Lo,"
898,V,Thou hast wrought thyself a grievous woe
899,V,"To let this lady die, and know"
900,V,"Thou mightst have stayed her deadly blow."""
901,V,"And Balen answered him and said,"
902,V,"""Nay, by my truth to faith, not I,"
903,V,So fiercely fain she was to die;
904,V,"Ere well her sword had flashed on high,"
905,V,"Self-slain she lay there dead."""
906,V,
907,V,Again and sadly Merlin spake:
908,V,"""My heart is wrung for this deed's sake,"
909,V,To know thee therefore doomed to take
910,V,"Upon thine hand a curse, and make"
911,V,"Three kingdoms pine through twelve years' change,"
912,V,In want and woe: for thou shalt smite
913,V,The man most noble and truest knight
914,V,That looks upon the live world's light
915,V,A dolorous stroke and strange.
916,V,
917,V,"""And not till years shall round their goal"
918,V,"May this man's wound thou hast given be whole."""
919,V,"And Balen, stricken through the soul"
920,V,"By dark-winged words of doom and dole,"
921,V,"Made answer: ""If I wist it were"
922,V,"No lie but sooth thou sayest of me,"
923,V,Then even to make a liar of thee
924,V,"Would I too slay myself, and see"
925,V,"How death bids dead men fare."""
926,V,
927,V,And Merlin took his leave and passed
928,V,And was not: and the shadow as fast
929,V,"Went with him that his word had cast,"
930,V,Too fleet for thought thereof to last:
931,V,And there those brethren bade King Mark
932,V,Farewell: but fain would Mark have known
933,V,The strong knight's name who had overthrown
934,V,"The pride of Launceor, when it shone"
935,V,Bright as it now lay dark.
936,V,
937,V,"And Balan for his brother spake,"
938,V,"Saying: ""Sir, albeit him list not break"
939,V,"The seal of secret time, nor shake"
940,V,"Night off him ere his morning wake,"
941,V,By these two swords he is girt withal
942,V,"May men that praise him, knights and lords,"
943,V,"Call him the knight that bears two swords,"
944,V,And all the praise his fame accords
945,V,"Make answer when they call."""
946,V,
947,V,So parted they toward eventide;
948,V,"And tender twilight, heavy-eyed,"
949,V,Saw deep down glimmering woodlands ride
950,V,"Balen and Balan side by side,"
951,V,Till where the leaves grew dense and dim
952,V,Again they spied from far draw near
953,V,"The presence of the sacred seer,"
954,V,But so disguised and strange of cheer
955,V,That seeing they knew not him.
956,V,
957,V,"""Now whither ride ye,"" Merlin said,"
958,V,"""Through shadows that the sun strikes red,"
959,V,"Ere night be born or day be dead?"""
960,V,"But they, for doubt half touched with dread,"
961,V,Would say not where their goal might lie.
962,V,"""And thou,"" said Balen, ""what art thou,"
963,V,"To walk with shrouded eye and brow?"""
964,V,"He said: ""Me lists not show thee now"
965,V,"By name what man am I."""
966,V,
967,V,"""Ill seen is this of thee,"" said they,"
968,V,"""That thou art true in word and way"
969,V,"Nor fain to fear the face of day,"
970,V,Who wilt not as a true man say
971,V,"The name it shames not him to bear."""
972,V,"He answered: ""Be it or be it not so,"
973,V,"Yet why ye ride this way I know,"
974,V,"To meet King Ryons as a foe,"
975,V,And how your hope shall fare.
976,V,
977,V,"""Well, if ye hearken toward my rede,"
978,V,"Ill, if ye hear not, shall ye speed."""
979,V,"""Ah, now,"" they cried, ""thou art ours at need"
980,V,"What Merlin saith we are fain to heed."""
981,V,"""Great worship shall ye win,"" said he,"
982,V,"""And look that ye do knightly now,"
983,V,"For great shall be your need, I trow."""
984,V,"And Balen smiled: ""By knighthood's vow,"
985,V,"The best we may will we."""
986,V,
987,V,Then Merlin bade them turn and take
988,V,"Rest, for their good steeds' weary sake,"
989,V,"Between the highway and the brake,"
990,V,Till starry midnight bade them wake:
991,V,"Then ""Rise,"" he said, ""the king is nigh,"
992,V,Who hath stolen from all his host away
993,V,"With threescore horse in armed array,"
994,V,The goodliest knights that bear his sway
995,V,And hold his kingdom high.
996,V,
997,V,"""And twenty ride of them before"
998,V,"To bear his errand, ere the door"
999,V,"Turn of the night, sealed fast no more,"
1000,V,And sundawn bid the stars wax hoar;
1001,V,For by the starshine of to-night
1002,V,He seeks a leman where she waits
1003,V,"His coming, dark and swift as fate's,"
1004,V,And hearkens toward the unopening gates
1005,V,That yield not him to sight.
1006,V,
1007,V,Then through the glimmering gloom around
1008,V,A shadowy sense of light and sound
1009,V,"Made, ere the proof thereof were found,"
1010,V,"The brave blithe hearts within them bound,"
1011,V,"And ""Where,"" quoth Balen, ""rides the king?"""
1012,V,"But softer spake the seer: ""Abide,"
1013,V,"Till hither toward your spears he ride,"
1014,V,Where all the narrowing woodland side
1015,V,"Grows dense with boughs that cling."""
1016,V,
1017,V,There in that straitening way they met
1018,V,"The wild Welsh host against them set,"
1019,V,"And smote their strong king down, ere yet"
1020,V,His hurrying horde of spears might get
1021,V,Fierce vantage of them.  Then the fight
1022,V,"Grew great and joyous as it grew,"
1023,V,"For left and right those brethren slew,"
1024,V,Till all the lawn waxed red with dew
1025,V,More deep than dews of night.
1026,V,
1027,V,And ere the full fierce tale was read
1028,V,"Full forty lay before them dead,"
1029,V,And fast the hurtling remnant fled
1030,V,And wist not whither fear had led:
1031,V,"And toward the king they went again,"
1032,V,And would have slain him: but he bowed
1033,V,"Before them, crying in fear aloud"
1034,V,"For grace they gave him, seeing the proud"
1035,V,Wild king brought lowest of men.
1036,V,
1037,V,And ere the wildwood leaves were stirred
1038,V,"With song or wing of wakening bird,"
1039,V,In Camelot was Merlin's word
1040,V,With joy in joyous wonder heard
1041,V,That told of Arthur's bitterest foe
1042,V,Diskingdomed and discomfited.
1043,V,"""By whom?"" the high king smiled and said."
1044,V,"He answered: ""Ere the dawn wax red,"
1045,V,To-morrow bids you know.
1046,V,
1047,V,"""Two knights whose heart and hope are one"
1048,V,And fain to win your grace have done
1049,V,This work whereby if grace be won
1050,V,Their hearts shall hail the enkindling sun
1051,V,"With joy more keen and deep than day."""
1052,V,And ere the sundawn drank the dew
1053,V,Those brethren with their prisoner drew
1054,V,To the outer guard they gave him to
1055,V,And passed again away.
1056,V,
1057,V,And Arthur came as toward his guest
1058,V,"To greet his foe, and bade him rest"
1059,V,As one returned from nobler quest
1060,V,"And welcome from the stormbright west,"
1061,V,But by what chance he fain would hear.
1062,V,"""The chance was hard and strange, sir king,"""
1063,V,"Quoth Ryons, bowed in thanksgiving."
1064,V,"""Who won you?"" Arthur said: ""the thing"
1065,V,"Is worth a warrior's ear."""
1066,V,
1067,V,"The wild king flushed with pride and shame,"
1068,V,"Answering: ""I know not either name"
1069,V,Of those that there against us came
1070,V,And withered all our strength like flame:
1071,V,"The knight that bears two swords is one,"
1072,V,And one his brother: not on earth
1073,V,May men meet men of knightlier worth
1074,V,Nor mightier born of mortal birth
1075,V,"That hail the sovereign sun."""
1076,V,
1077,V,"And Arthur said: ""I know them not"
1078,V,"But much am I for this, God wet,"
1079,V,Beholden to them: Launcelot
1080,V,"Nor Tristram, when the war waxed hot"
1081,V,"Along the marches east and west,"
1082,V,"Wrought ever nobler work than this."""
1083,V,"""Ah,"" Merlin said, ""sore pity it is"
1084,V,"And strange mischance of doom, I wis,"
1085,V,That death should mar their quest.
1086,V,
1087,V,"""Balen, the perfect knight that won"
1088,V,"The sword whose name is malison,"
1089,V,"And made his deed his doom, is one:"
1090,V,Nor hath his brother Balan done
1091,V,Less royal service: not on earth
1092,V,"Lives there a nobler knight, more strong"
1093,V,"Of soul to win men's praise in song,"
1094,V,Albeit the light abide not long
1095,V,That lightened round his birth.
1096,V,
1097,V,"""Yea, and of all sad things I know"
1098,V,The heaviest and the highest in woe
1099,V,"Is this, the doom whose date brings low"
1100,V,Too soon in timeless overthrow
1101,V,"A head so high, a hope so sure."
1102,V,The greatest moan for any knight
1103,V,That ever won fair fame in fight
1104,V,"Shall be for Balen, seeing his might"
1105,V,"Must now not long endure."""
1106,V,
1107,V,"""Alas,"" King Arthur said, ""he hath shown"
1108,V,Such love to me-ward that the moan
1109,V,Made of him should be mine alone
1110,V,"Above all other, knowing it known"
1111,V,"I have ill deserved it of him.""  ""Nay,"""
1112,V,"Said Merlin, ""he shall do for you"
1113,V,"Much more, when time shall be anew,"
1114,V,Than time hath given him chance to do
1115,V,Or hope may think to say.
1116,V,
1117,V,"""But now must be your powers purveyed"
1118,V,"To meet, ere noon of morn be made"
1119,V,"To-morrow, all the host arrayed"
1120,V,"Of this wild foe's wild brother, laid"
1121,V,"Around against you: see to it well,"
1122,V,"For now I part from you.""  And soon,"
1123,V,"When sundawn slew the withering moon,"
1124,V,Two hosts were met to win the boon
1125,V,Whose tale is death's to tell.
1126,V,
1127,V,A lordly tale of knights and lords
1128,V,For death to tell by count of swords
1129,V,When war's wild harp in all its chords
1130,V,"Rang royal triumph, and the hordes"
1131,V,Of hurtling foemen rocked and reeled
1132,V,"As waves wind-thwarted on the sea,"
1133,V,"Was told of all that there might be,"
1134,V,Till scarce might battle hear or see
1135,V,The fortune of the field.
1136,V,
1137,V,And many a knight won fame that day
1138,V,When even the serpent soul of Kay
1139,V,Was kindled toward the fiery play
1140,V,"As might a lion's be for prey,"
1141,V,And won him fame that might not die
1142,V,With passing of his rancorous breath
1143,V,But clung about his life and death
1144,V,"As fire that speaks in cloud, and saith"
1145,V,What strong men hear and fly.
1146,V,
1147,V,"And glorious works were Arthur's there,"
1148,V,That lit the battle-darkened air:
1149,V,But when they saw before them fare
1150,V,Like stars of storm the knight that bare
1151,V,"Two swords about him girt for fray,"
1152,V,"Balen, and Balan with him, then"
1153,V,Strong wonder smote the souls of men
1154,V,If heaven's own host or hell's deep den
1155,V,Had sent them forth to slay.
1156,V,
1157,V,"So keen they rode across the fight,"
1158,V,"So sharp they smote to left and right,"
1159,V,And made of hurtling darkness light
1160,V,"With lightning of their swords, till flight"
1161,V,"And fear before them flew like flame,"
1162,V,"That Arthur's self had never known,"
1163,V,"He said, since first his blast was blown,"
1164,V,Such lords of war as these alone
1165,V,That whence he knew not came.
1166,V,
1167,V,But while the fire of war waxed hot
1168,V,"The wild king hearkened, hearing not,"
1169,V,"Through storm of spears and arrow-shot,"
1170,V,For succour toward him from King Lot
1171,V,"And all his host of sea-born men,"
1172,V,Strong as the strong storm-baffling bird
1173,V,Whose cry round Orkney's headlands heard
1174,V,Is as the sea's own sovereign word
1175,V,That mocks our mortal ken.
1176,V,
1177,V,"For Merlin's craft of prophecy,"
1178,V,"Who wist that one of twain must die,"
1179,V,Put might in him to say thereby
1180,V,"Which head should lose its crown, and lie"
1181,V,"Stricken, though loth he were to know"
1182,V,That either life should wane and fail;
1183,V,"Yet most might Arthur's love avail,"
1184,V,And still with subtly tempered tale
1185,V,His wile held fast the foe.
1186,V,
1187,V,With woven words of magic might
1188,V,Wherein the subtle shadow and light
1189,V,"Changed hope and fear till fear took flight,"
1190,V,He stayed King Lot's fierce lust of fight
1191,V,Till all the wild Welsh war was driven
1192,V,As foam before the wind that wakes
1193,V,"With the all-awakening sun, and breaks"
1194,V,Strong ships that rue the mirth it makes
1195,V,When grace to slay is given.
1196,V,
1197,V,"And ever hotter lit and higher,"
1198,V,"As fire that meets encountering fire,"
1199,V,Waxed in King Lot his keen desire
1200,V,To bid revenge within him tire
1201,V,On Arthur's ravaged fame and life:
1202,V,Across the waves of war between
1203,V,"Floated and flashed, unseen and seen,"
1204,V,The lustrous likeness of the queen
1205,V,Whom shame had sealed his wife.
1206,V,
1207,V,But when the woful word was brought
1208,V,"That while he tarried, doubting nought,"
1209,V,The hope was lost whose goal he sought
1210,V,"And all the fight he yearned for fought,"
1211,V,"His heart was rent for grief and shame,"
1212,V,And half his hope was set on flight
1213,V,Till word was given him of a knight
1214,V,"Who said: ""They are weary and worn with fight,"
1215,V,"And we more fresh than flame."""
1216,V,
1217,V,And bright and dark as night and day
1218,V,Ere either find the unopening way
1219,V,"Clear, and forego the unaltering sway,"
1220,V,"The sad king's face shone, frowning: ""Yea,"
1221,V,I would that every knight of mine
1222,V,"Would do his part as I shall do,"""
1223,V,"He said, ""till death or life anew"
1224,V,Shall judge between us as is due
1225,V,"With wiser doom than thine."""
1226,V,
1227,V,Then thundered all the awakening field
1228,V,"With crash of hosts that clashed and reeled,"
1229,V,"Banner to banner, shield to shield,"
1230,V,"And spear to splintering spear-shaft, steeled"
1231,V,"As heart against high heart of man,"
1232,V,As hope against high hope of knight
1233,V,To pluck the crest and crown of fight
1234,V,"From war's clenched hand by storm's wild light,"
1235,V,For blessing given or ban.
1236,V,
1237,V,All hearts of hearkening men that heard
1238,V,"The ban twin-born with blessing, stirred"
1239,V,"Like springtide waters, knew the word"
1240,V,Whereby the steeds of storm are spurred
1241,V,"With ravenous rapture to destroy,"
1242,V,"And laughed for love of battle, pierced"
1243,V,With passion of tempestuous thirst
1244,V,And hungering hope to assuage it first
1245,V,With draughts of stormy joy.
1246,V,
1247,V,But sheer ahead of the iron tide
1248,V,That rocked and roared from side to side
1249,V,Rode as the lightning's lord might ride
1250,V,"King Lot, whose heart was set to abide"
1251,V,"All peril of the raging hour,"
1252,V,And all his host of warriors born
1253,V,Where lands by warring seas are worn
1254,V,Was only by his hands upborne
1255,V,Who gave them pride and power.
1256,V,
1257,V,But as the sea's hand smites the shore
1258,V,And shatters all the strengths that bore
1259,V,"The ravage earth may bear no more,"
1260,V,So smote the hand of Pellinore
1261,V,"Charging, a knight of Arthur's chief,"
1262,V,"And clove his strong steed's neck in twain,"
1263,V,"And smote him sheer through brow and brain,"
1264,V,"Falling: and there King Lot lay slain,"
1265,V,And knew not wrath or grief.
1266,V,
1267,V,"And all the host of Orkney fled,"
1268,V,And many a mother's son lay dead:
1269,V,But when they raised the stricken head
1270,V,Whence pride and power and shame were fled
1271,V,"And rage and anguish now cast out,"
1272,V,"And bore it toward a kingly tomb,"
1273,V,The wife whose love had wrought his doom
1274,V,"Came thither, fair as morning's bloom"
1275,V,And dark as twilight's doubt.
1276,V,
1277,V,"And there her four strong sons and his,"
1278,V,"Gawain and Gareth, Gaherys"
1279,V,"And Agravain, whose sword's sharp kiss"
1280,V,With sound of hell's own serpent's hiss
1281,V,"Should one day turn her life to death,"
1282,V,Stood mourning with her: but by these
1283,V,"Seeing Mordred as a seer that sees,"
1284,V,Anguish of terror bent her knees
1285,V,And caught her shuddering breath.
1286,V,
1287,V,The splendour of her sovereign eyes
1288,V,Flashed darkness deeper than the skies
1289,V,Feel or fear when the sunset dies
1290,V,On his that felt as midnight rise
1291,V,"Their doom upon them, there undone"
1292,V,By faith in fear ere thought could yield
1293,V,"A shadowy sense of days revealed,"
1294,V,"The ravin of the final field,"
1295,V,The terror of their son.
1296,V,
1297,V,"For Arthur's, as they caught the light"
1298,V,"That sought and durst not seek his sight,"
1299,V,"Darkened, and all his spirit's might"
1300,V,Withered within him even as night
1301,V,Withers when sunrise thrills the sea.
1302,V,But Mordred's lightened as with fire
1303,V,That smote his mother and his sire
1304,V,With darkling doom and deep desire
1305,V,That bade its darkness be.
1306,V,
1307,V,And heavier on their hearts the weight
1308,V,"Sank of the fear that brings forth fate,"
1309,V,The bitter doubt whose womb is great
1310,V,With all the grief and love and hate
1311,V,That turn to fire men's days on earth.
1312,V,"And glorious was the funeral made,"
1313,V,And dark the deepening dread that swayed
1314,V,Their darkening souls whose light grew shade
1315,V,With sense of death in birth.
1316,V,
1317,V,
1318,V,
1319,VI,VI
1320,VI,
1321,VI,
1322,VI,"In autumn, when the wind and sea"
1323,VI,"Rejoice to live and laugh to be,"
1324,VI,And scarce the blast that curbs the tree
1325,VI,And bids before it quail and flee
1326,VI,"The fiery foliage, where its brand"
1327,VI,"Is radiant as the seal of spring,"
1328,VI,"Sounds less delight, and waves a wing"
1329,VI,"Less lustrous, life's loud thanksgiving"
1330,VI,Puts life in sea and land.
1331,VI,
1332,VI,High hope in Balen's heart alight
1333,VI,"Laughed, as from all that clamorous fight"
1334,VI,"He passed and sought not Arthur's sight,"
1335,VI,Who fain had found his kingliest knight
1336,VI,And made amend for Balen's wrong.
1337,VI,But Merlin gave his soul to see
1338,VI,"Fate, rising as a shoreward sea,"
1339,VI,And all the sorrow that should be
1340,VI,Ere hope or fear thought long.
1341,VI,
1342,VI,"""O where are they whose hands upbore"
1343,VI,"My battle,"" Arthur said, ""before"
1344,VI,The wild Welsh host's wide rage and roar?
1345,VI,"Balen and Balan, Pellinore,"
1346,VI,"Where are they?""  Merlin answered him:"
1347,VI,"""Balen shall be not long away"
1348,VI,"From sight of you, but night nor day"
1349,VI,Shall bring his brother back to say

1351,VI,
1352,VI,"""Now, by my faith,"" said Arthur then,"
1353,VI,"""Two marvellous knights are they, whose ken"
1354,VI,"Toward battle makes the twain as ten,"
1355,VI,And Balen most of all born men
1356,VI,Passeth of prowess all I know
1357,VI,Or ever found or sought to see:
1358,VI,"Would God he would abide with me,"
1359,VI,To face the times foretold of thee
1360,VI,"And all the latter woe."""
1361,VI,
1362,VI,For there had Merlin shown the king
1363,VI,"The doom that songs unborn should sing,"
1364,VI,The gifts that time should rise and bring
1365,VI,Of blithe and bitter days to spring
1366,VI,As weeds and flowers against the sun.
1367,VI,And on the king for fear's sake fell
1368,VI,"Sickness, and sorrow deep as hell,"
1369,VI,Nor even might sleep bid fear farewell
1370,VI,If grace to sleep were won.
1371,VI,
1372,VI,Down in a meadow green and still
1373,VI,He bade the folk that wrought his will
1374,VI,"Pitch his pavilion, where the chill"
1375,VI,Soft night would let not rest fulfil
1376,VI,His heart wherein dark fears lay deep.
1377,VI,And sharp against his hearing cast
1378,VI,Came a sound as of horsehoofs fast
1379,VI,"Passing, that ere their sound were past"
1380,VI,Aroused him as from sleep.
1381,VI,
1382,VI,And forth he looked along the grass
1383,VI,And saw before his portal pass
1384,VI,"A knight that wailed aloud, ""Alas"
1385,VI,That life should find this dolorous pass
1386,VI,"And find no shield from doom and dole!"""
1387,VI,"And hearing all his moan, ""Abide,"
1388,VI,"Fair sir,"" the king arose and cried,"
1389,VI,"""And say what sorrow bids you ride"
1390,VI,"So sorrowful of soul."""
1391,VI,
1392,VI,"""My hurt may no man heal, God wot,"
1393,VI,"And help of man may speed me not,"""
1394,VI,"The sad knight said, ""nor change my lot."""
1395,VI,And toward the castle of Melyot
1396,VI,Whose towers arose a league away
1397,VI,"He passed forth sorrowing: and anon,"
1398,VI,"Ere well the woful sight were gone,"
1399,VI,"Came Balen down the meads that shone,"
1400,VI,"Strong, bright, and brave as day."
1401,VI,
1402,VI,"And seeing the king there stand, the knight"
1403,VI,Drew rein before his face to alight
1404,VI,In reverence made for love's sake bright
1405,VI,With joy that set his face alight
1406,VI,"As theirs who see, alive, above,"
1407,VI,"The sovereign of their souls, whose name"
1408,VI,To them is even as love's own flame
1409,VI,To enkindle hope that heeds not fame
1410,VI,And knows no lord but love.
1411,VI,
1412,VI,"And Arthur smiled on him, and said,"
1413,VI,"""Right welcome be thou: by my head,"
1414,VI,I would not wish me better sped.
1415,VI,For even but now there came and fled
1416,VI,Before me like a cloud that flies
1417,VI,"A knight that made most heavy cheer,"
1418,VI,I know not wherefore; nor may fear
1419,VI,Or pity give my heart to hear
1420,VI,Or lighten on mine eyes.
1421,VI,
1422,VI,"""But even for fear's and pity's sake"
1423,VI,Fain were I thou shouldst overtake
1424,VI,And fetch again this knight that spake
1425,VI,No word of answering grace to make
1426,VI,"Reply to mine that hailed him: thou,"
1427,VI,"By force or by goodwill, shalt bring"
1428,VI,"His face before me.""  ""Yea, my king,"""
1429,VI,"Quoth Balen, ""and a greater thing"
1430,VI,Were less than is my vow.
1431,VI,
1432,VI,"""I would the task required and heard"
1433,VI,Were heavier than your sovereign word
1434,VI,"Hath laid on me:"" and thence he spurred"
1435,VI,"Elate at heart as youth, and stirred"
1436,VI,With hope as blithe as fires a boy:
1437,VI,"And many a mile he rode, and found"
1438,VI,Far in a forest's glimmering bound
1439,VI,The man he sought afar around
1440,VI,And seeing took fire for joy.
1441,VI,
1442,VI,"And with him went a maiden, fair"
1443,VI,As flowers aflush with April air.
1444,VI,And Balen bade him turn him there
1445,VI,To tell the king what woes they were
1446,VI,That bowed him down so sore: and he
1447,VI,"Made woeful answer: ""This should do"
1448,VI,"Great scathe to me, with nought for you"
1449,VI,Of help that hope might hearken to
1450,VI,"For boot that may not be."""
1451,VI,
1452,VI,"And Balen answered: ""I were loth"
1453,VI,To fight as one perforce made wroth
1454,VI,With one that owes by knighthood's oath
1455,VI,"One love, one service, and one troth"
1456,VI,With me to him whose gracious hand
1457,VI,Holds fast the helm of knighthood here
1458,VI,Whereby man's hope and heart may steer:
1459,VI,I pray you let not sorrow or fear
1460,VI,"Against his bidding stand."""
1461,VI,
1462,VI,"The strange knight gazed on him, and spake:"
1463,VI,"""Will you, for Arthur's royal sake,"
1464,VI,Be warrant for me that I take
1465,VI,No scathe from strife that man may make?
1466,VI,"Then will I go with you.""  And he"
1467,VI,"Made joyous answer: ""Yea, for I"
1468,VI,"Will be your warrant or will die."""
1469,VI,And thence they rode with hearts as high
1470,VI,As men's that search the sea.
1471,VI,
1472,VI,And as by noon's large light the twain
1473,VI,"Before the tented hall drew rein,"
1474,VI,"Suddenly fell the strange knight, slain"
1475,VI,By one that came and went again
1476,VI,And none might see him; but his spear
1477,VI,"Clove through the body, swift as fire,"
1478,VI,"The man whose doom, forefelt as dire,"
1479,VI,"Had darkened all his life's desire,"
1480,VI,As one that death held dear.
1481,VI,
1482,VI,"And dying he turned his face and said,"
1483,VI,"""Lo now thy warrant that my head"
1484,VI,"Should fall not, following forth where led"
1485,VI,A knight whose pledge hath left me dead.
1486,VI,This darkling manslayer hath to name
1487,VI,"Garlon: take thou my goodlier steed,"
1488,VI,"Seeing thine is less of strength and speed,"
1489,VI,"And ride, if thou be knight indeed,"
1490,VI,Even thither whence we came.
1491,VI,
1492,VI,"""And as the maiden's fair behest"
1493,VI,"Shall bid you follow on my quest,"
1494,VI,"Follow: and when God's will sees best,"
1495,VI,"Revenge my death, and let me rest"
1496,VI,"As one that lived and died a knight,"
1497,VI,"Unstained of shame alive or dead."""
1498,VI,"And Balen, wrung with sorrow, said,"
1499,VI,"""That shall I do: my hand and head"
1500,VI,"I pledge to do you right."""
1501,VI,
1502,VI,And thence with sorrowing heart and cheer
1503,VI,"He rode, in grief that cast out fear"
1504,VI,"Lest death in darkness yet were near,"
1505,VI,And bore the truncheon of the spear
1506,VI,Wherewith the woful knight lay slain
1507,VI,"To her with whom he rode, and she"
1508,VI,"Still bare it with her, fain to see"
1509,VI,What righteous doom of God's might be
1510,VI,The darkling manslayer's bane.
1511,VI,
1512,VI,And down a dim deep woodland way
1513,VI,They rode between the boughs asway
1514,VI,With flickering winds whose flash and play
1515,VI,Made sunlight sunnier where the day
1516,VI,"Laughed, leapt, and fluttered like a bird"
1517,VI,Caught in a light loose leafy net
1518,VI,That earth for amorous heaven had set
1519,VI,To hold and see the sundawn yet
1520,VI,And hear what morning heard.
1521,VI,
1522,VI,There in the sweet soft shifting light
1523,VI,Across their passage rode a knight
1524,VI,"Flushed hot from hunting as from fight,"
1525,VI,And seeing the sorrow-stricken sight
1526,VI,Made question of them why they rode
1527,VI,"As mourners sick at heart and sad,"
1528,VI,When all alive about them bade
1529,VI,Sweet earth for heaven's sweet sake be glad
1530,VI,As heaven for earth's love glowed.
1531,VI,
1532,VI,"""Me lists not tell you,"" Balen said."
1533,VI,The strange knight's face grew keen and red
1534,VI,"""Now, might my hand but keep my head,"
1535,VI,Even here should one of twain lie dead
1536,VI,"Were he no better armed than I."""
1537,VI,"And Balen spake with smiling speed,"
1538,VI,Where scorn and courtesy kept heed
1539,VI,"Of either: ""That should little need:"
1540,VI,"Not here shall either die."""
1541,VI,
1542,VI,And all the cause he told him through
1543,VI,As one that feared not though he knew
1544,VI,"All: and the strange knight spake anew,"
1545,VI,"Saying: ""I will part no more from you"
1546,VI,"While life shall last me.""  So they went"
1547,VI,"Where he might arm himself to ride,"
1548,VI,And rode across wild ways and wide
1549,VI,To where against a churchyard side
1550,VI,A hermit's harbour leant.
1551,VI,
1552,VI,And there against them riding came
1553,VI,Fleet as the lightning's laugh and flame
1554,VI,"The invisible evil, even the same"
1555,VI,They sought and might not curse by name
1556,VI,"As hell's foul child on earth set free,"
1557,VI,"And smote the strange knight through, and fled,"
1558,VI,And left the mourners by the dead.
1559,VI,"""Alas, again,"" Sir Balen said,"
1560,VI,"""This wrong he hath done to me."""
1561,VI,
1562,VI,And there they laid their dead to sleep
1563,VI,"Royally, lying where wild winds keep"
1564,VI,Keen watch and wail more soft and deep
1565,VI,Than where men's choirs bid music weep
1566,VI,And song like incense heave and swell.
1567,VI,"And forth again they rode, and found"
1568,VI,"Before them, dire in sight and sound,"
1569,VI,A castle girt about and bound
1570,VI,With sorrow like a spell.
1571,VI,
1572,VI,Above it seemed the sun at noon
1573,VI,Sad as a wintry withering moon
1574,VI,That shudders while the waste wind's tune
1575,VI,"Craves ever none may guess what boon,"
1576,VI,But all may know the boon for dire.
1577,VI,And evening on its darkness fell
1578,VI,"More dark than very death's farewell,"
1579,VI,"And night about it hung like hell,"
1580,VI,Whose fume the dawn made fire.
1581,VI,
1582,VI,And Balen lighted down and passed
1583,VI,"Within the gateway, whence no blast"
1584,VI,"Rang as the sheer portcullis, cast"
1585,VI,"Suddenly down, fell, and made fast"
1586,VI,"The gate behind him, whence he spied"
1587,VI,A sudden rage of men without
1588,VI,And ravin of a murderous rout
1589,VI,That girt the maiden hard about
1590,VI,With death on either side.
1591,VI,
1592,VI,"And seeing that shame and peril, fear"
1593,VI,Bade wrath and grief awake and hear
1594,VI,What shame should say in fame's wide ear
1595,VI,"If she, by sorrow sealed more dear"
1596,VI,"Than joy might make her, so should die:"
1597,VI,And up the tower's curled stair he sprang
1598,VI,"As one that flies death's deadliest fang,"
1599,VI,And leapt right out amid their gang
1600,VI,As fire from heaven on high.
1601,VI,
1602,VI,And they thereunder seeing the knight
1603,VI,Unhurt among their press alight
1604,VI,And bare his sword for chance of fight
1605,VI,"Stood from him, loth to strive or smite,"
1606,VI,"And bade him hear their woful word,"
1607,VI,That not the maiden's death they sought;
1608,VI,But there through years too dire for thought
1609,VI,"Had lain their lady stricken, and nought"
1610,VI,Might heal her: and he heard.
1611,VI,
1612,VI,For there a maiden clean and whole
1613,VI,"In virgin body and virgin soul,"
1614,VI,"Whose name was writ on royal roll,"
1615,VI,That would but stain a silver bowl
1616,VI,"With offering of her stainless blood,"
1617,VI,Therewith might heal her: so they stayed
1618,VI,For hope's sad sake each blameless maid
1619,VI,There journeying in that dolorous shade
1620,VI,Whose bloom was bright in bud.
1621,VI,
1622,VI,No hurt nor harm to her it were
1623,VI,If she should yield a sister there
1624,VI,"Some tribute of her blood, and fare"
1625,VI,"Forth with this joy at heart to bear,"
1626,VI,That all unhurt and unafraid
1627,VI,This grace she had here by God's grace wrought.
1628,VI,And kindling all with kindly thought
1629,VI,"And love that saw save love's self nought,"
1630,VI,"Shone, smiled, and spake the maid."
1631,VI,
1632,VI,"""Good knight of mine, good will have I"
1633,VI,"To help this healing though I die."""
1634,VI,"""Nay,"" Balen said, ""but love may try"
1635,VI,What help in living love may lie.
1636,VI,--I will not lose the life of her
1637,VI,"While my life lasteth.""  So she gave"
1638,VI,"The tribute love was fain to crave,"
1639,VI,"But might not heal though fain to save,"
1640,VI,Were God's grace helpfuller.
1641,VI,
1642,VI,Another maid in later Mays
1643,VI,"Won with her life that woful praise,"
1644,VI,"And died.  But they, when surging day's"
1645,VI,"Deep tide fulfilled the dawn's wide ways,"
1646,VI,"Rode forth, and found by day or night"
1647,VI,No chance to cross their wayfaring
1648,VI,Till when they saw the fourth day spring
1649,VI,A knight's hall gave them harbouring
1650,VI,Rich as a king's house might.
1651,VI,
1652,VI,And while they sat at meat and spake
1653,VI,Words bright and kind as grace might make
1654,VI,"Sweet for true knighthood's kindly sake,"
1655,VI,They heard a cry beside them break
1656,VI,The still-souled joy of blameless rest.
1657,VI,"""What noise is this?"" quoth Balen.  ""Nay,"""
1658,VI,"His knightly host made answer, ""may"
1659,VI,Our grief not grieve you though I say
1660,VI,How here I dwell unblest.
1661,VI,
1662,VI,"""Not many a day has lived and died"
1663,VI,Since at a tournay late I tried
1664,VI,My strength to smite and turn and ride
1665,VI,"Against a knight of kinglike pride,"
1666,VI,King Pellam's brother: twice I smote
1667,VI,The splendour of his strength to dust:
1668,VI,"And he, fulfilled of hate's fierce lust,"
1669,VI,"Swore vengeance, pledged for hell to trust,"
1670,VI,And keen as hell's wide throat.
1671,VI,
1672,VI,"""Invisible as the spirit of night"
1673,VI,That heaven and earth in depth and height
1674,VI,May see not by the mild moon's light
1675,VI,"Nor even when stars would grant them sight,"
1676,VI,He walks and slays as plague's blind breath
1677,VI,"Slays: and my son, whose anguish here"
1678,VI,"Makes moan perforce that mars our cheer,"
1679,VI,"He wounded, even ere love might fear"
1680,VI,That hate were strong as death.
1681,VI,
1682,VI,"""Nor may my son be whole till he"
1683,VI,Whose stroke through him hath stricken me
1684,VI,Shall give again his blood to be
1685,VI,Our healing: yet may no man see
1686,VI,"This felon, clothed with darkness round"
1687,VI,"And keen as lightning's life.""  Thereon"
1688,VI,"Spake Balen, and his presence shone"
1689,VI,Even as the sun's when stars are gone
1690,VI,That hear dawn's trumpet sound.
1691,VI,
1692,VI,"""That knight I know: two knights of mine,"
1693,VI,"Two comrades, sealed by faith's bright sign,"
1694,VI,"Whose eyes as ours that live should shine,"
1695,VI,And drink the golden sunlight's wine
1696,VI,"With joy's thanksgiving that they live,"
1697,VI,He hath slain in even the same blind wise:
1698,VI,Were all wide wealth beneath the skies
1699,VI,"Mine, might I meet him, eyes on eyes,"
1700,VI,"All would I laugh to give."""
1701,VI,
1702,VI,"His host made answer, and his gaze"
1703,VI,Grew bright with trust as dawn's moist maze
1704,VI,"With fire: ""Within these twenty days,"
1705,VI,"King Pellam, lord of Lystenayse,"
1706,VI,"Holds feast through all this country cried,"
1707,VI,And there before the knightly king
1708,VI,May no knight come except he bring
1709,VI,For witness of his wayfaring
1710,VI,His paramour or bride.
1711,VI,
1712,VI,"""And there that day, so soon to shine,"
1713,VI,"This knight, your felon foe and mine,"
1714,VI,"Shall show, full-flushed with bloodred wine,"
1715,VI,The fierce false face whereon we pine
1716,VI,"To wreak the wrong he hath wrought us, bare"
1717,VI,"As shame should see and brand it.""  ""Then,"""
1718,VI,"Said Balen, ""shall he give again"
1719,VI,"His blood to heal your son, and men"
1720,VI,"Shall see death blind him there."""
1721,VI,
1722,VI,"""Forth will we fare to-morrow,"" said"
1723,VI,"His host: and forth, as sunrise led,"
1724,VI,They rode; and fifteen days were fled
1725,VI,Ere toward their goal their steeds had sped.
1726,VI,And there alighting might they find
1727,VI,"For Balen's host no place to rest,"
1728,VI,Who came without a gentler guest
1729,VI,Beside him: and that household's hest
1730,VI,Bade leave his sword behind.
1731,VI,
1732,VI,"""Nay,"" Balen said, ""that do I not:"
1733,VI,"My country's custom stands, God wot,"
1734,VI,"That none whose lot is knighthood's lot,"
1735,VI,To ride where chance as fire is hot
1736,VI,"With hope or promise given of fight,"
1737,VI,"Shall fail to keep, for knighthood's part,"
1738,VI,His weapon with him as his heart;
1739,VI,"And as I came will I depart,"
1740,VI,"Or hold herein my right."""
1741,VI,
1742,VI,Then gat he leave to wear his sword
1743,VI,Beside the strange king's festal board
1744,VI,Where feasted many a knight and lord
1745,VI,In seemliness of fair accord:
1746,VI,"And Balen asked of one beside,"
1747,VI,"""Is there not in this court, if fame"
1748,VI,"Keep faith, a knight that hath to name"
1749,VI,"Garlon?"" and saying that word of shame,"
1750,VI,He scanned that place of pride.
1751,VI,
1752,VI,"""Yonder he goeth against the light,"
1753,VI,"He with the face as swart as night,"""
1754,VI,"Quoth the other: ""but he rides to fight"
1755,VI,"Hid round by charms from all men's sight,"
1756,VI,"And many a noble knight he hath slain,"
1757,VI,Being wrapt in darkness deep as hell
1758,VI,"And silence dark as shame.""  ""Ah, well,"""
1759,VI,"Said Balen, ""is that he? the spell"
1760,VI,"May be the sorcerer's bane."""
1761,VI,
1762,VI,"Then Balen gazed upon him long,"
1763,VI,"And thought, ""If here I wreak my wrong,"
1764,VI,"Alive I may not scape, so strong"
1765,VI,The felon's friends about him throng;
1766,VI,"And if I leave him here alive,"
1767,VI,This chance perchance may life not give
1768,VI,"Again: much evil, if he live,"
1769,VI,"He needs must do, should fear forgive"
1770,VI,"When wrongs bid strike and strive."""
1771,VI,
1772,VI,"And Garlon, seeing how Balen's eye"
1773,VI,Dwelt on him as his heart waxed high
1774,VI,"With joy in wrath to see him nigh,"
1775,VI,Rose wolf-like with a wolfish cry
1776,VI,"And crossed and smote him on the face,"
1777,VI,"Saying, ""Knight, what wouldst thou with me?  Eat,"
1778,VI,"For shame, and gaze not: eat thy meat"
1779,VI,Do that thou art come for: stands thy seat
1780,VI,"Next ours of royal race?"""
1781,VI,
1782,VI,"""Well hast thou said: thy rede rings true;"
1783,VI,"That which I came for will I do,"""
1784,VI,"Quoth Balen: forth his fleet sword flew,"
1785,VI,And clove the head of Garlon through
1786,VI,Clean to the shoulders.  Then he cried
1787,VI,"Loud to his lady, ""Give me here"
1788,VI,The truncheon of the shameful spear
1789,VI,"Wherewith he slew your knight, when fear"
1790,VI,"Bade hate in darkness ride."""
1791,VI,
1792,VI,"And gladly, bright with grief made glad,"
1793,VI,"She gave the truncheon as he bade,"
1794,VI,"For still she bare it with her, sad"
1795,VI,"And strong in hopeless hope she had,"
1796,VI,"Through all dark days of thwarting fear,"
1797,VI,To see if doom should fall aright
1798,VI,And as God's fire-fraught thunder smite
1799,VI,"That head, clothed round with hell-faced night,"
1800,VI,Bare now before her here.
1801,VI,
1802,VI,And Balen smote therewith the dead
1803,VI,"Dark felon's body through, and said"
1804,VI,"Aloud, ""With even this truncheon, red"
1805,VI,With baser blood than brave men bled
1806,VI,"Whom in thy shameful hand it slew,"
1807,VI,"Thou hast slain a nobler knight, and now"
1808,VI,It clings and cleaves thy body: thou
1809,VI,"Shall cleave again no brave man's brow,"
1810,VI,"Though hell would aid anew."""
1811,VI,
1812,VI,And toward his host he turned and spake;
1813,VI,"""Now for your son's long-suffering sake"
1814,VI,"Blood ye may fetch enough, and take"
1815,VI,"Wherewith to heal his hurt, and make"
1816,VI,"Death warm as life.""  Then rose a cry"
1817,VI,Loud as the wind's when stormy spring
1818,VI,Makes all the woodland rage and ring:
1819,VI,"""Thou hast slain my brother,"" said the king,"
1820,VI,"""And here with him shalt die."""
1821,VI,
1822,VI,"""Ay?"" Balen laughed him answer.  ""Well,"
1823,VI,"Do it then thyself.""  And the answer fell"
1824,VI,"Fierce as a blast of hate from hell,"
1825,VI,"""No man of mine that with me dwell"
1826,VI,Shall strike at thee but I their lord
1827,VI,"For love of this my brother slain."""
1828,VI,And Pellam caught and grasped amain
1829,VI,"A grim great weapon, fierce and fain"
1830,VI,To feed his hungering sword.
1831,VI,
1832,VI,"And eagerly he smote, and sped"
1833,VI,"Not well: for Balen's blade, yet red"
1834,VI,"With lifeblood of the murderous dead,"
1835,VI,Between the swordstroke and his head
1836,VI,"Shone, and the strength of the eager stroke"
1837,VI,"Shore it in sunder: then the knight,"
1838,VI,"Naked and weaponless for fight,"
1839,VI,Ran seeking him a sword to smite
1840,VI,As hope within him woke.
1841,VI,
1842,VI,And so their flight for deathward fast
1843,VI,From chamber forth to chamber passed
1844,VI,"Where lay no weapon, till the last"
1845,VI,Whose doors made way for Balen cast
1846,VI,Upon him as a sudden spell
1847,VI,Wonder that even as lightning leapt
1848,VI,"Across his heart and eyes, and swept"
1849,VI,As storm across his soul that kept
1850,VI,"Wild watch, and watched not well."
1851,VI,
1852,VI,"For there the deed he did, being near"
1853,VI,"Death's danger, breathless as the deer"
1854,VI,"Driven hard to bay, but void of fear,"
1855,VI,Brought sorrow down for many a year
1856,VI,On many a man in many a land.
1857,VI,"All glorious shone that chamber, bright"
1858,VI,As burns at sunrise heaven's own height:
1859,VI,"With cloth of gold the bed was dight,"
1860,VI,That flamed on either hand.
1861,VI,
1862,VI,And one he saw within it lie:
1863,VI,A table of all clear gold thereby
1864,VI,"Stood stately, fair as morning's eye,"
1865,VI,"With four strong silver pillars, high"
1866,VI,And firm as faith and hope may be:
1867,VI,"And on it shone the gift he sought,"
1868,VI,"A spear most marvellously wrought,"
1869,VI,That when his eye and handgrip caught
1870,VI,Small fear at heart had he.
1871,VI,
1872,VI,"Right on King Pellam then, as fire"
1873,VI,"Turns when the thwarting winds wax higher,"
1874,VI,"He turned, and smote him down.  So dire"
1875,VI,"The stroke was, when his heart's desire"
1876,VI,"Struck, and had all its fill of hate,"
1877,VI,That as the king fell swooning down
1878,VI,"Fell the walls, rent from base to crown,"
1879,VI,Prone as prone seas that break and drown
1880,VI,Ships fraught with doom for freight.
1881,VI,
1882,VI,And there for three days' silent space
1883,VI,Balen and Pellam face to face
1884,VI,"Lay dead or deathlike, and the place"
1885,VI,"Was death's blind kingdom, till the grace"
1886,VI,That God had given the sacred seer
1887,VI,For counsel or for comfort led
1888,VI,"His Merlin thither, and he said,"
1889,VI,"Standing between the quick and dead,"
1890,VI,"""Rise up, and rest not here."""
1891,VI,
1892,VI,And Balen rose and set his eyes
1893,VI,Against the seer's as one that tries
1894,VI,His heart against the sea's and sky's
1895,VI,"And fears not if he lives or dies,"
1896,VI,"Saying, ""I would have my damosel,"
1897,VI,"Ere I fare forth, to fare with me."""
1898,VI,"And sadly Merlin answered, ""See"
1899,VI,Where now she lies; death knows if she
1900,VI,Shall now fare ill or well.
1901,VI,
1902,VI,"""And in this world we meet no more,"
1903,VI,"Balen.""  And Balen, sorrowing sore,"
1904,VI,Though fearless yet the heart he bore
1905,VI,"Beat toward the life that lay before,"
1906,VI,Rode forth through many a wild waste land
1907,VI,"Where men cried out against him, mad"
1908,VI,With grievous faith in fear that bade
1909,VI,Their wrath make moan for doubt they had
1910,VI,Lest hell had armed his hand.
1911,VI,
1912,VI,For in that chamber's wondrous shrine
1913,VI,"Was part of Christ's own blood, the wine"
1914,VI,Shed of the true triumphal vine
1915,VI,Whose growth bids earth's deep darkness shine
1916,VI,As heaven's deep light through the air and sea;
1917,VI,That mystery toward our northern shore
1918,VI,Arimathean Joseph bore
1919,VI,"For healing of our sins of yore,"
1920,VI,That grace even there might be.
1921,VI,
1922,VI,And with that spear there shrined apart
1923,VI,Was Christ's side smitten to the heart.
1924,VI,And fiercer than the lightning's dart
1925,VI,"The stroke was, and the deathlike smart"
1926,VI,"Wherewith, nigh drained of blood and breath,"
1927,VI,The king lay stricken as one long dead:
1928,VI,"And Joseph's was the blood there shed,"
1929,VI,"For near akin was he that bled,"
1930,VI,Near even as life to death.
1931,VI,
1932,VI,And therefore fell on all that land
1933,VI,"Sorrow: for still on either hand,"
1934,VI,As Balen rode alone and scanned
1935,VI,Bright fields and cities built to stand
1936,VI,"Till time should break them, dead men lay;"
1937,VI,And loud and long from all their folk
1938,VI,"Living, one cry that cursed him broke;"
1939,VI,Three countries had his dolorous stroke
1940,VI,"Slain, or should surely slay."
1941,VI,
1942,VI,
1943,VI,
1944,VII,VII
1945,VII,
1946,VII,
1947,VII,"In winter, when the year burns low"
1948,VII,"As fire wherein no firebrands glow,"
1949,VII,And winds dishevel as they blow
1950,VII,"The lovely stormy wings of snow,"
1951,VII,The hearts of northern men burn bright
1952,VII,With joy that mocks the joy of spring
1953,VII,To hear all heaven's keen clarions ring
1954,VII,Music that bids the spirit sing
1955,VII,And day give thanks for night.
1956,VII,
1957,VII,Aloud and dark as hell or hate
1958,VII,Round Balen's head the wind of fate
1959,VII,Blew storm and cloud from death's wide gate:
1960,VII,But joy as grief in him was great
1961,VII,"To face God's doom and live or die,"
1962,VII,"Sorrowing for ill wrought unaware,"
1963,VII,Rejoicing in desire to dare
1964,VII,All ill that innocence might bear
1965,VII,With changeless heart and eye.
1966,VII,
1967,VII,Yet passing fain he was when past
1968,VII,Those lands and woes at length and last.
1969,VII,"Eight times, as thence he fared forth fast,"
1970,VII,Dawn rose and even was overcast
1971,VII,"With starry darkness dear as day,"
1972,VII,Before his venturous quest might meet
1973,VII,"Adventure, seeing within a sweet"
1974,VII,"Green low-lying forest, hushed in heat,"
1975,VII,A tower that barred his way.
1976,VII,
1977,VII,"Strong summer, dumb with rapture, bound"
1978,VII,With golden calm the woodlands round
1979,VII,Wherethrough the knight forth faring found
1980,VII,A knight that on the greenwood ground
1981,VII,"Sat mourning: fair he was to see,"
1982,VII,And moulded as for love or fight
1983,VII,A maiden's dreams might frame her knight;
1984,VII,But sad in joy's far-flowering sight
1985,VII,As grief's blind thrall might be.
1986,VII,
1987,VII,"""God save you,"" Balen softly said,"
1988,VII,"""What grief bows down your heart and head"
1989,VII,"Thus, as one sorrowing for his dead?"
1990,VII,"Tell me, if haply I may stead"
1991,VII,"In aught your sorrow, that I may."""
1992,VII,"""Sir knight,"" that other said, ""thy word"
1993,VII,"Makes my grief heavier that I heard."""
1994,VII,And pity and wonder inly stirred
1995,VII,Drew Balen thence away.
1996,VII,
1997,VII,And so withdrawn with silent speed
1998,VII,"He saw the sad knight's stately steed,"
1999,VII,"A war-horse meet for warrior's need,"
2000,VII,"That none who passed might choose but heed,"
2001,VII,"So strong he stood, so great, so fair,"
2002,VII,"With eyes afire for flight or fight,"
2003,VII,"A joy to look on, mild in might,"
2004,VII,"And swift and keen and kind as light,"
2005,VII,And all as clear of care.
2006,VII,
2007,VII,"And Balen, gazing on him, heard"
2008,VII,Again his master's woful word
2009,VII,Sound sorrow through the calm unstirred
2010,VII,"By fluttering wind or flickering bird,"
2011,VII,"Thus: ""Ah, fair lady and faithless, why"
2012,VII,Break thy pledged faith to meet me? soon
2013,VII,An hour beyond thy trothplight noon
2014,VII,"Shall strike my death-bell, and thy boon"
2015,VII,"Is this, that here I die."
2016,VII,
2017,VII,"""My curse for all thy gifts may be"
2018,VII,Heavier than death or night on thee;
2019,VII,For now this sword thou gavest me
2020,VII,"Shall set me from thy bondage free."""
2021,VII,"And there the man had died self-slain,"
2022,VII,But Balen leapt on him and caught
2023,VII,The blind fierce hand that fain had wrought
2024,VII,"Self-murder, stung with fire of thought,"
2025,VII,As rage makes anguish fain.
2026,VII,
2027,VII,"Then, mad for thwarted grief, ""Let go"
2028,VII,"My hand,"" the fool of wrath and woe"
2029,VII,"Cried, ""or I slay thee.""  Scarce the glow"
2030,VII,"In Balen's cheek and eye might show,"
2031,VII,"As dawn shows day while seas lie chill,"
2032,VII,"He heard, though pity took not heed,"
2033,VII,"But smiled and spake, ""That shall not need:"
2034,VII,What man may do to bid you speed
2035,VII,"I, so God speed me, will."""
2036,VII,
2037,VII,"And the other craved his name, beguiled"
2038,VII,By hope that made his madness mild.
2039,VII,Again Sir Balen spake and smiled:
2040,VII,"""My name is Balen, called the Wild"
2041,VII,By knights whom kings and courts make tame
2042,VII,Because I ride alone afar
2043,VII,"And follow but my soul for star."""
2044,VII,"""Ah, sir, I know the knight you are"
2045,VII,And all your fiery fame.
2046,VII,
2047,VII,"""The knight that bears two swords I know,"
2048,VII,"Most praised of all men, friend and foe,"
2049,VII,"For prowess of your hands, that show"
2050,VII,Dark war the way where balefires glow
2051,VII,"And kindle glory like the dawn's."""
2052,VII,"So spake the sorrowing knight, and stood"
2053,VII,As one whose heart fresh hope made good:
2054,VII,And forth they rode by wold and wood
2055,VII,And down the glimmering lawns.
2056,VII,
2057,VII,And Balen craved his name who rode
2058,VII,"Beside him, where the wild wood glowed"
2059,VII,With joy to feel how noontide flowed
2060,VII,Through glade and glen and rough green road
2061,VII,Till earth grew joyful as the sea.
2062,VII,"""My name is Garnysshe of the Mount,"
2063,VII,"A poor man's son of none account,"""
2064,VII,"He said, ""where springs of loftier fount"
2065,VII,Laugh loud with pride to be.
2066,VII,
2067,VII,"""But strength in weakness lives and stands"
2068,VII,As rocks that rise through shifting sands;
2069,VII,And for the prowess of my hands
2070,VII,"One made me knight and gave me lands,"
2071,VII,"Duke Hermel, lord from far to near,"
2072,VII,Our prince; and she that loved me--she
2073,VII,"I love, and deemed she loved but me,"
2074,VII,"His daughter, pledged her faith to be"
2075,VII,"Ere now beside me here."""
2076,VII,
2077,VII,"And Balen, brief of speech as light"
2078,VII,"Whose word, beheld of depth and height,"
2079,VII,"Strikes silence through the stars of night,"
2080,VII,"Spake, and his face as dawn's grew bright,"
2081,VII,"For hope to help a happier man,"
2082,VII,"""How far then lies she hence?""  ""By this,"""
2083,VII,"Her lover sighed and said, ""I wis,"
2084,VII,"Not six fleet miles the passage is,"
2085,VII,"And straight as thought could span."""
2086,VII,
2087,VII,"So rode they swift and sure, and found"
2088,VII,A castle walled and dyked around:
2089,VII,"And Balen, as a warrior bound"
2090,VII,On search where hope might fear to sound
2091,VII,"The darkness of the deeps of doubt,"
2092,VII,Made entrance through the guardless gate
2093,VII,"As life, while hope in life grows great,"
2094,VII,Makes way between the doors of fate
2095,VII,That death may pass thereout.
2096,VII,
2097,VII,"Through many a glorious chamber, wrought"
2098,VII,For all delight that love's own thought
2099,VII,"Might dream or dwell in, Balen sought"
2100,VII,"And found of all he looked for nought,"
2101,VII,For like a shining shell her bed
2102,VII,Shone void and vacant of her: thence
2103,VII,Through devious wonders bright and dense
2104,VII,He passed and saw with shame-struck sense
2105,VII,Where shame and faith lay dead.
2106,VII,
2107,VII,"Down in a sweet small garden, fair"
2108,VII,"With flowerful joy in the ardent air,"
2109,VII,"He saw, and raged with loathing, where"
2110,VII,She lay with love-dishevelled hair
2111,VII,Beneath a broad bright laurel tree
2112,VII,"And clasped in amorous arms a knight,"
2113,VII,The unloveliest that his scornful sight
2114,VII,Had dwelt on yet; a shame the bright
2115,VII,Broad noon might shrink to see.
2116,VII,
2117,VII,"And thence in wrathful hope he turned,"
2118,VII,"Hot as the heart within him burned,"
2119,VII,"To meet the knight whose love, so spurned"
2120,VII,"And spat on and made nought of, yearned"
2121,VII,"And dreamed and hoped and lived in vain,"
2122,VII,"And said, ""I have found her sleeping fast,"""
2123,VII,And led him where the shadows cast
2124,VII,From leaves wherethrough light winds ran past
2125,VII,Screened her from sun and rain.
2126,VII,
2127,VII,"But Garnysshe, seeing, reeled as he stood"
2128,VII,"Like a tree, kingliest of the wood,"
2129,VII,Half hewn through: and the burning blood
2130,VII,Through lips and nostrils burst aflood:
2131,VII,And gathering back his rage and might
2132,VII,As broken breakers rally and roar
2133,VII,"The loud wind down that drives off shore,"
2134,VII,He smote their heads off: there no more
2135,VII,Their life might shame the light.
2136,VII,
2137,VII,"Then turned he back toward Balen, mad"
2138,VII,"With grief, and said, ""The grief I had"
2139,VII,Was nought: ere this my life was glad:
2140,VII,Thou hast done this deed: I was but sad
2141,VII,And fearful how my hope might fare:
2142,VII,"I had lived my sorrow down, hadst thou"
2143,VII,"Not shown me what I saw but now."""
2144,VII,The sorrow and scorn on Balen's brow
2145,VII,Bade silence curb him there.
2146,VII,
2147,VII,"And Balen answered: ""What I did"
2148,VII,I did to hearten thee and bid
2149,VII,Thy courage know that shame should rid
2150,VII,A man's high heart of love that hid
2151,VII,"Blind shame within its core: God knows,"
2152,VII,"I did, to set a bondman free,"
2153,VII,"But as I would thou hadst done by me,"
2154,VII,That seeing what love must die to see
2155,VII,"Love's end might well be woe's."""
2156,VII,
2157,VII,"""Alas,"" the woful weakling said,"
2158,VII,"""I have slain what most I loved: I have shed"
2159,VII,The blood most near my heart: the head
2160,VII,"Lies cold as earth, defiled and dead,"
2161,VII,"That all my life was lighted by,"
2162,VII,"That all my soul bowed down before,"
2163,VII,And now may bear with life no more:
2164,VII,For now my sorrow that I bore
2165,VII,"Is twofold, and I die."""
2166,VII,
2167,VII,Then with his red wet sword he rove
2168,VII,"His breast in sunder, where it clove"
2169,VII,"Life, and no pulse against it strove,"
2170,VII,So sure and strong the deep stroke drove
2171,VII,"Deathward: and Balen, seeing him dead,"
2172,VII,"Rode thence, lest folk would say he had slain"
2173,VII,Those three; and ere three days again
2174,VII,"Had seen the sun's might wax and wane,"
2175,VII,Far forth he had spurred and sped.
2176,VII,
2177,VII,And riding past a cross whereon
2178,VII,"Broad golden letters written shone,"
2179,VII,"Saying, ""No knight born may ride alone"
2180,VII,"Forth toward this castle,"" and all the stone"
2181,VII,Glowed in the sun's glare even as though
2182,VII,Blood stained it from the crucified
2183,VII,"Dead burden of one that there had died,"
2184,VII,An old hoar man he saw beside
2185,VII,Whose face was wan as woe.
2186,VII,
2187,VII,"""Balen the Wild,"" he said, ""this way"
2188,VII,Thy way lies not: thou hast passed to-day
2189,VII,"Thy bands: but turn again, and stay"
2190,VII,"Thy passage, while thy soul hath sway"
2191,VII,"Within thee, and through God's good power"
2192,VII,"It will avail thee:"" and anon"
2193,VII,"His likeness as a cloud was gone,"
2194,VII,And Balen's heart within him shone
2195,VII,Clear as the cloudless hour.
2196,VII,
2197,VII,Nor fate nor fear might overcast
2198,VII,The soul now near its peace at last.
2199,VII,"Suddenly, thence as forth he past,"
2200,VII,A mighty and a deadly blast
2201,VII,"Blown of a hunting-horn he heard,"
2202,VII,As when the chase hath nobly sped.
2203,VII,"""That blast is blown for me,"" he said,"
2204,VII,"""The prize am I who am yet not dead,"""
2205,VII,And smiled upon the word.
2206,VII,
2207,VII,As toward a royal hart's death rang
2208,VII,"That note, whence all the loud wood sang"
2209,VII,With winged and living sound that sprang
2210,VII,"Like fire, and keen as fire's own fang"
2211,VII,Pierced the sweet silence that it slew.
2212,VII,But nought like death or strife was here:
2213,VII,Fair semblance and most goodly cheer
2214,VII,"They made him, they whose troop drew near"
2215,VII,As death among them drew.
2216,VII,
2217,VII,A hundred ladies well arrayed
2218,VII,And many a knight well weaponed made
2219,VII,That kindly show of cheer: the glade
2220,VII,Shone round them till its very shade
2221,VII,Lightened and laughed from grove to lawn
2222,VII,To hear and see them: so they brought
2223,VII,Within a castle fair as thought
2224,VII,Could dream that wizard hands had wrought
2225,VII,The guest among them drawn.
2226,VII,
2227,VII,All manner of glorious joy was there:
2228,VII,"Harping and dancing, loud and fair,"
2229,VII,And minstrelsy that made of air
2230,VII,"Fire, so like fire its raptures were."
2231,VII,Then the chief lady spake on high:
2232,VII,"""Knight with the two swords, one of two"
2233,VII,Must help you here or fall from you:
2234,VII,For needs you now must have ado
2235,VII,And joust with one hereby.
2236,VII,
2237,VII,"""A good knight guards an island here"
2238,VII,"Against all swords that chance brings near,"
2239,VII,And there with stroke of sword and spear
2240,VII,Must all for whom these halls make cheer
2241,VII,"Fight, and redeem or yield up life."""
2242,VII,"""An evil custom,"" Balen said,"
2243,VII,"""Is this, that none whom chance hath led"
2244,VII,"Hither, if knighthood crown his head,"
2245,VII,"May pass unstirred to strife."""
2246,VII,
2247,VII,"""You shall not have ado to fight"
2248,VII,"Here save against one only knight,"""
2249,VII,"She said, and all her face grew bright"
2250,VII,"As hell-fire, lit with hungry light"
2251,VII,That wicked laughter touched with flame.
2252,VII,"""Well, since I shall thereto,"" said he,"
2253,VII,"""I am ready at heart as death for me:"
2254,VII,Fain would I be where death should be
2255,VII,And life should lose its name.
2256,VII,
2257,VII,"""But travelling men whose goal afar"
2258,VII,Shines as a cloud-constraining star
2259,VII,"Are often weary, and wearier are"
2260,VII,Their steeds that feel each fret and jar
2261,VII,"Wherewith the wild ways wound them: yet,"
2262,VII,"Albeit my horse be weary, still"
2263,VII,My heart is nowise weary; will
2264,VII,Sustains it even till death fulfil
2265,VII,"My trust upon him set."""
2266,VII,
2267,VII,"""Sir,"" said a knight thereby that stood,"
2268,VII,"""Meseems your shield is now not good"
2269,VII,"But worn with warrior work, nor could"
2270,VII,Sustain in strife the strokes it would:
2271,VII,"A larger will I lend you.""  ""Ay,"
2272,VII,"Thereof I thank you,"" Balen said,"
2273,VII,Being single of heart as one that read
2274,VII,"No face aright whence faith had fled,"
2275,VII,Nor dreamed that faith could fly.
2276,VII,
2277,VII,And so he took that shield unknown
2278,VII,"And left for treason's touch his own,"
2279,VII,"And toward that island rode alone,"
2280,VII,Nor heard the blast against him blown
2281,VII,"Sound in the wind's and water's sound,"
2282,VII,But hearkening toward the stream's edge heard
2283,VII,"Nought save the soft stream's rippling word,"
2284,VII,"Glad with the gladness of a bird,"
2285,VII,That sang to the air around.
2286,VII,
2287,VII,And there against the water-side
2288,VII,"He saw, fast moored to rock and ride,"
2289,VII,A fair great boat anear abide
2290,VII,"Like one that waits the turning tide,"
2291,VII,Wherein embarked his horse and he
2292,VII,Passed over toward no kindly strand:
2293,VII,And where they stood again on land
2294,VII,There stood a maiden hard at hand
2295,VII,Who seeing them wept to see.
2296,VII,
2297,VII,"And ""O knight Balen,"" was her cry,"
2298,VII,"""Why have ye left your own shield? why"
2299,VII,Come hither out of time to die?
2300,VII,"For had ye kept your shield, thereby"
2301,VII,"Ye had yet been known, and died not here."
2302,VII,Great pity it is of you this day
2303,VII,"As ever was of knight, or may"
2304,VII,"Be ever, seeing in war's bright way"
2305,VII,"Praise knows not Balen's peer."""
2306,VII,
2307,VII,"And Balen said, ""Thou hast heard my name"
2308,VII,"Right: it repenteth me, though shame"
2309,VII,"May tax me not with base men's blame,"
2310,VII,"That ever, hap what will, I came"
2311,VII,"Within this country; yet, being come,"
2312,VII,For shame I may not turn again
2313,VII,"Now, that myself and nobler men"
2314,VII,"May scorn me: now is more than then,"
2315,VII,And faith bids fear be dumb.
2316,VII,
2317,VII,"""Be it life or death, my chance I take,"
2318,VII,Be it life's to build or death's to break:
2319,VII,"And fall what may, me lists not make"
2320,VII,"Moan for sad life's or death's sad sake."""
2321,VII,"Then looked he on his armour, glad"
2322,VII,"And high of heart, and found it strong:"
2323,VII,And all his soul became a song
2324,VII,"And soared in prayer that soared not long,"
2325,VII,For all the hope it had.
2326,VII,
2327,VII,Then saw he whence against him came
2328,VII,"A steed whose trappings shone like flame,"
2329,VII,And he that rode him showed the same
2330,VII,"Fierce colour, bright as fire or fame,"
2331,VII,But dark the visors were as night
2332,VII,"That hid from Balen Balan's face,"
2333,VII,And his from Balan: God's own grace
2334,VII,Forsook them for a shadowy space
2335,VII,Where darkness cast out light.
2336,VII,
2337,VII,The two swords girt that Balen bare
2338,VII,Gave Balan for a breath's while there
2339,VII,"Pause, wondering if indeed it were"
2340,VII,"Balen his brother, bound to dare"
2341,VII,The chance of that unhappy quest:
2342,VII,But seeing not as he thought to see
2343,VII,"His shield, he deemed it was not he,"
2344,VII,"And so, as fate bade sorrow be,"
2345,VII,They laid their spears in rest.
2346,VII,
2347,VII,So mighty was the course they ran
2348,VII,"With spear to spear so great of span,"
2349,VII,"Each fell back stricken, man by man,"
2350,VII,"Horse by horse, borne down: so the ban"
2351,VII,That wrought by doom against them wrought:
2352,VII,But Balen by his falling steed
2353,VII,"Was bruised the sorer, being indeed"
2354,VII,"Way-weary, like a rain-bruised reed,"
2355,VII,With travel ere he fought.
2356,VII,
2357,VII,And Balen rose again from swoon
2358,VII,"First, and went toward him: all too soon"
2359,VII,"He too then rose, and the evil boon"
2360,VII,"Of strength came back, and the evil tune"
2361,VII,Of battle unnatural made again
2362,VII,Mad music as for death's wide ear
2363,VII,Listening and hungering toward the near
2364,VII,Last sigh that life or death might hear
2365,VII,At last from dying men.
2366,VII,
2367,VII,"Balan smote Balen first, and clove"
2368,VII,His lifted shield that rose and strove
2369,VII,In vain against the stroke that drove
2370,VII,Down: as the web that morning wove
2371,VII,Of glimmering pearl from spray to spray
2372,VII,"Dies when the strong sun strikes it, so"
2373,VII,"Shrank the steel, tempered thrice to show"
2374,VII,"Strength, as the mad might of the blow"
2375,VII,Shore Balen's helm away.
2376,VII,
2377,VII,Then turning as a turning wave
2378,VII,"Against the land-wind, blind and brave"
2379,VII,"In hope that dreams despair may save,"
2380,VII,With even the unhappy sword that gave
2381,VII,The gifts of fame and fate in one
2382,VII,"He smote his brother, and there had nigh"
2383,VII,"Felled him: and while they breathed, his eye"
2384,VII,"Glanced up, and saw beneath the sky"
2385,VII,Sights fairer than the sun.
2386,VII,
2387,VII,The towers of all the castle there
2388,VII,"Stood full of ladies, blithe and fair"
2389,VII,As the earth beneath and the amorous air
2390,VII,About them and above them were:
2391,VII,So toward the blind and fateful fight
2392,VII,"Again those brethren went, and sore"
2393,VII,"Were all the strokes they smote and bore,"
2394,VII,"And breathed again, and fell once more"
2395,VII,To battle in their sight.
2396,VII,
2397,VII,With blood that either spilt and bled
2398,VII,"Was all the ground they fought on red,"
2399,VII,And each knight's hauberk hewn and shred
2400,VII,"Left each unmailed and naked, shed"
2401,VII,From off them even as mantles cast:
2402,VII,"And oft they breathed, and drew but breath"
2403,VII,"Brief as the word strong sorrow saith,"
2404,VII,"And poured and drank the draught of death,"
2405,VII,Till fate was full at last.
2406,VII,
2407,VII,"And Balan, younger born than he"
2408,VII,"Whom darkness bade him slay, and be"
2409,VII,"Slain, as in mist where none may see"
2410,VII,"If aught abide or fall or flee,"
2411,VII,"Drew back a little and laid him down,"
2412,VII,"Dying: but Balen stood, and said,"
2413,VII,As one between the quick and dead
2414,VII,"Might stand and speak, ""What good knight's head"
2415,VII,Hath won this mortal crown?
2416,VII,
2417,VII,"""What knight art thou? for never I"
2418,VII,Who now beside thee dead shall die
2419,VII,Found yet the knight afar or nigh
2420,VII,"That matched me.""  Then his brother's eye"
2421,VII,Flashed pride and love; he spake and smiled
2422,VII,"And felt in death life's quickening flame,"
2423,VII,"And answered: ""Balan is my name,"
2424,VII,The good knight Balen's brother; fame
2425,VII,"Calls and miscalls him wild."""
2426,VII,
2427,VII,The cry from Balen's lips that sprang
2428,VII,Sprang sharper than his sword's stroke rang.
2429,VII,"More keen than death's or memory's fang,"
2430,VII,Through sense and soul the shuddering pang
2431,VII,"Shivered: and scarce he had cried, ""Alas"
2432,VII,"That ever I should see this day,"""
2433,VII,When sorrow swooned from him away
2434,VII,"As blindly back he fell, and lay"
2435,VII,Where sleep lets anguish pass.
2436,VII,
2437,VII,But Balan rose on hands and knees
2438,VII,And crawled by childlike dim degrees
2439,VII,"Up toward his brother, as a breeze"
2440,VII,Creeps wingless over sluggard seas
2441,VII,When all the wind's heart fails it: so
2442,VII,"Beneath their mother's eyes had he,"
2443,VII,"A babe that laughed with joy to be,"
2444,VII,Made toward him standing by her knee
2445,VII,For love's sake long ago.
2446,VII,
2447,VII,"Then, gathering strength up for a space,"
2448,VII,From off his brother's dying face
2449,VII,With dying hands that wrought apace
2450,VII,While death and life would grant them grace
2451,VII,"He loosed his helm and knew not him,"
2452,VII,"So scored with blood it was, and hewn"
2453,VII,Athwart with darkening wounds: but soon
2454,VII,Life strove and shuddered through the swoon
2455,VII,Wherein its light lay dim.
2456,VII,
2457,VII,And sorrow set these chained words free:
2458,VII,"""O Balan, O my brother! me"
2459,VII,"Thou hast slain, and I, my brother, thee"
2460,VII,"And now far hence, on shore and sea,"
2461,VII,"Shall all the wide world speak of us."""
2462,VII,"""Alas,"" said Balan, ""that I might"
2463,VII,"Not know you, seeing two swords were dight"
2464,VII,About you; now the unanswering sight
2465,VII,Hath here found answer thus.
2466,VII,
2467,VII,"""Because you bore another shield"
2468,VII,"Than yours, that even ere youth could wield"
2469,VII,Like arms with manhood's tried and steeled
2470,VII,"Shone as my star of battle-field,"
2471,VII,I deemed it surely might not be
2472,VII,"My brother.""  Then his brother spake"
2473,VII,"Fiercely: ""Would God, for thy sole sake,"
2474,VII,"I had my life again, to take"
2475,VII,Revenge for only thee!
2476,VII,
2477,VII,"""For all this deadly work was wrought"
2478,VII,"Of one false knight's false word and thought,"
2479,VII,Whose mortal craft and counsel caught
2480,VII,"And snared my faith who doubted nought,"
2481,VII,And made me put my shield away.
2482,VII,"Ah, might I live, I would destroy"
2483,VII,That castle for its customs: joy
2484,VII,"There makes of grief a deadly toy,"
2485,VII,"And death makes night of day."""
2486,VII,
2487,VII,"""Well done were that, if aught were done"
2488,VII,"Well ever here beneath the sun,"""
2489,VII,"Said Balan: ""better work were none:"
2490,VII,For hither since I came and won
2491,VII,"A woful honour born of death,"
2492,VII,When here my hap it was to slay
2493,VII,"A knight who kept this island way,"
2494,VII,I might not pass by night or day
2495,VII,"Hence, as this token saith."
2496,VII,
2497,VII,"""No more shouldst thou, for all the might"
2498,VII,Of heart and hand that seals thee knight
2499,VII,"Most noble of all that see the light,"
2500,VII,"Brother, hadst thou but slain in fight"
2501,VII,"Me, and arisen unscathed and whole,"
2502,VII,As would to God thou hadst risen! though here
2503,VII,"Light is as darkness, hope as fear,"
2504,VII,And love as hate: and none draws near
2505,VII,"Save toward a mortal goal."""
2506,VII,
2507,VII,"Then, fair as any poison-flower"
2508,VII,Whose blossom blights the withering bower
2509,VII,"Whereon its blasting breath has power,"
2510,VII,Forth fared the lady of the tower
2511,VII,"With many a lady and many a knight,"
2512,VII,And came across the water-way
2513,VII,Even where on death's dim border lay
2514,VII,Those brethren sent of her to slay
2515,VII,And die in kindless fight.
2516,VII,
2517,VII,And all those hard light hearts were swayed
2518,VII,With pity passing like a shade
2519,VII,"That stays not, and may be not stayed,"
2520,VII,"To hear the mutual moan they made,"
2521,VII,"Each to behold his brother die,"
2522,VII,"Saying, ""Both we came out of one tomb,"
2523,VII,"One star-crossed mother's woful womb,"
2524,VII,And so within one grave-pit's gloom
2525,VII,"Untimely shall we lie."""
2526,VII,
2527,VII,"And Balan prayed, as God should bless"
2528,VII,"That lady for her gentleness,"
2529,VII,That where the battle's mortal stress
2530,VII,Had made for them perforce to press
2531,VII,The bed whence never man may rise
2532,VII,"They twain, free now from hopes and fears,"
2533,VII,"Might sleep; and she, as one that hears,"
2534,VII,Bowed her bright head: and very tears
2535,VII,Fell from her cold fierce eyes.
2536,VII,
2537,VII,Then Balen prayed her send a priest
2538,VII,"To housel them, that ere they ceased"
2539,VII,The hansel of the heavenly feast
2540,VII,That fills with light from the answering east
2541,VII,The sunset of the life of man
2542,VII,"Might bless them, and their lips be kissed"
2543,VII,"With death's requickening eucharist,"
2544,VII,And death's and life's dim sunlit mist
2545,VII,Pass as a stream that ran.
2546,VII,
2547,VII,And so their dying rites were done:
2548,VII,"And Balen, seeing the death-struck sun"
2549,VII,"Sink, spake as he whose goal is won:"
2550,VII,"""Now, when our trophied tomb is one,"
2551,VII,"And over us our tale is writ,"
2552,VII,"How two that loved each other, two"
2553,VII,"Born and begotten brethren, slew"
2554,VII,"Each other, none that reads anew"
2555,VII,Shall choose but weep for it.
2556,VII,
2557,VII,"""And no good knight and no good man"
2558,VII,Whose eye shall ever come to scan
2559,VII,The record of the imperious ban
2560,VII,That made our life so sad a span
2561,VII,"Shall read or hear, who shall not pray"
2562,VII,"For us for ever.""  Then anon"
2563,VII,"Died Balan; but the sun was gone,"
2564,VII,"And deep the stars of midnight shone,"
2565,VII,Ere Balen passed away.
2566,VII,
2567,VII,"And there low lying, as hour on hour"
2568,VII,"Fled, all his life in all its flower"
2569,VII,Came back as in a sunlit shower
2570,VII,"Of dreams, when sweet-souled sleep has power"
2571,VII,On life less sweet and glad to be.
2572,VII,He drank the draught of life's first wine
2573,VII,"Again: he saw the moorland shine,"
2574,VII,"The rioting rapids of the Tyne,"
2575,VII,"The woods, the cliffs, the sea."
2576,VII,
2577,VII,"The joy that lives at heart and home,"
2578,VII,"The joy to rest, the joy to roam,"
2579,VII,"The joy of crags and scaurs he clomb,"
2580,VII,The rapture of the encountering foam
2581,VII,"Embraced and breasted of the boy,"
2582,VII,"The first good steed his knees bestrode,"
2583,VII,The first wild sound of songs that flowed
2584,VII,"Through ears that thrilled and heart that glowed,"
2585,VII,Fulfilled his death with joy.
2586,VII,
2587,VII,"So, dying not as a coward that dies"
2588,VII,And dares not look in death's dim eyes
2589,VII,Straight as the stars on seas and skies
2590,VII,"Whence moon and sun recoil and rise,"
2591,VII,"He looked on life and death, and slept."
2592,VII,"And there with morning Merlin came,"
2593,VII,And on the tomb that told their fame
2594,VII,"He wrote by Balan's Balen's name,"
2595,VII,"And gazed thereon, and wept."
2596,VII,
2597,VII,For all his heart within him yearned
2598,VII,With pity like as fire that burned.
2599,VII,The fate his fateful eye discerned
2600,VII,"Far off now dimmed it, ere he turned"
2601,VII,"His face toward Camelot, to tell"
2602,VII,Arthur of all the storms that woke
2603,VII,"Round Balen, and the dolorous stroke,"
2604,VII,And how that last blind battle broke
2605,VII,The consummated spell.
2606,VII,
2607,VII,"""Alas,"" King Arthur said, ""this day"
2608,VII,I have heard the worst that woe might say:
2609,VII,For in this world that wanes away
2610,VII,"I know not two such knights as they."""
2611,VII,This is the tale that memory writes
2612,VII,"Of men whose names like stars shall stand,"
2613,VII,"Balen and Balan, sure of hand,"
2614,VII,"Two brethren of Northumberland,"
2615,VII,In life and death good knights.
