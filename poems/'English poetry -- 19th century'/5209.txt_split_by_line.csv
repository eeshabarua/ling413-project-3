35,SENECA.,
36,VISITOR.,VISITOR.
37,VISITOR.,
38,VISITOR.,I'll know no more;--the heart is torn
39,VISITOR.,By views of woe we cannot heal;
40,VISITOR.,"Long shall I see these things forlorn,"
41,VISITOR.,"And oft again their griefs shall feel,"
42,VISITOR.,As each upon the mind shall steal;
43,VISITOR.,"That wan projector's mystic style,"
44,VISITOR.,"That lumpish idiot leering by,"
45,VISITOR.,"That peevish idler's ceaseless wile,"
46,VISITOR.,"And that poor maiden's half-form'd smile,"
47,VISITOR.,While struggling for the full-drawn sigh! -
48,VISITOR.,I'll know no more.
49,VISITOR.,
50,PHYSICIAN.,PHYSICIAN.
51,PHYSICIAN.,
52,PHYSICIAN.,"Yes, turn again;"
53,PHYSICIAN.,"Then speed to happier scenes thy way,"
54,PHYSICIAN.,"When thou hast view'd, what yet remain,"
55,PHYSICIAN.,"The ruins of Sir Eustace Grey,"
56,PHYSICIAN.,"The sport of madness, misery's prey:"
57,PHYSICIAN.,"But he will no historian need,"
58,PHYSICIAN.,"His cares, his crimes, will he display,"
59,PHYSICIAN.,And show (as one from frenzy freed)
60,PHYSICIAN.,"The proud lost mind, the rash-done deed."
61,PHYSICIAN.,
62,PHYSICIAN.,That cell to him is Greyling Hall:  -
63,PHYSICIAN.,Approach; he'll bid thee welcome there;
64,PHYSICIAN.,"Will sometimes for his servant call,"
65,PHYSICIAN.,And sometimes point the vacant chair:
66,PHYSICIAN.,"He can, with free and easy air,"
67,PHYSICIAN.,Appear attentive and polite;
68,PHYSICIAN.,"Can veil his woes in manners fair,"
69,PHYSICIAN.,And pity with respect excite.
70,PHYSICIAN.,
71,PATIENT.,PATIENT.
72,PATIENT.,
73,PATIENT.,Who comes?--Approach!--'tis kindly done:  -
74,PATIENT.,"My learn'd physician, and a friend,"
75,PATIENT.,"Their pleasures quit, to visit one"
76,PATIENT.,"Who cannot to their ease attend,"
77,PATIENT.,"Nor joys bestow, nor comforts lend,"
78,PATIENT.,"As when I lived so blest, so well,"
79,PATIENT.,And dreamt not I must soon contend
80,PATIENT.,With those malignant powers of hell.
81,PATIENT.,
82,PHYSICIAN.,PHYSICIAN.
83,PHYSICIAN.,
84,PHYSICIAN.,"""Less warmth, Sir Eustace, or we go."""
85,PHYSICIAN.,
86,PATIENT.,PATIENT.
87,PATIENT.,
88,PATIENT.,"See! I am calm as infant love,"
89,PATIENT.,"A very child, but one of woe,"
90,PATIENT.,"Whom you should pity, not reprove:  -"
91,PATIENT.,"But men at ease, who never strove"
92,PATIENT.,"With passions wild, will calmly show"
93,PATIENT.,"How soon we may their ills remove,"
94,PATIENT.,And masters of their madness grow.
95,PATIENT.,
96,PATIENT.,"Some twenty years, I think, are gone, -"
97,PATIENT.,"(Time flies I know not how, away,)"
98,PATIENT.,"The sun upon no happier shone,"
99,PATIENT.,"Nor prouder man, than Eustace Grey."
100,PATIENT.,"Ask where you would, and all would say,"
101,PATIENT.,"The man admired and praised of all,"
102,PATIENT.,"By rich and poor, by grave and gay,"
103,PATIENT.,Was the young lord of Greyling Hall.
104,PATIENT.,
105,PATIENT.,Yes! I had youth and rosy health;
106,PATIENT.,"Was nobly form'd, as man might be;"
107,PATIENT.,"For sickness, then, of all my wealth,"
108,PATIENT.,I never gave a single fee:
109,PATIENT.,"The ladies fair, the maidens free,"
110,PATIENT.,"Were all accustom'd then to say,"
111,PATIENT.,Who would a handsome figure see
112,PATIENT.,Should look upon Sir Eustace Grey.
113,PATIENT.,
114,PATIENT.,"He had a frank and pleasant look,"
115,PATIENT.,A cheerful eye and accent bland;
116,PATIENT.,His very speech and manner spoke
117,PATIENT.,"The generous heart, the open hand;"
118,PATIENT.,"About him all was gay or grand,"
119,PATIENT.,He had the praise of great and small;
120,PATIENT.,"He bought, improved, projected, plann'd,"
121,PATIENT.,And reign'd a prince at Greyling Hall.
122,PATIENT.,
123,PATIENT.,My lady!--she was all we love;
124,PATIENT.,All praise (to speak her worth) is faint;
125,PATIENT.,"Her manners show'd the yielding dove,"
126,PATIENT.,"Her morals, the seraphic saint:"
127,PATIENT.,She never breath'd nor look'd complaint;
128,PATIENT.,No equal upon earth had she -
129,PATIENT.,"Now, what is this fair thing I paint?"
130,PATIENT.,Alas! as all that live shall be.
131,PATIENT.,
132,PATIENT.,"There was, beside, a gallant youth,"
133,PATIENT.,And him my bosom's friend I had; -
134,PATIENT.,"Oh! I was rich in very truth,"
135,PATIENT.,It made me proud--it made me mad! -
136,PATIENT.,"Yes, I was lost--but there was cause! -"
137,PATIENT.,Where stood my tale?--I cannot find -
138,PATIENT.,"But I had all mankind's applause,"
139,PATIENT.,And all the smiles of womankind.
140,PATIENT.,
141,PATIENT.,"There were two cherub-things beside,"
142,PATIENT.,"A gracious girl, a glorious boy;"
143,PATIENT.,"Yet more to swell my full-blown pride,"
144,PATIENT.,"To varnish higher my fading joy,"
145,PATIENT.,"Pleasures were ours without alloy,"
146,PATIENT.,"Nay, Paradise,--till my frail Eve"
147,PATIENT.,Our bliss was tempted to destroy -
148,PATIENT.,Deceived and fated to deceive.
149,PATIENT.,
150,PATIENT.,"But I deserved;--for all that time,"
151,PATIENT.,"When I was loved, admired, caress'd,."
152,PATIENT.,"There was within, each secret crime,"
153,PATIENT.,"Unfelt, uncancell'd, unconfess'd:"
154,PATIENT.,"I never then my God address'd,"
155,PATIENT.,In grateful praise or humble prayer;
156,PATIENT.,And if His Word was not my jest -
157,PATIENT.,(Dread thought!) it never was my care.
158,PATIENT.,
159,PATIENT.,I doubted: --fool I was to doubt!
160,PATIENT.,"If that all-piercing eye could see, -"
161,PATIENT.,"If He who looks all worlds throughout,"
162,PATIENT.,Would so minute and careful be
163,PATIENT.,As to perceive and punish me:  -
164,PATIENT.,"With man I would be great and high,"
165,PATIENT.,"But with my God so lost, that He,"
166,PATIENT.,In His large view should pass me by.
167,PATIENT.,
168,PATIENT.,"Thus blest with children, friend, and wife,"
169,PATIENT.,Blest far beyond the vulgar lot;
170,PATIENT.,"Of all that gladdens human life,"
171,PATIENT.,Where was the good that I had not?
172,PATIENT.,"But my vile heart had sinful spot,"
173,PATIENT.,And Heaven beheld its deep'ning stain;
174,PATIENT.,"Eternal justice I forgot,"
175,PATIENT.,And mercy sought not to obtain.
176,PATIENT.,
177,PATIENT.,"Come near,--I'll softly speak the rest! -"
178,PATIENT.,"Alas! 'tis known to all the crowd,"
179,PATIENT.,Her guilty love was all confess'd;
180,PATIENT.,"And his, who so much truth avow'd,"
181,PATIENT.,My faithless friend's.--In pleasure proud
182,PATIENT.,"I sat, when these cursed tidings came;"
183,PATIENT.,"Their guilt, their flight was told aloud,"
184,PATIENT.,And Envy smiled to hear my shame!
185,PATIENT.,
186,PATIENT.,I call'd on Vengeance; at the word
187,PATIENT.,She came: --Can I the deed forget?
188,PATIENT.,I held the sword--the accursed sword
189,PATIENT.,The blood of his false heart made wet;
190,PATIENT.,"And that fair victim paid her debt,"
191,PATIENT.,"She pined, she died, she loath'd to live; -"
192,PATIENT.,I saw her dying--see her yet:
193,PATIENT.,Fair fallen thing! my rage forgive!
194,PATIENT.,
195,PATIENT.,"Those cherubs still, my life to bless,"
196,PATIENT.,"Were left; could I my fears remove,"
197,PATIENT.,"Sad fears that check'd each fond caress,"
198,PATIENT.,And poison'd all parental love?
199,PATIENT.,"Yet that with jealous feelings strove,"
200,PATIENT.,"And would at last have won my will,"
201,PATIENT.,"Had I not, wretch! been doom'd to prove"
202,PATIENT.,Th' extremes of mortal good and ill.
203,PATIENT.,
204,PATIENT.,In youth! health! joy! in beauty's pride!
205,PATIENT.,They droop'd--as flowers when blighted bow;
206,PATIENT.,"The dire infection came: --they died,"
207,PATIENT.,And I was cursed--as I am now; -
208,PATIENT.,"Nay, frown not, angry friend,--allow"
209,PATIENT.,"That I was deeply, sorely tried;"
210,PATIENT.,"Hear then, and you must wonder how"
211,PATIENT.,I could such storms and strifes abide.
212,PATIENT.,
213,PATIENT.,"Storms!--not that clouds embattled make,"
214,PATIENT.,When they afflict this earthly globe;
215,PATIENT.,But such as with their terrors shake
216,PATIENT.,"Man's breast, and to the bottom probe;"
217,PATIENT.,"They make the hypocrite disrobe,"
218,PATIENT.,"They try us all, if false or true;"
219,PATIENT.,For this one Devil had power on Job;
220,PATIENT.,And I was long the slave of two.
221,PATIENT.,
222,PHYSICIAN.,PHYSICIAN.
223,PHYSICIAN.,
224,PHYSICIAN.,"Peace, peace, my friend; these subjects fly;"
225,PHYSICIAN.,Collect thy thoughts--go calmly on. -
226,PHYSICIAN.,
227,PATIENT.,PATIENT.
228,PATIENT.,
229,PATIENT.,And shall I then the fact deny?
230,PATIENT.,"I was--thou know'st--I was begone,"
231,PATIENT.,"Like him who fill'd the eastern throne,"
232,PATIENT.,To whom the Watcher cried aloud;
233,PATIENT.,"That royal wretch of Babylon,"
234,PATIENT.,Who was so guilty and so proud.
235,PATIENT.,
236,PATIENT.,"Like him, with haughty, stubborn mind,"
237,PATIENT.,"I, in my state, my comforts sought;"
238,PATIENT.,"Delight and praise I hoped to find,"
239,PATIENT.,"In what I builded, planted! bought!"
240,PATIENT.,Oh! arrogance! by misery taught -
241,PATIENT.,Soon came a voice! I felt it come;
242,PATIENT.,"""Full be his cup, with evil fraught,"
243,PATIENT.,"Demons his guides, and death his doom!"""
244,PATIENT.,
245,PATIENT.,Then was I cast from out my state;
246,PATIENT.,Two fiends of darkness led my way;
247,PATIENT.,"They waked me early, watch'd me late,"
248,PATIENT.,"My dread by night, my plague by day!"
249,PATIENT.,"Oh! I was made their sport, their play,"
250,PATIENT.,Through many a stormy troubled year;
251,PATIENT.,And how they used their passive prey
252,PATIENT.,Is sad to tell: --but you shall hear.
253,PATIENT.,
254,PATIENT.,And first before they sent me forth.
255,PATIENT.,"Through this unpitying world to run,"
256,PATIENT.,"They robb'd Sir Eustace of his worth,"
257,PATIENT.,"Lands, manors, lordships, every one;"
258,PATIENT.,"So was that gracious man undone,"
259,PATIENT.,"Was spurn'd as vile, was scorn'd as poor,"
260,PATIENT.,"Whom every former friend would shun,"
261,PATIENT.,And menials drove from every door.
262,PATIENT.,
263,PATIENT.,"Then rose ill-favour'd Ones, whom none"
264,PATIENT.,"But my unhappy eyes could view,"
265,PATIENT.,"Led me, with wild emotion, on,"
266,PATIENT.,"And, with resistless terror, drew."
267,PATIENT.,"Through lands we fled, o'er seas we flew,"
268,PATIENT.,And halted on a boundless plain;
269,PATIENT.,"Where nothing fed, nor breathed, nor grew,"
270,PATIENT.,But silence ruled the still domain.
271,PATIENT.,
272,PATIENT.,"Upon that boundless plain, below,"
273,PATIENT.,"The setting sun's last rays were shed,"
274,PATIENT.,"And gave a mild and sober glow,"
275,PATIENT.,"Where all were still, asleep, or dead;"
276,PATIENT.,"Vast ruins in the midst were spread,"
277,PATIENT.,"Pillars and pediments sublime,"
278,PATIENT.,"Where the gray mass had form'd a bed,"
279,PATIENT.,And clothed the crumbling spoils of time.
280,PATIENT.,
281,PATIENT.,"There was I fix'd, I know not how,"
282,PATIENT.,Condemn'd for untold years to stay:
283,PATIENT.,Yet years were not;--one dreadful Now
284,PATIENT.,Endured no change of night or day;
285,PATIENT.,The same mild evening's sleeping ray
286,PATIENT.,"Shone softly solemn and serene,"
287,PATIENT.,"And all that time I gazed away,"
288,PATIENT.,The setting sun's sad rays were seen.
289,PATIENT.,
290,PATIENT.,"At length a moment's sleep stole on, -"
291,PATIENT.,Again came my commission'd foes;
292,PATIENT.,"Again through sea and land we're gone,"
293,PATIENT.,"No peace, no respite, no repose;"
294,PATIENT.,"Above the dark broad sea we rose,"
295,PATIENT.,We ran through bleak and frozen land;
296,PATIENT.,"I had no strength their strength t'oppose,"
297,PATIENT.,An infant in a giant's hand.
298,PATIENT.,
299,PATIENT.,"They placed me where those streamers play,"
300,PATIENT.,Those nimble beams of brilliant light;
301,PATIENT.,"It would the stoutest heart dismay,"
302,PATIENT.,"To see, to feel, that dreadful sight:"
303,PATIENT.,"So swift, so pure, so cold, so bright,"
304,PATIENT.,They pierced my frame with icy wound;
305,PATIENT.,"And all that half-year's polar night,"
306,PATIENT.,Those dancing streamers wrapp'd me round.
307,PATIENT.,
308,PATIENT.,"Slowly that darkness pass'd away,"
309,PATIENT.,"When down upon the earth I fell, -"
310,PATIENT.,Some hurried sleep was mine by day;
311,PATIENT.,"But soon as toll'd the evening bell,"
312,PATIENT.,"They forced me on, where ever dwell"
313,PATIENT.,"Far-distant men, in cities fair,"
314,PATIENT.,"Cities of whom no travellers tell,"
315,PATIENT.,Nor feet but mine were wanderers there.
316,PATIENT.,
317,PATIENT.,"Their watchmen stare, and stand aghast,"
318,PATIENT.,As on we hurry through the dark;
319,PATIENT.,"The watch-light blinks as we go past,"
320,PATIENT.,The watch-dog shrinks and fears to bark;
321,PATIENT.,"The watch-tower's bell sounds shrill; and, hark"
322,PATIENT.,The free wind blows--we've left the town -
323,PATIENT.,"A wild sepulchral ground I mark,"
324,PATIENT.,And on a tombstone place me down.
325,PATIENT.,
326,PATIENT.,What monuments of mighty dead!
327,PATIENT.,What tombs of various kinds are found!
328,PATIENT.,And stones erect their shadows shed
329,PATIENT.,"On humble graves, with wickers bound,"
330,PATIENT.,"Some risen fresh, above the ground,"
331,PATIENT.,Some level with the native clay:
332,PATIENT.,"What sleeping millions wait the sound,"
333,PATIENT.,"""Arise, ye dead, and come away!"""
334,PATIENT.,
335,PATIENT.,Alas! they stay not for that call;
336,PATIENT.,"Spare me this woe! ye demons, spare!"
337,PATIENT.,"They come! the shrouded shadows all, -"
338,PATIENT.,'Tis more than mortal brain can bear;
339,PATIENT.,"Rustling they rise, they sternly glare"
340,PATIENT.,At man upheld by vital breath;
341,PATIENT.,"Who, led by wicked fiends, should dare"
342,PATIENT.,To join the shadowy troops of death!
343,PATIENT.,
344,PATIENT.,"Yes, I have felt all man can feel,"
345,PATIENT.,Till he shall pay his nature's debt;
346,PATIENT.,"Ills that no hope has strength to heal,"
347,PATIENT.,No mind the comfort to forget:
348,PATIENT.,"Whatever cares the heart can fret,"
349,PATIENT.,"The spirits wear, the temper gall,"
350,PATIENT.,"Woe, want, dread, anguish, all beset"
351,PATIENT.,My sinful soul!--together all!
352,PATIENT.,
353,PATIENT.,Those fiends upon a shaking fen
354,PATIENT.,"Fix'd me, in dark tempestuous night;"
355,PATIENT.,"There never trod the foot of men,"
356,PATIENT.,There flock'd the fowl in wint'ry flight;
357,PATIENT.,There danced the moor's deceitful light
358,PATIENT.,Above the pool where sedges grow;
359,PATIENT.,"And when the morning-sun shone bright,"
360,PATIENT.,It shone upon a field of snow.
361,PATIENT.,
362,PATIENT.,"They hung me on a bow so small,"
363,PATIENT.,The rook could build her nest no higher;
364,PATIENT.,They fix'd me on the trembling ball
365,PATIENT.,That crowns the steeple's quiv'ring spire;
366,PATIENT.,"They set me where the seas retire,"
367,PATIENT.,But drown with their returning tide;
368,PATIENT.,"And made me flee the mountain's fire,"
369,PATIENT.,When rolling from its burning side.
370,PATIENT.,
371,PATIENT.,I've hung upon the ridgy steep
372,PATIENT.,"Of cliffs, and held the rambling brier;"
373,PATIENT.,"I've plunged below the billowy deep,"
374,PATIENT.,Where air was sent me to respire;
375,PATIENT.,I've been where hungry wolves retire;
376,PATIENT.,And (to complete my woes) I've ran
377,PATIENT.,Where Bedlam's crazy crew conspire
378,PATIENT.,Against the life of reasoning man.
379,PATIENT.,
380,PATIENT.,"I've furl'd in storms the flapping sail,"
381,PATIENT.,By hanging from the topmast-head;
382,PATIENT.,"I've served the vilest slaves in jail,"
383,PATIENT.,And pick'd the dunghill's spoil for bread;
384,PATIENT.,I've made the badger's hole my bed:
385,PATIENT.,I've wander'd with a gipsy crew;
386,PATIENT.,"I've dreaded all the guilty dread,"
387,PATIENT.,And done what they would fear to do.
388,PATIENT.,
389,PATIENT.,"On sand, where ebbs and flows the flood,"
390,PATIENT.,Midway they placed and bade me die;
391,PATIENT.,"Propp'd on my staff, I stoutly stood"
392,PATIENT.,When the swift waves came rolling by;
393,PATIENT.,"And high they rose, and still more high,"
394,PATIENT.,Till my lips drank the bitter brine;
395,PATIENT.,"I sobb'd convulsed, then cast mine eye,"
396,PATIENT.,And saw the tide's re-flowing sign.
397,PATIENT.,
398,PATIENT.,"And then, my dreams were such as nought"
399,PATIENT.,Could yield but my unhappy case;
400,PATIENT.,"I've been of thousand devils caught,"
401,PATIENT.,And thrust into that horrid place
402,PATIENT.,"Where reign dismay, despair, disgrace;"
403,PATIENT.,"Furies with iron fangs were there,"
404,PATIENT.,To torture that accursed race
405,PATIENT.,"Doom'd to dismay, disgrace, despair."
406,PATIENT.,
407,PATIENT.,Harmless I was; yet hunted down
408,PATIENT.,"For treasons, to my soul unfit;"
409,PATIENT.,"I've been pursued through many a town,"
410,PATIENT.,For crimes that petty knaves commit;
411,PATIENT.,"I've been adjudged t'have lost my wit,"
412,PATIENT.,Because I preached so loud and well;
413,PATIENT.,"And thrown into the dungeon's pit,"
414,PATIENT.,For trampling on the pit of hell.
415,PATIENT.,
416,PATIENT.,"Such were the evils, man of sin,"
417,PATIENT.,That I was fated to sustain;
418,PATIENT.,"And add to all, without--within,"
419,PATIENT.,A soul defiled with every stain
420,PATIENT.,That man's reflecting mind can pain;
421,PATIENT.,"That pride, wrong, rage, despair, can make;"
422,PATIENT.,"In fact, they'd nearly touch'd my brain,"
423,PATIENT.,And reason on her throne would shake.
424,PATIENT.,
425,PATIENT.,"But pity will the vilest seek,"
426,PATIENT.,"If punish'd guilt will not repine, -"
427,PATIENT.,"I heard a heavenly teacher speak,"
428,PATIENT.,And felt the SUN OF MERCY shine:
429,PATIENT.,I hailed the light! the birth divine!
430,PATIENT.,And then was seal'd among the few;
431,PATIENT.,"Those angry fiends beheld the sign,"
432,PATIENT.,And from me in an instant flew.
433,PATIENT.,
434,PATIENT.,Come hear how thus the charmers cry
435,PATIENT.,"To wandering sheep, the strays of sin,"
436,PATIENT.,"While some the wicket-gate pass by,"
437,PATIENT.,And some will knock and enter in:
438,PATIENT.,"Full joyful 'tis a soul to win,"
439,PATIENT.,For he that winneth souls is wise;
440,PATIENT.,"Now hark! the holy strains begin,"
441,PATIENT.,And thus the sainted preacher cries: --{1}
442,PATIENT.,
443,PATIENT.,"""Pilgrim, burthen'd with thy sin,"
444,PATIENT.,"Come the way to Zion's gate,"
445,PATIENT.,"There, till Mercy let thee in,"
446,PATIENT.,Knock and weep and watch and wait.
447,PATIENT.,Knock!--He knows the sinner's cry!
448,PATIENT.,Weep!--He loves the mourner's tears:
449,PATIENT.,Watch!--for saving grace is nigh:
450,PATIENT.,"Wait,--till heavenly light appears."
451,PATIENT.,
452,PATIENT.,"""Hark! it is the Bridegroom's voice:"
453,PATIENT.,"Welcome, pilgrim, to thy rest;"
454,PATIENT.,"Now within the gate rejoice,"
455,PATIENT.,Safe and seal'd and bought and blest!
456,PATIENT.,"Safe--from all the lures of vice,"
457,PATIENT.,"Seal'd--by signs the chosen know,"
458,PATIENT.,"Bought--by love and life the price,"
459,PATIENT.,Blest--the mighty debt to owe.
460,PATIENT.,
461,PATIENT.,"""Holy Pilgrim! what for thee"
462,PATIENT.,In a world like this remain?
463,PATIENT.,From thy guarded breast shall flee
464,PATIENT.,"Fear and shame, and doubt and pain."
465,PATIENT.,"Fear--the hope of Heaven shall fly,"
466,PATIENT.,"Shame--from glory's view retire,"
467,PATIENT.,"Doubt--in certain rapture die,"
468,PATIENT.,"Pain--in endless bliss expire."""
469,PATIENT.,
470,PATIENT.,"But though my day of grace was come,"
471,PATIENT.,Yet still my days of grief I find;
472,PATIENT.,The former clouds' collected gloom
473,PATIENT.,Still sadden the reflecting mind;
474,PATIENT.,"The soul, to evil things consign'd,"
475,PATIENT.,Will of their evil some retain;
476,PATIENT.,"The man will seem to earth inclined,"
477,PATIENT.,And will not look erect again.
478,PATIENT.,
479,PATIENT.,"Thus, though elect, I feel it hard"
480,PATIENT.,"To lose what I possess'd before,"
481,PATIENT.,"To be from all my wealth debarr'd, -"
482,PATIENT.,The brave Sir Eustace is no more:
483,PATIENT.,"But old I wax, and passing poor,"
484,PATIENT.,"Stern, rugged men my conduct view;"
485,PATIENT.,"They chide my wish, they bar my door,"
486,PATIENT.,'Tis hard--I weep--you see I do. -
487,PATIENT.,
488,PATIENT.,"Must you, my friends, no longer stay?"
489,PATIENT.,Thus quickly all my pleasures end;
490,PATIENT.,"But I'll remember when I pray,"
491,PATIENT.,My kind physician and his friend;
492,PATIENT.,"And those sad hours, you deign to spend"
493,PATIENT.,"With me, I shall requite them all;"

1040,SWIFT.,"In Fairy-land, on wide and cheerless plain,"

1042,SWIFT.,"A hireling he, who, when he till'd the soil,"
1043,SWIFT.,"Look'd to the pittance that repaid his toil,"
1044,SWIFT.,And to a master left the mingled joy
1045,SWIFT.,And anxious care that follow'd his employ.
1046,SWIFT.,"Sullen and patient he at once appear'd,"

1057,SWIFT.,And daylight drop through glassy door above:
1058,SWIFT.,"'Twas all her pride, new traps for praise to lay,"
1059,SWIFT.,And all her wisdom was to hide her way;
1060,SWIFT.,"In small attempts incessant were her pains,"
1061,SWIFT.,And Cunning was her name among the swains.
1062,SWIFT.,"Now, whether fate decreed this pair should wed,"

1067,SWIFT.,But both disposed to wed--and wed they were.
1068,SWIFT.,"Yet, though united in their fortune, still"

1070,SWIFT.,"Nor long the maid had bless'd the simple man,"
1071,SWIFT.,"Before dissensions rose, and she began:  -"

1110,SWIFT.,"But left by him, their natures they assume,"
1111,SWIFT.,"And fatal, in their poisoning force, become."
1112,SWIFT.,"Time fled, and now the swain compell'd to see"
1113,SWIFT.,"New cause for fear--""Is this thy thrift?"" quoth he,"
1114,SWIFT.,To whom the wife with cheerful voice replied:  -
1115,SWIFT.,"""Thou moody man, lay all thy fears aside;"
1116,SWIFT.,"I've seen a vision--they, from whom I came,"
1117,SWIFT.,"A daughter promise, promise wealth and fame;"

1121,SWIFT.,"The fairies round shall at her birth attend,"
1122,SWIFT.,"The friend of all in all shall find a friend,"
1123,SWIFT.,And save that one sad star that hour must gleam
1124,SWIFT.,"On our fair child, how glorious were my dream?"""
1125,SWIFT.,"This heard the husband, and, in surly smile,"
1126,SWIFT.,"Aim'd at contempt, but yet he hoped the while;"
1127,SWIFT.,"For as, when sinking, wretched men are found"
1128,SWIFT.,To catch at rushes rather than be drown'd;
1129,SWIFT.,"So on a dream our peasant placed his hope,"
1130,SWIFT.,And found that rush as valid as a rope.
1131,SWIFT.,"Swift fled the days, for now in hope they fled,"
1132,SWIFT.,When a fair daughter bless'd the nuptial bed;
1133,SWIFT.,"Her infant-face the mother's pains beguiled,"
1134,SWIFT.,She look'd so pleasing and so softly smiled;
1135,SWIFT.,"Those smiles, those looks, with sweet sensations moved"
1136,SWIFT.,"The gazer's soul, and as he look'd he loved."
1137,SWIFT.,"And now the fairies came with gifts, to grace"
1138,SWIFT.,"So mild a nature, and so fair a face."
1139,SWIFT.,"They gave, with beauty, that bewitching art,"
1140,SWIFT.,That holds in easy chains the human heart;
1141,SWIFT.,"They gave her skill to win the stubborn mind,"
1142,SWIFT.,"To make the suffering to their sorrows blind,"
1143,SWIFT.,"To bring on pensive looks the pleasing smile,"
1144,SWIFT.,And Care's stern brow of every frown beguile.
1145,SWIFT.,"These magic favours graced the infant-maid,"
1146,SWIFT.,Whose more enlivening smile the charming gifts repaid.
1147,SWIFT.,"Now Fortune changed, who, were she constant long,"
1148,SWIFT.,Would leave us few adventures for our song.
1149,SWIFT.,"A wicked elfin roved this land around,"
1150,SWIFT.,Whose joys proceeded from the griefs he found;
1151,SWIFT.,Envy his name: --his fascinating eye
1152,SWIFT.,From the light bosom drew the sudden sigh;
1153,SWIFT.,"Unsocial he, but with malignant mind,"
1154,SWIFT.,"He dwelt with man, that he might curse mankind;"
1155,SWIFT.,"Like the first foe, he sought th' abode of Joy"
1156,SWIFT.,"Grieved to behold, but eager to destroy;"
1157,SWIFT.,"Round blooming beauty, like the wasp, he flew,"
1158,SWIFT.,"Soil'd the fresh sweet, and changed the rosy hue;"
1159,SWIFT.,"The wise, the good, with anxious heart he saw,"
1160,SWIFT.,"And here a failing found, and there a flaw;"
1161,SWIFT.,"Discord in families 'twas his to move,"
1162,SWIFT.,"Distrust in friendship, jealousy in love;"
1163,SWIFT.,"He told the poor, what joys the great possess'd;"
1164,SWIFT.,"The great, what calm content the cottage bless'd:"
1165,SWIFT.,"To part the learned and the rich he tried,"
1166,SWIFT.,Till their slow friendship perish'd in their pride.
1167,SWIFT.,"Such was the fiend, and so secure of prey,"
1168,SWIFT.,That only Misery pass'd unstung away.
1169,SWIFT.,"Soon as he heard the fairy-babe was born,"
1170,SWIFT.,"Scornful he smiled, but felt no more than scorn:"
1171,SWIFT.,"For why, when Fortune placed her state so low,"
1172,SWIFT.,In useless spite his lofty malice show?
1173,SWIFT.,"Why, in a mischief of the meaner kind,"
1174,SWIFT.,Exhaust the vigour of a ranc'rous mind;
1175,SWIFT.,"But, soon as Fame the fairy-gifts proclaim'd,"
1176,SWIFT.,Quick-rising wrath his ready soul inflamed
1177,SWIFT.,"To swear, by vows that e'en the wicked tie,"
1178,SWIFT.,The nymph should weep her varied destiny;
1179,SWIFT.,"That every gift, that now appear'd to shine"
1180,SWIFT.,"In her fair face, and make her smiles divine,"
1181,SWIFT.,"Should all the poison of his magic prove,"
1182,SWIFT.,"And they should scorn her, whom she sought for love."
1183,SWIFT.,"His spell prepared, in form an ancient dame,"
1184,SWIFT.,"A fiend in spirit, to the cot he came;"
1185,SWIFT.,"There gain'd admittance, and the infant press'd"
1186,SWIFT.,(Muttering his wicked magic) to his breast;
1187,SWIFT.,"And thus he said: --""Of all the powers who wait"
1188,SWIFT.,"On Jove's decrees, and do the work of fate,"
1189,SWIFT.,"Was I, alone, despised or worthless, found,"
1190,SWIFT.,"Weak to protect, or impotent to wound?"
1191,SWIFT.,"See then thy foe, regret the friendship lost,"
1192,SWIFT.,"And learn my skill, but learn it at your cost."
1193,SWIFT.,"""Know, then, O child! devote to fates severe,"
1194,SWIFT.,"The good shall hate thy name, the wise shall fear;"
1195,SWIFT.,"Wit shall deride, and no protecting friend"
1196,SWIFT.,"Thy shame shall cover, or thy name defend."
1197,SWIFT.,"Thy gentle sex, who, more than ours, should spare"
1198,SWIFT.,"A humble foe, will greater scorn declare;"
1199,SWIFT.,"The base alone thy advocates shall be,"
1200,SWIFT.,"Or boast alliance with a wretch like thee."""
1201,SWIFT.,"He spake, and vanish'd, other prey to find,"
1202,SWIFT.,And waste in slow disease the conquer'd mind.
1203,SWIFT.,"Awed by the elfin's threats, and fill'd with dread"
1204,SWIFT.,"The parents wept, and sought their infant's bed;"
1205,SWIFT.,Despair alone the father's soul possess'd;
1206,SWIFT.,But hope rose gently in the mother's breast;
1207,SWIFT.,For well she knew that neither grief nor joy
1208,SWIFT.,"Pain'd without hope, or pleased without alloy;"
1209,SWIFT.,"And while these hopes and fears her heart divide,"
1210,SWIFT.,A cheerful vision bade the fears subside.
1211,SWIFT.,She saw descending to the world below
1212,SWIFT.,"An ancient form, with solemn pace and slow."
1213,SWIFT.,"""Daughter, no more be sad"" (the phantom cried),"
1214,SWIFT.,"""Success is seldom to the wise denied;"
1215,SWIFT.,"In idle wishes fools supinely stay,"
1216,SWIFT.,"Be there a will, and wisdom finds a way:"
1217,SWIFT.,"Why art thou grieved?  Be rather glad, that he"
1218,SWIFT.,"Who hates the happy, aims his darts at thee,"
1219,SWIFT.,But aims in vain; thy favour'd daughter lies
1220,SWIFT.,"Serenely blest, and shall to joy arise."
1221,SWIFT.,"For, grant that curses on her name shall wait,"
1222,SWIFT.,"(So Envy wills, and such the voice of Fate,)"
1223,SWIFT.,"Yet if that name be prudently suppress'd,"
1224,SWIFT.,"She shall be courted, favour'd, and caress'd."
1225,SWIFT.,"""For what are names? and where agree mankind,"
1226,SWIFT.,In those to persons or to acts assign'd?
1227,SWIFT.,"Brave, learn'd, or wise, if some their favourites call,"
1228,SWIFT.,Have they the titles or the praise from all?
1229,SWIFT.,"Not so, but others will the brave disdain"
1230,SWIFT.,"As rash, and deem the sons of wisdom vain;"
1231,SWIFT.,"The self-same mind shall scorn or kindness move,"
1232,SWIFT.,And the same deed attract contempt and love.
1233,SWIFT.,"""So all the powers who move the human soul,"
1234,SWIFT.,"With all the passions who the will control,"
1235,SWIFT.,"Have various names--One giv'n by Truth Divine,"

1237,SWIFT.,"The rest by man, who now, as wisdom's prize"
1238,SWIFT.,"My secret counsels, now as art despise;"
1239,SWIFT.,"One hour, as just, those counsels they embrace,"
