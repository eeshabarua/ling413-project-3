28,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,
29,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,"A Sonnet is a moment's monument,--"
30,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,Memorial from the Soul's eternity
31,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,"To one dead deathless hour. Look that it be,"
32,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,"Whether for lustral rite or dire portent,"
33,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,Of its own arduous fulness reverent:
34,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,"Carve it in ivory or in ebony,"
35,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,As Day or Night may rule; and let Time see
36,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,Its flowering crest impearled and orient.
37,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,
38,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,A Sonnet is a coin: its face reveals
39,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,"The soul,--its converse, to what Power 'tis due:--"
40,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,Whether for tribute to the august appeals
41,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,"Of Life, or dower in Love's high retinue,"
42,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,"It serve; or, 'mid the dark wharf's cavernous breath,"
43,INTRODUCTORY SONNET,In Charon's palm it pay the toll to Death.

47,LOVE ENTHRONED,LOVE ENTHRONED
48,LOVE ENTHRONED,
49,LOVE ENTHRONED,I marked all kindred Powers the heart finds fair:--
50,LOVE ENTHRONED,"Truth, with awed lips; and Hope, with eyes upcast;"
51,LOVE ENTHRONED,"And Fame, whose loud wings fan the ashen Past"
52,LOVE ENTHRONED,"To signal-fires, Oblivion's flight to scare;"
53,LOVE ENTHRONED,"And Youth, with still some single golden hair"
54,LOVE ENTHRONED,"Unto his shoulder clinging, since the last"
55,LOVE ENTHRONED,Embrace wherein two sweet arms held him fast;
56,LOVE ENTHRONED,"And Life, still wreathing flowers for Death to wear."
57,LOVE ENTHRONED,
58,LOVE ENTHRONED,Love's throne was not with these; but far above
59,LOVE ENTHRONED,All passionate wind of welcome and farewell
60,LOVE ENTHRONED,He sat in breathless bowers they dream not of;
61,LOVE ENTHRONED,"Though Truth foreknow Love's heart, and Hope foretell,"
62,LOVE ENTHRONED,"And Fame be for Love's sake desirable,"
63,LOVE ENTHRONED,"And Youth be dear, and Life be sweet to Love."
64,LOVE ENTHRONED,
65,LOVE ENTHRONED,
66,LOVE ENTHRONED,
67,BRIDAL BIRTH,BRIDAL BIRTH
68,BRIDAL BIRTH,
69,BRIDAL BIRTH,"As when desire, long darkling, dawns, and first"
70,BRIDAL BIRTH,"The mother looks upon the new-born child,"
71,BRIDAL BIRTH,Even so my Lady stood at gaze and smiled
72,BRIDAL BIRTH,When her soul knew at length the Love it nursed.
73,BRIDAL BIRTH,"Born with her life, creature of poignant thirst"
74,BRIDAL BIRTH,"And exquisite hunger, at her heart Love lay"
75,BRIDAL BIRTH,"Quickening in darkness, till a voice that day"
76,BRIDAL BIRTH,"Cried on him, and the bonds of birth were burst."
77,BRIDAL BIRTH,
78,BRIDAL BIRTH,"Now, shielded in his wings, our faces yearn"
79,BRIDAL BIRTH,"Together, as his fullgrown feet now range"
80,BRIDAL BIRTH,"The grove, and his warm hands our couch prepare:"
81,BRIDAL BIRTH,Till to his song our bodiless souls in turn
82,BRIDAL BIRTH,"Be born his children, when Death's nuptial change"
83,BRIDAL BIRTH,Leaves us for light the halo of his hair.
84,BRIDAL BIRTH,
85,BRIDAL BIRTH,
86,BRIDAL BIRTH,
87,REDEMPTION,REDEMPTION
88,REDEMPTION,
89,REDEMPTION,O Thou who at Love's hour ecstatically
90,REDEMPTION,Unto my lips dost evermore present
91,REDEMPTION,The body and blood of Love in sacrament;
92,REDEMPTION,Whom I have neared and felt thy breath to be
93,REDEMPTION,The inmost incense of his sanctuary;
94,REDEMPTION,"Who without speech hast owned him, and intent"
95,REDEMPTION,"Upon his will, thy life with mine hast blent,"
96,REDEMPTION,"And murmured o'er the cup, Remember me!--"
97,REDEMPTION,
98,REDEMPTION,"O what from thee the grace, for me the prize,"
99,REDEMPTION,"And what to Love the glory,--when the whole"
100,REDEMPTION,Of the deep stair thou tread'st to the dim shoal
101,REDEMPTION,"And weary water of the place of sighs,"
102,REDEMPTION,"And there dost work deliverance, as thine eyes"
103,REDEMPTION,Draw up my prisoned spirit to thy soul!
104,REDEMPTION,
105,REDEMPTION,
106,REDEMPTION,
107,LOVESIGHT,LOVESIGHT
108,LOVESIGHT,
109,LOVESIGHT,"When do I see thee most, beloved one?"
110,LOVESIGHT,When in the light the spirits of mine eyes
111,LOVESIGHT,"Before thy face, their altar, solemnize"
112,LOVESIGHT,The worship of that Love through thee made known?
113,LOVESIGHT,"Or when in the dusk hours, (we two alone,)"
114,LOVESIGHT,Close-kissed and eloquent of still replies
115,LOVESIGHT,"Thy twilight-hidden glimmering visage lies,"
116,LOVESIGHT,And my soul only sees thy soul its own?
117,LOVESIGHT,
118,LOVESIGHT,"O love, my love! if I no more should see"
119,LOVESIGHT,"Thyself, nor on the earth the shadow of thee,"
120,LOVESIGHT,"Nor image of thine eyes in any spring,--"
121,LOVESIGHT,How then should sound upon Life's darkening slope
122,LOVESIGHT,"The ground-whirl of the perished leaves of Hope,"
123,LOVESIGHT,The wind of Death's imperishable wing?
124,LOVESIGHT,
125,LOVESIGHT,
126,LOVESIGHT,
127,HEART'S HOPE,HEART'S HOPE
128,HEART'S HOPE,
129,HEART'S HOPE,"By what word's power, the key of paths untrod,"
130,HEART'S HOPE,"Shall I the difficult deeps of Love explore,"
131,HEART'S HOPE,Till parted waves of Song yield up the shore
132,HEART'S HOPE,Even as that sea which Israel crossed dry-shod?
133,HEART'S HOPE,"For lo! in some poor rhythmic period,"
134,HEART'S HOPE,"Lady, I fain would tell how evermore"
135,HEART'S HOPE,"Thy soul I know not from thy body, nor"
136,HEART'S HOPE,"Thee from myself, neither our love from God."
137,HEART'S HOPE,
138,HEART'S HOPE,"Yea, in God's name, and Love's, and thine, would I"
139,HEART'S HOPE,Draw from one loving heart such evidence
140,HEART'S HOPE,As to all hearts all things shall signify;
141,HEART'S HOPE,"Tender as dawn's first hill-fire, and intense"
142,HEART'S HOPE,"As instantaneous penetrating sense,"
143,HEART'S HOPE,"In Spring's birth-hour, of other Springs gone by."
144,HEART'S HOPE,
145,HEART'S HOPE,
146,HEART'S HOPE,
147,THE KISS,THE KISS
148,THE KISS,
149,THE KISS,What smouldering senses in death's sick delay
150,THE KISS,Or seizure of malign vicissitude
151,THE KISS,"Can rob this body of honour, or denude"
152,THE KISS,This soul of wedding-raiment worn to-day?
153,THE KISS,For lo! even now my lady's lips did play
154,THE KISS,With these my lips such consonant interlude
155,THE KISS,As laurelled Orpheus longed for when he wooed
156,THE KISS,The half-drawn hungering face with that last lay.
157,THE KISS,
158,THE KISS,"I was a child beneath her touch,--a man"
159,THE KISS,"When breast to breast we clung, even I and she,--"
160,THE KISS,"A spirit when her spirit looked through me,--"
161,THE KISS,A god when all our life-breath met to fan
162,THE KISS,"Our life-blood, till love's emulous ardours ran,"
163,THE KISS,"Fire within fire, desire in deity.*"
164,THE KISS,
165,THE KISS,*[sic]
166,THE KISS,
167,THE KISS,
168,THE KISS,
169,NUPTIAL SLEEP,NUPTIAL SLEEP
170,NUPTIAL SLEEP,
171,NUPTIAL SLEEP,"At length their long kiss severed, with sweet smart:"
172,NUPTIAL SLEEP,And as the last slow sudden drops are shed
173,NUPTIAL SLEEP,"From sparkling eaves when all the storm has fled,"
174,NUPTIAL SLEEP,So singly flagged the pulses of each heart.
175,NUPTIAL SLEEP,"Their bosoms sundered, with the opening start"
176,NUPTIAL SLEEP,Of married flowers to either side outspread
177,NUPTIAL SLEEP,"From the knit stem; yet still their mouths, burnt red,"
178,NUPTIAL SLEEP,Fawned on each other where they lay apart.
179,NUPTIAL SLEEP,
180,NUPTIAL SLEEP,"Sleep sank them lower than the tide of dreams,"
181,NUPTIAL SLEEP,"And their dreams watched them sink, and slid away."
182,NUPTIAL SLEEP,"Slowly their souls swam up again, through gleams"
183,NUPTIAL SLEEP,Of watered light and dull drowned waifs of day;
184,NUPTIAL SLEEP,Till from some wonder of new woods and streams
185,NUPTIAL SLEEP,"He woke, and wondered more: for there she lay."
186,NUPTIAL SLEEP,
187,NUPTIAL SLEEP,
188,NUPTIAL SLEEP,
189,SUPREME SURRENDER,SUPREME SURRENDER
190,SUPREME SURRENDER,
191,SUPREME SURRENDER,O all the spirits of love that wander by
192,SUPREME SURRENDER,Along the love-sown fallowfield of sleep
193,SUPREME SURRENDER,My lady lies apparent; and the deep
194,SUPREME SURRENDER,Calls to the deep; and no man sees but I.
195,SUPREME SURRENDER,"The bliss so long afar, at length so nigh,"
196,SUPREME SURRENDER,Rests there attained. Methinks proud Love must weep
197,SUPREME SURRENDER,When Fate's control doth from his harvest reap
198,SUPREME SURRENDER,The sacred hour for which the years did sigh.
199,SUPREME SURRENDER,
200,SUPREME SURRENDER,"First touched, the hand now warm around my neck"
201,SUPREME SURRENDER,Taught memory long to mock desire: and lo!
202,SUPREME SURRENDER,"Across my breast the abandoned hair doth flow,"
203,SUPREME SURRENDER,Where one shorn tress long stirred the longing ache:
204,SUPREME SURRENDER,And next the heart that trembled for its sake
205,SUPREME SURRENDER,Lies the queen-heart in sovereign overthrow.
206,SUPREME SURRENDER,
207,SUPREME SURRENDER,
208,SUPREME SURRENDER,
209,LOVE'S LOVERS,LOVE'S LOVERS
210,LOVE'S LOVERS,
211,LOVE'S LOVERS,Some ladies love the jewels in Love's zone
212,LOVE'S LOVERS,And gold-tipped darts he hath for painless play
213,LOVE'S LOVERS,In idle scornful hours he flings away;
214,LOVE'S LOVERS,And some that listen to his lure's soft tone
215,LOVE'S LOVERS,Do love to deem the silver praise their own;
216,LOVE'S LOVERS,Some prize his blindfold sight; and there be they
217,LOVE'S LOVERS,Who kissed his wings which brought him yesterday
218,LOVE'S LOVERS,And thank his wings to-day that he is flown.
219,LOVE'S LOVERS,
220,LOVE'S LOVERS,My lady only loves the heart of Love:
221,LOVE'S LOVERS,"Therefore Love's heart, my lady, hath for thee"
222,LOVE'S LOVERS,His bower of unimagined flower and tree:
223,LOVE'S LOVERS,"There kneels he now, and all-anhungered of"
224,LOVE'S LOVERS,"Thine eyes grey-lit in shadowing hair above,"
225,LOVE'S LOVERS,Seals with thy mouth his immortality.
226,LOVE'S LOVERS,
227,LOVE'S LOVERS,
228,LOVE'S LOVERS,
229,PASSION AND WORSHIP,PASSION AND WORSHIP
230,PASSION AND WORSHIP,
231,PASSION AND WORSHIP,One flame-winged brought a white-winged harp-player
232,PASSION AND WORSHIP,Even where my lady and I lay all alone;
233,PASSION AND WORSHIP,"Saying: 'Behold, this minstrel is unknown;"
234,PASSION AND WORSHIP,"Bid him depart, for I am minstrel here:"
235,PASSION AND WORSHIP,"Only my strains are to Love's dear ones, dear.'"
236,PASSION AND WORSHIP,Then said I: 'Through thine hautboy's rapturous tone
237,PASSION AND WORSHIP,"Unto my lady still this harp makes moan,"
238,PASSION AND WORSHIP,And still she deems the cadence deep and clear.'
239,PASSION AND WORSHIP,
240,PASSION AND WORSHIP,"Then said my lady: 'Thou art Passion of Love,"
241,PASSION AND WORSHIP,And this Love's Worship: both he plights to me.
242,PASSION AND WORSHIP,Thy mastering music walks the sunlit sea:
243,PASSION AND WORSHIP,But where wan water trembles in the grove
244,PASSION AND WORSHIP,"And the wan moon is all the light thereof,"
245,PASSION AND WORSHIP,This harp still makes my name its voluntary.'
246,PASSION AND WORSHIP,
247,PASSION AND WORSHIP,
248,PASSION AND WORSHIP,
249,THE PORTRAIT,THE PORTRAIT
250,THE PORTRAIT,
251,THE PORTRAIT,"O Lord of all compassionate control,"
252,THE PORTRAIT,O Love! let this my lady's picture glow
253,THE PORTRAIT,"Under my hand to praise her name, and show"
254,THE PORTRAIT,Even of her inner self the perfect whole:
255,THE PORTRAIT,"That he who seeks her beauty's furthest goal,"
256,THE PORTRAIT,Beyond the light that the sweet glances throw
257,THE PORTRAIT,"And refluent wave of the sweet smile, may know"
258,THE PORTRAIT,The very sky and sea-line of her soul.
259,THE PORTRAIT,
260,THE PORTRAIT,Lo! it is done. Above the long lithe throat
261,THE PORTRAIT,"The mouth's mould testifies of voice and kiss,"
262,THE PORTRAIT,The shadowed eyes remember and foresee.
263,THE PORTRAIT,Her face is made her shrine. Let all men note
264,THE PORTRAIT,"That in all years (O Love, thy gift is this!)"
265,THE PORTRAIT,They that would look on her must come to me.
266,THE PORTRAIT,
267,THE PORTRAIT,
268,THE PORTRAIT,
269,THE LOVE-LETTER,THE LOVE-LETTER
270,THE LOVE-LETTER,
271,THE LOVE-LETTER,Warmed by her hand and shadowed by her hair
272,THE LOVE-LETTER,"As close she leaned and poured her heart through thee,"
273,THE LOVE-LETTER,Whereof the articulate throbs accompany
274,THE LOVE-LETTER,"The smooth black stream that makes thy whiteness fair,--"
275,THE LOVE-LETTER,"Sweet fluttering sheet, even of her breath aware,--"
276,THE LOVE-LETTER,Oh let thy silent song disclose to me
277,THE LOVE-LETTER,That soul wherewith her lips and eyes agree
278,THE LOVE-LETTER,Like married music in Love's answering air.
279,THE LOVE-LETTER,
280,THE LOVE-LETTER,"Fain had I watched her when, at some fond thought,"
281,THE LOVE-LETTER,"Her bosom to the writing closelier press'd,"
282,THE LOVE-LETTER,And her breast's secrets peered into her breast;
283,THE LOVE-LETTER,"When, through eyes raised an instant, her soul sought"
284,THE LOVE-LETTER,"My soul, and from the sudden confluence caught"
285,THE LOVE-LETTER,The words that made her love the loveliest.
286,THE LOVE-LETTER,
287,THE LOVE-LETTER,
288,THE LOVE-LETTER,
289,THE LOVERS' WALK,THE LOVERS' WALK
290,THE LOVERS' WALK,
291,THE LOVERS' WALK,Sweet twining hedgeflowers wind-stirred in no wise
292,THE LOVERS' WALK,On this June day; and hand that clings in hand:--
293,THE LOVERS' WALK,Still glades; and meeting faces scarcely fann'd:--
294,THE LOVERS' WALK,An osier-odoured stream that draws the skies
295,THE LOVERS' WALK,Deep to its heart; and mirrored eyes in eyes:--
296,THE LOVERS' WALK,Fresh hourly wonder o'er the Summer land
297,THE LOVERS' WALK,Of light and cloud; and two souls softly spann'd
298,THE LOVERS' WALK,With one o'erarching heaven of smiles and sighs:--
299,THE LOVERS' WALK,
300,THE LOVERS' WALK,"Even such their path, whose bodies lean unto"
301,THE LOVERS' WALK,"Each other's visible sweetness amorously,--"
302,THE LOVERS' WALK,Whose passionate hearts lean by Love's high decree
303,THE LOVERS' WALK,"Together on his heart for ever true,"
304,THE LOVERS' WALK,As the cloud-foaming firmamental blue
305,THE LOVERS' WALK,Rests on the blue line of a foamless sea.
306,THE LOVERS' WALK,
307,THE LOVERS' WALK,
308,THE LOVERS' WALK,
309,ANTIPHONY,ANTIPHONY
310,ANTIPHONY,
311,ANTIPHONY,"'I love you, sweet: how can you ever learn"
312,ANTIPHONY,"How much I love you?' 'You I love even so,"
313,ANTIPHONY,"And so I learn it.' 'Sweet, you cannot know"
314,ANTIPHONY,How fair you are.' 'If fair enough to earn
315,ANTIPHONY,"Your love, so much is all my love's concern.'"
316,ANTIPHONY,"'My love grows hourly, sweet.' 'Mine too doth grow,"
317,ANTIPHONY,Yet love seemed full so many hours ago!'
318,ANTIPHONY,"Thus lovers speak, till kisses claim their turn."
319,ANTIPHONY,
320,ANTIPHONY,Ah! happy they to whom such words as these
321,ANTIPHONY,"In youth have served for speech the whole day long,"
322,ANTIPHONY,"Hour after hour, remote from the world's throng,"
323,ANTIPHONY,"Work, contest, fame, all life's confederate pleas,--"
324,ANTIPHONY,What while Love breathed in sighs and silences
325,ANTIPHONY,Through two blent souls one rapturous undersong.
326,ANTIPHONY,
327,ANTIPHONY,

329,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE
330,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,
331,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,On this sweet bank your head thrice sweet and dear
332,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,"I lay, and spread your hair on either side,"
333,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,And see the newborn wood flowers bashful-eyed
334,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,Look through the golden tresses here and there.
335,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,On these debateable* borders of the year
336,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,Spring's foot half falters; scarce she yet may know
337,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,The leafless blackthorn-blossom from the snow;
338,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,And through her bowers the wind's way still is clear.
339,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,
340,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,But April's sun strikes down the glades to-day;
341,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,"So shut your eyes upturned, and feel my kiss"
342,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,"Creep, as the Spring now thrills through every spray,"
343,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,Up your warm throat to your warm lips: for this
344,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,"Is even the hour of Love's sworn suitservice,"
345,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,With whom cold hearts are counted castaway.
346,YOUTH'S SPRING-TRIBUTE,

351,THE BIRTH-BOND,THE BIRTH-BOND
352,THE BIRTH-BOND,
353,THE BIRTH-BOND,"Have you not noted, in some family"
354,THE BIRTH-BOND,"Where two were born of a first marriage-bed,"
355,THE BIRTH-BOND,"How still they own their gracious bond, though fed"
356,THE BIRTH-BOND,And nursed on the forgotten breast and knee?--
357,THE BIRTH-BOND,How to their father's children they shall be
358,THE BIRTH-BOND,In act and thought of one goodwill; but each
359,THE BIRTH-BOND,"Shall for the other have, in silence speech,"
360,THE BIRTH-BOND,And in a word complete community?
361,THE BIRTH-BOND,
362,THE BIRTH-BOND,"Even so, when first I saw you, seemed it, love,"
363,THE BIRTH-BOND,That among souls allied to mine was yet
364,THE BIRTH-BOND,One nearer kindred than life hinted of.
365,THE BIRTH-BOND,"O born with me somewhere that men forget,"
366,THE BIRTH-BOND,"And though in years of sight and sound unmet,"
367,THE BIRTH-BOND,Known for my soul's birth-partner well enough!
368,THE BIRTH-BOND,

371,A DAY OF LOVE,A DAY OF LOVE
372,A DAY OF LOVE,
373,A DAY OF LOVE,"Those envied places which do know her well,"
374,A DAY OF LOVE,"And are so scornful of this lonely place,"
375,A DAY OF LOVE,Even now for once are emptied of her grace:
376,A DAY OF LOVE,Nowhere but here she is: and while Love's spell
377,A DAY OF LOVE,From his predominant presence doth compel
378,A DAY OF LOVE,"All alien hours, an outworn populace,"
379,A DAY OF LOVE,The hours of Love fill full the echoing space
380,A DAY OF LOVE,With sweet confederate music favourable.
381,A DAY OF LOVE,
382,A DAY OF LOVE,Now many memories make solicitous
383,A DAY OF LOVE,"The delicate love-lines of her mouth, till, lit"
384,A DAY OF LOVE,"With quivering fire, the words take wing from it;"
385,A DAY OF LOVE,As here between our kisses we sit thus
386,A DAY OF LOVE,"Speaking of things remembered, and so sit"
387,A DAY OF LOVE,Speechless while things forgotten call to us.

393,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,"What dawn-pulse at the heart of heaven, or last"
394,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,"Incarnate flower of culminating day,--"
395,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,"What marshalled marvels on the skirts of May,"
396,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,"Or song full-quired, sweet June's encomiast;"
397,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,What glory of change by nature's hand amass'd
398,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,Can vie with all those moods of varying grace
399,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,Which o'er one loveliest woman's form and face
400,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,"Within this hour, within this room, have pass'd?"
401,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,
402,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,Love's very vesture and elect disguise
403,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,"Was each fine movement,--wonder new-begot"
404,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,Of lily or swan or swan-stemmed galiot;
405,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,"Joy to his sight who now the sadlier sighs,"
406,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,Parted again; and sorrow yet for eyes
407,BEAUTY'S PAGEANT,Unborn that read these words and saw her not.

412,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,
413,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,Beauty like hers is genius. Not the call
414,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,"Of Homer's or of Dante's heart sublime,--"
415,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,"Not Michael's hand furrowing the zones of time,--"
416,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,Is more with compassed mysteries musical;
417,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,"Nay, not in Spring's or Summer's sweet footfall"
418,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,More gathered gifts exuberant Life bequeathes*
419,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,"Than doth this sovereign face, whose love-spell breathes"
420,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,Even from its shadowed contour on the wall.
421,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,
422,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,"As many men are poets in their youth,"
423,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,But for one sweet-strung soul the wires prolong
424,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,Even through all change the indomitable song;
425,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,"So in likewise the envenomed years, whose tooth"
426,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,"Rends shallower grace with ruin void of ruth,"
427,GENIUS IN BEAUTY,Upon this beauty's power shall wreak no wrong.

435,SILENT NOON,"Your hands lie open in the long fresh grass,--"

1039,I,"Leaning across the water, I and he;"
1040,I,"Nor ever did he speak nor looked at me,"
1041,I,But touched his lute wherein was audible
1042,I,The certain secret thing he had to tell:
1043,I,Only our mirrored eyes met silently
1044,I,In the low wave; and that sound came to be
1045,I,The passionate voice I knew; and my tears fell.
1046,I,
1047,I,"And at their fall, his eyes beneath grew hers;"
1048,I,And with his foot and with his wing-feathers
1049,I,He swept the spring that watered my heart's drouth.
1050,I,"Then the dark ripples spread to waving hair,"
1051,I,"And as I stooped, her own lips rising there"

1059,II,As souls disused in death's sterility
1060,II,May sing when the new birthday tarries long.
1061,II,And I was made aware of a dumb throng
1062,II,"That stood aloof, one form by every tree,"
1063,II,"All mournful forms, for each was I or she,"
1064,II,The shades of those our days that had no tongue.
1065,II,
1066,II,"They looked on us, and knew us and were known;"
1067,II,"While fast together, alive from the abyss,"
1068,II,Clung the soul-wrung implacable close kiss;
1069,II,And pity of self through all made broken moan
1070,II,"Which said, 'For once, for once, for once alone!'"
1071,II,"And still Love sang, and what he sang was this:--"

1074,III,III
1075,III,
1076,III,"'O ye, all ye that walk in Willow-wood,"

1079,III,"What long, what longer hours, one lifelong night,"

1087,III,Alas! if ever such a pillow could
1088,III,"Steep deep the soul in sleep till she were dead,--"
1089,III,"Better all life forget her than this thing,"
1090,III,That Willowwood should hold her wandering!'
1091,III,
1092,III,
1093,IV,IV
1094,IV,

1097,IV,"Nor change at once, yet near the end of day"
1098,IV,"The leaves drop loosened where the heart-stain glows,--"
1099,IV,So when the song died did the kiss unclose;
1100,IV,"And her face fell back drowned, and was as grey"
1101,IV,As its grey eyes; and if it ever may
1102,IV,Meet mine again I know not if Love knows.
1103,IV,
1104,IV,Only I know that I leaned low and drank
1105,IV,"A long draught from the water where she sank,"
1106,IV,Her breath and all her tears and all her soul:
1107,IV,"And as I leaned, I know I felt Love's face"

2025,HE AND I,The name his bitter silence knows it by?
2026,HE AND I,This was the little fold of separate sky
2027,HE AND I,Whose pasturing clouds in the soul's atmosphere
2028,HE AND I,Drew living light from one continual year:
2029,HE AND I,"How should he find it lifeless? He, or I?"
2030,HE AND I,
2031,HE AND I,"Lo! this new Self now wanders round my field,"
2032,HE AND I,"With plaints for every flower, and for each tree"
2033,HE AND I,"A moan, the sighing wind's auxiliary:"
2034,HE AND I,"And o'er sweet waters of my life, that yield"
2035,HE AND I,"Unto his lips no draught but tears unseal'd,"
2036,HE AND I,"Even in my place he weeps.  Even I, not he."

2043,I,
2044,I,To-day Death seems to me an infant child
2045,I,Which her worn mother Life upon my knee
2046,I,Has set to grow my friend and play with me;
2047,I,If haply so my heart might be beguil'd
2048,I,"To find no terrors in a face so mild,--"
2049,I,If haply so my weary heart might be
2050,I,"Unto the newborn milky eyes of thee,"
2051,I,"O Death, before resentment reconcil'd."
2052,I,
2053,I,"How long, O Death? And shall thy feet depart"
2054,I,"Still a young child's with mine, or wilt thou stand"
2055,I,"Fullgrown the helpful daughter of my heart,"
2056,I,What time with thee indeed I reach the strand
2057,I,"Of the pale wave which knows thee what thou art,"
2058,I,And drink it in the hollow of thy hand?

2064,II,"With whom, when our first heart beat full and fast,"
2065,II,"I wandered till the haunts of men were pass'd,"
2066,II,And in fair places found all bowers amiss
2067,II,"Till only woods and waves might hear our kiss,"
2068,II,While to the winds all thought of Death we cast:
2069,II,"Ah, Life! and must I have from thee at last"
2070,II,No smile to greet me and no babe but this?
2071,II,
2072,II,"Lo! Love, the child once ours; and Song, whose hair"
2073,II,Blew like a flame and blossomed like a wreath;
2074,II,"And Art, whose eyes were worlds by God found fair;"
2075,II,These o'er the book of Nature mixed their breath
2076,II,"With neck-twined arms, as oft we watched them there:"
2077,II,And did these die that thou mightst bear me Death?

2084,THE ONE HOPE,"Go hand in hand to death, and all is vain,"
2085,THE ONE HOPE,What shall assuage the unforgotten pain
2086,THE ONE HOPE,And teach the unforgetful to forget?
2087,THE ONE HOPE,"Shall Peace be still a sunk stream long unmet,--"
2088,THE ONE HOPE,Or may the soul at once in a green plain
2089,THE ONE HOPE,Stoop through the spray of some sweet life-fountain
2090,THE ONE HOPE,And cull the dew-drenched flowering amulet?
2091,THE ONE HOPE,
2092,THE ONE HOPE,Ah! when the wan soul in that golden air
2093,THE ONE HOPE,Between the scriptured petals softly blown
2094,THE ONE HOPE,"Peers breathless for the gift of grace unknown,"
2095,THE ONE HOPE,Ah! let none other written spell soe'er
2096,THE ONE HOPE,"But only the one Hope's one name be there,--"
2097,THE ONE HOPE,"Not less nor more, but even that word alone."
