83,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"The almond branch all turns to flower,"
84,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Though not a leaf is out, so she"
85,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,The bloom of life provoked in me
86,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"And, hard till then and selfish, I"
87,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Was thenceforth nought but sanctity
88,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,And service: life was mere delight
89,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"In being wholly good and right,"
90,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"As she was; just, without a slur;"
91,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Honouring myself no less than her;

96,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"For me, hence weak towards the weak,"
97,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,No more the unnested blackbird's shriek
98,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Startled the light-leaved wood; on high

106,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Was law, and that which keeps the law,"
107,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Cherubic gaiety and awe;
108,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Day was her doing, and the lark"
109,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Had reason for his song; the dark
110,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,In anagram innumerous spelt
111,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Her name with stars that throbb'd and felt;
112,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,'Twas the sad summit of delight
113,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,To wake and weep for her at night;
114,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,She turn'd to triumph or to shame
115,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,The strife of every childish game;
116,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,The heart would come into my throat
117,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"At rosebuds; howsoe'er remote,"
118,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"In opposition or consent,"
119,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Each thing, or person, or event,"

129,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Yet nowhere any moon or sun!
130,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"What reason for these sighs?  What hope,"
131,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Daunting with its audacious scope
132,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"The disconcerted heart, affects"
133,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,These ceremonies and respects?
134,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Why stratagems in everything?
135,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Why, why not kiss her in the ring?"
136,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"'Tis nothing strange that warriors bold,"
137,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Whose fierce, forecasting eyes behold"
138,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"The city they desire to sack,"
139,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Humbly begin their proud attack
140,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"By delving ditches two miles off,"
141,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Aware how the fair place would scoff
142,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"At hasty wooing; but, O child,"
143,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Why thus approach thy playmate mild?
144,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"One morning, when it flush'd my thought"
145,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"That, what in me such wonder wrought"
146,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Was call'd, in men and women, love,"
147,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"And, sick with vanity thereof,"
148,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"I, saying loud, 'I love her,' told"
149,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"My secret to myself, behold"
150,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,A crisis in my mystery!
151,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"For, suddenly, I seem'd to be"
152,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Whirl'd round, and bound with showers of threads,"
153,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,As when the furious spider sheds
154,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Captivity upon the fly
155,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,To still his buzzing till he die;
156,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Only, with me, the bonds that flew,"
157,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Enfolding, thrill'd me through and through"
158,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"With bliss beyond aught heaven can have,"
159,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,And pride to dream myself her slave.
160,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"A long, green slip of wilder'd land,"
161,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"With Knatchley Wood on either hand,"
162,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Sunder'd our home from hers.  This day
163,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Glad was I as I went her way.
164,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"I stretch'd my arms to the sky, and sprang"
165,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"O'er the elastic sod, and sang"
166,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"'I love her, love her!' to an air"
167,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Which with the words came then and there;
168,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"And even now, when I would know"
169,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"All was not always dull and low,"
170,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,I mind me awhile of the sweet strain
171,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Love taught me in that lonely lane.
172,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Such glories fade, with no more mark"
173,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Than when the sunset dies to dark.
174,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"They pass, the rapture and the grace"
175,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Ineffable, their only trace"
176,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"A heart which, having felt no less"
177,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Than pure and perfect happiness,"
178,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Is duly dainty of delight;
179,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"A patient, poignant appetite"
180,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,For pleasures that exceed so much
181,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,The poor things which the world calls such.
182,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"That, when these lure it, then you may"
183,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,The lion with a wisp of hay.
184,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"That Charlotte, whom we scarcely knew"
185,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"From Anne but by her ribbons blue,"
186,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Was loved, Anne less than look'd at, shows"
187,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,That liking still by favour goes!
188,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"This Love is a Divinity,"
189,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,And holds his high election free
190,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Of human merit; or let's say,"
191,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"A child by ladies call'd to play,"
192,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"But careless of their becks and wiles,"
193,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Till, seeing one who sits and smiles"
194,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Like any else, yet only charms,"
195,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,He cries to come into her arms.
196,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Then, for my Cousins, fear me not!"
197,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,None ever loved because he ought.
198,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Fatal were else this graceful house,"
199,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,So full of light from ladies' brows.
200,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,There's Mary; Heaven in her appears
201,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Like sunshine through the shower's bright tears;
202,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Mildred's of Earth, yet happier far"
203,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Than most men's thoughts of Heaven are;
204,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"But, for Honoria, Heaven and Earth"
205,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Seal'd amity in her sweet birth.
206,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,The noble Girl!  With whom she talks
207,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"She knights first with her smile; she walks,"
208,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Stands, dances, to such sweet effect,"
209,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Alone she seems to move erect.
210,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,The brightest and the chastest brow
211,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Rules o'er a cheek which seems to show
212,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"That love, as a mere vague suspense"
213,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Of apprehensive innocence,"
214,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Perturbs her heart; love without aim
215,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Or object, like the sunlit flame"
216,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"That in the Vestals' Temple glow'd,"
217,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Without the image of a god.
218,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,And this simplicity most pure
219,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,She sets off with no less allure
220,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Of culture, subtly skill'd to raise"
221,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"The power, the pride, and mutual praise"
222,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Of human personality
223,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Above the common sort so high,"
224,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,It makes such homely souls as mine
225,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Marvel how brightly life may shine.
226,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,How you would love her!  Even in dress
227,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,She makes the common mode express
228,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,New knowledge of what's fit so well
229,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,'Tis virtue gaily visible!
230,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Nay, but her silken sash to me"
231,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Were more than all morality,"
232,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Had not the old, sweet, feverous ill"
233,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Left me the master of my will!
234,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"So, Mother, feel at rest, and please"
235,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"To send my books on board.  With these,"
236,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"When I go hence, all idle hours"
237,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Shall help my pleasures and my powers.
238,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"I've time, you know, to fill my post,"
239,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,And yet make up for schooling lost
240,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,Through young sea-service.  They all speak
241,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"German with ease; and this, with Greek,"
242,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"(Which Dr. Churchill thought I knew,)"
243,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"And history, which I fail'd in too,"
244,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,"Will stop a gap I somewhat dread,"
245,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,After the happy life I've led
246,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,With these my friends; and sweet 'twill be
247,I.  FROM FREDERICK GRAHAM.,To abridge the space from them to me.

279,II.  FROM MRS. GRAHAM.,"Should pine for love, in love's embrace,"
280,II.  FROM MRS. GRAHAM.,Through having known a happier grace;
281,II.  FROM MRS. GRAHAM.,"And break with inward sighs your rest,"
282,II.  FROM MRS. GRAHAM.,"Because, though good, she's not the best?"
283,II.  FROM MRS. GRAHAM.,"You would, you think, be just and kind,"
284,II.  FROM MRS. GRAHAM.,And keep your counsel!  You will find

363,IV.  FROM FREDERICK.,"Oh, my dear Mother, I confess"

484,V.  FROM FREDERICK,"Therefore, through time's close pressure bold,"

499,V.  FROM FREDERICK,Her lovely gravity of light
500,V.  FROM FREDERICK,Was scatter'd into many smiles

776,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,Besides me none was near to mark
777,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,"His loud cry in the louder dark,"
778,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,"Dark, save when lightning show'd the deeps"
779,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,Standing about in stony heaps.
780,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,No time for choice!  A rope; a flash
781,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,That flamed as he rose; a dizzy splash;
782,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,"A strange, inopportune delight"
783,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,"Of mounting with the billowy might,"
784,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,"And falling, with a thrill again"
785,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,Of pleasure shot from feet to brain;
786,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,"And both paced deck, ere any knew"
787,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,"Our peril.  Round us press'd the crew,"
788,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,With wonder in the eyes of most.
789,IX.  FROM FREDERICK.,As if the man who had loved and lost

2258,II.  FROM LADY CLITHEROE TO MARY CHURCHILL.,Honoria asks

2304,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"A great deal, of the Lady's Maid,--"
2305,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,And went with Mrs. Vaughan to see
2306,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"The pictures, which appear'd to be"

2322,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"At night till I was safe upstairs,"
2323,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,I thought it wrong to be so shy
2324,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,Of being good when I was by.
2325,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"'Oh, you should humour him!' she said,"
2326,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,With her sweet voice and smile; and led

2329,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"She's only Nursery-Governess,"

2344,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"She fetch'd the children, who had dined;"
2345,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"And, taking one in either hand,"
2346,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,Show'd me how all the grounds were plann'd.
2347,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,The lovely garden gently slopes

2352,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"Frank tickled one, and took it out"

2355,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,And shaggy pony in the croft;
2356,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"And then he dragg'd us to a loft,"
2357,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"Where pigeons, as he push'd the door,"
2358,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"Fann'd clear a breadth of dusty floor,"
2359,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,And set us coughing.  I confess
2360,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,I trembled for my nice silk dress.
2361,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,I cannot think how Mrs. Vaughan
2362,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"Ventured with that which she had on,--"
2363,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"A mere white wrapper, with a few"
2364,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"Plain trimmings of a quiet blue,"
2365,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"But, oh, so pretty!  Then the bell"
2366,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,For dinner rang.  I look'd quite well
2367,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"('Quite charming,' were the words Fred said,)"
2368,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,With the new gown that I've had made

2370,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,He's so high-bred and lordly-like
2371,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,With Mrs. Vaughan!  He's not quite so
2372,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"At home with me; but that, you know,"
2373,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"I can't expect, or wish.  'Twould hurt,"
2374,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,And seem to mock at my desert.
2375,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,Not but that I'm a duteous wife
2376,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"To Fred; but, in another life,"
2377,III.  FROM JANE TO MRS. GRAHAM,"Where all are fair that have been true,"

3657,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Considers.  Equal and entire,"
3658,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Therein benevolence, desire,"
3659,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Elsewhere ill-join'd or found apart,"
3660,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Become the pulses of one heart,"
3661,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Which now contracts, and now dilates,"
3662,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And, both to the height exalting, mates"
3663,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Self-seeking to self-sacrifice.
3664,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Nay, in its subtle paradise"
3665,THE WEDDING SERMON.,(When purest) this one love unites
3666,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"All modes of these two opposites,"
3667,THE WEDDING SERMON.,All balanced in accord so rich
3668,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Who may determine which is which?
3669,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Chiefly God's Love does in it live,"
3670,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And nowhere else so sensitive;
3671,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"For each is all that the other's eye,"
3672,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"In the vague vast of Deity,"
3673,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Can comprehend and so contain
3674,THE WEDDING SERMON.,As still to touch and ne'er to strain
3675,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The fragile nerves of joy.  And then
3676,THE WEDDING SERMON.,'Tis such a wise goodwill to men
3677,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And politic economy
3678,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"As in a prosperous State we see,"
3679,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Where every plot of common land
3680,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Is yielded to some private hand
3681,THE WEDDING SERMON.,To fence about and cultivate.
3682,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Does narrowness its praise abate?
3683,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Nay, the infinite of man is found"
3684,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"But in the beating of its bound,"
3685,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And, if a brook its banks o'erpass,"

3692,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"No giddiest hope, no wildest guess"

3694,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Had dared to dream of its own worth,"
3695,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Till Heaven's bold sun-gleam lit the earth.
3696,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Christ's marriage with the Church is more,"
3697,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"My Children, than a metaphor."
3698,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The heaven of heavens is symbol'd where
3699,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The torch of Psyche flash'd despair.
3700,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"But here I speak of heights, and heights"
3701,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Are hardly scaled.  The best delights
3702,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of even this homeliest passion, are"
3703,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"In the most perfect souls so rare,"
3704,THE WEDDING SERMON.,That they who feel them are as men
3705,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Sailing the Southern ocean, when,"
3706,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"At midnight, they look up, and eye"
3707,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"The starry Cross, and a strange sky"
3708,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Of brighter stars; and sad thoughts come

3716,THE WEDDING SERMON.,In the doctrine of virginity!
3717,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Could lovers, at their dear wish, blend,"
3718,THE WEDDING SERMON.,'Twould kill the bliss which they intend;
3719,THE WEDDING SERMON.,For joy is love's obedience
3720,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Against the law of natural sense;
3721,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And those perpetual yearnings sweet
3722,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Of lives which dream that they can meet
3723,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Are given that lovers never may
3724,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Be without sacrifice to lay
3725,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"On the high altar of true love,"
3726,THE WEDDING SERMON.,With tears of vestal joy.  To move
3727,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Frantic, like comets to our bliss,"
3728,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Forgetting that we always miss,"
3729,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And so to seek and fly the sun,"
3730,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"By turns, around which love should run,"
3731,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Perverts the ineffable delight
3732,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Of service guerdon'd with full sight
3733,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And pathos of a hopeless want,"
3734,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"To an unreal victory's vaunt,"
3735,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And plaint of an unreal defeat.
3736,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Yet no less dangerous misconceit
3737,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"May also be of the virgin will,"
3738,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Whose goal is nuptial blessing still,"
3739,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And whose true being doth subsist,"
3740,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"There where the outward forms are miss'd,"
3741,THE WEDDING SERMON.,In those who learn and keep the sense
3742,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Divine of 'due benevolence,'"
3743,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Seeking for aye, without alloy"
3744,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of selfish thought, another's joy,"
3745,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And finding in degrees unknown
3746,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"That which in act they shunn'd, their own."
3747,THE WEDDING SERMON.,For all delights of earthly love
3748,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Are shadows of the heavens, and move"
3749,THE WEDDING SERMON.,As other shadows do; they flee
3750,THE WEDDING SERMON.,From him that follows them; and he
3751,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Who flies, for ever finds his feet"

3760,THE WEDDING SERMON.,So much as sweet and regular
3761,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Use of the good in which we are.
3762,THE WEDDING SERMON.,As when a man along the ways
3763,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Walks, and a sudden music plays,"
3764,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"His step unchanged, he steps in time,"
3765,THE WEDDING SERMON.,So let your Grace with Nature chime.
3766,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Her primal forces burst, like straws,"
3767,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The bonds of uncongenial laws.
3768,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Right life is glad as well as just,"
3769,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And, rooted strong in 'This I must,'"
3770,THE WEDDING SERMON.,It bears aloft the blossom gay
3771,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And zephyr-toss'd, of 'This I may;'"
3772,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Whereby the complex heavens rejoice
3773,THE WEDDING SERMON.,In fruits of uncommanded choice.
3774,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Be this your rule: seeking delight
3775,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Esteem success the test of right;
3776,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"For 'gainst God's will much may be done,"
3777,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"But nought enjoy'd, and pleasures none"
3778,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Exist, but, like to springs of steel,"
3779,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Active no longer than they feel
3780,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"The checks that make them serve the soul,"
3781,THE WEDDING SERMON.,They take their vigour from control.
3782,THE WEDDING SERMON.,A man need only keep but well
3783,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The Church's indispensable

3786,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Leave even his heavenly Father's awe,"
3787,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"At times, and His immaculate law,"
3788,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Construed in its extremer sense.
3789,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Jehovah's mild magnipotence
3790,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Smiles to behold His children play
3791,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"In their own free and childish way,"
3792,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And can His fullest praise descry
3793,THE WEDDING SERMON.,In the exuberant liberty
3794,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of those who, having understood"
3795,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"The glory of the Central Good,"
3796,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And how souls ne'er may match or merge,"
3797,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"But as they thitherward converge,"
3798,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Take in love's innocent gladness part
3799,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"With infantine, untroubled heart,"
3800,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And faith that, straight t'wards heaven's far Spring,"
3801,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Sleeps, like the swallow, on the wing."

3809,THE WEDDING SERMON.,For love to do but to sustain
3810,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The spousal hour's delighted gain.
3811,THE WEDDING SERMON.,But time and a right life alone
3812,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Fulfil the promise then foreshown.
3813,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The Bridegroom and the Bride withal
3814,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Are but unwrought material
3815,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of marriage; nay, so far is love,"
3816,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Thus crown'd, from being thereto enough,"
3817,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Without the long, compulsive awe"
3818,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of duty, that the bond of law"
3819,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Does oftener marriage-love evoke,"
3820,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Than love, which does not wear the yoke"
3821,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of legal vows, submits to be"
3822,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Self-rein'd from ruinous liberty.
3823,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Lovely is love; but age well knows
3824,THE WEDDING SERMON.,'Twas law which kept the lover's vows
3825,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Inviolate through the year or years
3826,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of worship pieced with panic fears,"
3827,THE WEDDING SERMON.,When she who lay within his breast
3828,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Seem'd of all women perhaps the best,"
3829,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"But not the whole, of womankind,"
3830,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Or love, in his yet wayward mind,"
3831,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Had ghastly doubts its precious life
3832,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Was pledged for aye to the wrong wife.
3833,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Could it be else?  A youth pursues
3834,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"A maid, whom chance, not he, did choose,"
3835,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Till to his strange arms hurries she
3836,THE WEDDING SERMON.,In a despair of modesty.
3837,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Then, simply and without pretence"
3838,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of insight or experience,"
3839,THE WEDDING SERMON.,They plight their vows.  The parents say
3840,THE WEDDING SERMON.,'We cannot speak them yea or nay;
3841,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The thing proceedeth from the Lord!'
3842,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And wisdom still approves their word;
3843,THE WEDDING SERMON.,For God created so these two
3844,THE WEDDING SERMON.,They match as well as others do
3845,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"That take more pains, and trust Him less"
3846,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Who never fails, if ask'd, to bless"
3847,THE WEDDING SERMON.,His children's helpless ignorance
3848,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And blind election of life's chance.
3849,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Verily, choice not matters much,"
3850,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"If but the woman's truly such,"
3851,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And the young man has led the life
3852,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Without which how shall e'er the wife
3853,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Be the one woman in the world?
3854,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Love's sensitive tendrils sicken, curl'd"
3855,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Round folly's former stay; for 'tis
3856,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The doom of all unsanction'd bliss
3857,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"To mock some good that, gain'd, keeps still"
3858,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The taint of the rejected ill.

3860,THE WEDDING SERMON.,
3861,THE WEDDING SERMON.,8
3862,THE WEDDING SERMON.,
3863,THE WEDDING SERMON.,
3864,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Howbeit, though both were perfect, she"
3865,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Of whom the maid was prophecy
3866,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"As yet lives not, and Love rebels"
3867,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Against the law of any else;
3868,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And, as a steed takes blind alarm,"
3869,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Disowns the rein, and hunts his harm,"
3870,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"So, misdespairing word and act"
3871,THE WEDDING SERMON.,May now perturb the happiest pact.
3872,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"The more, indeed, is love, the more"
3873,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Peril to love is now in store.
3874,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Against it nothing can be done
3875,THE WEDDING SERMON.,But only this: leave ill alone!
3876,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Who tries to mend his wife succeeds
3877,THE WEDDING SERMON.,As he who knows not what he needs.
3878,THE WEDDING SERMON.,He much affronts a worth as high
3879,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"As his, and that equality"
3880,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Of spirits in which abide the grace
3881,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And joy of her subjected place;
3882,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And does the still growth check and blur
3883,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of contraries, confusing her"
3884,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Who better knows what he desires
3885,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Than he, and to that mark aspires"
3886,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"With perfect zeal, and a deep wit"
3887,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Which nothing helps but trusting it.
3888,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"So, loyally o'erlooking all"
3889,THE WEDDING SERMON.,In which love's promise short may fall
3890,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of full performance, honour that"
3891,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"As won, which aye love worketh at!"
3892,THE WEDDING SERMON.,It is but as the pedigree
3893,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Of perfectness which is to be
3894,THE WEDDING SERMON.,That our best good can honour claim;
3895,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Yet honour to deny were shame
3896,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And robbery: for it is the mould
3897,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Wherein to beauty runs the gold
3898,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of good intention, and the prop"
3899,THE WEDDING SERMON.,That lifts to the sun the earth-drawn crop
3900,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Of human sensibilities.
3901,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Such honour, with a conduct wise"
3902,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"In common things, as, not to steep"
3903,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The lofty mind of love in sleep
3904,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Of over much familiarness;
3905,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Not to degrade its kind caress,"
3906,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"As those do that can feel no more,"
3907,THE WEDDING SERMON.,So give themselves to pleasures o'er;
3908,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Not to let morning-sloth destroy
3909,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"The evening-flower, domestic joy;"
3910,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Not by uxoriousness to chill
3911,THE WEDDING SERMON.,The warm devotion of her will
3912,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Who can but half her love confer
3913,THE WEDDING SERMON.,On him that cares for nought but her;--
3914,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"These, and like obvious prudencies"
3915,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Observed, he's safest that relies,"
3916,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"For the hope she will not always seem,"
3917,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Caught, but a laurel or a stream,"
3918,THE WEDDING SERMON.,On time; on her unsearchable
3919,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Love-wisdom; on their work done well,"
3920,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Discreet with mutual aid; on might
3921,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Of shared affliction and delight;
3922,THE WEDDING SERMON.,On pleasures that so childish be
3923,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"They're 'shamed to let the children see,"
3924,THE WEDDING SERMON.,By which life keeps the valleys low
3925,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Where love does naturally grow;
3926,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"On much whereof hearts have account,"
3927,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Though heads forget; on babes, chief fount"
3928,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of union, and for which babes are"
3929,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"No less than this for them, nay far"
3930,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"More, for the bond of man and wife"
3931,THE WEDDING SERMON.,To the very verge of future life
3932,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Strengthens, and yearns for brighter day,"
3933,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"While others, with their use, decay;"
3934,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And, though true marriage purpose keeps"
3935,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of offspring, as the centre sleeps"

3937,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Fury to the circumference,"
3938,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Love's self the noblest offspring is,"
3939,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And sanction of the nuptial kiss;
3940,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Lastly, on either's primal curse,"

4055,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Which lure to empty heights man's hope,"
4056,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Bepraising heaven's ethereal cope,"
4057,THE WEDDING SERMON.,But covering with their cloudy cant
4058,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Its ground of solid adamant,"
4059,THE WEDDING SERMON.,That strengthens ether for the flight
4060,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Of angels, makes and measures height,"
4061,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And in materiality
4062,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Exceeds our Earth's in such degree
4063,THE WEDDING SERMON.,As all else Earth exceeds!  Do I
4064,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Here utter aught too dark or high?
4065,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Have you not seen a bird's beak slay
4066,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Proud Psyche, on a summer's day?"
4067,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Down fluttering drop the frail wings four,"
4068,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Missing the weight which made them soar.
4069,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Spirit is heavy nature's wing,"
4070,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And is not rightly anything
4071,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Without its burthen, whereas this,"

4083,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And this, like all God's laws, is good;"
4084,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"For nought's so sad, the whole world o'er,"
4085,THE WEDDING SERMON.,As much love which has once been more.
4086,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Glorious for light is the earliest love;
4087,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"But worldly things, in the rays thereof,"
4088,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Extend their shadows, every one"
4089,THE WEDDING SERMON.,False as the image which the sun
4090,THE WEDDING SERMON.,At noon or eve dwarfs or protracts.

4097,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Perhaps she is not; the likelier wife!
4098,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"If it be thus; if you have known,"
4099,THE WEDDING SERMON.,(As who has not?) some heavenly one.
4100,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Whom the dull background of despair
4101,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Help'd to show forth supremely fair;
4102,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"If memory, still remorseful, shapes"
4103,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Young Passion bringing Eshcol grapes
4104,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"To travellers in the Wilderness,"
4105,THE WEDDING SERMON.,This truth will make regret the less:
4106,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Mighty in love as graces are,"

4108,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And he who is but just and kind
4109,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"And patient, shall for guerdon find,"
4110,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Before long, that the body's bond"
4111,THE WEDDING SERMON.,Is all else utterly beyond
4112,THE WEDDING SERMON.,In power of love to actualise
4113,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"The soul's bond which it signifies,"
4114,THE WEDDING SERMON.,And even to deck a wife with grace
4115,THE WEDDING SERMON.,External in the form and face.
4116,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"A five years' wife, and not yet fair?"
4117,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Blame let the man, not Nature, bear!"
4118,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"For, as the sun, warming a bank"
4119,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Where last year's grass droops gray and dank,"

4126,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"That trance of joy beyond all thought,"
4127,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"The vision, in one, of womanhood?"
4128,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Nay, for all women holding good,"
4129,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Should marriage such a prologue want,"

4131,THE WEDDING SERMON.,"Profanity; but, having this,"

4144,AMELIA.,Whene'er mine eyes do my Amelia greet
4145,AMELIA.,It is with such emotion
4146,AMELIA.,"As when, in childhood, turning a dim street,"
4147,AMELIA.,I first beheld the ocean.
4148,AMELIA.,"There, where the little, bright, surf-breathing town,"
4149,AMELIA.,"That shew'd me first her beauty and the sea,"
4150,AMELIA.,Gathers its skirts against the gorse-lit down
4151,AMELIA.,"And scatters gardens o'er the southern lea,"
4152,AMELIA.,Abides this Maid
4153,AMELIA.,"Within a kind, yet sombre Mother's shade,"
4154,AMELIA.,"Who of her daughter's graces seems almost afraid,"
4155,AMELIA.,"Viewing them ofttimes with a scared forecast,"
4156,AMELIA.,"Caught, haply, from obscure love-peril past."
4157,AMELIA.,"Howe'er that be,"
4158,AMELIA.,"She scants me of my right,"
4159,AMELIA.,Is cunning careful evermore to balk
4160,AMELIA.,"Sweet separate talk,"
4161,AMELIA.,And fevers my delight
4162,AMELIA.,"By frets, if, on Amelia's cheek of peach,"
4163,AMELIA.,"I touch the notes which music cannot reach,"
4164,AMELIA.,Bidding 'Good-night!'
4165,AMELIA.,"Wherefore it came that, till to-day's dear date,"
4166,AMELIA.,I curs'd the weary months which yet I have to wait
4167,AMELIA.,"Ere I find heaven, one-nested with my mate."
4168,AMELIA.,"To-day, the Mother gave,"
4169,AMELIA.,To urgent pleas and promise to behave
4170,AMELIA.,"As she were there, her long-besought consent"
4171,AMELIA.,To trust Amelia with me to the grave
4172,AMELIA.,"Where lay my once-betrothed, Millicent:"
4173,AMELIA.,"'For,' said she, hiding ill a moistening eye,"
4174,AMELIA.,"'Though, Sir, the word sounds hard,"
4175,AMELIA.,God makes as if He least knew how to guard
4176,AMELIA.,"The treasure He loves best, simplicity.'"
4177,AMELIA.,"And there Amelia stood, for fairness shewn"
4178,AMELIA.,"Like a young apple-tree, in flush'd array"
4179,AMELIA.,"Of white and ruddy flow'r, auroral, gay,"
4180,AMELIA.,With chilly blue the maiden branch between;
4181,AMELIA.,And yet to look on her moved less the mind
4182,AMELIA.,To say 'How beauteous!' than 'How good and kind!'
4183,AMELIA.,And so we went alone
4184,AMELIA.,By walls o'er which the lilac's numerous plume
4185,AMELIA.,Shook down perfume;
4186,AMELIA.,Trim plots close blown
4187,AMELIA.,"With daisies, in conspicuous myriads seen,"
4188,AMELIA.,Engross'd each one
4189,AMELIA.,"With single ardour for her spouse, the sun;"
4190,AMELIA.,Garths in their glad array
4191,AMELIA.,"Of white and ruddy branch, auroral, gay,"
4192,AMELIA.,With azure chill the maiden flow'r between;
4193,AMELIA.,"Meadows of fervid green,"
4194,AMELIA.,With sometime sudden prospect of untold
4195,AMELIA.,"Cowslips, like chance-found gold;"
4196,AMELIA.,"And broadcast buttercups at joyful gaze,"
4197,AMELIA.,"Rending the air with praise,"
4198,AMELIA.,Like the six-hundred-thousand-voiced shout
4199,AMELIA.,Of Jacob camp'd in Midian put to rout;
4200,AMELIA.,"Then through the Park,"
4201,AMELIA.,Where Spring to livelier gloom
4202,AMELIA.,"Quicken'd the cedars dark,"
4203,AMELIA.,"And, 'gainst the clear sky cold,"
4204,AMELIA.,Which shone afar
4205,AMELIA.,"Crowded with sunny alps oracular,"
4206,AMELIA.,Great chestnuts raised themselves abroad like cliffs of bloom;
4207,AMELIA.,"And everywhere,"
4208,AMELIA.,"Amid the ceaseless rapture of the lark,"
4209,AMELIA.,With wonder new
4210,AMELIA.,"We caught the solemn voice of single air,"
4211,AMELIA.,'Cuckoo!'
4212,AMELIA.,"And when Amelia, 'bolden'd, saw and heard"
4213,AMELIA.,"How bravely sang the bird,"
4214,AMELIA.,"And all things in God's bounty did rejoice,"
4215,AMELIA.,"She who, her Mother by, spake seldom word,"
4216,AMELIA.,"Did her charm'd silence doff,"
4217,AMELIA.,"And, to my happy marvel, her dear voice"
4218,AMELIA.,"Went as a clock does, when the pendulum's off."
4219,AMELIA.,Ill Monarch of man's heart the Maiden who
4220,AMELIA.,Does not aspire to be High-Pontiff too!
4221,AMELIA.,"So she repeated soft her Poet's line,"
4222,AMELIA.,"'By grace divine,"
4223,AMELIA.,"Not otherwise, O Nature, are we thine!'"
4224,AMELIA.,"And I, up the bright steep she led me, trod,"
4225,AMELIA.,And the like thought pursued
4226,AMELIA.,"With, 'What is gladness without gratitude,"
4227,AMELIA.,And where is gratitude without a God?'
4228,AMELIA.,"And of delight, the guerdon of His laws,"
4229,AMELIA.,"She spake, in learned mood;"
4230,AMELIA.,"And I, of Him loved reverently, as Cause,"
4231,AMELIA.,"Her sweetly, as Occasion of all good."
4232,AMELIA.,"Nor were we shy,"
4233,AMELIA.,For souls in heaven that be
4234,AMELIA.,May talk of heaven without hypocrisy.
4235,AMELIA.,"And now, when we drew near"
4236,AMELIA.,"The low, gray Church, in its sequester'd dell,"
4237,AMELIA.,A shade upon me fell.
4238,AMELIA.,"Dead Millicent indeed had been most sweet,"
4239,AMELIA.,But I how little meet
4240,AMELIA.,To call such graces in a Maiden mine!
4241,AMELIA.,A boy's proud passion free affection blunts;
4242,AMELIA.,"His well-meant flatteries oft are blind affronts,"
4243,AMELIA.,And many a tear
4244,AMELIA.,"Was Millicent's before I, manlier, knew"
4245,AMELIA.,That maidens shine
4246,AMELIA.,"As diamonds do,"
4247,AMELIA.,"Which, though most clear,"
4248,AMELIA.,Are not to be seen through;
4249,AMELIA.,"And, if she put her virgin self aside"
4250,AMELIA.,"And sate her, crownless, at my conquering feet,"
4251,AMELIA.,"It should have bred in me humility, not pride."
4252,AMELIA.,"Amelia had more luck than Millicent,"
4253,AMELIA.,Secure she smiled and warm from all mischance
4254,AMELIA.,"Or from my knowledge or my ignorance,"
4255,AMELIA.,And glow'd content
4256,AMELIA.,"With my--some might have thought too much--superior age,"
4257,AMELIA.,Which seem'd the gage
4258,AMELIA.,Of steady kindness all on her intent.
4259,AMELIA.,Thus nought forbade us to be fully blent.
4260,AMELIA.,"While, therefore, now"
4261,AMELIA.,Her pensive footstep stirr'd
4262,AMELIA.,"The darnell'd garden of unheedful death,"
4263,AMELIA.,"She ask'd what Millicent was like, and heard"
4264,AMELIA.,"Of eyes like her's, and honeysuckle breath,"
4265,AMELIA.,"And of a wiser than a woman's brow,"
4266,AMELIA.,"Yet fill'd with only woman's love, and how"
4267,AMELIA.,An incidental greatness character'd
4268,AMELIA.,Her unconsider'd ways.
4269,AMELIA.,But all my praise
4270,AMELIA.,Amelia thought too slight for Millicent
4271,AMELIA.,"And on my lovelier-freighted arm she leant,"
4272,AMELIA.,For more attent;
4273,AMELIA.,"And the tea-rose I gave,"
4274,AMELIA.,"To deck her breast, she dropp'd upon the grave."
4275,AMELIA.,"'And this was her's,' said I, decoring with a band"
4276,AMELIA.,Of mildest pearls Amelia's milder hand.
4277,AMELIA.,"'Nay, I will wear it for _her_ sake,' she said:"
4278,AMELIA.,For dear to maidens are their rivals dead.
4279,AMELIA.,"And so,"
4280,AMELIA.,"She seated on the black yew's tortured root,"
4281,AMELIA.,"I on the carpet of sere shreds below,"
4282,AMELIA.,"And nigh the little mound where lay that other,"
4283,AMELIA.,"I kiss'd her lips three times without dispute,"
4284,AMELIA.,"And, with bold worship suddenly aglow,"
4285,AMELIA.,"I lifted to my lips a sandall'd foot,"
4286,AMELIA.,And kiss'd it three times thrice without dispute.
4287,AMELIA.,"Upon my head her fingers fell like snow,"
4288,AMELIA.,Her lamb-like hands about my neck she wreathed.
4289,AMELIA.,"Her arms like slumber o'er my shoulders crept,"
4290,AMELIA.,"And with her bosom, whence the azalea breathed,"
4291,AMELIA.,"She did my face full favourably smother,"
4292,AMELIA.,To hide the heaving secret that she wept!
4293,AMELIA.,Now would I keep my promise to her Mother;
4294,AMELIA.,"Now I arose, and raised her to her feet,"
4295,AMELIA.,"My best Amelia, fresh-born from a kiss,"
4296,AMELIA.,"Moth-like, full-blown in birthdew shuddering sweet,"
4297,AMELIA.,"With great, kind eyes, in whose brown shade"
4298,AMELIA.,Bright Venus and her Baby play'd!
4299,AMELIA.,"At inmost heart well pleased with one another,"
4300,AMELIA.,What time the slant sun low
4301,AMELIA.,"Through the plough'd field does each clod sharply shew,"
4302,AMELIA.,And softly fills
4303,AMELIA.,"With shade the dimples of our homeward hills,"
4304,AMELIA.,"With little said,"
4305,AMELIA.,"We left the 'wilder'd garden of the dead,"
4306,AMELIA.,And gain'd the gorse-lit shoulder of the down
4307,AMELIA.,"That keeps the north-wind from the nestling town,"
4308,AMELIA.,"And caught, once more, the vision of the wave,"
4309,AMELIA.,"Where, on the horizon's dip,"
4310,AMELIA.,A many-sailed ship
4311,AMELIA.,Pursued alone her distant purpose grave;
4312,AMELIA.,"And, by steep steps rock-hewn, to the dim street"
4313,AMELIA.,I led her sacred feet;
4314,AMELIA.,"And so the Daughter gave,"
4315,AMELIA.,"Soft, moth-like, sweet,"
4316,AMELIA.,"Showy as damask-rose and shy as musk,"
4317,AMELIA.,"Back to her Mother, anxious in the dusk."
4318,AMELIA.,And now 'Good-night!'
4319,AMELIA.,Me shall the phantom months no more affright.
4320,AMELIA.,For heaven's gates to open well waits he
4321,AMELIA.,Who keeps himself the key.

4469,DEPARTURE.,'Twas all unlike your great and gracious ways.
