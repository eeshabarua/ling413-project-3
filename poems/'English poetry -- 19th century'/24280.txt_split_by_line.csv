37,PREFACE.,
38,PREFACE.,Knowing within myself the manner in which this Poem has been
39,PREFACE.,"produced, it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it"
40,PREFACE.,public.
41,PREFACE.,
42,PREFACE.,"What manner I mean, will be quite clear to the reader, who must soon"
43,PREFACE.,"perceive great inexperience, immaturity, and every error denoting a"
44,PREFACE.,"feverish attempt, rather than a deed accomplished. The two first"
45,PREFACE.,"books, and indeed the two last, I feel sensible are not of such"
46,PREFACE.,completion as to warrant their passing the press; nor should they if
47,PREFACE.,I thought a year's castigation would do them any good;--it will not:
48,PREFACE.,the foundations are too sandy. It is just that this youngster should
49,PREFACE.,"die away: a sad thought for me, if I had not some hope that while it"
50,PREFACE.,"is dwindling I may be plotting, and fitting myself for verses fit to"
51,PREFACE.,live.
52,PREFACE.,
53,PREFACE.,"This may be speaking too presumptuously, and may deserve a"
54,PREFACE.,punishment: but no feeling man will be forward to inflict it: he will
55,PREFACE.,"leave me alone, with the conviction that there is not a fiercer hell"
56,PREFACE.,than the failure in a great object. This is not written with the
57,PREFACE.,"least atom of purpose to forestall criticisms of course, but from the"
58,PREFACE.,"desire I have to conciliate men who are competent to look, and who do"
59,PREFACE.,"look with a zealous eye, to the honour of English literature."
60,PREFACE.,
61,PREFACE.,"The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a"
62,PREFACE.,"man is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the"
63,PREFACE.,"soul is in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life"
64,PREFACE.,"uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted: thence proceeds mawkishness,"
65,PREFACE.,and all the thousand bitters which those men I speak of must
66,PREFACE.,necessarily taste in going over the following pages.
67,PREFACE.,
68,PREFACE.,I hope I have not in too late a day touched the beautiful mythology
69,PREFACE.,"of Greece, and dulled its brightness: for I wish to try once more,"
70,PREFACE.,before I bid it farewel.

90,BOOK I.,
91,BOOK I.,A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
92,BOOK I.,Its loveliness increases; it will never
93,BOOK I.,Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
94,BOOK I.,"A bower quiet for us, and a sleep"
95,BOOK I.,"Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing."
96,BOOK I.,"Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing"
97,BOOK I.,"A flowery band to bind us to the earth,"
98,BOOK I.,"Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth"
99,BOOK I.,"Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,"
100,BOOK I.,Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways                    10
101,BOOK I.,"Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,"
102,BOOK I.,Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
103,BOOK I.,"From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,"
104,BOOK I.,"Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon"
105,BOOK I.,For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
106,BOOK I.,With the green world they live in; and clear rills
107,BOOK I.,That for themselves a cooling covert make
108,BOOK I.,"'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,"
109,BOOK I.,Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
110,BOOK I.,And such too is the grandeur of the dooms                      20
111,BOOK I.,We have imagined for the mighty dead;
112,BOOK I.,All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
113,BOOK I.,"An endless fountain of immortal drink,"
114,BOOK I.,Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
115,BOOK I.,
116,BOOK I.,Nor do we merely feel these essences
117,BOOK I.,"For one short hour; no, even as the trees"
118,BOOK I.,That whisper round a temple become soon
119,BOOK I.,"Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,"
120,BOOK I.,"The passion poesy, glories infinite,"
121,BOOK I.,Haunt us till they become a cheering light                     30
122,BOOK I.,"Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,"
123,BOOK I.,"That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,"
124,BOOK I.,"They alway must be with us, or we die."
125,BOOK I.,
126,BOOK I.,"Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I"
127,BOOK I.,Will trace the story of Endymion.
128,BOOK I.,The very music of the name has gone
129,BOOK I.,"Into my being, and each pleasant scene"
130,BOOK I.,Is growing fresh before me as the green
131,BOOK I.,Of our own vallies: so I will begin
132,BOOK I.,Now while I cannot hear the city's din;                        40
133,BOOK I.,"Now while the early budders are just new,"
134,BOOK I.,And run in mazes of the youngest hue
135,BOOK I.,About old forests; while the willow trails
136,BOOK I.,Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails
137,BOOK I.,"Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year"
138,BOOK I.,"Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer"
139,BOOK I.,"My little boat, for many quiet hours,"
140,BOOK I.,With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.
141,BOOK I.,"Many and many a verse I hope to write,"
142,BOOK I.,"Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,                  50"
143,BOOK I.,Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees
144,BOOK I.,"Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,"
145,BOOK I.,I must be near the middle of my story.
146,BOOK I.,"O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,"
147,BOOK I.,"See it half finished: but let Autumn bold,"
148,BOOK I.,"With universal tinge of sober gold,"
149,BOOK I.,Be all about me when I make an end.
150,BOOK I.,"And now at once, adventuresome, I send"
151,BOOK I.,My herald thought into a wilderness:
152,BOOK I.,"There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress                  60"
153,BOOK I.,"My uncertain path with green, that I may speed"
154,BOOK I.,"Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed."
155,BOOK I.,
156,BOOK I.,Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread
157,BOOK I.,A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed
158,BOOK I.,So plenteously all weed-hidden roots
159,BOOK I.,"Into o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits."
160,BOOK I.,"And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,"
161,BOOK I.,Where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep
162,BOOK I.,"A lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,"
163,BOOK I.,Never again saw he the happy pens                              70
164,BOOK I.,"Whither his brethren, bleating with content,"
165,BOOK I.,Over the hills at every nightfall went.
166,BOOK I.,"Among the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,"
167,BOOK I.,That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever
168,BOOK I.,"From the white flock, but pass'd unworried"
169,BOOK I.,"By angry wolf, or pard with prying head,"
170,BOOK I.,Until it came to some unfooted plains
171,BOOK I.,Where fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains
172,BOOK I.,"Who thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,"
173,BOOK I.,"Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,                  80"
174,BOOK I.,And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly
175,BOOK I.,"To a wide lawn, whence one could only see"
176,BOOK I.,Stems thronging all around between the swell
177,BOOK I.,Of turf and slanting branches: who could tell
178,BOOK I.,"The freshness of the space of heaven above,"
179,BOOK I.,Edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove
180,BOOK I.,"Would often beat its wings, and often too"
181,BOOK I.,A little cloud would move across the blue.
182,BOOK I.,
183,BOOK I.,Full in the middle of this pleasantness
184,BOOK I.,"There stood a marble altar, with a tress                       90"
185,BOOK I.,Of flowers budded newly; and the dew
186,BOOK I.,Had taken fairy phantasies to strew
187,BOOK I.,"Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,"
188,BOOK I.,And so the dawned light in pomp receive.
189,BOOK I.,For 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire
190,BOOK I.,Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre
191,BOOK I.,"Of brightness so unsullied, that therein"
192,BOOK I.,A melancholy spirit well might win
193,BOOK I.,"Oblivion, and melt out his essence fine"
194,BOOK I.,Into the winds: rain-scented eglantine                        100
195,BOOK I.,Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;
196,BOOK I.,The lark was lost in him; cold springs had run
197,BOOK I.,To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;
198,BOOK I.,Man's voice was on the mountains; and the mass
199,BOOK I.,"Of nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,"
200,BOOK I.,To feel this sun-rise and its glories old.
201,BOOK I.,
202,BOOK I.,Now while the silent workings of the dawn
203,BOOK I.,"Were busiest, into that self-same lawn"
204,BOOK I.,"All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped"
205,BOOK I.,A troop of little children garlanded;                         110
206,BOOK I.,"Who gathering round the altar, seemed to pry"
207,BOOK I.,Earnestly round as wishing to espy
208,BOOK I.,Some folk of holiday: nor had they waited
209,BOOK I.,"For many moments, ere their ears were sated"
210,BOOK I.,"With a faint breath of music, which ev'n then"
211,BOOK I.,"Fill'd out its voice, and died away again."
212,BOOK I.,Within a little space again it gave
213,BOOK I.,"Its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,"
214,BOOK I.,"To light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking"
215,BOOK I.,"Through copse-clad vallies,--ere their death, o'ertaking"
216,BOOK I.,The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.                          121
217,BOOK I.,
218,BOOK I.,"And now, as deep into the wood as we"
219,BOOK I.,"Might mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light"
220,BOOK I.,"Fair faces and a rush of garments white,"
221,BOOK I.,"Plainer and plainer shewing, till at last"
222,BOOK I.,"Into the widest alley they all past,"
223,BOOK I.,Making directly for the woodland altar.
224,BOOK I.,O kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter
225,BOOK I.,"In telling of this goodly company,"
226,BOOK I.,"Of their old piety, and of their glee:                        130"
227,BOOK I.,But let a portion of ethereal dew
228,BOOK I.,"Fall on my head, and presently unmew"
229,BOOK I.,"My soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,"
230,BOOK I.,To stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.
231,BOOK I.,
232,BOOK I.,"Leading the way, young damsels danced along,"
233,BOOK I.,Bearing the burden of a shepherd song;
234,BOOK I.,Each having a white wicker over brimm'd
235,BOOK I.,"With April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,"
236,BOOK I.,A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks
237,BOOK I.,As may be read of in Arcadian books;                          140
238,BOOK I.,"Such as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,"
239,BOOK I.,"When the great deity, for earth too ripe,"
240,BOOK I.,Let his divinity o'er-flowing die
241,BOOK I.,"In music, through the vales of Thessaly:"
242,BOOK I.,"Some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,"
243,BOOK I.,And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound
244,BOOK I.,"With ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,"
245,BOOK I.,"Now coming from beneath the forest trees,"
246,BOOK I.,"A venerable priest full soberly,"
247,BOOK I.,Begirt with ministring looks: alway his eye                   150
248,BOOK I.,"Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,"
249,BOOK I.,And after him his sacred vestments swept.
250,BOOK I.,"From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,"
251,BOOK I.,"Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;"
252,BOOK I.,And in his left he held a basket full
253,BOOK I.,Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:
254,BOOK I.,"Wild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still"
255,BOOK I.,"Than Leda's love, and cresses from the rill."
256,BOOK I.,"His aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,"
257,BOOK I.,Seem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth                        160
258,BOOK I.,Of winter hoar. Then came another crowd
259,BOOK I.,"Of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud"
260,BOOK I.,"Their share of the ditty. After them appear'd,"
261,BOOK I.,Up-followed by a multitude that rear'd
262,BOOK I.,"Their voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,"
263,BOOK I.,Easily rolling so as scarce to mar
264,BOOK I.,The freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:
265,BOOK I.,Who stood therein did seem of great renown
266,BOOK I.,"Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,"
267,BOOK I.,Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;                       170
268,BOOK I.,"And, for those simple times, his garments were"
269,BOOK I.,"A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,"
270,BOOK I.,"Was hung a silver bugle, and between"
271,BOOK I.,His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.
272,BOOK I.,"A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,"
273,BOOK I.,"To common lookers on, like one who dream'd"
274,BOOK I.,Of idleness in groves Elysian:
275,BOOK I.,But there were some who feelingly could scan
276,BOOK I.,"A lurking trouble in his nether lip,"
277,BOOK I.,And see that oftentimes the reins would slip                  180
278,BOOK I.,"Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,"
279,BOOK I.,"And think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,"
280,BOOK I.,"Of logs piled solemnly.--Ah, well-a-day,"
281,BOOK I.,Why should our young Endymion pine away!
282,BOOK I.,
283,BOOK I.,"Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,"
284,BOOK I.,Stood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd
285,BOOK I.,To sudden veneration: women meek
286,BOOK I.,Beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek
287,BOOK I.,Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.
288,BOOK I.,"Endymion too, without a forest peer,                          190"
289,BOOK I.,"Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,"
290,BOOK I.,Among his brothers of the mountain chase.
291,BOOK I.,"In midst of all, the venerable priest"
292,BOOK I.,"Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,"
293,BOOK I.,"And, after lifting up his aged hands,"
294,BOOK I.,"Thus spake he: ""Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!"
295,BOOK I.,Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:
296,BOOK I.,Whether descended from beneath the rocks
297,BOOK I.,That overtop your mountains; whether come
298,BOOK I.,From vallies where the pipe is never dumb;                    200
299,BOOK I.,"Or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs"
300,BOOK I.,"Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze"
301,BOOK I.,"Buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge"
302,BOOK I.,"Nibble their fill at ocean's very marge,"
303,BOOK I.,Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn
304,BOOK I.,By the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:
305,BOOK I.,Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare
306,BOOK I.,"The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;"
307,BOOK I.,And all ye gentle girls who foster up
308,BOOK I.,"Udderless lambs, and in a little cup                          210"
309,BOOK I.,Will put choice honey for a favoured youth:
310,BOOK I.,"Yea, every one attend! for in good truth"
311,BOOK I.,Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan.
312,BOOK I.,Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
313,BOOK I.,Night-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains
314,BOOK I.,Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains
315,BOOK I.,Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad
316,BOOK I.,Sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had
317,BOOK I.,Great bounty from Endymion our lord.
318,BOOK I.,The earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd                  220
319,BOOK I.,"His early song against yon breezy sky,"
320,BOOK I.,"That spreads so clear o'er our solemnity."""
321,BOOK I.,
322,BOOK I.,"Thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire"
323,BOOK I.,"Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;"
324,BOOK I.,Anon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod
325,BOOK I.,"With wine, in honour of the shepherd-god."
326,BOOK I.,"Now while the earth was drinking it, and while"
327,BOOK I.,"Bay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,"
328,BOOK I.,And gummy frankincense was sparkling bright
329,BOOK I.,"'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light                   230"
330,BOOK I.,"Spread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:"
331,BOOK I.,
332,BOOK I.,"""O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang"
333,BOOK I.,"From jagged trunks, and overshadoweth"
334,BOOK I.,"Eternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death"
335,BOOK I.,Of unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;
336,BOOK I.,Who lov'st to see the hamadryads dress
337,BOOK I.,Their ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;
338,BOOK I.,"And through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken"
339,BOOK I.,The dreary melody of bedded reeds--
340,BOOK I.,"In desolate places, where dank moisture breeds                240"
341,BOOK I.,The pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;
342,BOOK I.,"Bethinking thee, how melancholy loth"
343,BOOK I.,"Thou wast to lose fair Syrinx--do thou now,"
344,BOOK I.,By thy love's milky brow!
345,BOOK I.,"By all the trembling mazes that she ran,"
346,BOOK I.,"Hear us, great Pan!"
347,BOOK I.,
348,BOOK I.,"""O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles"
349,BOOK I.,"Passion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,"
350,BOOK I.,What time thou wanderest at eventide
351,BOOK I.,"Through sunny meadows, that outskirt the side                 250"
352,BOOK I.,"Of thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom"
353,BOOK I.,Broad leaved fig trees even now foredoom
354,BOOK I.,Their ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees
355,BOOK I.,Their golden honeycombs; our village leas
356,BOOK I.,Their fairest blossom'd beans and poppied corn;
357,BOOK I.,"The chuckling linnet its five young unborn,"
358,BOOK I.,To sing for thee; low creeping strawberries
359,BOOK I.,Their summer coolness; pent up butterflies
360,BOOK I.,"Their freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year"
361,BOOK I.,"All its completions--be quickly near,                         260"
362,BOOK I.,"By every wind that nods the mountain pine,"
363,BOOK I.,O forester divine!
364,BOOK I.,
365,BOOK I.,"""Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies"
366,BOOK I.,For willing service; whether to surprise
367,BOOK I.,The squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;
368,BOOK I.,Or upward ragged precipices flit
369,BOOK I.,To save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;
370,BOOK I.,Or by mysterious enticement draw
371,BOOK I.,Bewildered shepherds to their path again;
372,BOOK I.,"Or to tread breathless round the frothy main,                 270"
373,BOOK I.,And gather up all fancifullest shells
374,BOOK I.,"For thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,"
375,BOOK I.,"And, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;"
376,BOOK I.,"Or to delight thee with fantastic leaping,"
377,BOOK I.,The while they pelt each other on the crown
378,BOOK I.,"With silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown--"
379,BOOK I.,"By all the echoes that about thee ring,"
380,BOOK I.,"Hear us, O satyr king!"
381,BOOK I.,
382,BOOK I.,"""O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,"
383,BOOK I.,While ever and anon to his shorn peers                        280
384,BOOK I.,"A ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,"
385,BOOK I.,When snouted wild-boars routing tender corn
386,BOOK I.,"Anger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,"
387,BOOK I.,"To keep off mildews, and all weather harms:"
388,BOOK I.,"Strange ministrant of undescribed sounds,"
389,BOOK I.,"That come a swooning over hollow grounds,"
390,BOOK I.,And wither drearily on barren moors:
391,BOOK I.,Dread opener of the mysterious doors
392,BOOK I.,"Leading to universal knowledge--see,"
393,BOOK I.,"Great son of Dryope,                                          290"
394,BOOK I.,The many that are come to pay their vows
395,BOOK I.,With leaves about their brows!
396,BOOK I.,
397,BOOK I.,Be still the unimaginable lodge
398,BOOK I.,For solitary thinkings; such as dodge
399,BOOK I.,"Conception to the very bourne of heaven,"
400,BOOK I.,"Then leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,"
401,BOOK I.,That spreading in this dull and clodded earth
402,BOOK I.,Gives it a touch ethereal--a new birth:
403,BOOK I.,Be still a symbol of immensity;
404,BOOK I.,A firmament reflected in a sea;                               300
405,BOOK I.,An element filling the space between;
406,BOOK I.,An unknown--but no more: we humbly screen
407,BOOK I.,"With uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,"
408,BOOK I.,"And giving out a shout most heaven rending,"
409,BOOK I.,"Conjure thee to receive our humble Pæan,"
410,BOOK I.,Upon thy Mount Lycean!
411,BOOK I.,
412,BOOK I.,"Even while they brought the burden to a close,"
413,BOOK I.,"A shout from the whole multitude arose,"
414,BOOK I.,That lingered in the air like dying rolls
415,BOOK I.,"Of abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals                         310"
416,BOOK I.,Of dolphins bob their noses through the brine.
417,BOOK I.,"Meantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,"
418,BOOK I.,Young companies nimbly began dancing
419,BOOK I.,"To the swift treble pipe, and humming string."
420,BOOK I.,"Aye, those fair living forms swam heavenly"
421,BOOK I.,To tunes forgotten--out of memory:
422,BOOK I.,Fair creatures! whose young childrens' children bred
423,BOOK I.,"Thermopylæ its heroes--not yet dead,"
424,BOOK I.,But in old marbles ever beautiful.
425,BOOK I.,"High genitors, unconscious did they cull                      320"
426,BOOK I.,"Time's sweet first-fruits--they danc'd to weariness,"
427,BOOK I.,And then in quiet circles did they press
428,BOOK I.,"The hillock turf, and caught the latter end"
429,BOOK I.,"Of some strange history, potent to send"
430,BOOK I.,A young mind from its bodily tenement.
431,BOOK I.,"Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent"
432,BOOK I.,On either side; pitying the sad death
433,BOOK I.,"Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath"
434,BOOK I.,"Of Zephyr slew him,--Zephyr penitent,"
435,BOOK I.,"Who now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,                     330"
436,BOOK I.,Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.
437,BOOK I.,"The archers too, upon a wider plain,"
438,BOOK I.,"Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,"
439,BOOK I.,"And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft"
440,BOOK I.,"Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,"
441,BOOK I.,Call'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope
442,BOOK I.,"Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee"
443,BOOK I.,"And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,"
444,BOOK I.,"Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young"
445,BOOK I.,"Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue                  340"
446,BOOK I.,"Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,"
447,BOOK I.,"And very, very deadliness did nip"
448,BOOK I.,Her motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood
449,BOOK I.,"By one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,"
450,BOOK I.,"Uplifting his strong bow into the air,"
451,BOOK I.,Many might after brighter visions stare:
452,BOOK I.,"After the Argonauts, in blind amaze"
453,BOOK I.,"Tossing about on Neptune's restless ways,"
454,BOOK I.,"Until, from the horizon's vaulted side,"
455,BOOK I.,"There shot a golden splendour far and wide,                   350"
456,BOOK I.,Spangling those million poutings of the brine
457,BOOK I.,With quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine
458,BOOK I.,From the exaltation of Apollo's bow;
459,BOOK I.,A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.
460,BOOK I.,"Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,"
461,BOOK I.,Might turn their steps towards the sober ring
462,BOOK I.,Where sat Endymion and the aged priest
463,BOOK I.,"'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd"
464,BOOK I.,The silvery setting of their mortal star.
465,BOOK I.,There they discours'd upon the fragile bar                    360
466,BOOK I.,That keeps us from our homes ethereal;
467,BOOK I.,And what our duties there: to nightly call
468,BOOK I.,"Vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;"
469,BOOK I.,To summon all the downiest clouds together
470,BOOK I.,For the sun's purple couch; to emulate
471,BOOK I.,In ministring the potent rule of fate
472,BOOK I.,With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;
473,BOOK I.,"To tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons"
474,BOOK I.,"Sweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,"
475,BOOK I.,A world of other unguess'd offices.                           370
476,BOOK I.,"Anon they wander'd, by divine converse,"
477,BOOK I.,Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse
478,BOOK I.,Each one his own anticipated bliss.
479,BOOK I.,One felt heart-certain that he could not miss
480,BOOK I.,"His quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,"
481,BOOK I.,"Where every zephyr-sigh pouts, and endows"
482,BOOK I.,Her lips with music for the welcoming.
483,BOOK I.,"Another wish'd, mid that eternal spring,"
484,BOOK I.,"To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,"
485,BOOK I.,"Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:                380"
486,BOOK I.,"Who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,"
487,BOOK I.,And with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;
488,BOOK I.,"And, ever after, through those regions be"
489,BOOK I.,"His messenger, his little Mercury,"
490,BOOK I.,Some were athirst in soul to see again
491,BOOK I.,Their fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign
492,BOOK I.,"In times long past; to sit with them, and talk"
493,BOOK I.,Of all the chances in their earthly walk;
494,BOOK I.,"Comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores"
495,BOOK I.,"Of happiness, to when upon the moors,                         390"
496,BOOK I.,"Benighted, close they huddled from the cold,"
497,BOOK I.,And shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told
498,BOOK I.,"Their fond imaginations,--saving him"
499,BOOK I.,"Whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,"
500,BOOK I.,Endymion: yet hourly had he striven
501,BOOK I.,"To hide the cankering venom, that had riven"
502,BOOK I.,His fainting recollections. Now indeed
503,BOOK I.,His senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed
504,BOOK I.,"The sudden silence, or the whispers low,"
505,BOOK I.,"Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,                        400"
506,BOOK I.,"Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,"
507,BOOK I.,"Or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:"
508,BOOK I.,"But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,"
509,BOOK I.,Like one who on the earth had never slept.
510,BOOK I.,"Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,"
511,BOOK I.,Frozen in that old tale Arabian.
512,BOOK I.,
513,BOOK I.,Who whispers him so pantingly and close?
514,BOOK I.,"Peona, his sweet sister: of all those,"
515,BOOK I.,"His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,"
516,BOOK I.,And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade                    410
517,BOOK I.,"A yielding up, a cradling on her care."
518,BOOK I.,Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:
519,BOOK I.,"She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse"
520,BOOK I.,"Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,"
521,BOOK I.,"Along a path between two little streams,--"
522,BOOK I.,"Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,"
523,BOOK I.,"From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow"
524,BOOK I.,From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;
525,BOOK I.,"Until they came to where these streamlets fall,"
526,BOOK I.,"With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,                     420"
527,BOOK I.,"Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush"
528,BOOK I.,With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.
529,BOOK I.,"A little shallop, floating there hard by,"
530,BOOK I.,Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;
531,BOOK I.,"And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,"
532,BOOK I.,"And dipt again, with the young couple's weight,--"
533,BOOK I.,"Peona guiding, through the water straight,"
534,BOOK I.,Towards a bowery island opposite;
535,BOOK I.,"Which gaining presently, she steered light"
536,BOOK I.,"Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,                         430"
537,BOOK I.,"Where nested was an arbour, overwove"
538,BOOK I.,By many a summer's silent fingering;
539,BOOK I.,To whose cool bosom she was used to bring
540,BOOK I.,"Her playmates, with their needle broidery,"
541,BOOK I.,And minstrel memories of times gone by.
542,BOOK I.,
543,BOOK I.,So she was gently glad to see him laid
544,BOOK I.,"Under her favourite bower's quiet shade,"
545,BOOK I.,"On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,"
546,BOOK I.,Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves
547,BOOK I.,"When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,                   440"
548,BOOK I.,And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.
549,BOOK I.,Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:
550,BOOK I.,"But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest"
551,BOOK I.,"Peona's busy hand against his lips,"
552,BOOK I.,"And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips"
553,BOOK I.,In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps
554,BOOK I.,A patient watch over the stream that creeps
555,BOOK I.,"Windingly by it, so the quiet maid"
556,BOOK I.,Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade
557,BOOK I.,"Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling                      450"
558,BOOK I.,"Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling"
559,BOOK I.,"Among sere leaves and twigs, might all be heard."
560,BOOK I.,
561,BOOK I.,"O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,"
562,BOOK I.,That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind
563,BOOK I.,Till it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd
564,BOOK I.,Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key
565,BOOK I.,"To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,"
566,BOOK I.,"Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,"
567,BOOK I.,"Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves"
568,BOOK I.,"And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world                     460"
569,BOOK I.,"Of silvery enchantment!--who, upfurl'd"
570,BOOK I.,"Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,"
571,BOOK I.,"But renovates and lives?--Thus, in the bower,"
572,BOOK I.,Endymion was calm'd to life again.
573,BOOK I.,"Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,"
574,BOOK I.,"He said: ""I feel this thine endearing love"
575,BOOK I.,All through my bosom: thou art as a dove
576,BOOK I.,Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings
577,BOOK I.,About me; and the pearliest dew not brings
578,BOOK I.,"Such morning incense from the fields of May,                  470"
579,BOOK I.,As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray
580,BOOK I.,"From those kind eyes,--the very home and haunt"
581,BOOK I.,Of sisterly affection. Can I want
582,BOOK I.,"Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?"
583,BOOK I.,"Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears"
584,BOOK I.,"That, any longer, I will pass my days"
585,BOOK I.,"Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise"
586,BOOK I.,My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more
587,BOOK I.,Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:
588,BOOK I.,Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll             480
589,BOOK I.,Around the breathed boar: again I'll poll
590,BOOK I.,"The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:"
591,BOOK I.,"And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,"
592,BOOK I.,Again I'll linger in a sloping mead
593,BOOK I.,"To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed"
594,BOOK I.,"Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,"
595,BOOK I.,"And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat"
596,BOOK I.,"My soul to keep in its resolved course."""
597,BOOK I.,
598,BOOK I.,"Hereat Peona, in their silver source,"
599,BOOK I.,"Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,                 490"
600,BOOK I.,"And took a lute, from which there pulsing came"
601,BOOK I.,"A lively prelude, fashioning the way"
602,BOOK I.,In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay
603,BOOK I.,"More subtle cadenced, more forest wild"
604,BOOK I.,Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;
605,BOOK I.,And nothing since has floated in the air
606,BOOK I.,So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare
607,BOOK I.,"Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;"
608,BOOK I.,"For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd"
609,BOOK I.,"The quick invisible strings, even though she saw              500"
610,BOOK I.,Endymion's spirit melt away and thaw
611,BOOK I.,Before the deep intoxication.
612,BOOK I.,"But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon"
613,BOOK I.,"Her self-possession--swung the lute aside,"
614,BOOK I.,"And earnestly said: ""Brother, 'tis vain to hide"
615,BOOK I.,"That thou dost know of things mysterious,"
616,BOOK I.,"Immortal, starry; such alone could thus"
617,BOOK I.,Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught
618,BOOK I.,Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught
619,BOOK I.,A Paphian dove upon a message sent?                           510
620,BOOK I.,"Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,"
621,BOOK I.,"Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen"
622,BOOK I.,Her naked limbs among the alders green;
623,BOOK I.,"And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace"
624,BOOK I.,"Something more high perplexing in thy face!"""
625,BOOK I.,
626,BOOK I.,"Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,"
627,BOOK I.,"And said, ""Art thou so pale, who wast so bland"
628,BOOK I.,And merry in our meadows? How is this?
629,BOOK I.,Tell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!--
630,BOOK I.,Ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change                      520
631,BOOK I.,Wrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?
632,BOOK I.,Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?
633,BOOK I.,"Ambition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,"
634,BOOK I.,"That toiling years would put within my grasp,"
635,BOOK I.,That I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp
636,BOOK I.,No man e'er panted for a mortal love.
637,BOOK I.,So all have set my heavier grief above
638,BOOK I.,These things which happen. Rightly have they done:
639,BOOK I.,"I, who still saw the horizontal sun"
640,BOOK I.,"Heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,          530"
641,BOOK I.,"Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd"
642,BOOK I.,"My spear aloft, as signal for the chace--"
643,BOOK I.,"I, who, for very sport of heart, would race"
644,BOOK I.,With my own steed from Araby; pluck down
645,BOOK I.,A vulture from his towery perching; frown
646,BOOK I.,"A lion into growling, loth retire--"
647,BOOK I.,"To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,"
648,BOOK I.,And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast
649,BOOK I.,"Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest."
650,BOOK I.,
651,BOOK I.,"""This river does not see the naked sky,                     540"
652,BOOK I.,Till it begins to progress silverly
653,BOOK I.,"Around the western border of the wood,"
654,BOOK I.,"Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood"
655,BOOK I.,Seems at the distance like a crescent moon:
656,BOOK I.,"And in that nook, the very pride of June,"
657,BOOK I.,Had I been used to pass my weary eves;
658,BOOK I.,The rather for the sun unwilling leaves
659,BOOK I.,"So dear a picture of his sovereign power,"
660,BOOK I.,"And I could witness his most kingly hour,"
661,BOOK I.,"When he doth lighten up the golden reins,                     550"
662,BOOK I.,And paces leisurely down amber plains
663,BOOK I.,His snorting four. Now when his chariot last
664,BOOK I.,"Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,"
665,BOOK I.,There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed
666,BOOK I.,"Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red:"
667,BOOK I.,"At which I wondered greatly, knowing well"
668,BOOK I.,That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;
669,BOOK I.,"And, sitting down close by, began to muse"
670,BOOK I.,"What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,"
671,BOOK I.,"In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;                     560"
672,BOOK I.,"Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook"
673,BOOK I.,"Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,"
674,BOOK I.,Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth
675,BOOK I.,"Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,"
676,BOOK I.,Until my head was dizzy and distraught.
677,BOOK I.,"Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole"
678,BOOK I.,"A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;"
679,BOOK I.,And shaping visions all about my sight
680,BOOK I.,"Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;"
681,BOOK I.,"The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,"
682,BOOK I.,And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:                   571
683,BOOK I.,"And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell"
684,BOOK I.,The enchantment that afterwards befel?
685,BOOK I.,Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream
686,BOOK I.,"That never tongue, although it overteem"
687,BOOK I.,"With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,"
688,BOOK I.,Could figure out and to conception bring
689,BOOK I.,All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay
690,BOOK I.,"Watching the zenith, where the milky way"
691,BOOK I.,Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;                    580
692,BOOK I.,"And travelling my eye, until the doors"
693,BOOK I.,"Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,"
694,BOOK I.,I became loth and fearful to alight
695,BOOK I.,From such high soaring by a downward glance:
696,BOOK I.,"So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,"
697,BOOK I.,Spreading imaginary pinions wide.
698,BOOK I.,"When, presently, the stars began to glide,"
699,BOOK I.,"And faint away, before my eager view:"
700,BOOK I.,"At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,"
701,BOOK I.,And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;                   590
702,BOOK I.,"And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge"
703,BOOK I.,"The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er"
704,BOOK I.,A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar
705,BOOK I.,"So passionately bright, my dazzled soul"
706,BOOK I.,Commingling with her argent spheres did roll
707,BOOK I.,"Through clear and cloudy, even when she went"
708,BOOK I.,At last into a dark and vapoury tent--
709,BOOK I.,"Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train"
710,BOOK I.,Of planets all were in the blue again.
711,BOOK I.,"To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd                600"
712,BOOK I.,My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed
713,BOOK I.,"By a bright something, sailing down apace,"
714,BOOK I.,Making me quickly veil my eyes and face:
715,BOOK I.,"Again I look'd, and, O ye deities,"
716,BOOK I.,Who from Olympus watch our destinies!
717,BOOK I.,Whence that completed form of all completeness?
718,BOOK I.,Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?
719,BOOK I.,"Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O where"
720,BOOK I.,Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?
721,BOOK I.,Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;                  610
722,BOOK I.,"Not--thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun"
723,BOOK I.,"Such follying before thee--yet she had,"
724,BOOK I.,"Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;"
725,BOOK I.,"And they were simply gordian'd up and braided,"
726,BOOK I.,"Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,"
727,BOOK I.,"Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;"
728,BOOK I.,"The which were blended in, I know not how,"
729,BOOK I.,"With such a paradise of lips and eyes,"
730,BOOK I.,"Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,"
731,BOOK I.,"That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings                  620"
732,BOOK I.,"And plays about its fancy, till the stings"
733,BOOK I.,Of human neighbourhood envenom all.
734,BOOK I.,Unto what awful power shall I call?
735,BOOK I.,"To what high fane?--Ah! see her hovering feet,"
736,BOOK I.,"More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet"
737,BOOK I.,"Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose"
738,BOOK I.,From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows
739,BOOK I.,Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;
740,BOOK I.,"'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million"
741,BOOK I.,"Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,                  630"
742,BOOK I.,"Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,"
743,BOOK I.,"Handfuls of daisies.""--""Endymion, how strange!"
744,BOOK I.,"Dream within dream!""--""She took an airy range,"
745,BOOK I.,"And then, towards me, like a very maid,"
746,BOOK I.,"Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,"
747,BOOK I.,And press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;
748,BOOK I.,"Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,"
749,BOOK I.,"Yet held my recollection, even as one"
750,BOOK I.,Who dives three fathoms where the waters run
751,BOOK I.,"Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon,                          640"
752,BOOK I.,I felt upmounted in that region
753,BOOK I.,"Where falling stars dart their artillery forth,"
754,BOOK I.,And eagles struggle with the buffeting north
755,BOOK I.,That balances the heavy meteor-stone;--
756,BOOK I.,"Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,"
757,BOOK I.,But lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.
758,BOOK I.,"Soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,"
759,BOOK I.,And straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;
760,BOOK I.,Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd
761,BOOK I.,Huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:                   650
762,BOOK I.,"There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd"
763,BOOK I.,To faint once more by looking on my bliss--
764,BOOK I.,I was distracted; madly did I kiss
765,BOOK I.,"The wooing arms which held me, and did give"
766,BOOK I.,"My eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,"
767,BOOK I.,To take in draughts of life from the gold fount
768,BOOK I.,"Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count"
769,BOOK I.,"The moments, by some greedy help that seem'd"
770,BOOK I.,"A second self, that each might be redeem'd"
771,BOOK I.,And plunder'd of its load of blessedness.                     660
772,BOOK I.,"Ah, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press"
773,BOOK I.,"Her very cheek against my crowned lip,"
774,BOOK I.,"And, at that moment, felt my body dip"
775,BOOK I.,"Into a warmer air: a moment more,"
776,BOOK I.,Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store
777,BOOK I.,Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes
778,BOOK I.,"A scent of violets, and blossoming limes,"
779,BOOK I.,"Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells,"
780,BOOK I.,Made delicate from all white-flower bells;
781,BOOK I.,"And once, above the edges of our nest,                        670"
782,BOOK I.,"An arch face peep'd,--an Oread as I guess'd."
783,BOOK I.,
784,BOOK I.,"""Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me"
785,BOOK I.,"In midst of all this heaven? Why not see,"
786,BOOK I.,"Far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,"
787,BOOK I.,"And stare them from me? But no, like a spark"
788,BOOK I.,"That needs must die, although its little beam"
789,BOOK I.,"Reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream"
790,BOOK I.,Fell into nothing--into stupid sleep.
791,BOOK I.,"And so it was, until a gentle creep,"
792,BOOK I.,"A careful moving caught my waking ears,                       680"
793,BOOK I.,"And up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,"
794,BOOK I.,My clenched hands;--for lo! the poppies hung
795,BOOK I.,"Dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung"
796,BOOK I.,"A heavy ditty, and the sullen day"
797,BOOK I.,"Had chidden herald Hesperus away,"
798,BOOK I.,With leaden looks: the solitary breeze
799,BOOK I.,"Bluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze"
800,BOOK I.,"With wayward melancholy; and I thought,"
801,BOOK I.,"Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought"
802,BOOK I.,"Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!--            690"
803,BOOK I.,Away I wander'd--all the pleasant hues
804,BOOK I.,Of heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades
805,BOOK I.,Were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades
806,BOOK I.,Were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills
807,BOOK I.,"Seem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills"
808,BOOK I.,Of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown
809,BOOK I.,"In frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown"
810,BOOK I.,Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird
811,BOOK I.,"Before my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd"
812,BOOK I.,"In little journeys, I beheld in it                            700"
813,BOOK I.,"A disguis'd demon, missioned to knit"
814,BOOK I.,My soul with under darkness; to entice
815,BOOK I.,My stumblings down some monstrous precipice:
816,BOOK I.,"Therefore I eager followed, and did curse"
817,BOOK I.,"The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,"
818,BOOK I.,"Rock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!"
819,BOOK I.,"These things, with all their comfortings, are given"
820,BOOK I.,"To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,"
821,BOOK I.,"Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea"
822,BOOK I.,"Of weary life.""                                               710"
823,BOOK I.,
824,BOOK I.,"Thus ended he, and both"
825,BOOK I.,Sat silent: for the maid was very loth
826,BOOK I.,To answer; feeling well that breathed words
827,BOOK I.,"Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords"
828,BOOK I.,"Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps"
829,BOOK I.,"Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,"
830,BOOK I.,And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;
831,BOOK I.,"To put on such a look as would say, _Shame"
832,BOOK I.,"On this poor weakness!_ but, for all her strife,"
833,BOOK I.,She could as soon have crush'd away the life                  720
834,BOOK I.,"From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,"
835,BOOK I.,"She said with trembling chance: ""Is this the cause?"
836,BOOK I.,"This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!"
837,BOOK I.,That one who through this middle earth should pass
838,BOOK I.,"Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave"
839,BOOK I.,"His name upon the harp-string, should achieve"
840,BOOK I.,"No higher bard than simple maidenhood,"
841,BOOK I.,"Singing alone, and fearfully,--how the blood"
842,BOOK I.,Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray
843,BOOK I.,"He knew not where; and how he would say, _nay_,               730"
844,BOOK I.,If any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;
845,BOOK I.,What could it be but love? How a ring-dove
846,BOOK I.,Let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;
847,BOOK I.,"And how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,"
848,BOOK I.,"The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;"
849,BOOK I.,And then the ballad of his sad life closes
850,BOOK I.,"With sighs, and an alas!--Endymion!"
851,BOOK I.,"Be rather in the trumpet's mouth,--anon"
852,BOOK I.,Among the winds at large--that all may hearken!
853,BOOK I.,"Although, before the crystal heavens darken,                  740"
854,BOOK I.,I watch and dote upon the silver lakes
855,BOOK I.,"Pictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes"
856,BOOK I.,"The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,"
857,BOOK I.,"Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands"
858,BOOK I.,"With horses prancing o'er them, palaces"
859,BOOK I.,"And towers of amethyst,--would I so tease"
860,BOOK I.,"My pleasant days, because I could not mount"
861,BOOK I.,Into those regions? The Morphean fount
862,BOOK I.,"Of that fine element that visions, dreams,"
863,BOOK I.,"And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams                750"
864,BOOK I.,"Into its airy channels with so subtle,"
865,BOOK I.,"So thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,"
866,BOOK I.,Circled a million times within the space
867,BOOK I.,"Of a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,"
868,BOOK I.,A tinting of its quality: how light
869,BOOK I.,Must dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight
870,BOOK I.,Than the mere nothing that engenders them!
871,BOOK I.,Then wherefore sully the entrusted gem
872,BOOK I.,Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?
873,BOOK I.,Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick                   760
874,BOOK I.,"For nothing but a dream?"" Hereat the youth"
875,BOOK I.,Look'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth
876,BOOK I.,"Was in his plaited brow: yet, his eyelids"
877,BOOK I.,"Widened a little, as when Zephyr bids"
878,BOOK I.,A little breeze to creep between the fans
879,BOOK I.,Of careless butterflies: amid his pains
880,BOOK I.,"He seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,"
881,BOOK I.,Full palatable; and a colour grew
882,BOOK I.,"Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake."
883,BOOK I.,
884,BOOK I.,"""Peona! ever have I long'd to slake                         770"
885,BOOK I.,"My thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,"
886,BOOK I.,"No merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace"
887,BOOK I.,The stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd--
888,BOOK I.,Though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd
889,BOOK I.,And sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope
890,BOOK I.,"Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,"
891,BOOK I.,To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.
892,BOOK I.,Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks
893,BOOK I.,"Our ready minds to fellowship divine,"
894,BOOK I.,"A fellowship with essence; till we shine,                     780"
895,BOOK I.,"Full alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold"
896,BOOK I.,The clear religion of heaven! Fold
897,BOOK I.,"A rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,"
898,BOOK I.,"And soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress"
899,BOOK I.,"Of music's kiss impregnates the free winds,"
900,BOOK I.,And with a sympathetic touch unbinds
901,BOOK I.,Eolian magic from their lucid wombs:
902,BOOK I.,Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;
903,BOOK I.,Old ditties sigh above their father's grave;
904,BOOK I.,Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave                         790
905,BOOK I.,Round every spot were trod Apollo's foot;
906,BOOK I.,"Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,"
907,BOOK I.,Where long ago a giant battle was;
908,BOOK I.,"And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass"
909,BOOK I.,In every place where infant Orpheus slept.
910,BOOK I.,Feel we these things?--that moment have we stept
911,BOOK I.,"Into a sort of oneness, and our state"
912,BOOK I.,Is like a floating spirit's. But there are
913,BOOK I.,"Richer entanglements, enthralments far"
914,BOOK I.,"More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,                    800"
915,BOOK I.,To the chief intensity: the crown of these
916,BOOK I.,"Is made of love and friendship, and sits high"
917,BOOK I.,Upon the forehead of humanity.
918,BOOK I.,All its more ponderous and bulky worth
919,BOOK I.,"Is friendship, whence there ever issues forth"
920,BOOK I.,"A steady splendour; but at the tip-top,"
921,BOOK I.,"There hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop"
922,BOOK I.,"Of light, and that is love: its influence,"
923,BOOK I.,"Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,"
924,BOOK I.,"At which we start and fret; till in the end,                  810"
925,BOOK I.,"Melting into its radiance, we blend,"
926,BOOK I.,"Mingle, and so become a part of it,--"
927,BOOK I.,Nor with aught else can our souls interknit
928,BOOK I.,"So wingedly: when we combine therewith,"
929,BOOK I.,"Life's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,"
930,BOOK I.,And we are nurtured like a pelican brood.
931,BOOK I.,"Aye, so delicious is the unsating food,"
932,BOOK I.,"That men, who might have tower'd in the van"
933,BOOK I.,"Of all the congregated world, to fan"
934,BOOK I.,And winnow from the coming step of time                       820

938,BOOK I.,Whilst they did sleep in love's elysium.
939,BOOK I.,"And, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,"
940,BOOK I.,Than speak against this ardent listlessness:
941,BOOK I.,For I have ever thought that it might bless
942,BOOK I.,The world with benefits unknowingly;
943,BOOK I.,"As does the nightingale, upperched high,"
944,BOOK I.,And cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves--                830
945,BOOK I.,"She sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives"
946,BOOK I.,How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.
947,BOOK I.,"Just so may love, although 'tis understood"
948,BOOK I.,"The mere commingling of passionate breath,"
949,BOOK I.,Produce more than our searching witnesseth:
950,BOOK I.,"What I know not: but who, of men, can tell"
951,BOOK I.,"That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell"
952,BOOK I.,"To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,"
953,BOOK I.,"The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,"
954,BOOK I.,"The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,                   840"
955,BOOK I.,"The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,"
956,BOOK I.,"Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,"

967,BOOK I.,And never can be born of atomies
968,BOOK I.,"That buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,"
969,BOOK I.,"Leaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,"
970,BOOK I.,My restless spirit never could endure
971,BOOK I.,"To brood so long upon one luxury,"
972,BOOK I.,"Unless it did, though fearfully, espy"
973,BOOK I.,A hope beyond the shadow of a dream.
974,BOOK I.,"My sayings will the less obscured seem,"
975,BOOK I.,When I have told thee how my waking sight                     860
976,BOOK I.,Has made me scruple whether that same night
977,BOOK I.,"Was pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!"
978,BOOK I.,"Beyond the matron-temple of Latona,"
979,BOOK I.,"Which we should see but for these darkening boughs,"
980,BOOK I.,"Lies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows"
981,BOOK I.,"Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart,"
982,BOOK I.,"And meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,"
983,BOOK I.,"And spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide"
984,BOOK I.,"Past them, but he must brush on every side."
985,BOOK I.,"Some moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,                870"
986,BOOK I.,"Far as the slabbed margin of a well,"

992,BOOK I.,"'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits"
993,BOOK I.,"In a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,"
994,BOOK I.,When all above was faint with mid-day heat.
995,BOOK I.,"And there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,              880"
996,BOOK I.,I'd bubble up the water through a reed;
997,BOOK I.,So reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships
998,BOOK I.,"Of moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,"
999,BOOK I.,With leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be
1000,BOOK I.,"Of their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,"
1001,BOOK I.,"When love-lorn hours had left me less a child,"
1002,BOOK I.,I sat contemplating the figures wild
1003,BOOK I.,Of o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.
1004,BOOK I.,"Upon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew"
1005,BOOK I.,"A cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;                      890"
1006,BOOK I.,"So plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver"
1007,BOOK I.,"The happy chance: so happy, I was fain"

1009,BOOK I.,"And, therefore, was just going; when, behold!"
1010,BOOK I.,"A wonder, fair as any I have told--"
1011,BOOK I.,"The same bright face I tasted in my sleep,"
1012,BOOK I.,Smiling in the clear well. My heart did leap
1013,BOOK I.,Through the cool depth.--It moved as if to flee--
1014,BOOK I.,"I started up, when lo! refreshfully,"
1015,BOOK I.,"There came upon my face, in plenteous showers,                900"
1016,BOOK I.,"Dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,"
1017,BOOK I.,"Wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,"
1018,BOOK I.,Bathing my spirit in a new delight.
1019,BOOK I.,"Aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss"
1020,BOOK I.,Alone preserved me from the drear abyss
1021,BOOK I.,"Of death, for the fair form had gone again."
1022,BOOK I.,Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain

1028,BOOK I.,By a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!
1029,BOOK I.,"Like sorrow came upon me, heavier still,"
1030,BOOK I.,Than when I wander'd from the poppy hill:
1031,BOOK I.,And a whole age of lingering moments crept
1032,BOOK I.,"Sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept"
1033,BOOK I.,Away at once the deadly yellow spleen.
1034,BOOK I.,"Yes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;"
1035,BOOK I.,Once more been tortured with renewed life.                    920

1037,BOOK I.,"With the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies"
1038,BOOK I.,"Warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes"
1039,BOOK I.,"In pity of the shatter'd infant buds,--"
1040,BOOK I.,"That time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,"

1044,BOOK I.,"Straying about, yet, coop'd up in the den"
1045,BOOK I.,"Of helpless discontent,--hurling my lance                     930"
1046,BOOK I.,"From place to place, and following at chance,"
1047,BOOK I.,"At last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,"
1048,BOOK I.,"And, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck"
1049,BOOK I.,"In the middle of a brook,--whose silver ramble"
1050,BOOK I.,"Down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,"
1051,BOOK I.,"Tracing along, it brought me to a cave,"

1062,BOOK I.,"She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:"
1063,BOOK I.,"Or 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,"
1064,BOOK I.,"And babbles thorough silence, till her wits"

1066,BOOK I.,"Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone"
1067,BOOK I.,"Of sadness. O that she would take my vows,"
1068,BOOK I.,"And breathe them sighingly among the boughs,"
1069,BOOK I.,"To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,"
1070,BOOK I.,"Daily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,"

1090,BOOK I.,"Bear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;"

1121,BOOK II.,"And shadowy, through the mist of passed years:"
1122,BOOK II.,"For others, good or bad, hatred and tears"
1123,BOOK II.,"Have become indolent; but touching thine,"
1124,BOOK II.,"One sigh doth echo, one poor sob doth pine,"
1125,BOOK II.,One kiss brings honey-dew from buried days.
1126,BOOK II.,"The woes of Troy, towers smothering o'er their blaze,"
1127,BOOK II.,"Stiff-holden shields, far-piercing spears, keen blades,"
1128,BOOK II.,"Struggling, and blood, and shrieks--all dimly fades            10"
1129,BOOK II.,Into some backward corner of the brain;
1130,BOOK II.,"Yet, in our very souls, we feel amain"
1131,BOOK II.,The close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.
1132,BOOK II.,"Hence, pageant history! hence, gilded cheat!"
1133,BOOK II.,Swart planet in the universe of deeds!
1134,BOOK II.,"Wide sea, that one continuous murmur breeds"
1135,BOOK II.,Along the pebbled shore of memory!
1136,BOOK II.,Many old rotten-timber'd boats there be
1137,BOOK II.,"Upon thy vaporous bosom, magnified"
1138,BOOK II.,"To goodly vessels; many a sail of pride,                       20"
1139,BOOK II.,"And golden keel'd, is left unlaunch'd and dry."
1140,BOOK II.,"But wherefore this? What care, though owl did fly"
1141,BOOK II.,About the great Athenian admiral's mast?
1142,BOOK II.,"What care, though striding Alexander past"
1143,BOOK II.,The Indus with his Macedonian numbers?
1144,BOOK II.,Though old Ulysses tortured from his slumbers
1145,BOOK II.,"The glutted Cyclops, what care?--Juliet leaning"
1146,BOOK II.,"Amid her window-flowers,--sighing,--weaning"
1147,BOOK II.,"Tenderly her fancy from its maiden snow,"
1148,BOOK II.,Doth more avail than these: the silver flow                    30
1149,BOOK II.,"Of Hero's tears, the swoon of Imogen,"
1150,BOOK II.,"Fair Pastorella in the bandit's den,"
1151,BOOK II.,Are things to brood on with more ardency
1152,BOOK II.,Than the death-day of empires. Fearfully
1153,BOOK II.,"Must such conviction come upon his head,"
1154,BOOK II.,"Who, thus far, discontent, has dared to tread,"
1155,BOOK II.,"Without one muse's smile, or kind behest,"
1156,BOOK II.,"The path of love and poesy. But rest,"
1157,BOOK II.,"In chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear"
1158,BOOK II.,"Than to be crush'd, in striving to uprear                      40"
1159,BOOK II.,Love's standard on the battlements of song.
1160,BOOK II.,"So once more days and nights aid me along,"
1161,BOOK II.,Like legion'd soldiers.
1162,BOOK II.,
1163,BOOK II.,"Brain-sick shepherd prince,"
1164,BOOK II.,What promise hast thou faithful guarded since
1165,BOOK II.,"The day of sacrifice? Or, have new sorrows"
1166,BOOK II.,Come with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?
1167,BOOK II.,"Alas! 'tis his old grief. For many days,"
1168,BOOK II.,Has he been wandering in uncertain ways:
1169,BOOK II.,"Through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;                  50"
1170,BOOK II.,"Counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes"
1171,BOOK II.,"Of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,"
1172,BOOK II.,"Hour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill."
1173,BOOK II.,"Now he is sitting by a shady spring,"
1174,BOOK II.,And elbow-deep with feverous fingering
1175,BOOK II.,Stems the upbursting cold: a wild rose tree
1176,BOOK II.,"Pavilions him in bloom, and he doth see"
1177,BOOK II.,A bud which snares his fancy: lo! but now
1178,BOOK II.,"He plucks it, dips its stalk in the water: how!"
1179,BOOK II.,"It swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;              60"
1180,BOOK II.,"And, in the middle, there is softly pight"
1181,BOOK II.,A golden butterfly; upon whose wings
1182,BOOK II.,"There must be surely character'd strange things,"
1183,BOOK II.,"For with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft."
1184,BOOK II.,
1185,BOOK II.,"Lightly this little herald flew aloft,"
1186,BOOK II.,Follow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands:
1187,BOOK II.,Onward it flies. From languor's sullen bands
1188,BOOK II.,"His limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies"
1189,BOOK II.,Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.
1190,BOOK II.,"It seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;                        70"
1191,BOOK II.,And like a new-born spirit did he pass
1192,BOOK II.,"Through the green evening quiet in the sun,"
1193,BOOK II.,"O'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,"
1194,BOOK II.,"Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams"
1195,BOOK II.,The summer time away. One track unseams
1196,BOOK II.,"A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue"
1197,BOOK II.,"Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,"
1198,BOOK II.,"He sinks adown a solitary glen,"
1199,BOOK II.,"Where there was never sound of mortal men,"
1200,BOOK II.,"Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences                      80"
1201,BOOK II.,"Melting to silence, when upon the breeze"
1202,BOOK II.,"Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,"
1203,BOOK II.,To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet
1204,BOOK II.,"Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,"
1205,BOOK II.,Until it reached a splashing fountain's side
1206,BOOK II.,"That, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd"
1207,BOOK II.,"Unto the temperate air: then high it soar'd,"
1208,BOOK II.,"And, downward, suddenly began to dip,"
1209,BOOK II.,"As if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip"
1210,BOOK II.,"The crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch                  90"
1211,BOOK II.,"Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch"
1212,BOOK II.,Even with mealy gold the waters clear.
1213,BOOK II.,"But, at that very touch, to disappear"
1214,BOOK II.,"So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,"
1215,BOOK II.,"Endymion sought around, and shook each bed"
1216,BOOK II.,Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung
1217,BOOK II.,"Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,"
1218,BOOK II.,What whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?
1219,BOOK II.,It was a nymph uprisen to the breast
1220,BOOK II.,"In the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood                100"
1221,BOOK II.,"'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood."
1222,BOOK II.,"To him her dripping hand she softly kist,"
1223,BOOK II.,And anxiously began to plait and twist
1224,BOOK II.,"Her ringlets round her fingers, saying: ""Youth!"
1225,BOOK II.,"Too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,"
1226,BOOK II.,"The bitterness of love: too long indeed,"
1227,BOOK II.,Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed
1228,BOOK II.,"Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer"
1229,BOOK II.,All the bright riches of my crystal coffer
1230,BOOK II.,"To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,                        110"
1231,BOOK II.,"Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,"
1232,BOOK II.,"Vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;"
1233,BOOK II.,"Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws"
1234,BOOK II.,A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands
1235,BOOK II.,"Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands"
1236,BOOK II.,"By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,"
1237,BOOK II.,"My charming rod, my potent river spells;"
1238,BOOK II.,"Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup"
1239,BOOK II.,"Meander gave me,--for I bubbled up"
1240,BOOK II.,To fainting creatures in a desert wild.                       120
1241,BOOK II.,"But woe is me, I am but as a child"
1242,BOOK II.,"To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,"
1243,BOOK II.,"Is, that I pity thee; that on this day"
1244,BOOK II.,I've been thy guide; that thou must wander far
1245,BOOK II.,"In other regions, past the scanty bar"
1246,BOOK II.,"To mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en"
1247,BOOK II.,"From every wasting sigh, from every pain,"
1248,BOOK II.,Into the gentle bosom of thy love.
1249,BOOK II.,"Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above:"
1250,BOOK II.,"But, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!                      130"
1251,BOOK II.,"I have a ditty for my hollow cell."""
1252,BOOK II.,
1253,BOOK II.,"Hereat, she vanished from Endymion's gaze,"
1254,BOOK II.,Who brooded o'er the water in amaze:
1255,BOOK II.,"The dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool"
1256,BOOK II.,"Lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,"
1257,BOOK II.,"Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,"
1258,BOOK II.,"And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill"
1259,BOOK II.,"Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,"
1260,BOOK II.,"Holding his forehead, to keep off the burr"
1261,BOOK II.,"Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;                    140"
1262,BOOK II.,"And, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown"
1263,BOOK II.,"Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,"
1264,BOOK II.,"Thus breath'd he to himself: ""Whoso encamps"
1265,BOOK II.,"To take a fancied city of delight,"
1266,BOOK II.,"O what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,"
1267,BOOK II.,"After long toil and travelling, to miss"
1268,BOOK II.,"The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:"
1269,BOOK II.,"Yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;"
1270,BOOK II.,"Another city doth he set about,"
1271,BOOK II.,Free from the smallest pebble-head of doubt                   150
1272,BOOK II.,That he will seize on trickling honey-combs:
1273,BOOK II.,"Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,"
1274,BOOK II.,And onward to another city speeds.
1275,BOOK II.,"But this is human life: the war, the deeds,"
1276,BOOK II.,"The disappointment, the anxiety,"
1277,BOOK II.,"Imagination's struggles, far and nigh,"
1278,BOOK II.,"All human; bearing in themselves this good,"
1279,BOOK II.,"That they are still the air, the subtle food,"
1280,BOOK II.,"To make us feel existence, and to shew"
1281,BOOK II.,"How quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,                   160"
1282,BOOK II.,"Whether to weeds or flowers; but for me,"
1283,BOOK II.,There is no depth to strike in: I can see
1284,BOOK II.,Nought earthly worth my compassing; so stand
1285,BOOK II.,"Upon a misty, jutting head of land--"
1286,BOOK II.,"Alone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,"
1287,BOOK II.,When mad Eurydice is listening to't;
1288,BOOK II.,"I'd rather stand upon this misty peak,"
1289,BOOK II.,"With not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,"
1290,BOOK II.,"But the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,"
1291,BOOK II.,Than be--I care not what. O meekest dove                      170
1292,BOOK II.,"Of heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!"
1293,BOOK II.,"From thy blue throne, now filling all the air,"
1294,BOOK II.,Glance but one little beam of temper'd light
1295,BOOK II.,"Into my bosom, that the dreadful might"
1296,BOOK II.,And tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!
1297,BOOK II.,"Yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,"
1298,BOOK II.,"Would give a pang to jealous misery,"
1299,BOOK II.,Worse than the torment's self: but rather tie
1300,BOOK II.,"Large wings upon my shoulders, and point out"
1301,BOOK II.,My love's far dwelling. Though the playful rout               180
1302,BOOK II.,"Of Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,"
1303,BOOK II.,"Too keen in beauty, for thy silver prow"
1304,BOOK II.,Not to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream.
1305,BOOK II.,"O be propitious, nor severely deem"
1306,BOOK II.,"My madness impious; for, by all the stars"
1307,BOOK II.,"That tend thy bidding, I do think the bars"
1308,BOOK II.,That kept my spirit in are burst--that I
1309,BOOK II.,Am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!
1310,BOOK II.,How beautiful thou art! The world how deep!
1311,BOOK II.,How tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep                     190
1312,BOOK II.,"Around their axle! Then these gleaming reins,"
1313,BOOK II.,How lithe! When this thy chariot attains
1314,BOOK II.,"Its airy goal, haply some bower veils"
1315,BOOK II.,Those twilight eyes?--Those eyes!--my spirit fails--
1316,BOOK II.,"Dear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air"
1317,BOOK II.,"Will gulph me--help!""--At this with madden'd stare,"
1318,BOOK II.,"And lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;"
1319,BOOK II.,"Like old Deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,"
1320,BOOK II.,Or blind Orion hungry for the morn.
1321,BOOK II.,"And, but from the deep cavern there was borne                 200"
1322,BOOK II.,"A voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;"
1323,BOOK II.,"Nor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan"
1324,BOOK II.,"Had more been heard. Thus swell'd it forth: ""Descend,"
1325,BOOK II.,Young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend
1326,BOOK II.,Into the sparry hollows of the world!
1327,BOOK II.,Oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd
1328,BOOK II.,As from thy threshold; day by day hast been
1329,BOOK II.,A little lower than the chilly sheen
1330,BOOK II.,"Of icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms"
1331,BOOK II.,Into the deadening ether that still charms                    210
1332,BOOK II.,"Their marble being: now, as deep profound"
1333,BOOK II.,"As those are high, descend! He ne'er is crown'd"
1334,BOOK II.,"With immortality, who fears to follow"
1335,BOOK II.,"Where airy voices lead: so through the hollow,"
1336,BOOK II.,"The silent mysteries of earth, descend!"""
1337,BOOK II.,
1338,BOOK II.,"He heard but the last words, nor could contend"
1339,BOOK II.,One moment in reflection: for he fled
1340,BOOK II.,"Into the fearful deep, to hide his head"
1341,BOOK II.,"From the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness."
1342,BOOK II.,
1343,BOOK II.,"'Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;"
1344,BOOK II.,"Sharpening, by degrees, his appetite                          221"
1345,BOOK II.,"To dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,"
1346,BOOK II.,"The region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,"
1347,BOOK II.,But mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;
1348,BOOK II.,A dusky empire and its diadems;
1349,BOOK II.,One faint eternal eventide of gems.
1350,BOOK II.,"Aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,"
1351,BOOK II.,"Along whose track the prince quick footsteps told,"
1352,BOOK II.,With all its lines abrupt and angular:
1353,BOOK II.,"Out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,                   230"
1354,BOOK II.,"Through a vast antre; then the metal woof,"
1355,BOOK II.,"Like Vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof"
1356,BOOK II.,"Curves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,"
1357,BOOK II.,"It seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss"
1358,BOOK II.,Fancy into belief: anon it leads
1359,BOOK II.,"Through winding passages, where sameness breeds"
1360,BOOK II.,Vexing conceptions of some sudden change;
1361,BOOK II.,"Whether to silver grots, or giant range"
1362,BOOK II.,"Of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge"
1363,BOOK II.,Athwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge                        240
1364,BOOK II.,"Now fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath"
1365,BOOK II.,"Towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth"
1366,BOOK II.,"A hundred waterfalls, whose voices come"
1367,BOOK II.,But as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb
1368,BOOK II.,"His bosom grew, when first he, far away,"
1369,BOOK II.,"Descried an orbed diamond, set to fray"
1370,BOOK II.,Old darkness from his throne: 'twas like the sun
1371,BOOK II.,Uprisen o'er chaos: and with such a stun
1372,BOOK II.,"Came the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,"
1373,BOOK II.,He saw not fiercer wonders--past the wit                      250
1374,BOOK II.,"Of any spirit to tell, but one of those"
1375,BOOK II.,"Who, when this planet's sphering time doth close,"
1376,BOOK II.,Will be its high remembrancers: who they?
1377,BOOK II.,The mighty ones who have made eternal day
1378,BOOK II.,For Greece and England. While astonishment
1379,BOOK II.,"With deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went"
1380,BOOK II.,"Into a marble gallery, passing through"
1381,BOOK II.,"A mimic temple, so complete and true"
1382,BOOK II.,"In sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd"
1383,BOOK II.,"To search it inwards; whence far off appear'd,                260"
1384,BOOK II.,"Through a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,"
1385,BOOK II.,"And, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,"
1386,BOOK II.,"A quiver'd Dian. Stepping awfully,"
1387,BOOK II.,The youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye
1388,BOOK II.,"Down sidelong aisles, and into niches old."
1389,BOOK II.,"And when, more near against the marble cold"
1390,BOOK II.,"He had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread"
1391,BOOK II.,"All courts and passages, where silence dead"
1392,BOOK II.,Rous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:
1393,BOOK II.,"And long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint                 270"
1394,BOOK II.,"Himself with every mystery, and awe;"
1395,BOOK II.,"Till, weary, he sat down before the maw"
1396,BOOK II.,"Of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim"
1397,BOOK II.,To wild uncertainty and shadows grim.
1398,BOOK II.,"There, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,"
1399,BOOK II.,"And thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore"
1400,BOOK II.,The journey homeward to habitual self!
1401,BOOK II.,"A mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,"
1402,BOOK II.,"Whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,"
1403,BOOK II.,"Cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,                          280"
1404,BOOK II.,Into the bosom of a hated thing.
1405,BOOK II.,
1406,BOOK II.,What misery most drowningly doth sing
1407,BOOK II.,"In lone Endymion's ear, now he has caught"
1408,BOOK II.,"The goal of consciousness? Ah, 'tis the thought,"
1409,BOOK II.,The deadly feel of solitude: for lo!
1410,BOOK II.,"He cannot see the heavens, nor the flow"
1411,BOOK II.,"Of rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild"
1412,BOOK II.,"In pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,"
1413,BOOK II.,"The cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,"
1414,BOOK II.,"Like herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest                    290"
1415,BOOK II.,"Cool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;"
1416,BOOK II.,But far from such companionship to wear
1417,BOOK II.,"An unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,"
1418,BOOK II.,"Was now his lot. And must he patient stay,"
1419,BOOK II.,Tracing fantastic figures with his spear?
1420,BOOK II.,"""No!"" exclaimed he, ""why should I tarry here?"""
1421,BOOK II.,No! loudly echoed times innumerable.
1422,BOOK II.,"At which he straightway started, and 'gan tell"
1423,BOOK II.,His paces back into the temple's chief;
1424,BOOK II.,Warming and growing strong in the belief                      300
1425,BOOK II.,Of help from Dian: so that when again
1426,BOOK II.,"He caught her airy form, thus did he plain,"
1427,BOOK II.,"Moving more near the while. ""O Haunter chaste"
1428,BOOK II.,"Of river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,"
1429,BOOK II.,Where with thy silver bow and arrows keen
1430,BOOK II.,"Art thou now forested? O woodland Queen,"
1431,BOOK II.,What smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?
1432,BOOK II.,Where dost thou listen to the wide halloos
1433,BOOK II.,Of thy disparted nymphs? Through what dark tree
1434,BOOK II.,"Glimmers thy crescent? Wheresoe'er it be,                     310"
1435,BOOK II.,'Tis in the breath of heaven: thou dost taste
1436,BOOK II.,"Freedom as none can taste it, nor dost waste"
1437,BOOK II.,Thy loveliness in dismal elements;
1438,BOOK II.,"But, finding in our green earth sweet contents,"
1439,BOOK II.,"There livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee"
1440,BOOK II.,"It feels Elysian, how rich to me,"
1441,BOOK II.,"An exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!"
1442,BOOK II.,Within my breast there lives a choking flame--
1443,BOOK II.,O let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!
1444,BOOK II.,A homeward fever parches up my tongue--                       320
1445,BOOK II.,O let me slake it at the running springs!
1446,BOOK II.,Upon my car a noisy nothing rings--
1447,BOOK II.,O let me once more hear the linnet's note!
1448,BOOK II.,Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float--
1449,BOOK II.,O let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!
1450,BOOK II.,Dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?
1451,BOOK II.,O think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!
1452,BOOK II.,Dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?
1453,BOOK II.,O think how this dry palate would rejoice!
1454,BOOK II.,"If in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,                   330"
1455,BOOK II.,O think how I should love a bed of flowers!--
1456,BOOK II.,Young goddess! let me see my native bowers!
1457,BOOK II.,"Deliver me from this rapacious deep!"""
1458,BOOK II.,
1459,BOOK II.,"Thus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap"
1460,BOOK II.,"His destiny, alert he stood: but when"
1461,BOOK II.,"Obstinate silence came heavily again,"
1462,BOOK II.,Feeling about for its old couch of space
1463,BOOK II.,"And airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face"
1464,BOOK II.,"Desponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill."
1465,BOOK II.,"But 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill                340"
1466,BOOK II.,"To its old channel, or a swollen tide"
1467,BOOK II.,"To margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,"
1468,BOOK II.,"And flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns"
1469,BOOK II.,Up heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns
1470,BOOK II.,"Itself, and strives its own delights to hide--"
1471,BOOK II.,Nor in one spot alone; the floral pride
1472,BOOK II.,In a long whispering birth enchanted grew
1473,BOOK II.,Before his footsteps; as when heav'd anew
1474,BOOK II.,"Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,"
1475,BOOK II.,"Down whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,"
1476,BOOK II.,"Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.                     351"
1477,BOOK II.,
1478,BOOK II.,"Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,"
1479,BOOK II.,Upon his fairy journey on he hastes;
1480,BOOK II.,"So anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes"
1481,BOOK II.,One moment with his hand among the sweets:
1482,BOOK II.,Onward he goes--he stops--his bosom beats
1483,BOOK II.,"As plainly in his ear, as the faint charm"
1484,BOOK II.,"Of which the throbs were born. This still alarm,"
1485,BOOK II.,"This sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe:"
1486,BOOK II.,For it came more softly than the east could blow              360
1487,BOOK II.,Arion's magic to the Atlantic isles;
1488,BOOK II.,"Or than the west, made jealous by the smiles"
1489,BOOK II.,"Of thron'd Apollo, could breathe back the lyre"
1490,BOOK II.,To seas Ionian and Tyrian.
1491,BOOK II.,
1492,BOOK II.,"O did he ever live, that lonely man,"
1493,BOOK II.,Who lov'd--and music slew not? 'Tis the pest
1494,BOOK II.,"Of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;"
1495,BOOK II.,That things of delicate and tenderest worth
1496,BOOK II.,"Are swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,"
1497,BOOK II.,By one consuming flame: it doth immerse                       370
1498,BOOK II.,And suffocate true blessings in a curse.
1499,BOOK II.,"Half-happy, by comparison of bliss,"
1500,BOOK II.,Is miserable. 'Twas even so with this
1501,BOOK II.,"Dew-dropping melody, in the Carian's ear;"
1502,BOOK II.,"First heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,"
1503,BOOK II.,Vanish'd in elemental passion.
1504,BOOK II.,
1505,BOOK II.,"And down some swart abysm he had gone,"
1506,BOOK II.,Had not a heavenly guide benignant led
1507,BOOK II.,"To where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head"
1508,BOOK II.,"Brushing, awakened: then the sounds again                     380"
1509,BOOK II.,Went noiseless as a passing noontide rain
1510,BOOK II.,"Over a bower, where little space he stood;"
1511,BOOK II.,For as the sunset peeps into a wood
1512,BOOK II.,"So saw he panting light, and towards it went"
1513,BOOK II.,"Through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!"
1514,BOOK II.,"Upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,"
1515,BOOK II.,Cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.
1516,BOOK II.,
1517,BOOK II.,"After a thousand mazes overgone,"
1518,BOOK II.,"At last, with sudden step, he came upon"
1519,BOOK II.,"A chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,                     390"
1520,BOOK II.,"Full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,"
1521,BOOK II.,And more of beautiful and strange beside:
1522,BOOK II.,"For on a silken couch of rosy pride,"
1523,BOOK II.,"In midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth"
1524,BOOK II.,"Of fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,"
1525,BOOK II.,"Than sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:"
1526,BOOK II.,"And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,"
1527,BOOK II.,"Or ripe October's faded marigolds,"
1528,BOOK II.,Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds--
1529,BOOK II.,Not hiding up an Apollonian curve                             400
1530,BOOK II.,"Of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve"
1531,BOOK II.,"Of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;"
1532,BOOK II.,"But rather, giving them to the filled sight"
1533,BOOK II.,Officiously. Sideway his face repos'd
1534,BOOK II.,"On one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,"
1535,BOOK II.,"By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth"
1536,BOOK II.,To slumbery pout; just as the morning south
1537,BOOK II.,"Disparts a dew-lipp'd rose. Above his head,"
1538,BOOK II.,Four lily stalks did their white honours wed
1539,BOOK II.,To make a coronal; and round him grew                         410
1540,BOOK II.,"All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,"
1541,BOOK II.,Together intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh:
1542,BOOK II.,"The vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,"
1543,BOOK II.,"Shading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,"
1544,BOOK II.,Of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;
1545,BOOK II.,Convolvulus in streaked vases flush;
1546,BOOK II.,"The creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;"
1547,BOOK II.,"And virgin's bower, trailing airily;"
1548,BOOK II.,"With others of the sisterhood. Hard by,"
1549,BOOK II.,Stood serene Cupids watching silently.                        420
1550,BOOK II.,"One, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,"
1551,BOOK II.,Muffling to death the pathos with his wings;
1552,BOOK II.,"And, ever and anon, uprose to look"
1553,BOOK II.,At the youth's slumber; while another took
1554,BOOK II.,"A willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,"
1555,BOOK II.,And shook it on his hair; another flew
1556,BOOK II.,"In through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise"
1557,BOOK II.,Rain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes.
1558,BOOK II.,
1559,BOOK II.,"At these enchantments, and yet many more,"
1560,BOOK II.,The breathless Latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;                430
1561,BOOK II.,"Until, impatient in embarrassment,"
1562,BOOK II.,"He forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went"
1563,BOOK II.,"To that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,"
1564,BOOK II.,"Smiling, thus whisper'd: ""Though from upper day"
1565,BOOK II.,"Thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here"
1566,BOOK II.,"Might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!"
1567,BOOK II.,"For 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,"
1568,BOOK II.,When some ethereal and high-favouring donor
1569,BOOK II.,Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;
1570,BOOK II.,"As now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence                     440"
1571,BOOK II.,Was I in no wise startled. So recline
1572,BOOK II.,"Upon these living flowers. Here is wine,"
1573,BOOK II.,"Alive with sparkles--never, I aver,"
1574,BOOK II.,"Since Ariadne was a vintager,"
1575,BOOK II.,"So cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,"
1576,BOOK II.,"Sent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears"
1577,BOOK II.,"Were high about Pomona: here is cream,"
1578,BOOK II.,Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;
1579,BOOK II.,Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd
1580,BOOK II.,"For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd                       450"
1581,BOOK II.,"By any touch, a bunch of blooming plums"
1582,BOOK II.,Ready to melt between an infant's gums:
1583,BOOK II.,"And here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees,"
1584,BOOK II.,"In starlight, by the three Hesperides."
1585,BOOK II.,"Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know"
1586,BOOK II.,"Of all these things around us."" He did so,"
1587,BOOK II.,Still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;
1588,BOOK II.,"And thus: ""I need not any hearing tire"
1589,BOOK II.,By telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd
1590,BOOK II.,"For a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind                460"
1591,BOOK II.,Him all in all unto her doting self.
1592,BOOK II.,"Who would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,"
1593,BOOK II.,He was content to let her amorous plea
1594,BOOK II.,Faint through his careless arms; content to see
1595,BOOK II.,An unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;
1596,BOOK II.,"Content, O fool! to make a cold retreat,"
1597,BOOK II.,"When on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,"
1598,BOOK II.,Lay sorrowing; when every tear was born
1599,BOOK II.,Of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes
1600,BOOK II.,"Were clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs               470"
1601,BOOK II.,Came vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small.
1602,BOOK II.,"Hush! no exclaim--yet, justly mightst thou call"
1603,BOOK II.,"Curses upon his head.--I was half glad,"
1604,BOOK II.,"But my poor mistress went distract and mad,"
1605,BOOK II.,When the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew
1606,BOOK II.,"To Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew"
1607,BOOK II.,Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;
1608,BOOK II.,"Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd"
1609,BOOK II.,"Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he,"
1610,BOOK II.,"That same Adonis, safe in the privacy                         480"
1611,BOOK II.,Of this still region all his winter-sleep.
1612,BOOK II.,"Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep"
1613,BOOK II.,"Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower"
1614,BOOK II.,"Heal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,"
1615,BOOK II.,Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:
1616,BOOK II.,"The which she fills with visions, and doth dress"
1617,BOOK II.,In all this quiet luxury; and hath set
1618,BOOK II.,"Us young immortals, without any let,"
1619,BOOK II.,"To watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd,"
1620,BOOK II.,"Even to a moment's filling up, and fast                       490"
1621,BOOK II.,"She scuds with summer breezes, to pant through"
1622,BOOK II.,"The first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew"
1623,BOOK II.,Embower'd sports in Cytherea's isle.
1624,BOOK II.,Look! how those winged listeners all this while
1625,BOOK II.,"Stand anxious: see! behold!""--This clamant word"
1626,BOOK II.,Broke through the careful silence; for they heard
1627,BOOK II.,"A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd"
1628,BOOK II.,"Pigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd,"
1629,BOOK II.,"The while one hand, that erst upon his thigh"
1630,BOOK II.,"Lay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually                    500"
1631,BOOK II.,Up to his forehead. Then there was a hum
1632,BOOK II.,"Of sudden voices, echoing, ""Come! come!"
1633,BOOK II.,Arise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd
1634,BOOK II.,"Unto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd"
1635,BOOK II.,Full soothingly to every nested finch:
1636,BOOK II.,"Rise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch"
1637,BOOK II.,"To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!"""
1638,BOOK II.,"At this, from every side they hurried in,"
1639,BOOK II.,"Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,"
1640,BOOK II.,And doubling over head their little fists                     510
1641,BOOK II.,In backward yawns. But all were soon alive:
1642,BOOK II.,"For as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive"
1643,BOOK II.,"In nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,"
1644,BOOK II.,So from the arbour roof down swell'd an air
1645,BOOK II.,Odorous and enlivening; making all
1646,BOOK II.,"To laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call"
1647,BOOK II.,For their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green
1648,BOOK II.,"Disparted, and far upward could be seen"
1649,BOOK II.,"Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,"
1650,BOOK II.,"Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,"
1651,BOOK II.,"Spun off a drizzling dew,--which falling chill                521"
1652,BOOK II.,"On soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still"
1653,BOOK II.,Nestle and turn uneasily about.
1654,BOOK II.,"Soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,"
1655,BOOK II.,And silken traces lighten'd in descent;
1656,BOOK II.,"And soon, returning from love's banishment,"
1657,BOOK II.,Queen Venus leaning downward open arm'd:
1658,BOOK II.,"Her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd"
1659,BOOK II.,"A tumult to his heart, and a new life"
1660,BOOK II.,"Into his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,                          530"
1661,BOOK II.,"But for her comforting! unhappy sight,"
1662,BOOK II.,"But meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write"
1663,BOOK II.,Of these first minutes? The unchariest muse
1664,BOOK II.,To embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.
1665,BOOK II.,
1666,BOOK II.,"O it has ruffled every spirit there,"
1667,BOOK II.,"Saving love's self, who stands superb to share"
1668,BOOK II.,The general gladness: awfully he stands;
1669,BOOK II.,A sovereign quell is in his waving hands;
1670,BOOK II.,No sight can bear the lightning of his bow;
1671,BOOK II.,"His quiver is mysterious, none can know                       540"
1672,BOOK II.,What themselves think of it; from forth his eyes
1673,BOOK II.,There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:
1674,BOOK II.,"A scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who"
1675,BOOK II.,Look full upon it feel anon the blue
1676,BOOK II.,Of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.
1677,BOOK II.,"Endymion feels it, and no more controls"
1678,BOOK II.,"The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,"
1679,BOOK II.,He had begun a plaining of his woe.
1680,BOOK II.,"But Venus, bending forward, said: ""My child,"
1681,BOOK II.,Favour this gentle youth; his days are wild                   550
1682,BOOK II.,With love--he--but alas! too well I see
1683,BOOK II.,Thou know'st the deepness of his misery.
1684,BOOK II.,"Ah, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,"
1685,BOOK II.,That when through heavy hours I used to rue
1686,BOOK II.,"The endless sleep of this new-born Adon',"
1687,BOOK II.,This stranger ay I pitied. For upon
1688,BOOK II.,A dreary morning once I fled away
1689,BOOK II.,"Into the breezy clouds, to weep and pray"
1690,BOOK II.,For this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz'd
1691,BOOK II.,"Me even to tears: thence, when a little eas'd,                560"
1692,BOOK II.,"Down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,"
1693,BOOK II.,I saw this youth as he despairing stood:
1694,BOOK II.,Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind;
1695,BOOK II.,Those same full fringed lids a constant blind
1696,BOOK II.,Over his sullen eyes: I saw him throw
1697,BOOK II.,"Himself on wither'd leaves, even as though"
1698,BOOK II.,"Death had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,"
1699,BOOK II.,Yet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd
1700,BOOK II.,"Some fair immortal, and that his embrace"
1701,BOOK II.,Had zoned her through the night. There is no trace            570
1702,BOOK II.,"Of this in heaven: I have mark'd each cheek,"
1703,BOOK II.,And find it is the vainest thing to seek;
1704,BOOK II.,And that of all things 'tis kept secretest.
1705,BOOK II.,Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest:
1706,BOOK II.,So still obey the guiding hand that fends
1707,BOOK II.,Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.
1708,BOOK II.,'Tis a concealment needful in extreme;
1709,BOOK II.,"And if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam"
1710,BOOK II.,Thou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!
1711,BOOK II.,"Here must we leave thee.""--At these words up flew             580"
1712,BOOK II.,"The impatient doves, up rose the floating car,"
1713,BOOK II.,Up went the hum celestial. High afar
1714,BOOK II.,The Latmian saw them minish into nought;
1715,BOOK II.,"And, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught"
1716,BOOK II.,A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.
1717,BOOK II.,"When all was darkened, with Etnean throe"
1718,BOOK II.,The earth clos'd--gave a solitary moan--
1719,BOOK II.,And left him once again in twilight lone.
1720,BOOK II.,
1721,BOOK II.,"He did not rave, he did not stare aghast,"
1722,BOOK II.,"For all those visions were o'ergone, and past,                590"
1723,BOOK II.,And he in loneliness: he felt assur'd
1724,BOOK II.,"Of happy times, when all he had endur'd"
1725,BOOK II.,Would seem a feather to the mighty prize.
1726,BOOK II.,"So, with unusual gladness, on he hies"
1727,BOOK II.,"Through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,"
1728,BOOK II.,"Gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,"
1729,BOOK II.,"Black polish'd porticos of awful shade,"
1730,BOOK II.,"And, at the last, a diamond balustrade,"
1731,BOOK II.,"Leading afar past wild magnificence,"
1732,BOOK II.,"Spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence                600"
1733,BOOK II.,"Stretching across a void, then guiding o'er"
1734,BOOK II.,"Enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,"
1735,BOOK II.,Streams subterranean tease their granite beds;
1736,BOOK II.,Then heighten'd just above the silvery heads
1737,BOOK II.,"Of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash"
1738,BOOK II.,"The waters with his spear; but at the splash,"
1739,BOOK II.,"Done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose"
1740,BOOK II.,"Sudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose"
1741,BOOK II.,"His diamond path with fretwork, streaming round"
1742,BOOK II.,"Alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,                   610"
1743,BOOK II.,"Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells"
1744,BOOK II.,Welcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells
1745,BOOK II.,"On this delight; for, every minute's space,"
1746,BOOK II.,The streams with changed magic interlace:
1747,BOOK II.,"Sometimes like delicatest lattices,"
1748,BOOK II.,"Cover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,"
1749,BOOK II.,"Moving about as in a gentle wind,"
1750,BOOK II.,"Which, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,"
1751,BOOK II.,"Pour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,"
1752,BOOK II.,"Spangled, and rich with liquid broideries                     620"
1753,BOOK II.,"Of flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair."
1754,BOOK II.,Swifter than lightning went these wonders rare;
1755,BOOK II.,"And then the water, into stubborn streams"
1756,BOOK II.,"Collecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,"
1757,BOOK II.,"Pillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,"
1758,BOOK II.,Of those dusk places in times far aloof
1759,BOOK II.,Cathedrals call'd. He bade a loth farewel
1760,BOOK II.,"To these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,"
1761,BOOK II.,"And torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,"
1762,BOOK II.,"Half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,           630"
1763,BOOK II.,"Blackening on every side, and overhead"
1764,BOOK II.,"A vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread"
1765,BOOK II.,"With starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,"
1766,BOOK II.,The solitary felt a hurried change
1767,BOOK II.,"Working within him into something dreary,--"
1768,BOOK II.,"Vex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,"
1769,BOOK II.,"And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds."
1770,BOOK II.,But he revives at once: for who beholds
1771,BOOK II.,"New sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?"
1772,BOOK II.,"Forth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,                  640"
1773,BOOK II.,Came mother Cybele! alone--alone--
1774,BOOK II.,In sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown
1775,BOOK II.,"About her majesty, and front death-pale,"
1776,BOOK II.,With turrets crown'd. Four maned lions hale
1777,BOOK II.,"The sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,"
1778,BOOK II.,"Their surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws"
1779,BOOK II.,"Uplifted drowsily, and nervy tails"
1780,BOOK II.,Cowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails
1781,BOOK II.,"This shadowy queen athwart, and faints away"
1782,BOOK II.,In another gloomy arch.                                       650
1783,BOOK II.,
1784,BOOK II.,"Wherefore delay,"
1785,BOOK II.,"Young traveller, in such a mournful place?"
1786,BOOK II.,"Art thou wayworn, or canst not further trace"
1787,BOOK II.,The diamond path? And does it indeed end
1788,BOOK II.,Abrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend
1789,BOOK II.,"Thy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne"
1790,BOOK II.,Call ardently! He was indeed wayworn;
1791,BOOK II.,"Abrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;"
1792,BOOK II.,"To cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost"
1793,BOOK II.,"Towards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,                660"
1794,BOOK II.,"Without one impious word, himself he flings,"
1795,BOOK II.,Committed to the darkness and the gloom:
1796,BOOK II.,"Down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,"
1797,BOOK II.,Swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell
1798,BOOK II.,"Through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,"
1799,BOOK II.,"And rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,"
1800,BOOK II.,Came swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd
1801,BOOK II.,"So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd"
1802,BOOK II.,"Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd"
1803,BOOK II.,With airs delicious. In the greenest nook                     670
1804,BOOK II.,"The eagle landed him, and farewel took."
1805,BOOK II.,
1806,BOOK II.,"It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown"
1807,BOOK II.,With golden moss. His every sense had grown
1808,BOOK II.,Ethereal for pleasure; 'bove his head
1809,BOOK II.,Flew a delight half-graspable; his tread
1810,BOOK II.,Was Hesperean; to his capable ears
1811,BOOK II.,Silence was music from the holy spheres;
1812,BOOK II.,A dewy luxury was in his eyes;
1813,BOOK II.,The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs
1814,BOOK II.,And stirr'd them faintly. Verdant cave and cell               680
1815,BOOK II.,"He wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell"
1816,BOOK II.,"Of sudden exaltation: but, ""Alas!"
1817,BOOK II.,"Said he, ""will all this gush of feeling pass"
1818,BOOK II.,"Away in solitude? And must they wane,"
1819,BOOK II.,"Like melodies upon a sandy plain,"
1820,BOOK II.,Without an echo? Then shall I be left
1821,BOOK II.,"So sad, so melancholy, so bereft!"
1822,BOOK II.,"Yet still I feel immortal! O my love,"
1823,BOOK II.,"My breath of life, where art thou? High above,"
1824,BOOK II.,Dancing before the morning gates of heaven?                   690
1825,BOOK II.,"Or keeping watch among those starry seven,"
1826,BOOK II.,"Old Atlas' children? Art a maid of the waters,"
1827,BOOK II.,One of shell-winding Triton's bright-hair'd daughters?
1828,BOOK II.,"Or art, impossible! a nymph of Dian's,"
1829,BOOK II.,Weaving a coronal of tender scions
1830,BOOK II.,"For very idleness? Where'er thou art,"
1831,BOOK II.,Methinks it now is at my will to start
1832,BOOK II.,"Into thine arms; to scare Aurora's train,"
1833,BOOK II.,And snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main
1834,BOOK II.,"To scud like a wild bird, and take thee off                   700"
1835,BOOK II.,From thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff
1836,BOOK II.,"Thy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves."
1837,BOOK II.,"No, no, too eagerly my soul deceives"
1838,BOOK II.,Its powerless self: I know this cannot be.
1839,BOOK II.,O let me then by some sweet dreaming flee
1840,BOOK II.,To her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!
1841,BOOK II.,Hither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil
1842,BOOK II.,"For some few hours the coming solitude."""
1843,BOOK II.,
1844,BOOK II.,"Thus spake he, and that moment felt endued"
1845,BOOK II.,With power to dream deliciously; so wound                     710
1846,BOOK II.,"Through a dim passage, searching till he found"
1847,BOOK II.,"The smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where"
1848,BOOK II.,"He threw himself, and just into the air"
1849,BOOK II.,"Stretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!"
1850,BOOK II.,"A naked waist: ""Fair Cupid, whence is this?"""
1851,BOOK II.,"A well-known voice sigh'd, ""Sweetest, here am I!"""
1852,BOOK II.,"At which soft ravishment, with doating cry"
1853,BOOK II.,They trembled to each other.--Helicon!
1854,BOOK II.,O fountain'd hill! Old Homer's Helicon!
1855,BOOK II.,That thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er               720
1856,BOOK II.,These sorry pages; then the verse would soar
1857,BOOK II.,"And sing above this gentle pair, like lark"
1858,BOOK II.,Over his nested young: but all is dark
1859,BOOK II.,"Around thine aged top, and thy clear fount"
1860,BOOK II.,"Exhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count"
1861,BOOK II.,Of mighty Poets is made up; the scroll
1862,BOOK II.,Is folded by the Muses; the bright roll
1863,BOOK II.,Is in Apollo's hand: our dazed eyes
1864,BOOK II.,Have seen a new tinge in the western skies:
1865,BOOK II.,"The world has done its duty. Yet, oh yet,                     730"
1866,BOOK II.,"Although the sun of poesy is set,"
1867,BOOK II.,"These lovers did embrace, and we must weep"
1868,BOOK II.,That there is no old power left to steep
1869,BOOK II.,A quill immortal in their joyous tears.
1870,BOOK II.,Long time in silence did their anxious fears
1871,BOOK II.,Question that thus it was; long time they lay
1872,BOOK II.,Fondling and kissing every doubt away;
1873,BOOK II.,Long time ere soft caressing sobs began
1874,BOOK II.,"To mellow into words, and then there ran"
1875,BOOK II.,Two bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.           740
1876,BOOK II.,"""O known Unknown! from whom my being sips"
1877,BOOK II.,"Such darling essence, wherefore may I not"
1878,BOOK II.,Be ever in these arms? in this sweet spot
1879,BOOK II.,Pillow my chin for ever? ever press
1880,BOOK II.,These toying hands and kiss their smooth excess?
1881,BOOK II.,Why not for ever and for ever feel
1882,BOOK II.,"That breath about my eyes? Ah, thou wilt steal"
1883,BOOK II.,"Away from me again, indeed, indeed--"
1884,BOOK II.,"Thou wilt be gone away, and wilt not heed"
1885,BOOK II.,"My lonely madness. Speak, my kindest fair!                    750"
1886,BOOK II.,Is--is it to be so? No! Who will dare
1887,BOOK II.,"To pluck thee from me? And, of thine own will,"
1888,BOOK II.,Full well I feel thou wouldst not leave me. Still
1889,BOOK II.,"Let me entwine thee surer, surer--now"
1890,BOOK II.,How can we part? Elysium! who art thou?
1891,BOOK II.,"Who, that thou canst not be for ever here,"
1892,BOOK II.,Or lift me with thee to some starry sphere?
1893,BOOK II.,"Enchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,"
1894,BOOK II.,"By the most soft completion of thy face,"
1895,BOOK II.,"Those lips, O slippery blisses, twinkling eyes,               760"
1896,BOOK II.,"And by these tenderest, milky sovereignties--"
1897,BOOK II.,"These tenderest, and by the nectar-wine,"
1898,BOOK II.,"The passion""----""O lov'd Ida the divine!"
1899,BOOK II.,"Endymion! dearest! Ah, unhappy me!"
1900,BOOK II.,His soul will 'scape us--O felicity!
1901,BOOK II.,How he does love me! His poor temples beat
1902,BOOK II.,"To the very tune of love--how sweet, sweet, sweet."
1903,BOOK II.,"Revive, dear youth, or I shall faint and die;"
1904,BOOK II.,"Revive, or these soft hours will hurry by"
1905,BOOK II.,"In tranced dulness; speak, and let that spell                 770"
1906,BOOK II.,Affright this lethargy! I cannot quell
1907,BOOK II.,"Its heavy pressure, and will press at least"
1908,BOOK II.,"My lips to thine, that they may richly feast"
1909,BOOK II.,Until we taste the life of love again.
1910,BOOK II.,What! dost thou move? dost kiss? O bliss! O pain!
1911,BOOK II.,"I love thee, youth, more than I can conceive;"
1912,BOOK II.,And so long absence from thee doth bereave
1913,BOOK II.,My soul of any rest: yet must I hence:
1914,BOOK II.,"Yet, can I not to starry eminence"
1915,BOOK II.,Uplift thee; nor for very shame can own                       780
1916,BOOK II.,"Myself to thee. Ah, dearest, do not groan"
1917,BOOK II.,"Or thou wilt force me from this secrecy,"
1918,BOOK II.,And I must blush in heaven. O that I
1919,BOOK II.,Had done it already; that the dreadful smiles
1920,BOOK II.,"At my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,"
1921,BOOK II.,"Had waned from Olympus' solemn height,"
1922,BOOK II.,And from all serious Gods; that our delight
1923,BOOK II.,"Was quite forgotten, save of us alone!"
1924,BOOK II.,And wherefore so ashamed? 'Tis but to atone
1925,BOOK II.,"For endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:                 790"
1926,BOOK II.,Yet must I be a coward!--Honour rushes
1927,BOOK II.,Too palpable before me--the sad look
1928,BOOK II.,Of Jove--Minerva's start--no bosom shook
1929,BOOK II.,With awe of purity--no Cupid pinion
1930,BOOK II.,In reverence veiled--my crystalline dominion
1931,BOOK II.,"Half lost, and all old hymns made nullity!"
1932,BOOK II.,But what is this to love? O I could fly
1933,BOOK II.,"With thee into the ken of heavenly powers,"
1934,BOOK II.,"So thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,"
1935,BOOK II.,Press me so sweetly. Now I swear at once                      800
1936,BOOK II.,"That I am wise, that Pallas is a dunce--"
1937,BOOK II.,Perhaps her love like mine is but unknown--
1938,BOOK II.,O I do think that I have been alone
1939,BOOK II.,"In chastity: yes, Pallas has been sighing,"
1940,BOOK II.,While every eye saw me my hair uptying
1941,BOOK II.,"With fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,"
1942,BOOK II.,"I was as vague as solitary dove,"
1943,BOOK II.,Nor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss--
1944,BOOK II.,"Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,"
1945,BOOK II.,An immortality of passion's thine:                            810
1946,BOOK II.,Ere long I will exalt thee to the shine
1947,BOOK II.,Of heaven ambrosial; and we will shade
1948,BOOK II.,Ourselves whole summers by a river glade;
1949,BOOK II.,"And I will tell thee stories of the sky,"
1950,BOOK II.,And breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy.
1951,BOOK II.,My happy love will overwing all bounds!
1952,BOOK II.,O let me melt into thee; let the sounds
1953,BOOK II.,Of our close voices marry at their birth;
1954,BOOK II.,Let us entwine hoveringly--O dearth
1955,BOOK II.,Of human words! roughness of mortal speech!                   820
1956,BOOK II.,Lispings empyrean will I sometime teach
1957,BOOK II.,"Thine honied tongue--lute-breathings, which I gasp"
1958,BOOK II.,"To have thee understand, now while I clasp"
1959,BOOK II.,"Thee thus, and weep for fondness--I am pain'd,"
1960,BOOK II.,Endymion: woe! woe! is grief contain'd
1961,BOOK II.,"In the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?""--"
1962,BOOK II.,"Hereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife"
1963,BOOK II.,Melted into a languor. He return'd
1964,BOOK II.,Entranced vows and tears.
1965,BOOK II.,
1966,BOOK II.,Ye who have yearn'd                 830
1967,BOOK II.,"With too much passion, will here stay and pity,"
1968,BOOK II.,For the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty
1969,BOOK II.,"Not of these days, but long ago 'twas told"
1970,BOOK II.,By a cavern wind unto a forest old;
1971,BOOK II.,And then the forest told it in a dream
1972,BOOK II.,"To a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam"
1973,BOOK II.,A poet caught as he was journeying
1974,BOOK II.,To Phoebus' shrine; and in it he did fling
1975,BOOK II.,"His weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,"
1976,BOOK II.,"And after, straight in that inspired place                    840"
1977,BOOK II.,"He sang the story up into the air,"
1978,BOOK II.,Giving it universal freedom. There
1979,BOOK II.,Has it been ever sounding for those ears
1980,BOOK II.,Whose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers
1981,BOOK II.,Yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it
1982,BOOK II.,Must surely be self-doomed or he will rue it:
1983,BOOK II.,"For quenchless burnings come upon the heart,"
1984,BOOK II.,Made fiercer by a fear lest any part
1985,BOOK II.,Should be engulphed in the eddying wind.
1986,BOOK II.,As much as here is penn'd doth always find                    850
1987,BOOK II.,"A resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;"
1988,BOOK II.,Anon the strange voice is upon the wane--
1989,BOOK II.,"And 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,"
1990,BOOK II.,That the fair visitant at last unwound
1991,BOOK II.,"Her gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep.--"
1992,BOOK II.,Thus the tradition of the gusty deep.
1993,BOOK II.,
1994,BOOK II.,Now turn we to our former chroniclers.--
1995,BOOK II.,"Endymion awoke, that grief of hers"
1996,BOOK II.,Sweet paining on his ear: he sickly guess'd
1997,BOOK II.,"How lone he was once more, and sadly press'd                  860"
1998,BOOK II.,"His empty arms together, hung his head,"
1999,BOOK II.,And most forlorn upon that widow'd bed
2000,BOOK II.,Sat silently. Love's madness he had known:
2001,BOOK II.,Often with more than tortured lion's groan
2002,BOOK II.,Moanings had burst from him; but now that rage
2003,BOOK II.,Had pass'd away: no longer did he wage
2004,BOOK II.,A rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars.
2005,BOOK II.,"No, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:"
2006,BOOK II.,The lyre of his soul Eolian tun'd
2007,BOOK II.,"Forgot all violence, and but commun'd                         870"
2008,BOOK II.,With melancholy thought: O he had swoon'd
2009,BOOK II.,Drunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love
2010,BOOK II.,Henceforth was dove-like.--Loth was he to move
2011,BOOK II.,"From the imprinted couch, and when he did,"
2012,BOOK II.,"'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid"
2013,BOOK II.,"In muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd"
2014,BOOK II.,Half seeing visions that might have dismay'd
2015,BOOK II.,Alecto's serpents; ravishments more keen
2016,BOOK II.,"Than Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean"
2017,BOOK II.,Over eclipsing eyes: and at the last                          880
2018,BOOK II.,"It was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,"
2019,BOOK II.,"O'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,"
2020,BOOK II.,"And crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,"
2021,BOOK II.,"Of every shape and size, even to the bulk"
2022,BOOK II.,"In which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk"
2023,BOOK II.,"Against an endless storm. Moreover too,"
2024,BOOK II.,"Fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,"
2025,BOOK II.,Ready to snort their streams. In this cool wonder
2026,BOOK II.,"Endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder"
2027,BOOK II.,"On all his life: his youth, up to the day                     890"
2028,BOOK II.,"When 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,"
2029,BOOK II.,He stept upon his shepherd throne: the look
2030,BOOK II.,"Of his white palace in wild forest nook,"
2031,BOOK II.,And all the revels he had lorded there:
2032,BOOK II.,"Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,"
2033,BOOK II.,With every friend and fellow-woodlander--
2034,BOOK II.,Pass'd like a dream before him. Then the spur
2035,BOOK II.,Of the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans
2036,BOOK II.,To nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans:
2037,BOOK II.,That wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:                  900
2038,BOOK II.,"His sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,"
2039,BOOK II.,Until into the earth's deep maw he rush'd:
2040,BOOK II.,"Then all its buried magic, till it flush'd"
2041,BOOK II.,"High with excessive love. ""And now,"" thought he,"
2042,BOOK II.,"""How long must I remain in jeopardy"
2043,BOOK II.,Of blank amazements that amaze no more?
2044,BOOK II.,Now I have tasted her sweet soul to the core
2045,BOOK II.,"All other depths are shallow: essences,"
2046,BOOK II.,"Once spiritual, are like muddy lees,"
2047,BOOK II.,"Meant but to fertilize my earthly root,                       910"
2048,BOOK II.,And make my branches lift a golden fruit
2049,BOOK II.,"Into the bloom of heaven: other light,"
2050,BOOK II.,Though it be quick and sharp enough to blight
2051,BOOK II.,"The Olympian eagle's vision, is dark,"
2052,BOOK II.,Dark as the parentage of chaos. Hark!
2053,BOOK II.,My silent thoughts are echoing from these shells;
2054,BOOK II.,"Or they are but the ghosts, the dying swells"
2055,BOOK II.,"Of noises far away?--list!""--Hereupon"
2056,BOOK II.,He kept an anxious ear. The humming tone
2057,BOOK II.,"Came louder, and behold, there as he lay,                     920"
2058,BOOK II.,"On either side outgush'd, with misty spray,"
2059,BOOK II.,A copious spring; and both together dash'd
2060,BOOK II.,"Swift, mad, fantastic round the rocks, and lash'd"
2061,BOOK II.,"Among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,"
2062,BOOK II.,Leaving a trickling dew. At last they shot
2063,BOOK II.,"Down from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise"
2064,BOOK II.,As of some breathless racers whose hopes poize
2065,BOOK II.,"Upon the last few steps, and with spent force"
2066,BOOK II.,Along the ground they took a winding course.
2067,BOOK II.,Endymion follow'd--for it seem'd that one                     930
2068,BOOK II.,"Ever pursued, the other strove to shun--"
2069,BOOK II.,"Follow'd their languid mazes, till well nigh"
2070,BOOK II.,"He had left thinking of the mystery,--"
2071,BOOK II.,And was now rapt in tender hoverings
2072,BOOK II.,Over the vanish'd bliss. Ah! what is it sings
2073,BOOK II.,His dream away? What melodies are these?
2074,BOOK II.,"They sound as through the whispering of trees,"
2075,BOOK II.,Not native in such barren vaults. Give ear!
2076,BOOK II.,
2077,BOOK II.,"""O Arethusa, peerless nymph! why fear"
2078,BOOK II.,"Such tenderness as mine? Great Dian, why,                     940"
2079,BOOK II.,Why didst thou hear her prayer? O that I
2080,BOOK II.,"Were rippling round her dainty fairness now,"
2081,BOOK II.,"Circling about her waist, and striving how"
2082,BOOK II.,To entice her to a dive! then stealing in
2083,BOOK II.,Between her luscious lips and eyelids thin.
2084,BOOK II.,"O that her shining hair was in the sun,"
2085,BOOK II.,And I distilling from it thence to run
2086,BOOK II.,In amorous rillets down her shrinking form!
2087,BOOK II.,"To linger on her lily shoulders, warm"
2088,BOOK II.,"Between her kissing breasts, and every charm                  950"
2089,BOOK II.,Touch raptur'd!--See how painfully I flow:
2090,BOOK II.,"Fair maid, be pitiful to my great woe."
2091,BOOK II.,"Stay, stay thy weary course, and let me lead,"
2092,BOOK II.,"A happy wooer, to the flowery mead"
2093,BOOK II.,"Where all that beauty snar'd me.""--""Cruel god,"
2094,BOOK II.,Desist! or my offended mistress' nod
2095,BOOK II.,Will stagnate all thy fountains:--tease me not
2096,BOOK II.,"With syren words--Ah, have I really got"
2097,BOOK II.,Such power to madden thee? And is it true--
2098,BOOK II.,"Away, away, or I shall dearly rue                             960"
2099,BOOK II.,"My very thoughts: in mercy then away,"
2100,BOOK II.,"Kindest Alpheus, for should I obey"
2101,BOOK II.,"My own dear will, 'twould be a deadly bane.""--"
2102,BOOK II.,"""O, Oread-Queen! would that thou hadst a pain"
2103,BOOK II.,"Like this of mine, then would I fearless turn"
2104,BOOK II.,"And be a criminal.""--""Alas, I burn,"
2105,BOOK II.,"I shudder--gentle river, get thee hence."
2106,BOOK II.,Alpheus! thou enchanter! every sense
2107,BOOK II.,Of mine was once made perfect in these woods.
2108,BOOK II.,"Fresh breezes, bowery lawns, and innocent floods,             970"
2109,BOOK II.,"Ripe fruits, and lonely couch, contentment gave;"
2110,BOOK II.,But ever since I heedlessly did lave
2111,BOOK II.,"In thy deceitful stream, a panting glow"
2112,BOOK II.,"Grew strong within me: wherefore serve me so,"
2113,BOOK II.,"And call it love? Alas, 'twas cruelty."
2114,BOOK II.,Not once more did I close my happy eyes
2115,BOOK II.,Amid the thrush's song. Away! Avaunt!
2116,BOOK II.,"O 'twas a cruel thing.""--""Now thou dost taunt"
2117,BOOK II.,"So softly, Arethusa, that I think"
2118,BOOK II.,"If thou wast playing on my shady brink,                       980"
2119,BOOK II.,Thou wouldst bathe once again. Innocent maid!
2120,BOOK II.,Stifle thine heart no more:--nor be afraid
2121,BOOK II.,Of angry powers: there are deities
2122,BOOK II.,Will shade us with their wings. Those fitful sighs
2123,BOOK II.,'Tis almost death to hear: O let me pour
2124,BOOK II.,"A dewy balm upon them!--fear no more,"
2125,BOOK II.,Sweet Arethusa! Dian's self must feel
2126,BOOK II.,"Sometimes these very pangs. Dear maiden, steal"
2127,BOOK II.,"Blushing into my soul, and let us fly"
2128,BOOK II.,These dreary caverns for the open sky.                        990
2129,BOOK II.,"I will delight thee all my winding course,"
2130,BOOK II.,From the green sea up to my hidden source
2131,BOOK II.,About Arcadian forests; and will shew
2132,BOOK II.,The channels where my coolest waters flow
2133,BOOK II.,"Through mossy rocks; where, 'mid exuberant green,"
2134,BOOK II.,"I roam in pleasant darkness, more unseen"
2135,BOOK II.,Than Saturn in his exile; where I brim
2136,BOOK II.,"Round flowery islands, and take thence a skim"
2137,BOOK II.,"Of mealy sweets, which myriads of bees"
2138,BOOK II.,Buzz from their honied wings: and thou shouldst please
2139,BOOK II.,"Thyself to choose the richest, where we might                1001"

2142,BOOK II.,And let us be thus comforted; unless
2143,BOOK II.,Thou couldst rejoice to see my hopeless stream
2144,BOOK II.,"Hurry distracted from Sol's temperate beam,"
2145,BOOK II.,"And pour to death along some hungry sands.""--"
2146,BOOK II.,"""What can I do, Alpheus? Dian stands"

2150,BOOK II.,Those two sad streams adown a fearful dell.
2151,BOOK II.,"The Latmian listen'd, but he heard no more,"
2152,BOOK II.,"Save echo, faint repeating o'er and o'er"
2153,BOOK II.,The name of Arethusa. On the verge
2154,BOOK II.,"Of that dark gulph he wept, and said: ""I urge"
2155,BOOK II.,"Thee, gentle Goddess of my pilgrimage,"
2156,BOOK II.,"By our eternal hopes, to soothe, to assuage,"
2157,BOOK II.,"If thou art powerful, these lovers pains;"
2158,BOOK II.,And make them happy in some happy plains.                    1020
2159,BOOK II.,
2160,BOOK II.,"He turn'd--there was a whelming sound--he stept,"
2161,BOOK II.,There was a cooler light; and so he kept
2162,BOOK II.,"Towards it by a sandy path, and lo!"
2163,BOOK II.,"More suddenly than doth a moment go,"
2164,BOOK II.,The visions of the earth were gone and fled--
2165,BOOK II.,He saw the giant sea above his head.

2174,BOOK III.,
2175,BOOK III.,There are who lord it o'er their fellow-men
2176,BOOK III.,With most prevailing tinsel: who unpen
2177,BOOK III.,"Their baaing vanities, to browse away"
2178,BOOK III.,The comfortable green and juicy hay
2179,BOOK III.,"From human pastures; or, O torturing fact!"
2180,BOOK III.,"Who, through an idiot blink, will see unpack'd"
2181,BOOK III.,Fire-branded foxes to sear up and singe
2182,BOOK III.,Our gold and ripe-ear'd hopes. With not one tinge
2183,BOOK III.,"Of sanctuary splendour, not a sight"
2184,BOOK III.,"Able to face an owl's, they still are dight                    10"
2185,BOOK III.,"By the blear-eyed nations in empurpled vests,"
2186,BOOK III.,"And crowns, and turbans. With unladen breasts,"
2187,BOOK III.,"Save of blown self-applause, they proudly mount"
2188,BOOK III.,"To their spirit's perch, their being's high account,"
2189,BOOK III.,"Their tiptop nothings, their dull skies, their thrones--"
2190,BOOK III.,Amid the fierce intoxicating tones
2191,BOOK III.,"Of trumpets, shoutings, and belabour'd drums,"
2192,BOOK III.,"And sudden cannon. All! how all this hums,"
2193,BOOK III.,"In wakeful ears, like uproar past and gone--"
2194,BOOK III.,"Like thunder clouds that spake to Babylon,                     20"
2195,BOOK III.,And set those old Chaldeans to their tasks.--
2196,BOOK III.,Are then regalities all gilded masks?
2197,BOOK III.,"No, there are throned seats unscalable"
2198,BOOK III.,"But by a patient wing, a constant spell,"
2199,BOOK III.,"Or by ethereal things that, unconfin'd,"
2200,BOOK III.,"Can make a ladder of the eternal wind,"
2201,BOOK III.,And poise about in cloudy thunder-tents
2202,BOOK III.,To watch the abysm-birth of elements.
2203,BOOK III.,"Aye, 'bove the withering of old-lipp'd Fate"
2204,BOOK III.,"A thousand Powers keep religious state,                        30"

2207,BOOK III.,Hold sphery sessions for a season due.
2208,BOOK III.,"Yet few of these far majesties, ah, few!"
2209,BOOK III.,Have bared their operations to this globe--
2210,BOOK III.,"Few, who with gorgeous pageantry enrobe"
2211,BOOK III.,Our piece of heaven--whose benevolence
2212,BOOK III.,Shakes hand with our own Ceres; every sense
2213,BOOK III.,"Filling with spiritual sweets to plenitude,"
2214,BOOK III.,"As bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud               40"
2215,BOOK III.,"'Twixt Nothing and Creation, I here swear,"
2216,BOOK III.,Eterne Apollo! that thy Sister fair
2217,BOOK III.,Is of all these the gentlier-mightiest.
2218,BOOK III.,"When thy gold breath is misting in the west,"
2219,BOOK III.,"She unobserved steals unto her throne,"
2220,BOOK III.,And there she sits most meek and most alone;
2221,BOOK III.,As if she had not pomp subservient;
2222,BOOK III.,"As if thine eye, high Poet! was not bent"
2223,BOOK III.,Towards her with the Muses in thine heart;
2224,BOOK III.,"As if the ministring stars kept not apart,                     50"
2225,BOOK III.,Waiting for silver-footed messages.
2226,BOOK III.,O Moon! the oldest shades 'mong oldest trees
2227,BOOK III.,Feel palpitations when thou lookest in:
2228,BOOK III.,O Moon! old boughs lisp forth a holier din
2229,BOOK III.,The while they feel thine airy fellowship.
2230,BOOK III.,"Thou dost bless every where, with silver lip"
2231,BOOK III.,"Kissing dead things to life. The sleeping kine,"
2232,BOOK III.,"Couched in thy brightness, dream of fields divine:"

2235,BOOK III.,And yet thy benediction passeth not
2236,BOOK III.,"One obscure hiding-place, one little spot"
2237,BOOK III.,Where pleasure may be sent: the nested wren
2238,BOOK III.,"Has thy fair face within its tranquil ken,"
2239,BOOK III.,And from beneath a sheltering ivy leaf
2240,BOOK III.,Takes glimpses of thee; thou art a relief
2241,BOOK III.,"To the poor patient oyster, where it sleeps"
2242,BOOK III.,"Within its pearly house.--The mighty deeps,"
2243,BOOK III.,The monstrous sea is thine--the myriad sea!
2244,BOOK III.,"O Moon! far-spooming Ocean bows to thee,                       70"
2245,BOOK III.,And Tellus feels his forehead's cumbrous load.
2246,BOOK III.,
2247,BOOK III.,Cynthia! where art thou now? What far abode
2248,BOOK III.,Of green or silvery bower doth enshrine
2249,BOOK III.,"Such utmost beauty? Alas, thou dost pine"
2250,BOOK III.,For one as sorrowful: thy cheek is pale
2251,BOOK III.,For one whose cheek is pale: thou dost bewail
2252,BOOK III.,"His tears, who weeps for thee. Where dost thou sigh?"
2253,BOOK III.,"Ah! surely that light peeps from Vesper's eye,"
2254,BOOK III.,"Or what a thing is love! 'Tis She, but lo!"
2255,BOOK III.,"How chang'd, how full of ache, how gone in woe!                80"
2256,BOOK III.,She dies at the thinnest cloud; her loveliness
2257,BOOK III.,Is wan on Neptune's blue: yet there's a stress
2258,BOOK III.,"Of love-spangles, just off yon cape of trees,"
2259,BOOK III.,"Dancing upon the waves, as if to please"
2260,BOOK III.,The curly foam with amorous influence.
2261,BOOK III.,"O, not so idle: for down-glancing thence"
2262,BOOK III.,"She fathoms eddies, and runs wild about"
2263,BOOK III.,O'erwhelming water-courses; scaring out
2264,BOOK III.,"The thorny sharks from hiding-holes, and fright'ning"
2265,BOOK III.,Their savage eyes with unaccustomed lightning.                 90
2266,BOOK III.,Where will the splendor be content to reach?
2267,BOOK III.,O love! how potent hast thou been to teach
2268,BOOK III.,"Strange journeyings! Wherever beauty dwells,"
2269,BOOK III.,"In gulf or aerie, mountains or deep dells,"
2270,BOOK III.,"In light, in gloom, in star or blazing sun,"
2271,BOOK III.,"Thou pointest out the way, and straight 'tis won."
2272,BOOK III.,Amid his toil thou gav'st Leander breath;
2273,BOOK III.,Thou leddest Orpheus through the gleams of death;
2274,BOOK III.,Thou madest Pluto bear thin element;
2275,BOOK III.,"And now, O winged Chieftain! them hast sent                   100"
2276,BOOK III.,"A moon-beam to the deep, deep water-world,"
2277,BOOK III.,To find Endymion.
2278,BOOK III.,
2279,BOOK III.,On gold sand impearl'd
2280,BOOK III.,"With lily shells, and pebbles milky white,"
2281,BOOK III.,"Poor Cynthia greeted him, and sooth'd her light"
2282,BOOK III.,Against his pallid face: he felt the charm
2283,BOOK III.,"To breathlessness, and suddenly a warm"
2284,BOOK III.,Of his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd
2285,BOOK III.,"His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid"
2286,BOOK III.,"His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,                     110"
2287,BOOK III.,"To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,"
2288,BOOK III.,Lashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.
2289,BOOK III.,"And so he kept, until the rosy veils"
2290,BOOK III.,"Mantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand"
2291,BOOK III.,"Were lifted from the water's breast, and faun'd"
2292,BOOK III.,Into sweet air; and sober'd morning came
2293,BOOK III.,Meekly through billows:--when like taper-flame
2294,BOOK III.,"Left sudden by a dallying breath of air,"
2295,BOOK III.,"He rose in silence, and once more 'gan fare"
2296,BOOK III.,Along his fated way.                                          120
2297,BOOK III.,
2298,BOOK III.,"Far had he roam'd,"
2299,BOOK III.,"With nothing save the hollow vast, that foam'd"
2300,BOOK III.,"Above, around, and at his feet; save things"
2301,BOOK III.,More dead than Morpheus' imaginings:
2302,BOOK III.,"Old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large"
2303,BOOK III.,Of gone sea-warriors; brazen beaks and targe;
2304,BOOK III.,Rudders that for a hundred years had lost
2305,BOOK III.,The sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd
2306,BOOK III.,"With long-forgotten story, and wherein"
2307,BOOK III.,No reveller had ever dipp'd a chin                            130
2308,BOOK III.,"But those of Saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,"
2309,BOOK III.,"Writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls"
2310,BOOK III.,Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude
2311,BOOK III.,"In ponderous stone, developing the mood"
2312,BOOK III.,"Of ancient Nox;--then skeletons of man,"
2313,BOOK III.,"Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,"
2314,BOOK III.,"And elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw"
2315,BOOK III.,Of nameless monster. A cold leaden awe
2316,BOOK III.,These secrets struck into him; and unless
2317,BOOK III.,"Dian had chaced away that heaviness,                          140"
2318,BOOK III.,"He might have died: but now, with cheered feel,"
2319,BOOK III.,He onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal
2320,BOOK III.,About the labyrinth in his soul of love.
2321,BOOK III.,
2322,BOOK III.,"""What is there in thee, Moon! that thou shouldst move"
2323,BOOK III.,My heart so potently? When yet a child
2324,BOOK III.,I oft have dried my tears when thou hast smil'd.
2325,BOOK III.,Thou seem'dst my sister: hand in hand we went
2326,BOOK III.,From eve to morn across the firmament.
2327,BOOK III.,"No apples would I gather from the tree,"
2328,BOOK III.,Till thou hadst cool'd their cheeks deliciously:              150
2329,BOOK III.,"No tumbling water ever spake romance,"
2330,BOOK III.,But when my eyes with thine thereon could dance:
2331,BOOK III.,"No woods were green enough, no bower divine,"
2332,BOOK III.,Until thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine:
2333,BOOK III.,"In sowing time ne'er would I dibble take,"
2334,BOOK III.,"Or drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;"
2335,BOOK III.,"And, in the summer tide of blossoming,"
2336,BOOK III.,No one but thee hath heard me blithly sing
2337,BOOK III.,And mesh my dewy flowers all the night.
2338,BOOK III.,No melody was like a passing spright                          160
2339,BOOK III.,If it went not to solemnize thy reign.
2340,BOOK III.,"Yes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain"
2341,BOOK III.,By thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;
2342,BOOK III.,"And as I grew in years, still didst thou blend"
2343,BOOK III.,With all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;
2344,BOOK III.,Thou wast the mountain-top--the sage's pen--
2345,BOOK III.,The poet's harp--the voice of friends--the sun;
2346,BOOK III.,Thou wast the river--thou wast glory won;
2347,BOOK III.,Thou wast my clarion's blast--thou wast my steed--
2348,BOOK III.,My goblet full of wine--my topmost deed:--                    170
2349,BOOK III.,"Thou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!"
2350,BOOK III.,O what a wild and harmonized tune
2351,BOOK III.,My spirit struck from all the beautiful!
2352,BOOK III.,"On some bright essence could I lean, and lull"
2353,BOOK III.,Myself to immortality: I prest
2354,BOOK III.,Nature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.
2355,BOOK III.,"But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss--"
2356,BOOK III.,My strange love came--Felicity's abyss!
2357,BOOK III.,"She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away--"
2358,BOOK III.,"Yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway                         180"
2359,BOOK III.,Has been an under-passion to this hour.
2360,BOOK III.,Now I begin to feel thine orby power
2361,BOOK III.,"Is coming fresh upon me: O be kind,"
2362,BOOK III.,"Keep back thine influence, and do not blind"
2363,BOOK III.,"My sovereign vision.--Dearest love, forgive"
2364,BOOK III.,That I can think away from thee and live!--
2365,BOOK III.,"Pardon me, airy planet, that I prize"
2366,BOOK III.,One thought beyond thine argent luxuries!
2367,BOOK III.,"How far beyond!"" At this a surpris'd start"
2368,BOOK III.,Frosted the springing verdure of his heart;                   190
2369,BOOK III.,For as he lifted up his eyes to swear
2370,BOOK III.,"How his own goddess was past all things fair,"
2371,BOOK III.,He saw far in the concave green of the sea
2372,BOOK III.,An old man sitting calm and peacefully.
2373,BOOK III.,"Upon a weeded rock this old man sat,"
2374,BOOK III.,"And his white hair was awful, and a mat"
2375,BOOK III.,Of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;
2376,BOOK III.,"And, ample as the largest winding-sheet,"
2377,BOOK III.,"A cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,"
2378,BOOK III.,O'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans                200
2379,BOOK III.,Of ambitious magic: every ocean-form
2380,BOOK III.,"Was woven in with black distinctness; storm,"
2381,BOOK III.,"And calm, and whispering, and hideous roar"
2382,BOOK III.,Were emblem'd in the woof; with every shape
2383,BOOK III.,"That skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape."
2384,BOOK III.,"The gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,"
2385,BOOK III.,"Yet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell"
2386,BOOK III.,To its huge self; and the minutest fish
2387,BOOK III.,"Would pass the very hardest gazer's wish,"
2388,BOOK III.,And shew his little eye's anatomy.                            210
2389,BOOK III.,Then there was pictur'd the regality
2390,BOOK III.,"Of Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,"
2391,BOOK III.,"In beauteous vassalage, look up and wait."
2392,BOOK III.,"Beside this old man lay a pearly wand,"
2393,BOOK III.,"And in his lap a book, the which he conn'd"
2394,BOOK III.,"So stedfastly, that the new denizen"
2395,BOOK III.,"Had time to keep him in amazed ken,"
2396,BOOK III.,"To mark these shadowings, and stand in awe."
2397,BOOK III.,
2398,BOOK III.,The old man rais'd his hoary head and saw
2399,BOOK III.,"The wilder'd stranger--seeming not to see,                    220"
2400,BOOK III.,His features were so lifeless. Suddenly
2401,BOOK III.,He woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows
2402,BOOK III.,"Went arching up, and like two magic ploughs"
2403,BOOK III.,"Furrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,"
2404,BOOK III.,"Which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,"
2405,BOOK III.,Till round his wither'd lips had gone a smile.
2406,BOOK III.,"Then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil"
2407,BOOK III.,"Had watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,"
2408,BOOK III.,Who had not from mid-life to utmost age
2409,BOOK III.,"Eas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,                   230"
2410,BOOK III.,"Even to the trees. He rose: he grasp'd his stole,"
2411,BOOK III.,"With convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,"
2412,BOOK III.,"And in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd"
2413,BOOK III.,"Echo into oblivion, he said:--"
2414,BOOK III.,
2415,BOOK III.,"""Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head"
2416,BOOK III.,In peace upon my watery pillow: now
2417,BOOK III.,Sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.
2418,BOOK III.,"O Jove! I shall be young again, be young!"
2419,BOOK III.,"O shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc'd and stung"
2420,BOOK III.,"With new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,                240"
2421,BOOK III.,When I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?--
2422,BOOK III.,"I'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen"
2423,BOOK III.,"Their melodies, and see their long hair glisten;"
2424,BOOK III.,"Anon upon that giant's arm I'll be,"
2425,BOOK III.,That writhes about the roots of Sicily:
2426,BOOK III.,"To northern seas I'll in a twinkling sail,"
2427,BOOK III.,And mount upon the snortings of a whale
2428,BOOK III.,To some black cloud; thence down I'll madly sweep
2429,BOOK III.,"On forked lightning, to the deepest deep,"
2430,BOOK III.,Where through some sucking pool I will be hurl'd              250
2431,BOOK III.,With rapture to the other side of the world!
2432,BOOK III.,"O, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,"
2433,BOOK III.,I bow full hearted to your old decree!
2434,BOOK III.,"Yes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,"
2435,BOOK III.,"For I no more shall wither, droop, and pine."
2436,BOOK III.,"Thou art the man!"" Endymion started back"
2437,BOOK III.,"Dismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack"
2438,BOOK III.,"Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,"
2439,BOOK III.,"Mutter'd: ""What lonely death am I to die"
2440,BOOK III.,"In this cold region? Will he let me freeze,                   260"
2441,BOOK III.,And float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?
2442,BOOK III.,"Or will he touch me with his searing hand,"
2443,BOOK III.,And leave a black memorial on the sand?
2444,BOOK III.,"Or tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,"
2445,BOOK III.,And keep me as a chosen food to draw
2446,BOOK III.,His magian fish through hated fire and flame?
2447,BOOK III.,"O misery of hell! resistless, tame,"
2448,BOOK III.,"Am I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,"
2449,BOOK III.,Until the gods through heaven's blue look out!--
2450,BOOK III.,O Tartarus! but some few days agone                           270
2451,BOOK III.,"Her soft arms were entwining me, and on"
2452,BOOK III.,Her voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:
2453,BOOK III.,"Her lips were all my own, and--ah, ripe sheaves"
2454,BOOK III.,"Of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,"
2455,BOOK III.,But never may be garner'd. I must stoop
2456,BOOK III.,"My head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!"
2457,BOOK III.,Is there no hope from thee? This horrid spell
2458,BOOK III.,Would melt at thy sweet breath.--By Dian's hind
2459,BOOK III.,"Feeding from her white fingers, on the wind"
2460,BOOK III.,"I see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,                    280"
2461,BOOK III.,"I care not for this old mysterious man!"""
2462,BOOK III.,
2463,BOOK III.,"He spake, and walking to that aged form,"
2464,BOOK III.,Look'd high defiance. Lo! his heart 'gan warm
2465,BOOK III.,"With pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept."
2466,BOOK III.,Had he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?
2467,BOOK III.,"Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought"
2468,BOOK III.,"Rheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,"
2469,BOOK III.,Convulsion to a mouth of many years?
2470,BOOK III.,He had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.
2471,BOOK III.,"The penitent shower fell, as down he knelt                    290"
2472,BOOK III.,"Before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt"
2473,BOOK III.,"About his large dark locks, and faultering spake:"
2474,BOOK III.,
2475,BOOK III.,"""Arise, good youth, for sacred Phoebus' sake!"
2476,BOOK III.,"I know thine inmost bosom, and I feel"
2477,BOOK III.,A very brother's yearning for thee steal
2478,BOOK III.,Into mine own: for why? thou openest
2479,BOOK III.,The prison gates that have so long opprest
2480,BOOK III.,"My weary watching. Though thou know'st it not,"
2481,BOOK III.,Thou art commission'd to this fated spot
2482,BOOK III.,For great enfranchisement. O weep no more;                    300
2483,BOOK III.,"I am a friend to love, to loves of yore:"
2484,BOOK III.,"Aye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power,"
2485,BOOK III.,I had been grieving at this joyous hour.
2486,BOOK III.,"But even now most miserable old,"
2487,BOOK III.,"I saw thee, and my blood no longer cold"
2488,BOOK III.,Gave mighty pulses: in this tottering case
2489,BOOK III.,"Grew a new heart, which at this moment plays"
2490,BOOK III.,"As dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,"
2491,BOOK III.,"For thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,"

2493,BOOK III.,
2494,BOOK III.,"So saying, this young soul in age's mask"
2495,BOOK III.,Went forward with the Carian side by side:
2496,BOOK III.,Resuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide
2497,BOOK III.,"Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands"
2498,BOOK III.,Took silently their foot-prints.
2499,BOOK III.,
2500,BOOK III.,"""My soul stands"
2501,BOOK III.,"Now past the midway from mortality,"
2502,BOOK III.,And so I can prepare without a sigh
2503,BOOK III.,To tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.
2504,BOOK III.,"I was a fisher once, upon this main,                          320"
2505,BOOK III.,And my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;
2506,BOOK III.,"Rough billows were my home by night and day,--"
2507,BOOK III.,The sea-gulls not more constant; for I had
2508,BOOK III.,"No housing from the storm and tempests mad,"
2509,BOOK III.,"But hollow rocks,--and they were palaces"
2510,BOOK III.,"Of silent happiness, of slumberous ease:"
2511,BOOK III.,Long years of misery have told me so.
2512,BOOK III.,"Aye, thus it was one thousand years ago."
2513,BOOK III.,One thousand years!--Is it then possible
2514,BOOK III.,To look so plainly through them? to dispel                    330
2515,BOOK III.,A thousand years with backward glance sublime?
2516,BOOK III.,To breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime
2517,BOOK III.,"From off a crystal pool, to see its deep,"
2518,BOOK III.,And one's own image from the bottom peep?
2519,BOOK III.,"Yes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,"
2520,BOOK III.,My long captivity and moanings all
2521,BOOK III.,"Are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,"
2522,BOOK III.,"The which I breathe away, and thronging come"
2523,BOOK III.,Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.
2524,BOOK III.,
2525,BOOK III.,"""I touch'd no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:"
2526,BOOK III.,I was a lonely youth on desert shores.                        341
2527,BOOK III.,"My sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,"
2528,BOOK III.,"And craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry"
2529,BOOK III.,Plaining discrepant between sea and sky.
2530,BOOK III.,Dolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen
2531,BOOK III.,"Would let me feel their scales of gold and green,"
2532,BOOK III.,"Nor be my desolation; and, full oft,"
2533,BOOK III.,When a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft
2534,BOOK III.,"Its hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe"
2535,BOOK III.,"To burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe                  350"
2536,BOOK III.,"My life away like a vast sponge of fate,"
2537,BOOK III.,"Some friendly monster, pitying my sad state,"
2538,BOOK III.,"Has dived to its foundations, gulph'd it down,"
2539,BOOK III.,And left me tossing safely. But the crown
2540,BOOK III.,Of all my life was utmost quietude:
2541,BOOK III.,"More did I love to lie in cavern rude,"
2542,BOOK III.,"Keeping in wait whole days for Neptune's voice,"
2543,BOOK III.,"And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!"
2544,BOOK III.,There blush'd no summer eve but I would steer
2545,BOOK III.,"My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear                 360"
2546,BOOK III.,"The shepherd's pipe come clear from aery steep,"
2547,BOOK III.,Mingled with ceaseless bleatings of his sheep:
2548,BOOK III.,"And never was a day of summer shine,"
2549,BOOK III.,But I beheld its birth upon the brine:
2550,BOOK III.,For I would watch all night to see unfold
2551,BOOK III.,"Heaven's gates, and Æthon snort his morning gold"
2552,BOOK III.,Wide o'er the swelling streams: and constantly
2553,BOOK III.,"At brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,"
2554,BOOK III.,"My nets would be spread out, and I at rest."
2555,BOOK III.,The poor folk of the sea-country I blest                      370
2556,BOOK III.,With daily boon of fish most delicate:
2557,BOOK III.,"They knew not whence this bounty, and elate"
2558,BOOK III.,Would strew sweet flowers on a sterile beach.
2559,BOOK III.,
2560,BOOK III.,"""Why was I not contented? Wherefore reach"
2561,BOOK III.,"At things which, but for thee, O Latmian!"
2562,BOOK III.,Had been my dreary death? Fool! I began
2563,BOOK III.,To feel distemper'd longings: to desire
2564,BOOK III.,The utmost privilege that ocean's sire
2565,BOOK III.,Could grant in benediction: to be free
2566,BOOK III.,Of all his kingdom. Long in misery                            380
2567,BOOK III.,"I wasted, ere in one extremest fit"
2568,BOOK III.,I plung'd for life or death. To interknit
2569,BOOK III.,One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff
2570,BOOK III.,Might seem a work of pain; so not enough
2571,BOOK III.,"Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,"
2572,BOOK III.,And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt
2573,BOOK III.,Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;
2574,BOOK III.,Forgetful utterly of self-intent;
2575,BOOK III.,Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.
2576,BOOK III.,"Then, like a new fledg'd bird that first doth shew            390"
2577,BOOK III.,"His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,"
2578,BOOK III.,I tried in fear the pinions of my will.
2579,BOOK III.,'Twas freedom! and at once I visited
2580,BOOK III.,The ceaseless wonders of this ocean-bed.
2581,BOOK III.,"No need to tell thee of them, for I see"
2582,BOOK III.,That thou hast been a witness--it must be--
2583,BOOK III.,"For these I know thou canst not feel a drouth,"
2584,BOOK III.,By the melancholy corners of that mouth.
2585,BOOK III.,So I will in my story straightway pass
2586,BOOK III.,"To more immediate matter. Woe, alas!                          400"
2587,BOOK III.,"That love should be my bane! Ah, Scylla fair!"
2588,BOOK III.,Why did poor Glaucus ever--ever dare
2589,BOOK III.,To sue thee to his heart? Kind stranger-youth!
2590,BOOK III.,"I lov'd her to the very white of truth,"
2591,BOOK III.,And she would not conceive it. Timid thing!
2592,BOOK III.,"She fled me swift as sea-bird on the wing,"
2593,BOOK III.,"Round every isle, and point, and promontory,"
2594,BOOK III.,From where large Hercules wound up his story
2595,BOOK III.,Far as Egyptian Nile. My passion grew
2596,BOOK III.,"The more, the more I saw her dainty hue                       410"
2597,BOOK III.,Gleam delicately through the azure clear:
2598,BOOK III.,Until 'twas too fierce agony to bear;
2599,BOOK III.,"And in that agony, across my grief"
2600,BOOK III.,"It flash'd, that Circe might find some relief--"
2601,BOOK III.,Cruel enchantress! So above the water
2602,BOOK III.,"I rear'd my head, and look'd for Phoebus' daughter."
2603,BOOK III.,Ææa's isle was wondering at the moon:--
2604,BOOK III.,"It seem'd to whirl around me, and a swoon"
2605,BOOK III.,Left me dead-drifting to that fatal power.
2606,BOOK III.,
2607,BOOK III.,"""When I awoke, 'twas in a twilight bower;                   420"
2608,BOOK III.,"Just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,"
2609,BOOK III.,Stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.
2610,BOOK III.,"How sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,"
2611,BOOK III.,And over it a sighing voice expire.
2612,BOOK III.,It ceased--I caught light footsteps; and anon
2613,BOOK III.,The fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon
2614,BOOK III.,Push'd through a screen of roses. Starry Jove!
2615,BOOK III.,"With tears, and smiles, and honey-words she wove"
2616,BOOK III.,A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all
2617,BOOK III.,The range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall                  430
2618,BOOK III.,"The dew of her rich speech: ""Ah! Art awake?"
2619,BOOK III.,"O let me hear thee speak, for Cupid's sake!"
2620,BOOK III.,"I am so oppress'd with joy! Why, I have shed"
2621,BOOK III.,"An urn of tears, as though thou wert cold dead;"
2622,BOOK III.,"And now I find thee living, I will pour"
2623,BOOK III.,"From these devoted eyes their silver store,"
2624,BOOK III.,"Until exhausted of the latest drop,"
2625,BOOK III.,"So it will pleasure thee, and force thee stop"
2626,BOOK III.,"Here, that I too may live: but if beyond"
2627,BOOK III.,"Such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond              440"
2628,BOOK III.,"Of soothing warmth, of dalliance supreme;"
2629,BOOK III.,If thou art ripe to taste a long love dream;
2630,BOOK III.,"If smiles, if dimples, tongues for ardour mute,"
2631,BOOK III.,"Hang in thy vision like a tempting fruit,"
2632,BOOK III.,"O let me pluck it for thee."" Thus she link'd"
2633,BOOK III.,"Her charming syllables, till indistinct"
2634,BOOK III.,Their music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;
2635,BOOK III.,"And then she hover'd over me, and stole"
2636,BOOK III.,"So near, that if no nearer it had been"
2637,BOOK III.,This furrow'd visage thou hadst never seen.                   450
2638,BOOK III.,
2639,BOOK III.,"""Young man of Latmos! thus particular"
2640,BOOK III.,"Am I, that thou may'st plainly see how far"
2641,BOOK III.,This fierce temptation went: and thou may'st not
2642,BOOK III.,"Exclaim, How then, was Scylla quite forgot?"
2643,BOOK III.,
2644,BOOK III.,"""Who could resist? Who in this universe?"
2645,BOOK III.,She did so breathe ambrosia; so immerse
2646,BOOK III.,My fine existence in a golden clime.
2647,BOOK III.,"She took me like a child of suckling time,"
2648,BOOK III.,"And cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,"
2649,BOOK III.,"The current of my former life was stemm'd,                    460"
2650,BOOK III.,And to this arbitrary queen of sense
2651,BOOK III.,I bow'd a tranced vassal: nor would thence
2652,BOOK III.,"Have mov'd, even though Amphion's harp had woo'd"
2653,BOOK III.,Me back to Scylla o'er the billows rude.
2654,BOOK III.,For as Apollo each eve doth devise
2655,BOOK III.,A new appareling for western skies;
2656,BOOK III.,"So every eve, nay every spendthrift hour"
2657,BOOK III.,Shed balmy consciousness within that bower.
2658,BOOK III.,And I was free of haunts umbrageous;
2659,BOOK III.,Could wander in the mazy forest-house                         470
2660,BOOK III.,"Of squirrels, foxes shy, and antler'd deer,"
2661,BOOK III.,And birds from coverts innermost and drear
2662,BOOK III.,Warbling for very joy mellifluous sorrow--
2663,BOOK III.,To me new born delights!
2664,BOOK III.,
2665,BOOK III.,"""Now let me borrow,"
2666,BOOK III.,"For moments few, a temperament as stern"
2667,BOOK III.,"As Pluto's sceptre, that my words not burn"
2668,BOOK III.,"These uttering lips, while I in calm speech tell"
2669,BOOK III.,How specious heaven was changed to real hell.
2670,BOOK III.,
2671,BOOK III.,"""One morn she left me sleeping: half awake                  480"
2672,BOOK III.,"I sought for her smooth arms and lips, to slake"
2673,BOOK III.,My greedy thirst with nectarous camel-draughts;
2674,BOOK III.,But she was gone. Whereat the barbed shafts
2675,BOOK III.,"Of disappointment stuck in me so sore,"
2676,BOOK III.,That out I ran and search'd the forest o'er.
2677,BOOK III.,Wandering about in pine and cedar gloom
2678,BOOK III.,Damp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom
2679,BOOK III.,"A sound of moan, an agony of sound,"
2680,BOOK III.,Sepulchral from the distance all around.
2681,BOOK III.,"Then came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled             490"
2682,BOOK III.,That fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled
2683,BOOK III.,"Down a precipitous path, as if impell'd."
2684,BOOK III.,I came to a dark valley.--Groanings swell'd
2685,BOOK III.,"Poisonous about my ears, and louder grew,"
2686,BOOK III.,"The nearer I approach'd a flame's gaunt blue,"
2687,BOOK III.,That glar'd before me through a thorny brake.
2688,BOOK III.,"This fire, like the eye of gordian snake,"
2689,BOOK III.,Bewitch'd me towards; and I soon was near
2690,BOOK III.,A sight too fearful for the feel of fear:
2691,BOOK III.,In thicket hid I curs'd the haggard scene--                   500
2692,BOOK III.,"The banquet of my arms, my arbour queen,"
2693,BOOK III.,Seated upon an uptorn forest root;
2694,BOOK III.,"And all around her shapes, wizard and brute,"
2695,BOOK III.,"Laughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,"
2696,BOOK III.,"Shewing tooth, tusk, and venom-bag, and sting!"
2697,BOOK III.,"O such deformities! Old Charon's self,"
2698,BOOK III.,"Should he give up awhile his penny pelf,"
2699,BOOK III.,"And take a dream 'mong rushes Stygian,"
2700,BOOK III.,"It could not be so phantasied. Fierce, wan,"
2701,BOOK III.,"And tyrannizing was the lady's look,                          510"
2702,BOOK III.,As over them a gnarled staff she shook.
2703,BOOK III.,"Oft-times upon the sudden she laugh'd out,"
2704,BOOK III.,And from a basket emptied to the rout
2705,BOOK III.,"Clusters of grapes, the which they raven'd quick"
2706,BOOK III.,And roar'd for more; with many a hungry lick
2707,BOOK III.,"About their shaggy jaws. Avenging, slow,"
2708,BOOK III.,"Anon she took a branch of mistletoe,"
2709,BOOK III.,And emptied on't a black dull-gurgling phial:
2710,BOOK III.,"Groan'd one and all, as if some piercing trial"
2711,BOOK III.,Was sharpening for their pitiable bones.                      520
2712,BOOK III.,She lifted up the charm: appealing groans
2713,BOOK III.,From their poor breasts went sueing to her ear
2714,BOOK III.,In vain; remorseless as an infant's bier
2715,BOOK III.,She whisk'd against their eyes the sooty oil.
2716,BOOK III.,"Whereat was heard a noise of painful toil,"
2717,BOOK III.,"Increasing gradual to a tempest rage,"
2718,BOOK III.,"Shrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;"
2719,BOOK III.,Until their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat
2720,BOOK III.,And puff from the tail's end to stifled throat:
2721,BOOK III.,Then was appalling silence: then a sight                      530
2722,BOOK III.,More wildering than all that hoarse affright;
2723,BOOK III.,"For the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,"
2724,BOOK III.,Went through the dismal air like one huge Python
2725,BOOK III.,"Antagonizing Boreas,--and so vanish'd."
2726,BOOK III.,Yet there was not a breath of wind: she banish'd
2727,BOOK III.,These phantoms with a nod. Lo! from the dark
2728,BOOK III.,"Came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,"
2729,BOOK III.,"With dancing and loud revelry,--and went"
2730,BOOK III.,Swifter than centaurs after rapine bent.--
2731,BOOK III.,Sighing an elephant appear'd and bow'd                        540
2732,BOOK III.,"Before the fierce witch, speaking thus aloud"
2733,BOOK III.,"In human accent: ""Potent goddess! chief"
2734,BOOK III.,"Of pains resistless! make my being brief,"
2735,BOOK III.,Or let me from this heavy prison fly:
2736,BOOK III.,"Or give me to the air, or let me die!"
2737,BOOK III.,I sue not for my happy crown again;
2738,BOOK III.,I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;
2739,BOOK III.,"I sue not for my lone, my widow'd wife;"
2740,BOOK III.,"I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,"
2741,BOOK III.,"My children fair, my lovely girls and boys!                   550"
2742,BOOK III.,I will forget them; I will pass these joys;
2743,BOOK III.,"Ask nought so heavenward, so too--too high:"
2744,BOOK III.,"Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die,"
2745,BOOK III.,"Or be deliver'd from this cumbrous flesh,"
2746,BOOK III.,"From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,"
2747,BOOK III.,And merely given to the cold bleak air.
2748,BOOK III.,"Have mercy, Goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!"""
2749,BOOK III.,
2750,BOOK III.,That curst magician's name fell icy numb
2751,BOOK III.,Upon my wild conjecturing: truth had come
2752,BOOK III.,Naked and sabre-like against my heart.                        560
2753,BOOK III.,I saw a fury whetting a death-dart;
2754,BOOK III.,"And my slain spirit, overwrought with fright,"
2755,BOOK III.,Fainted away in that dark lair of night.
2756,BOOK III.,"Think, my deliverer, how desolate"
2757,BOOK III.,"My waking must have been! disgust, and hate,"
2758,BOOK III.,And terrors manifold divided me
2759,BOOK III.,A spoil amongst them. I prepar'd to flee
2760,BOOK III.,Into the dungeon core of that wild wood:
2761,BOOK III.,I fled three days--when lo! before me stood
2762,BOOK III.,"Glaring the angry witch. O Dis, even now,                     570"
2763,BOOK III.,"A clammy dew is beading on my brow,"
2764,BOOK III.,"At mere remembering her pale laugh, and curse."
2765,BOOK III.,"""Ha! ha! Sir Dainty! there must be a nurse"
2766,BOOK III.,"Made of rose leaves and thistledown, express,"
2767,BOOK III.,"To cradle thee my sweet, and lull thee: yes,"
2768,BOOK III.,I am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:
2769,BOOK III.,My tenderest squeeze is but a giant's clutch.
2770,BOOK III.,"So, fairy-thing, it shall have lullabies"
2771,BOOK III.,Unheard of yet; and it shall still its cries
2772,BOOK III.,Upon some breast more lily-feminine.                          580
2773,BOOK III.,"Oh, no--it shall not pine, and pine, and pine"
2774,BOOK III.,"More than one pretty, trifling thousand years;"
2775,BOOK III.,"And then 'twere pity, but fate's gentle shears"
2776,BOOK III.,Cut short its immortality. Sea-flirt!
2777,BOOK III.,Young dove of the waters! truly I'll not hurt
2778,BOOK III.,"One hair of thine: see how I weep and sigh,"
2779,BOOK III.,That our heart-broken parting is so nigh.
2780,BOOK III.,"And must we part? Ah, yes, it must be so."
2781,BOOK III.,"Yet ere thou leavest me in utter woe,"
2782,BOOK III.,"Let me sob over thee my last adieus,                          590"
2783,BOOK III.,And speak a blessing: Mark me! Thou hast thews
2784,BOOK III.,"Immortal, for thou art of heavenly race:"
2785,BOOK III.,"But such a love is mine, that here I chase"
2786,BOOK III.,Eternally away from thee all bloom
2787,BOOK III.,"Of youth, and destine thee towards a tomb."
2788,BOOK III.,Hence shalt thou quickly to the watery vast;
2789,BOOK III.,"And there, ere many days be overpast,"
2790,BOOK III.,Disabled age shall seize thee; and even then
2791,BOOK III.,Thou shalt not go the way of aged men;
2792,BOOK III.,"But live and wither, cripple and still breathe                600"
2793,BOOK III.,"Ten hundred years: which gone, I then bequeath"
2794,BOOK III.,Thy fragile bones to unknown burial.
2795,BOOK III.,"Adieu, sweet love, adieu!""--As shot stars fall,"
2796,BOOK III.,She fled ere I could groan for mercy. Stung
2797,BOOK III.,And poisoned was my spirit: despair sung
2798,BOOK III.,A war-song of defiance 'gainst all hell.
2799,BOOK III.,A hand was at my shoulder to compel
2800,BOOK III.,My sullen steps; another 'fore my eyes
2801,BOOK III.,Moved on with pointed finger. In this guise
2802,BOOK III.,"Enforced, at the last by ocean's foam                         610"
2803,BOOK III.,"I found me; by my fresh, my native home."
2804,BOOK III.,"Its tempering coolness, to my life akin,"
2805,BOOK III.,Came salutary as I waded in;
2806,BOOK III.,"And, with a blind voluptuous rage, I gave"
2807,BOOK III.,"Battle to the swollen billow-ridge, and drave"
2808,BOOK III.,"Large froth before me, while there yet remain'd"
2809,BOOK III.,"Hale strength, nor from my bones all marrow drain'd."
2810,BOOK III.,
2811,BOOK III.,"""Young lover, I must weep--such hellish spite"
2812,BOOK III.,With dry cheek who can tell? While thus my might
2813,BOOK III.,"Proving upon this element, dismay'd,                          620"
2814,BOOK III.,Upon a dead thing's face my hand I laid;
2815,BOOK III.,"I look'd--'twas Scylla! Cursed, cursed Circe!"
2816,BOOK III.,"O vulture-witch, hast never heard of mercy?"
2817,BOOK III.,"Could not thy harshest vengeance be content,"
2818,BOOK III.,But thou must nip this tender innocent
2819,BOOK III.,"Because I lov'd her?--Cold, O cold indeed"
2820,BOOK III.,"Were her fair limbs, and like a common weed"
2821,BOOK III.,The sea-swell took her hair. Dead as she was
2822,BOOK III.,"I clung about her waist, nor ceas'd to pass"
2823,BOOK III.,"Fleet as an arrow through unfathom'd brine,                   630"
2824,BOOK III.,"Until there shone a fabric crystalline,"
2825,BOOK III.,"Ribb'd and inlaid with coral, pebble, and pearl."
2826,BOOK III.,Headlong I darted; at one eager swirl
2827,BOOK III.,"Gain'd its bright portal, enter'd, and behold!"
2828,BOOK III.,"'Twas vast, and desolate, and icy-cold;"
2829,BOOK III.,And all around--But wherefore this to thee
2830,BOOK III.,Who in few minutes more thyself shalt see?--
2831,BOOK III.,I left poor Scylla in a niche and fled.
2832,BOOK III.,"My fever'd parchings up, my scathing dread"
2833,BOOK III.,Met palsy half way: soon these limbs became                   640
2834,BOOK III.,"Gaunt, wither'd, sapless, feeble, cramp'd, and lame."
2835,BOOK III.,
2836,BOOK III.,"""Now let me pass a cruel, cruel space,"
2837,BOOK III.,"Without one hope, without one faintest trace"
2838,BOOK III.,"Of mitigation, or redeeming bubble"
2839,BOOK III.,Of colour'd phantasy; for I fear 'twould trouble
2840,BOOK III.,Thy brain to loss of reason: and next tell
2841,BOOK III.,How a restoring chance came down to quell
2842,BOOK III.,One half of the witch in me.
2843,BOOK III.,
2844,BOOK III.,"""On a day,"
2845,BOOK III.,"Sitting upon a rock above the spray,                          650"
2846,BOOK III.,I saw grow up from the horizon's brink
2847,BOOK III.,A gallant vessel: soon she seem'd to sink
2848,BOOK III.,"Away from me again, as though her course"
2849,BOOK III.,Had been resum'd in spite of hindering force--
2850,BOOK III.,"So vanish'd: and not long, before arose"
2851,BOOK III.,"Dark clouds, and muttering of winds morose."
2852,BOOK III.,"Old Eolus would stifle his mad spleen,"
2853,BOOK III.,But could not: therefore all the billows green
2854,BOOK III.,Toss'd up the silver spume against the clouds.
2855,BOOK III.,The tempest came: I saw that vessel's shrouds                 660
2856,BOOK III.,In perilous bustle; while upon the deck
2857,BOOK III.,Stood trembling creatures. I beheld the wreck;
2858,BOOK III.,The final gulphing; the poor struggling souls:
2859,BOOK III.,I heard their cries amid loud thunder-rolls.
2860,BOOK III.,O they had all been sav'd but crazed eld
2861,BOOK III.,Annull'd my vigorous cravings: and thus quell'd
2862,BOOK III.,"And curb'd, think on't, O Latmian! did I sit"
2863,BOOK III.,"Writhing with pity, and a cursing fit"
2864,BOOK III.,"Against that hell-born Circe. The crew had gone,"
2865,BOOK III.,"By one and one, to pale oblivion;                             670"
2866,BOOK III.,"And I was gazing on the surges prone,"
2867,BOOK III.,"With many a scalding tear and many a groan,"
2868,BOOK III.,"When at my feet emerg'd an old man's hand,"
2869,BOOK III.,"Grasping this scroll, and this same slender wand."
2870,BOOK III.,I knelt with pain--reached out my hand--had grasp'd
2871,BOOK III.,These treasures--touch'd the knuckles--they unclasp'd--
2872,BOOK III.,I caught a finger: but the downward weight
2873,BOOK III.,O'erpowered me--it sank. Then 'gan abate
2874,BOOK III.,"The storm, and through chill aguish gloom outburst"
2875,BOOK III.,The comfortable sun. I was athirst                            680
2876,BOOK III.,"To search the book, and in the warming air"
2877,BOOK III.,Parted its dripping leaves with eager care.
2878,BOOK III.,"Strange matters did it treat of, and drew on"
2879,BOOK III.,"My soul page after page, till well-nigh won"
2880,BOOK III.,"Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,"
2881,BOOK III.,"I read these words, and read again, and tried"
2882,BOOK III.,"My eyes against the heavens, and read again."
2883,BOOK III.,O what a load of misery and pain
2884,BOOK III.,Each Atlas-line bore off!--a shine of hope
2885,BOOK III.,"Came gold around me, cheering me to cope                      690"
2886,BOOK III.,Strenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!
2887,BOOK III.,For thou hast brought their promise to an end.
2888,BOOK III.,
2889,BOOK III.,"""_In the wide sea there lives a forlorn wretch,"
2890,BOOK III.,Doom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch
2891,BOOK III.,"His loath'd existence through ten centuries,"
2892,BOOK III.,And then to die alone. Who can devise
2893,BOOK III.,A total opposition? No one. So
2894,BOOK III.,"One million times ocean must ebb and flow,"
2895,BOOK III.,"And he oppressed. Yet he shall not die,"
2896,BOOK III.,These things accomplish'd:--If he utterly_                    700
2897,BOOK III.,"_Scans all the depths of magic, and expounds"
2898,BOOK III.,"The meanings of all motions, shapes, and sounds;"
2899,BOOK III.,If he explores all forms and substances
2900,BOOK III.,Straight homeward to their symbol-essences;
2901,BOOK III.,"He shall not die. Moreover, and in chief,_"
2902,BOOK III.,_He must pursue this task of joy and grief
2903,BOOK III.,"Most piously;--all lovers tempest-tost,"
2904,BOOK III.,"And in the savage overwhelming lost,"
2905,BOOK III.,"He shall deposit side by side, until"
2906,BOOK III.,Time's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:_               710
2907,BOOK III.,"_Which done, and all these labours ripened,"
2908,BOOK III.,"A youth, by heavenly power lov'd and led,"
2909,BOOK III.,Shall stand before him; whom he shall direct
2910,BOOK III.,How to consummate all. The youth elect
2911,BOOK III.,"Must do the thing, or both will be destroy'd._""--"
2912,BOOK III.,
2913,BOOK III.,"""Then,"" cried the young Endymion, overjoy'd,"
2914,BOOK III.,"""We are twin brothers in this destiny!"
2915,BOOK III.,"Say, I intreat thee, what achievement high"
2916,BOOK III.,"Is, in this restless world, for me reserv'd."
2917,BOOK III.,"What! if from thee my wandering feet had swerv'd,             720"
2918,BOOK III.,"Had we both perish'd?""--""Look!"" the sage replied,"
2919,BOOK III.,"""Dost thou not mark a gleaming through the tide,"
2920,BOOK III.,Of divers brilliances? 'tis the edifice
2921,BOOK III.,"I told thee of, where lovely Scylla lies;"
2922,BOOK III.,And where I have enshrined piously
2923,BOOK III.,"All lovers, whom fell storms have doom'd to die"
2924,BOOK III.,"Throughout my bondage."" Thus discoursing, on"
2925,BOOK III.,They went till unobscur'd the porches shone;
2926,BOOK III.,"Which hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight."
2927,BOOK III.,Sure never since king Neptune held his state                  730
2928,BOOK III.,Was seen such wonder underneath the stars.
2929,BOOK III.,Turn to some level plain where haughty Mars
2930,BOOK III.,Has legion'd all his battle; and behold
2931,BOOK III.,"How every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold"
2932,BOOK III.,"His even breast: see, many steeled squares,"
2933,BOOK III.,And rigid ranks of iron--whence who dares
2934,BOOK III.,"One step? Imagine further, line by line,"
2935,BOOK III.,These warrior thousands on the field supine:--
2936,BOOK III.,"So in that crystal place, in silent rows,"
2937,BOOK III.,Poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.--                 740
2938,BOOK III.,"The stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd"
2939,BOOK III.,Such thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;
2940,BOOK III.,"Such ranges of white feet, and patient lips"
2941,BOOK III.,"All ruddy,--for here death no blossom nips."
2942,BOOK III.,He mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair
2943,BOOK III.,Put sleekly on one side with nicest care;
2944,BOOK III.,"And each one's gentle wrists, with reverence,"
2945,BOOK III.,Put cross-wise to its heart.
2946,BOOK III.,
2947,BOOK III.,"""Let us commence,"
2948,BOOK III.,"Whisper'd the guide, stuttering with joy, even now.""          750"
2949,BOOK III.,"He spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,"
2950,BOOK III.,"Began to tear his scroll in pieces small,"
2951,BOOK III.,Uttering the while some mumblings funeral.
2952,BOOK III.,He tore it into pieces small as snow
2953,BOOK III.,That drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;
2954,BOOK III.,"And having done it, took his dark blue cloak"
2955,BOOK III.,And bound it round Endymion: then struck
2956,BOOK III.,His wand against the empty air times nine.--
2957,BOOK III.,"""What more there is to do, young man, is thine:"
2958,BOOK III.,But first a little patience; first undo                       760
2959,BOOK III.,"This tangled thread, and wind it to a clue."
2960,BOOK III.,"Ah, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;"
2961,BOOK III.,"And shouldst thou break it--What, is it done so clean?"
2962,BOOK III.,"A power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!"
2963,BOOK III.,The spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.
2964,BOOK III.,"Here is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,"
2965,BOOK III.,Nor mark'd with any sign or charactery--
2966,BOOK III.,Canst thou read aught? O read for pity's sake!

2968,BOOK III.,"This wand against yon lyre on the pedestal.""                  770"
2969,BOOK III.,
2970,BOOK III.,'Twas done: and straight with sudden swell and fall
2971,BOOK III.,"Sweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd"
2972,BOOK III.,"A lullaby to silence.--""Youth! now strew"
2973,BOOK III.,"These minced leaves on me, and passing through"
2974,BOOK III.,"Those files of dead, scatter the same around,"
2975,BOOK III.,"And thou wilt see the issue.""--'Mid the sound"
2976,BOOK III.,"Of flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,"
2977,BOOK III.,"Endymion from Glaucus stood apart,"
2978,BOOK III.,And scatter'd in his face some fragments light.
2979,BOOK III.,How lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight              780
2980,BOOK III.,"Smiling beneath a coral diadem,"
2981,BOOK III.,"Out-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,"
2982,BOOK III.,"Appear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,"
2983,BOOK III.,"Kneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force"
2984,BOOK III.,"Press'd its cold hand, and wept,--and Scylla sigh'd!"
2985,BOOK III.,"Endymion, with quick hand, the charm applied--"
2986,BOOK III.,"The nymph arose: he left them to their joy,"
2987,BOOK III.,"And onward went upon his high employ,"
2988,BOOK III.,Showering those powerful fragments on the dead.
2989,BOOK III.,"And, as he pass'd, each lifted up its head,                   790"
2990,BOOK III.,As doth a flower at Apollo's touch.
2991,BOOK III.,Death felt it to his inwards: 'twas too much:
2992,BOOK III.,Death fell a weeping in his charnel-house.
2993,BOOK III.,"The Latmian persever'd along, and thus"
2994,BOOK III.,All were re-animated. There arose
2995,BOOK III.,"A noise of harmony, pulses and throes"
2996,BOOK III.,"Of gladness in the air--while many, who"
2997,BOOK III.,"Had died in mutual arms devout and true,"
2998,BOOK III.,Sprang to each other madly; and the rest
2999,BOOK III.,Felt a high certainty of being blest.                         800
3000,BOOK III.,They gaz'd upon Endymion. Enchantment
3001,BOOK III.,"Grew drunken, and would have its head and bent."
3002,BOOK III.,"Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,"
3003,BOOK III.,"Budded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers"
3004,BOOK III.,"Of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine."
3005,BOOK III.,The two deliverers tasted a pure wine
3006,BOOK III.,"Of happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out."
3007,BOOK III.,"Speechless they eyed each other, and about"
3008,BOOK III.,"The fair assembly wander'd to and fro,"
3009,BOOK III.,Distracted with the richest overflow                          810
3010,BOOK III.,Of joy that ever pour'd from heaven.
3011,BOOK III.,
3012,BOOK III.,"----""Away!"""
3013,BOOK III.,"Shouted the new born god; ""Follow, and pay"
3014,BOOK III.,"Our piety to Neptunus supreme!""--"
3015,BOOK III.,"Then Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,"
3016,BOOK III.,"They led on first, bent to her meek surprise,"
3017,BOOK III.,"Though portal columns of a giant size,"
3018,BOOK III.,"Into the vaulted, boundless emerald."
3019,BOOK III.,"Joyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,"
3020,BOOK III.,Down marble steps; pouring as easily                          820
3021,BOOK III.,"As hour-glass sand,--and fast, as you might see"
3022,BOOK III.,"Swallows obeying the south summer's call,"
3023,BOOK III.,Or swans upon a gentle waterfall.
3024,BOOK III.,
3025,BOOK III.,"Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,"
3026,BOOK III.,"Ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,"
3027,BOOK III.,"Just within ken, they saw descending thick"
3028,BOOK III.,Another multitude. Whereat more quick
3029,BOOK III.,"Moved either host. On a wide sand they met,"
3030,BOOK III.,And of those numbers every eye was wet;
3031,BOOK III.,"For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,              830"
3032,BOOK III.,Like what was never heard in all the throes
3033,BOOK III.,Of wind and waters: 'tis past human wit
3034,BOOK III.,To tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it.
3035,BOOK III.,
3036,BOOK III.,"This mighty consummation made, the host"
3037,BOOK III.,"Mov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost"
3038,BOOK III.,"Huge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,"
3039,BOOK III.,"And from the rear diminishing away,--"
3040,BOOK III.,"Till a faint dawn surpris'd them. Glaucus cried,"
3041,BOOK III.,"""Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!"
3042,BOOK III.,"God Neptune's palaces!"" With noise increas'd,                 840"
3043,BOOK III.,They shoulder'd on towards that brightening cast.
3044,BOOK III.,At every onward step proud domes arose
3045,BOOK III.,"In prospect,--diamond gleams, and golden glows"
3046,BOOK III.,Of amber 'gainst their faces levelling.
3047,BOOK III.,"Joyous, and many as the leaves in spring,"
3048,BOOK III.,Still onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd.
3049,BOOK III.,"Rich opal domes were seen, on high upheld"
3050,BOOK III.,"By jasper pillars, letting through their shafts"
3051,BOOK III.,A blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts
3052,BOOK III.,Each gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:                 850
3053,BOOK III.,"For what poor mortals fragment up, as mere"
3054,BOOK III.,"As marble was there lavish, to the vast"
3055,BOOK III.,"Of one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,"
3056,BOOK III.,"Even for common bulk, those olden three,"
3057,BOOK III.,"Memphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh."
3058,BOOK III.,
3059,BOOK III.,"As large, as bright, as colour'd as the bow"
3060,BOOK III.,"Of Iris, when unfading it doth shew"
3061,BOOK III.,"Beyond a silvery shower, was the arch"
3062,BOOK III.,"Through which this Paphian army took its march,"
3063,BOOK III.,Into the outer courts of Neptune's state:                     860
3064,BOOK III.,"Whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,"
3065,BOOK III.,To which the leaders sped; but not half raught
3066,BOOK III.,"Ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,"
3067,BOOK III.,And made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes
3068,BOOK III.,Like callow eagles at the first sunrise.
3069,BOOK III.,Soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze
3070,BOOK III.,"Ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,"
3071,BOOK III.,"And then, behold! large Neptune on his throne"
3072,BOOK III.,Of emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;
3073,BOOK III.,"At his right hand stood winged Love, and on                   870"
3074,BOOK III.,His left sat smiling Beauty's paragon.
3075,BOOK III.,
3076,BOOK III.,Far as the mariner on highest mast
3077,BOOK III.,"Can see all round upon the calmed vast,"
3078,BOOK III.,So wide was Neptune's hall: and as the blue
3079,BOOK III.,"Doth vault the waters, so the waters drew"
3080,BOOK III.,"Their doming curtains, high, magnificent,"
3081,BOOK III.,Aw'd from the throne aloof;--and when storm-rent
3082,BOOK III.,Disclos'd the thunder-gloomings in Jove's air;
3083,BOOK III.,"But sooth'd as now, flash'd sudden everywhere,"
3084,BOOK III.,"Noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering                   880"
3085,BOOK III.,Death to a human eye: for there did spring
3086,BOOK III.,"From natural west, and east, and south, and north,"
3087,BOOK III.,"A light as of four sunsets, blazing forth"
3088,BOOK III.,A gold-green zenith 'bove the Sea-God's head.
3089,BOOK III.,"Of lucid depth the floor, and far outspread"
3090,BOOK III.,"As breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe"
3091,BOOK III.,"Of feather'd Indian darts about, as through"
3092,BOOK III.,"The delicatest air: air verily,"
3093,BOOK III.,But for the portraiture of clouds and sky:
3094,BOOK III.,"This palace floor breath-air,--but for the amaze              890"
3095,BOOK III.,"Of deep-seen wonders motionless,--and blaze"
3096,BOOK III.,"Of the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,"
3097,BOOK III.,Globing a golden sphere.
3098,BOOK III.,
3099,BOOK III.,They stood in dreams
3100,BOOK III.,Till Triton blew his horn. The palace rang;
3101,BOOK III.,The Nereids danc'd; the Syrens faintly sang;
3102,BOOK III.,And the great Sea-King bow'd his dripping head.
3103,BOOK III.,"Then Love took wing, and from his pinions shed"
3104,BOOK III.,On all the multitude a nectarous dew.
3105,BOOK III.,The ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew                       900
3106,BOOK III.,Fair Scylla and her guides to conference;
3107,BOOK III.,And when they reach'd the throned eminence
3108,BOOK III.,"She kist the sea-nymph's cheek,--who sat her down"
3109,BOOK III.,"A toying with the doves. Then,--""Mighty crown"
3110,BOOK III.,"And sceptre of this kingdom!"" Venus said,"
3111,BOOK III.,"""Thy vows were on a time to Nais paid:"
3112,BOOK III.,"Behold!""--Two copious tear-drops instant fell"
3113,BOOK III.,"From the God's large eyes; he smil'd delectable,"
3114,BOOK III.,And over Glaucus held his blessing hands.--
3115,BOOK III.,"""Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands                   910"
3116,BOOK III.,Of love? Now this is cruel. Since the hour
3117,BOOK III.,"I met thee in earth's bosom, all my power"
3118,BOOK III.,"Have I put forth to serve thee. What, not yet"
3119,BOOK III.,Escap'd from dull mortality's harsh net?
3120,BOOK III.,"A little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,"
3121,BOOK III.,"Or I am skilless quite: an idle tongue,"
3122,BOOK III.,"A humid eye, and steps luxurious,"
3123,BOOK III.,"Where these are new and strange, are ominous."
3124,BOOK III.,"Aye, I have seen these signs in one of heaven,"
3125,BOOK III.,When others were all blind; and were I given                  920
3126,BOOK III.,"To utter secrets, haply I might say"
3127,BOOK III.,Some pleasant words:--but Love will have his day.
3128,BOOK III.,"So wait awhile expectant. Pr'ythee soon,"
3129,BOOK III.,"Even in the passing of thine honey-moon,"
3130,BOOK III.,Visit my Cytherea: thou wilt find
3131,BOOK III.,"Cupid well-natured, my Adonis kind;"
3132,BOOK III.,"And pray persuade with thee--Ah, I have done,"
3133,BOOK III.,"All blisses be upon thee, my sweet son!""--"
3134,BOOK III.,Thus the fair goddess: while Endymion
3135,BOOK III.,Knelt to receive those accents halcyon.                       930
3136,BOOK III.,
3137,BOOK III.,Meantime a glorious revelry began
3138,BOOK III.,Before the Water-Monarch. Nectar ran
3139,BOOK III.,In courteous fountains to all cups outreach'd;
3140,BOOK III.,"And plunder'd vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach'd"
3141,BOOK III.,New growth about each shell and pendent lyre;
3142,BOOK III.,"The which, in disentangling for their fire,"
3143,BOOK III.,Pull'd down fresh foliage and coverture
3144,BOOK III.,"For dainty toying. Cupid, empire-sure,"
3145,BOOK III.,"Flutter'd and laugh'd, and oft-times through the throng"
3146,BOOK III.,"Made a delighted way. Then dance, and song,                   940"
3147,BOOK III.,And garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd.
3148,BOOK III.,"In harmless tendril they each other chain'd,"
3149,BOOK III.,And strove who should be smother'd deepest in
3150,BOOK III.,Fresh crush of leaves.
3151,BOOK III.,
3152,BOOK III.,O 'tis a very sin
3153,BOOK III.,For one so weak to venture his poor verse
3154,BOOK III.,"In such a place as this. O do not curse,"
3155,BOOK III.,High Muses! let him hurry to the ending.
3156,BOOK III.,
3157,BOOK III.,All suddenly were silent. A soft blending
3158,BOOK III.,Of dulcet instruments came charmingly;                        950
3159,BOOK III.,And then a hymn.
3160,BOOK III.,
3161,BOOK III.,"""KING of the stormy sea!"
3162,BOOK III.,"Brother of Jove, and co-inheritor"
3163,BOOK III.,Of elements! Eternally before
3164,BOOK III.,"Thee the waves awful bow. Fast, stubborn rock,"
3165,BOOK III.,"At thy fear'd trident shrinking, doth unlock"
3166,BOOK III.,"Its deep foundations, hissing into foam."
3167,BOOK III.,"All mountain-rivers lost, in the wide home"
3168,BOOK III.,Of thy capacious bosom ever flow.
3169,BOOK III.,"Thou frownest, and old Eolus thy foe                          960"
3170,BOOK III.,"Skulks to his cavern, 'mid the gruff complaint"
3171,BOOK III.,Of all his rebel tempests. Dark clouds faint
3172,BOOK III.,"When, from thy diadem, a silver gleam"
3173,BOOK III.,Slants over blue dominion. Thy bright team
3174,BOOK III.,"Gulphs in the morning light, and scuds along"
3175,BOOK III.,To bring thee nearer to that golden song
3176,BOOK III.,"Apollo singeth, while his chariot"
3177,BOOK III.,Waits at the doors of heaven. Thou art not
3178,BOOK III.,For scenes like this: an empire stern hast thou;
3179,BOOK III.,"And it hath furrow'd that large front: yet now,               970"
3180,BOOK III.,"As newly come of heaven, dost thou sit"
3181,BOOK III.,To blend and interknit
3182,BOOK III.,Subdued majesty with this glad time.
3183,BOOK III.,O shell-borne King sublime!
3184,BOOK III.,We lay our hearts before thee evermore--
3185,BOOK III.,"We sing, and we adore!"
3186,BOOK III.,
3187,BOOK III.,"""Breathe softly, flutes;"
3188,BOOK III.,"Be tender of your strings, ye soothing lutes;"
3189,BOOK III.,"Nor be the trumpet heard! O vain, O vain;"
3190,BOOK III.,"Not flowers budding in an April rain,                         980"
3191,BOOK III.,"Nor breath of sleeping dove, nor river's flow,--"

3564,BOOK IV.,I've been a ranger
3565,BOOK IV.,In search of pleasure throughout every clime:
3566,BOOK IV.,"Alas, 'tis not for me!"
3567,BOOK IV.,"Bewitch'd I sure must be,"
3568,BOOK IV.,To lose in grieving all my maiden prime.                      280
3569,BOOK IV.,
3570,BOOK IV.,"""Come then, Sorrow!"
3571,BOOK IV.,Sweetest Sorrow!
3572,BOOK IV.,Like an own babe I nurse thee on my breast:
3573,BOOK IV.,I thought to leave thee
3574,BOOK IV.,"And deceive thee,"
3575,BOOK IV.,But now of all the world I love thee best.
3576,BOOK IV.,
3577,BOOK IV.,"""There is not one,"
3578,BOOK IV.,"No, no, not one"
3579,BOOK IV.,But thee to comfort a poor lonely maid;
3580,BOOK IV.,"Thou art her mother,                                    290"
3581,BOOK IV.,"And her brother,"
3582,BOOK IV.,"Her playmate, and her wooer in the shade."""
3583,BOOK IV.,
3584,BOOK IV.,"O what a sigh she gave in finishing,"
3585,BOOK IV.,"And look, quite dead to every worldly thing!"
3586,BOOK IV.,"Endymion could not speak, but gazed on her;"
3587,BOOK IV.,And listened to the wind that now did stir
3588,BOOK IV.,"About the crisped oaks full drearily,"
3589,BOOK IV.,Yet with as sweet a softness as might be
3590,BOOK IV.,Remember'd from its velvet summer song.
3591,BOOK IV.,"At last he said: ""Poor lady, how thus long                    300"
3592,BOOK IV.,Have I been able to endure that voice?
3593,BOOK IV.,Fair Melody! kind Syren! I've no choice;
3594,BOOK IV.,I must be thy sad servant evermore:
3595,BOOK IV.,I cannot choose but kneel here and adore.
3596,BOOK IV.,"Alas, I must not think--by Phoebe, no!"
3597,BOOK IV.,"Let me not think, soft Angel! shall it be so?"
3598,BOOK IV.,"Say, beautifullest, shall I never think?"
3599,BOOK IV.,O thou could'st foster me beyond the brink
3600,BOOK IV.,Of recollection! make my watchful care
3601,BOOK IV.,"Close up its bloodshot eyes, nor see despair!                 310"
3602,BOOK IV.,"Do gently murder half my soul, and I"
3603,BOOK IV.,Shall feel the other half so utterly!--
3604,BOOK IV.,I'm giddy at that cheek so fair and smooth;
3605,BOOK IV.,O let it blush so ever! let it soothe
3606,BOOK IV.,My madness! let it mantle rosy-warm
3607,BOOK IV.,"With the tinge of love, panting in safe alarm.--"
3608,BOOK IV.,"This cannot be thy hand, and yet it is;"
3609,BOOK IV.,And this is sure thine other softling--this
3610,BOOK IV.,"Thine own fair bosom, and I am so near!"
3611,BOOK IV.,Wilt fall asleep? O let me sip that tear!                     320
3612,BOOK IV.,And whisper one sweet word that I may know
3613,BOOK IV.,"This is this world--sweet dewy blossom!""--_Woe!"
3614,BOOK IV.,Woe! Woe to that Endymion! Where is he?_--
3615,BOOK IV.,Even these words went echoing dismally
3616,BOOK IV.,"Through the wide forest--a most fearful tone,"
3617,BOOK IV.,Like one repenting in his latest moan;
3618,BOOK IV.,"And while it died away a shade pass'd by,"
3619,BOOK IV.,As of a thunder cloud. When arrows fly
3620,BOOK IV.,"Through the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth"
3621,BOOK IV.,Their timid necks and tremble; so these both                  330
3622,BOOK IV.,"Leant to each other trembling, and sat so"
3623,BOOK IV.,"Waiting for some destruction--when lo,"
3624,BOOK IV.,Foot-feather'd Mercury appear'd sublime
3625,BOOK IV.,Beyond the tall tree tops; and in less time
3626,BOOK IV.,"Than shoots the slanted hail-storm, down he dropt"
3627,BOOK IV.,"Towards the ground; but rested not, nor stopt"
3628,BOOK IV.,One moment from his home: only the sward
3629,BOOK IV.,"He with his wand light touch'd, and heavenward"
3630,BOOK IV.,Swifter than sight was gone--even before
3631,BOOK IV.,The teeming earth a sudden witness bore                       340
3632,BOOK IV.,Of his swift magic. Diving swans appear
3633,BOOK IV.,Above the crystal circlings white and clear;
3634,BOOK IV.,"And catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,"
3635,BOOK IV.,How they can dive in sight and unseen rise--
3636,BOOK IV.,"So from the turf outsprang two steeds jet-black,"
3637,BOOK IV.,Each with large dark blue wings upon his back.
3638,BOOK IV.,The youth of Caria plac'd the lovely dame
3639,BOOK IV.,"On one, and felt himself in spleen to tame"
3640,BOOK IV.,"The other's fierceness. Through the air they flew,"
3641,BOOK IV.,High as the eagles. Like two drops of dew                     350
3642,BOOK IV.,"Exhal'd to Phoebus' lips, away they are gone,"
3643,BOOK IV.,"Far from the earth away--unseen, alone,"
3644,BOOK IV.,"Among cool clouds and winds, but that the free,"
3645,BOOK IV.,The buoyant life of song can floating be
3646,BOOK IV.,"Above their heads, and follow them untir'd.--"
3647,BOOK IV.,"Muse of my native land, am I inspir'd?"
3648,BOOK IV.,"This is the giddy air, and I must spread"
3649,BOOK IV.,Wide pinions to keep here; nor do I dread
3650,BOOK IV.,"Or height, or depth, or width, or any chance"
3651,BOOK IV.,Precipitous: I have beneath my glance                         360
3652,BOOK IV.,Those towering horses and their mournful freight.
3653,BOOK IV.,"Could I thus sail, and see, and thus await"
3654,BOOK IV.,"Fearless for power of thought, without thine aid?--"
3655,BOOK IV.,"There is a sleepy dusk, an odorous shade"
3656,BOOK IV.,"From some approaching wonder, and behold"
3657,BOOK IV.,"Those winged steeds, with snorting nostrils bold"
3658,BOOK IV.,"Snuff at its faint extreme, and seem to tire,"
3659,BOOK IV.,Dying to embers from their native fire!
3660,BOOK IV.,
3661,BOOK IV.,"There curl'd a purple mist around them; soon,"
3662,BOOK IV.,It seem'd as when around the pale new moon                    370
3663,BOOK IV.,Sad Zephyr droops the clouds like weeping willow:
3664,BOOK IV.,'Twas Sleep slow journeying with head on pillow.
3665,BOOK IV.,"For the first time, since he came nigh dead born"
3666,BOOK IV.,"From the old womb of night, his cave forlorn"
3667,BOOK IV.,"Had he left more forlorn; for the first time,"
3668,BOOK IV.,He felt aloof the day and morning's prime--
3669,BOOK IV.,Because into his depth Cimmerian
3670,BOOK IV.,"There came a dream, shewing how a young man,"
3671,BOOK IV.,"Ere a lean bat could plump its wintery skin,"
3672,BOOK IV.,Would at high Jove's empyreal footstool win                   380
3673,BOOK IV.,"An immortality, and how espouse"
3674,BOOK IV.,"Jove's daughter, and be reckon'd of his house."
3675,BOOK IV.,"Now was he slumbering towards heaven's gate,"
3676,BOOK IV.,That he might at the threshold one hour wait
3677,BOOK IV.,"To hear the marriage melodies, and then"
3678,BOOK IV.,Sink downward to his dusky cave again.
3679,BOOK IV.,"His litter of smooth semilucent mist,"
3680,BOOK IV.,"Diversely ting'd with rose and amethyst,"
3681,BOOK IV.,Puzzled those eyes that for the centre sought;
3682,BOOK IV.,And scarcely for one moment could be caught                   390
3683,BOOK IV.,His sluggish form reposing motionless.
3684,BOOK IV.,"Those two on winged steeds, with all the stress"
3685,BOOK IV.,"Of vision search'd for him, as one would look"
3686,BOOK IV.,Athwart the sallows of a river nook
3687,BOOK IV.,"To catch a glance at silver throated eels,--"
3688,BOOK IV.,"Or from old Skiddaw's top, when fog conceals"
3689,BOOK IV.,"His rugged forehead in a mantle pale,"
3690,BOOK IV.,With an eye-guess towards some pleasant vale
3691,BOOK IV.,Descry a favourite hamlet faint and far.
3692,BOOK IV.,
3693,BOOK IV.,"These raven horses, though they foster'd are                400"
3694,BOOK IV.,"Of earth's splenetic fire, dully drop"
3695,BOOK IV.,"Their full-veined ears, nostrils blood wide, and stop;"
3696,BOOK IV.,Upon the spiritless mist have they outspread
3697,BOOK IV.,"Their ample feathers, are in slumber dead,--"
3698,BOOK IV.,"And on those pinions, level in mid air,"
3699,BOOK IV.,Endymion sleepeth and the lady fair.
3700,BOOK IV.,"Slowly they sail, slowly as icy isle"
3701,BOOK IV.,Upon a calm sea drifting: and meanwhile
3702,BOOK IV.,The mournful wanderer dreams. Behold! he walks
3703,BOOK IV.,On heaven's pavement; brotherly he talks                      410
3704,BOOK IV.,To divine powers: from his hand full fain
3705,BOOK IV.,Juno's proud birds are pecking pearly grain:
3706,BOOK IV.,"He tries the nerve of Phoebus' golden bow,"
3707,BOOK IV.,And asketh where the golden apples grow:
3708,BOOK IV.,"Upon his arm he braces Pallas' shield,"
3709,BOOK IV.,And strives in vain to unsettle and wield
3710,BOOK IV.,A Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings
3711,BOOK IV.,"A full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings"
3712,BOOK IV.,"And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,"
3713,BOOK IV.,"And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,                    420"
3714,BOOK IV.,Touching with dazzled lips her starlight hand.
3715,BOOK IV.,"He blows a bugle,--an ethereal band"
3716,BOOK IV.,"Are visible above: the Seasons four,--"
3717,BOOK IV.,"Green-kyrtled Spring, flush Summer, golden store"
3718,BOOK IV.,"In Autumn's sickle, Winter frosty hoar,"
3719,BOOK IV.,"Join dance with shadowy Hours; while still the blast,"
3720,BOOK IV.,"In swells unmitigated, still doth last"
3721,BOOK IV.,"To sway their floating morris. ""Whose is this?"
3722,BOOK IV.,"Whose bugle?"" he inquires: they smile--""O Dis!"
3723,BOOK IV.,Why is this mortal here? Dost thou not know                   430
3724,BOOK IV.,Its mistress' lips? Not thou?--'Tis Dian's: lo!
3725,BOOK IV.,"She rises crescented!"" He looks, 'tis she,"
3726,BOOK IV.,"His very goddess: good-bye earth, and sea,"
3727,BOOK IV.,"And air, and pains, and care, and suffering;"
3728,BOOK IV.,Good-bye to all but love! Then doth he spring
3729,BOOK IV.,"Towards her, and awakes--and, strange, o'erhead,"
3730,BOOK IV.,"Of those same fragrant exhalations bred,"
3731,BOOK IV.,Beheld awake his very dream: the gods
3732,BOOK IV.,Stood smiling; merry Hebe laughs and nods;
3733,BOOK IV.,And Phoebe bends towards him crescented.                       440
3734,BOOK IV.,"O state perplexing! On the pinion bed,"
3735,BOOK IV.,"Too well awake, he feels the panting side"
3736,BOOK IV.,Of his delicious lady. He who died
3737,BOOK IV.,"For soaring too audacious in the sun,"
3738,BOOK IV.,"Where that same treacherous wax began to run,"
3739,BOOK IV.,Felt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.
3740,BOOK IV.,"His heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,"
3741,BOOK IV.,To that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way--
3742,BOOK IV.,"Ah, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!"
3743,BOOK IV.,"So fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,                     450"
3744,BOOK IV.,He could not help but kiss her: then he grew
3745,BOOK IV.,Awhile forgetful of all beauty save
3746,BOOK IV.,"Young Phoebe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave"
3747,BOOK IV.,Forgiveness: yet he turn'd once more to look
3748,BOOK IV.,"At the sweet sleeper,--all his soul was shook,--"
3749,BOOK IV.,She press'd his hand in slumber; so once more
3750,BOOK IV.,He could not help but kiss her and adore.
3751,BOOK IV.,"At this the shadow wept, melting away."
3752,BOOK IV.,"The Latmian started up: ""Bright goddess, stay!"
3753,BOOK IV.,"Search my most hidden breast! By truth's own tongue,"
3754,BOOK IV.,I have no dædale heart: why is it wrung                       461
3755,BOOK IV.,"To desperation? Is there nought for me,"
3756,BOOK IV.,"Upon the bourne of bliss, but misery?"""
3757,BOOK IV.,
3758,BOOK IV.,These words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:
3759,BOOK IV.,Her dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses
3760,BOOK IV.,With 'haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.
3761,BOOK IV.,"""Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe"
3762,BOOK IV.,This murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st
3763,BOOK IV.,"Pillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st"
3764,BOOK IV.,What horrors may discomfort thee and me.                      470
3765,BOOK IV.,"Ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!--"
3766,BOOK IV.,Yet did she merely weep--her gentle soul
3767,BOOK IV.,Hath no revenge in it: as it is whole
3768,BOOK IV.,"In tenderness, would I were whole in love!"
3769,BOOK IV.,"Can I prize thee, fair maid, till price above,"
3770,BOOK IV.,Even when I feel as true as innocence?
3771,BOOK IV.,"I do, I do.--What is this soul then? Whence"
3772,BOOK IV.,"Came it? It does not seem my own, and I"
3773,BOOK IV.,Have no self-passion or identity.
3774,BOOK IV.,"Some fearful end must be: where, where is it?                 480"
3775,BOOK IV.,"By Nemesis, I see my spirit flit"
3776,BOOK IV.,"Alone about the dark--Forgive me, sweet:"
3777,BOOK IV.,"Shall we away?"" He rous'd the steeds: they beat"
3778,BOOK IV.,"Their wings chivalrous into the clear air,"
3779,BOOK IV.,Leaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.
3780,BOOK IV.,
3781,BOOK IV.,"The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,"
3782,BOOK IV.,"And Vesper, risen star, began to throe"
3783,BOOK IV.,"In the dusk heavens silvery, when they"
3784,BOOK IV.,Thus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.
3785,BOOK IV.,Nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange--              490
3786,BOOK IV.,"Eternal oaths and vows they interchange,"
3787,BOOK IV.,"In such wise, in such temper, so aloof"
3788,BOOK IV.,"Up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,"
3789,BOOK IV.,"So witless of their doom, that verily"
3790,BOOK IV.,'Tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;
3791,BOOK IV.,"Whether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd--"
3792,BOOK IV.,"Most like with joy gone mad, with sorrow cloy'd."
3793,BOOK IV.,
3794,BOOK IV.,"Fell facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,"
3795,BOOK IV.,"The moon put forth a little diamond peak,"
3796,BOOK IV.,"No bigger than an unobserved star,                            500"
3797,BOOK IV.,Or tiny point of fairy scymetar;
3798,BOOK IV.,Bright signal that she only stoop'd to tie
3799,BOOK IV.,"Her silver sandals, ere deliciously"
3800,BOOK IV.,She bow'd into the heavens her timid head.
3801,BOOK IV.,"Slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,"
3802,BOOK IV.,"While to his lady meek the Carian turn'd,"
3803,BOOK IV.,To mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd
3804,BOOK IV.,This beauty in its birth--Despair! despair!
3805,BOOK IV.,He saw her body fading gaunt and spare
3806,BOOK IV.,In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist;
3807,BOOK IV.,"It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,                 511"
3808,BOOK IV.,"And, horror! kiss'd his own--he was alone."
3809,BOOK IV.,"Her steed a little higher soar'd, and then"
3810,BOOK IV.,Dropt hawkwise to the earth.
3811,BOOK IV.,
3812,BOOK IV.,"There lies a den,"
3813,BOOK IV.,Beyond the seeming confines of the space
3814,BOOK IV.,Made for the soul to wander in and trace
3815,BOOK IV.,"Its own existence, of remotest glooms."
3816,BOOK IV.,"Dark regions are around it, where the tombs"
3817,BOOK IV.,"Of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce                  520"
3818,BOOK IV.,"One hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce"
3819,BOOK IV.,Of new-born woe it feels more inly smart:
3820,BOOK IV.,And in these regions many a venom'd dart
3821,BOOK IV.,At random flies; they are the proper home
3822,BOOK IV.,Of every ill: the man is yet to come
3823,BOOK IV.,Who hath not journeyed in this native hell.
3824,BOOK IV.,But few have ever felt how calm and well
3825,BOOK IV.,Sleep may be had in that deep den of all.
3826,BOOK IV.,There anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:
3827,BOOK IV.,"Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,                         530"
3828,BOOK IV.,Yet all is still within and desolate.
3829,BOOK IV.,"Beset with plainful gusts, within ye hear"
3830,BOOK IV.,No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier
3831,BOOK IV.,The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none
3832,BOOK IV.,Who strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.
3833,BOOK IV.,"Just when the sufferer begins to burn,"
3834,BOOK IV.,"Then it is free to him; and from an urn,"
3835,BOOK IV.,"Still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught--"
3836,BOOK IV.,Young Semele such richness never quaft
3837,BOOK IV.,In her maternal longing. Happy gloom!                         540
3838,BOOK IV.,Dark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom
3839,BOOK IV.,Of health by due; where silence dreariest
3840,BOOK IV.,Is most articulate; where hopes infest;
3841,BOOK IV.,Where those eyes are the brightest far that keep
3842,BOOK IV.,Their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.
3843,BOOK IV.,O happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!
3844,BOOK IV.,Pregnant with such a den to save the whole
3845,BOOK IV.,"In thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!"
3846,BOOK IV.,"For, never since thy griefs and woes began,"
3847,BOOK IV.,Hast thou felt so content: a grievous feud                    550
3848,BOOK IV.,Hath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.
3849,BOOK IV.,"Aye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne"
3850,BOOK IV.,With dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn
3851,BOOK IV.,Because he knew not whither he was going.
3852,BOOK IV.,"So happy was he, not the aerial blowing"
3853,BOOK IV.,Of trumpets at clear parley from the east
3854,BOOK IV.,"Could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast."
3855,BOOK IV.,They stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm
3856,BOOK IV.,"He flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm"
3857,BOOK IV.,"Could lift Endymion's head, or he had view'd                  560"
3858,BOOK IV.,"A skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,--"
3859,BOOK IV.,And silvery was its passing: voices sweet
3860,BOOK IV.,Warbling the while as if to lull and greet
3861,BOOK IV.,"The wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,"
3862,BOOK IV.,While past the vision went in bright array.

4258,BOOK IV.,"We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,"
4259,BOOK IV.,What is there to plain of? By Titan's foe
4260,BOOK IV.,"I am but rightly serv'd."" So saying, he"
4261,BOOK IV.,"Tripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;"
4262,BOOK IV.,"Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,"
4263,BOOK IV.,As though they jests had been: nor had he done
4264,BOOK IV.,"His laugh at nature's holy countenance,"
4265,BOOK IV.,"Until that grove appear'd, as if perchance,"
4266,BOOK IV.,And then his tongue with sober seemlihed
4267,BOOK IV.,"Gave utterance as he entered: ""Ha!"" I said,                   960"
4268,BOOK IV.,"""King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,"
4269,BOOK IV.,"And by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,"
4270,BOOK IV.,"This dusk religion, pomp of solitude,"
4271,BOOK IV.,"And the Promethean clay by thief endued,"
4272,BOOK IV.,"By old Saturnus' forelock, by his head"
4273,BOOK IV.,"Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed"
4274,BOOK IV.,Myself to things of light from infancy;
4275,BOOK IV.,"And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,"
4276,BOOK IV.,Is sure enough to make a mortal man
4277,BOOK IV.,"Grow impious."" So he inwardly began                           970"
4278,BOOK IV.,On things for which no wording can be found;
4279,BOOK IV.,"Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd"
4280,BOOK IV.,Beyond the reach of music: for the choir
4281,BOOK IV.,"Of Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar"
4282,BOOK IV.,Nor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull
4283,BOOK IV.,"The vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,"
4284,BOOK IV.,Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.
4285,BOOK IV.,"He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,"
4286,BOOK IV.,Wan as primroses gather'd at midnight
4287,BOOK IV.,"By chilly finger'd spring. ""Unhappy wight!                    980"
4288,BOOK IV.,"Endymion!"" said Peona, ""we are here!"
4289,BOOK IV.,"What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?"""
4290,BOOK IV.,"Then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand"
4291,BOOK IV.,"Press'd, saying: ""Sister, I would have command,"
4292,BOOK IV.,"If it were heaven's will, on our sad fate."""
4293,BOOK IV.,At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate
4294,BOOK IV.,"And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,"
4295,BOOK IV.,"To Endymion's amaze: ""By Cupid's dove,"
4296,BOOK IV.,And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth
4297,BOOK IV.,"Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!""                  990"
4298,BOOK IV.,"And as she spake, into her face there came"
4299,BOOK IV.,"Light, as reflected from a silver flame:"
4300,BOOK IV.,"Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display"
4301,BOOK IV.,Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day
4302,BOOK IV.,"Dawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld"
4303,BOOK IV.,"Phoebe, his passion! joyous she upheld"
4304,BOOK IV.,"Her lucid bow, continuing thus: ""Drear, drear"
4305,BOOK IV.,Has our delaying been; but foolish fear
4306,BOOK IV.,Withheld me first; and then decrees of fate;
4307,BOOK IV.,And then 'twas fit that from this mortal state               1000
4308,BOOK IV.,"Thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change"
4309,BOOK IV.,"Be spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range"
4310,BOOK IV.,"These forests, and to thee they safe shall be"
4311,BOOK IV.,As was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee
4312,BOOK IV.,"To meet us many a time."" Next Cynthia bright"
4313,BOOK IV.,"Peona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night:"
4314,BOOK IV.,"Her brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown"
4315,BOOK IV.,"Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon."
4316,BOOK IV.,"She gave her fair hands to him, and behold,"
4317,BOOK IV.,"Before three swiftest kisses he had told,                    1010"
4318,BOOK IV.,They vanish'd far away!--Peona went
4319,BOOK IV.,Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment.
