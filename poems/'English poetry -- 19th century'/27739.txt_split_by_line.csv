678,MYCERINUS[2],"And turning, left them there; and with brief pause,"
679,MYCERINUS[2],"Girt with a throng of revellers, bent his way"
680,MYCERINUS[2],To the cool region of the groves he loved.
681,MYCERINUS[2],"There by the river-banks he wander'd on,"
682,MYCERINUS[2],"From palm-grove on to palm-grove, happy trees,"
683,MYCERINUS[2],"Their smooth tops shining sunward, and beneath"
684,MYCERINUS[2],Burying their unsunn'd stems in grass and flowers;
685,MYCERINUS[2],Where in one dream the feverish time of youth
686,MYCERINUS[2],"Might fade in slumber, and the feet of joy"
687,MYCERINUS[2],Might wander all day long and never tire.
688,MYCERINUS[2],"Here came the king, holding high feast, at morn,"
689,MYCERINUS[2],"Rose-crown'd; and ever, when the sun went down,"
690,MYCERINUS[2],"A hundred lamps beam'd in the tranquil gloom,"
691,MYCERINUS[2],"From tree to tree all through the twinkling grove,"
692,MYCERINUS[2],Revealing all the tumult of the feast--
693,MYCERINUS[2],"Flush'd guests, and golden goblets foam'd with wine;"
694,MYCERINUS[2],While the deep-burnish'd foliage overhead
695,MYCERINUS[2],Splinter'd the silver arrows of the moon.
696,MYCERINUS[2],It may be that sometimes his wondering soul
697,MYCERINUS[2],From the loud joyful laughter of his lips
698,MYCERINUS[2],"Might shrink half startled, like a guilty man"
699,MYCERINUS[2],Who wrestles with his dream; as some pale shape
700,MYCERINUS[2],"Gliding half hidden through the dusky stems,"
701,MYCERINUS[2],"Would thrust a hand before the lifted bowl,"
702,MYCERINUS[2],"Whispering: _A little space, and thou art mine!_"
703,MYCERINUS[2],It may be on that joyless feast his eye
704,MYCERINUS[2],"Dwelt with mere outward seeming; he, within,"
705,MYCERINUS[2],"Took measure of his soul, and knew its strength,"
706,MYCERINUS[2],"And by that silent knowledge, day by day,"
707,MYCERINUS[2],"Was calm'd, ennobled, comforted, sustain'd."
708,MYCERINUS[2],"It may be; but not less his brow was smooth,"
709,MYCERINUS[2],"And his clear laugh fled ringing through the gloom,"
710,MYCERINUS[2],And his mirth quail'd not at the mild reproof
711,MYCERINUS[2],Sigh'd out by winter's sad tranquillity;
712,MYCERINUS[2],"Nor, pall'd with its own fulness, ebb'd and died"
713,MYCERINUS[2],In the rich languor of long summer-days;
714,MYCERINUS[2],"Nor wither'd when the palm-tree plumes, that roof'd"
715,MYCERINUS[2],"With their mild dark his grassy banquet-hall,"
716,MYCERINUS[2],Bent to the cold winds of the showerless spring;
717,MYCERINUS[2],"No, nor grew dark when autumn brought the clouds."
718,MYCERINUS[2],"So six long years he revell'd, night and day."
719,MYCERINUS[2],"And when the mirth wax'd loudest, with dull sound"
720,MYCERINUS[2],"Sometimes from the grove's centre echoes came,"
721,MYCERINUS[2],To tell his wondering people of their king;
722,MYCERINUS[2],"In the still night, across the steaming flats,"
723,MYCERINUS[2],Mix'd with the murmur of the moving Nile.

922,II,Round the tomb to stray;

954,III,"Prophets, transfigured Saints, and Martyrs brave,"
955,III,In the vast western window of the nave;
956,III,And on the pavement round the Tomb there glints
957,III,"A chequer-work of glowing sapphire-tints,"
958,III,"And amethyst, and ruby--then unclose"
959,III,"Your eyelids on the stone where ye repose,"
960,III,"And from your broider'd pillows lift your heads,"

968,III,"On the smooth leaden roof, and on the walls"
969,III,Shedding her pensive light at intervals
970,III,"The moon through the clere-story windows shines,"
971,III,And the wind washes through the mountain-pines.
972,III,"Then, gazing up 'mid the dim pillars high,"
973,III,"The foliaged marble forest where ye lie,"
974,III,"_Hush_, ye will say, _it is eternity!_"
975,III,"_This is the glimmering verge of Heaven, and these_"
976,III,_The columns of the heavenly palaces!_
977,III,"And, in the sweeping of the wind, your ear"

1125,A MEMORY-PICTURE,"Her soft face, her hair around;"
1126,A MEMORY-PICTURE,Tied under the archest chin
1127,A MEMORY-PICTURE,Mockery ever ambush'd in.

1174,A DREAM,
1175,A DREAM,"Was it a dream? We sail'd, I thought we sail'd,"
1176,A DREAM,"Martin and I, down a green Alpine stream,"
1177,A DREAM,"Border'd, each bank, with pines; the morning sun,"
1178,A DREAM,"On the wet umbrage of their glossy tops,"
1179,A DREAM,"On the red pinings of their forest-floor,"
1180,A DREAM,Drew a warm scent abroad; behind the pines
1181,A DREAM,"The mountain-skirts, with all their sylvan change"
1182,A DREAM,Of bright-leaf'd chestnuts and moss'd walnut-trees
1183,A DREAM,"And the frail scarlet-berried ash, began."
1184,A DREAM,"Swiss chalets glitter'd on the dewy slopes,"
1185,A DREAM,"And from some swarded shelf, high up, there came"
1186,A DREAM,Notes of wild pastoral music--over all
1187,A DREAM,"Ranged, diamond-bright, the eternal wall of snow."
1188,A DREAM,"Upon the mossy rocks at the stream's edge,"
1189,A DREAM,"Back'd by the pines, a plank-built cottage stood,"
1190,A DREAM,Bright in the sun; the climbing gourd-plant's leaves
1191,A DREAM,"Muffled its walls, and on the stone-strewn roof"
1192,A DREAM,"Lay the warm golden gourds; golden, within,"
1193,A DREAM,"Under the eaves, peer'd rows of Indian corn."
1194,A DREAM,We shot beneath the cottage with the stream.
1195,A DREAM,"On the brown, rude-carved balcony, two forms"
1196,A DREAM,"Came forth--Olivia's, Marguerite! and thine."
1197,A DREAM,"Clad were they both in white, flowers in their breast;"
1198,A DREAM,"Straw hats bedeck'd their heads, with ribbons blue,"
1199,A DREAM,"Which danced, and on their shoulders, fluttering, play'd."
1200,A DREAM,"They saw us, they conferr'd; their bosoms heaved,"
1201,A DREAM,And more than mortal impulse fill'd their eyes.
1202,A DREAM,"Their lips moved; their white arms, waved eagerly,"
1203,A DREAM,"Flash'd once, like falling streams; we rose, we gazed."
1204,A DREAM,"One moment, on the rapid's top, our boat"
1205,A DREAM,Hung poised--and then the darting river of Life
1206,A DREAM,"(Such now, methought, it was), the river of Life,"
1207,A DREAM,"Loud thundering, bore us by; swift, swift it foam'd,"
1208,A DREAM,"Black under cliffs it raced, round headlands shone."
1209,A DREAM,Soon the plank'd cottage by the sun-warm'd pines
1210,A DREAM,"Faded--the moss--the rocks; us burning plains,"
1211,A DREAM,"Bristled with cities, us the sea received."

1219,THE NEW SIRENS,"In the cedarn shadow sleeping,"
1220,THE NEW SIRENS,Where cool grass and fragrant glooms
1221,THE NEW SIRENS,"Forth at noon had lured me, creeping"
1222,THE NEW SIRENS,From your darken'd palace rooms--
1223,THE NEW SIRENS,"I, who in your train at morning"
1224,THE NEW SIRENS,"Stroll'd and sang with joyful mind,"
1225,THE NEW SIRENS,"Heard, in slumber, sounds of warning;"
1226,THE NEW SIRENS,Heard the hoarse boughs labour in the wind.
1227,THE NEW SIRENS,
1228,THE NEW SIRENS,"Who are they, O pensive Graces,"
1229,THE NEW SIRENS,--For I dream'd they wore your forms--
1230,THE NEW SIRENS,Who on shores and sea-wash'd places
1231,THE NEW SIRENS,Scoop the shelves and fret the storms?
1232,THE NEW SIRENS,"Who, when ships are that way tending,"
1233,THE NEW SIRENS,"Troop across the flushing sands,"
1234,THE NEW SIRENS,"To all reefs and narrows wending,"
1235,THE NEW SIRENS,"With blown tresses, and with beckoning hands?"
1236,THE NEW SIRENS,
1237,THE NEW SIRENS,"Yet I see, the howling levels"
1238,THE NEW SIRENS,Of the deep are not your lair;
1239,THE NEW SIRENS,And your tragic-vaunted revels
1240,THE NEW SIRENS,Are less lonely than they were.
1241,THE NEW SIRENS,Like those Kings with treasure steering
1242,THE NEW SIRENS,"From the jewell'd lands of dawn,"
1243,THE NEW SIRENS,"Troops, with gold and gifts, appearing,"
1244,THE NEW SIRENS,Stream all day through your enchanted lawn.
1245,THE NEW SIRENS,
1246,THE NEW SIRENS,"And we too, from upland valleys,"
1247,THE NEW SIRENS,Where some Muse with half-curved frown
1248,THE NEW SIRENS,Leans her ear to your mad sallies
1249,THE NEW SIRENS,Which the charm'd winds never drown;
1250,THE NEW SIRENS,"By faint music guided, ranging"
1251,THE NEW SIRENS,"The scared glens, we wander'd on,"
1252,THE NEW SIRENS,"Left our awful laurels hanging,"
1253,THE NEW SIRENS,And came heap'd with myrtles to your throne.
1254,THE NEW SIRENS,
1255,THE NEW SIRENS,From the dragon-warder'd fountains
1256,THE NEW SIRENS,"Where the springs of knowledge are,"
1257,THE NEW SIRENS,"From the watchers on the mountains,"
1258,THE NEW SIRENS,And the bright and morning star;
1259,THE NEW SIRENS,"We are exiles, we are falling,"
1260,THE NEW SIRENS,We have lost them at your call--
1261,THE NEW SIRENS,"O ye false ones, at your calling"
1262,THE NEW SIRENS,Seeking ceiled chambers and a palace-hall!
1263,THE NEW SIRENS,
1264,THE NEW SIRENS,Are the accents of your luring
1265,THE NEW SIRENS,More melodious than of yore?
1266,THE NEW SIRENS,Are those frail forms more enduring
1267,THE NEW SIRENS,Than the charms Ulysses bore?
1268,THE NEW SIRENS,"That we sought you with rejoicings,"
1269,THE NEW SIRENS,Till at evening we descry
1270,THE NEW SIRENS,At a pause of Siren voicings
1271,THE NEW SIRENS,These vext branches and this howling sky?...
1272,THE NEW SIRENS,
1273,THE NEW SIRENS,*       *       *       *       *
1274,THE NEW SIRENS,
1275,THE NEW SIRENS,"Oh, your pardon! The uncouthness"
1276,THE NEW SIRENS,"Of that primal age is gone,"
1277,THE NEW SIRENS,And the skin of dazzling smoothness
1278,THE NEW SIRENS,Screens not now a heart of stone.
1279,THE NEW SIRENS,Love has flush'd those cruel faces;
1280,THE NEW SIRENS,And those slacken'd arms forgo
1281,THE NEW SIRENS,"The delight of death-embraces,"
1282,THE NEW SIRENS,And yon whitening bone-mounds do not grow.
1283,THE NEW SIRENS,
1284,THE NEW SIRENS,"""Ah,"" you say; ""the large appearance"

1291,THE NEW SIRENS,"Loftier bearing, and a prouder eye."
1292,THE NEW SIRENS,
1293,THE NEW SIRENS,"""Come,"" you say, ""the hours were dreary;"
1294,THE NEW SIRENS,Dull did life in torpor fade;
1295,THE NEW SIRENS,"Time is lame, and we grew weary"
1296,THE NEW SIRENS,In the slumbrous cedarn shade.
1297,THE NEW SIRENS,"Round our hearts with long caresses,"
1298,THE NEW SIRENS,"With low sighings, Silence stole,"
1299,THE NEW SIRENS,And her load of steaming tresses
1300,THE NEW SIRENS,"Fell, like Ossa, on the climbing soul."

1306,THE NEW SIRENS,"Come,"" you say, ""the brain is seeking,"
1307,THE NEW SIRENS,While the sovran heart is dead;
1308,THE NEW SIRENS,"Yet this glean'd, when Gods were speaking,"
1309,THE NEW SIRENS,Rarer secrets than the toiling head.

1311,THE NEW SIRENS,"""Come,"" you say, ""opinion trembles,"

1314,THE NEW SIRENS,"Only, what we feel, we know."
1315,THE NEW SIRENS,Hath your wisdom felt emotions?
1316,THE NEW SIRENS,Will it weep our burning tears?
1317,THE NEW SIRENS,Hath it drunk of our love-potions
1318,THE NEW SIRENS,"Crowning moments with the wealth of years?"""
1319,THE NEW SIRENS,
1320,THE NEW SIRENS,"--I am dumb. Alas, too soon all"
1321,THE NEW SIRENS,Man's grave reasons disappear!
1322,THE NEW SIRENS,"Yet, I think, at God's tribunal"
1323,THE NEW SIRENS,Some large answer you shall hear.
1324,THE NEW SIRENS,"But, for me, my thoughts are straying"
1325,THE NEW SIRENS,"Where at sunrise, through your vines,"
1326,THE NEW SIRENS,"On these lawns I saw you playing,"
1327,THE NEW SIRENS,Hanging garlands on your odorous pines;
1328,THE NEW SIRENS,"When your showering locks enwound you,"
1329,THE NEW SIRENS,And your heavenly eyes shone through;
1330,THE NEW SIRENS,"When the pine-boughs yielded round you,"
1331,THE NEW SIRENS,And your brows were starr'd with dew;
1332,THE NEW SIRENS,"And immortal forms, to meet you,"
1333,THE NEW SIRENS,"Down the statued alleys came,"
1334,THE NEW SIRENS,"And through golden horns, to greet you,"
1335,THE NEW SIRENS,Blew such music as a God may frame.
1336,THE NEW SIRENS,
1337,THE NEW SIRENS,"Yes, I muse! And if the dawning"
1338,THE NEW SIRENS,"Into daylight never grew,"
1339,THE NEW SIRENS,If the glistering wings of morning
1340,THE NEW SIRENS,"On the dry noon shook their dew,"
1341,THE NEW SIRENS,"If the fits of joy were longer,"
1342,THE NEW SIRENS,"Or the day were sooner done,"
1343,THE NEW SIRENS,"Or, perhaps, if hope were stronger,"
1344,THE NEW SIRENS,No weak nursling of an earthly sun ...
1345,THE NEW SIRENS,"Pluck, pluck cypress, O pale maidens,"
1346,THE NEW SIRENS,Dusk the hall with yew!
1347,THE NEW SIRENS,

1349,THE NEW SIRENS,
1350,THE NEW SIRENS,"For a bound was set to meetings,"
1351,THE NEW SIRENS,And the sombre day dragg'd on;
1352,THE NEW SIRENS,"And the burst of joyful greetings,"
1353,THE NEW SIRENS,"And the joyful dawn, were gone."
1354,THE NEW SIRENS,"For the eye grows fill'd with gazing,"
1355,THE NEW SIRENS,And on raptures follow calms;
1356,THE NEW SIRENS,"And those warm locks men were praising,"
1357,THE NEW SIRENS,"Droop'd, unbraided, on your listless arms."
1358,THE NEW SIRENS,
1359,THE NEW SIRENS,"Storms unsmooth'd your folded valleys,"
1360,THE NEW SIRENS,And made all your cedars frown;
1361,THE NEW SIRENS,Leaves were whirling in the alleys
1362,THE NEW SIRENS,Which your lovers wander'd down.
1363,THE NEW SIRENS,"--Sitting cheerless in your bowers,"
1364,THE NEW SIRENS,"The hands propping the sunk head,"
1365,THE NEW SIRENS,"Still they gall you, the long hours,"
1366,THE NEW SIRENS,"And the hungry thought, that must be fed!"
1367,THE NEW SIRENS,
1368,THE NEW SIRENS,Is the pleasure that is tasted
1369,THE NEW SIRENS,Patient of a long review?
1370,THE NEW SIRENS,"Will the fire joy hath wasted,"
1371,THE NEW SIRENS,"Mused on, warm the heart anew?"
1372,THE NEW SIRENS,"--Or, are those old thoughts returning,"
1373,THE NEW SIRENS,"Guests the dull sense never knew,"
1374,THE NEW SIRENS,"Stars, set deep, yet inly burning,"
1375,THE NEW SIRENS,"Germs, your untrimm'd passion overgrew?"
1376,THE NEW SIRENS,
1377,THE NEW SIRENS,"Once, like us, you took your station"
1378,THE NEW SIRENS,Watchers for a purer fire;
1379,THE NEW SIRENS,"But you droop'd in expectation,"
1380,THE NEW SIRENS,And you wearied in desire.
1381,THE NEW SIRENS,When the first rose flush was steeping
1382,THE NEW SIRENS,"All the frore peak's awful crown,"
1383,THE NEW SIRENS,"Shepherds say, they found you sleeping"
1384,THE NEW SIRENS,"In some windless valley, farther down."
1385,THE NEW SIRENS,
1386,THE NEW SIRENS,"Then you wept, and slowly raising"
1387,THE NEW SIRENS,"Your dozed eyelids, sought again,"
1388,THE NEW SIRENS,"Half in doubt, they say, and gazing"
1389,THE NEW SIRENS,"Sadly back, the seats of men;--"
1390,THE NEW SIRENS,Snatch'd a turbid inspiration
1391,THE NEW SIRENS,"From some transient earthly sun,"
1392,THE NEW SIRENS,And proclaim'd your vain ovation
1393,THE NEW SIRENS,For those mimic raptures you had won....
1394,THE NEW SIRENS,
1395,THE NEW SIRENS,*       *       *       *       *
1396,THE NEW SIRENS,
1397,THE NEW SIRENS,"With a sad, majestic motion,"
1398,THE NEW SIRENS,"With a stately, slow surprise,"
1399,THE NEW SIRENS,From their earthward-bound devotion
1400,THE NEW SIRENS,Lifting up your languid eyes--
1401,THE NEW SIRENS,"Would you freeze my too loud boldness,"
1402,THE NEW SIRENS,"Dumbly smiling as you go,"
1403,THE NEW SIRENS,One faint frown of distant coldness
1404,THE NEW SIRENS,Flitting fast across each marble brow?
1405,THE NEW SIRENS,
1406,THE NEW SIRENS,"Do I brighten at your sorrow,"
1407,THE NEW SIRENS,O sweet Pleaders?--doth my lot
1408,THE NEW SIRENS,Find assurance in to-morrow
1409,THE NEW SIRENS,"Of one joy, which you have not?"
1410,THE NEW SIRENS,"O, speak once, and shame my sadness!"
1411,THE NEW SIRENS,"Let this sobbing, Phrygian strain,"
1412,THE NEW SIRENS,"Mock'd and baffled by your gladness,"
1413,THE NEW SIRENS,Mar the music of your feasts in vain!

1416,THE NEW SIRENS,

1418,THE NEW SIRENS,"Gust on gust, the harsh winds blow--"
1419,THE NEW SIRENS,"Come, bind up those ringlet showers!"
1420,THE NEW SIRENS,Roses for that dreaming brow!
1421,THE NEW SIRENS,"Come, once more that ancient lightness,"
1422,THE NEW SIRENS,"Glancing feet, and eager eyes!"
1423,THE NEW SIRENS,Let your broad lamps flash the brightness
1424,THE NEW SIRENS,Which the sorrow-stricken day denies!
1425,THE NEW SIRENS,
1426,THE NEW SIRENS,"Through black depths of serried shadows,"
1427,THE NEW SIRENS,Up cold aisles of buried glade;
1428,THE NEW SIRENS,In the midst of river-meadows
1429,THE NEW SIRENS,Where the looming kine are laid;
1430,THE NEW SIRENS,"From your dazzled windows streaming,"
1431,THE NEW SIRENS,"From your humming festal room,"
1432,THE NEW SIRENS,"Deep and far, a broken gleaming"
1433,THE NEW SIRENS,Reels and shivers on the ruffled gloom.
1434,THE NEW SIRENS,
1435,THE NEW SIRENS,"Where I stand, the grass is glowing;"
1436,THE NEW SIRENS,Doubtless you are passing fair!
1437,THE NEW SIRENS,"But I hear the north wind blowing,"
1438,THE NEW SIRENS,And I feel the cold night-air.
1439,THE NEW SIRENS,"Can I look on your sweet faces,"
1440,THE NEW SIRENS,"And your proud heads backward thrown,"
1441,THE NEW SIRENS,From this dusk of leaf-strewn places
1442,THE NEW SIRENS,With the dumb woods and the night alone?
1443,THE NEW SIRENS,
1444,THE NEW SIRENS,"Yet, indeed, this flux of guesses--"
1445,THE NEW SIRENS,"Mad delight, and frozen calms--"
1446,THE NEW SIRENS,"Mirth to-day and vine-bound tresses,"
1447,THE NEW SIRENS,And to-morrow--folded palms;
1448,THE NEW SIRENS,Is this all? this balanced measure?
1449,THE NEW SIRENS,Could life run no happier way?
1450,THE NEW SIRENS,"Joyous, at the height of pleasure,"
1451,THE NEW SIRENS,Passive at the nadir of dismay?
1452,THE NEW SIRENS,
1453,THE NEW SIRENS,"But, indeed, this proud possession,"
1454,THE NEW SIRENS,"This far-reaching, magic chain,"
1455,THE NEW SIRENS,Linking in a mad succession
1456,THE NEW SIRENS,Fits of joy and fits of pain--
1457,THE NEW SIRENS,Have you seen it at the closing?
1458,THE NEW SIRENS,Have you track'd its clouded ways?
1459,THE NEW SIRENS,"Can your eyes, while fools are dozing,"
1460,THE NEW SIRENS,"Drop, with mine, adown life's latter days?"
1461,THE NEW SIRENS,
1462,THE NEW SIRENS,When a dreary dawn is wading
1463,THE NEW SIRENS,"Through this waste of sunless greens,"
1464,THE NEW SIRENS,When the flushing hues are fading
1465,THE NEW SIRENS,On the peerless cheek of queens;
1466,THE NEW SIRENS,"When the mean shall no more sorrow,"
1467,THE NEW SIRENS,And the proudest no more smile;
1468,THE NEW SIRENS,"As old age, youth's fatal morrow,"
1469,THE NEW SIRENS,Spreads its cold light wider all that while?
1470,THE NEW SIRENS,
1471,THE NEW SIRENS,"Then, when change itself is over,"
1472,THE NEW SIRENS,"When the slow tide sets one way,"
1473,THE NEW SIRENS,"Shall you find the radiant lover,"
1474,THE NEW SIRENS,"Even by moments, of to-day?"
1475,THE NEW SIRENS,"The eye wanders, faith is failing--"
1476,THE NEW SIRENS,"O, loose hands, and let it be!"
1477,THE NEW SIRENS,"Proudly, like a king bewailing,"
1478,THE NEW SIRENS,"O, let fall one tear, and set us free!"
1479,THE NEW SIRENS,
1480,THE NEW SIRENS,All true speech and large avowal
1481,THE NEW SIRENS,Which the jealous soul concedes;
1482,THE NEW SIRENS,"All man's heart which brooks bestowal,"
1483,THE NEW SIRENS,All frank faith which passion breeds--
1484,THE NEW SIRENS,"These we had, and we gave truly;"
1485,THE NEW SIRENS,"Doubt not, what we had, we gave!"
1486,THE NEW SIRENS,"False we were not, nor unruly;"
1487,THE NEW SIRENS,Lodgers in the forest and the cave.
1488,THE NEW SIRENS,
1489,THE NEW SIRENS,"Long we wander'd with you, feeding"
1490,THE NEW SIRENS,"Our rapt souls on your replies,"
1491,THE NEW SIRENS,In a wistful silence reading
1492,THE NEW SIRENS,All the meaning of your eyes.
1493,THE NEW SIRENS,"By moss-border'd statues sitting,"
1494,THE NEW SIRENS,"By well-heads, in summer days."
1495,THE NEW SIRENS,"But we turn, our eyes are flitting--"
1496,THE NEW SIRENS,"See, the white east, and the morning rays!"
1497,THE NEW SIRENS,
1498,THE NEW SIRENS,"And you too, O worshipp'd Graces,"
1499,THE NEW SIRENS,Sylvan Gods of this fair shade!
1500,THE NEW SIRENS,Is there doubt on divine faces?
1501,THE NEW SIRENS,Are the blessed Gods dismay'd?
1502,THE NEW SIRENS,"Can men worship the wan features,"
1503,THE NEW SIRENS,"The sunk eyes, the wailing tone,"
1504,THE NEW SIRENS,"Of unsphered, discrowned creatures,"
1505,THE NEW SIRENS,Souls as little godlike as their own?
1506,THE NEW SIRENS,
1507,THE NEW SIRENS,"Come, loose hands! The winged fleetness"
1508,THE NEW SIRENS,Of immortal feet is gone;
1509,THE NEW SIRENS,"And your scents have shed their sweetness,"
1510,THE NEW SIRENS,And your flowers are overblown.
1511,THE NEW SIRENS,And your jewell'd gauds surrender
1512,THE NEW SIRENS,Half their glories to the day;
1513,THE NEW SIRENS,"Freely did they flash their splendour,"

2317,TO FAUSTA,"He hath not lived, if he lives so."
2318,TO FAUSTA,"He sees, in some great-historied land,"
2319,TO FAUSTA,"A ruler of the people stand,"
2320,TO FAUSTA,Sees his strong thought in fiery flood
2321,TO FAUSTA,Roll through the heaving multitude
2322,TO FAUSTA,Exults--yet for no moment's space
2323,TO FAUSTA,Envies the all-regarded place.
2324,TO FAUSTA,Beautiful eyes meet his--and he
2325,TO FAUSTA,Bears to admire uncravingly;
2326,TO FAUSTA,"They pass--he, mingled with the crowd,"
2327,TO FAUSTA,Is in their far-off triumphs proud.
2328,TO FAUSTA,"From some high station he looks down,"
2329,TO FAUSTA,"At sunset, on a populous town;"
2330,TO FAUSTA,"Surveys each happy group, which fleets,"
2331,TO FAUSTA,"Toil ended, through the shining streets,"
2332,TO FAUSTA,Each with some errand of its own--
2333,TO FAUSTA,And does not say: _I am alone._
2334,TO FAUSTA,He sees the gentle stir of birth
2335,TO FAUSTA,When morning purifies the earth;
2336,TO FAUSTA,He leans upon a gate and sees
2337,TO FAUSTA,"The pastures, and the quiet trees."
2338,TO FAUSTA,"Low, woody hill, with gracious bound,"
2339,TO FAUSTA,Folds the still valley almost round;
2340,TO FAUSTA,"The cuckoo, loud on some high lawn,"
2341,TO FAUSTA,Is answer'd from the depth of dawn;
2342,TO FAUSTA,"In the hedge straggling to the stream,"
2343,TO FAUSTA,"Pale, dew-drench'd, half-shut roses gleam;"
2344,TO FAUSTA,"But, where the farther side slopes down,"
2345,TO FAUSTA,He sees the drowsy new-waked clown
2346,TO FAUSTA,In his white quaint-embroider'd frock
2347,TO FAUSTA,"Make, whistling, tow'rd his mist-wreathed flock--"
2348,TO FAUSTA,"Slowly, behind his heavy tread,"
2349,TO FAUSTA,"The wet, flower'd grass heaves up its head."
2350,TO FAUSTA,"Lean'd on his gate, he gazes--tears"
2351,TO FAUSTA,"Are in his eyes, and in his ears"
2352,TO FAUSTA,The murmur of a thousand years.
2353,TO FAUSTA,"Before him he sees life unroll,"
2354,TO FAUSTA,A placid and continuous whole--
2355,TO FAUSTA,"That general life, which does not cease,"
2356,TO FAUSTA,"Whose secret is not joy, but peace;"
2357,TO FAUSTA,"That life, whose dumb wish is not miss'd"
2358,TO FAUSTA,"If birth proceeds, if things subsist;"
2359,TO FAUSTA,"The life of plants, and stones, and rain,"
2360,TO FAUSTA,The life he craves--if not in vain
2361,TO FAUSTA,"Fate gave, what chance shall not control,"
2362,TO FAUSTA,His sad lucidity of soul.
2363,TO FAUSTA,
2364,TO FAUSTA,"You listen--but that wandering smile,"
2365,TO FAUSTA,"Fausta, betrays you cold the while!"
2366,TO FAUSTA,Your eyes pursue the bells of foam
2367,TO FAUSTA,"Wash'd, eddying, from this bank, their home."
2368,TO FAUSTA,"_Those gipsies_, so your thoughts I scan,"
2369,TO FAUSTA,"_Are less, the poet more, than man._"
2370,TO FAUSTA,"_They feel not, though they move and see;_"
2371,TO FAUSTA,_Deeper the poet feels; but he_
2372,TO FAUSTA,"_Breathes, when he will, immortal air,_"
2373,TO FAUSTA,_Where Orpheus and where Homer are._
2374,TO FAUSTA,"_In the day's life, whose iron round_"
2375,TO FAUSTA,"_Hems us all in, he is not bound;_"
2376,TO FAUSTA,"_He leaves his kind, o'erleaps their pen,_"
2377,TO FAUSTA,_And flees the common life of men._
2378,TO FAUSTA,"_He escapes thence, but we abide--_"
2379,TO FAUSTA,"_Not deep the poet sees, but wide._"
2380,TO FAUSTA,
2381,TO FAUSTA,*       *       *       *       *
2382,TO FAUSTA,
2383,TO FAUSTA,The world in which we live and move
2384,TO FAUSTA,"Outlasts aversion, outlasts love,"
2385,TO FAUSTA,"Outlasts each effort, interest, hope,"
2386,TO FAUSTA,"Remorse, grief, joy;--and were the scope"
2387,TO FAUSTA,"Of these affections wider made,"
2388,TO FAUSTA,"Man still would see, and see dismay'd,"
2389,TO FAUSTA,"Beyond his passion's widest range,"
2390,TO FAUSTA,Far regions of eternal change.
2391,TO FAUSTA,"Nay, and since death, which wipes out man,"
2392,TO FAUSTA,"Finds him with many an unsolved plan,"
2393,TO FAUSTA,"With much unknown, and much untried,"
2394,TO FAUSTA,"Wonder not dead, and thirst not dried,"
2395,TO FAUSTA,Still gazing on the ever full
2396,TO FAUSTA,Eternal mundane spectacle--
2397,TO FAUSTA,"This world in which we draw our breath,"
2398,TO FAUSTA,"In some sense, Fausta, outlasts death."
2399,TO FAUSTA,"Blame thou not, therefore, him who dares"
2400,TO FAUSTA,Judge vain beforehand human cares;
2401,TO FAUSTA,Whose natural insight can discern
2402,TO FAUSTA,What through experience others learn;
2403,TO FAUSTA,"Who needs not love and power, to know"
2404,TO FAUSTA,"Love transient, power an unreal show;"
2405,TO FAUSTA,Who treads at ease life's uncheer'd ways--
2406,TO FAUSTA,"Him blame not, Fausta, rather praise!"
2407,TO FAUSTA,Rather thyself for some aim pray
2408,TO FAUSTA,"Nobler than this, to fill the day;"
2409,TO FAUSTA,"Rather that heart, which burns in thee,"
2410,TO FAUSTA,"Ask, not to amuse, but to set free;"
2411,TO FAUSTA,Be passionate hopes not ill resign'd
2412,TO FAUSTA,"For quiet, and a fearless mind."
2413,TO FAUSTA,And though fate grudge to thee and me
2414,TO FAUSTA,"The poet's rapt security,"
2415,TO FAUSTA,"Yet they, believe me, who await"
2416,TO FAUSTA,"No gifts from chance, have conquer'd fate."
2417,TO FAUSTA,"They, winning room to see and hear,"
2418,TO FAUSTA,"And to men's business not too near,"
2419,TO FAUSTA,Through clouds of individual strife
2420,TO FAUSTA,Draw homeward to the general life.
2421,TO FAUSTA,Like leaves by suns not yet uncurl'd;
2422,TO FAUSTA,"To the wise, foolish; to the world,"
2423,TO FAUSTA,"Weak;--yet not weak, I might reply,"
2424,TO FAUSTA,"Not foolish, Fausta, in His eye,"
2425,TO FAUSTA,"To whom each moment in its race,"
2426,TO FAUSTA,"Crowd as we will its neutral space,"
2427,TO FAUSTA,Is but a quiet watershed
2428,TO FAUSTA,"Whence, equally, the seas of life and death are fed."
2429,TO FAUSTA,
2430,TO FAUSTA,"Enough, we live!--and if a life,"
2431,TO FAUSTA,"With large results so little rife,"
2432,TO FAUSTA,"Though bearable, seem hardly worth"
2433,TO FAUSTA,"This pomp of worlds, this pain of birth;"
2434,TO FAUSTA,"Yet, Fausta, the mute turf we tread,"
2435,TO FAUSTA,"The solemn hills around us spread,"
2436,TO FAUSTA,"This stream which falls incessantly,"
2437,TO FAUSTA,"The strange-scrawl'd rocks, the lonely sky,"
2438,TO FAUSTA,"If I might lend their life a voice,"
2439,TO FAUSTA,Seem to bear rather than rejoice.
2440,TO FAUSTA,And even could the intemperate prayer
2441,TO FAUSTA,"Man iterates, while these forbear,"
2442,TO FAUSTA,"For movement, for an ampler sphere,"
2443,TO FAUSTA,Pierce Fate's impenetrable ear;
2444,TO FAUSTA,Not milder is the general lot
2445,TO FAUSTA,"Because our spirits have forgot,"
2446,TO FAUSTA,"In action's dizzying eddy whirl'd,"
2447,TO FAUSTA,The something that infects the world.

2459,AN EPISODE,AN EPISODE
2460,AN EPISODE,
2461,AN EPISODE,
2462,AN EPISODE,"And the first grey of morning fill'd the east,"
2463,AN EPISODE,And the fog rose out of the Oxus stream.
2464,AN EPISODE,But all the Tartar camp along the stream
2465,AN EPISODE,"Was hush'd, and still the men were plunged in sleep;"
2466,AN EPISODE,"Sohrab alone, he slept not; all night long"
2467,AN EPISODE,"He had lain wakeful, tossing on his bed;"
2468,AN EPISODE,"But when the grey dawn stole into his tent,"
2469,AN EPISODE,"He rose, and clad himself, and girt his sword,"
2470,AN EPISODE,"And took his horseman's cloak, and left his tent,"
2471,AN EPISODE,"And went abroad into the cold wet fog,"
2472,AN EPISODE,Through the dim camp to Peran-Wisa's tent.
2473,AN EPISODE,"Through the black Tartar tents he pass'd, which stood"
2474,AN EPISODE,Clustering like bee-hives on the low flat strand
2475,AN EPISODE,"Of Oxus, where the summer-floods o'erflow"
2476,AN EPISODE,When the sun melts the snows in high Pamere;
2477,AN EPISODE,"Through the black tents he pass'd, o'er that low strand,"
2478,AN EPISODE,"And to a hillock came, a little back"
2479,AN EPISODE,"From the stream's brink--the spot where first a boat,"
2480,AN EPISODE,"Crossing the stream in summer, scrapes the land."
2481,AN EPISODE,The men of former times had crown'd the top
2482,AN EPISODE,"With a clay fort; but that was fall'n, and now"
2483,AN EPISODE,"The Tartars built there Peran-Wisa's tent,"
2484,AN EPISODE,"A dome of laths, and o'er it felts were spread."
2485,AN EPISODE,"And Sohrab came there, and went in, and stood"
2486,AN EPISODE,"Upon the thick piled carpets in the tent,"
2487,AN EPISODE,And found the old man sleeping on his bed
2488,AN EPISODE,"Of rugs and felts, and near him lay his arms."
2489,AN EPISODE,"And Peran-Wisa heard him, though the step"
2490,AN EPISODE,"Was dull'd; for he slept light, an old man's sleep;"
2491,AN EPISODE,"And he rose quickly on one arm, and said:--"
2492,AN EPISODE,"""Who art thou? for it is not yet clear dawn."
2493,AN EPISODE,"Speak! is there news, or any night alarm?"""
2494,AN EPISODE,"But Sohrab came to the bedside, and said:--"
2495,AN EPISODE,"""Thou know'st me, Peran-Wisa! it is I."
2496,AN EPISODE,"The sun is not yet risen, and the foe"
2497,AN EPISODE,Sleep; but I sleep not; all night long I lie
2498,AN EPISODE,"Tossing and wakeful, and I come to thee."
2499,AN EPISODE,For so did King Afrasiab bid me seek
2500,AN EPISODE,"Thy counsel, and to heed thee as thy son,"
2501,AN EPISODE,"In Samarcand, before the army march'd;"
2502,AN EPISODE,And I will tell thee what my heart desires.
2503,AN EPISODE,"Thou know'st if, since from Ader-baijan first"
2504,AN EPISODE,"I came among the Tartars and bore arms,"
2505,AN EPISODE,"I have still served Afrasiab well, and shown,"
2506,AN EPISODE,"At my boy's years, the courage of a man."
2507,AN EPISODE,"This too thou know'st, that while I still bear on"
2508,AN EPISODE,"The conquering Tartar ensigns through the world,"
2509,AN EPISODE,"And beat the Persians back on every field,"
2510,AN EPISODE,"I seek one man, one man, and one alone--"
2511,AN EPISODE,"Rustum, my father; who I hoped should greet,"
2512,AN EPISODE,"Should one day greet, upon some well-fought field,"
2513,AN EPISODE,"His not unworthy, not inglorious son."
2514,AN EPISODE,"So I long hoped, but him I never find."
2515,AN EPISODE,"Come then, hear now, and grant me what I ask."
2516,AN EPISODE,Let the two armies rest to-day; but I
2517,AN EPISODE,Will challenge forth the bravest Persian lords
2518,AN EPISODE,"To meet me, man to man; if I prevail,"
2519,AN EPISODE,Rustum will surely hear it; if I fall--
2520,AN EPISODE,"Old man, the dead need no one, claim no kin."
2521,AN EPISODE,"Dim is the rumour of a common fight,"
2522,AN EPISODE,"Where host meets host, and many names are sunk;"
2523,AN EPISODE,"But of a single combat fame speaks clear."""
2524,AN EPISODE,He spoke; and Peran-Wisa took the hand
2525,AN EPISODE,"Of the young man in his, and sigh'd, and said:--"
2526,AN EPISODE,"""O Sohrab, an unquiet heart is thine!"
2527,AN EPISODE,"Canst thou not rest among the Tartar chiefs,"
2528,AN EPISODE,And share the battle's common chance with us
2529,AN EPISODE,"Who love thee, but must press for ever first,"
2530,AN EPISODE,"In single fight incurring single risk,"
2531,AN EPISODE,To find a father thou hast never seen?
2532,AN EPISODE,"That were far best, my son, to stay with us"
2533,AN EPISODE,"Unmurmuring; in our tents, while it is war,"
2534,AN EPISODE,"And when 'tis truce, then in Afrasiab's towns."
2535,AN EPISODE,"But, if this one desire indeed rules all,"
2536,AN EPISODE,To seek out Rustum--seek him not through fight!
2537,AN EPISODE,"Seek him in peace, and carry to his arms,"
2538,AN EPISODE,"O Sohrab, carry an unwounded son!"
2539,AN EPISODE,"But far hence seek him, for he is not here."
2540,AN EPISODE,"For now it is not as when I was young,"
2541,AN EPISODE,When Rustum was in front of every fray;
2542,AN EPISODE,"But now he keeps apart, and sits at home,"
2543,AN EPISODE,"In Seistan, with Zal, his father old."
2544,AN EPISODE,Whether that his own mighty strength at last
2545,AN EPISODE,"Feels the abhorr'd approaches of old age,"
2546,AN EPISODE,Or in some quarrel with the Persian King.
2547,AN EPISODE,There go!--Thou wilt not? Yet my heart forebodes
2548,AN EPISODE,Danger or death awaits thee on this field.
2549,AN EPISODE,"Fain would I know thee safe and well, though lost"
2550,AN EPISODE,"To us; fain therefore send thee hence, in peace"
2551,AN EPISODE,"To seek thy father, not seek single fights"
2552,AN EPISODE,In vain;--but who can keep the lion's cub
2553,AN EPISODE,"From ravening, and who govern Rustum's son?"
2554,AN EPISODE,"Go, I will grant thee what thy heart desires."""
2555,AN EPISODE,"So said he, and dropp'd Sohrab's hand, and left"
2556,AN EPISODE,"His bed, and the warm rugs whereon he lay;"
2557,AN EPISODE,And o'er his chilly limbs his woollen coat
2558,AN EPISODE,"He pass'd, and tied his sandals on his feet,"
2559,AN EPISODE,"And threw a white cloak round him, and he took"
2560,AN EPISODE,"In his right hand a ruler's staff, no sword;"
2561,AN EPISODE,"And on his head he set his sheep-skin cap,"
2562,AN EPISODE,"Black, glossy, curl'd, the fleece of Kara-Kul;"
2563,AN EPISODE,"And raised the curtain of his tent, and call'd"
2564,AN EPISODE,"His herald to his side, and went abroad."
2565,AN EPISODE,"The sun by this had risen, and clear'd the fog"
2566,AN EPISODE,From the broad Oxus and the glittering sands.
2567,AN EPISODE,And from their tents the Tartar horsemen filed
2568,AN EPISODE,Into the open plain; so Haman bade--
2569,AN EPISODE,"Haman, who next to Peran-Wisa ruled"
2570,AN EPISODE,"The host, and still was in his lusty prime."
2571,AN EPISODE,"From their black tents, long files of horse, they stream'd;"
2572,AN EPISODE,"As when some grey November morn the files,"
2573,AN EPISODE,"In marching order spread, of long-neck'd cranes"
2574,AN EPISODE,Stream over Casbin and the southern slopes
2575,AN EPISODE,"Of Elburz, from the Aralian estuaries,"
2576,AN EPISODE,"Or some frore Caspian reed-bed, southward bound"
2577,AN EPISODE,For the warm Persian sea-board--so they stream'd.
2578,AN EPISODE,"The Tartars of the Oxus, the King's guard,"
2579,AN EPISODE,"First, with black sheep-skin caps and with long spears;"
2580,AN EPISODE,"Large men, large steeds; who from Bokhara come"
2581,AN EPISODE,"And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares."
2582,AN EPISODE,"Next, the more temperate Toorkmuns of the south,"
2583,AN EPISODE,"The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,"
2584,AN EPISODE,And those from Attruck and the Caspian sands;
2585,AN EPISODE,"Light men and on light steeds, who only drink"
2586,AN EPISODE,"The acrid milk of camels, and their wells."
2587,AN EPISODE,"And then a swarm of wandering horse, who came"
2588,AN EPISODE,"From far, and a more doubtful service own'd;"
2589,AN EPISODE,"The Tartars of Ferghana, from the banks"
2590,AN EPISODE,"Of the Jaxartes, men with scanty beards"
2591,AN EPISODE,And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes
2592,AN EPISODE,"Who roam o'er Kipchak and the northern waste,"
2593,AN EPISODE,"Kalmucks and unkempt Kuzzaks, tribes who stray"
2594,AN EPISODE,"Nearest the Pole, and wandering Kirghizzes,"
2595,AN EPISODE,Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere;
2596,AN EPISODE,These all filed out from camp into the plain.
2597,AN EPISODE,And on the other side the Persians form'd;--
2598,AN EPISODE,"First a light cloud of horse, Tartars they seem'd,"
2599,AN EPISODE,"The Ilyats of Khorassan; and behind,"
2600,AN EPISODE,"The royal troops of Persia, horse and foot,"
2601,AN EPISODE,Marshall'd battalions bright in burnish'd steel.
2602,AN EPISODE,"But Peran-Wisa with his herald came,"
2603,AN EPISODE,"Threading the Tartar squadrons to the front,"
2604,AN EPISODE,And with his staff kept back the foremost ranks.
2605,AN EPISODE,"And when Ferood, who led the Persians, saw"
2606,AN EPISODE,"That Peran-Wisa kept the Tartars back,"
2607,AN EPISODE,"He took his spear, and to the front he came,"
2608,AN EPISODE,"And check'd his ranks, and fix'd them where they stood."
2609,AN EPISODE,And the old Tartar came upon the sand
2610,AN EPISODE,"Betwixt the silent hosts, and spake, and said:--"
2611,AN EPISODE,"""Ferood, and ye, Persians and Tartars, hear!"
2612,AN EPISODE,Let there be truce between the hosts to-day.
2613,AN EPISODE,But choose a champion from the Persian lords
2614,AN EPISODE,"To fight our champion Sohrab, man to man."""
2615,AN EPISODE,"As, in the country, on a morn in June,"
2616,AN EPISODE,"When the dew glistens on the pearled ears,"
2617,AN EPISODE,A shiver runs through the deep corn for joy--
2618,AN EPISODE,"So, when they heard what Peran-Wisa said,"
2619,AN EPISODE,A thrill through all the Tartar squadrons ran
2620,AN EPISODE,"Of pride and hope for Sohrab, whom they loved."
2621,AN EPISODE,"But as a troop of pedlars, from Cabool,"
2622,AN EPISODE,"Cross underneath the Indian Caucasus,"
2623,AN EPISODE,That vast sky-neighbouring mountain of milk snow;
2624,AN EPISODE,"Crossing so high, that, as they mount, they pass"
2625,AN EPISODE,"Long flocks of travelling birds dead on the snow,"
2626,AN EPISODE,"Choked by the air, and scarce can they themselves"
2627,AN EPISODE,Slake their parch'd throats with sugar'd mulberries--
2628,AN EPISODE,"In single file they move, and stop their breath,"
2629,AN EPISODE,For fear they should dislodge the o'erhanging snows--
2630,AN EPISODE,So the pale Persians held their breath with fear.
2631,AN EPISODE,And to Ferood his brother chiefs came up
2632,AN EPISODE,"To counsel; Gudurz and Zoarrah came,"
2633,AN EPISODE,"And Feraburz, who ruled the Persian host"
2634,AN EPISODE,"Second, and was the uncle of the King;"
2635,AN EPISODE,"These came and counsell'd, and then Gudurz said:--"
2636,AN EPISODE,"""Ferood, shame bids us take their challenge up,"
2637,AN EPISODE,Yet champion have we none to match this youth.
2638,AN EPISODE,"He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart."
2639,AN EPISODE,But Rustum came last night; aloof he sits
2640,AN EPISODE,"And sullen, and has pitch'd his tents apart."
2641,AN EPISODE,"Him will I seek, and carry to his ear"
2642,AN EPISODE,"The Tartar challenge, and this young man's name."
2643,AN EPISODE,"Haply he will forget his wrath, and fight."
2644,AN EPISODE,"Stand forth the while, and take their challenge up."""
2645,AN EPISODE,So spake he; and Ferood stood forth and cried:--
2646,AN EPISODE,"""Old man, be it agreed as thou hast said!"
2647,AN EPISODE,"Let Sohrab arm, and we will find a man."""
2648,AN EPISODE,"He spake: and Peran-Wisa turn'd, and strode"
2649,AN EPISODE,Back through the opening squadrons to his tent.
2650,AN EPISODE,"But through the anxious Persians Gudurz ran,"
2651,AN EPISODE,"And cross'd the camp which lay behind, and reach'd,"
2652,AN EPISODE,"Out on the sands beyond it, Rustum's tents."
2653,AN EPISODE,"Of scarlet cloth they were, and glittering gay,"
2654,AN EPISODE,Just pitch'd; the high pavilion in the midst
2655,AN EPISODE,"Was Rustum's, and his men lay camp'd around."
2656,AN EPISODE,"And Gudurz enter'd Rustum's tent, and found"
2657,AN EPISODE,"Rustum; his morning meal was done, but still"
2658,AN EPISODE,"The table stood before him, charged with food--"
2659,AN EPISODE,"A side of roasted sheep, and cakes of bread,"
2660,AN EPISODE,And dark green melons; and there Rustum sate
2661,AN EPISODE,"Listless, and held a falcon on his wrist,"
2662,AN EPISODE,And play'd with it; but Gudurz came and stood
2663,AN EPISODE,"Before him; and he look'd, and saw him stand,"
2664,AN EPISODE,"And with a cry sprang up and dropp'd the bird,"
2665,AN EPISODE,"And greeted Gudurz with both hands, and said:--"
2666,AN EPISODE,"""Welcome! these eyes could see no better sight."
2667,AN EPISODE,"What news? but sit down first, and eat and drink."""
2668,AN EPISODE,"But Gudurz stood in the tent-door, and said:--"
2669,AN EPISODE,"""Not now! a time will come to eat and drink,"
2670,AN EPISODE,But not to-day; to-day has other needs.
2671,AN EPISODE,"The armies are drawn out, and stand at gaze;"
2672,AN EPISODE,For from the Tartars is a challenge brought
2673,AN EPISODE,To pick a champion from the Persian lords
2674,AN EPISODE,To fight their champion--and thou know'st his name--
2675,AN EPISODE,"Sohrab men call him, but his birth is hid."
2676,AN EPISODE,"O Rustum, like thy might is this young man's!"
2677,AN EPISODE,"He has the wild stag's foot, the lion's heart;"
2678,AN EPISODE,"And he is young, and Iran's chiefs are old,"
2679,AN EPISODE,Or else too weak; and all eyes turn to thee.
2680,AN EPISODE,"Come down and help us, Rustum, or we lose!"""
2681,AN EPISODE,He spoke; but Rustum answer'd with a smile:--
2682,AN EPISODE,"""Go to! if Iran's chiefs are old, then I"
2683,AN EPISODE,"Am older; if the young are weak, the King"
2684,AN EPISODE,"Errs strangely; for the King, for Kai Khosroo,"
2685,AN EPISODE,"Himself is young, and honours younger men,"
2686,AN EPISODE,And lets the aged moulder to their graves.
2687,AN EPISODE,"Rustum he loves no more, but loves the young--"
2688,AN EPISODE,"The young may rise at Sohrab's vaunts, not I."
2689,AN EPISODE,"For what care I, though all speak Sohrab's fame?"
2690,AN EPISODE,"For would that I myself had such a son,"
2691,AN EPISODE,And not that one slight helpless girl I have--
2692,AN EPISODE,"A son so famed, so brave, to send to war,"
2693,AN EPISODE,"And I to tarry with the snow-hair'd Zal,"
2694,AN EPISODE,"My father, whom the robber Afghans vex,"
2695,AN EPISODE,"And clip his borders short, and drive his herds,"
2696,AN EPISODE,And he has none to guard his weak old age.
2697,AN EPISODE,"There would I go, and hang my armour up,"
2698,AN EPISODE,"And with my great name fence that weak old man,"
2699,AN EPISODE,"And spend the goodly treasures I have got,"
2700,AN EPISODE,"And rest my age, and hear of Sohrab's fame,"
2701,AN EPISODE,"And leave to death the hosts of thankless kings,"
2702,AN EPISODE,"And with these slaughterous hands draw sword no more."""
2703,AN EPISODE,"He spoke, and smiled; and Gudurz made reply:--"
2704,AN EPISODE,"""What then, O Rustum, will men say to this,"
2705,AN EPISODE,"When Sohrab dares our bravest forth, and seeks"
2706,AN EPISODE,"Thee most of all, and thou, whom most he seeks,"
2707,AN EPISODE,Hidest thy face? Take heed lest men should say:
2708,AN EPISODE,"_Like some old miser, Rustum hoards his fame,_"
2709,AN EPISODE,"_And shuns to peril it with younger men._"""
2710,AN EPISODE,"And, greatly moved, then Rustum made reply:--"
2711,AN EPISODE,"""O Gudurz, wherefore dost thou say such words?"
2712,AN EPISODE,Thou knowest better words than this to say.
2713,AN EPISODE,"What is one more, one less, obscure or famed,"
2714,AN EPISODE,"Valiant or craven, young or old, to me?"
2715,AN EPISODE,"Are not they mortal, am not I myself?"
2716,AN EPISODE,But who for men of nought would do great deeds?
2717,AN EPISODE,"Come, thou shalt see how Rustum hoards his fame!"
2718,AN EPISODE,"But I will fight unknown, and in plain arms;"
2719,AN EPISODE,"Let not men say of Rustum, he was match'd"
2720,AN EPISODE,"In single fight with any mortal man."""
2721,AN EPISODE,"He spoke, and frown'd; and Gudurz turn'd, and ran"
2722,AN EPISODE,Back quickly through the camp in fear and joy--
2723,AN EPISODE,"Fear at his wrath, but joy that Rustum came."
2724,AN EPISODE,"But Rustum strode to his tent-door, and call'd"
2725,AN EPISODE,"His followers in, and bade them bring his arms,"
2726,AN EPISODE,And clad himself in steel; the arms he chose
2727,AN EPISODE,"Were plain, and on his shield was no device,"
2728,AN EPISODE,"Only his helm was rich, inlaid with gold,"
2729,AN EPISODE,"And, from the fluted spine atop, a plume"
2730,AN EPISODE,"Of horsehair waved, a scarlet horsehair plume."
2731,AN EPISODE,"So arm'd, he issued forth; and Ruksh, his horse,"
2732,AN EPISODE,Follow'd him like a faithful hound at heel--
2733,AN EPISODE,"Ruksh, whose renown was noised through all the earth,"
2734,AN EPISODE,"The horse, whom Rustum on a foray once"
2735,AN EPISODE,Did in Bokhara by the river find
2736,AN EPISODE,"A colt beneath its dam, and drove him home,"
2737,AN EPISODE,"And rear'd him; a bright bay, with lofty crest,"
2738,AN EPISODE,Dight with a saddle-cloth of broider'd green
2739,AN EPISODE,"Crusted with gold, and on the ground were work'd"
2740,AN EPISODE,"All beasts of chase, all beasts which hunters know."
2741,AN EPISODE,"So follow'd, Rustum left his tents, and cross'd"
2742,AN EPISODE,"The camp, and to the Persian host appear'd."
2743,AN EPISODE,"And all the Persians knew him, and with shouts"
2744,AN EPISODE,Hail'd; but the Tartars knew not who he was.
2745,AN EPISODE,And dear as the wet diver to the eyes
2746,AN EPISODE,"Of his pale wife who waits and weeps on shore,"
2747,AN EPISODE,"By sandy Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf,"
2748,AN EPISODE,"Plunging all day in the blue waves, at night,"
2749,AN EPISODE,"Having made up his tale of precious pearls,"
2750,AN EPISODE,Rejoins her in their hut upon the sands--
2751,AN EPISODE,So dear to the pale Persians Rustum came.
2752,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum to the Persian front advanced,"
2753,AN EPISODE,"And Sohrab arm'd in Haman's tent, and came."
2754,AN EPISODE,And as afield the reapers cut a swath
2755,AN EPISODE,"Down through the middle of a rich man's corn,"
2756,AN EPISODE,"And on each side are squares of standing corn,"
2757,AN EPISODE,"And in the midst a stubble, short and bare--"
2758,AN EPISODE,"So on each side were squares of men, with spears"
2759,AN EPISODE,"Bristling, and in the midst, the open sand."
2760,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum came upon the sand, and cast"
2761,AN EPISODE,"His eyes toward the Tartar tents, and saw"
2762,AN EPISODE,"Sohrab come forth, and eyed him as he came."
2763,AN EPISODE,"As some rich woman, on a winter's morn,"
2764,AN EPISODE,Eyes through her silken curtains the poor drudge
2765,AN EPISODE,Who with numb blacken'd fingers makes her fire--
2766,AN EPISODE,"At cock-crow, on a starlit winter's morn,"
2767,AN EPISODE,When the frost flowers the whiten'd window-panes--
2768,AN EPISODE,"And wonders how she lives, and what the thoughts"
2769,AN EPISODE,Of that poor drudge may be; so Rustum eyed
2770,AN EPISODE,"The unknown adventurous youth, who from afar"
2771,AN EPISODE,"Came seeking Rustum, and defying forth"
2772,AN EPISODE,All the most valiant chiefs; long he perused
2773,AN EPISODE,"His spirited air, and wonder'd who he was."
2774,AN EPISODE,"For very young he seem'd, tenderly rear'd;"
2775,AN EPISODE,"Like some young cypress, tall, and dark, and straight,"
2776,AN EPISODE,Which in a queen's secluded garden throws
2777,AN EPISODE,"Its slight dark shadow on the moonlit turf,"
2778,AN EPISODE,"By midnight, to a bubbling fountain's sound--"
2779,AN EPISODE,"So slender Sohrab seem'd, so softly rear'd."
2780,AN EPISODE,And a deep pity enter'd Rustum's soul
2781,AN EPISODE,"As he beheld him coming; and he stood,"
2782,AN EPISODE,"And beckon'd to him with his hand, and said:--"
2783,AN EPISODE,"""O thou young man, the air of Heaven is soft,"
2784,AN EPISODE,"And warm, and pleasant; but the grave is cold!"
2785,AN EPISODE,Heaven's air is better than the cold dead grave.
2786,AN EPISODE,"Behold me! I am vast, and clad in iron,"
2787,AN EPISODE,And tried; and I have stood on many a field
2788,AN EPISODE,"Of blood, and I have fought with many a foe--"
2789,AN EPISODE,"Never was that field lost, or that foe saved."
2790,AN EPISODE,"O Sohrab, wherefore wilt thou rush on death?"
2791,AN EPISODE,"Be govern'd! quit the Tartar host, and come"
2792,AN EPISODE,"To Iran, and be as my son to me,"
2793,AN EPISODE,And fight beneath my banner till I die!
2794,AN EPISODE,"There are no youths in Iran brave as thou."""
2795,AN EPISODE,"So he spake, mildly; Sohrab heard his voice,"
2796,AN EPISODE,"The mighty voice of Rustum, and he saw"
2797,AN EPISODE,"His giant figure planted on the sand,"
2798,AN EPISODE,"Sole, like some single tower, which a chief"
2799,AN EPISODE,Hath builded on the waste in former years
2800,AN EPISODE,"Against the robbers; and he saw that head,"
2801,AN EPISODE,"Streak'd with its first grey hairs;--hope filled his soul,"
2802,AN EPISODE,"And he ran forward and embraced his knees,"
2803,AN EPISODE,"And clasp'd his hand within his own, and said:--"
2804,AN EPISODE,"""O, by thy father's head! by thine own soul!"
2805,AN EPISODE,"Art thou not Rustum? speak! art thou not he?"""
2806,AN EPISODE,"But Rustum eyed askance the kneeling youth,"
2807,AN EPISODE,"And turn'd away, and spake to his own soul:--"
2808,AN EPISODE,"""Ah me, I muse what this young fox may mean!"
2809,AN EPISODE,"False, wily, boastful, are these Tartar boys."
2810,AN EPISODE,"For if I now confess this thing he asks,"
2811,AN EPISODE,"And hide it not, but say: _Rustum is here!_"
2812,AN EPISODE,"He will not yield indeed, nor quit our foes,"
2813,AN EPISODE,"But he will find some pretext not to fight,"
2814,AN EPISODE,"And praise my fame, and proffer courteous gifts"
2815,AN EPISODE,"A belt or sword perhaps, and go his way."
2816,AN EPISODE,"And on a feast-tide, in Afrasiab's hall,"
2817,AN EPISODE,"In Samarcand, he will arise and cry:"
2818,AN EPISODE,"'I challenged once, when the two armies camp'd"
2819,AN EPISODE,"Beside the Oxus, all the Persian lords"
2820,AN EPISODE,To cope with me in single fight; but they
2821,AN EPISODE,"Shrank, only Rustum dared; then he and I"
2822,AN EPISODE,"Changed gifts, and went on equal terms away.'"
2823,AN EPISODE,"So will he speak, perhaps, while men applaud;"
2824,AN EPISODE,"Then were the chiefs of Iran shamed through me."""
2825,AN EPISODE,"And then he turn'd, and sternly spake aloud:--"
2826,AN EPISODE,"""Rise! wherefore dost thou vainly question thus"
2827,AN EPISODE,"Of Rustum? I am here, whom thou hast call'd"
2828,AN EPISODE,"By challenge forth; make good thy vaunt, or yield!"
2829,AN EPISODE,Is it with Rustum only thou wouldst fight?
2830,AN EPISODE,"Rash boy, men look on Rustum's face and flee!"
2831,AN EPISODE,"For well I know, that did great Rustum stand"
2832,AN EPISODE,"Before thy face this day, and were reveal'd,"
2833,AN EPISODE,There would be then no talk of fighting more.
2834,AN EPISODE,"But being what I am, I tell thee this--"
2835,AN EPISODE,Do thou record it in thine inmost soul:
2836,AN EPISODE,"Either thou shalt renounce thy vaunt and yield,"
2837,AN EPISODE,"Or else thy bones shall strew this sand, till winds"
2838,AN EPISODE,"Bleach them, or Oxus with his summer-floods,"
2839,AN EPISODE,"Oxus in summer wash them all away."""
2840,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; and Sohrab answer'd, on his feet:--"
2841,AN EPISODE,"""Art thou so fierce? Thou wilt not fright me so!"
2842,AN EPISODE,"I am no girl, to be made pale by words."
2843,AN EPISODE,"Yet this thou hast said well, did Rustum stand"
2844,AN EPISODE,"Here on this field, there were no fighting then."
2845,AN EPISODE,"But Rustum is far hence, and we stand here."
2846,AN EPISODE,"Begin! thou art more vast, more dread than I,"
2847,AN EPISODE,"And thou art proved, I know, and I am young--"
2848,AN EPISODE,But yet success sways with the breath of Heaven.
2849,AN EPISODE,And though thou thinkest that thou knowest sure
2850,AN EPISODE,"Thy victory, yet thou canst not surely know."
2851,AN EPISODE,"For we are all, like swimmers in the sea,"
2852,AN EPISODE,"Poised on the top of a huge wave of fate,"
2853,AN EPISODE,Which hangs uncertain to which side to fall.
2854,AN EPISODE,"And whether it will heave us up to land,"
2855,AN EPISODE,"Or whether it will roll us out to sea,"
2856,AN EPISODE,"Back out to sea, to the deep waves of death,"
2857,AN EPISODE,"We know not, and no search will make us know;"
2858,AN EPISODE,"Only the event will teach us in its hour."""
2859,AN EPISODE,"He spoke, and Rustum answer'd not, but hurl'd"
2860,AN EPISODE,"His spear; down from the shoulder, down it came,"
2861,AN EPISODE,"As on some partridge in the corn a hawk,"
2862,AN EPISODE,"That long has tower'd in the airy clouds,"
2863,AN EPISODE,"Drops like a plummet; Sohrab saw it come,"
2864,AN EPISODE,"And sprang aside, quick as a flash; the spear"
2865,AN EPISODE,"Hiss'd, and went quivering down into the sand,"
2866,AN EPISODE,Which it sent flying wide;--then Sohrab threw
2867,AN EPISODE,"In turn, and full struck Rustum's shield; sharp rang,"
2868,AN EPISODE,"The iron plates rang sharp, but turn'd the spear."
2869,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum seized his club, which none but he"
2870,AN EPISODE,"Could wield; an unlopp'd trunk it was, and huge,"
2871,AN EPISODE,Still rough--like those which men in treeless plains
2872,AN EPISODE,"To build them boats fish from the flooded rivers,"
2873,AN EPISODE,"Hyphasis or Hydaspes, when, high up"
2874,AN EPISODE,"By their dark springs, the wind in winter-time"
2875,AN EPISODE,"Hath made in Himalayan forests wrack,"
2876,AN EPISODE,And strewn the channels with torn boughs--so huge
2877,AN EPISODE,"The club which Rustum lifted now, and struck"
2878,AN EPISODE,"One stroke; but again Sohrab sprang aside,"
2879,AN EPISODE,"Lithe as the glancing snake, and the club came"
2880,AN EPISODE,"Thundering to earth, and leapt from Rustum's hand."
2881,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum follow'd his own blow, and fell"
2882,AN EPISODE,"To his knees, and with his fingers clutch'd the sand;"
2883,AN EPISODE,"And now might Sohrab have unsheathed his sword,"
2884,AN EPISODE,And pierced the mighty Rustum while he lay
2885,AN EPISODE,"Dizzy, and on his knees, and choked with sand;"
2886,AN EPISODE,"But he look'd on, and smiled, nor bared his sword,"
2887,AN EPISODE,"But courteously drew back, and spoke, and said:--"
2888,AN EPISODE,"""Thou strik'st too hard! that club of thine will float"
2889,AN EPISODE,"Upon the summer-floods, and not my bones."
2890,AN EPISODE,"But rise, and be not wroth! not wroth am I;"
2891,AN EPISODE,"No, when I see thee, wrath forsakes my soul."
2892,AN EPISODE,"Thou say'st, thou art not Rustum; be it so!"
2893,AN EPISODE,"Who art thou then, that canst so touch my soul?"
2894,AN EPISODE,"Boy as I am, I have seen battles too--"
2895,AN EPISODE,"Have waded foremost in their bloody waves,"
2896,AN EPISODE,And heard their hollow roar of dying men;
2897,AN EPISODE,But never was my heart thus touch'd before.
2898,AN EPISODE,"Are they from Heaven, these softenings of the heart?"
2899,AN EPISODE,"O thou old warrior, let us yield to Heaven!"
2900,AN EPISODE,"Come, plant we here in earth our angry spears,"
2901,AN EPISODE,"And make a truce, and sit upon this sand,"
2902,AN EPISODE,"And pledge each other in red wine, like friends,"
2903,AN EPISODE,And thou shalt talk to me of Rustum's deeds.
2904,AN EPISODE,"There are enough foes in the Persian host,"
2905,AN EPISODE,"Whom I may meet, and strike, and feel no pang;"
2906,AN EPISODE,"Champions enough Afrasiab has, whom thou"
2907,AN EPISODE,"Mayst fight; fight _them_, when they confront thy spear!"
2908,AN EPISODE,"But oh, let there be peace 'twixt thee and me!"""
2909,AN EPISODE,"He ceased, but while he spake, Rustum had risen,"
2910,AN EPISODE,"And stood erect, trembling with rage; his club"
2911,AN EPISODE,"He left to lie, but had regain'd his spear,"
2912,AN EPISODE,Whose fiery point now in his mail'd right-hand
2913,AN EPISODE,"Blazed bright and baleful, like that autumn-star,"
2914,AN EPISODE,The baleful sign of fevers; dust had soil'd
2915,AN EPISODE,"His stately crest, and dimm'd his glittering arms."
2916,AN EPISODE,"His breast heaved, his lips foam'd, and twice his voice"
2917,AN EPISODE,Was choked with rage; at last these words broke way:--
2918,AN EPISODE,"""Girl! nimble with thy feet, not with thy hands!"
2919,AN EPISODE,"Curl'd minion, dancer, coiner of sweet words!"
2920,AN EPISODE,"Fight, let me hear thy hateful voice no more!"
2921,AN EPISODE,Thou art not in Afrasiab's gardens now
2922,AN EPISODE,"With Tartar girls, with whom thou art wont to dance;"
2923,AN EPISODE,"But on the Oxus-sands, and in the dance"
2924,AN EPISODE,"Of battle, and with me, who make no play"
2925,AN EPISODE,"Of war; I fight it out, and hand to hand."
2926,AN EPISODE,"Speak not to me of truce, and pledge, and wine!"
2927,AN EPISODE,Remember all thy valour; try thy feints
2928,AN EPISODE,And cunning! all the pity I had is gone;
2929,AN EPISODE,Because thou hast shamed me before both the hosts
2930,AN EPISODE,"With thy light skipping tricks, and thy girl's wiles."""
2931,AN EPISODE,"He spoke, and Sohrab kindled at his taunts,"
2932,AN EPISODE,And he too drew his sword; at once they rush'd
2933,AN EPISODE,"Together, as two eagles on one prey"
2934,AN EPISODE,"Come rushing down together from the clouds,"
2935,AN EPISODE,"One from the east, one from the west; their shields"
2936,AN EPISODE,"Dash'd with a clang together, and a din"
2937,AN EPISODE,"Rose, such as that the sinewy woodcutters"
2938,AN EPISODE,"Make often in the forest's heart at morn,"
2939,AN EPISODE,"Of hewing axes, crashing trees--such blows"
2940,AN EPISODE,Rustum and Sohrab on each other hail'd.
2941,AN EPISODE,And you would say that sun and stars took part
2942,AN EPISODE,In that unnatural conflict; for a cloud
2943,AN EPISODE,"Grew suddenly in Heaven, and dark'd the sun"
2944,AN EPISODE,Over the fighters' heads; and a wind rose
2945,AN EPISODE,"Under their feet, and moaning swept the plain,"
2946,AN EPISODE,And in a sandy whirlwind wrapp'd the pair.
2947,AN EPISODE,"In gloom they twain were wrapp'd, and they alone;"
2948,AN EPISODE,For both the on-looking hosts on either hand
2949,AN EPISODE,"Stood in broad daylight, and the sky was pure,"
2950,AN EPISODE,And the sun sparkled on the Oxus stream.
2951,AN EPISODE,"But in the gloom they fought, with bloodshot eyes"
2952,AN EPISODE,And labouring breath; first Rustum struck the shield
2953,AN EPISODE,Which Sohrab held stiff out; the steel-spiked spear
2954,AN EPISODE,"Rent the tough plates, but fail'd to reach the skin,"
2955,AN EPISODE,And Rustum pluck'd it back with angry groan.
2956,AN EPISODE,"Then Sohrab with his sword smote Rustum's helm,"
2957,AN EPISODE,Nor clove its steel quite through; but all the crest
2958,AN EPISODE,"He shore away, and that proud horsehair plume,"
2959,AN EPISODE,"Never till now defiled, sank to the dust;"
2960,AN EPISODE,And Rustum bow'd his head; but then the gloom
2961,AN EPISODE,"Grew blacker, thunder rumbled in the air,"
2962,AN EPISODE,"And lightnings rent the cloud; and Ruksh, the horse,"
2963,AN EPISODE,"Who stood at hand, utter'd a dreadful cry;--"
2964,AN EPISODE,"No horse's cry was that, most like the roar"
2965,AN EPISODE,"Of some pain'd desert-lion, who all day"
2966,AN EPISODE,"Hath trail'd the hunter's javelin in his side,"
2967,AN EPISODE,And comes at night to die upon the sand.
2968,AN EPISODE,"The two hosts heard that cry, and quaked for fear,"
2969,AN EPISODE,And Oxus curdled as it cross'd his stream.
2970,AN EPISODE,"But Sohrab heard, and quail'd not, but rush'd on,"
2971,AN EPISODE,And struck again; and again Rustum bow'd
2972,AN EPISODE,"His head; but this time all the blade, like glass,"
2973,AN EPISODE,"Sprang in a thousand shivers on the helm,"
2974,AN EPISODE,And in the hand the hilt remain'd alone.
2975,AN EPISODE,Then Rustum raised his head; his dreadful eyes
2976,AN EPISODE,"Glared, and he shook on high his menacing spear,"
2977,AN EPISODE,"And shouted: _Rustum!_--Sohrab heard that shout,"
2978,AN EPISODE,"And shrank amazed; back he recoil'd one step,"
2979,AN EPISODE,And scann'd with blinking eyes the advancing form;
2980,AN EPISODE,And then he stood bewilder'd; and he dropp'd
2981,AN EPISODE,"His covering shield, and the spear pierced his side."
2982,AN EPISODE,"He reel'd, and staggering back, sank to the ground;"
2983,AN EPISODE,"And then the gloom dispersed, and the wind fell,"
2984,AN EPISODE,"And the bright sun broke forth, and melted all"
2985,AN EPISODE,The cloud; and the two armies saw the pair--
2986,AN EPISODE,"Saw Rustum standing, safe upon his feet,"
2987,AN EPISODE,"And Sohrab, wounded, on the bloody sand."
2988,AN EPISODE,"Then, with a bitter smile, Rustum began:--"
2989,AN EPISODE,"""Sohrab, thou thoughtest in thy mind to kill"
2990,AN EPISODE,"A Persian lord this day, and strip his corpse,"
2991,AN EPISODE,And bear thy trophies to Afrasiab's tent.
2992,AN EPISODE,Or else that the great Rustum would come down
2993,AN EPISODE,"Himself to fight, and that thy wiles would move"
2994,AN EPISODE,"His heart to take a gift, and let thee go."
2995,AN EPISODE,And then that all the Tartar host would praise
2996,AN EPISODE,"Thy courage or thy craft, and spread thy fame,"
2997,AN EPISODE,To glad thy father in his weak old age.
2998,AN EPISODE,"Fool, thou art slain, and by an unknown man!"
2999,AN EPISODE,Dearer to the red jackals shalt thou be
3000,AN EPISODE,"Than to thy friends, and to thy father old."""
3001,AN EPISODE,"And, with a fearless mien, Sohrab replied:--"
3002,AN EPISODE,"""Unknown thou art; yet thy fierce vaunt is vain."
3003,AN EPISODE,"Thou dost not slay me, proud and boastful man!"
3004,AN EPISODE,"No! Rustum slays me, and this filial heart."
3005,AN EPISODE,"For were I match'd with ten such men as thee,"
3006,AN EPISODE,"And I were that which till to-day I was,"
3007,AN EPISODE,"They should be lying here, I standing there."
3008,AN EPISODE,But that belovéd name unnerved my arm--
3009,AN EPISODE,"That name, and something, I confess, in thee,"
3010,AN EPISODE,"Which troubles all my heart, and made my shield"
3011,AN EPISODE,Fall; and thy spear transfix'd an unarm'd foe.
3012,AN EPISODE,"And now thou boastest, and insult'st my fate."
3013,AN EPISODE,"But hear thou this, fierce man, tremble to hear:"
3014,AN EPISODE,The mighty Rustum shall avenge my death!
3015,AN EPISODE,"My father, whom I seek through all the world,"
3016,AN EPISODE,"He shall avenge my death, and punish thee!"""
3017,AN EPISODE,As when some hunter in the spring hath found
3018,AN EPISODE,"A breeding eagle sitting on her nest,"
3019,AN EPISODE,"Upon the craggy isle of a hill-lake,"
3020,AN EPISODE,"And pierced her with an arrow as she rose,"
3021,AN EPISODE,And follow'd her to find her where she fell
3022,AN EPISODE,Far off;--anon her mate comes winging back
3023,AN EPISODE,"From hunting, and a great way off descries"
3024,AN EPISODE,"His huddling young left sole; at that, he checks"
3025,AN EPISODE,"His pinion, and with short uneasy sweeps"
3026,AN EPISODE,"Circles above his eyry, with loud screams"
3027,AN EPISODE,Chiding his mate back to her nest; but she
3028,AN EPISODE,"Lies dying, with the arrow in her side,"
3029,AN EPISODE,"In some far stony gorge out of his ken,"
3030,AN EPISODE,A heap of fluttering feathers--never more
3031,AN EPISODE,"Shall the lake glass her, flying over it;"
3032,AN EPISODE,Never the black and dripping precipices
3033,AN EPISODE,Echo her stormy scream as she sails by--
3034,AN EPISODE,"As that poor bird flies home, nor knows his loss,"
3035,AN EPISODE,"So Rustum knew not his own loss, but stood"
3036,AN EPISODE,"Over his dying son, and knew him not."
3037,AN EPISODE,"But, with a cold incredulous voice, he said:--"
3038,AN EPISODE,"""What prate is this of fathers and revenge?"
3039,AN EPISODE,"The mighty Rustum never had a son."""
3040,AN EPISODE,"And, with a failing voice, Sohrab replied:--"
3041,AN EPISODE,"""Ah yes, he had! and that lost son am I."
3042,AN EPISODE,"Surely the news will one day reach his ear,"
3043,AN EPISODE,"Reach Rustum, where he sits, and tarries long,"
3044,AN EPISODE,"Somewhere, I know not where, but far from here;"
3045,AN EPISODE,"And pierce him like a stab, and make him leap"
3046,AN EPISODE,"To arms, and cry for vengeance upon thee."
3047,AN EPISODE,"Fierce man, bethink thee, for an only son!"
3048,AN EPISODE,"What will that grief, what will that vengeance be?"
3049,AN EPISODE,"Oh, could I live, till I that grief had seen!"
3050,AN EPISODE,"Yet him I pity not so much, but her,"
3051,AN EPISODE,"My mother, who in Ader-baijan dwells"
3052,AN EPISODE,"With that old king, her father, who grows grey"
3053,AN EPISODE,"With age, and rules over the valiant Koords."
3054,AN EPISODE,"Her most I pity, who no more will see"
3055,AN EPISODE,"Sohrab returning from the Tartar camp,"
3056,AN EPISODE,"With spoils and honour, when the war is done."
3057,AN EPISODE,"But a dark rumour will be bruited up,"
3058,AN EPISODE,"From tribe to tribe, until it reach her ear;"
3059,AN EPISODE,And then will that defenceless woman learn
3060,AN EPISODE,"That Sohrab will rejoice her sight no more,"
3061,AN EPISODE,"But that in battle with a nameless foe,"
3062,AN EPISODE,"By the far-distant Oxus, he is slain."""
3063,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; and as he ceased, he wept aloud,"
3064,AN EPISODE,"Thinking of her he left, and his own death."
3065,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; but Rustum listen'd, plunged in thought."
3066,AN EPISODE,Nor did he yet believe it was his son
3067,AN EPISODE,"Who spoke, although he call'd back names he knew;"
3068,AN EPISODE,"For he had had sure tidings that the babe,"
3069,AN EPISODE,"Which was in Ader-baijan born to him,"
3070,AN EPISODE,"Had been a puny girl, no boy at all--"
3071,AN EPISODE,"So that sad mother sent him word, for fear"
3072,AN EPISODE,"Rustum should seek the boy, to train in arms"
3073,AN EPISODE,"And so he deem'd that either Sohrab took,"
3074,AN EPISODE,"By a false boast, the style of Rustum's son;"
3075,AN EPISODE,"Or that men gave it him, to swell his fame."
3076,AN EPISODE,"So deem'd he; yet he listen'd, plunged in thought"
3077,AN EPISODE,"And his soul set to grief, as the vast tide"
3078,AN EPISODE,Of the bright rocking Ocean sets to shore
3079,AN EPISODE,At the full moon; tears gather'd in his eyes;
3080,AN EPISODE,"For he remember'd his own early youth,"
3081,AN EPISODE,"And all its bounding rapture; as, at dawn,"
3082,AN EPISODE,The shepherd from his mountain-lodge descries
3083,AN EPISODE,"A far, bright city, smitten by the sun,"
3084,AN EPISODE,Through many rolling clouds--so Rustum saw
3085,AN EPISODE,"His youth; saw Sohrab's mother, in her bloom;"
3086,AN EPISODE,"And that old king, her father, who loved well"
3087,AN EPISODE,"His wandering guest, and gave him his fair child"
3088,AN EPISODE,"With joy; and all the pleasant life they led,"
3089,AN EPISODE,"They three, in that long-distant summer-time--"
3090,AN EPISODE,"The castle, and the dewy woods, and hunt"
3091,AN EPISODE,"And hound, and morn on those delightful hills"
3092,AN EPISODE,"In Ader-baijan. And he saw that Youth,"
3093,AN EPISODE,"Of age and looks to be his own dear son,"
3094,AN EPISODE,"Piteous and lovely, lying on the sand,"
3095,AN EPISODE,Like some rich hyacinth which by the scythe
3096,AN EPISODE,"Of an unskilful gardener has been cut,"
3097,AN EPISODE,"Mowing the garden grass-plots near its bed,"
3098,AN EPISODE,"And lies, a fragrant tower of purple bloom,"
3099,AN EPISODE,"On the mown, dying grass--so Sohrab lay,"
3100,AN EPISODE,"Lovely in death, upon the common sand."
3101,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum gazed on him with grief, and said:--"
3102,AN EPISODE,"""O Sohrab, thou indeed art such a son"
3103,AN EPISODE,"Whom Rustum, wert thou his, might well have loved."
3104,AN EPISODE,"Yet here thou errest, Sohrab, or else men"
3105,AN EPISODE,Have told thee false--thou art not Rustum's son.
3106,AN EPISODE,For Rustum had no son; one child he had--
3107,AN EPISODE,But one--a girl; who with her mother now
3108,AN EPISODE,"Plies some light female task, nor dreams of us--"
3109,AN EPISODE,"Of us she dreams not, nor of wounds, nor war."""
3110,AN EPISODE,But Sohrab answer'd him in wrath; for now
3111,AN EPISODE,"The anguish of the deep-fix'd spear grew fierce,"
3112,AN EPISODE,"And he desired to draw forth the steel,"
3113,AN EPISODE,"And let the blood flow free, and so to die--"
3114,AN EPISODE,But first he would convince his stubborn foe;
3115,AN EPISODE,"And, rising sternly on one arm, he said:--"
3116,AN EPISODE,"""Man, who art thou who dost deny my words?"
3117,AN EPISODE,"Truth sits upon the lips of dying men,"
3118,AN EPISODE,"And falsehood, while I lived, was far from mine."
3119,AN EPISODE,"I tell thee, prick'd upon this arm I bear"
3120,AN EPISODE,"That seal which Rustum to my mother gave,"
3121,AN EPISODE,"That she might prick it on the babe she bore."""
3122,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; and all the blood left Rustum's cheeks,"
3123,AN EPISODE,"And his knees totter'd, and he smote his hand"
3124,AN EPISODE,"Against his breast, his heavy mailed hand,"
3125,AN EPISODE,That the hard iron corslet clank'd aloud;
3126,AN EPISODE,"And to his heart he press'd the other hand,"
3127,AN EPISODE,"And in a hollow voice he spake, and said:--"
3128,AN EPISODE,"""Sohrab, that were a proof which could not lie!"
3129,AN EPISODE,"If thou show this, then art thou Rustum's son."""
3130,AN EPISODE,"Then, with weak hasty fingers, Sohrab loosed"
3131,AN EPISODE,"His belt, and near the shoulder bared his arm,"
3132,AN EPISODE,And show'd a sign in faint vermilion points
3133,AN EPISODE,"Prick'd; as a cunning workman, in Pekin,"
3134,AN EPISODE,"Pricks with vermilion some clear porcelain vase,"
3135,AN EPISODE,"An emperor's gift--at early morn he paints,"
3136,AN EPISODE,"And all day long, and, when night comes, the lamp"
3137,AN EPISODE,Lights up his studious forehead and thin hands--
3138,AN EPISODE,So delicately prick'd the sign appear'd
3139,AN EPISODE,"On Sohrab's arm, the sign of Rustum's seal."
3140,AN EPISODE,"It was that griffin, which of old rear'd Zal,"
3141,AN EPISODE,"Rustum's great father, whom they left to die,"
3142,AN EPISODE,"A helpless babe, among the mountain-rocks;"
3143,AN EPISODE,"Him that kind creature found, and rear'd, and loved--"
3144,AN EPISODE,Then Rustum took it for his glorious sign.
3145,AN EPISODE,"And Sohrab bared that image on his arm,"
3146,AN EPISODE,"And himself scann'd it long with mournful eyes,"
3147,AN EPISODE,And then he touch'd it with his hand and said:--
3148,AN EPISODE,"""How say'st thou? Is that sign the proper sign"
3149,AN EPISODE,"Of Rustum's son, or of some other man's?"""
3150,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; but Rustum gazed, and gazed, and stood"
3151,AN EPISODE,Speechless; and then he utter'd one sharp cry:
3152,AN EPISODE,_O boy--thy father!_--and his voice choked there.
3153,AN EPISODE,"And then a dark cloud pass'd before his eyes,"
3154,AN EPISODE,"And his head swam, and he sank down to earth."
3155,AN EPISODE,"But Sohrab crawl'd to where he lay, and cast"
3156,AN EPISODE,"His arms about his neck, and kiss'd his lips,"
3157,AN EPISODE,"And with fond faltering fingers stroked his cheeks,"
3158,AN EPISODE,Trying to call him back to life; and life
3159,AN EPISODE,"Came back to Rustum, and he oped his eyes,"
3160,AN EPISODE,And they stood wide with horror; and he seized
3161,AN EPISODE,"In both his hands the dust which lay around,"
3162,AN EPISODE,"And threw it on his head, and smirch'd his hair,--"
3163,AN EPISODE,"His hair, and face, and beard, and glittering arms;"
3164,AN EPISODE,"And strong convulsive groanings shook his breast,"
3165,AN EPISODE,"And his sobs choked him; and he clutch'd his sword,"
3166,AN EPISODE,"To draw it, and for ever let life out."
3167,AN EPISODE,"But Sohrab saw his thought, and held his hands,"
3168,AN EPISODE,"And with a soothing voice he spake, and said:--"
3169,AN EPISODE,"""Father, forbear! for I but meet to-day"
3170,AN EPISODE,The doom which at my birth was written down
3171,AN EPISODE,"In Heaven, and thou art Heaven's unconscious hand."
3172,AN EPISODE,"Surely my heart cried out that it was thou,"
3173,AN EPISODE,"When first I saw thee; and thy heart spoke too,"
3174,AN EPISODE,I know it! but fate trod those promptings down
3175,AN EPISODE,"Under its iron heel; fate, fate engaged"
3176,AN EPISODE,"The strife, and hurl'd me on my father's spear."
3177,AN EPISODE,But let us speak no more of this! I find
3178,AN EPISODE,My father; let me feel that I have found!
3179,AN EPISODE,"Come, sit beside me on this sand, and take"
3180,AN EPISODE,"My head betwixt thy hands, and kiss my cheeks,"
3181,AN EPISODE,"And wash them with thy tears, and say: _My son!_"
3182,AN EPISODE,"Quick! quick! for number'd are my sands of life,"
3183,AN EPISODE,And swift; for like the lightning to this field
3184,AN EPISODE,"I came, and like the wind I go away--"
3185,AN EPISODE,"Sudden, and swift, and like a passing wind."
3186,AN EPISODE,"But it was writ in Heaven that this should be."""
3187,AN EPISODE,"So said he, and his voice released the heart"
3188,AN EPISODE,"Of Rustum, and his tears broke forth; he cast"
3189,AN EPISODE,"His arms round his son's neck, and wept aloud,"
3190,AN EPISODE,"And kiss'd him. And awe fell on both the hosts,"
3191,AN EPISODE,"When they saw Rustum's grief; and Ruksh, the horse,"
3192,AN EPISODE,With his head bowing to the ground and mane
3193,AN EPISODE,"Sweeping the dust, came near, and in mute woe"
3194,AN EPISODE,First to the one then to the other moved
3195,AN EPISODE,"His head, as if inquiring what their grief"
3196,AN EPISODE,"Might mean; and from his dark, compassionate eyes,"
3197,AN EPISODE,"The big warm tears roll'd down, and caked the sand."
3198,AN EPISODE,"But Rustum chid him with stern voice, and said:--"
3199,AN EPISODE,"""Ruksh, now thou grievest; but, O Ruksh, thy feet"
3200,AN EPISODE,"Should first have rotted on their nimble joints,"
3201,AN EPISODE,"Or ere they brought thy master to this field!"""
3202,AN EPISODE,But Sohrab look'd upon the horse and said;--
3203,AN EPISODE,"""Is this, then, Ruksh? How often, in past days,"
3204,AN EPISODE,"My mother told me of thee, thou brave steed,"
3205,AN EPISODE,"My terrible father's terrible horse! and said,"
3206,AN EPISODE,That I should one day find thy lord and thee.
3207,AN EPISODE,"Come, let me lay my hand upon thy mane!"
3208,AN EPISODE,"O Ruksh, thou art more fortunate than I;"
3209,AN EPISODE,"For thou hast gone where I shall never go,"
3210,AN EPISODE,And snuff'd the breezes of my father's home.
3211,AN EPISODE,"And thou hast trod the sands of Seistan,"
3212,AN EPISODE,"And seen the River of Helmund, and the Lake"
3213,AN EPISODE,Of Zirrah; and the aged Zal himself
3214,AN EPISODE,"Has often stroked thy neck, and given thee food,"
3215,AN EPISODE,"Corn in a golden platter soak'd with wine,"
3216,AN EPISODE,And said; _O Ruksh! bear Rustum well!_--but I
3217,AN EPISODE,"Have never known my grandsire's furrow'd face,"
3218,AN EPISODE,"Nor seen his lofty house in Seistan,"
3219,AN EPISODE,Nor slaked my thirst at the clear Helmund stream;
3220,AN EPISODE,"But lodged among my father's foes, and seen"
3221,AN EPISODE,"Afrasiab's cities only, Samarcand,"
3222,AN EPISODE,"Bokhara, and lone Khiva in the waste,"
3223,AN EPISODE,And the black Toorkmun tents; and only drunk
3224,AN EPISODE,"The desert rivers, Moorghab and Tejend,"
3225,AN EPISODE,"Kohik, and where the Kalmuks feed their sheep,"
3226,AN EPISODE,"The northern Sir; and this great Oxus stream,"
3227,AN EPISODE,"The yellow Oxus, by whose brink I die."""
3228,AN EPISODE,"Then, with a heavy groan, Rustum bewail'd:--"
3229,AN EPISODE,"""Oh, that its waves were flowing over me!"
3230,AN EPISODE,"Oh, that I saw its grains of yellow silt"
3231,AN EPISODE,"Roll tumbling in the current o'er my head!"""
3232,AN EPISODE,"But, with a grave mild voice, Sohrab replied:--"
3233,AN EPISODE,"""Desire not that, my father! thou must live."
3234,AN EPISODE,"For some are born to do great deeds, and live,"
3235,AN EPISODE,"As some are born to be obscured, and die."
3236,AN EPISODE,"Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,"
3237,AN EPISODE,And reap a second glory in thine age;
3238,AN EPISODE,"Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine."
3239,AN EPISODE,But come! thou seest this great host of men
3240,AN EPISODE,"Which follow me; I pray thee, slay not these!"
3241,AN EPISODE,Let me entreat for them; what have they done?
3242,AN EPISODE,"They follow'd me, my hope, my fame, my star."
3243,AN EPISODE,Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace.
3244,AN EPISODE,"But me thou must bear hence, not send with them,"
3245,AN EPISODE,"But carry me with thee to Seistan,"
3246,AN EPISODE,"And place me on a bed, and mourn for me,"
3247,AN EPISODE,"Thou, and the snow-hair'd Zal, and all thy friends."
3248,AN EPISODE,"And thou must lay me in that lovely earth,"
3249,AN EPISODE,"And heap a stately mound above my bones,"
3250,AN EPISODE,And plant a far-seen pillar over all.
3251,AN EPISODE,That so the passing horseman on the waste
3252,AN EPISODE,"May see my tomb a great way off, and cry:"
3253,AN EPISODE,"_Sohrab, the mighty Rustum's son, lies there,_"
3254,AN EPISODE,_Whom his great father did in ignorance kill!_
3255,AN EPISODE,"And I be not forgotten in my grave."""
3256,AN EPISODE,"And, with a mournful voice, Rustum replied:--"
3257,AN EPISODE,"""Fear not! as thou hast said, Sohrab, my son,"
3258,AN EPISODE,"So shall it be; for I will burn my tents,"
3259,AN EPISODE,"And quit the host, and bear thee hence with me,"
3260,AN EPISODE,"And carry thee away to Seistan,"
3261,AN EPISODE,"And place thee on a bed, and mourn for thee,"
3262,AN EPISODE,"With the snow-headed Zal, and all my friends."
3263,AN EPISODE,"And I will lay thee in that lovely earth,"
3264,AN EPISODE,"And heap a stately mound above thy bones,"
3265,AN EPISODE,"And plant a far-seen pillar over all,"
3266,AN EPISODE,And men shall not forget thee in thy grave.
3267,AN EPISODE,"And I will spare thy host; yea, let them go!"
3268,AN EPISODE,Let them all cross the Oxus back in peace!
3269,AN EPISODE,What should I do with slaying any more?
3270,AN EPISODE,For would that all that I have ever slain
3271,AN EPISODE,"Might be once more alive; my bitterest foes,"
3272,AN EPISODE,"And they who were call'd champions in their time,"
3273,AN EPISODE,And through whose death I won that fame I have--
3274,AN EPISODE,"And I were nothing but a common man,"
3275,AN EPISODE,"A poor, mean soldier, and without renown,"
3276,AN EPISODE,"So thou mightest live too, my son, my son!"
3277,AN EPISODE,"Or rather would that I, even I myself,"
3278,AN EPISODE,"Might now be lying on this bloody sand,"
3279,AN EPISODE,"Near death, and by an ignorant stroke of thine,"
3280,AN EPISODE,"Not thou of mine! and I might die, not thou;"
3281,AN EPISODE,"And I, not thou, be borne to Seistan;"
3282,AN EPISODE,"And Zal might weep above my grave, not thine;"
3283,AN EPISODE,"And say: _O son, I weep thee not too sore,_"
3284,AN EPISODE,"_For willingly, I know, thou met'st thine end!_"
3285,AN EPISODE,"But now in blood and battles was my youth,"
3286,AN EPISODE,"And full of blood and battles is my age,"
3287,AN EPISODE,"And I shall never end this life of blood."""
3288,AN EPISODE,"Then, at the point of death, Sohrab replied:--"
3289,AN EPISODE,"""A life of blood indeed, thou dreadful man!"
3290,AN EPISODE,"But thou shalt yet have peace; only not now,"
3291,AN EPISODE,"Not yet! but thou shalt have it on that day,"
3292,AN EPISODE,"When thou shalt sail in a high-masted ship,"
3293,AN EPISODE,"Thou and the other peers of Kai Khosroo,"
3294,AN EPISODE,"Returning home over the salt blue sea,"
3295,AN EPISODE,"From laying thy dear master in his grave."""
3296,AN EPISODE,"And Rustum gazed in Sohrab's face, and said:--"
3297,AN EPISODE,"""Soon be that day, my son, and deep that sea!"
3298,AN EPISODE,"Till then, if fate so wills, let me endure."""
3299,AN EPISODE,"He spoke; and Sohrab smiled on him, and took"
3300,AN EPISODE,"The spear, and drew it from his side, and eased"
3301,AN EPISODE,His wound's imperious anguish; but the blood
3302,AN EPISODE,"Came welling from the open gash, and life"
3303,AN EPISODE,Flow'd with the stream;--all down his cold white side
3304,AN EPISODE,"The crimson torrent ran, dim now and soil'd,"
3305,AN EPISODE,Like the soil'd tissue of white violets
3306,AN EPISODE,"Left, freshly gather'd, on their native bank,"
3307,AN EPISODE,By children whom their nurses call with haste
3308,AN EPISODE,"Indoors from the sun's eye; his head droop'd low,"
3309,AN EPISODE,"His limbs grew slack; motionless, white, he lay--"
3310,AN EPISODE,"White, with eyes closed; only when heavy gasps,"
3311,AN EPISODE,"Deep heavy gasps quivering through all his frame,"
3312,AN EPISODE,"Convulsed him back to life, he open'd them,"
3313,AN EPISODE,And fix'd them feebly on his father's face;
3314,AN EPISODE,"Till now all strength was ebb'd, and from his limbs"
3315,AN EPISODE,"Unwillingly the spirit fled away,"
3316,AN EPISODE,"Regretting the warm mansion which it left,"
3317,AN EPISODE,"And youth, and bloom, and this delightful world."
3318,AN EPISODE,"So, on the bloody sand, Sohrab lay dead;"
3319,AN EPISODE,And the great Rustum drew his horseman's cloak
3320,AN EPISODE,"Down o'er his face, and sate by his dead son."
3321,AN EPISODE,"As those black granite pillars, once high-rear'd"
3322,AN EPISODE,"By Jemshid in Persepolis, to bear"
3323,AN EPISODE,"His house, now 'mid their broken flights of steps"
3324,AN EPISODE,"Lie prone, enormous, down the mountain side--"
3325,AN EPISODE,So in the sand lay Rustum by his son.
3326,AN EPISODE,"And night came down over the solemn waste,"
3327,AN EPISODE,"And the two gazing hosts, and that sole pair,"
3328,AN EPISODE,"And darken'd all; and a cold fog, with night,"
3329,AN EPISODE,"Crept from the Oxus. Soon a hum arose,"
3330,AN EPISODE,"As of a great assembly loosed, and fires"
3331,AN EPISODE,Began to twinkle through the fog; for now
3332,AN EPISODE,"Both armies moved to camp, and took their meal;"
3333,AN EPISODE,The Persians took it on the open sands
3334,AN EPISODE,"Southward, the Tartars by the river marge;"
3335,AN EPISODE,And Rustum and his son were left alone.
3336,AN EPISODE,"But the majestic river floated on,"
3337,AN EPISODE,"Out of the mist and hum of that low land,"
3338,AN EPISODE,"Into the frosty starlight, and there moved,"
3339,AN EPISODE,"Rejoicing, through the hush'd Chorasmian waste,"
3340,AN EPISODE,Under the solitary moon;--he flow'd
3341,AN EPISODE,"Right for the polar star, past Orgunjè,"
3342,AN EPISODE,"Brimming, and bright, and large; then sands begin"
3343,AN EPISODE,"To hem his watery march, and dam his streams,"
3344,AN EPISODE,And split his currents; that for many a league
3345,AN EPISODE,The shorn and parcell'd Oxus strains along
3346,AN EPISODE,Through beds of sand and matted rushy isles--
3347,AN EPISODE,"Oxus, forgetting the bright speed he had"
3348,AN EPISODE,"In his high mountain-cradle in Pamere,"
3349,AN EPISODE,A foil'd circuitous wanderer--till at last
3350,AN EPISODE,"The long'd-for dash of waves is heard, and wide"
3351,AN EPISODE,"His luminous home of waters opens, bright"
3352,AN EPISODE,"And tranquil, from whose floor the new-bathed stars"
3353,AN EPISODE,"Emerge, and shine upon the Aral Sea."

3405,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Wherefore, that I may counsel thee,"
3406,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Let Hussein, if thou wilt, make haste"
3407,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,To speak in order what hath chanced.

3415,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,_Hussein_
3416,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3417,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Three days since, at the time of prayer"
3418,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"A certain Moollah, with his robe"
3419,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"All rent, and dust upon his hair,"
3420,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Watch'd my lord's coming forth, and push'd"
3421,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"The golden mace-bearers aside,"
3422,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And fell at the King's feet, and cried:"
3423,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3424,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""Justice, O King, and on myself!"
3425,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"On this great sinner, who did break"
3426,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"The law, and by the law must die!"
3427,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Vengeance, O King!"""
3428,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3429,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,But the King spake:
3430,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""What fool is this, that hurts our ears"
3431,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,With folly? or what drunken slave?
3432,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"My guards, what, prick him with your spears!"
3433,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Prick me the fellow from the path!"""
3434,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"As the King said, so it was done,"
3435,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,And to the mosque my lord pass'd on.
3436,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3437,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But on the morrow, when the King"
3438,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Went forth again, the holy book"
3439,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Carried before him, as is right,"
3440,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,And through the square his way he took;
3441,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"My man comes running, fleck'd with blood"
3442,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"From yesterday, and falling down"
3443,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Cries out most earnestly: ""O King,"
3444,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"My lord, O King, do right, I pray!"
3445,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3446,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""How canst thou, ere thou hear, discern"
3447,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"If I speak folly? but a king,"
3448,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Whether a thing be great or small,"
3449,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Like Allah, hears and judges all."
3450,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3451,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""Wherefore hear thou! Thou know'st, how fierce"
3452,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,In these last days the sun hath burn'd;
3453,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,That the green water in the tanks
3454,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Is to a putrid puddle turn'd;
3455,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And the canal, which from the stream"
3456,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Of Samarcand is brought this way,"
3457,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Wastes, and runs thinner every day."
3458,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3459,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""Now I at nightfall had gone forth"
3460,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Alone, and in a darksome place"
3461,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Under some mulberry-trees I found
3462,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"A little pool; and in short space,"
3463,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,With all the water that was there
3464,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"I fill'd my pitcher, and stole home"
3465,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Unseen; and having drink to spare,"
3466,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"I hid the can behind the door,"
3467,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,And went up on the roof to sleep.
3468,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3469,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""But in the night, which was with wind"
3470,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And burning dust, again I creep"
3471,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Down, having fever, for a drink."
3472,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3473,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""Now meanwhile had my brethren found"
3474,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"The water-pitcher, where it stood"
3475,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Behind the door upon the ground,"
3476,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And call'd my mother; and they all,"
3477,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"As they were thirsty, and the night"
3478,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Most sultry, drain'd the pitcher there;"
3479,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"That they sate with it, in my sight,"
3480,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Their lips still wet, when I came down."
3481,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3482,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""Now mark! I, being fever'd, sick"
3483,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"(Most unblest also), at that sight"
3484,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Brake forth, and cursed them--dost thou hear?--"
3485,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"One was my mother----Now, do right!"""
3486,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3487,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But my lord mused a space, and said:"
3488,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""Send him away, Sirs, and make on!"
3489,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"It is some madman!"" the King said."
3490,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"As the King bade, so was it done."
3491,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3492,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"The morrow, at the self-same hour,"
3493,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"In the King's path, behold, the man,"
3494,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Not kneeling, sternly fix'd! he stood"
3495,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Right opposite, and thus began,"
3496,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Frowning grim down: ""Thou wicked King,"
3497,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Most deaf where thou shouldst most give ear!
3498,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"What, must I howl in the next world,"
3499,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Because thou wilt not listen here?
3500,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3501,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""What, wilt thou pray, and get thee grace,"
3502,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,And all grace shall to me be grudged?
3503,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Nay but, I swear, from this thy path"
3504,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"I will not stir till I be judged!"""
3505,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3506,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Then they who stood about the King
3507,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Drew close together and conferr'd;
3508,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Till that the King stood forth and said:
3509,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""Before the priests thou shalt be heard."""
3510,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3511,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But when the Ulemas were met,"
3512,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And the thing heard, they doubted not;"
3513,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But sentenced him, as the law is,"
3514,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,To die by stoning on the spot.
3515,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3516,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Now the King charged us secretly:
3517,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""Stoned must he be, the law stands so."
3518,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Yet, if he seek to fly, give way;"
3519,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Hinder him not, but let him go."""
3520,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3521,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"So saying, the King took a stone,"
3522,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And cast it softly;--but the man,"
3523,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"With a great joy upon his face,"
3524,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Kneel'd down, and cried not, neither ran."
3525,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3526,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"So they, whose lot it was, cast stones,"
3527,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,That they flew thick and bruised him sore.
3528,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But he praised Allah with loud voice,"
3529,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,And remain'd kneeling as before.
3530,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3531,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,My lord had cover'd up his face;
3532,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But when one told him, ""He is dead,"""
3533,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Turning him quickly to go in,"
3534,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""Bring thou to me his corpse,"" he said."
3535,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3536,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And truly, while I speak, O King,"
3537,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,I hear the bearers on the stair;
3538,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Wilt thou they straightway bring him in?
3539,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,--Ho! enter ye who tarry there!
3540,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3541,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3542,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,_The Vizier_
3543,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3544,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"O King, in this I praise thee not!"
3545,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Now must I call thy grief not wise.
3546,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Is he thy friend, or of thy blood,"
3547,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,To find such favour in thine eyes?
3548,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3549,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Nay, were he thine own mother's son,"
3550,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Still, thou art king, and the law stands."
3551,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"It were not meet the balance swerved,"
3552,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,The sword were broken in thy hands.
3553,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3554,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But being nothing, as he is,"
3555,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Why for no cause make sad thy face?--
3556,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Lo, I am old! three kings, ere thee,"
3557,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Have I seen reigning in this place.
3558,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3559,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But who, through all this length of time,"
3560,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Could bear the burden of his years,"
3561,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,If he for strangers pain'd his heart
3562,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Not less than those who merit tears?
3563,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3564,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Fathers we _must_ have, wife and child,"
3565,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,And grievous is the grief for these;
3566,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"This pain alone, which _must_ be borne,"
3567,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Makes the head white, and bows the knees."
3568,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3569,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,But other loads than this his own
3570,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,One man is not well made to bear.
3571,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Besides, to each are his own friends,"
3572,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"To mourn with him, and show him care."
3573,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3574,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Look, this is but one single place,"
3575,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Though it be great; all the earth round,"
3576,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"If a man bear to have it so,"
3577,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Things which might vex him shall be found.
3578,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3579,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Upon the Russian frontier, where"
3580,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,The watchers of two armies stand
3581,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Near one another, many a man,"
3582,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Seeking a prey unto his hand,"
3583,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3584,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Hath snatch'd a little fair-hair'd slave;
3585,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"They snatch also, towards Mervè,"
3586,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"The Shiah dogs, who pasture sheep,"
3587,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,And up from thence to Orgunjè.
3588,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3589,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And these all, labouring for a lord,"
3590,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Eat not the fruit of their own hands;
3591,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Which is the heaviest of all plagues,"
3592,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"To that man's mind, who understands."
3593,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3594,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,The kaffirs also (whom God curse!)
3595,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Vex one another, night and day;"
3596,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"There are the lepers, and all sick;"
3597,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"There are the poor, who faint alway"
3598,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"All these have sorrow, and keep still,"
3599,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Whilst other men make cheer, and sing."
3600,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Wilt thou have pity on all these?
3601,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"No, nor on this dead dog, O King!"
3602,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3603,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3604,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,_The King_
3605,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3606,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"O Vizier, thou art old, I young!"
3607,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Clear in these things I cannot see.
3608,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"My head is burning, and a heat"
3609,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Is in my skin which angers me.
3610,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3611,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But hear ye this, ye sons of men!"
3612,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"They that bear rule, and are obey'd,"
3613,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Unto a rule more strong than theirs
3614,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,Are in their turn obedient made.
3615,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3616,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"In vain therefore, with wistful eyes"
3617,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Gazing up hither, the poor man,"
3618,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Who loiters by the high-heap'd booths,"
3619,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Below there, in the Registàn,"
3620,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3621,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Says: ""Happy he, who lodges there!"
3622,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"With silken raiment, store of rice,"
3623,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And for this drought, all kinds of fruits,"
3624,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Grape-syrup, squares of colour'd ice,"
3625,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3626,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"""With cherries serv'd in drifts of snow."""
3627,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,In vain hath a king power to build
3628,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Houses, arcades, enamell'd mosques;"
3629,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And to make orchard-closes, fill'd"
3630,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3631,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,With curious fruit-trees brought from far
3632,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"With cisterns for the winter-rain,"

3634,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,In divers places--if that pain
3635,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Is not more lighten'd, which he feels,"
3636,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,If his will be not satisfied;
3637,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And that it be not, from all time"
3638,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"The law is planted, to abide."

3642,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"That, though we take what we desire,"
3643,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,We must not snatch it eagerly.
3644,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3645,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And I have meat and drink at will,"
3646,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And rooms of treasures, not a few."
3647,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But I am sick, nor heed I these;"
3648,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"And what I would, I cannot do."
3649,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3650,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"Even the great honour which I have,"
3651,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"When I am dead, will soon grow still;"

3653,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,"But what I can do, that I will."
3654,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,
3655,THE SICK KING IN BOKHARA,I have a fretted brick-work tomb

3676,I. SENDING,I. SENDING
3677,I. SENDING,
3678,I. SENDING,So on the floor lay Balder dead; and round
3679,I. SENDING,"Lay thickly strewn swords, axes, darts, and spears,"
3680,I. SENDING,Which all the Gods in sport had idly thrown
3681,I. SENDING,"At Balder, whom no weapon pierced or clove;"
3682,I. SENDING,But in his breast stood fixt the fatal bough
3683,I. SENDING,"Of mistletoe, which Lok the Accuser gave"
3684,I. SENDING,"To Hoder, and unwitting Hoder threw--"
3685,I. SENDING,'Gainst that alone had Balder's life no charm.
3686,I. SENDING,"And all the Gods and all the Heroes came,"
3687,I. SENDING,"And stood round Balder on the bloody floor,"
3688,I. SENDING,Weeping and wailing; and Valhalla rang
3689,I. SENDING,Up to its golden roof with sobs and cries;
3690,I. SENDING,"And on the tables stood the untasted meats,"
3691,I. SENDING,And in the horns and gold-rimm'd skulls the wine.
3692,I. SENDING,"And now would night have fall'n, and found them yet"
3693,I. SENDING,Wailing; but otherwise was Odin's will.
3694,I. SENDING,And thus the father of the ages spake:--
3695,I. SENDING,"""Enough of tears, ye Gods, enough of wail!"
3696,I. SENDING,Not to lament in was Valhalla made.
3697,I. SENDING,"If any here might weep for Balder's death,"
3698,I. SENDING,"I most might weep, his father; such a son"
3699,I. SENDING,"I lose to-day, so bright, so loved a God."
3700,I. SENDING,"But he has met that doom, which long ago"
3701,I. SENDING,"The Nornies, when his mother bare him, spun,"
3702,I. SENDING,"And fate set seal, that so his end must be."
3703,I. SENDING,"Balder has met his death, and ye survive--"
3704,I. SENDING,"Weep him an hour, but what can grief avail?"
3705,I. SENDING,"For ye yourselves, ye Gods, shall meet your doom,"
3706,I. SENDING,"All ye who hear me, and inhabit Heaven,"
3707,I. SENDING,"And I too, Odin too, the Lord of all."
3708,I. SENDING,"But ours we shall not meet, when that day comes,"
3709,I. SENDING,With women's tears and weak complaining cries--
3710,I. SENDING,Why should we meet another's portion so?
3711,I. SENDING,"Rather it fits you, having wept your hour,"
3712,I. SENDING,"With cold dry eyes, and hearts composed and stern,"
3713,I. SENDING,"To live, as erst, your daily life in Heaven."
3714,I. SENDING,"By me shall vengeance on the murderer Lok,"
3715,I. SENDING,"The foe, the accuser, whom, though Gods, we hate,"
3716,I. SENDING,"Be strictly cared for, in the appointed day."
3717,I. SENDING,"Meanwhile, to-morrow, when the morning dawns,"
3718,I. SENDING,"Bring wood to the seashore to Balder's ship,"
3719,I. SENDING,"And on the deck build high a funeral-pile,"
3720,I. SENDING,"And on the top lay Balder's corpse, and put"
3721,I. SENDING,"Fire to the wood, and send him out to sea"
3722,I. SENDING,"To burn; for that is what the dead desire."""
3723,I. SENDING,"So spake the King of Gods, and straightway rose,"
3724,I. SENDING,"And mounted his horse Sleipner, whom he rode;"
3725,I. SENDING,And from the hall of Heaven he rode away
3726,I. SENDING,"To Lidskialf, and sate upon his throne,"
3727,I. SENDING,"The mount, from whence his eye surveys the world."
3728,I. SENDING,And far from Heaven he turn'd his shining orbs
3729,I. SENDING,"To look on Midgard, and the earth, and men."
3730,I. SENDING,And on the conjuring Lapps he bent his gaze
3731,I. SENDING,Whom antler'd reindeer pull over the snow;
3732,I. SENDING,"And on the Finns, the gentlest of mankind,"
3733,I. SENDING,"Fair men, who live in holes under the ground;"
3734,I. SENDING,"Nor did he look once more to Ida's plain,"
3735,I. SENDING,"Nor tow'rd Valhalla, and the sorrowing Gods;"
3736,I. SENDING,"For well he knew the Gods would heed his word,"
3737,I. SENDING,"And cease to mourn, and think of Balder's pyre."
3738,I. SENDING,But in Valhalla all the Gods went back
3739,I. SENDING,"From around Balder, all the Heroes went;"
3740,I. SENDING,And left his body stretch'd upon the floor.
3741,I. SENDING,"And on their golden chairs they sate again,"
3742,I. SENDING,"Beside the tables, in the hall of Heaven;"
3743,I. SENDING,And before each the cooks who served them placed
3744,I. SENDING,"New messes of the boar Serimner's flesh,"
3745,I. SENDING,And the Valkyries crown'd their horns with mead.
3746,I. SENDING,"So they, with pent-up hearts and tearless eyes,"
3747,I. SENDING,"Wailing no more, in silence ate and drank,"
3748,I. SENDING,"While twilight fell, and sacred night came on."
3749,I. SENDING,But the blind Hoder left the feasting Gods
3750,I. SENDING,"In Odin's hall, and went through Asgard streets,"
3751,I. SENDING,And past the haven where the Gods have moor'd
3752,I. SENDING,"Their ships, and through the gate, beyond the wall;"
3753,I. SENDING,"Though sightless, yet his own mind led the God."
3754,I. SENDING,Down to the margin of the roaring sea
3755,I. SENDING,"He came, and sadly went along the sand,"
3756,I. SENDING,Between the waves and black o'erhanging cliffs
3757,I. SENDING,Where in and out the screaming seafowl fly;
3758,I. SENDING,Until he came to where a gully breaks
3759,I. SENDING,"Through the cliff-wall, and a fresh stream runs down"
3760,I. SENDING,"From the high moors behind, and meets the sea."
3761,I. SENDING,"There, in the glen, Fensaler stands, the house"
3762,I. SENDING,"Of Frea, honour'd mother of the Gods,"
3763,I. SENDING,And shows its lighted windows to the main.
3764,I. SENDING,"There he went up, and pass'd the open doors;"
3765,I. SENDING,"And in the hall he found those women old,"
3766,I. SENDING,"The prophetesses, who by rite eterne"
3767,I. SENDING,On Frea's hearth feed high the sacred fire
3768,I. SENDING,Both night and day; and by the inner wall
3769,I. SENDING,"Upon her golden chair the Mother sate,"
3770,I. SENDING,"With folded hands, revolving things to come."
3771,I. SENDING,"To her drew Hoder near, and spake, and said:--"
3772,I. SENDING,"""Mother, a child of bale thou bar'st in me!"
3773,I. SENDING,"For, first, thou barest me with blinded eyes,"
3774,I. SENDING,"Sightless and helpless, wandering weak in Heaven;"
3775,I. SENDING,"And, after that, of ignorant witless mind"
3776,I. SENDING,"Thou barest me, and unforeseeing soul;"
3777,I. SENDING,"That I alone must take the branch from Lok,"
3778,I. SENDING,"The foe, the accuser, whom, though Gods, we hate,"
3779,I. SENDING,And cast it at the dear-loved Balder's breast
3780,I. SENDING,At whom the Gods in sport their weapons threw--
3781,I. SENDING,'Gainst that alone had Balder's life no charm.
3782,I. SENDING,"Now therefore what to attempt, or whither fly,"
3783,I. SENDING,For who will bear my hateful sight in Heaven?
3784,I. SENDING,"Can I, O mother, bring them Balder back?"
3785,I. SENDING,"Or--for thou know'st the fates, and things allow'd--"
3786,I. SENDING,"Can I with Hela's power a compact strike,"
3787,I. SENDING,"And make exchange, and give my life for his?"""
3788,I. SENDING,He spoke: the mother of the Gods replied:--
3789,I. SENDING,"""Hoder, ill-fated, child of bale, my son,"
3790,I. SENDING,"Sightless in soul and eye, what words are these?"
3791,I. SENDING,"That one, long portion'd with his doom of death,"
3792,I. SENDING,"Should change his lot, and fill another's life,"
3793,I. SENDING,"And Hela yield to this, and let him go!"
3794,I. SENDING,"On Balder Death hath laid her hand, not thee;"
3795,I. SENDING,Nor doth she count this life a price for that.
3796,I. SENDING,"For many Gods in Heaven, not thou alone,"
3797,I. SENDING,"Would freely die to purchase Balder back,"
3798,I. SENDING,And wend themselves to Hela's gloomy realm.
3799,I. SENDING,For not so gladsome is that life in Heaven
3800,I. SENDING,"Which Gods and heroes lead, in feast and fray,"
3801,I. SENDING,"Waiting the darkness of the final times,"
3802,I. SENDING,"That one should grudge its loss for Balder's sake,"
3803,I. SENDING,"Balder their joy, so bright, so loved a God."
3804,I. SENDING,"But fate withstands, and laws forbid this way."
3805,I. SENDING,"Yet in my secret mind one way I know,"
3806,I. SENDING,Nor do I judge if it shall win or fail;
3807,I. SENDING,"But much must still be tried, which shall but fail."""
3808,I. SENDING,"And the blind Hoder answer'd her, and said:--"
3809,I. SENDING,"""What way is this, O mother, that thou show'st?"
3810,I. SENDING,"Is it a matter which a God might try?"""
3811,I. SENDING,And straight the mother of the Gods replied:--
3812,I. SENDING,"""There is a road which leads to Hela's realm,"
3813,I. SENDING,"Untrodden, lonely, far from light and Heaven."
3814,I. SENDING,Who goes that way must take no other horse
3815,I. SENDING,"To ride, but Sleipner, Odin's horse, alone."
3816,I. SENDING,Nor must he choose that common path of Gods
3817,I. SENDING,"Which every day they come and go in Heaven,"
3818,I. SENDING,"O'er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall's watch,"
3819,I. SENDING,"Past Midgard fortress, down to earth and men."
3820,I. SENDING,But he must tread a dark untravell'd road
3821,I. SENDING,"Which branches from the north of Heaven, and ride"
3822,I. SENDING,"Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,"
3823,I. SENDING,"Through valleys deep-engulph'd, with roaring streams."
3824,I. SENDING,And he will reach on the tenth morn a bridge
3825,I. SENDING,"Which spans with golden arches Giall's stream,"
3826,I. SENDING,"Not Bifrost, but that bridge a damsel keeps,"
3827,I. SENDING,Who tells the passing troops of dead their way
3828,I. SENDING,"To the low shore of ghosts, and Hela's realm."
3829,I. SENDING,And she will bid him northward steer his course.
3830,I. SENDING,"Then he will journey through no lighted land,"
3831,I. SENDING,"Nor see the sun arise, nor see it set;"
3832,I. SENDING,"But he must ever watch the northern Bear,"
3833,I. SENDING,Who from her frozen height with jealous eye
3834,I. SENDING,"Confronts the Dog and Hunter in the south,"
3835,I. SENDING,And is alone not dipt in Ocean's stream.
3836,I. SENDING,And straight he will come down to Ocean's strand--
3837,I. SENDING,"Ocean, whose watery ring enfolds the world,"
3838,I. SENDING,And on whose marge the ancient giants dwell.
3839,I. SENDING,"But he will reach its unknown northern shore,"
3840,I. SENDING,"Far, far beyond the outmost giant's home,"
3841,I. SENDING,"At the chink'd fields of ice, the waste of snow."
3842,I. SENDING,And he must fare across the dismal ice
3843,I. SENDING,"Northward, until he meets a stretching wall"
3844,I. SENDING,"Barring his way, and in the wall a grate."
3845,I. SENDING,"But then he must dismount, and on the ice"
3846,I. SENDING,"Tighten the girths of Sleipner, Odin's horse,"
3847,I. SENDING,"And make him leap the grate, and come within."
3848,I. SENDING,"And he will see stretch round him Hela's realm,"
3849,I. SENDING,"The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,"
3850,I. SENDING,And hear the roaring of the streams of Hell.
3851,I. SENDING,"And he will see the feeble, shadowy tribes,"
3852,I. SENDING,"And Balder sitting crown'd, and Hela's throne."
3853,I. SENDING,Then must he not regard the wailful ghosts
3854,I. SENDING,"Who all will flit, like eddying leaves, around;"
3855,I. SENDING,"But he must straight accost their solemn queen,"
3856,I. SENDING,"And pay her homage, and entreat with prayers,"
3857,I. SENDING,Telling her all that grief they have in Heaven
3858,I. SENDING,"For Balder, whom she holds by right below;"
3859,I. SENDING,"If haply he may melt her heart with words,"
3860,I. SENDING,"And make her yield, and give him Balder back."""
3861,I. SENDING,She spoke; but Hoder answer'd her and said:--
3862,I. SENDING,"""Mother, a dreadful way is this thou show'st;"
3863,I. SENDING,"No journey for a sightless God to go!"""
3864,I. SENDING,And straight the mother of the Gods replied:--
3865,I. SENDING,"""Therefore thyself thou shalt not go, my son."
3866,I. SENDING,But he whom first thou meetest when thou com'st
3867,I. SENDING,"To Asgard, and declar'st this hidden way,"
3868,I. SENDING,"Shall go; and I will be his guide unseen."""
3869,I. SENDING,"She spoke, and on her face let fall her veil,"
3870,I. SENDING,"And bow'd her head, and sate with folded hands,"
3871,I. SENDING,"But at the central hearth those women old,"
3872,I. SENDING,"Who while the Mother spake had ceased their toil,"
3873,I. SENDING,Began again to heap the sacred fire.
3874,I. SENDING,"And Hoder turn'd, and left his mother's house,"
3875,I. SENDING,"Fensaler, whose lit windows look to sea;"
3876,I. SENDING,"And came again down to the roaring waves,"
3877,I. SENDING,"And back along the beach to Asgard went,"
3878,I. SENDING,Pondering on that which Frea said should be.
3879,I. SENDING,"But night came down, and darken'd Asgard streets"
3880,I. SENDING,"Then from their loathéd feasts the Gods arose,"
3881,I. SENDING,"And lighted torches, and took up the corpse"
3882,I. SENDING,"Of Balder from the floor of Odin's hall,"
3883,I. SENDING,"And laid it on a bier, and bare him home"
3884,I. SENDING,"Through the fast-darkening streets to his own house,"
3885,I. SENDING,"Breidablik, on whose columns Balder graved"
3886,I. SENDING,The enchantments that recall the dead to life.
3887,I. SENDING,"For wise he was, and many curious arts,"
3888,I. SENDING,"Postures of runes, and healing herbs he knew;"
3889,I. SENDING,"Unhappy! but that art he did not know,"
3890,I. SENDING,"To keep his own life safe, and see the sun."
3891,I. SENDING,"There to his hall the Gods brought Balder home,"
3892,I. SENDING,And each bespake him as he laid him down:--
3893,I. SENDING,"""Would that ourselves, O Balder, we were borne"
3894,I. SENDING,"Home to our halls, with torchlight, by our kin,"
3895,I. SENDING,"So thou might'st live, and still delight the Gods!"""
3896,I. SENDING,They spake; and each went home to his own house.
3897,I. SENDING,"But there was one, the first of all the Gods"
3898,I. SENDING,"For speed, and Hermod was his name in Heaven;"
3899,I. SENDING,"Most fleet he was, but now he went the last,"
3900,I. SENDING,"Heavy in heart for Balder, to his house,"
3901,I. SENDING,"Which he in Asgard built him, there to dwell,"
3902,I. SENDING,"Against the harbour, by the city-wall."
3903,I. SENDING,"Him the blind Hoder met, as he came up"
3904,I. SENDING,"From the sea cityward, and knew his step;"
3905,I. SENDING,"Nor yet could Hermod see his brother's face,"
3906,I. SENDING,For it grew dark; but Hoder touch'd his arm.
3907,I. SENDING,And as a spray of honeysuckle flowers
3908,I. SENDING,Brushes across a tired traveller's face
3909,I. SENDING,"Who shuffles through the deep dew-moisten'd dust,"
3910,I. SENDING,"On a May evening, in the darken'd lanes,"
3911,I. SENDING,"And starts him, that he thinks a ghost went by--"
3912,I. SENDING,"So Hoder brush'd by Hermod's side, and said:--"
3913,I. SENDING,"""Take Sleipner, Hermod, and set forth with dawn"
3914,I. SENDING,"To Hela's kingdom, to ask Balder back;"
3915,I. SENDING,"And they shall be thy guides, who have the power."""
3916,I. SENDING,"He spake, and brush'd soft by, and disappear'd."
3917,I. SENDING,"And Hermod gazed into the night, and said:--"
3918,I. SENDING,"""Who is it utters through the dark his hest"
3919,I. SENDING,"So quickly, and will wait for no reply?"
3920,I. SENDING,The voice was like the unhappy Hoder's voice.
3921,I. SENDING,"Howbeit I will see, and do his hest;"
3922,I. SENDING,"For there rang note divine in that command."""
3923,I. SENDING,"So speaking, the fleet-footed Hermod came"
3924,I. SENDING,"Home, and lay down to sleep in his own house;"
3925,I. SENDING,And all the Gods lay down in their own homes.
3926,I. SENDING,"And Hoder too came home, distraught with grief,"
3927,I. SENDING,"Loathing to meet, at dawn, the other Gods;"
3928,I. SENDING,"And he went in, and shut the door, and fixt"
3929,I. SENDING,"His sword upright, and fell on it, and died."
3930,I. SENDING,"But from the hill of Lidskialf Odin rose,"
3931,I. SENDING,"The throne, from which his eye surveys the world;"
3932,I. SENDING,"And mounted Sleipner, and in darkness rode"
3933,I. SENDING,"To Asgard. And the stars came out in heaven,"
3934,I. SENDING,"High over Asgard, to light home the King."
3935,I. SENDING,"But fiercely Odin gallop'd, moved in heart;"
3936,I. SENDING,"And swift to Asgard, to the gate, he came."
3937,I. SENDING,And terribly the hoofs of Sleipner rang
3938,I. SENDING,"Along the flinty floor of Asgard streets,"
3939,I. SENDING,And the Gods trembled on their golden beds
3940,I. SENDING,Hearing the wrathful Father coming home--
3941,I. SENDING,"For dread, for like a whirlwind, Odin came."
3942,I. SENDING,"And to Valhalla's gate he rode, and left"
3943,I. SENDING,Sleipner; and Sleipner went to his own stall;
3944,I. SENDING,And in Valhalla Odin laid him down.
3945,I. SENDING,"But in Breidablik, Nanna, Balder's wife,"
3946,I. SENDING,"Came with the Goddesses who wrought her will,"
3947,I. SENDING,And stood by Balder lying on his bier.
3948,I. SENDING,And at his head and feet she station'd Scalds
3949,I. SENDING,Who in their lives were famous for their song;
3950,I. SENDING,"These o'er the corpse intoned a plaintive strain,"
3951,I. SENDING,A dirge--and Nanna and her train replied.
3952,I. SENDING,And far into the night they wail'd their dirge.
3953,I. SENDING,"But when their souls were satisfied with wail,"
3954,I. SENDING,"They went, and laid them down, and Nanna went"
3955,I. SENDING,"Into an upper chamber, and lay down;"
3956,I. SENDING,And Frea seal'd her tired lids with sleep.
3957,I. SENDING,"And 'twas when night is bordering hard on dawn,"
3958,I. SENDING,"When air is chilliest, and the stars sunk low;"
3959,I. SENDING,"Then Balder's spirit through the gloom drew near,"
3960,I. SENDING,"In garb, in form, in feature as he was,"
3961,I. SENDING,Alive; and still the rays were round his head
3962,I. SENDING,Which were his glorious mark in Heaven; he stood
3963,I. SENDING,"Over against the curtain of the bed,"
3964,I. SENDING,"And gazed on Nanna as she slept, and spake:--"
3965,I. SENDING,"""Poor lamb, thou sleepest, and forgett'st thy woe!"
3966,I. SENDING,"Tears stand upon the lashes of thine eyes,"
3967,I. SENDING,"Tears wet the pillow by thy cheek; but thou,"
3968,I. SENDING,"Like a young child, hast cried thyself to sleep."
3969,I. SENDING,"Sleep on; I watch thee, and am here to aid."
3970,I. SENDING,"Alive I kept not far from thee, dear soul!"
3971,I. SENDING,"Neither do I neglect thee now, though dead."
3972,I. SENDING,For with to-morrow's dawn the Gods prepare
3973,I. SENDING,"To gather wood, and build a funeral-pile"
3974,I. SENDING,"Upon my ship, and burn my corpse with fire,"
3975,I. SENDING,"That sad, sole honour of the dead; and thee"
3976,I. SENDING,"They think to burn, and all my choicest wealth,"
3977,I. SENDING,"With me, for thus ordains the common rite."
3978,I. SENDING,"But it shall not be so; but mild, but swift,"
3979,I. SENDING,"But painless shall a stroke from Frea come,"
3980,I. SENDING,"To cut thy thread of life, and free thy soul,"
3981,I. SENDING,"And they shall burn thy corpse with mine, not thee."
3982,I. SENDING,"And well I know that by no stroke of death,"
3983,I. SENDING,"Tardy or swift, would'st thou be loath to die,"
3984,I. SENDING,"So it restored thee, Nanna, to my side,"
3985,I. SENDING,Whom thou so well hast loved; but I can smooth
3986,I. SENDING,"Thy way, and this, at least, my prayers avail."
3987,I. SENDING,"Yes, and I fain would altogether ward"
3988,I. SENDING,"Death from thy head, and with the Gods in Heaven"
3989,I. SENDING,"Prolong thy life, though not by thee desired--"
3990,I. SENDING,"But right bars this, not only thy desire."
3991,I. SENDING,"Yet dreary, Nanna, is the life they lead"
3992,I. SENDING,"In that dim world, in Hela's mouldering realm;"
3993,I. SENDING,"And doleful are the ghosts, the troops of dead,"
3994,I. SENDING,Whom Hela with austere control presides.
3995,I. SENDING,"For of the race of Gods is no one there,"
3996,I. SENDING,"Save me alone, and Hela, solemn queen;"
3997,I. SENDING,And all the nobler souls of mortal men
3998,I. SENDING,"On battle-field have met their death, and now"
3999,I. SENDING,"Feast in Valhalla, in my father's hall;"
4000,I. SENDING,"Only the inglorious sort are there below,"
4001,I. SENDING,"The old, the cowards, and the weak are there--"
4002,I. SENDING,"Men spent by sickness, or obscure decay."
4003,I. SENDING,"But even there, O Nanna, we might find"
4004,I. SENDING,"Some solace in each other's look and speech,"
4005,I. SENDING,"Wandering together through that gloomy world,"
4006,I. SENDING,"And talking of the life we led in Heaven,"
4007,I. SENDING,"While we yet lived, among the other Gods."""
4008,I. SENDING,"He spake, and straight his lineaments began"
4009,I. SENDING,To fade; and Nanna in her sleep stretch'd out
4010,I. SENDING,Her arms towards him with a cry--but he
4011,I. SENDING,"Mournfully shook his head, and disappear'd."
4012,I. SENDING,And as the woodman sees a little smoke
4013,I. SENDING,"Hang in the air, afield, and disappear,"
4014,I. SENDING,So Balder faded in the night away.
4015,I. SENDING,And Nanna on her bed sank back; but then
4016,I. SENDING,"Frea, the mother of the Gods, with stroke"
4017,I. SENDING,"Painless and swift, set free her airy soul,"
4018,I. SENDING,"Which took, on Balder's track, the way below;"
4019,I. SENDING,And instantly the sacred morn appear'd.
4020,I. SENDING,
4021,I. SENDING,
4022,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD
4023,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,
4024,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Forth from the east, up the ascent of Heaven,"
4025,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Day drove his courser with the shining mane;
4026,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And in Valhalla, from his gable-perch,"
4027,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,The golden-crested cock began to crow.
4028,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Hereafter, in the blackest dead of night,"
4029,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"With shrill and dismal cries that bird shall crow,"
4030,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Warning the Gods that foes draw nigh to Heaven;
4031,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But now he crew at dawn, a cheerful note,"
4032,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,To wake the Gods and Heroes to their tasks.
4033,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And all the Gods, and all the Heroes, woke."
4034,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And from their beds the Heroes rose, and donn'd"
4035,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Their arms, and led their horses from the stall,"
4036,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And mounted them, and in Valhalla's court"
4037,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Were ranged; and then the daily fray began.
4038,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And all day long they there are hack'd and hewn,"
4039,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"'Mid dust, and groans, and limbs lopp'd off, and blood;"
4040,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But all at night return to Odin's hall,"
4041,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Woundless and fresh; such lot is theirs in Heaven.
4042,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And the Valkyries on their steeds went forth
4043,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Tow'rd earth and fights of men; and at their side
4044,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Skulda, the youngest of the Nornies, rode;"
4045,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And over Bifrost, where is Heimdall's watch,"
4046,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Past Midgard fortress, down to earth they came;"
4047,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"There through some battle-field, where men fall fast,"
4048,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Their horses fetlock-deep in blood, they ride,"
4049,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And pick the bravest warriors out for death,"
4050,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Whom they bring back with them at night to Heaven
4051,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To glad the Gods, and feast in Odin's hall."
4052,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But the Gods went not now, as otherwhile,"
4053,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Into the tilt-yard, where the Heroes fought,"
4054,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,To feast their eyes with looking on the fray;
4055,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Nor did they to their judgment-place repair
4056,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"By the ash Igdrasil, in Ida's plain,"
4057,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Where they hold council, and give laws for men."
4058,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But they went, Odin first, the rest behind,"
4059,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To the hall Gladheim, which is built of gold;"
4060,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Where are in circle ranged twelve golden chairs,"
4061,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And in the midst one higher, Odin's throne."
4062,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,There all the Gods in silence sate them down;
4063,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And thus the Father of the ages spake:--
4064,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""Go quickly, Gods, bring wood to the seashore,"
4065,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"With all, which it beseems the dead to have,"
4066,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And make a funeral-pile on Balder's ship;
4067,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,On the twelfth day the Gods shall burn his corpse.
4068,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But Hermod, thou, take Sleipner, and ride down"
4069,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To Hela's kingdom, to ask Balder back."""
4070,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"So said he; and the Gods arose, and took"
4071,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Axes and ropes, and at their head came Thor,"
4072,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Shouldering his hammer, which the giants know."
4073,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Forth wended they, and drave their steeds before."
4074,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And up the dewy mountain-tracks they fared
4075,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To the dark forests, in the early dawn;"
4076,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And up and down, and side and slant they roam'd."
4077,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And from the glens all day an echo came
4078,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Of crashing falls; for with his hammer Thor
4079,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Smote 'mid the rocks the lichen-bearded pines,"
4080,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And burst their roots, while to their tops the Gods"
4081,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Made fast the woven ropes, and haled them down,"
4082,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And lopp'd their boughs, and clove them on the sward,"
4083,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And bound the logs behind their steeds to draw,"
4084,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And drave them homeward; and the snorting steeds
4085,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Went straining through the crackling brushwood down,"
4086,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And by the darkling forest-paths the Gods
4087,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Follow'd, and on their shoulders carried boughs."
4088,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And they came out upon the plain, and pass'd"
4089,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Asgard, and led their horses to the beach,"
4090,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And loosed them of their loads on the seashore,"
4091,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And ranged the wood in stacks by Balder's ship;
4092,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And every God went home to his own house.
4093,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But when the Gods were to the forest gone,"
4094,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Hermod led Sleipner from Valhalla forth
4095,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And saddled him; before that, Sleipner brook'd"
4096,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"No meaner hand than Odin's on his mane,"
4097,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,On his broad back no lesser rider bore;
4098,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Yet docile now he stood at Hermod's side,"
4099,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Arching his neck, and glad to be bestrode,"
4100,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Knowing the God they went to seek, how dear."
4101,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But Hermod mounted him, and sadly fared"
4102,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,In silence up the dark untravell'd road
4103,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Which branches from the north of Heaven, and went"
4104,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"All day; and daylight waned, and night came on."
4105,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And all that night he rode, and journey'd so,"
4106,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Nine days, nine nights, toward the northern ice,"
4107,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Through valleys deep-engulph'd, by roaring streams."
4108,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And on the tenth morn he beheld the bridge
4109,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Which spans with golden arches Giall's stream,"
4110,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And on the bridge a damsel watching arm'd,"
4111,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"In the strait passage, at the farther end,"
4112,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Where the road issues between walling rocks.
4113,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Scant space that warder left for passers by;--
4114,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,But as when cowherds in October drive
4115,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Their kine across a snowy mountain-pass
4116,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To winter-pasture on the southern side,"
4117,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And on the ridge a waggon chokes the way,"
4118,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Wedged in the snow; then painfully the hinds
4119,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"With goad and shouting urge their cattle past,"
4120,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Plunging through deep untrodden banks of snow
4121,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To right and left, and warm steam fills the air--"
4122,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"So on the bridge that damsel block'd the way,"
4123,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And question'd Hermod as he came, and said:--"
4124,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""Who art thou on thy black and fiery horse"
4125,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Under whose hoofs the bridge o'er Giall's stream
4126,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Rumbles and shakes? Tell me thy race and home.
4127,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But yestermorn, five troops of dead pass'd by,"
4128,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Bound on their way below to Hela's realm,"
4129,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Nor shook the bridge so much as thou alone.
4130,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And thou hast flesh and colour on thy cheeks,"
4131,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Like men who live, and draw the vital air;"
4132,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Nor look'st thou pale and wan, like men deceased,"
4133,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Souls bound below, my daily passers here."""
4134,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And the fleet-footed Hermod answer'd her:--
4135,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""O damsel, Hermod am I call'd, the son"
4136,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Of Odin; and my high-roof'd house is built
4137,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Far hence, in Asgard, in the city of Gods;"
4138,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And Sleipner, Odin's horse, is this I ride."
4139,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And I come, sent this road on Balder's track;"
4140,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Say then, if he hath cross'd thy bridge or no?"""
4141,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,He spake; the warder of the bridge replied:--
4142,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""O Hermod, rarely do the feet of Gods"
4143,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Or of the horses of the Gods resound
4144,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Upon my bridge; and, when they cross, I know."
4145,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Balder hath gone this way, and ta'en the road"
4146,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Below there, to the north, tow'rd Hela's realm."
4147,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"From here the cold white mist can be discern'd,"
4148,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Nor lit with sun, but through the darksome air"
4149,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"By the dim vapour-blotted light of stars,"
4150,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Which hangs over the ice where lies the road.
4151,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"For in that ice are lost those northern streams,"
4152,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Freezing and ridging in their onward flow,"
4153,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Which from the fountain of Vergelmer run,"
4154,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,The spring that bubbles up by Hela's throne.
4155,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"There are the joyless seats, the haunt of ghosts,"
4156,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Hela's pale swarms; and there was Balder bound.
4157,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Ride on! pass free! but he by this is there."""
4158,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"She spake, and stepp'd aside, and left him room."
4159,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And Hermod greeted her, and gallop'd by"
4160,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Across the bridge; then she took post again.
4161,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But northward Hermod rode, the way below;"
4162,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And o'er a darksome tract, which knows no sun,"
4163,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But by the blotted light of stars, he fared."
4164,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And he came down to Ocean's northern strand,"
4165,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"At the drear ice, beyond the giants' home."
4166,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Thence on he journey'd o'er the fields of ice
4167,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Still north, until he met a stretching wall"
4168,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Barring his way, and in the wall a grate."
4169,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Then he dismounted, and drew tight the girths,"
4170,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"On the smooth ice, of Sleipner, Odin's horse,"
4171,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And made him leap the grate, and came within."
4172,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And he beheld spread round him Hela's realm,"
4173,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"The plains of Niflheim, where dwell the dead,"
4174,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And heard the thunder of the streams of Hell.
4175,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"For near the wall the river of Roaring flows,"
4176,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Outmost; the others near the centre run--
4177,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"The Storm, the Abyss, the Howling, and the Pain;"
4178,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"These flow by Hela's throne, and near their spring."
4179,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And from the dark flock'd up the shadowy tribes;--
4180,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And as the swallows crowd the bulrush-beds
4181,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Of some clear river, issuing from a lake,"
4182,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"On autumn-days, before they cross the sea;"
4183,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And to each bulrush-crest a swallow hangs
4184,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Quivering, and others skim the river-streams,"
4185,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And their quick twittering fills the banks and shores--
4186,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,So around Hermod swarm'd the twittering ghosts.
4187,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Women, and infants, and young men who died"
4188,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Too soon for fame, with white ungraven shields;"
4189,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And old men, known to glory, but their star"
4190,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Betray'd them, and of wasting age they died,"
4191,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Not wounds; yet, dying, they their armour wore,"
4192,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And now have chief regard in Hela's realm.
4193,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Behind flock'd wrangling up a piteous crew,"
4194,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Greeted of none, disfeatured and forlorn--"
4195,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Cowards, who were in sloughs interr'd alive;"
4196,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And round them still the wattled hurdles hung,"
4197,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Wherewith they stamp'd them down, and trod them deep,"
4198,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,To hide their shameful memory from men.
4199,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But all he pass'd unhail'd, and reach'd the throne"
4200,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Of Hela, and saw, near it, Balder crown'd,"
4201,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And Hela set thereon, with countenance stern;"
4202,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And thus bespake him first the solemn queen:--
4203,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""Unhappy, how hast thou endured to leave"
4204,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"The light, and journey to the cheerless land"
4205,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Where idly flit about the feeble shades?
4206,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"How didst thou cross the bridge o'er Giall's stream,"
4207,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Being alive, and come to Ocean's shore?"
4208,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Or how o'erleap the grate that bars the wall?"""
4209,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"She spake: but down off Sleipner Hermod sprang,"
4210,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And fell before her feet, and clasp'd her knees;"
4211,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And spake, and mild entreated her, and said:--"
4212,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""O Hela, wherefore should the Gods declare"
4213,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Their errands to each other, or the ways"
4214,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,They go? the errand and the way is known.
4215,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Thou know'st, thou know'st, what grief we have in Heaven"
4216,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"For Balder, whom thou hold'st by right below."
4217,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Restore him! for what part fulfils he here?
4218,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Shall he shed cheer over the cheerless seats,"
4219,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And touch the apathetic ghosts with joy?
4220,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Not for such end, O queen, thou hold'st thy realm."
4221,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"For Heaven was Balder born, the city of Gods"
4222,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And Heroes, where they live in light and joy."
4223,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Thither restore him, for his place is there!"""
4224,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,He spoke; and grave replied the solemn queen:--
4225,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""Hermod, for he thou art, thou son of Heaven!"
4226,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"A strange unlikely errand, sure, is thine."
4227,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Do the Gods send to me to make them blest?
4228,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Small bliss my race hath of the Gods obtained.
4229,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Three mighty children to my father Lok
4230,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Did Angerbode, the giantess, bring forth--"
4231,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Fenris the wolf, the Serpent huge, and me."
4232,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Of these the Serpent in the sea ye cast,"
4233,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Who since in your despite hath wax'd amain,"
4234,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And now with gleaming ring enfolds the world;
4235,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Me on this cheerless nether world ye threw,"
4236,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And gave me nine unlighted realms to rule;
4237,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"While on his island in the lake afar,"
4238,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Made fast to the bored crag, by wile not strength"
4239,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Subdued, with limber chains lives Fenris bound."
4240,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Lok still subsists in Heaven, our father wise,"
4241,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Your mate, though loathed, and feasts in Odin's hall;"
4242,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But him too foes await, and netted snares,"
4243,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And in a cave a bed of needle-rocks,"
4244,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And o'er his visage serpents dropping gall.
4245,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Yet he shall one day rise, and burst his bonds,"
4246,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And with himself set us his offspring free,"
4247,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,When he guides Muspel's children to their bourne.
4248,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Till then in peril or in pain we live,"
4249,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Wrought by the Gods--and ask the Gods our aid?
4250,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Howbeit, we abide our day; till then,"
4251,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,We do not as some feebler haters do--
4252,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Seek to afflict our foes with petty pangs,"
4253,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Helpless to better us, or ruin them."
4254,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Come then! if Balder was so dear beloved,"
4255,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And this is true, and such a loss is Heaven's--"
4256,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Hear, how to Heaven may Balder be restored."
4257,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Show me through all the world the signs of grief!
4258,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Fails but one thing to grieve, here Balder stops!"
4259,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Let all that lives and moves upon the earth
4260,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Weep him, and all that is without life weep;"
4261,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Let Gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones!"
4262,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"So shall I know the lost was dear indeed,"
4263,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And bend my heart, and give him back to Heaven."""
4264,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"She spake; and Hermod answer'd her, and said:--"
4265,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""Hela, such as thou say'st, the terms shall be."
4266,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But come, declare me this, and truly tell:"
4267,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"May I, ere I depart, bid Balder hail,"
4268,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Or is it here withheld to greet the dead?"""
4269,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"He spake, and straightway Hela answered him:--"
4270,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""Hermod, greet Balder if thou wilt, and hold"
4271,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Converse; his speech remains, though he be dead."""
4272,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And straight to Balder Hermod turn'd, and spake:--"
4273,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""Even in the abode of death, O Balder, hail!"
4274,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Thou hear'st, if hearing, like as speech, is thine,"
4275,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,The terms of thy releasement hence to Heaven;
4276,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Fear nothing but that all shall be fulfill'd.
4277,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"For not unmindful of thee are the Gods,"
4278,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Who see the light, and blest in Asgard dwell;"
4279,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Even here they seek thee out, in Hela's realm."
4280,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And sure of all the happiest far art thou
4281,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Who ever have been known in earth or Heaven;
4282,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Alive, thou wast of Gods the most beloved,"
4283,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And now thou sittest crown'd by Hela's side,"
4284,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Here, and hast honour among all the dead."""
4285,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"He spake; and Balder utter'd him reply,"
4286,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But feebly, as a voice far off; he said:--"
4287,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"""Hermod the nimble, gild me not my death!"
4288,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Better to live a serf, a captured man,"
4289,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Who scatters rushes in a master's hall,"
4290,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Than be a crown'd king here, and rule the dead."
4291,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And now I count not of these terms as safe
4292,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To be fulfill'd, nor my return as sure,"
4293,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Though I be loved, and many mourn my death;"
4294,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,For double-minded ever was the seed
4295,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Of Lok, and double are the gifts they give."
4296,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Howbeit, report thy message; and therewith,"
4297,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To Odin, to my father, take this ring,"
4298,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Memorial of me, whether saved or no;"
4299,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And tell the Heaven-born Gods how thou hast seen
4300,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Me sitting here below by Hela's side,"
4301,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Crown'd, having honour among all the dead."""
4302,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"He spake, and raised his hand, and gave the ring."
4303,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And with inscrutable regard the queen
4304,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Of Hell beheld them, and the ghosts stood dumb."
4305,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But Hermod took the ring, and yet once more"
4306,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Kneel'd and did homage to the solemn queen;
4307,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Then mounted Sleipner, and set forth to ride"
4308,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Back, through the astonish'd tribes of dead, to Heaven."
4309,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And to the wall he came, and found the grate"
4310,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Lifted, and issued on the fields of ice."
4311,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And o'er the ice he fared to Ocean's strand,"
4312,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And up from thence, a wet and misty road,"
4313,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To the arm'd damsel's bridge, and Giall's stream."
4314,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Worse was that way to go than to return,"
4315,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,For him;--for others all return is barr'd.
4316,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Nine days he took to go, two to return,"
4317,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And on the twelfth morn saw the light of Heaven.
4318,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And as a traveller in the early dawn
4319,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"To the steep edge of some great valley comes,"
4320,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Through which a river flows, and sees, beneath,"
4321,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Clouds of white rolling vapours fill the vale,"
4322,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"But o'er them, on the farther slope, descries"
4323,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Vineyards, and crofts, and pastures, bright with sun--"
4324,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"So Hermod, o'er the fog between, saw Heaven."
4325,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And Sleipner snorted, for he smelt the air"
4326,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Of Heaven; and mightily, as wing'd, he flew."
4327,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,And Hermod saw the towers of Asgard rise;
4328,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And he drew near, and heard no living voice"
4329,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,In Asgard; and the golden halls were dumb.
4330,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,Then Hermod knew what labour held the Gods;
4331,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"And through the empty streets he rode, and pass'd"
4332,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,"Under the gate-house to the sands, and found"
4333,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,The Gods on the sea-shore by Balder's ship.
4334,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,
4335,2. JOURNEY TO THE DEAD,
4336,3. FUNERAL,3. FUNERAL
4337,3. FUNERAL,
4338,3. FUNERAL,"The Gods held talk together, group'd in knots,"
4339,3. FUNERAL,"Round Balder's corpse, which they had thither borne;"
4340,3. FUNERAL,And Hermod came down tow'rds them from the gate.
4341,3. FUNERAL,"And Lok, the father of the serpent, first"
4342,3. FUNERAL,"Beheld him come, and to his neighbour spake:--"
4343,3. FUNERAL,"""See, here is Hermod, who comes single back"
4344,3. FUNERAL,From Hell; and shall I tell thee how he seems?
4345,3. FUNERAL,"Like as a farmer, who hath lost his dog,"
4346,3. FUNERAL,"Some morn, at market, in a crowded town--"
4347,3. FUNERAL,"Through many streets the poor beast runs in vain,"
4348,3. FUNERAL,"And follows this man after that, for hours;"
4349,3. FUNERAL,"And, late at evening, spent and panting, falls"
4350,3. FUNERAL,"Before a stranger's threshold, not his home,"
4351,3. FUNERAL,"With flanks a-tremble, and his slender tongue"
4352,3. FUNERAL,"Hangs quivering out between his dust-smear'd jaws,"
4353,3. FUNERAL,And piteously he eyes the passers by;
4354,3. FUNERAL,"But home his master comes to his own farm,"
4355,3. FUNERAL,"Far in the country, wondering where he is--"
4356,3. FUNERAL,"So Hermod comes to-day unfollow'd home."""
4357,3. FUNERAL,"And straight his neighbour, moved with wrath, replied:--"
4358,3. FUNERAL,"""Deceiver! fair in form, but false in heart!"
4359,3. FUNERAL,"Enemy, mocker, whom, though Gods, we hate--"
4360,3. FUNERAL,"Peace, lest our father Odin hear thee gibe!"
4361,3. FUNERAL,"Would I might see him snatch thee in his hand,"
4362,3. FUNERAL,"And bind thy carcase, like a bale, with cords,"
4363,3. FUNERAL,"And hurl thee in a lake, to sink or swim!"
4364,3. FUNERAL,"If clear from plotting Balder's death, to swim;"
4365,3. FUNERAL,"But deep, if thou devisedst it, to drown,"
4366,3. FUNERAL,"And perish, against fate, before thy day."""
4367,3. FUNERAL,So they two soft to one another spake.
4368,3. FUNERAL,"But Odin look'd toward the land, and saw"
4369,3. FUNERAL,"His messenger; and he stood forth, and cried."
4370,3. FUNERAL,"And Hermod came, and leapt from Sleipner down,"
4371,3. FUNERAL,"And in his father's hand put Sleipner's rein,"
4372,3. FUNERAL,"And greeted Odin and the Gods, and said:--"
4373,3. FUNERAL,"""Odin, my father, and ye, Gods of Heaven!"
4374,3. FUNERAL,"Lo, home, having perform'd your will, I come."
4375,3. FUNERAL,"Into the joyless kingdom have I been,"
4376,3. FUNERAL,"Below, and look'd upon the shadowy tribes"
4377,3. FUNERAL,"Of ghosts, and communed with their solemn queen;"
4378,3. FUNERAL,And to your prayer she sends you this reply:
4379,3. FUNERAL,_Show her through all the world the signs of grief!_
4380,3. FUNERAL,"_Fails but one thing to grieve, there Balder stops!_"
4381,3. FUNERAL,"_Let Gods, men, brutes, beweep him; plants and stones:_"
4382,3. FUNERAL,"_So shall she know your loss was dear indeed,_"
4383,3. FUNERAL,"_And bend her heart, and give you Balder back._"""
4384,3. FUNERAL,He spoke; and all the Gods to Odin look'd;
4385,3. FUNERAL,And straight the Father of the ages said:--
4386,3. FUNERAL,"""Ye Gods, these terms may keep another day."
4387,3. FUNERAL,"But now, put on your arms, and mount your steeds,"
4388,3. FUNERAL,"And in procession all come near, and weep"
4389,3. FUNERAL,Balder; for that is what the dead desire.
4390,3. FUNERAL,"When ye enough have wept, then build a pile"
4391,3. FUNERAL,"Of the heap'd wood, and burn his corpse with fire"
4392,3. FUNERAL,"Out of our sight; that we may turn from grief,"
4393,3. FUNERAL,"And lead, as erst, our daily life in Heaven."""
4394,3. FUNERAL,"He spoke, and the Gods arm'd; and Odin donn'd"
4395,3. FUNERAL,"His dazzling corslet and his helm of gold,"
4396,3. FUNERAL,And led the way on Sleipner; and the rest
4397,3. FUNERAL,"Follow'd, in tears, their father and their king."
4398,3. FUNERAL,"And thrice in arms around the dead they rode,"
4399,3. FUNERAL,"Weeping; the sands were wetted, and their arms,"
4400,3. FUNERAL,With their thick-falling tears--so good a friend
4401,3. FUNERAL,"They mourn'd that day, so bright, so loved a God."
4402,3. FUNERAL,"And Odin came, and laid his kingly hands"
4403,3. FUNERAL,"On Balder's breast, and thus began the wail:--"
4404,3. FUNERAL,"""Farewell, O Balder, bright and loved, my son!"
4405,3. FUNERAL,"In that great day, the twilight of the Gods,"
4406,3. FUNERAL,"When Muspel's children shall beleaguer Heaven,"
4407,3. FUNERAL,"Then we shall miss thy counsel and thy arm."""
4408,3. FUNERAL,"Thou camest near the next, O warrior Thor!"
4409,3. FUNERAL,"Shouldering thy hammer, in thy chariot drawn,"
4410,3. FUNERAL,Swaying the long-hair'd goats with silver'd rein;
4411,3. FUNERAL,And over Balder's corpse these words didst say:--
4412,3. FUNERAL,"""Brother, thou dwellest in the darksome land,"
4413,3. FUNERAL,"And talkest with the feeble tribes of ghosts,"
4414,3. FUNERAL,"Now, and I know not how they prize thee there--"
4415,3. FUNERAL,"But here, I know, thou wilt be miss'd and mourn'd."
4416,3. FUNERAL,For haughty spirits and high wraths are rife
4417,3. FUNERAL,"Among the Gods and Heroes here in Heaven,"
4418,3. FUNERAL,As among those whose joy and work is war;
4419,3. FUNERAL,"And daily strifes arise, and angry words."
4420,3. FUNERAL,"But from thy lips, O Balder, night or day,"
4421,3. FUNERAL,Heard no one ever an injurious word
4422,3. FUNERAL,"To God or Hero, but thou keptest back"
4423,3. FUNERAL,"The others, labouring to compose their brawls."
4424,3. FUNERAL,"Be ye then kind, as Balder too was kind!"
4425,3. FUNERAL,"For we lose him, who smoothed all strife in Heaven."""
4426,3. FUNERAL,"He spake, and all the Gods assenting wail'd."
4427,3. FUNERAL,"And Freya next came nigh, with golden tears;"
4428,3. FUNERAL,"The loveliest Goddess she in Heaven, by all"
4429,3. FUNERAL,"Most honour'd after Frea, Odin's wife."
4430,3. FUNERAL,Her long ago the wandering Oder took
4431,3. FUNERAL,"To mate, but left her to roam distant lands;"
4432,3. FUNERAL,"Since then she seeks him, and weeps tears of gold."
4433,3. FUNERAL,Names hath she many; Vanadis on earth
4434,3. FUNERAL,"They call her, Freya is her name in Heaven;"
4435,3. FUNERAL,"She in her hands took Balder's head, and spake:--"
4436,3. FUNERAL,"""Balder, my brother, thou art gone a road"
4437,3. FUNERAL,"Unknown and long, and haply on that way"
4438,3. FUNERAL,"My long-lost wandering Oder thou hast met,"
4439,3. FUNERAL,For in the paths of Heaven he is not found.
4440,3. FUNERAL,"Oh, if it be so, tell him what thou wast"
4441,3. FUNERAL,"To his neglected wife, and what he is,"
4442,3. FUNERAL,"And wring his heart with shame, to hear thy word!"
4443,3. FUNERAL,"For he, my husband, left me here to pine,"
4444,3. FUNERAL,"Not long a wife, when his unquiet heart"
4445,3. FUNERAL,First drove him from me into distant lands;
4446,3. FUNERAL,"Since then I vainly seek him through the world,"
4447,3. FUNERAL,"And weep from shore to shore my golden tears,"
4448,3. FUNERAL,But neither god nor mortal heeds my pain.
4449,3. FUNERAL,"Thou only, Balder, wast for ever kind,"
4450,3. FUNERAL,"To take my hand, and wipe my tears, and say:"
4451,3. FUNERAL,"_Weep not, O Freya, weep no golden tears!_"
4452,3. FUNERAL,"_One day the wandering Oder will return,_"
4453,3. FUNERAL,_Or thou wilt find him in thy faithful search_
4454,3. FUNERAL,"_On some great road, or resting in an inn,_"
4455,3. FUNERAL,"_Or at a ford, or sleeping by a tree._"
4456,3. FUNERAL,"So Balder said;--but Oder, well I know,"
4457,3. FUNERAL,My truant Oder I shall see no more
4458,3. FUNERAL,"To the world's end; and Balder now is gone,"
4459,3. FUNERAL,"And I am left uncomforted in Heaven."""
4460,3. FUNERAL,She spake; and all the Goddesses bewail'd.
4461,3. FUNERAL,"Last from among the Heroes one came near,"
4462,3. FUNERAL,"No God, but of the hero-troop the chief--"
4463,3. FUNERAL,"Regner, who swept the northern sea with fleets,"
4464,3. FUNERAL,"And ruled o'er Denmark and the heathy isles,"
4465,3. FUNERAL,Living; but Ella captured him and slew;--
4466,3. FUNERAL,"A king whose fame then fill'd the vast of Heaven,"
4467,3. FUNERAL,"Now time obscures it, and men's later deeds."
4468,3. FUNERAL,"He last approach'd the corpse, and spake, and said:--"
4469,3. FUNERAL,"""Balder, there yet are many Scalds in Heaven"
4470,3. FUNERAL,"Still left, and that chief Scald, thy brother Brage,"
4471,3. FUNERAL,"Whom we may bid to sing, though thou art gone."
4472,3. FUNERAL,"And all these gladly, while we drink, we hear,"
4473,3. FUNERAL,"After the feast is done, in Odin's hall;"
4474,3. FUNERAL,"But they harp ever on one string, and wake"
4475,3. FUNERAL,"Remembrance in our soul of wars alone,"
4476,3. FUNERAL,"Such as on earth we valiantly have waged,"
4477,3. FUNERAL,"And blood, and ringing blows, and violent death."
4478,3. FUNERAL,"But when thou sangest, Balder, thou didst strike"
4479,3. FUNERAL,"Another note, and, like a bird in spring,"
4480,3. FUNERAL,"Thy voice of joyance minded us, and youth,"
4481,3. FUNERAL,"And wife, and children, and our ancient home."
4482,3. FUNERAL,"Yes, and I, too, remember'd then no more"
4483,3. FUNERAL,"My dungeon, where the serpents stung me dead,"
4484,3. FUNERAL,Nor Ella's victory on the English coast--
4485,3. FUNERAL,"But I heard Thora laugh in Gothland Isle,"
4486,3. FUNERAL,"And saw my shepherdess, Aslauga, tend"
4487,3. FUNERAL,Her flock along the white Norwegian beach.
4488,3. FUNERAL,Tears started to mine eyes with yearning joy.
4489,3. FUNERAL,"Therefore with grateful heart I mourn thee dead."""
4490,3. FUNERAL,"So Regner spake, and all the Heroes groan'd."
4491,3. FUNERAL,"But now the sun had pass'd the height of Heaven,"
4492,3. FUNERAL,And soon had all that day been spent in wail;
4493,3. FUNERAL,But then the Father of the ages said:--
4494,3. FUNERAL,"""Ye Gods, there well may be too much of wail!"
4495,3. FUNERAL,Bring now the gather'd wood to Balder's ship;
4496,3. FUNERAL,"Heap on the deck the logs, and build the pyre."""
4497,3. FUNERAL,"But when the Gods and Heroes heard, they brought"
4498,3. FUNERAL,"The wood to Balder's ship, and built a pile,"
4499,3. FUNERAL,"Full the deck's breadth, and lofty; then the corpse"
4500,3. FUNERAL,"Of Balder on the highest top they laid,"
4501,3. FUNERAL,"With Nanna on his right, and on his left"
4502,3. FUNERAL,"Hoder, his brother, whom his own hand slew."
4503,3. FUNERAL,And they set jars of wine and oil to lean
4504,3. FUNERAL,"Against the bodies, and stuck torches near,"
4505,3. FUNERAL,"Splinters of pine-wood, soak'd with turpentine;"
4506,3. FUNERAL,"And brought his arms and gold, and all his stuff,"
4507,3. FUNERAL,"And slew the dogs who at his table fed,"
4508,3. FUNERAL,"And his horse, Balder's horse, whom most he loved,"
4509,3. FUNERAL,"And placed them on the pyre, and Odin threw"
4510,3. FUNERAL,"A last choice gift thereon, his golden ring."
4511,3. FUNERAL,"The mast they fixt, and hoisted up the sails,"
4512,3. FUNERAL,Then they put fire to the wood; and Thor
4513,3. FUNERAL,Set his stout shoulder hard against the stern
4514,3. FUNERAL,To push the ship through the thick sand;--sparks flew
4515,3. FUNERAL,"From the deep trench she plough'd, so strong a God"
4516,3. FUNERAL,Furrow'd it; and the water gurgled in.
4517,3. FUNERAL,"And the ship floated on the waves, and rock'd."
4518,3. FUNERAL,"But in the hills a strong east-wind arose,"
4519,3. FUNERAL,And came down moaning to the sea; first squalls
4520,3. FUNERAL,"Ran black o'er the sea's face, then steady rush'd"
4521,3. FUNERAL,"The breeze, and fill'd the sails, and blew the fire."
4522,3. FUNERAL,And wreathed in smoke the ship stood out to sea.
4523,3. FUNERAL,"Soon with a roaring rose the mighty fire,"
4524,3. FUNERAL,And the pile crackled; and between the logs
4525,3. FUNERAL,"Sharp quivering tongues of flame shot out, and leapt,"
4526,3. FUNERAL,"Curling and darting, higher, until they lick'd"
4527,3. FUNERAL,"The summit of the pile, the dead, the mast,"
4528,3. FUNERAL,And ate the shrivelling sails; but still the ship
4529,3. FUNERAL,"Drove on, ablaze above her hull with fire."
4530,3. FUNERAL,"And the Gods stood upon the beach, and gazed."
4531,3. FUNERAL,"And while they gazed, the sun went lurid down"
4532,3. FUNERAL,"Into the smoke-wrapt sea, and night came on."
4533,3. FUNERAL,"Then the wind fell, with night, and there was calm;"
4534,3. FUNERAL,But through the dark they watch'd the burning ship
4535,3. FUNERAL,"Still carried o'er the distant waters on,"
4536,3. FUNERAL,"Farther and farther, like an eye of fire."
4537,3. FUNERAL,"And long, in the far dark, blazed Balder's pile;"
4538,3. FUNERAL,"But fainter, as the stars rose high, it flared,"
4539,3. FUNERAL,"The bodies were consumed, ash choked the pile."
4540,3. FUNERAL,"And as, in a decaying winter-fire,"
4541,3. FUNERAL,"A charr'd log, falling, makes a shower of sparks--"
4542,3. FUNERAL,"So with a shower of sparks the pile fell in,"
4543,3. FUNERAL,Reddening the sea around; and all was dark.
4544,3. FUNERAL,But the Gods went by starlight up the shore
4545,3. FUNERAL,"To Asgard, and sate down in Odin's hall"
4546,3. FUNERAL,"At table, and the funeral-feast began."
4547,3. FUNERAL,"All night they ate the boar Serimner's flesh,"
4548,3. FUNERAL,"And from their horns, with silver rimm'd, drank mead,"
4549,3. FUNERAL,"Silent, and waited for the sacred morn."
4550,3. FUNERAL,And morning over all the world was spread.
4551,3. FUNERAL,"Then from their loathéd feasts the Gods arose,"
4552,3. FUNERAL,"And took their horses, and set forth to ride"
4553,3. FUNERAL,"O'er the bridge Bifrost, where is Heimdall's watch,"
4554,3. FUNERAL,"To the ash Igdrasil, and Ida's plain;"
4555,3. FUNERAL,"Thor came on foot, the rest on horseback rode."
4556,3. FUNERAL,And they found Mimir sitting by his fount
4557,3. FUNERAL,"Of wisdom, which beneath the ashtree springs;"
4558,3. FUNERAL,And saw the Nornies watering the roots
4559,3. FUNERAL,Of that world-shadowing tree with honey-dew.
4560,3. FUNERAL,"There came the Gods, and sate them down on stones;"
4561,3. FUNERAL,And thus the Father of the ages said:--
4562,3. FUNERAL,"""Ye Gods, the terms ye know, which Hermod brought."
4563,3. FUNERAL,Accept them or reject them! both have grounds.
4564,3. FUNERAL,"Accept them, and they bind us, unfulfill'd,"
4565,3. FUNERAL,"To leave for ever Balder in the grave,"
4566,3. FUNERAL,"An unrecover'd prisoner, shade with shades."
4567,3. FUNERAL,"But how, ye say, should the fulfilment fail?--"
4568,3. FUNERAL,"Smooth sound the terms, and light to be fulfill'd;"
4569,3. FUNERAL,For dear-beloved was Balder while he lived
4570,3. FUNERAL,"In Heaven and earth, and who would grudge him tears?"
4571,3. FUNERAL,"But from the traitorous seed of Lok they come,"
4572,3. FUNERAL,"These terms, and I suspect some hidden fraud."
4573,3. FUNERAL,"Bethink ye, Gods, is there no other way?--"
4574,3. FUNERAL,"Speak, were not this a way, the way for Gods?"
4575,3. FUNERAL,"If I, if Odin, clad in radiant arms,"
4576,3. FUNERAL,"Mounted on Sleipner, with the warrior Thor"
4577,3. FUNERAL,"Drawn in his car beside me, and my sons,"
4578,3. FUNERAL,"All the strong brood of Heaven, to swell my train,"
4579,3. FUNERAL,"Should make irruption into Hela's realm,"
4580,3. FUNERAL,"And set the fields of gloom ablaze with light,"
4581,3. FUNERAL,"And bring in triumph Balder back to Heaven?"""
4582,3. FUNERAL,"He spake, and his fierce sons applauded loud."
4583,3. FUNERAL,"But Frea, mother of the Gods, arose,"
4584,3. FUNERAL,Daughter and wife of Odin; thus she said:--
4585,3. FUNERAL,"""Odin, thou whirlwind, what a threat is this!"
4586,3. FUNERAL,"Thou threatenest what transcends thy might, even thine."
4587,3. FUNERAL,"For of all powers the mightiest far art thou,"
4588,3. FUNERAL,"Lord over men on earth, and Gods in Heaven;"
4589,3. FUNERAL,Yet even from thee thyself hath been withheld
4590,3. FUNERAL,One thing--to undo what thou thyself hast ruled.
4591,3. FUNERAL,"For all which hath been fixt, was fixt by thee."
4592,3. FUNERAL,"In the beginning, ere the Gods were born,"
4593,3. FUNERAL,"Before the Heavens were builded, thou didst slay"
4594,3. FUNERAL,"The giant Ymir, whom the abyss brought forth,"
4595,3. FUNERAL,"Thou and thy brethren fierce, the sons of Bor,"
4596,3. FUNERAL,And cast his trunk to choke the abysmal void.
4597,3. FUNERAL,But of his flesh and members thou didst build
4598,3. FUNERAL,"The earth and Ocean, and above them Heaven."
4599,3. FUNERAL,"And from the flaming world, where Muspel reigns,"
4600,3. FUNERAL,"Thou sent'st and fetched'st fire, and madest lights,"
4601,3. FUNERAL,"Sun, moon, and stars, which thou hast hung in Heaven,"
4602,3. FUNERAL,Dividing clear the paths of night and day.
4603,3. FUNERAL,"And Asgard thou didst build, and Midgard fort;"
4604,3. FUNERAL,Then me thou mad'st; of us the Gods were born.
4605,3. FUNERAL,"Last, walking by the sea, thou foundest spars"
4606,3. FUNERAL,"Of wood, and framed'st men, who till the earth,"
4607,3. FUNERAL,"Or on the sea, the field of pirates, sail."
4608,3. FUNERAL,"And all the race of Ymir thou didst drown,"
4609,3. FUNERAL,"Save one, Bergelmer;--he on shipboard fled"
4610,3. FUNERAL,"Thy deluge, and from him the giants sprang."
4611,3. FUNERAL,"But all that brood thou hast removed far off,"
4612,3. FUNERAL,And set by Ocean's utmost marge to dwell;
4613,3. FUNERAL,"But Hela into Niflheim thou threw'st,"
4614,3. FUNERAL,"And gav'st her nine unlighted worlds to rule,"
4615,3. FUNERAL,"A queen, and empire over all the dead."
4616,3. FUNERAL,"That empire wilt thou now invade, light up"
4617,3. FUNERAL,"Her darkness, from her grasp a subject tear?--"
4618,3. FUNERAL,"Try it; but I, for one, will not applaud."
4619,3. FUNERAL,"Nor do I merit, Odin, thou should'st slight"
4620,3. FUNERAL,"Me and my words, though thou be first in Heaven;"
4621,3. FUNERAL,"For I too am a Goddess, born of thee,"
4622,3. FUNERAL,"Thine eldest, and of me the Gods are sprung;"
4623,3. FUNERAL,"And all that is to come I know, but lock"
4624,3. FUNERAL,"In mine own breast, and have to none reveal'd."
4625,3. FUNERAL,"Come then! since Hela holds by right her prey,"
4626,3. FUNERAL,"But offers terms for his release to Heaven,"
4627,3. FUNERAL,Accept the chance; thou canst no more obtain.
4628,3. FUNERAL,Send through the world thy messengers; entreat
4629,3. FUNERAL,All living and unliving things to weep
4630,3. FUNERAL,For Balder; if thou haply thus may'st melt
4631,3. FUNERAL,"Hela, and win the loved one back to Heaven."""
4632,3. FUNERAL,"She spake, and on her face let fall her veil,"
4633,3. FUNERAL,"And bow'd her head, and sate with folded hands."
4634,3. FUNERAL,Nor did the all-ruling Odin slight her word;
4635,3. FUNERAL,"Straightway he spake, and thus address'd the Gods:"
4636,3. FUNERAL,"""Go quickly forth through all the world, and pray"
4637,3. FUNERAL,All living and unliving things to weep
4638,3. FUNERAL,"Balder, if haply he may thus be won."""
4639,3. FUNERAL,"When the Gods heard, they straight arose, and took"
4640,3. FUNERAL,"Their horses, and rode forth through all the world;"
4641,3. FUNERAL,"North, south, east, west, they struck, and roam'd the world,"
4642,3. FUNERAL,Entreating all things to weep Balder's death.
4643,3. FUNERAL,"And all that lived, and all without life, wept."
4644,3. FUNERAL,"And as in winter, when the frost breaks up,"
4645,3. FUNERAL,"At winter's end, before the spring begins,"
4646,3. FUNERAL,"And a warm west-wind blows, and thaw sets in--"
4647,3. FUNERAL,After an hour a dripping sound is heard
4648,3. FUNERAL,"In all the forests, and the soft-strewn snow"
4649,3. FUNERAL,"Under the trees is dibbled-thick with holes,"
4650,3. FUNERAL,And from the boughs the snowloads shuffle down;
4651,3. FUNERAL,"And, in fields sloping to the south, dark plots"
4652,3. FUNERAL,"Of grass peep out amid surrounding snow,"
4653,3. FUNERAL,"And widen, and the peasant's heart is glad--"
4654,3. FUNERAL,So through the world was heard a dripping noise
4655,3. FUNERAL,Of all things weeping to bring Balder back;
4656,3. FUNERAL,And there fell joy upon the Gods to hear.
4657,3. FUNERAL,"But Hermod rode with Niord, whom he took"
4658,3. FUNERAL,To show him spits and beaches of the sea
4659,3. FUNERAL,"Far off, where some unwarn'd might fail to weep--"
4660,3. FUNERAL,"Niord, the God of storms, whom fishers know;"
4661,3. FUNERAL,"Not born in Heaven; he was in Vanheim rear'd,"
4662,3. FUNERAL,"With men, but lives a hostage with the Gods;"
4663,3. FUNERAL,"He knows each frith, and every rocky creek"
4664,3. FUNERAL,"Fringed with dark pines, and sands where seafowl scream--"
4665,3. FUNERAL,"They two scour'd every coast, and all things wept."
4666,3. FUNERAL,"And they rode home together, through the wood"
4667,3. FUNERAL,"Of Jarnvid, which to east of Midgard lies"
4668,3. FUNERAL,"Bordering the giants, where the trees are iron;"
4669,3. FUNERAL,"There in the wood before a cave they came,"
4670,3. FUNERAL,"Where sate, in the cave's mouth, a skinny hag,"
4671,3. FUNERAL,Toothless and old; she gibes the passers by.
4672,3. FUNERAL,"Thok is she call'd, but now Lok wore her shape;"
4673,3. FUNERAL,"She greeted them the first, and laugh'd, and said:--"
4674,3. FUNERAL,"""Ye Gods, good lack, is it so dull in Heaven,"
4675,3. FUNERAL,That ye come pleasuring to Thok's iron wood?
4676,3. FUNERAL,"Lovers of change ye are, fastidious sprites."
4677,3. FUNERAL,"Look, as in some boor's yard a sweet-breath'd cow,"
4678,3. FUNERAL,"Whose manger is stuff'd full of good fresh hay,"
4679,3. FUNERAL,"Snuffs at it daintily, and stoops her head"
4680,3. FUNERAL,"To chew the straw, her litter, at her feet--"
4681,3. FUNERAL,"So ye grow squeamish, Gods, and sniff at Heaven!"""
4682,3. FUNERAL,She spake; but Hermod answer'd her and said:--
4683,3. FUNERAL,"""Thok, not for gibes we come, we come for tears."
4684,3. FUNERAL,"Balder is dead, and Hela holds her prey,"
4685,3. FUNERAL,"But will restore, if all things give him tears."
4686,3. FUNERAL,"Begrudge not thine! to all was Balder dear."""
4687,3. FUNERAL,"Then, with a louder laugh, the hag replied:--"
4688,3. FUNERAL,"""Is Balder dead? and do ye come for tears?"
4689,3. FUNERAL,Thok with dry eyes will weep o'er Balder's pyre.
4690,3. FUNERAL,"Weep him all other things, if weep they will--"
4691,3. FUNERAL,"I weep him not! let Hela keep her prey."""
4692,3. FUNERAL,"She spake, and to the cavern's depth she fled,"
4693,3. FUNERAL,Mocking; and Hermod knew their toil was vain.
4694,3. FUNERAL,"And as seafaring men, who long have wrought"
4695,3. FUNERAL,"In the great deep for gain, at last come home,"
4696,3. FUNERAL,And towards evening see the headlands rise
4697,3. FUNERAL,"Of their dear country, and can plain descry"
4698,3. FUNERAL,A fire of wither'd furze which boys have lit
4699,3. FUNERAL,"Upon the cliffs, or smoke of burning weeds"
4700,3. FUNERAL,Out of a till'd field inland;--then the wind
4701,3. FUNERAL,"Catches them, and drives out again to sea;"
4702,3. FUNERAL,And they go long days tossing up and down
4703,3. FUNERAL,"Over the grey sea-ridges, and the glimpse"
4704,3. FUNERAL,Of port they had makes bitterer far their toil--
4705,3. FUNERAL,So the Gods' cross was bitterer for their joy.
4706,3. FUNERAL,"Then, sad at heart, to Niord Hermod spake:--"
4707,3. FUNERAL,"""It is the accuser Lok, who flouts us all!"
4708,3. FUNERAL,"Ride back, and tell in Heaven this heavy news;"
4709,3. FUNERAL,"I must again below, to Hela's realm."""
4710,3. FUNERAL,He spoke; and Niord set forth back to Heaven.
4711,3. FUNERAL,"But northward Hermod rode, the way below,"
4712,3. FUNERAL,"The way he knew; and traversed Giall's stream,"
4713,3. FUNERAL,"And down to Ocean groped, and cross'd the ice,"
4714,3. FUNERAL,"And came beneath the wall, and found the grate"
4715,3. FUNERAL,Still lifted; well was his return foreknown.
4716,3. FUNERAL,And once more Hermod saw around him spread
4717,3. FUNERAL,"The joyless plains, and heard the streams of Hell."
4718,3. FUNERAL,"But as he enter'd, on the extremest bound"
4719,3. FUNERAL,"Of Niflheim, he saw one ghost come near,"
4720,3. FUNERAL,"Hovering, and stopping oft, as if afraid--"
4721,3. FUNERAL,"Hoder, the unhappy, whom his own hand slew."
4722,3. FUNERAL,"And Hermod look'd, and knew his brother's ghost,"
4723,3. FUNERAL,"And call'd him by his name, and sternly said:--"
4724,3. FUNERAL,"""Hoder, ill-fated, blind in heart and eyes!"
4725,3. FUNERAL,Why tarriest thou to plunge thee in the gulph
4726,3. FUNERAL,"Of the deep inner gloom, but flittest here,"
4727,3. FUNERAL,"In twilight, on the lonely verge of Hell,"
4728,3. FUNERAL,"Far from the other ghosts, and Hela's throne?"
4729,3. FUNERAL,"Doubtless thou fearest to meet Balder's voice,"
4730,3. FUNERAL,"Thy brother, whom through folly thou didst slay."""
4731,3. FUNERAL,"He spoke; but Hoder answer'd him, and said:--"
4732,3. FUNERAL,"""Hermod the nimble, dost thou still pursue"
4733,3. FUNERAL,"The unhappy with reproach, even in the grave?"
4734,3. FUNERAL,"For this I died, and fled beneath the gloom,"
4735,3. FUNERAL,"Not daily to endure abhorring Gods,"
4736,3. FUNERAL,Nor with a hateful presence cumber Heaven;
4737,3. FUNERAL,"And canst thou not, even here, pass pitying by?"
4738,3. FUNERAL,No less than Balder have I lost the light
4739,3. FUNERAL,"Of Heaven, and communion with my kin;"
4740,3. FUNERAL,"I too had once a wife, and once a child,"
4741,3. FUNERAL,"And substance, and a golden house in Heaven--"
4742,3. FUNERAL,"But all I left of my own act, and fled"
4743,3. FUNERAL,"Below, and dost thou hate me even here?"
4744,3. FUNERAL,"Balder upbraids me not, nor hates at all,"
4745,3. FUNERAL,"Though he has cause, have any cause; but he,"
4746,3. FUNERAL,"When that with downcast looks I hither came,"
4747,3. FUNERAL,"Stretch'd forth his hand, and with benignant voice,"
4748,3. FUNERAL,"_Welcome_, he said, _if there be welcome here,_"
4749,3. FUNERAL,_Brother and fellow-sport of Lok with me!_
4750,3. FUNERAL,"And not to offend thee, Hermod, nor to force"
4751,3. FUNERAL,"My hated converse on thee, came I up"
4752,3. FUNERAL,"From the deep gloom, where I will now return;"
4753,3. FUNERAL,"But earnestly I long'd to hover near,"
4754,3. FUNERAL,"Not too far off, when that thou camest by;"
4755,3. FUNERAL,"To feel the presence of a brother God,"
4756,3. FUNERAL,"And hear the passage of a horse of Heaven,"
4757,3. FUNERAL,"For the last time--for here thou com'st no more."""
4758,3. FUNERAL,"He spake, and turn'd to go to the inner gloom."
4759,3. FUNERAL,"But Hermod stay'd him with mild words, and said:--"
4760,3. FUNERAL,"""Thou doest well to chide me, Hoder blind!"
4761,3. FUNERAL,"Truly thou say'st, the planning guilty mind"
4762,3. FUNERAL,Was Lok's; the unwitting hand alone was thine.
4763,3. FUNERAL,But Gods are like the sons of men in this--
4764,3. FUNERAL,"When they have woe, they blame the nearest cause."
4765,3. FUNERAL,"Howbeit stay, and be appeased! and tell:"
4766,3. FUNERAL,"Sits Balder still in pomp by Hela's side,"
4767,3. FUNERAL,"Or is he mingled with the unnumber'd dead?"""
4768,3. FUNERAL,And the blind Hoder answer'd him and spake:--
4769,3. FUNERAL,"""His place of state remains by Hela's side,"
4770,3. FUNERAL,"But empty; for his wife, for Nanna came"
4771,3. FUNERAL,"Lately below, and join'd him; and the pair"
4772,3. FUNERAL,Frequent the still recesses of the realm
4773,3. FUNERAL,"Of Hela, and hold converse undisturb'd."
4774,3. FUNERAL,"But they too, doubtless, will have breathed the balm,"
4775,3. FUNERAL,"Which floats before a visitant from Heaven,"
4776,3. FUNERAL,"And have drawn upward to this verge of Hell."""
4777,3. FUNERAL,"He spake; and, as he ceased, a puff of wind"
4778,3. FUNERAL,Roll'd heavily the leaden mist aside
4779,3. FUNERAL,"Round where they stood, and they beheld two forms"
4780,3. FUNERAL,Make toward them o'er the stretching cloudy plain.
4781,3. FUNERAL,"And Hermod straight perceived them, who they were"
4782,3. FUNERAL,Balder and Nanna; and to Balder said:--
4783,3. FUNERAL,"""Balder, too truly thou foresaw'st a snare!"
4784,3. FUNERAL,"Lok triumphs still, and Hela keeps her prey."
4785,3. FUNERAL,"No more to Asgard shalt thou come, nor lodge"
4786,3. FUNERAL,"In thy own house, Breidablik, nor enjoy"
4787,3. FUNERAL,"The love all bear toward thee, nor train up"
4788,3. FUNERAL,"Forset, thy son, to be beloved like thee."
4789,3. FUNERAL,"Here must thou lie, and wait an endless age."
4790,3. FUNERAL,"Therefore for the last time, O Balder, hail!"""
4791,3. FUNERAL,"He spake; and Balder answer'd him, and said:--"
4792,3. FUNERAL,"""Hail and farewell! for here thou com'st no more."
4793,3. FUNERAL,"Yet mourn not for me, Hermod, when thou sitt'st"
4794,3. FUNERAL,"In Heaven, nor let the other Gods lament,"
4795,3. FUNERAL,"As wholly to be pitied, quite forlorn."
4796,3. FUNERAL,"For Nanna hath rejoin'd me, who, of old,"
4797,3. FUNERAL,"In Heaven, was seldom parted from my side;"
4798,3. FUNERAL,"And still the acceptance follows me, which crown'd"
4799,3. FUNERAL,"My former life, and cheers me even here."
4800,3. FUNERAL,The iron frown of Hela is relax'd
4801,3. FUNERAL,"When I draw nigh, and the wan tribes of dead"
4802,3. FUNERAL,"Love me, and gladly bring for my award"
4803,3. FUNERAL,Their ineffectual feuds and feeble hates--
4804,3. FUNERAL,"Shadows of hates, but they distress them still."""
4805,3. FUNERAL,And the fleet-footed Hermod made reply:--
4806,3. FUNERAL,"""Thou hast then all the solace death allows,"
4807,3. FUNERAL,Esteem and function; and so far is well.
4808,3. FUNERAL,"Yet here thou liest, Balder, underground,"
4809,3. FUNERAL,"Rusting for ever; and the years roll on,"
4810,3. FUNERAL,"The generations pass, the ages grow,"
4811,3. FUNERAL,And bring us nearer to the final day
4812,3. FUNERAL,When from the south shall march the fiery band
4813,3. FUNERAL,"And cross the bridge of Heaven, with Lok for guide,"
4814,3. FUNERAL,And Fenris at his heel with broken chain;
4815,3. FUNERAL,While from the east the giant Rymer steers
4816,3. FUNERAL,"His ship, and the great serpent makes to land;"
4817,3. FUNERAL,And all are marshall'd in one flaming square
4818,3. FUNERAL,"Against the Gods, upon the plains of Heaven,"
4819,3. FUNERAL,"I mourn thee, that thou canst not help us then."""
4820,3. FUNERAL,"He spake; but Balder answer'd him, and said:--"
4821,3. FUNERAL,"""Mourn not for me! Mourn, Hermod, for the Gods;"
4822,3. FUNERAL,"Mourn for the men on earth, the Gods in Heaven,"
4823,3. FUNERAL,"Who live, and with their eyes shall see that day!"
4824,3. FUNERAL,"The day will come, when fall shall Asgard's towers,"
4825,3. FUNERAL,"And Odin, and his sons, the seed of Heaven;"
4826,3. FUNERAL,"But what were I, to save them in that hour?"
4827,3. FUNERAL,"If strength might save them, could not Odin save,"
4828,3. FUNERAL,"My father, and his pride, the warrior Thor,"
4829,3. FUNERAL,"Vidar the silent, the impetuous Tyr?"
4830,3. FUNERAL,"I, what were I, when these can nought avail?"
4831,3. FUNERAL,"Yet, doubtless, when the day of battle comes,"
4832,3. FUNERAL,"And the two hosts are marshall'd, and in Heaven"
4833,3. FUNERAL,"The golden-crested cock shall sound alarm,"
4834,3. FUNERAL,"And his black brother-bird from hence reply,"
4835,3. FUNERAL,"And bucklers clash, and spears begin to pour--"
4836,3. FUNERAL,"Longing will stir within my breast, though vain."
4837,3. FUNERAL,"But not to me so grievous, as, I know,"
4838,3. FUNERAL,"To other Gods it were, is my enforced"
4839,3. FUNERAL,Absence from fields where I could nothing aid;
4840,3. FUNERAL,For I am long since weary of your storm
4841,3. FUNERAL,"Of carnage, and find, Hermod, in your life"
4842,3. FUNERAL,"Something too much of war and broils, which make"
4843,3. FUNERAL,"Life one perpetual fight, a bath of blood."
4844,3. FUNERAL,Mine eyes are dizzy with the arrowy hail;
4845,3. FUNERAL,"Mine ears are stunn'd with blows, and sick for calm."
4846,3. FUNERAL,"Inactive therefore let me lie, in gloom,"
4847,3. FUNERAL,"Unarm'd, inglorious; I attend the course"
4848,3. FUNERAL,"Of ages, and my late return to light,"
4849,3. FUNERAL,"In times less alien to a spirit mild,"
4850,3. FUNERAL,"In new-recover'd seats, the happier day."""
4851,3. FUNERAL,He spake; and the fleet Hermod thus replied:--
4852,3. FUNERAL,"""Brother, what seats are these, what happier day?"
4853,3. FUNERAL,"Tell me, that I may ponder it when gone."""
4854,3. FUNERAL,And the ray-crowned Balder answer'd him:--
4855,3. FUNERAL,"""Far to the south, beyond the blue, there spreads"
4856,3. FUNERAL,"Another Heaven, the boundless--no one yet"
4857,3. FUNERAL,Hath reach'd it; there hereafter shall arise
4858,3. FUNERAL,"The second Asgard, with another name."
4859,3. FUNERAL,"Thither, when o'er this present earth and Heavens"
4860,3. FUNERAL,"The tempest of the latter days hath swept,"
4861,3. FUNERAL,"And they from sight have disappear'd, and sunk,"
4862,3. FUNERAL,Shall a small remnant of the Gods repair;
4863,3. FUNERAL,Hoder and I shall join them from the grave.
4864,3. FUNERAL,There re-assembling we shall see emerge
4865,3. FUNERAL,From the bright Ocean at our feet an earth
4866,3. FUNERAL,"More fresh, more verdant than the last, with fruits"
4867,3. FUNERAL,"Self-springing, and a seed of man preserved,"
4868,3. FUNERAL,"Who then shall live in peace, as now in war."
4869,3. FUNERAL,But we in Heaven shall find again with joy
4870,3. FUNERAL,"The ruin'd palaces of Odin, seats"
4871,3. FUNERAL,"Familiar, halls where we have supp'd of old;"
4872,3. FUNERAL,"Re-enter them with wonder, never fill"
4873,3. FUNERAL,"Our eyes with gazing, and rebuild with tears."
4874,3. FUNERAL,And we shall tread once more the well-known plain
4875,3. FUNERAL,"Of Ida, and among the grass shall find"
4876,3. FUNERAL,The golden dice wherewith we play'd of yore;
4877,3. FUNERAL,And that will bring to mind the former life
4878,3. FUNERAL,"And pastime of the Gods, the wise discourse"
4879,3. FUNERAL,"Of Odin, the delights of other days,"
4880,3. FUNERAL,"O Hermod, pray that thou may'st join us then!"
4881,3. FUNERAL,"Such for the future is my hope; meanwhile,"
4882,3. FUNERAL,"I rest the thrall of Hela, and endure"
4883,3. FUNERAL,"Death, and the gloom which round me even now"
4884,3. FUNERAL,"Thickens, and to its inner gulph recalls."
4885,3. FUNERAL,"Farewell, for longer speech is not allow'd!"""
4886,3. FUNERAL,"He spoke, and waved farewell, and gave his hand"
4887,3. FUNERAL,To Nanna; and she gave their brother blind
4888,3. FUNERAL,"Her hand, in turn, for guidance; and the three"
4889,3. FUNERAL,"Departed o'er the cloudy plain, and soon"
4890,3. FUNERAL,Faded from sight into the interior gloom.
4891,3. FUNERAL,"But Hermod stood beside his drooping horse,"
4892,3. FUNERAL,"Mute, gazing after them in tears; and fain,"
4893,3. FUNERAL,"Fain had he follow'd their receding steps,"
4894,3. FUNERAL,"Though they to death were bound, and he to Heaven,"
4895,3. FUNERAL,Then; but a power he could not break withheld.
4896,3. FUNERAL,"And as a stork which idle boys have trapp'd,"
4897,3. FUNERAL,"And tied him in a yard, at autumn sees"
4898,3. FUNERAL,Flocks of his kind pass flying o'er his head
4899,3. FUNERAL,"To warmer lands, and coasts that keep the sun;--"
4900,3. FUNERAL,"He strains to join their flight, and from his shed"
4901,3. FUNERAL,Follows them with a long complaining cry--
4902,3. FUNERAL,"So Hermod gazed, and yearn'd to join his kin."
4903,3. FUNERAL,
4904,3. FUNERAL,"At last he sigh'd, and set forth back to Heaven."

4943,I,"Though the locks are yet brown on his noble head,"
4944,I,"Propt on pillows in his bed,"
4945,I,Gazing seaward for the light
4946,I,Of some ship that fights the gale
4947,I,On this wild December night?
4948,I,Over the sick man's feet is spread
4949,I,A dark green forest-dress;
4950,I,"A gold harp leans against the bed,"
4951,I,Ruddy in the fire's light.
4952,I,"I know him by his harp of gold,"
4953,I,Famous in Arthur's court of old;
4954,I,I know him by his forest-dress--
4955,I,"The peerless hunter, harper, knight,"
4956,I,Tristram of Lyoness.
4957,I,
4958,I,"What Lady is this, whose silk attire"
4959,I,Gleams so rich in the light of the fire?
4960,I,The ringlets on her shoulders lying
4961,I,In their flitting lustre vying
4962,I,With the clasp of burnish'd gold
4963,I,Which her heavy robe doth hold.
4964,I,"Her looks are mild, her fingers slight"
4965,I,As the driven snow are white;
4966,I,But her cheeks are sunk and pale.
4967,I,Is it that the bleak sea-gale
4968,I,Beating from the Atlantic sea
4969,I,"On this coast of Brittany,"
4970,I,Nips too keenly the sweet flower?
4971,I,Is it that a deep fatigue
4972,I,"Hath come on her, a chilly fear,"
4973,I,Passing all her youthful hour
4974,I,"Spinning with her maidens here,"
4975,I,Listlessly through the window-bars
4976,I,"Gazing seawards many a league,"
4977,I,"From her lonely shore-built tower,"
4978,I,While the knights are at the wars?
4979,I,"Or, perhaps, has her young heart"
4980,I,"Felt already some deeper smart,"
4981,I,"Of those that in secret the heart-strings rive,"
4982,I,"Leaving her sunk and pale, though fair?"
4983,I,Who is this snowdrop by the sea?--
4984,I,"I know her by her mildness rare,"
4985,I,"Her snow-white hands, her golden hair;"
4986,I,"I know her by her rich silk dress,"
4987,I,And her fragile loveliness--
4988,I,"The sweetest Christian soul alive,"
4989,I,Iseult of Brittany.
4990,I,
4991,I,Iseult of Brittany?--but where
4992,I,"Is that other Iseult fair,"
4993,I,"That proud, first Iseult, Cornwall's queen?"
4994,I,"She, whom Tristram's ship of yore"
4995,I,"From Ireland to Cornwall bore,"

5000,I,Which since then for ever rolls
5001,I,"Through their blood, and binds their souls,"
5002,I,"Working love, but working teen?--"
5003,I,There were two Iseults who did sway
5004,I,Each her hour of Tristram's day;
5005,I,"But one possess'd his waning time,"
5006,I,The other his resplendent prime.
5007,I,"Behold her here, the patient flower,"
5008,I,Who possess'd his darker hour!
5009,I,Iseult of the Snow-White Hand

5024,I,And his spirit is not clear.
5025,I,"Hark! he mutters in his sleep,"
5026,I,"As he wanders far from here,"
5027,I,"Changes place and time of year,"
5028,I,And his closéd eye doth sweep
5029,I,"O'er some fair unwintry sea,"
5030,I,"Not this fierce Atlantic deep,"
5031,I,While he mutters brokenly:--
5032,I,

5034,I,
5035,I,"The calm sea shines, loose hang the vessel's sails;"

5052,I,"Thinn'd and paled before his time,"
5053,I,But the brilliant youthful knight
5054,I,"In the glory of his prime,"
5055,I,"Sitting in the gilded barge,"
5056,I,"At thy side, thou lovely charge,"
5057,I,"Bending gaily o'er thy hand,"
5058,I,Iseult of Ireland!
5059,I,"And she too, that princess fair,"
5060,I,"If her bloom be now less rare,"
5061,I,Let her have her youth again--
5062,I,Let her be as she was then!
5063,I,"Let her have her proud dark eyes,"
5064,I,And her petulant quick replies--
5065,I,Let her sweep her dazzling hand
5066,I,"With its gesture of command,"
5067,I,And shake back her raven hair
5068,I,With the old imperious air!
5069,I,"As of old, so let her be,"
5070,I,"That first Iseult, princess bright,"
5071,I,Chatting with her youthful knight
5072,I,"As he steers her o'er the sea,"
5073,I,Quitting at her father's will
5074,I,"The green isle where she was bred,"
5075,I,"And her bower in Ireland,"
5076,I,For the surge-beat Cornish strand;
5077,I,Where the prince whom she must wed
5078,I,"Dwells on loud Tyntagel's hill,"
5079,I,High above the sounding sea.
5080,I,And that potion rare her mother
5081,I,"Gave her, that her future lord,"
5082,I,"Gave her, that King Marc and she,"
5083,I,"Might drink it on their marriage-day,"
5084,I,And for ever love each other--
5085,I,"Let her, as she sits on board,"
5086,I,"Ah, sweet saints, unwittingly!"
5087,I,"See it shine, and take it up,"
5088,I,And to Tristram laughing say:
5089,I,"""Sir Tristram, of thy courtesy,"
5090,I,"Pledge me in my golden cup!"""
5091,I,Let them drink it--let their hands
5092,I,"Tremble, and their cheeks be flame,"
5093,I,As they feel the fatal bands
5094,I,"Of a love they dare not name,"
5095,I,"With a wild delicious pain,"
5096,I,Twine about their hearts again!
5097,I,Let the early summer be
5098,I,"Once more round them, and the sea"
5099,I,"Blue, and o'er its mirror kind"
5100,I,"Let the breath of the May-wind,"
5101,I,"Wandering through their drooping sails,"
5102,I,Die on the green fields of Wales!

5110,I,Were feet like those made for so wild a way?
5111,I,"The southern winter-parlour, by my fay,"

5131,I,"And this rough December-night,"
5132,I,"And his burning fever-pain,"
5133,I,"Mingle with his hurrying dream,"
5134,I,"Till they rule it, till he seem"
5135,I,"The press'd fugitive again,"
5136,I,The love-desperate banish'd knight
5137,I,With a fire in his brain
5138,I,Flying o'er the stormy main.
5139,I,--Whither does he wander now?
5140,I,Haply in his dreams the wind
5141,I,"Wafts him here, and lets him find"
5142,I,The lovely orphan child again
5143,I,In her castle by the coast;
5144,I,"The youngest, fairest chatelaine,"
5145,I,"Whom this realm of France can boast,"
5146,I,"Our snowdrop by the Atlantic sea,"
5147,I,Iseult of Brittany.
5148,I,"And--for through the haggard air,"
5149,I,"The stain'd arms, the matted hair"
5150,I,"Of that stranger-knight ill-starr'd,"
5151,I,"There gleam'd something, which recall'd"
5152,I,The Tristram who in better days
5153,I,Was Launcelot's guest at Joyous Gard--
5154,I,"Welcomed here, and here install'd,"
5155,I,"Tended of his fever here,"
5156,I,Haply he seems again to move
5157,I,His young guardian's heart with love;
5158,I,"In his exiled loneliness,"
5159,I,"In his stately, deep distress,"
5160,I,"Without a word, without a tear."
5161,I,--Ah! 'tis well he should retrace
5162,I,His tranquil life in this lone place;
5163,I,His gentle bearing at the side
5164,I,Of his timid youthful bride;
5165,I,His long rambles by the shore
5166,I,"On winter-evenings, when the roar"
5167,I,"Of the near waves came, sadly grand,"
5168,I,"Through the dark, up the drown'd sand,"
5169,I,Or his endless reveries
5170,I,"In the woods, where the gleams play"
5171,I,"On the grass under the trees,"
5172,I,Passing the long summer's day
5173,I,Idle as a mossy stone
5174,I,"In the forest-depths alone,"
5175,I,"The chase neglected, and his hound"
5176,I,Couch'd beside him on the ground.
5177,I,--Ah! what trouble's on his brow?
5178,I,Hither let him wander now;
5179,I,"Hither, to the quiet hours"
5180,I,Pass'd among these heaths of ours
5181,I,By the grey Atlantic sea;
5182,I,"Hours, if not of ecstasy,"
5183,I,From violent anguish surely free!
5184,I,
5185,I,_Tristram_
5186,I,
5187,I,"All red with blood the whirling river flows,"
5188,I,"The wide plain rings, the dazed air throbs with blows."
5189,I,Upon us are the chivalry of Rome--
5190,I,"Their spears are down, their steeds are bathed in foam."
5191,I,"""Up, Tristram, up,"" men cry, ""thou moonstruck knight!"
5192,I,"What foul fiend rides thee? On into the fight!"""
5193,I,--Above the din her voice is in my ears;
5194,I,I see her form glide through the crossing spears.--
5195,I,Iseult!...
5196,I,
5197,I,*       *       *       *       *
5198,I,
5199,I,Ah! he wanders forth again;
5200,I,"We cannot keep him; now, as then,"
5201,I,There's a secret in his breast
5202,I,Which will never let him rest.
5203,I,These musing fits in the green wood
5204,I,"They cloud the brain, they dull the blood!"
5205,I,"--His sword is sharp, his horse is good;"
5206,I,Beyond the mountains will he see
5207,I,"The famous towns of Italy,"
5208,I,And label with the blessed sign
5209,I,The heathen Saxons on the Rhine.
5210,I,At Arthur's side he fights once more
5211,I,With the Roman Emperor.
5212,I,There's many a gay knight where he goes
5213,I,Will help him to forget his care;
5214,I,"The march, the leaguer, Heaven's blithe air,"
5215,I,"The neighing steeds, the ringing blows--"
5216,I,Sick pining comes not where these are.
5217,I,"Ah! what boots it, that the jest"
5218,I,"Lightens every other brow,"
5219,I,"What, that every other breast"
5220,I,"Dances as the trumpets blow,"
5221,I,If one's own heart beats not light
5222,I,"On the waves of the toss'd fight,"
5223,I,If oneself cannot get free
5224,I,From the clog of misery?
5225,I,Thy lovely youthful wife grows pale
5226,I,Watching by the salt sea-tide
5227,I,With her children at her side
5228,I,For the gleam of thy white sail.
5229,I,"Home, Tristram, to thy halls again!"
5230,I,"To our lonely sea complain,"
5231,I,To our forests tell thy pain!
5232,I,
5233,I,_Tristram_
5234,I,
5235,I,"All round the forest sweeps off, black in shade,"
5236,I,But it is moonlight in the open glade;
5237,I,And in the bottom of the glade shine clear
5238,I,The forest-chapel and the fountain near.
5239,I,"--I think, I have a fever in my blood;"
5240,I,"Come, let me leave the shadow of this wood,"
5241,I,"Ride down, and bathe my hot brow in the flood."
5242,I,--Mild shines the cold spring in the moon's clear light;
5243,I,God! 'tis _her_ face plays in the waters bright.
5244,I,"""Fair love,"" she says, ""canst thou forget so soon,"
5245,I,"At this soft hour, under this sweet moon?""--"
5246,I,Iseult!...
5247,I,
5248,I,*       *       *       *       *
5249,I,
5250,I,"Ah, poor soul! if this be so,"
5251,I,Only death can balm thy woe.
5252,I,The solitudes of the green wood
5253,I,Had no medicine for thy mood;
5254,I,The rushing battle clear'd thy blood
5255,I,As little as did solitude.
5256,I,--Ah! his eyelids slowly break
5257,I,"Their hot seals, and let him wake;"
5258,I,What new change shall we now see?
5259,I,A happier? Worse it cannot be.
5260,I,
5261,I,_Tristram_
5262,I,
5263,I,"Is my page here? Come, turn me to the fire!"
5264,I,Upon the window-panes the moon shines bright;
5265,I,The wind is down--but she'll not come to-night.
5266,I,"Ah no! she is asleep in Cornwall now,"
5267,I,Far hence; her dreams are fair--smooth is her brow
5268,I,"Of me she recks not, nor my vain desire."
5269,I,"--I have had dreams, I have had dreams, my page,"
5270,I,Would take a score years from a strong man's age;
5271,I,"And with a blood like mine, will leave, I fear,"
5272,I,Scant leisure for a second messenger.
5273,I,"--My princess, art thou there? Sweet, do not wait!"
5274,I,"To bed, and sleep! my fever is gone by;"
5275,I,To-night my page shall keep me company.
5276,I,Where do the children sleep? kiss them for me!
5277,I,"Poor child, thou art almost as pale as I;"
5278,I,This comes of nursing long and watching late.
5279,I,To bed--good night!
5280,I,
5281,I,*       *       *       *       *
5282,I,
5283,I,"She left the gleam-lit fireplace,"
5284,I,She came to the bed-side;
5285,I,She took his hands in hers--her tears
5286,I,Down on his wasted fingers rain'd.
5287,I,She raised her eyes upon his face--
5288,I,"Not with a look of wounded pride,"
5289,I,A look as if the heart complained--
5290,I,Her look was like a sad embrace;
5291,I,The gaze of one who can divine
5292,I,"A grief, and sympathise."
5293,I,Sweet flower! thy children's eyes
5294,I,Are not more innocent than thine.
5295,I,"But they sleep in shelter'd rest,"
5296,I,"Like helpless birds in the warm nest,"
5297,I,On the castle's southern side;
5298,I,Where feebly comes the mournful roar
5299,I,Of buffeting wind and surging tide
5300,I,Through many a room and corridor.
5301,I,--Full on their window the moon's ray
5302,I,Makes their chamber as bright as day.
5303,I,"It shines upon the blank white walls,"
5304,I,"And on the snowy pillow falls,"
5305,I,And on two angel-heads doth play
5306,I,"Turn'd to each other--the eyes closed,"
5307,I,The lashes on the cheeks reposed.
5308,I,Round each sweet brow the cap close-set
5309,I,Hardly lets peep the golden hair;
5310,I,Through the soft-open'd lips the air
5311,I,Scarcely moves the coverlet.
5312,I,One little wandering arm is thrown
5313,I,"At random on the counterpane,"
5314,I,And often the fingers close in haste
5315,I,As if their baby-owner chased
5316,I,The butterflies again.
5317,I,"This stir they have, and this alone;"
5318,I,But else they are so still!
5319,I,"--Ah, tired madcaps! you lie still;"
5320,I,"But were you at the window now,"
5321,I,To look forth on the fairy sight
5322,I,"Of your illumined haunts by night,"
5323,I,To see the park-glades where you play
5324,I,"Far lovelier than they are by day,"
5325,I,"To see the sparkle on the eaves,"
5326,I,And upon every giant-bough
5327,I,"Of those old oaks, whose wet red leaves"
5328,I,Are jewell'd with bright drops of rain--
5329,I,How would your voices run again!
5330,I,And far beyond the sparkling trees
5331,I,Of the castle-park one sees
5332,I,"The bare heaths spreading, clear as day,"
5333,I,"Moor behind moor, far, far away,"
5334,I,Into the heart of Brittany.
5335,I,"And here and there, lock'd by the land,"
5336,I,"Long inlets of smooth glittering sea,"
5337,I,And many a stretch of watery sand
5338,I,All shining in the white moon-beams--
5339,I,But you see fairer in your dreams!
5340,I,
5341,I,What voices are these on the clear night-air?
5342,I,What lights in the court--what steps on the stair?
5343,I,
5344,I,
5345,II,II
5346,II,
5347,II,Iseult of Ireland
5348,II,
5349,II,_Tristram_
5350,II,
5351,II,"Raise the light, my page! that I may see her.--"
5352,II,"Thou art come at last, then, haughty Queen!"
5353,II,"Long I've waited, long I've fought my fever;"
5354,II,"Late thou comest, cruel thou hast been."
5355,II,
5356,II,_Iseult_
5357,II,
5358,II,"Blame me not, poor sufferer! that I tarried;"
5359,II,"Bound I was, I could not break the band."
5360,II,"Chide not with the past, but feel the present!"
5361,II,I am here--we meet--I hold thy hand.
5362,II,
5363,II,_Tristram_
5364,II,
5365,II,"Thou art come, indeed--thou hast rejoin'd me;"
5366,II,Thou hast dared it--but too late to save.
5367,II,Fear not now that men should tax thine honour!
5368,II,I am dying: build--(thou may'st)--my grave!
5369,II,
5370,II,_Iseult_
5371,II,
5372,II,"Tristram, ah, for love of Heaven, speak kindly!"
5373,II,"What, I hear these bitter words from thee?"
5374,II,"Sick with grief I am, and faint with travel--"
5375,II,"Take my hand--dear Tristram, look on me!"
5376,II,
5377,II,_Tristram_
5378,II,
5379,II,"I forgot, thou comest from thy voyage--"
5380,II,"Yes, the spray is on thy cloak and hair."
5381,II,"But thy dark eyes are not dimm'd, proud Iseult!"
5382,II,And thy beauty never was more fair.
5383,II,
5384,II,_Iseult_
5385,II,
5386,II,"Ah, harsh flatterer! let alone my beauty!"
5387,II,"I, like thee, have left my youth afar."
5388,II,"Take my hand, and touch these wasted fingers--"
5389,II,"See my cheek and lips, how white they are!"
5390,II,
5391,II,_Tristram_
5392,II,
5393,II,"Thou art paler--but thy sweet charm, Iseult!"
5394,II,Would not fade with the dull years away.
5395,II,"Ah, how fair thou standest in the moonlight!"
5396,II,"I forgive thee, Iseult!--thou wilt stay?"
5397,II,
5398,II,_Iseult_
5399,II,
5400,II,"Fear me not, I will be always with thee;"
5401,II,"I will watch thee, tend thee, soothe thy pain;"
5402,II,"Sing thee tales of true, long-parted lovers,"
5403,II,Join'd at evening of their days again.
5404,II,
5405,II,_Tristram_
5406,II,
5407,II,"No, thou shalt not speak! I should be finding"
5408,II,Something alter'd in thy courtly tone.
5409,II,"Sit--sit by me! I will think, we've lived so"
5410,II,"In the green wood, all our lives, alone."
5411,II,
5412,II,_Iseult_
5413,II,
5414,II,"Alter'd, Tristram? Not in courts, believe me,"
5415,II,Love like mine is alter'd in the breast;
5416,II,Courtly life is light and cannot reach it--
5417,II,"Ah! it lives, because so deep-suppress'd!"
5418,II,
5419,II,"What, thou think'st men speak in courtly chambers"
5420,II,Words by which the wretched are consoled?
5421,II,"What, thou think'st this aching brow was cooler,"
5422,II,"Circled, Tristram, by a band of gold?"
5423,II,
5424,II,"Royal state with Marc, my deep-wrong'd husband--"
5425,II,That was bliss to make my sorrows flee!
5426,II,Silken courtiers whispering honied nothings--
5427,II,Those were friends to make me false to thee!
5428,II,
5429,II,"Ah, on which, if both our lots were balanced,"
5430,II,Was indeed the heaviest burden thrown--
5431,II,"Thee, a pining exile in thy forest,"
5432,II,"Me, a smiling queen upon my throne?"
5433,II,
5434,II,"Vain and strange debate, where both have suffer'd"
5435,II,"Both have pass'd a youth consumed and sad,"
5436,II,"Both have brought their anxious day to evening,"
5437,II,And have now short space for being glad!
5438,II,
5439,II,"Join'd we are henceforth; nor will thy people,"
5440,II,"Nor thy younger Iseult take it ill,"
5441,II,"That a former rival shares her office,"
5442,II,"When she sees her humbled, pale, and still."
5443,II,
5444,II,"I, a faded watcher by thy pillow,"
5445,II,"I, a statue on thy chapel-floor,"
5446,II,"Pour'd in prayer before the Virgin-Mother,"
5447,II,"Rouse no anger, make no rivals more."
5448,II,
5449,II,"She will cry: ""Is this the foe I dreaded?"
5450,II,This his idol? this that royal bride?
5451,II,"Ah, an hour of health would purge his eyesight!"
5452,II,"Stay, pale queen! for ever by my side."""
5453,II,
5454,II,"Hush, no words! that smile, I see, forgives me."
5455,II,"I am now thy nurse, I bid thee sleep."
5456,II,Close thine eyes--this flooding moonlight blinds them!--
5457,II,"Nay, all's well again! thou must not weep."
5458,II,
5459,II,_Tristram_
5460,II,
5461,II,"I am happy! yet I feel, there's something"
5462,II,"Swells my heart, and takes my breath away."
5463,II,Through a mist I see thee; near--come nearer!
5464,II,Bend--bend down!--I yet have much to say.
5465,II,
5466,II,_Iseult_
5467,II,
5468,II,Heaven! his head sinks back upon the pillow--
5469,II,Tristram! Tristram! let thy heart not fail!
5470,II,Call on God and on the holy angels!
5471,II,"What, love, courage!--Christ! he is so pale."
5472,II,
5473,II,_Tristram_
5474,II,
5475,II,"Hush, 'tis vain, I feel my end approaching!"
5476,II,"This is what my mother said should be,"
5477,II,"When the fierce pains took her in the forest,"
5478,II,"The deep draughts of death, in bearing me."
5479,II,
5480,II,"""Son,"" she said, ""thy name shall be of sorrow;"
5481,II,"Tristram art thou call'd for my death's sake."""
5482,II,"So she said, and died in the drear forest."
5483,II,Grief since then his home with me doth make.
5484,II,
5485,II,"I am dying.--Start not, nor look wildly!"
5486,II,"Me, thy living friend, thou canst not save."
5487,II,"But, since living we were ununited,"
5488,II,"Go not far, O Iseult! from my grave."
5489,II,
5490,II,"Close mine eyes, then seek the princess Iseult;"
5491,II,"Speak her fair, she is of royal blood!"
5492,II,"Say, I will'd so, that thou stay beside me--"
5493,II,She will grant it; she is kind and good.
5494,II,
5495,II,Now to sail the seas of death I leave thee--
5496,II,One last kiss upon the living shore!
5497,II,
5498,II,_Iseult_
5499,II,
5500,II,Tristram!--Tristram!--stay--receive me with thee!
5501,II,"Iseult leaves thee, Tristram! never more."
5502,II,
5503,II,*       *       *       *       *
5504,II,
5505,II,You see them clear--the moon shines bright.
5506,II,"Slow, slow and softly, where she stood,"
5507,II,She sinks upon the ground;--her hood
5508,II,Had fallen back; her arms outspread
5509,II,Still hold her lover's hand; her head
5510,II,"Is bow'd, half-buried, on the bed."
5511,II,O'er the blanch'd sheet her raven hair
5512,II,"Lies in disorder'd streams; and there,"
5513,II,"Strung like white stars, the pearls still are,"
5514,II,"And the golden bracelets, heavy and rare,"
5515,II,Flash on her white arms still.
5516,II,The very same which yesternight
5517,II,"Flash'd in the silver sconces' light,"
5518,II,When the feast was gay and the laughter loud
5519,II,In Tyntagel's palace proud.
5520,II,But then they deck'd a restless ghost
5521,II,"With hot-flush'd cheeks and brilliant eyes,"
5522,II,And quivering lips on which the tide
5523,II,"Of courtly speech abruptly died,"
5524,II,"And a glance which over the crowded floor,"
5525,II,"The dancers, and the festive host,"
5526,II,Flew ever to the door.
5527,II,"That the knights eyed her in surprise,"
5528,II,And the dames whispered scoffingly:
5529,II,"""Her moods, good lack, they pass like showers!"
5530,II,But yesternight and she would be
5531,II,"As pale and still as wither'd flowers,"
5532,II,And now to-night she laughs and speaks
5533,II,And has a colour in her cheeks;
5534,II,"Christ keep us from such fantasy!""--"
5535,II,
5536,II,"Yes, now the longing is o'erpast,"
5537,II,"Which, dogg'd by fear and fought by shame,"
5538,II,"Shook her weak bosom day and night,"
5539,II,"Consumed her beauty like a flame,"
5540,II,And dimm'd it like the desert-blast.
5541,II,"And though the bed-clothes hide her face,"
5542,II,"Yet were it lifted to the light,"
5543,II,The sweet expression of her brow
5544,II,"Would charm the gazer, till his thought"
5545,II,"Erased the ravages of time,"
5546,II,"Fill'd up the hollow cheek, and brought"
5547,II,A freshness back as of her prime--
5548,II,So healing is her quiet now.
5549,II,So perfectly the lines express
5550,II,"A tranquil, settled loveliness,"
5551,II,Her younger rival's purest grace.
5552,II,
5553,II,The air of the December-night
5554,II,"Steals coldly around the chamber bright,"
5555,II,Where those lifeless lovers be;
5556,II,"Swinging with it, in the light"
5557,II,Flaps the ghostlike tapestry.
5558,II,And on the arras wrought you see
5559,II,"A stately Huntsman, clad in green,"
5560,II,And round him a fresh forest-scene.
5561,II,"On that clear forest-knoll he stays,"
5562,II,"With his pack round him, and delays."
5563,II,"He stares and stares, with troubled face,"
5564,II,"At this huge, gleam-lit fireplace,"
5565,II,"At that bright, iron-figured door,"
5566,II,And those blown rushes on the floor.
5567,II,He gazes down into the room
5568,II,"With heated cheeks and flurried air,"
5569,II,And to himself he seems to say:
5570,II,"""_What place is this, and who are they?_"
5571,II,_Who is that kneeling Lady fair?_
5572,II,_And on his pillows that pale Knight_
5573,II,_Who seems of marble on a tomb?_
5574,II,"_How comes it here, this chamber bright,_"
5575,II,_Through whose mullion'd windows clear_
5576,II,"_The castle-court all wet with rain,_"
5577,II,"_The drawbridge and the moat appear,_"
5578,II,"_And then the beach, and, mark'd with spray,_"
5579,II,"_The sunken reefs, and far away_"
5580,II,_The unquiet bright Atlantic plain?_
5581,II,"_--What, has some glamour made me sleep,_"
5582,II,"_And sent me with my dogs to sweep,_"
5583,II,"_By night, with boisterous bugle-peal,_"
5584,II,"_Through some old, sea-side, knightly hall,_"
5585,II,_Not in the free green wood at all?_
5586,II,"_That Knight's asleep, and at her prayer_"
5587,II,_That Lady by the bed doth kneel--_
5588,II,"_Then hush, thou boisterous bugle-peal!_"""
5589,II,--The wild boar rustles in his lair;
5590,II,The fierce hounds snuff the tainted air;
5591,II,But lord and hounds keep rooted there.
5592,II,
5593,II,"Cheer, cheer thy dogs into the brake,"
5594,II,O Hunter! and without a fear
5595,II,"Thy golden-tassell'd bugle blow,"
5596,II,And through the glades thy pastime take--
5597,II,For thou wilt rouse no sleepers here!
5598,II,For these thou seest are unmoved;
5599,II,"Cold, cold as those who lived and loved"
5600,II,A thousand years ago.
5601,II,
5602,II,
5603,III,III
5604,III,
5605,III,Iseult of Brittany
5606,III,
5607,III,"A year had flown, and o'er the sea away,"
5608,III,"In Cornwall, Tristram and Queen Iseult lay;"
5609,III,"In King Marc's chapel, in Tyntagel old--"
5610,III,There in a ship they bore those lovers cold.
5611,III,
5612,III,"The young surviving Iseult, one bright day,"
5613,III,Had wander'd forth. Her children were at play
5614,III,In a green circular hollow in the heath
5615,III,Which borders the sea-shore--a country path
5616,III,Creeps over it from the till'd fields behind.
5617,III,"The hollow's grassy banks are soft-inclined,"
5618,III,"And to one standing on them, far and near"
5619,III,The lone unbroken view spreads bright and clear
5620,III,Over the waste. This cirque of open ground
5621,III,"Is light and green; the heather, which all round"
5622,III,"Creeps thickly, grows not here; but the pale grass"
5623,III,"Is strewn with rocks, and many a shiver'd mass"
5624,III,"Of vein'd white-gleaming quartz, and here and there"
5625,III,Dotted with holly-trees and juniper.
5626,III,In the smooth centre of the opening stood
5627,III,"Three hollies side by side, and made a screen,"
5628,III,"Warm with the winter-sun, of burnish'd green"
5629,III,"With scarlet berries gemm'd, the fell-fare's food."
5630,III,"Under the glittering hollies Iseult stands,"
5631,III,Watching her children play; their little hands
5632,III,"Are busy gathering spars of quartz, and streams"
5633,III,"Of stagshorn for their hats; anon, with screams"
5634,III,"Of mad delight they drop their spoils, and bound"
5635,III,"Among the holly-clumps and broken ground,"
5636,III,"Racing full speed, and startling in their rush"
5637,III,The fell-fares and the speckled missel-thrush
5638,III,Out of their glossy coverts;--but when now
5639,III,"Their cheeks were flush'd, and over each hot brow,"
5640,III,"Under the feather'd hats of the sweet pair,"
5641,III,In blinding masses shower'd the golden hair--
5642,III,"Then Iseult call'd them to her, and the three"
5643,III,"Cluster'd under the holly-screen, and she"
5644,III,Told them an old-world Breton history.
5645,III,
5646,III,"Warm in their mantles wrapt the three stood there,"
5647,III,"Under the hollies, in the clear still air--"
5648,III,Mantles with those rich furs deep glistering
5649,III,Which Venice ships do from swart Egypt bring.
5650,III,"Long they stay'd still--then, pacing at their ease,"
5651,III,Moved up and down under the glossy trees.
5652,III,"But still, as they pursued their warm dry road,"
5653,III,"From Iseult's lips the unbroken story flow'd,"
5654,III,"And still the children listen'd, their blue eyes"
5655,III,Fix'd on their mother's face in wide surprise;
5656,III,"Nor did their looks stray once to the sea-side,"
5657,III,"Nor to the brown heaths round them, bright and wide,"
5658,III,"Nor to the snow, which, though 't was all away"
5659,III,"From the open heath, still by the hedgerows lay,"
5660,III,"Nor to the shining sea-fowl, that with screams"
5661,III,"Bore up from where the bright Atlantic gleams,"
5662,III,"Swooping to landward; nor to where, quite clear,"
5663,III,The fell-fares settled on the thickets near.
5664,III,"And they would still have listen'd, till dark night"
5665,III,Came keen and chill down on the heather bright;
5666,III,"But, when the red glow on the sea grew cold,"
5667,III,And the grey turrets of the castle old
5668,III,"Look'd sternly through the frosty evening-air,"
5669,III,"Then Iseult took by the hand those children fair,"
5670,III,"And brought her tale to an end, and found the path,"
5671,III,And led them home over the darkening heath.
5672,III,
5673,III,And is she happy? Does she see unmoved
5674,III,The days in which she might have lived and loved
5675,III,"Slip without bringing bliss slowly away,"
5676,III,"One after one, to-morrow like to-day?"
5677,III,"Joy has not found her yet, nor ever will--"
5678,III,"Is it this thought which makes her mien so still,"
5679,III,"Her features so fatigued, her eyes, though sweet,"
5680,III,"So sunk, so rarely lifted save to meet"
5681,III,Her children's? She moves slow; her voice alone
5682,III,"Hath yet an infantine and silver tone,"
5683,III,"But even that comes languidly; in truth,"
5684,III,She seems one dying in a mask of youth.
5685,III,"And now she will go home, and softly lay"
5686,III,"Her laughing children in their beds, and play"
5687,III,Awhile with them before they sleep; and then
5688,III,"She'll light her silver lamp, which fishermen"
5689,III,"Dragging their nets through the rough waves, afar,"
5690,III,"Along this iron coast, know like a star,"
5691,III,"And take her broidery-frame, and there she'll sit"
5692,III,"Hour after hour, her gold curls sweeping it;"
5693,III,Lifting her soft-bent head only to mind
5694,III,"Her children, or to listen to the wind."
5695,III,"And when the clock peals midnight, she will move"
5696,III,"Her work away, and let her fingers rove"
5697,III,Across the shaggy brows of Tristram's hound
5698,III,"Who lies, guarding her feet, along the ground;"
5699,III,"Or else she will fall musing, her blue eyes"
5700,III,"Fixt, her slight hands clasp'd on her lap; then rise,"
5701,III,"And at her prie-dieu kneel, until she have told"
5702,III,"Her rosary-beads of ebony tipp'd with gold,"
5703,III,Then to her soft sleep--and to-morrow 'll be
5704,III,To-day's exact repeated effigy.
5705,III,
5706,III,"Yes, it is lonely for her in her hall."
5707,III,"The children, and the grey-hair'd seneschal,"
5708,III,"Her women, and Sir Tristram's aged hound,"
5709,III,Are there the sole companions to be found.
5710,III,But these she loves; and noisier life than this
5711,III,"She would find ill to bear, weak as she is."
5712,III,"She has her children, too, and night and day"
5713,III,"Is with them; and the wide heaths where they play,"
5714,III,"The hollies, and the cliff, and the sea-shore,"
5715,III,"The sand, the sea-birds, and the distant sails,"
5716,III,These are to her dear as to them; the tales
5717,III,With which this day the children she beguiled
5718,III,"She gleaned from Breton grandames, when a child,"
5719,III,In every hut along this sea-coast wild.
5720,III,"She herself loves them still, and, when they are told,"
5721,III,"Can forget all to hear them, as of old."
5722,III,
5723,III,"Dear saints, it is not sorrow, as I hear,"
5724,III,"Not suffering, which shuts up eye and ear"
5725,III,"To all that has delighted them before,"
5726,III,And lets us be what we were once no more.
5727,III,"No, we may suffer deeply, yet retain"
5728,III,"Power to be moved and soothed, for all our pain,"
5729,III,"By what of old pleased us, and will again."
5730,III,"No, 'tis the gradual furnace of the world,"
5731,III,In whose hot air our spirits are upcurl'd
5732,III,"Until they crumble, or else grow like steel--"
5733,III,"Which kills in us the bloom, the youth, the spring--"
5734,III,"Which leaves the fierce necessity to feel,"
5735,III,"But takes away the power--this can avail,"
5736,III,"By drying up our joy in everything,"
5737,III,To make our former pleasures all seem stale.
5738,III,"This, or some tyrannous single thought, some fit"
5739,III,"Of passion, which subdues our souls to it,"
5740,III,Till for its sake alone we live and move--
5741,III,"Call it ambition, or remorse, or love--"
5742,III,"This too can change us wholly, and make seem"
5743,III,"All which we did before, shadow and dream."
5744,III,
5745,III,"And yet, I swear, it angers me to see"
5746,III,How this fool passion gulls men potently;
5747,III,"Being, in truth, but a diseased unrest,"
5748,III,And an unnatural overheat at best.
5749,III,How they are full of languor and distress
5750,III,"Not having it; which when they do possess,"
5751,III,"They straightway are burnt up with fume and care,"
5752,III,And spend their lives in posting here and there
5753,III,"Where this plague drives them; and have little ease,"
5754,III,"Are furious with themselves, and hard to please."
5755,III,"Like that bold Cæsar, the famed Roman wight,"
5756,III,Who wept at reading of a Grecian knight
5757,III,Who made a name at younger years than he;
5758,III,"Or that renown'd mirror of chivalry,"
5759,III,"Prince Alexander, Philip's peerless son,"
5760,III,Who carried the great war from Macedon
5761,III,"Into the Soudan's realm, and thundered on"
5762,III,To die at thirty-five in Babylon.
5763,III,
5764,III,"What tale did Iseult to the children say,"
5765,III,"Under the hollies, that bright winter's day?"
5766,III,
5767,III,She told them of the fairy-haunted land
5768,III,"Away the other side of Brittany,"
5769,III,"Beyond the heaths, edged by the lonely sea;"
5770,III,"Of the deep forest-glades of Broce-liande,"
5771,III,"Through whose green boughs the golden sunshine creeps,"
5772,III,Where Merlin by the enchanted thorn-tree sleeps.
5773,III,"For here he came with the fay Vivian,"
5774,III,"One April, when the warm days first began."
5775,III,"He was on foot, and that false fay, his friend,"
5776,III,"On her white palfrey; here he met his end,"
5777,III,"In these lone sylvan glades, that April-day."
5778,III,This tale of Merlin and the lovely fay
5779,III,"Was the one Iseult chose, and she brought clear"
5780,III,Before the children's fancy him and her.
5781,III,
5782,III,"Blowing between the stems, the forest-air"
5783,III,"Had loosen'd the brown locks of Vivian's hair,"
5784,III,"Which play'd on her flush'd cheek, and her blue eyes"
5785,III,Sparkled with mocking glee and exercise.
5786,III,"Her palfrey's flanks were mired and bathed in sweat,"
5787,III,For they had travell'd far and not stopp'd yet.
5788,III,A brier in that tangled wilderness
5789,III,"Had scored her white right hand, which she allows"
5790,III,To rest ungloved on her green riding-dress;
5791,III,The other warded off the drooping boughs.
5792,III,"But still she chatted on, with her blue eyes"
5793,III,"Fix'd full on Merlin's face, her stately prize."
5794,III,"Her 'haviour had the morning's fresh clear grace,"
5795,III,The spirit of the woods was in her face.
5796,III,"She look'd so witching fair, that learned wight"
5797,III,"Forgot his craft, and his best wits took flight;"
5798,III,"And he grew fond, and eager to obey"
5799,III,"His mistress, use her empire as she may."
5800,III,
5801,III,"They came to where the brushwood ceased, and day"
5802,III,"Peer'd 'twixt the stems; and the ground broke away,"
5803,III,In a sloped sward down to a brawling brook;
5804,III,And up as high as where they stood to look
5805,III,"On the brook's farther side was clear, but then"
5806,III,The underwood and trees began again.
5807,III,This open glen was studded thick with thorns
5808,III,"Then white with blossom; and you saw the horns,"
5809,III,"Through last year's fern, of the shy fallow-deer"
5810,III,Who come at noon down to the water here.
5811,III,You saw the bright-eyed squirrels dart along
5812,III,Under the thorns on the green sward; and strong
5813,III,"The blackbird whistled from the dingles near,"
5814,III,And the weird chipping of the woodpecker
5815,III,"Rang lonelily and sharp; the sky was fair,"
5816,III,And a fresh breath of spring stirr'd everywhere.
5817,III,"Merlin and Vivian stopp'd on the slope's brow,"
5818,III,To gaze on the light sea of leaf and bough
5819,III,"Which glistering plays all round them, lone and mild,"
5820,III,As if to itself the quiet forest smiled.
5821,III,"Upon the brow-top grew a thorn, and here"
5822,III,"The grass was dry and moss'd, and you saw clear"
5823,III,Across the hollow; white anemonies
5824,III,"Starr'd the cool turf, and clumps of primroses"
5825,III,Ran out from the dark underwood behind.
5826,III,No fairer resting-place a man could find.
5827,III,"""Here let us halt,"" said Merlin then; and she"
5828,III,"Nodded, and tied her palfrey to a tree."
5829,III,
5830,III,"They sate them down together, and a sleep"
5831,III,"Fell upon Merlin, more like death, so deep."
5832,III,"Her finger on her lips, then Vivian rose,"
5833,III,"And from her brown-lock'd head the wimple throws,"
5834,III,"And takes it in her hand, and waves it over"
5835,III,The blossom'd thorn-tree and her sleeping lover.
5836,III,"Nine times she waved the fluttering wimple round,"
5837,III,And made a little plot of magic ground.
5838,III,"And in that daised circle, as men say,"
5839,III,Is Merlin prisoner till the judgment-day;
5840,III,But she herself whither she will can rove--
5841,III,For she was passing weary of his love.

8274,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"My friend and I, by chance we talk'd"
8275,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Of Lessing's famed Laocoön;
8276,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,And after we awhile had gone
8277,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"In Lessing's track, and tried to see"
8278,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"What painting is, what poetry--"
8279,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Diverging to another thought,"
8280,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"""Ah,"" cries my friend, ""but who hath taught"
8281,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Why music and the other arts
8282,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Oftener perform aright their parts

8290,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Good poems, if he look'd, more rare"
8291,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,(Though many) than good statues were--
8292,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"For these, in truth, were everywhere."
8293,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Of bards full many a stroke divine
8294,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"In Dante's, Petrarch's, Tasso's line,"
8295,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,The land of Ariosto show'd;
8296,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"And yet, e'en there, the canvas glow'd"
8297,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"With triumphs, a yet ampler brood,"
8298,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Of Raphael and his brotherhood.
8299,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"And nobly perfect, in our day"
8300,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Of haste, half-work, and disarray,"
8301,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Profound yet touching, sweet yet strong,"
8302,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Hath risen Goethe's, Wordsworth's song;"

8306,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Such multitude of heavenly strains

8310,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"While thus my friend discoursed, we pass"
8311,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Out of the path, and take the grass."
8312,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"The grass had still the green of May,"
8313,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,And still the unblacken'd elms were gay;
8314,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"The kine were resting in the shade,"
8315,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,The flies a summer-murmur made.
8316,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Bright was the morn and south the air;
8317,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,The soft-couch'd cattle were as fair
8318,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"As those which pastured by the sea,"
8319,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"That old-world morn, in Sicily,"
8320,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"When on the beach the Cyclops lay,"
8321,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,And Galatea from the bay
8322,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Mock'd her poor lovelorn giant's lay.
8323,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"""Behold,"" I said, ""the painter's sphere!"

8330,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Like these, and in one aspect brought!"
8331,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,In outward semblance he must give
8332,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,A moment's life of things that live;

8335,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,
8336,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Still we walk'd on, in thoughtful mood,"
8337,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,And now upon the bridge we stood.
8338,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Full of sweet breathings was the air,"
8339,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Of sudden stirs and pauses fair.
8340,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Down o'er the stately bridge the breeze
8341,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Came rustling from the garden-trees
8342,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,And on the sparkling waters play'd;
8343,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Light-plashing waves an answer made,"
8344,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,And mimic boats their haven near'd.
8345,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Beyond, the Abbey-towers appear'd,"
8346,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"By mist and chimneys unconfined,"
8347,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Free to the sweep of light and wind;
8348,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,While through their earth-moor'd nave below
8349,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Another breath of wind doth blow,"
8350,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Sound as of wandering breeze--but sound
8351,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,In laws by human artists bound.
8352,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"""The world of music!"" I exclaim'd:--"

8357,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"What power of passion, wealth of change!"
8358,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Some source of feeling he must choose
8359,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"And its lock'd fount of beauty use,"
8360,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,And through the stream of music tell
8361,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Its else unutterable spell;
8362,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"To choose it rightly is his part,"

8369,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,They have declared the spirit's sore
8370,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,"Sore load, and words can do no more."
8371,TO LESSING'S LAOCOÖN,Beethoven takes them then--those two

8761,THE YOUTH OF MAN,"Through the silent, flowery land,"

9042,A SUMMER NIGHT,Doth a whole tract of heaven disclose!
9043,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9044,A SUMMER NIGHT,And to my mind the thought
9045,A SUMMER NIGHT,Is on a sudden brought
9046,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Of a past night, and a far different scene."
9047,A SUMMER NIGHT,Headlands stood out into the moonlit deep
9048,A SUMMER NIGHT,As clearly as at noon;
9049,A SUMMER NIGHT,The spring-tide's brimming flow
9050,A SUMMER NIGHT,Heaved dazzlingly between;
9051,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Houses, with long white sweep,"
9052,A SUMMER NIGHT,Girdled the glistening bay;
9053,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Behind, through the soft air,"
9054,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The blue haze-cradled mountains spread away,"
9055,A SUMMER NIGHT,The night was far more fair--
9056,A SUMMER NIGHT,"But the same restless pacings to and fro,"
9057,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And the same vainly throbbing heart was there,"
9058,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And the same bright, calm moon."
9059,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9060,A SUMMER NIGHT,And the calm moonlight seems to say:
9061,A SUMMER NIGHT,"_Hast thou then still the old unquiet breast,_"
9062,A SUMMER NIGHT,"_Which neither deadens into rest,_"
9063,A SUMMER NIGHT,_Nor ever feels the fiery glow_
9064,A SUMMER NIGHT,"_That whirls the spirit from itself away,_"
9065,A SUMMER NIGHT,"_But fluctuates to and fro,_"
9066,A SUMMER NIGHT,_Never by passion quite possess'd_
9067,A SUMMER NIGHT,_And never quite benumb'd by the world's sway?_--
9068,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And I, I know not if to pray"
9069,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Still to be what I am, or yield and be"
9070,A SUMMER NIGHT,Like all the other men I see.
9071,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9072,A SUMMER NIGHT,"For most men in a brazen prison live,"
9073,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Where, in the sun's hot eye,"
9074,A SUMMER NIGHT,"With heads bent o'er their toil, they languidly"
9075,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Their lives to some unmeaning taskwork give,"
9076,A SUMMER NIGHT,Dreaming of nought beyond their prison-wall.
9077,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And as, year after year,"
9078,A SUMMER NIGHT,Fresh products of their barren labour fall
9079,A SUMMER NIGHT,"From their tired hands, and rest"
9080,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Never yet comes more near,"
9081,A SUMMER NIGHT,Gloom settles slowly down over their breast;
9082,A SUMMER NIGHT,And while they try to stem
9083,A SUMMER NIGHT,"The waves of mournful thought by which they are prest,"
9084,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Death in their prison reaches them,"
9085,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Unfreed, having seen nothing, still unblest."
9086,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9087,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And the rest, a few,"
9088,A SUMMER NIGHT,Escape their prison and depart
9089,A SUMMER NIGHT,On the wide ocean of life anew.
9090,A SUMMER NIGHT,"There the freed prisoner, where'er his heart"
9091,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Listeth, will sail;"
9092,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Nor doth he know how there prevail,"
9093,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Despotic on that sea,"
9094,A SUMMER NIGHT,Trade-winds which cross it from eternity.
9095,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Awhile he holds some false way, undebarr'd"
9096,A SUMMER NIGHT,"By thwarting signs, and braves"
9097,A SUMMER NIGHT,The freshening wind and blackening waves.
9098,A SUMMER NIGHT,And then the tempest strikes him; and between
9099,A SUMMER NIGHT,The lightning-bursts is seen
9100,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Only a driving wreck,"
9101,A SUMMER NIGHT,And the pale master on his spar-strewn deck
9102,A SUMMER NIGHT,With anguish'd face and flying hair
9103,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Grasping the rudder hard,"
9104,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Still bent to make some port he knows not where,"
9105,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Still standing for some false, impossible shore."
9106,A SUMMER NIGHT,And sterner comes the roar
9107,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Of sea and wind, and through the deepening gloom"
9108,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Fainter and fainter wreck and helmsman loom,"
9109,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And he too disappears, and comes no more."
9110,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9111,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Is there no life, but these alone?"
9112,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Madman or slave, must man be one?"
9113,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9114,A SUMMER NIGHT,Plainness and clearness without shadow of stain!
9115,A SUMMER NIGHT,Clearness divine!
9116,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Ye heavens, whose pure dark regions have no sign"
9117,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Of languor, though so calm, and, though so great,"
9118,A SUMMER NIGHT,Are yet untroubled and unpassionate;
9119,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Who, though so noble, share in the world's toil,"
9120,A SUMMER NIGHT,"And, though so task'd, keep free from dust and soil!"
9121,A SUMMER NIGHT,I will not say that your mild deeps retain
9122,A SUMMER NIGHT,"A tinge, it may be, of their silent pain"
9123,A SUMMER NIGHT,"Who have long'd deeply once, and long'd in vain--"
9124,A SUMMER NIGHT,But I will rather say that you remain
9125,A SUMMER NIGHT,"A world above man's head, to let him see"
9126,A SUMMER NIGHT,"How boundless might his soul's horizons be,"
9127,A SUMMER NIGHT,"How vast, yet of what clear transparency!"
9128,A SUMMER NIGHT,"How it were good to abide there, and breathe free;"
9129,A SUMMER NIGHT,How fair a lot to fill
9130,A SUMMER NIGHT,Is left to each man still!
9131,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9132,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9133,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9134,A SUMMER NIGHT,
9135,THE BURIED LIFE,THE BURIED LIFE
9136,THE BURIED LIFE,
9137,THE BURIED LIFE,
9138,THE BURIED LIFE,"Light flows our war of mocking words, and yet,"
9139,THE BURIED LIFE,"Behold, with tears mine eyes are wet!"
9140,THE BURIED LIFE,I feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll.
9141,THE BURIED LIFE,"Yes, yes, we know that we can jest,"
9142,THE BURIED LIFE,"We know, we know that we can smile!"
9143,THE BURIED LIFE,"But there's a something in this breast,"
9144,THE BURIED LIFE,"To which thy light words bring no rest,"
9145,THE BURIED LIFE,And thy gay smiles no anodyne.
9146,THE BURIED LIFE,"Give me thy hand, and hush awhile,"
9147,THE BURIED LIFE,"And turn those limpid eyes on mine,"
9148,THE BURIED LIFE,"And let me read there, love! thy inmost soul."
9149,THE BURIED LIFE,
9150,THE BURIED LIFE,Alas! is even love too weak
9151,THE BURIED LIFE,"To unlock the heart, and let it speak?"
9152,THE BURIED LIFE,Are even lovers powerless to reveal
9153,THE BURIED LIFE,To one another what indeed they feel?
9154,THE BURIED LIFE,I knew the mass of men conceal'd
9155,THE BURIED LIFE,"Their thoughts, for fear that if reveal'd"
9156,THE BURIED LIFE,They would by other men be met
9157,THE BURIED LIFE,"With blank indifference, or with blame reproved;"
9158,THE BURIED LIFE,I knew they lived and moved
9159,THE BURIED LIFE,"Trick'd in disguises, alien to the rest"
9160,THE BURIED LIFE,"Of men, and alien to themselves--and yet"
9161,THE BURIED LIFE,The same heart beats in every human breast!
9162,THE BURIED LIFE,
9163,THE BURIED LIFE,"But we, my love!--doth a like spell benumb"
9164,THE BURIED LIFE,"Our hearts, our voices?--must we too be dumb?"
9165,THE BURIED LIFE,
9166,THE BURIED LIFE,"Ah! well for us, if even we,"
9167,THE BURIED LIFE,"Even for a moment, can get free"
9168,THE BURIED LIFE,"Our heart, and have our lips unchain'd;"
9169,THE BURIED LIFE,For that which seals them hath been deep-ordain'd!
9170,THE BURIED LIFE,
9171,THE BURIED LIFE,"Fate, which foresaw"
9172,THE BURIED LIFE,How frivolous a baby man would be----
9173,THE BURIED LIFE,"By what distractions he would be possess'd,"
9174,THE BURIED LIFE,"How he would pour himself in every strife,"
9175,THE BURIED LIFE,And well-nigh change his own identity----
9176,THE BURIED LIFE,That it might keep from his capricious play
9177,THE BURIED LIFE,"His genuine self, and force him to obey"
9178,THE BURIED LIFE,"Even in his own despite his being's law,"
9179,THE BURIED LIFE,Bade through the deep recesses of our breast
9180,THE BURIED LIFE,The unregarded river of our life
9181,THE BURIED LIFE,Pursue with indiscernible flow its way;
9182,THE BURIED LIFE,And that we should not see
9183,THE BURIED LIFE,"The buried stream, and seem to be"
9184,THE BURIED LIFE,"Eddying at large in blind uncertainty,"
9185,THE BURIED LIFE,Though driving on with it eternally.
9186,THE BURIED LIFE,
9187,THE BURIED LIFE,"But often, in the world's most crowded streets,"
9188,THE BURIED LIFE,"But often, in the din of strife,"
9189,THE BURIED LIFE,There rises an unspeakable desire
9190,THE BURIED LIFE,After the knowledge of our buried life;
9191,THE BURIED LIFE,A thirst to spend our fire and restless force
9192,THE BURIED LIFE,"In tracking out our true, original course;"
9193,THE BURIED LIFE,A longing to inquire
9194,THE BURIED LIFE,Into the mystery of this heart which beats
9195,THE BURIED LIFE,"So wild, so deep in us--to know"
9196,THE BURIED LIFE,Whence our lives come and where they go.
9197,THE BURIED LIFE,"And many a man in his own breast then delves,"
9198,THE BURIED LIFE,"But deep enough, alas! none ever mines."
9199,THE BURIED LIFE,"And we have been on many thousand lines,"
9200,THE BURIED LIFE,"And we have shown, on each, spirit and power;"
9201,THE BURIED LIFE,"But hardly have we, for one little hour,"
9202,THE BURIED LIFE,"Been on our own line, have we been ourselves--"
9203,THE BURIED LIFE,Hardly had skill to utter one of all
9204,THE BURIED LIFE,"The nameless feelings that course through our breast,"
9205,THE BURIED LIFE,But they course on for ever unexpress'd.
9206,THE BURIED LIFE,And long we try in vain to speak and act
9207,THE BURIED LIFE,"Our hidden self, and what we say and do"
9208,THE BURIED LIFE,"Is eloquent, is well--but 'tis not true!"
9209,THE BURIED LIFE,And then we will no more be rack'd
9210,THE BURIED LIFE,"With inward striving, and demand"
9211,THE BURIED LIFE,Of all the thousand nothings of the hour
9212,THE BURIED LIFE,Their stupefying power;
9213,THE BURIED LIFE,"Ah yes, and they benumb us at our call!"
9214,THE BURIED LIFE,"Yet still, from time to time, vague and forlorn,"
9215,THE BURIED LIFE,From the soul's subterranean depth upborne
9216,THE BURIED LIFE,"As from an infinitely distant land,"
9217,THE BURIED LIFE,"Come airs, and floating echoes, and convey"
9218,THE BURIED LIFE,A melancholy into all our day.
9219,THE BURIED LIFE,
9220,THE BURIED LIFE,Only--but this is rare--
9221,THE BURIED LIFE,"When a belovéd hand is laid in ours,"
9222,THE BURIED LIFE,"When, jaded with the rush and glare"
9223,THE BURIED LIFE,"Of the interminable hours,"
9224,THE BURIED LIFE,"Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear,"
9225,THE BURIED LIFE,When our world-deafen'd ear
9226,THE BURIED LIFE,Is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd--
9227,THE BURIED LIFE,"A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast,"
9228,THE BURIED LIFE,And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again.
9229,THE BURIED LIFE,"The eye sinks inward, and the heart lies plain,"
9230,THE BURIED LIFE,"And what we mean, we say, and what we would, we know."
9231,THE BURIED LIFE,"A man becomes aware of his life's flow,"
9232,THE BURIED LIFE,And hears its winding murmur; and he sees
9233,THE BURIED LIFE,"The meadows where it glides, the sun, the breeze."
9234,THE BURIED LIFE,
9235,THE BURIED LIFE,And there arrives a lull in the hot race
9236,THE BURIED LIFE,Wherein he doth for ever chase
9237,THE BURIED LIFE,"That flying and elusive shadow, rest."
9238,THE BURIED LIFE,"An air of coolness plays upon his face,"
9239,THE BURIED LIFE,And an unwonted calm pervades his breast.
9240,THE BURIED LIFE,And then he thinks he knows
9241,THE BURIED LIFE,"The hills where his life rose,"
9242,THE BURIED LIFE,And the sea where it goes.

9261,WRITTEN IN KENSINGTON GARDENS,
9262,WRITTEN IN KENSINGTON GARDENS,Sometimes a child will cross the glade

9387,THE FUTURE,Brimming with wonder and joy
9388,THE FUTURE,"He spreads out his arms to the light,"
9389,THE FUTURE,Rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream.
9390,THE FUTURE,
9391,THE FUTURE,"As what he sees is, so have his thoughts been."

9394,THE FUTURE,"Echoing the screams of the eagles,"
9395,THE FUTURE,Hems in its gorges the bed
9396,THE FUTURE,Of the new-born clear-flowing stream;
9397,THE FUTURE,Whether he first sees light
9398,THE FUTURE,Where the river in gleaming rings
9399,THE FUTURE,Sluggishly winds through the plain;
9400,THE FUTURE,Whether in sound of the swallowing sea--
9401,THE FUTURE,"As is the world on the banks,"

9409,THE FUTURE,Only the tract where he sails
9410,THE FUTURE,"He wots of; only the thoughts,"

9426,THE FUTURE,"As deep, as pellucid a spring"
9427,THE FUTURE,"Of feeling, as tranquil, as sure?"

9429,THE FUTURE,"What bard,"

9439,THE FUTURE,This tract which the river of Time
9440,THE FUTURE,"Now flows through with us, is the plain."
9441,THE FUTURE,Gone is the calm of its earlier shore.
9442,THE FUTURE,Border'd by cities and hoarse
9443,THE FUTURE,With a thousand cries is its stream.
9444,THE FUTURE,"And we on its breast, our minds"
9445,THE FUTURE,"Are confused as the cries which we hear,"
9446,THE FUTURE,Changing and shot as the sights which we see.
9447,THE FUTURE,
9448,THE FUTURE,And we say that repose has fled
9449,THE FUTURE,For ever the course of the river of Time.
9450,THE FUTURE,That cities will crowd to its edge
9451,THE FUTURE,"In a blacker, incessanter line;"
9452,THE FUTURE,"That the din will be more on its banks,"
9453,THE FUTURE,"Denser the trade on its stream,"
9454,THE FUTURE,"Flatter the plain where it flows,"
9455,THE FUTURE,Fiercer the sun overhead.
9456,THE FUTURE,That never will those on its breast
9457,THE FUTURE,"See an ennobling sight,"
9458,THE FUTURE,Drink of the feeling of quiet again.
9459,THE FUTURE,
9460,THE FUTURE,"But what was before us we know not,"
9461,THE FUTURE,And we know not what shall succeed.
9462,THE FUTURE,
9463,THE FUTURE,"Haply, the river of Time--"
9464,THE FUTURE,"As it grows, as the towns on its marge"
9465,THE FUTURE,Fling their wavering lights
9466,THE FUTURE,"On a wider, statelier stream--"
9467,THE FUTURE,"May acquire, if not the calm"
9468,THE FUTURE,"Of its early mountainous shore,"
9469,THE FUTURE,Yet a solemn peace of its own.
9470,THE FUTURE,
9471,THE FUTURE,"And the width of the waters, the hush"
9472,THE FUTURE,"Of the grey expanse where he floats,"
9473,THE FUTURE,Freshening its current and spotted with foam
9474,THE FUTURE,"As it draws to the Ocean, may strike"
9475,THE FUTURE,Peace to the soul of the man on its breast--
9476,THE FUTURE,"As the pale waste widens around him,"
9477,THE FUTURE,"As the banks fade dimmer away,"
9478,THE FUTURE,"As the stars come out, and the night-wind"
9479,THE FUTURE,Brings up the stream
9480,THE FUTURE,Murmurs and scents of the infinite sea.

9491,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9492,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9493,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Go, for they call you, shepherd, from the hill;"
9494,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Go, shepherd, and untie the wattled cotes!"
9495,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"No longer leave thy wistful flock unfed,"
9496,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Nor let thy bawling fellows rack their throats,"
9497,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Nor the cropp'd herbage shoot another head.
9498,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"But when the fields are still,"
9499,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And the tired men and dogs all gone to rest,"
9500,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And only the white sheep are sometimes seen
9501,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Cross and recross the strips of moon-blanch'd green,"
9502,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Come, shepherd, and again begin the quest!"
9503,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9504,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Here, where the reaper was at work of late--"
9505,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"In this high field's dark corner, where he leaves"
9506,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"His coat, his basket, and his earthen cruse,"
9507,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And in the sun all morning binds the sheaves,"
9508,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Then here, at noon, comes back his stores to use--"
9509,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Here will I sit and wait,"
9510,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],While to my ear from uplands far away
9511,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"The bleating of the folded flocks is borne,"
9512,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],With distant cries of reapers in the corn--
9513,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],All the live murmur of a summer's day.
9514,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9515,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Screen'd is this nook o'er the high, half-reap'd field,"
9516,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And here till sun-down, shepherd! will I be."
9517,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Through the thick corn the scarlet poppies peep,"
9518,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And round green roots and yellowing stalks I see
9519,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Pale pink convolvulus in tendrils creep;
9520,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And air-swept lindens yield
9521,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Their scent, and rustle down their perfumed showers"
9522,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Of bloom on the bent grass where I am laid,"
9523,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And bower me from the August sun with shade;
9524,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And the eye travels down to Oxford's towers.
9525,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9526,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And near me on the grass lies Glanvil's book--
9527,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Come, let me read the oft-read tale again!"
9528,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"The story of the Oxford scholar poor,"
9529,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Of pregnant parts and quick inventive brain,"
9530,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Who, tired of knocking at preferment's door,"
9531,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],One summer-morn forsook
9532,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"His friends, and went to learn the gipsy-lore,"
9533,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And roam'd the world with that wild brotherhood,"
9534,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And came, as most men deem'd, to little good,"
9535,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],But came to Oxford and his friends no more.
9536,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9537,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"But once, years after, in the country-lanes,"
9538,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Two scholars, whom at college erst he knew,"
9539,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Met him, and of his way of life enquired;"
9540,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Whereat he answer'd, that the gipsy-crew,"
9541,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"His mates, had arts to rule as they desired"
9542,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"The workings of men's brains,"
9543,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And they can bind them to what thoughts they will.
9544,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"""And I,"" he said, ""the secret of their art,"
9545,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"When fully learn'd, will to the world impart;"
9546,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"But it needs heaven-sent moments for this skill."""
9547,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9548,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"This said, he left them, and return'd no more.--"
9549,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"But rumours hung about the country-side,"
9550,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"That the lost Scholar long was seen to stray,"
9551,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Seen by rare glimpses, pensive and tongue-tied,"
9552,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"In hat of antique shape, and cloak of grey,"
9553,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],The same the gipsies wore.
9554,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Shepherds had met him on the Hurst in spring;
9555,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"At some lone alehouse in the Berkshire moors,"
9556,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"On the warm ingle-bench, the smock-frock'd boors"
9557,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Had found him seated at their entering,"
9558,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9559,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"But, 'mid their drink and clatter, he would fly."
9560,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And I myself seem half to know thy looks,"
9561,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And put the shepherds, wanderer! on thy trace;"
9562,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And boys who in lone wheatfields scare the rooks
9563,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],I ask if thou hast pass'd their quiet place;
9564,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Or in my boat I lie
9565,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Moor'd to the cool bank in the summer-heats,"
9566,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"'Mid wide grass meadows which the sunshine fills,"
9567,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And watch the warm, green-muffled Cumner hills,"
9568,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And wonder if thou haunt'st their shy retreats.
9569,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9570,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"For most, I know, thou lov'st retired ground!"
9571,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Thee at the ferry Oxford riders blithe,"
9572,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Returning home on summer-nights, have met"
9573,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Crossing the stripling Thames at Bab-lock-hithe,"
9574,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Trailing in the cool stream thy fingers wet,"
9575,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],As the punt's rope chops round;
9576,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And leaning backward in a pensive dream,"
9577,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And fostering in thy lap a heap of flowers
9578,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Pluck'd in shy fields and distant Wychwood bowers,"
9579,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And thine eyes resting on the moonlit stream.
9580,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9581,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And then they land, and thou art seen no more!--"
9582,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Maidens, who from the distant hamlets come"
9583,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"To dance around the Fyfield elm in May,"
9584,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Oft through the darkening fields have seen thee roam,"
9585,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Or cross a stile into the public way.
9586,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Oft thou hast given them store
9587,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Of flowers--the frail-leaf'd, white anemony,"
9588,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Dark bluebells drench'd with dews of summer eves,"
9589,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And purple orchises with spotted leaves--
9590,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],But none hath words she can report of thee.
9591,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9592,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And, above Godstow Bridge, when hay-time's here"
9593,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"In June, and many a scythe in sunshine flames,"
9594,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Men who through those wide fields of breezy grass
9595,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Where black-wing'd swallows haunt the glittering Thames,"
9596,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"To bathe in the abandon'd lasher pass,"
9597,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Have often pass'd thee near
9598,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Sitting upon the river bank o'ergrown;
9599,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Mark'd thine outlandish garb, thy figure spare,"
9600,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Thy dark vague eyes, and soft abstracted air--"
9601,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"But, when they came from bathing, thou wast gone!"
9602,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9603,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"At some lone homestead in the Cumner hills,"
9604,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Where at her open door the housewife darns,"
9605,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Thou hast been seen, or hanging on a gate"
9606,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],To watch the threshers in the mossy barns.
9607,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Children, who early range these slopes and late"
9608,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"For cresses from the rills,"
9609,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Have known thee eying, all an April-day,"
9610,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],The springing pastures and the feeding kine;
9611,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And mark'd thee, when the stars come out and shine,"
9612,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Through the long dewy grass move slow away.
9613,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9614,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"In autumn, on the skirts of Bagley Wood--"
9615,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Where most the gipsies by the turf-edged way
9616,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Pitch their smoked tents, and every bush you see"
9617,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"With scarlet patches tagg'd and shreds of grey,"
9618,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Above the forest-ground called Thessaly--
9619,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"The blackbird, picking food,"
9620,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Sees thee, nor stops his meal, nor fears at all;"
9621,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"So often has he known thee past him stray,"
9622,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Rapt, twirling in thy hand a wither'd spray,"
9623,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And waiting for the spark from heaven to fall.
9624,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9625,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And once, in winter, on the causeway chill"
9626,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Where home through flooded fields foot-travellers go,"
9627,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Have I not pass'd thee on the wooden bridge,"
9628,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Wrapt in thy cloak and battling with the snow,"
9629,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Thy face tow'rd Hinksey and its wintry ridge?
9630,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And thou hast climb'd the hill,"
9631,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And gain'd the white brow of the Cumner range;
9632,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Turn'd once to watch, while thick the snowflakes fall,"
9633,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],The line of festal light in Christ-Church hall--
9634,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Then sought thy straw in some sequester'd grange.
9635,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9636,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],But what--I dream! Two hundred years are flown
9637,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Since first thy story ran through Oxford halls,"
9638,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And the grave Glanvil did the tale inscribe
9639,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],That thou wert wander'd from the studious walls
9640,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"To learn strange arts, and join a gipsy-tribe;"
9641,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And thou from earth art gone
9642,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Long since, and in some quiet churchyard laid--"
9643,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Some country-nook, where o'er thy unknown grave"
9644,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Tall grasses and white flowering nettles wave,"
9645,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Under a dark, red-fruited yew-tree's shade."
9646,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9647,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"--No, no, thou hast not felt the lapse of hours!"
9648,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],For what wears out the life of mortal men?
9649,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],'Tis that from change to change their being rolls;
9650,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"'Tis that repeated shocks, again, again,"
9651,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Exhaust the energy of strongest souls
9652,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And numb the elastic powers.
9653,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Till having used our nerves with bliss and teen,"
9654,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And tired upon a thousand schemes our wit,"
9655,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],To the just-pausing Genius we remit
9656,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Our worn-out life, and are--what we have been."
9657,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9658,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Thou hast not lived, why should'st thou perish, so?"
9659,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Thou hadst _one_ aim, _one_ business, _one_ desire;"
9660,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Else wert thou long since number'd with the dead!
9661,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Else hadst thou spent, like other men, thy fire!"
9662,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"The generations of thy peers are fled,"
9663,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And we ourselves shall go;
9664,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"But thou possessest an immortal lot,"
9665,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And we imagine thee exempt from age
9666,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And living as thou liv'st on Glanvil's page,"
9667,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Because thou hadst--what we, alas! have not."
9668,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9669,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"For early didst thou leave the world, with powers"
9670,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Fresh, undiverted to the world without,"
9671,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Firm to their mark, not spent on other things;"
9672,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt,"
9673,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Which much to have tried, in much been baffled, brings."
9674,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],O life unlike to ours!
9675,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Who fluctuate idly without term or scope,"
9676,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Of whom each strives, nor knows for what he strives,"
9677,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And each half lives a hundred different lives;
9678,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Who wait like thee, but not, like thee, in hope."
9679,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9680,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Thou waitest for the spark from heaven! and we,"
9681,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Light half-believers of our casual creeds,"
9682,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Who never deeply felt, nor clearly will'd,"
9683,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Whose insight never has borne fruit in deeds,"
9684,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Whose vague resolves never have been fulfill'd;
9685,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],For whom each year we see
9686,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Breeds new beginnings, disappointments new;"
9687,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Who hesitate and falter life away,"
9688,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And lose to-morrow the ground won to-day--
9689,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Ah! do not we, wanderer! await it too?"
9690,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9691,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Yes, we await it!--but it still delays,"
9692,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And then we suffer! and amongst us one,"
9693,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Who most has suffer'd, takes dejectedly"
9694,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],His seat upon the intellectual throne;
9695,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And all his store of sad experience he
9696,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Lays bare of wretched days;
9697,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Tells us his misery's birth and growth and signs,"
9698,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And how the dying spark of hope was fed,"
9699,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And how the breast was soothed, and how the head,"
9700,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And all his hourly varied anodynes.
9701,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9702,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"This for our wisest! and we others pine,"
9703,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And wish the long unhappy dream would end,"
9704,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And waive all claim to bliss, and try to bear;"
9705,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"With close-lipp'd patience for our only friend,"
9706,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Sad patience, too near neighbour to despair--"
9707,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],But none has hope like thine!
9708,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Thou through the fields and through the woods dost stray,"
9709,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Roaming the country-side, a truant boy,"
9710,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Nursing thy project in unclouded joy,"
9711,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And every doubt long blown by time away.
9712,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9713,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"O born in days when wits were fresh and clear,"
9714,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And life ran gaily as the sparkling Thames;
9715,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Before this strange disease of modern life,"
9716,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"With its sick hurry, its divided aims,"
9717,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Its heads o'ertax'd, its palsied hearts, was rife--"
9718,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Fly hence, our contact fear!"
9719,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Still fly, plunge deeper in the bowering wood!"
9720,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Averse, as Dido did with gesture stern"
9721,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"From her false friend's approach in Hades turn,"
9722,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Wave us away, and keep thy solitude!"
9723,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9724,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Still nursing the unconquerable hope,"
9725,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Still clutching the inviolable shade,"
9726,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"With a free, onward impulse brushing through,"
9727,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"By night, the silver'd branches of the glade--"
9728,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Far on the forest-skirts, where none pursue,"
9729,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],On some mild pastoral slope
9730,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Emerge, and resting on the moonlit pales"
9731,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Freshen thy flowers as in former years
9732,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"With dew, or listen with enchanted ears,"
9733,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"From the dark dingles, to the nightingales!"
9734,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9735,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"But fly our paths, our feverish contact fly!"
9736,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"For strong the infection of our mental strife,"
9737,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Which, though it gives no bliss, yet spoils for rest;"
9738,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And we should win thee from thy own fair life,"
9739,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Like us distracted, and like us unblest."
9740,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Soon, soon thy cheer would die,"
9741,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Thy hopes grow timorous, and unfix'd thy powers,"
9742,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],And thy clear aims be cross and shifting made;
9743,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And then thy glad perennial youth would fade,"
9744,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Fade, and grow old at last, and die like ours."
9745,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],
9746,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Then fly our greetings, fly our speech and smiles!"
9747,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"--As some grave Tyrian trader, from the sea,"
9748,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Descried at sunrise an emerging prow
9749,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"Lifting the cool-hair'd creepers stealthily,"
9750,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],The fringes of a southward-facing brow
9751,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],Among the Ægæan isles;
9752,THE SCHOLAR-GIPSY[16],"And saw the merry Grecian coaster come,"

9774,THYRSIS[17],"ARTHUR HUGH CLOUGH, _who died at Florence_, 1861."
9775,THYRSIS[17],
9776,THYRSIS[17],
9777,THYRSIS[17],How changed is here each spot man makes or fills!
9778,THYRSIS[17],In the two Hinkseys nothing keeps the same;
9779,THYRSIS[17],"The village street its haunted mansion lacks,"
9780,THYRSIS[17],"And from the sign is gone Sibylla's name,"
9781,THYRSIS[17],And from the roofs the twisted chimney-stacks--
9782,THYRSIS[17],"Are ye too changed, ye hills?"
9783,THYRSIS[17],"See, 'tis no foot of unfamiliar men"
9784,THYRSIS[17],To-night from Oxford up your pathway strays!
9785,THYRSIS[17],"Here came I often, often, in old days----"
9786,THYRSIS[17],Thyrsis and I; we still had Thyrsis then.
9787,THYRSIS[17],
9788,THYRSIS[17],"Runs it not here, the track by Childsworth Farm,"
9789,THYRSIS[17],"Past the high wood, to where the elm-tree crowns"
9790,THYRSIS[17],The hill behind whose ridge the sunset flames?
9791,THYRSIS[17],"The signal-elm, that looks on Ilsley Downs,"
9792,THYRSIS[17],"The Vale, the three lone weirs, the youthful Thames?--"
9793,THYRSIS[17],"This winter-eve is warm,"
9794,THYRSIS[17],"Humid the air! leafless, yet soft as spring,"
9795,THYRSIS[17],The tender purple spray on copse and briers!
9796,THYRSIS[17],"And that sweet city with her dreaming spires,"
9797,THYRSIS[17],"She needs not June for beauty's heightening,"
9798,THYRSIS[17],
9799,THYRSIS[17],"Lovely all times she lies, lovely to-night!--"
9800,THYRSIS[17],"Only, methinks, some loss of habit's power"
9801,THYRSIS[17],Befalls me wandering through this upland dim.
9802,THYRSIS[17],"Once pass'd I blindfold here, at any hour;"
9803,THYRSIS[17],"Now seldom come I, since I came with him."
9804,THYRSIS[17],That single elm-tree bright
9805,THYRSIS[17],Against the west--I miss it! is it gone?
9806,THYRSIS[17],"We prized it dearly; while it stood, we said,"
9807,THYRSIS[17],"Our friend, the Gipsy-Scholar, was not dead;"
9808,THYRSIS[17],"While the tree lived, he in these fields lived on."
9809,THYRSIS[17],
9810,THYRSIS[17],"Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here,"
9811,THYRSIS[17],"But once I knew each field, each flower, each stick;"
9812,THYRSIS[17],And with the country-folk acquaintance made
9813,THYRSIS[17],"By barn in threshing-time, by new-built rick."
9814,THYRSIS[17],"Here, too, our shepherd-pipes we first assay'd."
9815,THYRSIS[17],Ah me! this many a year
9816,THYRSIS[17],"My pipe is lost, my shepherd's holiday!"
9817,THYRSIS[17],"Needs must I lose them, needs with heavy heart"
9818,THYRSIS[17],Into the world and wave of men depart;
9819,THYRSIS[17],But Thyrsis of his own will went away.
9820,THYRSIS[17],
9821,THYRSIS[17],"It irk'd him to be here, he could not rest."
9822,THYRSIS[17],"He loved each simple joy the country yields,"
9823,THYRSIS[17],"He loved his mates; but yet he could not keep,"
9824,THYRSIS[17],"For that a shadow lour'd on the fields,"
9825,THYRSIS[17],Here with the shepherds and the silly sheep.
9826,THYRSIS[17],Some life of men unblest
9827,THYRSIS[17],"He knew, which made him droop, and fill'd his head."
9828,THYRSIS[17],He went; his piping took a troubled sound
9829,THYRSIS[17],Of storms that rage outside our happy ground;
9830,THYRSIS[17],"He could not wait their passing, he is dead."
9831,THYRSIS[17],
9832,THYRSIS[17],"So, some tempestuous morn in early June,"
9833,THYRSIS[17],"When the year's primal burst of bloom is o'er,"
9834,THYRSIS[17],Before the roses and the longest day--
9835,THYRSIS[17],When garden-walks and all the grassy floor
9836,THYRSIS[17],With blossoms red and white of fallen May
9837,THYRSIS[17],And chestnut-flowers are strewn--
9838,THYRSIS[17],"So have I heard the cuckoo's parting cry,"
9839,THYRSIS[17],"From the wet field, through the vext garden-trees,"
9840,THYRSIS[17],Come with the volleying rain and tossing breeze:
9841,THYRSIS[17],"_The bloom is gone, and with the bloom go I!_"
9842,THYRSIS[17],
9843,THYRSIS[17],"Too quick despairer, wherefore wilt thou go?"
9844,THYRSIS[17],"Soon will the high Midsummer pomps come on,"
9845,THYRSIS[17],"Soon will the musk carnations break and swell,"
9846,THYRSIS[17],"Soon shall we have gold-dusted snapdragon,"
9847,THYRSIS[17],"Sweet-William with his homely cottage-smell,"
9848,THYRSIS[17],And stocks in fragrant blow;
9849,THYRSIS[17],"Roses that down the alleys shine afar,"
9850,THYRSIS[17],"And open, jasmine-muffled lattices,"
9851,THYRSIS[17],"And groups under the dreaming garden-trees,"
9852,THYRSIS[17],"And the full moon, and the white evening-star."
9853,THYRSIS[17],
9854,THYRSIS[17],"He hearkens not! light comer, he is flown!"
9855,THYRSIS[17],"What matters it? next year he will return,"
9856,THYRSIS[17],"And we shall have him in the sweet spring-days,"
9857,THYRSIS[17],"With whitening hedges, and uncrumpling fern,"
9858,THYRSIS[17],"And blue-bells trembling by the forest-ways,"
9859,THYRSIS[17],And scent of hay new-mown.
9860,THYRSIS[17],But Thyrsis never more we swains shall see;
9861,THYRSIS[17],"See him come back, and cut a smoother reed,"
9862,THYRSIS[17],And blow a strain the world at last shall heed--
9863,THYRSIS[17],"For Time, not Corydon, hath conquer'd thee!"
9864,THYRSIS[17],
9865,THYRSIS[17],"Alack, for Corydon no rival now!--"
9866,THYRSIS[17],"But when Sicilian shepherds lost a mate,"
9867,THYRSIS[17],"Some good survivor with his flute would go,"
9868,THYRSIS[17],Piping a ditty sad for Bion's fate;
9869,THYRSIS[17],"And cross the unpermitted ferry's flow,"
9870,THYRSIS[17],"And relax Pluto's brow,"
9871,THYRSIS[17],And make leap up with joy the beauteous head
9872,THYRSIS[17],"Of Proserpine, among whose crowned hair"
9873,THYRSIS[17],"Are flowers first open'd on Sicilian air,"
9874,THYRSIS[17],"And flute his friend, like Orpheus, from the dead."
9875,THYRSIS[17],
9876,THYRSIS[17],O easy access to the hearer's grace
9877,THYRSIS[17],When Dorian shepherds sang to Proserpine!
9878,THYRSIS[17],"For she herself had trod Sicilian fields,"
9879,THYRSIS[17],"She knew the Dorian water's gush divine,"
9880,THYRSIS[17],"She knew each lily white which Enna yields,"
9881,THYRSIS[17],Each rose with blushing face;
9882,THYRSIS[17],"She loved the Dorian pipe, the Dorian strain."
9883,THYRSIS[17],"But ah, of our poor Thames she never heard!"
9884,THYRSIS[17],Her foot the Cumner cowslips never stirr'd;
9885,THYRSIS[17],And we should tease her with our plaint in vain!
9886,THYRSIS[17],
9887,THYRSIS[17],"Well! wind-dispersed and vain the words will be,"
9888,THYRSIS[17],"Yet, Thyrsis, let me give my grief its hour"
9889,THYRSIS[17],"In the old haunt, and find our tree-topp'd hill!"
9890,THYRSIS[17],"Who, if not I, for questing here hath power?"
9891,THYRSIS[17],"I know the wood which hides the daffodil,"
9892,THYRSIS[17],"I know the Fyfield tree,"
9893,THYRSIS[17],"I know what white, what purple fritillaries"
9894,THYRSIS[17],"The grassy harvest of the river-fields,"
9895,THYRSIS[17],"Above by Ensham, down by Sandford, yields,"
9896,THYRSIS[17],And what sedged brooks are Thames's tributaries;
9897,THYRSIS[17],
9898,THYRSIS[17],I know these slopes; who knows them if not I?--
9899,THYRSIS[17],"But many a dingle on the loved hill-side,"
9900,THYRSIS[17],"With thorns once studded, old, white-blossom'd trees,"
9901,THYRSIS[17],"Where thick the cowslips grew, and far descried"
9902,THYRSIS[17],"High tower'd the spikes of purple orchises,"
9903,THYRSIS[17],Hath since our day put by
9904,THYRSIS[17],The coronals of that forgotten time;
9905,THYRSIS[17],"Down each green bank hath gone the ploughboy's team,"
9906,THYRSIS[17],And only in the hidden brookside gleam
9907,THYRSIS[17],"Primroses, orphans of the flowery prime."
9908,THYRSIS[17],
9909,THYRSIS[17],"Where is the girl, who by the boatman's door,"
9910,THYRSIS[17],"Above the locks, above the boating throng,"
9911,THYRSIS[17],"Unmoor'd our skiff when through the Wytham flats,"
9912,THYRSIS[17],Red loosestrife and blond meadow-sweet among
9913,THYRSIS[17],"And darting swallows and light water-gnats,"
9914,THYRSIS[17],We track'd the shy Thames shore?
9915,THYRSIS[17],"Where are the mowers, who, as the tiny swell"
9916,THYRSIS[17],"Of our boat passing heaved the river-grass,"
9917,THYRSIS[17],Stood with suspended scythe to see us pass?--
9918,THYRSIS[17],"They all are gone, and thou art gone as well!"
9919,THYRSIS[17],
9920,THYRSIS[17],"Yes, thou art gone! and round me too the night"
9921,THYRSIS[17],In ever-nearing circle weaves her shade.
9922,THYRSIS[17],"I see her veil draw soft across the day,"
9923,THYRSIS[17],I feel her slowly chilling breath invade
9924,THYRSIS[17],"The cheek grown thin, the brown hair sprent with grey;"
9925,THYRSIS[17],I feel her finger light
9926,THYRSIS[17],Laid pausefully upon life's headlong train;--
9927,THYRSIS[17],"The foot less prompt to meet the morning dew,"
9928,THYRSIS[17],"The heart less bounding at emotion new,"
9929,THYRSIS[17],"And hope, once crush'd, less quick to spring again."
9930,THYRSIS[17],
9931,THYRSIS[17],"And long the way appears, which seem'd so short"
9932,THYRSIS[17],To the less practised eye of sanguine youth;
9933,THYRSIS[17],"And high the mountain-tops, in cloudy air,"
9934,THYRSIS[17],"The mountain-tops where is the throne of Truth,"
9935,THYRSIS[17],Tops in life's morning-sun so bright and bare!
9936,THYRSIS[17],Unbreachable the fort
9937,THYRSIS[17],Of the long-batter'd world uplifts its wall;
9938,THYRSIS[17],"And strange and vain the earthly turmoil grows,"
9939,THYRSIS[17],"And near and real the charm of thy repose,"
9940,THYRSIS[17],And night as welcome as a friend would fall.
9941,THYRSIS[17],
9942,THYRSIS[17],But hush! the upland hath a sudden loss
9943,THYRSIS[17],"Of quiet!--Look, adown the dusk hill-side,"
9944,THYRSIS[17],"A troop of Oxford hunters going home,"
9945,THYRSIS[17],"As in old days, jovial and talking, ride!"
9946,THYRSIS[17],From hunting with the Berkshire hounds they come.
9947,THYRSIS[17],"Quick! let me fly, and cross"
9948,THYRSIS[17],"Into yon farther field!--'Tis done; and see,"
9949,THYRSIS[17],"Back'd by the sunset, which doth glorify"
9950,THYRSIS[17],"The orange and pale violet evening-sky,"
9951,THYRSIS[17],"Bare on its lonely ridge, the Tree! the Tree!"
9952,THYRSIS[17],
9953,THYRSIS[17],"I take the omen! Eve lets down her veil,"
9954,THYRSIS[17],"The white fog creeps from bush to bush about,"
9955,THYRSIS[17],"The west unflushes, the high stars grow bright,"
9956,THYRSIS[17],And in the scatter'd farms the lights come out.
9957,THYRSIS[17],"I cannot reach the signal-tree to-night,"
9958,THYRSIS[17],"Yet, happy omen, hail!"
9959,THYRSIS[17],Hear it from thy broad lucent Arno-vale
9960,THYRSIS[17],(For there thine earth-forgetting eyelids keep
9961,THYRSIS[17],The morningless and unawakening sleep
9962,THYRSIS[17],"Under the flowery oleanders pale),"
9963,THYRSIS[17],
9964,THYRSIS[17],"Hear it, O Thyrsis, still our tree is there!--"
9965,THYRSIS[17],"Ah, vain! These English fields, this upland dim,"
9966,THYRSIS[17],"These brambles pale with mist engarlanded,"
9967,THYRSIS[17],"That lone, sky-pointing tree, are not for him;"
9968,THYRSIS[17],"To a boon southern country he is fled,"
9969,THYRSIS[17],"And now in happier air,"
9970,THYRSIS[17],Wandering with the great Mother's train divine
9971,THYRSIS[17],"(And purer or more subtle soul than thee,"
9972,THYRSIS[17],"I trow, the mighty Mother doth not see)"
9973,THYRSIS[17],"Within a folding of the Apennine,"
9974,THYRSIS[17],
9975,THYRSIS[17],Thou hearest the immortal chants of old!--
9976,THYRSIS[17],Putting his sickle to the perilous grain
9977,THYRSIS[17],"In the hot cornfield of the Phrygian king,"
9978,THYRSIS[17],For thee the Lityerses-song again
9979,THYRSIS[17],Young Daphnis with his silver voice doth sing;[18]
9980,THYRSIS[17],"Sings his Sicilian fold,"
9981,THYRSIS[17],"His sheep, his hapless love, his blinded eyes--"
9982,THYRSIS[17],"And how a call celestial round him rang,"
9983,THYRSIS[17],"And heavenward from the fountain-brink he sprang,"
9984,THYRSIS[17],And all the marvel of the golden skies.
9985,THYRSIS[17],
9986,THYRSIS[17],"There thou art gone, and me thou leavest here"
9987,THYRSIS[17],Sole in these fields! yet will I not despair.
9988,THYRSIS[17],"Despair I will not, while I yet descry"
9989,THYRSIS[17],Neath the mild canopy of English air
9990,THYRSIS[17],That lonely tree against the western sky.
9991,THYRSIS[17],"Still, still these slopes, 'tis clear,"
9992,THYRSIS[17],"Our Gipsy-Scholar haunts, outliving thee!"
9993,THYRSIS[17],"Fields where soft sheep from cages pull the hay,"
9994,THYRSIS[17],"Woods with anemonies in flower till May,"
9995,THYRSIS[17],Know him a wanderer still; then why not me?
9996,THYRSIS[17],
9997,THYRSIS[17],"A fugitive and gracious light he seeks,"
9998,THYRSIS[17],Shy to illumine; and I seek it too.
9999,THYRSIS[17],"This does not come with houses or with gold,"
10000,THYRSIS[17],"With place, with honour, and a flattering crew;"
10001,THYRSIS[17],'Tis not in the world's market bought and sold--
10002,THYRSIS[17],But the smooth-slipping weeks
10003,THYRSIS[17],"Drop by, and leave its seeker still untired;"
10004,THYRSIS[17],"Out of the heed of mortals he is gone,"
10005,THYRSIS[17],"He wends unfollow'd, he must house alone;"
10006,THYRSIS[17],"Yet on he fares, by his own heart inspired."
10007,THYRSIS[17],
10008,THYRSIS[17],"Thou too, O Thyrsis, on like quest wast bound;"
10009,THYRSIS[17],Thou wanderedst with me for a little hour!
10010,THYRSIS[17],"Men gave thee nothing; but this happy quest,"
10011,THYRSIS[17],"If men esteem'd thee feeble, gave thee power,"
10012,THYRSIS[17],"If men procured thee trouble, gave thee rest."
10013,THYRSIS[17],"And this rude Cumner ground,"
10014,THYRSIS[17],"Its fir-topped Hurst, its farms, its quiet fields,"
10015,THYRSIS[17],"Here cam'st thou in thy jocund youthful time,"
10016,THYRSIS[17],"Here was thine height of strength, thy golden prime!"
10017,THYRSIS[17],And still the haunt beloved a virtue yields.
10018,THYRSIS[17],
10019,THYRSIS[17],What though the music of thy rustic flute
10020,THYRSIS[17],"Kept not for long its happy, country tone;"
10021,THYRSIS[17],"Lost it too soon, and learnt a stormy note"
10022,THYRSIS[17],"Of men contention-tost, of men who groan,"
10023,THYRSIS[17],"Which task'd thy pipe too sore, and tired thy throat--"
10024,THYRSIS[17],"It fail'd, and thou wast mute!"
10025,THYRSIS[17],"Yet hadst thou alway visions of our light,"
10026,THYRSIS[17],"And long with men of care thou couldst not stay,"
10027,THYRSIS[17],"And soon thy foot resumed its wandering way,"
10028,THYRSIS[17],"Left human haunt, and on alone till night."
10029,THYRSIS[17],
10030,THYRSIS[17],"Too rare, too rare, grow now my visits here!"
10031,THYRSIS[17],"'Mid city-noise, not, as with thee of yore,"
10032,THYRSIS[17],Thyrsis! in reach of sheep-bells is my home.
10033,THYRSIS[17],"--Then through the great town's harsh, heart-wearying roar,"
10034,THYRSIS[17],"Let in thy voice a whisper often come,"
10035,THYRSIS[17],To chase fatigue and fear:
10036,THYRSIS[17],_Why faintest thou? I wander'd till I died.
10037,THYRSIS[17],Roam on! The light we sought is shining still.
10038,THYRSIS[17],"Dost thou ask proof? Our tree yet crowns the hill,"
10039,THYRSIS[17],Our Scholar travels yet the loved hill-side._

10102,"APRIL, 1850","The hills were round us, and the breeze"

10104,"APRIL, 1850",Our foreheads felt the wind and rain.

10113,"APRIL, 1850",Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force;
10114,"APRIL, 1850",But where will Europe's latter hour
10115,"APRIL, 1850",Again find Wordsworth's healing power?

10118,"APRIL, 1850",Others will strengthen us to bear--
10119,"APRIL, 1850","But who, ah! who, will make us feel?"
10120,"APRIL, 1850","The cloud of mortal destiny,"

10268,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,
10269,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Slow to a stop, at morning grey,"
10270,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,I see the smoke-crown'd vessel come;
10271,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,Slow round her paddles dies away
10272,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,The seething foam.
10273,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,
10274,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,A boat is lower'd from her side;
10275,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Ah, gently place him on the bench!"
10276,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,That spirit--if all have not yet died--
10277,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,A breath might quench.
10278,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,
10279,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Is this the eye, the footstep fast,"

10293,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,

10316,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"The soft Mediterranean side,"
10317,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"The Nile, the East,"
10318,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"And see all sights from pole to pole,"
10319,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"And glance, and nod, and bustle by,"
10320,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,And never once possess our soul
10321,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,Before we die.

10323,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Not by those hoary Indian hills,"
10324,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,Not by this gracious Midland sea
10325,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Whose floor to-night sweet moonshine fills,"
10326,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,Should our graves be.

10352,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Some youthful troubadour, whose tongue"
10353,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Fill'd Europe once with his love-pain,"
10354,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Who here outworn had sunk, and sung"
10355,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,His dying strain;
10356,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,

10358,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"With furtive step and cheek of flame,"

10371,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,
10372,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"But you--a grave for knight or sage,"

10375,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,Befits you ill.
10376,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,
10377,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"So sang I; but the midnight breeze,"
10378,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Down to the brimm'd, moon-charmed main,"
10379,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"Comes softly through the olive-trees,"
10380,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,And checks my strain.
10381,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,
10382,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"I think of her, whose gentle tongue"

10387,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"That comely face, that cluster'd brow,"
10388,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"That cordial hand, that bearing free,"
10389,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"I see them still, I see them now,"
10390,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,Shall always see!
10391,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,
10392,A SOUTHERN NIGHT,"And what but gentleness untired,"

10672,NOVEMBER 1857,"Path to a clear-purposed goal,"
10673,NOVEMBER 1857,Path of advance!--but it leads
10674,NOVEMBER 1857,"A long, steep journey, through sunk"

10680,NOVEMBER 1857,Lightnings dazzle our eyes.
10681,NOVEMBER 1857,Roaring torrents have breach'd
10682,NOVEMBER 1857,"The track, the stream-bed descends"
10683,NOVEMBER 1857,In the place where the wayfarer once
10684,NOVEMBER 1857,Planted his footstep--the spray
10685,NOVEMBER 1857,Boils o'er its borders! aloft
10686,NOVEMBER 1857,The unseen snow-beds dislodge
10687,NOVEMBER 1857,"Their hanging ruin; alas,"
10688,NOVEMBER 1857,Havoc is made in our train!
10689,NOVEMBER 1857,"Friends, who set forth at our side,"
10690,NOVEMBER 1857,"Falter, are lost in the storm."
10691,NOVEMBER 1857,"We, we only are left!"
10692,NOVEMBER 1857,"With frowning foreheads, with lips"
10693,NOVEMBER 1857,"Sternly compress'd, we strain on,"
10694,NOVEMBER 1857,On--and at nightfall at last
10695,NOVEMBER 1857,"Come to the end of our way,"
10696,NOVEMBER 1857,To the lonely inn 'mid the rocks;
10697,NOVEMBER 1857,Where the gaunt and taciturn host
10698,NOVEMBER 1857,"Stands on the threshold, the wind"
10699,NOVEMBER 1857,Shaking his thin white hairs--
10700,NOVEMBER 1857,Holds his lantern to scan
10701,NOVEMBER 1857,"Our storm-beat figures, and asks:"
10702,NOVEMBER 1857,Whom in our party we bring?
10703,NOVEMBER 1857,Whom we have left in the snow?
10704,NOVEMBER 1857,
10705,NOVEMBER 1857,Sadly we answer: We bring
10706,NOVEMBER 1857,Only ourselves! we lost
10707,NOVEMBER 1857,Sight of the rest in the storm.
10708,NOVEMBER 1857,"Hardly ourselves we fought through,"
10709,NOVEMBER 1857,"Stripp'd, without friends, as we are."
10710,NOVEMBER 1857,"Friends, companions, and train,"
10711,NOVEMBER 1857,The avalanche swept from our side.
10712,NOVEMBER 1857,
10713,NOVEMBER 1857,But thou would'st not _alone_
10714,NOVEMBER 1857,"Be saved, my father! _alone_"
10715,NOVEMBER 1857,"Conquer and come to thy goal,"
10716,NOVEMBER 1857,Leaving the rest in the wild.
10717,NOVEMBER 1857,"We were weary, and we"
10718,NOVEMBER 1857,"Fearful, and we in our march"
10719,NOVEMBER 1857,Fain to drop down and to die.
10720,NOVEMBER 1857,"Still thou turnedst, and still"
10721,NOVEMBER 1857,"Beckonedst the trembler, and still"
10722,NOVEMBER 1857,Gavest the weary thy hand.
10723,NOVEMBER 1857,
10724,NOVEMBER 1857,"If, in the paths of the world,"
10725,NOVEMBER 1857,"Stones might have wounded thy feet,"
10726,NOVEMBER 1857,Toil or dejection have tried
10727,NOVEMBER 1857,"Thy spirit, of that we saw"
10728,NOVEMBER 1857,Nothing--to us thou wast still
10729,NOVEMBER 1857,"Cheerful, and helpful, and firm!"
10730,NOVEMBER 1857,Therefore to thee it was given
10731,NOVEMBER 1857,Many to save with thyself;
10732,NOVEMBER 1857,"And, at the end of thy day,"
10733,NOVEMBER 1857,"O faithful shepherd! to come,"
10734,NOVEMBER 1857,Bringing thy sheep in thy hand.
10735,NOVEMBER 1857,
10736,NOVEMBER 1857,And through thee I believe
10737,NOVEMBER 1857,In the noble and great who are gone;
10738,NOVEMBER 1857,Pure souls honour'd and blest
10739,NOVEMBER 1857,"By former ages, who else--"

10742,NOVEMBER 1857,"Seem'd but a dream of the heart,"
10743,NOVEMBER 1857,Seem'd but a cry of desire.
10744,NOVEMBER 1857,Yes! I believe that there lived
10745,NOVEMBER 1857,"Others like thee in the past,"
10746,NOVEMBER 1857,Not like the men of the crowd
10747,NOVEMBER 1857,Who all round me to-day
10748,NOVEMBER 1857,"Bluster or cringe, and make life"
10749,NOVEMBER 1857,"Hideous, and arid, and vile;"

10769,NOVEMBER 1857,"Ah, but the way is so long!"
10770,NOVEMBER 1857,Years they have been in the wild!
10771,NOVEMBER 1857,"Sore thirst plagues them, the rocks,"
10772,NOVEMBER 1857,"Rising all round, overawe;"

10819,HEINE'S GRAVE,Murmur of Paris outside;
10820,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Crisp everlasting-flowers,"
10821,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Yellow and black, on the graves."
10822,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10823,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Half blind, palsied, in pain,"
10824,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Hither to come, from the streets'"
10825,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Uproar, surely not loath"
10826,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Wast thou, Heine!--to lie"
10827,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Quiet, to ask for closed"
10828,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Shutters, and darken'd room,"
10829,HEINE'S GRAVE,"And cool drinks, and an eased"

10831,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Hither to come, and to sleep"
10832,HEINE'S GRAVE,Under the wings of Renown.
10833,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10834,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Ah! not little, when pain"
10835,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Is most quelling, and man"
10836,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Easily quell'd, and the fine"
10837,HEINE'S GRAVE,Temper of genius so soon
10838,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Thrills at each smart, is the praise,"
10839,HEINE'S GRAVE,Not to have yielded to pain!
10840,HEINE'S GRAVE,"No small boast, for a weak"
10841,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Son of mankind, to the earth"
10842,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Pinn'd by the thunder, to rear"
10843,HEINE'S GRAVE,His bolt-scathed front to the stars;

10846,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Tyrannous tempests of bale,"
10847,HEINE'S GRAVE,Arrowy lightnings of soul.
10848,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10849,HEINE'S GRAVE,Hark! through the alley resounds
10850,HEINE'S GRAVE,Mocking laughter! A film
10851,HEINE'S GRAVE,Creeps o'er the sunshine; a breeze
10852,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Ruffles the warm afternoon,"
10853,HEINE'S GRAVE,Saddens my soul with its chill.
10854,HEINE'S GRAVE,Gibing of spirits in scorn
10855,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Shakes every leaf of the grove,"
10856,HEINE'S GRAVE,Mars the benignant repose
10857,HEINE'S GRAVE,Of this amiable home of the dead.
10858,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10859,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Bitter spirits, ye claim"
10860,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Heine?--Alas, he is yours!"
10861,HEINE'S GRAVE,Only a moment I long'd
10862,HEINE'S GRAVE,Here in the quiet to snatch
10863,HEINE'S GRAVE,From such mates the outworn
10864,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Poet, and steep him in calm."
10865,HEINE'S GRAVE,Only a moment! I knew
10866,HEINE'S GRAVE,Whose he was who is here
10867,HEINE'S GRAVE,Buried--I knew he was yours!
10868,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Ah, I knew that I saw"
10869,HEINE'S GRAVE,Here no sepulchre built
10870,HEINE'S GRAVE,"In the laurell'd rock, o'er the blue"
10871,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Naples bay, for a sweet"
10872,HEINE'S GRAVE,Tender Virgil! no tomb
10873,HEINE'S GRAVE,"On Ravenna sands, in the shade"
10874,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Of Ravenna pines, for a high"
10875,HEINE'S GRAVE,Austere Dante! no grave

10878,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Shakespeare! loveliest of souls,"

10880,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10881,HEINE'S GRAVE,"What, then, so harsh and malign,"
10882,HEINE'S GRAVE,Heine! distils from thy life?
10883,HEINE'S GRAVE,Poisons the peace of the grave?
10884,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10885,HEINE'S GRAVE,"I chide with thee not, that thy sharp"
10886,HEINE'S GRAVE,Upbraidings often assail'd
10887,HEINE'S GRAVE,"England, my country--for we,"
10888,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Heavy and sad, for her sons,"
10889,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Long since, deep in our hearts,"
10890,HEINE'S GRAVE,Echo the blame of her foes.
10891,HEINE'S GRAVE,"We, too, sigh that she flags;"
10892,HEINE'S GRAVE,"We, too, say that she now--"
10893,HEINE'S GRAVE,Scarce comprehending the voice
10894,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Of her greatest, golden-mouth'd sons"
10895,HEINE'S GRAVE,Of a former age any more--
10896,HEINE'S GRAVE,Stupidly travels her round
10897,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Of mechanic business, and lets"
10898,HEINE'S GRAVE,Slow die out of her life
10899,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Glory, and genius, and joy."
10900,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10901,HEINE'S GRAVE,"So thou arraign'st her, her foe;"
10902,HEINE'S GRAVE,"So we arraign her, her sons."
10903,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10904,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Yes, we arraign her! but she,"
10905,HEINE'S GRAVE,"The weary Titan, with deaf"
10906,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Ears, and labour-dimm'd eyes,"
10907,HEINE'S GRAVE,Regarding neither to right
10908,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Nor left, goes passively by,"
10909,HEINE'S GRAVE,Staggering on to her goal;
10910,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Bearing on shoulders immense,"
10911,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Atlanteän, the load,"
10912,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Wellnigh not to be borne,"
10913,HEINE'S GRAVE,Of the too vast orb of her fate.
10914,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10915,HEINE'S GRAVE,But was it thou--I think
10916,HEINE'S GRAVE,Surely it was!--that bard
10917,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Unnamed, who, Goethe said,"
10918,HEINE'S GRAVE,"_Had every other gift, but wanted love;_"
10919,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Love, without which the tongue"
10920,HEINE'S GRAVE,Even of angels sounds amiss?
10921,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10922,HEINE'S GRAVE,Charm is the glory which makes
10923,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Song of the poet divine,"
10924,HEINE'S GRAVE,Love is the fountain of charm.
10925,HEINE'S GRAVE,"How without charm wilt thou draw,"
10926,HEINE'S GRAVE,Poet! the world to thy way?
10927,HEINE'S GRAVE,Not by the lightnings of wit--
10928,HEINE'S GRAVE,Not by the thunder of scorn!
10929,HEINE'S GRAVE,"These to the world, too, are given;"
10930,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Wit it possesses, and scorn--"
10931,HEINE'S GRAVE,Charm is the poet's alone.
10932,HEINE'S GRAVE,"_Hollow and dull are the great,_"
10933,HEINE'S GRAVE,"_And artists envious, and the mob profane._"
10934,HEINE'S GRAVE,"We know all this, we know!"
10935,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Cam'st thou from heaven, O child"
10936,HEINE'S GRAVE,Of light! but this to declare?
10937,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Alas, to help us forget"
10938,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Such barren knowledge awhile,"
10939,HEINE'S GRAVE,God gave the poet his song!
10940,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10941,HEINE'S GRAVE,Therefore a secret unrest
10942,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Tortured thee, brilliant and bold!"
10943,HEINE'S GRAVE,Therefore triumph itself
10944,HEINE'S GRAVE,Tasted amiss to thy soul.
10945,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Therefore, with blood of thy foes,"
10946,HEINE'S GRAVE,Trickled in silence thine own.
10947,HEINE'S GRAVE,Therefore the victor's heart
10948,HEINE'S GRAVE,Broke on the field of his fame.
10949,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10950,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Ah! as of old, from the pomp"
10951,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Of Italian Milan, the fair"
10952,HEINE'S GRAVE,Flower of marble of white
10953,HEINE'S GRAVE,Southern palaces--steps
10954,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Border'd by statues, and walks"
10955,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Terraced, and orange-bowers"
10956,HEINE'S GRAVE,Heavy with fragrance--the blond
10957,HEINE'S GRAVE,German Kaiser full oft
10958,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Long'd himself back to the fields,"
10959,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Rivers, and high-roof'd towns"
10960,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Of his native Germany; so,"
10961,HEINE'S GRAVE,"So, how often! from hot"
10962,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Paris drawing-rooms, and lamps"
10963,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Blazing, and brilliant crowds,"
10964,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Starr'd and jewell'd, of men"
10965,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Famous, of women the queens"
10966,HEINE'S GRAVE,Of dazzling converse--from fumes
10967,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Of praise, hot, heady fumes, to the poor brain"
10968,HEINE'S GRAVE,"That mount, that madden--how oft"
10969,HEINE'S GRAVE,Heine's spirit outworn
10970,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Long'd itself out of the din,"
10971,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Back to the tranquil, the cool"
10972,HEINE'S GRAVE,Far German home of his youth!
10973,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10974,HEINE'S GRAVE,"See! in the May-afternoon,"
10975,HEINE'S GRAVE,"O'er the fresh, short turf of the Hartz,"
10976,HEINE'S GRAVE,"A youth, with the foot of youth,"
10977,HEINE'S GRAVE,Heine! thou climbest again!
10978,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Up, through the tall dark firs"
10979,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Warming their heads in the sun,"
10980,HEINE'S GRAVE,Chequering the grass with their shade--
10981,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Up, by the stream, with its huge"
10982,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Moss-hung boulders, and thin"
10983,HEINE'S GRAVE,Musical water half-hid--
10984,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Up, o'er the rock-strewn slope,"
10985,HEINE'S GRAVE,"With the sinking sun, and the air"
10986,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Chill, and the shadows now"
10987,HEINE'S GRAVE,Long on the grey hill-side--
10988,HEINE'S GRAVE,To the stone-roof'd hut at the top!
10989,HEINE'S GRAVE,
10990,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Or, yet later, in watch"
10991,HEINE'S GRAVE,On the roof of the Brocken-tower
10992,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Thou standest, gazing!--to see"
10993,HEINE'S GRAVE,"The broad red sun, over field,"
10994,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Forest, and city, and spire,"
10995,HEINE'S GRAVE,"And mist-track'd stream of the wide,"
10996,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Wide German land, going down"
10997,HEINE'S GRAVE,In a bank of vapours----again
10998,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Standest, at nightfall, alone!"
10999,HEINE'S GRAVE,
11000,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Or, next morning, with limbs"
11001,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Rested by slumber, and heart"
11002,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Freshen'd and light with the May,"
11003,HEINE'S GRAVE,O'er the gracious spurs coming down
11004,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Of the Lower Hartz, among oaks,"
11005,HEINE'S GRAVE,"And beechen coverts, and copse"
11006,HEINE'S GRAVE,Of hazels green in whose depth
11007,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Ilse, the fairy transform'd,"
11008,HEINE'S GRAVE,In a thousand water-breaks light
11009,HEINE'S GRAVE,Pours her petulant youth--
11010,HEINE'S GRAVE,Climbing the rock which juts
11011,HEINE'S GRAVE,"O'er the valley, the dizzily perch'd"
11012,HEINE'S GRAVE,Rock--to its iron cross
11013,HEINE'S GRAVE,Once more thou cling'st; to the Cross
11014,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Clingest! with smiles, with a sigh!"
11015,HEINE'S GRAVE,
11016,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Goethe, too, had been there.[24]"
11017,HEINE'S GRAVE,In the long-past winter he came
11018,HEINE'S GRAVE,"To the frozen Hartz, with his soul"
11019,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Passionate, eager--his youth"
11020,HEINE'S GRAVE,All in ferment!--but he
11021,HEINE'S GRAVE,Destined to work and to live
11022,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Left it, and thou, alas!"
11023,HEINE'S GRAVE,Only to laugh and to die.
11024,HEINE'S GRAVE,
11025,HEINE'S GRAVE,But something prompts me: Not thus
11026,HEINE'S GRAVE,Take leave of Heine! not thus
11027,HEINE'S GRAVE,Speak the last word at his grave!
11028,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Not in pity, and not"
11029,HEINE'S GRAVE,With half censure--with awe
11030,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Hail, as it passes from earth"
11031,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Scattering lightnings, that soul!"
11032,HEINE'S GRAVE,
11033,HEINE'S GRAVE,"The Spirit of the world,"
11034,HEINE'S GRAVE,Beholding the absurdity of men--
11035,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Their vaunts, their feats--let a sardonic smile,"
11036,HEINE'S GRAVE,"For one short moment, wander o'er his lips."
11037,HEINE'S GRAVE,_That smile was Heine!_--for its earthly hour
11038,HEINE'S GRAVE,The strange guest sparkled; now 'tis pass'd away.
11039,HEINE'S GRAVE,
11040,HEINE'S GRAVE,"That was Heine! and we,"
11041,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Myriads who live, who have lived,"
11042,HEINE'S GRAVE,"What are we all, but a mood,"
11043,HEINE'S GRAVE,"A single mood, of the life"
11044,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Of the Spirit in whom we exist,"
11045,HEINE'S GRAVE,Who alone is all things in one?
11046,HEINE'S GRAVE,
11047,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Spirit, who fillest us all!"
11048,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Spirit, who utterest in each"
11049,HEINE'S GRAVE,New-coming son of mankind
11050,HEINE'S GRAVE,Such of thy thoughts as thou wilt!
11051,HEINE'S GRAVE,"O thou, one of whose moods,"
11052,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Bitter and strange, was the life"
11053,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Of Heine--his strange, alas,"
11054,HEINE'S GRAVE,His bitter life!--may a life
11055,HEINE'S GRAVE,Other and milder be mine!
11056,HEINE'S GRAVE,"May'st thou a mood more serene,"
11057,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Happier, have utter'd in mine!"
11058,HEINE'S GRAVE,May'st thou the rapture of peace
11059,HEINE'S GRAVE,Deep have embreathed at its core;
11060,HEINE'S GRAVE,"Made it a ray of thy thought,"
11061,HEINE'S GRAVE,Made it a beat of thy joy!
11062,HEINE'S GRAVE,

12043,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"of Greece. The doings of the hero Hercules, the ancestor of the"
12044,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Messenian Æpytus, belong to fable; but the invasion of Peloponnesus by"
12045,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"the Dorians under chiefs claiming to be descended from Hercules, and"
12046,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"their settlement in Argos, Lacedæmon, and Messenia, belong to history."
12047,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Æpytus is descended on the father's side from Hercules, Perseus, and the"
12048,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"kings of Argos; on the mother's side from Pelasgus, and the aboriginal"
12049,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"kings of Arcadia. Callisto, the daughter of the wicked Lycaon, and the"
12050,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"mother, by Zeus, of Arcas, from whom the Arcadians took their name, was"
12051,STORY OF THE DRAMA,the granddaughter of Pelasgus. The birth of Arcas brought upon Callisto
12052,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"the anger of the virgin-goddess Artemis, whose service she followed: she"
12053,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"was changed into a she-bear, and in this form was chased by her own son,"
12054,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"grown to manhood. Zeus interposed, and the mother and son were removed"
12055,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"from the earth, and placed among the stars. Callisto became the famous"
12056,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"constellation of the Great Bear; her son became Arcturus, Arctophylax,"
12057,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"or Boötes. From this son of Callisto were descended Cypselus, the"

12061,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"The story of the life of Hercules, the paternal ancestor of Æpytus, is"
12062,STORY OF THE DRAMA,so well known that there is no need to record it. The reader will
12063,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"remember that, although entitled to the throne of Argos by right of"
12064,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"descent from Perseus and Danaus, and to the thrones of Sparta and"
12065,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Messenia by right of conquest, Hercules yet passed his life in labours"
12066,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"and wanderings, subjected by the decree of fate to the commands of his"
12067,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"kinsman, the feeble and malignant Eurystheus. At his death he bequeathed"
12068,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"to his offspring, the Heracleidæ, his own claims to the kingdoms of"
12069,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Peloponnesus, and to the persecution of Eurystheus. They at first sought"
12070,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"shelter with Ceyx, king of Trachis; he was too weak to protect them, and"
12071,STORY OF THE DRAMA,they then took refuge at Athens. The Athenians refused to deliver them
12072,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"up at the demand of Eurystheus; he invaded Attica, and a battle was"
12073,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"fought near Marathon, in which, after Macaria, a daughter of Hercules,"
12074,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"had devoted herself for the preservation of her house, Eurystheus fell,"
12075,STORY OF THE DRAMA,and the Heracleidæ and their Athenian protectors were victorious. The
12076,STORY OF THE DRAMA,memory of Macaria's self-sacrifices was perpetuated by the name of a
12077,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"spring of water on the plain of Marathon, the spring Macaria. The"
12078,STORY OF THE DRAMA,Heracleidæ then endeavoured to effect their return to Peloponnesus.
12079,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Hyllus, the eldest of them, inquired of the oracle at Delphi respecting"
12080,STORY OF THE DRAMA,their return; he was told to return by the _narrow passage_ and in the
12081,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"_third harvest_. Accordingly, in the third year from that time Hyllus"
12082,STORY OF THE DRAMA,led an army to the Isthmus of Corinth; but there he was encountered by
12083,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"an army of Achaians and Arcadians, and fell in single combat with"
12084,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Echemus, king of Tegea. Upon this defeat the Heracleidæ retired to"
12085,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"northern Greece; there, after much wandering, they finally took refuge"
12086,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"with Ægimius, king of the Dorians, who appears to have been the fastest"
12087,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"friend of their house, and whose Dorian warriors formed the army which"
12088,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"at last achieved their return. But, for a hundred years from the date of"
12089,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"their first attempt, the Heracleidæ were defeated in their successive"
12090,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"invasions of Peloponnesus. Cleolaus and Aristomachus, the son and"
12091,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"grandson of Hyllus, fell in unsuccessful expeditions. At length the sons"
12092,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"of Aristomachus, Temenus, Cresphontes, and Aristodemus, when grown up,"
12093,STORY OF THE DRAMA,repaired to Delphi and taxed the oracle with the non-fulfilment of the
12094,STORY OF THE DRAMA,promise made to their ancestor Hyllus. But Apollo replied that his
12095,STORY OF THE DRAMA,oracle had been misunderstood; for that by the _third harvest_ he had
12096,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"meant the third generation, and by the _narrow passage_ he had meant the"
12097,STORY OF THE DRAMA,straits of the Corinthian Gulf. After this explanation the sons of
12098,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Aristomachus built a fleet at Naupactus; and finally, in the hundredth"
12099,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"year from the death of Hyllus and the eightieth from the fall of Troy,"
12100,STORY OF THE DRAMA,the invasion was again attempted and was this time successful. The son
12101,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"of Orestes, Tisamenus, who ruled both Argos and Lacedæmon, fell in"
12102,STORY OF THE DRAMA,battle; many of his vanquished subjects left their homes and took refuge
12103,STORY OF THE DRAMA,in Achaia.
12104,STORY OF THE DRAMA,
12105,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"The spoil was now to be divided among the conquerors. Aristodemus, the"
12106,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"youngest of the sons of Aristomachus, did not survive to enjoy his"
12107,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"share. He was slain at Delphi by the sons of Pylades and Electra, the"
12108,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"kinsman, through their mother, of the house of Agamemnon, that house"
12109,STORY OF THE DRAMA,which the Heracleidæ with their Dorian army had dispossessed. The claims
12110,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"of Aristodemus descended to his two sons, Procles and Eurysthenes,"
12111,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"children under the guardianship of their maternal uncle, Theras."
12112,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Temenus, the eldest of the sons of Aristomachus, took the kingdom of"
12113,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Argos. For the two remaining kingdoms, that of Sparta and that of"
12114,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Messenia, his two nephews, who were to rule jointly, and their uncle"
12115,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Cresphontes, had to cast lots. Cresphontes wished to have the fertile"
12116,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Messenia, and induced his brother to acquiesce in a trick which secured"
12117,STORY OF THE DRAMA,it to him. The lot of Cresphontes and that of his two nephews were to be
12118,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"placed in a water-jar, and thrown out. Messenia was to belong to him"
12119,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"whose lot came out first. With the connivance of Temenus, Cresphontes"
12120,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"marked as his own lot a pellet composed of baked clay, as the lot of his"
12121,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"nephews, a pellet of unbaked clay; the unbaked pellet was of course"
12122,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"dissolved in the water, while the brick pellet fell out alone. Messenia,"
12123,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"therefore, was assigned to Cresphontes."
12124,STORY OF THE DRAMA,
12125,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Messenia was at this time ruled by Melanthus, a descendant of Neleus."
12126,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"This ancestor, a prince of the great house of Æolus, had come from"
12127,STORY OF THE DRAMA,Thessaly and succeeded to the Messenian throne on the failure of the
12128,STORY OF THE DRAMA,previous dynasty. Melanthus and his race were thus foreigners in
12129,STORY OF THE DRAMA,Messenia and were unpopular. His subjects offered little or no
12130,STORY OF THE DRAMA,opposition to the invading Dorians; Melanthus abandoned his kingdom to
12131,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Cresphontes, and retired to Athens."
12132,STORY OF THE DRAMA,
12133,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Cresphontes married Merope, whose native country, Arcadia, was not"
12134,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"affected by the Dorian invasion. This marriage, the issue of which was"
12135,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"three sons, connected him with the native population of Peloponnesus. He"
12136,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"built a new capital of Messenia, Stenyclaros, and transferred thither,"
12137,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"from Pylos, the seat of government; he proposed, moreover, says"
12138,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"Pausanias, to divide Messenia into five states, and to confer on the"
12139,STORY OF THE DRAMA,native Messenians equal privileges with their Dorian conquerors. The
12140,STORY OF THE DRAMA,Dorians complained that his administration unduly favoured the
12141,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"vanquished people; his chief magnates, headed by Polyphontes, himself a"
12142,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"descendant of Hercules, formed a cabal against him, and he was slain"
12143,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"with his two eldest sons. The youngest son of Cresphontes, Æpytus, then"
12144,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"an infant, was saved by his mother, who sent him to her father,"

12147,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"The drama begins at the moment when Æpytus, grown to manhood, returns"
12148,STORY OF THE DRAMA,secretly to Messenia to take vengeance on his father's murderers. At
12149,STORY OF THE DRAMA,this period Temenus was no longer reigning at Argos; he had been
12150,STORY OF THE DRAMA,"murdered by his sons, jealous of their brother-in-law, Deiphontes. The"

13173,GUARDS.,"That will I do, and to this end I came."
13174,GUARDS.,"For, being of like age, of birth not mean,"
13175,GUARDS.,"The son of an Arcadian noble, I"
13176,GUARDS.,Was chosen his companion from a boy;
13177,GUARDS.,"And on the hunting-rambles which his heart,"
13178,GUARDS.,"Unquiet, drove him ever to pursue"
13179,GUARDS.,"Through all the lordships of the Arcadian dales,"
13180,GUARDS.,"From chief to chief, I wander'd at his side,"
13181,GUARDS.,"The captain of his squires, and his guard."
13182,GUARDS.,"On such a hunting-journey, three morns since,"
13183,GUARDS.,"With beaters, hounds, and huntsmen, he and I"
13184,GUARDS.,"Set forth from Tegea, the royal town."
13185,GUARDS.,"The prince at start seem'd sad, but his regard"
13186,GUARDS.,Clear'd with blithe travel and the morning air.
13187,GUARDS.,"We rode from Tegea, through the woods of oaks,"
13188,GUARDS.,"Past Arnê spring, where Rhea gave the babe"
13189,GUARDS.,Poseidon to the shepherd-boys to hide
13190,GUARDS.,"From Saturn's search among the new-yean'd lambs,"
13191,GUARDS.,"To Mantineia, with its unbaked walls;"
13192,GUARDS.,"Thence, by the Sea-God's Sanctuary and the tomb"
13193,GUARDS.,Whither from wintry Mænalus were brought
13194,GUARDS.,"The bones of Arcas, whence our race is named,"
13195,GUARDS.,"On, to the marshy Orchomenian plain,"
13196,GUARDS.,"And the Stone Coffins;--then, by Caphyæ Cliffs,"
13197,GUARDS.,To Pheneos with its craggy citadel.
13198,GUARDS.,"There, with the chief of that hill-town, we lodged"
13199,GUARDS.,One night; and the next day at dawn fared on
13200,GUARDS.,By the Three Fountains and the Adder's Hill
13201,GUARDS.,"To the Stymphalian Lake, our journey's end,"
13202,GUARDS.,To draw the coverts on Cyllenê's side.
13203,GUARDS.,"There, on a high green spur which bathes its point"
13204,GUARDS.,"Far in the liquid lake, we sate, and drew"
13205,GUARDS.,"Cates from our hunters' pouch, Arcadian fare,"
13206,GUARDS.,"Sweet chestnuts, barley-cakes, and boar's-flesh dried;"
13207,GUARDS.,"And as we ate, and rested there, we talk'd"
13208,GUARDS.,"Of places we had pass'd, sport we had had,"
13209,GUARDS.,"Of beasts of chase that haunt the Arcadian hills,"
13210,GUARDS.,"Wild hog, and bear, and mountain-deer, and roe;"
13211,GUARDS.,"Last, of our quarters with the Arcadian chiefs."
13212,GUARDS.,"For courteous entertainment, welcome warm,"
13213,GUARDS.,"Sad, reverential homage, had our prince"
13214,GUARDS.,"From all, for his great lineage and his woes;"
13215,GUARDS.,"All which he own'd, and praised with grateful mind."
13216,GUARDS.,"But still over his speech a gloom there hung,"
13217,GUARDS.,As of one shadow'd by impending death;
13218,GUARDS.,"And strangely, as we talk'd, he would apply"
13219,GUARDS.,The story of spots mention'd to his own;
13220,GUARDS.,"Telling us, Arnê minded him, he too"
13221,GUARDS.,"Was saved a babe, but to a life obscure,"
13222,GUARDS.,"Which he, the seed of Heracles, dragg'd on"
13223,GUARDS.,"Inglorious, and should drop at last unknown,"
13224,GUARDS.,"Even as those dead unepitaph'd, who lie"
13225,GUARDS.,In the stone coffins at Orchomenus.
13226,GUARDS.,"And, then, he bade remember how we pass'd"
13227,GUARDS.,"The Mantineän Sanctuary, forbid"
13228,GUARDS.,"To foot of mortal, where his ancestor,"
13229,GUARDS.,"Named Æpytus like him, having gone in,"
13230,GUARDS.,Was blinded by the outgushing springs of brine.
13231,GUARDS.,"Then, turning westward to the Adder's Hill--"
13232,GUARDS.,"_Another ancestor, named, too, like me,_"
13233,GUARDS.,"_Died of a snake-bite_, said he, _on that brow;_"
13234,GUARDS.,"_Still at his mountain-tomb men marvel, built_"
13235,GUARDS.,"_Where, as life ebb'd, his bearers laid him down._"
13236,GUARDS.,"So he play'd on; then ended, with a smile:"
13237,GUARDS.,_This region is not happy for my race._
13238,GUARDS.,"We cheer'd him; but, that moment, from the copse"
13239,GUARDS.,"By the lake-edge, broke the sharp cry of hounds;"
13240,GUARDS.,The prickers shouted that the stag was gone.
13241,GUARDS.,"We sprang upon our feet, we snatch'd our spears,"
13242,GUARDS.,"We bounded down the swarded slope, we plunged"
13243,GUARDS.,Through the dense ilex-thickets to the dogs.
13244,GUARDS.,Far in the woods ahead their music rang;
13245,GUARDS.,And many times that morn we coursed in ring
13246,GUARDS.,The forests round that belt Cyllenê's side;
13247,GUARDS.,"Till I, thrown out and tired, came to halt"
13248,GUARDS.,On that same spur where we had sate at morn.
13249,GUARDS.,"And resting there to breathe, I watch'd the chase--"
13250,GUARDS.,"Rare, straggling hunters, foil'd by brake and crag,"
13251,GUARDS.,"And the prince, single, pressing on the rear"
13252,GUARDS.,Of that unflagging quarry and the hounds.
13253,GUARDS.,Now in the woods far down I saw them cross
13254,GUARDS.,An open glade; now he was high aloft
13255,GUARDS.,"On some tall scar fringed with dark feathery pines,"
13256,GUARDS.,"Peering to spy a goat-track down the cliff,"
13257,GUARDS.,"Cheering with hand, and voice, and horn his dogs."
13258,GUARDS.,At last the cry drew to the water's edge--
13259,GUARDS.,"And through the brushwood, to the pebbly strand,"
13260,GUARDS.,"Broke, black with sweat, the antler'd mountain-stag,"
13261,GUARDS.,"And took the lake. Two hounds alone pursued,"
13262,GUARDS.,Then came the prince; he shouted and plunged in.
13263,GUARDS.,--There is a chasm rifted in the base
13264,GUARDS.,"Of that unfooted precipice, whose rock"
13265,GUARDS.,Walls on one side the deep Stymphalian Lake;
13266,GUARDS.,"There the lake-waters, which in ages gone"
13267,GUARDS.,"Wash'd, as the marks upon the hills still show,"
13268,GUARDS.,"All the Stymphalian plain, are now suck'd down."
13269,GUARDS.,"A headland, with one aged plane-tree crown'd,"
13270,GUARDS.,Parts from this cave-pierced cliff the shelving bay
13271,GUARDS.,"Where first the chase plunged in; the bay is smooth,"
13272,GUARDS.,"But round the headland's point a current sets,"
13273,GUARDS.,"Strong, black, tempestuous, to the cavern-mouth."
13274,GUARDS.,"Stoutly, under the headland's lee, they swam;"
13275,GUARDS.,"But when they came abreast the point, the race"
13276,GUARDS.,"Caught them as wind takes feathers, whirl'd them round"
13277,GUARDS.,"Struggling in vain to cross it, swept them on,"
13278,GUARDS.,"Stag, dogs, and hunter, to the yawning gulph."
13279,GUARDS.,"All this, O King, not piecemeal, as to thee"
13280,GUARDS.,"Now told, but in one flashing instant pass'd."
13281,GUARDS.,While from the turf whereon I lay I sprang
13282,GUARDS.,"And took three strides, quarry and dogs were gone;"
13283,GUARDS.,A moment more--I saw the prince turn round
13284,GUARDS.,"Once in the black and arrowy race, and cast"
13285,GUARDS.,An arm aloft for help; then sweep beneath
13286,GUARDS.,"The low-brow'd cavern-arch, and disappear."
13287,GUARDS.,"And what I could, I did--to call by cries"
13288,GUARDS.,"Some straggling hunters to my aid, to rouse"
13289,GUARDS.,"Fishers who live on the lake-side, to launch"
13290,GUARDS.,"Boats, and approach, near as we dared, the chasm."
13291,GUARDS.,"But of the prince nothing remain'd, save this,"
13292,GUARDS.,"His boar-spear's broken shaft, back on the lake"
13293,GUARDS.,Cast by the rumbling subterranean stream;
13294,GUARDS.,"And this, at landing spied by us and saved,"
13295,GUARDS.,"His broad-brimm'd hunter's hat, which, in the bay,"
13296,GUARDS.,"Where first the stag took water, floated still."
13297,GUARDS.,And I across the mountains brought with haste
13298,GUARDS.,"To Cypselus, at Basilis, this news--"

13304,GUARDS.,Extinguishes distrust 'twixt him and thee.

15294,CALLICLES,"Their tinkling bells, mix'd with the song of birds,"
15295,CALLICLES,Rise faintly to me--now it stops!--Who's here?
15296,CALLICLES,Pausanias! and on foot? alone?
15297,CALLICLES,
15298,CALLICLES,_Pausanias_
15299,CALLICLES,
15300,CALLICLES,"And thou, then?"
15301,CALLICLES,"I left thee supping with Peisianax,"
15302,CALLICLES,"With thy head full of wine, and thy hair crown'd,"
15303,CALLICLES,"Touching thy harp as the whim came on thee,"
15304,CALLICLES,And praised and spoil'd by master and by guests
15305,CALLICLES,Almost as much as the new dancing-girl.
15306,CALLICLES,Why hast thou follow'd us?
15307,CALLICLES,
15308,CALLICLES,_Callicles_
15309,CALLICLES,
15310,CALLICLES,"The night was hot,"
15311,CALLICLES,"And the feast past its prime; so we slipp'd out,"
15312,CALLICLES,"Some of us, to the portico to breathe;--"
15313,CALLICLES,"Peisianax, thou know'st, drinks late;--and then,"
15314,CALLICLES,"As I was lifting my soil'd garland off,"
15315,CALLICLES,"I saw the mules and litter in the court,"
15316,CALLICLES,And in the litter sate Empedocles;
15317,CALLICLES,"Thou, too, wast with him. Straightway I sped home;"
15318,CALLICLES,"I saddled my white mule, and all night long"
15319,CALLICLES,"Through the cool lovely country follow'd you,"
15320,CALLICLES,"Pass'd you a little since as morning dawn'd,"
15321,CALLICLES,"And have this hour sate by the torrent here,"
15322,CALLICLES,Till the slow mules should climb in sight again.
15323,CALLICLES,And now?
15324,CALLICLES,
15325,CALLICLES,_Pausanias_
15326,CALLICLES,
15327,CALLICLES,"And now, back to the town with speed!"
15328,CALLICLES,"Crouch in the wood first, till the mules have pass'd;"
15329,CALLICLES,"They do but halt, they will be here anon."
15330,CALLICLES,Thou must be viewless to Empedocles;
15331,CALLICLES,"Save mine, he must not meet a human eye."
15332,CALLICLES,One of his moods is on him that thou know'st;
15333,CALLICLES,"I think, thou wouldst not vex him."
15334,CALLICLES,
15335,CALLICLES,_Callicles_
15336,CALLICLES,
15337,CALLICLES,No--and yet
15338,CALLICLES,"I would fain stay, and help thee tend him. Once"
15339,CALLICLES,"He knew me well, and would oft notice me;"
15340,CALLICLES,"And still, I know not how, he draws me to him,"
15341,CALLICLES,"And I could watch him with his proud sad face,"
15342,CALLICLES,His flowing locks and gold-encircled brow
15343,CALLICLES,"And kingly gait, for ever; such a spell"
15344,CALLICLES,"In his severe looks, such a majesty"
15345,CALLICLES,"As drew of old the people after him,"
15346,CALLICLES,"In Agrigentum and Olympia,"
15347,CALLICLES,"When his star reign'd, before his banishment,"
15348,CALLICLES,Is potent still on me in his decline.
15349,CALLICLES,"But oh! Pausanias, he is changed of late;"
15350,CALLICLES,There is a settled trouble in his air
15351,CALLICLES,"Admits no momentary brightening now,"
15352,CALLICLES,"And when he comes among his friends at feasts,"
15353,CALLICLES,'Tis as an orphan among prosperous boys.
15354,CALLICLES,"Thou know'st of old he loved this harp of mine,"
15355,CALLICLES,When first he sojourn'd with Peisianax;
15356,CALLICLES,"He is now always moody, and I fear him;"
15357,CALLICLES,"But I would serve him, soothe him, if I could,"
15358,CALLICLES,Dared one but try.
15359,CALLICLES,
15360,CALLICLES,_Pausanias_
15361,CALLICLES,
15362,CALLICLES,Thou wast a kind child ever!
15363,CALLICLES,"He loves thee, but he must not see thee now."
15364,CALLICLES,"Thou hast indeed a rare touch on thy harp,"
15365,CALLICLES,"He loves that in thee, too;--there was a time"
15366,CALLICLES,"(But that is pass'd), he would have paid thy strain"
15367,CALLICLES,With music to have drawn the stars from heaven.
15368,CALLICLES,"He hath his harp and laurel with him still,"
15369,CALLICLES,"But he has laid the use of music by,"
15370,CALLICLES,And all which might relax his settled gloom.
15371,CALLICLES,"Yet thou may'st try thy playing, if thou wilt--"
15372,CALLICLES,"But thou must keep unseen; follow us on,"
15373,CALLICLES,"But at a distance! in these solitudes,"
15374,CALLICLES,"In this clear mountain-air, a voice will rise,"
15375,CALLICLES,"Though from afar, distinctly; it may soothe him."
15376,CALLICLES,"Play when we halt, and, when the evening comes"
15377,CALLICLES,And I must leave him (for his pleasure is
15378,CALLICLES,To be left musing these soft nights alone
15379,CALLICLES,"In the high unfrequented mountain-spots),"
15380,CALLICLES,"Then watch him, for he ranges swift and far,"
15381,CALLICLES,"Sometimes to Etna's top, and to the cone;"
15382,CALLICLES,"But hide thee in the rocks a great way down,"
15383,CALLICLES,"And try thy noblest strains, my Callicles,"
15384,CALLICLES,With the sweet night to help thy harmony!
15385,CALLICLES,"Thou wilt earn my thanks sure, and perhaps his."
15386,CALLICLES,
15387,CALLICLES,_Callicles_
15388,CALLICLES,
15389,CALLICLES,"More than a day and night, Pausanias,"
15390,CALLICLES,"Of this fair summer-weather, on these hills,"
15391,CALLICLES,Would I bestow to help Empedocles.
15392,CALLICLES,That needs no thanks; one is far better here
15393,CALLICLES,Than in the broiling city in these heats.
15394,CALLICLES,"But tell me, how hast them persuaded him"
15395,CALLICLES,"In this his present fierce, man-hating mood,"
15396,CALLICLES,To bring thee out with him alone on Etna?
15397,CALLICLES,
15398,CALLICLES,_Pausanias_
15399,CALLICLES,
15400,CALLICLES,Thou hast heard all men speaking of Pantheia
15401,CALLICLES,The woman who at Agrigentum lay
15402,CALLICLES,"Thirty long days in a cold trance of death,"
15403,CALLICLES,And whom Empedocles call'd back to life.
15404,CALLICLES,"Thou art too young to note it, but his power"
15405,CALLICLES,"Swells with the swelling evil of this time,"
15406,CALLICLES,And holds men mute to see where it will rise.
15407,CALLICLES,"He could stay swift diseases in old days,"
15408,CALLICLES,"Chain madmen by the music of his lyre,"
15409,CALLICLES,"Cleanse to sweet airs the breath of poisonous streams,"
15410,CALLICLES,And in the mountain-chinks inter the winds.
15411,CALLICLES,"This he could do of old; but now, since all"
15412,CALLICLES,"Clouds and grows daily worse in Sicily,"
15413,CALLICLES,"Since broils tear us in twain, since this new swarm"
15414,CALLICLES,Of sophists has got empire in our schools
15415,CALLICLES,"Where he was paramount, since he is banish'd"
15416,CALLICLES,And lives a lonely man in triple gloom--
15417,CALLICLES,He grasps the very reins of life and death.
15418,CALLICLES,"I ask'd him of Pantheia yesterday,"
15419,CALLICLES,"When we were gather'd with Peisianax,"
15420,CALLICLES,"And he made answer, I should come at night"
15421,CALLICLES,"On Etna here, and be alone with him,"
15422,CALLICLES,"And he would tell me, as his old, tried friend,"
15423,CALLICLES,"Who still was faithful, what might profit me;"
15424,CALLICLES,"That is, the secret of this miracle."
15425,CALLICLES,
15426,CALLICLES,_Callicles_
15427,CALLICLES,
15428,CALLICLES,Bah! Thou a doctor! Thou art superstitious.
15429,CALLICLES,"Simple Pausanias, 'twas no miracle!"
15430,CALLICLES,"Pantheia, for I know her kinsmen well,"
15431,CALLICLES,Was subject to these trances from a girl.
15432,CALLICLES,"Empedocles would say so, did he deign;"
15433,CALLICLES,"But he still lets the people, whom he scorns,"
15434,CALLICLES,"Gape and cry _wizard_ at him, if they list."
15435,CALLICLES,"But thou, thou art no company for him!"
15436,CALLICLES,"Thou art as cross, as sour'd as himself!"
15437,CALLICLES,"Thou hast some wrong from thine own citizens,"
15438,CALLICLES,"And then thy friend is banish'd, and on that,"
15439,CALLICLES,"Straightway thou fallest to arraign the times,"
15440,CALLICLES,As if the sky was impious not to fall.
15441,CALLICLES,The sophists are no enemies of his;
15442,CALLICLES,"I hear, Gorgias, their chief, speaks nobly of him,"
15443,CALLICLES,"As of his gifted master, and once friend."
15444,CALLICLES,"He is too scornful, too high-wrought, too bitter."
15445,CALLICLES,"'Tis not the times, 'tis not the sophists vex him;"
15446,CALLICLES,"There is some root of suffering in himself,"
15447,CALLICLES,"Some secret and unfollow'd vein of woe,"
15448,CALLICLES,Which makes the time look black and sad to him.
15449,CALLICLES,Pester him not in this his sombre mood
15450,CALLICLES,"With questionings about an idle tale,"
15451,CALLICLES,"But lead him through the lovely mountain-paths,"
15452,CALLICLES,"And keep his mind from preying on itself,"
15453,CALLICLES,"And talk to him of things at hand and common,"
15454,CALLICLES,"Not miracles! thou art a learned man,"
15455,CALLICLES,But credulous of fables as a girl.
15456,CALLICLES,
15457,CALLICLES,_Pausanias_
15458,CALLICLES,
15459,CALLICLES,"And thou, a boy whose tongue outruns his knowledge,"
15460,CALLICLES,And on whose lightness blame is thrown away.
15461,CALLICLES,Enough of this! I see the litter wind
15462,CALLICLES,"Up by the torrent-side, under the pines."
15463,CALLICLES,I must rejoin Empedocles. Do thou
15464,CALLICLES,Crouch in the brushwood till the mules have pass'd;
15465,CALLICLES,Then play thy kind part well. Farewell till night!

15479,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Upon the open shoulder of the hill.
15480,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,See how the giant spires of yellow bloom
15481,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Of the sun-loving gentian, in the heat,"
15482,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Are shining on those naked slopes like flame!

15491,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And we were not so far from human haunt,"

15500,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"In summer, to all country-festivals,"
15501,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,With a gay revelling band; he breaks from them
15502,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Sometimes, and wanders far among the glens."
15503,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"But heed him not, he will not mount to us;"
15504,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"I spoke with him this morning. Once more, therefore,"
15505,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Instruct me of Pantheia's story, Master,"

15516,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Visit us as they do with sign and plague,"
15517,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,To know those spells of thine which stay their hand
15518,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Were to live free from terror.

15647,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The dead return to life,"
15648,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Rivers are dried, winds stay'd;"
15649,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Scarce can one think in calm, so threatening are the Gods;"
15650,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15651,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And we feel, day and night,"
15652,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The burden of ourselves--
15653,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Well, then, the wiser wight"
15654,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"In his own bosom delves,"
15655,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And asks what ails him so, and gets what cure he can."
15656,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15657,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The sophist sneers: Fool, take"
15658,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Thy pleasure, right or wrong."
15659,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The pious wail: Forsake
15660,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,A world these sophists throng.
15661,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Be neither saint nor sophist-led, but be a man!"
15662,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15663,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,These hundred doctors try
15664,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,To preach thee to their school.
15665,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,We have the truth! they cry;
15666,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And yet their oracle,"
15667,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Trumpet it as they will, is but the same as thine."
15668,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15669,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Once read thy own breast right,"
15670,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And thou hast done with fears;
15671,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Man gets no other light,"
15672,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Search he a thousand years.
15673,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Sink in thyself! there ask what ails thee, at that shrine!"
15674,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15675,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,What makes thee struggle and rave?
15676,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Why are men ill at ease?--
15677,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,'Tis that the lot they have
15678,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Fails their own will to please;
15679,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"For man would make no murmuring, were his will obey'd."
15680,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15681,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And why is it, that still"
15682,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Man with his lot thus fights?--
15683,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,'Tis that he makes this _will_
15684,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The measure of his _rights_,"
15685,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And believes Nature outraged if his will's gainsaid.
15686,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15687,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Couldst thou, Pausanias, learn"
15688,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,How deep a fault is this;
15689,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Couldst thou but once discern
15690,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Thou hast no _right_ to bliss,"
15691,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,No title from the Gods to welfare and repose;
15692,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15693,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Then thou wouldst look less mazed
15694,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Whene'er of bliss debarr'd,"
15695,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Nor think the Gods were crazed
15696,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,When thy own lot went hard.
15697,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,But we are all the same--the fools of our own woes!
15698,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15699,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"For, from the first faint morn"
15700,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Of life, the thirst for bliss"
15701,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Deep in man's heart is born;
15702,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And, sceptic as he is,"
15703,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,He fails not to judge clear if this be quench'd or no.
15704,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15705,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Nor is the thirst to blame.
15706,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Man errs not that he deems
15707,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"His welfare his true aim,"
15708,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,He errs because he dreams
15709,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The world does but exist that welfare to bestow.
15710,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15711,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,We mortals are no kings
15712,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,For each of whom to sway
15713,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"A new-made world up-springs,"
15714,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Meant merely for his play;
15715,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"No, we are strangers here; the world is from of old."
15716,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15717,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"In vain our pent wills fret,"
15718,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And would the world subdue.
15719,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Limits we did not set
15720,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Condition all we do;
15721,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Born into life we are, and life must be our mould."
15722,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15723,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Born into life!--man grows
15724,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Forth from his parents' stem,"
15725,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And blends their bloods, as those"
15726,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Of theirs are blent in them;
15727,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,So each new man strikes root into a far fore-time.
15728,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15729,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Born into life!--we bring
15730,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"A bias with us here,"
15731,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And, when here, each new thing"
15732,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Affects us we come near;
15733,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,To tunes we did not call our being must keep chime.
15734,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15735,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Born into life!--in vain,"
15736,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Opinions, those or these,"
15737,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Unalter'd to retain
15738,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The obstinate mind decrees;
15739,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Experience, like a sea, soaks all-effacing in."
15740,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15741,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Born into life!--who lists
15742,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"May what is false hold dear,"
15743,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And for himself make mists
15744,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Through which to see less clear;
15745,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The world is what it is, for all our dust and din."
15746,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15747,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Born into life!--'tis we,"
15748,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And not the world, are new;"
15749,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Our cry for bliss, our plea,"
15750,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Others have urged it too--
15751,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Our wants have all been felt, our errors made before."
15752,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15753,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,No eye could be too sound
15754,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"To observe a world so vast,"
15755,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,No patience too profound
15756,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,To sort what's here amass'd;
15757,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,How man may here best live no care too great to explore.
15758,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15759,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,But we--as some rude guest
15760,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Would change, where'er he roam,"
15761,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The manners there profess'd
15762,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,To those he brings from home--
15763,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We mark not the world's course, but would have _it_ take _ours_."
15764,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15765,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The world's course proves the terms
15766,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,On which man wins content;
15767,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Reason the proof confirms--
15768,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We spurn it, and invent"
15769,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"A false course for the world, and for ourselves, false powers."
15770,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15771,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Riches we wish to get,"
15772,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Yet remain spendthrifts still;
15773,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We would have health, and yet"
15774,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Still use our bodies ill;
15775,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Bafflers of our own prayers, from youth to life's last scenes."
15776,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15777,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We would have inward peace,"
15778,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Yet will not look within;
15779,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We would have misery cease,"
15780,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Yet will not cease from sin;
15781,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We want all pleasant ends, but will use no harsh means;"
15782,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15783,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We do not what we ought,"
15784,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"What we ought not, we do,"
15785,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And lean upon the thought
15786,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,That chance will bring us through;
15787,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"But our own acts, for good or ill, are mightier powers."
15788,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15789,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Yet, even when man forsakes"
15790,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"All sin,--is just, is pure,"
15791,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Abandons all which makes
15792,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"His welfare insecure,--"
15793,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Other existences there are, that clash with ours."
15794,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15795,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Like us, the lightning-fires"
15796,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Love to have scope and play;
15797,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The stream, like us, desires"
15798,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,An unimpeded way;
15799,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Like us, the Libyan wind delights to roam at large."
15800,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15801,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Streams will not curb their pride
15802,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The just man not to entomb,"
15803,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Nor lightnings go aside
15804,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,To give his virtues room;
15805,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Nor is that wind less rough which blows a good man's barge.
15806,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15807,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Nature, with equal mind,"
15808,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Sees all her sons at play;
15809,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Sees man control the wind,"
15810,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The wind sweep man away;
15811,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Allows the proudly-riding and the foundering bark.
15812,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15813,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And, lastly, though of ours"
15814,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"No weakness spoil our lot,"
15815,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Though the non-human powers
15816,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Of Nature harm us not,"
15817,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The ill deeds of other men make often _our_ life dark.
15818,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15819,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,What were the wise man's plan?--
15820,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Through this sharp, toil-set life,"
15821,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"To work as best he can,"
15822,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And win what's won by strife.--
15823,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,But we an easier way to cheat our pains have found.
15824,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15825,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Scratch'd by a fall, with moans"
15826,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,As children of weak age
15827,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Lend life to the dumb stones
15828,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Whereon to vent their rage,"
15829,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And bend their little fists, and rate the senseless ground;"
15830,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15831,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"So, loath to suffer mute,"
15832,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We, peopling the void air,"
15833,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Make Gods to whom to impute
15834,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The ills we ought to bear;
15835,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"With God and Fate to rail at, suffering easily."
15836,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15837,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Yet grant--as sense long miss'd
15838,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Things that are now perceived,"
15839,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And much may still exist
15840,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Which is not yet believed--
15841,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Grant that the world were full of Gods we cannot see;
15842,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,All things the world which fill
15843,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Of but one stuff are spun,"
15844,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"That we who rail are still,"
15845,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"With what we rail at, one;"
15846,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,One with the o'erlabour'd Power that through the breadth and length
15847,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15848,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Of earth, and air, and sea,"
15849,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"In men, and plants, and stones,"
15850,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Hath toil perpetually,"
15851,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And travails, pants, and moans;"
15852,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Fain would do all things well, but sometimes fails in strength."
15853,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15854,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And patiently exact
15855,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,This universal God
15856,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Alike to any act
15857,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Proceeds at any nod,"
15858,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And quietly declaims the cursings of himself.
15859,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15860,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"This is not what man hates,"
15861,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Yet he can curse but this.
15862,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Harsh Gods and hostile Fates
15863,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Are dreams! this only _is_--
15864,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Is everywhere; sustains the wise, the foolish elf."
15865,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15866,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Nor only, in the intent"
15867,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"To attach blame elsewhere,"
15868,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Do we at will invent
15869,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Stern Powers who make their care
15870,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"To embitter human life, malignant Deities;"
15871,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15872,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"But, next, we would reverse"
15873,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The scheme ourselves have spun,"
15874,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And what we made to curse
15875,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We now would lean upon,"
15876,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And feign kind Gods who perfect what man vainly tries.
15877,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15878,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Look, the world tempts our eye,"
15879,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And we would know it all!
15880,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We map the starry sky,"
15881,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We mine this earthen ball,"
15882,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We measure the sea-tides, we number the sea-sands;"
15883,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15884,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,We scrutinise the dates
15885,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Of long-past human things,"
15886,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The bounds of effaced states,"
15887,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The lines of deceased kings;
15888,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We search out dead men's words, and works of dead men's hands;"
15889,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15890,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We shut our eyes, and muse"
15891,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"How our own minds are made,"
15892,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"What springs of thought they use,"
15893,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"How righten'd, how betray'd--"
15894,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And spend our wit to name what most employ unnamed.
15895,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15896,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"But still, as we proceed"
15897,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The mass swells more and more
15898,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Of volumes yet to read,"
15899,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Of secrets yet to explore.
15900,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Our hair grows grey, our eyes are dimm'd, our heat is tamed;"
15901,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15902,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We rest our faculties,"
15903,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And thus address the Gods:
15904,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"""True science if there is,"
15905,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,It stays in your abodes!
15906,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Man's measures cannot mete the immeasurable All.
15907,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15908,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"""You only can take in"
15909,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The world's immense design.
15910,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Our desperate search was sin,"
15911,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Which henceforth we resign,"
15912,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Sure only that your mind sees all things which befal."""
15913,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15914,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Fools! That in man's brief term
15915,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"He cannot all things view,"
15916,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Affords no ground to affirm
15917,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,That there are Gods who do;
15918,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Nor does being weary prove that he has where to rest.
15919,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15920,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Again.--Our youthful blood
15921,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Claims rapture as its right;
15922,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The world, a rolling flood"
15923,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Of newness and delight,"
15924,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Draws in the enamour'd gazer to its shining breast;
15925,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15926,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Pleasure, to our hot grasp,"
15927,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Gives flowers, after flowers;"
15928,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,With passionate warmth we clasp
15929,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Hand after hand in ours;
15930,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Now do we soon perceive how fast our youth is spent.
15931,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15932,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,At once our eyes grow clear!
15933,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We see, in blank dismay,"
15934,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Year posting after year,"
15935,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Sense after sense decay;
15936,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Our shivering heart is mined by secret discontent;
15937,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15938,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Yet still, in spite of truth,"
15939,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"In spite of hopes entomb'd,"
15940,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,That longing of our youth
15941,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Burns ever unconsumed,"
15942,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Still hungrier for delight as delights grow more rare.
15943,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15944,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"We pause; we hush our heart,"
15945,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And thus address the Gods:
15946,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"""The world hath fail'd to impart"
15947,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"The joy our youth forebodes,"
15948,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Fail'd to fill up the void which in our breasts we bear.
15949,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15950,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"""Changeful till now, we still"
15951,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Look'd on to something new;
15952,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Let us, with changeless will,"
15953,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Henceforth look on to you,"
15954,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"To find with you the joy we in vain here require!"""
15955,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15956,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Fools! That so often here
15957,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Happiness mock'd our prayer,"
15958,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"I think, might make us fear"
15959,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,A like event elsewhere;
15960,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Make us, not fly to dreams, but moderate desire."
15961,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15962,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And yet, for those who know"
15963,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Themselves, who wisely take"
15964,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Their way through life, and bow"
15965,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"To what they cannot break,"
15966,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,Why should I say that life need yield but _moderate_ bliss?
15967,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,
15968,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Shall we, with temper spoil'd,"
15969,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Health sapp'd by living ill,"
15970,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And judgment all embroil'd
15971,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"By sadness and self-will,"

16013,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Far, far from here,"
16014,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,The Adriatic breaks in a warm bay

16021,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"And there, they say, two bright and aged snakes,"
16022,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Who once were Cadmus and Harmonia,"
16023,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,"Bask in the glens or on the warm sea-shore,"

16038,EMPEDOCLES--PAUSANIAS,And at the banquet all the Muses sang.

16251,EMPEDOCLES,Oh! that Fate had let me see
16252,EMPEDOCLES,"That triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre,"
16253,EMPEDOCLES,"That famous, final victory,"
16254,EMPEDOCLES,When jealous Pan with Marsyas did conspire;

16256,EMPEDOCLES,"When, from far Parnassus' side,"
16257,EMPEDOCLES,"Young Apollo, all the pride"
16258,EMPEDOCLES,"Of the Phrygian flutes to tame,"
16259,EMPEDOCLES,To the Phrygian highlands came;
16260,EMPEDOCLES,Where the long green reed-beds sway
16261,EMPEDOCLES,In the rippled waters grey
16262,EMPEDOCLES,Of that solitary lake
16263,EMPEDOCLES,Where Mæander's springs are born;
16264,EMPEDOCLES,Whence the ridged pine-wooded roots
16265,EMPEDOCLES,"Of Messogis westward break,"
16266,EMPEDOCLES,"Mounting westward, high and higher."
16267,EMPEDOCLES,There was held the famous strife;
16268,EMPEDOCLES,"There the Phrygian brought his flutes,"
16269,EMPEDOCLES,And Apollo brought his lyre;
16270,EMPEDOCLES,"And, when now the westering sun"
16271,EMPEDOCLES,"Touch'd the hills, the strife was done,"
16272,EMPEDOCLES,And the attentive Muses said:

16283,EMPEDOCLES,"Flinging on the mountain-sod,"
16284,EMPEDOCLES,With a lovely frighten'd mien
16285,EMPEDOCLES,Came about the youthful God.
16286,EMPEDOCLES,But he turn'd his beauteous face
16287,EMPEDOCLES,"Haughtily another way,"
16288,EMPEDOCLES,From the grassy sun-warm'd place
16289,EMPEDOCLES,"Where in proud repose he lay,"
16290,EMPEDOCLES,"With one arm over his head,"
16291,EMPEDOCLES,Watching how the whetting sped.
16292,EMPEDOCLES,
16293,EMPEDOCLES,"But aloof, on the lake-strand,"

16295,EMPEDOCLES,Weeping at his master's end;
16296,EMPEDOCLES,For the Faun had been his friend.
16297,EMPEDOCLES,"For he taught him how to sing,"
16298,EMPEDOCLES,And he taught him flute-playing.
16299,EMPEDOCLES,Many a morning had they gone
16300,EMPEDOCLES,"To the glimmering mountain-lakes,"
16301,EMPEDOCLES,And had torn up by the roots
16302,EMPEDOCLES,The tall crested water-reeds
16303,EMPEDOCLES,"With long plumes and soft brown seeds,"
16304,EMPEDOCLES,"And had carved them into flutes,"
16305,EMPEDOCLES,Sitting on a tabled stone
16306,EMPEDOCLES,Where the shoreward ripple breaks.
16307,EMPEDOCLES,And he taught him how to please
16308,EMPEDOCLES,"The red-snooded Phrygian girls,"

16339,EMPEDOCLES,"Thou keepest aloof the profane,"
16340,EMPEDOCLES,But the solitude oppresses thy votary!
16341,EMPEDOCLES,The jars of men reach him not in thy valley--
16342,EMPEDOCLES,But can life reach him?
16343,EMPEDOCLES,Thou fencest him from the multitude--
16344,EMPEDOCLES,Who will fence him from himself?
16345,EMPEDOCLES,"He hears nothing but the cry of the torrents,"
16346,EMPEDOCLES,And the beating of his own heart.
16347,EMPEDOCLES,"The air is thin, the veins swell,"
16348,EMPEDOCLES,The temples tighten and throb there--
16349,EMPEDOCLES,Air! air!
16350,EMPEDOCLES,
16351,EMPEDOCLES,"Take thy bough, set me free from my solitude;"
16352,EMPEDOCLES,I have been enough alone!
16353,EMPEDOCLES,
16354,EMPEDOCLES,Where shall thy votary fly then? back to men?--
16355,EMPEDOCLES,"But they will gladly welcome him once more,"
16356,EMPEDOCLES,"And help him to unbend his too tense thought,"
16357,EMPEDOCLES,"And rid him of the presence of himself,"
16358,EMPEDOCLES,"And keep their friendly chatter at his ear,"
16359,EMPEDOCLES,"And haunt him, till the absence from himself,"
16360,EMPEDOCLES,"That other torment, grow unbearable;"
16361,EMPEDOCLES,"And he will fly to solitude again,"
16362,EMPEDOCLES,"And he will find its air too keen for him,"
16363,EMPEDOCLES,And so change back; and many thousand times
16364,EMPEDOCLES,Be miserably bandied to and fro
16365,EMPEDOCLES,"Like a sea-wave, betwixt the world and thee,"
16366,EMPEDOCLES,"Thou young, implacable God! and only death"
16367,EMPEDOCLES,"Can cut his oscillations short, and so"
16368,EMPEDOCLES,Bring him to poise. There is no other way.
16369,EMPEDOCLES,"And yet what days were those, Parmenides!"
16370,EMPEDOCLES,"When we were young, when we could number friends"
16371,EMPEDOCLES,"In all the Italian cities like ourselves,"
16372,EMPEDOCLES,When with elated hearts we join'd your train.
16373,EMPEDOCLES,Ye Sun-born Virgins! on the road of truth.[32]
16374,EMPEDOCLES,"Then we could still enjoy, then neither thought"
16375,EMPEDOCLES,Nor outward things were closed and dead to us;
16376,EMPEDOCLES,But we received the shock of mighty thoughts
16377,EMPEDOCLES,On simple minds with a pure natural joy;
16378,EMPEDOCLES,"And if the sacred load oppress'd our brain,"
16379,EMPEDOCLES,"We had the power to feel the pressure eased,"
16380,EMPEDOCLES,"The brow unbound, the thoughts flow free again,"
16381,EMPEDOCLES,In the delightful commerce of the world.
16382,EMPEDOCLES,"We had not lost our balance then, nor grown"
16383,EMPEDOCLES,"Thought's slaves, and dead to every natural joy."
16384,EMPEDOCLES,The smallest thing could give us pleasure then--
16385,EMPEDOCLES,"The sports of the country-people,"
16386,EMPEDOCLES,"A flute-note from the woods,"
16387,EMPEDOCLES,Sunset over the sea;
16388,EMPEDOCLES,"Seed-time and harvest,"
16389,EMPEDOCLES,"The reapers in the corn,"
16390,EMPEDOCLES,"The vinedresser in his vineyard,"
16391,EMPEDOCLES,The village-girl at her wheel.
16392,EMPEDOCLES,
16393,EMPEDOCLES,"Fulness of life and power of feeling, ye"
16394,EMPEDOCLES,"Are for the happy, for the souls at ease,"
16395,EMPEDOCLES,Who dwell on a firm basis of content!
16396,EMPEDOCLES,"But he, who has outlived his prosperous days--"
16397,EMPEDOCLES,"But he, whose youth fell on a different world"
16398,EMPEDOCLES,From that on which his exiled age is thrown--
16399,EMPEDOCLES,"Whose mind was fed on other food, was train'd"
16400,EMPEDOCLES,By other rules than are in vogue to-day--
16401,EMPEDOCLES,"Whose habit of thought is fix'd, who will not change,"
16402,EMPEDOCLES,"But, in a world he loves not, must subsist"
16403,EMPEDOCLES,"In ceaseless opposition, be the guard"
16404,EMPEDOCLES,"Of his own breast, fetter'd to what he guards,"
16405,EMPEDOCLES,That the world win no mastery over him--
16406,EMPEDOCLES,"Who has no friend, no fellow left, not one;"
16407,EMPEDOCLES,Who has no minute's breathing space allow'd
16408,EMPEDOCLES,To nurse his dwindling faculty of joy----
16409,EMPEDOCLES,"Joy and the outward world must die to him,"
16410,EMPEDOCLES,As they are dead to me.
16411,EMPEDOCLES,
16412,EMPEDOCLES,"_A long pause, during which_ EMPEDOCLES _remains"
16413,EMPEDOCLES,"motionless, plunged in thought. The night deepens."
16414,EMPEDOCLES,"He moves forward and gazes round him, and"
16415,EMPEDOCLES,proceeds_:--
16416,EMPEDOCLES,
16417,EMPEDOCLES,"And you, ye stars,"
16418,EMPEDOCLES,"Who slowly begin to marshal,"
16419,EMPEDOCLES,"As of old, in the fields of heaven,"
16420,EMPEDOCLES,"Your distant, melancholy lines!"
16421,EMPEDOCLES,"Have you, too, survived yourselves?"
16422,EMPEDOCLES,"Are you, too, what I fear to become?"
16423,EMPEDOCLES,"You, too, once lived;"
16424,EMPEDOCLES,You too moved joyfully
16425,EMPEDOCLES,"Among august companions,"
16426,EMPEDOCLES,"In an older world, peopled by Gods,"
16427,EMPEDOCLES,"In a mightier order,"
16428,EMPEDOCLES,"The radiant, rejoicing, intelligent Sons of Heaven."
16429,EMPEDOCLES,"But now, ye kindle"
16430,EMPEDOCLES,"Your lonely, cold-shining lights,"
16431,EMPEDOCLES,Unwilling lingerers
16432,EMPEDOCLES,"In the heavenly wilderness,"
16433,EMPEDOCLES,"For a younger, ignoble world;"
16434,EMPEDOCLES,"And renew, by necessity,"
16435,EMPEDOCLES,"Night after night your courses,"
16436,EMPEDOCLES,"In echoing, unnear'd silence,"
16437,EMPEDOCLES,Above a race you know not--
16438,EMPEDOCLES,"Uncaring and undelighted,"
16439,EMPEDOCLES,Without friend and without home;
16440,EMPEDOCLES,"Weary like us, though not"
16441,EMPEDOCLES,Weary with our weariness.
16442,EMPEDOCLES,
16443,EMPEDOCLES,"No, no, ye stars! there is no death with you,"
16444,EMPEDOCLES,"No languor, no decay! languor and death,"
16445,EMPEDOCLES,"They are with me, not you! ye are alive--"
16446,EMPEDOCLES,"Ye, and the pure dark ether where ye ride"
16447,EMPEDOCLES,"Brilliant above me! And thou, fiery world,"
16448,EMPEDOCLES,That sapp'st the vitals of this terrible mount
16449,EMPEDOCLES,Upon whose charr'd and quaking crust I stand--
16450,EMPEDOCLES,"Thou, too, brimmest with life!--the sea of cloud,"
16451,EMPEDOCLES,That heaves its white and billowy vapours up
16452,EMPEDOCLES,"To moat this isle of ashes from the world,"
16453,EMPEDOCLES,"Lives; and that other fainter sea, far down,"
16454,EMPEDOCLES,O'er whose lit floor a road of moonbeams leads
16455,EMPEDOCLES,To Etna's Liparëan sister-fires
16456,EMPEDOCLES,And the long dusky line of Italy--
16457,EMPEDOCLES,"That mild and luminous floor of waters lives,"
16458,EMPEDOCLES,"With held-in joy swelling its heart; I only,"
16459,EMPEDOCLES,"Whose spring of hope is dried, whose spirit has fail'd,"
16460,EMPEDOCLES,"I, who have not, like these, in solitude"
16461,EMPEDOCLES,"Maintain'd courage and force, and in myself"
16462,EMPEDOCLES,Nursed an immortal vigour--I alone
16463,EMPEDOCLES,"Am dead to life and joy, therefore I read"
16464,EMPEDOCLES,In all things my own deadness.
16465,EMPEDOCLES,
16466,EMPEDOCLES,_A long silence. He continues_:--
16467,EMPEDOCLES,
16468,EMPEDOCLES,"Oh, that I could glow like this mountain!"
16469,EMPEDOCLES,"Oh, that my heart bounded with the swell of the sea!"
16470,EMPEDOCLES,"Oh, that my soul were full of light as the stars!"
16471,EMPEDOCLES,"Oh, that it brooded over the world like the air!"
16472,EMPEDOCLES,
16473,EMPEDOCLES,"But no, this heart will glow no more; thou art"
16474,EMPEDOCLES,"A living man no more, Empedocles!"
16475,EMPEDOCLES,Nothing but a devouring flame of thought--
16476,EMPEDOCLES,"But a naked, eternally restless mind!"
16477,EMPEDOCLES,
16478,EMPEDOCLES,_After a pause_:--
16479,EMPEDOCLES,
16480,EMPEDOCLES,To the elements it came from
16481,EMPEDOCLES,Everything will return--
16482,EMPEDOCLES,"Our bodies to earth,"
16483,EMPEDOCLES,"Our blood to water,"
16484,EMPEDOCLES,"Heat to fire,"
16485,EMPEDOCLES,Breath to air.
16486,EMPEDOCLES,"They were well born, they will be well entomb'd--"
16487,EMPEDOCLES,But mind?...
16488,EMPEDOCLES,
16489,EMPEDOCLES,And we might gladly share the fruitful stir
16490,EMPEDOCLES,Down in our mother earth's miraculous womb;
16491,EMPEDOCLES,Well would it be
16492,EMPEDOCLES,With what roll'd of us in the stormy main;
16493,EMPEDOCLES,"We might have joy, blent with the all-bathing air,"
16494,EMPEDOCLES,"Or with the nimble, radiant life of fire."
16495,EMPEDOCLES,
16496,EMPEDOCLES,"But mind, but thought--"
16497,EMPEDOCLES,If these have been the master part of us--
16498,EMPEDOCLES,Where will _they_ find their parent element?
16499,EMPEDOCLES,"What will receive _them_, who will call _them_ home?"
16500,EMPEDOCLES,"But we shall still be in them, and they in us,"
16501,EMPEDOCLES,"And we shall be the strangers of the world,"
16502,EMPEDOCLES,"And they will be our lords, as they are now;"
16503,EMPEDOCLES,"And keep us prisoners of our consciousness,"
16504,EMPEDOCLES,And never let us clasp and feel the All
16505,EMPEDOCLES,"But through their forms, and modes, and stifling veils."
16506,EMPEDOCLES,And we shall be unsatisfied as now;
16507,EMPEDOCLES,"And we shall feel the agony of thirst,"
16508,EMPEDOCLES,The ineffable longing for the life of life
16509,EMPEDOCLES,Baffled for ever; and still thought and mind
16510,EMPEDOCLES,"Will hurry us with them on their homeless march,"
16511,EMPEDOCLES,"Over the unallied unopening earth,"
16512,EMPEDOCLES,Over the unrecognising sea; while air
16513,EMPEDOCLES,"Will blow us fiercely back to sea and earth,"
16514,EMPEDOCLES,And fire repel us from its living waves.
16515,EMPEDOCLES,And then we shall unwillingly return
16516,EMPEDOCLES,"Back to this meadow of calamity,"
16517,EMPEDOCLES,"This uncongenial place, this human life;"
16518,EMPEDOCLES,And in our individual human state
16519,EMPEDOCLES,"Go through the sad probation all again,"
16520,EMPEDOCLES,"To see if we will poise our life at last,"
16521,EMPEDOCLES,To see if we will now at last be true
16522,EMPEDOCLES,"To our own only true, deep-buried selves,"
16523,EMPEDOCLES,Being one with which we are one with the whole world;
16524,EMPEDOCLES,Or whether we will once more fall away
16525,EMPEDOCLES,"Into some bondage of the flesh or mind,"
16526,EMPEDOCLES,"Some slough of sense, or some fantastic maze"
16527,EMPEDOCLES,Forged by the imperious lonely thinking-power.
16528,EMPEDOCLES,And each succeeding age in which we are born
16529,EMPEDOCLES,Will have more peril for us than the last;
16530,EMPEDOCLES,"Will goad our senses with a sharper spur,"
16531,EMPEDOCLES,"Will fret our minds to an intenser play,"
16532,EMPEDOCLES,Will make ourselves harder to be discern'd.
16533,EMPEDOCLES,"And we shall struggle awhile, gasp and rebel--"
16534,EMPEDOCLES,"And we shall fly for refuge to past times,"
16535,EMPEDOCLES,"Their soul of unworn youth, their breath of greatness;"
16536,EMPEDOCLES,"And the reality will pluck us back,"
16537,EMPEDOCLES,"Knead us in its hot hand, and change our nature"
16538,EMPEDOCLES,"And we shall feel our powers of effort flag,"
16539,EMPEDOCLES,And rally them for one last fight--and fail;
16540,EMPEDOCLES,"And we shall sink in the impossible strife,"
16541,EMPEDOCLES,And be astray for ever.
16542,EMPEDOCLES,
16543,EMPEDOCLES,Slave of sense
16544,EMPEDOCLES,I have in no wise been;--but slave of thought?...
16545,EMPEDOCLES,"And who can say: I have been always free,"
16546,EMPEDOCLES,Lived ever in the light of my own soul?--
16547,EMPEDOCLES,"I cannot; I have lived in wrath and gloom,"
16548,EMPEDOCLES,"Fierce, disputatious, ever at war with man,"
16549,EMPEDOCLES,"Far from my own soul, far from warmth and light."
16550,EMPEDOCLES,But I have not grown easy in these bonds--
16551,EMPEDOCLES,But I have not denied what bonds these were.
16552,EMPEDOCLES,"Yea, I take myself to witness,"
16553,EMPEDOCLES,"That I have loved no darkness,"
16554,EMPEDOCLES,"Sophisticated no truth,"
16555,EMPEDOCLES,"Nursed no delusion,"
16556,EMPEDOCLES,Allow'd no fear!
16557,EMPEDOCLES,
16558,EMPEDOCLES,"And therefore, O ye elements! I know--"
16559,EMPEDOCLES,Ye know it too--it hath been granted me
16560,EMPEDOCLES,"Not to die wholly, not to be all enslaved."
16561,EMPEDOCLES,I feel it in this hour. The numbing cloud
16562,EMPEDOCLES,"Mounts off my soul; I feel it, I breathe free."
16563,EMPEDOCLES,
16564,EMPEDOCLES,Is it but for a moment?
16565,EMPEDOCLES,"--Ah, boil up, ye vapours!"
16566,EMPEDOCLES,"Leap and roar, thou sea of fire!"
16567,EMPEDOCLES,My soul glows to meet you.
16568,EMPEDOCLES,"Ere it flag, ere the mists"
16569,EMPEDOCLES,Of despondency and gloom
16570,EMPEDOCLES,"Rush over it again,"
16571,EMPEDOCLES,"Receive me, save me!"

16605,EMPEDOCLES,So white through the gloom?

17366,NOTES,
17367,NOTES,The story of Sohrab and Rustum is told in Sir John Malcolm's _History of
17368,NOTES,"Persia_, as follows:--"
17369,NOTES,
17370,NOTES,"""The young Sohrab was the fruit of one of Rustum's early amours. He"
17371,NOTES,"had left his mother, and sought fame under the banners of Afrasiab,"
17372,NOTES,"whose armies he commanded, and soon obtained a renown beyond that"
17373,NOTES,of all contemporary heroes but his father. He had carried death and
17374,NOTES,"dismay into the ranks of the Persians, and had terrified the"
17375,NOTES,"boldest warriors of that country, before Rustum encountered him,"
17376,NOTES,"which at last that hero resolved to do, under a feigned name. They"
17377,NOTES,"met three times. The first time they parted by mutual consent,"
17378,NOTES,"though Sohrab had the advantage; the second, the youth obtained a"
17379,NOTES,"victory, but granted life to his unknown father; the third was"
17380,NOTES,"fatal to Sohrab, who, when writhing in the pangs of death, warned"
17381,NOTES,his conqueror to shun the vengeance that is inspired by parental
17382,NOTES,"woes, and bade him dread the rage of the mighty Rustum, who must"
17383,NOTES,"soon learn that he had slain his son Sohrab. These words, we are"
17384,NOTES,"told, were as death to the aged hero; and when he recovered from a"
17385,NOTES,"trance, he called in despair for proofs of what Sohrab had said."
17386,NOTES,"The afflicted and dying youth tore open his mail, and showed his"
17387,NOTES,father a seal which his mother had placed on his arm when she
17388,NOTES,"discovered to him the secret of his birth, and bade him seek his"
17389,NOTES,father. The sight of his own signet rendered Rustum quite frantic;
17390,NOTES,"he cursed himself, attempting to put an end to his existence, and"
17391,NOTES,was only prevented by the efforts of his expiring son. After
17392,NOTES,"Sohrab's death, he burnt his tents and all his goods, and carried"
17393,NOTES,"the corpse to Seistan, where it was interred; the army of Turan"
17394,NOTES,"was, agreeably to the last request of Sohrab, permitted to cross"
17395,NOTES,the Oxus unmolested. To reconcile us to the improbability of this
17396,NOTES,"tale, we are informed that Rustum could have no idea his son was in"
17397,NOTES,existence. The mother of Sohrab had written to him her child was a
17398,NOTES,"daughter, fearing to lose her darling infant if she revealed the"
17399,NOTES,"truth; and Rustum, as before stated, fought under a feigned name,"
17400,NOTES,"an usage not uncommon in the chivalrous combats of those days.""]"

17579,NOTES,"upon himself the reaping-contest with Lityerses, overcame him, and"

17642,NOTES,"celebrity in France, his own country; and out of France he is almost"
17643,NOTES,"unknown. But the profound inwardness, the austere sincerity, of his"
17644,NOTES,"principal work, _Obermann_, the delicate feeling for nature which it"
17645,NOTES,"exhibits, and the melancholy eloquence of many passages of it, have"
17646,NOTES,attracted and charmed some of the most remarkable spirits of this
17647,NOTES,"century, such as George Sand and Sainte-Beuve, and will probably always"
17648,NOTES,find a certain number of spirits whom they touch and interest.
17649,NOTES,
17650,NOTES,"Senancour was born in 1770. He was educated for the priesthood, and"
17651,NOTES,passed some time in the seminary of St. Sulpice; broke away from the
17652,NOTES,"Seminary and from France itself, and passed some years in Switzerland,"
17653,NOTES,"where he married; returned to France in middle life, and followed"
17654,NOTES,"thenceforward the career of a man of letters, but with hardly any fame"
17655,NOTES,"or success. He died an old man in 1846, desiring that on his grave might"
17656,NOTES,"be placed these words only: _Éternité, deviens mon asile!_"
17657,NOTES,
17658,NOTES,"The influence of Rousseau, and certain affinities with more famous and"
17659,NOTES,"fortunate authors of his own day,--Chateaubriand and Madame de"
17660,NOTES,"Staël,--are everywhere visible in Senancour. But though, like these"
17661,NOTES,"eminent personages, he may be called a sentimental writer, and though"
17662,NOTES,"_Obermann_, a collection of letters from Switzerland treating almost"
17663,NOTES,"entirely of nature and of the human soul, may be called a work of"
17664,NOTES,"sentiment, Senancour has a gravity and severity which distinguish him"
17665,NOTES,from all other writers of the sentimental school. The world is with him
17666,NOTES,in his solitude far less than it is with them; of all writers he is the
17667,NOTES,"most perfectly isolated and the least attitudinising. His chief work,"
17668,NOTES,"too, has a value and power of its own, apart from these merits of its"
17669,NOTES,"author. The stir of all the main forces, by which modern life is and has"
17670,NOTES,"been impelled, lives in the letters of _Obermann_; the dissolving"
17671,NOTES,"agencies of the eighteenth century, the fiery storm of the French"
17672,NOTES,"Revolution, the first faint promise and dawn of that new world which"
17673,NOTES,"our own time is but now more fully bringing to light,--all these are to"
17674,NOTES,"be felt, almost to be touched, there. To me, indeed, it will always seem"
17675,NOTES,that the impressiveness of this production can hardly be rated too high.
17676,NOTES,
17677,NOTES,"Besides _Obermann_ there is one other of Senancour's works which, for"
