83,PREFACE,
84,PREFACE,
85,PREFACE,During the decade between 1879 and 1889 I was engaged in a detailed
86,PREFACE,"study of Wordsworth; and, amongst other things, edited a library edition"
87,PREFACE,"of his Poetical Works in eight volumes, including the ""Prefaces"" and"
88,PREFACE,"""Appendices"" to his Poems, and a few others of his Prose Works, such as"
89,PREFACE,his 'Description of the Scenery of the Lakes in the North of England'.
90,PREFACE,"This edition was published by Mr. Paterson, Edinburgh, at intervals"
91,PREFACE,between the years 1882 and 1886: and it was followed in 1889 by a 'Life
92,PREFACE,"of Wordsworth', in three volumes, which was a continuation of the"
93,PREFACE,previous eight.
94,PREFACE,
95,PREFACE,The present edition is not a reproduction of those eleven volumes of
96,PREFACE,1882-9. It is true that to much of the editorial material included in
97,PREFACE,"the latter--as well as in my 'Memorials of Coleorton', and in 'The"
98,PREFACE,English Lake District as interpreted in the Poems of Wordsworth'--I can
99,PREFACE,add little that is new; but the whole of what was included in these
100,PREFACE,"books has been revised, corrected, and readjusted in this one [1]."
101,PREFACE,'Errata' in the previous volumes are corrected: several thousand new
102,PREFACE,"notes have been added, many of the old ones are entirely recast: the"
103,PREFACE,"changes of text, introduced by Wordsworth into the successive editions"
104,PREFACE,"of his Poems, have all been revised; new readings--derived from many MS."
105,PREFACE,sources--have been added: while the chronological order of the Poems
106,PREFACE,"has, in several instances, been changed, in the light of fresh evidence."
107,PREFACE,
108,PREFACE,The distinctive features of my edition of 1882-6 were stated in the
109,PREFACE,Preface to its first volume. So far as these features remain in the
110,PREFACE,"present edition, they may be repeated as follows:"
111,PREFACE,
112,PREFACE,"FIRST, the Poems are arranged in chronological order of composition, not"
113,PREFACE,of publication. In all the collective editions issued by Wordsworth
114,PREFACE,"during his lifetime, the arrangement of his poems in artificial groups,"
115,PREFACE,based on their leading characteristics--a plan first adopted in
116,PREFACE,1815--was adhered to; although he not unfrequently transferred a poem
117,PREFACE,"from one group to another. Here they are printed, with one or two"
118,PREFACE,"exceptions to be afterwards explained, in the order in which they were"
119,PREFACE,written.
120,PREFACE,
121,PREFACE,"SECOND, the changes of text made by Wordsworth in the successive"
122,PREFACE,"editions of his Poems, are given in footnotes, with the dates of the"
123,PREFACE,changes.
124,PREFACE,
125,PREFACE,"THIRD, suggested changes, written by the Poet on a copy of the"
126,PREFACE,"stereotyped edition of 1836-7--long kept at Rydal Mount, and bought,"
127,PREFACE,"after Mrs. Wordsworth's death, at the sale of a portion of the Library"
128,PREFACE,at the Mount--are given in footnotes.
129,PREFACE,
130,PREFACE,"FOURTH, the Notes dictated by Wordsworth to Miss Isabella Fenwick--a"
131,PREFACE,"dear friend of the Rydal Mount household, and a woman of remarkable"
132,PREFACE,"character and faculty--which tell the story of his Poems, and the"
133,PREFACE,"circumstances under which each was written, are printed in full."
134,PREFACE,
135,PREFACE,"FIFTH, Topographical Notes--explanatory of allusions made by Wordsworth"
136,PREFACE,"to localities in the Lake District of England, to places in Scotland,"
137,PREFACE,"Somersetshire, Yorkshire, the Isle of Man, and others on the Continent"
138,PREFACE,"of Europe--are given, either at the close of the Poem in which the"
139,PREFACE,"allusions occur, or as footnotes to the passages they illustrate."
140,PREFACE,
141,PREFACE,"SIXTH, several complete Poems, and other fragments of verse, not"
142,PREFACE,included in any edition of his Works published during Wordsworth's
143,PREFACE,"lifetime, or since, are printed as an appendix to Volume VIII."
144,PREFACE,
145,PREFACE,"SEVENTH, a new Bibliography of the Poems and Prose Works, and of the"
146,PREFACE,"several editions issued in England and America, from 1793 to 1850, is"
147,PREFACE,added.
148,PREFACE,
149,PREFACE,"EIGHTH, a new Life of the Poet is given."
150,PREFACE,
151,PREFACE,"These features of the edition of 1882-6 are preserved in that of 1896,"
152,PREFACE,and the following are added:
153,PREFACE,
154,PREFACE,"FIRST, The volumes are published, not in library 8vo size, but--as the"
155,PREFACE,"works of every poet should be issued--in one more convenient to handle,"
156,PREFACE,"and to carry. Eight volumes are devoted to the Poetical Works, and among"
157,PREFACE,"them are included those fragments by his sister Dorothy, and others,"
158,PREFACE,which Wordsworth published in his lifetime among his own Poems. They are
159,PREFACE,"printed in the chronological order of composition, so far as that is"
160,PREFACE,known.
161,PREFACE,
162,PREFACE,"SECOND, In the case of each Poem, any Note written by Wordsworth"
163,PREFACE,"himself, as explanatory of it, comes first, and has the initials W. W.,"
164,PREFACE,with the date of its first insertion placed after it. Next follows the
165,PREFACE,"Fenwick Note, within square brackets, thus [ ], and signed I. F.; and,"
166,PREFACE,"afterwards, any editorial note required. When, however, Wordsworth's own"
167,PREFACE,"notes were placed at the end of the Poems, or at the foot of the page,"
168,PREFACE,"his plan is adopted, and the date appended. I should have been glad, had"
169,PREFACE,it been possible--the editors of the twentieth century may note this--to
170,PREFACE,"print Wordsworth's own notes, the Fenwick notes, and the Editor's in"
171,PREFACE,"different type, and in type of a decreasing size; but the idea occurred"
172,PREFACE,"to me too late, i. e. after the first volume had been passed for press."
173,PREFACE,
174,PREFACE,"THIRD, All the Prose Works of Wordsworth are given in full, and follow"
175,PREFACE,"the Poems, in two volumes. The Prose Works were collected by Dr."
176,PREFACE,"Grosart, and published in 1876. Extracts from them have since been"
177,PREFACE,"edited by myself and others: but they will now be issued, like the"
178,PREFACE,"Poems, in chronological order, under their own titles, and with such"
179,PREFACE,notes as seem desirable.
180,PREFACE,
181,PREFACE,"FOURTH, All the Journals written by Dorothy Wordsworth at Alfoxden, Dove"
182,PREFACE,"Cottage, and elsewhere, as well as her record of Tours with her brother"
183,PREFACE,"in Scotland, on the Continent, etc., are published--some of them in"
184,PREFACE,"full, others only in part. An explanation of why any Journal is"
185,PREFACE,curtailed will be found in the editorial note preceding it. Much new
186,PREFACE,material will be found in these Journals.
187,PREFACE,
188,PREFACE,"FIFTH, The Letters of William and Dorothy Wordsworth--with a few from"
189,PREFACE,"Mary and Dora Wordsworth--are arranged chronologically, and published by"
190,PREFACE,"themselves. Hitherto, these letters have been scattered in many"
191,PREFACE,"quarters--in the late Bishop of Lincoln's 'Memoirs' of his uncle, in"
192,PREFACE,"'The Diary, Reminiscences, and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson',"
193,PREFACE,"in the 'Memorials of Coleorton' and my own 'Life' of the Poet, in the"
194,PREFACE,"'Prose Works', in the 'Transactions of the Wordsworth Society', in the"
195,PREFACE,"'Letters of Charles Lamb', in the 'Memorials of Thomas De Quincey', and"
196,PREFACE,"other volumes; but many more, both of Wordsworth's and his sister's,"
197,PREFACE,have never before seen the light. More than a hundred and fifty letters
198,PREFACE,"from Dorothy Wordsworth to Mrs. Clarkson, the wife of the great"
199,PREFACE,"""slave-liberator,"" were sent to me some time ago by Mrs. Arthur"
200,PREFACE,"Tennyson, a relative of Mrs. Clarkson; and I have recently seen and been"
201,PREFACE,"allowed to copy, Wordsworth's letters to his early friend Francis"
202,PREFACE,"Wrangham, through the kindness of their late owner, Mr. Mackay of The"
203,PREFACE,"Grange, Trowbridge. Many other letters of great interest have recently"
204,PREFACE,reached me.
205,PREFACE,
206,PREFACE,"SIXTH, In addition to a new Bibliography, and a Chronological Table of"
207,PREFACE,"the Poems, and the Prose Works, a Bibliography of Wordsworth Criticism"
208,PREFACE,"is appended. It includes most of the articles on the Poet, and notices"
209,PREFACE,"of his Works, which have appeared in Great Britain, America, and the"
210,PREFACE,Continent of Europe. Under this head I have specially to thank Mrs.
211,PREFACE,"Henry A. St. John of Ithaca, N.Y., a devoted Transatlantic"
212,PREFACE,"Wordsworthian, who has perhaps done more than any one--since Henry"
213,PREFACE,Reed--to promote the study of her favourite poet in America. Mrs. St.
214,PREFACE,"John's Wordsworth collection is unique, and her knowledge and enthusiasm"
215,PREFACE,are as great as her industry has been. Professor E. Legouis of the
216,PREFACE,University of Lyons--who wrote an interesting book on Wordsworth's
217,PREFACE,"friend, 'Le Général Michel Beaupuy' (1891)--has sent me material from"
218,PREFACE,"France, which will be found in its proper place. Frau Professor Gothein"
219,PREFACE,"of Bonn, who has translated many of Wordsworth's poems into German, and"
220,PREFACE,"written his life, 'William Wordsworth: sein Leben, seine Werke, seine"
221,PREFACE,"Zeitgenossen', (1893), has similarly helped me in reference to German"
222,PREFACE,criticism.
223,PREFACE,
224,PREFACE,"SEVENTH, As the Poet's Letters, and his sister's Journals, will appear"
225,PREFACE,"in earlier volumes, the new 'Life of Wordsworth' will be much shorter"
226,PREFACE,"than that which was published in 1889, in three volumes 8vo. It will not"
227,PREFACE,exceed a single volume.
228,PREFACE,
229,PREFACE,"EIGHTH, In the edition of 1882-6, each volume contained an etching of a"
230,PREFACE,locality associated with Wordsworth. The drawings were made by John
231,PREFACE,"M'Whirter, R.A., in water-colour; and they were afterwards etched by Mr."
232,PREFACE,C. O. Murray. One portrait by Haydon was prefixed to the first volume of
233,PREFACE,"the 'Life'. In each volume of this edition--Poems, Prose Works,"
234,PREFACE,"Journals, Letters, and Life--there will be a new portrait, either of the"
235,PREFACE,"poet, or his wife, or sister, or daughter; and also a small vignette of"
236,PREFACE,"a place associated with, or memorialised by Wordsworth in some way. The"
237,PREFACE,following will be the arrangement.

295,THE LIFE.,"many others, will be described in detail in a subsequent volume."
296,THE LIFE.,
297,THE LIFE.,In all editorial notes the titles given by Wordsworth to his Poems are
298,THE LIFE.,"invariably printed in italics, not with inverted commas before and"
299,THE LIFE.,"after, as Wordsworth himself so often printed them: and when he gave no"
300,THE LIFE.,"title to a poem, its first line will be invariably placed within"
301,THE LIFE.,"inverted commas. This plan of using Italics, and not Roman letters,"
302,THE LIFE.,"applies also to the title of any book referred to by Wordsworth, or by"
303,THE LIFE.,"his sister in her Journals. Whether they put the title in italics, or"
304,THE LIFE.,"within commas, it is always italicised in this edition."
305,THE LIFE.,
306,THE LIFE.,A subsidiary matter such as this becomes important when one finds that
307,THE LIFE.,"many editors of parts of the Works of Wordsworth, or of Selections from"
308,THE LIFE.,"them, have invented titles of their own; and have sent their volumes to"
309,THE LIFE.,press without the slightest indication to their readers that the titles
310,THE LIFE.,were not Wordsworth's; mixing up their own notion of what best described
311,THE LIFE.,"the contents of the Poem, or the Letter, with those of the writer. Some"
312,THE LIFE.,"have suppressed Wordsworth's, and put their own title in its place!"
313,THE LIFE.,Others have contented themselves (more modestly) with inventing a title
314,THE LIFE.,when Wordsworth gave none. I do not object to these titles in
315,THE LIFE.,"themselves. Several, such as those by Archbishop Trench, are suggestive"
316,THE LIFE.,and valuable. What I object to is that any editor--no matter who--should
317,THE LIFE.,"mingle his own titles with those of the Poet, and give no indication to"
318,THE LIFE.,the reader as to which is which. Dr. Grosart has been so devoted a
319,THE LIFE.,"student of Wordsworth, and we owe him so much, that one regrets to find"
320,THE LIFE.,"in ""The Prose Works of Wordsworth"" (1876) the following title given to"
321,THE LIFE.,"his letter to the Bishop of Llandaff, 'Apology for the French"
322,THE LIFE.,Revolution'. It is interesting to know that Dr. Grosart thought this a
323,THE LIFE.,useful description of the letter: but a clear indication should have
324,THE LIFE.,"been given that it was not Wordsworth's. It is true that, in the general"
325,THE LIFE.,"preface to his volumes, Dr. Grosart takes upon himself the"
326,THE LIFE.,responsibility for this title; but it should not have been printed as
327,THE LIFE.,"the title in chief, or as the headline to the text. Similarly, with the"
328,THE LIFE.,titles of the second and third of the three 'Essays on Epitaphs'.
329,THE LIFE.,
330,THE LIFE.,"As students of Wordsworth know, he issued a volume in 1838 containing"
331,THE LIFE.,"all his sonnets then written; and, at the close of that edition, he"
332,THE LIFE.,"added, ""The six Sonnets annexed were composed as this Volume was going"
333,THE LIFE.,"through the Press, but too late for insertion in the class of"
334,THE LIFE.,"miscellaneous ones to which they belong."" In 1884, Archbishop Trench"
335,THE LIFE.,"edited the sonnets, with an admirable introductory ""Essay on the History"
336,THE LIFE.,"of the English Sonnet""; but, while Wordsworth gave no title to the 3rd"
337,THE LIFE.,"and the 4th of the six, ""composed as the Volume was going through the"
338,THE LIFE.,"Press,""--either in his edition of 1838, 'or in any subsequent issue' of"
339,THE LIFE.,"his Poems--his editor did so. He gave what are really excellent titles,"
340,THE LIFE.,but he does not tell us that they are his own! He calls them
341,THE LIFE.,"respectively 'The Thrush at Twilight', and 'The Thrush at Dawn'."
342,THE LIFE.,"Possibly Wordsworth would have approved of both of those titles: but,"
343,THE LIFE.,"that they are not his, should have been indicated."
344,THE LIFE.,
345,THE LIFE.,"I do not think it wise, from an editorial point of view, even to print"
346,THE LIFE.,"in a ""Chronological Table""--as Professor Dowden has done, in his"
347,THE LIFE.,"admirable Aldine edition--titles which were not Wordsworth's, without"
348,THE LIFE.,"some indication to that effect. But, in the case of Selections from"
349,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth--such as those of Mr. Hawes Turner, and Mr. A. J."
350,THE LIFE.,"Symington,--every one must feel that the editor should have informed his"
351,THE LIFE.,"readers 'when' the title was Wordsworth's, and 'when' it was his own"
352,THE LIFE.,coinage. In the case of a much greater man--and one of Wordsworth's most
353,THE LIFE.,"illustrious successors in the great hierarchy of English poesy, Matthew"
354,THE LIFE.,"Arnold--it may be asked why should he have put 'Margaret, or the Ruined"
355,THE LIFE.,"Cottage', as the title of a poem written in 1795-7, when Wordsworth"
356,THE LIFE.,never once published it under that name? It was an extract from the
357,THE LIFE.,"first book of 'The Excursion'--written, it is true, in these early"
358,THE LIFE.,"years,--but only issued as part of the latter poem, first published in"
359,THE LIFE.,1814.
360,THE LIFE.,
361,THE LIFE.,"The question of the number, the character, and the length of the Notes,"
362,THE LIFE.,"which a wise editor should append to the works of a great poet, (or to"
363,THE LIFE.,"any classic), is perhaps still 'sub judice'. My own opinion is that, in"
364,THE LIFE.,"all editorial work, the notes should be illustrative rather than"
365,THE LIFE.,"critical; and that they should only bring out those points, which the"
366,THE LIFE.,"ordinary reader of the text would not readily understand, if the poems"
367,THE LIFE.,"were not annotated. For this reason, topographical, historical, and"
368,THE LIFE.,antiquarian notes are almost essential. The Notes which Wordsworth
369,THE LIFE.,"himself wrote to his Poems, are of unequal length and merit. It was"
370,THE LIFE.,perhaps necessary for him to write--at all events it is easy to
371,THE LIFE.,"understand, and to sympathise with, his writing--the long note on the"
372,THE LIFE.,"revered parson of the Duddon Valley, the Rev. Robert Walker, who will be"
373,THE LIFE.,"remembered for many generations as the ""Wonderful Walker."" The Poet's"
374,THE LIFE.,"editors have also been occasionally led to add digressive notes, to"
375,THE LIFE.,"clear up points which had been left by himself either dubious, or"
376,THE LIFE.,obscure. I must plead guilty to the charge of doing so: e.g. the
377,THE LIFE.,"identification of ""The Muccawiss"" (see 'The Excursion', book iii. l."
378,THE LIFE.,953) with the Whip-poor-Will involved a great deal of laborious
379,THE LIFE.,"correspondence years ago. It was a question of real difficulty; and,"
380,THE LIFE.,"although the result reached could now be put into two or three lines, I"
381,THE LIFE.,"have thought it desirable that the opinions of those who wrote about it,"
382,THE LIFE.,"and helped toward the solution, should be recorded. What I print is only"
383,THE LIFE.,a small part of the correspondence that took place.
384,THE LIFE.,
385,THE LIFE.,"On the other hand, it would be quite out of place, in a note to the"
386,THE LIFE.,"famous passage in the 4th book of 'The Excursion', beginning"
387,THE LIFE.,
388,THE LIFE.,... I have seen
389,THE LIFE.,A curious child applying to his ear
390,THE LIFE.,
391,THE LIFE.,to enter on a discussion as to the extent of Wordsworth's debt--if
392,THE LIFE.,any--to the author of 'Gebir'. It is quite sufficient to print the
393,THE LIFE.,relative passage from Landor's poem at the foot of the page.
394,THE LIFE.,
395,THE LIFE.,All the Notes written by Wordsworth himself in his numerous editions
396,THE LIFE.,"will be found in this one, with the date of their first appearance"
397,THE LIFE.,"added. Slight textual changes, however, or casual 'addenda', are not"
398,THE LIFE.,"indicated, unless they are sufficiently important. Changes in the text"
399,THE LIFE.,"of notes have not the same importance to posterity, as changes in the"
400,THE LIFE.,"text of poems. In the preface to the Prose Works, reference will be made"
401,THE LIFE.,to Wordsworth's alterations of his text. At present I refer only to his
402,THE LIFE.,"own notes to his Poems. When they were written as footnotes to the page,"
403,THE LIFE.,they remain footnotes still. When they were placed by him as prefaces to
404,THE LIFE.,"his Poems, they retain that place in this edition; but when they were"
405,THE LIFE.,"appendix notes--as e.g. in the early editions of ""Lyrical Ballads""--they"
406,THE LIFE.,"are now made footnotes to the Poems they illustrate. In such a case,"
407,THE LIFE.,"however, as the elaborate note to 'The Excursion', containing a reprint"
408,THE LIFE.,"of the 'Essay upon Epitaphs'--originally contributed to ""The Friend""--it"
409,THE LIFE.,"is transferred to the Prose Works, to which it belongs by priority of"
410,THE LIFE.,"date; and, as it would be inexpedient to print it twice over, it is"
411,THE LIFE.,omitted from the notes to 'The Excursion'.
412,THE LIFE.,
413,THE LIFE.,"As to the place which Notes to a poet's works should occupy, there is no"
414,THE LIFE.,"doubt that numerous and lengthy ones--however valuable, or even"
415,THE LIFE.,"necessary, by way of illustration,--disfigure the printed page; and some"
416,THE LIFE.,prefer that they should be thrown all together at the end of each
417,THE LIFE.,"volume, or at the close of a series; such as--in Wordsworth's case--""The"
418,THE LIFE.,"River Duddon,"" ""Ecclesiastical Sonnets,"" 'The Prelude', 'The White Doe"
419,THE LIFE.,"of Rylstone', etc. I do not think, however, that many care to turn"
420,THE LIFE.,"repeatedly to the close of a series of poems, or the end of a volume, to"
421,THE LIFE.,"find an explanatory note, helped only by an index number, and when"
422,THE LIFE.,perhaps even that does not meet his eye at the foot of the page. I do
423,THE LIFE.,not find that even ardent Wordsworth students like to search for notes
424,THE LIFE.,"in ""appendices""; and perhaps the more ardent they are the less desirable"
425,THE LIFE.,"is it for them thus ""to hunt the waterfalls."""
426,THE LIFE.,
427,THE LIFE.,I have the greatest admiration for the work which Professor Dowden has
428,THE LIFE.,"done in his edition of Wordsworth; but the 'plan' which he has followed,"
429,THE LIFE.,"in his Aldine edition, of giving not only the Fenwick Notes, but all the"
430,THE LIFE.,"changes of text introduced by Wordsworth into his successive editions,"
431,THE LIFE.,in additional editorial notes at the end of each volume--to understand
432,THE LIFE.,"which the reader must turn the pages repeatedly, from text to note and"
433,THE LIFE.,"note to text, forwards and backwards, at times distractingly--is for"
434,THE LIFE.,practical purposes almost unworkable. The reader who examines Notes
435,THE LIFE.,"'critically' is ever ""one among a thousand,"" even if they are printed at"
436,THE LIFE.,"the foot of the page, and meet the eye readily. If they are consigned to"
437,THE LIFE.,"the realm of 'addenda' they will be read by very few, and studied by"
438,THE LIFE.,fewer.
439,THE LIFE.,
440,THE LIFE.,"To those who object to Notes being ""thrust into view"" (as it must be"
441,THE LIFE.,admitted that they are in this edition)--because it disturbs the
442,THE LIFE.,"pleasure of the reader who cares for the poetry of Wordsworth, and for"
443,THE LIFE.,the poetry alone--I may ask how many persons have read the Fenwick
444,THE LIFE.,"Notes, given together in a series, and mixed up heterogeneously with"
445,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth's own Notes to his poems, in comparison with those who have"
446,THE LIFE.,read and enjoyed them in the editions of 1857 and 1863? Professor Dowden
447,THE LIFE.,justifies his plan of relegating the Fenwick and other notes to the end
448,THE LIFE.,"of each volume of his edition, on the ground that students of the Poet"
449,THE LIFE.,'must' take the trouble of hunting to and fro for such things. I greatly
450,THE LIFE.,doubt if many who have read and profited--for they could not but
451,THE LIFE.,"profit--by a perusal of Professor Dowden's work, 'have' taken that"
452,THE LIFE.,"trouble, or that future readers of the Aldine edition will take it."
453,THE LIFE.,
454,THE LIFE.,"To refer, somewhat more in detail, to the features of this edition."
455,THE LIFE.,
456,THE LIFE.,
457,THE LIFE.,FIRST. As to the 'Chronological Order' of the Poems.
458,THE LIFE.,
459,THE LIFE.,The chief advantage of a chronological arrangement of the Works of any
460,THE LIFE.,author--and especially of a poet who himself adopted a different
461,THE LIFE.,"plan--is that it shows us, as nothing else can do, the growth of his own"
462,THE LIFE.,"mind, the progressive development of his genius and imaginative power."
463,THE LIFE.,"By such a redistribution of what he wrote we can trace the rise, the"
464,THE LIFE.,"culmination, and also--it may be--the decline and fall of his genius."
465,THE LIFE.,Wordsworth's own arrangement--first adopted in the edition of 1815--was
466,THE LIFE.,"designed by him, with the view of bringing together, in separate"
467,THE LIFE.,"classes, those Poems which referred to the same (or similar) subjects,"
468,THE LIFE.,or which were supposed to be the product of the same (or a similar)
469,THE LIFE.,"faculty, irrespective of the date of composition. Thus one group was"
470,THE LIFE.,"entitled ""Poems of the Fancy,"" another ""Poems of the Imagination,"" a"
471,THE LIFE.,"third ""Poems proceeding from Sentiment and Reflection,"" a fourth"
472,THE LIFE.,"""Epitaphs and Elegiac Pieces,"" again ""Poems on the Naming of Places,"""
473,THE LIFE.,"""Memorials of Tours,"" ""Ecclesiastical Sonnets,"" ""Miscellaneous Sonnets,"""
474,THE LIFE.,"etc. The principle which guided him in this was obvious enough. It was,"
475,THE LIFE.,"in some respects, a most natural arrangement; and, in now adopting a"
476,THE LIFE.,"chronological order, the groups, which he constructed with so much care,"
477,THE LIFE.,are broken up. Probably every author would attach more importance to a
478,THE LIFE.,"classification of his Works, which brought them together under"
479,THE LIFE.,"appropriate headings, irrespective of date, than to a method of"
480,THE LIFE.,arrangement which exhibited the growth of his own mind; and it may be
481,THE LIFE.,taken for granted that posterity would not think highly of any author
482,THE LIFE.,who attached special value to this latter element. None the less
483,THE LIFE.,"posterity may wish to trace the gradual development of genius, in the"
484,THE LIFE.,"imaginative writers of the past, by the help of such a subsequent"
485,THE LIFE.,rearrangement of their Works.
486,THE LIFE.,
487,THE LIFE.,"There are difficulties, however, in the way of such a rearrangement,"
488,THE LIFE.,"some of which, in Wordsworth's case, cannot be entirely surmounted. In"
489,THE LIFE.,"the case of itinerary Sonnets, referring to the same subject, the"
490,THE LIFE.,dismemberment of a series--carefully arranged by their author--seems to
491,THE LIFE.,be specially unnatural. But Wordsworth himself sanctioned the principle.
492,THE LIFE.,If there was a fitness in collecting all his sonnets in one volume in
493,THE LIFE.,"the year 1838, out of deference to the wishes of his friends, in order"
494,THE LIFE.,"that these poems might be ""brought under the eye at once""--thus removing"
495,THE LIFE.,"them from their original places, in his collected works--it seems"
496,THE LIFE.,"equally fitting now to rearrange them chronologically, as far as it is"
497,THE LIFE.,possible to do so. It will be seen that it is not always possible.
498,THE LIFE.,
499,THE LIFE.,"Then, there is the case of two Poems following each other, in"
500,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth's own arrangement, by natural affinity; such as the 'Epistle"
501,THE LIFE.,"to Sir George Beaumont', written in 1811, which in almost all existing"
502,THE LIFE.,"editions is followed by the Poem written in 1841, and entitled, 'Upon"
503,THE LIFE.,"perusing the foregoing Epistle thirty years after its composition'; or,"
504,THE LIFE.,"the dedication to 'The White Doe of Rylstone', written in April 1815,"
505,THE LIFE.,while the Poem itself was written in 1807. To separate these Poems seems
506,THE LIFE.,"unnatural; and, as it would be inadmissible to print the second of the"
507,THE LIFE.,"two twice over--once as a sequel to the first poem, and again in its"
508,THE LIFE.,chronological place--adherence to the latter plan has its obvious
509,THE LIFE.,disadvantage in the case of these poems.
510,THE LIFE.,
511,THE LIFE.,"Mr. Aubrey de Vere is very desirous that I should arrange all the ""Poems"
512,THE LIFE.,"dedicated to National Independence and Liberty"" together in series, as"
513,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth left them, ""on the principle that, though the order of"
514,THE LIFE.,"publication should as a rule be the order of composition in poetry, all"
515,THE LIFE.,"rules require, as well as admit of, exceptions."" As I have the greatest"
516,THE LIFE.,"respect for the judgment of such an authority as Mr. de Vere, I may"
517,THE LIFE.,explain that I only venture to differ from him because there are
518,THE LIFE.,"seventy-four Poems--including the sonnets and odes--in this series, and"
519,THE LIFE.,"because they cover a period ranging from 1802 to 1815. I am glad,"
520,THE LIFE.,"however, that many of these sonnets can be printed together, especially"
521,THE LIFE.,the earlier ones of 1802.
522,THE LIFE.,
523,THE LIFE.,"After carefully weighing every consideration, it has seemed to me"
524,THE LIFE.,desirable to adopt the chronological arrangement in this particular
525,THE LIFE.,edition; in which an attempt is made to trace the growth of Wordsworth's
526,THE LIFE.,"genius, as it is unfolded in his successive works. His own arrangement"
527,THE LIFE.,of his Poems will always possess a special interest and value; and it is
528,THE LIFE.,not likely ever to be entirely superseded in subsequent issues of his
529,THE LIFE.,Works. The editors and publishers of the future may possibly prefer it
530,THE LIFE.,"to the plan now adopted, and it will commend itself to many readers from"
531,THE LIFE.,the mere fact that 'it was Wordsworth's own'; but in an edition such as
532,THE LIFE.,the present--which is meant to supply material for the study of the Poet
533,THE LIFE.,"to those who may not possess, or have access to, the earlier and rarer"
534,THE LIFE.,editions--no method of arrangement can be so good as the chronological
535,THE LIFE.,"one. Its importance will be obvious after several volumes are published,"
536,THE LIFE.,when the point referred to above--viz. the evolution of the poet's
537,THE LIFE.,"genius--will be shown by the very sequence of the subjects chosen, and"
538,THE LIFE.,their method of treatment from year to year.
539,THE LIFE.,
540,THE LIFE.,The date of the composition of Wordsworth's Poems cannot always be
541,THE LIFE.,"ascertained with accuracy: and to get at the chronological order, it is"
542,THE LIFE.,"not sufficient to take up his earlier volumes, and thereafter to note"
543,THE LIFE.,the additions made in subsequent ones. We now know (approximately) when
544,THE LIFE.,"each poem was first published; although, in some instances, they"
545,THE LIFE.,"appeared in newspapers and magazines, and in many cases publication was"
546,THE LIFE.,"long after the date of composition. For example, 'Guilt and Sorrow; or,"
547,THE LIFE.,Incidents upon Salisbury Plain'--written in the years 1791-94--was not
548,THE LIFE.,"published 'in extenso' till 1842. The tragedy of 'The Borderers',"
549,THE LIFE.,"composed in 1795-96, was also first published in 1842. 'The"
550,THE LIFE.,"Prelude'--""commenced in the beginning of the year 1799, and completed in"
551,THE LIFE.,"the summer of 1805""--was published posthumously in 1850: and some"
552,THE LIFE.,"unpublished poems--both ""of early and late years""--were first issued in"
553,THE LIFE.,"1886. A poem was frequently kept back, from some doubt as to its worth,"
554,THE LIFE.,or from a wish to alter and amend it. Of the five or six hundred sonnets
555,THE LIFE.,"that he wrote, Wordsworth said ""Most of them were frequently re-touched;"
556,THE LIFE.,"and, not a few, laboriously."" Some poems were almost entirely recast;"
557,THE LIFE.,and occasionally fugitive verses were withheld from publication for a
558,THE LIFE.,"time, because it was hoped that they would subsequently form part of a"
559,THE LIFE.,larger whole.
560,THE LIFE.,
561,THE LIFE.,"In the case of many of the poems, we are left to conjecture the date of"
562,THE LIFE.,"composition, although we are seldom without some clue to it. The Fenwick"
563,THE LIFE.,Notes are a great assistance in determining the chronology. These
564,THE LIFE.,notes--which will be afterwards more fully referred to--were dictated by
565,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth to Miss Fenwick in the year 1843; but, at that time, his"
566,THE LIFE.,memory could not be absolutely trusted as to dates; and in some
567,THE LIFE.,"instances we know it to have been at fault. For example, he said of 'The"
568,THE LIFE.,"Old Cumberland Beggar' that it was ""written at Racedown and Alfoxden in"
569,THE LIFE.,"my twenty-third year."" Now, he went to Racedown in the autumn of 1795,"
570,THE LIFE.,"when he was twenty-five years old; and to Alfoxden, in the autumn of"
571,THE LIFE.,"1797, when twenty-seven. Again, the poem 'Rural Architecture' is put"
572,THE LIFE.,"down in the Fenwick note as ""written at Townend in 1801""; but it had"
573,THE LIFE.,"been published in 1800, in the second edition of ""Lyrical Ballads."""
574,THE LIFE.,"Similarly Wordsworth gave the dates ""1801 or 1802"" for 'The Reverie of"
575,THE LIFE.,"Poor Susan', which had also appeared in ""Lyrical Ballads,"" 1800."
576,THE LIFE.,
577,THE LIFE.,Wordsworth's memory was not always to be trusted even when he was
578,THE LIFE.,"speaking of a group of his own Poems. For example, in the edition of"
579,THE LIFE.,"1807, there is a short series described thus, ""Poems, composed during a"
580,THE LIFE.,"tour, chiefly on foot."" They are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Now, one would"
581,THE LIFE.,"naturally suppose that all the poems, in this set of five, were composed"
582,THE LIFE.,"during the same pedestrian tour, and that they all referred to the same"
583,THE LIFE.,"time. But the series contains 'Alice Fell' (1802), 'Beggars' (1802), 'To"
584,THE LIFE.,"a Sky-Lark' (1805), and 'Resolution and Independence' (1802)."
585,THE LIFE.,
586,THE LIFE.,Much more valuable than the Fenwick notes--for a certain portion of
587,THE LIFE.,Wordsworth's life--is his sister Dorothy's Journal. The mistakes in the
588,THE LIFE.,former can frequently be corrected from the minutely kept diary of those
589,THE LIFE.,"early years, when the brother and sister lived together at Grasmere. The"
590,THE LIFE.,"whole of that Journal, so far as it is desirable to print it for"
591,THE LIFE.,"posterity, will be given in a subsequent volume."
592,THE LIFE.,
593,THE LIFE.,"Long before the publication of the Fenwick notes, Wordsworth himself"
594,THE LIFE.,supplied some data for a chronological arrangement of his Works. In the
595,THE LIFE.,"table of contents, prefixed to the first collected edition of 1815, in"
596,THE LIFE.,"two volumes,--and also to the second collected edition of 1820, in four"
597,THE LIFE.,"volumes,--there are two parallel columns: one giving the date of"
598,THE LIFE.,"composition, and the other that of publication. There are numerous"
599,THE LIFE.,"blanks in the former column, which was the only important one; as the"
600,THE LIFE.,year of publication could be ascertained from the editions themselves.
601,THE LIFE.,"Sometimes the date is given vaguely; as in the case of the ""Sonnets"
602,THE LIFE.,"dedicated to Liberty,"" where the note runs, ""from the year 1807 to"
603,THE LIFE.,"1813."" At other times, the entry of the year of publication is"
604,THE LIFE.,"inaccurate; for example, the 'Inscription for the spot where the"
605,THE LIFE.,"Hermitage stood on St. Herbert's Island, Derwentwater', is put down as"
606,THE LIFE.,belonging to the year 1807; but this poem does not occur in the volumes
607,THE LIFE.,"of 1807, but in the second volume of ""Lyrical Ballads"" (1800). It will"
608,THE LIFE.,thus be seen that it is only by comparing Wordsworth's own lists of the
609,THE LIFE.,"years to which his Poems belong, with the contents of the several"
610,THE LIFE.,"editions of his Works, with the Fenwick Notes, and with his sister's"
611,THE LIFE.,"Journal, that we can approximately reconstruct the true chronology. To"
612,THE LIFE.,these sources of information must be added the internal evidence of the
613,THE LIFE.,"Poems themselves, incidental references in letters to friends, and stray"
614,THE LIFE.,hints gathered from various quarters.
615,THE LIFE.,
616,THE LIFE.,Many new sources of information as to the date of the composition of the
617,THE LIFE.,"Poems became known to me during the publication of my previous edition,"
618,THE LIFE.,and after its issue; the most important being the Journals of Dorothy
619,THE LIFE.,Wordsworth. These discoveries showed that my chronological table of
620,THE LIFE.,"1882--although then, relatively, ""up to date""--was incomplete. The"
621,THE LIFE.,tables constructed by Mr. Tutin and by Professor Dowden are both more
622,THE LIFE.,accurate than it was. It is impossible to attain to finality in such a
623,THE LIFE.,"matter; and several facts, afterwards discovered, and mentioned in the"
624,THE LIFE.,"later volumes of my previous edition, have been used against the"
625,THE LIFE.,conclusions come to in the earlier ones. I have thus supplied the
626,THE LIFE.,feathers for a few subsequent critical arrows. The shots have not been
627,THE LIFE.,"unkindly ones; and I am glad of the result, viz. that our knowledge of"
628,THE LIFE.,the dates--both as to the composition and first publication of the poems
629,THE LIFE.,--is now much more exact than before. When a conjectural one is given in
630,THE LIFE.,"this edition, the fact is always mentioned."
631,THE LIFE.,
632,THE LIFE.,"This chronological method of arrangement, however, has its limits. It is"
633,THE LIFE.,"not possible always to adopt it: nor is it invariably 'necessary', even"
634,THE LIFE.,in order to obtain a true view of the growth of Wordsworth's mind. In
635,THE LIFE.,this--as in so many other things--wisdom lies in the avoidance of
636,THE LIFE.,extremes; the extreme of rigid fidelity to the order of time on the one
637,THE LIFE.,"hand, and the extreme of an irrational departure from it on the other."
638,THE LIFE.,While an effort has been made to discover the exact order of the
639,THE LIFE.,"composition of the poems--and this is shown, not only in the"
640,THE LIFE.,"Chronological Table, but at the beginning of each separate poem--it has"
641,THE LIFE.,been considered expedient to depart from that order in printing some of
642,THE LIFE.,"the poems. In certain cases a poem was begun and laid aside, and again"
643,THE LIFE.,resumed at intervals; and it is difficult to know to what year the
644,THE LIFE.,larger part of it should be assigned. When we know the date at which a
645,THE LIFE.,"poem was commenced, and that it was finished ""long afterwards,"" but have"
646,THE LIFE.,"no clue as to the year, it is assigned to the year in which it was"
647,THE LIFE.,"begun. For example, the 'Address to Kilchurn Castle' was begun in 1803,"
648,THE LIFE.,but only the first three lines were written then. Wordsworth tells us
649,THE LIFE.,"that ""the rest was added many years after,"" but when we know not; and"
650,THE LIFE.,"the poem was not published till 1827. In such a case, it is placed in"
651,THE LIFE.,"this edition as if it belonged chronologically to 1803, and retains its"
652,THE LIFE.,place in the series of Poems which memorialise the Tour in Scotland of
653,THE LIFE.,"that year. On a similar principle, 'The Highland Girl' is placed in the"
654,THE LIFE.,"same series; although Dorothy Wordsworth tells us, in her Journal of the"
655,THE LIFE.,"Tour, that it was composed ""not long after our return from Scotland"";"
656,THE LIFE.,and 'Glen Almain'--although written afterwards at Rydal--retains its
657,THE LIFE.,published place in the memorial group. Again the 'Departure from the
658,THE LIFE.,"Vale of Grasmere, August 1803', is prefixed to the same series; although"
659,THE LIFE.,"it was not written till 1811, and first published in 1827. To give"
660,THE LIFE.,"symmetry to such a Series, it is necessary to depart from the exact"
661,THE LIFE.,chronological order--the departure being duly indicated.
662,THE LIFE.,
663,THE LIFE.,On the same principle I have followed the 'Address to the Scholars of
664,THE LIFE.,"the Village School of----', by its natural sequel--'By the Side of the"
665,THE LIFE.,"Grave some Years after', the date of the composition of which is"
666,THE LIFE.,unknown: and the 'Epistle to Sir George Beaumont' (1811) is followed by
667,THE LIFE.,"the later Lines, to which Wordsworth gave the most prosaic title--he was"
668,THE LIFE.,often infelicitous in his titles--'Upon perusing the foregoing Epistle
669,THE LIFE.,thirty years after its composition'. A like remark applies to the poem
670,THE LIFE.,"'Beggars', which is followed by its own 'Sequel', although the order of"
671,THE LIFE.,"date is disturbed; while all the ""Epitaphs,"" translated from Chiabrera,"
672,THE LIFE.,are printed together.
673,THE LIFE.,
674,THE LIFE.,It is manifestly appropriate that the poems belonging to a series--such
675,THE LIFE.,"as the ""Ecclesiastical Sonnets,"" or those referring to the"
676,THE LIFE.,"""Duddon""--should be brought together, as Wordsworth finally arranged"
677,THE LIFE.,them; even although we may be aware that some of them were written
678,THE LIFE.,"subsequently, and placed in the middle of the series. The sonnets"
679,THE LIFE.,"referring to ""Aspects of Christianity in America""--inserted in the 1845"
680,THE LIFE.,and 1849-50 editions of the collected Works--are found in no previous
681,THE LIFE.,"edition or version of the ""Ecclesiastical Sonnets."" These, along with"
682,THE LIFE.,"some others on the Offices of the English Liturgy, were suggested to"
683,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth by an American prelate, Bishop Doane, and by Professor Henry"
684,THE LIFE.,Reed; [2] but we do not know in what year they were written. The
685,THE LIFE.,"""Ecclesiastical Sonnets""--first called ""Ecclesiastical Sketches""--were"
686,THE LIFE.,written in the years 1820-22. The above additions to them appeared
687,THE LIFE.,twenty-five years afterwards; but they ought manifestly to retain their
688,THE LIFE.,"place, as arranged by Wordsworth in the edition of 1845. The case is"
689,THE LIFE.,"much the same with regard to the ""Duddon Sonnets."" They were first"
690,THE LIFE.,published in 1820: but No. xiv. beginning:
691,THE LIFE.,
692,THE LIFE.,"O mountain Stream! the Shepherd and his Cot,"
693,THE LIFE.,
694,THE LIFE.,"was written in the year 1806, and appears in the edition of 1807. This"
695,THE LIFE.,"sonnet will be printed in the series to which it belongs, and not in its"
696,THE LIFE.,chronological place. I think it would be equally unjust to remove it
697,THE LIFE.,from the group--in which it helps to form a unity--and to print it twice
698,THE LIFE.,"over. [3] On the other hand, the series of ""Poems composed during a Tour"
699,THE LIFE.,"in Scotland, and on the English Border, in the Autumn of 1831""--and"
700,THE LIFE.,"first published in the year 1835, in the volume entitled ""Yarrow"
701,THE LIFE.,"Revisited, and Other Poems""--contains two, which Wordsworth himself"
702,THE LIFE.,tells us were composed earlier; and there is no reason why these poems
703,THE LIFE.,should not be restored to their chronological place. The series of
704,THE LIFE.,"itinerary sonnets, published along with them in the Yarrow volume of"
705,THE LIFE.,"1835, is the record of another Scottish tour, taken in the year 1833;"
706,THE LIFE.,"and Wordsworth says of them that they were ""composed 'or suggested'"
707,THE LIFE.,"during a tour in the summer of 1833."" We cannot now discover which of"
708,THE LIFE.,"them were written during the tour, and which at Rydal Mount after his"
709,THE LIFE.,return; but it is obvious that they should be printed in the order in
710,THE LIFE.,"which they were left by him, in 1835. It may be noted that almost all"
711,THE LIFE.,"the ""Evening Voluntaries"" belong to these years--1832 to 1835--when the"
712,THE LIFE.,author was from sixty-two to sixty-five years of age.
713,THE LIFE.,
714,THE LIFE.,Wordsworth's habit of revision may perhaps explain the mistakes into
715,THE LIFE.,"which he occasionally fell as to the dates of his Poems, and the"
716,THE LIFE.,"difficulty of reconciling what he says, as to the year of composition,"
717,THE LIFE.,with the date assigned by his sister in her Journal. When he says
718,THE LIFE.,"""written in 1801, or 1802,"" he may be referring to the last revision"
719,THE LIFE.,"which he gave to his work. Certain it is, however, that he sometimes"
720,THE LIFE.,"gave a date for the composition, which was subsequent to the publication"
721,THE LIFE.,of the poem in question.
722,THE LIFE.,
723,THE LIFE.,"In the case of those poems to which no date was attached, I have tried"
724,THE LIFE.,"to find a clue by which to fix an approximate one. Obviously, it would"
725,THE LIFE.,not do to place all the undated poems in a class by themselves. Such an
726,THE LIFE.,"arrangement would be thoroughly artificial; and, while we are in many"
727,THE LIFE.,"instances left to conjecture, we can always say that such and such a"
728,THE LIFE.,poem was composed not later than a particular year. When the precise
729,THE LIFE.,"date is undiscoverable, I have thought it best to place the poem in or"
730,THE LIFE.,immediately before the year in which it was first published.
731,THE LIFE.,
732,THE LIFE.,"Poems which were several years in process of composition, having been"
733,THE LIFE.,"laid aside, and taken up repeatedly; 'e.g. The Prelude', which was"
734,THE LIFE.,composed between the years 1799 and 1805--are placed in the year in
735,THE LIFE.,which they were finished. Disputable questions as to the date of any
736,THE LIFE.,poem are dealt with in the editorial note prefixed or appended to it.
737,THE LIFE.,
738,THE LIFE.,There is one Poem which I have intentionally placed out of its
739,THE LIFE.,"chronological place, viz. the 'Ode, Intimations of Immortality from"
740,THE LIFE.,Recollections of Early Childhood'. It was written at intervals from 1803
741,THE LIFE.,"to 1806, and was first published in the edition of 1807, where it stood"
742,THE LIFE.,at the end of the second volume. In every subsequent edition of the
743,THE LIFE.,collected Works--1815 to 1850--it closed the groups of poems; 'The
744,THE LIFE.,"Excursion' only following it, in a volume of its own. This was an"
745,THE LIFE.,"arrangement made by Wordsworth, of set purpose, and steadily adhered"
746,THE LIFE.,to--the 'Ode' forming as it were the High Altar of his poetic Cathedral.
747,THE LIFE.,As he wished it to retain that place in subsequent editions of his
748,THE LIFE.,"Works, it retains it in this one."
749,THE LIFE.,
750,THE LIFE.,"Mr. Arnold's arrangement of the Poems, in his volume of Selections [4],"
751,THE LIFE.,"is extremely interesting and valuable; but, as to the method of grouping"
752,THE LIFE.,"adopted, I am not sure that it is better than Wordsworth's own. As a"
753,THE LIFE.,"descriptive title, ""Poems of Sentiment and Reflection"" is quite as good"
754,THE LIFE.,"as ""Poems akin to the Antique,"" and ""Poems of the Fancy"" quite as"
755,THE LIFE.,"appropriate as ""Poems of Ballad Form."""
756,THE LIFE.,
757,THE LIFE.,Wordsworth's arrangement of his Poems in groups was psychologically very
758,THE LIFE.,interesting; but it is open to many objections. Unfortunately Wordsworth
759,THE LIFE.,was not himself consistent--in the various editions issued by
760,THE LIFE.,"himself--either in the class into which he relegated each poem, or the"
761,THE LIFE.,order in which he placed it there. There is tantalising topsy-turvyism
762,THE LIFE.,"in this, so that an editor who adopts it is almost compelled to select"
763,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth's latest grouping, which was not always his best."
764,THE LIFE.,
765,THE LIFE.,Sir William Rowan Hamilton wrote to Mr. Aubrey de Vere in 1835 that Dora
766,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth told him that her father ""was sometimes at a loss whether to"
767,THE LIFE.,"refer her to the 'Poems of the Imagination,' or the 'Poems of the"
768,THE LIFE.,"Fancy,' for some particular passage."" Aubrey de Vere himself considered"
769,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth's arrangement as ""a parade of system,"" and wrote of it, ""I"
770,THE LIFE.,"cannot help thinking that in it, he mistakes classification for method."""
771,THE LIFE.,[5] I confess that it is often difficult to see why some of the poems
772,THE LIFE.,"were assigned by their author to the realm of the ""Fancy,"" the"
773,THE LIFE.,"""Imagination,"" and ""Sentiment and Reflection"" respectively. In a note to"
774,THE LIFE.,'The Horn of Egremont Castle' (edition 1815) Wordsworth speaks of it as
775,THE LIFE.,"""referring to the imagination,"" rather than as being ""produced by it"";"
776,THE LIFE.,"and says that he would not have placed it amongst his ""Poems of the"
777,THE LIFE.,"Imagination,"" ""but to avoid a needless multiplication of classes""; and"
778,THE LIFE.,in the editions of 1827 and 1832 he actually included the great 'Ode' on
779,THE LIFE.,"Immortality among his ""Epitaphs and Elegiac Poems""! As late as 27th"
780,THE LIFE.,"September 1845, he wrote to Professor Henry Reed,"
781,THE LIFE.,
782,THE LIFE.,"""Following your example"" (i. e. the example set in Reed's American"
783,THE LIFE.,"edition of the Poems), ""I have greatly extended the class entitled"
784,THE LIFE.,"'Poems of the Imagination,' thinking as you must have done that, if"
785,THE LIFE.,"Imagination were predominant in the class, it was not indispensable"
786,THE LIFE.,that it should pervade every poem which it contained. Limiting the
787,THE LIFE.,"class as I had done before, seemed to imply, and to the uncandid or"
788,THE LIFE.,"observing did so, that the faculty, which is the 'primum mobile' in"
789,THE LIFE.,"poetry, had little to do, in the estimation of the author, with pieces"
790,THE LIFE.,not arranged under that head. I therefore feel much obliged to you for
791,THE LIFE.,"suggesting by your practice the plan which I have adopted."""
792,THE LIFE.,
793,THE LIFE.,Could anything show more explicitly than this that Wordsworth was not
794,THE LIFE.,"perfectly satisfied with his own artificial groups? Professor Reed, in"
795,THE LIFE.,"his American edition of 1837, however, acted on Wordsworth's expressed"
796,THE LIFE.,"intention of distributing the contents of ""Yarrow Revisited, and Other"
797,THE LIFE.,"Poems"" amongst the classes. He tells us that he ""interspersed the"
798,THE LIFE.,"contents of this volume among the Poems already arranged"" by Wordsworth."
799,THE LIFE.,[6]
800,THE LIFE.,
801,THE LIFE.,"It may also be mentioned that not only members of his own household, but"
802,THE LIFE.,many of Wordsworth's friends--notably Charles Lamb--expressed a
803,THE LIFE.,preference for a different arrangement of his Poems from that which he
804,THE LIFE.,had adopted.
805,THE LIFE.,
806,THE LIFE.,
807,THE LIFE.,"SECOND The various Readings, or variations of text, made by Wordsworth"
808,THE LIFE.,"during his lifetime, or written by him on copies of his Poems, or"
809,THE LIFE.,"discovered in MS. letters, from himself, or his sister, or his wife, are"
810,THE LIFE.,given in footnotes in this edition. Few English poets changed their text
811,THE LIFE.,"more frequently, or with more fastidiousness, than Wordsworth did. He"
812,THE LIFE.,"did not always alter it for the better. Every alteration however, which"
813,THE LIFE.,"has been discovered by me, whether for the better or for the worse, is"
814,THE LIFE.,here printed in full. We have thus a record of the fluctuations of his
815,THE LIFE.,own mind as to the form in which he wished his Poems to appear; and this
816,THE LIFE.,record casts considerable light on the development of his genius. [7]
817,THE LIFE.,
818,THE LIFE.,A knowledge of these changes of text can only be obtained in one or
819,THE LIFE.,other of two ways. Either the reader must have access to all the
820,THE LIFE.,"thirty-two editions of Poems, the publication of which Wordsworth"
821,THE LIFE.,"personally supervised; or, he must have all the changes in the"
822,THE LIFE.,"successive editions, exhibited in the form of footnotes, and appended to"
823,THE LIFE.,the particular text that is selected and printed in the body of the
824,THE LIFE.,work. It is extremely difficult--in some cases quite impossible--to
825,THE LIFE.,obtain the early editions. The great public libraries of the country do
826,THE LIFE.,not possess them all.[8] It is therefore necessary to fall back upon the
827,THE LIFE.,"latter plan, which seems the only one by which a knowledge of the"
828,THE LIFE.,"changes of the text can be made accessible, either to the general"
829,THE LIFE.,"reader, or to the special student of English Poetry."
830,THE LIFE.,
831,THE LIFE.,The text which--after much consideration--I have resolved to place
832,THE LIFE.,"throughout, in the body of the work, is Wordsworth's own final 'textus"
833,THE LIFE.,"receptus', i.e. the text of 1849-50, reproduced in the posthumous"
834,THE LIFE.,edition of 1857; [9] and since opinion will doubtless differ as to the
835,THE LIFE.,"wisdom of this selection, it may be desirable to state at some length"
836,THE LIFE.,the reasons which have led me to adopt it.
837,THE LIFE.,
838,THE LIFE.,"There are only three possible courses open to an editor, who wishes to"
839,THE LIFE.,give--along with the text selected--all the various readings
840,THE LIFE.,"chronologically arranged as footnotes. Either, 1st, the earliest text"
841,THE LIFE.,"may be taken, or 2nd, the latest may be chosen, or 3rd, the text may be"
842,THE LIFE.,"selected from different editions, so as to present each poem in its best"
843,THE LIFE.,"state (according to the judgment of the editor), in whatever edition it"
844,THE LIFE.,"is found. A composite text, made up from two or more editions, would be"
845,THE LIFE.,inadmissible.
846,THE LIFE.,
847,THE LIFE.,"Now, most persons who have studied the subject know that Wordsworth's"
848,THE LIFE.,"best text is to be found, in one poem in its earliest edition, in"
849,THE LIFE.,"another in its latest, and in a third in some intermediate edition. I"
850,THE LIFE.,cannot agree either with the statement that he always altered for the
851,THE LIFE.,"worse, or that he always altered for the better. His critical judgment"
852,THE LIFE.,"was not nearly so unerring in this respect as Coleridge's was, or as"
853,THE LIFE.,"Tennyson's has been. It may be difficult, therefore, to assign an"
854,THE LIFE.,altogether satisfactory reason for adopting either the earliest or the
855,THE LIFE.,"latest text; and at first sight, the remaining alternative plan may seem"
856,THE LIFE.,the wisest of the three. There are indeed difficulties in the way of the
857,THE LIFE.,adoption of any one of the methods suggested; and as I adopt the latest
858,THE LIFE.,"text--not because it is always intrinsically the best, but on other"
859,THE LIFE.,"grounds to be immediately stated--it may clear the way, if reference be"
860,THE LIFE.,"made in the first instance to the others, and to the reasons for"
861,THE LIFE.,abandoning them.
862,THE LIFE.,
863,THE LIFE.,"As to a selection of the text from various editions, this would"
864,THE LIFE.,"doubtless be the best plan, were it a practicable one; and perhaps it"
865,THE LIFE.,may be attainable some day. But Wordsworth is as yet too near us for
866,THE LIFE.,such an editorial treatment of his Works to be successful. The
867,THE LIFE.,fundamental objection to it is that scarcely two minds--even among the
868,THE LIFE.,most competent of contemporary judges--will agree as to what the best
869,THE LIFE.,text is. An edition arranged on this principle could not possibly be
870,THE LIFE.,acceptable to more than a few persons. Of course no arrangement of any
871,THE LIFE.,kind can escape adverse criticism: it would be most unfortunate if it
872,THE LIFE.,"did. But this particular edition would fail in its main purpose, if"
873,THE LIFE.,"questions of individual taste were made primary, and not secondary; and"
874,THE LIFE.,"an arrangement, which gave scope for the arbitrary selection of"
875,THE LIFE.,"particular texts,--according to the wisdom, or the want of wisdom, of"
876,THE LIFE.,"the editor,--would deservedly meet with severe criticism in many"
877,THE LIFE.,"quarters. Besides, such a method of arrangement would not indicate the"
878,THE LIFE.,"growth of the Poet's mind, and the development of his genius. If an"
879,THE LIFE.,editor wished to indicate his own opinion of the best text for each
880,THE LIFE.,poem--under the idea that his judgment might be of some use to other
881,THE LIFE.,people--it would be wiser to do so by means of some mark or marginal
882,THE LIFE.,"note, than by printing his selected text in the main body of the work."
883,THE LIFE.,"He could thus at once preserve the chronological order of the readings,"
884,THE LIFE.,"indicate his own preference, and leave it to others to select what they"
885,THE LIFE.,"preferred. Besides, the compiler of such an edition would often find"
886,THE LIFE.,"himself in doubt as to what the best text really was, the merit of the"
887,THE LIFE.,"different readings being sometimes almost equal, or very nearly"
888,THE LIFE.,"balanced; and, were he to endeavour to get out of the difficulty by"
889,THE LIFE.,"obtaining the judgments of literary men, or even of contemporary poets,"
890,THE LIFE.,"he would find that their opinions would in most cases be dissimilar, if"
891,THE LIFE.,they did not openly conflict. Those who cannot come to a final decision
892,THE LIFE.,as to their own text would not be likely to agree as to the merits of
893,THE LIFE.,particular readings in the poems of their predecessors. Unanimity of
894,THE LIFE.,opinion on this point is indeed quite unattainable.
895,THE LIFE.,
896,THE LIFE.,"Nevertheless, it would be easy for an editor to show the unfortunate"
897,THE LIFE.,result of keeping rigorously either to the latest or to the earliest
898,THE LIFE.,"text of Wordsworth. If, on the one hand, the latest were taken, it could"
899,THE LIFE.,"be shown that many of the changes introduced into it were for the worse,"
900,THE LIFE.,"and some of them very decidedly so. For example, in the poem 'To a"
901,THE LIFE.,"Skylark'--composed in 1825--the second verse, retained in the"
902,THE LIFE.,"editions of 1827, 1832, 1836, and 1843, was unaccountably dropped out in"
903,THE LIFE.,the editions of 1845 and 1849. The following is the complete poem of
904,THE LIFE.,"1825, as published in 1827."
905,THE LIFE.,
906,THE LIFE.,
907,THE LIFE.,Ethereal Minstrel! Pilgrim of the sky!
908,THE LIFE.,Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound?
909,THE LIFE.,"Or, while the wings aspire, are heart and eye"
910,THE LIFE.,Both with thy nest upon the dewy ground?
911,THE LIFE.,"Thy nest which thou canst drop into at will,"
912,THE LIFE.,"Those quivering wings composed, that music still!"
913,THE LIFE.,
914,THE LIFE.,"To the last point of vision, and beyond,"
915,THE LIFE.,"Mount, daring Warbler! that love-prompted strain,"
916,THE LIFE.,('Twixt thee and thine a never-failing bond)
917,THE LIFE.,Thrills not the less the bosom of the plain:
918,THE LIFE.,"Yet might'st thou seem, proud privilege! to sing"
919,THE LIFE.,All independent of the leafy spring.
920,THE LIFE.,
921,THE LIFE.,Leave to the Nightingale her shady wood;
922,THE LIFE.,A privacy of glorious light is thine;
923,THE LIFE.,Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood
924,THE LIFE.,"Of harmony, with rapture more divine;"
925,THE LIFE.,"Type of the wise who soar, but never roam;"
926,THE LIFE.,True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home!
927,THE LIFE.,
928,THE LIFE.,
929,THE LIFE.,"There is no doubt that the first and third stanzas are the finest, and"
930,THE LIFE.,some may respect the judgment that cut down the Poem by the removal of
931,THE LIFE.,"its second verse: but others will say, if it was right that such a verse"
932,THE LIFE.,"should be removed, why were many others of questionable merit allowed to"
933,THE LIFE.,"remain? Why was such a poem as 'The Glowworm', of the edition of 1807,"
934,THE LIFE.,"never republished; while 'The Waterfall and the Eglantine', and 'To the"
935,THE LIFE.,"Spade of a Friend', were retained? To give one other illustration, where"
936,THE LIFE.,"a score are possible. In the sonnet, belonging to the year 1807,"
937,THE LIFE.,beginning:
938,THE LIFE.,
939,THE LIFE.,"""Beloved Vale!"" I said, ""when I shall con,"""
940,THE LIFE.,
941,THE LIFE.,"we find, in the latest text, the lines--first adopted in 1827:"
942,THE LIFE.,
943,THE LIFE.,"I stood, of simple shame the blushing Thrall;"
944,THE LIFE.,"So narrow seemed the brooks, the fields so small,"
945,THE LIFE.,
946,THE LIFE.,while the early edition of 1807 contains the far happier lines:
947,THE LIFE.,
948,THE LIFE.,"To see the Trees, which I had thought so tall,"
949,THE LIFE.,"Mere dwarfs; the Brooks so narrow, Fields so small."
950,THE LIFE.,
951,THE LIFE.,"On the other hand, if the earliest text be invariably retained, some of"
952,THE LIFE.,"the best poems will be spoiled (or the improvements lost), since"
953,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth did usually alter for the better. For example, few persons"
954,THE LIFE.,will doubt that the form in which the second stanza of the poem 'To the
955,THE LIFE.,"Cuckoo' (written in 1802) appeared in 1845, is an improvement on all its"
956,THE LIFE.,"predecessors. I give the readings of 1807, 1815, 1820, 1827, and 1845."
957,THE LIFE.,
958,THE LIFE.,
959,THE LIFE.,"While I am lying on the grass,"
960,THE LIFE.,I hear thy restless shout:
961,THE LIFE.,"From hill to hill it seems to pass,"
962,THE LIFE.,"About, and all about!                        1807."
963,THE LIFE.,
964,THE LIFE.,"While I am lying on the grass,"
965,THE LIFE.,Thy loud note smites my ear!--
966,THE LIFE.,"From hill to hill it seems to pass,"
967,THE LIFE.,At once far off and near!                    1815.
968,THE LIFE.,
969,THE LIFE.,"While I am lying on the grass,"
970,THE LIFE.,Thy loud note smites my ear!
971,THE LIFE.,"It seems to fill the whole air's space,"
972,THE LIFE.,At once far off and near.                    1820.
973,THE LIFE.,
974,THE LIFE.,While I am lying on the grass
975,THE LIFE.,"Thy twofold shout I hear,"
976,THE LIFE.,"That seems to fill the whole air's space,"
977,THE LIFE.,As loud far off as near.                     1827.
978,THE LIFE.,
979,THE LIFE.,While I am lying on the grass
980,THE LIFE.,"Thy twofold shout I hear,"
981,THE LIFE.,"From hill to hill it seems to pass,"
982,THE LIFE.,"At once far off, and near.                   1845."
983,THE LIFE.,
984,THE LIFE.,
985,THE LIFE.,"Similarly, in each of the three poems 'To the Daisy', composed in 1802,"
986,THE LIFE.,"and in the 'Afterthought, to the Duddon', the alterations introduced"
987,THE LIFE.,into the latest editions were all improvements upon the early version.
988,THE LIFE.,
989,THE LIFE.,It might be urged that these considerations would warrant the
990,THE LIFE.,"interference of an editor, and justify him in selecting the text which"
991,THE LIFE.,he thought the best upon the whole; but this must be left to posterity.
992,THE LIFE.,"When editors can escape the bias of contemporary thought and feeling,"
993,THE LIFE.,when their judgments are refined by distance and mellowed by the new
994,THE LIFE.,"literary standards of the intervening years,--when in fact Wordsworth is"
995,THE LIFE.,as far away from his critics as Shakespeare now is--it may be possible
996,THE LIFE.,to adjust a final text. But the task is beyond the power of the present
997,THE LIFE.,generation.
998,THE LIFE.,
999,THE LIFE.,"It may farther be urged that if this reasoning be valid,--and if, for"
1000,THE LIFE.,"the present, one text must be retained uniformly throughout,--the"
1001,THE LIFE.,"natural plan is to take the earliest, and not the latest; and this has"
1002,THE LIFE.,"some recommendations. It seems more simple, more natural, and certainly"
1003,THE LIFE.,"the easiest. We have a natural sequence, if we begin with the earliest"
1004,THE LIFE.,"and go on to the latest readings. Then, all the readers of Wordsworth,"
1005,THE LIFE.,"who care to possess or to consult the present edition, will doubtless"
1006,THE LIFE.,"possess one or other of the complete copies of his works, which contain"
1007,THE LIFE.,his final text; while probably not one in twenty have ever seen the
1008,THE LIFE.,"first edition of any of his poems, with the exception of 'The Prelude'."
1009,THE LIFE.,It is true that if the reader turns to a footnote to compare the
1010,THE LIFE.,"versions of different years, while he is reading for the sake of the"
1011,THE LIFE.,"poetry, he will be so distracted that the effect of the poem as a whole"
1012,THE LIFE.,"will be entirely lost; because the critical spirit, which judges of the"
1013,THE LIFE.,"text, works apart from the spirit of sympathetic appreciation, in which"
1014,THE LIFE.,all poetry should be read. But it is not necessary to turn to the
1015,THE LIFE.,"footnotes, and to mark what may be called the literary growth of a poem,"
1016,THE LIFE.,while it is being read for its own sake: and these notes are printed in
1017,THE LIFE.,"smaller type, so as not to obtrude themselves on the eye of the reader."
1018,THE LIFE.,
1019,THE LIFE.,"Against the adoption of the earlier text, there is this fatal objection,"
1020,THE LIFE.,"that if it is to be done at all, it must be done throughout; and, in the"
1021,THE LIFE.,earliest poems Wordsworth wrote--viz. 'An Evening Walk' and 'Descriptive
1022,THE LIFE.,"Sketches',--the subsequent alterations almost amounted to a cancelling"
1023,THE LIFE.,"of the earlier version. His changes were all, or almost all,"
1024,THE LIFE.,"unmistakably for the better. Indeed, there was little in these works--in"
1025,THE LIFE.,the form in which they first appeared--to lead to the belief that an
1026,THE LIFE.,original poet had arisen in England. It is true that Coleridge saw in
1027,THE LIFE.,"them the signs of the dawn of a new era, and wrote thus of 'Descriptive"
1028,THE LIFE.,"Sketches', before he knew its author, ""Seldom, if ever, was the"
1029,THE LIFE.,emergence of a great and original poetic genius above the literary
1030,THE LIFE.,"horizon more evidently announced."" Nevertheless the earliest text of"
1031,THE LIFE.,"these 'Sketches' is, in many places, so artificial, prosaic, and dull,"
1032,THE LIFE.,"that its reproduction (except as an appendix, or in the form of"
1033,THE LIFE.,"footnotes) would be an injustice to Wordsworth. [10] On the other hand,"
1034,THE LIFE.,"the passages subsequently cancelled are so numerous, and so long, that"
1035,THE LIFE.,if placed in footnotes the latter would in some instances be more
1036,THE LIFE.,extensive than the text. The quarto of 1793 will therefore be reprinted
1037,THE LIFE.,in full as an Appendix to the first volume of this edition. The 'School
1038,THE LIFE.,"Exercise written at Hawkshead' in the poet's fourteenth year, will be"
1039,THE LIFE.,"found in vol. viii. Passing over these juvenile efforts, there are"
1040,THE LIFE.,"poems--such as 'Guilt and Sorrow', 'Peter Bell', and many others--in"
1041,THE LIFE.,"which the earlier text is an inferior one, which was either corrected or"
1042,THE LIFE.,abandoned by Wordsworth in his maturer years. It would be a conspicuous
1043,THE LIFE.,"blunder to print--in the place of honour,--the crude original which was"
1044,THE LIFE.,afterwards repudiated by its author.
1045,THE LIFE.,
1046,THE LIFE.,"It may be remembered, in connection with Wordsworth's text, that he"
1047,THE LIFE.,"himself said, ""I am for the most part uncertain about my success in"
1048,THE LIFE.,"altering poems; but, in this case"" (he is speaking of an insertion) ""I"
1049,THE LIFE.,"am sure I have produced a great improvement."" ('Memoirs of Wordsworth',"
1050,THE LIFE.,"vol. i. p. 174.) [11] Again, in writing to Mr. Dyce in 1830, ""You know"
1051,THE LIFE.,what importance I attach to following strictly the last copy of the text
1052,THE LIFE.,"of an author."""
1053,THE LIFE.,
1054,THE LIFE.,It is also worthy of note that the study of their chronology casts some
1055,THE LIFE.,light on the changes which the poems underwent. The second edition of
1056,THE LIFE.,"""Lyrical Ballads"" appeared in 1800. In that edition the text of 1798 is"
1057,THE LIFE.,"scarcely altered: but, in the year in which it was published, Wordsworth"
1058,THE LIFE.,"was engrossed with his settlement at Grasmere; and, in the springtime of"
1059,THE LIFE.,"creative work, he probably never thought of revising his earlier pieces."
1060,THE LIFE.,"In the year 1800, he composed at least twenty-five new poems. The third"
1061,THE LIFE.,"edition of ""Lyrical Ballads"" appeared in 1802; and during that year he"
1062,THE LIFE.,"wrote forty-three new poems, many of them amongst the most perfect of"
1063,THE LIFE.,his Lyrics. His critical instinct had become much more delicate since
1064,THE LIFE.,1800: and it is not surprising to find--as we do find--that between the
1065,THE LIFE.,"text of the ""Lyrical Ballads"" of 1800, and that of 1802, there are many"
1066,THE LIFE.,"important variations. This is seen, for example, in the way in which he"
1067,THE LIFE.,"dealt with 'The Female Vagrant', which is altered throughout. Its early"
1068,THE LIFE.,"redundance is pruned away; and, in many instances, the final text,"
1069,THE LIFE.,"sanctioned in 1845, had been adopted in 1803. Without going into further"
1070,THE LIFE.,"detail, it is sufficient to remark that in the year 1803 Wordsworth's"
1071,THE LIFE.,"critical faculty, the faculty of censorship, had developed almost step"
1072,THE LIFE.,for step with the creative originality of his genius. In that prolific
1073,THE LIFE.,"year, when week by week, almost day by day, fresh poems were thrown off"
1074,THE LIFE.,with marvellous facility--as we see from his sister's Journal--he had
1075,THE LIFE.,"become a severe, if not a fastidious, critic of his own earlier work. A"
1076,THE LIFE.,"further explanation of the absence of critical revision, in the edition"
1077,THE LIFE.,"of 1800, may be found in the fact that during that year Wordsworth was"
1078,THE LIFE.,"engaged in writing the ""Preface"" to his Poems; which dealt, in so"
1079,THE LIFE.,"remarkable a manner, with the nature of Poetry in general, and with his"
1080,THE LIFE.,own theory of it in particular.
1081,THE LIFE.,
1082,THE LIFE.,A further reference to the 'Evening Walk' will illustrate Wordsworth's
1083,THE LIFE.,way of dealing with his earlier text in his later editions. This Poem
1084,THE LIFE.,showed from the first a minute observation of Nature--not only in her
1085,THE LIFE.,"external form and colour, but also in her suggestiveness--though not in"
1086,THE LIFE.,"her symbolism; and we also find the same transition from Nature to Man,"
1087,THE LIFE.,"the same interest in rural life, and the same lingering over its"
1088,THE LIFE.,"incidents that we see in his maturer poems. Nevertheless, there is much"
1089,THE LIFE.,"that is conventional in the first edition of 'An Evening Walk',"
1090,THE LIFE.,"published in 1793. I need only mention, as a sample, the use of the"
1091,THE LIFE.,"phrase ""silent tides"" to describe the waters of a lake. When this poem"
1092,THE LIFE.,"was revised, in the year 1815--with a view to its insertion in the first"
1093,THE LIFE.,edition of the collected works--Wordsworth merely omitted large portions
1094,THE LIFE.,"of it, and some of its best passages were struck out. He scarcely"
1095,THE LIFE.,"amended the text at all. In 1820, however, he pruned and improved it"
1096,THE LIFE.,"throughout; so that between this poem, as recast in 1820 (and reproduced"
1097,THE LIFE.,"almost 'verbatim' in the next two editions of 1827 and 1832), and his"
1098,THE LIFE.,"happiest descriptions of Nature in his most inspired moods, there is no"
1099,THE LIFE.,"great difference. But, in 1836, he altered it still further in detail;"
1100,THE LIFE.,"and in that state practically left it, apparently not caring to revise"
1101,THE LIFE.,"it further. In the edition of 1845, however, there are several changes."
1102,THE LIFE.,"So far as I can judge, there is one alteration for the worse, and one"
1103,THE LIFE.,"only. The reading, in the edition of 1793,"
1104,THE LIFE.,
1105,THE LIFE.,"In these lone vales, if aught of faith may claim,"
1106,THE LIFE.,"Thin silver hairs, and ancient hamlet fame;"
1107,THE LIFE.,"When up the hills, as now, retreats the light,"
1108,THE LIFE.,"Strange apparitions mock the village sight,"
1109,THE LIFE.,
1110,THE LIFE.,"is better than that finally adopted,"
1111,THE LIFE.,
1112,THE LIFE.,"In these secluded vales, if village fame,"
1113,THE LIFE.,"Confirmed by hoary hairs, belief may claim;"
1114,THE LIFE.,"When up the hills, as now, retired the light,"
1115,THE LIFE.,Strange apparitions mocked the shepherd's sight.
1116,THE LIFE.,
1117,THE LIFE.,"It will be seen, however, from the changes made in the text of this"
1118,THE LIFE.,"poem, how Wordsworth's observation of Nature developed, how thoroughly"
1119,THE LIFE.,"dissatisfied he soon became with everything conventional, and discarded"
1120,THE LIFE.,every image not drawn directly or at first hand from Nature.
1121,THE LIFE.,
1122,THE LIFE.,"The text adopted in the present edition is, for the reasons stated, that"
1123,THE LIFE.,"which was finally sanctioned by Wordsworth himself, in the last edition"
1124,THE LIFE.,"of his Poems (1849-50). The earlier readings, occurring in previous"
1125,THE LIFE.,"editions, are given in footnotes; and it may be desirable to explain the"
1126,THE LIFE.,way in which these are arranged. It will be seen that whenever the text
1127,THE LIFE.,"has been changed a date is given in the footnote, 'before' the other"
1128,THE LIFE.,"readings are added. This date, which accompanies the reference number of"
1129,THE LIFE.,"the footnote, indicates the year in which the reading finally retained"
1130,THE LIFE.,"was first adopted by Wordsworth. The earlier readings then follow, in"
1131,THE LIFE.,"chronological order, with the year to which they belong; [12] and it is"
1132,THE LIFE.,in every case to be assumed that the last of the changes indicated was
1133,THE LIFE.,continued in all subsequent editions of the works. No direct information
1134,THE LIFE.,"is given as to how long a particular reading was retained, or through"
1135,THE LIFE.,"how many editions it ran. It is to be assumed, however, that it was"
1136,THE LIFE.,retained in all intermediate editions till the next change of text is
1137,THE LIFE.,"stated. It would encumber the notes with too many figures if, in every"
1138,THE LIFE.,"instance in which a change was made, the corresponding state of the text"
1139,THE LIFE.,in all the other editions was indicated. But if no new reading follows
1140,THE LIFE.,"the text quoted, it is to be taken for granted that the reading in"
1141,THE LIFE.,"question was continued in every subsequent edition, until the date which"
1142,THE LIFE.,accompanies the reference figure.
1143,THE LIFE.,
1144,THE LIFE.,Two illustrations will make this clear. The first is a case in which the
1145,THE LIFE.,"text was only altered once, the second an instance in which it was"
1146,THE LIFE.,altered six times. In the 'Evening Walk' the following lines occur--
1147,THE LIFE.,
1148,THE LIFE.,"The dog, loud barking, 'mid the glittering rocks,"
1149,THE LIFE.,"Hunts, where his master points, the intercepted flocks."
1150,THE LIFE.,
1151,THE LIFE.,And the footnote is as follows:
1152,THE LIFE.,
1153,THE LIFE.,1836.
1154,THE LIFE.,"That, barking busy 'mid the glittering rocks,"
1155,THE LIFE.,"Hunts, where he points, the intercepted flocks; 1793."
1156,THE LIFE.,
1157,THE LIFE.,"In the light of what has been said above, and by reference to the"
1158,THE LIFE.,"Bibliography, it will be seen from these two dates that the original"
1159,THE LIFE.,text of 1793--given in the footnote--was continued in the editions of
1160,THE LIFE.,"1820, 1827, and 1832 (it was omitted from the ""extract"" of 1815); that"
1161,THE LIFE.,it was changed in the year 1836; and that this reading was retained in
1162,THE LIFE.,"the editions of 1843, 1845, and 1849."
1163,THE LIFE.,
1164,THE LIFE.,"Again, in 'Simon Lee', the lines occur:"
1165,THE LIFE.,
1166,THE LIFE.,But what to them avails the land
1167,THE LIFE.,Which he can till no longer?
1168,THE LIFE.,
1169,THE LIFE.,And the following are the footnotes:
1170,THE LIFE.,
1171,THE LIFE.,1845.
1172,THE LIFE.,"But what avails the land to them,"
1173,THE LIFE.,Which they can till no longer?       1798.
1174,THE LIFE.,
1175,THE LIFE.,"""But what,"" saith he, ""avails the land,"
1176,THE LIFE.,Which I can till no longer?          1827.
1177,THE LIFE.,
1178,THE LIFE.,"But what avails it now, the land"
1179,THE LIFE.,Which he can till no longer?         1832.
1180,THE LIFE.,
1181,THE LIFE.,"'Tis his, but what avails the land"
1182,THE LIFE.,Which he can till no longer?         1837.
1183,THE LIFE.,
1184,THE LIFE.,"The time, alas! is come when he"
1185,THE LIFE.,Can till the land no longer.         1840.
1186,THE LIFE.,
1187,THE LIFE.,The time is also come when he
1188,THE LIFE.,Can till the land no longer.         C.
1189,THE LIFE.,
1190,THE LIFE.,
1191,THE LIFE.,From this it will be seen that the text adopted in the first edition of
1192,THE LIFE.,"""Lyrical Ballads"" in 1798 was retained in the editions of 1800, 1802,"
1193,THE LIFE.,"1805, 1815, and 1820; that it was altered in each of the editions of"
1194,THE LIFE.,"1827, 1832, 1837, 1840, as also in the MS. readings in Lord Coleridge's"
1195,THE LIFE.,"copy of the works, and in the edition of 1845;  and that the version of"
1196,THE LIFE.,1845 was retained in the edition of 1849-50. It should be added that
1197,THE LIFE.,"when a verse, or stanza, or line--occurring in one or other of the"
1198,THE LIFE.,"earlier editions--was omitted from that of 1849, the footnote simply"
1199,THE LIFE.,contains the extract along with the date of the year or years in which
1200,THE LIFE.,"it occurs; and that, in such cases, the date does not follow the"
1201,THE LIFE.,"reference number of the footnote, but is placed for obvious reasons at"
1202,THE LIFE.,the end of the extract.
1203,THE LIFE.,
1204,THE LIFE.,"The same thing is true of 'Descriptive Sketches'. In the year 1827,"
1205,THE LIFE.,"there were scarcely any alterations made on the text of the poem, as"
1206,THE LIFE.,printed in 1820; still fewer were added in 1832; but for the edition of
1207,THE LIFE.,"1836 the whole was virtually rewritten, and in that state it was finally"
1208,THE LIFE.,"left, although a few significant changes were made in 1845."
1209,THE LIFE.,
1210,THE LIFE.,"Slight changes of spelling which occur in the successive editions, are"
1211,THE LIFE.,"not mentioned. When, however, the change is one of transposition,"
1212,THE LIFE.,"although the text remains unaltered,--as is largely the case in 'Simon"
1213,THE LIFE.,"Lee', for example--it is always indicated."
1214,THE LIFE.,
1215,THE LIFE.,"It will be further observed that, at the beginning of every poem, two"
1216,THE LIFE.,"dates are given; the first, on the left-hand side, is the date of"
1217,THE LIFE.,"composition; the second, on the right-hand side, is the date of the"
1218,THE LIFE.,"first publication. In what class the poem first appeared, and the"
1219,THE LIFE.,"changes (if any) which subsequently occurred in its title, are mentioned"
1220,THE LIFE.,in the note appended.
1221,THE LIFE.,
1222,THE LIFE.,
1223,THE LIFE.,"THIRD. In the present edition several suggested changes of text, which"
1224,THE LIFE.,were written by Wordsworth on the margin of a copy of his edition of
1225,THE LIFE.,"1836-7, which he kept beside him at Rydal Mount, are published. These"
1226,THE LIFE.,"MS. notes seem to have been written by himself, or dictated to others,"
1227,THE LIFE.,"at intervals between the years 1836 and 1850, and they are thus a record"
1228,THE LIFE.,"of passing thoughts, or ""moods of his own mind,"" during these years."
1229,THE LIFE.,"Some of these were afterwards introduced into the editions of 1842,"
1230,THE LIFE.,"1846, and 1849; others were not made use of. The latter have now a value"
1231,THE LIFE.,"of their own, as indicating certain new phases of thought and feeling,"
1232,THE LIFE.,"in Wordsworth's later years. I owe my knowledge of them, and the"
1233,THE LIFE.,"permission to use them, to the kindness of the late Chief Justice of"
1234,THE LIFE.,"England, Lord Coleridge. The following is an extract from a letter from"
1235,THE LIFE.,him:
1236,THE LIFE.,
1237,THE LIFE.,
1238,THE LIFE.,"""FOX GHYLL, AMBLESIDE, '4th October 1881'."
1239,THE LIFE.,
1240,THE LIFE.,"""I have been long intending to write you as to the manuscript notes"
1241,THE LIFE.,"and alterations in Wordsworth's poems, which you have had the"
1242,THE LIFE.,"opportunity of seeing, and, so far as you thought fit, of using for"
1243,THE LIFE.,your edition. They came into my possession in this way. I saw them
1244,THE LIFE.,"advertised in a catalogue which was sent me, and at my request the"
1245,THE LIFE.,book was very courteously forwarded to me for my inspection. It
1246,THE LIFE.,appeared to me of sufficient interest and value to induce me to buy
1247,THE LIFE.,it; and I accordingly became the purchaser.
1248,THE LIFE.,
1249,THE LIFE.,"""It is a copy of the edition in six volumes, the publication of which"
1250,THE LIFE.,began in the year 1836; and of the volume containing the collected
1251,THE LIFE.,"sonnets, which was afterwards printed uniformly with that edition. It"
1252,THE LIFE.,appears to have been the copy which Wordsworth himself used for
1253,THE LIFE.,"correcting, altering, and adding to the poems contained in it. As you"
1254,THE LIFE.,"have seen, in some of the poems the Alterations are very large,"
1255,THE LIFE.,amounting sometimes to a complete rewriting of considerable passages.
1256,THE LIFE.,Many of these alterations have been printed in subsequent editions;
1257,THE LIFE.,"some have not; two or three small poems, as far as I know, have not"
1258,THE LIFE.,been hitherto published. Much of the writing is Wordsworth's own; but
1259,THE LIFE.,"perhaps the larger portion is the hand-writing of others, one or more,"
1260,THE LIFE.,not familiar to me as Wordsworth's is.
1261,THE LIFE.,
1262,THE LIFE.,"""How the volumes came to be sold I do not know.... Such as they are,"
1263,THE LIFE.,"and whatever be their interest or value, you are, as far as I am"
1264,THE LIFE.,"concerned, heartily welcome to them; and I shall be glad indeed if"
1265,THE LIFE.,they add in the least degree to make your edition more worthy of the
1266,THE LIFE.,"great man for whom my admiration grows every day I live, and my deep"
1267,THE LIFE.,"gratitude to whom will cease only with my life, and my reason."""
1268,THE LIFE.,
1269,THE LIFE.,
1270,THE LIFE.,This precious copy of the edition of 1836-7 is now the property of Lady
1271,THE LIFE.,"Coleridge. I re-examined it in 1894, and added several readings, which I"
1272,THE LIFE.,"had omitted to note twelve years ago, when Lord Coleridge first showed"
1273,THE LIFE.,"it to me. I should add that, since the issue of the volumes of 1882-6,"
1274,THE LIFE.,many other MS. copies of individual Poems have come under my notice; and
1275,THE LIFE.,that every important variation of text in them is incorporated in this
1276,THE LIFE.,edition.
1277,THE LIFE.,
1278,THE LIFE.,As it is impossible to discover the precise year in which the suggested
1279,THE LIFE.,"alterations of text were written by Wordsworth, on the margin of the"
1280,THE LIFE.,"edition of 1836, they will be indicated, wherever they occur, by the"
1281,THE LIFE.,initial letter C. Comparatively few changes occur in the poems of early
1282,THE LIFE.,years.
1283,THE LIFE.,
1284,THE LIFE.,"A copy of the 1814 (quarto) edition of 'The Excursion', now in the"
1285,THE LIFE.,"possession of a grandson of the poet, the Rev. John Wordsworth, Gosforth"
1286,THE LIFE.,"Rectory, Cumberland--which was the copy Wordsworth kept at Rydal Mount"
1287,THE LIFE.,"for annotation and correction, much in the same way as he kept the"
1288,THE LIFE.,"edition of 1836-7--has also been kindly sent to me by its present owner,"
1289,THE LIFE.,"for examination and use in this edition; and, in it, I have found some"
1290,THE LIFE.,additional readings.
1291,THE LIFE.,
1292,THE LIFE.,
1293,THE LIFE.,"FOURTH. In the present edition all the Notes and Memoranda, explanatory"
1294,THE LIFE.,"of the Poems, which Wordsworth dictated to Miss Fenwick, are given in"
1295,THE LIFE.,"full. Miss Fenwick lived much at Rydal Mount, during the later years of"
1296,THE LIFE.,"the Poet's life; and it is to their friendship, and to her inducing"
1297,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth to dictate these Notes, that we owe most of the information"
1298,THE LIFE.,"we possess, as to the occasions and circumstances under which his poems"
1299,THE LIFE.,were composed. These notes were first made use of--although only in a
1300,THE LIFE.,"fragmentary manner--by the late Bishop of Lincoln, in the 'Memoirs' of"
1301,THE LIFE.,his uncle. They were afterwards incorporated in full in the edition of
1302,THE LIFE.,"1857, issued by Mr. Moxon, under the direction of Mr. Carter; and in the"
1303,THE LIFE.,centenary edition. They were subsequently printed in 'The Prose Works of
1304,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth', edited by Dr. Grosart; and in my edition of 1882-6. I am"
1305,THE LIFE.,"uncertain whether it was the original MS., written by Miss Fenwick, or"
1306,THE LIFE.,"the copy of it afterwards taken for Miss Quillinan, to which Dr. Grosart"
1307,THE LIFE.,"had access. The text of these Notes, as printed in the edition of 1857,"
1308,THE LIFE.,is certainly (in very many cases) widely different from what is given in
1309,THE LIFE.,'The Prose Works' of 1876. I have made many corrections--from the MS.
1310,THE LIFE.,which I have examined with care--of errors which exist in all previously
1311,THE LIFE.,"printed copies of these Notes, including my own."
1312,THE LIFE.,
1313,THE LIFE.,"What appears in this volume is printed from a MS., which Miss Quillinan"
1314,THE LIFE.,"gave me to examine and copy, and which she assured me was the original"
1315,THE LIFE.,one. The proper place for these Fenwick Notes is doubtless that which
1316,THE LIFE.,"was assigned to them by the editor of 1857, viz. before the poems which"
1317,THE LIFE.,they respectively illustrate.
1318,THE LIFE.,
1319,THE LIFE.,
1320,THE LIFE.,"FIFTH. Topographical Notes, explanatory of the allusions made by"
1321,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth to the localities in the English Lake District, and"
1322,THE LIFE.,"elsewhere, are added throughout the volumes. This has already been"
1323,THE LIFE.,"attempted to some extent by several writers, but a good deal more"
1324,THE LIFE.,"remains to be done; and I may repeat what I wrote on this subject, in"
1325,THE LIFE.,1878.
1326,THE LIFE.,
1327,THE LIFE.,"Many of Wordsworth's allusions to Place are obscure, and the exact"
1328,THE LIFE.,localities difficult to identify. It is doubtful if he cared whether
1329,THE LIFE.,they could be afterwards traced out or not; and in reference to one
1330,THE LIFE.,"particular rock, referred to in the ""Poems on the Naming of Places,"""
1331,THE LIFE.,"when asked by a friend to localise it, he declined; replying to the"
1332,THE LIFE.,"question, ""Yes, that--or any other that will suit!"" There is no doubt"
1333,THE LIFE.,"that, in many instances, his allusions to place are intentionally vague;"
1334,THE LIFE.,"and, in some of his most realistic passages, he avowedly weaves together"
1335,THE LIFE.,a description of localities remote from each other.
1336,THE LIFE.,
1337,THE LIFE.,"It is true that ""Poems of Places"" are not meant to be photographs; and"
1338,THE LIFE.,"were they simply to reproduce the features of a particular district, and"
1339,THE LIFE.,"be an exact transcript of reality, they would be literary photographs,"
1340,THE LIFE.,"and not poems. Poetry cannot, in the nature of things, be a mere"
1341,THE LIFE.,register of phenomena appealing to the eye or the ear. No imaginative
1342,THE LIFE.,"writer, however, in the whole range of English Literature, is so"
1343,THE LIFE.,peculiarly identified with locality as Wordsworth is; and there is not
1344,THE LIFE.,"one on the roll of poets, the appreciation of whose writings is more"
1345,THE LIFE.,aided by an intimate knowledge of the district in which he lived. The
1346,THE LIFE.,"wish to be able to identify his allusions to those places, which he so"
1347,THE LIFE.,"specially interpreted, is natural to every one who has ever felt the"
1348,THE LIFE.,spell of his genius; and it is indispensable to all who would know the
1349,THE LIFE.,"special charm of a region, which he described as ""a national property,"""
1350,THE LIFE.,"and of which he, beyond all other men, may be said to have effected the"
1351,THE LIFE.,"literary ""conveyance"" to posterity."
1352,THE LIFE.,
1353,THE LIFE.,But it has been asked--and will doubtless be asked again--what is the
1354,THE LIFE.,use of a minute identification of all these places? Is not the general
1355,THE LIFE.,"fact that Wordsworth described this district of mountain, vale, and"
1356,THE LIFE.,"mere, sufficient, without any further attempt at localisation? The"
1357,THE LIFE.,"question is more important, and has wider bearings, than appears upon"
1358,THE LIFE.,the surface.
1359,THE LIFE.,
1360,THE LIFE.,"It must be admitted, on the one hand, that the discovery of the precise"
1361,THE LIFE.,point in every local allusion is not necessary to an understanding or
1362,THE LIFE.,"appreciation of the Poems. But, it must be remembered, on the other"
1363,THE LIFE.,"hand, that Wordsworth was never contented with simply copying what he"
1364,THE LIFE.,saw in Nature. Of the 'Evening Walk'--written in his eighteenth year--he
1365,THE LIFE.,says that the plan of the poem
1366,THE LIFE.,
1367,THE LIFE.,"""has not been confined to a particular walk or an individual place; a"
1368,THE LIFE.,proof (of which I was unconscious at the time) of my unwillingness to
1369,THE LIFE.,submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and real circumstance.
1370,THE LIFE.,The country is idealised rather than described in any one of its local
1371,THE LIFE.,"aspects.""[13]"
1372,THE LIFE.,
1373,THE LIFE.,"Again, he says of the 'Lines written while Sailing in a Boat at Evening':"
1374,THE LIFE.,
1375,THE LIFE.,"""It was during a solitary walk on the banks of the Cam that I was"
1376,THE LIFE.,"first struck with this appearance, and applied it to my own feelings"
1377,THE LIFE.,"in the manner here expressed, changing the scene to the Thames, near"
1378,THE LIFE.,"Windsor""; [14]"
1379,THE LIFE.,
1380,THE LIFE.,"and of 'Guilt and Sorrow', he said,"
1381,THE LIFE.,
1382,THE LIFE.,"""To obviate some distraction in the minds of those who are well"
1383,THE LIFE.,"acquainted with Salisbury Plain, it may be proper to say, that of the"
1384,THE LIFE.,"features described as belonging to it, one or two are taken from other"
1385,THE LIFE.,"desolate parts of England."" [15]"
1386,THE LIFE.,
1387,THE LIFE.,"In 'The Excursion' he passes from Langdale to Grasmere, over to"
1388,THE LIFE.,"Patterdale, back to Grasmere, and again to Hawes Water, without warning;"
1389,THE LIFE.,"and even in the case of the ""Duddon Sonnets"" he introduces a description"
1390,THE LIFE.,taken direct from Rydal. Mr. Aubrey de Vere tells of a conversation he
1391,THE LIFE.,"had with Wordsworth, in which he vehemently condemned the"
1392,THE LIFE.,"ultra-realistic poet, who goes to Nature with"
1393,THE LIFE.,
1394,THE LIFE.,"""pencil and note-book, and jots down whatever strikes him most,"""
1395,THE LIFE.,"adding, ""Nature does not permit an inventory to be made of her charms!"
1396,THE LIFE.,He should have left his pencil and note-book at home; fixed his eye as
1397,THE LIFE.,"he walked with a reverent attention on all that surrounded him, and"
1398,THE LIFE.,taken all into a heart that could understand and enjoy. Afterwards he
1399,THE LIFE.,would have discovered that while much of what he had admired was
1400,THE LIFE.,"preserved to him, much was also most wisely obliterated. _That which"
1401,THE LIFE.,"remained, the picture surviving in his mind, would have presented the"
1402,THE LIFE.,"ideal and essential truth of the scene, and done so in large part by"
1403,THE LIFE.,"discarding much which, though in itself striking, was not"
1404,THE LIFE.,"characteristic._ In every scene, many of the most brilliant details"
1405,THE LIFE.,"are but accidental."""
1406,THE LIFE.,
1407,THE LIFE.,The two last sentences of this extract give admirable expression to one
1408,THE LIFE.,"feature of Wordsworth's interpretation of Nature. In the deepest poetry,"
1409,THE LIFE.,"as in the loftiest music,--in Wordsworth's lyrics as in Beethoven's"
1410,THE LIFE.,sonatas--it is by what they unerringly suggest and not by what they
1411,THE LIFE.,"exhaustively express that their truth and power are known. ""In what he"
1412,THE LIFE.,"leaves unsaid,"" wrote Schiller, ""I discover the master of style."" It"
1413,THE LIFE.,"depends, no doubt, upon the vision of the ""inward eye,"" and the"
1414,THE LIFE.,"reproductive power of the idealising mind, whether the result is a"
1415,THE LIFE.,"travesty of Nature, or the embodiment of a truth higher than Nature"
1416,THE LIFE.,"yields. On the other hand, it is equally certain that the identification"
1417,THE LIFE.,of localities casts a sudden light in many instances upon obscure
1418,THE LIFE.,"passages in a poem, and is by far the best commentary that can be given."
1419,THE LIFE.,"It is much to be able to compare the actual scene, with the ideal"
1420,THE LIFE.,creation suggested by it; as the latter was both Wordsworth's reading of
1421,THE LIFE.,"the text of Nature, and his interpretation of it. In his seventy-third"
1422,THE LIFE.,"year, he said, looking back on his 'Evening Walk', that there was not an"
1423,THE LIFE.,"image in the poem which he had not observed, and that he ""recollected"
1424,THE LIFE.,"the time and place where most of them were noted."" In the Fenwick notes,"
1425,THE LIFE.,"we constantly find him saying, ""the fact occurred strictly as recorded,"""
1426,THE LIFE.,"""the fact was as mentioned in the poem""; and the fact very often"
1427,THE LIFE.,involved the accessories of place.
1428,THE LIFE.,
1429,THE LIFE.,"Any one who has tried to trace out the allusions in the ""Poems on the"
1430,THE LIFE.,"Naming of Places,"" or to discover the site of ""Michael's Sheepfold,"" to"
1431,THE LIFE.,"identify ""Ghimmer Crag,"" or ""Thurston-Mere,""--not to speak of the"
1432,THE LIFE.,"individual ""rocks"" and ""recesses"" near Blea Tarn at the head of Little"
1433,THE LIFE.,"Langdale so minutely described in 'The Excursion',--will admit that"
1434,THE LIFE.,local commentary is an important aid to the understanding of Wordsworth.
1435,THE LIFE.,"If to read the 'Yew Trees' in Borrowdale itself,"
1436,THE LIFE.,
1437,THE LIFE.,in mute repose
1438,THE LIFE.,"To lie, and listen to the mountain flood"
1439,THE LIFE.,"Murmuring from Glaramara's inmost caves,"
1440,THE LIFE.,
1441,THE LIFE.,"to read 'The Brothers' in Ennerdale, or ""The Daffodils"" by the shore of"
1442,THE LIFE.,"Ullswater, gives a new significance to these ""poems of the imagination,"""
1443,THE LIFE.,a discovery of the obscurer allusions to place or scene will deepen our
1444,THE LIFE.,appreciation of those passages in which his idealism is most pronounced.
1445,THE LIFE.,"Every one knows Kirkstone Pass, Aira Force, Dungeon Ghyll, the Wishing"
1446,THE LIFE.,"Gate, and Helm Crag: many persons know the Glowworm Rock, and used to"
1447,THE LIFE.,"know the Rock of Names; but where is ""Emma's Dell""? or ""the meeting"
1448,THE LIFE.,"point of two highways,"" so characteristically described in the twelfth"
1449,THE LIFE.,book of 'The Prelude'? and who will fix the site of the pool in Rydal
1450,THE LIFE.,"Upper Park, immortalised in the poem 'To M. H.'? or identify ""Joanna's"
1451,THE LIFE.,"Rock""? Many of the places in the English Lake District are undergoing"
1452,THE LIFE.,"change, and every year the local allusions will be more difficult to"
1453,THE LIFE.,"trace. Perhaps the most interesting memorial of the poet which existed,"
1454,THE LIFE.,"viz. the ""Rock of Names,"" on the shore of Thirlmere, is now sunk under"
1455,THE LIFE.,the waters of a Manchester reservoir. Other memorials are perishing by
1456,THE LIFE.,"the wear and tear of time, the decay of old buildings, the alteration of"
1457,THE LIFE.,"roads, the cutting down of trees, and the modernising, or ""improving,"""
1458,THE LIFE.,of the district generally. All this is inevitable. But it is well that
1459,THE LIFE.,"many of the natural objects, over and around which the light of"
1460,THE LIFE.,"Wordsworth's genius lingers, are out of the reach of ""improvements,"" and"
1461,THE LIFE.,are indestructible even by machinery.
1462,THE LIFE.,
1463,THE LIFE.,If it be objected that several of the places which we try to
1464,THE LIFE.,identify--and which some would prefer to leave for ever undisturbed in
1465,THE LIFE.,"the realm of imagination--were purposely left obscure, it may be"
1466,THE LIFE.,replied that Death and Time have probably now removed all reasons for
1467,THE LIFE.,"reticence, especially in the case of those poems referring to domestic"
1468,THE LIFE.,"life and friendly ties. While an author is alive, or while those are"
1469,THE LIFE.,alive to whom he has made reference in the course of his allusions to
1470,THE LIFE.,"place, it may even be right that works designed for posterity should not"
1471,THE LIFE.,"be dealt with after the fashion of the modern ""interviewer."" But"
1472,THE LIFE.,"greatness has its penalties; and a ""fierce light"" ""beats around the"
1473,THE LIFE.,"throne"" of Genius, as well as round that of Empire. Moreover, all"
1474,THE LIFE.,experience shows that posterity takes a great and a growing interest in
1475,THE LIFE.,exact topographical illustrations of the works of great authors. The
1476,THE LIFE.,"labour recently bestowed upon the places connected with Shakespeare,"
1477,THE LIFE.,"Scott, and Burns sufficiently attests this."
1478,THE LIFE.,
1479,THE LIFE.,"The localities in Westmoreland, which are most permanently associated"
1480,THE LIFE.,"with Wordsworth, are these: Grasmere, where he lived during the years of"
1481,THE LIFE.,"his ""poetic prime,"" and where he is buried; Lower Easdale, where he"
1482,THE LIFE.,"passed so many days with his sister by the side of the brook, and on the"
1483,THE LIFE.,"terraces at Lancrigg, and where 'The Prelude' was dictated; Rydal Mount,"
1484,THE LIFE.,"where he spent the latter half of his life, and where he found one of"
1485,THE LIFE.,"the most perfect retreats in England; Great Langdale, and Blea Tarn at"
1486,THE LIFE.,"the head of Little Langdale, immortalised in 'The Excursion'; the upper"
1487,THE LIFE.,"end of Ullswater, and Kirkstone Pass; and all the mountain tracks and"
1488,THE LIFE.,"paths round Grasmere and Rydal, especially the old upper road between"
1489,THE LIFE.,"them, under Nab Scar, his favourite walk during his later years, where"
1490,THE LIFE.,"he ""composed hundreds of verses."" There is scarcely a rock or mountain"
1491,THE LIFE.,"summit, a stream or tarn, or even a well, a grove, or forest-side in all"
1492,THE LIFE.,"that neighbourhood, which is not imperishably identified with this poet,"
1493,THE LIFE.,"who at once interpreted them as they had never been interpreted before,"
1494,THE LIFE.,and added
1495,THE LIFE.,
1496,THE LIFE.,"the gleam,"
1497,THE LIFE.,"The light that never was, on sea or land,"
1498,THE LIFE.,"The consecration, and the Poet's dream."
1499,THE LIFE.,
1500,THE LIFE.,It may be worthy of note that Wordsworth himself sanctioned the
1501,THE LIFE.,principle of tracing out local allusions both by dictating the Fenwick
1502,THE LIFE.,"notes, and by republishing his Essay on the topography of the Lakes,"
1503,THE LIFE.,"along with the Duddon Sonnets, in 1820--and also, by itself, in"
1504,THE LIFE.,"1822--""from a belief that it would tend materially to illustrate"" his"
1505,THE LIFE.,poems.
1506,THE LIFE.,
1507,THE LIFE.,In this edition the topographical Notes usually follow the Poems to
1508,THE LIFE.,"which they refer. But in the case of the longer Poems, such as 'The"
1509,THE LIFE.,"Prelude', 'The Excursion', and others, it seems more convenient to print"
1510,THE LIFE.,"them at the foot of the page, than to oblige the reader to turn to the"
1511,THE LIFE.,end of the volume.
1512,THE LIFE.,
1513,THE LIFE.,From the accident of my having tried long ago--at Principal Shairp's
1514,THE LIFE.,"request--to do what he told me he wished to do, but had failed to carry"
1515,THE LIFE.,"out, I have been supposed, quite erroneously, to be an 'authority' on"
1516,THE LIFE.,"the subject of ""The English Lake District, as interpreted in the Poems"
1517,THE LIFE.,"of Wordsworth."" The latter, it is true, is the title of one of the books"
1518,THE LIFE.,"which I have written about Wordsworth: but, although I visited the Lakes"
1519,THE LIFE.,"in 1860,--""as a pilgrim resolute""--and have re-visited the district"
1520,THE LIFE.,"nearly every year for more than a quarter of a century, I may say that I"
1521,THE LIFE.,"have only a partial knowledge of it. Others, such as Canon Rawnsley, Mr."
1522,THE LIFE.,"Harry Goodwin, and Mr. Rix, for example, know many parts of it much"
1523,THE LIFE.,"better than I do; but, as I have often had to compare my own judgment"
1524,THE LIFE.,"with that of such experts as the late Dr. Cradock, Principal of"
1525,THE LIFE.,"Brasenose College, Oxford, and others, I may add that, when I differ"
1526,THE LIFE.,"from them, it has been only after a re-examination of their evidence, at"
1527,THE LIFE.,the localities themselves.
1528,THE LIFE.,
1529,THE LIFE.,
1530,THE LIFE.,"SIXTH. Several Poems, and fragments of poems, hitherto unpublished--or"
1531,THE LIFE.,"published in stray quarters, and in desultory fashion--will find a place"
1532,THE LIFE.,"in this edition; but I reserve these fragments, and place them all"
1533,THE LIFE.,"together, in an Appendix to the last volume of the ""Poetical Works."" If"
1534,THE LIFE.,"it is desirable to print these poems, in such an edition as this, it is"
1535,THE LIFE.,equally desirable to separate them from those which Wordsworth himself
1536,THE LIFE.,sanctioned in his final edition of 1849-50.
1537,THE LIFE.,
1538,THE LIFE.,Every great author in the Literature of the World--whether he lives to
1539,THE LIFE.,old age (when his judgment may possibly be less critical) or dies young
1540,THE LIFE.,(when it may be relatively more accurate)--should himself determine what
1541,THE LIFE.,"portions of his work ought, and what ought not to survive. At the same"
1542,THE LIFE.,"time,--while I do not presume to judge in the case of writers whom I"
1543,THE LIFE.,know less fully than I happen to know Wordsworth and his
1544,THE LIFE.,"contemporaries,--it seems clear that the very greatest men have"
1545,THE LIFE.,"occasionally erred as to what parts of their writings might, with most"
1546,THE LIFE.,"advantage, survive; and that they have even more frequently erred as to"
1547,THE LIFE.,"what MS. letters, etc.,--casting light on their contemporaries--should,"
1548,THE LIFE.,"or should not, be preserved. I am convinced, for example, that if the"
1549,THE LIFE.,Wordsworth household had not destroyed all the letters which Coleridge
1550,THE LIFE.,"sent to them, in the first decade of this century, the world would now"
1551,THE LIFE.,possess much important knowledge which is for ever lost. It may have
1552,THE LIFE.,"been wise, for reasons now unknown, to burn those letters, written by"
1553,THE LIFE.,Coleridge: but the students of the literature of the period would gladly
1554,THE LIFE.,have them now.
1555,THE LIFE.,
1556,THE LIFE.,"Passing from the question of the preservation of Letters, it is evident"
1557,THE LIFE.,that Wordsworth was very careful in distinguishing between the Verses
1558,THE LIFE.,"which he sent to Newspapers and Magazines, and those Poems which he"
1559,THE LIFE.,included in his published volumes. His anxiety on this point may be
1560,THE LIFE.,inferred from the way in which he more than once emphasised the fact of
1561,THE LIFE.,"republication, e.g. in 'Peter Bell' (1819) he put the following"
1562,THE LIFE.,"prefatory note to four sonnets, which had previously appeared in"
1563,THE LIFE.,"'Blackwood's Magazine', and which afterwards (1828) appeared in the"
1564,THE LIFE.,"'Poetical Album' of Alaric Watts, ""The following Sonnets having lately"
1565,THE LIFE.,"appeared in Periodical Publications are here reprinted."""
1566,THE LIFE.,
1567,THE LIFE.,"Some of the poems (or fragments of poems), included in the 'addenda' to"
1568,THE LIFE.,"Volume viii. of this edition, I would willingly have left out"
1569,THE LIFE.,"(especially the sonnet addressed to Miss Maria Williams); but, since"
1570,THE LIFE.,"they have appeared elsewhere, I feel justified in now reprinting even"
1571,THE LIFE.,"that trivial youthful effusion, signed ""Axiologus."" I rejoice, however,"
1572,THE LIFE.,"that there is no likelihood that the ""Somersetshire Tragedy"" will ever"
1573,THE LIFE.,see the light. When I told Wordsworth's successor in the Laureateship
1574,THE LIFE.,"that I had burned a copy of that poem, sent to me by one to whom it had"
1575,THE LIFE.,"been confided, his delight was great. It is the chronicle of a revolting"
1576,THE LIFE.,"crime, with nothing in the verse to warrant its publication. The only"
1577,THE LIFE.,"curious thing about it is that Wordsworth wrote it. With this exception,"
1578,THE LIFE.,"there is no reason why the fragments which he did not himself republish,"
1579,THE LIFE.,"and others which he published but afterwards suppressed, should not now"
1580,THE LIFE.,be printed. The suppression of some of these by the poet himself is as
1581,THE LIFE.,"unaccountable, as is his omission of certain stanzas in the earlier"
1582,THE LIFE.,"poems from their later versions. Even the Cambridge 'Installation Ode',"
1583,THE LIFE.,"which is so feeble, will be reprinted. [16] 'The Glowworm', which only"
1584,THE LIFE.,"appeared in the edition of 1807, will be republished in full. 'Andrew"
1585,THE LIFE.,"Jones',--also suppressed after appearing in ""Lyrical Ballads"" of 1800,"
1586,THE LIFE.,"1802, and 1805,--will be replaced, in like manner. The youthful 'School"
1587,THE LIFE.,"Exercise' written at Hawkshead, the translation from the 'Georgics' of"
1588,THE LIFE.,"Virgil, the poem addressed 'To the Queen' in 1846, will appear in their"
1589,THE LIFE.,chronological place in vol. viii. There are also a translation of some
1590,THE LIFE.,French stanzas by Francis Wrangham on 'The Birth of Love'-a poem
1591,THE LIFE.,"entitled 'The Eagle and the Dove', which was privately printed in a"
1592,THE LIFE.,"volume, consisting chiefly of French fragments, and called 'La petite"
1593,THE LIFE.,"Chouannerie, ou Historie d'un College Breton sous l'Empire'--a sonnet on"
1594,THE LIFE.,the rebuilding of a church at Cardiff--an Election Squib written during
1595,THE LIFE.,the Lowther and Brougham contest for the representation of the county of
1596,THE LIFE.,Cumberland in 1818--some stanzas written in the Visitors' Book at the
1597,THE LIFE.,"Ferry, Windermere, and other fragments. Then, since Wordsworth published"
1598,THE LIFE.,"some verses by his sister Dorothy in his own volumes, other unpublished"
1599,THE LIFE.,fragments by Miss Wordsworth may find a place in this edition. I do not
1600,THE LIFE.,"attach much importance, however, to the recovery of these unpublished"
1601,THE LIFE.,"poems. The truth is, as Sir Henry Taylor--himself a poet and critic of"
1602,THE LIFE.,"no mean order--remarked [17],"
1603,THE LIFE.,
1604,THE LIFE.,"""In these days, when a great man's path to posterity is likely to be"
1605,THE LIFE.,"more and more crowded, there is a tendency to create an obstruction,"
1606,THE LIFE.,in the desire to give an impulse. To gather about a man's work all the
1607,THE LIFE.,"details that can be found out about it is, in my opinion, to put a"
1608,THE LIFE.,"drag upon it; and, as of the Works, so of the Life."""
1609,THE LIFE.,
1610,THE LIFE.,The industrious labour of some editors in disinterring the trivial works
1611,THE LIFE.,of great men is not a commendable industry. All great writers have
1612,THE LIFE.,occasionally written trifles--this is true even of Shakespeare--and if
1613,THE LIFE.,"they wished them to perish, why should we seek to resuscitate them?"
1614,THE LIFE.,"Besides, this labour--whether due to the industry of admiring friends,"
1615,THE LIFE.,or to the ambition of the literary resurrectionist--is futile; because
1616,THE LIFE.,"the verdict of Time is sure, and posterity is certain to consign the"
1617,THE LIFE.,recovered trivialities to kindly oblivion. The question which should
1618,THE LIFE.,invariably present itself to the editor of the fragments of a great
1619,THE LIFE.,"writer is, ""_Can these bones live_?"" If they cannot, they had better"
1620,THE LIFE.,never see the light. Indeed the only good reason for reprinting the
1621,THE LIFE.,fragments which have been lost (because the author himself attached no
1622,THE LIFE.,"value to them), is that, in a complete collection of the works of a"
1623,THE LIFE.,"great man, some of them may have a biographic or psychological value."
1624,THE LIFE.,"But have we any right to reproduce, from an antiquarian motive, what--in"
1625,THE LIFE.,"a literary sense--is either trivial, or feeble, or sterile?"
1626,THE LIFE.,
1627,THE LIFE.,"We must, however, distinguish between what is suitable for an edition"
1628,THE LIFE.,"meant either to popularise an author, or to interpret him, and an"
1629,THE LIFE.,edition intended to bring together all that is worthy of preservation
1630,THE LIFE.,for posterity. There is great truth in what Mr. Arnold has lately said
1631,THE LIFE.,of Byron:
1632,THE LIFE.,
1633,THE LIFE.,"""I question whether by reading everything which he gives us, we are so"
1634,THE LIFE.,"likely to acquire an admiring sense, even of his variety and"
1635,THE LIFE.,"abundance, as by reading what he gives us at his happier moments."
1636,THE LIFE.,"Receive him absolutely without omission and compromise, follow his"
1637,THE LIFE.,"whole outpouring, stanza by stanza, and line by line, from the very"
1638,THE LIFE.,"commencement to the very end, and he is capable of being tiresome."""
1639,THE LIFE.,[18]
1640,THE LIFE.,
1641,THE LIFE.,"This is quite true; nevertheless, English literature demands a complete"
1642,THE LIFE.,"edition of all the works of Byron: and it may be safely predicted that,"
1643,THE LIFE.,"for weightier reasons and with greater urgency, it will continue to call"
1644,THE LIFE.,for the collected works of Wordsworth.
1645,THE LIFE.,
1646,THE LIFE.,It should also be noted that the fact of Wordsworth's having dictated to
1647,THE LIFE.,Miss Fenwick (so late as 1843) a stanza from 'The Convict' in his note
1648,THE LIFE.,"to 'The Lament of Mary Queen of Scots' (1817), justifies the inclusion"
1649,THE LIFE.,of the whole of that (suppressed) poem in such an edition as this.
1650,THE LIFE.,
1651,THE LIFE.,"The fact that Wordsworth did not republish all his Poems, in his final"
1652,THE LIFE.,"edition of 1849-50, is not conclusive evidence that he thought them"
1653,THE LIFE.,"unworthy of preservation, and reproduction. It must be remembered that"
1654,THE LIFE.,'The Prelude' itself was a posthumous publication; and also that the
1655,THE LIFE.,"fragmentary canto of 'The Recluse', entitled ""Home at Grasmere""--as well"
1656,THE LIFE.,"as the other canto published in 1886, and entitled (most prosaically)"
1657,THE LIFE.,"""Composed when a probability existed of our being obliged to quit Rydal"
1658,THE LIFE.,"Mount as a residence""--were not published by the poet himself. I am of"
1659,THE LIFE.,opinion that his omission of the stanzas beginning:
1660,THE LIFE.,
1661,THE LIFE.,"Among all lovely things my Love had been,"
1662,THE LIFE.,
1663,THE LIFE.,"and of the sonnet on his 'Voyage down the Rhine', was due to sheer"
1664,THE LIFE.,"forgetfulness of their existence. Few poets remember all their past,"
1665,THE LIFE.,"fugitive, productions. At the same time, there are other"
1666,THE LIFE.,"fragments,--written when he was experimenting with his theme, and when"
1667,THE LIFE.,"the inspiration of genius had forsaken him,--which it is unfortunate"
1668,THE LIFE.,that he did not himself destroy.
1669,THE LIFE.,
1670,THE LIFE.,"Among the Poems which Wordsworth suppressed, in his final edition, is"
1671,THE LIFE.,the Latin translation of 'The Somnambulist' by his son. This will be
1672,THE LIFE.,"republished, more especially as it was included by Wordsworth himself in"
1673,THE LIFE.,"the second edition of his ""Yarrow Revisited."""
1674,THE LIFE.,
1675,THE LIFE.,It may be well to mention the 'repetitions' which are inevitable in this
1676,THE LIFE.,"edition,"
1677,THE LIFE.,
1678,THE LIFE.,"(1) As already explained, those fragments of 'The Recluse'--which were"
1679,THE LIFE.,"issued in all the earlier volumes, and afterwards incorporated in 'The"
1680,THE LIFE.,Prelude'--are printed as they originally appeared.
1681,THE LIFE.,
1682,THE LIFE.,(2) Short Notes are extracted from Dorothy Wordsworth's 'Recollections
1683,THE LIFE.,"of a Tour made in Scotland' (1803), which illustrate the Poems composed"
1684,THE LIFE.,"during that Tour, while the whole text of that Tour will be printed in"
1685,THE LIFE.,full in subsequent volumes.
1686,THE LIFE.,
1687,THE LIFE.,"(3) Other fragments, including the lines beginning,"
1688,THE LIFE.,
1689,THE LIFE.,"Wisdom and Spirit of the universe,"
1690,THE LIFE.,
1691,THE LIFE.,"will be printed both by themselves in their chronological place, and in"
1692,THE LIFE.,"the longer poem of which they form a part, according to the original"
1693,THE LIFE.,plan of their author.
1694,THE LIFE.,
1695,THE LIFE.,"A detail, perhaps not too trivial to mention, is that, in this"
1696,THE LIFE.,edition--at the suggestion of several friends--I have followed the
1697,THE LIFE.,"example of Professor Dowden in his Aldine edition, and numbered the"
1698,THE LIFE.,lines of almost all the poems--even the sonnets. When I have not done
1699,THE LIFE.,"so, the reason will be obvious; viz. either the structure, or the"
1700,THE LIFE.,"brevity, of the poem. [19]"
1701,THE LIFE.,
1702,THE LIFE.,"In giving the date of each poem, I have used the word ""composed,"" rather"
1703,THE LIFE.,"than ""written,"" very much because Wordsworth himself,--and his sister,"
1704,THE LIFE.,"in her Journals--almost invariably use the word ""composed""; although he"
1705,THE LIFE.,"criticised the term as applied to the creation of a poem, as if it were"
1706,THE LIFE.,"a manufactured article. In his Chronological Table, Mr. Dowden adopts"
1707,THE LIFE.,"the word ""composed""; but, in his edition of the Poems, he has made use"
1708,THE LIFE.,"of the term"" written."" [20]"
1709,THE LIFE.,
1710,THE LIFE.,No notice (or almost none) of misprints in Wordsworth's own text is
1711,THE LIFE.,"taken, in the notes to this edition. Sometimes an error occurred, and"
1712,THE LIFE.,"was carried on through more than one edition, and corrected in the next:"
1713,THE LIFE.,"e.g., in 'The Childless Father', the editions of 1827, 1832, and 1836"
1714,THE LIFE.,have the line:
1715,THE LIFE.,
1716,THE LIFE.,"Fresh springs of green boxwood, not six months before."
1717,THE LIFE.,
1718,THE LIFE.,"In the 'errata' of the edition of 1836 this is corrected to ""fresh"
1719,THE LIFE.,"sprigs."" There are other 'errata', which remained in the edition of"
1720,THE LIFE.,"1849-50, e.g., in 'Rob Roy's Grave', ""Vools"" for ""Veols,"" and mistakes"
1721,THE LIFE.,"in quotations from other poets, such as ""invention"" for ""instruction,"""
1722,THE LIFE.,in Wither's poem on the Daisy. These are corrected without mention.
1723,THE LIFE.,
1724,THE LIFE.,"I should perhaps add that, while I have included, amongst the"
1725,THE LIFE.,"illustrative notes, extracts from Henry Crabb Robinson's 'Diary', etc.,"
1726,THE LIFE.,many of them are now published for the first time. These voluminous MSS.
1727,THE LIFE.,of Robinson's have been re-examined with care; and the reader who
1728,THE LIFE.,"compares the three volumes of the 'Diary', etc.--edited by Dr."
1729,THE LIFE.,"Sadler--with the extracts now printed from the original MS., will see"
1730,THE LIFE.,where sentences omitted by the original editor have been included.
1731,THE LIFE.,
1732,THE LIFE.,"As this edition proceeds, my debt to many--who have been so kind as to"
1733,THE LIFE.,put their Wordsworth MSS. and memoranda at my disposal--will be
1734,THE LIFE.,apparent.
1735,THE LIFE.,
1736,THE LIFE.,It is difficult to acknowledge duly my obligation to collectors of
1737,THE LIFE.,"autograph Letters--Mr. Morrison, the late Mr. Locker Lampson, the late"
1738,THE LIFE.,"Mr. Mackay, of the Grange, Trowbridge, and a score of others--but, I"
1739,THE LIFE.,"may say in general, that the kindness of those who possess Wordsworth"
1740,THE LIFE.,"MSS. in allowing me to examine them, has been a very genuine evidence of"
1741,THE LIFE.,"their interest in the Poet, and his work."
1742,THE LIFE.,
1743,THE LIFE.,"My special thanks are due to Mr. Gordon Wordsworth, who has, in the"
1744,THE LIFE.,"kindest manner and for many years, placed everything at my disposal,"
1745,THE LIFE.,which could further my labour on his grandfather's Works.
1746,THE LIFE.,
1747,THE LIFE.,"Finally, I wish to express the great debt I owe to the late Mr. J. Dykes"

2137,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,were noticed. I will confine myself to one instance:
2138,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,
2139,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"Waving his hat, the shepherd, from the vale,"
2140,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"Directs his winding dog the cliffs to scale,--"
2141,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"The dog, loud barking, 'mid the glittering rocks,"
2142,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"Hunts, where his master points, the intercepted flocks."
2143,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,
2144,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,I was an eye-witness of this for the first time while crossing the
2145,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"Pass of Dunmail Raise. Upon second thought, I will mention another"
2146,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,image:
2147,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,
2148,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"And, fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines"
2149,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"Its darkening boughs and leaves, in stronger lines."
2150,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,
2151,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"This is feebly and imperfectly expressed, but I recollect distinctly"
2152,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,the very spot where this first struck me. It was on the way between
2153,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"Hawkshead and Ambleside, and gave me extreme pleasure. The moment was"
2154,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,important in my poetical history; for I date from it my consciousness
2155,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,of the infinite variety of natural appearances which had been
2156,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"unnoticed by the poets of any age or country, so far as I was"
2157,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,acquainted with them; and I made a resolution to supply in some degree
2158,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,the deficiency. I could not have been at that time above fourteen
2159,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"years of age. The description of the swans, that follows, was taken"
2160,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"from the daily opportunities I had of observing their habits, not as"
2161,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"confined to the gentleman's park, but in a state of nature. There were"
2162,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"two pairs of them that divided the lake of Esthwaite, and its"
2163,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"in-and-out flowing streams, between them, never trespassing a single"
2164,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,yard upon each other's separate domain. They were of the old
2165,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"magnificent species, bearing in beauty and majesty about the same"
2166,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,relation to the Thames swan which that does to the goose. It was from
2167,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"the remembrance of those noble creatures, I took, thirty years after,"
2168,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,the picture of the swan which I have discarded from the poem of
2169,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"'Dion'. [B] While I was a schoolboy, the late Mr. Curwen introduced a"
2170,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"little fleet of these birds, but of the inferior species, to the lake"
2171,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,of Windermere. Their principal home was about his own island; but they
2172,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"sailed about into remote parts of the lake, and either from real or"
2173,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"imagined injury done to the adjoining fields, they were got rid of at"
2174,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"the request of the farmers and proprietors, but to the great regret of"
2175,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,all who had become attached to them from noticing their beauty and
2176,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,quiet habits. I will conclude my notice of this poem by observing that
2177,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,"the plan of it has not been confined to a particular walk, or an"
2178,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,individual place; a proof (of which I was unconscious at the time) of
2179,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,my unwillingness to submit the poetic spirit to the chains of fact and
2180,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,real circumstance. The country is idealised rather than described in
2181,ADDRESSED TO A YOUNG LADY,any one of its local aspects.--I. F.]

2438,THE POEM,"In these secluded vales, if village fame,"
2439,THE POEM,"Confirmed by hoary hairs, belief may claim;"
2440,THE POEM,"When up the hills, as now, retired the light,                    195"
2441,THE POEM,Strange apparitions mocked the shepherd's sight. [58]
2442,THE POEM,
2443,THE POEM,The form appears of one that spurs his steed
2444,THE POEM,Midway along the hill with desperate speed; [59]
2445,THE POEM,"Unhurt pursues his lengthened flight, while all"
2446,THE POEM,"Attend, at every stretch, his headlong fall.                     200"
2447,THE POEM,"Anon, appears a brave, a gorgeous show"
2448,THE POEM,Of horsemen-shadows moving to and fro; [60]
2449,THE POEM,"At intervals imperial banners stream, [61]"
2450,THE POEM,And now the van reflects the solar beam; [62]
2451,THE POEM,The rear through iron brown betrays a sullen gleam.              205
2452,THE POEM,"While silent stands the admiring crowd below,"
2453,THE POEM,"Silent the visionary warriors go,"
2454,THE POEM,Winding in ordered pomp their upward way [Q]
2455,THE POEM,Till the last banner of their [63] long array
2456,THE POEM,"Has disappeared, and every trace is fled                         210"
2457,THE POEM,Of splendour--save the beacon's spiry head
2458,THE POEM,Tipt with eve's latest gleam of burning red. [64]
2459,THE POEM,
2460,THE POEM,"Now, while the solemn evening shadows sail,"
2461,THE POEM,"On slowly-waving pinions, [65] down the vale;"
2462,THE POEM,"And, fronting the bright west, yon oak entwines                  215"
2463,THE POEM,"Its darkening boughs and leaves, in stronger lines; [66]"
2464,THE POEM,'Tis pleasant near the tranquil lake to stray [67]
2465,THE POEM,"Where, winding on along some secret bay, [68]"
2466,THE POEM,"The swan uplifts his chest, and backward flings"
2467,THE POEM,"His neck, a varying arch, between his towering wings:            220"
2468,THE POEM,The eye that marks the gliding creature sees
2469,THE POEM,"How graceful, pride can be, and how majestic, ease. [69]"
2470,THE POEM,
2471,THE POEM,While tender cares and mild domestic loves
2472,THE POEM,"With furtive watch pursue her as she moves,"
2473,THE POEM,"The female with a meeker charm succeeds,                         225"
2474,THE POEM,"And her brown little-ones around her leads,"
2475,THE POEM,"Nibbling the water lilies as they pass,"
2476,THE POEM,Or playing wanton with the floating grass.
2477,THE POEM,"She, in a mother's care, her beauty's pride"
2478,THE POEM,"Forgetting, calls the wearied to her side; [70]                  230"
2479,THE POEM,"Alternately they mount her back, and rest"
2480,THE POEM,Close by her mantling wings' embraces prest. [R]
2481,THE POEM,
2482,THE POEM,Long may they float upon this flood serene;
2483,THE POEM,"Theirs be these holms untrodden, still, and green,"
2484,THE POEM,"Where leafy shades fence off the blustering gale,                235"
2485,THE POEM,And breathes in peace the lily of the vale![71]
2486,THE POEM,"Yon isle, which feels not even the milk-maid's feet,"
2487,THE POEM,"Yet hears her song, ""by distance made more sweet,"" [72] [S]"
2488,THE POEM,"Yon isle conceals their home, their hut-like bower;"
2489,THE POEM,Green water-rushes overspread the floor; [73]                    240
2490,THE POEM,"Long grass and willows form the woven wall,"
2491,THE POEM,And swings above the roof the poplar tall.
2492,THE POEM,"Thence issuing often with unwieldy stalk,"
2493,THE POEM,They crush with broad black feet their flowery walk; [74]
2494,THE POEM,"Or, from the neighbouring water, hear at morn [75]               245"
2495,THE POEM,"The hound, the horse's tread, and mellow horn;"
2496,THE POEM,"Involve their serpent-necks in changeful rings,"
2497,THE POEM,"Rolled wantonly between their slippery wings,"
2498,THE POEM,"Or, starting up with noise and rude delight,"
2499,THE POEM,Force half upon the wave their cumbrous flight. [76]             250
2500,THE POEM,
2501,THE POEM,"Fair Swan! by all a mother's joys caressed,"
2502,THE POEM,"Haply some wretch has eyed, and called thee blessed;"
2503,THE POEM,"When with her infants, from some shady seat"
2504,THE POEM,"By the lake's edge, she rose--to face the noontide heat;"
2505,THE POEM,Or taught their limbs along the dusty road                       255
2506,THE POEM,A few short steps to totter with their load. [77]
2507,THE POEM,
2508,THE POEM,"I see her now, denied to lay her head,"
2509,THE POEM,"On cold blue nights, in hut or straw-built shed,"
2510,THE POEM,"Turn to a silent smile their sleepy cry,"
2511,THE POEM,By pointing to the gliding moon [78] on high.                    260
2512,THE POEM,
2513,THE POEM,"--[79] When low-hung clouds each star of summer hide,"
2514,THE POEM,"And fireless are the valleys far and wide,"
2515,THE POEM,Where the brook brawls along the public [80] road
2516,THE POEM,"Dark with bat-haunted ashes stretching broad,"
2517,THE POEM,[81] Oft has she taught them on her lap to lay                   265
2518,THE POEM,"The shining glow-worm; or, in heedless play,"
2519,THE POEM,"Toss it from hand to hand, disquieted;"
2520,THE POEM,"While others, not unseen, are free to shed"
2521,THE POEM,Green unmolested light upon their mossy bed. [82]
2522,THE POEM,
2523,THE POEM,"Oh! when the sleety showers her path assail,                   270"
2524,THE POEM,And like a torrent roars the headstrong gale; [83]
2525,THE POEM,"No more her breath can thaw their fingers cold,"
2526,THE POEM,Their frozen arms her neck no more can fold;
2527,THE POEM,"[84] Weak roof a cowering form two babes to shield,"
2528,THE POEM,And faint the fire a dying heart can yield!                      275
2529,THE POEM,"Press the sad kiss, fond mother! vainly fears"
2530,THE POEM,Thy flooded cheek to wet them with its tears;
2531,THE POEM,"[85] No tears can chill them, and no bosom warms,"
2532,THE POEM,"Thy breast their death-bed, coffined in thine arms!"
2533,THE POEM,
2534,THE POEM,"Sweet are the sounds that mingle from afar,                    280"
2535,THE POEM,"Heard by calm lakes, as peeps the folding star,"
2536,THE POEM,"Where the duck dabbles 'mid the rustling sedge,"
2537,THE POEM,"And feeding pike starts from the water's edge,"
2538,THE POEM,"Or the swan stirs the reeds, his neck and bill"
2539,THE POEM,"Wetting, that drip upon the water still;                         285"
2540,THE POEM,"And heron, as resounds the trodden shore,"
2541,THE POEM,"Shoots upward, darting his long neck before."
2542,THE POEM,[86]
2543,THE POEM,"Now, with religious awe, the farewell light"
2544,THE POEM,Blends with the solemn colouring of night; [87]
2545,THE POEM,"'Mid groves of clouds that crest the mountain's brow,            290"
2546,THE POEM,"And round the west's proud lodge their shadows throw,"
2547,THE POEM,"Like Una [T] shining on her gloomy way,"
2548,THE POEM,The half-seen form of Twilight roams astray;
2549,THE POEM,"Shedding, through paly loop-holes mild and small,"
2550,THE POEM,Gleams that upon the lake's still bosom fall; [88]               295
2551,THE POEM,[89] Soft o'er the surface creep those lustres pale
2552,THE POEM,Tracking the motions of the fitful gale. [90]
2553,THE POEM,With restless interchange at once the bright
2554,THE POEM,"Wins on the shade, the shade upon the light."
2555,THE POEM,No favoured eye was e'er allowed to gaze                         300
2556,THE POEM,On lovelier spectacle in faery days;
2557,THE POEM,"When gentle Spirits urged a sportive chase,"
2558,THE POEM,Brushing with lucid wands the water's face;
2559,THE POEM,"While music, stealing round the glimmering deeps,"
2560,THE POEM,Charmed the tall circle of the enchanted steeps.                 305
2561,THE POEM,--The lights are vanished from the watery plains:
2562,THE POEM,No wreck of all the pageantry remains.
2563,THE POEM,Unheeded night has overcome the vales:
2564,THE POEM,On the dark earth the wearied vision fails;
2565,THE POEM,"The latest lingerer of the forest train,                         310"
2566,THE POEM,"The lone black fir, forsakes the faded plain;"
2567,THE POEM,"Last evening sight, the cottage smoke, no more,"
2568,THE POEM,"Lost in the thickened darkness, glimmers hoar;"
2569,THE POEM,"And, towering from the sullen dark-brown mere,"
2570,THE POEM,"Like a black wall, the mountain-steeps appear. [91]              315"
2571,THE POEM,
2572,THE POEM,--Now o'er the soothed accordant heart we feel
2573,THE POEM,"A sympathetic twilight slowly steal,"
2574,THE POEM,"And ever, as we fondly muse, we find"
2575,THE POEM,The soft gloom deepening on the tranquil mind.
2576,THE POEM,"Stay! pensive, sadly-pleasing visions, stay!                     320"
2577,THE POEM,"Ah no! as fades the vale, they fade away:"
2578,THE POEM,"Yet still the tender, vacant gloom remains;"
2579,THE POEM,Still the cold cheek its shuddering tear retains.
2580,THE POEM,
2581,THE POEM,"The bird, who ceased, with fading light, to thread"
2582,THE POEM,"Silent the hedge or steamy rivulet's bed, [92]                   325"
2583,THE POEM,From his grey re-appearing tower shall soon
2584,THE POEM,"Salute with gladsome note the rising moon,"
2585,THE POEM,"While with a hoary light she frosts the ground,"
2586,THE POEM,And pours a deeper blue to Aether's bound;
2587,THE POEM,"Pleased, as she moves, her pomp of clouds to fold                330"
2588,THE POEM,"In robes of azure, fleecy-white, and gold. [93]"
2589,THE POEM,
2590,THE POEM,"Above yon eastern hill, [94] where darkness broods"
2591,THE POEM,"O'er all its vanished dells, and lawns, and woods;"
2592,THE POEM,"Where but a mass of shade the sight can trace,"
2593,THE POEM,"Even now she shows, half-veiled, her lovely face: [95]           335"
2594,THE POEM,"Across [96] the gloomy valley flings her light,"
2595,THE POEM,Far to the western slopes with hamlets white;
2596,THE POEM,"And gives, where woods the chequered upland strew,"
2597,THE POEM,"To the green corn of summer, autumn's hue."
2598,THE POEM,
2599,THE POEM,"Thus Hope, first pouring from her blessed horn                   340"
2600,THE POEM,"Her dawn, far lovelier than the moon's own morn,"
2601,THE POEM,"'Till higher mounted, strives in vain to cheer"
2602,THE POEM,"The weary hills, impervious, blackening near;"
2603,THE POEM,"Yet does she still, undaunted, throw the while"
2604,THE POEM,On darling spots remote her tempting smile.                      345
2605,THE POEM,
2606,THE POEM,"Even now she decks for me a distant scene,"
2607,THE POEM,(For dark and broad the gulf of time between)
2608,THE POEM,"Gilding that cottage with her fondest ray,"
2609,THE POEM,"(Sole bourn, sole wish, sole object of my way;                   350"
2610,THE POEM,How fair its lawns and sheltering [97] woods appear!
2611,THE POEM,How sweet its streamlet murmurs in mine ear!)
2612,THE POEM,"Where we, my Friend, to happy [98] days shall rise,"
2613,THE POEM,'Till our small share of hardly-paining sighs
2614,THE POEM,(For sighs will ever trouble human breath)                       355
2615,THE POEM,Creep hushed into the tranquil breast of death.
2616,THE POEM,
2617,THE POEM,"But now the clear bright Moon her zenith gains,"
2618,THE POEM,"And, rimy without speck, extend the plains:"
2619,THE POEM,The deepest cleft the mountain's front displays [99]
2620,THE POEM,Scarce hides a shadow from her searching rays;                   360
2621,THE POEM,From the dark-blue faint silvery threads divide
2622,THE POEM,"The hills, while gleams below the azure tide;"
2623,THE POEM,Time softly treads; throughout the landscape breathes
2624,THE POEM,"A peace enlivened, not disturbed, by wreaths"
2625,THE POEM,"Of charcoal-smoke, that o'er the fallen wood,                    365"
2626,THE POEM,"Steal down the hill, and spread along the flood.[100]"
2627,THE POEM,
2628,THE POEM,"The song of mountain-streams, unheard by day,"
2629,THE POEM,"Now hardly heard, beguiles my homeward way. [U]"
2630,THE POEM,"Air listens, like the sleeping water, still,"
2631,THE POEM,"To catch the spiritual music of the hill, [101]                  370"
2632,THE POEM,"Broke only by the slow clock tolling deep,"
2633,THE POEM,"Or shout that wakes the ferry-man from sleep,"
2634,THE POEM,"The echoed hoof nearing the distant shore,"
2635,THE POEM,The boat's first motion--made with dashing oar; [102]
2636,THE POEM,"Sound of closed gate, across the water borne,                    375"
2637,THE POEM,Hurrying the timid [103] hare through rustling corn;
2638,THE POEM,The sportive outcry of the mocking owl; [104]
2639,THE POEM,And at long intervals the mill-dog's howl;
2640,THE POEM,The distant forge's swinging thump profound;
2641,THE POEM,"Or yell, in the deep woods, of lonely hound.                     380"

4412,THE POEM,"Or, from the bending rocks, obtrusive cling,                    85"
4413,THE POEM,And o'er the whitened wave their shadows fling--
4414,THE POEM,"The pathway leads, as round the steeps it twines; [21]"
4415,THE POEM,And Silence loves its purple roof of vines.
4416,THE POEM,"The loitering traveller [22] hence, at evening, sees"
4417,THE POEM,From rock-hewn steps the sail between the trees;                90
4418,THE POEM,"Or marks, 'mid opening cliffs, fair dark-eyed maids"
4419,THE POEM,Tend the small harvest of their garden glades;
4420,THE POEM,Or stops the solemn mountain-shades to view
4421,THE POEM,"Stretch o'er the pictured mirror broad and blue,"
4422,THE POEM,"And track the yellow lights from steep to steep,                95"
4423,THE POEM,As up the opposing hills they slowly creep. [23]
4424,THE POEM,"Aloft, here, half a village shines, arrayed"
4425,THE POEM,In golden light; [24] half hides itself in shade:
4426,THE POEM,"While, from amid the darkened roofs, the spire,"
4427,THE POEM,"Restlessly flashing, seems to mount like fire: [25]            100"
4428,THE POEM,"There, all unshaded, blazing forests throw"
4429,THE POEM,Rich golden verdure on the lake [26] below.
4430,THE POEM,"Slow glides the sail along the illumined shore,"
4431,THE POEM,And steals into the shade the lazy oar;
4432,THE POEM,"Soft bosoms breathe around contagious sighs,                   105"
4433,THE POEM,And amorous music on the water dies.
4434,THE POEM,
4435,THE POEM,"How blest, delicious scene! the eye that greets"
4436,THE POEM,"Thy open beauties, or thy lone retreats;"
4437,THE POEM,Beholds the unwearied sweep of wood that scales
4438,THE POEM,Thy cliffs; the endless waters of thy vales; [27]              110
4439,THE POEM,"Thy lowly cots that sprinkle all the shore, [28]"
4440,THE POEM,Each with its [29] household boat beside the door;
4441,THE POEM,[30] Thy torrents shooting from the clear-blue sky;
4442,THE POEM,"Thy towns, that cleave, like swallows' nests, on high; [31]"
4443,THE POEM,That glimmer hoar in eve's last light descried                 115
4444,THE POEM,"Dim from the twilight water's shaggy side,"
4445,THE POEM,Whence lutes and voices down the enchanted woods
4446,THE POEM,"Steal, and compose the oar-forgotten floods;"
4447,THE POEM,"[32]--Thy lake, that, streaked or dappled, blue or grey,"
4448,THE POEM,'Mid smoking woods gleams hid from morning's ray [33]          120
4449,THE POEM,"Slow-travelling down the western hills, to' enfold [34]"
4450,THE POEM,Its green-tinged margin in a blaze of gold;
4451,THE POEM,"Thy glittering steeples, whence the matin bell"
4452,THE POEM,"Calls forth the woodman from his desert cell,"
4453,THE POEM,And quickens the blithe sound of oars that pass                125
4454,THE POEM,"Along the steaming lake, to early mass. [35]"
4455,THE POEM,But now farewell to each and all--adieu
4456,THE POEM,"To every charm, and last and chief to you, [36]"
4457,THE POEM,Ye lovely maidens that in noontide shade
4458,THE POEM,Rest near your little plots of wheaten glade; [37]             130
4459,THE POEM,"To all that binds [38] the soul in powerless trance,"
4460,THE POEM,"Lip-dewing song, and ringlet-tossing dance;"
4461,THE POEM,Where sparkling eyes and breaking smiles illume
4462,THE POEM,The sylvan cabin's lute-enlivened gloom.
4463,THE POEM,--Alas! the very murmur of the streams                         135
4464,THE POEM,"Breathes o'er the failing soul voluptuous dreams,"
4465,THE POEM,"While Slavery, forcing the sunk mind to dwell"
4466,THE POEM,"On joys that might disgrace the captive's cell,"
4467,THE POEM,"Her shameless timbrel shakes on Como's marge,"
4468,THE POEM,And lures [39] from bay to bay the vocal barge.                140
4469,THE POEM,
4470,THE POEM,Yet are thy softer arts with power indued
4471,THE POEM,To soothe and cheer the poor man's solitude.
4472,THE POEM,"By silent cottage-doors, the peasant's home"
4473,THE POEM,"Left vacant for the day, I loved to roam. [40]"
4474,THE POEM,But once I pierced the mazes of a wood                         145
4475,THE POEM,In which a cabin undeserted stood; [41]
4476,THE POEM,There an old man an olden measure scanned
4477,THE POEM,On a rude viol touched with withered hand. [42]
4478,THE POEM,As lambs or fawns in April clustering lie [43]
4479,THE POEM,"Under a hoary oak's thin canopy,                               150"
4480,THE POEM,"Stretched at his feet, with stedfast upward eye,"
4481,THE POEM,His children's children listened to the sound; [44]
4482,THE POEM,--A Hermit with his family around!
4483,THE POEM,
4484,THE POEM,But let us hence; for fair Locarno smiles
4485,THE POEM,Embowered in walnut slopes and citron isles:                   155
4486,THE POEM,"Or seek at eve the banks of Tusa's stream,"
4487,THE POEM,"Where, [45] 'mid dim towers and woods, her [M] waters gleam."
4488,THE POEM,"From the bright wave, in solemn gloom, retire"
4489,THE POEM,"The dull-red steeps, and, darkening still, aspire"
4490,THE POEM,To where afar rich orange lustres glow                         160
4491,THE POEM,"Round undistinguished clouds, and rocks, and snow:"
4492,THE POEM,"Or, led where Via Mala's chasms confine"
4493,THE POEM,"The indignant waters of the infant Rhine,"
4494,THE POEM,"Hang o'er the abyss, whose else impervious gloom [46]"
4495,THE POEM,His burning eyes with fearful light illume.                    165
4496,THE POEM,
4497,THE POEM,"The mind condemned, without reprieve, to go"
4498,THE POEM,"O'er life's long deserts with its charge of woe,"
4499,THE POEM,With sad congratulation joins the train
4500,THE POEM,Where beasts and men together o'er the plain
4501,THE POEM,Move on--a mighty caravan of pain:                             170
4502,THE POEM,"Hope, strength, and courage, social suffering brings,"
4503,THE POEM,Freshening the wilderness with shades and springs.
4504,THE POEM,--There be whose lot far otherwise is cast:
4505,THE POEM,"Sole human tenant of the piny waste, [47]"
4506,THE POEM,"By choice or doom a gipsy wanders here,                        175"
4507,THE POEM,A nursling babe her only comforter;
4508,THE POEM,"Lo, where she sits beneath yon shaggy rock,"
4509,THE POEM,A cowering shape half hid in curling smoke! [48]
4510,THE POEM,
4511,THE POEM,When lightning among clouds and mountain-snows
4512,THE POEM,"Predominates, and darkness comes and goes,                     180"
4513,THE POEM,"And the fierce torrent, at the flashes broad"
4514,THE POEM,"Starts, like a horse, beside the glaring road--"
4515,THE POEM,She seeks a covert from the battering shower
4516,THE POEM,"In the roofed bridge [N]; the bridge, in that dread hour,"
4517,THE POEM,Itself all trembling at the torrent's power. [49]              185
4518,THE POEM,
4519,THE POEM,"Nor is she more at ease on some _still_ night,"
4520,THE POEM,When not a star supplies the comfort of its light;
4521,THE POEM,Only the waning moon hangs dull and red
4522,THE POEM,"Above a melancholy mountain's head,"
4523,THE POEM,"Then sets. In total gloom the Vagrant sighs,                   190"
4524,THE POEM,"Stoops her sick head, and shuts her weary eyes;"
4525,THE POEM,"Or on her fingers counts the distant clock,"
4526,THE POEM,"Or, to the drowsy crow of midnight cock,"
4527,THE POEM,"Listens, or quakes while from the forest's gulf"
4528,THE POEM,Howls near and nearer yet the famished wolf. [50]              195
4529,THE POEM,
4530,THE POEM,From the green vale of Urseren smooth and wide
4531,THE POEM,"Descend we now, the maddened Reuss our guide; [51]"
4532,THE POEM,"By rocks that, shutting out the blessed day,"
4533,THE POEM,Cling tremblingly to rocks as loose as they;
4534,THE POEM,"By cells [P] upon whose image, while he prays,                 200"
4535,THE POEM,The kneeling peasant scarcely dares to gaze;
4536,THE POEM,"By many a votive death-cross [Q] planted near,"
4537,THE POEM,"And watered duly with the pious tear,"
4538,THE POEM,That faded silent from the upward eye
4539,THE POEM,Unmoved with each rude form of peril nigh; [52]                205
4540,THE POEM,Fixed on the anchor left by Him who saves
4541,THE POEM,"Alike in whelming snows, and roaring waves."
4542,THE POEM,
4543,THE POEM,But soon a peopled region on the sight
4544,THE POEM,Opens--a little world of calm delight; [53]
4545,THE POEM,"Where mists, suspended on the expiring gale,                   210"
4546,THE POEM,"Spread roof like o'er the deep secluded vale, [54]"
4547,THE POEM,"And beams of evening slipping in between,"
4548,THE POEM,Gently illuminate a sober scene:--[55]
4549,THE POEM,"Here, on the brown wood-cottages [R] they sleep, [56]"
4550,THE POEM,"There, over rock or sloping pasture creep. [57]                215"
4551,THE POEM,"On as we journey, in clear view displayed,"
4552,THE POEM,The still vale lengthens underneath its shade
4553,THE POEM,Of low-hung vapour: on the freshened mead
4554,THE POEM,The green light sparkles;--the dim bowers recede. [58]
4555,THE POEM,"While pastoral pipes and streams the landscape lull,           220"
4556,THE POEM,"And bells of passing mules that tinkle dull,"
4557,THE POEM,In solemn shapes before the admiring eye
4558,THE POEM,"Dilated hang the misty pines on high,"
4559,THE POEM,"Huge convent domes with pinnacles and towers,"
4560,THE POEM,And antique castles seen through gleamy [59] showers.          225
4561,THE POEM,
4562,THE POEM,"From such romantic dreams, my soul, awake!"
4563,THE POEM,"To sterner pleasure, where, by Uri's lake"
4564,THE POEM,"In Nature's pristine majesty outspread,"
4565,THE POEM,Winds neither road nor path for foot to tread: [60]
4566,THE POEM,"The rocks rise naked as a wall, or stretch,                    230"
4567,THE POEM,"Far o'er the water, hung with groves of beech; [61]"
4568,THE POEM,"Aerial pines from loftier steeps ascend,"
4569,THE POEM,Nor stop but where creation seems to end. [62]
4570,THE POEM,"Yet here and there, if 'mid the savage scene"
4571,THE POEM,"Appears a scanty plot of smiling green,                        235"
4572,THE POEM,Up from the lake a zigzag path will creep
4573,THE POEM,To reach a small wood-hut hung boldly on the steep. [63]
4574,THE POEM,--Before those thresholds (never can they know [64]
4575,THE POEM,"The face of traveller passing to and fro,)"
4576,THE POEM,"No peasant leans upon his pole, to tell                        240"
4577,THE POEM,For whom at morning tolled the funeral bell;
4578,THE POEM,"Their watch-dog ne'er his angry bark foregoes,"
4579,THE POEM,Touched by the beggar's moan of human woes;
4580,THE POEM,The shady porch ne'er offered a cool seat
4581,THE POEM,To pilgrims overcome by summer's heat. [65]                    245
4582,THE POEM,Yet thither the world's business finds its way
4583,THE POEM,"At times, and tales unsought beguile the day,"
4584,THE POEM,"And _there_ are those fond thoughts which Solitude, [66]"
4585,THE POEM,"However stern, is powerless to exclude. [67]"
4586,THE POEM,There doth the maiden watch her lover's sail                   250
4587,THE POEM,"Approaching, and upbraid the tardy gale;"
4588,THE POEM,"At midnight listens till his parting oar,"
4589,THE POEM,"And its last echo, can be heard no more. [68]"
4590,THE POEM,
4591,THE POEM,"And what if ospreys, cormorants, herons cry,"
4592,THE POEM,"Amid tempestuous vapours driving by, [69]                      255"
4593,THE POEM,Or hovering over wastes too bleak to rear
4594,THE POEM,"That common growth of earth, the foodful ear; [70]"
4595,THE POEM,"Where the green apple shrivels on the spray,"
4596,THE POEM,And pines the unripened pear in summer's kindliest ray; [71]
4597,THE POEM,Contentment shares the desolate domain [72]                    260
4598,THE POEM,"With Independence, child of high Disdain."
4599,THE POEM,"Exulting 'mid the winter of the skies,"
4600,THE POEM,"Shy as the jealous chamois, Freedom flies,"
4601,THE POEM,"And grasps by fits her sword, and often eyes;"
4602,THE POEM,"And sometimes, as from rock to rock she bounds                 265"
4603,THE POEM,"The Patriot nymph starts at imagined sounds,"
4604,THE POEM,"And, wildly pausing, oft she hangs aghast,"
4605,THE POEM,Whether some old Swiss air hath checked her haste
4606,THE POEM,Or thrill of Spartan fife is caught between the blast. [73]
4607,THE POEM,
4608,THE POEM,"Swoln with incessant rains from hour to hour, [74]           270"
4609,THE POEM,All day the floods a deepening murmur pour:
4610,THE POEM,"The sky is veiled, and every cheerful sight:"
4611,THE POEM,Dark is the region as with coming night;
4612,THE POEM,But what a sudden burst of overpowering light!
4613,THE POEM,"Triumphant on the bosom of the storm,                          275"
4614,THE POEM,Glances the wheeling eagle's glorious form![75]
4615,THE POEM,"Eastward, in long perspective glittering, shine"
4616,THE POEM,The wood-crowned cliffs that o'er the lake recline;
4617,THE POEM,"Those lofty cliffs a hundred streams unfold, [76]"
4618,THE POEM,At once to pillars turned that flame with gold:                280
4619,THE POEM,"Behind his sail the peasant shrinks, to shun"
4620,THE POEM,"The _west_, [77] that burns like one dilated sun,"
4621,THE POEM,"A crucible of mighty compass, felt"
4622,THE POEM,"By mountains, glowing till they seem to melt. [78]"
4623,THE POEM,
4624,THE POEM,"But, lo! the boatman, overawed, before                       285"
4625,THE POEM,The pictured fane of Tell suspends his oar;
4626,THE POEM,"Confused the Marathonian tale appears,"
4627,THE POEM,While his eyes sparkle with heroic tears. [79]
4628,THE POEM,"And who, that walks where men of ancient days"
4629,THE POEM,"Have wrought with godlike arm the deeds of praise,             290"
4630,THE POEM,"Feels not the spirit of the place control,"
4631,THE POEM,Or rouse [80] and agitate his labouring soul?
4632,THE POEM,"Say, who, by thinking on Canadian hills,"
4633,THE POEM,"Or wild Aosta lulled by Alpine rills,"
4634,THE POEM,"On Zutphen's plain; or on that highland dell,                  295"
4635,THE POEM,"Through which rough Garry cleaves his way, can tell"
4636,THE POEM,What high resolves exalt the tenderest thought
4637,THE POEM,"Of him whom passion rivets to the spot, [81]"
4638,THE POEM,"Where breathed the gale that caught Wolfe's happiest sigh,"
4639,THE POEM,And the last sunbeam fell on Bayard's eye;                     300
4640,THE POEM,"Where bleeding Sidney from the cup retired,"
4641,THE POEM,"And glad Dundee in ""faint huzzas"" [S] expired?"
4642,THE POEM,
4643,THE POEM,But now with other mind I stand alone
4644,THE POEM,"Upon the summit of this naked cone,"
4645,THE POEM,And watch the fearless chamois-hunter chase                    305
4646,THE POEM,"His prey, through tracts abrupt of desolate space, [82]"
4647,THE POEM,[T] Through vacant worlds where Nature never gave
4648,THE POEM,"A brook to murmur or a bough to wave,"
4649,THE POEM,Which unsubstantial Phantoms sacred keep;
4650,THE POEM,"Thro' worlds where Life, and Voice, and Motion sleep;          310"
4651,THE POEM,"Where silent Hours their death-like sway extend,"
4652,THE POEM,"Save when the avalanche breaks loose, to rend"
4653,THE POEM,"Its way with uproar, till the ruin, drowned"
4654,THE POEM,"In some dense wood or gulf of snow profound,"
4655,THE POEM,Mocks the dull ear of Time with deaf abortive sound. [83]      315
4656,THE POEM,"--'Tis his, while wandering on from height to height,"
4657,THE POEM,To see a planet's pomp and steady light
4658,THE POEM,In the least star of scarce-appearing night;
4659,THE POEM,"While the pale moon moves near him, on the bound"
4660,THE POEM,"Of ether, shining with diminished round, [84]                  320"
4661,THE POEM,"And far and wide the icy summits blaze,"
4662,THE POEM,Rejoicing in the glory of her rays:
4663,THE POEM,"To him the day-star glitters small and bright,"
4664,THE POEM,"Shorn of its beams, insufferably white,"
4665,THE POEM,"And he can look beyond the sun, and view                       325"
4666,THE POEM,Those fast-receding depths of sable blue
4667,THE POEM,Flying till vision can no more pursue! [85]
4668,THE POEM,"--At once bewildering mists around him close,"
4669,THE POEM,And cold and hunger are his least of woes;
4670,THE POEM,"The Demon of the snow, with angry roar                         330"
4671,THE POEM,"Descending, shuts for aye his prison door."
4672,THE POEM,Soon with despair's whole weight his spirits sink;
4673,THE POEM,"Bread has he none, the snow must be his drink;"
4674,THE POEM,"And, ere his eyes can close upon the day, [86]"
4675,THE POEM,The eagle of the Alps o'ershades her prey.                     335
4676,THE POEM,
4677,THE POEM,"Now couch thyself where, heard with fear afar, [87]"
4678,THE POEM,Thunders through echoing pines the headlong Aar;
4679,THE POEM,Or rather stay to taste the mild delights
4680,THE POEM,Of pensive Underwalden's [U] pastoral heights.
4681,THE POEM,--Is there who 'mid these awful wilds has seen                 340
4682,THE POEM,The native Genii walk the mountain green?
4683,THE POEM,"Or heard, while other worlds their charms reveal,"
4684,THE POEM,Soft music o'er [88] the aërial summit steal?
4685,THE POEM,"While o'er the desert, answering every close,"
4686,THE POEM,Rich steam of sweetest perfume comes and goes.                 345
4687,THE POEM,--And sure there is a secret Power that reigns
4688,THE POEM,"Here, where no trace of man the spot profanes,"
4689,THE POEM,"Nought but the _chalets_, [V] flat and bare, on high"
4690,THE POEM,Suspended 'mid the quiet of the sky;
4691,THE POEM,"Or distant herds that pasturing upward creep,                  350"
4692,THE POEM,"And, not untended, climb the dangerous steep. [89]"
4693,THE POEM,How still! no irreligious sound or sight
4694,THE POEM,Rouses the soul from her severe delight.
4695,THE POEM,An idle voice the sabbath region fills
4696,THE POEM,"Of Deep that calls to Deep across the hills,                   355"
4697,THE POEM,And with that voice accords the soothing sound [90]
4698,THE POEM,"Of drowsy bells, for ever tinkling round;"
4699,THE POEM,Faint wail of eagle melting into blue
4700,THE POEM,"Beneath the cliffs, and pine-woods' steady _sugh_; [W]"
4701,THE POEM,The solitary heifer's deepened low;                            360
4702,THE POEM,"Or rumbling, heard remote, of falling snow."
4703,THE POEM,"All motions, sounds, and voices, far and nigh,"
4704,THE POEM,Blend in a music of tranquillity; [91]
4705,THE POEM,"Save when, a stranger seen below [92] the boy"
4706,THE POEM,Shouts from the echoing hills with savage joy.                 365
4707,THE POEM,
4708,THE POEM,"When, from the sunny breast of open seas,"
4709,THE POEM,"And bays with myrtle fringed, the southern breeze"
4710,THE POEM,Comes on to gladden April with the sight
4711,THE POEM,Of green isles widening on each snow-clad height; [93]
4712,THE POEM,"When shouts and lowing herds the valley fill,                  370"
4713,THE POEM,"And louder torrents stun the noon-tide hill,"
4714,THE POEM,"[94] The pastoral Swiss begin the cliffs to scale,"
4715,THE POEM,Leaving to silence the deserted vale; [95]
4716,THE POEM,And like the Patriarchs in their simple age
4717,THE POEM,"Move, as the verdure leads, from stage to stage; [96]          375"
4718,THE POEM,"High and more high in summer's heat they go, [97]"
4719,THE POEM,And hear the rattling thunder far below;
4720,THE POEM,"Or steal beneath the mountains, half-deterred,"
4721,THE POEM,Where huge rocks tremble to the bellowing herd. [98]
4722,THE POEM,
4723,THE POEM,"One I behold who, 'cross the foaming flood,                  380"
4724,THE POEM,Leaps with a bound of graceful hardihood;
4725,THE POEM,Another high on that green ledge;--he gained
4726,THE POEM,The tempting spot with every sinew strained; [99]
4727,THE POEM,"And downward thence a knot of grass he throws,"
4728,THE POEM,Food for his beasts in time of winter snows. [100]             385
4729,THE POEM,--Far different life from what Tradition hoar
4730,THE POEM,Transmits of happier lot in times of yore! [101]
4731,THE POEM,Then Summer lingered long; and honey flowed
4732,THE POEM,"From out the rocks, the wild bees' safe abode: [102]"
4733,THE POEM,"Continual waters [103] welling cheered the waste,              390"
4734,THE POEM,"And plants were wholesome, now of deadly taste:"
4735,THE POEM,"Nor Winter yet his frozen stores had piled,"
4736,THE POEM,Usurping where the fairest herbage smiled:
4737,THE POEM,"Nor Hunger driven the herds from pastures bare,"
4738,THE POEM,To climb the treacherous cliffs for scanty fare. [104]         395
4739,THE POEM,"Then the milk-thistle flourished through the land,"
4740,THE POEM,"And forced the full-swoln udder to demand,"
4741,THE POEM,"Thrice every day, the pail and welcome hand. [105]"
4742,THE POEM,Thus does the father to his children tell
4743,THE POEM,"Of banished bliss, by fancy loved too well. [106]              400"
4744,THE POEM,Alas! that human guilt provoked the rod [107]
4745,THE POEM,Of angry Nature to avenge her God.
4746,THE POEM,"Still, Nature, ever just, to him imparts"
4747,THE POEM,Joys only given to uncorrupted hearts.
4748,THE POEM,
4749,THE POEM,'Tis morn: with gold the verdant mountain glows;             405
4750,THE POEM,"More high, the snowy peaks with hues of rose."
4751,THE POEM,"Far-stretched beneath the many-tinted hills,"
4752,THE POEM,"A mighty waste of mist the valley fills,"
4753,THE POEM,A solemn sea! whose billows wide around [108]
4754,THE POEM,"Stand motionless, to awful silence bound:                      410"
4755,THE POEM,"Pines, on the coast, through mist their tops uprear,"
4756,THE POEM,That like to leaning masts of stranded ships appear.
4757,THE POEM,"A single chasm, a gulf of gloomy blue,"
4758,THE POEM,Gapes in the centre of the sea--and through
4759,THE POEM,"That dark mysterious gulf ascending, sound                     415"
4760,THE POEM,Innumerable streams with roar profound. [109]
4761,THE POEM,"Mount through the nearer vapours notes of birds,"
4762,THE POEM,"And merry flageolet; the low of herds,"
4763,THE POEM,"The bark of dogs, the heifer's tinkling bell,"
4764,THE POEM,"Talk, laughter, and perchance a church-tower knell: [110]      420"
4765,THE POEM,"Think not, the peasant from aloft has gazed"
4766,THE POEM,"And heard with heart unmoved, with soul unraised: [111]"
4767,THE POEM,"Nor is his spirit less enrapt, nor less"
4768,THE POEM,"Alive to independent happiness, [112]"
4769,THE POEM,"Then, when he lies, out-stretched, at even-tide                425"
4770,THE POEM,Upon the fragrant mountain's purple side: [113]
4771,THE POEM,For as the pleasures of his simple day
4772,THE POEM,"Beyond his native valley seldom stray,"
4773,THE POEM,Nought round its darling precincts can he find
4774,THE POEM,But brings some past enjoyment to his mind;                    430
4775,THE POEM,"While Hope, reclining upon Pleasure's urn, [114]"
4776,THE POEM,"Binds her wild wreaths, and whispers his return."
4777,THE POEM,
4778,THE POEM,"Once, Man entirely free, alone and wild,"
4779,THE POEM,Was blest as free--for he was Nature's child.
4780,THE POEM,"He, all superior but his God disdained,                        435"
4781,THE POEM,"Walked none restraining, and by none restrained:"
4782,THE POEM,"Confessed no law but what his reason taught,"
4783,THE POEM,"Did all he wished, and wished but what he ought."
4784,THE POEM,As man in his primeval dower arrayed
4785,THE POEM,"The image of his glorious Sire displayed,                      440"
4786,THE POEM,"Even so, by faithful [115] Nature guarded, here"
4787,THE POEM,The traces of primeval Man appear;
4788,THE POEM,The simple [116] dignity no forms debase;
4789,THE POEM,"The eye sublime, and surly lion-grace:"
4790,THE POEM,"The slave of none, of beasts alone the lord,                   445"
4791,THE POEM,"His book he prizes, nor neglects his sword; [117]"
4792,THE POEM,"--Well taught by that to feel his rights, prepared"
4793,THE POEM,"With this ""the blessings he enjoys to guard."" [X]"
4794,THE POEM,
4795,THE POEM,"And, as his native hills encircle ground"
4796,THE POEM,"For many a marvellous [118] victory renowned,                  450"
4797,THE POEM,"The work of Freedom daring to oppose,"
4798,THE POEM,"With few in arms, [Y] innumerable foes,"
4799,THE POEM,"When to those famous [119] fields his steps are led,"
4800,THE POEM,An unknown power connects him with the dead:
4801,THE POEM,For images of other worlds are there;                          455
4802,THE POEM,"Awful the light, and holy is the air."
4803,THE POEM,"Fitfully, and in flashes, through his soul,"
4804,THE POEM,"Like sun-lit tempests, troubled transports roll;"
4805,THE POEM,"His bosom heaves, his Spirit towers amain, [120]"
4806,THE POEM,Beyond the senses and their little reign.                      460
4807,THE POEM,
4808,THE POEM,"And oft, when that dread vision hath past by, [121]"
4809,THE POEM,"He holds with God himself communion high,"
4810,THE POEM,There where the peal [122] of swelling torrents fills
4811,THE POEM,The sky-roofed temple of the eternal hills;
4812,THE POEM,"Or, when upon the mountain's silent brow                       465"
4813,THE POEM,"Reclined, he sees, above him and below,"
4814,THE POEM,Bright stars of ice and azure fields of snow;
4815,THE POEM,While needle peaks of granite shooting bare
4816,THE POEM,Tremble in ever-varying tints of air.
4817,THE POEM,And when a gathering weight of shadows brown                   470
4818,THE POEM,Falls on the valleys as the sun goes down;
4819,THE POEM,"And Pikes, of darkness named and fear and storms, [Z]"
4820,THE POEM,"Uplift in quiet their illumined forms, [123]"
4821,THE POEM,"In sea-like reach of prospect round him spread,"
4822,THE POEM,Tinged like an angel's smile all rosy red--                   475
4823,THE POEM,"Awe in his breast with holiest love unites,"
4824,THE POEM,And the near heavens impart their own delights. [124]
4825,THE POEM,
4826,THE POEM,"When downward to his winter hut he goes,"
4827,THE POEM,Dear and more dear the lessening circle grows;
4828,THE POEM,That hut which on the hills so oft employs                     480
4829,THE POEM,"His thoughts, the central point of all his joys. [125]"
4830,THE POEM,"And as a swallow, at the hour of rest,"
4831,THE POEM,"Peeps often ere she darts into her nest,"
4832,THE POEM,"So to the homestead, where the grandsire tends"
4833,THE POEM,"A little prattling child, he oft descends,                     485"
4834,THE POEM,To glance a look upon the well-matched pair; [126]
4835,THE POEM,Till storm and driving ice blockade him there.
4836,THE POEM,"There, [127] safely guarded by the woods behind,"
4837,THE POEM,"He hears the chiding of the baffled wind,"
4838,THE POEM,"Hears Winter calling all his terrors round,                    490"
4839,THE POEM,"And, blest within himself, he shrinks not from the sound. [128]"
4840,THE POEM,
4841,THE POEM,"Through Nature's vale his homely pleasures glide,"
4842,THE POEM,"Unstained by envy, discontent, and pride;"
4843,THE POEM,"The bound of all his vanity, to deck,"
4844,THE POEM,"With one bright bell, a favourite heifer's neck;               495"
4845,THE POEM,"Well pleased [129] upon some simple annual feast,"
4846,THE POEM,"Remembered half the year and hoped the rest,"
4847,THE POEM,"If dairy-produce, from his inner hoard,"
4848,THE POEM,Of thrice ten summers dignify [130] the board.
4849,THE POEM,--Alas! in every clime a flying ray                            500
4850,THE POEM,Is all we have to cheer our wintry way;
4851,THE POEM,[131]
4852,THE POEM,And here the unwilling mind [132] may more than trace
4853,THE POEM,The general sorrows of the human race:
4854,THE POEM,"The churlish gales of penury, that blow"
4855,THE POEM,"Cold as the north-wind o'er a waste of snow, [133]             505"
4856,THE POEM,To them [134] the gentle groups of bliss deny
4857,THE POEM,That on the noon-day bank of leisure lie.
4858,THE POEM,Yet more;--compelled by Powers which only deign
4859,THE POEM,"That _solitary_ man disturb their reign,"
4860,THE POEM,Powers that support an unremitting [135] strife                510
4861,THE POEM,"With all the tender charities of life,"
4862,THE POEM,"Full oft the father, when his sons have grown"
4863,THE POEM,"To manhood, seems their title to disown; [136]"
4864,THE POEM,And from his nest [137] amid the storms of heaven
4865,THE POEM,"Drives, eagle-like, those sons as he was driven;               515"
4866,THE POEM,With stern composure [138] watches to the plain--
4867,THE POEM,"And never, eagle-like, beholds again!"
4868,THE POEM,
4869,THE POEM,"When long familiar joys are all resigned,"
4870,THE POEM,Why does their sad remembrance haunt the mind? [139]
4871,THE POEM,"Lo! where through flat Batavia's willowy groves,               520"
4872,THE POEM,"Or by the lazy Seine, the exile roves;"
4873,THE POEM,"O'er the curled waters Alpine measures swell,"
4874,THE POEM,And search the affections to their inmost cell;
4875,THE POEM,"Sweet poison spreads along the listener's veins,"
4876,THE POEM,Turning past pleasures into mortal pains; [140]                525
4877,THE POEM,"Poison, which not a frame of steel can brave,"
4878,THE POEM,Bows his young head with sorrow to the grave. [Aa]
4879,THE POEM,
4880,THE POEM,"Gay lark of hope, thy silent song resume!"
4881,THE POEM,"Ye flattering eastern lights, once more the hills illume! [141]"
4882,THE POEM,"Fresh [142] gales and dews of life's delicious morn,           530"
4883,THE POEM,"And thou, lost fragrance of the heart, return!"
4884,THE POEM,"Alas! the little joy to man allowed,"
4885,THE POEM,Fades like the lustre of an evening cloud; [143]
4886,THE POEM,"Or like the beauty in a flower installed,"
4887,THE POEM,"Whose season was, and cannot be recalled.                      535"
4888,THE POEM,"Yet, when opprest by sickness, grief, or care,"
4889,THE POEM,"And taught that pain is pleasure's natural heir,"
4890,THE POEM,We still confide in more than we can know;
4891,THE POEM,Death would be else the favourite friend of woe. [144]
4892,THE POEM,
4893,THE POEM,"'Mid savage rocks, and seas of snow that shine,              540"
4894,THE POEM,"Between interminable tracts of pine,"
4895,THE POEM,"Within a temple stands an awful shrine, [145]"
4896,THE POEM,"By an uncertain light revealed, that falls"
4897,THE POEM,On the mute Image and the troubled walls.
4898,THE POEM,Oh! give not me that eye of hard disdain                       545
4899,THE POEM,"That views, undimmed, Ensiedlen's [Bb] wretched fane."
4900,THE POEM,"While ghastly faces through the gloom appear, [146]"
4901,THE POEM,"Abortive joy, and hope that works in fear; [147]"
4902,THE POEM,"While prayer contends with silenced agony, [148]"
4903,THE POEM,Surely in other thoughts contempt may die.                     550
4904,THE POEM,If the sad grave of human ignorance bear
4905,THE POEM,"One flower of hope--oh, pass and leave it there! [Cc]"
4906,THE POEM,
4907,THE POEM,"The tall sun, pausing [149] on an Alpine spire,"
4908,THE POEM,Flings o'er the wilderness a stream of fire:
4909,THE POEM,Now meet we other pilgrims ere the day [150]                   555
4910,THE POEM,Close on the remnant of their weary way;
4911,THE POEM,While they are drawing toward the sacred floor
4912,THE POEM,"Where, so they fondly think, the worm shall gnaw no more. [151]"
4913,THE POEM,How gaily murmur and how sweetly taste
4914,THE POEM,The fountains [Dd] reared for them [152] amid the waste!       560
4915,THE POEM,"Their thirst they slake:--they wash their toil-worn feet,"
4916,THE POEM,And some with tears of joy each other greet. [153]
4917,THE POEM,"Yes, I must [154] see you when ye first behold"
4918,THE POEM,"Those holy turrets tipped with evening gold,"
4919,THE POEM,In that glad moment will for you a sigh                        565
4920,THE POEM,"Be heaved, of charitable sympathy; [155]"
4921,THE POEM,In that glad moment when your [156] hands are prest
4922,THE POEM,In mute devotion on the thankful breast!
4923,THE POEM,
4924,THE POEM,"Last, let us turn to Chamouny that shields [157]"
4925,THE POEM,With rocks and gloomy woods [158] her fertile fields:          570
4926,THE POEM,"Five streams of ice amid her cots descend,"
4927,THE POEM,And with wild flowers and blooming orchards blend;--[Ee]
4928,THE POEM,A scene more fair than what the Grecian feigns
4929,THE POEM,Of purple lights and ever-vernal plains;
4930,THE POEM,Here all the seasons revel hand in hand:                       575
4931,THE POEM,'Mid lawns and shades by breezy rivulets fanned [159]
4932,THE POEM,[160] They sport beneath that mountain's matchless height [161]
4933,THE POEM,That holds no commerce with the summer night. [Ee]
4934,THE POEM,"From age to age, throughout [162] his lonely bounds"
4935,THE POEM,The crash of ruin fitfully resounds;                           580
4936,THE POEM,"Appalling [163] havoc! but serene his brow,"
4937,THE POEM,Where daylight lingers on [164] perpetual snow;
4938,THE POEM,"Glitter the stars, and all is black below. [Ee]"
4939,THE POEM,
4940,THE POEM,"What marvel then if many a Wanderer sigh,"
4941,THE POEM,"While roars the sullen Arve in anger by, [165]                 585"
4942,THE POEM,"That not for thy reward, unrivall'd [166] Vale! [Ff]"
4943,THE POEM,Waves the ripe harvest in the autumnal gale;
4944,THE POEM,"That thou, the slave of slaves, art doomed to pine"
4945,THE POEM,"And droop, while no Italian arts are thine,"
4946,THE POEM,"To soothe or cheer, to soften or refine. [167]                 590"
4947,THE POEM,
4948,THE POEM,"Hail Freedom! whether it was mine to stray,"
4949,THE POEM,"With shrill winds whistling round my lonely way, [168]"
4950,THE POEM,"On [169] the bleak sides of Cumbria's heath-clad moors,"
4951,THE POEM,Or where dank sea-weed lashes Scotland's shores;
4952,THE POEM,"To scent the sweets of Piedmont's breathing rose,              595"
4953,THE POEM,And orange gale that o'er Lugano blows;
4954,THE POEM,"Still have I found, where Tyranny prevails,"
4955,THE POEM,"That virtue languishes and pleasure fails, [170]"
4956,THE POEM,While the remotest hamlets blessings share
4957,THE POEM,"In thy loved [171] presence known, and only there;             600"
4958,THE POEM,_Heart_-blessings--outward treasures too which the eye
4959,THE POEM,"Of the sun peeping through the clouds can spy,"
4960,THE POEM,And every passing breeze will testify. [172]
4961,THE POEM,"There, to the porch, belike with jasmine bound"
4962,THE POEM,"Or woodbine wreaths, a smoother path is wound; [173]           605"
4963,THE POEM,"The housewife there a brighter garden sees,"
4964,THE POEM,Where hum on busier wing her happy bees; [174]
4965,THE POEM,On infant cheeks there fresher roses blow;
4966,THE POEM,"And grey-haired men look up with livelier brow,--[175]"
4967,THE POEM,To greet the traveller needing food and rest;                  610
4968,THE POEM,"Housed for the night, or but a half-hour's guest. [176]"
4969,THE POEM,
4970,THE POEM,"And oh, fair France! though now the traveller sees"
4971,THE POEM,Thy three-striped banner fluctuate on the breeze;[177]
4972,THE POEM,"Though martial songs have banished songs of love,"
4973,THE POEM,"And nightingales desert the village grove, [178]               615"
4974,THE POEM,"Scared by the fife and rumbling drum's alarms,"
4975,THE POEM,"And the short thunder, and the flash of arms;"
4976,THE POEM,"That cease not till night falls, when far and nigh,"
4977,THE POEM,"Sole sound, the Sourd [Gg] prolongs his mournful cry! [179]"
4978,THE POEM,"--Yet, hast thou found that Freedom spreads her power          620"
4979,THE POEM,"Beyond the cottage-hearth, the cottage-door:"
4980,THE POEM,"All nature smiles, and owns beneath her eyes"
4981,THE POEM,"Her fields peculiar, and peculiar skies."
4982,THE POEM,"Yes, as I roamed where Loiret's waters glide"
4983,THE POEM,"Through rustling aspens heard from side to side,               625"
4984,THE POEM,When from October clouds a milder light
4985,THE POEM,Fell where the blue flood rippled into white;
4986,THE POEM,Methought from every cot the watchful bird
4987,THE POEM,Crowed with ear-piercing power till then unheard;
4988,THE POEM,"Each clacking mill, that broke the murmuring streams,          630"
4989,THE POEM,Rocked the charmed thought in more delightful dreams;
4990,THE POEM,"Chasing those pleasant dreams, [180] the falling leaf"
4991,THE POEM,Awoke a fainter sense [181] of moral grief;
4992,THE POEM,The measured echo of the distant flail
4993,THE POEM,Wound in more welcome cadence down the vale;                   635
4994,THE POEM,"With more majestic course the water rolled,"
4995,THE POEM,And ripening foliage shone with richer gold. [182]
4996,THE POEM,--But foes are gathering--Liberty must raise
4997,THE POEM,Red on the hills her beacon's far-seen blaze;
4998,THE POEM,Must bid the tocsin ring from tower to tower!--               640
4999,THE POEM,Nearer and nearer comes the trying hour! [183]
5000,THE POEM,"Rejoice, brave Land, though pride's perverted ire"
5001,THE POEM,"Rouse hell's own aid, and wrap thy fields in fire:"
5002,THE POEM,"Lo, from the flames a great and glorious birth;"
5003,THE POEM,As if a new-made heaven were hailing a new earth! [184]        645
5004,THE POEM,--All cannot be: the promise is too fair
5005,THE POEM,For creatures doomed to breathe terrestrial air:
5006,THE POEM,Yet not for this will sober reason frown
5007,THE POEM,"Upon that promise, not the hope disown;"
5008,THE POEM,She knows that only from high aims ensue                       650
5009,THE POEM,"Rich guerdons, and to them alone are due. [185]"
5010,THE POEM,
5011,THE POEM,Great God! by whom the strifes of men are weighed

7159,IN 1842.,"to time been altered in the expression, was published so far back as"
7160,IN 1842.,"the year 1798, under the title of 'The Female Vagrant'. The extract is"
7161,IN 1842.,of such length that an apology seems to be required for reprinting it
7162,IN 1842.,"here; but it was necessary to restore it to its original position, or"
7163,IN 1842.,the rest would have been unintelligible. The whole was written before
7164,IN 1842.,"the close of the year 1794, and I will detail, rather as matter of"
7165,IN 1842.,"literary biography than for any other reason, the circumstances under"
7166,IN 1842.,which it was produced.
7167,IN 1842.,
7168,IN 1842.,"During the latter part of the summer of 1793, having passed a month in"
7169,IN 1842.,"the Isle of Wight, in view of the fleet which was then preparing for"
7170,IN 1842.,"sea off Portsmouth at the commencement of the war, I left the place"
7171,IN 1842.,with melancholy forebodings. The American war was still fresh in
7172,IN 1842.,"memory. The struggle which was beginning, and which many thought would"
7173,IN 1842.,be brought to a speedy close by the irresistible arms of Great Britain
7174,IN 1842.,"being added to those of the allies, I was assured in my own mind would"
7175,IN 1842.,"be of long continuance, and productive of distress and misery beyond"
7176,IN 1842.,all possible calculation. This conviction was pressed upon me by
7177,IN 1842.,"having been a witness, during a long residence in revolutionary"
7178,IN 1842.,"France, of the spirit which prevailed in that country. After leaving"
7179,IN 1842.,"the Isle of Wight, I spent two [A] days in wandering on foot over"
7180,IN 1842.,"Salisbury Plain, which, though cultivation was then widely spread"
7181,IN 1842.,"through parts of it, had upon the whole a still more impressive"
7182,IN 1842.,appearance than it now retains.
7183,IN 1842.,
7184,IN 1842.,"The monuments and traces of antiquity, scattered in abundance over"
7185,IN 1842.,"that region, led me unavoidably to compare what we know or guess of"
7186,IN 1842.,"those remote times with certain aspects of modern society, and with"
7187,IN 1842.,"calamities, principally those consequent upon war, to which, more than"
7188,IN 1842.,"other classes of men, the poor are subject. In those reflections,"
7189,IN 1842.,"joined with some particular facts that had come to my knowledge, the"
7190,IN 1842.,following stanzas originated.

7193,IN 1842.,"are well acquainted with Salisbury Plain, it may be proper to say,"

7201,IN 1842.,"to the dates 1793 and '94; but, in fact, much of the Female Vagrant's"
7202,IN 1842.,story was composed at least two years before. All that relates to her
7203,IN 1842.,"sufferings as a sailor's wife in America, and her condition of mind"
7204,IN 1842.,"during her voyage home, were faithfully taken from the report made to"
7205,IN 1842.,me of her own case by a friend who had been subjected to the same
7206,IN 1842.,"trials, and affected in the same way. Mr. Coleridge, when I first"
7207,IN 1842.,"became acquainted with him, was so much impressed with this poem, that"
7208,IN 1842.,it would have encouraged me to publish the whole as it then stood; but
7209,IN 1842.,"the mariner's fate appeared to me so tragical, as to require a"
7210,IN 1842.,"treatment more subdued, and yet more strictly applicable in"
7211,IN 1842.,"expression, than I had at first given to it. This fault was corrected"
7212,IN 1842.,"nearly sixty years afterwards, when I determined to publish the whole."
7213,IN 1842.,"It may be worth while to remark, that, though the incidents of this"
7214,IN 1842.,"attempt do only in a small degree produce each other, and it deviates"
7215,IN 1842.,accordingly from the general rule by which narrative pieces ought to
7216,IN 1842.,"be governed, it is not, therefore, wanting in continuous hold upon the"
7217,IN 1842.,"mind, or in unity, which is effected by the identity of moral interest"
7218,IN 1842.,that places the two personages upon the same footing in the reader's
7219,IN 1842.,"sympathies. My ramble over many parts of Salisbury Plain put me, as"
7220,IN 1842.,"mentioned in the preface, upon writing this poem, and left upon my"
7221,IN 1842.,"mind imaginative impressions, the force of which I have felt to this"
7222,IN 1842.,"day. From that district I proceeded to Bath, Bristol, and so on to the"
7223,IN 1842.,banks of the Wye; where I took again to travelling on foot. In

8948,PROSPECT,"lake, and lay open to it, has long been enclosed; so that the road has"
8949,PROSPECT,lost much of its attraction. This spot was my favourite walk in the
8950,PROSPECT,evenings during the latter part of my school-time. The individual
8951,PROSPECT,"whose habits and character are here given, was a gentleman of the"

8953,PROSPECT,"one of our Universities, and returned to pass his time in seclusion on"
8954,PROSPECT,his own estate. He died a bachelor in middle age. Induced by the
8955,PROSPECT,"beauty of the prospect, he built a small summer-house, on the rocks"

8957,PROSPECT,afterwards passed into the hands of the late Mr. Curwen. The site was

8962,PROSPECT,"Hawkshead a youngster about my own age, an Irish boy, who was a"
8963,PROSPECT,servant to an itinerant conjurer. My notion was to witness the

9056,THE POEM,"of the lake, a little to the left above the present highway, as one goes"
9057,THE POEM,"towards Sawrey. Mr. Bowman, the son of Wordsworth's last teacher at the"

9059,THE POEM,"nearer the village than the yew which is now on the roadside, and is"
9060,THE POEM,"sometimes called ""Wordsworth's Yew."" In the poet's school-days the road"
9061,THE POEM,"passed right through the unenclosed common, and the tree was a"
9062,THE POEM,"conspicuous object. It was removed, he says, owing to the popular belief"
9063,THE POEM,"that its leaves were poisonous, and might injure the cattle grazing in"
9064,THE POEM,"the common. The present tree is erroneously called ""Wordsworth's Yew."""

9215,A TRAGEDY,
9216,A TRAGEDY,"This Dramatic Piece, as noted in its title-page, was composed in"
9217,A TRAGEDY,1795-6. It lay nearly from that time till within the last two or three
9218,A TRAGEDY,"months unregarded among my papers, without being mentioned even to my"
9219,A TRAGEDY,"most intimate friends. Having, however, impressions upon my mind which"
9220,A TRAGEDY,"made me unwilling to destroy the MS., I determined to undertake the"
9221,A TRAGEDY,"responsibility of publishing it during my own life, rather than impose"
9222,A TRAGEDY,upon my successors the task of deciding its fate. Accordingly it has
9223,A TRAGEDY,"been revised with some care; but, as it was at first written, and is"
9224,A TRAGEDY,"now published, without any view to its exhibition upon the stage, not"
9225,A TRAGEDY,"the slightest alteration has been made in the conduct of the story, or"
9226,A TRAGEDY,"the composition of the characters; above all, in respect to the two"
9227,A TRAGEDY,"leading Persons of the Drama, I felt no inducement to make any change."
9228,A TRAGEDY,"The study of human nature suggests this awful truth, that, as in the"
9229,A TRAGEDY,"trials to which life subjects us, sin and crime are apt to start from"
9230,A TRAGEDY,"their very opposite qualities, so there are no limits to the hardening"
9231,A TRAGEDY,"of the heart, and the perversion of the understanding to which they"
9232,A TRAGEDY,"may carry their slaves. During my long residence in France, while the"
9233,A TRAGEDY,"Revolution was rapidly advancing to its extreme of wickedness, I had"
9234,A TRAGEDY,"frequent opportunities of being an eye-witness of this process, and it"
9235,A TRAGEDY,"was while that knowledge was fresh upon my memory, that the Tragedy of"
9236,A TRAGEDY,'The Borderers' was composed. [C]

9241,A TRAGEDY,
9242,A TRAGEDY,[Of this dramatic work I have little to say in addition to the short
9243,A TRAGEDY,printed note which will be found attached to it. It was composed at
9244,A TRAGEDY,"Racedown, in Dorset, during the latter part of the year 1795, and in"
9245,A TRAGEDY,"the following year. Had it been the work of a later period of life, it"
9246,A TRAGEDY,would have been different in some respects from what it is now. The
9247,A TRAGEDY,"plot would have been something more complex, and a greater variety of"
9248,A TRAGEDY,characters introduced to relieve the mind from the pressure of
9249,A TRAGEDY,incidents so mournful. The manners also would have been more attended
9250,A TRAGEDY,to. My care was almost exclusively given to the passions and the
9251,A TRAGEDY,"characters, and the position in which the persons in the drama stood"
9252,A TRAGEDY,"relatively to each other, that the reader (for I had then no thought"
9253,A TRAGEDY,"of the stage) might be moved, and to a degree instructed, by lights"
9254,A TRAGEDY,"penetrating somewhat into the depths of our nature. In this endeavour,"
9255,A TRAGEDY,"I cannot think, upon a very late review, that I have failed. As to the"
9256,A TRAGEDY,"scene and period of action, little more was required for my purpose"
9257,A TRAGEDY,"than the absence of established law and government, so that the agents"
9258,A TRAGEDY,"might be at liberty to act on their own impulses. Nevertheless, I do"
9259,A TRAGEDY,"remember, that having a wish to colour the manners in some degree from"
9260,A TRAGEDY,"local history more than my knowledge enabled me to do, I read"
9261,A TRAGEDY,"Redpath's 'History of the Borders', but found there nothing to my"
9262,A TRAGEDY,"purpose. I once made an observation to Sir W. Scott, in which he"
9263,A TRAGEDY,"concurred, that it was difficult to conceive how so dull a book could"
9264,A TRAGEDY,"be written on such a subject. Much about the same time, but little"
9265,A TRAGEDY,"after, Coleridge was employed in writing his tragedy of 'Remorse'; and"
9266,A TRAGEDY,"it happened that soon after, through one of the Mr. Poole's, Mr."
9267,A TRAGEDY,"Knight, the actor, heard that we had been engaged in writing plays,"
9268,A TRAGEDY,"and upon his suggestion, mine was curtailed, and I believe Coleridge's"
9269,A TRAGEDY,"also, was offered to Mr. Harris, manager of Covent Garden. For myself,"
9270,A TRAGEDY,"I had no hope, nor even a wish (though a successful play would in the"
9271,A TRAGEDY,then state of my finances have been a most welcome piece of good
9272,A TRAGEDY,"fortune), that he should accept my performance; so that I incurred no"
9273,A TRAGEDY,disappointment when the piece was _judiciously_ returned as not
9274,A TRAGEDY,calculated for the stage. In this judgment I entirely concurred: and
9275,A TRAGEDY,"had it been otherwise, it was so natural for me to shrink from public"
9276,A TRAGEDY,"notice, that any hope I might have had of success would not have"
9277,A TRAGEDY,"reconciled me altogether to such an exhibition. Mr. C.'s play was, as"
9278,A TRAGEDY,"is well known, brought forward several years after, through the"
9279,A TRAGEDY,"kindness of Mr. Sheridan. In conclusion, I may observe, that while I"
9280,A TRAGEDY,"was composing this play, I wrote a short essay, illustrative of that"
9281,A TRAGEDY,constitution and those tendencies of human nature which make the
9282,A TRAGEDY,apparently 'motiveless' actions of bad men intelligible to careful
9283,A TRAGEDY,observers. This was partly done with reference to the character of
9284,A TRAGEDY,"Oswald, and his persevering endeavour to lead the man he disliked into"
9285,A TRAGEDY,so heinous a crime; but still more to preserve in my distinct
9286,A TRAGEDY,"remembrance, what I had observed of transitions in character, and the"
9287,A TRAGEDY,"reflections I had been led to make, during the time I was a witness of"
9288,A TRAGEDY,the changes through which the French Revolution passed.--I. F.]

9547,ACT I,"IDONEA        Dear Father, you sigh deeply; ever since"
9548,ACT I,"We left the willow shade by the brook-side,"
9549,ACT I,Your natural breathing has been troubled.
9550,ACT I,
9551,ACT I,
9552,ACT I,"HERBERT       Nay,"
9553,ACT I,"You are too fearful; yet must I confess,"
9554,ACT I,Our march of yesterday had better suited
9555,ACT I,A firmer step than mine.

9557,ACT I,
9558,ACT I,IDONEA                                That dismal Moor--
9559,ACT I,"In spite of all the larks that cheered our path,"
9560,ACT I,I never can forgive it: but how steadily
9561,ACT I,"_You_ paced along, when the bewildering moonlight"
9562,ACT I,Mocked me with many a strange fantastic shape!--
9563,ACT I,I thought the Convent never would appear;
9564,ACT I,"It seemed to move away from us: and yet,"
9565,ACT I,That you are thus the fault is mine; for the air
9566,ACT I,"Was soft and warm, no dew lay on the grass,"
9567,ACT I,And midway on the waste ere night had fallen
9568,ACT I,I spied a Covert walled and roofed with sods--
9569,ACT I,"A miniature; belike some Shepherd-boy,"
9570,ACT I,Who might have found a nothing-doing hour
9571,ACT I,"Heavier than work, raised it: within that hut"
9572,ACT I,"We might have made a kindly bed of heath,"
9573,ACT I,And thankfully there rested side by side
9574,ACT I,"Wrapped in our cloaks, and, with recruited strength,"
9575,ACT I,"Have hailed the morning sun. But cheerily, Father,--"
9576,ACT I,"That staff of yours, I could almost have heart"
9577,ACT I,To fling't away from you: you make no use
9578,ACT I,"Of me, or of my strength;--come, let me feel"
9579,ACT I,That you do press upon me. There--indeed
9580,ACT I,You are quite exhausted. Let us rest awhile
9581,ACT I,On this green bank.

9592,ACT I,IDONEA                              Do not reproach me:
9593,ACT I,I pondered patiently your wish and will
9594,ACT I,"When I gave way to your request; and now,"
9595,ACT I,"When I behold the ruins of that face,"
9596,ACT I,"Those eyeballs dark--dark beyond hope of light,"
9597,ACT I,"And think that they were blasted for my sake,"
9598,ACT I,The name of Marmaduke is blown away:

9615,ACT I,
9616,ACT I,

9618,ACT I,As if we two were twins; two songsters bred
9619,ACT I,"In the same nest, my spring-time one with thine."
9620,ACT I,"My fancies, fancies if they be, are such"
9621,ACT I,"As come, dear Child! from a far deeper source"
9622,ACT I,Than bodily weariness. While here we sit
9623,ACT I,I feel my strength returning.--The bequest
9624,ACT I,"Of thy kind Patroness, which to receive"
9625,ACT I,"We have thus far adventured, will suffice"
9626,ACT I,To save thee from the extreme of penury;
9627,ACT I,"But when thy Father must lie down and die,"
9628,ACT I,How wilt thou stand alone?

9637,ACT I,"Out of thy mind? My dear, my only, Child;"

9642,ACT I,IDONEA                         O could you hear his voice:
9643,ACT I,Alas! you do not know him. He is one
9644,ACT I,(I wot not what ill tongue has wronged him with you)
9645,ACT I,All gentleness and love. His face bespeaks
9646,ACT I,"A deep and simple meekness: and that Soul,"
9647,ACT I,Which with the motion of a virtuous act
9648,ACT I,"Flashes a look of terror upon guilt,"
9649,ACT I,"Is, after conflict, quiet as the ocean,"

9657,ACT I,Thus much to speak; but think not I forget--
9658,ACT I,Dear Father! how _could_ I forget and live--
9659,ACT I,You and the story of that doleful night
9660,ACT I,"When, Antioch blazing to her topmost towers,"
9661,ACT I,"You rushed into the murderous flames, returned"
9662,ACT I,"Blind as the grave, but, as you oft have told me,"
9663,ACT I,Clasping your infant Daughter to your heart.
9664,ACT I,
9665,ACT I,
9666,ACT I,"HERBERT       Thy Mother too!--scarce had I gained the door,"
9667,ACT I,"I caught her voice; she threw herself upon me,"
9668,ACT I,I felt thy infant brother in her arms;
9669,ACT I,She saw my blasted face--a tide of soldiers
9670,ACT I,"That instant rushed between us, and I heard"
9671,ACT I,"Her last death-shriek, distinct among a thousand."
9672,ACT I,
9673,ACT I,

9678,ACT I,"For my old age, it doth remain with thee"
9679,ACT I,"To make it what thou wilt. Thou hast been told,"
9680,ACT I,"That when, on our return from Palestine,"
9681,ACT I,"I found how my domains had been usurped,"
9682,ACT I,"I took thee in my arms, and we began"
9683,ACT I,Our wanderings together. Providence
9684,ACT I,"At length conducted us to Rossland,--there,"
9685,ACT I,Our melancholy story moved a Stranger
9686,ACT I,"To take thee to her home--and for myself,"
9687,ACT I,"Soon after, the good Abbot of St. Cuthbert's"
9688,ACT I,"Supplied my helplessness with food and raiment,"
9689,ACT I,"And, as thou know'st, gave me that humble Cot"
9690,ACT I,Where now we dwell.--For many years I bore
9691,ACT I,"Thy absence, till old age and fresh infirmities"
9692,ACT I,"Exacted thy return, and our reunion."
9693,ACT I,"I did not think that, during that long absence,"
9694,ACT I,"My Child, forgetful of the name of Herbert,"
9695,ACT I,"Had given her love to a wild Freebooter,"
9696,ACT I,"Who here, upon the borders of the Tweed,"
9697,ACT I,"Doth prey alike on two distracted Countries,"

10081,MARMADUKE,Nor moves her hands to any needful work:
10082,MARMADUKE,She eats her food which every day the peasants
10083,MARMADUKE,Bring to her hut; and so the Wretch has lived
10084,MARMADUKE,Ten years; and no one ever heard her voice;
10085,MARMADUKE,But every night at the first stroke of twelve
10086,MARMADUKE,"She quits her house, and, in the neighbouring Churchyard"
10087,MARMADUKE,"Upon the self-same spot, in rain or storm,"
10088,MARMADUKE,She paces out the hour 'twixt twelve and one--
10089,MARMADUKE,"She paces round and round an Infant's grave,"
10090,MARMADUKE,And in the Churchyard sod her feet have worn
10091,MARMADUKE,A hollow ring; they say it is knee-deep--

10099,MARMADUKE,"BEGGAR        O Gentlemen, I thank you;"
10100,MARMADUKE,I've had the saddest dream that ever troubled
10101,MARMADUKE,The heart of living creature.--My poor Babe
10102,MARMADUKE,"Was crying, as I thought, crying for bread"
10103,MARMADUKE,"When I had none to give him; whereupon,"
10104,MARMADUKE,"I put a slip of foxglove in his hand,"
10105,MARMADUKE,"Which pleased him so, that he was hushed at once:"
10106,MARMADUKE,"When, into one of those same spotted bells"
10107,MARMADUKE,"A bee came darting, which the Child with joy"
10108,MARMADUKE,"Imprisoned there, and held it to his ear,"
10109,MARMADUKE,"And suddenly grew black, as he would die."
10110,MARMADUKE,
10111,MARMADUKE,
10112,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     We have no time for this, my babbling Gossip;"
10113,MARMADUKE,Here's what will comfort you.

10118,MARMADUKE,"For this good deed!--Well, Sirs, this passed away;"
10119,MARMADUKE,"And afterwards I fancied, a strange dog,"
10120,MARMADUKE,"Trotting alone along the beaten road,"
10121,MARMADUKE,Came to my child as by my side he slept
10122,MARMADUKE,"And, fondling, licked his face, then on a sudden"

10124,MARMADUKE,"But here he is,"
10125,MARMADUKE,[kissing the Child]
10126,MARMADUKE,it must have been a dream.

10135,MARMADUKE,The weary-worn.--You gentlefolk have got
10136,MARMADUKE,Warm chambers to your wish. I'd rather be
10137,MARMADUKE,"A stone than what I am.--But two nights gone,"
10138,MARMADUKE,The darkness overtook me--wind and rain
10139,MARMADUKE,Beat hard upon my head--and yet I saw
10140,MARMADUKE,"A glow-worm, through the covert of the furze,"
10141,MARMADUKE,Shine calmly as if nothing ailed the sky:
10142,MARMADUKE,At which I half accused the God in Heaven.--
10143,MARMADUKE,You must forgive me.

10145,MARMADUKE,
10146,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD                             Ay, and if you think"
10147,MARMADUKE,"The Fairies are to blame, and you should chide"
10148,MARMADUKE,Your favourite saint--no matter--this good day
10149,MARMADUKE,Has made amends.

10154,MARMADUKE,"As I have done, my eyes upon the ground,"
10155,MARMADUKE,"Expecting still, I knew not how, to find"
10156,MARMADUKE,A piece of money glittering through the dust.
10157,MARMADUKE,
10158,MARMADUKE,
10159,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     This woman is a prater. Pray, good Lady!"

10164,MARMADUKE,This Little-one--it cuts me to the heart--
10165,MARMADUKE,"Well! they might turn a beggar from their doors,"
10166,MARMADUKE,But there are Mothers who can see the Babe
10167,MARMADUKE,"Here at my breast, and ask me where I bought it:"
10168,MARMADUKE,"This they can do, and look upon my face--"
10169,MARMADUKE,"But you, Sir, should be kinder."
10170,MARMADUKE,

10172,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE                                    Come hither, Fathers,"
10173,MARMADUKE,And learn what nature is from this poor Wretch!
10174,MARMADUKE,
10175,MARMADUKE,
10176,MARMADUKE,"BEGGAR        Ay, Sir, there's nobody that feels for us."
10177,MARMADUKE,Why now--but yesterday I overtook
10178,MARMADUKE,"A blind old Greybeard and accosted him,"
10179,MARMADUKE,"I' th' name of all the Saints, and by the Mass"
10180,MARMADUKE,He should have used me better!--Charity!
10181,MARMADUKE,"If you can melt a rock, he is your man;"
10182,MARMADUKE,But I'll be even with him--here again
10183,MARMADUKE,Have I been waiting for him.
10184,MARMADUKE,
10185,MARMADUKE,
10186,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD                                      Well, but softly,"
10187,MARMADUKE,Who is it that hath wronged you?
10188,MARMADUKE,
10189,MARMADUKE,
10190,MARMADUKE,BEGGAR                                        Mark you me;
10191,MARMADUKE,"I'll point him out;--a Maiden is his guide,"
10192,MARMADUKE,"Lovely as Spring's first rose; a little dog,"
10193,MARMADUKE,"Tied by a woollen cord, moves on before"
10194,MARMADUKE,"With look as sad as he were dumb; the cur,"
10195,MARMADUKE,"I owe him no ill will, but in good sooth"
10196,MARMADUKE,He does his Master credit.
10197,MARMADUKE,
10198,MARMADUKE,
10199,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE                               As I live,"
10200,MARMADUKE,'Tis Herbert and no other!
10201,MARMADUKE,

10204,MARMADUKE,"Lank as a ghost and tall, his shoulders bent,"
10205,MARMADUKE,"And long beard white with age--yet evermore,"
10206,MARMADUKE,"As if he were the only Saint on earth,"
10207,MARMADUKE,He turns his face to heaven.
10208,MARMADUKE,
10209,MARMADUKE,
10210,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                                   But why so violent
10211,MARMADUKE,Against this venerable Man?
10212,MARMADUKE,
10213,MARMADUKE,
10214,MARMADUKE,BEGGAR                                   I'll tell you:
10215,MARMADUKE,He has the very hardest heart on earth;
10216,MARMADUKE,I had as lief turn to the Friar's school
10217,MARMADUKE,"And knock for entrance, in mid holiday."
10218,MARMADUKE,
10219,MARMADUKE,
10220,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     But to your story.
10221,MARMADUKE,
10222,MARMADUKE,
10223,MARMADUKE,"BEGGAR                         I was saying, Sir--"
10224,MARMADUKE,"Well!--he has often spurned me like a toad,"
10225,MARMADUKE,But yesterday was worse than all;--at last
10226,MARMADUKE,"I overtook him, Sirs, my Babe and I,"
10227,MARMADUKE,And begged a little aid for charity:
10228,MARMADUKE,But he was snappish as a cottage cur.
10229,MARMADUKE,"Well then, says I--I'll out with it; at which"
10230,MARMADUKE,"I cast a look upon the Girl, and felt"
10231,MARMADUKE,As if my heart would burst; and so I left him.
10232,MARMADUKE,
10233,MARMADUKE,
10234,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD        I think, good Woman, you are the very person"
10235,MARMADUKE,"Whom, but some few days past, I saw in Eskdale,"
10236,MARMADUKE,At Herbert's door.
10237,MARMADUKE,
10238,MARMADUKE,
10239,MARMADUKE,BEGGAR                          Ay; and if truth were known
10240,MARMADUKE,I have good business there.
10241,MARMADUKE,
10242,MARMADUKE,
10243,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD                                  I met you at the threshold,"
10244,MARMADUKE,And he seemed angry.
10245,MARMADUKE,
10246,MARMADUKE,
10247,MARMADUKE,BEGGAR                             Angry! well he might;
10248,MARMADUKE,"And long as I can stir I'll dog him.--Yesterday,"
10249,MARMADUKE,"To serve me so, and knowing that he owes"
10250,MARMADUKE,The best of all he has to me and mine.
10251,MARMADUKE,But 'tis all over now.--That good old Lady
10252,MARMADUKE,"Has left a power of riches; and I say it,"
10253,MARMADUKE,"If there's a lawyer in the land, the knave"
10254,MARMADUKE,Shall give me half.
10255,MARMADUKE,
10256,MARMADUKE,
10257,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD                          What's this?--I fear, good Woman,"
10258,MARMADUKE,You have been insolent.
10259,MARMADUKE,
10260,MARMADUKE,
10261,MARMADUKE,"BEGGAR                                And there's the Baron,"
10262,MARMADUKE,I spied him skulking in his peasant's dress.
10263,MARMADUKE,
10264,MARMADUKE,

10269,MARMADUKE,With Herbert or his Daughter?
10270,MARMADUKE,
10271,MARMADUKE,
10272,MARMADUKE,BEGGAR                                     Daughter! truly--
10273,MARMADUKE,"But how's the day?--I fear, my little Boy,"
10274,MARMADUKE,"We've overslept ourselves.--Sirs, have you seen him?"
10275,MARMADUKE,[Offers to go.]
10276,MARMADUKE,
10277,MARMADUKE,
10278,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     I must have more of this;--you shall not stir
10279,MARMADUKE,"An inch, till I am answered. Know you aught"

10287,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE                              No trifling, Woman!--"
10288,MARMADUKE,
10289,MARMADUKE,
10290,MARMADUKE,OSWALD        You are as safe as in a sanctuary;
10291,MARMADUKE,Speak.
10292,MARMADUKE,
10293,MARMADUKE,
10294,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE           Speak!

10297,MARMADUKE,BEGGAR                     He is a most hard-hearted Man.
10298,MARMADUKE,

10300,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     Your life is at my mercy.

10306,MARMADUKE,
10307,MARMADUKE,
10308,MARMADUKE,OSWALD        Speak out.

10318,MARMADUKE,"What harvest it would bring us both; and so,"
10319,MARMADUKE,I parted with the Child.

10321,MARMADUKE,
10322,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                             Parted with whom? [3]
10323,MARMADUKE,
10324,MARMADUKE,
10325,MARMADUKE,"BEGGAR        Idonea, as he calls her; but the Girl"
10326,MARMADUKE,Is mine.
10327,MARMADUKE,
10328,MARMADUKE,
10329,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE             Yours, Woman! are you Herbert's wife?"
10330,MARMADUKE,

10332,MARMADUKE,"BEGGAR        Wife, Sir! his wife--not I; my husband, Sir,"
10333,MARMADUKE,Was of Kirkoswald--many a snowy winter
10334,MARMADUKE,We've weathered out together. My poor Gilfred!
10335,MARMADUKE,He has been two years in his grave.
10336,MARMADUKE,

10338,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                                         Enough.

10345,MARMADUKE,"Good Dame, repair to Liddesdale and wait"
10346,MARMADUKE,For my return; be sure you shall have justice.
10347,MARMADUKE,

10358,MARMADUKE,Here's for your little boy--and when you christen him
10359,MARMADUKE,I'll be his Godfather.

10361,MARMADUKE,"BEGGAR                               O Sir, you are merry with me."

10381,MARMADUKE,"[Calling to the Beggar, who returns; he looks at  her stedfastly.]"
10382,MARMADUKE,You are Idonea's Mother?--
10383,MARMADUKE,"Nay, be not terrified--it does me good"

10408,MARMADUKE,The blind Man--at the silent Girl he looked
10409,MARMADUKE,"With such a look--it makes me tremble, Sir,"

10421,MARMADUKE,"Oswald, the firm foundation of my life"

10436,ACT II,"He, in the preference, modest Youth, might take,"
10437,ACT II,I neither know nor care. The insult bred
10438,ACT II,More of contempt than hatred; both are flown;
10439,ACT II,That either e'er existed is my shame:
10440,ACT II,'Twas a dull spark--a most unnatural fire
10441,ACT II,That died the moment the air breathed upon it.
10442,ACT II,--These fools of feeling are mere birds of winter
10443,ACT II,"That haunt some barren island of the north,"
10444,ACT II,"Where, if a famishing man stretch forth his hand,"
10445,ACT II,They think it is to feed them. I have left him

10447,ACT II,"For a few swelling phrases, and a flash"
10448,ACT II,"Of truth, enough to dazzle and to blind,"

10453,ACT II,
10454,ACT II,
10455,ACT II,MARMADUKE     These ten years she has moved her lips all day
10456,ACT II,And never speaks!

10458,ACT II,

10461,ACT II,
10462,ACT II,MARMADUKE                                  I have seen her.
10463,ACT II,
10464,ACT II,
10465,ACT II,"OSWALD        Oh! the poor tenant of that ragged homestead,"
10466,ACT II,"Her whom the Monster, Clifford, drove to madness."
10467,ACT II,
10468,ACT II,
10469,ACT II,"MARMADUKE     I met a peasant near the spot; he told me,"
10470,ACT II,These ten years she had sate all day alone
10471,ACT II,Within those empty walls.

10473,ACT II,
10474,ACT II,OSWALD                                   I too have seen her;
10475,ACT II,"Chancing to pass this way some six months gone,"
10476,ACT II,"At midnight, I betook me to the Churchyard:"
10477,ACT II,"The moon shone clear, the air was still, so still"
10478,ACT II,The trees were silent as the graves beneath them.
10479,ACT II,"Long did I watch, and saw her pacing round"
10480,ACT II,"Upon the self-same spot, still round and round,"
10481,ACT II,Her lips for ever moving.

10498,ACT II,From that soft class of devotees who feel
10499,ACT II,"Reverence for life so deeply, that they spare"
10500,ACT II,"The verminous brood, and cherish what they spare"
10501,ACT II,While feeding on their bodies. Would that Idonea
10502,ACT II,"Were present, to the end that we might hear"
10503,ACT II,What she can urge in his defence; she loves him.
10504,ACT II,
10505,ACT II,
10506,ACT II,"MARMADUKE     Yes, loves him; 'tis a truth that multiplies"
10507,ACT II,His guilt a thousand-fold.

10526,ACT II,"The truth shall be laid open, his guilt proved"
10527,ACT II,Before her face. The rest be left to me.
10528,ACT II,
10529,ACT II,OSWALD        You will be firm: but though we well may trust
10530,ACT II,"The issue to the justice of the cause,"
10531,ACT II,"Caution must not be flung aside; remember,"
10532,ACT II,"Yours is no common life. Self-stationed here,"
10533,ACT II,"Upon these savage confines, we have seen you"
10534,ACT II,Stand like an isthmus 'twixt two stormy seas
10535,ACT II,That oft have checked their fury at your bidding.
10536,ACT II,"'Mid the deep holds of Solway's mossy waste,"
10537,ACT II,Your single virtue has transformed a Band
10538,ACT II,Of fierce barbarians into Ministers
10539,ACT II,Of peace and order. Aged men with tears
10540,ACT II,"Have blessed their steps, the fatherless retire"
10541,ACT II,"For shelter to their banners. But it is,"
10542,ACT II,"As you must needs have deeply felt, it is"
10543,ACT II,In darkness and in tempest that we seek
10544,ACT II,The majesty of Him who rules the world.
10545,ACT II,"Benevolence, that has not heart to use"
10546,ACT II,"The wholesome ministry of pain and evil,"
10547,ACT II,Becomes at last weak and contemptible.
10548,ACT II,"Your generous qualities have won due praise,"
10549,ACT II,But vigorous Spirits look for something more
10550,ACT II,Than Youth's spontaneous products; and to-day

10553,ACT II,

10556,ACT II,"Which to our kind is natural as life,"
10557,ACT II,"Be known unto you, you will love this Woman,"
10558,ACT II,"Even as I do; but I should loathe the light,"

10567,ACT II,"'Tis at this moment.--Oswald, I have loved"
10568,ACT II,"To be the friend and father of the oppressed,"
10569,ACT II,A comforter of sorrow;--there is something
10570,ACT II,"Which looks like a transition in my soul,"
10571,ACT II,And yet it is not.--Let us lead him hither.

10573,ACT II,
10574,ACT II,OSWALD        Stoop for a moment; 'tis an act of justice;
10575,ACT II,And where's the triumph if the delegate
10576,ACT II,Must fall in the execution of his office?
10577,ACT II,The deed is done--if you will have it so--
10578,ACT II,Here where we stand--that tribe of vulgar wretches
10579,ACT II,(You saw them gathering for the festival)
10580,ACT II,Rush in--the villains seize us--
10581,ACT II,
10582,ACT II,

10587,ACT II,Men who are little given to sift and weigh--
10588,ACT II,Would wreak on us the passion of the moment.

10590,ACT II,
10591,ACT II,"MARMADUKE     The cloud will soon disperse--farewell--but stay,"
10592,ACT II,Thou wilt relate the story.

10596,ACT II,"To bear a part in this Man's punishment,"
10597,ACT II,Nor be its witness?
10598,ACT II,
10599,ACT II,
10600,ACT II,MARMADUKE     I had many hopes
10601,ACT II,"That were most dear to me, and some will bear"
10602,ACT II,To be transferred to thee.
10603,ACT II,
10604,ACT II,

10606,ACT II,

10608,ACT II,MARMADUKE     I would preserve thee. How may this be done?
10609,ACT II,
10610,ACT II,
10611,ACT II,OSWALD        By showing that you look beyond the instant.
10612,ACT II,"A few leagues hence we shall have open ground,"
10613,ACT II,And nowhere upon earth is place so fit
10614,ACT II,To look upon the deed. Before we enter
10615,ACT II,"The barren Moor, hangs from a beetling rock"
10616,ACT II,The shattered Castle in which Clifford oft
10617,ACT II,"Has held infernal orgies--with the gloom,"
10618,ACT II,"And very superstition of the place,"
10619,ACT II,Seasoning his wickedness. The Debauchee
10620,ACT II,Would there perhaps have gathered the first fruits
10621,ACT II,Of this mock Father's guilt.

10684,ACT II,
10685,ACT II,OLD PILGRIM     This news! It made my heart leap up with joy.
10686,ACT II,

10698,ACT II,"From Palestine, and brought with me a heart,"
10699,ACT II,"Though rich in heavenly, poor in earthly, comfort,"
10700,ACT II,"I met your Father, then a wandering Outcast:"
10701,ACT II,"He had a Guide, a Shepherd's boy; but grieved"
10702,ACT II,He was that One so young should pass his youth
10703,ACT II,In such sad service; and he parted with him.
10704,ACT II,"We joined our tales of wretchedness together,"
10705,ACT II,And begged our daily bread from door to door.

10716,ACT II,"That a fierce storm o'ertook us, worn with travel,"
10717,ACT II,In a deep wood remote from any town.
10718,ACT II,A cave that opened to the road presented
10719,ACT II,"A friendly shelter, and we entered in."
10720,ACT II,
10721,ACT II,
10722,ACT II,IDONEA          And I was with you?
10723,ACT II,

10726,ACT II,But you were then a tottering Little-one--
10727,ACT II,We sate us down. The sky grew dark and darker:
10728,ACT II,"I struck my flint, and built up a small fire"
10729,ACT II,"With rotten boughs and leaves, such as the winds"
10730,ACT II,Of many autumns in the cave had piled.
10731,ACT II,Meanwhile the storm fell heavy on the woods;
10732,ACT II,Our little fire sent forth a cheering warmth
10733,ACT II,"And we were comforted, and talked of comfort;"
10734,ACT II,"But 'twas an angry night, and o'er our heads"
10735,ACT II,The thunder rolled in peals that would have made
10736,ACT II,A sleeping man uneasy in his bed.
10737,ACT II,"O Lady, you have need to love your Father."
10738,ACT II,"His voice--methinks I hear it now, his voice"
10739,ACT II,"When, after a broad flash that filled the cave,"
10740,ACT II,"He said to me, that he had seen his Child,"
10741,ACT II,A face (no cherub's face more beautiful)

10776,ACT II,[Blowing his fingers.]
10777,ACT II,I long for news of our brave Comrades; Lacy

10790,ACT II,"Roared in the tempest, was within an ace"
10791,ACT II,Of sending to his grave our precious Charge:

10793,ACT II,
10794,ACT II,

10826,ACT II,
10827,ACT II,OSWALD (aside)

10829,ACT II,
10830,ACT II,
10831,ACT II,MARMADUKE (listening)
10832,ACT II,What an odd moaning that is!--
10833,ACT II,
10834,ACT II,OSWALD.                                     Mighty odd
10835,ACT II,"The wind should pipe a little, while we stand"
10836,ACT II,Cooling our heels in this way!--I'll begin
10837,ACT II,And count the stars.

10839,ACT II,
10840,ACT II,MARMADUKE (still listening)
10841,ACT II,"That dog of his, you are sure,"
10842,ACT II,Could not come after us--he _must_ have perished;
10843,ACT II,The torrent would have dashed an oak to splinters.
10844,ACT II,You said you did not like his looks--that he
10845,ACT II,"Would trouble us; if he were here again,"
10846,ACT II,I swear the sight of him would quail me more
10847,ACT II,Than twenty armies.

10868,ACT II,

10870,ACT II,To waken our stray Baron. Were there not
10871,ACT II,"A farm or dwelling-house within five leagues,"
10872,ACT II,"We should deserve to wear a cap and bells,"
10873,ACT II,"Three good round years, for playing the fool here"

10881,ACT II,"You'd better like we should descend together,"
10882,ACT II,And lie down by his side--what say you to it?
10883,ACT II,Three of us--we should keep each other warm:
10884,ACT II,I'll answer for it that our four-legged friend
10885,ACT II,Shall not disturb us; further I'll not engage;
10886,ACT II,"Come, come, for manhood's sake!"
10887,ACT II,
10888,ACT II,
10889,ACT II,"MARMADUKE                                 These drowsy shiverings,"

10891,ACT II,What do they mean? were this my single body
10892,ACT II,"Opposed to armies, not a nerve would tremble:"
10893,ACT II,Why do I tremble now?--Is not the depth
10894,ACT II,Of this Man's crimes beyond the reach of thought?
10895,ACT II,"And yet, in plumbing the abyss for judgment,"
10896,ACT II,Something I strike upon which turns my mind
10897,ACT II,"Back on herself, I think, again--my breast"
10898,ACT II,Concentres all the terrors of the Universe:
10899,ACT II,I look at him and tremble like a child.
10900,ACT II,
10901,ACT II,
10902,ACT II,OSWALD        Is it possible?
10903,ACT II,
10904,ACT II,
10905,ACT II,MARMADUKE                     One thing you noticed not:
10906,ACT II,Just as we left the glen a clap of thunder
10907,ACT II,Burst on the mountains with hell-rousing force.
10908,ACT II,"This is a time, said he, when guilt may shudder;"
10909,ACT II,But there's a Providence for them who walk
10910,ACT II,"In helplessness, when innocence is with them."
10911,ACT II,"At this audacious blasphemy, I thought"
10912,ACT II,The spirit of vengeance seemed to ride the air.
10913,ACT II,
10914,ACT II,
10915,ACT II,OSWALD        Why are you not the man you were that moment?

10925,ACT II,
10926,ACT II,
10927,ACT II,OSWALD                       This is some sudden seizure!

10929,ACT II,
10930,ACT II,"MARMADUKE     A most strange faintness,--will you hunt me out"
10931,ACT II,A draught of water?

10933,ACT II,
10934,ACT II,"OSWALD                           Nay, to see you thus"
10935,ACT II,Moves me beyond my bearing.--I will try
10936,ACT II,To gain the torrent's brink.

10939,ACT II,[Exit OSWALD.]
10940,ACT II,
10941,ACT II,
10942,ACT II,MARMADUKE (after a pause)
10943,ACT II,It seems an age

10955,ACT II,
10956,ACT II,HERBERT       I do not hear the voice of my friend Oswald.
10957,ACT II,
10958,ACT II,"MARMADUKE     A minute past, he went to fetch a draught"
10959,ACT II,"Of water from the torrent. 'Tis, you'll say,"
10960,ACT II,A cheerless beverage.

10962,ACT II,
10963,ACT II,HERBERT                              How good it was in you
10964,ACT II,"To stay behind!--Hearing at first no answer,"
10965,ACT II,I was alarmed.
10966,ACT II,
10967,ACT II,
10968,ACT II,MARMADUKE                    No wonder; this is a place

10970,ACT II,
10971,ACT II,
10972,ACT II,"HERBERT       Why so? a roofless rock had been a comfort,"
10973,ACT II,Storm-beaten and bewildered as we were;
10974,ACT II,"And in a night like this, to lend your cloaks"
10975,ACT II,To make a bed for me!--My Girl will weep
10976,ACT II,When she is told of it.
10977,ACT II,
10978,ACT II,MARMADUKE                            This Daughter of yours
10979,ACT II,Is very dear to you.
10980,ACT II,
10981,ACT II,
10982,ACT II,HERBERT                            Oh! but you are young;
10983,ACT II,"Over your head twice twenty years must roll,"
10984,ACT II,"With all their natural weight of sorrow and pain,"
10985,ACT II,Ere can be known to you how much a Father
10986,ACT II,May love his Child.
10987,ACT II,
10988,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE
10989,MARMADUKE,"Thank you, old Man, for this! [Aside.]"

10993,MARMADUKE,"Kindly have you protected me to-night,"
10994,MARMADUKE,And no return have I to make but prayers;
10995,MARMADUKE,May you in age be blest with such a daughter!--
10996,MARMADUKE,When from the Holy Land I had returned
10997,MARMADUKE,"Sightless, and from my heritage was driven,"
10998,MARMADUKE,A wretched Outcast--but this strain of thought
10999,MARMADUKE,Would lead me to talk fondly.

11002,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                                   Do not fear;

11004,MARMADUKE,
11005,MARMADUKE,
11006,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT       You will forgive me, but my heart runs over."
11007,MARMADUKE,When my old Leader slipped into the flood
11008,MARMADUKE,"And perished, what a piercing outcry you"
11009,MARMADUKE,Sent after him. I have loved you ever since.
11010,MARMADUKE,You start--where are we?
11011,MARMADUKE,
11012,MARMADUKE,
11013,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE                             Oh, there is no danger;"

11026,HERBERT,
11027,HERBERT,"HERBERT       I turned me from the dwellings of my Fathers,"
11028,HERBERT,Where none but those who trampled on my rights
11029,HERBERT,Seemed to remember me. To the wide world
11030,HERBERT,"I bore her, in my arms; her looks won pity;"
11031,HERBERT,"She was my Raven in the wilderness,"
11032,HERBERT,And brought me food. Have I not cause to love her?

11056,HERBERT,"A charming beverage for you to carouse,"
11057,HERBERT,This bitter night.
11058,HERBERT,
11059,HERBERT,
11060,HERBERT,HERBERT                          Ha! Oswald! ten bright crosses
11061,HERBERT,"I would have given, not many minutes gone,"
11062,HERBERT,To have heard your voice.
11063,HERBERT,
11064,HERBERT,
11065,HERBERT,"OSWALD                              Your couch, I fear, good Baron,"
11066,HERBERT,"Has been but comfortless; and yet that place,"
11067,HERBERT,"When the tempestuous wind first drove us hither,"
11068,HERBERT,Felt warm as a wren's nest. You'd better turn
11069,HERBERT,"And under covert rest till break of day,"
11070,HERBERT,Or till the storm abate.
11071,HERBERT,(To MARMADUKE aside.) He has restored you.
11072,HERBERT,No doubt you have been nobly entertained?
11073,HERBERT,But soft!--how came he forth? The Night-mare Conscience
11074,HERBERT,Has driven him out of harbour?
11075,HERBERT,
11076,HERBERT,
11077,HERBERT,MARMADUKE                                   I believe
11078,HERBERT,You have guessed right.
11079,HERBERT,
11080,HERBERT,
11081,HERBERT,HERBERT                              The trees renew their murmur:
11082,HERBERT,"Come, let us house together."
11083,HERBERT,
11084,HERBERT,
11085,HERBERT,[OSWALD conducts him to the dungeon.]
11086,HERBERT,
11087,HERBERT,
11088,HERBERT,OSWALD (returns)
11089,HERBERT,Had I not
11090,HERBERT,Esteemed you worthy to conduct the affair
11091,HERBERT,"To its most fit conclusion, do you think"
11092,HERBERT,"I would so long have struggled with my Nature,"
11093,HERBERT,And smothered all that's man in me?--away!--
11094,HERBERT,[Looking towards the dungeon.]
11095,HERBERT,This man's the property of him who best
11096,HERBERT,Can feel his crimes. I have resigned a privilege;
11097,HERBERT,It now becomes my duty to resume it.
11098,HERBERT,
11099,HERBERT,
11100,HERBERT,MARMADUKE     Touch not a finger--
11101,HERBERT,
11102,HERBERT,
11103,HERBERT,OSWALD                             What then must be done?
11104,HERBERT,
11105,HERBERT,
11106,HERBERT,"MARMADUKE     Which way soe'er I turn, I am perplexed."
11107,HERBERT,
11108,HERBERT,
11109,HERBERT,"OSWALD        Now, on my life, I grieve for you. The misery"
11110,HERBERT,"Of doubt is insupportable. Pity, the facts"
11111,HERBERT,Did not admit of stronger evidence;
11112,HERBERT,"Twelve honest men, plain men, would set us right;"
11113,HERBERT,Their verdict would abolish these weak scruples.
11114,HERBERT,
11115,HERBERT,
11116,HERBERT,"MARMADUKE     Weak! I am weak--there does my torment lie,"
11117,HERBERT,Feeding itself.
11118,HERBERT,
11119,HERBERT,
11120,HERBERT,"OSWALD                          Verily, when he said"
11121,HERBERT,"How his old heart would leap to hear her steps,"
11122,HERBERT,You thought his voice the echo of Idonea's.
11123,HERBERT,
11124,HERBERT,
11125,HERBERT,MARMADUKE     And never heard a sound so terrible.
11126,HERBERT,
11127,HERBERT,
11128,HERBERT,OSWALD        Perchance you think so now?
11129,HERBERT,
11130,HERBERT,
11131,HERBERT,MARMADUKE                                  I cannot do it:
11132,HERBERT,"Twice did I spring to grasp his withered throat,"
11133,HERBERT,"When such a sudden weakness fell upon me,"
11134,HERBERT,I could have dropped asleep upon his breast.
11135,HERBERT,
11136,HERBERT,
11137,HERBERT,OSWALD        Justice--is there not thunder in the word?
11138,HERBERT,Shall it be law to stab the petty robber
11139,HERBERT,Who aims but at our purse; and shall this Parricide--
11140,HERBERT,"Worse is he far, far worse (if foul dishonour"
11141,HERBERT,Be worse than death) to that confiding Creature
11142,HERBERT,Whom he to more than filial love and duty
11143,HERBERT,Hath falsely trained--shall he fulfil his purpose?
11144,HERBERT,But you are fallen.
11145,HERBERT,
11146,HERBERT,
11147,HERBERT,MARMADUKE                         Fallen should I be indeed--
11148,HERBERT,"Murder--perhaps asleep, blind, old, alone,"
11149,HERBERT,"Betrayed, in darkness! Here to strike the blow--"
11150,HERBERT,Away! away!--
11151,HERBERT,
11152,HERBERT,[Flings away his sword.]
11153,HERBERT,
11154,HERBERT,
11155,HERBERT,"OSWALD                       Nay, I have done with you:"
11156,HERBERT,"We'll lead him to the Convent. He shall live,"
11157,HERBERT,And she shall love him. With unquestioned title
11158,HERBERT,"He shall be seated in his Barony,"
11159,HERBERT,And we too chant the praise of his good deeds.
11160,HERBERT,"I now perceive we do mistake our masters,"
11161,HERBERT,And most despise the men who best can teach us:
11162,HERBERT,Henceforth it shall be said that bad men only
11163,HERBERT,Are brave: Clifford is brave; and that old Man
11164,HERBERT,Is brave.
11165,HERBERT,[Taking MARMADUKE'S sword and giving it to him.]
11166,HERBERT,To Clifford's arms he would have led
11167,HERBERT,His Victim--haply to this desolate house.
11168,HERBERT,
11169,HERBERT,
11170,HERBERT,MARMADUKE (advancing to the dungeon)
11171,HERBERT,It must be ended!--
11172,HERBERT,
11173,HERBERT,
11174,HERBERT,OSWALD                           Softly; do not rouse him;
11175,HERBERT,He will deny it to the last. He lies
11176,HERBERT,"Within the Vault, a spear's length to the left."
11177,HERBERT,[MARMADUKE descends to the dungeon.]
11178,HERBERT,(Alone.) The Villains rose in mutiny to destroy me;
11179,HERBERT,"I could have quelled the Cowards, but this Stripling"
11180,HERBERT,"Must needs step in, and save my life. The look"
11181,HERBERT,With which he gave the boon--I see it now!
11182,HERBERT,The same that tempted me to loathe the gift.--
11183,HERBERT,For this old venerable Grey-beard--faith
11184,HERBERT,'Tis his own fault if he hath got a face
11185,HERBERT,Which doth play tricks with them that look on it:
11186,HERBERT,'Twas this that put it in my thoughts--that countenance--
11187,HERBERT,"His staff--his figure--Murder!--what, of whom?"
11188,HERBERT,"We kill a worn-out horse, and who but women"
11189,HERBERT,"Sigh at the deed? Hew down a withered tree,"
11190,HERBERT,And none look grave but dotards. He may live
11191,HERBERT,"To thank me for this service. Rainbow arches,"
11192,HERBERT,"Highways of dreaming passion, have too long,"
11193,HERBERT,"Young as he is, diverted wish and hope"
11194,HERBERT,From the unpretending ground we mortals tread;--
11195,HERBERT,"Then shatter the delusion, break it up"
11196,HERBERT,And set him free. What follows? I have learned
11197,HERBERT,That things will work to ends the slaves o' the world
11198,HERBERT,Do never dream of. I _have_ been what he--
11199,HERBERT,This Boy--when he comes forth with bloody hands--
11200,HERBERT,"Might envy, and am now,--but he shall know"
11201,HERBERT,What I am now--
11202,HERBERT,[Goes and listens at the dungeon.]
11203,HERBERT,Praying or parleying?--tut!
11204,HERBERT,Is he not eyeless? He has been half-dead
11205,HERBERT,These fifteen years--
11206,HERBERT,
11207,HERBERT,[Enter female Beggar with two or three of her Companions.]
11208,HERBERT,
11209,HERBERT,(Turning abruptly.) Ha! speak--what Thing art thou?
11210,HERBERT,(Recognises her.) Heavens! my good friend!    [To her.]
11211,HERBERT,
11212,HERBERT,
11213,HERBERT,"BEGGAR                               Forgive me, gracious Sir!--"
11214,HERBERT,
11215,HERBERT,
11216,HERBERT,OSWALD (to her companions)
11217,HERBERT,"Begone, ye Slaves, or I will raise a whirlwind"
11218,HERBERT,"And send ye dancing to the clouds, like leaves."
11219,HERBERT,[They retire affrighted.]
11220,HERBERT,
11221,HERBERT,
11222,HERBERT,BEGGAR        Indeed we meant no harm; we lodge sometimes
11223,HERBERT,In this deserted Castle--_I repent me._
11224,HERBERT,
11225,HERBERT,
11226,HERBERT,[OSWALD goes to the dungeon--listens--returns to the Beggar.]
11227,HERBERT,
11228,HERBERT,
11229,HERBERT,"OSWALD        Woman, thou hast a helpless Infant--keep"
11230,HERBERT,"Thy secret for its sake, or verily"
11231,HERBERT,That wretched life of thine shall be the forfeit.
11232,HERBERT,
11233,HERBERT,
11234,HERBERT,"BEGGAR        I _do_ repent me, Sir; I fear the curse"
11235,HERBERT,"Of that blind Man. 'Twas not your money, Sir,--"
11236,HERBERT,
11237,HERBERT,
11238,HERBERT,OSWALD        Begone!
11239,HERBERT,
11240,HERBERT,
11241,HERBERT,BEGGAR (going)
11242,HERBERT,There is some wicked deed in hand:
11243,HERBERT,[Aside.]
11244,HERBERT,Would I could find the old Man and his Daughter.
11245,HERBERT,
11246,HERBERT,
11247,HERBERT,[Exit Beggar.]
11248,HERBERT,
11249,HERBERT,
11250,HERBERT,[MARMADUKE re-enters from the dungeon]
11251,HERBERT,
11252,HERBERT,
11253,HERBERT,OSWALD        It is all over then;--your foolish fears
11254,HERBERT,"Are hushed to sleep, by your own act and deed,"
11255,HERBERT,Made quiet as he is.
11256,HERBERT,
11257,HERBERT,
11258,HERBERT,MARMADUKE                           Why came you down?
11259,HERBERT,And when I felt your hand upon my arm
11260,HERBERT,"And spake to you, why did you give no answer?"
11261,HERBERT,Feared you to waken him? he must have been
11262,HERBERT,In a deep sleep. I whispered to him thrice.
11263,HERBERT,There are the strangest echoes in that place!
11264,HERBERT,
11265,HERBERT,
11266,HERBERT,OSWALD        Tut! let them gabble till the day of doom.
11267,HERBERT,
11268,HERBERT,
11269,HERBERT,"MARMADUKE     Scarcely, by groping, had I reached the Spot,"
11270,HERBERT,"When round my wrist I felt a cord drawn tight,"
11271,HERBERT,As if the blind Man's dog were pulling at it.
11272,HERBERT,
11273,HERBERT,
11274,HERBERT,OSWALD        But after that?
11275,HERBERT,
11276,HERBERT,
11277,HERBERT,MARMADUKE                     The features of Idonea
11278,HERBERT,Lurked in his face--
11279,HERBERT,
11280,HERBERT,OSWALD                             Psha! Never to these eyes
11281,HERBERT,Will retribution show itself again
11282,HERBERT,With aspect so inviting. Why forbid me
11283,HERBERT,To share your triumph?
11284,HERBERT,
11285,HERBERT,
11286,HERBERT,"MARMADUKE                            Yes, her very look,"
11287,HERBERT,Smiling in sleep--
11288,HERBERT,
11289,HERBERT,
11290,HERBERT,OSWALD                          A pretty feat of Fancy!
11291,HERBERT,
11292,HERBERT,
11293,HERBERT,"MARMADUKE     Though but a glimpse, it sent me to my prayers."
11294,HERBERT,
11295,HERBERT,
11296,HERBERT,OSWALD        Is he alive?
11297,HERBERT,
11298,HERBERT,
11299,HERBERT,MARMADUKE                  What mean you? who alive?
11300,HERBERT,
11301,HERBERT,
11302,HERBERT,"OSWALD        Herbert! since you will have it, Baron Herbert;"
11303,HERBERT,He who will gain his Seignory when Idonea
11304,HERBERT,Hath become Clifford's harlot--is _he_ living?
11305,HERBERT,
11306,HERBERT,
11307,HERBERT,MARMADUKE     The old Man in that dungeon _is_ alive.
11308,HERBERT,
11309,HERBERT,
11310,HERBERT,"OSWALD        Henceforth, then, will I never in camp or field"
11311,HERBERT,"Obey you more. Your weakness, to the Band,"
11312,HERBERT,"Shall be proclaimed: brave Men, they all shall hear it."
11313,HERBERT,You a protector of humanity!
11314,HERBERT,Avenger you of outraged innocence!
11315,HERBERT,
11316,HERBERT,
11317,HERBERT,"MARMADUKE     'Twas dark--dark as the grave; yet did I see,"
11318,HERBERT,Saw him--his face turned toward me; and I tell thee
11319,HERBERT,Idonea's filial countenance was there
11320,HERBERT,To baffle me--it put me to my prayers.
11321,HERBERT,"Upwards I cast my eyes, and, through a crevice,"
11322,HERBERT,"Beheld a star twinkling above my head,"
11323,HERBERT,"And, by the living God, I could not do it."
11324,HERBERT,[Sinks exhausted.]
11325,HERBERT,
11326,HERBERT,
11327,HERBERT,OSWALD (to himself)
11328,HERBERT,Now may I perish if this turn do more
11329,HERBERT,Than make me change my course.
11330,HERBERT,"(To MARMADUKE.)                       Dear Marmaduke,"
11331,HERBERT,My words were rashly spoken; I recal them:
11332,HERBERT,I feel my error; shedding human blood
11333,HERBERT,Is a most serious thing.
11334,HERBERT,
11335,HERBERT,
11336,HERBERT,"MARMADUKE                               Not I alone,"
11337,HERBERT,Thou too art deep in guilt.
11338,HERBERT,
11339,HERBERT,
11340,HERBERT,OSWALD                                    We have indeed
11341,HERBERT,"Been most presumptuous. There _is_ guilt in this,"
11342,HERBERT,Else could so strong a mind have ever known
11343,HERBERT,These trepidations? Plain it is that Heaven
11344,HERBERT,Has marked out this foul Wretch as one whose crimes
11345,HERBERT,"Must never come before a mortal judgment-seat,"
11346,HERBERT,Or be chastised by mortal instruments.
11347,HERBERT,
11348,HERBERT,
11349,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE
11350,MARMADUKE,A thought that's worth a thousand worlds!
11351,MARMADUKE,
11352,MARMADUKE,[Goes towards the dungeon.]
11353,MARMADUKE,
11354,MARMADUKE,
11355,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                                                  I grieve
11356,MARMADUKE,"That, in my zeal, I have caused you so much pain."
11357,MARMADUKE,
11358,MARMADUKE,
11359,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE      Think not of that! 'tis over--we are safe.
11360,MARMADUKE,
11361,MARMADUKE,
11362,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD (as if to himself, yet speaking aloud)"
11363,MARMADUKE,"The truth is hideous, but how stifle it?"
11364,MARMADUKE,[Turning to MARMADUKE.]
11365,MARMADUKE,"Give me your sword--nay, here are stones and fragments,"
11366,MARMADUKE,The least of which would beat out a man's brains;
11367,MARMADUKE,Or you might drive your head against that wall.
11368,MARMADUKE,No! this is not the place to hear the tale:
11369,MARMADUKE,"It should be told you pinioned in your bed,"
11370,MARMADUKE,Or on some vast and solitary plain
11371,MARMADUKE,Blown to you from a trumpet.
11372,MARMADUKE,
11373,MARMADUKE,
11374,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                                  Why talk thus?
11375,MARMADUKE,Whate'er the monster brooding in your breast
11376,MARMADUKE,"I care not: fear I have none, and cannot fear--"
11377,MARMADUKE,[The sound of a horn is heard.]
11378,MARMADUKE,That horn again--'Tis some one of our Troop;
11379,MARMADUKE,What do they here? Listen!
11380,MARMADUKE,
11381,MARMADUKE,
11382,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                                  What! dogged like thieves!
11383,MARMADUKE,
11384,MARMADUKE,
11385,MARMADUKE,"[Enter WALLACE and LACY, etc.]"
11386,MARMADUKE,
11387,MARMADUKE,
11388,MARMADUKE,"LACY          You are found at last, thanks to the vagrant Troop"
11389,MARMADUKE,For not misleading us.
11390,MARMADUKE,
11391,MARMADUKE,
11392,MARMADUKE,OSWALD (looking at WALLACE)
11393,MARMADUKE,That subtle Greybeard--
11394,MARMADUKE,I'd rather see my father's ghost.
11395,MARMADUKE,
11396,MARMADUKE,
11397,MARMADUKE,LACY (to MARMADUKE)
11398,MARMADUKE,"My Captain,"
11399,MARMADUKE,We come by order of the Band. Belike
11400,MARMADUKE,You have not heard that Henry has at last
11401,MARMADUKE,"Dissolved the Barons' League, and sent abroad"
11402,MARMADUKE,His Sheriffs with fit force to reinstate
11403,MARMADUKE,The genuine owners of such Lands and Baronies
11404,MARMADUKE,"As, in these long commotions, have been seized."
11405,MARMADUKE,His Power is this way tending. It befits us
11406,MARMADUKE,"To stand upon our guard, and with our swords"
11407,MARMADUKE,Defend the innocent.
11408,MARMADUKE,
11409,MARMADUKE,
11410,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                             Lacy! we look
11411,MARMADUKE,But at the surfaces of things; we hear
11412,MARMADUKE,"Of towns in flames, fields ravaged, young and old"
11413,MARMADUKE,Driven out in troops to want and nakedness;
11414,MARMADUKE,Then grasp our swords and rush upon a cure
11415,MARMADUKE,"That flatters us, because it asks not thought:"
11416,MARMADUKE,The deeper malady is better hid;
11417,MARMADUKE,The world is poisoned at the heart.
11418,MARMADUKE,
11419,MARMADUKE,
11420,MARMADUKE,LACY                                              What mean you?
11421,MARMADUKE,
11422,MARMADUKE,
11423,MARMADUKE,WALLACE (whose eye has been fixed suspiciously upon OSWALD)
11424,MARMADUKE,"Ay, what is it you mean?"
11425,MARMADUKE,
11426,MARMADUKE,
11427,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE                             Hark'ee, my Friends;--"
11428,MARMADUKE,[Appearing gay.]
11429,MARMADUKE,"Were there a Man who, being weak and helpless"
11430,MARMADUKE,"And most forlorn, should bribe a Mother, pressed"
11431,MARMADUKE,"By penury, to yield him up her Daughter,"
11432,MARMADUKE,"A little Infant, and instruct the Babe,"
11433,MARMADUKE,"Prattling upon his knee, to call him Father--"
11434,MARMADUKE,
11435,MARMADUKE,
11436,MARMADUKE,"LACY          Why, if his heart be tender, that offence"
11437,MARMADUKE,I could forgive him.
11438,MARMADUKE,
11439,MARMADUKE,
11440,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE (going on)
11441,MARMADUKE,And should he make the Child
11442,MARMADUKE,"An instrument of falsehood, should he teach her"
11443,MARMADUKE,"To stretch her arms, and dim the gladsome light"
11444,MARMADUKE,Of infant playfulness with piteous looks
11445,MARMADUKE,Of misery that was not--
11446,MARMADUKE,
11447,LACY,LACY
11448,LACY,"Troth, 'tis hard--"
11449,LACY,But in a world like ours--
11450,LACY,
11451,LACY,
11452,LACY,MARMADUKE (changing his tone)
11453,LACY,This self-same Man--
11454,LACY,Even while he printed kisses on the cheek
11455,LACY,"Of this poor Babe, and taught its innocent tongue"
11456,LACY,To lisp the name of Father--could he look
11457,LACY,To the unnatural harvest of that time
11458,LACY,"When he should give her up, a Woman grown,"
11459,LACY,To him who bid the highest in the market
11460,LACY,Of foul pollution--
11461,LACY,
11462,LACY,
11463,LACY,LACY                               The whole visible world
11464,LACY,Contains not such a Monster!
11465,LACY,
11466,LACY,
11467,LACY,MARMADUKE                                   For this purpose
11468,LACY,Should he resolve to taint her Soul by means
11469,LACY,Which bathe the limbs in sweat to think of them;
11470,LACY,"Should he, by tales which would draw tears from iron,"
11471,LACY,"Work on her nature, and so turn compassion"
11472,LACY,"And gratitude to ministers of vice,"
11473,LACY,And make the spotless spirit of filial love
11474,LACY,Prime mover in a plot to damn his Victim
11475,LACY,Both soul and body--
11476,LACY,
11477,LACY,
11478,LACY,WALLACE                           'Tis too horrible;
11479,LACY,"Oswald, what say you to it?"
11480,LACY,
11481,LACY,
11482,LACY,"LACY                                      Hew him down,"
11483,LACY,And fling him to the ravens.
11484,LACY,
11485,LACY,
11486,LACY,MARMADUKE                                  But his aspect
11487,LACY,"It is so meek, his countenance so venerable."
11488,LACY,
11489,LACY,
11490,LACY,WALLACE (with an appearance of mistrust)
11491,LACY,"But how, what say you, Oswald?"
11492,LACY,
11493,LACY,
11494,LACY,LACY (at the same moment)
11495,LACY,"Stab him, were it"
11496,LACY,Before the Altar.
11497,LACY,
11498,LACY,
11499,LACY,"MARMADUKE                       What, if he were sick,"
11500,LACY,"Tottering upon the very verge of life,"
11501,LACY,"And old, and blind--"
11502,LACY,
11503,LACY,

11506,LACY,
11507,LACY,OSWALD (coming forward)
11508,LACY,"Are we Men,"
11509,LACY,Or own we baby Spirits? Genuine courage
11510,LACY,"Is not an accidental quality,"
11511,LACY,A thing dependent for its casual birth
11512,LACY,On opposition and impediment.
11513,LACY,"Wisdom, if Justice speak the word, beats down"
11514,LACY,"The giant's strength; and, at the voice of Justice,"
11515,LACY,Spares not the worm. The giant and the worm--
11516,LACY,"She weighs them in one scale. The wiles of woman,"
11517,LACY,"And craft of age, seducing reason, first"
11518,LACY,"Made weakness a protection, and obscured"
11519,LACY,The moral shapes of things. His tender cries
11520,LACY,And helpless innocence--do they protect
11521,LACY,"The infant lamb? and shall the infirmities,"
11522,LACY,Which have enabled this enormous Culprit
11523,LACY,"To perpetrate his crimes, serve as a Sanctuary"
11524,LACY,"To cover him from punishment? Shame!--Justice,"
11525,LACY,"Admitting no resistance, bends alike"
11526,LACY,The feeble and the strong. She needs not here
11527,LACY,"Her bonds and chains, which make the mighty feeble."
11528,LACY,--We recognise in this old Man a victim
11529,LACY,Prepared already for the sacrifice.
11530,LACY,
11531,LACY,
11532,LACY,"LACY          By heaven, his words are reason!"

11536,LACY,His countenance is meek and venerable;
11537,LACY,"And, by the Mass, to see him at his prayers!--"
11538,LACY,"I am of flesh and blood, and may I perish"
11539,LACY,When my heart does not ache to think of it!--
11540,LACY,Poor Victim! not a virtue under heaven
11541,LACY,But what was made an engine to ensnare thee;
11542,LACY,"But yet I trust, Idonea, thou art safe."
11543,LACY,
11544,LACY,
11545,LACY,LACY          Idonea!
11546,LACY,
11547,LACY,
11548,LACY,WALLACE               How! What? your Idonea?
11549,LACY,[To MARMADUKE.]
11550,LACY,

11552,LACY,MARMADUKE                                      _Mine;_
11553,LACY,But now no longer mine. You know Lord Clifford;
11554,LACY,He is the Man to whom the Maiden--pure
11555,LACY,"As beautiful, and gentle and benign,"
11556,LACY,And in her ample heart loving even me--
11557,LACY,Was to be yielded up.
11558,LACY,
11559,LACY,
11560,LACY,"LACY                               Now, by the head"
11561,LACY,"Of my own child, this Man must die; my hand,"
11562,LACY,"A worthier wanting, shall itself entwine"
11563,LACY,In his grey hairs!--
11564,LACY,
11565,LACY,
11566,LACY,MARMADUKE (to LACY)
11567,LACY,I love the Father in thee.

11569,LACY,"And I have felt, more than perhaps becomes me"
11570,LACY,Or duty sanctions.

11572,LACY,
11573,LACY,LACY                             We will have ample justice.
11574,LACY,"Who are we, Friends? Do we not live on ground"
11575,LACY,"Where Souls are self-defended, free to grow"
11576,LACY,Like mountain oaks rocked by the stormy wind?
11577,LACY,"Mark the Almighty Wisdom, which decreed"
11578,LACY,"This monstrous crime to be laid open--_here,_"
11579,LACY,"Where Reason has an eye that she can use,"
11580,LACY,And Men alone are Umpires. To the Camp
11581,LACY,"He shall be led, and there, the Country round"
11582,LACY,"All gathered to the spot, in open day"
11583,LACY,Shall Nature be avenged.

11588,LACY,
11589,LACY,
11590,LACY,MARMADUKE (to LACY)
11591,LACY,I thank you for that hint. He shall be brought
11592,LACY,"Before the Camp, and would that best and wisest"
11593,LACY,"Of every country might be present. There,"
11594,LACY,His crime shall be proclaimed; and for the rest
11595,LACY,It shall be done as Wisdom shall decide:
11596,LACY,"Meanwhile, do you two hasten back and see"
11597,LACY,That all is well prepared.
11598,LACY,
11599,LACY,
11600,LACY,WALLACE                                  We will obey you.
11601,LACY,(Aside.) But softly! we must look a little nearer.
11602,LACY,
11603,LACY,
11604,LACY,MARMADUKE     Tell where you found us. At some future time

11648,HOST,"Oh, Wisdom! a most wise resolve! and then,"
11649,HOST,That half a word should blow it to the winds!
11650,HOST,This last device must end my work.--Methinks
11651,HOST,It were a pleasant pastime to construct
11652,HOST,A scale and table of belief--as thus--
11653,HOST,"Two columns, one for passion, one for proof;"

11707,MARMADUKE,"Said one, ""It is agreed on. The blind Man"

11713,MARMADUKE,"They say, Lord Clifford is a savage man;"

11715,MARMADUKE,"Fitting his low voice to the minstrel's harp,"
11716,MARMADUKE,There's witchery in't. I never knew a maid
11717,MARMADUKE,"That could withstand it. True,"" continued he,"
11718,MARMADUKE,"""When we arranged the affair, she wept a little"
11719,MARMADUKE,(Not the less welcome to my Lord for that)
11720,MARMADUKE,"And said, 'My Father he will have it so.'"""
11721,MARMADUKE,
11722,MARMADUKE,
11723,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     I am your hearer.

11725,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD                         This I caught, and more"
11726,MARMADUKE,That may not be retold to any ear.
11727,MARMADUKE,The obstinate bolt of a small iron door
11728,MARMADUKE,Detained them near the gateway of the Castle.
11729,MARMADUKE,By a dim lantern's light I saw that wreaths
11730,MARMADUKE,"Of flowers were in their hands, as if designed"
11731,MARMADUKE,"For festive decoration; and they said,"
11732,MARMADUKE,"With brutal laughter and most foul allusion,"
11733,MARMADUKE,That they should share the banquet with their Lord
11734,MARMADUKE,And his new Favorite.

11741,MARMADUKE,"How you would be disturbed by this dire news,"
11742,MARMADUKE,"And therefore chose this solitary Moor,"
11743,MARMADUKE,"Here to impart the tale, of which, last night,"
11744,MARMADUKE,"I strove to ease my mind, when our two Comrades,"
11745,MARMADUKE,"Commissioned by the Band, burst in upon us."

11747,MARMADUKE,
11748,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     Last night, when moved to lift the avenging steel,"
11749,MARMADUKE,"I did believe all things were shadows--yea,"
11750,MARMADUKE,"Living or dead all things were bodiless,"
11751,MARMADUKE,"Or but the mutual mockeries of body,"
11752,MARMADUKE,Till that same star summoned me back again.
11753,MARMADUKE,Now I could laugh till my ribs ached.    Fool!
11754,MARMADUKE,"To let a creed, built in the heart of things,"
11755,MARMADUKE,"Dissolve before a twinkling atom!--Oswald,"
11756,MARMADUKE,I could fetch lessons out of wiser schools
11757,MARMADUKE,"Than you have entered, were it worth the pains."
11758,MARMADUKE,"Young as I am, I might go forth a teacher,"
11759,MARMADUKE,And you should see how deeply I could reason
11760,MARMADUKE,"Of love in all its shapes, beginnings, ends;"
11761,MARMADUKE,Of moral qualities in their diverse aspects;
11762,MARMADUKE,"Of actions, and their laws and tendencies."

11769,MARMADUKE,"General or Cham, Sultan or Emperor,"
11770,MARMADUKE,Strews twenty acres of good meadow-ground
11771,MARMADUKE,"With carcases, in lineament and shape"
11772,MARMADUKE,"And substance, nothing differing from his own,"
11773,MARMADUKE,But that they cannot stand up of themselves;
11774,MARMADUKE,"Another sits i' th' sun, and by the hour"
11775,MARMADUKE,Floats kingcups in the brook--a Hero one
11776,MARMADUKE,"We call, and scorn the other as Time's spendthrift;"
11777,MARMADUKE,But have they not a world of common ground
11778,MARMADUKE,"To occupy--both fools, or wise alike,"
11779,MARMADUKE,Each in his way?

11781,MARMADUKE,

11783,MARMADUKE,
11784,MARMADUKE,
11785,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     Now for the corner-stone of my philosophy:
11786,MARMADUKE,I would not give a denier for the man
11787,MARMADUKE,"Who, on such provocation as this earth"
11788,MARMADUKE,"Yields, could not chuck his babe beneath the chin,"
11789,MARMADUKE,And send it with a fillip to its grave.
11790,MARMADUKE,

11808,MARMADUKE,
11809,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     Oh yes, that mole, that viper in the path;"

11820,MARMADUKE,I will stroll on; you follow when 'tis done.
11821,MARMADUKE,
11822,MARMADUKE,
11823,MARMADUKE,[Exeunt.]
11824,MARMADUKE,
11825,MARMADUKE,
11826,MARMADUKE,SCENE changes to another part of the Moor at a short distance--HERBERT
11827,MARMADUKE,is discovered seated on a stone
11828,MARMADUKE,
11829,MARMADUKE,
11830,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT       A sound of laughter, too!--'tis well--I feared,"
11831,MARMADUKE,The Stranger had some pitiable sorrow
11832,MARMADUKE,Pressing upon his solitary heart.
11833,MARMADUKE,Hush!--'tis the feeble and earth-loving wind
11834,MARMADUKE,That creeps along the bells of the crisp heather.
11835,MARMADUKE,Alas! 'tis cold--I shiver in the sunshine--
11836,MARMADUKE,What can this mean? There is a psalm that speaks
11837,MARMADUKE,Of God's parental mercies--with Idonea
11838,MARMADUKE,I used to sing it.--Listen!--what foot is there?
11839,MARMADUKE,
11840,MARMADUKE,
11841,MARMADUKE,[Enter MARMADUKE]
11842,MARMADUKE,
11843,MARMADUKE,
11844,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE (aside--looking at HERBERT)
11845,MARMADUKE,And I have loved this Man! and _she_ hath loved him!
11846,MARMADUKE,"And I loved her, and she loves the Lord Clifford!"
11847,MARMADUKE,And there it ends;--if this be not enough
11848,MARMADUKE,"To make mankind merry for evermore,"
11849,MARMADUKE,"Then plain it is as day, that eyes were made"
11850,MARMADUKE,For a wise purpose--verily to weep with!
11851,MARMADUKE,[Looking round.]
11852,MARMADUKE,"A pretty prospect this, a masterpiece"
11853,MARMADUKE,"Of Nature, finished with most curious skill!"
11854,MARMADUKE,"(To HERBERT.) Good Baron, have you ever practised tillage?"
11855,MARMADUKE,Pray tell me what this land is worth by the acre?
11856,MARMADUKE,
11857,MARMADUKE,
11858,MARMADUKE,HERBERT       How glad I am to hear your voice! I know not
11859,MARMADUKE,Wherein I have offended you;--last night
11860,MARMADUKE,I found in you the kindest of Protectors;
11861,MARMADUKE,"This morning, when I spoke of weariness,"
11862,MARMADUKE,You from my shoulder took my scrip and threw it
11863,MARMADUKE,About your own; but for these two hours past
11864,MARMADUKE,"Once only have you spoken, when the lark"
11865,MARMADUKE,"Whirred from among the fern beneath our feet,"
11866,MARMADUKE,"And I, no coward in my better days,"
11867,MARMADUKE,Was almost terrified.
11868,MARMADUKE,
11869,MARMADUKE,
11870,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                          That's excellent!--
11871,MARMADUKE,"So, you bethought you of the many ways"
11872,MARMADUKE,"In which a man may come to his end, whose crimes"
11873,MARMADUKE,Have roused all Nature up against him--pshaw!--
11874,MARMADUKE,
11875,MARMADUKE,
11876,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT       For mercy's sake, is nobody in sight?"
11877,MARMADUKE,"No traveller, peasant, herdsman?"
11878,MARMADUKE,
11879,MARMADUKE,
11880,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                                     Not a soul:
11881,MARMADUKE,"Here is a tree, raggèd, and bent, and bare,"
11882,MARMADUKE,That turns its goat's-beard flakes of pea-green moss
11883,MARMADUKE,From the stern breathing of the rough sea-wind;
11884,MARMADUKE,"This have we, but no other company:"
11885,MARMADUKE,Commend me to the place. If a man should die
11886,MARMADUKE,"And leave his body here, it were all one"
11887,MARMADUKE,As he were twenty fathoms underground.
11888,MARMADUKE,
11889,MARMADUKE,
11890,MARMADUKE,HERBERT       Where is our common Friend?
11891,MARMADUKE,
11892,MARMADUKE,
11893,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE                                 A ghost, methinks--"
11894,MARMADUKE,"The Spirit of a murdered man, for instance--"
11895,MARMADUKE,"Might have fine room to ramble about here,"
11896,MARMADUKE,A grand domain to squeak and gibber in.
11897,MARMADUKE,
11898,MARMADUKE,
11899,MARMADUKE,HERBERT       Lost Man! if thou have any close-pent guilt
11900,MARMADUKE,"Pressing upon thy heart, and this the hour"
11901,MARMADUKE,Of visitation--
11902,MARMADUKE,
11903,MARMADUKE,
11904,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                     A bold word from _you_!
11905,MARMADUKE,
11906,MARMADUKE,
11907,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT       Restore him, Heaven!"
11908,MARMADUKE,
11909,MARMADUKE,
11910,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE                        The desperate Wretch!--A Flower,"
11911,MARMADUKE,"Fairest of all flowers, was she once, but now"
11912,MARMADUKE,They have snapped her from the stem--Poh! let her lie
11913,MARMADUKE,"Besoiled with mire, and let the houseless snail"
11914,MARMADUKE,"Feed on her leaves. You knew her well--ay, there,"
11915,MARMADUKE,"Old Man! you were a very Lynx, you knew"
11916,MARMADUKE,The worm was in her--
11917,MARMADUKE,
11918,MARMADUKE,
11919,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT                            Mercy! Sir, what mean you?"
11920,MARMADUKE,
11921,MARMADUKE,
11922,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     You have a Daughter!
11923,MARMADUKE,
11924,MARMADUKE,
11925,MARMADUKE,HERBERT                             Oh that she were here!--
11926,MARMADUKE,"She hath an eye that sinks into all hearts,"
11927,MARMADUKE,"And if I have in aught offended you,"
11928,MARMADUKE,Soon would her gentle voice make peace between us.
11929,MARMADUKE,
11930,MARMADUKE,
11931,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE (aside)
11932,MARMADUKE,I do believe he weeps--I could weep too--
11933,MARMADUKE,There is a vein of her voice that runs through his:
11934,MARMADUKE,Even such a Man my fancy bodied forth
11935,MARMADUKE,From the first moment that I loved the Maid;
11936,MARMADUKE,And for his sake I loved her more: these tears--
11937,MARMADUKE,I did not think that aught was left in me
11938,MARMADUKE,"Of what I have been--yes, I thank thee, Heaven!"
11939,MARMADUKE,One happy thought has passed across my mind.
11940,MARMADUKE,--It may not be--I am cut off from man;
11941,MARMADUKE,No more shall I be man--no more shall I
11942,MARMADUKE,Have human feelings!--
11943,MARMADUKE,"(To HERBERT)             --Now, for a little more"
11944,MARMADUKE,About your Daughter!
11945,MARMADUKE,
11946,MARMADUKE,
11947,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT                            Troops of armed men,"
11948,MARMADUKE,"Met in the roads, would bless us; little children,"
11949,MARMADUKE,"Rushing along in the full tide of play,"
11950,MARMADUKE,Stood silent as we passed them! I have heard
11951,MARMADUKE,"The boisterous carman, in the miry road,"
11952,MARMADUKE,"Check his loud whip and hail us with mild voice,"
11953,MARMADUKE,And speak with milder voice to his poor beasts.
11954,MARMADUKE,
11955,MARMADUKE,
11956,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     And whither were you going?
11957,MARMADUKE,
11958,MARMADUKE,
11959,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT                                  Learn, young Man,--"
11960,MARMADUKE,"To fear the virtuous, and reverence misery,"
11961,MARMADUKE,"Whether too much for patience, or, like mine,"
11962,MARMADUKE,Softened till it becomes a gift of mercy.
11963,MARMADUKE,
11964,MARMADUKE,
11965,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     Now, this is as it should be!"
11966,MARMADUKE,
11967,MARMADUKE,
11968,MARMADUKE,HERBERT                                     I am weak!--
11969,MARMADUKE,My Daughter does not know how weak I am;
11970,MARMADUKE,"And, as thou see'st, under the arch of heaven"
11971,MARMADUKE,"Here do I stand, alone, to helplessness,"
11972,MARMADUKE,"By the good God, our common Father, doomed!--"
11973,MARMADUKE,But I had once a spirit and an arm--
11974,MARMADUKE,
11975,MARMADUKE,
11976,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     Now, for a word about your Barony:"
11977,MARMADUKE,"I fancy when you left the Holy Land,"
11978,MARMADUKE,And came to--what's your title--eh? your claims
11979,MARMADUKE,Were undisputed!
11980,MARMADUKE,
11981,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT                        Like a mendicant,"
11982,MARMADUKE,"Whom no one comes to meet, I stood alone;--"
11983,MARMADUKE,"I murmured--but, remembering Him who feeds"
11984,MARMADUKE,"The pelican and ostrich of the desert,"
11985,MARMADUKE,From my own threshold I looked up to Heaven
11986,MARMADUKE,And did not want glimmerings of quiet hope.
11987,MARMADUKE,"So, from the court I passed, and down the brook,"
11988,MARMADUKE,"Led by its murmur, to the ancient oak"
11989,MARMADUKE,"I came; and when I felt its cooling shade,"
11990,MARMADUKE,"I sate me down, and cannot but believe--"
11991,MARMADUKE,While in my lap I held my little Babe
11992,MARMADUKE,"And clasped her to my heart, my heart that ached"
11993,MARMADUKE,More with delight than grief--I heard a voice
11994,MARMADUKE,Such as by Cherith on Elijah called;
11995,MARMADUKE,"It said, ""I will be with thee."" A little boy,"
11996,MARMADUKE,"A shepherd-lad, ere yet my trance was gone,"
11997,MARMADUKE,"Hailed us as if he had been sent from heaven,"
11998,MARMADUKE,"And said, with tears, that he would be our guide:"
11999,MARMADUKE,I had a better guide--that innocent Babe--
12000,MARMADUKE,"Her, who hath saved me, to this hour, from harm,"
12001,MARMADUKE,"From cold, from hunger, penury, and death;"
12002,MARMADUKE,To whom I owe the best of all the good
12003,MARMADUKE,"I have, or wish for, upon earth--and more"
12004,MARMADUKE,And higher far than lies within earth's bounds:
12005,MARMADUKE,"Therefore I bless her: when I think of Man,"
12006,MARMADUKE,"I bless her with sad spirit,--when of God,"
12007,MARMADUKE,I bless her in the fulness of my joy!
12008,MARMADUKE,
12009,MARMADUKE,
12010,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     The name of daughter in his mouth, he prays!"
12011,MARMADUKE,"With nerves so steady, that the very flies"
12012,MARMADUKE,Sit unmolested on his staff.--Innocent!--
12013,MARMADUKE,If he were innocent--then he would tremble
12014,MARMADUKE,"And be disturbed, as I am."
12015,MARMADUKE,(Turning aside.)                    I have read
12016,MARMADUKE,"In Story, what men now alive have witnessed,"
12017,MARMADUKE,"How, when the People's mind was racked with doubt,"
12018,MARMADUKE,Appeal was made to the great Judge: the Accused
12019,MARMADUKE,With naked feet walked over burning ploughshares.
12020,MARMADUKE,Here is a Man by Nature's hand prepared
12021,MARMADUKE,"For a like trial, but more merciful."
12022,MARMADUKE,Why else have I been led to this bleak Waste?
12023,MARMADUKE,"Bare is it, without house or track, and destitute"
12024,MARMADUKE,"Of obvious shelter, as a shipless sea."
12025,MARMADUKE,Here will I leave him--here--All-seeing God!
12026,MARMADUKE,"Such as _he_ is, and sore perplexed as I am,"
12027,MARMADUKE,I will commit him to this final _Ordeal!_--
12028,MARMADUKE,He heard a voice--a shepherd-lad came to him
12029,MARMADUKE,"And was his guide; if once, why not again,"
12030,MARMADUKE,And in this desert? If never--then the whole
12031,MARMADUKE,"Of what he says, and looks, and does, and is,"
12032,MARMADUKE,Makes up one damning falsehood. Leave him here
12033,MARMADUKE,"To cold and hunger!--Pain is of the heart,"
12034,MARMADUKE,And what are a few throes of bodily suffering
12035,MARMADUKE,If they can waken one pang of remorse?
12036,MARMADUKE,[Goes up to HERBERT.]
12037,MARMADUKE,"Old Man! my wrath is as a flame burnt out,"
12038,MARMADUKE,It cannot be rekindled. Thou art here
12039,MARMADUKE,Led by my hand to save thee from perdition:
12040,MARMADUKE,Thou wilt have time to breathe and think--
12041,MARMADUKE,
12042,MARMADUKE,
12043,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT       Oh, Mercy!"
12044,MARMADUKE,
12045,MARMADUKE,
12046,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     I know the need that all men have of mercy,"
12047,MARMADUKE,And therefore leave thee to a righteous judgment.
12048,MARMADUKE,
12049,MARMADUKE,
12050,MARMADUKE,"HERBERT        My Child, my blessèd Child!"
12051,MARMADUKE,
12052,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE      No more of that;
12053,MARMADUKE,Thou wilt have many guides if thou art innocent;
12054,MARMADUKE,"Yea, from the utmost corners of the earth,"
12055,MARMADUKE,That Woman will come o'er this Waste to save thee.
12056,MARMADUKE,[He pauses and looks at HERBERT'S staff.]
12057,MARMADUKE,Ha! what is here? and carved by her own hand!
12058,MARMADUKE,[Reads upon the staff.]
12059,MARMADUKE,"""I am eyes to the blind, saith the Lord."
12060,MARMADUKE,"He that puts his trust in me shall not fail!"""
12061,MARMADUKE,"Yes, be it so;--repent and be forgiven--"
12062,MARMADUKE,God and that staff are now thy only guides.
12063,MARMADUKE,[He leaves HERBERT on the Moor.]

12079,MARMADUKE,
12080,MARMADUKE,LENNOX (to WALLACE)
12081,MARMADUKE,"His tool, the wandering Beggar, made last night"
12082,MARMADUKE,"A plain confession, such as leaves no doubt,"
12083,MARMADUKE,"Knowing what otherwise we know too well,"
12084,MARMADUKE,That she revealed the truth. Stand by me now;
12085,MARMADUKE,For rather would I have a nest of vipers
12086,MARMADUKE,"Between my breast-plate and my skin, than make"
12087,MARMADUKE,"Oswald my special enemy, if you"
12088,MARMADUKE,Deny me your support.

12090,MARMADUKE,
12091,MARMADUKE,LACY                                 We have been fooled--
12092,MARMADUKE,But for the motive?
12093,MARMADUKE,
12094,MARMADUKE,
12095,MARMADUKE,WALLACE                           Natures such as his
12096,MARMADUKE,"Spin motives out of their own bowels, Lacy!"
12097,MARMADUKE,I learn'd this when I was a Confessor.
12098,MARMADUKE,I know him well; there needs no other motive
12099,MARMADUKE,Than that most strange incontinence in crime
12100,MARMADUKE,Which haunts this Oswald. Power is life to him
12101,MARMADUKE,"And breath and being; where he cannot govern,"
12102,MARMADUKE,He will destroy.
12103,MARMADUKE,
12104,MARMADUKE,
12105,MARMADUKE,LACY                          To have been trapped like moles!--
12106,MARMADUKE,"Yes, you are right, we need not hunt for motives:"
12107,MARMADUKE,There is no crime from which this man would shrink;
12108,MARMADUKE,He recks not human law; and I have noticed
12109,MARMADUKE,"That often when the name of God is uttered,"
12110,MARMADUKE,A sudden blankness overspreads his face.
12111,MARMADUKE,
12112,MARMADUKE,
12113,MARMADUKE,"LENNOX        Yet, reasoner as he is, his pride has built"
12114,MARMADUKE,Some uncouth superstition of its own.
12115,MARMADUKE,
12116,MARMADUKE,
12117,MARMADUKE,WALLACE       I have seen traces of it.

12120,MARMADUKE,LENNOX        Once he headed
12121,MARMADUKE,A band of Pirates in the Norway seas;
12122,MARMADUKE,And when the King of Denmark summoned him
12123,MARMADUKE,"To the oath of fealty, I well remember,"
12124,MARMADUKE,"'Twas a strange answer that he made; he said,"

12195,ONE OF THE BAND,"MARMADUKE                             A later meeting, Oswald,"
12196,ONE OF THE BAND,Would have been better timed.

12199,ONE OF THE BAND,"OSWALD                                     Alone, I see;"
12200,ONE OF THE BAND,"You have done your duty. I had hopes, which now"
12201,ONE OF THE BAND,I feel that you will justify.
12202,ONE OF THE BAND,
12203,ONE OF THE BAND,
12204,ONE OF THE BAND,"MARMADUKE                                    I had fears,"
12205,ONE OF THE BAND,From which I have freed myself--but 'tis my wish
12206,ONE OF THE BAND,"To be alone, and therefore we must part."
12207,ONE OF THE BAND,
12208,ONE OF THE BAND,
12209,ONE OF THE BAND,"OSWALD        Nay, then--I am mistaken. There's a weakness"
12210,ONE OF THE BAND,About you still; you talk of solitude--
12211,ONE OF THE BAND,I am your friend.
12212,ONE OF THE BAND,
12213,ONE OF THE BAND,
12214,ONE OF THE BAND,MARMADUKE                       What need of this assurance
12215,ONE OF THE BAND,At any time? and why given now?

12218,ONE OF THE BAND,OSWALD                                         Because
12219,ONE OF THE BAND,You are now in truth my Master; you have taught me
12220,ONE OF THE BAND,What there is not another living man
12221,ONE OF THE BAND,Had strength to teach;--and therefore gratitude
12222,ONE OF THE BAND,"Is bold, and would relieve itself by praise."
12223,ONE OF THE BAND,
12224,ONE OF THE BAND,
12225,ONE OF THE BAND,MARMADUKE     Wherefore press this on me?
12226,ONE OF THE BAND,
12227,ONE OF THE BAND,OSWALD                                     Because I feel
12228,ONE OF THE BAND,"That you have shown, and by a signal instance,"
12229,ONE OF THE BAND,How they who would be just must seek the rule
12230,ONE OF THE BAND,By diving for it into their own bosoms.
12231,ONE OF THE BAND,To-day you have thrown off a tyranny
12232,ONE OF THE BAND,That lives but in the torpid acquiescence
12233,ONE OF THE BAND,"Of our emasculated souls, the tyranny"
12234,ONE OF THE BAND,"Of the world's masters, with the musty rules"
12235,ONE OF THE BAND,By which they uphold their craft from age to age:
12236,ONE OF THE BAND,You have obeyed the only law that sense
12237,ONE OF THE BAND,"Submits to recognise; the immediate law,"
12238,ONE OF THE BAND,"From the clear light of circumstances, flashed"
12239,ONE OF THE BAND,Upon an independent Intellect.
12240,ONE OF THE BAND,Henceforth new prospects open on your path;
12241,ONE OF THE BAND,Your faculties should grow with the demand;
12242,ONE OF THE BAND,"I still will be your friend, will cleave to you"
12243,ONE OF THE BAND,"Through good and evil, obloquy and scorn,"
12244,ONE OF THE BAND,Oft as they dare to follow on your steps.
12245,ONE OF THE BAND,
12246,ONE OF THE BAND,
12247,ONE OF THE BAND,MARMADUKE     I would be left alone.
12248,ONE OF THE BAND,
12249,ONE OF THE BAND,
12250,ONE OF THE BAND,OSWALD (exultingly)
12251,ONE OF THE BAND,I know your motives!
12252,ONE OF THE BAND,"I am not of the world's presumptuous judges,"
12253,ONE OF THE BAND,"Who damn where they can neither see nor feel,"
12254,ONE OF THE BAND,With a hard-hearted ignorance; your struggles
12255,ONE OF THE BAND,"I witness'd, and now hail your victory."
12256,ONE OF THE BAND,
12257,ONE OF THE BAND,
12258,ONE OF THE BAND,MARMADUKE     Spare me awhile that greeting.

12261,ONE OF THE BAND,"OSWALD                                        It may be,"
12262,ONE OF THE BAND,"That some there are, squeamish half-thinking cowards,"
12263,ONE OF THE BAND,"Who will turn pale upon you, call you murderer,"
12264,ONE OF THE BAND,And you will walk in solitude among them.
12265,ONE OF THE BAND,A mighty evil for a strong-built mind!--
12266,ONE OF THE BAND,Join twenty tapers of unequal height
12267,ONE OF THE BAND,"And light them joined, and you will see the less"
12268,ONE OF THE BAND,How 'twill burn down the taller; and they all
12269,ONE OF THE BAND,Shall prey upon the tallest. Solitude!--

12273,ONE OF THE BAND,"MARMADUKE                                   Even so,"
12274,ONE OF THE BAND,"The Sparrow so on the house-top, and I,"
12275,ONE OF THE BAND,"The weakest of God's creatures, stand resolved"
12276,ONE OF THE BAND,"To abide the issue of my act, alone."
12277,ONE OF THE BAND,
12278,ONE OF THE BAND,
12279,ONE OF THE BAND,"OSWALD        _Now_ would you? and for ever?--My young Friend,"
12280,ONE OF THE BAND,As time advances either we become
12281,ONE OF THE BAND,The prey or masters of our own past deeds.
12282,ONE OF THE BAND,"Fellowship we _must_ have, willing or no;"
12283,ONE OF THE BAND,"And if good Angels fail, slack in their duty,"
12284,ONE OF THE BAND,"Substitutes, turn our faces where we may,"
12285,ONE OF THE BAND,"Are still forthcoming; some which, though they bear"
12286,ONE OF THE BAND,"Ill names, can render no ill services,"
12287,ONE OF THE BAND,In recompense for what themselves required.
12288,ONE OF THE BAND,"So meet extremes in this mysterious world,"
12289,ONE OF THE BAND,And opposites thus melt into each other.
12290,ONE OF THE BAND,
12291,ONE OF THE BAND,
12292,ONE OF THE BAND,"MARMADUKE     Time, since Man first drew breath, has never moved"
12293,ONE OF THE BAND,With such a weight upon his wings as now;
12294,ONE OF THE BAND,But they will soon be lightened.
12295,ONE OF THE BAND,
12296,ONE OF THE BAND,
12297,ONE OF THE BAND,"OSWALD                                         Ay, look up--"
12298,ONE OF THE BAND,"Cast round you your mind's eye, and you will learn"
12299,ONE OF THE BAND,Fortitude is the child of Enterprise:
12300,ONE OF THE BAND,"Great actions move our admiration, chiefly"
12301,ONE OF THE BAND,Because they carry in themselves an earnest
12302,ONE OF THE BAND,That we can suffer greatly.
12303,ONE OF THE BAND,
12304,ONE OF THE BAND,
12305,ONE OF THE BAND,MARMADUKE                                  Very true.
12306,ONE OF THE BAND,
12307,ONE OF THE BAND,
12308,ONE OF THE BAND,"OSWALD        Action is transitory--a step, a blow,"
12309,ONE OF THE BAND,The motion of a muscle--this way or that--
12310,ONE OF THE BAND,"'Tis done, and in the after-vacancy"
12311,ONE OF THE BAND,We wonder at ourselves like men betrayed:
12312,ONE OF THE BAND,"Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark,"
12313,ONE OF THE BAND,And shares the nature of infinity.
12314,ONE OF THE BAND,
12315,ONE OF THE BAND,
12316,ONE OF THE BAND,MARMADUKE     Truth--and I feel it.

12318,ONE OF THE BAND,
12319,ONE OF THE BAND,OSWALD                              What! if you had bid
12320,ONE OF THE BAND,Eternal farewell to unmingled joy
12321,ONE OF THE BAND,And the light dancing of the thoughtless heart;
12322,ONE OF THE BAND,"It is the toy of fools, and little fit"
12323,ONE OF THE BAND,For such a world as this. The wise abjure
12324,ONE OF THE BAND,All thoughts whose idle composition lives
12325,ONE OF THE BAND,In the entire forgetfulness of pain.
12326,ONE OF THE BAND,--I see I have disturbed you.

12329,ONE OF THE BAND,MARMADUKE                                   By no means.
12330,ONE OF THE BAND,
12331,ONE OF THE BAND,
12332,ONE OF THE BAND,OSWALD        Compassion!--pity!--pride can do without them;

12334,ONE OF THE BAND,"He is a puny soul who, feeling pain,"
12335,ONE OF THE BAND,Finds ease because another feels it too.
12336,ONE OF THE BAND,If e'er I open out this heart of mine
12337,ONE OF THE BAND,It shall be for a nobler end--to teach
12338,ONE OF THE BAND,And not to purchase puling sympathy.

12347,MARMADUKE,"It cannot live with thought; think on, think on,"
12348,MARMADUKE,"And it will die. What! in this universe,"
12349,MARMADUKE,"Where the least things control the greatest, where"
12350,MARMADUKE,The faintest breath that breathes can move a world;
12351,MARMADUKE,"What! feel remorse, where, if a cat had sneezed,"
12352,MARMADUKE,"A leaf had fallen, the thing had never been"
12353,MARMADUKE,Whose very shadow gnaws us to the vitals.
12354,MARMADUKE,
12355,MARMADUKE,
12356,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     Now, whither are you wandering? That a man"
12357,MARMADUKE,"So used to suit his language to the time,"
12358,MARMADUKE,Should thus so widely differ from himself--
12359,MARMADUKE,It is most strange.

12362,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                            Murder!--what's in the word!--
12363,MARMADUKE,I have no cases by me ready made
12364,MARMADUKE,To fit all deeds. Carry him to the Camp!--
12365,MARMADUKE,A shallow project;--you of late have seen
12366,MARMADUKE,"More deeply, taught us that the institutes"
12367,MARMADUKE,"Of Nature, by a cunning usurpation"
12368,MARMADUKE,"Banished from human intercourse, exist"
12369,MARMADUKE,Only in our relations to the brutes
12370,MARMADUKE,That make the fields their dwelling. If a snake
12371,MARMADUKE,Crawl from beneath our feet we do not ask
12372,MARMADUKE,A license to destroy him: our good governors
12373,MARMADUKE,Hedge in the life of every pest and plague
12374,MARMADUKE,"That bears the shape of man; and for what purpose,"
12375,MARMADUKE,But to protect themselves from extirpation?--
12376,MARMADUKE,This flimsy barrier you have overleaped.
12377,MARMADUKE,
12378,MARMADUKE,
12379,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     My Office is fulfilled--the Man is now

12539,ACT IV,ACT IV
12540,ACT IV,
12541,ACT IV,SCENE--A desolate prospect--a ridge of rocks--a Chapel on the summit of
12542,ACT IV,one--Moon behind the rocks--night stormy--irregular sound of a
12543,ACT IV,bell--HERBERT enters exhausted.
12544,ACT IV,
12545,ACT IV,
12546,ACT IV,"HERBERT       That Chapel-bell in mercy seemed to guide me,"
12547,ACT IV,But now it mocks my steps; its fitful stroke
12548,ACT IV,Can scarcely be the work of human hands.
12549,ACT IV,"Hear me, ye Men, upon the cliffs, if such"
12550,ACT IV,There be who pray nightly before the Altar.
12551,ACT IV,Oh that I had but strength to reach the place!
12552,ACT IV,My Child--my Child--dark--dark--I faint--this wind--
12553,ACT IV,These stifling blasts--God help me!
12554,ACT IV,
12555,ACT IV,
12556,ACT IV,[Enter ELDRED.]
12557,ACT IV,
12558,ACT IV,
12559,ACT IV,"ELDRED                                       Better this bare rock,"
12560,ACT IV,"Though it were tottering over a man's head,"
12561,ACT IV,Than a tight case of dungeon walls for shelter
12562,ACT IV,From such rough dealing.
12563,ACT IV,[A moaning voice is heard.]
12564,ACT IV,Ha! what sound is that?
12565,ACT IV,Trees creaking in the wind (but none are here)
12566,ACT IV,Send forth such noises--and that weary bell!
12567,ACT IV,Surely some evil Spirit abroad to-night
12568,ACT IV,"Is ringing it--'twould stop a Saint in prayer,"
12569,ACT IV,And that--what is it? never was sound so like
12570,ACT IV,A human groan. Ha! what is here? Poor Man--
12571,ACT IV,"Murdered! alas! speak--speak, I am your friend:"
12572,ACT IV,"No answer--hush--lost wretch, he lifts his hand"
12573,ACT IV,And lays it to his heart--
12574,ACT IV,(Kneels to him.)                   I pray you speak!
12575,ACT IV,What has befallen you?
12576,ACT IV,
12577,ACT IV,
12578,ACT IV,HERBERT (feebly)
12579,ACT IV,"A stranger has done this,"
12580,ACT IV,And in the arms of a stranger I must die.
12581,ACT IV,
12582,ACT IV,"ELDRED        Nay, think not so: come, let me raise you up:"
12583,ACT IV,[Raises him.]
12584,ACT IV,This is a dismal place--well--that is well--
12585,ACT IV,I was too fearful--take me for your guide
12586,ACT IV,And your support--my hut is not far off.
12587,ACT IV,[Draws him gently off the stage.]
12588,ACT IV,
12589,ACT IV,
12590,ACT IV,
12591,ACT IV,SCENE--A room in the Hostel--MARMADUKE and OSWALD
12592,ACT IV,
12593,ACT IV,
12594,ACT IV,MARMADUKE     But for Idonea!--I have cause to think
12595,ACT IV,That she is innocent.
12596,ACT IV,
12597,ACT IV,
12598,ACT IV,"OSWALD                            Leave that thought awhile,"
12599,ACT IV,As one of those beliefs which in their hearts
12600,ACT IV,"Lovers lock up as pearls, though oft no better"
12601,ACT IV,Than feathers clinging to their points of passion.
12602,ACT IV,This day's event has laid on me the duty
12603,ACT IV,"Of opening out my story; you must hear it,"
12604,ACT IV,"And without further preface.--In my youth,"
12605,ACT IV,Except for that abatement which is paid
12606,ACT IV,"By envy as a tribute to desert,"
12607,ACT IV,"I was the pleasure of all hearts, the darling"
12608,ACT IV,Of every tongue--as you are now. You've heard
12609,ACT IV,That I embarked for Syria. On our voyage
12610,ACT IV,Was hatched among the crew a foul Conspiracy
12611,ACT IV,"Against my honour, in the which our Captain"
12612,ACT IV,"Was, I believed, prime Agent. The wind fell;"
12613,ACT IV,"We lay becalmed week after week, until"
12614,ACT IV,The water of the vessel was exhausted;
12615,ACT IV,"I felt a double fever in my veins,"
12616,ACT IV,Yet rage suppressed itself;--to a deep stillness
12617,ACT IV,"Did my pride tame my pride;--for many days,"
12618,ACT IV,"On a dead sea under a burning sky,"
12619,ACT IV,"I brooded o'er my injuries, deserted"
12620,ACT IV,"By man and nature;--if a breeze had blown,"
12621,ACT IV,"It might have found its way into my heart,"
12622,ACT IV,And I had been--no matter--do you mark me?
12623,ACT IV,
12624,ACT IV,
12625,ACT IV,MARMADUKE     Quick--to the point--if any untold crime
12626,ACT IV,Doth haunt your memory.
12627,ACT IV,
12628,ACT IV,
12629,ACT IV,"OSWALD                                Patience, hear me further!--"
12630,ACT IV,One day in silence did we drift at noon
12631,ACT IV,"By a bare rock, narrow, and white, and bare;"
12632,ACT IV,"No food was there, no drink, no grass, no shade,"
12633,ACT IV,"No tree, nor jutting eminence, nor form"
12634,ACT IV,"Inanimate large as the body of man,"
12635,ACT IV,Nor any living thing whose lot of life
12636,ACT IV,Might stretch beyond the measure of one moon.
12637,ACT IV,"To dig for water on the spot, the Captain"
12638,ACT IV,"Landed with a small troop, myself being one:"
12639,ACT IV,There I reproached him with his treachery.
12640,ACT IV,"Imperious at all times, his temper rose;"
12641,ACT IV,"He struck me; and that instant had I killed him,"
12642,ACT IV,"And put an end to his insolence, but my Comrades"
12643,ACT IV,Rushed in between us: then did I insist
12644,ACT IV,"(All hated him, and I was stung to madness)"
12645,ACT IV,"That we should leave him there, alive!--we did so."
12646,ACT IV,
12647,ACT IV,
12648,ACT IV,MARMADUKE     And he was famished?
12649,ACT IV,
12650,ACT IV,
12651,ACT IV,OSWALD                              Naked was the spot;
12652,ACT IV,Methinks I see it now--how in the sun
12653,ACT IV,Its stony surface glittered like a shield;
12654,ACT IV,"And in that miserable place we left him,"
12655,ACT IV,Alone but for a swarm of minute creatures
12656,ACT IV,"Not one of which could help him while alive,"
12657,ACT IV,Or mourn him dead.
12658,ACT IV,
12659,ACT IV,
12660,ACT IV,"MARMADUKE                        A man by men cast off,"
12661,ACT IV,"Left without burial! nay, not dead nor dying,"
12662,ACT IV,"But standing, walking, stretching forth his arms,"
12663,ACT IV,"In all things like ourselves, but in the agony"
12664,ACT IV,With which he called for mercy; and--even so--
12665,ACT IV,He was forsaken?
12666,ACT IV,
12667,ACT IV,
12668,ACT IV,OSWALD                             There is a power in sounds:
12669,ACT IV,The cries he uttered might have stopped the boat
12670,ACT IV,That bore us through the water--
12671,ACT IV,
12672,ACT IV,
12673,ACT IV,MARMADUKE                                      You returned
12674,ACT IV,Upon that dismal hearing--did you not?
12675,ACT IV,
12676,ACT IV,
12677,ACT IV,"OSWALD        Some scoffed at him with hellish mockery,"
12678,ACT IV,And laughed so loud it seemed that the smooth sea
12679,ACT IV,Did from some distant region echo us.
12680,ACT IV,
12681,ACT IV,
12682,ACT IV,"MARMADUKE     We all are of one blood, our veins are filled"
12683,ACT IV,At the same poisonous fountain!
12684,ACT IV,
12685,ACT IV,
12686,ACT IV,OSWALD                                      'Twas an island
12687,ACT IV,"Only by sufferance of the winds and waves,"
12688,ACT IV,Which with their foam could cover it at will.
12689,ACT IV,"I know not how he perished; but the calm,"
12690,ACT IV,"The same dead calm, continued many days."
12691,ACT IV,
12692,ACT IV,
12693,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE
12694,MARMADUKE,"But his own crime had brought on him this doom,"
12695,MARMADUKE,His wickedness prepared it; these expedients
12696,MARMADUKE,"Are terrible, yet ours is not the fault."
12697,MARMADUKE,
12698,MARMADUKE,
12699,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD        The man was famished, and was innocent!"
12700,MARMADUKE,
12701,MARMADUKE,
12702,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE      Impossible!
12703,MARMADUKE,
12704,MARMADUKE,
12705,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                       The man had never wronged me.
12706,MARMADUKE,
12707,MARMADUKE,
12708,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     Banish the thought, crush it, and be at peace."
12709,MARMADUKE,His guilt was marked--these things could never be
12710,MARMADUKE,"Were there not eyes that see, and for good ends,"
12711,MARMADUKE,Where ours are baffled.
12712,MARMADUKE,
12713,MARMADUKE,
12714,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                                 I had been deceived.
12715,MARMADUKE,
12716,MARMADUKE,
12717,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     And from that hour the miserable man
12718,MARMADUKE,No more was heard of?
12719,MARMADUKE,
12720,MARMADUKE,
12721,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                              I had been betrayed.
12722,MARMADUKE,
12723,MARMADUKE,
12724,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     And he found no deliverance!
12725,MARMADUKE,
12726,MARMADUKE,
12727,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                                     The Crew
12728,MARMADUKE,Gave me a hearty welcome; they had laid
12729,MARMADUKE,"The plot to rid themselves, at any cost,"
12730,MARMADUKE,Of a tyrannic Master whom they loathed.
12731,MARMADUKE,"So we pursued our voyage: when we landed,"
12732,MARMADUKE,The tale was spread abroad; my power at once
12733,MARMADUKE,"Shrunk from me; plans and schemes, and lofty hopes--"
12734,MARMADUKE,All vanished. I gave way--do you attend?
12735,MARMADUKE,
12736,MARMADUKE,
12737,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     The Crew deceived you?
12738,MARMADUKE,
12739,MARMADUKE,
12740,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD                               Nay, command yourself."
12741,MARMADUKE,
12742,MARMADUKE,
12743,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     It is a dismal night--how the wind howls!
12744,MARMADUKE,
12745,MARMADUKE,
12746,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD        I hid my head within a Convent, there"
12747,MARMADUKE,Lay passive as a dormouse in mid winter.
12748,MARMADUKE,That was no life for me--I was o'erthrown
12749,MARMADUKE,But not destroyed.
12750,MARMADUKE,
12751,MARMADUKE,
12752,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     The proofs--you ought to have seen
12753,MARMADUKE,The guilt--have touched it--felt it at your heart--
12754,MARMADUKE,As I have done.
12755,MARMADUKE,
12756,MARMADUKE,
12757,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                          A fresh tide of Crusaders
12758,MARMADUKE,Drove by the place of my retreat: three nights
12759,MARMADUKE,Did constant meditation dry my blood;
12760,MARMADUKE,"Three sleepless nights I passed in sounding on,"
12761,MARMADUKE,"Through words and things, a dim and perilous way;"
12762,MARMADUKE,"And, wheresoe'er I turned me, I beheld"
12763,MARMADUKE,A slavery compared to which the dungeon
12764,MARMADUKE,And clanking chains are perfect liberty.
12765,MARMADUKE,You understand me--I was comforted;
12766,MARMADUKE,I saw that every possible shape of action
12767,MARMADUKE,Might lead to good--I saw it and burst forth
12768,MARMADUKE,Thirsting for some of those exploits that fill
12769,MARMADUKE,The earth for sure redemption of lost peace.
12770,MARMADUKE,[Marking MARMADUKE'S countenance.]
12771,MARMADUKE,"Nay, you have had the worst. Ferocity"
12772,MARMADUKE,"Subsided in a moment, like a wind"
12773,MARMADUKE,That drops down dead out of a sky it vexed.
12774,MARMADUKE,And yet I had within me evermore
12775,MARMADUKE,A salient spring of energy; I mounted
12776,MARMADUKE,From action up to action with a mind
12777,MARMADUKE,That never rested--without meat or drink
12778,MARMADUKE,Have I lived many days--my sleep was bound
12779,MARMADUKE,To purposes of reason--not a dream
12780,MARMADUKE,But had a continuity and substance
12781,MARMADUKE,That waking life had never power to give.
12782,MARMADUKE,
12783,MARMADUKE,
12784,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     O wretched Human-kind!--Until the mystery
12785,MARMADUKE,"Of all this world is solved, well may we envy"
12786,MARMADUKE,"The worm, that, underneath a stone whose weight"
12787,MARMADUKE,"Would crush the lion's paw with mortal anguish,"
12788,MARMADUKE,"Doth lodge, and feed, and coil, and sleep, in safety."
12789,MARMADUKE,Fell not the wrath of Heaven upon those traitors?
12790,MARMADUKE,
12791,MARMADUKE,
12792,MARMADUKE,OSWALD        Give not to them a thought. From Palestine
12793,MARMADUKE,"We marched to Syria: oft I left the Camp,"
12794,MARMADUKE,"When all that multitude of hearts was still,"
12795,MARMADUKE,"And followed on, through woods of gloomy cedar,"
12796,MARMADUKE,Into deep chasms troubled by roaring streams;
12797,MARMADUKE,Or from the top of Lebanon surveyed
12798,MARMADUKE,"The moonlight desert, and the moonlight sea:"
12799,MARMADUKE,In these my lonely wanderings I perceived
12800,MARMADUKE,What mighty objects do impress their forms
12801,MARMADUKE,To elevate our intellectual being;
12802,MARMADUKE,"And felt, if aught on earth deserves a curse,"
12803,MARMADUKE,'Tis that worst principle of ill which dooms
12804,MARMADUKE,A thing so great to perish self-consumed.
12805,MARMADUKE,--So much for my remorse!
12806,MARMADUKE,
12807,MARMADUKE,
12808,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                                Unhappy Man!
12809,MARMADUKE,
12810,MARMADUKE,
12811,MARMADUKE,OSWALD        When from these forms I turned to contemplate
12812,MARMADUKE,"The World's opinions and her usages,"
12813,MARMADUKE,I seemed a Being who had passed alone
12814,MARMADUKE,"Into a region of futurity,"
12815,MARMADUKE,Whose natural element was freedom--
12816,MARMADUKE,
12817,MARMADUKE,
12818,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE                                           Stop--
12819,MARMADUKE,"I may not, cannot, follow thee."
12820,MARMADUKE,
12821,MARMADUKE,
12822,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                                          You must.
12823,MARMADUKE,I had been nourished by the sickly food
12824,MARMADUKE,Of popular applause. I now perceived
12825,MARMADUKE,"That we are praised, only as men in us"
12826,MARMADUKE,"Do recognise some image of themselves,"
12827,MARMADUKE,"An abject counterpart of what they are,"
12828,MARMADUKE,Or the empty thing that they would wish to be.
12829,MARMADUKE,I felt that merit has no surer test
12830,MARMADUKE,"Than obloquy; that, if we wish to serve"
12831,MARMADUKE,"The world in substance, not deceive by show,"
12832,MARMADUKE,"We must become obnoxious to its hate,"
12833,MARMADUKE,Or fear disguised in simulated scorn.
12834,MARMADUKE,
12835,MARMADUKE,
12836,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     I pity, can forgive, you; but those wretches--"
12837,MARMADUKE,That monstrous perfidy!
12838,MARMADUKE,
12839,MARMADUKE,
12840,MARMADUKE,OSWALD                                 Keep down your wrath.
12841,MARMADUKE,"False Shame discarded, spurious Fame despised,"
12842,MARMADUKE,"Twin sisters both of Ignorance, I found"
12843,MARMADUKE,Life stretched before me smooth as some broad way
12844,MARMADUKE,Cleared for a monarch's progress. Priests might spin
12845,MARMADUKE,"Their veil, but not for me--'twas in fit place"
12846,MARMADUKE,"Among its kindred cobwebs. I had been,"
12847,MARMADUKE,"And in that dream had left my native land,"
12848,MARMADUKE,One of Love's simple bondsmen--the soft chain
12849,MARMADUKE,"Was off for ever; and the men, from whom"
12850,MARMADUKE,"This liberation came, you would destroy:"
12851,MARMADUKE,Join me in thanks for their blind services.
12852,MARMADUKE,
12853,MARMADUKE,
12854,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE     'Tis a strange aching that, when we would curse"
12855,MARMADUKE,And cannot.--You have betrayed me--I have done--
12856,MARMADUKE,I am content--I know that he is guiltless--
12857,MARMADUKE,"That both are guiltless, without spot or stain,"
12858,MARMADUKE,Mutually consecrated. Poor old Man!
12859,MARMADUKE,"And I had heart for this, because thou lovedst"
12860,MARMADUKE,Her who from very infancy had been
12861,MARMADUKE,"Light to thy path, warmth to thy blood!--Together"
12862,MARMADUKE,[Turning to OSWALD.]
12863,MARMADUKE,"We propped his steps, he leaned upon us both."
12864,MARMADUKE,
12865,MARMADUKE,
12866,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD        Ay, we are coupled by a chain of adamant;"
12867,MARMADUKE,"Let us be fellow-labourers, then, to enlarge"
12868,MARMADUKE,Man's intellectual empire. We subsist
12869,MARMADUKE,In slavery; all is slavery; we receive
12870,MARMADUKE,"Laws, but we ask not whence those laws have come;"
12871,MARMADUKE,We need an inward sting to goad us on.
12872,MARMADUKE,
12873,MARMADUKE,
12874,MARMADUKE,MARMADUKE     Have you betrayed me? Speak to that.
12875,MARMADUKE,
12876,MARMADUKE,
12877,MARMADUKE,"OSWALD                                             The mask,"
12878,MARMADUKE,"Which for a season I have stooped to wear,"
12879,MARMADUKE,"Must be cast off.--Know then that I was urged,"
12880,MARMADUKE,"(For other impulse let it pass) was driven,"
12881,MARMADUKE,"To seek for sympathy, because I saw"
12882,MARMADUKE,In you a mirror of my youthful self;
12883,MARMADUKE,"I would have made us equal once again,"
12884,MARMADUKE,"But that was a vain hope. You have struck home,"
12885,MARMADUKE,With a few drops of blood cut short the business;
12886,MARMADUKE,Therein for ever you must yield to me.
12887,MARMADUKE,But what is done will save you from the blank
12888,MARMADUKE,Of living without knowledge that you live:
12889,MARMADUKE,"Now you are suffering--for the future day,"
12890,MARMADUKE,'Tis his who will command it.--Think of my story--
12891,MARMADUKE,Herbert is _innocent_.
12892,MARMADUKE,
12893,MARMADUKE,
12894,MARMADUKE,"MARMADUKE (in a faint voice, and doubtingly)"
12895,MARMADUKE,You do but echo
12896,MARMADUKE,My own wild words?
12897,MARMADUKE,

13399,ELDRED.,And you remember such was my report:
13400,ELDRED.,From what has just befallen me I have cause
13401,ELDRED.,To fear the very worst.
13402,ELDRED.,
13403,ELDRED.,
13404,ELDRED.,IDONEA                                My Father is dead;

13406,ELDRED.,
13407,ELDRED.,
13408,ELDRED.,ELDRED        A wicked Man should answer for his crimes.
13409,ELDRED.,

13413,ELDRED.,
13414,ELDRED.,"ELDRED                                 It was most heinous,"

13417,ELDRED.,
13418,ELDRED.,"IDONEA                                        Do not add,"

13420,ELDRED.,
13421,ELDRED.,
13422,ELDRED.,ELDRED        Hereafter you will thank me for this service.
13423,ELDRED.,"Hard by, a Man I met, who, from plain proofs"
13424,ELDRED.,"Of interfering Heaven, I have no doubt,"
13425,ELDRED.,Laid hands upon your Father. Fit it were
13426,ELDRED.,You should prepare to meet him.
13427,ELDRED.,
13428,ELDRED.,
13429,ELDRED.,IDONEA                                       I have nothing
13430,ELDRED.,To do with others; help me to my Father--

13432,ELDRED.,"upon his neck, and after some time,]"
13433,ELDRED.,"In joy I met thee, but a few hours past;"

13460,ELDRED.,"His body is at rest: there was a plot,"
13461,ELDRED.,"A hideous plot, against the soul of man:"
13462,ELDRED.,"It took effect--and yet I baffled it,"
13463,ELDRED.,In _some_ degree.
13464,ELDRED.,
13465,ELDRED.,
13466,ELDRED.,"IDONEA                           Between us stood, I thought,"

13469,ELDRED.,Alone partake of it?--Beloved Marmaduke!
13470,ELDRED.,
13471,ELDRED.,
13472,ELDRED.,MARMADUKE     Give me a reason why the wisest thing
13473,ELDRED.,"That the earth owns shall never choose to die,"
13474,ELDRED.,But some one must be near to count his groans.
13475,ELDRED.,"The wounded deer retires to solitude,"
13476,ELDRED.,"And dies in solitude: all things but man,"
13477,ELDRED.,All die in solitude.
13478,ELDRED.,[Moving towards the cottage door.]
13479,ELDRED.,"Mysterious God,"
13480,ELDRED.,If she had never lived I had not done it!--
13481,ELDRED.,
13482,ELDRED.,
13483,ELDRED.,IDONEA        Alas! the thought of such a cruel death
13484,ELDRED.,Has overwhelmed him.--I must follow.

13487,ELDRED.,ELDRED                                            Lady!
13488,ELDRED.,You will do well; (she goes) unjust suspicion may
13489,ELDRED.,"Cleave to this Stranger: if, upon his entering,"
13490,ELDRED.,"The dead Man heave a groan, or from his side"
13491,ELDRED.,Uplift his hand--that would be evidence.
13492,ELDRED.,
13493,ELDRED.,
13494,ELDRED.,"ELEANOR       Shame! Eldred, shame!"
13495,ELDRED.,
13496,ELDRED.,
13497,ELDRED.,MARMADUKE (both returning)
13498,ELDRED.,The dead have but one face.

13501,ELDRED.,"Helpless and harmless as a babe: a Man,"
13502,ELDRED.,"By obvious signal to the world's protection,"
13503,ELDRED.,Solemnly dedicated--to decoy him!--

13505,ELDRED.,

13511,ELDRED.,"The thing most precious, that it now contains:"
13512,ELDRED.,Therefore through me alone must be revealed
13513,ELDRED.,"By whom thy Parent was destroyed, Idonea!"

13517,ELDRED.,IDONEA                               O miserable Father!
13518,ELDRED.,Thou didst command me to bless all mankind;
13519,ELDRED.,"Nor to this moment, have I ever wished"
13520,ELDRED.,"Evil to any living thing; but hear me,"
13521,ELDRED.,"Hear me, ye Heavens!--"
13522,ELDRED.,(kneeling)                 --may vengeance haunt the fiend
13523,ELDRED.,For this most cruel murder: let him live
13524,ELDRED.,And move in terror of the elements;
13525,ELDRED.,The thunder send him on his knees to prayer
13526,ELDRED.,"In the open streets, and let him think he sees,"
13527,ELDRED.,"If e'er he entereth the house of God,"
13528,ELDRED.,"The roof, self-moved, unsettling o'er his head;"
13529,ELDRED.,"And let him, when he would lie down at night,"
13530,ELDRED.,Point to his wife the blood-drops on his pillow!
13531,ELDRED.,
13532,ELDRED.,
13533,ELDRED.,"MARMADUKE     My voice was silent, but my heart hath joined thee."
13534,ELDRED.,
13535,ELDRED.,
13536,ELDRED.,IDONEA (leaning on MARMADUKE)
13537,ELDRED.,Left to the mercy of that savage Man!
13538,ELDRED.,How could he call upon his Child!--O Friend!
13539,ELDRED.,[Turns to MARMADUKE.]
13540,ELDRED.,My faithful true and only Comforter.
13541,ELDRED.,
13542,ELDRED.,
13543,ELDRED.,"MARMADUKE     Ay, come to me and weep. (He kisses her.)"
13544,ELDRED.,"(To ELDRED.) Yes, Varlet, look,"
13545,ELDRED.,The devils at such sights do clap their hands.
13546,ELDRED.,[ELDRED retires alarmed.]
13547,ELDRED.,
13548,ELDRED.,
13549,ELDRED.,"IDONEA        Thy vest is torn, thy cheek is deadly pale;"

13564,ELDRED.,

14132,WE ARE SEVEN,Composed 1798.--Published 1798.
14133,WE ARE SEVEN,
14134,WE ARE SEVEN,
14135,WE ARE SEVEN,"[Written at Alfoxden in the spring of 1798, under circumstances"
14136,WE ARE SEVEN,"somewhat remarkable. The little girl who is the heroine, I met within"
14137,WE ARE SEVEN,the area of Goodrich Castle in the year 1793. Having left the Isle of
14138,WE ARE SEVEN,"Wight, and crost Salisbury Plain, as mentioned in the preface to"
14139,WE ARE SEVEN,"'Guilt and Sorrow', I proceeded by Bristol up the Wye, and so on to N."
14140,WE ARE SEVEN,"Wales to the Vale of Clwydd, where I spent my summer under the roof of"
14141,WE ARE SEVEN,"the father of my friend, Robert Jones."
14142,WE ARE SEVEN,
14143,WE ARE SEVEN,"In reference to this poem, I will here mention one of the most"
14144,WE ARE SEVEN,"remarkable facts in my own poetic history, and that of Mr. Coleridge."
14145,WE ARE SEVEN,"In the spring of the year 1798, he, my sister, and myself, started"
14146,WE ARE SEVEN,"from Alfoxden pretty late in the afternoon, with a view to visit"
14147,WE ARE SEVEN,Linton and the Valley of Stones near it; and as our united funds were
14148,WE ARE SEVEN,"very small, we agreed to defray the expense of the tour by writing a"
14149,WE ARE SEVEN,"poem, to be sent to the 'New Monthly Magazine', set up by Philips, the"
14150,WE ARE SEVEN,"bookseller, and edited by Dr. Aikin. Accordingly we set off, and"
14151,WE ARE SEVEN,"proceeded along the Quantock Hills, towards Watchet; and in the course"
14152,WE ARE SEVEN,"of this walk was planned the poem of 'The Ancient Mariner', founded on"
14153,WE ARE SEVEN,"a dream, as Mr. Coleridge said, of his friend Mr. Cruikshank. Much the"
14154,WE ARE SEVEN,greatest part of the story was Mr. Coleridge's invention; but certain
14155,WE ARE SEVEN,"parts I myself suggested: for example, some crime was to be committed"
14156,WE ARE SEVEN,"which should bring upon the Old Navigator, as Coleridge afterwards"
14157,WE ARE SEVEN,"delighted to call him, the spectral persecution, as a consequence of"
14158,WE ARE SEVEN,"that crime, and his own wanderings. I had been reading in Shelvocke's"
14159,WE ARE SEVEN,"'Voyages', a day or two before, that, while doubling Cape Horn, they"
14160,WE ARE SEVEN,"frequently saw albatrosses in that latitude, the largest sort of"
14161,WE ARE SEVEN,"sea-fowl, some extending their wings twelve or thirteen feet."
14162,WE ARE SEVEN,"'Suppose,' said I, 'you represent him as having killed one of these"
14163,WE ARE SEVEN,"birds on entering the South Sea, and that the tutelary spirits of"
14164,WE ARE SEVEN,these regions take upon them to avenge the crime.' The incident was
14165,WE ARE SEVEN,"thought fit for the purpose, and adopted accordingly. I also suggested"
14166,WE ARE SEVEN,"the navigation of the ship by the dead men, but do not recollect that"
14167,WE ARE SEVEN,I had anything more to do with the scheme of the poem. The gloss with
14168,WE ARE SEVEN,which it was subsequently accompanied was not thought of by either of
14169,WE ARE SEVEN,"us at the time; at least not a hint of it was given to me, and I have"
14170,WE ARE SEVEN,no doubt it was a gratuitous after-thought. We began the composition
14171,WE ARE SEVEN,"together, on that to me memorable evening: I furnished two or three"
14172,WE ARE SEVEN,"lines at the beginning of the poem, in particular--"
14173,WE ARE SEVEN,
14174,WE ARE SEVEN,And listen'd like a three years' child;
14175,WE ARE SEVEN,The Mariner had his will.
14176,WE ARE SEVEN,
14177,WE ARE SEVEN,"These trifling contributions, all but one (which Mr. C. has with"
14178,WE ARE SEVEN,"unnecessary scrupulosity recorded), slipt out of his mind, as well"
14179,WE ARE SEVEN,they might. As we endeavoured to proceed conjointly (I speak of the
14180,WE ARE SEVEN,"same evening), our respective manners proved so widely different, that"
14181,WE ARE SEVEN,it would have been quite presumptuous in me to do anything but
14182,WE ARE SEVEN,separate from an undertaking upon which I could only have been a clog.
14183,WE ARE SEVEN,"We returned after a few days from a delightful tour, of which I have"
14184,WE ARE SEVEN,"many pleasant, and some of them droll enough, recollections. We"
14185,WE ARE SEVEN,returned by Dulverton to Alfoxden. 'The Ancient Mariner' grew and grew
14186,WE ARE SEVEN,"till it became too important for our first object, which was limited"
14187,WE ARE SEVEN,to our expectation of five pounds; and we began to talk of a volume
14188,WE ARE SEVEN,"which was to consist, as Mr. Coleridge has told the world, of Poems"
14189,WE ARE SEVEN,"chiefly on natural subjects taken from common life, but looked at, as"
14190,WE ARE SEVEN,"much as might be, through an imaginative medium. Accordingly I wrote"
14191,WE ARE SEVEN,"'The Idiot Boy', 'Her eyes are wild', etc., 'We are Seven', 'The"
14192,WE ARE SEVEN,"Thorn', and some others. To return to 'We are Seven', the piece that"
14193,WE ARE SEVEN,"called forth this note, I composed it while walking in the grove at"
14194,WE ARE SEVEN,"Alfoxden. My friends will not deem it too trifling to relate, that"
14195,WE ARE SEVEN,"while walking to and fro I composed the last stanza first, having"
14196,WE ARE SEVEN,"begun with the last line. When it was all but finished, I came in and"
14197,WE ARE SEVEN,"recited it to Mr. Coleridge and my sister, and said, ""A prefatory"
14198,WE ARE SEVEN,"stanza must be added, and I should sit down to our little tea-meal"
14199,WE ARE SEVEN,"with greater pleasure if my task was finished."" I mentioned in"
14200,WE ARE SEVEN,"substance what I wished to be expressed, and Coleridge immediately"
14201,WE ARE SEVEN,"threw off the stanza, thus;"
14202,WE ARE SEVEN,
14203,WE ARE SEVEN,"A little child, dear brother Jem,"
14204,WE ARE SEVEN,
14205,WE ARE SEVEN,"I objected to the rhyme, 'dear brother Jem,' as being ludicrous; but"
14206,WE ARE SEVEN,"we all enjoyed the joke of hitching in our friend James Tobin's name,"
14207,WE ARE SEVEN,who was familiarly called Jem. He was the brother of the dramatist;
14208,WE ARE SEVEN,and this reminds me of an anecdote which it may be worth while here to
14209,WE ARE SEVEN,"notice. The said Jem got a sight of the ""Lyrical Ballads"" as it was"
14210,WE ARE SEVEN,"going through the press at Bristol, during which time I was residing"
14211,WE ARE SEVEN,"in that city. One evening he came to me with a grave face, and said,"
14212,WE ARE SEVEN,"""Wordsworth, I have seen the volume that Coleridge and you are about"
14213,WE ARE SEVEN,to publish. There is one poem in it which I earnestly entreat you will
14214,WE ARE SEVEN,"cancel, for, if published, it will make you everlastingly ridiculous."""
14215,WE ARE SEVEN,"I answered, that I felt much obliged by the interest he took in my"
14216,WE ARE SEVEN,"good name as a writer, and begged to know what was the unfortunate"
14217,WE ARE SEVEN,"piece he alluded to. He said, 'It is called 'We are Seven'.' 'Nay,'"
14218,WE ARE SEVEN,"said I, 'that shall take its chance, however'; and he left me in"
14219,WE ARE SEVEN,"despair. I have only to add, that in the spring [A] of 1841, I"
14220,WE ARE SEVEN,"revisited Goodrich Castle, not having seen that part of the Wye since"
14221,WE ARE SEVEN,I met the little girl there in 1793. It would have given me greater
14222,WE ARE SEVEN,pleasure to have found in the neighbouring hamlet traces of one who
14223,WE ARE SEVEN,"had interested me so much, but that was impossible, as unfortunately I"
14224,WE ARE SEVEN,"did not even know her name. The ruin, from its position and features,"
14225,WE ARE SEVEN,is a most impressive object. I could not but deeply regret that its
14226,WE ARE SEVEN,solemnity was impaired by a fantastic new Castle set up on a
14227,WE ARE SEVEN,"projection of the same ridge, as if to show how far modern art can go"
14228,WE ARE SEVEN,in surpassing all that could be done by antiquity and nature with
14229,WE ARE SEVEN,"their united graces, remembrances, and associations. I could have"
14230,WE ARE SEVEN,"almost wished for power, so much the contrast vexed me, to blow away"

14804,THE THORN,
14805,THE THORN,
14806,THE THORN,"In the editions of 1800-1805, Wordsworth added the following note to"
14807,THE THORN,this poem:
14808,THE THORN,
14809,THE THORN,"""This Poem ought to have been preceded by an introductory Poem, which"
14810,THE THORN,I have been prevented from writing by never having felt myself in a
14811,THE THORN,mood when it was probable that I should write it well.--The character
14812,THE THORN,which I have here introduced speaking is sufficiently common. The
14813,THE THORN,"Reader will perhaps have a general notion of it, if he has ever known"
14814,THE THORN,"a man, a Captain of a small trading vessel for example, who being past"
14815,THE THORN,"the middle age of life, had retired upon an annuity or small"
14816,THE THORN,independent income to some village or country town of which he was not
14817,THE THORN,"a native, or in which he had not been accustomed to live. Such men"
14818,THE THORN,having little to do become credulous and talkative from indolence; and
14819,THE THORN,"from the same cause, and other predisposing causes by which it is"
14820,THE THORN,"probable that such men may have been affected, they are prone to"
14821,THE THORN,superstition. On which account it appeared to me proper to select a
14822,THE THORN,character like this to exhibit some of the general laws by which
14823,THE THORN,superstition acts upon the mind. Superstitious men are almost always
14824,THE THORN,men of slow faculties and deep feelings; their minds are not loose but
14825,THE THORN,"adhesive; they have a reasonable share of imagination, by which word I"
14826,THE THORN,mean the faculty which produces impressive effects out of simple
14827,THE THORN,"elements; but they are utterly destitute of fancy, the power by which"
14828,THE THORN,pleasure and surprise are excited by sudden varieties of situation and
14829,THE THORN,by accumulated imagery.
14830,THE THORN,
14831,THE THORN,"""It was my wish in this poem to shew the manner in which such men"
14832,THE THORN,"cleave to the same ideas; and to follow the turns of passion, always"
14833,THE THORN,"different, yet not palpably different, by which their conversation is"
14834,THE THORN,"swayed. I had two objects to attain; first, to represent a picture"
14835,THE THORN,which should not be unimpressive yet consistent with the character
14836,THE THORN,"that should describe it, secondly, while I adhered to the style in"
14837,THE THORN,"which such persons describe, to take care that words, which in their"
14838,THE THORN,"minds are impregnated with passion, should likewise convey passion to"
14839,THE THORN,Readers who are not accustomed to sympathize with men feeling in that
14840,THE THORN,manner or using such language. It seemed to me that this might be done
14841,THE THORN,by calling in the assistance of Lyrical and rapid Metre. It was
14842,THE THORN,"necessary that the Poem, to be natural, should in reality move slowly;"
14843,THE THORN,"yet I hoped, that, by the aid of the metre, to those who should at all"
14844,THE THORN,"enter into the spirit of the Poem, it would appear to move quickly."
14845,THE THORN,The Reader will have the kindness to excuse this note as I am sensible
14846,THE THORN,that an introductory Poem is necessary to give this Poem its full
14847,THE THORN,effect.
14848,THE THORN,
14849,THE THORN,"""Upon this occasion I will request permission to add a few words"
14850,THE THORN,closely connected with 'The Thorn' and many other Poems in these
14851,THE THORN,Volumes. There is a numerous class of readers who imagine that the
14852,THE THORN,same words cannot be repeated without tautology; this is a great
14853,THE THORN,error: virtual tautology is much oftener produced by using different
14854,THE THORN,"words when the meaning is exactly the same. Words, a Poet's words more"
14855,THE THORN,"particularly, ought to be weighed in the balance of feeling and not"
14856,THE THORN,measured by the space which they occupy upon paper. For the Reader
14857,THE THORN,cannot be too often reminded that Poetry is passion: it is the history
14858,THE THORN,or science of feelings: now every man must know that an attempt is
14859,THE THORN,rarely made to communicate impassioned feelings without something of
14860,THE THORN,"an accompanying consciousness of the inadequateness of our own powers,"
14861,THE THORN,or the deficiencies of language. During such efforts there will be a
14862,THE THORN,"craving in the mind, and as long as it is unsatisfied the Speaker will"
14863,THE THORN,"cling to the same words, or words of the same character. There are"
14864,THE THORN,also various other reasons why repetition and apparent tautology are
14865,THE THORN,frequently beauties of the highest kind. Among the chief of these
14866,THE THORN,"reasons is the interest which the mind attaches to words, not only as"
14867,THE THORN,"symbols of the passion, but as 'things', active and efficient, which"
14868,THE THORN,"are of themselves part of the passion. And further, from a spirit of"
14869,THE THORN,"fondness, exultation, and gratitude, the mind luxuriates in the"
14870,THE THORN,repetition of words which appear successfully to communicate its
14871,THE THORN,feelings. The truth of these remarks might be shown by innumerable
14872,THE THORN,passages from the Bible and from the impassioned poetry of every
14873,THE THORN,nation.
14874,THE THORN,
14875,THE THORN,"Awake, awake, Deborah! awake, awake, utter a song: Arise Barak, and"
14876,THE THORN,"lead captivity captive, thou Son of Abinoam."
14877,THE THORN,
14878,THE THORN,"At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed, he"
14879,THE THORN,fell: where he bowed there he fell down dead.

14887,THE THORN,
14888,THE THORN,"""The poem of 'The Thorn', as the reader will soon discover, is not"
14889,THE THORN,supposed to be spoken in the author's own person: the character of the
14890,THE THORN,loquacious narrator will sufficiently shew itself in the course of the

14908,THE THORN,"done, but it reminds one too much of Wilson. The only fault, however,"
14909,THE THORN,"of any consequence is the female figure, which is too old and decrepit"

15686,THE POEM,And to the fields his road would take;                        70
15687,THE POEM,"And there, at night, in frost and snow,"
15688,THE POEM,He watched to seize old Goody Blake.
15689,THE POEM,
15690,THE POEM,"And once, behind a rick of barley,"
15691,THE POEM,Thus looking out did Harry stand:
15692,THE POEM,"The moon was full and shining clearly,                        75"
15693,THE POEM,And crisp with frost the stubble land.
15694,THE POEM,--He hears a noise--he's all awake--
15695,THE POEM,Again?--on tip-toe down the hill
15696,THE POEM,He softly creeps--'tis Goody Blake;
15697,THE POEM,She's at the hedge of Harry Gill!                             80
15698,THE POEM,
15699,THE POEM,Right glad was he when he beheld her:
15700,THE POEM,Stick after stick did Goody pull:
15701,THE POEM,"He stood behind a bush of elder,"
15702,THE POEM,Till she had filled her apron full.
15703,THE POEM,"When with her load she turned about,                          85"
15704,THE POEM,The by-way [6] back again to take;
15705,THE POEM,"He started forward, with a shout,"
15706,THE POEM,And sprang upon poor Goody Blake.
15707,THE POEM,
15708,THE POEM,"And fiercely by the arm he took her,"
15709,THE POEM,"And by the arm he held her fast,                              90"
15710,THE POEM,"And fiercely by the arm he shook her,"
15711,THE POEM,"And cried, ""I've caught you then at last!"""
15712,THE POEM,"Then Goody, who had nothing said,"
15713,THE POEM,Her bundle from her lap let fall;
15714,THE POEM,"And, kneeling on the sticks, she prayed                       95"
15715,THE POEM,To God that is the judge of all.
15716,THE POEM,
15717,THE POEM,"She prayed, her withered hand uprearing,"
15718,THE POEM,While Harry held her by the arm--
15719,THE POEM,"""God! who art never out of hearing,"
15720,THE POEM,"O may he never more be warm!""                                100"
15721,THE POEM,"The cold, cold moon above her head,"
15722,THE POEM,Thus on her knees did Goody pray;
15723,THE POEM,Young Harry heard what she had said:
15724,THE POEM,And icy cold he turned away.
15725,THE POEM,
15726,THE POEM,He went complaining all the morrow                           105
15727,THE POEM,That he was cold and very chill:
15728,THE POEM,"His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow,"
15729,THE POEM,Alas! that day for Harry Gill!
15730,THE POEM,"That day he wore a riding-coat,"
15731,THE POEM,But not a whit the warmer he:                                110
15732,THE POEM,"Another was on Thursday brought,"
15733,THE POEM,And ere the Sabbath he had three.
15734,THE POEM,
15735,THE POEM,"'Twas all in vain, a useless matter,"
15736,THE POEM,And blankets were about him pinned;
15737,THE POEM,"Yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter,                   115"
15738,THE POEM,Like a loose casement in the wind.
15739,THE POEM,And Harry's flesh it fell away;

16547,TO MY SISTER,[Composed in front of Alfoxden House. My little boy-messenger on this
16548,TO MY SISTER,occasion was the son of Basil Montagu. The larch mentioned in the
16549,TO MY SISTER,"first stanza was standing when I revisited the place in May 1841, more"
16550,TO MY SISTER,than forty years after. I was disappointed that it had not improved in
16551,TO MY SISTER,"appearance as to size, nor had it acquired anything of the majesty of"
16552,TO MY SISTER,"age, which, even though less perhaps than any other tree, the larch"
16553,TO MY SISTER,"sometimes does. A few score yards from this tree, grew, when we"
16554,TO MY SISTER,"inhabited Alfoxden, one of the most remarkable beech-trees ever seen."
16555,TO MY SISTER,"The ground sloped both towards and from it. It was of immense size,"
16556,TO MY SISTER,"and threw out arms that struck into the soil, like those of the"
16557,TO MY SISTER,"banyan-tree, and rose again from it. Two of the branches thus inserted"
16558,TO MY SISTER,"themselves twice, which gave to each the appearance of a serpent"
16559,TO MY SISTER,moving along by gathering itself up in folds. One of the large boughs
16560,TO MY SISTER,"of this tree had been torn off by the wind before we left Alfoxden,"
16561,TO MY SISTER,but five remained. In 1841 we could barely find the spot where the
16562,TO MY SISTER,tree had stood. So remarkable a production of nature could not have
16563,TO MY SISTER,been wilfully destroyed.--I. F.]

16567,TO MY SISTER,"person to whom they are addressed'. From 1820 to 1843 the title was, 'To"
16568,TO MY SISTER,"my Sister; written at a small distance from my House, and sent by my"
16569,TO MY SISTER,"little Boy'. In 1845 and afterwards, it was simply 'To my Sister'. The"

17473,THE POEM,"And Johnny makes the noise he loves,                          100"
17474,THE POEM,"And Betty listens, glad to hear it."
17475,THE POEM,
17476,THE POEM,Away she hies to Susan Gale:
17477,THE POEM,Her Messenger's in merry tune; [9]
17478,THE POEM,"The owlets hoot, the owlets curr,"
17479,THE POEM,"And Johnny's lips they burr, burr, burr,                      105"
17480,THE POEM,As [10] on he goes beneath the moon.
17481,THE POEM,
17482,THE POEM,His steed and he right well agree;
17483,THE POEM,"For of this Pony there's a rumour,"
17484,THE POEM,"That, should he lose his eyes and ears,"
17485,THE POEM,"And should he live a thousand years,                          110"
17486,THE POEM,He never will be out of humour.
17487,THE POEM,
17488,THE POEM,But then he is a horse that thinks!
17489,THE POEM,"And when he thinks, his pace is slack;"
17490,THE POEM,"Now, though he knows poor Johnny well,"
17491,THE POEM,"Yet, for his life, he cannot tell                             115"
17492,THE POEM,What he has got upon his back.
17493,THE POEM,
17494,THE POEM,"So through the moonlight lanes they go,"
17495,THE POEM,"And far into the moonlight dale,"
17496,THE POEM,"And by the church, and o'er the down,"
17497,THE POEM,"To bring a Doctor from the town,                              120"
17498,THE POEM,To comfort poor old Susan Gale.
17499,THE POEM,
17500,THE POEM,"And Betty, now at Susan's side,"
17501,THE POEM,"Is in the middle of her story,"
17502,THE POEM,"What speedy help her Boy will bring, [11]"
17503,THE POEM,"With many a most diverting thing,                             125"
17504,THE POEM,"Of Johnny's wit, and Johnny's glory."
17505,THE POEM,
17506,THE POEM,"And Betty, still at Susan's side,"
17507,THE POEM,By this time is not quite so flurried: [12]
17508,THE POEM,Demure with porringer and plate
17509,THE POEM,"She sits, as if in Susan's fate                               130"
17510,THE POEM,Her life and soul were buried.
17511,THE POEM,
17512,THE POEM,"But Betty, poor good woman! she,"
17513,THE POEM,"You plainly in her face may read it,"
17514,THE POEM,Could lend out of that moment's store
17515,THE POEM,Five years of happiness or more                               135
17516,THE POEM,To any that might need it.
17517,THE POEM,
17518,THE POEM,But yet I guess that now and then
17519,THE POEM,With Betty all was not so well;
17520,THE POEM,"And to the road she turns her ears,"
17521,THE POEM,"And thence full many a sound she hears,                       140"
17522,THE POEM,Which she to Susan will not tell.
17523,THE POEM,
17524,THE POEM,"Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans;"
17525,THE POEM,"""As sure as there's a moon in heaven,"""
17526,THE POEM,"Cries Betty, ""he'll be back again;"
17527,THE POEM,They'll both be here--'tis almost ten--                      145
17528,THE POEM,"Both will be [13] here before eleven."""
17529,THE POEM,
17530,THE POEM,"Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans;"
17531,THE POEM,The clock gives warning for eleven;
17532,THE POEM,"'Tis on the stroke--""He must be near,"""
17533,THE POEM,"Quoth Betty, ""and will soon be here, [14]                     150"
17534,THE POEM,"As sure as there's a moon in heaven."""
17535,THE POEM,
17536,THE POEM,"The clock is on the stroke of twelve,"
17537,THE POEM,And Johnny is not yet in sight:
17538,THE POEM,"--The Moon's in heaven, as Betty sees,"
17539,THE POEM,But Betty is not quite at ease;                               155
17540,THE POEM,And Susan has a dreadful night.
17541,THE POEM,
17542,THE POEM,"And Betty, half an hour ago,"
17543,THE POEM,On Johnny vile reflections cast:
17544,THE POEM,"""A little idle sauntering Thing!"""
17545,THE POEM,"With other names, an endless string;                          160"
17546,THE POEM,But now that time is gone and past.
17547,THE POEM,
17548,THE POEM,"And Betty's drooping at the heart,"
17549,THE POEM,"That happy time all past and gone,"
17550,THE POEM,"""How can it be he is so late?"
17551,THE POEM,"The Doctor, he has made him wait;                             165"
17552,THE POEM,"Susan! they'll both be here anon."""
17553,THE POEM,
17554,THE POEM,"And Susan's growing worse and worse,"
17555,THE POEM,And Betty's in a sad _quandary_;
17556,THE POEM,And then there's nobody to say
17557,THE POEM,"If she must go, or she must stay!                             170"
17558,THE POEM,--She's in a sad _quandary_.
17559,THE POEM,
17560,THE POEM,The clock is on the stroke of one;
17561,THE POEM,But neither Doctor nor his Guide
17562,THE POEM,Appears [15] along the moonlight road;
17563,THE POEM,"There's neither horse nor man abroad,                         175"
17564,THE POEM,And Betty's still at Susan's side.
17565,THE POEM,
17566,THE POEM,And Susan now begins to fear [16]
17567,THE POEM,"Of sad mischances not a few,"
17568,THE POEM,That Johnny may perhaps be drowned;
17569,THE POEM,"Or lost, perhaps, and never found;                            180"
17570,THE POEM,Which they must both for ever rue.
17571,THE POEM,
17572,THE POEM,She prefaced half a hint of this
17573,THE POEM,"With, ""God forbid it should be true!"""
17574,THE POEM,At the first word that Susan said
17575,THE POEM,"Cried Betty, rising from the bed,                             185"
17576,THE POEM,"""Susan, I'd gladly stay with you."
17577,THE POEM,
17578,THE POEM,"""I must be gone, I must away:"
17579,THE POEM,"Consider, Johnny's but half-wise;"
17580,THE POEM,"Susan, we must take care of him,"
17581,THE POEM,"If he is hurt in life or limb""--                             190"
17582,THE POEM,"""Oh God forbid!"" poor Susan cries."
17583,THE POEM,
17584,THE POEM,"""What can I do?"" says Betty, going,"
17585,THE POEM,"""What can I do to ease your pain?"
17586,THE POEM,"Good Susan tell me, and I'll stay;"
17587,THE POEM,"I fear you're in a dreadful way,                              195"
17588,THE POEM,"But I shall soon be back again."""
17589,THE POEM,
17590,THE POEM,"""Nay, Betty, [17] go! good Betty, go!"
17591,THE POEM,"There's nothing that can ease my pain."""
17592,THE POEM,Then off she hies; but with a prayer
17593,THE POEM,"That God poor Susan's life would spare,                       200"
17594,THE POEM,Till she comes back again.
17595,THE POEM,
17596,THE POEM,"So, through the moonlight lane she goes,"
17597,THE POEM,And far into the moonlight dale;
17598,THE POEM,"And how she ran, and how she walked,"
17599,THE POEM,"And all that to herself she talked,                           205"
17600,THE POEM,Would surely be a tedious tale.
17601,THE POEM,
17602,THE POEM,"In high and low, above, below,"
17603,THE POEM,"In great and small, in round and square,"
17604,THE POEM,"In tree and tower was Johnny seen,"
17605,THE POEM,"In bush and brake, in black and green;                        210"
17606,THE POEM,"'Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where."
17607,THE POEM,
17608,THE POEM,"And while she crossed the bridge, there came"
17609,THE POEM,A thought with which her heart is sore--[18]
17610,THE POEM,"Johnny perhaps his horse forsook,"
17611,THE POEM,"To hunt the moon within the brook, [19]                       215"
17612,THE POEM,And never will be heard of more.
17613,THE POEM,
17614,THE POEM,"Now is she high [20] upon the down,"
17615,THE POEM,Alone amid a prospect wide;
17616,THE POEM,There's neither Johnny nor his Horse
17617,THE POEM,Among the fern or in the gorse;                               220
17618,THE POEM,There's neither Doctor nor his Guide.
17619,THE POEM,
17620,THE POEM,"""Oh saints! what is become of him?"
17621,THE POEM,"Perhaps he's climbed into an oak,"
17622,THE POEM,Where he will stay till he is dead;
17623,THE POEM,"Or, sadly he has been misled,                                 225"
17624,THE POEM,And joined the wandering gipsy-folk.
17625,THE POEM,
17626,THE POEM,"""Or him that wicked Pony's carried"
17627,THE POEM,"To the dark cave, the goblin's hall;"
17628,THE POEM,Or in the castle he's pursuing
17629,THE POEM,Among the ghosts his own undoing;                             230
17630,THE POEM,"Or playing with the waterfall."""
17631,THE POEM,
17632,THE POEM,"At poor old Susan then she railed,"
17633,THE POEM,While to the town she posts away;
17634,THE POEM,"""If Susan had not been so ill,"
17635,THE POEM,"Alas! I should have had him still,                            235"
17636,THE POEM,"My Johnny, till my dying day."""
17637,THE POEM,
17638,THE POEM,"Poor Betty, in this sad distemper,"
17639,THE POEM,The Doctor's self could [21] hardly spare:
17640,THE POEM,"Unworthy things she talked, and wild;"
17641,THE POEM,"Even he, of cattle the most mild,                             240"
17642,THE POEM,The Pony had his share.
17643,THE POEM,
17644,THE POEM,"But now she's fairly in the town, [22]"
17645,THE POEM,And to the Doctor's door she hies;
17646,THE POEM,'Tis silence all on every side;
17647,THE POEM,"The town so long, the town so wide,                           245"
17648,THE POEM,Is silent as the skies.
17649,THE POEM,
17650,THE POEM,"And now she's at the Doctor's door,"
17651,THE POEM,"She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap;"
17652,THE POEM,The Doctor at the casement shows
17653,THE POEM,His glimmering eyes that peep and doze!                       250
17654,THE POEM,And one hand rubs his old night-cap.
17655,THE POEM,
17656,THE POEM,"""Oh Doctor! Doctor! where's my Johnny?"""
17657,THE POEM,"""I'm here, what is't you want with me?"""
17658,THE POEM,"""Oh Sir! you know I'm Betty Foy,"
17659,THE POEM,"And I have lost my poor dear Boy,                             255"
17660,THE POEM,You know him--him you often see;
17661,THE POEM,
17662,THE POEM,"""He's not so wise as some folks be"":"
17663,THE POEM,"""The devil take his wisdom!"" said"
17664,THE POEM,"The Doctor, looking somewhat grim,"
17665,THE POEM,"""What, Woman! should I know of him?""                          260"
17666,THE POEM,"And, grumbling, he went back to bed!"
17667,THE POEM,
17668,THE POEM,"""O woe is me! O woe is me!"
17669,THE POEM,Here will I die; here will I die;
17670,THE POEM,"I thought to find my lost one here, [23]"
17671,THE POEM,"But he is neither far nor near,                               265"
17672,THE POEM,"Oh! what a wretched Mother I!"""
17673,THE POEM,
17674,THE POEM,"She stops, she stands, she looks about;"
17675,THE POEM,Which way to turn she cannot tell.
17676,THE POEM,Poor Betty! it would ease her pain
17677,THE POEM,If she had heart to knock again;                              270
17678,THE POEM,--The clock strikes three--a dismal knell!
17679,THE POEM,
17680,THE POEM,"Then up along the town she hies,"
17681,THE POEM,No wonder if her senses fail;
17682,THE POEM,"This piteous news so much it shocked her,"
17683,THE POEM,"She quite forgot to send the Doctor,                          275"
17684,THE POEM,To comfort poor old Susan Gale.
17685,THE POEM,
17686,THE POEM,"And now she's high upon the down,"
17687,THE POEM,And she can see a mile of road:
17688,THE POEM,"""O cruel! I'm almost threescore;"
17689,THE POEM,"Such night as this was ne'er before,                          280"
17690,THE POEM,"There's not a single soul abroad."""
17691,THE POEM,
17692,THE POEM,"She listens, but she cannot hear"
17693,THE POEM,"The foot of horse, the voice of man;"
17694,THE POEM,"The streams with softest sound are flowing,"
17695,THE POEM,"The grass you almost hear it growing,                         285"
17696,THE POEM,"You hear it now, if e'er you can."
17697,THE POEM,
17698,THE POEM,The owlets through the long blue night
17699,THE POEM,Are shouting to each other still:
17700,THE POEM,"Fond lovers! yet not quite hob nob,"
17701,THE POEM,"They lengthen out the tremulous sob,                          290"
17702,THE POEM,That echoes far from hill to hill.
17703,THE POEM,
17704,THE POEM,"Poor Betty now has lost all hope,"
17705,THE POEM,"Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin,"
17706,THE POEM,"A green-grown pond she just has past,"
17707,THE POEM,"And from the brink she hurries fast,                          295"
17708,THE POEM,Lest she should drown herself therein.
17709,THE POEM,
17710,THE POEM,And now she sits her down and weeps;
17711,THE POEM,Such tears she never shed before;
17712,THE POEM,"""Oh dear, dear Pony! my sweet joy!"
17713,THE POEM,Oh carry back my Idiot Boy!                                   300
17714,THE POEM,"And we will ne'er o'erload thee more."""
17715,THE POEM,
17716,THE POEM,A thought is come into her head:
17717,THE POEM,"The Pony he is mild and good,"
17718,THE POEM,And we have always used him well;
17719,THE POEM,"Perhaps he's gone along the dell,                             305"
17720,THE POEM,And carried Johnny to the wood.
17721,THE POEM,
17722,THE POEM,Then up she springs as if on wings;
17723,THE POEM,She thinks no more of deadly sin;
17724,THE POEM,"If Betty fifty ponds should see,"
17725,THE POEM,The last of all her thoughts would be                         310
17726,THE POEM,To drown herself therein.
17727,THE POEM,
17728,THE POEM,O Reader! now that I might tell
17729,THE POEM,What Johnny and his Horse are doing!
17730,THE POEM,"What they've been doing all this time,"
17731,THE POEM,"Oh could I put it into rhyme,                                 315"
17732,THE POEM,A most delightful tale pursuing!
17733,THE POEM,
17734,THE POEM,"Perhaps, and no unlikely thought!"
17735,THE POEM,He with his Pony now doth roam
17736,THE POEM,"The cliffs and peaks so high that are,"
17737,THE POEM,"To lay his hands upon a star,                                 320"
17738,THE POEM,And in his pocket bring it home.
17739,THE POEM,
17740,THE POEM,"Perhaps he's turned himself about,"
17741,THE POEM,"His face unto his horse's tail,"
17742,THE POEM,"And, still and mute, in wonder lost,"
17743,THE POEM,"All silent as a horseman-ghost,                               325"
17744,THE POEM,He travels slowly down the vale. [24]
17745,THE POEM,
17746,THE POEM,"And now, perhaps, is hunting [25] sheep,"
17747,THE POEM,A fierce and dreadful hunter he;
17748,THE POEM,"Yon valley, now so trim [26] and green,"
17749,THE POEM,"In five months' time, should he be seen,                      330"
17750,THE POEM,A desert wilderness will be!
17751,THE POEM,
17752,THE POEM,"Perhaps, with head and heels on fire,"
17753,THE POEM,"And like the very soul of evil,"
17754,THE POEM,"He's galloping away, away,"
17755,THE POEM,"And so will gallop [27] on for aye,                           335"
17756,THE POEM,The bane of all that dread the devil!
17757,THE POEM,
17758,THE POEM,I to the Muses have been bound
17759,THE POEM,"These fourteen years, by strong indentures: [A]"
17760,THE POEM,O gentle Muses! let me tell
17761,THE POEM,But half of what to him befel;                                340
17762,THE POEM,He surely met [28] with strange adventures.
17763,THE POEM,
17764,THE POEM,O gentle Muses! is this kind?
17765,THE POEM,Why will ye thus my suit repel?
17766,THE POEM,Why of your further aid bereave me?
17767,THE POEM,And can ye thus unfriended [29] leave me;                     345
17768,THE POEM,Ye Muses! whom I love so well?
17769,THE POEM,
17770,THE POEM,"Who's yon, that, near the waterfall,"
17771,THE POEM,Which thunders down with headlong force
17772,THE POEM,"Beneath the moon, yet shining fair,"
17773,THE POEM,"As careless as if nothing were,                               350"
17774,THE POEM,Sits upright on a feeding horse?
17775,THE POEM,
17776,THE POEM,"Unto his horse--there feeding [30] free,"
17777,THE POEM,"He seems, I think, the rein to give;"
17778,THE POEM,Of moon or stars he takes no heed;
17779,THE POEM,Of such we in romances read:                                  355
17780,THE POEM,--'Tis Johnny! Johnny! as I live.
17781,THE POEM,
17782,THE POEM,"And that's the very Pony, too!"
17783,THE POEM,"Where is she, where is Betty Foy?"
17784,THE POEM,She hardly can sustain her fears;
17785,THE POEM,"The roaring waterfall she hears,                              360"
17786,THE POEM,And cannot find her Idiot Boy.
17787,THE POEM,
17788,THE POEM,Your Pony's worth his weight in gold:
17789,THE POEM,"Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy!"
17790,THE POEM,"She's coming from among the trees,"
17791,THE POEM,And now all full in view she sees                             365
17792,THE POEM,"Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy."
17793,THE POEM,
17794,THE POEM,And Betty sees the Pony too:
17795,THE POEM,"Why stand you thus, good Betty Foy?"
17796,THE POEM,"It is no goblin, 'tis no ghost,"
17797,THE POEM,"'Tis he whom you so long have lost,                           370"
17798,THE POEM,"He whom you love, your Idiot Boy."
17799,THE POEM,
17800,THE POEM,She looks again--her arms are up--
17801,THE POEM,She screams--she cannot move for joy;
17802,THE POEM,"She darts, as with a torrent's force,"
17803,THE POEM,"She almost has o'erturned the Horse,                          375"
17804,THE POEM,And fast she holds her Idiot Boy.
17805,THE POEM,
17806,THE POEM,"And Johnny burrs, and laughs aloud;"
17807,THE POEM,Whether in cunning or in joy
17808,THE POEM,"I cannot tell; but while he laughs,"
17809,THE POEM,Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs                               380
17810,THE POEM,To hear again her Idiot Boy.
17811,THE POEM,
17812,THE POEM,"And now she's at the Pony's tail,"
17813,THE POEM,"And now is [31] at the Pony's head,--"
17814,THE POEM,"On that side now, and now on this;"
17815,THE POEM,"And, almost stifled with her bliss,                           385"
17816,THE POEM,A few sad tears does Betty shed.
17817,THE POEM,
17818,THE POEM,She kisses o'er and o'er again
17819,THE POEM,"Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy;"
17820,THE POEM,"She's happy here, is happy there, [32]"
17821,THE POEM,She is uneasy every where;                                    390
17822,THE POEM,Her limbs are all alive with joy.
17823,THE POEM,
17824,THE POEM,"She pats the Pony, where or when"
17825,THE POEM,"She knows not, happy Betty Foy!"
17826,THE POEM,"The little Pony glad may be,"
17827,THE POEM,"But he is milder far than she,                                395"
17828,THE POEM,You hardly can perceive his joy.
17829,THE POEM,
17830,THE POEM,"""Oh! Johnny, never mind the Doctor;"
17831,THE POEM,"You've done your best, and that is all:"""
17832,THE POEM,"She took the reins, when this was said,"
17833,THE POEM,And gently turned the Pony's head                             400
17834,THE POEM,From the loud waterfall.
17835,THE POEM,
17836,THE POEM,"By this the stars were almost gone,"
17837,THE POEM,"The moon was setting on the hill,"
17838,THE POEM,So pale you scarcely looked at her:
17839,THE POEM,"The little birds began to stir,                               405"
17840,THE POEM,Though yet their tongues were still.
17841,THE POEM,
17842,THE POEM,"The Pony, Betty, and her Boy,"
17843,THE POEM,Wind slowly through the woody dale;
17844,THE POEM,"And who is she, betimes abroad,"
17845,THE POEM,That hobbles up the steep rough road?                         410
17846,THE POEM,"Who is it, but old Susan Gale?"
17847,THE POEM,
17848,THE POEM,Long time lay Susan lost in thought; [33]
17849,THE POEM,"And many dreadful fears beset her,"
17850,THE POEM,Both for her Messenger and Nurse;
17851,THE POEM,"And, as her mind grew worse and worse,                        415"
17852,THE POEM,Her body--it grew better.
17853,THE POEM,
17854,THE POEM,"She turned, she tossed herself in bed,"
17855,THE POEM,On all sides doubts and terrors met her;
17856,THE POEM,Point after point did she discuss;
17857,THE POEM,"And, while her mind was fighting thus,                        420"
17858,THE POEM,Her body still grew better.
17859,THE POEM,
17860,THE POEM,"""Alas! what is become of them?"
17861,THE POEM,These fears can never be endured;
17862,THE POEM,"I'll to the wood.""--The word scarce said,"
17863,THE POEM,"Did Susan rise up from her bed,                               425"
17864,THE POEM,As if by magic cured.
17865,THE POEM,
17866,THE POEM,"Away she goes [34] up hill and down,"
17867,THE POEM,And to the wood at length is come;
17868,THE POEM,"She spies her Friends, she shouts a greeting;"
17869,THE POEM,Oh me! it is a merry meeting                                  430
17870,THE POEM,As ever was in Christendom.
17871,THE POEM,
17872,THE POEM,"The owls have hardly sung their last,"
17873,THE POEM,While our four travellers homeward wend;
17874,THE POEM,"The owls have hooted all night long,"
17875,THE POEM,"And with the owls began my song,                              435"
17876,THE POEM,And with the owls must end.
17877,THE POEM,
17878,THE POEM,"For while they all were travelling home,"
17879,THE POEM,"Cried Betty, ""Tell us, Johnny, do,"
17880,THE POEM,"Where all this long night you have been,"
17881,THE POEM,"What you have heard, what you have seen:                      440"
17882,THE POEM,"And, Johnny, mind you tell us true."""
17883,THE POEM,
17884,THE POEM,Now Johnny all night long had heard
17885,THE POEM,The owls in tuneful concert strive;
17886,THE POEM,No doubt too he the moon had seen;
17887,THE POEM,For in the moonlight he had been                              445
17888,THE POEM,From eight o'clock till five.
17889,THE POEM,
17890,THE POEM,"And thus, to Betty's question, he"
17891,THE POEM,"Made answer, like a traveller bold,"
17892,THE POEM,"(His very words I give to you,)"
17893,THE POEM,"""The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo,                         450"
17894,THE POEM,"And the sun did shine so cold!"""
17895,THE POEM,"--Thus answered Johnny in his glory,"
17896,THE POEM,And that was all his travel's story.

18218,THE POEM,I saw an aged Beggar in my walk;
18219,THE POEM,"And he was seated, by the highway side,"
18220,THE POEM,On a low structure of rude masonry
18221,THE POEM,"Built at the foot of a huge hill, that they"
18222,THE POEM,Who lead their horses down the steep rough road                  5
18223,THE POEM,May thence remount at ease. The aged Man
18224,THE POEM,Had placed his staff across the broad smooth stone
18225,THE POEM,"That overlays the pile; and, from a bag"
18226,THE POEM,"All white with flour, the dole of village dames,"
18227,THE POEM,"He drew his scraps and fragments, one by one;                   10"
18228,THE POEM,And scanned them with a fixed and serious look
18229,THE POEM,"Of idle computation. In the sun,"
18230,THE POEM,"Upon the second step of that small pile,"
18231,THE POEM,"Surrounded by those wild unpeopled hills,"
18232,THE POEM,"He sat, and ate [1] his food in solitude:                       15"
18233,THE POEM,"And ever, scattered from his palsied hand,"
18234,THE POEM,"That, still attempting to prevent the waste,"
18235,THE POEM,"Was baffled still, the crumbs in little showers"
18236,THE POEM,"Fell on the ground; and the small mountain birds,"
18237,THE POEM,"Not venturing yet to peck their destined meal,                  20"
18238,THE POEM,Approached within the length of half his staff.
18239,THE POEM,
18240,THE POEM,Him from my childhood have I known; and then
18241,THE POEM,"He was so old, he seems not older now;"
18242,THE POEM,"He travels on, a solitary Man,"
18243,THE POEM,"So helpless in appearance, that for him                         25"
18244,THE POEM,The sauntering Horseman throws not with a slack
18245,THE POEM,"And careless hand [2] his alms upon the ground,"
18246,THE POEM,"But stops,--that he may safely lodge the coin"
18247,THE POEM,"Within the old Man's hat; nor quits him so,"
18248,THE POEM,"But still, when he has given his horse the rein,                30"
18249,THE POEM,Watches the aged Beggar with a look [3]
18250,THE POEM,"Sidelong, and half-reverted. She who tends"
18251,THE POEM,"The toll-gate, when in summer at her door"
18252,THE POEM,"She turns her wheel, if on the road she sees"
18253,THE POEM,"The aged beggar coming, quits her work,                         35"
18254,THE POEM,And lifts the latch for him that he may pass.
18255,THE POEM,"The post-boy, when his rattling wheels o'ertake"
18256,THE POEM,"The aged Beggar in the woody lane,"
18257,THE POEM,"Shouts to him from behind; and, if thus warned [4]"
18258,THE POEM,"The old man does not change his course, the boy                 40"
18259,THE POEM,"Turns with less noisy wheels to the roadside,"
18260,THE POEM,"And passes gently by, without a curse"
18261,THE POEM,"Upon his lips, or anger at his heart."
18262,THE POEM,
18263,THE POEM,"He travels on, a solitary Man;"
18264,THE POEM,His age has no companion. On the ground                         45
18265,THE POEM,"His eyes are turned, and, as he moves along,"
18266,THE POEM,"_They_ move along the ground; and, evermore,"
18267,THE POEM,Instead of common and habitual sight
18268,THE POEM,"Of fields with rural works, of hill and dale,"
18269,THE POEM,"And the blue sky, one little span of earth                      50"
18270,THE POEM,"Is all his prospect. Thus, from day to day,"
18271,THE POEM,"Bow-bent, his eyes for ever on the ground, [5]"
18272,THE POEM,"He plies his weary journey; seeing still,"
18273,THE POEM,"And seldom [6] knowing that he sees, some straw,"
18274,THE POEM,"Some scattered leaf, or marks which, in one track,              55"
18275,THE POEM,The nails of cart or chariot-wheel have left
18276,THE POEM,"Impressed on the white road,--in the same line,"
18277,THE POEM,At distance still the same. Poor Traveller!
18278,THE POEM,His staff trails with him; scarcely do his feet [7]
18279,THE POEM,Disturb the summer dust; he is so still                         60
18280,THE POEM,"In look and motion, that the cottage curs, [8]"
18281,THE POEM,"Ere he has [9] passed the door, will turn away,"
18282,THE POEM,"Weary of barking at him. Boys and girls,"
18283,THE POEM,"The vacant and the busy, maids and youths,"
18284,THE POEM,And urchins newly breeched--all pass him by:                    65
18285,THE POEM,Him even the slow-paced waggon leaves behind.
18286,THE POEM,
18287,THE POEM,But deem not this Man useless.--Statesmen! ye
18288,THE POEM,"Who are so restless in your wisdom, ye"
18289,THE POEM,Who have a broom still ready in your hands
18290,THE POEM,"To rid the world of nuisances; ye proud,                        70"
18291,THE POEM,"Heart-swoln, while in your pride ye contemplate"
18292,THE POEM,"Your talents, power, or [10] wisdom, deem him not"
18293,THE POEM,A burthen of the earth! 'Tis nature's law
18294,THE POEM,"That none, the meanest of created things,"
18295,THE POEM,"Of forms created the most vile and brute,                       75"
18296,THE POEM,"The dullest or most noxious, should exist"
18297,THE POEM,"Divorced from good--a spirit and pulse of good,"
18298,THE POEM,"A life and soul, to every mode of being"
18299,THE POEM,Inseparably linked. Then be assured
18300,THE POEM,That least of all can aught--that ever owned                    80
18301,THE POEM,The heaven-regarding eye and front sublime [C]
18302,THE POEM,"Which man is born to--sink, howe'er depressed,"
18303,THE POEM,So low as to be scorned without a sin;
18304,THE POEM,Without offence to God cast out of view;
18305,THE POEM,Like the dry remnant of a garden-flower                         85
18306,THE POEM,"Whose seeds are shed, or as an implement"
18307,THE POEM,Worn out and worthless. [11] While from door to door
18308,THE POEM,"This old Man creeps, [12] the villagers in him"
18309,THE POEM,Behold a record which together binds
18310,THE POEM,"Past deeds and offices of charity,                              90"
18311,THE POEM,"Else unremembered, and so keeps alive"
18312,THE POEM,"The kindly mood in hearts which lapse of years,"
18313,THE POEM,"And that half-wisdom half-experience gives,"
18314,THE POEM,"Make slow to feel, and by sure steps resign"
18315,THE POEM,To selfishness and cold oblivious cares.                        95
18316,THE POEM,"Among the farms and solitary huts,"
18317,THE POEM,"Hamlets and thinly-scattered villages,"
18318,THE POEM,"Where'er the aged Beggar takes his rounds,"
18319,THE POEM,The mild necessity of use compels
18320,THE POEM,To acts of love; and habit does the work                       100
18321,THE POEM,Of reason; yet prepares that after-joy
18322,THE POEM,"Which reason cherishes. And thus the soul,"
18323,THE POEM,By that sweet taste of pleasure unpursued
18324,THE POEM,Doth find herself [13] insensibly disposed
18325,THE POEM,To virtue and true goodness.                                   105
18326,THE POEM,"Some there are,"
18327,THE POEM,"By their good works exalted, lofty minds"
18328,THE POEM,"And meditative, authors of delight"
18329,THE POEM,"And happiness, which to the end of time"
18330,THE POEM,"Will live, and spread, and kindle: even such minds [14]        110"
18331,THE POEM,"In childhood, from this solitary Being,"
18332,THE POEM,"Or from like wanderer, haply have received [15]"
18333,THE POEM,(A thing more precious far than all that books
18334,THE POEM,Or the solicitudes of love can do!)
18335,THE POEM,"That first mild touch of sympathy and thought,                 115"
18336,THE POEM,In which they found their kindred with a world
18337,THE POEM,Where want and sorrow were. The easy man
18338,THE POEM,"Who sits at his own door,--and, like the pear"
18339,THE POEM,"That [16] overhangs his head from the green wall,"
18340,THE POEM,"Feeds in the sunshine; the robust and young,                   120"
18341,THE POEM,"The prosperous and unthinking, they who live"
18342,THE POEM,"Sheltered, and flourish in a little grove"
18343,THE POEM,Of their own kindred;--all behold in him
18344,THE POEM,"A silent monitor, which on their minds"
18345,THE POEM,Must needs impress a transitory thought                        125
18346,THE POEM,"Of self-congratulation, to the heart"
18347,THE POEM,"Of each recalling his peculiar boons,"
18348,THE POEM,"His charters and exemptions; and, perchance,"
18349,THE POEM,Though he to no one give the fortitude
18350,THE POEM,And circumspection needful to preserve                         130
18351,THE POEM,"His present blessings, and to husband up"
18352,THE POEM,"The respite of the season, he, at least,"
18353,THE POEM,"And 'tis no vulgar service, makes them felt."
18354,THE POEM,
18355,THE POEM,"Yet further.--Many, I believe, there are"
18356,THE POEM,"Who live a life of virtuous decency,                           135"
18357,THE POEM,Men who can hear the Decalogue and feel
18358,THE POEM,No self-reproach; who of the moral law
18359,THE POEM,Established in the land where they abide
18360,THE POEM,Are strict observers; and not negligent
18361,THE POEM,"In acts of love to those with whom they dwell, [17]            140"
18362,THE POEM,"Their kindred, and the children of their blood."
18363,THE POEM,"Praise be to such, and to their slumbers peace!"
18364,THE POEM,"--But of the poor man ask, the abject poor;"
18365,THE POEM,"Go, and demand of him, if there be here"
18366,THE POEM,"In this cold abstinence from evil deeds,                       145"
18367,THE POEM,"And these inevitable charities,"
18368,THE POEM,Wherewith to satisfy the human soul?
18369,THE POEM,No--man is dear to man; the poorest poor
18370,THE POEM,Long for some moments in a weary life
18371,THE POEM,"When they can know and feel that they have been,               150"
18372,THE POEM,"Themselves, the fathers and the dealers-out"
18373,THE POEM,Of some small blessings; have been kind to such
18374,THE POEM,"As needed kindness, for this single cause,"
18375,THE POEM,That we have all of us one human heart.
18376,THE POEM,"--Such pleasure is to one kind Being known,                    155"
18377,THE POEM,"My neighbour, when with punctual care, each week"
18378,THE POEM,"Duly as Friday comes, though pressed herself"
18379,THE POEM,"By her own wants, she from her store [18] of meal"
18380,THE POEM,Takes one unsparing handful for the scrip
18381,THE POEM,"Of this old Mendicant, and, from her door                      160"
18382,THE POEM,"Returning with exhilarated heart,"
18383,THE POEM,"Sits by her fire, and builds her hope in heaven."
18384,THE POEM,
18385,THE POEM,"Then let him pass, a blessing on his head!"
18386,THE POEM,And while in that vast solitude to which
18387,THE POEM,"The tide of things has borne [19] him, he appears              165"
18388,THE POEM,"To breathe and live but for himself alone,"
18389,THE POEM,"Unblamed, uninjured, let him bear about"
18390,THE POEM,The good which the benignant law of Heaven
18391,THE POEM,"Has hung around him: and, while life is his,"
18392,THE POEM,Still let him prompt the unlettered villagers                  170
18393,THE POEM,To tender offices and pensive thoughts. [D]
18394,THE POEM,"--Then let him pass, a blessing on his head!"
18395,THE POEM,"And, long as he can wander, let him breathe"
18396,THE POEM,The freshness of the valleys; let his blood
18397,THE POEM,Struggle with frosty air and winter snows;                     175
18398,THE POEM,And let the chartered wind that sweeps the heath
18399,THE POEM,Beat his grey locks against his withered face.
18400,THE POEM,Reverence the hope whose vital anxiousness
18401,THE POEM,Gives the last human interest to his heart.
18402,THE POEM,"May never HOUSE, misnamed of INDUSTRY,                         180"
18403,THE POEM,"Make him a captive!--for that pent-up din,"
18404,THE POEM,"Those life-consuming sounds that clog the air,"
18405,THE POEM,Be his the natural silence of old age!
18406,THE POEM,Let him be free of mountain solitudes;
18407,THE POEM,"And have around him, whether heard or not,                     185"
18408,THE POEM,The pleasant melody of woodland birds.
18409,THE POEM,Few are his pleasures: if his eyes have now
18410,THE POEM,Been doomed so long to settle upon earth
18411,THE POEM,That not without some effort they behold
18412,THE POEM,"The countenance of the horizontal sun, [20]                    190"
18413,THE POEM,"Rising or setting, let the light at least"
18414,THE POEM,Find a free entrance to their languid orbs.
18415,THE POEM,"And let him, _where_ and _when_ he will, sit down"
18416,THE POEM,"Beneath the trees, or on a [21] grassy bank"
18417,THE POEM,"Of highway side, and with the little birds                     195"
18418,THE POEM,"Share his chance-gathered meal; and, finally,"
18419,THE POEM,"As in the eye of Nature he has lived,"
18420,THE POEM,So in the eye of Nature let him die! [E]
