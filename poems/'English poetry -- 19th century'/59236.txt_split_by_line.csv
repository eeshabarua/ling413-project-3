161,MEMOIR.,
162,MEMOIR.,
163,MEMOIR.,"Richard Harris Barham, the ""Thomas Ingoldsby"" of literature, was born"
164,MEMOIR.,"at Canterbury, December 6th, 1788. His family had long been residents"
165,MEMOIR.,"in the archiepiscopal city, and had estates in Kent. He (Barham) used"
166,MEMOIR.,to trace his descent from a knight who came over to England with
167,MEMOIR.,"William the Conqueror, and whose son, Reginald Fitzurse, was one of the"
168,MEMOIR.,"assassins of Thomas à Becket. After the deed Fitzurse fled to Ireland,"
169,MEMOIR.,"and there changed his name to MacMahon, which has the same meaning."
170,MEMOIR.,"His brother Robert, who succeeded to the English estates, changed his"
171,MEMOIR.,"patronymic to de Berham, converted in process of time into Barham."
172,MEMOIR.,
173,MEMOIR.,Richard Barham was only between five and six years old when his father
174,MEMOIR.,"died, leaving him heir to a small estate in Kent. A portion of it"
175,MEMOIR.,"consisted of a manor called Tappington Wood, often alluded to in the"
176,MEMOIR.,_Ingoldsby Legends_.
177,MEMOIR.,
178,MEMOIR.,"Richard was sent to St. Paul's School, and it was on his road thither,"
179,MEMOIR.,"in 1802, that he met with an accident that endangered his life. The"
180,MEMOIR.,"horses of the Dover mail, in which he was travelling, took fright and"
181,MEMOIR.,galloped off furiously: the boy put his right hand out of the window
182,MEMOIR.,"to open the door, when at that moment the coach upset; his hand was"
183,MEMOIR.,"caught under it, and it was dragged along on a rough road and seriously"
184,MEMOIR.,"mutilated. The surgeons, believing he would die, did not amputate the"
185,MEMOIR.,limb; and through the tender care of the headmaster's wife (he had been
186,MEMOIR.,sent on to school) he recovered.
187,MEMOIR.,
188,MEMOIR.,At school Barham formed some friendships which lasted his life: one
189,MEMOIR.,"of these school friends was afterwards his publisher, Mr. Bentley;"
190,MEMOIR.,"Dr. Roberts, who attended him in his last illness, was another. He"
191,MEMOIR.,"remained captain of St. Paul's School for two years, and when nineteen"
192,MEMOIR.,was entered as a Gentleman Commoner at Brasennose College. Here he was
193,MEMOIR.,"speedily elected a member of a first-class university club,--the Phœnix"
194,MEMOIR.,"Common Room,--where he became acquainted with Lord George Grenville,"
195,MEMOIR.,"Cecil Tattersall, and Theodore Hook, a friend of his after-life."
196,MEMOIR.,
197,MEMOIR.,A specimen of his youthful humour has been preserved in an answer he
198,MEMOIR.,"made to his tutor, Mr. Hodson, when reproved by him for the late hours"
199,MEMOIR.,"he kept and his absence from chapel. ""The fact is, sir,"" said Barham,"
200,MEMOIR.,"""you are too late for me."" ""Too late!"" repeated the tutor. ""Yes, sir; I"
201,MEMOIR.,cannot sit up till seven in the morning. I am a man of regular habits;
202,MEMOIR.,"and unless I get to bed by four or five at latest, I am really fit for"
203,MEMOIR.,"nothing the next day."" The habit that he had acquired of sitting up"
204,MEMOIR.,"late continued during his life, and he believed that he wrote best at"
205,MEMOIR.,night.
206,MEMOIR.,
207,MEMOIR.,"His original intention had been to study for the Bar, but a very severe"
208,MEMOIR.,"though short illness brought serious thoughts to the young man, and he"
209,MEMOIR.,"determined to enter the Church, his mind having also been painfully"
210,MEMOIR.,impressed by the suicide of a young college friend; consequently he
211,MEMOIR.,"took Holy Orders, and obtained the curacy of Ashford, in Kent, from"
212,MEMOIR.,"whence he was transferred to Westwell, a parish a few miles distant"
213,MEMOIR.,from his first one.
214,MEMOIR.,
215,MEMOIR.,"In 1814, when he had attained the age of twenty-six, Barham married"
216,MEMOIR.,"Caroline, third daughter of Captain Smart of the Royal Engineers, a"
217,MEMOIR.,very charming young lady; and shortly afterwards he was presented to
218,MEMOIR.,"the living of Snargate, and accepted also the curacy of Warehorn. Both"
219,MEMOIR.,"these parishes were situated in Romney Marsh, at the distance of only"
220,MEMOIR.,two miles from each other. The young clergyman took up his abode at
221,MEMOIR.,"Warehorn, a place then noted as a haunt of smugglers."
222,MEMOIR.,
223,MEMOIR.,"A second accident, by the upsetting of a gig, caused Mr. Barham a"
224,MEMOIR.,"fracture of the leg, and it was during the seclusion entailed by this"
225,MEMOIR.,"misfortune that he produced his first literary effort, a novel called"
226,MEMOIR.,"_Baldwin_, for which he received £20; it issued from the Minerva Press,"
227,MEMOIR.,and was unsuccessful. He had scarcely recovered from this accident
228,MEMOIR.,"when the illness of one of his children took him to London, for the"
229,MEMOIR.,"purpose of consulting Abernethy. Here he chanced to meet a friend,"
230,MEMOIR.,who was about to post a letter to invite a young clergyman to come up
231,MEMOIR.,and become a candidate for a vacant Minor Canonry at St. Paul's. It
232,MEMOIR.,"suddenly struck him that the place might suit Mr. Barham, and they at"
233,MEMOIR.,once agreed that he should stand for it. He resigned at once his curacy
234,MEMOIR.,"and living, stood for the Canonship, and was elected. Thus in 1821 he"
235,MEMOIR.,"exchanged Romney Marsh, its dulness and smugglers, for a residence in"
236,MEMOIR.,London and the society of a highly intellectual circle.
237,MEMOIR.,
238,MEMOIR.,"We will give here the testimony of a dear friend of the poet's, as"
239,MEMOIR.,"to his character, at this time. ""My first acquaintance with Mr."
240,MEMOIR.,"Barham,"" writes the Rev. John Hughes, ""dated from his election into"
241,MEMOIR.,"the body of Minor Canons of St. Paul's, of which Cathedral my late"
242,MEMOIR.,"father was then a Residentiary. Mr. Barham had married early in life,"
243,MEMOIR.,and in every respect enviably. His previous career as a graduate of
244,MEMOIR.,Brasennose College had thrown him much into contact with several
245,MEMOIR.,"gifted and accomplished men, upon whom a shred of Reginald Heber's"
246,MEMOIR.,"mantle, and a smack and savour of the 'Whippiad,' had descended in the"
247,MEMOIR.,"way of corporate inheritance, and his quick talents had mended the"
248,MEMOIR.,"lesson. It was soon evident to the Dean and Chapter, and to my father"
249,MEMOIR.,"in particular, that their new subordinate combined superior powers of"
250,MEMOIR.,conversation with most decorous and gentlemanly tact and attention to
251,MEMOIR.,"all points connected with his duties."""
252,MEMOIR.,
253,MEMOIR.,"In 1824, Mr. Barham was appointed a priest in ordinary of the King's"
254,MEMOIR.,"Chapel Royal, and was shortly afterwards presented with the incumbency"
255,MEMOIR.,of St. Mary Magdalene and St. Gregory-by-St. Paul. Mr. Barham was not
256,MEMOIR.,"an eloquent preacher, because he disapproved of all oratorical display"
257,MEMOIR.,"in the pulpit, but he was an excellent parish priest, ever watchful"
258,MEMOIR.,"over his flock, and delighting in doing good."
259,MEMOIR.,
260,MEMOIR.,In 1825 a series of domestic sorrows fell on the Minor Canon. His
261,MEMOIR.,dearly-loved eldest daughter died; her loss was followed at intervals
262,MEMOIR.,"by that of four of his other children, to all of whom he was devotedly"
263,MEMOIR.,attached. How deeply the gentle-hearted clergyman felt these severe
264,MEMOIR.,"afflictions, some touching lines in _Blackwood's Magazine_ of that date"
265,MEMOIR.,"testify, though he bore them with Christian resignation. ""The best"
266,MEMOIR.,substitute for stoicism which a man of keen and sensitive feelings
267,MEMOIR.,"finds it possible to adopt, is to think a little less of his own"
268,MEMOIR.,"sorrows, and more of those of others; and this,"" writes Mr. Hughes, ""I"
269,MEMOIR.,believe to have been Barham's secret for bearing with equanimity the
270,MEMOIR.,loss of more than one
271,MEMOIR.,
272,MEMOIR.,Who ne'er gave him pain till they died.
273,MEMOIR.,
274,MEMOIR.,"He strove to be happy in making others so, especially those more"
275,MEMOIR.,congenial spirits who more directly shared in his affections .... Here
276,MEMOIR.,it may not be amiss to notice one trait of character connected with
277,MEMOIR.,the appointment which he held as chaplain to the Vintners' Company.
278,MEMOIR.,Part of his duty in this capacity was to perform divine service at
279,MEMOIR.,"an almshouse in the vicinity of town, tenanted by certain widows of"
280,MEMOIR.,"decayed members of the corporation. The old ladies quarrelled sadly,"
281,MEMOIR.,and Barham was in the habit of devoting one extra morning a week to a
282,MEMOIR.,"pastoral visitation of these poor isolated old women, for charity and"
283,MEMOIR.,"decency's sake, and acted as arbiter and referee in their ridiculous"
284,MEMOIR.,"feuds, with as much gravity as it was in his nature to assume on such"
285,MEMOIR.,"an occasion."" There was surely no small degree of self-denial in a man"
286,MEMOIR.,of such talent devoting his valuable time to such an office.
287,MEMOIR.,
288,MEMOIR.,The expenses of an increasing family made Mr. Barham once more attempt
289,MEMOIR.,literary work--this time successfully; and he contributed light
290,MEMOIR.,"articles in rapid succession to _Blackwood_, _John Bull_, and _The"
291,MEMOIR.,Globe_. He also assisted in the completion of _Gorton's Biographical
292,MEMOIR.,"Dictionary_. ""Cousin Nicholas"" appeared in _Blackwood_ in 1878. It owed"
293,MEMOIR.,"its publication to Mrs. Hughes, the mother of John Hughes, Esq.,--from"
294,MEMOIR.,"whose account of Barham we have just quoted,--a most remarkable and"
295,MEMOIR.,"highly-gifted woman, the friend and correspondent of Scott, Southey,"
296,MEMOIR.,"etc. The MS. was in an unfinished state, having been laid by for some"
297,MEMOIR.,"years, when Barham submitted it to this lady. So highly did she think"
298,MEMOIR.,"of it, and so aware was she of the author's sensitive doubts, that she"
299,MEMOIR.,"sent it off at once to Mr. Blackwood, who was greatly pleased with"
300,MEMOIR.,"it, and at once inserted it in his magazine. The first Barham knew of"
301,MEMOIR.,the fate of his MSS. was the appearance of the introductory chapters
302,MEMOIR.,"in _Blackwood_. He was thus compelled to finish it, and worked up the"
303,MEMOIR.,catastrophe with great skill. Nor was this the only benefit he derived
304,MEMOIR.,from this gifted friend. It was to her he was indebted for much of the
305,MEMOIR.,"material of the poems that have made his fame as a writer, though this"
306,MEMOIR.,was to come afterwards.
307,MEMOIR.,
308,MEMOIR.,"In 1831, Sidney Smith was appointed one of the Canons of St. Paul's,"
309,MEMOIR.,"and thus two of our famous wits became intimate. On October 2, 1831,"
310,MEMOIR.,Sidney Smith read himself in as Residentiary at St. Paul's. He told
311,MEMOIR.,"Barham that he had once nearly offended Sam Rogers by recommending him,"
312,MEMOIR.,"when he sat for his picture, to be drawn saying his prayers--_with his"
313,MEMOIR.,face in his hat_.
314,MEMOIR.,
315,MEMOIR.,"Mr. Barham was by no means an ardent politician, and he never used"
316,MEMOIR.,"his pastoral influence on either side. For himself, he was a staunch"
317,MEMOIR.,"Conservative, and never failed, in spite of any personal inconvenience,"
318,MEMOIR.,himself to record his vote. He told one amusing anecdote about an
319,MEMOIR.,"election. As he was landing from the steamer at Gravesend, where his"
320,MEMOIR.,"vote was to be taken, it was raining heavily, and the passengers"
321,MEMOIR.,landing from the boat naturally put up their umbrellas. Partisans of
322,MEMOIR.,"both candidates lined the pier, watching eagerly to see what colours"
323,MEMOIR.,"the arrivals wore. Barham, remembering a dead cat that had been thrown"
324,MEMOIR.,"at him on a previous occasion, wore none; nevertheless he was detected."
325,MEMOIR.,"He heard the Tory partisans cry out, ""Here comes one on our side."""
326,MEMOIR.,"""You be blowed,"" said a voter in sky-blue ribbons, ""I say he's our'n."""
327,MEMOIR.,"""Be blowed yourself,"" was the reply; ""don't you see the gemman's got a"
328,MEMOIR.,"_silk umbrella_?"""
329,MEMOIR.,
330,MEMOIR.,"In 1837 appeared the famous ""Ingoldsby Legends"" in _Blackwood_."
331,MEMOIR.,
332,MEMOIR.,"Of their production Mr. Hughes thus writes: ""In my mother's"
333,MEMOIR.,"presentation copy of the _Ingoldsby Legends_, written in Barham's own"
334,MEMOIR.,"hand, occurs the following distich,--"
335,MEMOIR.,
336,MEMOIR.,"To Mrs. Hughes, who made me do 'em,"
337,MEMOIR.,Quod placeo est--si placeo--tuum.
338,MEMOIR.,
339,MEMOIR.,"The fact is that my mother, to whom Lockhart has alluded as a frequent"
340,MEMOIR.,"correspondent of Scott and Southey, and who inherited a family stock of"
341,MEMOIR.,"strange tales and legends, suggested the subject of 'Hamilton Tighe'"
342,MEMOIR.,"to Barham. The original ghost story, in the circumstances of which he"
343,MEMOIR.,"made some slight alteration, was said to have occurred in the family"
344,MEMOIR.,"of Mr. Pye, the poet laureate, a neighbour and brother magistrate of"
345,MEMOIR.,"my maternal grandfather, Mr. W., and the date of it was supposed to"
346,MEMOIR.,"be connected with the taking of Vigo. This legend, which appeared in"
347,MEMOIR.,"_Bentley's Miscellany_, was the first in the series, and is, as an"
348,MEMOIR.,"illustration of his peculiar style, worth better criticism than my own."
349,MEMOIR.,"Suffice it to state that which my friend Miss Mitford can confirm, that"
350,MEMOIR.,the simple recitation of 'Hamilton Tighe' has actually made persons
351,MEMOIR.,"start and turn pale, and complain of nervous excitement. 'Patty Morgan"
352,MEMOIR.,the Milkmaid's Story' and the 'Dead Drummer' were transmitted also
353,MEMOIR.,"to him through the same medium,--the former having been recounted"
354,MEMOIR.,"to us by Lady Eleanor Butler, as a whimsical Welsh legend which had"
355,MEMOIR.,"diverted her much; the latter by Sir Walter Scott, who, having better"
356,MEMOIR.,"means than most men of ascertaining facts and names, believed in their"
357,MEMOIR.,"authenticity. I think, but am not certain, that the 'Hand of Glory'"
358,MEMOIR.,was suggested by a conversation at our house on the subject of country
359,MEMOIR.,"superstition. Of the source of the remaining legends I am ignorant,"
360,MEMOIR.,save that the basis of some of them was furnished by an old Popish book
361,MEMOIR.,"in the library of Sion College, from which, as from other sources,"
362,MEMOIR.,Barham was wont to gratify his love of heraldry and antiquarianism ....
363,MEMOIR.,The _Ingoldsby Legends_ were the occasional relief of a suppressed
364,MEMOIR.,plethora of native fun.
365,MEMOIR.,
366,MEMOIR.,"""Many of these effusions were written while waiting for a cup of tea,"
367,MEMOIR.,"a railroad train, or an unpunctual acquaintance, on some stray cover"
368,MEMOIR.,of a letter in his pocket-book; one in particular served to relieve
369,MEMOIR.,the tedium of a hot walk up Richmond Hill. It was rather a piece of
370,MEMOIR.,luck if he found time to joint together the _disjecti membra poetæ_
371,MEMOIR.,in a fair copy; and before the favoured few had done laughing at some
372,MEMOIR.,"rhymes which had never entered a man's head before, the zealous Bentley"
373,MEMOIR.,"had popped the whole into type. After all, the imputed instances of"
374,MEMOIR.,inadvertence (for no one who knew him would style it irreverence)
375,MEMOIR.,"chiefly occur in that part of the series in which his purpose, to my"
376,MEMOIR.,"knowledge, was to quiz that spirit of flirtation with the Scarlet Lady"
377,MEMOIR.,"of Babylon, which had of late assumed a pretty marked shape; and it was"
378,MEMOIR.,difficult to prosecute this end without confounding the Scriptural St.
379,MEMOIR.,"Peter with the Dagon of the Vatican."""
380,MEMOIR.,
381,MEMOIR.,"We give these extracts from a letter written by Mr. John Hughes, of"
382,MEMOIR.,"Donnington Priory, to Mr. Ainsworth, believing that the reprinted"
383,MEMOIR.,report of a personal friend will be more interesting than a condensed
384,MEMOIR.,account of it. Mr. Hughes himself was a ripe scholar and a wit. He
385,MEMOIR.,"published poetical pleasantries, under the name of ""Mr. Butler of"
386,MEMOIR.,"Brasen-nose,"" in _Blackwood_ and _Ainsworth's Magazine_, and was the"
387,MEMOIR.,"father of Mr. Thomas Hughes, the author of _Tom Brown's Schooldays_."
388,MEMOIR.,
389,MEMOIR.,"""As regards the 'Dead Drummer,' the story was attested in a"
390,MEMOIR.,"contemporary pamphlet, called A Narrative of the Life, Confession,"
391,MEMOIR.,"and Dying Speech of Jarvis Matchan, which was signed by the Rev. J."
392,MEMOIR.,"Nicholson, who attended him as minister, and by another witness. The"
393,MEMOIR.,"murder was not committed on Salisbury Plain, but near Alconbury in"
394,MEMOIR.,"Huntingdonshire, and the culprit was hanged in chains at Huntingdon,"
395,MEMOIR.,"August 2nd, 1786, for the wilful murder of Benjamin Jones, a drummer"
396,MEMOIR.,"boy in the 48th Regiment of Foot, on August 19, 1780. Matchan's escape"
397,MEMOIR.,"to sea, and the subsequent vision on Salisbury Plain, which wrung"
398,MEMOIR.,"from him his confession, are given with great minuteness, and are as"
399,MEMOIR.,"marvellous as any in the poem."""
400,MEMOIR.,
401,MEMOIR.,"""Nell Cook,"" ""Grey Dolphin,"" ""The Ghost,"" and ""The Smuggler's Leap"""
402,MEMOIR.,"are Kentish legends, well known, though of course much embellished by"
403,MEMOIR.,"the poet. ""The Old Woman clothed in Grey"" was taken from the story of"
404,MEMOIR.,"a ghost that haunted an old rectory near Cambridge, whose custom it"
405,MEMOIR.,"was to stroll about the house at midnight, with a bag of money in"
406,MEMOIR.,"her hand, which she offered to whomever she met; but no one was brave"
407,MEMOIR.,enough to take it from her.
408,MEMOIR.,
409,MEMOIR.,The foundation of most of the legends on subjects of Popish
410,MEMOIR.,superstition may be found in the Monkish Chronicles which the
411,MEMOIR.,"library at Sion College contains. He tells us that the ""Jackdaw of"
412,MEMOIR.,"Rheims""--one, by the way, of his most popular legends--was a version of"
413,MEMOIR.,"an old Roman Catholic legend ""picked up"" out of a High Dutch author."
414,MEMOIR.,
415,MEMOIR.,"The strange details contained in ""The Singular Passage in the Life of"
416,MEMOIR.,"the late Dr. Harris"" were communicated to Mr. Barham by a young lady"
417,MEMOIR.,"on her sick-bed, who fully believed all she told him, and even urged"
418,MEMOIR.,"the arrest of the young man, to whose arts she believed herself to be"
419,MEMOIR.,a victim. She retained the delusion as long as she lived. The story
420,MEMOIR.,appeared first in _Blackwood_.
421,MEMOIR.,
422,MEMOIR.,"In 1839, Sidney Smith placed a Residentiary house, in Amen Corner, at"
423,MEMOIR.,"the disposal of Mr. Barham, and the family moved into it in September."
424,MEMOIR.,"This dwelling dated from the erection of the Cathedral itself, and,"
425,MEMOIR.,"having been long unoccupied, had become the stronghold of legions of"
426,MEMOIR.,"rats, which had first to be destroyed before the family could settle in"
427,MEMOIR.,it.
428,MEMOIR.,
429,MEMOIR.,"In 1840, Mr. Barham succeeded, in course of rotation, to the Presidency"
430,MEMOIR.,"of Sion College, which was held for one year only by the London"
431,MEMOIR.,incumbents in rotation.
432,MEMOIR.,
433,MEMOIR.,"The death of Theodore Hook, his life-long friend, occurred in 1841,"
434,MEMOIR.,"and Mr. Barham was deeply affected by it. ""One of the last parties at"
435,MEMOIR.,"which Hook was present"" (Mr. Barham's son tells us in his ""Memoirs"" of"
436,MEMOIR.,"his father) ""was at Amen Corner"" (Barham's house). He was unusually"
437,MEMOIR.,"late, and dinner was served before he made his appearance; Mr. Barham"
438,MEMOIR.,"apologized for having sat down without him, observing that he had quite"
439,MEMOIR.,"given him up, and supposed that the weather had deterred him."
440,MEMOIR.,
441,MEMOIR.,"""Oh,"" replied the former, ""I had determined to come--_weather_ or no."""
442,MEMOIR.,
443,MEMOIR.,The friends met only once more after that evening.
444,MEMOIR.,
445,MEMOIR.,"Within a year after taking up his abode at Amen Corner, a far heavier"
446,MEMOIR.,"sorrow had fallen on Mr. Barham. His youngest son, a boy of great"
447,MEMOIR.,"promise and precocious talent, died. His second son had died of cholera"
448,MEMOIR.,in 1832. This last blow fell heavily on the father. His elastic spirits
449,MEMOIR.,"had rebounded from the previous ones, but this loss was never fully"
450,MEMOIR.,"recovered by him. The death of Hook, coming soon after, depressed him"
451,MEMOIR.,still more.
452,MEMOIR.,
453,MEMOIR.,"In 1842, Mr. Barham was appointed to the Divinity Readership of St."
454,MEMOIR.,"Paul's, and was permitted to exchange the living he held for the more"
455,MEMOIR.,"valuable one of St. Faith; the duties of which were, also, less onerous"
456,MEMOIR.,than those of the parish in which he had worked for twenty years.
457,MEMOIR.,
458,MEMOIR.,His parishioners felt the separation from their excellent pastor
459,MEMOIR.,"deeply, and no doubt their feelings were shared by him who had so long"
460,MEMOIR.,been their guide and sympathetic friend. Mrs. Barham was also greatly
461,MEMOIR.,"loved, and had rendered good service in the management of the school,"
462,MEMOIR.,and visiting the poor; a testimonial was presented to both by their
463,MEMOIR.,"grateful people, in the shape of a handsome silver salver."
464,MEMOIR.,
465,MEMOIR.,"His new living being contiguous to his old one, Mr. Barham did not"
466,MEMOIR.,"change his residence, in which, in fact, he was permitted to live for"
467,MEMOIR.,the remainder of his life. But he was always delighted when a little
468,MEMOIR.,"leisure enabled him to go into the country and to the seaside, or to"
469,MEMOIR.,his native Kent to find legends; but such excursions were few and brief
470,MEMOIR.,for the hardly worked clergyman.
471,MEMOIR.,
472,MEMOIR.,Mr. Barham was one of the first members of the Archæological
473,MEMOIR.,"Association, instituted for the purpose of making trips to places where"
474,MEMOIR.,antiquarian research could be carried on; he had always possessed a
475,MEMOIR.,"great taste for, and much knowledge of, antiquarian subjects. He was"
476,MEMOIR.,"also an excellent Shakspearian scholar, and could supply the context"
477,MEMOIR.,"to any quotation made from the plays, and mention the play, act,"
478,MEMOIR.,and generally the scene from which it came. He was therefore deeply
479,MEMOIR.,"interested in the formation of the Garrick Club, of which he wrote"
480,MEMOIR.,the words of a glee song at the opening dinner (the music was by Mr.
481,MEMOIR.,"Hawes),--"
482,MEMOIR.,
483,MEMOIR.,Let poets of superior parts
484,MEMOIR.,Consign to deathless fame
485,MEMOIR.,"The larceny of the Knave of Hearts,"
486,MEMOIR.,Who spoiled his Royal Dame.
487,MEMOIR.,
488,MEMOIR.,Alack! my timid muse would quail
489,MEMOIR.,"Before such thievish cubs,"
490,MEMOIR.,But plumes a joyous wing to hail
491,MEMOIR.,"Thy birth, fair Queen of _Clubs_."
492,MEMOIR.,
493,MEMOIR.,"On October 28, 1844, Her Majesty the Queen visited the city to open"
494,MEMOIR.,"the Royal Exchange. Mr. Barham, his wife and daughters, had accepted"
495,MEMOIR.,"an invitation from a friend to witness the procession, and, standing"
496,MEMOIR.,"at an open window, he remarked that the cutting east wind then blowing"
497,MEMOIR.,would cost many of the spectators their lives. The speech seemed in
498,MEMOIR.,his own case prophetic. In the course of the evening he was attacked
499,MEMOIR.,"by a violent fit of coughing, and his old friend and schoolfellow Dr."
500,MEMOIR.,"Roberts was called in. The poet rallied from this attack, but fresh"
501,MEMOIR.,"ones succeeded it, and at length his articulation became impeded. He"
502,MEMOIR.,"was advised to leave London for Bath, rest being absolutely necessary;"
503,MEMOIR.,but a meeting of the Archæological Association induced him to hurry
504,MEMOIR.,"back to town to attend it, and then other business pressed on him, and"
505,MEMOIR.,another attack followed. His son relates a little incident that shows
506,MEMOIR.,Barham had begun to realize the serious nature of his illness. He had
507,MEMOIR.,"been for many years on the Committee of the Garrick Club, and by the"
508,MEMOIR.,rules of the society the names of the Committee were placed in a ballot
509,MEMOIR.,"box and six withdrawn, by chance, on St. George's day, which was the"
510,MEMOIR.,anniversary of the birth and death of Shakspeare. The first name drawn
511,MEMOIR.,out that year was Barham's; but he was unanimously re-elected. When
512,MEMOIR.,"he was told of the circumstance, he said: It had been well to have"
513,MEMOIR.,"accepted the omen, and filled up his place at once. In fact he never"
514,MEMOIR.,entered the Club again.
515,MEMOIR.,
516,MEMOIR.,Mrs. Barham had also been ill; therefore he and she went together in
517,MEMOIR.,"the following May to Clifton, for change of air and rest; but unhappily"
518,MEMOIR.,they had only been a few hours in their lodgings before Mrs. Barham
519,MEMOIR.,"was taken dangerously ill, and unable to attend to her husband. Their"
520,MEMOIR.,"eldest daughter soon joined them, and a slight amendment enabled her"
521,MEMOIR.,to bring them back to their home; but the expedition proved to have
522,MEMOIR.,"been a fatal one. Here Dr. Roberts, and the great surgeon Coulson, did"
523,MEMOIR.,all that was possible to save the life of the beloved poet. But they
524,MEMOIR.,"knew that their skill was vain, and their patient readily divined the"
525,MEMOIR.,truth that he was dying. He learned the certainty of the approaching
526,MEMOIR.,"end with perfect calmness and cheerfulness, only disturbed by anxiety"
527,MEMOIR.,"about his wife, who was still extremely ill. He arranged his worldly"
528,MEMOIR.,affairs; received the Holy Communion with his household; and waited
529,MEMOIR.,for the certain result of his malady with patience and resolution. His
530,MEMOIR.,"last lines, ""As I lay a-thinking,"" referring chiefly to the death of"
531,MEMOIR.,"his youngest son, were written, his son tells us, just before he left"
532,MEMOIR.,Clifton; he now desired that they might be sent to Mr. Bentley for
533,MEMOIR.,publication.
534,MEMOIR.,
535,MEMOIR.,He died on the 17th of June 1845. His life as a clergyman had been most
536,MEMOIR.,useful and beneficial to his parishioners; his poems have cheered many
537,MEMOIR.,"a weary spirit, and been a source of much innocent household mirth."
538,MEMOIR.,
539,MEMOIR.,The _Ingoldsby Legends_ are not only remarkable for their humour; they
540,MEMOIR.,are equally to be praised for their wonderful versification. That he
541,MEMOIR.,was a perfect master of the language who could thus use every variety
542,MEMOIR.,"of stanza, and find rhymes for the most extraordinary, even technical"
543,MEMOIR.,"words, no one can doubt; there are no harsh lines or imperfect rhymes"
544,MEMOIR.,"in the Legends, and the wit and mirth are charmingly blended at times"
545,MEMOIR.,with touching pathos. The poet's antiquarian knowledge gives much
546,MEMOIR.,"effect, also, to his tales, and there is never anything in his most"
547,MEMOIR.,comic relations that would be unworthy the pen of a gentleman and a
548,MEMOIR.,cultured scholar. England has cause to be proud of such a writer as
549,MEMOIR.,"""Thomas Ingoldsby,"" otherwise Richard Harris Barham."

603,"MY DEAR SIR,","In order utterly to squabash and demolish every gainsayer, I had"
604,"MY DEAR SIR,","thought, at one time, of asking my old and esteemed friend, Richard"
605,"MY DEAR SIR,","Lane, to crush them at once with his magic pencil, and to transmit my"
606,"MY DEAR SIR,","features to posterity, where all his works are sure to be ""delivered"

608,"MY DEAR SIR,",which he has recently executed of the Kemble family put me a little
609,"MY DEAR SIR,","out of conceit with my own, while the undisguised amusement which my"
610,"MY DEAR SIR,","""Mephistopheles Eyebrow,"" as he termed it, afforded him, in the ""full"
611,"MY DEAR SIR,","face,"" induced me to lay aside the design. Besides, my dear Sir, since,"

670,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"bedstead, in an old-fashioned apartment of a still more old-fashioned"
671,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"manor-house; ""'tis confoundedly odd, and I can't make it out at all."
672,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Why, Barney, where are they?--and where the d--l are you?"""
673,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
674,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"No answer was returned to this appeal; and the lieutenant, who was, in"
675,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the main, a reasonable person,--at least as reasonable a person as any"
676,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"young gentleman of twenty-two in ""the service"" can fairly be expected"
677,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"to be,--cooled when he reflected that his servant could scarcely reply"

681,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,footsteps of as tight a lad as ever put pipe-clay to belt sounded along

724,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,The question was more easily asked than answered. Barney renewed his
725,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"search, while the lieutenant folded his arms, and, leaning against the"
726,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"toilet, sunk into a reverie."
727,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
728,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""After all, it must be some trick of my laughter-loving cousins,"" said"
729,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Seaforth.
730,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
731,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Ah! then, the ladies!"" chimed in Mr. Maguire, though the observation"
732,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"was not addressed to him; ""and will it be Miss Caroline, or Miss Fanny,"
733,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"that's stole your honour's things?"""
734,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
735,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""I hardly know what to think of it,"" pursued the bereaved lieutenant,"
736,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"still speaking in soliloquy, with his eye resting dubiously on the"
737,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"chamber-door. ""I locked myself in, that's certain; and--but there must"
738,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,be some other entrance to the room--pooh! I remember--the private
739,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"staircase; how could I be such a fool?"" and he crossed the chamber to"
740,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,where a low oaken doorcase was dimly visible in a distant corner. He
741,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,paused before it. Nothing now interfered to screen it from observation;
742,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,but it bore tokens of having been at some earlier period concealed by
743,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"tapestry, remains of which yet clothed the walls on either side the"
744,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,portal.
745,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
746,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""This way they must have come,"" said Seaforth; ""I wish with all my"
747,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"heart I had caught them!"""
748,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
749,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Och! the kittens!"" sighed Mr. Barney Maguire."
750,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
751,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"But the mystery was yet as far from being solved as before. True, there"
752,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"_was_ the ""other door;"" but then that, too, on examination, was even"
753,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"more firmly secured than the one which opened on the gallery,--two"
754,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,heavy bolts on the inside effectually prevented any _coup de main_ on
755,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,the lieutenant's _bivouac_ from that quarter. He was more puzzled than
756,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,ever; nor did the minutest inspection of the walls and floor throw any
757,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"light upon the subject! one thing only was clear,--the breeches were"
758,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"gone! ""It is _very_ singular,"" said the lieutenant."

761,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
762,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Tappington (generally called Tapton) Everard is an antiquated but
763,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,commodious manor-house in the eastern division of the county of Kent. A
764,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"former proprietor had been High-sheriff in the days of Elizabeth, and"
765,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,many a dark and dismal tradition was yet extant of the licentiousness
766,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"of his life, and the enormity of his offences. The Glen, which the"
767,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"keeper's daughter was seen to enter, but never known to quit, still"
768,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,frowns darkly as of yore; while an ineradicable bloodstain on the oaken
769,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,stair yet bids defiance to the united energies of soap and sand. But it
770,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,is with one particular apartment that a deed of more especial atrocity
771,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,is said to be connected. A stranger guest--so runs the legend--arrived
772,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"unexpectedly at the mansion of the ""Bad Sir Giles."" They met in"
773,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,apparent friendship; but the ill-concealed scowl on their master's brow
774,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"told the domestics that the visit was not a welcome one; the banquet,"
775,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"however, was not spared; the wine-cup circulated freely,--too freely,"
776,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"perhaps,--for sounds of discord at length reached the ears of even the"
777,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,excluded serving-men as they were doing their best to imitate their
778,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"betters in the lower hall. Alarmed, some of them ventured to approach"
779,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the parlour; one, an old and favoured retainer of the house, went so"
780,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"far as to break in upon his master's privacy. Sir Giles, already high"
781,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"in oath, fiercely enjoined his absence, and he retired; not, however,"
782,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,before he had distinctly heard from the stranger's lips a menace that
783,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""There was that within his pocket which could disprove the knight's"
784,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"right to issue that or any other command within the walls of Tapton."""
785,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
786,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"The intrusion, though momentary, seemed to have produced a beneficial"
787,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"effect; the voices of the disputants fell, and the conversation was"
788,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"carried on thenceforth in a more subdued tone, till, as evening closed"
789,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"in, the domestics, when summoned to attend with lights, found not only"
790,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"cordiality restored, but that a still deeper carouse was meditated."
791,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Fresh stoups, and from the choicest bins, were produced; nor was it"
792,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"till at a late, or rather early hour, that the revellers sought their"
793,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,chambers.
794,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
795,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,The one allotted to the stranger occupied the first floor of the
796,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"eastern angle of the building, and had once been the favourite"
797,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,apartment of Sir Giles himself. Scandal ascribed this preference to the
798,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"facility which a private staircase, communicating with the grounds, had"
799,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"afforded him, in the old knight's time, of following his wicked courses"
800,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,unchecked by parental observation; a consideration which ceased to be
801,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,of weight when the death of his father left him uncontrolled master
802,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,of his estate and actions. From that period Sir Giles had established
803,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"himself in what were called the ""state apartments;"" and the ""oaken"
804,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"chamber"" was rarely tenanted, save on occasions of extraordinary"
805,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"festivity, or when the yule log drew an unusually large accession of"
806,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,guests around the Christmas hearth.
807,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
808,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"On this eventful night it was prepared for the unknown visitor, who"
809,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"sought his couch heated and inflamed from his midnight orgies, and"
810,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,in the morning was found in his bed a swollen and blackened corpse.
811,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,No marks of violence appeared upon the body; but the livid hue of
812,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the lips, and certain dark-coloured spots visible on the skin,"
813,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,aroused suspicions which those who entertained them were too timid to
814,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"express. Apoplexy, induced by the excesses of the preceding night, Sir"
815,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Giles's confidential leech pronounced to be the cause of his sudden
816,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,dissolution; the body was buried in peace; and though some shook their
817,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,heads as they witnessed the haste with which the funeral rites were
818,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"hurried on, none ventured to murmur. Other events arose to distract the"
819,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,attention of the retainers; men's minds became occupied by the stirring
820,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"politics of the day, while the near approach of that formidable"
821,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"armada, so vainly arrogating to itself a title which the very elements"
822,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"joined with human valour to disprove, soon interfered to weaken, if"
823,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"not obliterate, all remembrance of the nameless stranger who had died"
824,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,within the walls of Tapton Everard.
825,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
826,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Years rolled on: the ""Bad Sir Giles"" had himself long since gone to his"
827,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"account, the last, as it was believed, of his immediate line; though"
828,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,a few of the older tenants were sometimes heard to speak of an elder
829,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"brother, who had disappeared in early life, and never inherited the"
830,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"estate. Rumours, too, of his having left a son in foreign lands were at"
831,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"one time rife; but they died away, nothing occurring to support them:"
832,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the property passed unchallenged to a collateral branch of the family,"
833,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"and the secret, if secret there were, was buried in Denton churchyard,"
834,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,in the lonely grave of the mysterious stranger. One circumstance
835,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"alone occurred, after a long-intervening period, to revive the memory"
836,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,of these transactions. Some workmen employed in grubbing an old
837,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"plantation, for the purpose of raising on its site a modern shrubbery,"
838,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"dug up, in the execution of their task, the mildewed remnants of what"
839,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"seemed to have been once a garment. On more minute inspection, enough"
840,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,remained of silken slashes and a coarse embroidery to identify the
841,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,relics as having once formed part of a pair of trunk hose; while a few
842,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"papers which fell from them, altogether illegible from damp and age,"
843,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,were by the unlearned rustics conveyed to the then owner of the estate.
844,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
845,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Whether the squire was more successful in deciphering them was never
846,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,known; he certainly never alluded to their contents; and little would
847,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,have been thought of the matter but for the inconvenient memory of one
848,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"old woman, who declared she heard her grandfather say that when the"
849,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""stranger guest"" was poisoned, though all the rest of his clothes were"
850,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"there, his breeches, the supposed repository of the supposed documents,"
851,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,could never be found. The master of Tapton Everard smiled when he heard
852,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Dame Jones's hint of deeds which might impeach the validity of his own
853,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,title in favour of some unknown descendant of some unknown heir; and
854,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the story was rarely alluded to, save by one or two miracle-mongers,"
855,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"who had heard that others had seen the ghost of old Sir Giles, in his"
856,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"night-cap, issue from the postern, enter the adjoining copse, and wring"
857,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"his shadowy hands in agony, as he seemed to search vainly for something"
858,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"hidden among the evergreens. The stranger's death-room had, of course,"
859,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,been occasionally haunted from the time of his decease; but the periods
860,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"of visitation had latterly become very rare,--even Mrs. Botherby, the"
861,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"housekeeper, being forced to admit that, during her long sojourn at the"
862,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"manor, she had never ""met with anything worse than herself;"" though, as"
863,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the old lady afterwards added upon more mature reflection, ""I must say"
864,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"I think I saw the devil _once_."""
865,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
866,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Such was the legend attached to Tapton Everard, and such the story"
867,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,which the lively Caroline Ingoldsby detailed to her equally mercurial
868,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"cousin Charles Seaforth, lieutenant in the Hon. East India Company's"
869,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"second regiment of Bombay Fencibles, as arm-in-arm they promenaded a"
870,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"gallery decked with some dozen grim-looking ancestral portraits, and,"
871,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"among others, with that of the redoubted Sir Giles himself. The gallant"
872,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,commander had that very morning paid his first visit to the house of
873,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"his maternal uncle, after an absence of several years passed with his"
874,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"regiment on the arid plains of Hindostan, whence he was now returned on"
875,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"a three years' furlough. He had gone out a boy,--he returned a man; but"
876,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,the impression made upon his youthful fancy by his favourite cousin
877,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"remained unimpaired, and to Tapton he directed his steps, even before"
878,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"he sought the home of his widowed mother,--comforting himself in this"
879,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"breach of filial decorum by the reflection that, as the manor was so"
880,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"little out of his way, it would be unkind to pass, as it were, the door"
881,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,of his relatives without just looking in for a few hours.
882,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
883,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,But he found his uncle as hospitable and his cousin more charming
884,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"than ever; and the looks of one, and the requests of the other, soon"
885,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"precluded the possibility of refusing to lengthen the ""few hours"" into"
886,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"a few days, though the house was at the moment full of visitors."
887,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
888,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"The Peterses were there from Ramsgate; and Mr., Mrs., and the two Miss"
889,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Simpkinsons, from Bath, had come to pass a month with the family;"
890,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,and Tom Ingoldsby had brought down his college friend the Honourable
891,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Augustus Sucklethumbkin, with his groom and pointers, to take a"
892,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"fortnight's shooting. And then there was Mrs. Ogleton, the rich young"
893,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"widow, with her large black eyes, who, people did say, was setting"
894,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"her cap at the young squire, though Mrs. Botherby did not believe"
895,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"it; and, above all, there was Mademoiselle Pauline, her _femme de"
896,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"chambre_, who ""_mon-Dieu_'d"" everything and everybody, and cried ""_Quel"
897,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"horreur!_"" at Mrs. Botherby's cap. In short, to use the last-named and"
898,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"much-respected lady's own expression, the house was ""choke-full"" to the"
899,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"very attics,--all, save the ""oaken chamber,"" which, as the lieutenant"
900,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"expressed a most magnanimous disregard of ghosts, was forthwith"
901,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,appropriated to his particular accommodation. Mr. Maguire meanwhile
902,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"was fain to share the apartment of Oliver Dobbs, the squire's own man:"
903,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,a jocular proposal of joint occupancy having been first indignantly
904,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"rejected by ""Mademoiselle,"" though preferred with the ""laste taste in"

936,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"was evidently _distrait_, which the fair Caroline in her secret soul"
937,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"attributed to his being solely occupied by her _agrémens_,--how would"

1011,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"liberal education at a charity-school, and was apt to recur to the days"
1012,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"of his muffin-cap and leathers. As usual, he took his wife's hint in"

1014,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1015,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""A glorious day for the ruins!"" said young Ingoldsby. ""But, Charles,"
1016,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,what the deuce are you about?--you don't mean to ride through our lanes
1017,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"in such toggery as that?"""
1018,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,

1022,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1023,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,But this proposition was at once overruled; Mrs. Ogleton had already
1024,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"nailed the cab, a vehicle of all others the best adapted for a snug"
1025,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,flirtation.
1026,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1027,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Or drive Miss Julia in the phaeton?"" No; that was the post of Mr."
1028,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Peters, who, indifferent as an equestrian, had acquired some fame as"
1029,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,a whip while travelling through the midland counties for the firm of
1030,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Bagshaw, Snivelby, and Ghrimes."
1031,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1032,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Thank you, I shall ride with my cousins,"" said Charles, with as much"
1033,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"_nonchalance_ as he could assume,--and he did so; Mr. Ingoldsby, Mrs."
1034,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Peters, Mr. Simpkinson from Bath, and his eldest daughter with her"
1035,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"_album_, following in the family coach. The gentleman-commoner ""voted"

1037,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"of the gamekeeper and a cigar. ""There was 'no fun' in looking at old"

1039,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"with Mrs. Botherby, who had promised to initiate her in that grand"

1048,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1049,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Miss Simpkinson closed her album with an air of ineffable disdain.
1050,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1051,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Mr. Simpkinson from Bath was a professed antiquary, and one of the"
1052,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"first water; he was master of Gwillim's Heraldry, and Milles's History"
1053,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,of the Crusades; knew every plate in the Monasticon; had written an
1054,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"essay on the origin and dignity of the office of overseer, and settled"
1055,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,the date of a Queen Anne's farthing. An influential member of the
1056,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Antiquarian Society, to whose ""Beauties of Bagnigge Wells"" he had"
1057,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"been a liberal subscriber, procured him a seat at the board of that"
1058,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"learned body, since which happy epoch Sylvanus Urban had not a more"
1059,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,indefatigable correspondent. His inaugural essay on the President's
1060,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,cocked hat was considered a miracle of erudition: and his account of
1061,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the earliest application of gilding to gingerbread, a masterpiece of"
1062,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,antiquarian research. His eldest daughter was of a kindred spirit: if
1063,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"her father's mantle had not fallen upon her, it was only because he had"
1064,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"not thrown it off himself; she had caught hold of its tail, however,"
1065,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"while it yet hung upon his honoured shoulders. To souls so congenial,"
1066,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"what a sight was the magnificent ruin of Bolsover! its broken arches,"
1067,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"its mouldering pinnacles, and the airy tracery of its half-demolished"
1068,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,windows. The party were in raptures; Mr. Simpkinson began to meditate
1069,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"an essay, and his daughter an ode: even Seaforth, as he gazed on"
1070,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"these lonely relics of the olden time, was betrayed into a momentary"
1071,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,forgetfulness of his love and losses; the widow's eye-glass turned from
1072,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,her _cicisbeo's_ whiskers to the mantling ivy: Mrs. Peters wiped her
1073,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"spectacles; and ""her P."" supposed the central tower ""had once been the"
1074,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"county jail."" The squire was a philosopher, and had been there often"

1077,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Bolsover Priory,"" said Mr. Simpkinson, with the air of a"

1125,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1126,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""I've heard of him,"" broke in the incorrigible Peters; ""he was hanged"

1128,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1129,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"The antiquary vouchsafed no notice of the interruption; but, taking a"

1135,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"find that Langhale in Co. Norf. was held by one Baldwin _per saltum,"
1136,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"sufflatum, et pettum_; that is, he was to come every Christmas into"

1143,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Mrs. Ogleton challenges you, sir; she insists upon it,"" said Tom,"
1144,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"still more rapidly; at the same time filling a glass, and forcing it on"
1145,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the _sçavant_, who, thus arrested in the very crisis of his narrative,"
1146,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,received and swallowed the potation as if it had been physic.
1147,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1148,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""What on earth has Miss Simpkinson discovered there?"" continued Tom;"
1149,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""something of interest. See how fast she is writing."""
1150,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1151,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"The diversion was effectual: every one looked towards Miss Simpkinson,"
1152,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"who, far too ethereal for ""creature comforts,"" was seated apart on"
1153,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the dilapidated remains of an altar-tomb, committing eagerly to paper"
1154,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"something that had strongly impressed her: the air,--the eye ""in a fine"
1155,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"frenzy rolling,""--all betokened that the divine _afflatus_ was come."
1156,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Her father rose, and stole silently towards her."
1157,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1158,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""What an old boar!"" muttered young Ingoldsby; alluding, perhaps, to a"
1159,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"slice of brawn which he had just begun to operate upon, but which, from"
1160,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the celerity with which it disappeared, did not seem so very difficult"
1161,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,of mastication.
1162,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1163,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,But what had become of Seaforth and his fair Caroline all this while?
1164,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Why, it so happened that they had been simultaneously stricken with"
1165,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the picturesque appearance of one of those high and pointed arches,"
1166,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"which that eminent antiquary, Mr. Horseley Curties, has described in"
1167,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"his ""Ancient Records"" as ""a _Gothic_ window of the _Saxon_ order;""--and"
1168,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,then the ivy clustered so thickly and so beautifully on the other
1169,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"side, that they went round to look at that;--and then their proximity"
1170,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"deprived it of half its effect, and so they walked across to a little"
1171,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"knoll, a hundred yards off, and in crossing a small ravine, they came"
1172,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"to what in Ireland they call ""a bad step,"" and Charles had to carry his"
1173,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"cousin over it;--and then, when they had to come back, she would not"
1174,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"give him the trouble again for the world, so they followed a better but"
1175,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"more circuitous route, and there were hedges and ditches in the way,"
1176,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"and stiles to get over, and gates to get through; so that an hour or"
1177,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,more had elapsed before they were able to rejoin the party.
1178,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1179,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Lassy me!"" said Miss Julia Simpkinson, ""how long you have been gone!"""
1180,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1181,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,And so they had. The remark was a very just as well as a very natural
1182,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"one. They were gone a long while, and a nice cosey chat they had; and"
1183,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"what do you think it was all about, my dear miss?"
1184,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1185,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""O, lassy me! love, no doubt, and the moon, and eyes, and nightingales,"
1186,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"and--"""
1187,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1188,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Stay, stay, my sweet young lady; do not let the fervour of your"
1189,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"feelings run away with you! I do not pretend to say, indeed, that one"
1190,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,or more of these pretty subjects might not have been introduced; but
1191,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,the most important and leading topic of the conference was--Lieutenant
1192,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Seaforth's breeches.
1193,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1194,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Caroline,"" said Charles, ""I have had some very odd dreams since I have"

1196,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1197,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Dreams, have you?"" smiled the young lady, arching her taper neck like"
1198,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"a swan in pluming. ""Dreams, have you?"""
1199,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1200,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Ay, dreams,--or dream, perhaps, I should say; for, though repeated, it"
1201,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"was still the same. And what do you imagine was its subject?"""
1202,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1203,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""It is impossible for me to divine,"" said the tongue;--""I have not the"
1204,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"least difficulty in guessing,"" said the eye, as plainly as ever eye"
1205,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,spoke.
1206,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1207,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""I dreamt--of your great grandfather!"""
1208,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1209,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"There was a change in the glance--""My great grandfather?"""
1210,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1211,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Yes, the old Sir Giles, or Sir John, you told me about the other day:"
1212,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"he walked into my bedroom in his short cloak of murrey-coloured velvet,"
1213,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"his long rapier, and his Raleigh-looking hat and feather, just as the"
1214,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"picture represents him: but with one exception."""
1215,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1216,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""And what was that?"""
1217,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1218,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Why, his lower extremities, which were visible, were--those of a"
1219,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"skeleton."""
1220,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1221,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Well."""
1222,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1223,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Well, after taking a turn or two about the room, and looking round him"
1224,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"with a wistful air, he came to the bed's foot, stared at me in a manner"
1225,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"impossible to describe,--and then he--he laid hold of my pantaloons;"
1226,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,whipped his long bony legs into them in a twinkling; and strutting up
1227,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"to the glass, seemed to view himself in it with great complacency. I"
1228,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"tried to speak, but in vain. The effort, however, seemed to excite"
1229,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"his attention; for, wheeling about, he showed me the grimmest-looking"
1230,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"death's head you can well imagine, and with an indescribable grin"
1231,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"strutted out of the room."""
1232,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1233,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Absurd! Charles. How can you talk such nonsense?"""

1238,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1239,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"On the following morning, contrary to his usual custom, Seaforth"
1240,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,was the first person in the breakfast parlour. As no one else was
1241,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"present, he did precisely what nine young men out of ten so"
1242,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"situated would have done; he walked up to the mantel-piece,"
1243,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"established himself upon the rug, and subducting his coat-tails one"
1244,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"under each arm, turned towards the fire that portion of the human"
1245,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,frame which it is considered equally indecorous to present to a
1246,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"friend or an enemy. A serious, not to say anxious, expression was"
1247,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"visible upon his good-humoured countenance, and his mouth was"
1248,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"fast buttoning itself up for an incipient whistle, when little Flo, a"
1249,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"tiny spaniel of the Blenheim breed,--the pet object of Miss Julia"
1250,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Simpkinson's affections,--bounced out from beneath a sofa, and"
1251,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,began to bark at--his pantaloons.
1252,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1253,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"They were cleverly ""built,"" of a light grey mixture, a broad stripe"
1254,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,of the most vivid scarlet traversing each seam in a perpendicular
1255,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"direction from hip to ankle,--in short, the regimental costume of"
1256,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the Royal Bombay Fencibles. The animal, educated in the country,"
1257,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,had never seen such a pair of breeches in her life--_Omne ignotum
1258,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"pro magnifico!_ The scarlet streak, inflamed as it was by the"
1259,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"reflection of the fire, seemed to act on Flora's nerves as the same"
1260,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,colour does on those of bulls and turkeys; she advanced at the _pas
1261,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"de charge_, and her vociferation, like her amazement, was unbounded."
1262,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"A sound kick from the disgusted officer changed its character, and"
1263,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,induced a retreat at the very moment when the mistress of the
1264,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,pugnacious quadruped entered to the rescue.
1265,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1266,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Lassy me! Flo! what _is_ the matter?"" cried the sympathising"
1267,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"lady, with a scrutinising glance levelled at the gentleman."
1268,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1269,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,It might as well have lighted on a feather bed.--His air of
1270,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,imperturbable unconsciousness defied examination; and as he would
1271,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"not, and Flora could not expound, that injured individual was compelled"
1272,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,to pocket up her wrongs. Others of the household soon
1273,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"dropped in, and clustered round the board dedicated to the most"
1274,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"sociable of meals; the urn was paraded ""hissing hot,"" and the cups"
1275,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"which ""cheer, but not inebriate,"" steamed redolent of hyson and"
1276,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"pekoe; muffins and marmalade, newspapers and Finnon haddies,"
1277,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,left little room for observation on the character of Charles's warlike
1278,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""turn-out."" At length a look from Caroline, followed by a smile"
1279,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"that nearly ripened to a titter, caused him to turn abruptly and"
1280,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"address his neighbour. It was Miss Simpkinson, who, deeply"
1281,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"engaged in sipping her tea and turning over her album, seemed,"
1282,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"like a female Chrononotonthologos, ""immersed in cogibundity of"
1283,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"cogitation."" An interrogatory on the subject of her studies drew"
1284,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,from her the confession that she was at that moment employed in
1285,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,putting the finishing touches to a poem inspired by the romantic
1286,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,shades of Bolsover. The entreaties of the company were of course
1287,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"urgent. Mr. Peters, ""who liked verses,"" was especially persevering,"
1288,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,and Sappho at length compliant. After a preparatory hem! and a
1289,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,glance at the mirror to ascertain that her look was sufficiently
1290,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"sentimental, the poetess began:--"
1291,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1292,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""There is a calm, a holy feeling,"
1293,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Vulgar minds can never know,"
1294,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"O'er the bosom softly stealing,--"
1295,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Chasten'd grief, delicious woe!"
1296,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Oh! how sweet at eve regaining
1297,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Yon lone tower's sequester'd shade--

1299,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1300,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,--Yow!--yeough!--yeough!--yow!--yow! yelled a hapless sufferer from
1301,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,beneath the table.--It was an unlucky hour for quadrupeds; and if
1302,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""every dog will have his day,"" he could not have selected a more"
1303,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"unpropitious one than this. Mrs. Ogleton, too, had a pet,--a favourite"
1304,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"pug,--whose squab figure, black muzzle, and tortuosity of tail, that"
1305,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"curled like a head of celery in a salad-bowl, bespoke his Dutch"
1306,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"extraction. Yow! yow! yow! continued the brute,--a chorus in which Flo"
1307,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"instantly joined. Sooth to say, pug had more reason to express his"
1308,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,dissatisfaction than was given him by the muse of Simpkinson; the other
1309,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,only barked for company. Scarcely had the poetess got through her first
1310,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"stanza, when Tom Ingoldsby, in the enthusiasm of the moment, became so"
1311,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"lost in the material world, that, in his abstraction, he unwarily laid"
1312,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"his hand on the cock of the urn. Quivering with emotion, he gave it"
1313,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"such an unlucky twist, that the full stream of its scalding contents"
1314,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,descended on the gingerbread hide of the unlucky Cupid.--The confusion
1315,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,was complete;--the whole economy of the table disarranged;--the company
1316,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"broke up in most admired disorder;--and ""Vulgar minds will never know"""
1317,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,anything more of Miss Simpkinson's ode till they peruse it in some

1320,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Seaforth profited by the confusion to take the delinquent who had
1321,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"caused this ""stramash"" by the arm, and to lead him to the lawn, where"
1322,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,he had a word or two for his private ear. The conference between the
1323,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,young gentlemen was neither brief in its duration nor unimportant in
1324,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"its result. The subject was what the lawyers call tripartite, embracing"
1325,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,the information that Charles Seaforth was over head and ears in love
1326,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"with Tom Ingoldsby's sister; secondly, that the lady had referred"
1327,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"him to ""papa"" for his sanction; thirdly and lastly, his nightly"
1328,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"visitations, and consequent bereavement. At the two first items Tom"
1329,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"smiled auspiciously; at the last he burst out into an absolute ""guffaw."""
1330,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1331,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Steal your breeches!--Miss Bailey over again, by Jove,"" shouted"
1332,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Ingoldsby. ""But a gentleman, you say,--and Sir Giles too.--I am not"
1333,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"sure, Charles, whether I ought not to call you out for aspersing the"

1335,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1336,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Laugh as you will, Tom,--be as incredulous as you please. One fact is"
1337,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"incontestible,--the breeches are gone! Look here--I am reduced to my"

1339,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1340,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Rochefoucault says, there is something in the misfortunes of our very"

1343,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"them. Tom composed his features on the instant, and replied with more"
1344,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"gravity, as well as with an expletive, which, if my Lord Mayor had been"
1345,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"within hearing, might have cost him five shillings."

1347,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""There is something very queer in this, after all. The clothes, you"

1350,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"something yesterday of his kicking up a bobbery in the kitchen, and"

1354,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"It now struck the lieutenant at once, that the usually buoyant spirits"
1355,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"of his attendant had of late been materially sobered down, his"

1357,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,had actually rung his bell three several times that very morning before
1358,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"he could procure his attendance. Mr. Maguire was forthwith summoned,"
1359,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"and underwent a close examination. The ""bobbery"" was easily explained."
1360,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Mr. Oliver Dobbs had hinted his disapprobation of a flirtation carrying
1361,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,on between the gentleman from Munster and the lady from the Rue St.
1362,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Honoré. Mademoiselle had boxed Mr. Maguire's ears, and Mr. Maguire had"

1365,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"said it was ""scandalous,"" and what ought not to be done in any moral"
1366,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,kitchen; and Mr. Maguire had got hold of the Honourable Augustus
1367,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Sucklethumbkin's powder-flask, and had put large pinches of the best"
1368,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,double Dartford into Mr. Dobbs's tobacco-box;--and Mr. Dobbs's pipe had
1369,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"exploded, and set fire to Mrs. Botherby's Sunday cap;--and Mr. Maguire"
1370,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"had put it out with the slop-basin, ""barring the wig;""--and then they"
1371,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"were all so ""cantankerous,"" that Barney had gone to take a walk in the"
1372,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,garden; and then--then Mr. Barney had seen a ghost!!
1373,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1374,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""A what? you blockhead!"" asked Tom Ingoldsby."

1401,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1402,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Mr. Maguire's account was received with avowed incredulity by both

1422,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,it only to the disgraceful innovations of modern degeneracy upon the
1423,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"sober and dignified habits of our ancestors. I can introduce him, it is"
1424,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"true, into an old and high-roofed chamber, its walls covered on three"
1425,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"sides with black oak wainscotting, adorned with carvings of fruit and"
1426,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,flowers long anterior to those of Grinling Gibbons; the fourth side is
1427,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"clothed with a curious remnant of dingy tapestry, once elucidatory of"
1428,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"some Scriptural history, but of _which_ not even Mrs. Botherby could"
1429,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"determine. Mr. Simpkinson, who had examined it carefully, inclined"
1430,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"to believe the principal figure to be either Bathsheba, or Daniel in"
1431,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,the lions' den; while Tom Ingoldsby decided in favour of the King of
1432,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Bashan. All, however, was conjecture, tradition being silent on the"
1433,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"subject.--A lofty arched portal led into, and a little arched portal"
1434,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"led out of, this apartment; they were opposite each other, and each"
1435,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"possessed the security of massy bolts on its interior. The bedstead,"
1436,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"too, was not one of yesterday, but manifestly coeval with days ere"
1437,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Seddons was, and when a good four-post ""article"" was deemed worthy"
1438,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"of being a royal bequest. The bed itself, with all the appurtenances"
1439,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"of palliasse, mattresses, etc., was of far later date, and looked"
1440,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"most incongruously comfortable; the casements, too, with their little"
1441,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"diamond-shaped panes and iron binding, had given way to the modern"
1442,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,heterodoxy of the sash-window. Nor was this all that conspired to ruin
1443,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the costume, and render the room a meet haunt for such ""mixed spirits"""
1444,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,only as could condescend to don at the same time an Elizabethan doublet
1445,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,and Bond Street inexpressibles.

1447,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"With their green morocco slippers on a modern fender, in front of"

1449,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""shawl-pattern"" dressing gowns and black silk stocks, much at variance"
1450,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,with the high cane-backed chairs which supported them. A bunch of
1451,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"abomination, called a cigar, reeked in the left-hand corner of the"
1452,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"mouth of one, and in the right-hand corner of the mouth of the"
1453,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,other;--an arrangement happily adapted for the escape of the noxious
1454,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"fumes up the chimney, without that unmerciful ""funking"" each other,"
1455,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,which a less scientific disposition of the weed would have induced.
1456,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"A small pembroke table filled up the intervening space between them,"
1457,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"sustaining, at each extremity, an elbow and a glass of toddy;--thus in"
1458,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""lonely pensive contemplation"" were the two worthies occupied, when the"

1460,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1461,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Ghost-time's come!"" said Ingoldsby, taking from his waistcoat pocket a"

1465,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Hush!"" said Charles; ""did I not hear a footstep?"""

1469,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1470,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Tom darted across the room, threw open the door, and became aware of"
1471,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Mrs. Botherby toddling to her chamber, at the other end of the gallery,"
1472,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,after dosing one of the housemaids with an approved julep from the

1479,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"An hour--two--rolled on, and still no spectral visitation; nor did"

1484,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""This is all infernal nonsense, my good fellow. Deuce of any ghost"

1488,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1489,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Certainly.--Oh! thank'ee;--to be sure!"" stammered Charles, rousing"
1490,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"himself from a reverie, which had degenerated into an absolute snooze."
1491,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1492,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Good night, my boy! Bolt the door behind me; and defy the Pope, the"

1495,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Seaforth followed his friend's advice, and the next morning came down"
1496,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,to breakfast dressed in the habiliments of the preceding day. The charm
1497,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"was broken, the demon defeated; the light greys with the red stripe"
1498,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"down the seams were yet _in rerum naturâ_, and adorned the person of"

1500,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1501,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Tom felicitated himself and his partner of the watch on the result of
1502,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"their vigilance; but there is a rustic adage, which warns us against"

1514,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1515,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Well, Barney, what is it?"" quoth the sufferer, adopting the vernacular"

1527,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,

1541,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1542,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"This abrupt transition from ""lively to severe"" certainly took Maguire"

1575,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,your tricks here with impunity; recollect there is such a thing as a

1578,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Barney's eye flashed fire,--he stood erect, and was about to speak;"

1580,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,and left the room as perpendicular as a Quaker.

1584,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Ingoldsby,"" said Charles Seaforth, after breakfast, ""this is now past"
1585,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"a joke; to-day is the last of my stay; for, notwithstanding the ties"
1586,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"which detain me, common decency obliges me to visit home after so long"
1587,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,an absence. I shall come to an immediate explanation with your father
1588,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"on the subject nearest my heart, and depart while I have a change of"
1589,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,dress left. On his answer will my return depend! In the meantime tell
1590,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"me candidly,--I ask it in all seriousness, and as a friend,--am I not a"
1591,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"dupe to your well-known propensity to hoaxing? have you not a hand in--"""
1592,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1593,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""No, by heaven! Seaforth; I see what you mean: on my honour, I am as"
1594,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"much mystified as yourself; and if your servant--"""
1595,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1596,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Not he:--if there be a trick, he at least is not privy to it."""
1597,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1598,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""If there _be_ a trick? Why, Charles, do you think--"""
1599,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1600,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""I know not _what_ to think, Tom. As surely as you are a living man, so"
1601,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"surely did that spectral anatomy visit my room again last night, grin"
1602,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"in my face, and walk away with my trousers; nor was I able to spring"
1603,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"from my bed, or break the chain which seemed to bind me to my pillow."""
1604,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1605,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""Seaforth!"" said Ingoldsby, after a short pause, ""I will--But hush!"
1606,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"here are the girls and my father.--I will carry off the females, and"
1607,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"leave you a clear field with the governor: carry your point with him,"
1608,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"and we will talk about your breeches afterwards."""
1609,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1610,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Tom's diversion was successful; he carried off the ladies _en
1611,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,masse_ to look at a remarkable specimen of the class _Dodecandria
1612,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Monogynia_,--which they could not find;--while Seaforth marched boldly"
1613,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"up to the encounter, and carried ""the governor's"" outworks by a _coup"
1614,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,de main_. I shall not stop to describe the progress of the attack;
1615,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"suffice it that it was as successful as could have been wished, and"
1616,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,that Seaforth was referred back again to the lady. The happy lover was
1617,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,off at a tangent; the botanical party was soon overtaken; and the arm
1618,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"of Caroline, whom a vain endeavour to spell out the Linnæan name of a"
1619,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"daffy-down-dilly had detained a little in the rear of the others, was"
1620,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,soon firmly locked in his own.
1621,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1622,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""What was the world to them,"
1623,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Its noise, its nonsense, and its 'breeches' all?"""
1624,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1625,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Seaforth was in the seventh heaven; he retired to his room that night
1626,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"as happy as if no such thing as a goblin had ever been heard of, and"
1627,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,personal chattels were as well fenced in by law as real property. Not
1628,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"so Tom Ingoldsby: the mystery,--for mystery there evidently was,--had"
1629,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"not only piqued his curiosity, but ruffled his temper. The watch of"
1630,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the previous night had been unsuccessful, probably because it was"
1631,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"undisguised. To-night he would ""ensconce himself,""--not indeed ""behind"
1632,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the arras,""--for the little that remained was, as we have seen, nailed"
1633,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"to the wall,--but in a small closet which opened from one corner of"
1634,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the room, and, by leaving the door ajar, would give to its occupant"
1635,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,a view of all that might pass in the apartment. Here did the young
1636,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"ghost-hunter take up a position, with a good stout sapling under his"
1637,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"arm, a full half-hour before Seaforth retired for the night. Not even"
1638,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"his friend did he let into his confidence, fully determined that if his"
1639,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"plan did not succeed, the failure should be attributed to himself alone."
1640,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1641,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"At the usual hour of separation for the night, Tom saw, from his"
1642,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"concealment, the lieutenant enter his room, and, after taking a few"
1643,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"turns in it, with an expression so joyous as to betoken that his"
1644,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"thoughts were mainly occupied by his approaching happiness, proceed"
1645,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"slowly to disrobe himself. The coat, the waistcoat, the black silk"
1646,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"stock, were gradually discarded; the green morocco slippers were kicked"
1647,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"off, and then--ay, and then--his countenance grew grave; it seemed to"
1648,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"occur to him all at once that this was his last stake,--nay, that the"
1649,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"very breeches he had on were not his own,--that to-morrow morning was"
1650,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"his last, and that if he lost _them_--A glance showed that his mind was"
1651,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"made up; he replaced the single button he had just subducted, and threw"
1652,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"himself upon the bed in a state of transition,--half chrysalis, half"
1653,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,grub.
1654,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1655,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Wearily did Tom Ingoldsby watch the sleeper by the flickering light of
1656,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the night-lamp, till the clock, striking one, induced him to increase"
1657,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,the narrow opening which he had left for the purpose of observation.
1658,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"The motion, slight as it was, seemed to attract Charles's attention;"
1659,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"for he raised himself suddenly to a sitting posture, listened for a"
1660,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"moment, and then stood upright upon the floor. Ingoldsby was on the"
1661,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"point of discovering himself, when, the light, flashing full upon his"
1662,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"friend's countenance, he perceived that, though his eyes were open,"
1663,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""their sense was shut,""--that he was yet under the influence of sleep."
1664,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Seaforth advanced slowly to the toilet, lit his candle at the lamp that"
1665,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"stood on it, then, going back to the bed's foot, appeared to search"
1666,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,eagerly for something which he could not find. For a few moments he
1667,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"seemed restless and uneasy, walking round the apartment and examining"
1668,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the chairs, till, coming fully in front of a large swing-glass that"
1669,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"flanked the dressing-table, he paused, as if contemplating his figure"
1670,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"in it. He now returned towards the bed; put on his slippers, and,"
1671,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"with cautious and stealthy steps, proceeded towards the little arched"
1672,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,doorway that opened on the private staircase.
1673,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1674,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"As he drew the bolt, Tom Ingoldsby emerged from his hiding-place;"
1675,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"but the sleep-walker heard him not; he proceeded softly down stairs,"
1676,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,followed at a due distance by his friend; opened the door which led
1677,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,out upon the gardens; and stood at once among the thickest of the
1678,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"shrubs, which there clustered round the base of a corner turret, and"
1679,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,screened the postern from common observation. At this moment Ingoldsby
1680,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,had nearly spoiled all by making a false step: the sound attracted
1681,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Seaforth's attention,--he paused and turned; and as the full moon shed"
1682,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"her light directly upon his pale and troubled features, Tom marked,"
1683,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"almost with dismay, the fixed and rayless appearance of his eyes:--"
1684,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1685,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""There was no speculation in those orbs"
1686,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"That he did glare withal."""
1687,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1688,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,The perfect stillness preserved by his follower seemed to reassure
1689,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"him; he turned aside; and from the midst of a thickset laurustinus,"
1690,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"drew forth a gardener's spade, shouldering which he proceeded with"
1691,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,greater rapidity into the midst of the shrubbery. Arrived at a certain
1692,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"point where the earth seemed to have been recently disturbed, he"
1693,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"set himself heartily to the task of digging, till, having thrown up"
1694,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"several shovelfuls of mould, he stopped, flung down his tool, and very"
1695,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,composedly began to disencumber himself of his pantaloons.
1696,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1697,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Up to this moment Tom had watched him with a wary eye: he now advanced
1698,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"cautiously, and, as his friend was busily engaged in disentangling"
1699,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"himself from his garment, made himself master of the spade. Seaforth,"
1700,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"meanwhile, had accomplished his purpose: he stood for a moment with"
1701,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1702,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""His streamers waving in the wind,"""
1703,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1704,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,occupied in carefully rolling up the small-clothes into as compact
1705,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"a form as possible, and all heedless of the breath of heaven, which"
1706,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"might certainly be supposed, at such a moment, and in such a plight, to"
1707,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"""visit his frame too roughly."""
1708,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1709,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,He was in the act of stooping low to deposit the pantaloons in the
1710,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"grave which he had been digging for them, when Tom Ingoldsby came close"
1711,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"behind him, and with the flat side of the spade--"

1715,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,The shock was effectual;--never again was Lieutenant Seaforth known
1716,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"to act the part of a somnambulist. One by one, his breeches,--his"
1717,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"trousers,--his pantaloons,--his silk-net tights,--his patent"
1718,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"cords,--his showy greys with the broad red stripe of the Bombay"
1719,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Fencibles were brought to light,--rescued from the grave in which they"
1720,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"had been buried, like the strata of a Christmas pie; and, after having"
1721,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"been well aired by Mrs. Botherby, became once again effective."
1722,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1723,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"The family, the ladies especially, laughed;--the Peterses laughed;--the"

1727,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Charles Seaforth, unable to face the quizzing which awaited him on all"
1728,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"sides, started off two hours earlier than he had proposed:--he soon"
1729,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"returned, however; and having, at his father-in-law's request, given up"
1730,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the occupation of Rajah-hunting and shooting Nabobs, led his blushing"
1731,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,bride to the altar.
1732,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1733,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Mr. Simpkinson from Bath did not attend the ceremony, being engaged"
1734,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"at the Grand Junction Meeting of _Sçavans_, then congregating from"
1735,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"all parts of the known world in the city of Dublin. His essay,"
1736,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"demonstrating that the globe is a great custard, whipped into"
1737,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"coagulation by whirlwinds, and cooked by electricity,--a little too"
1738,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"much baked in the Isle of Portland, and a thought underdone about the"
1739,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"Bog of Allen,--was highly spoken of, and narrowly escaped obtaining a"
1740,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Bridgewater prize.
1741,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,
1742,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,Miss Simpkinson and her sister acted as bridesmaids on the occasion;
1743,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,"the former wrote an _epithalamium_, and the latter cried ""Lassy me!"" at"
1744,THE SPECTRE OF TAPPINGTON.,the clergyman's wig.--Some years have since rolled on; the union has

2489,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,it?--where had he been?--how had he got home?--all was a mystery!--he
2490,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"remembered ""a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;"" all was fog"
2491,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"and fantasy. What he could clearly recollect was, that he had dug"
2492,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"up the Grinning Sailor, and that the Saint had helped to throw him"
2493,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,into the river again. All was thenceforth wonderment and devotion.
2494,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Masses were sung, tapers were kindled, bells were tolled; the monks"
2495,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"of St. Romuald had a solemn procession, the abbot at their head, the"

2497,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,in the centre;--Father Fothergill brewed a XXX puncheon of holy water.
2498,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,The Rood of Gillingham was deserted; the chapel of Rainham forsaken;
2499,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"every one who had a soul to be saved, flocked with his offering to St."
2500,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Bridget's shrine, and Emmanuel Saddleton gathered more fees from the"
2501,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,promiscuous piety of that one week than he had pocketed during the
2502,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,twelve preceding months.
2503,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2504,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Meanwhile the corpse of the ejected reprobate oscillated like a
2505,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,pendulum between Sheerness and Gillingham Reach. Now borne by the
2506,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Medway into the Western Swale,--now carried by the refluent tide"
2507,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"back to the vicinity of its old quarters,--it seemed as though"
2508,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,the River god and Neptune were amusing themselves with a game of
2509,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"subaqueous battledore, and had chosen this unfortunate carcass as a"
2510,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,marine shuttlecock. For some time the alternation was kept up with
2511,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"great spirit, till Boreas, interfering in the shape of a stiffish"
2512,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Nor'-wester,"" drifted the bone (and flesh) of contention ashore on the"

2514,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"discovered by the retainers, and dragged from its oozy bed, grinning"
2515,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,worse than ever. Tidings of the god-send were of course carried
2516,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,instantly to the castle; for the Baron was a very great man; and if
2517,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"a dun cow had flown across his property unannounced by the warder,"
2518,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"the Baron would have kicked him, the said warder, from the topmost"
2519,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"battlement into the bottommost ditch,--a descent of peril, and one"
2520,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"which ""Ludwig the leaper,"" or the illustrious Trenck himself might well"

2571,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Sir Robert de Shurland, Lord of Shurland and Minster, Baron of Sheppey"
2572,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"_in comitatu_ Kent, was, as has been before hinted, a very great man."
2573,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"He was also a very little man; that is, he was relatively great,"
2574,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"and relatively little,--or physically little, and metaphorically"
2575,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"great,--like Sir Sidney Smith and the late Mr. Bonaparte. To the frame"

2583,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"bloodshot, and his nose _retroussé_ with a remarkably red tip. Strictly"
2584,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"speaking, the Baron could not be called handsome: but his _tout"
2585,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"ensemble_ was singularly impressive: and when he called for his boots,"

2603,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2604,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"The Baron's beard was peaked; and his mustaches, stiff and stumpy,"
2605,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"projected horizontally like those of a Tom Cat; he twirled the one,"
2606,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"he stroked the other, he drew the buckle of his surcingle a thought"
2607,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"tighter, and strode down the great staircase three steps at a stride."
2608,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2609,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,The vassals were assembled in the great hall of Shurland Castle; every
2610,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"cheek was pale, every tongue was mute: expectation and perplexity were"
2611,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,visible on every brow. What would his lordship do?--Were the recusant
2612,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"anybody else, gyves to the heels and hemp to the throat were but too"
2613,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"good for him:--but it was Father Fothergill who had said ""I won't;"" and"
2614,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"though the Baron was a very great man, the Pope was a greater, and the"
2615,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Pope was Father Fothergill's great friend--some people said he was his
2616,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,uncle.
2617,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2618,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Father Fothergill was busy in the refectory trying conclusions with a
2619,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"venison pasty, when he received the summons of his patron to attend him"
2620,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"in the chapel cemetery. Of course he lost no time in obeying it, for"
2621,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,obedience was the general rule in Shurland Castle. If anybody ever said
2622,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""I won't,"" it was the exception; and, like all other exceptions, only"
2623,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,proved the rule the stronger. The Father was a friar of the Augustine
2624,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"persuasion; a brotherhood which, having been planted in Kent some few"
2625,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"centuries earlier, had taken very kindly to the soil, and overspread"
2626,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,the county much as hops did some few centuries later. He was plump and
2627,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"portly, a little thick-winded, especially after dinner,--stood five"
2628,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"feet four in his sandals, and weighed hard upon eighteen stone. He was"
2629,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"moreover a personage of singular piety; and the iron girdle, which, he"
2630,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"said, he wore under his cassock to mortify withal, might have been well"
2631,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"mistaken for the tire of a cart-wheel.--When he arrived, Sir Robert was"
2632,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,pacing up and down by the side of a newly opened grave.
2633,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2634,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""_Benedicite!_ fair son,""--(the Baron was as brown as a"
2635,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"cigar,)--""_Benedicite!_"" said the Chaplain."
2636,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2637,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"The Baron was too angry to stand upon compliment. ""Bury me that"

2639,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2640,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""It may not be, fair son,"" said the Friar; ""he hath perished without"
2641,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"absolution."""
2642,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,

2647,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2648,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Bridget me no Bridgets!--do me thine office quickly, Sir Shaveling;"
2649,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"or, by the Piper that played before Moses--"" The oath was a fearful"
2650,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"one; and whenever the Baron swore to do mischief, he was never known"
2651,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"to perjure himself. He was playing with the hilt of his sword.--""Do me"
2652,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"thine office, I say. Give him his passport to Heaven!"""
2653,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2654,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""He is already gone to Hell!"" stammered the Friar."
2655,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2656,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Then do you go after him!"" thundered the Lord of Shurland."
2657,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2658,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"His sword half leaped from its scabbard. No!--the trenchant blade, that"
2659,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"had cut Suleiman Ben Malek Ben Buckskin from helmet to chine, disdained"
2660,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,to daub itself with the cerebellum of a miserable monk;--it leaped back
2661,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"again;--and as the Chaplain, scared at its flash, turned him in terror,"
2662,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,the Baron gave him a kick!--one kick!--it was but one!--but such a one!
2663,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Despite its obesity, up flew his holy body in an angle of forty-five"
2664,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"degrees; then, having reached its highest point of elevation, sunk"
2665,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,headlong into the open grave that yawned to receive it. If the reverend
2666,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"gentleman had possessed such a thing as a neck, he had infallibly"
2667,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"broken it; as he did not, he only dislocated his vertebræ,--but that"
2668,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,did quite as well. He was as dead as ditch-water!
2669,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2670,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""In with the other rascal!"" said the Baron,--and he was obeyed; for"
2671,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,there he stood in his boots. Mattock and shovel made short work of it;
2672,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,twenty feet of superincumbent mould pressed down alike the saint and
2673,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"the sinner. ""Now sing a requiem who list!"" said the Baron, and his"
2674,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,lordship went back to his oysters.
2675,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2676,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"The vassals at Castle Shurland were astounded, or, as the Seneschal"
2677,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Hugh better expressed it, ""perfectly conglomerated,"" by this event."
2678,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"What! murder a monk in the odour of sanctity,--and on consecrated"
2679,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,ground too!--They trembled for the health of the Baron's soul. To the
2680,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,unsophisticated many it seemed that matters could not have been much
2681,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,worse had he shot a bishop's coach-horse;--all looked for some signal
2682,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,judgment. The melancholy catastrophe of their neighbours at Canterbury
2683,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,was yet rife in their memories: not two centuries had elapsed since
2684,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,those miserable sinners had cut off the tail of the blessed St.
2685,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Thomas's mule. The tail of the mule, it was well known, had been"
2686,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,forthwith affixed to that of the Mayor; and rumour said it had since
2687,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,been hereditary in the corporation. The least that could be expected
2688,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"was, that Sir Robert should have a friar tacked on to his for the"
2689,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"term of his natural life! Some bolder spirits there were, 'tis true,"
2690,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"who viewed the matter in various lights, according to their different"
2691,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,temperaments and dispositions; for perfect unanimity existed not
2692,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"even in the good old times. The verderer, roistering Hob Roebuck, swore"
2693,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"roundly, ""'Twere as good a deed as eat to kick down the chapel as well"
2694,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"as the monk.""--Hob had stood there in a white sheet for kissing Giles"
2695,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Miller's daughter.--On the other hand, Simpkin Agnew, the bell-ringer,"
2696,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"doubted if the devil's cellar, which runs under the bottomless abyss,"
2697,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"were quite deep enough for the delinquent, and speculated on the"
2698,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,probability of a hole being dug in it for his especial accommodation.
2699,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"The philosophers and economists thought, with Saunders McBullock, the"
2700,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Baron's bagpiper, that ""a feckless monk more or less was nae great"
2701,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"subject for a clamjamphry,"" especially as ""the supply considerably"
2702,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"exceeded the demand;"" while Malthouse, the tapster, was arguing to Dame"
2703,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Martin that a murder now and then was a seasonable check to population,"
2704,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"without which the Isle of Sheppey would in time be devoured, like a"
2705,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"mouldy cheese, by inhabitants of its own producing.--Meanwhile, the"
2706,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Baron ate his oysters and thought no more of the matter.
2707,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2708,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,But this tranquillity of his lordship was not to last. A couple
2709,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,of Saints had been seriously offended; and we have all of us read
2710,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,at school that celestial minds are by no means insensible to the
2711,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,provocations of anger. There were those who expected that St. Bridget
2712,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"would come in person, and have the friar up again, as she did the"
2713,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,sailor; but perhaps her ladyship did not care to trust herself within
2714,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"the walls of Shurland Castle. To say the truth, it was scarcely a"
2715,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"decent house for a female Saint to be seen in. The Baron's gallantries,"
2716,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"since he became a widower, had been but too notorious; and her own"
2717,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,reputation was a little blown upon in the earlier days of her earthly
2718,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"pilgrimage: then things were so apt to be misrepresented: in short, she"
2719,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"would leave the whole affair to St. Austin, who, being a gentleman,"
2720,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"could interfere with propriety, avenge her affront as well as his own,"
2721,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,and leave no loop-hole for scandal. St. Austin himself seems to have
2722,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"had his scruples, though of their precise nature it would be difficult"
2723,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"to determine, for it were idle to suppose him at all afraid of the"
2724,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Baron's boots. Be this as it may, the mode which he adopted was at once"
2725,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"prudent and efficacious. As an ecclesiastic, he could not well call the"
2726,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Baron out,--had his boots been out of the question;--so he resolved"
2727,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"to have recourse to the law. Instead of Shurland Castle, therefore,"
2728,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"he repaired forthwith to his own magnificent monastery, situate just"
2729,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"within the walls of Canterbury, and presented himself in a vision to"
2730,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"its abbot. No one who has ever visited that ancient city, can fail"
2731,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,to recollect the splendid gateway which terminates the vista of St.
2732,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Paul's-street, and stands there yet in all its pristine beauty. The"
2733,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,tiny train of miniature artillery which now adorns its battlements
2734,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"is, it is true, an ornament of a later date; and is said to have been"
2735,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"added some centuries after by a learned but jealous proprietor, for"
2736,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,the purpose of shooting any wiser man than himself who might chance to
2737,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,come that way. Tradition is silent as to any discharge having taken
2738,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"place, nor can the oldest inhabitant of modern days recollect any such"
2739,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"occurrence.[4] Here it was, in a handsome chamber, immediately over the"
2740,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"lofty archway, that the Superior of the monastery lay buried in a brief"
2741,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,slumber snatched from his accustomed vigils. His mitre--for he was a
2742,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Mitred Abbot, and had a seat in parliament--rested on a table beside"
2743,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"him; near it stood a silver flagon of Gascony wine, ready, no doubt,"
2744,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,for the pious uses of the morrow. Fasting and watching had made him
2745,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"more than usually somnolent, than which nothing could have been better"
2746,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"for the purpose of the Saint, who now appeared to him radiant in all"
2747,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,the colours of the rainbow.

2814,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"murdered,--two friars--ten--twenty; a whole convent had been"
2815,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"assaulted,--sacked,--burnt,--all the monks had been killed, and all the"
2816,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,nuns had been kissed!--Murder!--fire!--sacrilege! Never was city in
2817,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"such an uproar. From St. George's gate to St. Dunstan's suburb, from"
2818,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"the Donjon to the borough of Staplegate, all was noise and hubbub."
2819,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Where was it?""--""When was it?""--""How was it?"" The Mayor caught up"
2820,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"his chain, the Aldermen donned their furred gowns, the Town-clerk put"
2821,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"on his spectacles. ""Who was he?""--""What was he?""--""Where was he?""--he"
2822,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"should be hanged,--he should be burned,--he should be broiled,--he"
2823,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"should be fried,--he should be scraped to death with red-hot"
2824,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"oyster-shells! ""Who was he?""--""What was his name?"""
2825,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2826,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"The Abbot's Apparitor drew forth his roll and read aloud:--""Sir Robert"
2827,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"de Shurland, Knight banneret, Baron of Shurland and Minster, and Lord"
2828,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"of Sheppey."""
2829,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2830,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"The Mayor put his chain in his pocket, the Aldermen took off their"
2831,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"gowns, the Town Clerk put his pen behind his ear.--It was a county"
2832,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,business altogether:--the Sheriff had better call out the _posse
2833,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,comitatus_.
2834,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2835,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"While saints and sinners were thus leaguing against him, the Baron de"
2836,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Shurland was quietly eating his breakfast. He had passed a tranquil
2837,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"night, undisturbed by dreams of cowl or capuchin; nor was his appetite"
2838,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"more affected than his conscience. On the contrary, he sat rather"
2839,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"longer over his meal than usual: luncheon-time came, and he was ready"
2840,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,as ever for his oysters: but scarcely had Dame Martin opened his first
2841,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,half-dozen when the warder's horn was heard from the barbican.
2842,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2843,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Who the devil's that?"" said Sir Robert. ""I'm not at home, Periwinkle."
2844,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"I hate to be disturbed at meals, and I won't be at home to anybody."""
2845,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2846,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""An't please your lordship,"" answered the Seneschal, ""Paul Prior hath"
2847,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"given notice that there is a body--"""
2848,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2849,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Another body!"" roared the Baron. ""Am I to be everlastingly plagued"
2850,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,with bodies? No time allowed me to swallow a morsel. Throw it into the

2852,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2853,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""So please you, my lord, it is a body of horse,--and--and Paul says"
2854,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"there is a still larger body of foot behind it; and he thinks, my"
2855,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"lord,--that is, he does not know, but he thinks--and we all think, my"
2856,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"lord, that they are coming to--to besiege the castle!"""
2857,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2858,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Besiege the castle! Who? What? What for?"""

2863,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"and Hever, and Leybourne, and Heaven knows how many more; and they are"

2866,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Periwinkle,"" said the Baron, ""up with the drawbridge; down with the"
2867,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"portcullis; bring me a cup of canary, and my nightcap. I won't be"
2868,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"bothered with them. I shall go to bed."""
2869,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2870,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""To bed, my lord?"" cried Periwinkle, with a look that seemed to say,"
2871,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""He's crazy!"""
2872,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2873,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,At this moment the shrill tones of a trumpet were heard to sound thrice
2874,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,from the champaign. It was the signal for parley: the Baron changed his
2875,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"mind; instead of going to bed, he went to the ramparts."
2876,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2877,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Well, rapscallions! and what now!"" said the Baron."
2878,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2879,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"A herald, two pursuivants, and a trumpeter, occupied the foreground"
2880,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"of the scene; behind them, some three hundred paces off, upon a"
2881,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"rising ground, was drawn up in battle array the main body of the"
2882,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,ecclesiastical forces.
2883,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2884,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Hear you, Robert de Shurland, Knight, Baron of Shurland and Minster,"
2885,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"and Lord of Sheppey, and know all men, by these presents, that I do"
2886,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"hereby attach you, the said Robert, of murder and sacrilege, now, or of"
2887,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"late, done and committed by you, the said Robert, contrary to the peace"
2888,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"of our Sovereign Lord the King, his crown and dignity: and I do hereby"
2889,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"require and charge you, the said Robert, to forthwith surrender and"

2895,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,

2897,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2898,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""His _posse comitatus_, and--"""
2899,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2900,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Go to Bath!"" said the Baron."
2901,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2902,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,A defiance so contemptuous roused the ire of the adverse commanders.
2903,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,A volley of missiles rattled about the Baron's ears. Nightcaps avail
2904,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"little against contusions. He left the walls, and returned to the great"
2905,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,hall.
2906,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2907,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Let them pelt away,"" quoth the Baron; ""there are no windows to break,"
2908,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"and they can't get in.""--So he took his afternoon nap, and the siege"
2909,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,went on.
2910,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2911,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Towards evening his lordship awoke, and grew tired of the din. Guy"
2912,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Pearson, too, had got a black eye from a brick-bat, and the assailants"
2913,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,were clambering over the outer wall. So the Baron called for his
2914,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Sunday hauberk of Milan steel, and his great two-handed sword with the"
2915,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,terrible name;--it was the fashion in feudal times to give names to
2916,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,swords: King Arthur's was christened Excalibar; the Baron called his
2917,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Tickletoby, and whenever he took it in hand it was no joke."
2918,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2919,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Up with the portcullis! down with the bridge!"" said Sir Robert; and"
2920,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"out he sallied, followed by the _élite_ of his retainers. Then there"
2921,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,was a pretty to-do. Heads flew one way--arms and legs another; round
2922,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"went Tickletoby; and, wherever it alighted, down came horse and man:"
2923,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,the Baron excelled himself that day. All that he had done in Palestine
2924,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"faded in the comparison; he had fought for fun there, but now it was"
2925,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,for life and lands. Away went John de Northwood; away went William
2926,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"of Hever, and Roger of Leybourne.--Hamo de Crevecœur, with the church"
2927,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"vassals and the banner of St. Austin, had been gone some time.--The"
2928,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"siege was raised, and the Lord of Sheppey was left alone in his glory."
2929,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2930,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"But, brave as the Baron undoubtedly was, and total as had been the"
2931,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"defeat of his enemies, it cannot be supposed that _La Stoccata_ would"
2932,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,be allowed to carry it away thus. It has before been hinted that Abbot
2933,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Anselm had written to the Pope, and Boniface the Eighth piqued himself"
2934,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,on his punctuality as a correspondent in all matters connected with
2935,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,church discipline. He sent back an answer by return of post; and by it
2936,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,all Christian people were strictly enjoined to aid in exterminating the
2937,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"offender, on pain of the greater excommunication in this world, and a"
2938,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"million of years of purgatory in the next. But then, again, Boniface"
2939,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,the Eighth was rather at a discount in England just then. He had
2940,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"affronted Longshanks, as the loyal lieges had nicknamed their monarch;"
2941,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,and Longshanks had been rather sharp upon the clergy in consequence. If
2942,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"the Baron de Shurland could but get the King's pardon for what, in his"
2943,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"cooler moments, he admitted to be a peccadillo, he might sniff at the"
2944,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Pope, and bid him ""do his devilmost."""
2945,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2946,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Fortune, who, as the poet says, delights to favour the bold, stood his"
2947,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"friend on this occasion. Edward had been, for some time, collecting a"
2948,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"large force on the coast of Kent, to carry on his French wars for the"
2949,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,recovery of Guienne; he was expected shortly to review it in person;
2950,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"but, then, the troops lay principally in cantonments about the mouth of"
2951,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"the Thames, and his Majesty was to come down by water. What was to be"
2952,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"done?--the royal barge was in sight, and John de Northwood and Hamo de"
2953,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Crevecœur had broken up all the boats to boil their camp-kettles.--A
2954,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,truly great mind is never without resources.
2955,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2956,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Bring me my boots!"" said the Baron."
2957,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2958,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"They brought him his boots, and his dapple-grey steed along with them."
2959,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Such a courser! all blood and bone, short-backed, broad-chested,"
2960,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"and,--but that he was a little ewe-necked,--faultless in form and"
2961,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"figure. The Baron sprang upon his back, and dashed at once into the"
2962,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,river.
2963,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2964,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,The barge which carried Edward Longshanks and his fortunes had by this
2965,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,time nearly reached the Nore; the stream was broad and the current
2966,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"strong, but Sir Robert and his steed were almost as broad, and a great"
2967,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,deal stronger. After breasting the tide gallantly for a couple of
2968,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"miles, the Knight was near enough to hail the steersman."
2969,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2970,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""What have we got here?"" said the King.--""It's a mermaid,"" said"
2971,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"one.--""It's a grampus,"" said another.--""It's the devil,"" said a"
2972,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,third.--But they were all wrong; it was only Robert de Shurland.
2973,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Grammercy,"" quoth the King, ""that fellow was never born to be drowned!"""
2974,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2975,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,It has been said before that the Baron had fought in the Holy wars; in
2976,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"fact, he had accompanied Longshanks, when only heir apparent, in his"
2977,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"expedition twenty-five years before, although his name is unaccountably"
2978,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,omitted by Sir Harris Nicolas in his list of crusaders. He had been
2979,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,present at Acre when Amirand of Joppa stabbed the prince with a
2980,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"poisoned dagger, and had lent Princess Eleanor his own tooth-brush"
2981,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,after she had sucked out the venom from the wound.--He had slain
2982,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"certain Saracens, contented himself with his own plunder, and never"
2983,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,dunned the commissariat for arrears of pay.--Of course he ranked high
2984,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"in Edward's good graces, and had received the honour of knighthood at"
2985,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,his hands on the field of battle.
2986,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2987,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,In one so circumstanced it cannot be supposed that such a trifle as the
2988,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"killing of a frowzy friar would be much resented, even had he not taken"
2989,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"so bold a measure to obtain his pardon. His petition was granted, of"
2990,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"course, as soon as asked; and so it would have been had the indictment"
2991,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"drawn up by the Canterbury town-clerk, viz., ""That he the said Robert"
2992,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"de Shurland, etc., had then and there, with several, to wit, one"
2993,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"thousand, pairs of boots, given sundry, to wit, two thousand, kicks,"
2994,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"and therewith and thereby killed divers, to wit, ten thousand, Austin"
2995,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"friars,"" been true to the letter."
2996,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
2997,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Thrice did the gallant grey circumnavigate the barge, while Robert"
2998,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"de Winchelsey, the chancellor, and archbishop to boot, was making"
2999,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"out, albeit with great reluctance, the royal pardon. The interval was"
3000,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"sufficiently long to enable His Majesty, who, gracious as he was, had"
3001,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"always an eye to business, just to hint that the gratitude he felt"
3002,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,towards the Baron was not unmixed with a lively sense of services to
3003,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"come; and that, if life were now spared him, common decency must oblige"
3004,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"him to make himself useful. Before the archbishop, who had scalded"
3005,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"his fingers with the wax in affixing the great seal, had time to take"
3006,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"them out of his mouth, all was settled, and the Baron de Shurland had"
3007,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"pledged himself to be forthwith in readiness, _cum suis_, to accompany"
3008,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,his liege lord to Guienne.
3009,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3010,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"With the royal pardon secured in his vest, boldly did his lordship turn"
3011,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,again to the shore; and as boldly did his courser oppose his breadth of
3012,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,chest to the stream. It was a work of no common difficulty or danger;
3013,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"a steed of less ""mettle and bone"" had long since sunk in the effort:"
3014,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"as it was, the Baron's boots were full of water, and Grey Dolphin's"
3015,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,chamfrain more than once dipped beneath the wave. The convulsive snorts
3016,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,of the noble animal shewed his distress; each instant they became more
3017,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"loud and frequent; when his hoof touched the strand, and ""the horse and"
3018,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"his rider"" stood once again in safety on the shore."
3019,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3020,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Rapidly dismounting, the Baron was loosening the girths of his"
3021,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"demi-pique, to give the panting animal breath, when he was aware of"
3022,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"as ugly an old woman as he had ever clapped eyes upon, peeping at him"
3023,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,under the horse's belly.
3024,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3025,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""Make much of your steed, Robert Shurland! Make much of your steed!"""
3026,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"cried the hag, shaking at him her long and bony finger. ""Groom to the"
3027,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"hide, and corn to the manger! He has saved your life, Robert Shurland,"
3028,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"for the nonce; but he shall yet be the means of your losing it, for all"
3029,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"that!"""
3030,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3031,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"The Baron started: ""What's that you say, you old faggot?""--He ran round"
3032,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,by his horse's tail;--the woman was gone!
3033,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3034,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,The Baron paused; his great soul was not to be shaken by trifles; he
3035,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"looked around him, and solemnly ejaculated the word ""Humbug!""--then"
3036,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"slinging the bridle across his arm, walked slowly on in the direction"
3037,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,of the castle.
3038,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3039,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"The appearance, and still more the disappearance, of the crone,"
3040,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,had however made an impression; every step he took he became more
3041,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"thoughtful. ""'Twould be deuced provoking, though, if he _should_"
3042,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"break my neck after all.""--He turned and gazed at Dolphin with the"
3043,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"scrutinizing eye of a veterinary surgeon.--""I'll be shot if he is not"
3044,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"groggy!"" said the Baron."
3045,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3046,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"With his lordship, like another great Commander, ""Once to be in doubt,"
3047,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"was once to be resolved:"" it would never do to go to the wars on a"
3048,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"rickety prad. He dropped the rein, drew forth Tickletoby, and, as the"
3049,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"enfranchised Dolphin, good easy horse, stretched out his ewe-neck to"
3050,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"the herbage, struck off his head at a single blow. ""There, you lying"
3051,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"old beldame!"" said the Baron, ""now take him away to the knacker's."""

3054,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3055,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Three years were come and gone. King Edward's French wars were over;
3056,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"both parties, having fought till they came to a standstill, shook"
3057,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"hands; and the quarrel, as usual, was patched up by a royal marriage."
3058,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,This happy event gave his Majesty leisure to turn his attention to
3059,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Scotland, where things, through the intervention of William Wallace,"
3060,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,were looking rather queerish. As his reconciliation with Philip now
3061,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"allowed of his fighting the Scotch in peace and quietness, the monarch"
3062,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"lost no time in marching his long legs across the border, and the short"
3063,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"ones of the Baron followed him of course. At Falkirk, Tickletoby was in"
3064,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"great request; and in the year following, we find a contemporary poet"
3065,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"hinting at his master's prowess under the walls of Caerlaverock,"
3066,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3067,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Ovec eus fu achiminez

3078,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3079,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"So thoroughly awake, indeed, does he seem to have proved himself, that"
3080,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"the bard subsequently exclaims, in an ecstasy of admiration,"
3081,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3082,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Si ie estoie une pucelette
3083,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Je li donrie ceur et cors
3084,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Tant est de lu bons li recors.

3086,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""If I were a young maiden,"
3087,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"I would give my heart and person,"
3088,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"So great is his fame!"""
3089,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3090,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Fortunately the poet was a tough old monk of Exeter; since such a
3091,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"present to a nobleman, now in his grand climacteric, would hardly have"
3092,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,been worth the carriage. With the reduction of this stronghold of the
3093,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Maxwells seem to have concluded the Baron's military services; as on
3094,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,the very first day of the fourteenth century we find him once more
3095,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"landed on his native shore, and marching, with such of his retainers"
3096,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"as the wars had left him, towards the hospitable shelter of Shurland"
3097,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Castle. It was then, upon that very beach, some hundred yards distant"
3098,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"from high-water mark, that his eye fell upon something like an ugly"
3099,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,old woman in a red cloak! She was seated on what seemed to be a large
3100,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"stone, in an interesting attitude, with her elbows resting upon her"
3101,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"knees, and her chin upon her thumbs. The Baron started: the remembrance"
3102,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,of his interview with a similar personage in the same place some three
3103,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"years since, flashed upon his recollection. He rushed towards the spot,"
3104,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,but the form was gone;--nothing remained but the seat it had appeared
3105,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"to occupy. This, on examination, turned out to be no stone, but the"
3106,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,whitened skull of a dead horse!--A tender remembrance of the deceased
3107,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Grey Dolphin shot a momentary pang into the Baron's bosom; he drew the
3108,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,back of his hand across his face; the thought of the hag's prediction
3109,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"in an instant rose, and banished all softer emotions. In utter contempt"
3110,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"of his own weakness, yet with a tremor that deprived his redoubtable"
3111,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"kick of half its wonted force, he spurned the relic with his foot. One"
3112,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"word alone issued from his lips, elucidatory of what was passing in"
3113,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"his mind,--it long remained imprinted on the memory of his faithful"
3114,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"followers,--that word was ""Gammon!"" The skull bounded across the beach"
3115,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"till it reached the very margin of the stream;--one instant more, and"
3116,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"it would be engulfed for ever. At that moment a loud ""Ha! ha! ha!"" was"
3117,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,distinctly heard by the whole train to issue from its bleached and
3118,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,toothless jaws; it sank beneath the flood in a horse laugh!
3119,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3120,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,Meanwhile Sir Robert de Shurland felt an odd sort of sensation in his
3121,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,right foot. His boots had suffered in the wars. Great pains had been
3122,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"taken for their preservation. They had been ""soled"" and ""heeled"" more"
3123,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"than once;--had they been ""goloshed,"" their owner might have defied"
3124,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Fate! Well has it been said that ""there is no such thing as a trifle."""
3125,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,A nobleman's life depended upon a question of ninepence.
3126,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3127,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,The Baron marched on; the uneasiness in his foot increased. He plucked
3128,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,off his boot;--a horse's tooth was sticking in his great toe!
3129,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3130,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"The result may be anticipated. Lame as he was, his lordship, with"
3131,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"characteristic decision, would hobble on to Shurland; his walk"
3132,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,increased the inflammation; a flagon of _aqua vitæ_ did not mend
3133,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,matters. He was in a high fever; he took to his bed. Next morning the
3134,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,toe presented the appearance of a Bedfordshire carrot; by dinner-time
3135,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"it had deepened to beet-root; and when Bargrave, the leech, at last"
3136,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"sliced it off, the gangrene was too confirmed to admit of remedy. Dame"
3137,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Martin thought it high time to send for Miss Margaret, who, ever since"
3138,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"her mother's death, had been living with her maternal aunt, the abbess,"
3139,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"in the Ursuline convent at Greenwich. The young lady came, and with"
3140,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"her came one Master Ingoldsby, her cousin-german by the mother's side;"
3141,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,but the Baron was too far gone in the dead-thraw to recognise either.
3142,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"He died as he lived, unconquered and unconquerable. His last words"
3143,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"were--""Tell the old hag she may go to----."" Whither remains a secret."
3144,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,He expired without fully articulating the place of her destination.
3145,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3146,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"But who and what _was_ the crone who prophesied the catastrophe? Ay,"
3147,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"""that is the mystery of this wonderful history.""--Some say it was Dame"
3148,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Fothergill, the late confessor's mamma; others, St. Bridget herself;"
3149,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"others thought it was nobody at all, but only a phantom conjured up by"
3150,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"conscience. As we do not know, we decline giving an opinion."
3151,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3152,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,And what became of the Clerk of Chatham?--Mr. Simpkinson avers that he
3153,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"lived to a good old age, and was at last hanged by Jack Cade, with his"
3154,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"inkhorn about his neck, for ""setting boys copies."" In support of this"
3155,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"he adduces his name ""Emmanuel,"" and refers to the historian Shakspear."
3156,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Mr. Peters, on the contrary, considers this to be what he calls one of"
3157,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Mr. Simpkinson's ""Anacreonisms,"" inasmuch as, at the introduction of"
3158,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Mr. Cade's reform measure, the Clerk, if alive, would have been hard"
3159,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"upon two hundred years old. The probability is, that the unfortunate"
3160,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,alluded to was his great-grandson.
3161,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3162,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Margaret Shurland in due course became Margaret Ingoldsby, her portrait"
3163,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"still hangs in the gallery at Tappington. The features are handsome,"
3164,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"but shrewish, betraying, as it were, a touch of the old Baron's"
3165,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,temperament; but we never could learn that she actually kicked her
3166,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"husband. She brought him a very pretty fortune in chains, owches, and"
3167,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Saracen ear-rings; the barony, being a male fief, reverted to the Crown."
3168,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,
3169,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,In the abbey-church at Minster may yet be seen the tomb of a recumbent
3170,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"warrior, clad in the chain-mail of the 13th century.[5] His hands are"
3171,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"clasped in prayer; his legs, crossed in that position so prized by"
3172,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"Templars in ancient, and tailors in modern days, bespeak him a soldier"
3173,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,of the faith in Palestine. Close behind his dexter calf lies sculptured
3174,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"in bold relief a horse's head; and a respectable elderly lady, as she"
3175,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"shows the monument, fails not to read her auditors a fine moral lesson"
3176,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"on the sin of ingratitude, or to claim a sympathising tear to the"
3177,A LEGEND OF SHEPPEY.,"memory of poor ""Grey Dolphin!"""

3214,THE GHOST.,
3215,THE GHOST.,
3216,THE GHOST.,"There stands a City,--neither large nor small,"
3217,THE GHOST.,Its air and situation sweet and pretty;
3218,THE GHOST.,It matters very little--if at all--
3219,THE GHOST.,"Whether its denizens are dull or witty,"
3220,THE GHOST.,"Whether the ladies there are short or tall,"
3221,THE GHOST.,"Brunettes or blondes, only, there stands a city!--"
3222,THE GHOST.,Perhaps 'tis also requisite to minute
3223,THE GHOST.,That there's a Castle and a Cobbler in it.
3224,THE GHOST.,
3225,THE GHOST.,"A fair Cathedral, too, the story goes,"
3226,THE GHOST.,And kings and heroes lie entomb'd within her;
3227,THE GHOST.,"There pious Saints, in marble pomp repose,"
3228,THE GHOST.,Whose shrines are worn by knees of many a Sinner;
3229,THE GHOST.,"There, too, full many an Aldermanic nose"
3230,THE GHOST.,Roll'd its loud diapason after dinner;
3231,THE GHOST.,"And there stood high the holy sconce of Becket,"
3232,THE GHOST.,--Till four assassins came from France to crack it.
3233,THE GHOST.,
3234,THE GHOST.,"The Castle was a huge and antique mound,"
3235,THE GHOST.,"Proof against all th' artillery of the quiver,"
3236,THE GHOST.,"Ere those abominable guns were found,"
3237,THE GHOST.,To send cold lead through gallant warrior's liver.
3238,THE GHOST.,"It stands upon a gently rising ground,"
3239,THE GHOST.,"Sloping down gradually to the river,"
3240,THE GHOST.,Resembling (to compare great things with smaller)
3241,THE GHOST.,"A well-scooped, mouldy Stilton cheese,--but taller."
3242,THE GHOST.,
3243,THE GHOST.,"The keep, I find, 's been sadly alter'd lately,"
3244,THE GHOST.,"And, 'stead of mail-clad knights, of honour jealous,"
3245,THE GHOST.,"In martial panoply so grand and stately,"
3246,THE GHOST.,"Its walls are filled with money-making fellows,"
3247,THE GHOST.,"And stuff'd, unless I'm misinformed greatly,"
3248,THE GHOST.,"With leaden pipes, and coke, and coals, and bellows;"
3249,THE GHOST.,"In short, so great a change has come to pass,"
3250,THE GHOST.,'Tis now a manufactory of Gas.
3251,THE GHOST.,
3252,THE GHOST.,"But to my tale.--Before this profanation,"
3253,THE GHOST.,"And ere its ancient glories were cut short all,"
3254,THE GHOST.,A poor hard-working Cobbler took his station
3255,THE GHOST.,"In a small house, just opposite the portal;"
3256,THE GHOST.,"His birth, his parentage, and education,"
3257,THE GHOST.,"I know but little of--a strange, odd mortal;"
3258,THE GHOST.,"His aspect, air, and gait, were all ridiculous;"
3259,THE GHOST.,His name was Mason--he'd been christened Nicholas.
3260,THE GHOST.,
3261,THE GHOST.,"Nick had a wife possessed of many a charm,"
3262,THE GHOST.,And of the Lady Huntingdon persuasion;
3263,THE GHOST.,"But, spite of all her piety, her arm"
3264,THE GHOST.,She'd sometimes exercise when in a passion;
3265,THE GHOST.,"And, being of a temper somewhat warm,"
3266,THE GHOST.,"Would now and then seize, upon small occasion,"
3267,THE GHOST.,"A stick, or stool, or anything that round did lie,"
3268,THE GHOST.,And baste her lord and master most confoundedly.
3269,THE GHOST.,
3270,THE GHOST.,"No matter!--'tis a thing that's not uncommon,"
3271,THE GHOST.,"'Tis what we all have heard, and most have read of,--"
3272,THE GHOST.,"I mean, a bruizing, pugilistic woman,"
3273,THE GHOST.,"Such as I own I entertain a dread of,"
3274,THE GHOST.,"--And so did Nick,--whom sometimes there would come on"
3275,THE GHOST.,"A sort of fear his Spouse might knock his head off,"
3276,THE GHOST.,"Demolish half his teeth, or drive a rib in,"
3277,THE GHOST.,"She shone so much in ""facers"" and in ""fibbing."""
3278,THE GHOST.,
3279,THE GHOST.,"""There's time and place for all things,"" said a sage,"
3280,THE GHOST.,"(King Solomon, I think,) and this I can say,"
3281,THE GHOST.,"Within a well-roped ring, or on a stage,"
3282,THE GHOST.,"Boxing may be a very pretty _Fancy_,"
3283,THE GHOST.,When Messrs. Burke or Bendigo engage;
3284,THE GHOST.,"--'Tis not so well in Susan, Jane, or Nancy:--"
3285,THE GHOST.,"To get well mill'd by any one's an evil,"
3286,THE GHOST.,But by a lady--'tis the very Devil.
3287,THE GHOST.,
3288,THE GHOST.,"And so thought Nicholas, whose only trouble,"
3289,THE GHOST.,"(At least his worst,) was this his rib's propensity,"
3290,THE GHOST.,"For sometimes from the alehouse he would hobble,"
3291,THE GHOST.,His senses lost in a sublime immensity
3292,THE GHOST.,Of cogitation--then he couldn't cobble--
3293,THE GHOST.,And then his wife would often try the density
3294,THE GHOST.,"Of his poor skull, and strike with all her might,"
3295,THE GHOST.,As fast as kitchen-wenches strike a light.
3296,THE GHOST.,
3297,THE GHOST.,"Mason, meek soul, who ever hated strife,"
3298,THE GHOST.,"Of this same striking had a morbid dread,"
3299,THE GHOST.,He hated it like poison--or his wife.
3300,THE GHOST.,A vast antipathy!--but so he said
3301,THE GHOST.,"And very often, for a quiet life,"
3302,THE GHOST.,"On these occasions he'd sneak up to bed,"
3303,THE GHOST.,"Grope darkling in, and, soon as at the door"
3304,THE GHOST.,He heard his lady--he'd pretend to snore.
3305,THE GHOST.,
3306,THE GHOST.,"One night, then, ever partial to society,"
3307,THE GHOST.,"Nick, with a friend (another jovial fellow),"
3308,THE GHOST.,Went to a Club--I should have said Society--
3309,THE GHOST.,"At the ""City Arms,"" once call'd the Porto Bello;"
3310,THE GHOST.,"A Spouting party, which, though some decry it, I"
3311,THE GHOST.,Consider no bad lounge when one is mellow;
3312,THE GHOST.,"There they discuss the tax on salt, and leather,"
3313,THE GHOST.,And change of ministers and change of weather.
3314,THE GHOST.,
3315,THE GHOST.,"In short, it was a kind of British Forum,"
3316,THE GHOST.,"Like John Gale Jones's, erst in Piccadilly,"
3317,THE GHOST.,"Only they managed things with more decorum,"
3318,THE GHOST.,And the Orations were not _quite_ so silly;
3319,THE GHOST.,"Far different questions, too, would come before 'em,"
3320,THE GHOST.,"Not always Politics, which, will ye nill ye,"
3321,THE GHOST.,"Their London prototypes were always willing,"
3322,THE GHOST.,To give one _quantum suff._ of--for a shilling.
3323,THE GHOST.,
3324,THE GHOST.,"It more resembled one of later date,"
3325,THE GHOST.,"And tenfold talent, as I'm told in Bow Street,"
3326,THE GHOST.,"Where kindlier natured souls do congregate,"
3327,THE GHOST.,"And, though there are who deem that same a low street,"
3328,THE GHOST.,"Yet, I'm assured, for frolicsome debate"
3329,THE GHOST.,"And genuine humour it's surpassed by no street,"
3330,THE GHOST.,"When the ""Chief Baron"" enters, and assumes"
3331,THE GHOST.,"To ""rule"" o'er mimic ""Thesigers"" and ""Broughams."""
3332,THE GHOST.,
3333,THE GHOST.,"Here they would oft forget their Ruler's faults,"
3334,THE GHOST.,"And waste in ancient lore the midnight taper,"
3335,THE GHOST.,"Inquire if Orpheus first produced the Waltz,"
3336,THE GHOST.,"How Gas-lights differ from the Delphic Vapour,"
3337,THE GHOST.,"Whether Hippocrates gave Glauber's Salts,"
3338,THE GHOST.,And what the Romans wrote on ere they'd paper;--
3339,THE GHOST.,This night the subject of their disquisitions
3340,THE GHOST.,"Was Ghosts, Hobgoblins, Sprites, and Apparitions."
3341,THE GHOST.,
3342,THE GHOST.,"One learned gentleman, ""a sage grave man,"""
3343,THE GHOST.,"Talk'd of the Ghost in Hamlet, ""sheath'd in steel;""--"
3344,THE GHOST.,"His well-read friend, who next to speak began,"
3345,THE GHOST.,"Said, ""That was Poetry, and nothing real;"""
3346,THE GHOST.,"A third, of more extensive learning, ran"
3347,THE GHOST.,"To Sir George Villiers' Ghost, and Mrs. Veal;"
3348,THE GHOST.,"Of sheeted Spectres spoke with shorten'd breath,"
3349,THE GHOST.,"And thrice he quoted ""Drelincourt on Death."""
3350,THE GHOST.,
3351,THE GHOST.,"Nick smoked, and smoked, and trembled as he heard"
3352,THE GHOST.,"The point discuss'd, and all they said upon it,"
3353,THE GHOST.,"How, frequently, some murder'd man appear'd,"
3354,THE GHOST.,To tell his wife and children who had done it;
3355,THE GHOST.,"Or how a Miser's ghost, with grisly beard,"
3356,THE GHOST.,"And pale lean visage, in an old Scotch bonnet,"
3357,THE GHOST.,Wander'd about to watch his buried money!
3358,THE GHOST.,"When all at once Nick heard the clock strike One,--he"
3359,THE GHOST.,
3360,THE GHOST.,"Sprang from his seat, not doubting but a lecture"
3361,THE GHOST.,Impended from his fond and faithful She;
3362,THE GHOST.,"Nor could he well to pardon him expect her,"
3363,THE GHOST.,"For he had promised to ""be home to tea;"""
3364,THE GHOST.,"But having luckily the key o' the back door,"
3365,THE GHOST.,"He fondly hoped that, unperceived, he"
3366,THE GHOST.,"Might creep up stairs again, pretend to doze,"
3367,THE GHOST.,And hoax his spouse with music from his nose.
3368,THE GHOST.,
3369,THE GHOST.,Vain fruitless hope!--The wearied sentinel
3370,THE GHOST.,"At eve may overlook the crouching foe,"
3371,THE GHOST.,"Till, ere his hand can sound the alarum-bell,"
3372,THE GHOST.,He sinks beneath the unexpected blow;
3373,THE GHOST.,"Before the whiskers of Grimalkin fell,"
3374,THE GHOST.,"When slumb'ring on her post, the mouse may go;--"
3375,THE GHOST.,"But woman, wakeful woman, 's never weary,"
3376,THE GHOST.,"--Above all, when she waits to thump her deary."
3377,THE GHOST.,
3378,THE GHOST.,Soon Mrs. Mason heard the well-known tread;
3379,THE GHOST.,"She heard the key slow creaking in the door,"
3380,THE GHOST.,"Spied, through the gloom obscure, towards the bed"
3381,THE GHOST.,"Nick creeping soft, as oft he had crept before;"
3382,THE GHOST.,"When, bang, she threw a something at his head,"
3383,THE GHOST.,And Nick at once lay prostrate on the floor;
3384,THE GHOST.,"While she exclaim'd with her indignant face on,--"
3385,THE GHOST.,"""How dare you use your wife so, Mr. Mason?"""
3386,THE GHOST.,
3387,THE GHOST.,"Spare we to tell how fiercely she debated,"
3388,THE GHOST.,"Especially the length of her oration,--"
3389,THE GHOST.,"Spare we to tell how Nick expostulated,"
3390,THE GHOST.,"Roused by the bump into a good set passion,"
3391,THE GHOST.,"So great, that more than once he execrated,"
3392,THE GHOST.,Ere he crawl'd into bed in his usual fashion;
3393,THE GHOST.,"--The Muses hate brawls; suffice it then to say,"
3394,THE GHOST.,He duck'd below the clothes--and there he lay!
3395,THE GHOST.,
3396,THE GHOST.,"'Twas now the very witching time of night,"
3397,THE GHOST.,"When churchyards groan, and graves give up their dead,"
3398,THE GHOST.,"And many a mischievous, enfranchised Sprite"
3399,THE GHOST.,"Had long since burst his bonds of stone or lead,"
3400,THE GHOST.,"And hurried off, with schoolboy-like delight,"
3401,THE GHOST.,"To play his pranks near some poor wretch's bed,"
3402,THE GHOST.,"Sleeping perhaps serenely as a porpoise,"
3403,THE GHOST.,Nor dreaming of this fiendish Habeas Corpus.
3404,THE GHOST.,
3405,THE GHOST.,"Not so our Nicholas, his meditations"
3406,THE GHOST.,"Still to the same tremendous theme recurred,"
3407,THE GHOST.,"The same dread subject of the dark narrations,"
3408,THE GHOST.,"Which, back'd with such authority, he'd heard;"
3409,THE GHOST.,"Lost in his own horrific contemplations,"
3410,THE GHOST.,He ponder'd o'er each well-remember'd word;
3411,THE GHOST.,"When at the bed's foot, close beside the post,"
3412,THE GHOST.,He verily believed he saw--a Ghost!
3413,THE GHOST.,
3414,THE GHOST.,Plain and more plain the unsubstantial Sprite
3415,THE GHOST.,To his astonish'd gaze each moment grew;
3416,THE GHOST.,"Ghastly and gaunt, it rear'd its shadowy height,"
3417,THE GHOST.,"Of more than mortal seeming to the view,"
3418,THE GHOST.,"And round its long, thin, bony fingers drew"
3419,THE GHOST.,"A tatter'd winding-sheet, of course _all white_;--"
3420,THE GHOST.,"The moon that moment peeping through a cloud,"
3421,THE GHOST.,Nick very plainly saw it _through the shroud_!
3422,THE GHOST.,
3423,THE GHOST.,"And now those matted locks, which never yet"
3424,THE GHOST.,"Had yielded to the comb's unkind divorce,"
3425,THE GHOST.,"Their long-contracted amity forget,"
3426,THE GHOST.,And spring asunder with elastic force;
3427,THE GHOST.,"Nay, e'en the very cap, of texture coarse,"
3428,THE GHOST.,"Whose ruby cincture crown'd that brow of jet,"
3429,THE GHOST.,Uprose in agony--the Gorgon's head
3430,THE GHOST.,Was but a type of Nick's up-squatting in the bed.
3431,THE GHOST.,
3432,THE GHOST.,"From every pore distill'd a clammy dew,"
3433,THE GHOST.,"Quaked every limb,--the candle too no doubt,"
3434,THE GHOST.,"_En règle_, _would_ have burnt extremely blue,"
3435,THE GHOST.,But Nick unluckily had put it out;
3436,THE GHOST.,"And he, though naturally bold and stout,"
3437,THE GHOST.,"In short, was in a most tremendous stew;--"
3438,THE GHOST.,"The room was fill'd with a sulphureous smell,"
3439,THE GHOST.,But where that came from Mason could not tell.
3440,THE GHOST.,
3441,THE GHOST.,"All motionless the Spectre stood,--and now"
3442,THE GHOST.,Its rev'rend form more clearly shone confest;
3443,THE GHOST.,From the pale cheek a beard of purest snow
3444,THE GHOST.,Descended o'er its venerable breast;
3445,THE GHOST.,"The thin grey hairs, that crown'd its furrow'd brow,"
3446,THE GHOST.,Told of years long gone by.--An awful guest
3447,THE GHOST.,"It stood, and with an action of command,"
3448,THE GHOST.,Beckon'd the Cobbler with its wan right hand.
3449,THE GHOST.,
3450,THE GHOST.,"""Whence, and what art thou, Execrable Shape?"""

3546,THE GHOST.,And o'er the side the masts in thunder go;
3547,THE GHOST.,"While on the deck resistless billows break,"
3548,THE GHOST.,And drag their victims to the gulfs below;--
3549,THE GHOST.,"Such was the scream when, for the want of candle,"
3550,THE GHOST.,Nick Mason drove his awl in up to the handle.
3551,THE GHOST.,
3552,THE GHOST.,"Scared by his Lady's heart-appalling cry,"

3883,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"half in height, was slowly led up and down before the door of the"
3884,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"pharmacopolist by a lean and withered lad, whose appearance warranted"
3885,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"an opinion, pretty generally expressed, that his master found him as"

3887,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"every pound avoirdupois of solid meat, he swallowed, at the least,"
3888,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,two pounds troy-weight of chemicals and galenicals. As the town clock

3935,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"while a silver flagon of ""humming-bub,""--_viz._ ale strong enough to"
3936,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"blow a man's beaver off,--smiled opposite in treacherous amenity."
3937,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,The sideboard groaned beneath sundry massive cups and waiters of
3938,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the purest silver; while the huge skull of a fallow deer, with its"
3939,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"branching horns, frowned majestically above. All spoke of affluence,"
3940,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of comfort,--all save the master, whose restless eye and feverish look"
3941,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,hinted but too plainly the severest mental or bodily disorder. By the
3942,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"side of the proprietor of the mansion sat his consort, a lady now past"
3943,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the bloom of youth, yet still retaining many of its charms. The clear"
3944,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"olive of her complexion, and ""the darkness of her Andalusian eye,"" at"
3945,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"once betrayed her foreign origin; in fact, her ""lord and master,"" as"

3947,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"her to his bosom in a foreign country. The cadet of his family, Master"
3948,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Thomas Marsh, had early in life been engaged in commerce. In the"
3949,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"pursuit of his vocation he had visited Antwerp, Hamburg, and most of"
3950,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the Hanse Towns; and had already formed a tender connexion with the
3951,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"orphan offspring of one of old Alva's officers, when the unexpected"
3952,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"deaths of one immediate, and two presumptive, heirs placed him next in"
3953,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"succession to the family acres. He married, and brought home his bride:"
3954,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"who, by the decease of the venerable possessor, heart-broken at the"
3955,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"loss of his elder children, became eventually lady of Marston-Hall."
3956,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"It has been said that she was beautiful, yet was her beauty of a"
3957,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,character that operates on the fancy more than the affections; she was
3958,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"one to be admired rather than loved. The proud curl of her lip, the"
3959,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"firmness of her tread, her arched brow and stately carriage, showed"
3960,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the decision, not to say haughtiness, of her soul; while her glances,"
3961,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"whether lightening with anger, or melting in extreme softness, betrayed"
3962,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the existence of passions as intense in kind as opposite in quality.
3963,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"She rose as Erasmus entered the parlour, and, bestowing on him a look"

3971,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
3972,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Thus conjured, the practitioner paused, and even turned somewhat"
3973,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"pale. There was a perceptible faltering in his voice, as, evading the"
3974,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"question, he asked, ""What say your other physicians?"""
3975,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
3976,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Doctor Phiz says it is wind,--Doctor Fuz says it is water,--and Doctor"

3986,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
3987,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""It is ever the fate of science,"" murmured the professor, ""to be"

3989,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"folly; let me examine your palate."""
3990,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
3991,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Master Marsh thrust out a tongue long, clear, and red as beetroot."
3992,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""There is nothing wrong there,"" said the Leech. ""Your wrist:--no;--the"
3993,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"pulse is firm and regular, the skin cool and temperate. Sir, there is"

4000,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Why?"""
4001,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,

4004,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Master Marsh's brow grew dark; he half rose from his seat, supported"
4005,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"himself by both hands on the arms of his elbow-chair, and in accents of"

4008,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Ay, fidgety,"" returned the doctor calmly. ""Tut, man, there is nought"

4033,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4034,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"A slight shade crossed the brow of the Leech, but its passage was"
4035,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"momentary; his features softened to a smile, in which pity seemed"

4062,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Of what passed at this interview between the Folkestone doctor and
4063,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the fair Spaniard, Mrs. Botherby declares she could never obtain"
4064,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,any satisfactory elucidation. Not that tradition is silent on the
4065,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"subject,--quite the contrary; it is the abundance, not paucity, of the"
4066,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"materials she supplies, and the consequent embarrassment of selection,"
4067,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"that makes the difficulty. Some have averred that the Leech, whose"
4068,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"character, as has been before hinted, was more than threadbare,"
4069,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,employed his time in teaching her the mode of administering certain
4070,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"noxious compounds, the unconscious partaker whereof would pine and die"
4071,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,so slowly and gradually as to defy suspicion. Others there were who
4072,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,affirmed that Lucifer himself was then and there raised _in propriâ
4073,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"personâ_, with all his terrible attributes of horn and hoof. In"
4074,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"support of this assertion, they adduce the testimony of the aforesaid"
4075,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"buxom housemaid, who protested that the hall smelt that evening like"
4076,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a manufactory of matches. All, however, seemed to agree that the"
4077,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"confabulation, whether human or infernal, was conducted with profound"
4078,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"secrecy, and protracted to a considerable length; that its object, as"
4079,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"far as could be divined, meant anything but good to the head of the"
4080,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"family: that the lady, moreover, was heartily tired of her husband;"
4081,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and that, in the event of his removal by disease or casualty, Master"
4082,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Erasmus Buckthorne, albeit a great philosophist, would have no violent"
4083,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"objection to ""throw physic to the dogs,"" and exchange his laboratory"
4084,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"for the estate of Marston, its live stock included. Some, too, have"
4085,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,inferred that to him did Madame Isabel seriously incline; while others
4086,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"have thought, induced perhaps by subsequent events, that she was"
4087,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"merely using him for her purposes; that one José, a tall, bright-eyed,"
4088,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"hook-nosed stripling from her native land, was a personage not unlikely"
4089,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"to put a spoke in the doctor's wheel; and that, should such a chance"

4094,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"office was that of page to the dame; an office which, after long"
4095,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"remaining in abeyance, has been of late years revived, as may well be"
4096,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"seen in the persons of sundry smart hobbledehoys, now constantly to"
4097,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"be met with on staircases and in boudoirs, clad, for the most part,"
4098,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"in garments fitted tightly to the shape, the lower moiety adorned"
4099,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"with a broad strip of crimson or silver lace, and the upper with what"
4100,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the first Wit of our times has described as ""a favourable eruption"
4101,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of buttons."" The precise duties of this employment have never, as"
4102,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"far as we have heard, been accurately defined. The perfuming a"
4103,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"handkerchief, the combing a lap-dog, and the occasional presentation"
4104,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of a sippet-shaped _billet doux_, are, and always have been, among"
4105,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"them; but these a young gentleman standing five foot ten, and aged"
4106,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"nineteen ""last grass,"" might well be supposed to have outgrown. José,"
4107,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"however, kept his place, perhaps because he was not fit for any other."
4108,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,To the conference between his mistress and the physician he had not
4109,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,been admitted; his post was to keep watch and ward in the ante-room;
4110,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and, when the interview was concluded, he attended the lady and her"
4111,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"visitor as far as the court-yard, where he held, with all due respect,"
4112,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the stirrup for the latter, as he once more resumed his position on the"
4113,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,back of Punch.

4115,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Who is it that says ""little pitchers have large ears?"" Some deep"
4116,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"metaphysician of the potteries, who might have added that they have"
4117,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"also quick eyes, and sometimes silent tongues. There was a little"
4118,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"metaphorical piece of crockery of this class, who, screened by a huge"
4119,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"elbow-chair, had sat a quiet and unobserved spectator of the whole"
4120,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,proceedings between her mamma and Master Erasmus Buckthorne. This was
4121,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Miss Marian Marsh, a rosy-cheeked laughter-loving imp of some six years"
4122,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,old; but one who could be mute as a mouse when the fit was on her. A
4123,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,handsome and highly polished cabinet of the darkest ebony occupied a
4124,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,recess at one end of the apartment; this had long been a great subject
4125,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of speculation to little Miss. Her curiosity, however, had always"
4126,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,been repelled; nor had all her coaxing ever won her an inspection
4127,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,of the thousand and one pretty things which its recesses no doubt
4128,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"contained. On this occasion it was unlocked, and Marian was about to"
4129,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"rush forward in eager anticipation of a peep at its interior, when,"
4130,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"child as she was, the reflection struck her that she would stand a"
4131,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,better chance of carrying her point by remaining _perdue_. Fortune for
4132,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"once favoured her: she crouched closer than before, and saw her mother"
4133,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"take something from one of the drawers, which she handed over to the"
4134,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Leech. Strange mutterings followed, and words whose sound was foreign"
4135,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"to her youthful ears. Had she been older, their import, perhaps, might"
4136,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,have been equally unknown.--After a while there was a pause; and then
4137,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the lady, as in answer to a requisition from the gentleman, placed in"
4138,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"his hand a something which she took from her toilet. The transaction,"
4139,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"whatever its nature, seemed now to be complete, and the article was"
4140,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"carefully replaced in the drawer from which it had been taken. A long,"
4141,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and apparently interesting, conversation then took place between"
4142,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the parties, carried on in a low tone. At its termination, Mistress"
4143,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Marsh and Master Erasmus Buckthorne quitted the boudoir together. But
4144,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the cabinet!--ay, that was left unfastened; the folding-doors still"
4145,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"remained invitingly expanded, the bunch of keys dangling from the lock."
4146,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"In an instant the spoiled child was in a chair; the drawer, so recently"
4147,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"closed, yielded at once to her hand, and her hurried researches were"
4148,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,rewarded by the prettiest little waxen doll imaginable. It was a
4149,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"first-rate prize, and Miss lost no time in appropriating it to herself."
4150,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Long before Madame Marsh had returned to her _Sanctum_, Marian was"
4151,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"seated under a laurestinus in the garden, nursing her new baby with the"
4152,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,most affectionate solicitude.

4168,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"those extended pieces of black pointed wire, with which, in the days"
4169,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of toupees and pompoons, our foremothers were wont to secure their"
4170,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"fly-caps and head-gear from the impertinent assaults of ""Zephyrus and"

4172,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4173,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""And pray, Miss, where did you get this pretty doll, as you call"
4174,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"it!"" asked Susan, turning over the puppet, and viewing it with a"

4183,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4184,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Meanwhile Master Thomas Marsh, and his man Ralph, were threading the"
4185,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"devious paths, then, as now, most pseudonymously dignified with the"
4186,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"name of roads, that wound between Marston-Hall and the frontier of"
4187,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Romney Marsh. Their progress was comparatively slow; for though the
4188,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"brown mare was as good a roadster as man might back, and the gelding"
4189,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"no mean nag of his hands, yet the tracts, rarely traversed save by the"
4190,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"rude wains of the day, miry in the ""bottoms,"" and covered with loose"
4191,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and rolling stones on the higher grounds, rendered barely passable the"
4192,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,perpetual alternation of hill and valley.
4193,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4194,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"The master rode on in pain, and the man in listlessness; although"
4195,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the intercourse between two individuals so situated was much less
4196,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"restrained in those days than might suit the refinement of a later age,"
4197,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,little passed approximating to conversation beyond an occasional and
4198,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"half-stifled groan from the one, or a vacant whistle from the other."
4199,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,An hour's riding had brought them among the woods of Acryse; and they
4200,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"were about to descend one of those green and leafy lanes, rendered by"
4201,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"matted and over-arching branches alike impervious to shower or sunbeam,"
4202,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"when a sudden and violent spasm seized on Master Marsh, and nearly"
4203,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,caused him to fall from his horse. With some difficulty he succeeded
4204,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"in dismounting, and seating himself by the road side. Here he remained"
4205,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,for a full half-hour in great apparent agony; the cold sweat rolled
4206,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"in large round drops adown his clammy forehead, a universal shivering"
4207,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"palsied every limb, his eye-balls appeared to be starting from their"
4208,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"sockets, and to his attached, though dull and heavy serving-man, he"
4209,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,seemed as one struggling in the pangs of impending dissolution. His
4210,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,groans rose thick and frequent; and the alarmed Ralph was hesitating
4211,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"between his disinclination to leave him, and his desire to procure such"
4212,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"assistance as one of the few cottages, rarely sprinkled in that wild"
4213,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"country, might afford, when, after a long-drawn sigh, his master's"
4214,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"features as suddenly relaxed; he declared himself better, the pang had"
4215,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"passed away, and, to use his own expression, he ""felt as if a knife had"
4216,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"been drawn from out his very heart."" With Ralph's assistance, after a"
4217,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"while, he again reached his saddle; and though still ill at ease, from"
4218,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a deep-seated and gnawing pain, which ceased not, as he averred, to"
4219,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"torment him, the violence of the paroxysm was spent, and it returned no"
4220,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,more.
4221,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4222,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Master and man pursued their way with increased speed, as, emerging"
4223,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"from the wooded defiles, they at length neared the coast; then, leaving"
4224,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the romantic castle of Saltwood, with its neighbouring town of Hithe, a"
4225,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"little on their left, they proceeded along the ancient paved causeway,"
4226,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and, crossing the old Roman road, or Watling, plunged again into the"
4227,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,woods that stretched between Lympne and Ostenhanger.
4228,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4229,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"The sun rose high in the heavens, and its meridian blaze was powerfully"
4230,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"felt by man and horse, when, again quitting their leafy covert, the"
4231,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"travellers debouched on the open plain of Aldington Frith, a wide tract"
4232,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of unenclosed country stretching down to the very borders of ""the"
4233,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Marsh"" itself."
4234,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4235,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Here it was, in the neighbouring chapelry, the site of which may yet"
4236,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"be traced by the curious antiquary, that Elizabeth Barton, the ""Holy"
4237,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Maid of Kent,"" had, something less than a hundred years previous to"
4238,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the period of our narrative, commenced that series of supernatural"
4239,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,pranks which eventually procured for her head an unenvied elevation
4240,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,upon London Bridge; and though the parish had since enjoyed the benefit
4241,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,of the incumbency of Master Erasmus's illustrious and enlightened
4242,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Namesake, still, truth to tell, some of the old leaven was even yet"
4243,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"supposed to be at work. The place had, in fact, an ill name; and,"
4244,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"though Popish miracles had ceased to electrify its denizens, spells"
4245,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and charms, operating by a no less wondrous agency, were said to have"
4246,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"taken their place. Warlocks, and other unholy subjects of Satan,"
4247,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"were reported to make its wild recesses their favourite rendezvous,"
4248,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,and that to an extent which eventually attracted the notice of
4249,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"no less a personage than the sagacious Matthew Hopkins himself,"
4250,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Witchfinder-General to the British government.

4252,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"A great portion of the Frith, or Fright, as the name was then, and"

4254,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Free-warren, etc., appertaining to the Archbishops of the Province."
4255,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Since the Reformation, however, it had been disparked; and when Master"
4256,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Thomas Marsh, and his man Ralph, entered upon its confines, the open"
4257,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"greensward exhibited a lively scene, sufficiently explanatory of"
4258,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,certain sounds that had already reached their ears while yet within the
4259,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,sylvan screen which concealed their origin.
4260,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4261,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"It was Fair-day: booths, stalls, and all the rude _paraphernalia_"
4262,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,of an assembly that then met as much for the purposes of traffic
4263,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"as festivity, were scattered irregularly over the turf; pedlars,"
4264,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"with their packs, horse-coupers, pig-merchants, itinerant vendors"
4265,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of crockery and cutlery, wandered promiscuously among the mingled"
4266,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"groups, exposing their several wares and commodities, and soliciting"
4267,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"custom. On one side was the gaudy riband, making its mute appeal to"
4268,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"rustic gallantry; on the other, the delicious brandy-ball and alluring"
4269,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"lollipop, compounded after the most approved receipt in the ""True"
4270,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Gentlewoman's Garland,"" and ""raising the waters"" in the mouth of many"

4273,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Nor were rural sports wanting to those whom pleasure, rather than"
4274,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"business, had drawn from their humble homes. Here was the tall and"

4276,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"cheese, that mocked the hopes of the discomfited climber. There the"
4277,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"fugitive pippin, swimming in water not of the purest, and bobbing"
4278,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,from the expanded lips of the juvenile Tantalus. In this quarter the
4279,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"ear was pierced by squeaks from some beleaguered porker, whisking his"
4280,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,well-soaped tail from the grasp of one already in fancy his captor. In
4281,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"that, the eye rested, with undisguised delight, upon the grimaces of"
4282,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"grinning candidates for the honours of the horse-collar. All was fun,"

4285,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Maid Marian, indeed, with her lieges, Robin Hood, Scarlet, and Little"

4288,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"their bells merrily among stalls well stored with gingerbread, tops,"
4289,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"whips, whistles, and all those noisy instruments of domestic torture in"
4290,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,which scenes like these are even now so fertile.--Had I a foe whom I

4294,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"In one corner of the green, a little apart from the thickest of the"

4296,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the spectators, whose repeated bursts of laughter seemed to intimate"
4297,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the presence of something more than usually amusing. The platform was
4298,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"divided into two unequal portions; the smaller of which, surrounded"
4299,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"by curtains of a coarse canvass, veiled from the eyes of the profane"

4304,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,was hereafter to shed the blessings of health among the admiring
4305,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,crowd. Meanwhile his attendant Jack-pudding was busily employed on
4306,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the _proscenium_, doing his best to attract attention by a practical"
4307,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"facetiousness which took wonderfully with the spectators, interspersing"
4308,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,it with the melodious notes of a huge cow's horn. The fellow's costume
4309,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,varied but little in character from that in which the late (alas!
4310,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,that we should have to write the word--late!) Mr. Joseph Grimaldi
4311,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"was accustomed to present himself before ""a generous and enlightened"

4315,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,from the throat downwards by a single row of broad white metal
4316,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,buttons; and his legs were cased in loose wide trousers of the same
4317,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"material; while his sleeves, prolonged to a most disproportionate"
4318,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"extent, descended far below the fingers, and acted as flappers in the"
4319,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"somersets and caracoles, with which he diversified and enlivened his"
4320,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"antics. Consummate impudence, not altogether unmixed with a certain sly"
4321,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"humour, sparkled in his eye through the chalk and ochre with which his"
4322,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,features were plentifully bedaubed; and especially displayed itself in
4323,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a succession of jokes, the coarseness of which did not seem to detract"
4324,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,from their merit in the eyes of his applauding audience.
4325,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4326,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,He was in the midst of a long and animated harangue explanatory of his
4327,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,master's high pretensions; he had informed his gaping auditors that the
4328,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"latter was the seventh son of a seventh son, and of course, as they"
4329,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"very well knew, an Unborn Doctor; that to this happy accident of birth"
4330,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,he added the advantage of most extensive travel; that in his search
4331,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"after science he had not only perambulated the whole of this world,"
4332,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,but had trespassed on the boundaries of the next: that the depths of
4333,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the Ocean and the bowels of the Earth were alike familiar to him; that
4334,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"besides salves and cataplasms of sovereign virtue, by combining sundry"
4335,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"mosses, gathered many thousand fathoms below the surface of the sea,"
4336,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"with certain unknown drugs found in an undiscovered island, and boiling"

4367,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"warrant thee for the nonce. Hie thee home, friend; infuse this powder"
4368,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"in cold spring-water, fill thy mouth with the mixture, and sit upon thy"
4369,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"fire till it boils!"""
4370,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4371,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Out on thee for a pestilent knave!"" cried the cozened countryman;"
4372,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,but the roar of merriment around bespoke the bystanders well-pleased
4373,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"with the jape put upon him. He retired, venting his spleen in audible"
4374,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"murmurs; and the mountebank, finding the feelings of the mob enlisted"
4375,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"on his side, waxed more impudent every instant, filling up the"
4376,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"intervals between his fooleries with sundry capers and contortions, and"
4377,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,discordant notes from the cow's horn.
4378,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4379,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Draw near, draw near, my masters! Here have ye a remedy for every evil"
4380,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"under the sun, moral, physical, natural, and supernatural! Hath any man"
4381,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,a termagant wife?--here is that will tame her presently! Hath any one a
4382,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"smoky chimney?--here is an incontinent cure!"""
4383,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4384,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"To the first infliction no man ventured to plead guilty, though there"
4385,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,were those standing by who thought their neighbours might have profited
4386,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,withal. For the last-named recipe started forth at least a dozen
4387,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"candidates. With the greatest gravity imaginable, Pierrot, having"
4388,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"pocketed their groats, delivered to each a small packet curiously"
4389,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"folded and closely sealed, containing, as he averred, directions"
4390,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"which, if truly observed, would preclude any chimney from smoking for"
4391,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a whole year. They whose curiosity led them to dive into the mystery,"
4392,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,found that a sprig of mountain ash culled by moonlight was the charm
4393,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"recommended, coupled, however, with the proviso that no fire should be"
4394,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,lighted on the hearth during its exercise.
4395,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4396,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,The frequent bursts of merriment proceeding from this quarter at length
4397,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"attracted the attention of Master Marsh, whose line of road necessarily"
4398,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,brought him near this end of the fair; he drew bit in front of the
4399,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"stage just as its noisy occupant, having laid aside his formidable"
4400,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"horn, was drawing still more largely on the amazement of ""the public"""
4401,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"by a feat of especial wonder,--he was eating fire! Curiosity mingled"
4402,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,with astonishment was at its height; and feelings not unallied to alarm
4403,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"were beginning to manifest themselves, among the softer sex especially,"
4404,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,as they gazed on the flames that issued from the mouth of the living
4405,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"volcano. All eyes, indeed, were fixed upon the fire-eater with an"
4406,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,intentness that left no room for observing another worthy who had now
4407,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"emerged upon the scene. This was, however, no less a personage than the"
4408,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"_Deus ex machinâ_,--the illustrious Aldrovando himself."
4409,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4410,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Short in stature and spare in form, the sage had somewhat increased"
4411,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the former by a steeple-crowned hat adorned with a cock's feather;
4412,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"while the thick shoulder-padding of a quilted doublet, surmounted by"
4413,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a falling band, added a little to his personal importance in point of"
4414,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"breadth. His habit was composed throughout of black serge, relieved"
4415,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,with scarlet slashes in the sleeves and trunks; red was the feather in
4416,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"his hat, red were the roses in his shoes, which rejoiced moreover in a"
4417,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"pair of red heels. The lining of a short cloak of faded velvet, that"
4418,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"hung transversely over his left shoulder, was also red. Indeed, from"
4419,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"all that we could ever see or hear, this agreeable alternation of red"
4420,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,and black appears to be the mixture of colours most approved at the
4421,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"court of Beelzebub, and the one most generally adopted by his friends"
4422,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and favourites. His features were sharp and shrewd, and a fire sparkled"
4423,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"in his keen grey eye, much at variance with the wrinkles that ran their"
4424,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,irregular furrows above his prominent and bushy brows. He had advanced
4425,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,slowly from behind the screen while the attention of the multitude
4426,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"was absorbed by the pyrotechnics of Mr. Merryman, and, stationing"
4427,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"himself at the extreme corner of the stage, stood quietly leaning on"
4428,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a crutch-handle walking-staff of blackest ebony, his glance steadily"
4429,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"fixed on the face of Marsh, from whose countenance the amusement he had"
4430,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,insensibly begun to derive had not succeeded in removing all traces of
4431,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,bodily pain.
4432,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4433,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,For a while the latter was unobservant of the inquisitorial survey with
4434,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"which he was regarded; the eyes of the parties, however, at length met."
4435,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,The brown mare had a fine shoulder; she stood pretty nearly sixteen
4436,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"hands. Marsh himself, though slightly bowed by ill health and the"
4437,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""coming autumn"" of life, was full six feet in height. His elevation"
4438,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"giving him an unobstructed view over the heads of the pedestrians, he"
4439,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"had naturally fallen into the rear of the assembly, which brought him"
4440,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"close to the diminutive Doctor, with whose face, despite the red heels,"
4441,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,his own was about upon a level.
4442,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4443,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""And what makes Master Marsh here?--what sees he in the mummeries of a"
4444,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"miserable buffoon to divert him when his life is in jeopardy?"" said a"
4445,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,shrill cracked voice that sounded as in his very ear. It was the Doctor
4446,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,who spoke.
4447,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4448,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Knowest thou me, friend?"" said Marsh, scanning with awakened interest"
4449,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the figure of his questioner: ""I call thee not to mind; and yet--stay,"
4450,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"where have we met?"""
4451,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4452,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""It skills not to declare,"" was the answer; ""suffice it we _have_"
4453,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"met,--in other climes perchance,--and now meet happily again--happily"
4454,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"at least for thee."""
4455,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4456,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Why truly the trick of thy countenance reminds me of somewhat I have"
4457,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"seen before; where or when I know not: but what wouldst thou with me?"""
4458,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4459,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Nay, rather what wouldst thou here, Thomas Marsh? What wouldst thou on"
4460,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the Frith of Aldington?--is it a score or two of paltry sheep? or is it
4461,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"something _nearer to thy heart_?"""
4462,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4463,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Marsh started as the last words were pronounced with more than
4464,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"common significance: a pang shot through him at the moment, and the"
4465,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,vinegar aspect of the charlatan seemed to relax into a smile half
4466,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"compassionate, half sardonic."
4467,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4468,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Grammercy,"" quoth Marsh, after a long-drawn breath, ""what knowest thou"
4469,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of me, fellow, or of my concerns? What knowest thou--"""
4470,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4471,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""This know I, Master Thomas Marsh,"" said the stranger gravely, ""that"
4472,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"thy life is even now perilled, evil practices are against thee; but no"
4473,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"matter, thou art quit for the nonce--other hands than mine have saved"
4474,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"thee! Thy pains are over. Hark! _the clock strikes One!_"" As he spoke"
4475,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a single toll from the bell-tower of Bilsington came, wafted by the"
4476,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"western breeze, over the thick-set and lofty oaks which intervened"
4477,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,between the Frith and what had been once a priory. Doctor Aldrovando
4478,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"turned as the sound came floating on the wind, and was moving, as"
4479,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"if half in anger, towards the other side of the stage, where the"
4480,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"mountebank, his fires extinct, was now disgorging to the admiring crowd"
4481,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,yard after yard of gaudy-coloured riband.
4482,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4483,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Stay! Nay, prithee stay!"" cried Marsh eagerly, ""I was wrong; in faith"
4484,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"I was. A change, and that a sudden and most marvellous, hath indeed"
4485,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,come over me; I am free; I breathe again; I feel as though a load of
4486,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"years had been removed; and--is it possible?--hast thou done this?"""
4487,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4488,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Thomas Marsh!"" said the doctor, pausing, and turning for the moment on"
4489,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"his heel, ""I have _not_: I repeat that other and more innocent hands"
4490,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"than mine have done this deed. Nevertheless, heed my counsel well! Thou"
4491,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"art parlously encompassed; I, and I only, have the means of relieving"
4492,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,thee. Follow thy courses; pursue thy journey; but as thou valuest life
4493,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and more than life, be at the foot of yonder woody knoll what time the"
4494,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,rising moon throws her first beam upon the bare and blighted summit
4495,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"that towers above its trees."""
4496,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4497,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"He crossed abruptly to the opposite quarter of the scaffolding, and"
4498,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,was in an instant deeply engaged in listening to those whom the cow's
4499,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"horn had attracted, and in prescribing for their real or fancied"
4500,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,ailments. Vain were all Marsh's efforts again to attract his notice;
4501,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"it was evident that he studiously avoided him; and when, after an hour"
4502,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"or more spent in useless endeavour, he saw the object of his anxiety"
4503,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"seclude himself once more within his canvass screen, he rode slowly and"
4504,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,thoughtfully off the field.
4505,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4506,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,What should he do? Was the man a mere quack? an impostor?--His name
4507,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"thus obtained?--that might be easily done. But then, his secret griefs;"
4508,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the doctor's knowledge of them; their cure; for he felt that his pains
4509,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"were gone, his healthful feelings restored!"
4510,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4511,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"True, Aldrovando, if that were his name, had disclaimed all"
4512,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"cooperation in his recovery; but he knew, or he at least announced"
4513,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"it. Nay, more, he had hinted that he was yet in jeopardy; that"
4514,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,practices--and the chord sounded strangely in unison with one that had
4515,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,before vibrated within him--that practices were in operation against
4516,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"his life! It was enough! He would keep tryst with the Conjuror, if"
4517,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"conjuror he were; and, at least, ascertain who and what he was, and how"
4518,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,he had become acquainted with his own person and secret afflictions.
4519,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4520,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"When the late Mr. Pitt was determined to keep out Bonaparte, and"
4521,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"prevent his gaining a settlement in the county of Kent, among other"
4522,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"ingenious devices adopted for that purpose, he caused to be constructed"
4523,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"what was then, and has ever since been conventionally termed a"
4524,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Military Canal."" This is a not very practicable ditch, some thirty"
4525,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"feet wide, and nearly nine feet deep--in the middle,--extending from"
4526,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the town and port of Hithe to within a mile of the town and port of
4527,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Rye, a distance of about twenty miles, and forming, as it were, the"
4528,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"cord of a bow, the arc of which constitutes that remote fifth quarter"
4529,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,of the globe spoken of by travellers. Trivial objections to the plan
4530,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,were made at the time by cavillers; and an old gentleman of the
4531,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"neighbourhood, who proposed as a cheap substitute, to put down his own"
4532,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"cocked-hat upon a pole, was deservedly pooh-pooh'd down; in fact, the"
4533,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"job, though rather an expensive one, was found to answer remarkably"
4534,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,well. The French managed indeed to scramble over the Rhine and the
4535,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Rhone, and other insignificant currents, but they never did, or could,"
4536,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"pass Mr. Pitt's ""Military Canal."" At no great distance from the centre"
4537,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of this cord rises abruptly a sort of woody promontory, in shape almost"
4538,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"conical; its sides covered with thick underwood, above which is seen a"
4539,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"bare and brown summit rising like an Alp in miniature. The ""defence"
4540,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of the nation"" not being then in existence, Master Marsh met with no"
4541,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,obstruction in reaching this place of appointment long before the time
4542,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,prescribed.
4543,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4544,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"So much, indeed, was his mind occupied by his adventure and"
4545,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"extraordinary cure, that his original design had been abandoned, and"
4546,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Master Cobbe remained unvisited. A rude hostel in the neighbourhood
4547,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"furnished entertainment for man and horse; and here, a full hour before"
4548,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the rising of the moon, he left Ralph and the other beasts, proceeding"
4549,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,to his rendezvous on foot and alone.
4550,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4551,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""You are punctual, Master Marsh,"" squeaked the shrill voice of the"
4552,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Doctor, issuing from the thicket as the first silvery gleam trembled on"
4553,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the aspens above. ""'Tis well: now follow me and in silence."""
4554,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4555,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"The first part of the command Marsh hesitated not to obey, the second"
4556,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,was more difficult of observance.
4557,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4558,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Who and what are you? Whither are you leading me?"" burst not"
4559,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,unnaturally from his lips; but all question was at once cut short by
4560,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the peremptory tones of his guide.
4561,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4562,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Hush! I say; your finger on your lip, there be hawks abroad: follow"
4563,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"me, and that silently and quickly."" The little man turned as he spoke,"
4564,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and led the way through a scarcely perceptible path or track, which"
4565,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,wound among the underwood. The lapse of a few minutes brought them
4566,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"to the door of a low building, so hidden by the surrounding trees"
4567,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,that few would have suspected its existence. It was a cottage of
4568,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"rather extraordinary dimensions, but consisting of only one floor. No"
4569,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,smoke rose from its solitary chimney; no cheering ray streamed from
4570,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"its single window, which was, however, secured by a shutter of such"
4571,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,thickness as to preclude the possibility of any stray beam issuing
4572,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"from within. The exact size of the building it was, in that uncertain"
4573,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"light, difficult to distinguish, a portion of it seeming buried in"
4574,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the wood behind. The door gave way on the application of a key, and"
4575,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Marsh followed his conductor resolutely but cautiously along a narrow
4576,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"passage, feebly lighted by a small taper that winked and twinkled at"
4577,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"its farther extremity. The Doctor, as he approached, raised it from the"
4578,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"ground, and, opening an adjoining door, ushered his guest into the room"
4579,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,beyond.
4580,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4581,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"It was a large and oddly furnished apartment, insufficiently lighted"
4582,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"by an iron lamp that hung from the roof, and scarcely illuminated the"
4583,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"walls and angles, which seemed to be composed of some dark-coloured"
4584,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"wood. On one side, however, Master Marsh could discover an article"
4585,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,bearing strong resemblance to a coffin; on the other was a large oval
4586,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"mirror in an ebony frame, and in the midst of the floor was described"
4587,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"in red chalk a double circle about six feet in diameter, its inner"
4588,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"verge inscribed with sundry hieroglyphics, agreeably relieved at"
4589,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,intervals with an alternation of skulls and cross bones. In the very
4590,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,centre was deposited one skull of such surpassing size and thickness as
4591,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,would have filled the soul of a Spurzheim or De Ville with wonderment.
4592,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"A large book, a naked sword, an hour glass, a chafing dish, and a"
4593,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"black cat, completed the list of moveables; with the exception of a"
4594,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"couple of tapers which stood on each side of the mirror, and which the"
4595,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,strange gentleman now proceeded to light from the one in his hand. As
4596,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"they flared up with what Marsh thought a most unnatural brilliancy,"
4597,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,he perceived reflected in the glass behind a dial suspended over the
4598,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,coffin-like article already mentioned: the hand was fast verging
4599,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,towards the hour of nine. The eyes of the little Doctor seemed riveted
4600,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,on the horologe.
4601,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4602,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Now strip thee, Master Marsh, and that quickly: untruss, I say!"
4603,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"discard thy boots, doff doublet and hose, and place thyself incontinent"
4604,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"in yonder bath."""
4605,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4606,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"The visitor cast his eyes again upon the formidable-looking article,"
4607,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and perceived that it was nearly filled with water. A cold bath, at"
4608,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"such an hour and under such auspices, was anything but inviting: he"
4609,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"hesitated, and turned his eyes alternately on the Doctor and the Black"
4610,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Cat.
4611,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4612,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Trifle not the time, man, an you be wise,"" said the former: ""Passion"
4613,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of my heart! let but yon minute-hand reach the hour, and thou not"
4614,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"immersed, thy life were not worth a pin's fee!"""
4615,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4616,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"The Black Cat gave vent to a single Mew,--a most unnatural sound for a"
4617,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"mouser,--it seemed as it were mewed through a cow's horn."
4618,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4619,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Quick, Master Marsh! uncase, or you perish!"" repeated his strange"
4620,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"host, throwing as he spoke a handful of some dingy-looking powders into"
4621,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the brazier. ""Behold the attack is begun!"" A thick cloud rose from the"
4622,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,embers; a cold shivering shook the astonished Yeoman; sharp pricking
4623,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"pains penetrated his ankles and the palms of his hands, and, as the"
4624,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"smoke cleared away, he distinctly saw and recognised in the mirror the"
4625,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,boudoir of Marston Hall.
4626,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4627,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,The doors of the well-known ebony cabinet were closed; but fixed
4628,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"against them, and standing out in strong relief from the contrast"
4629,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"afforded by the sable background, was a waxen image--of himself! It"
4630,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"appeared to be secured, and sustained in an upright posture, by large"
4631,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"black pins driven through the feet and palms, the latter of which were"
4632,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,extended in a cruciform position. To the right and left stood his wife
4633,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and José; in the middle, with his back towards him, was a figure which"
4634,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,he had no difficulty in recognising as that of the Leech of Folkestone.
4635,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,The latter had just succeeded in fastening the dexter hand of the
4636,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"image, and was now in the act of drawing a broad and keen-edged sabre"
4637,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"from its sheath. The Black Cat mewed again. ""Haste or you die!"" said"
4638,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the Doctor,--Marsh looked at the dial; it wanted but four minutes of"
4639,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,nine: he felt that the crisis of his fate was come. Off went his heavy
4640,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"boots; doublet to the right, galligaskins to the left; never was man"
4641,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"more swiftly disrobed: in two minutes, to use an Indian expression, ""he"
4642,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"was all face!"" in another he was on his back, and up to his chin, in a"
4643,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,bath which smelt strongly as of brimstone and garlic.
4644,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4645,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""Heed well the clock!"" cried the Conjuror: ""with the first stroke of"
4646,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Nine plunge thy head beneath the water, suffer not a hair above the"
4647,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"surface: plunge deeply, or thou art lost!"""
4648,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4649,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,The little man had seated himself in the centre of the circle upon the
4650,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"large skull, elevating his legs at an angle of forty-five degrees. In"
4651,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,this position he spun round with a velocity to be equalled only by that
4652,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of a tee-totum, the red roses on his insteps seeming to describe a"
4653,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,circle of fire. The best buckskins that ever mounted at Melton had soon
4654,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"yielded to such rotatory friction--but he spun on--the Cat mewed, bats"
4655,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,and obscene birds fluttered over-head; Erasmus was seen to raise his
4656,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"weapon, the clock struck!--and Marsh, who had ""ducked"" at the instant,"
4657,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"popped up his head again, spitting and sputtering, half-choked with"
4658,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the infernal solution, which had insinuated itself into his mouth, and"
4659,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"ears, and nose. All disgust at his nauseous dip, was, however, at once"
4660,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"removed, when, casting his eyes on the glass, he saw the consternation"
4661,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,of the party whose persons it exhibited. Erasmus had evidently made his
4662,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,blow and failed; the figure was unmutilated; the hilt remained in the
4663,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"hand of the striker, while the shivered blade lay in shining fragments"
4664,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,on the floor.
4665,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4666,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"The Conjuror ceased his spinning, and brought himself to an anchor;"
4667,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the Black Cat purred,--its purring seemed strangely mixed with the"
4668,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,self-satisfied chuckle of a human being.--Where had Marsh heard
4669,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,something like it before?
4670,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4671,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"He was rising from his unsavoury couch, when a motion from the little"
4672,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"man checked him. ""Rest where you are, Thomas Marsh; so far all goes"
4673,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"well, but the danger is not yet over!"" He looked again, and perceived"
4674,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,that the shadowy triumvirate were in deep and eager consultation; the
4675,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,fragments of the shattered weapon appeared to undergo a close scrutiny.
4676,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,The result was clearly unsatisfactory; the lips of the parties moved
4677,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"rapidly, and much gesticulation might be observed, but no sound fell"
4678,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,upon the ear. The hand of the dial had nearly reached the quarter:
4679,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,at once the parties separated: and Buckthorne stood again before the
4680,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"figure, his hand armed with a long and sharp-pointed _misericorde_,"
4681,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a dagger little in use of late, but such as, a century before, often"
4682,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"performed the part of a modern oyster-knife, in tickling the osteology"
4683,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,of a dismounted cavalier through the shelly defences of his plate
4684,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"armour. Again he raised his arm. ""Duck!"" roared the Doctor, spinning"
4685,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"away upon his cephalic pivot:--the Black Cat cocked his tail, and"
4686,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"seemed to mew the word ""Duck!"" Down went Master Marsh's head;--one of"
4687,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,his hands had unluckily been resting on the edge of the bath: he drew
4688,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"it hastily in, but not altogether scatheless; the stump of a rusty"
4689,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"nail, projecting from the margin of the bath, had caught and slightly"
4690,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,grazed it. The pain was more acute than is usually produced by such
4691,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"trivial accidents; and Marsh, on once more raising his head, beheld the"
4692,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"dagger of the Leech sticking in the little finger of the wax figure,"
4693,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,which it had seemingly nailed to the cabinet door.
4694,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4695,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"""By my truly, a scape o' the narrowest!"" quoth the Conjuror: ""the next"
4696,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"course, dive you not the readier, there is no more life in you than in"
4697,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a pickled herring.--What! courage, Master Marsh; but be heedful; an"
4698,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"they miss again, let them bide the issue!"""
4699,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4700,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"He drew his hand athwart his brow as he spoke, and dashed off the"
4701,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"perspiration, which the violence of his exercise had drawn from"
4702,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"every pore. Black Tom sprang upon the edge of the bath, and stared"
4703,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,full in the face of the bather: his sea-green eyes were lambent with
4704,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"unholy fire, but their marvellous obliquity of vision was not to be"
4705,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"mistaken;--the very countenance, too!--Could it be?--the features were"
4706,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"feline, but their expression was that of the Jack Pudding! Was the"
4707,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Mountebank a Cat?--or the Cat a Mountebank?--it was all a mystery;--and
4708,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Heaven knows how long Marsh might have continued staring at Grimalkin,"
4709,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,had not his attention been again called by Aldrovando to the magic
4710,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,mirror.
4711,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4712,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Great dissatisfaction, not to say dismay, seemed now to pervade the"
4713,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,conspirators; Dame Isabel was closely inspecting the figure's wounded
4714,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"hand, while José was aiding the pharmacopolist to charge a huge"
4715,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,petronel with powder and bullets. The load was a heavy one; but Erasmus
4716,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,seemed determined this time to make sure of his object. Somewhat of
4717,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,trepidation might be observed in his manner as he rammed down the
4718,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"balls, and his withered cheek appeared to have acquired an increase of"
4719,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"paleness; but amazement rather than fear was the prevailing symptom,"
4720,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,and his countenance betrayed no jot of irresolution. As the clock was
4721,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"about to chime half-past nine, he planted himself with a firm foot in"
4722,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"front of the image, waved his unoccupied hand with a cautionary gesture"
4723,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"to his companions, and, as they hastily retired on either side, brought"
4724,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the muzzle of his weapon within half a foot of his mark. As the shadowy
4725,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"form was about to draw the trigger, Marsh again plunged his head"
4726,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"beneath the surface; and the sound of an explosion, as of fire-arms,"
4727,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,mingled with the rush of water that poured into his ears. His immersion
4728,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"was but momentary, yet did he feel as though half suffocated: he sprang"
4729,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"from the bath, and, as his eye fell on the mirror, he saw,--or thought"
4730,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"he saw,--the Leech of Folkestone lying dead on the floor of his wife's"
4731,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"boudoir, his head shattered to pieces, and his hand still grasping the"
4732,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,stock of a bursten petronel.
4733,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4734,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"He saw no more; his head swam; his senses reeled, the whole room was"
4735,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"turning round, and, as he fell to the ground, the last impressions to"
4736,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"which he was conscious were the chucklings of a hoarse laughter, and"
4737,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,the mewings of a Tom Cat!
4738,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4739,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Master Marsh was found the next morning by his bewildered serving-man,"
4740,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,stretched before the door of the humble hostel at which he sojourned.
4741,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,His clothes were somewhat torn and much bemired! and deeply did
4742,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,honest Ralph marvel that one so staid and grave as Master Marsh of
4743,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Marston should thus have played the roisterer, missing, perchance, a"
4744,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"profitable bargain for the drunken orgies of midnight wassail, or the"
4745,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,endearments of some rustic light-o'-love. Tenfold was his astonishment
4746,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"increased when, after retracing in silence their journey of the"
4747,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"preceding day, the Hall, on their arrival about noon, was found in a"
4748,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,state of uttermost confusion.--No wife stood there to greet with the
4749,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,smile of bland affection her returning spouse; no page to hold his
4750,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"stirrup, or receive his gloves, his hat, and riding-rod.--The doors"
4751,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"were open, the rooms in most admired disorder; men and maidens peeping,"
4752,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"hurrying hither and thither, and popping in and out, like rabbits in a"
4753,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,warren.--The lady of the mansion was nowhere to be found.
4754,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4755,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"José, too, had disappeared; the latter had been last seen riding"
4756,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,furiously towards Folkestone early in the preceding afternoon; to a
4757,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"question from Hodge Gardener he had hastily answered, that he bore a"
4758,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,missive of moment from his mistress. The lean apprentice of Erasmus
4759,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Buckthorne declared that the page had summoned his master, in haste,"
4760,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"about six of the clock, and that they had rode forth together, as he"
4761,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"verily believed, on their way back to the Hall, where he had supposed"
4762,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Master Buckthorne's services to be suddenly required on some pressing
4763,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,emergency. Since that time he had seen nought of either of them: the
4764,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"grey cob, however, had returned late at night, masterless, with his"
4765,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"girths loose, and the saddle turned upside down."
4766,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4767,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Nor was Master Erasmus Buckthorne ever seen again. Strict search was
4768,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"made through the neighbourhood, but without success; and it was at"
4769,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"length presumed that he must, for reasons which nobody could divine,"
4770,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"have absconded, together with José and his faithless mistress. The"
4771,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"latter had carried off with her the strong box, divers articles of"
4772,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"valuable plate, and jewels of price. Her boudoir appeared to have been"
4773,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,completely ransacked; the cabinet and drawers stood open and empty; the
4774,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"very carpet, a luxury then newly introduced into England, was gone."
4775,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Marsh, however, could trace no vestige of the visionary scene which he"
4776,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,affirmed to have been last night presented to his eyes.
4777,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4778,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Much did the neighbours marvel at his story:--some thought him mad;
4779,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"others, that he was merely indulging in that privilege to which, as"
4780,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a traveller, he had a right indefeasible. Trusty Ralph said nothing,"
4781,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"but shrugged his shoulders; and, falling into the rear, imitated the"
4782,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"action of raising a wine-cup to his lips. An opinion, indeed, soon"
4783,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"prevailed, that Master Thomas Marsh had gotten, in common parlance,"
4784,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"exceedingly drunk on the preceding evening, and had dreamt all that"
4785,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,he so circumstantially related. This belief acquired additional
4786,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"credit when they, whom curiosity induced to visit the woody knoll of"
4787,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Aldington Mount, declared that they could find no building such as that"
4788,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"described, nor any cottage near; save one, indeed, a low-roofed hovel,"
4789,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"once a house of public entertainment, but now half in ruins. The ""Old"
4790,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Cat and Fiddle""--so was the tenement called--had been long uninhabited;"
4791,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"yet still exhibited the remains of a broken sign, on which the keen"
4792,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,observer might decipher something like a rude portrait of the animal
4793,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,from which it derived its name. It was also supposed still to afford
4794,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"an occasional asylum to the smugglers of the coast, but no trace of"
4795,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,any visit from sage or mountebank could be detected; nor was the wise
4796,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Aldrovando, whom many remembered to have seen at the fair, ever found"
4797,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,again on all that country-side.
4798,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4799,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Of the runaways nothing was ever certainly known. A boat, the property"
4800,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of an old fisherman who plied his trade on the outskirts of the town,"
4801,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,had been seen to quit the bay that night; and there were those who
4802,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"declared that she had more hands on board than Carden and his son, her"
4803,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"usual complement; but, as the gale came on, and the frail bark was"
4804,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"eventually found keel upwards on the Goodwin Sands, it was presumed"
4805,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"that she had struck on that fatal quicksand in the dark, and that all"
4806,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,on board had perished.
4807,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4808,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Little Marian, whom her profligate mother had abandoned, grew up to be"
4809,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"a fine girl, and a handsome. She became, moreover, heiress to Marston"
4810,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"Hall, and brought the estate into the Ingoldsby family by her marriage"
4811,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,with one of its scions.
4812,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4813,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Thus far Mrs. Botherby.
4814,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4815,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"It is a little singular that, on pulling down the old Hall in my"
4816,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"grandfather's time, a human skeleton was discovered among the rubbish;"
4817,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,under what particular part of the building I could never with any
4818,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"accuracy ascertain; but it was found enveloped in a tattered cloth,"
4819,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"that seemed to have been once a carpet, and which fell to pieces almost"
4820,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"immediately on being exposed to the air. The bones were perfect,"
4821,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"but those of one hand were wanting; and the skull, perhaps from the"
4822,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"labourer's pick-axe, had received considerable injury; the worm-eaten"
4823,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"stock of an old-fashioned pistol lay near, together with a rusty piece"
4824,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of iron which a workman, more sagacious than his fellows, pronounced a"
4825,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"portion of the lock, but nothing was found which the utmost stretch of"
4826,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,human ingenuity could twist into a barrel.
4827,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,
4828,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,The portrait of the fair Marian hangs yet in the Gallery of Tappington;
4829,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and near it is another, of a young man in the prime of life, whom Mrs."
4830,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,Botherby affirms to be that of her father. It exhibits a mild and
4831,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"rather melancholy countenance, with a high forehead, and the peaked"
4832,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,beard and moustaches of the seventeenth century. The signet-finger
4833,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"of the left hand is gone, and appears, on close inspection, to have"
4834,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,been painted out by some later artist; possibly in compliment to the
4835,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"tradition, which, _teste Botherby_, records that of Mr. Marsh to have"
4836,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"gangrened, and to have undergone amputation at the knuckle-joint. If"
4837,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"really the resemblance of the gentleman alluded to, it must have been"
4838,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,taken at some period antecedent to his marriage. There is neither date
4839,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"nor painter's name; but, a little above the head, on the dexter side of"
4840,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"the picture, is an escutcheon, bearing ""Quarterly, Gules and Argent,"
4841,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"in the first quarter a horse's head of the second;"" beneath it are the"
4842,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"words ""_Ætatis suæ_ 26."" On the opposite side is the following mark,"
4843,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"which Mr. Simpkinson declares to be that of a Merchant of the Staple,"
4844,THE LEECH OF FOLKESTONE.,"and pretends to discover, in the monogram comprised in it, all the"

7620,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,"Her father's retainers now had her in view,"
7621,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,As she found from their raising a joyous halloo;
7622,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,"While the Count, riding on at the head of his crew,"
7623,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,"In their snuff-colour'd doublets and breeches of blue,"
7624,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,Was huzzaing and urging them on to pursue.--

7628,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,"And to go further on was impossible;--true,"

7631,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,Up to bidding the world such a sudden adieu:--
7632,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,Alack! how she envied the birds as they flew;
7633,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,"No Nassau balloon, with its wicker canoe,"
7634,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,Came to bear her from him she loath'd worse than a Jew;
7635,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,"So she fell on her knees in a terrible stew,"
7636,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,"Crying ""Holy St. Ermengarde!"
7637,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,"Oh, from these vermin guard"

7642,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,It's delightful to see those who strive to oppress

7644,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,The Saint came to the rescue!--I fairly confess
7645,THE LAY OF ST. ODILLE.,"I don't see, as a Saint, how she well could do less"

8144,THE LADY ROHESIA.,The Lady Rohesia lay on her death-bed!
8145,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8146,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"So said the doctor,--and doctors are generally allowed to be judges"
8147,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"in these matters;--besides, Doctor Butts was the Court Physician:"
8148,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"he carried a crutch-handled staff, with its cross of the blackest"
8149,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"ebony,--_raison de plus!_"
8150,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8151,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Is there no hope, Doctor?"" said Beatrice Grey."
8152,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8153,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Is there no hope?"" said Everard Ingoldsby."
8154,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8155,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Is there no hope?"" said Sir Guy de Montgomeri.--He was the Lady"
8156,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Rohesia's husband;--he spoke the last.
8157,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8158,THE LADY ROHESIA.,The doctor shook his head: he looked at the disconsolate widower _in
8159,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"posse_, then at the hour-glass;--its waning sand seemed sadly to shadow"
8160,THE LADY ROHESIA.,forth the sinking pulse of his patient. Dr. Butts was a very learned
8161,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"man. ""_Ars longa, vita brevis!_"" said Doctor Butts."
8162,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8163,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""I am very sorry to hear it,"" quoth Sir Guy de Montgomeri."
8164,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8165,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Sir Guy was a brave knight, and a tall; but he was no scholar."
8166,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8167,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Alas! my poor Sister!"" sighed Ingoldsby."
8168,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8169,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Alas! my poor Mistress!"" sobbed Beatrice."
8170,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8171,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Sir Guy neither sighed nor sobbed;--his grief was too deep-seated for
8172,THE LADY ROHESIA.,outward manifestation.
8173,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8174,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""And how long, Doctor--?"" The afflicted husband could not finish the"
8175,THE LADY ROHESIA.,sentence.
8176,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8177,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Doctor Butts withdrew his hand from the wrist of the dying lady; he
8178,THE LADY ROHESIA.,pointed to the horologe; scarcely a quarter of its sand remained in the
8179,THE LADY ROHESIA.,upper moiety. Again he shook his head; the eye of the patient waxed
8180,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"dimmer, the rattling in the throat increased."
8181,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8182,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""What's become of Father Francis?"" whimpered Beatrice."

8185,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8186,THE LADY ROHESIA.,A darker shade came over the brow of Sir Guy.
8187,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8188,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Where _is_ the Confessor?"" continued his grieving brother-in-law."
8189,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8190,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""In the pantry,"" cried Marion Hacket pertly, as she tripped down stairs"
8191,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"in search of that venerable ecclesiastic;--""in the pantry, I warrant"
8192,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"me.""--The bower-woman was not wont to be in the wrong;--in the pantry"
8193,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"was the holy man discovered,--at his devotions."
8194,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8195,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""_Pax vobiscum!_"" said Father Francis, as he entered the chamber of"
8196,THE LADY ROHESIA.,death.
8197,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8198,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""_Vita brevis!_"" retorted Doctor Butts:--he was not a man to be"
8199,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"browbeat out of his Latin,--and by a paltry Friar Minim, too. Had"
8200,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"it been a Bishop, indeed,--or even a mitred Abbot;--but a miserable"
8201,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Franciscan!
8202,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8203,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""_Benedicite!_"" said the friar."
8204,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8205,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""_Ars longa!_"" returned the Leech."
8206,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8207,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Doctor Butts adjusted the tassels of his falling band; drew his short
8208,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"sad-coloured cloak closer around him; and, grasping his cross-handled"
8209,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"walking-staff, stalked majestically out of the apartment.--Father"
8210,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Francis had the field to himself.
8211,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8212,THE LADY ROHESIA.,The worthy chaplain hastened to administer the last rites of the
8213,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"church. To all appearance he had little time to lose; as he concluded,"
8214,THE LADY ROHESIA.,the dismal toll of the passing-bell sounded from the belfry tower;
8215,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"little Hubert, the bandy-legged sacristan, was pulling with all his"
8216,THE LADY ROHESIA.,might.--It was a capital contrivance that same passing-bell:--which of
8217,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"the Urbans or Innocents invented it is a query; but, whoever he was, he"
8218,THE LADY ROHESIA.,deserved well of his country and of Christendom.
8219,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8220,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Ah! our ancestors were not such fools, after all, as we, their"
8221,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"degenerate children, conceit them to have been. The passing bell! a"
8222,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"most solemn warning to imps of every description, is not to be regarded"
8223,THE LADY ROHESIA.,with impunity: the most impudent _Succubus_ of them all dare as well
8224,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"dip his claws in holy water, as come within the verge of its sound."
8225,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Old Nick himself, if he sets any value at all upon his tail, had"
8226,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"best convey himself clean out of hearing, and leave the way open to"
8227,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Paradise. Little Hubert continued pulling with all his might, and St."
8228,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Peter began to look out for a customer.
8229,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8230,THE LADY ROHESIA.,The knell seemed to have some effect even upon the Lady Rohesia:
8231,THE LADY ROHESIA.,she raised her head slightly; inarticulate sounds issued from her
8232,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"lips,--inarticulate, that is, to the profane ears of the laity. Those"
8233,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"of Father Francis, indeed, were sharper; nothing, as he averred, could"
8234,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"be more distinct than the words, ""A thousand marks to the priory of St."
8235,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Mary Rouncival."""
8236,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8237,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Now the Lady Rohesia Ingoldsby had brought her husband broad lands
8238,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"and large possessions; much of her ample dowry, too, was at her own"
8239,THE LADY ROHESIA.,disposal; and nuncupative wills had not yet been abolished by Act of
8240,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Parliament.
8241,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8242,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Pious soul!"" ejaculated Father Francis. ""A thousand marks, she said--"""
8243,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8244,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""If she did, I'll be shot!"" said Guy de Montgomeri."
8245,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8246,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""--A thousand marks!"" continued the Confessor, fixing his cold grey"
8247,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"eye upon the knight, as he went on heedless of the interruption;--""a"
8248,THE LADY ROHESIA.,thousand marks! and as many _Aves_ and _Paters_ shall be duly said--as
8249,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"soon as the money is paid down."""
8250,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8251,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Sir Guy shrank from the monk's gaze; he turned to the window, and"
8252,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"muttered to himself something that sounded like ""Don't you wish you may"
8253,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"get it?"""
8254,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8255,THE LADY ROHESIA.,*       *       *       *       *
8256,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8257,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"The bell continued to toll. Father Francis had quitted the room, taking"
8258,THE LADY ROHESIA.,with him the remains of the holy oil he had been using for Extreme
8259,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Unction. Everard Ingoldsby waited on him down stairs.
8260,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8261,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""A thousand thanks!"" said the latter."
8262,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8263,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""A thousand marks!"" said the friar."
8264,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8265,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""A thousand devils!"" growled Sir Guy de Montgomeri, from the top of the"
8266,THE LADY ROHESIA.,landing-place.
8267,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8268,THE LADY ROHESIA.,But his accents fell unheeded; his brother-in-law and the friar were
8269,THE LADY ROHESIA.,gone; he was left alone with his departing lady and Beatrice Grey.
8270,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8271,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Sir Guy de Montgomeri stood pensively at the foot of the bed: his arms
8272,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"were crossed upon his bosom, his chin was sunk upon his breast; his"
8273,THE LADY ROHESIA.,eyes were filled with tears; the dim rays of the fading watch-light
8274,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"gave a darker shade to the furrows on his brow, and a brighter tint"
8275,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"to the little bald patch on the top of his head,--for Sir Guy was a"
8276,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"middle-aged gentleman, tall and portly withal, with a slight bend"
8277,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"in his shoulders, but that not much: his complexion was somewhat"
8278,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"florid,--especially about the nose; but his lady was _in extremis_, and"
8279,THE LADY ROHESIA.,at this particular moment he was paler than usual.
8280,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8281,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Bim! bome!"" went the bell. The knight groaned audibly; Beatrice"
8282,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Grey wiped her eye with her little square apron of lace de Malines;
8283,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"there was a moment's pause,--a moment of intense affliction; she"
8284,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"let it fall,--all but one corner, which remained between her finger"
8285,THE LADY ROHESIA.,and thumb.--She looked at Sir Guy; drew the thumb and forefinger
8286,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"of her other hand slowly along its border, till they reached the"
8287,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"opposite extremity. She sobbed aloud: ""So kind a lady!"" said Beatrice"
8288,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Grey.--""So excellent a wife!"" responded Sir Guy. ""So good!"" said the"
8289,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"damsel.--""So dear!"" said the knight.--""So pious!"" said she.--""So"
8290,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"humble!"" said he.--""So good to the poor!""--""So capital a manager!""--""So"
8291,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"punctual at matins!""--""Dinner dished to a moment!""--""So devout!"""
8292,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"said Beatrice.--""So fond of me!"" said Sir Guy.--""And of Father"
8293,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Francis!""--""What the devil do you mean by that?"" said Sir Guy de"
8294,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Montgomeri.
8295,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8296,THE LADY ROHESIA.,The knight and the maiden had rung their antiphonic changes on the fine
8297,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"qualities of the departing Lady, like the _Strophe_ and _Antistrophe_"
8298,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"of a Greek play. The cardinal virtues once disposed of, her minor"
8299,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"excellences came under review:--She would drown a witch, drink"
8300,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"lambs'-wool at Christmas, beg Dominie Dumps's boys a holiday, and dine"
8301,THE LADY ROHESIA.,upon sprats on Good Friday!--A low moan from the subject of these
8302,THE LADY ROHESIA.,eulogies seemed to intimate that the enumeration of her good deeds was
8303,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"not altogether lost on her,--that the parting spirit felt and rejoiced"
8304,THE LADY ROHESIA.,in the testimony.
8305,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8306,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""She was too good for earth!"" continued Sir Guy."
8307,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8308,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Ye-ye-yes!"" sobbed Beatrice."
8309,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8310,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""I did not deserve her!"" said the knight."
8311,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8312,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""No-o-o-o!"" cried the damsel."
8313,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8314,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Not but that I made her an excellent husband, and a kind; but she is"
8315,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"going, and--and--where, or when, or how--shall I get such another?"""
8316,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8317,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Not in broad England--not in the whole wide world!"" responded Beatrice"
8318,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Grey; ""that is, not _just_ such another!""--Her voice still faltered,"
8319,THE LADY ROHESIA.,but her accents on the whole were more articulate; she dropped the
8320,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"corner of her apron, and had recourse to her handkerchief; in fact, her"
8321,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"eyes were getting red,--and so was the tip of her nose."
8322,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8323,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Sir Guy was silent; he gazed for a few moments stedfastly on the face
8324,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"of his lady. The single word ""Another!"" fell from his lips like a"
8325,THE LADY ROHESIA.,distant echo;--it is not often that the viewless nymph repeats more
8326,THE LADY ROHESIA.,than is necessary.
8327,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8328,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Bim! bome!"" went the bell.--Bandy-legged Hubert had been tolling for"
8329,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"half an hour;--he began to grow tired, and St. Peter fidgety."
8330,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8331,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Beatrice Grey!"" said Sir Guy de Montgomeri, ""what's to be done? What's"
8332,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"to become of Montgomeri Hall?--and the buttery,--and the servants? And"
8333,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"what--what's to become of _me_, Beatrice Grey?""--There was pathos in"
8334,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"his tones, and a solemn pause succeeded. ""I'll turn monk myself!"" said"
8335,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Sir Guy.
8336,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8337,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Monk?"" said Beatrice."
8338,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8339,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""I'll be a Carthusian!"" repeated the knight, but in a tone less"
8340,THE LADY ROHESIA.,assured: he relapsed into a reverie.--Shave his head!--he did not so
8341,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"much mind that,--he was getting rather bald already;--but, beans for"
8342,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"dinner,--and those without butter--and then a horse-hair shirt!"
8343,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8344,THE LADY ROHESIA.,The knight seemed undecided: his eye roamed gloomily around the
8345,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"apartment; it paused upon different objects, but as if it saw them"
8346,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"not; its sense was shut, and there was no speculation in its glance:"
8347,THE LADY ROHESIA.,it rested at last upon the fair face of the sympathising damsel at his
8348,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"side, beautiful in her grief."
8349,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8350,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Her tears had ceased; but her eyes were cast down, and mournfully fixed"
8351,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"upon her delicate little foot, which was beating the devil's tattoo."
8352,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8353,THE LADY ROHESIA.,There is no talking to a female when she does not look at you. Sir Guy
8354,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"turned round,--he seated himself on the edge of the bed; and, placing"
8355,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"his hand beneath the chin of the lady, turned up her face in an angle"
8356,THE LADY ROHESIA.,of fifteen degrees.
8357,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8358,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""I don't think I shall take the vows, Beatrice; but what's to become"
8359,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"of me? Poor, miserable, old--that is, poor, miserable, middle-aged man"
8360,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"that I am!--No one to comfort, no one to care for me!""--Beatrice's"
8361,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"tears flowed afresh, but she opened not her lips.--""'Pon my life!"""
8362,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"continued he, ""I don't believe there is a creature now would care a"
8363,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"button if I were hanged to-morrow!"""
8364,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8365,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Oh! don't say so, Sir Guy!"" sighed Beatrice; ""you know"
8366,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"there's--there's Master Everard, and--and Father Francis--"""
8367,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8368,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Pish!"" cried Sir Guy testily."
8369,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8370,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""And--there's your favourite old bitch."""
8371,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8372,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""I am not thinking of old bitches!"" quoth Sir Guy de Montgomeri."
8373,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8374,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Another pause ensued: the knight had released her chin, and taken"
8375,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"her hand;--it was a pretty little hand, with long taper fingers and"
8376,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"filbert-formed nails, and the softness of the palm said little for its"
8377,THE LADY ROHESIA.,owner's industry.
8378,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8379,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Sit down, my dear Beatrice,"" said the knight, thoughtfully; ""you must"
8380,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"be fatigued with your long watching. Take a seat, my child.""--Sir Guy"
8381,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"did not relinquish her hand; but he sidled along the counterpane, and"
8382,THE LADY ROHESIA.,made room for his companion between himself and the bed-post.
8383,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8384,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Now this is a very awkward position for two people to be placed in,"
8385,THE LADY ROHESIA.,especially when the right hand of the one holds the right hand of the
8386,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"other:--in such an attitude, what the deuce can the gentleman do with"
8387,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"his left? Sir Guy closed his till it became an absolute fist, and his"
8388,THE LADY ROHESIA.,knuckles rested on the bed a little in the rear of his companion.
8389,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8390,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Another!"" repeated Sir Guy, musing;--""if, indeed, I could find such"
8391,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"another!""--He was talking to his thought, but Beatrice Grey answered"
8392,THE LADY ROHESIA.,him.
8393,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8394,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""There's Madam Fitzfoozle."""
8395,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8396,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""A frump!"" said Sir Guy."
8397,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8398,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Or the Lady Bumbarton."""
8399,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8400,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""With her hump!"" muttered he."
8401,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8402,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""There's the Dowager--"""
8403,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8404,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""Stop--stop!"" said the knight, ""stop one moment!""--He paused; he was"
8405,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"all on the tremble; something seemed rising in his throat, but he gave"
8406,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"a great gulp, and swallowed it. ""Beatrice,"" said he, ""what think you"
8407,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"of--"" his voice sank into a most seductive softness,--""what think you"
8408,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"of--Beatrice Grey?"""
8409,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8410,THE LADY ROHESIA.,The murder was out:--the knight felt infinitely relieved; the knuckles
8411,THE LADY ROHESIA.,of his left hand unclosed spontaneously; and the arm he had felt such
8412,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"a difficulty in disposing of, found itself,--nobody knows how,--all"
8413,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"at once, encircling the gimp waist of the pretty Beatrice. The young"
8414,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"lady's reply was expressed in three syllables. They were,--""Oh,"
8415,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Sir Guy!"" The words might be somewhat indefinite, but there was no"
8416,THE LADY ROHESIA.,mistaking the look. Their eyes met; Sir Guy's left arm contracted
8417,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"itself spasmodically: when the eyes meet,--at least, as theirs"
8418,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"meet,--the lips are very apt to follow the example. The knight had"
8419,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"taken one long, loving kiss--nectar and ambrosia! He thought on Doctor"
8420,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Butts and his _repetatur haustus_,--a prescription Father Francis had"
8421,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"taken infinite pains to translate for him:--he was about to repeat it,"
8422,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"but the dose was interrupted _in transitu_.--Doubtless the adage,"
8423,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8424,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"""There is many a slip"
8425,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"'Twixt the cup and the lip,"""
8426,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8427,THE LADY ROHESIA.,hath reference to medicine. Sir Guy's lip was again all but in
8428,THE LADY ROHESIA.,conjunction with that of his bride elect.
8429,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8430,THE LADY ROHESIA.,It has been hinted already that there was a little round polished patch
8431,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"on the summit of the knight's _pericranium_, from which his locks had"
8432,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"gradually receded; a sort of _oasis_,--or rather a _Mont Blanc_ in"
8433,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"miniature, rising above the highest point of vegetation. It was on"
8434,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"this little spot, undefended alike by Art and Nature, that at this"
8435,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"interesting moment a blow descended, such as we must borrow a term from"
8436,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"the Sister Island adequately to describe,--it was a ""Whack!"""
8437,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8438,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Sir Guy started upon his feet; Beatrice Grey started upon hers; but
8439,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"a single glance to the rear reversed her position,--she fell upon her"
8440,THE LADY ROHESIA.,knees and screamed.
8441,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8442,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"The knight, too, wheeled about, and beheld a sight which might have"
8443,THE LADY ROHESIA.,turned a bolder man to stone.--It was She!--the all but defunct
8444,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Rohesia--there she sat, bolt upright!--her eyes no longer glazed with"
8445,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"the film of impending dissolution, but scintillating like flint and"
8446,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"steel; while in her hand she grasped the bed-staff,--a weapon of mickle"
8447,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"might, as her husband's bloody coxcomb could now well testify. Words"
8448,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"were yet wanting, for the quinsy, which her rage had broken, still"
8449,THE LADY ROHESIA.,impeded her utterance; but the strength and rapidity of her guttural
8450,THE LADY ROHESIA.,intonations augured well for her future eloquence.
8451,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8452,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Sir Guy de Montgomeri stood for a while like a man distraught; this
8453,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"resurrection--for such it seemed--had quite overpowered him. ""A husband"
8454,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"ofttimes makes the best physician,"" says the proverb; he was a living"
8455,THE LADY ROHESIA.,personification of its truth. Still it was whispered he had been
8456,THE LADY ROHESIA.,content with Doctor Butts; but his lady was restored to bless him for
8457,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"many years.--Heavens, what a life he led!"
8458,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8459,THE LADY ROHESIA.,The Lady Rohesia mended apace; her quinsy was cured; the bell was
8460,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"stopped; and little Hubert, the sacristan, kicked out of the chapelry."
8461,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"St. Peter opened his wicket, and looked out;--there was nobody there;"
8462,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"so he flung-to the gate in a passion, and went back to his lodge,"
8463,THE LADY ROHESIA.,grumbling at being hoaxed by a runaway ring.
8464,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8465,THE LADY ROHESIA.,Years rolled on.--The improvement of Lady Rohesia's temper did not
8466,THE LADY ROHESIA.,keep pace with that of her health; and one fine morning Sir Guy de
8467,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Montgomeri was seen to enter the _porte-cochère_ of Durham House, at"
8468,THE LADY ROHESIA.,that time the town residence of Sir Walter Raleigh. Nothing more was
8469,THE LADY ROHESIA.,ever heard of him; but a boat full of adventurers was known to have
8470,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"dropped down with the tide that evening to Deptford Hope, where lay the"
8471,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"good ship the Darling, commanded by Captain Keymis, who sailed next"
8472,THE LADY ROHESIA.,morning on the Virginia voyage.
8473,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8474,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"A brass plate, some eighteen inches long, may yet be seen in Denton"
8475,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"chancel, let into a broad slab of Bethersden marble; it represents a"
8476,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"lady kneeling, in her wimple and hood; her hands are clasped in prayer,"
8477,THE LADY ROHESIA.,and beneath is an inscription in the characters of the age--

8481,THE LADY ROHESIA.,
8482,THE LADY ROHESIA.,The date is illegible; but it appears that she survived King Henry
8483,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"the Eighth, and that the dissolution of monasteries had lost St. Mary"
8484,THE LADY ROHESIA.,"Rouncival her thousand marks.--As for Beatrice Grey, it is well known"

8504,THE TRAGEDY.,"She had lands and fine houses, and cash in the Bank;"
8505,THE TRAGEDY.,"She had jewels and rings,  And a thousand smart things;"
8506,THE TRAGEDY.,"Was lovely and young,  With a _rather_ sharp tongue,"
8507,THE TRAGEDY.,And she wedded a Noble of high degree
8508,THE TRAGEDY.,With the star of the order of _St. Esprit_;
8509,THE TRAGEDY.,"But the Duke de Guise  Was, by many degrees,"
8510,THE TRAGEDY.,"Her senior, and not very easy to please;"
8511,THE TRAGEDY.,"He'd a sneer on his lip, and a scowl with his eye,"
8512,THE TRAGEDY.,"And a frown on his brow,--and he look'd like a Guy,--"
8513,THE TRAGEDY.,"So she took to intriguing  With Monsieur St. Megrin,"
8514,THE TRAGEDY.,"A young man of fashion, and figure, and worth,"
8515,THE TRAGEDY.,But with no great pretensions to fortune or birth;
8516,THE TRAGEDY.,"He would sing, fence, and dance"
8517,THE TRAGEDY.,"With the best man in France,"
8518,THE TRAGEDY.,And took his rappee with genteel _nonchalance_;
8519,THE TRAGEDY.,"He smiled, and he flatter'd, and flirted with ease,"
8520,THE TRAGEDY.,And was very superior to Monseigneur de Guise.
8521,THE TRAGEDY.,
8522,THE TRAGEDY.,Now Monsieur St. Megrin was curious to know
8523,THE TRAGEDY.,If the Lady approved of his passion or no;
8524,THE TRAGEDY.,"So without more ado,  He put on his _surtout_,"

8542,THE TRAGEDY.,"When,--fancy the shock,--  A loud double knock,"
8543,THE TRAGEDY.,"Made the Lady cry ""Get up, you fool!--there's De Guise!""--"
8544,THE TRAGEDY.,"'Twas his Grace, sure enough;  So Monsieur, looking bluff,"

8565,THE TRAGEDY.,"De Guise grasped her wrist  With his great bony fist,"

10585,CANTO II.,"He's so prone to delude folks, and leave them the lurch in."
10586,CANTO II.,'Twas doubtless his doing  That absolute ruin

10588,CANTO II.,'Tis a subject I don't like to dwell on: but such

10647,CANTO II.,"He'd scarce sleep a wink in  A week; but sit thinking,"
10648,CANTO II.,From company shrinking--  He quite gave up drinking.

10656,CANTO II.,What he used to like best he no longer could bear;

10676,CANTO II.,"While his valet, who often endeavour'd to peep,"

10693,CANTO II.,Count Cordon Bleu  And the Sieur de la Roue
10694,CANTO II.,Confess'd they did _not_ know at all what to do:
10695,CANTO II.,But the Chevalier Hippolyte Hector Achille

10714,CANTO II.,"Hector Achille  Stanislaus Emile,"
10715,CANTO II.,When he heard him talk so felt an odd sort of feel;
10716,CANTO II.,Not that _he_ cared for Ghosts--he was far too genteel;
10717,CANTO II.,Still a queerish sensation came on when he saw
10718,CANTO II.,"Him, whom, for fun,  They'd, by way of a pun"
10719,CANTO II.,"On his person and principles, nick-named _Sans Foi_,"
10720,CANTO II.,"--A man whom they had, you see,  Mark'd as a Sadducee,--"
10721,CANTO II.,"In his horns, all at once, so completely to draw,"
10722,CANTO II.,And to talk of a Ghost with such manifest awe!--
10723,CANTO II.,It excited the Chevalier Grandville's surprise;
10724,CANTO II.,"He shrugg'd up his shoulders, he turn'd up his eyes,"
10725,CANTO II.,And he thought with himself that he could not do less

13093,FYTTE III.,And in lieu of a supper The Knight on his crupper
13094,FYTTE III.,Received the first taste of the Father's _flagellum_;--
13095,FYTTE III.,"That, as chronicles tell, He continued to dwell"
13096,FYTTE III.,"All the rest of his days in the Abbey he'd founded,"

13117,FYTTE III.,"A bare-footed Friar stands behind him, and shakes"
13118,FYTTE III.,"A _flagellum_, whose lashes appear to be snakes;"
13119,FYTTE III.,"While, more terrible still, the astounded beholders"
13120,FYTTE III.,"Perceive the said Friar has NO HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS,"
13121,FYTTE III.,"But is holding his pate In his left hand, out straight,"
13122,FYTTE III.,As if by a closer inspection to find
13123,FYTTE III.,"Where to get the best cut at his victim behind,"
13124,FYTTE III.,"With the aid of a small ""bull's-eye lantern,""--as placed"
13125,FYTTE III.,"By our own New Police,--in a belt round his waist."

13129,FYTTE III.,"In vain,--for the Friar to his skirts closely sticks,"
13130,FYTTE III.,"""Running after him,""--so said the Abbot,--""like Bricks!"""
13131,FYTTE III.,
13132,FYTTE III.,Thrice three times did the Phantom Knight

13135,FYTTE III.,"While his shrieks so piercing made all hearts thrill,--"

13137,FYTTE III.,

13141,FYTTE III.,"With age, and fast mouldering into decay,"
13142,FYTTE III.,Of the structure once built by Sir Ingoldsby Bray;
13143,FYTTE III.,But still there are many folks living who say
13144,FYTTE III.,"That on every Candlemas eve, the Knight,"
13145,FYTTE III.,"Accoutred, and dight In his armour bright,"
13146,FYTTE III.,"With his thick black beard,--and the clerical Sprite,"
13147,FYTTE III.,"With his head in his hand, and his lantern alight,"
13148,FYTTE III.,"Run round the spot where the old Abbey stood,"
13149,FYTTE III.,And are seen in the neighbouring glebe-land and wood;
13150,FYTTE III.,"More especially still, if it's stormy and windy,"
13151,FYTTE III.,You may hear them for miles kicking up their wild shindy
13152,FYTTE III.,"And that once in a gale Of wind, sleet, and hail,"
13153,FYTTE III.,"They frighten'd the horses, and upset the mail."
13154,FYTTE III.,
13155,FYTTE III.,What 'tis breaks the rest Of those souls unblest
13156,FYTTE III.,"Would now be a thing rather hard to be guess'd,"
13157,FYTTE III.,"Though some say the Squire, on his death-bed, confess'd"
13158,FYTTE III.,"That on Ascalon plain, When the bones of the slain"
13159,FYTTE III.,"Were collected that day, and packed up in a chest,"
13160,FYTTE III.,"Caulk'd, and made water-tight,"
13161,FYTTE III.,"By command of the Knight,"
13162,FYTTE III.,"Though the legs and the arms they'd got all pretty right,"
13163,FYTTE III.,"And the body itself in a decentish plight,"
13164,FYTTE III.,Yet the Friar's _Pericranium_ was nowhere in sight;
13165,FYTTE III.,"So, to save themselves trouble, they'd pick'd up instead,"
13166,FYTTE III.,And popp'd on the shoulders a Saracen's Head!
13167,FYTTE III.,"Thus the Knight in the terms of his penance had fail'd,"
13168,FYTTE III.,"And the Pope's absolution, of course, nought avail'd."
13169,FYTTE III.,
13170,FYTTE III.,"Now, though this might be, It don't seem to agree"
13171,FYTTE III.,"With one thing which, I own, is a poser to me,--"
13172,FYTTE III.,"I mean, as the miracles wrought at the shrine"
13173,FYTTE III.,Containing the bones brought from far Palestine
13174,FYTTE III.,"Were so great and notorious, 'tis hard to combine"
13175,FYTTE III.,"This _fact_ with the reason these people assign,"
13176,FYTTE III.,Or suppose that the head of the murder'd Divine
13177,FYTTE III.,"Could be aught but what Yankees would call ""genu-_ine_."""
13178,FYTTE III.,"'Tis a very nice question--but be't as it may,"
13179,FYTTE III.,"The Ghost of Sir Ingoldsby (_ci-devant_ Bray),"
13180,FYTTE III.,"It is boldly affirm'd, by the folks great and small"
13181,FYTTE III.,"About Milton, and Chalk, and around Cobham Hall,"
13182,FYTTE III.,Still on Candlemas-day haunts the old ruin'd wall.
13183,FYTTE III.,"And that many have seem him, and more heard him squall."
13184,FYTTE III.,"So I think, when the facts of the case you recall,"
13185,FYTTE III.,"My inference, reader, you'll fairly forestall,"

14562,A LEGEND OF THANET.,
14563,A LEGEND OF THANET.,"When he arose,  His hands and his clothes"

14808,DE DICETO.,"The Drawbridge is long, but it's down,"

17069,MORAL.,
17070,MORAL.,I think we may coax out a moral or two
17071,MORAL.,From the facts which have lately come under our view.
17072,MORAL.,"First--Don't meddle with Saints!--for you'll find if you do,"
17073,MORAL.,"They're what Scotch people call, ""kittle cattle to shoe!"""
17074,MORAL.,"And when once they have managed to take you in tow,"
17075,MORAL.,It's a deuced hard matter to make them let go!
17076,MORAL.,
17077,MORAL.,"Now to you, wicked Pagans!--who wander about,"
17078,MORAL.,"Up and down Regent Street every night, ""on the scout,""--"
17079,MORAL.,"Recollect the Police keep a sharpish look-out,"
17080,MORAL.,"And, if once you're suspected, your skirts they will stick to,"
17081,MORAL.,Till they catch you at last _in flagrante delicto!_--
17082,MORAL.,Don't the inference draw  That because he of Blois
17083,MORAL.,"Suffer'd _one_ to bilk ""Old father Antic the Law,"""
17084,MORAL.,That _our_ May'rs and _our_ Aldermen--and we've a City full--
17085,MORAL.,"Shew themselves, at _our_ Guildhall, quite so pitiful!"
17086,MORAL.,
17087,MORAL.,"Lastly, as to the Pagan who play'd such a trick,"
17088,MORAL.,"First assuming the tonsure, then cutting his stick,"
17089,MORAL.,There is but one thing which occurs to me--that
17090,MORAL.,"Is,--Don't give too much credit to people who ""rat!"""
17091,MORAL.,--Never forget Early habit's a net
17092,MORAL.,"Which entangles us all, more or less, in its mesh;"
17093,MORAL.,"And ""What's bred in the bone won't come out of the flesh!"""

17095,MORAL.,"We must all be aware Nature's prone to rebel, as"
17096,MORAL.,"Old Juvenal tells us, _Naturam expellas_,"
17097,MORAL.,_Tamen usque recurret_! There's no making Her rat
17098,MORAL.,So that all that I have on this head to advance
17099,MORAL.,"Is,--whatever they think of these matters in France,"
17100,MORAL.,"There's a proverb, the truth of which each one allows here,"

21681,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,Joe remained for a few moments lost in mental abstraction; he looked

21684,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,he got the better of Satan; the half-formed imprecation died before
21685,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,it reached his lips. He looked disdainfully at the wig; it had once
21686,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"been a comely jasey enough, of the colour of over-baked ginger-bread,"
21687,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,one of the description commonly known during the latter half of the

21692,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"_cerebellum_ of some venerated and venerable provost, or judge of"
21693,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,assize; but Mr. Jarvis's wig had one peculiarity; unlike most of its
21694,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"fellows, it had a tail!--""cribbed and confined,"" indeed, by a shabby"
21695,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,piece of faded shalloon.
21696,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21697,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,Washford looked at it again; he shook his bald head; the wig had
21698,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,certainly seen its best days; still it had about it something of
21699,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"an air of faded gentility,--it was ""like ancient Rome, majestic in"
21700,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"decay,""--and as the small ale was not to be forthcoming, why--after"
21701,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"all, an old wig was better than nothing!"
21702,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21703,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"Mr. Jeremiah Jarvis, of Appledore, in the Weald of Kent, was a"
21704,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"gentleman by act of parliament; one of that class of gentlemen who,"
21705,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"disdaining the _bourgeois_-sounding name of ""attorney-at-law,"" are,"
21706,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"by a legal fiction, denominated solicitors. I say by a legal fiction,"
21707,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,for surely the general tenor of the intimation received by such as
21708,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"enjoy the advantage of their correspondence, has little in common with"
21709,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"the idea usually attached to the term ""solicitation."" ""If you don't"
21710,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"pay my bill, and costs, I'll send you to jail,"" is a very energetic"
21711,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"_entreaty_. There are, it is true, etymologists who derive their"
21712,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"style and title from the Latin infinitive ""_solicitare_,"" to ""make"
21713,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"anxious,""--in all probability they are right."
21714,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21715,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"If this be the true etymology of his title, as it was the main end of"
21716,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"his calling, then was Jeremiah Jarvis a worthy exemplar of the _genus_"
21717,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,to which he belonged. Few persons in his time had created greater
21718,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"solicitude among his Majesty's lieges within the ""Weald."" He was rich,"
21719,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"of course. The best house in the country-town is always the lawyer's,"
21720,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"and it generally boasts a green door, stone steps, and a brass knocker."
21721,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,In neither of these appendages to opulence was Jeremiah deficient; but
21722,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"then, he was so _very_ rich; his reputed wealth, indeed, passed all the"
21723,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"common modes of accounting for its increase. True, he was so universal"
21724,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,a favourite that every man whose will he made was sure to leave him a
21725,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,legacy; that he was a sort of general assignee to all the bankruptcies
21726,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"within twenty miles of Appledore; was clerk to half the ""trusts;"" and"
21727,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"treasurer to most of the ""rates,"" ""funds,"" and ""subscriptions,"" in that"
21728,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"part of the country; that he was land-agent to Lord Mountrhino, and"
21729,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,steward to the rich Miss Tabbytale of Smerrididdle Hall! that he had
21730,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"been guardian (?) to three young profligates, who all ran through their"
21731,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"property, which, somehow or another, came at last into his hands, ""at"
21732,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"an equitable valuation."" Still his possessions were so considerable,"
21733,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"as not to be altogether accounted for, in vulgar esteem, even by"
21734,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,these and other honourable modes of accumulation; nor were there
21735,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,wanting those who conscientiously entertained a belief that a certain
21736,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"dark-coloured gentleman, of indifferent character, known principally by"
21737,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"his predilection for appearing in perpetual mourning, had been through"
21738,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"life his great friend and counsellor, and had mainly assisted in the"
21739,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"acquirement of his revenues. That ""old Jerry Jarvis had sold himself"
21740,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"to the devil"" was, indeed, a dogma which it were heresy to doubt in"
21741,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"Appledore;--on this head, at least, there were few schismatics in the"
21742,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,parish.
21743,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21744,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"When the worthy ""Solicitor"" next looked out of his ground-floor back,"
21745,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,he smiled with much complacency at beholding Joe Washford again hard at
21746,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,work--in his wig--the little tail aforesaid oscillating like a pendulum
21747,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"in the breeze. If it be asked what could induce a gentleman, whose"
21748,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"leading principle seems to have been self-appropriation, to make so"
21749,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"magnificent a present, the answer is, that Mr. Jarvis might, perhaps,"
21750,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,have thought an occasional act of benevolence necessary or politic; he
21751,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"is not the only person, who, having stolen a quantity of leather, has"
21752,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"given away a pair of shoes, _pour l'amour de Dieu_,--perhaps he had"
21753,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,other motives.
21754,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21755,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"Joe, meanwhile, worked away at the celery bed; but truth obliges us"
21756,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"to say, neither with the same degree of vigour or perseverance as"
21757,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,had marked the earlier efforts of the morning. His pauses were more
21758,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,frequent; he rested longer on the handle of his spade; while ever and
21759,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,anon his eye would wander from the trench beneath him to an object
21760,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,not unworthy the contemplation of a natural philosopher. This was an
21761,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,apple-tree.
21762,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21763,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"Fairer fruit never tempted Eve, or any of her daughters; the bending"
21764,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"branches groaned beneath their luxuriant freight, and, drooping to"
21765,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"earth, seemed to ask the protecting aid of man either to support or"
21766,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"to relieve them. The fine, rich glow of their sun-streaked clusters"
21767,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,derived additional loveliness from the level beams of the descending
21768,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,day-star. An anchorite's mouth had watered at the pippins.

21770,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"On the precise graft of the espalier of Eden, ""Sanchoniathon, Manetho,"

21774,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"attracted the optics, and discomposed the inner man of the thirsty,"
21775,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"patient, but perspiring gardener. The heat was still oppressive; no"
21776,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"beer had moistened his lip, though its very name, uttered as it was"
21777,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"in the ungracious tones of a Witherspoon, had left behind a longing"
21778,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"as intense as fruitless. His thirst seemed supernatural, when at this"
21779,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"moment his left ear experienced ""a slight and tickling sensation,"" such"
21780,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,as we are assured is occasionally produced by an infinitesimal dose in
21781,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"homœopathy; a still, small _voice_--it was as though a daddy-long-legs"
21782,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"were whispering in his _tympanum_--a small _voice_ seemed to say,"
21783,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"""Joe!--take an apple, Joe!!"""
21784,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21785,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,Honest Joseph started at the suggestion; the rich crimson of his
21786,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,jolly nose deepened to a purple tint in the beams of the setting sun;
21787,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,his very forehead was incarnadine. He raised his hand to scratch his
21788,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"ear,--the little tortuous tail had worked its way into it,--he pulled"
21789,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"it out by the bit of shalloon, and allayed the itching, then cast his"
21790,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,eye wistfully towards the mansion where his master was sitting by the
21791,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"open window. Joe pursed up his parched lips into an arid whistle, and"
21792,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,with a desperate energy struck his spade once more into the celery-bed.
21793,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21794,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,Alack! alack! what a piece of work is man!--how short his
21795,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,triumphs!--how frail his resolutions!
21796,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21797,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,From this fine and very original moral reflection we turn reluctantly
21798,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"to record the sequel. The celery-bed, alluded to as the main scene"
21799,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"of Mr. Washford's operations, was drawn in a rectilinear direction,"
21800,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,nearly across the whole breadth of the parallelogram that comprised
21801,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"the ""kitchen garden."" Its northern extremity abutted to the hedge"
21802,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"before mentioned, its southern one--woe is me that it should have"
21803,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,been so!--was in fearful vicinity to the Ribstone pippin-tree. One
21804,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"branch, low bowed to earth, seemed ready to discharge its precious"
21805,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,burden into the very trench. As Joseph stooped to insert the last plant
21806,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"with his dibble, an apple of more than ordinary beauty bobbed against"
21807,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"his knuckles.--""He's taking snuff, Joe,"" whispered the same small"
21808,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"_voice_;--the tail had twisted itself into its old position. ""He is"
21809,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"sneezing!--now, Joe!--now!"" And, ere the agitated horticulturist could"
21810,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"recover from his surprise and alarm, the fruit was severed, and--in his"
21811,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,hand!
21812,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21813,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"""He! he! he!"" shrilly laughed, or seemed to laugh, that accursed little"
21814,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,pigtail.--Washford started at once to the perpendicular;--with an
21815,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"enfrenzied grasp he tore the jasey from his head, and, with that in one"
21816,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"hand, and his ill-acquired spoil in the other, he rushed distractedly"
21817,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,from the garden!

21820,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21821,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,All that night was the humble couch of the once happy gardener haunted
21822,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"with the most fearful visions. He was stealing apples,--he was robbing"
21823,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"hen-roosts,--he was altering the chalks upon the milk-score,--he had"
21824,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"purloined three _chemises_ from a hedge, and he awoke in the very"
21825,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,act of cutting the throat of one of Squire Hodge's sheep! A clammy
21826,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"dew stood upon his temples,--the cold perspiration burst from every"
21827,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"pore,--he sprang in terror from the bed."

21833,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21834,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,A long-drawn sigh was her husband's only answer; his eye fell upon the

21849,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,when Joseph Washford once more repaired to the scene of his daily
21850,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"labours; a sort of unpleasant consciousness flushed his countenance,"
21851,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"and gave him an uneasy feeling as he opened the garden gate; for Joe,"
21852,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"generally speaking, was honest as the skin between his eyebrows;--his"
21853,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"hand faltered as it pressed the latch. ""Pooh, pooh! 'twas but an apple,"
21854,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"after all!"" said Joseph. He pushed open the wicket, and found himself"
21855,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,beneath the tempting tree.
21856,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21857,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,But vain now were all its fascinations; like fairy gold seen by the

21859,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"say nothing of apples, which in shape resemble them, would not have"
21860,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,bought him to stretch forth an unhallowed hand again. He went steadily
21861,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,to his work.
21862,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21863,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"The day continued cloudy, huge drops of rain fell at intervals,"
21864,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,stamping his bald pate with spots as big as halfpence; but Joseph
21865,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"worked on. As the day advanced, showers fell thick and frequent; the"
21866,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,fresh-turned earth was itself fragrant as a _bouquet_.--Joseph worked
21867,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"on--and when at last _Jupiter Pluvius_ descended in all his majesty,"
21868,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"soaking the ground into the consistency of a dingy pudding, he put"
21869,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"on his party-coloured jacket, and strode towards his humble home,"
21870,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"rejoicing in his renewed integrity. ""'Twas but an apple, after all! Had"

21872,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21873,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"""An apple-pie!""--the thought was a dangerous one--too dangerous to"
21874,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,dwell on. But Joseph's better Genius was at this time lord of the

21880,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"clattered on the red-tiled floor, and she whisked about the house"
21881,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"like a parched pea upon a drum-head; her voice, generally small and"
21882,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"low,--""an excellent thing in woman,""--was pitched at least an octave"
21883,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,above its ordinary level; she was talking fast and furious. Something
21884,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"had evidently gone wrong. The mystery was soon explained. The ""_cussed"

21886,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,from the only pan their single cow had filled that morning! And there
21887,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"she now lay,--purring as in scorn,--Tib, heretofore the meekest of"
21888,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"mousers, the honestest, the least ""_scaddle_"" of the feline race,--a"
21889,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,cat that one would have sworn might have been trusted with untold
21890,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"fish,--yes,--there was no denying it,--proofs were too strong against"
21891,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"her,--yet there she lay, hardened in her iniquity, coolly licking her"

21898,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"Never was cat so astonished,--so enraged--all the tiger portion"

21901,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"Grimalkin would unquestionably have done under similar circumstances,"
21902,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"she paused a moment,--drew back on her haunches,--all her energies"
21903,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,seemed concentrated for one prodigious spring; a demoniac fire gleamed
21904,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"in her green and yellow eyeballs, as, bounding upwards, she fixed her"
21905,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,talons firmly in each of her assailant's cheeks!--many and many a day
21906,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"after were sadly visible the marks of those envenomed claws,--then,"
21907,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"dashing over his shoulder with an unearthly mew, she leaped through the"

21909,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21910,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"""The Devil's in the cat!"" was the apostrophe of Mrs. Margaret Washford."

21914,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"Day after day, night after night, 'twas all the same--Joe Washford's"
21915,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,life became a burden to him; his natural upright and honest mind
21916,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,struggled hard against the frailty of human nature. He was ever
21917,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"restless and uneasy; his frank, open, manly look, that blenched not"
21918,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"from the gaze of the spectator, was no more; a sly and sinister"

21920,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21921,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"Mr. Jeremiah Jarvis had little of what the world calls ""Taste,"" still"

21926,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,cultivation and cookery the respective talents of Joe and Madame

21928,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"37 was ""the only one fit for a gentleman's nose."" And yet, after all,"
21929,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,Jerry Jarvis had a good-looking tulip-bed. A female friend of his had
21930,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,married a Dutch merchant; Jerry drew the settlements; the lady paid

21941,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"among them of such brilliant, such surpassing beauty,--the ""cups"" so"
21942,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"well formed,--the colours so defined. To be sure, Mr. Jenkinson had"
21943,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"enough in his own garden; but then ""Enough,"" says the philosopher,"
21944,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"""always means a little more than a man has got.""--Alas! alas! Jerry"
21945,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"Jarvis was never known to _bestow_,--his neighbour dared not offer to"

21948,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21949,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,Joseph Washford was working away again in the blaze of the mid-day sun;

21951,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,
21952,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,"""Why, where's your wig, Joseph?"" said the voice of his master from the"

21960,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,

21968,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,Washford's heart smote him: he felt all that was implied in his

21970,A LEGEND OF THE WEALD OF KENT.,taken it off because we have had a smartish shower; but the sky is
