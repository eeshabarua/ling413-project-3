328,AFTER SIXTY YEARS,"Care and a crown, sorrow and sovereignty."
329,AFTER SIXTY YEARS,
330,AFTER SIXTY YEARS,But from our hearts sprang an intenser flame
331,AFTER SIXTY YEARS,"When loyal Love met tender Love half way,"
332,AFTER SIXTY YEARS,"And, in love’s script, wrote on the scroll of fame,"
333,AFTER SIXTY YEARS,"Entwined with all the splendour of that day,"

671,[JUNE 18],"England, wanton and weary, sunk in a slothful ease,"

680,[JUNE 18],"For valour and faith and honour--these grow where the red flower grows,"
681,[JUNE 18],And the leaves for the Nation’s healing must spring from
682,[JUNE 18],the blood of her foes.

721,TO THE QUEEN,"Sons of her heart, whom England holdeth dear,"

728,TO THE QUEEN,
729,TO THE QUEEN,"Her robe is woven of glory and renown,"

743,TO THE QUEEN,"England, our Mother, in her heart holds still,"
744,TO THE QUEEN,"As her most precious jewel, save only one,"

747,TO THE QUEEN,"Through the long agony of strenuous years,"
748,TO THE QUEEN,"Made pure by blood and sanctified by tears,"

758,TO THE QUEEN,"Of every man who has our English tongue,"

768,TO THE QUEEN,Were honour outcast from her supreme place

808,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"Her eyes were blue as cornflowers are,"
809,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,Her hair was gold like corn.
810,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,
811,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,Sir Geoffrey gave the white lady
812,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"A posy of roses seven,"
813,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"“You are the fairest May,” said he,"
814,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“That ever strayed from Heaven.”
815,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,
816,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,Sir Geoffrey by the white lady
817,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"Was lured away to shame,"

819,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,No tidings of him came.
820,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,
821,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,Then she who should have been his bride

826,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“Since God and all the saints of Heaven
827,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"Bring not my lord to me,"

835,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"And there Sir Geoffrey lay asleep,"
836,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,And the white witch sat by him.
837,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,
838,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"Her arm was laid across his neck,"
839,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"Her gold hair on his face,"
840,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,And there was silence in the room
841,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,As in a burial-place.
842,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,
843,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"And there were gems and carven cups,"
844,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,And ’broidered bridal gear--
845,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"“Whose bridal is this?” the lady said,"
846,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“And what knight have ye here?”

863,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“I would think scorn to take the half

876,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,And both fare forth with me;
877,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“For I have learned a spell more strong
878,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"Than yours that laid him low,"
879,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,And I will speak it for his sake

887,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“I have been brave to hold him here
888,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"While seven long years befell,"
889,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,Rather than let a bridal be
890,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,Whose seed should flower in hell.
891,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,
892,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“I have not looked into his eyes

900,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,Because I love him so.
901,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,
902,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“But since his soul this seven year

904,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“His body and soul to-night shall lie

910,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,And take his soul from thee.”
911,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,
912,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"She stooped above him where he lay,"
913,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,She laid her lips on his;
914,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,"He stirred, he spake: “These seven long years"
915,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,I have waited for thy kiss.
916,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,
917,THE BALLAD OF THE WHITE LADY,“My soul has hung upon thy lips

934,THE GHOST BEREFT,And passed down the old dear road again.
935,THE GHOST BEREFT,
936,THE GHOST BEREFT,"Thin cowered the hedges, the tall trees swayed"
937,THE GHOST BEREFT,Like little children that shrank afraid.
938,THE GHOST BEREFT,
939,THE GHOST BEREFT,The wind was wild and the night was late
940,THE GHOST BEREFT,When the poor ghost came to the garden gate;
941,THE GHOST BEREFT,
942,THE GHOST BEREFT,"Dank were the flower-beds, heavy and wet,"
943,THE GHOST BEREFT,The weeds stood up where the rose was set.
944,THE GHOST BEREFT,
945,THE GHOST BEREFT,"The wind was angry, the rain beat sore"
946,THE GHOST BEREFT,When the poor ghost came to its own house-door.
947,THE GHOST BEREFT,
948,THE GHOST BEREFT,“And shall I find her a-weeping still
949,THE GHOST BEREFT,To think how alone I lie and chill?
950,THE GHOST BEREFT,
951,THE GHOST BEREFT,“Or shall I find her happy and warm
952,THE GHOST BEREFT,With her dear head laid on a new love’s arm?
953,THE GHOST BEREFT,
954,THE GHOST BEREFT,“Or shall I find she has learned to pine
955,THE GHOST BEREFT,"For another’s love, and not for mine?"
956,THE GHOST BEREFT,
957,THE GHOST BEREFT,"“Whatever chance, I have this to my store,"
958,THE GHOST BEREFT,"She is mine, my own, for evermore!”"
959,THE GHOST BEREFT,
960,THE GHOST BEREFT,So the poor ghost came through the wind and rain
961,THE GHOST BEREFT,Till it reached the square bright window pane.
962,THE GHOST BEREFT,
963,THE GHOST BEREFT,“Oh! what is here in the room so bright?
964,THE GHOST BEREFT,"Roses and love, and a hid delight?"
965,THE GHOST BEREFT,
966,THE GHOST BEREFT,“What lurks in the silence that fills the room?
967,THE GHOST BEREFT,A cypress wreath from a dead man’s tomb?
968,THE GHOST BEREFT,
969,THE GHOST BEREFT,“What sleeps? What wakes? And oh! can it be
970,THE GHOST BEREFT,Her heart that is breaking--and not for me?”
971,THE GHOST BEREFT,
972,THE GHOST BEREFT,"Then the poor ghost looked through the window pane,"
973,THE GHOST BEREFT,Though all the glass was wrinkled with rain.
974,THE GHOST BEREFT,
975,THE GHOST BEREFT,"“Oh, there is light, at the feet and head"
976,THE GHOST BEREFT,Twelve tall tapers about the bed.
977,THE GHOST BEREFT,
978,THE GHOST BEREFT,"“Oh, there are flowers, white flowers and rare,"
979,THE GHOST BEREFT,But not the garland a bride may wear.
980,THE GHOST BEREFT,
981,THE GHOST BEREFT,"“Jasmine white and a white white rose,"
982,THE GHOST BEREFT,But its scent is gone where the lost dream goes.
983,THE GHOST BEREFT,
984,THE GHOST BEREFT,“Straight lilies laid on the strait white bier--
985,THE GHOST BEREFT,But the room is empty--she is not here!
986,THE GHOST BEREFT,
987,THE GHOST BEREFT,"“Her body lies here, deserted, cold;"
988,THE GHOST BEREFT,And the body that loved it creeps in the mould.
989,THE GHOST BEREFT,
990,THE GHOST BEREFT,"“Was there ever an hour when my Love, set free,"
991,THE GHOST BEREFT,Would not have hastened and come to me?

1030,THE VAIN SPELL,"“Oh, will you not come to me, Love, to-night?"
1031,THE VAIN SPELL,"I have waited the whole night through,"
1032,THE VAIN SPELL,"For I knew,"
1033,THE VAIN SPELL,"O Heart of my heart, I knew by my heart,"
1034,THE VAIN SPELL,"That the night of all nights is this,"
1035,THE VAIN SPELL,"When elm shall crack and lead shall part,"

1037,THE VAIN SPELL,To let you through to my kiss.”
1038,THE VAIN SPELL,
1039,THE VAIN SPELL,So spake she alone in the lonely house.
1040,THE VAIN SPELL,"She had wrapped her round with the spell,"
1041,THE VAIN SPELL,"She called the call, she vowed the vow,"
1042,THE VAIN SPELL,And the heart she had pledged knew well
1043,THE VAIN SPELL,"That this was the night, the only night,"
1044,THE VAIN SPELL,"When the moulds might be wrenched apart,"
1045,THE VAIN SPELL,"When the living and dead, in the dead of the night,"

1047,THE VAIN SPELL,For the price of a living heart.
1048,THE VAIN SPELL,

1052,THE VAIN SPELL,"I have waited the whole night through,"
1053,THE VAIN SPELL,For I knew

1059,THE VAIN SPELL,
1060,THE VAIN SPELL,The moon grows pale and the house sleeps still;
1061,THE VAIN SPELL,"Ah, God! do the dead forget?"

1509,DISCRETION,Until once more Love smiled my way
1510,DISCRETION,"And fooled me once again,"
1511,DISCRETION,And taught me grief again.
1512,DISCRETION,
1513,DISCRETION,Now I will gather no more grief;
1514,DISCRETION,"I only ask to see the sky,"
1515,DISCRETION,"The budding flower, the budding leaf,"
1516,DISCRETION,"And put old dreamings by,"
1517,DISCRETION,The dreams Love tortures by.
1518,DISCRETION,
1519,DISCRETION,"For, being wise, I love no more;"
1520,DISCRETION,"You, if you will, snare with those eyes"

2827,2 WHITEHALL GARDENS WESTMINSTER,with novels which deal exclusively with Indians and Anglo-Indians.
2828,2 WHITEHALL GARDENS WESTMINSTER,Such powerful and remarkable books as ‘The Potter’s Thumb’ and ‘On
2829,2 WHITEHALL GARDENS WESTMINSTER,"the Face of the Waters,’ point to a specialism which is becoming"
2830,2 WHITEHALL GARDENS WESTMINSTER,one of the salient features of modern fiction; but ‘In the
2831,2 WHITEHALL GARDENS WESTMINSTER,"Tideway,’ although dealing entirely with England and Scotland,"
2832,2 WHITEHALL GARDENS WESTMINSTER,"presents the same keen and unerring grasp of character, the same"

2834,2 WHITEHALL GARDENS WESTMINSTER,"for creating strong and dramatic situations, and the same"
2835,2 WHITEHALL GARDENS WESTMINSTER,originality of thought and expression.... It is too late in the day
