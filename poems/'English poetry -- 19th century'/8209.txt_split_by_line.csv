67,STORY OF RIMINI.,STORY OF RIMINI.
68,STORY OF RIMINI.,
69,STORY OF RIMINI.,
70,STORY OF RIMINI.,
71,STORY OF RIMINI.,"I stood tip-toe upon a little hill,"
72,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The air was cooling, and so very still."
73,STORY OF RIMINI.,That the sweet buds which with a modest pride
74,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,"
75,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems,"
76,STORY OF RIMINI.,Had not yet lost those starry diadems
77,STORY OF RIMINI.,Caught from the early sobbing of the morn.
78,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn,"
79,STORY OF RIMINI.,And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept
80,STORY OF RIMINI.,"On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept"
81,STORY OF RIMINI.,"A little noiseless noise among the leaves,"
82,STORY OF RIMINI.,Born of the very sigh that silence heaves:
83,STORY OF RIMINI.,For not the faintest motion could be seen
84,STORY OF RIMINI.,Of all the shades that slanted o'er the green.
85,STORY OF RIMINI.,"There was wide wand'ring for the greediest eye,"
86,STORY OF RIMINI.,To peer about upon variety;
87,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Far round the horizon's crystal air to skim,"
88,STORY OF RIMINI.,And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim;
89,STORY OF RIMINI.,"To picture out the quaint, and curious bending"
90,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Of a fresh woodland alley, never ending;"
91,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves,"
92,STORY OF RIMINI.,Guess were the jaunty streams refresh themselves.
93,STORY OF RIMINI.,"I gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free"
94,STORY OF RIMINI.,As though the fanning wings of Mercury
95,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Had played upon my heels: I was light-hearted,"
96,STORY OF RIMINI.,And many pleasures to my vision started;
97,STORY OF RIMINI.,So I straightway began to pluck a posey
98,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy."
99,STORY OF RIMINI.,
100,STORY OF RIMINI.,A bush of May flowers with the bees about them;
101,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them;"
102,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And let a lush laburnum oversweep them,"
103,STORY OF RIMINI.,And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them
104,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Moist, cool and green; and shade the violets,"
105,STORY OF RIMINI.,That they may bind the moss in leafy nets.
106,STORY OF RIMINI.,
107,STORY OF RIMINI.,"A filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined,"
108,STORY OF RIMINI.,And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind
109,STORY OF RIMINI.,Upon their summer thrones; there too should be
110,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The frequent chequer of a youngling tree,"
111,STORY OF RIMINI.,That with a score of light green brethen shoots
112,STORY OF RIMINI.,From the quaint mossiness of aged roots:
113,STORY OF RIMINI.,Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters
114,STORY OF RIMINI.,Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters
115,STORY OF RIMINI.,The spreading blue bells: it may haply mourn
116,STORY OF RIMINI.,That such fair clusters should be rudely torn
117,STORY OF RIMINI.,"From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly"
118,STORY OF RIMINI.,"By infant hands, left on the path to die."
119,STORY OF RIMINI.,
120,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Open afresh your round of starry folds,"
121,STORY OF RIMINI.,Ye ardent marigolds!
122,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Dry up the moisture from your golden lids,"
123,STORY OF RIMINI.,For great Apollo bids
124,STORY OF RIMINI.,That in these days your praises should be sung
125,STORY OF RIMINI.,"On many harps, which he has lately strung;"
126,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And when again your dewiness he kisses,"
127,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses:"
128,STORY OF RIMINI.,"So haply when I rove in some far vale,"
129,STORY OF RIMINI.,His mighty voice may come upon the gale.
130,STORY OF RIMINI.,
131,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight:"
132,STORY OF RIMINI.,"With wings of gentle flush o'er delicate white,"
133,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And taper fulgent catching at all things,"
134,STORY OF RIMINI.,To bind them all about with tiny rings.
135,STORY OF RIMINI.,
136,STORY OF RIMINI.,Linger awhile upon some bending planks
137,STORY OF RIMINI.,"That lean against a streamlet's rushy banks,"
138,STORY OF RIMINI.,And watch intently Nature's gentle doings:
139,STORY OF RIMINI.,They will be found softer than ring-dove's cooings.
140,STORY OF RIMINI.,How silent comes the water round that bend;
141,STORY OF RIMINI.,Not the minutest whisper does it send
142,STORY OF RIMINI.,To the o'erhanging sallows: blades of grass
143,STORY OF RIMINI.,Slowly across the chequer'd shadows pass.
144,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach"
145,STORY OF RIMINI.,To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach
146,STORY OF RIMINI.,A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds;
147,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Where swarms of minnows show their little heads,"
148,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Staying their wavy bodies 'gainst the streams,"
149,STORY OF RIMINI.,To taste the luxury of sunny beams
150,STORY OF RIMINI.,Temper'd with coolness. How they ever wrestle
151,STORY OF RIMINI.,"With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle"
152,STORY OF RIMINI.,Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand.
153,STORY OF RIMINI.,"If you but scantily hold out the hand,"
154,STORY OF RIMINI.,That very instant not one will remain;
155,STORY OF RIMINI.,"But turn your eye, and they are there again."
156,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses,"
157,STORY OF RIMINI.,And cool themselves among the em'rald tresses;
158,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The while they cool themselves, they freshness give,"
159,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And moisture, that the bowery green may live:"
160,STORY OF RIMINI.,"So keeping up an interchange of favours,"
161,STORY OF RIMINI.,Like good men in the truth of their behaviours
162,STORY OF RIMINI.,Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop
163,STORY OF RIMINI.,From low hung branches; little space they stop;
164,STORY OF RIMINI.,"But sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek;"
165,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Then off at once, as in a wanton freak:"
166,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Or perhaps, to show their black, and golden wings,"
167,STORY OF RIMINI.,Pausing upon their yellow flutterings.
168,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Were I in such a place, I sure should pray"
169,STORY OF RIMINI.,"That nought less sweet, might call my thoughts away,"
170,STORY OF RIMINI.,Than the soft rustle of a maiden's gown
171,STORY OF RIMINI.,Fanning away the dandelion's down;
172,STORY OF RIMINI.,Than the light music of her nimble toes
173,STORY OF RIMINI.,Patting against the sorrel as she goes.
174,STORY OF RIMINI.,"How she would start, and blush, thus to be caught"
175,STORY OF RIMINI.,Playing in all her innocence of thought.
176,STORY OF RIMINI.,"O let me lead her gently o'er the brook,"
177,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Watch her half-smiling lips, and downward look;"
178,STORY OF RIMINI.,O let me for one moment touch her wrist;
179,STORY OF RIMINI.,Let me one moment to her breathing list;
180,STORY OF RIMINI.,And as she leaves me may she often turn
181,STORY OF RIMINI.,Her fair eyes looking through her locks auburne.
182,STORY OF RIMINI.,"What next? A tuft of evening primroses,"
183,STORY OF RIMINI.,O'er which the mind may hover till it dozes;
184,STORY OF RIMINI.,"O'er which it well might take a pleasant sleep,"
185,STORY OF RIMINI.,But that 'tis ever startled by the leap
186,STORY OF RIMINI.,Of buds into ripe flowers; or by the flitting
187,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting;"
188,STORY OF RIMINI.,Or by the moon lifting her silver rim
189,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Above a cloud, and with a gradual swim"
190,STORY OF RIMINI.,Coming into the blue with all her light.
191,STORY OF RIMINI.,"O Maker of sweet poets, dear delight"
192,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Of this fair world, and all its gentle livers;"
193,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Spangler of clouds, halo of crystal rivers,"
194,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Mingler with leaves, and dew and tumbling streams,"
195,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Closer of lovely eyes to lovely dreams,"
196,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Lover of loneliness, and wandering,"
197,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Of upcast eye, and tender pondering!"
198,STORY OF RIMINI.,Thee must I praise above all other glories
199,STORY OF RIMINI.,That smile us on to tell delightful stories.
200,STORY OF RIMINI.,For what has made the sage or poet write
201,STORY OF RIMINI.,But the fair paradise of Nature's light?
202,STORY OF RIMINI.,"In the calm grandeur of a sober line,"
203,STORY OF RIMINI.,We see the waving of the mountain pine;
204,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And when a tale is beautifully staid,"
205,STORY OF RIMINI.,We feel the safety of a hawthorn glade:
206,STORY OF RIMINI.,"When it is moving on luxurious wings,"
207,STORY OF RIMINI.,The soul is lost in pleasant smotherings:
208,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Fair dewy roses brush against our faces,"
209,STORY OF RIMINI.,And flowering laurels spring from diamond vases;
210,STORY OF RIMINI.,"O'er head we see the jasmine and sweet briar,"
211,STORY OF RIMINI.,And bloomy grapes laughing from green attire;
212,STORY OF RIMINI.,"While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles"
213,STORY OF RIMINI.,Charms us at once away from all our troubles:
214,STORY OF RIMINI.,"So that we feel uplifted from the world,"
215,STORY OF RIMINI.,Walking upon the white clouds wreath'd and curl'd.
216,STORY OF RIMINI.,"So felt he, who first told, how Psyche went"
217,STORY OF RIMINI.,On the smooth wind to realms of wonderment;
218,STORY OF RIMINI.,"What Psyche felt, and Love, when their full lips"
219,STORY OF RIMINI.,"First touch'd; what amorous, and fondling nips"
220,STORY OF RIMINI.,"They gave each other's cheeks; with all their sighs,"
221,STORY OF RIMINI.,And how they kist each other's tremulous eyes:
222,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The silver lamp,--the ravishment,--the wonder--"
223,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The darkness,--loneliness,--the fearful thunder;"
224,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Their woes gone by, and both to heaven upflown,"
225,STORY OF RIMINI.,To bow for gratitude before Jove's throne.
226,STORY OF RIMINI.,"So did he feel, who pull'd the boughs aside,"
227,STORY OF RIMINI.,"That we might look into a forest wide,"
228,STORY OF RIMINI.,"To catch a glimpse of Fawns, and Dryades"
229,STORY OF RIMINI.,Coming with softest rustle through the trees;
230,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And garlands woven of flowers wild, and sweet,"
231,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Upheld on ivory wrists, or sporting feet:"
232,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Telling us how fair, trembling Syrinx fled"
233,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Arcadian Pan, with such a fearful dread."
234,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Poor nymph,--poor Pan,--how he did weep to find,"
235,STORY OF RIMINI.,Nought but a lovely sighing of the wind
236,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Along the reedy stream; a half heard strain,"
237,STORY OF RIMINI.,Full of sweet desolation--balmy pain.
238,STORY OF RIMINI.,
239,STORY OF RIMINI.,What first inspired a bard of old to sing
240,STORY OF RIMINI.,Narcissus pining o'er the untainted spring?
241,STORY OF RIMINI.,"In some delicious ramble, he had found"
242,STORY OF RIMINI.,"A little space, with boughs all woven round;"
243,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And in the midst of all, a clearer pool"
244,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Than e'er reflected in its pleasant cool,"
245,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The blue sky here, and there, serenely peeping"
246,STORY OF RIMINI.,Through tendril wreaths fantastically creeping.
247,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And on the bank a lonely flower he spied,"
248,STORY OF RIMINI.,"A meek and forlorn flower, with naught of pride,"
249,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Drooping its beauty o'er the watery clearness,"
250,STORY OF RIMINI.,To woo its own sad image into nearness:
251,STORY OF RIMINI.,Deaf to light Zephyrus it would not move;
252,STORY OF RIMINI.,"But still would seem to droop, to pine, to love."
253,STORY OF RIMINI.,"So while the Poet stood in this sweet spot,"
254,STORY OF RIMINI.,Some fainter gleamings o'er his fancy shot;
255,STORY OF RIMINI.,Nor was it long ere he had told the tale
256,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Of young Narcissus, and sad Echo's bale."
257,STORY OF RIMINI.,
258,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew"
259,STORY OF RIMINI.,"That sweetest of all songs, that ever new,"
260,STORY OF RIMINI.,"That aye refreshing, pure deliciousness,"
261,STORY OF RIMINI.,Coming ever to bless
262,STORY OF RIMINI.,The wanderer by moonlight? to him bringing
263,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Shapes from the invisible world, unearthly singing"
264,STORY OF RIMINI.,"From out the middle air, from flowery nests,"
265,STORY OF RIMINI.,And from the pillowy silkiness that rests
266,STORY OF RIMINI.,Full in the speculation of the stars.
267,STORY OF RIMINI.,Ah! surely he had burst our mortal bars;
268,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Into some wond'rous region he had gone,"
269,STORY OF RIMINI.,"To search for thee, divine Endymion!"
270,STORY OF RIMINI.,
271,STORY OF RIMINI.,"He was a Poet, sure a lover too,"
272,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Who stood on Latmus' top, what time there blew"
273,STORY OF RIMINI.,Soft breezes from the myrtle vale below;
274,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And brought in faintness solemn, sweet, and slow"
275,STORY OF RIMINI.,"A hymn from Dian's temple; while upswelling,"
276,STORY OF RIMINI.,The incense went to her own starry dwelling.
277,STORY OF RIMINI.,"But though her face was clear as infant's eyes,"
278,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Though she stood smiling o'er the sacrifice,"
279,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The Poet wept at her so piteous fate,"
280,STORY OF RIMINI.,Wept that such beauty should be desolate:
281,STORY OF RIMINI.,"So in fine wrath some golden sounds he won,"
282,STORY OF RIMINI.,And gave meek Cynthia her Endymion.
283,STORY OF RIMINI.,
284,STORY OF RIMINI.,Queen of the wide air; thou most lovely queen
285,STORY OF RIMINI.,Of all the brightness that mine eyes have seen!
286,STORY OF RIMINI.,"As thou exceedest all things in thy shine,"
287,STORY OF RIMINI.,"So every tale, does this sweet tale of thine."
288,STORY OF RIMINI.,"O for three words of honey, that I might"
289,STORY OF RIMINI.,Tell but one wonder of thy bridal night!
290,STORY OF RIMINI.,
291,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Where distant ships do seem to show their keels,"
292,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Phoebus awhile delayed his mighty wheels,"
293,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes,"
294,STORY OF RIMINI.,Ere he his unseen pomp would solemnize.
295,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The evening weather was so bright, and clear,"
296,STORY OF RIMINI.,That men of health were of unusual cheer;
297,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Stepping like Homer at the trumpet's call,"
298,STORY OF RIMINI.,Or young Apollo on the pedestal:
299,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And lovely women were as fair and warm,"
300,STORY OF RIMINI.,As Venus looking sideways in alarm.
301,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The breezes were ethereal, and pure,"
302,STORY OF RIMINI.,And crept through half closed lattices to cure
303,STORY OF RIMINI.,"The languid sick; it cool'd their fever'd sleep,"
304,STORY OF RIMINI.,And soothed them into slumbers full and deep.
305,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Soon they awoke clear eyed: nor burnt with thirsting,"
306,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Nor with hot fingers, nor with temples bursting:"
307,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And springing up, they met the wond'ring sight"
308,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Of their dear friends, nigh foolish with delight;"
309,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Who feel their arms, and breasts, and kiss and stare,"
310,STORY OF RIMINI.,And on their placid foreheads part the hair.
311,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Young men, and maidens at each other gaz'd"
312,STORY OF RIMINI.,"With hands held back, and motionless, amaz'd"
313,STORY OF RIMINI.,To see the brightness in each others' eyes;
314,STORY OF RIMINI.,"And so they stood, fill'd with a sweet surprise,"
315,STORY OF RIMINI.,Until their tongues were loos'd in poesy.
316,STORY OF RIMINI.,Therefore no lover did of anguish die:
317,STORY OF RIMINI.,"But the soft numbers, in that moment spoken,"
318,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Made silken ties, that never may be broken."
319,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Cynthia! I cannot tell the greater blisses,"
320,STORY OF RIMINI.,"That follow'd thine, and thy dear shepherd's kisses:"
321,STORY OF RIMINI.,"Was there a Poet born?--but now no more,"
322,STORY OF RIMINI.,My wand'ring spirit must no further soar.--

332,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,Not like the formal crest of latter days:

345,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"Hails it with tears, her stout defender sent:"

348,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"Sometimes, when the good Knight his rest would take,"

355,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,And his dark brow for very wrath is knit?
356,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"Or when his spirit, with more calm intent,"
357,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"Leaps to the honors of a tournament,"
358,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,And makes the gazers round about the ring
359,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,Stare at the grandeur of the balancing?
360,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"No, no! this is far off:--then how shall I"
361,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"Revive the dying tones of minstrelsy,"
362,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"Which linger yet about lone gothic arches,"
363,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"In dark green ivy, and among wild larches?"
364,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"How sing the splendour of the revelries,"
365,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,When buts of wine are drunk off to the lees?
366,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"And that bright lance, against the fretted wall,"
367,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"Beneath the shade of stately banneral,"
368,SPECIMEN OF AN INDUCTION TO A POEM.,"Is slung with shining cuirass, sword, and shield?"

404,CALIDORE.,
405,CALIDORE.,A fragment.
406,CALIDORE.,
407,CALIDORE.,
408,CALIDORE.,Young Calidore is paddling o'er the lake;
409,CALIDORE.,His healthful spirit eager and awake
410,CALIDORE.,"To feel the beauty of a silent eve,"
411,CALIDORE.,Which seem'd full loath this happy world to leave;
412,CALIDORE.,The light dwelt o'er the scene so lingeringly.
413,CALIDORE.,"He bares his forehead to the cool blue sky,"
414,CALIDORE.,"And smiles at the far clearness all around,"
415,CALIDORE.,"Until his heart is well nigh over wound,"
416,CALIDORE.,And turns for calmness to the pleasant green
417,CALIDORE.,"Of easy slopes, and shadowy trees that lean"
418,CALIDORE.,So elegantly o'er the waters' brim
419,CALIDORE.,And show their blossoms trim.
420,CALIDORE.,Scarce can his clear and nimble eye-sight follow
421,CALIDORE.,"The freaks, and dartings of the black-wing'd swallow,"
422,CALIDORE.,"Delighting much, to see it half at rest,"
423,CALIDORE.,"Dip so refreshingly its wings, and breast"
424,CALIDORE.,"'Gainst the smooth surface, and to mark anon,"
425,CALIDORE.,The widening circles into nothing gone.
426,CALIDORE.,
427,CALIDORE.,And now the sharp keel of his little boat
428,CALIDORE.,"Comes up with ripple, and with easy float,"
429,CALIDORE.,And glides into a bed of water lillies:
430,CALIDORE.,Broad leav'd are they and their white canopies
431,CALIDORE.,Are upward turn'd to catch the heavens' dew.
432,CALIDORE.,Near to a little island's point they grew;
433,CALIDORE.,Whence Calidore might have the goodliest view
434,CALIDORE.,Of this sweet spot of earth. The bowery shore
435,CALIDORE.,Went off in gentle windings to the hoar
436,CALIDORE.,And light blue mountains: but no breathing man
437,CALIDORE.,"With a warm heart, and eye prepared to scan"
438,CALIDORE.,"Nature's clear beauty, could pass lightly by"
439,CALIDORE.,Objects that look'd out so invitingly
440,CALIDORE.,"On either side. These, gentle Calidore"
441,CALIDORE.,"Greeted, as he had known them long before."
442,CALIDORE.,
443,CALIDORE.,"The sidelong view of swelling leafiness,"
444,CALIDORE.,"Which the glad setting sun, in gold doth dress;"
445,CALIDORE.,"Whence ever, and anon the jay outsprings,"
446,CALIDORE.,And scales upon the beauty of its wings.
447,CALIDORE.,
448,CALIDORE.,"The lonely turret, shatter'd, and outworn,"
449,CALIDORE.,Stands venerably proud; too proud to mourn
450,CALIDORE.,"Its long lost grandeur: fir trees grow around,"
451,CALIDORE.,Aye dropping their hard fruit upon the ground.
452,CALIDORE.,
453,CALIDORE.,The little chapel with the cross above
454,CALIDORE.,"Upholding wreaths of ivy; the white dove,"
455,CALIDORE.,"That on the windows spreads his feathers light,"
456,CALIDORE.,And seems from purple clouds to wing its flight.
457,CALIDORE.,
458,CALIDORE.,Green tufted islands casting their soft shades
459,CALIDORE.,"Across the lake; sequester'd leafy glades,"
460,CALIDORE.,That through the dimness of their twilight show
461,CALIDORE.,"Large dock leaves, spiral foxgloves, or the glow"
462,CALIDORE.,"Of the wild cat's eyes, or the silvery stems"
463,CALIDORE.,"Of delicate birch trees, or long grass which hems"
464,CALIDORE.,A little brook. The youth had long been viewing
465,CALIDORE.,"These pleasant things, and heaven was bedewing"
466,CALIDORE.,"The mountain flowers, when his glad senses caught"
467,CALIDORE.,A trumpet's silver voice. Ah! it was fraught
468,CALIDORE.,With many joys for him: the warder's ken
469,CALIDORE.,Had found white coursers prancing in the glen:
470,CALIDORE.,Friends very dear to him he soon will see;
471,CALIDORE.,"So pushes off his boat most eagerly,"
472,CALIDORE.,"And soon upon the lake he skims along,"
473,CALIDORE.,Deaf to the nightingale's first under-song;
474,CALIDORE.,Nor minds he the white swans that dream so sweetly:
475,CALIDORE.,His spirit flies before him so completely.
476,CALIDORE.,
477,CALIDORE.,"And now he turns a jutting point of land,"
478,CALIDORE.,"Whence may be seen the castle gloomy, and grand:"
479,CALIDORE.,"Nor will a bee buzz round two swelling peaches,"
480,CALIDORE.,Before the point of his light shallop reaches
481,CALIDORE.,Those marble steps that through the water dip:
482,CALIDORE.,"Now over them he goes with hasty trip,"
483,CALIDORE.,And scarcely stays to ope the folding doors:
484,CALIDORE.,Anon he leaps along the oaken floors
485,CALIDORE.,Of halls and corridors.
486,CALIDORE.,
487,CALIDORE.,Delicious sounds! those little bright-eyed things
488,CALIDORE.,"That float about the air on azure wings,"
489,CALIDORE.,Had been less heartfelt by him than the clang
490,CALIDORE.,"Of clattering hoofs; into the court he sprang,"
491,CALIDORE.,"Just as two noble steeds, and palfreys twain,"
492,CALIDORE.,Were slanting out their necks with loosened rein;
493,CALIDORE.,While from beneath the threat'ning portcullis
494,CALIDORE.,"They brought their happy burthens. What a kiss,"
495,CALIDORE.,What gentle squeeze he gave each lady's hand!
496,CALIDORE.,How tremblingly their delicate ancles spann'd!
497,CALIDORE.,"Into how sweet a trance his soul was gone,"
498,CALIDORE.,While whisperings of affection
499,CALIDORE.,Made him delay to let their tender feet
500,CALIDORE.,Come to the earth; with an incline so sweet
501,CALIDORE.,From their low palfreys o'er his neck they bent:
502,CALIDORE.,"And whether there were tears of languishment,"
503,CALIDORE.,"Or that the evening dew had pearl'd their tresses,"
504,CALIDORE.,"He feels a moisture on his cheek, and blesses"
505,CALIDORE.,"With lips that tremble, and with glistening eye"
506,CALIDORE.,All the soft luxury
507,CALIDORE.,"That nestled in his arms. A dimpled hand,"
508,CALIDORE.,"Fair as some wonder out of fairy land,"
509,CALIDORE.,Hung from his shoulder like the drooping flowers
510,CALIDORE.,"Of whitest Cassia, fresh from summer showers:"
511,CALIDORE.,And this he fondled with his happy cheek
512,CALIDORE.,As if for joy he would no further seek;
513,CALIDORE.,When the kind voice of good Sir Clerimond
514,CALIDORE.,"Came to his ear, like something from beyond"
515,CALIDORE.,His present being: so he gently drew
516,CALIDORE.,"His warm arms, thrilling now with pulses new,"
517,CALIDORE.,"From their sweet thrall, and forward gently bending,"
518,CALIDORE.,Thank'd heaven that his joy was never ending;
519,CALIDORE.,While 'gainst his forehead he devoutly press'd
520,CALIDORE.,A hand heaven made to succour the distress'd;
521,CALIDORE.,A hand that from the world's bleak promontory
522,CALIDORE.,Had lifted Calidore for deeds of glory.
523,CALIDORE.,
524,CALIDORE.,"Amid the pages, and the torches' glare,"
525,CALIDORE.,"There stood a knight, patting the flowing hair"
526,CALIDORE.,Of his proud horse's mane: he was withal
527,CALIDORE.,"A man of elegance, and stature tall:"
528,CALIDORE.,So that the waving of his plumes would be
529,CALIDORE.,"High as the berries of a wild ash tree,"
530,CALIDORE.,Or as the winged cap of Mercury.
531,CALIDORE.,His armour was so dexterously wrought
532,CALIDORE.,"In shape, that sure no living man had thought"
533,CALIDORE.,"It hard, and heavy steel: but that indeed"
534,CALIDORE.,"It was some glorious form, some splendid weed,"
535,CALIDORE.,In which a spirit new come from the skies
536,CALIDORE.,"Might live, and show itself to human eyes."
537,CALIDORE.,"'Tis the far-fam'd, the brave Sir Gondibert,"
538,CALIDORE.,Said the good man to Calidore alert;
539,CALIDORE.,While the young warrior with a step of grace
540,CALIDORE.,"Came up,--a courtly smile upon his face,"
541,CALIDORE.,"And mailed hand held out, ready to greet"
542,CALIDORE.,"The large-eyed wonder, and ambitious heat"
543,CALIDORE.,Of the aspiring boy; who as he led
544,CALIDORE.,"Those smiling ladies, often turned his head"
545,CALIDORE.,To admire the visor arched so gracefully
546,CALIDORE.,Over a knightly brow; while they went by
547,CALIDORE.,"The lamps that from the high-roof'd hall were pendent,"
548,CALIDORE.,And gave the steel a shining quite transcendent.
549,CALIDORE.,
550,CALIDORE.,Soon in a pleasant chamber they are seated;
551,CALIDORE.,The sweet-lipp'd ladies have already greeted
552,CALIDORE.,"All the green leaves that round the window clamber,"
553,CALIDORE.,"To show their purple stars, and bells of amber."
554,CALIDORE.,"Sir Gondibert has doff'd his shining steel,"
555,CALIDORE.,"Gladdening in the free, and airy feel"
556,CALIDORE.,Of a light mantle; and while Clerimond
557,CALIDORE.,"Is looking round about him with a fond,"
558,CALIDORE.,"And placid eye, young Calidore is burning"
559,CALIDORE.,"To hear of knightly deeds, and gallant spurning"
560,CALIDORE.,Of all unworthiness; and how the strong of arm
561,CALIDORE.,"Kept off dismay, and terror, and alarm"
562,CALIDORE.,"From lovely woman: while brimful of this,"
563,CALIDORE.,"He gave each damsel's hand so warm a kiss,"
564,CALIDORE.,"And had such manly ardour in his eye,"
565,CALIDORE.,That each at other look'd half staringly;
566,CALIDORE.,And then their features started into smiles
567,CALIDORE.,Sweet as blue heavens o'er enchanted isles.
568,CALIDORE.,
569,CALIDORE.,"Softly the breezes from the forest came,"
570,CALIDORE.,Softly they blew aside the taper's flame;
571,CALIDORE.,Clear was the song from Philomel's far bower;
572,CALIDORE.,Grateful the incense from the lime-tree flower;
573,CALIDORE.,"Mysterious, wild, the far heard trumpet's tone;"
574,CALIDORE.,"Lovely the moon in ether, all alone:"
575,CALIDORE.,"Sweet too the converse of these happy mortals,"
576,CALIDORE.,As that of busy spirits when the portals
577,CALIDORE.,Are closing in the west; or that soft humming
578,CALIDORE.,We hear around when Hesperus is coming.
579,CALIDORE.,Sweet be their sleep. * * * * * * * * *

1255,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Who read for me the sonnet swelling loudly

1269,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"What my enjoyments in my youthful years,"
1270,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Bereft of all that now my life endears?
1271,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,And can I e'er these benefits forget?

1273,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"No, doubly no;--yet should these rhymings please,"
1274,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,I shall roll on the grass with two-fold ease:
1275,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,For I have long time been my fancy feeding
1276,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,With hopes that you would one day think the reading
1277,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Of my rough verses not an hour misspent;
1278,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Should it e'er be so, what a rich content!"
1279,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Some weeks have pass'd since last I saw the spires
1280,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,In lucent Thames reflected:--warm desires
1281,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"To see the sun o'er peep the eastern dimness,"
1282,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,And morning shadows streaking into slimness
1283,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Across the lawny fields, and pebbly water;"
1284,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"To mark the time as they grow broad, and shorter;"
1285,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"To feel the air that plays about the hills,"
1286,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,And sips its freshness from the little rills;
1287,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"To see high, golden corn wave in the light"
1288,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"When Cynthia smiles upon a summer's night,"
1289,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"And peers among the cloudlet's jet and white,"
1290,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,As though she were reclining in a bed
1291,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Of bean blossoms, in heaven freshly shed."
1292,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,No sooner had I stepp'd into these pleasures
1293,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Than I began to think of rhymes and measures:
1294,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,The air that floated by me seem'd to say
1295,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"""Write! thou wilt never have a better day."""
1296,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"And so I did. When many lines I'd written,"
1297,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Though with their grace I was not oversmitten,"
1298,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Yet, as my hand was warm, I thought I'd better"
1299,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Trust to my feelings, and write you a letter."
1300,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Such an attempt required an inspiration
1301,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Of a peculiar sort,--a consummation;--"
1302,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Which, had I felt, these scribblings might have been"
1303,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Verses from which the soul would never wean:
1304,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,But many days have past since last my heart
1305,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Was warm'd luxuriously by divine Mozart;
1306,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"By Arne delighted, or by Handel madden'd;"
1307,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Or by the song of Erin pierc'd and sadden'd:
1308,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"What time you were before the music sitting,"
1309,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,And the rich notes to each sensation fitting.
1310,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Since I have walk'd with you through shady lanes
1311,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"That freshly terminate in open plains,"
1312,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,And revel'd in a chat that ceased not
1313,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,When at night-fall among your books we got:
1314,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"No, nor when supper came, nor after that,--"
1315,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Nor when reluctantly I took my hat;
1316,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"No, nor till cordially you shook my hand"
1317,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Mid-way between our homes:--your accents bland
1318,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Still sounded in my ears, when I no more"
1319,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,Could hear your footsteps touch the grav'ly floor.
1320,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"Sometimes I lost them, and then found again;"
1321,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,You chang'd the footpath for the grassy plain.
1322,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,In those still moments I have wish'd you joys
1323,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"That well you know to honour:--""Life's very toys"
1324,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"With him,"" said I, ""will take a pleasant charm;"
1325,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,"It cannot be that ought will work him harm."""
1326,TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE.,These thoughts now come o'er me with all their might:--

1826,CHAUCER.,"As hard as lips can make it: till agreed,"
1827,CHAUCER.,A lovely tale of human life we'll read.
1828,CHAUCER.,And one will teach a tame dove how it best

1830,CHAUCER.,"Another, bending o'er her nimble tread,"
1831,CHAUCER.,"Will set a green robe floating round her head,"

1846,CHAUCER.,Looks out upon the winds with glorious fear:
1847,CHAUCER.,And now the numerous tramplings quiver lightly
1848,CHAUCER.,Along a huge cloud's ridge; and now with sprightly
1849,CHAUCER.,"Wheel downward come they into fresher skies,"
1850,CHAUCER.,Tipt round with silver from the sun's bright eyes.
1851,CHAUCER.,"Still downward with capacious whirl they glide,"
1852,CHAUCER.,And now I see them on a green-hill's side

1854,CHAUCER.,The charioteer with wond'rous gesture talks

1859,CHAUCER.,Some ever-fleeting music on they sweep.
1860,CHAUCER.,"Lo! how they murmur, laugh, and smile, and weep:"
1861,CHAUCER.,Some with upholden hand and mouth severe;
1862,CHAUCER.,Some with their faces muffled to the ear
1863,CHAUCER.,"Between their arms; some, clear in youthful bloom,"
1864,CHAUCER.,"Go glad and smilingly, athwart the gloom;"
1865,CHAUCER.,"Some looking back, and some with upward gaze;"
1866,CHAUCER.,"Yes, thousands in a thousand different ways"
1867,CHAUCER.,Flit onward--now a lovely wreath of girls
1868,CHAUCER.,Dancing their sleek hair into tangled curls;
1869,CHAUCER.,And now broad wings. Most awfully intent
1870,CHAUCER.,"The driver, of those steeds is forward bent,"
1871,CHAUCER.,And seems to listen: O that I might know
1872,CHAUCER.,All that he writes with such a hurrying glow.
1873,CHAUCER.,
1874,CHAUCER.,The visions all are fled--the car is fled
1875,CHAUCER.,"Into the light of heaven, and in their stead"

1883,CHAUCER.,Is there so small a range
1884,CHAUCER.,"In the present strength of manhood, that the high"
1885,CHAUCER.,Imagination cannot freely fly
1886,CHAUCER.,"As she was wont of old? prepare her steeds,"
1887,CHAUCER.,"Paw up against the light, and do strange deeds"
1888,CHAUCER.,Upon the clouds? Has she not shewn us all?
1889,CHAUCER.,"From the clear space of ether, to the small"
1890,CHAUCER.,Breath of new buds unfolding? From the meaning
1891,CHAUCER.,"Of Jove's large eye-brow, to the tender greening"
1892,CHAUCER.,"Of April meadows? Here her altar shone,"
1893,CHAUCER.,E'en in this isle; and who could paragon
1894,CHAUCER.,The fervid choir that lifted up a noise
1895,CHAUCER.,"Of harmony, to where it aye will poise"
1896,CHAUCER.,"Its mighty self of convoluting sound,"
1897,CHAUCER.,"Huge as a planet, and like that roll round,"
1898,CHAUCER.,Eternally around a dizzy void?
1899,CHAUCER.,"Ay, in those days the Muses were nigh cloy'd"
1900,CHAUCER.,With honors; nor had any other care
1901,CHAUCER.,Than to sing out and sooth their wavy hair.
1902,CHAUCER.,
1903,CHAUCER.,"Could all this be forgotten? Yes, a schism"
1904,CHAUCER.,"Nurtured by foppery and barbarism,"
1905,CHAUCER.,Made great Apollo blush for this his land.
1906,CHAUCER.,Men were thought wise who could not understand

1908,CHAUCER.,"They sway'd about upon a rocking horse,"
1909,CHAUCER.,And thought it Pegasus. Ah dismal soul'd!
1910,CHAUCER.,"The winds of heaven blew, the ocean roll'd"
1911,CHAUCER.,Its gathering waves--ye felt it not. The blue
1912,CHAUCER.,"Bared its eternal bosom, and the dew"
1913,CHAUCER.,Of summer nights collected still to make
1914,CHAUCER.,The morning precious: beauty was awake!
1915,CHAUCER.,Why were ye not awake? But ye were dead
1916,CHAUCER.,"To things ye knew not of,--were closely wed"
1917,CHAUCER.,To musty laws lined out with wretched rule
1918,CHAUCER.,And compass vile: so that ye taught a school
1919,CHAUCER.,"Of dolts to smooth, inlay, and clip, and fit,"
1920,CHAUCER.,"Till, like the certain wands of Jacob's wit,"
1921,CHAUCER.,Their verses tallied. Easy was the task:
1922,CHAUCER.,A thousand handicraftsmen wore the mask
1923,CHAUCER.,"Of Poesy. Ill-fated, impious race!"
1924,CHAUCER.,"That blasphemed the bright Lyrist to his face,"
1925,CHAUCER.,"And did not know it,--no, they went about,"
1926,CHAUCER.,"Holding a poor, decrepid standard out"
1927,CHAUCER.,"Mark'd with most flimsy mottos, and in large"
1928,CHAUCER.,The name of one Boileau!
1929,CHAUCER.,
1930,CHAUCER.,O ye whose charge
1931,CHAUCER.,It is to hover round our pleasant hills!
1932,CHAUCER.,Whose congregated majesty so fills
1933,CHAUCER.,"My boundly reverence, that I cannot trace"
1934,CHAUCER.,"Your hallowed names, in this unholy place,"
1935,CHAUCER.,So near those common folk; did not their shames
1936,CHAUCER.,Affright you? Did our old lamenting Thames
1937,CHAUCER.,Delight you? Did ye never cluster round
1938,CHAUCER.,"Delicious Avon, with a mournful sound,"
1939,CHAUCER.,And weep? Or did ye wholly bid adieu
1940,CHAUCER.,To regions where no more the laurel grew?
1941,CHAUCER.,Or did ye stay to give a welcoming
1942,CHAUCER.,To some lone spirits who could proudly sing
1943,CHAUCER.,"Their youth away, and die? 'Twas even so:"
1944,CHAUCER.,But let me think away those times of woe:
1945,CHAUCER.,Now 'tis a fairer season; ye have breathed
1946,CHAUCER.,Rich benedictions o'er us; ye have wreathed
1947,CHAUCER.,Fresh garlands: for sweet music has been heard
1948,CHAUCER.,In many places;--some has been upstirr'd
1949,CHAUCER.,"From out its crystal dwelling in a lake,"
1950,CHAUCER.,"By a swan's ebon bill; from a thick brake,"
1951,CHAUCER.,"Nested and quiet in a valley mild,"
1952,CHAUCER.,Bubbles a pipe; fine sounds are floating wild
1953,CHAUCER.,About the earth: happy are ye and glad.
1954,CHAUCER.,
1955,CHAUCER.,These things are doubtless: yet in truth we've had
1956,CHAUCER.,Strange thunders from the potency of song;
1957,CHAUCER.,"Mingled indeed with what is sweet and strong,"
1958,CHAUCER.,From majesty: but in clear truth the themes
1959,CHAUCER.,"Are ugly clubs, the Poets Polyphemes"
1960,CHAUCER.,Disturbing the grand sea. A drainless shower
1961,CHAUCER.,Of light is poesy; 'tis the supreme of power;
1962,CHAUCER.,'Tis might half slumb'ring on its own right arm.
1963,CHAUCER.,The very archings of her eye-lids charm
1964,CHAUCER.,"A thousand willing agents to obey,"
1965,CHAUCER.,And still she governs with the mildest sway:
1966,CHAUCER.,But strength alone though of the Muses born
1967,CHAUCER.,"Is like a fallen angel: trees uptorn,"
1968,CHAUCER.,"Darkness, and worms, and shrouds, and sepulchres"
1969,CHAUCER.,"Delight it; for it feeds upon the burrs,"
1970,CHAUCER.,And thorns of life; forgetting the great end
1971,CHAUCER.,"Of poesy, that it should be a friend"
1972,CHAUCER.,"To sooth the cares, and lift the thoughts of man."
1973,CHAUCER.,
1974,CHAUCER.,Yet I rejoice: a myrtle fairer than
1975,CHAUCER.,"E'er grew in Paphos, from the bitter weeds"
1976,CHAUCER.,"Lifts its sweet head into the air, and feeds"
1977,CHAUCER.,A silent space with ever sprouting green.
1978,CHAUCER.,"All tenderest birds there find a pleasant screen,"
1979,CHAUCER.,"Creep through the shade with jaunty fluttering,"
1980,CHAUCER.,Nibble the little cupped flowers and sing.
1981,CHAUCER.,Then let us clear away the choaking thorns
1982,CHAUCER.,"From round its gentle stem; let the young fawns,"
1983,CHAUCER.,"Yeaned in after times, when we are flown,"
1984,CHAUCER.,"Find a fresh sward beneath it, overgrown"
1985,CHAUCER.,With simple flowers: let there nothing be
1986,CHAUCER.,More boisterous than a lover's bended knee;
1987,CHAUCER.,Nought more ungentle than the placid look
1988,CHAUCER.,Of one who leans upon a closed book;
1989,CHAUCER.,Nought more untranquil than the grassy slopes
1990,CHAUCER.,Between two hills. All hail delightful hopes!
1991,CHAUCER.,"As she was wont, th' imagination"
1992,CHAUCER.,"Into most lovely labyrinths will be gone,"
1993,CHAUCER.,And they shall be accounted poet kings
1994,CHAUCER.,Who simply tell the most heart-easing things.
1995,CHAUCER.,O may these joys be ripe before I die.
1996,CHAUCER.,
1997,CHAUCER.,Will not some say that I presumptuously
1998,CHAUCER.,Have spoken? that from hastening disgrace
1999,CHAUCER.,'Twere better far to hide my foolish face?
2000,CHAUCER.,That whining boyhood should with reverence bow
2001,CHAUCER.,Ere the dread thunderbolt could reach? How!
2002,CHAUCER.,"If I do hide myself, it sure shall be"
2003,CHAUCER.,"In the very fane, the light of Poesy:"
2004,CHAUCER.,"If I do fall, at least I will be laid"
2005,CHAUCER.,Beneath the silence of a poplar shade;
2006,CHAUCER.,And over me the grass shall be smooth shaven;
2007,CHAUCER.,And there shall be a kind memorial graven.
2008,CHAUCER.,But oft' Despondence! miserable bane!
2009,CHAUCER.,"They should not know thee, who athirst to gain"
2010,CHAUCER.,"A noble end, are thirsty every hour."
2011,CHAUCER.,What though I am not wealthy in the dower
2012,CHAUCER.,Of spanning wisdom; though I do not know
2013,CHAUCER.,"The shiftings of the mighty winds, that blow"
2014,CHAUCER.,Hither and thither all the changing thoughts
2015,CHAUCER.,Of man: though no great minist'ring reason sorts
2016,CHAUCER.,Out the dark mysteries of human souls
2017,CHAUCER.,To clear conceiving: yet there ever rolls
2018,CHAUCER.,"A vast idea before me, and I glean"
2019,CHAUCER.,Therefrom my liberty; thence too I've seen
2020,CHAUCER.,The end and aim of Poesy. 'Tis clear
2021,CHAUCER.,As any thing most true; as that the year
2022,CHAUCER.,Is made of the four seasons--manifest
2023,CHAUCER.,"As a large cross, some old cathedral's crest,"
2024,CHAUCER.,Lifted to the white clouds. Therefore should I
2025,CHAUCER.,"Be but the essence of deformity,"
2026,CHAUCER.,"A coward, did my very eye-lids wink"
2027,CHAUCER.,At speaking out what I have dared to think.
2028,CHAUCER.,Ah! rather let me like a madman run
2029,CHAUCER.,Over some precipice; let the hot sun
2030,CHAUCER.,"Melt my Dedalian wings, and drive me down"
2031,CHAUCER.,Convuls'd and headlong! Stay! an inward frown
2032,CHAUCER.,Of conscience bids me be more calm awhile.
2033,CHAUCER.,"An ocean dim, sprinkled with many an isle,"
2034,CHAUCER.,Spreads awfully before me. How much toil!
2035,CHAUCER.,How many days! what desperate turmoil!
2036,CHAUCER.,Ere I can have explored its widenesses.
2037,CHAUCER.,"Ah, what a task! upon my bended knees,"
2038,CHAUCER.,"I could unsay those--no, impossible!"
2039,CHAUCER.,Impossible!
2040,CHAUCER.,
2041,CHAUCER.,For sweet relief I'll dwell
2042,CHAUCER.,"On humbler thoughts, and let this strange assay"
2043,CHAUCER.,Begun in gentleness die so away.
2044,CHAUCER.,E'en now all tumult from my bosom fades:
2045,CHAUCER.,I turn full hearted to the friendly aids
2046,CHAUCER.,"That smooth the path of honour; brotherhood,"
2047,CHAUCER.,And friendliness the nurse of mutual good.
2048,CHAUCER.,The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet
2049,CHAUCER.,Into the brain ere one can think upon it;
2050,CHAUCER.,The silence when some rhymes are coming out;
2051,CHAUCER.,"And when they're come, the very pleasant rout:"
2052,CHAUCER.,The message certain to be done to-morrow.
2053,CHAUCER.,'Tis perhaps as well that it should be to borrow
2054,CHAUCER.,"Some precious book from out its snug retreat,"
2055,CHAUCER.,To cluster round it when we next shall meet.
2056,CHAUCER.,Scarce can I scribble on; for lovely airs
2057,CHAUCER.,Are fluttering round the room like doves in pairs;
2058,CHAUCER.,"Many delights of that glad day recalling,"
2059,CHAUCER.,When first my senses caught their tender falling.
2060,CHAUCER.,And with these airs come forms of elegance
2061,CHAUCER.,"Stooping their shoulders o'er a horse's prance,"
2062,CHAUCER.,"Careless, and grand--fingers soft and round"
2063,CHAUCER.,Parting luxuriant curls;--and the swift bound
2064,CHAUCER.,"Of Bacchus from his chariot, when his eye"
2065,CHAUCER.,Made Ariadne's cheek look blushingly.
2066,CHAUCER.,Thus I remember all the pleasant flow
2067,CHAUCER.,Of words at opening a portfolio.
2068,CHAUCER.,
2069,CHAUCER.,Things such as these are ever harbingers
2070,CHAUCER.,To trains of peaceful images: the stirs
2071,CHAUCER.,Of a swan's neck unseen among the rushes:
2072,CHAUCER.,A linnet starting all about the bushes:
2073,CHAUCER.,"A butterfly, with golden wings broad parted,"
2074,CHAUCER.,"Nestling a rose, convuls'd as though it smarted"
2075,CHAUCER.,"With over pleasure--many, many more,"
2076,CHAUCER.,Might I indulge at large in all my store
2077,CHAUCER.,Of luxuries: yet I must not forget
2078,CHAUCER.,"Sleep, quiet with his poppy coronet:"
2079,CHAUCER.,For what there may be worthy in these rhymes
2080,CHAUCER.,"I partly owe to him: and thus, the chimes"
2081,CHAUCER.,Of friendly voices had just given place
2082,CHAUCER.,"To as sweet a silence, when I 'gan retrace"
2083,CHAUCER.,"The pleasant day, upon a couch at ease."
2084,CHAUCER.,It was a poet's house who keeps the keys
2085,CHAUCER.,Of pleasure's temple. Round about were hung
2086,CHAUCER.,The glorious features of the bards who sung
2087,CHAUCER.,In other ages--cold and sacred busts
2088,CHAUCER.,Smiled at each other. Happy he who trusts
2089,CHAUCER.,To clear Futurity his darling fame!
2090,CHAUCER.,Then there were fauns and satyrs taking aim
2091,CHAUCER.,At swelling apples with a frisky leap
2092,CHAUCER.,"And reaching fingers, 'mid a luscious heap"
2093,CHAUCER.,Of vine leaves. Then there rose to view a fane
2094,CHAUCER.,"Of liny marble, and thereto a train"
2095,CHAUCER.,Of nymphs approaching fairly o'er the sward:
2096,CHAUCER.,"One, loveliest, holding her white band toward"
2097,CHAUCER.,The dazzling sun-rise: two sisters sweet
2098,CHAUCER.,Bending their graceful figures till they meet
2099,CHAUCER.,Over the trippings of a little child:
2100,CHAUCER.,"And some are hearing, eagerly, the wild"
2101,CHAUCER.,Thrilling liquidity of dewy piping.
2102,CHAUCER.,"See, in another picture, nymphs are wiping"
2103,CHAUCER.,Cherishingly Diana's timorous limbs;--
2104,CHAUCER.,A fold of lawny mantle dabbling swims
2105,CHAUCER.,"At the bath's edge, and keeps a gentle motion"
2106,CHAUCER.,With the subsiding crystal: as when ocean
2107,CHAUCER.,Heaves calmly its broad swelling smoothiness o'er
2108,CHAUCER.,"Its rocky marge, and balances once more"
2109,CHAUCER.,The patient weeds; that now unshent by foam
2110,CHAUCER.,Feel all about their undulating home.
2111,CHAUCER.,
2112,CHAUCER.,Sappho's meek head was there half smiling down
2113,CHAUCER.,At nothing; just as though the earnest frown
2114,CHAUCER.,Of over thinking had that moment gone
2115,CHAUCER.,"From off her brow, and left her all alone."
2116,CHAUCER.,
2117,CHAUCER.,"Great Alfred's too, with anxious, pitying eyes,"
2118,CHAUCER.,As if he always listened to the sighs
2119,CHAUCER.,Of the goaded world; and Kosciusko's worn
2120,CHAUCER.,By horrid suffrance--mightily forlorn.
2121,CHAUCER.,
2122,CHAUCER.,"Petrarch, outstepping from the shady green,"
2123,CHAUCER.,Starts at the sight of Laura; nor can wean
2124,CHAUCER.,His eyes from her sweet face. Most happy they!
2125,CHAUCER.,For over them was seen a free display
2126,CHAUCER.,"Of out-spread wings, and from between them shone"
2127,CHAUCER.,The face of Poesy: from off her throne
2128,CHAUCER.,She overlook'd things that I scarce could tell.
2129,CHAUCER.,The very sense of where I was might well
2130,CHAUCER.,Keep Sleep aloof: but more than that there came
2131,CHAUCER.,Thought after thought to nourish up the flame
2132,CHAUCER.,Within my breast; so that the morning light
2133,CHAUCER.,Surprised me even from a sleepless night;
2134,CHAUCER.,"And up I rose refresh'd, and glad, and gay,"
2135,CHAUCER.,Resolving to begin that very day
2136,CHAUCER.,"These lines; and howsoever they be done,"
2137,CHAUCER.,I leave them as a father does his son.
