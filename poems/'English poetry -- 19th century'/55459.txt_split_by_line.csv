71,THE RETREAT.,
72,THE RETREAT.,{1}
73,THE RETREAT.,
74,THE RETREAT.,1.
75,THE RETREAT.,Around her Father's neck the Maiden lock'd
76,THE RETREAT.,"Her arms, when that portentous blow was given;"
77,THE RETREAT.,"Clinging to him she heard the dread uproar,"
78,THE RETREAT.,And felt the shuddering shock which ran through Heaven.
79,THE RETREAT.,"Earth underneath them rock'd,"
80,THE RETREAT.,"Her strong foundations heaving in commotion,"
81,THE RETREAT.,"Such as wild winds upraise in raving Ocean,"
82,THE RETREAT.,As though the solid base were rent asunder.
83,THE RETREAT.,{2}
84,THE RETREAT.,"And lo! where, storming the astonish'd sky,"
85,THE RETREAT.,Kehama and his evil host ascend!
86,THE RETREAT.,"Before them rolls the thunder,"
87,THE RETREAT.,"Ten thousand thousand lightnings round them fly,"
88,THE RETREAT.,"Upward the lengthening pageantries aspire,"
89,THE RETREAT.,Leaving from Earth to Heaven a widening wake of fire.
90,THE RETREAT.,
91,THE RETREAT.,2.
92,THE RETREAT.,"When the wild uproar was at length allay'd,"
93,THE RETREAT.,"And Earth, recovering from the shock, was still,"
94,THE RETREAT.,Thus to her father spake the imploring Maid.
95,THE RETREAT.,Oh! by the love which we so long have borne
96,THE RETREAT.,"Each other, and we ne'er shall cease to bear, . ."
97,THE RETREAT.,"Oh! by the sufferings we have shar'd,"
98,THE RETREAT.,"And must not cease to share, . ."
99,THE RETREAT.,"One boon I supplicate in this dread hour,"
100,THE RETREAT.,One consolation in this hour of woe!
101,THE RETREAT.,"Thou hast it in thy power, refuse not thou"
102,THE RETREAT.,The only comfort now
103,THE RETREAT.,That my poor heart can know.
104,THE RETREAT.,
105,THE RETREAT.,3.
106,THE RETREAT.,"O dearest, dearest Kailyal! with a smile"
107,THE RETREAT.,"Of tenderness and sorrow, he replied,"
108,THE RETREAT.,{3}
109,THE RETREAT.,"O best belov'd, and to be lov'd the best"
110,THE RETREAT.,"Best worthy, . . set thy duteous heart at rest."
111,THE RETREAT.,"I know thy wish, and let what will betide,"
112,THE RETREAT.,Ne'er will I leave thee wilfully again.
113,THE RETREAT.,My soul is strengthen'd to endure its pain;
114,THE RETREAT.,"Be thou, in all my wanderings, still my guide;"
115,THE RETREAT.,"Be thou, in all my sufferings, at my side."
116,THE RETREAT.,
117,THE RETREAT.,4.
118,THE RETREAT.,"The Maiden, at those welcome words, imprest"
119,THE RETREAT.,A passionate kiss upon her father's cheek:
120,THE RETREAT.,"They look'd around them, then, as if to seek"
121,THE RETREAT.,"Where they should turn, North, South, or East or West,"
122,THE RETREAT.,Wherever to their vagrant feet seem'd best.
123,THE RETREAT.,"But, turning from the view her mournful eyes,"
124,THE RETREAT.,"Oh, whither should we wander, Kailyal cries,"
125,THE RETREAT.,Or wherefore seek in vain a place of rest?
126,THE RETREAT.,"Have we not here the Earth beneath our tread,"
127,THE RETREAT.,"Heaven overhead,"
128,THE RETREAT.,"A brook that winds through this sequester'd glade,"
129,THE RETREAT.,"And yonder woods, to yield us fruit and shade!"
130,THE RETREAT.,The little all our wants require is nigh;
131,THE RETREAT.,"Hope we have none, . . why travel on in fear?"
132,THE RETREAT.,"We cannot fly from Fate, and Fate will find us here."
133,THE RETREAT.,
134,THE RETREAT.,{4}
135,THE RETREAT.,
136,THE RETREAT.,5.
137,THE RETREAT.,"'Twas a fair scene wherein they stood,"
138,THE RETREAT.,"A green and sunny glade amid the wood,"
139,THE RETREAT.,And in the midst an aged Banian grew.
140,THE RETREAT.,It was a goodly sight to see
141,THE RETREAT.,"That venerable tree,"
142,THE RETREAT.,"For o'er the lawn, irregularly spread,"
143,THE RETREAT.,Fifty straight columns propt its lofty head;
144,THE RETREAT.,"And many a long depending shoot,"
145,THE RETREAT.,"Seeking to strike its root,"
146,THE RETREAT.,"Straight like a plummet, grew towards the ground."
147,THE RETREAT.,"Some on the lower boughs, which crost their way,"
148,THE RETREAT.,"Fixing their bearded fibres, round and round,"
149,THE RETREAT.,With many a ring and wild contortion wound;
150,THE RETREAT.,"Some to the passing wind at times, with sway"
151,THE RETREAT.,"Of gentle motion swung,"
152,THE RETREAT.,"Others of younger growth, unmov'd, were hung"
153,THE RETREAT.,Like stone-drops from the cavern's fretted height.
154,THE RETREAT.,"Beneath was smooth and fair to sight,"
155,THE RETREAT.,"Nor weeds nor briars deform'd the natural floor,"
156,THE RETREAT.,And through the leafy cope which bower'd it o'er
157,THE RETREAT.,Came gleams of checquered light.
158,THE RETREAT.,"So like a temple did it seem, that there"
159,THE RETREAT.,A pious heart's first impulse would be prayer.
160,THE RETREAT.,
161,THE RETREAT.,{5}
162,THE RETREAT.,
163,THE RETREAT.,6.
164,THE RETREAT.,"A brook, with easy current, murmured near;"
165,THE RETREAT.,Water so cool and clear
166,THE RETREAT.,"The peasants drink not from the humble well,"
167,THE RETREAT.,"Which they with sacrifice of rural pride,"
168,THE RETREAT.,Have wedded to the cocoa-grove beside;
169,THE RETREAT.,Nor tanks of costliest masonry dispense
170,THE RETREAT.,"To those in towns who dwell,"
171,THE RETREAT.,"The work of Kings, in their beneficence."
172,THE RETREAT.,"Fed by perpetual springs, a small lagoon,"
173,THE RETREAT.,"Pellucid, deep, and still, in silence join'd"
174,THE RETREAT.,And swell'd the passing stream. Like burnish'd steel
175,THE RETREAT.,"Glowing, it lay beneath the eye of noon;"
176,THE RETREAT.,"And when the breezes, in their play,"
177,THE RETREAT.,"Ruffled the darkening surface, then, with gleam"
178,THE RETREAT.,"Of sudden light, around the lotus stem"
179,THE RETREAT.,"It rippled, and the sacred flowers that crown"
180,THE RETREAT.,"The lakelet with their roseate beauty, ride,"
181,THE RETREAT.,"In gentlest waving rock'd, from side to side;"
182,THE RETREAT.,And as the wind upheaves
183,THE RETREAT.,"Their broad and buoyant weight, the glossy leaves"
184,THE RETREAT.,"Flap on the twinkling waters, up and down."
185,THE RETREAT.,
186,THE RETREAT.,7.
187,THE RETREAT.,"They built them here a bower; of jointed cane,"
188,THE RETREAT.,{6}
189,THE RETREAT.,"Strong for the needful use, and light and long"
190,THE RETREAT.,"Was the slight frame-work rear'd, with little pain;"
191,THE RETREAT.,"Lithe creepers, then, the wicker-sides supply,"
192,THE RETREAT.,And the tall jungle-grass fit roofing gave
193,THE RETREAT.,Beneath that genial sky.
194,THE RETREAT.,"And here did Kailyal, each returning day,"
195,THE RETREAT.,"Pour forth libations from the brook, to pay"
196,THE RETREAT.,The Spirits of her Sires their grateful rite;
197,THE RETREAT.,"In such libations pour'd in open glades,"
198,THE RETREAT.,"Beside clear streams and solitary shades,"
199,THE RETREAT.,The Spirits of the virtuous dead delight.
200,THE RETREAT.,"And duly here, to Marriataly's praise,"
201,THE RETREAT.,"The Maid, as with an Angel's voice of song,"
202,THE RETREAT.,Pour'd her melodious lays
203,THE RETREAT.,"Upon the gales of even,"
204,THE RETREAT.,"And gliding in religious dance along,"
205,THE RETREAT.,"Mov'd, graceful as the dark-eyed Nymphs of Heaven,"
206,THE RETREAT.,"Such harmony to all her steps was given,"
207,THE RETREAT.,
208,THE RETREAT.,8.
209,THE RETREAT.,"Thus ever, in her Father's doting eye,"
210,THE RETREAT.,Kailyal perform'd the customary rite;
211,THE RETREAT.,"He, patient of his burning pain the while,"
212,THE RETREAT.,"Beheld her, and approv'd her pious toil;"
213,THE RETREAT.,"And sometimes, at the sight,"
214,THE RETREAT.,{7}
215,THE RETREAT.,A melancholy smile
216,THE RETREAT.,"Would gleam upon his awful countenance,"
217,THE RETREAT.,"He, too, by day and night, and every hour,"
218,THE RETREAT.,Paid to a higher Power his sacrifice;
219,THE RETREAT.,"An offering, not of ghee, or fruit, or rice,"
220,THE RETREAT.,"Flower-crown, or blood; but of a heart subdued,"
221,THE RETREAT.,"A resolute, unconquer'd fortitude,"
222,THE RETREAT.,"An agony represt, a will resign'd,"
223,THE RETREAT.,"To her, who, on her secret throne reclin'd,"
224,THE RETREAT.,"Amid the milky Sea, by Veeshnoo's side,"
225,THE RETREAT.,Looks with an eye of mercy on mankind.
226,THE RETREAT.,"By the Preserver, with his power endued,"
227,THE RETREAT.,"There Voomdavee beholds this lower clime,"
228,THE RETREAT.,"And marks the silent sufferings of the good,"
229,THE RETREAT.,To recompense them in her own good time.
230,THE RETREAT.,
231,THE RETREAT.,9.
232,THE RETREAT.,O force of faith! O strength of virtuous will!
233,THE RETREAT.,"Behold him, in his endless martyrdom,"
234,THE RETREAT.,Triumphant still!
235,THE RETREAT.,"The Curse still burning in his heart and brain,"
236,THE RETREAT.,And yet doth he remain
237,THE RETREAT.,"Patient the while, and tranquil, and content!"
238,THE RETREAT.,The pious soul hath fram'd unto itself
239,THE RETREAT.,{8}
240,THE RETREAT.,"A second nature, to exist in pain"
241,THE RETREAT.,As in its own allotted element.
242,THE RETREAT.,
243,THE RETREAT.,10.
244,THE RETREAT.,Such strength the will reveal'd had given
245,THE RETREAT.,"This holy pair, such influxes of grace,"
246,THE RETREAT.,That to their solitary resting place
247,THE RETREAT.,They brought the peace of Heaven.
248,THE RETREAT.,"Yea all around was hallowed! Danger, Fear,"
249,THE RETREAT.,Nor thought of evil ever entered here.
250,THE RETREAT.,A charm was on the Leopard when he came
251,THE RETREAT.,Within the circle of that mystic glade;
252,THE RETREAT.,"Submiss he crouch'd before the heavenly maid,"
253,THE RETREAT.,And offered to her touch his speckled side;
254,THE RETREAT.,"Or with arch'd back erect, and bending head,"
255,THE RETREAT.,"And eyes half-clos'd for pleasure, would he stand,"
256,THE RETREAT.,Courting the pressure of her gentle hand.
257,THE RETREAT.,
258,THE RETREAT.,11.
259,THE RETREAT.,"Trampling his path through wood and brake,"
260,THE RETREAT.,"And canes which crackling fall before his way,"
261,THE RETREAT.,"And tassel-grass, whose silvery feathers play"
262,THE RETREAT.,"O'ertopping the young trees,"
263,THE RETREAT.,"On comes the Elephant, to slake"
264,THE RETREAT.,{9}
265,THE RETREAT.,His thirst at noon in yon pellucid springs.
266,THE RETREAT.,"Lo! from his trunk upturn'd, aloft he flings"
267,THE RETREAT.,The grateful shower; and now
268,THE RETREAT.,Plucking the broad-leav'd bough
269,THE RETREAT.,"Of yonder plane, with waving motion slow,"
270,THE RETREAT.,"Fanning the languid air,"
271,THE RETREAT.,He moves it to and fro.
272,THE RETREAT.,"But when that form of beauty meets his sight,"
273,THE RETREAT.,"The trunk its undulating motion stops,"
274,THE RETREAT.,"From his forgetful hold the plane-branch drops,"
275,THE RETREAT.,"Reverent he kneels, and lifts his rational eyes"
276,THE RETREAT.,To her as if in prayer;
277,THE RETREAT.,"And when she pours her angel voice in song,"
278,THE RETREAT.,"Entranced he listens to the thrilling notes,"
279,THE RETREAT.,"Till his strong temples, bath'd with sudden dews,"
280,THE RETREAT.,Their fragrance of delight and love diffuse.
281,THE RETREAT.,
282,THE RETREAT.,12.
283,THE RETREAT.,"Lo! as the voice melodious floats around,"
284,THE RETREAT.,"The Antelope draws near,"
285,THE RETREAT.,"The Tygress leaves her toothless cubs to hear,"
286,THE RETREAT.,"The Snake comes gliding from the secret brake,"
287,THE RETREAT.,Himself in fascination forced along
288,THE RETREAT.,By that enchanting song;
289,THE RETREAT.,{10}
290,THE RETREAT.,"The antic Monkies, whose wild gambols late,"
291,THE RETREAT.,"When not a breeze wav'd the tall jungle-grass,"
292,THE RETREAT.,"Shook the whole wood, are hush'd, and silently"
293,THE RETREAT.,Hang on the cluster'd trees.
294,THE RETREAT.,All things in wonder and delight are still;
295,THE RETREAT.,"Only at times the Nightingale is heard,"
296,THE RETREAT.,Not that in emulous skill that sweetest bird
297,THE RETREAT.,"Her rival strain would try,"
298,THE RETREAT.,"A mighty songster, with the Maid to vie;"
299,THE RETREAT.,She only bore her part in powerful sympathy.
300,THE RETREAT.,
301,THE RETREAT.,13.
302,THE RETREAT.,Well might they thus adore that heavenly Maid!
303,THE RETREAT.,"For never Nymph of Mountain,"
304,THE RETREAT.,"Or Grove, or Lake, or Fountain,"
305,THE RETREAT.,With a diviner presence fill'd the shade.
306,THE RETREAT.,No idle ornaments deface
307,THE RETREAT.,"Her natural grace,"
308,THE RETREAT.,"Musk-spot, nor sandal-streak, nor scarlet stain,"
309,THE RETREAT.,"Ear-drop nor chain, nor arm nor ankle-ring,"
310,THE RETREAT.,"Nor trinketry on front, or neck, or breast,"
311,THE RETREAT.,Marring the perfect form: she seem'd a thing
312,THE RETREAT.,"Of Heaven's prime uncorrupted work, a child"
313,THE RETREAT.,"Of early Nature undefil'd,"
314,THE RETREAT.,{11}
315,THE RETREAT.,A daughter of the years of innocence.
316,THE RETREAT.,And therefore all things lov'd her. When she stood
317,THE RETREAT.,"Beside the glassy pool, the fish, that flies"
318,THE RETREAT.,"Quick as an arrow from all other eyes,"
319,THE RETREAT.,"Hover'd to gaze on her. The mother bird,"
320,THE RETREAT.,"When Kailyal's steps she heard,"
321,THE RETREAT.,"Sought not to tempt her from her secret nest,"
322,THE RETREAT.,"But, hastening to the dear retreat, would fly"
323,THE RETREAT.,To meet and welcome her benignant eye.
324,THE RETREAT.,
325,THE RETREAT.,14.
326,THE RETREAT.,"Hope we have none, said Kailyal to her Sire."
327,THE RETREAT.,Said she aright? and had the Mortal Maid
328,THE RETREAT.,"No thoughts of heavenly aid, . ."
329,THE RETREAT.,No secret hopes her inmost heart to move
330,THE RETREAT.,"With longings of such deep and pure desire,"
331,THE RETREAT.,"As vestal Maids, whose piety is love,"
332,THE RETREAT.,"Feel in their extasies, when rapt above,"
333,THE RETREAT.,Their souls unto their heavenly Spouse aspire?
334,THE RETREAT.,Why else so often doth that searching eye
335,THE RETREAT.,Roam through the scope of sky?
336,THE RETREAT.,"Why, if she sees a distant speck on high,"
337,THE RETREAT.,Starts there that quick suffusion to her cheek?
338,THE RETREAT.,"'Tis but the Eagle, in his heavenly height;"
339,THE RETREAT.,{12}
340,THE RETREAT.,"Reluctant to believe, she hears his cry,"
341,THE RETREAT.,"And marks his wheeling flight,"
342,THE RETREAT.,Then languidly averts her mournful sight.
343,THE RETREAT.,"Why ever else, at morn, that waking sigh,"
344,THE RETREAT.,Because the lovely form no more is nigh
345,THE RETREAT.,Which hath been present to her soul all night;
346,THE RETREAT.,And that injurious fear
347,THE RETREAT.,"Which ever, as it riseth, is represt,"
348,THE RETREAT.,"Yet riseth still within her troubled breast,"
349,THE RETREAT.,That she no more shall see the Glendoveer!
350,THE RETREAT.,
351,THE RETREAT.,15.
352,THE RETREAT.,Hath he forgotten me? The wrongful thought
353,THE RETREAT.,"Would stir within her, and, though still repell'd"
354,THE RETREAT.,"With shame and self-reproaches, would recur."
355,THE RETREAT.,"Days after days unvarying come and go,"
356,THE RETREAT.,And neither friend nor foe
357,THE RETREAT.,Approaches them in their sequestered bower.
358,THE RETREAT.,Maid of strange destiny! but think not thou
359,THE RETREAT.,"Thou art forgotten now,"
360,THE RETREAT.,And hast no cause for farther hope or fear.
361,THE RETREAT.,"High-fated Maid, thou dost not know"
362,THE RETREAT.,What eyes watch over thee for weal and woe!
363,THE RETREAT.,"Even at this hour,"
364,THE RETREAT.,{13}
365,THE RETREAT.,"Searching the dark decrees divine,"
366,THE RETREAT.,"Kehama, in the fulness of his power,"
367,THE RETREAT.,Perceives his thread of fate entwin'd with thine.
368,THE RETREAT.,"The Glendoveer, from his far sphere,"
369,THE RETREAT.,"With love that never sleeps, beholds thee here,"
370,THE RETREAT.,"And, in the hour permitted, will be near."
371,THE RETREAT.,"Dark Lorrinite on thee hath fix'd her sight,"
372,THE RETREAT.,"And laid her wiles, to aid"
373,THE RETREAT.,Foul Arvalan when he shall next appear;
374,THE RETREAT.,For well she ween'd his Spirit would renew
375,THE RETREAT.,"Old vengeance now, with unremitting hate;"
376,THE RETREAT.,"The Enchantress well that evil nature knew,"
377,THE RETREAT.,"The accursed Spirit hath his prey in view,"
378,THE RETREAT.,"And thus, while all their separate hopes pursue,"
379,THE RETREAT.,"All work, unconsciously, the will of Fate."
380,THE RETREAT.,
381,THE RETREAT.,16.
382,THE RETREAT.,Fate work'd its own the while. A band
383,THE RETREAT.,"Of Yoguees, as they roam'd the land,"
384,THE RETREAT.,"Seeking a spouse for Jaga-Naut their God,"
385,THE RETREAT.,"Stray'd to this solitary glade,"
386,THE RETREAT.,And reach'd the bower wherein the Maid abode.
387,THE RETREAT.,"Wondering at form so fair, they deem'd the power"
388,THE RETREAT.,"Divine had led them to his chosen bride,"
389,THE RETREAT.,And seiz'd and bore her from her father's side.

403,JAGA-NAUT.,"Seeking the fairest and the best,"
404,JAGA-NAUT.,No maid so lovely might they hope to find; . .
405,JAGA-NAUT.,"For she hath breath'd celestial air,"
406,JAGA-NAUT.,"And heavenly food hath been her fare,"
407,JAGA-NAUT.,And heavenly thoughts and feelings give her face

438,JAGA-NAUT.,"Uprear'd on twenty wheels elate,"
439,JAGA-NAUT.,"Huge as a Ship, the bridal car appear'd;"
440,JAGA-NAUT.,"Loud creak its ponderous wheels, as through the gate"
441,JAGA-NAUT.,A thousand Bramins drag the enormous load.
442,JAGA-NAUT.,"There, thron'd aloft in state,"
443,JAGA-NAUT.,The image of the seven-headed God
444,JAGA-NAUT.,Came forth from his abode; and at his side
445,JAGA-NAUT.,Sate Kailyal like a bride;
446,JAGA-NAUT.,"A bridal statue rather might she seem,"
447,JAGA-NAUT.,"For she regarded all things like a dream,"
448,JAGA-NAUT.,"Having no thought, nor fear, nor will, nor aught"
449,JAGA-NAUT.,"Save hope and faith, that liv'd within her still."
450,JAGA-NAUT.,

452,JAGA-NAUT.,"O silent Night, how have they startled thee"
453,JAGA-NAUT.,With the brazen trumpet's blare!
454,JAGA-NAUT.,"And thou, O Moon! whose quiet light serene"
455,JAGA-NAUT.,"Filleth wide heaven, and bathing hill and wood,"
456,JAGA-NAUT.,"Spreads o'er the peaceful valley like a flood,"
457,JAGA-NAUT.,"How have they dimm'd thee with the torches' glare,"
458,JAGA-NAUT.,"Which round yon moving pageant flame and flare,"
459,JAGA-NAUT.,"As the wild rout, with deafening song and shout,"
460,JAGA-NAUT.,"Fling their long flashes out,"
461,JAGA-NAUT.,"That, like infernal lightnings, fire the air."

466,JAGA-NAUT.,A thousand pilgrims strain
467,JAGA-NAUT.,"Arm, shoulder, breast and thigh, with might and main,"
468,JAGA-NAUT.,"To drag that sacred wain,"
469,JAGA-NAUT.,And scarce can draw along the enormous load.
470,JAGA-NAUT.,"Prone fall the frantic votaries in its road,"
471,JAGA-NAUT.,"And, calling on the God,"
472,JAGA-NAUT.,Their self-devoted bodies there they lay
473,JAGA-NAUT.,To pave his chariot-way.
474,JAGA-NAUT.,"On Jaga-Naut they call,"
475,JAGA-NAUT.,"The ponderous Car rolls on, and crushes all."
476,JAGA-NAUT.,Through blood and bones it ploughs its dreadful path.
477,JAGA-NAUT.,"Groans rise unheard; the dying cry,"
478,JAGA-NAUT.,And death and agony
479,JAGA-NAUT.,"Are trodden under foot by yon mad throng,"
480,JAGA-NAUT.,"Who follow close, and thrust the deadly wheels along."
481,JAGA-NAUT.,
482,JAGA-NAUT.,6.
483,JAGA-NAUT.,Pale grows the Maid at this accursed sight;
484,JAGA-NAUT.,The yells which round her rise
485,JAGA-NAUT.,"Have rous'd her with affright,"
486,JAGA-NAUT.,And fear hath given to her dilated eyes
487,JAGA-NAUT.,A wilder light.
488,JAGA-NAUT.,Where shall those eyes be turn'd? she knows not where!
489,JAGA-NAUT.,{18}
490,JAGA-NAUT.,"Downward they dare not look, for there"
491,JAGA-NAUT.,"Is death and horror, and despair;"
492,JAGA-NAUT.,"Nor can her patient looks to Heaven repair,"
493,JAGA-NAUT.,"For the huge Idol over her, in air,"
494,JAGA-NAUT.,"Spreads his seven hideous heads, and wide"
495,JAGA-NAUT.,Extends their snaky necks on every side;
496,JAGA-NAUT.,"And all around, behind, before,"
497,JAGA-NAUT.,"The bridal Car, is the raging rout,"
498,JAGA-NAUT.,"With frantic shout, and deafening roar,"
499,JAGA-NAUT.,Tossing the torches' flames about.
500,JAGA-NAUT.,"And the double double peals of the drum are there,"
501,JAGA-NAUT.,And the startling burst of the trumpet's blare;
502,JAGA-NAUT.,"And the gong, that seems, with its thunders dread,"
503,JAGA-NAUT.,"To stun the living, and waken the dead."
504,JAGA-NAUT.,"The ear-strings throb as if they were broke,"
505,JAGA-NAUT.,And the eye-lids drop at the weight of its stroke.
506,JAGA-NAUT.,"Fain would the Maid have kept them fast,"
507,JAGA-NAUT.,But open they start at the crack of the blast.
508,JAGA-NAUT.,
509,JAGA-NAUT.,7.
510,JAGA-NAUT.,"Where art thou, Son of Heaven, Ereenia! where"
511,JAGA-NAUT.,In this dread hour of horror and despair?
512,JAGA-NAUT.,"Thinking on him, she strove her fear to quell,"
513,JAGA-NAUT.,"If he be near me, then will all be well;"
514,JAGA-NAUT.,"And, if he reck not for my misery,"
515,JAGA-NAUT.,{19}
516,JAGA-NAUT.,"Let come the worst, it matters not to me."
517,JAGA-NAUT.,"Repel that wrongful thought,"
518,JAGA-NAUT.,"O Maid! thou feelest, but believ'st it not;"
519,JAGA-NAUT.,It is thine own imperfect nature's fault
520,JAGA-NAUT.,That lets one doubt of him arise within.
521,JAGA-NAUT.,"And this the Virgin knew; and, like a sin,"
522,JAGA-NAUT.,"Repell'd the thought, and still believ'd him true;"
523,JAGA-NAUT.,And summoned up her spirit to endure
524,JAGA-NAUT.,"All forms of fear, in that firm trust secure."
525,JAGA-NAUT.,
526,JAGA-NAUT.,8.
527,JAGA-NAUT.,"She needs that faith, she needs that consolation,"
528,JAGA-NAUT.,For now the Car hath measured back its track
529,JAGA-NAUT.,"Of death, and hath re-entered now its station."
530,JAGA-NAUT.,"There, in the Temple-court, with song and dance,"
531,JAGA-NAUT.,"A harlot-band, to meet the Maid, advance."
532,JAGA-NAUT.,The drum hath ceas'd its peals; the trump and gong
533,JAGA-NAUT.,Are still; the frantic crowd forbear their yells;
534,JAGA-NAUT.,"And sweet it was to hear the voice of song,"
535,JAGA-NAUT.,"And the sweet music of their girdle-bells,"
536,JAGA-NAUT.,"Armlets and anklets, that, with chearful sounds"
537,JAGA-NAUT.,Symphonious tinkled as they wheel'd around.
538,JAGA-NAUT.,
539,JAGA-NAUT.,9.
540,JAGA-NAUT.,"They sung a bridal measure,"
541,JAGA-NAUT.,{20}
542,JAGA-NAUT.,"A song of pleasure,"
543,JAGA-NAUT.,A hymn of joyaunce and of gratulation.
544,JAGA-NAUT.,"Go, chosen One, they cried,"
545,JAGA-NAUT.,"Go, happy bride!"
546,JAGA-NAUT.,For thee the God descends in expectation;
547,JAGA-NAUT.,For thy dear sake
548,JAGA-NAUT.,"He leaves his heaven, O Maid of matchless charms."
549,JAGA-NAUT.,"Go, happy One, the bed divine partake,"
550,JAGA-NAUT.,And fill his longing arms!
551,JAGA-NAUT.,"Thus to the inner fane,"
552,JAGA-NAUT.,"With circling dance and hymeneal strain,"
553,JAGA-NAUT.,"The astonish'd Maid they led,"
554,JAGA-NAUT.,And there they laid her on the bridal bed.
555,JAGA-NAUT.,"Then forth they went, and clos'd the Temple-gate,"
556,JAGA-NAUT.,And left the wretched Kailyal to her fate.
557,JAGA-NAUT.,
558,JAGA-NAUT.,10.
559,JAGA-NAUT.,"Where art thou, Son of Heaven, Ereenia, where?"
560,JAGA-NAUT.,"From the loathed bed she starts, and in the air"
561,JAGA-NAUT.,"Looks up, as if she thought to find him there!"
562,JAGA-NAUT.,"Then, in despair,"
563,JAGA-NAUT.,"Anguish and agony, and hopeless prayer,"
564,JAGA-NAUT.,Prostrate she laid herself upon the floor.
565,JAGA-NAUT.,"There, trembling as she lay,"
566,JAGA-NAUT.,{21}
567,JAGA-NAUT.,The Bramin of the fane advanced
568,JAGA-NAUT.,And came to seize his prey.
569,JAGA-NAUT.,
570,JAGA-NAUT.,11.
571,JAGA-NAUT.,"But as the Priest drew nigh,"
572,JAGA-NAUT.,A power invisible opposed his way;
573,JAGA-NAUT.,"Starting, he uttered wildly a death-cry,"
574,JAGA-NAUT.,And fell. At that the Maid all eagerly
575,JAGA-NAUT.,Lifted in hope her head;
576,JAGA-NAUT.,She thought her own deliverer had been near;
577,JAGA-NAUT.,"When lo! with other life re-animate,"
578,JAGA-NAUT.,"She saw the dead arise,"
579,JAGA-NAUT.,"And in the fiendish joy within his eyes,"
580,JAGA-NAUT.,She knew the hateful Spirit who look'd through
581,JAGA-NAUT.,"Their specular orbs, . . cloth'd in the flesh of man"
582,JAGA-NAUT.,She knew the accursed soul of Arvalan.
583,JAGA-NAUT.,
584,JAGA-NAUT.,12.
585,JAGA-NAUT.,"But not in vain, with the sudden shriek of fear,"
586,JAGA-NAUT.,She calls Ereenia now; the Glendoveer
587,JAGA-NAUT.,Is here! Upon the guilty sight he burst
588,JAGA-NAUT.,"Like lightning from a cloud, and caught the accurst,"
589,JAGA-NAUT.,"Bore him to the roof aloft, and on the floor"
590,JAGA-NAUT.,"With vengeance dash'd him, quivering there in gore."
591,JAGA-NAUT.,
592,JAGA-NAUT.,{22}
593,JAGA-NAUT.,
594,JAGA-NAUT.,13.
595,JAGA-NAUT.,"Lo! from the pregnant air, . . heart-withering sight!"
596,JAGA-NAUT.,"There issued forth the dreadful Lorrinite,"
597,JAGA-NAUT.,Seize him! the Enchantress cried;
598,JAGA-NAUT.,"A host of Demons at her word appear,"
599,JAGA-NAUT.,"And like tornado winds, from every side"
600,JAGA-NAUT.,"At once, they rush upon the Glendoveer."
601,JAGA-NAUT.,"Alone against a legion, little here"
602,JAGA-NAUT.,"Avails his single might,"
603,JAGA-NAUT.,"Nor that celestial faulchion, which in fight"
604,JAGA-NAUT.,So oft had put the rebel race to flight.
605,JAGA-NAUT.,There are no Gods on earth to give him aid;
606,JAGA-NAUT.,"Hemm'd round, he is overpower'd, beat down, and bound,"
607,JAGA-NAUT.,And at the feet of Lorrinite is laid.
608,JAGA-NAUT.,
609,JAGA-NAUT.,14.
610,JAGA-NAUT.,"Meantime the scattered members of the slain,"
611,JAGA-NAUT.,"Obedient to her mighty voice, assum'd"
612,JAGA-NAUT.,"Their vital form again,"
613,JAGA-NAUT.,"And that foul Spirit, upon vengeance bent,"
614,JAGA-NAUT.,Fled to the fleshly tenement.
615,JAGA-NAUT.,"Lo! here, quoth Lorrinite, thou seest thy foe!"
616,JAGA-NAUT.,"Him in the Ancient Sepulchres, below"
617,JAGA-NAUT.,"The billows of the Ocean, will I lay;"
618,JAGA-NAUT.,{23}
619,JAGA-NAUT.,"Gods are there none to help him now, and there"
620,JAGA-NAUT.,For Man there is no way.
621,JAGA-NAUT.,"To that dread scene of durance and despair,"
622,JAGA-NAUT.,"Asuras, bear your enemy! I go"
623,JAGA-NAUT.,"To chain him in the Tombs. Meantime do thou,"
624,JAGA-NAUT.,"Freed from thy foe, and now secure from fear,"
625,JAGA-NAUT.,"Son of Kehama, take thy pleasure here."
626,JAGA-NAUT.,
627,JAGA-NAUT.,15.
628,JAGA-NAUT.,Her words the accursed race obey'd;
629,JAGA-NAUT.,"Forth with a sound like rushing winds they fled,"
630,JAGA-NAUT.,"And of all aid from Earth or Heaven bereft,"
631,JAGA-NAUT.,Alone with Arvalan the Maid was left.
632,JAGA-NAUT.,"But in that hour of agony, the Maid"
633,JAGA-NAUT.,Deserted not herself; her very dread
634,JAGA-NAUT.,Had calm'd her; and her heart
635,JAGA-NAUT.,"Knew the whole horror, and its only part."
636,JAGA-NAUT.,"Yamen, receive me undefil'd! she said,"
637,JAGA-NAUT.,"And seiz'd a torch, and fir'd the bridal bed."
638,JAGA-NAUT.,Up ran the rapid flames; on every side
639,JAGA-NAUT.,"They find their fuel wheresoe'er they spread,"
640,JAGA-NAUT.,"Thin hangings, fragrant gums, and odorous wood,"
641,JAGA-NAUT.,That pil'd like sacrificial altars stood.
642,JAGA-NAUT.,"Around they run, and upward they aspire,"
643,JAGA-NAUT.,"And, lo! the huge Pagoda lin'd with fire."
644,JAGA-NAUT.,
645,JAGA-NAUT.,{24}
646,JAGA-NAUT.,
647,JAGA-NAUT.,16.
648,JAGA-NAUT.,"The wicked Soul, who had assum'd again"
649,JAGA-NAUT.,"A form of sensible flesh, for his foul will,"
650,JAGA-NAUT.,"Still bent on base revenge, and baffled still,"
651,JAGA-NAUT.,Felt that corporeal shape alike to pain
652,JAGA-NAUT.,"Obnoxious as to pleasure; forth he flew,"
653,JAGA-NAUT.,Howling and scorch'd by the devouring flame;
654,JAGA-NAUT.,"Accursed Spirit! still condemn'd to rue,"
655,JAGA-NAUT.,The act of sin and punishment the same.
656,JAGA-NAUT.,"Freed from his loathsome touch, a natural dread"
657,JAGA-NAUT.,"Came on the self-devoted, and she drew"
658,JAGA-NAUT.,"Back from the flames, which now toward her spread,"
659,JAGA-NAUT.,"And, like a living monster, seem'd to dart"
660,JAGA-NAUT.,Their hungry tongues toward their shrinking prey.
661,JAGA-NAUT.,Soon she subdued her heart;
662,JAGA-NAUT.,"O Father! she exclaim'd, there was no way"
663,JAGA-NAUT.,"But this! and thou, Ereenia, who for me"
664,JAGA-NAUT.,"Sufferest, my soul shall bear thee company."
665,JAGA-NAUT.,
666,JAGA-NAUT.,17.
667,JAGA-NAUT.,"So having said, she knit"
668,JAGA-NAUT.,"Her body up to work her soul's desire,"
669,JAGA-NAUT.,And rush at once amid the thickest fire.
670,JAGA-NAUT.,"A sudden cry withheld her, . . Kailyal, stay!"
671,JAGA-NAUT.,{25}
672,JAGA-NAUT.,"Child! Daughter! I am here! the voice exclaims,"
673,JAGA-NAUT.,"And from the gate, unharm'd, through smoke and flames"
674,JAGA-NAUT.,"Like as a God, Ladurlad made his way;"
675,JAGA-NAUT.,"Wrapt his preserving arms around, and bore"
676,JAGA-NAUT.,"His Child, uninjur'd, o'er the burning floor."

749,LADURLAD.,"Short refuge from the noontide heat,"

781,LADURLAD.,"A glance of pity, in contemptuous mood,"
782,LADURLAD.,"He on the Dwarf cast down,"
783,LADURLAD.,"And bade him take the boon,"

787,LADURLAD.,"Lo, Son of giant birth,"

799,LADURLAD.,"Mighty art thou, O Lord of Earth and Heaven,"
800,LADURLAD.,"Mighty art thou! he said,"
801,LADURLAD.,"Be merciful, and let me be forgiven."
802,LADURLAD.,"He ask'd for mercy of the merciful,"
803,LADURLAD.,And mercy for his virtue's sake was shown.
804,LADURLAD.,"For though he was cast down to Padalon,"
805,LADURLAD.,"Yet there, by Yamen's throne,"
806,LADURLAD.,"Doth Baly sit in majesty and might,"
807,LADURLAD.,"To judge the dead, and sentence them aright."
808,LADURLAD.,And forasmuch as he was still the friend
809,LADURLAD.,"Of righteousness, it is permitted him,"
810,LADURLAD.,"Yearly, from those drear regions to ascend,"
811,LADURLAD.,"And walk the Earth, that he may hear his name"

830,LADURLAD.,Well might the sad beholder ween from thence
831,LADURLAD.,What works of wonder the devouring wave
832,LADURLAD.,"Had swallowed there, when monuments so brave"
833,LADURLAD.,Bore record of their old magnificence.
834,LADURLAD.,"And on the sandy shore, beside the verge"
835,LADURLAD.,"Of Ocean, here and there, a rock-hewn fane"
836,LADURLAD.,Resisted in its strength the surf and surge
837,LADURLAD.,That on their deep foundations beat in vain.
838,LADURLAD.,"In solitude the Ancient Temples stood,"
839,LADURLAD.,"Once resonant with instrument and song,"
840,LADURLAD.,And solemn dance of festive multitude;
841,LADURLAD.,"Now as the weary ages pass along,"
842,LADURLAD.,"No voice they hear, save of the Ocean flood,"
843,LADURLAD.,Which roars for ever on the restless shores;
844,LADURLAD.,"Or, visiting their solitary caves,"
845,LADURLAD.,"The lonely sound of Winds, that moan around"
846,LADURLAD.,Accordant to the melancholy waves.
847,LADURLAD.,
848,LADURLAD.,8.
849,LADURLAD.,With reverence did the travellers see
850,LADURLAD.,{33}
851,LADURLAD.,"The works of ancient days, and silently"
852,LADURLAD.,"Approach the shore. Now on the yellow sand,"
853,LADURLAD.,"Where round their feet the rising surges part,"
854,LADURLAD.,They stand. Ladurlad's heart
855,LADURLAD.,Exulted in his wonderous destiny.
856,LADURLAD.,To Heaven he rais'd his hand
857,LADURLAD.,In attitude of stern heroic pride;
858,LADURLAD.,"Oh what a power, he cried,"
859,LADURLAD.,"Thou dreadful Rajah, doth thy Curse impart!"
860,LADURLAD.,"I thank thee now! . . Then turning to the Maid,"
861,LADURLAD.,Thou see'st how far and wide
862,LADURLAD.,"Yon Towers extend, he said,"
863,LADURLAD.,My search must needs be long. Meantime the flood
864,LADURLAD.,"Will cast thee up thy food, . ."
865,LADURLAD.,"And in the Chambers of the Rock by night,"
866,LADURLAD.,"Take thou thy safe abode,"
867,LADURLAD.,"No prowling beast to harm thee, or affright,"
868,LADURLAD.,Can enter there; but wrap thyself with care
869,LADURLAD.,From the foul Bird obscene that thirsts for blood;
870,LADURLAD.,For in such caverns doth the Bat delight
871,LADURLAD.,"To have its haunts. Do thou with stone and shout,"
872,LADURLAD.,"Ere thou liest down at evening, scare them out,"
873,LADURLAD.,And in this robe of mine involve thy feet.
874,LADURLAD.,"Duly commend us both to Heaven in prayer,"
875,LADURLAD.,{34}
876,LADURLAD.,"Be of good heart, and let thy sleep be sweet."
877,LADURLAD.,
878,LADURLAD.,9.
879,LADURLAD.,"So saying, he put back his arm, and gave"
880,LADURLAD.,"The cloth which girt his loins, and prest her hand"
881,LADURLAD.,"With fervent love, then down the sloping sand"
882,LADURLAD.,"Advanced into the sea: the coming Wave,"
883,LADURLAD.,"Which knew Kehama's Curse, before his way"
884,LADURLAD.,"Started, and on he went as on dry land,"
885,LADURLAD.,And still around his path the waters parted.
886,LADURLAD.,"She stands upon the shore, where sea-weeds play,"
887,LADURLAD.,"Lashing her polish'd ankles, and the spray"
888,LADURLAD.,"Which off her Father, like a rainbow, fled,"
889,LADURLAD.,"Falls on her like a shower; there Kailyal stands,"
890,LADURLAD.,And sees the billows rise above his head.
891,LADURLAD.,"She, at the startling sight, forgot the power"
892,LADURLAD.,"The Curse had given him, and held forth her hands"
893,LADURLAD.,"Imploringly, . . . her voice was on the wind,"
894,LADURLAD.,And the deaf Ocean o'er Ladurlad clos'd.
895,LADURLAD.,"Soon she recall'd his destiny to mind,"
896,LADURLAD.,"And, shaking off that natural fear, compos'd"
897,LADURLAD.,"Her soul with prayer, to wait the event resign'd."
898,LADURLAD.,
899,LADURLAD.,10.
900,LADURLAD.,"Alone, upon the solitary strand,"
901,LADURLAD.,{35}
902,LADURLAD.,"The lovely one is left; behold her go,"
903,LADURLAD.,"Pacing with patient footsteps, to and fro,"
904,LADURLAD.,Along the bending sand.
905,LADURLAD.,"Save her, ye Gods! from Evil Powers, and here"
906,LADURLAD.,From man she need not fear;
907,LADURLAD.,For never Traveller comes near
908,LADURLAD.,"These awful ruins of the days of yore,"
909,LADURLAD.,"Nor fisher's bark, nor venturous mariner,"
910,LADURLAD.,Approach the sacred shore.
911,LADURLAD.,"All day she walk'd the beach, at night she sought"
912,LADURLAD.,The Chamber of the Rock; with stone and shout
913,LADURLAD.,"Assail'd the Bats obscene, and scar'd them out;"
914,LADURLAD.,"Then in her Father's robe involv'd her feet,"
915,LADURLAD.,"And wrapt her mantle round to guard her head,"
916,LADURLAD.,"And laid her down: the rock was Kailyal's bed,"
917,LADURLAD.,"Her chamber-lamps were in the starry sky,"
918,LADURLAD.,The winds and waters were her lullaby.
919,LADURLAD.,
920,LADURLAD.,11.
921,LADURLAD.,"Be of good heart, and let thy sleep be sweet,"
922,LADURLAD.,"Ladurlad said, . . Alas! that cannot be"
923,LADURLAD.,To one whose days are days of misery.
924,LADURLAD.,How often did she stretch her hands to greet
925,LADURLAD.,"Ereenia, rescued in the dreams of night!"
926,LADURLAD.,{36}
927,LADURLAD.,"How oft amid the vision of delight,"
928,LADURLAD.,Fear in her heart all is not as it seems;
929,LADURLAD.,"Then from unsettled slumber start, and hear"
930,LADURLAD.,"The Winds that moan above, the Waves below!"
931,LADURLAD.,"Thou hast been call'd, O Sleep! the friend of Woe,"
932,LADURLAD.,But 'tis the happy who have call'd thee so.
933,LADURLAD.,
934,LADURLAD.,12.
935,LADURLAD.,"Another day, another night are gone,"
936,LADURLAD.,"A second passes, and a third wanes on."
937,LADURLAD.,"So long she paced the shore,"
938,LADURLAD.,"So often on the beach she took her stand,"
939,LADURLAD.,"That the wild Sea-Birds knew her, and no more"
940,LADURLAD.,"Fled, when she past beside them on the strand."
941,LADURLAD.,Bright shine the golden summits in the light
942,LADURLAD.,"Of the noon-sun, and lovelier far by night"
943,LADURLAD.,Their moonlight glories o'er the sea they shed:
944,LADURLAD.,Fair is the dark-green deep; by night and day
945,LADURLAD.,"Unvex'd with storms, the peaceful billows play,"
946,LADURLAD.,As when they clos'd upon Ladurlad's head:
947,LADURLAD.,The firmament above is bright and clear;
948,LADURLAD.,"The sea-fowl, lords of water, air, and land,"
949,LADURLAD.,"Joyous alike upon the wing appear,"
950,LADURLAD.,"Or when they ride the waves, or walk the sand;"
951,LADURLAD.,{37}
952,LADURLAD.,Beauty and light and joy are every-where;
953,LADURLAD.,"There is no sadness and no sorrow here,"
954,LADURLAD.,"Save what that single human breast contains,"
955,LADURLAD.,"But oh! what hopes, and fears, and pains are there!"
956,LADURLAD.,
957,LADURLAD.,13.
958,LADURLAD.,"Seven miserable days the expectant Maid,"
959,LADURLAD.,"From earliest dawn till evening, watch'd the shore;"
960,LADURLAD.,"Hope left her then; and in her heart she said,"
961,LADURLAD.,Never shall I behold my Father more!

968,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
969,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,1.
970,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,When the broad Ocean on Ladurlad's head
971,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Had clos'd and arch'd him o'er,"
972,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,With steady tread he held his way
973,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Adown the sloping shore.
974,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The dark-green waves, with emerald hue,"
975,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Imbue the beams of day,"
976,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And on the wrinkled sand below,"
977,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Rolling their mazy network to and fro,"
978,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Light shadows shift and play.
979,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The hungry Shark, at scent of prey,"
980,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Toward Ladurlad darted;
981,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Beholding then that human form erect,"
982,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{39}
983,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"How like a God the depths he trod,"
984,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Appall'd the monster started,"
985,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And in his fear departed.
986,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Onward Ladurlad went with heart elate,"
987,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And now hath reach'd the Ancient City's gate.
988,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
989,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,2.
990,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Wondering, he stood awhile to gaze"
991,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Upon the works of elder days.
992,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The brazen portals open stood,"
993,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Even as the fearful multitude
994,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Had left them, when they fled"
995,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Before the rising flood.
996,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"High over-head, sublime,"
997,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The mighty gateway's storied roof was spread,"
998,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Dwarfing the puny piles of younger time.
999,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,With the deeds of days of yore
1000,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"That ample roof was sculptur'd o'er,"
1001,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And many a godlike form there met his eye,"
1002,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And many an emblem dark of mystery.
1003,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Through these wide portals oft had Baly rode
1004,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Triumphant from his proud abode,"
1005,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"When, in his greatness, he bestrode"
1006,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The Aullay, hugest of four-footed kind,"
1007,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{40}
1008,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The Aullay-Horse, that in his force,"
1009,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With elephantine trunk, could bind"
1010,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And lift the elephant, and on the wind"
1011,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Whirl him away, with sway and swing,"
1012,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Even like a pebble from the practis'd sling.
1013,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1014,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,3.
1015,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Those streets which never, since the days of yore,"
1016,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,By human footstep had been visited;
1017,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Those streets; which never more
1018,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"A human foot shall tread,"
1019,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Ladurlad trod. In sun-light, and sea-green,"
1020,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The thousand palaces were seen
1021,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of that proud city, whose superb abodes"
1022,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Seem'd rear'd by Giants for the immortal Gods.
1023,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"How silent and how beautiful they stand,"
1024,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Like things of Nature! the eternal rocks
1025,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Themselves not firmer. Neither hath the sand
1026,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Drifted within their gates, and choak'd their doors,"
1027,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Nor slime defil'd their pavements and their floors.
1028,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Did then the Ocean wage
1029,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His war for love and envy, not in rage,"
1030,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"O thou fair City, that he spares thee thus?"
1031,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Art thou Varounin's capital and court,"
1032,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{41}
1033,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Where all the Sea-Gods for delight resort,"
1034,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"A place too godlike to be held by us,"
1035,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The poor degenerate children of the Earth?
1036,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"So thought Ladurlad, as he look'd around,"
1037,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Weening to hear the sound
1038,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of Mermaid's shell, and song"
1039,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of choral throng from some imperial hall,"
1040,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Wherein the Immortal Powers, at festival,"
1041,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Their high carousals keep.
1042,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"But all is silence dread,"
1043,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Silence profound and dead,"
1044,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The everlasting stillness of the Deep.
1045,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1046,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,4.
1047,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Through many a solitary street,"
1048,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And silent market-place, and lonely square,"
1049,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Arm'd with the mighty Curse, behold him fare."
1050,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And now his feet attain that royal fane
1051,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Where Baly held of old his awful reign.
1052,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"What once had been the Garden spread around,"
1053,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Fair Gardens, once which wore perpetual green,"
1054,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Where all sweet flowers through all the year were found,"
1055,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And all fair fruits were through all seasons seen;
1056,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"A place of Paradise, where each device"
1057,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{42}
1058,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Of emulous Art with Nature strove to vie;
1059,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And Nature, on her part,"
1060,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Call'd forth new powers wherewith to vanquish Art.
1061,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The Swerga-God himself, with envious eye,"
1062,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Survey'd those peerless gardens in their prime;
1063,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Nor ever did the Lord of Light,"
1064,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Who circles Earth and Heaven upon his way,"
1065,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Behold from eldest time a goodlier sight
1066,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Than were the groves which Baly, in his might,"
1067,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Made for his chosen place of solace and delight.
1068,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1069,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,5.
1070,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"It was a Garden still beyond all price,"
1071,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Even yet it was a place of Paradise;
1072,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"For where the mighty Ocean could not spare,"
1073,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"There had he, with his own creation,"
1074,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Sought to repair his work of devastation.
1075,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And here were coral bowers,"
1076,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And grots of madrepores,"
1077,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And banks of spunge, as soft and fair to eye"
1078,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,As e'er was mossy bed
1079,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Whereon the Wood Nymphs lie
1080,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,With languid limbs in summer's sultry hours.
1081,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Here, too, were living flowers"
1082,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{43}
1083,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Which, like a bud compacted,"
1084,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Their purple cups contracted,"
1085,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And now in open blossom spread,"
1086,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Stretch'd like green anthers many a seeking head.
1087,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And arborets of jointed stone were there,"
1088,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And plants of fibres fine, as silkworm's thread;"
1089,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Yea, beautiful as Mermaid's golden hair"
1090,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Upon the waves dispread:
1091,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Others that, like the broad banana growing,"
1092,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Rais'd their long wrinkled leaves of purple hue,"
1093,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Like streamers wide out-flowing.
1094,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And whatsoe'er the depths of Ocean hide
1095,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"From human eyes, Ladurlad there espied,"
1096,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Trees of the deep, and shrubs and fruits and flowers,"
1097,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"As fair as ours,"
1098,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Wherewith the Sea-Nymphs love their locks to braid,"
1099,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"When to their father's hall, at festival"
1100,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Repairing, they, in emulous array,"
1101,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Their charms display,"
1102,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"To grace the banquet, and the solemn day."
1103,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1104,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,6.
1105,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The golden fountains had not ceas'd to flow,"
1106,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And, where they mingled with the briny Sea,"
1107,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{44}
1108,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"There was a sight of wonder and delight,"
1109,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"To see the fish, like birds in air,"
1110,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Above Ladurlad flying.
1111,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Round those strange waters they repair,"
1112,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Their scarlet fins outspread and plying,"
1113,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,They float with gentle hovering there;
1114,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And now upon those little wings,"
1115,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"As if to dare forbidden things,"
1116,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With wilful purpose bent,"
1117,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Swift as an arrow from a bow
1118,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"They dash across, and to and fro,"
1119,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"In rapid glance, like lightning go"
1120,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Through that unwonted element.
1121,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Almost in scenes so wonderous fair,"
1122,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Ladurlad had forgot
1123,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The mighty cause which led him there;
1124,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His busy eye was every where,"
1125,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,His mind had lost all thought;
1126,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His heart, surrendered to the joys"
1127,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of sight, was happy as a boy's."
1128,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,But soon the awakening thought recurs
1129,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of him who, in the Sepulchres,"
1130,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Hopeless of human aid, in chains is laid;"
1131,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And her who, on the solitary shore,"
1132,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{45}
1133,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"By night and day her weary watch will keep,"
1134,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Till she shall see them issuing from the deep.
1135,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1136,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,7.
1137,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Now hath Ladurlad reach'd the Court
1138,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Of the great Palace of the King; its floor
1139,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Was of the marble rock; and there before
1140,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The imperial door,"
1141,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"A mighty Image on the steps was seen,"
1142,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of stature huge, of countenance serene."
1143,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,A crown and sceptre at his feet were laid;
1144,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"One hand a scroll display'd,"
1145,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The other pointed there, that all might see;"
1146,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"My name is Death, it said,"
1147,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,In mercy have the Gods appointed me.
1148,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Two brazen gates beneath him, night and day"
1149,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Stood open; and within them you behold
1150,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Descending steps, which in the living stone"
1151,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Were hewn, a spacious way"
1152,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Down to the Chambers of the Kings of old.
1153,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1154,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,8.
1155,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Trembling with hope, the adventurous man descended"
1156,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The sea-green light of day
1157,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{46}
1158,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Not far along the vault extended;
1159,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"But where the slant reflection ended,"
1160,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Another light was seen
1161,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of red and fiery hue,"
1162,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"That with the water blended,"
1163,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And gave the secrets of the Tombs to view.
1164,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1165,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,9.
1166,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Deep in the marble rock, the Hall"
1167,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of Death was hollowed out, a chamber wide,"
1168,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Low-roof'd, and long; on either side,"
1169,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Each in his own alcove, and on his throne,"
1170,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The Kings of old were seated: in his hand
1171,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Each held the sceptre of command,"
1172,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"From whence, across that scene of endless night,"
1173,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,A carbuncle diffused its everlasting light.
1174,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1175,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,10.
1176,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,So well had the embalmers done their part
1177,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With spice and precious unguents, to imbue"
1178,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The perfect corpse, that each had still the hue"
1179,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of living man, and every limb was still"
1180,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Supple and firm and full, as when of yore"
1181,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Its motion answered to the moving will.
1182,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{47}
1183,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The robes of royalty which once they wore,"
1184,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Long since had mouldered off and left them bare:
1185,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Naked upon their thrones behold them there,"
1186,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Statues of actual flesh, . . a fearful sight!"
1187,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Their large and rayless eyes
1188,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Dimly reflecting to that gem-born light,"
1189,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Glaz'd, fix'd, and meaningless, . . . yet, open wide,"
1190,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Their ghastly balls belied
1191,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The mockery of life in all beside.
1192,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1193,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,11.
1194,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"But if, amid these Chambers drear,"
1195,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Death were a sight of shuddering and of fear,"
1196,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Life was a thing of stranger horror here.
1197,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"For at the farther end, in yon alcove,"
1198,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Where Baly should have lain, had he obey'd"
1199,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Man's common lot, behold Ereenia laid."
1200,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Strong fetters link him to the rock; his eye
1201,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Now rolls and widens, as with effort vain"
1202,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"He strives to break the chain,"
1203,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Now seems to brood upon his misery.
1204,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Before him couch'd there lay
1205,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"One of the mighty monsters of the deep,"
1206,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Whom Lorrinite encountering on the way,"
1207,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{48}
1208,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"There station'd, his perpetual guard to keep;"
1209,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"In the sport of wanton power, she charm'd him there,"
1210,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,As if to mock the Glendoveer's despair.
1211,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Upward his form was human, save that here"
1212,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The skin was cover'd o'er with scale on scale
1213,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Compact, a panoply of natural mail."
1214,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His mouth, from ear to ear,"
1215,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Weapon'd with triple teeth, extended wide,"
1216,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And tusks on either side;
1217,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"A double snake below, he roll'd"
1218,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,His supple lengths behind in many a sinuous fold.
1219,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1220,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,12.
1221,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With red and kindling eye, the Beast beholds"
1222,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"A living man draw nigh,"
1223,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And, rising on his folds,"
1224,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"In hungry joy awaits the expected feast,"
1225,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His mouth half-open, and his teeth unsheath'd."
1226,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Then on he sprung, and in his scaly arms"
1227,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Seiz'd him, and fasten'd on his neck, to suck,"
1228,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With greedy lips, the warm life-blood: and sure"
1229,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"But for the mighty power of magic charms,"
1230,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"As easily as, in the blithesome hour"
1231,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of spring, a child doth crop the meadow flower,"
1232,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{49}
1233,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Piecemeal those claws
1234,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Had rent their victim, and those armed jaws"
1235,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Snapt him in twain. Naked Ladurlad stood,"
1236,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Yet fearless and unharm'd in this dread strife,"
1237,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,So well Kehama's Curse had charm'd his fated life.
1238,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1239,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,13.
1240,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"He too, . . . for anger, rising at the sight"
1241,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Of him he sought, in such strange thrall confin'd."
1242,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With desperate courage fir'd Ladurlad's mind, . . ."
1243,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"He, too, unto the fight himself addrest,"
1244,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And grappling breast to breast,"
1245,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With foot firm-planted stands,"
1246,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And seiz'd the monster's throat with both his hands.
1247,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Vainly, with throttling grasp, he prest"
1248,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The impenetrable scales;
1249,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And lo! the guard rose up, and round his foe,"
1250,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With gliding motion, wreath'd his lengthening coils,"
1251,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Then tighten'd all their folds with stress and strain.
1252,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Nought would the raging Tyger's strength avail
1253,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,If once involv'd within those mighty toils;
1254,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The arm'd Rhinoceros, so clasp'd, in vain"
1255,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Had trusted to his hide of rugged mail,"
1256,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His bones all broken, and the breath of life"
1257,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{50}
1258,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Crush'd from the lungs, in that unequal strife."
1259,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Again, and yet again, he sought to break"
1260,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The impassive limbs; but when the monster found
1261,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His utmost power was vain,"
1262,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"A moment he relax'd in every round,"
1263,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Then knit his coils again with closer strain,"
1264,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And, bearing forward, forced him to the ground."
1265,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1266,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,14.
1267,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Ereenia groan'd in anguish at the sight
1268,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Of this dread fight: once more the Glendoveer
1269,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Essay'd to break his bonds, and fear"
1270,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"For that brave spirit who had sought him here,"
1271,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Stung him to wilder strugglings. From the rock
1272,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"He rais'd himself half up, . . with might and main"
1273,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Pluck'd at the adamantine chain;
1274,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And now, with long and unrelaxing strain,"
1275,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"In obstinate effort of indignant strength,"
1276,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Labour'd and strove in vain;
1277,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Till his immortal sinews fail'd at length;
1278,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And yielding, with an inward groan, to fate,"
1279,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Despairingly, he let himself again"
1280,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Fall prostrate on his prison-bed of stone,"
1281,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Body and chain alike with lifeless weight.
1282,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1283,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{51}
1284,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1285,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,15.
1286,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Struggling they lay in mortal fray
1287,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"All day, while day was in our upper sphere,"
1288,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"For light of day,"
1289,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And natural darkness never entered here;
1290,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"All night, with unabated might,"
1291,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,They waged the unremitting fight.
1292,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"A second day, a second night,"
1293,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,With furious will they wrestled still.
1294,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The third came on, the fourth is gone;"
1295,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Another comes, another goes,"
1296,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And yet no respite, no repose;"
1297,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"But day and night, and night and day,"
1298,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Involv'd in mortal strife they lay;
1299,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Six days and nights have past away,"
1300,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And still they wage, with mutual rage,"
1301,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The unremitting fray.
1302,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With mutual rage their war they wage,"
1303,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,But not with mutual will;
1304,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"For when the seventh morning came,"
1305,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The monster's worn and wearied frame
1306,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,In this strange contest fails;
1307,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And weaker, weaker, every hour"
1308,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"He yields beneath strong Nature's power,"
1309,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{52}
1310,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,For now the Curse prevails.
1311,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1312,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,16.
1313,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Sometimes the Beast sprung up to bear
1314,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His foe aloft; and, trusting there"
1315,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"To shake him from his hold,"
1316,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Relax'd the rings that wreath'd him round;
1317,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"But on his throat Ladurlad hung,"
1318,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And weigh'd him to the ground;
1319,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And if they sink, or if they float,"
1320,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Alike with stubborn clasp he clung,"
1321,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Tenacious of his grasp;
1322,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"For well he knew with what a power,"
1323,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Exempt from Nature's laws,"
1324,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The Curse had arm'd him for this hour;
1325,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And in the monster's gasping jaws,"
1326,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And in his hollow eye,"
1327,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Well could Ladurlad now descry
1328,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The certain signs of victory.
1329,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1330,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,17.
1331,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And now the guard no more can keep
1332,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His painful watch; his eyes, opprest,"
1333,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Are fainting for their natural sleep;
1334,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{53}
1335,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"His living flesh and blood must rest,"
1336,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The Beast must sleep or die.
1337,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Then he, full faint and languidly,"
1338,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Unwreathes his rings and strives to fly,"
1339,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And still retreating, slowly trails"
1340,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,His stiff and heavy length of scales.
1341,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"But that unweariable foe,"
1342,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"With will relentless, follows still;"
1343,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"No breathing time, no pause of fight"
1344,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"He gives, but presses on his flight;"
1345,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Along the vaulted chambers, and the ascent"
1346,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Up to the emerald-tinted light of day,"
1347,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"He harasses his way,"
1348,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Till lifeless, underneath his grasp,"
1349,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The huge Sea-Monster lay.
1350,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1351,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,18.
1352,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"That obstinate work is done! Ladurlad cried,"
1353,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,One labour yet remains!
1354,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,And thoughtfully he eyed
1355,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Ereenia's ponderous chains;
1356,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"And with vain effort, half-despairing, tried"
1357,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The rivets deep in-driven. Instinctively,"
1358,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"As if in search of aid, he look'd around:"
1359,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,{54}
1360,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Oh, then, how gladly, in the near alcove,"
1361,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Fallen on the ground its lifeless Lord beside,"
1362,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"The crescent scymitar he spied,"
1363,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Whose cloudy blade, with potent spells imbued,"
1364,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Had lain so many an age unhurt in solitude.
1365,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,
1366,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,19.
1367,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Joyfully springing there
1368,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"He seiz'd the weapon, and with eager stroke"
1369,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Hew'd at the chain; the force was dealt in vain,"
1370,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,For not as if through yielding air
1371,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Past the descending scymitar,"
1372,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Its deaden'd way the heavy water broke;
1373,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Yet it bit deep. Again, with both his hands,"
1374,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"He wields the blade, and dealt a surer blow."
1375,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,The baser metal yields
1376,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"To that fine edge, and lo! the Glendoveer"
1377,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,"Rises and snaps the half-sever'd links, and stands"
1378,THE ANCIENT SEPULCHRES.,Freed from his broken bands.

1385,BALY.,
1386,BALY.,1.
1387,BALY.,"This is the appointed night,"
1388,BALY.,"The night of joy and consecrated mirth,"
1389,BALY.,"When, from his judgement-seat in Padalon,"
1390,BALY.,"By Yamen's throne,"
1391,BALY.,"Baly goes forth, that he may walk the Earth"
1392,BALY.,"Unseen, and hear his name"
1393,BALY.,Still hymn'd and honour'd by the grateful voice
1394,BALY.,"Of humankind, and in his fame rejoice."
1395,BALY.,"Therefore from door to door, and street to street,"
1396,BALY.,"With willing feet,"
1397,BALY.,"Shaking their firebrands, the glad children run;"
1398,BALY.,{56}
1399,BALY.,"Baly! great Baly! they acclaim,"
1400,BALY.,Where'er they run they bear the mighty name;
1401,BALY.,"Where'er they meet,"
1402,BALY.,Baly! great Baly! still their choral tongues repeat.
1403,BALY.,Therefore at every door the votive flame
1404,BALY.,"Through pendant lanthorns sheds its painted light,"
1405,BALY.,"And rockets hissing upward through the sky,"
1406,BALY.,Fall like a shower of stars
1407,BALY.,From Heaven's black canopy.
1408,BALY.,"Therefore, on yonder mountain's templed height,"
1409,BALY.,The brazen cauldron blazes through the night.
1410,BALY.,Huge as a Ship that travels the main sea
1411,BALY.,Is that capacious brass; its wick as tall
1412,BALY.,As is the mast of some great admiral.
1413,BALY.,Ten thousand votaries bring
1414,BALY.,Camphor and ghee to feed the sacred flame;
1415,BALY.,"And while, through regions round, the nations see"
1416,BALY.,"Its fiery pillar curling high in heaven,"
1417,BALY.,"Baly! great Baly! they exclaim,"
1418,BALY.,For ever hallowed be his blessed name!
1419,BALY.,Honour and praise to him for ever more be given!
1420,BALY.,
1421,BALY.,2.
1422,BALY.,"Why art not thou among the festive throng,"
1423,BALY.,{57}
1424,BALY.,"Baly, O Mighty One! to hear thy fame?"
1425,BALY.,"Still as of yore, with pageantry and song"
1426,BALY.,"The glowing streets along,"
1427,BALY.,They celebrate thy name;
1428,BALY.,Baly! great Baly! still
1429,BALY.,"The grateful habitants of Earth acclaim,"
1430,BALY.,Baly! great Baly! still
1431,BALY.,The ringing walls and echoing towers proclaim.
1432,BALY.,From yonder mountain the portentous flame
1433,BALY.,Still blazes to the nations as before;
1434,BALY.,"All things appear to human eyes the same,"
1435,BALY.,As perfect as of yore;
1436,BALY.,"To human eyes, . . but how unlike to thine!"
1437,BALY.,Thine which were wont to see
1438,BALY.,"The Company divine,"
1439,BALY.,That with their presence came to honour thee!
1440,BALY.,For all the blessed ones of mortal birth
1441,BALY.,"Who have been cloth'd with immortality,"
1442,BALY.,"From the eight corners of the Earth,"
1443,BALY.,"From the Seven Worlds assembling, all"
1444,BALY.,Wont to attend thy solemn festival.
1445,BALY.,Then did thine eyes behold
1446,BALY.,"The wide air peopled with that glorious train,"
1447,BALY.,"Now may'st thou seek the blessed ones in vain,"
1448,BALY.,{58}
1449,BALY.,For Earth and Air are now beneath the Rajah's reign.
1450,BALY.,
1451,BALY.,3.
1452,BALY.,Therefore the Mighty One hath walk'd the Earth
1453,BALY.,In sorrow and in solitude to-night.
1454,BALY.,The sound of human mirth
1455,BALY.,To him is no delight;
1456,BALY.,"He turns away from that ungrateful sight,"
1457,BALY.,"Hallowed not now by visitants divine,"
1458,BALY.,And there he bends his melancholy way
1459,BALY.,"Where, in yon full-orb'd Moon's refulgent light,"
1460,BALY.,The Golden Towers of his old City shine
1461,BALY.,Above the silver sea. The mighty Chief
1462,BALY.,"There bent his way in grief,"
1463,BALY.,As if sad thoughts indulged would work their own relief.
1464,BALY.,
1465,BALY.,4.
1466,BALY.,There he beholds upon the sand
1467,BALY.,A lovely Maiden in the moonlight stand.
1468,BALY.,"The land-breeze lifts her locks of jet,"
1469,BALY.,"The waves around her polish'd ancles play,"
1470,BALY.,Her bosom with the salt sea-spray is wet;
1471,BALY.,"Her arms are crost, unconsciously, to fold"
1472,BALY.,"That bosom from the cold,"
1473,BALY.,{59}
1474,BALY.,"While statue-like she seems her watch to keep,"
1475,BALY.,Gazing intently on the restless deep.
1476,BALY.,
1477,BALY.,5.
1478,BALY.,"Seven miserable days had Kailyal there,"
1479,BALY.,"From earliest dawn till evening, watch'd the deep;"
1480,BALY.,"Six nights within the chamber of the rock,"
1481,BALY.,"Had laid her down, and found in prayer"
1482,BALY.,That comfort which she sought in vain from sleep.
1483,BALY.,"But when the seventh night came,"
1484,BALY.,"Never should she behold her Father more,"
1485,BALY.,The wretched Maiden said in her despair;
1486,BALY.,"Yet would not quit the shore,"
1487,BALY.,Nor turn her eyes one moment from the sea:
1488,BALY.,Never before
1489,BALY.,"Had Kailyal watch'd it so impatiently,"
1490,BALY.,"Never so eagerly had hop'd before,"
1491,BALY.,"As now when she believ'd, and said, all hope was o'er."
1492,BALY.,
1493,BALY.,6.
1494,BALY.,"Beholding her, how beautiful she stood,"
1495,BALY.,"In that wild solitude,"
1496,BALY.,Baly from his invisibility
1497,BALY.,"Had issued then, to know her cause of woe;"
1498,BALY.,{60}
1499,BALY.,"But that, in the air beside her, he espied"
1500,BALY.,"Two Powers of Evil for her hurt allied,"
1501,BALY.,Foul Arvalan and dreadful Lorrinite.
1502,BALY.,"The Mighty One they could not see,"
1503,BALY.,And marking with what demon-like delight
1504,BALY.,"They kept their innocent prey in sight,"
1505,BALY.,"He waits, expecting what the end may be."
1506,BALY.,
1507,BALY.,7.
1508,BALY.,"She starts; for lo! where floating many a rood,"
1509,BALY.,"A Monster, hugest of the Ocean brood,"
1510,BALY.,"Weltering and lifeless, drifts toward the shore."
1511,BALY.,"Backward she starts in fear before the flood,"
1512,BALY.,"And, when the waves retreat,"
1513,BALY.,They leave their hideous burthen at her feet.
1514,BALY.,
1515,BALY.,8.
1516,BALY.,"She ventures to approach with timid tread,"
1517,BALY.,"She starts, and half draws back in fear,"
1518,BALY.,"Then stops, and stretches on her head,"
1519,BALY.,To see if that huge beast indeed be dead.
1520,BALY.,"Now growing bold, the Maid advances near,"
1521,BALY.,Even to the margin of the ocean-flood.
1522,BALY.,"Rightly she reads her Father's victory,"
1523,BALY.,{61}
1524,BALY.,"And lifts her joyous hands, exultingly,"
1525,BALY.,To Heaven in gratitude.
1526,BALY.,"Then spreading them toward the Sea,"
1527,BALY.,"While pious tears bedim her streaming eyes,"
1528,BALY.,"Come! come! my Father, come to me!"
1529,BALY.,"Ereenia, come! she cries."
1530,BALY.,"Lo! from the opening deep they rise,"
1531,BALY.,And to Ladurlad's arms the happy Kailyal flies.
1532,BALY.,
1533,BALY.,9.
1534,BALY.,"She turn'd from him, to meet, with beating heart,"
1535,BALY.,The Glendoveer's embrace.
1536,BALY.,"Now turn to me, for mine thou art!"
1537,BALY.,Foul Arvalan exdaim'd; his loathsome face
1538,BALY.,"Came forth, and from the air,"
1539,BALY.,"In fleshly form, he burst."
1540,BALY.,"Always in horror and despair,"
1541,BALY.,"Had Kailyal seen that form and face accurst,"
1542,BALY.,But yet so sharp a pang had ne'er
1543,BALY.,"Shot with a thrill like death through all her frame,"
1544,BALY.,As now when on her hour of joy the Spectre came.
1545,BALY.,
1546,BALY.,10.
1547,BALY.,"Vain is resistance now,"
1548,BALY.,{62}
1549,BALY.,The fiendish laugh of Lorrinite is heard;
1550,BALY.,"And, at her dreadful word,"
1551,BALY.,"The Asuras once again appear,"
1552,BALY.,And seize Ladurlad and the Glendoveer.
1553,BALY.,
1554,BALY.,11.
1555,BALY.,Hold your accursed hands!
1556,BALY.,"A Voice exclaim'd, whose dread commands"
1557,BALY.,Were fear'd through all the vaults of Padalon;
1558,BALY.,"And there among them, in the midnight air,"
1559,BALY.,The presence of the mighty Baly shone.
1560,BALY.,"He, making manifest his mightiness,"
1561,BALY.,"Put forth on every side an hundred arms,"
1562,BALY.,"And seiz'd the Sorceress; maugre all her charms,"
1563,BALY.,Her and her fiendish ministers he caught
1564,BALY.,With force as uncontroulable as fate;
1565,BALY.,"And that unhappy Soul, to whom"
1566,BALY.,The Almighty Rajah's power availeth not
1567,BALY.,"Living to avert, nor dead to mitigate"
1568,BALY.,His righteous doom.

1574,BALY.,That mightier Power; with irresistible feet
1575,BALY.,"He stampt and cleft the Earth; it opened wide,"
1576,BALY.,And gave him way to his own judgement-seat.
1577,BALY.,"Down, like a plummet, to the World below"

1589,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Clos'd o'er his way as to the judgement-seat
1590,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,He plunged and bore his prey.
1591,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Scarce had the shock subsided,"
1592,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"When, darting from the Swerga's heavenly heights,"
1593,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Kehama, like a thunderbolt, alights."
1594,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"In wrath he came, a bickering flame"
1595,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Flash'd from his eyes which made the moonlight dim,"
1596,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"And passion forcing way from every limb,"
1597,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Like furnace-smoke, with terrors wrapt him round."
1598,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Furious he smote the ground;
1599,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,{65}
1600,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Earth trembled underneath the dreadful stroke,"
1601,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Again in sunder riven;
1602,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,He hurl'd in rage his whirling weapon down.
1603,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,But lo! the fiery sheckra to his feet
1604,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Return'd, as if by equal force re-driven,"
1605,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,And from the abyss the voice of Baly came:
1606,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Not yet, O Rajah, hast thou won"
1607,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,The realms of Padalon!
1608,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Earth and the Swerga are thine own,"
1609,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"But, till Kehama shall subdue the throne"
1610,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Of Hell, in torments Yamen holds his son."

1613,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Fool that he is! . . in torments let him lie!
1614,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Kehama, wrathful at his son, replied."
1615,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,But what am I
1616,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,That thou should'st brave me? . . kindling in his pride
1617,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,The dreadful Rajah cried.
1618,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Ho! Yamen! hear me. God of Padalon,"
1619,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Prepare thy throne,"
1620,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,And let the Amreeta cup
1621,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Be ready for my lips, when I anon"

1631,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,And eyes that darted their red anger down.
1632,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Then drawing back he let the earth subside,"
1633,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"And, as his wrath relax'd, survey'd,"
1634,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Thoughtful and silently, the mortal Maid."
1635,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Her eye the while was on the farthest sky,"
1636,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Where up the etherial height
1637,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Ereenia rose and past away from sight.
1638,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Never had she so joyfully
1639,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Beheld the coming of the Glendoveer,"
1640,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Dear as he was and he deserv'd to be,"

1648,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Had laid his terrors by
1649,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,And gaz'd upon the Maid.
1650,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Pride could not quit his eye,"
1651,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,{67}
1652,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Nor that remorseless nature from his front

1654,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Had felt some admiration mix'd with dread,"
1655,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,And might have said
1656,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,That sure he seem'd to be the King of Men;
1657,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Less than the greatest that he could not be,"
1658,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Who carried in his port such might and majesty.

1660,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,5.
1661,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"In fear no longer for the Glendoveer,"
1662,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Now toward the Rajah Kailyal turn'd her eyes
1663,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,As if to ask what doom awaited her.
1664,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"But then surprise,"
1665,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Even as with fascination, held them there,"
1666,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,So strange a thing it seem'd to see the change
1667,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Of purport in that all-commanding brow,"
1668,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,That thoughtfully was bent upon her now.
1669,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Wondering she gaz'd, the while her Father's eye"
1670,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Was fix'd upon Kehama haughtily;
1671,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"It spake defiance to him, high disdain,"
1672,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Stern patience, unsubduable by pain,"
1673,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,And pride triumphant over agony.
1674,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,
1675,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,6.
1676,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Ladurlad, said the Rajah, thou and I"
1677,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,{68}
1678,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Alike have done the work of Destiny,"
1679,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Unknowing each to what the impulse tended;
1680,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,But now that over Earth and Heaven my reign
1681,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Is stablish'd, and the ways of Fate are plain"
1682,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Before me, here our enmity is ended."
1683,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"I take away thy Curse. . . As thus he said,"
1684,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,The fire which in Ladurlad's heart and brain
1685,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Was burning, fled, and left him free from pain."
1686,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"So rapidly his torments were departed,"
1687,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"That at the sudden ease he started,"
1688,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"As with a shock, and to his head"
1689,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"His hands up-fled,"
1690,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,As if he felt through every failing limb
1691,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,The power and sense of life forsaking him.
1692,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,
1693,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,7.
1694,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Then turning to the Maid, the Rajah cried,"
1695,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"O Virgin, above all of mortal birth"
1696,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Favour'd alike in beauty and in worth,"
1697,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"And in the glories of thy destiny,"
1698,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Now let thy happy heart exult with pride,"
1699,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,For Fate hath chosen thee
1700,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"To be Kehama's bride,"
1701,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"To be the Queen of Heaven and Earth,"
1702,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,And of whatever Worlds beside
1703,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,{69}
1704,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Infinity may hide . . . For I can see
1705,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"The writing which, at thy nativity,"
1706,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"All-knowing Nature wrought upon thy brain,"
1707,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"In branching veins, which to the gifted eye"
1708,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Map out the mazes of futurity.
1709,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"There is it written, Maid, that thou and I,"
1710,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Alone of human kind a deathless pair,"
1711,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Are doom'd to share
1712,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,The Amreeta-drink divine
1713,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Of immortality. Come, Maiden mine!"
1714,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"High-fated One, ascend the subject sky,"
1715,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,And by Kehama's side
1716,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Sit on the Swerga throne, his equal bride."
1717,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,
1718,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,8.
1719,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Oh never, . . never . . Father! Kailyal cried;"
1720,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"It is not as he saith, . . it cannot be!"
1721,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"I! . . I, his bride!"
1722,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Nature is never false; he wrongeth her!
1723,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,My heart belies such lines of destiny.
1724,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,There is no other true interpreter!
1725,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,
1726,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,9.
1727,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,At that reply Kehama's darkening brow
1728,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,{70}
1729,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Bewray'd the anger which he yet supprest.
1730,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Counsel thy daughter; tell her thou art now
1731,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Free from thy Curse, he said, and bid her bow"
1732,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,In thankfulness to Fate's benign behest.
1733,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Bid her her stubborn will restrain,"
1734,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"For Destiny at last must be obey'd,"
1735,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"And tell her, while obedience is delay'd,"
1736,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Thy Curse will burn again.

1741,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Of Destiny! for though all other things
1742,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Were subject to the starry influencings,"
1743,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"And bow'd submissive to thy tyranny,"
1744,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"The virtuous heart, and resolute will are free."
1745,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,Thus in their wisdom did the Gods decree
1746,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"When they created man. Let come what will,"
1747,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"This is our rock of strength; in every ill,"
1748,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"Sorrow, oppression, pain and agony,"
1749,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"The spirit of the good is unsubdued,"

1758,KEHAMA'S DESCENT.,"So saying, his vindictive hand he flung"

1935,MOUNT CALASAY.,Where is the Sage whose wisdom can declare
1936,MOUNT CALASAY.,"The hidden things of that mysterious flower,"

1938,MOUNT CALASAY.,"The sacred triangle is there,"

1943,MOUNT CALASAY.,Here first the Glendoveer

1945,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Was it that fear came over him, when here"
1946,MOUNT CALASAY.,He saw the imagin'd throne appear?
1947,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Not so, for his immortal sight"
1948,MOUNT CALASAY.,Endur'd the Table's light;
1949,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Distinctly he beheld all things around,"
1950,MOUNT CALASAY.,And doubt and wonder rose within his mind
1951,MOUNT CALASAY.,That this was all he found.
1952,MOUNT CALASAY.,Howbeit he lifted up his voice and spake.
1953,MOUNT CALASAY.,There is oppression in the World below;
1954,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Earth groans beneath the yoke; yea, in her woe,"
1955,MOUNT CALASAY.,She asks if the Avenger's eye is blind?

1963,MOUNT CALASAY.,"So as he pray'd, intenser faith he felt,"
1964,MOUNT CALASAY.,His spirit seem'd to melt
1965,MOUNT CALASAY.,With ardent yearnings of increasing love;
1966,MOUNT CALASAY.,Upward he turn'd his eyes
1967,MOUNT CALASAY.,As if there should be something yet above;
1968,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Let me not, Seeva! seek in vain! he cries,"
1969,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Thou art not here, . . for how should these contain thee?"
1970,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Thou art not here, . . for how should I sustain thee?"
1971,MOUNT CALASAY.,"But thou, where'er thou art,"
1972,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Canst hear the voice of prayer,"

1992,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Abash'd, confounded,"
1993,MOUNT CALASAY.,It left the Glendoveer; . . yea all astounded
1994,MOUNT CALASAY.,In overpowering fear and deep dismay;
1995,MOUNT CALASAY.,"For when that Bell had sounded,"
1996,MOUNT CALASAY.,"The Rose, with all the mysteries it surrounded,"
1997,MOUNT CALASAY.,"The Bell, the Table, and Mount Calasay,"

2015,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Down fell the Glendoveer,"

2018,MOUNT CALASAY.,"A voice, which from within him came, was heard,"
2019,MOUNT CALASAY.,The indubitable word
2020,MOUNT CALASAY.,Of Him to whom all secret things are known:
2021,MOUNT CALASAY.,"Go, ye who suffer, go to Yamen's throne."

2048,THE EMBARKATION.,"She met him now, and, turning half aside,"

2050,THE EMBARKATION.,"Strange things, Ereenia, have befallen us here,"
2051,THE EMBARKATION.,The Virgin said; the Almighty Man hath read

2063,THE EMBARKATION.,"Thou seest his poor revenge! So having said,"

2131,THE EMBARKATION.,"Strange vessel sure it seem'd to be,"
2132,THE EMBARKATION.,And all unfit for such wild sea!
2133,THE EMBARKATION.,For through its yawning side the wave
2134,THE EMBARKATION.,"Was oozing in; the mast was frail,"
2135,THE EMBARKATION.,And old and torn its only sail.
2136,THE EMBARKATION.,How shall that crazy vessel brave

2150,THE EMBARKATION.,Aboard! aboard!
2151,THE EMBARKATION.,"An awful voice, that left no choice,"

2267,THE WORLD'S END.,Yon blue serene above

2675,PADALON.,Dimly reflected on the watry walls;
2676,PADALON.,"How heavenly seems the sky,"
2677,PADALON.,"And how, with quicken'd feet, he hastens up,"
2678,PADALON.,Eager again to greet
2679,PADALON.,"The living World, and blessed sunshine there,"
2680,PADALON.,"And drink, as from a cup"
2681,PADALON.,"Of joy, with thirsty lips, the open air."
2682,PADALON.,
2683,PADALON.,2.
2684,PADALON.,Far other light than that of day there shone
2685,PADALON.,"Upon the travellers, entering Padalon."
2686,PADALON.,"They, too, in darkness entered on their way,"
2687,PADALON.,"But, far before the Car,"
2688,PADALON.,"A glow, as of a fiery furnace light,"
2689,PADALON.,Fill'd all before them. 'Twas a light which made
2690,PADALON.,Darkness itself appear
2691,PADALON.,"A thing of comfort, and the sight, dismay'd,"
2692,PADALON.,Shrunk inward from the molten atmosphere.
2693,PADALON.,Their way was through the adamantine rock
2694,PADALON.,Which girt the World of Woe; on either side
2695,PADALON.,"Its massive walls arose, and overhead"
2696,PADALON.,{111}
2697,PADALON.,"Arch'd the long passage; onward as they ride,"
2698,PADALON.,"With stronger glare the light around them spread,"
2699,PADALON.,"And lo! the regions dread,"
2700,PADALON.,"The World of Woe before them, opening wide."
2701,PADALON.,
2702,PADALON.,3.
2703,PADALON.,"There rolls the fiery flood,"
2704,PADALON.,Girding the realms of Padalon around.
2705,PADALON.,"A sea of flame it seem'd to be,"
2706,PADALON.,Sea without bound;
2707,PADALON.,"For neither mortal, nor immortal sight,"
2708,PADALON.,Could pierce across through that intensest light.
2709,PADALON.,"A single rib of steel,"
2710,PADALON.,"Keen as the edge of keenest scymitar,"
2711,PADALON.,Spann'd this wide gulph of fire. The infernal Car
2712,PADALON.,"Roll'd to the Gulph, and on its single wheel"
2713,PADALON.,Self-balanced; rose upon that edge of steel.
2714,PADALON.,Red-quivering float the vapours overhead;
2715,PADALON.,"The fiery gulph beneath them spread,"
2716,PADALON.,Tosses its billowing blaze with rush and roar;
2717,PADALON.,"Steady and swift the self-mov'd Chariot went,"
2718,PADALON.,"Winning the long ascent,"
2719,PADALON.,"Then, downward rolling, gains the farther shore."
2720,PADALON.,
2721,PADALON.,{112}
2722,PADALON.,
2723,PADALON.,4.
2724,PADALON.,"But, oh! what sounds and sights of woe,"
2725,PADALON.,"What sights and sounds of fear,"
2726,PADALON.,Assail the mortal travellers here!
2727,PADALON.,"Their way was on a causey straight and wide,"
2728,PADALON.,"Where penal vaults on either side were seen,"
2729,PADALON.,Ranged like the cells wherein
2730,PADALON.,Those wonderous winged alchemists infold
2731,PADALON.,Their stores of liquid gold.
2732,PADALON.,Thick walls of adamant divide
2733,PADALON.,"The dungeons; and from yonder circling flood,"
2734,PADALON.,"Off-streams of fire through secret channels glide,"
2735,PADALON.,"And wind among them, and in each provide"
2736,PADALON.,An everlasting food
2737,PADALON.,Of righteous torments for the accursed brood.
2738,PADALON.,
2739,PADALON.,5.
2740,PADALON.,"These were the rebel race, who, in their might"
2741,PADALON.,"Confiding impiously, would fain have driven"
2742,PADALON.,The Deities supreme from highest Heaven;
2743,PADALON.,"But by the Suras, in celestial fight,"
2744,PADALON.,"Oppos'd and put to flight,"
2745,PADALON.,"Here, in their penal dens, the accursed crew,"
2746,PADALON.,{113}
2747,PADALON.,"Not for its crime, but for its failure, rue"
2748,PADALON.,Their wild ambition. Yet again they long
2749,PADALON.,"The contest to renew,"
2750,PADALON.,And wield their arms again in happier hour;
2751,PADALON.,"And with united power,"
2752,PADALON.,"Following Kehama's triumph, to press on"
2753,PADALON.,"From World to World, and Heaven to Heaven, and Sphere"
2754,PADALON.,"To Sphere, till Hemakoot shall be their own,"
2755,PADALON.,"And Meru Mount, and Indra's Swerga-Bowers,"
2756,PADALON.,"And Brama's region, where the heavenly Hours"
2757,PADALON.,Weave the vast circle of his age-long day.
2758,PADALON.,Even over Veeshnoo's empyreal seat
2759,PADALON.,"They trust the Rajah shall extend their sway,"
2760,PADALON.,"And that the seven-headed Snake, whereon"
2761,PADALON.,"The strong Preserver sets his conquering feet,"
2762,PADALON.,"Will rise and shake him headlong from his throne,"
2763,PADALON.,"When, in their irresistible array,"
2764,PADALON.,Amid the Milky Sea they force their way.
2765,PADALON.,Even higher yet their frantic thoughts aspire;
2766,PADALON.,"Yea, on their beds of torment as they lie,"
2767,PADALON.,"The highest, holiest Seeva, they defy,"
2768,PADALON.,"And tell him they shall have anon their day,"
2769,PADALON.,"When they will storm his realm, and seize Mount Calasay."
2770,PADALON.,
2771,PADALON.,{114}
2772,PADALON.,
2773,PADALON.,6.
2774,PADALON.,Such impious hopes torment
2775,PADALON.,"Their raging hearts, impious and impotent;"
2776,PADALON.,"And now, with unendurable desire"
2777,PADALON.,"And lust of vengeance, that, like inward fire,"
2778,PADALON.,"Doth aggravate their punishment, they rave"
2779,PADALON.,Upon Kehama; him the accursed rout
2780,PADALON.,Acclaim; with furious cries and maddening shout
2781,PADALON.,They call on him to save;
2782,PADALON.,Kehama! they exclaim;
2783,PADALON.,"Thundering, the dreadful echo rolls about,"
2784,PADALON.,And Hell's whole vault repeats Kehama's name.
2785,PADALON.,
2786,PADALON.,7.
2787,PADALON.,"Over these dens of punishment, the host"
2788,PADALON.,"Of Padalon maintain eternal guard,"
2789,PADALON.,Keeping upon the walls their vigilant ward.
2790,PADALON.,At every angle stood
2791,PADALON.,"A watch-tower, the decurion Demon's post,"
2792,PADALON.,"Where, rais'd on high, he view'd with sleepless eye"
2793,PADALON.,"His trust, that all was well. And over these,"
2794,PADALON.,"Such was the perfect discipline of Hell,"
2795,PADALON.,Captains of fifties and of hundreds held
2796,PADALON.,"Authority, each in his loftier tower;"
2797,PADALON.,{115}
2798,PADALON.,And chiefs of legions over them had power;
2799,PADALON.,And thus all Hell with towers was girt around.
2800,PADALON.,Aloft the brazen turrets shone
2801,PADALON.,"In the red light of Padalon,"
2802,PADALON.,"And on the walls between,"
2803,PADALON.,"Dark moving, the infernal Guards were seen,"
2804,PADALON.,Gigantic Demons pacing to and fro;
2805,PADALON.,"Who ever and anon,"
2806,PADALON.,"Spreading their crimson pennons, plunged below,"
2807,PADALON.,Faster to rivet down the Asuras' chains;
2808,PADALON.,"And with the snaky scourge and fiercer pains,"
2809,PADALON.,"Repress their rage rebellious. Loud around,"
2810,PADALON.,"In mingled sound, the echoing lash, the clash"
2811,PADALON.,"Of chains, the ponderous hammer's iron stroke,"
2812,PADALON.,"With execrations, groans, and shrieks and cries"
2813,PADALON.,"Combin'd, in one wild dissonance, arise;"
2814,PADALON.,"And through the din there broke,"
2815,PADALON.,"Like thunder heard through all the warring winds,"
2816,PADALON.,"The dreadful name. Kehama, still they rave,"
2817,PADALON.,Hasten and save!
2818,PADALON.,"Now, now, Deliverer! now, Kehama, now!"
2819,PADALON.,"Earthly Almighty, wherefore tarriest thou!"
2820,PADALON.,
2821,PADALON.,8.
2822,PADALON.,"Oh, if that name abhorr'd,"
2823,PADALON.,{116}
2824,PADALON.,"Thus utter'd, could well nigh"
2825,PADALON.,"Dismay the Powers of Hell, and daunt their Lord,"
2826,PADALON.,How fearfully to Kailyal's ear it came!
2827,PADALON.,"She, as the Car roll'd on its rapid way,"
2828,PADALON.,"Bent down her head, and clos'd her eyes for dread;"
2829,PADALON.,"And deafening, with strong effort from within,"
2830,PADALON.,"Her ears against the din,"
2831,PADALON.,Cover'd and prest them close with both her hands.
2832,PADALON.,Sure if the mortal Maiden had not fed
2833,PADALON.,"On heavenly food, and long been strengthened"
2834,PADALON.,"With heavenly converse for such end vouchsaf'd,"
2835,PADALON.,"Her human heart had fail'd, and she had died"
2836,PADALON.,Beneath the horrors of this awful hour.
2837,PADALON.,But heaven supplied a power
2838,PADALON.,"Beyond her earthly nature, to the measure"
2839,PADALON.,Of need infusing strength;
2840,PADALON.,"And Fate, whose secret and unerring pleasure"
2841,PADALON.,"Appointed all, decreed"
2842,PADALON.,An ample meed and recompence at length.
2843,PADALON.,"High-fated Maid, the righteous hour is nigh!"
2844,PADALON.,The all-embracing Eye
2845,PADALON.,Of Retribution still beholdeth thee;
2846,PADALON.,"Bear onward to the end, O Maid, courageously!"
2847,PADALON.,
2848,PADALON.,{117}
2849,PADALON.,
2850,PADALON.,9.
2851,PADALON.,"On roll'd the Car, and lo! afar"
2852,PADALON.,Upon its height the Towers of Yamenpur
2853,PADALON.,Rise on the astonish'd sight.
2854,PADALON.,"Behold the infernal City, Yamen's seat"
2855,PADALON.,"Of empire, in the midst of Padalon,"
2856,PADALON.,Where the eight causeys meet.
2857,PADALON.,"There on a rock of adamant it stood,"
2858,PADALON.,"Resplendent far and wide,"
2859,PADALON.,"Itself of solid diamond edified,"
2860,PADALON.,And all around it roll'd the fiery flood.
2861,PADALON.,Eight bridges arch'd the stream; huge piles of brass
2862,PADALON.,"Magnificent, such structures as beseem"
2863,PADALON.,"The Seat and Capital of such great God,"
2864,PADALON.,Worthy of Yamen's own august abode.
2865,PADALON.,A brazen tower and gateway at each end
2866,PADALON.,"Of each was rais'd, where Giant Wardens stood,"
2867,PADALON.,"Station'd in arms the passage to defend,"
2868,PADALON.,That never foe might cross the fiery flood.
2869,PADALON.,
2870,PADALON.,10.
2871,PADALON.,Oh what a gorgeous sight it was to see
2872,PADALON.,The Diamond City blazing on its height
2873,PADALON.,"With more than mid-sun splendour, by the light"
2874,PADALON.,{118}
2875,PADALON.,Of its own fiery river!
2876,PADALON.,"Its towers and domes and pinnacles and spires,"
2877,PADALON.,"Turrets and battlements, that flash and quiver"
2878,PADALON.,Through the red restless atmosphere for ever.
2879,PADALON.,"And hovering over head,"
2880,PADALON.,"The smoke and vapours of all Padalon,"
2881,PADALON.,"Fit firmament for such a world, were spread,"
2882,PADALON.,"With surge and swell, and everlasting motion,"
2883,PADALON.,Heaving and opening like tumultuous ocean.
2884,PADALON.,
2885,PADALON.,11.
2886,PADALON.,Nor were there wanting there
2887,PADALON.,Such glories as beseem'd such region well;
2888,PADALON.,For though with our blue heaven and genial air
2889,PADALON.,"The firmament of Hell might not compare,"
2890,PADALON.,As little might our earthly tempests vie
2891,PADALON.,"With the dread storms of that infernal sky,"
2892,PADALON.,Whose clouds of all metallic elements
2893,PADALON.,"Sublim'd were full. For, when its thunder broke,"
2894,PADALON.,"Not all the united World's artillery,"
2895,PADALON.,"In one discharge, could equal that loud stroke;"
2896,PADALON.,And though the Diamond Towers and Battlements
2897,PADALON.,"Stood firm upon their adamantine rock,"
2898,PADALON.,"Yet, while it vollied round the vault of Hell,"
2899,PADALON.,{119}
2900,PADALON.,"Earth's solid arch was shaken with the shock,"
2901,PADALON.,And Cities in one mighty ruin fell.
2902,PADALON.,Through the red sky terrific meteors scour;
2903,PADALON.,"Huge stones come hailing down; or sulphur-shower,"
2904,PADALON.,"Floating amid the lurid air like snow,"
2905,PADALON.,"Kindles in its descent,"
2906,PADALON.,And with blue fire-drops rains on all below.
2907,PADALON.,At times the whole supernal element
2908,PADALON.,"Igniting, burst in one vast sheet of flame,"
2909,PADALON.,And roar'd as with the sound
2910,PADALON.,"Of rushing winds, above, below, around;"
2911,PADALON.,"Anon the flame was spent, and overhead"
2912,PADALON.,A heavy cloud of moving darkness spread.
2913,PADALON.,
2914,PADALON.,12.
2915,PADALON.,Straight to the brazen bridge and gate
2916,PADALON.,The self-mov'd Chariot bears its mortal load.
2917,PADALON.,"At sight of Carmala,"
2918,PADALON.,"On either side the Giant guards divide,"
2919,PADALON.,And give the chariot way.
2920,PADALON.,"Up yonder winding road it rolls along,"
2921,PADALON.,"Swift as the bittern soars on spiral wing,"
2922,PADALON.,And lo! the Palace of the Infernal King!
2923,PADALON.,
2924,PADALON.,{120}
2925,PADALON.,
2926,PADALON.,13.
2927,PADALON.,Two forms inseparable in unity
2928,PADALON.,Hath Yamen; even as with hope or fear
2929,PADALON.,The Soul regardeth him doth he appear;
2930,PADALON.,"For hope and fear,"
2931,PADALON.,"At that dread hour, from ominous conscience spring,"
2932,PADALON.,"And err not in their bodings. Therefore some,"
2933,PADALON.,"They who polluted with offences come,"
2934,PADALON.,Behold him as the King
2935,PADALON.,"Of Terrors, black of aspect, red of eye;"
2936,PADALON.,"Reflecting back upon the sinful mind,"
2937,PADALON.,"Heighten'd with vengeance, and with wrath divine,"
2938,PADALON.,Its own inborn deformity.
2939,PADALON.,But to the righteous Spirit how benign
2940,PADALON.,"His awful countenance,"
2941,PADALON.,"Where, tempering justice with parental love,"
2942,PADALON.,Goodness and heavenly grace
2943,PADALON.,And sweetest mercy shine! Yet is he still
2944,PADALON.,"Himself the same, one form, one face, one will;"
2945,PADALON.,And these his twofold aspects are but one;
2946,PADALON.,And change is none
2947,PADALON.,"In him, for change in Yamen could not be,"
2948,PADALON.,The Immutable is he.
2949,PADALON.,
2950,PADALON.,{121}
2951,PADALON.,
2952,PADALON.,14.
2953,PADALON.,He sate upon a marble sepulchre
2954,PADALON.,"Massive and huge, where, at the Monarch's feet,"
2955,PADALON.,The righteous Baly had his judgement-seat.
2956,PADALON.,A Golden Throne before them vacant stood;
2957,PADALON.,"Three human forms sustain'd its ponderous weight,"
2958,PADALON.,"With lifted hands outspread, and shoulders bow'd"
2959,PADALON.,Bending beneath their load.
2960,PADALON.,A fourth was wanting. They were of the hue
2961,PADALON.,"Of coals of fire; yet were they flesh and blood,"
2962,PADALON.,And living breath they drew;
2963,PADALON.,"And their red eye-balls roll'd with ghastly stare,"
2964,PADALON.,"As thus, for their misdeeds, they stood tormented there."
2965,PADALON.,
2966,PADALON.,15.
2967,PADALON.,"On steps of gold those fiery Statues stood,"
2968,PADALON.,Who bore the Golden Throne. A cloud behind
2969,PADALON.,Immoveable was spread; not all the light
2970,PADALON.,Of all the flames and fires of Padalon
2971,PADALON.,Could pierce its depth of night.
2972,PADALON.,There Azyoruca veil'd her awful form
2973,PADALON.,"In those eternal shadows: there she sate,"
2974,PADALON.,"And as the trembling Souls, who crowd around"
2975,PADALON.,"The Judgement-Seat, received the doom of fate,"
2976,PADALON.,{122}
2977,PADALON.,"Her giant arms, extending from the cloud,"
2978,PADALON.,"Drew them within the darkness. Moving out,"
2979,PADALON.,"To grasp and bear away the innumerous rout,"
2980,PADALON.,For ever and for ever thus were seen
2981,PADALON.,The thousand mighty arms of that dread Queen.
2982,PADALON.,
2983,PADALON.,16.
2984,PADALON.,"Here, issuing from the car, the Glendoveer"
2985,PADALON.,"Did homage to the God, then rais'd his head."
2986,PADALON.,"Suppliants we come, he said,"
2987,PADALON.,"I need not tell thee by what wrongs opprest,"
2988,PADALON.,For nought can pass on earth to thee unknown;
2989,PADALON.,"Sufferers from tyranny we seek for rest,"
2990,PADALON.,And Seeva bade us go to Yamen's throne;
2991,PADALON.,"Here, he hath said, all wrongs shall be redrest."
2992,PADALON.,"Yamen replied, Even now the hour draws near,"
2993,PADALON.,When Fate its hidden ways will manifest.
2994,PADALON.,Not for light purpose would the Wisest send
2995,PADALON.,"His suppliants here, when we, in doubt and fear,"
2996,PADALON.,The awful issue of the hour attend.
2997,PADALON.,Wait ye in patience and in faith the end!

3006,THE AMREETA.,"So spake the King of Padalon, when, lo!"
3007,THE AMREETA.,"The voice of lamentation ceas'd in Hell,"
3008,THE AMREETA.,"And sudden silence all around them fell,"
3009,THE AMREETA.,Silence more wild and terrible
3010,THE AMREETA.,Than all the infernal dissonance before.
3011,THE AMREETA.,"Through that portentous stillness, far away,"
3012,THE AMREETA.,"Unwonted sounds were heard, advancing on,"
3013,THE AMREETA.,And deepening on their way;
3014,THE AMREETA.,For now the inexorable hour
3015,THE AMREETA.,"Was come, and in the fullness of his power,"
3016,THE AMREETA.,{124}
3017,THE AMREETA.,"Now that the dreadful rites had all been done,"
3018,THE AMREETA.,"Kehama from the Swerga hastened down,"
3019,THE AMREETA.,To seize upon the throne of Padalon.
3020,THE AMREETA.,
3021,THE AMREETA.,2.
3022,THE AMREETA.,"He came in all his might and majesty,"
3023,THE AMREETA.,"With all his terrors clad, and all his pride;"
3024,THE AMREETA.,"And, by the attribute of Deity,"
3025,THE AMREETA.,"Which he had won from Heaven, self-multiplied,"
3026,THE AMREETA.,The dreadful One appear'd on every side.
3027,THE AMREETA.,"In the same indivisible point of time,"
3028,THE AMREETA.,"At the eight Gates he stood at once, and beat"
3029,THE AMREETA.,The Warden-Gods of Hell beneath his feet;
3030,THE AMREETA.,"Then, in his brazen Cars of triumph, straight,"
3031,THE AMREETA.,"At the same moment, drove through every gate."
3032,THE AMREETA.,"By Aullays, hugest of created kind,"
3033,THE AMREETA.,"Fiercest, and fleeter than the viewless wind,"
3034,THE AMREETA.,"His Cars were drawn, ten yokes of ten abreast, . ."
3035,THE AMREETA.,What less sufficed for such almighty weight?
3036,THE AMREETA.,Eight bridges from the fiery flood arose
3037,THE AMREETA.,"Growing before his way; and on he goes,"
3038,THE AMREETA.,"And drives the thundering Chariot-wheels along,"
3039,THE AMREETA.,At once o'er all the roads of Padalon.

3046,THE AMREETA.,"Waiting, with breathless hope, the great event."
3047,THE AMREETA.,"All Hell was hush'd in dread,"
3048,THE AMREETA.,Such awe that omnipresent coming spread;
3049,THE AMREETA.,"Nor had its voice been heard, though all its rout"
3050,THE AMREETA.,Innumerable had lifted up one shout;
3051,THE AMREETA.,Nor if the infernal firmament
3052,THE AMREETA.,"Had, in one unimaginable burst,"
3053,THE AMREETA.,"Spent its collected thunders, had the sound"
3054,THE AMREETA.,"Been audible, such louder terrors went"
3055,THE AMREETA.,Before his forms substantial. Round about
3056,THE AMREETA.,"The presence scattered lightnings far and wide,"
3057,THE AMREETA.,"That quench'd on every side,"
3058,THE AMREETA.,"With their intensest blaze, the feebler fire"
3059,THE AMREETA.,"Of Padalon, even as the stars go out,"
3060,THE AMREETA.,"When, with prodigious light,"

3075,THE AMREETA.,"Behind, before him, and on every side,"
3076,THE AMREETA.,"Wielding all weapons in his countless hands,"
3077,THE AMREETA.,Around the Lord of Hell Kehama stands!
3078,THE AMREETA.,"Then, too, the Lord of Hell put forth his might:"
3079,THE AMREETA.,"Thick darkness, blacker than the blackest night,"
3080,THE AMREETA.,"Rose from their wrath, and veil'd"
3081,THE AMREETA.,The unutterable fight.
3082,THE AMREETA.,"The power of Fate and Sacrifice prevail'd,"
3083,THE AMREETA.,And soon the strife was done.
3084,THE AMREETA.,Then did the Man-God re-assume
3085,THE AMREETA.,"His unity, absorbing into one"
3086,THE AMREETA.,The consubstantiate shapes; and as the gloom
3087,THE AMREETA.,"Opened, fallen Yamen on the ground was seen,"
3088,THE AMREETA.,"His neck beneath the conquering Rajah's feet,"
3089,THE AMREETA.,Who on the marble tomb

3097,THE AMREETA.,"Dallying with power, he paus'd from following up"
3098,THE AMREETA.,"His conquest, as a man in social hour"
3099,THE AMREETA.,"Sips of the grateful cup,"
3100,THE AMREETA.,"Again and yet again, with curious taste,"
3101,THE AMREETA.,Searching its subtle flavour ere he drink.
3102,THE AMREETA.,Even so Kehama now forbore his haste;
3103,THE AMREETA.,"Having within his reach whate'er he sought,"
3104,THE AMREETA.,"On his own haughty power he seem'd to muse,"
3105,THE AMREETA.,Pampering his arrogant heart with silent thought.
3106,THE AMREETA.,"Before him stood the Golden Throne in sight,"
3107,THE AMREETA.,"Right opposite; he could not chuse but see,"
3108,THE AMREETA.,Nor seeing chuse but wonder. Who are ye
3109,THE AMREETA.,"Who bear the Golden Throne, tormented there?"
3110,THE AMREETA.,He cried; for whom doth Destiny prepare
3111,THE AMREETA.,The imperial seat? and why are ye but Three?
3112,THE AMREETA.,

3114,FIRST STATUE.,"I of the Children of Mankind was first,"
3115,FIRST STATUE.,"Me miserable! who, adding store to store,"

3136,THIRD STATUE.,"Such countless ages, that they seem to be"
3137,THIRD STATUE.,"Long as eternity,"
3138,THIRD STATUE.,And still we are but Three.
3139,THIRD STATUE.,A Fourth will come to share
3140,THIRD STATUE.,"Our pain, at yonder vacant corner bear"
3141,THIRD STATUE.,"His portion of the burthen, and compleat"
3142,THIRD STATUE.,The golden Throne for Yamen's judgement-seat.

3152,THIRD STATUE.,"Kehama, come! we wait for thee too long."
3153,THIRD STATUE.,
3154,THIRD STATUE.,8.
3155,THIRD STATUE.,A short and sudden laugh of wondering pride
3156,THIRD STATUE.,Burst from him in his triumph: to reply
3157,THIRD STATUE.,"Scornful he deign'd not; but with alter'd eye,"
3158,THIRD STATUE.,"Wherein some doubtful meaning seem'd to lie,"
3159,THIRD STATUE.,"He turn'd to Kailyal. Maiden, thus he cried,"
3160,THIRD STATUE.,I need not bid thee see
3161,THIRD STATUE.,"How vain it is to strive with Fate's decree,"
3162,THIRD STATUE.,"When hither thou hast fled to fly from me,"
3163,THIRD STATUE.,And lo! even here thou find'st me at thy side.
3164,THIRD STATUE.,"Mine thou must be, being doom'd with me to share"
3165,THIRD STATUE.,The Amreeta-cup of immortality;
3166,THIRD STATUE.,"Yea, by Myself I swear"
3167,THIRD STATUE.,It hath been thus appointed. Joyfully
3168,THIRD STATUE.,"Join then thy hand and heart and will with mine,"
3169,THIRD STATUE.,{130}
3170,THIRD STATUE.,"Nor at such glorious destiny repine,"
3171,THIRD STATUE.,Nor in thy folly more provoke my wrath divine.
3172,THIRD STATUE.,
3173,THIRD STATUE.,9.
3174,THIRD STATUE.,She answer'd; I have said. It must not be!
3175,THIRD STATUE.,"Almighty as thou art,"
3176,THIRD STATUE.,"Thou hast put all things underneath thy feet,"
3177,THIRD STATUE.,But still the resolute heart
3178,THIRD STATUE.,And virtuous will are free.
3179,THIRD STATUE.,"Never, oh! never, . . never . . can there be"
3180,THIRD STATUE.,"Communion, Rajah, between thee and me."
3181,THIRD STATUE.,
3182,THIRD STATUE.,10.
3183,THIRD STATUE.,"Once more, quoth he, I urge, and once alone."
3184,THIRD STATUE.,"Thou seest yon Golden Throne,"
3185,THIRD STATUE.,Where I anon shall set thee by my side;
3186,THIRD STATUE.,"Take thou thy seat thereon,"
3187,THIRD STATUE.,"Kehama's willing bride,"
3188,THIRD STATUE.,And I will place the Kingdoms of the World
3189,THIRD STATUE.,"Beneath thy Father's feet,"
3190,THIRD STATUE.,Appointing him the King of mortal men:
3191,THIRD STATUE.,"Else underneath that Throne,"
3192,THIRD STATUE.,"The Fourth supporter, he shall stand and groan;"
3193,THIRD STATUE.,Prayers will be vain to move my mercy then.

3198,THIRD STATUE.,"Again the Virgin answer'd, I have said!"
3199,THIRD STATUE.,"Ladurlad caught her in his proud embrace,"
3200,THIRD STATUE.,While on his neck she hid
3201,THIRD STATUE.,In agony her face.
3202,THIRD STATUE.,
3203,THIRD STATUE.,12.
3204,THIRD STATUE.,Bring forth the Amreeta-cup! Kehama cried
3205,THIRD STATUE.,"To Yamen, rising sternly in his pride."
3206,THIRD STATUE.,"It is within the Marble Sepulchre,"
3207,THIRD STATUE.,"The vanquish'd Lord of Padalon replied,"
3208,THIRD STATUE.,Bid it be opened. . . . Give thy treasure up!
3209,THIRD STATUE.,Exclaim'd the Man-Almighty to the Tomb.
3210,THIRD STATUE.,And at his voice and look
3211,THIRD STATUE.,"The massy fabric shook, and opened wide."
3212,THIRD STATUE.,A huge Anatomy was seen reclin'd
3213,THIRD STATUE.,Within its marble womb. Give me the Cup!
3214,THIRD STATUE.,Again Kehama cried; no other charm
3215,THIRD STATUE.,Was needed than that voice of stern command.
3216,THIRD STATUE.,"From his repose the ghastly form arose,"
3217,THIRD STATUE.,"Put forth his bony and gigantic arm,"
3218,THIRD STATUE.,And gave the Amreeta to the Rajah's hand.
3219,THIRD STATUE.,"Take! drink! with accents dread the Spectre said,"
3220,THIRD STATUE.,"For thee and Kailyal hath it been assign'd,"
3221,THIRD STATUE.,{132}
3222,THIRD STATUE.,Ye only of the Children of Mankind.
3223,THIRD STATUE.,
3224,THIRD STATUE.,13.
3225,THIRD STATUE.,Then was the Man-Almighty's heart elate;
3226,THIRD STATUE.,"This is the consummation! he exclaim'd,"
3227,THIRD STATUE.,Thus have I triumphed over Death and Fate.
3228,THIRD STATUE.,"Now, Seeva! look to thine abode!"
3229,THIRD STATUE.,"Henceforth, on equal footing we engage,"
3230,THIRD STATUE.,"Alike immortal now, and we will wage"
3231,THIRD STATUE.,"Our warfare, God to God!"
3232,THIRD STATUE.,"Joy fill'd his impious soul,"
3233,THIRD STATUE.,And to his lips he rais'd the fatal bowl.
3234,THIRD STATUE.,
3235,THIRD STATUE.,14.
3236,THIRD STATUE.,"Thus long the Glendoveer had stood,"
3237,THIRD STATUE.,"Watching the wonders of the eventful hour,"
3238,THIRD STATUE.,Amaz'd but undismay'd; for in his heart
3239,THIRD STATUE.,"Faith, overcoming fear, maintain'd its power."
3240,THIRD STATUE.,"Nor had that faith abated, when the God"
3241,THIRD STATUE.,Of Padalon was beaten down in fight;
3242,THIRD STATUE.,For then he look'd to see the heavenly might
3243,THIRD STATUE.,Of Seeva break upon them. But when now
3244,THIRD STATUE.,"He saw the Amreeta in Kehama's hand,"
3245,THIRD STATUE.,An impulse which denied all self-command
3246,THIRD STATUE.,{133}
3247,THIRD STATUE.,In that extremity
3248,THIRD STATUE.,"Stung him, and he resolved to seize the cup,"
3249,THIRD STATUE.,And dare the Rajah's force in Seeva's sight.
3250,THIRD STATUE.,"Forward he sprung to tempt the unequal fray,"
3251,THIRD STATUE.,"When lo! the Anatomy,"
3252,THIRD STATUE.,"With warning arm, withstood his desperate way,"
3253,THIRD STATUE.,And from the Golden Throne the fiery Three
3254,THIRD STATUE.,"Again, in one accord, renew'd their song,"
3255,THIRD STATUE.,"Kehama, come! we wait for thee too long."
3256,THIRD STATUE.,
3257,THIRD STATUE.,15.
3258,THIRD STATUE.,O fool of drunken hope and frantic vice!
3259,THIRD STATUE.,Madman! to seek for power beyond thy scope
3260,THIRD STATUE.,"Of knowledge, and to deem"
3261,THIRD STATUE.,Less than omniscience could suffice
3262,THIRD STATUE.,"To wield omnipotence! O fool, to dream"
3263,THIRD STATUE.,That immortality could be
3264,THIRD STATUE.,"The meed of evil! . . yea thou hast it now,"
3265,THIRD STATUE.,"Victim of thine own wicked heart's device,"
3266,THIRD STATUE.,"Thou hast thine object now, and now must pay the price."
3267,THIRD STATUE.,
3268,THIRD STATUE.,16.
3269,THIRD STATUE.,He did not know the awful mystery
3270,THIRD STATUE.,"Of that divinest cup, that as the lips"
3271,THIRD STATUE.,{134}
3272,THIRD STATUE.,"Which touch it, even such its quality,"
3273,THIRD STATUE.,Good or malignant: Madman! and he thinks
3274,THIRD STATUE.,"The blessed prize is won, and joyfully he drinks."
3275,THIRD STATUE.,
3276,THIRD STATUE.,17.
3277,THIRD STATUE.,Then Seeva opened on the Accursed One
3278,THIRD STATUE.,His Eye of Anger: upon him alone
3279,THIRD STATUE.,The wrath-beam fell. He shudders . . . but too late;
3280,THIRD STATUE.,"The deed is done,"
3281,THIRD STATUE.,The dreadful liquor works the will of Fate.
3282,THIRD STATUE.,"Immortal he would be,"
3283,THIRD STATUE.,Immortal he remains; but through his veins
3284,THIRD STATUE.,"Torture at once and immortality,"
3285,THIRD STATUE.,"A stream of poison doth the Amreeta run,"
3286,THIRD STATUE.,Infinite everlasting agony.
3287,THIRD STATUE.,"And while within the burning anguish flows,"
3288,THIRD STATUE.,His outward body glows
3289,THIRD STATUE.,"Like molten ore beneath the avenging eye,"
3290,THIRD STATUE.,Doom'd thus to live and burn eternally.
3291,THIRD STATUE.,"The fiery Three,"
3292,THIRD STATUE.,"Beholding him, set up a fiendish cry,"
3293,THIRD STATUE.,A song of jubilee:
3294,THIRD STATUE.,"Come, Brother, come! they sung; too long"
3295,THIRD STATUE.,We in our torments have expected thee;
3296,THIRD STATUE.,{135}
3297,THIRD STATUE.,"Come, Brother, come! henceforth we bear no more"
3298,THIRD STATUE.,"The unequal weight; Come, Brother, we are Four!"
3299,THIRD STATUE.,
3300,THIRD STATUE.,18.
3301,THIRD STATUE.,"Vain his almightiness, for mightier pain"
3302,THIRD STATUE.,Subdued all power; pain ruled supreme alone.
3303,THIRD STATUE.,And yielding to the bony hand
3304,THIRD STATUE.,"The unemptied cup, he mov'd toward the throne,"
3305,THIRD STATUE.,And at the vacant corner took his stand.
3306,THIRD STATUE.,"Behold the Golden Throne at length compleat,"
3307,THIRD STATUE.,And Yamen silently ascends the Judgement-Seat.
3308,THIRD STATUE.,
3309,THIRD STATUE.,19.
3310,THIRD STATUE.,"For two alone, of all mankind, to me"
3311,THIRD STATUE.,"The Amreeta-Cup was given,"
3312,THIRD STATUE.,Then said the Anatomy;
3313,THIRD STATUE.,"The Man hath drank, the Woman's turn is next."
3314,THIRD STATUE.,"Come, Kailyal, come, receive thy doom,"
3315,THIRD STATUE.,And do the Will of Heaven! . .
3316,THIRD STATUE.,"Wonder, and Fear, and Awe at once perplext"
3317,THIRD STATUE.,"The mortal Maiden's heart, but over all"
3318,THIRD STATUE.,"Hope rose triumphant. With a trembling hand,"
3319,THIRD STATUE.,"Obedient to his call,"
3320,THIRD STATUE.,"She took the fated Cup; and, lifting up"
3321,THIRD STATUE.,{136}
3322,THIRD STATUE.,"Her eyes, where holy tears began to swell,"
3323,THIRD STATUE.,"Is it not your command,"
3324,THIRD STATUE.,"Ye heavenly Powers? as on her knees she fell,"
3325,THIRD STATUE.,The pious Virgin cried;
3326,THIRD STATUE.,"Ye know my innocent will, my heart sincere,"
3327,THIRD STATUE.,"Ye govern all things still,"
3328,THIRD STATUE.,And wherefore should I fear!
3329,THIRD STATUE.,
3330,THIRD STATUE.,20.
3331,THIRD STATUE.,"She said, and drank. The Eye of Mercy beam'd"
3332,THIRD STATUE.,Upon the Maid: a cloud of fragrance steam'd
3333,THIRD STATUE.,"Like incense-smoke, as all her mortal frame"
3334,THIRD STATUE.,Dissolved beneath the potent agency
3335,THIRD STATUE.,"Of that mysterious draught; such quality,"
3336,THIRD STATUE.,"From her pure touch, the fated Cup partook."
3337,THIRD STATUE.,"Like one entranced she knelt,"
3338,THIRD STATUE.,Feeling her body melt
3339,THIRD STATUE.,Till all but what was heavenly past away:
3340,THIRD STATUE.,Yet still she felt
3341,THIRD STATUE.,"Her spirit strong within her, the same heart,"
3342,THIRD STATUE.,"With the same loves, and all her heavenly part,"
3343,THIRD STATUE.,"Unchanged, and ripen'd to such perfect state,"
3344,THIRD STATUE.,"In this miraculous birth, as here on Earth,"

3405,NOTES.,
3406,NOTES.,"The _Burghut_, or Banian, often measures from twenty-four to thirty feet"
3407,NOTES.,"in girth. It is distinguished from every other tree hitherto known, by"
3408,NOTES.,the very peculiar circumstance of throwing out roots from all its
3409,NOTES.,"branches. These, being pendant, and perfectly lax, in time reach the"
3410,NOTES.,"ground, which they penetrate, and ultimately become substantial props to"
3411,NOTES.,"the very massy horizontal boughs, which, but for such a support, must"
3412,NOTES.,"either be stopt in their growth, or give way, from their own weight."
3413,NOTES.,"Many of these _quondam_ roots, changing their outward appearance from a"
3414,NOTES.,"brown rough rind to a regular bark, not unlike that of the beech,"
3415,NOTES.,increase to a great diameter. They may be often seen from four to five
3416,NOTES.,"feet in circumference, and {142} in a true perpendicular line. An"
3417,NOTES.,"observer, ignorant of their nature, might think them artificial, and"
3418,NOTES.,that they had been placed for the purpose of sustaining the boughs from
3419,NOTES.,which they originated. They proceed from all the branches
3420,NOTES.,"indiscriminately, whether near or far removed from the ground. They"
3421,NOTES.,"appear like new swabs, such as are in use on board ships: however, few"
3422,NOTES.,"reach sufficiently low to take a hold of the soil, except those of the"
3423,NOTES.,"lower branches. I have seen some do so from a great height, but they"
3424,NOTES.,"were thin, and did not promise well. Many of the ramifications pendant"
3425,NOTES.,"from the higher boughs are seen to turn round the lower branches, but"
3426,NOTES.,"without any obvious effect on either; possibly, however, they may derive"
3427,NOTES.,"sustenance, even from that partial mode of communication. The height of"
3428,NOTES.,"a full-grown Banian may be from sixty to eighty feet; and many of them,"
3429,NOTES.,"I am fully confident, cover at least two acres. Their leaves are similar"
3430,NOTES.,"to, but rather larger than those of the laurel. The wood of the trunk is"
3431,NOTES.,used only for fuel; it is light and brittle; but the pillars formed by
3432,NOTES.,"the roots are valuable, being extremely elastic and light, working with"
3433,NOTES.,"ease, and possessing great toughness: it resembles a good kind of"
3434,NOTES.,"ash.--_Oriental Field Sports_, vol. ii. p. 113."

3468,NOTES.,"formed by throwing a mound or bank across a valley or hollow ground, so"
3469,NOTES.,"that the rain water collects in the upper part of the valley, and is let"
3470,NOTES.,"out on the lower part by sluices, for the purposes of cultivation. The"
3471,NOTES.,"other kind is the _Culam_, which is formed by digging out the earth, and"

3477,NOTES.,"Where there are no springs or rivers to furnish them with water, as it"
3478,NOTES.,"is in the northern parts, where there are but two or three springs, they"
3479,NOTES.,supply this defect by saving of rain water; which they do by casting up
3480,NOTES.,"great banks in convenient places, to stop and contain the rains that"
3481,NOTES.,"fall, and so save it till they have occasion to let it out into the"
3482,NOTES.,"fields: They are made rounding, like a C, or half-moon. Every town has"
3483,NOTES.,"one of these ponds, which, if they can get but filled with water, they"
3484,NOTES.,count their corn is as good as in the barn. It was no small work to the
3485,NOTES.,"ancient inhabitants to make all these banks, of which there is a great"
3486,NOTES.,"number, being some two, some three fathoms in height, and in length some"
3487,NOTES.,"above a mile, some {145} less, not all of a size. They are now grown"
3488,NOTES.,"over with great trees, and so seem natural hills. When they would use"
3489,NOTES.,"the water, they cut a gap in one end of the bank, and so draw the water"
3490,NOTES.,"by little and little, as they have occasion, for the watering their"
3491,NOTES.,corn.
3492,NOTES.,
3493,NOTES.,"These ponds, in dry weather, dry up quite. If they should dig these"
3494,NOTES.,"ponds deep, it would not be so convenient for them. It would indeed"
3495,NOTES.,"contain the water well, but would not so well, nor in such plenty, empty"
3496,NOTES.,"out itself into their grounds. In these ponds are alligators, which,"
3497,NOTES.,"when the water is dried up, depart into the woods, and down to the"
3498,NOTES.,"rivers, and, in the time of rains, come up again into the ponds. They"
3499,NOTES.,"are but small, nor do use to catch people, nevertheless they stand in"

3523,NOTES.,The materials of which these houses are made are always easy to be

3525,NOTES.,"means uncomfortable dwelling, suited to the climate, may be erected in"
3526,NOTES.,"one day. Our habitation, consisting of three small rooms, and a hall"
3527,NOTES.,"open to the north, in little more than four hours was in readiness for"
3528,NOTES.,"our reception; fifty or sixty labourers completed it in that time, and"
3529,NOTES.,"on emergency could perform the work in much less. Bamboos, grass for"
3530,NOTES.,"thatching, and the ground rattan, are all the materials requisite: not a"
3531,NOTES.,"nail is used in the whole edifice: A row of strong bamboos, from eight"
3532,NOTES.,"to ten feet high, are fixed firm in the ground, which describe the"
3533,NOTES.,"outline, and are the supporters of the building: smaller bamboos are"
3534,NOTES.,"then tied horizontally, by strips of the ground rattan, to these upright"
3535,NOTES.,"posts: {147} The walls, composed of bamboo mats, are fastened to the"
3536,NOTES.,"sides with similar ligatures: bamboo rafters are quickly raised, and a"
3537,NOTES.,"roof formed, over which thatch is spread in regular layers, and bound to"
3538,NOTES.,the roof by filaments of rattan. A floor of bamboo grating is next laid
3539,NOTES.,"in the inside, elevated two or three feet above the ground: this grating"
3540,NOTES.,"is supported on bamboos, and covered with mats and carpets. Thus ends"
3541,NOTES.,"the process, which is not more simple than effectual. When the workmen"
3542,NOTES.,"take pains, a house of this sort is proof against very inclement"
3543,NOTES.,"weather. We experienced, during our stay at Meeday, a severe storm of"
3544,NOTES.,"wind and rain, but no water penetrated, nor thatch escaped: and if the"
3545,NOTES.,"tempest should blow down the house, the inhabitants would run no risk of"
3546,NOTES.,"having, their brains knocked out, or their bones broken; the fall of the"

3903,NOTES.,called) to the service of the presiding divinity of the pagoda. They
3904,NOTES.,"were trained up in every art to delude and to delight; and, to the"
3905,NOTES.,"fascination of external beauty, their artful betrayers added the"
3906,NOTES.,attractions arising from mental accomplishments. Thus was an invariable
3907,NOTES.,"rule of the Hindoos, _that women have no concern with literature_,"
3908,NOTES.,dispensed with upon this infamous occasion. The moment these hapless
3909,NOTES.,"victims reached maturity, they fell victims to the lust of the Brahmins."
3910,NOTES.,"They were early taught to practise the most alluring blandishments, to"

3913,NOTES.,voluptuous languishing. They were instructed to mould their elegant and
3914,NOTES.,airy forms into the most enticing attitudes and the most lascivious
3915,NOTES.,"gestures, while the rapid and graceful motion of their feet, adorned"
3916,NOTES.,"with golden bells, and glittering with jewels, kept unison with the"
3917,NOTES.,exquisite melody of their voices. Every pagoda has a band of these young
3918,NOTES.,"syrens, whose business, on great festivals, is to dance in public before"

3920,NOTES.,treasury of that pagoda with the wages of prostitution. These women are

3990,NOTES.,"A rock, or rather hill of stone, is that which first engrosses the"
3991,NOTES.,attention on approaching the place; for as it rises abruptly out of a
3992,NOTES.,"level plain of great extent, consists chiefly of one single stone, and"
3993,NOTES.,"is situated very near to the sea-beach, it is such a kind of object as"
3994,NOTES.,an inquisitive traveller would naturally turn aside to examine. Its
3995,NOTES.,"shape is also singular and romantic, and, from a distant view, has an"
3996,NOTES.,appearance like some antique and lofty edifice. On coming near to the
3997,NOTES.,"foot of the rock from the north, works of imagery and sculpture crowd so"
3998,NOTES.,"thick upon the eye, as might seem to favour the idea of {167} a"
3999,NOTES.,"petrified town, like those that have been fabled in different parts of"
4000,NOTES.,"the world, by too credulous travellers. Proceeding on by the foot of the"
4001,NOTES.,"hill, on the side facing the sea, there is a pagoda rising out of the"
4002,NOTES.,"ground, of one solid stone, about sixteen or eighteen feet high, which"
4003,NOTES.,"seems to have been cut upon the spot, out of a detached rock, that has"
4004,NOTES.,"been found of a proper size for that purpose. The top is arched, and the"
4005,NOTES.,style of architecture according to which it is formed different from any
4006,NOTES.,"now used in those parts. A little further on, there appears, upon a huge"
4007,NOTES.,"surface of stone, that juts out a little from the side of the hill, a"
4008,NOTES.,"numerous group of human figures, in bass-relief, considerably larger"
4009,NOTES.,"than life, representing the most remarkable persons whose actions are"
4010,NOTES.,"celebrated in the Nahâbharit, each of them in an attitude, or with"
4011,NOTES.,"weapons, or other insignia, expressive of his character, or of some one"
4012,NOTES.,of his most famous exploits. All these figures are doubtless much less
4013,NOTES.,distinct than they were at first; for upon comparing these and the rest
4014,NOTES.,"of the sculptures that are exposed to the sea-air, with others at the"
4015,NOTES.,"same place, whose situation has afforded them protection from that"
4016,NOTES.,"element, the difference is striking; the former being every where much"
4017,NOTES.,"defaced, while the others are fresh as recently finished. An excavation"
4018,NOTES.,in another part of the east side of the great rock appears {168} to have
4019,NOTES.,"been made on the same plan, and for the same purpose, that Chowltries"
4020,NOTES.,"are usually built in that country, that is to say, for the accommodation"
4021,NOTES.,"of travellers. The rock is hollowed out to the size of a spacious room,"
4022,NOTES.,"and two or three rows of pillars are left, as a seeming support to the"
4023,NOTES.,mountainous mass of stone which forms the roof.
4024,NOTES.,
4025,NOTES.,"The ascent of the hill on the north is, from its natural shape, gradual"
4026,NOTES.,"and easy at first, and is in other parts rendered more so, by very"
4027,NOTES.,"excellent steps, cut out in several places where the communication would"
4028,NOTES.,be difficult or impracticable without them. A winding stair of this sort
4029,NOTES.,"leads to a kind of temple cut out of the solid rock, with some figures"
4030,NOTES.,"of idols in high relief upon the walls, very well finished. From this"
4031,NOTES.,"temple there are flights of steps, that seem to have led to some edifice"
4032,NOTES.,formerly standing upon the hill; nor does it seem absurd to suppose that
4033,NOTES.,"this may have been a palace, to which this temple may have appertained;"
4034,NOTES.,"for, besides the small detached range of stairs that are here and there"
4035,NOTES.,"cut in the rock, and seem as if they had once led to different parts of"
4036,NOTES.,"one great building, there appear in many places small water channels cut"
4037,NOTES.,"also in the rock, as if for drains to an house; and the whole top of the"
4038,NOTES.,"hill is strewed with small round pieces of brick, which may be supposed,"
4039,NOTES.,"{169} from their appearance, to have been worn down to their present"
4040,NOTES.,"form during the lapse of many ages. On a plain surface of the rock,"
4041,NOTES.,"which may once have served as the floor of some apartment, there is a"
4042,NOTES.,"platform of stone, about 8 or 9 feet long, by 3 or 4 wide, in a"
4043,NOTES.,"situation rather elevated, with two or three steps leading up to it,"
4044,NOTES.,"perfectly resembling a couch or bed, and a lion very well executed at"
4045,NOTES.,"the upper end of it, by way of pillow; the whole of one piece, being"
4046,NOTES.,"part of the hill itself. This the Bramins, inhabitants of the place,"
4047,NOTES.,"call the bed of Dhermarâjah, or Judishter, the eldest of the five"
4048,NOTES.,"brothers, whose exploits are the leading subject in the Mahabhârit. And"
4049,NOTES.,"at a considerable distance from this, at such a distance, indeed, as the"
4050,NOTES.,"apartments of the women might be supposed to be from that of the men, is"
4051,NOTES.,"a bath, excavated also from the rock, with steps in the inside, which"
4052,NOTES.,"the Bramins call the Bath of Dropedy, the wife of Judishter and his"
4053,NOTES.,"brothers. How much credit is due to this tradition, and whether this"
4054,NOTES.,"stone couch may not have been anciently used as a kind of throne, rather"
4055,NOTES.,"than a bed, is matter for future enquiry. A circumstance, however, which"
4056,NOTES.,"may seem to favour this idea is, that a throne, in the Shanscrit and"
4057,NOTES.,"other Hindoo languages, is called _Singhâsen_, which is compounded of"
4058,NOTES.,"_Sing_, a lion, and _ásen_, a seat."
4059,NOTES.,
4060,NOTES.,{170}
4061,NOTES.,
4062,NOTES.,"But though these works may be deemed stupendous, they are surpassed by"
4063,NOTES.,"others that are to be seen at the distance of about a mile, or mile and"
4064,NOTES.,"half, to the south of the hill. They consist of two pagodas, of about"
4065,NOTES.,"30 feet long, by 20 feet wide, and about as many in height, cut out of"
4066,NOTES.,"the solid rock, and each consisting originally of one single stone."
4067,NOTES.,Their form is different from the style of architecture according to
4068,NOTES.,which idol temples are now built in that country. These sculptures
4069,NOTES.,"approach nearer to the Gothic taste, being surmounted by arched roofs,"
4070,NOTES.,"or domes, not semicircular, but composed of two segments of circles"
4071,NOTES.,meeting in a point at top. Near these also stand an elephant full as big
4072,NOTES.,"as life, and a lion much larger than the natural size, both hewn also"
4073,NOTES.,out of one stone.
4074,NOTES.,
4075,NOTES.,The great rock is about 50 or 100 yards from the sea; but close to the
4076,NOTES.,"sea are the remains of a pagoda built of brick, and dedicated to Sîb,"
4077,NOTES.,the greatest part of which has evidently been swallowed up by that
4078,NOTES.,"element; for the door of the innermost apartment, in which the idol is"
4079,NOTES.,"placed, and before which there are always two or three spacious courts"
4080,NOTES.,"surrounded with walls, is now washed by the waves, and the pillar used"
4081,NOTES.,to discover the meridian at the time of founding the pagoda is seen
4082,NOTES.,standing at some distance in the sea. In the neighbourhood of {171} this
4083,NOTES.,"building there are some detached rocks, washed also by the waves, on"
4084,NOTES.,"which there appear sculptures, though now much worn and defaced: And the"
4085,NOTES.,"natives of the place declared to the writer of this account, that the"
4086,NOTES.,more aged people among them remembered to have seen the tops of several
4087,NOTES.,"pagodas far out in the sea, which, being covered with copper, (probably"
4088,NOTES.,"gilt,) were particularly visible at sun-rise, as their shining surface"
4089,NOTES.,"used then to reflect the sun's rays, but that now that effect was no"

4397,NOTES.,"of her body and bill, as likewise the form of them, is much the same as"
4398,NOTES.,a swallow's; but the spreading out of her wings and tail has no less
4399,NOTES.,"compass than an eagle's. She lives and breeds in the air, comes not near"
4400,NOTES.,"the earth but for her burial, for the largeness and lightness of her"
4401,NOTES.,wings and tail sustain her without lassitude. And the laying of her
4402,NOTES.,"eggs, and breeding of her young, is upon the back of the male, which is"
4403,NOTES.,"made hollow, as also the breast of the female, for the more easy"
4404,NOTES.,"incubation. Also two strings, like two shoemaker's ends, come from the"
4405,NOTES.,"hinder parts of the male, wherewith it is conceived that he is fastened"
4406,NOTES.,"closer to the female, while she hatches her eggs on the hollow of {184}"
4407,NOTES.,"his back. The dew of heaven is appointed her for food, her region being"
4408,NOTES.,too far removed from the approach of flies and such like insects.
4409,NOTES.,
4410,NOTES.,This is the entire story and philosophy of this miraculous bird in
4411,NOTES.,"_Cardan_, who professes himself to have seen it no less than thrice, and"
4412,NOTES.,"to have described it accordingly. The contrivances whereof, if the"
4413,NOTES.,"matter were certainly true, are as evident arguments of a Divine"
4414,NOTES.,"Providence, as that copper-ring, with the Greek[36] inscription upon"
4415,NOTES.,"it, was an undeniable monument of the artifice and finger of man."
4416,NOTES.,
4417,NOTES.,But that the reproach of over-much credulity may not lie upon _Cardan_
4418,NOTES.,"alone, Scaliger, who lay at catch with him to take him tripping wherever"
4419,NOTES.,"he could, cavils not with any thing in the whole narration but the"
4420,NOTES.,bigness of wings and the littleness of the body; which he undertakes to
4421,NOTES.,correct from one of his own which was sent him by _Orvesanus_ from Java.
4422,NOTES.,"Nay, he confirms what his antagonist has wrote, partly by history and"
4423,NOTES.,"partly by reason; affirming, that himself, in his own garden, found two"
4424,NOTES.,"{185} little birds with membranaceous wings utterly devoid of legs,"
4425,NOTES.,their form was near to that of a bat's. Nor is he deterred from the
4426,NOTES.,"belief of the perpetual flying of the _Manucodiata_, by the gaping of"
4427,NOTES.,"the feathers of her wings, which seem thereby less fit to sustain her"
4428,NOTES.,"body, but further makes the narration probable by what he has observed"
4429,NOTES.,"in kites hovering in the air, as he saith, for a whole hour together"
4430,NOTES.,"without flapping of her wings, or changing place. And he has found also"
4431,NOTES.,"how she may sleep in the air, from the example of fishes, which he has"
4432,NOTES.,"seen sleeping in the water without sinking themselves to the bottom, and"
4433,NOTES.,"without changing place, but lying stock still, _pinnulis tantum nescia"
4434,NOTES.,"quid motiuncule meditantes_, only wagging a little their fins, as"
4435,NOTES.,heedlessly and unconcernedly as horses while they are asleep wag their
4436,NOTES.,ears to displace the flies that sit upon them. Wherever Scaliger
4437,NOTES.,"admitting that the Menucodiata is perpetually on the wing in the air, he"
4438,NOTES.,must of necessity admit also that manner of incubation that Cardan
4439,NOTES.,"describes, else how could their generations continue?"
4440,NOTES.,
4441,NOTES.,Franciscus Hernandeo affirms the same with Cardan expressly in every
4442,NOTES.,"thing: As also Eusebius Nierembergius, who is so taken with the story of"
4443,NOTES.,"this bird, that he could not abstain from celebrating her miraculous"
4444,NOTES.,"properties in a short but elegant copy of verses; and does {186} after,"
4445,NOTES.,"though confidently opposed, assert the main matter again in prose."
4446,NOTES.,
4447,NOTES.,"Such are the sufferages of Cardan, Scaliger, Hernandeo, Nierembergius."
4448,NOTES.,"But Aldrovandus rejects that fable of her feeding on the dew of heaven,"
4449,NOTES.,"and of her incubiture on the back of the male, with much scorn and"
4450,NOTES.,"indignation. And as for the former, his reasons are no ways"
4451,NOTES.,"contemptible, he alledging that dew is a body not perfectly enough"
4452,NOTES.,"mixed, or heterogenial enough for food, nor the hard bill of the bird"
4453,NOTES.,made for such easie uses as sipping this soft moisture.
4454,NOTES.,
4455,NOTES.,"To which I know not what Cardan and the rest would answer, unless this,"
4456,NOTES.,"that they mean by dew the more unctuous moisture of the air, which as it"
4457,NOTES.,"may not be alike every where, so these birds may be fitted with a"
4458,NOTES.,natural sagacity to find it out where it is. That there is dew in this
4459,NOTES.,"sense day and night, (as well as in the morning,) and in all seasons of"
4460,NOTES.,the year; and therefore a constant supply of moisture and spirits to
4461,NOTES.,"their perpetual flying, which they more copiously imbibe by reason of"
4462,NOTES.,their exercise: That the thicker parts of this moisture stick and
4463,NOTES.,"convert into flesh, and that the lightness of their feathers is so"
4464,NOTES.,"great, that their pains in sustaining themselves are not over-much. That"
4465,NOTES.,what is homogeneal and simple to our sight is fit enough to be the
4466,NOTES.,"rudiments of generation, {187} all animals being generated of a kind of"
4467,NOTES.,"clear crystalline liquor; and that, therefore, it may be also of"
4468,NOTES.,"nutrition; that orpine and sea-house-leek are nourished and grow, being"
4469,NOTES.,"hung in the air, and that dock-weed has its root no deeper than near the"
4470,NOTES.,"upper parts of the water; and, lastly, that the bills of these birds are"
4471,NOTES.,"for their better flying, by cutting the way, and for better ornament;"
4472,NOTES.,"for the rectifying also and composing of their feathers, while they swim"
4473,NOTES.,in the air with as much ease as swans do in river.
4474,NOTES.,
4475,NOTES.,"To his great impatiency against their manner of incubation, they would"
4476,NOTES.,happily return this answer: That the way is not ridiculous; but it may
4477,NOTES.,be rather necessary from what Aldrovandus himself not only acknowledges
4478,NOTES.,"but contends for, namely, that they have no feet at all. For hence it is"
4479,NOTES.,"manifest, that they cannot light upon the ground, nor any where rest on"
4480,NOTES.,"their bellies, and be able to get on wing again, because they cannot"
4481,NOTES.,"creep out of holes of rocks, as swifts and such like short-footed birds"
4482,NOTES.,"can, they having no feet at all to creep with. Besides, as Aristotle"
4483,NOTES.,"well argues concerning the long legs of certain water-fowl, that they"
4484,NOTES.,"were made so long, because they were to wade in the water and catch"
4485,NOTES.,"fish, adding that excellent aphorism, τὰ γαρ ὄργανα"
4486,NOTES.,πρὸς τὸ ἔργον ἡ φύσις ποιεῖ ἀλλ᾽ ὐ
4487,NOTES.,"τὸ ἔργον πρὸς τὰ ὄργανα, so may we rationally"
4488,NOTES.,"conclude, will they say, that as the long legs of these water-fowl {188}"
4489,NOTES.,"imply a design of their haunting the water, so want of legs in these"
4490,NOTES.,"Manucodiatas argue they are never to come down to the earth, because"
4491,NOTES.,they can neither stand there nor get off again. And if they never come
4492,NOTES.,"on the earth, or any other resting-place, where can their eggs be laid"
4493,NOTES.,or hatched but on the back of the male?
4494,NOTES.,
4495,NOTES.,"Besides that Cardan pleases himself with that Antiphonie in nature, that"
4496,NOTES.,"as the Ostrich being a bird, yet never flies in the air, and never rests"
4497,NOTES.,"upon the earth. And as for Aldrovandus, his presumption from the five"
4498,NOTES.,"several Manucodiatas that he had seen, and in which he could observe no"
4499,NOTES.,such figuration of parts as implied a fitness for such a manner of
4500,NOTES.,"incubation, Cardan will answer, Myself has seen three, and Scaliger one,"
4501,NOTES.,who both agree against you.
4502,NOTES.,
4503,NOTES.,"However, you see that both Cardan, Aldrovandus, and the rest do jointly"
4504,NOTES.,"agree in allowing the Manucodiata no feet, as also in furnishing her"
4505,NOTES.,"with two strings, hanging at the hinder parts of her body, which"
4506,NOTES.,"Aldrovandus will have to be in the female as well as in the male, though"
4507,NOTES.,Cardan's experience reacheth not so far.
4508,NOTES.,
4509,NOTES.,But Pighafetta and Clusius will easily end this grand controversy
4510,NOTES.,"betwixt Cardan and Aldrovandus, if it be true which they report, and if"
4511,NOTES.,they speak of the same kind of Birds of Paradise. For they both affirm
4512,NOTES.,"that they {189} have feet a palm long, and that with all confidence"
4513,NOTES.,"imaginable; but Nierembergius on the contrary affirms, that one that was"
4514,NOTES.,"an eye witness, and that had taken up one of these birds newly dead,"
4515,NOTES.,told him that it had no feet at all. Johnston also gives his suffrage
4516,NOTES.,"with Nierembergius in this, though with Aldrovandus he rejects the"
4517,NOTES.,manner of their incubation.
4518,NOTES.,
4519,NOTES.,But unless they can raise themselves from the ground by the stiffness of
4520,NOTES.,"some of the feathers of their wings, or rather by virtue of those"
4521,NOTES.,nervous strings which they may have a power to stiffen when they are
4522,NOTES.,"alive, by transfusing spirits into them, and making them serve as well"
4523,NOTES.,instead of legs to raise them from the ground as to hang upon the boughs
4524,NOTES.,"of trees, by a slight thing being able to raise or hold up their"
4525,NOTES.,"light-feathered bodies in the air, as a small twig will us in the water,"
4526,NOTES.,I should rather incline to the testimony of Pighafetta and Clusius than
4527,NOTES.,"to the judgment of the rest, and believe those mariners that told him"
4528,NOTES.,"that the legs are pulled off by them that take them, and extenterate"

4583,NOTES.,

4879,NOTES.,"and Ananta arose, and was instructed in that work by Brahma, and"
4880,NOTES.,"commanded by _Narayan_ to perform it. Then _Ananta_, by his power, took up"
4881,NOTES.,"that king of mountains, together with all its forests and every"
4882,NOTES.,inhabitant thereof; and the _Soors_ accompanied him into the presence of
4883,NOTES.,"the Ocean, whom they addressed, saying, 'We will stir up thy waters to"
4884,NOTES.,"obtain the _Amreeta_,' And the Lord of the Waters replied, 'Let me also"
4885,NOTES.,"have a share, seeing I am to bear the violent agitation that will be"
4886,NOTES.,caused by the whirling of the {205} mountain!' Then the _Soors_ and
4887,NOTES.,"_Asoors_ spoke unto _Koorna-raj_, the King of the Tortoises, upon the"
4888,NOTES.,"strand of the Ocean, and said, 'My lord is able to be the supporter of"
4889,NOTES.,"this mountain.' The Tortoise replied, 'Be it so;' and it was placed upon"
4890,NOTES.,his back.
4891,NOTES.,
4892,NOTES.,"""So the mountain being set upon the back of the Tortoise, _Eendra_ began"
4893,NOTES.,to whirl it about as it were a machine. The mountain _Mandar_ served as
4894,NOTES.,"a churn, and the serpent _Vasoakee_ for the rope; and thus in former"
4895,NOTES.,"days did the _Dews_, and _Asoors_, and the _Danoos_, begin to stir up"
4896,NOTES.,the waters of the ocean for the discovery of the _Amreeta_.
4897,NOTES.,
4898,NOTES.,"""The mighty _Asoors_ were employed on the side of the serpent's head,"
4899,NOTES.,"whilst all the _Soors_ assembled about his tail. _Ananta_, that sovereign"
4900,NOTES.,"_Dew_, stood near _Narayan_."
4901,NOTES.,
4902,NOTES.,"""They now pull forth the serpent's head repeatedly, and as often let it"
4903,NOTES.,"go; whilst there issued from his mouth, thus violently drawing to and"
4904,NOTES.,"fro by the _Soors_ and _Asoors_, a continual stream of fire and smoke"
4905,NOTES.,"and wind, which ascending in thick clouds, replete with lightning, it"
4906,NOTES.,"began to rain down upon the heavenly bands, who were already fatigued"
4907,NOTES.,with their labour; whilst a shower of flowers was shaken from the top of
4908,NOTES.,"the mountain, covering the heads of all, both _Soors_ and {206}"
4909,NOTES.,"_Asoors_. In the mean time the roaring of the ocean, whilst violently"
4910,NOTES.,agitated with the whirling of the mountain _Mandar_ by the _Soors_ and
4911,NOTES.,"_Asoors_, was like the bellowing of a mighty cloud. Thousands of the"
4912,NOTES.,"various productions of the waters were torn to pieces by the mountain,"
4913,NOTES.,and confounded with the briny flood; and every specific being of the
4914,NOTES.,"deep, and all the inhabitants of the great abyss which is below the"
4915,NOTES.,"earth, were annihilated; whilst, from the violent agitation of the"
4916,NOTES.,"mountain, the forest trees were dashed against each other, and"
4917,NOTES.,"precipitated from its utmost height, with all the birds thereon; from"
4918,NOTES.,"whose violent confrication a raging fire was produced, involving the"
4919,NOTES.,"whole mountain with smoke and flame, as with a dark-blue cloud, and the"
4920,NOTES.,lightning's vivid flash. The lion and the retreating elephant are
4921,NOTES.,"overtaken by the devouring flames, and every vital being, and every"
4922,NOTES.,"specific thing, are consumed in the general conflagration."
4923,NOTES.,
4924,NOTES.,"""The raging flames, thus spreading destruction on all sides, were at"
4925,NOTES.,"length quenched by a shower of cloud-borne water, poured down by the"
4926,NOTES.,immortal Eendra. And now a heterogeneous stream of the concocted juices
4927,NOTES.,of various trees and plants ran down into the briny flood.
4928,NOTES.,
4929,NOTES.,"""It was from this milk-like stream of juices, produced {207} from those"
4930,NOTES.,"trees and plants and a mixture of melted gold, that the _Soors_ obtained"
4931,NOTES.,their immortality.
4932,NOTES.,
4933,NOTES.,"""The waters of the Ocean now being assimilated with those juices, were"
4934,NOTES.,"converted into milk, and from that milk a kind of butter was presently"
4935,NOTES.,produced; when the heavenly bands went again into the presence of
4936,NOTES.,"_Brahma_, the granter of boons, and addressed him, saying, 'Except"
4937,NOTES.,"_Narayan_, every other _Soor_ and _Asoor_ is fatigued with his labour,"
4938,NOTES.,and still the _Amreeta_ doth not appear; wherefore the churning of the
4939,NOTES.,"Ocean is at a stand.' Then _Brahma_ said unto _Narayan_, 'Endue them"
4940,NOTES.,"with recruited strength, for thou art their support.' And _Narayan_"
4941,NOTES.,"answered and said, 'I will give fresh vigour to such as co-operate in"
4942,NOTES.,"the work. Let _Mandar_ be whirled about, and the bed of the ocean be"
4943,NOTES.,kept steady.'
4944,NOTES.,
4945,NOTES.,"""When they heard the words of _Narayan_, they all returned again to the"
4946,NOTES.,"work, and began to stir about with great force that butter of the ocean,"
4947,NOTES.,"when there presently arose from out the troubled deep, first the Moon,"
4948,NOTES.,"with a pleasing countenance, shining with ten thousand beams of gentle"
4949,NOTES.,"light; next followed _Sree_, the goddess of fortune, whose seat is the"
4950,NOTES.,"white lily of the waters; then _Soora-Devee_, the goddess of wine, and"
4951,NOTES.,the white horse called _Oochisrava_. And after these there was produced
4952,NOTES.,"from the unctuous mass the jewel _Kowstoobh_, that glorious {208}"
4953,NOTES.,"sparkling gem worn by Narayan on his breast; also _Pareejat_, the tree"
4954,NOTES.,"of plenty, and _Soorabhee_, the cow that granted every heart's desire."
4955,NOTES.,
4956,NOTES.,"""The moon, _Soora-Devee_, the goddess of _Sree_, and the Horse, as swift"
4957,NOTES.,"as thought, instantly marched away towards the _Dews_, keeping in the"
4958,NOTES.,path of the Sun.
4959,NOTES.,
4960,NOTES.,"""Then the _Dew Dhanwantaree_, in human shape, came forth, holding in his"
4961,NOTES.,hand a white vessel filled with the immortal juice _Amreeta_. When the
4962,NOTES.,"_Asoors_ beheld these wondrous things appear, they raised their"
4963,NOTES.,"tumultuous voices for the _Amreeta_, and each of them clamorously"
4964,NOTES.,"exclaimed, 'This of right is mine.'"
4965,NOTES.,
4966,NOTES.,"""In the mean time _Travat_, a mighty elephant, arose, now kept by the"
4967,NOTES.,god of thunder; and as they continued to churn the ocean more than
4968,NOTES.,"enough, that deadly poison issued from its bed, burning like a raging"
4969,NOTES.,"fire, whose dreadful fumes in a moment spread throughout the world,"
4970,NOTES.,"confounding the three regions of the universe with the mortal stench,"
4971,NOTES.,"until _Seev_, at the word of _Brahma_, swallowed the fatal drug, to save"
4972,NOTES.,"mankind; which, remaining in the throat of that sovereign _Dew_ of magic"
4973,NOTES.,"form, from that time he hath been called _Neel-Kant_, because his throat"
4974,NOTES.,was stained blue.
4975,NOTES.,
4976,NOTES.,"""When the _Asoors_ beheld this miraculous deed, they {209} became"
4977,NOTES.,"desperate, and the _Amreeta_ and the goddess _Sree_ became the source of"
4978,NOTES.,endless hatred.
4979,NOTES.,
4980,NOTES.,"""Then _Narayan_ assumed the character and person of _Moheenee Maya_, the"
4981,NOTES.,"power of enchantment, in a female form of wonderful beauty, and stood"
4982,NOTES.,"before the _Asoors_, whose minds being fascinated by her presence, and"
4983,NOTES.,"deprived of reason, they seized the _Amreeta_, and gave it unto her."
4984,NOTES.,
4985,NOTES.,"""The _Asoors_ now clothe themselves in costly armour, and, seizing their"
4986,NOTES.,"various weapons, rush on together to attack the _Soors_. In the mean"
4987,NOTES.,"time _Narayan_, in the female form, having obtained the _Amreeta_ from"
4988,NOTES.,"the hands of their leader, the hosts of _Soors_, during the tumult and"
4989,NOTES.,"confusion of the _Asoors_, drank of the living water."
4990,NOTES.,
4991,NOTES.,"""And it so fell out, that whilst the _Soors_ were quenching their thirst"
4992,NOTES.,"for immortality, _Rahoo_, an _Asoor_, assumed the form of a _Soor_, and"
4993,NOTES.,"began to drink also: And the water had but reached his throat, when the"
4994,NOTES.,"Sun and Moon, in friendship to the _Soors_, discovered the deceit; and"
4995,NOTES.,"instantly _Narayan_ cut off his head as he was drinking, with his"
4996,NOTES.,"splendid weapon _Chakra_. And the gigantic head of the _Asoor_, emblem"
4997,NOTES.,"of a mountain's summit, being thus separated from his body by the"
4998,NOTES.,"_Chakra's_ edge, bounded into the heavens with a dreadful cry, whilst"
4999,NOTES.,"his ponderous trunk fell, cleaving the ground asunder, and {210} shaking"
5000,NOTES.,"the whole earth unto its foundation, with all its islands, rocks, and"
5001,NOTES.,forests: And from that time the head of Rahoo resolved an eternal
5002,NOTES.,"enmity, and continueth, even unto this day, at times to seize upon the"
5003,NOTES.,Sun and Moon.
5004,NOTES.,
5005,NOTES.,"""Now Narayan, having quitted the female figure he had assumed, began to"
5006,NOTES.,disturb the _Asoors_ with sundry celestial weapons: and from that
5007,NOTES.,"instant a dreadful battle was commenced, on the ocean's briny strand,"
5008,NOTES.,between the _Asoors_ and the _Soors_. Innumerable sharp and missile
5009,NOTES.,"weapons were hurled, and thousands of piercing darts and battle-axes"
5010,NOTES.,fell on all sides. The _Asoors_ vomit blood from the wounds of the
5011,NOTES.,"_Chakra_, and fall upon the ground pierced by the sword, the spear, and"
5012,NOTES.,"spiked club. Heads, glittering with polished gold, divided by the"
5013,NOTES.,"_Pattees'_ blade, drop incessantly; and mangled bodies, wallowing in"
5014,NOTES.,"their gore, lay like fragments of mighty rocks, sparkling with gems and"
5015,NOTES.,precious ores. Millions of sighs and groans arise on every side; and the
5016,NOTES.,"sun is overcast with blood, as they clash their arms, and wound each"
5017,NOTES.,other with their dreadful instruments of destruction.
5018,NOTES.,
5019,NOTES.,"""Now the battle is fought with the iron-spiked club, and, as they close,"
5020,NOTES.,with clenched fist; and the din of war ascendeth to the heavens. They
5021,NOTES.,cry 'Pursue! {211} strike! fell to the ground!' so that a horrid and
5022,NOTES.,tumultuous noise is heard on all sides.
5023,NOTES.,
5024,NOTES.,"""In the midst of this dreadful hurry and confusion of the fight, _Nar_"
5025,NOTES.,"and _Narayan_ entered the field together. _Narayan_, beholding a"
5026,NOTES.,"celestial bow in the hand of _Nar_, it reminded him of his _Chakra_, the"
5027,NOTES.,"destroyer of the _Asoors_. The faithful weapon, by name _Soodarsan_,"
5028,NOTES.,"ready at the mind's call, flew down from heaven with direct and"
5029,NOTES.,"refulgent speed, beautiful, yet terrible to behold: And being arrived,"
5030,NOTES.,"glowing like the sacrificial flame, and spreading terror around,"
5031,NOTES.,"_Narayan_, with his right arm formed like the elephantine trunk, hurled"
5032,NOTES.,"forth the ponderous orb, the speedy messenger and glorious ruin of"
5033,NOTES.,"hostile towns; who, raging like the final all-destroying fire, shot"
5034,NOTES.,"bounding with desolating force, killing thousands of the _Asoors_ in his"
5035,NOTES.,"rapid flight, burning and involving, like the lambent flame, and cutting"
5036,NOTES.,"down all that would oppose him. Anon he climbeth the heavens, and now"
5037,NOTES.,"again darteth into the field like a _Peesach_, to feast in blood."
5038,NOTES.,
5039,NOTES.,"""Now the dauntless _Asoors_ strive, with repeated strength, to crush the"
5040,NOTES.,"_Soors_ with rocks and mountains, which, hurled in vast numbers into the"
5041,NOTES.,"heavens, appeared like scattered clouds, and fell, with all the trees"
5042,NOTES.,"thereon, in millions of fear-exciting torrents, striking {212} violently"
5043,NOTES.,"against each other with a mighty noise; and in their fall the earth,"
5044,NOTES.,"with all its fields and forests, is driven from its foundation: they"
5045,NOTES.,"thunder furiously at each other as they roll along the field, and spend"
5046,NOTES.,their strength in mutual conflict.
5047,NOTES.,
5048,NOTES.,"""Now _Nar_, seeing the _Soors_ overwhelmed with fear, filled up the path"
5049,NOTES.,"to Heaven with showers of golden-headed arrows, and split the mountain"
5050,NOTES.,summits with his unerring shafts; and the _Asoors_ finding themselves
5051,NOTES.,"again sore pressed by the _Soors_, precipitately flee; some rush"
5052,NOTES.,"headlong into the briny waters of the ocean, and others hide themselves"
5053,NOTES.,within the bowels of the earth.
5054,NOTES.,
5055,NOTES.,"""The rage of the glorious _Chakra_, _Soodarsan_, which for a while burnt"
5056,NOTES.,"like the oil-fed fire, now grew cool, and he retired into the heavens"
5057,NOTES.,"from whence he came. And the _Soors_ having obtained the victory, the"
5058,NOTES.,mountain _Mandar_ was carried back to its former station with great
5059,NOTES.,"respect, whilst the waters also retired, filling the firmament and the"
5060,NOTES.,heavens with their dreadful roarings.
5061,NOTES.,
5062,NOTES.,"""The _Soors_ guarded the _Amreeta_ with great care, and rejoiced"
5063,NOTES.,"exceedingly because of their success. And _Eendra_, with all his"
