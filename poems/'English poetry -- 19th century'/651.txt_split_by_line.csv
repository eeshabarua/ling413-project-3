106,CANTO I,The Trystyng
107,CANTO I,
108,CANTO I,
109,CANTO I,"ONE winter night, at half-past nine,"
110,CANTO I,"Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,"
111,CANTO I,"I had come home, too late to dine,"
112,CANTO I,"And supper, with cigars and wine,"
113,CANTO I,Was waiting in the study.
114,CANTO I,
115,CANTO I,"There was a strangeness in the room,"
116,CANTO I,And Something white and wavy
117,CANTO I,Was standing near me in the gloom—
118,CANTO I,_I_ took it for the carpet-broom
119,CANTO I,Left by that careless slavey.
120,CANTO I,
121,CANTO I,But presently the Thing began
122,CANTO I,To shiver and to sneeze:
123,CANTO I,"On which I said “Come, come, my man!"
124,CANTO I,That’s a most inconsiderate plan.
125,CANTO I,"Less noise there, if you please!”"
126,CANTO I,
127,CANTO I,[Picture: The Thing standing by chair]
128,CANTO I,
129,CANTO I,"“I’ve caught a cold,” the Thing replies,"
130,CANTO I,“Out there upon the landing.”
131,CANTO I,"I turned to look in some surprise,"
132,CANTO I,"And there, before my very eyes,"
133,CANTO I,A little Ghost was standing!
134,CANTO I,
135,CANTO I,"He trembled when he caught my eye,"
136,CANTO I,And got behind a chair.
137,CANTO I,"“How came you here,” I said, “and why?"
138,CANTO I,I never saw a thing so shy.
139,CANTO I,Come out!  Don’t shiver there!”
140,CANTO I,
141,CANTO I,"He said “I’d gladly tell you how,"
142,CANTO I,And also tell you why;
143,CANTO I,But” (here he gave a little bow)
144,CANTO I,"“You’re in so bad a temper now,"
145,CANTO I,You’d think it all a lie.
146,CANTO I,
147,CANTO I,"“And as to being in a fright,"
148,CANTO I,Allow me to remark
149,CANTO I,That Ghosts have just as good a right
150,CANTO I,"In every way, to fear the light,"
151,CANTO I,As Men to fear the dark.”
152,CANTO I,
153,CANTO I,"“No plea,” said I, “can well excuse"
154,CANTO I,Such cowardice in you:
155,CANTO I,"For Ghosts can visit when they choose,"
156,CANTO I,Whereas we Humans ca’n’t refuse
157,CANTO I,To grant the interview.”
158,CANTO I,
159,CANTO I,He said “A flutter of alarm
160,CANTO I,"Is not unnatural, is it?"
161,CANTO I,I really feared you meant some harm:
162,CANTO I,"But, now I see that you are calm,"
163,CANTO I,Let me explain my visit.
164,CANTO I,
165,CANTO I,"“Houses are classed, I beg to state,"
166,CANTO I,According to the number
167,CANTO I,Of Ghosts that they accommodate:
168,CANTO I,"(The Tenant merely counts as _weight_,"
169,CANTO I,With Coals and other lumber).
170,CANTO I,
171,CANTO I,"“This is a ‘one-ghost’ house, and you"
172,CANTO I,"When you arrived last summer,"
173,CANTO I,May have remarked a Spectre who
174,CANTO I,Was doing all that Ghosts can do
175,CANTO I,To welcome the new-comer.
176,CANTO I,
177,CANTO I,“In Villas this is always done—
178,CANTO I,However cheaply rented:
179,CANTO I,"For, though of course there’s less of fun"
180,CANTO I,"When there is only room for one,"
181,CANTO I,Ghosts have to be contented.
182,CANTO I,
183,CANTO I,“That Spectre left you on the Third—
184,CANTO I,Since then you’ve not been haunted:
185,CANTO I,"For, as he never sent us word,"
186,CANTO I,’Twas quite by accident we heard
187,CANTO I,That any one was wanted.
188,CANTO I,
189,CANTO I,"“A Spectre has first choice, by right,"
190,CANTO I,In filling up a vacancy;
191,CANTO I,"Then Phantom, Goblin, Elf, and Sprite—"
192,CANTO I,"If all these fail them, they invite"
193,CANTO I,The nicest Ghoul that they can see.
194,CANTO I,
195,CANTO I,"“The Spectres said the place was low,"
196,CANTO I,And that you kept bad wine:
197,CANTO I,"So, as a Phantom had to go,"
198,CANTO I,"And I was first, of course, you know,"
199,CANTO I,I couldn’t well decline.”
200,CANTO I,
201,CANTO I,"“No doubt,” said I, “they settled who"
202,CANTO I,Was fittest to be sent
203,CANTO I,"Yet still to choose a brat like you,"
204,CANTO I,"To haunt a man of forty-two,"
205,CANTO I,Was no great compliment!”
206,CANTO I,
207,CANTO I,"“I’m not so young, Sir,” he replied,"
208,CANTO I,"“As you might think.  The fact is,"
209,CANTO I,"In caverns by the water-side,"
210,CANTO I,"And other places that I’ve tried,"
211,CANTO I,I’ve had a lot of practice:
212,CANTO I,
213,CANTO I,“But I have never taken yet
214,CANTO I,"A strict domestic part,"
215,CANTO I,And in my flurry I forget
216,CANTO I,The Five Good Rules of Etiquette
217,CANTO I,We have to know by heart.”
218,CANTO I,
219,CANTO I,My sympathies were warming fast
220,CANTO I,Towards the little fellow:
221,CANTO I,He was so utterly aghast
222,CANTO I,"At having found a Man at last,"
223,CANTO I,And looked so scared and yellow.
224,CANTO I,
225,CANTO I,[Picture: In caverns by the water-side]
226,CANTO I,
227,CANTO I,"“At least,” I said, “I’m glad to find"
228,CANTO I,A Ghost is not a _dumb_ thing!
229,CANTO I,But pray sit down: you’ll feel inclined
230,CANTO I,"(If, like myself, you have not dined)"
231,CANTO I,To take a snack of something:
232,CANTO I,
233,CANTO I,"“Though, certainly, you don’t appear"
234,CANTO I,A thing to offer _food_ to!
235,CANTO I,And then I shall be glad to hear—
236,CANTO I,If you will say them loud and clear—
237,CANTO I,The Rules that you allude to.”
238,CANTO I,
239,CANTO I,“Thanks!  You shall hear them by and by.
240,CANTO I,This _is_ a piece of luck!”
241,CANTO I,“What may I offer you?” said I.
242,CANTO I,"“Well, since you _are_ so kind, I’ll try"
243,CANTO I,A little bit of duck.
244,CANTO I,
245,CANTO I,“_One_ slice!  And may I ask you for
246,CANTO I,Another drop of gravy?”
247,CANTO I,"I sat and looked at him in awe,"
248,CANTO I,For certainly I never saw
249,CANTO I,A thing so white and wavy.
250,CANTO I,
251,CANTO I,"And still he seemed to grow more white,"
252,CANTO I,"More vapoury, and wavier—"
253,CANTO I,"Seen in the dim and flickering light,"
254,CANTO I,As he proceeded to recite
255,CANTO I,His “Maxims of Behaviour.”
256,CANTO I,
257,CANTO I,[Picture: The Phantom dines]
258,CANTO I,
259,CANTO I,

261,CANTO II,CANTO II
262,CANTO II,Hys Fyve Rules
263,CANTO II,
264,CANTO II,
265,CANTO II,"“MY First—but don’t suppose,” he said,"
266,CANTO II,“I’m setting you a riddle—
267,CANTO II,"Is—if your Victim be in bed,"
268,CANTO II,"Don’t touch the curtains at his head,"
269,CANTO II,"But take them in the middle,"
270,CANTO II,
271,CANTO II,"“And wave them slowly in and out,"
272,CANTO II,While drawing them asunder;
273,CANTO II,"And in a minute’s time, no doubt,"
274,CANTO II,He’ll raise his head and look about
275,CANTO II,With eyes of wrath and wonder.
276,CANTO II,
277,CANTO II,“And here you must on no pretence
278,CANTO II,Make the first observation.
279,CANTO II,Wait for the Victim to commence:
280,CANTO II,No Ghost of any common sense
281,CANTO II,Begins a conversation.
282,CANTO II,
283,CANTO II,[Picture: Ghostly border] “If he should say ‘_How came you here_?’
284,CANTO II,"(The way that _you_ began, Sir,)"
285,CANTO II,In such a case your course is clear—
286,CANTO II,"‘_On the bat’s back_, _my little dear_!’"
287,CANTO II,Is the appropriate answer.
288,CANTO II,
289,CANTO II,"“If after this he says no more,"
290,CANTO II,You’d best perhaps curtail your
291,CANTO II,"Exertions—go and shake the door,"
292,CANTO II,"And then, if he begins to snore,"
293,CANTO II,You’ll know the thing’s a failure.
294,CANTO II,
295,CANTO II,"“By day, if he should be alone—"
296,CANTO II,At home or on a walk—
297,CANTO II,"You merely give a hollow groan,"
298,CANTO II,To indicate the kind of tone
299,CANTO II,In which you mean to talk.
300,CANTO II,
301,CANTO II,"“But if you find him with his friends,"
302,CANTO II,The thing is rather harder.
303,CANTO II,In such a case success depends
304,CANTO II,"On picking up some candle-ends,"
305,CANTO II,"Or butter, in the larder."
306,CANTO II,
307,CANTO II,“With this you make a kind of slide
308,CANTO II,"(It answers best with suet),"
309,CANTO II,"On which you must contrive to glide,"
310,CANTO II,And swing yourself from side to side—
311,CANTO II,One soon learns how to do it.
312,CANTO II,
313,CANTO II,[Picture: And swing yourself from side to side]
314,CANTO II,
315,CANTO II,“The Second tells us what is right
316,CANTO II,In ceremonious calls:—
317,CANTO II,‘_First burn a blue or crimson light_’
318,CANTO II,"(A thing I quite forgot to-night),"
319,CANTO II,‘_Then scratch the door or walls_.’”
320,CANTO II,
321,CANTO II,"I said “You’ll visit _here_ no more,"
322,CANTO II,If you attempt the Guy.
323,CANTO II,I’ll have no bonfires on _my_ floor—
324,CANTO II,"And, as for scratching at the door,"
325,CANTO II,I’d like to see you try!”
326,CANTO II,
327,CANTO II,“The Third was written to protect
328,CANTO II,"The interests of the Victim,"
329,CANTO II,"And tells us, as I recollect,"
330,CANTO II,"_To treat him with a grave respect_,"
331,CANTO II,_And not to contradict him_.”
332,CANTO II,
333,CANTO II,"“That’s plain,” said I, “as Tare and Tret,"
334,CANTO II,To any comprehension:
335,CANTO II,I only wish _some_ Ghosts I’ve met
336,CANTO II,Would not so _constantly_ forget
337,CANTO II,The maxim that you mention!”
338,CANTO II,
339,CANTO II,"“Perhaps,” he said, “_you_ first transgressed"
340,CANTO II,The laws of hospitality:
341,CANTO II,All Ghosts instinctively detest
342,CANTO II,The Man that fails to treat his guest
343,CANTO II,With proper cordiality.
344,CANTO II,
345,CANTO II,[Picture: And then you’re sure to catch it . . .]
346,CANTO II,
347,CANTO II,“If you address a Ghost as ‘Thing!’
348,CANTO II,"Or strike him with a hatchet,"
349,CANTO II,He is permitted by the King
350,CANTO II,To drop all _formal_ parleying—
351,CANTO II,And then you’re _sure_ to catch it!
352,CANTO II,
353,CANTO II,“The Fourth prohibits trespassing
354,CANTO II,Where other Ghosts are quartered:
355,CANTO II,And those convicted of the thing
356,CANTO II,(Unless when pardoned by the King)
357,CANTO II,Must instantly be slaughtered.
358,CANTO II,
359,CANTO II,“That simply means ‘be cut up small’:
360,CANTO II,Ghosts soon unite anew.
361,CANTO II,The process scarcely hurts at all—
362,CANTO II,Not more than when _you_ ’re what you call
363,CANTO II,‘Cut up’ by a Review.
364,CANTO II,
365,CANTO II,“The Fifth is one you may prefer
366,CANTO II,That I should quote entire:—
367,CANTO II,_The King must be addressed as_ ‘_Sir_.’
368,CANTO II,"_This_, _from a simple courtier_,"
369,CANTO II,_Is all the Laws require_:
370,CANTO II,
371,CANTO II,"“_But_, _should you wish to do the thing_"
372,CANTO II,"_With out-and-out politeness_,"
373,CANTO II,_Accost him as_ ‘_My Goblin King_!
374,CANTO II,"_And always use_, _in answering_,"
375,CANTO II,_The phrase_ ‘_Your Royal Whiteness_!’
376,CANTO II,
377,CANTO II,"“I’m getting rather hoarse, I fear,"
378,CANTO II,After so much reciting:
379,CANTO II,"So, if you don’t object, my dear,"
380,CANTO II,We’ll try a glass of bitter beer—
381,CANTO II,I think it looks inviting.”
382,CANTO II,

390,CANTO III,
391,CANTO III,"“AND did you really walk,” said I,"
392,CANTO III,“On such a wretched night?
393,CANTO III,I always fancied Ghosts could fly—
394,CANTO III,"If not exactly in the sky,"
395,CANTO III,Yet at a fairish height.”
396,CANTO III,
397,CANTO III,"“It’s very well,” said he, “for Kings"
398,CANTO III,To soar above the earth:
399,CANTO III,But Phantoms often find that wings—
400,CANTO III,Like many other pleasant things—
401,CANTO III,Cost more than they are worth.
402,CANTO III,
403,CANTO III,"“Spectres of course are rich, and so"
404,CANTO III,Can buy them from the Elves:
405,CANTO III,But _we_ prefer to keep below—
406,CANTO III,"They’re stupid company, you know,"
407,CANTO III,For any but themselves:
408,CANTO III,
409,CANTO III,"“For, though they claim to be exempt"
410,CANTO III,"From pride, they treat a Phantom"
411,CANTO III,As something quite beneath contempt—
412,CANTO III,Just as no Turkey ever dreamt
413,CANTO III,Of noticing a Bantam.”
414,CANTO III,
415,CANTO III,[Picture: The phantom]
416,CANTO III,
417,CANTO III,"“They seem too proud,” said I, “to go"
418,CANTO III,To houses such as mine.

423,CANTO III,“Inspector Kobold came to you—”
424,CANTO III,The little Ghost began.
425,CANTO III,Here I broke in—“Inspector who?
426,CANTO III,Inspecting Ghosts is something new!
427,CANTO III,"Explain yourself, my man!”"
428,CANTO III,
429,CANTO III,"“His name is Kobold,” said my guest:"
430,CANTO III,“One of the Spectre order:
431,CANTO III,You’ll very often see him dressed
432,CANTO III,"In a yellow gown, a crimson vest,"
433,CANTO III,And a night-cap with a border.
434,CANTO III,
435,CANTO III,"“He tried the Brocken business first,"
436,CANTO III,But caught a sort of chill;
437,CANTO III,"So came to England to be nursed,"
438,CANTO III,"And here it took the form of _thirst_,"
439,CANTO III,Which he complains of still.
440,CANTO III,
441,CANTO III,[Picture: And here it took the form of thirst]
442,CANTO III,
443,CANTO III,"“Port-wine, he says, when rich and sound,"
444,CANTO III,Warms his old bones like nectar:
445,CANTO III,"And as the inns, where it is found,"
446,CANTO III,"Are his especial hunting-ground,"
447,CANTO III,We call him the _Inn-Spectre_.”
448,CANTO III,
449,CANTO III,I bore it—bore it like a man—
450,CANTO III,This agonizing witticism!
451,CANTO III,And nothing could be sweeter than
452,CANTO III,"My temper, till the Ghost began"
453,CANTO III,Some most provoking criticism.
454,CANTO III,
455,CANTO III,“Cooks need not be indulged in waste;
456,CANTO III,Yet still you’d better teach them
457,CANTO III,Dishes should have _some sort_ of taste.

459,CANTO III,Where nobody can reach them?
460,CANTO III,
461,CANTO III,“That man of yours will never earn
462,CANTO III,His living as a waiter!

470,CANTO III,"The _next_ time you have toasted cheese,"
471,CANTO III,Don’t let them send it cold.
472,CANTO III,
473,CANTO III,"“You’d find the bread improved, I think,"
474,CANTO III,By getting better flour:
475,CANTO III,And have you anything to drink
476,CANTO III,"That looks a _little_ less like ink,"
477,CANTO III,And isn’t _quite_ so sour?”
478,CANTO III,
479,CANTO III,"Then, peering round with curious eyes,"
480,CANTO III,He muttered “Goodness gracious!”

506,CANTO III,(Taking a bottle in his hand)
507,CANTO III,“I’ll soon arrange for _that_!”
508,CANTO III,
509,CANTO III,"And here he took a careful aim,"
510,CANTO III,And gaily cried “Here goes!”
511,CANTO III,"I tried to dodge it as it came,"
512,CANTO III,"But somehow caught it, all the same,"
513,CANTO III,Exactly on my nose.
514,CANTO III,
515,CANTO III,And I remember nothing more

883,CANTO VI,That crowns the upward track.
884,CANTO VI,"And, entering with unsteady pace,"
885,CANTO VI,Receives a buffet in the face
886,CANTO VI,That lands him on his back:
887,CANTO VI,
888,CANTO VI,"[Picture: Decorative border of man climbing hall] And feels himself,"
889,CANTO VI,"like one in sleep,"
890,CANTO VI,"Glide swiftly down again,"
891,CANTO VI,"A helpless weight, from steep to steep,"
892,CANTO VI,"Till, with a headlong giddy sweep,"
893,CANTO VI,He drops upon the plain—
894,CANTO VI,
895,CANTO VI,"So I, that had resolved to bring"
896,CANTO VI,"Conviction to a ghost,"
897,CANTO VI,And found it quite a different thing
898,CANTO VI,"From any human arguing,"
899,CANTO VI,Yet dared not quit my post
900,CANTO VI,
901,CANTO VI,"But, keeping still the end in view"
902,CANTO VI,"To which I hoped to come,"
903,CANTO VI,I strove to prove the matter true
904,CANTO VI,By putting everything I knew
905,CANTO VI,Into an axiom:
906,CANTO VI,
907,CANTO VI,Commencing every single phrase
908,CANTO VI,"With ‘therefore’ or ‘because,’"
909,CANTO VI,"I blindly reeled, a hundred ways,"
910,CANTO VI,"About the syllogistic maze,"
911,CANTO VI,Unconscious where I was.
912,CANTO VI,
913,CANTO VI,Quoth he “That’s regular clap-trap:
914,CANTO VI,Don’t bluster any more.
915,CANTO VI,Now _do_ be cool and take a nap!
916,CANTO VI,Such a ridiculous old chap
917,CANTO VI,Was never seen before!
918,CANTO VI,
919,CANTO VI,"“You’re like a man I used to meet,"
920,CANTO VI,Who got one day so furious
921,CANTO VI,"In arguing, the simple heat"
922,CANTO VI,Scorched both his slippers off his feet!”
923,CANTO VI,I said “_That’s very curious_!”
924,CANTO VI,
925,CANTO VI,[Picture: Scorched both his slippers off his feet]
926,CANTO VI,
927,CANTO VI,"“Well, it _is_ curious, I agree,"
928,CANTO VI,And sounds perhaps like fibs:
929,CANTO VI,But still it’s true as true can be—
930,CANTO VI,"As sure as your name’s Tibbs,” said he."
931,CANTO VI,I said “My name’s _not_ Tibbs.”
932,CANTO VI,
933,CANTO VI,“_Not_ Tibbs!” he cried—his tone became
934,CANTO VI,A shade or two less hearty—
935,CANTO VI,"“Why, no,” said I.  “My proper name"
936,CANTO VI,"Is Tibbets—”  “Tibbets?”  “Aye, the same.”"
937,CANTO VI,"“Why, then YOU’RE NOT THE PARTY!”"
938,CANTO VI,
939,CANTO VI,With that he struck the board a blow
940,CANTO VI,That shivered half the glasses.
941,CANTO VI,“Why couldn’t you have told me so
942,CANTO VI,"Three quarters of an hour ago,"
943,CANTO VI,You prince of all the asses?
944,CANTO VI,
945,CANTO VI,"“To walk four miles through mud and rain,"
946,CANTO VI,"To spend the night in smoking,"
947,CANTO VI,And then to find that it’s in vain—
948,CANTO VI,And I’ve to do it all again—
949,CANTO VI,It’s really _too_ provoking!
950,CANTO VI,
951,CANTO VI,"“Don’t talk!” he cried, as I began"
952,CANTO VI,To mutter some excuse.
953,CANTO VI,“Who can have patience with a man
954,CANTO VI,That’s got no more discretion than
955,CANTO VI,An idiotic goose?
956,CANTO VI,
957,CANTO VI,[Picture: To walk four miles through mud and rain]
958,CANTO VI,
959,CANTO VI,"“To keep me waiting here, instead"
960,CANTO VI,Of telling me at once
961,CANTO VI,That this was not the house!” he said.
962,CANTO VI,"“There, that’ll do—be off to bed!"
963,CANTO VI,"Don’t gape like that, you dunce!”"
964,CANTO VI,
965,CANTO VI,“It’s very fine to throw the blame
966,CANTO VI,On _me_ in such a fashion!
967,CANTO VI,Why didn’t you enquire my name
968,CANTO VI,The very minute that you came?”
969,CANTO VI,I answered in a passion.
970,CANTO VI,
971,CANTO VI,“Of course it worries you a bit
972,CANTO VI,To come so far on foot—
973,CANTO VI,But how was _I_ to blame for it?”
974,CANTO VI,"“Well, well!” said he.  “I must admit"
975,CANTO VI,That isn’t badly put.
976,CANTO VI,
977,CANTO VI,“And certainly you’ve given me
978,CANTO VI,The best of wine and victual—
979,CANTO VI,"Excuse my violence,” said he,"
980,CANTO VI,"“But accidents like this, you see,"
981,CANTO VI,They put one out a little.
982,CANTO VI,
983,CANTO VI,"“’Twas _my_ fault after all, I find—"
984,CANTO VI,"Shake hands, old Turnip-top!”"
985,CANTO VI,"The name was hardly to my mind,"
986,CANTO VI,"But, as no doubt he meant it kind,"
987,CANTO VI,I let the matter drop.
988,CANTO VI,
989,CANTO VI,"“Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night!"
990,CANTO VI,"When I am gone, perhaps"
991,CANTO VI,"They’ll send you some inferior Sprite,"
992,CANTO VI,Who’ll keep you in a constant fright
993,CANTO VI,And spoil your soundest naps.
994,CANTO VI,
995,CANTO VI,“Tell him you’ll stand no sort of trick;
996,CANTO VI,"Then, if he leers and chuckles,"
997,CANTO VI,You just be handy with a stick
998,CANTO VI,(Mind that it’s pretty hard and thick)
999,CANTO VI,And rap him on the knuckles!
1000,CANTO VI,
1001,CANTO VI,“Then carelessly remark ‘Old coon!
1002,CANTO VI,Perhaps you’re not aware
1003,CANTO VI,"That, if you don’t behave, you’ll soon"
1004,CANTO VI,Be chuckling to another tune—
1005,CANTO VI,And so you’d best take care!’
1006,CANTO VI,
1007,CANTO VI,“That’s the right way to cure a Sprite
1008,CANTO VI,Of such like goings-on—
1009,CANTO VI,But gracious me!  It’s getting light!
1010,CANTO VI,"Good-night, old Turnip-top, good-night!”"

1025,CANTO VII,But soon a gentler feeling crept
1026,CANTO VII,"Upon me, and I sat and wept"
1027,CANTO VII,"An hour or so, like winking."
1028,CANTO VII,
1029,CANTO VII,“No need for Bones to hurry so!”
1030,CANTO VII,"I sobbed.  “In fact, I doubt"
1031,CANTO VII,If it was worth his while to go—
1032,CANTO VII,"And who is Tibbs, I’d like to know,"
1033,CANTO VII,To make such work about?
1034,CANTO VII,
1035,CANTO VII,"“If Tibbs is anything like me,"

1038,CANTO VII,"Dropped in upon at half-past three,"
1039,CANTO VII,After he’s snug in bed.
1040,CANTO VII,
1041,CANTO VII,“And if Bones plagues him anyhow—
1042,CANTO VII,"Squeaking and all the rest of it,"
1043,CANTO VII,As he was doing here just now—
1044,CANTO VII,"_I_ prophesy there’ll be a row,"

1046,CANTO VII,

1048,CANTO VII,
1049,CANTO VII,"Then, as my tears could never bring"
1050,CANTO VII,"The friendly Phantom back,"
1051,CANTO VII,It seemed to me the proper thing
1052,CANTO VII,"To mix another glass, and sing"
1053,CANTO VII,The following Coronach.
1054,CANTO VII,
1055,CANTO VII,"‘_And art thou gone_, _beloved Ghost_?"
1056,CANTO VII,_Best of Familiars_!

1066,CANTO VII,
1067,CANTO VII,"Instead of singing Verse the Third,"
1068,CANTO VII,"I ceased—abruptly, rather:"
1069,CANTO VII,"But, after such a splendid word"
1070,CANTO VII,I felt that it would be absurd
1071,CANTO VII,To try it any farther.
1072,CANTO VII,
1073,CANTO VII,So with a yawn I went my way
1074,CANTO VII,"To seek the welcome downy,"
1075,CANTO VII,"And slept, and dreamed till break of day"

1292,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Centered in the golden breast-pin.
1293,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,He had learnt it all from Ruskin
1294,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"(Author of ‘The Stones of Venice,’"
1295,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"‘Seven Lamps of Architecture,’"
1296,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"‘Modern Painters,’ and some others);"
1297,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,And perhaps he had not fully
1298,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Understood his author’s meaning;
1299,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"But, whatever was the reason,"
1300,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"All was fruitless, as the picture"
1301,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Ended in an utter failure.
1302,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,
1303,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,[Picture: Next to him the eldest daughter]
1304,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,
1305,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Next to him the eldest daughter:
1306,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"She suggested very little,"
1307,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Only asked if he would take her
1308,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,With her look of ‘passive beauty.’
1309,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Her idea of passive beauty
1310,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Was a squinting of the left-eye,"
1311,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Was a drooping of the right-eye,"
1312,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Was a smile that went up sideways
1313,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,To the corner of the nostrils.
1314,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Hiawatha, when she asked him,"
1315,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Took no notice of the question,"
1316,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Looked as if he hadn’t heard it;
1317,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"But, when pointedly appealed to,"
1318,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Smiled in his peculiar manner,"
1319,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Coughed and said it ‘didn’t matter,’"
1320,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Bit his lip and changed the subject.
1321,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Nor in this was he mistaken,"
1322,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,As the picture failed completely.
1323,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,So in turn the other sisters.
1324,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,
1325,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"[Picture: Last, the youngest son was taken]"
1326,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,
1327,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Last, the youngest son was taken:"
1328,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Very rough and thick his hair was,"
1329,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Very round and red his face was,"
1330,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Very dusty was his jacket,"
1331,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Very fidgety his manner.
1332,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,And his overbearing sisters
1333,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Called him names he disapproved of:
1334,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Called him Johnny, ‘Daddy’s Darling,’"
1335,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Called him Jacky, ‘Scrubby School-boy.’"
1336,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"And, so awful was the picture,"
1337,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,In comparison the others
1338,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Seemed, to one’s bewildered fancy,"
1339,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,To have partially succeeded.
1340,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Finally my Hiawatha
1341,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Tumbled all the tribe together,"
1342,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"(‘Grouped’ is not the right expression),"
1343,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"And, as happy chance would have it"
1344,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Did at last obtain a picture
1345,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Where the faces all succeeded:
1346,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Each came out a perfect likeness.
1347,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Then they joined and all abused it,"
1348,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Unrestrainedly abused it,"
1349,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,As the worst and ugliest picture
1350,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,They could possibly have dreamed of.
1351,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,‘Giving one such strange expressions—
1352,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Sullen, stupid, pert expressions."
1353,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Really any one would take us
1354,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,(Any one that did not know us)
1355,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,For the most unpleasant people!’
1356,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"(Hiawatha seemed to think so,"
1357,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Seemed to think it not unlikely).
1358,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"All together rang their voices,"
1359,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Angry, loud, discordant voices,"
1360,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"As of dogs that howl in concert,"
1361,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,As of cats that wail in chorus.
1362,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"But my Hiawatha’s patience,"
1363,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"His politeness and his patience,"
1364,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Unaccountably had vanished,"
1365,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,And he left that happy party.
1366,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Neither did he leave them slowly,"
1367,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"With the calm deliberation,"
1368,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,The intense deliberation
1369,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Of a photographic artist:
1370,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"But he left them in a hurry,"
1371,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Left them in a mighty hurry,"
1372,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,"Stating that he would not stand it,"
1373,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Stating in emphatic language
1374,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,What he’d be before he’d stand it.
1375,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Hurriedly he packed his boxes:
1376,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Hurriedly the porter trundled
1377,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,On a barrow all his boxes:
1378,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Hurriedly he took his ticket:
1379,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Hurriedly the train received him:
1380,HIAWATHA’S PHOTOGRAPHING,Thus departed Hiawatha.

1388,MELANCHOLETTA,
1389,MELANCHOLETTA,
1390,MELANCHOLETTA,WITH saddest music all day long
1391,MELANCHOLETTA,She soothed her secret sorrow:
1392,MELANCHOLETTA,At night she sighed “I fear ’twas wrong
1393,MELANCHOLETTA,Such cheerful words to borrow.
1394,MELANCHOLETTA,"Dearest, a sweeter, sadder song"
1395,MELANCHOLETTA,I’ll sing to thee to-morrow.”
1396,MELANCHOLETTA,
1397,MELANCHOLETTA,"I thanked her, but I could not say"
1398,MELANCHOLETTA,That I was glad to hear it:
1399,MELANCHOLETTA,"I left the house at break of day,"
1400,MELANCHOLETTA,And did not venture near it
1401,MELANCHOLETTA,"Till time, I hoped, had worn away"
1402,MELANCHOLETTA,"Her grief, for nought could cheer it!"
1403,MELANCHOLETTA,
1404,MELANCHOLETTA,[Picture: At night she signed]
1405,MELANCHOLETTA,
1406,MELANCHOLETTA,My dismal sister!  Couldst thou know
1407,MELANCHOLETTA,The wretched home thou keepest!
1408,MELANCHOLETTA,"Thy brother, drowned in daily woe,"
1409,MELANCHOLETTA,Is thankful when thou sleepest;
1410,MELANCHOLETTA,"For if I laugh, however low,"
1411,MELANCHOLETTA,"When thou’rt awake, thou weepest!"
1412,MELANCHOLETTA,
1413,MELANCHOLETTA,I took my sister t’other day
1414,MELANCHOLETTA,(Excuse the slang expression)
1415,MELANCHOLETTA,To Sadler’s Wells to see the play
1416,MELANCHOLETTA,In hopes the new impression
1417,MELANCHOLETTA,"Might in her thoughts, from grave to gay"
1418,MELANCHOLETTA,Effect some slight digression.
1419,MELANCHOLETTA,
1420,MELANCHOLETTA,I asked three gay young dogs from town
1421,MELANCHOLETTA,"To join us in our folly,"
1422,MELANCHOLETTA,"Whose mirth, I thought, might serve to drown"
1423,MELANCHOLETTA,My sister’s melancholy:
1424,MELANCHOLETTA,"The lively Jones, the sportive Brown,"
1425,MELANCHOLETTA,And Robinson the jolly.
1426,MELANCHOLETTA,
1427,MELANCHOLETTA,The maid announced the meal in tones
1428,MELANCHOLETTA,"That I myself had taught her,"
1429,MELANCHOLETTA,Meant to allay my sister’s moans
1430,MELANCHOLETTA,Like oil on troubled water:
1431,MELANCHOLETTA,"I rushed to Jones, the lively Jones,"
1432,MELANCHOLETTA,And begged him to escort her.
1433,MELANCHOLETTA,
1434,MELANCHOLETTA,"Vainly he strove, with ready wit,"
1435,MELANCHOLETTA,To joke about the weather—
1436,MELANCHOLETTA,To ventilate the last ‘_on dit_’—
1437,MELANCHOLETTA,To quote the price of leather—
1438,MELANCHOLETTA,She groaned “Here I and Sorrow sit:
1439,MELANCHOLETTA,Let us lament together!”
1440,MELANCHOLETTA,
1441,MELANCHOLETTA,"I urged “You’re wasting time, you know:"
1442,MELANCHOLETTA,Delay will spoil the venison.”
1443,MELANCHOLETTA,“My heart is wasted with my woe!
1444,MELANCHOLETTA,"There is no rest—in Venice, on"
1445,MELANCHOLETTA,The Bridge of Sighs!” she quoted low
1446,MELANCHOLETTA,From Byron and from Tennyson.
1447,MELANCHOLETTA,
1448,MELANCHOLETTA,I need not tell of soup and fish
1449,MELANCHOLETTA,"In solemn silence swallowed,"
1450,MELANCHOLETTA,"The sobs that ushered in each dish,"
1451,MELANCHOLETTA,"And its departure followed,"
1452,MELANCHOLETTA,Nor yet my suicidal wish
1453,MELANCHOLETTA,To _be_ the cheese I hollowed.
1454,MELANCHOLETTA,
1455,MELANCHOLETTA,Some desperate attempts were made
1456,MELANCHOLETTA,To start a conversation;
1457,MELANCHOLETTA,"“Madam,” the sportive Brown essayed,"
1458,MELANCHOLETTA,"“Which kind of recreation,"
1459,MELANCHOLETTA,"Hunting or fishing, have you made"
1460,MELANCHOLETTA,Your special occupation?”
1461,MELANCHOLETTA,
1462,MELANCHOLETTA,"Her lips curved downwards instantly,"
1463,MELANCHOLETTA,As if of india-rubber.
1464,MELANCHOLETTA,"“Hounds _in full cry_ I like,” said she:"
1465,MELANCHOLETTA,(Oh how I longed to snub her!)
1466,MELANCHOLETTA,"“Of fish, a whale’s the one for me,"
1467,MELANCHOLETTA,_It is so full of blubber_!”
1468,MELANCHOLETTA,
1469,MELANCHOLETTA,The night’s performance was “King John.”
1470,MELANCHOLETTA,"“It’s dull,” she wept, “and so-so!”"
1471,MELANCHOLETTA,"Awhile I let her tears flow on,"
1472,MELANCHOLETTA,She said they soothed her woe so!
1473,MELANCHOLETTA,At length the curtain rose upon
1474,MELANCHOLETTA,‘Bombastes Furioso.’
1475,MELANCHOLETTA,
1476,MELANCHOLETTA,In vain we roared; in vain we tried
1477,MELANCHOLETTA,To rouse her into laughter:
1478,MELANCHOLETTA,Her pensive glances wandered wide
1479,MELANCHOLETTA,From orchestra to rafter—
1480,MELANCHOLETTA,"“_Tier upon tier_!” she said, and sighed;"
1481,MELANCHOLETTA,And silence followed after.

1552,THE THREE VOICES,"HE trilled a carol fresh and free,"
1553,THE THREE VOICES,He laughed aloud for very glee:
1554,THE THREE VOICES,There came a breeze from off the sea:
1555,THE THREE VOICES,
1556,THE THREE VOICES,[Picture: There came a breeze from off the sea]
1557,THE THREE VOICES,
1558,THE THREE VOICES,It passed athwart the glooming flat—
1559,THE THREE VOICES,It fanned his forehead as he sat—
1560,THE THREE VOICES,"It lightly bore away his hat,"
1561,THE THREE VOICES,
1562,THE THREE VOICES,All to the feet of one who stood
1563,THE THREE VOICES,"Like maid enchanted in a wood,"
1564,THE THREE VOICES,Frowning as darkly as she could.
1565,THE THREE VOICES,
1566,THE THREE VOICES,"With huge umbrella, lank and brown,"
1567,THE THREE VOICES,"Unerringly she pinned it down,"
1568,THE THREE VOICES,Right through the centre of the crown.
1569,THE THREE VOICES,
1570,THE THREE VOICES,"Then, with an aspect cold and grim,"
1571,THE THREE VOICES,"Regardless of its battered rim,"
1572,THE THREE VOICES,She took it up and gave it him.
1573,THE THREE VOICES,
1574,THE THREE VOICES,"A while like one in dreams he stood,"
1575,THE THREE VOICES,Then faltered forth his gratitude
1576,THE THREE VOICES,In words just short of being rude:
1577,THE THREE VOICES,
1578,THE THREE VOICES,"For it had lost its shape and shine,"
1579,THE THREE VOICES,"And it had cost him four-and-nine,"
1580,THE THREE VOICES,And he was going out to dine.
1581,THE THREE VOICES,
1582,THE THREE VOICES,[Picture: Unerringly she pinned it down]
1583,THE THREE VOICES,
1584,THE THREE VOICES,“To dine!” she sneered in acid tone.
1585,THE THREE VOICES,“To bend thy being to a bone
1586,THE THREE VOICES,Clothed in a radiance not its own!”
1587,THE THREE VOICES,
1588,THE THREE VOICES,The tear-drop trickled to his chin:
1589,THE THREE VOICES,There was a meaning in her grin
1590,THE THREE VOICES,That made him feel on fire within.

1592,THE THREE VOICES,"“Term it not ‘radiance,’” said he:"

1598,THE THREE VOICES,"Say ‘Men are Men, and Geese are Geese.’”"
1599,THE THREE VOICES,
1600,THE THREE VOICES,He moaned: he knew not what to say.
1601,THE THREE VOICES,The thought “That I could get away!”
1602,THE THREE VOICES,Strove with the thought “But I must stay.
1603,THE THREE VOICES,
1604,THE THREE VOICES,“To dine!” she shrieked in dragon-wrath.
1605,THE THREE VOICES,“To swallow wines all foam and froth!

1628,THE THREE VOICES,“We grant them—there is no escape—

1632,THE THREE VOICES,"“In all such theories,” said he,"

1639,THE THREE VOICES,
1640,THE THREE VOICES,"She felt that her defeat was plain,"
1641,THE THREE VOICES,Yet madly strove with might and main
1642,THE THREE VOICES,To get the upper hand again.
1643,THE THREE VOICES,
1644,THE THREE VOICES,"Fixing her eyes upon the beach,"
1645,THE THREE VOICES,"As though unconscious of his speech,"
1646,THE THREE VOICES,She said “Each gives to more than each.”
1647,THE THREE VOICES,
1648,THE THREE VOICES,He could not answer yea or nay:
1649,THE THREE VOICES,He faltered “Gifts may pass away.”
1650,THE THREE VOICES,Yet knew not what he meant to say.
1651,THE THREE VOICES,
1652,THE THREE VOICES,"“If that be so,” she straight replied,"
1653,THE THREE VOICES,“Each heart with each doth coincide.
1654,THE THREE VOICES,What boots it?  For the world is wide.”

1661,THE THREE VOICES,
1662,THE THREE VOICES,And darkly fell her answer dread
1663,THE THREE VOICES,"Upon his unresisting head,"
1664,THE THREE VOICES,Like half a hundredweight of lead.
1665,THE THREE VOICES,
1666,THE THREE VOICES,“The Good and Great must ever shun

1676,THE THREE VOICES,Moaned “This is harder than Bezique!”
1677,THE THREE VOICES,
1678,THE THREE VOICES,But when she asked him “Wherefore so?”
1679,THE THREE VOICES,"He felt his very whiskers glow,"

1686,THE THREE VOICES,His colour came and went again.
1687,THE THREE VOICES,
1688,THE THREE VOICES,"Pitying his obvious distress,"
1689,THE THREE VOICES,"Yet with a tinge of bitterness,"
1690,THE THREE VOICES,She said “The More exceeds the Less.”
1691,THE THREE VOICES,
1692,THE THREE VOICES,"“A truth of such undoubted weight,”"
1693,THE THREE VOICES,"He urged, “and so extreme in date,"
1694,THE THREE VOICES,It were superfluous to state.”
1695,THE THREE VOICES,
1696,THE THREE VOICES,"Roused into sudden passion, she"
1697,THE THREE VOICES,In tone of cold malignity:
1698,THE THREE VOICES,"“To others, yea: but not to thee.”"
1699,THE THREE VOICES,
1700,THE THREE VOICES,"But when she saw him quail and quake,"
1701,THE THREE VOICES,And when he urged “For pity’s sake!”
1702,THE THREE VOICES,Once more in gentle tones she spake.
1703,THE THREE VOICES,
1704,THE THREE VOICES,“Thought in the mind doth still abide
1705,THE THREE VOICES,"That is by Intellect supplied,"
1706,THE THREE VOICES,And within that Idea doth hide:
1707,THE THREE VOICES,
1708,THE THREE VOICES,"“And he, that yearns the truth to know,"
1709,THE THREE VOICES,"Still further inwardly may go,"
1710,THE THREE VOICES,And find Idea from Notion flow:
1711,THE THREE VOICES,
1712,THE THREE VOICES,"“And thus the chain, that sages sought,"
1713,THE THREE VOICES,"Is to a glorious circle wrought,"
1714,THE THREE VOICES,For Notion hath its source in Thought.”
1715,THE THREE VOICES,
1716,THE THREE VOICES,So passed they on with even pace:
1717,THE THREE VOICES,Yet gradually one might trace
1718,THE THREE VOICES,A shadow growing on his face.
1719,THE THREE VOICES,
1720,THE THREE VOICES,[Picture: A shadow growing on his face]
1721,THE THREE VOICES,

1724,THE THREE VOICES,The Second Voice
1725,THE THREE VOICES,
1726,THE THREE VOICES,
1727,THE THREE VOICES,[Picture: They walked beside the wave-worn beach]
1728,THE THREE VOICES,
1729,THE THREE VOICES,They walked beside the wave-worn beach;
1730,THE THREE VOICES,"Her tongue was very apt to teach,"
1731,THE THREE VOICES,And now and then he did beseech
1732,THE THREE VOICES,
1733,THE THREE VOICES,"She would abate her dulcet tone,"
1734,THE THREE VOICES,"Because the talk was all her own,"
1735,THE THREE VOICES,And he was dull as any drone.
1736,THE THREE VOICES,
1737,THE THREE VOICES,She urged “No cheese is made of chalk”:
1738,THE THREE VOICES,"And ceaseless flowed her dreary talk,"
1739,THE THREE VOICES,Tuned to the footfall of a walk.
1740,THE THREE VOICES,
1741,THE THREE VOICES,"Her voice was very full and rich,"
1742,THE THREE VOICES,"And, when at length she asked him “Which?”"
1743,THE THREE VOICES,It mounted to its highest pitch.
1744,THE THREE VOICES,
1745,THE THREE VOICES,"He a bewildered answer gave,"
1746,THE THREE VOICES,"Drowned in the sullen moaning wave,"
1747,THE THREE VOICES,Lost in the echoes of the cave.
1748,THE THREE VOICES,
1749,THE THREE VOICES,He answered her he knew not what:
1750,THE THREE VOICES,"Like shaft from bow at random shot,"
1751,THE THREE VOICES,"He spoke, but she regarded not."
1752,THE THREE VOICES,
1753,THE THREE VOICES,"She waited not for his reply,"
1754,THE THREE VOICES,But with a downward leaden eye
1755,THE THREE VOICES,Went on as if he were not by
1756,THE THREE VOICES,
1757,THE THREE VOICES,"Sound argument and grave defence,"
1758,THE THREE VOICES,Strange questions raised on “Why?” and “Whence?”
1759,THE THREE VOICES,And wildly tangled evidence.
1760,THE THREE VOICES,
1761,THE THREE VOICES,"When he, with racked and whirling brain,"
1762,THE THREE VOICES,"Feebly implored her to explain,"
1763,THE THREE VOICES,She simply said it all again.
1764,THE THREE VOICES,
1765,THE THREE VOICES,"Wrenched with an agony intense,"
1766,THE THREE VOICES,"He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense,"
1767,THE THREE VOICES,And careless of all consequence:
1768,THE THREE VOICES,
1769,THE THREE VOICES,“Mind—I believe—is Essence—Ent—
1770,THE THREE VOICES,Abstract—that is—an Accident—
1771,THE THREE VOICES,Which we—that is to say—I meant—”
1772,THE THREE VOICES,
1773,THE THREE VOICES,"When, with quick breath and cheeks all flushed,"
1774,THE THREE VOICES,"At length his speech was somewhat hushed,"
1775,THE THREE VOICES,"She looked at him, and he was crushed."
1776,THE THREE VOICES,
1777,THE THREE VOICES,It needed not her calm reply:
1778,THE THREE VOICES,"She fixed him with a stony eye,"
1779,THE THREE VOICES,And he could neither fight nor fly.
1780,THE THREE VOICES,
1781,THE THREE VOICES,"While she dissected, word by word,"
1782,THE THREE VOICES,"His speech, half guessed at and half heard,"
1783,THE THREE VOICES,As might a cat a little bird.
1784,THE THREE VOICES,
1785,THE THREE VOICES,"[Picture: He spake, neglecting Sound and Sense]"
1786,THE THREE VOICES,
1787,THE THREE VOICES,"Then, having wholly overthrown"
1788,THE THREE VOICES,"His views, and stripped them to the bone,"
1789,THE THREE VOICES,Proceeded to unfold her own.
1790,THE THREE VOICES,
1791,THE THREE VOICES,“Shall Man be Man?  And shall he miss
1792,THE THREE VOICES,"Of other thoughts no thought but this,"
1793,THE THREE VOICES,Harmonious dews of sober bliss?
1794,THE THREE VOICES,
1795,THE THREE VOICES,“What boots it?  Shall his fevered eye
1796,THE THREE VOICES,Through towering nothingness descry
1797,THE THREE VOICES,The grisly phantom hurry by?
1798,THE THREE VOICES,
1799,THE THREE VOICES,“And hear dumb shrieks that fill the air;
1800,THE THREE VOICES,"See mouths that gape, and eyes that stare"
1801,THE THREE VOICES,And redden in the dusky glare?
1802,THE THREE VOICES,
1803,THE THREE VOICES,"“The meadows breathing amber light,"
1804,THE THREE VOICES,"The darkness toppling from the height,"
1805,THE THREE VOICES,The feathery train of granite Night?
1806,THE THREE VOICES,
1807,THE THREE VOICES,"“Shall he, grown gray among his peers,"
1808,THE THREE VOICES,Through the thick curtain of his tears
1809,THE THREE VOICES,"Catch glimpses of his earlier years,"
1810,THE THREE VOICES,
1811,THE THREE VOICES,[Picture: Shall Man be Man?]
1812,THE THREE VOICES,
1813,THE THREE VOICES,"“And hear the sounds he knew of yore,"
1814,THE THREE VOICES,"Old shufflings on the sanded floor,"
1815,THE THREE VOICES,Old knuckles tapping at the door?
1816,THE THREE VOICES,
1817,THE THREE VOICES,“Yet still before him as he flies
1818,THE THREE VOICES,"One pallid form shall ever rise,"
1819,THE THREE VOICES,"And, bodying forth in glassy eyes"
1820,THE THREE VOICES,
1821,THE THREE VOICES,"“The vision of a vanished good,"
1822,THE THREE VOICES,"Low peering through the tangled wood,"
1823,THE THREE VOICES,Shall freeze the current of his blood.”
1824,THE THREE VOICES,
1825,THE THREE VOICES,"Still from each fact, with skill uncouth"
1826,THE THREE VOICES,"And savage rapture, like a tooth"
1827,THE THREE VOICES,She wrenched some slow reluctant truth.
1828,THE THREE VOICES,
1829,THE THREE VOICES,"Till, like a silent water-mill,"
1830,THE THREE VOICES,"When summer suns have dried the rill,"
1831,THE THREE VOICES,"She reached a full stop, and was still."
1832,THE THREE VOICES,
1833,THE THREE VOICES,"Dead calm succeeded to the fuss,"
1834,THE THREE VOICES,As when the loaded omnibus
1835,THE THREE VOICES,Has reached the railway terminus:
1836,THE THREE VOICES,
1837,THE THREE VOICES,"When, for the tumult of the street,"
1838,THE THREE VOICES,"Is heard the engine’s stifled beat,"
1839,THE THREE VOICES,The velvet tread of porters’ feet.
1840,THE THREE VOICES,
1841,THE THREE VOICES,"With glance that ever sought the ground,"
1842,THE THREE VOICES,"She moved her lips without a sound,"
1843,THE THREE VOICES,And every now and then she frowned.
1844,THE THREE VOICES,
1845,THE THREE VOICES,"He gazed upon the sleeping sea,"
1846,THE THREE VOICES,"And joyed in its tranquillity,"
1847,THE THREE VOICES,"And in that silence dead, but she"
1848,THE THREE VOICES,
1849,THE THREE VOICES,"To muse a little space did seem,"
1850,THE THREE VOICES,"Then, like the echo of a dream,"
1851,THE THREE VOICES,Harked back upon her threadbare theme.
1852,THE THREE VOICES,
1853,THE THREE VOICES,Still an attentive ear he lent
1854,THE THREE VOICES,But could not fathom what she meant:
1855,THE THREE VOICES,"She was not deep, nor eloquent."
1856,THE THREE VOICES,
1857,THE THREE VOICES,He marked the ripple on the sand:
1858,THE THREE VOICES,The even swaying of her hand
1859,THE THREE VOICES,Was all that he could understand.
1860,THE THREE VOICES,
1861,THE THREE VOICES,"He saw in dreams a drawing-room,"
1862,THE THREE VOICES,"Where thirteen wretches sat in gloom,"
1863,THE THREE VOICES,Waiting—he thought he knew for whom:
1864,THE THREE VOICES,
1865,THE THREE VOICES,"He saw them drooping here and there,"
1866,THE THREE VOICES,"Each feebly huddled on a chair,"
1867,THE THREE VOICES,In attitudes of blank despair:
1868,THE THREE VOICES,
1869,THE THREE VOICES,"Oysters were not more mute than they,"
1870,THE THREE VOICES,"For all their brains were pumped away,"
1871,THE THREE VOICES,And they had nothing more to say—
1872,THE THREE VOICES,
1873,THE THREE VOICES,"Save one, who groaned “Three hours are gone!”"
1874,THE THREE VOICES,"Who shrieked “We’ll wait no longer, John!"
1875,THE THREE VOICES,Tell them to set the dinner on!”
1876,THE THREE VOICES,
1877,THE THREE VOICES,The vision passed: the ghosts were fled:
1878,THE THREE VOICES,He saw once more that woman dread:
1879,THE THREE VOICES,He heard once more the words she said.
1880,THE THREE VOICES,
1881,THE THREE VOICES,"He left her, and he turned aside:"
1882,THE THREE VOICES,He sat and watched the coming tide
1883,THE THREE VOICES,Across the shores so newly dried.
1884,THE THREE VOICES,
1885,THE THREE VOICES,[Picture: He sat and watched the coming tide]
1886,THE THREE VOICES,
1887,THE THREE VOICES,"He wondered at the waters clear,"
1888,THE THREE VOICES,"The breeze that whispered in his ear,"
1889,THE THREE VOICES,"The billows heaving far and near,"
1890,THE THREE VOICES,
1891,THE THREE VOICES,And why he had so long preferred
1892,THE THREE VOICES,To hang upon her every word:
1893,THE THREE VOICES,"“In truth,” he said, “it was absurd.”"
1894,THE THREE VOICES,
1895,THE THREE VOICES,[Picture: He sits]

1903,THE THREE VOICES,
1904,THE THREE VOICES,Not long this transport held its place:
1905,THE THREE VOICES,Within a little moment’s space
1906,THE THREE VOICES,Quick tears were raining down his face
1907,THE THREE VOICES,
1908,THE THREE VOICES,"His heart stood still, aghast with fear;"
1909,THE THREE VOICES,"A wordless voice, nor far nor near,"
1910,THE THREE VOICES,He seemed to hear and not to hear.
1911,THE THREE VOICES,
1912,THE THREE VOICES,“Tears kindle not the doubtful spark.
1913,THE THREE VOICES,"If so, why not?  Of this remark"
1914,THE THREE VOICES,The bearings are profoundly dark.”
1915,THE THREE VOICES,
1916,THE THREE VOICES,"“Her speech,” he said, “hath caused this pain."
1917,THE THREE VOICES,Easier I count it to explain
1918,THE THREE VOICES,"The jargon of the howling main,"
1919,THE THREE VOICES,
1920,THE THREE VOICES,"“Or, stretched beside some babbling brook,"
1921,THE THREE VOICES,"To con, with inexpressive look,"
1922,THE THREE VOICES,An unintelligible book.”
1923,THE THREE VOICES,
1924,THE THREE VOICES,"Low spake the voice within his head,"
1925,THE THREE VOICES,"In words imagined more than said,"
1926,THE THREE VOICES,Soundless as ghost’s intended tread:
1927,THE THREE VOICES,
1928,THE THREE VOICES,"“If thou art duller than before,"
1929,THE THREE VOICES,Why quittedst thou the voice of lore?
1930,THE THREE VOICES,"Why not endure, expecting more?”"
1931,THE THREE VOICES,
1932,THE THREE VOICES,"“Rather than that,” he groaned aghast,"
1933,THE THREE VOICES,"“I’d writhe in depths of cavern vast,"
1934,THE THREE VOICES,Some loathly vampire’s rich repast.”
1935,THE THREE VOICES,
1936,THE THREE VOICES,[Picture: He groaned aghast]
1937,THE THREE VOICES,
1938,THE THREE VOICES,"“’Twere hard,” it answered, “themes immense"
1939,THE THREE VOICES,To coop within the narrow fence
1940,THE THREE VOICES,That rings _thy_ scant intelligence.”
1941,THE THREE VOICES,
1942,THE THREE VOICES,"“Not so,” he urged, “nor once alone:"
1943,THE THREE VOICES,But there was something in her tone
1944,THE THREE VOICES,That chilled me to the very bone.
1945,THE THREE VOICES,
1946,THE THREE VOICES,"“Her style was anything but clear,"
1947,THE THREE VOICES,And most unpleasantly severe;
1948,THE THREE VOICES,Her epithets were very queer.
1949,THE THREE VOICES,
1950,THE THREE VOICES,"“And yet, so grand were her replies,"
1951,THE THREE VOICES,I could not choose but deem her wise;
1952,THE THREE VOICES,I did not dare to criticise;
1953,THE THREE VOICES,
1954,THE THREE VOICES,"“Nor did I leave her, till she went"
1955,THE THREE VOICES,So deep in tangled argument
1956,THE THREE VOICES,That all my powers of thought were spent.”
1957,THE THREE VOICES,
1958,THE THREE VOICES,"A little whisper inly slid,"
1959,THE THREE VOICES,“Yet truth is truth: you know you did.”
1960,THE THREE VOICES,A little wink beneath the lid.
1961,THE THREE VOICES,
1962,THE THREE VOICES,"And, sickened with excess of dread,"
1963,THE THREE VOICES,"Prone to the dust he bent his head,"
1964,THE THREE VOICES,And lay like one three-quarters dead
1965,THE THREE VOICES,
1966,THE THREE VOICES,The whisper left him—like a breeze
1967,THE THREE VOICES,Lost in the depths of leafy trees—
1968,THE THREE VOICES,Left him by no means at his ease.
1969,THE THREE VOICES,
1970,THE THREE VOICES,"Once more he weltered in despair,"
1971,THE THREE VOICES,"With hands, through denser-matted hair,"
1972,THE THREE VOICES,More tightly clenched than then they were.
1973,THE THREE VOICES,
1974,THE THREE VOICES,"When, bathed in Dawn of living red,"
1975,THE THREE VOICES,"Majestic frowned the mountain head,"
1976,THE THREE VOICES,"“Tell me my fault,” was all he said."
1977,THE THREE VOICES,
1978,THE THREE VOICES,"When, at high Noon, the blazing sky"
1979,THE THREE VOICES,"Scorched in his head each haggard eye,"
1980,THE THREE VOICES,Then keenest rose his weary cry.
1981,THE THREE VOICES,
1982,THE THREE VOICES,And when at Eve the unpitying sun
1983,THE THREE VOICES,"Smiled grimly on the solemn fun,"
1984,THE THREE VOICES,"“Alack,” he sighed, “what _have_ I done?”"
1985,THE THREE VOICES,
1986,THE THREE VOICES,"[Picture: Tortured, unaided, and alone]"
1987,THE THREE VOICES,
1988,THE THREE VOICES,"But saddest, darkest was the sight,"
1989,THE THREE VOICES,When the cold grasp of leaden Night
1990,THE THREE VOICES,"Dashed him to earth, and held him tight."
1991,THE THREE VOICES,
1992,THE THREE VOICES,"Tortured, unaided, and alone,"
1993,THE THREE VOICES,"Thunders were silence to his groan,"
1994,THE THREE VOICES,Bagpipes sweet music to its tone:
1995,THE THREE VOICES,
1996,THE THREE VOICES,"“What?  Ever thus, in dismal round,"
1997,THE THREE VOICES,Shall Pain and Mystery profound
1998,THE THREE VOICES,"Pursue me like a sleepless hound,"
1999,THE THREE VOICES,
2000,THE THREE VOICES,"“With crimson-dashed and eager jaws,"
2001,THE THREE VOICES,"Me, still in ignorance of the cause,"
2002,THE THREE VOICES,Unknowing what I broke of laws?”
2003,THE THREE VOICES,
2004,THE THREE VOICES,The whisper to his ear did seem
2005,THE THREE VOICES,"Like echoed flow of silent stream,"
2006,THE THREE VOICES,"Or shadow of forgotten dream,"
2007,THE THREE VOICES,
2008,THE THREE VOICES,The whisper trembling in the wind:
2009,THE THREE VOICES,"“Her fate with thine was intertwined,”"
2010,THE THREE VOICES,So spake it in his inner mind:
