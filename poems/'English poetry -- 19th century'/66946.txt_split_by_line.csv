34,SUMMER MORNING.,SUMMER MORNING.
35,SUMMER MORNING.,
36,SUMMER MORNING.,
37,SUMMER MORNING.,"Morning again breaks through the mines of Heaven,"
38,SUMMER MORNING.,"And shakes her jewelled kirtle on the sky,"
39,SUMMER MORNING.,Heavy with rosy gold. Aside are driven
40,SUMMER MORNING.,"The vassal clouds, which bow as she draws nigh,"
41,SUMMER MORNING.,"And catch her scattered gems of orient dye,"
42,SUMMER MORNING.,The pearlèd-ruby which her pathway strews;
43,SUMMER MORNING.,"Argent and amber, now thrown useless by."
44,SUMMER MORNING.,"The uncoloured clouds wear what she doth refuse,"
45,SUMMER MORNING.,For only once does Morn her sun-dyed garments use.
46,SUMMER MORNING.,
47,SUMMER MORNING.,No print of sheep-track yet hath crushed a flower;
48,SUMMER MORNING.,The spider’s woof with silvery dew is hung
49,SUMMER MORNING.,As it was beaded ere the daylight hour:
50,SUMMER MORNING.,"The hookèd bramble just as it was strung,"
51,SUMMER MORNING.,"When on each leaf the Night her crystals flung,"
52,SUMMER MORNING.,"Then hurried off, the dawning to elude;"
53,SUMMER MORNING.,"Before the golden-beakèd blackbird sung,"
54,SUMMER MORNING.,"Or ere the yellow-brooms, or gorses rude,"
55,SUMMER MORNING.,Had bared their armèd heads in lowly gratitude.
56,SUMMER MORNING.,
57,SUMMER MORNING.,From Nature’s old cathedral sweetly ring
58,SUMMER MORNING.,"The wild-bird choirs--burst of the woodland band,"
59,SUMMER MORNING.,"Green-hooded nuns, who ’mid the blossoms sing;"
60,SUMMER MORNING.,"Their leafy temple, gloomy, tall, and grand,"
61,SUMMER MORNING.,"Pillared with oaks, and roofed with Heaven’s own hand."
62,SUMMER MORNING.,Hark! how the anthem rolls through arches dun:--
63,SUMMER MORNING.,“Morning again is come to light the land;
64,SUMMER MORNING.,"The great world’s Comforter, the mighty Sun,"
65,SUMMER MORNING.,"Has yoked his golden steeds, the glorious race to run.”"
66,SUMMER MORNING.,
67,SUMMER MORNING.,"Those dusky foragers, the noisy rooks,"
68,SUMMER MORNING.,"Have from their green high city-gates rushed out,"
69,SUMMER MORNING.,To rummage furrowy fields and flowery nooks;
70,SUMMER MORNING.,On yonder branch now stands their glossy scout.
71,SUMMER MORNING.,"As yet no busy insects buzz about,"
72,SUMMER MORNING.,No fairy thunder o’er the air is rolled:
73,SUMMER MORNING.,The drooping buds their crimson lips still pout;
74,SUMMER MORNING.,"Those stars of earth, the daisies white, unfold,"
75,SUMMER MORNING.,And soon the buttercups will give back “gold for gold.”
76,SUMMER MORNING.,
77,SUMMER MORNING.,“Hark! hark! the lark” sings ’mid the silvery blue;
78,SUMMER MORNING.,"Behold her flight, proud man! and lowly bow."
79,SUMMER MORNING.,"She seems the first that does for pardon sue,"
80,SUMMER MORNING.,As though the guilty stain which lurks below
81,SUMMER MORNING.,"Had touched the flowers that drooped above her brow,"
82,SUMMER MORNING.,When she all night slept by the daisies’ side;
83,SUMMER MORNING.,"And now she soars where purity doth flow,"
84,SUMMER MORNING.,"Where new-born light is with no sin allied,"
85,SUMMER MORNING.,And pointing with her wings Heaven-ward our thoughts would guide.
86,SUMMER MORNING.,
87,SUMMER MORNING.,In belted gold the bees with “merry march”
88,SUMMER MORNING.,Through flowery towns go sounding on their way:
89,SUMMER MORNING.,"They pass the streakèd woodbine’s sun-stained arch,"
90,SUMMER MORNING.,"And onward glide through streets of sheeted May,"
91,SUMMER MORNING.,"Nor till they reach the summer-roses stay,"
92,SUMMER MORNING.,"Where maiden-buds are wrapt in dewy dreams,"
93,SUMMER MORNING.,"Drowsy through breathing back the new-mown hay,"
94,SUMMER MORNING.,"That rolls its fragrance o’er the fringèd streams,--"
95,SUMMER MORNING.,Mirrors in which the Sun now decks his quivering beams.
96,SUMMER MORNING.,
97,SUMMER MORNING.,"Uprise the lambs, fresh from their flowery slumber,"
98,SUMMER MORNING.,(The daisies they pressed down rise from the sod;)--
99,SUMMER MORNING.,"He guardeth them who every star doth number,"
100,SUMMER MORNING.,"Who called His Son a lamb,--“the Lamb of God;”"
101,SUMMER MORNING.,"And for His sake withdrew th’ uplifted rod,"
102,SUMMER MORNING.,"Bidding each cloud turn to a silvery fleece,"
103,SUMMER MORNING.,The imaged flock for which our Shepherd trod
104,SUMMER MORNING.,"The paths of sorrow, that we might find peace:--"
105,SUMMER MORNING.,Those emblems of his love will wave till time shall cease.
106,SUMMER MORNING.,
107,SUMMER MORNING.,"On the far sky leans the old ruined mill,"
108,SUMMER MORNING.,"Through its rent sails the broken sunbeams glow,"
109,SUMMER MORNING.,"Gilding the trees that belt the lower hill,"
110,SUMMER MORNING.,And the old thorns which on its summit grow.
111,SUMMER MORNING.,"Only the reedy marsh that sleeps below,"
112,SUMMER MORNING.,"With its dwarf bushes, is concealed from view;"
113,SUMMER MORNING.,"And now a struggling thorn its head doth show,"
114,SUMMER MORNING.,"Another half shakes off the smoky blue,"
115,SUMMER MORNING.,Just where the dusty gold streams through the heavy dew:
116,SUMMER MORNING.,
117,SUMMER MORNING.,"And there the hidden river lingering dreams,"
118,SUMMER MORNING.,You scarce can see the banks which round it lie;
119,SUMMER MORNING.,"That withered trunk, a tree, or shepherd seems,"
120,SUMMER MORNING.,Just as the light or fancy strikes the eye.
121,SUMMER MORNING.,"Even the very sheep, which graze hard by,"
122,SUMMER MORNING.,"So blend their fleeces with the misty haze,"
123,SUMMER MORNING.,"They look like clouds shook from the unsunned sky,"
124,SUMMER MORNING.,Ere morning o’er the eastern hills did blaze:--
125,SUMMER MORNING.,The vision fades as they move further on to graze.
126,SUMMER MORNING.,
127,SUMMER MORNING.,"A chequered light streams in between the leaves,"
128,SUMMER MORNING.,Which on the greensward twinkle in the sun;
129,SUMMER MORNING.,"The deep-voiced thrush his speckled bosom heaves,"
130,SUMMER MORNING.,"And like a silver stream his song doth run,"
131,SUMMER MORNING.,"Down the low vale, edgèd with fir-trees dun."
132,SUMMER MORNING.,"A little bird now hops beside the brook,"
133,SUMMER MORNING.,“Peaking” about like an affrighted nun;
134,SUMMER MORNING.,"And ever as she drinks doth upward look,"
135,SUMMER MORNING.,"Twitters and drinks again, then seeks her cloistered nook."
136,SUMMER MORNING.,
137,SUMMER MORNING.,What varied colours o’er the landscape play!
138,SUMMER MORNING.,"The very clouds seem at their ease to lean,"
139,SUMMER MORNING.,And the whole earth to keep glad holiday.
140,SUMMER MORNING.,"The lowliest bush that by the waste is seen,"
141,SUMMER MORNING.,Hath changed its dusky for a golden green
142,SUMMER MORNING.,In honour of this lovely Summer Morn:
143,SUMMER MORNING.,"The rutted roads did never seem so clean,"
144,SUMMER MORNING.,"There is no dust upon the wayside thorn,"
145,SUMMER MORNING.,For every bud looks out as if but newly born.
146,SUMMER MORNING.,
147,SUMMER MORNING.,"A cottage girl trips by with side-long look,"
148,SUMMER MORNING.,Steadying the little basket on her head;
149,SUMMER MORNING.,And where a plank bridges the narrow brook
150,SUMMER MORNING.,"She stops, to see her fair form shadowèd."
151,SUMMER MORNING.,The stream reflects her cloak of russet red;
152,SUMMER MORNING.,"Below she sees the trees and deep-blue sky,"
153,SUMMER MORNING.,"The flowers which downward look in that clear bed,"
154,SUMMER MORNING.,The very birds which o’er its brightness fly:--
155,SUMMER MORNING.,"She parts her loose-blown hair, then wondering passes by."
156,SUMMER MORNING.,
157,SUMMER MORNING.,Now other forms move o’er the footpaths brown
158,SUMMER MORNING.,In twos and threes; for it is Market-day.
159,SUMMER MORNING.,"Beyond those hills stretches a little town,"
160,SUMMER MORNING.,"And thitherward the rustics bend their way,"
161,SUMMER MORNING.,"Crossing the scene in blue, and red, and grey;"
162,SUMMER MORNING.,"Now by green hedge-rows, now by oak-trees old,"
163,SUMMER MORNING.,As they by stile or thatchèd cottage stray.
164,SUMMER MORNING.,"Peep through the rounded hand, and you’ll behold"
165,SUMMER MORNING.,"Such gems as Morland drew, in frames of sunny gold."
166,SUMMER MORNING.,
167,SUMMER MORNING.,"A ladened ass, a maid with wicker maun’,"
168,SUMMER MORNING.,"A shepherd lad driving his lambs to sell,"
169,SUMMER MORNING.,"Gaudy-dressed girls move in the rosy dawn,"
170,SUMMER MORNING.,"Women whose cloaks become the landscape well,"
171,SUMMER MORNING.,Farmers whose thoughts on crops and prizes dwell;
172,SUMMER MORNING.,An old man with his cow and calf draws near.
173,SUMMER MORNING.,Anon you hear the Village Carrier’s bell;
174,SUMMER MORNING.,"Then does his grey old tilted cart appear,"
175,SUMMER MORNING.,"Moving so slow, you think he never will get there."
176,SUMMER MORNING.,
177,SUMMER MORNING.,"They come from still green nooks, woods old and hoary,"
178,SUMMER MORNING.,"The silent work of many a summer night,"
179,SUMMER MORNING.,"Ere those tall trees attained their giant glory,"
180,SUMMER MORNING.,Or their dark tops did tower that cloudy height:
181,SUMMER MORNING.,"They come from spots which the grey hawthorns light,"
182,SUMMER MORNING.,Where stream-kissed willows make a silvery shiver.
183,SUMMER MORNING.,For years their steps have worn those footpaths bright
184,SUMMER MORNING.,"Which wind along the fields and by the river,"
185,SUMMER MORNING.,"That makes a murmuring sound, a “ribble-bibble” ever."
186,SUMMER MORNING.,
187,SUMMER MORNING.,"A troop of soldiers pass with stately pace,--"
188,SUMMER MORNING.,Their early music wakes the village street:
189,SUMMER MORNING.,"Through yon white blinds peeps many a lovely face,"
190,SUMMER MORNING.,Smiling--perchance unconsciously how sweet!
191,SUMMER MORNING.,"One does the carpet press with blue-veined feet,"
192,SUMMER MORNING.,"Not thinking how her fair neck she exposes,"
193,SUMMER MORNING.,But with white foot timing the drum’s deep beat;
194,SUMMER MORNING.,"And, when again she on her pillow dozes,"
195,SUMMER MORNING.,Dreams how she’ll dance that tune ’mong Summer’s richest roses.
196,SUMMER MORNING.,
197,SUMMER MORNING.,"So let her dream, even as beauty should!"
198,SUMMER MORNING.,Let the white plumes athwart her slumbers sway!
199,SUMMER MORNING.,"Why should I steep their swaling snow in blood,"
200,SUMMER MORNING.,Or bid her think of battle’s grim array?
201,SUMMER MORNING.,"Truth will too soon her blinding star display,"
202,SUMMER MORNING.,And like a fearful comet meet her eyes.
203,SUMMER MORNING.,And yet how peaceful they pass on their way!
204,SUMMER MORNING.,How grand the sight as up the hill they rise!--
205,SUMMER MORNING.,I will not think of cities reddening in the skies.
206,SUMMER MORNING.,
207,SUMMER MORNING.,How sweet those rural sounds float by the hill!
208,SUMMER MORNING.,"The grasshopper’s shrill chirp rings o’er the ground,"
209,SUMMER MORNING.,"The jingling sheep-bells are but seldom still,"
210,SUMMER MORNING.,"The clapping gate closes with hollow bound,"
211,SUMMER MORNING.,There’s music in the church-clock’s measured sound.
212,SUMMER MORNING.,"The ring-dove’s song, how breeze-like comes and goes,"
213,SUMMER MORNING.,"Now here, now there, it seems to wander round:"
214,SUMMER MORNING.,The red cow’s voice along the upland flows;
215,SUMMER MORNING.,His bass the brindled bull from the far meadow lows.
216,SUMMER MORNING.,
217,SUMMER MORNING.,"“Cuckoo! cuckoo!” ah! well I know thy note,"
218,SUMMER MORNING.,"Those summer-sounds the backward years do bring,"
219,SUMMER MORNING.,Like Memory’s locked-up barque once more afloat:
220,SUMMER MORNING.,"They carry me away to life’s glad spring,"
221,SUMMER MORNING.,"To home, with all its old boughs rustleìng."
222,SUMMER MORNING.,’Tis a sweet sound! but now I feel not glad;
223,SUMMER MORNING.,"I miss the voices which were wont to sing,"
224,SUMMER MORNING.,"When on the hills I roamed, a happy lad."
225,SUMMER MORNING.,“Cuckoo!” it is the grave--not thee--that makes me sad.
226,SUMMER MORNING.,
227,SUMMER MORNING.,"Tell me, ye sages, whence these feelings rise,--"
228,SUMMER MORNING.,Sorrowful mornings on the darkened soul;
229,SUMMER MORNING.,"Glimpses of broken, bright, and stormy skies,"
230,SUMMER MORNING.,O’er which this earth--the heart--has no control?
231,SUMMER MORNING.,Why does the sea of thought thus backward roll?
232,SUMMER MORNING.,"Memory’s the breeze that through the cordage raves,"
233,SUMMER MORNING.,"And ever drives us on some home-ward shoal,"
234,SUMMER MORNING.,As if she loved the melancholy waves
235,SUMMER MORNING.,"That, murmuring shore-ward break, over a reef of graves."
236,SUMMER MORNING.,
237,SUMMER MORNING.,"Hark how the merry bells ring o’er the vale,"
238,SUMMER MORNING.,"Now near, remote, or lost, just as it blows."
239,SUMMER MORNING.,"The red cock sends his voice upon the gale,"
240,SUMMER MORNING.,From the thatched grange his answering rival crows:
241,SUMMER MORNING.,"The milkmaid o’er the dew-bathed meadow goes,"
242,SUMMER MORNING.,Her tucked-up kirtle ever holding tight;
243,SUMMER MORNING.,"And now her song rings through the green hedge-rows,"
244,SUMMER MORNING.,Her milk-kit hoops glitter like silver bright:--
245,SUMMER MORNING.,I hear her lover singing somewhere out of sight.
246,SUMMER MORNING.,
247,SUMMER MORNING.,"Where soars that spire, our rude forefathers prayed;"
248,SUMMER MORNING.,"Thither they came, from many a thick-leaved dell"
249,SUMMER MORNING.,"Year after year, and o’er those footpaths strayed,"
250,SUMMER MORNING.,"When summoned by the sounding Sabbath bell,--"
251,SUMMER MORNING.,For in those walls they deemed that God did dwell.
252,SUMMER MORNING.,And still they sleep within that bell’s deep sound.
253,SUMMER MORNING.,Yon Spire doth here of no distinction tell;
254,SUMMER MORNING.,"O’er rich and poor, marble, and earthly mound,"
255,SUMMER MORNING.,"The Monument of all,--it marks one common ground."
256,SUMMER MORNING.,
257,SUMMER MORNING.,"See yonder smoke, before it curls to Heaven"
258,SUMMER MORNING.,Mingles its blue amid the elm-trees tall;
259,SUMMER MORNING.,"Shrinking like one who fears to be forgiven,"
260,SUMMER MORNING.,"So on the earth again doth prostrate fall,"
261,SUMMER MORNING.,And ’mid the bending green each sin recall.
262,SUMMER MORNING.,"Now from their beds the cottage-children rise,"
263,SUMMER MORNING.,Roused by some early playmate’s noisy bawl;
264,SUMMER MORNING.,"And, on the door-step standing, rub their eyes,"
265,SUMMER MORNING.,"Stretching their little arms, and gaping at the skies."
266,SUMMER MORNING.,
267,SUMMER MORNING.,"The leaves “drop, drop,” and dot the crisped stream"
268,SUMMER MORNING.,"So quick, each circle wears the first away;"
269,SUMMER MORNING.,"Far out the tufted bulrush seems to dream,"
270,SUMMER MORNING.,And to the ripple nods its head alway;
271,SUMMER MORNING.,"The water-flags with one another play,"
272,SUMMER MORNING.,"Bowing to every breeze that blows between,"
273,SUMMER MORNING.,While purple dragon-flies their wings display:
274,SUMMER MORNING.,"The restless swallow’s arrowy flight is seen,"
275,SUMMER MORNING.,"Dimpling the sunny wave, then lost amid the green."
276,SUMMER MORNING.,
277,SUMMER MORNING.,"The boy who last night passed that darksome lane,"
278,SUMMER MORNING.,"Trembling at every sound, and pale with fear;"
279,SUMMER MORNING.,"Who shook when the long leaves talked to the rain,"
280,SUMMER MORNING.,"And tried to sing, his sinking heart to cheer;"
281,SUMMER MORNING.,"Hears now no brook wail ghost-like on his ear,"
282,SUMMER MORNING.,No dead-man’s groan in the black-beetle’s wing:
283,SUMMER MORNING.,"But where the deep-dyed butterflies appear,"
284,SUMMER MORNING.,"And on the flowers like folded pea-blooms swing,"
285,SUMMER MORNING.,With napless hat in hand he after them doth spring.
286,SUMMER MORNING.,
287,SUMMER MORNING.,"In the far sky the distant landscape melts,"
288,SUMMER MORNING.,Like pilèd clouds tinged with a darker hue;
289,SUMMER MORNING.,Even the wood which yon high upland belts
290,SUMMER MORNING.,"Looks like a range of clouds, of deeper blue."
291,SUMMER MORNING.,"One withered tree bursts only on the view,--"
292,SUMMER MORNING.,"A bald bare oak, which on the summit grows,"
293,SUMMER MORNING.,(And looks as if from out the sky it grew:)
294,SUMMER MORNING.,"That tree has borne a thousand wintry snows,"
295,SUMMER MORNING.,And seen unnumbered mornings gild its gnarled boughs.
296,SUMMER MORNING.,
297,SUMMER MORNING.,Yon weather-beaten grey old finger-post
298,SUMMER MORNING.,Stands like Time’s land-mark pointing to decay;
299,SUMMER MORNING.,The very roads it once marked out are lost:
300,SUMMER MORNING.,The common was encroached on every day
301,SUMMER MORNING.,"By grasping men who bore an unjust sway,"
302,SUMMER MORNING.,And rent the gift from Charity’s dead hands.
303,SUMMER MORNING.,"The post does still one broken arm display,"
304,SUMMER MORNING.,"Which now points out where the New Workhouse stands,"
305,SUMMER MORNING.,As if it said “Poor man! those walls are all thy lands.”
306,SUMMER MORNING.,
307,SUMMER MORNING.,"Where o’er yon woodland-stream dark branches bow,"
308,SUMMER MORNING.,"Patches of blue are let in from the sky,"
309,SUMMER MORNING.,"Throwing a chequered underlight below,"
310,SUMMER MORNING.,Where the deep waters steeped in gloom roll by;
311,SUMMER MORNING.,"Looking like Hope, who ever watcheth nigh,"
312,SUMMER MORNING.,"And throws her cheering ray o’er life’s long night,"
313,SUMMER MORNING.,When wearied man would fain lie down and die.
314,SUMMER MORNING.,"Past the broad meadow now it rolleth bright,"
315,SUMMER MORNING.,Which like a mantle green seems edged with silver light.
316,SUMMER MORNING.,
317,SUMMER MORNING.,"All things, save Man, this Summer morn rejoice:"
318,SUMMER MORNING.,"Sweet smiles the sky, so fair a world to view;"
319,SUMMER MORNING.,Unto the earth below the flowers give voice;
320,SUMMER MORNING.,Even the wayside-weed of homeliest hue
321,SUMMER MORNING.,"Looks up erect amid the golden blue,"
322,SUMMER MORNING.,And thus it speaketh to the thinking mind:--
323,SUMMER MORNING.,"“O’erlook me not! I for a purpose grew,"
324,SUMMER MORNING.,"Though long mayest thou that purpose try to find,"
325,SUMMER MORNING.,On us one sunshine falls! God only is not blind!”
326,SUMMER MORNING.,
327,SUMMER MORNING.,"England, my country!--land that gave me birth!"
328,SUMMER MORNING.,"Where those I love, living or dead, still dwell,"
329,SUMMER MORNING.,Most sacred spot--to me--of all the earth;
330,SUMMER MORNING.,England! “with all thy faults I love thee well.”
331,SUMMER MORNING.,With what delight I hear thy Sabbath bell
332,SUMMER MORNING.,"Fling to the sky its ancient English sound,"
333,SUMMER MORNING.,As if to the wide world it dared to tell
334,SUMMER MORNING.,"We own a God, who guards this envied ground,"
335,SUMMER MORNING.,Bulwarked with martyrs’ bones--where Fear was never found.
336,SUMMER MORNING.,
337,SUMMER MORNING.,"Here might a sinner humbly kneel and pray,"
338,SUMMER MORNING.,"With this bright sky, this lovely scene in view,"
339,SUMMER MORNING.,And worship Him who guardeth us alway!--
340,SUMMER MORNING.,"Who hung these lands with green, this sky with blue,"
341,SUMMER MORNING.,"Who spake, and from these plains huge cities grew;"
342,SUMMER MORNING.,"Who made thee, mighty England! what thou art,"
343,SUMMER MORNING.,And asked but gratitude for all His due.
344,SUMMER MORNING.,"The Giver, God! claims but the beggar’s part,"
345,SUMMER MORNING.,"And only doth require “a humble, contrite heart.”"
