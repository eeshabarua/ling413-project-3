86,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",for the illustration of which Burne-Jones actually executed a complete
87,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",series of pictures; and though the finished paintings are but four in

89,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","numerically smaller set is complete in the best sense, since not only"
90,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","does it illustrate fully the text and spirit of Morris's poem, but each"
91,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","picture in it, though finished with the loving care and elaboration"
92,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","which Burne-Jones lavished on his paintings, fails of its full"
93,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",significance unless considered in its relation to the series of which
94,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",it forms a part.
95,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",
96,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","In regard to the poem itself, the inspiration of these pictures, even"
97,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",the most casual study will bring in its train a conviction that the
98,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",story as told by William Morris is far superior to any other version
99,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",of classic or of modern times. The poem (one of the best of those
100,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",comprised in _The Earthly Paradise_) is homogeneous and admirably
101,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","balanced in all its parts; its superiority, however, over all other"
102,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","versions, is not due primarily to the manner of its narration, but"
103,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",arises from its greater spirituality--a finer feeling rather than a
104,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","finer form. Prior to the appearance of ""Pygmalion and the Image"" each"
105,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","narrator of the legend had dwelt mainly on the physical side, sensuous"
106,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","or sensual according to his temperament, of the tale. In Morris's"
107,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",version the dominant note is the passionate delight--enthusiasm verging
108,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","upon madness--of the artist and craftsman in his own handiwork,"
109,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","reflecting, to a marked degree, Morris's own temperament, one of the"
110,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",leading characteristics of which was his habit of hurling himself
111,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",headlong into each new project as it claimed his attention from time
112,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",to time. That he was prevented thereby from arriving at perfection
113,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",in any one art need not lessen the admiration due to him for his
114,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",whole-souled (though usually short-lived) absorption in many and
115,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","diverse arts. A great poet, in the sense that Chaucer, his master"
116,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","and model, was great, Morris was not; but no one can deny to him the"
117,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",title of an enthusiastic and skilled craftsman of verse. It is this
118,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","love of craftsmanship for its own sake, joined to a remarkable feeling"
119,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","for decorative beauty which both possessed, that binds the pictures"
120,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",of Burne-Jones and this poem by Morris so closely together that they
121,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",form one perfect whole. Even the ideal and wholly imaginary world in
122,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",which their figures move is the same--a land where emotion rather than
123,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","passion bears sway, where the fates of man and of woman are determined"
124,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",by a whim of the gods rather than dominated by the chivalrous or devout
125,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",hardihood of the individual.
126,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",
127,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","In his ""Apology"" prefixed to _The Earthly Paradise_, Morris clearly and"
128,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",definitely disclaims any moral purpose in the poems comprised in it.
129,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",
130,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","""Why should I strive to set the crooked straight?"" he writes. How"
131,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","far this feeling was shared by Burne-Jones we can never know, but"
132,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","nearly all of his biographers are agreed that a love of beauty, as"
133,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","he understood it, was his main preoccupation, or, to use his own"
134,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","words, that a picture should be a ""beautiful, romantic dream."" Julia"
135,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","Cartwright, in her _Life and Work of Sir Edward Burne-Jones_, says:"
136,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","""He never tried to point a moral or to teach a lesson; but he rescued"
137,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",beauty from the forgetfulness to which it seemed doomed in a restless
138,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","and material age, and in so doing has given us an example of the"
139,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","highest value."" Malcolm Bell, also, writing of the art of Burne-Jones"
140,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","and of its critics, expresses a like opinion, and his analysis of the"
141,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",paintings composing the Pygmalion Series is not only interesting in
142,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","itself, but is especially so as showing the extent to which the man of"
143,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",letters can read his own interpretation into the work of a painter.
144,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",
145,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","""The four pictures from 'The Story of Pygmalion,'"" he writes, ""also"
146,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","included in _The Earthly Paradise_, again show this preference of the"
147,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","poet and the artist for the spirit before the form, provided only the"
148,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","last be beautiful. The first, 'The Heart Desires,' is the idealization"
149,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","of unsatisfied longing for the unknown. Pygmalion, a tall, dark-haired"
150,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","young man, in a long garment falling in straight folds to his feet,"
151,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",stands brooding on life's emptiness in the vestibule of his house. A
152,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",sculptured group of the Three Graces denotes his profession and at the
153,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","same time typifies the cold beauty of artifice, the beauty of the mind,"
154,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","while two girls, seen through the open door, speeding along the street"
155,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","in the artless embrace of innocent maidenhood, represent the beauty of"
156,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",the body and the love that waits his winning; but in neither finds he
157,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","consolation. In the second, 'The Hand Refrains,' the days of long labor"
158,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","are ended, and the artist's ideal, the cold, pure figure of the yet"
159,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","soulless image stands finished on the still rough pedestal, surrounded"
160,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","by flakes and chips of marble and implements of the sculptor's craft,"
161,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","while Pygmalion, chisel and mallet in hand, stays gazing in awe at the"
162,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","marvel his hand has achieved, his eyes content, but his soul still"
163,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",hungering. Outside the window behind him women go about their daily
164,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","business in the city street, and through another casement, in a recess"
165,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","between him and the image, is a glimpse of a garden and a spurt of"
166,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",water falling into a marble basin--the constant dropping that wears
167,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","away the stone, as his constant prayers shall move the goddess Venus"
168,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","to a miracle on his behalf. The third bears the motto, 'The Godhead"
169,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","Fires.' Into the sculptor's chamber, silent and solitary, while"
170,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","Pygmalion is away in the temple, floats lightly the Queen of Love,"
171,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","clad in a soft, transparent robe, flower-crowned and bearing a branch"
172,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","of myrtle, emblem of marriage rites, her feet brushed and environed"
173,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","by the white wings of her favorite doves. Towards her, leaning both"
174,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","arms on one uplifted from the goddess's side, an exquisite piece of"
175,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","composition, the awakening image stoops from the carved capital,"
176,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","blossom-strewn by the adoring Pygmalion, her eyes raised in awe up to"
177,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","the goddess, who with fixed gaze and pointed finger inspires her with"
178,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","the Promethean fire of life. Lastly, 'The Soul Attains.' Heart and soul"
179,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","are alike satisfied. Pygmalion kneels, looking up in trembling worship"
180,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","at the beautiful creature who lingeringly yields him her hands, though"
181,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",she still gazes out beyond him in dumb amazement at the mystery of
182,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","consciousness that has suddenly been born in her. Marble no longer, but"
183,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","not yet altogether woman."""
184,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",
185,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","""Dreamer of dreams, born out of my due time,"" is even more appropriate"
186,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","to Burne-Jones than to its author, William Morris, and it is an"
187,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",ever-to-be-regretted misfortune that two poems only of those comprised
188,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.",in _The Earthly Paradise_ should have received at his hands that
189,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","illuminative pictorial treatment which he, ""the arch-dreamer of the"
190,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","nineteenth century,"" as Cosmo Monkhouse styles him, alone could"
191,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","give. Thanks to Mr. Frederick Hollyer, we have in the reproductions"
192,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","which follow faithful transcripts, in all but color, of the original"
193,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","paintings, and can carry out, after the lapse of a quarter of a century"
194,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","and in another hemisphere, a project which both Burne-Jones and William"
195,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","Morris held dear, but which neither of them lived to see realized. To"
196,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","their memory this book, together with the recently re-issued _Doom of"
197,"BY SIR EDWARD BURNE-JONES, BART.","King Acrisius_, is dedicated."

219,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"[Illustration: A]t Amathus, that from the southern side"
220,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Of Cyprus looks across the Syrian sea,"
221,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,There did in ancient time a man abide
222,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Known to the island-dwellers, for that he"
223,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Had wrought most godlike works in imagery,"
224,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And day by day still greater honor won,"
225,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Which man our old books call Pygmalion.
226,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
227,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet in the praise of men small joy he had,"
228,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But walked abroad with downcast, brooding face."
229,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Nor yet by any damsel was made glad;
230,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For, sooth to say, the women of that place"
231,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Must seem to all men an accursed race,"
232,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Who with the turner of all hearts once strove,"
233,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,So in their hearts must carry lust for love.
234,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
235,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Now on a day it chanced that he had been
236,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"About the streets, and on the crowded quays,"
237,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Rich with unopened wealth of bales, had seen"
238,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The dark-eyed merchants of the Southern seas
239,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"In chaffer with the base Propoetides,"
240,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And heavy-hearted gat him home again,"
241,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"His once-loved life grown idle, poor, and vain."
242,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
243,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And there upon his images he cast
244,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"His weary eyes, yet little noted them,"
245,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"As still from name to name his swift thought passed,"
246,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For what to him was Juno's well-wrought hem,"
247,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Diana's shaft, or Pallas' olive-stem?"
248,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"What help could Hermes' rod unto him give,"
249,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Until with shadowy things he came to live?
250,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
251,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet note, that though, while looking on the sun,"
252,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The craftsman o'er his work some morn of spring
253,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"May chide his useless labor never done,"
254,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For all his murmurs, with no other thing"
255,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He soothes his heart, and dulls thought's poisonous sting,"
256,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And thus in thought's despite the world goes on;
257,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And so it was with this Pygmalion.
258,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
259,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unto the chisel must he set his hand,"
260,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And slowly, still in troubled thought must pace"
261,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"About a work begun, that there doth stand,"
262,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And still returning to the self-same place,"
263,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unto the image now must set his face,"
264,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And with a sigh his wonted toil begin,"
265,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Half loathed, half loved, a little rest to win."
266,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
267,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The lessening marble that he worked upon,"
268,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"A woman's form now imaged doubtfully,"
269,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And in such guise the work had he begun,"
270,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Because when he the untouched block did see
271,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"In wandering veins that form there seemed to be,"
272,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Whereon he cried out in a careless mood,"
273,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""O lady Venus, make this presage good!"
274,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
275,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""And then this block of stone shall be thy maid,"
276,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, not without rich golden ornament,"
277,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Shall bide within thy quivering myrtle-shade."""
278,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"So spoke he, but the goddess, well content,"
279,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unto his hand such godlike mastery sent,"
280,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"That like the first artificer he wrought,"
281,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Who made the gift that woe to all men brought.
282,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
283,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And yet, but such as he was wont to do,"
284,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"At first indeed that work divine he deemed,"
285,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And as the white chips from the chisel flew
286,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Of other matters languidly he dreamed,"
287,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For easy to his hand that labor seemed,"
288,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And he was stirred with many a troubling thought,"
289,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And many a doubt perplexed him as he wrought.
290,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
291,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And yet, again, at last there came a day"
292,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"When smoother and more shapely grew the stone,"
293,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And he, grown eager, put all thought away"
294,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,But that which touched his craftsmanship alone;
295,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And he would gaze at what his hands had done,"
296,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Until his heart with boundless joy would swell
297,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,That all was wrought so wonderfully well.
298,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
299,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet long it was ere he was satisfied,"
300,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And with his pride that by his mastery
301,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"This thing was done, whose equal far and wide"
302,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"In no town of the world a man could see,"
303,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Came burning longing that the work should be
304,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"E'en better still, and to his heart there came"
305,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,A strange and strong desire he could not name.
306,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
307,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The night seemed long, and long the twilight seemed,"
308,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,A vain thing seemed his flowery garden fair;
309,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Though through the night still of his work he dreamed,"
310,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And though his smooth-stemmed trees so nigh it were
311,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"That thence he could behold the marble hair,"
312,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Naught was enough, until with steel in hand"
313,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,He came before the wondrous stone to stand.
314,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
315,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"No song could charm him, and no histories"
316,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Of men's misdoings could avail him now--
317,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Nay, scarcely seaward had he turned his eyes"
318,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"If men had said, ""The fierce Tyrrhenians row"
319,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Up through the bay; rise up and strike a blow
320,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For life and goods""; for naught to him seemed dear"
321,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,But to his well-loved work to be anear.
322,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
323,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then vexed he grew, and, knowing not his heart,"
324,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unto himself he said, ""Ah, what is this"
325,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,That I who oft was happy to depart
326,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And wander where the boughs each other kiss
327,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"'Neath the west wind, now have no other bliss"
328,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But in vain smoothing of this marble maid,"
329,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Whose chips this month a drachma had outweighed?
330,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
331,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Lo! I will get me to the woods and try"
332,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"If I my woodcraft have forgotten quite,"
333,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And then, returning, lay this folly by,"
334,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And eat my fill, and sleep my sleep anight,"
335,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And 'gin to carve a Hercules aright
336,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Upon the morrow, and perchance indeed"
337,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The Theban will be good to me at need."""
338,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
339,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"With that he took his quiver and his bow,"
340,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And through the gates of Amathus he went,"
341,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And towards the mountain slopes began to go,"
342,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Within the woods to work out his intent.
343,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Fair was the day, the honied bean-field's scent"
344,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The west wind bore unto him; o'er the way
345,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The glittering, noisy poplar leaves did play."
346,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
347,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,All things were moving; as his hurried feet
348,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Passed by, within the flowery swath he heard"
349,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The sweeping of the scythe, the swallow fleet"
350,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Rose over him, the sitting partridge stirred"
351,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"On the field's edge; the brown bee by him whirred,"
352,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Or murmured in the clover flowers below;
353,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,But he with bowed-down head failed not to go.
354,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
355,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"At last he stopped, and, looking round, he said,"
356,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Like one whose thirtieth year is well gone by,"
357,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The day is getting ready to be dead;
358,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"No rest, and on the border of the sky"
359,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Already the great banks of dark haze lie;
360,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,No rest--what do I midst this stir and noise?--
361,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"What part have I in these unthinking joys?"""
362,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
363,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"With that he turned, and towards the city gate"
364,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Through the sweet fields went swifter than he came,"
365,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And cast his heart into the hands of fate;
366,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Nor strove with it, when higher 'gan to flame"
367,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,That strange and strong desire without a name;
368,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Till panting, thinking of naught else, once more"
369,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,His hand was on the latch of his own door.
370,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
371,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"One moment there he lingered, as he said,"
372,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Alas! what should I do if she were gone?"""
373,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,But even with that word his brow waxed red
374,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"To hear his own lips name a thing of stone,"
375,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"As though the gods some marvel there had done,"
376,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And made his work alive; and therewithal,"
377,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"In turn, great pallor on his face did fall."
378,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
379,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,But with a sigh he passed into the house;
380,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet even then his chamber door must hold,"
381,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And listen there, half blind and timorous,"
382,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Until his heart should wax a little bold;
383,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then, entering, motionless and white and cold,"
384,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,He saw the image stand amidst the floor
385,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,That whitened was by labor done before.

391,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,[Illustration]
392,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
393,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
394,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Blinded with tears, his chisel up he caught,"
395,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, drawing near and sighing, tenderly"
396,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Upon the marvel of the face he wrought,"
397,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,E'en as he used to pass the long days by;
398,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But his sighs changed to sobbing presently,"
399,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And on the floor the useless steel he flung,"
400,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, weeping loud, about the image clung."
401,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
402,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Alas!"" he cried, ""why have I made thee, then,"
403,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,That thus thou mockest me? I know indeed
404,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"That many such as thou are loved of men,"
405,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Whose passionate eyes poor wretches still will lead
406,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Into their net, and smile to see them bleed;"
407,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But these the gods made, and this hand made thee,"
408,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Who wilt not speak one little word to me."""
409,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
410,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Then from the image did he draw aback
411,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"To gaze on it through tears; and you had said,"
412,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Regarding it, that little did it lack"
413,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,To be a living and most lovely maid;
414,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Naked it was, its unbound locks were laid"
415,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Over the lovely shoulders; with one hand
416,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Reached out, as to a lover, did it stand;"
417,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
418,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The other held a fair rose over-blown;
419,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"No smile was on the parted lips, the eyes"
420,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Seemed as if even now great love had shown
421,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unto them, something of its sweet surprise,"
422,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet saddened them with half-seen mysteries,"
423,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And still midst passion maiden-like she seemed,"
424,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,As though of love unchanged for aye she dreamed.
425,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
426,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Reproachfully beholding all her grace,"
427,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Pygmalion stood, until he grew dry-eyed,"
428,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And then at last he turned away his face
429,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,As if from her cold eyes his grief to hide;
430,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And thus a weary while did he abide,"
431,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"With nothing in his heart but vain desire,"
432,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The ever-burning, unconsuming fire."
433,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
434,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,But when again he turned his visage round
435,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"His eyes were brighter and no more he wept,"
436,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"As if some little solace he had found,"
437,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Although his folly none the more had slept,"
438,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Rather some new-born, god-sent madness kept"
439,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"His other madness from destroying him,"
440,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And made the hope of death wax faint and dim;
441,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
442,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For, trembling and ashamed, from out the street"
443,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Strong men he called, and faint with jealousy"
444,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He caused them bear the ponderous, moveless feet"
445,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unto the chamber where he used to lie,"
446,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"So in a fair niche to his bed anigh,"
447,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unwitting of his woe, they set it down,"
448,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Then went their ways beneath his troubled frown.
449,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
450,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then to his treasury he went, and sought"
451,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For gems for its adornment, but all there"
452,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Seemed to his eager eyes but poor and naught,"
453,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Not worthy e'en to touch her rippled hair.
454,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"So he, departing, through the streets 'gan fare,"
455,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And from the merchants at a mighty cost
456,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Bought gems that kings for no good deed had lost.
457,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
458,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"These, then, he hung her senseless neck around,"
459,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Set on her fingers, and fair arms of stone,"
460,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then cast himself before her on the ground,"
461,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Praying for grace for all that he had done
462,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,In leaving her untended and alone;
463,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And still with every hour his madness grew
464,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Though all his folly in his heart he knew.
465,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
466,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"At last asleep before her feet he lay,"
467,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Worn out with passion, yet this burning pain"
468,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Returned on him, when with the light of day"
469,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,He woke and wept before her feet again;
470,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then of the fresh and new-born morning fain,"
471,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Into his garden passed, and therefrom bore"
472,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Fresh spoil of flowers his love to lay before.
473,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
474,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"A little altar, with fine gold o'erlaid,"
475,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Was in his house, that he a while ago"
476,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"At some great man's command had deftly made,"
477,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And this he now must take and set below
478,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Her well-wrought feet, and there must red flame glow"
479,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"About sweet wood, and he must send her thence"
480,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The odor of Arabian frankincense.
481,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
482,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then as the smoke went up, he prayed and said,"
483,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Thou, image, hear'st me not, nor wilt thou speak,"
484,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But I perchance shall know when I am dead,"
485,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"If this has been some goddess' sport, to seek"
486,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"A wretch, and in his heart infirm and weak"
487,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"To set her glorious image, so that he,"
488,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Loving the form of immortality.
489,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
490,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""May make much laughter for the gods above:"
491,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Hear me, and if my love misliketh thee"
492,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then take my life away, for I will love"
493,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Till death unfeared at last shall come to me,"
494,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And give me rest, if he of might may be"
495,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"To slay the love of that which cannot die,"
496,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The heavenly beauty that can ne'er pass by."""
497,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
498,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"No word, indeed, the moveless image said,"
499,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But with the sweet, grave eyes his hands had wrought"
500,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Still gazed down on his bowed, imploring head;"
501,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet his own words some solace to him brought,"
502,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Gilding the net wherein his soul was caught
503,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"With something like to hope, and all that day"
504,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Some tender words he ever found to say;
505,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
506,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And still he felt as something heard him speak;
507,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Sometimes he praised her beauty, and sometimes"
508,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Reproached her in a feeble voice and weak,"
509,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And at the last drew forth a book of rhymes,"
510,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Wherein were writ the tales of many climes,"
511,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And read aloud the sweetness hid therein
512,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Of lovers' sorrows and their tangled sin.
513,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
514,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And when the sun went down, the frankincense"
515,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Again upon the altar-flame he cast,"
516,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,That through the open window floating thence
517,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,O'er the fresh odors of the garden passed;
518,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And so another day was gone at last,"
519,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And he no more his lovelorn watch could keep,"
520,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,But now for utter weariness must sleep.
521,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
522,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But in the night he dreamed that she was gone,"
523,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, knowing that he dreamed, tried hard to wake,"
524,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And could not, but, forsaken and alone,"
525,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,He seemed to weep as though his heart would break;
526,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And when the night her sleepy veil did take
527,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"From off the world, waking, his tears he found"
528,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Still wet upon the pillow all around.
529,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
530,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then at the first, bewildered by those tears,"
531,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He fell a-wondering wherefore he had wept,"
532,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But suddenly remembering all his fears,"
533,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Panting with terror, from the bed he leapt;"
534,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But still its wonted place the image kept,"
535,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Nor moved for all the joyful ecstasy
536,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Wherewith he blessed the day that showed it nigh.
537,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
538,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then came the morning offering, and the day,"
539,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Midst flowers and words of love and kisses sweet,"
540,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"From morn, through noon, to evening passed away;"
541,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And scarce unhappy, crouching at her feet,"
542,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,He saw the sun descend the sea to meet;
543,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And scarce unhappy through the darkness crept
544,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unto his bed, and midst soft dreaming slept."
545,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
546,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
547,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"[Illustration: B]ut the next morn, e'en while the incense-smoke"
548,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"At sun-rising curled round about her head,"
549,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Sweet sound of songs the wonted quiet broke
550,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Down in the street, and he by something led,"
551,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He knew not what, must leave his prayer unsaid,"
552,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And through the freshness of the morn must see
553,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The folk who went with that sweet minstrelsy;
554,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
555,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Damsels and youths in wonderful attire,"
556,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And in their midst upon a car of gold
557,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"An image of the Mother of Desire,"
558,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Wrought by his hands in days that seemed grown old,"
559,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Though those sweet limbs a garment did enfold,"
560,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Colored like flame, enwrought with precious things,"
561,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Most fit to be the prize of striving kings.

569,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
570,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Then he remembered that the manner was
571,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,That fair-clad priests the lovely Queen should take
572,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Thrice in the year, and through the city pass,"
573,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And with sweet songs the dreaming folk awake;
574,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And through the clouds a light there seemed to break
575,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,When he remembered all the tales well told
576,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"About her glorious, kindly deeds of old."
577,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
578,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"So his unfinished prayer he finished not,"
579,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But, kneeling, once more kissed the marble feet,"
580,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, while his heart with many thoughts waxed hot,"
581,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,He clad himself with fresh attire and meet
582,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For that bright service, and with blossoms sweet"
583,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Entwined with tender leaves he crowned his head,"
584,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And followed after as the goddess led.
585,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
586,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,But long and vain unto him seemed the way
587,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Until they came unto her house again;
588,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Long years, the while they went about to lay"
589,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The honey-hiding dwellers on the plain,"
590,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The sweet companions of the yellowing grain
591,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Upon her golden altar; long and long
592,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Before, at end of their delicious song,"
593,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
594,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,They stripped her of her weed with reverent hands
595,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And showed the ivory limbs his hand had wrought;
596,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yea, and too long e'en then ere those fair bands,"
597,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Dispersing here and there, the shadow sought"
598,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Of Indian spice-trees o'er the warm sea brought,"
599,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And toward the splashing of the fountain turned,"
600,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Mocked the noon sun that o'er the cloisters burned.
601,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
602,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But when the crowd of worshippers was gone,"
603,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And through the golden dimness of the place
604,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The goddess' very servants paced alone,"
605,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Or some lone damsel murmured of her case
606,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Apart from prying eyes, he turned his face"
607,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unto that image made with toil and care,"
608,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,In days when unto him it seemed most fair.
609,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
610,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Dusky and dim, though rich with gems and gold,"
611,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The house of Venus was. High in the dome
612,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The burning sunlight you might now behold;
613,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"From nowhere else the light of day might come,"
614,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,To curse the Shame-faced Mother's lovely home;
615,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"A long way off the shrine, the fresh sea-breeze,"
616,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Now just arising, brushed the myrtle-trees."
617,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
618,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The torches of the flower-crowned, singing band"
619,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Erewhile, indeed, made more than daylight there,"
620,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Lighting the painted tales of many a land,"
621,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And carven heroes, with their unused glare;"
622,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But now a few soft, glimmering lamps there were,"
623,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And on the altar a thin, flickering flame"
624,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Just showed the golden letters of her name.
625,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
626,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Blue in the dome yet hung the incense-cloud,"
627,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And still its perfume lingered all around;
628,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, trodden by the light-foot, fervent crowd,"
629,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Thick lay the summer flowers upon the ground,"
630,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And now from far-off halls uprose the sound
631,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Of Lydian music, and the dancer's cry,"
632,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,As though some door were opened suddenly.
633,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
634,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"So there he stood, that help from her to gain,"
635,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Bewildered by that twilight midst of day;
636,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Downcast with listening to the joyous strain
637,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He had no part in, hopeless with delay"
638,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Of all the fair things he had meant to say;
639,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet, as the incense on the flame he cast,"
640,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,From stammering lips and pale these words there passed:

642,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""O thou forgotten help, dost thou yet know"
643,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"What thing it is I need, when even I,"

645,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Can frame no set of words to tell thee why
646,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"I needs must pray? Oh, help me or I die!"
647,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Or slay me, and in slaying take from me"
648,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Even a dead man's feeble memory.
649,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
650,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Say not thine help I have been slow to seek;"
651,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Here have I been from the first hour of morn,"
652,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Who stand before thy presence faint and weak,"
653,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Of my one poor delight left all forlorn;
654,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Trembling with many fears, the hope outworn"
655,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"I had when first I left my love, my shame,"
656,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"To call upon thine oft-sung, glorious name."""
657,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
658,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He stopped to catch his breath, for as a sob"
659,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Did each word leave his mouth; but suddenly,"
660,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Like a live thing, the thin flame 'gan to throb"
661,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And gather force, and then shot up on high"
662,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"A steady spike of light, that drew anigh"
663,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The sunbeam in the dome, then sank once more"
664,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Into a feeble flicker as before.
665,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
666,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But at that sight the nameless hope he had,"
667,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"That kept him living midst unhappiness,"
668,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Stirred in his breast, and with changed face and glad"
669,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Unto the image forward must he press
670,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,With words of praise his first word to redress;
671,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But then it was as though a thick, black cloud"
672,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Altar and fire and ivory limbs did shroud.
673,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
674,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He staggered back, amazed and full of awe;"
675,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But when, with anxious eyes, he gazed around,"
676,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,About him still the worshippers he saw
677,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Sunk in their wonted works, with no surprise"
678,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,At what to him seemed awful mysteries;
679,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Therewith he sighed and said, ""This, too, I dream,"
680,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"No better day upon my life shall beam."""
681,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
682,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And yet for long upon the place he gazed
683,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Where other folk beheld the lovely Queen;
684,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And while he looked the dusky veil seemed raised,"
685,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And everything was as it erst had been;
686,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And then he said, ""Such marvels I have seen"
687,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,As some sick man may see from off his bed--
688,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Ah, I am sick, and would that I were dead!"""
689,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
690,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Therewith, not questioning his heart at all,"
691,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He turned away and left the holy place,"
692,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"When now the wide sun reddened towards his fall,"
693,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And a fresh west wind held the clouds in chase;
694,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But coming out, at first he hid his face,"
695,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Dazed with the light, and in the porch he stood,"
696,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Nor wished to move or change his dreary mood.
697,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
698,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Yet in a while the freshness of the eve
699,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Pierced to his weary heart, and with a sigh"
700,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,He raised his head and slowly 'gan to leave
701,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The high, carved pillars; and so presently"
702,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Had passed the grove of whispering myrtles by,"
703,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, mid the many noises of the street,"
704,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Made himself brave the eyes of men to meet.
705,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
706,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Thronged were the ways with folk in gay attire,"
707,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Nursing the end of that festivity;
708,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Girls fit to move the moody man's desire
709,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Brushed past him, and soft, dainty minstrelsy"
710,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He heard amid the laughter, and might see,"
711,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Through open doors, the garden's green delight,"
712,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Where pensive lovers waited for the night;
713,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
714,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Or resting dancers round the fountain drawn,"
715,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"With faces flushed unto the breeze turned round,"
716,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Or wandering o'er the fragrant, trodden lawn,"
717,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Took up their fallen garlands from the ground;
718,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Or languidly their scattered tresses bound,"
719,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Or let their gathered raiment fall adown,"
720,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,With eyes downcast beneath their lovers' frown.
721,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
722,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"What hope Pygmalion yet might have, when he"
723,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"First left the pillars of the dreamy place,"
724,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Amid such sights had vanished utterly.
725,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He turned his weary eyes from face to face,"
726,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Nor noted them, as at a lagging pace"
727,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He gat towards home, and still was murmuring,"
728,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Ah, life, sweet life! the only godlike thing!"""
729,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
730,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And as he went, though longing to be there"
731,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Whereas his sole desire awaited him,"
732,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet did he loath to see the image fair,"
733,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"White and unchanged of face, unmoved of limb,"
734,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And to his heart came dreamy thoughts and dim
735,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"That unto some strange region he might come,"
736,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Nor ever reach again his loveless home.
737,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
738,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet soon, indeed, before his door he stood,"
739,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, as a man awaking from a dream,"
740,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Seemed waked from his old folly; naught seemed good
741,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,In all the things that he before had deemed
742,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"At least worth life, and on his heart there streamed"

772,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He stood within; but there, for very shame"
773,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Of all the things that he had done before,"
774,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Still kept his eyes bent down upon the floor,"
775,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Thinking of all that he had done and said
776,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Since he had wrought that luckless marble maid.
777,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
778,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet soft his thoughts were, and the very place"
779,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Seemed perfumed with some nameless heavenly air;
780,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"So gaining courage, did he raise his face"
781,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unto the work his hands had made so fair,"
782,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And cried aloud to see the niche all bare
783,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Of that sweet form, while through his heart again"
784,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,There shot a pang of his old yearning pain.
785,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
786,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Yet while he stood, and knew not what to do"
787,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"With yearning, a strange thrill of hope there came,"
788,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"A shaft of new desire now pierced him through,"
789,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And therewithal a soft voice called his name;
790,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And when he turned, with eager eyes aflame,"
791,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He saw, betwixt him and the setting sun,"
792,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,The lively image of his loved one.
793,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
794,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He trembled at the sight, for though her eyes,"
795,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Her very lips, were such as he had made,"
796,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And though her tresses fell but in such guise
797,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"As he had wrought them, now was she arrayed"
798,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,In that fair garment that the priests had laid
799,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Upon the goddess on that very morn,"
800,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Dyed like the setting sun upon the corn.
801,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
802,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Speechless he stood, but she now drew anear,"
803,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Simple and sweet as she was wont to be,"
804,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And once again her silver voice rang clear,"
805,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Filling his soul with great felicity,"
806,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And thus she spoke: ""Wilt thou not come to me,"
807,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"O dear companion of my new-found life,"
808,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,For I am called thy lover and thy wife?
809,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
810,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Listen, these words the Dread One bade me say"
811,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"That was with me e'en now, _Pygmalion,"
812,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"My new-made soul I give to thee to-day,"
813,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Come, feel the sweet breath that thy prayer has won,"
814,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And lay thine hand this heaving breast upon!
815,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Come, love, and walk with me between the trees,"
816,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And feel the freshness of the evening breeze._
817,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
818,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""_Sweep mine hair round thy neck; behold my feet,"
819,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The oft-kissed feet thou thoughtst should never move,"
820,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Press down the daisies! draw me to thee, sweet,"
821,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And feel the warm heart of thy living love
822,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Beat against thine, and bless the Seed of Jove,"
823,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Whose loving, tender heart hath wrought all this,"
824,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And wrapped us both in such a cloud of bliss._
825,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
826,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Ah, thou art wise to know what this may mean!"
827,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Sweet seem the words to me, and needs must I"
828,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Speak all the lesson of the lovely Queen;
829,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But this I know, I would we were more nigh,"
830,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,I have not heard thy voice but in the cry
831,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Thou utteredst then, when thou believedst gone"
832,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The marvel of thine hands, the maid of stone."""
833,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
834,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"She reached her hand to him, and with kind eyes"
835,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Gazed into his; but he the fingers caught
836,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And drew her to him, and midst ecstasies"
837,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Passing all words, yea, wellnigh passing thought,"
838,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Felt that sweet breath that he so long had sought,"
839,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Felt the warm life within her heaving breast
840,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,As in his arms his living love he pressed.
841,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
842,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But as his cheek touched hers he heard her say,"
843,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Wilt thou not speak, O love? Why dost thou weep?"
844,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Art thou then sorry for this long-wished day,"
845,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Or dost thou think perchance thou wilt not keep
846,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"This that thou holdest, but in dreamy sleep?"
847,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Nay, let us do the bidding of the Queen,"
848,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And hand in hand walk through thy garden green;
849,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
850,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Then shalt thou tell me, still beholding me,"
851,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Full many things whereof I wish to know;
852,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And as we walk from whispering tree to tree
853,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Still more familiar to thee shall I grow,"
854,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And such things shalt thou say unto me now
855,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"As when thou deemedst thou wast quite alone,"
856,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"A madman, kneeling to a thing of stone."""
857,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
858,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But at that word a smile lit up his eyes,"
859,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And therewithal he spake some loving word,"
860,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And she at first looked up in grave surprise
861,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"When his deep voice and musical she heard,"
862,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And clung to him as somewhat grown afeard;
863,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then cried aloud and said, ""O mighty one!"
864,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"What joy with thee to look upon the sun!"""
865,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
866,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then into that fair garden did they pass,"
867,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And all the story of his love he told;
868,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And as the twain went o'er the dewy grass,"
869,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Beneath the risen moon could he behold
870,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"The bright tears trickling down; then, waxen bold,"
871,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"He stopped and said, ""Ah, love, what meaneth this?"
872,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Seest thou how tears still follow earthly bliss?"""
873,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
874,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then both her white arms round his neck she threw,"
875,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, sobbing, said: ""O love, what hurteth me?"
876,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"When first the sweetness of my life I knew,"
877,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Not this I felt; but when I first saw thee
878,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,A little pain and great felicity
879,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Rose up within me, and thy talk e'en now"
880,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Made pain and pleasure ever greater grow."""
881,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
882,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""O sweet,"" he said, ""this thing is even love,"
883,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Whereof I told thee; that all wise men fear,"
884,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But yet escape not; nay, to gods above,"
885,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Unless the old tales lie, it draweth near."
886,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But let my happy ears, I pray thee, hear"
887,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Thy story, too, and how thy blessed birth"
888,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Has made a heaven of this once lonely earth.
889,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
890,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""My sweet,"" she said, ""as yet I am not wise,"
891,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Or stored with words, aright the tale to tell;"
892,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,But listen: when I opened first mine eyes
893,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"I stood within the niche thou knowest well,"
894,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And from mine hand a heavy thing there fell,"
895,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Carved like these flowers, nor could I see things clear,"
896,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And but a strange, confused noise could hear."
897,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
898,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""At last mine eyes could see a woman fair,"
899,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But awful as this round, white moon o'erhead."
900,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"So that I trembled when I saw her there,"
901,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For with my life was born some touch of dread,"
902,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And therewithal I heard her voice, that said,"
903,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"'Come down, and learn to love and be alive,"
904,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For thee, a well-prized gift, to-day I give.'"
905,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
906,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Then on the floor I stepped, rejoicing much,"
907,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Not knowing why, not knowing aught at all,"
908,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Till she reached out her hand my breast to touch;
909,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And when her fingers thereupon did fall,"
910,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Thought came unto my life, and therewithal"
911,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"I knew her for a goddess, and began"
912,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,To murmur in some tongue unknown to man.

919,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
920,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
921,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""And then, indeed, not in this guise was I;"
922,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"No sandals had I, and no saffron gown,"
923,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But naked as thou knowest utterly,"
924,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,E'en as my limbs beneath thine hand had grown;
925,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And this fair, perfumed robe then fell adown"
926,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Over the goddess' feet, and swept the ground,"
927,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And round her loins a glittering belt was bound.
928,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
929,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""But when the stammering of my tongue she heard"
930,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Upon my trembling lips her hand she laid,"
931,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And spoke again: 'Nay, say not any word;"
932,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"All that thine heart would say I know unsaid,"
933,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Who even now thine heart and voice have made;
934,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But listen rather, for thou knowest now"
935,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"What these words mean, and still wilt wiser grow."
936,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
937,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""'Thy body, lifeless till I gave it life,"
938,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"A certain man, my servant, well hath wrought."
939,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"I give thee to him as his love and wife,"
940,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"With all thy dowry of desire and thought,"
941,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Since this his yearning heart hath ever sought.
942,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Now from my temple is he on the way,"
943,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Deeming to find thee e'en as yesterday.
944,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
945,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""'Bide thou his coming by the bed-head there,"
946,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And when thou seest him set his eyes upon
947,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Thine empty niche, and hearest him cry for care,"
948,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Then call him by his name, Pygmalion,"
949,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,And certainly thy lover hast thou won;
950,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"But when he stands before thee silently,"
951,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Say all these words that I shall teach to thee.'
952,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
953,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""With that she said what first I told thee, love,"
954,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And then went on: 'Moreover, thou shalt say"
955,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"That I, the daughter of almighty Jove,"
956,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Have wrought for him this long-desired day;
957,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"In sign whereof these things that pass away,"
958,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Wherein mine image men have well arrayed,"
959,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"I give thee for thy wedding-gear, O maid.'"
960,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
961,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""Therewith her raiment she put off from her,"
962,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And laid bare all her perfect loveliness,"
963,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And, smiling on me, came yet more anear,"
964,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And on my mortal lips her lips did press,"
965,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And said, 'Now herewith shalt thou love no less"
966,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Than Psyche loved my son in days of old.
967,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Farewell. Of thee shall many a tale be told.'
968,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
969,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"""And even with that last word was she gone--"
970,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"How, I know not--and I my limbs arrayed"
971,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"In her fair gifts, and waited thee alone."
972,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Ah, love, indeed the word is true she said,"
973,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"For now I love thee so, I grow afraid"
974,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Of what the gods upon our heads may send--
975,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"I love thee so, I think upon the end."""
976,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,
977,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,What words he said? How can I tell again
978,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,What words they said beneath the glimmering light?
979,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Some tongue they used unknown to loveless men
980,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"As each to each they told their great delight,"
981,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,Until for stillness of the growing night
982,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"Their soft, sweet, murmuring words seemed growing loud,"
983,_WILLIAM MORRIS_,"And dim the moon grew, hid by fleecy cloud."
