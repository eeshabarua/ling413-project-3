350,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"MY DEAR FRIEND--The Tale of 'Peter Bell', which I now introduce to"
351,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"your notice, and to that of the Public, has, in its Manuscript state,"
352,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],nearly survived its _minority_:--for it first saw the light in the
353,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"summer of 1798. During this long interval, pains have been taken at"
354,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],different times to make the production less unworthy of a favourable
355,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"reception; or, rather, to fit it for filling _permanently_ a station,"
356,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"however humble, in the Literature of our Country. This has, indeed,"
357,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"been the aim of all my endeavours in Poetry, which, you know, have"
358,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],been sufficiently laborious to prove that I deem the Art not lightly
359,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"to be approached; and that the attainment of excellence in it, may"
360,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],laudably be made the principal object of intellectual pursuit by any
361,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"man, who, with reasonable consideration of circumstances, has faith in"
362,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],his own impulses.
363,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],
364,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"The Poem of 'Peter Bell', as the Prologue will show, was composed"
365,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],under a belief that the Imagination not only does not require for its
366,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"exercise the intervention of supernatural agency, but that, though"
367,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"such agency be excluded, the faculty may be called forth as"
368,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"imperiously and for kindred results of pleasure, by incidents, within"
369,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"the compass of poetic probability, in the humblest departments of"
370,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"daily life. Since that Prologue was written, _you_ have exhibited most"
371,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"splendid effects of judicious daring, in the opposite and usual"
372,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],course. Let this acknowledgment make my peace with the lovers of the
373,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"supernatural; and I am persuaded it will be admitted, that to you, as"
374,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"a Master in that province of the art, the following Tale, whether from"
375,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"contrast or congruity, is not an unappropriate offering. Accept it,"
376,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"then, as a public testimony of affectionate admiration from one with"
377,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],whose name yours has been often coupled (to use your own words) for
378,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"evil and for good; and believe me to be, with earnest wishes that life"
379,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],and health may be granted you to complete the many important works in
380,PETER BELL: A TALE [A],"which you are engaged, and with high respect, Most faithfully yours,"

384,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"RYDAL MOUNT, April 7, 1819."
385,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,
386,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,
387,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,[Written at Alfoxden. Founded upon an anecdote which I read in a
388,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"newspaper, of an ass being found hanging his head over a canal in a"
389,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"wretched posture. Upon examination a dead body was found in the water,"
390,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"and proved to be the body of its master. The countenance, gait, and"
391,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,figure of Peter were taken from a wild rover with whom I walked from
392,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"Builth, on the river Wye, downwards, nearly as far as the town of Hay."
393,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,He told me strange stories. It has always been a pleasure to me through
394,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"life, to catch at every opportunity that has occurred in my rambles of"
395,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,becoming acquainted with this class of people. The number of Peter's
396,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"wives was taken from the trespasses, in this way, of a lawless creature,"
397,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"who lived in the county of Durham, and used to be attended by many"
398,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"women, sometimes not less than half a dozen, as disorderly as himself,"
399,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"and a story went in the country that he had been heard to say, while"
400,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"they were quarrelling, ""Why can't ye be quiet, there's none so many of"
401,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"you?"" Benoni, or the child of sorrow, I knew when I was a schoolboy. His"
402,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"mother had been deserted by a gentleman in the neighbourhood, she"
403,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,herself being a gentlewoman by birth. The circumstances of her story
404,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"were told me by my dear old dame, Ann Tyson, who was her confidante. The"
405,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,lady died broken-hearted. In the woods of Alfoxden I used to take great
406,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"delight in noticing the habits, tricks, and physiognomy of asses; and I"
407,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,have no doubt that I was thus put upon writing the poem out of liking
408,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"for the creature that is often so dreadfully abused. The crescent moon,"
409,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"which makes such a figure in the prologue, assumed this character one"
410,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,evening while I was watching its beauty in front of Alfoxden House. I
411,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"intended this poem for the volume before spoken of, but it was not"
412,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,published for more than twenty years afterwards. The worship of the
413,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"Methodists, or Ranters, is often heard during the stillness of the"
414,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"summer evening, in the country, with affecting accompaniments of rural"
415,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"beauty. In both the psalmody and voice of the preacher there is, not"
416,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,"unfrequently, much solemnity likely to impress the feelings of the"
417,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.,rudest characters under favourable circumstances.--I. F.]

872,PART FIRST,Right through the quarry;--and behold
873,PART FIRST,A scene of soft and lovely hue!
874,PART FIRST,"Where blue and grey, and tender green,"
875,PART FIRST,Together make [30] as sweet a scene
876,PART FIRST,As ever human eye did view.                              365
877,PART FIRST,
878,PART FIRST,Beneath the clear blue sky he saw
879,PART FIRST,A little field of meadow ground;
880,PART FIRST,But field or meadow name it not;
881,PART FIRST,"Call it of earth a small green plot,"
882,PART FIRST,With rocks encompassed round.                            370
883,PART FIRST,
884,PART FIRST,"The Swale flowed under the grey rocks,"
885,PART FIRST,But he flowed quiet and unseen;--
886,PART FIRST,You need a strong and stormy gale
887,PART FIRST,To bring the noises of the Swale
888,PART FIRST,"To that green spot, so calm and green!                   375"
889,PART FIRST,
890,PART FIRST,[31]
891,PART FIRST,
892,PART FIRST,"And is there no one dwelling here,"
893,PART FIRST,No hermit with his beads and glass?
894,PART FIRST,And does no little cottage look
895,PART FIRST,Upon this soft and fertile nook?
896,PART FIRST,Does no one live near this green grass?                  380
897,PART FIRST,
898,PART FIRST,Across the [32] deep and quiet spot
899,PART FIRST,Is Peter driving through the grass--
900,PART FIRST,And now has reached the skirting trees; [33]
901,PART FIRST,"When, turning round his head, he sees"
902,PART FIRST,A solitary Ass.                                          385
903,PART FIRST,
904,PART FIRST,[34]
905,PART FIRST,
906,PART FIRST,"""A prize!"" cries Peter--but he first"
907,PART FIRST,Must spy about him far and near: [35]
908,PART FIRST,"There's not a single house in sight,"
909,PART FIRST,"No woodman's hut, no cottage light--"
910,PART FIRST,"Peter, you need not fear!                                390"
911,PART FIRST,
912,PART FIRST,"There's nothing to be seen but woods,"
913,PART FIRST,"And rocks that spread a hoary gleam,"
914,PART FIRST,"And this one Beast, that from the bed"
915,PART FIRST,Of the green meadow hangs his head
916,PART FIRST,Over the silent stream.                                  395
917,PART FIRST,
918,PART FIRST,His head is with a halter bound;
919,PART FIRST,"The halter seizing, Peter leapt"
920,PART FIRST,"Upon the Creature's back, [36] and plied"
921,PART FIRST,With ready heels his shaggy side; [37]
922,PART FIRST,But still the Ass his station kept.                      400
923,PART FIRST,
924,PART FIRST,[38]
925,PART FIRST,
926,PART FIRST,"Then Peter gave a sudden jerk,"
927,PART FIRST,A jerk that from a dungeon-floor
928,PART FIRST,Would have pulled up an iron ring;
929,PART FIRST,But still the heavy-headed Thing
930,PART FIRST,Stood just as he had stood before!                       405
931,PART FIRST,
932,PART FIRST,"Quoth Peter, leaping from his seat,"
933,PART FIRST,"""There is some plot against me laid"";"
934,PART FIRST,Once more the little meadow-ground
935,PART FIRST,And all the hoary cliffs around
936,PART FIRST,He cautiously surveyed.                                  410
937,PART FIRST,
938,PART FIRST,"All, all is silent--rocks and woods,"
939,PART FIRST,All still and silent--far and near!
940,PART FIRST,"Only the Ass, with motion dull,"
941,PART FIRST,Upon the pivot of his skull
942,PART FIRST,Turns round his long left ear.                           415
943,PART FIRST,
944,PART FIRST,"Thought Peter, What can mean all this?"
945,PART FIRST,Some ugly witchcraft must be here!
946,PART FIRST,"--Once more the Ass, with motion dull,"
947,PART FIRST,Upon the pivot of his skull
948,PART FIRST,Turned round his long left ear.                          420
949,PART FIRST,
950,PART FIRST,Suspicion ripened into dread;
951,PART FIRST,"Yet with deliberate action slow,"
952,PART FIRST,"His staff high-raising, in the pride"
953,PART FIRST,"Of skill, upon the sounding hide, [39]"
954,PART FIRST,He dealt a sturdy blow.                                  425
955,PART FIRST,
956,PART FIRST,The poor Ass staggered with the shock;
957,PART FIRST,"And then, as if to take his ease, [40]"
958,PART FIRST,"In quiet uncomplaining mood,"
959,PART FIRST,"Upon the spot where he had stood,"
960,PART FIRST,Dropped gently down upon his knees;                      430
961,PART FIRST,
962,PART FIRST,As gently on [41] his side he fell;
963,PART FIRST,And by the river's brink did lie;
964,PART FIRST,"And, while [42] he lay like one that mourned,"
965,PART FIRST,The patient Beast on Peter turned
966,PART FIRST,His shining hazel eye. [43]                              435
967,PART FIRST,
968,PART FIRST,"'Twas but one mild, reproachful look,"
969,PART FIRST,A look more tender than severe;
970,PART FIRST,"And straight in sorrow, not in dread,"
971,PART FIRST,He turned the eye-ball in his head
972,PART FIRST,Towards the smooth river [44] deep and clear.            440
973,PART FIRST,
974,PART FIRST,Upon the Beast the sapling rings;
975,PART FIRST,"His lank sides heaved, [45] his limbs they stirred;"
976,PART FIRST,"He gave a groan, and then another,"
977,PART FIRST,"Of that which went before the brother,"
978,PART FIRST,And then he gave a third.                                445
979,PART FIRST,
980,PART FIRST,All by the moonlight river side
981,PART FIRST,He gave three miserable groans;
982,PART FIRST,And not till now hath Peter seen
983,PART FIRST,"How gaunt the Creature is,--how lean"
984,PART FIRST,And sharp his staring bones! [46]                         450
985,PART FIRST,
986,PART FIRST,With legs stretched out and stiff he lay:--
987,PART FIRST,No word of kind commiseration
988,PART FIRST,Fell at the sight from Peter's tongue;
989,PART FIRST,"With hard contempt his heart was wrung,"
990,PART FIRST,With hatred and vexation.                                455
991,PART FIRST,
992,PART FIRST,The meagre beast lay still as death;
993,PART FIRST,And Peter's lips with fury quiver;
994,PART FIRST,"Quoth he, ""You little mulish dog,"
995,PART FIRST,I'll fling your carcass like a log
996,PART FIRST,"Head-foremost down the river!""                           460"
997,PART FIRST,
998,PART FIRST,An impious oath confirmed the threat--
999,PART FIRST,Whereat from the earth on which he lay [47]
1000,PART FIRST,"To all the echoes, south and north,"
1001,PART FIRST,"And east and west, the Ass sent forth"
1002,PART FIRST,A long and clamorous bray! [48]                          465
1003,PART FIRST,
1004,PART FIRST,"This outcry, on the heart of Peter,"
1005,PART FIRST,"Seems like a note of joy to strike,--"
1006,PART FIRST,Joy at [49] the heart of Peter knocks;
1007,PART FIRST,But in the echo of the rocks
1008,PART FIRST,Was something Peter did not like.                        470
1009,PART FIRST,
1010,PART FIRST,"Whether to cheer his coward breast,"
1011,PART FIRST,"Or that he could not break the chain,"
1012,PART FIRST,"In this serene and solemn hour,"
1013,PART FIRST,"Twined round him by demoniac power,"
1014,PART FIRST,To the blind work he turned again.                       475
1015,PART FIRST,
1016,PART FIRST,Among the rocks and winding crags;
1017,PART FIRST,Among the mountains far away;
1018,PART FIRST,Once more the Ass did lengthen out
1019,PART FIRST,"More ruefully a deep-drawn shout,"
1020,PART FIRST,The hard dry see-saw of his horrible bray! [50]          480
1021,PART FIRST,
1022,PART FIRST,What is there now in Peter's heart!
1023,PART FIRST,Or whence the might of this strange sound?
1024,PART FIRST,"The moon uneasy looked and dimmer,"
1025,PART FIRST,"The broad blue heavens appeared to glimmer,"
1026,PART FIRST,And the rocks staggered all around--485
1027,PART FIRST,
1028,PART FIRST,From Peter's hand the sapling dropped!
1029,PART FIRST,Threat has he none to execute;
1030,PART FIRST,"""If any one should come and see"
1031,PART FIRST,"That I am here, they'll think,"" quoth he,"
1032,PART FIRST,"""I'm helping this poor dying brute.""                     490"
1033,PART FIRST,
1034,PART FIRST,"He scans the Ass from limb to limb,"
1035,PART FIRST,And ventures now to uplift his eyes;
1036,PART FIRST,"More steady looks the moon, and clear,"
1037,PART FIRST,More like themselves the rocks appear
1038,PART FIRST,And touch more quiet skies. [51]                         495
1039,PART FIRST,
1040,PART FIRST,His scorn returns--his hate revives;
1041,PART FIRST,He stoops the Ass's neck to seize
1042,PART FIRST,With malice--that again takes flight;
1043,PART FIRST,For in the pool a startling sight
1044,PART FIRST,"Meets him, among the inverted trees. [52]                500"
1045,PART FIRST,
1046,PART FIRST,Is it the moon's distorted face?
1047,PART FIRST,The ghost-like image of a cloud?
1048,PART FIRST,Is it a gallows [53] there portrayed?
1049,PART FIRST,Is Peter of himself afraid?
1050,PART FIRST,"Is it a coffin,--or a shroud?                            505"
1051,PART FIRST,
1052,PART FIRST,A grisly idol hewn in stone?
1053,PART FIRST,Or imp from witch's lap let fall?
1054,PART FIRST,Perhaps a ring of shining fairies?
1055,PART FIRST,Such as pursue their feared vagaries [54]
1056,PART FIRST,"In sylvan bower, or haunted hall?                        510"
1057,PART FIRST,
1058,PART FIRST,Is it a fiend that to a stake
1059,PART FIRST,Of fire his desperate self is tethering?
1060,PART FIRST,Or stubborn spirit doomed to yell
1061,PART FIRST,"In solitary ward or cell,"
1062,PART FIRST,Ten thousand miles from all his brethren?                515
1063,PART FIRST,
1064,PART FIRST,[55]
1065,PART FIRST,
1066,PART FIRST,"Never did pulse so quickly throb,"
1067,PART FIRST,And never heart so loudly panted; [56]
1068,PART FIRST,"He looks, he cannot choose but look;"
1069,PART FIRST,Like some one reading in a book--[57]
1070,PART FIRST,A book that is enchanted.                                520
1071,PART FIRST,
1072,PART FIRST,"Ah, well-a-day for Peter Bell!"
1073,PART FIRST,"He will be turned to iron soon,"
1074,PART FIRST,Meet Statue for the court of Fear!
1075,PART FIRST,His hat is up--and every hair
1076,PART FIRST,"Bristles, and whitens in the moon!                       525"
1077,PART FIRST,
1078,PART FIRST,"He looks, he ponders, looks again;"
1079,PART FIRST,He sees a motion--hears a groan;
1080,PART FIRST,His eyes will burst--his heart will break--
1081,PART FIRST,"He gives a loud and frightful shriek,"
1082,PART FIRST,"And back he falls, [58] as if his life were flown!       530"
1083,PART FIRST,
1084,PART FIRST,
1085,PART SECOND,PART SECOND
1086,PART SECOND,
1087,PART SECOND,"We left our Hero in a trance,"
1088,PART SECOND,"Beneath the alders, near the river;"
1089,PART SECOND,"The Ass is by the river-side,"
1090,PART SECOND,"And, where the feeble breezes glide,"
1091,PART SECOND,Upon the stream the moonbeams quiver.                    535
1092,PART SECOND,
1093,PART SECOND,A happy respite! but at length
1094,PART SECOND,He feels the glimmering of the moon;
1095,PART SECOND,"Wakes with glazed eye, and feebly sighing--"
1096,PART SECOND,"To sink, perhaps, where he is lying,"
1097,PART SECOND,Into a second swoon! [59]                                540
1098,PART SECOND,
1099,PART SECOND,"He lifts his head, he sees his staff;"
1100,PART SECOND,He touches--'tis to him a treasure!
1101,PART SECOND,Faint recollection seems to tell
1102,PART SECOND,That he is yet where mortals dwell--
1103,PART SECOND,A thought received with languid pleasure!                545
1104,PART SECOND,
1105,PART SECOND,"His head upon his elbow propped,"
1106,PART SECOND,"Becoming less and less perplexed,"
1107,PART SECOND,Sky-ward he looks--to rock and wood--
1108,PART SECOND,And then--upon the glassy [60] flood
1109,PART SECOND,His wandering eye is fixed.                              550
1110,PART SECOND,
1111,PART SECOND,"Thought he, that is the face of one"
1112,PART SECOND,In his last sleep securely bound!
1113,PART SECOND,"So toward the stream his head he bent,"
1114,PART SECOND,"And downward thrust his staff, intent"
1115,PART SECOND,The river's depth to sound. [61]                         555
1116,PART SECOND,
1117,PART SECOND,"_Now_--like a tempest-shattered bark,"
1118,PART SECOND,"That overwhelmed and prostrate lies,"
1119,PART SECOND,And in a moment to the verge
1120,PART SECOND,Is lifted of a foaming surge--
1121,PART SECOND,Full suddenly the Ass doth rise!                         560
1122,PART SECOND,
1123,PART SECOND,"His staring bones all shake with joy,"
1124,PART SECOND,And close by Peter's side he stands:
1125,PART SECOND,"While Peter o'er the river bends,"
1126,PART SECOND,"The little Ass his neck extends,"
1127,PART SECOND,And fondly licks his hands.                              565
1128,PART SECOND,
1129,PART SECOND,"Such life is in the Ass's eyes,"
1130,PART SECOND,Such life is in his limbs and ears;
1131,PART SECOND,"That Peter Bell, if he had been"
1132,PART SECOND,"The veriest coward ever seen,"
1133,PART SECOND,Must now have thrown aside his fears.                    570
1134,PART SECOND,
1135,PART SECOND,The Ass looks on--and to his work
1136,PART SECOND,Is Peter quietly resigned;
1137,PART SECOND,He touches here--he touches there--
1138,PART SECOND,And now among the dead man's hair
1139,PART SECOND,His sapling Peter has entwined.                          575
1140,PART SECOND,
1141,PART SECOND,He pulls--and looks--and pulls again;
1142,PART SECOND,"And he whom the poor Ass had lost,"
1143,PART SECOND,"The man who had been four days dead,"
1144,PART SECOND,Head-foremost from the river's bed
1145,PART SECOND,Uprises like a ghost! [G]                                580
1146,PART SECOND,
1147,PART SECOND,And Peter draws him to dry land;
1148,PART SECOND,And through the brain of Peter pass
1149,PART SECOND,"Some poignant twitches, fast and faster;"
1150,PART SECOND,"""No doubt,"" quoth he, ""he is the Master"
1151,PART SECOND,"Of this poor miserable Ass!""                             585"
1152,PART SECOND,
1153,PART SECOND,The meagre shadow that looks on--
1154,PART SECOND,What would he now? [62] what is he doing?
1155,PART SECOND,"His sudden fit of joy is flown,--"
1156,PART SECOND,"He on his knees hath laid him down,"
1157,PART SECOND,As if he were his grief renewing;                        590
1158,PART SECOND,
1159,PART SECOND,But no--that Peter on his back
1160,PART SECOND,"Must mount, he shows well as he can: [63]"
1161,PART SECOND,"Thought Peter then, come weal or woe"
1162,PART SECOND,"I'll do what he would have me do,"
1163,PART SECOND,In pity to this poor drowned man.                        595
1164,PART SECOND,
1165,PART SECOND,With that resolve he boldly mounts [64]
1166,PART SECOND,Upon the pleased and thankful Ass;
1167,PART SECOND,"And then, without a moment's stay,"
1168,PART SECOND,"That [65] earnest Creature turned away,"
1169,PART SECOND,Leaving the body on the grass.                           600
1170,PART SECOND,
1171,PART SECOND,"Intent upon his faithful watch,"
1172,PART SECOND,The Beast four days and nights had past;
1173,PART SECOND,"A sweeter meadow ne'er was seen,"
1174,PART SECOND,"And there the Ass four days had been,"
1175,PART SECOND,Nor ever once did break his fast:                        605
1176,PART SECOND,
1177,PART SECOND,"Yet firm his step, and stout his heart;"
1178,PART SECOND,The mead is crossed--the quarry's mouth
1179,PART SECOND,Is reached; but there the trusty guide
1180,PART SECOND,"Into a thicket turns aside,"
1181,PART SECOND,And deftly ambles [66] towards the south.                610
1182,PART SECOND,
1183,PART SECOND,When hark a burst of doleful sound!
1184,PART SECOND,"And Peter honestly might say,"
1185,PART SECOND,"The like came never to his ears,"
1186,PART SECOND,"Though he has been, full thirty years,"
1187,PART SECOND,A rover--night and day!                                  615
1188,PART SECOND,
1189,PART SECOND,"'Tis not a plover of the moors,"
1190,PART SECOND,'Tis not a bittern of the fen;
1191,PART SECOND,"Nor can it be a barking fox,"
1192,PART SECOND,"Nor night-bird chambered in the rocks,"
1193,PART SECOND,Nor wild-cat in a woody glen!                            620
1194,PART SECOND,
1195,PART SECOND,The Ass is startled--and stops short
1196,PART SECOND,Right in the middle of the thicket;
1197,PART SECOND,"And Peter, wont to whistle loud"
1198,PART SECOND,"Whether alone or in a crowd,"
1199,PART SECOND,Is silent as a silent cricket.                           625
1200,PART SECOND,
1201,PART SECOND,"What ails you now, my little Bess?"
1202,PART SECOND,Well may you tremble and look grave!
1203,PART SECOND,"This cry--that rings along the wood,"
1204,PART SECOND,"This cry--that floats adown the flood,"
1205,PART SECOND,Comes from the entrance of a cave:                       630
1206,PART SECOND,
1207,PART SECOND,"I see a blooming Wood-boy there,"
1208,PART SECOND,And if I had the power to say
1209,PART SECOND,"How sorrowful the wanderer is,"
1210,PART SECOND,Your heart would be as sad as his
1211,PART SECOND,Till you had kissed his tears away!                      635
1212,PART SECOND,
1213,PART SECOND,"Grasping [67] a hawthorn branch in hand,"
1214,PART SECOND,"All bright with berries ripe and red,"
1215,PART SECOND,Into the cavern's mouth he peeps;
1216,PART SECOND,Thence back into the moonlight creeps;
1217,PART SECOND,Whom seeks he--whom?--the silent dead: [68]              640
1218,PART SECOND,
1219,PART SECOND,His father!--Him doth he require--
1220,PART SECOND,"Him hath he sought [69] with fruitless pains,"
1221,PART SECOND,"Among the rocks, behind the trees;"
1222,PART SECOND,"Now creeping on his hands and knees,"
1223,PART SECOND,Now running o'er the open plains.                        645
1224,PART SECOND,
1225,PART SECOND,"And hither is he come at last,"
1226,PART SECOND,"When he through such a day has gone,"
1227,PART SECOND,By this dark cave to be distrest
1228,PART SECOND,Like a poor bird--her plundered nest
1229,PART SECOND,Hovering around with dolorous moan!                      650
1230,PART SECOND,
1231,PART SECOND,Of that intense and piercing cry
1232,PART SECOND,The listening Ass conjectures well; [70]
1233,PART SECOND,"Wild as it is, he there can read"
1234,PART SECOND,Some intermingled notes that plead
1235,PART SECOND,With touches irresistible.                               655
1236,PART SECOND,
1237,PART SECOND,But Peter--when he saw the Ass
1238,PART SECOND,"Not only stop but turn, and change"
1239,PART SECOND,The cherished tenor of his pace
1240,PART SECOND,That lamentable cry [71] to chase--
1241,PART SECOND,It wrought in him conviction strange;                    660
1242,PART SECOND,
1243,PART SECOND,"A faith that, for the dead man's sake"
1244,PART SECOND,"And this poor slave who loved him well,"
1245,PART SECOND,"Vengeance upon his head will fall,"
1246,PART SECOND,Some visitation worse than all
1247,PART SECOND,Which ever till this night befel.                        665
1248,PART SECOND,
1249,PART SECOND,"Meanwhile the Ass to reach his home, [72]"
1250,PART SECOND,Is striving stoutly as he may;
1251,PART SECOND,"But, while he climbs the woody hill,"
1252,PART SECOND,The cry grows weak--and weaker still;
1253,PART SECOND,And now at last it dies away.                            670
1254,PART SECOND,
1255,PART SECOND,So with his freight the Creature turns
1256,PART SECOND,"Into a gloomy grove of beech,"
1257,PART SECOND,Along the shade with footsteps [73] true
1258,PART SECOND,"Descending slowly, till the two"
1259,PART SECOND,The open moonlight reach.                                675
1260,PART SECOND,
1261,PART SECOND,"And there, along the [74] narrow dell,"
1262,PART SECOND,"A fair smooth pathway you discern,"
1263,PART SECOND,A length of green and open road--
1264,PART SECOND,As if it from a fountain flowed--
1265,PART SECOND,Winding away between the fern.                           680
1266,PART SECOND,
1267,PART SECOND,The rocks that tower on either side
1268,PART SECOND,Build up a wild fantastic scene;
1269,PART SECOND,"Temples like those among the Hindoos,"
1270,PART SECOND,"And mosques, and spires, and abbey-windows,"
1271,PART SECOND,And castles all with ivy green!                          685
1272,PART SECOND,
1273,PART SECOND,"And, while the Ass pursues his way,"
1274,PART SECOND,"Along this solitary dell,"
1275,PART SECOND,"As pensively his steps advance,"
1276,PART SECOND,"The mosques and spires change countenance,"
1277,PART SECOND,And look at Peter Bell!                                  690
1278,PART SECOND,
1279,PART SECOND,That unintelligible cry
1280,PART SECOND,"Hath left him high in preparation,--"
1281,PART SECOND,"Convinced that he, or soon or late,"
1282,PART SECOND,This very night will meet his fate--
1283,PART SECOND,And so he sits in expectation!                           695
1284,PART SECOND,
1285,PART SECOND,[75]
1286,PART SECOND,
1287,PART SECOND,The strenuous Animal hath clomb
1288,PART SECOND,With the green path; and now he wends
1289,PART SECOND,"Where, shining like the smoothest sea,"
1290,PART SECOND,In undisturbed immensity
1291,PART SECOND,A [76] level plain extends.                              700
1292,PART SECOND,
1293,PART SECOND,But whence this faintly-rustling sound
1294,PART SECOND,By which the journeying pair are chased?
1295,PART SECOND,"--A withered leaf is close behind, [77]"
1296,PART SECOND,Light plaything for the sportive wind
1297,PART SECOND,Upon that solitary waste.                                705
1298,PART SECOND,
1299,PART SECOND,"When Peter spied the moving thing,"
1300,PART SECOND,It only doubled his distress; [78]
1301,PART SECOND,"""Where there is not a bush or tree,"
1302,PART SECOND,The very leaves they follow me--
1303,PART SECOND,"So huge hath been my wickedness!""                        710"
1304,PART SECOND,
1305,PART SECOND,"To a close lane they now are come,"
1306,PART SECOND,"Where, as before, the enduring Ass"
1307,PART SECOND,"Moves on without a moment's stop,"
1308,PART SECOND,Nor once turns round his head to crop
1309,PART SECOND,A bramble-leaf or blade of grass.                        715
1310,PART SECOND,
1311,PART SECOND,"Between the hedges as they go,"
1312,PART SECOND,The white dust sleeps upon the lane;
1313,PART SECOND,"And Peter, ever and anon"
1314,PART SECOND,"Back-looking, sees, upon a stone,"
1315,PART SECOND,"Or in the dust, a crimson stain.                         720"
1316,PART SECOND,
1317,PART SECOND,A stain--as of a drop of blood
1318,PART SECOND,By moonlight made more faint and wan;
1319,PART SECOND,Ha! why these sinkings of despair? [79]
1320,PART SECOND,He knows not how the blood comes there--
1321,PART SECOND,And Peter is a wicked man.                               725
1322,PART SECOND,
1323,PART SECOND,"At length he spies a bleeding wound,"
1324,PART SECOND,Where he had struck the Ass's head; [80]
1325,PART SECOND,"He sees the blood, knows what it is,--"
1326,PART SECOND,"A glimpse of sudden joy was his,"
1327,PART SECOND,But then it quickly fled;                                730
1328,PART SECOND,
1329,PART SECOND,Of him whom sudden death had seized
1330,PART SECOND,"He thought,--of thee, O faithful Ass!"
1331,PART SECOND,"And once again those ghastly pains,"
1332,PART SECOND,"Shoot to and fro through heart and reins,"
1333,PART SECOND,And through his brain like lightning pass. [81]          735
1334,PART SECOND,
1335,PART SECOND,
1336,PART THIRD,PART THIRD
1337,PART THIRD,
1338,PART THIRD,"I've heard of one, a gentle Soul,"
1339,PART THIRD,"Though given to sadness and to gloom,"
1340,PART THIRD,"And for the fact will vouch,--one night"
1341,PART THIRD,It chanced that by a taper's light
1342,PART THIRD,This man was reading in his room;                        740
1343,PART THIRD,
1344,PART THIRD,"Bending, as you or I might bend"
1345,PART THIRD,"At night o'er any pious book, [82]"
1346,PART THIRD,When sudden blackness overspread
1347,PART THIRD,"The snow white page on which he read,"
1348,PART THIRD,And made the good man round him look.                    745
1349,PART THIRD,
1350,PART THIRD,"The chamber walls were dark all round,--"
1351,PART THIRD,And to his book he turned again;
1352,PART THIRD,"--The light had left the lonely taper, [83]"
1353,PART THIRD,And formed itself upon the paper
1354,PART THIRD,Into large letters--bright and plain!                    750
1355,PART THIRD,
1356,PART THIRD,The godly book was in his hand--
1357,PART THIRD,"And, on the page, more black than coal,"
1358,PART THIRD,"Appeared, set forth in strange array,"
1359,PART THIRD,A _word_--which to his dying day
1360,PART THIRD,Perplexed the good man's gentle soul.                    755
1361,PART THIRD,
1362,PART THIRD,"The ghostly word, thus plainly seen, [84]"
1363,PART THIRD,Did never from his lips depart;
1364,PART THIRD,"But he hath said, poor gentle wight!"
1365,PART THIRD,It brought full many a sin to light
1366,PART THIRD,Out of the bottom of his heart.                          760
1367,PART THIRD,
1368,PART THIRD,Dread Spirits! to confound the meek [85]
1369,PART THIRD,"Why wander from your course so far,"
1370,PART THIRD,"Disordering colour, form, and stature!"
1371,PART THIRD,"--Let good men feel the soul of nature,"
1372,PART THIRD,And see things as they are.                              765
1373,PART THIRD,
1374,PART THIRD,"Yet, potent Spirits! well I know,"
1375,PART THIRD,"How ye, that play with soul and sense,"
1376,PART THIRD,Are not unused to trouble friends
1377,PART THIRD,"Of goodness, for most gracious ends--[86]"
1378,PART THIRD,And this I speak in reverence!                           770
1379,PART THIRD,
1380,PART THIRD,"But might I give advice to you,"
1381,PART THIRD,Whom in my fear I love so well;
1382,PART THIRD,"From men of pensive virtue go,"
1383,PART THIRD,Dread Beings! and your empire show
1384,PART THIRD,On hearts like that of Peter Bell.                       775
1385,PART THIRD,
1386,PART THIRD,Your presence often have I [87] felt
1387,PART THIRD,In darkness and the stormy night;
1388,PART THIRD,"And, with like force, [88] if need there be,"
1389,PART THIRD,Ye can put forth your agency
1390,PART THIRD,"When earth is calm, and heaven is bright.                780"
1391,PART THIRD,
1392,PART THIRD,"Then, coming from the wayward world,"
1393,PART THIRD,"That powerful world in which ye dwell,"
1394,PART THIRD,"Come, Spirits of the Mind! and try,"
1395,PART THIRD,"To-night, beneath the moonlight sky,"
1396,PART THIRD,What may be done with Peter Bell!                        785
1397,PART THIRD,
1398,PART THIRD,"--O, would that some more skilful voice"
1399,PART THIRD,My further labour might prevent!
1400,PART THIRD,"Kind Listeners, that around me sit,"
1401,PART THIRD,I feel that I am all unfit
1402,PART THIRD,For such high argument.                                  790
1403,PART THIRD,
1404,PART THIRD,"I've played, I've danced, [89] with my narration;"
1405,PART THIRD,I loitered long ere I began:
1406,PART THIRD,Ye waited then on my good pleasure;
1407,PART THIRD,"Pour out indulgence still, in measure"
1408,PART THIRD,As liberal as ye can!                                    795
1409,PART THIRD,
1410,PART THIRD,"Our Travellers, ye remember well,"
1411,PART THIRD,Are thridding a sequestered lane;
1412,PART THIRD,"And Peter many tricks is trying,"
1413,PART THIRD,"And many anodynes applying,"
1414,PART THIRD,To ease his conscience of its pain.                      800
1415,PART THIRD,
1416,PART THIRD,By this his heart is lighter far;
1417,PART THIRD,"And, finding that he can account"
1418,PART THIRD,"So snugly [90] for that crimson stain,"
1419,PART THIRD,His evil spirit up again
1420,PART THIRD,Does like an empty bucket mount.                         805
1421,PART THIRD,
1422,PART THIRD,And Peter is a deep logician
1423,PART THIRD,Who hath no lack of wit mercurial;
1424,PART THIRD,"""Blood drops--leaves rustle--yet,"" quoth he,"
1425,PART THIRD,"""This poor man never, but for me,"
1426,PART THIRD,Could have had Christian burial.                         810
1427,PART THIRD,
1428,PART THIRD,"""And, say the best you can, 'tis plain,"
1429,PART THIRD,That here has [91] been some wicked dealing;
1430,PART THIRD,No doubt the devil in me wrought;
1431,PART THIRD,I'm not the man who could have thought
1432,PART THIRD,"An Ass like this was worth the stealing!""                815"
1433,PART THIRD,
1434,PART THIRD,So from his pocket Peter takes
1435,PART THIRD,His shining horn tobacco-box;
1436,PART THIRD,"And, in a light and careless way,"
1437,PART THIRD,"As men who with their purpose play,"
1438,PART THIRD,Upon the lid he knocks.                                  820
1439,PART THIRD,
1440,PART THIRD,"Let them whose voice can stop the clouds,"
1441,PART THIRD,"Whose cunning eye can see the wind,"
1442,PART THIRD,Tell to a curious world the cause
1443,PART THIRD,"Why, making here a sudden pause,"
1444,PART THIRD,"The Ass turned round his head, and _grinned_.            825"
1445,PART THIRD,
1446,PART THIRD,Appalling process! I have marked
1447,PART THIRD,"The like on heath, in lonely wood;"
1448,PART THIRD,"And, verily, have seldom met"
1449,PART THIRD,A spectacle more hideous--yet
1450,PART THIRD,It suited Peter's present mood.                          830
1451,PART THIRD,
1452,PART THIRD,"And, grinning in his turn, his teeth"
1453,PART THIRD,He in jocose defiance showed--
1454,PART THIRD,"When, to upset [92] his spiteful mirth,"
1455,PART THIRD,"A murmur, pent within the earth,"
1456,PART THIRD,"In the dead earth beneath the road,                      835"
1457,PART THIRD,
1458,PART THIRD,"Rolled audibly! it swept along,"
1459,PART THIRD,A muffled noise--a rumbling sound!--
1460,PART THIRD,"'Twas by a troop of miners made,"
1461,PART THIRD,"Plying with gunpowder their trade,"
1462,PART THIRD,Some twenty fathoms underground.                         840
1463,PART THIRD,
1464,PART THIRD,"Small cause of dire effect! for, surely,"
1465,PART THIRD,"If ever mortal, King or Cotter,"
1466,PART THIRD,Believed that earth was charged to quake
1467,PART THIRD,"And yawn for his unworthy sake,"
1468,PART THIRD,'Twas Peter Bell the Potter.                             845
1469,PART THIRD,
1470,PART THIRD,"But, as an oak in breathless air"
1471,PART THIRD,Will stand though to the centre hewn;
1472,PART THIRD,"Or as the weakest things, if frost"
1473,PART THIRD,"Have stiffened them, maintain their post;"
1474,PART THIRD,"So he, beneath the gazing moon!--850"
1475,PART THIRD,
1476,PART THIRD,"The Beast bestriding thus, he reached"
1477,PART THIRD,"A spot where, in a sheltering cove, [93]"
1478,PART THIRD,"A little chapel stands alone,"
1479,PART THIRD,"With greenest ivy overgrown,"
1480,PART THIRD,And tufted with an ivy grove;                            855
1481,PART THIRD,
1482,PART THIRD,Dying insensibly away
1483,PART THIRD,"From human thoughts and purposes,"
1484,PART THIRD,"It seemed--wall, window, roof and tower [94]--"
1485,PART THIRD,"To bow to some transforming power,"
1486,PART THIRD,And blend with the surrounding trees.                    860
1487,PART THIRD,
1488,PART THIRD,"As ruinous a place it was,"
1489,PART THIRD,"Thought Peter, in the shire of Fife"
1490,PART THIRD,"That served my turn, when following still"
1491,PART THIRD,From land to land a reckless will [95]
1492,PART THIRD,I married my sixth wife!                                 865
1493,PART THIRD,
1494,PART THIRD,"The unheeding Ass moves slowly on,"
1495,PART THIRD,And now is passing by an inn
1496,PART THIRD,"Brim-full of a carousing crew,"
1497,PART THIRD,"That make, [96] with curses not a few,"
1498,PART THIRD,An uproar and a drunken din.                             870
1499,PART THIRD,
1500,PART THIRD,I cannot well express the thoughts
1501,PART THIRD,Which Peter in those noises found;--
1502,PART THIRD,"A stifling power compressed his frame,"
1503,PART THIRD,While-as a swimming darkness came [97]
1504,PART THIRD,Over that dull and dreary sound.                         875
1505,PART THIRD,
1506,PART THIRD,For well did Peter know the sound;
1507,PART THIRD,The language of those drunken joys
1508,PART THIRD,"To him, a jovial soul, I ween,"
1509,PART THIRD,"But a few hours ago, had been"
1510,PART THIRD,A gladsome and a welcome noise.                          880
1511,PART THIRD,
1512,PART THIRD,"_Now_, [98] turned adrift into the past,"
1513,PART THIRD,He finds no solace in his course;
1514,PART THIRD,"Like planet-stricken men of yore,"
1515,PART THIRD,"He trembles, smitten to the core"
1516,PART THIRD,By strong compunction and remorse.                       885
1517,PART THIRD,
1518,PART THIRD,"But, more than all, his heart is stung"
1519,PART THIRD,"To think of one, almost a child;"
1520,PART THIRD,"A sweet and playful Highland girl,"
1521,PART THIRD,"As light and beauteous as a squirrel,"
1522,PART THIRD,As beauteous and as wild!                                890
1523,PART THIRD,
1524,PART THIRD,"Her dwelling was a lonely house, [99]"
1525,PART THIRD,A cottage in a heathy dell;
1526,PART THIRD,"And she put on her gown of green,"
1527,PART THIRD,"And left her mother at sixteen,"
1528,PART THIRD,And followed Peter Bell.                                 895
1529,PART THIRD,
1530,PART THIRD,But many good and pious thoughts
1531,PART THIRD,"Had she; and, in the kirk to pray,"
1532,PART THIRD,"Two long Scotch miles, through rain or snow,"
1533,PART THIRD,"To kirk she had been used to go,"
1534,PART THIRD,Twice every Sabbath-day.                                 900
1535,PART THIRD,
1536,PART THIRD,"And, when she followed Peter Bell,"
1537,PART THIRD,It was to lead an honest life;
1538,PART THIRD,"For he, with tongue not used to falter,"
1539,PART THIRD,Had pledged his troth before the altar
1540,PART THIRD,To love her as his wedded wife.                          905
1541,PART THIRD,
1542,PART THIRD,A mother's hope is hers;--but soon
1543,PART THIRD,She drooped and pined like one forlorn;
1544,PART THIRD,From Scripture she a name [100] did borrow;
1545,PART THIRD,"Benoni, or the child of sorrow,"
1546,PART THIRD,She called her babe unborn.                              910
1547,PART THIRD,
1548,PART THIRD,"For she had learned how Peter lived,"
1549,PART THIRD,And took it in most grievous part;
1550,PART THIRD,"She to the very bone was worn,"
1551,PART THIRD,"And, ere that little child was born,"
1552,PART THIRD,Died of a broken heart.                                  915
1553,PART THIRD,
1554,PART THIRD,And now the Spirits of the Mind
1555,PART THIRD,Are busy with poor Peter Bell;
1556,PART THIRD,Upon the rights of visual sense
1557,PART THIRD,"Usurping, with a prevalence"
1558,PART THIRD,More terrible than magic spell. [101]                    920
1559,PART THIRD,
1560,PART THIRD,Close by a brake of flowering furze
1561,PART THIRD,(Above it shivering aspens play)
1562,PART THIRD,"He sees an unsubstantial creature,"
1563,PART THIRD,"His very self in form and feature,"
1564,PART THIRD,Not four yards from the broad highway:                   925
1565,PART THIRD,
1566,PART THIRD,And stretched beneath the furze he sees
1567,PART THIRD,The Highland girl--it is no other;
1568,PART THIRD,"And hears her crying as she cried,"
1569,PART THIRD,"The very moment that she died,"
1570,PART THIRD,"""My mother! oh my mother!""                               930"
1571,PART THIRD,
1572,PART THIRD,"The sweat pours down from Peter's face,"
1573,PART THIRD,So grievous is his heart's contrition;
1574,PART THIRD,With agony his eye-balls ache
1575,PART THIRD,While he beholds by the furze-brake
1576,PART THIRD,This miserable vision!                                   935
1577,PART THIRD,
1578,PART THIRD,"Calm is the well-deserving brute,"
1579,PART THIRD,_His_ peace hath no offence betrayed;
1580,PART THIRD,"But now, while down that slope he wends,"
1581,PART THIRD,"A voice to Peter's ear [102] ascends,"
1582,PART THIRD,Resounding from the woody glade:                         940
1583,PART THIRD,
1584,PART THIRD,"The voice, though clamorous as a horn"
1585,PART THIRD,"Re-echoed by a naked rock,"
1586,PART THIRD,Comes from that tabernacle--List! [103]
1587,PART THIRD,"Within, a fervent [104] Methodist"
1588,PART THIRD,Is preaching to no heedless flock!                       945
1589,PART THIRD,
1590,PART THIRD,"""Repent! repent!"" he cries aloud,"
1591,PART THIRD,"""While yet ye may find mercy;--strive"
1592,PART THIRD,To love the Lord with all your might;

1595,PART THIRD,
1596,PART THIRD,"""Repent! repent! though ye have gone,"
1597,PART THIRD,"Through paths of wickedness and woe,"
1598,PART THIRD,After the Babylonian harlot;
1599,PART THIRD,"And, though your sins be red as scarlet,"
1600,PART THIRD,"They shall be white as snow!""                            955"
1601,PART THIRD,
1602,PART THIRD,"Even as he passed the door, these words"
1603,PART THIRD,Did plainly come to Peter's ears;
1604,PART THIRD,"And they such joyful tidings were,"
1605,PART THIRD,The joy was more than he could bear!--
1606,PART THIRD,He melted into tears.                                    960
1607,PART THIRD,
1608,PART THIRD,Sweet tears of hope and tenderness!
1609,PART THIRD,"And fast they fell, a plenteous shower!"
1610,PART THIRD,"His nerves, his sinews seemed to melt;"
1611,PART THIRD,Through all his iron frame was felt
1612,PART THIRD,"A gentle, a relaxing, power!                             965"
1613,PART THIRD,
1614,PART THIRD,Each fibre of his frame was weak;
1615,PART THIRD,Weak all the animal within;
1616,PART THIRD,"But, in its helplessness, grew mild"
1617,PART THIRD,"And gentle as an infant child,"
1618,PART THIRD,An infant that has known no sin.                         970
1619,PART THIRD,
1620,PART THIRD,"'Tis said, meek Beast! that, through Heaven's grace,[105] [H]"
1621,PART THIRD,He not unmoved did notice now
1622,PART THIRD,"The cross [I] upon thy shoulder scored,"
1623,PART THIRD,"For lasting impress, by the Lord [106]"
1624,PART THIRD,To whom all human-kind shall bow;                        975
1625,PART THIRD,
1626,PART THIRD,Memorial of his touch--that day [107]
1627,PART THIRD,"When Jesus humbly deigned to ride,"
1628,PART THIRD,"Entering the proud Jerusalem,"
1629,PART THIRD,By an immeasurable stream [J]
1630,PART THIRD,Of shouting people deified!                              980
1631,PART THIRD,
1632,PART THIRD,"Meanwhile the persevering Ass,"
1633,PART THIRD,Turned towards a gate that hung in view
1634,PART THIRD,Across a shady lane; [108] his chest
1635,PART THIRD,Against the yielding gate he pressed
1636,PART THIRD,And quietly passed through.                              985
1637,PART THIRD,
1638,PART THIRD,And up the stony lane he goes;
1639,PART THIRD,No ghost more softly ever trod;
1640,PART THIRD,"Among the stones and pebbles, he"
1641,PART THIRD,"Sets down his hoofs inaudibly,"
1642,PART THIRD,As if with felt his hoofs were shod.                     990
1643,PART THIRD,
1644,PART THIRD,Along the lane the trusty Ass
1645,PART THIRD,"Went twice two hundred yards or more,"
1646,PART THIRD,"And no one could have guessed his aim,--"
1647,PART THIRD,"Till to a lonely house he came,"
1648,PART THIRD,And stopped beside the door. [109]                       995
1649,PART THIRD,
1650,PART THIRD,"Thought Peter, 'tis the poor man's home!"
1651,PART THIRD,He listens--not a sound is heard
1652,PART THIRD,Save from the trickling household rill;
1653,PART THIRD,"But, stepping o'er the cottage-sill,"
1654,PART THIRD,Forthwith a little Girl appeared.                       1000
1655,PART THIRD,
1656,PART THIRD,She to the Meeting-house was bound
1657,PART THIRD,In hopes [110] some tidings there to gather:
1658,PART THIRD,"No glimpse it is, no doubtful gleam;"
1659,PART THIRD,"She saw--and uttered with a scream,"
1660,PART THIRD,"""My father! here's my father!""                          1005"
1661,PART THIRD,
1662,PART THIRD,"The very word was plainly heard,"
1663,PART THIRD,Heard plainly by the wretched Mother--
1664,PART THIRD,Her joy was like a deep affright:
1665,PART THIRD,"And forth she rushed into the light,"
1666,PART THIRD,And saw it was another!                                 1010
1667,PART THIRD,
1668,PART THIRD,"And, instantly, upon the earth,"
1669,PART THIRD,"Beneath the full moon shining bright,"
1670,PART THIRD,Close to [111] the Ass's feet she fell;
1671,PART THIRD,At the same moment Peter Bell
1672,PART THIRD,Dismounts in most unhappy plight.                       1015
1673,PART THIRD,
1674,PART THIRD,As he beheld the Woman lie [112]
1675,PART THIRD,"Breathless and motionless, the mind"
1676,PART THIRD,Of Peter sadly was confused;
1677,PART THIRD,"But, though to such demands unused,"
1678,PART THIRD,"And helpless almost as the blind,                       1020"
1679,PART THIRD,
1680,PART THIRD,"He raised her up; and, while he held"
1681,PART THIRD,"Her body propped against his knee,"
1682,PART THIRD,The Woman waked--and when she spied
1683,PART THIRD,"The poor Ass standing by her side,"
1684,PART THIRD,She moaned most bitterly.                               1025
1685,PART THIRD,
1686,PART THIRD,"""Oh! God be praised--my heart's at ease--"
1687,PART THIRD,"For he is dead--I know it well!"""
1688,PART THIRD,--At this she wept a bitter flood;
1689,PART THIRD,"And, in the best way that he could,"
1690,PART THIRD,His tale did Peter tell.                                1030
1691,PART THIRD,
1692,PART THIRD,He trembles--he is pale as death;
1693,PART THIRD,His voice is weak with perturbation;
1694,PART THIRD,"He turns aside his head, he pauses;"
1695,PART THIRD,"Poor Peter from a thousand causes,"
1696,PART THIRD,Is crippled sore in his narration.                      1035
1697,PART THIRD,
1698,PART THIRD,At length she learned how he espied
1699,PART THIRD,The Ass in that small meadow-ground;
1700,PART THIRD,"And that her Husband now lay dead,"
1701,PART THIRD,Beside that luckless river's bed
1702,PART THIRD,In which he had been drowned.                           1040
1703,PART THIRD,
1704,PART THIRD,A piercing look the Widow [113] cast
1705,PART THIRD,Upon the Beast that near her stands;
1706,PART THIRD,"She sees 'tis he, that 'tis the same;"
1707,PART THIRD,"She calls the poor Ass by his name,"
1708,PART THIRD,"And wrings, and wrings her hands.                       1045"
1709,PART THIRD,
1710,PART THIRD,"""O wretched loss--untimely stroke!"
1711,PART THIRD,If he had died upon his bed!
1712,PART THIRD,He knew not one forewarning pain;
1713,PART THIRD,He never will come home again--
1714,PART THIRD,"Is dead, for ever dead!""                                1050"
1715,PART THIRD,
1716,PART THIRD,Beside the Woman Peter stands;
1717,PART THIRD,His heart is opening more and more;
1718,PART THIRD,A holy sense pervades his mind;
1719,PART THIRD,He feels what he for human-kind
1720,PART THIRD,Had never felt before.                                  1055
1721,PART THIRD,
1722,PART THIRD,"At length, by Peter's arm sustained,"
1723,PART THIRD,The Woman rises from the ground--
1724,PART THIRD,"""Oh, mercy! something must be done,"
1725,PART THIRD,"My little Rachel, you must run,--"
1726,PART THIRD,Some willing neighbour must be found.                   1060
1727,PART THIRD,
1728,PART THIRD,"""Make haste--my little Rachel--do,"
1729,PART THIRD,"The first you meet with--bid him come,"
1730,PART THIRD,"Ask him to lend his horse to-night,"
1731,PART THIRD,"And this good Man, whom Heaven requite,"
1732,PART THIRD,"Will help to bring the body home.""                      1065"
1733,PART THIRD,
1734,PART THIRD,Away goes Rachel weeping loud;--
1735,PART THIRD,"An Infant, waked by her distress,"
1736,PART THIRD,Makes in the house a piteous cry;
1737,PART THIRD,"And Peter hears the Mother sigh,"
1738,PART THIRD,"""Seven are they, and all fatherless!""                   1070"
1739,PART THIRD,
1740,PART THIRD,And now is Peter taught to feel
1741,PART THIRD,That man's heart is a holy thing;
1742,PART THIRD,"And Nature, through a world of death,"
1743,PART THIRD,"Breathes into him a second breath,"
1744,PART THIRD,More searching than the breath of spring.               1075
1745,PART THIRD,
1746,PART THIRD,Upon a stone the Woman sits
1747,PART THIRD,In agony of silent grief--
1748,PART THIRD,From his own thoughts did Peter start;
1749,PART THIRD,"He longs to press her to his heart,"
1750,PART THIRD,From love that cannot find relief.                      1080
1751,PART THIRD,
1752,PART THIRD,"But roused, as if through every limb"
1753,PART THIRD,"Had past a sudden shock of dread,"
1754,PART THIRD,"The Mother o'er the threshold flies,"
1755,PART THIRD,"And up the cottage stairs [114] she hies,"
1756,PART THIRD,And on the pillow lays [115] her burning head.          1085
1757,PART THIRD,
1758,PART THIRD,And Peter turns his steps aside
1759,PART THIRD,"Into a shade of darksome trees,"
1760,PART THIRD,"Where he sits down, he knows not how,"
1761,PART THIRD,"With his hands pressed against his brow,"
1762,PART THIRD,His elbows on [116] his tremulous knees.                1090
1763,PART THIRD,
1764,PART THIRD,"There, self-involved, does Peter sit"
1765,PART THIRD,"Until no sign of life he makes,"
1766,PART THIRD,As if his mind were sinking deep
1767,PART THIRD,Through years that have been long asleep!
1768,PART THIRD,The trance is passed away--he wakes;                    1095
1769,PART THIRD,
1770,PART THIRD,He lifts [117] his head--and sees the Ass
1771,PART THIRD,Yet standing in the clear moonshine;
1772,PART THIRD,"""When shall I be as good as thou?"
1773,PART THIRD,"Oh! would, poor beast, that I had now"
1774,PART THIRD,"A heart but half as good as thine!""                     1100"
1775,PART THIRD,
1776,PART THIRD,But _He_--who deviously hath sought
1777,PART THIRD,"His Father through the lonesome woods,"
1778,PART THIRD,"Hath sought, proclaiming to the ear"
1779,PART THIRD,Of night his grief and sorrowful fear--[118]
1780,PART THIRD,"He comes, escaped from fields and floods;--1105"
1781,PART THIRD,
1782,PART THIRD,With weary pace is drawing nigh;
1783,PART THIRD,He sees the Ass--and nothing living
1784,PART THIRD,Had ever such a fit of joy
1785,PART THIRD,"As hath [119] this little orphan Boy,"
1786,PART THIRD,For he has no misgiving!                                1110
1787,PART THIRD,
1788,PART THIRD,"Forth to [120] the gentle Ass he springs,"
1789,PART THIRD,And up about his neck he climbs;
1790,PART THIRD,"In loving words he talks to him,"
1791,PART THIRD,"He kisses, kisses face and limb,--"
1792,PART THIRD,He kisses him a thousand times!                         1115
1793,PART THIRD,
1794,PART THIRD,"This Peter sees, while in the shade"
1795,PART THIRD,He stood beside the cottage-door;
1796,PART THIRD,"And Peter Bell, the ruffian wild,"
1797,PART THIRD,"Sobs loud, he sobs even like a child,"
1798,PART THIRD,"""Oh! God, I can endure no more!""                        1120"
1799,PART THIRD,
1800,PART THIRD,--Here ends my Tale: for in a trice
1801,PART THIRD,Arrived a neighbour with his horse;
1802,PART THIRD,Peter went forth with him straightway;
1803,PART THIRD,"And, with due care, ere break of day,"
1804,PART THIRD,Together they brought back the Corse.                   1125
1805,PART THIRD,
1806,PART THIRD,"And many years did this poor Ass,"
1807,PART THIRD,Whom once it was my luck to see
1808,PART THIRD,"Cropping the shrubs of Leming-Lane,"
1809,PART THIRD,Help by his labour to maintain
1810,PART THIRD,The Widow and her family.                               1130
1811,PART THIRD,
1812,PART THIRD,"And Peter Bell, who, till that night,"
1813,PART THIRD,"Had been the wildest of his clan,"
1814,PART THIRD,"Forsook his crimes, renounced [121] his folly,"
1815,PART THIRD,"And, after ten months' melancholy,"
1816,PART THIRD,Became a good and honest man. [K]                       1135

3894,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"which was first published in the ""Poems"" of 1807; and two fragments from"

3896,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"in 'The Friend' in 1809), and 'The Simplon Pass' (first published in the"

3898,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,
3899,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"Wordsworth reached Goslar on the 6th of October 1798, and left it on the"
3900,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,10th of February 1799. It is impossible to determine the precise order
3901,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,in which the nineteen or twenty poems associated with that city were
3902,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,composed. But it is certain that the fragment on the immortal boy of
3903,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,Windermere--whom its cliffs and islands knew so well--was written in
3904,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"1798, and not in 1799 (as Wordsworth himself states); because Coleridge"
3905,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"sent a letter to his friend, thanking him for a MS. copy of these lines,"
3906,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"and commenting on them, of which the date is ""Ratzeburg, Dec. 10, 1798."""
3907,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"For obvious reasons, however, I place the fragments originally meant to"
3908,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"be parts of 'The Recluse' together; and, since Wordsworth gave the date"
3909,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"1799 to the others, it would be gratuitous to suppose that he erred in"
3910,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"reference to them all, because we know that his memory failed him in"
3911,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"reference to one of the series. Therefore, although he spent more than"
3912,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"twice as many days in 1798 as in 1799 at Goslar, I set down this group"
3913,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"of poems as belonging to 1799, rather than to the previous year. It will"
3914,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"be seen that, after placing all the poems of this Goslar period in the"
3915,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"year to which they belong, it is possible also to group them according"
3916,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"to their subject matter, without violating chronological order. I"
3917,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"therefore put the fragments, afterwards incorporated in 'The Prelude',"
3918,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,together. These are naturally followed by 'Nutting'--a poem intended for
3919,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"'The Prelude', but afterwards excluded, as inappropriate. The five poems"
3920,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"referring to ""Lucy"" are placed in sequence, and the same is done with"
3921,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"the four ""Matthew"" poems. A small group of four poems follows"
3922,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"appropriately, viz. 'To a Sexton', 'The Danish Boy', 'Lucy Gray', and"
3923,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,'Ruth'; while the Fenwick note almost necessitates our placing the
3924,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"'Poet's Epitaph' immediately after the Lines 'Written in Germany'; and,"
3925,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"with Wordsworth's life at Goslar, we naturally associate five"

5348,BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER,"Wordsworth writes of him as ""an honoured teacher of my youth;"" and there"
5349,BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER,"describes, with some minuteness, a visit to his grave. (See book x. l."
5350,BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER,"532.) It will be seen, however, from the Fenwick note to 'Matthew', that"
5351,BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER,"the Hawkshead Schoolmaster, like the Wanderer in 'The Excursion', was"
5352,BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER,"""made up of several both of his class and men of other occupations;"" but"

5355,BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER,"interesting, and the most beloved by the boys, and it was doubtless the"
5356,BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER,"memory of this man that gave rise to the above poem, and the four which"
5357,BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER,"follow it. He was but thirty-two years old when he died, 12th June,"
5358,BY THE SIDE OF THE GRAVE SOME YEARS AFTER,"1786. This fact, taken in connection with line 14 of the 'Address', may"

5938,A FRAGMENT,In the editions of 1800-1832 this poem was called 'A Fragment'. From

5949,A FRAGMENT,And in this smooth and open dell                    5
5950,A FRAGMENT,There is a tempest-stricken tree;
5951,A FRAGMENT,"A corner-stone by lightning cut,"

5981,A FRAGMENT,
5982,A FRAGMENT,IV      A harp is from his shoulder slung;

5984,A FRAGMENT,"To words of a forgotten tongue,"
5985,A FRAGMENT,He suits its melody. [10]
5986,A FRAGMENT,Of flocks upon the neighbouring hill [11]
5987,A FRAGMENT,He is the darling and the joy;
5988,A FRAGMENT,"And often, when no cause appears,                  40"
5989,A FRAGMENT,"The mountain-ponies prick their ears,"

5998,A FRAGMENT,So steady or so fair.

6275,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","""THE SCENE OF 'LUCY GRAY'.--In one of the editions of Wordsworth's"
6276,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","works the scene of this ballad is said to have been near Halifax, in"
6277,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",Yorkshire. I do not think the poet was acquainted with the locality
6278,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",beyond a sight of the country in travelling through on some journey. I
6279,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",know of no spot where all the little incidents mentioned in the poem
6280,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","would exactly fit in, and a few of the local allusions are evidently"
6281,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",by a stranger. There is no 'minster'; the church at Halifax from time
6282,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","immemorial has always been known as the 'parish church,' and sometimes"
6283,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","as the 'old church,' but has never been styled 'the minster.' The"
6284,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","'mountain roe,' which of course may be brought in as poetically"
6285,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","illustrative, has not been seen on these hills for generations, and I"
6286,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",scarcely think even the 'fawn at play' for more than a hundred years.
6287,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","These misapplications, it is almost unnecessary to say, do not detract"
6288,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",from the beauty of the poetry. Some of the touches are graphically
6289,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","true to the neighbourhood, as, for instance, 'the wide moor,' the"
6290,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","'many a hill,' the 'steep hill's edge,' the 'long stone wall,' and the"
6291,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","hint of the general loneliness of the region where Lucy 'no mate, no"
6292,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","comrade, knew.' I think I can point out the exact spot--no longer a"
6293,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","'plank,' but a broad, safe bridge--where Lucy fell into the water."
6294,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","Taking a common-sense view, that she would not be sent many miles at"
6295,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","two o'clock on a winter afternoon to the town (Halifax, of course),"
6296,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",over so lonely a mountain moor--bearing in mind also that this moor
6297,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","overlooked the river, and that the river was deep and strong enough to"
6298,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",carry the child down the current--I know only one place where such an
6299,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",accident could have occurred. The clue is in this verse:
6300,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",
6301,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",'At day-break on a hill they stood
6302,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",That overlooked the moor;
6303,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","And thence they saw the bridge of wood,"
6304,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",A furlong from their door.'
6305,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",
6306,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","The hill I take to be the high ridge of Greetland and Norland Moor,"
6307,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","and the plank she had to cross Sterne Mill Bridge, which there spans"
6308,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","the Calder, broad and rapid enough at any season to drown either a"
6309,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","young girl or a grown-up person. The mountain burns, romantic and wild"
6310,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","though they be, are not dangerous to cross, especially for a child old"
6311,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","enough to go and seek her mother. To sum up the matter, the hill"
6312,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","overlooking the moor, the path to and distance from the town, the"
6313,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","bridge, the current, all indicate one point, and one point only, where"
6314,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","this accident could have happened, and that is the bridge near Sterne"
6315,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","Mill. This bridge is so designated from the Sterne family, a branch of"
6316,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",whom in the last century resided close by. The author of 'Tristram
6317,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","Shandy' spent his boyhood here; and Lucy Gray, had she safely crossed"
6318,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","the plank, would immediately have passed Wood Hall, where the boy"
6319,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","Laurence had lived, and, pursuing her way to Halifax, would have gone"
6320,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","through the meadows in which stood Heath School, where young Sterne"
6321,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","had been educated. The mill-weir at Sterne Mill Bridge was, I believe,"
6322,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","the scene of Lucy Gray's death."""
6323,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE",
6324,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","Sterne Mill Bridge, however, crosses the river Calder, while Wordsworth"
6325,"LUCY GRAY; OR, SOLITUDE","tells us that the girl lost her life by falling ""into the lock of a"

6459,RUTH,"When Ruth was left half desolate,"
6460,RUTH,Her Father took another Mate;
6461,RUTH,"And Ruth, not seven years old,"
6462,RUTH,"A slighted child, at her own will [1]"
6463,RUTH,"Went wandering over dale and hill,                     5"
6464,RUTH,"In thoughtless freedom, bold."
6465,RUTH,
6466,RUTH,"And she had made a pipe of straw,"
6467,RUTH,And music from that pipe could draw
6468,RUTH,Like sounds of winds and floods; [2]
6469,RUTH,"Had built a bower upon the green,                     10"
6470,RUTH,As if she from her birth had been
6471,RUTH,An infant of the woods.
6472,RUTH,
6473,RUTH,"Beneath her father's roof, alone [3]"
6474,RUTH,She seemed to live; her thoughts her own;
6475,RUTH,Herself her own delight;                              15
6476,RUTH,"Pleased with herself, nor sad, nor gay;"
6477,RUTH,"And, passing thus the live-long day,"
6478,RUTH,She grew to woman's height. [4]
6479,RUTH,
6480,RUTH,There came a Youth from Georgia's shore--
6481,RUTH,"A military casque he wore,                            20"
6482,RUTH,With splendid feathers drest; [A]
6483,RUTH,He brought them from the Cherokees;
6484,RUTH,"The feathers nodded in the breeze,"
6485,RUTH,And made a gallant crest.
6486,RUTH,
6487,RUTH,From Indian blood you deem him sprung:                25
6488,RUTH,"But no! [5] he spake the English tongue,"
6489,RUTH,And bore [6] a soldier's name;
6490,RUTH,"And, when America was free"
6491,RUTH,"From battle and from jeopardy,"
6492,RUTH,He 'cross the ocean came.                             30
6493,RUTH,
6494,RUTH,With hues of genius on his cheek
6495,RUTH,In finest tones the Youth could speak:
6496,RUTH,"--While he was yet a boy,"
6497,RUTH,"The moon, the glory of the sun,"
6498,RUTH,"And streams that murmur as they run,                  35"
6499,RUTH,Had been his dearest joy.
6500,RUTH,
6501,RUTH,He was a lovely Youth! I guess
6502,RUTH,The panther in the wilderness
6503,RUTH,Was not so fair as he;
6504,RUTH,"And, when he chose to sport and play,                 40"
6505,RUTH,No dolphin ever was so gay
6506,RUTH,Upon the tropic sea.
6507,RUTH,
6508,RUTH,"Among the Indians he had fought,"
6509,RUTH,And with him many tales he brought
6510,RUTH,Of pleasure and of fear;                              45
6511,RUTH,Such tales as told to any maid
6512,RUTH,"By such a Youth, in the green shade,"
6513,RUTH,Were perilous to hear.
6514,RUTH,
6515,RUTH,He told of girls--a happy rout!
6516,RUTH,"Who quit their fold with dance and shout,             50"
6517,RUTH,"Their pleasant Indian town,"
6518,RUTH,To gather strawberries all day long;
6519,RUTH,Returning with a choral song
6520,RUTH,When daylight is gone down.
6521,RUTH,
6522,RUTH,He spake of plants that hourly change                 55
6523,RUTH,"Their blossoms, through a boundless range"
6524,RUTH,Of intermingling hues; [7] [B]
6525,RUTH,"With budding, fading, faded flowers"
6526,RUTH,They stand the wonder of the bowers
6527,RUTH,"From morn to evening dews, [C]                        60"
6528,RUTH,[8]
6529,RUTH,"He told of the magnolia, [D] spread"
6530,RUTH,"High as a cloud, high over head!"
6531,RUTH,The cypress and her spire; [E]
6532,RUTH,--Of flowers [F] that with one scarlet gleam
6533,RUTH,"Cover a hundred leagues, and seem                     65"
6534,RUTH,To set the hills on fire. [G]
6535,RUTH,
6536,RUTH,"The Youth of green savannahs spake,"
6537,RUTH,"And many an endless, endless lake,"
6538,RUTH,With all its fairy crowds
6539,RUTH,"Of islands, that together lie                         70"
6540,RUTH,As quietly as spots of sky
6541,RUTH,Among the evening clouds. [H]
6542,RUTH,
6543,RUTH,"""How pleasant,"" then he said, ""it were [9]"
6544,RUTH,"A fisher or a hunter there,"
6545,RUTH,In sunshine or in shade                               75
6546,RUTH,To wander with an easy mind;
6547,RUTH,"And build a household fire, and find [10]"
6548,RUTH,A home in every glade!
6549,RUTH,
6550,RUTH,"""What days and what bright [11] years! Ah me!"
6551,RUTH,"Our life were life indeed, with thee                  80"
6552,RUTH,"So passed in quiet bliss,"
6553,RUTH,"And all the while,"" said he, ""to know"
6554,RUTH,"That we were in a world of woe,"
6555,RUTH,"On such an earth as this!"""
6556,RUTH,
6557,RUTH,And then he sometimes interwove                       85
6558,RUTH,Fond [12] thoughts about a father's love:
6559,RUTH,"""For there,"" said he, ""are spun"
6560,RUTH,"Around the heart such tender ties,"
6561,RUTH,That our own children to our eyes
6562,RUTH,Are dearer than the sun.                              90
6563,RUTH,
6564,RUTH,"""Sweet Ruth! and could you go with me"
6565,RUTH,"My helpmate in the woods to be,"
6566,RUTH,Our shed at night to rear;
6567,RUTH,"Or run, my own adopted bride,"
6568,RUTH,"A sylvan huntress at my side,                         95"
6569,RUTH,And drive the flying deer!
6570,RUTH,
6571,RUTH,"""BelovÃ¨d Ruth!""--No more he said."
6572,RUTH,The wakeful Ruth at midnight shed [13]
6573,RUTH,A solitary tear:
6574,RUTH,She thought again--and did agree                     100
6575,RUTH,"With him to sail across the sea,"
6576,RUTH,And drive the flying deer.
6577,RUTH,
6578,RUTH,"""And now, as fitting is and right,"
6579,RUTH,"We in the church our faith will plight,"
6580,RUTH,"A husband and a wife.""                               105"
6581,RUTH,Even so they did; and I may say
6582,RUTH,That to sweet Ruth that happy day
6583,RUTH,Was more than human life.
6584,RUTH,
6585,RUTH,"Through dream and vision did she sink,"
6586,RUTH,Delighted all the while to think                     110
6587,RUTH,"That on those lonesome floods,"
6588,RUTH,"And green savannahs, she should share"
6589,RUTH,"His board with lawful joy, and bear"
6590,RUTH,His name in the wild woods.
6591,RUTH,
6592,RUTH,"But, as you have before been told,                   115"
6593,RUTH,"This Stripling, sportive, gay, and bold,"
6594,RUTH,"And, with his dancing crest,"
6595,RUTH,"So beautiful, through savage lands"
6596,RUTH,"Had roamed about, with vagrant bands"
6597,RUTH,Of Indians in the West.                              120
6598,RUTH,
6599,RUTH,"The wind, the tempest roaring high,"
6600,RUTH,"The tumult of a tropic sky,"
6601,RUTH,Might well be dangerous food
6602,RUTH,"For him, a Youth to whom was given"
6603,RUTH,"So much of earth--so much of heaven,                 125"
6604,RUTH,And such impetuous blood.
6605,RUTH,
6606,RUTH,Whatever in those climes he found
6607,RUTH,Irregular in sight or sound
6608,RUTH,Did to his mind impart
6609,RUTH,"A kindred impulse, seemed allied                     130"
6610,RUTH,"To his own powers, and justified"
6611,RUTH,The workings of his heart.
6612,RUTH,
6613,RUTH,"Nor less, to feed voluptuous [14] thought,"
6614,RUTH,"The beauteous forms of nature wrought,"
6615,RUTH,Fair trees and gorgeous [15] flowers;                135
6616,RUTH,The breezes their own languor lent;
6617,RUTH,"The stars had feelings, which they sent"
6618,RUTH,Into those favored [16] bowers.
6619,RUTH,
6620,RUTH,"Yet, in his worst pursuits, I ween"
6621,RUTH,That sometimes [17] there did intervene              140
6622,RUTH,Pure hopes of high intent:
6623,RUTH,For passions linked to forms so fair
6624,RUTH,"And stately, needs must have their share [18]"
6625,RUTH,Of noble sentiment.
6626,RUTH,
6627,RUTH,"But ill he lived, [19] much evil saw,                145"
6628,RUTH,With men to whom no better law
6629,RUTH,Nor better life was known;
6630,RUTH,"Deliberately, and undeceived,"
6631,RUTH,"Those wild men's vices he received,"
6632,RUTH,And gave them back his own.                          150
6633,RUTH,
6634,RUTH,His genius and his moral frame
6635,RUTH,"Were thus impaired, and he became"
6636,RUTH,The slave of low desires:
6637,RUTH,A Man who without self-control
6638,RUTH,Would seek what the degraded soul                    155
6639,RUTH,Unworthily admires.
6640,RUTH,
6641,RUTH,And yet he with no feigned delight
6642,RUTH,"Had wooed the Maiden, day and night"
6643,RUTH,"Had loved her, night and morn:"
6644,RUTH,What could he less than love a Maid                  160
6645,RUTH,Whose heart with so much nature played
6646,RUTH,So kind and so forlorn!
6647,RUTH,
6648,RUTH,"Sometimes, most earnestly, he said,"
6649,RUTH,"""O Ruth! I have been worse than dead;"
6650,RUTH,"False thoughts, thoughts bold and vain,              165"
6651,RUTH,Encompassed me on every side
6652,RUTH,"When I, in confidence and pride,"
6653,RUTH,Had crossed the Atlantic main. [20]
6654,RUTH,
6655,RUTH,"""Before me shone a glorious world--"
6656,RUTH,"Fresh as a banner bright, unfurled                   170"
6657,RUTH,To music suddenly: [21]
6658,RUTH,"I looked upon those hills and plains,"
6659,RUTH,"And seemed as if let loose from chains,"
6660,RUTH,To live at liberty.
6661,RUTH,[22]
6662,RUTH,"""No more of this; for now, by thee,                  175"
6663,RUTH,Dear Ruth! more happily set free
6664,RUTH,With nobler zeal I burn; [23]
6665,RUTH,"My soul from darkness is released,"
6666,RUTH,Like the whole sky when to the east [24]
6667,RUTH,"The morning doth return.""                            180"
6668,RUTH,[25]
6669,RUTH,Full soon that better mind was gone; [26]
6670,RUTH,"No hope, no wish remained, not one,--"
6671,RUTH,They stirred him now no more;
6672,RUTH,"New objects did new pleasure give,"
6673,RUTH,And once again he wished to live                     185
6674,RUTH,As lawless as before.
6675,RUTH,
6676,RUTH,"Meanwhile, as thus with him it fared,"
6677,RUTH,"They for the voyage were prepared,"
6678,RUTH,"And went to the sea-shore,"
6679,RUTH,"But, when they thither came, the Youth               190"
6680,RUTH,"Deserted his poor Bride, and Ruth"
6681,RUTH,Could never find him more.
6682,RUTH,
6683,RUTH,"God help thee, Ruth!-Such pains she had,"
6684,RUTH,"That she in half a year was mad,"
6685,RUTH,And in a prison housed;                              195
6686,RUTH,"And there, with many a doleful song"
6687,RUTH,"Made of wild words, her cup of wrong"
6688,RUTH,She fearfully caroused. [27]
6689,RUTH,
6690,RUTH,"Yet sometimes milder hours she knew,"
6691,RUTH,"Nor wanted sun, nor rain, nor dew,                   200"
6692,RUTH,Nor pastimes of the May;
6693,RUTH,--They all were with her in her cell;
6694,RUTH,And a clear brook  [28] with cheerful knell
6695,RUTH,Did o'er the pebbles play.
6696,RUTH,
6697,RUTH,"When Ruth three seasons thus had lain,               205"
6698,RUTH,There came a respite to her pain;
6699,RUTH,She from her prison fled;
6700,RUTH,But of the Vagrant none took thought;
6701,RUTH,And where it liked her best she sought
6702,RUTH,Her shelter and her bread.                           210
6703,RUTH,
6704,RUTH,Among the fields she breathed again:
6705,RUTH,The master-current of her brain
6706,RUTH,Ran permanent and free;
6707,RUTH,"And, coming to the Banks of Tone, [I]"
6708,RUTH,There did she rest; and dwell alone [29]             215
6709,RUTH,Under the greenwood tree.
6710,RUTH,
6711,RUTH,"The engines of her pain, [30] the tools"
6712,RUTH,"That shaped her sorrow, rocks and pools,"
6713,RUTH,And airs that gently stir
6714,RUTH,The vernal leaves--she loved them still;             220
6715,RUTH,Nor ever taxed them with the ill
6716,RUTH,Which had been done to her.
6717,RUTH,
6718,RUTH,A Barn her _winter_ bed supplies;
6719,RUTH,"But, till the warmth of summer skies"
6720,RUTH,"And summer days is gone,                             225"
6721,RUTH,(And all do in this tale agree) [31]
6722,RUTH,"She sleeps beneath the greenwood tree,"
6723,RUTH,And other home hath none.
6724,RUTH,
6725,RUTH,"An innocent life, yet far astray!"
6726,RUTH,"And Ruth will, long before her day, [32]             230"
6727,RUTH,Be broken down and old:
6728,RUTH,Sore aches she needs must have! but less
6729,RUTH,"Of mind, than body's wretchedness,"
6730,RUTH,"From damp, and rain, and cold. [33]"
6731,RUTH,
6732,RUTH,"If she is prest by want of food,                     235"
6733,RUTH,She from her dwelling in the wood
6734,RUTH,Repairs to a road-side;
6735,RUTH,And there she begs at one steep place
6736,RUTH,Where up and down with easy pace
6737,RUTH,The horsemen-travellers ride.                        240
6738,RUTH,
6739,RUTH,"That oaten pipe of hers is mute,"
6740,RUTH,Or thrown away; but with a flute
6741,RUTH,Her loneliness she cheers:
6742,RUTH,"This flute, made of a hemlock stalk,"
6743,RUTH,At evening in his homeward walk                      245
6744,RUTH,The Quantock woodman hears.
6745,RUTH,
6746,RUTH,"I, too, have passed her on the hills"
6747,RUTH,Setting her little water-mills
6748,RUTH,By spouts and fountains wild--
6749,RUTH,Such small machinery as she turned                   250
6750,RUTH,"Ere she had wept, ere she had mourned,"
6751,RUTH,A young and happy Child!
6752,RUTH,
6753,RUTH,"Farewell! and when thy days are told,"
6754,RUTH,"Ill-fated Ruth, in hallowed mould"
6755,RUTH,"Thy corpse shall buried be,                          255"
6756,RUTH,"For thee a funeral bell shall ring,"
6757,RUTH,And all the congregation sing
6758,RUTH,A Christian psalm for thee.

6763,RUTH,The following extract from Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal gives the date
6764,RUTH,of the stanzas added to 'Ruth' in subsequent editions:
6765,RUTH,
6766,RUTH,"""Sunday, March 8th, 1802.--I stitched up 'The Pedlar,' wrote out"
6767,RUTH,"'Ruth', read it with the alterations.... William brought two new"
6768,RUTH,"stanzas of 'Ruth'."""
6769,RUTH,
6770,RUTH,"The transpositions of stanzas, and their omission from certain editions"
6771,RUTH,"and their subsequent re-introduction, in altered form, in later ones,"
6772,RUTH,make it extremely difficult to give the textual history of 'Ruth' in
6773,RUTH,footnotes. They are even more bewildering than the changes introduced
6774,RUTH,into 'Simon Lee'.--Ed.

7345,[A],"The following is De Quincey's description of it, as he saw it in the"
7346,[A],summer of 1807.
7347,[A],
7348,[A],"""A white cottage, with two yew trees breaking the glare of its white"
7349,[A],"walls"" (these yews still stand on the eastern side of the cottage). ""A"
7350,[A],little semi-vestibule between two doors prefaced the entrance into
7351,[A],what might be considered the principal room of the cottage. It was an
7352,[A],"oblong square, not above eight and a half feet high, sixteen feet"
7353,[A],"long, and twelve broad; wainscoted from floor to ceiling with dark"
7354,[A],"polished oak, slightly embellished with carving. One window there"
7355,[A],"was--a perfect and unpretending cottage window, with little diamond"
7356,[A],"panes, embowered at almost every season of the year with roses; and,"
7357,[A],"in the summer and autumn, with a profusion of jasmine, and other"
7358,[A],"fragrant shrubs.... I was ushered up a little flight of stairs,"
7359,[A],"fourteen in all, to a little drawing-room, or whatever the reader"
7360,[A],chooses to call it. Wordsworth himself has described the fireplace of
7361,[A],this room as his
7362,[A],
7363,[A],'Half-kitchen and half-parlour fire.'
7364,[A],
7365,[A],"It was not fully seven feet six inches high, and in other respects"
7366,[A],pretty nearly of the same dimensions as the rustic hall below. There
7367,[A],"was, however, in a small recess, a library of perhaps three hundred"
7368,[A],"volumes, which seemed to consecrate the room as the poet's study and"
7369,[A],"composing room, and such occasionally it was. But far oftener he both"
7370,[A],"studied, as I found, and composed on the high road."" [B]"
7371,[A],
7372,[A],"Other poems of later years refer, much more fully than the above, to"
7373,[A],"this cottage, and its orchard ground, where so many of Wordsworth's"
7374,[A],lyrics were composed.
7375,[A],
7376,[A],"The ""orchard ground,"" which was for the most part in grass, sloped"
7377,[A],upwards; but a considerable portion of the natural rock was exposed; and
7378,[A],"on its face, some rough stone steps were cut by Wordsworth, helped by a"
7379,[A],near neighbour of his--John Fisher--so as more conveniently to reach the
7380,[A],"upper terrace, where the poet built for himself a small arbour. All this"
7381,[A],garden and orchard ground is not much altered since 1800. The short
7382,[A],"terrace walk is curved, with a sloping bank of grass above, shaded by"
7383,[A],"apple trees, hazel, holly, laburnum, laurel, and mountain ash. Below the"
7384,[A],"terrace is the well, which supplied the cottage in Wordsworth's time;"
7385,[A],"and there large leaved primroses still grow, doubtless the successors of"
7386,[A],"those planted by his own and his sister's hands. Above, and amongst the"
7387,[A],"rocks, are the daffodils, which they also brought to their"
7388,[A],"""garden-ground;"" the Christmas roses, which they planted near the well,"
7389,[A],"were removed to the eastern side of the garden, where they flourished"
7390,[A],"luxuriantly in 1882; but have now, alas! disappeared. The box-wood"
7391,[A],planted by the poet grows close to the cottage. The arbour is now gone;
7392,[A],"but, in the place where it stood, a seat is erected. The hidden brook"
7393,[A],"still sings its under-song, as it used to do, ""its quiet soul on all"
7394,[A],"bestowing,"" and the green linnet may doubtless be seen now, as it used"
7395,[A],"to be in 1803. The allusions to the garden ground at Dove Cottage, in"
7396,[A],"the poems which follow, will be noted as they occur.--Ed."

7490,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","soon reached an inn at a place called Hardrane, and descending from"
7491,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","our vehicles, after warming ourselves by the cottage fire, we walked"
7492,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",up the brook-side to take a view of a third waterfall. We had not
7493,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",walked above a few hundred yards between two winding rocky banks
7494,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","before we came full upon the waterfall, which seemed to throw itself"
7495,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","in a narrow line from a lofty wall of rock, the water, which shot"
7496,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","manifestly to some distance from the rock, seeming to be dispersed"
7497,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",into a thin shower scarcely visible before it reached the bason. We
7498,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","were disappointed in the cascade itself, though the introductory and"
7499,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",accompanying banks were an exquisite mixture of grandeur and
7500,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",beauty.... After cautiously sounding our way over stones of all
7501,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","colours and sizes, encased in the clearest water formed by the spray"
7502,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","of the fall, we found the rock, which before had appeared like a wall,"
7503,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","extending itself over our heads, like the ceiling of a huge cave, from"
7504,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",the summit of which the waters shot directly over our heads into a
7505,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","bason, and among fragments wrinkled over with masses of ice as white"
7506,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","as snow, or rather, as Dorothy says, like congealed froth. The water"
7507,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","fell at least ten yards from us, and we stood directly behind it, the"
7508,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",excavation not so deep in the rock as to impress any feeling of
7509,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","darkness, but lofty and magnificent; but in connection with the"
7510,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",adjoining banks excluding as much of the sky as could well be spared
7511,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",from a scene so exquisitely beautiful. The spot where we stood was as
7512,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","dry as the chamber in which I am now sitting, and the incumbent rock,"
7513,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","of which the groundwork was limestone, veined and dappled with colours"
7514,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",which melted into each other with every possible variety of colour. On
7515,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","the summit of the cave were three festoons, or rather wrinkles, in the"
7516,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","rock, run up parallel like the folds of a curtain when it is drawn up."
7517,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","Each of these was hung with icicles of various length, and nearly in"
7518,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","the middle of the festoon, in the deepest valley of the waves that ran"
7519,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","parallel to each other, the stream shot from the rows of icicles in"
7520,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","irregular fits of strength, and with a body of water that varied every"
7521,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",moment. Sometimes the stream shot into the bason in one continued
7522,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","current; sometimes it was interrupted almost in the midst of its fall,"
7523,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",and was blown towards part of the waterfall at no great distance from
7524,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",our feet like the heaviest thunder shower. In such a situation you
7525,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",have at every moment a feeling of the presence of the sky. Large
7526,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","fleecy clouds drove over our heads above the rush of the water, and"
7527,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",the sky appeared of a blue more than usually brilliant. The rocks on
7528,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","each side, which, joining with the side of this cave, formed the vista"
7529,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","of the brook, were chequered with three diminutive waterfalls, or"
7530,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",rather courses of water. Each of these was a miniature of all that
7531,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",summer and winter can produce of delicate beauty. The rock in the
7532,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","centre of the falls, where the water was most abundant, a deep black,"
7533,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","the adjoining parts yellow, white, purple, and dove colour, covered"
7534,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","with water--plants of the most vivid green, and hung with streaming"
7535,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","icicles, that in some places seem to conceal the verdure of the plants"
7536,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",and the violet and yellow variegation of the rocks; and in some places
7537,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",render the colours more brilliant. I cannot express to you the
7538,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",enchanting effect produced by this Arabian scene of colour as the wind
7539,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","blew aside the great waterfall behind which we stood, and alternately"
7540,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",hid and revealed each of these fairy cataracts in irregular
7541,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","succession, or displayed them with various gradations of distinctness"
7542,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",as the intervening spray was thickened or dispersed. What a scene too
7543,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",in summer! In the luxury of our imagination we could not help feeding
7544,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]","upon the pleasure which this cave, in the heat of a July noon, would"
7545,"""BLEAK SEASON WAS IT, TURBULENT AND BLEAK"" [A]",spread through a frame exquisitely sensible. That huge rock on the

7822,HART-LEAP WELL,"Hart-Leap Well is a small spring of water, about five miles from"
7823,HART-LEAP WELL,"Richmond in Yorkshire, and near the side of the road which leads from"
7824,HART-LEAP WELL,"Richmond to Askrigg. Its name is derived from a remarkable chace, the"
7825,HART-LEAP WELL,memory of which is preserved by the monuments spoken of in the second
7826,HART-LEAP WELL,"Part of the following Poem, which monuments do now exist as I have there"

7829,HART-LEAP WELL,"[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. The first eight stanzas were composed"
7830,HART-LEAP WELL,"extempore one winter evening in the cottage, when, after having tired"
7831,HART-LEAP WELL,"myself with labouring at an awkward passage in 'The Brothers', I started"
7832,HART-LEAP WELL,"with a sudden impulse to this to get rid of the other, and finished it"
7833,HART-LEAP WELL,in a day or two. My sister and I had passed the place a few weeks before
7834,HART-LEAP WELL,in our wild winter journey from Sockburn on the banks of the Tees to
7835,HART-LEAP WELL,Grasmere. A peasant whom we met near the spot told us the story so far
7836,HART-LEAP WELL,"as concerned the name of the Well, and the Hart, and pointed out the"
7837,HART-LEAP WELL,Stones. Both the stones and the well are objects that may easily be
7838,HART-LEAP WELL,missed. The tradition by this time may be extinct in the neighbourhood.

7846,HART-LEAP WELL,The Knight had ridden down from Wensley Moor
7847,HART-LEAP WELL,With the slow motion of a summer's cloud
7848,HART-LEAP WELL,"And now, as he approached a vassal's door,"
7849,HART-LEAP WELL,"""Bring forth another horse!"" he cried aloud. [1]"
7850,HART-LEAP WELL,
7851,HART-LEAP WELL,"""Another horse!""--That shout the vassal heard                   5"
7852,HART-LEAP WELL,"And saddled his best Steed, a comely grey;"
7853,HART-LEAP WELL,Sir Walter mounted him; he was the third
7854,HART-LEAP WELL,Which he had mounted on that glorious day.
7855,HART-LEAP WELL,
7856,HART-LEAP WELL,Joy sparkled in the prancing courser's eyes;
7857,HART-LEAP WELL,The horse and horseman are a happy pair;                       10
7858,HART-LEAP WELL,"But, though Sir Walter like a falcon flies,"
7859,HART-LEAP WELL,There is a doleful silence in the air.
7860,HART-LEAP WELL,
7861,HART-LEAP WELL,"A rout this morning left Sir Walter's Hall,"
7862,HART-LEAP WELL,That as they galloped made the echoes roar;
7863,HART-LEAP WELL,"But horse and man are vanished, one and all;                   15"
7864,HART-LEAP WELL,"Such race, I think, was never seen before."
7865,HART-LEAP WELL,
7866,HART-LEAP WELL,"Sir Walter, restless as a veering wind,"
7867,HART-LEAP WELL,Calls to the few tired dogs that yet remain:
7868,HART-LEAP WELL,"Blanch, [2] Swift, and Music, noblest of their kind,"
7869,HART-LEAP WELL,"Follow, and up the weary mountain strain.                      20"
7870,HART-LEAP WELL,
7871,HART-LEAP WELL,"The Knight hallooed, he cheered and chid them on [3]"
7872,HART-LEAP WELL,With suppliant gestures [4] and upbraidings stern;
7873,HART-LEAP WELL,"But breath and eyesight fail; and, one by one,"
7874,HART-LEAP WELL,The dogs are stretched among the mountain fern.
7875,HART-LEAP WELL,
7876,HART-LEAP WELL,"Where is the throng, the tumult of the race? [5]               25"
7877,HART-LEAP WELL,The bugles that so joyfully were blown?
7878,HART-LEAP WELL,--This chase it looks not like an earthly chase; [6]
7879,HART-LEAP WELL,Sir Walter and the Hart are left alone.
7880,HART-LEAP WELL,
7881,HART-LEAP WELL,The poor Hart toils along the mountain-side;
7882,HART-LEAP WELL,"I will not stop to tell how far he fled,                       30"
7883,HART-LEAP WELL,Nor will I mention by what death he died;
7884,HART-LEAP WELL,But now the Knight beholds him lying dead.
7885,HART-LEAP WELL,
7886,HART-LEAP WELL,"Dismounting, then, he leaned against a thorn;"
7887,HART-LEAP WELL,"He had no follower, dog, nor man, nor boy:"
7888,HART-LEAP WELL,"He neither cracked [7] his whip, nor blew his horn,            35"
7889,HART-LEAP WELL,But gazed upon the spoil with silent joy.
7890,HART-LEAP WELL,
7891,HART-LEAP WELL,"Close to the thorn on which Sir Walter leaned,"
7892,HART-LEAP WELL,Stood his dumb partner in this glorious feat; [8]
7893,HART-LEAP WELL,Weak as a lamb the hour that it is yeaned;
7894,HART-LEAP WELL,And white with foam as if with cleaving sleet. [9]             40
7895,HART-LEAP WELL,
7896,HART-LEAP WELL,Upon his side the Hart was lying stretched:
7897,HART-LEAP WELL,"His nostril touched [10] a spring beneath a hill,"
7898,HART-LEAP WELL,And with the last deep groan his breath had fetched
7899,HART-LEAP WELL,The waters of the spring were trembling still.
7900,HART-LEAP WELL,
7901,HART-LEAP WELL,"And now, too happy for repose or rest,                         45"
7902,HART-LEAP WELL,(Never had living man such joyful lot!) [11]
7903,HART-LEAP WELL,"Sir Walter walked all round, north, south, and west,"
7904,HART-LEAP WELL,And gazed and gazed upon that darling spot. [12]
7905,HART-LEAP WELL,
7906,HART-LEAP WELL,And climbing [13] up the hill--(it was at least
7907,HART-LEAP WELL,Four [14] roods of sheer ascent) Sir Walter found              50
7908,HART-LEAP WELL,Three several hoof-marks which the hunted Beast [15]
7909,HART-LEAP WELL,Had left imprinted on the grassy [16] ground.
7910,HART-LEAP WELL,
7911,HART-LEAP WELL,"Sir Walter wiped his face, and cried, ""Till now"
7912,HART-LEAP WELL,Such sight was never seen by human [17] eyes:
7913,HART-LEAP WELL,"Three leaps have borne him from this lofty brow,               55"
7914,HART-LEAP WELL,Down to the very fountain where he lies.
7915,HART-LEAP WELL,
7916,HART-LEAP WELL,"""I'll build a pleasure-house upon this spot,"
7917,HART-LEAP WELL,"And a small arbour, made for rural joy;"
7918,HART-LEAP WELL,"'Twill be the traveller's shed, the pilgrim's cot,"
7919,HART-LEAP WELL,A place of love for damsels that are coy.                      60
7920,HART-LEAP WELL,
7921,HART-LEAP WELL,"""A cunning artist will I have to frame"
7922,HART-LEAP WELL,A basin for that fountain in the dell!
7923,HART-LEAP WELL,"And they who do make mention of the same,"
7924,HART-LEAP WELL,"From this day forth, shall call it HART-LEAP WELL."
7925,HART-LEAP WELL,
7926,HART-LEAP WELL,"""And, gallant Stag! [18] to make thy praises known,            65"
7927,HART-LEAP WELL,Another monument shall here be raised;
7928,HART-LEAP WELL,"Three several pillars, each a rough-hewn stone,"
7929,HART-LEAP WELL,And planted where thy hoofs the turf have grazed.
7930,HART-LEAP WELL,
7931,HART-LEAP WELL,"""And, in the summer-time when days are long,"
7932,HART-LEAP WELL,I will come hither with my Paramour;                           70
7933,HART-LEAP WELL,And with the dancers and the minstrel's song
7934,HART-LEAP WELL,We will make merry in that pleasant bower.
7935,HART-LEAP WELL,
7936,HART-LEAP WELL,"""Till the foundations of the mountains fail"
7937,HART-LEAP WELL,My mansion with its arbour shall endure;--
7938,HART-LEAP WELL,"The joy of them who till the fields of Swale,                  75"
7939,HART-LEAP WELL,"And them who dwell among the woods of Ure!"""
7940,HART-LEAP WELL,
7941,HART-LEAP WELL,"Then home he went, and left the Hart, stone-dead,"
7942,HART-LEAP WELL,With breathless nostrils stretched above the spring.
7943,HART-LEAP WELL,--Soon did the Knight perform what he had said;
7944,HART-LEAP WELL,And far and wide the fame thereof did ring. [19]               80
7945,HART-LEAP WELL,
7946,HART-LEAP WELL,"Ere thrice the Moon into her port had steered,"
7947,HART-LEAP WELL,A cup of stone received the living well;
7948,HART-LEAP WELL,"Three pillars of rude stone Sir Walter reared,"
7949,HART-LEAP WELL,And built a house of pleasure in the dell.
7950,HART-LEAP WELL,
7951,HART-LEAP WELL,"And near the fountain, flowers of stature tall                 85"
7952,HART-LEAP WELL,"With trailing plants and trees were intertwined,--"
7953,HART-LEAP WELL,"Which soon composed a little sylvan hall,"
7954,HART-LEAP WELL,A leafy shelter from the sun and wind.
7955,HART-LEAP WELL,
7956,HART-LEAP WELL,"And thither, when the summer days were long"
7957,HART-LEAP WELL,Sir Walter led his wondering Paramour; [20]                    90
7958,HART-LEAP WELL,And with the dancers and the minstrel's song
7959,HART-LEAP WELL,Made merriment within that pleasant bower.
7960,HART-LEAP WELL,
7961,HART-LEAP WELL,"The Knight, Sir Walter, died in course of time,"
7962,HART-LEAP WELL,And his bones lie in his paternal vale.--
7963,HART-LEAP WELL,"But there is matter for a second rhyme,                        95"

8317,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"Askrigg, at a distance of not more than three and a-half miles from"
8318,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"Richmond, and not five miles as stated in the prefatory note to the"

8343,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,the road is bounded by a stone wall: another wall meeting this one at

8346,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"any rough-hewn stone. Descending on the other side, I found in the"

8385,A PASTORAL,anecdote concerning this subject. When Coleridge and Southey were
8386,A PASTORAL,"walking together upon the Fells, Southey observed that, if I wished to"
8387,A PASTORAL,"be considered a faithful painter of rural manners, I ought not to have"
8388,A PASTORAL,said that my shepherd-boys trimmed their rustic hats as described in the
8389,A PASTORAL,poem. Just as the words had passed his lips two boys appeared with the
8390,A PASTORAL,very plant entwined round their hats. I have often wondered that
8391,A PASTORAL,"Southey, who rambled so much about the mountains, should have fallen"
8392,A PASTORAL,"into this mistake, and I record it as a warning for others who, with far"
8393,A PASTORAL,"less opportunity than my dear friend had of knowing what things are, and"
8394,A PASTORAL,"far less sagacity, give way to presumptuous criticism, from which he was"
8395,A PASTORAL,"free, though in this matter mistaken. In describing a tarn under"

8673,A PASTORAL,"[Written at Town-end, Grasmere. Barbara Lewthwaite, now living at"
8674,A PASTORAL,"Ambleside (1843), though much changed as to beauty, was one of two most"
8675,A PASTORAL,"lovely sisters. Almost the first words my poor brother John said, when"
8676,A PASTORAL,"he visited us for the first time at Grasmere, were, ""Were those two"
8677,A PASTORAL,"Angels that I have just seen?"" and from his description, I have no doubt"
8678,A PASTORAL,they were those two sisters. The mother died in childbed; and one of our
8679,A PASTORAL,neighbours at Grasmere told me that the loveliest sight she had ever
8680,A PASTORAL,seen was that mother as she lay in her coffin with her babe in her arm.
8681,A PASTORAL,I mention this to notice what I cannot but think a salutary custom once
8682,A PASTORAL,universal in these vales. Every attendant on a funeral made it a duty to
8683,A PASTORAL,"look at the corpse in the coffin before the lid was closed, which was"
8684,A PASTORAL,never done (nor I believe is now) till a minute or two before the corpse
8685,A PASTORAL,was removed. Barbara Lewthwaite was not in fact the child whom I had
8686,A PASTORAL,seen and overheard as described in the poem. I chose the name for
8687,A PASTORAL,reasons implied in the above; and here will add a caution against the
8688,A PASTORAL,use of names of living persons. Within a few months after the
8689,A PASTORAL,"publication of this poem, I was much surprised, and more hurt, to find"
8690,A PASTORAL,"it in a child's school book, which, having been compiled by Lindley"
8691,A PASTORAL,"Murray, had come into use at Grasmere School where Barbara was a pupil;"
8692,A PASTORAL,"and, alas! I had the mortification of hearing that she was very vain of"
8693,A PASTORAL,"being thus distinguished; and, in after life she used to say that she"
8694,A PASTORAL,"remembered the incident, and what I said to her upon the occasion.--I."

8898,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8899,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,He dwells in the centre of London's wide Town;                       5
8900,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,His staff is a sceptre--his grey hairs a crown;

8906,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"That countenance there fashioned, which, spite of a stain [2]"
8907,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"That his life hath received, to the last will remain. [3]"
8908,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8909,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,A Farmer he was; and his house [4] far and near
8910,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Was the boast of the country [5] for excellent cheer:
8911,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,How oft have I heard in sweet Tilsbury Vale                         15
8912,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Of the silver-rimmed horn whence he dealt his mild ale! [6]
8913,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8914,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Yet Adam was far as the farthest from ruin,"
8915,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,His fields seemed to know what their Master was doing;
8916,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"And turnips, and corn-land, [7] and meadow, and lea,"
8917,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,All caught the infection--as generous as he.                        20
8918,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8919,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Yet Adam prized little the feast and the bowl, [8]--"
8920,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,The fields better suited the ease of his soul:
8921,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"He strayed through the fields like an indolent wight,"
8922,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,The quiet of nature was Adam's delight.
8923,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8924,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"For Adam was simple in thought; and the poor,                       25"
8925,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Familiar with him, made an inn of his door:"
8926,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"He gave them the best that he had; or, to say"
8927,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"What less may mislead you, they took it away."
8928,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,[9]
8929,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Thus thirty smooth years did he thrive on his farm:
8930,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,The Genius of plenty preserved him from harm:                       30
8931,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"At length, what to most is a season of sorrow,"
8932,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"His means are [10] run out,--he must beg, or must borrow."

8939,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"He paid what he could with his [12] ill-gotten pelf,"
8940,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"And something, it might be, reserved for himself: [13]"
8941,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Then (what is too true) without hinting a word,"
8942,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Turned his back on the country--and off like a bird.                40
8943,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8944,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,You lift up your eyes!--but I guess that you frame
8945,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,A judgment too harsh of the sin and the shame; [14]
8946,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"In him it was scarcely [15] a business of art,"
8947,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,For this he did all in the _ease_ [16] of his heart.
8948,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8949,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,To London--a sad emigration I ween--45
8950,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,With his grey hairs he went from the brook [17] and the green;
8951,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"And there, with small wealth but his legs and his hands,"
8952,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,As lonely he stood as [18] a crow on the sands.
8953,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8954,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"All trades, as need [19] was, did old Adam assume,--"
8955,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Served as stable-boy, errand-boy, porter, and groom;                50"
8956,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"But nature is gracious, necessity kind,"
8957,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"And, in spite of the shame that may lurk in his mind, [20]"
8958,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,[21]
8959,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"He seems ten birthdays younger, is green and is stout; [22]"
8960,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Twice as fast as before does his blood run about;
8961,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"You would [23] say that each hair of his beard was alive,           55"
8962,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,And his fingers are busy as bees in a hive.
8963,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8964,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,For he's not like an Old Man that leisurely goes
8965,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"About work that he knows, [24] in a track that he knows;"
8966,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"But often his mind is compelled to demur,"
8967,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,And you guess that the more then his body must stir.                60
8968,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8969,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"In the throng of the town like a stranger is he,"
8970,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Like one whose own country's far over the sea;
8971,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"And Nature, while through the great city he hies,"
8972,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Full ten times a day takes his heart by surprise.
8973,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8974,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"This gives him the fancy of one that is young,                      65"
8975,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,More of soul in his face than of words on [25] his tongue;
8976,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Like a maiden of twenty he trembles and sighs,"
8977,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,And tears of fifteen will come [26] into his eyes.
8978,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8979,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"What's a tempest to him, or the dry parching heats?"
8980,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Yet he watches the clouds that pass over the streets;               70
8981,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"With a look of such earnestness often will stand, [27]"
8982,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,You might think he'd twelve reapers at work in the Strand.
8983,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8984,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Where proud Covent-garden, in desolate hours"
8985,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Of snow and hoar-frost, spreads her fruits and her flowers,"
8986,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Old Adam will smile at the pains that have made                     75
8987,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,Poor winter look fine in such strange masquerade. [28]
8988,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,[29]
8989,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"'Mid coaches and chariots, a waggon of straw,"
8990,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Like a magnet, the heart of old Adam can draw;"
8991,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"With a thousand soft pictures his memory will teem,"
8992,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,And his hearing is touched with the sounds of a dream.              80
8993,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8994,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Up the Haymarket hill he oft whistles his way,"
8995,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Thrusts his hands in a waggon, and smells at the hay; [30]"
8996,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"He thinks of the fields he so often hath mown,"
8997,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,And is happy as if the rich freight were his own. [31]
8998,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
8999,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"But chiefly to Smithfield he loves to repair,--85"
9000,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"If you pass by at morning, you'll meet with him there."
9001,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"The breath of the cows you may see him inhale,"
9002,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,And his heart all the while is in Tilsbury Vale.
9003,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,
9004,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"Now farewell, old Adam! when low [32] thou art laid,"
9005,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,May one blade of grass spring over [33] thy head;                   90
9006,THE FARMER OF TILSBURY VALE,"And I hope that thy grave, wheresoever it be,"

9476,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,
9477,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,This walk and conversation took place in October 1836. If any one is
9478,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"surprised that Wordsworth, supposing him to have been then looking into"
9479,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"the very dell on which he wrote the above poem in 1800, did not name it"
9480,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"to Mr. Coleridge, he must remember that he was not in the habit of"
9481,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"speaking of the places he had memorialised in verse, and that in 1836"
9482,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"his ""Sister Emmeline"" had for a year been a confirmed invalid at Rydal."
9483,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,I have repeatedly followed Easdale beck all the way up from its junction

9485,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,to the realistic detail of this poem as the one suggested by Dr.
9486,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"Cradock. There are two places further up the dale where the ""sallies of"

9561,TO JOANNA,One summer morning we had walked abroad
9562,TO JOANNA,"At break of day, Joanna and myself."
9563,TO JOANNA,"--'Twas that delightful season when the broom,"
9564,TO JOANNA,"Full-flowered, and visible on every steep,"

9571,TO JOANNA,"To note in shrub and tree, in stone and flower"
9572,TO JOANNA,"That intermixture of delicious hues,"

9576,TO JOANNA,"--When I had gazed perhaps two minutes' space,"
9577,TO JOANNA,"Joanna, looking in my eyes, beheld"
9578,TO JOANNA,"That ravishment of mine, and laughed aloud."
9579,TO JOANNA,"The Rock, like something starting from a sleep,"
9580,TO JOANNA,"Took up the Lady's voice, and laughed again;                   55"
9581,TO JOANNA,That ancient Woman seated on Helm-crag
9582,TO JOANNA,"Was ready with her cavern; Hammar-scar,"
9583,TO JOANNA,"And the tall Steep of Silver-how, sent forth"
9584,TO JOANNA,"A noise of laughter; southern Loughrigg heard,"
9585,TO JOANNA,And Fairfield answered with a mountain tone;                   60
9586,TO JOANNA,Helvellyn far into the clear blue sky
9587,TO JOANNA,"Carried the Lady's voice,--old Skiddaw blew"

9589,TO JOANNA,Of Glaramara southward came the voice;

9604,TO JOANNA,"Beneath this rock, at sunrise, on a calm"

9694,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"that impressive single Mountain at the head of the Vale of Grasmere, is"
9695,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,a Rock which from most points of view bears a striking resemblance to an
9696,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,Old Woman cowering. Close by this rock is one of those Fissures or
9697,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Caverns, which in the language of the Country are called Dungeons. The"

9729,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"and it is useless to enquire. If he did so, the discovery of the place"
9730,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,would not help any one to understand or appreciate the poem. It is
9731,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"obvious that he did not intend to be literally exact in details, as the"
9732,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"poem was written in 1800, and addressed to Joanna Hutchinson,--who is"
9733,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"spoken of as having been absent from Grasmere ""for two long years;"" and"
9734,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,Wordsworth says that he carved the Runic characters 'in memoriam'
9735,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,eighteen months after that summer morning when he heard the echo of her
9736,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,laugh. But the family took up residence at Grasmere only in December
9737,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"1799, and the ""Poems on the Naming of Places"" were published before the"
9738,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"close of 1800. The effect of these lines to Joanna, however, is"
9739,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,certainly not impaired--it may even be enhanced--by our inability to
9740,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,localise them. Only one in the list of places referred to can occasion
9741,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"any perplexity, viz., Hammar-scar, since it is a name now disused in the"
9742,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,district. It used to be applied to some rocks on the flank of
9743,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Silver-how, to the wood around them, and also to the gorge between"

9771,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,instance of indebtedness--in which the debt is repaid by additional
9772,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,insight--is seen when we compare a passage from Sir John Davies's
9773,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"'Orchestra, or a poem on Dancing' (stanza 49), with one from 'The"

10208,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"To find the pool referred to in the Fenwick note, I have carefully"
10209,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"examined the course of Rydal beck, all the way up to the foot of the"

10452,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"eleven o'clock, intending to stay out of doors all the morning. We"
10453,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"went towards Rydal, under Nab Scar. The sun shone and we were lazy."
10454,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,Coleridge pitched upon several places to sit down upon; but we could
10455,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"not be all of one mind respecting sun and shade, so we pushed on to"
10456,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"the foot of the Scar. It was very grand when we looked up, very stony;"

10458,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"Yew-tree that breasts the wind had lost its character as a tree, and"
10459,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,had become like solid wood. Coleridge and I pushed on before. We left
10460,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"William sitting on the stones, feasting with silence, and I sat down"

11172,THE BROTHERS [A],Employed in winter's work. Upon the stone
11173,THE BROTHERS [A],"His wife sate near him, teasing matted wool,"
11174,THE BROTHERS [A],"While, from the twin cards toothed with glittering wire,"
11175,THE BROTHERS [A],"He fed the spindle of his youngest child,"
11176,THE BROTHERS [A],"Who, in the open air, with due accord                          25"
11177,THE BROTHERS [A],"Of busy hands and back-and-forward steps,"
11178,THE BROTHERS [A],Her large round wheel was turning. [3] Towards the field
11179,THE BROTHERS [A],"In which the Parish Chapel stood alone,"
11180,THE BROTHERS [A],"Girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall,"
11181,THE BROTHERS [A],"While half an hour went by, the Priest had sent                30"
11182,THE BROTHERS [A],"Many a long look of wonder: and at last,"
11183,THE BROTHERS [A],"Risen from his seat, beside the snow white ridge"
11184,THE BROTHERS [A],Of carded wool which the old man had piled
11185,THE BROTHERS [A],"He laid his implements with gentle care,"
11186,THE BROTHERS [A],"Each in the other locked; and, down the path                   35"
11187,THE BROTHERS [A],"That [4] from his cottage to the church-yard led,"
11188,THE BROTHERS [A],"He took his way, impatient to accost"
11189,THE BROTHERS [A],"The Stranger, whom he saw still lingering there."
11190,THE BROTHERS [A],
11191,THE BROTHERS [A],"'Twas one well known to him in former days,"
11192,THE BROTHERS [A],A Shepherd-lad; who ere his sixteenth year                     40
11193,THE BROTHERS [A],"Had left that calling, tempted to entrust"
11194,THE BROTHERS [A],His expectations to the fickle winds
11195,THE BROTHERS [A],And perilous waters; with the mariners [5]
11196,THE BROTHERS [A],A fellow-mariner;--and so had fared
11197,THE BROTHERS [A],Through twenty seasons; but he had been reared                 45
11198,THE BROTHERS [A],"Among the mountains, and he in his heart"
11199,THE BROTHERS [A],Was half a shepherd on the stormy seas.
11200,THE BROTHERS [A],Oft in the piping shrouds had Leonard heard
11201,THE BROTHERS [A],"The tones of waterfalls, and inland sounds"
11202,THE BROTHERS [A],"Of caves and trees:--and, when the regular wind                50"
11203,THE BROTHERS [A],"Between the tropics filled the steady sail,"
11204,THE BROTHERS [A],"And blew with the same breath through days and weeks,"
11205,THE BROTHERS [A],Lengthening invisibly its weary line
11206,THE BROTHERS [A],"Along the cloudless Main, he, in those hours"
11207,THE BROTHERS [A],"Of tiresome indolence, would often hang                        55"
11208,THE BROTHERS [A],"Over the vessel's side, and gaze and gaze;"
11209,THE BROTHERS [A],"And, while the broad blue [6] wave and sparkling foam"
11210,THE BROTHERS [A],Flashed round him images and hues that wrought
11211,THE BROTHERS [A],"In union with the employment of his heart,"
11212,THE BROTHERS [A],"He, thus by feverish passion overcome,                         60"
11213,THE BROTHERS [A],"Even with the organs of his bodily eye,"
11214,THE BROTHERS [A],"Below him, in the bosom of the deep,"
11215,THE BROTHERS [A],Saw mountains; saw the forms of sheep that grazed
11216,THE BROTHERS [A],"On verdant hills--with dwellings among trees,"
11217,THE BROTHERS [A],And shepherds clad in the same country grey                    65
11218,THE BROTHERS [A],Which he himself had worn. [C]
11219,THE BROTHERS [A],
11220,THE BROTHERS [A],"And now, at last, [7]"
11221,THE BROTHERS [A],"From perils manifold, with some small wealth"
11222,THE BROTHERS [A],"Acquired by traffic 'mid [8] the Indian Isles,"
11223,THE BROTHERS [A],"To his paternal home he is returned,                           70"
11224,THE BROTHERS [A],With a determined purpose to resume
11225,THE BROTHERS [A],The life he had lived there; [9] both for the sake
11226,THE BROTHERS [A],"Of many darling pleasures, and the love"
11227,THE BROTHERS [A],Which to an only brother he has borne
11228,THE BROTHERS [A],"In all his hardships, since that happy time                    75"
11229,THE BROTHERS [A],"When, whether it blew foul or fair, they two"
11230,THE BROTHERS [A],Were brother-shepherds on their native hills.
11231,THE BROTHERS [A],"--They were the last of all their race: and now,"
11232,THE BROTHERS [A],"When Leonard had approached his home, his heart"
11233,THE BROTHERS [A],"Failed in him; and, not venturing to enquire                   80"
11234,THE BROTHERS [A],"Tidings of one so long and dearly loved, [10]"
11235,THE BROTHERS [A],He to the solitary church-yard turned; [11]
11236,THE BROTHERS [A],"That, as he knew in what particular spot"
11237,THE BROTHERS [A],"His family were laid, he thence might learn"
11238,THE BROTHERS [A],"If still his Brother lived, or to the file                     85"
11239,THE BROTHERS [A],Another grave was added.--He had found
11240,THE BROTHERS [A],"Another grave,--near which a full half-hour"
11241,THE BROTHERS [A],"He had remained; but, as he gazed, there grew"
11242,THE BROTHERS [A],"Such a confusion in his memory,"
11243,THE BROTHERS [A],That he began to doubt; and even to hope [12]                  90
11244,THE BROTHERS [A],"That he had seen this heap of turf before,--"
11245,THE BROTHERS [A],That it was not another grave; but one
11246,THE BROTHERS [A],"He had forgotten. He had lost his path,"
11247,THE BROTHERS [A],"As up the vale, that afternoon, he walked [13]"
11248,THE BROTHERS [A],Through fields which once had been well known to him:          95
11249,THE BROTHERS [A],And oh what joy this [14] recollection now
11250,THE BROTHERS [A],"Sent to his heart! he lifted up his eyes,"
11251,THE BROTHERS [A],"And, looking round, imagined that he saw [15]"
11252,THE BROTHERS [A],Strange alteration wrought on every side
11253,THE BROTHERS [A],"Among the woods and fields, and that the rocks,               100"
11254,THE BROTHERS [A],And everlasting hills [16] themselves were changed.
11255,THE BROTHERS [A],
11256,THE BROTHERS [A],"By this the Priest, who down the field had come,"
11257,THE BROTHERS [A],"Unseen by Leonard, at the church-yard gate"
11258,THE BROTHERS [A],"Stopped short,--and thence, at leisure, limb by limb"
11259,THE BROTHERS [A],Perused him [17] with a gay complacency.                      105
11260,THE BROTHERS [A],"Ay, thought the Vicar, smiling to himself,"
11261,THE BROTHERS [A],'Tis one of those who needs must leave the path
11262,THE BROTHERS [A],Of the world's business to go wild alone:
11263,THE BROTHERS [A],His arms have a perpetual holiday;
11264,THE BROTHERS [A],"The happy man will creep about the fields,                    110"
11265,THE BROTHERS [A],"Following his fancies by the hour, to bring"
11266,THE BROTHERS [A],"Tears down his cheek, [18] or solitary smiles"
11267,THE BROTHERS [A],"Into his face, until the setting sun"
11268,THE BROTHERS [A],Write fool upon his forehead.--Planted thus
11269,THE BROTHERS [A],Beneath a shed that over-arched the gate                      120
11270,THE BROTHERS [A],"Of this rude church-yard, till the stars appeared"
11271,THE BROTHERS [A],"The good Man might have communed with himself,"
11272,THE BROTHERS [A],"But that the Stranger, who had left the grave,"
11273,THE BROTHERS [A],"Approached; he recognised the Priest at once,"
11274,THE BROTHERS [A],"And, after greetings interchanged, and given                  120"
11275,THE BROTHERS [A],By Leonard to the Vicar as to one
11276,THE BROTHERS [A],"Unknown to him, this dialogue ensued."
11277,THE BROTHERS [A],
11278,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Leonard_. You live, Sir, in these dales, a quiet life:"
11279,THE BROTHERS [A],Your years make up one peaceful family;
11280,THE BROTHERS [A],"And who would grieve and fret, if, welcome come               125"
11281,THE BROTHERS [A],"And welcome gone, they are so like each other,"
11282,THE BROTHERS [A],They cannot be remembered? Scarce a funeral
11283,THE BROTHERS [A],Comes to this church-yard once in eighteen months;
11284,THE BROTHERS [A],"And yet, some changes must take place among you:"
11285,THE BROTHERS [A],"And you, who dwell here, even among these rocks,              130"
11286,THE BROTHERS [A],"Can trace the finger of mortality,"
11287,THE BROTHERS [A],"And see, that with our threescore years and ten"
11288,THE BROTHERS [A],"We are not all that perish.--I remember,"
11289,THE BROTHERS [A],(For many years ago I passed this road)
11290,THE BROTHERS [A],There was a foot-way all along the fields                     135
11291,THE BROTHERS [A],By the brook-side--'tis gone--and that dark cleft!
11292,THE BROTHERS [A],To me it does not seem to wear the face
11293,THE BROTHERS [A],Which then it had!
11294,THE BROTHERS [A],
11295,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_. Nay, Sir, [19] for aught I know,"
11296,THE BROTHERS [A],That chasm is much the same--140
11297,THE BROTHERS [A],
11298,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Leonard_. But, surely, yonder--"
11299,THE BROTHERS [A],
11300,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_. Ay, there, indeed, your memory is a friend"
11301,THE BROTHERS [A],That does not play you false.--On that tall pike
11302,THE BROTHERS [A],(It is the loneliest place of all these hills)
11303,THE BROTHERS [A],"There were two springs which bubbled side by side, [D]        145"
11304,THE BROTHERS [A],As if they had been made that they might be
11305,THE BROTHERS [A],Companions for each other: the huge crag
11306,THE BROTHERS [A],Was rent with lightning--one hath disappeared; [20]
11307,THE BROTHERS [A],"The other, left behind, is flowing still,"
11308,THE BROTHERS [A],"For accidents and changes such as these,                      150"
11309,THE BROTHERS [A],We want not store of them; [21]--a water-spout
11310,THE BROTHERS [A],Will bring down half a mountain; what a feast
11311,THE BROTHERS [A],"For folks that wander up and down like you,"
11312,THE BROTHERS [A],To see an acre's breadth of that wide cliff
11313,THE BROTHERS [A],One roaring cataract! a sharp May-storm                       155
11314,THE BROTHERS [A],"Will come with loads of January snow,"
11315,THE BROTHERS [A],And in one night send twenty score of sheep
11316,THE BROTHERS [A],To feed the ravens; or a shepherd dies
11317,THE BROTHERS [A],By some untoward death among the rocks:
11318,THE BROTHERS [A],The ice breaks up and sweeps away a bridge;                   160
11319,THE BROTHERS [A],A wood is felled:--and then for our own homes!
11320,THE BROTHERS [A],"A child is born or christened, a field ploughed,"
11321,THE BROTHERS [A],"A daughter sent to service, a web spun,"
11322,THE BROTHERS [A],The old house-clock is decked with a new face;
11323,THE BROTHERS [A],"And hence, so far from wanting facts or dates                 165"
11324,THE BROTHERS [A],"To chronicle the time, we all have here"
11325,THE BROTHERS [A],"A pair of diaries,--one serving, Sir,"
11326,THE BROTHERS [A],"For the whole dale, and one for each fire-side--"
11327,THE BROTHERS [A],"Yours was a stranger's judgment: for historians,"
11328,THE BROTHERS [A],Commend me to these valleys!                                  170
11329,THE BROTHERS [A],
11330,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_.             Yet your Church-yard
11331,THE BROTHERS [A],"Seems, if such freedom may be used with you,"
11332,THE BROTHERS [A],To say that you are heedless of the past:
11333,THE BROTHERS [A],An orphan could not find his mother's grave:
11334,THE BROTHERS [A],"Here's neither head nor foot-stone, plate of brass,           175"
11335,THE BROTHERS [A],"Cross-bones nor skull,--type of our earthly state"
11336,THE BROTHERS [A],Nor emblem of our hopes: [22] the dead man's home
11337,THE BROTHERS [A],Is but a fellow to that pasture-field.
11338,THE BROTHERS [A],
11339,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_. Why, there, Sir, is a thought that's new to me!"
11340,THE BROTHERS [A],"The stone-cutters, 'tis true, might beg their bread           180"
11341,THE BROTHERS [A],If every English church-yard were like ours;
11342,THE BROTHERS [A],Yet your conclusion wanders from the truth:
11343,THE BROTHERS [A],We have no need of names and epitaphs;
11344,THE BROTHERS [A],We talk about the dead by our fire-sides.
11345,THE BROTHERS [A],"And then, for our immortal part! _we_ want                    185"
11346,THE BROTHERS [A],"No symbols, Sir, to tell us that plain tale:"
11347,THE BROTHERS [A],The thought of death sits easy on the man
11348,THE BROTHERS [A],Who has been born and dies among the mountains. [E]
11349,THE BROTHERS [A],
11350,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Leonard_. Your Dalesmen, then, do in each other's thoughts"
11351,THE BROTHERS [A],Possess a kind of second life: no doubt                       190
11352,THE BROTHERS [A],"You, Sir, could help me to the history"
11353,THE BROTHERS [A],Of half these graves?
11354,THE BROTHERS [A],
11355,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_.             For eight-score winters past,"
11356,THE BROTHERS [A],"With what I've witnessed, and with what I've heard,"
11357,THE BROTHERS [A],"Perhaps I might; and, on a winter-evening, [23]               195"
11358,THE BROTHERS [A],"If you were seated at my chimney's nook,"
11359,THE BROTHERS [A],"By turning o'er these hillocks one by one,"
11360,THE BROTHERS [A],"We two could travel, Sir, through a strange round;"
11361,THE BROTHERS [A],Yet all in the broad highway of the world.
11362,THE BROTHERS [A],"Now there's a grave--your foot is half upon it,--200"
11363,THE BROTHERS [A],It looks just like the rest; and yet that man
11364,THE BROTHERS [A],Died broken-hearted.
11365,THE BROTHERS [A],
11366,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_.           'Tis a common case.
11367,THE BROTHERS [A],We'll take another: who is he that lies
11368,THE BROTHERS [A],"Beneath yon ridge, the last of those three graves?            205"
11369,THE BROTHERS [A],It touches on that piece of native rock
11370,THE BROTHERS [A],Left in the church-yard wall.
11371,THE BROTHERS [A],
11372,THE BROTHERS [A],_Priest_.                     That's Walter Ewbank. [F]
11373,THE BROTHERS [A],He had as white a head and fresh a cheek
11374,THE BROTHERS [A],As ever were produced by youth and age                        210
11375,THE BROTHERS [A],Engendering in the blood of hale fourscore.
11376,THE BROTHERS [A],Through five [24] long generations had the heart
11377,THE BROTHERS [A],Of Walter's forefathers o'erflowed the bounds
11378,THE BROTHERS [A],"Of their inheritance, that single cottage--"
11379,THE BROTHERS [A],You see it yonder! and those few green fields.                215
11380,THE BROTHERS [A],"They toiled and wrought, and still, from sire to son,"
11381,THE BROTHERS [A],"Each struggled, and each yielded as before"
11382,THE BROTHERS [A],"A little--yet a little,--and old Walter,"
11383,THE BROTHERS [A],"They left to him the family heart, and land"
11384,THE BROTHERS [A],With other burthens than the crop it bore.                    220
11385,THE BROTHERS [A],Year after year the old man still kept up [25]
11386,THE BROTHERS [A],"A cheerful mind,--and buffeted with bond,"
11387,THE BROTHERS [A],"Interest, and mortgages; at last he sank,"
11388,THE BROTHERS [A],And went into his grave before his time.
11389,THE BROTHERS [A],Poor Walter! whether it was care that spurred him             225
11390,THE BROTHERS [A],"God only knows, but to the very last"
11391,THE BROTHERS [A],He had the lightest foot in Ennerdale:
11392,THE BROTHERS [A],His pace was never that of an old man:
11393,THE BROTHERS [A],I almost see him tripping down the path
11394,THE BROTHERS [A],"With his two grandsons after him:--but you,                   230"
11395,THE BROTHERS [A],"Unless our Landlord be your host to-night,"
11396,THE BROTHERS [A],"Have far to travel,--and on [26] these rough paths"
11397,THE BROTHERS [A],Even in the longest day of midsummer--
11398,THE BROTHERS [A],
11399,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_. But those [27] two Orphans!
11400,THE BROTHERS [A],
11401,THE BROTHERS [A],_Priest_.                   Orphans!--Such they were--235
11402,THE BROTHERS [A],"Yet not while Walter lived:--for, though their parents"
11403,THE BROTHERS [A],"Lay buried side by side as now they lie,"
11404,THE BROTHERS [A],"The old man was a father to the boys,"
11405,THE BROTHERS [A],"Two fathers in one father: and if tears,"
11406,THE BROTHERS [A],"Shed when he talked of them where they were not,              240"
11407,THE BROTHERS [A],"And hauntings from the infirmity of love,"
11408,THE BROTHERS [A],"Are aught of what makes up a mother's heart,"
11409,THE BROTHERS [A],"This old Man, in the day of his old age,"
11410,THE BROTHERS [A],"Was half a mother to them.--If you weep, Sir,"
11411,THE BROTHERS [A],"To hear a stranger talking about strangers,                   245"
11412,THE BROTHERS [A],Heaven bless you when you are among your kindred!
11413,THE BROTHERS [A],Ay--you may turn that way--it is a grave
11414,THE BROTHERS [A],Which will bear looking at.
11415,THE BROTHERS [A],
11416,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_.                  These boys--I hope
11417,THE BROTHERS [A],They loved this good old Man?--250
11418,THE BROTHERS [A],
11419,THE BROTHERS [A],_Priest_.                      They did--and truly:
11420,THE BROTHERS [A],"But that was what we almost overlooked,"
11421,THE BROTHERS [A],"They were such darlings of each other. Yes,"
11422,THE BROTHERS [A],"Though from the cradle they had lived with Walter,"
11423,THE BROTHERS [A],"The only kinsman near them, and though he                     255"
11424,THE BROTHERS [A],"Inclined to both by reason of his age,"
11425,THE BROTHERS [A],"With a more fond, familiar, tenderness;"
11426,THE BROTHERS [A],"They, notwithstanding, had much love to spare, [28]"
11427,THE BROTHERS [A],And it all went into each other's hearts.
11428,THE BROTHERS [A],"Leonard, the elder by just eighteen months,                   260"
11429,THE BROTHERS [A],"Was two years taller: 'twas a joy to see,"
11430,THE BROTHERS [A],"To hear, to meet them!--From their house the school"
11431,THE BROTHERS [A],"Is [29] distant three short miles, and in the time"
11432,THE BROTHERS [A],"Of storm and thaw, when every water-course"
11433,THE BROTHERS [A],"And unbridged stream, such as you may have noticed            265"
11434,THE BROTHERS [A],"Crossing our roads at every hundred steps,"
11435,THE BROTHERS [A],Was swoln into a noisy rivulet
11436,THE BROTHERS [A],"Would Leonard then, when elder boys remained"
11437,THE BROTHERS [A],"At home, go staggering through the slippery fords, [30]"
11438,THE BROTHERS [A],"Bearing his brother on his back. I have [31] seen him,        270"
11439,THE BROTHERS [A],"On windy days, in one of those stray brooks,"
11440,THE BROTHERS [A],"Ay, more than once I have [31] seen him, mid-leg deep,"
11441,THE BROTHERS [A],"Their two books lying both on a dry stone,"
11442,THE BROTHERS [A],"Upon the hither side: and once I said,"
11443,THE BROTHERS [A],"As I remember, looking round these rocks                      275"
11444,THE BROTHERS [A],"And hills on which we all of us were born,"
11445,THE BROTHERS [A],That God who made the great book of the world
11446,THE BROTHERS [A],Would bless such piety--
11447,THE BROTHERS [A],
11448,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_.              It may be then--
11449,THE BROTHERS [A],
11450,THE BROTHERS [A],_Priest_. Never did worthier lads break English bread;        280
11451,THE BROTHERS [A],The very brightest Sunday Autumn saw [32]
11452,THE BROTHERS [A],"With all its mealy clusters of ripe nuts,"
11453,THE BROTHERS [A],"Could never keep those [33] boys away from church,"
11454,THE BROTHERS [A],Or tempt them to an hour of sabbath breach.
11455,THE BROTHERS [A],"Leonard and James! I warrant, every corner                    285"
11456,THE BROTHERS [A],"Among these rocks, and every hollow place"
11457,THE BROTHERS [A],"That venturous foot could reach, to one or both [34]"
11458,THE BROTHERS [A],Was known as well as to the flowers that grow there.
11459,THE BROTHERS [A],Like roe-bucks they went bounding o'er the hills;
11460,THE BROTHERS [A],They played like two young ravens on the crags:               290
11461,THE BROTHERS [A],"Then they could write, ay and speak too, as well"
11462,THE BROTHERS [A],As many of their betters--and for Leonard!
11463,THE BROTHERS [A],"The very night before he went away,"
11464,THE BROTHERS [A],In my own house I put into his hand
11465,THE BROTHERS [A],"A bible, and I'd wager house and field                        295"
11466,THE BROTHERS [A],"That, if he be alive, he has it yet. [35]"
11467,THE BROTHERS [A],
11468,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Leonard_. It seems, these Brothers have not lived to be"
11469,THE BROTHERS [A],A comfort to each other--
11470,THE BROTHERS [A],
11471,THE BROTHERS [A],_Priest_.           That they might
11472,THE BROTHERS [A],Live to such end [36] is what both old and young              300
11473,THE BROTHERS [A],"In this our valley all of us have wished,"
11474,THE BROTHERS [A],"And what, for my part, I have often prayed:"
11475,THE BROTHERS [A],But Leonard--
11476,THE BROTHERS [A],
11477,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_.     Then James still is left among you!
11478,THE BROTHERS [A],
11479,THE BROTHERS [A],_Priest_. 'Tis of the elder brother I am speaking:            305
11480,THE BROTHERS [A],They had an uncle;--he was at that time
11481,THE BROTHERS [A],"A thriving man, and trafficked on the seas:"
11482,THE BROTHERS [A],"And, but for that [37] same uncle, to this hour"
11483,THE BROTHERS [A],Leonard had never handled rope or shroud:
11484,THE BROTHERS [A],For the boy loved the life which we lead here;                310
11485,THE BROTHERS [A],"And though of unripe years, a stripling only, [38]"
11486,THE BROTHERS [A],His soul was knit to this his native soil.
11487,THE BROTHERS [A],"But, as I said, old Walter was too weak"
11488,THE BROTHERS [A],"To strive with such a torrent; when he died,"
11489,THE BROTHERS [A],"The estate and house were sold; and all their sheep,          315"
11490,THE BROTHERS [A],"A pretty flock, and which, for aught I know,"
11491,THE BROTHERS [A],Had clothed the Ewbanks for a thousand years:--
11492,THE BROTHERS [A],"Well--all was gone, and they were destitute,"
11493,THE BROTHERS [A],"And Leonard, chiefly for his Brother's sake,"
11494,THE BROTHERS [A],Resolved to try his fortune on the seas.                      320
11495,THE BROTHERS [A],Twelve years are past [39] since we had tidings from him.
11496,THE BROTHERS [A],If there were [40] one among us who had heard
11497,THE BROTHERS [A],"That Leonard Ewbank was come home again,"
11498,THE BROTHERS [A],"From the Great Gavel, [G] down by Leeza's banks,"
11499,THE BROTHERS [A],"And down the Enna, far as Egremont.                           325"
11500,THE BROTHERS [A],The day would be a joyous festival; [41]
11501,THE BROTHERS [A],"And those two bells of ours, which there you see--"
11502,THE BROTHERS [A],"Hanging in the open air--but, O good Sir!"
11503,THE BROTHERS [A],This is sad talk--they'll never sound for him--
11504,THE BROTHERS [A],"Living or dead.--When last we heard of him,                   330"
11505,THE BROTHERS [A],He was in slavery among the Moors
11506,THE BROTHERS [A],Upon the Barbary coast.--'Twas not a little
11507,THE BROTHERS [A],"That would bring down his spirit; and no doubt,"
11508,THE BROTHERS [A],"Before it ended in his death, the Youth [42]"
11509,THE BROTHERS [A],"Was sadly crossed.--Poor Leonard! when we parted,             335"
11510,THE BROTHERS [A],"He took me by the hand, and said to me,"
11511,THE BROTHERS [A],"If e'er he should grow rich, he would return,"
11512,THE BROTHERS [A],"To live in peace upon his father's land,"
11513,THE BROTHERS [A],And lay his bones among us. [43]
11514,THE BROTHERS [A],
11515,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_.             If that day                            340
11516,THE BROTHERS [A],"Should come, 'twould needs be a glad day for him;"
11517,THE BROTHERS [A],"He would himself, no doubt, be happy then"
11518,THE BROTHERS [A],As any that should meet him--
11519,THE BROTHERS [A],
11520,THE BROTHERS [A],_Priest_.                Happy! Sir--
11521,THE BROTHERS [A],
11522,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Leonard_. You said his kindred all were in their graves,     345"
11523,THE BROTHERS [A],And that he had one Brother--
11524,THE BROTHERS [A],
11525,THE BROTHERS [A],_Priest_.               That is but
11526,THE BROTHERS [A],A fellow-tale of sorrow. From his youth
11527,THE BROTHERS [A],"James, though not sickly, yet was delicate;"
11528,THE BROTHERS [A],And Leonard being always by his side                          350
11529,THE BROTHERS [A],"Had done so many offices about him,"
11530,THE BROTHERS [A],"That, though he was not of a timid nature,"
11531,THE BROTHERS [A],Yet still the spirit of a mountain-boy
11532,THE BROTHERS [A],"In him was somewhat checked; and, when his Brother"
11533,THE BROTHERS [A],"Was gone to sea, and he was left alone,                       355"
11534,THE BROTHERS [A],The little colour that he had was soon
11535,THE BROTHERS [A],"Stolen from his cheek; he drooped, and pined, and pined--"
11536,THE BROTHERS [A],
11537,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_. But these are all the graves of full-grown men!
11538,THE BROTHERS [A],
11539,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_. Ay, Sir, that passed away: we took him to us;"
11540,THE BROTHERS [A],He was the child of all the dale--he lived                    360
11541,THE BROTHERS [A],"Three months with one, and six months with another;"
11542,THE BROTHERS [A],"And wanted neither food, nor clothes, nor love:"
11543,THE BROTHERS [A],"And many, many happy days were his."
11544,THE BROTHERS [A],"But, whether blithe or sad, 'tis my belief"
11545,THE BROTHERS [A],His absent Brother still was at his heart.                    365
11546,THE BROTHERS [A],"And, when he dwelt [44] beneath our roof, we found"
11547,THE BROTHERS [A],(A practice till this time unknown to him)
11548,THE BROTHERS [A],"That often, rising from his bed at night,"
11549,THE BROTHERS [A],"He in his sleep would walk about, and sleeping"
11550,THE BROTHERS [A],He sought his brother Leonard.--You are moved!                370
11551,THE BROTHERS [A],"Forgive me, Sir: before I spoke to you,"
11552,THE BROTHERS [A],I judged you most unkindly.
11553,THE BROTHERS [A],
11554,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Leonard_.             But this Youth,"
11555,THE BROTHERS [A],How did he die at last?
11556,THE BROTHERS [A],
11557,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_.          One sweet May-morning,                     375"
11558,THE BROTHERS [A],(It will be twelve years since when Spring returns)
11559,THE BROTHERS [A],"He had gone forth among the new-dropped lambs,"
11560,THE BROTHERS [A],"With two or three companions, whom their course"
11561,THE BROTHERS [A],Of occupation led from height to height
11562,THE BROTHERS [A],"Under a cloudless sun--till he, at length,                    380"
11563,THE BROTHERS [A],"Through weariness, or, haply, to indulge"
11564,THE BROTHERS [A],"The humour of the moment, lagged behind. [45]"
11565,THE BROTHERS [A],You see yon precipice;--it wears the shape
11566,THE BROTHERS [A],Of a vast building made of many crags; [46]
11567,THE BROTHERS [A],And in the midst is one particular rock                       385
11568,THE BROTHERS [A],"That rises like a column from the vale,"
11569,THE BROTHERS [A],"Whence by our shepherds it is called, THE PILLAR."
11570,THE BROTHERS [A],"Upon its aÃ«ry summit crowned with heath,"
11571,THE BROTHERS [A],"The loiterer, not unnoticed by his comrades,"
11572,THE BROTHERS [A],"Lay stretched at ease; but, passing by the place              390"
11573,THE BROTHERS [A],"On their return, they found that he was gone."
11574,THE BROTHERS [A],No ill was feared; till one of them by chance
11575,THE BROTHERS [A],"Entering, when evening was far spent, the house"
11576,THE BROTHERS [A],"Which at that time was James's home, there learned [47]"
11577,THE BROTHERS [A],That nobody had seen him all that day: [H]                    395
11578,THE BROTHERS [A],"The morning came, and still he was unheard of:"
11579,THE BROTHERS [A],"The neighbours were alarmed, and to the brook"
11580,THE BROTHERS [A],Some hastened; some ran to the lake: [48] ere noon
11581,THE BROTHERS [A],They found him at the foot of that same rock
11582,THE BROTHERS [A],"Dead, and with mangled limbs. The third day after             400"
11583,THE BROTHERS [A],"I buried him, poor Youth, [49] and there he lies!"
11584,THE BROTHERS [A],
11585,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_. And that then _is_ his grave!--Before his death
11586,THE BROTHERS [A],You say [50] that he saw many happy years?
11587,THE BROTHERS [A],
11588,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_. Ay, that he did--"
11589,THE BROTHERS [A],
11590,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_.                 And all went well with him?--405
11591,THE BROTHERS [A],
11592,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_. If he had one, the Youth [51] had twenty homes."
11593,THE BROTHERS [A],
11594,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Leonard_. And you believe, then, that his mind was easy?--"
11595,THE BROTHERS [A],
11596,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_. Yes, long before he died, he found that time"
11597,THE BROTHERS [A],Is a true friend to sorrow; and unless
11598,THE BROTHERS [A],"His thoughts were turned on Leonard's luckless fortune,       410"
11599,THE BROTHERS [A],He talked about him with a cheerful love.
11600,THE BROTHERS [A],
11601,THE BROTHERS [A],_Leonard_. He could not come to an unhallowed end!
11602,THE BROTHERS [A],
11603,THE BROTHERS [A],"_Priest_. Nay, God forbid!--You recollect I mentioned"
11604,THE BROTHERS [A],A habit which disquietude and grief
11605,THE BROTHERS [A],Had brought upon him; and we all conjectured                  415
11606,THE BROTHERS [A],"That, as the day was warm, he had lain down"
11607,THE BROTHERS [A],"On the soft heath, [52] and, waiting for his comrades,"
11608,THE BROTHERS [A],He there had fallen asleep; that in his sleep
11609,THE BROTHERS [A],He to the margin of the precipice
11610,THE BROTHERS [A],"Had walked, and from the summit had fallen headlong:          420"
11611,THE BROTHERS [A],And so no doubt he perished. When the Youth
11612,THE BROTHERS [A],"Fell, in his hand he must have grasp'd, we think, [53]"
11613,THE BROTHERS [A],His shepherd's staff; for on that Pillar of rock
11614,THE BROTHERS [A],It had been caught mid way; and there for years [54]
11615,THE BROTHERS [A],It hung;--and mouldered there.                                425
11616,THE BROTHERS [A],
11617,THE BROTHERS [A],The Priest here ended--
11618,THE BROTHERS [A],"The Stranger would have thanked him, but he felt"
11619,THE BROTHERS [A],"A gushing from his heart, that took away"
11620,THE BROTHERS [A],The power of speech. Both left the spot in silence; [55]
11621,THE BROTHERS [A],"And Leonard, when they reached the church-yard gate,          430"
11622,THE BROTHERS [A],"As the Priest lifted up the latch, turned round,--"
11623,THE BROTHERS [A],"And, looking at the grave, he said, ""My Brother!"""
11624,THE BROTHERS [A],"The Vicar did not hear the words: and now,"
11625,THE BROTHERS [A],"He pointed towards his dwelling-place, entreating [56]"
11626,THE BROTHERS [A],That Leonard would partake his homely fare:                   435
11627,THE BROTHERS [A],The other thanked him with an earnest [57] voice;
11628,THE BROTHERS [A],"But added, that, the evening being calm,"
11629,THE BROTHERS [A],He would pursue his journey. So they parted.
11630,THE BROTHERS [A],
11631,THE BROTHERS [A],It was not long ere Leonard reached a grove
11632,THE BROTHERS [A],"That overhung the road: he there stopped short,               440"
11633,THE BROTHERS [A],"And, sitting down beneath the trees, reviewed"
11634,THE BROTHERS [A],All that the Priest had said: his early years
11635,THE BROTHERS [A],"Were with him:--his long absence, cherished hopes, [58]"
11636,THE BROTHERS [A],"And thoughts which had been his an hour before,"
11637,THE BROTHERS [A],"All pressed on him with such a weight, that now,              445"
11638,THE BROTHERS [A],"This vale, where he had been so happy, seemed"
11639,THE BROTHERS [A],A place in which he could not bear to live:
11640,THE BROTHERS [A],So he relinquished all his purposes.
11641,THE BROTHERS [A],"He travelled back [59] to Egremont: and thence,"
11642,THE BROTHERS [A],"That night, he wrote a letter to the Priest, [60]             450"
11643,THE BROTHERS [A],Reminding him of what had passed between them;
11644,THE BROTHERS [A],"And adding, with a hope to be forgiven,"
11645,THE BROTHERS [A],That it was from the weakness of his heart
11646,THE BROTHERS [A],He had not dared to tell him who he was.
11647,THE BROTHERS [A],"This done, he went on shipboard, and is now                   455"
11648,THE BROTHERS [A],"A Seaman, a grey-headed Mariner."

12968,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Up the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,"
12969,A PASTORAL POEM [A],You will suppose that with an upright path
12970,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Your feet must struggle; in such bold ascent
12971,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The pastoral mountains front you, face to face.                     5"
12972,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"But, courage! for around [1] that boisterous brook"
12973,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The mountains have all opened out themselves,"
12974,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And made a hidden valley of their own.
12975,A PASTORAL POEM [A],No habitation can be seen; but they
12976,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Who journey thither find themselves alone [2]                      10
12977,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"With a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites"
12978,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That overhead are sailing in the sky.
12979,A PASTORAL POEM [A],It is in truth an utter solitude;
12980,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Nor should I have made mention of this Dell
12981,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"But for one object which you might pass by,                        15"
12982,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Might see and notice not. Beside the brook
12983,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Appears [3] a straggling heap of unhewn stones!
12984,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And to that simple object appertains
12985,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"A story--unenriched with strange events,"
12986,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Yet not unfit, I deem, for the fireside, [4]                       20"
12987,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Or for the summer shade. It was the first
12988,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Of those domestic tales that spake to me [5]
12989,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of Shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men"
12990,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Whom I already loved;--not verily
12991,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"For their own sakes, but for the fields and hills                  25"
12992,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Where was their occupation and abode.
12993,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And hence this Tale, while I was yet a Boy"
12994,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Careless of books, yet having felt the power"
12995,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of Nature, by the gentle agency"
12996,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of natural objects, led me on to feel                              30"
12997,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"For passions that were not my own, and think"
12998,A PASTORAL POEM [A],(At random and imperfectly indeed)
12999,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"On man, the heart of man, and human life."
13000,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Therefore, although it be a history"
13001,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Homely and rude, I will relate the same                            35"
13002,A PASTORAL POEM [A],For the delight of a few natural hearts;
13003,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake"
13004,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of youthful Poets, who among these hills"
13005,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Will be my second self when I am gone.
13006,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13007,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Upon the forest-side in Grasmere Vale                            40
13008,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"There dwelt a Shepherd, Michael was his name;"
13009,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb."
13010,A PASTORAL POEM [A],His bodily frame had been from youth to age
13011,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen,"
13012,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,                          45"
13013,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And in his shepherd's calling he was prompt
13014,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And watchful more than ordinary men.
13015,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Hence had he learned [6] the meaning of all winds,"
13016,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of blasts of every tone; and, oftentimes,"
13017,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"When others heeded not, He heard the South                         50"
13018,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Make subterraneous music, like the noise"
13019,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.
13020,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The Shepherd, at such warning, of his flock"
13021,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Bethought him, and he to himself would say,"
13022,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"""The winds are now devising work for me!""                          55"
13023,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives"
13024,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The traveller to a shelter, summoned him"
13025,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Up to the mountains: he had been alone
13026,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Amid the heart of many thousand mists,"
13027,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That came to him, and left him, on the heights.                    60"
13028,A PASTORAL POEM [A],So lived he till his eightieth year was past.
13029,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And grossly that man errs, who should suppose"
13030,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,"
13031,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Were things indifferent to the Shepherd's thoughts.
13032,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed                65"
13033,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The common air; hills, which with vigorous step"
13034,A PASTORAL POEM [A],He had so often climbed; [7] which had impressed
13035,A PASTORAL POEM [A],So many incidents upon his mind
13036,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;"
13037,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Which, like a book, preserved the memory                           70"
13038,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of the dumb animals, whom he had saved,"
13039,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts"
13040,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The certainty of honourable gain;
13041,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Those fields, those hills--what could they less? had laid [8]"
13042,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Strong hold on his affections, were to him                         75"
13043,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"A pleasurable feeling of blind love,"
13044,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The pleasure which there is in life itself.
13045,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13046,A PASTORAL POEM [A],His days had not been passed in singleness.
13047,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"His Helpmate was a comely matron, old--[9]"
13048,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Though younger than himself full twenty years.                     80
13049,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"She was a woman of a stirring life,"
13050,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Whose heart was in her house: two wheels she had
13051,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of antique form; this large, for spinning wool;"
13052,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That small, for flax; and if one wheel had rest,"
13053,A PASTORAL POEM [A],It was because the other was at work.                              85
13054,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The Pair had but one inmate in their house,"
13055,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"An only Child, who had been born to them"
13056,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"When Michael, telling o'er his years, began"
13057,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"To deem that he was old,--in shepherd's phrase,"
13058,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"With one foot in the grave. This only Son,                         90"
13059,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,"
13060,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The one of an inestimable worth,"
13061,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Made all their household. I may truly say,"
13062,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That they were as a proverb in the vale
13063,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"For endless industry. When day was gone,                           95"
13064,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And from their occupations out of doors
13065,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The Son and Father were come home, even then,"
13066,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Their labour did not cease; unless when all
13067,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Turned to the [10] cleanly supper-board, and there,"
13068,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,                     100"
13069,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Sat round the [11] basket piled with oaten cakes,"
13070,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when the [12] meal
13071,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Was ended, Luke (for so the Son was named)"
13072,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And his old Father both betook themselves
13073,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To such convenient work as might employ                           105
13074,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Their hands by the fire-side; perhaps to card
13075,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Wool for the Housewife's spindle, or repair"
13076,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,"
13077,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Or other implement of house or field.
13078,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13079,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge,                     110"
13080,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That [13] in our ancient uncouth country style
13081,A PASTORAL POEM [A],With huge and black projection overbrowed [14]
13082,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Large space beneath, as duly as the light"
13083,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Of day grew dim the Housewife hung a lamp;
13084,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"An aged utensil, which had performed                              115"
13085,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Service beyond all others of its kind.
13086,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Early at evening did it burn--and late,"
13087,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Surviving comrade of uncounted hours,"
13088,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Which, going by from year to year, had found,"
13089,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And left the couple neither gay perhaps                           120
13090,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,"
13091,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Living a life of eager industry.
13092,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And now, when Luke had reached his [15] eighteenth year,"
13093,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"There by the light of this old lamp they sate,"
13094,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Father and Son, while far [16] into the night                     125"
13095,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The Housewife plied her own peculiar work,"
13096,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Making the cottage through the silent hours
13097,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Murmur as with the sound of summer flies. [B]
13098,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"[17] This [18] light was famous in its neighbourhood,"
13099,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And was a public symbol of the life                               130
13100,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That [19] thrifty Pair had lived. For, as it chanced,"
13101,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Their cottage on a plot of rising ground
13102,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Stood single, with large prospect, north and south,"
13103,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"High into Easedale, up to Dunmail-Raise,"
13104,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And westward to the village near the lake;                        135
13105,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And from this constant light, so regular"
13106,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And so far seen, the House itself, by all"
13107,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Who dwelt within the limits of the vale,"
13108,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Both old and young, was named THE EVENING STAR."
13109,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13110,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Thus living on through such a length of years,                  140"
13111,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The Shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs"
13112,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Have loved his Helpmate; but to Michael's heart
13113,A PASTORAL POEM [A],This son of his old age was yet more dear--
13114,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Less from instinctive tenderness, [20] the same"
13115,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all--[21]          145
13116,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Than [22] that a child, more than all other gifts"
13117,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That earth can offer to declining man, [23]"
13118,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,"
13119,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And stirrings of inquietude, when they"
13120,A PASTORAL POEM [A],By tendency of nature needs must fail.                            150
13121,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"[24] Exceeding was the love he bare to him,"
13122,A PASTORAL POEM [A],His heart and his heart's joy! For oftentimes
13123,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Old Michael, while he was a babe in arms,"
13124,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Had done him female service, not alone"
13125,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"For pastime [25] and delight, as is the use                       155"
13126,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced"
13127,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To acts of tenderness; and he had rocked
13128,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"His cradle, as with a woman's gentle hand. [26]"
13129,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And, in a later time, ere yet the Boy"
13130,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Had put on boy's attire, did Michael love,                        160"
13131,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Albeit of a stern unbending mind,"
13132,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"To have the Young-one in his sight, when he"
13133,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Wrought in the field, or on his shepherd's stool"
13134,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Sate with a fettered sheep before him stretched
13135,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Under the large old oak, that near his door                       165"
13136,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Stood single, and, from matchless depth of shade, [27]"
13137,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Chosen for the Shearer's covert from the sun,"
13138,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Thence in our rustic dialect was called
13139,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The CLIPPING TREE, [C] a name which yet it bears."
13140,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"There, while they two were sitting in the shade,                  170"
13141,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"With others round them, earnest all and blithe,"
13142,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Would Michael exercise his heart with looks
13143,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Of fond correction and reproof bestowed
13144,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Upon the Child, if he disturbed the sheep"
13145,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"By catching at their legs, or with his shouts                     175"
13146,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears."
13147,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13148,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And when by Heaven's good grace the boy grew up
13149,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"A healthy Lad, and carried in his cheek"
13150,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Two steady roses that were five years old;
13151,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Then Michael from a winter coppice cut                            180
13152,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"With his own hand a sapling, which he hooped"
13153,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"With iron, making it throughout in all"
13154,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff,"
13155,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And gave it to the Boy; wherewith equipt
13156,A PASTORAL POEM [A],He as a watchman oftentimes was placed                            185
13157,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock;"
13158,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And, to his office prematurely called,"
13159,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"There stood the urchin, as you will divine,"
13160,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Something between a hindrance and a help;
13161,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And for this cause not always, I believe,                         190"
13162,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Receiving from his Father hire of praise;
13163,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Though nought was left undone which staff, or voice,"
13164,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Or looks, or threatening gestures, could perform."
13165,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13166,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand"
13167,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Against the mountain blasts; and to the heights,                  200"
13168,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,"
13169,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"He with his Father daily went, and they"
13170,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Were as companions, why should I relate"
13171,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That objects which the Shepherd loved before
13172,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Were dearer now? that from the Boy there came                     205
13173,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Feelings and emanations--things which were
13174,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Light to the sun and music to the wind;
13175,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And that the old Man's heart seemed born again?
13176,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13177,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Thus in his Father's sight the Boy grew up:
13178,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And now, when he had reached his eighteenth year,                 210"
13179,A PASTORAL POEM [A],He was his comfort and his daily hope. [D]
13180,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13181,A PASTORAL POEM [A],While in this sort the simple household lived [28]
13182,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"From day to day, to Michael's ear there came"
13183,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Distressful tidings. Long before the time
13184,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound                     215"
13185,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"In surety for his brother's son, a man"
13186,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Of an industrious life, and ample means;"
13187,A PASTORAL POEM [A],But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly
13188,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Had prest upon him; and old Michael now
13189,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture,                         220"
13190,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"A grievous penalty, but little less"
13191,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim,"
13192,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"At the first hearing, for a moment took"
13193,A PASTORAL POEM [A],More hope out of his life than he supposed
13194,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That any old man ever could have lost.                            225
13195,A PASTORAL POEM [A],As soon as he had armed himself with strength
13196,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"To look his trouble in the face, it seemed"
13197,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The Shepherd's sole resource to sell at once [29]
13198,A PASTORAL POEM [A],A portion of his patrimonial fields.
13199,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Such was his first resolve; he thought again,                     230"
13200,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And his heart failed him. ""Isabel,"" said he,"
13201,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Two evenings after he had heard the news,"
13202,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"""I have been toiling more than seventy years,"
13203,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And in the open sunshine of God's love
13204,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Have we all lived; yet if these fields of ours                    235
13205,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Should pass into a stranger's hand, I think"
13206,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That I could not lie quiet in my grave.
13207,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself [30]
13208,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Has scarcely been more diligent than I;
13209,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And I have lived to be a fool at last                             240
13210,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To my own family. An evil man
13211,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That was, and made an evil choice, if he"
13212,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Were false to us; and if he were not false,"
13213,A PASTORAL POEM [A],There are ten thousand to whom loss like this
13214,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Had been no sorrow. I forgive him;--but                           245
13215,A PASTORAL POEM [A],'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.
13216,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13217,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"""When I began, my purpose was to speak"
13218,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Of remedies and of a cheerful hope.
13219,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land"
13220,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Shall not go from us, and it shall be free;                       250"
13221,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"He shall possess it, free as is the wind"
13222,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That passes over it. We have, thou know'st,"
13223,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Another kinsman--he will be our friend
13224,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"In this distress. He is a prosperous man,"
13225,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Thriving in trade--and Luke to him shall go,                      255"
13226,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And with his kinsman's help and his own thrift
13227,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"He quickly will repair this loss, and then"
13228,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"He may return to us. [31] If here he stay,"
13229,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"What can be done? Where every one is poor,"
13230,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"What can be gained?""                                              260"
13231,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"At this the old Man paused,"
13232,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And Isabel sat silent, for her mind"
13233,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Was busy, looking back into past times."
13234,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"There's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself, [E]"
13235,A PASTORAL POEM [A],He was a parish-boy--at the church-door                           265
13236,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence"
13237,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought"
13238,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"A basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;"
13239,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And, with this basket on his arm, the lad"
13240,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Went up to London, found a master there,                          270"
13241,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Who, out of many, chose the trusty boy"
13242,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To go and overlook his merchandise
13243,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich,"
13244,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And left estates and monies to the poor,"
13245,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And, at his birth-place, built a chapel floored                   275"
13246,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"With marble, which he sent from foreign lands."
13247,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"These thoughts, and many others of like sort,"
13248,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel,"
13249,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And her face brightened. The old Man was glad,"
13250,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And thus resumed:--""Well, Isabel! this scheme                     280"
13251,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"These two days, has been meat and drink to me."
13252,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Far more than we have lost is left us yet.
13253,A PASTORAL POEM [A],--We have enough--I wish indeed that I
13254,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Were younger;--but this hope is a good hope.
13255,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best                      285"
13256,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Buy for him more, and let us send him forth"
13257,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night:"
13258,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"--If he _could_ [32] go, the Boy should go to-night."""
13259,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13260,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth"
13261,A PASTORAL POEM [A],With a light heart. [F] The Housewife for five days               290
13262,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Was restless morn and night, and all day long"
13263,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare
13264,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Things needful for the journey of her son.
13265,A PASTORAL POEM [A],But Isabel was glad when Sunday came
13266,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"To stop her in her work: for, when she lay                        295"
13267,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"By Michael's side, she through the last two nights [33]"
13268,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep:"
13269,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And when they rose at morning she could see
13270,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon
13271,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"She said to Luke, while they two by themselves                    300"
13272,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Were sitting at the door, ""Thou must not go:"
13273,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"We have no other Child but thee to lose,"
13274,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"None to remember--do not go away,"
13275,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"For if thou leave thy Father he will die."""
13276,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The Youth [34] made answer with a jocund voice;                   305
13277,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And Isabel, when she had told her fears,"
13278,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Recovered heart. That evening her best fare
13279,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Did she bring forth, and all together sat"
13280,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Like happy people round a Christmas fire.
13281,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13282,A PASTORAL POEM [A],With daylight [35] Isabel resumed her work;                       310
13283,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And all the ensuing week the house appeared
13284,A PASTORAL POEM [A],As cheerful as a grove in Spring: at length
13285,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The expected letter from their kinsman came,"
13286,A PASTORAL POEM [A],With kind assurances that he would do
13287,A PASTORAL POEM [A],His utmost for the welfare of the Boy;                            315
13288,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"To which, requests were added, that forthwith"
13289,A PASTORAL POEM [A],He might be sent to him. Ten times or more
13290,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The letter was read over; Isabel
13291,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Went forth to show it to the neighbours round;
13292,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Nor was there at that time on English land                        320
13293,A PASTORAL POEM [A],A prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel
13294,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Had to her house returned, the old Man said,"
13295,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"""He shall depart to-morrow."" To this word"
13296,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The Housewife answered, talking much of things"
13297,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Which, if at such short notice he should go,                      325"
13298,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Would surely be forgotten. But at length
13299,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"She gave consent, and Michael was at ease."
13300,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13301,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Near the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,"
13302,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"In that deep valley, Michael had designed"
13303,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"To build a Sheep-fold; [G] and, before he heard                   330"
13304,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The tidings of his melancholy loss,"
13305,A PASTORAL POEM [A],For this same purpose he had gathered up
13306,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"A heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge [36]"
13307,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Lay thrown together, ready for the work."
13308,A PASTORAL POEM [A],With Luke that evening thitherward he walked:                     335
13309,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And soon as they had reached the place he stopped,"
13310,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And thus the old Man spake to him:--""My Son,"
13311,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To-morrow thou wilt leave me: with full heart
13312,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"I look upon thee, for thou art the same"
13313,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That wert a promise to me ere thy birth,                          340"
13314,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And all thy life hast been my daily joy.
13315,A PASTORAL POEM [A],I will relate to thee some little part
13316,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Of our two histories; 'twill do thee good
13317,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"When thou art from me, even if I should touch"
13318,A PASTORAL POEM [A],On things [37] thou canst not know of.--After thou                345
13319,A PASTORAL POEM [A],First cam'st into the world--as oft befals [38]
13320,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To new-born infants--thou didst sleep away
13321,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Two days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue"
13322,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on,"
13323,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And still I loved thee with increasing love.                      350
13324,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Never to living ear came sweeter sounds
13325,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Than when I heard thee by our own fire-side
13326,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"First uttering, without words, a natural tune;"
13327,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"While [39] thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy"
13328,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Sing at thy Mother's breast. Month followed month,                355"
13329,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And in the open fields my life was passed
13330,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And on [40] the mountains; else I think that thou
13331,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Hadst been brought up upon thy Father's knees.
13332,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"But we were playmates, Luke: among these hills,"
13333,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"As well thou knowest, in us the old and young                     360"
13334,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Have played together, nor with me didst thou"
13335,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Lack any pleasure which a boy can know."""
13336,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Luke had a manly heart; but at these words
13337,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"He sobbed aloud. The old Man grasped his hand,"
13338,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And said, ""Nay, do not take it so--I see                          365"
13339,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That these are things of which I need not speak.
13340,A PASTORAL POEM [A],--Even to the utmost I have been to thee
13341,A PASTORAL POEM [A],A kind and a good Father: and herein
13342,A PASTORAL POEM [A],I but repay a gift which I myself
13343,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Received at others' hands; for, though now old                    370"
13344,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Beyond the common life of man, I still"
13345,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Remember them who loved me in my youth.
13346,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Both of them sleep together: here they lived,"
13347,A PASTORAL POEM [A],As all their Forefathers had done; and when
13348,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"At length their time was come, they were not loth                 375"
13349,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To give their bodies to the family mould.
13350,A PASTORAL POEM [A],I wished that thou should'st live the life they lived:
13351,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"But, 'tis a long time to look back, my Son,"
13352,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And see so little gain from threescore years. [41]
13353,A PASTORAL POEM [A],These fields were burthened when they came to me;                 380
13354,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Till I was forty years of age, not more"
13355,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Than half of my inheritance was mine.
13356,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"I toiled and toiled; God blessed me in my work,"
13357,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And till these three weeks past the land was free.
13358,A PASTORAL POEM [A],--It looks as if it never could endure                            385
13359,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Another Master. Heaven forgive me, Luke,"
13360,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good"
13361,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That thou should'st go,"""
13362,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13363,A PASTORAL POEM [A],At this the old Man paused;
13364,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Then, pointing to the stones near which they stood,               390"
13365,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Thus, after a short silence, he resumed:"
13366,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"""This was a work for us; and now, my Son,"
13367,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"It is a work for me. But, lay one stone--"
13368,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands."
13369,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"[42] Nay, Boy, be of good hope;--we both may live                 395"
13370,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To see a better day. At eighty-four
13371,A PASTORAL POEM [A],I still am strong and hale [43];--do thou thy part;
13372,A PASTORAL POEM [A],I will do mine.--I will begin again
13373,A PASTORAL POEM [A],With many tasks that were resigned to thee:
13374,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Up to the heights, and in among the storms,                       400"
13375,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Will I without thee go again, and do"
13376,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"All works which I was wont to do alone,"
13377,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Before I knew thy face.--Heaven bless thee, Boy!"
13378,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast
13379,A PASTORAL POEM [A],With many hopes; it should be so--yes--yes--405
13380,A PASTORAL POEM [A],I knew that thou could'st never have a wish
13381,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"To leave me, Luke: thou hast been bound to me"
13382,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Only by links of love: when thou art gone,"
13383,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"What will be left to us!--But, I forget"
13384,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone,                            410"
13385,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"As I requested; and hereafter, Luke,"
13386,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"When thou art gone away, should evil men"
13387,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Be thy companions, think of me, my Son,"
13388,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And of this moment; hither turn thy thoughts,"
13389,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And God will strengthen thee: amid all fear                       415
13390,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And all temptation, Luke, I pray that thou"
13391,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"May'st bear in mind the life thy Fathers lived, [44]"
13392,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Who, being innocent, did for that cause"
13393,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare thee well--"
13394,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"When thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see                  420"
13395,A PASTORAL POEM [A],A work which is not here: a covenant
13396,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"'Twill be between us; but, whatever fate"
13397,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Befal thee, I shall love thee to the last,"
13398,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And bear thy memory with me to the grave."""
13399,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13400,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The Shepherd ended here; and Luke stooped down,                   425"
13401,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And, as his Father had requested, laid"
13402,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The first stone of the Sheep-fold. At the sight
13403,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The old Man's grief broke from him; to his heart
13404,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"He pressed his Son, he kissÃ¨d him and wept;"
13405,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And to the house together they returned.                          430
13406,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"--Hushed was that House in peace, or seeming peace, [45]"
13407,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Ere the night fell:--with morrow's dawn the Boy [46]
13408,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Began his journey, and when he had reached"
13409,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The public way, he put on a bold face;"
13410,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And all the neighbours, as he passed their doors,                 435"
13411,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers,"
13412,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That followed him till he was out of sight.
13413,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13414,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"A good report did from their Kinsman come,"
13415,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Of Luke and his well doing: and the Boy
13416,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,                      440"
13417,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Which, as the Housewife phrased it, were throughout"
13418,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"""The prettiest letters that were ever seen."""
13419,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.
13420,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"So, many months passed on: and once again"
13421,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The Shepherd went about his daily work                            445
13422,A PASTORAL POEM [A],With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now
13423,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour
13424,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"He to that valley took his way, and there"
13425,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Wrought at the Sheep-fold. Meantime Luke began
13426,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"To slacken in his duty; and, at length,                           450"
13427,A PASTORAL POEM [A],He in the dissolute city gave himself
13428,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To evil courses: ignominy and shame
13429,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Fell on him, so that he was driven at last"
13430,A PASTORAL POEM [A],To seek a hiding-place beyond the seas.
13431,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13432,A PASTORAL POEM [A],There is a comfort in the strength of love;                       455
13433,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"'Twill make a thing endurable, which else"
13434,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Would overset the brain, or break the heart: [47]"
13435,A PASTORAL POEM [A],I have conversed with more than one who well
13436,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Remember the old Man, and what he was"
13437,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Years after he had heard this heavy news.                         460
13438,A PASTORAL POEM [A],His bodily frame had been from youth to age
13439,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks
13440,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"He went, and still looked up to sun and cloud, [48]"
13441,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And listened to the wind; and, as before,"
13442,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Performed all kinds of labour for his sheep,                      465"
13443,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"And for the land, his small inheritance."
13444,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And to that hollow dell from time to time
13445,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Did he repair, to build the Fold of which"
13446,A PASTORAL POEM [A],His flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet
13447,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The pity which was then in every heart                            470
13448,A PASTORAL POEM [A],For the old Man--and 'tis believed by all
13449,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"That many and many a day he thither went,"
13450,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And never lifted up a single stone.
13451,A PASTORAL POEM [A],
13452,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"There, by the Sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen"
13453,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Sitting alone, or with his faithful Dog, [49]                     475"
13454,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Then old, beside him, lying at his feet."
13455,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"The length of full seven years, from time to time,"
13456,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought,"
13457,A PASTORAL POEM [A],And left the work unfinished when he died.
13458,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Three years, or little more, did Isabel                           480"
13459,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Survive her Husband: at her death the estate
13460,A PASTORAL POEM [A],"Was sold, and went into a stranger's hand."
13461,A PASTORAL POEM [A],The Cottage which was named the EVENING STAR
13462,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Is gone--the ploughshare has been through the ground
13463,A PASTORAL POEM [A],On which it stood; great changes have been wrought                485
13464,A PASTORAL POEM [A],In all the neighbourhood:--yet the oak is left
13465,A PASTORAL POEM [A],That grew beside their door; and the remains
13466,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Of the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen
13467,A PASTORAL POEM [A],Beside the boisterous brook of Green-head Ghyll.

14284,MODERNISED,Wordsworth's modernisations of Chaucer were all written in 1801. Two of
14285,MODERNISED,"them were from the Canterbury Tales, but his version of one of"
14286,MODERNISED,these--'The Manciple's Tale'--has never been printed. Of the three poems
14287,MODERNISED,"which were published, the first--'The Prioress' Tale'--was included in"
14288,MODERNISED,the edition of 1820. The 'Troilus and Cressida' and 'The Cuckoo and the
14289,MODERNISED,"Nightingale' were included in the ""Poems of Early and Late Years"""
14290,MODERNISED,"(1842); but they had been published the year before, in a small volume"
14291,MODERNISED,"entitled 'The Poems of Geoffrey Chaucer Modernised' (London, 1841), a"
14292,MODERNISED,"volume to which Elizabeth Barrett, Leigh Hunt, R. H. Home, Thomas"
14293,MODERNISED,"Powell, and others contributed. Wordsworth wrote thus of the project to"
14294,MODERNISED,"Mr. Powell, in an unpublished and undated letter, written probably in"
14295,MODERNISED,1840:
14296,MODERNISED,
14297,MODERNISED,"""I am glad that you enter so warmly into the Chaucerian project, and"
14298,MODERNISED,that Mr. L. Hunt is disposed to give his valuable aid to it. For
14299,MODERNISED,"myself, I cannot do more than I offered, to place at your disposal"
14300,MODERNISED,"'The Prioress' Tale' already published, 'The Cuckoo and the"
14301,MODERNISED,"Nightingale', 'The Manciple's Tale', and I rather think (but I cannot"
14302,MODERNISED,just now find it) a small portion of the 'Troilus and Cressida'. You
14303,MODERNISED,"ask my opinion about that poem. Speaking from a recollection only, of"
14304,MODERNISED,"many years past, I should say it would be found too long and probably"
14305,MODERNISED,"tedious. 'The Knight's Tale' is also very long; but, though Dryden has"
14306,MODERNISED,"executed it, in his own way observe, with great spirit and harmony, he"
14307,MODERNISED,"has suffered so much of the simplicity, and with that of the beauty"
14308,MODERNISED,"and occasional pathos of the original to escape, that I should be"
14309,MODERNISED,pleased to hear that a new version was to be attempted upon my
14310,MODERNISED,principle by some competent person. It would delight me to read every
14311,MODERNISED,part of Chaucer over again--for I reverence and admire him above
14312,MODERNISED,measure--with a view to your work; but my eyes will not permit me to
14313,MODERNISED,do so. Who will undertake the Prologue to the Canterbury Tales? For
14314,MODERNISED,"your publication that is indispensable, and I fear it will prove very"
14315,MODERNISED,"difficult. It is written, as you know, in the couplet measure; and"
14316,MODERNISED,"therefore I have nothing to say upon its metre, but in respect to the"
14317,MODERNISED,"poems in stanza, neither in 'The Prioress' Tale' nor in 'The Cuckoo"
14318,MODERNISED,and Nightingale' have I kept to the rule of the original as to the
14319,MODERNISED,"form, and number, and position of the rhymes; thinking it enough if I"
14320,MODERNISED,"kept the same number of lines in each stanza; and this is, I think,"
14321,MODERNISED,"all that is necessary, and all that can be done without sacrificing"
14322,MODERNISED,"the substance of sense too often to the mere form of sound."""

14909,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Methought I wist right well what these birds meant,"
14910,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"And had good knowing both of their intent,"

14912,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14913,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,XXIII    The Nightingale thus in my hearing spake:--
14914,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Good Cuckoo, seek some other bush or brake,"
14915,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"And, prithee, let us that can sing dwell here;"
14916,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"For every wight eschews thy song to hear,"

14923,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"As thou dost in thy throat, I wot not how.                120"
14924,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14925,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXV      All men may understanding have of me,"
14926,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"But, Nightingale, so may they not of thee;"
14927,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,For thou hast many a foolish and quaint cry:--
14928,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Thou say'st, OSEE, OSEE, then how may I"
14929,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Have knowledge, I thee pray, what this may be?            125"
14930,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14931,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXVI     Ah, fool! quoth she, wist thou not what it is?"
14932,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Oft as I say OSEE, OSEE, I wis,"
14933,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Then mean I, that I should be wondrous fain"
14934,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"That shamefully they one and all were slain,"
14935,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,Whoever against Love mean aught amiss.                    130
14936,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14937,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXVII    And also would I that they all were dead,"
14938,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,Who do not think in love their life to lead;
14939,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"For who is both the God of Love to obey,"
14940,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Is only fit to die, I dare well say,"
14941,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,And for that cause OSEE I cry; take heed!                 135
14942,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14943,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXVIII   Ay, quoth the Cuckoo, that is a quaint law,"
14944,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"That all must love or die; but I withdraw,"
14945,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"And take my leave of all such company,"
14946,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"For mine intent it neither is to die,"
14947,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,Nor ever while I live Love's yoke to draw.                140
14948,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14949,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXIX     For lovers of all folk that be alive,"

14951,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Most feeling have of sorrow [3] woe and care,"
14952,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,And the least welfare cometh to their share;
14953,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,What need is there against the truth to strive?           145
14954,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14955,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXX      What! quoth she, thou art all out of thy mind,"
14956,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,That in thy churlishness a cause canst find
14957,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,To speak of Love's true Servants in this mood;
14958,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,For in this world no service is so good
14959,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,To every wight that gentle is of kind.                    150
14960,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14961,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,XXXI     For thereof comes all goodness and all worth;
14962,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,All gentiless [4] and honour thence come forth;
14963,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Thence worship comes, content and true heart's pleasure,"
14964,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"And full-assured trust, joy without measure,"
14965,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"And jollity, fresh cheerfulness, and mirth;               155"
14966,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14967,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXXII    And bounty, lowliness, and courtesy,"
14968,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"And seemliness, and faithful company,"
14969,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,And dread of shame that will not do amiss;
14970,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"For he that faithfully Love's servant is,"
14971,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Rather than be disgraced, would chuse to die.             160"
14972,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14973,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,XXXIII   And that the very truth it is which I
14974,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,Now say--in such belief I'll live and die;
14975,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"And Cuckoo, do thou so, by my advice."
14976,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Then, quoth she, let me never hope for bliss,"
14977,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,If with that counsel I do e'er comply.                    165
14978,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14979,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXXIV    Good Nightingale! thou speakest wondrous fair,"
14980,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Yet for all that, the truth is found elsewhere;"
14981,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"For Love in young folk is but rage, I wis;"
14982,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,And Love in old folk a great dotage is;
14983,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Who most it useth, him 'twill most impair.                170"
14984,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14985,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,XXXV     For thereof come all contraries to gladness;
14986,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Thence sickness comes, and overwhelming sadness,"
14987,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Mistrust and jealousy, despite, debate,"
14988,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Dishonour, shame, envy importunate,"
14989,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Pride, anger, mischief, poverty, and madness.             175"
14990,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14991,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXXVI    Loving is aye an office of despair,"
14992,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,And one thing is therein which is not fair;
14993,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"For whoso gets of love a little bliss,"
14994,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Unless it alway stay with him, I wis"
14995,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,He may full soon go with an old man's hair.               180
14996,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
14997,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXXVII   And, therefore, Nightingale! do thou keep nigh,"
14998,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"For trust me well, in spite of thy quaint cry,"
14999,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"If long time from thy mate thou be, or far,"
15000,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,Thou'lt be as others that forsaken are;
15001,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,Then shall thou raise a clamour as do I.                  185
15002,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
15003,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXXVIII  Fie, quoth she, on thy name, Bird ill beseen!"
15004,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"The God of Love afflict thee with all teen,"
15005,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,For thou art worse than mad a thousand fold;
15006,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"For many a one hath virtues manifold,"
15007,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"Who had been nought, if Love had never been.              190"
15008,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
15009,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XXXIX    For evermore his servants Love amendeth,"

15016,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,For Love no reason hath but his own will;--
15017,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,For to th' untrue he oft gives ease and joy;
15018,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"True lovers doth so bitterly annoy,"
15019,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,He lets them perish through that grievous ill.            200

15038,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,
15039,THE CUCKOO AND THE NIGHTINGALE,"XLIV     And so methought I started up anon,"

15320,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"For love of God, full piteously did say,"
15321,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,We must the Palace see of Cresida;                              5
15322,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"For since we yet may have no other feast,"
15323,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Let us behold her Palace at the least!
15324,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15325,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And therewithal to cover his intent
15326,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"A cause he found into the Town to go, [B]"
15327,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And they right forth to Cresid's Palace went;                  10
15328,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"But, Lord, this simple Troilus was woe,"
15329,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Him thought his sorrowful heart would break [1] in two;

15336,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"For which, with changÃ¨d, pale, and deadly face,"
15337,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Without word uttered, forth he 'gan to pace;"

15339,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,That no wight his continuance espied. [C]
15340,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15341,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Then said he thus,--O Palace desolate!"
15342,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"O house of houses, once so richly dight!"
15343,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,O Palace empty and disconsolate!
15344,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Thou lamp of which extinguished is the light;                  25
15345,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"O Palace whilom day that now art night,"
15346,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Thou ought'st to fall and I to die; since she
15347,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Is gone who held us both in sovereignty.
15348,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15349,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"O, of all houses once the crownÃ¨d boast!"
15350,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Palace illumined with the sun of bliss;                        30
15351,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"O ring of which the ruby now is lost,"
15352,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"O cause of woe, that cause has [2] been of bliss:"
15353,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Yet, since I may no better, would I kiss"
15354,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Thy cold doors; but I dare not for this rout;
15355,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Farewell, thou shrine of which the Saint is out!               35"
15356,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15357,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Therewith he cast on Pandarus an eye, [3]"
15358,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"With changed face, and piteous to behold;"
15359,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And when he might his time aright espy,"
15360,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Aye as he rode, to Pandarus he told"
15361,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Both his new sorrow and his joys of old,                       40"
15362,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"So piteously, and with so dead a hue,"
15363,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,That every wight might on his sorrow rue.
15364,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15365,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Forth from the spot he rideth up and down,"
15366,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And everything to his rememberance
15367,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Came as he rode by places of the town                          45
15368,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Where he had felt such perfect pleasure once.
15369,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Lo, yonder saw I mine own Lady dance,"
15370,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And in that Temple she with her bright eyes,"
15371,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"My Lady dear, first bound me captive-wise."
15372,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15373,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And yonder with joy-smitten heart have I                       50
15374,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Heard my own Cresid's laugh; and once at play
15375,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,I yonder saw her eke full blissfully;
15376,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And yonder once she unto me 'gan say--
15377,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Now, my sweet Troilus, love me well, I pray!"
15378,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And there so graciously did me behold,                         55"
15379,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,That hers unto the death my heart I hold.
15380,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15381,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And at the corner of that self-same house
15382,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Heard I my most beloved Lady dear,"
15383,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"So womanly, with voice melodious"
15384,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Singing so well, so goodly, and so clear,                      60"
15385,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,That in my soul methinks I yet do hear
15386,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,The blissful sound; and in that very place
15387,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,My Lady first me took unto her grace.
15388,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15389,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"O blissful God of Love! then thus he cried,"
15390,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"When I the process have in memory,                             65"
15391,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"How thou hast wearied [D] me on every side,"
15392,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Men thence a book might make, a history;"
15393,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"What need to seek a conquest over me,"
15394,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Since I am wholly at thy will? what joy
15395,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Hast thou thy own liege subjects to destroy?                   70
15396,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15397,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Dread Lord! so fearful when provoked, thine ire"
15398,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Well hast thou wreaked on me by pain and grief;
15399,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Now mercy, Lord! thou know'st well I desire"
15400,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Thy grace above all pleasures first and chief;
15401,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And live and die I will in thy belief;                         75
15402,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"For which I ask for guerdon but one boon,"
15403,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,That Cresida again thou send me soon.
15404,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15405,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Constrain her heart as quickly to return,"
15406,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"As thou dost mine with longing her to see,"
15407,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Then know I well that she would not sojourn.                   80
15408,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Now, blissful Lord, so cruel do not be"
15409,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Unto the blood of Troy, I pray of thee,"
15410,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"As Juno was unto the Theban blood,"
15411,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,From whence to Thebes came griefs in multitude.
15412,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15413,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And after this he to the gate did go                           85
15414,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Whence Cresid rode, as if in haste she was;"
15415,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And up and down there went, and to and fro,"
15416,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And to himself full oft he said, alas!"
15417,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"From hence my hope, and solace forth did pass."
15418,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"O would the blissful God now for his joy,                      90"
15419,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,I might her see again coming to Troy!
15420,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15421,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And up to yonder hill was I her guide;
15422,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Alas, and there I took of her my leave;"
15423,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Yonder I saw her to her Father ride,"
15424,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,For very grief of which my heart shall cleave;--95
15425,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And hither home I came when it was eve;
15426,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And here I dwell an outcast from all joy,"
15427,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And shall, unless I see her soon in Troy."
15428,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15429,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And of himself did he imagine oft,"
15430,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"That he was blighted, pale, and waxen less                    100"
15431,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Than he was wont; and that in whispers soft
15432,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Men said, what may it be, can no one guess"
15433,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Why Troilus hath all this heaviness?
15434,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,All which he of himself conceited wholly
15435,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Out of his weakness and his melancholy.                       105
15436,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15437,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Another time he took into his head,"
15438,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"That every wight, who in the way passed by,"
15439,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Had of him ruth, and fancied that they said,"
15440,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,I am right sorry Troilus will die:
15441,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And thus a day or two drove wearily;                          110
15442,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,As ye have heard; such life 'gan he to lead
15443,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,As one that standeth betwixt hope and dread.
15444,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15445,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,For which it pleased him in his songs to show
15446,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"The occasion of his woe, as best he might;"
15447,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And made a fitting song, of words [4] but few,                115"
15448,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Somewhat his woeful heart to make more light;
15449,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And when he was removed from all men's sight,"
15450,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"With a soft night voice, [5] he of his Lady dear,"
15451,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"That absent was, 'gan sing as ye may hear."
15452,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15453,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"O star, of which I lost have all the light,                   120"
15454,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"With a sore heart well ought I to bewail,"
15455,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"That ever dark in torment, night by night,"
15456,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Toward my death with wind I steer and sail; [E]
15457,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,For which upon the tenth night if thou fail
15458,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"With thy bright beams to guide me but one hour,               125"
15459,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,My ship and me Charybdis will devour.
15460,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15461,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"As soon as he this song had thus sung through,"
15462,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,He fell again into his sorrows old;
15463,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And every night, as was his wont to do,"
15464,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Troilus stood the bright moon to behold;                      130
15465,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And all his trouble to the moon he told,"
15466,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And said; I wis, when thou art horn'd anew,"
15467,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,I shall be glad if all the world be true.
15468,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15469,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Thy horns were old as now upon that morrow,"
15470,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"When hence did journey my bright Lady dear,                   135"
15471,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,That cause is of my torment and my sorrow;
15472,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"For which, oh, gentle Luna, bright and clear,"
15473,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"For love of God, run fast above [F] thy sphere;"
15474,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"For when thy horns begin once more to spring,"
15475,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Then shall she come, that with her bliss may bring.           140"
15476,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15477,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"The day is more, and longer every night"
15478,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Than they were wont to be--for he thought so;
15479,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And that the sun did take his course not right,"
15480,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,By longer way than he was wont to go;
15481,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And said, I am in constant dread I trow,                      145"
15482,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"That PhÃ¤eton his son is yet alive,"
15483,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,His too fond father's car amiss to drive.
15484,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15485,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Upon the walls fast also would he walk,"
15486,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,To the end that he the Grecian host might see;
15487,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,And ever thus he to himself would talk:--150
15488,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Lo! yonder is my [6] own bright Lady free;
15489,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Or yonder is it that the tents must be;
15490,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And thence does come this air which is so sweet,"
15491,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,That in my soul I feel the joy of it.
15492,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15493,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"And certainly this wind, that more and more                   155"
15494,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"By moments thus increaseth in my face,"
15495,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Is of my Lady's sighs heavy and sore;
15496,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,I prove it thus; for in no other space
15497,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Of all this town, save only in this place,"
15498,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"Feel I a wind, that soundeth so like pain;                    160"
15499,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"It saith, Alas, why severed are we twain?"
15500,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,
15501,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,"A weary while in pain he tosseth thus,"
15502,TROILUS AND CRESIDA,Till fully past and gone was the ninth night;

17218,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"flowing of the stream, the glittering lively lake, green fields,"
17219,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"without a living creature to be seen on them; behind us, a flat"
17220,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"pasture with forty-two cattle feeding; to our left, the road leading"
17221,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"to the hamlet. No smoke there, the sun shone on the bare roofs. The"
17222,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"people were at work, ploughing, harrowing, and sowing; lasses working;"
17223,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"a dog barking now and then; cocks crowing, birds twittering; the snow"
17224,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"in patches at the top of the highest hills; yellow palms, purple and"
17225,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"green twigs on the birches, ashes with their glittering stems quite"

17227,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"moss of the oaks glossy.... As we went up the vale of Brothers Water,"
17228,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"more and more cattle feeding, a hundred of them. William finished his"
17229,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,poem before we got to the foot of Kirkstone. There were hundreds of
17230,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,cattle in the vale.... The walk up Kirkstone was very interesting. The

17232,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"mossy streamlet which he had before loved, when he saw its bright"

18449,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,In our dejection do we sink as low;                        25
18450,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,To me that morning did it happen so;
18451,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,And fears and fancies thick upon me came;
18452,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Dim sadness--and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could name."
18453,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18454,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,V        I heard the sky-lark warbling [2] in the sky;
18455,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,And I bethought me of the playful hare:                    30
18456,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Even such a happy Child of earth am I;
18457,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Even as these blissful [3] creatures do I fare;
18458,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Far from the world I walk, and from all care;"
18459,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,But there may come another day to me--
18460,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty.            35"
18461,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18462,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"VI       My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought,"
18463,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,As if life's business were a summer mood;
18464,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,As if all needful things would come unsought
18465,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"To genial faith, still rich in genial good; [4]"
18466,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,But how can He expect that others should                   40
18467,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Build for him, sow for him, and at his call"
18468,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all? [A]"
18469,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18470,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"VII      I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy,"
18471,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride; [5]
18472,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Of Him who walked in glory and in joy                      45
18473,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Following his plough, along the mountain-side: [6]"
18474,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,By our own spirits are we deified:
18475,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,We Poets in our youth begin in gladness;
18476,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,But thereof come [7] in the end despondency and madness.
18477,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18478,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"VIII     Now, whether it were [8] by peculiar grace,                50"
18479,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"A leading from above, a something given,"
18480,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Yet it befel, that, in this [9] lonely place,"
18481,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"When I with these untoward thoughts had striven,"
18482,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven [10]
18483,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,I saw [11] a Man before me unawares:                       55
18484,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.
18485,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,[12]
18486,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18487,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,IX       As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie
18488,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Couched on the bald top of an eminence;
18489,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Wonder to all who [13] do the same espy,"
18490,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"By what means it could thither come, and whence;           60"
18491,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,So that it seems a thing endued with sense:
18492,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that [14] on a shelf"
18493,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;"
18494,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18495,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"X        Such seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead,"
18496,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Nor all asleep--in his extreme old age:                    65
18497,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"His body was bent double, feet and head"
18498,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Coming together in life's pilgrimage; [15]
18499,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage"
18500,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Of sickness felt by him in times long past,"
18501,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,A more than human weight upon his frame [16] had cast.     70
18502,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18503,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"XI       Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, [17]"
18504,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood:
18505,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"And, still as I drew near with gentle pace,"
18506,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Upon the margin of that moorish flood [18]
18507,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood,                   75"
18508,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,That heareth not the loud winds when they call;
18509,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"And moveth all together, if it move [19] at all."
18510,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,[20]
18511,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18512,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18513,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"XII      At length, himself unsettling, he the pond"
18514,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look"
18515,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Upon the muddy water, which he conned,                     80"
18516,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,As if he had been reading in a book:
18517,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,And now a stranger's privilege I took; [21]
18518,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"And, drawing to his side, to him did say,"
18519,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"""This morning gives us promise of a glorious day."""
18520,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18521,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"XIII     A gentle answer did the old Man make,                      85"
18522,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew:
18523,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"And him with further words I thus bespake,"
18524,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"""What occupation do you there pursue? [22"
18525,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"This is a lonesome place for one like [23] you."""
18526,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise                   90"
18527,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes. [24] [B]
18528,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18529,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"XIV      His words came feebly, from a feeble chest,"
18530,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"But [25] each in solemn order followed each,"
18531,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,With something of a lofty [26] utterance drest--
18532,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Choice word [27] and measured phrase, above [27] the reach 95"
18533,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Of ordinary men; a stately speech;
18534,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use,"
18535,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Religious men, who give to God and man their dues."
18536,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18537,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"XV       He told, that to these waters he had come [28]"
18538,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"To gather leeches, being old and poor:                    100"
18539,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Employment hazardous and wearisome!
18540,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,And he had many hardships to endure: [29]
18541,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;"
18542,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance;"
18543,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.          105
18544,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18545,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,XVI      The old Man still stood talking by my side;
18546,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,But now [30] his voice to me was like a stream
18547,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide;
18548,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,And the whole body of the Man did seem
18549,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Like one whom I had met with in a dream;                  110
18550,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Or like a man from some far region sent,"
18551,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"To give me human strength, by apt admonishment. [31]"
18552,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18553,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,XVII     My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills;
18554,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,And [32] hope that is unwilling to be fed;
18555,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;             115"
18556,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,And mighty Poets in their misery dead.
18557,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"--Perplexed, and longing to be comforted, [33]"
18558,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"My question eagerly did I renew,"
18559,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"""How is it that you live, and what is it you do?"" [34]"
18560,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18561,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,XVIII    He with a smile did then his words repeat;                120
18562,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"And said, that, gathering leeches, far and wide"
18563,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,He travelled; stirring thus about his feet
18564,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,The waters of the pools where they abide. [35]
18565,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"""Once I could meet with them on every side;"
18566,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,But they have dwindled long by slow decay;                125
18567,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may."" [36]"
18568,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18569,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"XIX      While he was talking thus, the lonely place,"
18570,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"The old Man's shape, and speech--all troubled me:"
18571,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,In my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace
18572,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"About the weary moors continually,                        130"
18573,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,Wandering about alone and silently.
18574,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"While I these thoughts within myself pursued,"
18575,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed."
18576,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,
18577,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"XX       And soon [37] with this he other matter blended,"
18578,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,                  135"
18579,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"But stately in the main; and when he ended, [38]"
18580,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,I could have laughed myself to scorn to find
18581,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,In that decrepit Man so firm a mind.
18582,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"""God,"" said I, ""be my help and stay secure;"
18583,RESOLUTION AND INDEPENDENCE,"I'll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!""     140"

18978,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,extracts from it:
18979,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
18980,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"""It is not a matter of indifference whether you are pleased with his"
18981,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"figure and employment, it may be comparatively whether you are pleased"
18982,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,with _this Poem_; but it is of the utmost importance that you should
18983,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"have had pleasure in contemplating the fortitude, independence,"
18984,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"persevering spirit, and the general moral dignity of this old man's"
18985,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"character."" Again, ""I will explain to you, in prose, my feelings in"
18986,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,writing _that_ poem.... I describe myself as having been exalted to
18987,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,the highest pitch of delight by the joyousness and beauty of nature;
18988,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"and then as depressed, even in the midst of those beautiful objects,"
18989,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,to the lowest dejection and despair. A young poet in the midst of the
18990,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,happiness of nature is described as overwhelmed by the thoughts of the
18991,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"miserable reverses which have befallen the happiest of all men, viz."
18992,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"poets. I think of this till I am so deeply impressed with it, that I"
18993,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,consider the manner in which I was rescued from my dejection and
18994,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,despair almost as an interposition of Providence. A person reading the
18995,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"poem with feelings like mine will have been awed and controlled,"
18996,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,expecting something spiritual or supernatural. What is brought
18997,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"forward? A lonely place, 'a pond, by which an old man _was_, far from"
18998,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"all house or home:' not _stood_, nor _sat_, but _was_--the figure"
18999,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,presented in the most naked simplicity possible. This feeling of
19000,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,spirituality or supernaturalness is again referred to as being strong
19001,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"in my mind in this passage. How came he here? thought I, or what can"
19002,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"he be doing? I then describe him, whether ill or well is not for me to"
19003,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"judge with perfect confidence; but this I _can_ confidently affirm,"
19004,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"that though I believe God has given me a strong imagination, I cannot"
19005,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"conceive a figure more impressive than that of an old man like this,"
19006,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"the survivor of a wife and ten children, travelling alone among the"
19007,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"mountains and all lonely places, carrying with him his own fortitude"
19008,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,and the necessities which an unjust state of society has laid upon
19009,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,him. You speak of his speech as tedious. Every thing is tedious when
19010,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,one does not read with the feelings of the author. 'The Thorn' is
19011,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,tedious to hundreds; and so is 'The Idiot Boy' to hundreds. It is in
19012,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"the character of the old man to tell his story, which an impatient"

19448,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,we crossed _Westminster Bridge_; the houses not overhung by their

21850,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,Wordsworth gave as the date of the composition of this poem the year
21851,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"1805; but he said of the following one, 'To a Young Lady, who had been"
21852,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Reproached for taking Long Walks in the Country'--""composed at the same"
21853,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"time"" and ""designed to make one piece""--that it was written in 1803."
21854,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
21855,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,But it is certain that these following lines appeared in 'The Morning
21856,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Post', on Feb. 12, 1802, where they are headed 'To a beautiful Young"
21857,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Lady, who had been harshly spoken of on account of her fondness for"
21858,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"taking long walks in the Country'. There is difficulty, both in"
21859,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"ascertaining the exact date of composition, and in knowing who ""Louisa"""
21860,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"or the ""Young Lady"" was. Mrs. Millicent G. Fawcett wrote to me several"
21861,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"years ago, suggesting, with some plausibility, a much earlier date, if"
21862,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,Dorothy Wordsworth was the lady referred to. She referred me to
21863,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Dorothy's letter to her aunt, Mrs. Crackenthorpe, written from"
21864,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Windybrow, Keswick, in 1794, when staying there with her brother; and"
21865,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,says
21866,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
21867,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"""What inclined me to think that the poem was written earlier than 1805"
21868,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"was that it anticipates Dorothy's marriage, and this would more"
21869,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,naturally be present as a probable event in W. W.'s mind in 1794 or
21870,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"thereabouts than in 1805, after Dorothy had dedicated her life to her"
21871,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"brother, to the exclusion of all wish to make a home of her own by"
21872,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,marriage. The expression 'Healthy as a shepherd boy' is also more
21873,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,applicable to a girl of twenty-two than to a woman of thirty-three. Do
21874,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"you think it possible that the poem may have been written in 1794, and"
21875,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"not published till later, when its application would be less evident"
21876,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"to the family circle?"""
21877,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
21878,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Dorothy Wordsworth's letter will be quoted in full in a later volume,"
21879,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,but the following extract from it may be given now:
21880,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
21881,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"""I cannot pass unnoticed that part of your letter in which you speak"
21882,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,of my 'rambling about the country on foot.' So far from considering
21883,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,this as a matter for condemnation I rather thought it would have given
21884,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,my friends pleasure that I had courage to make use of the strength
21885,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"with which Nature has endowed me, when it not only procured me"
21886,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,infinitely more pleasure than I should have received from sitting in a
21887,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"post-chaise, but was also the means of saving me at least thirty"
21888,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"shillings."""
21889,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
21890,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,I do not think the date of composition can be so early as 1794. What may
21891,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"be called internal, or structural, evidence is against it. Wordsworth"
21892,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,never could have written these two poems till after his settlement at
21893,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Dove Cottage. Besides, in 1794, he could have no knowledge of a possible"
21894,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"""nest in a green dale, a harbour and a hold""; while at that time his"
21895,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"sister had certainly no ""cottage home."" I believe they were written"
21896,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,after he took up his residence at Town-end (the date being uncertain);
21897,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"and that they refer to his sister, and not to his wife. It has been"
21898,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"suggested by Mr. Ernest Coleridge (see 'The AthenÃ¦um', Oct. 21, 1893)"
21899,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,that they refer to Mary Hutchinson: but there is no evidence of
21900,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Wordsworth taking long country walks with her before their marriage, or"
21901,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"that she was ""nymph-like,"" ""fleet and strong,"" that she loved to ""roam"
21902,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"the moorland,"" ""in weather rough and bleak,"" or that she ""hunted"
21903,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"waterfalls."" The reference to his sister is confirmed by the omission of"
21904,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,the delightful second stanza of the poem in the last edition revised by
21905,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"the poet, that of 1849, when she was a confirmed invalid at Rydal Mount."
21906,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Those ""smiles to earth unknown,"" had then ceased for ever. The reason"
21907,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"why Wordsworth erased so delightful and wonderful a stanza, is to me"
21908,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"only explicable on the supposition, that it was his sister he referred"
21909,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"to, she who had accompanied him in former days, in so many of his ""long"
21910,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"walks in the country."" His wife never did this; she had not the physical"
21911,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"strength to do it; and, if she had been the person referred to,"
21912,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Wordsworth would hardly, in 1845, have erased such a description of her,"
21913,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"as occurs in the stanza written in 1802, when she was still so vigorous."
21914,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Besides, Mary Wordsworth was in no sense ""a Child of Nature,"" as Dorothy"
21915,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"was: while the testimony of the Wordsworth household is explicit, that"
21916,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"it was to his sister, and not to his wife, that the poet referred. I"
21917,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,find no difficulty in the allusion made in the second poem to Dorothy
21918,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"being yet possibly a ""Wife and Friend""; nor to the fact that it was"
21919,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"originally addressed ""To a beautiful Young Lady."" Neither Dorothy nor"
21920,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Mary Wordsworth were physically ""beautiful,"" according to our highest"
21921,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"standards; although the poet addressed the latter as ""a Phantom of"
21922,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"delight,"" and as ""a lovely apparition."" It is quite true that it was"
21923,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Mary Wordsworth's old age that was ""serene and bright,"" while Dorothy's"
21924,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,was the very reverse; but the poet's anticipation of the future was
21925,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"written when his sister was young, and was by far the stronger of the"

22271,YEW-TREES,"Robinson of Whinfell Hall, Cockermouth, wrote to me of it in May 1880:"
22272,YEW-TREES,
22273,YEW-TREES,"""The tree in outline expanded towards the root considerably: then, at"
22274,YEW-TREES,"about two feet from the ground, the trunk began to separate into huge"
22275,YEW-TREES,"limbs, spreading in all directions. I once measured this trunk at its"
22276,YEW-TREES,"least circumference, and found it 23 feet 10 inches. For the last 50"
22277,YEW-TREES,"or 60 years the branches have been gradually dying on the S. E. side,"
22278,YEW-TREES,"and about 25 years ago a strong S. E. gale, coming with accumulated"
22279,YEW-TREES,"force down Hope Gill, and--owing to the tree being so open on that"
22280,YEW-TREES,"side--taking it laterally at a disadvantage, wrenched off one of the"
22281,YEW-TREES,"great side branches down to the ground, carrying away nearly a third"
22282,YEW-TREES,"of the tree. This event led to farther peril; for, the second portion"
22283,YEW-TREES,"having been sold to a cabinetmaker at Whitehaven for Â£15, this gave"
22284,YEW-TREES,the impression that the wood was very valuable (owing to the celebrity
22285,YEW-TREES,of the tree); and a local woodmonger bought the remainder. Two men
22286,YEW-TREES,"worked half a day to grub it up; but a Cockermouth medical gentleman,"
22287,YEW-TREES,"hearing what was going on, made representations to the owner, and it"
22288,YEW-TREES,"ended in the woodmen sparing the remainder of the tree, which was not"
22289,YEW-TREES,much the worse for what had been done. Many large dead branches have
22290,YEW-TREES,"also been cut off, and now we have to regret that the 'pride of Lorton"
22291,YEW-TREES,"Vale,' shorn of its ancient dignity, is but a ruin, much more"
22292,YEW-TREES,"venerable than picturesque."""
22293,YEW-TREES,
22294,YEW-TREES,"The ""fraternal Four of Borrowdale"" are certainly ""worthier still of"
22295,YEW-TREES,"note."" The ""trunk"" described in the Fenwick note, as on the road between"
22296,YEW-TREES,"Rosthwaite and Stonethwaite, has disappeared long ago; but the ""solemn"
22297,YEW-TREES,"and capacious grove"" existed till 1883 in its integrity. The description"
22298,YEW-TREES,"in the poem is realistic throughout, while the visible scene suggests"
22299,YEW-TREES,
22300,YEW-TREES,"""an ideal grove, in which the ghostly masters of mankind meet, and"
22301,YEW-TREES,"sleep, and offer worship to the Destiny that abides above them, while"

23882,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,There can be no doubt that this is the sentence referred to both by

23894,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"to be copied, though reluctant to publish it;--that there was"
23895,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,sufficient intimacy between him and the Wordsworths to account for his
23896,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"showing or lending the manuscript to them, especially as they had"

24754,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"If not, make merry in despite"

24765,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Hath long been of thy family.
24766,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"With legs that move not, if they can,"
24767,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"And useless arms, a trunk of man,"
24768,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"He sits, and with a vacant eye;"
24769,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,A sight to make a stranger sigh!                             20
24770,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"Deaf, drooping, that is now his doom:"
24771,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,His world is in this single room:
24772,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Is this a place for mirthful cheer? [3]
24773,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Can merry-making enter here? [A]
24774,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,

24776,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Of him in that forlorn estate!
24777,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,He breathes a subterraneous damp;
24778,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,But bright as Vesper shines her lamp:
24779,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,He is as mute as Jedborough Tower:
24780,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"She jocund as it was of yore,                                30"
24781,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,With all its bravery on; in times
24782,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"When all alive with merry chimes,"
24783,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"Upon a sun-bright morn of May,"
24784,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,It roused the Vale to holiday.
24785,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,
24786,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"I praise thee, Matron! and thy due                         35"
24787,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"Is praise, heroic praise, and true!"
24788,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,With admiration I behold
24789,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Thy gladness unsubdued and bold:
24790,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"Thy looks, thy gestures, all present"
24791,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,The picture of a life well spent:                            40
24792,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,This do I see; and something more;
24793,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,A strength unthought of heretofore!
24794,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Delighted am I for thy sake;
24795,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,And yet a higher joy partake:
24796,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Our Human-nature throws away                                 45
24797,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"Its second twilight, and looks gay;"
24798,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,A land of promise and of pride
24799,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"Unfolding, wide as life is wide."
24800,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,
24801,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Ah! see her helpless Charge! enclosed
24802,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"Within himself as seems, composed;                           50"
24803,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"To fear of loss, and hope of gain,"
24804,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"The strife of happiness and pain,"
24805,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Utterly dead! yet in the guise
24806,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"Of little infants, when their eyes"
24807,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Begin to follow to and fro                                   55
24808,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"The persons that before them go,"
24809,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"He tracks her motions, quick or slow."
24810,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Her buoyant spirit can prevail
24811,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Where common cheerfulness would fail;
24812,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,She strikes upon him with the heat                           60
24813,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Of July suns; he feels it sweet;
24814,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,An animal delight though dim!
24815,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,'Tis all that now remains for him!
24816,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,
24817,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"The more I looked, I wondered more--"
24818,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"And, while I scanned them o'er and o'er, [4]                 65"
24819,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Some inward trouble suddenly
24820,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Broke from the Matron's strong black eye--[5]
24821,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"A remnant of uneasy light,"
24822,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,A flash of something over-bright![B]
24823,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Nor long this mystery did detain                             70
24824,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,My thoughts;--she told in pensive strain [6]
24825,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,"That she had borne a heavy yoke,"
24826,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Been stricken by a twofold stroke;
24827,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Ill health of body; and had pined
24828,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,Beneath worse ailments of the mind.                          75
24829,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,
24830,THE MATRON OF JEDBOROUGH AND HER HUSBAND,So be it!--but let praise ascend

24927,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"""We were received with hearty welcome by a good woman, who, though"
24928,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"above seventy years old, moved about as briskly as if she was only"
24929,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,seventeen. Those parts of the house which we were to occupy were neat
24930,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"and clean; she showed me every corner, and, before I had been ten"
24931,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"minutes in the house, opened her very drawers that I might see what a"
24932,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"stock of linen she had; then asked how long we should stay, and said"
24933,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,she wished we were come for three months. She was a most remarkable
24934,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,person; the alacrity with which she ran up-stairs when we rung the
24935,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"bell, and guessed at, and strove to prevent, our wants was surprising;"
24936,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"she had a quick eye, and keen strong features, and a joyousness in her"
24937,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"motions, like what used to be in old Molly when she was particularly"
24938,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,elated. I found afterwards that she had been subject to fits of
24939,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,dejection and ill-health: we then conjectured that her overflowing
24940,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,gaiety and strength might in part be attributed to the same cause as
24941,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"her former dejection. Her husband was deaf and infirm, and sate in a"
24942,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,chair with scarcely the power to move a limb--an affecting contrast!
24943,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,The old woman said they had been a very hard-working pair; they had
24944,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,wrought like slaves at their trade--her husband had been a currier;
24945,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"and she told me how they had portioned off their daughters with money,"
24946,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"and each a feather bed, and that in their old age they had laid out"
24947,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"the little they could spare in building and furnishing that house, and"
24948,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,she added with pride that she had lived in her youth in the family of
24949,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Lady Egerton, who was no high lady, and now was in the habit of coming"
24950,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"to her house whenever she was at Jedburgh, and a hundred other things;"
24951,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"for when she once began with Lady Egerton, she did not know how to"
24952,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"stop, nor did I wish it, for she was very entertaining. Mr. Scott sat"
24953,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"with us an hour or two, and repeated a part of the 'Lay of the Last"
24954,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,Minstrel'. When he was gone our hostess came to see if we wanted
24955,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"anything, and to wish us good-night. On all occasions her manners were"
24956,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,governed by the same spirit: there was no withdrawing one's attention
24957,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"from her. We were so much interested that William, long afterwards,"
24958,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,thought it worth while to express in verse the sensations which she
24959,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"had excited, and which then remained as vividly in his mind as at the"
24960,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"moment when we lost sight of Jedburgh."""
