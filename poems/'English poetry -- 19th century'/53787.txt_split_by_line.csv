315,EARLIER POEMS],"Still gather thee Time’s grain in growing heap,"
316,EARLIER POEMS],From golden age to golden age to be;

320,EARLIER POEMS],
321,EARLIER POEMS],"Arise, sweet soul! Arise, and take thy throne,"

323,EARLIER POEMS],The human spirit’s still aspiring stair
324,EARLIER POEMS],"Whose marble feet were laid in toil and care,"
325,EARLIER POEMS],"And washed with tears, and worn in eager quest"
326,EARLIER POEMS],"Of false and fleeting phantoms, seeking rest."
327,EARLIER POEMS],But now thy feet are fledged and would aspire
328,EARLIER POEMS],"To climb the summit of thy hope’s desire,"

382,EARLIER POEMS],ABOUT the time when garlanded green May
383,EARLIER POEMS],"At Summer’s threshold casts her blossom crown,"
384,EARLIER POEMS],"Time bore me on his wingèd wheels away,"
385,EARLIER POEMS],"Out of the joyless city where I lay,"
386,EARLIER POEMS],From smoke-dimmed streets whose dusky skies disown
387,EARLIER POEMS],"The day-god’s glorious face, serene that shows"
388,EARLIER POEMS],"This day of days, to reign in his fair house,"
389,EARLIER POEMS],"Cloud-built, and white, and interspaced with blue,"
390,EARLIER POEMS],"Above the green earth’s fields that I did pass,"
391,EARLIER POEMS],Bearing ungathered harvests in their grass
392,EARLIER POEMS],"Of star-bright flowers, and every magic hue"
393,EARLIER POEMS],"Born of the hours, and of the kindling zone"
394,EARLIER POEMS],"Sun-cast o’er wandering mead and upland lone,"
395,EARLIER POEMS],"That now on every hand mine eyes did fill,"
396,EARLIER POEMS],As went the wheel whirl’d with the fiery will.
397,EARLIER POEMS],
398,EARLIER POEMS],"And always, as the changeful landscape spread"
399,EARLIER POEMS],"Mead beyond mead, and furrow’d ridge and tree,"
400,EARLIER POEMS],"And traversed road, and bridge, and woodland lea;"
401,EARLIER POEMS],"Me seemèd as a chart my life to see,"
402,EARLIER POEMS],"What was, and is, and that which is to be,"
403,EARLIER POEMS],As dark and bright the region’s face I read.
404,EARLIER POEMS],"Nor yet I stay’d at all, but still with Time"
405,EARLIER POEMS],"Fled by, and onward many leagues, until,"
406,EARLIER POEMS],"About the height of day the wheel was still,"
407,EARLIER POEMS],"About the hour it was ere noon should chime,"
408,EARLIER POEMS],"And I look’d forth and saw dim-pointed spires,"
409,EARLIER POEMS],"Like flames, arising from a golden mead"
410,EARLIER POEMS],Which burn’d with all the yellow crowded fires
411,EARLIER POEMS],Of shining cups that fill the fields of May:
412,EARLIER POEMS],"Whereby a city fair mine eyes had heed,"
413,EARLIER POEMS],"Verged round with bowery close, and willows grey"
414,EARLIER POEMS],"Shading the silent water’s secret way,"
415,EARLIER POEMS],Girdling the quiet town with cluster’d reed.
416,EARLIER POEMS],
417,EARLIER POEMS],"Thence rose no surge of men, or sound of strife,"
418,EARLIER POEMS],"But smoothly glode the even hours of life,"
419,EARLIER POEMS],Told by the sweet-tongued bells in tuneful towers;
420,EARLIER POEMS],"And in the streets there moved the breath of flowers,"
421,EARLIER POEMS],"And incense, such as riseth after showers"
422,EARLIER POEMS],"Upon deep gardens, hiding in their bowers"
423,EARLIER POEMS],The inmost heart of sweetness.
424,EARLIER POEMS],Still my way
425,EARLIER POEMS],"Drew on, between high-window’d walls and old,"
426,EARLIER POEMS],"That to the street an ancient story told,"
427,EARLIER POEMS],"With solemn mien unto Life’s changing day,"
428,EARLIER POEMS],"In restless ebb and flow, as sea-waves play"
429,EARLIER POEMS],About the feet of lonely cliff’s; tho’ now
430,EARLIER POEMS],"Even these I pass’d, as fleeting things and vain,"
431,EARLIER POEMS],For all my heart a strange consuming pain
432,EARLIER POEMS],"Possess’d, in thought of what I hoped to gain"
433,EARLIER POEMS],"Fill’d with an exquisite fire, wherein did show"
434,EARLIER POEMS],"All things as dross, or gold of fairest vein:"
435,EARLIER POEMS],"As, since the gate of Love had oped for me,"
436,EARLIER POEMS],I lived in hell or heavenly ecstasy.
437,EARLIER POEMS],
438,EARLIER POEMS],"But all things on this day had good import,"
439,EARLIER POEMS],"For even now I went to Love’s high court,"
440,EARLIER POEMS],"To greet my heart’s dear queen, where she did dwell"
441,EARLIER POEMS],"In this his holy city, where the streets"
442,EARLIER POEMS],"Seem’d gold, or like the burnish’d path which meets"
443,EARLIER POEMS],The sun’s bright porch across the shining sea;
444,EARLIER POEMS],So in Love’s glory shone my way to me.
445,EARLIER POEMS],Until before her gate the splendour fell.
446,EARLIER POEMS],
447,EARLIER POEMS],"Robed in sweet grace and crowned with her hair,"
448,EARLIER POEMS],"I met my queen, upon her palace stair,"
449,EARLIER POEMS],"And near I was to fall and worship there,"
450,EARLIER POEMS],"As to her hand I brought a golden gift,"
451,EARLIER POEMS],"Which she, my gracious sovereign, counted well,"
452,EARLIER POEMS],"And me unto her highest grace did lift,"
453,EARLIER POEMS],Making me rich above all kingly state.
454,EARLIER POEMS],
455,EARLIER POEMS],"For side by side within her house we sate,"
456,EARLIER POEMS],"Or ’neath the azure canopy of heaven,"
457,EARLIER POEMS],"And every hour and every day, of seven,"
458,EARLIER POEMS],Brought unto our feet their separate joy.
459,EARLIER POEMS],And every day the plenteous feast was spread
460,EARLIER POEMS],"Before my grateful heart, and eyes, and lips"
461,EARLIER POEMS],"That drank the wine of Love and broke his bread,"
462,EARLIER POEMS],And drew my soul delight thro’ honey sips
463,EARLIER POEMS],From the sweet source of sweet which may not cloy.
464,EARLIER POEMS],
465,EARLIER POEMS],"Then from Love’s banquet, rising, my beloved"
466,EARLIER POEMS],"Forth led me in the bond of her dear hand,"
467,EARLIER POEMS],That we in his glad courts might understand
468,EARLIER POEMS],Fresh joyance; and thro’ all his realm we moved.
469,EARLIER POEMS],"Adown the golden street my lady led,"
470,EARLIER POEMS],"Where pass’d us, to and fro, Love’s votaries—"
471,EARLIER POEMS],"The searchers of his book, within whose eyes"
472,EARLIER POEMS],"Was writ his name, whose chanting lips had said"
473,EARLIER POEMS],"His prayers and orisons within the shrines,"
474,EARLIER POEMS],"Dim-window’d, strange, and still with sacred air,"
475,EARLIER POEMS],"Stirr’d by the wings of singing spirits fair,"
476,EARLIER POEMS],"When the sweet anthem lifteth or declines,"
477,EARLIER POEMS],In organ waves that sweep along the lines
478,EARLIER POEMS],"Of the soul’s shore, to break upon and die,"
479,EARLIER POEMS],"Soft on the soothed borders, silently."
480,EARLIER POEMS],
481,EARLIER POEMS],"We passéd by the door and enter’d in,"
482,EARLIER POEMS],For in Love’s holy place we sought to win
483,EARLIER POEMS],High ecstasy whereon our souls might climb
484,EARLIER POEMS],"Even to the utmost gate of golden bliss,"
485,EARLIER POEMS],"And know within the sanctuary of this,"
486,EARLIER POEMS],Our dear inheritance in God’s good time.
487,EARLIER POEMS],
488,EARLIER POEMS],"Love’s service done, forth streamed from their place"
489,EARLIER POEMS],"His choristers and singing boys, attired"
490,EARLIER POEMS],"In white raiment, shining where they quired;"
491,EARLIER POEMS],"And after them we went with silent pace,"
492,EARLIER POEMS],"And towards the groves of pleasure turn’d our face,"
493,EARLIER POEMS],"Whence by green quietude of cloister’d stone,"
494,EARLIER POEMS],"And shadow’d courts that kept themselves alone,"
495,EARLIER POEMS],And ’neath the carven boughs that interlace;
496,EARLIER POEMS],Until we came beneath the fairer roof
497,EARLIER POEMS],"Of curtain’d leaves, light spread, of greenest woof,"
498,EARLIER POEMS],"Glowing between the stoney window fret,"
499,EARLIER POEMS],"As shines such light of paradise men get,"
500,EARLIER POEMS],Dark-barr’d by care which holdeth them aloof
501,EARLIER POEMS],And binds their souls within life’s twisted net.
502,EARLIER POEMS],
503,EARLIER POEMS],"But enter’d we the joyful Eden gate,"
504,EARLIER POEMS],"Where talk the trees of summer, and of green"
505,EARLIER POEMS],More glorious than May’s bright head doth screen
506,EARLIER POEMS],"Whereas she hideth from the flaming state,"
507,EARLIER POEMS],"When the all regal sun would penetrate,"
508,EARLIER POEMS],"Seeking dominion in the realm of shade,"
509,EARLIER POEMS],"Where now we thought to find sweet pleasure laid,"
510,EARLIER POEMS],"And take her sleeping, while the hours should wait."
511,EARLIER POEMS],
512,EARLIER POEMS],Yea! hidden in the odorous aisles of May;
513,EARLIER POEMS],"Whose fragrance fans the air which faints away,"
514,EARLIER POEMS],"There, in a labyrinth of leaves I caught her—"
515,EARLIER POEMS],Whereby soft willows kiss the silent water—
516,EARLIER POEMS],"I caught her, and I kiss’d, tho’ she did pray"
517,EARLIER POEMS],"Release, and said: “Thou canst not hold Time’s daughter.”"
518,EARLIER POEMS],"But her I held, nor let her thence depart"
519,EARLIER POEMS],Till I had won her favourable grace;
520,EARLIER POEMS],And after oft we saw her fleeting face
521,EARLIER POEMS],"Laugh through the leaves, and in our kindled heart"
522,EARLIER POEMS],"Were glad exceedingly, nor thought to part,"
523,EARLIER POEMS],Content a little while in each fair place
524,EARLIER POEMS],To know a sweet above all flowery space.
525,EARLIER POEMS],
526,EARLIER POEMS],My faint tongue faltereth when I would tell
527,EARLIER POEMS],"What doors of joy we pass’d, what sights to seek,"
528,EARLIER POEMS],"But Love’s day endeth, and his holy week,"
529,EARLIER POEMS],Whose dear appointed feasts we kept full well;
530,EARLIER POEMS],"Seeking Love’s face at morn and eventide,"
531,EARLIER POEMS],"Tho’ oft it was too bright to look upon,"
532,EARLIER POEMS],"Shining above the splendour of the sun,"
533,EARLIER POEMS],A burning flame when day’s dim fire had died.
534,EARLIER POEMS],"And now, the last of days, it came to pass"
535,EARLIER POEMS],"I with my Love, upon a space of grass,"
536,EARLIER POEMS],Sate by a water which the willows kept
537,EARLIER POEMS],"And silently the stream beneath them swept,"
538,EARLIER POEMS],"Secret as time, and still, and staying not;"
539,EARLIER POEMS],"Fair fell the sun thro’ glancing leaves above,"
540,EARLIER POEMS],"And fair on us did shine the sun of Love,"
541,EARLIER POEMS],As one brief hour together we forgot
542,EARLIER POEMS],All earthly things in that enchanted plot—
543,EARLIER POEMS],"The world of strife, and evil-favour’d care,"
544,EARLIER POEMS],And misery whose voice was silent there:
545,EARLIER POEMS],"Even so, a little while, our blissful lot."
546,EARLIER POEMS],
547,EARLIER POEMS],"A little while—but soon the end befel,"
548,EARLIER POEMS],"For Time, a sudden shadow, on us fell,"
549,EARLIER POEMS],And loud above I heard his hateful bell
550,EARLIER POEMS],Clang in the tower to ring our sweet day’s knell.
551,EARLIER POEMS],
552,EARLIER POEMS],"Thence was I torn from my dear Love away,"
553,EARLIER POEMS],"And, as a dream, I lost upon that day"
554,EARLIER POEMS],"My hold of joy, and slipp’d adown, adown."
555,EARLIER POEMS],Nor knew I more until I woke again
556,EARLIER POEMS],Unto the endless world with all its pain—
557,EARLIER POEMS],"The sea-wide city, and the sad refrain"
558,EARLIER POEMS],Of hungry waves that now my song would drown.

628,EARLIER POEMS],Her sister to my table bare
629,EARLIER POEMS],"Sweet pleasure of earth’s fruits and rare,"
630,EARLIER POEMS],As every season brought its meed
631,EARLIER POEMS],Or ever as my soul had need.

643,EARLIER POEMS],"She touched the strings, she ruled the lute,"
644,EARLIER POEMS],And many a soft harmonious flute
645,EARLIER POEMS],That mocked the birds in leafy quire;
646,EARLIER POEMS],But oft this spirit would aspire
647,EARLIER POEMS],"To lift the solemn organ’s voice,"
648,EARLIER POEMS],"And this would be her dearest choice,"
649,EARLIER POEMS],"Till, with its deeper soul embued,"

677,EARLIER POEMS],“Go forth and tell the world I come.”
678,EARLIER POEMS],
679,EARLIER POEMS],Beneath the windows of the dawn
680,EARLIER POEMS],"I took my way, by lake and lawn,"

683,EARLIER POEMS],
684,EARLIER POEMS],And from the dale and from the down
685,EARLIER POEMS],"I passed into the sleeping town,"
686,EARLIER POEMS],Along the stoney streets to spill
687,EARLIER POEMS],"My flowers, by door and window sill:"
688,EARLIER POEMS],
689,EARLIER POEMS],"But they were like the eyes of men,"
690,EARLIER POEMS],"Sleep-locked, though some were open then:"

694,EARLIER POEMS],"He saw my flowers, and then he sighed,"
695,EARLIER POEMS],And turned upon his bed and died.
696,EARLIER POEMS],"I took my way with soundless feet,"
697,EARLIER POEMS],But none I met my steps to greet.
698,EARLIER POEMS],
699,EARLIER POEMS],"Save when a wakeful babe me spied,"
700,EARLIER POEMS],And stretched his dimpled arms and cried.
701,EARLIER POEMS],"They hushed his voice, nor knew his will—"
702,EARLIER POEMS],I left the city sleeping still.

704,EARLIER POEMS],*       *       *       *       *

785,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),I heard a shout—I heard a cry.
786,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),"A horn’s far sound the woods awoke,"
787,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),"And sudden from the thicket broke,"
788,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),"In my soul’s sight, a thing of flame,"

793,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),And from that end would him restrain;
794,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),"While did the stirring horn resound,"
795,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),And in the leash each panting hound
796,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),Pressed hard to slip the tightened chain.
797,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),
798,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),What would that eager hunter gain?
799,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),Some magic thing whose form and hue

812,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),Till far beyond the open green
813,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),"They flashed the forest stems between,"
814,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),And soon were lost in night of wood.
815,(SONG OF THE HOURS.),Again I heard Time’s interlude:—

827,TIME,What is Truth? Man’s long endeavour

837,TIME,My soul knew rest no more that day.
838,TIME,"I heard Time’s voice sink far away,"
839,TIME,"And long did muse till light was gone,"
840,TIME,Still sitting in my porch alone.
841,TIME,
842,TIME,"Strange thoughts like flashes went and came,"
843,TIME,"And dreams of love, and hopes of fame,"
844,TIME,With dim desires that inly burned;
845,TIME,Dead hopes that rose again and yearned
846,TIME,"To follow still that unknown quest,"
847,TIME,"And failing, fluttered back to rest."
848,TIME,
849,TIME,"Then had my soul a vision strange,"
850,TIME,"As far in spirit did I range,"
851,TIME,"And I beheld a far dim plain,"
852,TIME,"Dyed in day’s last Tyrean stain,"
853,TIME,And through its dark and desert ground
854,TIME,"A gleaming vein of water wound,"
855,TIME,Where lonely piles of ruin old
856,TIME,"Loomed vast, with hollow chambers cold,"
857,TIME,"Where horror dwelt with night and death,"
858,TIME,And filled they were with ghostly breath.
859,TIME,
860,TIME,"But there amid the gathering glooms,"
861,TIME,"Among the temples and the tombs,"
862,TIME,"One wandered in a pilgrim’s guise,"
863,TIME,Who fixed afar his wistful eyes;
864,TIME,"His footsteps kept the river’s side,"
865,TIME,"A glowing lamp his feet did guide,"
866,TIME,"That shone upon that desert’s dearth,"
867,TIME,As like a star there fall’n to earth;
868,TIME,"And moving through the twilight dim,"
869,TIME,"By shattered arch and column slim,"
870,TIME,"With staff and scrip he kept his way,"
871,TIME,Among those wrecks of ancient day.
872,TIME,
873,TIME,*       *       *       *       *
874,TIME,
875,TIME,"Far, far upon that desert land,"
876,TIME,"Half buried in her grave of sand,"
877,TIME,The ancient head of Egypt rose;
878,TIME,"And, still sublime in death’s repose,"
879,TIME,Great Memnon kept his awful throne
880,TIME,Outwatching day and night alone:
881,TIME,And where the Greek laid stone on stone
882,TIME,"The faces of his gods were shown,"
883,TIME,When to the world—a youth—there came
884,TIME,"Fair Wisdom, Power, and Beauty’s dame,"
885,TIME,"Heré, not Pallas, had his choice"
886,TIME,But Aphrodité won his voice.
887,TIME,"The crumbling strength of mighty Rome,"
888,TIME,"Her grave, her cradle, and her home;"
889,TIME,There stood the emblems of her reign—
890,TIME,"The Arch that would the world sustain,"
891,TIME,And still doth span in legioned range
892,TIME,"The gulf of time, the waves of change."
893,TIME,
894,TIME,"Long stood the Pilgrim here at gaze,"
895,TIME,"As lost in thought of antique days,"
896,TIME,As far his searching eyes could scan
897,TIME,Beneath the age-worn arches’ span.
898,TIME,He marked each age’s builded pile
899,TIME,"Loom dimly down the endless aisle,"
900,TIME,"Where shone the winding waters’ thread,"
901,TIME,"A wandering life among the dead,"
902,TIME,Until his sight no more could trace
903,TIME,"Its courses from their hidden place,"
904,TIME,Wrapt in the clinging mists that shroud
905,TIME,The trackless mountains dim with cloud;
906,TIME,But still his spirit found no home
907,TIME,Beneath the broad eternal dome.
908,TIME,
909,TIME,"At last the Pilgrim turned and sighed,"
910,TIME,Nor stayed he where a cross beside
911,TIME,Marked how a greater power and pride
912,TIME,"Did conquer Rome, and still doth bide."
913,TIME,Full many a stone about that ground
914,TIME,"Made stumbling, but of flowers were found"
915,TIME,None save the sanguined poppy’s hue
916,TIME,Between still sleep and death that grew.
917,TIME,
918,TIME,"The Pilgrim stayed for sleep nor rest,"
919,TIME,As bent upon some hidden quest;
920,TIME,Nor turned he from his painful way
921,TIME,Where folk made feast and holiday
922,TIME,"Beneath fair vines and fruited trees,"
923,TIME,"As pipe, and dance, and song them please."
924,TIME,"He seemed the world of men to shun,"
925,TIME,"And joyed when he a wood had won,"
926,TIME,"Sweet cloistered green, and roofed above,"
927,TIME,"Where soft he heard the wooing dove,"
928,TIME,And sound of wandering water near;
929,TIME,"He drank its crystal cup and clear,"
930,TIME,And kept his path beside the stream
931,TIME,Till he beheld white pillars gleam.
932,TIME,
933,TIME,He passed from green to blossomed boughs
934,TIME,That compassed fair a secret house;
935,TIME,"Still music drew him to the door,"
936,TIME,"Swift beat his heart, and trembling more,"
937,TIME,"He entered, to a gold dim space"
938,TIME,"Flame-lit before an altar daïs,"
939,TIME,"Rose-garlanded, most fair and meet,"
940,TIME,"And all the air was still and sweet,"
941,TIME,But over these in fairer case
942,TIME,Shone the clear semblance of a face.
943,TIME,
944,TIME,"He knelt before that altar stone,"
945,TIME,"The anthem soothed his heart’s faint tone,"
946,TIME,"And seraph voices high and soft,"
947,TIME,"In measured cadence quired aloft,"
948,TIME,Or sailed in tempest gusts of sound
949,TIME,When passion’s music shook the ground.
950,TIME,"Filled was the Pilgrim’s soul and bowed,"
951,TIME,Till in his stress he cried aloud:
952,TIME,"“O Love! This is thy holy place,"
953,TIME,"Give me, I pray, my lady’s grace!”"

962,TIME,
963,TIME,"WHEN summer reigned in leafy sheen,"
964,TIME,"I found me in a garden green,"
965,TIME,"Deep hidden from the sun’s gold edge,"
966,TIME,"Beneath a rose-hung thorny hedge,"
967,TIME,"Upon a space of cool fair grass,"
968,TIME,Whereon not yet the scythe should pass;
969,TIME,"Though in the meadows was it laid,"
970,TIME,Where Time was stooping in the shade
971,TIME,"As, foot by foot, with measured sweep"
972,TIME,His engine cleft the grassy deep;
973,TIME,And thence fresh fragrance wafted sweet
974,TIME,"The smell of roses blown to meet,"
975,TIME,Mixed in the drowsèd air and stole
976,TIME,In slumber to my dreamful soul.
977,TIME,
978,TIME,"Full long I lay in leafy lair,"
979,TIME,"Until, upon the murmurous air,"
980,TIME,One murmur grew with deep’ning note
981,TIME,"And soon my sleeping ear it smote,"
982,TIME,And woke a trouble in my breast—
983,TIME,A joyful pain more sweet than rest.
984,TIME,Like as the voice of plaining strings
985,TIME,When magic hands the music brings
986,TIME,Out of the viols’ soul in sound
987,TIME,"That hath a power when speech is bound,"
988,TIME,To lift the whirlwind and the wail
989,TIME,"Of passion’s tempest, and the veil"
990,TIME,"Of dumb desires and hopes that cry,"
991,TIME,"Until the strong winds sinking die,"
992,TIME,"Though still the wrought waves strike the shore,"
993,TIME,Above them shrill a voice dost soar;
994,TIME,"Or with the soft gale, falling low,"
995,TIME,"To lull the soul, sings sweet and slow,"
996,TIME,And folds the fluttering wings of peace:
997,TIME,So thrilled that music through the trees;
998,TIME,"The leaves were stirred upon the boughs,"
999,TIME,"The petals shaken from a rose,"
1000,TIME,As though a spirit moved anear.
1001,TIME,Then from the hedge a voice broke clear:—
1002,TIME,
1003,TIME,"“O Time! O Time! Thy dial stay,"
1004,TIME,"And lend to Love thy little day,"
1005,TIME,And make him free of thy domain;
1006,TIME,"And thou shalt not have less of gain,"
1007,TIME,For he must pay thee back again
1008,TIME,In penal hours of longing pain.
1009,TIME,
1010,TIME,“O Time! O Time! Thy labour stay
1011,TIME,Between the sun and moon to-day:
1012,TIME,Tell not thy hours of moon and noon
1013,TIME,Lest they should find us swift and soon
1014,TIME,"To steal from us our secret joy,"
1015,TIME,And give us to the world’s annoy.
1016,TIME,
1017,TIME,"“Let Love be king in hour and place,"
1018,TIME,"And give thy garden for his chase,"
1019,TIME,"Set all with lilies fair and white,"
1020,TIME,"And roses for his heart’s delight,"
1021,TIME,"Both red, and crimson dark, and pale"
1022,TIME,Like snow that hidden fire doth veil:
1023,TIME,"Yea, give them on their thorny stem,"
1024,TIME,"Before thy breath shalt shatter them,"
1025,TIME,That chaplets Love may bind for those
1026,TIME,Who wander in his tangled close.”
1027,TIME,
1028,TIME,"Time, ceasing not his toil, far heard,"
1029,TIME,Gave back to Love this answering word:—
1030,TIME,
1031,TIME,"“Love, to Time dost thou come sueing?"
1032,TIME,"Love, with all thy debt accrueing?"
1033,TIME,Time can give thee no renewing.
1034,TIME,
1035,TIME,"“Ask the hearts thy sceptre schooleth,"
1036,TIME,"Seek the kings thy kingship ruleth,"
1037,TIME,Who is he that Time befooleth?
1038,TIME,
1039,TIME,"“Rest thee, Love, in thine own city,"
1040,TIME,"But of my dominion quit ye,"
1041,TIME,"Time is hard, and hath no pity."
1042,TIME,
1043,TIME,"“Erst for king didst thou disown me,"
1044,TIME,Wouldst thou o’er thy kingdom crown me?
1045,TIME,Thee I serve when thou hast won me.
1046,TIME,
1047,TIME,"“Slave and servant, no man’s master,"
1048,TIME,They who will me slow or faster
1049,TIME,Urge me to their own disaster.
1050,TIME,
1051,TIME,"“Lo! this garden for thy going,"
1052,TIME,"Fair and sweet life-blooms in growing,"
1053,TIME,"Gather, ere its leaves be strowing."
1054,TIME,
1055,TIME,"“Hive thy honey, sweet bestowing,"
1056,TIME,"Take life’s apples, red and glowing,"
1057,TIME,Ere they fall to earth unknowing.
1058,TIME,
1059,TIME,"“Days and hours, perforce, Time gives thee"
1060,TIME,"By the sun’s swift wheel that drives ye,"
1061,TIME,Rest you merry! Time survives Thee.”
1062,TIME,
1063,TIME,"His shadow passed, his voice had died,"
1064,TIME,"And from the rosy covert side,"
1065,TIME,"Clear shining in his goodlihead,"
1066,TIME,Love to my soul came forth and said:—
1067,TIME,
1068,TIME,"“Arise, O Soul! and go with me,"
1069,TIME,And thou shalt read my book and see
1070,TIME,"Things hidden from the wise, and know"
1071,TIME,"The height of joy, the depth of woe,"
1072,TIME,"And hear the seas of passion roll,"
1073,TIME,"And scan the dim strange human scroll,"
1074,TIME,"The writing of its speechless lore,"
1075,TIME,And poesy’s unfathomed store;
1076,TIME,The mystic birth of Song and Art
1077,TIME,In painted chambers of the heart;
1078,TIME,"Love’s histories of bliss and strife,"
1079,TIME,And woven mysteries of life—
1080,TIME,"Yea, all that in Love’s house do dwell"
1081,TIME,Between the doors of heaven and hell.”
1082,TIME,
1083,TIME,Now in this garden lay apart
1084,TIME,"A space contrived with cunning art,"
1085,TIME,Where whoso entered at its gate
1086,TIME,"Might choose of pleasant paths and straight,"
1087,TIME,"Green walled in privet, rose, and yew,"
1088,TIME,Anon that interlaced and drew
1089,TIME,"The wildered wight still to and fro,"
1090,TIME,"Who wists not if to turn or go,"
1091,TIME,"Amid the close entangled ways,"
1092,TIME,"Where oft, for his yet more amaze,"
1093,TIME,"Soft voices, wandering, called his name,"
1094,TIME,"And through the leaves sweet music came,"
1095,TIME,"Clear faces showed like sudden light,"
1096,TIME,To vanish from his longing sight
1097,TIME,Ere he might hope of help to win
1098,TIME,The secret bliss hid far within.
1099,TIME,
1100,TIME,"Few ’scape from out that pleasaunce whole,"
1101,TIME,Few gain the inmost golden goal;
1102,TIME,"Full many wander there forlorn,"
1103,TIME,"Or come out thence sore wounded, torn,"
1104,TIME,To weep their wasted lives forespent.
1105,TIME,
1106,TIME,Thither by Love my soul was bent:
1107,TIME,"Soon in the green maze sweet and still,"
1108,TIME,"I heard the brown and blackbird trill,"
1109,TIME,"Where, linkèd lanes and alleys through,"
1110,TIME,Love led me by his secret clue;
1111,TIME,"And oft the scented briar would cling,"
1112,TIME,Or in the hedge some fluttering thing
1113,TIME,Shake soft adown a summer snow
1114,TIME,"Of roses bloom in overblow,"
1115,TIME,Among the leaves all fair bedight
1116,TIME,And prankt with buds of red and white.
1117,TIME,
1118,TIME,"But still by these Love’s footsteps led,"
1119,TIME,Dim paths before him turned and fled;
1120,TIME,Full oft some sweet or anguished face
1121,TIME,Would part the leaves to seek his grace;
1122,TIME,"For many folk did wander there,"
1123,TIME,"Both gleaming knights and dames most fair,"
1124,TIME,And o’er the level hedge and trim
1125,TIME,Fair showed in quaint attire and slim
1126,TIME,"Of samite, broidery, and brocade,"
1127,TIME,As folk of passèd time portrayed
1128,TIME,"By cunning painters, skilled full well,"
1129,TIME,That mid so goodly sights did dwell.
1130,TIME,
1131,TIME,And there about the stems were hung
1132,TIME,"Sweet names and legends poets sung,"
1133,TIME,"Ywrought on scrolls and tablets fine,"
1134,TIME,And bound with knots that true loves twine;
1135,TIME,And oft the lute’s full tender strain
1136,TIME,"Amid the rose leaves made soft plain,"
1137,TIME,As songs were heard in women’s fame
1138,TIME,That crownèd singers sweet proclaim—
1139,TIME,"Prophets and kings of lyre and pen,"
1140,TIME,Who sound the hearts of silent men
1141,TIME,That hold their word as treasure trove
1142,TIME,In the immortal book of love.
1143,TIME,
1144,TIME,"These all were passed, and in a while,"
1145,TIME,"Love showed my soul a dim green aisle,"
1146,TIME,"And far at end a stone-built stair,"
1147,TIME,"That led us from the woody lair,"
1148,TIME,Forth issuing through a night of trees
1149,TIME,"To know anew the day’s increase,"
1150,TIME,"And there a fragrant arbour found,"
1151,TIME,With clinging jasmine close embound.
1152,TIME,"Soon, in this leafy ambush set,"
1153,TIME,Love bade my soul look forth and let
1154,TIME,Sight wonder at its might or will.
1155,TIME,Then saw I those that wandered still
1156,TIME,"Lost in the green and covert ways,"
1157,TIME,And all the secret of the maze.
1158,TIME,"How there, as folks distraught, misled,"
1159,TIME,"Sought lovers for their lover, who fled"
1160,TIME,"Far from them, or, unwitting, past"
1161,TIME,The prisoning hedge that shut them fast:
1162,TIME,"How, oft their eyes met far amain"
1163,TIME,In severed paths that kept them twain;
1164,TIME,"How, after toil and weary pace,"
1165,TIME,"Some met at last with shamefast face,"
1166,TIME,"And silent lips, or coldly masked"
1167,TIME,With wintry speech their hearts that asked
1168,TIME,"For utterance, and leapt, and cried—"
1169,TIME,Love’s dear deliverance denied.
1170,TIME,
1171,TIME,Thereby great heaviness and pain
1172,TIME,"Had then my soul, and turned again"
1173,TIME,To ask of him who stood beside
1174,TIME,What hope for these might yet betide.
1175,TIME,"Clothed in his godhead strong he stood,"
1176,TIME,"He bent his bow above the wood,"
1177,TIME,And swift the wingèd arrow left
1178,TIME,The quivering string—what heart it cleft
1179,TIME,"My soul ne’er knew, for then the light"
1180,TIME,Of falling day dazed all my sight
1181,TIME,"With splendour, as the level sun"

3521,CXLIV,Amid the garden’s tangled maze;
3522,CXLIV,

3568,CXLIV,"Hill and dale dissolving glide,"

3573,CXLIV,"And shattered temple, still that keep"
3574,CXLIV,"The record of her ancient fame,"

3587,CXLIV,"Fair still her shrine of marble shines,"
3588,CXLIV,Whenas the sun-like moon defines
3589,CXLIV,With opal lights and shadows blue
3590,CXLIV,"That well nigh build the temple new,"
3591,CXLIV,Which day by day o’erlays with gold
3592,CXLIV,As in the sun’s bright flame of old.
3593,CXLIV,Many a morn and eve have we
3594,CXLIV,"Watched him rise and set at sea,"
3595,CXLIV,His foaming steeds with tossing crests
3596,CXLIV,"Turn fire the watery way they breast,"
3597,CXLIV,Where dolphins leaping drive the spray
3598,CXLIV,Before them in their wanton play.
3599,CXLIV,What if the ancient gods no more
3600,CXLIV,Are seen of men on sea or shore?
3601,CXLIV,What if a sterner creed and cold
3602,CXLIV,Did drive them from the Temple’s fold?
3603,CXLIV,"Or pride of rule, or curse of gold,"
3604,CXLIV,"With wasting care that makes youth old,"
3605,CXLIV,"Do blind men’s eyes to all save gain,"

3607,CXLIV,Though greed would all the earth degrade
3608,CXLIV,"And see the world a market made,"
3609,CXLIV,"And drive the peasant from his soil,"
3610,CXLIV,And lay the yoke of hopeless toil
3611,CXLIV,"Upon the millions seeking bread,"
3612,CXLIV,To art and love and beauty dead;
3613,CXLIV,Not all has gone while these have hold
3614,CXLIV,In some true hearts not bought and sold.
3615,CXLIV,
3616,CXLIV,"Though fallen, Aphrodité’s shrines"
3617,CXLIV,"Still through the opal wave she shines,"
3618,CXLIV,"Or, veiled in light doth sail the blue"
3619,CXLIV,Where breaks the foam in iris hue;
3620,CXLIV,And still from dangerous rocks is heard
3621,CXLIV,"The siren’s song Odysseus feared,"
3622,CXLIV,Far wandering from his sea-girt home
3623,CXLIV,In Ithaca across the foam.
3624,CXLIV,The same stars shine above his head
3625,CXLIV,As watch us on our rocking bed;
3626,CXLIV,"As turned his thoughts to child and wife,"
3627,CXLIV,"And homestead dear, and pleasant life;"
3628,CXLIV,"So, tossing on the houseless seas"
3629,CXLIV,Sweet thoughts of home our hearts do please.

3894,A DAY IN EARLY SPRING,Flung wide by flame-winged hours—where he doth wait
3895,A DAY IN EARLY SPRING,Till from thy face the æthereal veil be torn:
3896,A DAY IN EARLY SPRING,Clothed in white splendour and thy train upborne
3897,A DAY IN EARLY SPRING,"By silken handed airs in fluttering state,"

3913,A NIGHT IN MAY,"Unseen, unknown, with summer scents and sights"
3914,A NIGHT IN MAY,Scarce whispered through the modest green of May—
3915,A NIGHT IN MAY,"Who yet beneath the dusk would kiss and play,"
3916,A NIGHT IN MAY,"With mingled softness of mysterious lights,"
3917,A NIGHT IN MAY,"With hidden sweets the silent hour requites,"
3918,A NIGHT IN MAY,Ere from the west he sinks to night away.
3919,A NIGHT IN MAY,
3920,A NIGHT IN MAY,But on the still grey eve what glory breaks!
3921,A NIGHT IN MAY,"A glowing sphere between the trembling trees,"
3922,A NIGHT IN MAY,As though the wondering world returning sees
3923,A NIGHT IN MAY,"A silvern sun a softer day that makes,"
3924,A NIGHT IN MAY,Ere this departs and his last song doth cease
3925,A NIGHT IN MAY,With his last breath that night’s enchantment takes.
