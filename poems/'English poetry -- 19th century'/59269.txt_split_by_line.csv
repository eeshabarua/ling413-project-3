56,PREFACE.,
57,PREFACE.,
58,PREFACE.,"It is now many years ago, nay, more than half a century, since Thomas"
59,PREFACE.,Hood first began to wield the pen which was to do such good service
60,PREFACE.,to literature. The first scrap of his boyish versifying that can now
61,PREFACE.,"be traced, consists of a sort of rhyming description of Dundee, after"
62,PREFACE.,"the manner of Anstey’s Bath Guide, and this is dated 1815.[1] That he"
63,PREFACE.,"was prematurely cut off by disease, accelerated by overwork while in"
64,PREFACE.,"the very prime of his mental powers, is now well known. The Works he"
65,PREFACE.,left behind have gradually but steadily risen in popular esteem and
66,PREFACE.,"circulation ever since his death,--in other countries besides his own,"
67,PREFACE.,"and on both sides of the Atlantic,--so that there are now few writers"
68,PREFACE.,of this century better appreciated and becoming more widely known than
69,PREFACE.,Thomas Hood.
70,PREFACE.,
71,PREFACE.,I believe that one part at least of the secret of this great and
72,PREFACE.,"increasing value for his writings, lies in the fact, that like our"
73,PREFACE.,"great Shakespeare, and even another deep writer and thinker of our own"
74,PREFACE.,"time,--Thackeray,--he wrote such pure, vigorous, intelligible English."
75,PREFACE.,He speaks in his works to the great mass of the people in a tongue they
76,PREFACE.,can understand and thoroughly feel. However far his abundant fancy and
77,PREFACE.,"versatile humour may lead him from the track, there is no obscurity"
78,PREFACE.,to puzzle as well as dazzle. And this almost severe plainness of
79,PREFACE.,"expression serves him well in such poems, for instance, as the “Song"
80,PREFACE.,"of the Shirt,” where the repetition of the homeliest phrases make the"
81,PREFACE.,intensity of the suffering stand out in a more appalling reality.
82,PREFACE.,
83,PREFACE.,It is with a view to meeting the wants of all classes of readers and
84,PREFACE.,"spreading the knowledge of Thomas Hood’s Works still farther, that the"
85,PREFACE.,"present edition has been planned, in a cheap form that will place it"
86,PREFACE.,within everybody’s reach. The publishers have already issued editions
87,PREFACE.,"of all the Works, either complete, or in separate volumes, to suit"
88,PREFACE.,every taste.
89,PREFACE.,
90,PREFACE.,The present edition embraces the complete Works with the original
91,PREFACE.,"illustrations, and also includes some hitherto unpublished dramatic"
92,PREFACE.,"fragments. It will be issued in a convenient periodical form, to be"
93,PREFACE.,"obtained at the option of the purchaser either in Monthly Parts, or"
94,PREFACE.,Quarterly Volumes. The last generation will no doubt welcome in the old
95,PREFACE.,"familiar form the Author’s quaint wood-cut illustrations, as well as"
96,PREFACE.,"the humorous illustrations of George Cruickshank to the “Epping Hunt,”"
97,PREFACE.,with those by Harvey to “Eugene Aram;” and the present generation are
98,PREFACE.,"still too recently mourning the loss of John Leech’s graceful pencil,"
99,PREFACE.,to pass carelessly by his admirable drawings in the “Whimsicalities.”
100,PREFACE.,"The completeness and low price of this edition will, it is hoped, place"
101,PREFACE.,it in the hands of most readers.

111,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
112,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
113,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,The present arrangement of my Father’s works for a complete and uniform
114,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,edition has not been determined on without due deliberation. It
115,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,appeared to me that for the requirements of those--who do not care to
116,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"trace his career as a writer from his first connection with Literature,"
117,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"and to note the gradual development of a genius which, at the time of"
118,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"his death, had not arrived at its fulness--enough is to be found in"
119,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,the edition of the “Serious Poems;” of those of “Wit and Humour;” of
120,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the “Whims and Oddities;” and of two volumes of “Hood’s Own,” already"
121,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,published by Messrs. Moxon.
122,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
123,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"I have therefore considered it best, when called upon to prepare a"
124,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"complete and uniform series of his writings, to throw the materials"
125,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,collected into a form which shall be of interest to more than the
126,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,general reader. By republishing his works in the order in which they
127,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"were written, as far as my most diligent search and most earnest"
128,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"endeavours can establish it, I believe I shall meet the wishes of"
129,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"many of my Father’s admirers and readers, who have contracted, from"
130,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the perusal of his works, an almost friendlike interest, that will be"
131,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"gratified by tracing step by step the bent of his mind, the progress of"
132,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"his intellect, and the maturing of his powers."
133,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
134,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,It may be urged that I have reprinted fugitive articles that might well
135,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,have been omitted without detriment to the Series. To this I might
136,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,answer by pleading that it is only natural that I should place greater
137,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"store by what my Father has written, than one not so nearly related to"
138,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,him would do.
139,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
140,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"But believing, as I do, that the less laboured writings of an author"
141,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,are among the surest indices of his thought and the best tests of his
142,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"genius, I have omitted nothing that I thought would assist the real"
143,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"student of Literature, and its ministers--literary men--to a true"
144,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,estimate of my Father--whether as an author or a man; holding always
145,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"in recollection that quaint wise saying of Selden’s, anent similar"
146,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"trifles--“Take a straw, and throw it up into the air, you may see by"
147,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,that which way the wind is; which you shall not do by casting up a
148,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,stone.”
149,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
150,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,Wherever I have been able to find anything of interest bearing upon the
151,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"works, I have added it as briefly as possible in my notes--giving any"
152,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"alterations of the text, any fragments connected with or relating to"
153,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"portions of it and such explanations of allusions contained in it, as"
154,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,seemed advisable.
155,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
156,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"As far as lies in my power, I have left out nothing that may interest"
157,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"the thoughtful and studious, while I have endeavoured not to weary the"
158,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,cursory reader with long annotations.
159,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
160,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"I have no wish, and indeed no need to deprecate criticism--for whenever"
161,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,it has been my task to prepare anything connected with my Father for
162,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"publication, I have always met with a reception that proved to me"
163,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,how fully my critics have understood the difficulties which I have
164,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,encountered. The kindly spirit in which the “Memorials” of my Father
165,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"were received, encourages me to hope that my sincere desire to perform"
166,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"what I really feel as a sacred duty and responsibility, will be looked"
167,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"on with the same indulgence; for it should be remembered that many, nay"
168,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"most of those contemporaries of my Father, who could have pointed out"
169,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"where his scattered writings were to be found, are dead."
170,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
171,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"To those intimate acquaintances of his who survive, and who have"
172,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,assisted me most materially in my arduous yet most grateful
173,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"undertaking, as well as to numerous friends,--many unknown to me in the"
174,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"flesh,--who have so readily answered my appeals, through the public"
175,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"press, for information and assistance, I tender my most heartfelt"
176,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"thanks,"
177,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,
178,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.,"And am,"

197,COURTEOUS READER!,
198,COURTEOUS READER!,Presuming that you have known something of the Comic Annual from its
199,COURTEOUS READER!,"Child-Hood, when it was first put into half binding and began to run"
200,COURTEOUS READER!,"alone, I make bold to consider you as an old friend of the family, and"
201,COURTEOUS READER!,shall accordingly treat you with all the freedom and confidence that
202,COURTEOUS READER!,pertain to such ripe connexions.
203,COURTEOUS READER!,
204,COURTEOUS READER!,"How many years is it, think you, “since we were first acquent?”"
205,COURTEOUS READER!,
206,COURTEOUS READER!,“By the deep _nine_!” sings out the old bald _Count Fathom_ with the
207,COURTEOUS READER!,"lead-line: no great lapse in the world’s chronology, but a space of"
208,COURTEOUS READER!,"infinite importance in individual history. For instance, it has wrought"
209,COURTEOUS READER!,"a serious change on the body, if not on the mind, of your very humble"
210,COURTEOUS READER!,"servant;--it is not, however, to bespeak your sympathy, or to indulge"
211,COURTEOUS READER!,"in what Lord Byron calls “the gloomy vanity of drawing from self,”"
212,COURTEOUS READER!,that I allude to my personal experience. The Scot and lot character of
213,COURTEOUS READER!,"the dispensation, forbids me to think that the world in general can"
214,COURTEOUS READER!,"be particularly interested in the state of my Household Sufferage, or"
215,COURTEOUS READER!,that the public ear will be as open to my Maladies as to my Melodies.
216,COURTEOUS READER!,"The simple truth is, that, being a wiser but not sadder man, I propose"
217,COURTEOUS READER!,to admit you to my Private View of a system of Practical Cheerful
218,COURTEOUS READER!,"Philosophy, thanks to which, perchance, the cranium of your Humorist"
219,COURTEOUS READER!,is still secure from such a lecture as was delivered over the skull of
220,COURTEOUS READER!,Poor Yorick.
221,COURTEOUS READER!,
222,COURTEOUS READER!,"In the absence of a certain thin “blue-and-yellow” visage, and"
223,COURTEOUS READER!,"attenuated figure,--whose effigies may one day be affixed to the"
224,COURTEOUS READER!,"present work,--you will not be prepared to learn that some of"
225,COURTEOUS READER!,the merriest effusions in the forthcoming numbers have been the
226,COURTEOUS READER!,"relaxations of a gentleman literally enjoying bad health--the carnival,"
227,COURTEOUS READER!,"so to speak, of a personified Jour Maigre. The very fingers so"
228,COURTEOUS READER!,"aristocratically slender, that now hold the pen, hint plainly of the"
229,COURTEOUS READER!,"“_ills_ that _flesh_ is heir to:”--my coats have become great coats, my"
230,COURTEOUS READER!,"pantaloons are turned into trousers, and, by a worse bargain then Peter"
231,COURTEOUS READER!,"Schlemihl’s, I seem to have retained my shadow and sold my substance."
232,COURTEOUS READER!,"In short, as happens to prematurely old port wine, I am of a bad colour"
233,COURTEOUS READER!,with very little body. But what then? That emaciated hand still lends
234,COURTEOUS READER!,a hand to embody in words and sketches the creations or recreations
235,COURTEOUS READER!,of a Merry Fancy: those gaunt sides yet shake heartily as ever at the
236,COURTEOUS READER!,Grotesques and Arabesques and droll Picturesques that my Good Genius
237,COURTEOUS READER!,(a Pantagruelian Familiar) charitably conjures up to divert me from
238,COURTEOUS READER!,"more sombre realities. It was the whim of a late pleasant Comedian, to"
239,COURTEOUS READER!,"suppose a set of spiteful imps sitting up aloft, to aggravate all his"
240,COURTEOUS READER!,petty mundane annoyances; whereas I prefer to believe in the ministry
241,COURTEOUS READER!,"of kindlier Elves, that “nod to me and do me courtesies.” Instead of"
242,COURTEOUS READER!,"scaring away these motes in the sunbeam, I earnestly invoke them, and"
243,COURTEOUS READER!,bid them welcome; for the tricksy spirits make friends with the animal
244,COURTEOUS READER!,"spirits, and do not I, like a father romping with his own urchins,--do"
245,COURTEOUS READER!,not I forget half my cares whilst partaking in their airy gambols? Such
246,COURTEOUS READER!,sports are as wholesome for the mind as the other frolics for the body.
247,COURTEOUS READER!,For on our own treatment of that excellent Friend or terrible Enemy the
248,COURTEOUS READER!,"Imagination, it depends whether we are to be scared and haunted by a"
249,COURTEOUS READER!,"Scratching Fanny, or tended by an affectionate Invisible Girl--like an"
250,COURTEOUS READER!,"unknown love, blessing us with “favours secret, sweet, and precious,”"
251,COURTEOUS READER!,and fondly stealing us from this worky-day world to a sunny sphere of
252,COURTEOUS READER!,her own.
253,COURTEOUS READER!,
254,COURTEOUS READER!,"This is a novel version, Reader, of “Paradise and the Pen,” but it is"
255,COURTEOUS READER!,as true as it is new. How else could I have converted a serious illness
256,COURTEOUS READER!,into a comic wellness--by what other agency could I have transported
257,COURTEOUS READER!,"myself, as a Cockney would say, from _Dull_age to _Grin_age? It was"
258,COURTEOUS READER!,"far from a practical joke to be laid up in ordinary in a foreign land,"
259,COURTEOUS READER!,under the care of Physicians quite as much abroad as myself with the
260,COURTEOUS READER!,case; indeed the shades of the gloaming were stealing over my prospect;
261,COURTEOUS READER!,"but I resolved, that, like the sun, so long as my day lasted, I"
262,COURTEOUS READER!,"would look on the bright side of everything. The raven croaked, but"
263,COURTEOUS READER!,I persuaded myself that it was the nightingale: there was the smell
264,COURTEOUS READER!,"of the mould, but I remembered that it nourished the violets. However"
265,COURTEOUS READER!,"my body might cry craven, my mind luckily had no mind to give in. So,"
266,COURTEOUS READER!,"instead of mounting on the black long-tailed coach horse, she vaulted"
267,COURTEOUS READER!,"on her old Hobby that had capered in the Morris-Dance, and began to"
268,COURTEOUS READER!,"exhort from its back. To be sure, said she, matters look darkly enough;"
269,COURTEOUS READER!,but the more need for the lights. Allons! Courage! Things may take a
270,COURTEOUS READER!,"turn, as the pig said on the spit. Never throw down your cards, but"
271,COURTEOUS READER!,"play out the game. The more certain to lose, the wiser to get all the"
272,COURTEOUS READER!,play you can for your money. Come--give us a song! chirp away like that
273,COURTEOUS READER!,"best of cricket-players, the cricket himself. Be bowled out or caught"
274,COURTEOUS READER!,"out, but never throw down the bat. As to Health, it’s the weather of"
275,COURTEOUS READER!,"the body--it hails, it rains, it blows, it snows, at present, but it"
276,COURTEOUS READER!,"may clear up by-and-by. You cannot eat, you say, and you must not"
277,COURTEOUS READER!,"drink; but laugh and make believe, like the Barber’s wise brother at"
278,COURTEOUS READER!,"the Barmecide’s feast. Then, as to thinness, not to flatter, you look"
279,COURTEOUS READER!,like a lath that has had a split with the carpenter and a fall out with
280,COURTEOUS READER!,the plaster; but so much the better! remember how the smugglers trim
281,COURTEOUS READER!,the sails of the lugger to escape the notice of the cutter. Turn your
282,COURTEOUS READER!,"edge to the old enemy, and mayhap he won’t see you! Come--be alive! You"
283,COURTEOUS READER!,have no more right to slight your life than to neglect your wife--they
284,COURTEOUS READER!,are the two better halves that make a man of you! Is not life your
285,COURTEOUS READER!,means of living? so stick to thy business and thy business will stick
286,COURTEOUS READER!,"to thee. Of course, continued my mind, I am quite disinterested in this"
287,COURTEOUS READER!,"advice--for I am aware of my own immortality but for that very reason,"
288,COURTEOUS READER!,"take care of the mortal body, poor body, and give it as long a day as"
289,COURTEOUS READER!,you can!
290,COURTEOUS READER!,
291,COURTEOUS READER!,"Now, my mind seeming to treat the matter very pleasantly as well as"
292,COURTEOUS READER!,"profitably, I followed her counsel, and instead of calling out for"
293,COURTEOUS READER!,"relief according to the fable, I kept along on my journey, with my"
294,COURTEOUS READER!,"bundle of sticks,--_i.e._ my arms and legs. Between ourselves, it would"
295,COURTEOUS READER!,"have been “extremely inconvenient,” as I once heard the opium-eater"
296,COURTEOUS READER!,"declare, to pay the debt of nature at that particular juncture; nor"
297,COURTEOUS READER!,"do I quite know, to be candid, when it would altogether suit me to"
298,COURTEOUS READER!,"settle it, so, like other parties in narrow circumstances, I laughed,"
299,COURTEOUS READER!,"and gossiped, and played the agreeable with all my might; and as"
300,COURTEOUS READER!,such pleasant behaviour sometimes obtains a respite from a human
301,COURTEOUS READER!,"creditor, who knows but that it may prove successful with the Universal"
302,COURTEOUS READER!,"Mortgagee? At all events, here I am, humming “Jack’s Alive!” and my"
303,COURTEOUS READER!,own dear skilful native physician gives me hopes of a longer lease
304,COURTEOUS READER!,than appeared from the foreign reading of the covenants. He declares
305,COURTEOUS READER!,"indeed, that, anatomically, my heart is lower hung than usual--but what"
306,COURTEOUS READER!,of that? _The more need to keep it up!_ So huzza! my boys! Comas and
307,COURTEOUS READER!,Momus for ever! No Heraclitus! Nine times nine for Democritus! And here
308,COURTEOUS READER!,goes my last bottle of Elixir at the heads of the Blue Devils--be they
309,COURTEOUS READER!,"Prussian blue or indigo, powder-blue or ultramarine!"
310,COURTEOUS READER!,
311,COURTEOUS READER!,"Gentle reader, how do you like this Laughing Philosophy? The joyous"
312,COURTEOUS READER!,"cheers you have just heard, come from a crazy vessel that has clawed,"
313,COURTEOUS READER!,"by miracle, off a lee-shore, and I, the skipper, am sitting down to"
314,COURTEOUS READER!,"my grog, and recounting to you the tale of the past danger, with the"
315,COURTEOUS READER!,"manœuvres that were used to escape the perilous Point. Or rather,"
316,COURTEOUS READER!,"consider me as the Director of a Life Assurance, pointing out to you a"
317,COURTEOUS READER!,"most beneficial policy, whereby you may eke out your natural term. And,"
318,COURTEOUS READER!,"firstly, take precious care of your precious health,--but how, as the"
319,COURTEOUS READER!,"housewives say, to make it keep? Why, then, don’t care and smoke-dry"
320,COURTEOUS READER!,it--or pickle it in everlasting acids--like the Germans. Don’t bury it
321,COURTEOUS READER!,"in a potato-pit, like the Irish. Don’t preserve it in spirits, like"
322,COURTEOUS READER!,"the Barbadians. Don’t salt it down, like the Newfoundlanders. Don’t"
323,COURTEOUS READER!,"pack it in ice, like Captain Back. Don’t parboil it in Hot Baths."
324,COURTEOUS READER!,"Don’t bottle it, like gooseberries. Don’t pot it--and don’t hang it. A"
325,COURTEOUS READER!,"rope is a bad Cordon Sanitaire. Above all, don’t despond about it. Let"
326,COURTEOUS READER!,not anxiety “have thee on the hyp.” Consider your health as your best
327,COURTEOUS READER!,"friend, and think as well of it, in spite of all its foibles, as you"
328,COURTEOUS READER!,"can. For instance, never dream, though you may have a “clever hack,” of"
329,COURTEOUS READER!,"galloping consumption, or indulge in the Meltonian belief, that you are"
330,COURTEOUS READER!,"going the pace. Never fancy every time you cough, that you are going"
331,COURTEOUS READER!,"to coughy-pot. Hold up, as the shooter says, over the heaviest ground."
332,COURTEOUS READER!,Despondency in a nice case is the over-weight that may make you kick
333,COURTEOUS READER!,"the beam and the bucket both at once. In short, as with other cases,"
334,COURTEOUS READER!,"never meet trouble half-way, but let him have the whole walk for his"
335,COURTEOUS READER!,pains; though it should be a Scotch mile and a bittock. I have even
336,COURTEOUS READER!,"known him to give up his visit in sight of the house. Besides, the best"
337,COURTEOUS READER!,fence against care is a ha! ha!--wherefore take care to have one all
338,COURTEOUS READER!,"round you wherever you can. Let your “lungs crow like Chanticleer,”"
339,COURTEOUS READER!,"and as like a GAME cock as possible. It expands the chest, enlarges the"
340,COURTEOUS READER!,"heart, quickens the circulation, and “like a trumpet makes the spirit"
341,COURTEOUS READER!,dance.”
342,COURTEOUS READER!,
343,COURTEOUS READER!,"A fico then for the Chesterfieldian canon, that laughter is an"
344,COURTEOUS READER!,ungenteel emotion. Smiles are tolerated by the very pinks of
345,COURTEOUS READER!,politeness; and a laugh is but the full-blown flower of which a smile
346,COURTEOUS READER!,is the bud. It is a sort of vocal music--a glee in which everybody can
347,COURTEOUS READER!,"take a part:--and “he who bath not laughter in his soul, let no such"
348,COURTEOUS READER!,"man be trusted.” Indeed, there are two classes of Querists particularly"
349,COURTEOUS READER!,to be shunned; thus when you hear a Cui Bono? be sure to leave the
350,COURTEOUS READER!,"room; but if it be Quid Rides? make a point to quit the house, and"
351,COURTEOUS READER!,forget to take its number. None but your dull dogs would give tongue in
352,COURTEOUS READER!,"such a style,--for, as Nimrod says in his “Hunt after Happiness,” “A"
353,COURTEOUS READER!,single _burst_ with Mirth is worth a whole season of _full cries_ with
354,COURTEOUS READER!,Melancholy.”

629,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,a Waverley mystery. The Pugsley Papers were neither rescued from
630,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"a garret, like the Evelyn,--collected from cartridges, like the"
631,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"Culloden,--nor saved, like the Garrick, from being shredded into a"
632,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,snow storm at a Winter Theatre. They were not snatched from a tailor’s
633,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"shears, like the original parchment of Magna Charta. They were neither"
634,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"the Legacy of a Dominie, nor the communications of My Landlord,--a"
635,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"consignment, like the Clinker Letters, from some Rev. Jonathan"
636,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"Dustwich,--nor the waifs and strays of a Twopenny Post Bag. They were"
637,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,not unrolled from ancient papyri. They were none of those that “line
638,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"trunks, clothe spices,” or paper the walls of old attics. They were"
639,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"neither given to me nor sold to me,--nor stolen,--nor borrowed and"
640,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"surreptitiously copied,--nor left in a hackney coach, like Sheridan’s"
641,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"play,--nor misdelivered by a carrier pigeon,--nor dreamt of, like"
642,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"Coleridge’s Kubla Khan,--nor turned up in the Tower, like Milton’s"
643,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"Foundling MS.,--nor dug up,--nor trumped up, like the eastern tales of"
644,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"Horam harum Horam, the son of Asmar,--nor, brought over by Rammohun"
645,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"Roy,--nor translated by Doctor Bowring from the Scandinavian, Batavian,"
646,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"Pomeranian, Spanish, or Danish, or Russian, or Prussian, or any other"
647,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,language dead or living. They were not picked from the Dead Letter
648,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"Office, nor purloined from the British Museum. In short, I cannot, dare"
649,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"not, will not, hint even at the mode of their acquisition: the reader"
650,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"must be content to know, that, in point of authenticity, the Pugsley"
651,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,"Papers are the extreme reverse of Lady L.’s celebrated Autographs,"
652,THE PUGSLEY PAPERS.,which were all written by the proprietor.

661,"DEAR BOB,","Cossacks, Ladies’ double channels, Gentlemen’s stout calf, and ditto"

664,"DEAR BOB,","has been made a rich Squire of by will, and we’ve got a house and"

667,"DEAR BOB,",
668,"DEAR BOB,","Now, Bob, I’ll tell you what I want. I want you to come down here for"

670,"DEAR BOB,",ask your Father to let you come. It’s only ninety mile. If you’re out
671,"DEAR BOB,","of pocket money, you can walk, and beg a lift now and then, or swing"
672,"DEAR BOB,","by the dickies. Put on cordroys, and don’t care for cut behind. The"
673,"DEAR BOB,","two prentices, George and Will, are here to be made farmers of, and"
674,"DEAR BOB,",brother Nick is took home from school to help in agriculture. We like
675,"DEAR BOB,","farming very much, it’s capital fun. Us four have got a gun, and go"
676,"DEAR BOB,","out shooting: it’s a famous good un, and sure to go off if you don’t"
677,"DEAR BOB,","full cock it. Tiger is to be our shooting dog, as soon as he has left"
678,"DEAR BOB,","off killing the sheep. He’s a real savage, and worries cats beautiful."

684,"DEAR BOB,","him, but he’s loose in the paddock, and has neither mane nor tail to"
685,"DEAR BOB,","signify to lay hold of. Isn’t it prime, Bob? You must come. If your"
686,"DEAR BOB,","Mother won’t give your Father leave to allow you,--run away. Remember,"
687,"DEAR BOB,","you turn up Goswell Street to go to Lincolnshire, and ask for Middlefen"
688,"DEAR BOB,","Hall. There’s a pond full of frogs, but we won’t pelt them till you"
689,"DEAR BOB,","come, but let it be before Sunday, as there’s our own orchard to rob,"
690,"DEAR BOB,",and the fruit’s to be gathered on Monday.
691,"DEAR BOB,",
692,"DEAR BOB,","If you like sucking raw eggs, we know where the hens lay, and mother"
693,"DEAR BOB,","don’t; and I’m bound there’s lots of birds’ nests. Do come, Bob,"
694,"DEAR BOB,","and I’ll show you the wasps’ nest, and everything that can make you"
695,"DEAR BOB,",comfortable. I dare say you could borrow your father’s volunteer
696,"DEAR BOB,",musket of him without his knowing of it; but be sure anyhow to bring
697,"DEAR BOB,","the ramrod, as we have mislaid ours by firing it off. Don’t forget"
698,"DEAR BOB,","some bird-lime, Bob--and some fish-hooks--and some different sorts"
699,"DEAR BOB,","of shot--and some gut and some gunpowder and a gentle box, and some"
700,"DEAR BOB,","flints,--some May flies, and a powder horn,--and a landing net and"
701,"DEAR BOB,","a dog-whistle--and some porcupine quills, and a bullet mould--and a"

730,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,",I shall be more pertinaciously superstitious in the astrological

732,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","Hornsey Wood?--Well, the eventful fortune she obscurely intimated,"
733,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","though couched in vague terms, has come to pass in minutest"

735,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","papa should sell off his boot and shoe business at 133, Barbican, to"
736,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","Clack and Son, of 144, Hatton Garden, and that we should retire, in a"

738,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","our great-great maternal uncle, Pollexfen Goldsworthy Wrigglesworth,"

742,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","At the risk of tedium, I will attempt a cursory delineation of our"
743,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","rural paradise, altho’ I feel it would be morally arduous, to give any"
744,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","idea of the romantic scenery of the Lincolnshire Fens. Conceive, as far"
745,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","as the visual organ expands, an immense sequestered level, abundantly"
746,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","irrigated with minute rivulets, and studded with tufted oaks, whilst"
747,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,",more than a hundred windmills diversify the prospect and give a
748,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","revolving animation to the scene. As for our own gardens and grounds,"
749,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","they are a perfect Vauxhall--excepting, of course, the rotunda, the"
750,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","orchestra, the company, the variegated lamps, the fire-works, and those"
751,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,",very lofty trees. But I trust my dear Jemima will supersede topography
752,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,",by ocular inspection; and in the interim I send for acceptance a
753,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","graphical view of the locality, shaded in Indian ink, which will"
754,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,",suffice to convey an idea of the terrestrial verdure and celestial
755,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","azure we enjoy, in lieu of the sable exhalations and architectural"

763,"MY DEAR JEMIMA,","morning. I never could enjoy Bloomfield in Barbican,--but to-day he"

788,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",Providence having been pleased to remove my domestic duties from
789,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","Barbican to Lincolnshire, I trust I shall have strength of constitution"
790,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",to fulfil them as becomes my new allotted line of life. As we are
791,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","not sent into this world to be idle, and Anastasia has declined"
792,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","housewifery, I have undertaken the Dairy, and the Brewery, and the"
793,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","Baking, and the Poultry, the Pigs and the Pastry,--and though I feel"
794,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","fatigued at first, use reconciles to labours and trials, more severe"
795,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",than I at present enjoy. Altho’ things may not turn out to wish at
796,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","present, yet all well-directed efforts are sure to meet reward in the"
797,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","end, and altho’ I have chumped and churned two days running, and it’s"
798,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","nothing yet but curds and whey, I should be wrong to despair of eating"
799,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",butter of my own making before I die. Considering the adulteration
800,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","committed by every article in London, I was never happier in any"
801,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","prospect, than of drinking my own milk, fattening my own calves, and"
802,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","laying my own eggs. We cackle so much I am sure we new-lay somewhere,"
803,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",tho’ I cannot find out our nests; and I am looking every day to have
804,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","chickens, as one pepper-and-salt-coloured hen has been setting these"
805,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",two months. When a poor ignorant bird sets me such an example of
806,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","patience, how can I repine at the hardest domestic drudgery! Mother"
807,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","and I have worked like horses to be sure, ever since we came to the"
808,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","estate; but if we die in it, we know it’s for the good of the family,"
809,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","and to agreeably surprise my Father, who is still in town winding"
810,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","up his books. For my own part, if it was right to look at things so"
811,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","selfishly, I should say I never was so happy in my life; though I own I"
812,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",have cried more since coming here than I ever remember before. You will
813,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","confess my crosses and losses have been unusual trials, when I tell"
814,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","you, out of all my makings, and bakings, and brewings, and preservings,"
815,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",there has been nothing either eatable or drinkable; and what is more
816,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","painful to an affectionate mind,--have half poisoned the whole family"
817,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","with home-made ketchup of toadstools, by mistake for mushrooms. When I"
818,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","reflect that they are preserved, I ought not to grieve about my damsons"
819,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","and bullaces, done by Mrs. Maria Dover’s receipt."
820,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",
821,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","Among other things, we came into a beautiful closet of old china,"
822,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","which, I am shocked to say, is all destroyed by my preserving. The"
823,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","bullaces and damsons fermented, and blew up a great jar with a violent"
824,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","shock that smashed all the tea and coffee cups, and left nothing but"
825,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",the handles hanging in rows on the tenter-hooks. But to a resigned
826,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","spirit there’s always some comfort in calamities, and if the preserves"
827,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","work and ferment so, there’s some hope that my beer will, as it has"
828,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",been a month next Monday in the mash tub. As for the loss of the
829,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","elder wine, candour compels me to say it was my own fault for letting"
830,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",the poor blind little animals crawl into the copper; but experience
831,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",dictates next year not to boil the berries and kittens at the same time.
832,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",
833,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","I mean to attempt cream cheese as soon as we can get cream,--but as yet"
834,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",we can’t drive the Cows home to be milked for the Bull--he has twice
835,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","hunted Grace and me into fits, and kept my poor Mother a whole morning"
836,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","in the pigsty. As I know you like country delicacies, you will receive"
837,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","a pound of my fresh butter when it comes, and I mean to add a cheese as"
838,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",soon as I can get one to stick together. I shall send also some family
839,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","pork for Governess, of our own killing, as we wring a pig’s neck on"
840,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",Saturday. I did hope to give you the unexpected treat of a home-made
841,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","loaf, but it was forgot in the oven from ten till six, and so too black"
842,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","to offer. However, I hope to surprise you with one by Monday’s carrier."
843,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",Anastasia bids me add she will send a nosegay for respected Mrs.
844,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","Tombleson, if the plants don’t die off before, which I am sorry to say"

850,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","one in particular, that must be owned a very pretty idea. When we"
851,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","came, there was a vast number of flower roots, but jumbled without any"
852,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","regular order, till Anastasia trowelled them all up, and set them in"
853,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","again, in the quadrille figures. It must have looked sweetly elegant,"
854,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","if it had agreed with them, but they have all dwindled and drooped like"
855,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,",deep declines and consumptions. Her dahlias and tulips too have turned
856,"MY DEAR MISS JEMIMA,","out nothing but onions and kidney potatoes, and her ten week stocks"

895,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","of the Crockery and Glass, which came down with the dresser, about an"
896,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",hour after its arrival. Perhaps if we hadn’t overloaded it with the
897,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","whole of our breakables, it wouldn’t have given way,--as it is, we"
898,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","have only one plate left, and that’s chipt, and a mug without a spout"

908,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","quite unbeknown to me. We have filled up the vacancy with more, which"

912,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","single W.; for a rich man, I never saw one that wanted so much cleaning"

915,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","besides heaps of good-for-nothing littering straw, that I gave to the"

931,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","by the birds, as I have had all the scarecrows taken down for fear of"
932,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",the children dreaming of them for Bogies. For the same dear little
933,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","sakes I have had the well filled up, and the nasty sharp iron spikes"
934,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","drawn out of all the rakes and harrows. Nobody shall say to my teeth,"

936,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","will enjoy the country when the gipsies have left, but till then, I"

942,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","We have a good many fine fields of hay, which I mean to have reaped"
943,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","directly, wet or shine; for delays are as dangerous as pickles in"
944,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","glazed pans. Perhaps St. Swithin’s is in our favour, for if the"
945,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","stacks are put up dampish they won’t catch fire so easily, if Swing"
946,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",should come into these parts. The poor boys have made themselves
947,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","very industrious in shooting off the birds, and hunting away all the"
948,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","vermin, besides cutting down trees. As I knew it was profitable to fell"
949,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","timber, I directed them to begin with a very ugly straggling hollow"
950,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","tree next the premises, but it fell the wrong way, and knocked down the"
951,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",cow-house. Luckily the poor animals were all in the clover-field at
952,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","the time. George says it wouldn’t have happened but for a violent sow,"
953,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","or rather sow-west,--and it’s likely enough, but it’s an ill wind that"
954,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",blows nothing to nobody.
955,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",
956,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","Having writ last post to Mr P., I have no occasion to make you a"
957,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","country commissioner. Anastasia, indeed, wants to have books about"
958,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","everything, but for my part and Dorothy’s we don’t put much faith in"
959,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","authorised receipts and directions, but trust more to nature and common"
960,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","sense. For instance, in fatting a goose, reason points to sage and"
961,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","onions,--why our own don’t thrive on it, is very mysterious. We have a"
962,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","beautiful poultry yard, only infested with rats,--but I have made up a"
963,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","poison, that, I know by the poor ducks, will kill them if they eat it."
964,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",
965,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","I expected to send you a quantity of wall-fruit, for preserving, and"
966,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","am sorry you bought the brandy beforehand, as it has all vanished in"
967,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","one night by picking and stealing, notwithstanding I had ten dozen"
968,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",of bottles broke on purpose to stick a-top of the wall. But I rather
969,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","think they came over the pales, as George, who is very thoughtless,"
970,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",had driven in all the new tenter-hooks with the points downwards. Our
971,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","apples and pears would have gone too, but luckily we heard a noise in"
972,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","the dark and threw brickbats out of window, that alarmed the thieves"
973,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","by smashing the cowcumber frames. However, I mean on Monday to make"
974,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","sure of the orchard, by gathering the trees,--a pheasant in one’s"
975,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","hand is worth two cock sparrows in a bush. One comfort is, the house"
976,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","dog is very vicious, and won’t let any of us stir in or out after"
977,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","dark--indeed, nothing can be more furious, except the bull, and at me"
978,"MY DEAR MARTHA,","in particular. You would think he knew my inward thoughts, and that I"
979,"MY DEAR MARTHA,",intend to have him roasted whole when we give our grand house-warming

1027,"DEAR BROTHER,","discomfort, absolutely unrivalled for cheapness, and a walk of five"
1028,"DEAR BROTHER,","miles more, through lanes and roads, that for dirt and sludge may"
1029,"DEAR BROTHER,","confidently defy competition,--not to mention turnings and windings,"

1033,"DEAR BROTHER,","the late respectable proprietor, and almost tearing my clothes off my"

1035,"DEAR BROTHER,",
1036,"DEAR BROTHER,",Conscientiously averse to the fallacious statements so much indulged
1037,"DEAR BROTHER,","in by various competitors, truth urges to acknowledge that on arrival,"
1038,"DEAR BROTHER,",I did not find things on such a footing as to ensure universal
1039,"DEAR BROTHER,","satisfaction. Mrs. P., indeed, differs in her statement, but you know"
1040,"DEAR BROTHER,",her success always surpassed the most sanguine expectations. Ever
1041,"DEAR BROTHER,",emulous to merit commendation by the strictest regard to principles
1042,"DEAR BROTHER,","of economy, I found her laid up with lumbago, through her studious"
1043,"DEAR BROTHER,","efforts to please, and Doctor Clarke of Wisbeach in the house"
1044,"DEAR BROTHER,","prescribing for it, but I am sorry to add--no abatement. Dorothy is"
1045,"DEAR BROTHER,","also confined to her bed, by her unremitting assiduity and attention"
1046,"DEAR BROTHER,","in the housekeeping line, and Anastasia the same, from listening for"
1047,"DEAR BROTHER,","nightingales, on a fine July evening, but which is an article not"
1048,"DEAR BROTHER,","always to be warranted to keep its virtue in any climate,--the other"
1049,"DEAR BROTHER,","children, large and small sizes, ditto, ditto, with Grace too ill to"
1050,"DEAR BROTHER,","serve in the nursery,--and the rest of the servants totally unable to"
1051,"DEAR BROTHER,",execute such extensive demands. Such an unprecedented depreciation in
1052,"DEAR BROTHER,","health makes me doubt the quality of country air, so much recommended"
1053,"DEAR BROTHER,","for family use, and whether constitutions have not more eligibility to"
1054,"DEAR BROTHER,",offer that have been regularly town-made.
1055,"DEAR BROTHER,",
1056,"DEAR BROTHER,","Our new residence is a large lonely Mansion, with no connexion with any"
1057,"DEAR BROTHER,","other House, but standing in the heart of Lincolnshire fens, over which"
1058,"DEAR BROTHER,",it looks through an advantageous opening: comprising a great variety of
1059,"DEAR BROTHER,","windmills, and drains, and willow-pollards, and an extensive assortment"
1060,"DEAR BROTHER,","of similar articles, that are not much calculated to invite inspection."
1061,"DEAR BROTHER,","In warehouses for corn, &c., it probably presents unusual advantages"
1062,"DEAR BROTHER,","to the occupier, but candour compels to state that agriculture in this"
1063,"DEAR BROTHER,",part of Lincolnshire is very flat. To supply language on the most
1064,"DEAR BROTHER,","moderate terms, unexampled distress in Spitalfields is nothing to the"
1065,"DEAR BROTHER,",distress in ours. The corn has been deluged with rain of remarkable
1066,"DEAR BROTHER,","durability, without being able to wash the smut out of its ears; and"
1067,"DEAR BROTHER,","with regard to the expected great rise in hay, our stacks have been"
1068,"DEAR BROTHER,","burnt down to the ground, instead of going to the consumer. If the"
1069,"DEAR BROTHER,","hounds hadn’t been out, we might have fetch’d the engines, but the"
1070,"DEAR BROTHER,","hunter threw George on his head, and he only revived to be sensible"
1071,"DEAR BROTHER,",that the entire stock had been disposed of at an immense sacrifice.
1072,"DEAR BROTHER,","The whole amount I fear will be out of book,--as the Norwich Union"
1073,"DEAR BROTHER,","refuses to liquidate the hay, on the ground that the policy was voided"
1074,"DEAR BROTHER,",by the impolicy of putting it up wet. In other articles I am sorry I
1075,"DEAR BROTHER,","must write no alteration. Our bull, after killing the house-dog, and"
1076,"DEAR BROTHER,","tossing William, has gone wild, and had the madness to run away from"
1077,"DEAR BROTHER,","his livelihood, and, what is worse, all the cows after him--except"
1078,"DEAR BROTHER,","those that had burst themselves in the clover field, and a small"
1079,"DEAR BROTHER,","dividend, as I may say, of one in the pound. Another item, the pigs,"
1080,"DEAR BROTHER,","to save bread and milk, have been turned into the woods for acorns,"
1081,"DEAR BROTHER,",and is an article producing no returns--as not one has yet come back.
1082,"DEAR BROTHER,",Poultry ditto. Sedulously cultivating an enlarged connexion in the
1083,"DEAR BROTHER,","Turkey line, such the antipathy to gipsies, the whole breed, geese"
1084,"DEAR BROTHER,","and ducks inclusive, removed themselves from the premises by night,"
1085,"DEAR BROTHER,",directly a strolling camp came and set up in the neighbourhood. To
1086,"DEAR BROTHER,","avoid prolixity, when I came to take stock, there was no stock to"
1087,"DEAR BROTHER,","take--namely, no eggs, no butter, no cheese, no corn, no hay, no bread,"
1088,"DEAR BROTHER,","no beer--no water even--nothing but the mere commodious premises,"
1089,"DEAR BROTHER,","and fixtures and goodwill--and candour compels to add, a very small"
1090,"DEAR BROTHER,",quantity on hand of the last-named particular.
1091,"DEAR BROTHER,",
1092,"DEAR BROTHER,","To add to stagnation, neither of my two sons in the business nor the"
1093,"DEAR BROTHER,",two apprentices have been so diligently punctual in executing country
1094,"DEAR BROTHER,","orders with despatch and fidelity, as laudable ambition desires, but"
1095,"DEAR BROTHER,",have gone about fishing and shooting--and William has suffered a loss
1096,"DEAR BROTHER,","of three fingers, by his unvarying system of high charges. He and"
1097,"DEAR BROTHER,",Richard are likewise both threatened with prosecution for trespassing
1098,"DEAR BROTHER,","on the Hares in the adjoining landed interest, and Nick is obliged to"
1099,"DEAR BROTHER,","decline any active share, by dislocating his shoulder in climbing a"
1100,"DEAR BROTHER,","tall tree for a tom-tit. As for George, tho’ for the first time beyond"
1101,"DEAR BROTHER,","the circumscribed limits of town custom, he indulges vanity in such"
1102,"DEAR BROTHER,","unqualified pretensions to superiority of knowledge in farming, on the"
1103,"DEAR BROTHER,",strength of his grandfather having belonged to the agricultural line
1104,"DEAR BROTHER,","of trade, as renders a wholesale stock of patience barely adequate"
1105,"DEAR BROTHER,",to meet its demands. Thus stimulated to injudicious performance he
1106,"DEAR BROTHER,","is as injurious to the best interests of the country, as blight and"
1107,"DEAR BROTHER,","mildew, and smut and rot, and glanders, and pip, all combined in one"
1108,"DEAR BROTHER,","texture. Between ourselves, the objects of unceasing endeavours,"
1109,"DEAR BROTHER,","united with uncompromising integrity, have been assailed with so much"
1110,"DEAR BROTHER,","deterioration, as makes me humbly desirous of abridging sufferings,"
1111,"DEAR BROTHER,",by resuming business as a Shoe Marter at the old established House.
1112,"DEAR BROTHER,","If Clack & Son, therefore, have not already taken possession and"
1113,"DEAR BROTHER,","respectfully informed the vicinity, will thankfully pay reasonable"
1114,"DEAR BROTHER,",compensation for loss of time and expense incurred by the bargain
1115,"DEAR BROTHER,","being off. In case parties agree, I beg you will authorise Mr. Robins"
1116,"DEAR BROTHER,","to have the honour to dispose of the whole Lincolnshire concern, tho’"
1117,"DEAR BROTHER,",the knocking down of Middlefen Hall will be a severe blow on Mrs. P.

1121,"DEAR BROTHER,","the continent. Example suggests likewise, a good country for hunting"
1122,"DEAR BROTHER,",for fox-hounds--and a prospect too extensive to put in a newspaper.
1123,"DEAR BROTHER,",Circumstances being rendered awkward by the untoward event of the
1124,"DEAR BROTHER,","running away of the cattle, &c., it will be best to say--“The Stock"
1125,"DEAR BROTHER,",to be taken as it stands;”--and an additional favour will be politely
1126,"DEAR BROTHER,","conferred, and the same thankfully acknowledged, if the auctioneer will"
1127,"DEAR BROTHER,",be so kind as bring the next market town ten miles nearer and carry the

1271,"DEAR BROTHER,",We have fixed our Settlement on the left bank of the river. In
1272,"DEAR BROTHER,",crossing the rapids we lost most of our heavy baggage and all our
1273,"DEAR BROTHER,","iron work, but by great good fortune we saved Mrs. Paisley’s grand"
1274,"DEAR BROTHER,",piano and the children’s toys. Our infant city consists of three log
1275,"DEAR BROTHER,","huts and one of clay, which, however, on the second day, fell in to"
1276,"DEAR BROTHER,","the ground landlords. We have now built it up again;--and, all things"
1277,"DEAR BROTHER,","considered, are as comfortable as we could expect--and have christened"
1278,"DEAR BROTHER,","our settlement New London, in compliment to the Old Metropolis. We"
1279,"DEAR BROTHER,",have one of the log houses to ourselves--or at least shall have when
1280,"DEAR BROTHER,",we have built a new hog-sty. We burnt down the first one in making a
1281,"DEAR BROTHER,","bonfire to keep off the wild beasts, and for the present the pigs are"
1282,"DEAR BROTHER,",in the parlour. As yet our rooms are rather usefully than elegantly
1283,"DEAR BROTHER,","furnished. We have gutted the Grand Upright, and it makes a convenient"
1284,"DEAR BROTHER,","cupboard,--the chairs were obliged to blaze at our bivouacs, but thank"
1285,"DEAR BROTHER,","Heaven we have never leisure to sit down, and so do not miss them."
1286,"DEAR BROTHER,","My boys are contented, and will be well when they have got over some"
1287,"DEAR BROTHER,","awkward accidents in lopping and felling. Mrs. P. grumbles a little,"
1288,"DEAR BROTHER,",but it is her custom to lament most when she is in the midst of
1289,"DEAR BROTHER,","comforts. She complains of solitude, and says she could enjoy the very"
1290,"DEAR BROTHER,",stiffest of stiff visits.

1294,"DEAR BROTHER,","The first time we lighted a fire in our new abode, a large serpent came"
1295,"DEAR BROTHER,","down the chimney, which I looked upon as a good omen. However, as Mrs."
1296,"DEAR BROTHER,","P. is not partial to snakes, and the heat is supposed to attract those"
1297,"DEAR BROTHER,","reptiles, we have dispensed with fires ever since. As for wild beasts,"
1298,"DEAR BROTHER,",we hear them howling and roaring round the fence every night from dusk
1299,"DEAR BROTHER,","till daylight, but we have only been inconvenienced by one Lion. The"
1300,"DEAR BROTHER,","first time he came, in order to get rid of the brute peaceably, we"
1301,"DEAR BROTHER,","turned out an old ewe, with which he was well satisfied;--but ever"
1302,"DEAR BROTHER,",since he comes to us as regular as clock-work for his mutton; and if
1303,"DEAR BROTHER,","we do not soon contrive to cut his acquaintance, we shall hardly have"
1304,"DEAR BROTHER,","a sheep in the flock. It would have been easy to shoot him, being well"
1305,"DEAR BROTHER,","provided with muskets, but Barnaby mistook our remnant of gunpowder"
1306,"DEAR BROTHER,","for onion seed, and sowed it all in the kitchen garden. We did try to"
1307,"DEAR BROTHER,","trap him into a pitfall; but after twice catching Mrs. P., and every"
1308,"DEAR BROTHER,","one of the children in turn, it was given up. They are now, however,"
1309,"DEAR BROTHER,","perfectly at ease about the animal, for they never stir out of doors"
1310,"DEAR BROTHER,","at all, and to make them quite comfortable, I have blocked up all the"
1311,"DEAR BROTHER,",windows and barricaded the door.
1312,"DEAR BROTHER,",
1313,"DEAR BROTHER,","We have lost only one of our number since we came; namely, Diggory, the"
1314,"DEAR BROTHER,","market gardener, from Glasgow, who went out one morning to botanise,"
1315,"DEAR BROTHER,","and never came back. I am much surprised at his absconding, as he"
1316,"DEAR BROTHER,","had nothing but a spade to go off with. Chippendale, the carpenter,"
1317,"DEAR BROTHER,","was sent after him, but did not return; and Gregory, the smith, has"
1318,"DEAR BROTHER,","been out after them these two days. I have just despatched Mudge,"
1319,"DEAR BROTHER,","the Herdsman, to look for all three, and hope he will soon give a"
1320,"DEAR BROTHER,","good account of them, as they are the most useful men in the whole"

1325,"DEAR BROTHER,","The river Mudiboo is deep, and rapid, and said to swarm with"
1326,"DEAR BROTHER,","alligators, though I have heard but of three being seen at one"
1327,"DEAR BROTHER,","time, and none of those above eighteen feet long; this however, is"
1328,"DEAR BROTHER,","immaterial, as we do not use the river fluid, which is thick and dirty,"
1329,"DEAR BROTHER,",but draw all our water from natural wells and tanks. Poisonous springs
1330,"DEAR BROTHER,","are rather common, but are easily distinguished by containing no fish"
1331,"DEAR BROTHER,","or living animal. Those, however, which swarm with frogs, toads, newts,"

1338,"DEAR BROTHER,",
1339,"DEAR BROTHER,",The drawback I speak of is this: although I have never seen any one of
1340,"DEAR BROTHER,","the creatures, it is too certain that the mountains are inhabited by a"
1341,"DEAR BROTHER,","race of Monkeys, whose cunning and mischievous talents exceed even the"
1342,"DEAR BROTHER,",most incredible stories of their tribe. No human art or vigilance seems
1343,"DEAR BROTHER,","of avail; we have planned ambuscades, and watched night after night,"
1344,"DEAR BROTHER,","but no attempt has been made; yet the moment the guard was relaxed, we"
1345,"DEAR BROTHER,",were stripped without mercy. I am convinced they must have had spies
1346,"DEAR BROTHER,","night and day on our motions, yet so secretly and cautiously, that no"
1347,"DEAR BROTHER,",glimpse of one has yet been seen by any of our people. Our last crop

1513,THE LAST SHILLING.,"He was evidently a foreigner, and poor. As I sat at the opposite corner"
1514,THE LAST SHILLING.,"of the Southgate stage, I took a mental inventory of his wardrobe."
1515,THE LAST SHILLING.,"A military cloak much the worse for wear,--a blue coat, the worse"
1516,THE LAST SHILLING.,"for tear,--a napless hat--a shirt neither white nor brown--a pair of"
1517,THE LAST SHILLING.,"mud-colour gloves, open at each thumb--gray trousers too short for his"
1518,THE LAST SHILLING.,legs--and brown boots too long for his feet.
1519,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1520,THE LAST SHILLING.,"From some words he dropt, I found that he had come direct from Paris,"
1521,THE LAST SHILLING.,"to undertake the duties of French teacher, at an English academy; and"
1522,THE LAST SHILLING.,"his companion, the English classical usher, had been sent to London, to"
1523,THE LAST SHILLING.,meet and conduct him to his suburban destination.
1524,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1525,THE LAST SHILLING.,"Poor devil, thought I, thou art going into a bitter bad line"
1526,THE LAST SHILLING.,of business; and the hundredth share which I had taken in the
1527,THE LAST SHILLING.,boyish persecutions of my own French master--an emigré of the old
1528,THE LAST SHILLING.,noblesse--smote violently on my conscience. At Edmonton the coach
1529,THE LAST SHILLING.,"stopped. The coachman alighted, pulled the bell of a mansion inscribed"
1530,THE LAST SHILLING.,"in large letters, Vespasian House; and deposited the foreigner’s trunks"
1531,THE LAST SHILLING.,and boxes on the footpath. The English classical usher stepped briskly
1532,THE LAST SHILLING.,"out, and deposited a shilling in the coachman’s anticipatory hand."
1533,THE LAST SHILLING.,"Monsieur followed the example, and with some precipitation prepared to"
1534,THE LAST SHILLING.,"enter the gate of the fore-garden, but the driver stood in the way."
1535,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1536,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“I want another shilling,” said the coachman."
1537,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1538,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“You agreed to take a shilling a-head,” said the English master."
1539,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1540,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“You said you would take one shilling for my head,” said the French"
1541,THE LAST SHILLING.,master.
1542,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1543,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“It’s for the luggage,” said the coachman."
1544,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1545,THE LAST SHILLING.,The Frenchman seemed thunderstruck; but there was no help for
1546,THE LAST SHILLING.,"it. He pulled out a small weasel-bellied, brown silk purse, but"
1547,THE LAST SHILLING.,there was nothing in it save a medal of Napoleon. Then he felt his
1548,THE LAST SHILLING.,"breast-pockets, then his side-pockets, and then his waistcoat-pockets;"
1549,THE LAST SHILLING.,"but they were all empty, excepting a metal snuff-box, and that was"
1550,THE LAST SHILLING.,"empty too. Lastly he felt the pockets in the flaps of his coat, taking"
1551,THE LAST SHILLING.,"out a meagre would-be white handkerchief, and shaking it; but not a"
1552,THE LAST SHILLING.,dump. I rather suspect he anticipated the result--but he went thro’ the
1553,THE LAST SHILLING.,"operations _seriatim_, with the true French gravity. At last he turned"
1554,THE LAST SHILLING.,"to his companion, with a “Mistare Barbiere, be as good to lend me one"
1555,THE LAST SHILLING.,shilling.”
1556,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1557,THE LAST SHILLING.,"Mr. Barber, thus appealed to, went through something of the same"
1558,THE LAST SHILLING.,"ceremony. Like a blue-bottle cleaning itself, he passed his hands over"
1559,THE LAST SHILLING.,"his breast--round his hips, and down the outside of his thighs,--but"
1560,THE LAST SHILLING.,the sense of feeling could detect nothing like a coin.
1561,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1562,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“You agreed for a shilling, and you shall have no more,” said the man"
1563,THE LAST SHILLING.,with empty pockets.
1564,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1565,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“No--no--no--you shall have no more,” said the moneyless Frenchman."
1566,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1567,THE LAST SHILLING.,"By this time the housemaid of Vespasian House, tired of standing with"
1568,THE LAST SHILLING.,"the door in her hand, had come down to the garden-gate, and, willing to"
1569,THE LAST SHILLING.,"make herself generally useful, laid her hand on one of the Foreigner’s"
1570,THE LAST SHILLING.,trunks.
1571,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1572,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“It shan’t go till I’m paid my shilling,” said the coachman, taking"
1573,THE LAST SHILLING.,hold of the handle at the other end.
1574,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1575,THE LAST SHILLING.,"The good-natured housemaid instantly let go of the trunk, and seemed"
1576,THE LAST SHILLING.,"suddenly to be bent double by a violent cramp, or stitch, in her right"
1577,THE LAST SHILLING.,"side,--while her hand groped busily under her gown. But it was in vain."
1578,THE LAST SHILLING.,"There was nothing in that pocket but some curl-papers, and a brass"
1579,THE LAST SHILLING.,thimble.
1580,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1581,THE LAST SHILLING.,The stitch or cramp then seemed to attack her other side; again she
1582,THE LAST SHILLING.,"stooped and fumbled, while Hope and Doubt struggled together on her"
1583,THE LAST SHILLING.,"rosy face. At last Hope triumphed,--from the extremest corner of"
1584,THE LAST SHILLING.,"the huge dimity pouch she fished up a solitary coin, and thrust it"
1585,THE LAST SHILLING.,exultingly into the obdurate palm.
1586,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1587,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“It won’t do,” said the coachman, casting a wary eye on the metal, and"
1588,THE LAST SHILLING.,holding out for the inspection of the trio a silver-washed coronation
1589,THE LAST SHILLING.,"medal, which had been purchased of a Jew for twopence the year before."
1590,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1591,THE LAST SHILLING.,"The poor girl quietly set down the trunk which she had again taken up,"
1592,THE LAST SHILLING.,and restored the deceitful medal to her pocket. In the meantime the
1593,THE LAST SHILLING.,"arithmetical usher had arrived at the gate in his way out, but was"
1594,THE LAST SHILLING.,stopped by the embargo on the luggage. “What’s the matter now?” asked
1595,THE LAST SHILLING.,the man of figures.
1596,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1597,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“If you please, Sir,” said the housemaid, dropping a low courtesy,"
1598,THE LAST SHILLING.,“it’s this impudent fellow of a coachman will stand here for his
1599,THE LAST SHILLING.,rights.”
1600,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1601,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“He wants a shilling more than his fare,” said Mr. Barber."
1602,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1603,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“He does want more than his fare shilling,” reiterated the Frenchman."

1605,THE LAST SHILLING.,“Coachman! what the devil are we waiting here for?” shouted a
1606,THE LAST SHILLING.,stentorian voice from the rear of the stage.
1607,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1608,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“Bless me, John, are we to stay here all day?” cried a shrill voice"
1609,THE LAST SHILLING.,from the stage’s interior.
1610,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1611,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“If you don’t get up shortly I shall get down,” bellowed a voice from"
1612,THE LAST SHILLING.,the box.
1613,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1614,THE LAST SHILLING.,"At this crisis the English usher drew his fellow-tutor aside, and"
1615,THE LAST SHILLING.,whispered something in his ear that made him go through the old manual
1616,THE LAST SHILLING.,exercise. He slapped his pantaloons--flapped his coat tails--and felt
1617,THE LAST SHILLING.,"about his bosom--“I haven’t got one,” said he, and with a shake of the"
1618,THE LAST SHILLING.,"head and a hurried bow, he set off at the pace of a twopenny postman."
1619,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1620,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“I a’n’t going to stand here all day,” said the coachman, getting out"
1621,THE LAST SHILLING.,of all reasonable patience.
1622,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1623,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“You’re an infernal scoundrelly villain,” said Mr. Barber, getting out"
1624,THE LAST SHILLING.,of all classical English.
1625,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1626,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“You are a--what Mr. Barber says,” said the Foreigner."
1627,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1628,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“Thank God and his goodness,” ejaculated the housemaid, “here comes the"
1629,THE LAST SHILLING.,Doctor;” and the portly figure of the pedagogue himself came striding
1630,THE LAST SHILLING.,pompously down the gravel-walk. He had two thick lips and a double
1631,THE LAST SHILLING.,"chin, which all began wagging together."
1632,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1633,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“Well, well; what’s all this argumentative elocution? I command"
1634,THE LAST SHILLING.,taciturnity!”
1635,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1636,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“I’m a shilling short,” said the coachman."
1637,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1638,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“He says he has got one short shilling,” said the Foreigner."
1639,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1640,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“Poo--poo--poo,” said the thick-lips and double-chin. “Pay the fellow"
1641,THE LAST SHILLING.,"his superfluous claim, and appeal to magisterial authority.”"
1642,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1643,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“It’s what we mean to do, Sir,” said the English usher, “but”--and he"
1644,THE LAST SHILLING.,laid his lips mysteriously to the Doctor’s ear.
1645,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1646,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“A pecuniary bagatelle,” said the Doctor. “It’s palpable"
1647,THE LAST SHILLING.,"extortion,--but I’ll disburse it,--and you have a legislatorial"
1648,THE LAST SHILLING.,"remedy for his avaricious demands.” As the man of pomp said this,"
1649,THE LAST SHILLING.,he thrust his fore finger into an empty waistcoat-pocket--then into
1650,THE LAST SHILLING.,its fellow--and then into every pocket he had--but without any other
1651,THE LAST SHILLING.,"product than a bunch of keys, two ginger lozenges, and the French mark."
1652,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1653,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“It’s very peculiar,” said the Doctor. “I had a prepossession of having"
1654,THE LAST SHILLING.,currency to that amount. The coachman must call to-morrow for it at
1655,THE LAST SHILLING.,Vespasian House--or stay--I perceive my housekeeper. Mrs. Plummer! pray
1656,THE LAST SHILLING.,just step hither and liquidate this little commercial obligation.”
1657,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1658,THE LAST SHILLING.,"Now, whether Mrs. Plummer had or had not a shilling, Mrs. Plummer only"
1659,THE LAST SHILLING.,"knows; for she did not condescend to make any search for it,--and if"
1660,THE LAST SHILLING.,"she had none, she was right not to take the trouble. However, she"
1661,THE LAST SHILLING.,attempted to carry the point by a _coup de main_. Snatching up one of
1662,THE LAST SHILLING.,"the boxes, she motioned the housemaid to do the like, exclaiming in"
1663,THE LAST SHILLING.,"a shrill treble key,--“Here’s a pretty work indeed, about a paltry"
1664,THE LAST SHILLING.,"shilling! If it’s worth having, it’s worth calling again for,--and I"
1665,THE LAST SHILLING.,suppose Vespasian House is not going to run away!”
1666,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1667,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“But may be I am,” said the inflexible coachman, seizing a trunk with"
1668,THE LAST SHILLING.,each hand.
1669,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1670,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“John, I insist on being let out,” screamed the lady in the coach. “I"
1671,THE LAST SHILLING.,"shall be too late for dinner,” roared the Thunderer in the dickey. As"
1672,THE LAST SHILLING.,"for the passenger on the box, he had made off during the latter part of"
1673,THE LAST SHILLING.,the altercation.
1674,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1675,THE LAST SHILLING.,“What shall we do?” said the English Classical Usher.
1676,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1677,THE LAST SHILLING.,“God and his goodness only knows!” said the housemaid.
1678,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1679,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“I am a stranger in this country,” said the Frenchman."
1680,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1681,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“You must pay the money,” said the coachman."
1682,THE LAST SHILLING.,
1683,THE LAST SHILLING.,"“And here it is, you brute,” said Mrs. Plummer, who had made a trip to"
1684,THE LAST SHILLING.,"the house in the meantime; but whether she had coined it, or raised it"
1685,THE LAST SHILLING.,"by a subscription among the pupils, I know no more than"

1761,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,

1763,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,My old Schoolmaster is dead. He “died of a stroke;” and I wonder
1764,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,none of his pupils have ever done the same. I have been flogged by
1765,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"many masters, but his rod, like Aaron’s, swallowed up all the rest."
1766,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,We have often wished that he whipped on the principle of Italian
1767,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"penmanship,--up strokes heavy and down strokes light; but he did it in"
1768,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"English round hand, and we used to think with a very hard pen. Such was"
1769,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"his love of flogging, that for some failure in English composition,"
1770,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,after having been well corrected I have been ordered to be revised.
1771,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"I have heard of a road to learning, and he did justice to it; we"
1772,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,certainly never went a stage in education without being well horsed.
1773,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"The mantle of Dr. Busby descended on his shoulders, and on ours. There"
1774,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"was but one tree in the play-ground--a birch, but it never had a twig"
1775,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,or leaf upon it. Spring or summer it always looked as bare as if the
1776,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,weather had been cutting at the latter end of the year. Pictures they
1777,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"say are incentives to learning, and certainly we never got through a"
1778,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"page without cuts; for instance, I do not recollect a Latin article"
1779,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,without a tail-piece. All the Latin at that school might be comprised
1780,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,in one line--

1786,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"storm of bamboo that really carried on the illusion, and made me think"
1787,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,for the time that I was assaulted by a set of savages. He seemed to
1788,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"consider a boy as a bear’s cub, and set himself literally to lick him"
1789,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,into shape. He was so particularly fond of striking us with a leather
1790,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,strap on the flats of our hands that he never allowed them a day’s
1791,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,rest. There was no such thing as a Palm Sunday in our calendar. In one
1792,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"word, he was disinterestedly cruel, and used as industriously to strike"
1793,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"for nothing as other workmen strike for wages. Some of the elder boys,"
1794,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"who had read Smollett, christened him Roderick, from his often hitting"
1795,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"like Random, and being so partial to Strap."
1796,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,
1797,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,His death was characteristic. After making his will he sent for Mr.
1798,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"Taddy, the head usher, and addressed him as follows: “It is all over,"
1799,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,Mr. Taddy--I am sinking fast--I am going from the terrestrial globe--to
1800,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,the celestial--and have promised Tomkins a flogging--mind he has
1801,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,it--and don’t let him pick off the buds--I have asked Aristotle”--(here
1802,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,his head wandered)--“and he says I cannot live an hour--I don’t like
1803,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,that black horse grinning at me--cane him soundly for not knowing
1804,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"his verbs--Castigo te, non quod odio habeam--Oh, Mr. Taddy, it’s"
1805,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,breaking up with me--the vacation’s coming--There is that black horse
1806,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"again--Dulcis moriens reminiscitur--we are short of canes--Mr. Taddy,"
1807,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"don’t let the school get into disorder when I am gone--I’m afraid,"
1808,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,through my illness--the boys have gone back in their flogging--I feel
1809,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,a strange feeling all over me--Is the new pupil come?--I trust I have
1810,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,done my duty--and have made my will--and left all”--(here his head
1811,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"wandered again)--“to Mr. Souter, the school bookseller--Mr. Taddy, I"
1812,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,invite you to my funeral--make the boys walk in good order--and take
1813,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,care of the crossings.--My sight is getting dim--write to Mrs. B. at
1814,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,Margate--and inform her--we break up on the 21st.--The school-door
1815,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,is left open--- I am very cold--where is my ruler gone--I will make
1816,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"him feel--John, light the school lamps--I cannot see a line--Oh Mr."
1817,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,Taddy--venit hora--my hour is come--I am dying--thou art dying--he--is
1818,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,dying.--We--are--dying--you--are--dy”----The voice ceased. He made
1819,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"a feeble motion with his hands, as if in the act of ruling a"
1820,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,copy-book--“the _ruling_ passion strong in death”--and expired.
1821,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,
1822,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"An epitaph, composed by himself, was discovered in his desk,--with an"
1823,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,unpublished pamphlet against Tom Paine. The Epitaph was so stuffed
1824,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"with quotations from Homer and Virgil, and almost every Greek or Latin"
1825,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,"author beside, that the mason who was consulted by the Widow declined"
1826,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,to lithograph it under a Hundred Pounds. The Dominie consequently
1827,THE DEATH OF THE DOMINIE.,reposes under no more Latin than HIC JACET;--and without a single

2010,"RESPECTED SIR,","magnitude of their inferences, beyond the drawing of Moux’s dray"

2012,"RESPECTED SIR,",

2014,"RESPECTED SIR,","indicating his age to be about forty-five, and the raggedness of"
2015,"RESPECTED SIR,",which gave a great air of mental ingenuity and intelligence to his
2016,"RESPECTED SIR,","countenance, was introduced by the officers to the Lord Mayor. It was"
2017,"RESPECTED SIR,",evident from his preliminary bow that he had made some discoveries in
2018,"RESPECTED SIR,","the art of poetry, which he wished to lay before his Lordship, but the"
2019,"RESPECTED SIR,",Lord Mayor perceiving by his accent that he had already submitted his
2020,"RESPECTED SIR,","project to several of the leading Publishers, referred him back to the"
2021,"RESPECTED SIR,","same jurisdiction, and the unfortunate Votary of the Muses withdrew,"
2022,"RESPECTED SIR,","declaring by another bow, that he should offer his plan to the Editor"
2023,"RESPECTED SIR,",of the Comic Annual.”
2024,"RESPECTED SIR,",
2025,"RESPECTED SIR,","The unfortunate above referred to, Sir, is myself, and with regard to"
2026,"RESPECTED SIR,","the Muses, indeed a votary, though not a £10 one, if the qualification"
2027,"RESPECTED SIR,",depends on my pocket--but for the idea of addressing myself to the
2028,"RESPECTED SIR,","Editor of the Comic Annual, I am indebted solely to the assumption"
2029,"RESPECTED SIR,","of the gentlemen of the Press. That I have made a discovery is true,"
2030,"RESPECTED SIR,","in common with Hervey, and Herschell, and Galileo, and Roger Bacon,"
2031,"RESPECTED SIR,","or rather, I should say, with Columbus,--my invention concerning a"
2032,"RESPECTED SIR,","whole hemisphere, as it were, in the world of poetry--in short, the"
2033,"RESPECTED SIR,",whole continent of blank verse. To an immense number of readers this
2034,"RESPECTED SIR,","literary land has been hitherto a complete terra incognita, and from"
2035,"RESPECTED SIR,","one sole reason,--the want of that harmony which makes the close"
2036,"RESPECTED SIR,",of one line chime with the end of another. They have no relish for
2037,"RESPECTED SIR,","numbers that turn up blank, and wonder accordingly at the epithet of"
2038,"RESPECTED SIR,","“Prize,” prefixed to Poems of the kind which emanate in--I was going"
2039,"RESPECTED SIR,",to say from--the University of Oxford. Thus many very worthy members
2040,"RESPECTED SIR,","of society are unable to appreciate the Paradise Lost, the Task, the"
2041,"RESPECTED SIR,","Chase, or the Seasons,--the Winter especially,--without rhyme. Others,"
2042,"RESPECTED SIR,","again, can read the Poems in question, but with a limited enjoyment;"
2043,"RESPECTED SIR,",as certain persons can admire the architectural beauties of Salisbury
2044,"RESPECTED SIR,","steeple, but would like it better with a ring of bells. For either"
2045,"RESPECTED SIR,","of these tastes my discovery will provide, without affronting the"
2046,"RESPECTED SIR,",palate of any other; for although the lover of rhyme will find in it
2047,"RESPECTED SIR,","a prodigality hitherto unknown, the heroic character of blank verse"
2048,"RESPECTED SIR,","will not suffer in the least, but each line will “do as it likes with"
2049,"RESPECTED SIR,","its own,” and sound as independently of the next as “milkmaid,” and"
2050,"RESPECTED SIR,","“water-carrier.” I have the honour to subjoin a specimen--and if,"

2288,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","they always tasted, as the young gentlemen affirmed, “like a quart"
2289,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",of berries sharpened to a pint.” In short it always required six
2290,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","pennyworth of lollipops and bullseyes, a lick of honey, a dip of"
2291,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","treacle, and a pick at a grocer’s hogshead, to sweeten a visit at Aunt"
2292,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",Morbid’s.
2293,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",
2294,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","To tell the truth, her own temper soured a little under the"
2295,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",prohibition. She could not persuade the sugar-eaters that they were
2296,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","Vampyres;--instead of practising, or even admiring her self-denial,"
2297,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","they laughed at it; and one wicked wag even compared her, in allusion"
2298,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","to her acerbity and her privation, to a crab without _the nippers_."
2299,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",She persevered notwithstanding in her system; and to the constancy
2300,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","of a martyr added something of the wilfulness of a bigot:--indeed,"
2301,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","it was hinted by patrons and patronesses of white charities, that"
2302,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",European objects had not their _fair_ share in her benevolence. She
2303,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","was pre-eminently the friend of the blacks. Howbeit, for all her"
2304,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","sacrifices, not a lash was averted from their sable backs. She had"
2305,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","raised discontent in the kitchen, she had disgusted her acquaintance,"
2306,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","sickened her friends, and given her own dear little nephews the"
2307,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","stomach-ache, without saving Quashy from one cut of the driver’s"
2308,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","whip, or diverting a single kick from the shins of Sambo. Her grocer"
2309,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","complained loudly of being called a dealer in human gore, yet not one"
2310,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",hogshead the less was imported from the Plantations. By an error common
2311,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",to all her class she mistook a negative for a positive principle; and
2312,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","persuaded herself that by _not_ preserving damsons, she preserved the"
2313,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","Niggers; that by _not_ sweetening her own cup, she was dulcifying the"
2314,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",lot of all her sable brethren in bondage. She persevered accordingly in
2315,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",setting her face against sugar instead of slavery; against the plant
2316,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",instead of the planter; and had actually abstained for six months from
2317,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","the forbidden article, when a circumstance occurred that roused her"
2318,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",sympathies into more active exertions. It pleased an American lady
2319,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","to import with her a black female servant, whom she rather abruptly"
2320,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","dismissed, on her arrival in England. The case was considered by the"
2321,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","Hampshire Telegraph of that day, as one of GREAT HARDSHIP; the"
2322,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",paragraph went the round of the papers and in due time attracted the
2323,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","notice of Miss Morbid. It was precisely addressed to her sensibilities,"
2324,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",and there was a “Try Warren” tone about it that proved irresistible.
2325,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","She read--and wrote--and in the course of one little week, her domestic"
2326,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",establishment was maliciously but truly described as consisting of “two
2327,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",white Slaves and a black Companion.”
2328,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",
2329,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","The adopted protégé was, in reality, a strapping clumsy Negress, as"
2330,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","ugly as sin, and with no other merit than that of being of the same"
2331,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","colour as the crow. She was artful, sullen, gluttonous, and above"
2332,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","all so intolerably indolent, that if she had been literally “carved"
2333,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","in ebony,” as old Fuller says, she could scarcely have been of less"
2334,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",service to her protectress. Her notion of Free Labour seemed to
2335,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","translate it into laziness, and taking liberties; and, as she seriously"
2336,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","added to the work of her fellow-servants, without at all contributing"
2337,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","to their comfort, they soon looked upon her as a complete nuisance."
2338,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","The housemaid dubbed her “a Divil,”--the cook roundly compared her to"
2339,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","“a mischivus beast, as runs out on a herd o’ black cattle;”--and both"
2340,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",concurred in the policy of laying all household sins upon the sooty
2341,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",shoulders--just as slatterns select a colour that hides the dirt.
2342,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",It is certain that shortly after the instalment of the negress in
2343,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","the family a moral disease broke out with considerable violence, and"
2344,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","justly or not, the odium was attributed to the new comer. Its name was"
2345,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","theft. First, there was a shilling short in some loose change--next,"
2346,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",a missing half-crown from the mantelpiece--then there was a stir with
2347,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","a tea-spoon--anon, a piece of work about a thimble. Things went,"
2348,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","nobody knew how--the “Divil” of course excepted. The Cook _could_, the"
2349,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","Housemaid _would_, and Dinah _should_, and _ought_ to take an oath,"
2350,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","declaratory of innocence, before the mayor; but as Dinah did not"
2351,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","volunteer an affidavit like the others, there was no doubt of her guilt"
2352,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",in the kitchen.
2353,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",
2354,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","Miss Morbid, however, came to a very different conclusion. She thought"
2355,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","that whites who could eat sugar, were capable of any atrocity, and"
2356,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","had not forgotten the stand which had been made by the “pale faces,”"
2357,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",in favour of the obnoxious article. The cook especially incurred
2358,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",suspicion; for she had been notorious aforetime for a lavish hand in
2359,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","sweetening, and was accordingly quite equal to the double turpitude of"
2360,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",stealing and bearing false witness. In fact the mistress had arrived
2361,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",at the determination of giving both her white hussies their month’s
2362,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","warning, when unexpectedly the thief was taken, as the lawyers say,"
2363,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","“in the manner,” and with the goods upon the person. In a word the"
2364,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","ungrateful black was detected, in the very act of levying what might be"
2365,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",called her “Black Mail.”
2366,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",
2367,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","The horror of Emilia, on discovering that the Moor had murdered"
2368,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","her mistress, was scarcely greater than that of Miss Morbid! She"
2369,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","hardly, she said, believed her own senses. You might have knocked"
2370,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",her down with a feather! She did not know whether she stood on her
2371,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","head or her heels. She was rooted to the spot; and her hair, if it"
2372,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","had been her own, would have stood upright upon her head! There"
2373,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",was no doubt in the case. She saw the transfer of a portion of her
2374,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","own bank stock, from her escritoire into the right-hand pocket of"
2375,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",her protégé--she heard it chink as it dropped downwards--she was
2376,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",petrified!--dumbfounded!--thunderbolted!--“annilliated!” She was as
2377,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","white as a sheet, but she felt as if all the blacks in the world had"
2378,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",just blown in her face.
2379,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",
2380,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","Her first impulse was to rush upon the robber, and insist on"
2381,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","restitution--her second was to sit down and weep,--and her third was"
2382,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",to talk. The opening as usual was a mere torrent of ejaculations
2383,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",intermixed with vituperation--but she gradually fell into a lecture
2384,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","with many heads. First, she described all that she had done for the"
2385,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","Blacks, and then, alas! all that the Blacks had done for her. Next she"
2386,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","insisted on the enormity of the crime, and, anon, she enlarged on the"
2387,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",nature of its punishment. It was here that she was most eloquent. She
2388,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","traced the course of human justice, from detection to conviction, and"
2389,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","thence to execution, liberally throwing dissection into the bargain:"
2390,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","and then descending with Dante into the unmentionable regions, she"
2391,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",painted its terrors and tortures with all the circumstantial fidelity
2392,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",that certain very Old Masters have displayed on the same subject.
2393,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",
2394,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","“And now, you black wretch,” she concluded, having just given the"
2395,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","finishing touch to a portrait of Satan himself; “and now, you black"
2396,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","wretch, I insist on knowing what I was robbed for. Come, tell me what"
2397,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","tempted you! I’m determined to hear it! I insist, I say, on knowing"
2398,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",what was to be done with the wages of iniquity!”
2399,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",
2400,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","She insisted, however, in vain. The black wretch had seriously inclined"
2401,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","her ear to the whole lecture, grinning and blubbering by turns. The"
2402,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","Judge with his black cap, the Counsel and their wigs, the twelve"
2403,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","men in a box, and Jack Ketch himself--whom she associated with that"
2404,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","pleasant West Indian personage, John Canoe--had amused, nay, tickled"
2405,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","her fancy; the press-room, the irons, the rope, and the Ordinary, whom"
2406,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","she mistook for an overseer, had raised her curiosity, and excited"
2407,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","her fears; but the spiritualities, without any reference to Obeah,"
2408,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","had simply mystified and disgusted her, and she was now in a fit of"
2409,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","the sulks. Her mistress, however, persisted in her question; and not"
2410,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","the less pertinaciously, perhaps, from expecting a new peg whereon to"
2411,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",hang a fresh lecture. She was determined to learn the destination of
2412,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","the stolen money; and by dint of insisting, cajoling, and, above all,"
2413,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","threatening--for instance, with the whole Posse Comitatis--she finally"
2414,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",carried her point.
2415,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.",
2416,"BLACK, WHITE, AND BROWN.","“Cuss him money! Here’s a fuss!” exclaimed the culprit, quite worn out"

2499,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2500,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2501,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"I once, for a very short time indeed, had the honour of being a"
2502,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"schoolmaster, and was invested with the important office of “rearing"
2503,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"the tender thought,” and “teaching the young idea how to shoot;” of"
2504,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"educating in the principles of the Established Church, and bestowing"
2505,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,the strictest attention to morals. The case was this; my young friend
2506,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"G----, a graduate of Oxford, and an ingenious and worthy man, thought"
2507,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"proper, some months back, to establish, or endeavour to establish,"
2508,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"an academy for young gentlemen, in my immediate vicinity. He had"
2509,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"already procured nine day-pupils to begin with, whom he himself"
2510,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"taught,--prudence as yet prohibiting the employment of ushers,--when"
2511,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"he was summoned hastily to attend upon a dying relative in Hampshire,"
2512,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"from whom he had some expectations. This was a dilemma to poor G----,"
2513,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,who had no one to leave in charge of his three classes; and he could
2514,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,not bear the idea of playing truant himself so soon after commencing
2515,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"business. In his extremity he applied to me as his forlorn hope, and"
2516,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,one forlorn enough; for it is well-known among my friends that I
2517,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"have little Latin, and less Greek, and am, on every account, a worse"
2518,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"accountant. I urged these objections to G----, but in vain, for he"
2519,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"had no “friend in need,” learned or unlearned, within any reasonable"
2520,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"distance, and, as he said to comfort me, “in three or four days merely"
2521,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,the boys could not _unlearn_ much of anything.”
2522,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2523,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,[Illustration: A BRANCH COACH.]
2524,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2525,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"At last I gave way to his importunity. On Thursday night, he started"
2526,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,from the tree of knowledge by a branch coach; and at nine on Friday
2527,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"morning, I found myself sitting at his desk in the novel character of"
2528,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"pedagogue. I am sorry to say, not one of the boys played truant, or"
2529,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"was confined at home with a violent illness.--There they were, nine"
2530,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"little mischievous wretches, goggling, tittering, pointing, winking,"
2531,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"grimacing, and mocking at authority, in a way enough to invoke two"
2532,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"Elisha bears out of Southgate Wood. To put a stop to this indecorum,"
2533,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"I put on my spectacles, stuck my cane upright in the desk, with the"
2534,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"fool’s-cap atop--but they inspired little terror; worn out at last,"
2535,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"I seized the cane, and rushing from my dais, well flogged--I believe"
2536,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"it is called flogging--the boy, a Creole, nearest me; who, though far"
2537,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"from the biggest, was much more daring and impertinent than the rest."
2538,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"So far my random selection was judicious; but it appeared afterwards,"
2539,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"that I had chastised an only son, whose mother had expressly stipulated"
2540,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"for him an exemption from all punishment. I suspect, with the moral"
2541,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"prudence of fond mothers, she had informed the little imp of the"
2542,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"circumstance, for this Indian-Pickle fought and kicked his preceptor"
2543,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,as unceremoniously as he would have scuffled with Black Diana or
2544,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"Agamemnon. My first move, however, had a salutary effect; the urchins"
2545,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"settled, or made believe to settle, to their tasks; but I soon"
2546,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"perceived that the genuine industry and application belonged to one,"
2547,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"a clever-looking boy, who, with pen and paper before him, was sitting"
2548,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"at the further end of a long desk, as great a contrast to the others,"
2549,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"as the Good, to the Bad Apprentice in Hogarth. I could see his tongue"
2550,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"even at work at one corner of his mouth,--a very common sign of boyish"
2551,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"assiduity,--and his eyes never left his task but occasionally to glance"
2552,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"towards his master, as if in anticipation of the approving smile,"
2553,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,to which he looked forward as the prize of industry. I had already
2554,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"selected him inwardly for a favourite, and resolved to devote my best"
2555,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"abilities to his instruction, when I saw him hand the paper, with a sly"
2556,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"glance to his neighbour, from whom it passed rapidly down the desk,"
2557,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"accompanied by a running titter, and sidelong looks, that convinced"
2558,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"me the supposed copy was, indeed, a copy not of “Obey your superiors,”"
2559,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"or “Age commands respect,” but of the head of the college, and, as a"
2560,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"glimpse showed, a head with very ludicrous features. Being somewhat"
2561,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"fatigued with my last execution, I suffered the cane of justice to"
2562,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"sleep, and inflicted the fool’s-cap--literally the fool’s--for no clown"
2563,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"in pantomime, the great Grimaldi not excepted, could have made a more"
2564,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"laughter-stirring use of the costume. The little enormities, who only"
2565,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"tittered before, now shouted outright, and nothing but the enchanted"
2566,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"wand of bamboo could flap them into solemnity. Order was restored, for"
2567,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"they saw I was, like Earl Grey, resolved to “stand by my order;” and"
2568,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"while I was deliberating, in some perplexity, how to begin business,"
2569,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"the two biggest boys came forward voluntarily, and standing as much"
2570,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"as they could in a circle, presented themselves, and began to read as"
2571,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,the first Greek class. Mr. Irving may boast of his prophets as much as
2572,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"he will; but in proportion to the numbers of our congregations, I had"
2573,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"far more reason to be proud of my gabblers in an unknown tongue. I,"
2574,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"of course, discovered no lapsus lingui in the performance, and after"
2575,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"a due course of gibberish, the first class dismissed itself, with a"
2576,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,brace of bows and an evident degree of self-satisfaction at being so
2577,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,perfect in the present after being so imperfect in the past. I own
2578,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,this first act of our solemn farce made me rather nervous against the
2579,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"next, which proved to be the Latin class, and I have no doubt to an"
2580,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,adept would have seemed as much a Latin comedy as those performed at
2581,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"the Westminster school. We got through the second course quite correct,"
2582,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"as before, and I found, with some satisfaction, that the third was a"
2583,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"dish of English Syntax, where I _was_ able to detect flaws, and the"
2584,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,heaps of errors that I had to arrest made me thoroughly sensible of the
2585,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,bliss of ignorance in the Greek and Latin. A general lesson in English
2586,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"reading ensued, through which we glided smoothly enough, till we came"
2587,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"to a sandbank in the shape of a Latin quotation, which I was requested"
2588,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,to English. It was something like this:--“Nemo mortalius omnibus hora
2589,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"sapit,” which I rendered, “No mortal knows at what hour the omnibus"
2590,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,starts”--and with this translation the whole school was perfectly
2591,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,satisfied. Nine more bows.
2592,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2593,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,[Illustration: A SECOND COURSE.]
2594,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2595,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,My horror now approached: I saw the little wretches lug out their
2596,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"slates, and begin to cuff out the old sums, a sight that made me wish"
2597,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,all the slates at the roof of the house. I knew very well that when
2598,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"the army of nine attacked my Bonnycastle, it would not long hold out."
2599,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"Unluckily, from inexperience, I gave them all the same question to"
2600,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"work, and the consequence was, each brought up a different result--nor"
2601,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,would my practical knowledge of Practice allow me to judge of their
2602,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"merits. I had no resource but, Lavater-like, to go by Physiognomy, and"
2603,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,accordingly selected the solution of the most mathematical-looking boy.
2604,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"But Lavater betrayed me. Master White, a chowder-headed lout of a lad,"
2605,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"as dull as a pig of lead, and as mulishly obstinate as Muley Abdallah,"
2606,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"persisted that his answer was correct, and at last appealed to the"
2607,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"superior authority of a Tutor’s Key, that he had kept by stealth in"
2608,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"his desk. From this instant my importance declined, and the urchins"
2609,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"evidently began to question, with some justice, what right I had to"
2610,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"rule nine, who was not competent to the Rule of Three. By way of a"
2611,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"diversion, I invited my pupils to a walk; but I wish G---- had been"
2612,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,more circumstantial in his instructions before he left. Two of the boys
2613,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"pleaded sick headaches to remain behind; and I led the rest, through"
2614,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"my arithmetical failure, under very slender government, by the most"
2615,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"unfortunate route I could have chosen,--in fact, past the very windows"
2616,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"of their parents, who complained afterwards, that they walked more like"
2617,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"bears than boys, and that if Mr. G---- had drawn lots for one at a"
2618,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"raffle, he could not have been more unfortunate in his new usher."
2619,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2620,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,[Illustration: DRAWING LOTS.]
2621,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2622,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"To avoid observation, which I did not court, I led them aside into a"
2623,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"meadow, and pulling out a volume of Paradise Lost, left the boys to"
2624,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"amuse themselves as they pleased. They pleased, accordingly, to get up"
2625,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"a little boxing match, à la Crib and Molineux--between Master White and"
2626,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"the little Creole, of which I was informed only by a final shout and"
2627,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"a stream of blood that trickled, or treacled, from the flat nose of"
2628,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"the child of colour. Luckily, as I thought, he was near home, whither"
2629,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"I sent him for washing and consolation, and in return for which, in"
2630,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"the course of a quarter of an hour, while still in the field, a black"
2631,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"footman, in powder blue turned up with yellow, brought me the following"
2632,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,note:--
2633,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2634,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"“Mrs. Col. Christopher informs Mr. G----’s Usher, that as the"
2635,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"vulgar practice of pugilism is allowed at Spring Grove Academy,"
2636,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,Master Adolphus Ferdinand Christopher will in future be educated at
2637,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,home; particularly as she understands Master C. was punished in the
2638,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"morning, in a way that only becomes blacks and slaves.--To the new"
2639,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,Usher at Mr. G----’s.”
2640,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2641,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"Irritated at this event and its commentary, I resolved to punish Master"
2642,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"White, but Master White was nowhere to be found, having expelled"
2643,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"himself and run away home, where he complained to his parents of the"
2644,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"new usher’s deficiencies, and told the whole story of the sum in"
2645,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"Practice, begging earnestly to be removed from a school where, as he"
2646,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"said, it was impossible for him to improve himself. The prayer of"
2647,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"the petition was heard, and on the morrow, Mr. White’s son was minus"
2648,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"at Spring Grove Academy. Calling in the remainder, I ordered a march"
2649,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"homewards, where I arrived just in time to hear the sham headaches of"
2650,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,the two invalids go off with an alarming explosion--for they had thus
2651,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,concerted an opportunity for playing with gunpowder and prohibited
2652,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"arms. Here was another discharge from the school, for no parents think"
2653,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"that their children look the better without eyebrows, and accordingly,"
2654,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"when they went home for the night, the fathers and mothers resolved to"
2655,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"send them to some other school, where no powder was allowed, except"
2656,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,upon the head of the master. I was too much hurt to resume schooling
2657,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"after the boys’ bad behaviour, and so gave them a half-holiday; and"
2658,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"never, oh never did I so estimate the blessing of sleep, as on that"
2659,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"night when I closed my eyelids on all my pupils! But, alas! sleep"
2660,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"brought its sorrows:--I saw boys fighting, flourishing slates, and"
2661,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"brandishing squibs and crackers in my visions; and through all,--such"
2662,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"is the transparency of dreams,--I beheld the stern shadow of G----"
2663,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,looking unutterable reproaches.
2664,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2665,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,[Illustration: “COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE.”]
2666,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,
2667,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"The next morning, with many painful recollections, brought one of"
2668,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"pleasure; I remembered that it was the King’s Birthday, and in a fit"
2669,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"of very sincere loyalty, gave the whole school, alas! reduced by one"
2670,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"half, a whole holiday. Thus I got over the end of the week, and Sunday,"
2671,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"literally a day of rest, was spent by the urchins at their own homes."
2672,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"It may seem sinful to wish for the death of a fellow-creature, but"
2673,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,I could not help thinking of G----’s relative along with what is
2674,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"called a happy release; and he really was so kind, as we learned by"
2675,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"an express from G----, as to break up just after his arrival, and"
2676,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,that G---- consequently would return in time to resume his scholastic
2677,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,duties on the Monday morning. With infinite pleasure I heard this good
2678,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"bad news from Mrs. G----, who never interfered in the classical part"
2679,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"of the house, and was consequently all unconscious of the reduction"
2680,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,in the Spring Grove Establishment. I forged an excuse for immediately
2681,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"leaving off school; “resigned I kissed the rod” that I resigned, and"
2682,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"as I departed, no master but my own, was overwhelmed by a torrent of"
2683,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"grateful acknowledgments of the service I had done the school, which,"
2684,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"as Mrs. G---- protested, could never have got on without me. How it"
2685,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"got on I left G---- to discover, and I am told he behaved rather like"
2686,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"Macduff at the loss of his “little ones”--but luckily, I had given"
2687,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"myself warning before his arrival, and escaped from one porch of the"
2688,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,Academy at that nick of time when the Archodidasculus was entering by
2689,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,"another, perfectly convinced that, however adapted to “live and learn,”"
2690,THE SCHOOLMASTER ABROAD.,I should never be able to live and teach.

2911,THE OBSERVER.,"a smart cut on the wheeler; “I belong to an association too, and we’ve"
2912,THE OBSERVER.,"none of us seen it. There’s a hundred members, and I’ve enquired of"
2913,THE OBSERVER.,"every man of ’em, for it’s my remark. But some people see a deal more"
2914,THE OBSERVER.,than their fellows. Mayhap you’ve seen the other thing I’ve observed
2915,THE OBSERVER.,"through life, and that’s this--I’ve never observed a black man drive a"
2916,THE OBSERVER.,long stage.”
2917,THE OBSERVER.,
2918,THE OBSERVER.,"“Never, Bat,” said I, desiring to conciliate him, “never in the whole"
2919,THE OBSERVER.,course of my stage practice; and for many years of my life I was a
2920,THE OBSERVER.,daily visitant to Richmond.”
2921,THE OBSERVER.,
2922,THE OBSERVER.,"“And no one else has ever seen it,” said Bat. “That’s a correct remark,"
2923,THE OBSERVER.,"anyhow. As for Richmond, he never drove a team in his life, for I asked"
2924,THE OBSERVER.,"him the question myself, just after his fight with Shelton.”"

2929,THE CONTRAST.,"“I hope the Leviathan is outward-bound,” I ejaculated, half aloud, as"
2930,THE CONTRAST.,I beheld the Kit-Kat portion of the Man-Mountain occupying the whole
2931,THE CONTRAST.,frame of the coach-window. But Hope deceived as usual; and in he came.
2932,THE CONTRAST.,
2933,THE CONTRAST.,"I ought rather to have said he essayed to come in,--for it was only"
2934,THE CONTRAST.,"after repeated experiments upon material substances, that he contrived"
2935,THE CONTRAST.,"to enter the vehicle edgeways,--if such blunt bodies may be said to"
2936,THE CONTRAST.,"have an edge at all. As I contemplated his bulk, I could not help"
2937,THE CONTRAST.,"thinking of the mighty Lambert, and was ready to exclaim with Gratiano,"
2938,THE CONTRAST.,“A Daniel! a second Daniel!”
2939,THE CONTRAST.,
2940,THE CONTRAST.,"The Brobdignaggian had barely subsided in his seat, when the opposite"
2941,THE CONTRAST.,"door opened, and in stepped a Liliputian! The conjunction was"
2942,THE CONTRAST.,"whimsical. Yonder, thought I, is the Irish Giant, and the other is the"
2943,THE CONTRAST.,"dwarf, Count Borulawski. This coach is their travelling caravan--and"
2944,THE CONTRAST.,"as for myself, I am no doubt the showman."
2945,THE CONTRAST.,
2946,THE CONTRAST.,"I was amusing myself with this and kindred fancies, when a hand"
2947,THE CONTRAST.,"suddenly held up something, at the coach window. “It’s my luggage,”"
2948,THE CONTRAST.,"said the Giant, with a small penny-trumpet of a pipe, and taking"
2949,THE CONTRAST.,possession of a mere golden pippin of a bundle.
2950,THE CONTRAST.,
2951,THE CONTRAST.,"“The three large trunks and the biggest carpet-bag are _my_ property,”"

2958,THE CONTRAST.,"“Prodigious preponderance of caloric in the atmosphere,” thundered the"
2959,THE CONTRAST.,"Dwarf, by way of big talk."
2960,THE CONTRAST.,
2961,THE CONTRAST.,"“Have you paid your fare, gentlemen?” asked the coachman, looking in at"

2963,THE CONTRAST.,
2964,THE CONTRAST.,"“I have paid half of mine,” said the Stupendous, “and it’s booked. My"

2966,THE CONTRAST.,
2967,THE CONTRAST.,"“Mine is Heavyside,” said the Pigmy, “and I have disbursed the sum"

2969,THE CONTRAST.,
2970,THE CONTRAST.,"The door slammed--the whip cracked--sixteen horse-shoes made a clatter,"
2971,THE CONTRAST.,and away bowled the New Safety; but had barely rolled two hundred
2972,THE CONTRAST.,"yards, when it gave an alarming bound over some loose paving stones,"
2973,THE CONTRAST.,"followed by a very critical swing. The Dwarf, in a tone louder than"
2974,THE CONTRAST.,"ever, gave vent to a prodigious oath; the Giant said, “Dear me!”"
2975,THE CONTRAST.,
2976,THE CONTRAST.,"There will something come of this, said I to myself; so, feigning"
2977,THE CONTRAST.,"I sleep, I leaned back in a corner, with a wary ear to their"
2978,THE CONTRAST.,conversation. The Gog had been that morning to the Exhibition of
2979,THE CONTRAST.,"Fleas, in Regent Street, and thought them “prodigious!” The Runtling"
2980,THE CONTRAST.,"had visited the Great Whale at Charing-Cross, and “thought little of"
2981,THE CONTRAST.,it.” The Goliath spoke with wonder of the “vast extent of view from
2982,THE CONTRAST.,the top of the Monument.” The David was “disappointed by the prospect
2983,THE CONTRAST.,from Plinlimmon.” The Hurlothrumbo was “amazed by the grandeur of St.
2984,THE CONTRAST.,Paul’s.” The Tom Thumb spoke slightingly of St. Peter’s at Rome. In
2985,THE CONTRAST.,theatricals their taste held the same mathematical proportion. Gog
2986,THE CONTRAST.,“must say he liked the Minors best.” The “Wee Thing” declared for the
2987,THE CONTRAST.,Majors. The Man-Mountain’s favourite was Miss _Foote_ = twelve inches.
2988,THE CONTRAST.,The Manikin preferred Miss _Cubitt_ = eighteen.
2989,THE CONTRAST.,
2990,THE CONTRAST.,"The conversation, and the contrast, flourished in full flower through"

2994,THE CONTRAST.,The Folio took a chair at the ordinary--

3045,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,The very horses knew his weight
3046,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"When he was in the rear,"
3047,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,And wished his box a Christmas-box

3050,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,Alas! against the shafts of love

3054,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3055,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"The bar-maid of the Crown he loved,"
3056,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"From whom he never ranged,"
3057,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"For tho’ he changed his horses there,"
3058,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,His love he never changed.
3059,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3060,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"He thought her fairest of all fares,"
3061,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,So fondly love prefers;
3062,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"And often, among twelve outsides,"
3063,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,Deemed no outside like hers.
3064,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3065,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,One day as she was sitting down
3066,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,Beside the porter-pump--
3067,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"He came, and knelt with all his fat,"
3068,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,And made an offer plump.
3069,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3070,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Said she, my taste will never learn"
3071,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"To like so huge a man,"
3072,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,So I must beg you will come here
3073,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,As little as you can.
3074,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3075,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"But still be stoutly urged his suit,"
3076,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"With vows, and sighs, and tears,"
3077,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Yet could not pierce her heart, altho’"
3078,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,He drove the Dart for years.
3079,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3080,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"In vain he wooed, in vain he sued;"
3081,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"The maid was cold and proud,"
3082,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"And sent him off to Coventry,"

3084,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3085,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"He fretted all the way to Stroud,"
3086,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,And thence all back to town;
3087,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"The course of love was never smooth,"
3088,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,So his went up and down.
3089,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3090,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,At last her coldness made him pine
3091,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,To merely bones and skin;
3092,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,But still he loved like one resolved
3093,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,To love through thick and thin.
3094,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3095,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Oh, Mary, view my wasted back,"

3099,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3100,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Alas, in vain he still assailed,"
3101,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,Her heart withstood the dint;

3104,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3105,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,"Worn out, at last he made a vow"

3108,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,At nothing he could shrink.
3109,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,
3110,A PATHETIC BALLAD.,Now some will talk in water’s praise

3145,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,Nothing private is yet made public; but report speaks of very serious

3158,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"threaten and disturb your old birth-place, poor Stoke Pogis. To the"
3159,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"reflecting mind, the circumstances which hourly transpire afford ample"
3160,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,food for speculation and moral reasoning. To see the constituted
3161,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"authorities of a place, however mistaken or misguided by erring"
3162,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"benevolence, plunging into a fearful struggle with an irritated,"
3163,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"infuriated, and I may say, armed populace, is a sight which opens a"
3164,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"field for terrified conjecture. I look around me with doubt, agitation,"
3165,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"and dismay; because, whilst I venerate those to whom the sway of a"
3166,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"part of a state may be said to be intrusted, I cannot but yield to"
3167,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,the conviction that the abuse of power must be felt to be an overstep
3168,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,of authority in the best intentioned of the Magistracy. This even you
3169,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"will allow. Being on the spot, my dear Charles, an eye-witness of"
3170,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"these fearful scenes, I feel how impossible it is for me to give you"
3171,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,any idea of the prospects which surround me. To say that I think all
3172,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"will end well, is to trespass beyond the confines of hope; but whilst"
3173,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"I admit that there is strong ground for apprehending the worst, I"
3174,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"cannot shut my eyes to the conviction, that if firm measures, tempered"
3175,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"with concession, be resorted to, it is far from being out of the pale"
3176,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,of probability that serenity may be re-established. In hazarding this
3177,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"conclusion, however, you must not consider me as at all forgetting"
3178,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"the responsibilities which attach to a decidedly formed opinion. Oh,"
3179,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"Charles! you who are in the quiet of London, can little dream of the"
3180,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,conflicting elements which form the storm of this devoted village. I
3181,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,fear you will be wearied with all these details; but I thought at this
3182,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,"distance, at which you are from me, you would wish me to run the risk"
3183,THE PARISH REVOLUTION.,of wearying you rather than omit any of the interesting circumstances.

3193,H. J. P.,_Another Account._
3194,H. J. P.,
3195,H. J. P.,Symptoms of disunion have for some time past prevailed between the
3196,H. J. P.,"authorities of Stoke Pogis, and a part of the inhabitants. The primum"
3197,H. J. P.,"mobile or first mobbing, originated in an order of the Mayor’s, that"
3198,H. J. P.,"all tavern doors should shut at eleven. Many complied, and shut,"
3199,H. J. P.,but the door of the Rampant Lion openly resisted the order. A more
3200,H. J. P.,recent notice has produced a new and more dangerous irritation on our
3201,H. J. P.,too combustible population. A proclamation against Guy Fauxes and
3202,H. J. P.,"Fireworks was understood to be in preparation, by command of the chief"
3203,H. J. P.,Magistrate. If his Worship had listened to the earnest and prudential
3204,H. J. P.,"advice of the rest of the bench, the obnoxious placard would not have"
3205,H. J. P.,"been issued till the 6th, but he had it posted up on the 4th, and by"
3206,H. J. P.,"his precipitation has plunged Stoke Pogis into a convulsion, that"
3207,H. J. P.,nothing but Time’s soothing syrup can alleviate.
3208,H. J. P.,
3209,H. J. P.,_From another quarter._
3210,H. J. P.,
3211,H. J. P.,We are all here in the greatest alarm! a general rising of the
3212,H. J. P.,"inhabitants took place this morning, and they have continued in a"
3213,H. J. P.,disturbed state ever since. Everybody is in a bustle and indicating
3214,H. J. P.,some popular movement. Seditious cries are heard! the bell-man is going
3215,H. J. P.,"his rounds, and on repeating “God save the King!” is saluted with"
3216,H. J. P.,“Hang the crier!” Organised bands of boys are going about collecting
3217,H. J. P.,"sticks, &c., whether for barricades or bonfires is not known; many of"
3218,H. J. P.,"them singing the famous Gunpowder Hymn, “Pray remember,” &c. These"
3219,H. J. P.,are features that remind us of the most inflammable times. Several
3220,H. J. P.,"strangers of suspicious gentility arrived here last night, and"
3221,H. J. P.,privately engaged a barn; they are now busily distributing hand-bills
3222,H. J. P.,amongst the crowd: surely some horrible tragedy is in preparation!
3223,H. J. P.,
3224,H. J. P.,_A later account._
3225,H. J. P.,
3226,H. J. P.,"The alarm increases. Several families have taken flight by the waggon,"
3227,H. J. P.,"and the office of Mr. Stewart, the overseer, is besieged by persons"
3228,H. J. P.,desirous of being passed to their own parish. He seems embarrassed
3229,H. J. P.,"and irresolute, and returns evasive answers. The worst fears are"
3230,H. J. P.,entertaining.

3233,H. J. P.,
3234,H. J. P.,The cause of the overseer’s hesitation has transpired. The pass-cart
3235,H. J. P.,"and horse have been lent to a tradesman, for a day’s pleasure, and"
3236,H. J. P.,are not returned. Nothing can exceed the indignation of the paupers!
3237,H. J. P.,"they are all pouring towards the poor-house headed by Timothy Gubbins,"
3238,H. J. P.,"a desperate drunken character, but the idol of the Workhouse. The"
3239,H. J. P.,constables are retiring before this formidable body. The following
3240,H. J. P.,notice is said to be posted up at the Town-hall: “Stick No Bills.”

3243,H. J. P.,
3244,H. J. P.,The mob have proceeded to outrage--the poor poor-house has not a
3245,H. J. P.,"whole pane of glass in its whole frame! The Magistrates, with Mr."
3246,H. J. P.,"Higginbottom at their head, have agreed to call out the military; and"
3247,H. J. P.,he has sent word that he will come as soon as he has put on his uniform.
3248,H. J. P.,
3249,H. J. P.,"A terrific column of little boys has just run down the High-street,"
3250,H. J. P.,it is said to see a fight at the Green Dragon. There is an immense
3251,H. J. P.,crowd in the Market-Place. Some of the leading shopkeepers have had a
3252,H. J. P.,"conference with the Mayor, and the people are now being informed by a"
3253,H. J. P.,placard of the result. Gracious Heaven! how opposite is it to the hopes
3254,H. J. P.,of all moderate men--“The Mare is Hobstinate--He is at the Roes and
3255,H. J. P.,Crown--But refuses to treat.”

3259,H. J. P.,"The military has arrived, and is placed under his own command. He has"
3260,H. J. P.,"marched himself in a body to the market-place, and is now drawn up one"
3261,H. J. P.,"deep in front of the Pound. The mob are in possession of the walls, and"
3262,H. J. P.,have chalked upon them the following proclamation; “Stokian Pogians be
3263,H. J. P.,firm! stick up for bonfires! stand to your squibs!”

3274,H. J. P.,will concede nothing. When the excitement of the mob was represented to
3275,H. J. P.,"him by Mr. Wigsby, he pointed to a truncheon on a table and answered,"
3276,H. J. P.,“They may do their worsest.” The exasperation is awful--the most
3277,H. J. P.,"frightful cries are uttered, “Huzza for Guys! Gubbins for ever! and"
3278,H. J. P.,"no Higginbottom!” The military has been ordered to clear the streets,"
3279,H. J. P.,"but his lock is not flinty enough, and his gun refuses to fire on the"
3280,H. J. P.,people.

3283,H. J. P.,
3284,H. J. P.,The constables have just obtained a slight advantage; they made a
3285,H. J. P.,"charge altogether, and almost upset a Guy. On the left-hand side of the"
3286,H. J. P.,"way they have been less successful; Mr. Huggins, the beadle, attempted"
3287,H. J. P.,"to take possession of an important street post, but was repulsed by a"
3288,H. J. P.,"boy with a cracker. At the same moment Mr. Blogg, the churchwarden, was"
3289,H. J. P.,defeated in a desperate attempt to force a _passage_ up a _court_.

3293,H. J. P.,"The military always dines at one, and has retreated to the Pig and"
3294,H. J. P.,Puncheon. There is a report that the head constable is taken with all
3295,H. J. P.,his staff.

3298,H. J. P.,
3299,H. J. P.,A flying watchman has just informed us that the police are victorious
3300,H. J. P.,"on all points, and the same has been confirmed by a retreating"
3301,H. J. P.,"constable. He states that the Pound is full--Gubbins in the stocks, and"
3302,H. J. P.,"Dobbs in the cage. That the whole mob would have been routed, but for a"
3303,H. J. P.,"very corpulent man, who rallied them on running away."

3309,H. J. P.,"The check sustained by the mob proves to have been a reverse, the"
3310,H. J. P.,"constables are the sufferers. The cage is chopped to faggots, we"
3311,H. J. P.,"haven’t a pound, and the stocks are rapidly falling. Mr. Wigsby has"
3312,H. J. P.,"gone again to the Mayor with overtures, the people demand the release"
3313,H. J. P.,"of Dobbs and Gubbins, and the demolition of the stocks, the pound, and"
3314,H. J. P.,"the cage. As these are already destroyed, and Gubbins and Dobbs are at"
3315,H. J. P.,"large, it is confidently hoped by all moderate men, that his Worship"
3316,H. J. P.,will accede to the terms.

3318,H. J. P.,Four o’clock.
3319,H. J. P.,
3320,H. J. P.,The Mayor has rejected the terms. It is confidently affirmed that after
3321,H. J. P.,"this decision, he secretly ordered a post-chaise, and has set off with"
3322,H. J. P.,a pair of post horses as fast as they can gallop. A meeting of the
3323,H. J. P.,"principal tradesmen has taken place, and the butcher, the baker, the"
3324,H. J. P.,"grocer, the cheesemonger, and the publican, have agreed to compose a"
3325,H. J. P.,Provisional Government. In the mean time the mob are loud in their
3326,H. J. P.,"joy,--they are letting off squibs and crackers, and rockets, and devils"
3327,H. J. P.,"in all directions, and quiet is completely restored."

3516,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"In the autumn of 1825, some private affairs called me into the sister"
3517,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"kingdom; and as I did not travel, like Polyphemus, with my eye out,"
3518,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"I gathered a few samples of Irish character, amongst which was the"
3519,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,following incident.
3520,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3521,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"I was standing one morning at the window of “mine Inn,” when my"
3522,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,attention was attracted by a scene that took place beneath. The
3523,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"Belfast coach was standing at the door, and on the roof, in front, sat"
3524,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"a solitary outside passenger, a fine young fellow in the uniform of"
3525,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"the Connaught Rangers. Below, by the front wheel, stood an old woman,"
3526,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"seemingly his mother, a young man, and a younger woman, sister or"
3527,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,sweetheart; and they were all earnestly entreating the young soldier to
3528,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,descend from his seat on the coach.
3529,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3530,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“Come down wid ye, Thady,”--the speaker was the old woman--“come down"
3531,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"now to your ould mother. Sure it’s flog ye they will, and strip the"
3532,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"flesh off the bones I give ye. Come down, Thady, darlin!”"
3533,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3534,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“It’s honour, mother,” was the short reply of the soldier; and with"
3535,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,clenched hands and set teeth he took a stiffer posture on the coach.
3536,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3537,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“Thady, come down--come down, ye fool of the world--come along down wid"
3538,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,ye!” The tone of the present appeal was more impatient and peremptory
3539,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,than the last; and the answer was more promptly and sternly pronounced:
3540,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“It’s honour, brother!” and the body of the speaker rose more rigidly"
3541,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,erect than ever on the roof.
3542,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3543,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“Oh Thady, come down; sure it’s me, your own Kathleen, that bids ye."
3544,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"Come down, or ye’ll break the heart of me, Thady, jewel; come down"
3545,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"then!” The poor girl wrung her hands as she said it, and cast a look"
3546,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"upward, that had a visible effect on the muscles of the soldier’s"
3547,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"countenance. There was more tenderness in his tone, but it conveyed the"
3548,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,same resolution as before.
3549,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3550,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“It’s honour, honour bright, Kathleen!” and as if to defend himself"
3551,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"from another glance, he fixed his look steadfastly in front, while the"
3552,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"renewed entreaties burst from all the three in chorus, with the same"
3553,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,answer.
3554,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3555,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“Come down, Thady, honey!--Thady, ye fool, come down!--Oh Thady, come"
3556,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,down to me!”
3557,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3558,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“It’s honour, mother!--It’s honour, brother!--Honour bright, my own"
3559,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,Kathleen!”
3560,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3561,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"Although the poor fellow was a private, this appeal was so public, that"
3562,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,I did not hesitate to go down and enquire into the particulars of the
3563,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"distress. It appeared that he had been home, on Furlough, to visit his"
3564,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"family,--and having exceeded as he thought the term of his leave, he"
3565,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"was going to rejoin his regiment, and to undergo the penalty of his"
3566,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,neglect. I asked him when the Furlough expired.
3567,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3568,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“The First of March, your honour--bad luck to it of all the black days"
3569,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"in the world,--and here it is come sudden on me like a shot!”"
3570,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3571,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"“The first of March!--why, my good fellow, you have a day to spare"
3572,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"then,--the first of March will not be here till to-morrow. It is Leap"
3573,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"Year, and February has twenty-nine days.”"
3574,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3575,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"The soldier was thunderstruck.--“Twenty-nine days, is it--You’re sartin"
3576,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"of that same!--Oh, Mother, Mother!--the Divil fly away wid yere ould"
3577,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"Almanack--a base cratur of a book, to be deceaven one, afther living so"

3579,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,
3580,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"His first impulse was to cut a caper on the roof of the coach, and"
3581,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"throw up his cap, with a loud Hurrah!--His second was to throw himself"
3582,AN IRISH ANECDOTE.,"into the arms of his Kathleen, and the third, was to wring my hand off"

3703,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Amongst the sights that Mrs. Bond
3704,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Enjoyed, yet grieved at more than others--"
3705,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Were little ducklings in the pond,"
3706,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Swimming about beside their mothers--
3707,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Small things like living water lilies,"
3708,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,But yellow as the daffo-_dillies_.
3709,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3710,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"“It’s very hard,” she used to moan,"
3711,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,“That other people have their ducklings
3712,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,To grace their waters--mine alone

3714,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,For why!--each little yellow navy
3715,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Went down--all downy--to old Davy!
3716,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3717,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,She had a lake--a pond I mean--
3718,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Its wave was rather thick than pearly--
3719,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"She had two ducks, their napes were green--"
3720,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"She had a drake, his tail was curly,--"
3721,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Yet spite of drake, and ducks, and pond,"
3722,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,No little ducks had Mrs. Bond!
3723,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3724,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,The birds were both the best of mothers--
3725,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,The nests had eggs--the eggs had luck--
3726,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,The infant D.’s came forth like others--

3728,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"They might as well have all died addle,"
3729,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,As die when they began to paddle!
3730,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3731,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"For when, as native instinct taught her,"
3732,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"The mother set her brood afloat,"
3733,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"They sank ere long right under water,"
3734,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Like any overloaded boat;
3735,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"They were web-footed too to see,"
3736,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,As ducks and spiders ought to be!
3737,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3738,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,No peccant humour in a gander
3739,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Brought havoc on her little folks,--"

3742,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Beneath her very eyes, Od’ rot ’em!"
3743,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,They went like plummets to the bottom.
3744,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3745,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,The thing was strange--a contradiction
3746,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,It seemed of nature and her works!
3747,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"For little ducks, beyond conviction,"
3748,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Should float without the help of corks:
3749,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Great Johnson it bewildered him!
3750,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,To hear of ducks that could not swim.
3751,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3752,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Poor Mrs. Bond! what could she do
3753,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"But change the breed--and she tried divers,"
3754,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Which dived as all seemed born to do;
3755,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,No little ones were e’er survivors--
3756,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Like those that copy gems, I’m thinking,"
3757,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,They all were given to die-sinking!
3758,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3759,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,In vain their downy coats were shorn:
3760,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"They floundered still,--Batch after batch went!"
3761,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,The little fools seemed only born
3762,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,And hatched for nothing but a hatchment!
3763,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Whene’er they launched--oh sight of wonder!
3764,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Like fires the water “got them under!”
3765,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3766,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,No woman ever gave their lucks
3767,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,A better chance than Mrs. Bond did;
3768,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"At last quite out of heart and ducks,"
3769,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,She gave her pond up and desponded;
3770,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"For Death among the water lilies,"
3771,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Cried “_Duc_ ad me,” to all her dillies."
3772,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3773,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"But though resolved to breed no more,"
3774,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,She brooded often on this riddle--
3775,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Alas! twas darker than before!
3776,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"At last, about the summer’s middle,"
3777,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"What Johnson, Mrs. Bond, or none did,"
3778,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,To clear the matter up the sun did!
3779,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3780,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"The thirsty Sirius, dog-like, drank"
3781,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"So deep his furious tongue to cool,"
3782,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"The shallow waters sank and sank,"
3783,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"And lo, from out the wasted pool,"
3784,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Too hot to hold them any longer,"
3785,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,There crawled some eels as big as conger!
3786,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3787,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"I wish all folks would look a bit,"
3788,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,In such a case below the surface;
3789,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,But when the eels were caught and split
3790,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"By Mrs. Bond, just think of _her_ face,"
3791,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,In each inside at once to spy
3792,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,A ducking turned to giblet pie!
3793,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,
3794,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,The sight at once explained the case.
3795,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Making the Dame look rather silly,"
3796,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,The tenants of that _Eely Place_
3797,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"Had found the way to _Pick a dilly_,"
3798,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,"And so by under-water suction,"
3799,THE DROWNING DUCKS.,Had wrought the little ducks’ abduction.

3994,A HORSE-DEALER,
3995,A HORSE-DEALER,
3996,A HORSE-DEALER,"Is a double dealer, for he dealeth more in double meanings than your"
3997,A HORSE-DEALER,"punster. When he giveth his word it signifieth little, howbeit it"
3998,A HORSE-DEALER,standeth for two significations. He putteth his promises like his
3999,A HORSE-DEALER,"colts in a break. Over his mouth, Truth, like the turnpike man, writeth"
4000,A HORSE-DEALER,"up No Trust. Whenever he speaketh, his spoke hath more turns than the"
4001,A HORSE-DEALER,"fore-wheel. He telleth lies, not white only, or black, but likewise"
4002,A HORSE-DEALER,"gray, bay, chestnut-brown, cream, and roan--piebald and skewbald. He"
4003,A HORSE-DEALER,"sweareth as many oaths out of court as any man, and more in; for he"
4004,A HORSE-DEALER,"will swear two ways about a horse’s dam. If, by God’s grace, he be"
4005,A HORSE-DEALER,"something honest, it is only a dapple, for he can be fair and unfair"
4006,A HORSE-DEALER,"at once. He hath much imagination, for he selleth a complete set of"
4007,A HORSE-DEALER,"capital harness, of which there be no traces. He advertiseth a coach,"
4008,A HORSE-DEALER,"warranted on its first wheels, and truly the hind pair are wanting to"
4009,A HORSE-DEALER,"the bargain. A carriage that hath travelled twenty summers and winters,"
4010,A HORSE-DEALER,he describeth well-seasoned. He knocketh down machine horses that
4011,A HORSE-DEALER,"have been knocked up on the road, but is so tender of heart to his"
4012,A HORSE-DEALER,"animals that he parteth with none for a fault; “for,” as he sayeth,"
4013,A HORSE-DEALER,"“blindness or lameness be misfortunes.” A nag, proper only for dog’s"
4014,A HORSE-DEALER,"meat, he writeth down, but crieth up, “fit to go to any hounds;” or,"
4015,A HORSE-DEALER,"as may be, “would suit a timid gentleman.” String-halt he calleth"
4016,A HORSE-DEALER,"“grand action,” and kicking, “lifting the feet well up.” If a mare"
4017,A HORSE-DEALER,"have the farcical disease, he nameth her “out of Comedy,” and selleth"
4018,A HORSE-DEALER,Blackbird for a racer because he hath a running thrush. Horses that
4019,A HORSE-DEALER,"drink only water, he justly warranteth to be “temperate,” and if dead"
4020,A HORSE-DEALER,"lame, declareth them “good in all their paces,” seeing that they can"
4021,A HORSE-DEALER,"go but one. Roaring he calleth “sound,” and a steed that high bloweth"
4022,A HORSE-DEALER,"in running, he compareth to Eclipse, for he oustrippeth the wind."
4023,A HORSE-DEALER,"Another might be entered at a steeplechase, for why--he is as fast as"
4024,A HORSE-DEALER,a church. Thoroughpin with him is synonymous with “perfect leg.” If a
4025,A HORSE-DEALER,"nag cougheth, ’tis “a clever hack.” If his knees be fractured, he is"
4026,A HORSE-DEALER,"“well broke for gig or saddle.” If he reareth, he is “above sixteen"
4027,A HORSE-DEALER,hands high.” If he hath drawn a tierce in a cart he is a good fencer.
4028,A HORSE-DEALER,"If he biteth, he shows good courage; and he is playful merely, though"
4029,A HORSE-DEALER,"he should play the devil. If he runneth away, he calleth him “off the"
4030,A HORSE-DEALER,"Gretna Road, and has been used to carry a lady.” If a cob stumbleth, he"
4031,A HORSE-DEALER,"considereth him a true goer, and addeth “The proprietor parteth from"
4032,A HORSE-DEALER,"him to go abroad.” Thus, without much profession of religion, yet is"
4033,A HORSE-DEALER,"he truly Christian-like in practice, for he dealeth not in detraction,"
4034,A HORSE-DEALER,"and would not disparage the character even of a brute. Like unto Love,"
4035,A HORSE-DEALER,"he is blind unto all blemishes, and seeth only a virtue, meanwhile he"
4036,A HORSE-DEALER,"gazeth at a vice. He taketh the kick of a nag’s hoof like a love token,"
4037,A HORSE-DEALER,"saying only, before standers-by, “Poor fellow,--he knoweth me!”--and"
4038,A HORSE-DEALER,"is content rather to pass as a bad rider, than that the horse should"
4039,A HORSE-DEALER,he held restive or over-mettlesome which discharges him from its back.
4040,A HORSE-DEALER,"If it hath bitten him beside, and moreover bruised his limb against a"
4041,A HORSE-DEALER,"coach-wheel, then, constantly returning good for evil, he giveth it but"
4042,A HORSE-DEALER,"the better character, and recommendeth it before all the studs in his"
4043,A HORSE-DEALER,"stable. In short, the worse a horse may be, the more he chanteth his"
4044,A HORSE-DEALER,"praise, like a crow that croweth over Old Ball, whose lot it is on a"
4045,A HORSE-DEALER,common to meet with the Common Lot.

4111,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Those who have peeped into the portfolios of Mr. Geoffrey Crayon,"
4112,THE ILLUMINATI.,will easily remember his graphic sketches of a locality called Little
4113,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Britain--and his amusing portraits of its two leading families,"
4114,THE ILLUMINATI.,the Lambs and the Trotters. I imagine the deserved popularity of
4115,THE ILLUMINATI.,"the draughtsman made him much in request at routs, soirées, and"
4116,THE ILLUMINATI.,"conversazioni, or so acute an observer would not have failed to notice"
4117,THE ILLUMINATI.,"a nocturnal characteristic of the same neighbourhood,--I mean the"
4118,THE ILLUMINATI.,frequent and alarming glares of light that illuminate its firmament;
4119,THE ILLUMINATI.,"but in spite of which, no parish engine rumbles down the steps of"
4120,THE ILLUMINATI.,"St. Botolph, the fire-ladders hang undisturbed in their chains, and"
4121,THE ILLUMINATI.,the turn-cock smokes placidly in the tap-room of the Rose-and-Crown.
4122,THE ILLUMINATI.,"For this remarkable apathy, my own more domestic habits enable me to"
4123,THE ILLUMINATI.,account.
4124,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4125,THE ILLUMINATI.,"It is the fortune, or misfortune, of the house where I lodge to"
4126,THE ILLUMINATI.,"confront that of Mr. Wix, “Wax and Tallow Chandler to his Majesty;” and"
4127,THE ILLUMINATI.,certainly no individual ever burned so much to evince his loyalty. He
4128,THE ILLUMINATI.,and his windows are always framing an excuse for an illumination.
4129,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4130,THE ILLUMINATI.,"The kindling aptitude ascribed to Eupyrions, and Lucifers, and Chlorate"
4131,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Matches, is nothing to his. Contrary to Hoyle’s rules for loo,--a"
4132,THE ILLUMINATI.,single court card is sufficient with him for “a blaze.” He knows and
4133,THE ILLUMINATI.,"keeps the birthdays of all royal personages, and shows by tallow"
4134,THE ILLUMINATI.,in tins how they wax in years. As sure as the Park guns go off in
4135,THE ILLUMINATI.,"the morning, he fires his six-pounders in the evening; as sure as a"
4136,THE ILLUMINATI.,"newsman’s horn is sounded in the street, it blows the same spark into"
4137,THE ILLUMINATI.,"a flame.--In some cases his inflammability was such, he has been known"
4138,THE ILLUMINATI.,"to ignite, and exhibit fire, where he should have shed water. He was"
4139,THE ILLUMINATI.,once--it is still a local joke--within an ace of rejoicing at Marr’s
4140,THE ILLUMINATI.,Murder.
4141,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4142,THE ILLUMINATI.,"During the long War he was really a nuisance, and what is worse, not"
4143,THE ILLUMINATI.,"indictable. For one not unused to the melting mood, he was strangely"
4144,THE ILLUMINATI.,given to rejoicing. Other people were content to light up for the great
4145,THE ILLUMINATI.,"victories, but he commemorated the slightest skirmishes. In civil"
4146,THE ILLUMINATI.,"events the same, whether favourable to Whig or Tory. Like the lover"
4147,THE ILLUMINATI.,"of Bessy Bell, and Mary Gray, he divided his flame between them.--He"
4148,THE ILLUMINATI.,"lighted when the administration of the Duke of Wellington came in, and"
4149,THE ILLUMINATI.,"he lighted when it went out,--in short, it seemed, as with the Roman"
4150,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Catholics, that candle-burning was a part of his religion, and that he"
4151,THE ILLUMINATI.,had got his religion itself from an illuminated missal.
4152,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4153,THE ILLUMINATI.,"To aggravate this propensity, Mr. Sperm, the great oil merchant, lives"
4154,THE ILLUMINATI.,"nearly opposite to Mr. Wix, and his principle and his interest coincide"
4155,THE ILLUMINATI.,exactly with those of his neighbour. Mr. Sperm possesses a very large
4156,THE ILLUMINATI.,"star,--and, like certain managers, he brings it forward as often as he"
4157,THE ILLUMINATI.,"can. He is quite as lax in his political creed as the chandler, and"
4158,THE ILLUMINATI.,"will light up on the lightest occasions,--for instance, let there be"
4159,THE ILLUMINATI.,"but a peal of bells, and the Genius of the Ring directly invokes the"
4160,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Genius of the Lamp. In short, Mr. Wix and Mr. Sperm both resemble the"
4161,THE ILLUMINATI.,same thing--a merchant-man getting rid of goods by means of lighters.
4162,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4163,THE ILLUMINATI.,As the other inhabitants do not always choose to follow the example of
4164,THE ILLUMINATI.,these two--I have known our illuminations to be very select--the great
4165,THE ILLUMINATI.,oil and tallow establishments blazing all alone in their glory. On
4166,THE ILLUMINATI.,"other occasions--for instance, the rejoicings for that bill which Lord"
4167,THE ILLUMINATI.,L. calls a Bill of Panes and Penalties--I have seen our street assume
4168,THE ILLUMINATI.,"the motley appearance of a chessboard, alternately dark and bright--to"
4169,THE ILLUMINATI.,"say nothing of Mrs. Frampton’s lodging-house, where every tenant was"
4170,THE ILLUMINATI.,"of a different sentiment,--and the several floors afforded a striking"
4171,THE ILLUMINATI.,example of the Clare Obscure.
4172,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4173,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Among general illuminations, I remember none more so than the one on"
4174,THE ILLUMINATI.,the accession of his late Majesty--but what so universally brightened
4175,THE ILLUMINATI.,the Great Britain might be expected to light the Little one. It was in
4176,THE ILLUMINATI.,"reality an unrivalled exhibition of its kind, and I propose therefore"
4177,THE ILLUMINATI.,"to give some account of it, the situation of my apartment having"
4178,THE ILLUMINATI.,afforded unusual opportunities--for it is at the angle of a corner
4179,THE ILLUMINATI.,house and thus while its easterly windows stare into those of the
4180,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Rumbold family, its northern ones squint aside into the sashes of that"
4181,THE ILLUMINATI.,elderly spinster Miss Winter.
4182,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4183,THE ILLUMINATI.,It must have been an extreme fit of loyalty that put such a thought
4184,THE ILLUMINATI.,"into the penurious mind of Miss W., but she resolved for once in her"
4185,THE ILLUMINATI.,life to illuminate. I could see her at a large dining-table--so called
4186,THE ILLUMINATI.,"by courtesy, for it never dined--reviewing a regiment of glass custard"
4187,THE ILLUMINATI.,"cups, so called also by courtesy, for they never held custard--and"
4188,THE ILLUMINATI.,"another division of tall jelly glasses, equally unknown to jellies."
4189,THE ILLUMINATI.,I might have thought that she meant for once to give a very light
4190,THE ILLUMINATI.,"supper, had I not seen her fill them all with oil from a little tin"
4191,THE ILLUMINATI.,"can, and afterwards she furnished them with a floating wick. They were"
4192,THE ILLUMINATI.,"then ranged on the window-frame, alternately tall and short; and after"
4193,THE ILLUMINATI.,"this costly preparation, which, by the heaving of her neckerchief, she"
4194,THE ILLUMINATI.,"visibly sighed over, she folded her arms demurely before her, and, by"
4195,THE ILLUMINATI.,"the light of her solitary rush taper, sat down to await the extravagant"
4196,THE ILLUMINATI.,call of “Light-up!”
4197,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4198,THE ILLUMINATI.,The elder Miss Rumbold--the parents were out of town--was not idle
4199,THE ILLUMINATI.,in the mean time. She packed all the little R.’s off to bed--(I did
4200,THE ILLUMINATI.,"not see them have any supper)--and then, having got rid of the family"
4201,THE ILLUMINATI.,"branches, began on the tin ones. She had fixed her head quarters in"
4202,THE ILLUMINATI.,"the drawing-room, from whence I saw Caroline and Henry detached, with"
4203,THE ILLUMINATI.,"separate parcels of tins and candles, to do the same office for the"
4204,THE ILLUMINATI.,"floors above and below. But no such luck! After a while, the street"
4205,THE ILLUMINATI.,"door gently opened, and forth sneaked the two deserters, of course to"
4206,THE ILLUMINATI.,see better illuminations than their own. At the slam of the door behind
4207,THE ILLUMINATI.,"them Miss Rumbold comprehended the full calamity: first, she threw up"
4208,THE ILLUMINATI.,"her arms, then her eyes, then clenched her teeth and then her hands;"
4209,THE ILLUMINATI.,going through all the pantomime for distress of mind--but she had no
4210,THE ILLUMINATI.,"time for grieving, and indeed but little for rejoicing. Mr. Wix’s was"
4211,THE ILLUMINATI.,beginning to glitter. Tearing up and down stairs like a lamplighter on
4212,THE ILLUMINATI.,"his ladder, she furnished all the blank windows, and then returned to"
4213,THE ILLUMINATI.,"the drawing-room; and what was evidently her favourite fancy, she had"
4214,THE ILLUMINATI.,completed and hung up two festoons of artificial flowers; but alas!
4215,THE ILLUMINATI.,her stock on hand fell short a whole foot of the third window--I am
4216,THE ILLUMINATI.,afraid for want of the very bouquet in Caroline’s bonnet. Removing the
4217,THE ILLUMINATI.,"unfortunate garlands, she rushed out full speed, and the next moment I"
4218,THE ILLUMINATI.,"saw her in the story above, rapidly unpapering her curls, and making"
4219,THE ILLUMINATI.,"herself as fit as time allowed, to sit in state in the drawing-room, by"
4220,THE ILLUMINATI.,the light of twenty-seven long sixes.

4224,THE ILLUMINATI.,"A violent uproar now recalled my attention to Number 29, where the mob"
4225,THE ILLUMINATI.,had begun to call out to Miss Winter for her Northern Lights. Miss W.
4226,THE ILLUMINATI.,"was at her post, and rushed with her rush to comply with the demand;"
4227,THE ILLUMINATI.,"but a sudden twitter of nervousness aggravating her old palsy, she"
4228,THE ILLUMINATI.,could not persuade her wavering taper to alight on any one of the
4229,THE ILLUMINATI.,"cottons. There was a deal of coquetting indeed between wick and wick,"
4230,THE ILLUMINATI.,but nothing like a mutual flame. In vain the thin lover-like candle
4231,THE ILLUMINATI.,"kept hovering over its intended, and shedding tears of grease at every"
4232,THE ILLUMINATI.,"repulse; not a glimmer replied to its glance, till at last, weary of"
4233,THE ILLUMINATI.,"love and light, it fairly leaped out of its tin socket, and drowned its"
4234,THE ILLUMINATI.,"own twinkle in a tall jelly-glass. The patience of the mob, already"
4235,THE ILLUMINATI.,"of a thin texture, was torn to rags by this conclusion; they saw that"
4236,THE ILLUMINATI.,"if she would, Miss Winter never _could_ illuminate: but as this was"
4237,THE ILLUMINATI.,"an unwelcome truth, they broke it to her with a volley of stones that"
4238,THE ILLUMINATI.,"destroyed her little Vauxhall in a moment, and in a twinkle left her"
4239,THE ILLUMINATI.,nothing to twinkle with!
4240,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4241,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Shocked at this catastrophe, I turned with some anxiety to Miss"
4242,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Rumbold’s, but with admirable presence of mind she had lighted"
4243,THE ILLUMINATI.,"every alternate candle in her windows, and was thus able to present"
4244,THE ILLUMINATI.,"a respectable front at a short notice. The mob, however, made as"
4245,THE ILLUMINATI.,"much uproar as at Miss Winter’s, though the noise was different in"
4246,THE ILLUMINATI.,"character, and more resembled the boisterous merriment which attends"
4247,THE ILLUMINATI.,upon Punch. In fact Miss Rumbold had a Fantoccini over head she little
4248,THE ILLUMINATI.,"dreamt of. Awakened by the unusual light, the younger Rumbolds had"
4249,THE ILLUMINATI.,"rushed from bed to the window, where, exhilarated by childish spirits"
4250,THE ILLUMINATI.,"and the appearance of a gala, they had got up an extempore Juvenile"
4251,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Ball, and were dancing with all their might in their little nightcaps"
4252,THE ILLUMINATI.,"and nightgowns. In vain the unconscious Matilda pointed to her candles,"
4253,THE ILLUMINATI.,and added her own private pair from the table to the centre window; in
4254,THE ILLUMINATI.,"vain she wrung her hands, or squeezed them on her bosom: the more she"
4255,THE ILLUMINATI.,"protested in dumb show, the more the mob shouted; and the more the mob"
4256,THE ILLUMINATI.,"shouted, the wilder the imps jigged about. At last Matilda seemed to"
4257,THE ILLUMINATI.,"take some hint; she vanished from the drawing-room like a Ghost, and"
4258,THE ILLUMINATI.,reappeared like a Fury in the nursery--a pair of large hands vigorously
4259,THE ILLUMINATI.,flourished and flogged--the heels of the Corps de Ballet flew up higher
4260,THE ILLUMINATI.,than their heads--the mob shouted louder than ever--and exeunt omnes.
4261,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4262,THE ILLUMINATI.,"This interlude being over, the rabble moved on to Mr. Wix’s, whose"
4263,THE ILLUMINATI.,"every window, as usual, shone “like nine good deeds in a naughty"
4264,THE ILLUMINATI.,"world,” and he obtained nine cheers for the display. Poor Mr. Sperm"
4265,THE ILLUMINATI.,was not so fortunate. He had been struggling manfully with a sharp
4266,THE ILLUMINATI.,"nor-wester to light up his star, but one obstinate limb persisted in"
4267,THE ILLUMINATI.,"showing which way the wind blew. It was a point not to be gained,"
4268,THE ILLUMINATI.,"and though far from red hot, it caused a hiss that reached even to"
4269,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Number 14, and frightened all the Flowerdews. Number 14, as the Clown"
4270,THE ILLUMINATI.,"expresses it in Twelfth Night, was “as lustrous as ebony.” In vain Mrs."
4271,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Flowerdew pleaded from one window, and Mr. Flowerdew harangued from"
4272,THE ILLUMINATI.,"the other, while Flowerdew junior hammered and tugged at the space"
4273,THE ILLUMINATI.,between; the glaziers and their friends unglazed everything; and I hope
4274,THE ILLUMINATI.,"the worthy family, the next time they have a Crown and Anchor, will"
4275,THE ILLUMINATI.,remember to have them the right side uppermost. Green and yellow lamps
4276,THE ILLUMINATI.,"decline to hang upon hooks that are topsy-turvy, and the blue and red"
4277,THE ILLUMINATI.,are just as particular.
4278,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4279,THE ILLUMINATI.,"I forgot to say that during the past proceedings, my eyes had"
4280,THE ILLUMINATI.,"frequently glanced towards Number 28. Its occupier, Mr. Brookbank, was"
4281,THE ILLUMINATI.,"in some remote way connected with the royal household, and had openly"
4282,THE ILLUMINATI.,expressed his intention of surprising Little Britain. And in truth
4283,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Little Britain was surprised enough, when it beheld at Mr. Brookbank’s"
4284,THE ILLUMINATI.,"nothing but a few sorry flambeaux: he talked to the mob, indeed, of"
4285,THE ILLUMINATI.,"a transparency of Peace and Plenty, but as they could see no sign of"
4286,THE ILLUMINATI.,"either, and they had plenty of stones, they again broke the peace. I am"
4287,THE ILLUMINATI.,"sorry to say that in this instance the mob were wrong, for there _was_"
4288,THE ILLUMINATI.,"a transparency, but as it was lighted from the outer side, Mr. B.’s"
4289,THE ILLUMINATI.,Peace and Plenty smiled on nobody but himself.
4290,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4291,THE ILLUMINATI.,"There was only one more disorder, and it occurred at the very house"
4292,THE ILLUMINATI.,"that I help to inhabit. Not that we were dim by any means, for we had"
4293,THE ILLUMINATI.,been liberal customers to Mr. Sperm and to Mr. Wix: the tallow of one
4294,THE ILLUMINATI.,"flared in all our panes, and the oil of the other fed a brilliant W. P."
4295,THE ILLUMINATI.,"Alas! it was these fiery initials, enigmatical as those at Belshazzar’s"
4296,THE ILLUMINATI.,"banquet, that caused all our troubles. The million could make out the"
4297,THE ILLUMINATI.,"meaning of the W, but the other letter, divided in conjecture among"
4298,THE ILLUMINATI.,"them, was literally a split P. Curiosity increased to furiosity, and"
4299,THE ILLUMINATI.,"what might have happened nobody only knows, if my landlady had not"
4300,THE ILLUMINATI.,"proclaimed that her W had spent such a double allowance of lamps, that"
4301,THE ILLUMINATI.,her R had been obliged to retrench.
4302,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4303,THE ILLUMINATI.,[Illustration: IGNIS FATUUS.]

4305,THE ILLUMINATI.,"To aid her oratory, the rabble were luckily attracted from our own"
4306,THE ILLUMINATI.,display by a splendour greater even than usual at Number 9. The
4307,THE ILLUMINATI.,warehouseman of Mr. Wix--_like Master like Man_--had got up an
4308,THE ILLUMINATI.,"illumination of his own, by leaving a firebrand among the tallow, that"
4309,THE ILLUMINATI.,"soon caused the breaking out of an insurrection in Grease, and where"
4310,THE ILLUMINATI.,"candles had hitherto been lighted only by Retail, they were now ignited"
4311,THE ILLUMINATI.,"by Wholesale; or as my landlady said,--“All the fat was in the fire!”"
4312,THE ILLUMINATI.,
4313,THE ILLUMINATI.,"I ventured to ask her when all was over, what she thought of the"
4314,THE ILLUMINATI.,"lighting-up, and she gave me her opinion in the following sentiment, in"
4315,THE ILLUMINATI.,"the prayer of which I most heartily concur. “Illuminations,” she said,"
4316,THE ILLUMINATI.,"“were very pretty things to look at, and no doubt new Kings ought to be"
4317,THE ILLUMINATI.,"illuminated; but what with the toil, and what with the oil, and what"
4318,THE ILLUMINATI.,"with the grease, and what with the mob, she hoped it would be long,"
4319,THE ILLUMINATI.,"very long, before we had a new King again!”"

4601,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"In my M. S. days,--and like many bookish bachelors of the same"
4602,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"standing,--I was a member of a private literary society, with a name"
4603,THE ELLAND MEETING.,whereof I only remember that it began in Greek and ended in English.
4604,THE ELLAND MEETING.,This re-union was framed on the usual plan of such institutions;
4605,THE ELLAND MEETING.,except that the gallantry of the founders had ruled that half the
4606,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"members might be of the female sex, and accordingly amongst our"
4607,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"“intellectual legs,” we numbered a fair proportion of the hose that are"
4608,THE ELLAND MEETING.,metaphorically blue. We assembled weekly at the house of some Fellow
4609,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"that had a house, where an original essay was first read by the author,"
4610,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"and then submitted to discussion, much as a school-boy first spins his"
4611,THE ELLAND MEETING.,top and then lays it down to be pegged at by the rest of the company.
4612,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"The subjects, like Sir Roger de Coverley’s picture, generally left a"
4613,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"great deal to be said on both sides, nor were there wanting choppers,"
4614,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"not to say hackers of logic, to avail themselves of the circumstance;"
4615,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"and as we possessed, amongst others, a brace of Irish barristers, a"
4616,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"Quaker, a dissenter to everything, an author who spoke volumes, a"
4617,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"geologist who could find sermons in stones, and one old man eloquent,"
4618,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"surnamed for his discursiveness the rambler, we had usually what Bubb"
4619,THE ELLAND MEETING.,Doddington has called “a multiplicity of talk.”
4620,THE ELLAND MEETING.,
4621,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"It is worthy of record, however, and especially as running counter"
4622,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"to the received opinion of the loquacity of the sex, that no female"
4623,THE ELLAND MEETING.,member was ever known to deliver or attempt to deliver a sentence on
4624,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"the subject in debate. Now and then, perchance, a short clearing cough"
4625,THE ELLAND MEETING.,would flatter us that we were going to benefit by feminine taste and
4626,THE ELLAND MEETING.,delicacy of sentiment; but the expectation invariably fell to the
4627,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"ground, and we might as well have expected an opinion to transpire from"
4628,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"the wax work of Mrs. Salmon or Madame Tussaud. I have since learned, it"
4629,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"is true, from one of the maturest of the she-fellows, that she did once"
4630,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"actually contemplate a few words to the matter in hand, but that at the"
4631,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"very first stitch she lost her needle, by which she meant her tongue,"
4632,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"and then in seeking for her needle she lost the thread of her ideas,"
4633,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"and so gave up the task, she said, as not being “woman’s work.”"
4634,THE ELLAND MEETING.,
4635,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"It would seem therefore, that a set discourse in company is altogether"
4636,THE ELLAND MEETING.,incompatible with the innate diffidence and shrinking timidity
4637,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"of the sex. Milton, indeed, makes this silent modesty a peculiar"
4638,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"characteristic of perfect womanhood, as evinced in the demeanour of"
4639,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"“accomplished Eve.” To mark it the more strongly, he liberally endows"
4640,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"our general mother with fluency of speech in her colloquies with Adam,"
4641,THE ELLAND MEETING.,so as even to “forget all time” in conversing with him; whereas in
4642,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"the presence of a third party,--the Angel Visitor for instance, whom"
4643,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"she less bids than makes welcome to her dessert,--she seldom opens"
4644,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"her lips. Nor is this an overstrained picture: the same matronly, or"
4645,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"spinsterly reserve, having survived the Fall, and the confusion of"
4646,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"Babel, and the more womanly of her daughters, however good at what the"
4647,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"Scotch call “a two-handed crack,” in a corner or behind a curtain will"
4648,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"still evince a paradisiacal hesitation, amounting to an impediment, in"
4649,THE ELLAND MEETING.,addressing the most limited audience. In fact up to a comparatively
4650,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"recent period, the Miltonic theory was practically acknowledged and"
4651,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"acted upon, at the theatre, the female characters of the Drama being"
4652,THE ELLAND MEETING.,always represented by proxies of men or boys.
4653,THE ELLAND MEETING.,
4654,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"Even in the present age, the début of an actress, having so many"
4655,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"“lengths” to deliver in public, is reckoned one of the severest ordeals"
4656,THE ELLAND MEETING.,that womanly modesty can undergo. The celebrated Mrs. Siddons described
4657,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"it as a “fiery trial,”--a “terrible moment,”--and any play-goer who has"
4658,THE ELLAND MEETING.,witnessed the first appearance of a young lady on any stage will easily
4659,THE ELLAND MEETING.,give credit for its agonies. The late Mrs. ---- once described to me
4660,THE ELLAND MEETING.,very vividly her sufferings on a like awful occasion:--“The voice that
4661,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"would not come, and the tremor that would not go--the frame inclining"
4662,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"to sink, and the head determined to swim,--the distinct consciousness"
4663,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"of the presence of the body, with the indistinct impression of the"
4664,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"absence of the mind. Thank Heaven,” she concluded, “that I had not to"
4665,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"‘extort’ the people, as Mawworm calls it, out of my own head--that I"
4666,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"had not to furnish the speech, as well as the courage to utter it; for"
4667,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"I protest that I could not have put together a sentence of my own, for"
4668,THE ELLAND MEETING.,the saving of my life!”

4671,THE ELLAND MEETING.,
4672,THE ELLAND MEETING.,With such experience and impressions of the inaptitude of the sex for
4673,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"popular orators, my profound amazement may be conceived when on lately"
4674,THE ELLAND MEETING.,"glancing over the columns of a morning journal, my eye was arrested by"
4675,THE ELLAND MEETING.,the extraordinary heading of
4676,THE ELLAND MEETING.,
4677,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.
4678,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,
4679,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"In the first tumult of my agitation I pitched my Morning Herald, where"
4680,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"Parson Adams threw his Æschylus, namely, behind the fire; but the very"
4681,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"next instant, with a vague notion that it would _blow_ up, I snatched"
4682,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"it out again. I am not certain,--being in weak health and spirits,"
4683,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"and more than commonly nervous,--that I did not cry murder!--My first"
4684,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"sensation, indeed, was a physical one, a complication of acuteness"
4685,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"of earache, with the numbness of lock-jaw:--and then came the moral"
4686,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"consciousness of some stunning domestic calamity, that seemed dilating"
4687,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,every instant from a family into a national visitation. In fact I
4688,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"recollect nothing at all approaching the first bodily shock, except"
4689,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"once, on the explosion of some neighbouring powder-mills, when a few"
4690,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,highly condensed moments of intense silence were followed by the sudden
4691,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"burst of an imaginary peal, from a bell assembly of all the steeples"
4692,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,in England; nor can I recall any experience equal to my mental horror
4693,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"afterwards, unless a certain delirious dream of being run away with by"
4694,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"four gray mares, in the York mail!"
4695,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,
4696,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,It was a considerable time before I could muster resolution to peruse
4697,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"the speeches, the tone of which my prophetic soul forestalled as"
4698,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"less resembling the notes of the feminine dulcimer, or piano, or"
4699,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"hurdy-gurdy, than those of the masculine brazen trumpet. And should"
4700,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"this seem a _harsh_ anticipation, it must be remembered that I had been"
4701,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,prepared by no previous rehearsals for such a burst of female oratory.
4702,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,If I had met with a paragraph hinting that certain females had been
4703,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"observed in rough weather, mysteriously haunting the sea-beach, say of"
4704,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"Scarborough for instance, and gesticulating, as if on speaking terms"
4705,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"with the billows, my classical reminiscences might have recalled the"
4706,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,system by which Demosthenes braced himself against the murmurs and
4707,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,roarings of a popular assembly--and I might have comprehended that the
4708,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,hoarse waves were resorted to as oratorical _breakers-in_. But there
4709,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,was no such warning; and consequently the report came upon me with
4710,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,all the startling suddenness and crash of a sempstress’s splitting a
4711,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,piece of stout calico. There was something astounding in the bare idea
4712,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"of a female voice, so commonly requiring a high pressure to induce"
4713,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"it to sing in private circles, volunteering in public assembly to"
4714,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,spout! A maiden speech even in a man is apt to excite a maidenly fever
4715,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"of nervousness; and many a rough and tough old sea-commander, who"
4716,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"would have returned a broadside without flinching, has been converted"
4717,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"physiognomically into an admiral of the blue, white, and red, and has"
4718,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"found a bung in his speaking-trumpet, on having to reply to a volley"
4719,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"of thanks. The very subject, so steeped in party spirit,--for alas! it"
4720,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,is undeniable that the woes and wants of the poor have become a party
4721,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"question,--the very subject so steeped in party spirit, always a raw"
4722,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"unrectified article, and at the present time distilled particularly"
4723,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"above proof, seemed peculiarly unfit for womanly lips. In short I"
4724,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"concluded primâ facie, that a female who could come forward, without"
4725,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"a rehearsal all along shore, or practise on provincial boards, as a"
4726,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"public orator, and on political topics, must needs be what some old"
4727,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"writer calls “a mankind woman,”--and akin to the Hannah Snells and Mary"
4728,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"Ann Talbots, that have heretofore enlisted in our army and navy. How"
4729,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,far I was justified in these forebodings a few extracts will serve to
4730,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,show.
4731,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,
4732,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"“Mrs. Susan Fearnley having been voted into the chair, opened the"
4733,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,business of the meeting by exhorting the females present _to take
4734,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"the question of a repeal of this bill into their own hands_, and"
4735,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"not to rely on the exertions of others, _least of all on the House"
4736,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"of Commons_, but at once to assert _the dignity and equality of the"
4737,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"sex_, and as the chief magistrate of the realm was now a female,"
4738,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"to approach her _respectfully_, and lay their grievances before"
4739,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"her; and, should their application be unsuccessful, she would then"
4740,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"call upon them to resist the enforcement of this cruel law, _even"
4741,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"unto the death_--(loud cheers). Mrs. Grasby said, the new Poor"
4742,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"Law was not concocted by men, but by fiends in the shape of men;"
4743,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,it had been hatched and bred in the bottomless pit--(cheers). She
4744,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"could wish the authors of this law to be sent to St. Helena, where"
4745,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"Napoleon was sent to, and remain till their bodies were wet with"
4746,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"the dew of heaven, and their hair as long as eagles’ feathers."
4747,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"She would oppose that law, and she called upon her sisters now"
4748,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,before her to follow her example--(tremendous cheering). Mrs.
4749,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,Hanson alluded to the personal disfiguration of the hair cutting
4750,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"off, which excited much disapprobation; this was followed by a"
4751,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,description of the grogram gowns of shoddy and paste in which
4752,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"the inmates of the bastiles are attired.” The address said, “We"
4753,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"approach your Majesty, and pray that you will exercise your"
4754,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"prerogative, and remove from your councils those heartless men who"
4755,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,are attempting to place us under this horrible law. _We beg leave
4756,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,to remind your Majesty that allegiance is due only when protection
4757,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,is extended to the subject._

4760,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"“SUSAN FEARNLEY, _Chairwoman_.”"
4761,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,
4762,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"And the report said, “Thanks were then voted with loud cheering to Earl"
4763,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"Stanhope, Mr. J. Fielden, to the Chairwoman, Mrs. Grasby, and Mrs."
4764,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"Hanson, for their eloquent speeches, and to the other females, who had"
4765,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,got up and managed the meeting. Three groans were then given for the
4766,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"Whigs, and all who support the Poor Law Bill.”"
4767,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,
4768,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,I have purposely omitted an astounding declaration of the wives and
4769,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"mothers in the address, about their daughters, hoping that it is only"
4770,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"founded on local scandal; and now, if such another merry meeting may"
4771,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"be wished, what right-thinking Benedict or Bachelor but will join with"
4772,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,me and Dogberry in a “God prohibit it?” When the Steam Washing Company
4773,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"was first established, there was a loud and shrill outcry against"
4774,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"what were facetiously called the Cock Laundresses, who were roundly"
4775,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"accused of a shameful invasion of woman’s provinces, and favoured"
4776,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"with many sneering recommendations to wear mob caps, and go in stuff"
4777,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,petticoats and pattens. But if Hercules with the distaff be but a sorry
4778,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"spectacle, surely Omphale with the club cuts scarcely a better figure."
4779,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"The he-creatures may now fairly retort, that it is as consistent"
4780,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"with manhood to go out washing, as for womanhood to do chairing at"
4781,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,a public meeting. If it be out of character for a fellow in a coat
4782,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"and continuations to be firsting and seconding linen, it is equally"
4783,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,anomalous for a creature in petticoats to be firsting and seconding
4784,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"political resolutions; and for my own part, as a matter of taste, I"
4785,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,would rather see a Gentlemen blowing up a copper flue than a Lady
4786,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,blowing up the foulness of the Poor Law.
4787,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,
4788,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"In the mean time, there is reason to apprehend that the infection is"
4789,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,gaining ground; the last post having brought me the following letter on

4792,PUBLIC MEETING OF WOMEN AGAINST THE POOR LAWS.,"_To the Editor of Hood’s Own, &c., &c._"

4794,"HONOURED SIR,","HONOURED SIR,"
4795,"HONOURED SIR,",
4796,"HONOURED SIR,",I don’t know whether you be married or likely to be in the way of
4797,"HONOURED SIR,","courting, but whether or not, most likely you have a mother or sister,"
4798,"HONOURED SIR,","or aunt, or she-cousin, or some such connexion of the female sex; as"
4799,"HONOURED SIR,","such will be interested in the following, as a matter that concerns"
4800,"HONOURED SIR,","us all, and particularly men like myself of a quiet turn and domestic"
4801,"HONOURED SIR,",habits.
4802,"HONOURED SIR,",
4803,"HONOURED SIR,","By station I am only a plain, family man in the farming line, but to my"
4804,"HONOURED SIR,","misfortune, as turns out, I am locally situated in the county of York,"
4805,"HONOURED SIR,","and what’s worse, a great deal too nigh Elland, and where the women"
4806,"HONOURED SIR,",got up the spouting meeting again the Poor Laws that made such a noise
4807,"HONOURED SIR,","in the country. I’m not a political character myself, and as such have"
4808,"HONOURED SIR,","nothing to object for or against public meetings and speechifyings,"
4809,"HONOURED SIR,",so long as it’s confined to the male kind; but with as good nerves
4810,"HONOURED SIR,","as most men that can ride to hounds, nothing since incendiarism has"
4811,"HONOURED SIR,","given them such a shook as the breaking out of female elocution, for"
4812,"HONOURED SIR,","in course like the rick burnings and the influenzy, or any other new"
4813,"HONOURED SIR,","kick, it will go through the whole country. My own house has catched"
4814,"HONOURED SIR,","for one, and I will inform you the symptoms it begins with. The Elland"
4815,"HONOURED SIR,","Meeting, you see, was on a Tuesday, and between you and me and the"
4816,"HONOURED SIR,","post, it’s my belief that my mistress was present, though she do say,"
4817,"HONOURED SIR,",it were a visit to her mother. Otherwise I cannot think what could put
4818,"HONOURED SIR,","her teeth into her head on the Wednesday for the first time, by which"
4819,"HONOURED SIR,","I mean to say her spelling for a new set, if it was not to assist her"
4820,"HONOURED SIR,",parts of speech. Agricultural distress has made gold much more scarce
4821,"HONOURED SIR,","among farmers than formerly, and I don’t mind saying it’s more than I"
4822,"HONOURED SIR,",could afford comfortably at most times to lay out twenty guineas in
4823,"HONOURED SIR,","ivory for the sake of a correct pronouncing. However I made no remark,"
4824,"HONOURED SIR,","except to myself, namely, that they wasn’t wanted to keep her tongue"
4825,"HONOURED SIR,",between. For my own part I have always found she could speak plain
4826,"HONOURED SIR,","enough, and particularly when I couldn’t--by reason of dining at the"
4827,"HONOURED SIR,",ordinary on market days and the like. Any way she always contrived to
4828,"HONOURED SIR,","speak her mind, but ever since the meeting she seems to have had more"
4829,"HONOURED SIR,","mind to speak; for instance, a long confabbing with every beggar at the"
4830,"HONOURED SIR,","gate, instead of sending off as formerly with nothing but a flea in"
4831,"HONOURED SIR,","their ear, as the saying is. In short, many more things struck me as"
4832,"HONOURED SIR,","suspicious, and amongst the rest, her making an errand again to Eland"
4833,"HONOURED SIR,","for a piece of stuff and a little fustian--in pint of fact, that visit"
4834,"HONOURED SIR,","seemed to set her more agog than before, so as to start a new notion of"
4835,"HONOURED SIR,","going up to London about Betsy’s impediment, and says she, I can kill"
4836,"HONOURED SIR,","two birds, and get my new teeth at the same time. If that don’t look"
4837,"HONOURED SIR,","oratorical, thinks I to myself, then I don’t know what does. However,"
4838,"HONOURED SIR,","last Sunday was a week lets the whole cat out of the bag, as the saying"
4839,"HONOURED SIR,","is as near as may be as follow. It was just after dinner, and only our"
4840,"HONOURED SIR,","two selves quite domestically, Betsy being gone to grandmother’s, and"
4841,"HONOURED SIR,","me going to take my first glass of wine, and so as usual, I nodded to"
4842,"HONOURED SIR,","my good woman, with a “Here’s to ye, Kate!” according to custom--when"
4843,"HONOURED SIR,","lo! and behold, up jumps Madam regularly on her legs opening like a"
4844,"HONOURED SIR,","hound that has just hit the scent, and begins a return thanks, and"
4845,"HONOURED SIR,","delivery of sentiments and so forth, before I knew where I was. Where"
4846,"HONOURED SIR,","she got the knack of it without practice, Lord knows, for it’s more"
4847,"HONOURED SIR,","than ever I was competent to, as for instance, when I’ve been publicly"
4848,"HONOURED SIR,","drunk at our Coursing Club, and the like. However she was five good"
4849,"HONOURED SIR,","minutes long afore she broke down, or recollected herself, I don’t know"
4850,"HONOURED SIR,","which, and I’m free to say, left me so dumbfounded in a mizmaze that I"
4851,"HONOURED SIR,","hadn’t presence of mind to argue the point. However, before going to"
4852,"HONOURED SIR,","bed, I thought best to open gently on the subject, but as might be"
4853,"HONOURED SIR,","expected, the more we differed, the more we debated, which in course"
4854,"HONOURED SIR,","was just what Madam wanted, till at long and at last, seeing that I"
4855,"HONOURED SIR,","was only being practised upon, like Betsy’s piano, I thought proper to"
4856,"HONOURED SIR,","adjourn myself off to roost, but from the nature of my dreams, have"
4857,"HONOURED SIR,",reason to think she continued the argument in her sleep.
4858,"HONOURED SIR,",
4859,"HONOURED SIR,","And now, honoured Sir, what is to be done to stop such a national"
4860,"HONOURED SIR,","calamity as hangs over us like a thundercloud, unless it’s put down"
4861,"HONOURED SIR,",by the powerful voice of the public press? Not wishing to connect
4862,"HONOURED SIR,","myself with politics, which all newspapers are more or less inclined"
4863,"HONOURED SIR,","to, and your periodical being mentioned to me by our doctor as an"
4864,"HONOURED SIR,","impartial vehicle, am induced to the liberty of this communication, to"
4865,"HONOURED SIR,",be made use of at your discretion. My own sentiments are very strong
4866,"HONOURED SIR,","on the subject, but more than I can express by penmanship. We have a"
4867,"HONOURED SIR,",saying here in the north about a crowing hen that seems quite pat to
4868,"HONOURED SIR,","the case. And if you keep live stock, what can cut a foolisher figure"
4869,"HONOURED SIR,","than a great gawksome hen, leaving her eggs to addle in the neat, or"
4870,"HONOURED SIR,","her chicks, if so be, to the care of the kite, to go a spurring and"
4871,"HONOURED SIR,","sparring about the yard with her hackle up, and trying to crow like"
4872,"HONOURED SIR,",a cock of the walk? So it is with the mistress of a house leaving

5021,A STEP-FATHER.,
5022,A STEP-FATHER.,
5023,A STEP-FATHER.,"“Follow, follow, follow, follow,"
5024,A STEP-FATHER.,"Follow, follow, follow me.”--OLD SONG."
5025,A STEP-FATHER.,
5026,A STEP-FATHER.,
5027,A STEP-FATHER.,"I know not what friend, or fiend, or both together, put such a folly"
5028,A STEP-FATHER.,"into the head of my maternal parent; but, like Hamlet’s mother, she set"
5029,A STEP-FATHER.,"her widow’s cap at the sex, and re-married. A second marriage is seldom"
5030,A STEP-FATHER.,a favourable alteration of state; it is like changing a sovereign
5031,A STEP-FATHER.,"twice over; first into silver, and then into copper. My mother’s step"
5032,A STEP-FATHER.,"was of this description! My first father was a plump, short, and"
5033,A STEP-FATHER.,"rather Dutch-built little person; but the most merry, good-humoured,"
5034,A STEP-FATHER.,"and kind-hearted, yet withal the slowest goer of the human race. His"
5035,A STEP-FATHER.,"successor was saturnine in spirit, and stern in temper, a tall bony"
5036,A STEP-FATHER.,"figure, remarkable for the length of his nether limbs; he was, to adopt"
5037,A STEP-FATHER.,"a school-boy phrase, a Walker by name, and a walker by nature; and"
5038,A STEP-FATHER.,the exercise of this propensity taught me painfully to appreciate the
5039,A STEP-FATHER.,difference between my dear first Daddy and my Daddy-Long-legs.
5040,A STEP-FATHER.,
5041,A STEP-FATHER.,My father Heavy-sides was what is called slow and sure: which means
5042,A STEP-FATHER.,"sure to be left behind. He had a solemn creak in his shoes, that"
5043,A STEP-FATHER.,declared how deliberately his toes turned on their hinges; his movement
5044,A STEP-FATHER.,through life was a minuet de la cour. My Step-father Walker’s was a
5045,A STEP-FATHER.,"galopade. Considered as Foot Soldiers, or adverse parties of infantry,"
5046,A STEP-FATHER.,"before one had well marched into his position, the other would have"
5047,A STEP-FATHER.,"turned his right flank, cut off his left wing, charged his centre,"
5048,A STEP-FATHER.,"harassed his rear, and surrounded his whole body. They were, alas!"
5049,A STEP-FATHER.,"literally the quick and the dead, causing between them a race of my"
5050,A STEP-FATHER.,"toes against my tears, and, if anything, my toes ran the fastest and"
5051,A STEP-FATHER.,farthest.
5052,A STEP-FATHER.,
5053,A STEP-FATHER.,There has been lately a good deal of speculation as to the ownership
5054,A STEP-FATHER.,of a certain poem; but I feel assured that my Step-father was the
5055,A STEP-FATHER.,practical author of the “Devil’s Walk.” The March of Mind might
5056,A STEP-FATHER.,"possibly have kept up with him, but no March of body could do it; least"
5057,A STEP-FATHER.,"of all, such a body as mine, naturally heavy, and furnished with a pair"
5058,A STEP-FATHER.,"of lower limbs, very different from those of the son of Scriblerus,"
5059,A STEP-FATHER.,who made his legs his compasses for measuring islands and continents.
5060,A STEP-FATHER.,"Strain them as I would in pursuit of my Step-father, I seemed to"
5061,A STEP-FATHER.,take nothing by my motion; those hopeless coat-flaps were always in
5062,A STEP-FATHER.,"front; like Doctor Johnson’s great Shakspeare, with little Time at his"
5063,A STEP-FATHER.,"heels, I panted after him in vain. The pace, as the jockeys say, was"
5064,A STEP-FATHER.,"severe. It was literally a flight of steps, for he seemed to fly; if"
5065,A STEP-FATHER.,"any gentleman could be in two places at once, like a bird, that man"
5066,A STEP-FATHER.,"was my Step-father, or rather Fore-father, for he was always in front."
5067,A STEP-FATHER.,"His stride was that of the Colossus of Rhodes; like Robinson Crusoe,"
5068,A STEP-FATHER.,"you could discern one foot-print in the sand, but the other was beyond"
5069,A STEP-FATHER.,discovery. My infatuated mother was nevertheless continually holding
5070,A STEP-FATHER.,"him out to me as an example, and recommending me to “tread in his"
5071,A STEP-FATHER.,"steps!”--I wish I had been able! When his friends, or creditors, have"
5072,A STEP-FATHER.,"been informed at the door, that he “had just stept out,” how little did"
5073,A STEP-FATHER.,they dream that it meant he was a mile off!
5074,A STEP-FATHER.,
5075,A STEP-FATHER.,"It was his pleasure, whenever my Step-father walked, that I should"
5076,A STEP-FATHER.,accompany him; such accompaniment as flute adagio is sometimes heard
5077,A STEP-FATHER.,"to give to piano prestissimo. He seemed to pride himself, like some"
5078,A STEP-FATHER.,"pompous people, in constantly having a poor foot-boy trotting it his"
5079,A STEP-FATHER.,"heels: often did I beg to be left at home; often, but vainly, address"
5080,A STEP-FATHER.,"him in the language of old Capulet’s domestic--“Good thou, save me a"
5081,A STEP-FATHER.,"piece of _march-pane_.” The descriptive phrase of “rocky fastnesses,”"
5082,A STEP-FATHER.,was but too typical of his speed and temper; he had no more pity for
5083,A STEP-FATHER.,"me, than the great striding Ogre, in the Seven-leagued Boots, for"
5084,A STEP-FATHER.,little Hop-o’-my-Thumb.
5085,A STEP-FATHER.,
5086,A STEP-FATHER.,"The day of retribution at last came, for, according to the clown’s"
5087,A STEP-FATHER.,"doctrine, the whirligig of time always brings round its revenges. My"
5088,A STEP-FATHER.,"poor mother died, and had a walking funeral, and my Step-father felt"
5089,A STEP-FATHER.,more for her than I had expected; but he suffered most in his legs and
5090,A STEP-FATHER.,feet: the measured pace of the procession afflicted him beyond measure;
5091,A STEP-FATHER.,"he longed to give sorrow strides, but was forbidden; and he walked"
5092,A STEP-FATHER.,and grieved like a fiery horse upon the fret. The slow pace seemed
5093,A STEP-FATHER.,as a slow poison: it has been affirmed that he caught cold upon the
5094,A STEP-FATHER.,"occasion; but whether he did or not,--from that day he took ill, went"
5095,A STEP-FATHER.,"off rapidly, as he always did, in a galloping consumption, and died,"
5096,A STEP-FATHER.,"leaving me, as usual, behind him. In compliance with his last wish,"
5097,A STEP-FATHER.,"he was furnished with a walking funeral, and, as decency dictated, I"
5098,A STEP-FATHER.,followed him to the grave; though in truth it was sacrificing the only
5099,A STEP-FATHER.,"opportunity I ever had in the world, of getting before him."
5100,A STEP-FATHER.,
5101,A STEP-FATHER.,"I have been told that, the evening of his decease, his apparition"
5102,A STEP-FATHER.,"appeared to a first cousin at Penryn, and the same night to his brother"
5103,A STEP-FATHER.,"at Appleby. I have no particular faith in Ghosts, but this I do most"
5104,A STEP-FATHER.,"firmly believe, that if any Body had the Spirit to do the distance, in"
5105,A STEP-FATHER.,"the time, it was the very Spirit of my Step-father Walker."

5354,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,
5355,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,It seems but the other day--instead of nearly ten years ago--that
5356,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"my drawing-room door opened, and the female servant, with a very"
5357,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"peculiar expression of countenance, announced a memorable visitor."
5358,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,Shakspeare has enquired “What is there in a name?” But most assuredly
5359,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,he would have withdrawn the question could he have seen the effect of
5360,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,a patronymic on our Sarah’s risible muscles. To render the phenomenon
5361,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"more striking, she was a maiden little addicted to the merry mood: on"
5362,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"the contrary, she was rather more sedate than her age warranted. Her"
5363,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,face was of a cast decidedly serious--quiet brow--steady eyes--sober
5364,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"nose--precise mouth, and solemn chin, which she doubled by drawing"
5365,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,it in demurely against her neck. The habitual expression of her
5366,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"physiognomy was as grave, short of actual sadness, as human face could"
5367,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"assume, reminding you of those set, solid, composed, very decorous"
5368,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"visages, that indifferent persons put on for the day at a funeral: her"
5369,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,very complexion was uniformly colourless--pale yet not clear--that
5370,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"_slack-baked_ look which forbids the idea of levity. When she smiled,"
5371,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"which was rarely, and in cases where most females of her years would"
5372,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"have indulged in a titter, or excusable laugh, it was the faintest"
5373,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"possible approach to hilarity--the corners of her mouth curving, if"
5374,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"anything a little downwards. Nothing, in fact, less than galvanism,"
5375,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"which “sets corpses a-grinning,” seemed likely to shock her features"
5376,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"into any broad demonstration of jocularity, and yet, lo! there she was,"
5377,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,her face shortened by half its length--her mouth stretching from ear to
5378,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"ear, and hardly able, for a suppressed giggle, to articulate its brief"

5387,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"was a glorious illustration of the Pleasures of Memory, to behold"

5389,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"into ripples and radiance, like the brook that laughs in the sun. What"
5390,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,recollections of exquisite fooling must have rushed into her fancy
5391,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"to convert that Quakerly maiden, as by a stage metamorphosis, into a"
5392,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,perfect figure of fun! What grotesque fantastic shapes must have come
5393,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"tumbling, rolling, crawling, dangling, dancing, prancing, floundering,"
5394,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"flopping, striding, sliding, ambling, shambling, scrambling,"
5395,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"stumbling, bundling, and trundling into her mind’s eye, to so startle"

5397,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"telegraphic brows--rolling, reeling, goggling, ogling, hard-winking,"
5398,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"and soft-blinking eyes--and grinning, gaping, pinching, puckering"
5399,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,mouths must have grimaced at her to put her steady countenance so out

5401,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"decrepid man had but to announce himself, and Presto! Prestissimo!"
5402,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,before an engineer could cry “Ease her! stop her! back her!” our Sarah
5403,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,had retraced her course up the stream of time to the bright wintry

5406,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"of his sect, without pass or manipulation, thus throw a sedate, orderly"
5407,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"maiden, into an ecstasy, and set her looking through the back of her"
5408,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,head at the pantomimical experiences of the past? Talk of Laughing Gas!
5409,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,when was there a facetious fluid so potent that the mere sight of the
5410,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"empty bottle--(for such, alas! the ex-clown was become)--could throw"
5411,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,the ticklesome muscles into merry convulsions?
5412,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,
5413,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"I have often speculated since on Sarah’s deportment, when, having"
5414,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"ushered “Mr. Grimaldi, alias Joe,” into the drawing-room, she returned"
5415,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"to her kitchen. Of course, in the first flutter and frisk of her animal"
5416,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"spirits, she postponed all domestic duties; or, at best, obliviously"
5417,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"broke the eggs into the flower tub, popped the lump of butter into"
5418,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"the oven, and secured the rolling-pin in the safe. More probably she"
5419,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,dropped herself into the first chair that offered; and throwing her
5420,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"apron over her head to shut out the daylight, indulged in a lamplight"
5421,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"vision of the drolleries of Mother Goose, or the Sleeping Beauty; when"
5422,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,the frolics of funny Joe had cheated her for awhile of the sorrows of
5423,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"servitude, low wages, a crustaceous mistress, a _perfidus_ young man,"
5424,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"and a hard place, with perhaps the bodily pains of a recent scald, a"
5425,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"bad bruise, and tight shoes. No doubt it had been one of her wishes,"
5426,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"born of wonder and curiosity, to see the popular Motley off the stage"
5427,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"“in his habit as he lived;” and lo! beyond her hope, she had met him"
5428,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"face to face without his paint, and been on speaking terms with that"
5429,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"marvellous voice, so sparingly heard, even on the stage."
5430,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,
5431,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"For my own part, I confess to have been somewhat unsettled as well as"
5432,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,the bewildered maid by pantomimical associations. Slowly and seriously
5433,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"as my visitor advanced, and with a decided stoop, I could not forget"
5434,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"that I had seen the same personage come in with two odd eyebrows, a"
5435,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"pair of right-and-left eyes, a wry nose, a crooked mouth, two wrong"
5436,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"arms, two left legs, and a free and easy body without a bone in it, or"
5437,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,apparently any centre of gravity. I was half prepared to hear that rare
5438,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"voice break forth smart as the smack of a waggoner’s whip, or richly"
5439,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"stick and chuckling, like the utterance of a boy laughing, talking, and"
5440,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"eating custard, all at once, but a short interval sufficed to dispel"
5441,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"the pleasant illusion, and convinced me that the Grimaldi was a total"
5442,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,wreck.
5443,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,
5444,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"“Alas! how changed from him,"
5445,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"The life of humour, and the soul of whim.”"
5446,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,
5447,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,The lustre of his bright eye was gone--his eloquent face was passive
5448,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,and looked thrown out of work--and his frame was bowed down by no
5449,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,feigned decrepitude. His melancholy errand to me related to a Farewell
5450,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"Address, which at the invitation of his staunch friend Miss Kelly--for"
5451,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,it did not require a request--I had undertaken to indite. He pleaded
5452,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"earnestly that it might be brief, being, he said, “a bad study,” as"
5453,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,well as distrustful of his bodily strength. Of his sufferings he spoke
5454,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"with a sad but resigned tone, expressed deep regret at quitting a"
5455,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"profession he delighted in, and partly attributed the sudden breaking"
5456,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"down of his health to the superior size of one particular stage,"
5457,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,which required of him a jump extra in getting off. That additional
5458,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"bound, like the bittock at the end of a Scotch mile, had, he thought,"
5459,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,overtasked his strength. His whole deportment and conversation
5460,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"impressed me with the opinion that he was a simple, sensible,"
5461,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"warm-hearted being, such indeed as he appears in his Memoirs--a Joseph"
5462,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"after Parson Adams’s own heart. We shook hands heartily, parted, and"
5463,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"I never saw him again. He was a rare practical humorist, and I never"

5465,A SERIO-COMIC REMINISCENCE.,"appetite for “plenty of links, chitterlings, and puddings,” in their"

5560,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5561,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5562,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"“The Devil choke thee with un!”--as Master Giles, the Yeoman, said"
5563,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"this, he banged down a hand in size and colour like a ham, on the"
5564,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,old-fashioned oak table;--“I do say the Devil choke thee with un!”
5565,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5566,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,The Dame made no reply: she was choking with passion and a fowl’s
5567,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,liver--the original cause of the dispute. A great deal has been said
5568,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"and sung of the advantage of congenial tastes amongst married people,"
5569,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"but true it is, the variances of our Kentish couple arose from this"
5570,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,very coincidence in gusto. They were both fond of the little delicacy
5571,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"in question, but the Dame had managed to secure the morsel for herself,"
5572,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,and this was sufficient to cause a storm of very high words--which
5573,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"properly understood, signifies very low language. Their mealtimes"
5574,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"seldom passed over without some contention of the sort,--as sure as the"
5575,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"knives and forks clashed, so did they--being in fact equally greedy and"
5576,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,disagreedy--and when they did pick a quarrel--they picked it to the
5577,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,bone.
5578,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5579,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,[Illustration: BOXER AND PINCHER.]
5580,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5581,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"It was reported, that on some occasions they had not even contented"
5582,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"themselves with hard speeches, but they had come to scuffling--he"
5583,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"taking to boxing, and she to pinching--though in a far less amicable"
5584,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,manner than is practised by the takers of snuff. On the present
5585,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"difference, however, they were satisfied with “wishing each other dead"
5586,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,with all their hearts”--and there seemed little doubt of the sincerity
5587,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"of the aspiration, on looking at their malignant faces,--for they made"
5588,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,a horrible picture in this frame of mind.
5589,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5590,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,Now it happened that this quarrel took place on the morning of St.
5591,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"Mark,--a Saint who was supposed on that Festival to favour his Votaries"
5592,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,with a peep into the Book of Fate. For it was the popular belief in
5593,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"those days, that if a person should keep watch towards midnight, beside"
5594,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"the church, the apparitions of all those of the parish who were to be"
5595,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"taken by Death before the next anniversary, would be seen entering the"
5596,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"porch. The Yeoman, like his neighbours, believed most devoutly in this"
5597,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,superstition--and in the very moment that he breathed the unseemly
5598,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"aspiration aforesaid, it occurred to him, that the Even was at hand,"
5599,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"when by observing the rite of St. Mark, he might know to a certainty"
5600,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,whether this unchristian wish was to be one of those that bear fruit.
5601,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"Accordingly, a little before midnight he stole quietly out of the"
5602,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"house, and in something of a Sexton-like spirit set forth on his way to"
5603,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,the Church.
5604,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5605,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,In the mean time the Dame called to mind the same ceremonial; and
5606,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"having the like motive for curiosity with her husband, she also put on"
5607,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"her cloak and calash, and set out, though by a different path, on the"
5608,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,same errand.
5609,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5610,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,The night of the Saint was as dark and chill as the mysteries he was
5611,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"supposed to reveal, the moon throwing but a short occasional glance,"
5612,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,as the sluggish masses of cloud were driven slowly across her face.
5613,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,Thus it fell out that our two adventurers were quite unconscious of
5614,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"being in company, till a sudden glimpse of moonlight showed them to"
5615,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"each other, only a few yards apart; both, through a natural panic, as"
5616,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"pale as Ghosts, and both making eagerly towards the church porch. Much"
5617,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"as they had just wished for this vision, they could not help quaking"
5618,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"and stopping on the spot, as if turned to a pair of tombstones, and in"
5619,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"this position the dark again threw a sudden curtain over them, and they"
5620,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,disappeared from each other.
5621,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5622,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"It will be supposed the two came only to one conclusion, each"
5623,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,conceiving that St. Mark had marked the other to himself. With this
5624,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"comfortable knowledge, the widow and widower elect hied home again"
5625,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,by the roads they came; and as their custom was to sit apart after a
5626,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"quarrel, they repaired, each ignorant of the other’s excursion, to"
5627,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,separate chambers.
5628,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5629,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,[Illustration: SECOND SIGHT.]
5630,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5631,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"By-and-by, being called to supper, instead of sulking as aforetime,"
5632,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"they came down together, each being secretly in the best humour, though"
5633,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"mutually suspected of the worst: and amongst other things on the table,"
5634,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"there was a calf’s sweetbread, being one of those very dainties that"
5635,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"had often set them together by the ears. The Dame looked and longed,"
5636,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"but she refrained from its appropriation, thinking within herself that"
5637,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,she could give up sweetbreads _for one year_: and the Farmer made a
5638,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"similar reflection. After pushing the dish to and fro several times,"
5639,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"by a common impulse they divided the treat; and then having supped,"
5640,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"they retired amicably to rest, whereas until then, they had never gone"
5641,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"to bed without falling out. The truth was, each looked upon the other"
5642,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"as being already in the church-yard mould, or quite “moulded to their"
5643,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,wish.”
5644,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5645,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"On the morrow, which happened to be the Dame’s birthday, the Farmer was"
5646,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"the first to wake, and _knowing what he knew_, and having besides but"
5647,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,just roused himself out of a dream strictly confirmatory of the late
5648,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"vigil, he did not scruple to salute his wife, and wish her many happy"
5649,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"returns of the day. The wife, _who knew as much as he_, very readily"
5650,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"wished him the same, having in truth but just rubbed out of her eyes"
5651,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,the pattern of a widow’s bonnet that had been submitted to her in her
5652,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"sleep. She took care, however, to give the fowl’s liver at dinner to"
5653,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"the doomed man, considering that when he was dead and gone, she could"
5654,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"have them, if she pleased, seven days in the week; and the Farmer, on"
5655,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"his part, took care to help her to many tid-bits. Their feeling towards"
5656,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,each other was that of an impatient host with regard to an unwelcome
5657,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"guest, showing scarcely a bare civility while in expectation of his"
5658,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"stay, but overloading him with hospitality when made certain of his"
5659,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,departure.
5660,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5661,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"In this manner they went on for some six months, and though without"
5662,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"any addition of love between them, and as much selfishness as ever,"
5663,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,yet living in a subservience to the comforts and inclinations of each
5664,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"other, sometimes not to be found even amongst couples of sincerer"
5665,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"affections. There were as many causes for quarrel as ever, but every"
5666,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,day it became less worth while to quarrel; so letting by-gones be
5667,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"by-gones, they were indifferent to the present, and thought only of the"
5668,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"future, considering each other (to adopt a common phrase) “as _good_ as"
5669,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,dead.”
5670,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5671,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,[Illustration: “LET BY-GONES BE BY-GONES.”]
5672,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5673,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"Ten months wore away, and the Farmer’s birthday arrived in its turn."
5674,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"The Dame, who had passed an uncomfortable night, having dreamt, in"
5675,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"truth, that she did not much like herself in mourning, saluted him as"
5676,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"soon as the day dawned, and with a sigh wished him many years to come."
5677,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"The Farmer repaid her in kind, the sigh included; his own visions"
5678,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,having been of the painful sort for he had dreamt of having a headache
5679,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"from wearing a black hatband, and the malady still clung to him when"
5680,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,awake. The whole morning was spent in silent meditation and melancholy
5681,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"on both sides, and when dinner came, although the most favourite"
5682,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"dishes were upon the table, they could not eat. The Farmer, resting his"
5683,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"elbows upon the board, with his face between his hands, gazed wistfully"
5684,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"on his wife,--scooping her eyes, as it were, out of their sockets,"
5685,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"stripping the flesh off her cheeks, and in fancy converting her whole"
5686,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"head into a mere Caput Mortuum. The Dame, leaning back in her high"
5687,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"arm-chair, regarded the Yeoman quite as ruefully,--by the same process"
5688,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"of imagination picking his sturdy bones, and bleaching his ruddy visage"
5689,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,to the complexion of a plaster cast. Their minds travelling in the
5690,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"same direction, and at an equal rate, arrived together at the same"
5691,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,reflection; but the Farmer was the first to give it utterance:
5692,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5693,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"“Thee’d be missed, Dame, if thee were to die!”"
5694,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5695,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,The Dame started. Although she had nothing but Death at that moment
5696,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"before her eyes, she was far from dreaming of her own exit, and at"
5697,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"this rebound of her thoughts against herself, she felt as if an extra"
5698,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"cold coffin-plate had been suddenly nailed on her chest; recovering,"
5699,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"however, from the first shock, her thoughts flowed into their old"
5700,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"channel, and she retorted in the same spirit.--“I wish, Master, thee"
5701,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,may live so long as I!”
5702,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5703,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"The Farmer, in his own mind, wished to live rather longer; for, at the"
5704,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"utmost, he considered that his wife’s bill of mortality had but two"
5705,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,months to run. The calculation made him sorrowful; during the last
5706,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"few months she had consulted his appetite, bent to his humour, and"
5707,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"dove-tailed her own inclinations into his, in a manner that could never"
5708,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"be supplied; and he thought of her, if not in the language, at least in"
5709,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,the spirit of the Lady in Lalla Rookh--
5710,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5711,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,“I never taught a bright Gazelle
5712,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"To watch me with its dark black eye,"
5713,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"But when it came to know me well,"
5714,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"And love me, it was sure to die!”"
5715,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5716,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"His wife, from being at first useful to him, had become agreeable,"
5717,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"and at last dear; and as he contemplated her approaching fate, he"
5718,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"could not help thinking out audibly, “that he should be a lonesome"
5719,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"man when she was gone.” The Dame, this time, heard the survivorship"
5720,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,foreboded without starting; but she marveled much at what she thought
5721,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,the infatuation of a doomed man. So perfect was her faith in the
5722,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"infallibility of St. Mark, that she had even seen the symptoms of"
5723,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"mortal disease, as palpable as plague spots, on the devoted Yeoman."
5724,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"Giving his body up, therefore, for lost, a strong sense of duty"
5725,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"persuaded her, that it was imperative on her, as a Christian, to"
5726,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"warn the unsuspecting Farmer of his dissolution. Accordingly, with"
5727,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"a solemnity adapted to the subject, a tenderness of recent growth,"
5728,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"and a Memento Mori face, she broached the matter in the following"
5729,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"question--“Master, how bee’st?”"
5730,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5731,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"“As hearty, Dame, as a buck,”--the Dame shook her head,--“and I wish"
5732,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"thee the like,”--at which he shook his head himself."
5733,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5734,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,A dead silence ensued: the Farmer was as unprepared as ever. There
5735,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"is a great fancy for breaking the truth by dropping it gently,--an"
5736,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,experiment which has never answered any more than with Ironstone China.
5737,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"The Dame felt this, and thinking it better to throw the news at her"
5738,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"husband at once, she told him in as many words, that he was a dead man."
5739,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5740,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,It was now the Yeoman’s turn to be staggered. By a parallel course of
5741,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"reasoning, he had just wrought himself up to a similar disclosure,"
5742,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"and the Dame’s death-warrant was just ready upon his tongue, when he"
5743,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"met with his own despatch, signed, sealed and delivered. Conscience"
5744,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,instantly pointed out the oracle from which she had derived the
5745,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"omen, and he turned as pale as “the pale of society”--the colourless"
5746,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,complexion of late hours.
5747,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5748,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,St. Martin had numbered his years; and the remainder days seemed
5749,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"discounted by St. Thomas. Like a criminal cast to die, he doubted if"
5750,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"the die was cast, and appealed to his wife:--"
5751,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5752,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"“Thee hast watched, Dame, at the church porch, then?”"
5753,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5754,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"“Ay, Master.”"
5755,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5756,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,“And thee didst see me spirituously?”
5757,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5758,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"“In the brown wrap, with the boot hose. Thee were coming to the"
5759,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"church, by Fairthorn Gap; in the while I were coming by the Holly"
5760,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"Hedge”--For a minute the Farmer paused--but the next, he burst into a"
5761,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,fit of uncontrollable laughter; peal after peal--and each higher than
5762,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"the last,--according to the hysterical gamut of the hyæna. The poor"
5763,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,woman had but one explanation for this phenomenon--she thought it a
5764,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"delirium--a lightening before death, and was beginning to wring her"
5765,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"hands, and lament, when she was checked by the merry Yeoman:--"
5766,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5767,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"“Dame, thee bee’st a fool. It was I myself thee seed at the church"
5768,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"porch. I seed thee too,--with a notice to quit upon thy face--but,"
5769,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"thanks to God, thee bee’st a-living, and that is more than I cared to"
5770,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,say of thee this day ten-month!”
5771,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,
5772,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"The Dame made no answer. Her heart was too full to speak, but throwing"
5773,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"her arms round her husband, she showed that she shared in his"
5774,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"sentiment. And from that hour, by practising a careful abstinence from"
5775,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"offence, or a temperate sufferance of its appearance, they became the"
5776,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"most united couple in the county,--but it must be said, that their"
5777,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,"comfort was not complete till they had seen each other, in safety, over"
5778,A TALE OF THE OLDEN TIME.,the perilous anniversary of St. Mark’s Eve.

5969,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"Is a sort of stranded marine animal, that the receding tide of life has"
5970,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,left high and dry on the shore. He pines for his element like a Sea
5971,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"Bear, and misses his briny washings and wettings. What the ocean could"
5972,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"not do, the land does, for it makes him sick: he cannot digest properly"
5973,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,unless his body is rolled and tumbled about like a barrel-churn. Terra
5974,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"firma is good enough he thinks to touch at for wood and water, but"
5975,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"nothing more. There is no wind, he swears, ashore--every day of his"
5976,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"life is a dead calm,--a thing above all others he detests--he would"
5977,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"like it better for an occasional earthquake. Walk he cannot, the ground"
5978,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,being so still and steady that he is puzzled to keep his legs; and ride
5979,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"he will not, for he disdains a craft whose rudder is forward and not"
5980,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,astern.
5981,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,
5982,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,Inland scenery is his especial aversion. He despises a tree “before

5984,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"Boatswain’s whistle. He hates prospects, but enjoys retrospects."
5985,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"An old boat, a stray anchor, or decayed mooring ring, will set him"
5986,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,dreaming for hours. He splices sea and land ideas together. He reads
5987,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"of “shooting off a tie at Battersea,” and it reminds him of a ball"
5988,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"carrying away his own pigtail. “Canvassing for a situation,” recalls"
5989,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,running with all sails set for a station at Aboukir. He has the
5990,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"advantage of our Economists as to the “Standard of Value,” knowing it"
5991,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,to be the British ensign. The announcement of “an arrival of foreign
5992,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"vessels, with our ports open,” claps him into a Paradise of prize"
5993,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"money, with Poll of the _Pint_. He wonders sometimes at “petitions"
5994,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"to be discharged from the Fleet,” but sympathises with those in the"
5995,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"Marshalsea Court, as subject to a Sea Court Martial. Finally, try"
5996,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"him even in the learned languages, by asking him for the meaning of"
5997,A GREENWICH PENSIONER,"“Georgius Rex,” and he will answer, without hesitation, “The wrecks of"

6055,THE DILEMMA,
6056,THE DILEMMA,"The Portsmouth Rocket pulled up, and a middle-aged, domestic-looking"
6057,THE DILEMMA,"woman, just handsome enough for a plain cook at an ordinary, was"
6058,THE DILEMMA,"deposited on the dicky; two trunks, three bandboxes, a bundle, and a"
6059,THE DILEMMA,"hand-basket, were stowed in the hind boot. “This is where I’m to go"
6060,THE DILEMMA,"to,” she said to the guard, putting into his hand a slip of paper. The"
6061,THE DILEMMA,"guard took the paper, looked hard at it, right side upwards, then"
6062,THE DILEMMA,"upside down, and then he looked at the back; he in the mean time seemed"
6063,THE DILEMMA,to examine the consistency of the fabric between his finger and thumb;
6064,THE DILEMMA,he approached it to his nose as if to smell out its meaning; I even
6065,THE DILEMMA,"thought that he was going to try the sense of it by tasting, when by"
6066,THE DILEMMA,"a sudden jerk, he gave the label with its direction to the winds, and"
6067,THE DILEMMA,"snatching up his key-bugle began to play “Oh where, and oh where,” with"
6068,THE DILEMMA,all his breath.
6069,THE DILEMMA,
6070,THE DILEMMA,I defy the metaphysicians to explain by what vehicle I travelled to the
6071,THE DILEMMA,"conclusion that the guard could not read, but I felt as morally sure"
6072,THE DILEMMA,of it as if I had examined him in his a--b--ab. It was a prejudice not
6073,THE DILEMMA,"very liberal; but yet it clung to me, and fancy persisted in sticking a"
6074,THE DILEMMA,"dunce’s cap on his head. Shakspeare says that “he who runs may read,”"
6075,THE DILEMMA,and I had seen him run a good shilling’s worth after an umbrella that
6076,THE DILEMMA,dropped from the coach; it was a presumptuous opinion therefore to
6077,THE DILEMMA,"form, but I formed it notwithstanding--that he was a perfect stranger"
6078,THE DILEMMA,to all those booking-offices where the clerks are schoolmasters.
6079,THE DILEMMA,"Morally speaking, I had no earthly right to clap an ideal Saracen’s"
6080,THE DILEMMA,"Head on his shoulders; but, for the life of me, I could not persuade"
6081,THE DILEMMA,myself that he had more to do with literature than the Blue Boar.
6082,THE DILEMMA,
6083,THE DILEMMA,Women are naturally communicative: after a little while the female
6084,THE DILEMMA,"in the dicky brought up, as a military man would say, her reserve,"
6085,THE DILEMMA,and entered into recitative with the guard during the pauses of the
6086,THE DILEMMA,"key-bugle. She informed him in the course of conversation, or rather"
6087,THE DILEMMA,"dicky gossip, that she was an invaluable servant, and, as such,"
6088,THE DILEMMA,had been bequeathed by a deceased master to the care of one of his
6089,THE DILEMMA,"relatives at Putney, to exert her vigilance as a housekeeper, and"
6090,THE DILEMMA,"to overlook everything for fifty pounds a year. “Such places,” she"
6091,THE DILEMMA,"remarked, “is not to be found every day in the year.”"
6092,THE DILEMMA,
6093,THE DILEMMA,The last sentence was prophetic!
6094,THE DILEMMA,
6095,THE DILEMMA,"“If it’s Putney,” said the guard, “it’s the very place we’re going"
6096,THE DILEMMA,"through. Hold hard, Tom, the young woman wants to get down.” Tom"
6097,THE DILEMMA,"immediately pulled up; the young woman did get down, and her two"
6098,THE DILEMMA,"trunks, three bandboxes, her bundle, and her hand-basket, were"
6099,THE DILEMMA,"ranged round her. “I’ve had a very pleasant ride,” she said, giving"
6100,THE DILEMMA,"the fare with a smirk and a courtesy to the coachman, “and am very"
6101,THE DILEMMA,"much obliged,”--dropping a second courtesy to the guard,--“for other"
6102,THE DILEMMA,"civilities. The boxes and things is quite correct, and won’t give"
6103,THE DILEMMA,"further trouble, Mr. Guard, except to be as good as pint out the house"
6104,THE DILEMMA,"I’m going to.” The guard thus appealed to, for a moment stood all"
6105,THE DILEMMA,"aghast; but at last his wits came to his aid, and he gave the following"
6106,THE DILEMMA,lesson in geography.
6107,THE DILEMMA,
6108,THE DILEMMA,"“You’re all right--ourn a’n’t a short stage, and can’t go round setting"
6109,THE DILEMMA,people down at their own doors; but you’re safe enough at Putney--don’t
6110,THE DILEMMA,"be alarmed, my dear--you can’t go out of it. It’s all Putney, from the"
6111,THE DILEMMA,"bridge we’ve just come over, to that windmill you almost can’t see"
6112,THE DILEMMA,t’other side of the common.”
6113,THE DILEMMA,
6114,THE DILEMMA,"“But, Mr. Guard, I’ve never been in Putney before, and it seems a"
6115,THE DILEMMA,scrambling sort of a place. If the coach can’t go round with me to the
6116,THE DILEMMA,"house, can’t you stretch a pint and set me down in sight of it?”"
6117,THE DILEMMA,
6118,THE DILEMMA,“It’s impossible--that’s the sum total; this coach is timed to a
6119,THE DILEMMA,"minute, and can’t do more for outsides if they was all kings of"
6120,THE DILEMMA,England.”
6121,THE DILEMMA,
6122,THE DILEMMA,"“I see how it is,” said the female, bridling up, while the coachman,"
6123,THE DILEMMA,"out of patience, prepared to do quite the reverse; “some people are"
6124,THE DILEMMA,"very civil, while some people are setting beside ’em in dickies; but"
6125,THE DILEMMA,"give me the paper again, and I’ll find my own ways.”"
6126,THE DILEMMA,
6127,THE DILEMMA,"“It’s chucked away,” said the guard as the coach got into motion; “but"
6128,THE DILEMMA,just ask the first man you meet--anybody will tell you.”
6129,THE DILEMMA,
6130,THE DILEMMA,"“But I don’t know who or where to ask for,” screamed the lost woman"
6131,THE DILEMMA,after the flying Rocket; “I can’t read; but it was all down in the
6132,THE DILEMMA,paper as is chucked away.”
6133,THE DILEMMA,
6134,THE DILEMMA,A loud flourish of the bugle to the tune of “My Lodging is on the Cold

6199,THE DISCOVERY.,"“It’s a nasty evening,” said Mr. Dornton, the stockbroker, as he"
6200,THE DISCOVERY.,"settled himself in the last inside place of the last Fulham coach,"
6201,THE DISCOVERY.,"driven by our old friend Mat--an especial friend in need, be it"
6202,THE DISCOVERY.,"remembered, to the fair sex."
6203,THE DISCOVERY.,
6204,THE DISCOVERY.,"“I wouldn’t be outside,” said Mr. Jones, another stockbroker, “for a"
6205,THE DISCOVERY.,trifle.”
6206,THE DISCOVERY.,
6207,THE DISCOVERY.,"“Nor I, as a speculation in options,” said Mr. Parsons, another"
6208,THE DISCOVERY.,frequenter of the Alley.
6209,THE DISCOVERY.,
6210,THE DISCOVERY.,"“I wonder what Mat is waiting for,” said Mr. Tidwell, “for we are full"
6211,THE DISCOVERY.,inside and out.”
6212,THE DISCOVERY.,
6213,THE DISCOVERY.,"Mr. Tidwell’s doubt was soon solved,--the coach-door opened and Mat"
6214,THE DISCOVERY.,"somewhat ostentatiously enquired, what indeed he very well knew--“I"
6215,THE DISCOVERY.,believe every place is took up inside?”
6216,THE DISCOVERY.,
6217,THE DISCOVERY.,"“We’re all here,” answered Mr. Jones, on behalf of the usual complement"
6218,THE DISCOVERY.,of old stagers.
6219,THE DISCOVERY.,
6220,THE DISCOVERY.,"“I told you so, Ma’am,” said Mat, to a female who stood beside him,"
6221,THE DISCOVERY.,"but still leaving the door open to an invitation from within. However,"
6222,THE DISCOVERY.,"nobody spoke--on the contrary, I felt Mr. Hindmarsh, my next neighbour,"
6223,THE DISCOVERY.,dilating himself like the frog in the fable.
6224,THE DISCOVERY.,
6225,THE DISCOVERY.,"“I don’t know what I shall do,” exclaimed the woman; “I’ve nowhere to"
6226,THE DISCOVERY.,"go to, and it’s raining cats and dogs!”"
6227,THE DISCOVERY.,
6228,THE DISCOVERY.,"“You’d better not hang about, anyhow,” said Mat, “for you may ketch your"
6229,THE DISCOVERY.,"death,--and I’m the last coach,--aint I, Mr. Jones?”"
6230,THE DISCOVERY.,
6231,THE DISCOVERY.,"“To be sure you are,” said Mr. Jones, rather impatiently; “shut the"
6232,THE DISCOVERY.,door.”
6233,THE DISCOVERY.,
6234,THE DISCOVERY.,"“I told the lady the gentlemen couldn’t make room for her,” answered"
6235,THE DISCOVERY.,"Mat, in a tone of apology,--“I’m very sorry, my dear” (turning towards"
6236,THE DISCOVERY.,"the female), “you should have _my_ seat, if you could hold the"
6237,THE DISCOVERY.,ribbons--but such a pretty one as you ought to have a coach of her own.”
6238,THE DISCOVERY.,
6239,THE DISCOVERY.,He began slowly closing the door.
6240,THE DISCOVERY.,
6241,THE DISCOVERY.,"“Stop, Mat, stop!” cried Mr. Dornton, and the door quickly unclosed"
6242,THE DISCOVERY.,again; “I can’t give up my place for I’m expected home to dinner; but
6243,THE DISCOVERY.,if the lady wouldn’t object to sit on my knees----”
6244,THE DISCOVERY.,
6245,THE DISCOVERY.,"“Not the least in the world,” answered Mat, eagerly; “you won’t object,"
6246,THE DISCOVERY.,"will you, Ma’am, for once in a way, with a married gentleman, and a wet"
6247,THE DISCOVERY.,"night, and the last coach on the road?”"
6248,THE DISCOVERY.,
6249,THE DISCOVERY.,"“If I thought I shouldn’t uncommode,” said the lady, precipitately"
6250,THE DISCOVERY.,"furling her wet umbrella, which she handed in to one gentleman, whilst"
6251,THE DISCOVERY.,"she favoured another with her muddy pattens. She then followed herself,"
6252,THE DISCOVERY.,"Mat shutting the door behind her, in such a manner as to help her in."
6253,THE DISCOVERY.,"“I’m sure I’m obliged for the favour,” she said, looking round; “but"
6254,THE DISCOVERY.,which gentleman was so kind?”
6255,THE DISCOVERY.,
6256,THE DISCOVERY.,"“It was I who had the pleasure of proposing, Madam,” said Mr. Dornton;"
6257,THE DISCOVERY.,"and before he pronounced the last word she was in his lap, with an"
6258,THE DISCOVERY.,assurance that she would sit as lightsome as she could. Both parties
6259,THE DISCOVERY.,seemed very well pleased with the arrangement; but to judge according
6260,THE DISCOVERY.,"to the rules of Lavater, the rest of the company were but ill at ease."
6261,THE DISCOVERY.,"For my own part, I candidly confess I was equally out of humour with"
6262,THE DISCOVERY.,"myself and the person who had set me such an example of gallantry. I,"
6263,THE DISCOVERY.,who had read the lays of the Troubadours--the awards of the old “Courts
6264,THE DISCOVERY.,"of Love,”--the lives of the “preux Chevaliers”--the history of Sir"
6265,THE DISCOVERY.,Charles Grandison--to be outdone in courtesy to the sex by a married
6266,THE DISCOVERY.,stockbroker! How I grudged him the honour she conferred upon him--how I
6267,THE DISCOVERY.,envied his feelings!
6268,THE DISCOVERY.,
6269,THE DISCOVERY.,"I did not stand alone, I suspect, in this unjustifiable jealousy."
6270,THE DISCOVERY.,"Messrs. Jones, Hindmarsh, Tidwell, and Parsons, seemed equally"
6271,THE DISCOVERY.,"disinclined to forgive the chivalrous act which had, as true knights,"
6272,THE DISCOVERY.,"lowered all our crests and blotted our scutcheons, and cut off our"
6273,THE DISCOVERY.,"spurs. Many an unfair gibe was launched at the champion of the fair,"
6274,THE DISCOVERY.,"and when he attempted to enter into conversation with the lady, he"
6275,THE DISCOVERY.,was interrupted by incessant questions of “What is stirring in the
6276,THE DISCOVERY.,Alley?”--“What is doing in Dutch?”--“How are the Rentes?”
6277,THE DISCOVERY.,
6278,THE DISCOVERY.,To all these questions Mr. Dornton incontinently returned business-like
6279,THE DISCOVERY.,"answers, according to the last Stock Exchange quotations; and he was in"
6280,THE DISCOVERY.,"the middle of an elaborate enumeration, that so and so was very firm,"
6281,THE DISCOVERY.,"and so and so very low, and this rather brisk, and that getting up,"
6282,THE DISCOVERY.,"and operations, and fluctuations, and so forth, when somebody enquired"
6283,THE DISCOVERY.,about Spanish Bonds.
6284,THE DISCOVERY.,
6285,THE DISCOVERY.,"“They are looking up, _my dear_,” answered Mr. Dornton, somewhat"
6286,THE DISCOVERY.,abstractedly; and before the other stockbrokers had done tittering the
6287,THE DISCOVERY.,"stage stopped. A bell was rung, and whilst Mat stood beside the open"
6288,THE DISCOVERY.,"coach-door, a staid female in a calash and clogs, with a lantern in her"
6289,THE DISCOVERY.,"hand, came clattering pompously down a front garden."
6290,THE DISCOVERY.,
6291,THE DISCOVERY.,“Is Susan Pegge come?” enquired a shrill voice.
6292,THE DISCOVERY.,
6293,THE DISCOVERY.,"“Yes, I be,” replied the lady who had been dry nursed from town;--“are"
6294,THE DISCOVERY.,"you, Ma’am, number ten, Grove Place?”"
6295,THE DISCOVERY.,
6296,THE DISCOVERY.,"“This is Mr. Dornton’s,” said the dignified woman in the hood advancing"
6297,THE DISCOVERY.,"her lantern,--“and--mercy on us! you’re in master’s lap!”"
6298,THE DISCOVERY.,
6299,THE DISCOVERY.,A shout of laughter from five of the inside passengers corroborated the
6300,THE DISCOVERY.,"assertion, and like a literal cat out of the bag, the ci-devant lady,"
6301,THE DISCOVERY.,"forgetting her umbrella and her pattens, bolted out of the coach, and"
6302,THE DISCOVERY.,"with feline celerity rushed up the garden, and down the area, of number"
6303,THE DISCOVERY.,ten.
6304,THE DISCOVERY.,
6305,THE DISCOVERY.,"“Renounce the woman!” said Dr. Dornton, as he scuttled out of the"
6306,THE DISCOVERY.,stage--“Why the devil didn’t she tell me she was the new cook?”

6320,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,
6321,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"It was July the First, and the great hill of Howth"
6322,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"Was bearing by compass sow-west and by south,"
6323,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"And the name of the ship was the Peggy of Cork,"
6324,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,Well freighted with bacon and butter and pork.
6325,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"Now, this ship had a captain, Macmorris by name,"
6326,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,And little O’Patrick was mate of the same;
6327,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"For Bristol they sailed, but by nautical scope,"
6328,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,They contrived to be lost by the Cape of Good Hope.
6329,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"Of all the Cork boys that the vessel could boast,"
6330,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,Only little O’P. made a swim to the coast;
6331,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"And when he revived from a sort of a trance,"
6332,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,He saw a big Black with a very long lance.
6333,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"Says the savage, says he, in some Hottentot tongue,"
6334,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,“Bash Kuku my gimmel bo gumborry bung!”
6335,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"Then blew a long shell, to the fright of our elf,"
6336,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,And down came a hundred as black as himself.
6337,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"They brought with them _guattul_, and pieces of _klam_,"
6338,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"The first was like beef, and the second like lamb;"
6339,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"“Don’t I know,” said O’P., “what the wretches are at?"
6340,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,They’re intending to eat me as soon as I’m fat!”
6341,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"In terror of coming to pan, spit, or pot,"
6342,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,His rations of _jarbul_ he suffer’d to rot;
6343,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"He would not touch _purry_ or _doolberry-lik_,"
6344,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,But kept himself _growing_ as thin as a stick.
6345,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"Though broiling the climate, and parching with drouth,"
6346,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"He would not let _chobbery_ enter his mouth,"
6347,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"But kicked down the _krug_ shell, tho’ sweetened with _natt_,--"
6348,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,“I an’t to be pisoned the likes of a rat!”
6349,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"At last the great _Joddry_ got quite in a rage,"
6350,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"And cried, “O mi pitticum dambally nage!"
6351,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"The _chobbery_ take, and put back on the shelf,"
6352,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"Or give me the _krug_ shell, I’ll drink it myself!"
6353,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"The _doolberry-lik_ is the best to be had,"
6354,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,And the _purry_ (I chew’d it myself) is not bad;
6355,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"The _jarbul_ is fresh, for I saw it cut out,"
6356,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,And the _Bok_ that it came from is grazing about.
6357,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"My _jumbo_! but run off to Billery Nang,"
6358,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"And tell her to put on her _jigger_ and _tang_,"
6359,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"And go with the _Bloss_ to the man of the sea,"
6360,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,And say that she comes as his _Wulwul_ from me.”
6361,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"Now Billery Nang was as Black as a sweep,"
6362,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"With thick curly hair like the wool of a sheep,"
6363,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"And the moment he spied her, said little O’P.,"
6364,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"“Sure the Divil is dead, and his Widow’s at me!”"
6365,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"But when, in the blaze of her Hottentot charms,"
6366,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"She came to accept him for life in her arms,"
6367,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"And stretched her thick lips to a broad grin of love,"
6368,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"A Raven preparing to bill like a Dove,"
6369,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"With a soul full of dread he declined the grim bliss,"
6370,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"Stopped her Molyneux arms, and eluded her kiss;"
6371,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"At last, fairly foiled, she gave up the attack,"
6372,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,And _Joddry_ began to look blacker than black;
6373,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,“By Mumbo! by Jumbo!--why here is a man
6374,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"That won’t be made happy, do all that I can;"
6375,LITTLE O’P.--AN AFRICAN FACT.,"He will not be married, lodged, clad, and well fed,"

6381,THE DEBUTANTE.,THE DEBUTANTE.
6382,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6383,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6384,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“Inside or out, Ma’am?” asked the coachman, as he stood civilly with"
6385,THE DEBUTANTE.,the door in his hand.
6386,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6387,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“If you please, I’ll try _in_ first,” answered the woman, poking in"
6388,THE DEBUTANTE.,"an umbrella before her, and then a pair of pattens--“I’m not used to"
6389,THE DEBUTANTE.,"coaching, and don’t think I could keep myself on the top.”"
6390,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6391,THE DEBUTANTE.,"In she came, and after some floundering, having first tried two"
6392,THE DEBUTANTE.,"gentlemen’s laps, she found herself in the centre of the front seat,"
6393,THE DEBUTANTE.,"where she composed herself, with something of the air of a Catherine"
6394,THE DEBUTANTE.,"Hayes, getting into a sledge for a trip to Tyburn. Except for her"
6395,THE DEBUTANTE.,"fear, which literally made a fright of her, I should have called her"
6396,THE DEBUTANTE.,"a pretty-looking woman,--but the faces she pulled were horrible. As"
6397,THE DEBUTANTE.,"the cad enclosed her luggage in the hind-boot with a smart slam,"
6398,THE DEBUTANTE.,her features underwent an actual spasm; and I heard her whisper to
6399,THE DEBUTANTE.,"herself, “somethink broke.” As she spoke thus, she started on her feet,"
6400,THE DEBUTANTE.,"and the horses doing the same thing at the same moment, the timid"
6401,THE DEBUTANTE.,"female found herself suddenly hugging the strange gentleman opposite,"
6402,THE DEBUTANTE.,"for which she excused herself by saying, “she wasn’t accustomed to be"
6403,THE DEBUTANTE.,so carried away.”
6404,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6405,THE DEBUTANTE.,"Down she plumped again in her old place, but her physiognomy didn’t"
6406,THE DEBUTANTE.,"improve. She seemed in torture, as if broken, not upon one wheel, but"
6407,THE DEBUTANTE.,"upon four. Her eyes rolled, her eyebrows worked up and down, as if"
6408,THE DEBUTANTE.,"trying to pump out tears that wouldn’t come,--her lips kept going like"
6409,THE DEBUTANTE.,"a rabbit’s, though she had nothing to eat, and I fancied I could hear"
6410,THE DEBUTANTE.,"her grinding her teeth. Her hands, meanwhile, convulsively grasped"
6411,THE DEBUTANTE.,"a bundle on her lap, till something like orange-juice squeezed out"
6412,THE DEBUTANTE.,"between her fingers. When the coach went on one side, she clutched"
6413,THE DEBUTANTE.,"the arm of whichever of her neighbours sat highest, and at a _pinch_"
6414,THE DEBUTANTE.,"she laid hold of both. At last she suddenly turned pale, and somewhat"
6415,THE DEBUTANTE.,hastily I suggested that she perhaps did not prefer to ride backwards.
6416,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6417,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“If it’s all the same to _you_, Sir, I should really be glad to change"
6418,THE DEBUTANTE.,seats.”
6419,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6420,THE DEBUTANTE.,"The removal was effected, not without some difficulty, for she"
6421,THE DEBUTANTE.,"contrived to tread on all our feet, and hang on all our necks, before"
6422,THE DEBUTANTE.,"she could subside. It was managed, however, and there we sat again,"
6423,THE DEBUTANTE.,"vis-a-vis, if such a phrase may be used where one visage was opposed to"
6424,THE DEBUTANTE.,"visages innumerable; for if her face was her fortune, she screwed as"
6425,THE DEBUTANTE.,"much out of it as she could. She hardly needed to speak, but she did so"
6426,THE DEBUTANTE.,after a short interval.
6427,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6428,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“I hope you’ll excuse, but I can’t ride forrards neither.”"
6429,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6430,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“The air’s what you wan’t Ma’am,” said a stout gentleman in the corner."
6431,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6432,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“Yes, I think that _would_ revive me,” said the female, with what the"
6433,THE DEBUTANTE.,"musicians call a veiled voice, through her handkerchief."
6434,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6435,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“Let the lady out!” squealed a little man, who sat on her left,"
6436,THE DEBUTANTE.,"whilst a stout gentleman on her right, after looking in vain for a"
6437,THE DEBUTANTE.,"check-string, gave a pull at the corner of the skirt of a great-coat"
6438,THE DEBUTANTE.,"that hung over the window, almost pulling the owner off the roof. The"
6439,THE DEBUTANTE.,Chronometer stopped.
6440,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6441,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“It’s the lady,” said the little man to the coachman, as the latter"
6442,THE DEBUTANTE.,appeared at the door; “she wants to be inside out.”
6443,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6444,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“It’s as the gentleman says,” added the female; “I an’t quite myself,"
6445,THE DEBUTANTE.,"but I don’t want to affect the fare. You shan’t be any loser, for I’ll"
6446,THE DEBUTANTE.,discharge in full.”
6447,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6448,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“There’s the whole dicky to yourself, Ma’am,” said the coachman, with"
6449,THE DEBUTANTE.,"something like a wink, and after some scuffling and scrambling, we felt"
6450,THE DEBUTANTE.,her seating herself on the “backgammon board” as if she never meant to
6451,THE DEBUTANTE.,be taken up.
6452,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6453,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“It seems ungallant,” said the little man, as we got into motion again;"
6454,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“but I think women oughtn’t to travel, particularly in what are called"
6455,THE DEBUTANTE.,"short stages, for they’re certain to make them long ones. First of all,"
6456,THE DEBUTANTE.,"they have been told to make sure of the right coach, and they spell it"
6457,THE DEBUTANTE.,"all over, from ‘Horne and Co.’ and ‘licensed to carry,’ to No. nine"
6458,THE DEBUTANTE.,"thousand, fourteen hundred and nine. Then they never believe the cads."
6459,THE DEBUTANTE.,"If one cries ‘Hackney,’ they say ‘that means Camberwell, and I’ve had"
6460,THE DEBUTANTE.,enough of getting into wrong stages.’ Then they have to ascertain it’s
6461,THE DEBUTANTE.,"the first coach, and when it will start exactly, and when they’re"
6462,THE DEBUTANTE.,"sure of both points, they’re to be hunted for in a pastry-cook’s"
6463,THE DEBUTANTE.,"shop, and out of that into a fruiterer’s. At last you think you have"
6464,THE DEBUTANTE.,’em--but no such thing. All the luggage is to be put in under their
6465,THE DEBUTANTE.,"own eyes--there’s a wrangle, of course, about that,--and when they’re"
6466,THE DEBUTANTE.,"all ready, with one foot on the step, they’ve been told to make their"
6467,THE DEBUTANTE.,bargain with the coachman before they get in.”
6468,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6469,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“My own mother to a T,” exclaimed the fat man; “she agreed with a"
6470,THE DEBUTANTE.,"fly-man, at Brighton, to convey her to the Devil’s Dyke for twelve"
6471,THE DEBUTANTE.,"shillings; but when it came to setting off, she couldn’t resist the"
6472,THE DEBUTANTE.,"spirit of haggling. Says she, ‘What’ll you take me to the Devil for,"
6473,THE DEBUTANTE.,without the Dyke?’”
6474,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6475,THE DEBUTANTE.,A loud scream interrupted any further illustration of female
6476,THE DEBUTANTE.,"travelling, and again the Chronometer stopped, losing at the rate of"
6477,THE DEBUTANTE.,"ten miles in the hour. We all had a shrewd guess at the cause, but"
6478,THE DEBUTANTE.,the little man nevertheless thought proper to pop his little head out
6479,THE DEBUTANTE.,"of the window, and enquire with a big voice “What the plague we were"
6480,THE DEBUTANTE.,stopping for?”
6481,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6482,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“It’s the _lady_ agin, Sir,” said the coachman, in a dissatisfied tone."
6483,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“She says the dicky shakes so, she’s sure it will come off: but it’s"
6484,THE DEBUTANTE.,all right now--I’ve got her in front.”
6485,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6486,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“It’s very well,” said the little man, “but if I travel with a woman"
6487,THE DEBUTANTE.,again in a stage----”
6488,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6489,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“Poo! poo!--consider your own wife,” said the stout man; “women can’t"
6490,THE DEBUTANTE.,be stuck in garden-pots and tied to sticks; they must come up to London
6491,THE DEBUTANTE.,now and then. She’ll be very comfortable in front.”
6492,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6493,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“I wish she may,” said the little man, rather tartly, “but it’s hard to"
6494,THE DEBUTANTE.,"suit the sex;”--and, as if to confirm the sentence, the coach, after"
6495,THE DEBUTANTE.,"proceeding about a mile, came again to a full stop."
6496,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6497,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“I’m very sorry, gentlemen,” said the coachman, with a touch of his"
6498,THE DEBUTANTE.,"hat, as be looked in at the window, “but she won’t do in front!”"
6499,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6500,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“Just like ’em!” muttered the little man, “the devil himself can’t"
6501,THE DEBUTANTE.,please a woman.”
6502,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6503,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“I should think,” suggested the stout man, “if you were to give her the"
6504,THE DEBUTANTE.,"box seat, with your arm well round her waist.”"
6505,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6506,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“No, I’ve tried that,” said the coachman, shaking his head; “it did"
6507,THE DEBUTANTE.,"pretty well over the level, but we’re coming on a hill, and she can’t"
6508,THE DEBUTANTE.,face it.”
6509,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6510,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“Set her down at once, bag and baggage,” said the little man; “I’ve an"
6511,THE DEBUTANTE.,appointment at one.”
6512,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6513,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“And for my part,” said a gentleman in black, “if there’s any delay, I"
6514,THE DEBUTANTE.,give you legal notice I shall hire a chaise at the expense of the coach
6515,THE DEBUTANTE.,proprietors.”
6516,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6517,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“That’s just it, curse her,” said the perplexed coachman, deliberately"
6518,THE DEBUTANTE.,"taking off his hat, that he might have a scratch at his head; “she’s"
6519,THE DEBUTANTE.,"had her pick, outside and in, back and front, and it’s no use of course"
6520,THE DEBUTANTE.,to propose to her to sit astride on the pole.”
6521,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6522,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“Oh Eve! Eve! Eve!” exclaimed the little man, who seemed to owe the sex"
6523,THE DEBUTANTE.,some peculiar grudge.
6524,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6525,THE DEBUTANTE.,The man in black looked at his watch.
6526,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6527,THE DEBUTANTE.,"The coachman pulled out a handful of silver, and began to count out a"
6528,THE DEBUTANTE.,"portion, preparatory to offering to return the woman her fare if she"
6529,THE DEBUTANTE.,would get down--when a cheering voice hailed him from above.
6530,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6531,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“It’s all right, Tom--jump up--the lady’s creeping into the boot.”"
6532,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6533,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“She won’t like that, I guess,” muttered Tom to himself, but in a"
6534,THE DEBUTANTE.,"second the money jingled back into his pocket, and he was on his box"
6535,THE DEBUTANTE.,in the twinkling of an eye. Away went the coach over the brow of the
6536,THE DEBUTANTE.,"hill, and began to spin down the descent with an impetus increasing at"
6537,THE DEBUTANTE.,every yard. The wheels rattled--the chains jingled--the horse-shoes
6538,THE DEBUTANTE.,clattered--and the maid in the boot shrieked like a maid in Bedlam.
6539,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6540,THE DEBUTANTE.,“Poor thing!” ejaculated the stout gentleman.
6541,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6542,THE DEBUTANTE.,The little man grinned--villanously like an ape.
6543,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6544,THE DEBUTANTE.,The man in black pretended to be asleep.
6545,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6546,THE DEBUTANTE.,"Meanwhile her screams increased in volume, and ascended in"
6547,THE DEBUTANTE.,pitch--interrupted only by an occasional “oh Lord!” and equivalent
6548,THE DEBUTANTE.,ejaculations. It was piteous to hear her; but there was no help for it.
6549,THE DEBUTANTE.,"To stop the coach was impossible; it had pressed upon the horses till,"
6550,THE DEBUTANTE.,"in spite of all the coachman’s exertions, they broke into a gallop, and"
6551,THE DEBUTANTE.,it required his utmost efforts to keep them together. An attempt to
6552,THE DEBUTANTE.,"pull up would have upset us, as sure as fate; luckily for us all Tom"
6553,THE DEBUTANTE.,"did not make the experiment, and the Chronometer, after running down"
6554,THE DEBUTANTE.,"one hill and half way up another, was stopped without accident."
6555,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6556,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“How’s the lady?” asked the stout man, anxiously thrusting his head and"
6557,THE DEBUTANTE.,"shoulders out at one window, whilst I acted the same part at the other;"
6558,THE DEBUTANTE.,"and, as the sufferer got down on my side of the coach, my curiosity was"
6559,THE DEBUTANTE.,first gratified. Never was figure more forlorn: her face was as pale as
6560,THE DEBUTANTE.,"ashes, and her hair hung about it in all directions through heat and"
6561,THE DEBUTANTE.,"fright--her eyes as crazy as her hair, and her mouth wide open."
6562,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6563,THE DEBUTANTE.,“How’s the lady?” repeated the stout gentleman.
6564,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6565,THE DEBUTANTE.,"As for her straw bonnet, it was like Milton’s Death, of no particular"
6566,THE DEBUTANTE.,"shape at all, flat where it should have been full, square where it"
6567,THE DEBUTANTE.,"ought to have been round, turned up instead of down, and down instead"
6568,THE DEBUTANTE.,of up--it had as many corners and nubbles about it as a crusty loaf.
6569,THE DEBUTANTE.,"Her shawl or scarf had twisted round and round her like a snake, and"
6570,THE DEBUTANTE.,her pelisse showed as ruffled and rumpled and all awry as if she had
6571,THE DEBUTANTE.,just rolled down Greenwich Hill.
6572,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6573,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“How’s the lady? I say,” bellowed the big man."
6574,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6575,THE DEBUTANTE.,"One of her shoes had preferred to remain with the boot, and as the road"
6576,THE DEBUTANTE.,"was muddy, she stood like a Numidian crane, posturing and balancing on"
6577,THE DEBUTANTE.,"one leg; whilst Tom, hunting after the missing article, which declined"
6578,THE DEBUTANTE.,to turn up till everything else had been taken out of “the leathern
6579,THE DEBUTANTE.,"conveniency,” and as it was one of the old-fashioned boots it held"
6580,THE DEBUTANTE.,plenty of luggage.
6581,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6582,THE DEBUTANTE.,“How is the lady?” was shouted again with no better success.
6583,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6584,THE DEBUTANTE.,It was evident she had not escaped with the fright merely; her hands
6585,THE DEBUTANTE.,"wandered from her ribs to the small of her back, and then she rubbed"
6586,THE DEBUTANTE.,"each knee. It was some time before she could fetch her breath freely,"
6587,THE DEBUTANTE.,but at last she mustered enough for a short exclamation.
6588,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6589,THE DEBUTANTE.,“Oh them trunks!”
6590,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6591,THE DEBUTANTE.,“How’s the lady?” shouted the fat man for the last time; for finding
6592,THE DEBUTANTE.,"that it obtained no answer, he opened the door and bolted out, just"
6593,THE DEBUTANTE.,"in time to have the gratification of putting on the woman’s one shoe,"
6594,THE DEBUTANTE.,whilst she clung with both her arms round his short neck.
6595,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6596,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“There, my dear,” he said with a finishing slap on the sole. “Bless my"
6597,THE DEBUTANTE.,"heart, though, it’s a distressing situation! Coachman, how far is she"
6598,THE DEBUTANTE.,from London?”
6599,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6600,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“A good nine mile,” answered Tom."
6601,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6602,THE DEBUTANTE.,“Gracious Heaven!” exclaimed the stout man. “She can’t _do_ it!”
6603,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6604,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“It’s only nine mile,” said the woman, with a sort of hysterical"
6605,THE DEBUTANTE.,giggle;--“and I’m fond of walking.”
6606,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6607,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“Give her her luggage, then, at once,” cried the little man from the"
6608,THE DEBUTANTE.,coach. The dark man held out his watch. A passenger on the top swore
6609,THE DEBUTANTE.,"horribly, and threatened to get down, and Tom himself, as well as his"
6610,THE DEBUTANTE.,"horses, were on the fret."
6611,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6612,THE DEBUTANTE.,"“There is no remedy,” sighed the fat man, as he resumed his old seat in"
6613,THE DEBUTANTE.,the corner of the coach. The whip smacked--I leaned out for a parting
6614,THE DEBUTANTE.,look.
6615,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6616,THE DEBUTANTE.,"There she stood nursing three bundles, each as big as a baby, and as we"
6617,THE DEBUTANTE.,rolled off I heard her last words in this soliloquy:
6618,THE DEBUTANTE.,
6619,THE DEBUTANTE.,“How _ham_ I to _hever_ to get to York by the mail?”

6713,POPPING THE QUESTION.,
6714,POPPING THE QUESTION.,My friend Walker is a great story-teller. He reminds me of the
6715,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"professional tale-bearers in the East, who, without being particularly"
6716,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"requested by the company, begin reciting the adventures of Sinbad, or"
6717,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"the life, death, and resurrection of Little Hunchback. No sooner does"
6718,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"conversation flag for a few minutes, than W. strikes up, with some such"
6719,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"prelude as, “I told you about the Flying Fish affair before,--but as"
6720,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"you wish me to refresh your memory, you shall have it again.” He then"
6721,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"deliberately fills his glass, and furnishes himself with a cork, a bit"
6722,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"of orange-peel, or an apple-paring, to be shredded and sub-shredded"
6723,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"during the course of narration. Many Scotchmen, by-the-way, and most"
6724,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"Canadians, are given to the same manual propensity. A lady located"
6725,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"towards the Back Settlements informed me, that at a party she gave, the"
6726,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"mantelshelf, chairs, tables, and every wooden article of furniture, was"
6727,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"nicked and notched by the knives of her guests, like the tallies of"
6728,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"our Exchequer. It is most probably an Indian peculiarity, and derived"
6729,POPPING THE QUESTION.,by intercourse or intermixture with the Chipaways--but to return to W.
6730,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"The other day, after dinner, with a select few of my friends, there"
6731,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"occurred one of those sudden silences, those verbal armistices, or"
6732,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"suspensions of words, which frequently provoke at irresistible allusion"
6733,POPPING THE QUESTION.,to a Quaker’s meeting. Of this pause W. of course availed himself.

6735,POPPING THE QUESTION.,[Illustration: FISHING--A RISE.]
6736,POPPING THE QUESTION.,
6737,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"“You were going, Sir,” addressing the gentleman opposite, “to ask me"
6738,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"about the Pop business,--but I ought first to tell you how I came to be"
6739,POPPING THE QUESTION.,carrying ginger-beer in my pocket.”
6740,POPPING THE QUESTION.,
6741,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"The gentleman thus appealed to, a straightforward old drysalter, who"
6742,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"had never seen W. in his life before, naturally stared at such a bold"
6743,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"anticipation of his thoughts; but before he could find words to reply,"
6744,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"W. had helped himself to a dozen almonds, which he began mincing, while"
6745,POPPING THE QUESTION.,he set off at a steady pace in his story.
6746,POPPING THE QUESTION.,
6747,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"“The way I came to have ginger-beer in my pocket, was this. I don’t"
6748,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"know whether you are acquainted with Hopkins, Sir, of the Queen’s"
6749,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"Arms in the Poultry,” the drysalter shook his head; “it’s the house"
6750,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"I frequent, and a very civil obliging sort of fellow he is--that is"
6751,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"to say, was, two summers ago. The season was very sultry, and says I,"
6752,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"Hopkins, I wonder you don’t keep ginger pop--it’s a pleasant refreshing"
6753,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"beverage at this season, and particularly wholesome. Well, Hopkins"
6754,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"was very thankful for the hint, for he likes to have everything that"
6755,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"can be called for, and he was for sending off an order at once to the"
6756,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"ginger-beer manufactory, but I persuaded him better. None of their"
6757,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"wholesale trash, said I, but make your own. I’ll give you a recipe for"
6758,POPPING THE QUESTION.,it--the best ever bottled. But I couldn’t gain my point. Hopkins hum’d
6759,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"and haw’d, and thought nobody could make it but the makers. There was"
6760,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"no setting him right, so at last I determined to put him to the proof."
6761,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"I’ll tell you what, Hopkins, said I, you don’t like the trouble, or I’d"
6762,POPPING THE QUESTION.,soon convince you that a man who isn’t a maker can make it as well as
6763,POPPING THE QUESTION.,anyone--perhaps better. You shall have a sample of mine--I’ve got a few
6764,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"bottles at my counting-house, and it’s only a step. Of course, Hopkins"
6765,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"was very much obliged, and off I went. In confidence between you and"
6766,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"me, Sir,--though I never had the pleasure of seeing you before--I"
6767,POPPING THE QUESTION.,wanted to introduce ginger-beer at the Queen’s Arms as a public
6768,POPPING THE QUESTION.,benefit.”
6769,POPPING THE QUESTION.,
6770,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"“I am sure, Sir--I’m very much obliged,” stammered the drysalter, at a"
6771,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"loss what to say. “Ginger-beer, I’ve no doubt, is very efficacious, and"
6772,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"particularly after fruit or lobsters, for I observe you always see them"
6773,POPPING THE QUESTION.,at the same shops.”
6774,POPPING THE QUESTION.,
6775,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"“The best drink in the dog-days all to nothing,” returned W., “but"
6776,POPPING THE QUESTION.,ought to be amazingly well corked and wired down--and I’ll tell you
6777,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"why--it will get vapid and maybe worse. Well, I’d got it in my coat"
6778,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"pocket, and was walking back, just by Bow Church, no more thinking of"
6779,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"green silk pelisses than you are, Sir, at this moment--upon my honour"
6780,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"I wasn’t--when something gave a pop and a splash, and I heard a female"
6781,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"scream. I was afraid to look round and when I did, you might have"
6782,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"knocked me down with a straw. You know, Tom (addressing me,) I’m not"
6783,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"made of brass,--for the minute I felt more like melted lead--heavy and"
6784,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"hot. Two full kettles seemed poured over me--one warm within, and the"
6785,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"other cold without. You never saw such an object! There she stood,"
6786,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"winking and gasping, and all over froth and foam, like a lady just"
6787,POPPING THE QUESTION.,emerged out of the sea only they don’t bathe in green silk pelisses
6788,POPPING THE QUESTION.,and satin bonnets. You might have knocked me down with a hair. What I
6789,POPPING THE QUESTION.,did or said at first I don’t know; I only remember that I attempted to
6790,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"wipe her face with my handkerchief, but she preferred her own. To make"
6791,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"things worse, the passengers made a ring round us, as if we had been"
6792,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"going to fight about it, and a good many of ’em set up a laugh. I would"
6793,POPPING THE QUESTION.,rather have been surrounded by banditti. I don’t tell a lie if I say I
6794,POPPING THE QUESTION.,would gladly have been tossed out of the circle by a mad bull. How I

6796,POPPING THE QUESTION.,down a plug like an eel!”
6797,POPPING THE QUESTION.,
6798,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"“Very distressing, indeed,” said the drysalter."

6800,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"“I don’t think,” resumed W., “I felt as much when my poor mother"
6801,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"died--I don’t, upon my soul! _She_ was expected for years, but the"
6802,POPPING THE QUESTION.,lady in green came like a thunderbolt!--When I saw the ginger-beer
6803,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"weltering down her, I would almost as soon have seen blood. I felt"
6804,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"little short of a murderer. How I got her into Tweedie’s shop, Heaven"
6805,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"knows! I suppose I pulled her in, for I cannot remember one word of"
6806,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"persuasion. However, I got her into Tweedie’s, and had just sense"
6807,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"enough to seat her in a chair, and to beg for a few dry cloths. To do"
6808,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"the dear creature justice, she bore it all angelically,--but every"
6809,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"smile, every syllable making light of her calamity, went to my heart."

6814,POPPING THE QUESTION.,The drysalter signified dissent.

6816,POPPING THE QUESTION.,“No matter--his theory is right all over--it is as true as gospel!”
6817,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"exclaimed W., with an asseverating thump upon the table. “There _is_"
6818,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"an infernal, malicious, aggravating little demon, hovers up aloft"
6819,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"about us, wherever we go, ready to magnify any mischief, and deepen"
6820,POPPING THE QUESTION.,every disaster. Sure I am he hovered about me! The cloths came--but
6821,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"as soon as I began to wipe briskly, bang again went ‘t’other bottle,’"
6822,POPPING THE QUESTION.,and uncorked itself before it was called for. I shall never forget the
6823,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"sound! Pop, whiz, fiz, whish--ish--slish--slosh--slush--guggle, guggle,"
6824,POPPING THE QUESTION.,guggle: I’d rather have been at the exploding of the Dartford Powder
6825,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"Mills! At the first report I turned hastily round, but by so doing,"
6826,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"I only diverted the _jet_ from the open cases on the counter, to the"
6827,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"show-trays in the shop window, filled with Tweedie’s choicest cutlery;"
6828,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"and as I completed the pirouette, I favoured Tweedie himself with the"
6829,POPPING THE QUESTION.,tail of the spout!”
6830,POPPING THE QUESTION.,
6831,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"“Very unpleasant, indeed,” said the drysalter, with a hard wink, as if"
6832,POPPING THE QUESTION.,the fussy fluid had flown in his own face.
6833,POPPING THE QUESTION.,
6834,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"“Unpleasant!” ejaculated W., “it was unendurable! I could have cut my"

6838,POPPING THE QUESTION.,himself shake his head as he looked at the chains and some of the
6839,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"delicate articles. It wasn’t a time to stand upon words, and I believe"
6840,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"I cursed and swore like a trooper. I know I stamped about, for I went"
6841,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"on the lady’s foot, and that made me worse than ever. Tweedie says I"
6842,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"raved; and I do remember I cursed myself for talking of ginger-beer,"
6843,POPPING THE QUESTION.,as well as Hopkins for not keeping it in his house. At last I got
6844,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"so rampant, that even the lady began to console me, and as she had"
6845,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"a particularly sweet voice and manner, and Tweedie too, trying to"
6846,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"make things comfortable, I began to hear reason: but if ever I carry"
6847,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"ginger-beer again in my pocket, along Cheapside----”"

6853,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"means obtained her address, and as common politeness dictated, I"
6854,POPPING THE QUESTION.,afterwards called and was well received. A new green silk dress was
6855,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"graciously accepted, and a white one afterwards met with the same kind"
6856,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"indulgence, when the lady condescended to be Mrs. Walker. Our fortunes,"
6857,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"Sir, in this world, hinge frequently on trifles. Through an explosion"
6858,POPPING THE QUESTION.,of pop I thus popped into a partner with a pretty fortune; but for all
6859,POPPING THE QUESTION.,"that, I would not have any man, like the Persian in Hajji Baba, mistake"
6860,POPPING THE QUESTION.,a mere accident for the custom of the country. For Cœlebs in Search of

6915,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,Amongst the many important topics which at present excite a popular

6918,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"A subject presenting such very strong lights and shadows, necessarily"
6919,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,produces a powerful and Rembrandt-like effect on the public mind;
6920,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"nevertheless, it is only lately and accidentally, that I have been"
6921,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,induced to look critically into the colouring and handling of the
6922,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,picture. It is not my wont to walk wilfully on Debatable Ground; but in

6927,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"A few days ago, I was giving an order to a tradesman in the"
6928,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"Strand--_not far from Warren’s_--when, to the utter surprise and"
6929,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"disconcertment of the master of the shop, a poor African stepped in"
6930,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"from the street, and, with an obsequious bow, made an offer of his"
6931,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,sable services for a term of years.

6934,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,
6935,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,It would require a far better artist than myself to do justice to the
6936,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"scene which ensued on so unusual an application. The late Elia, in his"
6937,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"Essay on “Imperfect Sympathies,” has alluded to the natural repugnance"
6938,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"of the pale faces to the dark ones. “In the negro countenance,” he"
6939,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"says, “you will often meet with strong traits of benignity. I have"
6940,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"felt yearnings of tenderness towards some of these faces, or rather"
6941,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"masks, that have looked out kindly upon one in casual encounters in"
6942,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,the streets and highways. I love what Fuller beautifully calls ‘these
6943,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,images of God cut in ebony.’ But I should not like to associate with
6944,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,them--to share my meals and my good-nights with them--because they are
6945,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"black.” Such a feeling is truly an imperfect sympathy, but my Strand"
6946,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"shopkeeper evidently went beyond the essayist, and regarded “the"
6947,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"nigger” with a positive antipathy. “A good horse,” says the proverb,"
6948,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"“cannot be of a bad colour,” but I could not help feeling that a good"
6949,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"man might be of an unfortunate complexion, howbeit, of a hue which"
6950,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"wears well, washes well, does not fly, and, moreover, hides the dirt."
6951,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"So far from being able to endure a moor as his companion, the master"
6952,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,tradesman could not look upon him as fit to be his subordinate. The
6953,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"mere possibility of such a connexion had never occurred to him, or"
6954,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"assuredly, to the advertisement in the window for an apprentice, he"
6955,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"would have added “a White will be preferred,” or “No African need"
6956,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"apply.” In the meantime, it was sufficiently obvious that, even if"
6957,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"indentured, a Hottentot would never be “treated as one of the family.”"
6958,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"Whilst the master stared an unequivocal rejection, his wife looked"
6959,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"over his shoulder at the applicant, with all the _physical_ expression"
6960,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"in her countenance, of the anticipation of a black dose; the little"
6961,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,boy took fright and tried to bolt; the baby even set its infantine
6962,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"face against the adoption, and the very dog barked and growled at the"
6963,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,intruder as at a breed that was vermin. The result of such a scrutiny
6964,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,needs hardly to be told; the poor candidate was unanimously blackballed
6965,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"to his face, and recommended, unceremoniously, to make himself as"
6966,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,scarce as a swan of the same complexion.
6967,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,
6968,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"It will do me no credit, I fear, with our active Abolitionists, to"
6969,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"confess, that the above little incident set me seriously thinking, for"
6970,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"the first time, on the condition of the Negro Apprentices. In addition"
6971,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,to my dread of becoming a _sidesman_--and there is a spirit abroad
6972,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,which can convert even a black suit into a party-coloured one--I
6973,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"am too apt to take matters upon trust, and to suppose that the name"
6974,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"stands for the thing. Thus, in my simple belief, the outward-bound and"
6975,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"the homeward-bound apprentices, conformed to the same or nearly the"
6976,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"same articles; and if I thought at all of the sable ones, it was as"
6977,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"walking abroad on Sundays, drest in all their best, only with Phœbe"
6978,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"or Miss Diana, instead of “Sally in our Alley.” A common sense of"
6979,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"the eternal principles of justice helped, beside, to mislead me; for"
6980,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"who, with a drachm of philosophy, or a scruple of Christianity, could"
6981,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"suppose, that whilst the accidents of colour are overlooked in a good"
6982,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"horse, the moral qualities of a human being were weighed down by such"
6983,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,skin-deep casualties as occur every day in a baker’s oven? The scene
6984,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"in the Strand, however, aroused certain misgivings; and for the mere"
6985,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"repose of my mind, it became necessary to procure further information,"
6986,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"in order to come to a settled opinion on the subject. To this end, it"
6987,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"was desirable to obtain the sentiments of a Black Apprentice, or at"
6988,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"least of a Black, and of an Apprentice, and fortune favoured me in the"
6989,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"search. Having delivered my instructions to the tradesman, it occurred"
6990,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,to me to pay an overdue visit to a decayed kinswoman in the same
6991,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"neighbourhood, and in whose family affairs I took a friendly interest."
6992,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,She happened to be at home; and after a preliminary conversation on the
6993,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"weather, and Mr. Murphy, and the current news of the day, the discourse"
6994,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"turned on her son Richard, whom she had recently articled to an"
6995,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"architect; she had doubts, she said, of his being exactly comfortable"
6996,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"in his situation, but it was no fault of hers, as he had been placed in"
6997,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,"it at his own urgent instances, in proof whereof she handed to me the"
6998,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,following letter:--
6999,THE BLACK AND WHITE QUESTION.,
7000,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","MY DEAR MOTHER,"
7001,"MY DEAR MOTHER,",
7002,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","This is to say I am in good health and quite comfortable, and as"
7003,"MY DEAR MOTHER,",happy as can be expected away from home. I like being an architect
7004,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","very much. All the work I have had to do for the last fortnight,"
7005,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","has been to copy a drawing of a gate for a Porter’s Lodge, and to"
7006,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","look over portfolios of nice prints. My master is very kind, and"
7007,"MY DEAR MOTHER,",lets me fill up my time at over-hours how I like. I always dine
7008,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","with him and Mrs. G., and have plenty to eat of whatever I prefer."
7009,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","Last Sunday we had leg of lamb and asparagus, and a pigeon pie,"
7010,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","and a tart, besides a glass of wine afterwards. I’m allowed to sit"
7011,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","up to supper because I said I liked music, for Mr. G. plays on the"
7012,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","flute, and Mrs. G. sings to the piano. He is a very good man, and"
7013,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","she is a very motherly good woman; and the other night, because it"
7014,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","was so cold, I had a tumbler of hot elder wine. For the present I"
7015,"MY DEAR MOTHER,",sleep in the best spare bed till my own is got ready for me--and
7016,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","when company comes I’m not sent off to it, but played last night"
7017,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","with the visitors till twelve o’clock, and they won all my pocket"
7018,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","money. I do hope and pray you won’t forget to send me some more, as"
7019,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","there’s another party next week. Altogether, I could not be better"
7020,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","off for food, or amusement, or any thing, so that I needn’t be any"
7021,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","longer on liking, as I like it very much, and am agreeable to be"
7022,"MY DEAR MOTHER,",bound as soon as you and master think proper; and I do hope you
7023,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","won’t stick about the premium, as you seemed to think it a great"
7024,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","deal--but consider the treatment. Give my kind love to everybody,"
7025,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","and accept the same yourself, from, dear mother, your dutiful and"
7026,"MY DEAR MOTHER,","affectionate son,"

7035,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"It may be supposed that I did not read the above effusion throughout,"
7036,RICHARD RUGGLES.,without a smile on my countenance; but the mother gravely shook her
7037,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"head, and said she had now to submit to me a very different statement,"
7038,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"whereupon with a sigh, and a reflection on the duplicity of the world"

7044,"DEAR MOTHER,","I am very sorry to trouble your mind with anything unpleasant,"

7046,"DEAR MOTHER,",and the premium paid down. All the being on liking has come to
7047,"DEAR MOTHER,","a sudden end. Mr. and Mrs. G. have thrown off their masks, and"
7048,"DEAR MOTHER,","he is a cruel tyrant; and instead of being another mother to me,"
7049,"DEAR MOTHER,",she is quite the reverse. I little thought the moment I became an
7050,"DEAR MOTHER,","apprentice I should be a complete slave, and work like a horse."
7051,"DEAR MOTHER,","Nothing but drawing, drawing, drawing, as long as it’s light--and"
7052,"DEAR MOTHER,","next week we begin lamps. I’ve no over-hours at all except in bed,"
7053,"DEAR MOTHER,","and that’s up in the back garret, and nothing but an old flock as"
7054,"DEAR MOTHER,",hard as wood. My being a parlour boarder is all over; and as to
7055,"DEAR MOTHER,","sitting up to music and supper, I can’t repeat, but I’m d--d up at"
7056,"DEAR MOTHER,",night that I may be down in the morning. They have not sent me as
7057,"DEAR MOTHER,","yet to take my meals in the kitchen, but I would almost as soon,"
7058,"DEAR MOTHER,",for I’m snubb’d if I open my lips at table; and the moment the
7059,"DEAR MOTHER,","wine comes on I’m expected to be off, and am reminded if I don’t."
7060,"DEAR MOTHER,","As for the visitors, they take no more notice of me than they do"
7061,"DEAR MOTHER,","of the foot-boy; but what goes most to my heart is, Mr. and Mrs."
7062,"DEAR MOTHER,",G. never ask now after your delicate health. It’s very ungrateful
7063,"DEAR MOTHER,","after paying so handsomely, but it’s my belief he doesn’t know"
7064,"DEAR MOTHER,","anything about architecture, and only takes in young gentlemen for"
7065,"DEAR MOTHER,","the sake of their premiums. I can t help feeling very unhappy, when"
7066,"DEAR MOTHER,","I think I’ve got to run seven years to come, and do wish you would"
7067,"DEAR MOTHER,","ask Uncle William, as he’s a lawyer, whether I can’t be turned"
7068,"DEAR MOTHER,","over by legal law, or cancelled and left to my liberty. Next to"
7069,"DEAR MOTHER,","an architect, I should like, if was unbound, to be an author,"
7070,"DEAR MOTHER,","and write books; which I hope you will approve of, as it doesn’t"
7071,"DEAR MOTHER,","require any premium. But perhaps you would like to have me at home,"
7072,"DEAR MOTHER,","and to be nothing at all, with which I remain,"
7073,"DEAR MOTHER,",
7074,"DEAR MOTHER,","My dear mother, your dutiful and affectionate son,"
7075,RICHARD RUGGLES.,RICHARD RUGGLES.
7076,RICHARD RUGGLES.,
7077,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"As the above letters are genuine, it is probable that many of my"
7078,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"readers, who are parents or guardians, have received similar epistles"
7079,RICHARD RUGGLES.,from their sons or wards before or after their being articled to a
7080,RICHARD RUGGLES.,trade or a profession; at least there is reason to believe that the
7081,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"above case is one of ordinary occurrence. Taking it, therefore, as a"
7082,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"fair sample of the practice in England, I was anxious to compare it"
7083,RICHARD RUGGLES.,with the course of a negro apprenticeship in the colonies; and with
7084,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"this view my next visit was paid to my old friend Colonel C., who had"
7085,RICHARD RUGGLES.,recently arrived from Jamaica with a black “turn-over” in his service.
7086,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"Having described the scene at the shop in the Strand, and explained my"
7087,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"errand, which, of course, subjected me to some raillery, my request was"
7088,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"acceded to, and Sambo was ordered to attend me to a private conference"
7089,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"in the study. He was a stout good-humoured African, with rather more"
7090,RICHARD RUGGLES.,than the twilight intelligence allowed to the race by the late Monk
7091,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"Lewis; but with all the characteristic relish for a talk with Massa,"
7092,RICHARD RUGGLES.,ascribed to his brethren by the same pleasant authority. He entered
7093,RICHARD RUGGLES.,therefore into the discussion with the greatest good-will; and the
7094,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"following, divested of his outlandish jargon, is the substance of his"
7095,RICHARD RUGGLES.,evidence.
7096,RICHARD RUGGLES.,
7097,RICHARD RUGGLES.,[Illustration: APPRENTICE ON LIKING.]
7098,RICHARD RUGGLES.,
7099,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"To my first question, whether he had ever betrayed any original"
7100,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"inclination to go into the rice, sugar, and tobacco line, he gave"
7101,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"a decided negative. He had no occasion, he said, to labour for a"
7102,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"livelihood, having been in his own country an independent black"
7103,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"prince, and heir-apparent, as I understood him, to the king of the"
7104,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"Eboes. He acknowledged, however, that he could neither read nor"
7105,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"write, and consequently had never applied personally, or by letter,"
7106,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"post paid, to any Transatlantic A. B. C. or X. Y. Z., in answer to"
7107,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"an advertisement for an “Articled Pupil.” He was taken, he affirmed,"
7108,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"at unawares, and he was positive that no premium was required with"
7109,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"him. It appeared, however, that he had been regularly bound, but on"
7110,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"explanation it turned out that it had been done with rope-yarn, and the"
7111,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"only indentures he knew of, were on his wrists and ankles, from the"
7112,RICHARD RUGGLES.,pressure of his fetters. He had a decided impression that his parents
7113,RICHARD RUGGLES.,or guardians were never applied to for their concurrence; indeed he had
7114,RICHARD RUGGLES.,no recollection of being asked for his own assent to the arrangement.
7115,RICHARD RUGGLES.,He would “take his dam” he was never carried before the Chamberlain
7116,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"or any official personage invested with similar functions, and denied"
7117,RICHARD RUGGLES.,ever having received the slightest hint that the binding him was
7118,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"necessary to entitle him to take up his freedom. In short, contrary"
7119,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"to the experience of Richard Ruggles, his very first step appeared to"
7120,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"have been into slavery, and it was only after a long term of severe"
7121,RICHARD RUGGLES.,service in the rice-field and the cane-piece that he was constituted
7122,RICHARD RUGGLES.,an apprentice. This being the point to which the public interest is
7123,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"mainly directed, my enquiries here became naturally more minute, and"
7124,RICHARD RUGGLES.,the evidence was proportionably circumstantial. Taking the Ruggles
7125,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"letters for my guide, I was at great pains to make out something"
7126,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"analogous to the state of being what is called “upon liking,” but I"
7127,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"failed to elicit anything of the sort; and from the solemnity, not to"
7128,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"say awfulness, of Sambo’s asseverations, there appeared no reason to"
7129,RICHARD RUGGLES.,suspect his veracity. He denied most positively and repeatedly his
7130,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"dining, in any one solitary instance, with his master and mistress,"
7131,RICHARD RUGGLES.,and by consequence the pleasure of taking wine with them after the
7132,RICHARD RUGGLES.,social repast. He was equally firm in disclaiming any invitation to
7133,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"sit up to supper; and instead of being asked if he liked music, he"
7134,RICHARD RUGGLES.,declared indignantly that his favourite instruments the kitty-katty and
7135,RICHARD RUGGLES.,the ganby had been continually broken over his own head. He totally
7136,RICHARD RUGGLES.,repudiated the notion of playing at Pope Joan with the company that
7137,RICHARD RUGGLES.,came to his master’s house; and insisted that the only notice he ever
7138,RICHARD RUGGLES.,obtained from the visitors was his being “larrupped” by every gentleman
7139,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"that got drunk, and none of them ever went away sober. On the whole he"
7140,RICHARD RUGGLES.,would not allow himself to have received any personal benefit from his
7141,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"metamorphosis by Act of Parliament into an apprentice; no, not even"
7142,RICHARD RUGGLES.,to the extent of sparing him one single cut of the cowhide. He rather
7143,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"thought, on the contrary, that the prospect of his being out of his"
7144,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"time in so many years had operated to the prejudice of the negro, by"
7145,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"tempting the owner in the interim to get as much out of him, and pitch"
7146,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"as much into him, as possible. To conclude, I charged Sambo very home"
7147,RICHARD RUGGLES.,with a question which has been much dwelt upon by certain members of
7148,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"both Houses; namely, whether the blacks were “properly prepared” to"
7149,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"enter into a state of liberty? to which he answered very candidly,"
7150,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"that he had not formally examined them on the subject, but judging by"
7151,RICHARD RUGGLES.,himself he should say they were quite as fit and prepared for freedom
7152,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"as they had been for slavery, to which they had mostly been introduced"
7153,RICHARD RUGGLES.,at an unfashionably short notice. For his own part he had been rather
7154,RICHARD RUGGLES.,suddenly emancipated by simply stepping on English ground; but the only
7155,RICHARD RUGGLES.,effect had been to inspire him with profound feelings of veneration and
7156,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"gratitude towards the soil, and a most fervent wish that he could send"
7157,RICHARD RUGGLES.,over a barrowful of the same earth for Black Juno and de pickaninnies
7158,RICHARD RUGGLES.,to put him foot upon in Jamakey.
7159,RICHARD RUGGLES.,
7160,RICHARD RUGGLES.,Such was the result of my conference with Sambo; and it served to
7161,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"account for the conduct of the tradesman in the Strand, by proving,"
7162,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"that instead of being treated as one of the family, in a limited sense,"
7163,RICHARD RUGGLES.,the Negro is hardly looked upon as a member of that great domestic
7164,RICHARD RUGGLES.,circle which has a circumference of 360 degrees. It appears from the
7165,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"facts, that an apprenticeship in Jamaica or Barbadoes has little or"
7166,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"nothing in common except the name, with an apprenticeship on our own"
7167,RICHARD RUGGLES.,side of the Atlantic;--that under the same title there exists two
7168,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"diametrically opposite systems, literally as different as light and"
7169,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"dark; and of course, as the hand said of the pair of gloves, “They"
7170,RICHARD RUGGLES.,cannot _both_ be right.” As the collective wisdom of the country has
7171,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"decided that the Black style of _binding_ is the correct pattern,"
7172,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"and that the Negroes are properly “done up,” it necessarily follows,"
7173,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"that our home-made articles are very loosely stitched, and without"
7174,RICHARD RUGGLES.,a due provision for rough usage and durability. Assuming the sable
7175,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"race to be subject to only a wholesome severity, it results that our"
7176,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"London Prentices and their kind, are held by indentures shamefully"
7177,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"lax in their conditions, and are allowed a most culpable latitude"
7178,RICHARD RUGGLES.,and indulgence. To place this gross partiality in the strongest light
7179,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"and shade, let the servitude of the born Blacks be compared with that"
7180,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"of those “Africans of our own growth,” as Elia calls them, who derive"
7181,RICHARD RUGGLES.,their nigritude not from nature but from soot. Simply because they
7182,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"have once been whites, and are still white, or nearly white, once a"
7183,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"year, like the hawthorns in May, they are protected and even pampered"
7184,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"by laws, the framers of which have assuredly considered their own"
7185,RICHARD RUGGLES.,crows as the fairest. Let any one turn to the Statute Anno Quarto et
7186,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"Quinto Gulielmi IV. Regis, cap. 35, intituled “An Act for the Better"
7187,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"Regulation of Chimney Sweepers and their Apprentices,” and he will find"
7188,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"that the Climbing Boy, compared with the African, is almost a spoiled"
7189,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"child. Instead of allowing him to be nabbed or grabbed, anyhow and"
7190,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"willynilly, like our friend Sambo, the statute insists, by article 9,"
7191,RICHARD RUGGLES.,that the binding shall not take place without the concurrence of “a
7192,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"parish officer, or the parent, or next friend.” Article 10 provides,"
7193,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"that instead of rope-yarn, as in the case of Sambo aforesaid, the"
7194,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"binding shall only be effected with “paper or parchment,” and even"
7195,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"before enduring such very mild ligatures, article 13 declares, that"
7196,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"the boy is to be regularly “asked out,” before two Justices of the"
7197,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"Peace, and in case such boy shall be unwilling to be bound with “paper"
7198,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"and parchment,” “such Justices shall, and they are hereby required to"
7199,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"refuse, to sanction or approve of such binding.” The 12th clause allows"
7200,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"the practice of “liking,” or what, in electioneering cases, would be"
7201,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"called “treating;” and before any boy shall be bound as an apprentice,"
7202,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"“it shall be lawful for the intended master of such boy to have, and"
7203,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"receive such boy in such master’s house, on trial--or ‘liking’--for"
7204,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"any time not exceeding two calendar months.” In plain English, it"
7205,RICHARD RUGGLES.,shall be lawful for the said master elect to tempt and bribe the said
7206,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"apprentice, like Richard Ruggles, during eight weeks, by dinners"
7207,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"of “delicate cow-heel, with the sauce His Grace is so fond of,” and"
7208,RICHARD RUGGLES.,suppers of hot sausages. And that the cow-heel and sausages may not be
7209,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"too minutely subdivided, clause 14 enacts, that Mr. or Mrs. Chimney"
7210,RICHARD RUGGLES.,Sweeper shall not have more than two apprentices on trial or “liking”
7211,RICHARD RUGGLES.,at the same time. The same considerate clause forbids Mr. or Mrs. C.
7212,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"S. to have more than four apprentices at once, so that nothing like"
7213,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"the close packing, which so often incommodes the race of Africa in a"
7214,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"ship’s hold, may inconvenience the favoured sooterkins in the cellar. A"
7215,RICHARD RUGGLES.,taste for music is not specially mentioned or protected: but as clause
7216,RICHARD RUGGLES.,17 empowers any two or more magistrates to hear “all complaints” of
7217,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"hard or ill usage, the breaking of a fife or his pan’s pipes, over the"
7218,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"head of an apprentice, would be certain to be listened to, and in all"
7219,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"probability entail on the master a forfeit, fixed, by clause 16, at"
7220,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"“not exceeding 10_l._ nor less than 40_s._” The 18th clause enjoins,"
7221,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"on all builders and bricklayers, under extremely heavy penalties, to"
7222,RICHARD RUGGLES.,construct safe and comfortable chimneys that shall not be “hard to
7223,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"climb;” and finally, as if a sweeper on such very eligible terms could"
7224,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"have anything to weep for, article 15 forbids, somewhat superfluously,"
7225,RICHARD RUGGLES.,his crying about the streets!!! The incredulous reader who may wish
7226,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"to verify this statement by reference to the Act itself, will find it"
7227,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"at full length, and shown “all up” in a well-conceived little volume,"
7228,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"called “The Mechanics of Law Making,” by a Member of Symond’s Inn."
7229,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"He will there find too truly that, compared with the genuine black,"
7230,RICHARD RUGGLES.,the sweeper is treated by law with as much tenderness as if each
7231,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"climbing-boy were, like the stolen Montague, a well-born white young"
7232,RICHARD RUGGLES.,gentleman in disguise. The tendency of such over-indulgent enactments
7233,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"to spoil the youth of this country is evidenced in the fact, that"
7234,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"whilst the planter will give a considerable sum for a black assistant,"
7235,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"a white articled pupil is hardly acceptable as a present, and in most"
7236,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"cases, like Richard Ruggles, must have a handsome premium given"
7237,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"along with him to purchase him a master. As a mere matter of economy,"
7238,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"therefore, the matter is worth the consideration of parents and"
7239,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"guardians, and parish officers; whilst the advocates of equal justice"
7240,RICHARD RUGGLES.,to all will imperatively insist that if the blacks cannot be treated
7241,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"like whites, the whites ought to be treated as blacks. For my own part,"
7242,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"as a simple admirer of consistency, I cannot help thinking that the"
7243,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"whole system of apprenticeship, as regards its home practice, requires"
7244,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"to undergo a rigorous revision, and above all, that the act Anno Quarto"
7245,RICHARD RUGGLES.,"et Quinto Gulielmi IV. Regis, cap. 35, with all its sweeping clauses,"
7246,RICHARD RUGGLES.,ought to be immediately repealed.

7431,THE PILLORY.,"I never was in the pillory but once, which I must ever consider a"

7433,THE PILLORY.,"and enquiring eye, and courting experience for the sake of my"
7434,THE PILLORY.,"fellow-creatures, I cannot but lament the short and imperfect"
7435,THE PILLORY.,"opportunity I enjoyed of filling that elevated situation, which so few"
7436,THE PILLORY.,men are destined to occupy. It is a sort of Egg-Premiership; a place
7437,THE PILLORY.,"above your fellows, but a place in which your hands are tied. You are"
7438,THE PILLORY.,"not without the established political vice, for you are not absolved"
7439,THE PILLORY.,from turning.
7440,THE PILLORY.,
7441,THE PILLORY.,Let me give a brief description of the short irregular glimpse I had of
7442,THE PILLORY.,"men and things, while I was in Pillory Power. I was raised to it, as"
7443,THE PILLORY.,"many men are to high stations, by my errors. I merely made a mistake"
7444,THE PILLORY.,"of some sort or other in an answer in Chancery, not injurious to my"
7445,THE PILLORY.,"interests, and lo! the Recorder of London, with a suavity of manner"
7446,THE PILLORY.,"peculiar to himself, announced to me my intended promotion, and in due"
7447,THE PILLORY.,time I was installed into office!
7448,THE PILLORY.,
7449,THE PILLORY.,"It was a fine day for the pillory; that is to say, it rained in"
7450,THE PILLORY.,"torrents. Those only who have had boarding and lodging like mine, can"
7451,THE PILLORY.,estimate the comfort of having washing into the bargain.
7452,THE PILLORY.,
7453,THE PILLORY.,"It was about noon, when I was placed, like a statue, upon my wooden"
7454,THE PILLORY.,pedestal; an hour probably chosen out of consideration to the innocent
7455,THE PILLORY.,"little urchins then let out of school, for they are a race notoriously"
7456,THE PILLORY.,"fond of shying, pitching, jerking, pelting, flinging, slinging--in"
7457,THE PILLORY.,"short, professors of throwing in all its branches. The public officer"
7458,THE PILLORY.,"presented me first with a north front, and there I was--“God save"
7459,THE PILLORY.,"the mark!”--like a cock at Shrovetide, or a lay-figure in a Shooting"
7460,THE PILLORY.,Gallery!
7461,THE PILLORY.,
7462,THE PILLORY.,The storm commenced. Stones began to spit--mud to
7463,THE PILLORY.,mizzle--cabbage-stalks thickened into a shower. Now and then came a
7464,THE PILLORY.,dead kitten--sometimes a living cur: anon an egg would hit me on the
7465,THE PILLORY.,"eye, an offence I was obliged to wink at. There is a strange appetite"
7466,THE PILLORY.,in human kind for pelting a fellow-creature. A travelling China-man
7467,THE PILLORY.,actually threw away twopence to have a pitch at me with a pipkin; a
7468,THE PILLORY.,"Billinsgate huckster treated me with a few herrings, not by any means"
7469,THE PILLORY.,too stale to be purchased in St. Giles’s; while the weekly halfpence
7470,THE PILLORY.,of the schoolboys went towards the support of a Costermonger and his
7471,THE PILLORY.,"Donkey, who supplied them with eggs fit for throwing, and for nothing"
7472,THE PILLORY.,"else. I confess this last description of missiles, if missiles they"
7473,THE PILLORY.,"might be called that never miss’d, annoyed me more than all the rest;"
7474,THE PILLORY.,"however, there was no remedy. There I was forced to stand, taking up"
7475,THE PILLORY.,"my livery, and a vile livery it was; or, as a wag expressed it, “being"
7476,THE PILLORY.,made free of the Peltmongers.”
7477,THE PILLORY.,
7478,THE PILLORY.,[Illustration: WHAT MUST BE--MUST.]
7479,THE PILLORY.,
7480,THE PILLORY.,It was time to appeal to my resources. I had read somewhere of an
7481,THE PILLORY.,"Italian, who, by dint of mental abstraction, had rendered himself"
7482,THE PILLORY.,"unconscious of the rack, and while the executioners were tugging,"
7483,THE PILLORY.,"wrenching, twisting, dislocating, and breaking joints, sinews, and"
7484,THE PILLORY.,"bones, was perchance in fancy only performing his diurnal Gymnastics,"
7485,THE PILLORY.,or undergoing an amicable Shampooing. The pillory was a milder
7486,THE PILLORY.,"instrument than the rack, and I had naturally a lively imagination; it"
7487,THE PILLORY.,"seemed plausible, therefore, that I might make shift to be pelted in my"
7488,THE PILLORY.,"absence. To attain a scene as remote as possible from pain, I selected"
7489,THE PILLORY.,"one of absolute pleasure for the experiment; no other, in truth, than"
7490,THE PILLORY.,"that Persian Paradise, the Garden of Gul, at the Feast of Roses."
7491,THE PILLORY.,"Flapping the wings of Fancy with all my might, I was speedily in those"
7492,THE PILLORY.,"Bowers of Bliss, and at high romps with Houri and Peri,--"
7493,THE PILLORY.,
7494,THE PILLORY.,“Flinging roses at each other.”
7495,THE PILLORY.,
7496,THE PILLORY.,"But, alas, for mental abstraction! The very first bud hit me with"
7497,THE PILLORY.,"stone-like vehemence; my next rose, of the cabbage kind, breathed only"
7498,THE PILLORY.,a rank cabbage fragrance; and in another moment the claws of a flying
7499,THE PILLORY.,"cat scratched me back into myself; and there I was again, in full pelt"
7500,THE PILLORY.,in the pillory!
7501,THE PILLORY.,
7502,THE PILLORY.,"My first fifteen minutes, the only quarter I met with, had now elapsed,"
7503,THE PILLORY.,and my face was turned towards the East. The first object my one eye
7504,THE PILLORY.,"fell upon was a heap of Macadamisation, and I confess I never thought"
7505,THE PILLORY.,"of calculating the number of stones in such a hillock, till I saw the"
7506,THE PILLORY.,mob preparing to cast them up!
7507,THE PILLORY.,
7508,THE PILLORY.,I expected to be lithographed on the spot! Instinct suggested to me
7509,THE PILLORY.,that the only way to save my life was by dying; so dropping my head and
7510,THE PILLORY.,"hands, and closing my last eye with a terrific groan, I expired for"
7511,THE PILLORY.,"the present. The _ruse_ took effect. Supposing me to be defunct, the"
7512,THE PILLORY.,mob refused to kill me. Shouts of “Murder! Shame! Shame! No Pillory!”
7513,THE PILLORY.,"burst from all quarters. The Pipkin-monger abused the Fishwoman, who"
7514,THE PILLORY.,"rated the Schoolboys; they in turn fell foul of the Costermonger,"
7515,THE PILLORY.,"who was hissing and groaning at the whole assembly; and, finally,"
7516,THE PILLORY.,a philanthropic Constable took the whole group into custody. In the
7517,THE PILLORY.,"mean time I was taken down, laid with a sack over me in a cart, and"
7518,THE PILLORY.,"driven off to a Hospital, my body seeming a very proper present to"
7519,THE PILLORY.,"St. Bartholomew’s or St. Thomas’s, but my clothes fit for nothing but"

7647,THE YEOMANRY.,"Amongst the agitations of the day, there is none more unaccountable"
7648,THE YEOMANRY.,"to a peaceable man in a time of peace, than the resistance to the"
7649,THE YEOMANRY.,disbanding of the Yeomanry. It is of course impossible for anyone so
7650,THE YEOMANRY.,"unconnected with party as myself, to divine the ministerial motives for"
7651,THE YEOMANRY.,"the measure; but judging from my own experience, I should have expected"
7652,THE YEOMANRY.,"that every private at least, would have mounted his best hunter to make"
7653,THE YEOMANRY.,"a jump at the offer. It appears, however, that a part of the military"
7654,THE YEOMANRY.,body in question betrays a strong disinclination to dismiss; and
7655,THE YEOMANRY.,"certain troops have even offered their services gratuitously, and been"
7656,THE YEOMANRY.,"accepted, although it is evident that such a troop, to be consistent,"
7657,THE YEOMANRY.,"ought to refuse, when called upon to act, to make any charge whatever."
7658,THE YEOMANRY.,
7659,THE YEOMANRY.,[Illustration: “I VISH VE COULD BE DISBANDY’D.”]
7660,THE YEOMANRY.,
7661,THE YEOMANRY.,"Amongst my Scottish reminiscences, I have a vivid recollection of once"
7662,THE YEOMANRY.,"encountering, on the road from Dundee to Perth, a party of soldiers,"
7663,THE YEOMANRY.,"having in their custody a poor fellow in the garb of a peasant, and"
7664,THE YEOMANRY.,"secured by handcuffs. He looked somewhat melancholy, as he well might,"
7665,THE YEOMANRY.,under the uncertainty whether he was to be flogged within an inch
7666,THE YEOMANRY.,"of his life, or shot to death, for such were the punishments of his"
7667,THE YEOMANRY.,"offence, which I understood to be desertion, or disbanding himself"
7668,THE YEOMANRY.,"without leave. It was natural to conclude, that no ordinary disgust"
7669,THE YEOMANRY.,at a military life would induce a man to incur such heavy penalties.
7670,THE YEOMANRY.,With what gratitude would _he_ have accepted his discharge! He would
7671,THE YEOMANRY.,surely have embraced the offer of being let off with the alacrity of
7672,THE YEOMANRY.,"gunpowder! And yet he was a regular, in the receipt of pay, and with"
7673,THE YEOMANRY.,"the prospect and opportunity, so rare to our yeomanry, of winning"
7674,THE YEOMANRY.,"laurels, and covering himself with glory!"
7675,THE YEOMANRY.,
7676,THE YEOMANRY.,"It has been argued, on high authority, as a reason for retaining the"
7677,THE YEOMANRY.,"troops in question, that they are the most _constitutional_ force that"
7678,THE YEOMANRY.,could be selected; and truly of their general robustness there can be
7679,THE YEOMANRY.,"but one opinion. However, if a domestic force of the kind ought to be"
7680,THE YEOMANRY.,"kept up, would it not be advisable, and humane, and fair, to give the"
7681,THE YEOMANRY.,"manufacturing body a turn, and form troops of the sedentary weavers and"
7682,THE YEOMANRY.,"other artisans, who stand so much more in need of out-of-door exercise?"
7683,THE YEOMANRY.,"The farmer, from the nature of his business, has _Field_ Days enough,"
7684,THE YEOMANRY.,to say nothing of the charges and throwings off he enjoys in hunting
7685,THE YEOMANRY.,"and coursing, besides riding periodically to and from market, or the"
7686,THE YEOMANRY.,"neighbouring fairs. Indeed, the true English yeoman is generally,"
7687,THE YEOMANRY.,"thanks to these sports and employments, so constantly in the saddle,"
7688,THE YEOMANRY.,"that instead of volunteering into any cavalry, it might be supposed he"
7689,THE YEOMANRY.,"would be glad to feel his own legs a little, and enjoy the household"
7690,THE YEOMANRY.,comforts of the chimney-corner and the elbow-chair. As regards their
7691,THE YEOMANRY.,"effectiveness, I have had the pleasure of seeing a troop fire at a"
7692,THE YEOMANRY.,"target for a subscription silver cup; and it convinced me, that if I"
7693,THE YEOMANRY.,"had felt inclined to _roast_ them, their own _fire_ was the very best"
7694,THE YEOMANRY.,one for my purpose. On another occasion I had the gratification of
7695,THE YEOMANRY.,"beholding a charge, and as they succeeded in dispersing themselves, it"
7696,THE YEOMANRY.,may be inferred that they might possibly do as much by a mob. Still
7697,THE YEOMANRY.,"there seemed hardly excitement enough or amusement enough, except"
7698,THE YEOMANRY.,"to the spectators, in such playing at soldiers, to induce honest,"
7699,THE YEOMANRY.,"hearty, fox-hunting farmers, to wish to become veterans. To tell the"
7700,THE YEOMANRY.,"truth, I have heard before now, repentant grumblings from practical"
7701,THE YEOMANRY.,"agriculturists, who had too rashly adopted the uniform, and have seen"
7702,THE YEOMANRY.,even their horses betray an inclination to back out of the line. The
7703,THE YEOMANRY.,"more therefore is my surprise, on all accounts, to hear that the"
7704,THE YEOMANRY.,"Yeomanry are so unwilling to be dispensed with, and relieved from"
7705,THE YEOMANRY.,inactive service; for though the song tells us of a “Soldier tir’d of
7706,THE YEOMANRY.,"war’s alarms,” there is no doubt that to a soldier of spirit, the most"
7707,THE YEOMANRY.,tiresome thing in the world is to have no alarms at all.
7708,THE YEOMANRY.,
7709,THE YEOMANRY.,In the mean time I have been at some pains to ascertain the sentiments
7710,THE YEOMANRY.,"of the yeowomanry on the subject, and if they all feel in common"
7711,THE YEOMANRY.,"with Dame, the disbanding will be a most popular measure amongst the"
7712,THE YEOMANRY.,"farmers’ wives. I had no sooner communicated the news, through the"
7713,THE YEOMANRY.,"old lady’s trumpet, than she exclaimed, that “it was the best hearing"
7714,THE YEOMANRY.,she had had for many a long day! The Sogering work unsettled both
7715,THE YEOMANRY.,"men and horses--it took her husband’s head off his business, and it"
7716,THE YEOMANRY.,"threw herself off the old mare, at the last fair, along of a showman’s"
7717,THE YEOMANRY.,"trumpet. Besides, it set all the farm servants a-sogering too, and"
7718,THE YEOMANRY.,"when they went to the Wake, only old Roger came back again to say they"
7719,THE YEOMANRY.,"had all ’listed. They had more sense, however, than their master, for"
7720,THE YEOMANRY.,"they all wanted to be disbanded the next morning. As for the master,"
7721,THE YEOMANRY.,he’d never been the same man since he put on the uniform; but had
7722,THE YEOMANRY.,"got a hectoring swaggering way with him, as if everybody that didn’t"
7723,THE YEOMANRY.,"agree in politics, and especially about the Corn Bill, was to be bored"
7724,THE YEOMANRY.,and slashed with sword and pistol. Then there was the constant dread
7725,THE YEOMANRY.,"that in his practising, cut six would either come home to him, or"
7726,THE YEOMANRY.,do a mischief to his neighbours; and after a reviewing there was no
7727,THE YEOMANRY.,"bearing him, it put him so up in his stirrups, and on coming home he’d"
7728,THE YEOMANRY.,think nothing of slivering off all the hollyoaks as he brandished and
7729,THE YEOMANRY.,"flourished up the front garden. Another thing, and that was no trifle,"
7730,THE YEOMANRY.,"was the accidents; she couldn’t tell how it was, whether he thought too"
7731,THE YEOMANRY.,"much of himself and too little of his horse, but he always got a tumble"
7732,THE YEOMANRY.,"with the yeomanry, though he’d fox-hunt by the year together without"
7733,THE YEOMANRY.,"a fall. What was worse, a fall always made him crusty, and when he"
7734,THE YEOMANRY.,"was crusty, he made a point to get into his cups, which made him more"
7735,THE YEOMANRY.,"crusty still. Thank God, as yet he had never been of any use to his"
7736,THE YEOMANRY.,"country, and it was her daily prayer that he might never be called"
7737,THE YEOMANRY.,"out, as he had so many enemies and old grudges in the neighbourhood,"
7738,THE YEOMANRY.,there would be sure to be murder on one side or the other. For my own
7739,THE YEOMANRY.,"part,” she concluded, “I think the Parliament is quite right in these"
7740,THE YEOMANRY.,"hard times to turn the farmers’ swords again into ploughshares, for"
7741,THE YEOMANRY.,they have less to care about the rising of rioters than the falling
7742,THE YEOMANRY.,of wheat.” The old lady then hunted out what she called a yeomanry
7743,THE YEOMANRY.,"letter from her husband’s brother, and having her permission to make it"
7744,THE YEOMANRY.,"public, I have thought proper to christen it."

7791,OLD MORTALITY.,"a ramrod, which old Clinker, the blacksmith, forgot to take out of"
7792,OLD MORTALITY.,his piece.
7793,OLD MORTALITY.,
7794,OLD MORTALITY.,[Illustration: SEEING A REVIEW.]
7795,OLD MORTALITY.,
7796,OLD MORTALITY.,"We mustard very strong,--about sixty--besides two volunteers, one"
7797,OLD MORTALITY.,"an invalid, because he had been ordered to ride for exercise, and"
7798,OLD MORTALITY.,"the other because he had nothing else to do, and he did nothing"
7799,OLD MORTALITY.,when he came. We must have been a disagreeable site to eyes as is
7800,OLD MORTALITY.,"unaffected towards Government,--though how Hopper’s horse would"
7801,OLD MORTALITY.,"behave in putting down riots I can’t guess, for he did nothing"
7802,OLD MORTALITY.,"but make revolutions himself, as if he was still in the thrashing"
7803,OLD MORTALITY.,"mill. But you know yeomanry an’t reglers, and can’t be expected"
7804,OLD MORTALITY.,to be veterans all at once. The worst of our mistakes was about
7805,OLD MORTALITY.,"the cullers. Old Ensign Cobb, of the White Horse, has a Political"
7806,OLD MORTALITY.,"Union club meets at his house, and when he came to unfurl, he had"
7807,OLD MORTALITY.,"brought the wrong flag: instead of “Royal Bumper Daggle,” it was"
7808,OLD MORTALITY.,“No Boromongers.” It made a reglar horse laugh among the cavalry;
7809,OLD MORTALITY.,"and old Cobb took such dudgeon at us, he deserted home to the White"
7810,OLD MORTALITY.,"Horse, and cut the concern without drawing a sword. The Captain"
7811,OLD MORTALITY.,"ordered Jack Blower to sound the recall to him, but some wag on the"
7812,OLD MORTALITY.,rout had stuck a bung up his trumpet; and he gallopped off just as
7813,OLD MORTALITY.,"crusty about it as old Cobb. Our next trouble was with Simkin, but"
7814,OLD MORTALITY.,you know he is anything but Simkin and Martial. He rid one of his
7815,OLD MORTALITY.,own docked waggon-horses--but for appearance sake had tied on a
7816,OLD MORTALITY.,"long regulation false tale, that made his horse kick astonishing,"
7817,OLD MORTALITY.,till his four loose shoes flew off like a game at koits. Of course
7818,OLD MORTALITY.,"nobody liked to stand nigh him, and he was obliged to be drawn up"
7819,OLD MORTALITY.,"in single order by himself, but not having any one to talk to, he"
7820,OLD MORTALITY.,"soon got weary of it, and left the ground. This was some excuse"
7821,OLD MORTALITY.,"for him--but not for Dale, that deserted from his company,--some"
7822,OLD MORTALITY.,"said his horse bolted with him, but I’ll swear I seed him spur."
7823,OLD MORTALITY.,"Up to this we had only one more deserter, and that was Marks, on"
7824,OLD MORTALITY.,"his iron-gray mare, for she heard her foal whinnying at home, and"
7825,OLD MORTALITY.,attended to that call more than to a deaf and dumb trumpet. Biggs
7826,OLD MORTALITY.,"didn’t come at all; he had his nag stole that very morning, as it"
7827,OLD MORTALITY.,"was waiting for him, pistols and all."
7828,OLD MORTALITY.,
7829,OLD MORTALITY.,What with these goings off and gaps our ranks got in such disorder
7830,OLD MORTALITY.,"that the Earl, tho’ he is a Tory, was obliged to act as a rank"
7831,OLD MORTALITY.,"Reformer. We got into line middling well, as far as the different"
7832,OLD MORTALITY.,"sizes of our horses would admit, and the Duke rode up and down us,"
7833,OLD MORTALITY.,and I am sorry to say was compelled to a reprimand. Morgan Giles
7834,OLD MORTALITY.,"had been at a fox-hunt the day before, and persisted in wearing the"
7835,OLD MORTALITY.,"brush as a feather in his cap. As fox tails isn’t regulation, his"
7836,OLD MORTALITY.,"Grace ordered it out, but Morgan was very high, and at last threw"
7837,OLD MORTALITY.,"up his commission into a tree and trotted home to Wickham Hall,"
7838,OLD MORTALITY.,"along with private Dick, who, as Morgan’s whipper in, thought he"
7839,OLD MORTALITY.,was under obligations to follow his master.
7840,OLD MORTALITY.,
7841,OLD MORTALITY.,"We got thro’ sword exercise decent well,--only Barber shaved"
7842,OLD MORTALITY.,"Croft’s mare with his saber, which he needn’t have done, as she was"
7843,OLD MORTALITY.,clipt before; and Holdsworth slashed off his cob’s off ear. It
7844,OLD MORTALITY.,was cut and run with her in course; and I hope he got safe home.
7845,OLD MORTALITY.,"We don’t know what Hawksley might have thrusted, as his sword"
7846,OLD MORTALITY.,"objected to be called out in wet weather, and stuck to its sheath"
7847,OLD MORTALITY.,like pitch; but he went thro’ all the cuts very correct with his
7848,OLD MORTALITY.,"umbrella. For my own part, candour compels to state I swished off"
7849,OLD MORTALITY.,"my left hand man’s feather; but tho’ it might have been worse,"
7850,OLD MORTALITY.,"and I apologised as well as I could for my horse fretting, he was"
7851,OLD MORTALITY.,"foolish enough to huff at, and swear was done on purpose, and so"
7852,OLD MORTALITY.,"gallopped home, I suspect, to write me a calling out challenge."
7853,OLD MORTALITY.,"Challenge or not, if I fight him with anything but fists, I’m not"
7854,OLD MORTALITY.,"one of the Yeomanry. An accident’s an accident, and much more"
7855,OLD MORTALITY.,pardonable than Hawksley opening his umbrella plump in the face of
7856,OLD MORTALITY.,the Captain’s blood charger; and ten times more mortifying for an
7857,OLD MORTALITY.,"officer to be carried back willy-nilly to Ashford, in the middle"
7858,OLD MORTALITY.,"of the Review. Luckily before Hawksley frightened any more, he was"
7859,OLD MORTALITY.,"called off to hold his umbrella over Mrs. H., as Mrs. Morgan had"
7860,OLD MORTALITY.,"taken in nine ladies, and could not accommodate more in her close"
7861,OLD MORTALITY.,"carriage, without making it too close."
7862,OLD MORTALITY.,
7863,OLD MORTALITY.,"After sword exercise we shot pistols, and I must say, very well"
7864,OLD MORTALITY.,"and distinct; only, old Dunn didn’t fire; but he’s deaf as a post,"
7865,OLD MORTALITY.,"and I wonder how he was called out. Talking of volleys, I am sorry"
7866,OLD MORTALITY.,to say we fired one before without word of command; but it was all
7867,OLD MORTALITY.,"thro’ Day on his shooting pony putting up a partridge, and in the"
7868,OLD MORTALITY.,"heat of the moment letting fly, and as he is our fugleman we all"
7869,OLD MORTALITY.,"did the same. Lucky for the bird it was very strong on the wing,"
7870,OLD MORTALITY.,or the troop must have brought it down; howsomever the Earl looked
7871,OLD MORTALITY.,"very grave, and said something that Day didn’t choose to take from"
7872,OLD MORTALITY.,"him, being a qualified man, and taking out a reglar license, so"
7873,OLD MORTALITY.,"he went off to his own ground, where he might shoot without being"
7874,OLD MORTALITY.,"called to account. Contrary to reason and expectation, there was"
7875,OLD MORTALITY.,very few horses shied at the firing; but we saw Bluff lying full
7876,OLD MORTALITY.,"length, and was afraid it was a bust; but we found his horse,"
7877,OLD MORTALITY.,"being a very quiet one, had run away from the noise. He was throwd"
7878,OLD MORTALITY.,"on his back in the mud, but refused to leave the ground. Being a"
7879,OLD MORTALITY.,"man of spirit, and military inclind, he got up behind Bates; but"
7880,OLD MORTALITY.,"Bates’s horse objecting to such back-gammon, reared and threw"
7881,OLD MORTALITY.,"doublets. As his knees was broke, Bates and Bluff was forced to"
7882,OLD MORTALITY.,"lead him away, and the troop lost two more men, tho’ for once"
7883,OLD MORTALITY.,against their own wills.
7884,OLD MORTALITY.,
7885,OLD MORTALITY.,"As for Roper he had bragged how he could stand fire, but seeing a"
7886,OLD MORTALITY.,"great light over the village, he set off full Swing to look after"
7887,OLD MORTALITY.,his ricks and barns.
7888,OLD MORTALITY.,
7889,OLD MORTALITY.,"The next thing to be done was charging, and between you and me, I"
7890,OLD MORTALITY.,"was most anxious about that, as many of us could only ride up to"
7891,OLD MORTALITY.,a certain _pitch_. As you’ve often been throwd you’ll know what I
7892,OLD MORTALITY.,"mean: to tell the truth, when the word came, I seed some lay hold"
7893,OLD MORTALITY.,"of their saddles, but Barnes had better have laid hold of anything"
7894,OLD MORTALITY.,"else in the world, for it turn’d round with him at the first"
7895,OLD MORTALITY.,"start. Simpkin fell at the same time insensibly, but the doctor"
7896,OLD MORTALITY.,dismounted and was very happy to attend him without making any
7897,OLD MORTALITY.,"charge whatever. All the rest went off gallantly, either gallopping"
7898,OLD MORTALITY.,"or cantering, tho’ as they say at Canterbury races, their was"
7899,OLD MORTALITY.,some wonderful tailing on account of the difference of the nags.
7900,OLD MORTALITY.,"Grimsby’s mare was the last of the lot, and for her backwardness in"
7901,OLD MORTALITY.,"charging we called her the Mare of Bristol, but he took the jest"
7902,OLD MORTALITY.,"no better than Cobb did, and when we wheel’d to the right he was"
7903,OLD MORTALITY.,"left. Between friends, I was not sorry when the word came to pull"
7904,OLD MORTALITY.,"up,--such crossing, and josling, and foul riding; but two farmers"
7905,OLD MORTALITY.,"seemed to like it, for they never halted when the rest did, but"
7906,OLD MORTALITY.,gallopped on out of sight. I have since heard they had matched
7907,OLD MORTALITY.,their two nags the day before to run two miles for a sovereign;
7908,OLD MORTALITY.,I don’t think a sovereign should divert a man from his king: but
7909,OLD MORTALITY.,"I can’t write the result as they newer came back,--I suppose on"
7910,OLD MORTALITY.,"account of the wet. The rains, to speak cavalry like, had got"
7911,OLD MORTALITY.,beyond bearing rains; and when we formed line again it was like a
7912,OLD MORTALITY.,"laundress’s clothes line, for there wasn’t a dry shirt on it. One"
7913,OLD MORTALITY.,"man on a lame horse rode particularly restive, and objected in such"
7914,OLD MORTALITY.,"critical weather to a long review. He wouldn’t be cholera morbus’d,"
7915,OLD MORTALITY.,"he said, for Duke or Devil, but should put his horse up, and go"
7916,OLD MORTALITY.,home by the blue Stage; by way of answer he was ordered to give up
7917,OLD MORTALITY.,"his arms and his jacket, which he did very off hand, as it was wet"
7918,OLD MORTALITY.,thro’. Howsomever it was thought prudent to dispense with us till
7919,OLD MORTALITY.,"fine weather, so we was formed into a circle--9 bobble square, and"
7920,OLD MORTALITY.,"the Duke thanked us in a short speech for being so regular, and"
7921,OLD MORTALITY.,"loyal, and soldier-like, after which every man that had kept his"
7922,OLD MORTALITY.,seat gave three cheers.
7923,OLD MORTALITY.,
7924,OLD MORTALITY.,[Illustration: AN OBJECTION TO CROSSING THE LINE.]
7925,OLD MORTALITY.,
7926,OLD MORTALITY.,"On the whole the thing might have been very gratifying, but on"
7927,OLD MORTALITY.,"reviewing the Field day, the asthmas and agues are uncommonly"
7928,OLD MORTALITY.,"numerous, and to say nothing of the horses that are amiss with"
7929,OLD MORTALITY.,coffs and colds--there are three dead and seven lame for life. The
7930,OLD MORTALITY.,"Earl has been very much blamed under the rose among the privates,"
7931,OLD MORTALITY.,"for fixing on a Hunting day, which I forgot to say, carried away a"
7932,OLD MORTALITY.,dozen that were mounted on their hunters. I am sorry to say there
7933,OLD MORTALITY.,"was so few left at the end of all, as to suffer themselves to be"
7934,OLD MORTALITY.,"hissed into the town by the little boys and gals, and called the"
7935,OLD MORTALITY.,"Horse Gomerils; and that consequently the corpse, as a body, is as"
7936,OLD MORTALITY.,good as defunct. Not that there were many resign’d at the end of
7937,OLD MORTALITY.,"the review, as his Lordship gave a grand dinner on the following"
7938,OLD MORTALITY.,"day to the troop: but I am sorry to say, a great many was so"
7939,OLD MORTALITY.,unhandsome as to throw up the very day after. The common excuse
7940,OLD MORTALITY.,among them was something of not liking to wet their swords against
7941,OLD MORTALITY.,their countrymen.
7942,OLD MORTALITY.,
7943,OLD MORTALITY.,"For my own part as the yomanry cannot go on, I shall stick to it"
7944,OLD MORTALITY.,"honorably, and as any man of spirit would do in my case; but dont"
7945,OLD MORTALITY.,"be afraid of my attending Market, come what will, and selling the"

7953,JAMES CHERRY.,"ride with spurs, because, he said, they made his horse prick his"
7954,JAMES CHERRY.,"ears. Our poor corps, small as it is, I understand is like to act"
7955,JAMES CHERRY.,in divisions. Some wish to be infantry instead of cavalry; and the
7956,JAMES CHERRY.,farmers from the hop grounds want to be Polish Lancers.
7957,JAMES CHERRY.,
7958,JAMES CHERRY.,"I have just learned Ballard, and nine more of the men, was ordered"
7959,JAMES CHERRY.,to keep the ground; but it seems they left before the Troop came on
7960,JAMES CHERRY.,"it. They say in excuse, they stood in the rain till they were ready"
7961,JAMES CHERRY.,"to drop; and as we didn’t come an hour after time, they thought"
7962,JAMES CHERRY.,"everything was postponed. “None but the brave,” they said, “deserve"
7963,JAMES CHERRY.,"the fair;” and till it _was_ fair, they wouldn’t attend again."
7964,JAMES CHERRY.,
7965,JAMES CHERRY.,"The mare you lent Ballard, I am sorry to say, got kicked in"
7966,JAMES CHERRY.,"several places, and had her shoulder put out; we was advised to"
7967,JAMES CHERRY.,"give her a swim in the sea, and I am still more sorry to say, in"
7968,JAMES CHERRY.,"swimming her we drowned her. As for my own nag, I am afraid he has"
7969,JAMES CHERRY.,"got string-halt; but one comfort is, I think it diverts him from"
7970,JAMES CHERRY.,kicking.

8158,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"audience, that I was taken out of all speaking parts, for fear of"

8162,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"never expected to appear before the curtain, but to make myself useful"
8163,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"among the carpenters and scene-shifters. That Christmas, during the"
8164,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"rehearsal of a Pantomime, four of us were set to catch an Harlequin,"
8165,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"each to hold the corner of a blanket, and be ready for his jump"
8166,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"through the scene. Alas! one gentleman brought his pot, and one his"

8168,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,one draining the last drops of stout from the pewter. I alone upheld
8169,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"my corner from the boards, when the awful leap came on us, like a"
8170,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"star-shoot. I still see the momentary gleam of that strait, spangled,"
8171,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"fish-like, head-long figure. Can, candle, bottle, pipes, all crashed"
8172,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"beneath the heavy tumbler. With a torrent of apologies, we scrambled"
8173,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"up in the dark, to raise the fallen hero; but there he lay, on his"
8174,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"face, with legs and arms outspread, as we could feel, without sense,"
8175,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"or sound, or motion, cold, stiff, and _dead_! For an instant all was"
8176,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,horrid silence; we were as breathless as he. I resolved to give myself
8177,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"up to justice, yet found voice in the boldness of innocence to shout"
8178,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"“Help! Lights! All his bones are broken!” “And all yours _shall_ be,"
8179,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,ye dogs!” cried a voice. We looked up; there stood one Harlequin over
8180,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"us alive; there lay another under us, without a chance of ever more"
8181,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,peeping through the blanket of the dark. That the speaker was no ghost
8182,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"we were soon convinced, as his magic bat battered us. The truth was, he"
8183,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"had thrown at us the stuffed Harlequin used in flying ascents, to try"
8184,“LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP.”,"our vigilance, before he risked his own neck. I felt, however, that I"

8331,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8332,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8333,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,I was once--for a few hours only--in the militia. I suspect I was in
8334,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,part answerable for my own mishap. There is a story in Joe Miller of
8335,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"a man, who, being _pressed_ to serve his Majesty on another element,"
8336,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"pleaded his polite breeding, to the gang, as a good ground of"
8337,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,exemption: but was told that the crew being a set of sad unmannerly
8338,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"dogs, a Chesterfield was the very character they wanted. The"
8339,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"militia-men acted, I presume, on the same principle. Their customary"
8340,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"schedule was forwarded to me, at Brighton, to fill up, and in a moment"
8341,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"of incautious hilarity--induced, perhaps, by the absence of all"
8342,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"business or employment, except pleasure--I wrote myself down in the"
8343,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,descriptive column as “_Quite a Gentleman_.”
8344,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8345,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"The consequence followed immediately. A precept, addressed by the High"
8346,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"Constable of Westminster to the Low ditto of the parish of St. M*****,"
8347,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"and endorsed with my name, informed me that it had turned up in that"
8348,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"involuntary lottery, the Ballot."
8349,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8350,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"At sight of the Orderly, who thought proper to deliver the document"
8351,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"into no other hands than mine, my mother-in-law cried, and my wife"
8352,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,fainted on the spot. They had no notion of any distinctions in military
8353,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"service--a soldier was a soldier--and they imagined that, on the very"
8354,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"morrow, I might be ordered abroad to a fresh Waterloo. They were"
8355,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,unfortunately ignorant of that benevolent provision which absolved the
8356,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,militia from going out of the kingdom--“except in case of an invasion.”
8357,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,In vain I represented that we were “locals;” they had heard of local
8358,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"diseases, and thought there might be wounds of the same description. In"
8359,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,vain I explained that we were not troops of the line;--they could see
8360,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"nothing to choose between being shot in a line, or in any other figure."
8361,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,I told them next that I was not obliged to serve myself; but they
8362,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"answered, “’twas so much the harder I should be obliged to serve any"
8363,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"one else.” My being sent abroad, they said, would be the death of them;"
8364,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"for they had witnessed, at Ramsgate, the embarkation of the Walcheren"
8365,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"expedition, and too well remembered “the misery of the soldiers’ wives"
8366,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,at seeing their husbands in _transports_!”
8367,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8368,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"I told them that, at the very worst, if I _should_ be sent abroad,"
8369,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,there was no reason why I should not return again; but they both
8370,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"declared, they never did, and never would believe in those “Returns of"
8371,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,the Killed and Wounded.”
8372,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8373,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,The discussion was in this stage when it was interrupted by another
8374,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"loud single knock at the door, a report equal in its effects on us to"
8375,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,that of the memorable cannon-shot at Brussels; and before we could
8376,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"recover ourselves, a strapping Serjeant entered the parlour with a huge"
8377,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"bow, or rather rain-bow, of party-coloured ribbons in his cap. He came,"
8378,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,he said to offer a substitute for me; but I was prevented from reply by
8379,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"the indignant females asking him in the same breath, “Who and what did"
8380,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,he think _could_ be a substitute for a son and a husband?”
8381,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8382,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,The poor Serjeant looked foolish enough at this turn; but he was still
8383,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,more abashed when the two anxious Ladies began to cross-examine him
8384,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"on the length of his services abroad, and the number of his wounds,"
8385,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,the campaigns of the Militia-man having been confined doubtless to
8386,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"Hounslow, and his bodily marks militant to the three stripes on his"
8387,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,sleeve. Parrying these awkward questions he endeavoured to prevail upon
8388,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"me to see the proposed proxy, a fine young fellow, he assured me, of"
8389,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,unusual stature; but I told him it was quite an indifferent point with
8390,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"me whether he was 6-feet-2 or 2-feet-6, in short whether he was as tall"
8391,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,as the flag or “under the standard.”
8392,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8393,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"The truth is, I reflected that it was a time of profound peace, that a"
8394,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"civil war, or an invasion, was very unlikely; and as for an occasional"
8395,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"drill, that I could make shift, like Lavater, to right-about-face."
8396,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8397,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"Accordingly I declined seeing the substitute, and dismissed the"
8398,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,Serjeant with a note to the War-Secretary to this purport:--“That
8399,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,I considered myself _drawn_; and expected therefore to be well
8400,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"_quarter’d_. That, under the circumstances of the country, it would"
8401,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,probably be unnecessary for militia-men ‘to be mustarded;’ but that
8402,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"if his Majesty did ‘_call me out_,’ I hoped I should ‘_give him"
8403,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,satisfaction_.’”
8404,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8405,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,The females were far from being pleased with this billet. They talked
8406,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"a great deal of moral suicide, wilful murder, and seeking the bubble"
8407,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,reputation in the cannon’s mouth; but I shall ever think that I took
8408,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"the proper course, for, after the lapse of a few hours, two more of"
8409,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"the General’s red-coats, or General postmen, brought me a large packet"
8410,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"sealed with the War-office Seal, and superscribed “Henry Hardinge;” by"
8411,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"which I was officially absolved from serving on Horse, or on Foot, or"
8412,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"on both together, then and thereafter."
8413,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,
8414,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"And why, I know not--unless his Majesty doubted the handsomeness of"
8415,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"discharging me in particular, without letting off the rest;--but so it"
8416,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"was, that in a short time afterwards there issued a proclamation, by"
8417,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,which the services of all militia-men were for the present dispensed
8418,DRAWN FOR A SOLDIER.,"with,--and we were left to pursue our several avocations,--of course,"

8986,THE WOODEN LEG.,"somewhere at Seringapatam, its twin-brother being at this moment under"

8988,THE WOODEN LEG.,"deprived of half of the implements for marching, I equitably retired,"
8989,THE WOODEN LEG.,"on half-pay, from a marching regiment, and embarked what remained"
8990,THE WOODEN LEG.,"of my body, for the land of its nativity, literally fulfilling the"
8991,THE WOODEN LEG.,"description of man, “with one foot on sea and one on shore,” in the"

8994,THE WOODEN LEG.,A great deal has been said and sung of our wooden walls and hearts of

8999,THE WOODEN LEG.,"I might have walked in a dead calm, and as a soldier accustomed to"
9000,THE WOODEN LEG.,"exercise, and moreover a foot soldier, and used to walking, I felt a"
9001,THE WOODEN LEG.,"great inclination to pace up and down the deck, but a general protest"
9002,THE WOODEN LEG.,"from the cabins put an end to my promenade. As Lear recommends, my"
9003,THE WOODEN LEG.,wooden hoofs ought to have been “shod with felt.”
9004,THE WOODEN LEG.,
9005,THE WOODEN LEG.,"At last the voyage terminated, and in my eagerness to land, I got"

9007,THE WOODEN LEG.,"have enjoyed a ramble over its extensive shingle, will believe that"
9008,THE WOODEN LEG.,I soon obtained abundance of exercise in walking with a wooden leg
9009,THE WOODEN LEG.,"among its loose pebbles; in fact, when I arrived at Lydd, I was, as"

9021,THE WOODEN LEG.,"scours the plain,” she does not do it with sand. At last I stood at"
9022,THE WOODEN LEG.,"the lodge-gate, which opened, and let me into a long avenue, the path"
9023,THE WOODEN LEG.,"of which had been newly gravelled, but not well rolled; accordingly,"
9024,THE WOODEN LEG.,"I cut out considerable work for myself and the gardener, who, as he"
9025,THE WOODEN LEG.,"watched the holes I picked in his performance, seemed to look on my"
9026,THE WOODEN LEG.,"advance much as Apollyon did on Pilgrim’s Progress. By way of relief,"
9027,THE WOODEN LEG.,"I got upon the grass, but my wooden leg, though it was a blackleg,"
9028,THE WOODEN LEG.,"did not thrive much upon the turf. Arrived at the house door, filial"
9029,THE WOODEN LEG.,"anxiety caused me to forget to scrape and wipe, and I proceeded to make"
9030,THE WOODEN LEG.,a fishy pattern of soles and dabs up the stair carpet. The good wife in
9031,THE WOODEN LEG.,the Scotch song says--
9032,THE WOODEN LEG.,

9034,THE WOODEN LEG.,As he comes up the stair.”
9035,THE WOODEN LEG.,
9036,THE WOODEN LEG.,"If there was any music in mine, it was in the stump, which played a"
9037,THE WOODEN LEG.,"sort of “Dead March in Saul,” up to the landing-place, where the sound"
9038,THE WOODEN LEG.,and sight of my Birnam wood coming to Dunsinane threw my poor mother
9039,THE WOODEN LEG.,"into a Macbeth fit of horror, for the preparatory letter which should"
9040,THE WOODEN LEG.,"have broken my leg to her, had been lost on its passage. As for my"
9041,THE WOODEN LEG.,"father, I will not attempt to describe his transport, for I came upon"
9042,THE WOODEN LEG.,"him,"
9043,THE WOODEN LEG.,
9044,THE WOODEN LEG.,“As fools rush in where angels fear to tread;”
9045,THE WOODEN LEG.,
9046,THE WOODEN LEG.,and Gabriel or Michael would not have escaped a volley for treading on
9047,THE WOODEN LEG.,"his gouty foot. At the same moment, Margaret and Louisa, with sisterly"
9048,THE WOODEN LEG.,"impetuosity, threw themselves on my neck, and not being attentive to my"
9049,THE WOODEN LEG.,"“outplay or loose leg,” according to Sir Thomas Parkyn’s “Instructions"
9050,THE WOODEN LEG.,"for Wrestling,” the result was a “hanging trippet.” “A hanging trippet"
9051,THE WOODEN LEG.,"is when you put your toe behind your adversary’s heel, on the same"
9052,THE WOODEN LEG.,"side, with a design to hook his leg up forwards, and throw him on his"
9053,THE WOODEN LEG.,back.”
9054,THE WOODEN LEG.,
9055,THE WOODEN LEG.,"The reader will guess my satisfaction when night came, and allowed"
9056,THE WOODEN LEG.,me to rid myself of my unlucky limb. Fatigued with my walk through
9057,THE WOODEN LEG.,"dry sand and wet gravel, exhausted by excessive emotion, and, maybe,"
9058,THE WOODEN LEG.,"a little flustered by dipping into the cup of welcome, I literally"
9059,THE WOODEN LEG.,"tumbled into bed, and was soon dreaming of running races and leaping"
9060,THE WOODEN LEG.,"for wagers, gallopading, waltzing, and other feats of a biped, when I"
9061,THE WOODEN LEG.,was suddenly aroused by shrill screams of “Thieves!” and “Murder!” with
9062,THE WOODEN LEG.,"a more hoarse call for “Frank! Frank!” There were burglars, in fact,"
9063,THE WOODEN LEG.,"in the house, who were packing and preparing to elope with the family"
9064,THE WOODEN LEG.,"plate, without the consent of parents. It was natural for the latter to"
9065,THE WOODEN LEG.,"call a son and a soldier to the rescue, but son or soldier never came"
9066,THE WOODEN LEG.,"in time to start for the plate; not that I wanted zeal or courage, or"
9067,THE WOODEN LEG.,"arms, but I wanted that unlucky limb, and I groped about a full half"
9068,THE WOODEN LEG.,"hour in the dark, before I could lay my hand upon my leg."
9069,THE WOODEN LEG.,
9070,THE WOODEN LEG.,The next morning I took a solitary stroll before breakfast to look at
9071,THE WOODEN LEG.,"the estate; but during my absence abroad, some exchanges of land had"
9072,THE WOODEN LEG.,"taken place with our neighbour, Sir Theophilus. The consequence was, in"
9073,THE WOODEN LEG.,"taking my wood through a wood of his, but which had formerly been our"
9074,THE WOODEN LEG.,"own, and going with my “best leg foremost,” as a man in my predicament"
9075,THE WOODEN LEG.,"always does, I popped it into a man-trap. Thus my timber failed me at a"
9076,THE WOODEN LEG.,pinch when it might really have stood my friend. Luckily the trap was
9077,THE WOODEN LEG.,one of the humane sort;--but it was far from pleasant to stand in it
9078,THE WOODEN LEG.,for two hours calling out for Leg Bail.
9079,THE WOODEN LEG.,
9080,THE WOODEN LEG.,"I could give many more instances of scrapes, besides the perpetual"
9081,THE WOODEN LEG.,"hobble which my wooden leg brought me into, but I will mention only"
9082,THE WOODEN LEG.,"one. At the persuasion of my friends, a few years ago, I stood for Rye,"
9083,THE WOODEN LEG.,"but the electors, perhaps, thought I only half stood for it, for they"
9084,THE WOODEN LEG.,gave me nothing but split votes. It was perhaps as well that I did not
9085,THE WOODEN LEG.,"go into the House, for with two such odd legs I could never properly"
9086,THE WOODEN LEG.,"have “paired off.” The election expenses, however, pressed, heavily on"
9087,THE WOODEN LEG.,"my pocket, and to defray them, and all for one Wooden Leg, I had to cut"
9088,THE WOODEN LEG.,down some thousand loads of timber.

9107,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,"But Brown and stout will both wear out,"
9108,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,"One Friday he died hard,"
9109,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,And left a widow’d wife to mourn
9110,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,At twenty pence a yard.
9111,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,
9112,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,Now widow B. in two short months
9113,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,Thought mourning quite a tax;
9114,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,"And wished, like Mr. Wilberforce,"
9115,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,To _manumit_ her blacks.
9116,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,
9117,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,With Mr. Street she soon was sweet;
9118,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,"The thing thus came about,"
9119,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,"She asked him in at home, and then"
9120,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,At church he asked her out!

9122,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,Assurance such as this the man

9126,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,
9127,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,One dreary night the angry sprite
9128,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,Appeared before her view;
9129,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,"It came a little after one,"
9130,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,But she was after two!
9131,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,
9132,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,"“Oh Mrs. B., oh Mrs. B.!"
9133,A VERY SERIOUS BALLAD.,"Are these your sorrow’s deeds,"

9188,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9189,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,“This is one of the _pest_ discretions.”--SIR HUGH EVANS.
9190,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9191,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9192,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"About five or six years after that deplorable great Plague of London,"
9193,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"there befel a circumstance which, as it is not set forth in Defoe his"
9194,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"history of the pestilence, I shall make bold to write down herein, not"
9195,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"only on account of the strangeness of the event, but also because it"
9196,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"carries a moral pick-a-back, as a good story ought to do."
9197,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9198,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"It is a notoriously known fact, as collected from the bills of"
9199,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"mortality, that there died of the plague in the mere metropolis"
9200,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,a matter of some hundreds of thousands of human souls; yet
9201,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"notwithstanding this most awful warning to evil doers, the land did"
9202,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"nevertheless bring forth such a rank crop of sin and wickedness,"
9203,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"that the like was never known before or after; the City of London,"
9204,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"especially, being overrun with bands of thieves and murtherers, against"
9205,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"whom there was little or no check, the civical police having been"
9206,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,utterly disbanded and disrupt during the ravages of the pestilence.
9207,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,Neither did men’s minds turn for some time towards the mere safeguard
9208,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"of property, being still distracted with personal fears, for although"
9209,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"the pest had, as it were, died of the excess of its own violence, yet"
9210,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,from time to time there arose flying rumours of fresh breakings out of
9211,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,the malady. The small-pox and the malignant fever being the prolific
9212,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,parents of such like alarms. Accordingly many notable robberies and
9213,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,divers grievous murthers having been acted with impunity during the
9214,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"horrible crisis of the pest, those which had before been wicked were"
9215,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"now hardened, and became a thousand times worse, till the city and the"
9216,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"neighbourhood thereof seemed given in prey to devils, who had been"
9217,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,loosened for a season from the everlasting fetters of the law.
9218,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9219,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,Now four of these desperadoes having met together at the Dolphin in
9220,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"Deptford, they laid a plot together to rob a certain lone mansion house"
9221,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"which stood betwixt the Thames marshes and the Forest of Hainault, and"
9222,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"which was left in the charge of only one man, the family being gone"
9223,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"off to another mansion house in the county of Wiltshire, for the sake"
9224,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,of a more wholesome air. And the manner of the plot was this: one of
9225,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,the villains going in a feigned voice was to knock at the front-door
9226,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"and beg piteously for a night’s shelter, and then the door, being"
9227,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"opened, the other knaves were to rush in and bind the serving-man, or"
9228,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"murther him, as might seem best, and so taking his keys they were to"
9229,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"ransack the house, where they expected to find a good store of plate."
9230,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"Accordingly, one Friday, at the dead of the night, they set forth,"
9231,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"having for leader a fellow that was named Blackface, by reason of a"
9232,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"vizard which he wore always on such errands, diverting themselves by"
9233,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,the way with laying out each man his share of the booty in the manner
9234,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"that pleased him best, wine and the women of Lewkener’s Lane coming"
9235,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,in you may be sure for the main burthen of the song. At last they
9236,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"entered the fore-court of the house which they were to rob, and which"
9237,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"was as silent as death, and as dark, excepting a glimmer from one"
9238,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"window towards the top. Blackface then, as agreed upon, began to beat"
9239,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"at the door, but being flushed with drink, instead of entreating for"
9240,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"an entrance, he shouted out to the serving-man, bidding him with many"
9241,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"terrible oaths to come down and to render up his keys, for that they"
9242,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,were come to relieve him of his charge.
9243,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9244,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"“In the name of God, my masters,” cried the serving-man from the"
9245,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"window, “what do you want here?”"
9246,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9247,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"“We are come,” returned Blackface, “to relieve you of your trust, so"
9248,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,throw us down your keys.”
9249,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9250,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"“An that be all,” said the serving-man, whose name was Adams, “wait but"
9251,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,a little while and you shall have the keys and my place to boot. Come
9252,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"again but a few hours hence, and you shall find me dead, when you may"
9253,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,do with me and my trust as you list.”
9254,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9255,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"“Come, come,” cries Blackface, “no preaching, but come down and open,"
9256,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,or we will bring fire and faggot to the door.”
9257,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9258,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"“Ye shall not need,” answered Adams, “hearken only to what I say, and"
9259,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"you shall have free passage; but I give you fair warning, though I"
9260,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"be but a single man, and without weapon, and sick even unto death,"
9261,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,yet shall your coming in cost you as many lives as ye bear amongst
9262,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"you, for within these walls there is a dismal giant that hath slain"
9263,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"his thousands, even the plague.” At these dreary words the courage of"
9264,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"the robbers was taken somewhat aback, but Blackface spirited them on,"
9265,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,saying it was no doubt an invention to deter them from the spoil.
9266,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9267,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"“Alas,” answered Adams, who overheard their argument, “what I say is"
9268,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"the solemn and sorrowful truth, and which I am speaking for the last"
9269,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"time, for I shall never see to-morrow’s blessed sun. As for the door,"
9270,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"I will open it to you with my own hands, beseeching you for your own"
9271,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"sakes to stand a little apart, and out of the taint of my breath, which"
9272,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"is sure destruction. There is one child herein a dead corpse, as you"
9273,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"shall behold if you have so much courage, for it lieth unburied in the"
9274,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"hall.” So saying he descended, and presently flung open the hall door,"
9275,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"the villains withdrawing a little backward, and they saw verily by the"
9276,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"light of a rush wick which he carried, that he was lapt only in a white"
9277,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"sheet, and looking very pale and ghost-like, with a most dismal black"
9278,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,circle round each of his eyes.
9279,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9280,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,[Illustration: THE COMMON LOT.]
9281,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9282,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"“If ye disbelieve me still,” he said, “look inwards when I draw back"
9283,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"from the door, and ye shall see what was a living child this day, but"
9284,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,is now a corpse hastening to corruption. Alas! in the midst of life we
9285,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"are in death: she was seized at play.” With these words he drew aside,"
9286,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"and the robbers looking through the door, perceived it was even as"
9287,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"he said, for the dead body of the child was lying on the hall table,"
9288,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"with the same black ring round its eyes, and dressed in brocade and"
9289,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"riband as though death had carried it off, even as he said, in its"
9290,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"holiday clothes. “Now,” said Adams, after they had gazed awhile, “here"
9291,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"be the keys,” therewithal casting towards them a huge bunch; but the"
9292,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,villains would now no more meddle with them than with so many aspics or
9293,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"scorpions, looking on them in truth as the very keys of death’s door."
9294,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"Accordingly, after venting a few curses on their ill luck, they began"
9295,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"to depart in very ill humour, when Adams again called to them to hear"
9296,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,his last words.
9297,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,
9298,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"“Now,” said he, “though ye came hither with robbery, and perchance"
9299,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"murder in your hearts, against me, yet as a true Christian will I"
9300,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"not only forgive your wicked intents, but advise you how to shun"
9301,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,that miserable end which my own life is coming to so very suddenly.
9302,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"Although your souls have been saved from sin, yet, doubtless ye have"
9303,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,not stood so long in this infected air without peril to the health of
9304,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"your bodies, wherefore, by the advice of a dying man, go straightway"
9305,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"from this over to Laytonstone, where there be tan pits, and sit there"
9306,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"for a good hour amidst the strong smell of the tan, and which hath"
9307,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"more virtue as a remedy against the infection of the plague, than even"
9308,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"tobacco or the odour of drugs. Do this and live, for the poison is"
9309,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"strong and subtle, and seizeth, ere one can be aware, on the springs"
9310,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"of life.” Thereupon he uttered a dismal groan, and began yelling so"
9311,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"fearfully that the robbers with one accord took to flight, and never"
9312,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"stopped till they were come to Laytonstone, and into the tanner’s"
9313,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"very yard, where they sat down and stooped over the pit, snuffing up"
9314,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,the odours with all the relish of men in whose nostrils it was as the
9315,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"breath of life. In which posture they had been sitting half an hour,"
9316,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"when there entered several persons with a lantern, and which they took"
9317,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"to be the tanner and his men, and to whom, therefore, they addressed"
9318,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"themselves, begging pardon for their boldness, and entreating leave to"
9319,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,continue awhile in the tan-yard to disinfect themselves of the plague;
9320,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"but they had hardly uttered these words, when lo! each man was suddenly"
9321,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"seized upon, and bound in a twinkling, the constables, for such they"
9322,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"were, jeering them withal, and saying the plague had been too busy to"
9323,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"come itself, but had sent them a gallows and a halter instead, which"
9324,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"would serve their turn. Whereupon, most of the rogues became very"
9325,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"chop-fallen, but Blackface swore he could die easy but for one thing"
9326,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"upon his mind, and that was, what had become of the dead child and the"
9327,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"man dying of the plague, both of which he had seen with his own eyes."
9328,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"Hereupon, the man with a lantern turned the light upon his own face,"
9329,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"which the rogues knew directly to be the countenance of Adams himself,"
9330,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"but without any of those black rings round the eyes, and for which"
9331,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,he explained he had been indebted to a little charcoal. “As for the
9332,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"dead child,” he said, “you must enquire, my masters, of the worshipful"
9333,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"company of Barber Surgeons, and they will tell you of a certain waxen"
9334,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"puppet of Hygeia, the Goddess of Health, which used to be carried at"
9335,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"their pageants, and when it fell into disuse was purchased of them by"
9336,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"my Lady Dame Ellinor Wood, for a plaything to her own children. So one"
9337,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"head you see is worth four pair of hands, and your whole gang, tall,"
9338,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,"and strong knaves though you be, have been overmatched by one old man"
9339,A TALE OF THE GREAT PLAGUE.,and a doll.”

9477,"SIR,",
9478,"SIR,",In one of your Annuals you have given insertion to “A Plan for
9479,"SIR,",Writing Blank Verse in Rhyme;” but as I have seen no regular long
9480,"SIR,","poem constructed on its principles, I suppose the scheme did not"
9481,"SIR,",take with the literary world. Under these circumstances I feel
9482,"SIR,","encouraged to bring forward a novelty of my own, and I can only"
9483,"SIR,","regret that such poets as Chaucer and Cottle, Spenser and Hayley,"
9484,"SIR,","Milton and Pratt, Pope and Pye, Byron and Batterbee, should have"
9485,"SIR,",died before it was invented.
9486,"SIR,",
9487,"SIR,",The great difficulty in verse is avowedly the rhyme. Dean
9488,"SIR,","Swift says somewhere in his letters, “that a rhyme is as hard"
9489,"SIR,","to find with him as a guinea,”--and we all know that guineas"
9490,"SIR,",are proverbially scarce among poets. The merest versifier that
9491,"SIR,","ever attempted a Valentine must have met with this Orson, some"
9492,"SIR,",untameable savage syllable that refused to chime in with society.
9493,"SIR,","For instance, what poetical Foxhunter--a contributor to the"
9494,"SIR,","Sporting Magazine--has not drawn all the covers of Beynard Ceynard,"
9495,"SIR,","Deynard, Feynard, Geynard, Heynard, Keynard, Leynard, Meynard,"
9496,"SIR,","Neynard, Peynard, Queynard, to find a rhyme for Reynard? The spirit"
9497,"SIR,",of the times is decidedly against Tithe; and I know of no tithe
9498,"SIR,","more oppressive than that poetical one, in heroic measure, which"
9499,"SIR,",requires that every tenth syllable shall pay a sound in kind. How
9500,"SIR,","often the Poet goes up a line, only to be stopped at the end by"
9501,"SIR,","an impracticable rhyme, like a bull in a blind alley! I have an"
9502,"SIR,","ingenious medical friend, who might have been an eminent poet by"
9503,"SIR,","this time, but the first line he wrote ended in ipecacuanha, and"
9504,"SIR,","with all his physical and mental power, he has never yet been able"
9505,"SIR,",to find a rhyme for it.
9506,"SIR,",
9507,"SIR,","The plan I propose aims to obviate this hardship. My system is, to"
9508,"SIR,","take the bull by the horns; in short, to try at first what words"
9509,"SIR,","will chime, before you go farther, and fare worse. To say nothing"
9510,"SIR,","of other advantages, it will at least have one good effect,--and"
9511,"SIR,","that is, to correct the erroneous notion of the would-be poets and"
9512,"SIR,","poetesses of the present day, that the great _end_ of poetry is"
9513,"SIR,","rhyme. I beg leave to present a specimen of worse, which proves"

9573,A FOXHUNTER,A FOXHUNTER
9574,A FOXHUNTER,
9575,A FOXHUNTER,
9576,A FOXHUNTER,Is a jumble of paradoxes. He sets forth clean though he comes out of
9577,A FOXHUNTER,"a kennel, and returns home dirty. He cares not for cards, yet strives"
9578,A FOXHUNTER,"to be always with the pack. He loves fencing, but without carte or"
9579,A FOXHUNTER,"tierce, and delights in a steeplechase, though he does not follow"
9580,A FOXHUNTER,"the Church. He is anything but litigious, yet is fond of a certain"
9581,A FOXHUNTER,"suit, and retains Scarlet. He keeps a running account with Horse,"
9582,A FOXHUNTER,"Dog, Fox, and Co., but objects to a check. As to cards, in choosing a"
9583,A FOXHUNTER,"pack he prefers Hunt’s. In Theatricals, he favours Miss Somerville,"
9584,A FOXHUNTER,"because her namesake wrote the Chase, though he never read it. He is"
9585,A FOXHUNTER,"no great dancer, though he is fond of casting off twenty couple; and"
9586,A FOXHUNTER,"no great Painter, though he draws covers, and seeks for a brush. He"
9587,A FOXHUNTER,"is no Musician, and yet is fond of five bars. He despises Doctors,"
9588,A FOXHUNTER,"yet follows a course of bark. He professes to love his country, but"
9589,A FOXHUNTER,"is perpetually crossing it. He is fond of strong ale and beer, yet"
9590,A FOXHUNTER,"dislikes any purl. He is good-tempered, yet so far a Tartar as to"
9591,A FOXHUNTER,prefer a saddle of Horse to a saddle of Mutton. He is somewhat rough
9592,A FOXHUNTER,"and bearish himself, but insists on good breeding in horses and dogs."
9593,A FOXHUNTER,"He professes the Church Catechism, and countenances heathen dogmas, by"
9594,A FOXHUNTER,"naming his hounds after Jupiter and Juno, Mars and Diana. He cares not"
9595,A FOXHUNTER,"for violets, but he doats on a good scent. He says his wife is a shrew,"
9596,A FOXHUNTER,"but objects to destroying a Vixen. In Politics he inclines to Pitt, and"
9597,A FOXHUNTER,"runs after Fox. He is no milksop, but he loves to Tally. He protects"
9598,A FOXHUNTER,"Poultry, and preserves Foxes. He follows but one business, and yet has"
9599,A FOXHUNTER,"many pursuits. He pretends to be knowing, but a dog leads him by the"
9600,A FOXHUNTER,"nose. He is as honest a fellow as need be, yet his neck is oftener"
9601,A FOXHUNTER,"in danger than a thief’s. He swears he can clear anything, but is"
9602,A FOXHUNTER,"beaten by a fog. He is no landlord of houses, but is particular about"
9603,A FOXHUNTER,"fixtures. He studies “Summering the Hunter,” but goes Huntering in"
9604,A FOXHUNTER,"the Winter. He esteems himself prosperous, and is always going to the"
9605,A FOXHUNTER,"dogs. He delights in the Hunter’s Stakes, but takes care not to stake"
9606,A FOXHUNTER,"his hunter. He praises discretion, but would rather let the cat out of"
9607,A FOXHUNTER,"the bag than a fox. He does not shine at a human conversazione, but is"
9608,A FOXHUNTER,"great among dogs giving tongue. To conclude, he runs as long as he can,"
9609,A FOXHUNTER,"and then goes to earth, and his Heir is in at his death. But his Heir"
9610,A FOXHUNTER,"does not stand in his shoes, for he never wore anything but boots."

9623,BAILEY BALLADS.,
9624,BAILEY BALLADS.,
9625,BAILEY BALLADS.,"To anticipate mistake, the above title refers not to Thomas Haynes--or"
9626,BAILEY BALLADS.,F. W. N.--or even any Publishers--but the original old Bailey. It
9627,BAILEY BALLADS.,belongs to a set of Songs composed during the courtly leisure of what
9628,BAILEY BALLADS.,"is technically called a Juryman in Waiting--that is, one of a _corps"
9629,BAILEY BALLADS.,"de reserve_, held in readiness to fill up the gaps which extraordinary"
9630,BAILEY BALLADS.,"mental exertion--or sedentary habits--or starvation, may make in the"
9631,BAILEY BALLADS.,Council of Twelve. This wrong box it was once my fortune to get into.
9632,BAILEY BALLADS.,"On the 5th of November, at the 6th hour, leaving my bed, and the"
9633,BAILEY BALLADS.,luxurious perusal of Taylor on Early Rising--I walked from a yellow fog
9634,BAILEY BALLADS.,"into a black one, in my unwilling way to the New Court, which sweet"
9635,BAILEY BALLADS.,"herbs even could not sweeten, for the sole purpose of making criminals"
9636,BAILEY BALLADS.,"uncomfortable. A neighbour, a retired sea Captain with a wooden leg,"
9637,BAILEY BALLADS.,"now literally a jury-mast, limped with me from Highbury Terrace on the"
9638,BAILEY BALLADS.,same hanging errand--a personified Halter. Our legal drill Corporal
9639,BAILEY BALLADS.,"was Serjeant Arabin, and when our muster roll without butter was over,"
9640,BAILEY BALLADS.,"before breakfast, the uninitiated can form no idea of the ludicrousness"
9641,BAILEY BALLADS.,"of the excuses of the would-be Nonjurors,--aggravated by the solemnity"
9642,BAILEY BALLADS.,"of a previous oath, the delivery from a witness-box like a pulpit, and"
9643,BAILEY BALLADS.,the professional gravity of the Court. One weakly old gentleman had
9644,BAILEY BALLADS.,"been ordered by his physician to eat little, but often, and apprehended"
9645,BAILEY BALLADS.,even fatal consequences from being locked up with an obstinate eleven;
9646,BAILEY BALLADS.,another conscientious demurrer desired time to make himself master
9647,BAILEY BALLADS.,"of his duties, by consulting Jonathan Wild, Vidocq, Hardy Vaux, and"
9648,BAILEY BALLADS.,Lazarillo de Tormes. But the number of deaf men who objected the
9649,BAILEY BALLADS.,hardness of their hearing criminal cases was beyond belief. The
9650,BAILEY BALLADS.,Publishers of “Curtis on the Ear” and “Wright on the Ear”--(two popular
9651,BAILEY BALLADS.,"surgical works, though rather suggestive of Pugilism)--ought to have"
9652,BAILEY BALLADS.,"stentorian agents in that Court. Defective on one side myself, I was"
9653,BAILEY BALLADS.,literally ashamed to strike up singly in such a chorus of muffled
9654,BAILEY BALLADS.,"double drums, and tacitly suffered my ears to be boxed with a common"
9655,BAILEY BALLADS.,"Jury. I heard, on the right hand, a Judge’s charge--an arraignment"
9656,BAILEY BALLADS.,"and evidence to match, with great dexterity, but failing to catch the"
9657,BAILEY BALLADS.,"defence from the left hand, refused naturally to concur in any sinister"
9658,BAILEY BALLADS.,"verdict. The learned Serjeant, I presume, as I was only half deaf,"
9659,BAILEY BALLADS.,"only half discharged me,--committing me to the relay-box, as a juror"
9660,BAILEY BALLADS.,"in Waiting,--and from which I was relieved only by his successor, Sir"
9661,BAILEY BALLADS.,"Thomas Denman, and to justify my dulness, I made even his stupendous"
9662,BAILEY BALLADS.,voice to repeat my dismissal twice over!
9663,BAILEY BALLADS.,
9664,BAILEY BALLADS.,It was during this compelled attendance that the project struck me
9665,BAILEY BALLADS.,"of a Series of Lays of Larceny, combining Sin and Sentiment in that"
9666,BAILEY BALLADS.,melo-dramatic mixture which is so congenial to the cholera morbid
9667,BAILEY BALLADS.,sensibility of the present age and stage. The following are merely
9668,BAILEY BALLADS.,"specimens, but a hint from the Powers that be--in the Strand,--will"
9669,BAILEY BALLADS.,"promptly produce a handsome volume of the remainder, with a grateful"

10030,OUR VILLAGE.,"landlord over the way says, that “things are drawn _mild_.”"
10031,OUR VILLAGE.,
10032,OUR VILLAGE.,"I live opposite the Green Man. I know that to be the sign, in spite of"
10033,OUR VILLAGE.,"the picture, because I am told of the fact in large gilt letters, in"
10034,OUR VILLAGE.,three several places. The whole-length portrait of “_l’homme verd_” is
10035,OUR VILLAGE.,"rather imposing. He stands plump before you, in a sort of wrestling"
10036,OUR VILLAGE.,"attitude, the legs standing distinctly apart, in a brace of decided"
10037,OUR VILLAGE.,"boots, with dun tops, joined to a pair of creole-coloured leather"
10038,OUR VILLAGE.,"breeches. The rest of his dress is peculiar; the coat, a two-flapper,"
10039,OUR VILLAGE.,"green and brown, or, as they say at the tap, _half-and-half_; a cocked"
10040,OUR VILLAGE.,hat on the half cock; a short belt crossing the breast like a flat
10041,OUR VILLAGE.,"gas-pipe. The one hand stuck on the greeny-brown hip of my friend, in"
10042,OUR VILLAGE.,"the other a gun with a barrel like an entire butt, and a butt like a"
10043,OUR VILLAGE.,"brewer’s whole stock. On one side, looking up at the vanished visage of"
10044,OUR VILLAGE.,"his master, is all that remains of a liver-and-white pointer--seeming"
10045,OUR VILLAGE.,"now to be some old dog from India, for his white complexion is turned"
10046,OUR VILLAGE.,"yellow, and his liver is more than half gone!"
10047,OUR VILLAGE.,
10048,OUR VILLAGE.,"The inn is really a very quiet, cozy, comfortable inn, though the"

10057,OUR VILLAGE.,
10058,OUR VILLAGE.,"I had written thus far, when the tarnished gold letters of the Green"
10059,OUR VILLAGE.,"Man seemed to be suddenly re-gilt; and on looking upwards, I perceived"
10060,OUR VILLAGE.,"that a sort of sky-light had been opened in the clouds, giving entrance"
10061,OUR VILLAGE.,"to a bright gleam of sunshine, which glowed with remarkable effect on"
10062,OUR VILLAGE.,"a yellow post-chaise in the stable-yard, and brought the ducks out"
10063,OUR VILLAGE.,beautifully white from the black horse-pond. Tempted by the appearance
10064,OUR VILLAGE.,"of the weather, I put down my pen and strolled out for a quarter of"
10065,OUR VILLAGE.,"an hour before dinner to inhale that air, without which, like the"
10066,OUR VILLAGE.,"chameleon I cannot feed. On my return, I found, with some surprise,"
10067,OUR VILLAGE.,"that my papers were a good deal discomposed; but, before I had time"
10068,OUR VILLAGE.,"for much wonder, my landlady entered with one of her most obliging"
10069,OUR VILLAGE.,"courtesies, and observed that she had seen me writing in the morning,"
10070,OUR VILLAGE.,"and it had occurred to her by chance, that I might by possibility"
10071,OUR VILLAGE.,have been writing a description of the village. I told her that I had
10072,OUR VILLAGE.,"actually been engaged on that very subject. “If that is the case, of"
10073,OUR VILLAGE.,"course, Sir, you would begin, no doubt, about the Green Man, being"
10074,OUR VILLAGE.,"so close by; and I dare say, you would say something about the sign,"
10075,OUR VILLAGE.,"and the Green Man with his top boots, and his gun, and his Indian"
10076,OUR VILLAGE.,"liver-and-white pointer, though his white to be sure is turned yellow,"
10077,OUR VILLAGE.,"and his liver is more than half gone.” “You are perfectly right, Mrs."
10078,OUR VILLAGE.,"Ledger,” I replied, “and in one part of the description, I think I"
10079,OUR VILLAGE.,"have used almost your own very words.” “Well, that _is_ curious, Sir,”"
10080,OUR VILLAGE.,"exclaimed Mrs. L., and physically, not arithmetically, casting up"
10081,OUR VILLAGE.,"all her hands and eyes. “Moreover, what I mean to say, is this; and"
10082,OUR VILLAGE.,I only say that to save trouble. There’s a young man lodges at the
10083,OUR VILLAGE.,"Green Grocer’s over the way, who has writ an account of the village"
10084,OUR VILLAGE.,"already to your hand. The people about the place call him the Poet,"
10085,OUR VILLAGE.,"but, anyhow, he studies a good deal, and writes beautiful; and, as I"
10086,OUR VILLAGE.,"said before, has made the whole village out of his own head. Now, it"
10087,OUR VILLAGE.,"might save trouble, Sir, if you was to write it out, and I am sure I"
10088,OUR VILLAGE.,"have a copy, that, as far as the loan goes, is at your service, Sir.”"
10089,OUR VILLAGE.,My curiosity induced me to take the offer; and as the poem really
10090,OUR VILLAGE.,"forestalled what I had to say of the Hamlet, I took my landlady’s"

10406,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,
10407,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,
10408,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"To mention only by name the sorrows of an Undertaker, will be likely to"
10409,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"raise a smile on most faces,--the mere words suggest a solemn stalking"
10410,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,parody of grief to the satiric fancy;--but give a fair hearing to my
10411,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"woes, and even the veriest mocker may learn to pity an Undertaker who"
10412,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,has been unfortunate in all his undertakings.
10413,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,
10414,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"My Father, a Furnisher and Performer in the funeral line, used to say"
10415,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"of me,--noticing some boyish levities--that “I should never do for an"
10416,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"Undertaker.” But the prediction was wrong--my Parent died, and I did"
10417,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"for him in the way of business. Having no other alternative, I took"
10418,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,possession of a very fair stock and business. I felt at first as if
10419,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"plunged in the Black Sea--and when I read my name upon the shop door,"
10420,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"it threw a crape over my spirits, that I did not get rid of for some"
10421,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,months.
10422,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,
10423,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,Then came the cares of business. The scandalous insinuated that the
10424,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,funerals were not so decorously performed as in the time of the Late. I
10425,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"discharged my mutes, who were grown fat and jocular, and sought about"
10426,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,for the lean and lank visaged kind. But these demure rogues cheated and
10427,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"robbed me--plucked my feathers and pruned my scarfs, and I was driven"
10428,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"back again to my “merrie men,”--whose only fault was making a pleasure"
10429,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,of their business.
10430,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,
10431,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,[Illustration: FAIRY LAND.]
10432,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,
10433,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"Soon after this, I made myself prominent in the parish, and obtained"
10434,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,a contract for Parochial Conchology--or shells for the paupers. But
10435,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"this even, as I may say, broke down on its first tressels. Having as my"
10436,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,first job to inter a workhouse female--Ætat. 96--and wishing to gain
10437,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"the good opinion of the parish, I had made the arrangements with more"
10438,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,than usual decency. The company were at the door. Placing myself at
10439,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"the head, with my best burial face, and my slowest solemnity of step,"
10440,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"I set forward, and thanks to my professional deafness,--induced by"
10441,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"the constant hammering--I never perceived, till at the church gates,"
10442,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,that the procession had not stirred from the door of the house. So
10443,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"good a joke was not lost upon my two Mutes, who made it an excuse for"
10444,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,chuckling on after occasions. But to me the consequence was serious.
10445,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,A notion arose amongst the poor that I was too proud to walk along
10446,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"with their remains, and the ferment ran so high, that I was finally"
10447,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,compelled to give up my contract.
10448,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,
10449,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,So much for foot funerals. Now for coach work. The extravagant charges
10450,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,of the jobbers at last induced me to set up a Hearse and Mourning
10451,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"Coaches of my own, with sleek ebony long-tailed horses to match. One"
10452,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,of these--the finest of the set--had been sold to me under warranty of
10453,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"being sound and free from vice; and so he was, but the dealer never"
10454,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,told me that he had been a charger at Astley’s. Accordingly on his
10455,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"very first performance, in passing through Bow,--at that time a kind"
10456,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"of Fairy Land,--he thought proper, on hearing a showman’s trumpet, to"
10457,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,dance a cotillion in his feathers! There was nothing to be done but to
10458,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"travel on with three to the next stage, where I sold the caperer at a"
10459,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"heavy loss, and to the infinite regret of my merry mourners, with whom"
10460,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,this exhibition had made him a great favourite. From this period my
10461,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"business rapidly declined, till instead of five or six demises, on an"
10462,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"average, I put in only two defuncts and a half per week."
10463,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,
10464,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,In this extremity a “black job” was brought to me that promised to make
10465,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,amends for the rest. One fine morning a brace of executors walked into
10466,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"the shop, and handing to me the following extract of a will, politely"
10467,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,requested that I would perform accordingly--and with the pleasing
10468,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,addition that I was to be regardless of the expense. The document ran
10469,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"thus: “Item, I will and desire that after death, my body be placed in"
10470,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"a strong leaden coffin, the same to be afterwards enclosed in one of"
10471,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"oak, and therein my remains to be conveyed handsomely to the village"
10472,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"of *** in Norfolk, my birth-place; there to lie, being duly watched,"
10473,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"during one night, in the Family mansion now unoccupied, and on the"
10474,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"morrow to be carried thence to the church, the coffin being borne by"
10475,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"the six oldest resident and decayed parishioners, male or female, and"
10476,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"for the same they shall receive severally the sum of five pounds, to be"
10477,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,paid on or before the day of interment.”
10478,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,
10479,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,It will be believed that I lost no time in preparing the last solid
10480,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,and costly receptacles for the late Lady Lambert; and the unusual
10481,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,bulk of the deceased seemed in prospective to justify a bill of
10482,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"proportionate magnitude. I was prodigal of plumes and scutcheons, of"
10483,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"staves and scarfs, and mourning coaches; and finally, raising a whole"
10484,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"company of black cavalry, we set out by stages, short and sweet, for"
10485,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,our destination. I had been prudent enough to send a letter before me
10486,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"to prepare the bearers, and imprudent enough to remit their fees in"
10487,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"advance. But I had no misgivings. My men enjoyed the excursion, and so"
10488,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"did I. We ate well, drank well, slept well, and expected to be well"
10489,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,paid for what was so well done. At the last stage it happened I had
10490,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"rather an intricate reckoning to arrange, by which means being detained"
10491,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"a full hour behind the cavalcade, I did not reach the desired village"
10492,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,till the whole party had established themselves at the Dying Dolphin;
10493,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,a fact I first ascertained from hearing the merriment of my two mutes
10494,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"in the parlour. Highly indignant at this breach of decorum, I rushed"
10495,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,in on the offending couple; and let the Undertaking Reader conceive my
10496,THE SORROWS OF AN UNDERTAKER.,"feelings, when the following letter was put into my hands, explaining"

10977,(BY HIMSELF).,
10978,(BY HIMSELF).,
10979,(BY HIMSELF).,"I was born, I may almost say, an orphan; my Father died three months"
10980,(BY HIMSELF).,"before I saw the light, and my Mother three hours after--thus I was"
10981,(BY HIMSELF).,"left in the whole world alone, and an only child, for I had neither"
10982,(BY HIMSELF).,Brothers nor Sisters; much of my after passion for solitude might be
10983,(BY HIMSELF).,"ascribed to this cause, for I believe our tendencies date themselves"
10984,(BY HIMSELF).,"from a much earlier age, or rather, youth, than is generally imagined."
10985,(BY HIMSELF).,"It was remarked that I could go alone at nine months, and I have had"
10986,(BY HIMSELF).,an aptitude to going alone all the rest of my life. The first words
10987,(BY HIMSELF).,"I learnt to say, were “I by myself, I”--or thou--or he--or she--or"
10988,(BY HIMSELF).,it--but I was a long time before I could pronounce any personals in the
10989,(BY HIMSELF).,plural; my little games and habits were equally singular. I was fond of
10990,(BY HIMSELF).,"playing at Solitary or at Patience, or another game of cards of my own"
10991,(BY HIMSELF).,"invention, namely, whist, with _three_ dummies. Of books, my favourite"
10992,(BY HIMSELF).,"was Robinson Crusoe, especially the first part, for I was not fond of"
10993,(BY HIMSELF).,"the intrusion of Friday, and thought the natives really were Savages"
10994,(BY HIMSELF).,to spoil such a solitude. At ten years of age I was happily placed
10995,(BY HIMSELF).,"with the Rev. Mr. Steinkopff, a widower, who took in only the limited"
10996,(BY HIMSELF).,"number of six pupils, and had only me to begin with; here I enjoyed"
10997,(BY HIMSELF).,"myself very much, learning in a first and last class in school hours,"
10998,(BY HIMSELF).,"and playing in play time at hoop, and other pretty games not requiring"
10999,(BY HIMSELF).,"partners. My playground was, in short, a garden of Eden, and I did not"
11000,(BY HIMSELF).,"even sigh for an Eve, but, like Paradise, it was too happy to last."
11001,(BY HIMSELF).,"I was removed from Mr. Steinkopff’s to the University of Göttingen,"
11002,(BY HIMSELF).,"and at once the eyes of six hundred pupils, and the pupils of twelve"
11003,(BY HIMSELF).,"hundred eyes, seemed fastened upon me: I felt like an owl forced into"
11004,(BY HIMSELF).,"day-light; often and often I shammed ill, as an excuse for confining"
11005,(BY HIMSELF).,"myself to my chamber, but some officious would-be friends, insisting"
11006,(BY HIMSELF).,"on coming to sit with me, as they said, to enliven my solitude, I"
11007,(BY HIMSELF).,"was forced as a last resource to do that which subjected me, on the"
11008,(BY HIMSELF).,"principle of Howard’s Prison Discipline, to solitary confinement."
11009,(BY HIMSELF).,But even this pleasure did not last; the heads of the College found
11010,(BY HIMSELF).,"out that solitary confinement was no punishment, and put another"
11011,(BY HIMSELF).,student in the same cell; in this extremity I had no alternative but
11012,(BY HIMSELF).,"to endeavour to make him a convert to my principles, and in some days"
11013,(BY HIMSELF).,"I succeeded in convincing him of the individual independence of man,"
11014,(BY HIMSELF).,"the solid pleasures of solitude, and the hollow one of society,--in"
11015,(BY HIMSELF).,"short, he so warmly adopted my views, that in a transport of sympathy"
11016,(BY HIMSELF).,"we swore an eternal friendship, and agreed to separate for ever,"
11017,(BY HIMSELF).,and keep ourselves to ourselves as much as possible. To this end we
11018,(BY HIMSELF).,"formed with our blanket a screen across our cell, and that we might"
11019,(BY HIMSELF).,"not even in thought associate with each other, he soliloquised only"
11020,(BY HIMSELF).,"in French, of which I was ignorant, and I in English, to which he was"
11021,(BY HIMSELF).,"equally a stranger. Under this system my wishes were gratified, for"
11022,(BY HIMSELF).,I think I felt more intensely lonely than I ever remember when more
11023,(BY HIMSELF).,strictly alone. Of course this condition had a conclusion; we were
11024,(BY HIMSELF).,"brought out again unwillingly into the common world, and the firm"
11025,(BY HIMSELF).,"of Zimmermann, Nobody, and Co., was compelled to admit--six hundred"
11026,(BY HIMSELF).,"partners. In this extremity, my fellow prisoner Zingleman and myself"
11027,(BY HIMSELF).,"had recourse to the persuasions of oratory. We preached solitude, and"
11028,(BY HIMSELF).,"got quite a congregation, and of the six hundred hearers, four hundred"
11029,(BY HIMSELF).,at least became converts to our Unitarian Doctrine; every one of these
11030,(BY HIMSELF).,"disciples strove to fly to the most obscure recesses, and the little"
11031,(BY HIMSELF).,cemetery of the College had always a plenty of those who were trying
11032,(BY HIMSELF).,to make themselves scarce. This of course was afflicting; as in the
11033,(BY HIMSELF).,"game of puss in a corner, it was difficult to get a corner unoccupied"
11034,(BY HIMSELF).,to be alone in; the defections and desertions from the College were
11035,(BY HIMSELF).,"consequently numerous, and for a long time the state gazette contained"
11036,(BY HIMSELF).,"daily advertisements for missing gentlemen, with a description of their"
11037,(BY HIMSELF).,"persons and habits, and invariably concluding with this sentence: “of a"
11038,(BY HIMSELF).,"melancholy turn,--calls himself a Zimmermanian, and affects solitude.”"
11039,(BY HIMSELF).,"In fact, as Schiller’s Robbers begot Robbers, so did my solitude"
11040,(BY HIMSELF).,"beget solitudinarians, but with this difference, that the dramatist’s"
11041,(BY HIMSELF).,"disciples frequented the Highways, and mine the Byeways!"
11042,(BY HIMSELF).,
11043,(BY HIMSELF).,"The consequence was what might have been expected, which I had"
11044,(BY HIMSELF).,"foreseen, and ardently desired. I was expelled from the University of"
11045,(BY HIMSELF).,Göttingen. This was perhaps the triumph of my life. A grand dinner was
11046,(BY HIMSELF).,"got up by Zingleman in my honour, at which more than three hundred"
11047,(BY HIMSELF).,"were present, but in tacit homage to my principles, they never spoke"
11048,(BY HIMSELF).,"nor held any communication with each other, and at a concerted signal"
11049,(BY HIMSELF).,"the toast of “Zimmermann and Solitude” was drunk, by dumb show, in"
11050,(BY HIMSELF).,"appropriate solemn silence. I was much affected by this tribute, and"
11051,(BY HIMSELF).,"left with tears in my eyes, to think, with such sentiments, how many of"
11052,(BY HIMSELF).,"us might be thrown together again. Being thus left to myself, like a"
11053,(BY HIMSELF).,"vessel with only one hand on board, I was at liberty to steer my own"
11054,(BY HIMSELF).,"course, and accordingly took a lodging at Number One, in Wilderness"
11055,(BY HIMSELF).,"Street, that held out the inviting prospect of a single room to let for"
11056,(BY HIMSELF).,a single man. In this congenial situation I composed that my great work
11057,(BY HIMSELF).,"on Solitude, and here I think it necessary to warn the reader against"
11058,(BY HIMSELF).,"many spurious books, calling themselves “Companions to Zimmermann’s"
11059,(BY HIMSELF).,"Solitude,” as if solitude could have society. Alas, from this work I"
11060,(BY HIMSELF).,may date the decline which my presentiment tells me will terminate
11061,(BY HIMSELF).,"in my death. My book, though written against populousness, became so"
11062,(BY HIMSELF).,"popular, that its author, though in love with loneliness, could never"
11063,(BY HIMSELF).,"be alone. Striving to fly from the face of man, I could never escape"
11064,(BY HIMSELF).,"it, nor that of woman and child into the bargain. When I stirred"
11065,(BY HIMSELF).,"abroad mobs surrounded me, and cried, “Here is the Solitary!”--when"
11066,(BY HIMSELF).,I staid at home I was equally crowded; all the public societies of
11067,(BY HIMSELF).,"Göttingen thought proper to come up to me with addresses, and not even"
11068,(BY HIMSELF).,"by deputation. Flight was my only resource, but it did not avail, for"
11069,(BY HIMSELF).,I could not fly from myself. Wherever I went Zimmermann and Solitude
11070,(BY HIMSELF).,"had got before me, and their votaries assembled to meet me. In vain"
11071,(BY HIMSELF).,I travelled throughout the European and Asiatic continent: with an
11072,(BY HIMSELF).,"enthusiasm and perseverance of which only Germans are capable, some of"
11073,(BY HIMSELF).,"my countrymen were sure to haunt me, and really showed by the distance"
11074,(BY HIMSELF).,"they journeyed, that they were ready to go all lengths with me and my"
11075,(BY HIMSELF).,doctrine. Some of these Pilgrims even brought their wives and children
11076,(BY HIMSELF).,"along with them, in search of my solitude; and were so unreasonable"
11077,(BY HIMSELF).,"even as to murmur at my taking the inside of a coach, or the cabin of a"
11078,(BY HIMSELF).,packet-boat to myself.
11079,(BY HIMSELF).,
11080,(BY HIMSELF).,From these persecutions I was released by what some persons would call
11081,(BY HIMSELF).,"an unfortunate accident, a vessel in which I sailed from Leghorn, going"
11082,(BY HIMSELF).,"down at sea with all hands excepting my own pair, which happened to"
11083,(BY HIMSELF).,"have grappled a hen-coop. There was no sail in sight, nor any land to"
11084,(BY HIMSELF).,be seen--nothing but sea and sky; and from the midst of the watery
11085,(BY HIMSELF).,expanse it was perhaps the first and only glimpse I ever had of real
11086,(BY HIMSELF).,"and perfect solitude, yet so inconsistent is human nature, I could"
11087,(BY HIMSELF).,not really and perfectly enter into its enjoyment. I was picked up
11088,(BY HIMSELF).,"at length by a British brig of war, and, schooled by the past, had"
11089,(BY HIMSELF).,"the presence of mind to conceal my name, and to adopt the English one"
11090,(BY HIMSELF).,"of Grundy. Under this _nom de guerre_, but really a name of peace,"
11091,(BY HIMSELF).,"I enjoyed comparative quiet, interrupted only by the pertinacious"
11092,(BY HIMSELF).,"attendance of an unconscious countryman, who, noticing my very retired"
11093,(BY HIMSELF).,"habits, endeavoured by daily lectures from my own work, to make me"
11094,(BY HIMSELF).,"a convert to my own principles. In short, he so wore me out, that"
11095,(BY HIMSELF).,"at last, to get rid of his importunities, I told him in confidence"
11096,(BY HIMSELF).,that I was the author himself. But the result was anything but what I
11097,(BY HIMSELF).,expected; and here I must blush again for the inconsistency of human
11098,(BY HIMSELF).,"nature. While Winkells knew me only as Grundy, he painted nothing but"
11099,(BY HIMSELF).,"the charms of Solitude, and exhorted me to detach myself from society;"
11100,(BY HIMSELF).,"but no sooner did he learn that I was Zimmermann, than he insisted on"
11101,(BY HIMSELF).,"my going to Lady C----’s rout and his own conversazione. In fact,"
11102,(BY HIMSELF).,"he wanted to make me, instead of a Lion of the Desert, a Lion of the"
11103,(BY HIMSELF).,"Menagerie. How I resented such a proposition may be supposed, as"
11104,(BY HIMSELF).,well as his offer to procure for me the first vacancy that happened
11105,(BY HIMSELF).,"in the situation of Hermit at Lord P----’s Hermitage; being, as he"
11106,(BY HIMSELF).,"was pleased to say, not only able to bear solitude, but well-bred"
11107,(BY HIMSELF).,"and well-informed, and fit to _receive company_. The effect of this"
11108,(BY HIMSELF).,"unfortunate disclosure was to make me leave England, for fear of"
11109,(BY HIMSELF).,meeting with the fate of a man or an ox that ventures to quit the
11110,(BY HIMSELF).,"common herd. I should immediately have been declared mad, and mobbed"
11111,(BY HIMSELF).,"into lunacy, and then put into solitary confinement, with a keeper"
11112,(BY HIMSELF).,"always with me, as a person beside himself, and not fit to be left"
11113,(BY HIMSELF).,alone for a moment. As such a fate would have been worse to me than
11114,(BY HIMSELF).,"death, I immediately left London, and am now living anonymously in an"

11174,BEING AN APOLOGY FOR NOT MAKING AN ATTEMPT ON MY OWN LIFE.,"insists, therefore, that I am of a pensive habit, and “have never"

11561,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"SYL.--Aye, truly; I did once spend, or rather misspend a whole"

11628,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"but a new species. I caught one in the fact, on the very elm tree you"

11636,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"through the body, and fixed it down to a cork after the manner of the"
11637,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,entomologists.
11638,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,
11639,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"SYL.--No, truly; for it knocked me down after the manner of"

11641,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,
11642,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"CIV.--How! be they so huge, then? To my fancy, they seem more"

11644,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,
11645,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"SYL.--It is true, notwithstanding. Some of them which I have"
11646,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"seen, measured nearly six feet in length; others, that were younger,"
11647,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"from three to five. One of these last, the Minimi, or small fry, I"

11654,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,
11655,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"SYL.--No, indeed. I had not the heart; the visage was so"
11656,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"strangely human, ape or monkey could not look more like a man in the"

11669,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"Two fore-legs or arms terminating in ten palpi or feelers, and the same"

11679,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,
11680,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"SYL.--Between ourselves, he was--though of what nation or"

11689,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,
11690,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,SYL.--To make sham Hyson and mock Souchong. Even in June you
11691,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"would have deemed it was November, there were so many ragged Guys"
11692,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"collecting gunpowder. Oh, Civis, thou hast no notion of the tea-trade"
11693,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,that hath been carried on in these parts. Many times I have believed
11694,SUMMER--A WINTER ECLOGUE.,"myself to be dwelling in Canton, and that my name was Hum. Thrice I"

12084,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","blackamoor, with the very eyes of his head giving notice to quit."
12085,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","What matter that Tony had a bramble in his mind, that bore reasons"
12086,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","like blackberries, and ripe ones too; as for example, that a tight"
12087,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","rope round the gullet is very bad for the health, and particularly"
12088,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","when one’s health requires to take pills, or even boluses, three"
12089,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","times a day? I say, he might have given a thousand such reasonable"
12090,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","reasons against hanging, but the very momentous minute of opening his"
12091,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","mouth, the Chief Pitcher pitched into it a prodigious great bung,"
12092,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",as dab and apt and cleverly as if he had played at nothing else but
12093,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",chuck-farthing and pitch-in-the-hole ever since he was fourteen. So
12094,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the mummy of silence being preserved, the Merlinising began, and hey"
12095,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","presto! before you could say Herman Boaz, the big wig was turned into"
12096,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",a black cap! After that you may tell the world that our Judges are no
12097,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","conjurors. Thus the trial ended, and Tony’s sentence, as taken in the"
12098,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","hieroglyphical short-hand, ran thus: namely, “that he was to be sent on"
12099,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",a Black Monday to the Deaf and Dumb School that is kept in a coffin.”
12100,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",
12101,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","All this time, mark you, he had the whim with him in the dock, and"
12102,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","to look at it now and then seemed his only comfort in life,--how it"
12103,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","whisked and frisked, and looked about it, and fed heartily, as if there"
12104,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",had been no such thing as law or law-cats in the blessed world; and
12105,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","when Tony went back, like a volume of felony, to be bound in stone,"
12106,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the whim still went with him to his cell, and from his cell to the"
12107,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","press-room, and from the press-room to the debtor’s door, and from the"
12108,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","debtor’s door to death’s door itself, which opens on the scaffold, as"
12109,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","you turn off to the right hand or the left, in your way to nobody knows"
12110,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","where. To take such a whim of a reptile with one to the gallows, seems"
12111,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","whimsical enough; but the Emperor Adrian, if you read the classics,"
12112,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","had such a vagabondish, blandish, little animal, his animula vagula"
12113,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","blandula, to be with him on his death-bed."
12114,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",
12115,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Well, Friday came, and Saturday, and Sunday, and Sunday’s night; he was"
12116,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",posting to eternity with four bolters. I will bet the whole national
12117,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","debt he would have given eighteen-pence a mile, and half-a-crown to the"
12118,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","boy, to have been posting on any other road. All the favour the law"
12119,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",allowed him was to have an Ordinary at eight instead of an ordinary at
12120,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","one, a very ordinary favour to a man who was about to leave off dining."
12121,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","But the devil ought to have his due, and so should the Lord Mayor and"
12122,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the Sheriffs. As they had neglected Tony a little, by not being with"
12123,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the other gossips at his christening, to usher him into this world,"
12124,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","they attended very ceremoniously to show him out of it, each in his"
12125,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","gilt coach; and, with regard to the coachmen, the footmen, and even"
12126,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the very horses themselves, they were all Malthusians. Of course the"
12127,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Recorder brought the hanging-warrant, and if you would know what the"
12128,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","hanging-warrant was like, it was like a map of _Cheshire_ with the"
12129,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",_Mersey_ left out.
12130,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",
12131,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","I forgot to tell you, that before it came to this pass, the Ordinary"
12132,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","came oftentimes to the cell where Tony was, to pray, besides whom there"
12133,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","was an Extraordinary, who examined him on his points of faith. And the"
12134,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","points of faith were these; namely, whether he believed the moon to be"
12135,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","of green cheese, and as to the size of the mites thereon. Secondly, if"
12136,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",he believed the puppet-play of Punch and Judy to be a type of the fall
12137,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","of Nineveh; and, thirdly, concerning the lions in Pilgrim’s Progress,"
12138,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","whether they were bred at Mr. Wombwell’s or Mr. Cross’s, or at the"
12139,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Tower of London. To all of which Tony giving decidedly serious answers,"
12140,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","he was pronounced fit to die, and quite prepared to have his neck"
12141,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","stretched, as long as the throttle of a claret-bottle when the wine is"
12142,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",ropy.
12143,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",
12144,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Accordingly, on the morning of Monday, Time laid his long hand upon"
12145,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Tony’s collar, and gave him eight distinct hints that his hour was"
12146,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","come for being ornithologised by sentence of the great Law Bird, genus"
12147,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Black-cap, into jail bird, genus Wryneck. Never was there such mobbing"
12148,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",to see a hanging. Half the Londoners that morning went without their
12149,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","breakfasts to be in time for the Old Bailey. Trot, trot, trot, canter"
12150,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","and full gallop; away through Piccadilly; push on there, in the Strand,"
12151,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","hey down Holborn Hill, with a yoicks in Cheapside, and a hark forward"
12152,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","in Newgate Street, and a tally ho! in West Smithfield. They all meant"
12153,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","to be in at the death. Never was there such a race, to see a man whose"
12154,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",race was run losing it by a neck. And the order of the running was
12155,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","thus:--The Royal Humane Society got in first at the Drop, and had an"
12156,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",excellent front row. The Society for Preventing Cruelty to Animals
12157,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","was a good second; and may I die, if the Law Life Assurance hadn’t"
12158,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the assurance to come third. Next came the Philanthropic Society,"
12159,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",with the Society of Good Samaritans barely a length behind; and then
12160,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, neck and neck with the"
12161,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","London Benevolent Society; all racing till they panted again, to see"
12162,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",Tony put out of breath. You never saw such a chevy! Luckily there was
12163,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","no Anniversary at St. Paul’s, so the Sons of the Clergy cantered in"
12164,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","with all the children of all the parishes that had any charity, to see"
12165,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",an execution put in for the debt of Nature. Also the Medical Society
12166,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",came to see one die by the New Dropsy; and all the Knights of the
12167,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Garter, with their orders, _it being a collar-day_, wherefore they wore"
12168,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",their garters according to the fashion of Miss Bailey; and all the
12169,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Foreign Ambassadors. Seeing which, Tony put on a good face, and walked"
12170,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","stoutly up the ladder, saying softly to himself, “the eyes of Europe"
12171,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","are upon you.” All being ready, with the Ordinary on the right hand,"
12172,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","and the Extraordinary on the left, and the Great Constrictor a little"
12173,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","behind, Tony (who had his whim with him) was asked how he felt himself,"
12174,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","and how his father and mother did, and all his little brothers and"
12175,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","sisters; to which he answered thankfully, that they were all very well,"
12176,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","and that for his own part, he felt very comfortable, and died in the"
12177,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",faith of St. Vitus. Now the faith of St. Vitus is not exactly the faith
12178,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","of the Church of England, nor, in faith, do I well know what faith"
12179,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","it is; but the Ordinary took no objection to it, for he was a man in"
12180,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","favour of universal toleration, remembering the saying of the heathen"
12181,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Priest of Apollo to the Bishop of Magnum Bonum, “You have _your_"
12182,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","thology, and let me have _my_thology.” So the Ordinary held his peace,"
12183,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",but the Extraordinary would fain have argued the point regularly and
12184,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","methodically, according to the dogmatical manner of Cerberus, namely,"
12185,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",in a discourse with three heads; and if he had once begun to spin the
12186,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","triple yarn of controversy, prosyversy, and viceversy into a cable,"
12187,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",there is no saying on oath whether the other rope might have been used
12188,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","to this day. Seeing, therefore, how matters stood, Master Strangulator"
12189,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","pushed in, with an elbowing manner, and began begging pardon of Tony"
12190,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","for the part he was about to perform, who forgave him very readily,"
12191,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","requesting him moreover to shake hands, and by Gog and Magog, such a"
12192,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",shake was never shaked since the Shakers became a sect!
12193,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",
12194,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","At the first grapple of their fingers, the Strangulator pulled away his"
12195,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","hand with a jerk, as if a bear’s palm had been palmed upon him instead"
12196,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","of a human paw. Then, after making a frightful face, he gave a mighty"
12197,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","great spring or vault upwards, a deal higher than the gallows, when,"
12198,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","on coming down, he alighted with his legs a-straddle upon the beam,"
12199,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",where he kept posturing for some five minutes; now rowing with his
12200,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","arms and legs, like a fish, now hanging with his head downwards, first"
12201,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","by one leg and then by the other, then by one hand, and then again"
12202,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","by his chin; you never saw a rope-dancer or tumbler of them all, at"
12203,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Bartlemy’s or Astley’s, more nimble. Then coming down to the stage with"
12204,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","a bound, he threw three summersets forward, and then three backwards,"
12205,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","as quick as thought. Anon, after standing for a minute in the first"
12206,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","position, he fell a-dancing with all his might and main, and as fast"
12207,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","as he could lift his feet, like a bear upon a hotted floor. Never was"
12208,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",such a spring danced round about the gallows-tree; Gilderoy was a fool
12209,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","to him. You may guess how the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, and the Ordinary"
12210,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","and Extraordinary, stared at such a caper, till their eyes grew as big"
12211,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","as owls’; and still more when they saw Tony, after making a round O"
12212,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","of his mouth, fall to bouncing and bounding like another Oscar Byrne!"
12213,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Shade of Holbein, what a Dance of Death! Only think of Jack Ketch and"
12214,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the condemned dancing face to face on the drop, now poussetting, now"
12215,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","setting to each other, now allemanding, now waltzing, and then, Father"
12216,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","of Vestris, what a tableau! Tony figuring, opera-fashion, on one leg,"
12217,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",with Cheshire poising on tip-toe on the calf of the other! As for his
12218,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","whim, it was jerked out of the box at the first frisk, and had enough"
12219,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","to do, you may be sure, to scuttle out of the way of the skipping and"
12220,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","hopping; as it was, the poor reptile got more kicks than ha’pence."
12221,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",
12222,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","In the meantime the Humanes, and the Samaritans, and the"
12223,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Benevolents, and the rest of the mob, did not stand and look on"
12224,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","quite as mum as if it had been an overbrimming Quaker’s meeting,"
12225,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",with a collection afterwards at the door for the Deaf and Dumb.
12226,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","They chuckled, and crowed, and laughed till they brayed again;"
12227,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","and roared, and bellowed, and shouted, and shrieked like hyænas"
12228,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","in hysterics. “Huzza! huzzaw! Go it, Jack! That’s your sort"
12229,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","encore--ancore--anker--ancoore,--bravo--brawvo--bravoo--brawvoo!"
12230,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",Well done Tony--Tony for ever--Tony for my money!--keep it up! It’s
12231,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","better than dancing upon nothing.” If Laporte had been there, who"
12232,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",knows what offer he might have made them; for Taglioni herself never
12233,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","danced so--that is to say, gratis, and without music. On they jigged,"
12234,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","however, without let or stint, and may I hang my hat up for ever, if"
12235,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the same whim did not suddenly take the marshal, janitor, or head"
12236,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","gaoler, however unfit for dancing, seeing that one of his legs was"
12237,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","made of the same flesh as my oak table. Timber or not, he balanced on"
12238,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","it for a whole minute, while the other foot’s great toe, far above his"
12239,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","hip, pointed exactly at the clock of St. Sepulchre, and then swinging"
12240,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","his arms like a horizontal windmill, he spun off into a whirlwind of"
12241,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","pirouettes that made one giddy to look at. That done, he struck in"
12242,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","between the other two with a real step, and they immediately began to"
12243,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","work out a dancing sum in the rule of three, which requires only one"
12244,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","figure, namely, a figure of eight. Scuffle, shuffle, in and out, the"
12245,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","three Kirk Alloway witches could not have footed it better. In fact,"
12246,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","there was no resisting it. The whim took the very Ordinary himself,"
12247,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","though less boisterously at first, by reason of the gravity of his"
12248,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","calling, wherefore, taking a graceful grip with either hand of his"
12249,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","cassock, he only glided off, to begin with, into the minuet de la"
12250,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","cour. However, as the dancing grew more fast and furious, he gradually"
12251,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","danced, in spite of himself, having been classically bred, into the"
12252,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","College Hornpipe, and I defy anyone to say they ever saw it better"
12253,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","danced, or more briskly, by the very Doctors of Oxford and Cambridge."
12254,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Mother of Almack’s, what a quadrille! What a ball! The three Fates,"
12255,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","though winders of thread, and spinsters in ordinary, had never seen"
12256,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","such a Cotton ball! It was the strangest capriccio, the rarest mad"
12257,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","morrice that ever was danced; one minute a mazurka, then a polonaise,"
12258,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","then a gallopade, then a fandango, then a bolero, then a saraband,"
12259,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","then a guaracha, then a Highland fling! Sometimes the Strangulator, by"
12260,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","help of the halter which he waved this way and that, seemed executing"
12261,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the shawl dance; anon, he doubled shuffled like Dusty Bob. One minute"
12262,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",Tony appeared as measuring his steps with a duchess dowager of the time
12263,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",of Louis the Fourteenth; the next he was snapping his fingers with
12264,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","Maggie Lauder to the tune of Tullochgorum. You fancied one minute, that"
12265,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the Ordinary was dancing a pas seul, to the music of Haydn’s slow"

12267,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","he started off into as grotesque a burlesque as ever was flung, and"
12268,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","floundered, and flounced, and bounced, and shuffled, and scuffled,"
12269,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","and draggled, and wiggle-waggled, shambled, gambolled, scrambled, and"
12270,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","skimble-skambled by Grimaldi, in Mother Goose. Blessed were they who"
12271,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","were born to behold it, though but from the mother’s arms. It was"
12272,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","worth going five miles to see, the first mile trundling a coach-wheel,"
12273,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","the second picking up eggs, the third hopping on one leg, the fourth"
12274,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","backwards, and the fifth jumped in a sack. If any man think otherwise,"
12275,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","may he dance, that is to say, in a ten-acre meadow, with a mohawking"

12285,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","nine, and still they were at it, cross hands, down the middle, and back"
12286,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","again--’twas a mercy the bolt held. Chassez-croisez, dos-a-dos!--it was"

12288,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","my masters, for authority to interfere; but the Head of the Corporation"

12297,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.","The Sheriffs came next, and they gave in to the same whim and danced,"
12298,"AN EXTRAVAGANZA,--AFTER RABELAIS.",and so did three Phrenologists who were in waiting to take a cast of

12548,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"The word, with the great Lexicographer, signifies nothing but"

12554,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,
12555,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"When I was a young man, having a good deal of ready money, and little"
12556,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"wit,--I went upon the Turf. I began cautiously, and as I thought,"
12557,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"knowingly. I studied the studbook, and learnt the pedigree of every"
12558,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"new colt--yet somehow, between sire and dam, continually losing “the"
12559,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,pony.” My first experiment was at Newmarket. By way of securing a
12560,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"leading article, I backed the Duke of _Leeds_, but the race came off,"
12561,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"and the Duke was not placed. I asked eagerly who was _first_, and"
12562,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"was told _Fourth_. The winner was a slow but strong horse, and I was"
12563,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"informed had got in front by being a _laster_. This was a _puzzle_, but"
12564,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"I paid for my Riddlesworth, and prepared for the Derby. By good luck"
12565,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,I selected an excellent colt to stand upon--he had been tried--it was
12566,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"a booked thing--but the day before the Derby there was a family wash,"
12567,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,and the Laundress hung her wet linen on his _lines_. I paid again.
12568,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"I took advice about the Oaks, and instead of backing a single horse,"
12569,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"made my stand, like Ducrow, upon four at once. No luck. Terror did not"
12570,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"start--Fury came roaring to the post--Belle was told out, and Comet"
12571,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"was tail’d off. I paid again--and began dabbling in the Sweepstakes,"
12572,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"and burning my fingers with the Matches. Amongst others, a bet offered"
12573,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"that I conceived was peculiarly tempting, 20,000 to 20 against Post"
12574,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"Obit--a bad horse indeed, yet such odds seemed unjustifiable, even"
12575,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,against “an outsider.” But I soon found my mistake. The outsider was in
12576,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"reality an insider,--filling the stomachs of somebody’s hounds.--Pay"
12577,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"again! I resolved however to retaliate, and the opportunity presented"
12578,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,itself. I had been confidently informed that Centipede had not a leg to
12579,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"stand on, and accordingly laid against him as thick as it would stick."
12580,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,The following was the report of the race: “Centipede jumped off at a
12581,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"tremendous pace,--had it all his own way--and justified his name by"
12582,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,coming in a hundred feet in front.”--Pay again! These “hollow” matters
12583,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"however fretted me little, save in pocket. They were won easy, and lost"
12584,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,to match--but the “near things” were unbearable. To lose only by half
12585,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"a head,--a few inches of horse-flesh! I remember two occasions when"
12586,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"Giraffe won by “a neck,” and Elephant by “a nose.” I was almost tempted"
12587,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"to blow out my brains by the nose, and to hang myself by the neck!"
12588,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,
12589,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"On one of those doubtful occasions, when it is difficult to name the"
12590,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"winner, I thought I could determine the point, from some peculiar"
12591,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"advantage of situation, and offered to back my opinion. I laid that"
12592,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"Cobbler had won, and it was taken; but a signal from a friend decided"
12593,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"me that I was wrong, and by way of hedge, I offered to lay that Tinker"
12594,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"was the first horse. This was taken like the other, and the Judges"
12595,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,declared a dead rob--I mean to say a dead heat.--Pay again!
12596,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,
12597,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"A likelier chance next offered. There was a difference of opinion,"
12598,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"whether Bohea would start for the Cup, and his noble owner had"
12599,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,privately and positively assured me that he would. I therefore betted
12600,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"freely that he would _run_ for the Plate, and he _walked_ over!--Pay"
12601,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"again! N.B. I found, when it was too late, that I should not have paid"
12602,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"in this case, but I did."
12603,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,
12604,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"The Great St. Leger was still in reserve. Somewhat desperate, I betted"
12605,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"round, in sums of the same shape, and my best winner became first"
12606,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,favourite at the start. Never shall I forget the sight! I saw him come
12607,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,in ten lengths a-head of everything--hollow! hollow! I had no voice to
12608,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"shout with, and it was fortunate. Man and horse went, as usual, after"
12609,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"the race, to be weighed, and were put into the scale. They rose a"
12610,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"little in our eyes, and sunk proportionably in our estimation. Roguery"
12611,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"was sniffed--the Jockey Club was appealed to, and it gave the stakes to"

12613,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,
12614,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,It was time to cut the turf--and I was in a mood for burning it too.
12615,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"I was done by Heath, but the impression on my fortune was not in the"
12616,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"finished style. I now turned my attention to aquatics, and having been"
12617,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"unfortunate at the One Tun, tried my luck in a vessel of twenty. I"
12618,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"became a member of a Yacht Club, made matches which I lost--and sailed"
12619,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"for a Cup at the Cowes’ Regatta, but carried away nothing but my own"
12620,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"bowsprit. Other boats showed more speed, but mine most bottom; for"
12621,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"after the match it upset, and I was picked up by a party of fishermen,"
12622,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"who spared my life and took all I had, by way of teaching me, that a"
12623,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,preserving is not a saving.--Pay again!

12627,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"It was time to dispose of The Lucky Lass. I left her to the mate,"
12628,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,with peremptory orders to make a sale of her;--an instruction he
12629,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"fulfilled by making all the sail on her he could, and disposing of"
12630,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"her--by contract--to a rock, while he was threading the Needles. In"
12631,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,the meantime I betook myself to the chase. Sir W. W. had just cut
12632,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"his pack, and I undertook to deal with the dogs:--but I found dog’s"
12633,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"meat a dear item, though my friends killed my hunters for me, and I"
12634,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"boil’d my own horses. The subscribers, moreover, were not punctual,"
12635,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"and whatever differences fell out, I was obliged to make them up.--Pay"
12636,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,again! At last I happened to have a dispute with a brother Nimrod as
12637,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"to the capability of his Brown and mine, and we agreed to decide their"
12638,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"respective rates, as church rates, by a Steeple Chase. The wager was"
12639,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,heavy. I rode for the wrong steeple--leapt a dozen gates--and succeeded
12640,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,in clearing my own pocket.--Pay again!

12644,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"It was now necessary to retrench. I gave up hunting the county, lest"
12645,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"the county should repay it in kind, for I was now getting into its"
12646,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"debt. I laid down my horses and took up a gun, leased a shooting-box,"
12647,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"and rented a manor, somewhat too far north for me, for after a few"
12648,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"moves, I ascertained that the game had been drawn before I took to it."
12649,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"It was useless therefore to try to beat--the dogs, for want of birds,"
12650,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"began to point at butterflies. My friends, however, looked for grouse,"
12651,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,so I bought them and paid the carriage.--Pay again!
12652,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,
12653,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"Other experiments I must abridge. I found Pugilistic Sporting, as"

12655,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"were far exceeded by the “out-goes:”--and at the gaming table, that"
12656,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,it was very difficult to pay my way--particularly in coming back.
12657,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"In short I learned pages of meanings at school without trouble, but"
12658,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"the signification of that one word Sporting, in manhood has been a"
12659,THE PLEASURES OF SPORTING.,"long, and an uncomfortable lesson, and I have still an unconquerable"

12826,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12827,THE ABSTRACTION.,---- “draws honey forth that drives men mad.”--LALLA ROOKH.
12828,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12829,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12830,THE ABSTRACTION.,"The speakers were close under the bow-window of the inn, and as"
12831,THE ABSTRACTION.,"the sash was open, Curiosity herself could not help overhearing"
12832,THE ABSTRACTION.,their conversation. So I laid down Mrs. Opie’s “Illustrations of
12833,THE ABSTRACTION.,"Lying,”--which I had found lying in the inn window--and took a glance"
12834,THE ABSTRACTION.,at the partners in the dialogue.
12835,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12836,THE ABSTRACTION.,"One of them was much older than the other, and much taller; he seemed"
12837,THE ABSTRACTION.,to have grown like quick-set. The other was thick-set.
12838,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12839,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“I tell you, Thomas,” said Quickset, “you are a flat. Before you’ve"
12840,THE ABSTRACTION.,"been a day in London, they’ll have the teeth out of your very head. As"
12841,THE ABSTRACTION.,"for me, I’ve been there twice, and know what’s what. Take my advice:"
12842,THE ABSTRACTION.,never tell the truth on no account. Questions is only asked by way of
12843,THE ABSTRACTION.,pumping; and you ought always to put ’em on a wrong scent.”
12844,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12845,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“But aunt is to send her man to meet me at the Old Bailey,” said"
12846,THE ABSTRACTION.,"Thickset, “and to show me to her house. Now if a strange man says to"
12847,THE ABSTRACTION.,"me, ‘young man, are you Jacob Giles,’--an’t I to tell him?”"
12848,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12849,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“By no manner of means,” answered Quickset; “say you are quite another"
12850,THE ABSTRACTION.,man. No one but a flat would tell his name to a stranger about London.
12851,THE ABSTRACTION.,You see how I answered them last night about what was in the waggon.
12852,THE ABSTRACTION.,"Brooms, says I, nothing else. A flat would have told them there was the"
12853,THE ABSTRACTION.,"honey-pots underneath; but I’ve been to London before, and know a thing"
12854,THE ABSTRACTION.,or two.”
12855,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12856,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“London must be a desperate place,” said Thickset."
12857,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12858,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“Mortal!” said Quickset, “fobs and pockets are nothing! Your watch is"
12859,THE ABSTRACTION.,"hardly safe if you carried it in your inside, and as for money----”"
12860,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12861,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“I’m almost sorry I left Berkshire,” said Thickset."
12862,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12863,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“Poo--poo,” said Quickset, “don’t be afeard. I’ll look after ye; cheat"
12864,THE ABSTRACTION.,"me, and they’ve only one more to cheat. Only mind my advice. Don’t say"
12865,THE ABSTRACTION.,"anything of your own head, and don’t object to anything _I_ say. If I"
12866,THE ABSTRACTION.,"say black’s white, don’t contradict. Mark that. Say everything as I"
12867,THE ABSTRACTION.,say.”
12868,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12869,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“I understand what you mean,” said Thickset; and with this lesson in"
12870,THE ABSTRACTION.,"his shock head, he began to busy himself about the waggon, while his"
12871,THE ABSTRACTION.,comrade went to the stable for the horses. At last Old Ball emerged
12872,THE ABSTRACTION.,from the stable-door with the head of Old Dumpling resting on his
12873,THE ABSTRACTION.,"crupper; when a yell rose from the rear of the waggon, that startled"
12874,THE ABSTRACTION.,"even Number 55, at the Bush Inn, at Staines, and brought the company"
12875,THE ABSTRACTION.,running from the remotest box in its retired tea-garden.

12877,THE ABSTRACTION.,[Illustration: A TEA GARDEN.]

12880,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12881,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“It’s gone--all gone, by goles!” cried Thickset, with a bewildered look"
12882,THE ABSTRACTION.,"at Quickset, as if doubtful whether he ought not to have said it was"
12883,THE ABSTRACTION.,_not_ gone.
12884,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12885,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“You don’t mean to say the honey-pots!” said Quickset, with some"
12886,THE ABSTRACTION.,"alarm, and letting go the bridle of Old Ball, who very quietly led"
12887,THE ABSTRACTION.,old Dumpling back again into the stable; “you don’t mean to say the
12888,THE ABSTRACTION.,honey-pots?”
12889,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12890,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“I _don’t_ mean to say the honey-pots,” said Thickset, literally"
12891,THE ABSTRACTION.,following the instructions he had received.
12892,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12893,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“What made you screech out then?” said Quickset, appealing to Thickset."
12894,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12895,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“What made me screech out, then?” said Thickset, appealing to Quickset,"
12896,THE ABSTRACTION.,and determined to say as he said.
12897,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12898,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“The fellow’s drunk,” said the landlord; “the ale’s got into his head.”"
12899,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12900,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“Ale,--what ale has he had?” enquired Quickset rather anxiously."
12901,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12902,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“Ale,--what ale have I had?” echoed Thickset, looking sober with all"
12903,THE ABSTRACTION.,his might.
12904,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12905,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“He’s not drunk,” shouted Quickset; “there’s something the matter.”"
12906,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12907,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“I’m not drunk; there _is_ something the matter,” bellowed Thickset,"
12908,THE ABSTRACTION.,and with his fore-finger he pointed to the waggon.
12909,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12910,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“You don’t mean to say the honey,” said Quickset, his voice falling."
12911,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12912,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“I _don’t_ mean to say the honey,” said Thickset, his caution rising."
12913,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12914,THE ABSTRACTION.,"The gesture of Thickset, however, had conveyed some vague notion of"
12915,THE ABSTRACTION.,danger to his companion. With the agility of a cat he climbed on the
12916,THE ABSTRACTION.,"waggon, and with the superhuman activity of a demon, soon pitched down"
12917,THE ABSTRACTION.,"every bundle of besoms. There is a proverb that new brooms sweep clean,"
12918,THE ABSTRACTION.,and they certainly seemed to have swept every particle of honey clean
12919,THE ABSTRACTION.,out of the waggon.
12920,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12921,THE ABSTRACTION.,Quickset was thunderstruck; he stood gazing at the empty vehicle in
12922,THE ABSTRACTION.,"silence; while his hands wandered wildly through his hair, as if in"
12923,THE ABSTRACTION.,search of the absent combs.
12924,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12925,THE ABSTRACTION.,"When he found words at last, they were no part of the Litany. Words,"
12926,THE ABSTRACTION.,"however, did not suffice to vent his passion; and he began to stamp and"
12927,THE ABSTRACTION.,"dance about, till the mud of the stable-yard flew round like anything"
12928,THE ABSTRACTION.,you like.
12929,THE ABSTRACTION.,

12980,THE ABSTRACTION.,"Dumpling from the stable, while his companion tossed the brooms into"
12981,THE ABSTRACTION.,"the waggon. As soon as possible they drove out of the unlucky yard, and"
12982,THE ABSTRACTION.,"as they passed under the arch, I heard for the last time the voice of"
12983,THE ABSTRACTION.,Thickset:
12984,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12985,THE ABSTRACTION.,"“You’ve been to London before, and to be sure know best; but somehow,"
12986,THE ABSTRACTION.,"to my mind, the telling the untruth don’t seem to answer.”"
12987,THE ABSTRACTION.,
12988,THE ABSTRACTION.,"The only reply was a thwack, like the report of a pistol, on the"
12989,THE ABSTRACTION.,crupper of each of the horses. The poor animals broke directly into

13383,"HONNERED SUR,",and Fallo dears and cetra to have their horns Gilded and the
13384,"HONNERED SUR,",Mufflons and Sheaps is to hav pink ribbings round there nex. The

13414,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13415,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13416,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,The very earliest of one’s literary recollections must be the
13417,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,acquisition of the alphabet; and in the knowledge of the first
13418,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"rudiments I was placed on a par with the Learned Pig, by two maiden"
13419,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,ladies that were called Hogsflesh. The circumstance would be scarcely
13420,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"worth mentioning, but that being a day boarder, and taking my dinner"
13421,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"with the family, I became aware of a Baconian brother, who was never"
13422,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"mentioned except by his Initial, and was probably the prototype of"
13423,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the sensitive “Mr. H.” in Lamb’s unfortunate farce. The school in
13424,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"question was situated in Token-house Yard, a convenient distance for a"
13425,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"native of the Poultry, or Birchin-lane, I forget which, and in truth"
13426,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,am not particularly anxious to be more certainly acquainted with my
13427,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"parish. It was a metropolitan one, however, which is recorded without"
13428,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the slightest repugnance: firstly, for that, practically, I had no"
13429,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"choice in the matter; and secondly, because, theoretically, I would"
13430,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,as lief have been a native of London as of Stoke Pogis or little
13431,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Pedlington. If such local prejudices be of any worth, the balance"
13432,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ought to be in favour of the capital. The Dragon of Bow Church, or"
13433,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Gresham’s Grasshopper, is as good a terrestrial sign to be born under"
13434,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,as the dunghill cock on a village steeple. Next to being a citizen
13435,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of the world, it must be the best thing to be born a citizen of the"
13436,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"world’s greatest city. To a lover of his kind, it should be a welcome"
13437,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,dispensation that cast his nativity amidst the greatest congregation of
13438,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the species; but a literary man should exult rather than otherwise that
13439,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,he first saw the light--or perhaps the fog--in the same metropolis as
13440,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Milton, Gray, De Foe, Pope, Byron, Lamb, and other town-born authors,"
13441,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,whose fame has nevertheless triumphed over the Bills of Mortality. In
13442,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,such a goodly company I cheerfully take up my livery; and especially as
13443,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Cockneyism, properly so called, appears to be confined to no particular"
13444,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,locality or station in life. Sir Walter Scott has given a splendid
13445,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"instance of it in an Orcadian, who prayed to the Lord to bless his own"
13446,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"tiny ait, “not forgetting the neighbouring island of Great Britain:”"
13447,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and the most recent example of the style I have met with, was in the"
13448,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Memoirs of Sir William Knighton, being an account of sea perils and"
13449,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,sufferings during a passage across the Irish Channel by “the First
13450,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Gentleman in Europe.”
13451,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13452,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Having alluded to my first steps on the ladder of learning, it may"
13453,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,not be amiss in this place to correct an assertion of my biographer
13454,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in the Book of Gems, who states, that my education was finished at a"
13455,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"certain suburban academy. In this ignorant world, where we proverbially"
13456,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"live and learn, we may indeed leave off school, but our education only"
13457,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"terminates with life itself. But even in a more limited sense, instead"
13458,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of my education being finished, my own impression is, that it never"
13459,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,so much as progressed towards so desirable a consummation at any such
13460,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"establishment, although much invaluable time was spent at some of those"
13461,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"institutions where young gentlemen are literally boarded, lodged, and"
13462,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"_done for_. My very first essay was at one of those places, improperly"
13463,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"called _semi_-naries, because they do not half teach anything; the"
13464,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,principals being probably aware that the little boys are as often
13465,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"consigned to them to be “out of a mother’s way,” as for anything else."
13466,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Accordingly, my memory presents but a very dim image of a pedagogical"
13467,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"powdered head, amidst a more vivid group of females of a composite"
13468,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"charter-part dry-nurse, part housemaid, and part governess,--with a"
13469,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"matronly figure in the back ground, very like Mrs. S., allegorically"
13470,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"representing, as Milton says, “our universal mother.” But there is"
13471,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,no glimpse of Minerva. Of those pleasant associations with early
13472,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"school days, of which so much has been said and sung, there is little"
13473,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"amongst my retrospections, excepting, perhaps, some sports which, like"
13474,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"charity, might have been enjoyed at home, without the drawback of"
13475,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sundry strokes, neither apoplectic nor paralytic, periodical physic,"
13476,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,and other unwelcome extras. I am not sure whether an invincible
13477,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,repugnance to early rising may not be attributable to our precocious
13478,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"wintry summonses, from a warm bed into a dim damp school-room, to play"
13479,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,at filling our heads on an empty stomach; and perhaps I owe my decided
13480,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sedentary habits to the disgust at our monotonous walks, or rather"
13481,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"processions, or maybe to the sufferings of those longer excursions"
13482,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of big and little, where a pair of compasses had to pace as far and"
13483,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as fast as a pair of tongs. Nevertheless, I yet recall, with wonder,"
13484,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the occasional visits of grown-up ex-scholars to their old school,"
13485,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,all in a flutter of gratitude and sensibility at recognising the spot
13486,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"where they had been caned, and horsed, and flogged, and fagged, and"
13487,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"brimstone-and-treacled, and blackdosed and stickjawed, and kibed, and"
13488,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"fined,--where they had caught the measles and the mumps, and been"
13489,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"overtasked, and undertaught--and then, by way of climax, sentimentally"
13490,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"offering a presentation snuff-box to their revered preceptor, with an"
13491,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"inscription, ten to one, in dog Latin on the lid!"
13492,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13493,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"For my own part, were I to revisit such a haunt of my youth, it"
13494,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"would give me the greatest pleasure, out of mere regard to the"
13495,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"rising generation, to find Prospect House turned into a Floor Cloth"
13496,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Manufactory, and the playground converted to a bleachfield. The"
13497,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"tabatière is out of the question. In the way of learning, I carried off"
13498,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"nothing in exchange for my knife and fork, and spoon, but a prize for"
13499,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Latin without knowing the Latin for prize, and a belief which I had"
13500,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"afterwards to unbelieve again, that a block of marble could be cut in"
13501,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,two with a razor.
13502,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13503,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"To be classical, as Ducrow would say, the Athenians, the day before"
13504,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the Festival of Theseus, their Founder, gratefully sacrificed a ram,"
13505,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"in memory of Corridas the schoolmaster, who had been his instructor:"
13506,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"but in the present day, were such offerings in fashion, how frequently"
13507,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"would the appropriate animal be a donkey, and especially too big a"
13508,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,donkey to get over the Pons Asinorum!
13509,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13510,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"From the preparatory school, I was transplanted in due time to what is"
13511,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"called by courtesy, a finishing one, where I was immediately set to"
13512,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,begin everything again at the beginning. As this was but a backward way
13513,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of coming forward, there seemed little chance of my ever becoming what"
13514,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Mrs. Malaprop calls “a progeny of learning;” indeed my education was
13515,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,pursued very much after the plan laid down by that feminine authority.
13516,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I had nothing to do with Hebrew, or Algebra, or Simony, or Fluxions, or"
13517,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Paradoxes, or such inflammatory branches; but I obtained a supercilious"
13518,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"knowledge of accounts, with enough of geometry to make me acquainted"
13519,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"with the contagious countries. Moreover, I became fluent enough in"
13520,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,some unknown tongue to protect me from the French Mark; and I was
13521,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,sufficiently at home (during the vacations) in the quibbles of English
13522,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"grammar, to bore all my parents, relations, friends, and acquaintance,"
13523,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,by a pedantical mending of their “cakeology.” Such was the sum total
13524,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of my acquirements; being, probably, quite as much as I should have"
13525,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"learned at a Charity School, with the exception of the parochial"
13526,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,accomplishment of hallooing and singing of anthems.
13527,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13528,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I have entered into these personal details, though pertaining rather"
13529,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to illiterate than to literary reminiscences, partly because the"
13530,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"important subject of Education has become of prominent interest, and"
13531,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,partly to hint that a writer may often mean in earnest what he says
13532,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,in jest. One of my readers at least has given me credit for a serious
13533,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"purpose. A schoolmaster called, during the vacation, on the father of"
13534,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"one of his pupils, and in answer to his announcement of the re-opening"
13535,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of his establishment, was informed that the young gentleman was not to"
13536,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,return to the academy. The worthy parent declared that he had read the
13537,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"“Carnaby Correspondence” in the Comic Annual, and had made up his mind."
13538,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"“But, my dear Sir,” expostulated the pedagogue, “you cannot be serious;"
13539,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"why the Comic Annual is nothing but a book full of jokes!” “Yes, yes,”"
13540,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"returned the father, “but it has let me into a few of your tricks. I"
13541,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,believe Mr. Hood. James is not coming again!”
13542,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13543,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"And now, it may be reasonably asked, where I did learn anything if not"
13544,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"at these establishments, which promise Universal Knowledge--extras"
13545,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,included--and yet unaccountably produce so very few Admirable
13546,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Crichtons?[4] It may plausibly be objected, that I did not duly avail"
13547,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"myself of such overflowing opportunities to dabble, dip, duck in, and"
13548,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"drink deeply of the Pierian spring, that I was an Idler, Lounger,"
13549,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Tatler, Rambler, Spectator, anything rather than a student. To which"
13550,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"my reply must be, first, that the severest punishment ever inflicted"
13551,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"on my shoulders was for a scholar-like offence, the being “fond of my"
13552,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"book,” only it happened to be Robinson Crusoe; and secondly, that I did"
13553,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"go ahead at another guess sort of academy, a reference to which will"
13554,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"be little flattering to those Houses which claim Socrates, Aristotle,"
13555,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Alfred, and other _Learnedissimi Worthii_, as their Sponsors and"
13556,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Patron Saints. The school that really schooled me being comparatively
13557,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,of a very humble order--without sign--without prospectus--without
13558,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ushers--without ample and commodious premises--in short, without"
13559,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"pretension, and consequently, almost without custom."
13560,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13561,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"The autumn of the year 1811, along with a most portentous comet, “with"
13562,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"fear of change perplexing monarchs,” brought, alas! a melancholy"
13563,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"revolution in my own position and prospects, by the untimely death of"
13564,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"my father; and my elder brother shortly following him to the grave, my"
13565,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,bereaved mother naturally drew the fragments of the family more closely
13566,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"around her, so that thenceforward her dearest care was to keep her"
13567,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"“only son, myself, at home.” She did not, however, neglect my future"
13568,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"interest, or persuade herself by any maternal vanity that a boy of"
13569,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,twelve years old could have precociously finished his education; and
13570,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,accordingly the next spring found me at what might have been literally
13571,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"called a High School, in reference to its distance from the ground."
13572,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13573,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"In a house, formerly a suburban seat of the unfortunate Earl of"
13574,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Essex--over a grocer’s shop--up two pair of stairs, there was a very"
13575,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"select day-school, kept by a decayed Dominie, as he would have been"
13576,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"called in his native land. In his better days, when my brother was his"
13577,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"pupil, he had been master of one of those wholesale concerns in which"
13578,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"so many ignorant men have made fortunes, by favour of high terms, low"
13579,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"ushers, gullible parents, and victimised little boys. As our worthy"
13580,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Dominie, on the contrary, had failed to realise even a competence,"
13581,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"it may be inferred, logically, that he had done better by his pupils"
13582,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,than by himself; and my own experience certainly went to prove that
13583,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"he attended to the interests of his scholars, however he might have"
13584,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"neglected his own. Indeed, he less resembled, even in externals, the"
13585,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"modern worldly trading Schoolmaster, than the good, honest, earnest,"
13586,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"olden Pedagogue--a pedant, perchance, but a learned one, with whom"
13587,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"teaching was “a labour of love,” who had a proper sense of the dignity"
13588,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and importance of his calling, and was content to find a main portion"
13589,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,of his reward in the honourable proficiency of his disciples. Small as
13590,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"was our College, its Principal maintained his state, and walked gowned"
13591,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and covered. His cap was of faded velvet, of black, or blue, or purple,"
13592,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"or sad green, or as it seemed, of all together, with a _nuance_ of"
13593,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"brown. His robe, of crimson damask, lined with the national tartan. A"
13594,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"quaint, carved, highbacked, elbowed article, looking like an _émigré_,"
13595,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"from a set that had been at home in an aristocratical drawing-room,"
13596,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"under the _ancien régime_, was his Professional Chair, which with his"
13597,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"desk was appropriately elevated on a dais, some inches above the common"
13598,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"floor. From this moral and material eminence, he cast a vigilant yet"
13599,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"kindly eye over some dozen of youngsters; for adversity, sharpened by"
13600,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"habits of authority, had not soured him, or mingled a single tinge"
13601,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of bile with the peculiar red-streak complexion, so common to the"
13602,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"healthier natives of the North. On one solitary occasion, within my"
13603,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"memory, was he seriously yet characteristically discomposed, and that"
13604,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"was by his own daughter, whom he accused of “forgetting all regard for"
13605,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"common decorum;” because, forgetting that he was a Dominie as well"
13606,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as a Parent, she had heedlessly addressed him in public as “Father,”"
13607,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,instead of “Papa.” The mere provoking contrariety of a dunce never
13608,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"stirred his spleen, but rather spurred his endeavour, in spite of the"
13609,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"axiom, to make Nihil fit for anything. He loved teaching for teaching’s"
13610,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"sake; his kill-horse happened to be his hobby: and doubtless, if he had"
13611,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"met with a penniless boy on the road to learning, he would have given"
13612,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"him a lift, like the charitable Waggoner to Dick Whittington--for love."
13613,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"I recall, therefore, with pleasure, the cheerful alacrity with which I"
13614,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"used to step up to recite my lesson, constantly forewarned--for every"
13615,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,true schoolmaster has his stock joke--not to “stand in my own light.”
13616,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,It was impossible not to take an interest in learning what he seemed
13617,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,so interested in teaching; and in a few months my education progressed
13618,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,infinitely farther than it had done in as many years under the listless
13619,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"superintendence of B. A., and L. L. D. and Assistants. I picked up"
13620,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"_some_ Latin, was a tolerable English Grammarian, and so good a French"
13621,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"scholar, that I earned a few guineas--my first literary fee--by"
13622,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"revising a new edition of “Paul et Virginie” for the press. Moreover,"
13623,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"as an accountant, I could work a _summum bonum_--i.e. a good sum."
13624,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,
13625,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"In the mean time,--so generally unfortunate is the courtship of that"
13626,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"bashful undertoned wooer, Modest Merit, to that loud, brazen masculine,"
13627,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"worldly heiress, Success--the school did not prosper. The number"
13628,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,of scholars diminished rather that increased. At least no new boys
13629,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"came--but one fine morning, about nine o’clock, a great “she gal,”"
13630,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"of fifteen or sixteen, but so remarkably well grown that she might"
13631,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"have been “any of our mothers,” made her unexpected appearance with"
13632,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,bag and books. The sensation that she excited is not to be described!
13633,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"The apparition of a Governess, with a Proclamation of a Gynecocracy"
13634,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,could not have been more astounding! Of course SHE instantly formed a
13635,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,class; and had any form SHE might prefer to herself:--the most of us
13636,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,being just old enough to resent what was considered as an affront on
13637,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the corduroy sex, and just young enough to be beneath any gallantry"
13638,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"to the silken one. The truth was, sub rosa, that there was a plan"
13639,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"for translating us, and turning the unsuccessful Boys’ School into a"
13640,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Ladies’ Academy; to be conducted by the Dominie’s eldest daughter--but
13641,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,it had been thought prudent to be well on with the new set before being
13642,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"off with the old. A brief period only had elapsed, when, lo! a leash of"
13643,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"female school _Fellows_--three sisters, like the Degrees of Comparison"
13644,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"personified, Big, Bigger, and Biggest--made their unwelcome appearance,"
13645,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"and threatened to push us from our stools. They were greeted,"
13646,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"accordingly, with all the annoyances that juvenile malice could"
13647,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"suggest. It is amusing, yet humiliating, to remember the nuisances"
13648,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,the sex endured at the hands of those who were thereafter to honour
13649,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"the shadow of its shoe-tie--to groan, moan, sigh, and sicken for its"
13650,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"smiles--to become poetical, prosaical, nonsensical, lack-a-daisical,"
13651,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,and perhaps even melodramatical for its sake. Numberless were the
13652,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"desk-quakes, the ink-spouts, the book-bolts, the pea-showers, and"
13653,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"other unregistered phenomena, which likened the studies of those four"
13654,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"unlucky maidens to the “Pursuit of Knowledge under Difficulties,”--so"
13655,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"that it glads me to reflect, that I was in a very small minority"
13656,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"against the persecution; having already begun to read poetry, and"
13657,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,even to write something which was egregiously mistaken for something
13658,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,of the same nature. The final result of the struggle in the academic
13659,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"nest--whether the hen-cuckoos succeeded in ousting the cock-sparrows,"
13660,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,or vice versa--is beyond my record; seeing that I was just then removed
13661,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"from the scene of contest, to be introduced into that Universal School"
13662,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"where, as in the preparatory ones, we have very unequal shares in the"
13663,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"flogging, the fagging, the task-work, and the pocket-money; but the"
13664,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"same breaking-up to expect, and the same eternity of happy holidays to"
13665,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,hope for in the Grand Recess.

13667,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"In brief, a friend of the family having taken a fancy to me, proposed"
13668,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,to initiate me in those profitable mercantile mysteries which enabled
13669,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,Sir Thomas Gresham to gild his grasshopper; and like another Frank
13670,LITERARY REMINISCENCES.,"Osbaldestone, I found myself planted on a counting-house stool, which"
