461,(A FRAGMENT.),Like to the notes of some sweet instrument.
462,(A FRAGMENT.),"So did I reach and strain, until at last"
463,(A FRAGMENT.),I caught the soul athwart the grosser flesh.
464,(A FRAGMENT.),"Again of thee, sweet Hope, my spirit dreamed!"
465,(A FRAGMENT.),"I, guided by his wisdom and his love,"
466,(A FRAGMENT.),"Led by his words, and counselled by his care,"
467,(A FRAGMENT.),"Should lift the shrouding veil from things which be,"
468,(A FRAGMENT.),And at the flowing fountain of his soul
469,(A FRAGMENT.),Refresh my thirsting spirit....
470,(A FRAGMENT.),"And indeed,"
471,(A FRAGMENT.),In those long days which followed that strange day
472,(A FRAGMENT.),"When rites and song, and sacrifice and flow’rs,"
473,(A FRAGMENT.),"Proclaimed that we were wedded, did I learn,"
474,(A FRAGMENT.),"In sooth, a-many lessons; bitter ones"
475,(A FRAGMENT.),"Which sorrow taught me, and not love inspired,"
476,(A FRAGMENT.),Which deeper knowledge of my kind impressed
477,(A FRAGMENT.),With dark insistence on reluctant brain;--
478,(A FRAGMENT.),"But that great wisdom, deeper, which dispels"
479,(A FRAGMENT.),"Narrowed conclusions of a half-grown mind,"
480,(A FRAGMENT.),And sees athwart the littleness of life
481,(A FRAGMENT.),"Nature’s divineness and her harmony,"
482,(A FRAGMENT.),Was never poor Xantippe’s....
483,(A FRAGMENT.),I would pause
484,(A FRAGMENT.),"And would recall no more, no more of life,"
485,(A FRAGMENT.),"Than just the incomplete, imperfect dream"
486,(A FRAGMENT.),"Of early summers, with their light and shade,"
487,(A FRAGMENT.),"Their blossom-hopes, whose fruit was never ripe;"
488,(A FRAGMENT.),"But something strong within me, some sad chord"
489,(A FRAGMENT.),"Which loudly echoes to the later life,"
490,(A FRAGMENT.),Me to unfold the after-misery
491,(A FRAGMENT.),"Urges, with plaintive wailing in my heart."
492,(A FRAGMENT.),"Yet, maidens, mark; I would not that ye thought"
493,(A FRAGMENT.),"I blame my lord departed, for he meant"
494,(A FRAGMENT.),"No evil, so I take it, to his wife."
495,(A FRAGMENT.),"’Twas only that the high philosopher,"
496,(A FRAGMENT.),"Pregnant with noble theories and great thoughts,"
497,(A FRAGMENT.),Deigned not to stoop to touch so slight a thing
498,(A FRAGMENT.),As the fine fabric of a woman’s brain--
499,(A FRAGMENT.),So subtle as a passionate woman’s soul.
500,(A FRAGMENT.),"I think, if he had stooped a little, and cared,"
501,(A FRAGMENT.),"I might have risen nearer to his height,"
502,(A FRAGMENT.),"And not lain shattered, neither fit for use"
503,(A FRAGMENT.),"As goodly household vessel, nor for that"
504,(A FRAGMENT.),Far finer thing which I had hoped to be....
505,(A FRAGMENT.),"Death, holding high his retrospective lamp,"
506,(A FRAGMENT.),"Shows me those first, far years of wedded life,"
507,(A FRAGMENT.),Ere I had learnt to grasp the barren shape
508,(A FRAGMENT.),Of what the Fates had destined for my life
509,(A FRAGMENT.),"Then, as all youthful spirits are, was I"
510,(A FRAGMENT.),Wholly incredulous that Nature meant
511,(A FRAGMENT.),"So little, who had promised me so much."
512,(A FRAGMENT.),"At first I fought my fate with gentle words,"
513,(A FRAGMENT.),With high endeavours after greater things;
514,(A FRAGMENT.),"Striving to win the soul of Sokrates,"
515,(A FRAGMENT.),"Like some slight bird, who sings her burning love"
516,(A FRAGMENT.),"To human master, till at length she finds"
517,(A FRAGMENT.),"Her tender language wholly misconceived,"
518,(A FRAGMENT.),"And that same hand whose kind caress she sought,"
519,(A FRAGMENT.),With fingers flippant flings the careless corn....
520,(A FRAGMENT.),"I do remember how, one summer’s eve,"
521,(A FRAGMENT.),"He, seated in an arbour’s leafy shade,"
522,(A FRAGMENT.),Had bade me bring fresh wine-skins....
523,(A FRAGMENT.),As I stood
524,(A FRAGMENT.),"Ling’ring upon the threshold, half concealed"
525,(A FRAGMENT.),"By tender foliage, and my spirit light"
526,(A FRAGMENT.),"With draughts of sunny weather, did I mark"
527,(A FRAGMENT.),An instant the gay group before mine eyes.
528,(A FRAGMENT.),"Deepest in shade, and facing where I stood,"
529,(A FRAGMENT.),"Sat Plato, with his calm face and low brows"
530,(A FRAGMENT.),"Which met above the narrow Grecian eyes,"
531,(A FRAGMENT.),"The pale, thin lips just parted to the smile,"
532,(A FRAGMENT.),Which dimpled that smooth olive of his cheek.
533,(A FRAGMENT.),"His head a little bent, sat Sokrates,"
534,(A FRAGMENT.),"With one swart finger raised admonishing,"
535,(A FRAGMENT.),And on the air were borne his changing tones.
536,(A FRAGMENT.),"Low lounging at his feet, one fair arm thrown"
537,(A FRAGMENT.),"Around his knee (the other, high in air"
538,(A FRAGMENT.),"Brandish’d a brazen amphor, which yet rained"
539,(A FRAGMENT.),Bright drops of ruby on the golden locks
540,(A FRAGMENT.),"And temples with their fillets of the vine),"
541,(A FRAGMENT.),Lay Alkibiades the beautiful.
542,(A FRAGMENT.),"And thus, with solemn tone, spake Sokrates:"
543,(A FRAGMENT.),"“This fair Aspasia, which our Perikles"
544,(A FRAGMENT.),"Hath brought from realms afar, and set on high"
545,(A FRAGMENT.),"In our Athenian city, hath a mind,"
546,(A FRAGMENT.),"I doubt not, of a strength beyond her race;"
547,(A FRAGMENT.),"And makes employ of it, beyond the way"
548,(A FRAGMENT.),Of women nobly gifted: woman’s frail--
549,(A FRAGMENT.),Her body rarely stands the test of soul;
550,(A FRAGMENT.),She grows intoxicate with knowledge; throws
551,(A FRAGMENT.),"The laws of custom, order,’neath her feet,"
552,(A FRAGMENT.),Feasting at life’s great banquet with wide throat.”
553,(A FRAGMENT.),"Then sudden, stepping from my leafy screen,"
554,(A FRAGMENT.),"Holding the swelling wine-skin o’er my head,"
555,(A FRAGMENT.),"With breast that heaved, and eyes and cheeks aflame,"
556,(A FRAGMENT.),"Lit by a fury and a thought, I spake:"
557,(A FRAGMENT.),“By all great powers around us! can it be
558,(A FRAGMENT.),That we poor women are empirical?
559,(A FRAGMENT.),That gods who fashioned us did strive to make
560,(A FRAGMENT.),"Beings too fine, too subtly delicate,"
561,(A FRAGMENT.),With sense that thrilled response to ev’ry touch
562,(A FRAGMENT.),"Of nature’s, and their task is not complete?"
563,(A FRAGMENT.),That they have sent their half-completed work
564,(A FRAGMENT.),To bleed and quiver here upon the earth?
565,(A FRAGMENT.),"To bleed and quiver, and to weep and weep,"
566,(A FRAGMENT.),To beat its soul against the marble walls
567,(A FRAGMENT.),"Of men’s cold hearts, and then at last to sin!”"
568,(A FRAGMENT.),"I ceased, the first hot passion stayed and stemmed"
569,(A FRAGMENT.),"And frighted by the silence: I could see,"
570,(A FRAGMENT.),"Framed by the arbour foliage, which the sun"
571,(A FRAGMENT.),"In setting softly gilded with rich gold,"
572,(A FRAGMENT.),"Those upturned faces, and those placid limbs;"
573,(A FRAGMENT.),"Saw Plato’s narrow eyes and niggard mouth,"
574,(A FRAGMENT.),"Which half did smile and half did criticise,"
575,(A FRAGMENT.),"One hand held up, the shapely fingers framed"
576,(A FRAGMENT.),"To gesture of entreaty--“Hush, I pray,"
577,(A FRAGMENT.),Do not disturb her; let us hear the rest;
578,(A FRAGMENT.),"Follow her mood, for here’s another phase"
579,(A FRAGMENT.),Of your black-browed Xantippe....”
580,(A FRAGMENT.),Then I saw
581,(A FRAGMENT.),"Young Alkibiades, with laughing lips"
582,(A FRAGMENT.),"And half-shut eyes, contemptuous shrugging up"
583,(A FRAGMENT.),"Soft, snowy shoulders, till he brought the gold"
584,(A FRAGMENT.),Of flowing ringlets round about his breasts.
585,(A FRAGMENT.),"But Sokrates, all slow and solemnly,"
586,(A FRAGMENT.),"Raised, calm, his face to mine, and sudden spake:"
587,(A FRAGMENT.),“I thank thee for the wisdom which thy lips
588,(A FRAGMENT.),Have thus let fall among us: prythee tell
589,(A FRAGMENT.),"From what high source, from what philosophies"
590,(A FRAGMENT.),Didst cull the sapient notion of thy words?”
591,(A FRAGMENT.),"Then stood I straight and silent for a breath,"
592,(A FRAGMENT.),"Dumb, crushed with all that weight of cold contempt;"
593,(A FRAGMENT.),But swiftly in my bosom there uprose
594,(A FRAGMENT.),"A sudden flame, a merciful fury sent"
595,(A FRAGMENT.),To save me; with both angry hands I flung
596,(A FRAGMENT.),"The skin upon the marble, where it lay"
597,(A FRAGMENT.),Spouting red rills and fountains on the white;
598,(A FRAGMENT.),"Then, all unheeding faces, voices, eyes,"
599,(A FRAGMENT.),"I fled across the threshold, hair unbound--"
600,(A FRAGMENT.),White garment stained to redness--beating heart
601,(A FRAGMENT.),Flooded with all the flowing tide of hopes
602,(A FRAGMENT.),"Which once had gushed out golden, now sent back"
603,(A FRAGMENT.),"Swift to their sources, never more to rise...."
604,(A FRAGMENT.),"I think I could have borne the weary life,"
605,(A FRAGMENT.),"The narrow life within the narrow walls,"
606,(A FRAGMENT.),If he had loved me; but he kept his love
607,(A FRAGMENT.),For this Athenian city and her sons;
608,(A FRAGMENT.),"And, haply, for some stranger-woman, bold"
609,(A FRAGMENT.),"With freedom, thought, and glib philosophy...."
610,(A FRAGMENT.),"Ah me! the long, long weeping through the nights,"
611,(A FRAGMENT.),The weary watching for the pale-eyed dawn
612,(A FRAGMENT.),Which only brought fresh grieving: then I grew
613,(A FRAGMENT.),"Fiercer, and cursed from out my inmost heart"
614,(A FRAGMENT.),The Fates which marked me an Athenian maid.
615,(A FRAGMENT.),Then faded that vain fury; hope died out;
616,(A FRAGMENT.),"A huge despair was stealing on my soul,"
617,(A FRAGMENT.),"A sort of fierce acceptance of my fate,--"
618,(A FRAGMENT.),"He wished a household vessel--well ’twas good,"
619,(A FRAGMENT.),For he should have it! He should have no more
620,(A FRAGMENT.),"The yearning treasure of a woman’s love,"
621,(A FRAGMENT.),But just the baser treasure which he sought.
622,(A FRAGMENT.),"I called my maidens, ordered out the loom,"
623,(A FRAGMENT.),And spun unceasing from the morn till eve;
624,(A FRAGMENT.),"Watching all keenly over warp and woof,"
625,(A FRAGMENT.),Weighing the white wool with a jealous hand.
626,(A FRAGMENT.),"I spun until, methinks, I spun away"
627,(A FRAGMENT.),"The soul from out my body, the high thoughts"
628,(A FRAGMENT.),From out my spirit; till at last I grew
629,(A FRAGMENT.),"As ye have known me,--eye exact to mark"
630,(A FRAGMENT.),The texture of the spinning; ear all keen
631,(A FRAGMENT.),"For aimless talking when the moon is up,"
632,(A FRAGMENT.),And ye should be a-sleeping; tongue to cut
633,(A FRAGMENT.),"With quick incision, ’thwart the merry words"
634,(A FRAGMENT.),Of idle maidens....
635,(A FRAGMENT.),Only yesterday
636,(A FRAGMENT.),My hands did cease from spinning; I have wrought
637,(A FRAGMENT.),"My dreary duties, patient till the last."
638,(A FRAGMENT.),"The gods reward me! Nay, I will not tell"
639,(A FRAGMENT.),The after years of sorrow; wretched strife
640,(A FRAGMENT.),With grimmest foes--sad Want and Poverty;--
641,(A FRAGMENT.),"Nor yet the time of horror, when they bore"
642,(A FRAGMENT.),"My husband from the threshold; nay, nor when"
643,(A FRAGMENT.),The subtle weed had wrought its deadly work.
644,(A FRAGMENT.),Alas! alas! I was not there to soothe
645,(A FRAGMENT.),The last great moment; never any thought
646,(A FRAGMENT.),"Of her that loved him--save at least the charge,"
647,(A FRAGMENT.),"All earthly, that her body should not starve...."
648,(A FRAGMENT.),"You weep, you weep; I would not that ye wept;"
649,(A FRAGMENT.),"Such tears are idle; with the young, such grief"
650,(A FRAGMENT.),"Soon grows to gratulation, as, “her love"
651,(A FRAGMENT.),Was withered by misfortune; mine shall grow
652,(A FRAGMENT.),"All nurtured by the loving,” or, “her life"
653,(A FRAGMENT.),Was wrecked and shattered--mine shall smoothly sail.”
654,(A FRAGMENT.),"Enough, enough. In vain, in vain, in vain!"
655,(A FRAGMENT.),The gods forgive me! Sorely have I sinned
656,(A FRAGMENT.),In all my life. A fairer fate befall
657,(A FRAGMENT.),You all that stand there....
658,(A FRAGMENT.),Ha! the dawn has come;
659,(A FRAGMENT.),I see a rosy glimmer--nay! it grows dark;
660,(A FRAGMENT.),"Why stand ye so in silence? throw it wide,"
661,(A FRAGMENT.),"The casement, quick; why tarry?--give me air--"

693,MEDEA.,"To-day, that I am lone and weary and sad,"
694,MEDEA.,I fain would call back days of pride and hope;
695,MEDEA.,"Of pride in strength, when strength was all unprov’d,"
696,MEDEA.,"Of hope too high, too sweet, to be confined"
697,MEDEA.,In limits of conception.
698,MEDEA.,I am sad
699,MEDEA.,"Here in this gracious city, whose white walls"
700,MEDEA.,Gleam snow-like in the sunlight; whose fair shrines
701,MEDEA.,Are filled with wondrous images of gods;
702,MEDEA.,"Upon whose harbour’s bosom ride tall ships,"
703,MEDEA.,"Black-masted, fraught with fragrant merchandise;"
704,MEDEA.,"Whose straight-limbed people, in fair stuffs arrayed,"
705,MEDEA.,Do throng from morn till eve the sunny streets.

707,MEDEA.,"What, cunning workmanship and purple robes?"
708,MEDEA.,"Light of sweet sunlight, play and spray of waves?"
709,MEDEA.,"When all around the air is charged and chill,"
710,MEDEA.,And all the place is drear and dark with hate?
711,MEDEA.,"Alas, alas, this people loves me not!"
712,MEDEA.,"This strong, fair people, marble-cold and smooth"
713,MEDEA.,"As modelled marble. I, an alien here,"
714,MEDEA.,"That well can speak the language of their lips,"
715,MEDEA.,The language of their souls may never learn.

717,MEDEA.,"Ere now, a creature in whose veins ran blood"
718,MEDEA.,"Redder, more rapid, than flows round most hearts,"
719,MEDEA.,Do seem a creature reft of life and soul.
720,MEDEA.,If they would only teach the subtle trick
721,MEDEA.,"By which their hearts are melted into love,"
722,MEDEA.,I’d strive to learn it. I am very meek.
723,MEDEA.,"They think me proud, but I am very meek,"
724,MEDEA.,"Ready to do their bidding. Hear me, friends!"
725,MEDEA.,"Friends, I am very hungry, give me love!"
726,MEDEA.,’Tis all I ask! is it so hard to give?
727,MEDEA.,You stand and front me with your hostile eyes;
728,MEDEA.,You only give me hatred?
729,MEDEA.,Yet I know

733,MEDEA.,On summer evenings when the sky is fair.
734,MEDEA.,"O men and women, are ye then so hard?"

746,MEDEA.,With shadowy apprehension. May’t forbode
747,MEDEA.,No evil unto him I hold so dear;
748,MEDEA.,And ever dearer with the waxing years:--
749,MEDEA.,"For this indeed is woman’s chiefest curse,"
750,MEDEA.,That still her constant heart clings to its love
751,MEDEA.,Through all time and all chances; while the man
752,MEDEA.,"Is caught with newness; coldly calculates,"

884,MEDEA.,"Long prayers, poured out with blood and cries and tears?"
885,MEDEA.,"Lo, I who strove for strength have grown more weak"
886,MEDEA.,Than is the weakest. I have poured the sap
887,MEDEA.,"Of all my being, my life’s very life,"
888,MEDEA.,Before a thankless godhead; and am grown
889,MEDEA.,"No woman, but a monster. What avail"
890,MEDEA.,"Charms, spells and potions, all my hard-won arts,"
891,MEDEA.,"My mystic workings, seeing they cannot win"
892,MEDEA.,One little common spark of human love?
893,MEDEA.,"O gods, gods, ye have cursed me in this gift!"
894,MEDEA.,More should ye have withheld or more have giv’n;
895,MEDEA.,Have fashioned me more weak or else more strong.
896,MEDEA.,"Behold me now, your work, a thing of fear--"
897,MEDEA.,"From natural human fellowship cut off,"
898,MEDEA.,And yet a woman--sick and sore with pain;
899,MEDEA.,"Hungry for love and music of men’s praise,"
900,MEDEA.,"But walled about as with a mighty wall,"
901,MEDEA.,"Far from men’s reach and sight, alone, alone."

921,JASON.,"Hear me, Medea, if you still can hear"
922,JASON.,That seem so strangely lifted from yourself:
923,JASON.,"But I, that know you long, do know you well,"
924,JASON.,A thing of moods and passions; so I bear
925,JASON.,"Once more with your wild words and savage gests,"
926,JASON.,"Ay, and for all your fury speak you fair."
927,JASON.,"You say you love me. Can I deem it so,"
928,JASON.,When what does most advantage me and mine
929,JASON.,"You shrink to hear of? For I make no doubt,"
930,JASON.,Fleet-footed rumour did anticipate
931,JASON.,"The tidings I was hastening to bear,"
932,JASON.,"When you, wide-eyed, unveiled, unfilleted,"
933,JASON.,Rushed out upon me.
934,JASON.,Know then this once more:
935,JASON.,That I have sworn to take as wedded wife
936,JASON.,"Glaukê, the daughter of our mighty king,"
937,JASON.,"In this, in nowise hurting you and yours."
938,JASON.,"For you all fair provision I have made,"
939,JASON.,So but you get beyond the city walls
940,JASON.,Before the night comes on. Our little ones--
941,JASON.,They too shall journey with you. I have said.
942,JASON.,"And had I found you in a mood more mild,"
943,JASON.,"Less swayed by savage passion, I had told"
944,JASON.,"How this thing, which mayhap seems a thing hard,"
945,JASON.,"Is but a blessing, wrapped and cloaked about"
946,JASON.,In harsh disguisements. For tho’ Kreon rule
947,JASON.,"To-day within the city; Kreon dead,"
948,JASON.,"Who else shall rule there saving I alone,"
949,JASON.,The king’s son loved of him and other men?
950,JASON.,And in those days Medea’s sons and mine
951,JASON.,"Shall stand at my right hand, grown great in power."
952,JASON.,"Medea, too, if she do but control"
953,JASON.,"Her fiery spirit, may yet reign a queen"

968,NIKIAS.,"How high his gold-curled head, crisped like a girl’s."
969,NIKIAS.,And yet for all his curled locks and smooth tones
970,NIKIAS.,Jason is very strong. I never knew
971,NIKIAS.,A man of such a strange and subtle strength.
972,NIKIAS.,
973,ÆGEUS.,ÆGEUS.
974,ÆGEUS.,
975,ÆGEUS.,"The Colchian speaks no word; and her swart hands,"

977,ÆGEUS.,"In mad entreaty, are together clasped"
978,ÆGEUS.,Before her white robe in an iron clasp.
979,ÆGEUS.,"And her wild eyes, which erst did seek the heav’ns,"
980,ÆGEUS.,"And now her lord and now again the earth,"
981,ÆGEUS.,Are set on space and move not. The tall shape
982,ÆGEUS.,"Stands there erect and still. This calm, I think,"

999,MEDEA.,Seeing how much one gave and one how much.
1000,MEDEA.,"For you, you thought: This maid has served me well,"
1001,MEDEA.,And yet may serve me. When I touch her palm
1002,MEDEA.,The blood is set a-tingle in my veins;
1003,MEDEA.,For these things I will make her body mine.
1004,MEDEA.,"And I, I stood before you, clean and straight,"
1005,MEDEA.,A woman some deemed fair and all deemed wise;
1006,MEDEA.,"A woman, yet no simple thing nor slight,"
1007,MEDEA.,By nature fashioned in no niggard mould;
1008,MEDEA.,And looked into your eyes with eyes that spake:
1009,MEDEA.,"Lo, utterly, for ever, I am yours."
1010,MEDEA.,"And since that you, this gift I lavish laid"
1011,MEDEA.,"Low at your feet, have lightly held and spurned--"
1012,MEDEA.,"I in my two arms, thus, shall gather it up"
1013,MEDEA.,So that your feet may not encounter it
1014,MEDEA.,Which is not worthy for your feet to tread!
1015,MEDEA.,"Yet pause a moment, Jason. Haply now"
1016,MEDEA.,In some such wise as this your thoughts run on:
1017,MEDEA.,I loved this woman for a little space;
1018,MEDEA.,"Alas, poor soul, she loved me but too well--"
1019,MEDEA.,"It is the way with women! Some, I think,"
1020,MEDEA.,"Did deem her fierce; gods! she was meek enough,"
1021,MEDEA.,Content with what I gave; when I gave not
1022,MEDEA.,Nothing importunate.
1023,MEDEA.,"Ah, Jason, pause."
1024,MEDEA.,"You never knew Medea. You forget,"
1025,MEDEA.,"Because so long she bends the knee to you,"
1026,MEDEA.,She was not born to serfdom.
1027,MEDEA.,I have knelt
1028,MEDEA.,Too long before you. I have stood too long
1029,MEDEA.,Suppliant before this people. You forget
1030,MEDEA.,A redder stream flows in my Colchian veins
1031,MEDEA.,"Than the slow flood which courses round your hearts,"
1032,MEDEA.,"O cold Corinthians, with whom I long have dwelt"
1033,MEDEA.,And never ere this day have known myself.
1034,MEDEA.,"Nor have ye known me. Now behold me free,"
1035,MEDEA.,Ungyved by any chains of this man wrought;
1036,MEDEA.,Nothing desiring at your hands nor his.
1037,MEDEA.,"Free, freer than the air or winged birds;"
1038,MEDEA.,"Strong, stronger than the blast of wintry storms;"
1039,MEDEA.,And lifted up into an awful realm
1040,MEDEA.,"Where is nor love, nor pity, nor remorse,"
1041,MEDEA.,"Nor dread, but only purpose."
1042,MEDEA.,There shall be
1043,MEDEA.,A horror and a horror in this land;
1044,MEDEA.,"Woe upon woe, red blood and biting flame;"
1045,MEDEA.,Most horrid death and anguish worse than death;
1046,MEDEA.,Deeds that shall make the shores of Hades sound
1047,MEDEA.,With murmured terror; with an awful dread
1048,MEDEA.,Shall move the generations yet unborn;
1049,MEDEA.,A horror and a horror in the land.

1069,ÆGEUS.,ÆGEUS.
1070,ÆGEUS.,
1071,ÆGEUS.,"Alas, a bloody rumour reached mine ears"

1074,NIKIAS.,NIKIAS.
1075,NIKIAS.,
1076,NIKIAS.,"And by his side, his daughter; both caught up"

1080,NIKIAS.,
1081,ÆGEUS.,ÆGEUS.

1083,ÆGEUS.,Woe! Alas!
1084,ÆGEUS.,"Woe for the state, woe for our Kreon slain,"

1086,ÆGEUS.,But three times woe for her that did the deed--
1087,ÆGEUS.,Her womanhood sham’d; her children basely wrong’d.

1089,NIKIAS.,NIKIAS.
1090,NIKIAS.,
1091,NIKIAS.,"Hold back your pity till the tale be told,"
1092,NIKIAS.,For never was there horror like to this.
1093,NIKIAS.,"Ere now in Corinth, haply, you have heard"
1094,NIKIAS.,How she did use for her crime’s instruments
1095,NIKIAS.,The tender boys sprung from great Jason’s loins;
1096,NIKIAS.,Bidding them bear the garments wrought in Hell
1097,NIKIAS.,As bridal gifts to grace the marriage morn
1098,NIKIAS.,Of gold-hair’d Glaukê. Serpent! Sorceress!

1100,ÆGEUS.,ÆGEUS.
1101,ÆGEUS.,
1102,ÆGEUS.,"Alas, consider; so the tigress springs"
1103,ÆGEUS.,When that her cubs are menaced. ’Twas her love
1104,ÆGEUS.,"That wrought the deed--evil, yet wrought for love."
1105,ÆGEUS.,
1106,NIKIAS.,NIKIAS.
1107,NIKIAS.,
1108,NIKIAS.,"Spare me such love. I never yet could deem,"
1109,NIKIAS.,"Ev’n ere the horror, that Medea held"
1110,NIKIAS.,The love of human mothers in her breast.
1111,NIKIAS.,"For I have seen her, when her children played"
1112,NIKIAS.,"Their innocent, aimless sports about her knees,"
1113,NIKIAS.,"Or held her gown across the market-place,"
1114,NIKIAS.,Move all unheeding with her swart brows knit
1115,NIKIAS.,"And fierce eyes fixed; not, as is mothers’ wont,"
1116,NIKIAS.,"Eager to note the winning infant ways,"
1117,NIKIAS.,A-strain to catch the babbling treble tones
1118,NIKIAS.,Of soft lips clamouring for a kiss or smile.
1119,NIKIAS.,And once I marked her (’twas a summer’s morn)
1120,NIKIAS.,"Turn suddenly and, stooping, catch and strain"
1121,NIKIAS.,One tender infant to her breast. She held
1122,NIKIAS.,"Her lips to his and looked into his eyes,"
1123,NIKIAS.,"Not gladly, as a mother with her child,"
1124,NIKIAS.,But stirred by some strange passion; then the boy
1125,NIKIAS.,"Cried out with terror, and Medea wept."
1126,NIKIAS.,
1127,ÆGEUS.,ÆGEUS.

1129,ÆGEUS.,Your tale is strange.
1130,ÆGEUS.,

1133,NIKIAS.,Stranger is yet to come.
1134,NIKIAS.,"How that the Colchian did send forth her sons,"
1135,NIKIAS.,"Innocent doers of most deadly deed,"
1136,NIKIAS.,"Has reached your knowledge. When the deed was done,"
1137,NIKIAS.,And the dead king lay stretched upon the floor
1138,NIKIAS.,"Clutching his daughter in a last embrace,"
1139,NIKIAS.,Arose great clamour in the palace halls;
1140,NIKIAS.,Wailing and cries of terror; women’s screams;
1141,NIKIAS.,A rush of flying feet from hall to hall;
1142,NIKIAS.,The clanging fall of brazen instruments
1143,NIKIAS.,Upon the marble.
1144,NIKIAS.,"The two tender boys,"
1145,NIKIAS.,"Half apprehending what thing had befallen,"
1146,NIKIAS.,"Fled forth unmarked, and all affrighted reached"
1147,NIKIAS.,"The house of Jason, where Medea stood"
1148,NIKIAS.,Erect upon the threshold. From afar
1149,NIKIAS.,Sounded and surged the fiercely frighted roar
1150,NIKIAS.,"Of the roused city, and, like waves of the sea,"
1151,NIKIAS.,Grew nearer ev’ry beating of the pulse.
1152,NIKIAS.,"Forth from the inmost chambers fled the slaves,"
1153,NIKIAS.,Made fleet with sudden fear; the little ones
1154,NIKIAS.,"With arms outspread rushed to the Colchian,"
1155,NIKIAS.,"And clung about her limbs and caught her robe,"
1156,NIKIAS.,Hiding their faces.
1157,NIKIAS.,And Medea stood
1158,NIKIAS.,Calm as a carven image. As the sound
1159,NIKIAS.,"Of wrath and lamentation drew more near,"
1160,NIKIAS.,The pale lips seemed to smile. But when she saw
1161,NIKIAS.,"Her children clinging round her, she stretched forth"
1162,NIKIAS.,"One strong, swart hand and put the twain away,"
1163,NIKIAS.,And gathered up the trailing of her robe.
1164,NIKIAS.,"I saw the deed, I, Nikias, with these eyes!"
1165,NIKIAS.,Then spake she (Zeus! grant that I may not hear
1166,NIKIAS.,Such tones once more from human lips!). She spake:
1167,NIKIAS.,"“I will not have ye, for I love ye not!”"
1168,NIKIAS.,Then all her face grew alien. Those around
1169,NIKIAS.,"Stood still, not knowing what she planned."
1170,NIKIAS.,Then she
1171,NIKIAS.,Forth from her gathered garment swiftly drew
1172,NIKIAS.,A thing that gleamed and glinted; in the air
1173,NIKIAS.,She held it poised an instant; then--O gods!
1174,NIKIAS.,How shall I speak it?--on the marble floor
1175,NIKIAS.,Was blood that streamed and spurted; blood that flow’d
1176,NIKIAS.,"From two slain, innocent babes!"
1177,NIKIAS.,
1178,ÆGEUS.,ÆGEUS.
1179,ÆGEUS.,
1180,ÆGEUS.,O woful day!
1181,ÆGEUS.,
1182,NIKIAS.,NIKIAS.
1183,NIKIAS.,
1184,NIKIAS.,Then brake a cry from all about: a wail
1185,NIKIAS.,Of lamentation. But above the sound
1186,NIKIAS.,"A fierce long shriek, that froze the blood i’ the veins,"
1187,NIKIAS.,"Rang out and rose, cleaving the topmost cloud."
1188,NIKIAS.,
1189,ÆGEUS.,ÆGEUS.
1190,ÆGEUS.,
1191,ÆGEUS.,O evil deed! O essence of all evil
1192,ÆGEUS.,Stealing the shape of woman!
1193,ÆGEUS.,
1194,NIKIAS.,NIKIAS.
1195,NIKIAS.,
1196,NIKIAS.,After that
1197,NIKIAS.,All is confusion; from all sides surged up
1198,NIKIAS.,"The people, cursing, weeping. ’Thwart the din"
1199,NIKIAS.,Each other moment the strained ear might catch
1200,NIKIAS.,"Medea’s name, or Jason’s, or the King’s;"
1201,NIKIAS.,And women wailed out “Glaukê” through their tears.
1202,NIKIAS.,Then sudden came a pause; the angry roar
1203,NIKIAS.,Died down into a murmur; and the throng
1204,NIKIAS.,"Grew still, and rolled aside like a clov’n sea."
1205,NIKIAS.,And Jason strode between them till he reached
1206,NIKIAS.,"His own home’s threshold where the twain lay dead,"
1207,NIKIAS.,Long gazed he on their faces; then he turned
1208,NIKIAS.,To the hush’d people; turned to them and spake:
1209,NIKIAS.,"(His face was whiter than the dead’s, his eyes"
1210,NIKIAS.,Like to a creature’s that has looked on Hell)
1211,NIKIAS.,"“Where is the woman?” Lo, and when they sought"
1212,NIKIAS.,"Medea, no eye beheld her. And no man"
1213,NIKIAS.,Had looked upon her since that moment’s space
1214,NIKIAS.,When steel had flashed and blood foamed in the air.
1215,NIKIAS.,Then Jason stood erect and spake again:
1216,NIKIAS.,“Let no man seek this woman; blood enough
1217,NIKIAS.,Has stained our city. Let the furies rend
1218,NIKIAS.,Her guilty soul; nor we pollute our hands
1219,NIKIAS.,With her accursèd body....”
1220,NIKIAS.,
1221,ÆGEUS.,ÆGEUS.
1222,ÆGEUS.,
1223,ÆGEUS.,"Cease, my friend;"
1224,ÆGEUS.,It is enough. You judged this thing aright;
1225,ÆGEUS.,This woman was dark and evil in her soul;
1226,ÆGEUS.,Black to her fiend-heart’s root; a festering plague
1227,ÆGEUS.,In our fair city’s midst.
1228,ÆGEUS.,
1229,NIKIAS.,NIKIAS.
1230,NIKIAS.,
1231,NIKIAS.,Spake I not true?
1232,NIKIAS.,
1233,NIKIAS.,[_Night; outside the city._ MEDEA _leaning against a rock_.]
1234,NIKIAS.,
1235,NIKIAS.,"Here let me rest; beyond men’s eyes, beyond"
1236,NIKIAS.,The city’s hissing hate. Why am I here?
1237,NIKIAS.,"Why have I fled from death? There’s sun on the earth,"
1238,NIKIAS.,And in the shades no sun;--thus much I know;
1239,NIKIAS.,And sunlight’s good.
1240,NIKIAS.,"Wake I, or do I sleep?"
1241,NIKIAS.,"I’m weary, weary; once I dream’d a dream"
1242,NIKIAS.,Of one that strove and wept and yearned for love
1243,NIKIAS.,In a fair city. She was blind indeed.
1244,NIKIAS.,"They say the woman had a fiend at heart,"
1245,NIKIAS.,"And afterwards--Hush, hush, I dream’d a dream."
1246,NIKIAS.,"How cold the air blows; how the night grows dark,"
1247,NIKIAS.,Wrapping me round in blackness. Darker too
1248,NIKIAS.,Grows the deep night within. I cannot see;
1249,NIKIAS.,I grope with weary hands; my hands are sore
1250,NIKIAS.,With fruitless striving. I have fought with the Fates
1251,NIKIAS.,And I am vanquished utterly. The Fates
1252,NIKIAS.,"Yield not to strife; nay, nor to many prayers."
1253,NIKIAS.,Their ways are dark.
1254,NIKIAS.,One climbs the tree and grasps
1255,NIKIAS.,"A handful of dead leaves; another walks,"
1256,NIKIAS.,"Heedless, beneath the branches, and the fruit"
1257,NIKIAS.,Falls mellow at his feet.
1258,NIKIAS.,This is the end:
1259,NIKIAS.,I have dash’d my heart against a rock; the blood
1260,NIKIAS.,Is drain’d and flows no more; and all my breast
1261,NIKIAS.,Is emptied of its tears.
1262,NIKIAS.,Thus go I forth
1263,NIKIAS.,"Into the deep, dense heart of the night--alone."
