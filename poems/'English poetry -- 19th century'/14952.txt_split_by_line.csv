93,MICHAEL,
94,A PASTORAL POEM,A PASTORAL POEM
95,A PASTORAL POEM,
96,A PASTORAL POEM,If from the public way you turn your steps
97,A PASTORAL POEM,"Up the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,"
98,A PASTORAL POEM,You will suppose that with an upright path
99,A PASTORAL POEM,Your feet must struggle; in such bold ascent
100,A PASTORAL POEM,"The pastoral mountains front you, face to face."
101,A PASTORAL POEM,"But, courage! for around that boisterous brook"
102,A PASTORAL POEM,"The mountains have all opened out themselves,"
103,A PASTORAL POEM,And made a hidden valley of their own.
104,A PASTORAL POEM,No habitation can be seen; but they
105,A PASTORAL POEM,Who journey thither find themselves alone                 10
106,A PASTORAL POEM,"With a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites"
107,A PASTORAL POEM,That overhead are sailing in the sky.
108,A PASTORAL POEM,It is in truth an utter solitude;
109,A PASTORAL POEM,Nor should I have made mention of this Dell
110,A PASTORAL POEM,"But for one object which you might pass by,               15"
111,A PASTORAL POEM,Might see and notice not.  Beside the brook
112,A PASTORAL POEM,"Appears a straggling heap of unhewn stones,"
113,A PASTORAL POEM,And to that simple object appertains
114,A PASTORAL POEM,"A story,--unenriched with strange events,"
115,A PASTORAL POEM,"Yet not unfit, I deem, for the fireside,                  20"
116,A PASTORAL POEM,Or for the summer shade.  It was the first
117,A PASTORAL POEM,Of those domestic tales that spake to me
118,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of Shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men"
119,A PASTORAL POEM,Whom I already loved:--not verily
120,A PASTORAL POEM,"For their own sakes, but for the fields and hills         25"
121,A PASTORAL POEM,Where was their occupation and abode.
122,A PASTORAL POEM,"And hence this Tale, while I was yet a Boy"
123,A PASTORAL POEM,"Careless of books, yet having felt the power"
124,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of Nature, by the gentle agency"
125,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of natural objects, led me on to feel                     30"
126,A PASTORAL POEM,"For passions that were not my own, and think"
127,A PASTORAL POEM,(At random and imperfectly indeed)
128,A PASTORAL POEM,"On man, the heart of man, and human life."
129,A PASTORAL POEM,"Therefore, although it be a history"
130,A PASTORAL POEM,"Homely and rude, I will relate the same                   35"
131,A PASTORAL POEM,For the delight of a few natural hearts;
132,A PASTORAL POEM,"And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake"
133,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of youthful Poets, who among these hills"
134,A PASTORAL POEM,Will be my second self when I am gone.
135,A PASTORAL POEM,
136,A PASTORAL POEM,Upon the forest-side in Grasmere Vale                     40
137,A PASTORAL POEM,"There dwelt a Shepherd, Michael was his name;"
138,A PASTORAL POEM,"An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb."
139,A PASTORAL POEM,His bodily frame had been from youth to age
140,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of an unusual strength: his mind was keen,"
141,A PASTORAL POEM,"Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,                 45"
142,A PASTORAL POEM,And in his shepherd's calling he was prompt
143,A PASTORAL POEM,And watchful more than ordinary men.
144,A PASTORAL POEM,"Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds,"
145,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of blasts of every tone; and oftentimes,"
146,A PASTORAL POEM,"When others heeded not, he heard the South                50"
147,A PASTORAL POEM,"Make subterraneous music, like the noise"
148,A PASTORAL POEM,Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.
149,A PASTORAL POEM,"The Shepherd, at such warning, of his flock"
150,A PASTORAL POEM,"Bethought him, and he to himself would say,"
151,A PASTORAL POEM,"""The winds are now devising work for me!""                 55"
152,A PASTORAL POEM,"And, truly, at all times, the storm, that drives"
153,A PASTORAL POEM,"The traveller to a shelter, summoned him"
154,A PASTORAL POEM,Up to the mountains: he had been alone
155,A PASTORAL POEM,"Amid the heart of many thousand mists,"
156,A PASTORAL POEM,"That came to him, and left him, on the heights.           60"
157,A PASTORAL POEM,So lived he till his eightieth year was past.
158,A PASTORAL POEM,"And grossly that man errs, who should suppose"
159,A PASTORAL POEM,"That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks,"
160,A PASTORAL POEM,Were things indifferent to the Shepherd's thoughts.
161,A PASTORAL POEM,"Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed       65"
162,A PASTORAL POEM,"The common air; hills, which with vigorous step"
163,A PASTORAL POEM,He had so often climbed; which had impressed
164,A PASTORAL POEM,So many incidents upon his mind
165,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of hardship, skill or courage, joy or fear;"
166,A PASTORAL POEM,"Which, like a book, preserved the memory                  70"
167,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of the dumb animals whom he had saved,"
168,A PASTORAL POEM,"Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts"
169,A PASTORAL POEM,The certainty of honorable gain;
170,A PASTORAL POEM,"Those fields, those hills--what could they less?--had laid"
171,A PASTORAL POEM,"Strong hold on his affections, were to him                75"
172,A PASTORAL POEM,"A pleasurable feeling of blind love,"
173,A PASTORAL POEM,The pleasure which there is in life itself.
174,A PASTORAL POEM,
175,A PASTORAL POEM,His days had not been passed in singleness.
176,A PASTORAL POEM,"His Helpmate was a comely matron, old--"
177,A PASTORAL POEM,Though younger than himself full twenty years.            80
178,A PASTORAL POEM,"She was a woman of a stirring life,"
179,A PASTORAL POEM,Whose heart was in her house: two wheels she had
180,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of antique form; this large, for spinning wool;"
181,A PASTORAL POEM,"That small, for flax; and if one wheel had rest,"
182,A PASTORAL POEM,It was because the other was at work.                     85
183,A PASTORAL POEM,"The Pair had but one inmate in their house,"
184,A PASTORAL POEM,"An only Child, who had been born to them"
185,A PASTORAL POEM,"When Michael, telling o'er his years, began"
186,A PASTORAL POEM,"To deem that he was old,--in shepherd's phrase,"
187,A PASTORAL POEM,"With one foot in the grave.  This only Son,               90"
188,A PASTORAL POEM,"With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,"
189,A PASTORAL POEM,"The one of an inestimable worth,"
190,A PASTORAL POEM,Made all their household.  I may truly say
191,A PASTORAL POEM,That they were as a proverb in the vale
192,A PASTORAL POEM,"For endless industry.  When day was gone,                 95"
193,A PASTORAL POEM,And from their occupations out of doors
194,A PASTORAL POEM,"The Son and Father were come home, even then"
195,A PASTORAL POEM,Their labor did not cease; unless when all
196,A PASTORAL POEM,"Turned to the cleanly supper board, and there,"
197,A PASTORAL POEM,"Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,            100"
198,A PASTORAL POEM,"Sat round the basket piled with oaten cakes,"
199,A PASTORAL POEM,And their plain home-made cheese.  Yet when the meal
200,A PASTORAL POEM,"Was ended, Luke (for so the Son was named)"
201,A PASTORAL POEM,And his old Father both betook themselves
202,A PASTORAL POEM,To such convenient work as might employ                  105
203,A PASTORAL POEM,Their hands by the fireside; perhaps to card
204,A PASTORAL POEM,"Wool for the Housewife's spindle, or repair"
205,A PASTORAL POEM,"Some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,"
206,A PASTORAL POEM,Or other implement of house or field.
207,A PASTORAL POEM,
208,A PASTORAL POEM,"Down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge,            110"
209,A PASTORAL POEM,That in our ancient uncouth country style
210,A PASTORAL POEM,With huge and black projection overbrowed
211,A PASTORAL POEM,"Large space beneath, as duly as the light"
212,A PASTORAL POEM,Of day grew dim the Housewife hung a lamp;
213,A PASTORAL POEM,"An agèd utensil, which had performed                     115"
214,A PASTORAL POEM,Service beyond all others of its kind.
215,A PASTORAL POEM,"Early at evening did it burn,--and late,"
216,A PASTORAL POEM,"Surviving comrade of uncounted hours,"
217,A PASTORAL POEM,"Which, going by from year to year, had found,"
218,A PASTORAL POEM,And left the couple neither gay perhaps                  120
219,A PASTORAL POEM,"Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,"
220,A PASTORAL POEM,Living a life of eager industry.
221,A PASTORAL POEM,"And now, when Luke had reached his eighteenth year,"
222,A PASTORAL POEM,"There by the light of this old lamp they sate,"
223,A PASTORAL POEM,"Father and Son, while far into the night                 125"
224,A PASTORAL POEM,"The Housewife plied her own peculiar work,"
225,A PASTORAL POEM,Making the cottage through the silent hours
226,A PASTORAL POEM,Murmur as with the sound of summer flies.
227,A PASTORAL POEM,"This light was famous in its neighborhood,"
228,A PASTORAL POEM,And was a public symbol of the life                      130
229,A PASTORAL POEM,"That thrifty Pair had lived.  For, as it chanced;"
230,A PASTORAL POEM,Their cottage on a plot of rising ground
231,A PASTORAL POEM,"Stood single, with large prospect, north and south,"
232,A PASTORAL POEM,"High into Easedale, up to Dunmail-Raise,"
233,A PASTORAL POEM,And westward to the village near the lake;               135
234,A PASTORAL POEM,"And from this constant light, so regular,"
235,A PASTORAL POEM,"And so far seen, the House itself, by all"
236,A PASTORAL POEM,"Who dwelt within the limits of the vale,"
237,A PASTORAL POEM,"Both old and young, was named the EVENING STAR."
238,A PASTORAL POEM,
239,A PASTORAL POEM,"Thus living on through such a length of years,           140"
240,A PASTORAL POEM,"The Shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs"
241,A PASTORAL POEM,Have loved his Helpmate; but to Michael's heart
242,A PASTORAL POEM,This son of his old age was yet more dear--
243,A PASTORAL POEM,"Less from instinctive tenderness, the same"
244,A PASTORAL POEM,Fond spirit that blindly works in the blood of all--     145
245,A PASTORAL POEM,"Than that a child, more than all other gifts"
246,A PASTORAL POEM,"That earth can offer to declining man,"
247,A PASTORAL POEM,"Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,"
248,A PASTORAL POEM,"And stirrings of inquietude, when they"
249,A PASTORAL POEM,By tendency of nature needs must fail.                   150
250,A PASTORAL POEM,"Exceeding was the love he bare to him,"
251,A PASTORAL POEM,His heart and his heart's joy!  For oftentimes
252,A PASTORAL POEM,"Old Michael, while he was a babe in arms,"
253,A PASTORAL POEM,"Had done him female service, not alone"
254,A PASTORAL POEM,"For pastime and delight, as is the use                   155"
255,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced"
256,A PASTORAL POEM,To acts of tenderness; and he had rocked
257,A PASTORAL POEM,"His cradle, as with a woman's gentle hand."
258,A PASTORAL POEM,"And in a later time, ere yet the Boy"
259,A PASTORAL POEM,"Had put on boy's attire, did Michael love,               160"
260,A PASTORAL POEM,"Albeit of a stern, unbending mind,"
261,A PASTORAL POEM,"To have the Young-one in his sight, when he"
262,A PASTORAL POEM,"Wrought in the field, or on his shepherd's stool"
263,A PASTORAL POEM,Sat with a fettered sheep before him stretched
264,A PASTORAL POEM,"Under the large old oak, that near his door              165"
265,A PASTORAL POEM,"Stood single, and, from matchless depth of shade,"
266,A PASTORAL POEM,"Chosen for the shearer's covert from the sun,"
267,A PASTORAL POEM,Thence in our rustic dialect was called
268,A PASTORAL POEM,"The CLIPPING TREE, a name which yet it bears."
269,A PASTORAL POEM,"There, while they two were sitting in the shade,         170"
270,A PASTORAL POEM,"With others round them, earnest all and blithe,"
271,A PASTORAL POEM,Would Michael exercise his heart with looks
272,A PASTORAL POEM,Of fond correction and reproof bestowed
273,A PASTORAL POEM,"Upon the Child, if he disturbed the sheep"
274,A PASTORAL POEM,"By catching at their legs, or with his shouts            175"
275,A PASTORAL POEM,Scared them while they lay still beneath the shears.
276,A PASTORAL POEM,
277,A PASTORAL POEM,And when by Heaven's good grace the Boy grew up
278,A PASTORAL POEM,"A healthy Lad, and carried in his cheek"
279,A PASTORAL POEM,Two steady roses that were five years old;
280,A PASTORAL POEM,Then Michael from a winter coppice cut                   180
281,A PASTORAL POEM,"With his own hand a sapling, which he hooped"
282,A PASTORAL POEM,"With iron, making it throughout in all"
283,A PASTORAL POEM,"Due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff,"
284,A PASTORAL POEM,And gave it to the Boy; wherewith equipped
285,A PASTORAL POEM,He as a watchman oftentimes was placed                   185
286,A PASTORAL POEM,"At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock;"
287,A PASTORAL POEM,"And, to his office prematurely called,"
288,A PASTORAL POEM,"There stood the urchin, as you will divine,"
289,A PASTORAL POEM,Something between a hindrance and a help;
290,A PASTORAL POEM,"And for this cause not always, I believe,                190"
291,A PASTORAL POEM,Receiving from his Father hire of praise;
292,A PASTORAL POEM,"Though naught was left undone which staff, or voice,"
293,A PASTORAL POEM,"Or looks, or threatening gestures, could perform,"
294,A PASTORAL POEM,
295,A PASTORAL POEM,"But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand"
296,A PASTORAL POEM,"Against the mountain blasts; and to the heights,         195"
297,A PASTORAL POEM,"Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,"
298,A PASTORAL POEM,"He with his Father daily went, and they"
299,A PASTORAL POEM,"Were as companions, why should I relate"
300,A PASTORAL POEM,That objects which the Shepherd loved before
301,A PASTORAL POEM,Were dearer now? that from the Boy there came            200
302,A PASTORAL POEM,"Feelings and emanations,--things which were"
303,A PASTORAL POEM,Light to the sun and music to the wind;
304,A PASTORAL POEM,And that the old Man's heart seemed born again?
305,A PASTORAL POEM,
306,A PASTORAL POEM,Thus in his Father's sight the boy grew up:
307,A PASTORAL POEM,"And now, when he had reached his eighteenth year,        205"
308,A PASTORAL POEM,He was his comfort and his daily hope.
309,A PASTORAL POEM,
310,A PASTORAL POEM,While in this sort the simple household lived
311,A PASTORAL POEM,"From day to day, to Michael's ear there came"
312,A PASTORAL POEM,Distressful tidings.  Long before the time
313,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of which I speak, the Shepherd had been bound            210"
314,A PASTORAL POEM,"In surety for his brother's son, a man"
315,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of an industrious life, and ample means;"
316,A PASTORAL POEM,But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly
317,A PASTORAL POEM,Had pressed upon him; and old Michael now
318,A PASTORAL POEM,"Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture,                215"
319,A PASTORAL POEM,"A grievous penalty, but little less"
320,A PASTORAL POEM,"Than half his substance.  This unlooked-for claim,"
321,A PASTORAL POEM,"At the first hearing, for a moment took"
322,A PASTORAL POEM,More hope out of his life than he supposed
323,A PASTORAL POEM,That any old man ever could have lost.                   220
324,A PASTORAL POEM,As soon as he had armed himself with strength
325,A PASTORAL POEM,"To look his trouble in the face, it seemed"
326,A PASTORAL POEM,The Shepherd's sole resource to sell at once
327,A PASTORAL POEM,A portion of his patrimonial fields.
328,A PASTORAL POEM,"Such was his first resolve; he thought again,            225"
329,A PASTORAL POEM,"And his heart failed him.  ""Isabel,"" said he,"
330,A PASTORAL POEM,"Two evenings after he had heard the news,"
331,A PASTORAL POEM,"""I have been toiling more than seventy years,"
332,A PASTORAL POEM,And in the open sunshine of God's love
333,A PASTORAL POEM,Have we all lived; yet if these fields of ours           230
334,A PASTORAL POEM,"Should pass into a stranger's hand, I think"
335,A PASTORAL POEM,That I could not lie quiet in my grave.
336,A PASTORAL POEM,Our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself
337,A PASTORAL POEM,Has scarcely been more diligent than I;
338,A PASTORAL POEM,And I have lived to be a fool at last                    235
339,A PASTORAL POEM,To my own family.  An evil man
340,A PASTORAL POEM,"That was, and made an evil choice, if he"
341,A PASTORAL POEM,"Were false to us; and if he were not false,"
342,A PASTORAL POEM,There are ten thousand to whom loss like this
343,A PASTORAL POEM,Had been no sorrow.  I forgive him;--but                 240
344,A PASTORAL POEM,'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.
345,A PASTORAL POEM,
346,A PASTORAL POEM,"""When I began, my purpose was to speak"
347,A PASTORAL POEM,Of remedies and of a cheerful hope.
348,A PASTORAL POEM,"Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land"
349,A PASTORAL POEM,"Shall not go from us, and it shall be free;              245"
350,A PASTORAL POEM,"He shall possess it, free as is the wind"
351,A PASTORAL POEM,"That passes over it.  We have, thou know'st,"
352,A PASTORAL POEM,Another kinsman; he will be our friend
353,A PASTORAL POEM,"In this distress.  He is a prosperous man,"
354,A PASTORAL POEM,"Thriving in trade; and Luke to him shall go,             250"
355,A PASTORAL POEM,And with his kinsman's help and his own thrift
356,A PASTORAL POEM,"He quickly will repair this loss, and then"
357,A PASTORAL POEM,"He may return to us.  If here he stay,"
358,A PASTORAL POEM,"What can be done?  Where every one is poor,"
359,A PASTORAL POEM,"What can be gained?"""
360,A PASTORAL POEM,
361,A PASTORAL POEM,"At this the old Man paused,                              255"
362,A PASTORAL POEM,"And Isabel sat silent, for her mind"
363,A PASTORAL POEM,"Was busy, looking back into past times."
364,A PASTORAL POEM,"There's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself,"
365,A PASTORAL POEM,"He was a parish-boy,--at the church-door"
366,A PASTORAL POEM,"They made a gathering for him, shillings, pence,         260"
367,A PASTORAL POEM,"And half-pennies, wherewith the neighbors bought"
368,A PASTORAL POEM,"A basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;"
369,A PASTORAL POEM,"And, with his basket on his arm, the lad"
370,A PASTORAL POEM,"Went up to London, found a master there,"
371,A PASTORAL POEM,"Who, out of many, chose the trusty boy                   265"
372,A PASTORAL POEM,To go and overlook his merchandise
373,A PASTORAL POEM,"Beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich,"
374,A PASTORAL POEM,"And left estates and moneys to the poor,"
375,A PASTORAL POEM,"And at his birthplace built a chapel, floored"
376,A PASTORAL POEM,"With marble, which he sent from foreign lands.           270"
377,A PASTORAL POEM,"These thoughts, and many others of like sort,"
378,A PASTORAL POEM,Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel
379,A PASTORAL POEM,"And her face brightened.  The old Man was glad,"
380,A PASTORAL POEM,"And thus resumed: ""Well, Isabel, this scheme,"
381,A PASTORAL POEM,"These two days, has been meat and drink to me.           275"
382,A PASTORAL POEM,Far more than we have lost is left us yet.
383,A PASTORAL POEM,--We have enough--I wish indeed that I
384,A PASTORAL POEM,Were younger;--but this hope is a good hope.
385,A PASTORAL POEM,"Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best"
386,A PASTORAL POEM,"Buy for him more, and let us send him forth              280"
387,A PASTORAL POEM,"To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night:"
388,A PASTORAL POEM,"--If he _could_ go, the Boy should go to-night."""
389,A PASTORAL POEM,
390,A PASTORAL POEM,"Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth"
391,A PASTORAL POEM,With a light heart.  The Housewife for five days
392,A PASTORAL POEM,"Was restless morn and night, and all day long            285"
393,A PASTORAL POEM,Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare
394,A PASTORAL POEM,Things needful for the journey of her son.
395,A PASTORAL POEM,But Isabel was glad when Sunday came
396,A PASTORAL POEM,"To stop her in her work; for, when she lay"
397,A PASTORAL POEM,"By Michael's side, she through the last two nights       290"
398,A PASTORAL POEM,"Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep:"
399,A PASTORAL POEM,And when they rose at morning she could see
400,A PASTORAL POEM,That all his hopes were gone.  That day at noon
401,A PASTORAL POEM,"She said to Luke, while they two by themselves"
402,A PASTORAL POEM,"Were sitting at the door, ""Thou must not go:             295"
403,A PASTORAL POEM,"We have no other Child but thee to lose,"
404,A PASTORAL POEM,"None to remember--do not go away,"
405,A PASTORAL POEM,"For if thou leave thy Father he will die."""
406,A PASTORAL POEM,The Youth made answer with a jocund voice;
407,A PASTORAL POEM,"And Isabel, when she had told her fears,                 300"
408,A PASTORAL POEM,Recovered heart.  That evening her best fare
409,A PASTORAL POEM,"Did she bring forth, and all together sat"
410,A PASTORAL POEM,Like happy people round a Christmas fire.
411,A PASTORAL POEM,
412,A PASTORAL POEM,With daylight Isabel resumed her work;
413,A PASTORAL POEM,And all the ensuing week the house appeared              305
414,A PASTORAL POEM,As cheerful as a grove in Spring: at length
415,A PASTORAL POEM,"The expected letter from their kinsman came,"
416,A PASTORAL POEM,With kind assurances that he would do
417,A PASTORAL POEM,His utmost for the welfare of the Boy;
418,A PASTORAL POEM,"To which requests were added, that forthwith             310"
419,A PASTORAL POEM,He might be sent to him.  Ten times or more
420,A PASTORAL POEM,The letter was read over; Isabel
421,A PASTORAL POEM,Went forth to show it to the neighbors round;
422,A PASTORAL POEM,Nor was there at that time on English land
423,A PASTORAL POEM,A prouder heart than Luke's.  When Isabel                315
424,A PASTORAL POEM,"Had to her house returned, the old Man said,"
425,A PASTORAL POEM,"""He shall depart to-morrow.""  To this word"
426,A PASTORAL POEM,"The Housewife answered, talking much of things"
427,A PASTORAL POEM,"Which, if at such short notice he should go,"
428,A PASTORAL POEM,Would surely be forgotten.  But at length                320
429,A PASTORAL POEM,"She gave consent, and Michael was at ease."
430,A PASTORAL POEM,"Near the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,"
431,A PASTORAL POEM,"In that deep valley, Michael had designed"
432,A PASTORAL POEM,"To build a Sheep-fold; and, before he heard"
433,A PASTORAL POEM,"The tidings of his melancholy loss,                      325"
434,A PASTORAL POEM,For this same purpose he had gathered up
435,A PASTORAL POEM,"A heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge"
436,A PASTORAL POEM,"Lay thrown together, ready for the work."
437,A PASTORAL POEM,With Luke that evening thitherward he walked;
438,A PASTORAL POEM,"And soon as they had reached the place he stopped,       330"
439,A PASTORAL POEM,"And thus the old man spake to him:--""My Son,"
440,A PASTORAL POEM,To-morrow thou wilt leave me; with full heart
441,A PASTORAL POEM,"I look upon thee, for thou art the same"
442,A PASTORAL POEM,That wert a promise to me ere thy birth
443,A PASTORAL POEM,And all thy life hast been my daily joy.                 335
444,A PASTORAL POEM,I will relate to thee some little part
445,A PASTORAL POEM,Of our two histories; 'twill do thee good
446,A PASTORAL POEM,"When thou art from me, even if I should touch"
447,A PASTORAL POEM,On things thou canst not know of.------After thou
448,A PASTORAL POEM,First cam'st into the world--as oft befalls              340
449,A PASTORAL POEM,To newborn infants--thou didst sleep away
450,A PASTORAL POEM,"Two days, and blessings from thy Father's tongue"
451,A PASTORAL POEM,"Then fell upon thee.  Day by day passed on,"
452,A PASTORAL POEM,And still I loved thee with increasing love.
453,A PASTORAL POEM,Never to living ear came sweeter sounds                  345
454,A PASTORAL POEM,Than when I heard thee by our own fireside
455,A PASTORAL POEM,"First uttering, without words, a natural tune;"
456,A PASTORAL POEM,"While thou, a feeding babe, didst in thy joy"
457,A PASTORAL POEM,"Sing at thy Mother's breast.  Month followed month,"
458,A PASTORAL POEM,"And in the open fields my life was passed,               350"
459,A PASTORAL POEM,And on the mountains; else I think that thou
460,A PASTORAL POEM,Hadst been brought up upon thy Father's knees.
461,A PASTORAL POEM,"But we were playmates, Luke; among these hills,"
462,A PASTORAL POEM,"As well thou knowest, in us the old and young"
463,A PASTORAL POEM,"Have played together, nor with me didst thou             355"
464,A PASTORAL POEM,"Lack any pleasure which a boy can know."""
465,A PASTORAL POEM,Luke had a manly heart; but at these words
466,A PASTORAL POEM,"He sobbed aloud.  The old Man grasped his hand,"
467,A PASTORAL POEM,"And said, ""Nay, do not take it so--I see"
468,A PASTORAL POEM,That these are things of which I need not speak.         360
469,A PASTORAL POEM,--Even to the utmost I have been to thee
470,A PASTORAL POEM,A kind and a good Father; and herein
471,A PASTORAL POEM,I but repay a gift which I myself
472,A PASTORAL POEM,"Received at others' hands; for, though now old"
473,A PASTORAL POEM,"Beyond the common life of man, I still                   365"
474,A PASTORAL POEM,Remember them who loved me in my youth.
475,A PASTORAL POEM,"Both of them sleep together; here they lived,"
476,A PASTORAL POEM,"As all their Forefathers had done; and, when"
477,A PASTORAL POEM,"At length their time was come, they were not loath"
478,A PASTORAL POEM,To give their bodies to the family mould.                370
479,A PASTORAL POEM,I wished that thou should'st live the life they lived;
480,A PASTORAL POEM,"But 'tis a long time to look back, my Son,"
481,A PASTORAL POEM,And see so little gain from threescore years.
482,A PASTORAL POEM,These fields were burthened when they came to me;
483,A PASTORAL POEM,"Till I was forty years of age, not more                  375"
484,A PASTORAL POEM,Than half of my inheritance was mine.
485,A PASTORAL POEM,"I toiled and toiled; God blessed me in my work,"
486,A PASTORAL POEM,And till the three weeks past the land was free.
487,A PASTORAL POEM,--It looks as if it never could endure
488,A PASTORAL POEM,"Another Master.  Heaven forgive me, Luke,                380"
489,A PASTORAL POEM,"If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good"
490,A PASTORAL POEM,"That thou shouldst go."""
491,A PASTORAL POEM,
492,A PASTORAL POEM,At this the old Man paused;
493,A PASTORAL POEM,"Then, pointing to the stones near which they stood,"
494,A PASTORAL POEM,"Thus, after a short silence, he resumed:"
495,A PASTORAL POEM,"""This was a work for us; and now, my Son,                385"
496,A PASTORAL POEM,"It is a work for me.  But, lay one stone,--"
497,A PASTORAL POEM,"Here, lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands."
498,A PASTORAL POEM,"Nay, Boy, be of good hope; we both may live"
499,A PASTORAL POEM,To see a better day.  At eighty-four
500,A PASTORAL POEM,I still am strong and hale;--do thou thy part;           390
501,A PASTORAL POEM,I will do mine.--I will begin again
502,A PASTORAL POEM,With many tasks that were resigned to thee;
503,A PASTORAL POEM,"Up to the heights, and in among the storms,"
504,A PASTORAL POEM,"Will I without thee go again, and do"
505,A PASTORAL POEM,"All works which I was wont to do alone,                  395"
506,A PASTORAL POEM,"Before I knew thy face.  Heaven bless thee, Boy!"
507,A PASTORAL POEM,Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast
508,A PASTORAL POEM,"With many hopes; it should be so--yes, yes,--"
509,A PASTORAL POEM,I knew that thou couldst never have a wish
510,A PASTORAL POEM,"To leave me, Luke; thou hast been bound to me            400"
511,A PASTORAL POEM,Only by links of love: when thou art gone
512,A PASTORAL POEM,What will be left to us!--But I forget
513,A PASTORAL POEM,"My purposes.  Lay now the corner-stone,"
514,A PASTORAL POEM,"As I requested; and hereafter, Luke,"
515,A PASTORAL POEM,"When thou art gone away, should evil men                 405"
516,A PASTORAL POEM,"Be thy companions, think of me, my Son,"
517,A PASTORAL POEM,"And of this moment; hither turn thy thoughts,"
518,A PASTORAL POEM,And God will strengthen thee: amid all fear
519,A PASTORAL POEM,"And all temptation, Luke, I pray that thou"
520,A PASTORAL POEM,"May'st bear in mind the life thy Fathers lived,          410"
521,A PASTORAL POEM,"Who, being innocent, did for that cause"
522,A PASTORAL POEM,"Bestir them in good deeds.  Now, fare thee well--"
523,A PASTORAL POEM,"When thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see"
524,A PASTORAL POEM,A work which is not here: a covenant
525,A PASTORAL POEM,"'Twill be between us; but, whatever fate                 415"
526,A PASTORAL POEM,"Befall thee, I shall love thee to the last,"
527,A PASTORAL POEM,"And bear thy memory with me to the grave."""
528,A PASTORAL POEM,
529,A PASTORAL POEM,"The Shepherd ended here; and Luke stooped down,"
530,A PASTORAL POEM,"And, as his Father had requested, laid"
531,A PASTORAL POEM,The first stone of the Sheep-fold.  At the sight         420
532,A PASTORAL POEM,The old Man's grief broke from him; to his heart
533,A PASTORAL POEM,"He pressed his Son, he kissed him and wept;"
534,A PASTORAL POEM,And to the house together they returned.
535,A PASTORAL POEM,"--Hushed was that House in peace, or seeming peace,"
536,A PASTORAL POEM,Ere the night fell:--with morrow's dawn the Boy          425
537,A PASTORAL POEM,"Began his journey, and when he had reached"
538,A PASTORAL POEM,"The public way, he put on a bold face;"
539,A PASTORAL POEM,"And all the neighbors, as he passed their doors,"
540,A PASTORAL POEM,"Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers,"
541,A PASTORAL POEM,That followed him till he was out of sight.              430
542,A PASTORAL POEM,
543,A PASTORAL POEM,"A good report did from their Kinsman come,"
544,A PASTORAL POEM,Of Luke and his well doing: and the Boy
545,A PASTORAL POEM,"Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,"
546,A PASTORAL POEM,"Which, as the Housewife phrased it, were throughout"
547,A PASTORAL POEM,"""The prettiest letters that were ever seen.""             435"
548,A PASTORAL POEM,Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.
549,A PASTORAL POEM,"So, many months passed on; and once again"
550,A PASTORAL POEM,The Shepherd went about his daily work
551,A PASTORAL POEM,With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now
552,A PASTORAL POEM,Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour              440
553,A PASTORAL POEM,"He to that valley took his way, and there"
554,A PASTORAL POEM,Wrought at the Sheep-fold.  Meantime Luke began
555,A PASTORAL POEM,"To slacken in his duty; and, at length,"
556,A PASTORAL POEM,He in the dissolute city gave himself
557,A PASTORAL POEM,To evil courses: ignominy and shame                      445
558,A PASTORAL POEM,"Fell on him, so that he was driven at last"
559,A PASTORAL POEM,To seek a hiding place beyond the seas.
560,A PASTORAL POEM,
561,A PASTORAL POEM,There is a comfort in the strength of love;
562,A PASTORAL POEM,"'Twill make a thing endurable, which else"
563,A PASTORAL POEM,"Would overset the brain, or break the heart:             450"
564,A PASTORAL POEM,I have conversed with more than one who well
565,A PASTORAL POEM,"Remember the old Man, and what he was"
566,A PASTORAL POEM,Years after he had heard this heavy news.
567,A PASTORAL POEM,His bodily frame had been from youth to age
568,A PASTORAL POEM,Of an unusual strength.  Among the rocks                 455
569,A PASTORAL POEM,"He went, and still looked up to sun and cloud,"
570,A PASTORAL POEM,"And listened to the wind; and, as before,"
571,A PASTORAL POEM,"Performed all kinds of labor for his sheep,"
572,A PASTORAL POEM,"And for the land, his small inheritance."
573,A PASTORAL POEM,And to that hollow dell from time to time                460
574,A PASTORAL POEM,"Did he repair, to build the Fold of which"
575,A PASTORAL POEM,His flock had need.  'Tis not forgotten yet
576,A PASTORAL POEM,The pity which was then in every heart
577,A PASTORAL POEM,For the old Man--and 'tis believed by all
578,A PASTORAL POEM,"That many and many a day he thither went,                465"
579,A PASTORAL POEM,And never lifted up a single stone.
580,A PASTORAL POEM,
581,A PASTORAL POEM,"There by the Sheep-fold, sometimes was he seen"
582,A PASTORAL POEM,"Sitting alone, or with his faithful Dog,"
583,A PASTORAL POEM,"Then old, beside him, lying at his feet."
584,A PASTORAL POEM,"The length of full seven years, from time to time        570"
585,A PASTORAL POEM,"He at the building of this Sheep-fold wrought,"
586,A PASTORAL POEM,And left the work unfinished when he died.
587,A PASTORAL POEM,"Three years, or little more, did Isabel"
588,A PASTORAL POEM,Survive her Husband; at her death the estate
589,A PASTORAL POEM,"Was sold, and went into a stranger's hand.               475"
590,A PASTORAL POEM,The Cottage which was named the EVENING STAR
591,A PASTORAL POEM,"Is gone,--the ploughshare has been through the ground"
592,A PASTORAL POEM,On which it stood; great changes have been wrought
593,A PASTORAL POEM,"In all the neighborhood:--yet the oak is left,"
594,A PASTORAL POEM,That grew beside their door; and the remains             480
595,A PASTORAL POEM,Of the unfinished Sheep-fold may be seen

602,A PASTORAL POEM,5. THE PASTORAL MOUNTAINS.  In Professor Knight's _Life of Wordsworth_
603,A PASTORAL POEM,are found fragments which the poet intended for _Michael_ and which
604,A PASTORAL POEM,were recovered from Dorothy Wordsworth's manuscript book.  Among these
605,A PASTORAL POEM,"are the following lines, which as Professor Dowden suggests, are given"
606,A PASTORAL POEM,"as Wordsworth's answer to the question, ""What feeling for external"
607,A PASTORAL POEM,"nature had such a man as Michael?""  The lines, which correspond to"
608,A PASTORAL POEM,"lines 62-77 of the poem, are as follows;"
609,A PASTORAL POEM,
610,A PASTORAL POEM,"""No doubt if you in terms direct had asked"
611,A PASTORAL POEM,"Whether beloved the mountains, true it is"
612,A PASTORAL POEM,That with blunt repetition of your words
613,A PASTORAL POEM,"He might have stared at you, and said that they"
614,A PASTORAL POEM,"Were frightful to behold, but had you then"
615,A PASTORAL POEM,Discoursed with him . . . . . . . .
616,A PASTORAL POEM,Of his own business and the goings on
617,A PASTORAL POEM,"Of earth and sky, then truly had you seen"

626,A PASTORAL POEM,"of a heart unequally divided."""
627,A PASTORAL POEM,
628,A PASTORAL POEM,48. THE MEANING OF ALL WINDS.  This is not a figurative Statement.
629,A PASTORAL POEM,Michael knows by experience whether the sound and direction of the wind
630,A PASTORAL POEM,"forebode storm or fair weather,--precisely the practical kind of"
631,A PASTORAL POEM,knowledge which a herdsman should possess.
632,A PASTORAL POEM,
633,A PASTORAL POEM,51. SUBTERRANEOUS.  The meaning of this word has given rise to
634,A PASTORAL POEM,"discussion.  ""Subterraneous"" cannot here be literally employed, unless"
635,A PASTORAL POEM,"it refer to the sound of the wind in hollow places, and beneath"
636,A PASTORAL POEM,overhanging crags.
637,A PASTORAL POEM,
638,A PASTORAL POEM,"51-52. LIKE THE NOISE, etc.  Is there a special appropriateness in the"
639,A PASTORAL POEM,use of a Scottish simile?  What is the general character of the similes
640,A PASTORAL POEM,throughout the poem?
641,A PASTORAL POEM,
642,A PASTORAL POEM,56-77. Wordsworth never attributes to Michael the subtler and more
643,A PASTORAL POEM,philosophical sensations which he himself derived from nature.  Such
644,A PASTORAL POEM,poems as _The Prelude_ or _The Excursion_ contain many elevated
645,A PASTORAL POEM,"passages on the influence of nature, which would have been exceedingly"
646,A PASTORAL POEM,inappropriate here.

651,A PASTORAL POEM,fact that all the circumstances of their life breathe a spirit of quiet
652,A PASTORAL POEM,cheerfulness.  Surely the light (129-131) was a symbol of cheer.

1029,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,12-14. Human cares are lightened in proportion to our power of
1030,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,sympathising with nature.  The very beatings of our heart acquire a
1031,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,certain grandeur from the fact that they are a process of nature and
1032,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,"linked thus to the general life of things.  It is possible that ""beatings"

1034,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,"and thus have a bearing upon the words ""pain and fear"" in line 13."

1047,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,
1048,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,42-44. The keenness of Wordsworth's sense perceptions was very
1049,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,remarkable.  His susceptibility to impressions of sound is well
1050,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,"illustrated in this passage, which closes (l. 43-46) with a color picture"

1062,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,
1063,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,54-60. The effect of rapid motion is admirably described.  The spinning
1064,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,effect which Wordsworth evidently has in mind we have all noticed in the
1065,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,fields which seem to revolve when viewed from a swiftly moving: train.
1066,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,"However, a skater from the low level of a stream would see only the"
1067,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,fringe of trees sweep past him.  The darkness and the height of the banks
1068,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,would not permit him to see the relatively motionless objects in the
1069,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,distance in either hand.
1070,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,
1071,INFLUENCE OF NATURAL OBJECTS,57-58. This method of stopping short upon one's heels might prove

1343,PAINTED BY SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT.,
1344,PAINTED BY SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT.,35-36. A POWER IS GONE--SOUL.  The reference is to the death at sea of
1345,PAINTED BY SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT.,his brother Captain John Wordsworth.  The poet can no longer see things
1346,PAINTED BY SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT.,"wholly idealized.  His brother's death has revealed to him, however, the"
1347,PAINTED BY SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT.,ennobling virtue of grief.  Thus a personal loss is converted into human

1577,OENONE,"Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris,"
1578,OENONE,"Leading a jet-black goat white-horn'd, white-hooved,      50"
1579,OENONE,Came up from reedy Simols all alone.
1580,OENONE,
1581,OENONE,"""O mother Ida, harken ere I die."
1582,OENONE,Far-off the torrent call'd me from the cleft:
1583,OENONE,Far up the solitary morning smote
1584,OENONE,The streaks of virgin snow.  With down-dropt eyes         55
1585,OENONE,I sat alone: white-breasted like a star
1586,OENONE,Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard skin
1587,OENONE,"Droop'd from his shoulder, but his sunny hair"
1588,OENONE,Cluster'd about his temples like a God's;
1589,OENONE,And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens        60
1590,OENONE,"When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart"
1591,OENONE,Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came.
1592,OENONE,
1593,OENONE,"""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die."
1594,OENONE,"He smiled, and opening out his milk-white palm"
1595,OENONE,"Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold,                 65"
1596,OENONE,"That smelt ambrosially, and while I look'd"
1597,OENONE,"And listen'd, the full-flowing river of speech"
1598,OENONE,Came down upon my heart.
1599,OENONE,"""'My own Oenone,"
1600,OENONE,"Beautiful-brow'd Oenone, my own soul,"
1601,OENONE,"Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n           70"
1602,OENONE,"""For the most fair,"" would seem to award it thine"
1603,OENONE,As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt
1604,OENONE,"The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace"
1605,OENONE,"Of movement, and the charm of married brows."
1606,OENONE,
1607,OENONE,"""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.                       75"
1608,OENONE,"He prest the blossom of his lips to mine,"
1609,OENONE,"And added 'This was cast upon the board,"
1610,OENONE,When all the full-faced presence of the Gods
1611,OENONE,Ranged in the halls of Peleus; whereupon
1612,OENONE,"Rose feud, with question unto whom 'twere due:            80"
1613,OENONE,"But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve,"
1614,OENONE,"Delivering that to me, by common voice"
1615,OENONE,"Elected umpire, Herè comes to-day,"
1616,OENONE,"Pallas and Aphroditè, claiming each"
1617,OENONE,"This meed of fairest.  Thou, within the cave              85"
1618,OENONE,"Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine,"
1619,OENONE,"Mayst well behold them unbeheld, unheard"
1620,OENONE,"Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods.'"
1621,OENONE,
1622,OENONE,"""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die."
1623,OENONE,It was the deep mid-noon: one silvery cloud               90
1624,OENONE,Had lost his way between the piney sides
1625,OENONE,"Of this long glen.  Then to the bower they came,"
1626,OENONE,"Naked they came to that smooth-swarded bower,"
1627,OENONE,"And at their feet the crocus brake like fire,"
1628,OENONE,"Violet, amaracus, and asphodel,                           95"
1629,OENONE,"Lotos and lilies: and a wind arose,"
1630,OENONE,"And overhead the wandering ivy and vine,"
1631,OENONE,"This way and that, in many a wild festoon"
1632,OENONE,"Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs"
1633,OENONE,With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'.         100
1634,OENONE,
1635,OENONE,"""O mother Ida, harken ere I die."
1636,OENONE,"On the tree-tops a crested peacock lit,"
1637,OENONE,"And o'er him flow'd a golden cloud, and lean'd"
1638,OENONE,"Upon him, slowly dropping fragrant dew."
1639,OENONE,"Then first I heard the voice other, to whom              105"
1640,OENONE,"Coming thro' Heaven, like a light that grows"
1641,OENONE,"Larger and clearer, with one mind the Gods"
1642,OENONE,Rise up for reverence.  She to Paris made
1643,OENONE,"Proffer of royal power, ample rule"
1644,OENONE,"Unquestion'd, overflowing revenue                        110"
1645,OENONE,"Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale"
1646,OENONE,"And river-sunder'd champaign cloth'd with corn,"
1647,OENONE,Or labour'd mines undrainable of ore.
1648,OENONE,"Honour,' she said, 'and homage, tax and toll,"
1649,OENONE,"From many an inland town and haven large,                115"
1650,OENONE,Mast-throng'd beneath her shadowing citadel
1651,OENONE,In glassy bays among her tallest towers.'
1652,OENONE,
1653,OENONE,"""O mother Ida, harken ere I die."
1654,OENONE,"Still she spake on and still she spake of power,"
1655,OENONE,'Which in all action is the end of all;                  120
1656,OENONE,Power fitted to the season; wisdom-bred
1657,OENONE,And throned of wisdom--from all neighbour crowns
1658,OENONE,"Alliance and allegiance, till thy hand"
1659,OENONE,"Fail from the sceptre-staff.  Such boon from me,"
1660,OENONE,"From me, Heaven's Queen, Paris, to thee king-born,       125"
1661,OENONE,"A shepherd all thy life but yet king-born,"
1662,OENONE,"Should come most welcome, seeing men, in power"
1663,OENONE,"Only, are likest gods, who have attain'd"
1664,OENONE,Rest in a happy place and quiet seats
1665,OENONE,"Above the thunder, with undying bliss                    130"
1666,OENONE,In knowledge of their own supremacy.'
1667,OENONE,
1668,OENONE,"""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die."
1669,OENONE,"She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit"
1670,OENONE,"Out at arm's-length, so much the thought of power"
1671,OENONE,Flatter'd his spirit; but Pallas where she stood         135
1672,OENONE,"Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs"
1673,OENONE,O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear
1674,OENONE,"Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold,"
1675,OENONE,"The while, above, her full and earnest eye"
1676,OENONE,Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek                 140
1677,OENONE,"Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply."
1678,OENONE,
1679,OENONE,"""'Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control;"
1680,OENONE,These three alone lead life to sovereign power.
1681,OENONE,"Yet not for power, (power of herself"
1682,OENONE,"Would come uncall'd for) but to live by law,             145"
1683,OENONE,Acting the law we live by without fear;
1684,OENONE,"And, because right is right, to follow right"
1685,OENONE,Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.'
1686,OENONE,
1687,OENONE,"""Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die."
1688,OENONE,Again she said: 'I woo thee not with gifts.              150
1689,OENONE,Sequel of guerdon could not alter me
1690,OENONE,"To fairer.  Judge thou me by what I am,"
1691,OENONE,So shalt thou find me fairest.
1692,OENONE,"Yet, indeed,"
1693,OENONE,If gazing on divinity disrobed
1694,OENONE,"Thy mortal eyes are frail to judge of fair,              155"
1695,OENONE,"Unbias'd by self-profit, oh! rest thee sure"
1696,OENONE,"That I shall love thee well and cleave to thee,"
1697,OENONE,"So that my vigour, wedded to thy blood,"
1698,OENONE,"Shall strike within thy pulses, like a God's,"
1699,OENONE,"To push thee forward thro' a life of shocks,             160"
1700,OENONE,"Dangers, and deeds, until endurance grow"
1701,OENONE,"Sinew'd with action, and the full-grown will,"

1704,OENONE,
1705,OENONE,"""Here she ceas'd,"
1706,OENONE,"And Paris ponder'd, and I cried, 'O Paris,               165"
1707,OENONE,"Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not,"
1708,OENONE,"Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me!"

1713,OENONE,"Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian wells,"
1714,OENONE,With rosy slender fingers backward drew
1715,OENONE,From her warm brows and bosom her deep hair
1716,OENONE,"Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat"
1717,OENONE,And shoulder: from the violets her light foot            175
1718,OENONE,"Shone rosy-white, and o'er her rounded form"
1719,OENONE,Between the shadows of the vine-bunches

1723,OENONE,"She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes,                180"
1724,OENONE,"The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh"
1725,OENONE,"Half-whisper'd in his ear, 'I promise thee"
1726,OENONE,The fairest and most loving wife in Greece.'
1727,OENONE,She spoke and laugh'd: I shut my sight for fear:
1728,OENONE,"But when I look'd, Paris had raised his arm,             185"
1729,OENONE,"And I beheld great Herè's angry eyes,"
1730,OENONE,"As she withdrew into the golden cloud,"
1731,OENONE,And I was left alone within the bower;
1732,OENONE,"And from that time to this I am alone,"
1733,OENONE,And I shall be alone until I die.                        190
1734,OENONE,
1735,OENONE,"""Yet, mother Ida, harken ere I die."
1736,OENONE,Fairest---why fairest wife? am I not fair?
1737,OENONE,My love hath told me so a thousand times;
1738,OENONE,"Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday,"
1739,OENONE,"When I past by, a wild and wanton pard,                  195"
1740,OENONE,"Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail"
1741,OENONE,Crouch'd fawning in the weed.  Most loving is she?
1742,OENONE,"Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms"
1743,OENONE,"Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest"
1744,OENONE,"Close, close to thine in that quick-falling dew          200"
1745,OENONE,"Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains"
1746,OENONE,Flash in the pools of whirling Simois.
1747,OENONE,
1748,OENONE,"""O mother, hear me yet before I die."
1749,OENONE,"They came, they cut away my tallest pines,"
1750,OENONE,"My dark tall pines, that plumed the craggy ledge         205"
1751,OENONE,"High over the blue gorge, and all between"
1752,OENONE,The snowy peak and snow-white cataract
1753,OENONE,Foster'd the callow eaglet--from beneath
1754,OENONE,Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn
1755,OENONE,"The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat               210"

1764,OENONE,"Among the fragments tumbled from the glens,"
1765,OENONE,"Or the dry thickets, I could meet with her,"
1766,OENONE,"The Abominable, that uninvited came                      220"
1767,OENONE,"Into the fair Peleian banquet-hall,"
1768,OENONE,"And cast the golden fruit upon the board,"
1769,OENONE,"And bred this change; that I might speak my mind,"
1770,OENONE,And tell her to her face how much I hate
1771,OENONE,"Her presence, hated both of Gods and men.                225"
1772,OENONE,
1773,OENONE,"""O mother, hear me yet before I die."
1774,OENONE,"Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times,"
1775,OENONE,"In this green valley, under this green hill,"
1776,OENONE,"Ev'n on this hand, and sitting on this stone?"
1777,OENONE,Seal'd it with kisses? water'd it with tears?            230

1783,OENONE,"Pass by the happy souls, that love to live:"
1784,OENONE,"I pray thee, pass before my light of life,"
1785,OENONE,"And shadow all my soul, that I may die."
1786,OENONE,"Thou weighest heavy on the heart within,"
1787,OENONE,Weigh heavy on my eyelids: let me die.                   240

1793,OENONE,"Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills,         245"
1794,OENONE,Like footsteps upon wool.  I dimly see
1795,OENONE,"My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother"
1796,OENONE,Conjectures of the features of her child
1797,OENONE,Ere it is born: her child!--a shudder comes
1798,OENONE,"Across me: never child be born of me,                    250"
1799,OENONE,"Unblest, to vex me with his father's eyes!"

1801,OENONE,"""O mother, hear me yet before I die."
1802,OENONE,"Hear me, O earth.  I will not die alone,"

1804,OENONE,Walking the cold and starless road of Death              255
1805,OENONE,"Uncomforted, leaving my ancient love"
1806,OENONE,With the Greek woman.  I will rise and go
1807,OENONE,"Down into Troy, and ere the stars come forth"
1808,OENONE,"Talk with the wild Cassandra, for she says"
1809,OENONE,"A fire dances before her, and a sound                    260"

1902,MORTE D'ARTHUR,I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm                     25
1903,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That without help I cannot last till morn.
1904,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,"
1905,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how
1906,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"In those old days, one summer noon, an arm"
1907,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,                   30"
1908,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
1909,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Holding the sword--and how I row'd across
1910,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And took it, and have worn it, like a king:"
1911,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And, wheresoever I am sung or told"
1912,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"In aftertime, this also shall be known:                   35"
1913,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But now delay not: take Excalibur,"
1914,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And fling him far into the middle mere:
1915,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Watch what thou seest, and lightly being me word.'"
1916,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
1917,MORTE D'ARTHUR,To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:
1918,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,            40"
1919,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm."
1920,MORTE D'ARTHUR,A little thing may harm a wounded man.
1921,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,"
1922,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.'"
1923,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
1924,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept                45"
1925,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,"
1926,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,"
1927,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang"
1928,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam.  He, stepping down"
1929,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"By zig-zag paths and juts of pointed rock,                50"
1930,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Came on the shining levels of the lake.
1931,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
1932,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,"
1933,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,"
1934,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth"
1935,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:             55
1936,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,"
1937,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Myriads of topaz-lights and jacinth-work
1938,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Of subtlest jewellery.  He gazed so long
1939,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,"
1940,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"This way and that dividing the swift mind,                60"
1941,MORTE D'ARTHUR,In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd
1942,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd
1943,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"There in the many-knotted waterflags,"
1944,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.
1945,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So strode he back slow to the wounded King                65
1946,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
1947,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
1948,MORTE D'ARTHUR,'Hast thou performed my mission which I gave?
1949,MORTE D'ARTHUR,What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'
1950,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
1951,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
1952,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,                 70"
1953,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And the wild water lapping on the crag.'
1954,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
1955,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:"
1956,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,"
1957,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd"
1958,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:                      75"
1959,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For surer sign had follow'd, either hand,"
1960,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Or voice, or else a motion of the mere."
1961,MORTE D'ARTHUR,This is a shameful thing for men to lie.
1962,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again"
1963,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing               80"
1964,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I bad thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.'"
1965,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
1966,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Then went Sir Bedivere the second time
1967,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,"
1968,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought;"
1969,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,                   85"
1970,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"How curiously and strangely chased, he smote"
1971,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"His palms together, and he cried aloud,"
1972,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
1973,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'And if indeed I cast the brand away,"
1974,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,"
1975,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,              90"
1976,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.
1977,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"What good should follow this, if this were done?"
1978,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,"
1979,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.
1980,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Were it well to obey then, if a king demand               95"
1981,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"An act unprofitable, against himself?"
1982,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"The King is sick, and knows not what he does."
1983,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"What record, or what relic of my lord"
1984,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Should be to aftertime, but empty breath"
1985,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,              100"
1986,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,"
1987,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Some one might show it at a joust of arms,"
1988,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Saying, ""King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,"
1989,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.
1990,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps          105"
1991,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Upon the hidden bases of the hills."""
1992,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So might some old man speak in the after-time
1993,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"To all the people, winning reverence."
1994,MORTE D'ARTHUR,But now much honour and much fame were lost.'
1995,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
1996,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,               110"
1997,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And hid Excalibur the second time,"
1998,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And so strode back slow to the wounded King.
1999,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2000,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:"
2001,MORTE D'ARTHUR,'What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'
2002,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2003,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:                   115
2004,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'I heard the water lapping on the crag,"
2005,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And the long ripple washing in the reeds.'
2006,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2007,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:"
2008,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,"
2009,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Unknightly, traitor-hearted!  Woe is me!                 120"
2010,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Authority forgets a dying king,"
2011,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Laid widow'd of the power in his eye
2012,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That bow'd the will.  I see thee what thou art,"
2013,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,"
2014,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"In whom should meet the offices of all,                  125"
2015,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;
2016,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Either from lust of gold, or like a girl"
2017,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.
2018,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,"
2019,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:          130"
2020,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,"
2021,MORTE D'ARTHUR,I will arise and slay thee with my hands.'
2022,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2023,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,"
2024,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged"
2025,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword,          135"
2026,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And strongly wheel'd and threw it.  The great brand
2027,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,"
2028,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,"
2029,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,"
2030,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Seen where the moving isles of winter shock              140
2031,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"By night, with noises of the northern sea."
2032,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:
2033,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm"
2034,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
2035,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him           145"
2036,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Three times, and drew him under in the mere."
2037,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And lightly went the other to the King.
2038,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2039,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then spoke King-Arthur, drawing thicker breath:"
2040,MORTE D'ARTHUR,'Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.
2041,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Speak out: what is it thou has heard, or seen?'          150"
2042,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2043,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
2044,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems"
2045,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,"
2046,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,"
2047,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men,               155"
2048,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So great a miracle as yonder hilt.
2049,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;"
2050,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But when I look'd again, behold an arm,"
2051,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,"
2052,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him          160"
2053,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Three times, and drew him under in the mere.'"
2054,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2055,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:"
2056,MORTE D'ARTHUR,'My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.
2057,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,"
2058,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And bear me to the margin; yet I fear                    165
2059,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.'"
2060,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2061,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"So saying, from the pavement he half rose,"
2062,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,"
2063,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
2064,MORTE D'ARTHUR,As in a picture.  Him Sir Bedivere                       170
2065,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears,"
2066,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And would have spoken, but he found not words,"
2067,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,"
2068,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,"
2069,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.            175
2070,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2071,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,"
2072,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
2073,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"When all the house is mute.  So sigh'd the King,"
2074,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Muttering and murmuring at his ear, 'Quick, quick!"
2075,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I fear it is too late, and I shall die.'                 180"
2076,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2077,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,"
2078,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd,"
2079,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Larger than human on the frozen hills.
2080,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"He heard the deep behind him, and a cry"
2081,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Before.  His own thought drove him like a goad.          185
2082,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves
2083,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And barren chasms, and all to left and right"
2084,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based"
2085,MORTE D'ARTHUR,His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang
2086,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels--             190
2087,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,"
2088,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And the long glories of the winter moon.
2089,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2090,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,"
2091,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,"
2092,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Beneath them; and descending they were ware              195
2093,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That all the decks were dense with stately forms
2094,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these"
2095,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Three Queens with crowns of gold--and from them rose
2096,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,"
2097,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And, as it were one voice an agony                       200"
2098,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills"
2099,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"All night in a waste land, where no one comes,"
2100,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Or hath come, since the making of the world,"
2101,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then murmur'd Arthur, 'Place me in the barge.'"
2102,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And to the barge they came.  There those three Queens    205
2103,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept."
2104,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"But she, that rose the tallest of them all"
2105,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,"
2106,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands,"
2107,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And call'd him by his name, complaining loud,            210"
2108,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And dropping bitter tears against his brow
2109,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white
2110,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And colourless, and like the wither'd moon"
2111,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;
2112,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops        215
2113,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--
2114,MORTE D'ARTHUR,That made his forehead like a rising sun
2115,MORTE D'ARTHUR,High from the daïs-throne--were parch'd with dust;
2116,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,"
2117,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.    220
2118,MORTE D'ARTHUR,So like a shatter'd column lay the King;
2119,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,"
2120,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"From spur to plume a star of tournament,"
2121,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged"
2122,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.                  225
2123,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2124,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere,"
2125,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?"
2126,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?
2127,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For now I see the true old times are dead,"
2128,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"When every morning brought a noble chance,               230"
2129,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And every chance brought out a noble knight.
2130,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Such times have been not since the light that led
2131,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.
2132,MORTE D'ARTHUR,But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved
2133,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Which was an image of the mighty world;                  235
2134,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And I, the last, go forth companionless,"
2135,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And the days darken round me, and the years,"
2136,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Among new men, strange faces, other minds.'"
2137,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2138,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:
2139,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'The old order changeth, yielding place to new,          240"
2140,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And God fulfils Himself in many ways,"
2141,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
2142,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?
2143,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I have lived my life, and that which I have done"
2144,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"May He within Himself make pure! but thou,               245"
2145,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"If thou shouldst never see my face again,"
2146,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Pray for my soul.  More things are wrought by prayer
2147,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Than this world dreams of.  Wherefore, let thy voice"
2148,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Rise like a fountain for me night and day.
2149,MORTE D'ARTHUR,For what are men better than sheep or goats              250
2150,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That nourish a blind life within the brain,"
2151,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer"
2152,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Both for themselves and those who call them friend?
2153,MORTE D'ARTHUR,For so the whole round earth is every way
2154,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.              255
2155,MORTE D'ARTHUR,But now farewell.  I am going a long way
2156,MORTE D'ARTHUR,With these thou seest--if indeed I go--
2157,MORTE D'ARTHUR,(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)
2158,MORTE D'ARTHUR,To the island-valley of Avilion;
2159,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,              260"
2160,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
2161,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns"
2162,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea,"
2163,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.'
2164,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2165,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"So said he, and the barge with oar and sail              265"
2166,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan"
2167,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,"
2168,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood"
2169,MORTE D'ARTHUR,With swarthy webs.  Long stood Sir Bedivere
2170,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Revolving many memories, till the hull                   270"
2171,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn,"
2172,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And on the mere the wailing died away.
2173,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2174,MORTE D'ARTHUR,*      *      *      *      *      *
2175,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
2176,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Here ended Hall, and our last light, that long"
2177,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Had wink'd and threatened darkness, flared and fell:"
2178,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"At which the Parson, sent to sleep with sound,"
2179,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And waked with silence, grunted 'Good!' but we            55"
2180,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Sat rapt: it was the tone with which he read--
2181,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Perhaps some modern touches here and there
2182,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Redeem'd it from the charge of nothingness--
2183,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Or else we loved the man, and prized his work;"
2184,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I know not: but we sitting, as I said,                    60"
2185,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The cock crew loud; as at that time of year
2186,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The lusty bird takes every hour for dawn:
2187,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then Francis, muttering, like a man ill-used,"

2226,THE BROOK,"When all the wood stands in a mist of green,"

2228,THE BROOK,"For which, in branding summers of Bengal,"
2229,THE BROOK,Or ev'n the sweet half-English Neilgherry air

2239,THE BROOK,To bicker down a valley.
2240,THE BROOK,
2241,THE BROOK,"By thirty hills I hurry down,"

2254,THE BROOK,Stands Philip's farm where brook and river meet.
2255,THE BROOK,
2256,THE BROOK,"I chatter over stony ways,"
2257,THE BROOK,"In little sharps and trebles,                      40"
2258,THE BROOK,"I bubble into eddying bays,"
2259,THE BROOK,I babble on the pebbles.
2260,THE BROOK,
2261,THE BROOK,With many a curve my banks I fret
2262,THE BROOK,"By many a field and fallow,"
2263,THE BROOK,And many a fairy foreland set                        45
2264,THE BROOK,With willow-weed and mallow.
2265,THE BROOK,
2266,THE BROOK,"I chatter, chatter, as I flow"

2271,THE BROOK,'But Philip chattered more than brook or bird;

2283,THE BROOK,With many a silvery waterbreak

2301,THE BROOK,"James Willows, of one name and heart with her."
2302,THE BROOK,"For here I came, twenty years back--the week"
2303,THE BROOK,Before I parted with poor Edmund; crost
2304,THE BROOK,"By that old bridge which, half in ruins then,"
2305,THE BROOK,Still makes a hoary eyebrow for the gleam               80
2306,THE BROOK,"Beyond it, where the waters marry--crost,"
2307,THE BROOK,"Whistling a random bar of Bonny Doon,"
2308,THE BROOK,"And push'd at Philip's garden-gate.  The gate,"
2309,THE BROOK,"Half-parted from a weak and scolding hinge,"
2310,THE BROOK,"Stuck; and he clamour'd from a casement, ""Run""        85"
2311,THE BROOK,"To Katie somewhere in the walks below,"
2312,THE BROOK,"""Run, Katie!""  Katie never ran: she moved"
2313,THE BROOK,"To meet me, winding under woodbine bowers,"
2314,THE BROOK,"A little flutter'd, with her eyelids down,"
2315,THE BROOK,"Fresh apple-blossom, blushing for a boon.               90"
2316,THE BROOK,
2317,THE BROOK,'What was it? less of sentiment than sense
2318,THE BROOK,Had Katie; not illiterate; nor of those
2319,THE BROOK,"Who dabbling in the fount of fictive tears,"
2320,THE BROOK,"And nursed by mealy-mouth'd philanthropies,"
2321,THE BROOK,Divorce the Feeling from her mate the Deed.           95
2322,THE BROOK,'She told me.  She and James had quarrell'd.  Why?
2323,THE BROOK,"What cause of quarrel?  None, she said, no cause;"
2324,THE BROOK,"James had no cause: but when I prest the cause,"
2325,THE BROOK,I learnt that James had flickering jealousies
2326,THE BROOK,Which anger'd her.  Who anger'd James?  I said.        100
2327,THE BROOK,"But Katie snatch'd her eyes at once from mine,"
2328,THE BROOK,And sketching with her slender pointed foot
2329,THE BROOK,Some figure like a wizard pentagram
2330,THE BROOK,"On garden gravel, let my query pass"
2331,THE BROOK,"Unclaimed, in flushing silence, till I ask'd           105"
2332,THE BROOK,"If James were coming.  ""Coming every day,"""
2333,THE BROOK,"She answer'd, ""ever longing to explain,"

2336,THE BROOK,"And James departed vext with him and her.""               110"
2337,THE BROOK,"How could I help her?  ""Would I--was it wrong?"""
2338,THE BROOK,(Claspt hands and that petitionary grace
2339,THE BROOK,Of sweet seventeen subdued me ere she spoke)
2340,THE BROOK,"""O would I take her father for one hour,"
2341,THE BROOK,"For one half-hour, and let him talk to me!""            115"
2342,THE BROOK,"And even while she spoke, I saw where James"
2343,THE BROOK,"Made toward us, like a wader in the surf,"
2344,THE BROOK,"Beyond the brook, waist-deep in meadow-sweet."
2345,THE BROOK,
2346,THE BROOK,"'O Katie, what I suffer'd for your sake!"
2347,THE BROOK,"For in I went, and call'd old Philip out               120"
2348,THE BROOK,To show the farm: full willingly he rose:
2349,THE BROOK,He led me thro' the short sweet-smelling lanes
2350,THE BROOK,"Of his wheat-suburb, babbling as he went,"
2351,THE BROOK,"He praised his land, his horses, his machines;"
2352,THE BROOK,"He praised his ploughs, his cows, his hogs, his dogs;   125"
2353,THE BROOK,"He praised his hens, his geese, his guinea-hens,"
2354,THE BROOK,"His pigeons, who in session on their roofs"
2355,THE BROOK,"Approved him, bowing at their own deserts:"
2356,THE BROOK,Then from the plaintive mother's teat he took
2357,THE BROOK,"Her blind and shuddering puppies, naming each,          130"
2358,THE BROOK,"And naming those, his friends, for whom they were:"
2359,THE BROOK,Then crost the common into Darnley chase
2360,THE BROOK,To show Sir Arthur's deer.  In copse and fern
2361,THE BROOK,Twinkled the innumerable ear and tail.
2362,THE BROOK,"Then, seated on a serpent-rooted beech,                135"
2363,THE BROOK,"He pointed out a pasturing colt, and said:"
2364,THE BROOK,"""That was the four-year-old I sold the Squire."""
2365,THE BROOK,And there he told a long long-winded tale
2366,THE BROOK,"Of how the Squire had seen the colt at grass,"
2367,THE BROOK,"And how it was the thing his daughter wish'd,           140"
2368,THE BROOK,And how he sent the bailiff to the farm
2369,THE BROOK,"To learn the price, and what the price he ask'd,"
2370,THE BROOK,"And how the bailiff swore that he was mad,"
2371,THE BROOK,But he stood firm; and so the matter hung;
2372,THE BROOK,He gave them line; and five days after that              145
2373,THE BROOK,"He met the bailiff at the Golden Fleece,"
2374,THE BROOK,"Who then and there had offer'd something more,"
2375,THE BROOK,But he stood firm; and so the matter hung;
2376,THE BROOK,He knew the man; the colt would fetch its price;
2377,THE BROOK,He gave them line: and how by chance at last             150
2378,THE BROOK,"(It might be May or April, he forgot,"
2379,THE BROOK,The last of April or the first of May)
2380,THE BROOK,"He found the bailiff riding by the farm,"
2381,THE BROOK,"And, talking from the point, he drew him in,"
2382,THE BROOK,"And there he mellow'd all his heart with ale,           155"
2383,THE BROOK,"Until they closed a bargain, hand in hand."
2384,THE BROOK,
2385,THE BROOK,"'Then, while I breathed in sight of haven, he,"
2386,THE BROOK,"Poor fellow, could he help it? recommenced,"
2387,THE BROOK,"And ran thro' all the coltish chronicle,"
2388,THE BROOK,"Wild Will, Black Bess, Tantivy, Tallyho,                 160"
2389,THE BROOK,"Reform, White Rose, Bellerophon, the Jilt,"
2390,THE BROOK,"Arbaces, and Phenomenon, and the rest,"
2391,THE BROOK,"Tilt, not to die a listener, I arose,"
2392,THE BROOK,"And with me Philip, talking still; and so"
2393,THE BROOK,"We turn'd our foreheads from the falling sun,          165"
2394,THE BROOK,And following our own shadows thrice as long
2395,THE BROOK,"As when they follow'd us from Philip's door,"
2396,THE BROOK,"Arrived, and found the sun of sweet content"
2397,THE BROOK,"Re-risen in Katie's eyes, and all thing's well."
2398,THE BROOK,
2399,THE BROOK,"I steal by lawns and grassy plots,                 170"
2400,THE BROOK,I slide by hazel covers;
2401,THE BROOK,I move the sweet forget-me-nots
2402,THE BROOK,That grow for happy lovers.
2403,THE BROOK,
2404,THE BROOK,"I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,"
2405,THE BROOK,Among my skimming swallows;                        175
2406,THE BROOK,I make the netted sunbeam dance
2407,THE BROOK,Against my sandy shallows.
2408,THE BROOK,
2409,THE BROOK,I murmur under moon and stars
2410,THE BROOK,In brambly wildernesses;
2411,THE BROOK,I linger by my shingly bars;                        180
2412,THE BROOK,I loiter round my cresses;
2413,THE BROOK,
2414,THE BROOK,And out again I curve and flow
2415,THE BROOK,"To join the brimming river,"
2416,THE BROOK,"For men may come and men may go,"
2417,THE BROOK,But I go on for ever.                             185
2418,THE BROOK,
2419,THE BROOK,"Yes, men may come and go; and these are gone,"
2420,THE BROOK,"All gone.  My dearest brother, Edmund, sleeps,"
2421,THE BROOK,"Not by the well-known stream and rustic spire,"
2422,THE BROOK,"But unfamiliar Arno, and the dome"
2423,THE BROOK,"Of Brunelleschi; sleeps in peace: and he,            190"
2424,THE BROOK,"Poor Philip, of all his lavish waste of words"
2425,THE BROOK,Remains the lean P. W. on his tomb:
2426,THE BROOK,I scraped the lichen from it: Katie walks
2427,THE BROOK,By the long wash of Australasian seas
2428,THE BROOK,"Far off, and holds her head to other stars,           195"
2429,THE BROOK,And breathes in April autumns.  All are gone.'
2430,THE BROOK,
2431,THE BROOK,"So Lawrence Aylmer, seated on a stile"
2432,THE BROOK,"In the long hedge, and rolling in his mind"
2433,THE BROOK,"Old waifs of rhyme, and bowing o'er the brook"
2434,THE BROOK,"A tonsured head in middle age forlorn,                200"
2435,THE BROOK,Mused and was mute.  On a sudden a low breath
2436,THE BROOK,Offender air made tremble in the hedge
2437,THE BROOK,The fragile bindweed-bells and briony rings;
2438,THE BROOK,"And he look'd up.  There stood a maiden near,"
2439,THE BROOK,Waiting to pass.  In much amaze he stared              205
2440,THE BROOK,"On eyes a bashful azure, and on hair"
2441,THE BROOK,"In gloss and hue the chestnut, when the shell"
2442,THE BROOK,Divides threefold to show the fruit within:
2443,THE BROOK,"Then, wondering, ask'd her 'Are you from the farm?'"
2444,THE BROOK,'Yes' answer'd she.  'Pray stay a little: pardon me;     210
2445,THE BROOK,What do they call you?'  'Katie.'  'That were strange.
2446,THE BROOK,What surname?'  'Willows.'  'No!'  'That is my name.'
2447,THE BROOK,"'Indeed!' and here he look'd so self-perplext,"
2448,THE BROOK,"That Katie laugh'd, and laughing blush'd, till he"
2449,THE BROOK,"Laugh'd also, but as one before he wakes,               215"
2450,THE BROOK,Who feels a glimmering strangeness in his dream;
2451,THE BROOK,"Then looking at her; 'Too happy, fresh and fair,"
2452,THE BROOK,"Too fresh and fair in our sad world's best bloom,"
2453,THE BROOK,To be the ghost of one who bore your name
2454,THE BROOK,"About these meadows, twenty years ago.               220"
2455,THE BROOK,
2456,THE BROOK,"'Have you not heard?' said Katie, 'we came back."
2457,THE BROOK,We bought the farm we tenanted before.
2458,THE BROOK,Am I so like her? so they said on board.
2459,THE BROOK,"Sir, if you knew her in her English days,"
2460,THE BROOK,"My mother, as it seems you did, the days               225"
2461,THE BROOK,"That most she loves to talk of, come with me."

2744,WILLIAM WORDSWORTH,
2745,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH
2746,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
2747,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"William Wordsworth was born at Cockermouth, Cumberland, on April 7th,"
2748,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"1770.  His father, John Wordsworth, was the agent of Sir J. Lowther,"
2749,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,who later became the first Earl of Lonsdale.  At the age of eight the
2750,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,boy was sent to school at Hawkshead.  The impressions of his boyhood
2751,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"period are related in the autobiographical poem, _The Prelude_,"
2752,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"(written 1805, published 1850), and from this poetical record we"
2753,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,discern how strong the influences of Nature were to shape and develop
2754,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"his imagination.  Wordsworth's father died in 1783, leaving the family"
2755,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,poorly provided for.  The main asset was a considerable claim upon the
2756,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Earl of Lonsdale, which that individual refused to pay.  On his death,"
2757,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"in 1802, the successor to the title and estates paid the amount of the"
2758,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"claim in full with accumulated interest.  In the interval, however, the"
2759,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Wordsworth family remained in very straitened circumstances.  Enough
2760,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,money was provided by Wordsworth's guardians to send him to Cambridge
2761,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"University In 1787.  He entered St. John's College, and after an"
2762,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"undistinguished course graduated without honors in January, 1791.  His"
2763,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"vacations were spent chiefly in Hawkshead and Wales, but one memorable"
2764,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,vacation was marked by a walking excursion with a friend through France
2765,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"and Switzerland, the former country then being on the verge of"
2766,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,revolution.
2767,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
2768,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Shortly after leaving the University, in November, 1791, Wordsworth"
2769,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"returned to France, remaining there until December of the following"
2770,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,year.  During this period he was completely won over to the principles
2771,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,of the revolution.  The later reaction from these principles
2772,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,constituted the one moral struggle of his life.
2773,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
2774,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1793 his first work appeared before the public--two poems, entitled"
2775,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"_The Evening Walk_ and _Descriptive Sketches_.  Coleridge, who read"
2776,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"these pieces at Cambridge, divined that they announced the emergence of"
2777,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,an original poetical genius above the horizon.  Readers of the poems
2778,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"to-day, who are wise after the event, could scarcely divine as much."
2779,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,At about this period Wordsworth received a bequest of 900 pounds from
2780,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Raisley Calvert, which enabled him and his sister Dorothy to take a"
2781,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,small cottage at Racedown in Dorsetshire.  Here he wrote a number of
2782,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,poems in which he worked off the ferment of his revolutionary ideas.
2783,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,These ideas can scarcely be said to have troubled him much in later
2784,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,years.
2785,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
2786,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"An important incident in his life, hardly second in importance to the"
2787,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"stimulating companionship of his sister, was his meeting with"
2788,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Coleridge, which occurred probably towards the close of 1795."
2789,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Coleridge, who was but little younger than Wordsworth, had the more"
2790,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"richly equipped, if not the more richly endowed, mind.  He was living"
2791,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"at Nether Stowey, and in order to benefit by the stimulus which such a"
2792,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"friendship offered, the Wordsworth's moved to Alfoxden, three miles"
2793,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"away from Stowey (July, 1797).  It was during a walking expedition to"
2794,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the Quantock Hills in November of that year that the poem of _The
2795,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Ancient Mariner_ was planned.  It was intended that the poem should be
2796,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"a joint production, but Wordsworth's contribution was confined to the"
2797,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"suggestion of a few details merely, and some scattered lines which are"
2798,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,indicated in the notes to that poem.  Their poetic theories were soon
2799,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,to take definite shape in the publication of the famous _Lyrical
2800,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Ballads_ (September, 1798), to which Coleridge contributed _The Ancient"
2801,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Mariner_, and Wordsworth some characteristic lyrical, reflective, and"
2802,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,narrative poems.  The excessive simplicity and alleged triviality of
2803,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,some of these poems long continued to give offence to the conservative
2804,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,lovers of poetry.  Even to-day we feel that Wordsworth was sometimes
2805,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the victim of his own theories.
2806,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
2807,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,In June of this same year (1798) Wordsworth and his sister accompanied
2808,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Coleridge to Germany.  They soon parted company, the Wordsworths"
2809,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"settling at Goslar, while Coleridge, intent upon study, went in search"
2810,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,of German metaphysics at Gottingen.  Wordsworth did not come into any
2811,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"contract with German life or thought, but sat through the winter by a"
2812,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,stove writing poems for a second edition of the _Lyrical Ballads_.
2813,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"April, 1799, found the brother and sister again in England.  In"
2814,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"December they settled down at Dove Cottage, Town End, Grasmere, and"
2815,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"never, save for brief intervals, abandoned the Lake Country.  In 1802,"
2816,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"as has been said, a slight accession of fortune fell to Wordsworth by"
2817,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the settlement of the Lonsdale claim.  The share of each of the family
2818,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"was 1,800 pounds.  On the strength of this wind-fall the poet felt that"
2819,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"he might marry, and accordingly brought home Mary Hutchinson as his"
2820,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,wife.
2821,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
2822,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,The subsequent career of Wordsworth belongs to the history of poetry.
2823,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Of events in the ordinary sense there are few to record.  He
2824,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,successively occupies three houses in the Lake Country after abandoning
2825,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Dove Cottage.  We find him at Allan Bank in 1808, in the Parsonage at"
2826,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Grasmere in 1810, and at Rydal Mount from 1813 to his death in 1850."
2827,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"He makes occasional excursions to Scotland or the Continent, and at"
2828,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"long intervals visits London, where Carlyle sees him and records his"
2829,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,vivid impressions.  For many years Wordsworth enjoys the sinecure of
2830,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Distributor of Stamps for Westmoreland (400 pounds a year), and on his"
2831,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"resignation of that office in his son's favor, he is placed on the"
2832,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Civil List for a well deserved pension of 300 pounds.  On Southey's
2833,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"death, in 1843, he is appointed Poet Laureate.  He died at Grasmere on"
2834,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"April 23rd, 1850."
2835,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
2836,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Wordsworth's principal long poems are: _The Prelude_ (1805 published
2837,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,1850); _The Excursion_ (1814); _The White Doe of Rylstone_ (1815) and
2838,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,_Peter Bell The Waggoner_ (1819).  His fame rests principally on his
2839,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"shorter narrative poems, his meditative lyrics, including his two great"
2840,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"odes, _To Duty_ and _On the Intimations of Immortality_, and on the"
2841,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"sonnets, which rank with the finest in the language.  The longer poems"
2842,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"have many fine passages exhibiting his powers of graphic description,"
2843,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and illustrating his mystical philosophy of nature.
2844,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
2845,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Thomas Carlyle's description of Wordsworth is of interest: ""For the"
2846,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"rest, he talked well in his way; with veracity, easy brevity, and"
2847,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"force, as a wise tradesman would of his tools and workshop, and as no"
2848,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"unwise one could.  His voice was good, frank, and sonorous, though"
2849,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"practically clear, distinct, and forcible, rather than melodious; the"
2850,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"tone of him, businesslike, sedately confident; no discourtesy, yet no"
2851,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"anxiety about being courteous.  A fine wholesome rusticity, fresh as"
2852,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"his mountain breezes, sat well on the stalwart veteran, and on all he"
2853,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"said and did.  You would have said that he was a usually taciturn man,"
2854,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"glad to unlock himself to audience sympathetic and intelligent, when"
2855,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"such offered itself.  His face bore marks of much, not always peaceful,"
2856,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"meditation; the look of it not bland or benevolent so much as close,"
2857,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"impregnable, and hard; a man _multa tacere loquive paratus_, in a world"
2858,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,where he had experienced no lack of contradictions as he strode along.
2859,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"The eyes were not very brilliant, but they had a quiet clearness; there"
2860,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"was enough of brow, and well-shaped; rather too much cheek ('horse"
2861,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"face' I have heard satirists say); face of squarish shape, and"
2862,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"decidedly longish, as I think the head itself was (its length going"
2863,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"horizontal); he was large-boned, lean, but still firm-knit, tall, and"
2864,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"strong-looking when he stood, a right good old steel-gray figure, with"
2865,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"rustic simplicity and dignity about him, and a vivacious strength"
2866,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"looking through him, which might have suited one of those old"
2867,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,steel-gray markgrafs whom Henry the Fowler set up towards the 'marches'
2868,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and do battle with the intrusive heathen in a stalwart and judicious
2869,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"manner."""

2940,APPRECIATIONS,
2941,APPRECIATIONS,"Coleridge, with rare insight, summarized Wordsworth's characteristic"
2942,APPRECIATIONS,defects and merits as follows;
2943,APPRECIATIONS,
2944,APPRECIATIONS,"""The first characteristic, though only occasional defect, which I"
2945,APPRECIATIONS,appear to myself to find in these poems is the inconstancy of the
2946,APPRECIATIONS,style.  Under this name I refer to the sudden and unprepared
2947,APPRECIATIONS,transitions from lines or sentences of peculiar felicity (at all events
2948,APPRECIATIONS,"striking and original) to a style, not only unimpassioned but"
2949,APPRECIATIONS,undistinguished.
2950,APPRECIATIONS,
2951,APPRECIATIONS,"""The second defect I can generalize with tolerable accuracy, if the"
2952,APPRECIATIONS,"reader will pardon an uncouth and newly-coined word.  There is, I"
2953,APPRECIATIONS,"should say, not seldom a _matter-of-factness_ in certain poems.  This"
2954,APPRECIATIONS,"may be divided into, first, a laborious minuteness and fidelity in the"
2955,APPRECIATIONS,"representation of objects, and there positions, as they appeared to the"
2956,APPRECIATIONS,"poet himself; secondly, the insertion of accidental circumstances, in"
2957,APPRECIATIONS,"order to the full explanation of his living characters, their"
2958,APPRECIATIONS,dispositions and actions; which circumstances might be necessary to
2959,APPRECIATIONS,"establish the probability of a statement in real life, when nothing is"
2960,APPRECIATIONS,"taken for granted by the hearer; but appear superfluous in poetry,"
2961,APPRECIATIONS,where the reader is willing to believe for his own sake. . .
2962,APPRECIATIONS,
2963,APPRECIATIONS,"""Third; an undue predilection for the _dramatic_ form in certain poems,"
2964,APPRECIATIONS,from which one or other of two evils result.  Either the thoughts and
2965,APPRECIATIONS,"diction are different from that of the poet, and then there arises an"
2966,APPRECIATIONS,"incongruity of style; or they are the same and indistinguishable, where"
2967,APPRECIATIONS,"two are represented as talking, while in truth one man only speaks. . ."
2968,APPRECIATIONS,
2969,APPRECIATIONS,"""The fourth class of defects is closely connected with the former; but"
2970,APPRECIATIONS,yet are such as arise likewise from an intensity of feeling
2971,APPRECIATIONS,"disproportionate to such knowledge and value of the objects described,"
2972,APPRECIATIONS,"as can be fairly anticipated of men in general, even of the most"
2973,APPRECIATIONS,"cultivated classes; and with which therefore few only, and those few"
2974,APPRECIATIONS,"particularly circumstanced, can be supposed to sympathize: in this"
2975,APPRECIATIONS,"class, I comprise occasional prolixity, repetition, and an eddying,"
2976,APPRECIATIONS,"instead of progression, of thought. . ."
2977,APPRECIATIONS,
2978,APPRECIATIONS,"""Fifth and last; thoughts and images too great for the subject.  This"
2979,APPRECIATIONS,"is an approximation to what might be called mental bombast, as"
2980,APPRECIATIONS,"distinguished from verbal: for, as in the latter there is a"
2981,APPRECIATIONS,"disproportion of the expressions to the thoughts, so in this there is a"
2982,APPRECIATIONS,disproportion of thought to the circumstance and occasion. . .
2983,APPRECIATIONS,
2984,APPRECIATIONS,"""To these defects, which . . . are only occasional, I may oppose . . ."
2985,APPRECIATIONS,the following (for the most part correspondent) excellencies:
2986,APPRECIATIONS,
2987,APPRECIATIONS,"""First; an austere purity of language both grammatically and logically;"
2988,APPRECIATIONS,in short a perfect appropriateness of the words to the meaning. . .
2989,APPRECIATIONS,
2990,APPRECIATIONS,"""The second characteristic excellence of Mr. Wordsworth's works is--a"
2991,APPRECIATIONS,"correspondent weight and sanity of the thoughts and sentiments, won not"
2992,APPRECIATIONS,"from books, but from the poet's own meditative observations.  They are"
2993,APPRECIATIONS,fresh and have the dew upon them. . .
2994,APPRECIATIONS,
2995,APPRECIATIONS,"""Third; . . . the sinewy strength and originality of single lines and"
2996,APPRECIATIONS,paragraphs; the frequent _curiosa felicitas_ of his diction. . .
2997,APPRECIATIONS,
2998,APPRECIATIONS,"""Fourth; the perfect truth of nature in his images and descriptions as"
2999,APPRECIATIONS,"taken immediately from nature, and proving a long and genial intimacy"
3000,APPRECIATIONS,with the very spirit which gives the physiognomic expressions to all
3001,APPRECIATIONS,the works of nature.  Like a green field reflected in a calm and
3002,APPRECIATIONS,"perfectly transparent lake, the image is distinguished from the reality"
3003,APPRECIATIONS,only by its greater softness and lustre.  Like the moisture or the
3004,APPRECIATIONS,"polish on a pebble, genius neither distorts nor false-colors its"
3005,APPRECIATIONS,"objects; but on the contrary, brings out many a vein and many a tint,"
3006,APPRECIATIONS,"which escape the eye of common observation, thus raising to the rank of"
3007,APPRECIATIONS,gems what had been often kicked away by the hurrying foot of the
3008,APPRECIATIONS,traveller on the dusty high-road of custom. . .
3009,APPRECIATIONS,
3010,APPRECIATIONS,"""Fifth; a meditative pathos, a union of deep and subtle thought with"
3011,APPRECIATIONS,sensibility; a sympathy with man as man; the sympathy indeed of a
3012,APPRECIATIONS,"contemplator, rather than a fellow-sufferer or co-mate, but of a"
3013,APPRECIATIONS,"contemplator, from whose view no difference of rank conceals the"
3014,APPRECIATIONS,"sameness of the nature; no injuries of wind or weather, of toil, or"
3015,APPRECIATIONS,"even of ignorance, wholly disguise the human face divine.  The"
3016,APPRECIATIONS,superscription and the image of the Creator still remains legible to
3017,APPRECIATIONS,"_him_ under the dark lines, with which guilt or calamity had cancelled"
3018,APPRECIATIONS,or cross-barred it.  Here the Man and the Poet lose and find themselves
3019,APPRECIATIONS,"in each other, the one as glorified, the latter as substantiated.  In"
3020,APPRECIATIONS,"this mild and philosophic pathos, Wordsworth appears to me without a"
3021,APPRECIATIONS,compeer.  Such as he is; so he writes.
3022,APPRECIATIONS,
3023,APPRECIATIONS,"""Last and pre-eminently, I challenge for this poet the gift of"
3024,APPRECIATIONS,imagination in the highest and strictest sense of the word.  In the
3025,APPRECIATIONS,"play of fancy, Wordsworth, to my feelings, is not always graceful, and"
3026,APPRECIATIONS,"sometimes recondite. . . But in imaginative power, he stands nearest of"
3027,APPRECIATIONS,all writers to Shakespeare and Milton; and yet in a kind perfectly
3028,APPRECIATIONS,"unborrowed and his own."""
3029,APPRECIATIONS,
3030,APPRECIATIONS,These are the grounds upon which Coleridge bases the poetic claims of
3031,APPRECIATIONS,Wordsworth.
3032,APPRECIATIONS,
3033,APPRECIATIONS,"Matthew Arnold, in the preface to his well-known collection of"
3034,APPRECIATIONS,"Wordsworth's poems, accords to the poet a rank no less exalted.  ""I"
3035,APPRECIATIONS,"firmly believe that the poetical performance of Wordsworth is, after"
3036,APPRECIATIONS,"that of Shakespeare and Milton, of which all the world now recognizes"
3037,APPRECIATIONS,"the worth, undoubtedly the most considerable in our language from the"
3038,APPRECIATIONS,"Elizabethan age to the present time.""  His essential greatness is to be"
3039,APPRECIATIONS,"found in his shorter pieces, despite the frequent intrusion of much"
3040,APPRECIATIONS,"that is very inferior.  Still it is ""by the great body of powerful and"
3041,APPRECIATIONS,significant work which remains to him after every reduction and
3042,APPRECIATIONS,"deduction has been made, that Wordsworth's superiority is proved."""
3043,APPRECIATIONS,
3044,APPRECIATIONS,"Coleridge had not dwelt sufficiently, perhaps, upon the joyousness"
3045,APPRECIATIONS,which results from Wordsworth's philosophy of human life and external
3046,APPRECIATIONS,nature.  This Matthew Arnold considers to be the prime source of his
3047,APPRECIATIONS,"greatness.  ""Wordsworth's poetry is great because of the extraordinary"
3048,APPRECIATIONS,power with which Wordsworth feels the joy offered to us in the simple
3049,APPRECIATIONS,primary affections and duties; and because of the extraordinary power
3050,APPRECIATIONS,"with which, in case after case, he shows us this joy, and renders it so"
3051,APPRECIATIONS,"as to make us share it.""  Goethe's poetry, as Wordsworth once said, is"
3052,APPRECIATIONS,"not inevitable enough, is too consciously moulded by the supreme will"
3053,APPRECIATIONS,"of the artist.  ""But Wordsworth's poetry,"" writes Arnold, ""when he is"
3054,APPRECIATIONS,"at his best, is inevitable, as inevitable as Nature herself.  It might"
3055,APPRECIATIONS,"seem that Nature not only gave him the matter for his poem, but wrote"
3056,APPRECIATIONS,"his poem for him.""  The set poetic style of _The Excursion_ is a"
3057,APPRECIATIONS,"failure, but there is something unique and unmatchable in the simple"
3058,APPRECIATIONS,"grace of his narrative poems and lyrics.  ""Nature herself seems, I say,"
3059,APPRECIATIONS,"to take the pen out of his hand, and to write for him with her own"
3060,APPRECIATIONS,"bare, sheer, penetrating power.  This arises from two causes: from the"
3061,APPRECIATIONS,"profound sincereness with which Wordsworth feels his subject, and also"
3062,APPRECIATIONS,from the profoundly sincere and natural character of his subject
3063,APPRECIATIONS,itself.  He can and will treat such a subject with nothing but the most
3064,APPRECIATIONS,"plain, first hand, almost austere naturalness.  His expression may"
3065,APPRECIATIONS,"often be called bald, as, for instance, in the poem of _Resolution and"
3066,APPRECIATIONS,"Independence_; but it is bald as the bare mountain tops are bald, with"
3067,APPRECIATIONS,a baldness which is full of grandeur. . .  Wherever we meet with the
3068,APPRECIATIONS,"successful balance, in Wordsworth, of profound truth of subject with"
3069,APPRECIATIONS,"profound truth of execution, he is unique."""
3070,APPRECIATIONS,
3071,APPRECIATIONS,Professor Dowden has also laid stress upon the harmonious balance of
3072,APPRECIATIONS,"Wordsworth's nature, his different faculties seeming to interpenetrate"
3073,APPRECIATIONS,"one another, and yield mutual support.  He has likewise called"
3074,APPRECIATIONS,attention to the austere naturalism of which Arnold speaks.
3075,APPRECIATIONS,"""Wordsworth was a great naturalist in literature, but he was also a"
3076,APPRECIATIONS,great Idealist; and between the naturalist and the idealist in
3077,APPRECIATIONS,"Wordsworth no opposition existed: each worked with the other, each"
3078,APPRECIATIONS,"served the other.  While Scott, by allying romance with reality, saved"
3079,APPRECIATIONS,romantic fiction from the extravagances and follies into which it had
3080,APPRECIATIONS,"fallen, Wordsworth's special work was to open a higher way for"
3081,APPRECIATIONS,"naturalism in art by its union with ideal truth."""
3082,APPRECIATIONS,
3083,APPRECIATIONS,"Criticism has long since ceased to ridicule his _Betty Foy_, and his"
3084,APPRECIATIONS,"_Harry Gill_, whose ""teeth, they chatter, chatter still.""  Such"
3085,APPRECIATIONS,"malicious sport proved only too easy for Wordsworth's contemporaries,"
3086,APPRECIATIONS,and still the essential value of his poetry was unimpaired.
3087,APPRECIATIONS,
3088,APPRECIATIONS,"The range of poetry is indeed inexhaustible, and even the greatest"
3089,APPRECIATIONS,poets must suffer some subtraction from universal pre-eminence.
3090,APPRECIATIONS,"Therefore we may frankly admit the deficiencies of Wordsworth,--that he"
3091,APPRECIATIONS,was lacking in dramatic force and in the power of characterization;
3092,APPRECIATIONS,"that he was singularly deficient in humor, and therefore in the saving"
3093,APPRECIATIONS,grace of self-criticism in the capacity to see himself occasionally in
3094,APPRECIATIONS,a ridiculous light; that he has little of the romantic glamor and none
3095,APPRECIATIONS,of the narrative energy of Scott; that Shelley's lyrical flights leave
3096,APPRECIATIONS,him plodding along the dusty highway; and that Byron's preternatural
3097,APPRECIATIONS,force makes his passion seen by contrast pale and ineffectual.  All
3098,APPRECIATIONS,"this and more may freely be granted, and yet for his influence upon"
3099,APPRECIATIONS,"English thought, and especially upon the poetic thought of his country,"
3100,APPRECIATIONS,he must be named after Shakespeare and Milton.  The intellectual value
3101,APPRECIATIONS,"of his work will endure; for leaving aside much valuable doctrine,"
3102,APPRECIATIONS,"which from didactic excess fails as poetry, he has brought into the"
3103,APPRECIATIONS,world a new philosophy of Nature and has emphasised in a manner
3104,APPRECIATIONS,distinctively his own the dignity of simple manhood.--_Pelham Edgar_.

3185,MICHAEL,
3186,MICHAEL,"The poem was composed in 1800, and published in the second volume of the"
3187,MICHAEL,"_Lyrical Ballads_ in the same year.  ""Written at the Town-end, Grasmere,"
3188,MICHAEL,"about the same time as _The Brothers_.  The Sheep-fold, on which so much"
3189,MICHAEL,"of the poem turns, remains, or rather the ruins of it.  The character and"
3190,MICHAEL,"circumstances of Luke were taken from a family to whom had belonged, many"
3191,MICHAEL,"years before, the house we lived in at Town-end, along with some fields"
3192,MICHAEL,and woodlands on the eastern shore of Grasmere.  The name of the Evening
3193,MICHAEL,"Star was not in fact given to this house, but to another on the same side"
3194,MICHAEL,"of the valley, more to the north."""
3195,MICHAEL,
3196,MICHAEL,"In a letter to Charles James Fox the poet says: ""In the two poems, _The"
3197,MICHAEL,"Brothers_ and _Michael_, I have attempted to draw a picture of the"
3198,MICHAEL,"domestic affections, as I know they exist among a class of men who are"
3199,MICHAEL,now almost confined to the north of England.  They are small independent
3200,MICHAEL,"_proprietors_ of land, here called 'statesmen' [i.e., estates-men], men"
3201,MICHAEL,"of respectable education, who daily labor on their little properties. . ."
3202,MICHAEL,Their little tract of land serves as a kind of rallying point for their
3203,MICHAEL,"domestic feelings, as a tablet upon which they are written, which makes"
3204,MICHAEL,"them objects of memory in a thousand instances, when they would otherwise"
3205,MICHAEL,be forgotten.  The two poems that I have mentioned were written to show
3206,MICHAEL,"that men who do not wear fine clothes can feel deeply."""
3207,MICHAEL,
3208,MICHAEL,Edward Fulton in a _A Selection of the Shorter Poems of Wordsworth_
3209,MICHAEL,"(Macmillan) says: ""The reason Wordsworth succeeds best in describing the"
3210,MICHAEL,"type of character portrayed in _Michael_ and _The Brothers_ is, of"
3211,MICHAEL,"course, chiefly because he knew that type best; but the fact that it was"
3212,MICHAEL,the type for which he himself might have stood as the representative was
3213,MICHAEL,not without its effect upon him.  His ideal man is but a variation of
3214,MICHAEL,himself.  As Dean Church puts it: 'The ideal man with Wordsworth is the
3215,MICHAEL,"hard-headed, frugal, unambitious dalesman of his own hills, with his"
3216,MICHAEL,"strong affections, his simple tastes, and his quiet and beautiful home;"
3217,MICHAEL,"and this dalesman, built up by communion with nature and by meditation"
3218,MICHAEL,"into the poet-philosopher, with his serious faith and his never-failing"
3219,MICHAEL,"spring of enjoyment, is himself.'  Types of character wholly alien to his"
3220,MICHAEL,own have little attraction for him.  He is content to look into the
3221,MICHAEL,depths of his own heart and to represent what he sees there.  His field
3222,MICHAEL,"of vision, therefore, is a very limited one: it takes in only a few"
3223,MICHAEL,"types.  It is _man_, in fact, rather than men, that interests him."""
3224,MICHAEL,
3225,MICHAEL,The poem _Michael_ is well adapted to show Wordsworth's powers of
3226,MICHAEL,"realism.  He describes the poem as ""a pastoral,"" which at once induces a"
3227,MICHAEL,"comparison, greatly to Wordsworth's advantage, with the pseudo-pastorals"
3228,MICHAEL,of the age of Pope.  There the shepherds and shepherdesses were scarcely
3229,MICHAEL,"the pale shadows of reality, while Wordsworth's poem never swerves from"
3230,MICHAEL,"the line of truth.  ""The poet,"" as Sir Henry Taylor says with reference"
3231,MICHAEL,"to _Michael_, ""writes in his confidence to impart interest to the"
3232,MICHAEL,"realities of life, deriving both the confidence and the power from the"
3233,MICHAEL,deep interest which he feels in them.  It is an attribute of unusual
3234,MICHAEL,susceptibility of imagination to need no extraordinary provocatives; and
3235,MICHAEL,when this is combined with intensity of observation and peculiarity of
3236,MICHAEL,"language, it is the high privilege of the poet so endowed to rest upon"

3495,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,The sonnet form was introduced into English poetry by Sir Thomas Wyatt
3496,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,and the Earl of Surrey.  Their experiments in the sonnet were published
3497,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"in _Tottel's Miscellany_ in 1557, and were prompted by an admiration of"
3498,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,Petrarch and other Italian models.  Italy was almost certainly the
3499,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"original home of the sonnet (sonnet=Ital. _sonetto_, _a little sound_, or"
3500,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"_short strain_, from _suono_, _sound_), and there it has been assiduously"
3501,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,cultivated since the thirteenth century.  In the fourteenth century Dante
3502,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,and Petrarch gave the form a European celebrity.

3506,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3507,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Before saying anything of its development in English poetry, it is"
3508,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"advisable to examine an admittedly perfect sonnet, so that we may gain an"
3509,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"idea of the nature of this type of poem, both as to form and substance."
3510,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Wordsworth's sonnet upon Milton (_London_, 1802) will serve our purpose"
3511,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,(see page 187).  By reference to it you will observe:--
3512,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3513,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"(1) That the sonnet is written in iambic pentameter, and consists of"
3514,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,fourteen lines--that number by repeated experimentation having been found
3515,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,the most appropriate for the expression of a single emotional mood.
3516,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3517,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,(2) As an examination of the rimes will show (a b b a a b b a: c d d e c
3518,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"e), there is a natural metrical division at the end of the eighth line."
3519,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"The first eight lines in technical language are called the ""octave,"" the"
3520,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"last six lines are called the ""sestet."" The octave is sometimes said to"
3521,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"consist of two quatrains, and the sestet of two tercets."
3522,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3523,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,(3) There is not only a metrical division between the octave and the
3524,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"sestet, but the character of the thought also undergoes a subtle change"
3525,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"at that point.  It is to be understood, of course, that in the whole poem"
3526,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"there must be both unity of thought and mood.  Yet, at the ninth line,"
3527,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"the thought which is introduced in the octave is elaborated, and"
3528,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,presented as it were under another aspect.  As Mr. Mark Pattison has
3529,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"admirably expressed it: ""This thought or mood should be led up to, and"
3530,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"opened in the early lines of the sonnet; strictly, in the first quatrain;"
3531,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,in the second quatrain the hearer should be placed in full possession of
3532,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"it.  After the second quatrain there should be a pause--not full, nor"
3533,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,producing the effect of a break--as of one who had finished what he had
3534,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"got to say, and not preparing a transition to a new subject, but as of"
3535,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,one who is turning over what has been said in the mind to enforce it
3536,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"further.  The opening of the second system, strictly the first tercet,"
3537,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"should turn back upon the thought or sentiment, take it up and carry it"
3538,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,forward to the conclusion.  The conclusion should be a resultant summing
3539,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,the total of the suggestion in the preceding lines. . . .  While the
3540,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"conclusion should leave a sense of finish and completeness, it is"
3541,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"necessary to avoid anything like epigrammatic point."""
3542,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3543,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,(4) An examination of the rimes again will show that greater strictness
3544,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,prevails in the octave than in the sestet.  The most regular type of the
3545,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"octave may be represented by a b b a a b b a, turning therefore upon two"
3546,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"rimes only.  The sestet, though it contains but six lines, is more"
3547,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,liberal in the disposition of its rimes.  In the sonnet which we are
3548,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"examining, the rime system of the sestet in c d d e c e--containing, as"
3549,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"we see, three separate rimes.  In the sestet this is permissible,"
3550,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,provided that there is not a riming couplet at the close.
3551,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3552,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"(5) Again, with reference to the rime, it will be observed that the vowel"
3553,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,terminals of the octave and the sestet are differentiated.  Anything
3554,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,approaching assonance between the two divisions is to be counted as a
3555,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,defect.
3556,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3557,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,(6) It is evident that there is unity both of thought and mood in this
3558,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"sonnet, the sestet being differentiated from the octave, only as above"
3559,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,described.
3560,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3561,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"(7) It is almost unnecessary to add that there is no slovenly diction,"
3562,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"that the language is dignified in proportion to the theme, and that there"
3563,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,is no obscurity or repetition in thought or phraseology.
3564,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3565,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,These rules will appear to the young reader of poetry as almost
3566,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,unnecessarily severe.  But it must be remembered that the sonnet is
3567,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,avowedly a conventional form (though in it much of the finest poetry in
3568,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"our language is contained), and as such the conventional laws attaching"
3569,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,to all prescribed forms must be observed to win complete success.
3570,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3571,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton have lent the authority of their great"
3572,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,names to certain distinct variations from the rigid Petrarchan type.  The
3573,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,peculiarity of Spenser's sonnets is that the rime of the octave overflows
3574,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"into the sestet, thus marring the exquisite balance which should subsist"
3575,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"between the two parts, and yielding an effect of cloying sweetness."
3576,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Although the famous stanza-form which he invented in his ""Faerie Queene"""
3577,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"has found many imitators, his sonnet innovations are practically"
3578,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,unimportant.
3579,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3580,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"The Shakespearean sonnet, on the contrary, must be regarded as a"
3581,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,well-established variant from the stricter Italian form.  Though
3582,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Shakespeare's name has made it famous, it did not originate with him."
3583,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Surrey and Daniel had habitually employed it, and in fact it had come to"
3584,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"be recognized as the accepted English form.  Its characteristic feature,"
3585,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"as the following sonnet from Shakespeare will show, was a division into"
3586,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"three distinct quatrains, each with alternating rimes, and closed by a"
3587,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,couplet.  The transition of thought at the ninth line is usually
3588,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,observed:--
3589,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3590,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"""When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,"
3591,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"I all alone beweep my outcast state,"
3592,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,"
3593,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"And look upon myself, and curse my fate,"
3594,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,"
3595,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,"
3596,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,"
3597,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,With what I most enjoy contented least;
3598,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,"
3599,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Haply I think on thee--and then my state,"
3600,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,Like to the lark at break of day arising
3601,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;"
3602,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings,"
3603,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"That then I scorn to change my state with kings."""
3604,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3605,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,It is Milton's merit that he rescued the sonnet from the snare of verbal
3606,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"wit in which the Elizabethans had involved it, and made it respond to"
3607,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"other passions than that of love.  His sonnets, as imitations of the"
3608,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Italian form, are more successful than the scattered efforts in that"
3609,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"direction of Wyatt and Surrey.  They are indeed regular in all respects,"
3610,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"save that he is not always careful to observe the pause in the thought,"
3611,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,and the subtle change which should divide the octave from the sestet.
3612,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3613,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,After Milton there is a pause in sonnet-writing for a hundred years.
3614,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"William Lisles Bowles (1762-1850), memorable for his influence upon"
3615,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Coleridge, was among the first again to cultivate the form.  Coleridge"
3616,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"and Shelley gave the sonnet scant attention, and were careless as to its"
3617,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"structural qualities.  Keats, apart from Wordsworth, was the only poet of"
3618,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,the early years of the century who realized its capabilities.  He has
3619,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"written a few of our memorable sonnets, but he was not entirely satisfied"
3620,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"with the accepted form, and experimented upon variations that cannot be"
3621,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,regarded as successful.
3622,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3623,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,There is no doubt that the stimulus to sonnet-writing in the nineteenth
3624,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"century came from Wordsworth, and he, as all his recent biographers"
3625,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"admit, received his inspiration from Milton.  Wordsworth's sonnets, less"
3626,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"remarkable certainly than a supreme few of Shakespeare's, have still"
3627,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"imposed themselves as models upon all later writers, while the"
3628,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Shakespearean form has fallen into disuse.  A word here, therefore, as to"
3629,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,their form.
3630,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3631,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,The strict rime movement of the octave a b b a a b b a is observed in
3632,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"seven only of the present collection of twelve, namely, in the first"
3633,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"sonnet, the second, the third, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh, and the"
3634,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,eighth.  The rime formula of the octave with which Wordsworth's name is
3635,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,chiefly associated is a b b a a c c a.  The sonnets in which this
3636,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"additional rime is introduced are the fourth, the ninth, the tenth, the"
3637,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,eleventh and the twelfth.
3638,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3639,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,As regards the transition from octave to sestet the following sonnets
3640,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"observe the prescribed law, namely, the second, third, sixth, seventh,"
3641,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,and ninth.  The seven remaining sonnets all show some irregularity in
3642,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,this respect.  The first sonnet (_Fair Star_) with its abrupt
3643,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"_enjambement_ at the close of the octave, and the thought pause in the"
3644,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"body of the first line of the sestet, is a form much employed by Mrs."
3645,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"Browning, but rigorously avoided by Dante Gabriel Rossetti with his more"
3646,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,scrupulous ideal of sonnet construction.  This imperfect transition is
3647,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,"seen again in the fourth, fifth, eighth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth"
3648,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,sonnets.  Its boldness certainly amounts to a technical fault in the two
3649,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,sonnets on _King's College Chapel_.
3650,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,
3651,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,In the sestet we naturally expect and find much variety in the
3652,A BRIEF HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION OF THE SONNET,disposition of the rimes.  The conclusion of the last sonnet by a couplet

3740,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"his family; he was sincerely devoted to them, however, and himself"
3741,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"supervised their education.  His mother, Elizabeth Fytche, the daughter"

3746,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3747,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"The family was large, consisting of twelve sons and daughters, of whom"

3750,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"happy one.  The boys and girls were all fond of books, and their games"

3752,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"given to writing, and in this they were encouraged by their father, who"
3753,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,proved himself a wise and discriminating critic.  Alfred early showed
3754,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,signs of his poetic bent; at the age of twelve he had written an epic of
3755,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"four thousand lines, and even before this a tragedy and innumerable poems"
3756,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"in blank verse.  He was not encouraged, however, to preserve these"

3777,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"poems were included in the volume.  The brothers were promised 20 pounds,"
3778,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,but more than one half of this sum they had to take out in books.  With
3779,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"the balance they went on a triumphal expedition to the sea, rejoicing in"
3780,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,the successful launching of their first literary effort.
3781,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3782,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1828 Charles and Alfred Tennyson matriculated at Trinity College,"
3783,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Cambridge, where their elder brother Frederick had already been for some"
3784,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"time.  Alfred was a somewhat shy lad, and did not at once take kindly to"
3785,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"the life of his college.  He soon, however, found himself one of a famous"
3786,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"society known as ""The Apostles,"" to which belonged some of the best men"
3787,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"in the University.  Not one member of the ""Apostles"" at this time, but"
3788,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"afterwards made a name for himself, and made his influence felt in the"
3789,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"world of politics or letters.  The society met at regular intervals, but"
3790,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Alfred did not take much part in the debates, preferring to sit silent"
3791,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and listen to what was said.  All his friends had unbounded admiration
3792,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,for his poetry and unlimited faith in his poetic powers.  This faith was
3793,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,strengthened by the award of the University Prize for English Verse to
3794,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Alfred in June, 1829.  He did not wish to compete, but on being pressed,"
3795,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"polished up an old poem that he had written some years before, and"
3796,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"presented it for competition, the subject being _Timbuctoo_.  The poem"
3797,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,was in blank verse and really showed considerable power; in fact it was a
3798,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,remarkable poem for one so young.
3799,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3800,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Perhaps the most powerful influence on the life of Tennyson was the
3801,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"friendship he formed while at Cambridge with Arthur Henry Hallam, the son"
3802,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"of the historian, Henry Hallam.  The two became inseparable friends, a"
3803,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,friendship strengthened by the engagement of Hallam to the poet's sister.
3804,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,The two friends agreed to publish a volume of poems as a
3805,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"joint-production, but Henry Hallam, the elder, did not encourage the"
3806,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"project, and it was dropped.  The result was that in 1830, _Poems,"
3807,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Chiefly Lyrical_, was published with the name of Alfred Tennyson alone on"
3808,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"the title page.  The volume was reviewed enthusiastically by Hallam, but"
3809,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,was more or less slated by Christopher North in the columns of
3810,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,_Blackwoods' Magazine_.  Tennyson was very angry about the latter review
3811,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"and replied to the reviewer in some caustic, but entirely unnecessary,"
3812,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,verses.
3813,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3814,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,In the same year Hallam and Tennyson made an expedition into Spain to
3815,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,carry aid to the rebel leader against the king of Spain.  The expedition
3816,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"was not by any means a success.  In 1831 Tennyson left Cambridge, without"
3817,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"taking his degree, and shortly after his return home his father died."
3818,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"The family, however, did not remove from Somersby, but remained there"
3819,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,until 1837.  Late in 1832 appeared another volume entitled _Poems by
3820,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Alfred Tennyson_.  This drew upon the unfortunate author a bitterly
3821,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"sarcastic article in the _Quarterly_, written probably by its brilliant"
3822,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"editor, John Gibson Lockhart.  The result of this article was that"
3823,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Tennyson was silent for almost ten years, a period spent in ridding"
3824,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,himself of the weaknesses so brutally pointed out by the reviewer.
3825,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3826,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1833, Arthur Henry Hallam died, and for a time the light of life"
3827,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,seemed to have gone out for Alfred Tennyson.  The effect of the death of
3828,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Hallam upon the poet was extraordinary.  It seemed to have changed the
3829,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"whole current of his life; indeed he is said, under the strain of the"
3830,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"awful suddeness and unexpectedness of the event, to have contemplated"
3831,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"suicide.  But saner thoughts intervened, and he again took up the burden"
3832,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"of life, with the determination to do what he could in helping others."
3833,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,From this time of storm and stress came _In Memoriam_.
3834,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3835,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"From 1832 to 1842 Tennyson spent a roving life.  Now at home, now in"
3836,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"London, now with his friends in various parts of England.  He was"
3837,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"spending his time in finishing his poems, so that when he again came"
3838,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"before the world with a volume, he would be a master.  The circle of his"
3839,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"friends was widening, and now included the greater number of the"
3840,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"master-minds of England.  He was poor, so poor in fact that he was"
3841,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,reduced to the necessity of borrowing the books he wished to read from
3842,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,his friends.  But during all this time he never wavered in his allegiance
3843,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"to poetry; he had determined to be a poet, and to devote his life to"
3844,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"poetry.  At last in 1842 he published his _Poems_ in two volumes, and the"
3845,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,world was conquered.  From this time onwards he was recognized as the
3846,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,leading poet of his century.
3847,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3848,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"In 1845, Tennyson, poor still, was granted a pension of 200 pounds,"
3849,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"chiefly through the influence of his friend Richard Monckton Milnes, and"
3850,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Thomas Carlyle.  There was a great deal of criticism regarding this
3851,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"pension from sources that should have been favorable, but the general"
3852,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"verdict approved the grant.  In 1847 appeared _The Princess_, a poem,"
3853,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"which, at that time, did not materially add to his fame; but the poet was"
3854,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"now hailed as one of the great ones of his time, and much was expected of"
3855,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,him.
3856,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3857,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,In 1850 three most important events in the life of Tennyson happened.  He
3858,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"published _In Memoriam_, in memory of his friend, Arthur Henry Hallam; he"
3859,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"was appointed Poet Laureate, in succession to Wordsworth; and he married"
3860,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Emily Selwood, a lady to whom he had been engaged for seventeen years,"
3861,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,but whom his poverty had prevented him from leading to the altar.  From
3862,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,this time onwards the life of the poet flowed smoothly.  He was happily
3863,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"married, his fame was established, his books brought him sufficient"
3864,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,income on which to live comfortable and well.  From this point there is
3865,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"little to relate in his career, except the publication of his various"
3866,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,volumes.
3867,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3868,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"After his marriage Tennyson lived for some time at Twickenham, where in"
3869,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"1852 Hallam Tennyson was born.  In 1851 he and his wife visited Italy, a"
3870,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,visit commemorated in _The Daisy_.  In 1853 they removed to Farringford
3871,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"at Freshwater in the Isle of Wight, a residence subsequently purchased"
3872,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"with the proceeds of _Maud_, published in 1855.  The poem had a somewhat"
3873,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"mixed reception, being received in some quarters with unstinted abuse and"
3874,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,in others with the warmest praise.  In the year that _Maud_ was published
3875,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Tennyson received the honorary degree of D.C.L., from Oxford.  In 1859"
3876,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"was published the first four of the _Idylls of the King_, followed in"
3877,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,1864 by _Enoch Arden and Other Poems_.  In 1865 his mother died.  In 1869
3878,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"he occupied Aldworth, an almost inaccessible residence in Surrey, near"
3879,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"London, in order to escape the annoyance of summer visitors to the Isle"
3880,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"of Wight, who insisted on invading his privacy, which, perhaps, more than"
3881,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,any other he especially valued.
3882,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3883,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,From 1870 to 1880 Tennyson was engaged principally on his dramas--_Queen
3884,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Mary_, _Harold_, and _Becket_,--but, with the exception of the last,"
3885,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,these did not prove particularly successful on the stage.  In 1880
3886,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"_Ballads and Poems_ was published, an astonishing volume from one so"
3887,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"advanced in years.  In 1882 the _Promise of May_ was produced in public,"
3888,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,but was soon withdrawn.  In 1884 Tennyson was raised to the peerage as
3889,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Baron Tennyson of Aldworth and Farringford, after having on two previous"
3890,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,occasions refused a baronetcy.  In 1885 _Tiresias and Other Poems_ was
3891,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"published.  In this volume was published _Balin and Balan_, thus"
3892,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"completing the _Idylls of the King_, which now assumed their permanent"
3893,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"order and form.  _Demeter and Other Poems_ followed in 1889, including"
3894,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"_Crossing the Bar_.  In 1892, on October 6th, the poet died at Aldworth,"
3895,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"""with the moonlight upon his bed and an open Shakespeare by his side.""  A"
3896,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"few days later he was buried in Westminster Abbey, by the side of Robert"
3897,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Browning, his friend and contemporary, who had preceded him by only a few"
3898,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,years.
3899,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,
3900,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,Carlyle has left us a graphic description of Tennyson as he was in middle
3901,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"life: ""One of the finest--looking men in the world.  A great shock of"
3902,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"rough, dusky dark hair; bright, laughing hazel eyes; massive aquiline"
3903,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"face--most massive yet most delicate; of sallow brown complexion, almost"
3904,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"Indian-looking; clothes cynically loose, free-and-easy; smokes infinite"
3905,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,tobacco.  His voice is musically metallic--fit for loud laughter and
3906,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"piercing wail, and all that may lie between; speech and speculation free"
3907,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,and plenteous; I do not meet in these late decades such company over a
3908,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"pipe!  We shall see what he will grow to.""  To this may be added a"
3909,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"paragraph from Caroline Fox: ""Tennyson is a grand specimen of a man, with"
3910,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,a magnificent head set on his shoulders like the capital of a mighty
3911,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,pillar.  His hair is long and wavy and covers a massive head.  He wears a
3912,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"beard and mustache, which one begrudges as hiding so much of that firm,"
3913,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"powerful, but finely-chiselled mouth.  His eyes are large and gray, and"
3914,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,open wide when a subject interests him; they are well shaded by the noble
3915,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"brow, with its strong lines of thought and suffering.  I can quite"
3916,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,understand Samuel Lawrence calling it the best balance of head he had
3917,BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH,"ever seen."""

4024,APPRECIATIONS,"distinctly pre-eminent above all his contemporaries, so truly the king of"
4025,APPRECIATIONS,"the poets, as he upon whose brows now rests the Laureate crown.  Dryden's"
4026,APPRECIATIONS,"grandeur was sullied, his muse was venal, and his life was vicious; still"
4027,APPRECIATIONS,in his keeping the office acquired a certain dignity; after his death it
4028,APPRECIATIONS,"declined into the depths of depredation, and each succeeding dullard"

4030,APPRECIATIONS,"into life with the appointment of Southey, to whom succeeded Wordsworth,"
4031,APPRECIATIONS,"a poet of worth and genius, whose name certainly assisted in"
4032,APPRECIATIONS,resuscitating the ancient dignity of the appointment.  Alfred Tennyson
4033,APPRECIATIONS,derives less honor from the title than he confers upon it; to him we owe
4034,APPRECIATIONS,"a debt of gratitude that he has redeemed the laurels with his poetry,"

4036,APPRECIATIONS,
4037,APPRECIATIONS,"""Tennyson is many sided; he has a great variety of subjects.  He has"
4038,APPRECIATIONS,treated of the classical and the romantic life of the world; he has been
4039,APPRECIATIONS,keenly alive to the beauties of nature; and he has tried to sympathize
4040,APPRECIATIONS,with the social problems that confront mankind.  In this respect he is a
4041,APPRECIATIONS,"representative poet of the age, for this very diversity of natural gifts"
4042,APPRECIATIONS,has made him popular with all classes.  Perhaps he has not been perfectly
4043,APPRECIATIONS,"cosmopolitan, and sometimes the theme in his poetry has received a slight"
4044,APPRECIATIONS,treatment compared to what might have been given it by deeper thinking
4045,APPRECIATIONS,"and more philosophical poets, but he has caught the spirit of the age and"
4046,APPRECIATIONS,"has expressed its thought, if not always forcibly, at least more"
4047,APPRECIATIONS,"beautifully than any other poet,""--_Charles Read Nutter_."
4048,APPRECIATIONS,
4049,APPRECIATIONS,"""In technical elegance, as an artist in verse, Tennyson is the greatest"
4050,APPRECIATIONS,"of modern poets.  Other masters, old and new, have surpassed him in"
4051,APPRECIATIONS,"special instances; but he is the only one who rarely nods, and who always"
4052,APPRECIATIONS,"finishes his verse to the extreme.  Here is the absolute sway of metre,"
4053,APPRECIATIONS,compelling every rhyme and measure needful to the thought; here are
4054,APPRECIATIONS,"sinuous alliterations, unique and varying breaks and pauses, winged"
4055,APPRECIATIONS,"flights and falls, the glory of sound and color everywhere present, or,"
4056,APPRECIATIONS,"if missing, absent of the poet's free will.  The fullness of his art"
4057,APPRECIATIONS,evades the charm of spontaneity.  His original and fastidious art is of
4058,APPRECIATIONS,"itself a theme for an essay.  The poet who studies it may well despair,"
4059,APPRECIATIONS,"he can never excel it; its strength is that of perfection; its weakness,"

4062,APPRECIATIONS,
4063,APPRECIATIONS,"""A striking quality of Tennyson's poetry is its simplicity, both in"
4064,APPRECIATIONS,"thought and expression.  This trait was characteristic of his life, and"
4065,APPRECIATIONS,so we naturally expect to find it in his verse.  Tennyson was too sincere
4066,APPRECIATIONS,"by nature, and too strongly averse to experimenting in new fields of"
4067,APPRECIATIONS,"poetry, to attempt the affected or unique.  He purposely avoided all"
4068,APPRECIATIONS,subjects which he feared he could not treat with simplicity and
4069,APPRECIATIONS,"clearness.  So, in his shorter poems, there are few obscure or ambiguous"
4070,APPRECIATIONS,"passages, little that is not easy of comprehension.  His subjects"
4071,APPRECIATIONS,themselves tend to prevent ambiguity or obscurity.  For he wrote of men
4072,APPRECIATIONS,"and women as he saw them about him, of their joys and sorrows, their"
4073,APPRECIATIONS,"trials, their ideals,--and in this was nothing complex.  Thus there is a"
4074,APPRECIATIONS,"homely quality to his poems, but they are kept from the commonplace by"
4075,APPRECIATIONS,the great tenderness of his feeling.  Had Tennyson been primarily of a
4076,APPRECIATIONS,metaphysical or philosophical mind all this might have been different.
4077,APPRECIATIONS,"True, he was somewhat of a student of philosophy and religion, and some"
4078,APPRECIATIONS,"of his poems are of these subjects, but his thought even here is always"
4079,APPRECIATIONS,"simple and plain, and he never attempted the deep study that was not"
4080,APPRECIATIONS,characteristic of his nature.  No less successful is he in avoiding
4081,APPRECIATIONS,obscurity in expression.  There are few passages that need much
4082,APPRECIATIONS,"explanation.  In this he offers a striking contrast to Browning, who"
4083,APPRECIATIONS,often painfully hid his meaning under complex phraseology.  His
4084,APPRECIATIONS,"vocabulary is remarkably large, and when we study his use of words, we"
4085,APPRECIATIONS,find that in many cases they are from the two-syllabled class.  This
4086,APPRECIATIONS,"matter of choice of clear, simple words and phrases is very important."
4087,APPRECIATIONS,"For, just so much as our attention is drawn from what a poet says to the"
4088,APPRECIATIONS,"medium, the language in which he says it, so much is its clearness"
4089,APPRECIATIONS,injured.  Vividly to see pictures in our imagination or to be affected by
4090,APPRECIATIONS,"our emotions, we must not, as we read, experience any jar.  In Tennyson"
4091,APPRECIATIONS,we never have to think of his expressions--except to admire their simple
4092,APPRECIATIONS,"beauty.  Simplicity and beauty, then, are two noticeable qualities of his"

4106,APPRECIATIONS,are exercised to the utmost in detecting the minutest relations and most
4107,APPRECIATIONS,"evanescent melodies of the objects before him, in order that his"
4108,APPRECIATIONS,representation shall include everything which is important to their full
4109,APPRECIATIONS,perfection.  His pictures of rural English scenery give the inner spirit
4110,APPRECIATIONS,"as well as the outward form of the objects, and represent them, also, in"
4111,APPRECIATIONS,their relation to the mind which is gazing on them.  The picture in his
4112,APPRECIATIONS,"mind is spread out before his detecting and dissecting intellect, to be"
4113,APPRECIATIONS,transformed to words only when it can be done with the most refined
4114,APPRECIATIONS,"exactness, both as regards color and form and melody.""--_E.P. Whipple_."
4115,APPRECIATIONS,
4116,APPRECIATIONS,"""For the most part he wrote of the every day loves and duties of men and"
4117,APPRECIATIONS,women; of the primal pains and joys of humanity; of the aspirations and
4118,APPRECIATIONS,trials which are common to all ages and all classes and independent even
4119,APPRECIATIONS,"of the diseases of civilization, but he made them new and surprising by"
4120,APPRECIATIONS,"the art which he added to them, by beauty of thought, tenderness of"
4121,APPRECIATIONS,"feeling, and exquisiteness of shaping.""--_Stopford A.  Brooke_."
4122,APPRECIATIONS,
4123,APPRECIATIONS,"""The tenderness of Tennyson is one of his remarkable qualities--not so"
4124,APPRECIATIONS,"much in itself, for other poets have been more tender--but in combination"
4125,APPRECIATIONS,with his rough powers.  We are not surprised that his rugged strength is
4126,APPRECIATIONS,"capable of the mighty and tragic tenderness of Rispah, but we could not"
4127,APPRECIATIONS,think at first that he could feel and realize the exquisite tenderness of
4128,APPRECIATIONS,"_Elaine_.  It is a wonderful thing to have so wide a tenderness, and only"
4129,APPRECIATIONS,"a great poet can possess it and use it well.""--_Stopford A. Brooke_."
4130,APPRECIATIONS,
4131,APPRECIATIONS,"""Tennyson is a great master of pathos; knows the very tones that go to"
4132,APPRECIATIONS,the heart; can arrest every one of these looks of upbraiding or appeal by
4133,APPRECIATIONS,which human woe brings the tear into the human eye.  The pathos is deep;
4134,APPRECIATIONS,"but it is the majesty not the prostration of grief.""--_Peter Bayne_."
4135,APPRECIATIONS,
4136,APPRECIATIONS,"""Indeed the truth must be strongly borne in upon even the warmest"
4137,APPRECIATIONS,admirers of Tennyson that his recluse manner of life closed to him many
4138,APPRECIATIONS,"avenues of communication with the men and women of his day, and that,"
4139,APPRECIATIONS,"whether as a result or cause of his exclusiveness, he had but little of"
4140,APPRECIATIONS,"that restless, intellectual curiosity which constantly whets itself upon"
4141,APPRECIATIONS,"new experiences, finds significance where others see confusion, and"
4142,APPRECIATIONS,beneath the apparently commonplace in human character reaches some
4143,APPRECIATIONS,harmonizing truth.  _Rizpah_ and _The Grandmother_ show what a rich
4144,APPRECIATIONS,harvest he would have reaped had he cared more frequently to walk the
4145,APPRECIATIONS,thoroughfares of life.  His finely wrought character studies are very few
4146,APPRECIATIONS,"in number, and even the range of his types is disappointingly"
4147,APPRECIATIONS,"narrow.""--_Pelham Edgar_."
4148,APPRECIATIONS,
4149,APPRECIATIONS,"""No reader of Tennyson can miss the note of patriotism which he"
4150,APPRECIATIONS,"perpetually sounds.  He has a deep and genuine love of country, a pride"
4151,APPRECIATIONS,"in the achievements of the past, a confidence in the greatness of the"
4152,APPRECIATIONS,future.  And this sense of patriotism almost reaches insularity of view.
4153,APPRECIATIONS,"He looks out upon the larger world with a gentle commiseration, and"
4154,APPRECIATIONS,surveys its un-English habits and constitution with sympathetic contempt.
4155,APPRECIATIONS,The patriotism of Tennyson is sober rather than glowing; it is meditative
4156,APPRECIATIONS,"rather than enthusiastic.  Occasionally indeed, his words catch fire, and"
4157,APPRECIATIONS,"the verse leaps onward with a sound of triumph, as in such a poem as _The"
4158,APPRECIATIONS,Charge of the Light Brigade_ or in such a glorious ballad as _The
4159,APPRECIATIONS,Revenge_.  Neither of these poems is likely to perish until the glory of
4160,APPRECIATIONS,"the nation perishes, and her deeds of a splendid chivalrous past sink"
4161,APPRECIATIONS,"into oblivion, which only shameful cowardice can bring upon her.  But as"
4162,APPRECIATIONS,a rule Tennyson's patriotism is not a contagious and inspiring
4163,APPRECIATIONS,"patriotism.  It is meditative, philosophic, self-complacent.  It rejoices"
4164,APPRECIATIONS,"in the infallibility of the English judgment, the eternal security of"
4165,APPRECIATIONS,"English institutions, the perfection of English forms of"
4166,APPRECIATIONS,"government.""--_W. J. Dawson_."
4167,APPRECIATIONS,
4168,APPRECIATIONS,"""Tennyson always speaks from the side of virtue; and not of that new and"
4169,APPRECIATIONS,"strange virtue which some of our later poets have exalted, and which,"
4170,APPRECIATIONS,"when it is stripped of its fine garments, turns out to be nothing else"
4171,APPRECIATIONS,than the unrestrained indulgence of every natural impulse; but rather of
4172,APPRECIATIONS,"that old fashioned virtue whose laws are 'self-reverence, self-knowledge,"
4173,APPRECIATIONS,"self-control,' and which finds its highest embodiment in the morality of"
4174,APPRECIATIONS,"the _New Testament_.  There is a spiritual courage in his work, a force"
4175,APPRECIATIONS,"of fate which conquers doubt and darkness, a light of inward hope which"
4176,APPRECIATIONS,burns dauntless under the shadow of death.  Tennyson is the poet of
4177,APPRECIATIONS,faith; faith as distinguished from cold dogmatism and the acceptance of
4178,APPRECIATIONS,"traditional creeds; faith which does not ignore doubt and mystery, but"
4179,APPRECIATIONS,triumphs over them and faces the unknown with fearless heart.  The effect
4180,APPRECIATIONS,of Christianity upon the poetry of Tennyson may be felt in its general
4181,APPRECIATIONS,moral quality.  By this it is not meant that he is always preaching.  But
4182,APPRECIATIONS,"at the same time the poet can hardly help revealing, more by tone and"
4183,APPRECIATIONS,"accent than by definite words, his moral sympathies.  He is essentially"
4184,APPRECIATIONS,and characteristically a poet with a message.  His poetry does not exist
4185,APPRECIATIONS,merely for the sake of its own perfection of form.  It is something more
4186,APPRECIATIONS,than the sound of one who has a lovely voice and can play skilfully upon
4187,APPRECIATIONS,an instrument.  It is a poetry with a meaning and a purpose.  It is a
4188,APPRECIATIONS,voice that has something to say to us about life.  When we read his poems
4189,APPRECIATIONS,"we feel our hearts uplifted, we feel that, after all it is worth while to"
4190,APPRECIATIONS,"struggle towards the light, it is worth while to try to be upright and"
4191,APPRECIATIONS,"generous and true and loyal and pure, for virtue is victory and goodness"
4192,APPRECIATIONS,is the only fadeless and immortal crown.  The secret of the poet's
4193,APPRECIATIONS,influence must lie in his spontaneous witness to the reality and
4194,APPRECIATIONS,supremacy of the moral life.  His music must thrill us with the
4195,APPRECIATIONS,"conviction that the humblest child of man has a duty, an ideal, a"
4196,APPRECIATIONS,"destiny.  He must sing of justice and of love as a sure reward, a"
4197,APPRECIATIONS,"steadfast law, the safe port and haven of the soul.""--_Henry Van Dyke_."

4289,NOTES,
4290,OENONE,OENONE
4291,OENONE,
4292,OENONE,"""The poem of _Oenone_ is the first of Tennyson's elaborate essays in a"
4293,OENONE,metre over which be afterwards obtained an eminent command.  It is also
4294,OENONE,"the first of his idylls and of his classical studies, with their"
4295,OENONE,"melodious rendering of the Homeric epithets and the composite words,"
4296,OENONE,which Tennyson had the art of coining after the Greek manner
4297,OENONE,"('lily-cradled,' 'river-sundered,' 'dewy-dashed') for compact description"
4298,OENONE,or ornament.  Several additions were made in a later edition; and the
4299,OENONE,corrections then made show with what sedulous care the poet diversified
4300,OENONE,"the structure of his lines, changing the pauses that break the monotonous"
4301,OENONE,"run of blank verse, and avoiding the use of weak terminals when the line"
4302,OENONE,ends in the middle of a sentence.  The opening of the poem was in this
4303,OENONE,manner decidedly improved; yet one may judge that the finest passages are
4304,OENONE,still to be found almost as they stood in the original version; and the
4305,OENONE,"concluding lines, in which the note of anguish culminates, are left"
4306,OENONE,"untouched."""
4307,OENONE,
4308,OENONE,"""Nevertheless the blank verse of _Oenone_ lacks the even flow and"
4309,OENONE,harmonious balance of entire sections in the _Morte d'Arthur_ or
4310,OENONE,"_Ulysses_, where the lines are swift or slow, rise to a point and fall"
4311,OENONE,"gradually, in cadences arranged to correspond with the dramatic movement,"
4312,OENONE,showing that the poet has extended and perfected his metrical resources.
4313,OENONE,The later style is simplified; he has rejected cumbrous metaphor; he is
4314,OENONE,less sententious; he has pruned away the flowery exuberance and lightened
4315,OENONE,"the sensuous colour of his earlier composition.""--_Sir Alfred Lyall_."
4316,OENONE,
4317,OENONE,First published in 1832-3.  It received its present improved form in the
4318,OENONE,"edition of 1842.  The story of Paris and Oenone may be read in Lempriere,"
4319,OENONE,or in any good classical dictionary.  Briefly it is as follows:--Paris
4320,OENONE,"was the son of Priam, King of Troy, and Hecuba.  It was foretold that he"
4321,OENONE,"would bring great ruin on Troy, so his father ordered him to be slain at"
4322,OENONE,"birth.  The slave, however, did not destroy him, but exposed him upon"
4323,OENONE,"Mount Ida, where shepherds found him and, brought him up as one of"
4324,OENONE,"themselves.  ""He gained the esteem of all the shepherds, and his graceful"
4325,OENONE,countenance and manly development recommended him to the favour of
4326,OENONE,"Oenone, a nymph of Ida, whom he married, and with whom he lived in the"
4327,OENONE,most perfect tenderness.  Their conjugal bliss was soon disturbed.  At
4328,OENONE,"the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, Eris, the goddess of discord, who had"
4329,OENONE,"not been invited to partake of the entertainment, showed her displeasure"
4330,OENONE,"by throwing into the assembly of gods, who were at the celebration of the"
4331,OENONE,"nuptials, a golden apple on which were written the words _Detur"
4332,OENONE,pulchriori_.  All the goddesses claimed it as their own: the contention
4333,OENONE,"at first became general, but at last only three, Juno (Herè), Venus"
4334,OENONE,"(Aphrodite), and Minerva (Pallas), wished to dispute their respective"
4335,OENONE,"right to beauty.  The gods, unwilling to become arbiters in an affair of"
4336,OENONE,"so tender and delicate a nature, appointed Paris to adjudge the prize of"
4337,OENONE,"beauty to the fairest of the goddesses, and indeed the shepherd seemed"
4338,OENONE,"properly qualified to decide so great a contest, as his wisdom was so"
4339,OENONE,"well established, and his prudence and sagacity so well known.  The"
4340,OENONE,"goddesses appeared before their judge without any covering or ornament,"
4341,OENONE,"and each tried by promises and entreaties to gain the attention of Paris,"
4342,OENONE,"and to influence his judgment.  Juno promised him a kingdom; Minerva,"
4343,OENONE,"military glory; and Venus, the fairest woman in the world for his wife."""
4344,OENONE,"(Lempriere.)  Paris accorded the apple to Aphrodite, abandoned Oenone,"
4345,OENONE,"and after he had been acknowledged the son of Priam went to Sparta, where"
4346,OENONE,"he persuaded Helen, the wife of Menelaus, to flee with him to Troy.  The"
4347,OENONE,"ten years' siege, and the destruction of Troy, resulted from this rash"
4348,OENONE,act.  Oenone's significant words at the close of the poem foreshadow this
4349,OENONE,"disaster.  Tennyson, in his old age concluded the narrative in the poem"
4350,OENONE,"called _The Death of Oenone_.  According to the legend Paris, mortally"
4351,OENONE,"wounded by one of the arrows of Philoctetes, sought out the abandoned"
4352,OENONE,Oenone that she might heal him of his wound.  But he died before he
4353,OENONE,"reached her, ""and the nymph, still mindful of their former loves, threw"
4354,OENONE,"herself upon his body, and stabbed herself to the heart, after she had"
4355,OENONE,"plentifully bathed it with her tears.""  Tennyson follows another"
4356,OENONE,"tradition in which Paris reaches Oenone, who scornfully repels him.  He"
4357,OENONE,"passed onward through the mist, and dropped dead upon the mountain side."
4358,OENONE,His old shepherd playmates built his funeral pyre.  Oenone follows the
4359,OENONE,"yearning in her heart to where her husband lies, and dies in the flames"
4360,OENONE,that consume him.
4361,OENONE,
4362,OENONE,"In Chapter IV of Mr. Stopford Brooke's _Tennyson_, there is a valuable"
4363,OENONE,commentary upon _Oenone_.  He deals first with the imaginative treatment
4364,OENONE,"of the landscape, which is characteristic of all Tennyson's classical"
4365,OENONE,"poems, and instances the remarkable improvement effected in the"
4366,OENONE,"descriptive passages in the volume of 1842.  ""But fine landscape and fine"
4367,OENONE,"figure re-drawing are not enough to make a fine poem.  Human interest,"
4368,OENONE,"human passion, must be greater than Nature, and dominate the subject."
4369,OENONE,"Indeed, all this lovely scenery is nothing in comparison with the sorrow"
4370,OENONE,"and love of Oenone, recalling her lost love in the places where once she"
4371,OENONE,lived in joy.  This is the main humanity of the poem.  But there is more.
4372,OENONE,Her common sorrow is lifted almost into the proportions of Greek tragedy
4373,OENONE,"by its cause and by its results.  It is caused by a quarrel in Olympus,"
4374,OENONE,and the mountain nymph is sacrificed without a thought to the vanity of
4375,OENONE,the careless gods.  That is an ever-recurring tragedy in human history.
4376,OENONE,"Moreover, the personal tragedy deepens when we see the fateful dread in"
4377,OENONE,"Oenone's heart that she will, far away, in time hold her lover's life in"
4378,OENONE,"her hands, and refuse to give it back to him--a fatality that Tennyson"
4379,OENONE,"treated before he died.  And, secondly, Oenone's sorrow is lifted into"
4380,OENONE,dignity by the vast results which flowed from its cause.  Behind it were
4381,OENONE,"the mighty fates of Troy, the ten years' battle, the anger of Achilles,"
4382,OENONE,"the wanderings of Ulysses, the tragedy of Agamemnon, the founding of"
4383,OENONE,"Rome, and the three great epics of the ancient world."""
4384,OENONE,
4385,OENONE,Another point of general interest is to be noted in the poem.  Despite
4386,OENONE,"the classical theme the tone is consistently modern, as may be gathered"
4387,OENONE,"from the philosophy of the speech of Pallas, and from the tender yielding"
4388,OENONE,nature of Oenone.  There is no hint here of the vindictive resentment
4389,OENONE,"which the old classical writers, would have associated with her grief."
4390,OENONE,Similarly Tennyson has systematically modernised the Arthurian legend in
4391,OENONE,"the _Idylls of the King_, giving us nineteenth century thoughts in a"
4392,OENONE,conventional mediaeval setting.
4393,OENONE,
4394,OENONE,"A passage from Bayne, puts this question clearly: ""Oenone wails"
4395,OENONE,melodiously for Paris without the remotest suggestion of fierceness or
4396,OENONE,revengeful wrath.  She does not upbraid him for having preferred to her
4397,OENONE,"the fairest and most loving wife in Greece, but wonders how any one could"
4398,OENONE,love him better than she does.  A Greek poet would have used his whole
4399,OENONE,power of expression to instil bitterness into her resentful words.  The
4400,OENONE,"classic legend, instead of representing Oenone as forgiving Paris, makes"
4401,OENONE,her nurse her wrath throughout all the anguish and terror of the Trojan
4402,OENONE,"War.  At its end, her Paris comes back to her.  Deprived of Helen, a"
4403,OENONE,"broken and baffled man, he returns from the ruins of his native Troy, and"
4404,OENONE,"entreats Oenone to heal him of a wound, which, unless she lends her aid,"

4406,OENONE,"and lets him die.  In the end, no doubt, she falls into remorse, and"
4407,OENONE,kills herself--this is quite in the spirit of classic legend; implacable

4434,OENONE,"22-23. O MOTHER IDA--DIE.  Mr. Stedman, in his _Victorian Poets_, devotes"
4435,OENONE,a valuable chapter to the discussion of Tennyson's relation to
4436,OENONE,"Theocritus, both in sentiment and form.  ""It is in the _Oenone_ that we"
4437,OENONE,"discover Tennyson's earliest adaptation of that refrain, which was a"

4492,OENONE,
4493,OENONE,65. HESPERIAN GOLD.  The fruit was in colour like the golden apples in
4494,OENONE,the garden of the Hesperides.  The Hesperides were three (or four)
4495,OENONE,"nymphs, the daughters of Hesperus.  They dwelt in the remotest west, near"
4496,OENONE,"Mount Atlas in Africa, and were appointed to guard the golden apples"
4497,OENONE,which Herè gave to Zeus on the day of their marriage.  One of Hercules'
4498,OENONE,twelve labours was to procure some of these apples.  See the articles
4499,OENONE,_Hesperides_ and _Hercules_ in Lempriere.
4500,OENONE,
4501,OENONE,66. SMELT AMBROSIALLY.  Ambrosia was the food of the gods.  Their drink
4502,OENONE,"was nectar.  The food was sweeter than honey, and of most fragrant odour."
4503,OENONE,
4504,OENONE,72.  WHATEVER OREAD. A classical construction.  The Oreads were mountain
4505,OENONE,nymphs.
4506,OENONE,
4507,OENONE,"78. FULL-FACED--GODS.  This means either that not a face was missing, or"
4508,OENONE,refers to the impressive countenances of the gods.  Another possible
4509,OENONE,interpretation is that all their faces were turned full towards the board
4510,OENONE,"on which the apple was cast.  Compare for this epithet _Lotos Eaters_, 7;"
4511,OENONE,"and _Princess_, ii. 166."
4512,OENONE,
4513,OENONE,"79. PELEUS.  All the gods, save Eris, were present at the marriage"
4514,OENONE,"between Peleus and Thetis, a sea-deity.  In her anger Eris threw upon the"

4519,OENONE,
4520,OENONE,83. DELIVERING=announcing.
4521,OENONE,
4522,OENONE,"89-100. These lines, and the opening lines of the poem are among the best"
4523,OENONE,"of Tennyson's blank verse lines, and therefore among the best that"
4524,OENONE,English poetry contains.  The description owes some of its beauty to
4525,OENONE,"Homer.  In its earlier form, in the volume of 1832-3, it is much less"
4526,OENONE,perfect.
4527,OENONE,
4528,OENONE,132. A CRESTED PEACOCK.  The peacock was sacred to Herè (Juno).
4529,OENONE,
4530,OENONE,103. A GOLDEN CLOUD.  The gods were wont to recline upon Olympus beneath
4531,OENONE,a canopy of golden clouds.
4532,OENONE,
4533,OENONE,104. DROPPING FRAGRANT DEW.  Drops of glittering dew fell from the golden
4534,OENONE,"cloud which shrouded Herè and Zeus.  See _Iliad_, XIV, 341 f."
4535,OENONE,
4536,OENONE,105 f. Herè was the queen of Heaven.  Power was therefore the gift which
4537,OENONE,she naturally proffered.
4538,OENONE,
4539,OENONE,114. Supply the ellipsis.
4540,OENONE,
4541,OENONE,121-122. POWER FITTED--WISDOM.  Power that adapts itself to every crisis;
4542,OENONE,power which is born of wisdom and enthroned by wisdom (i.e. does not owe
4543,OENONE,its supremacy to brute strength).

4549,OENONE,
4550,OENONE,"The gods, who haunt"
4551,OENONE,The lucid interspace of world and world
4552,OENONE,"Where never creeps a cloud, or moves a wind,"
4553,OENONE,"Nor ever falls the least white star of snow,"
4554,OENONE,Nor ever lowest roll of thunder moans.
4555,OENONE,
4556,OENONE,137. O'ERTHWARTED WITH=crossed by.
4557,OENONE,
4558,OENONE,142 f. Compare the tone of Pallas' speech with what has been said in the
4559,OENONE,"introduction, p. liv f., concerning Tennyson's love of moderation and"
4560,OENONE,"restraint, and his belief in the efficacy of law."
4561,OENONE,
4562,OENONE,Compare also the general temper of the _Ode on the Death of the Duke of
4563,OENONE,"Wellington_, and especially ll. 201-205."
4564,OENONE,
4565,OENONE,144--148. Yet these qualities are not bestowed with power as the end in
4566,OENONE,view.  Power will come without seeking when these great principles of
4567,OENONE,conduct are observed.  The main thing is to live and act by the law of
4568,OENONE,"the higher Life,--and it is the part of wisdom to follow right for its"
4569,OENONE,"own sake, whatever the consequences may be."
4570,OENONE,
4571,OENONE,151. SEQUEL OF GUERDON.  To follow up my words with rewards (such as Herè
4572,OENONE,proffers) would not make me fairer.
4573,OENONE,
4574,OENONE,"153-164. Pallas reads the weakness of Paris's character, but disdains to"
4575,OENONE,offer him a more worldly reward.  An access of moral courage will be her
4576,OENONE,"sole gift to him, so that he shall front danger and disaster until his"
4577,OENONE,"powers of endurance grow strong with action, and his full-grown will"
4578,OENONE,"having passed through all experiences, and having become a pure law unto"
4579,OENONE,"itself, shall be commensurate with perfect freedom, i.e., shall not know"
4580,OENONE,that it is circumscribed by law.
4581,OENONE,
4582,OENONE,This is the philosophy that we find in Wordsworth's _Ode to Duty_.
4583,OENONE,
4584,OENONE,Stern Lawgiver!  Yet thou dost wear
4585,OENONE,The Godhead's most benignant grace;
4586,OENONE,Nor know we anything so fair
4587,OENONE,As is the smile upon thy face:
4588,OENONE,"Flowers laugh before thee on their beds,"
4589,OENONE,And fragrance in thy footing treads;
4590,OENONE,"Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong,"
4591,OENONE,"And the most ancient heavens, through thee,"
4592,OENONE,are fresh and strong.

4594,OENONE,165-167. Note how dramatic this interruption is.
4595,OENONE,
4596,OENONE,170. IDALIAN APHRODITE.  Idalium was a town in Cyprus; an island where
4597,OENONE,the goddess was especially worshipped.  She was frequently called Cypria
4598,OENONE,or the Cyprian.
4599,OENONE,
4600,OENONE,"171. FRESH AS THE FOAM.  Aphrodite was born from the waves of the sea,"
4601,OENONE,near the Island of Cyprus.
4602,OENONE,
4603,OENONE,NEW-BATHED IN PAPHIAN WELLS.  Paphos was a town in Cyprus.  Aphrodite was
4604,OENONE,said to have landed at Paphos after her birth from the sea-foam.  She is
4605,OENONE,sometimes called the Paphian or Paphia on this account.
4606,OENONE,
4607,OENONE,"184.  SHE SPOKE AND LAUGH'D.  Homer calls her ""the laughter-loving"
4608,OENONE,"Aphrodite."""
4609,OENONE,
4610,OENONE,195-l97. A WILD--WEED.  The influence of beauty upon the beasts is a
4611,OENONE,common theme with poets.  Cf. Una and the lion in Spenser's _Faery Queen_.
4612,OENONE,
4613,OENONE,204. THEY CUT AWAY MY TALLEST PINES.  Evidently to make ships for Paris's
4614,OENONE,expedition to Greece.
4615,OENONE,
4616,OENONE,235-240. THERE ARE--DIE.   Lamartine in _Le Lac_ (written before 1820)

4618,OENONE,
4619,OENONE,"250. CASSANDRA.  The daughter of King Priam, and therefore the sister of"

4627,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4628,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"First published, with the epilogue as here printed, in 1842.  The _Morte"
4629,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"d'Arthur_ was subsequently taken out of the present setting, and with"
4630,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,substantial expansion appeared as the final poem of the _Idylls of the
4631,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"King_, with the new title, _The Passing of Arthur_."
4632,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4633,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,Walter Savage Landor doubtless refers to the _Morte d'Arthur_ as early as
4634,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"1837, when writing to a friend, as follows:--""Yesterday a Mr. Moreton, a"
4635,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"young man of rare judgment, read to me a manuscript by Mr. Tennyson,"
4636,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,being different in style from his printed poems.  The subject is the
4637,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Death of Arthur.  It is more Homeric than any poem of our time, and"
4638,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"rivals some of the noblest parts of the Odyssea."" A still earlier"
4639,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,composition is assured by the correspondence of Edward Fitzgerald who
4640,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"writes that, in 1835, while staying at the Speddings in the Lake Country,"
4641,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,he met Tennyson and heard the poet read the _Morte d'Arthur_ and other
4642,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"poems of the 1842 volume.  They were read out of a MS., ""in a little red"
4643,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"book to him and Spedding of a night 'when all the house was mute.'"""
4644,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4645,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,In _The Epic_ we have specific reference to the Homeric influence in
4646,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,these lines:
4647,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4648,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Nay, nay,"" said Hall,"
4649,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Why take the style of those heroic times?"
4650,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For nature brings not back the Mastodon,"
4651,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,Nor we those times; and why should any man
4652,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,Remodel models? these twelve books of mine
4653,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Were faint Homeric echoes, nothing-worth,"" . . ."
4654,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4655,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,Critics have agreed for the most part in considering the _Morte d'Arthur_
4656,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"as the most Homeric of Tennyson's poems.  Bayne writes: ""Not only in the"
4657,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"language is it Homeric, but in the design and manner of treatment.  The"
4658,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"concentration of interest on the hero, the absence of all modernism in"
4659,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the way of love, story or passion painting, the martial clearness,"
4660,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"terseness, brevity of the narrative, with definite specification, at the"
4661,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"same time, are exquisitely true to the Homeric pattern.""  Brimley notes,"
4662,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"with probably greater precision, that: ""They are rather Virgilian than"
4663,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Homeric echoes; elaborate and stately, not naive and eager to tell their"
4664,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,story; rich in pictorial detail; carefully studied; conscious of their
4665,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"own art; more anxious for beauty of workmanship than interest of action."""
4666,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4667,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,It has frequently been pointed out in this book how prone Tennyson is to
4668,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,regard all his subjects from the modern point of view:
4669,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4670,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,a truth
4671,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,Looks freshest in the fashion of the day.
4672,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4673,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,The Epic and the epilogue strongly emphasize this modernity in the varied
4674,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"modern types of character which they represent, with their diverse"
4675,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"opinions upon contemporary topics.  ""As to the epilogue,"" writes Mr."
4676,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Brooke (p. 130), ""it illustrates all I have been saying about Tennyson's"
4677,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,method with subjects drawn from Greek or romantic times.  He filled and
4678,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,sustained those subjects with thoughts which were as modern as they were
4679,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"ancient.  While he placed his readers in Camelot, Ithaca, or Ida, he made"
4680,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"them feel also that they were standing in London, Oxford, or an English"
4681,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"woodland.  When the _Morte d'Arthur_ is finished, the hearer of it sits"
4682,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"rapt.  There were 'modern touches here and there,' he says, and when he"
4683,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,sleeps he dreams of
4684,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4685,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""King Arthur, like a modern gentleman"
4686,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Of stateliest port; and all the people cried,"
4687,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'Arthur is come again, he cannot die.'"
4688,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,Then those that stood upon the hills behind
4689,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Repeated--'Come again, and thrice as fair:'"
4690,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And, further inland, voices echoed--'Come"

4692,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4693,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""The old tale, thus modernised in an epilogue, does not lose its dignity,"
4694,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,for now the recoming of Arthur is the recoming of Christ in a wider and
4695,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,fairer Christianity.  We feel here how the new movement of religion and
4696,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,theology had sent its full and exciting wave into Tennyson.  Arthur's
4697,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,death in the battle and the mist is the death of a form of Christianity
4698,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"which, exhausted, died in doubt and darkness.  His advent as a modern"
4699,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,gentleman is the coming of a brighter and more loving Christ into the
4700,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"hearts of men.  For so ends the epilogue.  When the voices cry, 'Come"

4706,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4707,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,THE ALLEGORICAL ELEMENT.--The statement is made on p. xxxv of this book
4708,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"that in _The Idylls of the King_ ""the effort is made to reconcile the"
4709,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"human story with the allegory, and in consequence the issues are"
4710,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"confusedly presented to our mind.""  It is characteristic of the _Morte"
4711,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,d'Arthur_ fragment that it is apparently free from all allegorical
4712,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,intention.  It is merely a moving human story with a fascinating element
4713,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,of mystery inspired by the original Celtic legend.  An element of
4714,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"allegory lies in the epilogue, and _The Passing of Arthur_ still further"
4715,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"enforces the allegorical purpose.  But here, as Mr. Brooke again writes"
4716,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"(p. 371), ""we are close throughout to the ancient tale.  No allegory, no"
4717,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"ethics, no rational soul, no preaching symbolism, enter here, to dim,"
4718,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"confuse, or spoil the story.  Nothing is added which does not justly"
4719,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"exalt the tale, and what is added is chiefly a greater fulness and"
4720,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"breadth of humanity, a more lovely and supreme Nature, arranged at every"
4721,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,point to enhance into keener life the human feelings of Arthur and his
4722,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"knight, to lift the ultimate hour of sorrow and of death into nobility."

4734,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"figures in it--Sir Bedivere standing by the great water, and Arthur lying"
4735,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"wounded near the chapel, waiting for his knight.  Take one passage, which"
4736,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,to hear is to see the thing:
4737,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4738,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept,"
4739,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,"
4740,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,"
4741,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang"
4742,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Shrill, chill with flakes of foam.  He, stepping down"
4743,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,"
4744,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,Came on the shining levels of the lake.
4745,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4746,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Twice he hides the sword, and when Arthur asks: 'What hast thou seen,"
4747,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,what heard?'  Bedivere answers:
4748,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4749,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""'I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,"

4759,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,"
4760,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,Seen where the moving isles of winter shock

4767,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"where the sound echoes the sense, and Bedivere, carrying Arthur, clangs"
4768,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"as he moves among the icy rocks, is as clear a piece of ringing, smiting,"
4769,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,clashing sound as any to be found in Tennyson:

4782,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""And on a sudden lo! the level lake,"

4789,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"King, the excuses of the Knight, the sorrow and the final wrath of"
4790,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Arthur, are worthy of the landscape, as they ought to be; and the"
4791,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,dominance of the human element in the scene is a piece of noble
4792,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"artist-work.  Arthur is royal to the close, and when he passes away with"
4793,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the weeping Queens across the mere, unlike the star of the tournament he"
4794,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"was of old, he is still the King.  Sir Bedivere, left alone on the"
4795,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"freezing shore, hears the King give his last message to the world.  It is"
4796,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"a modern Christian who speaks, but the phrases do not sound out of"
4797,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,"harmony with that which might be in Romance.  Moreover, the end of the"

4803,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,has been said that the reading of Milton's _Lycidas_ is the surest test
4804,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,of one's powers of poetical appreciation.  I fear that the test is too
4805,THE EPIC AND MORTE D'ARTHUR,severe for many readers who can still enjoy a simpler style of poetry.

4833,MORTE D'ARTHUR,THE ARTHURIAN LEGEND.  Throughout the mediaeval period three great cycles
4834,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"of stories commanded the imagination of the poets.  Of these cycles one,"
4835,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the tale of Troy in its curious mediaeval guise, attested the potent"
4836,MORTE D'ARTHUR,spell of antique legend.[1] The two other great cycles were of later
4837,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"origin, and centred around the commanding historical figures of"
4838,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Charlemagne, and the phantom glory of the legendary Arthur."
4839,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4840,MORTE D'ARTHUR,[1]The extraordinary interest in the half legendary career of Alexander
4841,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the Great must be noticed here, as also the profound respect amounting to"
4842,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"veneration for the Roman poet, Vergil."
4843,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4844,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4845,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The origin of the Arthurian story is involved in obscurity.  The crudest
4846,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"form of the myth has doubtless a core of historic truth, and represents"
4847,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"him as a mighty Celtic warrior, who works havoc among the heathen Saxon"
4848,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"invaders.  Accretions naturally are added, and a miraculous origin and a"
4849,MORTE D'ARTHUR,mysterious death throw a superstitious halo around the hero.  When the
4850,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"brilliant personality of Lancelot breaks into the tale, and the legend of"
4851,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the Holy Grail is superadded, the theme exercised an irresistible"
4852,MORTE D'ARTHUR,fascination upon the imagination of mediaeval Europe.
4853,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4854,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The vicissitudes of the Celtic inhabitants of Britain are as romantic as
4855,MORTE D'ARTHUR,any of which history holds record.  After the departure of the Roman
4856,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"invaders from the island, the native population swiftly reasserted"
4857,MORTE D'ARTHUR,itself.  The Picts of Caledonia and the Scots of Ireland were their
4858,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"natural foes, but conflict with these enemies served only to stimulate"
4859,MORTE D'ARTHUR,the national life.  But actual disaster threatened them when in the fifth
4860,MORTE D'ARTHUR,and sixth centuries the heathen Angles and Saxons bore down in
4861,MORTE D'ARTHUR,devastating hordes upon the land.  It is at this critical period in the
4862,MORTE D'ARTHUR,national history that Arthur must have lived.  How long or how valiant
4863,MORTE D'ARTHUR,the resistance was we cannot know.  That it was vain is certain.  A large
4864,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"body of Britons fled from annihilation across the channel, and founded in"
4865,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the region of Armurica in France, a new Brittany.  Meanwhile, in the"
4866,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"older Britain, the foe pressed hard upon their fellow-countrymen, and"
4867,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"drove them into the western limits of the island, into the fastnesses of"
4868,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Wales, and the rocky parts of Cornwall.  Here, and in Northern France,"
4869,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"proud in their defeat and tenacious of the instincts of their race, they"
4870,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"lived and still live, in the imaginative memories of the past.  For them"
4871,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the future held little store of earthly gain, and yet they made the whole"
4872,MORTE D'ARTHUR,world their debtor.
4873,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4874,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Even in the courts of the conqueror Saxon their strange and beautiful
4875,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"poetry won favour, and in a later century the Norman kings and barons"
4876,MORTE D'ARTHUR,welcomed eagerly the wandering minstrels from Brittany and Wales.  But it
4877,MORTE D'ARTHUR,was not from these scattered sources that Celtic traditions became a
4878,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"European possession, as a brief statement of literary history will"
4879,MORTE D'ARTHUR,clearly show.
4880,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4881,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The first recorded mention of Arthur's name occurs in a brief and
4882,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"anonymous _History of the Britons_, written in Latin in the tenth"
4883,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"century, and attributed to Nennius.  This history is curiously amplified"
4884,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"in the twelfth century by Geoffrey of Monmouth, first in a story dealing"
4885,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"with the prophecies of Merlin, and later in a _History of the Kings of"
4886,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Britain_.  This book, with its brilliant description of the court of"
4887,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Arthur, gave the legend a widespread popularity.  It was four times"
4888,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"within the same century translated into French verse, the most famous of"
4889,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"these renderings being the version of Wace, called _Le Brut_, which makes"
4890,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"some addition to Geoffrey's original, gathered from Breton sources.  In"
4891,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the same century, too, Chrétien de Troyes, the foremost of Arthurian"
4892,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"poets, composed his famous cycle of poems."
4893,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4894,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Of all these manifold sources Tennyson was confessedly ignorant.  Where
4895,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the details are not of his own invention, his _Idylls of the King_ rest"
4896,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"entirely upon Malory's _Morte d'Arthur_, which Caxton printed in 1485,"
4897,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"supplemented in the case of _Enid and Geraint_, and _The Marriage of"
4898,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Geraint_ by a translation of the Welsh _Mabinogion_ by Lady Charlotte

4902,MORTE D'ARTHUR,THE STORY OF THE IDYLLS.--It is well to remember the events that led up
4903,MORTE D'ARTHUR,to Arthur's death.  Guinevere's guilty love for Lancelot had been
4904,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"discovered and revealed by Arthur's nephew, the traitor Modred.  The"
4905,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Queen fled the court and sought refuge with the nuns of Almesbury.
4906,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Lancelot fled to his castle in the north, where the King in vain besieged"
4907,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"him.  Meanwhile Modred had stirred up a revolt, and leaguing himself with"
4908,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the Saxon invaders, had usurped Arthur's throne.  On his march southward"
4909,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"to resist his nephew, Arthur halts at the nunnery of Almesbury, and in"
4910,MORTE D'ARTHUR,the Guinevere idyll the moving story of their last farewell is told.
4911,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then the King advanced to meet Modred.  The description of that ""last"
4912,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"weird battle in the west"" is given in _The Passing of Arthur_, and leads"
4913,MORTE D'ARTHUR,up to the impressive line with which our present poem opens.  Towards the
4914,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"close of that fateful day, there came--"
4915,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4916,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew"
4917,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"The mist aside, and with that wind the tide"
4918,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field"
4919,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Of battle: but no man was moving there;
4920,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon,"
4921,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave
4922,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Broke in among dead faces, to and fro"
4923,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down"
4924,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen,"
4925,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And shiver'd brands that once had fought with Rome,"
4926,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And rolling far along the gloomy shores
4927,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The voice of days of old and days to be.
4928,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4929,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"The King speaks despairingly to Bedivere, who answering, swears to him"
4930,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"undying allegiance, and points to the traitor, Modred, who still stands"
4931,MORTE D'ARTHUR,unharmed:
4932,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4933,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Thereupon:--
4934,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4935,MORTE D'ARTHUR,the King
4936,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Made at the man: then Modred smote his liege
4937,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Hard on the helm which many a heathen sword
4938,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow,"
4939,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Striking the last stroke with Excalibur,"
4940,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell."
4941,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4942,MORTE D'ARTHUR,4. LYONNESSE.  The geography of the _Idylls of the King_ is designedly
4943,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"vague.  The region of Lyonnesse was supposed to be adjacent to Cornwall,"
4944,MORTE D'ARTHUR,and the sea now covers it.  The Scilly Islands are held to have been the
4945,MORTE D'ARTHUR,western limit of this fabulous country.
4946,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4947,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"6. THE BOLD SIR BEDIVERE.  The epithet ""bold"" is used repeatedly in this"
4948,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"vaguely descriptive fashion with Sir Bedivere's name.  Cf. lines 39, 69,"
4949,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"115, 151, 226.  The use of ""permanent epithets"" in narrative poetry has"
4950,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"been consecrated by the example of Homer, who constantly employs such"
4951,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"expressions as ""the swift-footed Achilles,"" ""wide-ruling Agamemnon,"" etc."
4952,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4953,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Bedivere is described in _The Coming of Arthur_ as follows:--
4954,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4955,MORTE D'ARTHUR,For bold in heart and act and word was he
4956,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Whenever slander breathed against the King.
4957,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4958,MORTE D'ARTHUR,12. A GREAT WATER.  This expression has occasioned much unnecessary
4959,MORTE D'ARTHUR,comment on the score of its alleged artificiality.  There might be a gain
4960,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"in definiteness in substituting ""lake,"" or ""river,"" as the case might be,"
4961,MORTE D'ARTHUR,but there would be a corresponding loss in poetry and in meaning at this
4962,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"particular place.  ""Had 'a great lake' been substituted for it, the"
4963,MORTE D'ARTHUR,phrase would have needed to be translated by the mind into water of a
4964,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"certain shape and size, before the picture was realized by the"
4965,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"imagination."" (Brimley.) It would have, consequently, been more precise,"
4966,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"but ""less poetic and pictorial."""
4967,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4968,MORTE D'ARTHUR,If further justification for the expression were needed it might be
4969,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"stated that ""water"" stands for lake in certain parts of England, e.g."
4970,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Dewentwater,"" etc.; and, what is of more importance, that Malory uses"
4971,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""water"" in the same sense: ""The king . . . . saw afore him in a great"

4975,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"speaking of the allegorical meaning of _The Idylls of the King_, Tennyson"
4976,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"states that ""Camelot, for instance, a city of shadowy palaces, is"
4977,MORTE D'ARTHUR,everywhere symbolical of the gradual growth of human beliefs and
4978,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"institutions, and of the spiritual development of man.""  Always bear in"
4979,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"mind that Tennyson has also said: ""There is no single fact or incident in"
4980,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the Idylls, however seemingly mystical, which cannot be explained without"
4981,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"any mystery or allegory whatever."""
4982,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4983,MORTE D'ARTHUR,22. I PERISH--MADE.  In _The Coming of Arthur_ this thought is amplified:
4984,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4985,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For first Aurelius lived and fought and died,"
4986,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And after him King Uther fought and died,"
4987,MORTE D'ARTHUR,But either failed to make the kingdom one.
4988,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And after these King Arthur for a space,"
4989,MORTE D'ARTHUR,_And thro the puissance of his Table Round
4990,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Drew all their petty princedoms under him,"
4991,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Their king and head, and made a realm, and reigned_."
4992,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4993,MORTE D'ARTHUR,And in _The Passing of Arthur_ we read:
4994,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4995,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Ill doom is mine
4996,MORTE D'ARTHUR,To war against my people and my knights.
4997,MORTE D'ARTHUR,The king who fights his people fights himself.
4998,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
4999,MORTE D'ARTHUR,23. THO' MERLINE SWARE--AGAIN.  Merlin was the great wizard of Arthur's
5000,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"court.  In the allegorical view of the poem he typifies the intellect,"
5001,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"or, in Tennyson's words: ""the sceptical understanding."""
5002,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
5003,MORTE D'ARTHUR,This prophecy concerning Arthur is again referred to in _The Coming of
5004,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Arthur_:
5005,MORTE D'ARTHUR,

5008,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Though men may wound him, that he will not die,"
5009,MORTE D'ARTHUR,But pass and come again.
5010,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
5011,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"This belief is common to all the Arthurian sources.  Compare, for"
5012,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"example, Wace's _Brut_: ""Arthur, if the story lies not, was mortally"
5013,MORTE D'ARTHUR,wounded in the body: he had himself borne to Avalon to heal his wounds.
5014,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"There he is still; the Britons await him, as they say and"
5015,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"understand . . .  The prophet spoke truth, and one can doubt, and always"
5016,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"will doubt whether he is dead or living.""  Dr. Sykes writes that, ""The"
5017,MORTE D'ARTHUR,sleep of Arthur associates the British story with the similar stories of
5018,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Charlemagne and Frederick Barbarossa of Germany, Brian in Ireland,"

5034,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
5035,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"It has been variously held that Excalibur typifies temporal authority, or"
5036,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"spiritual power.  The casting away of the sword, therefore, represents"
5037,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the inevitable change in which human things are involved, and even faith"
5038,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"itself.  Compare _Morte d'Arthur_, ll. 240-241."

5057,MORTE D'ARTHUR,63. MANY-KNOTTED WATER FLAGS.  Dr. Sykes has a careful note on this
5058,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"expression (_Select Poems of Tennyson_; Gage & Co.).  ""The epithet"
5059,MORTE D'ARTHUR,many-knotted is difficult to explain.  The possible explanations would
5060,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"refer the description to (1) the root-stock of the flag, which shows"
5061,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"additional bulbs from year to year; (2) the joints in the flower stalks,"
5062,MORTE D'ARTHUR,of which some half-dozen may be found on each stalk; (3) the large
5063,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"seed-pods that terminate in stalks, a very noticeable feature when the"
5064,MORTE D'ARTHUR,plant is sere; (4) the various bunches or knots of iris in a bed of the
5065,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"plants, so that the whole phrase suggests a thickly matted bed of flags."
5066,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"I favour the last interpretation, though Tennyson's fondness of technical"
5067,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"accuracy in his references makes the second more than possible."""
5068,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
5069,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"70-71. I HEARD--CRAG.  It is interesting to read Chapter V., Book XXI. of"
5070,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Malory in connection with Tennyson's version of the story.  He is

5072,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"70-71, we find in Malory: ""What saw thou, there?"" said the King.  ""Sir,"""
5073,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"he said, ""I saw nothing but the waters wap and the waves wan.""  Tennyson,"

5081,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"by the way he beheld that noble sword, that the pommel and haft were all"
5082,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"of precious stones, and then he said to himself, 'If I throw this rich"

5087,MORTE D'ARTHUR,at the crowning of Arthur.  In the _Coming of Arthur_ she is described as
5088,MORTE D'ARTHUR,dwelling--
5089,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
5090,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Down in a deep; calm, whatsoever storms"
5091,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"May shake the world, and when the surface rolls"

5093,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
5094,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Arthur's first meeting with her is described in Malory:-- ""So they rode"
5095,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"till they came to a lake, the which was a fair water and broad, and in"
5096,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm clothed in white samite,"
5097,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"that held a fair sword in that hand.  'Lo,' said Merlin, 'yonder is that"

5099,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'What damsel is that?' said Arthur.  'That is the Lady of the Lake,' said"
5100,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Merlin; 'and within that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place"

5106,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"105-106. NINE YEARS--HILLS.  Hallam, Lord Tennyson, in the Memoir, quotes"
5107,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Fitzgerald's short account of a row on Lake Windermere with the poet;
5108,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""'Resting on our oars one calm day on Windermere, whither we had gone for"
5109,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"a week from dear Spedding's (Mirehouse), at the end of May, 1835; resting"

5111,MORTE D'ARTHUR,quoted from the lines he had lately read us from the MS. of _Morte

5127,MORTE D'ARTHUR,121. AUTHORITY--KING.  This line has been described as Shakespearian.
5128,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Its strength is derived from the force of the metaphorical
5129,MORTE D'ARTHUR,personification.  The boldness of the poetical construction is carried
5130,MORTE D'ARTHUR,into the metaphor in the next line.

5137,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Webb's edition it is suggested that 'with my hands' is added for one of
5138,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"two reasons,--either ""because he had now no sword; or more probably,"
5139,MORTE D'ARTHUR,these words are introduced in imitation of Homer's habit of mentioning
5140,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"specific details: cf. 'he went taking long steps with his feet.'"" This"
5141,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"explanation is ingenious, but unnecessary in view of the quotation from"
5142,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Malory.  The note proceeds: ""Notice the touch of human personality in the"
5143,MORTE D'ARTHUR,king's sharp anger; otherwise Arthur is generally represented by Tennyson
5144,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"as a rather colourless being, and as almost 'too good for human nature's"

5147,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"133-142.  Brimley in his valuable essay on Tennyson, analyses this poem"
5148,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"in some detail.  Of this passage he writes: ""A series of brilliant"
5149,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"effects is hit off in these two words, 'made lightnings.'  'Whirl'd in an"
5150,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"arch,' is a splendid instance of sound answering to sense, which the"
5151,MORTE D'ARTHUR,older critics made so much of; the additional syllable which breaks the
5152,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"measure, and necessitates an increased rapidity of utterance, seeming to"
5153,MORTE D'ARTHUR,express to the ear the rush of the sword up its parabolic curve.  And
5154,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"with what lavish richness of presentative power is the boreal aurora, the"
5155,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"collision, the crash, and the thunder of the meeting icebergs, brought"
5156,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"before the eye.  An inferior artist would have shouted through a page,"
5157,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"and emptied a whole pallet of colour, without any result but interrupting"
5158,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"his narrative, where Tennyson in three lines strikingly illustrates the"
5159,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"fact he has to tell,--associates it impressively with one of Nature's"
5160,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"grandest phenomena, and gives a complete picture of this phenomenon"

5200,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"said the King, 'help me hence, for I dread me I have tarried over long.'"
5201,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Then Sir Bedivere took the King upon his back, and so went with him to"
5202,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"that water side.  And when they were at the water side, even fast by the"
5203,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"bank hoved a little barge, with many fair ladies in it, and among them"
5204,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"all was a queen, and all they had black hoods, and all they wept and"
5205,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"shrieked when they saw King Arthur.  'Now, put me into the barge,' said"
5206,MORTE D'ARTHUR,the King: and so they did softly.  And there received him three queens
5207,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"with great mourning, and so they set him down, and in one of their laps"
5208,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"King Arthur laid his head; and then that queen said; 'Ah, dear brother,"
5209,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"why have ye tarried so long from me?  Alas, this wound on your head hath"
5210,MORTE D'ARTHUR,caught overmuch cold.'  And so then they rowed from the land; and Sir
5211,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Bedivere beheld ail those ladies go from him.  Then Sir Bedivere cried;
5212,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'Ah, my Lord Arthur, what shall become of me now ye so from me, and leave"
5213,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"me here alone among mine enemies?'  'Comfort thyself,' said the King:,"
5214,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"'and do as well as thou mayest, for in me is no trust for to trust in."
5215,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"For I will into the vale of Avilion, to heal me of my grievous wound."
5216,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"And if thou hear never more of me, pray for my soul.'  But ever the"

5218,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"as soon as Sir Bedivere had lost the sight of the barge, he wept and"

5220,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
5221,MORTE D'ARTHUR,It is interesting to note how the poet suggests here and there the

5223,MORTE D'ARTHUR,amplifications.  It may be doubted whether Tennyson has here surpassed
5224,MORTE D'ARTHUR,his original.  For its touching simplicity he has substituted a dignified
5225,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"grandeur, and has involved plain statements in gorgeous rhetoric, as in"
5226,MORTE D'ARTHUR,his passage upon the efficacy of prayer.  The unadorned original had said

5252,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Their very intellectuality is alien to the spirit of the original.  In

5268,MORTE D'ARTHUR,259. THE ISLAND VALLEY OF AVILION.  Mr. Rhys in his _Studies in the
5269,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Arthurian Legend_ combats the old idea that Avalon (Avilion) meant the
5270,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"""Island of Apples"" (Welsh aval, apple).  The name implies the Island of"
5271,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"King Avalon, a Celtic divinity, who presided among the dead."
5272,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
5273,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"The valley of Avalon was supposed to be near Glastonbury, in"

5275,MORTE D'ARTHUR,
5276,MORTE D'ARTHUR,67 ff.  There is an evident symbolical meaning in this dream.  Indeed
5277,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Tennyson always appears to use dreams for purposes of symbol.  The lines
5278,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"are an application of the expression; ""The old order changeth,"" etc.  The"
5279,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"parson's lamentation expressed in line 18, ""Upon the general decay of"
5280,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"faith,"" is also directly answered by the assertion that the modern Arthur"
5281,MORTE D'ARTHUR,will arise in modern times.  There is a certain grotesqueness in the
5282,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"likening of King Arthur to ""a modern gentleman of stateliest port.""  But"
5283,MORTE D'ARTHUR,Tennyson never wanders far from conditions of his own time.  As Mr.
5284,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"Stopford Brooke writes; ""Arthur, as the modern gentleman, as the modern"
5285,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"ruler of men, such a ruler as one of our Indian heroes on the frontier,"
5286,MORTE D'ARTHUR,"is the main thing in Tennyson's mind, and his conception of such a man"

5327,THE BROOK,Shakespeare:
5328,THE BROOK,
5329,THE BROOK,As imagination bodies forth
5330,THE BROOK,"The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen"
5331,THE BROOK,"Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing"
5332,THE BROOK,A local habitation and a name.
5333,THE BROOK,"--_Midsummer Night's Dream_, V., 1."
5334,THE BROOK,
5335,THE BROOK,17. HALF-ENGLISH NEILGHERRY AIR.  The Neilgherry Hills are in Madras.
5336,THE BROOK,The climate resembles somewhat that of England.

5338,THE BROOK,"37. MORE IVY, i.e. than twenty years ago."
5339,THE BROOK,
5340,THE BROOK,46. WILLOW WEED AND MALLOW.  These are marsh plants.
5341,THE BROOK,
5342,THE BROOK,93-95. NOT ILLITERATE--DEED.  Katie was not without reading; but she was
5343,THE BROOK,not of those who dabble in sentimental novels (the source of imaginary
5344,THE BROOK,"tears), and saturate themselves with unctuous charities; and whose powers"
5345,THE BROOK,to act are sapped by their excess of feeling.
5346,THE BROOK,
5347,THE BROOK,105. UNCLAIM'D.  As having nothing to do with her.  Katie resented the
5348,THE BROOK,implication in the question of line 100.  She therefore disdained to
5349,THE BROOK,answer it.  Messrs. Rowe and Webb hold that line 100 is a hint that the
5350,THE BROOK,"speaker, Lawrence Aylmer, was responsible for James's fit of jealousy."
5351,THE BROOK,
5352,THE BROOK,l25f. Note the art with which the old man's garrulousness is expressed.
5353,THE BROOK,The cautious precision of lines 151-152 is particularly apt.
5354,THE BROOK,
5355,THE BROOK,176. NETTED SUNBEAM.  The sunlight reflected like a net-work on the
5356,THE BROOK,bottom.  The ripples on the surface would have this effect.
5357,THE BROOK,
5358,THE BROOK,189. ARNO.  A river in Italy which flows past Florence.
5359,THE BROOK,
5360,THE BROOK,189-190. DOME OF BRUNELLESCHI.  Brunelleschi (Broo-nei-les'-ké) was an
5361,THE BROOK,"Italian architect (1377-1444), who completed the cathedral of Santa Maria"
5362,THE BROOK,in Florence.  Its dome is of great size and impressiveness.
5363,THE BROOK,
5364,THE BROOK,194. BY--SEAS.  Tennyson was fond of quoting this line as one of his
5365,THE BROOK,roost successful individual lines.  Its rhythm is indeed sonorous.
5366,THE BROOK,
5367,THE BROOK,195-196. AND HOLD--APRIL AUTUMNS.  Objection has been taken to the
5368,THE BROOK,"somewhat pedantic precision of these lines.  See, however, the reference"
5369,THE BROOK,on pp. lxxii.-lxxvii. to Tennyson's employment of science in poetry.

5379,IN MEMORIAM,
5380,IN MEMORIAM,"The poem, _In Memoriam_, in memory of Arthur Henry Hallam, was published"
5381,IN MEMORIAM,"in 1850, at first anonymously, but the authorship was not long in doubt."
5382,IN MEMORIAM,
5383,IN MEMORIAM,"Arthur Henry Hallam, the son of Henry Hallam, the historian, was born in"
5384,IN MEMORIAM,"1811.  He entered Eton in 1822, and remained there until 1827, when he"
5385,IN MEMORIAM,"went to Cambridge.  There he met Alfred Tennyson, and the two young men"
5386,IN MEMORIAM,"formed a friendship for one another, broken only by Hallam's early death."
5387,IN MEMORIAM,"In 1832, he graduated from Cambridge, became engaged to Emily Tennyson,"
5388,IN MEMORIAM,"the sister of Alfred, and entered on the study of law.  In 1833, he had a"
5389,IN MEMORIAM,severe illness and after his recovery was taken by his father for a tour
5390,IN MEMORIAM,"on the Continent, in the hope of restoring his health.  Sir Francis"
5391,IN MEMORIAM,"Hastings Doyle tells the story of his death: ""A severe bout of influenza"
5392,IN MEMORIAM,"weakened him, and whilst he was travelling abroad for change of air, and"
5393,IN MEMORIAM,"to recover his strength, one of his usual attacks apparently returned"
5394,IN MEMORIAM,"upon him without warning, whilst he was still unfitted to resist it; so"
5395,IN MEMORIAM,that when his poor father came back from a walk through the streets of
5396,IN MEMORIAM,"Vienna, he was lying dead on the sofa where he had been left to take a"
5397,IN MEMORIAM,"short rest.  Mr. Hallam sat down to write his letters, and it was only by"
5398,IN MEMORIAM,"slow and imperceptible degrees that a certain anxiety, in consequence of"
5399,IN MEMORIAM,"Arthur's stillness and silence, dawned upon his mind; he drew near to"
5400,IN MEMORIAM,"ascertain why he had not moved nor spoken, and found that all was over."""
5401,IN MEMORIAM,"The body was brought back to England and buried in Clevedon Church, on"
5402,IN MEMORIAM,the banks of the Severn.
5403,IN MEMORIAM,
5404,IN MEMORIAM,The effect upon Tennyson of the death of Arthur Hallam was overwhelming.
5405,IN MEMORIAM,"For a time it ""blotted out all joy from his life and made him long for"
5406,IN MEMORIAM,"death, in spite of his feeling that he was in some measure a help and"
5407,IN MEMORIAM,"comfort to his sister.""  Under the influence of this great sorrow he"
5408,IN MEMORIAM,"wrote _The Two Voices_, _Ulysses_, ""_Break, Break, Break_,"" and began"
5409,IN MEMORIAM,"that exquisite series of lyric poems, afterwards joined together in the"
5410,IN MEMORIAM,_In Memoriam_.  His friendship for Hallam remained throughout life with
5411,IN MEMORIAM,him as one of his most precious possessions.
5412,IN MEMORIAM,
5413,IN MEMORIAM,"The poems in the text are selected from the _In Memoriam_, and have a"
5414,IN MEMORIAM,"more or less close connection with each other.  It is better, however, to"
5415,IN MEMORIAM,"regard each poem as a separate poem, without any attempt to place it in"
5416,IN MEMORIAM,its relation to the _In Memoriam_ as a whole.
5417,IN MEMORIAM,
5418,IN MEMORIAM,The best annotated edition of _In Memoriam_ is that by A. C. Bradley
