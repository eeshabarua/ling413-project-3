47,I.,I.
48,I.,
49,I.,1.
50,I.,"I hate the dreadful hollow behind the little wood,"
51,I.,"Its lips in the field above are dabbled with blood-red heath,"
52,I.,"The red-ribb'd ledges drip with a silent horror of blood,"
53,I.,"And Echo there, whatever is ask'd her, answers 'Death.'"
54,I.,
55,I.,2.
56,I.,"For there in the ghastly pit long since a body was found,"
57,I.,His who had given me life--O father! O God! was it well?--
58,I.,"Mangled, and flatten'd, and crush'd, and dinted into the ground:"
59,I.,There yet lies the rock that fell with him when he fell.
60,I.,
61,I.,3.
62,I.,"Did he fling himself down? who knows? for a vast speculation had fail'd,"
63,I.,"And ever he mutter'd and madden'd, and ever wann'd with despair,"
64,I.,"And out he walk'd when the wind like a broken worldling wail'd,"
65,I.,And the flying gold of the ruin'd woodlands drove thro' the air.
66,I.,
67,I.,4.
68,I.,"I remember the time, for the roots of my hair were stirr'd"
69,I.,"By a shuffled step, by a dead weight trail'd, by a whisper'd fright,"
70,I.,And my pulses closed their gates with a shock on my heart as I heard
71,I.,The shrill-edged shriek of a mother divide the shuddering night.
72,I.,
73,I.,5.
74,I.,"Villainy somewhere! whose? One says, we are villains all."
75,I.,Not he: his honest fame should at least by me be maintained:
76,I.,"But that old man, now lord of the broad estate and the Hall,"
77,I.,Dropt off gorged from a scheme that had left us flaccid and drain'd.
78,I.,
79,I.,6.
80,I.,"Why do they prate of the blessings of Peace? we have made them a curse,"
81,I.,"Pickpockets, each hand lusting for all that is not its own;"
82,I.,"And lust of gain, in the spirit of Cain, is it better or worse"
83,I.,Than the heart of the citizen hissing in war on his own hearthstone?
84,I.,
85,I.,7.
86,I.,"But these are the days of advance, the works of the men of mind,"
87,I.,When who but a fool would have faith in a tradesman's ware or his word?
88,I.,"Is it peace or war? Civil war, as I think, and that of a kind"
89,I.,"The viler, as underhand, not openly bearing the sword."
90,I.,
91,I.,8.
92,I.,Sooner or later I too may passively take the print
93,I.,Of the golden age-- why not? I have neither hope nor trust;
94,I.,"May make my heart as a millstone, set my face as a flint,"
95,I.,"Cheat and be cheated, and die: who knows? we are ashes and dust."
96,I.,
97,I.,9.
98,I.,"Peace sitting under her olive, and slurring the days gone by,"
99,I.,"When the poor are hovell'd and hustled together, each sex, like swine,"
100,I.,"When only the ledger lives, and when only not all men lie;"
101,I.,Peace in her vineyard--yes!â€“-but a company forges the wine.
102,I.,
103,I.,10.
104,I.,"And the vitriol madness flushes up in the ruffian's head,"
105,I.,"Till the filthy by-lane rings to the yell of the trampled wife,"
106,I.,"While chalk and alum and plaster are sold to the poor for bread,"
107,I.,And the spirit of murder works in the very means of life.
108,I.,
109,I.,11.
110,I.,"And Sleep must lie down arm'd, for the villainous centre-bits"
111,I.,"Grind on the wakeful ear in the hush of the moonless nights,"
112,I.,"While another is cheating the sick of a few last gasps, as he sits"
113,I.,To pestle a poison'd poison behind his crimson lights.
114,I.,
115,I.,12.
116,I.,"When a Mammonite mother kills her babe for a burial fee,"
117,I.,"And Timour-Mammon grins on a pile of children's bones,"
118,I.,"Is it peace or war? better, war! loud war by land and by sea,"
119,I.,"War with a thousand battles, and shaking a hundred thrones."
120,I.,
121,I.,13.
122,I.,"For I trust if an enemy's fleet came yonder round by the hill,"
123,I.,"And the rushing battle-bolt sang from the three-decker out of the foam,"
124,I.,"That the smoothfaced snubnosed rogue would leap from his counter and till,"
125,I.,"And strike, if he could, were it but with his cheating yardwand, home.------"
126,I.,
127,I.,14.
128,I.,What! am I raging alone as my father raged in his mood?
129,I.,Must _I_ too creep to the hollow and dash myself down and die
130,I.,"Rather than hold by the law that I made, nevermore to brood"
131,I.,On a horror of shatter'd limbs and a wretched swindler's lie?
132,I.,
133,I.,15.
134,I.,"Would there be sorrow for _me?_ there was _love_ in the passionate shriek,"
135,I.,Love for the silent thing that had made false haste to the grave--
136,I.,"Wrapt in a cloak, as I saw him, and thought he would rise and speak"
137,I.,"And rave at the lie and the liar, ah God, as he used to rave."
138,I.,
139,I.,16.
140,I.,"I am sick of the Hall and the hill, I am sick of the moor and the main."
141,I.,Why should I stay? can a sweeter chance ever come to me here?
142,I.,"O, having the nerves of motion as well as the nerves of pain,"
143,I.,Were it not wise if I fled from the place and the pit and the fear?
144,I.,
145,I.,17.
146,I.,There are workmen up at the Hall: they are coming back from abroad;
147,I.,The dark old place will be gilt by the touch of a millionnaire:
148,I.,"I have heard, I know not whence, of the singular beauty of Maud;"
149,I.,I play*d with the girl when a child; she promised then to be fair.
150,I.,
151,I.,18.
152,I.,"Maud with her venturous climbings and tumbles and childish escapes,"
153,I.,"Maud the delight of the village, the ringing joy of the Hall,"
154,I.,"Maud with her sweet purse-mouth when my father dangled the grapes,"
155,I.,"Maud the beloved of my mother, the moon-faced darling of all,--"
156,I.,
157,I.,19.
158,I.,What is she now? My dreams are bad. She may bring me a curse.
159,I.,"No, there is fatter game on the moor; she will let me alone."
160,I.,"Thanks, for the fiend best knows whether woman or man be the worse."
161,I.,"I will bury myself in my books, and the Devil may pipe to his own."
162,I.,
163,I.,
164,II.,II.
165,II.,
166,II.,Long have I sigh'd for a calm: God grant I may find it at last!
167,II.,"It will never be broken by Maud, she has neither savour nor salt,"
168,II.,"But a cold and clear-cut face, as I found when her carriage past,"
169,II.,Perfectly beautiful: let it be granted her: where is the fault?
170,II.,"All that I saw (for her eyes were downcast, not to be seen)"
171,II.,"Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null,"
172,II.,"Dead perfection, no more; nothing more, if it had not been"
173,II.,"For a chance of travel, a paleness, an hour's defect of the rose,"
174,II.,"Or an underlip, you may call it a little too ripe, too full,"
175,II.,"Or the least little delicate aquiline curve in a sensitive nose,"
176,II.,"From which I escaped heart-free, with the least little touch of spleen."
177,II.,
178,II.,
179,III.,III.
180,III.,
181,III.,"Cold and clear-cut face, why come you so cruelly meek,"
182,III.,"Breaking a slumber in which all spleenful folly was drown'd,"
183,III.,"Pale with the golden beam of an eyelash dead on the cheek,"
184,III.,"Passionless, pale, cold face, star-sweet on a gloom profound;"
185,III.,"Womanlike, taking revenge too deep for a transient wrong"
186,III.,"Done but in thought to your beauty, and ever as pale as before"
187,III.,Growing and fading and growing upon me without a sound.
188,III.,"Luminous, gemlike, ghostlike, deathlike, half the night long"
189,III.,"Growing and fading and growing, till I could bear it no more."
190,III.,"But arose, and all by myself in my own dark garden ground,"
191,III.,"Listening now to the tide in its broad-flung shipwrecking roar,"
192,III.,"Now to the scream of a madden'd beach dragg'd down by the wave,"
193,III.,"Walk'd in a wintry wind by a ghastly glimmer, and found"
194,III.,"The shining daffodil dead, and Orion low in his grave."
195,III.,
196,III.,
197,IV.,IV.
198,IV.,
199,IV.,1.
200,IV.,A million emeralds break from the ruby-budded lime
201,IV.,"In the little grove where I sit--ah, wherefore cannot I be"
202,IV.,"Like things of the season gay, like the bountiful season bland,"
203,IV.,"When the far-off sail is blown by the breeze of a softer clime,"
204,IV.,Half-lost in the liquid azure bloom of a crescent of sea.
205,IV.,The silent sapphire-spangled marriage ring of the land?
206,IV.,
207,IV.,2.
208,IV.,"Below me, there, is the village, and looks how quiet and small!"
209,IV.,"And yet bubbles o'er like a city, with gossip, scandal, and spite;"
210,IV.,And Jack on his ale-house bench has as many lies as a Czar;
211,IV.,"And here on the landward side, by a red rock, glimmers the Hall;"
212,IV.,And up in the high Hall-garden I see her pass like a light;
213,IV.,But sorrow seize me if ever that light be my leading star!
214,IV.,
215,IV.,3.
216,IV.,"When have I bow'd to her father, the wrinkled head of the race?"
217,IV.,"I met her to-day with her brother, but not to her brother I bow'd;"
218,IV.,I bow'd to his lady-sister as she rode by on the moor;
219,IV.,But the fire of a foolish pride flash'd over her beautiful face.
220,IV.,"O child, you wrong your beauty, believe it, in being so proud;"
221,IV.,"Your father has wealth well-gotten, and I am nameless and poor."
222,IV.,
223,IV.,4.
224,IV.,"I keep but a man and a maid, ever ready to slander and steal;"
225,IV.,"I know it, and smile a hard-set smile, like a stoic, or like"
226,IV.,"A wiser epicurean, and let the world have its way:"
227,IV.,"For nature is one with rapine, a harm no preacher can heal;"
228,IV.,"The Mayfly is torn by the swallow, the sparrow spear'd by the shrike,"
229,IV.,And the whole little wood where I sit is a world of plunder and prey.
230,IV.,
231,IV.,5.
232,IV.,"We are puppets, Man in his pride, and Beauty fair in her flower;"
233,IV.,"Do we move ourselves, or are moved by an unseen hand at a game"
234,IV.,"That pushes us off from the board, and others ever succeed?"
235,IV.,"Ah yet, we cannot be kind to each other here for an hour;"
236,IV.,"We whisper, and hint, and chuckle, and grin at a brother's shame;"
237,IV.,"However we brave it out, we men are a little breed."
238,IV.,
239,IV.,6.
240,IV.,"A monstrous eft was of old the Lord and Master of Earth,"
241,IV.,"For him did his high sun flame, and his river billowing ran,"
242,IV.,And he felt himself in his force to be Nature's crowning race.
243,IV.,"As nine months go to the shaping an infant ripe for his birth,"
244,IV.,So many a million of ages have gone to the making of man:
245,IV.,"He now is first, but is he the last? is he not too base?"
246,IV.,
247,IV.,7.
248,IV.,"The man of science himself is fonder of glory, and vain,"
249,IV.,"An eye well-practised in nature, a spirit bounded and poor;"
250,IV.,The passionate heart of the poet is whirl'd into folly and vice.
251,IV.,"I would not marvel at either, but keep a temperate brain;"
252,IV.,"For not to desire or admire, if a man could learn it, were more"
253,IV.,Than to walk all day like the sultan of old in a garden of spice.
254,IV.,
255,IV.,8.
256,IV.,"For the drift of the Maker is dark, an Isis hid by the veil."
257,IV.,"Who knows the ways of the world, how God will bring them about?"
258,IV.,"Our planet is one, the suns are many, the world is wide."
259,IV.,Shall I weep if a Poland fall? shall I shriek if a Hungary fail?
260,IV.,Or an infant civilisation be ruled with rod or with knout?
261,IV.,"I have not made the world, and He that made it will guide."
262,IV.,
263,IV.,9.
264,IV.,"Be mine a philosopher's life in the quiet woodland ways,"
265,IV.,"Where if I cannot be gay let a passionless peace be my lot,"
266,IV.,Far-off from the clamour of liars belied in the hubbub of lies;
267,IV.,From the long-neck'd geese of the world that are ever hissing dispraise
268,IV.,"Because their natures are little, and, whether he heed it or not,"
269,IV.,Where each man walks with his head in a cloud of poisonous flies.
270,IV.,
271,IV.,10.
272,IV.,"And most of all would I flee from the cruel madness of love,"
273,IV.,The honey of poison-flowers and all the measureless ill.
274,IV.,"Ah Maud, you milkwhite fawn, you are all unmeet for a wife."
275,IV.,Your mother is mute in her grave as her image in marble above;
276,IV.,"Your father is ever in London, you wander about at your will;"
277,IV.,"You have but fed on the roses, and lain in the lilies of life."
278,IV.,
279,IV.,
280,V.,V.
281,V.,
282,V.,1.
283,V.,"A voice by the cedar tree,"
284,V.,In the meadow under the Hall!
285,V.,"She is singing an air that is known to me,"
286,V.,"A passionate ballad gallant and gay,"
287,V.,A martial song like a trumpet's call!
288,V.,"Singing alone in the morning of life,"
289,V.,"In the happy morning of life and of May,"
290,V.,"Singing of men that in battle array,"
291,V.,"Ready in heart and ready in hand,"
292,V.,March with banner and bugle and fife
293,V.,"To the death, for their native land."
294,V.,
295,V.,2.
296,V.,Maud with her exquisite face.
297,V.,"And wild voice pealing up to the sunny sky,"
298,V.,"And feet like sunny gems on an English green,"
299,V.,"Maud in the light of her youth and her grace,"
300,V.,"Singing of Death, and of Honour that cannot die,"
301,V.,"Till I well could weep for a time so sordid and mean,"
302,V.,And myself so languid and base.
303,V.,
304,V.,3.
305,V.,"Silence, beautiful voice!"
306,V.,"Be still, for you only trouble the mind"
307,V.,"With a joy in which I cannot rejoice,"
308,V.,A glory I shall not find.
309,V.,"Still! I will hear you no more,"
310,V.,For your sweetness hardly leaves me a choice
311,V.,But to move to the meadow and fall before
312,V.,"Her feet on the meadow grass, and adore,"
313,V.,"Not her, who is neither courtly nor kind,"
314,V.,"Not her, not her, but a voice."
315,V.,
316,V.,
317,VI.,VI.
318,VI.,
319,VI.,1.
320,VI.,"Morning arises stormy and pale,"
321,VI.,"No sun, but a wannish glare"
322,VI.,"In fold upon fold of hueless cloud,"
323,VI.,And the budded peaks of the wood are bow'd
324,VI.,Caught and cuff'd by the gale:
325,VI.,I had fancied it would be fair.
326,VI.,
327,VI.,2.
328,VI.,Whom but Maud should I meet
329,VI.,"Last night, when the sunset burn'd"
330,VI.,On the blossom'd gable-ends
331,VI.,"At the head of the village street,"
332,VI.,Whom but Maud should I meet?
333,VI.,And she touch'd my hand with a smile so sweet
334,VI.,She made me divine amends
335,VI.,For a courtesy not return'd.
336,VI.,
337,VI.,3.
338,VI.,And thus a delicate spark
339,VI.,Of glowing and growing light
340,VI.,Thro' the livelong hours of the dark
341,VI.,"Kept itself warm in the heart of my dreams,"
342,VI.,Ready to burst in a colour'd flame;
343,VI.,Till at last when the morning came
344,VI.,"In a cloud, it faded, and seems"
345,VI.,But an ashen-gray delight.
346,VI.,
347,VI.,4.
348,VI.,"What if with her sunny hair,"
349,VI.,"And smile as sunny as cold,"
350,VI.,She meant to weave me a snare
351,VI.,"Of some coquettish deceit,"
352,VI.,Cleopatra-like as of old
353,VI.,"To entangle me when we met,"
354,VI.,To have her lion roll in a silken net
355,VI.,And fawn at a victor's feet.
356,VI.,
357,VI.,5.
358,VI.,"Ah, what shall I be at fifty"
359,VI.,"Should Nature keep me alive,"
360,VI.,If I find the world so bitter
361,VI.,When I am but twenty-five?
362,VI.,"Yet, if she were not a cheat,"
363,VI.,"If Maud were all that she seem'd,"
364,VI.,"And her smile were all that I dream'd,"
365,VI.,Then the world were not so bitter
366,VI.,But a smile could make it sweet.
367,VI.,
368,VI.,6.
369,VI.,What if tho' her eye seem'd full
370,VI.,"Of a kind intent to me,"
371,VI.,"What if that dandy-despot, he,"
372,VI.,"That jewell'd mass of millinery,"
373,VI.,That oil'd and curl'd Assyrian Bull
374,VI.,"Smelling of musk and of insolence,"
375,VI.,"Her brother, from whom I keep aloof,"
376,VI.,Who wants the finer politic sense
377,VI.,"To mask, tho' but in his own behoof,"
378,VI.,With a glassy smile his brutal scorn--
379,VI.,What if he had told her yestermorn
380,VI.,How prettily for his own sweet sake
381,VI.,"A face of tenderness might be feign'd,"
382,VI.,"And a moist mirage in desert eyes,"
383,VI.,"That so, when the rotten hustings shake"
384,VI.,"In another month to his brazen lies,"
385,VI.,A wretched vote may be gain'd.
386,VI.,
387,VI.,7.
388,VI.,"For a raven ever croaks, at my side,"
389,VI.,"Keep watch and ward, keep watch and ward,"
390,VI.,Or thou wilt prove their tool.
391,VI.,"Yea too, myself from myself I guard,"
392,VI.,For often a man's own angry pride
393,VI.,Is cap and bells for a fool.
394,VI.,
395,VI.,8.
396,VI.,Perhaps the smile and tender tone
397,VI.,"Came out of her pitying womanhood,"
398,VI.,"For am I not, am I not, here alone"
399,VI.,"So many a summer since she died,"
400,VI.,"My mother, who was so gentle and good?"
401,VI.,"Living alone in an empty house,"
402,VI.,"Here half-hid in the gleaming wood,"
403,VI.,"Where I hear the dead at midday moan,"
404,VI.,"And the shrieking rush of the wainscot mouse,"
405,VI.,"And my own sad name in corners cried,"
406,VI.,When the shiver of dancing leaves is thrown
407,VI.,"About its echoing chambers wide,"
408,VI.,Till a morbid hate and horror have grown
409,VI.,"Of a world in which I have hardly mixt,"
410,VI.,And a morbid eating lichen fixt
411,VI.,On a heart half-turn'd to stone.
412,VI.,
413,VI.,9.
414,VI.,"O heart of stone, are you flesh, and caught"
415,VI.,By that you swore to withstand?
416,VI.,For what was it else within me wrought
417,VI.,"But, I fear, the new strong wine of love,"
418,VI.,That made my tongue so stammer and trip
419,VI.,"When I saw the treasured splendour, her hand,"
420,VI.,"Come sliding out of her sacred glove,"
421,VI.,And the sunlight broke from her lip?
422,VI.,
423,VI.,10.
424,VI.,I have play'd with her when a child;
425,VI.,She remembers it now we meet.
426,VI.,"Ah well, well, well, I may be beguiled"
427,VI.,By some coquettish deceit.
428,VI.,"Yet, if she were not a cheat,"
429,VI.,"If Maud were all that she seem'd,"
430,VI.,"And her smile had all that I dream'd,"
431,VI.,Then the world were not so bitter
432,VI.,But a smile could make it sweet.
433,VI.,
434,VI.,
435,VII.,VII.
436,VII.,
437,VII.,1.
438,VII.,Did I hear it half in a doze
439,VII.,"Long since, I know not where?"
440,VII.,"Did I dream it an hour ago,"
441,VII.,When asleep in this arm-chair?
442,VII.,
443,VII.,2.
444,VII.,"Men were drinking together,"
445,VII.,Drinking and talking of me;
446,VII.,"'Well, if it prove a girl, the boy"
447,VII.,Will have plenty: so let it be.'
448,VII.,
449,VII.,3.
450,VII.,Is it an echo of something
451,VII.,"Read with a boy's delight,"
452,VII.,Viziers nodding together
453,VII.,In some Arabian night?
454,VII.,
455,VII.,4.
456,VII.,"Strange, that I hear two men,"
457,VII.,"Somewhere, talking of me;"
458,VII.,"'Well, if it prove a girl, my boy"
459,VII.,Will have plenty: so let it be.'
460,VII.,
461,VII.,
462,VIII.,VIII.
463,VIII.,
464,VIII.,"She came to the village church,"
465,VIII.,And sat by a pillar alone;
466,VIII.,An angel watching an urn
467,VIII.,"Wept over her, carved in stone;"
468,VIII.,"And once, but once, she lifted her eyes,"
469,VIII.,"And suddenly, sweetly, strangely blush'd"
470,VIII.,To find they were met by my own;
471,VIII.,"And suddenly, sweetly, my heart beat stronger"
472,VIII.,"And thicker, until I heard no longer"
473,VIII.,"The snowy-banded, dilettante,"
474,VIII.,Delicate-handed priest intone;
475,VIII.,"And thought, is it pride, and mused and sigh'd"
476,VIII.,"'No surely, now it cannot be pride.'"
477,VIII.,
478,VIII.,
479,IX.,IX.
480,IX.,
481,IX.,"I was walking a mile,"
482,IX.,"More than a mile from the shore,"
483,IX.,The sun look'd out with a smile
484,IX.,"Betwixt the cloud and the moor,"
485,IX.,And riding at set of day
486,IX.,"Over the dark moor land,"
487,IX.,"Rapidly riding far away,"
488,IX.,She waved to me with her hand.
489,IX.,"There were two at her side,"
490,IX.,"Something flash' d in the sun,"
491,IX.,"Down by the hill I saw them ride,"
492,IX.,In a moment they were gone:
493,IX.,Like a sudden spark
494,IX.,"Struck vainly in the night,"
495,IX.,And back returns the dark
496,IX.,With no more hope of light.
497,IX.,
498,IX.,
499,X.,X.
500,X.,
501,X.,1.
502,X.,"Sick, am I sick of a jealous dread?"
503,X.,Was not one of the two at her side
504,X.,"This new-made lord, whose splendour plucks"
505,X.,The slavish hat from the villager's head?
506,X.,"Whose old grand-father has lately died,"
507,X.,"Gone to a blacker pit, for whom"
508,X.,Grimy nakedness dragging his trucks
509,X.,And laying his trams in a poison'd gloom
510,X.,"Wrought, till he crept from a gutted mine"
511,X.,"Master of half a servile shire,"
512,X.,And left his coal all turn'd into gold
513,X.,"To a grandson, first of his noble line,"
514,X.,"Rich in the grace all women desire,"
515,X.,"Strong in the power that all men adore,"
516,X.,"And simper and set their voices lower,"
517,X.,"And soften as if to a girl, and hold"
518,X.,"Awe-stricken breaths at a work divine,"
519,X.,"Seeing his gewgaw castle shine,"
520,X.,"New as his title, built last year,"
521,X.,"There amid perky larches and pine,"
522,X.,And over the sullen-purple moor
523,X.,(Look at it) pricking a cockney ear.
524,X.,
525,X.,2.
526,X.,"What, has he found my jewel out?"
527,X.,For one of the two that rode at her side
528,X.,"Bound for the Hall, I am sure was he:"
529,X.,"Bound for the Hall, and I think for a bride."
530,X.,Blithe would her brother's acceptance be.
531,X.,"Maud could be gracious too, no doubt,"
532,X.,"To a lord, a captain, a padded shape,"
533,X.,"A bought commission, a waxen face,"
534,X.,A rabbit mouth that is ever agape--
535,X.,Bought? what is it he cannot buy?
536,X.,"And therefore splenetic, personal, base,"
537,X.,"A wounded thing with a rancourous cry,"
538,X.,"At war with myself and a wretched race,"
539,X.,"Sick, sick to the heart of life, am I."
540,X.,
541,X.,3.
542,X.,"Last week came one to the county town,"
543,X.,"To preach our poor little army down,"
544,X.,"And play the game of the despot kings,"
545,X.,Tho' the state has done it and thrice as well:
546,X.,"This broad-brim'd hawker of holy things,"
547,X.,"Whose ear is cramm'd with his cotton, and rings"
548,X.,"Even in dreams to the chink of his pence,"
549,X.,This huckster put down war! can he tell
550,X.,Whether war be a cause or a consequence?
551,X.,Put down the passions that make earth Hell!
552,X.,"Down with ambition, avarice, pride,"
553,X.,"Jealousy, down! cut off from the mind"
554,X.,The bitter springs of anger and fear;
555,X.,"Down too, down at your own fireside,"
556,X.,"With the evil tongue and the evil ear,"
557,X.,For each is at war with mankind.
558,X.,
559,X.,4.
560,X.,I wish I could hear again
561,X.,The chivalrous battle-song
562,X.,That she warbled alone in her joy!
563,X.,I might persuade myself then
564,X.,She would not do herself this great wrong
565,X.,To take a wanton dissolute boy
566,X.,For a man and leader of men.
567,X.,
568,X.,5.
569,X.,"Ah God, for a man with heart, head, hand,"
570,X.,Like some of the simple great ones gone
571,X.,"For ever and ever by,"
572,X.,"One still strong man in a blatant land,"
573,X.,"Whatever they call him, what care I,"
574,X.,"Aristocrat, democrat, autocrat--one"
575,X.,Who can rule and dare not lie.
576,X.,
577,X.,6.
578,X.,"And ah for a man to arise in me,"
579,X.,That the man I am may cease to be!
580,X.,
581,X.,
582,XI.,XI.
583,XI.,
584,XI.,1.
585,XI.,O let the solid ground
586,XI.,Not fail beneath my feet
587,XI.,Before my life has found
588,XI.,What some have found so sweet;
589,XI.,"Then let come what come may,"
590,XI.,"What matter if I go mad,"
591,XI.,I shall have had my day.
592,XI.,
593,XI.,2.
594,XI.,"Let the sweet heavens endure,"
595,XI.,Not close and darken above me
596,XI.,Before I am quite quite sure
597,XI.,That there is one to love me;
598,XI.,Then let come what come may
599,XI.,"To a life that has been so sad,"
600,XI.,I shall have had my day.
601,XI.,
602,XI.,
603,XII.,XII.
604,XII.,
605,XII.,1.
606,XII.,Birds in the high Hall-garden
607,XII.,"When twilight was falling,"
608,XII.,"Maud, Maud, Maud, Maud,"
609,XII.,They were crying and calling.
610,XII.,
611,XII.,2.
612,XII.,Where was Maud? in our wood;
613,XII.,"And I, who else, was with her,"
614,XII.,"Gathering woodland lilies,"
615,XII.,Myriads blow together.
616,XII.,
617,XII.,3.
618,XII.,Birds in our wood sang
619,XII.,"Ringing thro' the vallies,"
620,XII.,"Maud is here, here, here"
621,XII.,In among the lilies.
622,XII.,
623,XII.,4.
624,XII.,"I kiss'd her slender hand,"
625,XII.,She took the kiss sedately;
626,XII.,"Maud is not seventeen,"
627,XII.,But she is tall and stately.
628,XII.,
629,XII.,5.
630,XII.,I to cry out on pride
631,XII.,Who have won her favour!
632,XII.,Maud were sure of Heaven
633,XII.,If lowliness could save her.
634,XII.,
635,XII.,6.
636,XII.,I know the way she went
637,XII.,"Home with her maiden posy,"
638,XII.,For her feet have touch'd the meadows
639,XII.,And left the daisies rosy.
640,XII.,
641,XII.,7.
642,XII.,Birds in the high Hall-garden
643,XII.,"Were crying and calling to her,"
644,XII.,"Where is Maud, Maud, Maud,"
645,XII.,One is come to woo her.
646,XII.,
647,XII.,8.
648,XII.,"Look, a horse at the door,"
649,XII.,"And little King Charles is snarling,"
650,XII.,"Go back, my lord, across the moor,"
651,XII.,You are not her darling.
652,XII.,
653,XII.,
654,XIII.,XIII.
655,XIII.,
656,XIII.,1.
657,XIII.,"Scorn'd, to be scorn'd by one that I scorn,"
658,XIII.,Is that a matter to make me fret?
659,XIII.,That a calamity hard to be borne?
660,XIII.,"Well, he may live to hate me yet."
661,XIII.,Fool that I am to be vext with his pride!
662,XIII.,"I past him, I was crossing his lands;"
663,XIII.,He stood on the path a little aside;
664,XIII.,"His face, as I grant, in spite of spite,"
665,XIII.,"Has a broad-blown comeliness, red and white,"
666,XIII.,"And six feet two, as I think, he stands;"
667,XIII.,"But his essences turn'd the live air sick,"
668,XIII.,And barbarous opulence jewel-thick
669,XIII.,Sunn'd itself on his breast and his hands.
670,XIII.,
671,XIII.,2.
672,XIII.,"Who shall call me ungentle, unfair,"
673,XIII.,I long'd so heartily then and there
674,XIII.,To give him the grasp of fellowship;
675,XIII.,"But while I past he was humming an air,"
676,XIII.,"Stopt, and then with a riding whip"
677,XIII.,"Leisurely tapping a glossy boot,"
678,XIII.,"And curving a contumelious lip,"
679,XIII.,Gorgonised me from head to foot
680,XIII.,With a stony British stare.
681,XIII.,
682,XIII.,3.
683,XIII.,Why sits he here in his father's chair?
684,XIII.,That old man never comes to his place:
685,XIII.,Shall I believe him ashamed to be seen?
686,XIII.,"For only once, in the village street,"
687,XIII.,"Last year, I caught a glimpse of his face,"
688,XIII.,A gray old wolf and a lean.
689,XIII.,"Scarcely, now, would I call him a cheat;"
690,XIII.,"For then, perhaps, as a child of deceit,"
691,XIII.,She might by a true descent be untrue;
692,XIII.,And Maud is as true as Maud is sweet:
693,XIII.,Tho' I fancy her sweetness only due
694,XIII.,To the sweeter blood by the other side;
695,XIII.,"Her mother has been a thing complete,"
696,XIII.,However she came to be so allied.
697,XIII.,"And fair without, faithful within,"
698,XIII.,Maud to him is nothing akin:
699,XIII.,Some peculiar mystic grace
700,XIII.,"Made her only the child of her mother,"
701,XIII.,And heap'd the whole inherited sin
702,XIII.,"On that huge scapegoat of the race,"
703,XIII.,"All, all upon the brother."
704,XIII.,
705,XIII.,4.
706,XIII.,"Peace, angry spirit, and let him be!"
707,XIII.,Has not his sister smiled on me?
708,XIII.,
709,XIII.,
710,XIV.,XIV.
711,XIV.,
712,XIV.,1.
713,XIV.,Maud has a garden of roses
714,XIV.,And lilies fair on a lawn:
715,XIV.,There she walks in her state
716,XIV.,And tends upon bed and bower
717,XIV.,And thither I climb'd at dawn
718,XIV.,And stood by her garden-gate;
719,XIV.,"A lion ramps at the top,"
720,XIV.,He is claspt by a passion-flower.
721,XIV.,
722,XIV.,2.
723,XIV.,Maud's own little oak-room
724,XIV.,"(Which Maud, like a precious stone"
725,XIV.,"Set in the heart of the carven gloom,"
726,XIV.,"Lights with herself, when alone"
727,XIV.,"She sits by her music and books,"
728,XIV.,And her brother lingers late
729,XIV.,With a roystering company) looks
730,XIV.,Upon Maud's own garden gate:
731,XIV.,"And I thought as I stood, if a hand, as white"
732,XIV.,"As ocean-foam in the moon, were laid"
733,XIV.,"On the hasp of the window, and my Delight"
734,XIV.,"Had a sudden desire, like a glorious ghost, to glide,"
735,XIV.,"Like a beam of the seventh Heaven, down to my side,"
736,XIV.,There were but a step to be made.
737,XIV.,
738,XIV.,3.
739,XIV.,"The fancy flatter'd my mind,"
740,XIV.,And again seem'd overbold;
741,XIV.,"Now I thought that she cared for me,"
742,XIV.,Now I thought she was kind
743,XIV.,Only because she was cold.
744,XIV.,
745,XIV.,4.
746,XIV.,I heard no sound where I stood
747,XIV.,But the rivulet on from the lawn
748,XIV.,Running down to my own dark wood;
749,XIV.,Or the voice of the long sea-wave as it swell'd
750,XIV.,Now and then in the dim-gray dawn;
751,XIV.,"But I look'd, and round, all round the house I beheld"
752,XIV.,The death-white curtain drawn;
753,XIV.,"Felt a horror over me creep,"
754,XIV.,"Prickle my skin and catch my breath,"
755,XIV.,"Knew that the death-white curtain meant but sleep,"
756,XIV.,Yet I shudder'd and thought like a fool of the sleep of death.
757,XIV.,
758,XIV.,
759,XV.,XV.
760,XV.,
761,XV.,"So dark a mind within me dwells,"
762,XV.,"And I make myself such evil cheer,"
763,XV.,"That if I be dear to some one else,"
764,XV.,Then some one else may have much to fear;
765,XV.,"But if I be dear to some one else,"
766,XV.,Then I should be to myself more dear.
767,XV.,"Shall I not take care of all that I think,"
768,XV.,"Yea ev'n of wretched meat and drink,"
769,XV.,"If I be dear,"
770,XV.,If I be dear to some one else.
771,XV.,
772,XV.,
773,XVI.,XVI.
774,XVI.,
775,XVI.,1.
776,XVI.,This lump of earth has left his estate
777,XVI.,The lighter by the loss of his weight;
778,XVI.,"And so that he find what he went to seek,"
779,XVI.,"And fulsome Pleasure clog him, and drown"
780,XVI.,"His heart in the gross mud-honey of town,"
781,XVI.,He may stay for a year who has gone for a week:
782,XVI.,"But this is the day when I must speak,"
783,XVI.,"And I see my Oread coming down,"
784,XVI.,O this is the day!
785,XVI.,"O beautiful creature, what am I"
786,XVI.,That I dare to look her way;
787,XVI.,"Think I may hold dominion sweet,"
788,XVI.,"Lord of the pulse that is lord of her breast,"
789,XVI.,"And dream of her beauty with tender dread,"
790,XVI.,From the delicate Arab arch of her feet
791,XVI.,"To the grace that, bright and light as the crest"
792,XVI.,"Of a peacock, sits on her shining head,"
793,XVI.,"And she knows it not: O, if she knew it,"
794,XVI.,To know her beauty might half undo it.
795,XVI.,I know it the one bright thing to save
796,XVI.,"My yet young life in the wilds of Time,"
797,XVI.,"Perhaps from madness, perhaps from crime,"
798,XVI.,Perhaps from a selfish grave.
799,XVI.,
800,XVI.,2.
801,XVI.,"What, if she be fasten'd to this fool lord,"
802,XVI.,Dare I bid her abide by her word?
803,XVI.,Should I love her so well if she
804,XVI.,Had given her word to a thing so low?
805,XVI.,Shall I love her as well if she
806,XVI.,Can break her word were it even for me?
807,XVI.,I trust that it is not so.
808,XVI.,
809,XVI.,3.
810,XVI.,"Catch not my breath, O clamorous heart,"
811,XVI.,"Let not my tongue be a thrall to my eye,"
812,XVI.,"For I must tell her before we part,"
813,XVI.,"I must tell her, or die."
814,XVI.,
815,XVI.,
816,XVII.,XVII.
817,XVII.,
818,XVII.,"Go not, happy day,"
819,XVII.,"From the shining fields,"
820,XVII.,"Go not, happy day."
821,XVII.,Till the maiden yields.
822,XVII.,"Rosy is the West,"
823,XVII.,"Rosy is the South,"
824,XVII.,"Roses are her cheeks,"
825,XVII.,And a rose her mouth.
826,XVII.,When the happy Yes
827,XVII.,"Falters from her lips,"
828,XVII.,Pass and blush the news
829,XVII.,O'er the blowing ships.
830,XVII.,"Over blowing seas,"
831,XVII.,"Over seas at rest,"
832,XVII.,"Pass the happy news,"
833,XVII.,Blush it thro' the West;
834,XVII.,Till the red man dance
835,XVII.,"By his red cedar tree,"
836,XVII.,And the red man's babe
837,XVII.,"Leap, beyond the sea."
838,XVII.,"Blush from West to East,"
839,XVII.,"Blush from East to West,"
840,XVII.,"Till the West is East,"
841,XVII.,Blush it thro' the West.
842,XVII.,"Rosy is the West,"
843,XVII.,"Rosy is the South,"

850,XVIII.,1.
851,XVIII.,"I have led her home, my love, my only friend."
852,XVIII.,"There is none like her, none."
853,XVIII.,And never yet so warmly ran my blood
854,XVIII.,"And sweetly, on and on"
855,XVIII.,"Calming itself to the long-wish'd-for end,"
856,XVIII.,"Full to the banks, close on the promised good."
857,XVIII.,
858,XVIII.,2.
859,XVIII.,"None like her, none."
860,XVIII.,Just now the dry-tongued laurels' pattering talk
861,XVIII.,"Seem'd her light foot along the garden walk,"
862,XVIII.,And shook my heart to think she comes once more;
863,XVIII.,"But even then I heard her close the door,"
864,XVIII.,"The gates of Heaven are closed, and she is gone."
865,XVIII.,
866,XVIII.,3.
867,XVIII.,"There is none like her, none."
868,XVIII.,Nor will be when our summers have deceased.
869,XVIII.,"O, art thou sighing for Lebanon"
870,XVIII.,"In the long breeze that streams to thy delicious East,"
871,XVIII.,"Sighing for Lebanon,"
872,XVIII.,"Dark cedar, tho' thy limbs have here increased,"
873,XVIII.,"Upon a pastoral slope as fair,"
874,XVIII.,"And looking to the South, and fed"
875,XVIII.,"With honey'd rain and delicate air,"
876,XVIII.,And haunted by the starry head
877,XVIII.,"Of her whose gentle will has changed my fate,"
878,XVIII.,And made my life a perfumed altar-flame;
879,XVIII.,And over whom thy darkness must have spread
880,XVIII.,"With such delight as theirs of old, thy great"
881,XVIII.,"Forefathers of the thornless garden, there"
882,XVIII.,Shadowing the snow-limb'd Eve from whom she came.
883,XVIII.,
884,XVIII.,4.
885,XVIII.,"Here will I lie, while these long branches sway,"
886,XVIII.,And you fair stars that crown a happy day
887,XVIII.,"Go in and out as if at merry play,"
888,XVIII.,"Who am no more so all forlorn,"
889,XVIII.,As when it seem'd far better to be born
890,XVIII.,"To labour and the mattock-harden'd hand,"
891,XVIII.,Than nursed at ease and brought to understand
892,XVIII.,"A sad astrology, the boundless plan"
893,XVIII.,"That makes you tyrants in your iron skies,"
894,XVIII.,"Innumerable, pitiless, passionless eyes,"
895,XVIII.,"Cold fires, yet with power to burn and brand"
896,XVIII.,His nothingness into man.
897,XVIII.,
898,XVIII.,5.
899,XVIII.,"But now shine on, and what care I,"
900,XVIII.,Who in this stormy gulf have found a pearl
901,XVIII.,"The countercharm of space and hollow sky,"
902,XVIII.,"And do accept my madness, and would die"
903,XVIII.,To save from some slight shame one simple girl.
904,XVIII.,
905,XVIII.,6.
906,XVIII.,Would die; for sullen-seeming Death may give
907,XVIII.,More life to Love than is or ever was
908,XVIII.,"In our low world, where yet 'tis sweet to live."
909,XVIII.,Let no one ask me how it came to pass;
910,XVIII.,"It seems that I am happy, that to me"
911,XVIII.,"A livelier emerald twinkles in the grass,"
912,XVIII.,A purer sapphire melts into the sea.
913,XVIII.,
914,XVIII.,7.
915,XVIII.,"Not die; but live a life of truest breath,"
916,XVIII.,And teach true life to fight with mortal wrongs.
917,XVIII.,"O, why should Love, like men in drinking-songs,"
918,XVIII.,Spice his fair banquet with the dust of death?
919,XVIII.,"Make answer, Maud my bliss,"
920,XVIII.,"Maud made my Maud by that long lover's kiss,"
921,XVIII.,"Life of my life, wilt thou not answer this?"
922,XVIII.,'The dusky strand of Death inwoven here
923,XVIII.,"With dear Love's tie, makes Love himself more dear.'"
924,XVIII.,
925,XVIII.,8.
926,XVIII.,Is that enchanted moan only the swell
927,XVIII.,Of the long waves that roll in yonder bay?
928,XVIII.,"And hark the clock within, the silver knell"
929,XVIII.,"Of twelve sweet hours that past in bridal white,"
930,XVIII.,"And died to live, long as my pulses play;"
931,XVIII.,But now by this my love has closed her sight
932,XVIII.,"And given false death her hand, and stol'n away"
933,XVIII.,To dreamful wastes where footless fancies dwell
934,XVIII.,Among the fragments of the golden day.
935,XVIII.,May nothing there her maiden grace affright!
936,XVIII.,"Dear heart, I feel with thee the drowsy spell."
937,XVIII.,"My bride to be, my evermore delight,"
938,XVIII.,My own heart's heart and ownest own farewell;
939,XVIII.,It is but for a little space I go:
940,XVIII.,And ye meanwhile far over moor and fell
941,XVIII.,Beat to the noiseless music of the night!
942,XVIII.,Has our whole earth gone nearer to the glow
943,XVIII.,Of your soft splendours that you look so bright?
944,XVIII.,I have climb'd nearer out of lonely Hell.
945,XVIII.,"Beat, happy stars, timing with things below,"
946,XVIII.,"Beat with my heart more blest than heart can tell,"
947,XVIII.,"Blest, but for some dark undercurrent woe"
948,XVIII.,That seems to draw--but it shall not be so:

959,XIX.,My dream? do I dream of bliss?
960,XIX.,I have walk'd awake with Truth.
961,XIX.,O when did a morning shine
962,XIX.,So rich in atonement as this
963,XIX.,"For my dark-dawning youth,"
964,XIX.,Darkened watching a mother decline
965,XIX.,And that dead man at her heart and mine
966,XIX.,For who was left to watch her but I?
967,XIX.,Yet so did I let my freshness die.
968,XIX.,
969,XIX.,3.
970,XIX.,I trust that I did not talk
971,XIX.,To gentle Maud in our walk
972,XIX.,(For often in lonely wanderings
973,XIX.,I have cursed him even to lifeless things)
974,XIX.,"But I trust that I did not talk,"
975,XIX.,Not touch on her father's sin:
976,XIX.,I am sure I did but speak
977,XIX.,Of my mother's faded cheek
978,XIX.,"When it slowly grew so thin,"
979,XIX.,That I felt she was slowly dying
980,XIX.,Vext with lawyers and harass'd with debt:
981,XIX.,"For how often I caught her with eyes all wet,"
982,XIX.,Shaking her head at her son and sighing
983,XIX.,A world of trouble within!
984,XIX.,
985,XIX.,4.
986,XIX.,"And Maud too, Maud was moved"
987,XIX.,To speak of the mother she loved
988,XIX.,"As one scarce less forlorn,"
989,XIX.,Dying abroad and it seems apart
990,XIX.,"From him who had ceased to share her heart,"
991,XIX.,"And ever mourning over the feud,"
992,XIX.,The household Fury sprinkled with blood
993,XIX.,By which our houses are torn:
994,XIX.,"How strange was what she said,"
995,XIX.,When only Maud and the brother
996,XIX.,Hung over her dying bed--
997,XIX.,That Maud's dark father and mine
998,XIX.,"Had bound us one to the other,"
999,XIX.,"Betrothed us over their wine,"
1000,XIX.,On the day when Maud was born;
1001,XIX.,Seal'd her mine from her first sweet breath.
1002,XIX.,"Mine, mine by a right, from birth till death,"
1003,XIX.,"Mine, mine--our fathers have sworn."
1004,XIX.,
1005,XIX.,5.
1006,XIX.,But the true blood spilt had in it a heat
1007,XIX.,"To dissolve the precious seal on a bond,"
1008,XIX.,"That, if left uncancell'd, had been so sweet:"
1009,XIX.,"And none of us thought of a something beyond,"
1010,XIX.,"A desire that awoke in the heart of the child,"
1011,XIX.,"As it were a duty done to the tomb,"
1012,XIX.,"To be friends for her sake, to be reconciled;"
1013,XIX.,"And I was cursing them and my doom,"
1014,XIX.,And letting a dangerous thought run wild
1015,XIX.,While often abroad in the fragrant gloom
1016,XIX.,"Of foreign churches--I see her there,"
1017,XIX.,"Bright English lily, breathing a prayer"
1018,XIX.,"To be friends, to be reconciled!"
1019,XIX.,
1020,XIX.,6.
1021,XIX.,But then what a flint is he!
1022,XIX.,"Abroad, at Florence, at Rome,"
1023,XIX.,I find whenever she touch'd on me
1024,XIX.,"This brother had laugh'd her down,"
1025,XIX.,"And at last, when each came home,"
1026,XIX.,"He had darken'd into a frown,"
1027,XIX.,"Chid her, and forbid her to speak"
1028,XIX.,"To me, her friend of the years before;"
1029,XIX.,And this was what had reddened her cheek
1030,XIX.,When I bow'd to her on the moor.
1031,XIX.,
1032,XIX.,7.
1033,XIX.,"Yet Maud, altho' not blind"
1034,XIX.,"To the faults of his heart and mind,"
1035,XIX.,"I see she cannot but love him,"
1036,XIX.,"And says he is rough but kind,"
1037,XIX.,"And wishes me to approve him,"
1038,XIX.,"And tells me, when she lay"
1039,XIX.,"Sick once, with a fear of worse,"
1040,XIX.,"That he left his wine and horses and play,"
1041,XIX.,"Sat with her, read to her, night and day,"
1042,XIX.,And tended her like a nurse.
1043,XIX.,
1044,XIX.,8.
1045,XIX.,Kind? but the deathbed desire
1046,XIX.,Spurn'd by this heir of the liar--
1047,XIX.,Rough but kind? yet I know
1048,XIX.,"He has plotted against me in this,"
1049,XIX.,That he plots against me still.
1050,XIX.,Kind to Maud? that were not amiss.
1051,XIX.,"Well, rough but kind; why, let it be so:"
1052,XIX.,For shall not Maud have her will?
1053,XIX.,
1054,XIX.,9.
1055,XIX.,"For, Maud, so tender and true."
1056,XIX.,As long as my life endures
1057,XIX.,"I feel I shall owe you a debt,"
1058,XIX.,That I never can hope to pay;
1059,XIX.,And if ever I should forget
1060,XIX.,That I owe this debt to you
1061,XIX.,And for your sweet sake to yours;
1062,XIX.,"O then, what then shall I say?--"
1063,XIX.,If ever I _should_ forget.
1064,XIX.,May God make me more wretched
1065,XIX.,Than ever I have been yet!
1066,XIX.,
1067,XIX.,10.
1068,XIX.,So now I have sworn to bury
1069,XIX.,"All this dead body of hate,"
1070,XIX.,I feel so free and so clear
1071,XIX.,"By the loss of that dead weight,"
1072,XIX.,"That I should grow light-headed, I fear."
1073,XIX.,Fantastically merry;
1074,XIX.,"But that her brother comes, like a blight"

1083,XX.,To beguile her melancholy;
1084,XX.,"The Sultan, as we name him,--"
1085,XX.,She did not wish to blame him--
1086,XX.,But he vext her and perplext her
1087,XX.,With his worldly talk and folly:
1088,XX.,Was it gentle to reprove her
1089,XX.,For stealing out of view
1090,XX.,From a little lazy lover
1091,XX.,Who but claims her as his due?
1092,XX.,Or for chilling his caresses
1093,XX.,"By the coldness of her manners,"
1094,XX.,"Nay, the plainness of her dresses?"
1095,XX.,"Now I know her but in two,"
1096,XX.,Nor can pronounce upon it
1097,XX.,If one should ask me whether
1098,XX.,"The habit, hat, and feather."
1099,XX.,Or the frock and gipsy bonnet
1100,XX.,Be the neater and completer;
1101,XX.,For nothing can be sweeter
1102,XX.,Than maiden Maud in either.
1103,XX.,
1104,XX.,2.
1105,XX.,"But to morrow, if we live,"
1106,XX.,Our ponderous squire will give
1107,XX.,A grand political dinner
1108,XX.,To half the squirelings near;
1109,XX.,"And Maud will wear her jewels,"
1110,XX.,"And the bird of prey will hover,"
1111,XX.,And the titmouse hope to win her
1112,XX.,With his chirrup at her ear.
1113,XX.,
1114,XX.,3.
1115,XX.,A grand political dinner
1116,XX.,"To the men of many acres,"
1117,XX.,"A gathering of the Tory,"
1118,XX.,A dinner and then a dance
1119,XX.,"For the maids and marriage-makers,"
1120,XX.,And every eye but mine will glance
1121,XX.,At Maud in all her glory.
1122,XX.,
1123,XX.,4.
1124,XX.,"For I am not invited,"
1125,XX.,"But, with the Sultan's pardon,"
1126,XX.,"I am all as well delighted,"
1127,XX.,"For I know her own rose-garden,"
1128,XX.,And mean to linger in it
1129,XX.,Till the dancing will be over;
1130,XX.,"And then, oh then, come out to me"
1131,XX.,"For a minute, but for a minute,"
1132,XX.,Come out to your own true lover.
1133,XX.,That your true lover may see

1146,XXI.,"Here at the head of a tinkling fall,"
1147,XXI.,And trying to pass to the sea;
1148,XXI.,"Rivulet, born at the Hall,"
1149,XXI.,My Maud has sent it by thee
1150,XXI.,(If I read her sweet will right)
1151,XXI.,"On a blushing mission to me,"

1161,XXII.,"Come into the garden, Maud,"
1162,XXII.,I am here at the gate alone;
1163,XXII.,"And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,"
1164,XXII.,And the musk of the roses blown.
1165,XXII.,
1166,XXII.,2.
1167,XXII.,"For a breeze of morning moves,"
1168,XXII.,"And the planet of Love is on high,"
1169,XXII.,Beginning to faint in the light that she loves
1170,XXII.,"On a bed of daffodil sky,"
1171,XXII.,To faint in the light of the sun she loves.
1172,XXII.,"To faint in his light, and to die."
1173,XXII.,
1174,XXII.,3.
1175,XXII.,All night have the roses heard
1176,XXII.,"The flute, violin, bassoon;"
1177,XXII.,All night has the casement jessamine stirr'd
1178,XXII.,To the dangers dancing in tune;
1179,XXII.,"Till a silence fell with the waking bird,"
1180,XXII.,And a hush with the setting moon.
1181,XXII.,
1182,XXII.,4.
1183,XXII.,"I said to the lily, 'There is but one"
1184,XXII.,With whom she has heart to be gay.
1185,XXII.,When will the dancers leave her alone?
1186,XXII.,She is weary of dance and play.'
1187,XXII.,"Now half to the setting moon are gone,"
1188,XXII.,And half to the rising day;
1189,XXII.,Low on the sand and loud on the stone
1190,XXII.,The last wheel echoes away.
1191,XXII.,
1192,XXII.,5.
1193,XXII.,"I said to the rose, 'The brief night goes"
1194,XXII.,In babble and revel and wine.
1195,XXII.,"young lord-lover, what sighs are those,"
1196,XXII.,For one that will never be thine?
1197,XXII.,"But mine, but mine,' so I sware to the rose,"
1198,XXII.,"'For ever and ever, mine.'"
1199,XXII.,
1200,XXII.,6.
1201,XXII.,"And the soul of the rose went into my blood,"
1202,XXII.,As the music clash'd in the hall;
1203,XXII.,And long by the garden lake I stood.
1204,XXII.,For I heard your rivulet fall
1205,XXII.,"From the lake to the meadow and on to the wood,"
1206,XXII.,"Our wood, that is dearer than all;"
1207,XXII.,
1208,XXII.,7.
1209,XXII.,From the meadow your walks have left so sweet
1210,XXII.,That whenever a March-wind sighs
1211,XXII.,He sets the jewel-print of your feet
1212,XXII.,"In violets blue as your eyes,"
1213,XXII.,To the woody hollows in which we meet
1214,XXII.,And the valleys of Paradise.
1215,XXII.,
1216,XXII.,8.
1217,XXII.,The slender acacia would not shake
1218,XXII.,One long milk-bloom on the tree;
1219,XXII.,"The white lake-blossom fell into the lake,"
1220,XXII.,As the pimpernel dozed on the lea;
1221,XXII.,"But the rose was awake all night for your sake,"
1222,XXII.,Knowing your promise to me;
1223,XXII.,The lilies and roses were all awake.
1224,XXII.,They sigh'd for the dawn and thee.

1234,XXII.,10.
1235,XXII.,There has fallen a splendid tear
1236,XXII.,From the passion-flower at the gate.
1237,XXII.,"She is coming, my dove, my dear;"
1238,XXII.,"She is coming, my life, my fate;"
1239,XXII.,"The red rose cries, *She is near, she is near;'"
1240,XXII.,"And the white rose weeps, 'She is late;'"
1241,XXII.,"The larkspur listens, 'I hear, I hear;'"
1242,XXII.,"And the lily whispers, 'I wait.'"
1243,XXII.,
1244,XXII.,11.
1245,XXII.,"She is coming, my own, my sweet;"
1246,XXII.,Were it ever so airy a tread.
1247,XXII.,"My heart would hear her and beat,"
1248,XXII.,Were it earth in an earthy bed;
1249,XXII.,"My dust would hear her and beat,"
1250,XXII.,Had I lain for a century dead;
1251,XXII.,"Would start and tremble under her feet,"

1282,I.,Wrought for his house an irredeemable woe;
1283,I.,"For front to front in an hour we stood,"

1285,I.,"From the red-ribb'd hollow behind the wood,"

1463,IV.,"Half the night I waste in sighs,"
1464,IV.,Half in dreams I sorrow after
1465,IV.,The delight of early skies;
1466,IV.,In a wakeful doze I sorrow
1467,IV.,"For the hand, the lips, the eyes,"
1468,IV.,"For the meeting of the morrow,"
1469,IV.,"The delight of happy laughter,"
1470,IV.,The delight of low replies.
1471,IV.,
1472,IV.,6.
1473,IV.,"'Tis a morning pure and sweet,"
1474,IV.,And a dewy splendour falls
1475,IV.,On the little flower that clings
1476,IV.,To the turrets and the walls;
1477,IV.,"'Tis a morning pure and sweet,"
1478,IV.,And the light and shadow fleet;
1479,IV.,"She is walking in the meadow,"
1480,IV.,And the woodland echo rings;
1481,IV.,In a moment we shall meet;
1482,IV.,"She is singing in the meadow,"
1483,IV.,And the rivulet at her feet
1484,IV.,Ripples on in light and shadow
1485,IV.,To the ballad that she sings.
1486,IV.,
1487,IV.,7.
1488,IV.,"Do I hear her sing as of old,"
1489,IV.,"My bird with the shining head,"
1490,IV.,My own dove with the tender eye?
1491,IV.,"But there rings on a sudden a passionate cry,"
1492,IV.,"There is some one dying or dead,"
1493,IV.,And a sullen thunder is roll'd;
1494,IV.,"For a tumult shakes the city,"
1495,IV.,"And I wake, my dream is fled;"
1496,IV.,"In the shuddering dawn, behold,"
1497,IV.,"Without knowledge, without pity,"
1498,IV.,By the curtains of my bed
1499,IV.,That abiding phantom cold.
1500,IV.,
1501,IV.,8.
1502,IV.,"Get thee hence, nor come again,"
1503,IV.,"Mix not memory with doubt,"
1504,IV.,"Pass, thou deathlike type of pain,"
1505,IV.,"Pass and cease to move about,"
1506,IV.,'Tis the blot upon the brain
1507,IV.,That _will_ show itself without.
1508,IV.,
1509,IV.,9.
1510,IV.,"Then I rise, the eavedrops fall,"
1511,IV.,And the yellow vapours choke
1512,IV.,The great city sounding wide;
1513,IV.,"The day comes, a dull red ball"
1514,IV.,Wrapt in drifts of lurid smoke
1515,IV.,On the misty river-tide.
1516,IV.,
1517,IV.,10.
1518,IV.,Thro' the hubbub of the market
1519,IV.,"I steal, a wasted frame,"
1520,IV.,"It crosses here, it crosses there,"
1521,IV.,"Thro' all that crowd confused and loud,"
1522,IV.,The shadow still the same;
1523,IV.,And on my heavy eyelids
1524,IV.,My anguish hangs like shame.
1525,IV.,
1526,IV.,11.
1527,IV.,"Alas for her that met me,"
1528,IV.,"That heard me softly call,"
1529,IV.,Came glimmering thro' the laurels
1530,IV.,"At the quiet evenfall,"
1531,IV.,In the garden by the turrets
1532,IV.,Of the old manorial hall.
1533,IV.,
1534,IV.,12.
1535,IV.,"Would the happy spirit descend,"
1536,IV.,"From the realms of light and song,"
1537,IV.,"In the chamber or the street,"
1538,IV.,"As she looks among the blest,"
1539,IV.,Should I fear to greet my friend
1540,IV.,"Or to say 'forgive the wrong,'"
1541,IV.,"Or to ask her, 'take me, sweet,"
1542,IV.,To the regions of thy rest? '
1543,IV.,
1544,IV.,13.
1545,IV.,"But the broad light glares and beats,"
1546,IV.,And the shadow flits and fleets
1547,IV.,And will not let me be;
1548,IV.,"And I loathe the squares and streets,"
1549,IV.,"And the faces that one meets,"
1550,IV.,Hearts with no love for me:
1551,IV.,Always I long to creep
1552,IV.,"Into some still cavern deep,"
1553,IV.,"There to weep, and weep, and weep"
1554,IV.,My whole soul out to thee.
1555,IV.,
1556,IV.,
1557,V.,V.
1558,V.,
1559,V.,1.
1560,V.,"Dead, long dead,"
1561,V.,Long dead!
1562,V.,"And my heart is a handful of dust,"
1563,V.,"And the wheels go over my head,"
1564,V.,"And my bones are shaken with pain,"
1565,V.,"For into a shallow grave they are thrust,"
1566,V.,"Only a yard beneath the street,"
1567,V.,"And the hoofs of the horses beat, beat,"
1568,V.,"The hoofs of the horses beat,"
1569,V.,"Beat into my scalp and my brain,"
1570,V.,"With never an end to the stream of passing feet,"
1571,V.,"Driving, hurrying, marrying, burying,"
1572,V.,"Clamour and rumble, and ringing and clatter,"
1573,V.,"And here beneath it is all as bad,"
1574,V.,"For I thought the dead had peace, but it is not so;"
1575,V.,"To have no peace in the grave, is that not sad?"
1576,V.,"But up and down and to and fro,"
1577,V.,Ever about me the dead men go;
1578,V.,And then to hear a dead man chatter
1579,V.,Is enough to drive one mad.
1580,V.,
1581,V.,2.
1582,V.,"Wretchedest age, since Time began,"
1583,V.,They cannot even bury a man;
1584,V.,"And tho' we paid our tithes in the days that are gone,"
1585,V.,"Not a bell was rung, not a prayer was read;"
1586,V.,It is that which makes us loud in the world of the dead;
1587,V.,"There is none that does his work, not one;"
1588,V.,"A touch of their office might have sufficed,"
1589,V.,"But the churchmen fain would kill their church,"
1590,V.,As the churches have kill'd their Christ.
1591,V.,
1592,V.,3.
1593,V.,"See, there is one of us sobbing,"
1594,V.,No limit to his distress;
1595,V.,"And another, a lord of all things, praying"
1596,V.,"To his own great self, as I guess;"
1597,V.,"And another, a statesman there, betraying"
1598,V.,"His party-secret, fool, to the press;"
1599,V.,"And yonder a vile physician, blabbing"
1600,V.,The case of his patient-- all for what?
1601,V.,"To tickle the maggot born in an empty head,"
1602,V.,And wheedle a world that loves him not.
1603,V.,For it is but a world of the dead.
1604,V.,
1605,V.,4.
1606,V.,Nothing but idiot gabble!
1607,V.,For the prophecy given of old
1608,V.,"And then not understood,"
1609,V.,Has come to pass as foretold;
1610,V.,"Not let any man think for the public good,"
1611,V.,"But babble, merely for babble."
1612,V.,For I never whisper'd a private affair
1613,V.,"Within the hearing of cat or mouse,"
1614,V.,"No, not to myself in the closet alone,"
1615,V.,But I heard it shouted at once from the top of the house;
1616,V.,Everything came to be known:
1617,V.,Who told _him_ we were there?
1618,V.,
1619,V.,5.
1620,V.,"Not that gray old wolf, for he came not back"
1621,V.,"From the wilderness, full of wolves, where he used to lie;"
1622,V.,He has gather'd the bones for his o'ergrown whelp to crack;
1623,V.,"Crack them now for yourself, and howl, and die."
1624,V.,
1625,V.,6.
1626,V.,"Prophet, curse me the blabbing lip,"
1627,V.,"And curse me the British vermin, the rat;"
1628,V.,"I know not whether he came in the Hanover ship,"
1629,V.,But I know that he lies and listens mute
1630,V.,In an ancient mansion's crannies and holes:
1631,V.,"Arsenic, arsenic, sure, would do it."
1632,V.,"Except that now we poison our babes, poor souls!"
1633,V.,It is all used up for that.
1634,V.,
1635,V.,7.
1636,V.,Tell him now: she is standing here at my head;
1637,V.,"Not beautiful now, not even kind;"
1638,V.,"He may take her now; for she never speaks her mind,"
1639,V.,But is ever the one thing silent here.
1640,V.,"She is not of us, as I divine;"
1641,V.,"She comes from another stiller world of the dead,"
1642,V.,"Stiller, not fairer than mine."
1643,V.,
1644,V.,8.
1645,V.,"But I know where a garden grows,"
1646,V.,"Fairer than aught in the world beside,"
1647,V.,All made up of the lily and rose
1648,V.,"That blow by night, when the season is good,"
1649,V.,To the sound of dancing music and flutes:
1650,V.,"It is only flowers, they had no fruits,"
1651,V.,"And I almost fear they are not roses, but blood;"
1652,V.,"For the keeper was one, so full of pride,"
1653,V.,He linkt a dead man there to a spectral bride;
1654,V.,"For he, if he had not been a Sultan of brutes,"
1655,V.,Would he have that hole in his side?
1656,V.,
1657,V.,9.
1658,V.,But what will the old man say?
1659,V.,He laid a cruel snare in a pit
1660,V.,To catch a friend of mine one stormy day;
1661,V.,Yet now I could even weep to think of it;
1662,V.,For what will the old man say
1663,V.,When he comes to the second corpse in the pit?
1664,V.,
1665,V.,10.
1666,V.,"Friend, to be struck by the public foe,"
1667,V.,"Then to strike him and lay him low,"
1668,V.,"That were a public merit, far,"
1669,V.,"Whatever the Quaker holds, from sin;"
1670,V.,But the red life spilt for a private blow--
1671,V.,"I swear to you, lawful and lawless war"
1672,V.,Are scarcely even akin.
1673,V.,
1674,V.,11.
1675,V.,"O me, why have they not buried me deep enough?"
1676,V.,"Is it kind to have made me a grave so rough,"
1677,V.,"Me, that was never a quiet sleeper?"
1678,V.,Maybe still I am but half-dead;
1679,V.,Then I cannot be wholly dumb;
1680,V.,"I will cry to the steps above my head,"
1681,V.,"And somebody, surely, some kind heart will come"
1682,V.,"To bury me, bury me"
1683,V.,"Deeper, ever so little deeper."
1684,V.,
1685,V.,
1686,VI.,VI.
1687,VI.,
1688,VI.,1.
1689,VI.,My life has crept so long on a broken wing
1690,VI.,"Thro' cells of madness, haunts of horror and fear,"
1691,VI.,That I come to be grateful at last for a little thing:
1692,VI.,"My mood is changed, for it fell at a time of year"
1693,VI.,"When the face of night is fair on the dewy downs,"
1694,VI.,"And the shining daffodil dies, and the Charioteer"
1695,VI.,And starry Gemini hang like glorious crowns
1696,VI.,"Over Orion's grave low down in the west,"
1697,VI.,That like a silent lightning under the stars
1698,VI.,"She seem'd to divide in a dream from a band of the blest,"
1699,VI.,And spoke of a hope for the world in the coming wars--
1700,VI.,"'And in that hope, dear soul, let trouble have rest."
1701,VI.,"Knowing I tarry for thee,' and pointed to Mars"
1702,VI.,As he glow'd like a ruddy shield on the Lion's breast.
1703,VI.,
1704,VI.,2.
1705,VI.,"And it was but a dream, yet it yielded a dear delight"
1706,VI.,"To have look'd, tho' but in a dream, upon eyes so fair,"
1707,VI.,That had been in a weary world my one thing bright;
1708,VI.,"And it was but a dream, yet it lightened my despair"
1709,VI.,"When I thought that a war would arise in defence of the right,"
1710,VI.,"That an iron tyranny now should bend or cease,"
1711,VI.,"The, glory of manhood stand on his ancient height,"
1712,VI.,Nor Britain's one sole God be the millionnaire:
1713,VI.,"No more shall commerce be all in all, and Peace"
1714,VI.,"Pipe on her pastoral hillock a languid note,"
1715,VI.,"And watch her harvest ripen, her herd increase,"
1716,VI.,"Nor the cannon-bullet rust on a slothful shore,"
1717,VI.,And the cobweb woven across the cannon's throat
1718,VI.,Shall shake its threaded tears in the wind no more.
1719,VI.,
1720,VI.,3.
1721,VI.,"And as months ran on and rumour of battle grew,"
1722,VI.,"'It is time, it is time, O passionate heart,' said I"
1723,VI.,"(For I cleaved to a cause that I felt to be pure and true),"
1724,VI.,"'It is time, O passionate heart and morbid eye,"
1725,VI.,That old hysterical mock-disease should die.'
1726,VI.,And I stood on a giant deck and mix'd my breath
1727,VI.,"With a loyal people shouting a battle cry,"
1728,VI.,Till I saw the dreary phantom arise and fly
1729,VI.,"Far into the North, and battle, and seas of death."
1730,VI.,
1731,VI.,4.
1732,VI.,"Let it go or stay, so I wake to the higher aims"
1733,VI.,"Of a land that has lost for a little her lust of gold,"
1734,VI.,"And love of a peace that was full of wrongs and shames,"
1735,VI.,"Horrible, hateful, monstrous, not to be told;"
1736,VI.,And hail once more to the banner of battle unroll'd!
1737,VI.,"Tho' many a light shall darken, and many shall weep"
1738,VI.,"For those that are crush'd in the clash of jarring claims,"
1739,VI.,Yet God's just wrath shall be wreak'd on a giant liar;
1740,VI.,"And many a darkness into the light shall leap,"
1741,VI.,"And shine in the sudden making of splendid names,"
1742,VI.,"And noble thought be freer under the sun,"
1743,VI.,And the heart of a people beat with one desire;
1744,VI.,"For the peace, that I deem'd no peace, is over and done,"
1745,VI.,"And now by the side of the Black and the Baltic deep,"
1746,VI.,"And deathful-grinning mouths of the fortress, flames"
1747,VI.,The blood-red blossom of war with a heart of fire.
1748,VI.,
1749,VI.,5.
1750,VI.,"Let it flame or fade, and the war roll down like a wind,"
1751,VI.,"We have proved we have hearts in a cause, we are noble still,"
1752,VI.,"And myself have awaked, as it seems, to the better mind;"
1753,VI.,"It is better to fight for the good, than to rail at the ill;"
1754,VI.,"I have felt with my native land, I am one with my kind,"
1755,VI.,"I embrace the purpose of God, and the doom assign'd."

1764,AN IDYL.,One whom the strong sons of the world despise;

1766,AN IDYL.,And mellow metres more than cent for cent;
1767,AN IDYL.,"Nor could he understand how money breeds,"
1768,AN IDYL.,Thought it a dead thing; yet himself could make
1769,AN IDYL.,The thing that is not as the thing that is.
1770,AN IDYL.,"O had he lived! In our schoolbooks we say,"
1771,AN IDYL.,"Of those that held their heads above the crowd,"
1772,AN IDYL.,They flourish'd then or then; but life in him
1773,AN IDYL.,"Could scarce be said to flourish, only touched"
1774,AN IDYL.,"On such a time as goes before the leaf,"
1775,AN IDYL.,"When all the wood stands in a mist of green,"
1776,AN IDYL.,"And nothing perfect: yet the brook he loved,"
1777,AN IDYL.,"For which, in branding summers of Bengal,"
1778,AN IDYL.,"Or ev'n the sweet half-English Neilgherry air,"
1779,AN IDYL.,"I panted, seems, as I re-listen to it,"

1784,AN IDYL.,
1785,AN IDYL.,"I come from haunts of coot and hern,"

1809,AN IDYL.,
1810,AN IDYL.,With many a curve my banks I fret

1812,AN IDYL.,And many a fairy foreland set
1813,AN IDYL.,With willow-weed and mallow.

1896,AN IDYL.,"'O Katie, what I suffered for your sake!"
1897,AN IDYL.,"For in I went, and call'd old Philip out"
1898,AN IDYL.,To show the farm: full willingly he rose:
1899,AN IDYL.,He led me thro' the short sweet-smelling lanes
1900,AN IDYL.,"Of his wheat-suburb, babbling as he went."
1901,AN IDYL.,"He praised his land, his horses, his machines;"
1902,AN IDYL.,"He praised his ploughs, his cows, his hogs, his dogs;"
1903,AN IDYL.,"He praised his hens, his geese, his guinea-hens;"
1904,AN IDYL.,"His pigeons, who in session on their roofs"
1905,AN IDYL.,"Approved him, bowing at their own deserts:"
1906,AN IDYL.,Then from the plaintive mother's teat he took
1907,AN IDYL.,"Her blind and shuddering puppies, naming each."
1908,AN IDYL.,"And naming those, his friends, for whom they were:"
1909,AN IDYL.,Then crost the common into Darnley chase
1910,AN IDYL.,To show Sir Arthur's deer. In copse and fern
1911,AN IDYL.,Twinkled the innumerable ear and tail.
1912,AN IDYL.,"Then, seated on a serpent-rooted beech,"
1913,AN IDYL.,"He pointed out a pasturing colt, and said:"
1914,AN IDYL.,'That was the four-year-old I sold the Squire.'
1915,AN IDYL.,And there he told a long long-winded tale
1916,AN IDYL.,"Of how the Squire had seen the colt at grass,"
1917,AN IDYL.,"And how it was the thing his daughter wish'd,"
1918,AN IDYL.,And how he sent the bailiff to the farm
1919,AN IDYL.,"To learn the price, and what the price he ask'd,"
1920,AN IDYL.,"And how the bailiff swore that he was mad,"
1921,AN IDYL.,But he stood firm; and so the matter hung;
1922,AN IDYL.,He gave them line: and five days after that
1923,AN IDYL.,"He met the bailiff at the Golden Fleece,"
1924,AN IDYL.,"Who then and there had offer'd something more,"
1925,AN IDYL.,But he stood firm; and so the matter hung;
1926,AN IDYL.,He knew the man; the colt would fetch its price;
1927,AN IDYL.,He gave them line: and how by chance at last
1928,AN IDYL.,"(It might be May or April, he forgot,"
1929,AN IDYL.,The last of April or the first of May)
1930,AN IDYL.,"He found the bailiff riding by the farm,"
1931,AN IDYL.,"And, talking from the point, he drew him in,"
1932,AN IDYL.,"And there he mellow'd all his heart with ale,"
1933,AN IDYL.,"Until they closed a bargain, hand in hand."
1934,AN IDYL.,
1935,AN IDYL.,"'Then, while I breathed in sight of haven, he,"
1936,AN IDYL.,"Poor fellow, could he help it? Recommenced,"
1937,AN IDYL.,"And ran thro' all the coltish chronicle,"
1938,AN IDYL.,"Wild Will, Black Bess, Tantivy, Tallyho,"
1939,AN IDYL.,"Reform, White Rose, Bellerophon, the Jilt,"
1940,AN IDYL.,"Arbaces, and Phenomenon, and the rest,"
1941,AN IDYL.,"Till, not to die a listener, I arose,"
1942,AN IDYL.,"And with me Philip, talking still; and so"
1943,AN IDYL.,"We turn'd our foreheads from the falling sun,"
1944,AN IDYL.,And following our own shadows thrice as long
1945,AN IDYL.,"As when they follow'd us from Philip's door,"
1946,AN IDYL.,"Arrived, and found the sun of sweet content"
1947,AN IDYL.,"Re-risen in Katie's eyes, and all things well."
1948,AN IDYL.,
1949,AN IDYL.,"I steal by lawns and grassy plots,"
1950,AN IDYL.,I slide by hazel covers;
1951,AN IDYL.,I move the sweet forget-me-nots
1952,AN IDYL.,That grow for happy lovers.
1953,AN IDYL.,
1954,AN IDYL.,"I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance."
1955,AN IDYL.,Among my skimming swallows;
1956,AN IDYL.,I make the netted sunbeam dance
1957,AN IDYL.,Against my sandy shallows.
1958,AN IDYL.,
1959,AN IDYL.,I murmur under moon and stars
1960,AN IDYL.,In brambly wildernesses;
1961,AN IDYL.,I linger by my shingly bars;
1962,AN IDYL.,I loiter round my cresses;
1963,AN IDYL.,
1964,AN IDYL.,And out again I curve and flow
1965,AN IDYL.,"To join the brimming river,"
1966,AN IDYL.,"For men may come and men may go,"
1967,AN IDYL.,But I go on for ever.
1968,AN IDYL.,
1969,AN IDYL.,"Yes, men may come and go; and these are gone,"
1970,AN IDYL.,"All gone. My dearest brother, Edmund, sleeps,"
1971,AN IDYL.,"Not by the well-known stream and rustic spire,"
1972,AN IDYL.,"But unfamiliar Arno, and the dome"
1973,AN IDYL.,"Of Brunelleschi; sleeps in peace: and he,"
1974,AN IDYL.,"Poor Philip, of all his lavish waste of words"
1975,AN IDYL.,Remains the lean P. W. on his tomb:
1976,AN IDYL.,I scraped the lichen from it: Katie walks
1977,AN IDYL.,By the long wash of Australasian seas
1978,AN IDYL.,"Far off, and holds her head to other stars,"
1979,AN IDYL.,And breathes in converse seasons. All are gone.'
1980,AN IDYL.,
1981,AN IDYL.,"So Lawrence Aylmer, seated on a style"
1982,AN IDYL.,"In the long hedge, and rolling in his mind"
1983,AN IDYL.,"Old waifs of rhyme, and bowing o'er the brook"
1984,AN IDYL.,"A tonsured head in middle age forlorn,"
1985,AN IDYL.,"Mused, and was mute. On a sudden a low breath"
1986,AN IDYL.,Of tender air made tremble in the hedge
1987,AN IDYL.,The fragile bindweed-bells and briony rings;
1988,AN IDYL.,"And he look'd up. There stood a maiden near,"
1989,AN IDYL.,Waiting to pass. In much amaze he stared
1990,AN IDYL.,"On eyes a bashful azure, and on hair"
1991,AN IDYL.,"In gloss and hue the chestnut, when the shell"
1992,AN IDYL.,Divides threefold to show the fruit within:
1993,AN IDYL.,"Then, wondering, ask'd her 'Are you from the farm?'"
1994,AN IDYL.,'Yes' answer'd she. 'Pray stay a little: pardon me;
1995,AN IDYL.,What do they call you?' 'Katie.' 'That were strange.
1996,AN IDYL.,What surname? 'Willows.' 'No!' 'That is my name.'
1997,AN IDYL.,"'Indeed!' and here he look'd so self-perplext,"
1998,AN IDYL.,"That Katie laugh'd, and laughing blush'd, till he"
1999,AN IDYL.,"Laugh'd also, but as one before he wakes,"
2000,AN IDYL.,Who feels a glimmering strangeness in his dream.
2001,AN IDYL.,"Then looking at her; 'Too happy, fresh and fair,"
2002,AN IDYL.,"Too fresh and fair in our sad world's best bloom,"
2003,AN IDYL.,To be the ghost of one who bore your name
2004,AN IDYL.,"About these meadows, twenty years ago.'"
2005,AN IDYL.,"'Have you not heard?' said Katie, 'we came back."
2006,AN IDYL.,We bought the farm we tenanted before.
2007,AN IDYL.,Am I so like her? so they said on board.
2008,AN IDYL.,"Sir, if you knew her in her English days,"
2009,AN IDYL.,"My mother, as it seems you did, the days"
2010,AN IDYL.,"That most she loves to talk of, come with me."
2011,AN IDYL.,My brother James is in the harvest-field:
2012,AN IDYL.,"But she--you will be welcome--O, come in!'"

2038,THE LETTERS.,3.
2039,THE LETTERS.,"She took the little ivory chest,"
