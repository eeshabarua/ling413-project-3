105,THE EXCURSION,
106,THE EXCURSION,
107,THE EXCURSION,"[Something must now be said of this poem, but chiefly, as has been done"
108,THE EXCURSION,"through the whole of these notes, with reference to my personal friends,"
109,THE EXCURSION,and especially to her who has perseveringly taken them down from my
110,THE EXCURSION,"dictation. Towards the close of the first book, stand the lines that were"
111,THE EXCURSION,"first written,--beginning ""Nine tedious years,"" and ending ""Last human"
112,THE EXCURSION,"tenant of these ruined walls."" These were composed in 1795, at Racedown;"
113,THE EXCURSION,and for several passages describing the employment and demeanour of
114,THE EXCURSION,"Margaret during her affliction, I was indebted to observations made"
115,THE EXCURSION,"in Dorsetshire, and afterwards at Alfoxden, in Somersetshire, where"
116,THE EXCURSION,I resided in 1797 and 1798. The lines towards the conclusion of the
117,THE EXCURSION,"fourth book, ""Despondency corrected,""--beginning ""For the man who in"
118,THE EXCURSION,"this spirit,"" to the words ""intellectual soul,""--were in order of time"
119,THE EXCURSION,"composed the next, either at Racedown or Alfoxden, I do not remember"
120,THE EXCURSION,"which. The rest of the poem was written in the vale of Grasmere, chiefly"
121,THE EXCURSION,during our residence at Allan Bank. The long poem on my own education
122,THE EXCURSION,"was, together with many minor poems, composed while we lived at the"
123,THE EXCURSION,cottage at Town-end. Perhaps my purpose of giving an additional interest
124,THE EXCURSION,"to these my poems, in the eyes of my nearest and dearest friends, may be"
125,THE EXCURSION,"promoted by saying a few words upon the character of the Wanderer, the"
126,THE EXCURSION,"Solitary, and the Pastor, and some other of the persons introduced. And"
127,THE EXCURSION,"first of the principal one, the Wanderer."
128,THE EXCURSION,
129,THE EXCURSION,My lamented friend Southey (for this is written a month after his
130,THE EXCURSION,"decease[A]) used to say that had he been born a Papist, the course of"
131,THE EXCURSION,"life which would in all probability have been his, was the one for which"
132,THE EXCURSION,"he was most fitted and most to his mind, that of a Benedictine monk, in"
133,THE EXCURSION,"a convent, furnished, as many once were, and some still are, with an"
134,THE EXCURSION,"inexhaustible library. _Books_, as appears from many passages in his"
135,THE EXCURSION,"writings, and was evident to those who had opportunities of observing his"
136,THE EXCURSION,"daily life, were in fact _his passion_; and _wandering_, I can with truth"
137,THE EXCURSION,"affirm, was _mine_; but this propensity in me was happily counteracted by"
138,THE EXCURSION,inability from want of fortune to fulfil my wishes.
139,THE EXCURSION,
140,THE EXCURSION,But had I been born in a class which would have deprived me of what is
141,THE EXCURSION,"called a liberal education, it is not unlikely that, being strong in"
142,THE EXCURSION,"body, I should have taken to a way of life such as that in which my"
143,THE EXCURSION,"Pedlar passed the greater part of his days. At all events, I am here"
144,THE EXCURSION,called upon freely to acknowledge that the character I have represented
145,THE EXCURSION,in his person is chiefly an idea of what I fancied my own character might
146,THE EXCURSION,have become in his circumstances. Nevertheless much of what he says and
147,THE EXCURSION,"does had an external existence, that fell under my own youthful and"
148,THE EXCURSION,subsequent observation.
149,THE EXCURSION,
150,THE EXCURSION,"An individual, named Patrick, by birth and education a Scotchman,"
151,THE EXCURSION,"followed this humble occupation for many years, and afterwards settled"
152,THE EXCURSION,"in the town of Kendal.[B] He married a kinswoman of my wife's, and her"
153,THE EXCURSION,sister Sarah was brought up from her ninth year under this good man's
154,THE EXCURSION,"roof.[C] My own imaginations I was happy to find clothed in reality,"
155,THE EXCURSION,"and fresh ones suggested, by what she reported of this man's tenderness"
156,THE EXCURSION,"of heart, his strong and pure imagination, and his solid attainments in"
157,THE EXCURSION,"literature, chiefly religious, whether in prose or verse. At Hawkshead"
158,THE EXCURSION,"also, while I was a schoolboy, there occasionally resided a Packman"
159,THE EXCURSION,"(the name then generally given to persons of this calling), with whom"
160,THE EXCURSION,"I had frequent conversations upon what had befallen him, and what he"
161,THE EXCURSION,"had observed, during his wandering life; and, as was natural, we took"
162,THE EXCURSION,"much to each other; and, upon the subject of _Pedlarism_ in general, as"
163,THE EXCURSION,"_then_ followed, and its favourableness to an intimate knowledge of human"
164,THE EXCURSION,"concerns, not merely among the humbler classes of society, I need say"
165,THE EXCURSION,"nothing here in addition to what is to be found in _The Excursion_, and a"
166,THE EXCURSION,note attached to it.
167,THE EXCURSION,
168,THE EXCURSION,Now for the Solitary. Of him I have much less to say. Not long after we
169,THE EXCURSION,"took up our abode at Grasmere, came to reside there, from what motive"
170,THE EXCURSION,"I either never knew or have forgotten, a Scotchman, a little past the"
171,THE EXCURSION,"middle of life, who had for many years been chaplain to a Highland"
172,THE EXCURSION,"regiment. He was in no respect, as far as I know, an interesting"
173,THE EXCURSION,"character, though in his appearance there was a good deal that attracted"
174,THE EXCURSION,"attention, as if he had been shattered in fortune, and not happy in mind."
175,THE EXCURSION,"Of his quondam position I availed myself to connect with the Wanderer,"
176,THE EXCURSION,"also a Scotchman, a character suitable to my purpose, the elements of"
177,THE EXCURSION,"which I drew from several persons with whom I had been connected, and"
178,THE EXCURSION,who fell under my observation during frequent residences in London at
179,THE EXCURSION,"the beginning of the French Revolution. The chief of these was, one may"
180,THE EXCURSION,"now say, a Mr. Fawcett, a preacher at a Dissenting meeting-house at the"
181,THE EXCURSION,Old Jewry. It happened to me several times to be one of his congregation
182,THE EXCURSION,"through my connection with Mr. Nicholson of Cateaton Street, Strand,"
183,THE EXCURSION,"who, at a time when I had not many acquaintances in London, used often"
184,THE EXCURSION,to invite me to dine with him on Sundays; and I took that opportunity
185,THE EXCURSION,"(Mr. N. being a Dissenter) of going to hear Fawcett, who was an able and"
186,THE EXCURSION,"eloquent man. He published a poem on War, which had a good deal of merit,"
187,THE EXCURSION,and made me think more about him than I should otherwise have done.
188,THE EXCURSION,"But his Christianity was probably never very deeply rooted; and, like"
189,THE EXCURSION,"many others in those times of like shewy talents, he had not strength"
190,THE EXCURSION,"of character to withstand the effects of the French Revolution, and of"
191,THE EXCURSION,"the wild and lax opinions which had done so much towards producing it,"
192,THE EXCURSION,"and far more in carrying it forward in its extremes. Poor Fawcett, I"
193,THE EXCURSION,"have been told, became pretty much such a person as I have described,"
194,THE EXCURSION,"and early disappeared from the stage, having fallen into habits of"
195,THE EXCURSION,"intemperance, which I have heard (though I will not answer for the fact)"
196,THE EXCURSION,hastened his death. Of him I need say no more. There were many like him
197,THE EXCURSION,"at that time, which the world will never be without, but which were more"
198,THE EXCURSION,"numerous then, for reasons too obvious to be dwelt upon."
199,THE EXCURSION,
200,THE EXCURSION,"To what is said of the Pastor in the poem, I have little to add but what"
201,THE EXCURSION,may be deemed superfluous. It has ever appeared to me highly favourable
202,THE EXCURSION,to the beneficial influence of the Church of England upon all gradations
203,THE EXCURSION,"and classes of society, that the patronage of its benefices is in"
204,THE EXCURSION,numerous instances attached to the estates of noble families of ancient
205,THE EXCURSION,gentry; and accordingly I am gratified by the opportunity afforded me in
206,THE EXCURSION,"_The Excursion_, to pourtray the character of a country clergyman of more"
207,THE EXCURSION,"than ordinary talents, born and bred in the upper ranks of society so"
208,THE EXCURSION,"as to partake of their refinements, and at the same time brought by his"
209,THE EXCURSION,pastoral office and his love of rural life into intimate connection with
210,THE EXCURSION,the peasantry of his native district.
211,THE EXCURSION,
212,THE EXCURSION,To illustrate the relation which in my mind this Pastor bore to the
213,THE EXCURSION,"Wanderer, and the resemblances between them, or rather the points of"
214,THE EXCURSION,"community in their nature, I likened one to an oak, and the other to a"
215,THE EXCURSION,"sycamore; and having here referred to this comparison, I need only add, I"
216,THE EXCURSION,"had no one individual in my mind, wishing rather to embody this idea than"
217,THE EXCURSION,"to break in upon the simplicity of it by traits of individual character,"
218,THE EXCURSION,or of any peculiarity of opinion.
219,THE EXCURSION,
220,THE EXCURSION,And now for a few words upon the scene where these interviews and
221,THE EXCURSION,conversations are supposed to occur.
222,THE EXCURSION,
223,THE EXCURSION,"The scene of the first book of the poem is, I must own, laid in a"
224,THE EXCURSION,tract of country not sufficiently near to that which soon comes into
225,THE EXCURSION,"view in the second book, to agree with the fact. All that relates to"
226,THE EXCURSION,"Margaret, and the ruined cottage, etc., was taken from observations"
227,THE EXCURSION,"made in the south-west of England, and certainly it would require more"
228,THE EXCURSION,"than seven-league boots to stretch in one morning, from a common in"
229,THE EXCURSION,"Somersetshire, or Dorsetshire, to the heights of Furness Fells, and the"
230,THE EXCURSION,"deep valleys they embosom. For thus dealing with space, I need make, I"
231,THE EXCURSION,"trust, no apology; but my friends may be amused by the truth."
232,THE EXCURSION,
233,THE EXCURSION,"In the poem, I suppose that the Pedlar and I ascended from a plain"
234,THE EXCURSION,"country up the vale of Langdale, and struck off a good way above the"
235,THE EXCURSION,"chapel to the western side of the vale. We ascended the hill, and thence"
236,THE EXCURSION,"looked down upon the circular recess in which lies Blea Tarn, chosen by"
237,THE EXCURSION,"the Solitary for his retreat. After we quit his cottage, passing over"
238,THE EXCURSION,"a low ridge, we descend into another vale, that of Little Langdale,"
239,THE EXCURSION,"towards the head of which stands embowered, or partly shaded by yews and"
240,THE EXCURSION,"other trees, something between a cottage and a mansion, or gentleman's"
241,THE EXCURSION,"house, such as they once were in this country. This I convert into the"
242,THE EXCURSION,"parsonage, and at the same time, and as by the waving of a magic wand, I"
243,THE EXCURSION,"turn the comparatively confined vale of Langdale, its tarn, and the rude"
244,THE EXCURSION,"chapel which once adorned the valley, into the stately and comparatively"
245,THE EXCURSION,spacious vale of Grasmere and its ancient parish church; and upon the
246,THE EXCURSION,"side of Loughrigg Fell, at the foot of the lake, and looking down upon it"
247,THE EXCURSION,"and the whole Vale and its encompassing mountains, the Pastor is supposed"
248,THE EXCURSION,"by me to stand, when at sunset he addresses his companions in words"
249,THE EXCURSION,"which I hope my readers will remember,[D] or I should not have taken"
250,THE EXCURSION,the trouble of giving so much in detail the materials on which my mind
251,THE EXCURSION,actually worked.
252,THE EXCURSION,
253,THE EXCURSION,"Now for a few particulars of _fact_, respecting the persons whose stories"
254,THE EXCURSION,are told or characters described by the different speakers. To Margaret I
255,THE EXCURSION,"have already alluded. I will add here that the lines beginning,"
256,THE EXCURSION,
257,THE EXCURSION,"She was a woman of a steady mind,"
258,THE EXCURSION,
259,THE EXCURSION,and ending
260,THE EXCURSION,
261,THE EXCURSION,"Live on earth a life of happiness,"
262,THE EXCURSION,
263,THE EXCURSION,"faithfully delineate, as far as they go, the character possessed in"
264,THE EXCURSION,common by many women whom it has been my happiness to know in humble
265,THE EXCURSION,life; and that several of the most touching things which she is
266,THE EXCURSION,represented as saying and doing are taken from actual observation of the
267,THE EXCURSION,"distresses and trials under which different persons were suffering, some"
268,THE EXCURSION,"of them strangers to me, and others daily under my notice."
269,THE EXCURSION,
270,THE EXCURSION,I was born too late to have a distinct remembrance of the origin of the
271,THE EXCURSION,"American war; but the state in which I represent Robert's mind to be,"
272,THE EXCURSION,I had frequent opportunities of observing at the commencement of our
273,THE EXCURSION,rupture with France in 1793; opportunities of which I availed myself
274,THE EXCURSION,"in the story of the Female Vagrant, as told in the poem on _Guilt and"
275,THE EXCURSION,"Sorrow_. The account given by the Solitary, towards the close of the"
276,THE EXCURSION,"second book, in all that belongs to the character of the old man, was"
277,THE EXCURSION,"taken from a Grasmere pauper, who was boarded in the last house quitting"
278,THE EXCURSION,"the vale on the road to Ambleside; the character of his hostess, and all"
279,THE EXCURSION,"that befell the poor man upon the mountain, belongs to Paterdale. The"
280,THE EXCURSION,"woman I knew well; her name was Ruth Jackson, and she was exactly such a"
281,THE EXCURSION,"person as I describe. The ruins of the old chapel, among which the old"
282,THE EXCURSION,"man was found lying, may yet be traced, and stood upon the ridge that"
283,THE EXCURSION,"divides Paterdale from Boardale and Martindale, having been placed there"
284,THE EXCURSION,for the convenience of both districts. The glorious appearance disclosed
285,THE EXCURSION,"above and among the mountains, was described partly from what my friend"
286,THE EXCURSION,"Mr. Luff, who then lived in Paterdale, witnessed upon that melancholy"
287,THE EXCURSION,"occasion, and partly from what Mary and I had seen, in company with Sir"
288,THE EXCURSION,"George and Lady Beaumont, above Hartshope Hall, on our way from Paterdale"
289,THE EXCURSION,to Ambleside.
290,THE EXCURSION,
291,THE EXCURSION,"And now for a few words upon the Church, its Monuments, and of the"
292,THE EXCURSION,Deceased who are spoken of as lying in the surrounding churchyard. But
293,THE EXCURSION,first for the one picture given by the Pastor and the Wanderer of the
294,THE EXCURSION,Living. In this nothing is introduced but what was taken from nature and
295,THE EXCURSION,"real life. The cottage was called Hackett, and stands, as described, on"
296,THE EXCURSION,the southern extremity of the ridge which separates the two Langdales.
297,THE EXCURSION,The pair who inhabited it were called Jonathan and Betty Yewdale. Once
298,THE EXCURSION,"when our children were ill, of whooping-cough, I think, we took them"
299,THE EXCURSION,"for change of air to this cottage, and were in the habit of going there"
300,THE EXCURSION,"to drink tea upon fine summer afternoons, so that we became intimately"
301,THE EXCURSION,"acquainted with the characters, habits, and lives of these good, and let"
302,THE EXCURSION,"me say, in the main, wise people. The matron had, in her early youth,"
303,THE EXCURSION,"been a servant in a house at Hawkshead, where several boys boarded,"
304,THE EXCURSION,while I was a schoolboy there. I did not remember her as having served
305,THE EXCURSION,in that capacity; but we had many little anecdotes to tell to each other
306,THE EXCURSION,"of remarkable boys, incidents, and adventures, which had made a noise in"
307,THE EXCURSION,their day in that small town. These two persons were induced afterwards
308,THE EXCURSION,"to settle at Rydal, where they both died."
309,THE EXCURSION,
310,THE EXCURSION,"The church, as already noticed, is that of Grasmere. The interior of"
311,THE EXCURSION,"it has been improved lately and made warmer by underdrawing the roof,"
312,THE EXCURSION,and raising the floor; but the rude and antique majesty of its former
313,THE EXCURSION,appearance has been impaired by painting the rafters; and the oak
314,THE EXCURSION,"benches, with a simple rail at the back dividing them from each other,"
315,THE EXCURSION,have given way to seats that have more the appearance of pews. It is
316,THE EXCURSION,"remarkable that, excepting only the pew belonging to Rydal Hall, that to"
317,THE EXCURSION,"Rydal Mount, the one to the Parsonage, and I believe another, the men and"
318,THE EXCURSION,"women still continue, as used to be the custom in Wales, to sit separate"
319,THE EXCURSION,from each other. Is this practice as old as the Reformation? and when and
320,THE EXCURSION,"how did it originate? In the Jewish synagogues, and in Lady Huntingdon's"
321,THE EXCURSION,"chapels, the sexes are divided in the same way. In the adjoining"
322,THE EXCURSION,churchyard greater changes have taken place. It is now not a little
323,THE EXCURSION,"crowded with tombstones; and near the school-house, which stands in the"
324,THE EXCURSION,"churchyard, is an ugly structure, built to receive the hearse, which is"
325,THE EXCURSION,recently come into use. It would not be worth while to allude to this
326,THE EXCURSION,"building, or the hearse-vehicle it contains, but that the latter has"
327,THE EXCURSION,been the means of introducing a change much to be lamented in the mode
328,THE EXCURSION,"of conducting funerals among the mountains. Now, the coffin is lodged"
329,THE EXCURSION,"in the hearse at the door of the house of the deceased, and the corpse"
330,THE EXCURSION,is so conveyed to the churchyard gate. All the solemnity which formerly
331,THE EXCURSION,"attended its progress, as described in this poem, is put an end to. So"
332,THE EXCURSION,"much do I regret this, that I beg to be excused for giving utterance here"
333,THE EXCURSION,"to a wish that, should it befall me to die at Rydal Mount, my own body"
334,THE EXCURSION,"may be carried to Grasmere Church after the manner in which, till lately,"
335,THE EXCURSION,"that of every one was borne to the place of sepulture here, namely, on"
336,THE EXCURSION,the shoulders of neighbours; no house being passed without some words of
337,THE EXCURSION,a funeral psalm being sung at the time by the attendants bearing it. When
338,THE EXCURSION,"I put into the mouth of the Wanderer, ""Many precious rites and customs of"
339,THE EXCURSION,"our rural ancestry are gone, or stealing from us; this, I hope, will last"
340,THE EXCURSION,"for ever,"" and what follows, little did I foresee that the observance and"
341,THE EXCURSION,mode of proceeding which had often affected me so much would so soon be
342,THE EXCURSION,superseded.
343,THE EXCURSION,
344,THE EXCURSION,"Having said much of the injury done to this churchyard, let me add, that"
345,THE EXCURSION,"one is at liberty to look forward to a time when, by the growth of the"
346,THE EXCURSION,"yew-trees thriving there, a solemnity will be spread over the place that"
347,THE EXCURSION,will in some degree make amends for the old simple character which has
348,THE EXCURSION,"already been so much encroached upon, and will be still more every year."
349,THE EXCURSION,"I will here set down, by way of memorial, that my friend Sir George"
350,THE EXCURSION,"Beaumont, having long ago purchased the beautiful piece of water called"
351,THE EXCURSION,"Loughrigg Tarn, on the banks of which he intended to build, I told him"
352,THE EXCURSION,that a person in Kendal who was attached to the place wished to purchase
353,THE EXCURSION,"it. Sir George, finding the possession of no use to him, consented"
354,THE EXCURSION,"to part with it, and placed the purchase-money--£20--at my disposal,"
355,THE EXCURSION,"for any local use which I thought proper. Accordingly, I resolved to"
356,THE EXCURSION,plant yew-trees in the churchyard; and had four pretty strong large oak
357,THE EXCURSION,"enclosures made, in each of which was planted, under my own eye, and"
358,THE EXCURSION,"principally if not entirely by my own hand, two young trees, with the"
359,THE EXCURSION,"intention of leaving the one that throve best to stand. Many years after,"
360,THE EXCURSION,"Mr. Barber, who will long be remembered in Grasmere, Mr. Greenwood (the"
361,THE EXCURSION,"chief landed proprietor), and myself, had four other enclosures made in"
362,THE EXCURSION,"the churchyard at our own expense, in each of which was planted a tree"
363,THE EXCURSION,"taken from its neighbour, and they all stand thriving admirably, the"
364,THE EXCURSION,fences having been removed as no longer necessary. May the trees be taken
365,THE EXCURSION,"care of hereafter, when we are all gone; and some of them will perhaps,"
366,THE EXCURSION,"at some far-distant time, rival in majesty the yew of Lorton, and those"
367,THE EXCURSION,"which I have described as growing at Borrowdale, where they are still to"
368,THE EXCURSION,be seen[E] in grand assemblage.
369,THE EXCURSION,
370,THE EXCURSION,And now for the persons that are selected as lying in the churchyard. But
371,THE EXCURSION,first for the individual whose grave is prepared to receive him.
372,THE EXCURSION,
373,THE EXCURSION,His story is here truly related. He was a schoolfellow of mine for some
374,THE EXCURSION,"years. He came to us when he was at least seventeen years of age, very"
375,THE EXCURSION,"tall, robust, and full grown. This prevented him from falling into the"
376,THE EXCURSION,"amusements and games of the school; consequently, he gave more time to"
377,THE EXCURSION,"books. He was not remarkably bright or quick, but by industry, he made"
378,THE EXCURSION,a progress more than respectable. His parents not being wealthy enough
379,THE EXCURSION,"to send him to college when he left Hawkshead, he became a schoolmaster,"
380,THE EXCURSION,with a view to prepare himself for holy orders. About this time he
381,THE EXCURSION,"fell in love, as related in the poem, and everything followed as there"
382,THE EXCURSION,"described, except that I do not know exactly when and where he died."
383,THE EXCURSION,The number of youths that came to Hawkshead School from the families of
384,THE EXCURSION,"the humble yeomanry, to be educated to a certain degree of scholarship,"
385,THE EXCURSION,"as a preparation for the church, was considerable, and the fortunes of"
386,THE EXCURSION,"those persons in after life various of course, and some not a little"
387,THE EXCURSION,remarkable. I have now one of this class in my eye who became an usher in
388,THE EXCURSION,"a preparatory school, and ended in making a large fortune. His manners,"
389,THE EXCURSION,"when he came to Hawkshead, were as uncouth as well could be; but he had"
390,THE EXCURSION,"good abilities, with skill to turn them to account; and when the master"
391,THE EXCURSION,"of the school, to which he was usher, died, he stept into his place and"
392,THE EXCURSION,became proprietor of the establishment. He contrived to manage it with
393,THE EXCURSION,"such address, and so much to the taste of what is called high society and"
394,THE EXCURSION,"the fashionable world, that no school of the kind, even till he retired,"
395,THE EXCURSION,"was in such high request. Ministers of State, the wealthiest gentry,"
396,THE EXCURSION,"and nobility of the first rank, vied with each other in bespeaking a"
397,THE EXCURSION,place for their sons in the seminary of this fortunate teacher.[F] In
398,THE EXCURSION,"the solitude of Grasmere, while living as a married man in a cottage"
399,THE EXCURSION,"of £8 per annum rent, I often used to smile at the tales which reached"
400,THE EXCURSION,me of the brilliant career of this quondam clown--for such in reality
401,THE EXCURSION,"he was, in manners, and appearance, before he was polished a little by"
402,THE EXCURSION,"attrition with gentlemen's sons trained at Hawkshead, rough and rude as"
403,THE EXCURSION,many of our juveniles were. Not 200 yards from the cottage in Grasmere
404,THE EXCURSION,"just mentioned, to which I retired, this gentleman, who many years"
405,THE EXCURSION,"afterwards purchased a small estate in the neighbourhood, is now erecting"
406,THE EXCURSION,"a boat-house, with an upper story to be resorted to as an entertaining"
407,THE EXCURSION,room when he and his associates may feel inclined to take their pastime
408,THE EXCURSION,on the lake. Every passenger will be disgusted with the sight of this
409,THE EXCURSION,"edifice, not merely as a tasteless thing in itself, but as utterly out of"
410,THE EXCURSION,"place, and peculiarly fitted, as far as it is observed (and it obtrudes"
411,THE EXCURSION,"itself on notice at every point of view), to mar the beauty and destroy"
412,THE EXCURSION,"the pastoral simplicity of the vale. For my own part, and that of my"
413,THE EXCURSION,"household, it is our utter detestation, standing by a shore to which,"
414,THE EXCURSION,"before the high road was made to pass that way, we used daily and hourly"
415,THE EXCURSION,"to repair for seclusion and for the shelter of a grove, under which I"
416,THE EXCURSION,composed many of my poems--_The Brothers_ especially; and for this reason
417,THE EXCURSION,we gave the grove that name.
418,THE EXCURSION,
419,THE EXCURSION,That which each man loved
420,THE EXCURSION,And prized in his peculiar nook of earth
421,THE EXCURSION,"Dies with him, or is changed."
422,THE EXCURSION,
423,THE EXCURSION,So much for my old schoolfellow and his exploits. I will only add
424,THE EXCURSION,"that, as the foundation has twice failed, from the Lake no doubt being"
425,THE EXCURSION,"intolerant of the intrusion, there is some ground for hoping that the"
426,THE EXCURSION,impertinent structure will not stand. It has been rebuilt in somewhat
427,THE EXCURSION,"better taste, and much as one wishes it away, it is not now so very"
428,THE EXCURSION,unsightly. The structure is an emblem of the man. Perseverance has
429,THE EXCURSION,"conquered difficulties, and given something of form and polish to"
430,THE EXCURSION,rudeness.[G]
431,THE EXCURSION,
432,THE EXCURSION,"The Miner, next described as having found his treasure after twice ten"
433,THE EXCURSION,"years of labour, lived in Paterdale, and the story is true to the"
434,THE EXCURSION,"letter. It seems to me, however, rather remarkable, that the strength of"
435,THE EXCURSION,"mind which had supported him through his long unrewarded labour, did not"
436,THE EXCURSION,enable him to bear its successful issue. Several times in the course of
437,THE EXCURSION,my life I have heard of sudden influxes of great wealth being followed
438,THE EXCURSION,"by derangement; and, in one instance, the shock of good fortune was"
439,THE EXCURSION,so great as to produce absolute idiotcy. But these all happened where
440,THE EXCURSION,"there had been little or no previous effort to acquire the riches, and"
441,THE EXCURSION,"therefore such a consequence might the more naturally be expected, than"
442,THE EXCURSION,"in the case of the solitary miner. In reviewing his story, one cannot but"
443,THE EXCURSION,regret that such perseverance was not sustained by a worthier object.
444,THE EXCURSION,"Archimedes leaped out of his bath and ran about the streets, proclaiming"
445,THE EXCURSION,his discovery in a transport of joy; but we are not told that he lost
446,THE EXCURSION,either his life or his senses in consequence.
447,THE EXCURSION,
448,THE EXCURSION,"The next character, to whom the priest is led by contrast with the"
449,THE EXCURSION,"resoluteness displayed by the foregoing, is taken from a person born and"
450,THE EXCURSION,"bred in Grasmere, by name Dawson; and whose talents, dispositions, and"
451,THE EXCURSION,"way of life, were such as are here delineated. I did not know him, but"
452,THE EXCURSION,all was fresh in memory when we settled at Grasmere in the beginning of
453,THE EXCURSION,the century. From this point the conversation leads to the mention of two
454,THE EXCURSION,"individuals, who, by their several fortunes, were, at different times,"
455,THE EXCURSION,driven to take refuge at the small and obscure town of Hawkshead on the
456,THE EXCURSION,skirt of these mountains. Their stories I had from the dear old dame with
457,THE EXCURSION,"whom, as a schoolboy, and afterwards, I lodged for nearly the space of"
458,THE EXCURSION,"ten years. The elder, the Jacobite, was named Drummond, and was of a high"
459,THE EXCURSION,"family in Scotland; the Hanoverian Whig bore the name of Vandeput, and"
460,THE EXCURSION,"might, perhaps, be a descendant of some Dutchman who had come over in the"
461,THE EXCURSION,"train of King William. At all events, his zeal was such, that he ruined"
462,THE EXCURSION,"himself by a contest for the representation of London or Westminster,"
463,THE EXCURSION,"undertaken to support his Party, and retired to this corner of the"
464,THE EXCURSION,"world, selected (as it had been by Drummond) for that obscurity which,"
465,THE EXCURSION,"since visiting the Lakes became fashionable, it has no longer retained."
466,THE EXCURSION,"So much was this region considered out of the way till a late period,"
467,THE EXCURSION,that persons who had fled from justice used often to resort hither for
468,THE EXCURSION,"concealment, and some were so bold as to not unfrequently make excursions"
469,THE EXCURSION,from the place of their retreat for the purpose of committing fresh
470,THE EXCURSION,offences. Such was particularly the case with two brothers of the name of
471,THE EXCURSION,"Weston, who took up their abode at Old Brathay, I think about seventy"
472,THE EXCURSION,"years ago. They were highwaymen, and lived there some time without being"
473,THE EXCURSION,"discovered, though it was known that they often disappeared, in a way,"
474,THE EXCURSION,"and upon errands, which could not be accounted for. Their horses were"
475,THE EXCURSION,"noticed as being of a choice breed, and I have heard from the Relph"
476,THE EXCURSION,"family, one of whom was a saddler in the town of Kendal, that they were"
477,THE EXCURSION,"curious in their saddles, and housings, and accoutrements of their"
478,THE EXCURSION,"horses. They, as I have heard, and as was universally believed, were, in"
479,THE EXCURSION,"the end, both taken and hanged."
480,THE EXCURSION,
481,THE EXCURSION,Tall was her stature; her complexion dark
482,THE EXCURSION,And saturnine.
483,THE EXCURSION,
484,THE EXCURSION,"This person lived at Town-end, and was almost our next neighbour. I have"
485,THE EXCURSION,little to notice concerning her beyond what is said in the poem. She
486,THE EXCURSION,"was a most striking instance how far a woman may surpass in talent, in"
487,THE EXCURSION,"knowledge, and culture of mind, those with and among whom she lives,"
488,THE EXCURSION,and yet fall below them in Christian virtues of the heart and spirit.
489,THE EXCURSION,"It seemed almost, and I say it with grief, that in proportion as she"
490,THE EXCURSION,"excelled in the one, she failed in the other. How frequently has one"
491,THE EXCURSION,"to observe in both sexes the same thing, and how mortifying is the"
492,THE EXCURSION,reflection!
493,THE EXCURSION,
494,THE EXCURSION,"As, on a sunny bank, a tender lamb"
495,THE EXCURSION,Lurks in safe shelter from the winds of March.
496,THE EXCURSION,
497,THE EXCURSION,"The story that follows was told to Mrs. Wordsworth and my sister, by"
498,THE EXCURSION,the sister of this unhappy young woman. Every particular was exactly
499,THE EXCURSION,"as I have related. The party was not known to me, though she lived at"
500,THE EXCURSION,Hawkshead; but it was after I left school. The clergyman who administered
501,THE EXCURSION,"comfort to her in her distress I knew well. Her sister, who told the"
502,THE EXCURSION,"story, was the wife of a leading yeoman in the vale of Grasmere, and"
503,THE EXCURSION,"they were an affectionate pair, and greatly respected by every one"
504,THE EXCURSION,"who knew them. Neither lived to be old; and their estate--which was,"
505,THE EXCURSION,"perhaps, the most considerable then in the vale, and was endeared to"
506,THE EXCURSION,"them by many remembrances of a salutary character, not easily understood"
507,THE EXCURSION,or sympathised with by those who are born to great affluence--passed to
508,THE EXCURSION,"their eldest son, according to the practice of these vales, who died soon"
509,THE EXCURSION,"after he came into possession. He was an amiable and promising youth,"
510,THE EXCURSION,"but was succeeded by an only brother, a good-natured man, who fell into"
511,THE EXCURSION,"habits of drinking, by which he gradually reduced his property; and the"
512,THE EXCURSION,"other day the last acre of it was sold, and his wife and children, and"
513,THE EXCURSION,"he himself still surviving, have very little left to live upon; which"
514,THE EXCURSION,"it would not, perhaps, have been worth while to record here, but that"
515,THE EXCURSION,"through all trials this woman has proved a model of patience, meekness,"
516,THE EXCURSION,"affectionate forbearance, and forgiveness. Their eldest son, who through"
517,THE EXCURSION,the vices of his father has thus been robbed of an ancient family
518,THE EXCURSION,"inheritance, was never heard to murmur or complain against the cause"
519,THE EXCURSION,"of their distress, and is now (1843) deservedly the chief prop of his"
520,THE EXCURSION,mother's hopes.
521,THE EXCURSION,
522,THE EXCURSION,The Clergyman and his family described at the beginning of the seventh
523,THE EXCURSION,"book were, during many years, our principal associates in the vale of"
524,THE EXCURSION,"Grasmere, unless I were to except our very nearest neighbours. I have"
525,THE EXCURSION,"entered so particularly into the main points of their history, that I"
526,THE EXCURSION,will barely testify in prose that--with the single exception of the
527,THE EXCURSION,"particulars of their journey to Grasmere, which, however, was exactly"
528,THE EXCURSION,copied from real life in another instance--the whole that I have said
529,THE EXCURSION,of them is as faithful to the truth as words can make it. There was
530,THE EXCURSION,"much talent in the family, and the eldest son was distinguished for"
531,THE EXCURSION,"poetical talent, of which a specimen is given in my notes to the Sonnets"
532,THE EXCURSION,"to the Duddon. Once, when in our cottage at Town-end I was talking with"
533,THE EXCURSION,"him about poetry, in the course of our conversation I presumed to find"
534,THE EXCURSION,"fault with the versification of Pope, of whom he was an enthusiastic"
535,THE EXCURSION,admirer. He defended him with a warmth that indicated much irritation;
536,THE EXCURSION,"nevertheless I would not abandon my point, and said, ""In compass and"
537,THE EXCURSION,"variety of sound your own versification surpasses his."" Never shall"
538,THE EXCURSION,I forget the change in his countenance and tone of voice: the storm
539,THE EXCURSION,"was laid in a moment; he no longer disputed my judgment, and I passed"
540,THE EXCURSION,"immediately in his mind, no doubt, for as great a critic as ever lived. I"
541,THE EXCURSION,"ought to add, he was a clergyman and a well-educated man, and his verbal"
542,THE EXCURSION,"memory was the most remarkable of any individual I have known, except a"
543,THE EXCURSION,"Mr. Archer, an Irishman, who lived several years in this neighbourhood,"
544,THE EXCURSION,"and who in this faculty was a prodigy: he afterwards became deranged, and"
545,THE EXCURSION,I fear continues so if alive.
546,THE EXCURSION,
547,THE EXCURSION,"Then follows the character of Robert Walker, for which see notes to the"
548,THE EXCURSION,Duddon.
549,THE EXCURSION,
550,THE EXCURSION,"That of the _Deaf Man_, whose epitaph may be seen in the churchyard at"
551,THE EXCURSION,"the head of Hawes Water, and whose qualities of mind and heart, and"
552,THE EXCURSION,"their benign influence in conjunction with his privation, I had from his"
553,THE EXCURSION,relatives on the spot.
554,THE EXCURSION,
555,THE EXCURSION,"The _Blind Man_, next commemorated, was John Gough, of Kendal, a man"
556,THE EXCURSION,"known, far beyond his neighbourhood, for his talents and attainments in"
557,THE EXCURSION,natural history and science.
558,THE EXCURSION,
559,THE EXCURSION,"Of the _Infant's Grave_ next noticed, I will only say, it is an exact"
560,THE EXCURSION,picture of what fell under my own observation; and all persons who are
561,THE EXCURSION,intimately acquainted with cottage life must often have observed like
562,THE EXCURSION,instances of the working of the domestic affections.
563,THE EXCURSION,
564,THE EXCURSION,A volley thrice repeated o'er the corse
565,THE EXCURSION,Let down into the hollow of that grave.
566,THE EXCURSION,
567,THE EXCURSION,"This young volunteer bore the name of Dawson, and was younger brother,"
568,THE EXCURSION,"if I am not mistaken, to the prodigal of whose character and fortunes"
569,THE EXCURSION,an account is given towards the beginning of the preceding book. The
570,THE EXCURSION,father of the family I knew well; he was a man of literary education and
571,THE EXCURSION,considerable experience in society--much beyond what was common among the
572,THE EXCURSION,inhabitants of the Vale. He had lived a good while in the Highlands of
573,THE EXCURSION,"Scotland as a manager of ironworks at Bunaw, and had acted as clerk to"
574,THE EXCURSION,"one of my predecessors in the office of Distributor of Stamps, when he"
575,THE EXCURSION,used to travel round the country collecting and bringing home the money
576,THE EXCURSION,"due to Government in gold, which it may be worth while to mention, for"
577,THE EXCURSION,"the sake of my friends, was deposited in the cell or iron closet under"
578,THE EXCURSION,"the west window, which still exists, with the iron doors that guarded the"
579,THE EXCURSION,"property. This, of course, was before the time of Bills and Notes. The"
580,THE EXCURSION,two sons of this person had no doubt been led by the knowledge of their
581,THE EXCURSION,"father to take more delight in scholarship, and had been accustomed, in"
582,THE EXCURSION,"their own minds, to take a wider view of social interests, than was usual"
583,THE EXCURSION,among their associates. The premature death of this gallant young man was
584,THE EXCURSION,"much lamented, and as an attendant upon the funeral, I myself witnessed"
585,THE EXCURSION,"the ceremony, and the effect of it as described in the poems."
586,THE EXCURSION,
587,THE EXCURSION,... Tradition tells
588,THE EXCURSION,"That, in Eliza's golden days, a Knight"
589,THE EXCURSION,Came on a war-horse....
590,THE EXCURSION,... The house is gone.
591,THE EXCURSION,
592,THE EXCURSION,The pillars of the gateway in front of the mansion remained when we
593,THE EXCURSION,first took up our abode at Grasmere. Two or three cottages still remain
594,THE EXCURSION,"which are called Nott Houses, from the name of the gentleman (I have"
595,THE EXCURSION,called him a knight) concerning whom these traditions survive. He was
596,THE EXCURSION,"the ancestor of the Knott family, formerly considerable proprietors in"
597,THE EXCURSION,"the district. What follows in the discourse of the Wanderer, upon the"
598,THE EXCURSION,"changes he had witnessed in rural life by the introduction of machinery,"
599,THE EXCURSION,is truly described from what I myself saw during my boyhood and early
600,THE EXCURSION,"youth, and from what was often told me by persons of this humble calling."
601,THE EXCURSION,"Happily, most happily, for these mountains, the mischief was diverted"
602,THE EXCURSION,"from the banks of their beautiful streams, and transferred to open and"
603,THE EXCURSION,"flat counties abounding in coal, where the agency of steam was found"
604,THE EXCURSION,much more effectual for carrying on those demoralising works. Had it not
605,THE EXCURSION,"been for this invention, long before the present time, every torrent and"
606,THE EXCURSION,"river in this district would have had its factory, large and populous"
607,THE EXCURSION,in proportion to the power of the water that could there be commanded.
608,THE EXCURSION,Parliament has interfered to prevent the night-work which was once
609,THE EXCURSION,"carried on in these mills as actively as during the day-time, and by"
610,THE EXCURSION,"necessity, still more perniciously; a sad disgrace to the proprietors and"
611,THE EXCURSION,to the nation which could so long tolerate such unnatural proceedings.
612,THE EXCURSION,
613,THE EXCURSION,"Reviewing, at this late period, 1843, what I put into the mouths of my"
614,THE EXCURSION,"interlocutors a few years after the commencement of the century, I grieve"
615,THE EXCURSION,"that so little progress has been made in diminishing the evils deplored,"
616,THE EXCURSION,or promoting the benefits of education which the Wanderer anticipates.
617,THE EXCURSION,The results of Lord Ashley's labours to defer the time when children
618,THE EXCURSION,"might legally be allowed to work in factories, and his endeavours to"
619,THE EXCURSION,"limit still further the hours of permitted labour, have fallen far"
620,THE EXCURSION,"short of his own humane wishes, and of those of every benevolent and"
621,THE EXCURSION,right-minded man who has carefully attended to this subject; and in
622,THE EXCURSION,the present session of Parliament (1843) Sir James Graham's attempt to
623,THE EXCURSION,establish a course of religious education among the children employed
624,THE EXCURSION,"in factories has been abandoned, in consequence of what might easily be"
625,THE EXCURSION,"foreseen, the vehement and turbulent opposition of the Dissenters; so"
626,THE EXCURSION,that for many years to come it may be thought expedient to leave the
627,THE EXCURSION,religious instruction of children entirely in the hands of the several
628,THE EXCURSION,"denominations of Christians in the Island, each body to work according"
629,THE EXCURSION,"to its own means and in its own way. Such is my own confidence, a"
630,THE EXCURSION,"confidence I share with many others of my most valued friends, in the"
631,THE EXCURSION,"superior advantages, both religious and social, which attend a course"

633,THE EXCURSION,"England, that I have no doubt, that if but once its members, lay and"
634,THE EXCURSION,"clerical, were duly sensible of those benefits, their Church would"
635,THE EXCURSION,"daily gain ground, and rapidly, upon every shape and fashion of Dissent;"
636,THE EXCURSION,"and in that case, a great majority in Parliament being sensible of"
637,THE EXCURSION,"these benefits, the Ministers of the country might be emboldened, were"
638,THE EXCURSION,"it necessary, to apply funds of the State to the support of education"
639,THE EXCURSION,"on church principles. Before I conclude, I cannot forbear noticing the"
640,THE EXCURSION,strenuous efforts made at this time in Parliament by so many persons
641,THE EXCURSION,to extend manufacturing and commercial industry at the expense of
642,THE EXCURSION,"agricultural, though we have recently had abundant proofs that the"
643,THE EXCURSION,apprehensions expressed by the Wanderer were not groundless.

645,THE EXCURSION,"I spake of mischief by the wise diffused,"
646,THE EXCURSION,With gladness thinking that the more it spreads
647,THE EXCURSION,"The healthier, the securer, we become;"
648,THE EXCURSION,Delusion which a moment may destroy!
649,THE EXCURSION,
650,THE EXCURSION,"The Chartists are well aware of this possibility, and cling to it with"
651,THE EXCURSION,"an ardour and perseverance which nothing, but wiser and more brotherly"
652,THE EXCURSION,"dealing towards the many, on the part of the wealthy few, can moderate or"
653,THE EXCURSION,remove.

656,THE EXCURSION,"We gazed, in silence hushed."

658,THE EXCURSION,The point here fixed upon in my imagination is half way up the northern
659,THE EXCURSION,"side of Loughrigg Fell, from which the Pastor and his companions are"
660,THE EXCURSION,"supposed to look upwards to the sky and mountain-tops, and round the"

670,THE EXCURSION,"wanderings and pass the Borders into his native country, where, as I"
671,THE EXCURSION,"hoped, he might witness, in the society of the Wanderer, some religious"
672,THE EXCURSION,"ceremony--a sacrament say, in the open fields, or a preaching among"
673,THE EXCURSION,"the mountains--which, by recalling to his mind the days of his early"
674,THE EXCURSION,"childhood, when he had been present on such occasions in company with"
675,THE EXCURSION,"his parents and nearest kindred, might have dissolved his heart into"
676,THE EXCURSION,"tenderness, and so done more towards restoring the Christian faith in"
677,THE EXCURSION,"which he had been educated, and, with that, contentedness and even"
678,THE EXCURSION,"cheerfulness of mind, and all that the Wanderer and Pastor by their"
679,THE EXCURSION,several effusions and addresses had been unable to effect. An issue like
680,THE EXCURSION,this was in my intentions. But alas!

690,THE EXCURSION,Although the Fenwick note to _The Excursion_ has been printed here in
691,THE EXCURSION,"full, extracts from it will be introduced as footnotes, in explanation of"
692,THE EXCURSION,certain passages of the poem. _The Excursion_ was written at intervals
693,THE EXCURSION,"between 1795 and 1814. The story of Margaret, in the first book, was"
694,THE EXCURSION,"begun at Racedown in 1795, and continued at Alfoxden in 1797-8. But"
695,THE EXCURSION,only two short fragments of the poem--the former in book first and the
696,THE EXCURSION,latter in book fourth (as indicated in the Fenwick note)--were written
697,THE EXCURSION,"before Wordsworth's arrival at Grasmere. There the poem was thought out,"
698,THE EXCURSION,"arranged, written down, altered, and re-arranged; the first part during"
699,THE EXCURSION,"his residence at Dove Cottage, the second and longer part at Allan Bank."
700,THE EXCURSION,The following extracts from Miss Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal show how
701,THE EXCURSION,laboriously her brother worked at this poem:--

729,THE EXCURSION,"Wednesday, 10th Feb.--""We read the first part of the poem, and were"

752,THE EXCURSION,These extracts--which will recall the laborious way in which he toiled
753,THE EXCURSION,over the poem _Michael_ (see vol. ii. p. 233)--all refer to the close of
754,THE EXCURSION,"the year 1801, and the beginning of the year 1802. It is impossible to"
755,THE EXCURSION,"find out, with exactness, what were the parts of _The Excursion_ which"
756,THE EXCURSION,"were then so carefully written, and so fastidiously altered--since ""The"
757,THE EXCURSION,"Pedlar"" was the Wordsworth household name for the entire poem, until"
758,THE EXCURSION,"it was recast for publication, at Allan Bank. But after February 1802"
759,THE EXCURSION,"he turned to other subjects of composition, chiefly lyrical, and laid"
760,THE EXCURSION,"aside ""The Pedlar"" for a time--his sister, at least, regarding it as"
761,THE EXCURSION,"""finished."" What was completed, however, did not, probably, extend beyond"
762,THE EXCURSION,"the story of the Wanderer, and perhaps a part of that of the Solitary."
763,THE EXCURSION,"The person, whose character gave rise to the Solitary, came to reside"
764,THE EXCURSION,at Grasmere not long after the Wordsworths settled there; but as the
765,THE EXCURSION,"Fenwick note expressly says that the poem was written ""_chiefly_ during"
766,THE EXCURSION,"our residence at Allan Bank,"" I do not think that more than the first two"

772,THE EXCURSION,"_The Excursion_ was included in all the collected editions of 1827,"
773,THE EXCURSION,"1832, 1836-7, 1840, 1845, 1849-50, in the Paris reprint of 1828, and in"
774,THE EXCURSION,the American edition by Henry Reed. It was also republished by itself
775,THE EXCURSION,"in 1836, 1844, and 1847. The textual changes in the several editions"
776,THE EXCURSION,were numerous and significant. The longest and most important passage in
777,THE EXCURSION,"the earlier ones, omitted after 1820, occurs at the close of the sixth"
778,THE EXCURSION,"book. Another (shorter) fragment, near the beginning of book seventh,"
779,THE EXCURSION,refers to the Sympson household at the Wytheburn parsonage. No edition
780,THE EXCURSION,"of _The Excursion_ has as yet been issued with adequate notes, either"
781,THE EXCURSION,"topographical or literary. The first book--""The Wanderer""--has, however,"
782,THE EXCURSION,"been annotated, both by Mr. H. H. Turner (published in Rivington's"
783,THE EXCURSION,"English School Classics), and also by the Rev. H. G. Robinson, Prebendary"

788,THE EXCURSION,
789,THE EXCURSION,"_August 14, 1814._"
790,THE EXCURSION,
791,THE EXCURSION,"""DEAR WORDSWORTH--I cannot tell you how pleased I was at the receipt of"
792,THE EXCURSION,the great armful of poetry which you have sent me; and to get it before
793,THE EXCURSION,"the rest of the world too! I have gone quite through with it, and was"
794,THE EXCURSION,thinking to have accomplished that pleasure a second time before I wrote
795,THE EXCURSION,"to thank you, but M. Burney came in the night (while we were out) and"
796,THE EXCURSION,"made holy theft of it, but we expect restitution in a day or two. It is"
797,THE EXCURSION,the noblest conversational poem I ever read--a day in Heaven. The part
798,THE EXCURSION,(or rather main body) which has left the sweetest odour on my memory (a
799,THE EXCURSION,bad term for the remains of an impression so recent) is the Tales of the
800,THE EXCURSION,"Churchyard; the only girl among seven brethren, born out of due time, and"
801,THE EXCURSION,"not duly taken away again,--the deaf man and the blind man; the Jacobite"
802,THE EXCURSION,"and the Hanoverian, whom antipathies reconcile; the Scarron-entry of"
803,THE EXCURSION,the rusticating parson upon his solitude;--these were all new to me
804,THE EXCURSION,"too. My having known the story of Margaret (at the beginning), a very"
805,THE EXCURSION,"old acquaintance, even as long back as when I saw you first at Stowey,"
806,THE EXCURSION,did not make her reappearance less fresh. I don't know what to pick out
807,THE EXCURSION,of this best of books upon the best subjects for partial naming. That
808,THE EXCURSION,gorgeous sunset[J] is famous; I think it must have been the identical one
809,THE EXCURSION,"we saw on Salisbury Plain five years ago, that drew Phillips from the"
810,THE EXCURSION,"card-table, where he had sat from rise of that luminary to its unequalled"
811,THE EXCURSION,set; but neither he nor I had gifted eyes to see those symbols of common
812,THE EXCURSION,"things glorified, such as the prophets saw them in that sunset--the"
813,THE EXCURSION,"wheel, the potter's clay, the wash-pot, the wine-press, the almond-tree"
814,THE EXCURSION,"rod, the basket of figs, the fourfold visaged head, the throne, and Him"
815,THE EXCURSION,"that sat thereon. One feeling I was particularly struck with, as what"
816,THE EXCURSION,I recognised so very lately at Harrow Church on entering in it after a
817,THE EXCURSION,"hot and secular day's pleasure, the instantaneous coolness and calming,"
818,THE EXCURSION,almost transforming properties of a country church just entered; a
819,THE EXCURSION,"certain fragrance which it has, either from its holiness, or being kept"
820,THE EXCURSION,"shut all the week, or the air that is let in being pure country, exactly"
821,THE EXCURSION,what you have reduced into words; but I am feeling that which I can-not
822,THE EXCURSION,"express. Reading your lines about it fixed me for a time, a monument in"
823,THE EXCURSION,"Harrow Church. Do you know it? with its fine long spire, white as washed"
824,THE EXCURSION,"marble, to be seen, by vantage of its high site, as far as Salisbury"
825,THE EXCURSION,"spire itself almost."""

931,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"It may be proper to state whence the poem, of which _The Excursion_ is"
932,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"a part, derives its Title of THE RECLUSE.--Several years ago, when the"
933,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"Author retired to his native mountains, with the hope of being enabled to"
934,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"construct a literary Work that might live, it was a reasonable thing that"
935,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"he should take a review of his own mind, and examine how far Nature and"
936,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,Education had qualified him for such employment. As subsidiary to this
937,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"preparation, he undertook to record, in verse, the origin and progress"
938,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"of his own powers, as far as he was acquainted with them. That Work,[A]"
939,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"addressed to a dear Friend, most distinguished for his knowledge and"
940,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"genius, and to whom the Author's Intellect is deeply indebted, has been"
941,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,long finished; and the result of the investigation which gave rise to it
942,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"was a determination to compose a philosophical poem, containing views of"

947,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,hope that his faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the
948,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,arduous labour which he had proposed to himself; and the two Works have
949,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"the same kind of relation to each other, if he may so express himself,"
950,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,as the ante-chapel has to the body of a gothic church. Continuing this
951,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"allusion, he may be permitted to add, that his minor Pieces, which have"
952,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"been long before the Public, when they shall be properly arranged,[N]"
953,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,will be found by the attentive Reader to have such connection with the
954,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,"main Work as may give them claim to be likened to the little cells,"

959,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,if he had not thought that the labour bestowed by him upon what he

969,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,It is not the Author's intention formally to announce a system: it was
970,PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1814,more animating to him to proceed in a different course; and if he shall

1148,ARGUMENT,A surface dappled o'er with shadows flung                      5

1188,ARGUMENT,Graceful support; his countenance as he stood

1203,ARGUMENT,He loved me; from a swarm of rosy boys
1204,ARGUMENT,"Singled out me, as he in sport would say,"
1205,ARGUMENT,"For my grave looks, too thoughtful for my years."

1245,ARGUMENT,"And some small portion of his eloquent speech,"
1246,ARGUMENT,And something that may serve to set in view
1247,ARGUMENT,"The feeling pleasures of his loneliness,                     100"
1248,ARGUMENT,"His observations, and the thoughts his mind[18]"
1249,ARGUMENT,Had dealt with--I will here record in verse;
1250,ARGUMENT,"Which, if with truth it correspond, and sink"
1251,ARGUMENT,"Or rise as venerable Nature leads,"
1252,ARGUMENT,The high and tender Muses shall accept                       105
1253,ARGUMENT,"With gracious smile, deliberately pleased,"
1254,ARGUMENT,And listening Time reward with sacred praise.
1255,ARGUMENT,
1256,ARGUMENT,Among the hills of Athol he was born;
1257,ARGUMENT,"Where,[19] on a small hereditary farm,"
1258,ARGUMENT,"An unproductive slip of rugged ground,                       110"
1259,ARGUMENT,"His Parents, with their numerous offspring, dwelt;[20]"
1260,ARGUMENT,"A virtuous household, though exceeding poor!"
1261,ARGUMENT,"Pure livers were they all, austere and grave,"
1262,ARGUMENT,And fearing God;[AB] the very children taught
1263,ARGUMENT,"Stern self-respect, a reverence for God's word,              115"
1264,ARGUMENT,"And an habitual piety, maintained"
1265,ARGUMENT,With strictness scarcely known on English ground.
1266,ARGUMENT,
1267,ARGUMENT,"From his sixth year, the Boy of whom I speak,"
1268,ARGUMENT,"In summer, tended cattle on the hills;"
1269,ARGUMENT,"But, through the inclement and the perilous days             120"
1270,ARGUMENT,"Of long-continuing winter, he repaired,"
1271,ARGUMENT,"Equipped with satchel, to a school, that stood[21]"
1272,ARGUMENT,"Sole building on a mountain's dreary edge,"
1273,ARGUMENT,"Remote from view[22] of city spire, or sound"
1274,ARGUMENT,Of minster clock! From that bleak tenement                   125
1275,ARGUMENT,"He, many an evening, to his distant home"
1276,ARGUMENT,"In solitude returning, saw the hills"
1277,ARGUMENT,Grow larger in the darkness; all alone
1278,ARGUMENT,"Beheld the stars come out above his head,"
1279,ARGUMENT,"And travelled through the wood, with no one near"
1280,ARGUMENT,To whom he might confess the things he saw.                  131
1281,ARGUMENT,
1282,ARGUMENT,So the foundations of his mind were laid.
1283,ARGUMENT,"In such communion, not from terror free,[AC]"
1284,ARGUMENT,"While yet a child, and long before his time,"
1285,ARGUMENT,Had he[23] perceived the presence and the power              135
1286,ARGUMENT,Of greatness; and deep feelings had impressed
1287,ARGUMENT,So vividly great objects that they lay
1288,ARGUMENT,"Upon his mind like substances, whose presence"
1289,ARGUMENT,Perplexed the bodily sense. He had received[24]
1290,ARGUMENT,"[25]A precious gift; for, as he grew in years,               140"
1291,ARGUMENT,With these impressions would he still compare
1292,ARGUMENT,"All his remembrances, thoughts, shapes, and forms;"
1293,ARGUMENT,"And, being still unsatisfied with aught"
1294,ARGUMENT,"Of dimmer character, he thence attained"
1295,ARGUMENT,An active power to fasten images                             145
1296,ARGUMENT,Upon his brain; and on their pictured lines
1297,ARGUMENT,"Intensely brooded, even till they acquired"
1298,ARGUMENT,"The liveliness of dreams.[AD] Nor did he fail,"
1299,ARGUMENT,"While yet a child, with a child's eagerness"
1300,ARGUMENT,Incessantly to turn his ear and eye                          150
1301,ARGUMENT,On all things which the moving seasons brought
1302,ARGUMENT,To feed such appetite--nor this alone
1303,ARGUMENT,Appeased his yearning:--in the after-day
1304,ARGUMENT,"Of boyhood, many an hour in caves forlorn,"
1305,ARGUMENT,And 'mid the hollow depths of naked crags                    155
1306,ARGUMENT,"He sate, and even in their fixed lineaments,"
1307,ARGUMENT,"Or from the power of a peculiar eye,"
1308,ARGUMENT,"Or by creative feeling overborne,"
1309,ARGUMENT,"Or by predominance of thought oppressed,"
1310,ARGUMENT,Even in their fixed and steady lineaments                    160
1311,ARGUMENT,"He traced an ebbing and a flowing mind,"
1312,ARGUMENT,Expression ever varying!
1313,ARGUMENT,"Thus informed,"
1314,ARGUMENT,He had small need of books; for many a tale
1315,ARGUMENT,"Traditionary, round the mountains hung,"
1316,ARGUMENT,"And many a legend, peopling the dark woods,                  165"
1317,ARGUMENT,"Nourished Imagination in her growth,"
1318,ARGUMENT,And gave the Mind that apprehensive power
1319,ARGUMENT,By which she is made quick to recognise
1320,ARGUMENT,The moral properties and scope of things.
1321,ARGUMENT,"But eagerly he read, and read again,                         170"
1322,ARGUMENT,Whate'er the minister's old shelf supplied;
1323,ARGUMENT,"The life and death of martyrs, who sustained,"
1324,ARGUMENT,"With will inflexible, those fearful pangs"
1325,ARGUMENT,Triumphantly displayed in records left
1326,ARGUMENT,"Of persecution, and the Covenant--times                      175"
1327,ARGUMENT,Whose echo rings through Scotland to this hour!
1328,ARGUMENT,"And there, by lucky hap, had been preserved"
1329,ARGUMENT,"A straggling volume, torn and incomplete,"
1330,ARGUMENT,"That left half-told[AE] the preternatural tale,"
1331,ARGUMENT,"Romance of giants, chronicle of fiends,                      180"
1332,ARGUMENT,Profuse in garniture of wooden cuts
1333,ARGUMENT,"Strange and uncouth; dire faces, figures dire,"
1334,ARGUMENT,"Sharp-kneed, sharp elbowed, and lean-ankled too,"
1335,ARGUMENT,With long and ghostly shanks--forms which once seen
1336,ARGUMENT,Could never be forgotten!
1337,ARGUMENT,"In his heart,                     185"
1338,ARGUMENT,"Where Fear sate thus, a cherished visitant,"
1339,ARGUMENT,Was wanting yet the pure delight of love
1340,ARGUMENT,"By sound diffused, or by the breathing air,[AF]"
1341,ARGUMENT,"Or by the silent looks of happy things,[AG]"
1342,ARGUMENT,Or flowing from the universal face                           190
1343,ARGUMENT,Of earth and sky. But he had felt the power
1344,ARGUMENT,"Of Nature, and already was prepared,"
1345,ARGUMENT,"By his intense conceptions, to receive"
1346,ARGUMENT,"Deeply the lesson deep of love which he,"
1347,ARGUMENT,"Whom Nature, by whatever means, has taught                   195"
1348,ARGUMENT,"To feel intensely, cannot but receive."
1349,ARGUMENT,
1350,ARGUMENT,Such was the Boy--but for the growing Youth
1351,ARGUMENT,"What soul was his, when, from the naked top"
1352,ARGUMENT,"Of some bold headland, he beheld the sun[26]"
1353,ARGUMENT,"Rise up, and bathe the world in light![AH] He looked--"
1354,ARGUMENT,"Ocean and earth, the solid frame of earth                    201"
1355,ARGUMENT,"And ocean's liquid mass, in gladness lay"
1356,ARGUMENT,"Beneath him[AI]:--Far and wide the clouds were touched,"
1357,ARGUMENT,And in their silent faces could he read[27]
1358,ARGUMENT,"Unutterable love. Sound needed none,                         205"
1359,ARGUMENT,Nor any voice of joy;[AJ] his spirit drank
1360,ARGUMENT,"The spectacle: sensation, soul, and form."
1361,ARGUMENT,All melted into him; they swallowed up
1362,ARGUMENT,"His animal being; in them did he live,"
1363,ARGUMENT,And by them did he live; they were his life.                 210
1364,ARGUMENT,"In such access of mind, in such high hour"
1365,ARGUMENT,"Of visitation from the living God,"
1366,ARGUMENT,Thought was not; in enjoyment it expired.
1367,ARGUMENT,"No thanks he breathed, he proffered no request;"
1368,ARGUMENT,Rapt into still communion that transcends                    215
1369,ARGUMENT,"The imperfect offices of prayer and praise,"
1370,ARGUMENT,His mind was a thanksgiving to the power
1371,ARGUMENT,That made him; it was blessedness and love!
1372,ARGUMENT,
1373,ARGUMENT,"A Herdsman on the lonely mountain tops,"
1374,ARGUMENT,"Such intercourse was his, and in this sort                   220"
1375,ARGUMENT,Was his existence oftentimes _possessed_.
1376,ARGUMENT,"O then how beautiful, how bright, appeared"
1377,ARGUMENT,The written promise! Early had he learned[28]
1378,ARGUMENT,To reverence the volume that[29] displays
1379,ARGUMENT,"The mystery, the life which cannot die;                      225"
1380,ARGUMENT,But in the mountains did he _feel_ his faith.
1381,ARGUMENT,"All things, responsive to the writing, there[30]"
1382,ARGUMENT,"Breathed immortality, revolving life,"
1383,ARGUMENT,And greatness still revolving; infinite:
1384,ARGUMENT,There littleness was not; the least of things                230
1385,ARGUMENT,Seemed infinite; and there his spirit shaped
1386,ARGUMENT,"Her prospects, nor did he believe,--he _saw_."
1387,ARGUMENT,What wonder if his being thus became
1388,ARGUMENT,"Sublime and comprehensive! Low desires,"
1389,ARGUMENT,Low thoughts had there no place; yet was his heart
1390,ARGUMENT,"Lowly; for he was meek in gratitude,                         236"
1391,ARGUMENT,"Oft as he called those ecstasies to mind,"
1392,ARGUMENT,And whence they flowed; and from them he acquired
1393,ARGUMENT,"Wisdom, which works thro' patience; thence he learned"
1394,ARGUMENT,In oft-recurring hours[31] of sober thought                  240
1395,ARGUMENT,"To look on Nature with a humble heart,"
1396,ARGUMENT,"Self-questioned where it did not understand,"
1397,ARGUMENT,And with a superstitious eye of love.
1398,ARGUMENT,
1399,ARGUMENT,So passed the time; yet to the nearest town[32]
1400,ARGUMENT,He duly went with what small overplus                        245
1401,ARGUMENT,"His earnings might supply, and brought away"
1402,ARGUMENT,The book that[33] most had tempted his desires
1403,ARGUMENT,While at the stall he read. Among the hills
1404,ARGUMENT,"He gazed upon that mighty orb of song,"
1405,ARGUMENT,"The divine Milton.[AK] Lore of different kind,               250"
1406,ARGUMENT,"The annual savings of a toilsome life,"
1407,ARGUMENT,His School-master[34] supplied; books that explain
1408,ARGUMENT,The purer elements of truth involved
1409,ARGUMENT,"In lines and numbers, and, by charm severe,"
1410,ARGUMENT,(Especially perceived where nature droops                    255
1411,ARGUMENT,And feeling is suppressed) preserve the mind
1412,ARGUMENT,Busy in solitude and poverty.
1413,ARGUMENT,These occupations oftentimes deceived
1414,ARGUMENT,"The listless hours, while in the hollow vale,"
1415,ARGUMENT,"Hollow and green, he lay on the green turf                   260"
1416,ARGUMENT,"In pensive idleness. What could he do,"
1417,ARGUMENT,"Thus daily thirsting, in that lonesome life"
1418,ARGUMENT,"With blind endeavours?[35] Yet, still uppermost,"
1419,ARGUMENT,"Nature was at his heart as if he felt,"
1420,ARGUMENT,"Though yet he knew not how, a wasting power                  265"
1421,ARGUMENT,In all things that[36] from her sweet influence
1422,ARGUMENT,"Might tend to wean him. Therefore with her hues,"
1423,ARGUMENT,"Her forms, and with the spirit of her forms,"
1424,ARGUMENT,He clothed the nakedness of austere truth.
1425,ARGUMENT,While yet he lingered in the rudiments                       270
1426,ARGUMENT,"Of science, and among her simplest laws,"
1427,ARGUMENT,"His triangles--they were the stars of heaven,"
1428,ARGUMENT,The silent stars! Oft did he take delight
1429,ARGUMENT,To measure the altitude[37] of some tall crag
1430,ARGUMENT,"That[38] is the eagle's birth-place, or some peak            275"
1431,ARGUMENT,"Familiar with forgotten years, that shows"
1432,ARGUMENT,"Inscribed upon its visionary sides,[39]"
1433,ARGUMENT,"The history of many a winter storm,"
1434,ARGUMENT,Or obscure records of the path of fire.[AL]
1435,ARGUMENT,
1436,ARGUMENT,"And thus before his eighteenth year was told,              280"
1437,ARGUMENT,Accumulated feelings pressed his heart
1438,ARGUMENT,With still increasing weight;[40] he was o'erpowered
1439,ARGUMENT,By Nature; by the turbulence subdued
1440,ARGUMENT,"Of his own mind; by mystery and hope,"
1441,ARGUMENT,And the first virgin passion of a soul                       285
1442,ARGUMENT,Communing with the glorious universe.[AM]
1443,ARGUMENT,Full often wished he that the winds might rage
1444,ARGUMENT,When they were silent: far more fondly now
1445,ARGUMENT,Than in his earlier season did he love
1446,ARGUMENT,Tempestuous nights--the conflict and the sounds              290
1447,ARGUMENT,That live in darkness. From his intellect
1448,ARGUMENT,And from the stillness of abstracted thought
1449,ARGUMENT,"He asked repose; and, failing oft to win[41]"
1450,ARGUMENT,"The peace required, he scanned the laws of light"
1451,ARGUMENT,"Amid the roar of torrents, where they send                   295"
1452,ARGUMENT,From hollow clefts up to the clearer air
1453,ARGUMENT,"A cloud of mist, that smitten by the sun"
1454,ARGUMENT,"Varies its rainbow hues.[42] But vainly thus,"
1455,ARGUMENT,"And vainly by all other means, he strove"
1456,ARGUMENT,To mitigate the fever of his heart.                          300
1457,ARGUMENT,
1458,ARGUMENT,"In dreams, in study, and in ardent thought,"
1459,ARGUMENT,Thus was he reared; much wanting to assist
1460,ARGUMENT,"The growth of intellect, yet gaining more,[43]"
1461,ARGUMENT,And every moral feeling of his soul
1462,ARGUMENT,"Strengthened and braced, by breathing in content             305"
1463,ARGUMENT,"The keen, the wholesome, air of poverty,"
1464,ARGUMENT,And drinking from the well of homely life.[AN]
1465,ARGUMENT,"--But, from past liberty, and tried restraints,"
1466,ARGUMENT,He now was summoned to select the course
1467,ARGUMENT,Of humble industry that[44] promised best                    310
1468,ARGUMENT,To yield him no unworthy maintenance.
1469,ARGUMENT,"Urged by his Mother, he essayed to teach"
1470,ARGUMENT,A village-school--but wandering thoughts were then
1471,ARGUMENT,A misery to him; and the Youth resigned[45]
1472,ARGUMENT,A task he was unable to perform.                             315
1473,ARGUMENT,
1474,ARGUMENT,"That stern yet kindly Spirit,[AO] who constrains"
1475,ARGUMENT,"The Savoyard to quit his naked rocks,"
1476,ARGUMENT,"The free-born Swiss to leave his narrow vales,"
1477,ARGUMENT,(Spirit attached to regions mountainous
1478,ARGUMENT,Like their own stedfast clouds) did now impel                320
1479,ARGUMENT,His restless mind to look abroad with hope.
1480,ARGUMENT,"--An irksome drudgery seems it to plod on,"
1481,ARGUMENT,"Through hot and dusty ways, or pelting storm,"
1482,ARGUMENT,"A vagrant Merchant under a heavy load,"
1483,ARGUMENT,"Bent as he moves, and needing frequent rest;[46]             325"
1484,ARGUMENT,Yet do such travellers find their own delight;
1485,ARGUMENT,"And their hard service, deemed debasing now,"
1486,ARGUMENT,Gained merited respect in simpler times;
1487,ARGUMENT,"When squire, and priest, and they who round them dwelt"
1488,ARGUMENT,In rustic sequestration--all dependent                       330
1489,ARGUMENT,"Upon the PEDLAR'S toil--supplied their wants,"
1490,ARGUMENT,"Or pleased their fancies, with the wares he brought."
1491,ARGUMENT,Not ignorant was the Youth that still no few
1492,ARGUMENT,Of his adventurous countrymen were led
1493,ARGUMENT,By perseverance in this track of life                        335
1494,ARGUMENT,To competence and ease:--to him it offered[47]
1495,ARGUMENT,Attractions manifold;--and this he chose.
1496,ARGUMENT,--His Parents on the enterprise bestowed[48]
1497,ARGUMENT,"Their farewell benediction, but with hearts"
1498,ARGUMENT,Foreboding evil. From his native hills                       340
1499,ARGUMENT,"He wandered far; much did he see of men,[AP]"
1500,ARGUMENT,"Their manners, their enjoyments, and pursuits,"
1501,ARGUMENT,Their passions and their feelings; chiefly those
1502,ARGUMENT,"Essential and eternal in the heart,"
1503,ARGUMENT,"That,[49] 'mid the simpler forms of rural life,              345"
1504,ARGUMENT,"Exist more simple in their elements,"
1505,ARGUMENT,"And speak a plainer language.[AQ] In the woods,"
1506,ARGUMENT,"A lone Enthusiast, and among the fields,"
1507,ARGUMENT,"Itinerant in this labour, he had passed"
1508,ARGUMENT,The better portion of his time; and there                    350
1509,ARGUMENT,Spontaneously had his affections thriven
1510,ARGUMENT,"Amid the bounties of the year, the peace"
1511,ARGUMENT,And liberty of nature;[50] there he kept
1512,ARGUMENT,In solitude and solitary thought
1513,ARGUMENT,His mind in a just equipoise of love.                        355
1514,ARGUMENT,"Serene it was, unclouded by the cares"
1515,ARGUMENT,"Of ordinary life; unvexed, unwarped"
1516,ARGUMENT,"By partial bondage. In his steady course,"
1517,ARGUMENT,"No piteous revolutions had he felt,"
1518,ARGUMENT,No wild varieties of joy and grief.                          360
1519,ARGUMENT,"Unoccupied by sorrow of its own,"
1520,ARGUMENT,"His heart lay open; and, by nature tuned"
1521,ARGUMENT,And constant disposition of his thoughts
1522,ARGUMENT,"To sympathy with man, he was alive"
1523,ARGUMENT,"To all that was enjoyed where'er he went,                    365"
1524,ARGUMENT,"And all that was endured; for, in himself"
1525,ARGUMENT,"Happy, and quiet in his cheerfulness,"
1526,ARGUMENT,He had no painful pressure from without
1527,ARGUMENT,That made him turn aside from wretchedness
1528,ARGUMENT,With coward fears. He could _afford_ to suffer               370
1529,ARGUMENT,With those whom he saw suffer. Hence it came
1530,ARGUMENT,"That in our best experience he was rich,"
1531,ARGUMENT,And in the wisdom of our daily life.
1532,ARGUMENT,"For hence, minutely, in his various rounds,"
1533,ARGUMENT,He had observed the progress and decay                       375
1534,ARGUMENT,"Of many minds, of minds and bodies too;"
1535,ARGUMENT,The history of many families;
1536,ARGUMENT,How they had prospered; how they were o'erthrown
1537,ARGUMENT,"By passion or mischance, or such misrule"
1538,ARGUMENT,Among the unthinking masters of the earth                    380
1539,ARGUMENT,As makes the nations groan.
1540,ARGUMENT,This active course
1541,ARGUMENT,He followed till provision for his wants
1542,ARGUMENT,Had been obtained;--the Wanderer then resolved[51]
1543,ARGUMENT,"To pass the remnant of his days, untasked"
1544,ARGUMENT,"With needless services, from hardship free.                  385"
1545,ARGUMENT,"His calling laid aside, he lived at ease:"
1546,ARGUMENT,But still he loved to pace the public roads
1547,ARGUMENT,"And the wild paths; and, by the summer's warmth"
1548,ARGUMENT,"Invited, often would he leave his home"
1549,ARGUMENT,"And journey far, revisiting the scenes                       390"
1550,ARGUMENT,That to his memory were most endeared.[52]
1551,ARGUMENT,"--Vigorous in health, of hopeful spirits, undamped[53]"
1552,ARGUMENT,By worldly-mindedness or anxious care;
1553,ARGUMENT,"Observant, studious, thoughtful, and refreshed"
1554,ARGUMENT,By knowledge gathered up from day to day;                    395
1555,ARGUMENT,Thus had he lived a long and innocent life.
1556,ARGUMENT,
1557,ARGUMENT,"The Scottish Church, both on himself and those"
1558,ARGUMENT,"With whom from childhood he grew up, had held"
1559,ARGUMENT,The strong hand of her purity; and still
1560,ARGUMENT,Had watched him with an unrelenting eye.                     400
1561,ARGUMENT,This he remembered in his riper age
1562,ARGUMENT,"With gratitude, and reverential thoughts."
1563,ARGUMENT,"But by the native vigour of his mind,"
1564,ARGUMENT,"By his habitual wanderings out of doors,"
1565,ARGUMENT,"By loneliness, and goodness, and kind works,                 405"
1566,ARGUMENT,"Whate'er, in docile childhood or in youth,"
1567,ARGUMENT,He had imbibed of fear or darker thought
1568,ARGUMENT,"Was melted all away; so true was this,"
1569,ARGUMENT,That sometimes his religion seemed to me
1570,ARGUMENT,"Self-taught, as of a dreamer in the woods;                   410"
1571,ARGUMENT,Who to the model of his own pure heart
1572,ARGUMENT,"Shaped[54] his belief, as grace divine inspired,"
1573,ARGUMENT,And[55] human reason dictated with awe.
1574,ARGUMENT,--And surely never did there live on earth
1575,ARGUMENT,A man of kindlier nature. The rough sports                   415
1576,ARGUMENT,And teasing ways of children vexed not him;
1577,ARGUMENT,[56]Indulgent listener was he to the tongue
1578,ARGUMENT,"Of garrulous age; nor did the sick man's tale,"
1579,ARGUMENT,"To his fraternal sympathy addressed,"
1580,ARGUMENT,Obtain reluctant hearing.
1581,ARGUMENT,Plain his garb;                  420
1582,ARGUMENT,"Such as might suit a rustic Sire, prepared"
1583,ARGUMENT,For sabbath duties; yet he was a man
1584,ARGUMENT,Whom no one could have passed without remark.
1585,ARGUMENT,Active and nervous was his gait; his limbs
1586,ARGUMENT,And his whole figure breathed intelligence.                  425
1587,ARGUMENT,Time had compressed the freshness of his cheek
1588,ARGUMENT,"Into a narrower circle of deep red,"
1589,ARGUMENT,"But had not tamed his eye;[AR] that, under brows"
1590,ARGUMENT,"Shaggy and grey, had meanings which it brought"
1591,ARGUMENT,"From years of youth;[AS] which, like a Being made            430"
1592,ARGUMENT,"Of many Beings, he had wondrous skill"
1593,ARGUMENT,"To blend with knowledge of the years to come,"
1594,ARGUMENT,"Human, or such as lie beyond the grave."
1595,ARGUMENT,
1596,ARGUMENT,*       *       *       *       *
1597,ARGUMENT,
1598,ARGUMENT,So was He framed; and such his course of life
1599,ARGUMENT,"Who now, with no appendage but a staff,                      435"
1600,ARGUMENT,"The prized memorial of relinquished toils,"
1601,ARGUMENT,"Upon that cottage-bench reposed his limbs,"
1602,ARGUMENT,"Screened from the sun. Supine the Wanderer lay,"
1603,ARGUMENT,"His eyes as if in drowsiness half shut,"
1604,ARGUMENT,The shadows of the breezy elms above                         440
1605,ARGUMENT,Dappling his face. He had not heard the sound
1606,ARGUMENT,"Of my approaching steps, and in the shade"
1607,ARGUMENT,Unnoticed did I stand some minutes' space.[57]
1608,ARGUMENT,"At length I hailed him, seeing that his hat"
1609,ARGUMENT,"Was moist with water-drops, as if the brim                   445"
1610,ARGUMENT,"Had newly scooped a running stream. He rose,"
1611,ARGUMENT,And ere our lively greeting into peace
1612,ARGUMENT,"Had settled, ""'Tis,"" said I,[58] ""a burning day:"
1613,ARGUMENT,"My lips are parched with thirst, but you, it seems,[59]"
1614,ARGUMENT,"Have somewhere found relief."" He, at the word,               450"
1615,ARGUMENT,"Pointing towards a sweet-briar, bade me climb"
1616,ARGUMENT,The fence where that aspiring shrub looked out
1617,ARGUMENT,Upon the public way.[60] It was a plot
1618,ARGUMENT,"Of garden ground run wild, its matted weeds"
1619,ARGUMENT,"Marked with the steps of those, whom, as they passed,"
1620,ARGUMENT,"The gooseberry trees that shot in long lank slips,           456"
1621,ARGUMENT,"Or currants, hanging from their leafless stems,"
1622,ARGUMENT,"In scanty strings, had tempted to o'erleap[61]"
1623,ARGUMENT,"The broken wall. I looked around, and there,"
1624,ARGUMENT,Where two tall hedge-rows of thick alder boughs              460
1625,ARGUMENT,"Joined in a cold damp nook, espied a well"
1626,ARGUMENT,Shrouded with willow-flowers and plumy fern.
1627,ARGUMENT,"My thirst I slaked, and, from the cheerless spot"
1628,ARGUMENT,"Withdrawing, straightway to the shade returned"
1629,ARGUMENT,Where sate the old Man on the cottage-bench;                 465
1630,ARGUMENT,"And, while, beside him, with uncovered head,"
1631,ARGUMENT,"I yet was standing, freely to respire,"
1632,ARGUMENT,"And cool my temples in the fanning air,"
1633,ARGUMENT,"Thus did he speak. ""I see around me here"
1634,ARGUMENT,"Things which you cannot see: we die, my Friend,              470"
1635,ARGUMENT,"Nor we alone, but that which each man loved"
1636,ARGUMENT,And prized in his peculiar nook of earth
1637,ARGUMENT,"Dies with him, or is changed; and very soon"
1638,ARGUMENT,Even of the good is no memorial left.[AT]
1639,ARGUMENT,"--The Poets, in their elegies and songs                      475"
1640,ARGUMENT,"Lamenting the departed, call the groves,"
1641,ARGUMENT,"They call upon the hills and streams to mourn,[AU]"
1642,ARGUMENT,"And senseless rocks; nor idly; for they speak,"
1643,ARGUMENT,"In these their invocations, with a voice"
1644,ARGUMENT,Obedient to the strong creative power                        480
1645,ARGUMENT,Of human passion. Sympathies there are
1646,ARGUMENT,"More tranquil, yet perhaps of kindred birth,"
1647,ARGUMENT,"That steal upon the meditative mind,"
1648,ARGUMENT,"And grow with thought. Beside yon spring I stood,"
1649,ARGUMENT,And eyed its waters till we seemed to feel                   485
1650,ARGUMENT,"One sadness, they and I. For them a bond"
1651,ARGUMENT,Of brotherhood is broken: time has been
1652,ARGUMENT,"When, every day, the touch of human hand"
1653,ARGUMENT,Dislodged the natural sleep that binds them up
1654,ARGUMENT,In mortal stillness; and they ministered                     490
1655,ARGUMENT,"To human comfort. Stooping down[62] to drink,"
1656,ARGUMENT,Upon the slimy foot-stone I espied
1657,ARGUMENT,"The useless fragment of a wooden bowl,"
1658,ARGUMENT,"Green with the moss of years, and subject only"
1659,ARGUMENT,To the soft handling of the elements:                        495
1660,ARGUMENT,There let it lie--how foolish are such thoughts!
1661,ARGUMENT,Forgive them;--never--never did my steps
1662,ARGUMENT,Approach this door but she who dwelt within[63]
1663,ARGUMENT,"A daughter's welcome gave me, and I loved her"
1664,ARGUMENT,"As my own child. Oh, Sir! the good die first,[AV]            500"
1665,ARGUMENT,And they whose hearts are dry as summer dust
1666,ARGUMENT,Burn to the socket. Many a passenger
1667,ARGUMENT,"Hath blessed poor Margaret for her gentle looks,"
1668,ARGUMENT,When she upheld the cool refreshment drawn
1669,ARGUMENT,From that forsaken spring; and no one came                   505
1670,ARGUMENT,But he was welcome; no one went away
1671,ARGUMENT,"But that it seemed she loved him. She is dead,"
1672,ARGUMENT,"The light extinguished of her lonely hut,"
1673,ARGUMENT,"The hut itself abandoned to decay,"
1674,ARGUMENT,And she forgotten in the quiet grave.                        510
1675,ARGUMENT,
1676,ARGUMENT,"""I speak,"" continued he, ""of One whose stock"
1677,ARGUMENT,Of virtues bloomed beneath this lowly roof.
1678,ARGUMENT,"She was a Woman of a steady mind,"
1679,ARGUMENT,Tender and deep in her excess of love;
1680,ARGUMENT,"Not speaking much, pleased rather with the joy               515"
1681,ARGUMENT,Of her own thoughts: by some especial care
1682,ARGUMENT,"Her temper had been framed, as if to make"
1683,ARGUMENT,"A Being, who by adding love to peace"
1684,ARGUMENT,Might live on earth a life of happiness.
1685,ARGUMENT,Her wedded Partner lacked not on his side                    520
1686,ARGUMENT,The humble worth that satisfied her heart:
1687,ARGUMENT,"Frugal, affectionate, sober, and withal"
1688,ARGUMENT,Keenly industrious. She with pride would tell
1689,ARGUMENT,"That he was often seated at his loom,[AW]"
1690,ARGUMENT,"In summer, ere the mower was abroad                          525"
1691,ARGUMENT,"Among the dewy grass,--in early spring,"
1692,ARGUMENT,Ere the last star had vanished.--They who passed
1693,ARGUMENT,"At evening, from behind the garden fence"
1694,ARGUMENT,"Might hear his busy spade, which he would ply,"
1695,ARGUMENT,"After his daily work, until the light                        530"
1696,ARGUMENT,"Had failed, and every leaf and flower were lost"
1697,ARGUMENT,In the dark hedges. So their days were spent
1698,ARGUMENT,In peace and comfort; and a pretty boy
1699,ARGUMENT,"Was their best hope, next to the God in heaven."
1700,ARGUMENT,
1701,ARGUMENT,"""Not twenty years ago, but you I think                     535"
1702,ARGUMENT,"Can scarcely bear it now in mind, there came"
1703,ARGUMENT,"Two blighting seasons, when the fields were left"
1704,ARGUMENT,With half a harvest. It pleased Heaven to add
1705,ARGUMENT,A worse affliction in the plague of war:
1706,ARGUMENT,This happy Land was stricken to the heart!                   540
1707,ARGUMENT,"A Wanderer then among the cottages,"
1708,ARGUMENT,"I, with my freight of winter raiment, saw"
1709,ARGUMENT,The hardships of that season: many rich
1710,ARGUMENT,"Sank down, as in a dream, among the poor;"
1711,ARGUMENT,"And of the poor did many cease to be,                        545"
1712,ARGUMENT,"And their place knew them not.[AX] Meanwhile, abridged"
1713,ARGUMENT,"Of daily comforts, gladly reconciled"
1714,ARGUMENT,"To numerous self-denials, Margaret"
1715,ARGUMENT,Went struggling on through those calamitous years
1716,ARGUMENT,"With cheerful hope, until the second autumn,                 550"
1717,ARGUMENT,"When her life's Helpmate on a sick-bed lay,[64]"
1718,ARGUMENT,Smitten with perilous fever. In disease
1719,ARGUMENT,"He lingered long; and, when his strength returned,"
1720,ARGUMENT,"He found the little he had stored, to meet"
1721,ARGUMENT,"The hour of accident or crippling age,                       555"
1722,ARGUMENT,Was all consumed. A second infant now
1723,ARGUMENT,Was added to the troubles of a time
1724,ARGUMENT,"Laden, for them and all of their degree,"
1725,ARGUMENT,With care and sorrow: shoals of artisans
1726,ARGUMENT,From ill-requited labour turned adrift                       560
1727,ARGUMENT,"Sought daily bread from public charity,[65]"
1728,ARGUMENT,"They, and their wives and children--happier far"
1729,ARGUMENT,Could they have lived as do the little birds
1730,ARGUMENT,"That peck along the hedge-rows, or the kite"
1731,ARGUMENT,That makes her dwelling on the mountain rocks![66]           565
1732,ARGUMENT,"""A sad reverse it was for him who long"
1733,ARGUMENT,"Had filled with plenty, and possessed in peace,"
1734,ARGUMENT,"This lonely Cottage. At the door[67] he stood,"
1735,ARGUMENT,And whistled many a snatch of merry tunes
1736,ARGUMENT,That had no mirth in them;[AY] or with his knife             570
1737,ARGUMENT,Carved uncouth figures on the heads of sticks--
1738,ARGUMENT,"Then, not less idly, sought, through every nook"
1739,ARGUMENT,"In house or garden, any casual work"
1740,ARGUMENT,"Of use or ornament; and with a strange,"
1741,ARGUMENT,"Amusing, yet uneasy, novelty,                                575"
1742,ARGUMENT,"He mingled,[68] where he might, the various tasks"
1743,ARGUMENT,"Of summer, autumn, winter, and of spring."
1744,ARGUMENT,But this endured not; his good humour soon
1745,ARGUMENT,Became a weight in which no pleasure was:
1746,ARGUMENT,And poverty brought on a petted mood                         580
1747,ARGUMENT,"And a sore temper: day by day he drooped,"
1748,ARGUMENT,And he would leave his work--and to the town
1749,ARGUMENT,Would turn without an errand his slack steps;[69]
1750,ARGUMENT,Or wander here and there among the fields.
1751,ARGUMENT,"One while he would speak lightly of his babes,               585"
1752,ARGUMENT,And with a cruel tongue; at other times
1753,ARGUMENT,He tossed them with a false unnatural joy:
1754,ARGUMENT,And 'twas a rueful thing to see the looks
1755,ARGUMENT,"Of the poor innocent children. 'Every smile,'"
1756,ARGUMENT,"Said Margaret to me, here beneath these trees,               590"
1757,ARGUMENT,"'Made my heart bleed.'"""
1758,ARGUMENT,At this the Wanderer paused;
1759,ARGUMENT,"And, looking up to those enormous elms,"
1760,ARGUMENT,"He said, ""'Tis now the hour of deepest noon.[AZ]"
1761,ARGUMENT,"At this still season of repose and peace,"
1762,ARGUMENT,This hour when all things which are not at rest              595
1763,ARGUMENT,Are cheerful; while this multitude of flies
1764,ARGUMENT,With tuneful hum is filling all the air;[70]
1765,ARGUMENT,Why should a tear be on an old Man's cheek?[71]
1766,ARGUMENT,"Why should we thus, with an untoward mind,"
1767,ARGUMENT,"And in the weakness of humanity,                             600"
1768,ARGUMENT,From natural wisdom turn our hearts away;
1769,ARGUMENT,To natural comfort shut our eyes and ears;
1770,ARGUMENT,"And, feeding on disquiet, thus disturb"
1771,ARGUMENT,"The calm of nature with our restless thoughts?"""
1772,ARGUMENT,
1773,ARGUMENT,*       *       *       *       *
1774,ARGUMENT,
1775,ARGUMENT,He spake with somewhat of a solemn tone:                     605
1776,ARGUMENT,"But, when he ended, there was in his face"
1777,ARGUMENT,"Such easy cheerfulness, a look so mild,[BA]"
1778,ARGUMENT,That for a little time it stole away
1779,ARGUMENT,All recollection; and that simple tale
1780,ARGUMENT,Passed from my mind like a forgotten sound.                  610
1781,ARGUMENT,"A while on trivial things we held discourse,"
1782,ARGUMENT,"To me soon tasteless. In my own despite,"
1783,ARGUMENT,I thought of that poor Woman as of one
1784,ARGUMENT,Whom I had known and loved. He had rehearsed
1785,ARGUMENT,"Her homely tale with such familiar power,                    615"
1786,ARGUMENT,"With such an active countenance, an eye"
1787,ARGUMENT,"So busy, that the things of which he spake"
1788,ARGUMENT,"Seemed present; and, attention now relaxed,"
1789,ARGUMENT,A heart-felt chillness crept along my veins.
1790,ARGUMENT,"I rose; and, having left the breezy shade,                   620"
1791,ARGUMENT,"Stood drinking comfort from the warmer sun,"
1792,ARGUMENT,"That had not cheered me long--ere, looking round[72]"
1793,ARGUMENT,"Upon that tranquil Ruin, I returned,"
1794,ARGUMENT,"And begged of the old Man that, for my sake,"
1795,ARGUMENT,He would resume his story.
1796,ARGUMENT,"He replied,                      625"
1797,ARGUMENT,"""It were a wantonness, and would demand"
1798,ARGUMENT,"Severe reproof, if we were men whose hearts"
1799,ARGUMENT,Could hold vain dalliance with the misery
1800,ARGUMENT,Even of the dead; contented thence to draw
1801,ARGUMENT,"A momentary pleasure, never marked                           630"
1802,ARGUMENT,"By reason, barren of all future good."
1803,ARGUMENT,But we have known that there is often found
1804,ARGUMENT,"In mournful thoughts, and always might be found,"
1805,ARGUMENT,"A power to virtue friendly; wer't not so,"
1806,ARGUMENT,"I am a dreamer among men, indeed                             635"
1807,ARGUMENT,"An idle dreamer! 'Tis a common tale,"
1808,ARGUMENT,"An ordinary sorrow of man's life,"
1809,ARGUMENT,"A tale of silent suffering, hardly clothed"
1810,ARGUMENT,In bodily form.--But without further bidding
1811,ARGUMENT,I will proceed.
1812,ARGUMENT,"""While thus it fared with them,              640"
1813,ARGUMENT,"To whom this cottage, till those hapless years,"
1814,ARGUMENT,"Had been a blessed home, it was my chance"
1815,ARGUMENT,To travel in a country far remote;
1816,ARGUMENT,And[73] when these lofty elms once more appeared
1817,ARGUMENT,What pleasant expectations lured me on                       645
1818,ARGUMENT,O'er the flat Common!--With quick step I reached
1819,ARGUMENT,"The threshold, lifted with light hand the latch;"
1820,ARGUMENT,"But, when I entered, Margaret looked at me[74]"
1821,ARGUMENT,A little while; then turned her head away
1822,ARGUMENT,"Speechless,--and, sitting down upon a chair,                 650"
1823,ARGUMENT,"Wept bitterly. I wist not what to do,"
1824,ARGUMENT,Nor[75] how to speak to her. Poor Wretch! at last
1825,ARGUMENT,"She rose from off her seat, and then,--O Sir!"
1826,ARGUMENT,I cannot _tell_ how she pronounced my name:--
1827,ARGUMENT,"With fervent love, and with a face of grief                  655"
1828,ARGUMENT,"Unutterably helpless, and a look"
1829,ARGUMENT,"That seemed to cling upon me,[76] she enquired"
1830,ARGUMENT,If I had seen her husband. As she spake
1831,ARGUMENT,"A strange surprise and fear came to my heart,"
1832,ARGUMENT,Nor had I power to answer ere she told                       660
1833,ARGUMENT,That he had disappeared--not two months gone.
1834,ARGUMENT,"He left his house: two wretched days had past,"
1835,ARGUMENT,"And on the third, as wistfully she raised"
1836,ARGUMENT,"Her head from off her pillow, to look forth,"
1837,ARGUMENT,"Like one in trouble, for returning light,                    665"
1838,ARGUMENT,Within her chamber-casement she espied
1839,ARGUMENT,"A folded paper, lying as if placed"
1840,ARGUMENT,To meet her waking eyes. This tremblingly
1841,ARGUMENT,"She opened--found no writing, but beheld[77]"
1842,ARGUMENT,"Pieces of money carefully enclosed,                          670"
1843,ARGUMENT,"Silver and gold. 'I shuddered at the sight,'"
1844,ARGUMENT,"Said Margaret, 'for I knew it was his hand"
1845,ARGUMENT,That must have placed it there; and ere that day
1846,ARGUMENT,"Was ended, that long anxious day, I learned,"
1847,ARGUMENT,From one who by my husband had been sent                     675
1848,ARGUMENT,"With the sad news, that he had joined a troop[78]"
1849,ARGUMENT,"Of soldiers, going to a distant land."
1850,ARGUMENT,--He left me thus--he could not gather heart
1851,ARGUMENT,To take a farewell of me; for he feared
1852,ARGUMENT,"That I should follow with my babes, and sink                 680"
1853,ARGUMENT,Beneath the misery of that wandering life.'
1854,ARGUMENT,
1855,ARGUMENT,"""This tale did Margaret tell with many tears:"
1856,ARGUMENT,"And, when she ended, I had little power"
1857,ARGUMENT,"To give her comfort, and was glad to take                    684"
1858,ARGUMENT,Such words of hope from her own mouth as served
1859,ARGUMENT,To cheer us both. But long we had not talked
1860,ARGUMENT,"Ere we built up a pile of better thoughts,"
1861,ARGUMENT,And with a brighter eye she looked around
1862,ARGUMENT,As if she had been shedding tears of joy.
1863,ARGUMENT,We parted.--'Twas the time of early spring;                  690
1864,ARGUMENT,I left her busy with her garden tools;
1865,ARGUMENT,"And well remember, o'er that fence she looked,"
1866,ARGUMENT,"And, while I paced along the foot-way path,"
1867,ARGUMENT,"Called out, and sent a blessing after me,"
1868,ARGUMENT,"With tender cheerfulness, and with a voice                   695"
1869,ARGUMENT,That seemed the very sound of happy thoughts.
1870,ARGUMENT,
1871,ARGUMENT,"""I roved o'er many a hill and many a dale,"
1872,ARGUMENT,"With my accustomed load; in heat and cold,"
1873,ARGUMENT,"Through many a wood and many an open ground,"
1874,ARGUMENT,"In sunshine and in shade, in wet and fair,                   700"
1875,ARGUMENT,"Drooping or blithe of heart, as might befal;"
1876,ARGUMENT,"My best companions now the driving winds,"
1877,ARGUMENT,"And now the 'trotting brooks'[BB] and whispering trees,"
1878,ARGUMENT,"And now the music of my own sad steps,"
1879,ARGUMENT,"With many a short-lived thought that passed between,"
1880,ARGUMENT,And disappeared.
1881,ARGUMENT,"""I journeyed back this way,               706"
1882,ARGUMENT,"When, in the warmth of midsummer, the wheat[79]"
1883,ARGUMENT,"Was yellow; and the soft and bladed grass,[BC]"
1884,ARGUMENT,"Springing afresh, had o'er the hay-field spread"
1885,ARGUMENT,"Its tender verdure. At the door arrived,                     710"
1886,ARGUMENT,"I found that she was absent. In the shade,"
1887,ARGUMENT,"Where now we sit, I waited her return."
1888,ARGUMENT,"Her cottage, then a cheerful object, wore"
1889,ARGUMENT,"Its customary look,--only, it seemed,[80]"
1890,ARGUMENT,"The honeysuckle, crowding round the porch,                   715"
1891,ARGUMENT,"Hung down in heavier tufts; and that bright weed,"
1892,ARGUMENT,"The yellow stone-crop,[BD] suffered to take root"
1893,ARGUMENT,"Along the window's edge, profusely grew"
1894,ARGUMENT,"Blinding the lower panes. I turned aside,"
1895,ARGUMENT,And strolled into her garden. It appeared                    720
1896,ARGUMENT,"To lag behind the season, and had lost"
1897,ARGUMENT,Its pride of neatness. Daisy-flowers and thrift[BE]
1898,ARGUMENT,"Had broken their trim border-lines, and straggled"
1899,ARGUMENT,"O'er paths they used to deck:[81] carnations, once"
1900,ARGUMENT,"Prized for surpassing beauty, and no less                    725"
1901,ARGUMENT,"For the peculiar pains they had required,"
1902,ARGUMENT,"Declined their languid heads, wanting support.[82]"
1903,ARGUMENT,"The cumbrous bind-weed,[BF] with its wreaths and bells,"
1904,ARGUMENT,"Had twined about her two small rows of peas,                 729"
1905,ARGUMENT,And dragged them to the earth.
1906,ARGUMENT,"""Ere this an hour"
1907,ARGUMENT,Was wasted.--Back I turned my restless steps;
1908,ARGUMENT,"[83]A stranger passed; and, guessing whom I sought,"
1909,ARGUMENT,He said that she was used to ramble far.--
1910,ARGUMENT,The sun was sinking in the west; and now
1911,ARGUMENT,I sate with sad impatience. From within                      735
1912,ARGUMENT,Her solitary infant cried aloud;
1913,ARGUMENT,"Then, like a blast that dies away self-stilled,"
1914,ARGUMENT,The voice was silent. From the bench I rose;
1915,ARGUMENT,But neither could divert nor soothe my thoughts.
1916,ARGUMENT,"The spot, though fair, was very desolate--                   740"
1917,ARGUMENT,"The longer I remained, more desolate:"
1918,ARGUMENT,"And, looking round me, now I first observed"
1919,ARGUMENT,"The corner stones, on either side the porch,[84]"
1920,ARGUMENT,"With dull red stains discoloured, and stuck o'er"
1921,ARGUMENT,"With tufts and hairs of wool, as if the sheep,               745"
1922,ARGUMENT,"That fed upon the Common, thither came"
1923,ARGUMENT,"Familiarly, and found a couching-place"
1924,ARGUMENT,Even at her threshold. Deeper shadows fell
1925,ARGUMENT,From these tall elms; the cottage-clock struck eight;--
1926,ARGUMENT,"I turned, and saw her distant a few steps.                   750"
1927,ARGUMENT,"Her face was pale and thin--her figure, too,"
1928,ARGUMENT,"Was changed. As she unlocked the door, she said,"
1929,ARGUMENT,"'It grieves me you have waited here so long,"
1930,ARGUMENT,"But, in good truth, I've wandered much of late;"
1931,ARGUMENT,"And, sometimes--to my shame I speak--have need"
1932,ARGUMENT,Of my best prayers to bring me back again.'                  756
1933,ARGUMENT,"While on the board she spread our evening meal,"
1934,ARGUMENT,She told me--interrupting not the work
1935,ARGUMENT,Which gave employment to her listless hands--
1936,ARGUMENT,That she had parted with her elder child;                    760
1937,ARGUMENT,To a kind master on a distant farm
1938,ARGUMENT,Now happily apprenticed.--'I perceive
1939,ARGUMENT,"You look at me, and you have cause; to-day"
1940,ARGUMENT,I have been travelling far; and many days
1941,ARGUMENT,"About the fields I wander, knowing this                      765"
1942,ARGUMENT,"Only, that what I seek I cannot find;"
1943,ARGUMENT,And so I waste my time: for I am changed;
1944,ARGUMENT,"And to myself,' said she, 'have done much wrong"
1945,ARGUMENT,And to this helpless infant. I have slept
1946,ARGUMENT,"Weeping, and weeping have I waked;[85] my tears              770"
1947,ARGUMENT,Have flowed as if my body were not such
1948,ARGUMENT,As others are; and I could never die.
1949,ARGUMENT,But I am now in mind and in my heart
1950,ARGUMENT,"More easy; and I hope,' said she, 'that God[86]"
1951,ARGUMENT,Will give me patience to endure the things                   775
1952,ARGUMENT,Which I behold at home.'
1953,ARGUMENT,"""It would have grieved"
1954,ARGUMENT,"Your very soul to see her. Sir, I feel"
1955,ARGUMENT,The story linger in my heart; I fear
1956,ARGUMENT,'Tis long and tedious; but my spirit clings
1957,ARGUMENT,To that poor Woman:--so familiarly                           780
1958,ARGUMENT,"Do I perceive her manner, and her look,"
1959,ARGUMENT,And presence; and so deeply do I feel
1960,ARGUMENT,"Her goodness, that, not seldom, in my walks"
1961,ARGUMENT,A momentary trance comes over me;
1962,ARGUMENT,And to myself I seem to muse on One                          785
1963,ARGUMENT,"By sorrow laid asleep; or borne away,"
1964,ARGUMENT,A human being destined to awake
1965,ARGUMENT,"To human life, or something very near"
1966,ARGUMENT,"To human life, when he shall come again"
1967,ARGUMENT,"For whom she suffered. Yes, it would have grieved            790"
1968,ARGUMENT,Your very soul to see her: evermore
1969,ARGUMENT,"Her eyelids drooped, her eyes downward were cast;[87]"
1970,ARGUMENT,"And, when she at her table gave me food,"
1971,ARGUMENT,"She did not look at me. Her voice was low,"
1972,ARGUMENT,Her body was subdued. In every act                           795
1973,ARGUMENT,"Pertaining to her house-affairs, appeared"
1974,ARGUMENT,The careless stillness of a thinking mind
1975,ARGUMENT,Self-occupied; to which all outward things
1976,ARGUMENT,"Are like an idle matter. Still she sighed,"
1977,ARGUMENT,"But yet no motion of the breast was seen,                    800"
1978,ARGUMENT,No heaving of the heart. While by the fire
1979,ARGUMENT,"We sate together, sighs came on my ear,"
1980,ARGUMENT,"I knew not how, and hardly whence they came."
1981,ARGUMENT,
1982,ARGUMENT,"""Ere my departure, to her care I gave,"
1983,ARGUMENT,"For her son's use, some tokens of regard,                    805"
1984,ARGUMENT,Which with a look of welcome she received;
1985,ARGUMENT,And I exhorted her to place her trust[88]
1986,ARGUMENT,"In God's good love, and seek his help by prayer."
1987,ARGUMENT,"I took my staff, and, when I kissed her babe,"
1988,ARGUMENT,The tears stood in her eyes. I left her then                 810
1989,ARGUMENT,With the best hope and comfort I could give:
1990,ARGUMENT,She thanked me for my wish;--but for my hope
1991,ARGUMENT,It seemed[89] she did not thank me.
1992,ARGUMENT,"""I returned,"
1993,ARGUMENT,And took my rounds along this road again
1994,ARGUMENT,When[90] on its sunny bank the primrose flower               815
1995,ARGUMENT,"Peeped forth, to give an earnest of the Spring."
1996,ARGUMENT,I found her sad and drooping: she had learned
1997,ARGUMENT,"No tidings of her husband; if he lived,[91]"
1998,ARGUMENT,"She knew not that he lived; if he were dead,                 819"
1999,ARGUMENT,She knew not he was dead. She seemed the same
2000,ARGUMENT,In person and appearance; but her house
2001,ARGUMENT,Bespake a sleepy hand of negligence;[BG]
2002,ARGUMENT,"The floor was neither dry nor neat, the hearth"
2003,ARGUMENT,"Was comfortless, and her small lot of books,"
2004,ARGUMENT,"Which, in the cottage-window, heretofore                     825"
2005,ARGUMENT,Had been piled up against the corner panes
2006,ARGUMENT,"In seemly order, now, with straggling leaves"
2007,ARGUMENT,"Lay scattered here and there, open or shut,"
2008,ARGUMENT,As they had chanced to fall. Her infant Babe
2009,ARGUMENT,"Had from its Mother caught the trick of grief,               830"
2010,ARGUMENT,"And sighed among its playthings. I withdrew,"
2011,ARGUMENT,"And once again entering the garden saw,[92]"
2012,ARGUMENT,"More plainly still, that poverty and grief"
2013,ARGUMENT,Were now come nearer to her: weeds defaced
2014,ARGUMENT,"The hardened soil, and knots of withered grass:              835"
2015,ARGUMENT,"No ridges there appeared of clear black mould,"
2016,ARGUMENT,"No winter greenness; of her herbs and flowers,"
2017,ARGUMENT,It seemed the better part were gnawed away
2018,ARGUMENT,"Or trampled into earth; a chain of straw,"
2019,ARGUMENT,Which had been twined about the slender stem                 840
2020,ARGUMENT,"Of a young apple-tree, lay at its root;"
2021,ARGUMENT,The bark was nibbled round by truant sheep.
2022,ARGUMENT,"--Margaret stood near, her infant in her arms,"
2023,ARGUMENT,"And, noting that my eye was on the tree,"
2024,ARGUMENT,"She said, 'I fear it will be dead and gone                   845"
2025,ARGUMENT,Ere Robert come again.' When to the House
2026,ARGUMENT,"We had returned together, she enquired[93]"
2027,ARGUMENT,If I had any hope:--but for her babe
2028,ARGUMENT,"And for her little orphan boy, she said,"
2029,ARGUMENT,"She had no wish to live, that she must die                   850"
2030,ARGUMENT,Of sorrow. Yet I saw the idle loom
2031,ARGUMENT,Still in its place; his sunday garments hung
2032,ARGUMENT,Upon the self-same nail; his very staff
2033,ARGUMENT,Stood undisturbed behind the door.
2034,ARGUMENT,"""And when,"
2035,ARGUMENT,"In bleak December, I retraced this way,                      855"
2036,ARGUMENT,"She told me that her little babe was dead,"
2037,ARGUMENT,"And she was left alone. She now, released"
2038,ARGUMENT,"From her maternal cares, had taken up"
2039,ARGUMENT,"The employment common through these wilds, and gained,"
2040,ARGUMENT,"By spinning hemp, a pittance for herself;                    860"
2041,ARGUMENT,And for this end had hired a neighbour's boy
2042,ARGUMENT,To give her needful help. That very time
2043,ARGUMENT,"Most willingly she put her work aside,"
2044,ARGUMENT,"And walked with me along the miry road,"
2045,ARGUMENT,"Heedless how far; and, in such piteous sort                  865"
2046,ARGUMENT,"That any heart had ached to hear her, begged"
2047,ARGUMENT,"That, wheresoe'er I went, I still would ask"
2048,ARGUMENT,For him whom she had lost. We parted then--
2049,ARGUMENT,Our final parting; for from that time forth
2050,ARGUMENT,Did many seasons pass ere I returned                         870
2051,ARGUMENT,Into this tract again.
2052,ARGUMENT,"""Nine tedious years;"
2053,ARGUMENT,"From their first separation, nine long years,"
2054,ARGUMENT,She lingered in unquiet widowhood;
2055,ARGUMENT,A Wife and Widow. Needs must it have been
2056,ARGUMENT,"A sore heart-wasting! I have heard, my Friend,               875"
2057,ARGUMENT,That in yon arbour oftentimes she sate
2058,ARGUMENT,"Alone, through half the vacant sabbath day;"
2059,ARGUMENT,"And, if a dog passed by, she still would quit"
2060,ARGUMENT,"The shade, and look abroad. On this old bench"
2061,ARGUMENT,For hours she sate; and evermore her eye                     880
2062,ARGUMENT,"Was busy in the distance, shaping things"
2063,ARGUMENT,"That made her heart beat quick. You see that path,"
2064,ARGUMENT,"Now faint,--the grass has crept o'er its grey line;"
2065,ARGUMENT,"There, to and fro, she paced through many a day"
2066,ARGUMENT,"Of the warm summer, from a belt of hemp                      885"
2067,ARGUMENT,"That girt her waist, spinning the long-drawn thread"
2068,ARGUMENT,With backward steps. Yet ever as there passed
2069,ARGUMENT,"A man whose garments showed the soldier's red,"
2070,ARGUMENT,"Or crippled mendicant in sailor's garb,"
2071,ARGUMENT,The little child who sate to turn the wheel                  890
2072,ARGUMENT,Ceased from his task; and she with faltering voice
2073,ARGUMENT,"Made many a fond enquiry; and when they,"
2074,ARGUMENT,"Whose presence gave no comfort, were gone by,"
2075,ARGUMENT,"Her heart was still more sad. And by yon gate,"
2076,ARGUMENT,"That bars the traveller's road, she often stood,             895"
2077,ARGUMENT,"And when a stranger horseman came, the latch"
2078,ARGUMENT,"Would lift, and in his face look wistfully:"
2079,ARGUMENT,"Most happy, if, from aught discovered there"
2080,ARGUMENT,"Of tender feeling, she might dare repeat"
2081,ARGUMENT,The same sad question. Meanwhile her poor Hut                900
2082,ARGUMENT,"Sank to decay; for he was gone, whose hand,"
2083,ARGUMENT,"At the first nipping of October frost,"
2084,ARGUMENT,"Closed up each chink, and with fresh bands of straw"
2085,ARGUMENT,Chequered the green-grown thatch. And so she lived
2086,ARGUMENT,"Through the long winter, reckless and alone;                 905"
2087,ARGUMENT,"Until her house by frost, and thaw, and rain,"
2088,ARGUMENT,"Was sapped; and while she slept, the nightly damps"
2089,ARGUMENT,Did chill her breast; and in the stormy day
2090,ARGUMENT,"Her tattered clothes were ruffled by the wind,"
2091,ARGUMENT,Even at the side of her own fire. Yet still                  910
2092,ARGUMENT,"She loved this wretched spot, nor would for worlds"
2093,ARGUMENT,"Have parted hence; and still that length of road,"
2094,ARGUMENT,"And this rude bench, one torturing hope endeared,"
2095,ARGUMENT,"Fast rooted at her heart: and here, my Friend,--"
2096,ARGUMENT,In sickness she remained; and here she died;                 915
2097,ARGUMENT,"Last human tenant of these ruined walls!""[BH]"
2098,ARGUMENT,
2099,ARGUMENT,The old Man ceased: he saw that I was moved;
2100,ARGUMENT,"From that low bench, rising instinctively"
2101,ARGUMENT,"I turned aside in weakness, nor had power"
2102,ARGUMENT,To thank him for the tale which he had told.                 920
2103,ARGUMENT,"I stood, and leaning o'er the garden wall"
2104,ARGUMENT,Reviewed that Woman's sufferings; and it seemed
2105,ARGUMENT,To comfort me while with a brother's love
2106,ARGUMENT,I blessed her in the impotence of grief.
2107,ARGUMENT,Then towards the cottage I returned; and traced              925
2108,ARGUMENT,"Fondly, though with an interest more mild,[94]"
2109,ARGUMENT,That secret spirit of humanity
2110,ARGUMENT,"Which, 'mid the calm oblivious tendencies"
2111,ARGUMENT,"Of nature, 'mid her plants, and weeds, and flowers,"
2112,ARGUMENT,"And silent overgrowings, still survived.                     930"
2113,ARGUMENT,"The old Man, noting this, resumed, and said,"
2114,ARGUMENT,"""My Friend! enough to sorrow you have given,"
2115,ARGUMENT,The purposes of wisdom ask no more:
2116,ARGUMENT,Nor more would she have craved as due to One
2117,ARGUMENT,"Who, in her worst distress, had oft-times felt               935"
2118,ARGUMENT,"The unbounded might of prayer; and learned, with soul"
2119,ARGUMENT,"Fixed on the Cross, that consolation springs,"
2120,ARGUMENT,"From sources deeper far than deepest pain,"
2121,ARGUMENT,For the meek Sufferer.[95] Why then should we read
2122,ARGUMENT,The forms of things with an unworthy eye?[96]                940
2123,ARGUMENT,"She sleeps in the calm earth, and peace is here."
2124,ARGUMENT,"I well remember that those very plumes,"
2125,ARGUMENT,"Those weeds, and the high spear-grass on that wall,"
2126,ARGUMENT,"By mist and silent rain-drops silvered o'er,"
2127,ARGUMENT,"As once I passed, into my heart conveyed[97]                 945"
2128,ARGUMENT,"So still an image of tranquillity,[BI]"
2129,ARGUMENT,"So calm and still, and looked so beautiful"
2130,ARGUMENT,"Amid the uneasy thoughts which filled my mind,"
2131,ARGUMENT,That what we feel of sorrow and despair
2132,ARGUMENT,"From ruin and from change, and all the grief                 950"
2133,ARGUMENT,"That passing shows[98] of Being leave behind,"
2134,ARGUMENT,"Appeared an idle dream, that could maintain,"
2135,ARGUMENT,"Nowhere, dominion o'er the enlightened spirit"
2136,ARGUMENT,Whose meditative sympathies repose
2137,ARGUMENT,"Upon the breast of Faith. I turned away,[99]                 955"
2138,ARGUMENT,"And walked along my road in happiness."""
2139,ARGUMENT,
2140,ARGUMENT,He ceased. Ere long the sun declining shot
2141,ARGUMENT,"A slant and mellow radiance, which began"
2142,ARGUMENT,"To fall upon us, while, beneath the trees,"
2143,ARGUMENT,"We sate on that low bench: and now we felt,                  960"
2144,ARGUMENT,"Admonished thus, the sweet hour coming on."
2145,ARGUMENT,"A linnet warbled from those lofty elms,"
2146,ARGUMENT,"A thrush sang loud, and other melodies,"
2147,ARGUMENT,"At distance heard, peopled the milder air."
2148,ARGUMENT,"The old Man rose, and, with a sprightly mien                 965"
2149,ARGUMENT,"Of hopeful preparation, grasped his staff;"
2150,ARGUMENT,Together casting then a farewell look
2151,ARGUMENT,"Upon those silent walls, we left the shade;"
2152,ARGUMENT,"And, ere the stars were visible, had reached"
2153,ARGUMENT,"A village-inn,--our evening resting-place.                   970"

3333,ARGUMENT,A length of journey yet remains untraced:
3334,ARGUMENT,"Let us proceed.""[123] Then, pointing with his staff"
3335,ARGUMENT,"Raised toward those craggy summits,[124] his intent"
3336,ARGUMENT,He thus imparted:--
3337,ARGUMENT,"""In a spot that lies                      155"
3338,ARGUMENT,"Among yon mountain fastnesses concealed,[BM]"
3339,ARGUMENT,"You will receive, before the hour of noon,"
3340,ARGUMENT,"Good recompense, I hope, for this day's toil,"
3341,ARGUMENT,"From sight of One who lives secluded there,"
3342,ARGUMENT,"Lonesome and lost: of whom, and whose past life,             160"
3343,ARGUMENT,(Not to forestall such knowledge as may be
3344,ARGUMENT,More faithfully collected from himself)
3345,ARGUMENT,This brief communication shall suffice.
3346,ARGUMENT,
3347,ARGUMENT,"""Though now sojourning there, he, like myself,"
3348,ARGUMENT,Sprang from a stock of lowly parentage                       165
3349,ARGUMENT,"Among the wilds of Scotland, in a tract"
3350,ARGUMENT,"Where many a sheltered and well-tended plant,"
3351,ARGUMENT,"Bears, on the humblest ground of social life,"
3352,ARGUMENT,Blossoms of piety and innocence.[125]
3353,ARGUMENT,Such grateful promises his youth displayed:                  170
3354,ARGUMENT,"And, having shown in study forward zeal,"
3355,ARGUMENT,He to the Ministry was duly called;
3356,ARGUMENT,"And straight, incited by a curious mind"
3357,ARGUMENT,"Filled with vague hopes, he undertook the charge[126]"
3358,ARGUMENT,Of Chaplain to a military troop[BN]                          175
3359,ARGUMENT,"Cheered by the Highland bagpipe, as they marched"
3360,ARGUMENT,"In plaided vest,--his fellow-countrymen."
3361,ARGUMENT,"This office filling, yet[127] by native power"
3362,ARGUMENT,And force of native inclination made
3363,ARGUMENT,An intellectual ruler in the haunts                          180
3364,ARGUMENT,"Of social vanity, he walked the world,"
3365,ARGUMENT,"Gay, and affecting graceful gaiety;"
3366,ARGUMENT,"Lax, buoyant--less a pastor with his flock"
3367,ARGUMENT,Than a soldier among soldiers--lived and roamed              184
3368,ARGUMENT,"Where Fortune led:--and Fortune, who oft proves"
3369,ARGUMENT,"The careless wanderer's friend, to him made known"
3370,ARGUMENT,"A blooming Lady--a conspicuous flower,"
3371,ARGUMENT,"Admired for beauty, for her sweetness praised;"
3372,ARGUMENT,"Whom he had sensibility to love,"
3373,ARGUMENT,"Ambition to attempt, and skill to win.                       190"
3374,ARGUMENT,
3375,ARGUMENT,"""For this fair Bride, most rich in gifts of mind,"
3376,ARGUMENT,"Nor sparingly endowed with worldly wealth,"
3377,ARGUMENT,His office he relinquished; and retired
3378,ARGUMENT,From the world's notice to a rural home.
3379,ARGUMENT,"Youth's season yet with him was scarcely past,               195"
3380,ARGUMENT,"And she was in youth's prime. How free their love,"
3381,ARGUMENT,"How full their joy! 'Till, pitiable doom![128]"
3382,ARGUMENT,"In the short course of one undreaded year,"
3383,ARGUMENT,Death blasted all. Death suddenly o'erthrew
3384,ARGUMENT,Two lovely Children--all that they possessed!                200
3385,ARGUMENT,The Mother followed:--miserably bare
3386,ARGUMENT,"The one Survivor stood; he wept, he prayed"
3387,ARGUMENT,"For his dismissal, day and night, compelled"
3388,ARGUMENT,"To hold communion with the grave, and face"
3389,ARGUMENT,With pain the regions of eternity.[129]                      205
3390,ARGUMENT,An uncomplaining apathy displaced
3391,ARGUMENT,"This anguish; and, indifferent to delight,"
3392,ARGUMENT,"To aim and purpose, he consumed his days,"
3393,ARGUMENT,"To private interest dead, and public care."
3394,ARGUMENT,So lived he; so he might have died.
3395,ARGUMENT,"""But now,               210"
3396,ARGUMENT,"To the wide world's astonishment, appeared"
3397,ARGUMENT,"A[130] glorious opening, the unlooked-for dawn,"
3398,ARGUMENT,That promised everlasting joy to France![BO]
3399,ARGUMENT,Her voice of social transport[131] reached even him!
3400,ARGUMENT,"He broke from his contracted bounds, repaired                215"
3401,ARGUMENT,"To the great City, an emporium then"
3402,ARGUMENT,"Of golden expectations, and receiving"
3403,ARGUMENT,Freights every day from a new world of hope.
3404,ARGUMENT,Thither his popular talents he transferred;
3405,ARGUMENT,"And, from the pulpit, zealously maintained                   220"
3406,ARGUMENT,"The cause of Christ and civil liberty,"
3407,ARGUMENT,"As one, and moving to one glorious end."
3408,ARGUMENT,Intoxicating service! I might say
3409,ARGUMENT,A happy service; for he was sincere
3410,ARGUMENT,"As vanity and fondness for applause,                         225"
3411,ARGUMENT,"And new and shapeless wishes, would allow."

3416,ARGUMENT,Was served by rival advocates that came                      230
3417,ARGUMENT,From regions opposite as heaven and hell.
3418,ARGUMENT,One courage seemed to animate them all:
3419,ARGUMENT,"And, from the dazzling conquests daily gained"
3420,ARGUMENT,"By their united efforts, there arose"
3421,ARGUMENT,A proud and most presumptuous confidence                     235
3422,ARGUMENT,"In the transcendent wisdom of the age,"
3423,ARGUMENT,"And her[133] discernment; not alone in rights,"
3424,ARGUMENT,And in the origin and bounds of power
3425,ARGUMENT,"Social and temporal; but in laws divine,"
3426,ARGUMENT,"Deduced by reason, or to faith revealed.                     240"
3427,ARGUMENT,An overweening trust was raised; and fear
3428,ARGUMENT,"Cast out, alike of person and of thing."
3429,ARGUMENT,"Plague from this union spread, whose subtle bane"
3430,ARGUMENT,The strongest did not easily escape;
3431,ARGUMENT,"And He, what wonder! took a mortal taint.                    245"
3432,ARGUMENT,"How shall I trace the change, how bear to tell"
3433,ARGUMENT,That he broke faith with them[134] whom he had laid
3434,ARGUMENT,"In earth's dark chambers, with a Christian's hope!"
3435,ARGUMENT,An infidel contempt of holy writ
3436,ARGUMENT,Stole by degrees upon his mind; and hence                    250
3437,ARGUMENT,"Life, like that Roman Janus, double-faced;"
3438,ARGUMENT,"Vilest hypocrisy--the laughing, gay"
3439,ARGUMENT,"Hypocrisy, not leagued with fear, but pride."
3440,ARGUMENT,Smooth words he had to wheedle simple souls;

3446,ARGUMENT,"That,[135] in the light of false philosophy,                 260"
3447,ARGUMENT,"Spread like a halo round a misty moon,"
3448,ARGUMENT,Widening its circle as the storms advance.

3454,ARGUMENT,I do not wish to wrong him; though the course
3455,ARGUMENT,Of private life licentiously displayed
3456,ARGUMENT,Unhallowed actions--planted like a crown
3457,ARGUMENT,Upon the insolent aspiring brow                              270
3458,ARGUMENT,Of spurious notions--worn as open signs
3459,ARGUMENT,"Of prejudice subdued--still he[136] retained,"
3460,ARGUMENT,"'Mid much[137] abasement, what he had received"

3463,ARGUMENT,"And mortal sickness on her face appeared,"
3464,ARGUMENT,He coloured objects to his own desire
3465,ARGUMENT,As with a lover's passion. Yet his moods
3466,ARGUMENT,"Of pain were keen as those of better men,"
3467,ARGUMENT,"Nay keener, as his fortitude was less:                       280"
3468,ARGUMENT,"And he continued, when worse days were come,"
3469,ARGUMENT,"To deal about his sparkling eloquence,"
3470,ARGUMENT,Struggling against the strange reverse with zeal
3471,ARGUMENT,"That showed like happiness. But, in despite"
3472,ARGUMENT,"Of all this outside bravery, within,                         285"
3473,ARGUMENT,He neither felt encouragement nor hope:
3474,ARGUMENT,"For moral dignity, and strength of mind,"

3476,ARGUMENT,"And reverence for himself; and, last and best,"
3477,ARGUMENT,"Confiding thoughts, through[138] love and fear of Him"
3478,ARGUMENT,Before whose sight the troubles of this world                291

3484,ARGUMENT,"From his own sight--this gone, he forfeited[139]"
3485,ARGUMENT,"All joy in human nature; was consumed,"
3486,ARGUMENT,"And vexed, and chafed, by levity and scorn,"

3507,ARGUMENT,"The way, while we advanced up that wide vale.[BQ]"
3508,ARGUMENT,Diverging now (as if his quest had been[143]
3509,ARGUMENT,"Some secret of the mountains, cavern, fall                   320"
3510,ARGUMENT,"Of water, or some lofty eminence,[144]"
3511,ARGUMENT,Renowned for splendid prospect far and wide)
3512,ARGUMENT,"We scaled, without a track to ease our steps,"
3513,ARGUMENT,"A steep ascent;[BR] and reached a dreary plain,[145][BS]"
3514,ARGUMENT,With a tumultuous waste of huge hill tops                    325
3515,ARGUMENT,Before us;[BT] savage region! which I paced

3520,ARGUMENT,Had been from eldest time by wish of theirs
3521,ARGUMENT,"So placed, to be shut out from all the world!"
3522,ARGUMENT,"Urn-like it was in shape, deep as an urn;[BU]"
3523,ARGUMENT,"With rocks encompassed, save that to the south               334"
3524,ARGUMENT,"Was one small opening,[BV] where a heath-clad ridge"
3525,ARGUMENT,Supplied a boundary less abrupt and close;
3526,ARGUMENT,"A quiet treeless nook, with two green fields,[BW]"
3527,ARGUMENT,"A liquid pool that glittered in the sun,[BX]"
3528,ARGUMENT,"And one bare dwelling; one abode, no more![BY]"
3529,ARGUMENT,"It seemed the home of poverty and toil,                      340"
3530,ARGUMENT,"Though not of want: the little fields, made green"
3531,ARGUMENT,"By husbandry of many thrifty years,"
3532,ARGUMENT,Paid cheerful tribute to the moorland house.
3533,ARGUMENT,"--There crows the cock, single in his domain:"
3534,ARGUMENT,The small birds find in spring no thicket there              345

3537,ARGUMENT,Shouteth faint tidings of some gladder place.
3538,ARGUMENT,
3539,ARGUMENT,"Ah! what a sweet Recess, thought I, is here!"
3540,ARGUMENT,Instantly throwing down my limbs at ease                     350
3541,ARGUMENT,Upon a bed of heath;--full many a spot
3542,ARGUMENT,Of hidden beauty have I chanced to espy
3543,ARGUMENT,Among the mountains; never one like this;
3544,ARGUMENT,"So lonesome, and so perfectly secure;"
3545,ARGUMENT,"Not melancholy--no, for it is green,                         355"
3546,ARGUMENT,"And bright, and fertile, furnished in itself"
3547,ARGUMENT,With the few needful things that[147] life requires.
3548,ARGUMENT,"--In rugged arms how softly does it lie,[148]"
3549,ARGUMENT,How tenderly protected! Far and near
3550,ARGUMENT,"We have an image of the pristine earth,                      360"
3551,ARGUMENT,The planet in its nakedness: were this
3552,ARGUMENT,"Man's only dwelling, sole appointed seat,"
3553,ARGUMENT,"First, last, and single, in the breathing world,"
3554,ARGUMENT,It could not be more quiet: peace is here
3555,ARGUMENT,Or nowhere; days unruffled by the gale                       365
3556,ARGUMENT,Of public news or private; years that pass
3557,ARGUMENT,Forgetfully; uncalled upon to pay
3558,ARGUMENT,"The common penalties of mortal life,"
3559,ARGUMENT,"Sickness, or accident, or grief, or pain."

3564,ARGUMENT,"Of that profound abyss a solemn voice,"
3565,ARGUMENT,"Or several voices in one solemn sound,"
3566,ARGUMENT,"Was heard ascending; mournful, deep, and slow                375"
3567,ARGUMENT,"The cadence, as of psalms--a funeral dirge![BZ]"
3568,ARGUMENT,"We listened, looking down upon the hut,[150]"
3569,ARGUMENT,But seeing no one: meanwhile from below
3570,ARGUMENT,"The strain continued, spiritual as before;"
3571,ARGUMENT,And now distinctly could I recognise                         380
3572,ARGUMENT,"These words:--'_Shall in the grave thy love be known,_"
3573,ARGUMENT,"_In death thy faithfulness?_'--""God rest his soul!""[151]"
3574,ARGUMENT,"Said the old man,[152] abruptly breaking silence,--"
3575,ARGUMENT,"""He is departed, and finds peace at last!"""
3576,ARGUMENT,"This scarcely spoken, and those holy strains               385"
3577,ARGUMENT,"Not ceasing, forth appeared in view a band"

3586,ARGUMENT,"Recovering, to my Friend I said, ""You spake,                 395"

3603,ARGUMENT,An object that enticed my steps aside!
3604,ARGUMENT,"A narrow, winding, entry opened out[156]"
3605,ARGUMENT,"Into a platform--that lay, sheepfold-wise,"

3607,ARGUMENT,"And one old moss-grown wall;--a cool recess,                 415"
3608,ARGUMENT,And fanciful! For where the rock and wall
3609,ARGUMENT,"Met in an angle, hung a penthouse, framed"
3610,ARGUMENT,By thrusting two rude staves into the wall[158]
3611,ARGUMENT,And overlaying them with mountain sods;

3691,ARGUMENT,"Into the rough uncultivated ground,[CG]"
3692,ARGUMENT,Behold the Man whom he had fancied dead!
3693,ARGUMENT,"I knew from his deportment, mien, and dress,[166]"
3694,ARGUMENT,"That it could be no other; a pale face,"
3695,ARGUMENT,"A meagre person, tall, and in a garb[167]                    500"
3696,ARGUMENT,Not rustic--dull and faded like himself!

3701,ARGUMENT,"With intermixture of endearing words,"
3702,ARGUMENT,"To soothe a Child, who walked beside him, weeping"

3712,ARGUMENT,He was all fire: no shadow on his brow
3713,ARGUMENT,"Remained, nor sign of sickness on his face.[170]"
3714,ARGUMENT,"Hands joined he with his Visitant,--a grasp,"
3715,ARGUMENT,An eager grasp; and many moments' space--
3716,ARGUMENT,"When the first glow of pleasure was no more,                 520"
3717,ARGUMENT,"And, of the sad appearance which at once"

3836,ARGUMENT,"Quickly had he spoken,"
3837,ARGUMENT,"And, with light steps still quicker than his words,"
3838,ARGUMENT,Led toward the Cottage. Homely was the spot;[179]
3839,ARGUMENT,"And, to my feeling, ere we reached the door,"
3840,ARGUMENT,Had almost a forbidding nakedness;                           640
3841,ARGUMENT,"Less fair, I grant, even painfully less fair,"
3842,ARGUMENT,Than it appeared when from the beetling rock[180]
3843,ARGUMENT,"We had looked down upon it. All within,"
3844,ARGUMENT,"As left by the[181] departed company,"
3845,ARGUMENT,Was silent; save the solitary clock                          645

3847,ARGUMENT,"Following our Guide, we clomb the cottage-stairs"

3857,ARGUMENT,He went about his hospitable task.
3858,ARGUMENT,"My eyes were busy, and my thoughts no less,"
3859,ARGUMENT,"And pleased I looked upon my grey-haired Friend,"
3860,ARGUMENT,"As if to thank him; he returned that look,"
3861,ARGUMENT,"Cheered, plainly, and yet serious. What a wreck              660"
3862,ARGUMENT,"Had we about us![183] scattered was the floor,"
3863,ARGUMENT,"And, in like sort, chair, window-seat, and shelf,"
3864,ARGUMENT,"With books, maps, fossils, withered plants and flowers,"
3865,ARGUMENT,And tufts of mountain moss. Mechanic tools
3866,ARGUMENT,"Lay intermixed with scraps of paper, some[184]               665"
3867,ARGUMENT,Scribbled with verse: a broken angling-rod
3868,ARGUMENT,"And shattered telescope, together linked"
3869,ARGUMENT,"By cobwebs, stood within a dusty nook;"
3870,ARGUMENT,"And instruments of music, some half-made,"
3871,ARGUMENT,"Some in disgrace, hung dangling from the walls.              670"
3872,ARGUMENT,But speedily the promise was fulfilled;
3873,ARGUMENT,"A feast before us, and a[185] courteous Host"
3874,ARGUMENT,Inviting us in glee to sit and eat.
3875,ARGUMENT,"A napkin, white as foam of that rough brook"
3876,ARGUMENT,"By which it had been bleached, o'erspread the board;"
3877,ARGUMENT,And was itself half-covered with a store[186]                676
3878,ARGUMENT,"Of dainties,--oaten bread, curd,[187] cheese, and cream;"
3879,ARGUMENT,"And cakes of butter curiously embossed,"
3880,ARGUMENT,Butter that had imbibed from meadow-flowers
3881,ARGUMENT,"A golden hue, delicate as their own                          680"
3882,ARGUMENT,"Faintly reflected in a lingering stream.""[188]"
3883,ARGUMENT,"Nor lacked, for more delight on that warm day,"
3884,ARGUMENT,"Our table small parade of garden fruits,"
3885,ARGUMENT,And whortle-berries from the mountain side.
3886,ARGUMENT,"The Child, who long ere this had stilled his sobs,           685"
3887,ARGUMENT,"Was now[189] a help to his late comforter,"
3888,ARGUMENT,"And moved, a willing Page, as he was bid,"
3889,ARGUMENT,Ministering to our need.
3890,ARGUMENT,"In genial mood,"
3891,ARGUMENT,While at our pastoral banquet thus we sate
3892,ARGUMENT,"Fronting the window of that little cell,                     690"
3893,ARGUMENT,"I could not, ever and anon, forbear"

3896,ARGUMENT,"""Those lusty twins,"" exclaimed our host, ""if here"

3898,ARGUMENT,Your prized companions.--Many are the notes
3899,ARGUMENT,"Which, in his tuneful course, the wind draws forth"
3900,ARGUMENT,"From rocks, woods, caverns, heaths, and dashing shores;"
3901,ARGUMENT,And well those lofty brethren bear their part
3902,ARGUMENT,In the wild concert--chiefly when the storm                  700
3903,ARGUMENT,Rides high; then all the upper air they fill
3904,ARGUMENT,"With roaring sound, that ceases not to flow,"
3905,ARGUMENT,"Like smoke, along the level of the blast,"
3906,ARGUMENT,"In mighty current; theirs, too, is the song"
3907,ARGUMENT,Of stream and headlong flood that seldom fails;              705
3908,ARGUMENT,"And, in the grim and breathless hour of noon,"
3909,ARGUMENT,Methinks that I have heard them echo back
3910,ARGUMENT,The thunder's greeting. Nor have nature's laws

3913,ARGUMENT,"So do I call it, though it be the hand"
3914,ARGUMENT,"Of silence, though there be no voice;--the clouds,"
3915,ARGUMENT,"The mist, the shadows, light of golden suns,"
3916,ARGUMENT,"Motions of moonlight, all come thither--touch,"
3917,ARGUMENT,"And have an answer--thither come, and shape                  715"
3918,ARGUMENT,A language not unwelcome to sick hearts
3919,ARGUMENT,"And idle spirits:--there the sun himself,"
3920,ARGUMENT,"At the calm close of summer's longest day,[CM]"
3921,ARGUMENT,Rests his substantial orb;--between those heights
3922,ARGUMENT,"And on the top of either pinnacle,                           720"
3923,ARGUMENT,"More keenly than elsewhere in night's blue vault,"
3924,ARGUMENT,"Sparkle the stars, as of their station proud."
3925,ARGUMENT,Thoughts are not busier in the mind of man
3926,ARGUMENT,Than the mute agents stirring there:--alone
3927,ARGUMENT,"Here do I sit and watch.""--[CN]"
3928,ARGUMENT,"A fall of voice,                   725"
3929,ARGUMENT,"Regretted like the nightingale's last note,"
3930,ARGUMENT,Had scarcely closed this high-wrought strain of rapture
3931,ARGUMENT,Ere with inviting smile the Wanderer said:[192]
3932,ARGUMENT,"""Now for the tale with which you threatened us!"""
3933,ARGUMENT,"""In truth the threat escaped me unawares:                    730"

3938,ARGUMENT,"Islanders mid[194] a stormy mountain sea,                    735"
3939,ARGUMENT,We are not so;--perpetually we touch
3940,ARGUMENT,Upon the vulgar ordinances[195] of the world;
3941,ARGUMENT,"And he, whom this our cottage hath to-day"
3942,ARGUMENT,"Relinquished, lived[196] dependent for his bread"
3943,ARGUMENT,Upon the laws of public charity.                             740
3944,ARGUMENT,"The Housewife, tempted by such slender gains"
3945,ARGUMENT,"As might from that occasion be distilled,"
3946,ARGUMENT,"Opened, as she before had done for me,"
3947,ARGUMENT,Her doors to admit this homeless Pensioner;
3948,ARGUMENT,The portion gave of coarse but wholesome fare                745
3949,ARGUMENT,"Which appetite required--a blind dull nook,"
3950,ARGUMENT,"Such as she had, the _kennel_ of his rest!"
3951,ARGUMENT,"This, in itself not ill, would yet have been"
3952,ARGUMENT,Ill borne in earlier life; but his was now
3953,ARGUMENT,The still contentedness of seventy years.                    750
3954,ARGUMENT,Calm did he sit under[197] the wide-spread tree
3955,ARGUMENT,"Of his old age: and yet less calm and meek,"
3956,ARGUMENT,"Winningly meek or venerably calm,"
3957,ARGUMENT,Than slow and torpid; paying in this wise
3958,ARGUMENT,"A penalty, if penalty it were,                               755"
3959,ARGUMENT,"For spendthrift feats, excesses of his prime."
3960,ARGUMENT,"I loved the old Man, for I pitied him!"
3961,ARGUMENT,"A task it was, I own, to hold discourse"
3962,ARGUMENT,"With one so slow in gathering up his thoughts,"
3963,ARGUMENT,But he was a cheap pleasure to my eyes;                      760
3964,ARGUMENT,"Mild, inoffensive, ready in _his_ way,"
3965,ARGUMENT,And helpful[198] to his utmost power: and there
3966,ARGUMENT,Our housewife knew full well what she possessed
3967,ARGUMENT,"He was her vassal of all labour, tilled"
3968,ARGUMENT,"Her garden, from the pasture fetched her kine;               765"
3969,ARGUMENT,"And, one among the orderly array"
3970,ARGUMENT,"Of hay-makers, beneath the burning sun"
3971,ARGUMENT,Maintained his place; or heedfully pursued
3972,ARGUMENT,"His course, on errands bound, to other vales,"
3973,ARGUMENT,Leading sometimes an inexperienced child                     770
3974,ARGUMENT,Too young for any profitable task.
3975,ARGUMENT,So moved he like a shadow that performed
3976,ARGUMENT,"Substantial service.[CO] Mark me now, and learn"
3977,ARGUMENT,For what reward!--The moon her monthly round
3978,ARGUMENT,"Hath not completed since our dame, the queen                 775"
3979,ARGUMENT,"Of this one cottage and this lonely dale,"
3980,ARGUMENT,Into my little sanctuary rushed--
3981,ARGUMENT,"Voice to a rueful treble humanised,"
3982,ARGUMENT,And features in deplorable dismay.
3983,ARGUMENT,"I treat the matter lightly, but, alas!                       780"
3984,ARGUMENT,It is most serious: persevering rain[199]
3985,ARGUMENT,Had fallen in torrents; all the mountain tops
3986,ARGUMENT,"Were hidden, and black vapours coursed their sides;"
3987,ARGUMENT,"This had I seen, and saw; but, till she spake,"
3988,ARGUMENT,Was wholly ignorant that my ancient Friend--                 785
3989,ARGUMENT,"Who at her bidding, early and alone,"

3999,ARGUMENT,"Which the neglected veteran had dropped,"
4000,ARGUMENT,But through all quarters looked for him in vain.
4001,ARGUMENT,We shouted--but no answer! Darkness fell
4002,ARGUMENT,"Without remission of the blast or shower,"

4015,ARGUMENT,"'Till, chancing on that[203] lofty ridge to pass"
4016,ARGUMENT,A heap of ruin--almost without walls
4017,ARGUMENT,And wholly without roof (the bleached remains

4019,ARGUMENT,The peasants of these lonely valleys used                    815
4020,ARGUMENT,To meet for worship on that central height)--
4021,ARGUMENT,"We there espied the object of our search,[204]"
4022,ARGUMENT,Lying full three parts buried among tufts
4023,ARGUMENT,"Of heath-plant, under and above him strewn,"
4024,ARGUMENT,"To baffle, as he might, the watery storm:                    820"
4025,ARGUMENT,"And there we found him breathing peaceably,"
4026,ARGUMENT,Snug as a child that hides itself in sport
4027,ARGUMENT,'Mid a green hay-cock in a sunny field.
4028,ARGUMENT,"We spake--he made reply, but would not stir"

4034,ARGUMENT,"A single step, that freed me from the skirts                 830"
4035,ARGUMENT,"Of the blind vapour, opened to my view"
4036,ARGUMENT,Glory beyond all glory ever seen
4037,ARGUMENT,By waking sense or by the dreaming soul!
4038,ARGUMENT,"The appearance,[206] instantaneously disclosed,"
4039,ARGUMENT,Was of a mighty city--boldly say                             835
4040,ARGUMENT,"A wilderness of building, sinking far"
4041,ARGUMENT,"And self-withdrawn into a boundless[207] depth,"
4042,ARGUMENT,Far sinking into splendour--without end!
4043,ARGUMENT,"Fabric it seemed of diamond and of gold,"
4044,ARGUMENT,"With alabaster domes, and silver spires,                     840"
4045,ARGUMENT,"And blazing terrace upon terrace, high"

4047,ARGUMENT,"In avenues disposed; there, towers begirt"

4049,ARGUMENT,Bore stars--illumination of all gems!                        845

4051,ARGUMENT,Upon the dark materials of the storm
4052,ARGUMENT,"Now pacified; on them, and on the coves"
4053,ARGUMENT,"And mountain-steeps and summits, whereunto"
4054,ARGUMENT,"The vapours had receded, taking there                        850"
4055,ARGUMENT,Their station under a cerulean sky.
4056,ARGUMENT,"Oh, 'twas an unimaginable sight!"
4057,ARGUMENT,"Clouds, mists, streams, watery rocks and emerald turf,"
4058,ARGUMENT,"Clouds of all tincture, rocks and sapphire sky,"
4059,ARGUMENT,"Confused, commingled, mutually inflamed,                     855"
4060,ARGUMENT,"Molten together, and composing thus,"
4061,ARGUMENT,"Each lost in each, that marvellous array"
4062,ARGUMENT,"Of temple, palace, citadel, and huge"
4063,ARGUMENT,"Fantastic pomp of structure without name,"
4064,ARGUMENT,"In fleecy folds voluminous, enwrapped.                       860"
4065,ARGUMENT,"Right in the midst, where interspace appeared"
4066,ARGUMENT,"Of open court, an object like a throne"
4067,ARGUMENT,Under[208] a shining canopy of state
4068,ARGUMENT,Stood fixed; and fixed resemblances were seen
4069,ARGUMENT,"To implements of ordinary use,                               865"
4070,ARGUMENT,"But vast in size, in substance glorified;"
4071,ARGUMENT,Such as by Hebrew Prophets were beheld
4072,ARGUMENT,In vision[CQ]--forms uncouth of mightiest power
4073,ARGUMENT,For admiration and mysterious awe.
4074,ARGUMENT,"This little Vale, a dwelling-place of Man,[209]              870"
4075,ARGUMENT,Lay low beneath my feet; 'twas visible--
4076,ARGUMENT,"I saw not, but I felt that it was there."
4077,ARGUMENT,That which I _saw_ was the revealed abode
4078,ARGUMENT,Of Spirits in beatitude: my heart                            874
4079,ARGUMENT,"Swelled in my breast.--'I have been dead,' I cried,"
4080,ARGUMENT,'And now I live! Oh! wherefore _do_ I live?'
4081,ARGUMENT,And with that pang I prayed to be no more!--
4082,ARGUMENT,"--But I forget our Charge, as utterly"
4083,ARGUMENT,I then forgot him:--there I stood and gazed:
4084,ARGUMENT,"The apparition faded not away,                               880"
4085,ARGUMENT,And I descended.[CR]
4086,ARGUMENT,"""Having reached the house,"
4087,ARGUMENT,"I found its rescued inmate safely lodged,"
4088,ARGUMENT,"And in serene possession of himself,"
4089,ARGUMENT,Beside a fire whose genial warmth seemed met
4090,ARGUMENT,"By a faint shining from the heart, a gleam                   885"
4091,ARGUMENT,"Of comfort, spread over his pallid face.[210]"
4092,ARGUMENT,"Great show of joy the housewife made, and truly"
4093,ARGUMENT,Was glad to find her conscience set at ease;
4094,ARGUMENT,"And not less glad, for sake of her good name,"
4095,ARGUMENT,That the poor Sufferer had escaped with life.                890
4096,ARGUMENT,"But, though he seemed at first to have received"
4097,ARGUMENT,"No harm, and uncomplaining as before"
4098,ARGUMENT,"Went through his usual tasks, a silent change"
4099,ARGUMENT,Soon showed itself: he lingered three short weeks;
4100,ARGUMENT,And from the cottage hath been borne to-day.                 895
4101,ARGUMENT,
4102,ARGUMENT,"""So ends my dolorous tale, and glad I am"

4104,ARGUMENT,"And, with blithe air of open fellowship,"
4105,ARGUMENT,"Brought from the cupboard wine and stouter cheer,"
4106,ARGUMENT,"Like one who would be merry. Seeing this,                    900"

5666,ARGUMENT,"On Devon's leafy shores;[DI]--a sheltered hold,"
5667,ARGUMENT,In a soft clime encouraging the soil
5668,ARGUMENT,To a luxuriant bounty!--As our steps                         520
5669,ARGUMENT,Approach the embowered abode--our chosen seat--
5670,ARGUMENT,"See, rooted in the earth, her[254] kindly bed,"
5671,ARGUMENT,"The unendangered myrtle, decked with flowers,"
5672,ARGUMENT,Before the threshold stands to welcome us!
5673,ARGUMENT,"While, in the flowering myrtle's neighbourhood,              525"
5674,ARGUMENT,"Not overlooked but courting no regard,"
5675,ARGUMENT,"Those native plants, the holly and the yew,"
5676,ARGUMENT,Gave modest intimation to the mind
5677,ARGUMENT,How willingly their aid[255] they would unite
5678,ARGUMENT,"With the green myrtle, to endear the hours                   530"
5679,ARGUMENT,"Of winter, and protect that pleasant place."
5680,ARGUMENT,"--Wild were the walks upon those lonely Downs,[DJ]"
5681,ARGUMENT,"Track leading into track; how marked, how worn"
5682,ARGUMENT,"Into bright verdure, between fern and gorse,"
5683,ARGUMENT,Winding away its never ending line                           535
5684,ARGUMENT,"On their smooth surface, evidence was none:"
5685,ARGUMENT,"But, there, lay open to our daily haunt"
5686,ARGUMENT,"A range of unappropriated earth,"
5687,ARGUMENT,Where youth's ambitious feet might move at large;
5688,ARGUMENT,"Whence, unmolested wanderers, we beheld                      540"
5689,ARGUMENT,The shining giver of the day diffuse
5690,ARGUMENT,His brightness o'er a tract of sea and land
5691,ARGUMENT,"Gay as our spirits, free as our desires;"
5692,ARGUMENT,"As our enjoyments, boundless.--From those heights"
5693,ARGUMENT,"We dropped, at pleasure, into sylvan combs;[DJ]              545"
5694,ARGUMENT,"Where arbours of impenetrable shade,"
5695,ARGUMENT,"And mossy seats, detained us side by side,"
5696,ARGUMENT,"With hearts at ease, and knowledge in our hearts"
5697,ARGUMENT,'That all the grove and all the day was ours.'
5698,ARGUMENT,
5699,ARGUMENT,"""O happy time! still happier was at hand;                  550"
5700,ARGUMENT,For Nature called my Partner to resign
5701,ARGUMENT,"Her share in the pure freedom of that life,[256]"
5702,ARGUMENT,"Enjoyed by us in common.--To my hope,"
5703,ARGUMENT,"To my heart's wish, my tender Mate became"
5704,ARGUMENT,The thankful captive of maternal bonds;                      555
5705,ARGUMENT,And those wild paths were left to me alone.
5706,ARGUMENT,There could I meditate on follies past;
5707,ARGUMENT,"And, like a weary voyager escaped"
5708,ARGUMENT,"From risk and hardship, inwardly retrace"
5709,ARGUMENT,"A course of vain delights and thoughtless guilt,             560"
5710,ARGUMENT,And self-indulgence--without shame pursued.
5711,ARGUMENT,"There, undisturbed, could think of and could thank"
5712,ARGUMENT,Her whose submissive spirit was to me
5713,ARGUMENT,Rule and restraint--my guardian--shall I say
5714,ARGUMENT,"That earthly Providence, whose guiding love                  565"
5715,ARGUMENT,Within a port of rest had lodged me safe;
5716,ARGUMENT,"Safe from temptation, and from danger far?"
5717,ARGUMENT,Strains followed of acknowledgment addressed
5718,ARGUMENT,To an Authority enthroned above                              569
5719,ARGUMENT,"The reach of sight; from whom, as from their source,"
5720,ARGUMENT,Proceed all visible ministers of good
5721,ARGUMENT,"That walk the earth--Father of heaven and earth,"
5722,ARGUMENT,"Father, and king, and judge, adored and feared!"
5723,ARGUMENT,"These acts of mind, and memory, and heart,"
5724,ARGUMENT,And spirit--interrupted and relieved                         575
5725,ARGUMENT,By observations transient as the glance
5726,ARGUMENT,"Of flying sunbeams, or to the outward form"
5727,ARGUMENT,"Cleaving with power inherent and intense,"
5728,ARGUMENT,As the mute insect fixed upon the plant                      579
5729,ARGUMENT,"On whose soft leaves it hangs, and from whose cup"
5730,ARGUMENT,It draws its nourishment imperceptibly--[257]
5731,ARGUMENT,Endeared my wanderings; and the mother's kiss
5732,ARGUMENT,And infant's smile awaited my return.
5733,ARGUMENT,
5734,ARGUMENT,"""In privacy we dwelt, a wedded pair,"
5735,ARGUMENT,"Companions daily, often all day long;                        585"
5736,ARGUMENT,Not placed by fortune within easy reach
5737,ARGUMENT,"Of various intercourse, nor wishing aught"
5738,ARGUMENT,"Beyond the allowance of our own fire-side,"
5739,ARGUMENT,"The twain within our happy cottage born,"
5740,ARGUMENT,"Inmates, and heirs of our united love;                       590"
5741,ARGUMENT,"Graced mutually by difference of sex,"
5742,ARGUMENT,And with[258] no wider interval of time
5743,ARGUMENT,Between their several births than served for one
5744,ARGUMENT,To establish something of a leader's sway;
5745,ARGUMENT,Yet left them joined by sympathy in age;                     595
5746,ARGUMENT,"Equals in pleasure, fellows in pursuit."
5747,ARGUMENT,On these two pillars rested as in air
5748,ARGUMENT,Our solitude.
5749,ARGUMENT,"""It soothes me to perceive,"
5750,ARGUMENT,Your courtesy withholds not from my words
5751,ARGUMENT,"Attentive audience. But, oh! gentle Friends,                 600"
5752,ARGUMENT,"As times of quiet and unbroken peace,"
5753,ARGUMENT,"Though, for a nation, times of blessedness,"
5754,ARGUMENT,Give back faint echoes from the historian's page;
5755,ARGUMENT,"So, in the imperfect sounds of this discourse,"
5756,ARGUMENT,"Depressed I hear, how faithless is the voice                 605"
5757,ARGUMENT,Which those most blissful days reverberate.
5758,ARGUMENT,"What special record can, or need, be given"
5759,ARGUMENT,"To rules and habits, whereby much was done,"
5760,ARGUMENT,But all within the sphere of little things;
5761,ARGUMENT,"Of humble, though, to us, important cares,                   610"
5762,ARGUMENT,And precious interests? Smoothly did our life
5763,ARGUMENT,"Advance, swerving not[259] from the path prescribed;"
5764,ARGUMENT,"Her annual, her diurnal, round alike"
5765,ARGUMENT,Maintained with faithful care. And you divine
5766,ARGUMENT,The worst effects that[260] our condition saw                615
5767,ARGUMENT,"If you imagine changes slowly wrought,"
5768,ARGUMENT,And in their progress[261] unperceivable;[262]
5769,ARGUMENT,"Not wished for; sometimes noticed with a sigh,"
5770,ARGUMENT,(Whate'er of good or lovely they might bring)
5771,ARGUMENT,"Sighs of regret, for the familiar good                       620"
5772,ARGUMENT,And loveliness endeared which they removed.
5773,ARGUMENT,
5774,ARGUMENT,"""Seven years of occupation undisturbed"
5775,ARGUMENT,Established seemingly a right to hold
5776,ARGUMENT,That happiness; and use and habit gave
5777,ARGUMENT,To what an alien spirit had acquired                         625
5778,ARGUMENT,"A patrimonial sanctity. And thus,"
5779,ARGUMENT,"With thoughts and wishes bounded to this world,"
5780,ARGUMENT,I lived and breathed; most grateful--if to enjoy
5781,ARGUMENT,"Without repining or desire for more,"
5782,ARGUMENT,"For different lot, or change to higher sphere,               630"
5783,ARGUMENT,(Only except some impulses of pride
5784,ARGUMENT,"With no determined object, though upheld"
5785,ARGUMENT,By theories with suitable support)--
5786,ARGUMENT,"Most grateful, if in such wise to enjoy"
5787,ARGUMENT,Be proof of gratitude for what we have;                      635
5788,ARGUMENT,"Else, I allow, most thankless.--But, at once,"
5789,ARGUMENT,From some dark seat of fatal power was urged
5790,ARGUMENT,"A claim that shattered all.--Our blooming girl,"
5791,ARGUMENT,"Caught in the gripe of death, with such brief time"
5792,ARGUMENT,To struggle in as scarcely would allow                       640
5793,ARGUMENT,"Her cheek to change its colour, was conveyed"
5794,ARGUMENT,"From us to inaccessible worlds, to regions[263]"
5795,ARGUMENT,"Where height, or depth, admits not the approach"
5796,ARGUMENT,"Of living man, though longing to pursue."
5797,ARGUMENT,"--With even as brief a warning--and how soon,                645"
5798,ARGUMENT,"With what short interval of time between,"
5799,ARGUMENT,"I tremble yet to think of--our last prop,"
5800,ARGUMENT,Our happy life's only remaining stay--
5801,ARGUMENT,The brother followed; and was seen no more![DK]
5802,ARGUMENT,
5803,ARGUMENT,"""Calm as a frozen lake when ruthless winds                 650"
5804,ARGUMENT,"Blow fiercely, agitating earth and sky,"
5805,ARGUMENT,"The Mother now remained; as if in her,"
5806,ARGUMENT,"Who, to the lowest region of the soul,"
5807,ARGUMENT,"Had been erewhile unsettled and disturbed,"
5808,ARGUMENT,This second visitation had no power                          655
5809,ARGUMENT,To shake; but only to bind up and seal;
5810,ARGUMENT,And to establish thankfulness of heart
5811,ARGUMENT,"In Heaven's determinations, ever just."
5812,ARGUMENT,"The eminence whereon[264] her spirit stood,"
5813,ARGUMENT,Mine was unable to attain. Immense                           660
5814,ARGUMENT,"The space that severed us! But, as the sight"
5815,ARGUMENT,Communicates with heaven's ethereal orbs
5816,ARGUMENT,"Incalculably distant; so, I felt"
5817,ARGUMENT,That consolation may descend from far
5818,ARGUMENT,"(And that is intercourse, and union, too,)                   665"
5819,ARGUMENT,"While, overcome with speechless gratitude,"
5820,ARGUMENT,"And, with a holier love inspired, I looked"
5821,ARGUMENT,On her--at once superior to my woes
5822,ARGUMENT,And partner of my loss.--O heavy change!
5823,ARGUMENT,Dimness o'er this clear luminary crept                       670
5824,ARGUMENT,Insensibly;--the immortal and divine
5825,ARGUMENT,"Yielded to mortal reflux; her pure glory,"
5826,ARGUMENT,As from the pinnacle of worldly state
5827,ARGUMENT,"Wretched ambition drops astounded, fell"
5828,ARGUMENT,"Into a gulf obscure of silent grief,                         675"
5829,ARGUMENT,"And keen heart-anguish--of itself ashamed,"
5830,ARGUMENT,Yet obstinately cherishing itself:
5831,ARGUMENT,"And, so consumed, she melted from my arms;"
5832,ARGUMENT,"And left me, on this earth, disconsolate!"
5833,ARGUMENT,
5834,ARGUMENT,"""What followed cannot be reviewed in thought;              680"
5835,ARGUMENT,"Much less, retraced in words. If she, of life"
5836,ARGUMENT,"Blameless, so intimate with love and joy"
5837,ARGUMENT,"And all the tender motions of the soul,"
5838,ARGUMENT,"Had been supplanted, could I hope to stand--"
5839,ARGUMENT,"Infirm, dependent, and now destitute?                        685"
5840,ARGUMENT,"I called on dreams and visions, to disclose"
5841,ARGUMENT,That which is veiled from waking thought; conjured
5842,ARGUMENT,"Eternity, as men constrain a ghost"
5843,ARGUMENT,To appear and answer; to the grave I spake
5844,ARGUMENT,"Imploringly;--looked up, and asked the Heavens               690"
5845,ARGUMENT,"If Angels traversed their cerulean floors,"
5846,ARGUMENT,If fixed or wandering star could tidings yield
5847,ARGUMENT,Of the departed spirit--what abode
5848,ARGUMENT,It occupies--what consciousness retains
5849,ARGUMENT,Of former loves and interests. Then my soul                  695
5850,ARGUMENT,"Turned inward,--to examine of what stuff"
5851,ARGUMENT,Time's fetters are composed; and life was put
5852,ARGUMENT,"To inquisition, long and profitless!"
5853,ARGUMENT,By pain of heart--now checked--and now impelled--
5854,ARGUMENT,"The intellectual power, through words and things,            700"
5855,ARGUMENT,"Went sounding on, a dim and perilous way![DL]"
5856,ARGUMENT,"And from those transports, and these toils abstruse,"
5857,ARGUMENT,Some trace am I enabled to retain
5858,ARGUMENT,"Of time, else lost;--existing unto me"
5859,ARGUMENT,Only by records in myself not found.                         705
5860,ARGUMENT,
5861,ARGUMENT,"""From that abstraction I was roused,--and how?"
5862,ARGUMENT,Even as a thoughtful shepherd by a flash
5863,ARGUMENT,Of lightning startled in a gloomy cave
5864,ARGUMENT,"Of these wild hills. For, lo! the dread Bastile,[DM]"
5865,ARGUMENT,"With all the chambers in its horrid towers,                  710"
5866,ARGUMENT,Fell to the ground:--by violence overthrown
5867,ARGUMENT,Of indignation; and with shouts that drowned
5868,ARGUMENT,The crash it made in falling! From the wreck
5869,ARGUMENT,"A golden palace rose, or seemed to rise,"
5870,ARGUMENT,The appointed seat of equitable law                          715
5871,ARGUMENT,And mild paternal sway. The potent shock
5872,ARGUMENT,"I felt: the transformation I perceived,"
5873,ARGUMENT,As marvellously seized as in that moment
5874,ARGUMENT,"When, from the blind mist issuing, I beheld"
5875,ARGUMENT,"Glory--beyond all glory ever seen,                           720"
5876,ARGUMENT,"Confusion infinite of heaven and earth,"
5877,ARGUMENT,"Dazzling the soul. Meanwhile, prophetic harps"
5878,ARGUMENT,"In every grove were ringing, 'War shall cease;"
5879,ARGUMENT,Did ye not hear that conquest is abjured?
5880,ARGUMENT,"Bring garlands, bring forth choicest flowers, to deck        725"
5881,ARGUMENT,The tree of Liberty.'[DN]--My heart rebounded;
5882,ARGUMENT,My melancholy voice the chorus joined;
5883,ARGUMENT,"--'Be joyful all ye nations; in all lands,"
5884,ARGUMENT,Ye that are capable of joy be glad!
5885,ARGUMENT,"Henceforth, whate'er is wanting to yourselves                730"
5886,ARGUMENT,"In others ye shall promptly find;--and all,"
5887,ARGUMENT,"Enriched by mutual and reflected wealth,"
5888,ARGUMENT,Shall with one heart honour their common kind.'[265]
5889,ARGUMENT,
5890,ARGUMENT,"""Thus was I reconverted to the world;"
5891,ARGUMENT,"Society became my glittering bride,                          735"
5892,ARGUMENT,And airy hopes my children.--From the depths
5893,ARGUMENT,"Of natural passion, seemingly escaped,"
5894,ARGUMENT,My soul diffused herself[266] in wide embrace
5895,ARGUMENT,"Of institutions, and the forms of things,"
5896,ARGUMENT,"As they exist, in mutable array,                             740"
5897,ARGUMENT,"Upon life's surface. What, though in my veins"
5898,ARGUMENT,"There flowed no Gallic blood, nor had I breathed"
5899,ARGUMENT,"The air of France, not less than Gallic zeal"
5900,ARGUMENT,Kindled and burnt among the sapless twigs
5901,ARGUMENT,Of my exhausted heart. If busy men                           745
5902,ARGUMENT,"In sober conclave met, to weave a web"
5903,ARGUMENT,"Of amity, whose living threads should stretch"
5904,ARGUMENT,"Beyond the seas, and to the farthest pole,"
5905,ARGUMENT,"There did I sit, assisting. If, with noise"
5906,ARGUMENT,"And acclamation, crowds in open air                          750"
5907,ARGUMENT,"Expressed the tumult of their minds, my voice"
5908,ARGUMENT,"There mingled, heard or not. The powers of song"
5909,ARGUMENT,"I left not uninvoked; and, in still groves,"
5910,ARGUMENT,Where mild enthusiasts tuned a pensive lay
5911,ARGUMENT,"Of thanks and expectation, in accord                         755"
5912,ARGUMENT,"With their belief, I sang Saturnian rule"
5913,ARGUMENT,"Returned,--a progeny of golden years"
5914,ARGUMENT,"Permitted to descend, and bless mankind."
5915,ARGUMENT,--With promises the Hebrew Scriptures teem:
5916,ARGUMENT,I felt their[267] invitation; and resumed                    760
5917,ARGUMENT,A long-suspended office in the House
5918,ARGUMENT,"Of public worship, where, the glowing phrase"
5919,ARGUMENT,"Of ancient inspiration serving me,"
5920,ARGUMENT,"I promised also,--with undaunted trust"
5921,ARGUMENT,"Foretold, and added prayer to prophecy;                      765"
5922,ARGUMENT,The admiration winning of the crowd;
5923,ARGUMENT,The help desiring of the pure devout.
5924,ARGUMENT,
5925,ARGUMENT,"""Scorn and contempt forbid me to proceed!"
5926,ARGUMENT,"But History, time's slavish scribe, will tell"
5927,ARGUMENT,How rapidly the zealots of the cause                         770
5928,ARGUMENT,Disbanded--or in hostile ranks appeared;
5929,ARGUMENT,"Some, tired of honest service; these, outdone,"
5930,ARGUMENT,"Disgusted therefore, or appalled, by aims"
5931,ARGUMENT,"Of fiercer zealots--so confusion reigned,"
5932,ARGUMENT,"And the more faithful were compelled to exclaim,             775"
5933,ARGUMENT,"As Brutus did to Virtue, 'Liberty,"
5934,ARGUMENT,"I worshipped thee, and find thee but a Shade!'[DO]"
5935,ARGUMENT,
5936,ARGUMENT,"""Such recantation had for me no charm,"
5937,ARGUMENT,Nor would I bend to it; who should have grieved
5938,ARGUMENT,"At aught, however fair, that[268] bore the mien              780"
5939,ARGUMENT,"Of a conclusion, or catastrophe."
5940,ARGUMENT,"Why then conceal, that, when the simply[269] good"
5941,ARGUMENT,"In timid selfishness withdrew, I sought"
5942,ARGUMENT,"Other support, not scrupulous whence it came;"
5943,ARGUMENT,"And, by what compromise it stood, not nice?                  785"
5944,ARGUMENT,"Enough if notions seemed to be high-pitched,"
5945,ARGUMENT,And qualities determined.--Among men
5946,ARGUMENT,So charactered did I maintain a strife[270]
5947,ARGUMENT,"Hopeless, and still more hopeless every hour;"
5948,ARGUMENT,"But, in the process, I began to feel                         790"
5949,ARGUMENT,"That, if the emancipation of the world"
5950,ARGUMENT,"Were missed, I should at least secure my own,"
5951,ARGUMENT,"And be in part compensated. For rights,"
5952,ARGUMENT,"Widely--inveterately usurped upon,"
5953,ARGUMENT,I spake with vehemence; and promptly seized                  795
5954,ARGUMENT,All that[271] Abstraction furnished for my needs
5955,ARGUMENT,"Or purposes;[DP] nor scrupled to proclaim,"
5956,ARGUMENT,"And propagate, by liberty of life,"
5957,ARGUMENT,"Those new persuasions. Not that I rejoiced,"
5958,ARGUMENT,"Or even found pleasure, in such vagrant course,              800"
5959,ARGUMENT,For its own sake; but farthest from the walk
5960,ARGUMENT,"Which I had trod in happiness and peace,"
5961,ARGUMENT,Was most inviting to a troubled mind;
5962,ARGUMENT,"That, in a struggling and distempered world,"
5963,ARGUMENT,Saw a seductive image of herself.[272]                       805
5964,ARGUMENT,"Yet, mark the contradictions of which Man"
5965,ARGUMENT,"Is still the sport! Here Nature was my guide,"
5966,ARGUMENT,"The Nature of the dissolute; but thee,"
5967,ARGUMENT,O fostering Nature! I rejected--smiled
5968,ARGUMENT,At others' tears in pity; and in scorn                       810
5969,ARGUMENT,"At those, which thy soft influence sometimes drew"
5970,ARGUMENT,From my unguarded heart.--The tranquil shores
5971,ARGUMENT,"Of Britain circumscribed me; else, perhaps"
5972,ARGUMENT,"I might have been entangled among deeds,"
5973,ARGUMENT,"Which, now, as infamous, I should abhor--                    815"
5974,ARGUMENT,"Despise, as senseless: for my spirit relished"
5975,ARGUMENT,"Strangely the exasperation of that Land,"
5976,ARGUMENT,Which turned an angry beak against the down
5977,ARGUMENT,Of her own breast; confounded into hope
5978,ARGUMENT,Of disencumbering thus her fretful wings.[273]               820
5979,ARGUMENT,
5980,ARGUMENT,"""But all was quieted by iron bonds"
5981,ARGUMENT,"Of military sway. The shifting aims,"
5982,ARGUMENT,"The moral interests, the creative might,"
5983,ARGUMENT,The varied functions and high attributes
5984,ARGUMENT,"Of civil action, yielded to a power                          825"
5985,ARGUMENT,"Formal, and odious, and contemptible."
5986,ARGUMENT,"--In Britain, ruled a panic dread of change;"
5987,ARGUMENT,"The weak were praised, rewarded, and advanced;"
5988,ARGUMENT,"And, from the impulse of a just disdain,"
5989,ARGUMENT,Once more did I retire into myself.                          830
5990,ARGUMENT,"There feeling no contentment, I resolved"
5991,ARGUMENT,"To fly, for safeguard, to some foreign shore,"
5992,ARGUMENT,Remote from Europe; from her blasted hopes;
5993,ARGUMENT,"Her fields of carnage, and polluted air.                     834"
5994,ARGUMENT,
5995,ARGUMENT,"""Fresh blew the wind, when o'er the Atlantic Main"
5996,ARGUMENT,The ship went gliding with her thoughtless crew;
5997,ARGUMENT,"And who among them but an Exile, freed"
5998,ARGUMENT,"From discontent, indifferent, pleased to sit"
5999,ARGUMENT,"Among the busily-employed, not more"
6000,ARGUMENT,"With obligation charged, with service taxed,                 840"
6001,ARGUMENT,Than the loose pendant--to the idle wind
6002,ARGUMENT,"Upon the tall mast streaming. But, ye Powers"

8053,ARGUMENT,"For you, assuredly, a hopeful road[397]"
8054,ARGUMENT,Lies open: we have heard from you a voice
8055,ARGUMENT,At every moment softened in its course
8056,ARGUMENT,"By tenderness of heart; have seen your eye,                 1120"
8057,ARGUMENT,"Even like an altar lit by fire from heaven,"
8058,ARGUMENT,"Kindle before us.--Your discourse this day,"
8059,ARGUMENT,"That, like the fabled Lethe, wished to flow"
8060,ARGUMENT,"In creeping sadness, through oblivious shades"
8061,ARGUMENT,"Of death and night, has caught at every turn                1125"
8062,ARGUMENT,The colours of the sun. Access for you

8082,ARGUMENT,"Of ebb and flow, and ever-during power;                     1145"
8083,ARGUMENT,"And central peace, subsisting at the heart"
8084,ARGUMENT,"Of endless agitation. Here you stand,"

8086,ARGUMENT,Pious beyond the intention of your thought;

8089,ARGUMENT,The estate of man would be indeed forlorn
8090,ARGUMENT,If false conclusions of the reasoning power
8091,ARGUMENT,"Made the eye blind, and closed the passages                 1154"
8092,ARGUMENT,Through which the ear converses with the heart.
8093,ARGUMENT,"Has not the soul, the being of your life,"

8095,ARGUMENT,"In some calm season, when these lofty rocks"
8096,ARGUMENT,"At night's approach bring down the unclouded sky,"
8097,ARGUMENT,To rest upon their circumambient walls;                     1160
8098,ARGUMENT,"A temple framing of dimensions vast,"
8099,ARGUMENT,And yet not too enormous for the sound
8100,ARGUMENT,"Of human anthems,--choral song, or burst"
8101,ARGUMENT,"Sublime of instrumental harmony,"
8102,ARGUMENT,To glorify the Eternal! What if these                       1165
8103,ARGUMENT,Did never break the stillness that prevails
8104,ARGUMENT,"Here,--if the solemn nightingale[FV] be mute,"
8105,ARGUMENT,And the soft woodlark here did never chant
8106,ARGUMENT,"Her vespers,[FW]--Nature fails not to provide"
8107,ARGUMENT,Impulse and utterance. The whispering air                   1170
8108,ARGUMENT,"Sends inspiration from the shadowy heights,"
8109,ARGUMENT,And blind recesses of the caverned rocks;
8110,ARGUMENT,"The little rills, and waters numberless,"
8111,ARGUMENT,"Inaudible by daylight, blend their notes"

8117,ARGUMENT,"Unseen, perchance above all[400] power of sight--           1180"
8118,ARGUMENT,An iron knell! with echoes from afar
8119,ARGUMENT,"Faint--and still fainter--as the cry, with which"
8120,ARGUMENT,The wanderer accompanies her flight
8121,ARGUMENT,"Through the calm region, fades upon the ear,"

8129,ARGUMENT,Your cherished sullenness is forced to bend
8130,ARGUMENT,"Even here, where her amenities are sown"

8144,ARGUMENT,"And speak to social reason's inner sense,"
8145,ARGUMENT,With inarticulate language.
8146,ARGUMENT,"""For, the Man--"
8147,ARGUMENT,"Who, in this spirit, communes with the Forms"
8148,ARGUMENT,"Of nature, who with understanding heart"

8190,ARGUMENT,"The naked spirit, ceasing to deplore                        1250"
8191,ARGUMENT,The burthen of existence. Science then
8192,ARGUMENT,"Shall be a precious visitant; and then,"
8193,ARGUMENT,"And only then, be worthy of her name:"
8194,ARGUMENT,"For then her heart shall kindle; her dull eye,"

8217,ARGUMENT,"Poured forth with fervour in continuous stream,"
8218,ARGUMENT,"Such as, remote, 'mid savage wilderness,"

8220,ARGUMENT,"Into the hearing of assembled tribes,[408]"
8221,ARGUMENT,"In open circle seated round, and hushed                     1280"
8222,ARGUMENT,"As the unbreathing air, when not a leaf"
8223,ARGUMENT,Stirs in the mighty woods.--So did he speak:
8224,ARGUMENT,The words he uttered shall not pass away
8225,ARGUMENT,"Dispersed, like music that the wind takes up"
8226,ARGUMENT,"By snatches, and lets fall, to be forgotten;                1285"
8227,ARGUMENT,"No--they sank into me,[409] the bounteous gift"
8228,ARGUMENT,"Of one whom time and nature had made wise,"
8229,ARGUMENT,Gracing his doctrine[410] with authority
8230,ARGUMENT,Which hostile spirits silently allow;
8231,ARGUMENT,Of one accustomed to desires that feed                      1290
8232,ARGUMENT,On fruitage gathered from the tree of life;
8233,ARGUMENT,To hopes on knowledge and experience built;
8234,ARGUMENT,Of one in whom persuasion and belief
8235,ARGUMENT,"Had ripened into faith, and faith become"
8236,ARGUMENT,"A passionate intuition; whence the Soul,                    1295"
8237,ARGUMENT,"Though bound to earth by ties of pity and love,"
8238,ARGUMENT,From all injurious servitude was free.
8239,ARGUMENT,
8240,ARGUMENT,"The Sun, before his place of rest were reached,"
8241,ARGUMENT,"Had yet to travel far, but unto us,"
8242,ARGUMENT,"To us who stood low in that hollow dell,                    1300"
8243,ARGUMENT,"He had become invisible,--a pomp"
8244,ARGUMENT,Leaving behind of yellow radiance spread
8245,ARGUMENT,"Over[411] the mountain sides, in contrast bold"
8246,ARGUMENT,"With ample shadows, seemingly, no less                      1304"
8247,ARGUMENT,"Than those resplendent lights, his rich bequest;"
8248,ARGUMENT,A dispensation of his evening power.

8258,ARGUMENT,But we are kindly welcomed--promptly served
8259,ARGUMENT,With ostentatious zeal.--Along the floor
8260,ARGUMENT,Of the small Cottage in the lonely Dell
8261,ARGUMENT,A grateful couch was spread for our repose;
8262,ARGUMENT,"Where, in the guise of mountaineers, we lay,[415]           1320"
8263,ARGUMENT,"Stretched upon fragrant heath, and lulled by sound"
8264,ARGUMENT,"Of far-off torrents charming the still night,"

9476,ARGUMENT,A parting tribute to a spot that seemed                       15
9477,ARGUMENT,Like the fixed centre of a troubled world.
9478,ARGUMENT,Again I halted with reverted eyes;
9479,ARGUMENT,"The chain that would not slacken, was at length"

9481,ARGUMENT,"How vain, thought I, is it by change of place[424]            20"
9482,ARGUMENT,To seek that comfort which the mind denies;
9483,ARGUMENT,Yet trial and temptation oft are shunned

9511,ARGUMENT,Acknowledgments of gratitude sincere

9513,ARGUMENT,For my own peaceful lot and happy choice;
9514,ARGUMENT,A choice that from the passions of the world

9527,ARGUMENT,"Halting together on a rocky knoll,"
9528,ARGUMENT,Whence the bare road[429] descended rapidly                   65
9529,ARGUMENT,To the green meadows of another vale.[GD]
9530,ARGUMENT,
9531,ARGUMENT,Here did our pensive Host put forth his hand
9532,ARGUMENT,"In sign of farewell. ""Nay,"" the old Man said,"
9533,ARGUMENT,"""The fragrant air its coolness still retains;"

9536,ARGUMENT,"We must not part at this inviting hour."""
9537,ARGUMENT,"He yielded,[430] though reluctant; for his mind"
9538,ARGUMENT,Instinctively disposed him to retire
9539,ARGUMENT,"To his own covert; as a billow, heaved                        75"
9540,ARGUMENT,"Upon the beach, rolls back into the sea."
9541,ARGUMENT,--So we descend: and winding round a rock
9542,ARGUMENT,Attain a point that showed the valley--stretched
9543,ARGUMENT,"In length before us;[GE] and, not distant far,"
9544,ARGUMENT,"Upon a rising ground a grey church-tower,(GE)                 80"
9545,ARGUMENT,Whose battlements were screened by tufted trees.
9546,ARGUMENT,"And towards a crystal Mere, that lay beyond"
9547,ARGUMENT,"Among steep hills and woods embosomed, flowed"
9548,ARGUMENT,A copious stream with boldly-winding course;
9549,ARGUMENT,"Here traceable, there hidden--there again                     85"
9550,ARGUMENT,"To sight restored, and glittering in the sun."
9551,ARGUMENT,"On the stream's bank, and every where, appeared"
9552,ARGUMENT,"Fair dwellings, single, or in social knots;"
9553,ARGUMENT,"Some scattered o'er the level, others perched"
9554,ARGUMENT,"On the hill sides, a cheerful quiet scene,                    90"
9555,ARGUMENT,Now in its morning purity arrayed.
9556,ARGUMENT,
9557,ARGUMENT,"""As 'mid some happy valley of the Alps,"""
9558,ARGUMENT,"Said I, ""once happy, ere tyrannic power,"
9559,ARGUMENT,"Wantonly breaking in upon the Swiss,"
9560,ARGUMENT,"Destroyed their unoffending commonwealth,                     95"
9561,ARGUMENT,"A popular equality reigns here,"
9562,ARGUMENT,Save for yon stately House[GF] beneath whose roof
9563,ARGUMENT,"A rural lord might dwell.""--""No feudal pomp,"
9564,ARGUMENT,"Or power,"" replied the Wanderer, ""to that House"
9565,ARGUMENT,"Belongs, but there in his allotted Home                      100"
9566,ARGUMENT,"Abides, from year to year, a genuine Priest,[431]"
9567,ARGUMENT,"The shepherd of his flock; or, as a king"
9568,ARGUMENT,"Is styled, when most affectionately praised,"
9569,ARGUMENT,The father of his people. Such is he;
9570,ARGUMENT,"And rich and poor, and young and old, rejoice                105"
9571,ARGUMENT,Under his spiritual sway. He hath vouchsafed[432]
9572,ARGUMENT,To me some portion of a[433] kind regard;
9573,ARGUMENT,And something also of his inner mind
9574,ARGUMENT,Hath he imparted--but I speak of him
9575,ARGUMENT,As he is known to all.
9576,ARGUMENT,The calm delights                    110
9577,ARGUMENT,"Of unambitious piety he chose,"
9578,ARGUMENT,And learning's solid dignity; though born
9579,ARGUMENT,"Of knightly race, nor wanting powerful friends."
9580,ARGUMENT,"Hither,[434] in prime of manhood, he withdrew"
9581,ARGUMENT,From academic bowers. He loved the spot--                    115
9582,ARGUMENT,Who does not love his native soil?--he prized
9583,ARGUMENT,"The ancient rural character, composed"
9584,ARGUMENT,"Of simple manners, feelings unsupprest"
9585,ARGUMENT,"And undisguised, and strong and serious thought;"
9586,ARGUMENT,"A character reflected in himself,                            120"
9587,ARGUMENT,With such embellishment as well beseems
9588,ARGUMENT,His rank and sacred function. This deep vale
9589,ARGUMENT,"Winds far in reaches hidden from our sight,"
9590,ARGUMENT,And one a turreted manorial hall
9591,ARGUMENT,"Adorns, in which the good Man's ancestors                    125"
9592,ARGUMENT,Have dwelt through ages--Patrons of this Cure.
9593,ARGUMENT,"To them, and to his own judicious pains,[435]"
9594,ARGUMENT,"The Vicar's dwelling, and the whole domain,"
9595,ARGUMENT,Owes that presiding aspect which might well
9596,ARGUMENT,Attract your notice; statelier than could else               130
9597,ARGUMENT,"Have been bestowed, through[436] course of common chance,"
9598,ARGUMENT,"On an unwealthy mountain Benefice."""
9599,ARGUMENT,
9600,ARGUMENT,"This said, oft pausing,[437] we pursued our way;"
9601,ARGUMENT,Nor reached the village-churchyard[GG] till the sun
9602,ARGUMENT,"Travelling at steadier pace than ours, had risen             135"
9603,ARGUMENT,"Above the summits of the highest hills,"
9604,ARGUMENT,And round our path darted oppressive beams.
9605,ARGUMENT,
9606,ARGUMENT,"As chanced, the portals of the sacred Pile"
9607,ARGUMENT,"Stood open; and we entered. On my frame,"
9608,ARGUMENT,"At such transition from the fervid air,                      140"
9609,ARGUMENT,"A grateful coolness fell, that seemed to strike"
9610,ARGUMENT,"The heart, in concert with that temperate awe"
9611,ARGUMENT,And natural reverence which the place inspired.[GH]
9612,ARGUMENT,Not raised in[438] nice proportions was the pile;
9613,ARGUMENT,But large and massy; for duration built;                     145
9614,ARGUMENT,"With pillars crowded, and the roof upheld"
9615,ARGUMENT,"By naked rafters intricately crossed,"
9616,ARGUMENT,"Like leafless underboughs, in some thick wood,[439]"
9617,ARGUMENT,All withered by the depth of shade above.
9618,ARGUMENT,"Admonitory texts inscribed the walls,                        150"
9619,ARGUMENT,"Each, in its ornamental scroll, enclosed;"
9620,ARGUMENT,Each also crowned with winged heads--a pair
9621,ARGUMENT,Of rudely-painted Cherubim. The floor
9622,ARGUMENT,"Of nave and aisle, in unpretending guise,"
9623,ARGUMENT,Was occupied by oaken benches ranged                         155
9624,ARGUMENT,In seemly rows; the chancel only showed
9625,ARGUMENT,"Some vain distinctions, marks of earthly state"
9626,ARGUMENT,By immemorial privilege allowed;
9627,ARGUMENT,Though with the Encincture's special sanctity
9628,ARGUMENT,"But ill according. An heraldic shield,                       160"
9629,ARGUMENT,"Varying its tincture with the changeful light,"
9630,ARGUMENT,Imbued the altar-window; fixed aloft
9631,ARGUMENT,"A faded hatchment hung, and one by time"
9632,ARGUMENT,Yet undiscoloured.[440] A capacious pew
9633,ARGUMENT,"Of sculptured oak stood here, with drapery lined;            165"
9634,ARGUMENT,And marble monuments were here displayed
9635,ARGUMENT,Thronging the walls;[441] and on the floor beneath
9636,ARGUMENT,"Sepulchral stones appeared, with emblems graven"
9637,ARGUMENT,"And foot-worn epitaphs, and some with small"
9638,ARGUMENT,And shining effigies of brass inlaid.[GI]                    170
9639,ARGUMENT,
9640,ARGUMENT,"The tribute by these various records claimed,"
9641,ARGUMENT,"Duly we paid, each after each, and read[442]"
9642,ARGUMENT,"The ordinary chronicle of birth,"
9643,ARGUMENT,"Office, alliance, and promotion--all"
9644,ARGUMENT,"Ending in dust; of upright magistrates,                      175"
9645,ARGUMENT,"Grave doctors strenuous for the mother-church,"
9646,ARGUMENT,"And uncorrupted senators, alike"
9647,ARGUMENT,"To king and people true. A brazen plate,"
9648,ARGUMENT,"Not easily deciphered, told of one"
9649,ARGUMENT,Whose course of earthly honour was begun                     180
9650,ARGUMENT,In quality of page among the train
9651,ARGUMENT,"Of the eighth Henry, when he crossed the seas"
9652,ARGUMENT,"His royal state to show, and prove his strength"

9654,ARGUMENT,"Another tablet registered the death,                         185"
9655,ARGUMENT,"And praised the gallant bearing, of a Knight"
9656,ARGUMENT,Tried in the sea-fights of the second Charles.
9657,ARGUMENT,Near this brave Knight his father lay entombed;
9658,ARGUMENT,"And, to the silent language giving voice,"
9659,ARGUMENT,"I read,--how in his manhood's earlier day                    190"
9660,ARGUMENT,"He, 'mid the afflictions of intestine war,"
9661,ARGUMENT,"And rightful government subverted, found"
9662,ARGUMENT,One only solace--that he had espoused
9663,ARGUMENT,A virtuous Lady tenderly beloved
9664,ARGUMENT,For her benign perfections; and yet more                     195
9665,ARGUMENT,"Endeared to him, for this,[443] that, in her state"
9666,ARGUMENT,"Of wedlock richly crowned with Heaven's regard,"
9667,ARGUMENT,"She with a numerous issue filled his house,"
9668,ARGUMENT,"Who throve, like plants, uninjured by the storm"
9669,ARGUMENT,That laid their country waste. No need to speak              200
9670,ARGUMENT,Of less particular notices assigned
9671,ARGUMENT,"To Youth or Maiden gone before their time,"
9672,ARGUMENT,And Matrons and unwedded Sisters old;
9673,ARGUMENT,Whose charity and goodness were rehearsed
9674,ARGUMENT,In modest panegyric.
9675,ARGUMENT,"""These dim lines,                      205"
9676,ARGUMENT,"What would they tell?"" said I,--but, from the task"
9677,ARGUMENT,"Of puzzling out that faded narrative,"
9678,ARGUMENT,With whisper soft my venerable Friend
9679,ARGUMENT,"Called me; and, looking down the darksome aisle,"
9680,ARGUMENT,I saw the Tenant of the lonely vale                          210
9681,ARGUMENT,Standing apart; with curvèd arm reclined
9682,ARGUMENT,On the baptismal font; his pallid face
9683,ARGUMENT,"Upturned, as if his mind were rapt, or lost"
9684,ARGUMENT,"In some abstraction; gracefully he stood,"
9685,ARGUMENT,The semblance bearing of a sculptured form                   215
9686,ARGUMENT,That leans upon a monumental urn
9687,ARGUMENT,"In peace, from morn to night, from year to year."
9688,ARGUMENT,
9689,ARGUMENT,Him from that posture did the Sexton rouse;
9690,ARGUMENT,"Who entered, humming carelessly a tune,[GJ]"
9691,ARGUMENT,Continuation haply of the notes                              220
9692,ARGUMENT,"That had beguiled the work from which he came,"
9693,ARGUMENT,With spade and mattock o'er his shoulder hung;
9694,ARGUMENT,"To be deposited, for future need,"
9695,ARGUMENT,In their appointed place. The pale Recluse
9696,ARGUMENT,"Withdrew; and straight we followed,--to a spot               225"
9697,ARGUMENT,Where sun and shade were intermixed; for there
9698,ARGUMENT,"A broad oak, stretching forth its leafy arms"
9699,ARGUMENT,"From an adjoining pasture, overhung"
9700,ARGUMENT,Small space of that green churchyard with a light
9701,ARGUMENT,And pleasant awning.[GK] On the moss-grown wall              230
9702,ARGUMENT,My ancient Friend and I together took
9703,ARGUMENT,"Our seats; and thus the Solitary spake,"
9704,ARGUMENT,Standing before us:--
9705,ARGUMENT,"""Did you note the mien"
9706,ARGUMENT,"Of that self-solaced, easy-hearted churl,                    234"
9707,ARGUMENT,"Death's hireling, who scoops out his neighbour's grave,"
9708,ARGUMENT,"Or wraps an old acquaintance up in clay,"
9709,ARGUMENT,"All unconcerned as he would bind a sheaf,"
9710,ARGUMENT,Or plant a tree.[GL] And did you hear his voice?[444]
9711,ARGUMENT,I was abruptly summoned by the sound[445]
9712,ARGUMENT,"From some affecting images and thoughts,                     240"
9713,ARGUMENT,Which then were silent; but crave utterance now.
9714,ARGUMENT,
9715,ARGUMENT,"""Much,"" he continued, with dejected look,"
9716,ARGUMENT,"""Much, yesterday,[446] was said in glowing phrase"
9717,ARGUMENT,"Of our sublime dependencies, and hopes"
9718,ARGUMENT,For future states of being; and the wings                    245
9719,ARGUMENT,"Of speculation, joyfully outspread,"
9720,ARGUMENT,Hovered above our destiny on earth:
9721,ARGUMENT,"But stoop, and place the prospect of the soul"
9722,ARGUMENT,"In sober contrast with reality,"
9723,ARGUMENT,And man's substantial life. If this mute earth               250
9724,ARGUMENT,"Of what it holds could speak, and every grave"
9725,ARGUMENT,"Were as a volume, shut, yet capable"
9726,ARGUMENT,"Of yielding its contents to eye and ear,"
9727,ARGUMENT,"We should recoil, stricken with sorrow and shame,"

12123,ARGUMENT,"In silent pools, now in strong eddies chained;[584]"

12311,ARGUMENT,"Of day-spring, in the gloomy east, revealed,                 915"
12312,ARGUMENT,"And greets it with thanksgiving. 'Till this hour,'"
12313,ARGUMENT,"Thus, in her Mother's hearing Ellen spake,"
12314,ARGUMENT,'There was a stony region in my heart;

12326,ARGUMENT,They stayed not long.--The blameless Infant grew;
12327,ARGUMENT,The Child whom Ellen and her Mother loved                    931
12328,ARGUMENT,They soon were proud of; tended it and nursed;
12329,ARGUMENT,"A soothing comforter, although forlorn;"
12330,ARGUMENT,Like a poor singing-bird from distant lands;
12331,ARGUMENT,"Or a choice shrub, which he, who passes by                   935"
12332,ARGUMENT,"With vacant mind, not seldom may observe"

12343,ARGUMENT,"Trusting her child, she left their common home,"

12367,ARGUMENT,"Her own--deserted child!--Once, only once,"

12369,ARGUMENT,"And, on the burial-day, could scarcely gain"
12370,ARGUMENT,Permission to attend its obsequies.

12385,ARGUMENT,"Hither she came; here stood, and sometimes knelt[612]"
12386,ARGUMENT,"In the broad day, a rueful Magdalene!"
12387,ARGUMENT,So call her; for not only she bewailed

12394,ARGUMENT,"Those visitations, ceased to send her forth;                 995"
12395,ARGUMENT,"Or, to the garden's narrow bounds, confined."
12396,ARGUMENT,I failed not to remind them that they erred;
12397,ARGUMENT,"For holy Nature might not thus be crossed,"
12398,ARGUMENT,Thus wronged in woman's breast: in vain I pleaded--

12408,ARGUMENT,"And little would his presence, or proof given"
12409,ARGUMENT,"Of a relenting soul, have now availed;"
12410,ARGUMENT,"For, like a shadow, he was passed away                      1010"
12411,ARGUMENT,From Ellen's thoughts; had perished to her mind
12412,ARGUMENT,"For all concerns of fear, or hope, or love,"
12413,ARGUMENT,"Save only those which to their common shame,"
12414,ARGUMENT,And to his moral being appertained:
12415,ARGUMENT,"Hope from that quarter would, I know, have brought          1015"
12416,ARGUMENT,A heavenly comfort; there she recognised
12417,ARGUMENT,"An unrelaxing bond, a mutual need;"
12418,ARGUMENT,"There, and, as seemed, there only."
12419,ARGUMENT,"""She had built,[613]"

12426,ARGUMENT,"Meanwhile, relinquishing all other cares,                   1025"
12427,ARGUMENT,Her mind she strictly tutored to find peace
12428,ARGUMENT,"And pleasure in endurance. Much she thought,"

12430,ARGUMENT,"Upon her own unworthiness. To me,"
12431,ARGUMENT,"As to a spiritual comforter and friend,                     1030"
12432,ARGUMENT,Her heart she opened; and no pains were spared
12433,ARGUMENT,"To mitigate, as gently as I could,"
12434,ARGUMENT,"The sting of self-reproach, with healing words."
12435,ARGUMENT,Meek Saint! through patience glorified on earth!
12436,ARGUMENT,"In whom, as by her lonely hearth she sate,                  1035"
12437,ARGUMENT,The ghastly face of cold decay put on
12438,ARGUMENT,"A sun-like beauty, and appeared divine!"
12439,ARGUMENT,"May I not mention--that, within those[615] walls,"
12440,ARGUMENT,"In due observance of her pious wish,"
12441,ARGUMENT,The congregation joined with me in prayer                   1040
12442,ARGUMENT,For her soul's good? Nor was that office vain.
12443,ARGUMENT,"--Much did she suffer: but, if any friend,"
12444,ARGUMENT,"Beholding her condition, at the sight"
12445,ARGUMENT,"Gave way to words of pity or complaint,"
12446,ARGUMENT,"She stilled them with a prompt reproof, and said,           1045"
12447,ARGUMENT,'He who afflicts me knows what I can bear;
12448,ARGUMENT,"'And, when I fail, and can endure no more,"
12449,ARGUMENT,'Will mercifully take me to himself.'
12450,ARGUMENT,"So, through the cloud of death, her Spirit passed"
12451,ARGUMENT,Into that pure and unknown world of love                    1050
12452,ARGUMENT,Where injury cannot come:--and here is laid
12453,ARGUMENT,"The mortal Body by her Infant's side."""
12454,ARGUMENT,
12455,ARGUMENT,The Vicar ceased; and downcast looks made known
12456,ARGUMENT,That each had listened with his inmost heart.
12457,ARGUMENT,"For me, the emotion scarcely was less strong                1055"
12458,ARGUMENT,Or less benign than that which I had felt
12459,ARGUMENT,"When seated near my venerable Friend,"
12460,ARGUMENT,"Under[616] those shady elms, from him I heard"
12461,ARGUMENT,The story that retraced the slow decline
12462,ARGUMENT,"Of Margaret, sinking on the lonely heath                    1060"
12463,ARGUMENT,With the neglected house to which she clung.[617]
12464,ARGUMENT,--I noted that the Solitary's cheek
12465,ARGUMENT,"Confessed the power of nature.--Pleased though sad,"
12466,ARGUMENT,"More pleased than sad, the grey-haired Wanderer sate;"
12467,ARGUMENT,Thanks to his pure imaginative soul                         1065
12468,ARGUMENT,"Capacious and serene; his blameless life,"
12469,ARGUMENT,"His knowledge, wisdom, love of truth, and love"
12470,ARGUMENT,Of human kind! He was it who first broke
12471,ARGUMENT,"The pensive silence, saying:--"
12472,ARGUMENT,"""Blest are they"
12473,ARGUMENT,Whose sorrow rather is to suffer wrong                      1070
12474,ARGUMENT,"Than to do wrong, albeit[618] themselves have erred."
12475,ARGUMENT,This tale gives proof that Heaven most gently deals
12476,ARGUMENT,"With such, in their affliction.--Ellen's fate,"
12477,ARGUMENT,"Her tender spirit, and her contrite heart,"
12478,ARGUMENT,Call to my mind dark hints which I have heard               1075
12479,ARGUMENT,"Of one who died within this vale, by doom"
12480,ARGUMENT,"Heavier, as his offence was heavier far."
12481,ARGUMENT,"Where, Sir, I pray you, where are laid the bones"
12482,ARGUMENT,"Of Wilfred Armathwaite?"""
12483,ARGUMENT,"The Vicar answered,"
12484,ARGUMENT,"""In that green nook, close by the Church-yard wall,         1080"
12485,ARGUMENT,"Beneath yon hawthorn, planted by myself"
12486,ARGUMENT,"In memory and for warning, and in sign"
12487,ARGUMENT,"Of sweetness where dire anguish had been known,"
12488,ARGUMENT,Of reconcilement after deep offence--
12489,ARGUMENT,There doth he rest. No theme his fate supplies              1085
12490,ARGUMENT,For the smooth glozings of the indulgent world;
12491,ARGUMENT,Nor need the windings of his devious course
12492,ARGUMENT,"Be here retraced;--enough that, by mishap"
12493,ARGUMENT,"And venial error, robbed of competence,"
12494,ARGUMENT,"And her[619] obsequious shadow, peace of mind,              1090"
12495,ARGUMENT,He craved a substitute in troubled joy;
12496,ARGUMENT,"Against his conscience rose in arms, and, braving"
12497,ARGUMENT,"Divine displeasure, broke the marriage-vow.[620]"
12498,ARGUMENT,That which he had been weak enough to do
12499,ARGUMENT,"Was misery in remembrance; he was stung,                    1095"
12500,ARGUMENT,"Stung by his inward thoughts, and by the smiles"
12501,ARGUMENT,Of wife and children stung to agony.
12502,ARGUMENT,"Wretched at home, he gained no peace abroad;"
12503,ARGUMENT,"Ranged through the mountains, slept upon the earth,"
12504,ARGUMENT,"Asked comfort of the open air, and found                    1100"
12505,ARGUMENT,"No quiet in the darkness of the night,"
12506,ARGUMENT,No pleasure in the beauty of the day.
12507,ARGUMENT,His flock he slighted: his paternal fields
12508,ARGUMENT,"Became a clog to him, whose spirit wished"
12509,ARGUMENT,"To fly--but whither! And this gracious Church,              1105"
12510,ARGUMENT,That wears a look so full of peace and hope
12511,ARGUMENT,"And love, benignant mother of the vale,"
12512,ARGUMENT,How fair amid her brood of cottages!
12513,ARGUMENT,She was to him a sickness and reproach.
12514,ARGUMENT,Much to the last remained unknown: but this                 1110
12515,ARGUMENT,"Is sure, that through remorse and grief he died;"
12516,ARGUMENT,"Though pitied among men, absolved by God,"
12517,ARGUMENT,He could not find forgiveness in himself;
12518,ARGUMENT,Nor could endure the weight of his own shame.

12522,ARGUMENT,"That,[621] stretching boldly from the mountain side,"
12523,ARGUMENT,Carries into the centre of the vale
12524,ARGUMENT,Its rocks and woods--the Cottage where she dwelt;
12525,ARGUMENT,"And where yet dwells her faithful Partner, left             1120"
12526,ARGUMENT,(Full eight years past) the solitary prop
12527,ARGUMENT,Of many helpless Children. I begin
12528,ARGUMENT,With words that[622] might be prelude to a tale
12529,ARGUMENT,Of sorrow and dejection; but I feel
12530,ARGUMENT,"No sadness, when I think of what mine eyes                  1125"
12531,ARGUMENT,See daily in that happy family.
12532,ARGUMENT,--Bright garland form they for the pensive brow
12533,ARGUMENT,"Of their undrooping Father's widowhood,"
12534,ARGUMENT,"Those six fair Daughters, budding yet--not one,"
12535,ARGUMENT,"Not one of all the band, a full-blown flower.               1130"
12536,ARGUMENT,"Deprest, and desolate of soul, as once"
12537,ARGUMENT,"That Father was, and filled with anxious fear,"
12538,ARGUMENT,"Now, by experience taught, he stands assured,"
12539,ARGUMENT,"That God, who takes away, yet takes not half"
12540,ARGUMENT,"Of what he seems to take; or gives it back,                 1135"
12541,ARGUMENT,"Not to our prayer, but far beyond our prayer;"
12542,ARGUMENT,He gives it--the boon produce of a soil
12543,ARGUMENT,"Which our endeavours have refused to till,"
12544,ARGUMENT,"And hope hath never watered. The Abode,"
12545,ARGUMENT,"Whose grateful owner can attest these truths,               1140"
12546,ARGUMENT,"Even were the object nearer to our sight,"
12547,ARGUMENT,Would seem in no distinction to surpass
12548,ARGUMENT,The rudest habitations. Ye might think
12549,ARGUMENT,"That it had sprung self-raised from earth, or grown"
12550,ARGUMENT,"Out of the living rock, to be adorned                       1145"
12551,ARGUMENT,"By nature only; but, if thither led,"
12552,ARGUMENT,"Ye would discover, then, a studious work"

12555,ARGUMENT,"""Brought from the woods the honeysuckle twines"
12556,ARGUMENT,"Around the porch, and seems, in that trim place,            1150"
12557,ARGUMENT,A plant no longer wild; the cultured rose
12558,ARGUMENT,"There blossoms, strong in health, and will be soon"
12559,ARGUMENT,"Roof-high; the wild pink crowns the garden-wall,"
12560,ARGUMENT,And with the flowers are intermingled stones
12561,ARGUMENT,"Sparry and bright, rough scatterings[623] of the hills.     1155"
12562,ARGUMENT,"These ornaments, that fade not with the year,"
12563,ARGUMENT,A hardy Girl continues to provide;
12564,ARGUMENT,"Who, mounting fearlessly the rocky heights,"
12565,ARGUMENT,"Her Father's prompt attendant, does for him"
12566,ARGUMENT,"All that a boy could do, but with delight                   1160"
12567,ARGUMENT,"More keen and prouder daring; yet hath she,"
12568,ARGUMENT,"Within the garden, like the rest, a bed"
12569,ARGUMENT,"For her own flowers and favourite herbs, a space,"
12570,ARGUMENT,"By sacred charter, holden for her use."
12571,ARGUMENT,"--These, and whatever else the garden bears                 1165"
12572,ARGUMENT,"Of fruit or flower, permission asked or not,"
12573,ARGUMENT,I freely gather; and my leisure draws
12574,ARGUMENT,A not unfrequent pastime from the hum
12575,ARGUMENT,Of bees around their range of sheltered hives
12576,ARGUMENT,"Busy in that enclosure; while the rill,[624]                1170"
12577,ARGUMENT,"That sparkling thrids the rocks, attunes his voice"
12578,ARGUMENT,To the pure course of human life which there

12582,ARGUMENT,(Who could refrain?) and feed by stealth my sight
12583,ARGUMENT,"With prospect of the company within,"
12584,ARGUMENT,Laid open through the blazing window:--there
12585,ARGUMENT,I see the eldest Daughter at her wheel
12586,ARGUMENT,"Spinning amain, as if to overtake                           1180"
12587,ARGUMENT,"The never-halting time; or, in her turn,"

13750,ARGUMENT,"And visiting, though not with saintly zeal,"
13751,ARGUMENT,"Yet, when need was, with no reluctant will,"
13752,ARGUMENT,"The sick in body, or distrest in mind;"
13753,ARGUMENT,"And, by as salutary change, compelled"
13754,ARGUMENT,"To rise[641] from timely sleep, and meet the day             155"
13755,ARGUMENT,"With no engagement, in his thoughts, more proud"
13756,ARGUMENT,"Or splendid than his garden could afford,"
13757,ARGUMENT,"His fields, or mountains by the heath-cock ranged,"
13758,ARGUMENT,Or the[642] wild brooks; from which he now returned
13759,ARGUMENT,Contented to partake the quiet meal                          160
13760,ARGUMENT,"Of his own board,[643] where sat his gentle Mate"
13761,ARGUMENT,"And three fair Children, plentifully fed"
13762,ARGUMENT,"Though simply, from their little household farm;"
13763,ARGUMENT,Nor wanted timely treat[644] of fish or fowl
13764,ARGUMENT,By nature yielded to his practised hand;--                   165
13765,ARGUMENT,To help the small but certain comings-in
13766,ARGUMENT,Of that spare benefice. Yet not the less
13767,ARGUMENT,"Theirs was a hospitable board, and theirs"
13768,ARGUMENT,A charitable door.
13769,ARGUMENT,"""So days and years"
13770,ARGUMENT,Passed on;--the inside of that rugged house                  170
13771,ARGUMENT,"Was trimmed and brightened by the Matron's care,"
13772,ARGUMENT,"And gradually enriched with things of price,"
13773,ARGUMENT,Which might be lacked for use or ornament.
13774,ARGUMENT,"What, though no soft and costly sofa there"
13775,ARGUMENT,"Insidiously stretched out its lazy length,                   175"
13776,ARGUMENT,"And no vain mirror glittered upon[645] the walls,"
13777,ARGUMENT,Yet were the windows of the low abode
13778,ARGUMENT,"By shutters weather-fended, which[646] at once"
13779,ARGUMENT,Repelled the storm and deadened its loud roar.
13780,ARGUMENT,There snow-white curtains hung in decent folds;              180
13781,ARGUMENT,"Tough moss, and long-enduring mountain plants,"
13782,ARGUMENT,"That creep along the ground with sinuous trail,"
13783,ARGUMENT,Were nicely braided; and composed a work
13784,ARGUMENT,"Like Indian mats, that with appropriate grace"
13785,ARGUMENT,Lay at the threshold and the inner doors;                    185
13786,ARGUMENT,"And a fair carpet, woven of homespun wool"
13787,ARGUMENT,"But tinctured daintily with florid hues,"
13788,ARGUMENT,"For seemliness and warmth, on festal[647] days,"
13789,ARGUMENT,Covered the smooth blue slabs of mountain-stone
13790,ARGUMENT,"With which the parlour-floor, in simplest guise              190"
13791,ARGUMENT,"Of pastoral homesteads, had been long inlaid.[IL]"
13792,ARGUMENT,
13793,ARGUMENT,"""Those[648] pleasing works the Housewife's skill produced:"
13794,ARGUMENT,Meanwhile the unsedentary Master's hand
13795,ARGUMENT,"Was busier with his task--to rid, to plant,"
13796,ARGUMENT,"To rear for food, for shelter, and delight;                  195"
13797,ARGUMENT,"A thriving covert! And when wishes, formed"
13798,ARGUMENT,"In youth, and sanctioned by the riper mind,"
13799,ARGUMENT,"Restored me to my native valley, here"
13800,ARGUMENT,To end my days; well pleased was I to see
13801,ARGUMENT,"The once-bare cottage, on the mountain-side,                 200"
13802,ARGUMENT,Screen'd from assault of every bitter blast;
13803,ARGUMENT,While the dark shadows of the summer leaves
13804,ARGUMENT,"Danced in the breeze, chequering its mossy roof.[649]"
13805,ARGUMENT,"Time, which had thus afforded willing help"
13806,ARGUMENT,To beautify with nature's fairest growths[650]               205
13807,ARGUMENT,"This rustic tenement, had gently shed,"
13808,ARGUMENT,"Upon its Master's frame, a wintry grace;"
13809,ARGUMENT,The comeliness of unenfeebled age.
13810,ARGUMENT,
13811,ARGUMENT,"""But how could I say, gently? for he still"
13812,ARGUMENT,"Retained a flashing eye, a burning palm,                     210"
13813,ARGUMENT,"A stirring foot, a[651] head which beat at nights"
13814,ARGUMENT,Upon its pillow with a thousand schemes.
13815,ARGUMENT,"Few likings had he dropped, few pleasures lost;"
13816,ARGUMENT,"Generous and charitable, prompt to serve;"
13817,ARGUMENT,And still his harsher passions kept their hold--             215
13818,ARGUMENT,Anger and indignation. Still he loved
13819,ARGUMENT,"The sound of titled names, and talked in glee"
13820,ARGUMENT,Of long-past banquetings with high-born friends:
13821,ARGUMENT,"Then, from those lulling fits of vain delight"
13822,ARGUMENT,"Uproused by recollected injury, railed                       220"
13823,ARGUMENT,"At their false ways disdainfully,--and oft"
13824,ARGUMENT,"In bitterness, and with a threatening eye"
13825,ARGUMENT,"Of fire, incensed beneath its hoary brow."
13826,ARGUMENT,"--Those[652] transports, with staid looks of pure good-will,"
13827,ARGUMENT,"And with soft smile, his consort would reprove.              225"
13828,ARGUMENT,"She, far behind him in the race of years,"
13829,ARGUMENT,"Yet keeping her first mildness, was advanced"
13830,ARGUMENT,"Far nearer, in the habit of her soul,"
13831,ARGUMENT,To that still region whither all are bound.
13832,ARGUMENT,Him might we liken to the setting sun                        230
13833,ARGUMENT,"As seen not seldom[653] on some gusty day,"
13834,ARGUMENT,"Struggling and bold, and shining from the west"
13835,ARGUMENT,With an inconstant and unmellowed light;
13836,ARGUMENT,"She was a soft attendant cloud, that hung"
13837,ARGUMENT,As if with wish to veil the restless orb;                    235
13838,ARGUMENT,From which it did itself imbibe a ray
13839,ARGUMENT,Of pleasing lustre.--But no more of this;
13840,ARGUMENT,I better love to sprinkle on the sod
13841,ARGUMENT,"That[654] now divides the pair, or rather say,"
13842,ARGUMENT,"That[655] still unites them, praises, like heaven's dew,     240"
13843,ARGUMENT,Without reserve descending[656] upon both.

13852,ARGUMENT,"On those high peaks, the first autumnal snow,"
13853,ARGUMENT,"Before the greedy visiting was closed,                       250"
13854,ARGUMENT,And the long-privileged house left empty--swept
13855,ARGUMENT,As by a plague.[IM] Yet no rapacious plague

13859,ARGUMENT,"Sweet, perfect, to be wished for! save that here"
13860,ARGUMENT,Was something which to mortal sense might sound
13861,ARGUMENT,"Like harshness,--that the old grey-headed Sire,"
13862,ARGUMENT,"The oldest, he was taken last, survived"
13863,ARGUMENT,"When the meek Partner of his age, his Son,                   260"

16028,ARGUMENT,"Figure and mien, complexion and attire,"

16031,ARGUMENT,For the least boon that pity can bestow.
16032,ARGUMENT,Such on the breast of darksome heaths are found;

16034,ARGUMENT,Of furze-clad commons; such are born and reared
16035,ARGUMENT,At the mine's mouth under[770] impending rocks;              365

16038,ARGUMENT,"For the convenience of unlawful gain,"
16039,ARGUMENT,"In forest purlieus; and the like are bred,"

16045,ARGUMENT,Such (we will hope the lowest in the scale)                  375

16051,ARGUMENT,"Heels over head, like tumblers on a stage."

16053,ARGUMENT,"And, on the freight of merry passengers"
16054,ARGUMENT,"Fixing a steady eye, maintain their speed;"

16060,ARGUMENT,"These, bred to little pleasure in themselves,                390"
16061,ARGUMENT,Are profitless to others.
16062,ARGUMENT,"""Turn we then"
16063,ARGUMENT,To Britons born and bred within the pale
16064,ARGUMENT,"Of civil polity, and early trained"

16066,ARGUMENT,The bread they eat. A sample should I give                   395
16067,ARGUMENT,Of what this stock hath long produced to enrich

16080,ARGUMENT,"Two eyes--not dim, but of a healthy[777] stare--"
16081,ARGUMENT,"Wide, sluggish, blank, and ignorant, and strange--"
16082,ARGUMENT,Proclaiming boldly that they never drew                      411
16083,ARGUMENT,A look or motion of intelligence
16084,ARGUMENT,"From infant-conning of the Christ-cross-row,[KF]"
16085,ARGUMENT,"Or puzzling through a primer, line by line,"
16086,ARGUMENT,Till perfect mastery crown the pains at last.                415
16087,ARGUMENT,"--What kindly warmth from touch of fostering hand,"
16088,ARGUMENT,"What penetrating power of sun or breeze,"
16089,ARGUMENT,Shall e'er dissolve the crust wherein his soul
16090,ARGUMENT,"Sleeps, like a caterpillar sheathed in ice?"
16091,ARGUMENT,This torpor is no pitiable work                              420
16092,ARGUMENT,Of modern ingenuity; no town
16093,ARGUMENT,Nor crowded city can[778] be taxed with aught
16094,ARGUMENT,"Of sottish vice or desperate breach of law,"
16095,ARGUMENT,To which (and who can tell where or how soon?)

16100,ARGUMENT,"The sceptre of his sway; his country's name,"
16101,ARGUMENT,"Her equal rights, her churches and her schools--             430"
16102,ARGUMENT,"What have they done for him? And, let me ask,"

16107,ARGUMENT,To whom the appeal couched in its[783] closing words         435
16108,ARGUMENT,Was pointedly addressed; and to the thoughts
16109,ARGUMENT,"That,[784] in assent or opposition, rose"
16110,ARGUMENT,"Within his mind, he seemed prepared to give"
16111,ARGUMENT,Prompt utterance; but the Vicar interposed[785]
16112,ARGUMENT,With invitation urgently[786] renewed.                       440
16113,ARGUMENT,"--We followed, taking as he led, a path"
16114,ARGUMENT,"Along a hedge of hollies dark and tall,[787][KG]"
16115,ARGUMENT,Whose flexile boughs low bending with a weight[788]
16116,ARGUMENT,"Of leafy spray, concealed the stems and roots"
16117,ARGUMENT,That gave them nourishment. When frosty winds                445
16118,ARGUMENT,"Howl from the north, what kindly warmth, methought,"
16119,ARGUMENT,Is here--how grateful this impervious screen![789]
16120,ARGUMENT,--Not shaped by simple wearing of the foot
16121,ARGUMENT,On rural business passing to and fro
16122,ARGUMENT,Was the commodious walk: a careful hand                      450
16123,ARGUMENT,"Had marked the line, and strewn its[790] surface o'er"
16124,ARGUMENT,"With pure cerulean gravel,[KH] from the heights"
16125,ARGUMENT,Fetched by a[791] neighbouring brook.--Across the vale
16126,ARGUMENT,The stately fence accompanied our steps;
16127,ARGUMENT,"And thus the pathway, by perennial green                     455"
16128,ARGUMENT,"Guarded and graced, seemed fashioned to unite,"
16129,ARGUMENT,"As by a beautiful yet solemn chain,"
16130,ARGUMENT,The Pastor's mansion with the house of prayer.
16131,ARGUMENT,
16132,ARGUMENT,"Like image of solemnity, conjoined"
16133,ARGUMENT,"With feminine allurement soft and fair,                      460"
16134,ARGUMENT,The mansion's self displayed;--a reverend pile
16135,ARGUMENT,With bold projections and recesses deep;
16136,ARGUMENT,"Shadowy, yet gay and lightsome as it stood"
16137,ARGUMENT,Fronting the noontide sun. We paused to admire
16138,ARGUMENT,"The pillared porch, elaborately embossed;                    465"
16139,ARGUMENT,The low wide windows with their mullions old;
16140,ARGUMENT,"The cornice, richly fretted, of grey stone;"
16141,ARGUMENT,"And that smooth slope from which the dwelling rose,"
16142,ARGUMENT,By beds and banks Arcadian of gay flowers
16143,ARGUMENT,"And flowering shrubs, protected and adorned:                 470"
16144,ARGUMENT,Profusion bright! and every flower assuming
16145,ARGUMENT,"A more than natural vividness of hue,"
16146,ARGUMENT,From unaffected contrast with the gloom
16147,ARGUMENT,"Of sober cypress, and the darker foil"
16148,ARGUMENT,"Of yew, in which survived some traces, here                  475"
16149,ARGUMENT,"Not unbecoming, of grotesque device"
16150,ARGUMENT,And uncouth fancy. From behind the roof
16151,ARGUMENT,"Rose the slim ash and massy sycamore,"
16152,ARGUMENT,Blending their diverse foliage with the green
16153,ARGUMENT,"Of ivy, flourishing and thick, that clasped                  480"
16154,ARGUMENT,"The huge round chimneys, harbour of delight"
16155,ARGUMENT,"For wren and redbreast,--where they sit and sing"
16156,ARGUMENT,Their slender ditties when the trees are bare.
16157,ARGUMENT,Nor must I leave untouched (the picture else
16158,ARGUMENT,Were incomplete) a relique of old times[792]                 485
16159,ARGUMENT,"Happily spared, a little Gothic niche"
16160,ARGUMENT,Of nicest workmanship; that[793] once had held
16161,ARGUMENT,"The sculptured image of some patron-saint,"
16162,ARGUMENT,"Or of the blessed Virgin, looking down"
16163,ARGUMENT,On all who entered those religious doors.                    490
16164,ARGUMENT,
16165,ARGUMENT,But lo! where from the cocky garden-mount
16166,ARGUMENT,"Crowned by its antique summer-house--descends,"
16167,ARGUMENT,"Light as the silver fawn, a radiant Girl;"
16168,ARGUMENT,"For she hath recognised her honoured friend,"
16169,ARGUMENT,The Wanderer ever welcome! A prompt kiss                     495
16170,ARGUMENT,The gladsome Child bestows at his request;
16171,ARGUMENT,"And, up the flowery lawn as we advance,"
16172,ARGUMENT,"Hangs on the old Man with a happy look,"
16173,ARGUMENT,And with a pretty restless hand of love.
16174,ARGUMENT,--We enter--by the Lady of the place                         500
16175,ARGUMENT,Cordially greeted. Graceful was her port:[794]
16176,ARGUMENT,"A lofty stature undepressed by time,"
16177,ARGUMENT,Whose visitation had not wholly spared[795]
16178,ARGUMENT,The finer lineaments of form[796] and face;
16179,ARGUMENT,To that complexion brought which prudence trusts in
16180,ARGUMENT,And wisdom loves.--But when a stately ship                   506
16181,ARGUMENT,Sails in smooth weather by the placid coast[KI]
16182,ARGUMENT,"On homeward voyage, what--if wind and wave,"
16183,ARGUMENT,"And hardship undergone in various climes,"
16184,ARGUMENT,"Have caused her to abate the virgin pride,                   510"
16185,ARGUMENT,And that full trim of inexperienced hope
16186,ARGUMENT,"With which she left her haven--not for this,"
16187,ARGUMENT,"Should the sun strike her, and the impartial breeze"
16188,ARGUMENT,"Play on her streamers, fails she[797] to assume"
16189,ARGUMENT,"Brightness and touching beauty of her own,                   515"
16190,ARGUMENT,"That charm all eyes. So bright, so fair, appeared[798]"
16191,ARGUMENT,"This goodly Matron, shining in the beams"
16192,ARGUMENT,Of unexpected pleasure.--Soon the board
16193,ARGUMENT,"Was spread, and we partook a plain repast."
16194,ARGUMENT,
16195,ARGUMENT,"Here, resting in cool shelter, we beguiled[799]            520"
16196,ARGUMENT,The mid-day hours with desultory talk;
16197,ARGUMENT,From trivial themes to general argument
16198,ARGUMENT,"Passing, as accident or fancy led,"
16199,ARGUMENT,Or courtesy prescribed. While question rose
16200,ARGUMENT,"And answer flowed, the fetters of reserve                    525"
16201,ARGUMENT,"Dropping from every mind, the Solitary[800]"
16202,ARGUMENT,Resumed the manners of his happier days;
16203,ARGUMENT,And[801] in the various conversation bore
16204,ARGUMENT,"A willing, nay,[802] at times, a forward part;"
16205,ARGUMENT,Yet with the grace of one who in the world                   530
16206,ARGUMENT,"Had learned the art of pleasing, and had now"
16207,ARGUMENT,"Occasion given him to display his skill,"
16208,ARGUMENT,Upon the stedfast 'vantage-ground of truth.
16209,ARGUMENT,"He gazed, with admiration unsuppressed,"
16210,ARGUMENT,"Upon the landscape of the sun-bright vale,                   535"
16211,ARGUMENT,"Seen, from the shady room in which we sate,"
16212,ARGUMENT,In softened pérspective; and more than once
16213,ARGUMENT,Praised the consummate harmony serene
16214,ARGUMENT,"Of gravity and elegance, diffused"
16215,ARGUMENT,Around the mansion and its whole domain;                     540
16216,ARGUMENT,"Not, doubtless, without help of female taste"
16217,ARGUMENT,"And female care.--""A blessed lot is yours!"""
16218,ARGUMENT,"The words escaped his lip, with a tender sigh"
16219,ARGUMENT,Breathed over them: but suddenly the door
16220,ARGUMENT,"Flew open, and a pair of lusty Boys[803]                     545"
16221,ARGUMENT,"Appeared, confusion checking their delight."
16222,ARGUMENT,"--Not brothers they in feature or attire,"
16223,ARGUMENT,"But fond companions, so I guessed, in field,"
16224,ARGUMENT,"And by the river's margin--whence they come,"
16225,ARGUMENT,Keen anglers with unusual spoil elated.[804]                 550
16226,ARGUMENT,"One bears a willow-pannier on his back,"
16227,ARGUMENT,"The boy of plainer garb, whose blush survives"
16228,ARGUMENT,More deeply tinged. Twin might the other be
16229,ARGUMENT,To that fair girl who from the garden-mount
16230,ARGUMENT,Bounded:--triumphant entry this for him![805]                555
16231,ARGUMENT,"Between his hands he holds a smooth blue stone,"
16232,ARGUMENT,On whose capacious surface see[806] outspread
16233,ARGUMENT,Large store of gleaming crimson-spotted trouts;
16234,ARGUMENT,"Ranged side by side, and lessening by degrees[807]"
16235,ARGUMENT,Up to the dwarf that tops the pinnacle.                      560
16236,ARGUMENT,Upon the board he lays the sky-blue stone
16237,ARGUMENT,With its rich freight;[808] their number he proclaims;
16238,ARGUMENT,Tells from what pool the noblest had been dragged;
16239,ARGUMENT,"And where the very monarch of the brook,"
16240,ARGUMENT,"After long struggle, had escaped at last--                   565"
16241,ARGUMENT,Stealing alternately at them and us
16242,ARGUMENT,(As doth his comrade too) a look of pride:
16243,ARGUMENT,"And, verily, the silent creatures made"
16244,ARGUMENT,"A splendid sight, together thus exposed;"
16245,ARGUMENT,"Dead--but not sullied or deformed by death,                  570"
16246,ARGUMENT,That seemed to pity what he could not spare.
16247,ARGUMENT,
16248,ARGUMENT,"But O, the animation in the mien"
16249,ARGUMENT,Of those two boys! yea in the very words
16250,ARGUMENT,"With which the young narrator was inspired,"
16251,ARGUMENT,"When, as our questions led, he told at large                 575"
16252,ARGUMENT,"Of that day's prowess! Him might I compare,"
16253,ARGUMENT,"His looks,[809] tones, gestures, eager eloquence,"
16254,ARGUMENT,"To a bold brook that[810] splits for better speed,"
16255,ARGUMENT,"And at the self-same moment, works its way"
16256,ARGUMENT,"Through many channels, ever and anon                         580"
16257,ARGUMENT,Parted and re-united: his compeer
16258,ARGUMENT,"To the still lake, whose stillness is to sight[811]"
16259,ARGUMENT,As beautiful--as grateful to the mind.
16260,ARGUMENT,--But to what object shall the lovely Girl
16261,ARGUMENT,Be likened? She whose countenance and air                    585
16262,ARGUMENT,"Unite the graceful qualities of both,"
16263,ARGUMENT,Even as she shares the pride and joy of both.
16264,ARGUMENT,
16265,ARGUMENT,My grey-haired Friend was moved; his vivid eye
16266,ARGUMENT,"Glistened with tenderness; his mind, I knew,"
16267,ARGUMENT,"Was full; and had, I doubted not, returned,                  590"
16268,ARGUMENT,"Upon this impulse, to the theme--erewhile"
16269,ARGUMENT,Abruptly broken off. The ruddy boys
16270,ARGUMENT,"Withdrew, on summons to their well-earned meal;[812]"
16271,ARGUMENT,And He--to whom all tongues resigned their rights
16272,ARGUMENT,"With willingness, to whom the general ear                    595"
16273,ARGUMENT,Listened with readier patience than to strain
16274,ARGUMENT,"Of music, lute or harp, a long delight"
16275,ARGUMENT,That ceased not when his voice had ceased--as One
16276,ARGUMENT,Who from truth's central point serenely views
16277,ARGUMENT,The compass of his argument--began                           600

17490,ARGUMENT,"Who, bearing each a basket on his arm,"

17494,ARGUMENT,"Wishful to leave an opening for my choice,                   480"

19128,NOTE E,Many particulars regarding John Gough may be found in Cornelius
19129,NOTE E,"Nicholson's _Annals of Kendal_, pp. 355-368 (Whitaker and Coy., 1861)."
19130,NOTE E,"He was born in 1757 and died in 1825. ""Before the completion of his"
19131,NOTE E,"third year, he was attacked with small-pox, which deprived him of his"
19132,NOTE E,sight. The whole globe of the left eye was destroyed: the damage done
19133,NOTE E,"to the other was not so extensive: for, though the greater part of the"
19134,NOTE E,"cornea was rendered opaque, there was a minute pellucid speck to the"
19135,NOTE E,"right of the pupil, which permitted a ray of light to fall upon the verge"
19136,NOTE E,"of the retina, and thus he was enabled to distinguish between day and"
19137,NOTE E,night: but he had no perception of the form or colour of objects around
19138,NOTE E,"him; so that, for all useful purposes, vision was completely lost."" But"
19139,NOTE E,"his marvellous sense of touch, as described by Wordsworth, was in no"
19140,NOTE E,"degree exaggerated. In his eighth summer, he began the study of botany;"
19141,NOTE E,"and pursued it systematically in his thirteenth year. ""His method of"
19142,NOTE E,examining plants must be briefly told. Systems of classification were but
19143,NOTE E,"little valued, except so far as they aided him in recognising individual"
19144,NOTE E,"form. The plant to be examined was held by the root or base in one hand,"
19145,NOTE E,"while the fingers of the other travelled slowly upwards, over the stem,"
19146,NOTE E,"branches, and leaves, till they reached the flower. If the species had"
19147,NOTE E,"been already met with, this procedure was sufficient for its recognition;"
19148,NOTE E,"if it proved to be a novelty, its class was first determined by the"
19149,NOTE E,insertion of the tip of his tongue within the flower: thus he discovered
19150,NOTE E,the number and arrangement of the stamens and pistils. When the flower
19151,NOTE E,was small he requested his reader to ascertain these points with a lens.
19152,NOTE E,"The class and order being determined, the genus was next worked out, word"
19153,NOTE E,"by word of the description, so far at least as the state of the specimen"
19154,NOTE E,would allow. But his perceptive power over form was most conspicuous in
19155,NOTE E,the analysis of species. It was truly wonderful to witness the rapidity
19156,NOTE E,"with which his fingers ran among the leaves, taking cognizance of their"
19157,NOTE E,"divisions, shape, serratures, and of the presence or absence of hairs."
19158,NOTE E,"The finest down was detected, by a stem or leaf being drawn gently"
19159,NOTE E,"across the border of his lower lip; so fine, indeed, that a young eye"
19160,NOTE E,often required a lens to verify the truth of the perception. Another
19161,NOTE E,peculiarity is worthy of notice. Repeated perusal of descriptions had
19162,NOTE E,"enabled him to prefigure in his mind's eye, the form without the presence"
19163,NOTE E,"of specimens; so that, when a species for the first time came within"
19164,NOTE E,"his touch, he at once named it from memory.... It was, probably, on one"
19165,NOTE E,"of these occasions, that Mr. Wordsworth, while describing the little"
19166,NOTE E,"cushion-like plant, with white roots and purple flowers, growing near"
19167,NOTE E,"Grisedale Tarn, caught the first glimpse of that conception which was"
19168,NOTE E,afterwards expanded into the beautiful picture given of Mr. Gough in _The
