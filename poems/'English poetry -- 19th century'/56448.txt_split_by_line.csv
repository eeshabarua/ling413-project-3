74,PREFACE,
75,PREFACE,The words of the Ode as here given differ slightly from those which
76,PREFACE,"appeared with Dr. Parry’s Cantata, sung at the Leeds Festival and at the"
77,PREFACE,Purcell Commemoration in London last year.
78,PREFACE,
79,PREFACE,"Since the poem was never perfected as a musical ode,--and I was not in"
80,PREFACE,"every particular responsible for it,--I have tried to make it more"
81,PREFACE,"presentable to readers, and in so doing have disregarded somewhat its"
82,PREFACE,"original intention. But it must still ask indulgence, because it still"
83,PREFACE,betrays the liberties and restrictions which seemed to me proper in an
84,PREFACE,attempt to meet the requirements of modern music.
85,PREFACE,
86,PREFACE,"It is a current idea that, by adopting a sort of declamatory treatment,"
87,PREFACE,it is possible to give to almost any poem a satisfactory musical
88,PREFACE,setting;[1] whence it would follow that a non-literary form is a
89,PREFACE,needless extravagance. From this general condemnation I wish to defend
90,PREFACE,"my poem, or rather my judgment, for I do not intend to discuss or defend"
91,PREFACE,"my poem in detail, nor to try to explain what I hoped to accomplish when"
92,PREFACE,I engaged in the work; it is still further from my intention that
93,PREFACE,anything which I shall say should be taken as applying to the music with
94,PREFACE,"which my ode was, far beyond its deserts, honored and beautified. But I"
95,PREFACE,"am concerned in combating the general proposition that modern music, by"
96,PREFACE,"virtue of a declamatory method, is able satisfactorily to interpret"
97,PREFACE,almost any kind of good poetry.
98,PREFACE,
99,PREFACE,"Such questions are generally left to the musician, and it should not be"
100,PREFACE,unwelcome to hear what may be said on the literary side. I shall
101,PREFACE,therefore state what appear to me to be impediments in the way of this
102,PREFACE,"announced happy marriage of music and poetry, and enumerate some of the"
103,PREFACE,"difficulties which, it seems to me, must especially beset the musician"
104,PREFACE,who would attempt to interpret pure literature by musical declamation.
105,PREFACE,
106,PREFACE,"First, the repetitions in music and poetry are incompatible. Though some"
107,PREFACE,"simple forms dependent on repetition are common to both, yet the general"
108,PREFACE,"laws are in the two arts contraries. In poetry repetition is avoided, in"
109,PREFACE,music it is looked for. A musical phrase has its force and significance
110,PREFACE,"increased by repetition, and is often in danger of losing its"
111,PREFACE,significance unless it be repeated; whereas such a repetition in poetry
112,PREFACE,is likely to endanger the whole effect of the original statement. And
113,PREFACE,"when reiterations that can be compared occur in both, then the second"
114,PREFACE,"occurrence will in music be generally the strongest, but in poetry the"
115,PREFACE,weakest; and the intensity of the repetitions goes on decreasing in
116,PREFACE,"music, and increasing for some time in poetry, till both become"
117,PREFACE,intolerable.
118,PREFACE,
119,PREFACE,"Secondly, the difficulty which this difference occasions is much"
120,PREFACE,increased by the method of declamatory exposition. Musical declamation
121,PREFACE,"must mean that the musical phrase is not chosen, as the earlier"
122,PREFACE,"musicians might have chosen or invented it, chiefly for the sake of its"
123,PREFACE,"own musical beauty, in correspondence with the _mood_[2] of the words,"
124,PREFACE,"and merely fitting the syllables, but that it is invented also to follow"
125,PREFACE,the verbal phrase in correspondence with some notion of rhetorical
126,PREFACE,"utterance, or natural inflection of speech enforcing the sense, and in"
127,PREFACE,so far with lesser regard to its own purely musical value. Such a
128,PREFACE,"musical phrase will therefore, in proportion to its success, be more"
129,PREFACE,"closely associated with the words, and cannot well be repeated unless"
130,PREFACE,"the words are repeated, which the declamation forbids."
131,PREFACE,
132,PREFACE,"Thirdly, when a declamatory musical movement is once started, the"
133,PREFACE,musician has very few means of bringing it to a conclusion. There is the
134,PREFACE,"method of repetition, which does not suit the Ode,[3] and which on his"
135,PREFACE,own theory he is almost forbidden to use; and there is the method of
136,PREFACE,"rising to a climax, which is perhaps the most usual device: but few"
137,PREFACE,"poems can offer occasion for the recurrence of climax, and its"
138,PREFACE,"employment would break up an ode into artificial sections, which the"
139,PREFACE,poet must repudiate. In pure music the musician has invented many
140,PREFACE,"beautiful devices, but in choral music he has not yet shown, so far as I"
141,PREFACE,"know, any power to match the poet’s liberty in this respect, whose"
142,PREFACE,"resources are as various as numerous, and are comparable to the freedom"
143,PREFACE,"and caprices of a dancer, who can at any moment surprise by a gesture,"
144,PREFACE,and be still.
145,PREFACE,
146,PREFACE,"Fourthly, the very rhythms of poetry and choral music are different in"
147,PREFACE,"kind. The rhythms and balances of verse are unbarred, the rhythms of"
148,PREFACE,choral music are barred. Even the universally recognized fitness of the
149,PREFACE,interpretation of a common measure in verse by the corresponding common
150,PREFACE,measure in music depends much more on the power and satisfying
151,PREFACE,completeness of the musical form in itself than on any right relation
152,PREFACE,which obtains between words and music under these conditions. Where the
153,PREFACE,"poetry has a more elaborated rhythm there are two extremes, between"
154,PREFACE,"which the musician’s manner of setting must lie. One extreme, the"
155,PREFACE,"musical, is that he should disregard the poetic rhythm for the sake of"
156,PREFACE,"new musical ideas, which must of course add beauty and not do violence"
157,PREFACE,to the words: the other is that he should follow the elaborate poetic
158,PREFACE,rhythm as nearly as possible. The method of declamation takes this
159,PREFACE,"latter extreme; it forbids musical independence, and prefers to identify"
160,PREFACE,"itself with the poetic rhythm, which in good poetry represents an ideal"
161,PREFACE,cadence of speech: but this interpretation is really a convention and a
162,PREFACE,"make-believe, and at best only an ingenious translation; and though it"
163,PREFACE,"may often be desirable, and the occasion of true musical beauty, yet its"
164,PREFACE,exclusive use is an abnegation of musical spontaneity for the sake of a
165,PREFACE,"secondary, mediate form, conspicuously dependent on something"
166,PREFACE,"extraneous, and giving prominence to ingenuity rather than to pure"
167,PREFACE,"æsthetic beauty, so as to provoke criticism rather than unquestioning"
168,PREFACE,delight.
169,PREFACE,
170,PREFACE,"Fifthly, the most beautiful effects in poetry are obtained by"
171,PREFACE,suggestion. A certain disposition of ideas in words produces a whole
172,PREFACE,result quite out of proportion to the parts; and if it is asked what
173,PREFACE,"music can do best, it is something in this same way of indefinite"
174,PREFACE,"suggestion. Poetry is here the stronger, in that its suggestion is more"
175,PREFACE,definitely directed; Music is the stronger in the greater force of the
176,PREFACE,"emotion raised. It would seem, therefore, that music could have no more"
177,PREFACE,fit and congenial task than to heighten the emotion of some great poetic
178,PREFACE,"beauty, the direction of which is supplied by the words. But if it seeks"
179,PREFACE,"to do this by a method of declamation, it makes this double mistake."
180,PREFACE,"First it tries to enforce the poetic means, which it may be assumed are"
181,PREFACE,"already on full strain, and in exact balance, and will not bear the"
182,PREFACE,"least disturbance; and secondly, it renounces its own highest power of"
183,PREFACE,"stirring emotion, because that resides in pure musical beauty, and is"
184,PREFACE,dependent on its mysterious quality: for one may say that its power is
185,PREFACE,"in proportion to its remoteness from common direct understanding, and"
186,PREFACE,that just so far as its sounds are understood to mean something definite
187,PREFACE,they lose their highest emotional power. It would follow from this that
188,PREFACE,the best musical treatment of passages of great poetic beauty is not to
189,PREFACE,"declaim them, but, as it were, to woo them and court them and caress"
190,PREFACE,"them, and deck them with fresh musical beauties, approaching them"
191,PREFACE,"tenderly now on one side, now on another, and to keep a delicate"
192,PREFACE,reserve which shall leave their proper unity unmolested.
193,PREFACE,
194,PREFACE,"Sixthly, if this is true of the highest poetic beauty, how will the"
195,PREFACE,declamatory method fare when it has to deal with the commonplaces and
196,PREFACE,bare or even ugly words which are the weaknesses and unkindnesses of
197,PREFACE,language? Just when the poet must deplore that his material is not more
198,PREFACE,"musical, it cannot be the musician’s triumph to insist on the defect."
199,PREFACE,The ordinary monosyllabic exclamations are a sufficient example; there
200,PREFACE,is absolutely no declamatory rendering of these which is at all worthy
201,PREFACE,of the emotion which they must often be employed to convey. What can be
202,PREFACE,made of them by a purely musical treatment is seen in the long-drawn
203,PREFACE,melodious sighs with which Carissimi or Purcell interpreted the Ohs and
204,PREFACE,Ahs.
205,PREFACE,
206,PREFACE,"Seventhly, this leads to the more general remark that the inflections of"
207,PREFACE,"all speech are much more limited in character, number, and scope than"
208,PREFACE,those of the trained singing voice. Whence it comes that the imitations
209,PREFACE,of speech in declamatory music have a tendency to fall into a
210,PREFACE,"comparatively small number of forms, which, even when most skilfully"
211,PREFACE,"disguised, are easily recognized by an attentive ear, and soon weary"
212,PREFACE,with their sameness. The basis of declamatory music is in fact no
213,PREFACE,"broader than that of the old _recitativo secco_, and it would seem"
214,PREFACE,unreasonable to hope that any ingenuity in the superstructure can long
215,PREFACE,"disguise this, or save itself ultimately from the same condemnation."
216,PREFACE,
217,PREFACE,"Eighthly, in consideration of the commonest difficulties which arise in"
218,PREFACE,"setting to music words which have not been specially contrived for it,"
219,PREFACE,"it appears that, compared with a more purely musical way, the"
220,PREFACE,declamatory method is absolutely at a disadvantage. It can do nothing
221,PREFACE,"with parentheses or dependent clauses. The weak polysyllables, which"
222,PREFACE,"have fit place in the diction and rhythm of verse, may be helped out by"
223,PREFACE,convention or by pure musical distraction; but declamation can only make
224,PREFACE,"them ugly. And as those for their weakness of sound, so other words"
225,PREFACE,"unable for their sense to bear the stress of singing,--such as"
226,PREFACE,"metaphorical words of slight meaning, which in poetry contribute but a"
227,PREFACE,"part of themselves to the main idea,--these declamation would make"
228,PREFACE,"ridiculous. Nor, on the other hand, with the words and phrases which are"
229,PREFACE,generally held most suitable for music is the declamatory method any
230,PREFACE,richer or happier: these are the well-sounding words of broad meaning
231,PREFACE,"and their common collocations, which require a fresh imagination to"
232,PREFACE,"revivify them. But the musician was always at his ease with these words,"
233,PREFACE,because his music was free to adorn them with any quantity of
234,PREFACE,enrichment; and this commanded the attention the more completely when
235,PREFACE,"the words required none. Now, if they are to be declaimed, they must"
236,PREFACE,return to their old prosaic nakedness; and since the attention is to be
237,PREFACE,"called to them, they will be even worse off than ever."
238,PREFACE,
239,PREFACE,The above remarks are sufficient for my purpose; but so many negations
240,PREFACE,may provoke the reader to look for some positive indication of the
241,PREFACE,"writer’s opinion as to what sort of words are best suited for music, and"
242,PREFACE,what sort of setting they should have. This question is far too wide to
243,PREFACE,be treated summarily; and if it has not been given to me to assist in
244,PREFACE,"solving it practically, I cannot venture to meddle with it further. I"
245,PREFACE,"had hoped, as a matter of fact, to contrive something; but it seems to"
246,PREFACE,me that the musician’s difficulty in advancing towards a solution is
247,PREFACE,much increased by the necessity of pleasing large audiences. It is
248,PREFACE,certain that the final appeal is not to the first hearing of any large
249,PREFACE,audience in this country. What sort of music is really in request may be
250,PREFACE,judged from the repertories of our military bands and the programmes of
251,PREFACE,the Royal concerts. Even the highest class concerts I have seen
252,PREFACE,"interlarded with unworthy items, which were rapturously received by the"
253,PREFACE,fashionable hearers who did not recognize the trap.
254,PREFACE,
255,PREFACE,“The man that hath no music in himself
256,PREFACE,"Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;”"
257,PREFACE,
258,PREFACE,and these were the stratagems to obtain his spoils.
259,PREFACE,
260,PREFACE,It is possible enough that an audience may enjoy having commonplaces
261,PREFACE,vociferated at them with orchestral accompaniment; but this is nothing.
262,PREFACE,To the musician the poet will say that he is surprised to find a term
263,PREFACE,which is considered a reproach in poetry esteemed as the expression of
264,PREFACE,the best means of its interpretation. To call a poem declamatory or
265,PREFACE,rhetorical is to condemn it; and music is naturally less rhetorical than
266,PREFACE,speech; so that in a declamatory interpretation of poetry Music would
267,PREFACE,seem to abnegate its own excellence for the sake of a quality foreign to
268,PREFACE,itself and repudiated by the art which it is seeking to heighten.
269,PREFACE,
270,PREFACE,He will not be satisfied by the assurance that the method will serve to
271,PREFACE,introduce and explain poetry to some people who are generally
272,PREFACE,indifferent to it; it will seem to him that the musician is laboring to
273,PREFACE,"introduce into pure vocal music the old dramatic crux,--that awkwardness"
274,PREFACE,"from which it has, in its best forms, been beautifully free. Because in"
275,PREFACE,"the musical drama that must be sung which should be spoken, why try to"
276,PREFACE,make that seem to be spoken which should be sung?

283,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
284,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,This analysis is taken from the concert programme:--
285,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
286,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,"I. An invitation to Music to return to England: that is, in the sense"
287,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,that England should be again pre-eminent for music above other European
288,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,"nations, as she was in the sixteenth century. The three English graces"
289,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,"are Liberty, Poetry, and Music."
290,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
291,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,II. Music invited in the name of Liberty: the idea associated with the
292,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,forest.
293,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
294,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,III. Music invited in the name of Poetry: the idea of Poetry associated
295,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,with pastoral scenes and husbandry.
296,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
297,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,"IV. The Sea introduced as the type of Love; isolating our patriotism,"
298,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,and making our bond with the rest of the world.
299,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
300,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,V. The national intention gives way to wider human sympathies. Music
301,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,"here considered as the voice of Universal Love, calling and responding"
302,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,"throughout the world. A national meaning also underlies, in respect of"
303,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,our world-wide colonization.
304,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
305,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,VI. Sorrow now invites Music; asserting her need to be the chiefest. The
306,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,"occasion being the celebration of Purcell’s genius, her complaint"
307,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,implies a call for some musical lament for his untimely death.
308,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
309,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,VII. Music replies with a DIRGE for the dead artist; offering no
310,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,consolation beyond the expression of woe.
311,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
312,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,"VIII. The chorus consoled, praise dead artists, and pronounce them happy"
313,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,and immortal.
314,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,
315,ANALYSIS OF ODE.,IX. A picture of the ideal world of delight created by Art.
