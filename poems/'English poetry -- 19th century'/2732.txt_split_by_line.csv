143,THE CHRONICLE OF THE DRUM.,THE CHRONICLE OF THE DRUM.
144,THE CHRONICLE OF THE DRUM.,
145,PART I.,PART I.
146,PART I.,
147,PART I.,
148,PART I.,"At Paris, hard by the Maine barriers,"
149,PART I.,"Whoever will choose to repair,"
150,PART I.,Midst a dozen of wooden-legged warriors
151,PART I.,May haply fall in with old Pierre.
152,PART I.,On the sunshiny bench of a tavern
153,PART I.,"He sits and he prates of old wars,"
154,PART I.,And moistens his pipe of tobacco
155,PART I.,With a drink that is named after Mars.
156,PART I.,
157,PART I.,"The beer makes his tongue run the quicker,"
158,PART I.,"And as long as his tap never fails,"
159,PART I.,Thus over his favorite liquor
160,PART I.,Old Peter will tell his old tales.
161,PART I.,"Says he, ""In my life's ninety summers"
162,PART I.,"Strange changes and chances I've seen,--"
163,PART I.,So here's to all gentlemen drummers
164,PART I.,That ever have thump'd on a skin.
165,PART I.,
166,PART I.,"""Brought up in the art military"
167,PART I.,For four generations we are;
168,PART I.,"My ancestors drumm'd for King Harry,"
169,PART I.,The Huguenot lad of Navarre.
170,PART I.,And as each man in life has his station
171,PART I.,"According as Fortune may fix,"
172,PART I.,"While Condé was waving the baton,"
173,PART I.,My grandsire was trolling the sticks.
174,PART I.,
175,PART I.,"""Ah! those were the days for commanders!"
176,PART I.,"What glories my grandfather won,"
177,PART I.,"Ere bigots, and lackeys, and panders"
178,PART I.,The fortunes of France had undone!
179,PART I.,"In Germany, Flanders, and Holland,--"
180,PART I.,What foeman resisted us then?
181,PART I.,"No; my grandsire was ever victorious,"
182,PART I.,My grandsire and Monsieur Turenne.
183,PART I.,
184,PART I.,"""He died: and our noble battalions"
185,PART I.,The jade fickle Fortune forsook;
186,PART I.,"And at Blenheim, in spite of our valiance,"
187,PART I.,The victory lay with Malbrook.
188,PART I.,The news it was brought to King Louis;
189,PART I.,Corbleu! how his Majesty swore
190,PART I.,When he heard they had taken my grandsire:
191,PART I.,And twelve thousand gentlemen more.
192,PART I.,
193,PART I.,"""At Namur, Ramillies, and Malplaquet"
194,PART I.,"Were we posted, on plain or in trench:"
195,PART I.,Malbrook only need to attack it
196,PART I.,And away from him scamper'd we French.
197,PART I.,"Cheer up! 'tis no use to be glum, boys,--"
198,PART I.,"'Tis written, since fighting begun,"
199,PART I.,"That sometimes we fight and we conquer,"
200,PART I.,And sometimes we fight and we run.
201,PART I.,
202,PART I.,"""To fight and to run was our fate:"
203,PART I.,Our fortune and fame had departed.
204,PART I.,"And so perish'd Louis the Great,--"
205,PART I.,"Old, lonely, and half broken-hearted."
206,PART I.,"His coffin they pelted with mud,"
207,PART I.,His body they tried to lay hands on;
208,PART I.,And so having buried King Louis
209,PART I.,They loyally served his great-grandson.
210,PART I.,
211,PART I.,"""God save the beloved King Louis!"
212,PART I.,"(For so he was nicknamed by some,)"
213,PART I.,And now came my father to do his
214,PART I.,King's orders and beat on the drum.
215,PART I.,"My grandsire was dead, but his bones"
216,PART I.,"Must have shaken I'm certain for joy,"
217,PART I.,To hear daddy drumming the English
218,PART I.,From the meadows of famed Fontenoy.
219,PART I.,
220,PART I.,"""So well did he drum in that battle"
221,PART I.,That the enemy show'd us their backs;
222,PART I.,Corbleu! it was pleasant to rattle
223,PART I.,The sticks and to follow old Saxe!
224,PART I.,"We next had Soubise as a leader,"
225,PART I.,"And as luck hath its changes and fits,"
226,PART I.,"At Rossbach, in spite of dad's drumming,"
227,PART I.,'Tis said we were beaten by Fritz.
228,PART I.,
229,PART I.,"""And now daddy cross'd the Atlantic,"
230,PART I.,To drum for Montcalm and his men;
231,PART I.,Morbleu! but it makes a man frantic
232,PART I.,To think we were beaten again!
233,PART I.,"My daddy he cross'd the wide ocean,"
234,PART I.,"My mother brought me on her neck,"
235,PART I.,And we came in the year fifty-seven
236,PART I.,To guard the good town of Quebec.
237,PART I.,
238,PART I.,"""In the year fifty-nine came the Britons,--"
239,PART I.,"Full well I remember the day,--"
240,PART I.,"They knocked at our gates for admittance,"
241,PART I.,Their vessels were moor'd in our bay.
242,PART I.,"Says our general, 'Drive me yon redcoats"
243,PART I.,Away to the sea whence they come!'
244,PART I.,"So we marched against Wolfe and his bull-dogs,"
245,PART I.,We marched at the sound of the drum.
246,PART I.,
247,PART I.,"""I think I can see my poor mammy"
248,PART I.,"With me in her hand as she waits,"
249,PART I.,"And our regiment, slowly retreating,"
250,PART I.,Pours back through the citadel gates.
251,PART I.,"Dear mammy she looks in their faces,"
252,PART I.,And asks if her husband is come?
253,PART I.,"--He is lying all cold on the glacis,"
254,PART I.,And will never more beat on the drum.
255,PART I.,
256,PART I.,"""Come, drink, 'tis no use to be glum, boys,"
257,PART I.,He died like a soldier in glory;
258,PART I.,"Here's a glass to the health of all drum-boys,"
259,PART I.,And now I'll commence my own story.
260,PART I.,"Once more did we cross the salt ocean,"
261,PART I.,We came in the year eighty-one;
262,PART I.,And the wrongs of my father the drummer
263,PART I.,Were avenged by the drummer his son.
264,PART I.,
265,PART I.,"""In Chesapeake Bay we were landed."
266,PART I.,In vain strove the British to pass:
267,PART I.,"Rochambeau our armies commanded,"
268,PART I.,Our ships they were led by De Grasse.
269,PART I.,Morbleu! How I rattled the drumsticks
270,PART I.,The day we march'd into Yorktown;
271,PART I.,Ten thousand of beef-eating British
272,PART I.,Their weapons we caused to lay down.
273,PART I.,
274,PART I.,"""Then homewards returning victorious,"
275,PART I.,"In peace to our country we came,"
276,PART I.,And were thanked for our glorious actions
277,PART I.,By Louis Sixteenth of the name.
278,PART I.,What drummer on earth could be prouder
279,PART I.,"Than I, while I drumm'd at Versailles"
280,PART I.,"To the lovely court ladies in powder,"
281,PART I.,"And lappets, and long satin-tails?"
282,PART I.,
283,PART I.,"""The Princes that day pass'd before us,"
284,PART I.,Our countrymen's glory and hope;
285,PART I.,"Monsieur, who was learned in Horace,"
286,PART I.,"D'Artois, who could dance the tightrope."
287,PART I.,One night we kept guard for the Queen
288,PART I.,"At her Majesty's opera-box,"
289,PART I.,"While the King, that majestical monarch,"
290,PART I.,Sat filing at home at his locks.
291,PART I.,
292,PART I.,"""Yes, I drumm'd for the fair Antoinette,"
293,PART I.,"And so smiling she look'd and so tender,"
294,PART I.,"That our officers, privates, and drummers,"
295,PART I.,All vow'd they would die to defend her.
296,PART I.,"But she cared not for us honest fellows,"
297,PART I.,"Who fought and who bled in her wars,"
298,PART I.,"She sneer'd at our gallant Rochambeau,"
299,PART I.,And turned Lafayette out of doors.
300,PART I.,
301,PART I.,"""Ventrebleu! then I swore a great oath,"
302,PART I.,No more to such tyrants to kneel.
303,PART I.,"And so just to keep up my drumming,"
304,PART I.,One day I drumm'd down the Bastille.
305,PART I.,"Ho, landlord! a stoup of fresh wine."
306,PART I.,"Come, comrades, a bumper we'll try,"
307,PART I.,And drink to the year eighty-nine
308,PART I.,And the glorious fourth of July!
309,PART I.,
310,PART I.,"""Then bravely our cannon it thunder'd"
311,PART I.,As onwards our patriots bore.
312,PART I.,"Our enemies were but a hundred,"
313,PART I.,And we twenty thousand or more.
314,PART I.,They carried the news to King Louis.
315,PART I.,"He heard it as calm as you please,"
316,PART I.,"And, like a majestical monarch,"
317,PART I.,Kept filing his locks and his keys.
318,PART I.,
319,PART I.,"""We show'd our republican courage,"
320,PART I.,"We storm'd and we broke the great gate in,"
321,PART I.,And we murder'd the insolent governor
322,PART I.,For daring to keep us a-waiting.
323,PART I.,Lambesc and his squadrons stood by:
324,PART I.,They never stirr'd finger or thumb.
325,PART I.,The saucy aristocrats trembled
326,PART I.,As they heard the republican drum.
327,PART I.,
328,PART I.,"""Hurrah! what a storm was a-brewing:"
329,PART I.,The day of our vengeance was come!
330,PART I.,Through scenes of what carnage and ruin
331,PART I.,Did I beat on the patriot drum!
332,PART I.,Let's drink to the famed tenth of August:
333,PART I.,"At midnight I beat the tattoo,"
334,PART I.,And woke up the Pikemen of Paris
335,PART I.,To follow the bold Barbaroux.
336,PART I.,
337,PART I.,"""With pikes, and with shouts, and with torches"
338,PART I.,"March'd onwards our dusty battalions,"
339,PART I.,"And we girt the tall castle of Louis,"
340,PART I.,A million of tatterdemalions!
341,PART I.,We storm'd the fair gardens where tower'd
342,PART I.,The walls of his heritage splendid.
343,PART I.,"Ah, shame on him, craven and coward,"
344,PART I.,That had not the heart to defend it!
345,PART I.,
346,PART I.,"""With the crown of his sires on his head,"
347,PART I.,"His nobles and knights by his side,"
348,PART I.,At the foot of his ancestors' palace
349,PART I.,"'Twere easy, methinks, to have died."
350,PART I.,"But no: when we burst through his barriers,"
351,PART I.,"Mid heaps of the dying and dead,"
352,PART I.,In vain through the chambers we sought him--
353,PART I.,He had turn'd like a craven and fled.
354,PART I.,
355,PART I.,.       .       .       .       .
356,PART I.,
357,PART I.,"""You all know the Place de la Concorde?"
358,PART I.,'Tis hard by the Tuilerie wall.
359,PART I.,"Mid terraces, fountains, and statues,"
360,PART I.,There rises an obelisk tall.
361,PART I.,"There rises an obelisk tall,"
362,PART I.,All garnish'd and gilded the base is:
363,PART I.,'Tis surely the gayest of all
364,PART I.,Our beautiful city's gay places.
365,PART I.,
366,PART I.,"""Around it are gardens and flowers,"
367,PART I.,"And the Cities of France on their thrones,"
368,PART I.,Each crown'd with his circlet of flowers
369,PART I.,Sits watching this biggest of stones!
370,PART I.,"I love to go sit in the sun there,"
371,PART I.,"The flowers and fountains to see,"
372,PART I.,And to think of the deeds that were done there
373,PART I.,In the glorious year ninety-three.
374,PART I.,
375,PART I.,"""'Twas here stood the Altar of Freedom;"
376,PART I.,And though neither marble nor gilding
377,PART I.,Was used in those days to adorn
378,PART I.,"Our simple republican building,"
379,PART I.,Corbleu! but the MERE GUILLOTINE
380,PART I.,"Cared little for splendor or show,"
381,PART I.,"So you gave her an axe and a beam,"
382,PART I.,And a plank and a basket or so.
383,PART I.,
384,PART I.,"""Awful, and proud, and erect,"
385,PART I.,Here sat our republican goddess.
386,PART I.,Each morning her table we deck'd
387,PART I.,With dainty aristocrats' bodies.
388,PART I.,The people each day flocked around
389,PART I.,As she sat at her meat and her wine:
390,PART I.,'Twas always the use of our nation
391,PART I.,To witness the sovereign dine.
392,PART I.,
393,PART I.,"""Young virgins with fair golden tresses,"
394,PART I.,"Old silver-hair'd prelates and priests,"
395,PART I.,"Dukes, marquises, barons, princesses,"
396,PART I.,Were splendidly served at her feasts.
397,PART I.,Ventrebleu! but we pamper'd our ogress
398,PART I.,"With the best that our nation could bring,"
399,PART I.,"And dainty she grew in her progress,"
400,PART I.,And called for the head of a King!
401,PART I.,
402,PART I.,"""She called for the blood of our King,"
403,PART I.,And straight from his prison we drew him;
404,PART I.,"And to her with shouting we led him,"
405,PART I.,"And took him, and bound him, and slew him."
406,PART I.,'The monarchs of Europe against me
407,PART I.,Have plotted a godless alliance
408,PART I.,"I'll fling them the head of King Louis,'"
409,PART I.,"She said, 'as my gage of defiance.'"
410,PART I.,
411,PART I.,"""I see him as now, for a moment,"
412,PART I.,Away from his jailers he broke;
413,PART I.,"And stood at the foot of the scaffold,"
414,PART I.,"And linger'd, and fain would have spoke."
415,PART I.,"'Ho,drummer! quick! silence yon Capet,'"
416,PART I.,"Says Santerre, 'with a beat of your drum.'"
417,PART I.,"Lustily then did I tap it,"
418,PART I.,"And the son of Saint Louis was dumb."""
419,PART I.,
420,PART I.,
421,PART II.,PART II.
422,PART II.,
423,PART II.,
424,PART II.,"""The glorious days of September"
425,PART II.,Saw many aristocrats fall;
426,PART II.,'Twas then that our pikes drunk the blood
427,PART II.,In the beautiful breast of Lamballe.
428,PART II.,"Pardi, 'twas a beautiful lady!"
429,PART II.,I seldom have looked on her like;
430,PART II.,"And I drumm'd for a gallant procession,"
431,PART II.,That marched with her head on a pike.
432,PART II.,
433,PART II.,"""Let's show the pale head to the Queen,"
434,PART II.,We said--she'll remember it well.
435,PART II.,"She looked from the bars of her prison,"
436,PART II.,"And shriek'd as she saw it, and fell."
437,PART II.,"We set up a shout at her screaming,"
438,PART II.,We laugh'd at the fright she had shown
439,PART II.,At the sight of the head of her minion;
440,PART II.,How she'd tremble to part with her own.
441,PART II.,
442,PART II.,"""We had taken the head of King Capet,"
443,PART II.,We called for the blood of his wife;
444,PART II.,"Undaunted she came to the scaffold,"
445,PART II.,And bared her fair neck to the knife.
446,PART II.,"As she felt the foul fingers that touch'd her,"
447,PART II.,"She shrunk, but she deigned not to speak:"
448,PART II.,"She look'd with a royal disdain,"
449,PART II.,And died with a blush on her cheek!
450,PART II.,
451,PART II.,"""'Twas thus that our country was saved;"
452,PART II.,So told us the safety committee!
453,PART II.,"But psha! I've the heart of a soldier,"
454,PART II.,"All gentleness, mercy, and pity."
455,PART II.,"I loathed to assist at such deeds,"
456,PART II.,And my drum beat its loudest of tunes
457,PART II.,As we offered to justice offended
458,PART II.,The blood of the bloody tribunes.
459,PART II.,
460,PART II.,"""Away with such foul recollections!"
461,PART II.,No more of the axe and the block;
462,PART II.,"I saw the last fight of the sections,"
463,PART II.,As they fell 'neath our guns at Saint Rock.
464,PART II.,Young BONAPARTE led us that day;
465,PART II.,"When he sought the Italian frontier,"
466,PART II.,"I follow'd my gallant young captain,"
467,PART II.,I follow'd him many a long year.
468,PART II.,
469,PART II.,"""We came to an army in rags,"
470,PART II.,Our general was but a boy
471,PART II.,When we first saw the Austrian flags
472,PART II.,Flaunt proud in the fields of Savoy.
473,PART II.,"In the glorious year ninety-six,"
474,PART II.,We march'd to the banks of the Po;
475,PART II.,"I carried my drum and my sticks,"
476,PART II.,And we laid the proud Austrian low.
477,PART II.,
478,PART II.,"""In triumph we enter'd Milan,"
479,PART II.,We seized on the Mantuan keys;
480,PART II.,"The troops of the Emperor ran,"
481,PART II.,And the Pope he tell down on his knees.--
482,PART II.,"Pierre's comrades here call'd a fresh bottle,"
483,PART II.,"And clubbing together their wealth,"
484,PART II.,"They drank to the Army of Italy,"
485,PART II.,"And General Bonaparte's health."""
486,PART II.,
487,PART II.,"The drummer now bared his old breast,"
488,PART II.,"And show'd us a plenty of scars,"
489,PART II.,"Rude presents that Fortune had made him,"
490,PART II.,In fifty victorious wars.
491,PART II.,"""This came when I follow'd bold Kleber--"
492,PART II.,'Twas shot by a Mameluke gun;
493,PART II.,"And this from an Austrian sabre,"
494,PART II.,When the field of Marengo was won.
495,PART II.,
496,PART II.,"""My forehead has many deep furrows,"
497,PART II.,But this is the deepest of all:
498,PART II.,"A Brunswicker made it at Jena,"
499,PART II.,Beside the fair river of Saal.
500,PART II.,"This cross, 'twas the Emperor gave it;"
501,PART II.,(God bless him!) it covers a blow;
502,PART II.,"I had it at Austerlitz fight,"
503,PART II.,As I beat on my drum in the snow.
504,PART II.,
505,PART II.,"""'Twas thus that we conquer'd and fought;"
506,PART II.,But wherefore continue the story?
507,PART II.,There's never a baby in France
508,PART II.,"But has heard of our chief and our glory,--"
509,PART II.,"But has heard of our chief and our fame,"
510,PART II.,"His sorrows and triumphs can tell,"
511,PART II.,"How bravely Napoleon conquer'd,"
512,PART II.,How bravely and sadly he fell.
513,PART II.,
514,PART II.,"""It makes my old heart to beat higher,"
515,PART II.,To think of the deeds that I saw;
516,PART II.,"I follow'd bold Ney through the fire,"
517,PART II.,"And charged at the side of Murat."""
518,PART II.,And so did old Peter continue
519,PART II.,His story of twenty brave years;
520,PART II.,His audience follow'd with comments--
521,PART II.,Rude comments of curses and tears.
522,PART II.,
523,PART II.,He told how the Prussians in vain
524,PART II.,Had died in defence of their land;
525,PART II.,"His audience laugh'd at the story,"
526,PART II.,And vow'd that their captain was grand!
527,PART II.,"He had fought the red English, he said,"
528,PART II.,In many a battle of Spain;
529,PART II.,"They cursed the red English, and prayed"
530,PART II.,To meet them and fight them again.
531,PART II.,
532,PART II.,"He told them how Russia was lost,"
533,PART II.,Had winter not driven them back;
534,PART II.,"And his company cursed the quick frost,"
535,PART II.,And doubly they cursed the Cossack.
536,PART II.,He told how the stranger arrived;
537,PART II.,They wept at the tale of disgrace:
538,PART II.,"And they long'd but for one battle more,"
539,PART II.,The stain of their shame to efface!
540,PART II.,
541,PART II.,"""Our country their hordes overrun,"
542,PART II.,"We fled to the fields of Champagne,"
543,PART II.,"And fought them, though twenty to one,"
544,PART II.,And beat them again and again!
545,PART II.,Our warrior was conquer'd at last;
546,PART II.,They bade him his crown to resign;
547,PART II.,To fate and his country he yielded
548,PART II.,The rights of himself and his line.
549,PART II.,
550,PART II.,"""He came, and among us he stood,"
551,PART II.,Around him we press'd in a throng:
552,PART II.,"We could not regard him for weeping,"
553,PART II.,Who had led us and loved us so long.
554,PART II.,"'I have led you for twenty long years,'"
555,PART II.,"Napoleon said, ere he went"
556,PART II.,"'Wherever was honor I found you,"
557,PART II.,"And with you, my sons, am content!"
558,PART II.,
559,PART II.,"""'Though Europe against me was arm'd,"
560,PART II.,Your chiefs and my people are true;
561,PART II.,"I still might have struggled with fortune,"
562,PART II.,And baffled all Europe with you.
563,PART II.,
564,PART II.,"""'But France would have suffer'd the while,"
565,PART II.,'Tis best that I suffer alone;
566,PART II.,"I go to my place of exile,"
567,PART II.,To write of the deeds we have done.
568,PART II.,
569,PART II.,"""'Be true to the king that they give you,"
570,PART II.,We may not embrace ere we part;
571,PART II.,"But, General, reach me your hand,"
572,PART II.,"And press me, I pray, to your heart.'"
573,PART II.,
574,PART II.,"""He called for our battle standard;"
575,PART II.,One kiss to the eagle he gave.
576,PART II.,"'Dear eagle!' he said, 'may this kiss"
577,PART II.,Long sound in the hearts of the brave!'
578,PART II.,'Twas thus that Napoleon left us;
579,PART II.,"Our people were weeping and mute,"
580,PART II.,"As he pass'd through the lines of his guard,"
581,PART II.,And our drums beat the notes of salute.
582,PART II.,
583,PART II.,.       .       .       .       .
584,PART II.,
585,PART II.,"""I look'd when the drumming was o'er,"
586,PART II.,"I look'd, but our hero was gone;"
587,PART II.,"We were destined to see him once more,"
588,PART II.,When we fought on the Mount of St. John.
589,PART II.,The Emperor rode through our files;
590,PART II.,"'Twas June, and a fair Sunday morn;"
591,PART II.,The lines of our warriors for miles
592,PART II.,Stretch'd wide through the Waterloo corn.
593,PART II.,
594,PART II.,"""In thousands we stood on the plain,"
595,PART II.,The red-coats were crowning the height;
596,PART II.,"'Go scatter yon English,' he said;"
597,PART II.,"'We'll sup, lads, at Brussels tonight.'"
598,PART II.,We answered his voice with a shout;
599,PART II.,Our eagles were bright in the sun;
600,PART II.,"Our drums and our cannon spoke out,"
601,PART II.,And the thundering battle begun.
602,PART II.,
603,PART II.,"""One charge to another succeeds,"
604,PART II.,Like waves that a hurricane bears;
605,PART II.,All day do our galloping steeds
606,PART II.,Dash fierce on the enemy's squares.
607,PART II.,At noon we began the fell onset:
608,PART II.,We charged up the Englishman's hill;
609,PART II.,And madly we charged it at sunset--
610,PART II.,His banners were floating there still.
611,PART II.,
612,PART II.,"""--Go to! I will tell you no more;"
613,PART II.,You know how the battle was lost.
614,PART II.,"Ho! fetch me a beaker of wine,"
615,PART II.,"And, comrades, I'll give you a toast."
616,PART II.,"I'll give you a curse on all traitors,"
617,PART II.,Who plotted our Emperor's ruin;
618,PART II.,"And a curse on those red-coated English,"
619,PART II.,Whose bayonets help'd our undoing.
620,PART II.,
621,PART II.,"""A curse on those British assassins,"
622,PART II.,Who order'd the slaughter of Ney;
623,PART II.,"A curse on Sir Hudson, who tortured"
624,PART II.,The life of our hero away.
625,PART II.,A curse on all Russians--I hate them--
626,PART II.,On all Prussian and Austrian fry;
627,PART II.,"And oh! but I pray we may meet them,"
628,PART II.,"And fight them again ere I die."""
629,PART II.,
630,PART II.,'Twas thus old Peter did conclude
631,PART II.,His chronicle with curses fit.
632,PART II.,"He spoke the tale in accents rude,"
633,PART II.,In ruder verse I copied it.
634,PART II.,
635,PART II.,"Perhaps the tale a moral bears,"
636,PART II.,"(All tales in time to this must come,)"
637,PART II.,The story of two hundred years
638,PART II.,Writ on the parchment of a drum.
639,PART II.,
640,PART II.,"What Peter told with drum and stick,"
641,PART II.,Is endless theme for poet's pen:
642,PART II.,"Is found in endless quartos thick,"
643,PART II.,Enormous books by learned men.
644,PART II.,
645,PART II.,"And ever since historian writ,"
646,PART II.,"And ever since a bard could sing,"

648,PART II.,The noble art of murdering.
649,PART II.,
650,PART II.,"We love to read the glorious page,"
651,PART II.,How bold Achilles kill'd his foe:
652,PART II.,"And Turnus, fell'd by Trojans' rage,"
653,PART II.,Went howling to the shades below.
654,PART II.,
655,PART II.,"How Godfrey led his red-cross knights,"
656,PART II.,How mad Orlando slash'd and slew;
657,PART II.,There's not a single bard that writes
658,PART II.,But doth the glorious theme renew.
659,PART II.,
660,PART II.,"And while, in fashion picturesque,"
661,PART II.,"The poet rhymes of blood and blows,"
662,PART II.,The grave historian at his desk
663,PART II.,Describes the same in classic prose.
664,PART II.,
665,PART II.,"Go read the works of Reverend Cox,"
666,PART II.,You'll duly see recorded there
667,PART II.,The history of the self-same knocks
668,PART II.,Here roughly sung by Drummer Pierre.
669,PART II.,
670,PART II.,"Of battles fierce and warriors big,"
671,PART II.,"He writes in phrases dull and slow,"
672,PART II.,"And waves his cauliflower wig,"
673,PART II.,"And shouts ""Saint George for Marlborow!"""
674,PART II.,
675,PART II.,"Take Doctor Southey from the shelf,"
676,PART II.,An LL. D.--a peaceful man;

678,PART II.,Because we beat the Corsican!
679,PART II.,
680,PART II.,From first to last his page is filled
681,PART II.,With stirring tales how blows were struck.

683,PART II.,And praises God for our good luck.
684,PART II.,
685,PART II.,"Some hints, 'tis true, of politics"
686,PART II.,The doctors give and statesman's art:
687,PART II.,"Pierre only bangs his drum and sticks,"
688,PART II.,And understands the bloody part.
689,PART II.,
690,PART II.,"He cares not what the cause may be,"
691,PART II.,He is not nice for wrong and right;
692,PART II.,"But show him where's the enemy,"
693,PART II.,He only asks to drum and fight.
694,PART II.,
695,PART II.,"They bid him fight,--perhaps he wins."
696,PART II.,"And when he tells the story o'er,"
697,PART II.,"The honest savage brags and grins,"
698,PART II.,And only longs to fight once more.
699,PART II.,
700,PART II.,"But luck may change, and valor fail,"
701,PART II.,"Our drummer, Peter, meet reverse,"
702,PART II.,And with a moral points his tale--
703,PART II.,The end of all such tales--a curse.
704,PART II.,
705,PART II.,"Last year, my love, it was my hap"
706,PART II.,"Behind a grenadier to be,"

719,PART II.,
720,PART II.,"He puts him there in foremost rank,"
721,PART II.,You wonder at his cap of hair:

724,PART II.,
725,PART II.,Go to! I hate him and his trade:
