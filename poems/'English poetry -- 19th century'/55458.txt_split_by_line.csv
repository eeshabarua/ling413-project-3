59,PREFACE.,PREFACE.
60,PREFACE.,
61,PREFACE.,"IN the religion of the Hindoos, which of all false religions is the"
62,PREFACE.,"most monstrous in its fables, and the most fatal in its effects, there"
63,PREFACE.,"is one remarkable peculiarity. Prayers, penances, and sacrifices, are"
64,PREFACE.,"supposed to possess an inherent and actual value, in no degree"
65,PREFACE.,depending upon the disposition or motive of the person who performs
66,PREFACE.,"them. They are drafts upon Heaven, for which the Gods cannot refuse"
67,PREFACE.,"payment. The worst men, bent upon the worst designs, have in this"
68,PREFACE.,manner obtained power which has made them formidable to the Supreme
69,PREFACE.,"Deities themselves, and rendered an _Avatar_, or Incarnation of"
70,PREFACE.,"Veeshnoo the Preserver, necessary. This belief is the foundation of"
71,PREFACE.,"the following Poem. The story is original; but, in all its parts,"
72,PREFACE.,consistent with the superstition upon which it is built; and however
73,PREFACE.,"startling the fictions may appear, they might almost be called"
74,PREFACE.,credible when compared with the genuine tales of Hindoo mythology.
75,PREFACE.,
76,PREFACE.,"No figures can be imagined more anti-picturesque, and less poetical,"
77,PREFACE.,than the mythological personages of the Bramins. This deformity was
78,PREFACE.,easily kept out of sight:--their hundred hands are but a clumsy
79,PREFACE.,personification of power; their numerous heads only a gross image of
80,PREFACE.,"divinity, ""whose countenance,"" as the Bhagvat-Geeta expresses it, ""is"
81,PREFACE.,"turned on every side."" To the other obvious objection, that the religion"
82,PREFACE.,of Hindostan is not generally known enough to supply fit machinery for
83,PREFACE.,"an English poem, I can only answer, that, if every allusion to it"
84,PREFACE.,throughout the work is not sufficiently self-explained to render the
85,PREFACE.,"passage intelligible, there is a want of skill in the poet. Even those"
86,PREFACE.,readers who should be wholly unacquainted with the writings of our
87,PREFACE.,"learned Orientalists, will find all the preliminary knowledge that can"
88,PREFACE.,"be needful, in the brief explanation of mythological names prefixed to"
89,PREFACE.,the Poem.

186,THE FUNERAL.,"Midnight, and yet no eye"
187,THE FUNERAL.,Through all the Imperial City clos'd in sleep!
188,THE FUNERAL.,Behold her streets a-blaze
189,THE FUNERAL.,"With light that seems to kindle the red sky,"
190,THE FUNERAL.,Her myriads swarming through the crowded ways!
191,THE FUNERAL.,"Master and slave, old age and infancy,"
192,THE FUNERAL.,"All, all abroad to gaze;"
193,THE FUNERAL.,House-top and balcony
194,THE FUNERAL.,"Clustered with women, who throw back their veils,"
195,THE FUNERAL.,With unimpeded and insatiate sight
196,THE FUNERAL.,"To view the funeral pomp which passes by,"
197,THE FUNERAL.,{2}
198,THE FUNERAL.,As if the mournful rite
199,THE FUNERAL.,Were but to them a scene of joyance and delight.
200,THE FUNERAL.,
201,THE FUNERAL.,2.
202,THE FUNERAL.,"Vainly, ye blessed twinklers of the night,"
203,THE FUNERAL.,"Your feeble beams ye shed,"
204,THE FUNERAL.,Quench'd in the unnatural light which might out-stare
205,THE FUNERAL.,Even the broad eye of day;
206,THE FUNERAL.,And thou from thy celestial way
207,THE FUNERAL.,"Pourest, O Moon, an ineffectual ray!"
208,THE FUNERAL.,For lo! ten thousand torches flame and flare
209,THE FUNERAL.,"Upon the midnight air,"
210,THE FUNERAL.,Blotting the lights of heaven
211,THE FUNERAL.,With one portentous glare.
212,THE FUNERAL.,"Behold the fragrant smoke in many a fold,"
213,THE FUNERAL.,"Ascending floats along the fiery sky,"
214,THE FUNERAL.,"And hangeth visible on high,"
215,THE FUNERAL.,A dark and waving canopy.
216,THE FUNERAL.,
217,THE FUNERAL.,3.
218,THE FUNERAL.,Hark! 'tis the funeral trumpet's breath!
219,THE FUNERAL.,'Tis the dirge of death!
220,THE FUNERAL.,"At once ten thousand drums begin,"
221,THE FUNERAL.,With one long thunder-peal the ear assailing;
222,THE FUNERAL.,{3}
223,THE FUNERAL.,"Ten thousand voices then join in,"
224,THE FUNERAL.,And with one deep and general din
225,THE FUNERAL.,Pour their wild wailing.
226,THE FUNERAL.,The song of praise is drown'd
227,THE FUNERAL.,Amid that deafening sound;
228,THE FUNERAL.,"You hear no more the trumpet's tone,"
229,THE FUNERAL.,"You hear no more the mourner's moan,"
230,THE FUNERAL.,"Though the trumpet's breath, and the dirge of death,"
231,THE FUNERAL.,Mingle and swell the funeral yell.
232,THE FUNERAL.,But rising over all in one acclaim
233,THE FUNERAL.,"Is heard the echoed and re-echoed name,"
234,THE FUNERAL.,From all that countless rout:
235,THE FUNERAL.,Arvalan! Arvalan!
236,THE FUNERAL.,Arvalan! Arvalan!
237,THE FUNERAL.,Ten times ten thousand voices in one shout
238,THE FUNERAL.,Call Arvalan! The overpowering sound
239,THE FUNERAL.,"From house to house repeated rings about,"
240,THE FUNERAL.,From tower to tower rolls round.
241,THE FUNERAL.,
242,THE FUNERAL.,4.
243,THE FUNERAL.,The death-procession moves along;
244,THE FUNERAL.,"Their bald heads shining to the torches' ray,"
245,THE FUNERAL.,"The Bramins lead the way,"
246,THE FUNERAL.,Chaunting the funeral song.
247,THE FUNERAL.,{4}
248,THE FUNERAL.,And now at once they shout
249,THE FUNERAL.,Arvalan! Arvalan!
250,THE FUNERAL.,"With quick rebound of sound,"
251,THE FUNERAL.,"All in accordant cry,"
252,THE FUNERAL.,Arvalan! Arvalan!
253,THE FUNERAL.,The universal multitude reply.
254,THE FUNERAL.,In vain ye thunder on his ear the name!
255,THE FUNERAL.,Would ye awake the dead?
256,THE FUNERAL.,"Borne upright in his palankeen,"
257,THE FUNERAL.,There Arvalan is seen!
258,THE FUNERAL.,"A glow is on his face, . . . a lively red;"
259,THE FUNERAL.,'Tis but the crimson canopy
260,THE FUNERAL.,Which o'er his cheek the reddening shade hath shed.
261,THE FUNERAL.,"He moves, . . . he nods his head; . . ."
262,THE FUNERAL.,"But the motion comes from the bearers' tread,"
263,THE FUNERAL.,"As the body, borne aloft in state,"
264,THE FUNERAL.,Sways with the impulse of its own dead weight.
265,THE FUNERAL.,
266,THE FUNERAL.,5.
267,THE FUNERAL.,"Close following his dead son, Kehama came,"
268,THE FUNERAL.,"Nor joining in the ritual song,"
269,THE FUNERAL.,Nor calling the dear name;
270,THE FUNERAL.,"With head deprest and funeral vest,"
271,THE FUNERAL.,"And arms enfolded on his breast,"
272,THE FUNERAL.,{5}
273,THE FUNERAL.,Silent and lost in thought he moves along.
274,THE FUNERAL.,"King of the world, his slaves unenvying now"
275,THE FUNERAL.,Behold their wretched Lord; rejoiced they see
276,THE FUNERAL.,The mighty Rajah's misery;
277,THE FUNERAL.,"For nature in his pride hath dealt the blow,"
278,THE FUNERAL.,And taught the master of mankind to know
279,THE FUNERAL.,"Even he himself is man, and not exempt from woe."
280,THE FUNERAL.,
281,THE FUNERAL.,6.
282,THE FUNERAL.,"O sight of grief! the wives of Arvalan,"
283,THE FUNERAL.,"Young Azla, young Nealliny, are seen!"
284,THE FUNERAL.,"Their widow-robes of white,"
285,THE FUNERAL.,"With gold and jewels bright,"
286,THE FUNERAL.,Each like an Eastern queen.
287,THE FUNERAL.,"Woe! woe! around their palankeen,"
288,THE FUNERAL.,"As on a bridal day,"
289,THE FUNERAL.,"With symphony, and dance, and song,"
290,THE FUNERAL.,"Their kindred and their friends come on, . . ."
291,THE FUNERAL.,The dance of sacrifice! the funeral song!
292,THE FUNERAL.,"And next the victim slaves in long array,"
293,THE FUNERAL.,"Richly bedight to grace the fatal day,"
294,THE FUNERAL.,Move onward to their death;
295,THE FUNERAL.,The clarions' stirring breath
296,THE FUNERAL.,"Lifts their thin robes in every flowing fold,"
297,THE FUNERAL.,{6}
298,THE FUNERAL.,"And swells the woven gold,"
299,THE FUNERAL.,That on the agitated air
300,THE FUNERAL.,"Trembles, and glitters to the torches' glare."
301,THE FUNERAL.,
302,THE FUNERAL.,7.
303,THE FUNERAL.,"A man and maid of aspect wan and wild,"
304,THE FUNERAL.,"Then, side by side, by bowmen guarded, came."
305,THE FUNERAL.,O wretched father! O unhappy child!
306,THE FUNERAL.,Them were all eyes of all the throng exploring; . . .
307,THE FUNERAL.,Is this the daring man
308,THE FUNERAL.,Who raised his fatal hand at Arvalan?
309,THE FUNERAL.,Is this the wretch condemned to feel
310,THE FUNERAL.,Kehama's dreadful wrath?
311,THE FUNERAL.,"Them were all hearts of all the throng deploring,"
312,THE FUNERAL.,For not in that innumerable throng
313,THE FUNERAL.,Was one who lov'd the dead; for who could know
314,THE FUNERAL.,What aggravated wrong
315,THE FUNERAL.,Provok'd the desperate blow!
316,THE FUNERAL.,"Far, far behind, beyond all reach of sight,"
317,THE FUNERAL.,"In ordered files the torches flow along,"
318,THE FUNERAL.,One ever-lengthening line of gliding light:
319,THE FUNERAL.,"Far . . . far behind,"
320,THE FUNERAL.,"Rolls on the undistinguishable clamour,"
321,THE FUNERAL.,"Of horn, and trump, and tambour;"
322,THE FUNERAL.,{7}
323,THE FUNERAL.,Incessant at the roar
324,THE FUNERAL.,"Of streams which down the wintry mountain pour,"
325,THE FUNERAL.,And louder than the dread commotion
326,THE FUNERAL.,"Of stormy billows on a rocky shore,"
327,THE FUNERAL.,"When the winds rage over the wares,"
328,THE FUNERAL.,And Ocean to the Tempest raves.
329,THE FUNERAL.,
330,THE FUNERAL.,8.
331,THE FUNERAL.,"And now toward the bank they go,"
332,THE FUNERAL.,"Where, winding on their way below,"
333,THE FUNERAL.,Deep and strong the waters flow.
334,THE FUNERAL.,Here doth the funeral pile appear
335,THE FUNERAL.,"With myrrh and ambergris bestrew'd,"
336,THE FUNERAL.,And built of precious sandal wood.
337,THE FUNERAL.,They cease their music and their outcry here;
338,THE FUNERAL.,Gently they rest the bier:
339,THE FUNERAL.,"They wet the face of Arvalan,"
340,THE FUNERAL.,No sign of life the sprinkled drops excite.
341,THE FUNERAL.,"They feel his breast, . . . no motion there;"
342,THE FUNERAL.,"They feel his lips, . . . no breath;"
343,THE FUNERAL.,"For not with feeble, nor with erring hand,"
344,THE FUNERAL.,The stern avenger dealt the blow of death.
345,THE FUNERAL.,"Then with a doubling peal and deeper blast,"
346,THE FUNERAL.,"The tambours and the trumpets sound on high,"
347,THE FUNERAL.,{8}
348,THE FUNERAL.,And with a last and loudest cry
349,THE FUNERAL.,They call on Arvalan.
350,THE FUNERAL.,
351,THE FUNERAL.,9.
352,THE FUNERAL.,Woe! woe! for Azla takes her seat
353,THE FUNERAL.,Upon the funeral pile!
354,THE FUNERAL.,"Calmly she took her seat,"
355,THE FUNERAL.,Calmly the whole terrific pomp survey'd;
356,THE FUNERAL.,As on her lap the while
357,THE FUNERAL.,The lifeless head of Arvalan was laid.
358,THE FUNERAL.,"Woe! woe! Nealliny,"
359,THE FUNERAL.,The young Nealliny!
360,THE FUNERAL.,"They strip her ornaments away,"
361,THE FUNERAL.,"Bracelet and anklet, ring, and chain, and zone;"
362,THE FUNERAL.,Around her neck they leave
363,THE FUNERAL.,"The marriage knot alone, . . ."
364,THE FUNERAL.,"That marriage band, which when"
365,THE FUNERAL.,"Yon waning moon was young,"
366,THE FUNERAL.,Around her virgin neck
367,THE FUNERAL.,With bridal joy was hung.
368,THE FUNERAL.,"Then with white flowers, the coronal of death,"
369,THE FUNERAL.,Her jetty locks they crown.
370,THE FUNERAL.,O sight of misery!
371,THE FUNERAL.,"Yon cannot hear her cries, . . . all other sound"
372,THE FUNERAL.,{9}
373,THE FUNERAL.,In that wild dissonance is drown'd; . . .
374,THE FUNERAL.,But in her face you see
375,THE FUNERAL.,"The supplication and the agony, . . ."
376,THE FUNERAL.,See in her swelling throat the desperate strength
377,THE FUNERAL.,That with vain effort struggles yet for life;
378,THE FUNERAL.,"Her arms contracted now in fruitless strife,"
379,THE FUNERAL.,Now wildly at full length
380,THE FUNERAL.,"Towards the crowd in vain for pity spread, . . ."
381,THE FUNERAL.,"They force her on, they bind her to the dead."
382,THE FUNERAL.,
383,THE FUNERAL.,10.
384,THE FUNERAL.,Then all around retire;
385,THE FUNERAL.,"Circling the pile, the ministring Bramins stand,"
386,THE FUNERAL.,Each lifting in his hand a torch on fire.
387,THE FUNERAL.,Alone the Father of the dead advanced
388,THE FUNERAL.,And lit the funeral pyre.
389,THE FUNERAL.,
390,THE FUNERAL.,11.
391,THE FUNERAL.,At once on every side
392,THE FUNERAL.,The circling torches drop;
393,THE FUNERAL.,At once on every side
394,THE FUNERAL.,The fragrant oil is pour'd;
395,THE FUNERAL.,At once on every side
396,THE FUNERAL.,The rapid flames rush up.
397,THE FUNERAL.,{10}
398,THE FUNERAL.,Then hand in hand the victim band
399,THE FUNERAL.,Roll in the dance around the funeral pyre;
400,THE FUNERAL.,Their garments' flying folds
401,THE FUNERAL.,Float inward to the fire.
402,THE FUNERAL.,In drunken whirl they wheel around;
403,THE FUNERAL.,"One drops, . . . another plunges in;"
404,THE FUNERAL.,And still with overwhelming din
405,THE FUNERAL.,The tambours and the trumpets sound;
406,THE FUNERAL.,"And clap of hand, and shouts, and cries,"
407,THE FUNERAL.,From all the multitude arise:
408,THE FUNERAL.,"While round and round, in giddy wheel,"
409,THE FUNERAL.,"Intoxicate they roll and reel,"
410,THE FUNERAL.,"Till one by one whirl'd in they fall,"
411,THE FUNERAL.,And the devouring flames have swallowed all.
412,THE FUNERAL.,
413,THE FUNERAL.,12.
414,THE FUNERAL.,Then all was still; the drums and clarions ceas'd;
415,THE FUNERAL.,The multitude were hush'd in silent awe;
416,THE FUNERAL.,Only the roaring of the flames was heard.

427,THE CURSE.,Kehama mov'd; there on the altar-stone
428,THE CURSE.,"Honey and rice he spread,"
429,THE CURSE.,There with collected voice and painful tone
430,THE CURSE.,He call'd upon his son.
431,THE CURSE.,Lo! Arvalan appears.
432,THE CURSE.,Only Kehama's powerful eye beheld
433,THE CURSE.,The thin etherial spirit hovering nigh;
434,THE CURSE.,Only the Rajah's ear
435,THE CURSE.,Receiv'd his feeble breath.
436,THE CURSE.,"And is this all? the mournful spirit said,"
437,THE CURSE.,This all that thou canst give me after death?
438,THE CURSE.,{12}
439,THE CURSE.,"This unavailing pomp,"

441,THE CURSE.,
442,THE CURSE.,2.
443,THE CURSE.,"In bitterness the Rajah heard,"

447,ARVALAN.,ARVALAN.
448,ARVALAN.,"Art thou not powerful, . . . even like a God?"
449,ARVALAN.,"And must I, through my years of wandering,"
450,ARVALAN.,"Shivering and naked to the elements,"
451,ARVALAN.,In wretchedness await
452,ARVALAN.,The hour of Yamen's wrath?
453,ARVALAN.,I thought thou wouldst embody me anew.
454,ARVALAN.,"Undying as I am, . . ."
455,ARVALAN.,"Yea, re-create me! . . . Father, is this all!"
456,ARVALAN.,This all! and thou Almighty!
457,ARVALAN.,
458,ARVALAN.,3.
459,ARVALAN.,"But in that wrongful and upbraiding tone,"
460,ARVALAN.,"Kehama found relief,"
461,ARVALAN.,For rising anger half supprest his grief.
462,ARVALAN.,Reproach not me! he cried;
463,ARVALAN.,{13}
464,ARVALAN.,"Had I not spell-secur'd thee from disease,"
465,ARVALAN.,"Fire, sword, . . . all common accidents of man, . . ."
466,ARVALAN.,"And thou! . . . fool, fool, . . . to perish by a stake!"
467,ARVALAN.,And by a peasant's arm! . . .
468,ARVALAN.,"Even now, when from reluctant Heaven"
469,ARVALAN.,"Forcing new gifts and mightier attributes,"
470,ARVALAN.,So soon I should have quell'd the Death-God's power.
471,ARVALAN.,
472,ARVALAN.,4.
473,ARVALAN.,"Waste not thy wrath on me, quoth Arvalan,"
474,ARVALAN.,"It was my hour of folly! Fate prevail'd,"
475,ARVALAN.,Nor boots it to reproach me that I fell.
476,ARVALAN.,"I am in misery, Father! Other souls"
477,ARVALAN.,"Predoom'd to Indra's Heaven, enjoy the dawn"
478,ARVALAN.,Of bliss: . . . to them the tempered elements
479,ARVALAN.,"Minister joy, genial delight the sun"
480,ARVALAN.,"Sheds on their happy being, and the stars"
481,ARVALAN.,Effuse on them benignant influencies;
482,ARVALAN.,"And thus o'er earth and air they roam at will,"
483,ARVALAN.,"And when the number of their days is full,"
484,ARVALAN.,Go fearlessly before the awful throne.
485,ARVALAN.,"But I, . . . all naked feeling and raw life, . . ."
486,ARVALAN.,What worse than this hath Yamen's hell in store?
487,ARVALAN.,"If ever thou didst love me, mercy, Father!"
488,ARVALAN.,{14}
489,ARVALAN.,"Save me, for thou canst save: . . . the Elements"

491,ARVALAN.,
492,KEHAMA.,KEHAMA.
493,KEHAMA.,The Elements
494,KEHAMA.,Shall torture thee no more; even while I speak
495,KEHAMA.,Already dost then feel their power is gone.
496,KEHAMA.,"Fear not! I cannot call again the past,"
497,KEHAMA.,Fate hath made that its own; but Fate shall yield
498,KEHAMA.,To me the future; and thy doom be fix'd
499,KEHAMA.,"By mine, not Yamen's will. Meantime, all power"
500,KEHAMA.,Whereof thy feeble spirit can be made
501,KEHAMA.,"Participant, I give. Is there aught else"
502,KEHAMA.,To mitigate thy lot?
503,KEHAMA.,
504,ARVALAN.,ARVALAN.
505,ARVALAN.,Only the sight of vengeance. Give me that!
506,ARVALAN.,"Vengeance, full, worthy vengeance! . . . not the stroke"
507,ARVALAN.,"Of sodden punishment, . . . no agony"
508,ARVALAN.,"That spends itself and leaves the wretch at rest,"
509,ARVALAN.,But lasting long revenge.
510,ARVALAN.,

515,KEHAMA.,
516,KEHAMA.,5.
517,KEHAMA.,"So as he spake, a glow of dreadful pride"
518,KEHAMA.,Inflam'd his cheek: with quick and angry stride
519,KEHAMA.,"He mov'd toward the pile,"
520,KEHAMA.,"And rais'd his hand to hush the crowd, and cried"
521,KEHAMA.,"Bring forth the murderer! At the Rajah's voice,"
522,KEHAMA.,"Calmly, and like a man whom fear had stunn'd,"
523,KEHAMA.,"Ladurlad came, obedient to the call."
524,KEHAMA.,"But Kailyal started at the sound,"
525,KEHAMA.,"And gave a womanly shriek, and back she drew,"
526,KEHAMA.,"And eagerly she roll'd her eyes around,"
527,KEHAMA.,"As if to seek for aid, albeit she knew"
528,KEHAMA.,No aid could there be found.
529,KEHAMA.,
530,KEHAMA.,6.
531,KEHAMA.,"It chanced that near her, on the river-brink,"
532,KEHAMA.,The sculptur'd form of Marriataly stood;
533,KEHAMA.,"It was an idol roughly hewn of wood,"
534,KEHAMA.,"Artless, and poor, and rude."
535,KEHAMA.,The Goddess of the poor was she;
536,KEHAMA.,None else regarded her with piety.
537,KEHAMA.,"But when that holy image Kailyal view'd,"
538,KEHAMA.,"To that she sprung, to that she clung,"
539,KEHAMA.,"On her own goddess with close-clasping arms,"
540,KEHAMA.,{16}
541,KEHAMA.,For life the maiden hung.
542,KEHAMA.,They seiz'd the maid; with unrelenting grasp
543,KEHAMA.,They bruis'd her tender limbs;
544,KEHAMA.,"She, nothing yielding, to this only hope"
545,KEHAMA.,Clings with the strength of frenzy and despair.
546,KEHAMA.,"She screams not now, she breathes not now,"
547,KEHAMA.,"She sends not up one vow,"
548,KEHAMA.,"She forms not in her soul one secret prayer,"
549,KEHAMA.,"All thought, all feeling, and all powers' of life"
550,KEHAMA.,In the one effort centering. Wrathful they
551,KEHAMA.,With tug and strain would force the maid away. . . .
552,KEHAMA.,"Didst thou, O Marriataly, see their strife?"
553,KEHAMA.,In pity didst thou see the suffering maid?
554,KEHAMA.,"Or was thine anger kindled, that rude hands"
555,KEHAMA.,Assail'd thy holy image? . . . for behold
556,KEHAMA.,The holy image shakes!
557,KEHAMA.,"Irreverently bold, they deem the maid"
558,KEHAMA.,"Relax'd her stubborn hold,"
559,KEHAMA.,And now with force redoubled drag their prey;
560,KEHAMA.,And now the rooted idol to their sway
561,KEHAMA.,"Bends, . . . yields, . . . and now it falls. But then they scream,"
562,KEHAMA.,"For lo! they feel the crumbling bank give way,"
563,KEHAMA.,And all are plunged into the stream.
564,KEHAMA.,
565,KEHAMA.,{17}
566,KEHAMA.,
567,KEHAMA.,7.
568,KEHAMA.,"She hath escap'd my will, Kehama cried,"
569,KEHAMA.,"She hath escap'd, . . . but thou art here,"
570,KEHAMA.,"I have thee still,"
571,KEHAMA.,The worser criminal!
572,KEHAMA.,"And on Ladurlad, while he spake, severe"
573,KEHAMA.,He fix'd his dreadful frown.
574,KEHAMA.,The strong reflection of the pile
575,KEHAMA.,"Lit his dark lineaments,"
576,KEHAMA.,"Lit the protruded brow, the gathered front,"
577,KEHAMA.,The steady eye of wrath.
578,KEHAMA.,
579,KEHAMA.,8.
580,KEHAMA.,"But while the fearful silence yet endur'd,"
581,KEHAMA.,Ladurlad rous'd his soul;
582,KEHAMA.,Ere yet the voice of destiny
583,KEHAMA.,"Which trembled on the Rajah's lips was loos'd,"
584,KEHAMA.,"Eager he interpos'd,"
585,KEHAMA.,As if despair had waken'd him to hope;
586,KEHAMA.,Mercy! oh mercy! only in defence . . .
587,KEHAMA.,"Only instinctively, . . ."
588,KEHAMA.,"Only to save my child, I smote the Prince."
589,KEHAMA.,"King of the world, be merciful!"
590,KEHAMA.,"Crush me, . . . but torture not!"
591,KEHAMA.,
592,KEHAMA.,{18}
593,KEHAMA.,
594,KEHAMA.,9.
595,KEHAMA.,"The Man-Almighty deign'd him no reply,"
596,KEHAMA.,Still he stood silent; in no human mood
597,KEHAMA.,"Of mercy, in no hesitating thought"
598,KEHAMA.,Of right and justice. At the length he rais'd
599,KEHAMA.,"His brow yet unrelax'd, . . . his lips unclos'd,"
600,KEHAMA.,"And utter'd from the heart,"
601,KEHAMA.,"With the whole feeling of his soul enforced,"
602,KEHAMA.,The gather'd vengeance came.
603,KEHAMA.,
604,KEHAMA.,10.
605,KEHAMA.,I charm thy life
606,KEHAMA.,"From the weapons of strife,"
607,KEHAMA.,"From stone and from wood,"
608,KEHAMA.,"From fire and from flood,"
609,KEHAMA.,"From the serpent's tooth,"
610,KEHAMA.,And the beasts of blood:
611,KEHAMA.,"From Sickness I charm thee,"
612,KEHAMA.,And Time shall not harm thee;
613,KEHAMA.,"But Earth, which is mine,"
614,KEHAMA.,Its fruits shall deny thee;
615,KEHAMA.,"And Water shall hear me,"
616,KEHAMA.,And know thee and fly thee;
617,KEHAMA.,And the Winds shall not touch thee
618,KEHAMA.,{19}
619,KEHAMA.,"When they pass by thee,"
620,KEHAMA.,"And the Dews shall not wet thee,"
621,KEHAMA.,When they fall nigh thee:
622,KEHAMA.,And thou shalt seek Death
623,KEHAMA.,"To release thee, in vain;"
624,KEHAMA.,"Thou shalt live in thy pain,"
625,KEHAMA.,"While Kehama shall reign,"
626,KEHAMA.,"With a fire in thy heart,"
627,KEHAMA.,And a fire in thy brain;
628,KEHAMA.,"And sleep shall obey me,"
629,KEHAMA.,"And visit thee never,"
630,KEHAMA.,And the Curse shall be on thee
631,KEHAMA.,For ever and ever.
632,KEHAMA.,
633,KEHAMA.,11.
634,KEHAMA.,"There where the Curse had stricken him,"
635,KEHAMA.,"There stood the miserable man,"
636,KEHAMA.,"There stood Ladurlad, with loose-hanging arms,"
637,KEHAMA.,And eyes of idiot wandering.
638,KEHAMA.,"Was it a dream? alas,"
639,KEHAMA.,"He heard the river flow,"
640,KEHAMA.,"He heard the crumbling of the pile,"
641,KEHAMA.,He heard the wind which shower'd
642,KEHAMA.,The thin white ashes round.
643,KEHAMA.,{20}
644,KEHAMA.,"There motionless he stood,"
645,KEHAMA.,"As if he hop'd it were a dream,"
646,KEHAMA.,"And fear'd to move, lest he should prove"
647,KEHAMA.,The actual misery;
648,KEHAMA.,"And still at times he met Kehama's eye,"
649,KEHAMA.,Kehama's eye that fasten'd on him still.

661,THE RECOVERY.,"Their din the instruments begin,"
662,THE RECOVERY.,And once again join in
663,THE RECOVERY.,With overwhelming sound.
664,THE RECOVERY.,"Ladurlad starts, . . . he looks around."

674,THE RECOVERY.,The solace and the joy of many a year
675,THE RECOVERY.,"Of widowhood! is she then gone,"
676,THE RECOVERY.,"And is he left all-utterly alone,"
677,THE RECOVERY.,"To bear his blasting curse, and none"
678,THE RECOVERY.,To succour or deplore him?
679,THE RECOVERY.,He staggers from the dreadful spot; the throng
680,THE RECOVERY.,Give way in fear before him;
681,THE RECOVERY.,"Like one who carries pestilence about,"
682,THE RECOVERY.,"Shuddering they shun him, where he moves along."
683,THE RECOVERY.,And now he wanders on
684,THE RECOVERY.,Beyond the noisy rout;
685,THE RECOVERY.,"He cannot fly and leave his curse behind,"
686,THE RECOVERY.,Yet doth he seem to find
687,THE RECOVERY.,A comfort in the change of circumstance.
688,THE RECOVERY.,"Adown the shore he strays,"

696,THE RECOVERY.,In distance indistinct and dimly seen?
697,THE RECOVERY.,{23}
698,THE RECOVERY.,The childless one with idle eye
699,THE RECOVERY.,Followed its motion thoughtlessly;
700,THE RECOVERY.,"Idly he gaz'd, unknowing why,"
701,THE RECOVERY.,And half unconscious that he watch'd its way.
702,THE RECOVERY.,Belike it is a tree
703,THE RECOVERY.,"Which some rude tempest, in its sudden sway,"
704,THE RECOVERY.,"Tore from the rock, or from the hollow shore"
705,THE RECOVERY.,The undermining stream hath swept away.

712,THE RECOVERY.,Had heard an angel's call.
713,THE RECOVERY.,"Yea, Marriataly, then hast deign'd to save!"
714,THE RECOVERY.,"Yea, Goddess! it is she,"
715,THE RECOVERY.,"To thy dear image clinging senselessly,"

732,THE RECOVERY.,Upon the farther side a level shore
733,THE RECOVERY.,Of sand was spread: thither Ladurlad bore

736,THE RECOVERY.,"He laid the livid maid,"
737,THE RECOVERY.,Rais'd up against his knees her drooping head;
738,THE RECOVERY.,"Bent to her lips, . . . her lips as pale as death, . . ."
739,THE RECOVERY.,"If he might feel her breath,"

743,THE RECOVERY.,
744,THE RECOVERY.,6.
745,THE RECOVERY.,"Soon did his touch perceive, or fancy there,"
746,THE RECOVERY.,The first faint motion of returning life.
747,THE RECOVERY.,"He chafes her feet, and lays them bare"
748,THE RECOVERY.,In the sun; and now again upon her breast
749,THE RECOVERY.,{25}
750,THE RECOVERY.,"Lays his hot hand; and now her lips he prest,"

752,THE RECOVERY.,And her lips tremble too!
753,THE RECOVERY.,"The breath comes palpably,"
754,THE RECOVERY.,Her quivering lids unclose
755,THE RECOVERY.,"Feebly and feebly fell,"
756,THE RECOVERY.,Relapsing as it seem'd to dead repose.

762,THE RECOVERY.,"And painfully and slowly writh'd at fits,"
763,THE RECOVERY.,At fits to short convulsive starts was stung.
764,THE RECOVERY.,Till when the struggle and strong agony
765,THE RECOVERY.,"Had left her, quietly she lay repos'd:"
766,THE RECOVERY.,"Her eyes now resting on Ladurlad's face,"
767,THE RECOVERY.,"Relapsing now, and now again unclos'd."
768,THE RECOVERY.,"The look she fix'd upon his face, implies"
769,THE RECOVERY.,"Nor thought nor feeling; senselessly she lies,"
770,THE RECOVERY.,Compos'd like one who sleeps with open eyes.
771,THE RECOVERY.,
772,THE RECOVERY.,8.

777,THE RECOVERY.,"As a poor mother ventures who draws near,"
778,THE RECOVERY.,"With silent footstep, to her child's sick bed."
779,THE RECOVERY.,"My Father! cried the maid, and rais'd her head,"
780,THE RECOVERY.,"Awakening then to life and thought, . . . thou here?"
781,THE RECOVERY.,"For when his voice she heard,"
782,THE RECOVERY.,"The dreadful past recurr'd,"
783,THE RECOVERY.,"Which dimly, like a dream of pain,"
784,THE RECOVERY.,Till now with troubled sense confus'd her brain.
785,THE RECOVERY.,
786,THE RECOVERY.,9.
787,THE RECOVERY.,"And hath he spar'd us then? she cried,"
788,THE RECOVERY.,"Half rising as she spake,"
789,THE RECOVERY.,For hope and joy the sudden strength supplied;
790,THE RECOVERY.,"In mercy hath he curb'd his cruel will,"
791,THE RECOVERY.,"That still thou livest? But as thus she said,"
792,THE RECOVERY.,"Impatient of that look of hope, her sire"
793,THE RECOVERY.,Shook hastily his head;
794,THE RECOVERY.,"Oh! he hath laid a Curse upon my life,"
795,THE RECOVERY.,"A clinging curse, quoth he;"
796,THE RECOVERY.,"Hath sent a fire into my heart and brain,"
797,THE RECOVERY.,"A burning fire, for ever there to be!"

808,THE RECOVERY.,"This is a dream! exclaim'd the incredulous maid,"

810,THE RECOVERY.,Which in her larger eye was manifest.
811,THE RECOVERY.,This is a dream! she rose and laid her hand
812,THE RECOVERY.,"Upon her father's brow, to try the charm;"
813,THE RECOVERY.,"He could not bear the pressure there; . . . he shrunk, . . ."
814,THE RECOVERY.,"He warded off her arm,"
815,THE RECOVERY.,"As though it were an enemy's blow, he smote"
816,THE RECOVERY.,His daughter's arm aside.
817,THE RECOVERY.,"Her eye glanced down, his mantle she espied"

912,THE DEPARTURE.,Exclaim'd the wretched man in his despair;
913,THE DEPARTURE.,"Air knows him, Water knows him; Sleep"
914,THE DEPARTURE.,His dreadful word will keep;
915,THE DEPARTURE.,"Even in the grave there is no rest for me,"
916,THE DEPARTURE.,"Cut off from that last hope, . . . the wretches' joy;"
917,THE DEPARTURE.,"And Veeshnoo hath no power to save,"
918,THE DEPARTURE.,Nor Seeva to destroy.

921,THE DEPARTURE.,
922,THE DEPARTURE.,6.
923,THE DEPARTURE.,"Oh! wrong not them! quoth Kailyal,"
924,THE DEPARTURE.,Wrong not the Heavenly Powers!
925,THE DEPARTURE.,Our hope is all in them: They are not blind!
926,THE DEPARTURE.,"And lighter wrongs than ours,"
927,THE DEPARTURE.,"And lighter crimes than his,"
928,THE DEPARTURE.,Have drawn the Incarnate down among mankind;
929,THE DEPARTURE.,"Already have the Immortals heard our cries,"
930,THE DEPARTURE.,And in the mercy of their righteousness
931,THE DEPARTURE.,Beheld us in the hour of our distress!
932,THE DEPARTURE.,"She spake with streaming eyes,"
933,THE DEPARTURE.,Where pious love and ardent feeling beam;
934,THE DEPARTURE.,"And turning to the Image, threw"
935,THE DEPARTURE.,"Her grateful arms around it, . . . It was thou"
936,THE DEPARTURE.,Who saved'st me from the stream!
937,THE DEPARTURE.,"My Marriataly, it was thou!"
938,THE DEPARTURE.,I had not else been here
939,THE DEPARTURE.,"To share my Father's Curse,"
940,THE DEPARTURE.,"To suffer now, . . . and yet to thank thee thus!"
941,THE DEPARTURE.,
942,THE DEPARTURE.,7.
943,THE DEPARTURE.,"Here then, the maiden cried, dear Father, here"
944,THE DEPARTURE.,"Raise our own Goddess, our divine Preserver!"
945,THE DEPARTURE.,"The mighty of the earth despise her rites,"
946,THE DEPARTURE.,{33}
947,THE DEPARTURE.,She loves the poor who serve her.
948,THE DEPARTURE.,"Set up her image here,"
949,THE DEPARTURE.,"With heart and voice the guardian Goddess bless,"
950,THE DEPARTURE.,For jealously would she resent
951,THE DEPARTURE.,Neglect and thanklessness. . . .
952,THE DEPARTURE.,"Set up her image here,"
953,THE DEPARTURE.,And bless her for her aid with tongue and soul sincere.
954,THE DEPARTURE.,
955,THE DEPARTURE.,8.
956,THE DEPARTURE.,"So saying, on her knees the maid"
957,THE DEPARTURE.,Began the pious toil.
958,THE DEPARTURE.,Soon their joint labour scoops the easy soil;
959,THE DEPARTURE.,"They raise the image up with reverent hand,"
960,THE DEPARTURE.,And round its rooted base they heap the sand.
961,THE DEPARTURE.,"O Thou whom we adore,"
962,THE DEPARTURE.,"O Marriataly, thee do I implore,"
963,THE DEPARTURE.,"The virgin cried; my Goddess, pardon thou"
964,THE DEPARTURE.,"The unwilling wrong, that I no more,"
965,THE DEPARTURE.,"With dance and song,"
966,THE DEPARTURE.,"Can do thy daily service, as of yore!"
967,THE DEPARTURE.,"The flowers which last I wreath'd around thy brow,"
968,THE DEPARTURE.,Are withering there; and never now
969,THE DEPARTURE.,"Shall I at eve adore thee,"
970,THE DEPARTURE.,"And swimming round with arms outspread,"
971,THE DEPARTURE.,{34}
972,THE DEPARTURE.,"Poise the full pitcher on my head,"
973,THE DEPARTURE.,In dextrous dance before thee;
974,THE DEPARTURE.,"White underneath the reedy shed, at rest,"
975,THE DEPARTURE.,"My father sate the evening rites to view,"
976,THE DEPARTURE.,"And blest thy name, and blest"
977,THE DEPARTURE.,His daughter too.
978,THE DEPARTURE.,
979,THE DEPARTURE.,9.
980,THE DEPARTURE.,"Then heaving from her heart a heavy sigh,"
981,THE DEPARTURE.,"O Goddess! from that happy home, cried she,"
982,THE DEPARTURE.,The Almighty Man hath forced us!
983,THE DEPARTURE.,And homeward with the thought unconsciously
984,THE DEPARTURE.,"She turn'd her dizzy eye. . . . But there on high,"
985,THE DEPARTURE.,"With many a dome, and pinnacle, and spire,"
986,THE DEPARTURE.,"The summits of, the Golden Palaces"
987,THE DEPARTURE.,"Blaz'd in the dark blue sky, aloft, like fire."
988,THE DEPARTURE.,"Father, away! she cried, away!"
989,THE DEPARTURE.,Why linger we so nigh?
990,THE DEPARTURE.,For not to him hath Nature given
991,THE DEPARTURE.,"The thousand eyes of Deity,"
992,THE DEPARTURE.,"Always and every where with open sight,"
993,THE DEPARTURE.,To persecute our flight!
994,THE DEPARTURE.,"Away . . . away! she said,"
995,THE DEPARTURE.,"And took her father's hand, and like a child"
996,THE DEPARTURE.,He followed where she led.

1007,THE SEPARATION.,Homeward the tall flamingo wings his flight;
1008,THE SEPARATION.,"And where he sails athwart the setting beam,"
1009,THE SEPARATION.,His scarlet plumage glows with deeper light.
1010,THE SEPARATION.,"The watchman, at the wish'd approach of night,"
1011,THE SEPARATION.,"Gladly forsakes the field, where he all day,"
1012,THE SEPARATION.,"To scare the winged plunderers from their prey,"
1013,THE SEPARATION.,"With shout and sling, on yonder clay-built height,"
1014,THE SEPARATION.,Hath borne the sultry ray.
1015,THE SEPARATION.,"Hark! at the Golden Palaces,"
1016,THE SEPARATION.,The Bramin strikes the hour.
1017,THE SEPARATION.,"For leagues and leagues around, the brazen sound"

1021,THE SEPARATION.,
1022,THE SEPARATION.,2.
1023,THE SEPARATION.,"Behold them wandering on their hopeless way,"
1024,THE SEPARATION.,"Unknowing where they stray,"
1025,THE SEPARATION.,Yet sure where'er they stop to find no rest.
1026,THE SEPARATION.,"The evening gale is blowing,"
1027,THE SEPARATION.,It plays among the trees;
1028,THE SEPARATION.,"Like plumes upon a warrior's crest,"
1029,THE SEPARATION.,They see yon cocoas tossing to the breeze.
1030,THE SEPARATION.,"Ladurlad views them with impatient mind,"
1031,THE SEPARATION.,Impatiently he hears
1032,THE SEPARATION.,"The gale of evening blowing,"
1033,THE SEPARATION.,"The sound of waters flowing,"
1034,THE SEPARATION.,As if all sights and sounds combin'd
1035,THE SEPARATION.,To mock his irremediable woe:
1036,THE SEPARATION.,"For not for him the blessed waters flow,"
1037,THE SEPARATION.,"For not for him the gales of evening blow,"
1038,THE SEPARATION.,"A fire is in his heart and brain,"
1039,THE SEPARATION.,And Nature hath no healing for his pain.

1042,THE SEPARATION.,"The Moon is up, still pale"
1043,THE SEPARATION.,{37}
1044,THE SEPARATION.,Amid the lingering light.
1045,THE SEPARATION.,"A cloud ascending in the eastern sky,"
1046,THE SEPARATION.,"Sails slowly o'er the vale,"
1047,THE SEPARATION.,And darkens round and closes-in the night.
1048,THE SEPARATION.,"No hospitable house is nigh,"
1049,THE SEPARATION.,No traveller's home the wanderers to invite.
1050,THE SEPARATION.,"Forlorn, and with long watching overworn,"
1051,THE SEPARATION.,The wretched father and the wretched child
1052,THE SEPARATION.,Lie down amid the wild.
1053,THE SEPARATION.,
1054,THE SEPARATION.,4.
1055,THE SEPARATION.,"Before them full in sight,"
1056,THE SEPARATION.,"A white flag flapping to the winds of night,"
1057,THE SEPARATION.,Marks where the tyger seiz'd his human prey.
1058,THE SEPARATION.,"Far, far away with natural dread,"
1059,THE SEPARATION.,"Shunning the perilous spot,"
1060,THE SEPARATION.,At other times abhorrent had they fled;
1061,THE SEPARATION.,But now they heed it not.
1062,THE SEPARATION.,Nothing they care; the boding death-flag now
1063,THE SEPARATION.,In vain for them may gleam and flutter there.
1064,THE SEPARATION.,"Despair and agony in him,"
1065,THE SEPARATION.,Prevent all other thought;
1066,THE SEPARATION.,"And Kailyal hath no heart or sense for aught,"
1067,THE SEPARATION.,Save her dear father's strange and miserable lot.

1074,THE SEPARATION.,"His head Ladurlad laid,"
1075,THE SEPARATION.,And never word he spake;
1076,THE SEPARATION.,"Nor heav'd he one complaining sigh,"
1077,THE SEPARATION.,"Nor groan'd he with his misery,"
1078,THE SEPARATION.,But silently for her dear sake
1079,THE SEPARATION.,Endur'd the raging pain.
1080,THE SEPARATION.,"And now the moon was hid on high,"
1081,THE SEPARATION.,No stars were glimmering in the sky;
1082,THE SEPARATION.,"She could not see her father's eye,"
1083,THE SEPARATION.,How red with burning agony.
1084,THE SEPARATION.,Perhaps he may be cooler now;
1085,THE SEPARATION.,"She hoped, and long'd to touch his brow"
1086,THE SEPARATION.,"With gentle hand, yet did not dare"
1087,THE SEPARATION.,To lay the painful pressure there.
1088,THE SEPARATION.,"Now forward from the tree she bent,"
1089,THE SEPARATION.,"And anxiously her head she leant,"
1090,THE SEPARATION.,And listened to his breath.
1091,THE SEPARATION.,"Ladurlad's breath was short and quick,"
1092,THE SEPARATION.,"Yet regular it came,"
1093,THE SEPARATION.,"And like the slumber of the sick,"
1094,THE SEPARATION.,In pantings still the same.
1095,THE SEPARATION.,{39}
1096,THE SEPARATION.,"Oh if he sleeps! . . . her lips unclose,"
1097,THE SEPARATION.,"Intently listening to the sound,"
1098,THE SEPARATION.,That equal sound so like repose.
1099,THE SEPARATION.,"Still quietly the sufferer lies,"
1100,THE SEPARATION.,Bearing his torment now with resolute will;
1101,THE SEPARATION.,"He neither moves, nor groans, nor sighs."
1102,THE SEPARATION.,Doth satiate cruelty bestow
1103,THE SEPARATION.,"This little respite to his woe,"
1104,THE SEPARATION.,"She thought, or are there Gods who look below!"
1105,THE SEPARATION.,
1106,THE SEPARATION.,6.
1107,THE SEPARATION.,"Perchance, thought Kailyal, willingly deceiv'd,"
1108,THE SEPARATION.,"Our Marriataly hath his pain reliev'd,"
1109,THE SEPARATION.,And she hath bade the blessed sleep assuage
1110,THE SEPARATION.,"His agony, despite the Rajah's rage."
1111,THE SEPARATION.,"That was a hope which fill'd her gushing eyes,"
1112,THE SEPARATION.,"And made her heart in silent yearnings rise,"
1113,THE SEPARATION.,To bless the Power divine in thankfulness.
1114,THE SEPARATION.,"And yielding to that joyful thought her mind,"
1115,THE SEPARATION.,Backward the maid her aching head reclin'd
1116,THE SEPARATION.,"Against the tree, and to her father's breath"
1117,THE SEPARATION.,In fear she hearken'd still with earnest ear.
1118,THE SEPARATION.,But soon forgetful fits the effort broke:
1119,THE SEPARATION.,In starts of recollection then she woke;
1120,THE SEPARATION.,{40}
1121,THE SEPARATION.,Till now benignant Nature overcame
1122,THE SEPARATION.,"The Virgin's weary and exhausted frame,"
1123,THE SEPARATION.,"Nor able more her painful watch to keep,"
1124,THE SEPARATION.,"She clos'd her heavy lids, and sunk to sleep."
1125,THE SEPARATION.,
1126,THE SEPARATION.,7.
1127,THE SEPARATION.,"Vain was her hope! he did not rest from pain,"
1128,THE SEPARATION.,The Curse was burning in his brain.
1129,THE SEPARATION.,"Alas! the innocent maiden thought he slept,"
1130,THE SEPARATION.,"But Sleep the Rajah's dread commandment kept,"
1131,THE SEPARATION.,Sleep knew Kehama's Curse.
1132,THE SEPARATION.,"The dews of night fell round them now,"
1133,THE SEPARATION.,"They never bath'd Ladurlad's brow,"
1134,THE SEPARATION.,They knew Kehama's Curse.
1135,THE SEPARATION.,"The night-wind is abroad,"
1136,THE SEPARATION.,Aloft it moves among the stirring trees.
1137,THE SEPARATION.,"He only heard the breeze, . . ."
1138,THE SEPARATION.,"No healing aid to him it brought,"
1139,THE SEPARATION.,"It play'd around his head and touch'd him not,"
1140,THE SEPARATION.,It knew Kehama's Curse.
1141,THE SEPARATION.,
1142,THE SEPARATION.,8.
1143,THE SEPARATION.,"Listening, Ladurlad lay in his despair,"
1144,THE SEPARATION.,"If Kailyal slept, for wherefore should she share"
1145,THE SEPARATION.,{41}
1146,THE SEPARATION.,Her father's wretchedness which none could cure?
1147,THE SEPARATION.,Better alone to suffer; he must bear
1148,THE SEPARATION.,"The burthen of his Curse, but why endure"
1149,THE SEPARATION.,The unavailing presence of her grief?
1150,THE SEPARATION.,"She too, apart from him, might find relief;"
1151,THE SEPARATION.,"For dead the Rajah deem'd her, and as thus"
1152,THE SEPARATION.,"Already she his dread revenge had fled,"
1153,THE SEPARATION.,So might she still escape and live secure.
1154,THE SEPARATION.,
1155,THE SEPARATION.,9.
1156,THE SEPARATION.,"Gently he lifts his head,"
1157,THE SEPARATION.,And Kailyal does not feel;
1158,THE SEPARATION.,"Gently he rises up, . . . she slumbers still;"
1159,THE SEPARATION.,Gently he steals away with silent tread.
1160,THE SEPARATION.,"Anon she started, for she felt him gone;"
1161,THE SEPARATION.,"She call'd, and through the stillness of the night,"
1162,THE SEPARATION.,His step was heard in flight.
1163,THE SEPARATION.,"Mistrustful for a moment of the sound,"
1164,THE SEPARATION.,She listens! till the step is heard no more;
1165,THE SEPARATION.,"But then she knows that he indeed is gone,"
1166,THE SEPARATION.,And with a thrilling shriek she rushes on.
1167,THE SEPARATION.,The darkness and the wood impede her speed;
1168,THE SEPARATION.,"She lifts her voice again,"
1169,THE SEPARATION.,"Ladurlad! . . . and again, alike in vain,"
1170,THE SEPARATION.,{42}
1171,THE SEPARATION.,And with a louder cry
1172,THE SEPARATION.,"Straining its tone to hoarseness; . . . far away,"
1173,THE SEPARATION.,"Selfish in misery,"
1174,THE SEPARATION.,He heard the call and faster did he fly.
1175,THE SEPARATION.,
1176,THE SEPARATION.,10.
1177,THE SEPARATION.,She leans against that tree whose jutting bough
1178,THE SEPARATION.,Smote her so rudely. Her poor heart
1179,THE SEPARATION.,"How audibly it panted,"
1180,THE SEPARATION.,With sudden stop and start:
1181,THE SEPARATION.,Her breath how short and painfully it came!
1182,THE SEPARATION.,"Hark! all is still around her, . . ."
1183,THE SEPARATION.,"And the night so utterly dark,"
1184,THE SEPARATION.,"She opened her eyes and she closed them,"
1185,THE SEPARATION.,And the blackness and blank were the same.
1186,THE SEPARATION.,
1187,THE SEPARATION.,11.
1188,THE SEPARATION.,"'Twas like a dream of horror, and she stood"
1189,THE SEPARATION.,Half doubting whether all indeed were true.
1190,THE SEPARATION.,"A Tyger's howl loud echoing through the wood,"
1191,THE SEPARATION.,"Rous'd her; the dreadful sound she knew,"
1192,THE SEPARATION.,And turn'd instinctively to what she feared.
1193,THE SEPARATION.,Far off the Tyger's hungry howl was heard;
1194,THE SEPARATION.,"A nearer horror met the maiden's view,"
1195,THE SEPARATION.,{43}
1196,THE SEPARATION.,"For right before her a dim form appear'd,"
1197,THE SEPARATION.,"A human form in that black night,"
1198,THE SEPARATION.,"Distinctly shaped by its own lurid light,"
1199,THE SEPARATION.,"Such light as the sickly moon is seen to shed,"
1200,THE SEPARATION.,"Through spell-rais'd fogs, a bloody baleful red."
1201,THE SEPARATION.,
1202,THE SEPARATION.,12.
1203,THE SEPARATION.,That Spectre fix'd his eyes upon her full;
1204,THE SEPARATION.,The light which shone in their accursed orbs
1205,THE SEPARATION.,"Was like a light from Hell,"
1206,THE SEPARATION.,"And it grew deeper, kindling with the view."
1207,THE SEPARATION.,She could not turn her sight
1208,THE SEPARATION.,"From that infernal gaze, which like a spell"
1209,THE SEPARATION.,"Bound her, and held her rooted to the ground."
1210,THE SEPARATION.,It palsied every power;
1211,THE SEPARATION.,Her limbs avail'd her not in that dread hour.
1212,THE SEPARATION.,"There was no moving thence,"
1213,THE SEPARATION.,"Thought, memory, sense were gone:"
1214,THE SEPARATION.,"She heard not now the Tyger's nearer cry,"
1215,THE SEPARATION.,"She thought not on her father now,"
1216,THE SEPARATION.,"Her cold heart's-blood ran back,"
1217,THE SEPARATION.,"Her hand lay senseless on the bough it clasp'd,"
1218,THE SEPARATION.,Her feet were motionless;
1219,THE SEPARATION.,Her fascinated eyes
1220,THE SEPARATION.,{44}
1221,THE SEPARATION.,"Like the stone eye-balls of a statue fix'd,"
1222,THE SEPARATION.,Yet conscious of the sight that blasted them.
1223,THE SEPARATION.,
1224,THE SEPARATION.,13.
1225,THE SEPARATION.,"The wind is abroad,"
1226,THE SEPARATION.,It opens the clouds;
1227,THE SEPARATION.,"Scattered before the gale,"
1228,THE SEPARATION.,"They skurry through the sky,"
1229,THE SEPARATION.,And the darkness retiring rolls over the vale.
1230,THE SEPARATION.,"The stars in their beauty come forth on high,"
1231,THE SEPARATION.,And through the dark-blue night
1232,THE SEPARATION.,"The moon rides on triumphant, broad and bright."
1233,THE SEPARATION.,Distinct and darkening in her light
1234,THE SEPARATION.,Appears that Spectre foul.
1235,THE SEPARATION.,"The moon beam gives his face and form to sight,"
1236,THE SEPARATION.,"The shape of man,"
1237,THE SEPARATION.,The living form and face of Arvalan!
1238,THE SEPARATION.,His hands are spread to clasp her.
1239,THE SEPARATION.,
1240,THE SEPARATION.,14.
1241,THE SEPARATION.,But at that sight of dread the maid awoke;
1242,THE SEPARATION.,As if a lightning-stroke
1243,THE SEPARATION.,"Had burst the spell of fear,"
1244,THE SEPARATION.,Away she broke all franticly and fled.
1245,THE SEPARATION.,{45}
1246,THE SEPARATION.,"There stood a temple near beside the way,"
1247,THE SEPARATION.,"An open fane of Pollear, gentle God,"
1248,THE SEPARATION.,To whom the travellers for protection pray.
1249,THE SEPARATION.,"With elephantine head and eye severe,"
1250,THE SEPARATION.,"Here stood his image, such as when he seiz'd"
1251,THE SEPARATION.,"And tore the rebel giant from the ground,"
1252,THE SEPARATION.,With mighty trunk wreath'd round
1253,THE SEPARATION.,"His impotent bulk, and on his tusks, on high"
1254,THE SEPARATION.,Impal'd upheld him between earth and sky.
1255,THE SEPARATION.,
1256,THE SEPARATION.,15.
1257,THE SEPARATION.,"Thither the affrighted maiden sped her flight,"
1258,THE SEPARATION.,And she hath reach'd the place of sanctuary;
1259,THE SEPARATION.,"And now within the temple in despite,"
1260,THE SEPARATION.,"Yea, even before the altar, in his sight,"
1261,THE SEPARATION.,Hath Arvalan with fleshly arm of might
1262,THE SEPARATION.,Seiz'd her. That instant the insulted God
1263,THE SEPARATION.,"Caught him aloft, and from his sinuous grasp,"
1264,THE SEPARATION.,"As if from some tort catapult let loose,"
1265,THE SEPARATION.,Over the forest hurl'd him all abroad.
1266,THE SEPARATION.,
1267,THE SEPARATION.,16.
1268,THE SEPARATION.,"Overcome with dread,"
1269,THE SEPARATION.,She tarried not to see what heavenly power
1270,THE SEPARATION.,{46}
1271,THE SEPARATION.,Had saved her in that hour.
1272,THE SEPARATION.,Breathless and faint she fled.
1273,THE SEPARATION.,And now her foot struck on the knotted root
1274,THE SEPARATION.,"Of a broad manchineil, and there the maid"
1275,THE SEPARATION.,Fell senselessly beneath the deadly shade.

1757,EREENIA.,"A strong controuling power their strife suspended,"
1758,EREENIA.,"And there their hostile essences they blended,"
1759,EREENIA.,To form a Palace worthy of the God.
1760,EREENIA.,Built on the Lake the waters were its floor;
1761,EREENIA.,"And here its walls were water arch'd with fire,"
1762,EREENIA.,And here were fire with water vaulted o'er;
1763,EREENIA.,And spires and pinnacles of fire
1764,EREENIA.,"Round watery cupolas aspire,"
1765,EREENIA.,And domes of rainbow rest on fiery towers;
1766,EREENIA.,{67}
1767,EREENIA.,And roofs of flame are turreted around
1768,EREENIA.,"With cloud, and shafts of cloud with flame are bound."
1769,EREENIA.,"Here, too, the Elements for ever veer,"
1770,EREENIA.,Ranging around with endless interchanging;
1771,EREENIA.,"Pursued in love, and so in love pursuing,"
1772,EREENIA.,In endless revolutions here they roll;
1773,EREENIA.,"For ever their mysterious work renewing,"
1774,EREENIA.,"The parts all shifting, still unchanged the whole."
1775,EREENIA.,"Even we on earth, at intervals, descry"
1776,EREENIA.,"Gleams of the glory, streaks of flowing light,"
1777,EREENIA.,"Openings of heaven, and streams that flash at night"
1778,EREENIA.,"In fitful splendour, through the northern sky."

1780,EREENIA.,10.
1781,EREENIA.,"Impatient of delay, Ereenia caught"
1782,EREENIA.,"The Maid aloft, and spread his wings abroad,"
1783,EREENIA.,And bore her to the presence of the God.
1784,EREENIA.,"There Indra sate upon his throne reclin'd,"
1785,EREENIA.,Where Devetas adore him;
1786,EREENIA.,"The lute of Nared, warbling on the wind,"
1787,EREENIA.,All tones of magic harmony combin'd
1788,EREENIA.,"To sooth his troubled mind,"
1789,EREENIA.,While the dark-eyed Apsaras danced before him.
1790,EREENIA.,"In vain the God-musician played,"
1791,EREENIA.,{68}
1792,EREENIA.,In vain the dark-eyed Nymphs of Heaven essay'd
1793,EREENIA.,To charm him with their beauties in the dance;
1794,EREENIA.,"And when he saw the mortal Maid appear,"
1795,EREENIA.,"Led by the heroic Glendoveer,"
1796,EREENIA.,A deeper trouble fill'd his countenance.
1797,EREENIA.,"What hast thou done, Ereenia, said the God,"
1798,EREENIA.,Bringing a mortal here?
1799,EREENIA.,And while he spake his eye was on the Maid.
1800,EREENIA.,"The look he gave was solemn, not severe;"
1801,EREENIA.,"No hope to Kailyal it convey'd,"
1802,EREENIA.,And yet it struck no fear;
1803,EREENIA.,"There was a sad displeasure in his air,"
1804,EREENIA.,"But pity, too, was there."
1805,EREENIA.,
1806,EREENIA.,EREENIA.
1807,EREENIA.,"Hear me, O Indra! On the lower earth"
1808,EREENIA.,"I found this child of man, by what mishap"
1809,EREENIA.,"I know not, lying in the lap of death."
1810,EREENIA.,Aloft I bore her to our Father's grove;
1811,EREENIA.,"Not having other thought, than when the gales"
1812,EREENIA.,"Of bliss had heal'd her, upon earth again"
1813,EREENIA.,To leave its lovely daughter. Other thoughts
1814,EREENIA.,"Arose, when Casyapa declar'd her fate;"
1815,EREENIA.,For she is one who groans beneath the power
1816,EREENIA.,{69}
1817,EREENIA.,"Of the dread Rajah, terrible alike"
1818,EREENIA.,"To men and Gods. His son, dead Arvalan,"
1819,EREENIA.,"Arm'd with a portion, Indra, of thy power"
1820,EREENIA.,"Already wrested from thee, persecutes"
1821,EREENIA.,"The Maid, the helpless one, the innocent."
1822,EREENIA.,What then behov'd me but to waft her here
1823,EREENIA.,To my own Bower of Bliss? what other choice?
1824,EREENIA.,"The spirit of foul Arvalan, not yet"
1825,EREENIA.,Hath power to enter here; here thou art yet
1826,EREENIA.,"Supreme, and yet the Swerga is thine own."
1827,EREENIA.,
1828,INDRA.,INDRA.
1829,INDRA.,"No child of man, Ereenia, in the Bowers"
1830,INDRA.,"Of Bliss may sojourn, till he hath put off"
1831,INDRA.,His mortal part; for on mortality
1832,INDRA.,"Time and Infirmity and Death attend,"
1833,INDRA.,"Close followers they, and in their mournful train"
1834,INDRA.,Sorrow and Pain and Mutability:
1835,INDRA.,"Did they find entrance here, we should behold"
1836,INDRA.,"Our joys, like earthly summers, pass away."
1837,INDRA.,Those joys perchance may pass; a stronger hand
1838,INDRA.,"May wrest my sceptre, and unparadise"
1839,INDRA.,"The Swerga; . . . but, Ereenia, if we fall,"
1840,INDRA.,"Let it be Fate's own arm that casts us down,"
1841,INDRA.,{70}
1842,INDRA.,We will not rashly hasten and provoke
1843,INDRA.,"The blow, nor bring ourselves the ruin on."

1845,EREENIA.,EREENIA.
1846,EREENIA.,Fear courts the blow. Fear brings the ruin on.
1847,EREENIA.,Needs must the chariot-wheels of Destiny

1849,EREENIA.,Patient and prostrate.
1850,EREENIA.,
1851,INDRA.,INDRA.
1852,INDRA.,All may yet be well.
1853,INDRA.,"Who knows but Veeshnoo will descend, and save,"

1855,INDRA.,
1856,EREENIA.,EREENIA.
1857,EREENIA.,"Look not there for help,"
1858,EREENIA.,Nor build on unsubstantial hope thy trust!
1859,EREENIA.,Our Father Casyapa hath said he turns
1860,EREENIA.,"His doubtful eyes to Seeva, even as thou"
1861,EREENIA.,Dost look to him for aid. But thine own strength
1862,EREENIA.,Should for thine own salvation be put forth;
1863,EREENIA.,Then might the higher powers approving see
1864,EREENIA.,"And bless the brave resolve . . . Oh, that my arm"
1865,EREENIA.,"Could wield yon lightnings which play idly there,"
1866,EREENIA.,{71}
1867,EREENIA.,"In inoffensive radiance, round thy head!"
1868,EREENIA.,"The Swerga should not need a champion now,"
1869,EREENIA.,Nor Earth implore deliverance still in vain!
1870,EREENIA.,
1871,INDRA.,INDRA.
1872,INDRA.,"Thinkest thou I want the will? rash Son of Heaven,"
1873,INDRA.,What if my arm be feeble as thine own
1874,INDRA.,Against the dread Kehama? He went on
1875,INDRA.,"Conquering in irresistible career,"
1876,INDRA.,Till his triumphant car had measur'd o'er
1877,INDRA.,"The insufficient earth, and all the kings"
1878,INDRA.,Of men received his yoke; then had he won
1879,INDRA.,"His will, to ride upon their necks elate,"
1880,INDRA.,And crown his conquests with the sacrifice
1881,INDRA.,"That should, to men and gods, proclaim him Lord"
1882,INDRA.,"And Sovereign Master of the vassal World,"
1883,INDRA.,"Sole Rajah, the Omnipotent below."
1884,INDRA.,The steam of that portentous sacrifice
1885,INDRA.,Arose to Heaven. Then was the hour to strike.
1886,INDRA.,"Then in the consummation of his pride,"
1887,INDRA.,"His height of glory, then the thunder-bolt"
1888,INDRA.,"Should have gone forth, and hurl'd him from his throne"
1889,INDRA.,"Down to the fiery floor of Padalon,"
1890,INDRA.,"To everlasting burnings, agony"
1891,INDRA.,{72}
1892,INDRA.,"Eternal, and remorse which knows no end."
1893,INDRA.,"That hour went by: grown impious in success,"
1894,INDRA.,By prayer and penances he wrested now
1895,INDRA.,"Such power from Fate, that soon, if Seeva turn not"
1896,INDRA.,"His eyes on earth, and no Avatar save,"
1897,INDRA.,"Soon will he seize the Swerga for his own,"
1898,INDRA.,"Roll on through Padalon his chariot wheels,"
1899,INDRA.,Tear up the adamantine bolts which lock
1900,INDRA.,"The accurst Asuras to its burning floor,"
1901,INDRA.,And force the drink of Immortality
1902,INDRA.,From Yamen's charge . . . Vain were it now to strive;
1903,INDRA.,My thunder cannot pierce the sphere of power
1904,INDRA.,"Wherewith, as with a girdle, he is bound."
1905,INDRA.,
1906,KAILYAL.,KAILYAL.
1907,KAILYAL.,"Take me to earth, O gentle Deveta!"
1908,KAILYAL.,Take me again to earth! This is no place

1910,KAILYAL.,His curse . . . he shall not bear it all alone;
1911,KAILYAL.,"Take me to earth, that I may follow him! . . ."
1912,KAILYAL.,I do not fear the Almighty Man! the Gods

1924,KAILYAL.,And fixing on the guardian Glendoveer
1925,KAILYAL.,"Her eyes, more eloquent than Angel's tongue,"
1926,KAILYAL.,"Again she cried, There is no comfort here!"

1931,KAILYAL.,Indra with admiration heard the maid.

2079,THE SACRIFICE.,"That, instant from the crowd, with sudden shout,"

2115,THE SACRIFICE.,Call'd on the insulted Gods to save mankind.
2116,THE SACRIFICE.,"Expecting some new crime in fear they stood,"
2117,THE SACRIFICE.,Some horror which would make the natural blood

2163,THE HOME-SCENE.,The steam of slaughter from that place of blood
2164,THE HOME-SCENE.,Spread o'er the tainted sky.
2165,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Vultures, for whom the Rajah's tyranny"
2166,THE HOME-SCENE.,"So oft had furnish'd food, from far and nigh"
2167,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Sped to the lure: aloft with joyful cry,"
2168,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Wheeling around, they hover'd over head;"
2169,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Or, on the temple perch'd, with greedy eye,"
2170,THE HOME-SCENE.,Impatient watch'd the dead.
2171,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Far off the tygers, in the inmost wood,"
2172,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Heard the death-shriek, and snuff'd the scent of blood."
2173,THE HOME-SCENE.,"They rose, and through the covert went their way,"
2174,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Couch'd at the forest edge, and waited for their prey."

2180,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The hope which had inspir'd his heart was gone,"
2181,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Yet a wild joyance still inflam'd his face,"
2182,THE HOME-SCENE.,"A smile of vengeance, a triumphant glow."
2183,THE HOME-SCENE.,Where goes he? . . . Whither should Ladurlad go!
2184,THE HOME-SCENE.,Unwittingly the wretch's footsteps trace
2185,THE HOME-SCENE.,Their wonted path toward his dwelling-place;
2186,THE HOME-SCENE.,"And wandering on, unknowing where,"
2187,THE HOME-SCENE.,He starts at finding he is there.
2188,THE HOME-SCENE.,
2189,THE HOME-SCENE.,3.
2190,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Behold his lowly home,"
2191,THE HOME-SCENE.,By yonder broad-bough'd plane o'ershaded:
2192,THE HOME-SCENE.,"There Marriataly's image stands,"
2193,THE HOME-SCENE.,And there the garland twin'd by Kailyal's hands
2194,THE HOME-SCENE.,Around its brow hath faded.
2195,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The Peacocks, at their master's sight,"
2196,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Quick from the leafy thatch alight,"
2197,THE HOME-SCENE.,"And hurry round, and search the ground,"
2198,THE HOME-SCENE.,"And veer their glancing necks from side to side,"
2199,THE HOME-SCENE.,Expecting from his hand
2200,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Their daily dole, which erst the maid supplied,"

2208,THE HOME-SCENE.,How differently did each familiar sound
2209,THE HOME-SCENE.,Assail his altered ear!
2210,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Here stood the marriage bower,"
2211,THE HOME-SCENE.,Rear'd in that happy hour
2212,THE HOME-SCENE.,"When he, with festal joy and youthful pride,"
2213,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Had brought Yedillian home, his beauteous bride."
2214,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Leaves not its own, and many a borrowed flower,"
2215,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Had then bedeck'd it, withering ere the night;"
2216,THE HOME-SCENE.,"But he who look'd, from that auspicious day,"
2217,THE HOME-SCENE.,"For years of long delight,"
2218,THE HOME-SCENE.,"And would not see the marriage-bower decay,"
2219,THE HOME-SCENE.,"There planted and nurst up, with daily care,"
2220,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The sweetest herbs that scent the ambient air,"
2221,THE HOME-SCENE.,And train'd them round to live and flourish there.
2222,THE HOME-SCENE.,Nor when dread Yamen's will
2223,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Had call'd Yedillian from his arms away,"
2224,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Ceas'd he to tend the marriage-bower, but still,"
2225,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Sorrowing, had drest it like a pious rite"
2226,THE HOME-SCENE.,Due to the monument of past delight.
2227,THE HOME-SCENE.,
2228,THE HOME-SCENE.,5.
2229,THE HOME-SCENE.,"He took his wonted seat before the door, . . ."
2230,THE HOME-SCENE.,{86}
2231,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Even as of yore,"
2232,THE HOME-SCENE.,"When he was wont to view, with placid eyes,"
2233,THE HOME-SCENE.,His daughter at her evening sacrifice.
2234,THE HOME-SCENE.,Here were the flowers which she so carefully
2235,THE HOME-SCENE.,Did love to rear for Marriataly's brow;
2236,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Neglected now,"
2237,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Their heavy heads were drooping, over-blown:"
2238,THE HOME-SCENE.,"All else appeared the same as heretofore,"
2239,THE HOME-SCENE.,All . . . save himself alone;
2240,THE HOME-SCENE.,"How happy then, . . . and now a wretch for evermore!"
2241,THE HOME-SCENE.,
2242,THE HOME-SCENE.,6.
2243,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The market-flag which hoisted high,"
2244,THE HOME-SCENE.,"From far and nigh,"
2245,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Above yon cocoa grove is seen,"
2246,THE HOME-SCENE.,Hangs motionless amid the sultry sky.
2247,THE HOME-SCENE.,Loud sounds the village-drum: a happy crowd
2248,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Is there; Ladurlad hears their distant voices,"
2249,THE HOME-SCENE.,But with their joy no more his heart rejoices;
2250,THE HOME-SCENE.,"And how their old companion now may fare,"
2251,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Little they know, and less they care."
2252,THE HOME-SCENE.,The torment he is doom'd to hear
2253,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Was but to them the wonder of a day,"
2254,THE HOME-SCENE.,A burthen of sad thoughts soon put away.

2259,THE HOME-SCENE.,"They knew not that the wretched man was near,"
2260,THE HOME-SCENE.,"And yet it seem'd, to his distempered ear,"
2261,THE HOME-SCENE.,As if they wrong'd him with their merriment.
2262,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Resentfully he turn'd away his eyes,"
2263,THE HOME-SCENE.,Yet turn'd them but to find
2264,THE HOME-SCENE.,Sights that enraged his mind
2265,THE HOME-SCENE.,With envious grief more wild and overpowering.
2266,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The tank which fed his fields was there, and there"
2267,THE HOME-SCENE.,The large-leav'd lotus on the waters flowering.
2268,THE HOME-SCENE.,"There, from the intolerable heat,"
2269,THE HOME-SCENE.,The buffaloes retreat;
2270,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Only their nostrils rais'd to meet the air,"
2271,THE HOME-SCENE.,Amid the sheltering element they rest.
2272,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Impatient of the sight, he clos'd his eyes,"
2273,THE HOME-SCENE.,"And bow'd his burning head, and in despair"
2274,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Calling on Indra, . . . Thunder-God! he said,"
2275,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Thou owest to me alone this day thy throne,"
2276,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Be grateful, and in mercy strike me dead!"
2277,THE HOME-SCENE.,
2278,THE HOME-SCENE.,8.
2279,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Despair had rous'd him to that hopeless prayer,"
2280,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Yet thinking on the heavenly Powers, his mind"
2281,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Drew comfort; and he rose and gather'd flowers,"
2282,THE HOME-SCENE.,{88}
2283,THE HOME-SCENE.,And twin'd a crown for Marriataly's brow;
2284,THE HOME-SCENE.,"And taking then her withered garland down,"
2285,THE HOME-SCENE.,Replaced it with the blooming coronal.
2286,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Not for myself, the unhappy Father cried,"
2287,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Not for myself, O mighty one! I pray,"
2288,THE HOME-SCENE.,Accursed as I am beyond thy aid!
2289,THE HOME-SCENE.,"But, oh! be gracious still to that dear Maid"
2290,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Who crown'd thee with these garlands day by day,"
2291,THE HOME-SCENE.,And danced before thee aye at even-tide
2292,THE HOME-SCENE.,In beauty and in pride.
2293,THE HOME-SCENE.,"O Marriataly, wheresoe'er she stray"
2294,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Forlorn and wretched, still be thou her guide!"
2295,THE HOME-SCENE.,
2296,THE HOME-SCENE.,9.
2297,THE HOME-SCENE.,"A loud and fiendish laugh replied,"
2298,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Scoffing his prayer. Aloft, as from the air,"
2299,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The sound of insult came: he look'd, and there"
2300,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The visage of dead Arvalan came forth,"
2301,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Only his face amid the clear blue sky,"
2302,THE HOME-SCENE.,"With long-drawn lips of insolent mockery,"
2303,THE HOME-SCENE.,And eyes whose lurid glare
2304,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Was like a sulphur fire,"
2305,THE HOME-SCENE.,Mingling with darkness ere its flames expire.
2306,THE HOME-SCENE.,
2307,THE HOME-SCENE.,{89}
2308,THE HOME-SCENE.,
2309,THE HOME-SCENE.,10.
2310,THE HOME-SCENE.,Ladurlad knew him well: enraged to see
2311,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The cause of all his misery,"
2312,THE HOME-SCENE.,He stoop'd and lifted from the ground
2313,THE HOME-SCENE.,"A stake, whose fatal point was black with blood;"
2314,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The same wherewith his hand had dealt the wound,"
2315,THE HOME-SCENE.,"When Arvalan, in hour with evil fraught,"
2316,THE HOME-SCENE.,For violation seiz'd the shrieking Maid.
2317,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Thus arm'd, in act again to strike he stood,"
2318,THE HOME-SCENE.,And twice with inefficient wrath essay'd
2319,THE HOME-SCENE.,To smite the impassive shade.
2320,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The lips of scorn their mockery-laugh renew'd,"
2321,THE HOME-SCENE.,And Arvalan put forth a hand and caught
2322,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The sun-beam, and condensing there its light,"
2323,THE HOME-SCENE.,Upon Ladurlad turn'd the burning stream.
2324,THE HOME-SCENE.,Vain cruelty! the stake
2325,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Fell in white ashes from his hold, but he"
2326,THE HOME-SCENE.,Endur'd no added pain; his agony
2327,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Was full, and at the height;"
2328,THE HOME-SCENE.,The burning stream of radiance nothing harm'd him:
2329,THE HOME-SCENE.,"A fire was in his heart and brain,"
2330,THE HOME-SCENE.,And from all other flame
2331,THE HOME-SCENE.,Kehama's Curse had charm'd him.

2333,THE HOME-SCENE.,{90}
2334,THE HOME-SCENE.,

2336,THE HOME-SCENE.,Anon the Spirit wav'd a second hand;
2337,THE HOME-SCENE.,Down rush'd the obedient whirlwind from the sky;
2338,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Scoop'd up the sand like smoke, and from on high"
2339,THE HOME-SCENE.,Shed the hot shower upon Ladurlad's head.
2340,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Where'er he turns, the accursed Hand is there;"
2341,THE HOME-SCENE.,"East, West, and North and South, on every side"
2342,THE HOME-SCENE.,The Hand accursed waves in air to guide
2343,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The dizzying storm; ears, nostrils, eyes and mouth,"
2344,THE HOME-SCENE.,"It fills and choaks, and, clogging every pore,"
2345,THE HOME-SCENE.,Taught him new torments might be yet in store.
2346,THE HOME-SCENE.,Where shall he turn to fly? behold his house
2347,THE HOME-SCENE.,"In flames; uprooted lies the marriage-bower,"
2348,THE HOME-SCENE.,The Goddess buried by the sandy shower.
2349,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Blindly, with staggering step, he reels about,"
2350,THE HOME-SCENE.,"And still the accursed Hand pursued,"
2351,THE HOME-SCENE.,And still the lips of scorn their mockery laugh renew'd.
2352,THE HOME-SCENE.,
2353,THE HOME-SCENE.,12.
2354,THE HOME-SCENE.,"What, Arvalan! hast thou so soon forgot"
2355,THE HOME-SCENE.,The grasp of Pollear? Wilt thou still defy
2356,THE HOME-SCENE.,The righteous Powers of Heaven? or know'st thou not
2357,THE HOME-SCENE.,"That there are yet superior Powers on high,"
2358,THE HOME-SCENE.,{91}
2359,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Son of the Wicked? . . . Lo, in rapid flight,"
2360,THE HOME-SCENE.,Ereenia hastens from the etherial height;
2361,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Bright is the sword celestial in his hand,"
2362,THE HOME-SCENE.,Like lightning in its path athwart the sky.
2363,THE HOME-SCENE.,"He comes and drives, with angel-arm, the blow."
2364,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Oft have the Asuras, in the wars of Heaven,"
2365,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Felt that keen sword by arm angelic driven,"
2366,THE HOME-SCENE.,And fled before it from the fields of light.
2367,THE HOME-SCENE.,Thrice through the vulnerable shade
2368,THE HOME-SCENE.,The Glendoveer impels the griding blade.
2369,THE HOME-SCENE.,The wicked Shade flies howling from his foe.
2370,THE HOME-SCENE.,So let that spirit foul
2371,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Fly, and for impotence of anger, howl,"
2372,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Writhing with pain, and o'er his wounds deplore;"
2373,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Worse punishment hath Arvalan deserv'd,"
2374,THE HOME-SCENE.,And righteous Fate hath heavier doom in store.
2375,THE HOME-SCENE.,
2376,THE HOME-SCENE.,13.
2377,THE HOME-SCENE.,Not now the Glendoveer pursued his flight.
2378,THE HOME-SCENE.,"He bade the Ship of Heaven alight,"
2379,THE HOME-SCENE.,And gently there he laid
2380,THE HOME-SCENE.,"The astonished Father by the happy Maid,"
2381,THE HOME-SCENE.,The Maid now shedding tears of deep delight.
2382,THE HOME-SCENE.,{92}
2383,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Beholding all things with incredulous eyes,"
2384,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Still dizzy with the sand-storm, there he lay,"
2385,THE HOME-SCENE.,"While sailing up the skies, the living Bark,"
2386,THE HOME-SCENE.,"Through air and sunshine, held its heavenly way."

2419,MOUNT MERU.,"When Parvati presumed to lay,"
2420,MOUNT MERU.,"In wanton play,"

2508,MOUNT MERU.,"Beheld them with benignant eye,"

2511,MOUNT MERU.,And welcome their beloved feet.
2512,MOUNT MERU.,"The gales of Swerga thither fled,"
2513,MOUNT MERU.,And heavenly odours there were shed
2514,MOUNT MERU.,"About, below, and overhead;"

2531,MOUNT MERU.,Pure dwelling-place for perfect mind.

2533,MOUNT MERU.,She stood and gaz'd on sire and child;
2534,MOUNT MERU.,"Her tongue not yet had power to speak,"
2535,MOUNT MERU.,The tears were streaming down her cheek;
2536,MOUNT MERU.,"And when those tears her sight beguil'd,"

2547,MOUNT MERU.,"A sudden thrill, a startling thought,"
2548,MOUNT MERU.,"A feeling many a year forgot,"
2549,MOUNT MERU.,"Now like a dream anew recurring,"
2550,MOUNT MERU.,As if again in every vein
2551,MOUNT MERU.,Her mother's milk was stirring.
2552,MOUNT MERU.,With straining neck and earnest eye
2553,MOUNT MERU.,"She stretch'd her hands imploringly,"
2554,MOUNT MERU.,"As if she fain would have her nigh,"
2555,MOUNT MERU.,"Yet fear'd to meet the wish'd embrace,"
2556,MOUNT MERU.,"At once with love and awe opprest,"
2557,MOUNT MERU.,{100}
2558,MOUNT MERU.,"Not so, Ladurlad; he could trace,"
2559,MOUNT MERU.,"Though brighten'd with angelic grace,"
2560,MOUNT MERU.,His own Yedillian's earthly face;
2561,MOUNT MERU.,He ran and held her to his breast!
2562,MOUNT MERU.,"Oh joy above all joys of Heaven,"
2563,MOUNT MERU.,"By Death alone to others given,"
2564,MOUNT MERU.,This moment hath to him restor'd
2565,MOUNT MERU.,"The early-lost, the long-deplor'd."
2566,MOUNT MERU.,
2567,MOUNT MERU.,9.
2568,MOUNT MERU.,They sin who tell us love can die.
2569,MOUNT MERU.,"With life all other passions fly,"
2570,MOUNT MERU.,All others are but vanity.
2571,MOUNT MERU.,"In Heaven Ambition cannot dwell,"
2572,MOUNT MERU.,Nor Avarice in the vaults of Hell;
2573,MOUNT MERU.,"Earthly these passions of the Earth,"
2574,MOUNT MERU.,They perish where they have their birth;
2575,MOUNT MERU.,But Love is indestructible.
2576,MOUNT MERU.,"Its holy flame for ever burneth,"
2577,MOUNT MERU.,"From Heaven it came, to Heaven returneth;"
2578,MOUNT MERU.,"Too oft on Earth a troubled guest,"
2579,MOUNT MERU.,"At times deceiv'd, at times opprest,"
2580,MOUNT MERU.,"It here is tried and purified,"
2581,MOUNT MERU.,Then hath in Heaven its perfect rest:
2582,MOUNT MERU.,{101}
2583,MOUNT MERU.,"It soweth here with toil and care,"
2584,MOUNT MERU.,But the harvest-time of Love is there.
2585,MOUNT MERU.,Oh! when a Mother meets on high
2586,MOUNT MERU.,"The Babe she lost in infancy,"
2587,MOUNT MERU.,"Hath she not then, for pains and fears,"
2588,MOUNT MERU.,"The day of woe, the watchful night,"
2589,MOUNT MERU.,"For all her sorrow, all her tears,"
2590,MOUNT MERU.,An over-payment of delight!
2591,MOUNT MERU.,
2592,MOUNT MERU.,10.
2593,MOUNT MERU.,A blessed family is this
2594,MOUNT MERU.,Assembled in the Bower of Bliss!
2595,MOUNT MERU.,"Strange woe, Ladurlad, hath been thine,"
2596,MOUNT MERU.,"And pangs beyond all human measure,"
2597,MOUNT MERU.,"And thy reward is now divine,"
2598,MOUNT MERU.,A foretaste of eternal pleasure.
2599,MOUNT MERU.,He knew indeed there was a day
2600,MOUNT MERU.,"When all these joys would pass away,"
2601,MOUNT MERU.,And he must quit this blest abode;
2602,MOUNT MERU.,"And, taking up again the spell,"
2603,MOUNT MERU.,"Groan underneath the baleful load,"
2604,MOUNT MERU.,And wander o'er the world again
2605,MOUNT MERU.,Most wretched of the sons of men:
2606,MOUNT MERU.,"Yet was this brief repose, as when"
2607,MOUNT MERU.,{102}
2608,MOUNT MERU.,"A traveller in the Arabian sands,"
2609,MOUNT MERU.,"Half-fainting on his sultry road,"
2610,MOUNT MERU.,Hath reach'd the water-place at last;
2611,MOUNT MERU.,"And resting there beside the Well,"
2612,MOUNT MERU.,"Thinks of the perils he has past,"
2613,MOUNT MERU.,"And gazes o'er the unbounded plain,"
2614,MOUNT MERU.,"The plain which must be travers'd still,"
2615,MOUNT MERU.,"And drinks, . . . yet cannot drink his fill;"
2616,MOUNT MERU.,Then girds his patient loins again.
2617,MOUNT MERU.,So to Ladurlad now was given
2618,MOUNT MERU.,"New strength, and confidence in Heaven,"
2619,MOUNT MERU.,"And hope, and faith invincible."
2620,MOUNT MERU.,For often would Ereenia tell
2621,MOUNT MERU.,"Of what in elder days befell,"
2622,MOUNT MERU.,"When other Tyrants, in their might,"
2623,MOUNT MERU.,Usurp'd dominion o'er the earth;
2624,MOUNT MERU.,"And Veeshnoo took a human birth,"
2625,MOUNT MERU.,Deliverer of the Sons of men;
2626,MOUNT MERU.,"And slew the huge Ermaccasen,"
2627,MOUNT MERU.,"And piece-meal rent, with lion force,"
2628,MOUNT MERU.,"Errenen's accursed corse,"
2629,MOUNT MERU.,And humbled Baly in his pride;
2630,MOUNT MERU.,And when the Giant Ravanen
2631,MOUNT MERU.,"Had borne triumphant, from his side,"
2632,MOUNT MERU.,{103}
2633,MOUNT MERU.,"Sita, the earth-born God's beloved bride,"
2634,MOUNT MERU.,"Then, from his island-kingdom, laugh'd to scorn"
2635,MOUNT MERU.,"The insulted husband, and his power defied;"
2636,MOUNT MERU.,"How to revenge the wrong in wrath he hied,"
2637,MOUNT MERU.,"Bridging the sea before his dreadful way,"
2638,MOUNT MERU.,"And met the hundred-headed foe,"
2639,MOUNT MERU.,And dealt him the unerring blow;
2640,MOUNT MERU.,"By Brama's hand the righteous lance was given,"
2641,MOUNT MERU.,"And by that arm immortal driven,"
2642,MOUNT MERU.,It laid the mighty Tyrant low;
2643,MOUNT MERU.,"And Earth and Ocean, and high Heaven,"
2644,MOUNT MERU.,Rejoiced to see his overthrow.
2645,MOUNT MERU.,"Oh! doubt not thou, Yedillian cried,"
2646,MOUNT MERU.,Such fate Kehama will betide;
2647,MOUNT MERU.,For there are Gods who look below. . . .
2648,MOUNT MERU.,"Seeva, the Avenger, is not blind,"
2649,MOUNT MERU.,Nor Veeshnoo careless for mankind.
2650,MOUNT MERU.,
2651,MOUNT MERU.,11.
2652,MOUNT MERU.,Thus was Ladurlad's soul imbued
2653,MOUNT MERU.,With hope and holy fortitude;
2654,MOUNT MERU.,"And Child and Sire, with pious mind"
2655,MOUNT MERU.,"Alike resolv'd, alike resign'd,"
2656,MOUNT MERU.,Look'd onward to the evil day:
2657,MOUNT MERU.,{104}
2658,MOUNT MERU.,"Faith was their comfort, Faith their stay;"
2659,MOUNT MERU.,"They trusted woe would pass away,"
2660,MOUNT MERU.,"And Tyranny would sink subdued,"
2661,MOUNT MERU.,And Evil yield to Good.
2662,MOUNT MERU.,
2663,MOUNT MERU.,12.
2664,MOUNT MERU.,"Lovely wert thou, O Flower of Earth!"
2665,MOUNT MERU.,Above all flowers of mortal birth;
2666,MOUNT MERU.,But foster'd in this blissful bower
2667,MOUNT MERU.,"From day to day, and hour to hour,"
2668,MOUNT MERU.,Lovelier grew the lovely flower.
2669,MOUNT MERU.,"O blessed, blessed company!"
2670,MOUNT MERU.,"When men and heavenly spirits greet,"
2671,MOUNT MERU.,"And they whom Death had severed meet,"
2672,MOUNT MERU.,And hold again communion sweet; . . .
2673,MOUNT MERU.,"O blessed, blessed company!"
2674,MOUNT MERU.,"The Sun, careering round the sky,"
2675,MOUNT MERU.,"Beheld them with rejoicing eye,"
2676,MOUNT MERU.,And bade his willing Charioteer
2677,MOUNT MERU.,Relax their speed as they drew near;
2678,MOUNT MERU.,"Arounin check'd the rainbow reins,"
2679,MOUNT MERU.,"The seven green coursers shook their manes,"
2680,MOUNT MERU.,And brighter rays around them threw;
2681,MOUNT MERU.,The Car of glory in their view
2682,MOUNT MERU.,{105}
2683,MOUNT MERU.,"More radiant, more resplendent grew;"
2684,MOUNT MERU.,"And Surya, through his veil of light,"
2685,MOUNT MERU.,"Beheld the Bower, and blest the sight."
2686,MOUNT MERU.,"The Lord of Night, as he sail'd by,"
2687,MOUNT MERU.,Stay'd his pearly boat on high;
2688,MOUNT MERU.,"And, while around the blissful Bower"
2689,MOUNT MERU.,"He bade the softest moonlight flow,"
2690,MOUNT MERU.,"Lingered to see that earthly flower,"
2691,MOUNT MERU.,"Forgetful of his dragon foe,"
2692,MOUNT MERU.,"Who, mindful of their ancient feud,"
2693,MOUNT MERU.,With open jaws of rage pursued.
2694,MOUNT MERU.,"There all good Spirits of the air,"
2695,MOUNT MERU.,"Suras and Devetas repair,"
2696,MOUNT MERU.,Aloft they love to hover there
2697,MOUNT MERU.,"And view the flower of mortal birth,"
2698,MOUNT MERU.,"Here, for her innocence and worth,"
2699,MOUNT MERU.,Transplanted from the fields of earth; . . .
2700,MOUNT MERU.,"And him who, on the dreadful day"
2701,MOUNT MERU.,"When Heaven was fill'd with consternation,"
2702,MOUNT MERU.,"And Indra trembled with dismay,"
2703,MOUNT MERU.,"And, for the sounds of joy and mirth,"
2704,MOUNT MERU.,"Woe was heard and lamentation,"
2705,MOUNT MERU.,"Defied the Rajah in his pride,"
2706,MOUNT MERU.,Though all in Heaven and Earth beside
2707,MOUNT MERU.,Stood mute in dolorous expectation;
2708,MOUNT MERU.,{106}
2709,MOUNT MERU.,"And, rushing forward in that hour,"
2710,MOUNT MERU.,Saved the Swerga from his power.
2711,MOUNT MERU.,"Grateful for this they hover nigh,"
2712,MOUNT MERU.,And bless the blessed company.
2713,MOUNT MERU.,
2714,MOUNT MERU.,13.
2715,MOUNT MERU.,"One God alone, with wanton eye,"
2716,MOUNT MERU.,Beheld them in their bower;
2717,MOUNT MERU.,"O ye, he cried, who have defied"
2718,MOUNT MERU.,"The Rajah, will ye mock my power?"
2719,MOUNT MERU.,"'Twas Camdeo riding on his lory,"
2720,MOUNT MERU.,'Twas the immortal youth of Love;
2721,MOUNT MERU.,"If men below and Gods above,"
2722,MOUNT MERU.,"Subject alike, quoth he, have felt these darts,"
2723,MOUNT MERU.,"Shall ye alone, of all in story,"
2724,MOUNT MERU.,Boast impenetrable hearts?
2725,MOUNT MERU.,"Hover here, my gentle lory,"
2726,MOUNT MERU.,"Gently hover, while I see"
2727,MOUNT MERU.,"To whom hath Fate decreed the glory,"
2728,MOUNT MERU.,To the Glendoveer or me.
2729,MOUNT MERU.,
2730,MOUNT MERU.,14.
2731,MOUNT MERU.,"Then, in the dewy evening sky,"
2732,MOUNT MERU.,The bird of gorgeous plumery
2733,MOUNT MERU.,Pois'd his wings and hover'd nigh.
2734,MOUNT MERU.,{107}
2735,MOUNT MERU.,It chanced at that delightful hour
2736,MOUNT MERU.,"Kailyal sate before the Bower,"
2737,MOUNT MERU.,"On the green bank with amaranth sweet,"
2738,MOUNT MERU.,Where Ganges warbled at her feet.
2739,MOUNT MERU.,"Ereenia there, before the Maid,"
2740,MOUNT MERU.,His sails of ocean-blue displayed;
2741,MOUNT MERU.,"And sportive in her sight,"
2742,MOUNT MERU.,Mov'd slowly o'er the lake with gliding flight;
2743,MOUNT MERU.,"Anon, with sudden stroke and strong,"
2744,MOUNT MERU.,"In rapid course careering, swept along;"
2745,MOUNT MERU.,"Now shooting downward from his heavenly height,"
2746,MOUNT MERU.,"Plunged in the deep below,"
2747,MOUNT MERU.,"Then rising, soar'd again,"
2748,MOUNT MERU.,"And shook the sparkling waters off like rain,"
2749,MOUNT MERU.,And hovering o'er the silver surface hung.
2750,MOUNT MERU.,At him young Camdeo bent the bow;
2751,MOUNT MERU.,"With living bees the bow was strung,"
2752,MOUNT MERU.,"The fatal bow of sugar-cane,"
2753,MOUNT MERU.,And flowers which would inflame the heart
2754,MOUNT MERU.,With their petals barb'd the dart.
2755,MOUNT MERU.,
2756,MOUNT MERU.,15.
2757,MOUNT MERU.,"The shaft, unerringly addrest,"
2758,MOUNT MERU.,"Unerring flew, and smote Ereenia's breast."
2759,MOUNT MERU.,"Ah, Wanton! cried the Glendoveer,"
2760,MOUNT MERU.,{108}
2761,MOUNT MERU.,"Go aim at idler hearts,"
2762,MOUNT MERU.,Thy skill is baffled here!
2763,MOUNT MERU.,"A deeper love I bear that Maid divine,"
2764,MOUNT MERU.,"Sprung from a higher will,"
2765,MOUNT MERU.,A holier power than thine!
2766,MOUNT MERU.,"A second shaft, while thus Ereenia cried,"
2767,MOUNT MERU.,"Had Camdeo aim'd at Kailyal's side,"
2768,MOUNT MERU.,"But, lo! the Bees which strung his bow"
2769,MOUNT MERU.,"Broke off, and took their flight."
2770,MOUNT MERU.,"To that sweet Flower of earth they wing their way,"
2771,MOUNT MERU.,"Around her raven tresses play,"
2772,MOUNT MERU.,"And buzz about her with delight,"
2773,MOUNT MERU.,"As if, with that melodious sound,"
2774,MOUNT MERU.,They strove to pay their willing duty
2775,MOUNT MERU.,To mortal purity and beauty.
2776,MOUNT MERU.,"Ah, Wanton! cried the Glendoveer,"
2777,MOUNT MERU.,No power hast thou for mischief here!
2778,MOUNT MERU.,"Chuse thou some idler breast,"
2779,MOUNT MERU.,"For these are proof, by nobler thoughts possest."
2780,MOUNT MERU.,"Go, to thy plains of Matra go,"
2781,MOUNT MERU.,And string again thy broken bow!
2782,MOUNT MERU.,
2783,MOUNT MERU.,16.
2784,MOUNT MERU.,Rightly Ereenia spake; and ill had thoughts
2785,MOUNT MERU.,Of earthly love beseem'd the sanctuary
2786,MOUNT MERU.,{109}
2787,MOUNT MERU.,"Where Kailyal had been wafted, that the Soul"
2788,MOUNT MERU.,"Of her dead mother there might strengthen her,"
2789,MOUNT MERU.,Feeding her with the milk of heavenly lore;
2790,MOUNT MERU.,And influxes of Heaven imbue her heart
2791,MOUNT MERU.,"With hope and faith, and holy fortitude,"
2792,MOUNT MERU.,Against the evil day. Here rest a while
2793,MOUNT MERU.,"In peace, O Father! mark'd for misery"
2794,MOUNT MERU.,Above all sons of men; O Daughter! doom'd
2795,MOUNT MERU.,For sufferings and for trials above all
2796,MOUNT MERU.,"Of women; . . . yet both favour'd, both belov'd"
2797,MOUNT MERU.,"By all good Powers, here rest a while in peace."

2804,THE ENCHANTRESS.,{110}
2805,THE ENCHANTRESS.,
2806,THE ENCHANTRESS.,1.
2807,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"When from the sword, by arm angelic driven,"
2808,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Foul Arvalan fled howling, wild in pain,"
2809,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"His thin essential spirit, rent and riven"
2810,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"With wounds, united soon and heal'd again;"
2811,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Backward the accursed turn'd his eye in flight,"
2812,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Remindful of revengeful thoughts even then,"
2813,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And saw where, gliding through the evening light,"
2814,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"The Ship of Heaven sail'd upward through the sky,"
2815,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Then, like a meteor, vanish'd from his sight."
2816,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Where should he follow? vainly might he try
2817,THE ENCHANTRESS.,To trace through trackless air its rapid course;
2818,THE ENCHANTRESS.,{111}
2819,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Nor dar'd he that; angelic arm defy,"
2820,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Still sore and writhing from its dreaded force.
2821,THE ENCHANTRESS.,
2822,THE ENCHANTRESS.,2.
2823,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Should he the lust of vengeance lay aside?
2824,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Too long had Arvalan in ill been train'd;
2825,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Nurst up in power and tyranny and pride,"
2826,THE ENCHANTRESS.,His soul the ignominious thought disdain'd.
2827,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Or to his mighty father should he go,"
2828,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Complaining of defeature twice sustain'd,"
2829,THE ENCHANTRESS.,And ask new powers to meet the immortal foe? . . .
2830,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Repulse he fear'd not, but he fear'd rebuke,"
2831,THE ENCHANTRESS.,And sham'd to tell him of his overthrow.
2832,THE ENCHANTRESS.,There dwelt a dread Enchantress in a nook
2833,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Obscure; old help-mate she to him had been,"
2834,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Lending her aid in many a secret sin;
2835,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And there, for counsel, now his way he took."
2836,THE ENCHANTRESS.,
2837,THE ENCHANTRESS.,3.
2838,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"She was a woman whose unlovely youth,"
2839,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Even like a cankered rose, which none will cull,"
2840,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Had withered on the stalk; her heart was full
2841,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Of passions which had found no natural scope,"
2842,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Feelings which there had grown but ripened not;
2843,THE ENCHANTRESS.,{112}
2844,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Desires unsatisfied, abortive hope,"
2845,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Repinings which provoked vindictive thought,"
2846,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"These restless elements for ever wrought,"
2847,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Fermenting in her with perpetual stir,"
2848,THE ENCHANTRESS.,And thus her spirit to all evil mov'd;
2849,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"She hated men because they lov'd not her,"
2850,THE ENCHANTRESS.,And hated women because they were lov'd.
2851,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And thus, in wrath and hatred and despair,"
2852,THE ENCHANTRESS.,She tempted Hell to tempt her; and resign'd
2853,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Her body to the Demons of the Air,"
2854,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Wicked and wanton fiends who, where they will,"
2855,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Wander abroad, still seeking to do ill,"
2856,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And take whatever vacant form they find,"
2857,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Carcase of man or beast, that life hath left;"
2858,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Foul instrument for them of fouler mind.
2859,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"To these the Witch her wretched body gave,"
2860,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"So they would wreak her vengeance on mankind,"
2861,THE ENCHANTRESS.,She thus at once their mistress and their slave;
2862,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And they, to do such service nothing loth,"
2863,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Obeyed her bidding, slaves and masters both."
2864,THE ENCHANTRESS.,
2865,THE ENCHANTRESS.,4.
2866,THE ENCHANTRESS.,So from this cursed intercourse she caught
2867,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Contagious power of mischief, and was taught"
2868,THE ENCHANTRESS.,{113}
2869,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Such secrets as are damnable to guess.
2870,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Is there a child whose little lovely ways
2871,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Might win all hearts, . . . on whom his parents gaze"
2872,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Till they shed tears of joy and tenderness?
2873,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Oh! hide him from that Witch's withering sight!
2874,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Oh! hide him from the eye of Lorrinite!
2875,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Her look hath crippling in it, and her curse"
2876,THE ENCHANTRESS.,All plagues which on mortality can light;
2877,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Death is his doom if she behold, . . . or worse, . . ."
2878,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Diseases loathsome and incurable,"
2879,THE ENCHANTRESS.,And inward sufferings that no tongue can tell.
2880,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Woe was to him, on whom that eye of hate"
2881,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Was bent; for, certain as the stroke of Fate,"
2882,THE ENCHANTRESS.,It did its mortal work; nor human arts
2883,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Could save the unhappy wretch, her chosen prey;"
2884,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"For gazing, she consum'd his vital parts,"
2885,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Eating his very core of life away.
2886,THE ENCHANTRESS.,The wine which from yon wounded palm on high
2887,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Fills yonder gourd, as slowly it distills,"
2888,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Grows sour at once if Lorrinite pass by.
2889,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"The deadliest worm, from which all creatures fly,"
2890,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Fled from the deadlier venom of her eye;
2891,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"The babe unborn, within its mother's womb,"
2892,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Started and trembled when the Witch came nigh,"
2893,THE ENCHANTRESS.,{114}
2894,THE ENCHANTRESS.,And in the silent chambers of the tomb
2895,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Death shuddered her unholy tread to hear,"
2896,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And, from the dry and mouldering bones, did fear"
2897,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Force a cold sweat, when Lorrinite was near."
2898,THE ENCHANTRESS.,
2899,THE ENCHANTRESS.,5.
2900,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Power made her haughty: by ambition fir'd,"
2901,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Ere long to mightier mischiefs she aspir'd.
2902,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"The Calis, who o'er Cities rule unseen,"
2903,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Each in her own domain a Demon Queen,"
2904,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And there ador'd with blood and human life,"
2905,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"They knew her, and in their accurst employ"
2906,THE ENCHANTRESS.,She stirr'd up neighbouring states to mortal strife.
2907,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Sani, the dreadful God, who rides abroad"
2908,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Upon the King of the Ravens, to destroy"
2909,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"The offending sons of men, when his four hands"
2910,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Were weary with their toil, would let her do"
2911,THE ENCHANTRESS.,His work of vengeance upon guilty lands;
2912,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And Lorrinite, at his commandment, knew"
2913,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"When the ripe earthquake should be loos'd, and where"
2914,THE ENCHANTRESS.,To point its course. And in the baneful air
2915,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"The pregnant seeds of death he bade her strew,"
2916,THE ENCHANTRESS.,All deadly plagues and pestilence to brew.
2917,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"The Locusts were her army, and their bands,"
2918,THE ENCHANTRESS.,{115}
2919,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Where'er she turn'd her skinny finger, flew;"
2920,THE ENCHANTRESS.,The floods in ruin roll'd at her commands;
2921,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And when, in time of drought, the husbandman"
2922,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Beheld the gathered rain about to fall,"
2923,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Her breath would drive it to the desert sands.
2924,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"While in the marshes parch'd and gaping soil,"
2925,THE ENCHANTRESS.,The rice-roots by the searching Sun were dried;
2926,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And in lean groupes, assembled at the side"
2927,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Of the empty tank, the cattle dropt and died;"
2928,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"And Famine, at her bidding, wasted wide"
2929,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"The wretched land; till, in the public way,"
2930,THE ENCHANTRESS.,"Promiscuous where the dead and dying lay,"
2931,THE ENCHANTRESS.,Dogs fed on human bones in the open light of day.

3332,NOTES.,"which being done, the bridegroom takes three handfuls of rice, and"

3336,NOTES.,"out the water. This being done, the father puts his daughter's hand in"
3337,NOTES.,"his own, puts water into it, some pieces of money, {135} and, giving"
3338,NOTES.,"it to the bridegroom, says, at the same time, I have no longer any"
3339,NOTES.,"thing to do with you, and I give you up to the power of another. The"
3340,NOTES.,"_Tali_, which is a ribbon with a golden head hanging at it, is held"
3341,NOTES.,"ready; and, being shewn to the company, some prayers and blessings are"
3342,NOTES.,"pronounced; after which the bridegroom takes it, and hangs it about"
3343,NOTES.,the bride's neck. This knot is what particularly secures his
3344,NOTES.,"possession of her; for, before he had had the _Tali_ on, all the rest"
3345,NOTES.,of the ceremonies might have been made to no purpose; for it has
3346,NOTES.,"sometimes happened, that, when the bridegroom was going to fix it on,"
3347,NOTES.,the bride's father has discovered his not being satisfied with the
3348,NOTES.,"bridegroom's gift, when another, offering more, has carried off the"
3349,NOTES.,"bride with her father's consent. But when once the _Tali_ is put on,"
3350,NOTES.,"the marriage is indissoluble; and, whenever the husband dies, the"
3351,NOTES.,"_Tali_ is burnt along with him, to shew that the marriage bands are"
3352,NOTES.,"broke. Besides these particular ceremonies, the people have notice of"
3353,NOTES.,"the wedding by a _Pandal_, which is raised before the bride's door"
3354,NOTES.,some days before. The whole concludes with an entertainment which the
3355,NOTES.,"bride's father gives to the common friends; and during this festivity,"
3356,NOTES.,"which continues five days, alms are given to the poor, and the fire"
3357,NOTES.,"Homam is kept in. The seventh day, the new-married couple set out for"

3380,ROGER.,"executioners, the Bramins, together with an old hag that held her"
3381,ROGER.,"under the arm, thrust her on, and made her sit down upon the wood;"
3382,ROGER.,"and, lest she should run away, {137} they tied her legs and hands; and"

3386,ROGER.,"Pietro Della Valle conversed with a widow, who was about to burn"

3389,ROGER.,"of rank, when a young woman, who was handsome, was left a widow, and"
3390,ROGER.,"in danger of marrying again, (which is never practised among them,"
3391,ROGER.,because of the confusion and disgrace which are inseparable from such
3392,ROGER.,"a thing,) or of falling into other irregularities, then, indeed, the"
3393,ROGER.,"relations of the husband, if they are at all tenacious of the honour"
3394,ROGER.,"of the family, compel her to burn herself, whether she likes it or no,"
3395,ROGER.,merely to prevent the inconveniences which might take place.
3396,ROGER.,
3397,ROGER.,"Dellon also, whom I consider as one of the best travellers in the"

3407,ROGER.,
3408,ROGER.,It would be easy to multiply authorities upon this point. Let it
3409,ROGER.,suffice to mention one important historical fact: When the great
3410,ROGER.,"Alboquerque had established himself it Goa, he forbade these accursed"
3411,ROGER.,"sacrifices, the women extolled him for it as their benefactor and"
3412,ROGER.,"deliverer, (_Commentarios de Alb._ ii. 20,) and no European in India"
3413,ROGER.,"was ever so popular, or so revered by the natives. Yet, if we are to"
3414,ROGER.,"believe the anti-missionares, none but fools, fanatics, and pretenders"
3415,ROGER.,"to humanity, would wish to deprive the Hindoo women of the right of"
3416,ROGER.,"burning themselves! ""It may be useful (says Colonel Mark Wilks,) to"
3417,ROGER.,examine the reasonableness of interfering with the most exceptionable
3418,ROGER.,of all their institutions. It has been thought an abomination not to
3419,ROGER.,"be tolerated, that a widow should immolate herself on the funeral pile"
3420,ROGER.,of her deceased husband. But what judgement should we form of the
3421,ROGER.,"Hindoo, who (if any of our institutions admitted the parallel) should"
3422,ROGER.,_forcibly_ pretend to stand between a Christian and the hope of
3423,ROGER.,eternal salvation? And shall we not hold him to be a driveller in
3424,ROGER.,"politics and morals, a fanatic in religion, and a pretender in"
3425,ROGER.,"humanity, who would forcibly wrest this hope from the Hindoo {139}"
3426,ROGER.,"widow?""--_Historical Sketches of the South of India_, vol. i. p. 499."
3427,ROGER.,
3428,ROGER.,"Such opinions, and such language, may safely be left to the"
3429,ROGER.,indignation and pity which they cannot fail to excite. I shall only
3430,ROGER.,"express my astonishment, that any thing so monstrous, and so miserably"
3431,ROGER.,"futile, should have proceeded from a man of learning, great good"

3438,ROGER.,"When Bernier was passing from Amad-Avad to Agra, there came news to"
3439,ROGER.,"him in a borough, where the caravan rested under the shade, (staying"
3440,ROGER.,"for the cool of the evening to march on their journey,) that a woman"
3441,ROGER.,was then upon the point of burning herself with the body of her
3442,ROGER.,"husband. I presently rose, says he, and ran to the place where it was"
3443,ROGER.,"to be done, which was a great pit, with a pile of wood raised in it,"
3444,ROGER.,"whereon I saw laid a dead corpse, and a woman, which, at a distance,"
3445,ROGER.,"seemed to me pretty fair, sitting near it on the same pile, besides"
3446,ROGER.,"four or five Bramins, putting the fire to it from all sides; five"
3447,ROGER.,"women of a middle age, and well enough dressed, holding one another by"
3448,ROGER.,"the hand, and dancing about the pit, and a great crowd of people, men"
3449,ROGER.,"and women, looking {140} on. The pile of wood was presently all on"
3450,ROGER.,"fire, because store of oil and butter had been thrown upon it: and I"
3451,ROGER.,"saw, at the same time, through the flames, that the fire took hold of"
3452,ROGER.,"the clothes of the woman, that were imbued with well-scented oils,"
3453,ROGER.,"mingled with powder of sandal and saffron. All this I saw, but"
3454,ROGER.,"observed not that the woman was at all disturbed; yea, it was said,"
3455,ROGER.,"that she had been heard to pronounce, with great force, these two"
3456,ROGER.,"words, _five_, _two_, to signify, according to the opinion of those"
3457,ROGER.,"that hold the soul's transmigration, that this was the _fifth_ time"
3458,ROGER.,"she had burnt herself with the same husband, and that there remained"
3459,ROGER.,but two more for perfection; as if she had at that time this
3460,ROGER.,"remembrance, or some prophetical spirit. But here ended not this"
3461,ROGER.,infernal tragedy: I thought it was only by way of ceremony that these
3462,ROGER.,five women sung and danced about the pit; but I was altogether
3463,ROGER.,"surprised when I saw, that the flame having taken hold of the clothes"
3464,ROGER.,"of one of them, she cast herself, with her head foremost, into the"
3465,ROGER.,"pit; and that after her, another, being overcome by the flame and the"
3466,ROGER.,"smoke, did the like; and my astonishment redoubled afterwards, when I"
3467,ROGER.,"saw that the remaining three took one another again by the hand,"
3468,ROGER.,continued their dance without any apparent fear; and that at length
3469,ROGER.,"they precipitated themselves, one after another, into the fire, as"
3470,ROGER.,their {141} companions had done. I learnt that these had been five
3471,ROGER.,"slaves, who, having seen their mistress extremely afflicted at the"
3472,ROGER.,"sickness of her husband, and heard her promise him, that she would not"
3473,ROGER.,"survive him, but burn herself with him, were so touched with"
3474,ROGER.,"compassion and tenderness towards this their mistress, that they"
3475,ROGER.,"engaged themselves in a promise to follow her in her resolution, and"
3476,ROGER.,to burn themselves with her.--BERNIER.
3477,ROGER.,
3478,ROGER.,This excellent traveller relates an extraordinary circumstance which
3479,ROGER.,occurred at one of these sacrifices. A woman was engaged in some
3480,ROGER.,"love-intrigues with a young Mahommedan, her neighbour, who was a"
3481,ROGER.,"tailor, and could play finely upon the tabor. This woman, in the hopes"
3482,ROGER.,"she had of marrying this young man, poisoned her husband, and"
3483,ROGER.,"presently came away to tell the tailor, that it was time to be gone"
3484,ROGER.,"together, as they had projected, or else she should be obliged to burn"
3485,ROGER.,"herself. The young man, fearing lest he might be entangled in a"
3486,ROGER.,"mischievous business, flatly refused her. The woman, not at all"
3487,ROGER.,"surprised at it, went to her relations, and advertised them of the"
3488,ROGER.,"sudden death of her husband, and openly protested that she would not"
3489,ROGER.,"survive him, but burn herself with him. Her kindred, well satisfied"
3490,ROGER.,"with so generous a resolution, and the great honour she did to the"
3491,ROGER.,"whole family, presently had a pit made and filled with wood, exposing"
3492,ROGER.,"{142} the corpse upon it, and kindling the fire. All being prepared,"
3493,ROGER.,the woman goes to embrace and bid farewell to all her kindred that
3494,ROGER.,"were there about the pit, among whom was also the tailor, who had been"
3495,ROGER.,"invited to play upon the tabor that day, with many others of that sort"
3496,ROGER.,"of men, according to the custom of the country. This fury of a woman"
3497,ROGER.,"being also come to this young man, made sign as if she would bid him"
3498,ROGER.,"farewell with the rest; but, instead of gently embracing him, she"
3499,ROGER.,"taketh him with all her force about his collar, pulls him to the pit,"
3500,ROGER.,"and tumbleth him, together with herself, into the ditch, where they"
3501,ROGER.,both were soon dispatched.--BERNIER.
3502,ROGER.,
3503,ROGER.,The Hindoos sometimes erect a chapel on the spot where one of these
3504,ROGER.,"sacrifices has been performed, both on account of the soul of the"
3505,ROGER.,"deceased, and as a trophy of her virtue. I remember to have seen one"
3506,ROGER.,"of these places, where the spot on which the funeral pile had been"
3507,ROGER.,"erected was inclosed and covered with bamboos, formed into a kind of"
3508,ROGER.,bower planted with flowering creepers. The inside was set round with

3517,ROGER.,already been called on to produce the sanction of their Shasters for
3518,ROGER.,this custom. The passages exhibited are vague and general in their
3519,ROGER.,"meaning, and differently interpreted by the same casts. Some sacred"
3520,ROGER.,"verses commend the practice, but none command it; and the Pundits"
3521,ROGER.,"refer once more to _custom_. They have, however, intimated, that if"
3522,ROGER.,"government will pass a regulation, amercing by fine every Brahmin who"
3523,ROGER.,"attends a burning, or every Zemindar who permits him to attend it, the"
3524,ROGER.,"practice cannot possibly long continue; for that the ceremony,"

3533,ROGER.,"This practice, however, was manifestly unknown when the Institutes of"

3542,ROGER.,"having avoided sensuality from their early youth, and having left no"
3543,ROGER.,"issue in their families, have ascended nevertheless to heaven; and,"
3544,ROGER.,"like those abstemious men, a virtuous wife ascends to heaven, though"
3545,ROGER.,"she have no child, if, after the decease of her lord, she devote"
3546,ROGER.,"herself to pious austerity: but a widow, who, from a wish to bear"
3547,ROGER.,"children, slights her deceased husband by marrying again, brings"

3559,ROGER.,"reception. This appears to correspond with an opinion of Plato, which,"

3658,ROGER.,"divideth it not, the fire burneth it not, the water corrupteth it not,"
3659,ROGER.,"the wind drieth it not away;--for it is indivisible, inconsumable,"

3666,ROGER.,
3667,ROGER.,"Mariatale, as Sonnerat spells the name, was wife of the penitent"
3668,ROGER.,"Chamadaguini, and mother of Parassourama, who was, in part, an"
3669,ROGER.,"incarnation of Veeshno. This goddess, says Sonnerat, commanded the"
3670,ROGER.,"elements, but could not preserve that empire longer than her heart was"
3671,ROGER.,"pure. One day, while she was collecting water out of a tank, and,"
3672,ROGER.,"according to her custom, was making a bowl of earth to carry it to the"
3673,ROGER.,"house, she saw on the surface of the water, some figures of Grindovers"
3674,ROGER.,(Glendoveers) which were flying over her head. Struck with their
3675,ROGER.,"beauty, her heart admitted an impure thought, and the earth of the"
3676,ROGER.,bowl dissolved. From that time she was obliged to make use of an
3677,ROGER.,ordinary vessel. This discovered to Chamadaguini that his wife had
3678,ROGER.,"deviated from purity; and, in the excess of his rage, he ordered his"
3679,ROGER.,"son to drag her to the place where criminals were executed, and to"
3680,ROGER.,behead her. The order was executed; but Parassourama was so much
3681,ROGER.,"afflicted for the loss of his mother, that Chamadaguini told him to"
3682,ROGER.,"take up the body, and fasten the head upon it, and repeat a prayer"
3683,ROGER.,"(which he taught him for that purpose) in her ear, and then his mother"
3684,ROGER.,{150} would come to life again. The son ran eagerly to perform what he
3685,ROGER.,"was ordered, but, by a very singular blunder, he joined the head of"
3686,ROGER.,"his mother to the body of a Parichi, who had been executed for her"
3687,ROGER.,"crimes; a monstrous union, which gave to this woman the virtues of a"
3688,ROGER.,"goddess, and the vices of a criminal. The goddess, becoming impure by"
3689,ROGER.,"such a mixture, was driven from her house, and committed all kinds of"
3690,ROGER.,"cruelties. The Deverkels, perceiving the destruction she made,"
3691,ROGER.,"appeased her by giving her power to cure the small-pox, and promising"
3692,ROGER.,that she should be implored for that disorder. Mariatale is the great
3693,ROGER.,"goddess of the Parias;--to honour her, they have a custom of dancing"
3694,ROGER.,"with several pots of water on their heads, placed one above the other:"
3695,ROGER.,"These pots are adorned with the leaves of the Margosies, a tree"
3696,ROGER.,consecrated to her.

3700,ROGER.,
3701,ROGER.,Among the qualities required for the proper execution of public
3702,ROGER.,"business, mention is made, ""That a man must be able to keep in"
3703,ROGER.,"subjection his lust, his anger, his avarice, his _folly_, and his"
3704,ROGER.,"pride."" The folly there specified is not to be understood in the usual"
3705,ROGER.,"sense of the word in an European idiom, as a negative quality, or the"
3706,ROGER.,"mere want of sense, but as a kind of obstinately stupid {151}"
3707,ROGER.,"lethargy, or perverse absence of mind, in which the will is not"
3708,ROGER.,"altogether passive: It seems to be a weakness peculiar to Asia, for we"
3709,ROGER.,cannot find a term by which to express the precise idea in the
3710,ROGER.,European languages. It operates somewhat like the violent impulse of
3711,ROGER.,"fear, under which men will utter falsehoods totally incompatible with"
3712,ROGER.,"each other, and utterly contrary to their own opinion, knowledge, and"
3713,ROGER.,"conviction; and, it may be added also, their inclination and"
3714,ROGER.,intention.
3715,ROGER.,
3716,ROGER.,A very remarkable instance of this temporary frenzy happened lately in
3717,ROGER.,"the supreme Court of Judicature at Calcutta, where a man (not an"
3718,ROGER.,"idiot) swore, upon a trial, that he was no kind of relation to his"
3719,ROGER.,"brother, who was then in Court, and who had constantly supported him"
3720,ROGER.,"from his infancy; and that he lived in a house by himself, for which"
3721,ROGER.,"he paid the rent from his own pocket, when it was proved that he was"
3722,ROGER.,"not worth a rupee, and when the person in whose house he had always"
3723,ROGER.,resided stood at the bar close to him.
3724,ROGER.,
3725,ROGER.,"Another conjecture, and that exceedingly acute and ingenious, has been"
3726,ROGER.,"started upon this _folly_, that it may mean the deception which a man"
3727,ROGER.,"permits to be imposed on his judgment by his passions, as acts of"
3728,ROGER.,rapacity and avarice are often committed by men who ascribe them to
3729,ROGER.,prudence and a just assertion of their own right; malice {152} and
3730,ROGER.,"rancour pass for justice, and brutality for spirit. This opinion, when"
3731,ROGER.,"thoroughly examined, will very nearly tally with the former; for all"
3732,ROGER.,"the passions, as well as fear, have an equal efficacy to disturb and"
3733,ROGER.,distort the mind: But to account for the _folly_ here spoken of as
3734,ROGER.,"being the offspring of the passions, instead of drawing a parallel"
3735,ROGER.,"between it and the impulses of those passions, we must suppose the"
3736,ROGER.,impulses to act with infinitely more violence upon an Asiatic mind
3737,ROGER.,"than we can ever have seen exemplified in Europe. It is, however,"
3738,ROGER.,something like the madness so inimitably delineated in the Hero of
3739,ROGER.,"Cervantes, sensible enough upon some occasions, and at the same time"
3740,ROGER.,"completely wild, and unconscious of itself upon others; and that, too,"
3741,ROGER.,"originally produced by an effort of the will, though, in the end,"
3742,ROGER.,overpowering and superseding its functions.--HALHED.

3752,ROGER.,"their breasts agitated, breathing with difficulty, and as if they"
3753,ROGER.,panted {153} for respiration. The instinct which induces them to
3754,ROGER.,"prefer those means of subsistence which are easily obtained, and in"

3825,ROGER.,The first and greatest of the sons of Sevee is Pollear: he presides
3826,ROGER.,over marriages: The Indians build no house without having first
3827,ROGER.,"carried a Pollear on the ground, which they sprinkle with oil, and"
3828,ROGER.,throw flowers on it {156} every day. If they do not invoke it before
3829,ROGER.,"they undertake any enterprise, they believe that God will make them"
3830,ROGER.,"forget what they wanted to undertake, and that their labour will be in"
3831,ROGER.,"vain. He is represented with an elephant's head, and mounted on a rat;"
3832,ROGER.,"but in the pagodas they place him on a pedestal, with his legs almost"
3833,ROGER.,crossed. A rat is always put before the door of his chapel. This rat
3834,ROGER.,"was a giant, called Gudja-mouga-chourin, on whom the gods had bestowed"
3835,ROGER.,"immortality, as well as great powers, which he abused, and did much"
3836,ROGER.,"harm to mankind. Pollear, entreated by the sages and penitents to"
3837,ROGER.,"deliver them, pulled out one of his tusks, and threw it against"
3838,ROGER.,"Gudja-mouga-chourin; the tooth entered the giant's stomach, and"
3839,ROGER.,"overthrew him, who immediately changed himself into a rat as large as"
3840,ROGER.,"a mountain, and came to attack Pollear, who sprung on his back,"
3841,ROGER.,"telling him, that hereafter he should ever be his carrier."
3842,ROGER.,
3843,ROGER.,"The Indians, in their adoration of this god, cross their arms, shut"

3846,ROGER.,"their ears, and make three inclinations, bending the knee; after"
3847,ROGER.,"which, with their hands joined, they address their prayers to him, and"
3848,ROGER.,"strike their forehead. They have a great veneration for this deity,"
3849,ROGER.,"whose image they place in all temples, streets, {157} highways, and,"
3850,ROGER.,"in the country, at the foot of some tree, that all the world may have"

3858,ROGER.,"This word is altered from the _Grindouvers_ of Sonnerat, who describes"

3860,ROGER.,"have wings, he adds, and fly in the air with their wives. I do not"

3862,ROGER.,The wings with which they are attired in the poem are borrowed from

3870,ROGER.,"I called it before, (and indeed for several of its properties, as"
3871,ROGER.,"toughness, elasticity, and pliableness, nothing I have ever seen can"
3872,ROGER.,"so justly be compared to it,) which were jointed behind to the"
3873,ROGER.,"upper-bone of the spine, and which, when not extended, lie bent over"
3874,ROGER.,"the shoulders {158} on each side of the neck forwards, from whence, by"
3875,ROGER.,"nearer and nearer approaches, they just meet at the lower rim of the"
3876,ROGER.,"belly in a sort of point; but, when extended, they stand their whole"
3877,ROGER.,"length above the shoulders, not perpendicularly, but spreading"
3878,ROGER.,"outwards, with a web of the softest and most pliable and spungy"
3879,ROGER.,"membrane that can be imagined in the interstices between them,"
3880,ROGER.,reaching from their root or joint on the back up above the hinder part
3881,ROGER.,"of the head, and near half way their own length; but, when closed, the"
3882,ROGER.,"membrane falls down in the middle upon the neck, like an handkerchief."
3883,ROGER.,"There are also two other ribs, rising, as it were, from the same root,"
3884,ROGER.,"which, when open, run horizontally, but not so long as the others."
3885,ROGER.,These are filled up in the interstice between them and the upper ones
3886,ROGER.,with the same membrane; and on the lower side of this is also a deep
3887,ROGER.,"flap of the membrane, so that the arms can be either above or below it"
3888,ROGER.,"in flight, and are always above it when closed. This last rib, when"
3889,ROGER.,"shut, flaps under the upper one, and also falls down with it before to"
3890,ROGER.,the waist; but it is not joined to the ribs below. Along the whole
3891,ROGER.,"spine-bone runs a strong, flat, broad, grisly cartilage, to which are"
3892,ROGER.,"joined several other of these ribs, all which open horizontally, and"
3893,ROGER.,"are filled in the interstices with the above membrane, and are jointed"
3894,ROGER.,to the ribs of the person just where {159} the plane of the back
3895,ROGER.,"begins to turn towards the breast and belly; and, when shut, wrap the"
3896,ROGER.,"body round to the joints on the contrary side, folding neatly one side"
3897,ROGER.,over the other.
3898,ROGER.,
3899,ROGER.,"""At the lower spine are two more ribs extended horizontally when open,"
3900,ROGER.,"jointed again to the hips, and long enough to meet the joint on the"
3901,ROGER.,"contrary side cross the belly: and from the hip-joint, which is on the"
3902,ROGER.,"outermost edge of the hip-bone, runs a pliable cartilage quite down"
3903,ROGER.,the outside of the thigh and leg to the ancle; from which there branch
3904,ROGER.,"out divers other ribs, horizontally also when open, but, when closed,"
3905,ROGER.,"they encompass the whole thigh and leg, rolling inwards cross the back"
3906,ROGER.,"of the leg and thigh, till they reach and just cover the cartilage."
3907,ROGER.,The interstices of these are filled up with the same membrane. From
3908,ROGER.,"the two ribs which join to the lower spine-bone, there hangs down a"
3909,ROGER.,"sort of short apron, very full of plaits, from hip-joint to hip-joint,"
3910,ROGER.,"and reaches below the buttocks, half way or more to the hams. This has"
3911,ROGER.,"also several small limber ribs in it. Just upon the lower spine-joint,"
3912,ROGER.,"and above the apron, as I call it, there are two other long branches,"
3913,ROGER.,"which, when close, extend upon the back from the point they join at"
3914,ROGER.,"below to the shoulders, where each rib has a clasper, which, reaching"
3915,ROGER.,"over the shoulders, just under the fold of the uppermost branch {160}"
3916,ROGER.,"or ribs, hold up the two ribs flat to the back, like a V, the"
3917,ROGER.,interstices of which are filled up with the aforesaid membrane. This
3918,ROGER.,"last piece, in flight, falls down almost to the ancles, where the two"
3919,ROGER.,"claspers, lapping under each leg within-side, hold it very fast; and"
3920,ROGER.,"then, also, the short apron is drawn up, by the strength of the ribs"
3921,ROGER.,"in it, between the thighs forward, and covers as far as the rim of the"
3922,ROGER.,belly. The whole arms are covered also from the shoulders to the wrist
3923,ROGER.,"with the same delicate membrane, fastened to ribs of proportionable"
3924,ROGER.,"dimensions, and jointed to a cartilage on the outside in the same"
3925,ROGER.,manner as on the legs. It is very surprising to feel the difference of
3926,ROGER.,"these ribs when open and when closed; for closed, they are as pliable"
3927,ROGER.,"as the finest whale-bone, or more so; but, when extended, are as"
3928,ROGER.,"strong and stiff as a bone. They are tapering from the roots, and are"
3929,ROGER.,"broader or narrower, as best suits the places they occupy, and the"
3930,ROGER.,"stress they are put to, up to their points, which are almost as small"
3931,ROGER.,as a hair. The membrane between them is the most elastic thing I ever
3932,ROGER.,"met with, occupying no more space, when the ribs are closed, than just"
3933,ROGER.,"from rib to rib, as flat and smooth as possible; but, when extended in"
3934,ROGER.,"some postures, will dilate itself surprisingly,"
3935,ROGER.,
3936,ROGER.,"""It is the most amazing thing in the world to observe the large"
3937,ROGER.,"expansion of this graundee when open, and, {161} when closed, (as it"
3938,ROGER.,"all is in a moment, upon the party's descent,) to see it fit so close"
3939,ROGER.,and compact to the body as no tailor can come up to it; and then the
3940,ROGER.,"several ribs lie so justly disposed in the several parts, that instead"
3941,ROGER.,"of being, as one would imagine, a disadvantage to the shape, they make"
3942,ROGER.,the body and limbs look extremely elegant; and by the different
3943,ROGER.,"adjustment of their lines on the body and limbs, the whole, to my"
3944,ROGER.,"fancy, somewhat resembles the dress of the old Roman warriors in their"
3945,ROGER.,"buskins; and, to appearance, seems much more noble than any fictitious"
3946,ROGER.,"garb I ever saw, or can frame a notion of to myself."""

4113,ROGER.,"in the palace,--a sort of speaking almanack: _Mahadeva_, (i. e."
4114,ROGER.,"Seeva,) in his Avatara of _Kandeh-roo_, performed the office of"
4115,ROGER.,"barber, and trimmed the giants' beards: _Vishnu_ had the honourable"

4121,ROGER.,industry and attention. Nor were the female divinities exempted; for
4122,ROGER.,"_Bhavani_, in her name and form of _Satni_, {168} was head Aya, or"

4127,ROGER.,"Seeva was once in danger even of annihilation: ""In passing from the"
4128,ROGER.,"town of Silgut to Deonhully, says Colonel Wilks, I became accidentally"
4129,ROGER.,"informed of a sect, peculiar, as I since understand, to the"
4130,ROGER.,"north-eastern parts of Mysoor, the women of which universally undergo"
4131,ROGER.,the amputation of the first joints of the third and fourth fingers of
4132,ROGER.,"their right hands. On my arrival at Deonhully, after ascertaining that"
4133,ROGER.,"the request would not give offence, I desired to see some of these"
4134,ROGER.,"women; and, the same afternoon, seven of them attended at my tent. The"
4135,ROGER.,"sect is a sub-division of the _Murresoo Wokul_,[1] and belongs to"
4136,ROGER.,"the fourth great class of the Hindoos, viz. the Souder. Every woman of"
4137,ROGER.,"the sect, previously to piercing the ears of her eldest daughter,"
4138,ROGER.,"preparatory to her being betrothed in marriage, must necessarily"
4139,ROGER.,"undergo this mutilation, which is performed by the blacksmith of the"
4140,ROGER.,"village, for a regulated fee, by a surgical process sufficiently rude."
4141,ROGER.,The finger to be amputated is placed on a block; the blacksmith places
4142,ROGER.,"a chisel over the articulation of the {169} joint, and chops it off at"
4143,ROGER.,"a single blow. If the girl to be betrothed is motherless, and the"
4144,ROGER.,"mother of the boy have not before been subject to the operation, it is"
4145,ROGER.,incumbent on her to perform the sacrifice. After satisfying myself
4146,ROGER.,"with regard to the facts of the case, I enquired into the origin of so"
4147,ROGER.,"strange a practice, and one of the women related, with great fluency,"
4148,ROGER.,"the following traditionary tale, which has since been repeated to me,"
4149,ROGER.,"with no material deviation, by several others of the sect:"
4150,ROGER.,
4151,ROGER.,"A Rachas (or giant) named _Vrica_, and in after times _Busm-aasoor_,"
4152,ROGER.,"or the giant of the ashes, had, by a course of austere devotion to"
4153,ROGER.,_Mahadeo_ (Seeva) obtained from him the promise of whatever boon he
4154,ROGER.,"should ask. The Rachas accordingly demanded, that every person on"
4155,ROGER.,"whose head he should place his right hand, might instantly be reduced"
4156,ROGER.,"to ashes; and Mahadeo conferred the boon, without suspicion of the"
4157,ROGER.,purpose for which it was designed.
4158,ROGER.,
4159,ROGER.,"The Rachas no sooner found himself possessed of this formidable power,"
4160,ROGER.,than he attempted to use it for the destruction of his benefactor.
4161,ROGER.,"Mahadeo fled, the Rachas pursued, and followed the fugitive so closely"
4162,ROGER.,"as to chace him into a duck grove; where Mahadeo, changing his form"
4163,ROGER.,"and bulk, concealed himself in the centre of a fruit, then called"
4164,ROGER.,"_tunda pundoo_, but since named _linga_ {170} _tunda_, from the"
4165,ROGER.,"resemblance which its kernel thenceforward assumed to the _ling_, the"
4166,ROGER.,appropriate emblem of Mahadeo.
4167,ROGER.,
4168,ROGER.,"The Rachas having lost sight of Mahadeo, enquired of a husbandman, who"
4169,ROGER.,"was working in the adjoining field, whether he had seen the fugitive,"
4170,ROGER.,"and what direction he had taken. The husbandman, who had attentively"
4171,ROGER.,"observed the whole transaction, fearful of the future resentment of"
4172,ROGER.,"Mahadeo, and equally alarmed for the present vengeance of the giant,"
4173,ROGER.,"answered aloud, that he had seen no fugitive, but pointed, at the same"
4174,ROGER.,"time, with the little finger of his right hand, to the place of"
4175,ROGER.,Mahadeo's concealment.
4176,ROGER.,
4177,ROGER.,"In this extremity,[2] Vishnou descended, in the form of a"
4178,ROGER.,"beautiful damsel, to the rescue of Mahadeo. The Rachas became"
4179,ROGER.,"instantly enamoured;--the damsel was a _pure_ Brahmin, and might not"
4180,ROGER.,be approached by the _unclean_ Rachas. By degrees she appeared to
4181,ROGER.,"relent; and, as a previous condition to farther advances, enjoined the"
4182,ROGER.,performance of his ablutions in a neighbouring pool. After these were
4183,ROGER.,"finished, she prescribed, as a farther purification, the performance"
4184,ROGER.,"of the _Sundia_,--a ceremony in which the right hand is successively"
4185,ROGER.,"applied to the breast, to the crown of the head, and to other parts of"
4186,ROGER.,"the body. {171} The Rachas, thinking only of love, and forgetful of"
4187,ROGER.,"the powers of his right hand, performed the _Sundia_, and was himself"
4188,ROGER.,reduced to ashes.
4189,ROGER.,
4190,ROGER.,"Mahadeo now issued from the _linga tunda_, and, after the proper"
4191,ROGER.,"acknowledgments for his deliverance, proceeded to discuss the guilt of"
4192,ROGER.,"the treacherous husbandman, and determined on the loss of the finger"
4193,ROGER.,"with which he had offended, as the proper punishment of his crime."
4194,ROGER.,
4195,ROGER.,"The wife of the husbandman, who had just arrived at the field with"
4196,ROGER.,"food for her husband, hearing this dreadful sentence, threw herself at"
4197,ROGER.,"the feet of Mahadeo. She represented the certain ruin of her family,"
4198,ROGER.,if her husband should be disabled for some months from performing the
4199,ROGER.,"labours of the farm, and besought the Deity to accept two of her"
4200,ROGER.,"fingers, instead of one from her husband. Mahadeo, pleased with so"
4201,ROGER.,"sincere a proof of conjugal affection, accepted the exchange, and"
4202,ROGER.,"ordained, that her female posterity, in all future generations, should"
4203,ROGER.,"sacrifice two fingers at his temple, as a memorial of the transaction,"
4204,ROGER.,and of their exclusive devotion to the God of the Ling.
4205,ROGER.,
4206,ROGER.,"The practice is, accordingly, confined to the supposed, posterity of"
4207,ROGER.,"this single woman, and is not common to the whole sect of"
4208,ROGER.,Murresoo-Wokul. I ascertained the actual number of families who
4209,ROGER.,observed this practice in three {172} successive districts through
4210,ROGER.,"which I afterwards passed, and I conjecture that, within the limits of"
4211,ROGER.,"Misoor, they may amount to about two thousand houses."
4212,ROGER.,
4213,ROGER.,"The Hill of _Sectee_, in the talook of Colar, where the giant was"
4214,ROGER.,"destroyed, is (according to this tradition) formed of the ashes of"
4215,ROGER.,"Busmaa-soor: It is held in particular veneration by this sect, as the"
4216,ROGER.,chief seat of their appropriate sacrifice; and the fact of its
4217,ROGER.,"containing little or no moisture, is held to be a miraculous proof"
4218,ROGER.,that the ashes of the giant continue to absorb the most violent and
4219,ROGER.,continued rain. This is a remarkable example of easy credulity. I have

4230,ROGER.,
4231,ROGER.,"""A most pious and venerable sage, named RISHI'CE'SA, being very far"
4232,ROGER.,"advanced in years, had resolved to visit, before he died, all the"
4233,ROGER.,"famed places of pilgrimage; and, having performed his resolution, he"
4234,ROGER.,"bathed at last in the sacred water of the _Ca'li_, where he observed"
4235,ROGER.,"some {173} fishes engaged in amorous play, and restating on their"
4236,ROGER.,"numerous progeny, which would sport like then in the stream, he"
4237,ROGER.,"lamented the improbability of leaving any children: but, since he"
4238,ROGER.,"might possibly be a father, even at his great age, he went immediately"
4239,ROGER.,"to the king of that country, HIRANYAVERNA, who had fifty daughters,"
4240,ROGER.,and demanded one of them in marriage. So strange a demand gave the
4241,ROGER.,prince great uneasiness: yet he was unwilling to incur the displeasure
4242,ROGER.,"of a saint, whose imprecations he dreaded; he, therefore, invoked"
4243,ROGER.,"_Heri_, or _Vishnu_; to inspire him with a wise answer, and told the"
4244,ROGER.,"hoar philosopher, that he should marry any one of his daughters, who,"
4245,ROGER.,"of her own accord, should fix on him as her bridegroom. The sage,"
4246,ROGER.,"rather disconcerted, left the palace; but, calling to mind the two"
4247,ROGER.,"sons of ASWINI, he hastened to their terrestrial abode, and"
4248,ROGER.,requested that they would bestow on him both youth and beauty: they
4249,ROGER.,"immediately conducted him to _Abhimatada_, which we suppose to be"
4250,ROGER.,"_Abydus_, in Upper _Egypt_; and, when he had bathed in the pool of"
4251,ROGER.,"_Rupayauvana_, he was restored to the flower of his age with the"
4252,ROGER.,"graces and charms of CA'MA'DE'VA. On his return to the palace, he"
4253,ROGER.,"entered the secret apartments, called _antahpura_, where the fifty"
4254,ROGER.,princesses were assembled: and they were all so transported with the
4255,ROGER.,"vision of more than human beauty, {174} that they fell into an"
4256,ROGER.,"ecstacy, whence the place was afterwards named _Mohast-han_, or"
4257,ROGER.,"_Mohana_, and is, possibly, the same with _Mohannan_. They no sooner"
4258,ROGER.,"had recovered from their trance, than each of them exclaimed, that she"
4259,ROGER.,would be his bride; and their altercation having brought
4260,ROGER.,"HIRANYAVERNA into their apartment, he terminated the contest by"
4261,ROGER.,"giving them all in marriage to RISHICE'SA, who became the father of"
4262,ROGER.,"a hundred sons; and, when he succeeded to the throne, built the city"
4263,ROGER.,"of _Suc-haverddhana_, framed _vimânas_, or celestial, self-moving"
4264,ROGER.,"cars, in which he visited the gods, and made gardens, abounding in"

4266,ROGER.,"the desire, which he formed at _Matoyasangama_, or the place where the"

4331,ROGER.,"it, are never empty, but contain enough to supply both men and"
4332,ROGER.,beasts.--MANDELSLO.

4334,ROGER.,"Feyjoo denies the existence of any such tree, upon the authority of P."
4335,ROGER.,"Tallandier, a French Jesuit, (quoted in Men. de Trevoux. 2715, art."
4336,ROGER.,"97.) who visited the island. ""_Assi no dudo_,"" he adds, ""_que este"
4337,ROGER.,"Fenix de las plantas es ten fingedo como el de las aves._""--Theat."
4338,ROGER.,Crit. _Tom. ii. Disc_. 2. § 65. What authority is due to the
4339,ROGER.,"testimony of this French Jesuit I do not know, never having seen his"
4340,ROGER.,"book; but it appears, from the undoubted evidence of Glas, that its"
4341,ROGER.,"existence is believed in the Canaries, and positively affirmed by the"
4342,ROGER.,inhabitants of Fierro itself.
4343,ROGER.,
4344,ROGER.,"""There are,"" says this excellent author, ""only three fountains of"
4345,ROGER.,"water in the whole island, one of them is called Acof,[3] which,"
4346,ROGER.,"in the language of the ancient inhabitants, signifies river; a name,"
4347,ROGER.,"however, which does not seem to have been given it on account of its"
4348,ROGER.,"yielding much water, for in that respect it hardly deserves the same"
4349,ROGER.,of a fountain. More to the northward is another called Hapio; and in
4350,ROGER.,"the middle of the island is a spring, {178} yielding a stream about"
4351,ROGER.,the thickness of a man's finger. This last was discovered in the year
4352,ROGER.,"1565, and is called the Fountain of Anton Hernandez. On account of the"
4353,ROGER.,"scarcity of water, the sheep, goats, and swine here do not drink in"
4354,ROGER.,"the summer, but are taught to dig up the roots of fern, and chew them,"
4355,ROGER.,to quench their thirst. The great cattle are watered at those
4356,ROGER.,"fountains, and at a place where water distils from the leaves of a"
4357,ROGER.,tree. Many writers have made mention of this famous tree; some in such
4358,ROGER.,a manner as to make it appear miraculous; others again deny the
4359,ROGER.,"existence of any such tree, among whom is Father Feyjoo, a modern"
4360,ROGER.,"Spanish author, in his _Theatro Critico_. But he, and those who agree"
4361,ROGER.,"with him in this matter, are as much mistaken as they who would make"
4362,ROGER.,it appear miraculous. This is the only island of all the Canaries
4363,ROGER.,"which I have not been in; but I have sailed with natives of Hierro,"
4364,ROGER.,"who, when questioned about the existence of this tree, answered in the"
4365,ROGER.,affirmative.
4366,ROGER.,
4367,ROGER.,The author of the History of the Discovery and Conquest has given us a
4368,ROGER.,"particular account of it, which I shall relate here at large. ""The"
4369,ROGER.,"district in which this tree stands is called Tigulahe; near to which,"
4370,ROGER.,"and in the cliff, or steep rocky ascent that surrounds the whole"
4371,ROGER.,"island, is a narrow gutter or gulley, which commences at the sea, and"
4372,ROGER.,"continues to the summit of the cliff, where it joins or {179}"
4373,ROGER.,"coincides with a valley, which is terminated by the steep front of a"
4374,ROGER.,"rock. On the top of this rock grows a tree, called, in the language of"
4375,ROGER.,"the ancient inhabitants, Garse, _i.e._ Sacred or Holy Tree, which,"
4376,ROGER.,"for many years, has been preserved sound, entire, and fresh. Its"
4377,ROGER.,leaves constantly distil such a quantity of water as is sufficient to
4378,ROGER.,furnish drink to every living creature in Hierro; nature having
4379,ROGER.,provided this remedy for the drought of the island. It is situated
4380,ROGER.,about a league and a half from the sea. Nobody knows of what species
4381,ROGER.,"it is, only that it is called Til. It is distinct from other, trees,"
4382,ROGER.,and stands by itself; the circumference of the trunk is about twelve
4383,ROGER.,"spans, the diameter four, and in height, from the ground to the top of"
4384,ROGER.,"the highest branch, forty spans: The circumference of all the branches"
4385,ROGER.,"together, is one hundred and twenty feet. The branches are thick and"
4386,ROGER.,extended; the lowest commence about the height of an ell from the
4387,ROGER.,"ground. Its fruit resembles the acorn, and tastes something like the"
4388,ROGER.,"kernel of a pine-nut, but is softer and more aromatic. The leaves of"
4389,ROGER.,"this tree resemble those of the laurel, but are larger, wider, and"
4390,ROGER.,"more curved; they come forth in a perpetual succession, so that the"
4391,ROGER.,"tree always remains green. Near to it grows a thorn, which fastens on"
4392,ROGER.,"many of its branches, and interweaves with them; and, at a small"
4393,ROGER.,"distance from the Garse, are some beech-trees, {180} bresos, and"
4394,ROGER.,"thorns. On the north side of the trunk are two large tanks, or"
4395,ROGER.,"cisterns, of rough stone, or rather one patera divided, each half"
4396,ROGER.,"being twenty feet square, and sixteen spans in depth. One of these"
4397,ROGER.,"contains water for the drinking of the inhabitants, and the other that"
4398,ROGER.,"which they use for their cattle, washing, and such like purposes."
4399,ROGER.,"Every morning, near this part of the island, a cloud or mist arises"
4400,ROGER.,"from the sea, which the south and easterly winds force against the"
4401,ROGER.,"fore-mentioned steep cliff; so that the cloud, having no vent but by"
4402,ROGER.,"the gutter, gradually ascends it, and from thence advances slowly to"
4403,ROGER.,"the extremity of the valley, where it is stopped and checked by the"
4404,ROGER.,"front of the rock which terminates the valley, and then rests upon the"
4405,ROGER.,thick leaves and wide-spreading branches of the tree; from whence it
4406,ROGER.,"distils in drops during the remainder of the day, until it is at"
4407,ROGER.,"length exhausted, in the same manner that we see water drip from the"
4408,ROGER.,leaves of trees after a heavy shower of rain. This distillation is not
4409,ROGER.,"peculiar to the Garse, or Til, for the bresos which grow near it"
4410,ROGER.,"likewise drop water; but their leaves being but few and narrow, the"
4411,ROGER.,"quantity is so trifling, that, though the natives save some of it, yet"
4412,ROGER.,they make little or no account of any but what distils from the Til;
4413,ROGER.,"which, together with the water of some fountains, and what is saved in"
4414,ROGER.,"the winter season, is sufficient to {181} serve them and their flocks."
4415,ROGER.,"This tree yields most water in those years when the Levant, or"
4416,ROGER.,"easterly winds, have prevailed for a continuance; for by these winds"
4417,ROGER.,"only, the clouds or mists are drawn hither from the sea. A person"
4418,ROGER.,"lives on the spot near which this tree grows, who is appointed by the"
4419,ROGER.,"Council to take care of it and its water, and is allowed a house to"
4420,ROGER.,"live in, with a certain salary. He every day distributes to each"
4421,ROGER.,"family of the district, seven pots or vessels full of water, besides"
4422,ROGER.,"what he gives to the principal people of the island."""
4423,ROGER.,
4424,ROGER.,"""Whether the tree which yields water at this present time be the same"
4425,ROGER.,"as that mentioned in the above description, I cannot pretend to"
4426,ROGER.,"determine, but it is probable there has been a succession of them; for"
4427,ROGER.,"Pliny, describing the Fortunate Islands, says, ""In the mountains of"
4428,ROGER.,"Ombrion, are trees resembling the plant Ferula, from which water may"
4429,ROGER.,"be procured by pressure: What comes from the black kind is bitter,"
4430,ROGER.,"but that which the white yields is sweet and palatable.""--GLAS's"
4431,ROGER.,_History of the Canary Islands_.
4432,ROGER.,
4433,ROGER.,"Cordeyro (_Historia Insulana_, lib. ii. c. 5.) says, that this tree"
4434,ROGER.,"resembles what in other places is called the _Til_, (_Tilia_,) the"
4435,ROGER.,"Linden Tree; and he proceeds, from these three letters, to make it an"
4436,ROGER.,"emblem of the Trinity. The water, he says, was called the _Agua"
4437,ROGER.,"Santa_, and the tree {182} itself the _Santa Arvore_,--appellations"
4438,ROGER.,not ill bestowed. According to his account the water was delivered out
4439,ROGER.,in stated portions.
4440,ROGER.,
4441,ROGER.,There is an account of a similar tree in Cockburne's Travels; but this
4442,ROGER.,"I believe to be a work of fiction. Bernal Diaz, however, mentions one"
4443,ROGER.,"as growing at Naco, in Honduras, ""_Que en mitad de la siesta, por"
4444,ROGER.,"recio sol que hiziesse, parecia que la sombra del arbol refrescava el"
4445,ROGER.,"corazon, caia del uno como rozio muy delgado que confortava las"
4446,ROGER.,"cabezas._""--206."
4447,ROGER.,
4448,ROGER.,"There may be some exaggeration in the accounts of the Fierro Tree, but"
4449,ROGER.,that the story has some foundation I have no doubt. The islanders of
4450,ROGER.,"St. Thomas say, that they have a sort of trees whose leaves"
4451,ROGER.,"continually are distilling water. (_Barbot. in Churckle_, 405.) It is"
4452,ROGER.,"certain that a dew falls in hot weather from the lime,--a fact of"
4453,ROGER.,which any person may easily convince himself. The same property has
4454,ROGER.,"been observed in other English trees, as appears by the following"
4455,ROGER.,extract from the Monthly Magazine:
4456,ROGER.,
4457,ROGER.,"""In the beginning of August, after a sun-shine day, the air became"
4458,ROGER.,"suddenly misty about six o'clock; I walked, however, by the road side"
4459,ROGER.,"from seven to eight, and observed, in many places, that a shower of"
4460,ROGER.,"big drops of water was falling under the large trees, although no rain"
4461,ROGER.,"{183} fell elsewhere. The road and path continued dusty, and the"
4462,ROGER.,field-gates showed no signs of being wetted by the mist. I have often
4463,ROGER.,"noticed the like fact, but have not met with a satisfactory"
4464,ROGER.,"explanation of this power in trees to condense mist."""

4466,ROGER.,I am not the only poet who has availed himself of the Fierro Tree. It
4467,ROGER.,"is thus introduced in the Columbus of Carrara,--a singular work,"

4620,ROGER.,
4621,ROGER.,"A very distinguished son of Brahma, named Nared, bears a strong"
4622,ROGER.,"resemblance to Hermes or Mercury; he was a wise legislator, great in"
4623,ROGER.,"arts and in arms, an eloquent messenger of the Gods either to one"
4624,ROGER.,"another, or to favoured mortals, and a musician of exquisite skill."
4625,ROGER.,"His invention of the _Vina_, or Indian lute, is thus described in the"
4626,ROGER.,"poem entitled _Magha_: ""Nared sat watching from time to time his large"
4627,ROGER.,"_Vina_, which, by the impulse of the breeze, yielded notes that"
4628,ROGER.,"pierced successively the regions of his ear, and proceeded by musical"
4629,ROGER.,"intervals.""--_Asiatic Researches_, Sir W. JONES."
4630,ROGER.,
4631,ROGER.,The _Vina_ is an Æolian harp. The people of Amboyna have a different
4632,ROGER.,"kind of Æolian instrument, which is thus described in the first"
4633,ROGER.,"account of D'Entrecasteaux's Voyage: ""Being on the sea-shore, I heard"
4634,ROGER.,"some wind-instruments, the harmony of which, though sometimes very"
4635,ROGER.,"correct, was intermixed with discordant notes that were by no means"
4636,ROGER.,"unpleasing. These sounds, which were very musical, and formed fine"
4637,ROGER.,"cadences, seemed to come from such a distance, that I for some time"
4638,ROGER.,"imagined the natives were having a concert beyond the road-stead, near"
4639,ROGER.,a myriameter {190} from the spot where I stood. My ear was greatly
4640,ROGER.,"deceived respecting the distance, for I was not an hundred meters from"
4641,ROGER.,"the instrument. It was a bamboo at least twenty meters in height,"
4642,ROGER.,which had been fixed in a vertical situation by the sea-side. I
4643,ROGER.,remarked between each knot a slit about three centimeters long by a
4644,ROGER.,"centimeter and a half wide; these slits formed so many holes, which,"
4645,ROGER.,"when the wind introduced itself into them, gave agreeable and"
4646,ROGER.,diversified sounds. As the knots of this long bamboo were very
4647,ROGER.,"numerous, care had been takes to make holes in different directions,"
4648,ROGER.,"in order that, on whatever side the wind blew, it might always meet"
4649,ROGER.,with some of them. I cannot convey a better idea of the sound of this
4650,ROGER.,"instrument, than by comparing them to those of the"

4756,ROGER.,"owner, or his champion, {195} who was usually one of his near kinsmen;"
4757,ROGER.,"and, if any person should attempt to stop it in its rambles, a battle"

4762,ROGER.,
4763,ROGER.,Mr. Halhed gives a very curious account of this remarkable sacrifice:
4764,ROGER.,
4765,ROGER.,"""The Ashum-meed-Jugg does not merely consist in the performance of"
4766,ROGER.,"that ceremony which is open to the inspection of the world, namely, in"
4767,ROGER.,bringing a horse and sacrificing him; but Ashum-meed is to be taken in
4768,ROGER.,"a mystic signification, as implying that the sacrificer must look upon"
4769,ROGER.,"himself to be typified in that horse, such as he shall be described,"
4770,ROGER.,because the religious duty of the Ashum-meed-Jugg comprehends all
4771,ROGER.,"those other religious duties, to the performance of which all the wise"
4772,ROGER.,"and holy direct all their actions, and by which all the sincere"
4773,ROGER.,professors of every different faith aim at perfection: The mystic
4774,ROGER.,signification thereof is as follows:
4775,ROGER.,
4776,ROGER.,"""The head of that unblemished horse is the symbol of the morning; his"
4777,ROGER.,eyes are the sun; his breath the wind; his wide-opening mouth is the
4778,ROGER.,"Bishwaner, or that innate warmth which invigorates all the world: His"
4779,ROGER.,body typifies {196} one entire year; his back paradise; his belly the
4780,ROGER.,plains; his hoof this earth; his sides the four quarters of the
4781,ROGER.,heavens; the bones thereof the intermediate spaces between the four
4782,ROGER.,quarters; the rest of his limbs represent all distinct matter; the
4783,ROGER.,"places where those limbs meet, or his joints, imply the months and"
4784,ROGER.,"halves of the months, which are called _peche_ (or fortnights): His"
4785,ROGER.,"feet signify night and day; and night and day are of four kinds, 1."
4786,ROGER.,"the night and day of Birhma, 2. the night and day of angels, 3. the"
4787,ROGER.,"night and day of the world of the spirits of deceased ancestors, 4."
4788,ROGER.,the night and day of mortals; these four kinds are typified in his
4789,ROGER.,four feet. The rest of his bones are the constellations of the fixed
4790,ROGER.,"stars, which are the twenty-eight stages of the moon's course, called"
4791,ROGER.,the Lunar year; his flesh is the clouds; his food the sand; his
4792,ROGER.,tendons the rivers; his spleen and his liver the mountains; the hair
4793,ROGER.,"of his body the vegetables, and his long hair the trees: the fore part"
4794,ROGER.,"of his body typifies the first half of the day, and the hinder part"
4795,ROGER.,"the latter half; his yawning is the flash of the lightning, and his"
4796,ROGER.,turning himself is the thunder of the cloud: His urine represents the
4797,ROGER.,"rain, and his mental reflection is his only speech. The golden"
4798,ROGER.,"vessels, which are prepared before the horse is let loose, are the"
4799,ROGER.,"light of the day, and the place where those vessels are kept is a type"
4800,ROGER.,"of the Ocean {197} of the East; the silver vessels, which are prepared"
4801,ROGER.,"after the horse is let loose, are the light of the night; and the"
4802,ROGER.,place where those vessels are kept is a type of the Ocean of the West:
4803,ROGER.,these two sorts of vessels are always before and after the horse. The
4804,ROGER.,"Arabian horse, which, on account of its swiftness, is called Hy, is"
4805,ROGER.,"the performer of the journies of angels; the Tajee, which is of the"
4806,ROGER.,"race of Persian horses, is the performer of the journies of the"
4807,ROGER.,"Kundherps (or good spirits); the Wazba, which is of the race of the"
4808,ROGER.,"deformed Tazee horses, is the performer of the journies of the Jins,"
4809,ROGER.,"(or demons;) and the Ashoo, which is of the race of Turkish horses, is"
4810,ROGER.,"the performer of the journies of mankind. This one horse, which"
4811,ROGER.,"performs these several services, on account of his four different"
4812,ROGER.,"sorts of riders, obtains the four different appellations. The place"
4813,ROGER.,"where this horse remains is the great ocean, which signifies, the"
4814,ROGER.,"great spirit of Perm-Atma, or the Universal Soul, which proceeds also"
4815,ROGER.,"from that Perm-Atma, and is comprehended in the same Perm-Atma. The"
4816,ROGER.,"intent of this sacrifice is, that a man should consider himself to be"
4817,ROGER.,"in the place of that horse, and look upon all these articles as"
4818,ROGER.,"typified in himself; and, conceiving the Atma (or divine soul) to be"
4819,ROGER.,"an ocean, should let all thought of self be absorbed in that"
4820,ROGER.,"Atma.""--HALHED, _from Darul Shekuh_."

4838,ROGER.,bottom of which there is a little hole; this is put into a vessel with
4839,ROGER.,"water, and it runs full in a certain time. They begin their first"

4841,ROGER.,"subdivisions of time with a wooden hammer, upon a flat piece of iron"
4842,ROGER.,"or steel, of about ten inches in diameter, which is called a"
4843,ROGER.,"_garnial_, and gives a pretty smart sound, which can be heard at some"

4859,ROGER.,"They commonly make them one, two, or three yards long, about the"
4860,ROGER.,"thickness of a goose-quill, to burn in the pagods before their idols,"

4862,ROGER.,"sticks or ropes they coil, beginning at the centre, and so form a"

4864,ROGER.,"circle shall be one, two, or three spans diameter, and will last one,"

4888,ROGER.,"than their habits of obedience, or even their dread of his"
4889,ROGER.,"displeasure, and they accordingly began to plunder. The instant Nadir"

4892,ROGER.,private soldiers dismissed with the loss of their ears and noses. The

5068,ROGER.,which adorned and fertilised the vast extent of his dominions. They
5069,ROGER.,were not able to penetrate beyond the famous _Mouth of the Cow_. This
5070,ROGER.,"is an immense aperture, in a ridge of the mountains of Thibet, to"
5071,ROGER.,"which the natives of India have given this appellation, from the"

5075,ROGER.,precipitating itself into a large and deep bason at the foot of the

5172,ROGER.,"Shunkura, and the mountain Bindhyo, overlooking the country around,"
5173,ROGER.,"proudly vie with each other, there was the sacrifice of the great"
5174,ROGER.,"Sugura performed. That land, sacred and renowned, is the habitation of"
5175,ROGER.,"Rakshuses. At the command of Sugura, the hero Ungshooman, O Rama!"
5176,ROGER.,"eminent in archery, a mighty charioteer, was the attendant (of the"
5177,ROGER.,"horse.[5]) While the king was performing the sacrifice, a serpent,"
5178,ROGER.,"assuming the form of Ununta, rose from the earth, and seized the"
5179,ROGER.,"sacrificial horse. The sacrificial victim being stolen, all the"
5180,ROGER.,"priests, O son of Rughoo! going to the king, said, Thy consecrated"
5181,ROGER.,horse has been stolen by some one in the form of a serpent. Kill the
5182,ROGER.,"thief, and bring back the sacred horse. This interruption in the"
5183,ROGER.,"sacrifice portends evil to us all. Take those steps, O king! which may"
5184,ROGER.,lead to the completion of the sacrifice. Having heard the advice of
5185,ROGER.,"his instructors, the king, calling his sixty thousand sons into the"
5186,ROGER.,"assembly, said, I perceive that the Rakshuses have not been to this"
5187,ROGER.,great sacrifice. A sacrifice of the Nagas is now performing by the
5188,ROGER.,"sages, and some god, in the form of a serpent, {214} has stolen the"
5189,ROGER.,"devoted horse. Whoever he be, who, at the time of the Deeksha, has"
5190,ROGER.,"been the cause of this afflictive circumstance, this unhappy event,"
5191,ROGER.,"whether he be gone to Patala, or whether he remain in the waters, kill"
5192,ROGER.,"him, O sons! and bring back my victim. May success attend you, O my"
5193,ROGER.,"sons! At my command traverse the sea-girt earth, digging with mighty"
5194,ROGER.,"labour, till you obtain a sight of the horse; each one piercing the"
5195,ROGER.,"earth to the depth of a yojunga, go you in search of him who stole the"
5196,ROGER.,"sacred horse. Being consecrated by the Deeksha, I, with my grandson"
5197,ROGER.,"and my teachers, will remain with the sacrifice unfinished, till I"
5198,ROGER.,again behold my devoted horse.
5199,ROGER.,

5309,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"birds and the serpents. Having circumambulated him, and asked"
5310,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"concerning his welfare, Ungshooman {220} enquired for his paternal"
5311,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"relatives, and the stealer of the sacred victim. The mighty elephant"
5312,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"of the quarter hearing, replied, O son of Usumunja! thou wilt"
5313,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"accomplish thine intention, and speedily return with the horse. Having"
5314,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"heard this, he, with due respect, enquired, in regular succession, of"
5315,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,all the elephants of the quarters. Honoured by all these guardians of
5316,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"the eight sides of the earth, acquainted with speech, and eminent in"
5317,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"eloquence, he was told, Thou wilt return with the horse. Upon this"
5318,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"encouraging declaration, he swiftly went to the place where lay his"
5319,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"paternal relatives, the sons of Sugura, reduced to a heap of ashes."
5320,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"(At this sight) the son of Usumunja, overwhelmed with sorrow on"
5321,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"account of their death, cried out with excess of grief. In this state"
5322,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"of grief, the chief of men beheld, grazing near, the sacrificial"
5323,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"horse. The illustrious one, desirous of performing the funeral"
5324,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"obsequies of these sons of the king, looked around for a receptacle of"
5325,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"water, but in vain. Extending his eager view, he saw, O Rama! the"
5326,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"sovereign of birds, the uncle of his paternal relatives, Soopurna, in"
5327,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"size resembling a mountain. Vinuteya, of mighty prowess, addressed him"
5328,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"thus: Grieve not, O chief of men! this slaughter is approved by the"
5329,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,universe. These great ones were reduced to ashes by Kupila of
5330,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"unmeasurable might. It is not proper for thee, O wise one! to pour"
5331,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"common water upon {221} these ashes. Gunga, O chief of men! is the"
5332,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"eldest daughter of Himuvut. With her sacred stream, O valiant one!"
5333,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,perform the funeral ceremonies for thine ancestors. If the purifier of
5334,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"the world flow on them, reduced to a heap of ashes, these ashes, being"
5335,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"wetted by Gunga, the illuminator of the world, the sixty thousand sons"
5336,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,of thy grandfather will be received into heaven. May success attend
5337,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,thee! Bring Gunga to the earth from the residence of the gods. If thou
5338,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"art able, O chief of men! possessor of the ample share, let the"
5339,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"descent of Gunga be accomplished by thee. Take the horse, and go"

5361,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"placed him on the throne, he, O Raguva! retiring to the pleasant top"
5362,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"of Mount Himuvut, performed the most severe austerities. This"
5363,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"excellent sovereign of men, illustrious as the immortals, was"
5364,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,exceedingly desirous of the descent of Gunga; but not obtaining his

5366,SECTION THIRTY-FOUR.,"heaven, after having abode in the forest sacred to austerities,"

5435,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"Gunga! The eldest daughter of Himuvut, adored by the universe, having"
5436,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"heard the words of the lord of Ooma, was filled with anger, and"
5437,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"assuming, O Rama! a form of amazing size, with insupportable celerity,"
5438,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,fell from the air upon the auspicious head of Shiva. The goddess
5439,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"Gunga, irresistible, thought within herself, I will bear down Shunkura"
5440,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"with my stream, and enter Patala. The {226} divine Hura, the"
5441,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"three-eyed god, was aware of her proud resolution, and, being angry,"
5442,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"determined to prevent her design. The purifier, fallen upon the sacred"

5444,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"his Juta, resembling Himuvut, and was unable, by the greatest efforts,"
5445,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"to descend to the earth. From the borders of the orb of his Juta, the"
5446,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"goddess could not obtain regress, but wandered there for many series"

5449,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,
5450,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"""With these austerities, O son of Rughoo! Hura being greatly pleased,"

5453,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"with water conveying happiness, Hladinee,[19] Pavunee,[20] and"
5454,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"Nulinee,[21] directed their course eastward: while"
5455,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"Soochukohoo,[22] Seeta,[23] and Sindhoo,[24] three pellucid"
5456,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"mighty rivers, flowed to the west. The seventh of these streams"
5457,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"followed king Bhugee-rutha. The royal sage, the illustrious {227}"
5458,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"Bhugee-rutha, seated on a resplendent car, led the way, while Gunga"
5459,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"followed. Pouring down from the sky upon the head of Shunkura, and"
5460,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"afterwards upon the earth, her streams rolled along with a shrill"
5461,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"sound. The earth was willingly chosen by the fallen fishes, the"
5462,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"turtles, the porpoises, and the birds. The royal sages, the"
5463,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"Gundhurvas, the Yukshas, and the Siddhas, beheld her falling from the"

5469,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"atmosphere shone with the splendour of an hundred suns, while by the"
5470,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"uneasy porpoises, the serpents, and the fishes, the air was coruscated"

5472,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"a thousand directions, and the flights of water-fowl, the atmosphere"
5473,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"appeared filled with autumnal clouds. The water, pure from defilement,"
5474,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"falling from the head of Shunkura, and thence to the earth, ran in"
5475,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"some places with a rapid stream, in others in a tortuous current; here"
5476,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"widely spreading, there descending into caverns, and again spouting"
5477,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"upward; in some places it moved slowly, stream uniting with stream;"
5478,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"while repelled {228} in others, it rose upwards, and again fell to the"

5785,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"looks and incantations. Other accounts say, that, by looking at a"
5786,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"person, he deprives him of his senses, and then steals from him"
5787,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"something resembling the seed of a pomegranate, which he hides in the"
5788,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,calf of his leg. The _Jiggerkhar_ throws on the fire the grain before
5789,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"described, which thereupon spreads to the size of a dish, and he"
5790,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"distributes it amongst his fellows, to be eaten; which ceremony"
5791,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,concludes the life of the fascinated person. A _Jiggerkhar_ is able to
5792,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"communicate his art to another, which he does by learning him the"
5793,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"incantations, and by making him eat a bit of the liver-cake. If any"
5794,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"one cut open the calf of the magician's leg, extract the grain, and"
5795,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"give it to the afflicted person {242} to eat, he immediately recovers."

5799,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,nevertheless will not sink. In order to deprive any one of this wicked

5801,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"eyes with salt, suspend him for forty days in a subterraneous cavern,"

5812,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"native of Ormuz, who had lately, from being a Christian, turned"

5820,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"formerly in Sclavonia, and the country of the Triballes, as we learn"
5821,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"from Ortelius, who took the account from Pliny, who, upon the report"

5823,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"use among these people, and many others whom he mentions, as it is at"
5824,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"present here, especially among the Arabians who inhabit the western"
5825,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"coast of the Persian gulph, where this art is common. The way in which"
5826,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"they do it is only by the eyes and the mouth, keeping the eyes fixed"
5827,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"steadily upon the person whose heart they design to eat, and"
5828,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"pronouncing, between their teeth, I know not what diabolical words, by"
5829,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"virtue of which, and by the operation of the devil, the person, how"
5830,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"hale and strong soever, falls immediately into an unknown and"
5831,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"incurable disease, which makes him appear phthysical, consumes him"
5832,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"little by little, and at last destroys him. And this takes place"
5833,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"faster or slower as the heart is eaten, as they say; for these"
5834,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"sorcerers can either eat the whole or a part only; that is, can"
5835,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"consume it entirely and at once, or bit by bit, as they please. The"
5836,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"vulgar give it this name, because they believe that the devil, acting"
5837,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,upon {244} the imagination of the witch when she mutters her wicked
5838,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"words, represents invisibly to her the heart and entrails of the"
5839,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"patient, taken out of his body, and makes her devour them. In which"
5840,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"these wretches find so delightful a task, that very often, to satisfy"
5841,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"their appetite, without any impulse of resentment or enmity, they will"
5842,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"destroy innocent persons, and even their nearest relatives, as there"

5854,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"might better understand the truth of these black and devilish actions,"

5857,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"If he could eat the inside of a cucumber without opening it, as well"
5858,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"as the heart of a man? The sorcerer said yes; and, in order to {245}"

5860,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"steadily for some time, with his usual enchantments, and then told the"
5861,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"captain he had eaten the whole inside; and accordingly, when it was"

5863,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"the devil, of whom they make use in these operations, having, in the"

5878,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,some difficulty at first to confess her guilt; but seeing herself
5879,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"pressed with threats of death, and being led, in fact, to the public"
5880,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"square, where I saw her with the sick young man, she said, that though"
5881,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"she had not been the cause of his complaint, perhaps she could cure"
5882,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"{246} it, if they would let her remain alone with him, in his house,"
5883,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,without interruption; by which she tacitly confessed her witchcraft:
5884,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"For it is held certain in these countries, that these wicked women can"
5885,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"remove the malady which they have caused, if it be not come to the"
5886,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,last extremity. And of many remedies which they use to restore health
5887,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"to the sufferers, there is one very extraordinary, which is, that the"
5888,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"witch casts something out of her mouth, like the grain of a"
5889,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"pomegranate, which is believed to be a part of the heart that she had"
5890,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"eaten. The patient picks it up immediately, as part of his own"
5891,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"intestines, and greedily swallows it; and by this means, as if his"
5892,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"heart was replaced in his body, he recovers by degrees his health. I"
5893,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"dare not assure you of these things as certainly true, not having"
5894,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"myself seen them, surpassing as they do the course of nature. If they"
5895,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"are as is said, it can be only in appearance, by the illusions of the"
5896,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"devil; and if the afflicted recover actually their health, it is"
5897,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,because the same devil ceases to torment them. Without dwelling longer
5898,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"upon these curious speculations,--the witch having given hopes that"
5899,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"she would cure the patient, the officers promised that she should"
5900,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"receive no injury, and they were both sent home; but an archer was set"
5901,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"over her as a guard, that she might not escape.--PIETRO DELLA VALLE."

5907,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,The Calis and Pandaris are the protectresses of cities; each city has

5910,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"human victims. These objects of worship are not immortal, and they"
5911,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"take their name from the city over which they preside, or from the"
5912,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,form in which they are represented. They are commonly framed of a
5913,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"gigantic stature, having several arms, and the head surrounded with"

5921,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,Mr. Moor has a curious remark upon this subject:
5922,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,
5923,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"""Sani being among the astrologers of India, as well as with their"
5924,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"sapient brethren of Europe, a planet of malignant aspects, the"
5925,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,ill-omened raven may be deemed a fit _Vahan_ for such a dreaded being.
5926,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"But this is not, I think, a sufficient reason for the conspicuous"
5927,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,introduction of the raven into the mythological machinery of the Hindu
5928,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"system, so accurate, so connected, and so complete in all its parts;"
5929,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,although the investigations that it hath hitherto undergone have not
5930,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,fully developed or reached such points {248} of perfection. Now let me
5931,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"ask the reason, why, both in England and in India, the raven it so"
5932,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"rare a bird? It breeds every year, like the crow, and is much longer"
5933,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"lived; and while the latter bird abounds every where, to a degree"
5934,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"bordering on nuisance, a pair of ravens, for they are seldom seen"
5935,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"singly or in trios, are scarcely found duplicated in any place."
5936,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"Perhaps, take England or India over, two pair of ravens will not be"
5937,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"found, on an average, in the extent of five hundred or a thousand"
5938,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"acres. I know not, for I write where I have no access to books, if our"
5939,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,naturalists have sought the theory of this; or whether it may have
5940,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"first occurred to me, which it did while contemplating the character"
5941,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"and attributes of Sani, that the raven destroys its young; and if this"
5942,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"notion be well founded, and on no other can I account for the rareness"
5943,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"of the annual-breeding long-lived raven, we shall at once see the"
5944,SECTION THIRTY-FIVE.,"propriety of symbolizing it with Saturn, or Kronos, or Time, devouring"
