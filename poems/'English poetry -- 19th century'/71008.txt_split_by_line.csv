248,CHARADES--,Introductory Notice.
249,CHARADES--,
250,CHARADES--,
251,CHARADES--,"Of all literary reputations, that of the Society Poet is probably"
252,CHARADES--,enjoyed upon the most hazardous and uncertain of tenures. To be
253,CHARADES--,"successful at all, he must win the instant recognition of his immediate"
254,CHARADES--,contemporaries; he must be in touch with the thought of his own
255,CHARADES--,"generation; he must reflect its sentiments, chime with its humour, and"
256,CHARADES--,satirise its manners; and in proportion to the popularity of his
257,CHARADES--,"productions with the public of his own day, will probably be the neglect"
258,CHARADES--,with which they are treated by the public of a generation later. This
259,CHARADES--,"neglect on the part of posterity is to some extent comprehensible, even"
260,CHARADES--,"reasonable, for the poem of manners is often nothing more than purely"
261,CHARADES--,"ephemeral in character, and indebted to accident for even its"
262,CHARADES--,"contemporary success, the measure of which is not to be relied upon as"
263,CHARADES--,a fair criterion of its intrinsic excellence. Still posterity is apt to
264,CHARADES--,"be careless and indiscriminating in its neglectfulness. True wit, true"
265,CHARADES--,"humour, true grace and refinement are qualities that should command"
266,CHARADES--,something more than a fleeting popularity; but even where the public is
267,CHARADES--,"content, on the strength of the critical verdict of a past generation,"
268,CHARADES--,"to admit that, beyond his fellows, So-and-So was graceful, humorous, and"
269,CHARADES--,"witty, it is often content to let the matter rest there, and not trouble"
270,CHARADES--,itself with inquiring into the evidence upon which such verdict was
271,CHARADES--,"founded. Our own century can count not a few poets of barren reputation,"
272,CHARADES--,"much admired, on the strength of old tradition, but very little read."
273,CHARADES--,"George Canning’s wit was, and is, proverbial. Most people have heard of"
274,CHARADES--,"the “Anti-Jacobin Review,” and have some slight knowledge of the “Needy"
275,CHARADES--,Knife-grinder;” beyond that it would puzzle most people to supply any
276,CHARADES--,specific information as to anything that he wrote that justifies his
277,CHARADES--,"reputation. Captain Charles Morris, of the First Life Guards and The"
278,CHARADES--,"Beefsteak Club, wrote enough verse (and very delightful verse it is) to"
279,CHARADES--,"fill a bulky volume, in addition to much more that for sufficient"
280,CHARADES--,reasons was not re-published in volume form. Part of one line of one
281,CHARADES--,"poem, “The sweet shady side of Pall Mall,” alone survives, apparently"
282,CHARADES--,for the especial benefit of leader-writers in the daily papers.
283,CHARADES--,"Winthrop Mackworth Praed, most precocious and most prolific of the poets"
284,CHARADES--,"of society, began his literary career as a schoolboy, and for twenty"
285,CHARADES--,years flooded the periodical literature of his day with songs and
286,CHARADES--,"satires, ballads and legends innumerable, all of which are forgotten. It"
287,CHARADES--,"is not quite fair, perhaps, to say all, for some half-dozen pieces at"
288,CHARADES--,"most survive, and have done duty with monotonous regularity, as"
289,CHARADES--,"representative specimens of his verse, in every volume of poetical"
290,CHARADES--,selections of the _Vers de Société_ order that has seen the light for
291,CHARADES--,"the last quarter of a century. Thus, Praed’s “Good Night to the Season”"
292,CHARADES--,"has become a well-known poem; it is witty, full of brilliant antithesis"
293,CHARADES--,"and word-play, a fairly typical example of Praed’s style; still it palls"
294,CHARADES--,"by too frequent repetition, and Praed did much work that is quite equal"
295,CHARADES--,"to it, and some that is even better, and better worth quoting. That"
296,CHARADES--,"Praed’s contemporaries thought too highly of him is not, I think, open"
297,CHARADES--,"to question; that he has, since his death, been unreasonably neglected"
298,CHARADES--,"is, at least, equally true. Of his earlier work much is very weak."
299,CHARADES--,"Youthful poems, if noticeable for the precocity of their writers, are"
300,CHARADES--,not usually remarkable for their strength or originality. In his more
301,CHARADES--,mature days he perpetrated a good deal of verse that is not much above
302,CHARADES--,"the standard of the “Keepsake” and “Book of Beauty,” in the pages of"
303,CHARADES--,which polite publications one is quite content to let it rest
304,CHARADES--,undisturbed; but beyond all this he wrote a great deal that deserves to
305,CHARADES--,"live, and that, so far, has hardly had a fair chance of life given to"
306,CHARADES--,"it. In the first instance, Praed was himself responsible for the"
307,CHARADES--,smothering of his offspring. He seems to have been very indifferent
308,CHARADES--,"about the ultimate fate of his productions, or about the permanence of"
309,CHARADES--,his own literary reputation. Everything that he wrote was contributed to
310,CHARADES--,"periodicals; he never published a book of his own, nor apparently"
311,CHARADES--,"contemplated the collection of any of his poems into a volume, with the"
312,CHARADES--,"exception of some of his political squibs, which, in the last year of"
313,CHARADES--,"his life, he had printed for private circulation among friends. When he"
314,CHARADES--,"died, there was a scheme set on foot for collecting and publishing his"
315,CHARADES--,"poems, and the editorial work was entrusted to his early friend, the"
316,CHARADES--,"Rev. Derwent Coleridge. Four-and-twenty years after, Mrs. Praed being"
317,CHARADES--,"then dead also, the editor completed his labours, and the book was at"
318,CHARADES--,length given to the world. Mr. Coleridge did his work only _too_ well.
319,CHARADES--,"Every fragment of childish verse, all the boyish contributions to the"
320,CHARADES--,"_Etonian_, every school exercise, every bit of inane, cut-and-dried"
321,CHARADES--,sentimentality that could be hunted up and identified in the pages of
322,CHARADES--,"_Friendship’s Offerings_, and the like, were rigorously printed, and"
323,CHARADES--,poor Praed’s handfuls of corn were ruthlessly smothered under his
324,CHARADES--,bushels of chaff. One merit was claimed for the book--that of being
325,CHARADES--,"complete. That merit, unfortunately, did not belong to it, as, for some"
326,CHARADES--,"unexplained reason, the political poems, which are numerous and witty,"
327,CHARADES--,"were altogether excluded. This book, in two volumes, was published in"
328,CHARADES--,"1864. In 1866 Sir George Young, Praed’s nephew, edited a small volume of"
329,CHARADES--,"selections, which was compiled with taste and judgment, as far as it"
330,CHARADES--,went; but the book was as meagre and insufficient as its predecessor had
331,CHARADES--,been bulky and redundant. Both these books have long been out of print
332,CHARADES--,"and unattainable, and in offering what claims to be a fairly"
333,CHARADES--,"representative selection of the best work of the poet, of whom the most"
334,CHARADES--,"finished literary artist of our day, Mr. Frederick Locker, remarks, that"
335,CHARADES--,"“in his peculiar vein he has never been equalled, and, it may safely be"
336,CHARADES--,"affirmed, can never be excelled,” it is believed that the present volume"
337,CHARADES--,of “The Canterbury Poets” will supply a sensibly-felt want in modern
338,CHARADES--,English poetic literature.
339,CHARADES--,
340,CHARADES--,Winthrop Mackworth Praed was the third and youngest son of William
341,CHARADES--,"Mackworth Praed, serjeant-at-law, who was the first chairman of the"
342,CHARADES--,"Audit Board, a post which he filled for many years. He was born on the"
343,CHARADES--,"26th July 1802, at 35 John Street, Bedford Row, his father’s London"
344,CHARADES--,"residence, although Bitton House, at Teignmouth, the country seat of the"
345,CHARADES--,"family, was always regarded as his paternal home. The original surname"
346,CHARADES--,"of the family was Mackworth, the additional name of Praed having been"
347,CHARADES--,"assumed some generations earlier. Praed’s mother was a Miss Winthrop, a"
348,CHARADES--,member of a family descended from the same stock as the American
349,CHARADES--,Winthrops. He had the misfortune to lose her while he was yet very
350,CHARADES--,"young, but her place was, so far as a mother’s place can be filled,"
351,CHARADES--,"worthily taken by an elder sister, to whom he was all his life sincerely"
352,CHARADES--,"attached, and who seems to have been the inspiring genius of his"
353,CHARADES--,"earliest poetical efforts. Young Praed was always, it appears, a"
354,CHARADES--,"constitutionally delicate lad, with a strong taste for studious"
355,CHARADES--,"pursuits, and small inclination, comparatively, for the rougher"
356,CHARADES--,"pleasures of a schoolboy,--although he was not altogether without mark"
357,CHARADES--,in the cricket-field and on the river. The fancy for verse-writing
358,CHARADES--,"developed itself in him at a very early age, and Mr. Derwent Coleridge"
359,CHARADES--,has preserved from oblivion several of his precocious efforts. There is
360,CHARADES--,"nothing particularly remarkable in these early verses, beyond those of"
361,CHARADES--,"other juvenile poets, so far at least as the thought is concerned: the"
362,CHARADES--,"best of them is, perhaps, a letter addressed to his elder sister Susan,"
363,CHARADES--,"“The Forget-me-not,” in which Praed’s fine sense of form is"
364,CHARADES--,"conspicuously evidenced. This was, no doubt, to a great extent"
365,CHARADES--,"instinctive, but his singularly finished style owed a great deal to his"
366,CHARADES--,"father’s severe criticism, Serjeant Praed being a man of sound literary"
367,CHARADES--,"taste, and a great stickler for form."
368,CHARADES--,
369,CHARADES--,"In 1814 young Winthrop went to Eton, where his poetical proclivities"
370,CHARADES--,"were yet further encouraged by his tutor, Dr. Hawtrey. Two Eton"
371,CHARADES--,"periodicals, _The College Magazine_ and _Horæ Otiosæ_, were conducted by"
372,CHARADES--,"some of the boys in the year 1819, and circulated in MS. It does not"
373,CHARADES--,"appear that Praed contributed to either of these, but when they were"
374,CHARADES--,"dropped in 1820, he brought out a MS. journal of his own, the _Apis"
375,CHARADES--,"Matina_, of which six numbers were published in the months of April,"
376,CHARADES--,"May, June, and July. About half the contents of these papers were"
377,CHARADES--,"written by Praed himself, the other contributors being the Honourable"
378,CHARADES--,"Francis Curzon and Walter Trower, afterwards Bishop of Gibraltar. About"
379,CHARADES--,this time Charles Knight printed at Windsor a selection of the poetry of
380,CHARADES--,"the _College Magazine_, and Praed and some other ambitious spirits set"
381,CHARADES--,on foot a project for a regularly published _College Magazine_. Knight
382,CHARADES--,"agreed to undertake the printing, subject to certain guarantees, which"
383,CHARADES--,"were obtained, and in October 1820 appeared the first number of the"
384,CHARADES--,"_Etonian_, perhaps the most remarkable schoolboy magazine ever produced."
385,CHARADES--,"Praed and Walter Blunt were joint editors, the bulk of the contents of"
386,CHARADES--,the _Magazine_ being supplied by the former. His literary fecundity at
387,CHARADES--,"this time was, considering his age, remarkable. The contributions to the"
388,CHARADES--,Magazine were supposed to be supplied by the members of an association
389,CHARADES--,"called “The King of Clubs.” They were known by _noms de plume_, Praed’s"
390,CHARADES--,"being that of Peregrine Courtenay, the President of the Club. There was"
391,CHARADES--,"a prose introduction to each number, describing the proceedings of the"
392,CHARADES--,"Club, the whole of which was in every case written by Praed. During the"
393,CHARADES--,ten months’ existence of the _Magazine_ he also contributed to it the
394,CHARADES--,"following poems, all of some length:--“The Eve of Battle,” “Changing"
395,CHARADES--,"Quarters,” “The County Ball,” “Gog,” “Surly Hall,” “Reminiscences of my"
396,CHARADES--,"Youth,” “To Julia,” “To Julio,” “To Florence,” “The Bachelor,” “How to"
397,CHARADES--,"Rhyme for Love,” etc., as well as several smaller poems. The staff of"
398,CHARADES--,the _Etonian_ otherwise comprised a good array of names. Among them were
399,CHARADES--,"the Honourable William Ashley, Edmond Beales, William Chrichton,"
400,CHARADES--,"Honourable Francis Curzon, R. Durnford, William Henry Ord, Thomas Powys"
401,CHARADES--,"Outram, Walter Trower--all boys then at Eton. One Oxonian--Henry"
402,CHARADES--,"Neech--contributed, and five Cantabs--Henry Nelson Coleridge, John"
403,CHARADES--,"Moultrie, John Louis Petit, William Sydney Walker, and another. Among"
404,CHARADES--,the anonymous contributors were R. Streatfield and J. A. Kinglake.
405,CHARADES--,
406,CHARADES--,"The _Etonian_ appeared regularly every month until July 1821, when it"
407,CHARADES--,was discontinued in consequence of the editor and principal contributor
408,CHARADES--,going up to Cambridge. In Charles Knight’s “Passages of a Working Life”
409,CHARADES--,"there occur, about this date, many references to his first connection"
410,CHARADES--,with Praed and his friends in the conduct of the _Etonian_. He
411,CHARADES--,"says:--“The character of Peregrine Courtenay, given in an ‘Account of"
412,CHARADES--,"the proceedings which led to the publication of the _Etonian_,’"
413,CHARADES--,"furnishes no satisfactory idea of the youthful Winthrop Mackworth Praed,"
414,CHARADES--,when he is described as one ‘possessed of sound good sense rather than
415,CHARADES--,of brilliancy of genius.’ His ‘general acquirements and universal
416,CHARADES--,"information’ are fitly recorded, as well as his acquaintance with ‘the"
417,CHARADES--,world at large.’ But the kindness that lurks under sarcasm; the wisdom
418,CHARADES--,that wears the mask of fun; the half melancholy that is veiled by
419,CHARADES--,levity--these qualities very soon struck me as far out of the ordinary
420,CHARADES--,indications of precocious talent. It is not easy to separate my
421,CHARADES--,recollections of the Praed of Eton from those of the Praed of Cambridge.
422,CHARADES--,"The Etonian of 1820 was natural and unaffected in his talk, neither shy"
423,CHARADES--,"nor presuming; proud, without a tinge of vanity; somewhat reserved, but"
424,CHARADES--,ever courteous; giving few indications of the susceptibility of the
425,CHARADES--,"poet, but ample evidence of the laughing satirist; a pale and slight"
426,CHARADES--,"youth, who had looked upon the aspects of society with the keen"
427,CHARADES--,"perception of a clever manhood; one who had, moreover, seen in human"
428,CHARADES--,"life something more than follies to be ridiculed by the gay jest, or"
429,CHARADES--,"scouted by the sarcastic sneer. His writings then, especially his poems,"
430,CHARADES--,occasionally exhibited that remarkable union of pathos with wit and
431,CHARADES--,"humour which attested the originality of his genius, as it was"
432,CHARADES--,subsequently displayed in maturer efforts.”
433,CHARADES--,
434,CHARADES--,During Praed’s second year at Cambridge he wrote to Charles Knight (who
435,CHARADES--,"was then contemplating establishing himself in London), to the effect"
436,CHARADES--,that he should take up no periodical work until Knight started a
437,CHARADES--,publication of his own. In consequence of this communication Knight
438,CHARADES--,"visited Cambridge in December 1822, where he spent a pleasant week with"
439,CHARADES--,"Praed and his friends, making the acquaintance of Macaulay, Maiden, and"
440,CHARADES--,"Derwent Coleridge, and there and then settled the general plan of"
441,CHARADES--,"Knight’s _Quarterly Magazine_, the first number of which was shortly"
442,CHARADES--,afterwards brought out.
443,CHARADES--,
444,CHARADES--,"Praed wrote “Castle Vernon,” the introductory portion of the new"
445,CHARADES--,"_Magazine_, of which, for some numbers, he may be considered to have"
446,CHARADES--,"been the guiding spirit, although the responsible editorship was vested"
447,CHARADES--,in Knight himself. The principal contributors were Winthrop Mackworth
448,CHARADES--,"Praed, who used two _noms de plume_ (Peregrine Courtenay, and Vyvyan"
449,CHARADES--,"Joyeuse), Thomas Babington Macaulay (Tristram Merton), John Moultrie"
450,CHARADES--,"(Gerard Montgomery), Derwent Coleridge (Davenant Cecil), William Sidney"
451,CHARADES--,"Walker (Edward Hazelfoot), Henry Maiden (Hamilton Murray), and Henry"
452,CHARADES--,Nelson Coleridge (Joseph Haller). Praed’s prose style is bright and
453,CHARADES--,"lively. The “Castle Vernon” papers show it at about its best, but their"
454,CHARADES--,interest generally is very local and ephemeral. There are some clever
455,CHARADES--,little caricatures of some of the principal contributors sketched in
456,CHARADES--,"here and there, one of which, as an early portrait of Macaulay, it may"
457,CHARADES--,be worth while to reproduce:--
458,CHARADES--,
459,CHARADES--,"“‘Tristram Merton, come into court!’ There came up a short, manly"
460,CHARADES--,"figure, marvellously upright, with a bad neckcloth, and one hand in his"
461,CHARADES--,waist-coat pocket. Of regular beauty he had little to boast; but in
462,CHARADES--,"faces where there is an expression of great power, or great good-humour,"
463,CHARADES--,"or of both, you do not regret its absence."
464,CHARADES--,
465,CHARADES--,"“‘They were glorious days,’ he said, with a bend and a look of"
466,CHARADES--,"chivalrous gallantry to the circle around him, ‘they were glorious days"
467,CHARADES--,"for old Athens when all she held of witty and of wise, of brave and of"
468,CHARADES--,"beautiful, was collected in the drawing room of Aspasia. In those, the"
469,CHARADES--,"brightest and noblest times of Greece, there was no feeling so strong as"
470,CHARADES--,"the devotion of youth, no talisman of such virtue as the smile of"
471,CHARADES--,"beauty. Aspasia was the arbitress of peace and war, the queen of arts"
472,CHARADES--,"and arms, the Pallas of the spear and the pen; we have looked back to"
473,CHARADES--,those golden hours with transport and with longing. Here our classical
474,CHARADES--,dreams shall in some sort wear a dress of reality. He who has not the
475,CHARADES--,piety of a Socrates may at least fall down before as lovely a divinity;
476,CHARADES--,he who has not the power of a Pericles may at least kneel before as
477,CHARADES--,beautiful an Aspasia.’
478,CHARADES--,
479,CHARADES--,"“His tone had just so much of earnest, that what he said was felt as a"
480,CHARADES--,"compliment, and just so much banter that it was felt to be nothing more."
481,CHARADES--,As he concluded he dropped on one knee and paused.
482,CHARADES--,
483,CHARADES--,"“‘Tristram,’ said the Attorney-General, ‘we really are sorry to cramp a"
484,CHARADES--,culprit in his line of defence; but the time of the court must not be
485,CHARADES--,taken up. If you can speak ten words to the purpose’------
486,CHARADES--,
487,CHARADES--,"“‘Prythee, Frederic,’ retorted the other, ‘leave me to manage my own"
488,CHARADES--,"course. I have an arduous journey to run; and, in such a circle, like"
489,CHARADES--,"the poor prince in the _Arabian Tales_, I must be frozen into stone"
490,CHARADES--,before I can finish my task without turning to the right or the left.’
491,CHARADES--,
492,CHARADES--,"“‘For the love you bear us, a truce to your similes: they shall be"
493,CHARADES--,felony without benefit of clergy; and silence for an hour shall be the
494,CHARADES--,penalty.’
495,CHARADES--,
496,CHARADES--,"“‘A penalty for similes! horrible! Paul of Russia prohibited round hats,"
497,CHARADES--,"Chihu of China denounced white teeth, but this is atrocious!’"
498,CHARADES--,
499,CHARADES--,"“‘I beseech you, Tristram, if you can for a moment forget your"

505,CHARADES--,
506,CHARADES--,"Knight’s _Quarterly_ was started with much spirit, and promised to"
507,CHARADES--,become a great success. Much was hoped for from the co-operation of
508,CHARADES--,"Macaulay, but after the appearance of the first number he was compelled"
509,CHARADES--,"to withdraw his name from the list of contributors, although with much"
510,CHARADES--,"regret, in deference to the wishes of his family, whose religious"
511,CHARADES--,"scruples, it is to be presumed, were alarmed at the frivolous character"
512,CHARADES--,"of the publication. The difficulty was subsequently surmounted, and"
513,CHARADES--,Macaulay resumed his connection with the _Magazine_ with the third
514,CHARADES--,"number. His contributions to it were noteworthy, and included his fine"
515,CHARADES--,"poems of “Ivry” and “Moncontour,” and the “Songs of the Civil War.” In"
516,CHARADES--,"the interval, Praed worked hard to fill the void caused by Macaulay’s"
517,CHARADES--,"defection, and his contributions in prose and verse make up about"
518,CHARADES--,one-third of the contents of the second number of the _Magazine_. In
519,CHARADES--,"this number was published the first canto of his unfinished poem, “The"
520,CHARADES--,Troubadour.” With De Quincey and Barry St. Leger added to the staff of
521,CHARADES--,"the _Magazine_, its prospects appeared bright enough, but dissensions"
522,CHARADES--,"arose among the contributors, which finally led to its being"
523,CHARADES--,discontinued. It is impossible to say now what were the exact grounds of
524,CHARADES--,"quarrel. It appears evident, however, that Knight was properly tenacious"
525,CHARADES--,"of his position as responsible editor, and declined to admit the"
526,CHARADES--,irresponsible interference of his undergraduate staff. Praed seems to
527,CHARADES--,"have become jealous, and impatient of editorial supervision, and seceded"
528,CHARADES--,"from the _Magazine_, carrying most of his friends with him. Knight’s"
529,CHARADES--,"_Quarterly_ ceased to appear, therefore, after the publication of the"
530,CHARADES--,sixth number. An attempt was subsequently made to carry it on with
531,CHARADES--,"another staff, but the character of the publication was materially"
532,CHARADES--,"altered, and in its new form it failed to command popularity. Charles"
533,CHARADES--,"Knight had published a rather bitter notice in No. 6 of the _Magazine_,"
534,CHARADES--,to which Praed replied in a letter addressed to the _Cambridge
535,CHARADES--,"Chronicle_. Knight wrote a rejoinder, and there the matter ended. Two"
536,CHARADES--,"months later, however, Praed called upon Knight of his own accord, and"
537,CHARADES--,"friendly intercourse was resumed between them, so that in the Spring of"
538,CHARADES--,1826 we find Praed again co-operating with Knight and Barry St. Leger in
539,CHARADES--,"the conduct of a new periodical. This was _The Brazen Head_, a cheap"
540,CHARADES--,"weekly publication, that was designed to deal with current events in a"
541,CHARADES--,"humorous manner. The Friar Bacon legend was utilised as a framework, and"
542,CHARADES--,"the Friar and the Head, under Praed’s direction, discoursed wittily"
543,CHARADES--,"together, week by week, upon the topics of the day. “We had,” said"
544,CHARADES--,"Knight, “four weeks of this pleasantry: and, what was not an advantage,"
545,CHARADES--,"we had nearly all the amusement to ourselves, for the number of our"
546,CHARADES--,purchasers was not legion.” So _The Brazen Head_ went the way of its
547,CHARADES--,"predecessor. Brief though its existence was, it contained some of"
548,CHARADES--,Winthrop Praed’s most charming and characteristic verse. The opening
549,CHARADES--,"poem of the first number, “The Chant of the Brazen Head,” is in"
550,CHARADES--,particular unsurpassable among his compositions.
551,CHARADES--,
552,CHARADES--,Praed’s literary occupations were not permitted to interfere with his
553,CHARADES--,"University work to any serious extent, although they absorbed most of"
554,CHARADES--,"his interest. The Rev. Derwent Coleridge says, with reference to his"
555,CHARADES--,"University career, ‘There can be no doubt that he might have attained"
556,CHARADES--,"higher distinction as a scholar by a course of systematic study, for he"
557,CHARADES--,showed in after life both the power of thorough investigation and a
558,CHARADES--,"sense of its value; but the bent of his genius, and perhaps the state of"
559,CHARADES--,"his bodily health, inclined him to a more discursive occupation. As it"
560,CHARADES--,"was, though he failed as a competitor for the University scholarship,"
561,CHARADES--,"the long and shining list of his academic honours bore full testimony,"
562,CHARADES--,"not merely to his extraordinary talent, but to the high character of his"
563,CHARADES--,scholastic attainments.
564,CHARADES--,
565,CHARADES--,"“In 1822 he gained Sir William Browne’s medal for the Greek Ode, and for"
566,CHARADES--,"the Epigrams; in 1823 the same medal a second time for the Greek Ode,"
567,CHARADES--,with the first prize for English and Latin declamation in his college.
568,CHARADES--,"In 1824, Sir William Browne’s medal a second time for Epigrams. In 1823"
569,CHARADES--,and 1824 he also gained the Chancellor’s medal for English
570,CHARADES--,"verse--‘Australasia’ being the subject the former year, and ‘Athens’ in"
571,CHARADES--,"the latter. In the classical tripos his name appeared twice in the list,"
572,CHARADES--,"a high position, yet scarcely adding to the reputation which he already"
573,CHARADES--,enjoyed. In 1827 he was successful in the examination for a Trinity
574,CHARADES--,"Fellowship, and in 1830 he completed his University triumphs by gaining"
575,CHARADES--,the Seatonian prize.”
576,CHARADES--,
577,CHARADES--,"On leaving Cambridge, Praed practised for a while at the bar, apparently"
578,CHARADES--,with no great success. Politics at this time engaged his attention more
579,CHARADES--,"particularly, and in 1830 he was returned to Parliament for the first"
580,CHARADES--,"time, as member for the soon-to-be-extinguished borough of St. Germains."
581,CHARADES--,"Praed had been a rival of Macaulay’s for the leadership of the Union,"
582,CHARADES--,and much was expected of him as a speaker. Of course he disappointed
583,CHARADES--,"expectations, but his contributions to the debate on the Reform Bill of"
584,CHARADES--,"1830, although not brilliant, were not ineffective. He was the mover of"
585,CHARADES--,two amendments: one that freeholds in boroughs should confer borough and
586,CHARADES--,"not county votes; and the other, in support of which his most successful"
587,CHARADES--,"speech was delivered, was a scheme of minority representation, that"
588,CHARADES--,"appears to have been identical with that which has been, until recently,"
589,CHARADES--,in force in three-cornered constituencies.
590,CHARADES--,
591,CHARADES--,"St. Germains having been disfranchised, Praed in 1832 unsuccessfully"
592,CHARADES--,"contested St. Ives, in Cornwall, where he had some family influence."
593,CHARADES--,"Being excluded from Parliament, he turned his attention to political"
594,CHARADES--,"journalism, and became a leader-writer on the _Morning Post_, to which"
595,CHARADES--,paper also he contributed numerous anonymous political squibs. Praed
596,CHARADES--,"began his career as a Liberal, but about this time he became a convert"
597,CHARADES--,to Conservative opinions. Of this change of front he himself writes to
598,CHARADES--,a friend: “My old college opinions have been considerably modified by
599,CHARADES--,subsequent acquaintance with the world and observation of things _as
600,CHARADES--,"they are_. I am not going to stem a torrent, but I should like to"
601,CHARADES--,confine its fury within some bounds.... So my part in political matters
602,CHARADES--,"will probably expose me to all sorts of abuse for ratting, and so forth."
603,CHARADES--,"I abandon the party, if ever I belonged to it, in which my friends and"
604,CHARADES--,"my interests are both to be found, and I adopt one where I can hope to"
605,CHARADES--,"earn nothing but a barren reputation, and the consciousness of meaning"
606,CHARADES--,well.”
607,CHARADES--,
608,CHARADES--,His connection with the _Morning Post_ led to a personal acquaintance
609,CHARADES--,with the leaders of the Tory party; and overtures having been made to
610,CHARADES--,"him in 1835 to join Sir Robert Peel’s Administration, he accepted the"
611,CHARADES--,"post of Secretary to the Board of Control, and re-entered Parliament as"
612,CHARADES--,"member for Great Yarmouth. In the same year he married Helen, daughter"
613,CHARADES--,"of George Bogle, Esq."
614,CHARADES--,
615,CHARADES--,Sir Robert Peel’s Government came to a sudden and untimely end in about
616,CHARADES--,"three months, and with it ended Praed’s brief career as a minister."
617,CHARADES--,
618,CHARADES--,"In 1837 he retired from Great Yarmouth, and was returned for Aylesbury,"
619,CHARADES--,"which borough he continued to represent until his death, which occurred"
620,CHARADES--,"in 1839. His health, never robust, is said to have been permanently"
621,CHARADES--,"affected by his exertions at the Great Yarmouth election of 1834, and to"
622,CHARADES--,this has been attributed the development of the fatal lung disease to
623,CHARADES--,which he fell a victim. The winter of 1838-39 he spent at St. Leonard’s
624,CHARADES--,"with his wife and two infant daughters, returning to London for the"
625,CHARADES--,"meeting of Parliament in February 1839, when his general health appeared"
626,CHARADES--,to have improved. His energy was untiring: he was constant in his
627,CHARADES--,"attendance during the seven nights’ debate on the Corn Laws, and in May,"
628,CHARADES--,"when the House adjourned, consequent upon a change of Government, he"
629,CHARADES--,paid a flying visit to Cambridge in his official capacity of Deputy High
630,CHARADES--,"Steward of the University. The weather was very severe, and on his"
631,CHARADES--,returning to London his health was visibly breaking up. He continued to
632,CHARADES--,"attend in his place in the House of Commons, however, until the middle"
633,CHARADES--,"of June, when he paired for the remainder of the Session with Lord"
634,CHARADES--,Arundel. On the 15th of July he was dead.
635,CHARADES--,
636,CHARADES--,During the last ten or twelve years of his life Praed was a constant
637,CHARADES--,"contributor of verse to the periodicals of his day, although he was"
638,CHARADES--,never associated with any purely literary undertaking in the same
639,CHARADES--,intimate manner as he was in the case of Knight’s _Quarterly Magazine_.
640,CHARADES--,Charles Knight engaged his and John Moultrie’s co-operation in
641,CHARADES--,"_Friendship’s Offering_ for 1827, which he, Knight, edited for Smith &"
642,CHARADES--,"Elder. Praed contributed the “Red Fisherman,” the only one of his"
643,CHARADES--,legendary ballads that has achieved any lasting popularity. Praed’s
644,CHARADES--,"original title for this poem was “The Devil’s Decoy,” which “some"
645,CHARADES--,"blockhead in the confidence of the publishers” thought fit, on his own"
646,CHARADES--,"responsibility, to alter to “The Red Fisherman.” Praed was very angry,"
647,CHARADES--,"and was disposed to regard Charles Knight as responsible, and it was"
648,CHARADES--,with difficulty that another rupture between the old friends was
649,CHARADES--,"averted. “The Red Fisherman” has been frequently quoted, and it has been"
650,CHARADES--,"the fashion to regard it as Praed’s happiest effort in ballad writing,"
651,CHARADES--,although in what respect it can be deemed superior to “The Bridal of
652,CHARADES--,"Belmont,” “The Haunted Tree,” “The Teufelhaus,”--which is even more"
653,CHARADES--,"weirdly powerful--it is impossible to say. “The Troubadour,” Praed’s"
654,CHARADES--,"longest poem, contains much that is very charming. The first two cantos"
655,CHARADES--,of it were published in Knight’s _Quarterly_. Praed’s secession from the
656,CHARADES--,_Magazine_ interrupted the continuation. Only a portion of the third
657,CHARADES--,"canto was ever written. The poem is very indeterminate in character, and"
658,CHARADES--,"might have been carried on indefinitely, as each canto brings the hero"
659,CHARADES--,"into a new field of adventure, and supplies a tale or episode complete"
660,CHARADES--,"in itself. The poem, even as far as it was published, is too lengthy"
661,CHARADES--,"for insertion _in extenso_, but selected lyrics from it will be found in"
662,CHARADES--,this volume.
663,CHARADES--,
664,CHARADES--,"Praed’s claim to distinction, however, rests entirely upon his Poetry of"
665,CHARADES--,"Life and Manners. As a writer of what, for want of a better name, we"
666,CHARADES--,"call _Vers de Société_, he was in his time unapproachable, and has"
667,CHARADES--,"hardly, at any time, been surpassed. Verse-writing of this class in"
668,CHARADES--,Praed’s early days had sunk to a very low ebb. Neither Canning’s wit nor
669,CHARADES--,Moore’s gay fancy inspired the vapid scribblers who filled albums and
670,CHARADES--,"keepsakes with “Lines to Ladies’ Portraits,”"
671,CHARADES--,
672,CHARADES--,"“Soft songs to Julia’s cockatoo,"
673,CHARADES--,Fierce odes to Famine and to Slaughter.”
674,CHARADES--,
675,CHARADES--,Praed taught his contemporaries to be natural. He had a remarkable
676,CHARADES--,"fluency of expression. He was humorous, witty, and good-natured; he was"
677,CHARADES--,"a man of the world, and knew his world well, gauged its weaknesses with"
678,CHARADES--,"accuracy, and judged them with the leniency of a good-humoured worldly"
679,CHARADES--,"philosopher, contriving, meanwhile, not to forfeit his own character for"
680,CHARADES--,honesty and healthiness of mind. There is nothing very deep about
681,CHARADES--,"Praed’s poetry, yet is it not entirely superficial. He had keen insight"
682,CHARADES--,"and plenty of discrimination, but for great passion or sustained power"
683,CHARADES--,he had no capabilities. Lightly and gracefully he skated over the thin
684,CHARADES--,"surface ice of sentiment, not ignorant of, yet with little desire to"
685,CHARADES--,"fathom, the unknown depths of passion and suffering that lay beneath."
686,CHARADES--,"“The genius of gentleman” claimed for Horace by the late Lord Lytton,"
687,CHARADES--,belonged to Praed in no common degree. No man equally witty and
688,CHARADES--,brilliant was ever more perfectly well-bred in his writings: without
689,CHARADES--,"prudery, affectation, or cant, he was never slangy, suggestive, or"
690,CHARADES--,irreverent: he even achieved the difficult art of writing political
691,CHARADES--,satires that lost none of their point from the fact of their being free
692,CHARADES--,"from coarseness or personality. He was a typical society poet,"
693,CHARADES--,"compounded of wit, scholar, and gentleman. His world was not a very"
694,CHARADES--,"serious or a very earnest world, and he wrote of it pretty much as he"
695,CHARADES--,"found it, with some slight touches of half-sad, half-cynical, but never"
696,CHARADES--,unkindly moralising; yet with all its faults it was a pleasant world to
697,CHARADES--,"those whom it treated well, and a man laden with society’s favours, as"
698,CHARADES--,"was Praed, was not likely to develop into a Democritus. Few poets have"
699,CHARADES--,been better treated by the world than he was: the paths of literature
700,CHARADES--,and politics were never thorny ones to him; his talents brought him
701,CHARADES--,reputation before he had ever struggled to attain it. Helping hands were
702,CHARADES--,freely held out to him from the hour of his first schoolboy success; he
703,CHARADES--,"was popular in society, fortunate in friendship, and, above all things,"
704,CHARADES--,happy in his family and domestic affections. Mr. Locker remarks of the
705,CHARADES--,"qualities of his poetry, that “his fancy is less wild than Moore’s,"
706,CHARADES--,while his sympathies are narrower than Thackeray’s.” Both statements
707,CHARADES--,(qualified by the further expression of opinion that has already been
708,CHARADES--,quoted) may be accepted without much demur. With regard to the latter
709,CHARADES--,"remark, there are indeed few writers of the century of whom it might"
710,CHARADES--,"not, with equal justice, have been made. Admitting that his sympathies"
711,CHARADES--,"were neither very deep nor very wide, they are at least essentially and"
712,CHARADES--,"uniformly healthy and pure. Whatever might have been Praed’s matter, his"
713,CHARADES--,"manner, although not versatile, is always good. His fluency of"
714,CHARADES--,"expression is remarkable, and must have even been a source of weakness,"
715,CHARADES--,"since a man who wrote so much, so constantly, and with so little effort,"
716,CHARADES--,must almost inevitably have perpetrated a good deal of inferior work in
717,CHARADES--,"his time. What Praed published formed only a portion of what he wrote,"
718,CHARADES--,for he was always ready to scribble verse on slight temptation; and that
719,CHARADES--,"“inquisitive man with the note book,” Nathaniel Parker Willis, who met"
720,CHARADES--,"Praed at a country house, has left it on record that he was ever open to"
721,CHARADES--,furnish contributions to the inevitable album that every fair one
722,CHARADES--,"cherished in those days. Praed’s style, as has been said, is not"
723,CHARADES--,versatile: he never hazarded possible harshness by metrical
724,CHARADES--,"experiments, and the measures that he particularly affected have become"
725,CHARADES--,intimately associated with the general characteristics of his style; his
726,CHARADES--,"rhyme and rhythm are both perfect, and apparently instinctive, as if"
727,CHARADES--,writing in metre were as effortless an exercise to him as writing in
728,CHARADES--,prose.
729,CHARADES--,
730,CHARADES--,"To conclude in the words of the Rev. Derwent Coleridge, “Not unknown,"
731,CHARADES--,"nor without mark in the arena of political conflict, the name of Praed"
732,CHARADES--,is still remembered as at least that of a forward pupil in the school of
733,CHARADES--,"statesmanship; and though his literary honours, won in earliest manhood,"
734,CHARADES--,"and sustained by the casual productions of a leisure hour, were worn"
735,CHARADES--,"carelessly, while he was preparing for more serious duties, yet now that"
736,CHARADES--,"years have gone by, and we have to audit the past with no expectation of"
737,CHARADES--,"any future account, we find that he has left behind him a permanent"
738,CHARADES--,"expression of wit and grace, refined and tender feeling, of inventive"
739,CHARADES--,"fancy and acute observation, unique in character, and his own by an"
740,CHARADES--,undisputed title.”

804,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","And rocks, whose very crags seem bowers,"
805,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",So gay they are with grass and flowers!
806,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",But the Abbot was thinking of scenery
807,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","About as much, in sooth,"
808,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","As a lover thinks of constancy,"
809,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",Or an advocate of truth.
810,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",He did not mark how the skies in wrath

813,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",Grew damp beneath his tread;
814,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","And nearer he came, and still more near,"
815,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","To a pool, in whose recess"
816,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","The water had slept for many a year,"
817,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",Unchanged and motionless;
818,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",From the river stream it spread away
819,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",The space of half a rood;
820,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",The surface had the hue of clay
821,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And the scent of human blood;
822,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",The trees and the herbs that round it grew
823,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","Were venomous and foul,"
824,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And the birds that through the bushes flew
825,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",Were the vulture and the owl;
826,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",The water was as dark and rank
827,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","As ever a company pumped,"
828,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","And the perch, that was netted and laid on the bank,"
829,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",Grew rotten while it jumped;
830,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And bold was the man who thither came
831,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","At midnight, man or boy,"
832,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","For the place was cursed with an evil name,"

834,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",
835,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","The Abbot was weary as abbot could be,"
836,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And he sat down to rest on the stump of a tree:
837,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",When suddenly rose a dismal tone--
838,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","Was it a song, or was it a moan?"
839,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",“O ho! O ho!
840,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",Above--below--
841,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",Lightly and brightly they glide and go!
842,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","The hungry and keen on the top are leaping,"
843,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",The lazy and fat in the depths are sleeping;
844,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","Fishing is fine when the pool is muddy,"
845,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",Broiling is rich when the coals are ruddy.”
846,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","In a monstrous fright, by the murky light,"
847,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","He looked to the left and he looked to the right,"
848,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","And what was the vision close before him,"
849,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",That flung such a sudden stupor o’er him?
850,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","’Twas a sight to make the hair uprise,"
851,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And the life blood colder run:
852,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","The startled priest struck both his thighs,"
853,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And the abbey clock struck one!
854,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","All alone, by the side of the pool,"
855,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","A tall man sat on a three-legged stool,"
856,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","Kicking his heels on the dewy sod,"
857,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And putting in order his reel and rod;
858,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","Red were the rags his shoulders wore,"
859,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And a high red cap on his head he bore;
860,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",His arms and his legs were long and bare;
861,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And two or three locks of long red hair

882,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",And its shape was the shape of a diadem.
883,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",It was fastened a gleaming hook about
884,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.",By a chain within and a chain without;
885,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","The fisherman gave it a kick and a spin,"

919,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","Sprightly story, wicked jest,"
920,"THE RED FISHERMAN; OR, THE DEVIL’S DECOY.","Rated servant, greeted guest,"

2114,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,They’re sure you’ll find it vastly lonely:
2115,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"You go to Cheltenham for the waters,"
2116,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And meet the Countess and her daughters;
2117,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,You take a cottage at Geneva--
2118,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Lo! Lady Anne and Lady Eva.
2119,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"In horror of another session,"
2120,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"You just surrender at discretion,"
2121,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And live to curse the frauds of mothers,"
2122,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And envy all your younger brothers.
2123,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2124,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Count Otto bowed, Count Otto smiled,"
2125,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,When my Lady praised her darling child;
2126,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Count Otto smiled, Count Otto bowed,"
2127,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,When the child those praises disavowed;
2128,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"As a knight should gaze, Count Otto gazed,"
2129,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Where Bertha in all her beauty blazed;
2130,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"As a knight should hear, Count Otto heard,"
2131,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,When Liba sang like a forest bird;
2132,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"But he thought, I trow, about as long"
2133,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Of Bertha’s beauty and Liba’s song,"
2134,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As the sun may think of the clouds that play
2135,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,O’er his radiant path on a summer day.
2136,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Many a maid had dreams of state,"
2137,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As the Count rode up to her father’s gate;
2138,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Many a maid shed tears of pain,"
2139,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As the Count rode back to his tower again;
2140,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"But little he cared, as it should seem,"
2141,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"For the sad, sad tear, or the fond, fond dream;"
2142,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Alone he lived--alone and free
2143,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As the owl that dwells in the hollow tree;
2144,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And the Baroness said and the Baron swore,"
2145,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,That never was knight so shy before.
2146,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2147,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,It was almost the first of May:
2148,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The sun, all smiles, had passed away;"
2149,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The moon was beautifully bright;
2150,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Earth, heaven, as usual in such cases,"
2151,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Looked up and down with happy faces;--
2152,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,In short it was a charming night.
2153,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2154,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And all alone, at twelve o’clock,"
2155,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The young Count clambered down the rock,"
2156,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Unfurled the sail, unchained the oar,"
2157,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And pushed the shallop from the shore.
2158,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The holiness that sweet time flings
2159,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Upon all human thoughts and things,"
2160,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"When Sorrow checks her idle sighs,"
2161,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And Care shuts fast her wearied eyes,--"
2162,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The splendour of the hues that played
2163,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Fantastical o’er hill and glade,"
2164,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As verdant slopes and barren cliff
2165,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Seemed darting by the tiny skiff,--"
2166,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The flowers, whose faint tips, here and there,"
2167,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Breathed out such fragrance, you might swear"
2168,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,That every soundless gale that fanned
2169,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The tide came fresh from fairy-land,--"
2170,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The music of the mountain rill,"
2171,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Leaping in glee from hill to hill,"
2172,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To which some wild bird, now and then,"
2173,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Made answer from her darksome glen,--"
2174,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,All this to him had rarer pleasure
2175,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Than jester’s wit or minstrel’s measure;
2176,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And, if you ever loved romancing,"
2177,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Or felt extremely tired of dancing,"
2178,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,You’ll hardly wonder that Count Otto
2179,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Left Lady Hildegonde’s ridotto.
2180,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2181,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,What melody glides o’er the starlit stream?
2182,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,“Lurley!--Lurley!”
2183,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Angels of grace! does the young Count dream?
2184,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,“Lurley!--Lurley!”
2185,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Or is the scene indeed so fair
2186,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,That a nymph of the sea or a nymph of the air
2187,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Has left the home of her own delight,"
2188,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,To sing to our roses and rocks to-night?
2189,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,“Lurley!--Lurley!”
2190,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Words there are none; but the waves prolong
2191,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The notes of that mysterious song:
2192,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"He listens, he listens; and all around"
2193,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Ripples the echo of that sweet sound,"
2194,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,“Lurley!--Lurley!”
2195,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,No form appears on the river side;
2196,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,No boat is borne on the wandering tide;
2197,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And the tones ring on, with nought to show"
2198,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Or whence they come or whither they go;
2199,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,“Lurley!--Lurley!”
2200,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"As fades one murmur on the ear,"
2201,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"There comes another, just as clear;"
2202,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And the present is like to the parted strain,"
2203,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As link to link of a golden chain:
2204,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,“Lurley!--Lurley!”
2205,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Whether the voice be sad or gay,"
2206,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,’Twere very hard for the Count to say;
2207,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"But pale are his cheeks, and pained his brow,"
2208,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And the boat drifts on, he recks not how;"
2209,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"His pulse is quick, and his heart is wild,"
2210,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And he weeps, he weeps, like a little child."
2211,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2212,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,O mighty music! they who know
2213,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The witchery of thy wondrous bow,"
2214,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Forget, when thy strange spells have bound them,"
2215,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The visible world that lies around them.
2216,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"When Lady Mary sings Rossini,"
2217,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Or stares at spectral Paganini,"
2218,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,To Lady Mary does it matter
2219,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Who laugh, who love, who fawn, who flatter?"
2220,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Oh no! she cannot heed or hear
2221,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Reason or rhyme from prince or peer:
2222,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,In vain for her Sir Charles denounces
2223,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The horror of the last new flounces;
2224,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,In vain the Doctor does his duty
2225,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,By doubting of her rival’s beauty;
2226,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And if my Lord as usual raves
2227,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,About the sugar or the slaves;
2228,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Predicts the nation’s future glories,"
2229,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And chants the requiem of the Tories,"
2230,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Good man,--she minds him just as much"
2231,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As Marshal Gerard minds the Dutch.
2232,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2233,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Hid was the bright heaven’s loveliness
2234,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Beneath a sudden cloud,"
2235,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As a bride might doff her bridal dress
2236,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,To don her funeral shroud;
2237,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And over flood and over fell,"
2238,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"With a wild and wicked shout,"
2239,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"From the secret cell where in chains they dwell,"
2240,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The joyous winds rushed out;
2241,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And, the tall hills through, the thunder flew,"
2242,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And down the fierce hail came;
2243,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And from peak to peak the lightning threw
2244,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Its shafts of liquid flame.
2245,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The boat went down; without delay,"
2246,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The luckless boatman swooned away;
2247,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And when, as a clear spring morning rose,"
2248,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"He woke in wonder from repose,"
2249,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The river was calm as the river could be,"
2250,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And the thrush was awake on the gladsome tree,"
2251,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And there he lay, in a sunny cave,"
2252,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"On the margin of the tranquil wave,"
2253,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Half deaf with that infernal din,"
2254,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And wet, poor fellow, to the skin."
2255,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2256,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"He looked to the left, and he looked to the right:"
2257,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Why hastened he not, the noble Knight,"
2258,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To dry his aged nurse’s tears,"
2259,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To calm his hoary butler’s fears,"
2260,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,To listen to the prudent speeches
2261,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Of half-a-dozen loquacious leeches,"
2262,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To swallow cordials circumspectly,"
2263,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And change his dripping cloak directly?
2264,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"With foot out-stretched, with hand up-raised,"
2265,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,In vast surprise he gazed and gazed.
2266,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Within a deep and damp recess
2267,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,A maiden lay in her loveliness.
2268,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Lived she?--in sooth, ’twere hard to tell,"
2269,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Sleep counterfeited Death so well.
2270,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,A shelf of the rock was all her bed;
2271,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,A ceiling of crystal was o’er her head;
2272,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Silken veil, nor satin vest,"
2273,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Shrouded her form in its silent rest;
2274,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Only her long, long golden hair"
2275,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,About her lay like a thin robe there.
2276,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Up to her couch the young knight crept:
2277,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,How very sound the maiden slept!
2278,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Fearful and faint the young knight sighed:
2279,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The echoes of the cave replied.
2280,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,He leaned to look upon her face;
2281,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,He clasped her hand in a wild embrace;
2282,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Never was form of such fine mould;
2283,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,But the hands and the face were as white and cold
2284,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As they of the Parian stone were made
2285,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To which, in great Minerva’s shade,"
2286,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The Athenian sculptor’s toilsome knife
2287,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Gave all of loveliness but life.
2288,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,On her fair neck there seemed no stain
2289,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Where the pure blood coursed through the delicate vein;
2290,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And her breath, if breath indeed it were,"
2291,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Flowed in a current so soft and rare,"
2292,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,It would scarcely have stirred the young moth’s wing
2293,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,On the path of his noonday wandering--Never
2294,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,on earth a creature trod
2295,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Half so lovely, or half so odd."
2296,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2297,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Count Otto stares till his eyelids ache,"
2298,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And wonders when she’ll please to wake;
2299,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"While fancy whispers strange suggestions,"
2300,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And wonder prompts a score of questions.
2301,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Is she a nymph of another sphere?
2302,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,How came she hither? What doth she here?
2303,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Or if the morning of her birth
2304,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Be registered on this our earth,"
2305,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Why hath she fled from her father’s halls?
2306,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And where hath she left her cloaks and shawls?
2307,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"There was no time for reason’s lectures,"
2308,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,There was no time for wit’s conjectures;
2309,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,He threw his arm with timid haste
2310,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Around the maiden’s slender waist,"
2311,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And raised her up, in a modest way,"
2312,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,From the cold bare rock on which she lay:
2313,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"He was but a mile from his castle gate,"
2314,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And the lady was scarcely five stone weight;
2315,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"He stopped in less than half-an-hour,"
2316,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"With his beauteous burden, at Belmont Tower."
2317,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2318,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Gay, I ween, was the chamber drest,"
2319,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As the Count gave order for his guest;
2320,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"But scarcely on the couch, ’tis said,"
2321,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"That gentle guest was fairly laid,"
2322,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"When she opened at once her great blue eyes,"
2323,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And, after a glance of brief surprise,"
2324,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Ere she had spoken, and ere she had heard"
2325,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Of wisdom or wit a single word,"
2326,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"She laughed so long, and laughed so loud,"
2327,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,That Dame Ulrica often vowed
2328,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,A dirge is a merrier thing by half
2329,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Than such a senseless, soulless laugh."
2330,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Around the tower the elfin crew
2331,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Seemed shouting in mirthful concert too;
2332,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And echoed roof, and trembled rafter,"
2333,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,With that unsentimental laughter.
2334,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As soon as that droll tumult passed
2335,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The maiden’s tongue, unchained at last,"
2336,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Asserted all its female right.
2337,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And talked and talked with all its might.
2338,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Oh, how her low and liquid voice"
2339,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Made the rapt hearer’s soul rejoice!
2340,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,’Twas full of those clear tones that start
2341,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"From innocent childhood’s happy heart,"
2342,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Ere passion and sin disturb the well
2343,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,In which their mirth and music dwell.
2344,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,But man nor master could make out
2345,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,What the eloquent maiden talked about;
2346,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The things she uttered like did seem
2347,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,To the bubbling waves of a limpid stream;
2348,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"For the words of her speech, if words they might be,"
2349,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Were the words of the speech of a far countrie;
2350,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And when she had said them o’er and o’er,"
2351,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Count Otto understood no more
2352,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Than you or I of the slang that falls
2353,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"From the dukes and dupes at Tattersall’s,"
2354,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Of Hebrew from a bearded Jew,"
2355,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Of metaphysics from a Blue.
2356,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2357,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Count Otto swore,--Count Otto’s reading"
2358,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Might well have taught his better breeding,--"
2359,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"That, whether the maiden should fume or fret,"
2360,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The maiden should not leave him yet;
2361,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And so he took prodigious pains
2362,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,To make her happy in her chains.
2363,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"From Paris came a pair of cooks,"
2364,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"From Göttingen a load of books,"
2365,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"From Venice stores of gorgeous suits,"
2366,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,From Florence minstrels and their lutes:
2367,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The youth himself had special pride
2368,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,In breaking horses for his bride;
2369,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And his old tutor, Dr. Hermann,"
2370,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Was brought from Bonn to teach her German.
2371,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2372,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And there in her beauty and her grace
2373,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The wayward maiden grew;
2374,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And every day of her form and face
2375,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Some charm seemed fresh and new.
2376,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Over her cold and colourless cheek
2377,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The blush of the rose was shed,"
2378,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And her quickened pulse began to speak
2379,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Of human hope and dread;
2380,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And soon she grasped the learned lore
2381,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The grey old pedant taught,"
2382,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And turned from the volume to explore
2383,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The hidden mine of thought.
2384,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Alas! her bliss was not the same
2385,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"As it was in other years,"
2386,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"For with new knowledge sorrow came,"
2387,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And with new passion tears.
2388,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Oft, till the Count came up from wine,"
2389,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"She would sit by the lattice high,"
2390,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And watch the windings of the Rhine
2391,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,With a very wistful eye;
2392,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And oft on some rude cliff she stood,"
2393,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Her light harp in her hand,"
2394,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And still, as she looked on the gurgling flood,"
2395,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,She sang of her native land.
2396,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2397,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And when Count Otto pleaded well
2398,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"For priest, and ring, and vow,"
2399,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"She heard the knight that fond tale tell,"
2400,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,With a pale and pensive brow:
2401,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"“Henceforth my spirit may not sleep,"
2402,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As ever till now it has slept;
2403,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Henceforth mine eyes have learned to weep,"
2404,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As never till now they wept.
2405,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Twelve months, dear Otto, let me grieve"
2406,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"For my own, my childhood’s home,"
2407,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Where the sun at noon, or the frost at eve,"
2408,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Did never dare to come;
2409,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And when the spring its smiles recalls,"
2410,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Thy maiden will resign
2411,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The holy hush of her father’s halls
2412,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,For the stormy joys of thine.”
2413,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"But where that father’s halls?--vain, vain;"
2414,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,She threw her sad eyes down;
2415,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And if you dared to ask again,"
2416,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,She answered with a frown.
2417,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Some people have a knack, we know"
2418,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Of saying things _mal à propos_,"
2419,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And making all the world reflect
2420,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,On what it hates to recollect.
2421,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"They talk to misers of their heir,"
2422,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To women of the times that were,"
2423,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To ruined gamblers of the box,"
2424,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To thin defaulters of the stocks,"
2425,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,To cowards of their neighbours’ duels;
2426,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To Hayne of Lady H.’s jewels,"
2427,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"To poets of the wrong Review,"
2428,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And to the French of Waterloo.
2429,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,The Count was not of these; he never
2430,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Was half so clumsy, half so clever;"
2431,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And when he found the girl had rather
2432,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Say nothing more about her father,"
2433,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,He changed the subject--told a fable--
2434,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Believed that dinner was on table--
2435,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Or whispered, with an air of sorrow,"
2436,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,That it would surely rain to-morrow.
2437,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2438,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"The winter storms went darkly by,"
2439,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And, from a blue and cloudless sky,"
2440,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Again the sun looked cheerfully
2441,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Upon the rolling Rhine;
2442,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And spring brought back to the budding flowers
2443,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Its genial light and freshening showers,"
2444,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"And music to the shady bowers,"
2445,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And verdure to the vine.
2446,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And now it is the first of May;
2447,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,For twenty miles round all is gay:
2448,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Cottage and Castle keep holiday;
2449,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,For how should sorrow lower
2450,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"On brow of rustic or of knight,"
2451,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"When heaven itself looks all so bright,"
2452,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Where Otto’s wedding feast is dight
2453,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,In the hall of Belmont Tower?
2454,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,
2455,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Stately matron and warrior tall
2456,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,Come to the joyous festival;
2457,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"Good Count Otto welcomes all,"
2458,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,As through the gate they throng;
2459,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,He fills to the brim the wassail cup:
2460,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,"In the bright wine pleasure sparkles up,"
2461,A LEGEND OF THE RHINE.,And draughts and tales grow long;

3792,SURLY HALL.,And how some faces grew in length;
3793,SURLY HALL.,And how some people--if they’d show--
3794,SURLY HALL.,Know something more than others know.
3795,SURLY HALL.,Such is his talk; and while we wonder
3796,SURLY HALL.,"At that interminable thunder,"
3797,SURLY HALL.,The undiscriminating snarler
3798,SURLY HALL.,"Astounds the ladies in the parlour,"
3799,SURLY HALL.,And broaches at his mother’s table
3800,SURLY HALL.,The slang of kennel and of stable.
3801,SURLY HALL.,"And when he’s drunk, he roars before ye"
3802,SURLY HALL.,"One excellent unfailing story,"
3803,SURLY HALL.,"About a gun, Lord knows how long,"
3804,SURLY HALL.,"With a discharge, Lord knows how strong,"
3805,SURLY HALL.,Which always needs an oath and frown
3806,SURLY HALL.,To make the monstrous dose go down.
3807,SURLY HALL.,O! oft and oft the Muses pray
3808,SURLY HALL.,"That wondrous tube may burst some day,"
3809,SURLY HALL.,And then the world will ascertain
3810,SURLY HALL.,Whether its master hath a brain!
3811,SURLY HALL.,"Then, on the stone that hides his sleep,"
3812,SURLY HALL.,"These accents shall be graven deep,--"
3813,SURLY HALL.,Or “Upton” and “C. B.”[4] between
3814,SURLY HALL.,Shine in the _Sporting Magazine_;--
3815,SURLY HALL.,"“Civil to none, except his brutes;"
3816,SURLY HALL.,"Polished in nought, except his boots;"
3817,SURLY HALL.,Here lie the relics of Joe Tarrell:
3818,SURLY HALL.,"Also, Joe Tarrell’s double-barrel!”"
3819,SURLY HALL.,Ho!--by the muttered sounds that slip
3820,SURLY HALL.,Unwilling from his curling lip;
3821,SURLY HALL.,"By the grey glimmer of his eye,"
3822,SURLY HALL.,That shines so unrelentingly;
3823,SURLY HALL.,"By the stern sneer upon his snout,"
3824,SURLY HALL.,"I know the critic, Andrew Crout!"
3825,SURLY HALL.,The boy-reviler! amply filled
3826,SURLY HALL.,"With venomed virulence, and skilled"
3827,SURLY HALL.,To look on what is good and fair
3828,SURLY HALL.,And find or make a blemish there.
3829,SURLY HALL.,For Fortune to his cradle sent
3830,SURLY HALL.,"Self-satisfying discontent,"
3831,SURLY HALL.,And he hath caught from cold Reviews
3832,SURLY HALL.,"The one great talent, to abuse;"
3833,SURLY HALL.,"And so he sallies sternly forth,"
3834,SURLY HALL.,"Like the cold Genius of the North,"
3835,SURLY HALL.,"To check the heart’s exuberant fulness,"
3836,SURLY HALL.,And chill good-humour into dulness:
3837,SURLY HALL.,"Where’er he comes, his fellows shrink"
3838,SURLY HALL.,Before his awful nod and wink;
3839,SURLY HALL.,And wheresoe’er these features plastic
3840,SURLY HALL.,"Assume the savage or sarcastic,"
3841,SURLY HALL.,"Mirth stands abashed, and Laughter flies,"
3842,SURLY HALL.,"And Humour faints, and Quibble dies."
3843,SURLY HALL.,How sour he seems!--and hark! he spoke;
3844,SURLY HALL.,We’ll stop and listen to the croak;
3845,SURLY HALL.,"’Twill charm us, if these happy lays"
3846,SURLY HALL.,Are honoured by a fool’s dispraise!--
3847,SURLY HALL.,“You think the boats well manned this year!
3848,SURLY HALL.,To you they may perhaps appear!--
3849,SURLY HALL.,"I who have seen those frames of steel,"
3850,SURLY HALL.,"Tuckfield, and Dixon, and Bulteel,"
3851,SURLY HALL.,Can swear--no matter what I swear--
3852,SURLY HALL.,Only things are not as they were!
3853,SURLY HALL.,And then our cricket!--think of that!
3854,SURLY HALL.,We ha’n’t a tolerable bat;
3855,SURLY HALL.,"It’s very true, that Mr. Tucker,"
3856,SURLY HALL.,"Who puts the field in such a pucker,"
3857,SURLY HALL.,Contrives to make his fifty runs;--
3858,SURLY HALL.,What then?--we had a Hardinge once!
3859,SURLY HALL.,"As for our talents, where are they?"
3860,SURLY HALL.,Griffin and Grildrig had their day;
3861,SURLY HALL.,And who’s the star of modern time?
3862,SURLY HALL.,Octosyllabic Peregrine;
3863,SURLY HALL.,"Who pirates, puns, and talks sedition,"
3864,SURLY HALL.,Without a moment’s intermission;
3865,SURLY HALL.,And if he did not get a lift
3866,SURLY HALL.,"Sometimes from _me_--and Doctor Swift,"
3867,SURLY HALL.,I can’t tell what the deuce he’d do!--
3868,SURLY HALL.,"But this, you know, is _entre nous_!"
3869,SURLY HALL.,"I’ve tried to talk him into taste,"
3870,SURLY HALL.,But found my labour quite misplaced;
3871,SURLY HALL.,"He nibs his pen, and twists his ear,"
3872,SURLY HALL.,And says he’s deaf and cannot hear;
3873,SURLY HALL.,"And if I mention right or rule,--"
3874,SURLY HALL.,Egad! he takes me for a fool!”
3875,SURLY HALL.,
3876,SURLY HALL.,Gazing upon this varied scene
3877,SURLY HALL.,"With a new artist’s absent mien,"
3878,SURLY HALL.,"I see thee silent and alone,"
3879,SURLY HALL.,"My friend, ingenious Hamilton."
3880,SURLY HALL.,"I see thee there--(nay, do not blush!)"
3881,SURLY HALL.,"Knight of the Pallet and the Brush,"
3882,SURLY HALL.,"Dreaming of straight and crooked lines,"
3883,SURLY HALL.,And planning portraits and designs.
3884,SURLY HALL.,"I like him hugely!--well I wis,"
3885,SURLY HALL.,"No despicable skill is his,"
3886,SURLY HALL.,Whether his sportive canvas shows
3887,SURLY HALL.,"Arabia’s sands or Zembla’s snows,"
3888,SURLY HALL.,"A lion, or a bed of lilies,"
3889,SURLY HALL.,"Fair Caroline, or fierce Achilles;"
3890,SURLY HALL.,I love to see him taking down
3891,SURLY HALL.,"A schoolfellow’s unconscious frown,"
3892,SURLY HALL.,"Describing twist, grimace, contortion,"
3893,SURLY HALL.,"In most becoming disproportion,"
3894,SURLY HALL.,While o’er his merry paper glide
3895,SURLY HALL.,Rivers of wit; and by his side
3896,SURLY HALL.,"Caricatura takes her stand,"
3897,SURLY HALL.,Inspires the thought and guides the hand;
3898,SURLY HALL.,I love to see his honoured books
3899,SURLY HALL.,Adorned with rivulets and brooks;
3900,SURLY HALL.,"Troy frowning with her ancient towers,"
3901,SURLY HALL.,Or Ida gay with fruit and flowers;
3902,SURLY HALL.,"I love to see fantastic shapes,"
3903,SURLY HALL.,"Dragons and griffins, birds and apes,"
3904,SURLY HALL.,"And pigmy forms and forms gigantic,"
3905,SURLY HALL.,"Forms natural, and forms romantic,"
3906,SURLY HALL.,"Of dwarf and ogres, dames and knights,"
3907,SURLY HALL.,"Scrawled by the side of Homer’s fights,"
3908,SURLY HALL.,"And portraits daubed on Maro’s poems,"
3909,SURLY HALL.,And profiles penned to Tulley’s Proems;
3910,SURLY HALL.,"In short, I view with partial eyes"
3911,SURLY HALL.,Whate’er my brother painter tries.
3912,SURLY HALL.,To each belongs his own utensil;
3913,SURLY HALL.,"I sketch with pen, as he with pencil;"
3914,SURLY HALL.,"And each, with pencil or with pen,"
3915,SURLY HALL.,Hits off a likeness now and then.
3916,SURLY HALL.,He drew _me_ once--the spiteful creature!
3917,SURLY HALL.,’Twas voted--“like in every feature;”
3918,SURLY HALL.,"It might have been so!--(’twas lopsided,"
3919,SURLY HALL.,And squinted worse than ever I did:)
3920,SURLY HALL.,"However, from that hapless day,"
3921,SURLY HALL.,"I owed the debt, which here I pay;"
3922,SURLY HALL.,And now I’ll give my friend a hint:--
3923,SURLY HALL.,"Unless you want to shine in print,"
3924,SURLY HALL.,"Paint lords and ladies, nymphs and fairies,"
3925,SURLY HALL.,"And demi-gods, and dromedaries;"
3926,SURLY HALL.,"But never be an author’s creditor,"
3927,SURLY HALL.,Nor paint the picture of an Editor!
3928,SURLY HALL.,
3929,SURLY HALL.,"Who is the youth with stare confounded,"
3930,SURLY HALL.,"And tender arms so neatly rounded,"
3931,SURLY HALL.,"And moveless eyes, and glowing face,"
3932,SURLY HALL.,And attitude of studied grace?
3933,SURLY HALL.,"Now Venus, pour your lustre o’er us!"
3934,SURLY HALL.,Your would-be servant stands before us!
3935,SURLY HALL.,"Hail, Corydon! let others blame"
3936,SURLY HALL.,The fury of his fictioned flame;
3937,SURLY HALL.,I love to hear the beardless youth
3938,SURLY HALL.,"Talking of constancy and truth,"
3939,SURLY HALL.,Swearing more darts are in his liver
3940,SURLY HALL.,"Than ever gleamed in Cupid’s quiver,"
3941,SURLY HALL.,And wondering at those hearts of stone
3942,SURLY HALL.,Which never melted like his own.
3943,SURLY HALL.,"Ah! when I look on Fashion’s moth,"
3944,SURLY HALL.,"Wrapt in his visions and his cloth,"
3945,SURLY HALL.,"I would not, for a nation’s gold,"
3946,SURLY HALL.,Disturb the dream--or spoil the fold!
3947,SURLY HALL.,
3948,SURLY HALL.,"And who the maid, whose gilded chain,"
3949,SURLY HALL.,Hath bound the heart of such a swain?
3950,SURLY HALL.,Oh! look on those surrounding graces!
3951,SURLY HALL.,There is no lack of pretty faces;
3952,SURLY HALL.,"M----l, the goddess of the night,"
3953,SURLY HALL.,Looks beautiful with all her might;
3954,SURLY HALL.,"And M----, in that simple dress,"
3955,SURLY HALL.,Enthralls us more by studying less;
3956,SURLY HALL.,"D----, in your becoming pride,"
3957,SURLY HALL.,"Ye march to conquest, side by side;"
3958,SURLY HALL.,"And A----, thou fleetest by"
3959,SURLY HALL.,Bright in thine arch simplicity;
3960,SURLY HALL.,Slight are the links thy power hath wreathed;
3961,SURLY HALL.,"Yet, by the tone thy voice hath breathed,"
3962,SURLY HALL.,"By thy glad smile and ringlets curled,"
3963,SURLY HALL.,I would not break them for the world!
3964,SURLY HALL.,But this is idle! Paying court
3965,SURLY HALL.,I know was never yet my forte;
3966,SURLY HALL.,"And all I say of nymph and queen,"
3967,SURLY HALL.,"To cut it short, can only mean"
3968,SURLY HALL.,That when I throw my gaze around
3969,SURLY HALL.,I see much beauty on the ground.
3970,SURLY HALL.,
3971,SURLY HALL.,Hark! hark! a mellowed note
3972,SURLY HALL.,Over the water seemed to float!
3973,SURLY HALL.,Hark! the note repeated!
3974,SURLY HALL.,"A sweet, and soft, and soothing strain"
3975,SURLY HALL.,"Echoed, and died, and rose again,"
3976,SURLY HALL.,As if the Nymphs of Fairy reign
3977,SURLY HALL.,"Were holding to-night their revel rout,"
3978,SURLY HALL.,"And pouring their fragrant voices out,"
3979,SURLY HALL.,On the blue water seated.
3980,SURLY HALL.,"Hark to the tremulous tones that flow,"
3981,SURLY HALL.,"And the voice of the boatmen as they row,"
3982,SURLY HALL.,"Cheerfully to the heart they go,"
3983,SURLY HALL.,And touch a thousand pleasant strings
3984,SURLY HALL.,"Of triumph and pride, and hope and joy,"
3985,SURLY HALL.,"And thoughts that are only known to boy,"
3986,SURLY HALL.,And young imaginings!
3987,SURLY HALL.,"The note is near, the voice comes clear,"
3988,SURLY HALL.,And we catch its echo on the ear
3989,SURLY HALL.,With a feeling of delight;
3990,SURLY HALL.,"And, as the gladdening sounds we hear,"
3991,SURLY HALL.,"There’s many an eager listener here,"
3992,SURLY HALL.,And many a straining sight.
3993,SURLY HALL.,
3994,SURLY HALL.,"One moment,--and ye see"
3995,SURLY HALL.,"Where, fluttering quick, as the breezes blow,"
3996,SURLY HALL.,"Backwards and forwards, to and fro,"
3997,SURLY HALL.,"Bright with the beam of retiring day,"
3998,SURLY HALL.,"Old Eton’s flag, on its watery way,"
3999,SURLY HALL.,Moves on triumphantly!
4000,SURLY HALL.,But what that ancient poets have told
4001,SURLY HALL.,"Of Amphitrite’s car of gold,"
4002,SURLY HALL.,"With the Nymphs behind, and the Nymphs before,"
4003,SURLY HALL.,"And the Nereid’s song, and the Triton’s roar,"
4004,SURLY HALL.,Could equal half the pride
4005,SURLY HALL.,That heralds the Monarch’s plashing oar
4006,SURLY HALL.,Over the swelling tide?
4007,SURLY HALL.,"And look!--they land those gallant crews,"
4008,SURLY HALL.,"With their jackets light, and their bellying trews;"
4009,SURLY HALL.,"And Ashley walks applauded by,"
4010,SURLY HALL.,With a world’s talent in his eye;
4011,SURLY HALL.,"And Kinglake, dear to poetry,"
4012,SURLY HALL.,And dearer to his friends;
4013,SURLY HALL.,"Hibernian Roberts, you are there,"
4014,SURLY HALL.,"With that unthinking, merry stare"
4015,SURLY HALL.,Which still its influence lends
4016,SURLY HALL.,"To make us drown our devils blue,"
4017,SURLY HALL.,"In laughing at ourselves,--and you!"
4018,SURLY HALL.,"Still I could lengthen out the tale,"
4019,SURLY HALL.,And sing Sir Thomas with his ale
4020,SURLY HALL.,To all that like to read;
4021,SURLY HALL.,Still I could choose to linger long
4022,SURLY HALL.,Where Friendship bids the willing song
4023,SURLY HALL.,Flow out for honest Meade!
4024,SURLY HALL.,
4025,SURLY HALL.,Yet e’en on this triumphant day
4026,SURLY HALL.,One thought of grief will rise;
4027,SURLY HALL.,"And though I bid my fancy play,"
4028,SURLY HALL.,"And jest and laugh through all the lay,"
4029,SURLY HALL.,"Yet sadness still will have its way,"
4030,SURLY HALL.,And burst the vain disguise!
4031,SURLY HALL.,"Yes! when the pageant shall have passed,"
4032,SURLY HALL.,I shall have looked upon my last;
4033,SURLY HALL.,I shall not e’er behold again
4034,SURLY HALL.,Our pullers’ unremitted strain;
4035,SURLY HALL.,Nor listen to the charming cry
4036,SURLY HALL.,Of contest or of victory
4037,SURLY HALL.,"That speaks what those young bosoms feel,"
4038,SURLY HALL.,As keel is pressing fast on keel;
4039,SURLY HALL.,"Oh! bright these glories still shall be,"
4040,SURLY HALL.,But they shall never dawn for me!
4041,SURLY HALL.,
4042,SURLY HALL.,E’en when a realm’s congratulation
4043,SURLY HALL.,"Sang Pæans for the Coronation,"
4044,SURLY HALL.,"Amidst the pleasure that was round me,"
4045,SURLY HALL.,A melancholy spirit found me;
4046,SURLY HALL.,And while all else were singing “Io!”
4047,SURLY HALL.,I couldn’t speak a word but “Heigh-ho!”
4048,SURLY HALL.,"And so, instead of laughing gaily,"
4049,SURLY HALL.,"I dropped a tear,--and wrote my “Vale.”"
4050,SURLY HALL.,
4051,VALE!,VALE!
4052,VALE!,
4053,VALE!,"Eton, the Monarch of thy prayers"
4054,VALE!,E’en now receives his load of cares;
4055,VALE!,Throned in the consecrated choir
4056,VALE!,"He takes the sceptre of his sire,"
4057,VALE!,"And wears the crown his father wore,"
4058,VALE!,"And swears the oath his father swore,"
4059,VALE!,"And therefore sounds of joy resound,"
4060,VALE!,"Fair Eton, on thy classic ground."
4061,VALE!,A gladder gale is round thee breathed;
4062,VALE!,And on thy mansions thou hast wreathed
4063,VALE!,"A thousand lamps, whose various hue"
4064,VALE!,Waits but the night to burst to view.
4065,VALE!,Woe to the poets that refuse
4066,VALE!,"To wake and woo their idle Muse,"
4067,VALE!,"When those glad notes, “God save the King,”"
4068,VALE!,"From hill, and vale, and hamlet ring!"
4069,VALE!,"Hark, how the loved inspiring tune"
4070,VALE!,Peals forth from every loyal loon
4071,VALE!,"Who loves his country, and excels"
4072,VALE!,In drinking beer or ringing bells!
4073,VALE!,It is a day of shouts and greeting;
4074,VALE!,A day of idleness and eating;
4075,VALE!,"And triumph swells in every soul,"
4076,VALE!,"And mighty beeves are roasted whole,"
4077,VALE!,"And ale, unbought, is set a-running,"
4078,VALE!,"And pleasure’s hymn grows rather stunning,"
4079,VALE!,"And children roll upon the green,"
4080,VALE!,"And cry, “Confusion to the Queen!”"
4081,VALE!,"And Sorrow flies, and Labour slumbers:"
4082,VALE!,And Clio pours her loudest numbers;
4083,VALE!,And hundreds of that joyous throng
4084,VALE!,With whom my life hath lingered long
4085,VALE!,"Give their glad raptures to the gale,"
4086,VALE!,In one united echoing “Hail!”
4087,VALE!,
4088,VALE!,"I took the harp, I smote the string,"
4089,VALE!,"I strove to soar on Fancy’s wing,"
4090,VALE!,And murmur in my sovereign’s praise
4091,VALE!,The latest of my boyhood’s lays.
4092,VALE!,Alas! the theme was too divine
4093,VALE!,To suit so weak a Muse as mine:
4094,VALE!,I saw--I felt it could not be;
4095,VALE!,No song of triumph flows from me;
4096,VALE!,The harp from which those sounds ye ask
4097,VALE!,Is all unfit for such a task;
4098,VALE!,"And the last echo of its tone,"
4099,VALE!,"Dear Eton, must be thine alone!"
4100,VALE!,
4101,VALE!,"A few short hours, and I am borne"
4102,VALE!,Far from the fetters I have worn;
4103,VALE!,"A few short hours, and I am free!--"
4104,VALE!,"And yet I shrink from liberty,"
4105,VALE!,"And look, and long to give my soul"
4106,VALE!,Back to thy cherishing control.
4107,VALE!,Control? Ah no! thy chain was meant
4108,VALE!,Far less for bond than ornament;
4109,VALE!,"And though its links are firmly set,"
4110,VALE!,I never found them gall me yet.
4111,VALE!,"Oh still, through many chequered years,"
4112,VALE!,"’Mid anxious toils, and hopes, and fears,"
4113,VALE!,"Still I have doted on thy fame,"
4114,VALE!,And only gloried in thy name.
4115,VALE!,How I have loved thee! Thou hast been
4116,VALE!,"My Hope, my Mistress, and my Queen;"
4117,VALE!,"I always found thee kind, and thou"
4118,VALE!,Hast never seen me weep--till now.
4119,VALE!,
4120,VALE!,"I knew that time was fleeting fast,"
4121,VALE!,I knew thy pleasures could not last;
4122,VALE!,I knew too well that riper age
4123,VALE!,Must step upon a busier stage;
4124,VALE!,Yet when around thine ancient towers
4125,VALE!,"I passed secure my tranquil hours,"
4126,VALE!,Or heard beneath thine aged trees
4127,VALE!,"The drowsy humming of the bees,"
4128,VALE!,"Or wandered by thy winding stream,"
4129,VALE!,I would not check my fancy’s dream;
4130,VALE!,"Glad in my transitory bliss,"
4131,VALE!,I recked not of an hour like this;
4132,VALE!,"And now the truth comes swiftly on,"
4133,VALE!,"The truth I would not think upon,"
4134,VALE!,"The last sad thought, so oft delayed,--"
4135,VALE!,“These joys are only born to fade.”
4136,VALE!,
4137,VALE!,"Ye Guardians of my earliest days,"
4138,VALE!,"Ye Patrons of my earliest lays,"
4139,VALE!,"Custom reminds me, that to you"
4140,VALE!,Thanks and farewell to-day are due.
4141,VALE!,"Thanks and farewell I give you,--not"
4142,VALE!,(As some that leave this holy spot)
4143,VALE!,In laboured phrase and polished lie
4144,VALE!,"Wrought by the forge of flattery,"
4145,VALE!,But with a heart that cannot tell
4146,VALE!,The half of what it feels so well.
4147,VALE!,"If I am backward to express,"
4148,VALE!,"Believe, my love is not the less;"
4149,VALE!,"Be kind as you are wont, and view"
4150,VALE!,A thousand thanks in one Adieu.
4151,VALE!,My future life shall strive to show
4152,VALE!,I wish to pay the debt I owe;
4153,VALE!,The labours that ye give to May
4154,VALE!,September’s fruits shall best repay.
4155,VALE!,"And you, my friends, who loved to share"
4156,VALE!,"Whate’er was mine of sport or care,"
4157,VALE!,"Antagonists at fives or chess,"
4158,VALE!,"Friends in the play-ground or the press,"
4159,VALE!,I leave ye now; and all that rests
4160,VALE!,"Of mutual tastes, and loving breasts,"
4161,VALE!,"In the lone vision that shall come,"
4162,VALE!,"Where’er my studies and my home,"
4163,VALE!,To cheer my labour and my pain
4164,VALE!,And make me feel a boy again.
4165,VALE!,
4166,VALE!,"Yes! when at last I sit me down,"
4167,VALE!,"A scholar, in my cap and gown,--"
4168,VALE!,"When learned doctrines, dark and deep,"
4169,VALE!,"Move me to passion or to sleep,--"
4170,VALE!,"When Clio yields to logic’s wrangles,"
4171,VALE!,"And Long and Short give place to angles,--"
4172,VALE!,When stern Mathesis makes it treason
4173,VALE!,"To like a rhyme, or scorn a reason--"
4174,VALE!,With aching head and weary wit
4175,VALE!,"Your parted friend shall often sit,"
4176,VALE!,"Till Fancy’s magic spell hath bound him,"
4177,VALE!,And lonely musings flit around him;
4178,VALE!,"Then shall ye come with all your wiles,"
4179,VALE!,"Of gladdening sounds and warming smiles,"
4180,VALE!,"And nought shall meet his eye or ear,--"
4181,VALE!,Yet shall he deem your souls are near.
4182,VALE!,

5366,THE CHAUNT OF THE BRAZEN HEAD.,"pronounce a prologue to those sentiments of Wisdom and Virtue,"
5367,THE CHAUNT OF THE BRAZEN HEAD.,"which are hereafter to be the oracles of statesmen, and the guides"
5368,THE CHAUNT OF THE BRAZEN HEAD.,"of philosophers. Give me to-night a proem of our essay, an opening"

5374,HEAD.,"I think, whatever mortals crave,"
5375,HEAD.,"With impotent endeavour,--"
5376,HEAD.,"A wreath, a rank, a throne, a grave,--"
5377,HEAD.,The world goes round for ever:
5378,HEAD.,I think that life is not too long;
5379,HEAD.,"And therefore I determine,"
5380,HEAD.,That many people read a song
5381,HEAD.,Who will not read a sermon.
5382,HEAD.,
5383,HEAD.,"I think you’ve looked through many hearts,"
5384,HEAD.,"And mused on many actions,"
5385,HEAD.,"And studied Man’s component parts,"
5386,HEAD.,And Nature’s compound fractions;
5387,HEAD.,I think you’ve picked up truth by bits
5388,HEAD.,From foreigner and neighbour;
5389,HEAD.,"I think the world has lost its wits,"
5390,HEAD.,And you have lost your labour.
5391,HEAD.,
5392,HEAD.,"I think the studies of the wise,"
5393,HEAD.,"The hero’s noisy quarrel,"
5394,HEAD.,"The majesty of woman’s eyes,"
5395,HEAD.,"The poet’s cherished laurel,"
5396,HEAD.,"And all that makes us lean or fat,"
5397,HEAD.,"And all that charms or troubles,--"
5398,HEAD.,"This bubble is more bright than that,"
5399,HEAD.,But still they all are bubbles.
5400,HEAD.,
5401,HEAD.,"I think the thing you call Renown,"
5402,HEAD.,The unsubstantial vapour
5403,HEAD.,"For which the soldier burns a town,"
5404,HEAD.,"The sonnetteer a taper,"
5405,HEAD.,"Is like the mist which, as he flies,"
5406,HEAD.,The horseman leaves behind him;
5407,HEAD.,"He cannot mark its wreaths arise,"
5408,HEAD.,Or if he does they blind him.
5409,HEAD.,
5410,HEAD.,I think one nod of Mistress Chance
5411,HEAD.,"Makes creditors of debtors,"
5412,HEAD.,"And shifts the funeral for the dance,"
5413,HEAD.,The sceptre for the fetters:
5414,HEAD.,I think that Fortune’s favoured guest
5415,HEAD.,"May live to gnaw the platters,"
5416,HEAD.,And he that wears the purple vest
5417,HEAD.,May wear the rags and tatters.
5418,HEAD.,
5419,HEAD.,I think the Tories love to buy
5420,HEAD.,"“Your Lordships” and “your Graces,”"
5421,HEAD.,"By loathing common honesty,"
5422,HEAD.,And lauding commonplaces:
5423,HEAD.,"I think that some are very wise,"
5424,HEAD.,"And some are very funny,"
5425,HEAD.,"And some grow rich by telling lies,"
5426,HEAD.,And some by telling money.
5427,HEAD.,
5428,HEAD.,I think the Whigs are wicked knaves--
5429,HEAD.,(And very like the Tories)--
5430,HEAD.,"Who doubt that Britain rules the waves,"
5431,HEAD.,And ask the price of glories:
5432,HEAD.,I think that many fret and fume
5433,HEAD.,"At what their friends are planning,"
5434,HEAD.,"And Mr. Hume hates Mr. Brougham,"
5435,HEAD.,As much as Mr. Canning.
5436,HEAD.,
5437,HEAD.,"I think that friars and their hoods,"
5438,HEAD.,"Their doctrines and their maggots,"
5439,HEAD.,"Have lighted up too many feuds,"
5440,HEAD.,And far too many faggots:
5441,HEAD.,"I think, while zealots fast and frown,"
5442,HEAD.,"And fight for two or seven,"
5443,HEAD.,"That there are fifty roads to Town,"
5444,HEAD.,And rather more to Heaven.
5445,HEAD.,
5446,HEAD.,"I think that, thanks to Paget’s lance,"
5447,HEAD.,"And thanks to Chester’s learning,"
5448,HEAD.,The hearts that burned for fame in France
5449,HEAD.,At home are safe from burning:
5450,HEAD.,I think the Pope is on his back;
5451,HEAD.,"And, though ’tis fun to shake him,"
5452,HEAD.,I think the Devil not so black
5453,HEAD.,As many people make him.
5454,HEAD.,
5455,HEAD.,"I think that Love is like a play,"
5456,HEAD.,"Where tears and smiles are blended,"
5457,HEAD.,"Or like a faithless April day,"
5458,HEAD.,Whose shine with shower is ended:
5459,HEAD.,"Like Colnbrook pavement, rather rough,"
5460,HEAD.,"Like trade, exposed to losses,"
5461,HEAD.,"And like a Highland plaid,--all stuff,"
5462,HEAD.,And very full of crosses.
5463,HEAD.,
5464,HEAD.,"I think the world, though dark it be,"
5465,HEAD.,Has aye one rapturous pleasure
5466,HEAD.,"Concealed in life’s monotony,"
5467,HEAD.,For those who seek the treasure:
5468,HEAD.,"One planet in a starless night,"
5469,HEAD.,"One blossom on a briar,"
5470,HEAD.,"One friend not quite a hypocrite,"
5471,HEAD.,One woman not a liar!
5472,HEAD.,
5473,HEAD.,"I think poor beggars court St. Giles,"
5474,HEAD.,Rich beggars court St. Stephen;
5475,HEAD.,"And death looks down with nods and smiles,"
5476,HEAD.,And makes the odds all even:
5477,HEAD.,"I think some die upon the field,"
5478,HEAD.,"And some upon the billow,"
5479,HEAD.,"And some are laid beneath a shield,"
5480,HEAD.,And some beneath a willow.
5481,HEAD.,
5482,HEAD.,I think that very few have sighed
5483,HEAD.,"When Fate at last has found them,"
5484,HEAD.,"Though bitter foes were by their side,"
5485,HEAD.,And barren moss around them:
5486,HEAD.,"I think that some have died of drought,"
5487,HEAD.,And some have died of drinking;
5488,HEAD.,"I think that nought is worth a thought,--"
5489,HEAD.,And I’m a fool for thinking!

5567,L’INCONNUE.,For Fancy’s wild and witching mirth
5568,L’INCONNUE.,"Was dearer than aught I found on earth,"

5571,L’INCONNUE.,
5572,L’INCONNUE.,Many an eye that once was bright
5573,L’INCONNUE.,Is dark to-day in gloom;

5798,--HORACE.,
5799,--HORACE.,
5800,--HORACE.,"There was a time, when I could feel"
5801,--HORACE.,All passion’s hopes and fears;
5802,--HORACE.,And tell what tongues can ne’er reveal
5803,--HORACE.,By smiles and sighs and tears.
5804,--HORACE.,The days are gone! no more--no more
5805,--HORACE.,The cruel Fates allow;
5806,--HORACE.,"And though I’m hardly twenty-four,--"
5807,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now.
5808,--HORACE.,"Lady, the mist is on my sight,"
5809,--HORACE.,The chill is on my brow;
5810,--HORACE.,"My day is night, my bloom is blight;"
5811,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!
5812,--HORACE.,
5813,--HORACE.,"I never talk about the clouds,"
5814,--HORACE.,"I laugh at girls and boys,"
5815,--HORACE.,"I’m growing rather fond of crowds,"
5816,--HORACE.,And very fond of noise;
5817,--HORACE.,I never wander forth alone
5818,--HORACE.,Upon the mountain’s brow;
5819,--HORACE.,"I weighed, last winter, sixteen stone;--"
5820,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!
5821,--HORACE.,
5822,--HORACE.,"I never wish to raise a veil,"
5823,--HORACE.,I never raise a sigh;
5824,--HORACE.,"I never tell a tender tale,"
5825,--HORACE.,I never tell a lie:
5826,--HORACE.,"I cannot kneel, as once I did;"
5827,--HORACE.,I’ve quite forgot my bow;
5828,--HORACE.,I never do as I am bid;--
5829,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!
5830,--HORACE.,
5831,--HORACE.,"I make strange blunders every day,"
5832,--HORACE.,If I would be gallant;
5833,--HORACE.,"Take smiles for wrinkles, black for grey,"
5834,--HORACE.,And nieces for their aunt:
5835,--HORACE.,"I fly from folly, though it flows"
5836,--HORACE.,From lips of loveliest glow;
5837,--HORACE.,I don’t object to length of nose;--
5838,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!
5839,--HORACE.,
5840,--HORACE.,"I find my Ovid very dry,"
5841,--HORACE.,"My Petrarch quite a pill,"
5842,--HORACE.,"Cut Fancy for Philosophy,"
5843,--HORACE.,Tom Moore for Mr. Mill.
5844,--HORACE.,"And belles may read, and beaux may write,--"
5845,--HORACE.,I care not who or how;
5846,--HORACE.,"I burnt my Album, Sunday night;--"
5847,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!
5848,--HORACE.,
5849,--HORACE.,I don’t encourage idle dreams
5850,--HORACE.,Of poison or of ropes:
5851,--HORACE.,I cannot dine on airy schemes;
5852,--HORACE.,I cannot sup on hopes:
5853,--HORACE.,"New milk, I own, is very fine,"
5854,--HORACE.,Just foaming from the cow;
5855,--HORACE.,But yet I want my pint of wine;--
5856,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!
5857,--HORACE.,
5858,--HORACE.,"When Laura sings young hearts away,"
5859,--HORACE.,I’m deafer than the deep;
5860,--HORACE.,"When Leonora goes to play,"
5861,--HORACE.,I sometimes go to sleep;
5862,--HORACE.,"When Mary draws her white gloves out,"
5863,--HORACE.,"I never dance, I vow,--"
5864,--HORACE.,“Too hot to kick one’s heel’s about!”
5865,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!
5866,--HORACE.,
5867,--HORACE.,"I’m busy, now, with state affairs;"
5868,--HORACE.,I prate of Pitt and Fox;
5869,--HORACE.,"I ask the price of rail-road shares,"
5870,--HORACE.,I watch the turns of stocks.
5871,--HORACE.,And this is life! no verdure blooms
5872,--HORACE.,Upon the withered bough:
5873,--HORACE.,I save a fortune in perfumes;--
5874,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!
5875,--HORACE.,
5876,--HORACE.,"I may be yet, what others are,"
5877,--HORACE.,"A boudoir’s babbling fool,"
5878,--HORACE.,"The flattered star of Bench or Bar,"
5879,--HORACE.,"A party’s chief, or tool:--"
5880,--HORACE.,"Come shower or sunshine, hope or fear,"
5881,--HORACE.,"The palace or the plough,--"
5882,--HORACE.,My heart and lute are broken here;--
5883,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!
5884,--HORACE.,"Lady, the mist is on my sight,"
5885,--HORACE.,The chill is on my brow;
5886,--HORACE.,"My day is night, my bloom is blight"
5887,--HORACE.,I’m not a lover now!

6679,THE VICAR.,"The man who lost his way, between"
6680,THE VICAR.,"St. Mary’s Hill and Sandy Thicket,"
6681,THE VICAR.,"Was always shown across the green,"

6684,THE VICAR.,Back flew the bolt of lissom lath;
6685,THE VICAR.,"Fair Margaret, in her tidy kirtle,"

6693,THE VICAR.,"Up rose the Reverend Dr. Brown,"
6694,THE VICAR.,Up rose the Doctor’s winsome marrow;
6695,THE VICAR.,"The lady laid her knitting down,"
6696,THE VICAR.,Her husband clasped his ponderous Barrow;
6697,THE VICAR.,"Whate’er the stranger’s caste or creed,"
6698,THE VICAR.,"Pundit or Papist, saint or sinner,"

6707,THE VICAR.,"With no new light on love or liquor,--"
6708,THE VICAR.,"Good sooth, the traveller was to blame,"
6709,THE VICAR.,"And not the Vicarage, nor the Vicar."
6710,THE VICAR.,
6711,THE VICAR.,"His talk was like a stream, which runs"
6712,THE VICAR.,With rapid change from rocks to roses:
6713,THE VICAR.,"It slipped from politics to puns,"
6714,THE VICAR.,It passed from Mahomet to Moses;
6715,THE VICAR.,Beginning with the laws which keep
6716,THE VICAR.,"The planets in their radiant courses,"

6731,THE VICAR.,Without refreshment on the road

6734,THE VICAR.,The hand and head that penned and planned them
6735,THE VICAR.,"For all who understood admired,"

6737,THE VICAR.,
6738,THE VICAR.,"He wrote, too, in a quiet way,"

6742,THE VICAR.,"True histories of last year’s ghost,"
6743,THE VICAR.,"Lines to a ringlet, or a turban,"

6748,THE VICAR.,Although he had a knack of joking;

6751,THE VICAR.,"And when religious sects ran mad,"
6752,THE VICAR.,"He held, in spite of all his learning,"
6753,THE VICAR.,"That if a man’s belief is bad,"
6754,THE VICAR.,It will not be improved by burning.
6755,THE VICAR.,
6756,THE VICAR.,"And he was kind, and loved to sit"
6757,THE VICAR.,"In the low hut or garnished cottage,"

6761,THE VICAR.,"And when his hand unbarred the shutter,"

6779,THE VICAR.,You reach it by a carriage entry;

6804,QUINCE.,"A tenement of brick and plaster,"
6805,QUINCE.,"Of which, for forty years and four,"
6806,QUINCE.,My good friend Quince was lord and master.
6807,QUINCE.,
6808,QUINCE.,Welcome was he in hut and hall
6809,QUINCE.,"To maids and matrons, peers and peasants;"
6810,QUINCE.,He won the sympathies of all
6811,QUINCE.,"By making puns, and making presents."
6812,QUINCE.,"Though all the parish were at strife,"
6813,QUINCE.,"He kept his counsel, and his carriage,"
6814,QUINCE.,"And laughed, and loved a quiet life,"
6815,QUINCE.,And shrank from Chancery suits--and marriage.
6816,QUINCE.,
6817,QUINCE.,Sound was his claret--and his head;
6818,QUINCE.,Warm was his double ale--and feelings;
6819,QUINCE.,His partner at the whist club said
6820,QUINCE.,That he was faultless in his dealings:
6821,QUINCE.,He went to church but once a week;
6822,QUINCE.,Yet Dr. Poundtext always found him
6823,QUINCE.,"An upright man, who studied Greek,"
6824,QUINCE.,And liked to see his friends around him.
6825,QUINCE.,
6826,QUINCE.,"Asylums, hospitals, and schools,"
6827,QUINCE.,"He used to swear, were made to cozen;"
6828,QUINCE.,"All who subscribed to them were fools,--"
6829,QUINCE.,And he subscribed to half-a-dozen:
6830,QUINCE.,It was his doctrine that the poor
6831,QUINCE.,"Were always able, never willing;"
6832,QUINCE.,And so the beggar at his door
6833,QUINCE.,"Had first abuse, and then--a shilling."
6834,QUINCE.,
6835,QUINCE.,"Some public principles he had,"
6836,QUINCE.,"But was no flatterer, nor fretter;"
6837,QUINCE.,"He rapped his box when things were bad,"
6838,QUINCE.,"And said, “I cannot make them better!”"
6839,QUINCE.,"And much he loathed the patriot’s snort,"
6840,QUINCE.,And much he scorned the placeman’s snuffle;
6841,QUINCE.,And cut the fiercest quarrels short
6842,QUINCE.,"With--“Patience, gentlemen--and shuffle!”"
6843,QUINCE.,
6844,QUINCE.,For full ten years his pointer Speed
6845,QUINCE.,Had couched beneath her master’s table;

6849,QUINCE.,They were the ugliest beasts in Devon;
6850,QUINCE.,"And none knew why he fed them both,"

6852,QUINCE.,
6853,QUINCE.,"Whene’er they heard his ring or knock,"
6854,QUINCE.,"Quicker than thought, the village slatterns"
6855,QUINCE.,"Flung down the novel, smoothed the frock,"
6856,QUINCE.,"And took up Mrs. Glasse, and patterns;"
6857,QUINCE.,Adine was studying baker’s bills;
6858,QUINCE.,Louisa looked the queen of knitters;
6859,QUINCE.,Jane happened to be hemming frills;
6860,QUINCE.,"And Bell, by chance, was making fritters."
6861,QUINCE.,
6862,QUINCE.,But all was vain; and while decay
6863,QUINCE.,"Came, like a tranquil moonlight, o’er him,"
6864,QUINCE.,"And found him gouty still, and gay,"
6865,QUINCE.,"With no fair nurse to bless or bore him,"
6866,QUINCE.,"His rugged smile and easy chair,"
6867,QUINCE.,"His dread of matrimonial lectures,"
6868,QUINCE.,"His wig, his stick, his powdered hair,"
6869,QUINCE.,Were themes for very strange conjectures.
6870,QUINCE.,
6871,QUINCE.,Some sages thought the stars above
6872,QUINCE.,Had crazed him with excess of knowledge;
6873,QUINCE.,Some heard he had been crost in love
6874,QUINCE.,Before he came away from college;
6875,QUINCE.,Some darkly hinted that his Grace
6876,QUINCE.,"Did nothing, great or small, without him;"
6877,QUINCE.,"Some whispered, with a solemn face,"
6878,QUINCE.,That there was “something odd about him!”
6879,QUINCE.,
6880,QUINCE.,"I found him, at three score and ten,"
6881,QUINCE.,"A single man, but bent quite double;"
6882,QUINCE.,Sickness was coming on him then
6883,QUINCE.,To take him from a world of trouble:
6884,QUINCE.,"He prosed of slipping down the hill,"
6885,QUINCE.,Discovered he grew older daily;
6886,QUINCE.,"One frosty day he made his will,--"
6887,QUINCE.,"The next, he sent for Doctor Bailey."
6888,QUINCE.,
6889,QUINCE.,"And so he lived,--and so he died!--"
6890,QUINCE.,When last I sat beside his pillow
6891,QUINCE.,"He shook my hand, and “Ah!” he cried,"
6892,QUINCE.,“Penelope must wear the willow.
6893,QUINCE.,Tell her I hugged her rosy chain
6894,QUINCE.,While life was flickering in the socket;

6907,QUINCE.,"“Whether I ought to die or not,"
6908,QUINCE.,My doctor cannot quite determine;
6909,QUINCE.,"It’s only clear that I shall rot,"
6910,QUINCE.,"And be, like Priam, food for vermin."
6911,QUINCE.,My debts are paid:--but Nature’s debt

7021,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM.,She wrote a charming hand--and oh!
7022,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM.,How sweetly all her notes were folded!
7023,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM.,
7024,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM.,Our love was like most other loves;--
7025,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM.,"A little glow, a little shiver,"

7030,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM.,"A miniature, a lock of hair,"

7036,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM.,Our meeting was all mirth and laughter:
7037,THE BELLE OF THE BALL-ROOM.,For in my heart’s most secret cell

7052,MY PARTNER.,"At Cheltenham, where one drinks one’s fill"

7055,MY PARTNER.,With old Sir Geoffrey’s daughter.
7056,MY PARTNER.,"Her cheek with summer’s rose might vie,"
7057,MY PARTNER.,When summer’s rose is newest;
7058,MY PARTNER.,"Her eyes were blue as autumn’s sky,"

7061,MY PARTNER.,"Of life’s most precious flowers,"
7062,MY PARTNER.,"For half her thoughts were of its sun,"
7063,MY PARTNER.,And half were of its showers.
7064,MY PARTNER.,
7065,MY PARTNER.,I spoke of novels:--_Vivian Grey_
7066,MY PARTNER.,"Was positively charming,"
7067,MY PARTNER.,"And _Almack’s_ infinitely gay,"
7068,MY PARTNER.,And _Frankenstein_ alarming;
7069,MY PARTNER.,"I said _De Vere_ was chastely told,"
7070,MY PARTNER.,"Thought well of _Herbert Lacy_,"
7071,MY PARTNER.,"Called Mr. Banim’s sketches “bold,”"
7072,MY PARTNER.,And Lady Morgan’s “racy.”
7073,MY PARTNER.,I vowed that last new thing of Hook’s
7074,MY PARTNER.,Was vastly entertaining;
7075,MY PARTNER.,"And Laura said,--“I doat on books,"
7076,MY PARTNER.,Because its always raining!”
7077,MY PARTNER.,
7078,MY PARTNER.,I talked of Music’s gorgeous fane;
7079,MY PARTNER.,"I raved about Rossini,"
7080,MY PARTNER.,"Hoped Renzi would come back again,"
7081,MY PARTNER.,And criticised Pacini;
7082,MY PARTNER.,"I wished the chorus-singers dumb,"
7083,MY PARTNER.,"The trumpets more pacific,"
7084,MY PARTNER.,"And eulogised Brocard’s _aplomb_,"
7085,MY PARTNER.,And voted Paul “terrific!”
7086,MY PARTNER.,"What cared she for Medea’s pride,"
7087,MY PARTNER.,Or Desdemona’s sorrow?
7088,MY PARTNER.,"“Alas!” my beauteous listener sighed,"
7089,MY PARTNER.,“We must have rain to-morrow!”
7090,MY PARTNER.,
7091,MY PARTNER.,I told her tales of other lands;
7092,MY PARTNER.,"Of ever-boiling fountains,"
7093,MY PARTNER.,"Of poisonous lakes and barren sands,"
7094,MY PARTNER.,"Vast forests, trackless mountains:"
7095,MY PARTNER.,"I painted bright Italian skies,"
7096,MY PARTNER.,"I lauded Persian roses,"
7097,MY PARTNER.,"Coined similes for Spanish eyes,"
7098,MY PARTNER.,And jests for Indian noses;
7099,MY PARTNER.,"I laughed at Lisbon’s love of mass,"
7100,MY PARTNER.,Vienna’s dread of treason:
7101,MY PARTNER.,And Laura asked me--where the glass
7102,MY PARTNER.,"Stood, at Madrid, last season?"
7103,MY PARTNER.,
7104,MY PARTNER.,"I broached whate’er had gone its rounds,"
7105,MY PARTNER.,"The week before, of scandal;"
7106,MY PARTNER.,"What made Sir Luke lay down his hounds,"
7107,MY PARTNER.,And Jane take up her Handel;

7109,MY PARTNER.,With the pale moon above her;
7110,MY PARTNER.,"Where Flora lost her false front teeth,"
7111,MY PARTNER.,And Anne her falser lover;
7112,MY PARTNER.,How Lord de B. and Mrs. L.
7113,MY PARTNER.,Had crossed the sea together:
7114,MY PARTNER.,"My shuddering partner cried, “O Ciel!"
7115,MY PARTNER.,"How _could_ they,--in such weather?”"
7116,MY PARTNER.,
7117,MY PARTNER.,Was she a Blue?--I put my trust
7118,MY PARTNER.,"In strata, petals, gases;"
7119,MY PARTNER.,A boudoir-pedant? I discussed
7120,MY PARTNER.,The toga and the fasces;
7121,MY PARTNER.,A Cockney-Muse? I mouthed a deal
7122,MY PARTNER.,Of folly from “Endymion;”
7123,MY PARTNER.,A saint? I praised the pious zeal
7124,MY PARTNER.,Of Messrs. Way & Simeon;
7125,MY PARTNER.,A politician?--it was vain
7126,MY PARTNER.,To quote the morning paper;
7127,MY PARTNER.,"The horrid phantoms came again,"
7128,MY PARTNER.,"Rain, Hail, and Snow, and Vapour."
7129,MY PARTNER.,
7130,MY PARTNER.,Flat flattery was my only chance;
7131,MY PARTNER.,"I acted deep devotion,"
7132,MY PARTNER.,"Found magic in her every glance,"
7133,MY PARTNER.,Grace in her every motion;
7134,MY PARTNER.,"I wasted all a stripling’s lore,"
7135,MY PARTNER.,"Prayer, passion, folly, feeling;"
7136,MY PARTNER.,"And wildly looked upon the floor,"
7137,MY PARTNER.,And mildly on the ceiling.
7138,MY PARTNER.,I envied gloves upon her arm
7139,MY PARTNER.,And shawls upon her shoulder;
7140,MY PARTNER.,"And, when my worship was most warm,"
7141,MY PARTNER.,She--“never found it colder.”
7142,MY PARTNER.,
7143,MY PARTNER.,I don’t object to wealth or land;
7144,MY PARTNER.,And she will have the giving
7145,MY PARTNER.,"Of an extremely pretty hand,"
7146,MY PARTNER.,"Some thousands, and a living."
7147,MY PARTNER.,"She makes silk purses, broiders stools,"
7148,MY PARTNER.,"Sings sweetly, dances finely,"
7149,MY PARTNER.,"Paints screens, subscribes to Sunday-schools,"
7150,MY PARTNER.,And sits a horse divinely.
7151,MY PARTNER.,But to be linked in life to her!--

7848,OUR BALL.,"But to me, you are still what I found you,"
7849,OUR BALL.,Before you grew clever and tall;

7898,--MOULTRIE.,Hunca Munca must have a huge sabre;

8147,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.
8148,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,
8149,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,
8150,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Once on a time, when sunny May"
8151,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Was kissing up the April showers,"
8152,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,I saw fair Childhood hard at play
8153,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,Upon a bank of blushing flowers:
8154,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Happy--he knew not whence or how,--"
8155,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"And smiling,--who could choose but love him?"
8156,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,For not more glad than Childhood’s brow
8157,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,Was the blue heaven that beamed above him.
8158,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,
8159,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Old Time, in most appalling wrath,"
8160,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,That valley’s green repose invaded;
8161,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"The brooks grew dry upon his path,"
8162,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"The birds were mute, the lilies faded."
8163,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"But Time so swiftly winged his flight,"
8164,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"In haste a Grecian tomb to batter,"
8165,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"That Childhood watched his paper kite,"
8166,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,And knew just nothing of the matter.
8167,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,
8168,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,With curling lip and glancing eye
8169,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,Guilt gazed upon the scene a minute;
8170,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,But Childhood’s glance of purity
8171,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Had such a holy spell within it,"
8172,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,That the dark demon to the air
8173,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Spread forth again his baffled pinion,"
8174,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"And hid his envy and despair,"
8175,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Self-tortured, in his own dominion."
8176,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,
8177,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Then stepped a gloomy phantom up,"
8178,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Pale, cypress-crowned, Night’s awful daughter,"
8179,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,And proffered him a fearful cup
8180,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,Full to the brim of bitter water;
8181,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,Poor Childhood bade her tell her name;
8182,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"And when the beldame muttered--“Sorrow,”"
8183,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,He said--“Don’t interrupt my game;
8184,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"I’ll taste it, if I must, to-morrow.”"
8185,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,
8186,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"The Muse of Pindus thither came,"
8187,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,And wooed him with the softest numbers
8188,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,That ever scattered wealth and fame
8189,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,Upon a youthful poet’s slumbers;
8190,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Though sweet the music of the lay,"
8191,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"To Childhood it was all a riddle,"
8192,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"And, “Oh,” he cried, “do send away"
8193,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,That noisy woman with the fiddle!”
8194,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,
8195,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Then Wisdom stole his bat and ball,"
8196,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"And taught him, with most sage endeavour,"
8197,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Why bubbles rise and acorns fall,"
8198,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,And why no toy may last for ever.
8199,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,She talked of all the wondrous laws
8200,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Which Nature’s open book discloses,"
8201,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"And Childhood, ere she made a pause,"
8202,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,Was fast asleep among the roses.
8203,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,
8204,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Sleep on, sleep on! oh! Manhood’s dreams"
8205,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Are all of earthly pain or pleasure,"
8206,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Of Glory’s toils, Ambition’s schemes,"
8207,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,Of cherished love or hoarded treasure:
8208,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,But to the couch where Childhood lies
8209,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"A more delicious trance is given,"
8210,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,"Lit up by rays from seraph eyes,"
8211,CHILDHOOD AND HIS VISITORS.,And glimpses of remembered Heaven!

8216,LOVE AT A ROUT.,LOVE AT A ROUT.
8217,LOVE AT A ROUT.,
8218,LOVE AT A ROUT.,
8219,LOVE AT A ROUT.,When some mad poet stops to muse
8220,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"About the moonlight and the dews,"
8221,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"The Fairies and the Fauns,"
8222,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"He’s apt to think, he’s apt to swear,"
8223,LOVE AT A ROUT.,That Cupid reigns not anywhere
8224,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Except in groves and lawns,"
8225,LOVE AT A ROUT.,That none have vulnerable livers
8226,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"But bards who haunt the banks of rivers,"
8227,LOVE AT A ROUT.,That none are fair enough for witches
8228,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"But maids who roam through dells and ditches,"
8229,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"That dreams are twice as sweet as dances,"
8230,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"That cities never breed romances,"
8231,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"That Beauty always keeps a cottage,"
8232,LOVE AT A ROUT.,And Innocence grows pure on pottage.
8233,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Yes! those dear dreams are all divine;
8234,LOVE AT A ROUT.,And those dear dreams have all been mine;
8235,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"I like the dawning of the day,"
8236,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"I like the smell of new-mown hay,"
8237,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"I like the peaches and the posies,--"
8238,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"But chiefly, when the season closes,"
8239,LOVE AT A ROUT.,I wander from my drowsy desk
8240,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"To revel in the picturesque,"
8241,LOVE AT A ROUT.,To hear beneath those hoary trees
8242,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"The far-off murmur of the seas,"
8243,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Or trace yon river’s many channels
8244,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"With Petrarch, and a brace of spaniels,"
8245,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Combining foolish rhymes together,"
8246,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"And killing sorrow, and shoe-leather."
8247,LOVE AT A ROUT.,
8248,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Then, as I see some village maid"
8249,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Go dancing down the sunny glade,"
8250,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Coquetting with her fond adorer
8251,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"As nobler dames have done before her,"
8252,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"“Give me,” I cry, “the quiet bliss"
8253,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Of souls like these, of scenes like this;"
8254,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Where damsels eat and sleep in peace,"
8255,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Where gallants never heard of Greece,"
8256,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Where day is day, and night is night,"
8257,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Where frocks--and morals--both are white;
8258,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Blue eyes below--blue skies above--
8259,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Here are the homes, the hearts, for Love!”"
8260,LOVE AT A ROUT.,But this is idle; I have been
8261,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"A sojourner in many a scene,"
8262,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"And picked up wisdom in my way,"
8263,LOVE AT A ROUT.,And cared not what I had to pay;
8264,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Smiling and weeping all the while,"
8265,LOVE AT A ROUT.,As other people weep and smile;
8266,LOVE AT A ROUT.,And I have learnt that Love is not
8267,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Confined to any hour or spot;
8268,LOVE AT A ROUT.,He lights the smile and fires the frown
8269,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Alike in desert and in town.
8270,LOVE AT A ROUT.,I think fair faces not more fair
8271,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"In Peebles, than in Portman Square,"
8272,LOVE AT A ROUT.,And glances not a ray more bright
8273,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"In moonbeams, than in candle-light;"
8274,LOVE AT A ROUT.,I think much witchcraft oft reposes
8275,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"In wreaths of artificial roses,"
8276,LOVE AT A ROUT.,And ringlets--I have ne’er disdained them
8277,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Because the barber has profaned them;
8278,LOVE AT A ROUT.,I’ve been half mad with half a million
8279,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Whose legs have never crossed a pillion,"
8280,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Whose hands have never dressed a salad,"
8281,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Whose lips have never sung a ballad:
8282,LOVE AT A ROUT.,I think that many a modern dance
8283,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Breeds pretty subjects for romance;
8284,LOVE AT A ROUT.,And many a concert has its springs
8285,LOVE AT A ROUT.,For breaking hearts as well as strings:
8286,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"In short, I’m very sure that all"
8287,LOVE AT A ROUT.,Who seek or sigh for Beauty’s thrall
8288,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"May breathe their vows, and feed their passion,"
8289,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"Though whist and waltzing keep in fashion,"
8290,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"And make the most enchanting sonnets,"
8291,LOVE AT A ROUT.,"In spite of diamonds, and French bonnets!"
8292,LOVE AT A ROUT.,
8293,LOVE AT A ROUT.,
8294,LOVE AT A ROUT.,

8298,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,
8299,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"I looked for Beauty:--on a throne,"
8300,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"A dazzling throne of light, I found her;"
8301,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,And Music poured its softest tone
8302,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And flowers their sweetest breath, around her."
8303,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"A score or two of idle gods,"
8304,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Some dressed as peers, and some as peasants,"
8305,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Were watching all her smiles and nods,"
8306,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,And making compliments and presents.
8307,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,
8308,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And first young Love, the rosy boy,"
8309,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Exhibited his bow and arrows,"
8310,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And gave her many a pretty toy,"
8311,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Torches, and bleeding hearts, and sparrows:"
8312,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"She told him, as he passed, she knew"
8313,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,Her court would scarcely do without him;
8314,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,But yet--she hoped they were not true--
8315,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,There were some awkward tales about him.
8316,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,
8317,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,Wealth deemed that magic had no charm
8318,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"More mighty than the gifts he brought her,"
8319,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,And linked around her radiant arm
8320,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,Bright diamonds of the purest water:
8321,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"The goddess, with a scornful touch,"
8322,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Unclasped the gaudy, galling fetter;"
8323,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And said,--she thanked him very much,--"
8324,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,She liked a wreath of roses better.
8325,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,
8326,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Then Genius snatched his golden lute,"
8327,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,And told a tale of love and glory:
8328,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,The crowd around were hushed and mute
8329,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,To hear so sad and sweet a story;
8330,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And Beauty marked the minstrel’s cheek,"
8331,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,So very pale--no bust was paler;
8332,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,Vowed she could listen for a week;
8333,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,But really--he _should_ change his tailor!
8334,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,
8335,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"As died the echo of the strings,"
8336,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"A shadowy Phantom kneeled before her,"
8337,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Looked all unutterable things,"
8338,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And swore, to see was to adore her;"
8339,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"He called her veil a cruel cloud,"
8340,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Her cheek a rose, her smile a battery:"
8341,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,She fancied it was Wit that bowed;--
8342,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,I’m almost certain it was Flattery.
8343,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,
8344,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,There was a beldame finding fault
8345,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,With every person’s every feature:
8346,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And by the sneer, and by the halt,"
8347,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,I knew at once the odious creature:
8348,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"“You see,” quoth Envy, “I am come"
8349,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,To bow--as is my bounden duty;--
8350,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,They tell me Beauty is at home;--
8351,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,Impossible! that _can’t_ be Beauty!”
8352,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,
8353,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,I heard a murmur far and wide
8354,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,Of “Lord! how quick the dotard passes!”
8355,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,As Time threw down at Beauty’s side
8356,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,The prettiest of his clocks and glasses;
8357,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,But it was noticed in the throng
8358,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,How Beauty marred the maker’s cunning;
8359,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"For when she talked, the hands went wrong;"
8360,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And when she smiled, the sands stopped running."
8361,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,
8362,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Death, in a doctor’s wig and gown,"
8363,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"Came, arm in arm with Lethe, thither,"
8364,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And crowned her with a withered crown,"
8365,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"And hinted, Beauty too must wither!"
8366,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"“Avaunt!” she cried,--“how came he here?"
8367,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,The frightful fiend! he’s my abhorrence!”
8368,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,"I went and whispered in her ear,"
8369,BEAUTY AND HER VISITORS.,“He shall not hurt you!--sit to Lawrence!”

8375,THE FORSAKEN.,
8376,THE FORSAKEN.,
8377,THE FORSAKEN.,"He never meets me as of old,"
8378,THE FORSAKEN.,As friends less cherished meet me;
8379,THE FORSAKEN.,"His glance is even calm and cold,"
8380,THE FORSAKEN.,To welcome or to greet me:
8381,THE FORSAKEN.,"His sighs ne’er follow where I move,"
8382,THE FORSAKEN.,Or tell what others’ sighs do;--
8383,THE FORSAKEN.,"But though his _lips_ ne’er say, “I love,”"
8384,THE FORSAKEN.,I often think his _eyes_ do!
8385,THE FORSAKEN.,
8386,THE FORSAKEN.,"He never turns, amid the throng,"
8387,THE FORSAKEN.,Where colder ears will listen;
8388,THE FORSAKEN.,Or gives one thought to that poor song
8389,THE FORSAKEN.,Once made his eyelids glisten;
8390,THE FORSAKEN.,"But sometimes when our glances meet,"
8391,THE FORSAKEN.,"As looks less warm--more wise--do,"
8392,THE FORSAKEN.,"Albeit his _lips_ ne’er say, “‘Tis sweet,”--"
8393,THE FORSAKEN.,I often think his _eyes_ do!
8394,THE FORSAKEN.,
8395,THE FORSAKEN.,Oh! brighter smiles than mine may glass
8396,THE FORSAKEN.,His hours of mirth or sorrow;
8397,THE FORSAKEN.,And fairer forms than mine may pass
8398,THE FORSAKEN.,Across his path to-morrow:
8399,THE FORSAKEN.,"But something whispers solace yet,"
8400,THE FORSAKEN.,As stars through darkened skies do;--
8401,THE FORSAKEN.,"His _lips_ ne’er say, “I don’t forget,”--"

8411,SECOND LOVE.,
8412,SECOND LOVE.,
8413,SECOND LOVE.,How shall I woo her!--I will stand
8414,SECOND LOVE.,Beside her when she sings;
8415,SECOND LOVE.,And watch that fine and fairy hand
8416,SECOND LOVE.,Flit o’er the quivering strings:
8417,SECOND LOVE.,"And I will tell her I have heard,"
8418,SECOND LOVE.,"Though sweet her song may be,"
8419,SECOND LOVE.,A voice whose every whispered word
8420,SECOND LOVE.,Was more than song to me.
8421,SECOND LOVE.,
8422,SECOND LOVE.,How shall I woo her?--I will gaze
8423,SECOND LOVE.,In sad and silent trance
8424,SECOND LOVE.,"On those blue eyes, whose liquid rays"
8425,SECOND LOVE.,Look love in every glance:
8426,SECOND LOVE.,"And I will tell her, eyes more bright,"
8427,SECOND LOVE.,"Though bright her own may beam,"
8428,SECOND LOVE.,Will fling a deeper spell to-night
8429,SECOND LOVE.,Upon me in my dream.
8430,SECOND LOVE.,
8431,SECOND LOVE.,How shall I woo her?--I will try
8432,SECOND LOVE.,"The charms of olden time,"
8433,SECOND LOVE.,"And swear by earth, and sea, and sky,"
8434,SECOND LOVE.,And rave in prose and rhyme:
8435,SECOND LOVE.,"And I will tell her, when I bent,"
8436,SECOND LOVE.,"My knee in other years,--"
8437,SECOND LOVE.,"I was not half so eloquent,--"
8438,SECOND LOVE.,I could not speak for tears!
8439,SECOND LOVE.,
8440,SECOND LOVE.,How shall I woo her?--I will bow
8441,SECOND LOVE.,Before the holy shrine;
8442,SECOND LOVE.,"And pray the prayer and vow the vow,"
8443,SECOND LOVE.,And press her lips to mine;
8444,SECOND LOVE.,"And I will tell her, when she parts"
8445,SECOND LOVE.,"From passion’s thrilling kiss,"
8446,SECOND LOVE.,That memory to many hearts
8447,SECOND LOVE.,Is dearer far than bliss.
8448,SECOND LOVE.,
8449,SECOND LOVE.,"Away, away, the chords are mute,"
8450,SECOND LOVE.,The bond is rent in twain;
8451,SECOND LOVE.,"You cannot wake that silent lute,"
8452,SECOND LOVE.,Nor clasp those links again;
8453,SECOND LOVE.,"Love’s toil, I know, is little cost,"
8454,SECOND LOVE.,Love’s perjury is light sin;
8455,SECOND LOVE.,"But souls that lose what I have lost,"

8465,HOPE AND LOVE.,"Which is my richest treasure,"
8466,HOPE AND LOVE.,"I saw, dear Susan, Love and Hope"
8467,HOPE AND LOVE.,Set out in search of pleasure:
8468,HOPE AND LOVE.,All mirth and smiles I saw them go;
8469,HOPE AND LOVE.,Each was the other’s banker;
8470,HOPE AND LOVE.,"For Hope took up her brother’s bow,"
8471,HOPE AND LOVE.,"And Love, his sister’s anchor."
8472,HOPE AND LOVE.,
8473,HOPE AND LOVE.,"They rambled on o’er vale and hill,"
8474,HOPE AND LOVE.,They passed by cot and tower;
8475,HOPE AND LOVE.,"Through summer’s glow and winter’s chill,"
8476,HOPE AND LOVE.,Through sunshine and through shower:
8477,HOPE AND LOVE.,But what did those fond playmates care
8478,HOPE AND LOVE.,"For climate, or for weather?"
8479,HOPE AND LOVE.,All scenes to them were bright and fair
8480,HOPE AND LOVE.,On which they gazed together.
8481,HOPE AND LOVE.,
8482,HOPE AND LOVE.,Sometimes they turned aside to bless
8483,HOPE AND LOVE.,"Some Muse and her wild numbers,"
8484,HOPE AND LOVE.,Or breathe a dream of holiness
8485,HOPE AND LOVE.,On Beauty’s quiet slumbers:
8486,HOPE AND LOVE.,"“Fly on,” said Wisdom, with cold sneers,"
8487,HOPE AND LOVE.,“I teach my friends to doubt you:”
8488,HOPE AND LOVE.,"“Come back,” said Age, with bitter tears,"
8489,HOPE AND LOVE.,“My heart is cold without you.”
8490,HOPE AND LOVE.,
8491,HOPE AND LOVE.,When Poverty beset their path
8492,HOPE AND LOVE.,"And threatened to divide them,"
8493,HOPE AND LOVE.,They coaxed away the beldame’s wrath
8494,HOPE AND LOVE.,"Ere she had breath to chide them,"
8495,HOPE AND LOVE.,"By vowing all her rags were silk,"
8496,HOPE AND LOVE.,"And all her bitters, honey,"
8497,HOPE AND LOVE.,"And showing taste for bread and milk,"
8498,HOPE AND LOVE.,And utter scorn of money.
8499,HOPE AND LOVE.,
8500,HOPE AND LOVE.,They met stern Danger in their way
8501,HOPE AND LOVE.,Upon a ruin seated;
8502,HOPE AND LOVE.,"Before him kings had quaked that day,"
8503,HOPE AND LOVE.,And armies had retreated:
8504,HOPE AND LOVE.,But he was robed in such a cloud
8505,HOPE AND LOVE.,"As Love and Hope came near him,"
8506,HOPE AND LOVE.,"That though he thundered long and loud,"
8507,HOPE AND LOVE.,They did not see or hear him.
8508,HOPE AND LOVE.,
8509,HOPE AND LOVE.,"A grey-beard joined them, Time by name;"
8510,HOPE AND LOVE.,And Love was nearly crazy
8511,HOPE AND LOVE.,"To find that he was very lame,"
8512,HOPE AND LOVE.,And also very lazy:
8513,HOPE AND LOVE.,"Hope, as he listened to her tale,"
8514,HOPE AND LOVE.,Tied wings upon his jacket;
8515,HOPE AND LOVE.,"And then they far outran the mail,"
8516,HOPE AND LOVE.,And far outsailed the packet.
8517,HOPE AND LOVE.,
8518,HOPE AND LOVE.,"And so, when they had safely passed"
8519,HOPE AND LOVE.,"O’er many a land and billow,"
8520,HOPE AND LOVE.,"Before a grave they stopped at last,"
8521,HOPE AND LOVE.,Beneath a weeping willow:
8522,HOPE AND LOVE.,The moon upon the humble mound
8523,HOPE AND LOVE.,Her softest light was flinging;
8524,HOPE AND LOVE.,And from the thickets all around
8525,HOPE AND LOVE.,Sad nightingales were singing.
8526,HOPE AND LOVE.,
8527,HOPE AND LOVE.,"“I leave you here,” quoth Father Time,"
8528,HOPE AND LOVE.,As hoarse as any raven;
8529,HOPE AND LOVE.,And Love kneeled down to spell the rhyme
8530,HOPE AND LOVE.,Upon the rude stone graven:
8531,HOPE AND LOVE.,"But Hope looked onward, calmly brave,"
8532,HOPE AND LOVE.,"And whispered, “Dearest brother--"
8533,HOPE AND LOVE.,"We’re parted on this side the grave,--"
8534,HOPE AND LOVE.,We’ll meet upon the other.”

8546,STANZAS.,
8547,STANZAS.,"Unscathed by long revolving years,"

10092,I.,
10093,I.,Sir Hilary charged at Agincourt;
10094,I.,"Sooth, ’twas an awful day!"
10095,I.,And though in that old age of sport
10096,I.,The rufflers of the camp and court
10097,I.,"Had little time to pray,"
10098,I.,’Tis said Sir Hilary muttered there
10099,I.,Two syllables by way of prayer:
10100,I.,
10101,I.,My First to all the brave and proud
10102,I.,Who see to-morrow’s sun:
10103,I.,"My next, with her cold and quiet cloud,"
10104,I.,To those who find their dewy shroud
10105,I.,Before to-day’s be done:
10106,I.,"And both together to all blue eyes,"
10107,I.,That weep when a warrior nobly dies.
10108,I.,
10109,I.,
10110,II.,II.
10111,II.,
10112,II.,My First in torrents bleak and black
10113,II.,"Was rustling from the sky,"
10114,II.,When with my Second at his back
10115,II.,Young Cupid wandered by;
10116,II.,“Now take me in; the moon hath past;
10117,II.,"I pray ye, take me in!"
10118,II.,"The lightnings flash, the hail falls fast,"
10119,II.,All Hades rides the thunder-blast;
10120,II.,I’m dripping to the skin!”
10121,II.,
10122,II.,"“I know thee well, thy songs and sighs;"
10123,II.,"A wicked god thou art,"
10124,II.,"And yet most welcome to the eyes,"
10125,II.,Most witching to the heart!”
10126,II.,"The wanderer prayed another prayer,"
10127,II.,And shook his drooping wing;
10128,II.,"The Lover bade him enter there,"
10129,II.,"And wrung my First from out his hair,"
10130,II.,And dried my Second’s string.
10131,II.,"And therefore--(so the urchin swore,"
10132,II.,"By Styx, the fearful river,"
10133,II.,"And by the shafts his quiver bore,"
10134,II.,And by his shining quiver)--
10135,II.,That Lover aye shall see my Whole
10136,II.,In life’s tempestuous Heaven;
10137,II.,"And when the lightnings cease to roll,"
10138,II.,Shall fix thereon his dreaming soul
10139,II.,In the deep calm of even.

10143,III.,
10144,III.,Alas! for that forgotten day
10145,III.,"When chivalry was nourished,"
10146,III.,"When none but friars learned to pray,"
10147,III.,And beef and beauty flourished;
10148,III.,"And fraud in kings was held accurst,"
10149,III.,"And falsehood sin was reckoned,"
10150,III.,"And mighty chargers bore my First,"
10151,III.,And fat monks wore my Second!
10152,III.,
10153,III.,"Oh, then I carried sword and shield,"
10154,III.,"And casque with flaunting feather,"
10155,III.,"And earned my spurs in battlefield,"
10156,III.,In winter and rough weather;
10157,III.,And polished many a sonnet up
10158,III.,"To ladies’ eyes and tresses,"
10159,III.,"And learned to drain my father’s cup,"
10160,III.,And loose my falcon’s jesses.
10161,III.,But dim is now my grandeur’s gleam;
10162,III.,The mongrel mob grows prouder;
10163,III.,"And everything is done by steam,"
10164,III.,And men are killed by powder:
10165,III.,"And now I feel my swift decay,"
10166,III.,"And give unheeded orders,"
10167,III.,"And rot in paltry state away,"
10168,III.,With Sheriffs and Recorders.
10169,III.,
10170,III.,
10171,IV.,IV.
10172,IV.,
10173,IV.,On the casement frame the wind beat high;
10174,IV.,Never a star was in the sky;
10175,IV.,"All Kenneth Hold was wrapt in gloom,"
10176,IV.,And Sir Everard slept in the Haunted Room.
10177,IV.,
10178,IV.,I sat and sang beside his bed;
10179,IV.,"Never a single word I said,"
10180,IV.,Yet did I scare his slumber;
10181,IV.,"And a fitful light in his eyeball glistened,"
10182,IV.,"And his cheek grew pale as he lay and listened,"
10183,IV.,For he thought or dreamt that Fiends and Fays
10184,IV.,Were reckoning o’er his fleeting days
10185,IV.,And telling out their number.
10186,IV.,Was it my Second’s ceaseless tone?
10187,IV.,On my Second’s hand he laid his own;
10188,IV.,The hand that trembled in his clasp
10189,IV.,Was crushed by his convulsive grasp.
10190,IV.,
10191,IV.,Sir Everard did not fear my First;--
10192,IV.,"He had seen it in shapes that men deem worst,"
10193,IV.,In many a field and flood;
10194,IV.,Yet in the darkness of that dread
10195,IV.,"His tongue was parched and his reason fled,"
10196,IV.,"And he watched, as the lamp burned low and dim,"
10197,IV.,"To see some Phantom, gaunt and grim,"
10198,IV.,Come dabbled o’er with blood.
10199,IV.,
10200,IV.,"Sir Everard kneeled, and strove to pray;"
10201,IV.,"He prayed for light and he prayed for day,"
10202,IV.,Till terror checked his prayer;
10203,IV.,"And ever I muttered, clear and well,"
10204,IV.,"“Click, click,” like a tolling bell,"
10205,IV.,"Till, bound by fancy’s magic spell,"
10206,IV.,Sir Everard fainted there.
10207,IV.,
10208,IV.,"And oft from that remembered night,"
10209,IV.,Around the taper’s flickering light
10210,IV.,"The wrinkled beldames told,"
10211,IV.,Sir Everard had knowledge won
10212,IV.,"Of many a murder darkly done,"
10213,IV.,"Of fearful sights, and fearful sounds,"
10214,IV.,And ghosts that walk their midnight rounds
10215,IV.,In the tower of Kenneth Hold!
10216,IV.,
10217,IV.,
10218,V.,V.
10219,V.,
10220,V.,The canvas rattled on the mast
10221,V.,"As rose the swelling sail,"
10222,V.,And gallantly the vessel past
10223,V.,Before the cheering gale;
10224,V.,"And on my First Sir Florice stood,"
10225,V.,"As the far shore faded now,"
10226,V.,And looked upon the lengthening flood
10227,V.,With a pale and pensive brow:--
10228,V.,“When I shall bear thy silken glove
10229,V.,"Where the proudest Moslem flee,"
10230,V.,"My lady love, my lady love,--"
10231,V.,O waste one thought on me!”
10232,V.,
10233,V.,Sir Florice lay in a dungeon cell
10234,V.,"With none to soothe or save,"
10235,V.,And high above his chamber fell
10236,V.,The echo of the wave;
10237,V.,"But still he struck my Second there,"
10238,V.,And bade its tones renew
10239,V.,These hours when every hue was fair
10240,V.,And every hope was true:--
10241,V.,“If still your angel footsteps move
10242,V.,"Where mine may never be,"
10243,V.,"My lady love, my lady love,"
10244,V.,O dream one dream of me!”
10245,V.,
10246,V.,Not long the Christian captive pined!
10247,V.,My Whole was round his neck;
10248,V.,A sadder necklace ne’er was twined
10249,V.,So white a skin to deck:
10250,V.,Queen Folly ne’er was yet content
10251,V.,"With gems or golden store,"
10252,V.,But he who wears this ornament
10253,V.,Will rarely sigh for more:--
10254,V.,"“My spirit to the Heaven above,"
10255,V.,"My body to the sea,"
10256,V.,"My heart to thee, my lady love,--"
10257,V.,O weep one tear for me!”
10258,V.,
10259,V.,
10260,VI.,VI.
10261,VI.,
10262,VI.,"Row on, row on!--The First may light"
10263,VI.,"My shallop o’er the wave to-night,"
10264,VI.,But she will hide in a little while
10265,VI.,The lustre of her silent smile;
10266,VI.,"For fickle she is, and changeful still,"
10267,VI.,"As a madman’s wish, or a woman’s will."
10268,VI.,
10269,VI.,"Row on, row on!--The Second is high"
10270,VI.,In my own bright lady’s balcony;
10271,VI.,"And she beside it, pale and mute,"
10272,VI.,"Untold her beads, untouched her lute,"
10273,VI.,Is wondering why her lover’s skiff
10274,VI.,So slowly glides to the lonely cliff.
10275,VI.,
10276,VI.,"Row on, row on!--When the Whole is fled,"
10277,VI.,"The song will be hushed and the rapture dead,"
10278,VI.,And I must go in my grief again
10279,VI.,"To the toils of day and the haunts of men,--"
10280,VI.,"To a future of fear and a present of care,"
10281,VI.,And Memory’s dream of the things that were.

10286,VII.,I graced Don Pedro’s revelry

10299,VII.,"Till he had dragged, as he was bid,"
10300,VII.,"Five score of Turks to Cadiz,--"
10301,VII.,"And this that gallant Spaniard did,"
10302,VII.,"For me, and for the Ladies."
10303,VII.,
10304,VII.,"To ride through mountains, where my First"
10305,VII.,"A banquet would be reckoned,--"

10307,VII.,Men vainly turn my Second;--
10308,VII.,"To leave the gates of fair Madrid,"

10393,PROSPECTUS.,
10394,PROSPECTUS.,The main idea in instituting this Edition is to provide the general
10395,PROSPECTUS.,"reader with a comprehensive Prose Library after his own heart,--an"
10396,PROSPECTUS.,"Edition, that is to say, cheap, without the reproach which cheapness"
10397,PROSPECTUS.,"usually implies, comprising volumes of shapely form, well printed, well"
10398,PROSPECTUS.,"bound, and thoroughly representative of the leading prose writers of all"
10399,PROSPECTUS.,"time. Placed thus upon a popular basis, making the principle of literary"
10400,PROSPECTUS.,"selection a broadly human rather than an academic one, the Edition will,"
10401,PROSPECTUS.,"the Publisher hopes, contest not ineffectually the critical suffrages of"
10402,PROSPECTUS.,the democratic shilling.
10403,PROSPECTUS.,
10404,PROSPECTUS.,"As in the CANTERBURY POETS issued from the same press, to which this"
10405,PROSPECTUS.,"aims at being a companion series, the _Editing_ of the volumes will be a"

10407,PROSPECTUS.,"freshly treated, suggestive Introductions, give just that account of the"
10408,PROSPECTUS.,book and its author which will enable the significance of both in life
10409,PROSPECTUS.,"and literature, and their relation to modern thought, to be readily"

10412,PROSPECTUS.,be done with careful zeal and with reverence always for the true spirit
10413,PROSPECTUS.,of the book. In the first volume a General Introduction by the Editor
10414,PROSPECTUS.,"will appear, explaining more fully the bearing of the series, which, in"
10415,PROSPECTUS.,"course of time, it is hoped, will form"
