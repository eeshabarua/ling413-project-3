127,WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS,"The poems written in 1804 were not numerous; and, with the exception of"
128,WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS,"'The Small Celandine', the stanzas beginning ""I wandered lonely as a"

134,WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS,"the terrace walk of Lancrigg during that year; while the 'Ode,"
135,WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS,"Intimations of Immortality' was altered and added to, although it did"
136,WORDSWORTH'S POETICAL WORKS,not receive its final form till 1806. In the sixth book of 'The

270,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"a Highland Girl', vol. ii. p. 389, or they may be lines in the present"
271,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"poem, which Wordsworth wrote at first for the 'Highland Girl', but"
272,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,afterwards transferred to this one. They _may_ have been the first four
273,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"lines of the later poem. The two should be read consecutively, and"

276,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"After Wordsworth's death, a writer in the 'Daily News', January"
277,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,1859--then understood to be Miss Harriet Martineau--wrote thus:
278,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
279,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"""In the 'Memoirs', by the nephew of the poet, it is said that these"
280,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,verses refer to Mrs. Wordsworth; but for half of Wordsworth's life it

283,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
284,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"This statement is much more than improbable; it is, I think, disproved"
285,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"by the Fenwick note. They cannot refer to the ""Lucy"" of the Goslar"
286,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"poems; and Wordsworth indicates, as plainly as he chose, to whom they"
287,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,actually do refer. Compare the Hon. Justice Coleridge's account of a
288,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"conversation with Wordsworth ('Memoirs', vol. ii. p. 306), in which the"
289,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,poet expressly said that the lines were written on his wife. The
290,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"question was, however, set at rest in a conversation of Wordsworth with"
291,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Henry Crabb Robinson, who wrote in his 'Diary' on"

293,FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"""May 12 (1842).--Wordsworth said that the poems 'Our walk was far"

424,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"""When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park, we saw a few"
425,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,daffodils close to the water side. We fancied that the sea had floated
426,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as"
427,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"we went along there were more, and yet more; and, at last, under the"
428,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a long belt of them along"
429,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpike road. I never saw"
430,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"daffodils so beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones, about and"
431,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"above them; some rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow"
432,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"for weariness; and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed"
433,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the
434,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"lake. They looked so gay, ever glancing, ever changing. This wind blew"
435,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,directly over the lake to them. There was here and there a little
436,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"knot, and a few stragglers higher up; but they were so few as not to"
437,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"disturb the simplicity, unity, and life of that one busy highway. We"
438,VARIANTS ON THE TEXT,"rested again and again. The bays were stormy, and we heard the waves"

1568,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Deem that by such fond hope the Youth was swayed,"

1570,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"That Julia, wanting yet the name of wife,"
1571,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Carried about her for a secret grief
1572,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,The promise of a mother.
1573,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,To conceal
1574,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"The threatened shame, the parents of the Maid                    70"
1575,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Found means to hurry her away by night,"
1576,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And unforewarned, that in some distant spot"
1577,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"She might remain shrouded in privacy,"
1578,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Until the babe was born. When morning came,"
1579,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"The Lover, thus bereft, stung with his loss,                     75"
1580,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And all uncertain whither he should turn,"
1581,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Chafed like a wild beast in the toils; but soon
1582,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Discovering traces of the fugitives,"
1583,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Their steps he followed to the Maid's retreat.
1584,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Easily may the sequel be divined--[3]                            80
1585,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Walks to and fro--watchings at every hour;

1590,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Her Lover!--thence a stolen interview,"
1591,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Accomplished under friendly shade of night.
1592,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1593,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,I pass the raptures of the pair;--such theme
1594,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Is, by innumerable poets, touched"
1595,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,In more delightful verse than skill of mine                      90
1596,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Could fashion; chiefly by that darling bard
1597,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Who told of Juliet and her Romeo,"
1598,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And of the lark's note heard before its time,"
1599,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,And of the streaks that laced the severing clouds

1601,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"The vacant city slept; the busy winds,"
1602,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"That keep no certain intervals of rest,"
1603,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Moved not; meanwhile the galaxy displayed
1604,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Her fires, that like mysterious pulses beat"
1605,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Aloft;--momentous but uneasy bliss!                             100
1606,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,To their full hearts the universe seemed hung
1607,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,On that brief meeting's slender filament!
1608,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1609,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,They parted; and the generous Vaudracour
1610,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Reached speedily the native threshold, bent"
1611,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,On making (so the Lovers had agreed)                            105
1612,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,A sacrifice of birthright to attain
1613,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,A final portion from his father's hand;
1614,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Which granted, Bride and Bridegroom then would flee"
1615,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"To some remote and solitary place,"
1616,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Shady as night, and beautiful as heaven,                        110"
1617,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Where they may live, with no one to behold"
1618,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Their happiness, or to disturb their love."
1619,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"But _now_ of this no whisper; not the less,"
1620,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,If ever an obtrusive word were dropped
1621,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Touching the matter of his passion, still,                      115"
1622,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"In his stern father's hearing, Vaudracour"
1623,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Persisted openly that death alone
1624,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Should abrogate his human privilege
1625,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Divine, of swearing everlasting truth,"

1630,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Muttered the Father.--From these words the Youth [4]
1631,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Conceived a terror; and, by night or day,"
1632,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Stirred nowhere without weapons, that full soon                 125"
1633,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Found dreadful provocation: for at night [5]
1634,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"When to his chamber he retired, attempt"
1635,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Was made to seize him by three armèd men,"
1636,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Acting, in furtherance of the father's will,"
1637,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Under a private signet of the State.                            130
1638,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,One the rash Youth's ungovernable hand
1639,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Slew, and as quickly to a second gave [6]"
1640,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,A perilous wound--he shuddered to behold
1641,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,The breathless corse; then peacefully resigned
1642,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"His person to the law, was lodged in prison,                    135"
1643,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,And wore the fetters of a criminal.
1644,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1645,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Have you observed [7] a tuft of wingèd seed
1646,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"That, from the dandelion's naked stalk,"
1647,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Mounted aloft, is suffered not to use"
1648,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Its natural gifts for purposes of rest,                         140"
1649,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Driven by the autumnal whirlwind to and fro
1650,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Through the wide element? or have you marked

1652,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Within the vortex of a foaming flood,"
1653,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Tormented? by such aid you may conceive                         145
1654,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"The perturbation that ensued; [8]--ah, no!"
1655,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Desperate the Maid--the Youth is stained with blood;
1656,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Unmatchable on earth is their disquiet! [9]
1657,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Yet [10] as the troubled seed and tortured bough

1665,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,He clove to her who could not give him peace--
1666,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Yea, his first word of greeting was,--""All right"
1667,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Is gone from me; my lately-towering hopes,"
1668,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"To the least fibre of their lowest root,"
1669,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Are withered; thou no longer canst be mine,                     160"
1670,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,I thine--the conscience-stricken must not woo
1671,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"The unruffled Innocent,--I see thy face,"
1672,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Behold thee, and my misery is complete!"""
1673,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1674,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"""One, are we not?"" exclaimed the Maiden--""One,"
1675,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"For innocence and youth, for weal and woe?""                     165"
1676,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Then with the father's name she coupled words
1677,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Of vehement indignation; but the Youth
1678,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Checked her with filial meekness; for no thought
1679,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Uncharitable crossed his mind, no sense"
1680,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Of hasty anger rising in the eclipse [11]                       170
1681,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Of true domestic loyalty, did e'er"
1682,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Find place within his bosom.--Once again
1683,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,The persevering wedge of tyranny
1684,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Achieved their separation: and once more
1685,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Were they united,--to be yet again                              175"
1686,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Disparted, pitiable lot! But here"
1687,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,A portion of the tale may well be left
1688,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"In silence, though my memory could add"
1689,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Much how the Youth, in scanty space of time,"
1690,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Was traversed from without; much, too, of thoughts              180"
1691,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,That occupied his days in solitude
1692,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Under privation and restraint; and what,"
1693,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Through dark and shapeless fear of things to come,"
1694,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And what, through strong compunction for the past,"
1695,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,He suffered--breaking down in heart and mind!                   185
1696,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1697,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Doomed to a third and last captivity,"
1698,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,His freedom he recovered on the eve
1699,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Of Julia's travail. When the babe was born,"
1700,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Its presence tempted him to cherish schemes
1701,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Of future happiness. ""You shall return,                         190"
1702,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Julia,"" said he, ""and to your father's house"
1703,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Go with the child.--You have been wretched; yet
1704,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"The silver shower, whose reckless burthen weighs"
1705,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Too heavily upon the lily's head,"
1706,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Oft leaves a saving moisture at its root.                       195
1707,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Malice, beholding you, will melt away."
1708,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Go!--'tis a town where both of us were born;
1709,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"None will reproach you, for our truth is known;"
1710,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And if, amid those once-bright bowers, our fate"
1711,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Remain unpitied, pity is not in man.                            200"
1712,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"With ornaments--the prettiest, nature yields"
1713,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Or art can fashion, shall you deck our [12] boy,"
1714,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,And feed his countenance with your own sweet looks
1715,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Till no one can resist him.--Now, even now,"
1716,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,I see him sporting on the sunny lawn;                           205
1717,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,My father from the window sees him too;
1718,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Startled, as if some new-created thing"
1719,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Enriched the earth, or Faery of the woods"
1720,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Bounded before him;--but the unweeting Child
1721,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Shall by his beauty win his grandsire's heart                   210
1722,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"So that it shall be softened, and our loves"
1723,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"End happily, as they began!"""
1724,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1725,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,These gleams
1726,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Appeared but seldom; oftener was he seen
1727,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Propping a pale and melancholy face                             215
1728,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Upon the Mother's bosom; resting thus
1729,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"His head upon one breast, while from the other"
1730,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,The Babe was drawing in its quiet food.
1731,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"--That pillow is no longer to be thine,"
1732,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Fond Youth! that mournful solace now must pass                  220
1733,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Into the list of things that cannot be!
1734,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Unwedded Julia, terror-smitten, hears"
1735,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"The sentence, by her mother's lip pronounced,"
1736,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"That dooms her to a convent.--Who shall tell,"
1737,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Who dares report, the tidings to the lord                       225"
1738,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Of her affections? so they blindly asked
1739,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Who knew not to what quiet depths a weight
1740,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Of agony had pressed the Sufferer down:
1741,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"The word, by others dreaded, he can hear"
1742,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Composed and silent, without visible sign                       230"
1743,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Of even the least emotion. Noting this,"
1744,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,When the impatient object of his love
1745,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Upbraided him with slackness, he returned"
1746,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"No answer, only took the mother's hand"
1747,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And kissed it; seemingly devoid of pain,                        235"
1748,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Or care, that what so tenderly he pressed"
1749,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Was a dependant on [13] the obdurate heart
1750,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Of one who came to disunite their lives
1751,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"For ever--sad alternative! preferred,"
1752,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"By the unbending Parents of the Maid,                           240"
1753,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,To secret 'spousals meanly disavowed.
1754,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,--So be it!
1755,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1756,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,In the city he remained
1757,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,A season after Julia had withdrawn
1758,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"To those religious walls. He, too, departs--245"
1759,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Who with him?--even the senseless Little-one.
1760,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"With that sole charge he passed the city-gates,"
1761,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"For the last time, attendant by the side"
1762,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Of a close chair, a litter, or sedan,"
1763,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"In which the Babe was carried. To a hill,                       250"
1764,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"That rose a brief league distant from the town,"
1765,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,The dwellers in that house where he had lodged
1766,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Accompanied his steps, by anxious love"
1767,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Impelled;--they parted from him there, and stood"
1768,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Watching below till he had disappeared                          255
1769,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"On the hill top. His eyes he scarcely took,"
1770,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Throughout that journey, from the vehicle"
1771,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,(Slow-moving ark of all his hopes!) that veiled
1772,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"The tender infant: and at every inn,"
1773,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,And under every hospitable tree                                 260
1774,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"At which the bearers halted or reposed,"
1775,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Laid him with timid care upon his knees,"
1776,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And looked, as mothers ne'er were known to look,"
1777,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Upon the nursling which his arms embraced.
1778,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1779,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,This was the manner in which Vaudracour                       265
1780,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Departed with his infant; and thus reached
1781,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"His father's house, where to the innocent child"
1782,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Admittance was denied. The young man spake
1783,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"No word [14] of indignation or reproof,"
1784,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"But of his father begged, a last request,                       270"
1785,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,That a retreat might be assigned to him
1786,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Where in forgotten quiet he might dwell,"
1787,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,With such allowance as his wants required;
1788,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,For wishes he had none. To a lodge that stood
1789,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Deep in a forest, with leave given, at the age                  275"
1790,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Of four-and-twenty summers he withdrew;
1791,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And thither took with him his motherless Babe, [15]"
1792,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And one domestic for their common needs,"
1793,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,An aged woman. It consoled him here
1794,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"To attend upon the orphan, and perform                          280"
1795,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Obsequious service to the precious child,"
1796,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Which, after a short time, by some mistake"
1797,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Or indiscretion of the Father, died.--"
1798,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,The Tale I follow to its last recess
1799,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Of suffering or of peace, I know not which:                     285"
1800,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Theirs be the blame who caused the woe, not mine!"
1801,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1802,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,From this time forth he never shared a smile
1803,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,With mortal creature. An Inhabitant
1804,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Of that same town, in which the pair had left"
1805,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"So lively a remembrance of their griefs,                        290"
1806,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"By chance of business, coming within reach"
1807,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Of his retirement, to the forest lodge"
1808,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Repaired, but only found the matron there, [16]"
1809,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Who told him that his pains were thrown away,"
1810,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,For that her Master never uttered word                          295
1811,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,To living thing--not even to her.--Behold!
1812,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"While they were speaking, Vaudracour approached;"
1813,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"But, seeing some one near, as on the latch"
1814,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Of the garden-gate his hand was laid, he shrunk--[17]"
1815,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"And, like a shadow, glided out of view.                         300"
1816,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Shocked at his savage aspect, from the place"
1817,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,The visitor retired.
1818,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,
1819,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Thus lived the Youth
1820,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Cut off from all intelligence with man,"
1821,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,And shunning even the light of common day;                      305
1822,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Nor could the voice of Freedom, which through France"
1823,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Full speedily resounded, public hope,"
1824,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"Or personal memory of his own deep wrongs,"
1825,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,Rouse him: but in those solitary shades
1826,VAUDRACOUR AND JULIA,"His days he wasted, an imbecile mind!                           310"

3063,TO THE DAISY (#4),Sweet Flower! belike one day to have
3064,TO THE DAISY (#4),"A place upon thy Poet's grave,"
3065,TO THE DAISY (#4),I welcome thee once more:
3066,TO THE DAISY (#4),"But He, who was on land, at sea,"
3067,TO THE DAISY (#4),"My Brother, too, in loving thee,                        5"
3068,TO THE DAISY (#4),"Although he loved more silently,"
3069,TO THE DAISY (#4),Sleeps by his native shore.
3070,TO THE DAISY (#4),
3071,TO THE DAISY (#4),"Ah! hopeful, hopeful was the day"

3074,TO THE DAISY (#4),His wish was gained: a little time
3075,TO THE DAISY (#4),Would bring him back in manhood's prime
3076,TO THE DAISY (#4),"And free for life, these hills to climb;"
3077,TO THE DAISY (#4),With all his wants supplied.
3078,TO THE DAISY (#4),
3079,TO THE DAISY (#4),And full of hope day followed day                      15
3080,TO THE DAISY (#4),While that stout Ship at anchor lay
3081,TO THE DAISY (#4),Beside the shores of Wight;
3082,TO THE DAISY (#4),The May had then made all things green;
3083,TO THE DAISY (#4),"And, floating there, in pomp serene,"
3084,TO THE DAISY (#4),"That Ship was goodly to be seen,                       20"
3085,TO THE DAISY (#4),His pride and his delight!
3086,TO THE DAISY (#4),
3087,TO THE DAISY (#4),"Yet then, when called ashore, he sought"
3088,TO THE DAISY (#4),The tender peace of rural thought:
3089,TO THE DAISY (#4),In more than happy mood
3090,TO THE DAISY (#4),"To your abodes, bright daisy Flowers!                  25"
3091,TO THE DAISY (#4),"He then would steal at leisure hours,"
3092,TO THE DAISY (#4),"And loved you glittering in your bowers,"
3093,TO THE DAISY (#4),A starry multitude.
3094,TO THE DAISY (#4),
3095,TO THE DAISY (#4),But hark the word!--the ship is gone;--
3096,TO THE DAISY (#4),Returns from her long course: [1]--anon                30
3097,TO THE DAISY (#4),"Sets sail:--in season due,"
3098,TO THE DAISY (#4),Once more on English earth they stand:
3099,TO THE DAISY (#4),"But, when a third time from the land"
3100,TO THE DAISY (#4),"They parted, sorrow was at hand"
3101,TO THE DAISY (#4),For Him and for his crew.                              35
3102,TO THE DAISY (#4),
3103,TO THE DAISY (#4),Ill-fated Vessel!--ghastly shock!
3104,TO THE DAISY (#4),"--At length delivered from the rock,"
3105,TO THE DAISY (#4),The deep she hath regained;
3106,TO THE DAISY (#4),And through the stormy night they steer;
3107,TO THE DAISY (#4),"Labouring for life, in hope and fear,                  40"
3108,TO THE DAISY (#4),"To reach a safer shore [2]--how near,"
3109,TO THE DAISY (#4),Yet not to be attained!
3110,TO THE DAISY (#4),
3111,TO THE DAISY (#4),"""Silence!"" the brave Commander cried;"
3112,TO THE DAISY (#4),"To that calm word a shriek replied,"
3113,TO THE DAISY (#4),It was the last death-shriek.                          45
3114,TO THE DAISY (#4),--A few (my soul oft sees that sight)
3115,TO THE DAISY (#4),Survive upon the tall mast's height; [3]
3116,TO THE DAISY (#4),But one dear remnant of the night--
3117,TO THE DAISY (#4),For Him in vain I seek.
3118,TO THE DAISY (#4),
3119,TO THE DAISY (#4),Six weeks beneath the moving sea                       50
3120,TO THE DAISY (#4),He lay in slumber quietly;
3121,TO THE DAISY (#4),Unforced by wind or wave
3122,TO THE DAISY (#4),"To quit the Ship for which he died,"
3123,TO THE DAISY (#4),(All claims of duty satisfied;)
3124,TO THE DAISY (#4),And there they found him at her side;                  55
3125,TO THE DAISY (#4),And bore him to the grave.
3126,TO THE DAISY (#4),
3127,TO THE DAISY (#4),Vain service! yet not vainly done
3128,TO THE DAISY (#4),"For this, if other end were none,"
3129,TO THE DAISY (#4),"That He, who had been cast"
3130,TO THE DAISY (#4),Upon a way of life unmeet                              60
3131,TO THE DAISY (#4),"For such a gentle Soul and sweet,"
3132,TO THE DAISY (#4),Should find an undisturbed retreat
3133,TO THE DAISY (#4),"Near what he loved, at last--"
3134,TO THE DAISY (#4),
3135,TO THE DAISY (#4),That neighbourhood of grove and field
3136,TO THE DAISY (#4),"To Him a resting-place should yield,                   65"
3137,TO THE DAISY (#4),A meek man and a brave!
3138,TO THE DAISY (#4),The birds shall sing and ocean make
3139,TO THE DAISY (#4),A mournful murmur for _his_ sake;
3140,TO THE DAISY (#4),"And Thou, sweet Flower, shalt sleep and wake"
3141,TO THE DAISY (#4),Upon his senseless grave. [4]                          70

3635,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,"which, by acting as drains for the rainwater on the surface, would"
3636,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,have much interfered with the durability of the inscription. The
3637,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,available space for the panel remains 3 feet 7 in length by 1 foot 9
3638,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,"inches in depth. Owing to the fineness of the grain of the stone, it"
3639,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,may be quite possible to letter the native rock; but it has been
3640,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,difficult to fix on a style of lettering for the inscription that
3641,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,"shall be at once in good taste, forcible, and plain. It was proposed"
3642,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,that the Script type of letter which was made use of in the
3643,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,"inscription cut on the rock, in the late Mr. Ball's garden grounds"
3644,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,"below the Mount at Rydal, should be adopted; but a final decision has"
3645,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,been given in favour of a style of lettering which Mrs. Rawnsley has
3646,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,"designed. The panel is, from its position, certain to attract the eye"
3647,H. D. RAWNSLEY.,of the wanderer from Patterdale up to the Grisedale Pass.

4093,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,For the date of this poem in the Chronological Tables given in the

4096,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,by Mr. Carter in the edition of 1857. Captain Wordsworth perished on the
4097,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"5th of February 1805; and if the poem was written in 1805, it must have"
4098,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,been in the month of January of that year. The note to the poem is
4099,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"explicit--""Not long after"" he ""perished by shipwreck,"" etc. Thus the"
4100,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,poem _may_ have been written in the beginning of 1805; but it is not at
4101,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,all certain that part of it at least does not belong to an earlier year.
4102,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,John Wordsworth lived with his brother and sister at the Town-end
4103,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Cottage, Grasmere, during part of the winter, and during the whole of"
4104,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"the spring, summer, and autumn of 1800, William and John going together"
4105,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,on foot into Yorkshire from the 14th of May to the 7th of June. John
4106,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"left Grasmere on Michaelmas day (September 29th) 1800, and never"
4107,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,returned to it again. The following is Miss Wordsworth's record of that
4108,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,day in her Journal of 1800:
4109,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
4110,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"""On Monday, 29th, John left us. William and I parted with him in sight"
4111,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"of Ullswater. It was a fine day, showery, but with sunshine and fine"
4112,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"clouds. Poor fellow, my heart was right sad, I could not help thinking"
4113,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"we should see him again, because he was only going to Penrith."""
4114,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
4115,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"In the spring of 1801, John Wordsworth sailed for China in the"
4116,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"'Abergavenny'.  He returned from this voyage in safety, and the brothers"
4117,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"met once again in London. He went to sea again in 1803, and returned to"
4118,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"London in 1804, but could not visit Grasmere; and in the month of"
4119,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,February 1805--shortly after he was appointed to the command of the
4120,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"'Abergavenny'--the ship was lost at the Bill of Portland, and every one"
4121,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"on board perished. It is clear that the latter part of the poem, ""When,"
4122,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"to the attractions of the busy world,"" was written between John"
4123,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Wordsworth's departure from Grasmere and the loss of the 'Abergavenny',"
4124,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"i. e. between September 1800 and February 1805, as there are references"
4125,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,in it both to what his brother did at Grasmere and to his return to
4126,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,sea:

4128,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,'Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone.'
4129,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
4130,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,There are some things in the earlier part of the poem that appear to
4131,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,negative the idea of its having been written in 1800. The opening lines
4132,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant. He speaks of being
4133,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"""wont"" to do certain things. But, on the other hand, I find an entry in"
4134,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, which leads me to believe that the poem"
4135,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"may have been begun in 1800, and that the first part, ending (as it did"
4136,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,then) with the line:
4137,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
4138,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"'While she is travelling through the dreary sea,'"
4139,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
4140,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,may have been finished before John Wordsworth left Grasmere;
4141,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"the second part being written afterwards, while he was at sea;"
4142,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,and that this is the explanation of the date given in the editions
4143,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,"of 1815 and 1820, viz. 1802."

4170,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,
4171,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,To what poem Dorothy Wordsworth referred under the name of the

4178,SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT,

4391,CANTO FIRST,'Tis spent--this burning day of June!
4392,CANTO FIRST,Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing;
4393,CANTO FIRST,"The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round, is wheeling,--"
4394,CANTO FIRST,That solitary bird
4395,CANTO FIRST,Is all that can be heard [1]                                       5
4396,CANTO FIRST,In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon!
4397,CANTO FIRST,
4398,CANTO FIRST,"Confiding Glow-worms, 'tis a night"
4399,CANTO FIRST,Propitious to your earth-born light!

4402,CANTO FIRST,"Each, in his station twinkling not,"
4403,CANTO FIRST,Seems changed into a pallid spot. [2]
4404,CANTO FIRST,The mountains against heaven's grave weight

4423,CANTO FIRST,"He paces on, a trusty Guide,--"
4424,CANTO FIRST,Listen! you can scarcely hear!
4425,CANTO FIRST,Hither he his course is bending;--
4426,CANTO FIRST,"Now he leaves the lower ground,"
4427,CANTO FIRST,And up the craggy hill ascending                                  35
4428,CANTO FIRST,"Many a stop and stay he makes,"
4429,CANTO FIRST,Many a breathing-fit he takes;--[7]
4430,CANTO FIRST,"Steep the way and wearisome,"
4431,CANTO FIRST,Yet all the while his whip is dumb!

4433,CANTO FIRST,"The Horses have worked with right good-will,                    40"
4434,CANTO FIRST,And so [8] have gained the top of the hill;

4436,CANTO FIRST,"And now they smoothly glide along,"
4437,CANTO FIRST,"Recovering [9] breath, and pleased to win"

4439,CANTO FIRST,Heaven shield him from mishap and snare!
4440,CANTO FIRST,But why so early with this prayer?
4441,CANTO FIRST,Is it for threatenings in the sky?
4442,CANTO FIRST,Or for some other danger nigh?
4443,CANTO FIRST,"No; none is near him yet, though he                               50"
4444,CANTO FIRST,Be one of much infirmity; [10]
4445,CANTO FIRST,"For at the bottom of the brow,"
4446,CANTO FIRST,Where once the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
4447,CANTO FIRST,Offered a greeting of good ale
4448,CANTO FIRST,To all who entered Grasmere Vale;                                 55
4449,CANTO FIRST,And called on him who must depart
4450,CANTO FIRST,To leave it with a jovial heart;
4451,CANTO FIRST,"There, where the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH"
4452,CANTO FIRST,"Once hung, a Poet harbours now,"
4453,CANTO FIRST,A simple water-drinking Bard;                                     60
4454,CANTO FIRST,Why need our Hero then (though frail
4455,CANTO FIRST,His best resolves) be on his guard?
4456,CANTO FIRST,"He marches by, secure and bold;"
4457,CANTO FIRST,"Yet while he thinks on times of old,"
4458,CANTO FIRST,It seems that all looks wondrous cold;                            65
4459,CANTO FIRST,"He shrugs his shoulders, shakes his head,"
4460,CANTO FIRST,"And, for the honest folk within,"
4461,CANTO FIRST,It is a doubt with Benjamin
4462,CANTO FIRST,Whether they be alive or dead!
4463,CANTO FIRST,
4464,CANTO FIRST,"_Here_ is no danger,--none at all!                              70"
4465,CANTO FIRST,Beyond his wish he walks secure; [11]
4466,CANTO FIRST,"But pass a mile--and _then_ for trial,--"
4467,CANTO FIRST,Then for the pride of self-denial;
4468,CANTO FIRST,"If he resist that tempting door,"
4469,CANTO FIRST,Which with such friendly voice will call;                         75
4470,CANTO FIRST,"If he resist those casement panes,"
4471,CANTO FIRST,And that bright gleam which thence will fall
4472,CANTO FIRST,"Upon his Leaders' bells and manes,"
4473,CANTO FIRST,Inviting him with cheerful lure:
4474,CANTO FIRST,"For still, though all be dark elsewhere,                          80"
4475,CANTO FIRST,Some shining notice will be 'there'
4476,CANTO FIRST,Of open house and ready fare.
4477,CANTO FIRST,
4478,CANTO FIRST,The place to Benjamin right well [12]
4479,CANTO FIRST,"Is known, and by as strong a spell"
4480,CANTO FIRST,As used to be that sign of love                                   85
4481,CANTO FIRST,And hope--the OLIVE-BOUGH and DOVE;
4482,CANTO FIRST,"He knows it to his cost, good Man!"
4483,CANTO FIRST,Who does not know the famous SWAN?
4484,CANTO FIRST,"Object uncouth! and yet our boast, [13]"
4485,CANTO FIRST,For it was painted by the Host;                                   90
4486,CANTO FIRST,"His own conceit the figure planned,"
4487,CANTO FIRST,'Twas coloured all by his own hand;
4488,CANTO FIRST,"And that frail Child of thirsty clay,"
4489,CANTO FIRST,"Of whom I sing [14] this rustic lay,"
4490,CANTO FIRST,Could tell with self-dissatisfaction                              95
4491,CANTO FIRST,Quaint stories of the bird's attraction! [C]
4492,CANTO FIRST,
4493,CANTO FIRST,Well! that is past--and in despite
4494,CANTO FIRST,Of open door and shining light.
4495,CANTO FIRST,And now the conqueror essays
4496,CANTO FIRST,The long ascent of Dunmail-raise;                                100
4497,CANTO FIRST,And with his team is gentle here
4498,CANTO FIRST,As when he clomb from Rydal Mere;
4499,CANTO FIRST,His whip they do not dread--his voice
4500,CANTO FIRST,They only hear it to rejoice.
4501,CANTO FIRST,To stand or go is at _their_ pleasure;                           105
4502,CANTO FIRST,Their efforts and their time they measure
4503,CANTO FIRST,By generous pride within the breast;
4504,CANTO FIRST,"And, while they strain, and while they rest,"
4505,CANTO FIRST,He thus pursues his thoughts at leisure.
4506,CANTO FIRST,
4507,CANTO FIRST,Now am I fairly safe to-night--110
4508,CANTO FIRST,And with proud cause my heart is light: [15]
4509,CANTO FIRST,I trespassed lately worse than ever--
4510,CANTO FIRST,But Heaven has blest [16] a good endeavour;
4511,CANTO FIRST,"And, to my soul's content, [17] I find"
4512,CANTO FIRST,The evil One is left behind.                                     115
4513,CANTO FIRST,"Yes, let my master fume and fret,"
4514,CANTO FIRST,Here am I--with my horses yet!
4515,CANTO FIRST,"My jolly team, he finds that ye"
4516,CANTO FIRST,Will work for nobody but me!
4517,CANTO FIRST,Full proof of this the Country gained;                           120
4518,CANTO FIRST,"It knows how ye were vexed and strained,"
4519,CANTO FIRST,"And forced unworthy stripes to bear,"
4520,CANTO FIRST,When trusted to another's care. [18]
4521,CANTO FIRST,"Here was it--on this rugged slope,"
4522,CANTO FIRST,"Which now ye climb with heart and hope,                          125"
4523,CANTO FIRST,"I saw you, between rage and fear,"
4524,CANTO FIRST,"Plunge, and fling back a spiteful ear,"
4525,CANTO FIRST,"And ever more and more confused,"
4526,CANTO FIRST,As ye were more and more abused: [19]
4527,CANTO FIRST,"As chance would have it, passing by                              130"
4528,CANTO FIRST,I saw you in that [20] jeopardy:
4529,CANTO FIRST,A word from me was like a charm; [D]
4530,CANTO FIRST,Ye pulled together with one mind; [21]
4531,CANTO FIRST,"And your huge burthen, safe from harm,"
4532,CANTO FIRST,Moved like a vessel in the wind!                                 135
4533,CANTO FIRST,"--Yes, without me, up hills so high"
4534,CANTO FIRST,'Tis vain to strive for mastery.
4535,CANTO FIRST,"Then grieve not, jolly team! though tough"
4536,CANTO FIRST,"The road we travel, steep, and rough; [22]"
4537,CANTO FIRST,"Though Rydal-heights and Dunmail-raise,                          140"
4538,CANTO FIRST,"And all their fellow banks and braes,"
4539,CANTO FIRST,"Full often make you stretch and strain,"
4540,CANTO FIRST,"And halt for breath and halt again,"
4541,CANTO FIRST,Yet to their sturdiness 'tis owing
4542,CANTO FIRST,That side by side we still are going!                            145
4543,CANTO FIRST,
4544,CANTO FIRST,While Benjamin in earnest mood
4545,CANTO FIRST,"His meditations thus pursued,"
4546,CANTO FIRST,"A storm, which had been smothered long,"
4547,CANTO FIRST,Was growing inwardly more strong;
4548,CANTO FIRST,"And, in its struggles to get free,                               150"
4549,CANTO FIRST,Was busily employed as he.
4550,CANTO FIRST,The thunder had begun to growl--
4551,CANTO FIRST,"He heard not, too intent of soul;"
4552,CANTO FIRST,The air was now without a breath--
4553,CANTO FIRST,He marked not that 'twas still as death.                         155
4554,CANTO FIRST,But soon large rain-drops on his head [23]
4555,CANTO FIRST,Fell with the weight of drops of lead;--
4556,CANTO FIRST,"He starts--and takes, at the admonition,"
4557,CANTO FIRST,A sage survey of his condition. [24]
4558,CANTO FIRST,"The road is black before his eyes,                               160"
4559,CANTO FIRST,Glimmering faintly where it lies;
4560,CANTO FIRST,"Black is the sky--and every hill,"
4561,CANTO FIRST,"Up to the sky, is blacker still--"
4562,CANTO FIRST,"Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room, [25]"
4563,CANTO FIRST,Hung round and overhung with gloom;                              165
4564,CANTO FIRST,Save that above a single height
4565,CANTO FIRST,"Is to be seen a lurid light,"
4566,CANTO FIRST,"Above Helm-crag [E]--a streak half dead,"
4567,CANTO FIRST,A burning of portentous red;
4568,CANTO FIRST,"And near that lurid light, full well                             170"
4569,CANTO FIRST,"The ASTROLOGER, sage Sidrophel,"
4570,CANTO FIRST,"Where at his desk and book he sits,"
4571,CANTO FIRST,Puzzling aloft [26] his curious wits;
4572,CANTO FIRST,He whose domain is held in common
4573,CANTO FIRST,"With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN,                               175"
4574,CANTO FIRST,"Cowering beside her rifted cell,"
4575,CANTO FIRST,As if intent on magic spell;-
4576,CANTO FIRST,"Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,"
4577,CANTO FIRST,Still sit upon Helm-crag together!
4578,CANTO FIRST,
4579,CANTO FIRST,The ASTROLOGER was not unseen                                  180
4580,CANTO FIRST,By solitary Benjamin;
4581,CANTO FIRST,"But total darkness came anon,"
4582,CANTO FIRST,And he and every thing was gone:
4583,CANTO FIRST,"And suddenly a ruffling breeze,"
4584,CANTO FIRST,(That would have rocked the sounding trees                       185
4585,CANTO FIRST,Had aught of sylvan growth been there)
4586,CANTO FIRST,Swept through the Hollow long and bare: [27]
4587,CANTO FIRST,"The rain rushed down--the road was battered,"
4588,CANTO FIRST,As with the force of billows shattered;
4589,CANTO FIRST,"The horses are dismayed, nor know                                190"
4590,CANTO FIRST,Whether they should stand or go;
4591,CANTO FIRST,"And Benjamin is groping near them,"
4592,CANTO FIRST,"Sees nothing, and can scarcely hear them."
4593,CANTO FIRST,"He is astounded,--wonder not,--"
4594,CANTO FIRST,With such a charge in such a spot;                               195
4595,CANTO FIRST,Astounded in the mountain gap
4596,CANTO FIRST,"With thunder-peals, clap after clap,"
4597,CANTO FIRST,Close-treading on the silent flashes--
4598,CANTO FIRST,"And somewhere, as he thinks, by crashes [28]"
4599,CANTO FIRST,"Among the rocks; with weight of rain,                            200"
4600,CANTO FIRST,"And sullen [29] motions long and slow,"
4601,CANTO FIRST,That to a dreary distance go--
4602,CANTO FIRST,"Till, breaking in upon the dying strain,"
4603,CANTO FIRST,A rending o'er his head begins the fray again.
4604,CANTO FIRST,
4605,CANTO FIRST,"Meanwhile, uncertain what to do,                               205"
4606,CANTO FIRST,"And oftentimes compelled to halt,"
4607,CANTO FIRST,The horses cautiously pursue
4608,CANTO FIRST,"Their way, without mishap or fault;"
4609,CANTO FIRST,"And now have reached that pile of stones,"
4610,CANTO FIRST,Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;                          210
4611,CANTO FIRST,"He who had once supreme command,"
4612,CANTO FIRST,Last king of rocky Cumberland;
4613,CANTO FIRST,"His bones, and those of all his Power,"
4614,CANTO FIRST,Slain here in a disastrous hour!
4615,CANTO FIRST,
4616,CANTO FIRST,"When, passing through this narrow strait,                      215"
4617,CANTO FIRST,"Stony, and dark, and desolate,"
4618,CANTO FIRST,Benjamin can faintly hear
4619,CANTO FIRST,"A voice that comes from some one near,"
4620,CANTO FIRST,"A female voice:--""Whoe'er you be,"
4621,CANTO FIRST,"Stop,"" it exclaimed, ""and pity me!""                              220"
4622,CANTO FIRST,"And, less in pity than in wonder,"
4623,CANTO FIRST,"Amid the darkness and the thunder,"
4624,CANTO FIRST,"The Waggoner, with prompt command,"
4625,CANTO FIRST,Summons his horses to a stand.
4626,CANTO FIRST,
4627,CANTO FIRST,"While, with increasing agitation,                              225"
4628,CANTO FIRST,"The Woman urged her supplication,"
4629,CANTO FIRST,"In rueful words, with sobs between--"
4630,CANTO FIRST,The voice of tears that fell unseen; [30]
4631,CANTO FIRST,"There came a flash--a startling glare,"
4632,CANTO FIRST,And all Seat-Sandal was laid bare!                               230
4633,CANTO FIRST,"'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,"
4634,CANTO FIRST,"And Benjamin, without a question,"
4635,CANTO FIRST,"Taking her for some way-worn rover, [31]"
4636,CANTO FIRST,"Said, ""Mount, and get you under cover!"""
4637,CANTO FIRST,"Another voice, in tone as hoarse                                 235"
4638,CANTO FIRST,"As a swoln brook with rugged course,"
4639,CANTO FIRST,"Cried out, ""Good brother, why so fast?"
4640,CANTO FIRST,I've had a glimpse of you--'avast!'
4641,CANTO FIRST,"Or, since it suits you to be civil,"
4642,CANTO FIRST,"Take her at once--for good and evil!""                            240"
4643,CANTO FIRST,
4644,CANTO FIRST,"""It is my Husband,"" softly said"
4645,CANTO FIRST,"The Woman, as if half afraid:"
4646,CANTO FIRST,"By this time she was snug within,"
4647,CANTO FIRST,Through help of honest Benjamin;
4648,CANTO FIRST,"She and her Babe, which to her breast                            245"
4649,CANTO FIRST,With thankfulness the Mother pressed;
4650,CANTO FIRST,And now the same strong voice more near
4651,CANTO FIRST,"Said cordially, ""My Friend, what cheer?"
4652,CANTO FIRST,"Rough doings these! as God's my judge,"
4653,CANTO FIRST,The sky owes somebody a grudge!                                  250
4654,CANTO FIRST,We've had in half an hour or less
4655,CANTO FIRST,"A twelvemonth's terror [32] and distress!"""
4656,CANTO FIRST,
4657,CANTO FIRST,Then Benjamin entreats the Man
4658,CANTO FIRST,"Would mount, too, quickly as he can:"
4659,CANTO FIRST,"The Sailor--Sailor now no more,                                  255"
4660,CANTO FIRST,But such he had been heretofore--
4661,CANTO FIRST,"To courteous Benjamin replied,"
4662,CANTO FIRST,"""Go you your way, and mind not me;"
4663,CANTO FIRST,"For I must have, whate'er betide,"
4664,CANTO FIRST,"My Ass and fifty things beside,--260"
4665,CANTO FIRST,"Go, and I'll follow speedily!"""
4666,CANTO FIRST,
4667,CANTO FIRST,The Waggon moves--and with its load
4668,CANTO FIRST,Descends along the sloping road;
4669,CANTO FIRST,And the rough Sailor instantly
4670,CANTO FIRST,Turns to a little tent hard by: [33]                             265
4671,CANTO FIRST,"For when, at closing-in of day,"
4672,CANTO FIRST,"The family had come that way,"
4673,CANTO FIRST,Green pasture and the soft warm air
4674,CANTO FIRST,Tempted [34] them to settle there.--
4675,CANTO FIRST,"Green is the grass for beast to graze,                           270"
4676,CANTO FIRST,Around the stones of Dunmail-raise!
4677,CANTO FIRST,
4678,CANTO FIRST,"The Sailor gathers up his bed,"
4679,CANTO FIRST,Takes down the canvass overhead;
4680,CANTO FIRST,"And, after farewell to the place,"
4681,CANTO FIRST,"A parting word--though not of grace,                             275"
4682,CANTO FIRST,"Pursues, with Ass and all his store,"
4683,CANTO FIRST,The way the Waggon went before.
4684,CANTO FIRST,
4685,CANTO FIRST,
4686,CANTO FIRST,
4687,CANTO SECOND,CANTO SECOND
4688,CANTO SECOND,
4689,CANTO SECOND,
4690,CANTO SECOND,"If Wytheburn's modest House of prayer,"
4691,CANTO SECOND,"As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,"
4692,CANTO SECOND,"Had, with its belfry's humble stock,                             280"
4693,CANTO SECOND,"A little pair that hang in air,"
4694,CANTO SECOND,"Been mistress also of a clock,"
4695,CANTO SECOND,"(And one, too, not in crazy plight)"
4696,CANTO SECOND,Twelve strokes that clock would have been telling
4697,CANTO SECOND,Under the brow of old Helvellyn--285
4698,CANTO SECOND,"Its bead-roll of midnight,"
4699,CANTO SECOND,"Then, when the Hero of my tale"
4700,CANTO SECOND,"Was passing by, and, down the vale"
4701,CANTO SECOND,"(The vale now silent, hushed I ween"
4702,CANTO SECOND,As if a storm had never been)                                    290
4703,CANTO SECOND,Proceeding with a mind at ease;
4704,CANTO SECOND,While the old Familiar of the seas [35]
4705,CANTO SECOND,"Intent to use his utmost haste,"
4706,CANTO SECOND,"Gained ground upon the Waggon fast,"
4707,CANTO SECOND,And gives another lusty cheer;                                   295
4708,CANTO SECOND,"For spite of rumbling of the wheels,"
4709,CANTO SECOND,A welcome greeting he can hear;--
4710,CANTO SECOND,It is a fiddle in its glee
4711,CANTO SECOND,Dinning from the CHERRY TREE!
4712,CANTO SECOND,
4713,CANTO SECOND,Thence the sound--the light is there--300
4714,CANTO SECOND,"As Benjamin is now aware,"
4715,CANTO SECOND,"Who, to his inward thoughts confined,"
4716,CANTO SECOND,"Had almost reached the festive door,"
4717,CANTO SECOND,"When, startled by the Sailor's roar, [36]"
4718,CANTO SECOND,"He hears a sound and sees the light,                             305"
4719,CANTO SECOND,And in a moment calls to mind
4720,CANTO SECOND,That 'tis the village MERRY-NIGHT! [F]
4721,CANTO SECOND,
4722,CANTO SECOND,"Although before in no dejection,"
4723,CANTO SECOND,At this insidious recollection
4724,CANTO SECOND,"His heart with sudden joy is filled,--310"
4725,CANTO SECOND,"His ears are by the music thrilled,"
4726,CANTO SECOND,His eyes take pleasure in the road
4727,CANTO SECOND,Glittering before him bright and broad;
4728,CANTO SECOND,"And Benjamin is wet and cold,"
4729,CANTO SECOND,And there are reasons manifold                                   315
4730,CANTO SECOND,"That make the good, tow'rds which he's yearning,"
4731,CANTO SECOND,Look fairly like a lawful earning.
4732,CANTO SECOND,
4733,CANTO SECOND,"Nor has thought time to come and go,"
4734,CANTO SECOND,To vibrate between yes and no;
4735,CANTO SECOND,"For, cries the Sailor, ""Glorious chance                          320"
4736,CANTO SECOND,"That blew us hither!--let him dance,"
4737,CANTO SECOND,"Who can or will!--my honest soul,"
4738,CANTO SECOND,"Our treat shall be a friendly bowl!"" [37]"
4739,CANTO SECOND,"He draws him to the door--""Come in,"
4740,CANTO SECOND,"Come, come,"" cries he to Benjamin!                               325"
4741,CANTO SECOND,"And Benjamin--ah, woe is me!"
4742,CANTO SECOND,Gave the word--the horses heard
4743,CANTO SECOND,"And halted, though reluctantly."
4744,CANTO SECOND,
4745,CANTO SECOND,"""Blithe souls and lightsome hearts have we,"
4746,CANTO SECOND,"Feasting at the CHERRY TREE!""                                    330"
4747,CANTO SECOND,"This was the outside proclamation,"
4748,CANTO SECOND,This was the inside salutation;
4749,CANTO SECOND,What bustling--jostling--high and low!
4750,CANTO SECOND,A universal overflow!
4751,CANTO SECOND,What tankards foaming from the tap!                              335
4752,CANTO SECOND,What store of cakes in every lap!
4753,CANTO SECOND,What thumping--stumping--overhead!
4754,CANTO SECOND,The thunder had not been more busy:
4755,CANTO SECOND,"With such a stir you would have said,"
4756,CANTO SECOND,This little place may well be dizzy!                             340
4757,CANTO SECOND,'Tis who can dance with greatest vigour--
4758,CANTO SECOND,'Tis what can be most prompt and eager;
4759,CANTO SECOND,"As if it heard the fiddle's call,"
4760,CANTO SECOND,The pewter clatters on the wall;
4761,CANTO SECOND,"The very bacon shows its feeling,                                345"
4762,CANTO SECOND,Swinging from the smoky ceiling!
4763,CANTO SECOND,
4764,CANTO SECOND,"A steaming bowl, a blazing fire,"
4765,CANTO SECOND,What greater good can heart desire?
4766,CANTO SECOND,'Twere worth a wise man's while to try
4767,CANTO SECOND,The utmost anger of the sky:                                     350
4768,CANTO SECOND,"To _seek_ for thoughts of a gloomy cast,"
4769,CANTO SECOND,If such the bright amends at last. [38]
4770,CANTO SECOND,"Now should you say [39] I judge amiss,"
4771,CANTO SECOND,The CHERRY TREE shows proof of this;
4772,CANTO SECOND,"For soon of all [40] the happy there,                            355"
4773,CANTO SECOND,Our Travellers are the happiest pair;
4774,CANTO SECOND,All care with Benjamin is gone--
4775,CANTO SECOND,A Cæsar past the Rubicon!
4776,CANTO SECOND,"He thinks not of his long, long strife;--"
4777,CANTO SECOND,"The Sailor, Man by nature gay,                                   360"
4778,CANTO SECOND,Hath no resolves to throw away; [41]
4779,CANTO SECOND,"And he hath now forgot his Wife,"
4780,CANTO SECOND,Hath quite forgotten her--or may be
4781,CANTO SECOND,"Thinks her the luckiest soul on earth,"
4782,CANTO SECOND,"Within that warm and peaceful berth, [42]                        365"
4783,CANTO SECOND,"Under cover,"
4784,CANTO SECOND,"Terror over,"
4785,CANTO SECOND,Sleeping by her sleeping Baby.
4786,CANTO SECOND,
4787,CANTO SECOND,"With bowl that sped from hand to hand,"
4788,CANTO SECOND,"The gladdest of the gladsome band,                               370"
4789,CANTO SECOND,"Amid their own delight and fun, [43]"
4790,CANTO SECOND,"They hear--when every dance is done,"
4791,CANTO SECOND,When every whirling bout is o'er--[44]
4792,CANTO SECOND,"The fiddle's _squeak_ [G]--that call to bliss,"
4793,CANTO SECOND,Ever followed by a kiss;                                         375
4794,CANTO SECOND,"They envy not the happy lot,"
4795,CANTO SECOND,But enjoy their own the more!
4796,CANTO SECOND,
4797,CANTO SECOND,"While thus our jocund Travellers fare,"
4798,CANTO SECOND,Up springs the Sailor from his chair--
4799,CANTO SECOND,Limps (for I might have told before                              380
4800,CANTO SECOND,That he was lame) across the floor--
4801,CANTO SECOND,Is gone--returns--and with a prize;
4802,CANTO SECOND,With what?--a Ship of lusty size;
4803,CANTO SECOND,"A gallant stately Man-of-war,"
4804,CANTO SECOND,Fixed on a smoothly-sliding car.                                 385
4805,CANTO SECOND,"Surprise to all, but most surprise"
4806,CANTO SECOND,"To Benjamin, who rubs his eyes,"
4807,CANTO SECOND,Not knowing that he had befriended
4808,CANTO SECOND,A Man so gloriously attended!
4809,CANTO SECOND,
4810,CANTO SECOND,"""This,"" cries the Sailor, ""a Third-rate is--390"
4811,CANTO SECOND,"Stand back, and you shall see her gratis!"
4812,CANTO SECOND,"This was the Flag-ship at the Nile,"
4813,CANTO SECOND,"The Vanguard--you may smirk and smile,"
4814,CANTO SECOND,"But, pretty Maid, if you look near,"
4815,CANTO SECOND,You'll find you've much in little here!                          395
4816,CANTO SECOND,"A nobler ship did never swim,"
4817,CANTO SECOND,And you shall see her in full trim:
4818,CANTO SECOND,"I'll set, my friends, to do you honour,"
4819,CANTO SECOND,"Set every inch of sail upon her."""
4820,CANTO SECOND,"So said, so done; and masts, sails, yards,                       400"
4821,CANTO SECOND,He names them all; and interlards
4822,CANTO SECOND,"His speech with uncouth terms of art,"
4823,CANTO SECOND,Accomplished in the showman's part;
4824,CANTO SECOND,"And then, as from a sudden check,"
4825,CANTO SECOND,"Cries out--""'Tis there, the quarter-deck                         405"
4826,CANTO SECOND,On which brave Admiral Nelson stood--
4827,CANTO SECOND,A sight that would have roused your blood!
4828,CANTO SECOND,"One eye he had, which, bright as ten,"
4829,CANTO SECOND,Burned like a fire among his men;
4830,CANTO SECOND,"Let this be land, and that be sea,                               410"
4831,CANTO SECOND,"Here lay the French--and _thus_ came we!"" [H]"
4832,CANTO SECOND,
4833,CANTO SECOND,"Hushed was by this the fiddle's sound,"
4834,CANTO SECOND,"The dancers all were gathered round,"
4835,CANTO SECOND,"And, such the stillness of the house,"
4836,CANTO SECOND,You might have heard a nibbling mouse;                           415
4837,CANTO SECOND,"While, borrowing helps where'er he may,"
4838,CANTO SECOND,The Sailor through the story runs
4839,CANTO SECOND,Of ships to ships and guns to guns;
4840,CANTO SECOND,And does his utmost to display
4841,CANTO SECOND,"The dismal conflict, and the might                               420"
4842,CANTO SECOND,And terror of that marvellous [45] night!
4843,CANTO SECOND,"""A bowl, a bowl of double measure,"""
4844,CANTO SECOND,"Cries Benjamin, ""a draught of length,"
4845,CANTO SECOND,"To Nelson, England's pride and treasure,"
4846,CANTO SECOND,"Her bulwark and her tower of strength!""                          425"
4847,CANTO SECOND,"When Benjamin had seized the bowl,"
4848,CANTO SECOND,"The mastiff, from beneath the waggon,"
4849,CANTO SECOND,"Where he lay, watchful as a dragon,"
4850,CANTO SECOND,"Rattled his chain;--'twas all in vain,"
4851,CANTO SECOND,"For Benjamin, triumphant soul!                                   430"
4852,CANTO SECOND,He heard the monitory growl;
4853,CANTO SECOND,Heard--and in opposition quaffed
4854,CANTO SECOND,"A deep, determined, desperate draught!"
4855,CANTO SECOND,"Nor did the battered Tar forget,"
4856,CANTO SECOND,Or flinch from what he deemed his debt:                          435
4857,CANTO SECOND,"Then, like a hero crowned with laurel,"
4858,CANTO SECOND,Back to her place the ship he led;
4859,CANTO SECOND,Wheeled her back in full apparel;
4860,CANTO SECOND,"And so, flag flying at mast head,"
4861,CANTO SECOND,"Re-yoked her to the Ass:--anon,                                  440"
4862,CANTO SECOND,"Cries Benjamin, ""We must be gone."""
4863,CANTO SECOND,"Thus, after two hours' hearty stay,"
4864,CANTO SECOND,Again behold them on their way!
4865,CANTO SECOND,
4866,CANTO SECOND,
4867,CANTO THIRD,CANTO THIRD
4868,CANTO THIRD,
4869,CANTO THIRD,"Right gladly had the horses stirred,"
4870,CANTO THIRD,"When they the wished-for greeting heard,                         445"
4871,CANTO THIRD,"The whip's loud notice from the door,"
4872,CANTO THIRD,That they were free to move once more.
4873,CANTO THIRD,"You think, those [46] doings must have bred"
4874,CANTO THIRD,In them disheartening doubts and dread;
4875,CANTO THIRD,"No, not a horse of all the eight,                                450"
4876,CANTO THIRD,"Although it be a moonless night,"
4877,CANTO THIRD,Fears either for himself or freight;
4878,CANTO THIRD,"For this they know (and let it hide,"
4879,CANTO THIRD,"In part, the offences of their guide)"
4880,CANTO THIRD,"That Benjamin, with clouded brains,                              455"
4881,CANTO THIRD,Is worth the best with all their pains;
4882,CANTO THIRD,"And, if they had a prayer to make,"
4883,CANTO THIRD,The prayer would be that they may take
4884,CANTO THIRD,"With him whatever comes in course,"
4885,CANTO THIRD,The better fortune or the worse;                                 460
4886,CANTO THIRD,"That no one else may have business near them,"
4887,CANTO THIRD,"And, drunk or sober, he may steer them."
4888,CANTO THIRD,
4889,CANTO THIRD,"So, forth in dauntless mood they fare,"
4890,CANTO THIRD,And with them goes the guardian pair.
4891,CANTO THIRD,
4892,CANTO THIRD,"Now, heroes, for the true commotion,                           465"
4893,CANTO THIRD,The triumph of your late devotion!
4894,CANTO THIRD,"Can aught on earth impede delight,"
4895,CANTO THIRD,Still mounting to a higher height;
4896,CANTO THIRD,And higher still--a greedy flight!
4897,CANTO THIRD,"Can any low-born care pursue her,                                470"
4898,CANTO THIRD,Can any mortal clog come to her? [J]
4899,CANTO THIRD,"No notion have they--not a thought,"
4900,CANTO THIRD,That is from joyless regions brought!
4901,CANTO THIRD,"And, while they coast the silent lake,"
4902,CANTO THIRD,Their inspiration I partake;                                     475
4903,CANTO THIRD,"Share their empyreal spirits--yea,"
4904,CANTO THIRD,"With their enraptured vision, see--"
4905,CANTO THIRD,O fancy--what a jubilee!
4906,CANTO THIRD,What shifting pictures--clad in gleams
4907,CANTO THIRD,Of colour bright as feverish dreams!                             480
4908,CANTO THIRD,"Earth, spangled sky, and lake serene,"
4909,CANTO THIRD,Involved and restless all--a scene
4910,CANTO THIRD,"Pregnant with mutual exaltation,"
4911,CANTO THIRD,"Rich change, and multiplied creation!"
4912,CANTO THIRD,This sight to me the Muse imparts;--485
4913,CANTO THIRD,"And then, what kindness in their hearts!"
4914,CANTO THIRD,"What tears of rapture, what vow-making,"
4915,CANTO THIRD,"Profound entreaties, and hand-shaking!"
4916,CANTO THIRD,"What solemn, vacant, interlacing,"
4917,CANTO THIRD,As if they'd fall asleep embracing!                              490
4918,CANTO THIRD,"Then, in the turbulence of glee,"
4919,CANTO THIRD,"And in the excess of amity,"
4920,CANTO THIRD,"Says Benjamin, ""That Ass of thine,"
4921,CANTO THIRD,"He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine:"
4922,CANTO THIRD,"If he were tethered to the waggon,                               495"
4923,CANTO THIRD,He'd drag as well what he is dragging;
4924,CANTO THIRD,"And we, as brother should with brother,"
4925,CANTO THIRD,"Might trudge it alongside each other!"""
4926,CANTO THIRD,
4927,CANTO THIRD,"Forthwith, obedient to command,"
4928,CANTO THIRD,The horses made a quiet stand;                                   500
4929,CANTO THIRD,And to the waggon's skirts was tied
4930,CANTO THIRD,"The Creature, by the Mastiff's side,"
4931,CANTO THIRD,"The Mastiff wondering, and perplext"
4932,CANTO THIRD,With dread of what will happen next;
4933,CANTO THIRD,"And thinking it but sorry cheer,                                 505"
4934,CANTO THIRD,To have such company so near! [47]
4935,CANTO THIRD,
4936,CANTO THIRD,"This new arrangement made, the Wain"
4937,CANTO THIRD,Through the still night proceeds again;
4938,CANTO THIRD,No Moon hath risen her light to lend;
4939,CANTO THIRD,But indistinctly may be kenned                                   510
4940,CANTO THIRD,"The VANGUARD, following close behind,"
4941,CANTO THIRD,"Sails spread, as if to catch the wind!"
4942,CANTO THIRD,
4943,CANTO THIRD,"""Thy wife and child are snug and warm,"
4944,CANTO THIRD,Thy ship will travel without harm;
4945,CANTO THIRD,"I like,"" said Benjamin, ""her shape and stature:                  515"
4946,CANTO THIRD,And this of mine--this bulky creature
4947,CANTO THIRD,"Of which I have the steering--this,"
4948,CANTO THIRD,"Seen fairly, is not much amiss!"
4949,CANTO THIRD,"We want your streamers, friend, you know;"
4950,CANTO THIRD,"But, altogether [48] as we go,                                   520"
4951,CANTO THIRD,We make a kind of handsome show!
4952,CANTO THIRD,"Among these hills, from first to last,"
4953,CANTO THIRD,We've weathered many a furious blast;
4954,CANTO THIRD,"Hard passage forcing on, with head"
4955,CANTO THIRD,"Against the storm, and canvass spread.                           525"
4956,CANTO THIRD,I hate a boaster; but to thee
4957,CANTO THIRD,"Will say't, who know'st both land and sea,"
4958,CANTO THIRD,The unluckiest hulk that stems [49] the brine
4959,CANTO THIRD,"Is hardly worse beset than mine,"
4960,CANTO THIRD,When cross-winds on her quarter beat;                            530
4961,CANTO THIRD,"And, fairly lifted from my feet,"
4962,CANTO THIRD,I stagger onward--heaven knows how;
4963,CANTO THIRD,But not so pleasantly as now:
4964,CANTO THIRD,"Poor pilot I, by snows confounded,"
4965,CANTO THIRD,And many a foundrous pit surrounded!                             535
4966,CANTO THIRD,"Yet here we are, by night and day"
4967,CANTO THIRD,Grinding through rough and smooth our way;
4968,CANTO THIRD,Through foul and fair our task fulfilling;
4969,CANTO THIRD,"And long shall be so yet--God willing!"""
4970,CANTO THIRD,
4971,CANTO THIRD,"""Ay,"" said the Tar, ""through fair and foul--540"
4972,CANTO THIRD,"But save us from yon screeching owl!"""
4973,CANTO THIRD,That instant was begun a fray
4974,CANTO THIRD,Which called their thoughts another way:
4975,CANTO THIRD,"The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl!"
4976,CANTO THIRD,"What must he do but growl and snarl,                             545"
4977,CANTO THIRD,Still more and more dissatisfied
4978,CANTO THIRD,With the meek comrade at his side!
4979,CANTO THIRD,"Till, not incensed though put to proof,"
4980,CANTO THIRD,"The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof,"
4981,CANTO THIRD,Salutes the Mastiff on the head;                                 550
4982,CANTO THIRD,"And so were better manners bred,"
4983,CANTO THIRD,And all was calmed and quieted.
4984,CANTO THIRD,
4985,CANTO THIRD,"""Yon screech-owl,"" says the Sailor, turning"
4986,CANTO THIRD,"Back to his former cause of mourning,"
4987,CANTO THIRD,"""Yon owl!--pray God that all be well!                            555"
4988,CANTO THIRD,'Tis worse than any funeral bell;
4989,CANTO THIRD,"As sure as I've the gift of sight,"
4990,CANTO THIRD,"We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!"""
4991,CANTO THIRD,"--Said Benjamin, ""This whip shall lay"
4992,CANTO THIRD,"A thousand, if they cross our way.                               560"
4993,CANTO THIRD,"I know that Wanton's noisy station,"
4994,CANTO THIRD,I know him and his occupation;
4995,CANTO THIRD,The jolly bird hath learned his cheer
4996,CANTO THIRD,Upon [50] the banks of Windermere;
4997,CANTO THIRD,"Where a tribe of them make merry,                                565"
4998,CANTO THIRD,Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry;
4999,CANTO THIRD,"Hallooing from an open throat,"
5000,CANTO THIRD,Like travellers shouting for a boat.
5001,CANTO THIRD,--The tricks he learned at Windermere
5002,CANTO THIRD,This vagrant owl is playing here--570
5003,CANTO THIRD,That is the worst of his employment:
5004,CANTO THIRD,"He's at the top [51] of his enjoyment!"""
5005,CANTO THIRD,
5006,CANTO THIRD,"This explanation stilled the alarm,"
5007,CANTO THIRD,Cured the foreboder like a charm;
5008,CANTO THIRD,"This, and the manner, and the voice,                             575"
5009,CANTO THIRD,Summoned the Sailor to rejoice;
5010,CANTO THIRD,His heart is up--he fears no evil
5011,CANTO THIRD,"From life or death, from man or devil;"
5012,CANTO THIRD,"He wheels [52]--and, making many stops,"
5013,CANTO THIRD,Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops;                 580
5014,CANTO THIRD,"And, while he talked of blows and scars,"
5015,CANTO THIRD,"Benjamin, among the stars,"
5016,CANTO THIRD,Beheld a dancing--and a glancing;
5017,CANTO THIRD,Such retreating and advancing
5018,CANTO THIRD,"As, I ween, was never seen                                       585"
5019,CANTO THIRD,In bloodiest battle since the days of Mars!
5020,CANTO THIRD,
5021,CANTO THIRD,
5022,CANTO THIRD,
5023,CANTO FOURTH,CANTO FOURTH
5024,CANTO FOURTH,
5025,CANTO FOURTH,
5026,CANTO FOURTH,"Thus they, with freaks of proud delight,"
5027,CANTO FOURTH,Beguile the remnant of the night;
5028,CANTO FOURTH,And many a snatch of jovial song
5029,CANTO FOURTH,Regales them as they wind along;                                 590
5030,CANTO FOURTH,"While to the music, from on high,"
5031,CANTO FOURTH,The echoes make a glad reply.--
5032,CANTO FOURTH,But the sage Muse the revel heeds
5033,CANTO FOURTH,No farther than her story needs;
5034,CANTO FOURTH,Nor will she servilely attend                                    595
5035,CANTO FOURTH,The loitering journey to its end.
5036,CANTO FOURTH,--Blithe spirits of her own impel
5037,CANTO FOURTH,"The Muse, who scents the morning air,"
5038,CANTO FOURTH,To take of this transported pair
5039,CANTO FOURTH,A brief and unreproved farewell;                                 600
5040,CANTO FOURTH,"To quit the slow-paced waggon's side,"
5041,CANTO FOURTH,"And wander down yon hawthorn dell,"
5042,CANTO FOURTH,With murmuring Greta for her guide.
5043,CANTO FOURTH,--There doth she ken the awful form
5044,CANTO FOURTH,Of Raven-crag--black as a storm--605
5045,CANTO FOURTH,Glimmering through the twilight pale;
5046,CANTO FOURTH,"And Ghimmer-crag, [K] his tall twin brother,"
5047,CANTO FOURTH,Each peering forth to meet the other:--
5048,CANTO FOURTH,"And, while she roves [53] through St. John's Vale,"
5049,CANTO FOURTH,"Along the smooth unpathwayed plain,                              610"
5050,CANTO FOURTH,"By sheep-track or through cottage lane,"
5051,CANTO FOURTH,Where no disturbance comes to intrude
5052,CANTO FOURTH,"Upon the pensive solitude,"
5053,CANTO FOURTH,"Her unsuspecting eye, perchance,"
5054,CANTO FOURTH,"With the rude shepherd's favoured glance,                        615"
5055,CANTO FOURTH,"Beholds the faeries in array,"
5056,CANTO FOURTH,Whose party-coloured garments gay
5057,CANTO FOURTH,The silent company betray:
5058,CANTO FOURTH,"Red, green, and blue; a moment's sight!"
5059,CANTO FOURTH,For Skiddaw-top with rosy light                                  620
5060,CANTO FOURTH,Is touched--and all the band take flight.
5061,CANTO FOURTH,"--Fly also, Muse! and from the dell"
5062,CANTO FOURTH,Mount to the ridge of Nathdale Fell;
5063,CANTO FOURTH,"Thence, look thou forth o'er wood and lawn"
5064,CANTO FOURTH,Hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn;                           625
5065,CANTO FOURTH,"Across yon meadowy bottom look,"
5066,CANTO FOURTH,Where close fogs hide their parent brook;
5067,CANTO FOURTH,"And see, beyond that hamlet small,"
5068,CANTO FOURTH,"The ruined towers of Threlkeld-hall,"
5069,CANTO FOURTH,"Lurking in a double shade,                                       630"
5070,CANTO FOURTH,By trees and lingering twilight made!
5071,CANTO FOURTH,"There, at Blencathara's rugged feet,"
5072,CANTO FOURTH,Sir Lancelot gave a safe retreat
5073,CANTO FOURTH,To noble Clifford; from annoy
5074,CANTO FOURTH,"Concealed the persecuted boy,                                    635"
5075,CANTO FOURTH,Well pleased in rustic garb to feed
5076,CANTO FOURTH,"His flock, and pipe on shepherd's reed"
5077,CANTO FOURTH,"Among this multitude of hills,"
5078,CANTO FOURTH,"Crags, woodlands, waterfalls, and rills;"
5079,CANTO FOURTH,"Which soon the morning shall enfold,                             640"
5080,CANTO FOURTH,"From east to west, in ample vest"
5081,CANTO FOURTH,Of massy gloom and radiance bold.
5082,CANTO FOURTH,
5083,CANTO FOURTH,"The mists, that o'er the streamlet's bed"
5084,CANTO FOURTH,"Hung low, begin to rise and spread;"
5085,CANTO FOURTH,"Even while I speak, their skirts of grey                         645"
5086,CANTO FOURTH,Are smitten by a silver ray;
5087,CANTO FOURTH,And lo!--up Castrigg's naked steep
5088,CANTO FOURTH,"(Where, smoothly urged, the vapours sweep"
5089,CANTO FOURTH,"Along--and scatter and divide,"
5090,CANTO FOURTH,Like fleecy clouds self-multiplied)                              650
5091,CANTO FOURTH,"The stately waggon is ascending,"
5092,CANTO FOURTH,"With faithful Benjamin attending,"
5093,CANTO FOURTH,Apparent now beside his team--
5094,CANTO FOURTH,Now lost amid a glittering steam: [54]
5095,CANTO FOURTH,"And with him goes his Sailor-friend,                             655"
5096,CANTO FOURTH,By this time near their journey's end;
5097,CANTO FOURTH,"And, after their high-minded riot,"
5098,CANTO FOURTH,Sickening into thoughtful quiet;
5099,CANTO FOURTH,"As if the morning's pleasant hour,"
5100,CANTO FOURTH,Had for their joys a killing power.                              660
5101,CANTO FOURTH,"And, sooth, for Benjamin a vein"
5102,CANTO FOURTH,"Is opened of still deeper pain,"
5103,CANTO FOURTH,As if his heart by notes were stung
5104,CANTO FOURTH,From out the lowly hedge-rows flung;
5105,CANTO FOURTH,As if the warbler lost in light [L]                              665
5106,CANTO FOURTH,"Reproved his soarings of the night,"
5107,CANTO FOURTH,In strains of rapture pure and holy
5108,CANTO FOURTH,Upbraided his distempered folly. [55]
5109,CANTO FOURTH,
5110,CANTO FOURTH,"Drooping is he, his step is dull; [56]"
5111,CANTO FOURTH,But the horses stretch and pull;                                 670
5112,CANTO FOURTH,"With increasing vigour climb,"
5113,CANTO FOURTH,Eager to repair lost time;
5114,CANTO FOURTH,"Whether, by their own desert,"
5115,CANTO FOURTH,"Knowing what cause there is [57] for shame,"
5116,CANTO FOURTH,They are labouring to avert                                      675
5117,CANTO FOURTH,"As much as may be of the blame, [58]"
5118,CANTO FOURTH,"Which, they foresee, must soon alight"
5119,CANTO FOURTH,"Upon _his_ head, whom, in despite"
5120,CANTO FOURTH,"Of all his failings, they love best; [59]"
5121,CANTO FOURTH,"Whether for him they are distrest,                               680"
5122,CANTO FOURTH,"Or, by length of fasting roused,"
5123,CANTO FOURTH,Are impatient to be housed:
5124,CANTO FOURTH,Up against the hill they strain
5125,CANTO FOURTH,"Tugging at the iron chain,"
5126,CANTO FOURTH,"Tugging all with might and main,                                 685"
5127,CANTO FOURTH,"Last and foremost, every horse"
5128,CANTO FOURTH,To the utmost of his force!
5129,CANTO FOURTH,"And the smoke and respiration,"
5130,CANTO FOURTH,"Rising like an exhalation,"
5131,CANTO FOURTH,Blend [60] with the mist--a moving shroud                        690
5132,CANTO FOURTH,"To form, an undissolving cloud;"
5133,CANTO FOURTH,"Which, with slant ray, the merry sun"
5134,CANTO FOURTH,Takes delight to play upon.
5135,CANTO FOURTH,"Never golden-haired Apollo,"
5136,CANTO FOURTH,Pleased some favourite chief to follow                           695
5137,CANTO FOURTH,"Through accidents of peace or war,"
5138,CANTO FOURTH,In a perilous moment threw
5139,CANTO FOURTH,Around the object of his care
5140,CANTO FOURTH,Veil of such celestial hue; [61]
5141,CANTO FOURTH,Interposed so bright a screen--700
5142,CANTO FOURTH,Him and his enemies between!
5143,CANTO FOURTH,
5144,CANTO FOURTH,"Alas! what boots it?--who can hide,"
5145,CANTO FOURTH,When the malicious Fates are bent
5146,CANTO FOURTH,On working out an ill intent?
5147,CANTO FOURTH,Can destiny be turned aside?                                     705
5148,CANTO FOURTH,No--sad progress of my story!
5149,CANTO FOURTH,"Benjamin, this outward glory"
5150,CANTO FOURTH,"Cannot shield [62] thee from thy Master,"
5151,CANTO FOURTH,"Who from Keswick has pricked forth,"
5152,CANTO FOURTH,Sour and surly as the north;                                     710
5153,CANTO FOURTH,"And, in fear of some disaster,"
5154,CANTO FOURTH,"Comes to give what help he may,"
5155,CANTO FOURTH,And [63] to hear what thou canst say;
5156,CANTO FOURTH,"If, as needs he must forebode, [64]"
5157,CANTO FOURTH,Thou hast been loitering [65] on the road!                       715
5158,CANTO FOURTH,"His fears, his doubts, [66] may now take flight--"
5159,CANTO FOURTH,The wished-for object is in sight;
5160,CANTO FOURTH,"Yet, trust the Muse, it rather hath"
5161,CANTO FOURTH,Stirred him up to livelier wrath;
5162,CANTO FOURTH,"Which he stifles, moody man!                                     720"
5163,CANTO FOURTH,With all the patience that he can;
5164,CANTO FOURTH,"To the end that, at your meeting,"
5165,CANTO FOURTH,He may give thee decent greeting.
5166,CANTO FOURTH,
5167,CANTO FOURTH,"There he is--resolved to stop,"
5168,CANTO FOURTH,Till the waggon gains the top;                                   725
5169,CANTO FOURTH,But stop he cannot--must advance:
5170,CANTO FOURTH,"Him Benjamin, with lucky glance,"
5171,CANTO FOURTH,"Espies--and instantly is ready,"
5172,CANTO FOURTH,"Self-collected, poised, and steady:"
5173,CANTO FOURTH,"And, to be the better seen,                                      730"
5174,CANTO FOURTH,"Issues from his radiant shroud,"
5175,CANTO FOURTH,"From his close-attending cloud,"
5176,CANTO FOURTH,With careless air and open mien.

5207,CANTO FOURTH,"But drop the rest:--this aggravation,"
5208,CANTO FOURTH,"This complicated provocation,"
5209,CANTO FOURTH,A hoard of grievances unsealed;                                  765

5215,CANTO FOURTH,"When duty of that day was o'er,"
5216,CANTO FOURTH,Laid down his whip--and served no more.--
5217,CANTO FOURTH,"Nor could the waggon long survive,"
5218,CANTO FOURTH,Which Benjamin had ceased to drive:

5220,CANTO FOURTH,Ambitiously the office tried;
5221,CANTO FOURTH,But each unmanageable hill
5222,CANTO FOURTH,Called for _his_ patience and _his_ skill;--
5223,CANTO FOURTH,"And sure it is, that through this night,"

5237,CANTO FOURTH,Like pleasant sunbeams shifting still                            790
5238,CANTO FOURTH,Upon the side of a distant hill:
5239,CANTO FOURTH,But Nature might not be gainsaid;

5254,CANTO FOURTH,"We had a speaking diary,"
5255,CANTO FOURTH,"That in this uneventful place,"
5256,CANTO FOURTH,Gave to the days a mark and name
5257,CANTO FOURTH,By which we knew them when they came.                            810
5258,CANTO FOURTH,"--Yes, I, and all about me here,"
5259,CANTO FOURTH,"Through all the changes of the year,"

5266,CANTO FOURTH,The moving image to detain;

5268,CANTO FOURTH,"Of echoes, to his march kept time;"
5269,CANTO FOURTH,"When little other business stirred,"

6072,I,Several years after the event that forms the subject of the foregoing
6073,I,"poem, in company with my friend, the late Mr. Coleridge, I happened to"
6074,I,fall in with the person to whom the name of Benjamin is given. Upon our
6075,I,"expressing regret that we had not, for a long time, seen upon the road"
6076,I,"either him or his waggon, he said:--""They could not do without me; and"

6160,W. W.,
6161,W. W.,There is no poem more closely identified with the Grasmere district of
6162,W. W.,the English Lakes--and with the road from Grasmere to Keswick--than 'The
6163,W. W.,"Waggoner' is, and in none are the topographical allusions more minute"
6164,W. W.,and faithful.
6165,W. W.,
6166,W. W.,"Wordsworth seemed at a loss to know in what ""class"" of his poems to"
6167,W. W.,place 'The Waggoner;' and his frequent changes--removing it from one
6168,W. W.,"group to another--shew the artificial character of these classes. Thus,"
6169,W. W.,"in the edition of 1820, it stood first among the ""Poems of the Fancy."""
6170,W. W.,"In 1827 it was the last of the ""Poems founded on the Affections."" In"
6171,W. W.,"1832 it was reinstated among the ""Poems of the Fancy."" In 1836 it had a"
6172,W. W.,"place of its own, and was inserted between the ""Poems of the Fancy"" and"
6173,W. W.,"those ""Founded on the Affections;"" while in 1845 it was sent back to its"
6174,W. W.,"original place among the ""Poems of the Fancy;"" although in the table of"
6175,W. W.,"contents it was printed as an independent poem, closing the series."
6176,W. W.,
6177,W. W.,"The original text of 'The Waggoner' underwent little change, till the"
6178,W. W.,"year 1836, when it was carefully revised, and altered throughout. The"
6179,W. W.,"final edition of 1845, however, reverted, in many instances--especially"
6180,W. W.,in the first canto--to the original text of 1819.
6181,W. W.,
6182,W. W.,"As this poem was dedicated to Charles Lamb, it may be of interest to"
6183,W. W.,"note that, some six months afterwards, Lamb presented Wordsworth with a"
6184,W. W.,"copy of the first edition of 'Paradise Regained' (the edition of 1671),"
6185,W. W.,"writing on it the following sentence,"
6186,W. W.,
6187,W. W.,"""Charles Lamb, to the best knower of Milton, and therefore the"
6188,W. W.,"worthiest occupant of this pleasant edition.--Jan. 2nd, 1820."""
6189,W. W.,
6190,W. W.,The opening stanzas are unrivalled in their description of a sultry June
6191,W. W.,"evening, with a thunder-storm imminent."
6192,W. W.,
6193,W. W.,' 'Tis spent--this burning day of June!
6194,W. W.,Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing;

6196,W. W.,That solitary bird

6200,W. W.,...
6201,W. W.,The mountains against heaven's grave weight
6202,W. W.,"Rise up, and grow to wondrous height."
6203,W. W.,"The air, as in a lion's den,"
6204,W. W.,Is close and hot;--and now and then
6205,W. W.,Comes a tired and sultry breeze
6206,W. W.,"With a haunting and a panting,"
6207,W. W.,Like the stifling of disease;
6208,W. W.,"But the dews allay the heat,"
6209,W. W.,And the silence makes it sweet.'
6210,W. W.,
6211,W. W.,
6212,W. W.,"The Waggoner takes what is now the middle road, of the three leading"

6223,W. W.,"last of the ""Poems on the Naming of Places,"" on the left. He next passes"
6224,W. W.,"""The Wishing Gate"" on the left, John's Grove on the right, and descends"
6225,W. W.,by Dove Cottage--where Wordsworth lived--to Grasmere.
6226,W. W.,
6227,W. W.,"'... at the bottom of the brow,"
6228,W. W.,Where once the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
6229,W. W.,Offered a greeting of good ale
6230,W. W.,To all who entered Grasmere Vale;

6240,W. W.,Who does not know the famous SWAN?
6241,W. W.,"Object uncouth! and yet our boast,"
6242,W. W.,For it was painted by the Host;
6243,W. W.,"His own conceit the figure planned,"
6244,W. W.,'Twas coloured all by his own hand.'
6245,W. W.,
6246,W. W.,"As early as 1819, when the poem was first published, ""this rude piece of"
6247,W. W.,"self-taught art had been supplanted"" by a more pretentious figure. The"
6248,W. W.,"Waggoner passes the Swan,"
6249,W. W.,
6250,W. W.,'And now the conqueror essays
6251,W. W.,The long ascent of Dunmail-raise.'
6252,W. W.,

6254,W. W.,"hill, and sky are dark; and he barely sees the well-known rocks at the"
6255,W. W.,"summit of Helm-crag, where two figures seem to sit, like those on the"
6256,W. W.,"Cobbler, near Arrochar, in Argyle."
6257,W. W.,
6258,W. W.,"'Black is the sky--and every hill,"
6259,W. W.,"Up to the sky, is blacker still--"
6260,W. W.,"Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room,"
6261,W. W.,Hung round and overhung with gloom;
6262,W. W.,Save that above a single height
6263,W. W.,"Is to be seen a lurid light,"
6264,W. W.,"Above Helm-crag--a streak half dead,"
6265,W. W.,A burning of portentous red;

6276,W. W.,
6277,W. W.,"At the top of the ""raise""--the water-shed between the vales of Grasmere"
6278,W. W.,"and Wytheburn--he reaches the familiar pile of stones, at the boundary"
6279,W. W.,between the shires of Westmoreland and Cumberland.
6280,W. W.,
6281,W. W.,"'... that pile of stones,"

6288,W. W.,"description, in the last canto, of the ascent of the Raise by the"
6289,W. W.,"Waggoner on a summer morning, are as true to the spirit of the place as"
6290,W. W.,"anything that Wordsworth has written. He tells his friend Lamb, fourteen"
6291,W. W.,"years after he wrote the poem of 'The Waggoner,'"
6292,W. W.,
6293,W. W.,"'Yes, I, and all about me here,"

6316,W. W.,"As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,'"
6317,W. W.,
6318,W. W.,remains very much as it was in 1805; but the primitive simplicity and
6319,W. W.,"""lowliness"" of the chapel was changed by the addition a few years ago of"
6320,W. W.,"an apse, by the removal of some of the old rafters, and by the reseating"

6322,W. W.,

6324,W. W.,"celebrated, still stands on the eastern or Helvellyn side of the road."

6331,W. W.,"This rock was, until lately, one of the most interesting memorials of"
6332,W. W.,Wordsworth and his friends that survived in the Lake District; but the
6333,W. W.,"vale of Thirlmere is now a Manchester water-tank, and the place which"
6334,W. W.,knew the Rock of Names now knows it no more. It was a sort of trysting
6335,W. W.,place of the poets of Grasmere and Keswick--being nearly half-way
6336,W. W.,"between the two places--and there, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and other"
6337,W. W.,members of their households often met. When Coleridge left Grasmere for
6338,W. W.,"Keswick, the Wordsworths usually accompanied him as far as this rock;"
6339,W. W.,and they often met him there on his way over from Keswick to Grasmere.

6354,S. H.,"Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Wordsworth, and Sarah Hutchinson. The"
6355,S. H.,Wordsworths settled at Grasmere at the close of the year 1799. As
6356,S. H.,"mentioned in a previous note, John Wordsworth lived with his brother and"
6357,S. H.,"sister during most of that winter, and during the whole of the spring,"
6358,S. H.,"summer, and autumn of 1800, leaving it finally on September 29, 1800."
6359,S. H.,These names must therefore have been cut during the spring or summer of
6360,S. H.,"1800. There is no record of the occurrence, and no allusion to the rock,"
6361,S. H.,"in Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal of 1800. But that Journal, so"
6362,S. H.,"far as I have seen it, begins on the 14th of May 1800. Almost every"
6363,S. H.,detail of the daily life and ways of the household at Dove Cottage is so
6364,S. H.,"minutely recorded in it, that I am convinced that this incident of the"
6365,S. H.,"cutting of names in the Thirlmere Rock would have been mentioned, had it"
6366,S. H.,happened between the 14th of May and John Wordsworth's departure from
6367,S. H.,"Grasmere in September. Such references as this, for example, occur in"
6368,S. H.,the Journal:
6369,S. H.,
6370,S. H.,"""Saturday, August 2.--William and Coleridge went to Keswick. John went"
6371,S. H.,"with them to Wytheburn, and staid all day fishing."""
6372,S. H.,
6373,S. H.,I therefore infer that it was in the spring or early summer of 1800 that
6374,S. H.,the names were cut.
6375,S. H.,
6376,S. H.,I may add that the late Dean of Westminster--Dean Stanley--took much
6377,S. H.,interest in this Rock of Names; and doubt having been cast on the
6378,S. H.,"accuracy of the place and the genuineness of the inscriptions, in a"
6379,S. H.,"letter from Dr. Fraser, then Bishop of Manchester, which he forwarded to"
6380,S. H.,"me, he entered into the question with all the interest with which he was"
6381,S. H.,wont to track out details in the architecture or the history of a
6382,S. H.,Church.
6383,S. H.,
6384,S. H.,There were few memorials connected with Wordsworth more worthy of
6385,S. H.,"preservation than this ""upright mural block of stone."" When one"
6386,S. H.,remembered that the initials on the rock were graven by the hands of
6387,S. H.,"William and John Wordsworth, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, possibly with"
6388,S. H.,"the assistance of Dorothy Wordsworth, the two Hutchinsons (Mary and"
6389,S. H.,"Sarah), and that Wordsworth says of it,"
6390,S. H.,
6391,S. H.,'We worked until the Initials took
6392,S. H.,"Shapes that defied a scornful look,'"
6393,S. H.,
6394,S. H.,this Thirlmere Rock was felt to be a far more interesting memento of the
6395,S. H.,"group of poets that used to meet beside it, than the Stone in the"
6396,S. H.,"grounds of Rydal Mount, which was spared at Wordsworth's suit, ""from"
6397,S. H.,"some rude beauty of its own."" There was simplicity, as well as strength,"
6398,S. H.,in the way in which the initials were cut. But the stone was afterwards
6399,S. H.,"desecrated by tourists, and others, who had the audacity to scratch"
6400,S. H.,"their own names or initials upon it. In 1877 I wrote, ""The rock is as"
6401,S. H.,yet wonderfully free from such; and its preservation is probably due to
6402,S. H.,"the dark olive-coloured moss, with which the 'pure water trickling down'"
6403,S. H.,"has covered the face of the 'mural block,' and thus secured it from"
6404,S. H.,"observation, even on that highway;"" but I found in the summer of 1882"
6405,S. H.,that several other names had been ruthlessly added. When the Manchester
6406,S. H.,"Thirlmere scheme was finally resolved upon, an effort was made to remove"
6407,S. H.,"the Stone, with the view of its being placed higher up the hill on the"
6408,S. H.,"side of the new roadway. In the course of this attempt, the Stone was"
6409,S. H.,broken to pieces.

6433,S. H.,Greta issues from the lake. But there is no rock in the district now
6434,S. H.,"called by the name of Ghimmer-crag, or the crag of the Ewe-lamb. I am"
6435,S. H.,"inclined to think that Wordsworth referred to the ""Fisher-crag"" of the"
6436,S. H.,Ordnance Survey and the Guide Books. No other rock round Thirlmere can
6437,S. H.,"with any accuracy be called the ""tall twin brother"" of Raven-crag:"
6438,S. H.,"certainly not Great How, nor any spur of High Seat or Bleaberry Fell."
6439,S. H.,"Fisher-crag resembles Raven-crag, as seen from Thirlmere Bridge, or from"
6440,S. H.,the high road above it; and it is somewhat remarkable that Green--in his
6441,S. H.,Guide to the Lakes (a volume which the poet possessed)--makes use of the
6442,S. H.,same expression as that which Wordsworth adopts regarding these two
6443,S. H.,"crags, Raven and Fisher."

6490,S. H.,"admirers, do not quite satisfy me in their admiration of 'The"
6491,S. H.,"Waggoner', a poem which my dear uncle, Mr. Southey, preferred even to"
6492,S. H.,"the former. 'Ich will meine Denkungs Art hierin niemandem aufdringen',"
6493,S. H.,"as Lessing says: I will force my way of thinking on nobody, but take"
6494,S. H.,"the liberty, for my own gratification, to express it. The sketches of"
6495,S. H.,"hill and valley in this poem have a lightness, and spirit--an Allegro"
6496,S. H.,touch--distinguishing them from the grave and elevated splendour which
6497,S. H.,"characterises Mr. Wordsworth's representations of Nature in general,"
6498,S. H.,"and from the passive tenderness of those in 'The White Doe', while it"
6499,S. H.,harmonises well with the human interest of the piece; indeed it is the
6500,S. H.,harmonious sweetness of the composition which is most dwelt upon by
6501,S. H.,"its special admirers. In its course it describes, with bold brief"
6502,S. H.,"touches, the striking mountain tract from Grasmere to Keswick; it"
6503,S. H.,"commences with an evening storm among the mountains, presents a lively"
6504,S. H.,"interior of a country inn during midnight, and concludes after"
6505,S. H.,bringing us in sight of St. John's Vale and the Vale of Keswick seen
6506,S. H.,"by day-break--'Skiddaw touched with rosy light,' and the prospect from"
6507,S. H.,Nathdale Fell 'hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn:' thus giving a
6508,S. H.,"beautiful and well-contrasted Panorama, produced by the most delicate"
6509,S. H.,"and masterly strokes of the pencil. Well may Mr. Ruskin, a fine"
6510,S. H.,observer and eloquent describer of various classes of natural
6511,S. H.,"appearances, speak of Mr. Wordsworth as the great poetic landscape"
6512,S. H.,painter of the age. But Mr. Ruskin has found how seldom the great
6513,S. H.,landscape painters are powerful in expressing human passions and
6514,S. H.,"affections on canvas, or even successful in the introduction of human"
6515,S. H.,figures into their foregrounds; whereas in the poetic paintings of Mr.
6516,S. H.,Wordsworth the landscape is always subordinate to a higher interest;
6517,S. H.,"certainly, in 'The Waggoner', the little sketch of human nature which"
6518,S. H.,"occupies, as it were, the front of that encircling background, the"
6519,S. H.,"picture of Benjamin and his temptations, his humble friends and the"
6520,S. H.,"mute companions of his way, has a character of its own, combining with"
6521,S. H.,"sportiveness a homely pathos, which must ever be delightful to some of"
6522,S. H.,those who are thoroughly conversant with the spirit of Mr.
6523,S. H.,Wordsworth's poetry. It may be compared with the ale-house scene in
6524,S. H.,"'Tam o'Shanter', parts of Voss's Luise, or Ovid's Baucis and Philemon;"
6525,S. H.,though it differs from each of them as much as they differ from each
6526,S. H.,other. The Epilogue carries on the feeling of the piece very
6527,S. H.,"beautifully."""

6670,EXCURSION.,"This ""advertisement"" to the first edition of 'The Prelude,' published in"
6671,EXCURSION.,"1850--the year of Wordsworth's death--was written by Mr. Carter, who"
6672,EXCURSION.,"edited the volume. Mr. Carter was for many years the poet's secretary,"
6673,EXCURSION.,and afterwards one of his literary executors. The poem was not only kept
6674,EXCURSION.,"back from publication during Wordsworth's life-time, but it remained"
6675,EXCURSION.,"without a title; being alluded to by himself, when he spoke or wrote of"
6676,EXCURSION.,"it, as ""the poem on my own poetical education,"" the ""poem on my own"
6677,EXCURSION.,"life,"" etc."
6678,EXCURSION.,
6679,EXCURSION.,"As 'The Prelude' is autobiographical, a large part of Wordsworth's life"
6680,EXCURSION.,"might be written in the notes appended to it; but, besides breaking up"
6681,EXCURSION.,"the text of the poem unduly, this plan has many disadvantages, and would"
6682,EXCURSION.,render a subsequent and detailed life of the poet either unnecessary or
6683,EXCURSION.,repetitive. The notes which follow will therefore be limited to the
6684,EXCURSION.,"explanation of local, historical, and chronological allusions, or to"
6685,EXCURSION.,references to Wordsworth's own career that are not obvious without them.
6686,EXCURSION.,It has been occasionally difficult to decide whether some of the
6687,EXCURSION.,"allusions, to minute points in ancient history, mediæval mythology, and"
6688,EXCURSION.,"contemporary politics, should be explained or left alone; but I have"
6689,EXCURSION.,"preferred to err on the side of giving a brief clue to details, with"
6690,EXCURSION.,which every scholar is familiar.
6691,EXCURSION.,
6692,EXCURSION.,"'The Prelude' was begun as Wordsworth left the imperial city of Goslar,"
6693,EXCURSION.,"in Lower Saxony, where he spent part of the last winter of last century,"
6694,EXCURSION.,"and which he left on the 10th of February 1799. Only lines 1 to 45,"
6695,EXCURSION.,"however, were composed at that time; and the poem was continued at"
6696,EXCURSION.,"desultory intervals after the settlement at Grasmere, during 1800, and"
6697,EXCURSION.,following years. Large portions of it were dictated to his devoted
6698,EXCURSION.,"amanuenses as he walked, or sat, on the terraces of Lancrigg. Six books"
6699,EXCURSION.,were finished by 1805.
6700,EXCURSION.,
6701,EXCURSION.,"""The seventh was begun in the opening of that year; ... and the"
6702,EXCURSION.,"remaining seven were written before the end of June 1805, when his"
6703,EXCURSION.,"friend Coleridge was in the island of Malta, for the restoration of"
6704,EXCURSION.,"his health."""
6705,EXCURSION.,
6706,EXCURSION.,(The late Bishop of Lincoln.)
6707,EXCURSION.,
6708,EXCURSION.,There is no uncertainty as to the year in which the later books were
6709,EXCURSION.,written; but there is considerable difficulty in fixing the precise date
6710,EXCURSION.,of the earlier ones. Writing from Grasmere to his friend Francis
6711,EXCURSION.,"Wrangham--the letter is undated--Wordsworth says,"
6712,EXCURSION.,
6713,EXCURSION.,"""I am engaged in writing a poem on my own earlier life, which will"
6714,EXCURSION.,"take five parts or books to complete, three of which are nearly"
6715,EXCURSION.,"finished."""
6716,EXCURSION.,
6717,EXCURSION.,The late Bishop of Lincoln supposed that this letter to Wrangham was
6718,EXCURSION.,"written ""at the close of 1803, or beginning of 1804."" (See 'Memoirs of"
6719,EXCURSION.,"Wordsworth,' vol. i. p. 303.) There is evidence that it belongs to 1804."
6720,EXCURSION.,"At the commencement of the seventh book, p. 247, he says:"
6721,EXCURSION.,
6722,EXCURSION.,_Six changeful years_ have vanished since I first
6723,EXCURSION.,Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze
6724,EXCURSION.,Which met me issuing from the City's walls)
6725,EXCURSION.,_A glad preamble to this Verse:_ I sang
6726,EXCURSION.,"Aloud, with fervour irresistible"
6727,EXCURSION.,"Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,"
6728,EXCURSION.,"From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side"
6729,EXCURSION.,To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth
6730,EXCURSION.,"(So willed the Muse) _a less impetuous stream,"
6731,EXCURSION.,"That flowed awhile with unabating strength,"
6732,EXCURSION.,Then stopped for years; not audible again
6733,EXCURSION.,Before last primrose-time._
6734,EXCURSION.,
6735,EXCURSION.,I have _italicised_ the clauses which give some clue to the dates of
6736,EXCURSION.,"composition. From these it would appear that the ""glad preamble,"""
6737,EXCURSION.,"written on leaving Goslar in 1799 (which, I think, included only the"
6738,EXCURSION.,"first two paragraphs of book first), was a ""short-lived transport""; but"
6739,EXCURSION.,"that ""soon"" afterwards ""a less impetuous stream"" broke forth, which,"
6740,EXCURSION.,"after the settlement at Grasmere, ""flowed awhile with unabating"
6741,EXCURSION.,"strength,"" and then ""stopped for years."" Now the above passage,"
6742,EXCURSION.,"recording these things, was written in 1805, and in the late autumn of"
6743,EXCURSION.,that year; (as is evident from the reference which immediately follows
6744,EXCURSION.,"to the ""choir of redbreasts"" and the approach of winter). We must"
6745,EXCURSION.,"therefore assign the flowing of the ""less impetuous stream,"" to 1802; in"
6746,EXCURSION.,"order to leave room for the intervening ""years,"" in which it ceased to"
6747,EXCURSION.,"flow, till it was audible again in the spring of 1804, ""last"
6748,EXCURSION.,"primrose-time."""
6749,EXCURSION.,
6750,EXCURSION.,"A second reference to date occurs in the sixth book, p. 224, entitled"
6751,EXCURSION.,"""Cambridge and the Alps,"" in which he says,"
6752,EXCURSION.,
6753,EXCURSION.,"_Four years and thirty, told, this very week,_"
6754,EXCURSION.,Have I been now a sojourner on earth.
6755,EXCURSION.,
6756,EXCURSION.,This fixes definitely enough the date of the composition of _that_ part
6757,EXCURSION.,"of the work, _viz._ April 1804, which corresponds exactly to the ""last"
6758,EXCURSION.,"primrose-time"" of the previous extract from the seventh book, in which"
6759,EXCURSION.,"he tells us that after its long silence, his Muse was heard again. So"
6760,EXCURSION.,far Wordsworth's own allusions to the date of 'The Prelude.'
6761,EXCURSION.,
6762,EXCURSION.,"But there are others supplied by his own, and his sister's letters, and"
6763,EXCURSION.,also by the Grasmere Journal. In the Dove Cottage household it was
6764,EXCURSION.,"known, and talked of, as ""the Poem to Coleridge;"" and Dorothy records,"
6765,EXCURSION.,"on 11th January 1803, that her brother was working at it. On 13th"
6766,EXCURSION.,"February 1804, she writes to Mrs. Clarkson that her brother was engaged"
6767,EXCURSION.,"on a poem on his own life, and was ""going on with great rapidity."" On"
6768,EXCURSION.,"the 6th of March 1804, Wordsworth wrote from Grasmere to De Quincey,"
6769,EXCURSION.,
6770,EXCURSION.,"""I am now writing a poem on my own earlier life: I have just finished"
6771,EXCURSION.,"that part of it in which I speak of my residence at the University."""
6772,EXCURSION.,"... It is ""better than half complete, viz. four books, amounting to"
6773,EXCURSION.,"about 2500 lines.""[A]"
6774,EXCURSION.,
6775,EXCURSION.,"On the 24th of March, Dorothy wrote to Mrs. Clarkson, that since"
6776,EXCURSION.,"Coleridge left them (which was in January 1804), her brother had added"
6777,EXCURSION.,"1500 lines to the poem on his own life. On the 29th of April 1804,"
6778,EXCURSION.,"Wordsworth wrote to Richard Sharpe,"
6779,EXCURSION.,
6780,EXCURSION.,"""I have been very busy these last ten weeks: having written between"
6781,EXCURSION.,two and three thousand lines--accurately near three thousand--in that
6782,EXCURSION.,"time; namely, four books, and a third of another. I am at present at"
6783,EXCURSION.,"the Seventh Book."""
6784,EXCURSION.,
6785,EXCURSION.,"On the 25th December 1804, he wrote to Sir George Beaumont,"
6786,EXCURSION.,
6787,EXCURSION.,"""I have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks."""
6788,EXCURSION.,
6789,EXCURSION.,We thus find that Books I. to IV. had been written by the 6th of March
6790,EXCURSION.,"1804, that from the 19th February to the 29th of April nearly 3000 lines"
6791,EXCURSION.,"were written, that March and April were specially productive months, for"
6792,EXCURSION.,by the 29th April he had reached Book VII. while from 16th October to
6793,EXCURSION.,25th December he wrote over 2000 lines.
6794,EXCURSION.,
6795,EXCURSION.,Dorothy and Mary Wordsworth transcribed the earlier books more than
6796,EXCURSION.,"once, and a copy of some of them was given to Coleridge to take with him"
6797,EXCURSION.,to Malta.
6798,EXCURSION.,
6799,EXCURSION.,It is certain that the remaining books of 'The Prelude' were all written
6800,EXCURSION.,"in the spring and early summer of 1805; the seventh, eighth, ninth,"
6801,EXCURSION.,"tenth, eleventh, and part of the twelfth being finished about the middle"
6802,EXCURSION.,of April; the last 300 lines of book twelfth in the last week of April;
6803,EXCURSION.,and the two remaining books--the thirteenth and fourteenth--before the
6804,EXCURSION.,20th of May. The following extracts from letters of Wordsworth to Sir
6805,EXCURSION.,"George Beaumont make this clear, and also cast light on matters much"
6806,EXCURSION.,more important than the mere dates of composition.

6809,EXCURSION.,
6810,EXCURSION.,"""My dear Sir George,--You will be pleased to hear that I have been"
6811,EXCURSION.,advancing with my work: I have written upwards of 2000 verses during
6812,EXCURSION.,the last ten weeks. I do not know if you are exactly acquainted with
6813,EXCURSION.,"the plan of my poetical labour: It is twofold; first, a Poem, to be"
6814,EXCURSION.,called 'The Recluse;' in which it will be my object to express in
6815,EXCURSION.,"verse my most interesting feelings concerning man, nature, and"
6816,EXCURSION.,"society; and next, a poem (in which I am at present chiefly engaged)"
6817,EXCURSION.,"on _my earlier life, or the growth of my own mind,_ taken up upon a"
6818,EXCURSION.,large scale. This latter work I expect to have finished before the
6819,EXCURSION.,month of May; and then I purpose to fall with all my might on the
6820,EXCURSION.,"former, which is the chief object upon which my thoughts have been"
6821,EXCURSION.,"fixed these many years. Of this poem, that of 'The Pedlar,' which"
6822,EXCURSION.,"Coleridge read to you, is part; and I may have written of it"
6823,EXCURSION.,"altogether about 2000 lines. It will consist, I hope, of about ten or"
6824,EXCURSION.,"twelve thousand."""
6825,EXCURSION.,
6826,EXCURSION.,
6827,EXCURSION.,"GRASMERE, May 1, 1805."
6828,EXCURSION.,
6829,EXCURSION.,"""Unable to proceed with this work, [B] I turned my thoughts again to"
6830,EXCURSION.,"the 'Poem on my own Life', and you will be glad to hear that I have"
6831,EXCURSION.,added 300 lines to it in the course of last week. Two books more will
6832,EXCURSION.,"conclude it. It will not be much less than 9000 lines,--not hundred"
6833,EXCURSION.,"but thousand lines long,--an alarming length! and a thing"
6834,EXCURSION.,unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about
6835,EXCURSION.,"himself. It is not self-conceit, as you will know well, that has"
6836,EXCURSION.,"induced me to do this, but real humility. I began the work because I"
6837,EXCURSION.,"was _unprepared_ to treat _any more arduous subject_, and _diffident"
6838,EXCURSION.,"of my own powers_. Here, at least, I hoped that to a certain degree I"
6839,EXCURSION.,"should be sure of succeeding, as I had nothing to do but describe what"
6840,EXCURSION.,"I had felt and thought, and therefore could not easily be bewildered."
6841,EXCURSION.,This might have been done in narrower compass by a man of more
6842,EXCURSION.,"address; but I have done my best. If, when the work shall be finished,"
6843,EXCURSION.,"it appears to the judicious to have redundancies, they shall be lopped"
6844,EXCURSION.,"off, if possible; but this is very difficult to do, when a man has"
6845,EXCURSION.,"written with thought; and this defect, whenever I have suspected it or"
6846,EXCURSION.,"found it to exist in any writings of mine, I have always found it"
6847,EXCURSION.,"incurable. The fault lies too deep, and is in the first conception."""

6852,EXCURSION.,"""I have the pleasure to say that I _finished my poem_ about a"
6853,EXCURSION.,fortnight ago. I had looked forward to the day as a most happy one;
6854,EXCURSION.,... But it was not a happy day for me; I was dejected on many
6855,EXCURSION.,"accounts: when I looked back upon the performance, it seemed to have a"
6856,EXCURSION.,"dead weight about it,--the reality so far short of the expectation. It"
6857,EXCURSION.,was the first long labour that I had finished; and the doubt whether I
6858,EXCURSION.,"should ever live to write 'The Recluse', and the sense which I had of"
6859,EXCURSION.,"this poem being so far below what I seemed capable of executing,"
6860,EXCURSION.,"depressed me much; above all, many heavy thoughts of my poor departed"
6861,EXCURSION.,"brother hung upon me, the joy which I should have had in showing him"
6862,EXCURSION.,"the manuscript, and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams. I have"
6863,EXCURSION.,"spoken of this, because it was a state of feeling new to me, the"
6864,EXCURSION.,occasion being new. This work may be considered as a sort of _portico_
6865,EXCURSION.,"to 'The Recluse', part of the same building, which I hope to be able,"
6866,EXCURSION.,"ere long, to begin with in earnest; and if I am permitted to bring it"
6867,EXCURSION.,"to a conclusion, and to write, further, a narrative poem of the epic"
6868,EXCURSION.,"kind, I shall consider the task of my life as over. I ought to add,"
6869,EXCURSION.,that I have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of
6870,EXCURSION.,"so alarming a length as I apprehended."""
6871,EXCURSION.,
6872,EXCURSION.,
6873,EXCURSION.,These letters explain the delay in the publication of 'The Prelude'.
6874,EXCURSION.,They show that what led Wordsworth to write so much about himself was
6875,EXCURSION.,"not self-conceit, but self-diffidence. He felt unprepared as yet for the"
6876,EXCURSION.,more arduous task he had set before himself. He saw its faults as
6877,EXCURSION.,"clearly, or more clearly, than the critics who condemned him. He knew"
6878,EXCURSION.,that its length was excessive. He tried to condense it; he kept it
6879,EXCURSION.,"beside him unpublished, and occasionally revised it, with a view to"
6880,EXCURSION.,"condensation, in vain. The text received his final corrections in the"
6881,EXCURSION.,year 1832.
6882,EXCURSION.,
6883,EXCURSION.,"Wordsworth's reluctance to publish these portions of his great poem,"
6884,EXCURSION.,"'The Recluse', other than 'The Excursion', during his lifetime, was a"
6885,EXCURSION.,"matter of surprise to his friends; to whom he, or the ladies of his"
6886,EXCURSION.,"household, had read portions of it. In the year 1819, Charles Lamb wrote"
6887,EXCURSION.,"to him,"
6888,EXCURSION.,
6889,EXCURSION.,"""If, as you say, 'The Waggoner', in some sort, came at my call, oh for"

6902,EXCURSION.,
6903,EXCURSION.,The actual result--in the Poem he had at length committed to
6904,EXCURSION.,"writing--was so far inferior to the ideal he had tried to realise, that"
6905,EXCURSION.,he could never be induced to publish it. He spoke of the MS. as forming
6906,EXCURSION.,"a sort of _portico_ to his larger work--the poem on Man, Nature, and"
6907,EXCURSION.,"Society--which he meant to call 'The Recluse', and of which one portion"
6908,EXCURSION.,"only, _viz._ 'The Excursion', was finished. It is clear that throughout"
6909,EXCURSION.,"the composition of 'The Prelude', he felt that he was experimenting with"
6910,EXCURSION.,"his powers. He wished to find out whether he could construct ""a literary"
6911,EXCURSION.,"work that might live,"" on a larger scale than his Lyrics; and it was on"
6912,EXCURSION.,"the writing of a ""philosophical poem,"" dealing with Man and Nature, in"
6913,EXCURSION.,"their deepest aspects, that his thoughts had been fixed for many years."
6914,EXCURSION.,"From the letter to Sir George Beaumont, December 25, 1804, it is evident"
6915,EXCURSION.,that he regarded the autobiographical poem as a mere prologue to this
6916,EXCURSION.,"larger work, to which he hoped to turn ""with all his might"" after 'The"
6917,EXCURSION.,"Prelude' was finished, and of which he had already written about a fifth"
6918,EXCURSION.,"or a sixth (see 'Memoirs', vol. i. p. 304). This was the part known in"
6919,EXCURSION.,"the Grasmere household as ""The Pedlar,"" a title given to it from the"
6920,EXCURSION.,"character of the Wanderer, but afterwards happily set aside. He did not"
6921,EXCURSION.,"devote himself, however, to the completion of his wider purpose,"
6922,EXCURSION.,immediately after 'The Prelude' was finished. He wrote one book of 'The
6923,EXCURSION.,"Recluse' which he called ""Home at Grasmere""; and, though detached from"
6924,EXCURSION.,"'The Prelude', it is a continuation of the narrative of his own life at"
6925,EXCURSION.,the point where it is left off in the latter poem. It consists of 733
6926,EXCURSION.,lines. Two extracts from it were published in the 'Memoirs of
6927,EXCURSION.,"Wordsworth' in 1851 (vol. i. pp. 151 and 155), beginning,"
6928,EXCURSION.,
6929,EXCURSION.,"'On Nature's invitation do I come,'"
6930,EXCURSION.,
6931,EXCURSION.,and
6932,EXCURSION.,
6933,EXCURSION.,"'Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak.'"
6934,EXCURSION.,
6935,EXCURSION.,"These will be found in vol. ii. of this edition, pp. 118 and 121"
6936,EXCURSION.,respectively.
6937,EXCURSION.,
6938,EXCURSION.,"The autobiographical poem remained, as already stated, during"
6939,EXCURSION.,Wordsworth's lifetime without a title. The name finally adopted--'The
6940,EXCURSION.,"Prelude'--was suggested by Mrs. Wordsworth, both to indicate its"
6941,EXCURSION.,"relation to the larger work, and the fact of its having been written"
6942,EXCURSION.,comparatively early.
6943,EXCURSION.,
6944,EXCURSION.,"As the poem was addressed to Coleridge, it may be desirable to add in"
6945,EXCURSION.,this place his critical verdict upon it; along with the poem which he
6946,EXCURSION.,"wrote, on hearing Wordsworth read a portion of it to him, in the winter"
6947,EXCURSION.,"of 1806, at Coleorton."
6948,EXCURSION.,
6949,EXCURSION.,"In his 'Table Talk' (London, 1835, vol. ii. p. 70), Coleridge's opinion"
6950,EXCURSION.,is recorded thus:
6951,EXCURSION.,
6952,EXCURSION.,"""I cannot help regretting that Wordsworth did not first publish his"
6953,EXCURSION.,thirteen (fourteen) books on the growth of an individual
6954,EXCURSION.,"mind--superior, as I used to think, upon the whole to 'The Excursion'."
6955,EXCURSION.,You may judge how I felt about them by my own Poem upon the occasion.
6956,EXCURSION.,"Then the plan laid out, and, I believe, partly suggested by me, was,"
6957,EXCURSION.,"that Wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose,"
6958,EXCURSION.,"one whose principles were made up, and so prepared to deliver upon"
6959,EXCURSION.,"authority a system of philosophy. He was to treat man as man,--a"
6960,EXCURSION.,"subject of eye, ear, touch, and taste in contact with external nature,"
6961,EXCURSION.,"and informing the senses from the mind, and not compounding a mind out"
6962,EXCURSION.,of the senses; then he was to describe the pastoral and other states
6963,EXCURSION.,"of society, assuming something of the Juvenalian spirit as he"
6964,EXCURSION.,"approached the high civilisation of cities and towns, and opening a"
6965,EXCURSION.,melancholy picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice; thence
6966,EXCURSION.,"he was to infer and reveal the proof of, and necessity for, the whole"
6967,EXCURSION.,"state of man and society being subject to, and illustrative of a"
6968,EXCURSION.,"redemptive process in operation, showing how this idea reconciled all"
6969,EXCURSION.,"the anomalies, and promised future glory and restoration. Something of"
6970,EXCURSION.,"this sort was, I think, agreed on. It is, in substance, what I have"
6971,EXCURSION.,been all my life doing in my system of philosophy.
6972,EXCURSION.,
6973,EXCURSION.,"""I think Wordsworth possessed more of the genius of a great"
6974,EXCURSION.,"Philosopher than any man I ever knew, or, as I believe, has existed in"
6975,EXCURSION.,England since Milton; but it seems to me that he ought never to have
6976,EXCURSION.,"abandoned the contemplative position which is peculiarly--perhaps, I"
6977,EXCURSION.,might say exclusively--fitted for him. His proper title is 'Spectator

6996,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,By vital breathings secret as the soul
6997,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of vernal growth, oft quickens in the heart"
6998,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,Thoughts all too deep for words!--

7007,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"The Light reflected, as a light bestowed--"
7008,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of fancies fair, and milder hours of youth,"
7009,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,Hyblean murmurs of poetic thought
7010,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Industrious in its joy, in vales and glens,"
7011,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Native or outland, lakes and famous hills!"
7012,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Or on the lonely high-road, when the stars"
7013,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Were rising; or by secret mountain-streams,"
7014,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,The guides and the companions of thy way!
7015,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of more than Fancy, of the Social Sense"
7016,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Distending wide, and man beloved as man,"
7017,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,Where France in all her towns lay vibrating
7018,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,Like some becalmed bark beneath the burst
7019,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of Heaven's immediate thunder, when no cloud"
7020,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Is visible, or shadow on the main."
7021,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"For thou wert there, thine own brows garlanded,"
7022,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Amid the tremor of a realm aglow,"
7023,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Amid a mighty nation jubilant,"
7024,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,When from the general heart of humankind
7025,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,Hope sprang forth like a full-born Deity!
7026,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"--Of that dear Hope afflicted and struck down,"
7027,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"So summoned homeward, thenceforth calm and sure,"
7028,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"From the dread watch-tower of man's absolute self,"
7029,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"With light unwaning on her eyes, to look"
7030,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,Far on--herself a glory to behold.
7031,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,The Angel of the vision! Then (last strain)
7032,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of Duty, chosen laws controlling choice,"
7033,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Action and joy!--An Orphic song indeed,"
7034,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,A song divine of high and passionate thoughts

7036,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,O great Bard!
7037,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Ere yet that last strain dying awed the air,"
7038,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,With stedfast eye I viewed thee in the choir
7039,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,Of ever-enduring men. The truly great
7040,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Have all one age, and from one visible space"
7041,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Shed influence! They, both in power and act,"
7042,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Are permanent, and Time is not with them,"
7043,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Save as it worketh for them, they in it."
7044,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Nor less a sacred roll, than those of old,"
7045,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And to be placed, as they, with gradual fame"
7046,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Among the archives of mankind, thy work"
7047,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Makes audible a linked lay of Truth,"
7048,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of Truth profound a sweet continuous lay,"
7049,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Not learnt, but native, her own natural notes!"
7050,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Ah! as I listened with a heart forlorn,"
7051,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,The pulses of my being beat anew:
7052,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And even as life returns upon the drowned,"
7053,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,Life's joy rekindling roused a throng of pains--
7054,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Keen pangs of Love, awakening as a babe"
7055,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Turbulent, with an outcry in the heart;"
7056,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And fears self-willed, that shunned the eye of hope;"
7057,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,And hope that scarce would know itself from fear;
7058,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Sense of past youth, and manhood come in vain,"
7059,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And genius given, and knowledge won in vain;"
7060,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And all which I had culled in wood-walks wild,"
7061,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And all which patient toil had reared, and all,"
7062,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,Commune with thee had opened out--but flowers
7063,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Strewed on my corse, and borne upon my bier,"
7064,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"In the same coffin, for the self-same grave!"
7065,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,
7066,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"...   Eve following eve,"
7067,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of Home"
7068,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Is sweetest! moments for their own sake hailed,"
7069,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And more desired, more precious for thy song,"
7070,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"In silence listening, like a devout child,"
7071,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"My soul lay passive, by thy various strain"
7072,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Driven as in surges now beneath the stars,"
7073,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"With momentary stars of my own birth,"
7074,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Fair constellated foam, [C] still darting off"
7075,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Into the darkness; now a tranquil sea,"
7076,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the moon."
7077,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,
7078,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,And when--O Friend! my comforter and guide!
7079,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Strong in thyself, and powerful to give strength!--"
7080,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Thy long-sustained Song finally closed,"
7081,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,And thy deep voice had ceased--yet thou thyself
7082,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Wert still before my eyes, and round us both"
7083,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,That happy vision of beloved faces--
7084,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Scarce conscious, and yet conscious of its close"
7085,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"I sate, my being blended in one thought"
7086,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,(Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?)
7087,AN INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound--"

7210,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,So fair; and while upon the fancied scene

7220,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"From that soft couch I rose not, till the sun"

7224,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Keen as a Truant or a Fugitive,                                     90"

7228,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"It was a splendid evening, and my soul"

7248,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,But speedily an earnest longing rose
7249,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"To brace myself to some determined aim,                            115"
7250,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Reading or thinking; either to lay up
7251,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"New stores, or rescue from decay the old"
7252,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,By timely interference: and therewith
7253,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Came hopes still higher, that with outward life"

7263,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Would gladly grapple with some noble theme,"
7264,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Vain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds                     130
7265,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Impediments from day to day renewed.
7266,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,
7267,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,And now it would content me to yield up
7268,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Those lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts"

7497,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,
7498,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,One summer evening (led by her) I found
7499,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,A little boat tied to a willow tree
7500,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Within a rocky cave, [e] its usual home."
7501,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Straight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in                      360"
7502,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Pushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth
7503,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"And troubled pleasure, nor without the voice"
7504,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Of mountain-echoes did my boat move on;
7505,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Leaving behind her still, on either side,"
7506,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Small circles glittering idly in the moon,                          365"
7507,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Until they melted all into one track
7508,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Of sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,"
7509,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Proud of his skill, to reach a chosen point"
7510,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"With an unswerving line, I fixed my view"
7511,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Upon the summit of a craggy ridge,                                  370"
7512,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,The horizon's utmost boundary; far above
7513,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.
7514,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,She was an elfin pinnace; lustily
7515,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"I dipped my oars into the silent lake,"
7516,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"And, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat                             375"
7517,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Went heaving through the water like a swan;
7518,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"When, from behind that craggy steep till then"
7519,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"The horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,"
7520,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,As if with voluntary power instinct
7521,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Upreared its head. [f] I struck and struck again,                   380"
7522,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,And growing still in stature the grim shape
7523,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Towered up between me and the stars, and still,"
7524,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"For so it seemed, with purpose of its own"
7525,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"And measured motion like a living thing,"
7526,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Strode after me. With trembling oars I turned,                      385"
7527,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,And through the silent water stole my way
7528,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Back to the covert of the willow tree;
7529,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"There in her mooring-place I left my bark,--"
7530,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"And through the meadows homeward went, in grave"
7531,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,And serious mood; but after I had seen                              390
7532,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"That spectacle, for many days, my brain"

7536,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,Or blank desertion. No familiar shapes                              395
7537,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Remained, no pleasant images of trees,"
7538,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;"

7544,INTRODUCTION.--CHILDHOOD AND SCHOOL-TIME,"Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought,"

8154,BOOK SECOND,
8155,BOOK SECOND,
8156,BOOK SECOND,"Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much"
8157,BOOK SECOND,"Unvisited, endeavoured to retrace"
8158,BOOK SECOND,The simple ways in which my childhood walked;
8159,BOOK SECOND,Those chiefly that first led me to the love
8160,BOOK SECOND,"Of rivers, woods, and fields. The passion yet                        5"
8161,BOOK SECOND,"Was in its birth, sustained as might befal"
8162,BOOK SECOND,By nourishment that came unsought; for still
8163,BOOK SECOND,"From week to week, from month to month, we lived"
8164,BOOK SECOND,A round of tumult. Duly were our games
8165,BOOK SECOND,Prolonged in summer till the day-light failed:                      10
8166,BOOK SECOND,No chair remained before the doors; the bench
8167,BOOK SECOND,And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep
8168,BOOK SECOND,"The labourer, and the old man who had sate"
8169,BOOK SECOND,A later lingerer; yet the revelry
8170,BOOK SECOND,"Continued and the loud uproar: at last,                             15"
8171,BOOK SECOND,"When all the ground was dark, and twinkling stars"
8172,BOOK SECOND,"Edged the black clouds, home and to bed we went,"
8173,BOOK SECOND,Feverish with weary joints and beating minds.
8174,BOOK SECOND,"Ah! is there one who ever has been young,"
8175,BOOK SECOND,Nor needs a warning voice to tame the pride                         20
8176,BOOK SECOND,Of intellect and virtue's self-esteem?
8177,BOOK SECOND,"One is there, though the wisest and the best"
8178,BOOK SECOND,"Of all mankind, who covets not at times"
8179,BOOK SECOND,"Union that cannot be;--who would not give,"
8180,BOOK SECOND,"If so he might, to duty and to truth                                25"
8181,BOOK SECOND,The eagerness of infantine desire?
8182,BOOK SECOND,A tranquillising spirit presses now
8183,BOOK SECOND,"On my corporeal frame, so wide appears"
8184,BOOK SECOND,The vacancy between me and those days
8185,BOOK SECOND,"Which yet have such self-presence in my mind,                       30"
8186,BOOK SECOND,"That, musing on them, often do I seem"
8187,BOOK SECOND,"Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself"
8188,BOOK SECOND,And of some other Being. A rude mass
8189,BOOK SECOND,"Of native rock, left midway in the square"
8190,BOOK SECOND,"Of our small market village, was the goal                           35"
8191,BOOK SECOND,"Or centre of these sports; [A] and when, returned"
8192,BOOK SECOND,"After long absence, thither I repaired,"
8193,BOOK SECOND,"Gone was the old grey stone, and in its place"
8194,BOOK SECOND,A smart Assembly-room usurped the ground
8195,BOOK SECOND,"That had been ours. There let the fiddle scream,                    40"
8196,BOOK SECOND,"And be ye happy! Yet, my Friends! I know"
8197,BOOK SECOND,That more than one of you will think with me
8198,BOOK SECOND,"Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame"
8199,BOOK SECOND,"From whom the stone was named, who there had sate,"
8200,BOOK SECOND,And watched her table with its huckster's wares                     45
8201,BOOK SECOND,"Assiduous, through the length of sixty years."
8202,BOOK SECOND,
8203,BOOK SECOND,We ran a boisterous course; the year span round
8204,BOOK SECOND,With giddy motion. But the time approached
8205,BOOK SECOND,That brought with it a regular desire
8206,BOOK SECOND,"For calmer pleasures, when the winning forms                        50"
8207,BOOK SECOND,Of Nature were collaterally attached
8208,BOOK SECOND,To every scheme of holiday delight
8209,BOOK SECOND,"And every boyish sport, less grateful else"
8210,BOOK SECOND,And languidly pursued.
8211,BOOK SECOND,"When summer came,"
8212,BOOK SECOND,"Our pastime was, on bright half-holidays,                           55"
8213,BOOK SECOND,"To sweep, along the plain of Windermere"
8214,BOOK SECOND,With rival oars; [B] and the selected bourne
8215,BOOK SECOND,Was now an Island musical with birds
8216,BOOK SECOND,That sang and ceased not; now a Sister Isle
8217,BOOK SECOND,"Beneath the oaks' umbrageous covert, sown                           60"
8218,BOOK SECOND,With lilies of the valley like a field; [C]
8219,BOOK SECOND,"And now a third small Island, where survived"
8220,BOOK SECOND,In solitude the ruins of a shrine
8221,BOOK SECOND,"Once to Our Lady dedicate, and served"
8222,BOOK SECOND,Daily with chaunted rites. [D] In such a race                       65
8223,BOOK SECOND,"So ended, disappointment could be none,"
8224,BOOK SECOND,"Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:"
8225,BOOK SECOND,"We rested in the shade, all pleased alike,"
8226,BOOK SECOND,"Conquered and conqueror. Thus the pride of strength,"
8227,BOOK SECOND,"And the vain-glory of superior skill,                               70"
8228,BOOK SECOND,Were tempered; thus was gradually produced
8229,BOOK SECOND,A quiet independence of the heart;
8230,BOOK SECOND,"And to my Friend who knows me I may add,"
8231,BOOK SECOND,"Fearless of blame, that hence for future days"
8232,BOOK SECOND,"Ensued a diffidence and modesty,                                    75"
8233,BOOK SECOND,"And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,"
8234,BOOK SECOND,The self-sufficing power of Solitude.
8235,BOOK SECOND,
8236,BOOK SECOND,"Our daily meals were frugal, Sabine fare!"
8237,BOOK SECOND,More than we wished we knew the blessing then
8238,BOOK SECOND,Of vigorous hunger--hence corporeal strength                        80
8239,BOOK SECOND,"Unsapped by delicate viands; for, exclude"
8240,BOOK SECOND,"A little weekly stipend, and we lived"
8241,BOOK SECOND,Through three divisions of the quartered year
8242,BOOK SECOND,In penniless poverty. But now to school
8243,BOOK SECOND,"From the half-yearly holidays returned,                             85"
8244,BOOK SECOND,"We came with weightier purses, that sufficed"
8245,BOOK SECOND,To furnish treats more costly than the Dame
8246,BOOK SECOND,"Of the old grey stone, from her scant board, supplied."
8247,BOOK SECOND,"Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,"
8248,BOOK SECOND,"Or in the woods, or by a river side                                 90"
8249,BOOK SECOND,"Or shady fountains, while among the leaves"
8250,BOOK SECOND,"Soft airs were stirring, and the mid-day sun"
8251,BOOK SECOND,Unfelt shone brightly round us in our joy.
8252,BOOK SECOND,Nor is my aim neglected if I tell
8253,BOOK SECOND,"How sometimes, in the length of those half-years,                   95"
8254,BOOK SECOND,"We from our funds drew largely;--proud to curb,"
8255,BOOK SECOND,"And eager to spur on, the galloping steed;"
8256,BOOK SECOND,"And with the courteous inn-keeper, whose stud"
8257,BOOK SECOND,"Supplied our want, we haply might employ"
8258,BOOK SECOND,"Sly subterfuge, if the adventure's bound                           100"
8259,BOOK SECOND,Were distant: some famed temple where of yore
8260,BOOK SECOND,"The Druids worshipped, [E] or the antique walls"
8261,BOOK SECOND,"Of that large abbey, where within the Vale"
8262,BOOK SECOND,"Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built, [F]"
8263,BOOK SECOND,"Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch,                  105"
8264,BOOK SECOND,"Belfry, [G] and images, and living trees,"
8265,BOOK SECOND,A holy scene! Along the smooth green turf
8266,BOOK SECOND,Our horses grazed. To more than inland peace
8267,BOOK SECOND,Left by the west wind sweeping overhead
8268,BOOK SECOND,"From a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers                          110"
8269,BOOK SECOND,"In that sequestered valley may be seen,"
8270,BOOK SECOND,Both silent and both motionless alike;
8271,BOOK SECOND,"Such the deep shelter that is there, and such"
8272,BOOK SECOND,The safeguard for repose and quietness.
8273,BOOK SECOND,
8274,BOOK SECOND,"Our steeds remounted and the summons given,                      115"
8275,BOOK SECOND,With whip and spur we through the chauntry flew
8276,BOOK SECOND,"In uncouth race, and left the cross-legged knight,"
8277,BOOK SECOND,"And the stone-abbot, [H] and that single wren"
8278,BOOK SECOND,Which one day sang so sweetly in the nave
8279,BOOK SECOND,"Of the old church, that--though from recent showers                120"
8280,BOOK SECOND,"The earth was comfortless, and touched by faint"
8281,BOOK SECOND,"Internal breezes, sobbings of the place"
8282,BOOK SECOND,"And respirations, from the roofless walls"
8283,BOOK SECOND,The shuddering ivy dripped large drops--yet still
8284,BOOK SECOND,So sweetly 'mid the gloom the invisible bird                       125
8285,BOOK SECOND,"Sang to herself, that there I could have made"
8286,BOOK SECOND,"My dwelling-place, and lived for ever there"
8287,BOOK SECOND,To hear such music. Through the walls we flew
8288,BOOK SECOND,"And down the valley, and, a circuit made"
8289,BOOK SECOND,"In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth                   130"
8290,BOOK SECOND,"We scampered homewards. Oh, ye rocks and streams,"
8291,BOOK SECOND,And that still spirit shed from evening air!
8292,BOOK SECOND,Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt
8293,BOOK SECOND,"Your presence, when with slackened step we breathed"
8294,BOOK SECOND,"Along the sides of the steep hills, or when                        135"
8295,BOOK SECOND,Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea
8296,BOOK SECOND,We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.
8297,BOOK SECOND,
8298,BOOK SECOND,"Midway on long Winander's eastern shore,"
8299,BOOK SECOND,"Within the crescent of a pleasant bay, [I]"
8300,BOOK SECOND,"A tavern stood; [K] no homely-featured house,                      140"
8301,BOOK SECOND,"Primeval like its neighbouring cottages,"
8302,BOOK SECOND,"But 'twas a splendid place, the door beset"
8303,BOOK SECOND,"With chaises, grooms, and liveries, and within"
8304,BOOK SECOND,"Decanters, glasses, and the blood-red wine."
8305,BOOK SECOND,"In ancient times, and ere the Hall was built                       145"
8306,BOOK SECOND,"On the large island, had this dwelling been"
8307,BOOK SECOND,"More worthy of a poet's love, a hut,"
8308,BOOK SECOND,Proud of its own bright fire and sycamore shade.
8309,BOOK SECOND,But--though the rhymes were gone that once inscribed
8310,BOOK SECOND,"The threshold, and large golden characters,                        150"
8311,BOOK SECOND,"Spread o'er the spangled sign-board, had dislodged"
8312,BOOK SECOND,"The old Lion and usurped his place, in slight"
8313,BOOK SECOND,And mockery of the rustic painter's hand--[L]
8314,BOOK SECOND,"Yet, to this hour, the spot to me is dear"
8315,BOOK SECOND,With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay                          155
8316,BOOK SECOND,Upon a slope surmounted by a plain
8317,BOOK SECOND,Of a small bowling-green; beneath us stood
8318,BOOK SECOND,"A grove, with gleams of water through the trees"
8319,BOOK SECOND,And over the tree-tops; [M] nor did we want
8320,BOOK SECOND,"Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.                        160"
8321,BOOK SECOND,"There, while through half an afternoon we played"
8322,BOOK SECOND,"On the smooth platform, whether skill prevailed"
8323,BOOK SECOND,"Or happy blunder triumphed, bursts of glee"
8324,BOOK SECOND,"Made all the mountains ring. But, ere night-fall,"
8325,BOOK SECOND,When in our pinnace we returned at leisure                         165
8326,BOOK SECOND,"Over the shadowy lake, and to the beach"
8327,BOOK SECOND,"Of some small island steered our course with one,"
8328,BOOK SECOND,"The Minstrel of the Troop, and left him there, [N]"
8329,BOOK SECOND,"And rowed off gently, while he blew his flute"
8330,BOOK SECOND,"Alone upon the rock--oh, then, the calm                            170"
8331,BOOK SECOND,And dead still water lay upon my mind
8332,BOOK SECOND,"Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky,"
8333,BOOK SECOND,"Never before so beautiful, sank down"
8334,BOOK SECOND,"Into my heart, and held me like a dream!"
8335,BOOK SECOND,"Thus were my sympathies enlarged, and thus                         175"
8336,BOOK SECOND,Daily the common range of visible things
8337,BOOK SECOND,Grew dear to me: already I began
8338,BOOK SECOND,"To love the sun; a boy I loved the sun,"
8339,BOOK SECOND,"Not as I since have loved him, as a pledge"
8340,BOOK SECOND,"And surety of our earthly life, a light                            180"
8341,BOOK SECOND,Which we behold and feel we are alive; [O]
8342,BOOK SECOND,Nor for his bounty to so many worlds--
8343,BOOK SECOND,"But for this cause, that I had seen him lay"
8344,BOOK SECOND,"His beauty on the morning hills, had seen"
8345,BOOK SECOND,"The western mountain [P] touch his setting orb,                    185"
8346,BOOK SECOND,"In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess"
8347,BOOK SECOND,"Of happiness, my blood appeared to flow"
8348,BOOK SECOND,"For its own pleasure, and I breathed with joy."
8349,BOOK SECOND,"And, from like feelings, humble though intense,"
8350,BOOK SECOND,To patriotic and domestic love                                     190
8351,BOOK SECOND,"Analogous, the moon to me was dear;"
8352,BOOK SECOND,"For I could dream away my purposes,"
8353,BOOK SECOND,Standing to gaze upon her while she hung
8354,BOOK SECOND,"Midway between the hills, as if she knew"
8355,BOOK SECOND,"No other region, but belonged to thee, [Q]                         195"
8356,BOOK SECOND,"Yea, appertained by a peculiar right"
8357,BOOK SECOND,"To thee and thy grey huts, thou one dear Vale! [R]"
8358,BOOK SECOND,
8359,BOOK SECOND,Those incidental charms which first attached
8360,BOOK SECOND,"My heart to rural objects, day by day"
8361,BOOK SECOND,"Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell                               200"
8362,BOOK SECOND,"How Nature, intervenient till this time"
8363,BOOK SECOND,"And secondary, now at length was sought"
8364,BOOK SECOND,For her own sake. But who shall parcel out
8365,BOOK SECOND,"His intellect by geometric rules,"
8366,BOOK SECOND,Split like a province into round and square?                       205
8367,BOOK SECOND,Who knows the individual hour in which
8368,BOOK SECOND,"His habits were first sown, even as a seed?"
8369,BOOK SECOND,Who that shall point as with a wand and say
8370,BOOK SECOND,"""This portion of the river of my mind"
8371,BOOK SECOND,"Came from yon fountain?"" [S] Thou, my Friend! art one              210"
8372,BOOK SECOND,More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee
8373,BOOK SECOND,"Science appears but what in truth she is,"
8374,BOOK SECOND,"Not as our glory and our absolute boast,"
8375,BOOK SECOND,"But as a succedaneum, and a prop"
8376,BOOK SECOND,To our infirmity. No officious slave                               215
8377,BOOK SECOND,Art thou of that false secondary power
8378,BOOK SECOND,"By which we multiply distinctions; then,"
8379,BOOK SECOND,Deem that our puny boundaries are things
8380,BOOK SECOND,"That we perceive, and not that we have made."
8381,BOOK SECOND,"To thee, unblinded by these formal arts,                           220"
8382,BOOK SECOND,"The unity of all hath been revealed,"
8383,BOOK SECOND,"And thou wilt doubt, with me less aptly skilled"
8384,BOOK SECOND,Than many are to range the faculties
8385,BOOK SECOND,"In scale and order, class the cabinet"
8386,BOOK SECOND,"Of their sensations, and in voluble phrase                         225"
8387,BOOK SECOND,Run through the history and birth of each
8388,BOOK SECOND,As of a single independent thing.
8389,BOOK SECOND,"Hard task, vain hope, to analyse the mind,"
8390,BOOK SECOND,"If each most obvious and particular thought,"
8391,BOOK SECOND,"Not in a mystical and idle sense,                                  230"
8392,BOOK SECOND,"But in the words of Reason deeply weighed,"
8393,BOOK SECOND,Hath no beginning.
8394,BOOK SECOND,"Blest the infant Babe,"
8395,BOOK SECOND,(For with my best conjecture I would trace
8396,BOOK SECOND,"Our Being's earthly progress,) blest the Babe,"
8397,BOOK SECOND,"Nursed in his Mother's arms, who sinks to sleep                    235"
8398,BOOK SECOND,Rocked on his Mother's breast; who with his soul
8399,BOOK SECOND,Drinks in the feelings of his Mother's eye!
8400,BOOK SECOND,"For him, in one dear Presence, there exists"
8401,BOOK SECOND,A virtue which irradiates and exalts
8402,BOOK SECOND,Objects through widest intercourse of sense.                       240
8403,BOOK SECOND,"No outcast he, bewildered and depressed:"
8404,BOOK SECOND,Along his infant veins are interfused
8405,BOOK SECOND,The gravitation and the filial bond
8406,BOOK SECOND,Of nature that connect him with the world.
8407,BOOK SECOND,"Is there a flower, to which he points with hand                    245"
8408,BOOK SECOND,"Too weak to gather it, already love"
8409,BOOK SECOND,Drawn from love's purest earthly fount for him
8410,BOOK SECOND,Hath beautified that flower; already shades
8411,BOOK SECOND,Of pity cast from inward tenderness
8412,BOOK SECOND,Do fall around him upon aught that bears                           250
8413,BOOK SECOND,Unsightly marks of violence or harm.
8414,BOOK SECOND,"Emphatically such a Being lives,"
8415,BOOK SECOND,"Frail creature as he is, helpless as frail,"
8416,BOOK SECOND,An inmate of this active universe.
8417,BOOK SECOND,For feeling has to him imparted power                              255
8418,BOOK SECOND,That through the growing faculties of sense
8419,BOOK SECOND,Doth like an agent of the one great Mind
8420,BOOK SECOND,"Create, creator and receiver both,"
8421,BOOK SECOND,Working but in alliance with the works
8422,BOOK SECOND,"Which it beholds. Such, verily, is the first                       260"
8423,BOOK SECOND,"Poetic spirit of our human life,"
8424,BOOK SECOND,"By uniform control of after years,"
8425,BOOK SECOND,"In most, abated or suppressed; in some,"
8426,BOOK SECOND,"Through every change of growth and of decay,"
8427,BOOK SECOND,Pre-eminent till death.
8428,BOOK SECOND,
8429,BOOK SECOND,"From early days,                            265"
8430,BOOK SECOND,Beginning not long after that first time
8431,BOOK SECOND,"In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch"
8432,BOOK SECOND,"I held mute dialogues with my Mother's heart,"
8433,BOOK SECOND,I have endeavoured to display the means
8434,BOOK SECOND,"Whereby this infant sensibility,                                   270"
8435,BOOK SECOND,"Great birthright of our being, was in me"
8436,BOOK SECOND,Augmented and sustained. Yet is a path
8437,BOOK SECOND,More difficult before me; and I fear
8438,BOOK SECOND,That in its broken windings we shall need
8439,BOOK SECOND,"The chamois' sinews, and the eagle's wing:                         275"
8440,BOOK SECOND,For now a trouble came into my mind
8441,BOOK SECOND,From unknown causes. I was left alone
8442,BOOK SECOND,"Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why."
8443,BOOK SECOND,"The props of my affections were removed,"
8444,BOOK SECOND,"And yet the building stood, as if sustained                        280"
8445,BOOK SECOND,By its own spirit! All that I beheld
8446,BOOK SECOND,"Was dear, and hence to finer influxes"
8447,BOOK SECOND,The mind lay open to a more exact
8448,BOOK SECOND,And close communion. Many are our joys
8449,BOOK SECOND,"In youth, but oh! what happiness to live                           285"
8450,BOOK SECOND,When every hour brings palpable access
8451,BOOK SECOND,"Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,"
8452,BOOK SECOND,"And sorrow is not there! The seasons came,"
8453,BOOK SECOND,And every season wheresoe'er I moved
8454,BOOK SECOND,"Unfolded transitory qualities,                                     290"
8455,BOOK SECOND,"Which, but for this most watchful power of love,"
8456,BOOK SECOND,Had been neglected; left a register
8457,BOOK SECOND,"Of permanent relations, else unknown."
8458,BOOK SECOND,"Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude"
8459,BOOK SECOND,"More active even than ""best society""--[T]                          295"
8460,BOOK SECOND,Society made sweet as solitude
8461,BOOK SECOND,By silent inobtrusive sympathies--

8829,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
8830,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
8831,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,It was a dreary morning when the wheels
8832,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Rolled over a wide plain o'erhung with clouds,"
8833,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And nothing cheered our way till first we saw
8834,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The long-roofed chapel of King's College lift
8835,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Turrets and pinnacles in answering files,                            5"
8836,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Extended high above a dusky grove, [A]"
8837,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
8838,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Advancing, we espied upon the road"
8839,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A student clothed in gown and tasselled cap,"
8840,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Striding along as if o'ertasked by Time,"
8841,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Or covetous of exercise and air;                                    10
8842,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,He passed--nor was I master of my eyes
8843,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Till he was left an arrow's flight behind.
8844,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"As near and nearer to the spot we drew,"
8845,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,It seemed to suck us in with an eddy's force.
8846,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Onward we drove beneath the Castle; caught,                         15"
8847,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"While crossing Magdalene Bridge, a glimpse of Cam;"
8848,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And at the 'Hoop' alighted, famous Inn. [B]"
8849,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
8850,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"My spirit was up, my thoughts were full of hope;"
8851,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Some friends I had, acquaintances who there"
8852,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Seemed friends, poor simple school-boys, now hung round             20"
8853,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,With honour and importance: in a world
8854,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of welcome faces up and down I roved;
8855,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Questions, directions, warnings and advice,"
8856,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Flowed in upon me, from all sides; fresh day"
8857,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of pride and pleasure! to myself I seemed                           25
8858,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A man of business and expense, and went"
8859,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"From shop to shop about my own affairs,"
8860,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To Tutor or to Tailor, as befel,"
8861,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,From street to street with loose and careless mind.
8862,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
8863,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I was the Dreamer, they the Dream; I roamed                       30"
8864,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Delighted through the motley spectacle;
8865,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Gowns, grave, or gaudy, doctors, students, streets,"
8866,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Courts, cloisters, flocks of churches, gateways, towers:"
8867,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Migration strange for a stripling of the hills,"
8868,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,A northern villager.
8869,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,As if the change                             35
8870,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Had waited on some Fairy's wand, at once"
8871,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Behold me rich in monies, and attired"
8872,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In splendid garb, with hose of silk, and hair"
8873,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Powdered like rimy trees, when frost is keen."
8874,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"My lordly dressing-gown, I pass it by,                              40"
8875,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,With other signs of manhood that supplied
8876,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"The lack of beard.--The weeks went roundly on,"
8877,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"With invitations, suppers, wine and fruit,"
8878,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Smooth housekeeping within, and all without"
8879,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Liberal, and suiting gentleman's array.                             45"
8880,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
8881,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The Evangelist St. John my patron was:
8882,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Three Gothic courts are his, and in the first"
8883,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Was my abiding-place, a nook obscure; [C]"
8884,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Right underneath, the College kitchens made"
8885,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A humming sound, less tuneable than bees,                           50"
8886,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,But hardly less industrious; with shrill notes
8887,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of sharp command and scolding intermixed.
8888,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Near me hung Trinity's loquacious clock,"
8889,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Who never let the quarters, night or day,"
8890,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Slip by him unproclaimed, and told the hours                        55"
8891,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Twice over with a male and female voice.
8892,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Her pealing organ was my neighbour too;
8893,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And from my pillow, looking forth by light"
8894,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold"
8895,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The antechapel where the statue stood                               60
8896,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of Newton with his prism and silent face,"
8897,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The marble index of a mind for ever
8898,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone."
8899,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
8900,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of College labours, of the Lecturer's room"
8901,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"All studded round, as thick as chairs could stand,                  65"
8902,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"With loyal students faithful to their books,"
8903,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Half-and-half idlers, hardy recusants,"
8904,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And honest dunces--of important days,"
8905,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Examinations, when the man was weighed"
8906,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"As in a balance! of excessive hopes,                                70"
8907,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Tremblings withal and commendable fears,"
8908,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Small jealousies, and triumphs good or bad,"
8909,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Let others that know more speak as they know.
8910,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Such glory was but little sought by me,"
8911,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And little won. Yet from the first crude days                       75
8912,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of settling time in this untried abode,"
8913,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I was disturbed at times by prudent thoughts,"
8914,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Wishing to hope without a hope, some fears"
8915,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"About my future worldly maintenance,"
8916,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And, more than all, a strangeness in the mind,                      80"
8917,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A feeling that I was not for that hour,"
8918,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Nor for that place. But wherefore be cast down?
8919,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,For (not to speak of Reason and her pure
8920,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Reflective acts to fix the moral law
8921,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Deep in the conscience, nor of Christian Hope,                      85"
8922,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Bowing her head before her sister Faith
8923,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"As one far mightier), hither I had come,"
8924,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Bear witness Truth, endowed with holy powers"
8925,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And faculties, whether to work or feel."
8926,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Oft when the dazzling show no longer new                            90
8927,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Had ceased to dazzle, ofttimes did I quit"
8928,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"My comrades, leave the crowd, buildings and groves,"
8929,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And as I paced alone the level fields
8930,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Far from those lovely sights and sounds sublime
8931,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"With which I had been conversant, the mind                          95"
8932,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Drooped not; but there into herself returning,"
8933,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,With prompt rebound seemed fresh as heretofore.
8934,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,At least I more distinctly recognised
8935,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Her native instincts: let me dare to speak
8936,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A higher language, say that now I felt                             100"
8937,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"What independent solaces were mine,"
8938,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To mitigate the injurious sway of place
8939,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Or circumstance, how far soever changed"
8940,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In youth, or to be changed in manhood's prime;"
8941,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Or for the few who shall be called to look                         105
8942,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"On the long shadows in our evening years,"
8943,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Ordained precursors to the night of death.
8944,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"As if awakened, summoned, roused, constrained,"
8945,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,I looked for universal things; perused
8946,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The common countenance of earth and sky:                           110
8947,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Earth, nowhere unembellished by some trace"
8948,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of that first Paradise whence man was driven;
8949,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And sky, whose beauty and bounty are expressed"
8950,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,By the proud name she bears--the name of Heaven.
8951,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,I called on both to teach me what they might;                      115
8952,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Or turning the mind in upon herself
8953,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Pored, watched, expected, listened, spread my thoughts"
8954,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And spread them with a wider creeping; felt
8955,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Incumbencies more awful, visitings"
8956,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of the Upholder of the tranquil soul,                              120"
8957,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"That tolerates the indignities of Time,"
8958,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And, from the centre of Eternity"
8959,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"All finite motions overruling, lives"
8960,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,In glory immutable. But peace! enough
8961,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Here to record that I was mounting now                             125
8962,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To such community with highest truth--
8963,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A track pursuing, not untrod before,"
8964,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,From strict analogies by thought supplied
8965,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Or consciousnesses not to be subdued.
8966,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To every natural form, rock, fruit or flower,                      130"
8967,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Even the loose stones that cover the high-way,"
8968,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I gave a moral life: I saw them feel,"
8969,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Or linked them to some feeling: the great mass
8970,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Lay bedded in a quickening soul, and all"
8971,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That I beheld respired with inward meaning.                        135
8972,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Add that whate'er of Terror or of Love
8973,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Or Beauty, Nature's daily face put on"
8974,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"From transitory passion, unto this"
8975,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,I was as sensitive as waters are
8976,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To the sky's influence in a kindred mood                           140
8977,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of passion; was obedient as a lute
8978,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That waits upon the touches of the wind.
8979,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Unknown, unthought of, yet I was most rich--"
8980,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,I had a world about me--'twas my own;
8981,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I made it, for it only lived to me,                                145"
8982,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And to the God who sees into the heart.
8983,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Such sympathies, though rarely, were betrayed"
8984,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,By outward gestures and by visible looks:
8985,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Some called it madness--so indeed it was,"
8986,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"If child-like fruitfulness in passing joy,                         150"
8987,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,If steady moods of thoughtfulness matured
8988,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To inspiration, sort with such a name;"
8989,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,If prophecy be madness; if things viewed
8990,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"By poets in old time, and higher up"
8991,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"By the first men, earth's first inhabitants,                       155"
8992,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,May in these tutored days no more be seen
8993,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"With undisordered sight. But leaving this,"
8994,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"It was no madness, for the bodily eye"
8995,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Amid my strongest workings evermore
8996,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Was searching out the lines of difference                          160
8997,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"As they lie hid in all external forms,"
8998,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Near or remote, minute or vast, an eye"
8999,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Which from a tree, a stone, a withered leaf,"
9000,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To the broad ocean and the azure heavens
9001,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Spangled with kindred multitudes of stars,                         165"
9002,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Could find no surface where its power might sleep;
9003,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Which spake perpetual logic to my soul,"
9004,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And by an unrelenting agency
9005,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Did bind my feelings even as in a chain.
9006,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9007,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And here, O Friend! have I retraced my life                      170"
9008,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Up to an eminence, and told a tale"
9009,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of matters which not falsely may be called
9010,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"The glory of my youth. Of genius, power,"
9011,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Creation and divinity itself
9012,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I have been speaking, for my theme has been                        175"
9013,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,What passed within me. Not of outward things
9014,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Done visibly for other minds, words, signs,"
9015,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Symbols or actions, but of my own heart"
9016,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Have I been speaking, and my youthful mind."
9017,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"O Heavens! how awful is the might of souls,                        180"
9018,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And what they do within themselves while yet
9019,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"The yoke of earth is new to them, the world"
9020,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Nothing but a wild field where they were sown.
9021,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"This is, in truth, heroic argument,"
9022,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"This genuine prowess, which I wished to touch                      185"
9023,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"With hand however weak, but in the main"
9024,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,It lies far hidden from the reach of words.
9025,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Points have we all of us within our souls
9026,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Where all stand single; this I feel, and make"
9027,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Breathings for incommunicable powers;                              190
9028,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,But is not each a memory to himself?
9029,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And, therefore, now that we must quit this theme,"
9030,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I am not heartless, for there's not a man"
9031,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"That lives who hath not known his god-like hours,"
9032,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And feels not what an empire we inherit                            195
9033,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,As natural beings in the strength of Nature.
9034,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9035,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,No more: for now into a populous plain
9036,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"We must descend. A Traveller I am,"
9037,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Whose tale is only of himself; even so,"
9038,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"So be it, if the pure of heart be prompt                           200"
9039,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To follow, and if thou, my honoured Friend!"
9040,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Who in these thoughts art ever at my side,"
9041,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Support, as heretofore, my fainting steps."
9042,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9043,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"It hath been told, that when the first delight"
9044,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That flashed upon me from this novel show                          205
9045,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Had failed, the mind returned into herself;"
9046,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Yet true it is, that I had made a change"
9047,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In climate, and my nature's outward coat"
9048,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Changed also slowly and insensibly.
9049,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Full oft the quiet and exalted thoughts                            210
9050,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of loneliness gave way to empty noise
9051,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And superficial pastimes; now and then
9052,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Forced labour, and more frequently forced hopes;"
9053,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And, worst of all, a treasonable growth"
9054,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of indecisive judgments, that impaired                             215"
9055,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And shook the mind's simplicity.--And yet
9056,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,This was a gladsome time. Could I behold--
9057,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Who, less insensible than sodden clay"
9058,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In a sea-river's bed at ebb of tide,"
9059,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Could have beheld,--with undelighted heart,                        220"
9060,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"So many happy youths, so wide and fair"
9061,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,A congregation in its budding-time
9062,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of health, and hope, and beauty, all at once"
9063,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,So many divers samples from the growth
9064,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of life's sweet season--could have seen unmoved                    225
9065,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers
9066,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Decking the matron temples of a place
9067,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"So famous through the world? To me, at least,"
9068,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"It was a goodly prospect: for, in sooth,"
9069,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Though I had learnt betimes to stand unpropped,                    230"
9070,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And independent musings pleased me so
9071,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"That spells seemed on me when I was alone,"
9072,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Yet could I only cleave to solitude
9073,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,In lonely places; if a throng was near
9074,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That way I leaned by nature; for my heart                          235
9075,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Was social, and loved idleness and joy."
9076,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9077,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Not seeking those who might participate
9078,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"My deeper pleasures (nay, I had not once,"
9079,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Though not unused to mutter lonesome songs,"
9080,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Even with myself divided such delight,                             240"
9081,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Or looked that way for aught that might be clothed
9082,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In human language), easily I passed"
9083,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"From the remembrances of better things,"
9084,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And slipped into the ordinary works
9085,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of careless youth, unburthened, unalarmed.                         245"
9086,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,_Caverns_ there were within my mind which sun
9087,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Could never penetrate, yet did there not"
9088,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Want store of leafy _arbours_ where the light
9089,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Might enter in at will. Companionships,"
9090,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Friendships, acquaintances, were welcome all.                      250"
9091,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"We sauntered, played, or rioted; we talked"
9092,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Unprofitable talk at morning hours;
9093,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Drifted about along the streets and walks,"
9094,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Read lazily in trivial books, went forth"
9095,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To gallop through the country in blind zeal                        255
9096,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of senseless horsemanship, or on the breast"
9097,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of Cam sailed boisterously, and let the stars"
9098,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Come forth, perhaps without one quiet thought."
9099,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9100,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Such was the tenor of the second act
9101,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In this new life. Imagination slept,                               260"
9102,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And yet not utterly. I could not print
9103,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Ground where the grass had yielded to the steps
9104,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of generations of illustrious men,"
9105,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Unmoved. I could not always lightly pass
9106,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Through the same gateways, sleep where they had slept,             265"
9107,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Wake where they waked, range that inclosure old,"
9108,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"That garden of great intellects, undisturbed."
9109,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Place also by the side of this dark sense
9110,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of noble feeling, that those spiritual men,"
9111,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Even the great Newton's own ethereal self,                         270"
9112,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Seemed humbled in these precincts thence to be
9113,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The more endeared. Their several memories here
9114,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,(Even like their persons in their portraits clothed
9115,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,With the accustomed garb of daily life)
9116,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Put on a lowly and a touching grace                                275
9117,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of more distinct humanity, that left"
9118,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,All genuine admiration unimpaired.
9119,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9120,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Beside the pleasant Mill of Trompington [D]
9121,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,I laughed with Chaucer in the hawthorn shade;
9122,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Heard him, while birds were warbling, tell his tales               280"
9123,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of amorous passion. And that gentle Bard,"
9124,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Chosen by the Muses for their Page of State--
9125,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Sweet Spenser, moving through his clouded heaven"
9126,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"With the moon's beauty and the moon's soft pace,"
9127,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I called him Brother, Englishman, and Friend!                      285"
9128,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Yea, our blind Poet, who, in his later day,"
9129,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Stood almost single; uttering odious truth--
9130,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Darkness before, and danger's voice behind,"
9131,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Soul awful--if the earth has ever lodged
9132,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,An awful soul--I seemed to see him here                            290
9133,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Familiarly, and in his scholar's dress"
9134,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Bounding before me, yet a stripling youth--"
9135,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A boy, no better, with his rosy cheeks"
9136,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Angelical, keen eye, courageous look,"
9137,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And conscious step of purity and pride.                            295
9138,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Among the band of my compeers was one
9139,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Whom chance had stationed in the very room
9140,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Honoured by Milton's name. O temperate Bard!
9141,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Be it confest that, for the first time, seated"
9142,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Within thy innocent lodge and oratory,                             300"
9143,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"One of a festive circle, I poured out"
9144,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Libations, to thy memory drank, till pride"
9145,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And gratitude grew dizzy in a brain
9146,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Never excited by the fumes of wine
9147,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Before that hour, or since. Then, forth I ran                      305"
9148,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"From the assembly; through a length of streets,"
9149,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Ran, ostrich-like, to reach our chapel door"
9150,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In not a desperate or opprobrious time,"
9151,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Albeit long after the importunate bell
9152,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Had stopped, with wearisome Cassandra voice                        310"
9153,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,No longer haunting the dark winter night.
9154,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Call back, O Friend! [E] a moment to thy mind,"
9155,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The place itself and fashion of the rites.
9156,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,With careless ostentation shouldering up
9157,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"My surplice, [F] through the inferior throng I clove               315"
9158,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of the plain Burghers, who in audience stood"
9159,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"On the last skirts of their permitted ground,"
9160,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Under the pealing organ. Empty thoughts!
9161,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I am ashamed of them: and that great Bard,"
9162,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And thou, O Friend! who in thy ample mind                          320"
9163,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Hast placed me high above my best deserts,"
9164,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Ye will forgive the weakness of that hour,"
9165,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In some of its unworthy vanities,"
9166,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Brother to many more.
9167,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,In this mixed sort
9168,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"The months passed on, remissly, not given up                       325"
9169,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To wilful alienation from the right,"
9170,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Or walks of open scandal, but in vague"
9171,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And loose indifference, easy likings, aims"
9172,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of a low pitch--duty and zeal dismissed,"
9173,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Yet Nature, or a happy course of things                            330"
9174,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Not doing in their stead the needful work.
9175,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"The memory languidly revolved, the heart"
9176,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Reposed in noontide rest, the inner pulse"
9177,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of contemplation almost failed to beat.
9178,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Such life might not inaptly be compared                            335
9179,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To a floating island, an amphibious spot"
9180,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Unsound, of spongy texture, yet withal"
9181,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Not wanting a fair face of water weeds
9182,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And pleasant flowers. [G] The thirst of living praise,"
9183,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Fit reverence for the glorious Dead, the sight                     340"
9184,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of those long vistas, sacred catacombs,"
9185,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Where mighty minds lie visibly entombed,"
9186,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Have often stirred the heart of youth, and bred"
9187,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,A fervent love of rigorous discipline.--
9188,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Alas! such high emotion touched not me.                            345
9189,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Look was there none within these walls to shame
9190,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"My easy spirits, and discountenance"
9191,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Their light composure, far less to instil"
9192,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A calm resolve of mind, firmly addressed"
9193,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To puissant efforts. Nor was this the blame                        350
9194,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of others, but my own; I should, in truth,"
9195,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"As far as doth concern my single self,"
9196,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Misdeem most widely, lodging it elsewhere:"
9197,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"For I, bred up 'mid Nature's luxuries,"
9198,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Was a spoiled child, and rambling like the wind,                   355"
9199,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,As I had done in daily intercourse
9200,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"With those crystalline rivers, solemn heights,"
9201,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And mountains, ranging like a fowl of the air,"
9202,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,I was ill-tutored for captivity;
9203,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To quit my pleasure, and, from month to month,                     360"
9204,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Take up a station calmly on the perch
9205,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of sedentary peace. Those lovely forms
9206,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Had also left less space within my mind,"
9207,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Which, wrought upon instinctively, had found"
9208,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A freshness in those objects of her love,                          365"
9209,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A winning power, beyond all other power."
9210,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Not that I slighted books, [H]--that were to lack"
9211,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"All sense,--but other passions in me ruled,"
9212,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Passions more fervent, making me less prompt"
9213,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To in-door study than was wise or well,                            370"
9214,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Or suited to those years. Yet I, though used"
9215,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In magisterial liberty to rove,"
9216,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Culling such flowers of learning as might tempt
9217,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A random choice, could shadow forth a place"
9218,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,(If now I yield not to a flattering dream)                         375
9219,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Whose studious aspect should have bent me down
9220,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To instantaneous service; should at once
9221,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Have made me pay to science and to arts
9222,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And written lore, acknowledged my liege lord,"
9223,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A homage frankly offered up, like that                             380"
9224,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Which I had paid to Nature. Toil and pains
9225,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In this recess, by thoughtful Fancy built,"
9226,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Should spread from heart to heart; and stately groves,"
9227,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Majestic edifices, should not want"
9228,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,A corresponding dignity within.                                    385
9229,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The congregating temper that pervades
9230,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Our unripe years, not wasted, should be taught"
9231,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To minister to works of high attempt--
9232,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Works which the enthusiast would perform with love.
9233,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Youth should be awed, religiously possessed                        390"
9234,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,With a conviction of the power that waits
9235,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"On knowledge, when sincerely sought and prized"
9236,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"For its own sake, on glory and on praise"
9237,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"If but by labour won, and fit to endure"
9238,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The passing day; should learn to put aside                         395
9239,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Her trappings here, should strip them off abashed"
9240,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Before antiquity and stedfast truth
9241,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And strong book-mindedness; and over all
9242,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A healthy sound simplicity should reign,"
9243,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A seemly plainness, name it what you will,                         400"
9244,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Republican or pious.
9245,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,If these thoughts
9246,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Are a gratuitous emblazonry
9247,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"That mocks the recreant age _we_ live in, then"
9248,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Be Folly and False-seeming free to affect
9249,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Whatever formal gait of discipline                                 405
9250,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Shall raise them highest in their own esteem--
9251,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Let them parade among the Schools at will,"
9252,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,But spare the House of God. Was ever known
9253,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The witless shepherd who persists to drive
9254,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,A flock that thirsts not to a pool disliked?                       410
9255,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,A weight must surely hang on days begun
9256,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And ended with such mockery. Be wise,"
9257,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Ye Presidents and Deans, and, till the spirit"
9258,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of ancient times revive, and youth be trained"
9259,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"At home in pious service, to your bells                            415"
9260,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Give seasonable rest, for 'tis a sound"
9261,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Hollow as ever vexed the tranquil air;
9262,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And your officious doings bring disgrace
9263,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"On the plain steeples of our English Church,"
9264,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Whose worship, 'mid remotest village trees,                        420"
9265,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Suffers for this. Even Science, too, at hand"
9266,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In daily sight of this irreverence,"
9267,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Is smitten thence with an unnatural taint,"
9268,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Loses her just authority, falls beneath"
9269,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Collateral suspicion, else unknown.                                425"
9270,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"This truth escaped me not, and I confess,"
9271,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That having 'mid my native hills given loose
9272,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To a schoolboy's vision, I had raised a pile"
9273,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Upon the basis of the coming time,"
9274,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"That fell in ruins round me. Oh, what joy                          430"
9275,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To see a sanctuary for our country's youth
9276,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Informed with such a spirit as might be
9277,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Its own protection; a primeval grove,"
9278,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Where, though the shades with cheerfulness were filled,"
9279,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Nor indigent of songs warbled from crowds                          435
9280,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In under-coverts, yet the countenance"
9281,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of the whole place should bear a stamp of awe;
9282,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,A habitation sober and demure
9283,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,For ruminating creatures; a domain
9284,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,For quiet things to wander in; a haunt                             440
9285,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,In which the heron should delight to feed
9286,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"By the shy rivers, and the pelican"
9287,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Upon the cypress spire in lonely thought
9288,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Might sit and sun himself.--Alas! Alas!
9289,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,In vain for such solemnity I looked;                               445
9290,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Mine eyes were crossed by butterflies, ears vexed"
9291,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,By chattering popinjays; the inner heart
9292,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Seemed trivial, and the impresses without"
9293,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of a too gaudy region.
9294,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Different sight
9295,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Those venerable Doctors saw of old,                                450"
9296,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,When all who dwelt within these famous walls
9297,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Led in abstemiousness a studious life;
9298,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"When, in forlorn and naked chambers cooped"
9299,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And crowded, o'er the ponderous books they hung"
9300,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Like caterpillars eating out their way                             455
9301,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In silence, or with keen devouring noise"
9302,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Not to be tracked or fathered. Princes then
9303,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"At matins froze, and couched at curfew-time,"
9304,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Trained up through piety and zeal to prize
9305,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Spare diet, patient labour, and plain weeds.                       460"
9306,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,O seat of Arts! renowned throughout the world!
9307,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Far different service in those homely days
9308,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The Muses' modest nurslings underwent
9309,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,From their first childhood: in that glorious time
9310,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"When Learning, like a stranger come from far,                      465"
9311,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Sounding through Christian lands her trumpet, roused"
9312,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Peasant and king; when boys and youths, the growth"
9313,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of ragged villages and crazy huts,"
9314,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Forsook their homes, and, errant in the quest"
9315,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of Patron, famous school or friendly nook,                         470"
9316,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Where, pensioned, they in shelter might sit down,"
9317,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,From town to town and through wide scattered realms
9318,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Journeyed with ponderous folios in their hands;
9319,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And often, starting from some covert place,"
9320,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Saluted the chance comer on the road,                              475"
9321,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Crying, ""An obolus, a penny give"
9322,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To a poor scholar!"" [I]--when illustrious men,"
9323,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Lovers of truth, by penury constrained,"
9324,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Bucer, Erasmus, or Melancthon, read"
9325,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Before the doors or windows of their cells                         480
9326,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,By moonshine through mere lack of taper light.
9327,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9328,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,But peace to vain regrets! We see but darkly
9329,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Even when we look behind us, and best things"
9330,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Are not so pure by nature that they needs
9331,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Must keep to all, as fondly all believe,                           485"
9332,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Their highest promise. If the mariner,"
9333,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,When at reluctant distance he hath passed
9334,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Some tempting island, could but know the ills"
9335,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That must have fallen upon him had he brought
9336,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"His bark to land upon the wished-for shore,                        490"
9337,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Good cause would oft be his to thank the surf
9338,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Whose white belt scared him thence, or wind that blew"
9339,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Inexorably adverse: for myself
9340,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I grieve not; happy is the gownèd youth,"
9341,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Who only misses what I missed, who falls                           495"
9342,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,No lower than I fell.
9343,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9344,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I did not love,"
9345,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Judging not ill perhaps, the timid course"
9346,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of our scholastic studies; could have wished
9347,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To see the river flow with ampler range
9348,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And freer pace; but more, far more, I grieved                      500"
9349,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To see displayed among an eager few,"
9350,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Who in the field of contest persevered,"
9351,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Passions unworthy of youth's generous heart
9352,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And mounting spirit, pitiably repaid,"
9353,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"When so disturbed, whatever palms are won.                         505"
9354,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,From these I turned to travel with the shoal
9355,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of more unthinking natures, easy minds"
9356,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And pillowy; yet not wanting love that makes
9357,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"The day pass lightly on, when foresight sleeps,"
9358,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And wisdom and the pledges interchanged                            510
9359,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,With our own inner being are forgot.
9360,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9361,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Yet was this deep vacation not given up
9362,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To utter waste. Hitherto I had stood
9363,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In my own mind remote from social life,"
9364,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"(At least from what we commonly so name,)                          515"
9365,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Like a lone shepherd on a promontory
9366,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Who lacking occupation looks far forth
9367,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Into the boundless sea, and rather makes"
9368,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Than finds what he beholds. And sure it is,"
9369,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That this first transit from the smooth delights                   520
9370,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And wild outlandish walks of simple youth
9371,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To something that resembles an approach
9372,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Towards human business, to a privileged world"
9373,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Within a world, a midway residence"
9374,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"With all its intervenient imagery,                                 525"
9375,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Did better suit my visionary mind,"
9376,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Far better, than to have been bolted forth;"
9377,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Thrust out abruptly into Fortune's way
9378,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Among the conflicts of substantial life;
9379,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,By a more just gradation did lead on                               530
9380,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To higher things; more naturally matured,"
9381,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"For permanent possession, better fruits,"
9382,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Whether of truth or virtue, to ensue."
9383,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In serious mood, but oftener, I confess,"
9384,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,With playful zest of fancy did we note                             535
9385,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,(How could we less?) the manners and the ways
9386,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of those who lived distinguished by the badge
9387,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of good or ill report; or those with whom
9388,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,By frame of Academic discipline
9389,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"We were perforce connected, men whose sway                         540"
9390,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And known authority of office served
9391,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To set our minds on edge, and did no more."
9392,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Nor wanted we rich pastime of this kind,"
9393,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Found everywhere, but chiefly in the ring"
9394,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of the grave Elders, men unsecured, grotesque                      545"
9395,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"In character, tricked out like aged trees"
9396,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Which through the lapse of their infirmity
9397,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Give ready place to any random seed
9398,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That chooses to be reared upon their trunks.
9399,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9400,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Here on my view, confronting vividly                             550"
9401,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Those shepherd swains whom I had lately left,"
9402,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Appeared a different aspect of old age;
9403,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"How different! yet both distinctly marked,"
9404,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Objects embossed to catch the general eye,"
9405,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Or portraitures for special use designed,                          555"
9406,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"As some might seem, so aptly do they serve"
9407,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,To illustrate Nature's book of rudiments--
9408,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That book upheld as with maternal care
9409,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,When she would enter on her tender scheme
9410,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of teaching comprehension with delight,                            560"
9411,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And mingling playful with pathetic thoughts.
9412,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9413,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The surfaces of artificial life
9414,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And manners finely wrought, the delicate race"
9415,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of colours, lurking, gleaming up and down"
9416,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Through that state arras woven with silk and gold;                 565
9417,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"This wily interchange of snaky hues,"
9418,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Willingly or unwillingly revealed,"
9419,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,I neither knew nor cared for; and as such
9420,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Were wanting here, I took what might be found"
9421,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of less elaborate fabric. At this day                              570
9422,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"I smile, in many a mountain solitude"
9423,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Conjuring up scenes as obsolete in freaks
9424,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of character, in points of wit as broad,"
9425,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,As aught by wooden images performed
9426,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,For entertainment of the gaping crowd                              575
9427,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,At wake or fair. And oftentimes do flit
9428,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Remembrances before me of old men--
9429,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Old humourists, who have been long in their graves,"
9430,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And having almost in my mind put off
9431,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Their human names, have into phantoms passed                       580"
9432,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of texture midway between life and books.
9433,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9434,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,I play the loiterer: 'tis enough to note
9435,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That here in dwarf proportions were expressed
9436,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The limbs of the great world; its eager strifes
9437,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Collaterally pourtrayed, as in mock fight,                         585"
9438,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A tournament of blows, some hardly dealt"
9439,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Though short of mortal combat; and whate'er
9440,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Might in this pageant be supposed to hit
9441,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"An artless rustic's notice, this way less,"
9442,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"More that way, was not wasted upon me--590"
9443,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And yet the spectacle may well demand
9444,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A more substantial name, no mimic show,"
9445,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Itself a living part of a live whole,"
9446,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"A creek in the vast sea; for, all degrees"
9447,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And shapes of spurious fame and short-lived praise                 595
9448,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Here sate in state, and fed with daily alms"
9449,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Retainers won away from solid good;
9450,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And here was Labour, his own bond-slave; Hope,"
9451,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,That never set the pains against the prize;
9452,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Idleness halting with his weary clog,                              600"
9453,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And poor misguided Shame, and witless Fear,"
9454,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And simple Pleasure foraging for Death;
9455,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Honour misplaced, and Dignity astray;"
9456,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Feuds, factions, flatteries, enmity, and guile"
9457,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Murmuring submission, and bald government,                         605"
9458,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"(The idol weak as the idolater),"
9459,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And Decency and Custom starving Truth,"
9460,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And blind Authority beating with his staff
9461,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The child that might have led him; Emptiness
9462,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Followed as of good omen, and meek Worth                           610"
9463,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Left to herself unheard of and unknown.
9464,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,
9465,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Of these and other kindred notices
9466,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,I cannot say what portion is in truth
9467,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"The naked recollection of that time,"
9468,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And what may rather have been called to life                       615
9469,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,By after-meditation. But delight
9470,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"That, in an easy temper lulled asleep,"
9471,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Is still with Innocence its own reward,"
9472,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,This was not wanting. Carelessly I roamed
9473,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,As through a wide museum from whose stores                         620
9474,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,A casual rarity is singled out
9475,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"And has its brief perusal, then gives way"
9476,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"To others, all supplanted in their turn;"
9477,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Till 'mid this crowded neighbourhood of things
9478,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"That are by nature most unneighbourly,                             625"
9479,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,The head turns round and cannot right itself;
9480,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,And though an aching and a barren sense
9481,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Of gay confusion still be uppermost,"
9482,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"With few wise longings and but little love,"
9483,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,"Yet to the memory something cleaves at last,                       630"
9484,RESIDENCE AT CAMBRIDGE,Whence profit may be drawn in times to come.

9693,SUMMER VACATION,Some lovely Image in the song rose up
9694,SUMMER VACATION,"Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;"
9695,SUMMER VACATION,Then have I darted forwards to let                                 115
9696,SUMMER VACATION,"My hand upon his back with stormy joy,"
9697,SUMMER VACATION,Caressing him again and yet again.
9698,SUMMER VACATION,And when at evening on the public way
9699,SUMMER VACATION,"I sauntered, like a river murmuring"
9700,SUMMER VACATION,And talking to itself when all things                              120
9701,SUMMER VACATION,"Are still, the creature trotted on before;"
9702,SUMMER VACATION,Such was his custom; but whene'er he met
9703,SUMMER VACATION,"A passenger approaching, he would turn"
9704,SUMMER VACATION,"To give me timely notice, and straightway,"
9705,SUMMER VACATION,"Grateful for that admonishment, I                                  125"
9706,SUMMER VACATION,"My voice, composed my gait, and, with the air"
9707,SUMMER VACATION,"And mien of one whose thoughts are free, advanced"
9708,SUMMER VACATION,To give and take a greeting that might save
9709,SUMMER VACATION,"My name from piteous rumours, such as wait"
9710,SUMMER VACATION,On men suspected to be crazed in brain.                            130
9711,SUMMER VACATION,
9712,SUMMER VACATION,Those walks well worthy to be prized and loved--
9713,SUMMER VACATION,"Regretted!--that word, too, was on my tongue,"
9714,SUMMER VACATION,"But they were richly laden with all good,"
9715,SUMMER VACATION,And cannot be remembered but with thanks
9716,SUMMER VACATION,"And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart--135"
9717,SUMMER VACATION,Those walks in all their freshness now came back
9718,SUMMER VACATION,Like a returning Spring. When first I made
9719,SUMMER VACATION,"Once more the circuit of our little lake,"
9720,SUMMER VACATION,"If ever happiness hath lodged with man,"
9721,SUMMER VACATION,"That day consummate happiness was mine,                            140"
9722,SUMMER VACATION,"Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative."
9723,SUMMER VACATION,"The sun was set, or setting, when I left"
9724,SUMMER VACATION,"Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on"
9725,SUMMER VACATION,"A sober hour, not winning or serene,"
9726,SUMMER VACATION,"For cold and raw the air was, and untuned;                         145"
9727,SUMMER VACATION,But as a face we love is sweetest then
9728,SUMMER VACATION,"When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look"
9729,SUMMER VACATION,"It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart"
9730,SUMMER VACATION,Have fulness in herself; even so with me
9731,SUMMER VACATION,It fared that evening. Gently did my soul                          150
9732,SUMMER VACATION,"Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood"
9733,SUMMER VACATION,"Naked, as in the presence of her God."
9734,SUMMER VACATION,"While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch"
9735,SUMMER VACATION,A heart that had not been disconsolate:
9736,SUMMER VACATION,"Strength came where weakness was not known to be,                  155"
9737,SUMMER VACATION,At least not felt; and restoration came
9738,SUMMER VACATION,Like an intruder knocking at the door
9739,SUMMER VACATION,Of unacknowledged weariness. I took
9740,SUMMER VACATION,"The balance, and with firm hand weighed myself."
9741,SUMMER VACATION,"--Of that external scene which round me lay,                       160"
9742,SUMMER VACATION,"Little, in this abstraction, did I see;"
9743,SUMMER VACATION,Remembered less; but I had inward hopes
9744,SUMMER VACATION,"And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and soothed,"
9745,SUMMER VACATION,"Conversed with promises, had glimmering views"
9746,SUMMER VACATION,How life pervades the undecaying mind;                             165
9747,SUMMER VACATION,How the immortal soul with God-like power
9748,SUMMER VACATION,"Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep"
9749,SUMMER VACATION,"That time can lay upon her; how on earth,"
9750,SUMMER VACATION,"Man, if he do but live within the light"
9751,SUMMER VACATION,"Of high endeavours, daily spreads abroad                           170"
9752,SUMMER VACATION,His being armed with strength that cannot fail.
9753,SUMMER VACATION,"Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love"
9754,SUMMER VACATION,"Of innocence, and holiday repose;"
9755,SUMMER VACATION,"And more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir"
9756,SUMMER VACATION,"Of boldest projects, and a peaceful end                            175"
9757,SUMMER VACATION,"At last, or glorious, by endurance won."
9758,SUMMER VACATION,"Thus musing, in a wood I sate me down"
9759,SUMMER VACATION,"Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes"
9760,SUMMER VACATION,And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread
9761,SUMMER VACATION,"With darkness, and before a rippling breeze                        180"
9762,SUMMER VACATION,"The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,"
9763,SUMMER VACATION,"And in the sheltered coppice where I sate,"
9764,SUMMER VACATION,"Around me from among the hazel leaves,"
9765,SUMMER VACATION,"Now here, now there, moved by the straggling wind,"
9766,SUMMER VACATION,"Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,                            185"
9767,SUMMER VACATION,"Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,"
9768,SUMMER VACATION,The off and on companion of my walk;
9769,SUMMER VACATION,"And such, at times, believing them to be,"
9770,SUMMER VACATION,I turned my head to look if he were there;
9771,SUMMER VACATION,Then into solemn thought I passed once more.                       190
9772,SUMMER VACATION,
9773,SUMMER VACATION,A freshness also found I at this time
9774,SUMMER VACATION,"In human Life, the daily life of those"
9775,SUMMER VACATION,Whose occupations really I loved;
9776,SUMMER VACATION,The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise
9777,SUMMER VACATION,Changed like a garden in the heat of spring                        195
9778,SUMMER VACATION,After an eight-days' absence. For (to omit
9779,SUMMER VACATION,The things which were the same and yet appeared
9780,SUMMER VACATION,"Fair otherwise) amid this rural solitude,"
9781,SUMMER VACATION,"A narrow Vale where each was known to all,"
9782,SUMMER VACATION,'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind                           200
9783,SUMMER VACATION,"To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook,"
9784,SUMMER VACATION,"Where an old man had used to sit alone,"
9785,SUMMER VACATION,Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left
9786,SUMMER VACATION,"In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet"
9787,SUMMER VACATION,Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;                       205
9788,SUMMER VACATION,"And growing girls whose beauty, filched away"
9789,SUMMER VACATION,"With all its pleasant promises, was gone"
9790,SUMMER VACATION,To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.
9791,SUMMER VACATION,
9792,SUMMER VACATION,"Yes, I had something of a subtler sense,"
9793,SUMMER VACATION,And often looking round was moved to smiles                        210
9794,SUMMER VACATION,Such as a delicate work of humour breeds;
9795,SUMMER VACATION,"I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,"
9796,SUMMER VACATION,Of those plain-living people now observed
9797,SUMMER VACATION,With clearer knowledge; with another eye
9798,SUMMER VACATION,"I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,                              215"
9799,SUMMER VACATION,"The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,"
9800,SUMMER VACATION,"This chiefly, did I note my grey-haired Dame;"
9801,SUMMER VACATION,Saw her go forth to church or other work
9802,SUMMER VACATION,"Of state, equipped in monumental trim;"
9803,SUMMER VACATION,"Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like),                      220"
9804,SUMMER VACATION,A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers
9805,SUMMER VACATION,"Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life,"
9806,SUMMER VACATION,"Affectionate without disquietude,"
9807,SUMMER VACATION,"Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less"
9808,SUMMER VACATION,Her clear though shallow stream of piety                           225
9809,SUMMER VACATION,That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;
9810,SUMMER VACATION,With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read
9811,SUMMER VACATION,"Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,"
9812,SUMMER VACATION,"And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep"
9813,SUMMER VACATION,And made of it a pillow for her head.                              230
9814,SUMMER VACATION,
9815,SUMMER VACATION,"Nor less do I remember to have felt,"
9816,SUMMER VACATION,"Distinctly manifested at this time,"
9817,SUMMER VACATION,A human-heartedness about my love
9818,SUMMER VACATION,For objects hitherto the absolute wealth
9819,SUMMER VACATION,Of my own private being and no more:                               235
9820,SUMMER VACATION,"Which I had loved, even as a blessed spirit"
9821,SUMMER VACATION,"Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,"
9822,SUMMER VACATION,Might love in individual happiness.
9823,SUMMER VACATION,But now there opened on me other thoughts
9824,SUMMER VACATION,"Of change, congratulation or regret,                               240"
9825,SUMMER VACATION,A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;
9826,SUMMER VACATION,"The trees, the mountains shared it, and the brooks,"
9827,SUMMER VACATION,"The stars of Heaven, now seen in their old haunts--"
9828,SUMMER VACATION,"White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,"
9829,SUMMER VACATION,"Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,                         245"
9830,SUMMER VACATION,"Acquaintances of every little child,"
9831,SUMMER VACATION,"And Jupiter, my own beloved star!"
9832,SUMMER VACATION,"Whatever shadings of mortality,"
9833,SUMMER VACATION,Whatever imports from the world of death
9834,SUMMER VACATION,"Had come among these objects heretofore,                           250"
9835,SUMMER VACATION,"Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,"
9836,SUMMER VACATION,"Deep, gloomy were they, and severe; the scatterings"
9837,SUMMER VACATION,"Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way"
9838,SUMMER VACATION,In later youth to yearnings of a love
9839,SUMMER VACATION,"Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.                                 255"
9840,SUMMER VACATION,
9841,SUMMER VACATION,As one who hangs down-bending from the side
9842,SUMMER VACATION,"Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast"
9843,SUMMER VACATION,"Of a still water, solacing himself"
9844,SUMMER VACATION,With such discoveries as his eye can make
9845,SUMMER VACATION,"Beneath him in the bottom of the deep,                             260"
9846,SUMMER VACATION,"Sees many beauteous sights--weeds, fishes, flowers."
9847,SUMMER VACATION,"Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies more,"
9848,SUMMER VACATION,Yet often is perplexed and cannot part
9849,SUMMER VACATION,"The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky,"
9850,SUMMER VACATION,"Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depth                       265"
9851,SUMMER VACATION,"Of the clear flood, from things which there abide"
9852,SUMMER VACATION,In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam
9853,SUMMER VACATION,"Of his own image, by a sun-beam now,"
9854,SUMMER VACATION,"And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,"
9855,SUMMER VACATION,Impediments that make his task more sweet;                         270
9856,SUMMER VACATION,Such pleasant office have we long pursued
9857,SUMMER VACATION,Incumbent o'er the surface of past time
9858,SUMMER VACATION,"With like success, nor often have appeared"
9859,SUMMER VACATION,Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned
9860,SUMMER VACATION,"Than these to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!                    275"
9861,SUMMER VACATION,Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite
9862,SUMMER VACATION,"Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,"
9863,SUMMER VACATION,"There was an inner falling off--I loved,"
9864,SUMMER VACATION,"Loved deeply all that had been loved before,"
9865,SUMMER VACATION,More deeply even than ever: but a swarm                            280
9866,SUMMER VACATION,"Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds,"
9867,SUMMER VACATION,"And feast and dance, and public revelry,"
9868,SUMMER VACATION,"And sports and games (too grateful in themselves,"
9869,SUMMER VACATION,"Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,"
9870,SUMMER VACATION,Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh                         285
9871,SUMMER VACATION,Of manliness and freedom) all conspired
9872,SUMMER VACATION,To lure my mind from firm habitual quest
9873,SUMMER VACATION,"Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal"
9874,SUMMER VACATION,And damp those yearnings which had once been mine--
9875,SUMMER VACATION,"A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up                           290"
9876,SUMMER VACATION,To his own eager thoughts. It would demand
9877,SUMMER VACATION,"Some skill, and longer time than may be spared,"
9878,SUMMER VACATION,"To paint these vanities, and how they wrought"
9879,SUMMER VACATION,"In haunts where they, till now, had been unknown."
9880,SUMMER VACATION,It seemed the very garments that I wore                            295
9881,SUMMER VACATION,"Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet stream"
9882,SUMMER VACATION,Of self-forgetfulness.
9883,SUMMER VACATION,"Yes, that heartless chase"
9884,SUMMER VACATION,Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange
9885,SUMMER VACATION,For books and nature at that early age.
9886,SUMMER VACATION,"'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained                   300"
9887,SUMMER VACATION,"Of character or life; but at that time,"
9888,SUMMER VACATION,"Of manners put to school I took small note,"
9889,SUMMER VACATION,And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.
9890,SUMMER VACATION,Far better had it been to exalt the mind
9891,SUMMER VACATION,"By solitary study, to uphold                                       305"
9892,SUMMER VACATION,Intense desire through meditative peace;
9893,SUMMER VACATION,"And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,"
9894,SUMMER VACATION,The memory of one particular hour
9895,SUMMER VACATION,Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng
9896,SUMMER VACATION,"Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,                   310"
9897,SUMMER VACATION,"A medley of all tempers, I had passed"
9898,SUMMER VACATION,"The night in dancing, gaiety, and mirth,"
9899,SUMMER VACATION,"With din of instruments and shuffling feet,"
9900,SUMMER VACATION,"And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,"
9901,SUMMER VACATION,And unaimed prattle flying up and down; [R]                        315
9902,SUMMER VACATION,"Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there"
9903,SUMMER VACATION,"Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,"
9904,SUMMER VACATION,"Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,"
9905,SUMMER VACATION,"And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired,"
9906,SUMMER VACATION,"The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky                       320"
9907,SUMMER VACATION,"Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse"
9908,SUMMER VACATION,"And open field, through which the pathway wound,"
9909,SUMMER VACATION,And homeward led my steps. Magnificent
9910,SUMMER VACATION,"The morning rose, in memorable pomp,"
9911,SUMMER VACATION,"Glorious as e'er I had beheld--in front,                           325"
9912,SUMMER VACATION,"The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,"
9913,SUMMER VACATION,"The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,"
9914,SUMMER VACATION,"Grain-tinctured, drenched in empyrean light;"
9915,SUMMER VACATION,And in the meadows and the lower grounds
9916,SUMMER VACATION,Was all the sweetness of a common dawn--330
9917,SUMMER VACATION,"Dews, vapours, and the melody of birds, [S]"
9918,SUMMER VACATION,And labourers going forth to till the fields.
9919,SUMMER VACATION,"Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the brim"
9920,SUMMER VACATION,"My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows"
9921,SUMMER VACATION,Were then made for me; bond unknown to me                          335
9922,SUMMER VACATION,"Was given, that I should be, else sinning greatly,"
9923,SUMMER VACATION,A dedicated Spirit. On I walked
9924,SUMMER VACATION,"In thankful blessedness, which yet survives. [T]"
9925,SUMMER VACATION,
9926,SUMMER VACATION,Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that time
9927,SUMMER VACATION,"A parti-coloured show of grave and gay,                            340"
9928,SUMMER VACATION,"Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;"
9929,SUMMER VACATION,"Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,"
9930,SUMMER VACATION,Consorting in one mansion unreproved.
9931,SUMMER VACATION,"The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,"
9932,SUMMER VACATION,"Though slighted and too oft misused. Besides,                      345"
9933,SUMMER VACATION,"That summer, swarming as it did with thoughts"
9934,SUMMER VACATION,"Transient and idle, lacked not intervals"
9935,SUMMER VACATION,When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time
9936,SUMMER VACATION,"Shrunk, and the mind experienced in herself"
9937,SUMMER VACATION,Conformity as just as that of old                                  350
9938,SUMMER VACATION,"To the end and written spirit of God's works,"
9939,SUMMER VACATION,"Whether held forth in Nature or in Man,"
9940,SUMMER VACATION,"Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined."
9941,SUMMER VACATION,
9942,SUMMER VACATION,When from our better selves we have too long
9943,SUMMER VACATION,"Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,                      355"
9944,SUMMER VACATION,"Sick of its business, of its pleasures tired,"
9945,SUMMER VACATION,"How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;"
9946,SUMMER VACATION,How potent a mere image of her sway;
9947,SUMMER VACATION,Most potent when impressed upon the mind
9948,SUMMER VACATION,"With an appropriate human centre--hermit,                          360"
9949,SUMMER VACATION,Deep in the bosom of the wilderness;
9950,SUMMER VACATION,"Votary (in vast cathedral, where no foot"
9951,SUMMER VACATION,"Is treading, where no other face is seen)"
9952,SUMMER VACATION,Kneeling at prayers; or watchman on the top
9953,SUMMER VACATION,"Of lighthouse, beaten by Atlantic waves;                           365"
9954,SUMMER VACATION,Or as the soul of that great Power is met
9955,SUMMER VACATION,"Sometimes embodied on a public road,"
9956,SUMMER VACATION,"When, for the night deserted, it assumes"
9957,SUMMER VACATION,A character of quiet more profound
9958,SUMMER VACATION,Than pathless wastes.
9959,SUMMER VACATION,"Once, when those summer months                 370"
9960,SUMMER VACATION,"Were flown, and autumn brought its annual show"
9961,SUMMER VACATION,"Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,"
9962,SUMMER VACATION,"Upon Winander's spacious breast, it chanced"
9963,SUMMER VACATION,That--after I had left a flower-decked room
9964,SUMMER VACATION,"(Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived                       375"
9965,SUMMER VACATION,"To a late hour), and spirits overwrought"
9966,SUMMER VACATION,Were making night do penance for a day
9967,SUMMER VACATION,Spent in a round of strenuous idleness--[U]
9968,SUMMER VACATION,"My homeward course led up a long ascent,"
9969,SUMMER VACATION,"Where the road's watery surface, to the top                        380"
9970,SUMMER VACATION,"Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon"
9971,SUMMER VACATION,And bore the semblance of another stream
9972,SUMMER VACATION,Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook
9973,SUMMER VACATION,That murmured in the vale. [V] All else was still;
9974,SUMMER VACATION,"No living thing appeared in earth or air,                          385"
9975,SUMMER VACATION,"And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,"
9976,SUMMER VACATION,"Sound there was none--but, lo! an uncouth shape,"
9977,SUMMER VACATION,"Shown by a sudden turning of the road,"
9978,SUMMER VACATION,"So near that, slipping back into the shade"
9979,SUMMER VACATION,"Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,                        390"
9980,SUMMER VACATION,"Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,"
9981,SUMMER VACATION,"A span above man's common measure, tall,"
9982,SUMMER VACATION,"Stiff, lank, and upright; a more meagre man"
9983,SUMMER VACATION,Was never seen before by night or day.
9984,SUMMER VACATION,"Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth                    395"
9985,SUMMER VACATION,"Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,"
9986,SUMMER VACATION,A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken
9987,SUMMER VACATION,"That he was clothed in military garb,"
9988,SUMMER VACATION,"Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,"
9989,SUMMER VACATION,"No dog attending, by no staff sustained,                           400"
9990,SUMMER VACATION,"He stood, and in his very dress appeared"
9991,SUMMER VACATION,"A desolation, a simplicity,"

10030,SUMMER VACATION,Concise in answer; solemn and sublime
10031,SUMMER VACATION,"He might have seemed, but that in all he said"
10032,SUMMER VACATION,"There was a strange half-absence, as of one"
10033,SUMMER VACATION,"Knowing too well the importance of his theme,"

10035,SUMMER VACATION,"Soon ended, and together on we passed"
10036,SUMMER VACATION,In silence through a wood gloomy and still.
10037,SUMMER VACATION,"Up-turning, then, along an open field,"
10038,SUMMER VACATION,"We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked,"

10045,SUMMER VACATION,But ask for timely furtherance and help
10046,SUMMER VACATION,"Such as his state required. At this reproof,"
10047,SUMMER VACATION,"With the same ghastly mildness in his look,"

10049,SUMMER VACATION,"And in the eye of him who passes me!""                              460"
10050,SUMMER VACATION,
10051,SUMMER VACATION,"The cottage door was speedily unbarred,"
10052,SUMMER VACATION,And now the soldier touched his hat once more
10053,SUMMER VACATION,"With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,"
10054,SUMMER VACATION,Whose tone bespake reviving interests

10780,BOOKS,"A promise scarcely earthly. Instantly,"

11287,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Clothed in the sunshine of the withering fern; [B]
11288,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Quitted, not both, the mild magnificence"
11289,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of calmer lakes and louder streams; and you,"
11290,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Frank-hearted maids of rocky Cumberland,"
11291,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"You and your not unwelcome days of mirth,                           15"
11292,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Relinquished, and your nights of revelry,"
11293,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And in my own unlovely cell sate down
11294,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,In lightsome mood--such privilege has youth
11295,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That cannot take long leave of pleasant thoughts.
11296,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The bonds of indolent society                                       20
11297,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Relaxing in their hold, henceforth I lived"
11298,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,More to myself. Two winters may be passed
11299,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Without a separate notice: many books
11300,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Were skimmed, devoured, or studiously perused,"
11301,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,But with no settled plan. [C] I was detached                        25
11302,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Internally from academic cares;
11303,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Yet independent study seemed a course
11304,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of hardy disobedience toward friends
11305,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And kindred, proud rebellion and unkind."
11306,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"This spurious virtue, rather let it bear                            30"
11307,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A name it now deserves, this cowardice,"
11308,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Gave treacherous sanction to that over-love
11309,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of freedom which encouraged me to turn
11310,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,From regulations even of my own
11311,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,As from restraints and bonds. Yet who can tell--35
11312,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Who knows what thus may have been gained, both then"
11313,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And at a later season, or preserved;"
11314,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"What love of nature, what original strength"
11315,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of contemplation, what intuitive truths,"
11316,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The deepest and the best, what keen research,                       40"
11317,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Unbiassed, unbewildered, and unawed?"
11318,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11319,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The Poet's soul was with me at that time;
11320,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Sweet meditations, the still overflow"
11321,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of present happiness, while future years"
11322,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Lacked not anticipations, tender dreams,                            45"
11323,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,No few of which have since been realised;
11324,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And some remain, hopes for my future life."
11325,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Four years and thirty, told this very week, [D]"
11326,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Have I been now a sojourner on earth,"
11327,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,By sorrow not unsmitten; yet for me                                 50
11328,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Life's morning radiance hath not left the hills,"
11329,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Her dew is on the flowers. Those were the days
11330,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Which also first emboldened me to trust
11331,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With firmness, hitherto but lightly touched"
11332,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"By such a daring thought, that I might leave                        55"
11333,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Some monument behind me which pure hearts
11334,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Should reverence. The instinctive humbleness,"
11335,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Maintained even by the very name and thought
11336,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of printed books and authorship, began"
11337,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To melt away; and further, the dread awe                            60"
11338,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of mighty names was softened down and seemed
11339,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Approachable, admitting fellowship"
11340,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of modest sympathy. Such aspect now,"
11341,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Though not familiarly, my mind put on,"
11342,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Content to observe, to achieve, and to enjoy.                       65"
11343,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11344,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"All winter long, whenever free to choose,"
11345,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Did I by night frequent the College groves
11346,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And tributary walks; the last, and oft"
11347,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The only one, who had been lingering there"
11348,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Through hours of silence, till the porter's bell,                   70"
11349,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A punctual follower on the stroke of nine,"
11350,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Rang with its blunt unceremonious voice,"
11351,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Inexorable summons! Lofty elms,"
11352,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Inviting shades of opportune recess,"
11353,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Bestowed composure on a neighbourhood                               75
11354,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Unpeaceful in itself. A single tree
11355,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With sinuous trunk, boughs exquisitely wreathed,"
11356,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Grew there; [E] an ash which Winter for himself
11357,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Decked out with pride, and with outlandish grace:"
11358,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Up from the ground, and almost to the top,                          80"
11359,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The trunk and every master branch were green
11360,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With clustering ivy, and the lightsome twigs"
11361,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And outer spray profusely tipped with seeds
11362,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That hung in yellow tassels, while the air"
11363,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Stirred them, not voiceless. Often have I stood                     85"
11364,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Foot-bound uplooking at this lovely tree
11365,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Beneath a frosty moon. The hemisphere
11366,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of magic fiction, verse of mine perchance"
11367,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,May never tread; but scarcely Spenser's self
11368,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Could have more tranquil visions in his youth,                      90"
11369,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Or could more bright appearances create
11370,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of human forms with superhuman powers,"
11371,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Than I beheld loitering on calm clear nights
11372,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Alone, beneath this fairy work of earth."
11373,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11374,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,On the vague reading of a truant youth [F]                        95
11375,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,'Twere idle to descant. My inner judgment
11376,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Not seldom differed from my taste in books.
11377,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"As if it appertained to another mind,"
11378,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And yet the books which then I valued most
11379,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Are dearest to me _now_; for, having scanned,                      100"
11380,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Not heedlessly, the laws, and watched the forms"
11381,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of Nature, in that knowledge I possessed"
11382,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A standard, often usefully applied,"
11383,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Even when unconsciously, to things removed"
11384,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From a familiar sympathy.--In fine,                                105"
11385,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"I was a better judge of thoughts than words,"
11386,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Misled in estimating words, not only"
11387,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"By common inexperience of youth,"
11388,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"But by the trade in classic niceties,"
11389,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The dangerous craft of culling term and phrase                     110
11390,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,From languages that want the living voice
11391,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,To carry meaning to the natural heart;
11392,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To tell us what is passion, what is truth,"
11393,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"What reason, what simplicity and sense."
11394,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11395,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Yet may we not entirely overlook                                 115
11396,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The pleasure gathered from the rudiments
11397,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of geometric science. Though advanced
11398,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In these inquiries, with regret I speak,"
11399,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"No farther than the threshold, [G] there I found"
11400,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Both elevation and composed delight:                               120
11401,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With Indian awe and wonder, ignorance pleased"
11402,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With its own struggles, did I meditate"
11403,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,On the relation those abstractions bear
11404,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To Nature's laws, and by what process led,"
11405,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Those immaterial agents bowed their heads                          125
11406,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Duly to serve the mind of earth-born man;
11407,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From star to star, from kindred sphere to sphere,"
11408,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,From system on to system without end.
11409,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11410,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,More frequently from the same source I drew
11411,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A pleasure quiet and profound, a sense                             130"
11412,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of permanent and universal sway,"
11413,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And paramount belief; there, recognised"
11414,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A type, for finite natures, of the one"
11415,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Supreme Existence, the surpassing life"
11416,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Which--to the boundaries of space and time,                        135"
11417,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of melancholy space and doleful time,"
11418,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Superior, and incapable of change,"
11419,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Nor touched by welterings of passion--is,"
11420,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And hath the name of, God. Transcendent peace"
11421,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And silence did await upon these thoughts                          140
11422,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That were a frequent comfort to my youth.
11423,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11424,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"'Tis told by one whom stormy waters threw,"
11425,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With fellow-sufferers by the shipwreck spared,"
11426,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Upon a desert coast, that having brought"
11427,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To land a single volume, saved by chance,                          145"
11428,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A treatise of Geometry, he wont,"
11429,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Although of food and clothing destitute,"
11430,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And beyond common wretchedness depressed,"
11431,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,To part from company and take this book
11432,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,(Then first a self-taught pupil in its truths)                     150
11433,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To spots remote, and draw his diagrams"
11434,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With a long staff upon the sand, and thus"
11435,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Did oft beguile his sorrow, and almost"
11436,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Forget his feeling: so (if like effect
11437,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From the same cause produced, 'mid outward things                  155"
11438,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"So different, may rightly be compared),"
11439,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"So was it then with me, and so will be"
11440,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,With Poets ever. Mighty is the charm
11441,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of those abstractions to a mind beset
11442,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With images, and haunted by herself,                               160"
11443,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And specially delightful unto me
11444,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Was that clear synthesis built up aloft
11445,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,So gracefully; even then when it appeared
11446,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Not more than a mere plaything, or a toy"
11447,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,To sense embodied: not the thing it is                             165
11448,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In verity, an independent world,"
11449,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Created out of pure intelligence.
11450,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11451,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Such dispositions then were mine unearned
11452,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"By aught, I fear, of genuine desert--"
11453,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Mine, through heaven's grace and inborn aptitudes.                 170"
11454,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And not to leave the story of that time
11455,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Imperfect, with these habits must be joined,"
11456,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Moods melancholy, fits of spleen, that loved"
11457,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A pensive sky, sad days, and piping winds,"
11458,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The twilight more than dawn, autumn than spring; [H]               175"
11459,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,A treasured and luxurious gloom of choice
11460,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And inclination mainly, and the mere"
11461,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Redundancy of youth's contentedness.
11462,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"--To time thus spent, add multitudes of hours"
11463,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Pilfered away, by what the Bard who sang                           180"
11464,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of the Enchanter Indolence hath called
11465,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"""Good-natured lounging,"" [I] and behold a map"
11466,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of my collegiate life--far less intense
11467,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Than duty called for, or, without regard"
11468,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To duty, _might_ have sprung up of itself                          185"
11469,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"By change of accidents, or even, to speak"
11470,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Without unkindness, in another place."
11471,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Yet why take refuge in that plea?--the fault,"
11472,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"This I repeat, was mine; mine be the blame."
11473,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11474,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In summer, making quest for works of art,                        190"
11475,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Or scenes renowned for beauty, I explored"
11476,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That streamlet whose blue current works its way
11477,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Between romantic Dovedale's spiry rocks; [K]
11478,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Pried into Yorkshire dales, [L] or hidden tracts"
11479,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of my own native region, and was blest                             195"
11480,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Between these sundry wanderings with a joy
11481,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Above all joys, that seemed another morn"
11482,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Risen on mid noon; [M] blest with the presence, Friend!"
11483,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of that sole Sister, her who hath been long"
11484,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Dear to thee also, thy true friend and mine, [N]                   200"
11485,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Now, after separation desolate,"
11486,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Restored to me--such absence that she seemed
11487,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,A gift then first bestowed. [O] The varied banks
11488,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of Emont, hitherto unnamed in song, [P]"
11489,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And that monastic castle, 'mid tall trees,                         205"
11490,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Low-standing by the margin of the stream, [Q]"
11491,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,A mansion visited (as fame reports)
11492,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"By Sidney, [R] where, in sight of our Helvellyn,"
11493,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Or stormy Cross-fell, snatches he might pen"
11494,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of his Arcadia, by fraternal love                                  210"
11495,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Inspired;--that river and those mouldering towers
11496,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Have seen us side by side, when, having clomb"
11497,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The darksome windings of a broken stair,"
11498,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And crept along a ridge of fractured wall,"
11499,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Not without trembling, we in safety looked                         215"
11500,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Forth, through some Gothic window's open space,"
11501,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And gathered with one mind a rich reward
11502,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From the far-stretching landscape, by the light"
11503,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of morning beautified, or purple eve;"
11504,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Or, not less pleased, lay on some turret's head,                   220"
11505,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Catching from tufts of grass and hare-bell flowers
11506,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Their faintest whisper to the passing breeze,"
11507,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Given out while mid-day heat oppressed the plains.
11508,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11509,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Another maid there was, [S] who also shed"
11510,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A gladness o'er that season, then to me,                           225"
11511,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,By her exulting outside look of youth
11512,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And placid under-countenance, first endeared;"
11513,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That other spirit, Coleridge! who is now"
11514,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"So near to us, that meek confiding heart,"
11515,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,So reverenced by us both. O'er paths and fields                    230
11516,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In all that neighbourhood, through narrow lanes"
11517,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of eglantine, and through the shady woods,"
11518,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And o'er the Border Beacon, and the waste [T]"
11519,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of naked pools, and common crags that lay"
11520,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Exposed on the bare felt, were scattered love,                     235"
11521,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The spirit of pleasure, and youth's golden gleam."
11522,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"O Friend! we had not seen thee at that time,"
11523,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And yet a power is on me, and a strong"
11524,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Confusion, and I seem to plant thee there."
11525,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Far art thou wandered now in search of health                      240
11526,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And milder breezes,--melancholy lot! [U]"
11527,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"But thou art with us, with us in the past,"
11528,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The present, with us in the times to come."
11529,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"There is no grief, no sorrow, no despair,"
11530,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"No languor, no dejection, no dismay,                               245"
11531,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"No absence scarcely can there be, for those"
11532,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Who love as we do. Speed thee well! divide
11533,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With us thy pleasure; thy returning strength,"
11534,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Receive it daily as a joy of ours;
11535,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Share with us thy fresh spirits, whether gift                      250"
11536,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of gales Etesian or of tender thoughts. [V]
11537,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11538,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"I, too, have been a wanderer; but, alas!"
11539,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,How different the fate of different men.
11540,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Though mutually unknown, yea nursed and reared"
11541,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"As if in several elements, we were framed                          255"
11542,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To bend at last to the same discipline,"
11543,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Predestined, if two beings ever were,"
11544,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To seek the same delights, and have one health,"
11545,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"One happiness. Throughout this narrative,"
11546,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Else sooner ended, I have borne in mind                            260"
11547,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"For whom it registers the birth, and marks the growth,"
11548,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of gentleness, simplicity, and truth,"
11549,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And joyous loves, that hallow innocent days"
11550,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of peace and self-command. Of rivers, fields,"
11551,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And groves I speak to thee, my Friend! to thee,                    265"
11552,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Who, yet a liveried schoolboy, in the depths"
11553,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of the huge city, [W] on the leaded roof"
11554,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of that wide edifice, [X] thy school and home,"
11555,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Wert used to lie and gaze upon the clouds
11556,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Moving in heaven; or, of that pleasure tired,                      270"
11557,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To shut thine eyes, and by internal light"
11558,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"See trees, and meadows, and thy native stream, [Y]"
11559,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Far distant, thus beheld from year to year"
11560,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of a long exile. Nor could I forget,"
11561,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In this late portion of my argument,                               275"
11562,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That scarcely, as my term of pupilage"
11563,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Ceased, had I left those academic bowers"
11564,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,When thou wert thither guided. [Z] From the heart
11565,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of London, and from cloisters there, thou camest,"
11566,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And didst sit down in temperance and peace,                        280"
11567,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,A rigorous student. [a] What a stormy course
11568,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Then followed. [b] Oh! it is a pang that calls
11569,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"For utterance, to think what easy change"
11570,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of circumstances might to thee have spared
11571,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A world of pain, ripened a thousand hopes,                         285"
11572,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,For ever withered. Through this retrospect
11573,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of my collegiate life I still have had
11574,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Thy after-sojourn in the self-same place
11575,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Present before my eyes, have played with times"
11576,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And accidents as children do with cards,                           290"
11577,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Or as a man, who, when his house is built,"
11578,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A frame locked up in wood and stone, doth still,"
11579,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"As impotent fancy prompts, by his fireside,"
11580,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Rebuild it to his liking. I have thought
11581,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of thee, thy learning, gorgeous eloquence,                         295"
11582,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And all the strength and plumage of thy youth,"
11583,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Thy subtle speculations, toils abstruse"
11584,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Among the schoolmen, and Platonic forms"
11585,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of wild ideal pageantry, shaped out"
11586,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From things well-matched or ill, and words for things,             300"
11587,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The self-created sustenance of a mind
11588,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Debarred from Nature's living images,"
11589,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Compelled to be a life unto herself,"
11590,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And unrelentingly possessed by thirst
11591,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of greatness, love, and beauty. Not alone,                         305"
11592,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Ah! surely not in singleness of heart
11593,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Should I have seen the light of evening fade
11594,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From smooth Cam's silent waters: had we met,"
11595,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Even at that early time, needs must I trust"
11596,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In the belief, that my maturer age,                                310"
11597,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"My calmer habits, and more steady voice,"
11598,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Would with an influence benign have soothed,"
11599,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Or chased away, the airy wretchedness"
11600,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That battened on thy youth. But thou hast trod
11601,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A march of glory, which doth put to shame                          315"
11602,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"These vain regrets; health suffers in thee, else"
11603,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Such grief for thee would be the weakest thought
11604,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That ever harboured in the breast of man.
11605,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11606,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,A passing word erewhile did lightly touch
11607,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"On wanderings of my own, that now embraced                         320"
11608,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,With livelier hope a region wider far.
11609,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11610,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"When the third summer freed us from restraint,"
11611,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A youthful friend, he too a mountaineer, [c]"
11612,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Not slow to share my wishes, took his staff,"
11613,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And sallying forth, we journeyed side by side,                     325"
11614,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Bound to the distant Alps. [d] A hardy slight
11615,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Did this unprecedented course imply
11616,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of college studies and their set rewards;
11617,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Nor had, in truth, the scheme been formed by me"
11618,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Without uneasy forethought of the pain,                            330"
11619,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The censures, and ill-omening of those"
11620,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,To whom my worldly interests were dear.
11621,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"But Nature then was sovereign in my mind,"
11622,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And mighty forms, seizing a youthful fancy,"
11623,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Had given a charter to irregular hopes.                            335
11624,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,In any age of uneventful calm
11625,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Among the nations, surely would my heart"
11626,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Have been possessed by similar desire;
11627,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"But Europe at that time was thrilled with joy,"
11628,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"France standing on the top of golden hours, [e]                    340"
11629,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And human nature seeming born again. [f]
11630,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11631,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Lightly equipped, [g] and but a few brief looks"
11632,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Cast on the white cliffs of our native shore
11633,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From the receding vessel's deck, we chanced"
11634,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,To land at Calais on the very eve                                  345
11635,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of that great federal day; [h] and there we saw,"
11636,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In a mean city, and among a few,"
11637,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,How bright a face is worn when joy of one
11638,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Is joy for tens of millions. [h] Southward thence
11639,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"We held our way, direct through hamlets, towns, [i]                350"
11640,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Gaudy with reliques of that festival,"
11641,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Flowers left to wither on triumphal arcs,"
11642,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And window-garlands. On the public roads,"
11643,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And, once, three days successively, through paths"
11644,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"By which our toilsome journey was abridged, [k]                    355"
11645,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Among sequestered villages we walked
11646,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And found benevolence and blessedness
11647,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Spread like a fragrance everywhere, when spring"
11648,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Hath left no corner of the land untouched:
11649,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Where elms for many and many a league in files                     360
11650,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With their thin umbrage, on the stately roads"
11651,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of that great kingdom, rustled o'er our heads, [m]"
11652,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,For ever near us as we paced along:
11653,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"How sweet at such a time, with such delight"
11654,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"On every side, in prime of youthful strength,                      365"
11655,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,To feed a Poet's tender melancholy
11656,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And fond conceit of sadness, with the sound"
11657,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of undulations varying as might please
11658,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The wind that swayed them; once, and more than once,"
11659,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Unhoused beneath the evening star we saw                           370
11660,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Dances of liberty, and, in late hours"
11661,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of darkness, dances in the open air"
11662,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Deftly prolonged, though grey-haired lookers on"
11663,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Might waste their breath in chiding.
11664,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Under hills--
11665,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The vine-clad hills and slopes of Burgundy,                        375"
11666,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Upon the bosom of the gentle Saône
11667,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"We glided forward with the flowing stream, [n]"
11668,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Swift Rhone! thou wert the _wings_ on which we cut
11669,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,A winding passage with majestic ease
11670,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Between thy lofty rocks. [o] Enchanting show                       380
11671,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Those woods and farms and orchards did present
11672,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And single cottages and lurking towns,"
11673,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Reach after reach, succession without end"
11674,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of deep and stately vales! A lonely pair
11675,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of strangers, till day closed, we sailed along,                    385"
11676,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Clustered together with a merry crowd
11677,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of those emancipated, a blithe host"
11678,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of travellers, chiefly delegates returning"
11679,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,From the great spousals newly solemnised
11680,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"At their chief city, in the sight of Heaven.                       390"
11681,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Like bees they swarmed, gaudy and gay as bees;"
11682,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Some vapoured in the unruliness of joy,"
11683,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And with their swords flourished as if to fight
11684,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The saucy air. In this proud company
11685,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"We landed--took with them our evening meal,                        395"
11686,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Guests welcome almost as the angels were
11687,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To Abraham of old. The supper done,"
11688,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,With flowing cups elate and happy thoughts
11689,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"We rose at signal given, and formed a ring"
11690,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And, hand in hand, danced round and round the board;               400"
11691,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"All hearts were open, every tongue was loud"
11692,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,With amity and glee; we bore a name
11693,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Honoured in France, the name of Englishmen,"
11694,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And hospitably did they give us hail,"
11695,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,As their forerunners in a glorious course;                         405
11696,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And round and round the board we danced again.
11697,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,With these blithe friends our voyage we renewed
11698,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,At early dawn. The monastery bells
11699,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Made a sweet jingling in our youthful ears;
11700,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The rapid river flowing without noise,                             410"
11701,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And each uprising or receding spire
11702,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Spake with a sense of peace, at intervals"
11703,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Touching the heart amid the boisterous crew
11704,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,By whom we were encompassed. Taking leave
11705,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of this glad throng, foot-travellers side by side,                 415"
11706,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Measuring our steps in quiet, we pursued"
11707,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Our journey, and ere twice the sun had set"
11708,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Beheld the Convent of Chartreuse, and there"
11709,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Rested within an awful _solitude_: [p]
11710,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Yes, for even then no other than a place                           420"
11711,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of soul-affecting _solitude_ appeared
11712,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That far-famed region, though our eyes had seen,"
11713,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"As toward the sacred mansion we advanced,"
11714,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Arms flashing, and a military glare"
11715,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of riotous men commissioned to expel                               425
11716,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The blameless inmates, and belike subvert"
11717,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That frame of social being, which so long"
11718,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Had bodied forth the ghostliness of things
11719,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,In silence visible and perpetual calm.
11720,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11721,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"--""Stay, stay your sacrilegious hands!""--The voice                 430"
11722,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Was Nature's, uttered from her Alpine throne;"
11723,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,I heard it then and seem to hear it now--
11724,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"""Your impious work forbear, perish what may,"
11725,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Let this one temple last, be this one spot"
11726,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of earth devoted to eternity!""                                     435"

11728,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Waved their dark tops, not silent as they waved,"
11729,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And while below, along their several beds,"
11730,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Murmured the sister streams of Life and Death, [r]"
11731,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Thus by conflicting passions pressed, my heart                     440"
11732,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Responded; ""Honour to the patriot's zeal!"
11733,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Glory and hope to new-born Liberty!
11734,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Hail to the mighty projects of the time!
11735,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Discerning sword that Justice wields, do thou"
11736,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Go forth and prosper; and, ye purging fires,                       445"
11737,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Up to the loftiest towers of Pride ascend,"
11738,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Fanned by the breath of angry Providence.
11739,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"But oh! if Past and Future be the wings,"
11740,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,On whose support harmoniously conjoined
11741,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Moves the great spirit of human knowledge, spare                   450"
11742,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"These courts of mystery, where a step advanced"
11743,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Between the portals of the shadowy rocks
11744,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Leaves far behind life's treacherous vanities,"
11745,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,For penitential tears and trembling hopes
11746,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Exchanged--to equalise in God's pure sight                         455
11747,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Monarch and peasant: be the house redeemed
11748,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With its unworldly votaries, for the sake"
11749,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of conquest over sense, hourly achieved"
11750,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Through faith and meditative reason, resting"
11751,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Upon the word of heaven-imparted truth,                            460"
11752,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Calmly triumphant; and for humbler claim
11753,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of that imaginative impulse sent
11754,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From these majestic floods, yon shining cliffs,"
11755,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The untransmuted shapes of many worlds,"
11756,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Cerulean ether's pure inhabitants,                                 465"
11757,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"These forests unapproachable by death,"
11758,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That shall endure as long as man endures,"
11759,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To think, to hope, to worship, and to feel,"
11760,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To struggle, to be lost within himself"

11762,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To look with bodily eyes, and be consoled."""
11763,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Not seldom since that moment have I wished
11764,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That thou, O Friend! the trouble or the calm"
11765,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Hadst shared, when, from profane regards apart,"
11766,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,In sympathetic reverence we trod                                   475

11772,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Entering, [s] we fed the soul with darkness; thence"

11778,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Yet then, from the undiscriminating sweep"
11779,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And rage of one State-whirlwind, insecure."
11780,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,

11783,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A march it was of military speed, [u]"
11784,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And Earth did change her images and forms

11811,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of those deep haunts, an aboriginal vale,"
11812,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Quiet and lorded over and possessed                                520
11813,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"By naked huts, wood-built, and sown like tents"
11814,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Or Indian cabins over the fresh lawns
11815,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And by the river side.
11816,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11817,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That very day,"
11818,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,From a bare ridge [y] we also first beheld
11819,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Unveiled the summit of Mont Blanc, and grieved                     525"
11820,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,To have a soulless image on the eye
11821,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That had usurped upon a living thought
11822,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That never more could be. The wondrous Vale
11823,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of Chamouny stretched far below, and soon"
11824,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With its dumb cataracts and streams of ice,                        530"
11825,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A motionless array of mighty waves,"
11826,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Five rivers broad and vast, [z] made rich amends,"
11827,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And reconciled us to realities;
11828,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"There small birds warble from the leafy trees,"
11829,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The eagle soars high in the element,                               535"
11830,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"There doth the reaper bind the yellow sheaf,"
11831,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The maiden spread the haycock in the sun,"
11832,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"While Winter like a well-tamed lion walks,"
11833,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Descending from the mountain to make sport
11834,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Among the cottages by beds of flowers.                             540
11835,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11836,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Whate'er in this wide circuit we beheld,"
11837,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Or heard, was fitted to our unripe state"
11838,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of intellect and heart. With such a book
11839,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Before our eyes, we could not choose but read"
11840,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Lessons of genuine brotherhood, the plain                          545"
11841,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And universal reason of mankind,"
11842,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The truths of young and old. Nor, side by side"
11843,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Pacing, two social pilgrims, or alone"
11844,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Each with his humour, could we fail to abound"
11845,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In dreams and fictions, pensively composed:                        550"
11846,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Dejection taken up for pleasure's sake,"
11847,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And gilded sympathies, the willow wreath,"
11848,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And sober posies of funereal flowers,"
11849,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Gathered among those solitudes sublime
11850,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From formal gardens of the lady Sorrow,                            555"
11851,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Did sweeten many a meditative hour.
11852,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11853,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Yet still in me with those soft luxuries
11854,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Mixed something of stem mood, an under-thirst"
11855,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of vigour seldom utterly allayed.
11856,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And from that source how different a sadness                       560
11857,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Would issue, let one incident make known."
11858,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"When from the Vallais we had turned, and clomb"
11859,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Along the Simplon's steep and rugged road, [Aa]"
11860,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Following a band of muleteers, we reached"
11861,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A halting-place, where all together took                           565"
11862,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Their noon-tide meal. Hastily rose our guide,"
11863,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Leaving us at the board; awhile we lingered,"
11864,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Then paced the beaten downward way that led
11865,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Right to a rough stream's edge, and there broke off;"
11866,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The only track now visible was one                                 570
11867,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That from the torrent's further brink held forth
11868,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Conspicuous invitation to ascend
11869,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,A lofty mountain. After brief delay
11870,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Crossing the unbridged stream, that road we took,"
11871,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And clomb with eagerness, till anxious fears                       575"
11872,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Intruded, for we failed to overtake"
11873,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Our comrades gone before. By fortunate chance,"
11874,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"While every moment added doubt to doubt,"
11875,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A peasant met us, from whose mouth we learned"
11876,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That to the spot which had perplexed us first                      580
11877,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"We must descend, and there should find the road,"
11878,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Which in the stony channel of the stream
11879,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Lay a few steps, and then along its banks;"
11880,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And, that our future course, all plain to sight,"
11881,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Was downwards, with the current of that stream.                    585"
11882,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Loth to believe what we so grieved to hear,"
11883,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"For still we had hopes that pointed to the clouds,"
11884,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"We questioned him again, and yet again;"
11885,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,But every word that from the peasant's lips
11886,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Came in reply, translated by our feelings,                         590"
11887,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Ended in this,--'that we had crossed the Alps'."
11888,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11889,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Imagination--here the Power so called
11890,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Through sad incompetence of human speech,"
11891,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That awful Power rose from the mind's abyss
11892,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Like an unfathered vapour that enwraps,                            595"
11893,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"At once, some lonely traveller. I was lost;"
11894,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Halted without an effort to break through;
11895,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,But to my conscious soul I now can say--
11896,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"""I recognise thy glory:"" in such strength"
11897,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of usurpation, when the light of sense                             600"
11898,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Goes out, but with a flash that has revealed"
11899,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The invisible world, doth greatness make abode,"
11900,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"There harbours; whether we be young or old,"
11901,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Our destiny, our being's heart and home,"
11902,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Is with infinitude, and only there;                                605"
11903,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With hope it is, hope that can never die,"
11904,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Effort, and expectation, and desire,"
11905,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And something evermore about to be.
11906,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Under such banners militant, the soul"
11907,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Seeks for no trophies, struggles for no spoils                     610"
11908,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That may attest her prowess, blest in thoughts"
11909,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That are their own perfection and reward,"
11910,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Strong in herself and in beatitude
11911,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That hides her, like the mighty flood of Nile"
11912,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Poured from his fount of Abyssinian clouds                         615
11913,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,To fertilise the whole Egyptian plain.
11914,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11915,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The melancholy slackening that ensued
11916,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Upon those tidings by the peasant given
11917,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Was soon dislodged. Downwards we hurried fast,"
11918,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And, with the half-shaped road which we had missed,                620"
11919,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Entered a narrow chasm. The brook and road [1]
11920,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy strait, [Bb]"
11921,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And with them did we journey several hours
11922,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,At a slow pace. [2] The immeasurable height
11923,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of woods decaying, never to be decayed,                            625"
11924,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The stationary blasts of waterfalls,"
11925,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,And in the narrow rent at every turn
11926,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Winds thwarting winds, bewildered and forlorn,"
11927,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,"
11928,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,                       630"
11929,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Black drizzling crags that spake by the way-side
11930,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"As if a voice were in them, the sick sight"
11931,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And giddy prospect of the raving stream,"
11932,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The unfettered clouds and region of the Heavens,"
11933,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light--635"
11934,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Were all like workings of one mind, the features"
11935,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree;"
11936,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Characters of the great Apocalypse,"
11937,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The types and symbols of Eternity,"
11938,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of first, and last, and midst, and without end.                    640"
11939,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11940,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That night our lodging was a house that stood
11941,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Alone within the valley, at a point"
11942,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Where, tumbling from aloft, a torrent swelled"
11943,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The rapid stream whose margin we had trod;
11944,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A dreary mansion, large beyond all need, [Cc]                      645"
11945,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With high and spacious rooms, deafened and stunned"
11946,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"By noise of waters, making innocent sleep"
11947,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Lie melancholy among weary bones.
11948,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11949,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Uprisen betimes, our journey we renewed,"
11950,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Led by the stream, ere noon-day magnified                          650"
11951,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Into a lordly river, broad and deep,"
11952,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Dimpling along in silent majesty,"
11953,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With mountains for its neighbours, and in view"
11954,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of distant mountains and their snowy tops,"
11955,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And thus proceeding to Locarno's Lake, [Dd]                        655"
11956,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Fit resting-place for such a visitant.
11957,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Locarno! spreading out in width like Heaven,"
11958,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"How dost thou cleave to the poetic heart,"
11959,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Bask in the sunshine of the memory;
11960,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And Como! thou, a treasure whom the earth                          660"
11961,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Keeps to herself, confined as in a depth"
11962,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of Abyssinian privacy. I spake
11963,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of thee, thy chestnut woods, [Ee] and garden plots"
11964,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of Indian corn tended by dark-eyed maids;
11965,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roofed with vines,                  665"
11966,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Winding from house to house, from town to town,"
11967,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Sole link that binds them to each other; [Ff] walks,"
11968,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"League after league, and cloistral avenues,"
11969,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Where silence dwells if music be not there:
11970,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"While yet a youth undisciplined in verse,                          670"
11971,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Through fond ambition of that hour I strove
11972,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,To chant your praise; [Gg] nor can approach you now
11973,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Ungreeted by a more melodious Song,"
11974,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Where tones of Nature smoothed by learned Art
11975,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,May flow in lasting current. Like a breeze                         675
11976,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Or sunbeam over your domain I passed
11977,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,In motion without pause; but ye have left
11978,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Your beauty with me, a serene accord"
11979,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of forms and colours, passive, yet endowed"
11980,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,In their submissiveness with power as sweet                        680
11981,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And gracious, almost might I dare to say,"
11982,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"As virtue is, or goodness; sweet as love,"
11983,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Or the remembrance of a generous deed,"
11984,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Or mildest visitations of pure thought,"
11985,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"When God, the giver of all joy, is thanked                         685"
11986,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Religiously, in silent blessedness;"
11987,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Sweet as this last herself, for such it is."
11988,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
11989,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With those delightful pathways we advanced,"
11990,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"For two days' space, in presence of the Lake,"
11991,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That, stretching far among the Alps, assumed                       690"
11992,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A character more stern. The second night,"
11993,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From sleep awakened, and misled by sound"
11994,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of the church clock telling the hours with strokes
11995,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Whose import then we had not learned, we rose"
11996,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"By moonlight, doubting not that day was nigh,                      695"
11997,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And that meanwhile, by no uncertain path,"
11998,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Along the winding margin of the lake,"
11999,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Led, as before, we should behold the scene"
12000,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Hushed in profound repose. We left the town
12001,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of Gravedona [Hh] with this hope; but soon                         700
12002,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Were lost, bewildered among woods immense,"
12003,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And on a rock sate down, to wait for day."
12004,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"An open place it was, and overlooked,"
12005,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"From high, the sullen water far beneath,"
12006,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,On which a dull red image of the moon                              705
12007,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Lay bedded, changing oftentimes its form"
12008,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Like an uneasy snake. From hour to hour
12009,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"We sate and sate, wondering, as if the night"
12010,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Had been ensnared by witchcraft. On the rock
12011,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"At last we stretched our weary limbs for sleep,                    710"
12012,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"But _could not_ sleep, tormented by the stings"
12013,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of insects, which, with noise like that of noon,"
12014,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Filled all the woods; the cry of unknown birds;
12015,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The mountains more by blackness visible
12016,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And their own size, than any outward light;                        715"
12017,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,The breathless wilderness of clouds; the clock
12018,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That told, with unintelligible voice,"
12019,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"The widely parted hours; the noise of streams,"
12020,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And sometimes rustling motions nigh at hand,"
12021,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,That did not leave us free from personal fear;                     720
12022,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"And, lastly, the withdrawing moon, that set"
12023,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Before us, while she still was high in heaven;--"
12024,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,These were our food; and such a summer's night [Ii]
12025,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Followed that pair of golden days that shed
12026,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"On Como's Lake, and all that round it lay,                         725"
12027,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Their fairest, softest, happiest influence."
12028,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
12029,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"But here I must break off, and bid farewell"
12030,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To days, each offering some new sight, or fraught"
12031,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"With some untried adventure, in a course"
12032,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Prolonged till sprinklings of autumnal snow                        730
12033,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Checked our unwearied steps. Let this alone
12034,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Be mentioned as a parting word, that not"
12035,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In hollow exultation, dealing out"
12036,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Hyperboles of praise comparative;
12037,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Not rich one moment to be poor for ever;                           735
12038,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Not prostrate, overborne, as if the mind"
12039,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Herself were nothing, a mere pensioner"
12040,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,On outward forms--did we in presence stand
12041,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of that magnificent region. On the front
12042,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Of this whole Song is written that my heart                        740
12043,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Must, in such Temple, needs have offered up"
12044,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A different worship. Finally, whate'er"
12045,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"I saw, or heard, or felt, was but a stream"
12046,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"That flowed into a kindred stream; a gale,"
12047,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Confederate with the current of the soul,                          745"
12048,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To speed my voyage; every sound or sight,"
12049,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"In its degree of power, administered"
12050,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"To grandeur or to tenderness,--to the one"
12051,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Directly, but to tender thoughts by means"
12052,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Less often instantaneous in effect;                                750
12053,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Led me to these by paths that, in the main,"
12054,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Were more circuitous, but not less sure"
12055,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Duly to reach the point marked out by Heaven.
12056,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,
12057,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Oh, most belovèd Friend! a glorious time,"
12058,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,A happy time that was; triumphant looks                            755
12059,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Were then the common language of all eyes;
12060,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"As if awaked from sleep, the Nations hailed"
12061,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,Their great expectancy: the fife of war
12062,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Was then a spirit-stirring sound indeed,"
12063,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,A black-bird's whistle in a budding grove.                         760
12064,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,We left the Swiss exulting in the fate
12065,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of their near neighbours; and, when shortening fast"
12066,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Our pilgrimage, nor distant far from home,"
12067,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,We crossed the Brabant armies on the fret [Kk]
12068,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,For battle in the cause of Liberty.                                765
12069,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"A stripling, scarcely of the household then"
12070,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"Of social life, I looked upon these things"
12071,CAMBRIDGE AND THE ALPS,"As from a distance; heard, and saw, and felt,"

12541,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Six changeful years have vanished since I first
12542,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze
12543,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Which met me issuing from the City's [A] walls)
12544,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,A glad preamble to this Verse: [B] I sang
12545,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Aloud, with fervour irresistible                                     5"
12546,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,"
12547,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side"
12548,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth
12549,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"(So willed the Muse) a less impetuous stream,"
12550,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"That flowed awhile with unabating strength,                         10"
12551,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Then stopped for years; not audible again
12552,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Before last primrose-time, [C] Beloved Friend!"
12553,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The assurance which then cheered some heavy thoughts
12554,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,On thy departure to a foreign land [D]
12555,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Has failed; too slowly moves the promised work.                     15

12576,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Through a thick forest. Silence touched me here
12577,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,No less than sound had done before; the child

12590,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Which we will now resume with lively hope,"

12592,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"That lies before us, needful to be told."
12593,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,

12641,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"In look and air, from that new region brought,"
12642,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,As if from Fairy-land. Much I questioned him;
12643,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And every word he uttered, on my ears"
12644,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Fell flatter than a cagèd parrot's note,                           100"
12645,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"That answers unexpectedly awry,"
12646,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And mocks the prompter's listening. Marvellous things

12739,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Some half-frequented scene, where wider streets"
12740,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Bring straggling breezes of suburban air.
12741,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Here files of ballads dangle from dead walls;
12742,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Advertisements, of giant-size, from high"
12743,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Press forward, in all colours, on the sight;                       195"
12744,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"These, bold in conscious merit, lower down;"
12745,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"_That_, fronted with a most imposing word,"
12746,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Is, peradventure, one in masquerade."
12747,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"As on the broadening causeway we advance,"
12748,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Behold, turned upwards, a face hard and strong                     200"
12749,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"In lineaments, and red with over-toil."
12750,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,'Tis one encountered here and everywhere;
12751,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"A travelling cripple, by the trunk cut short,"
12752,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And stumping on his arms. In sailor's garb
12753,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Another lies at length, beside a range                             205"
12754,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of well-formed characters, with chalk inscribed"

12757,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The military Idler, and the Dame,"

12766,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The Jew; the stately and slow-moving Turk,"
12767,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,With freight of slippers piled beneath his arm!
12768,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
12769,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Enough;--the mighty concourse I surveyed
12770,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"With no unthinking mind, well pleased to note                      220"
12771,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Among the crowd all specimens of man,"

12776,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"America, the Hunter-Indian; Moors,"
12777,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Malays, Lascars, the Tartar, the Chinese,"
12778,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns.
12779,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
12780,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"At leisure, then, I viewed, from day to day,"
12781,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The spectacles within doors,--birds and beasts                     230"
12782,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of every nature, and strange plants convened"
12783,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"From every clime; and, next, those sights that ape"

12785,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Expressing, as in mirror, sea and land,"

12813,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Others of wider scope, where living men,"
12814,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Music, and shifting pantomimic scenes,"
12815,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Diversified the allurement. Need I fear
12816,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"To mention by its name, as in degree,"
12817,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Lowest of these and humblest in attempt,                           265"
12818,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Yet richly graced with honours of her own,"
12819,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Half-rural Sadler's Wells? [Q] Though at that time

12845,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Shipwreck, or some domestic incident"

12849,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"I mean, O distant Friend! a story drawn"
12850,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"From our own ground,--the Maid of Buttermere,--[T]"
12851,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And how, unfaithful to a virtuous wife"
12852,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Deserted and deceived, the spoiler came"

12854,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And wedded her, in cruel mockery"
12855,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Of love and marriage bonds. [U] These words to thee
12856,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Must needs bring back the moment when we first,"
12857,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Ere the broad world rang with the maiden's name,"
12858,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Beheld her serving at the cottage inn,                             305"
12859,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Both stricken, as she entered or withdrew,"
12860,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,With admiration of her modest mien
12861,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And carriage, marked by unexampled grace."
12862,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,We since that time not unfamiliarly
12863,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Have seen her,--her discretion have observed,                      310"
12864,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Her just opinions, delicate reserve,"
12865,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Her patience, and humility of mind"
12866,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Unspoiled by commendation and the excess
12867,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Of public notice--an offensive light
12868,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,To a meek spirit suffering inwardly.                               315
12869,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
12870,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,From this memorial tribute to my theme
12871,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"I was returning, when, with sundry forms"
12872,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Commingled--shapes which met me in the way
12873,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"That we must tread--thy image rose again,"
12874,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Maiden of Buttermere! She lives in peace                           320
12875,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Upon the spot where she was born and reared;
12876,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Without contamination doth she live
12877,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"In quietness, without anxiety:"
12878,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Beside the mountain chapel, sleeps in earth"
12879,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Her new-born infant, fearless as a lamb                            325"
12880,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"That, thither driven from some unsheltered place,"
12881,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Rests underneath the little rock-like pile
12882,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,When storms are raging. Happy are they both--
12883,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Mother and child!--These feelings, in themselves"
12884,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Trite, do yet scarcely seem so when I think                        330"
12885,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,On those ingenuous moments of our youth
12886,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Ere we have learnt by use to slight the crimes
12887,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And sorrows of the world. Those simple days
12888,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Are now my theme; and, foremost of the scenes,"
12889,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Which yet survive in memory, appears                               335"
12890,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"One, at whose centre sate a lovely Boy,"
12891,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"A sportive infant, who, for six months' space,"
12892,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Not more, had been of age to deal about"
12893,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Articulate prattle--Child as beautiful
12894,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"As ever clung around a mother's neck,                              340"
12895,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Or father fondly gazed upon with pride.
12896,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"There, too, conspicuous for stature tall"
12897,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And large dark eyes, beside her infant stood"
12898,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The mother; but, upon her cheeks diffused,"
12899,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,False tints too well accorded with the glare                       345
12900,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,From play-house lustres thrown without reserve
12901,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,On every object near. The Boy had been
12902,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The pride and pleasure of all lookers-on
12903,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"In whatsoever place, but seemed in this"
12904,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,A sort of alien scattered from the clouds.                         350
12905,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of lusty vigour, more than infantine"
12906,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"He was in limb, in cheek a summer rose"
12907,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Just three parts blown--a cottage-child--if e'er,"
12908,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"By cottage-door on breezy mountain side,"
12909,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Or in some sheltering vale, was seen a babe                        355"
12910,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,By Nature's gifts so favoured. Upon a board
12911,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Decked with refreshments had this child been placed,"
12912,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"_His_ little stage in the vast theatre,"
12913,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And there he sate surrounded with a throng
12914,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of chance spectators, chiefly dissolute men                        360"
12915,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And shameless women, treated and caressed;"
12916,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Ate, drank, and with the fruit and glasses played,"
12917,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,While oaths and laughter and indecent speech
12918,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Were rife about him as the songs of birds
12919,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Contending after showers. The mother now                           365
12920,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Is fading out of memory, but I see"
12921,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The lovely Boy as I beheld him then
12922,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Among the wretched and the falsely gay,"
12923,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Like one of those who walked with hair unsinged
12924,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Amid the fiery furnace. Charms and spells                          370
12925,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Muttered on black and spiteful instigation
12926,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Have stopped, as some believe, the kindliest growths."
12927,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Ah, with how different spirit might a prayer"
12928,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Have been preferred, that this fair creature, checked"
12929,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"By special privilege of Nature's love,                             375"
12930,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Should in his childhood be detained for ever!
12931,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,But with its universal freight the tide
12932,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Hath rolled along, and this bright innocent,"
12933,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Mary! may now have lived till he could look
12934,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"With envy on thy nameless babe that sleeps,                        380"
12935,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Beside the mountain chapel, undisturbed."
12936,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
12937,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Four rapid years had scarcely then been told [V]
12938,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Since, travelling southward from our pastoral hills,"
12939,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"I heard, and for the first time in my life,"
12940,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The voice of woman utter blasphemy--385
12941,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Saw woman as she is, to open shame"
12942,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Abandoned, and the pride of public vice;"
12943,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"I shuddered, for a barrier seemed at once"
12944,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Thrown in, that from humanity divorced"
12945,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Humanity, splitting the race of man                                390"
12946,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"In twain, yet leaving the same outward form."
12947,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Distress of mind ensued upon the sight
12948,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And ardent meditation. Later years
12949,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Brought to such spectacle a milder sadness.
12950,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Feelings of pure commiseration, grief                              395"
12951,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,For the individual and the overthrow
12952,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Of her soul's beauty; farther I was then
12953,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"But seldom led, or wished to go; in truth"
12954,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The sorrow of the passion stopped me there.
12955,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
12956,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"But let me now, less moved, in order take                          400"
12957,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Our argument. Enough is said to show
12958,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"How casual incidents of real life,"
12959,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Observed where pastime only had been sought,"
12960,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Outweighed, or put to flight, the set events"
12961,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And measured passions of the stage, albeit                         405"
12962,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,By Siddons trod in the fulness of her power.
12963,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Yet was the theatre my dear delight;
12964,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The very gilding, lamps and painted scrolls,"
12965,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And all the mean upholstery of the place,"
12966,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Wanted not animation, when the tide                                410"
12967,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Of pleasure ebbed but to return as fast
12968,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"With the ever-shifting figures of the scene,"
12969,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Solemn or gay: whether some beauteous dame
12970,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Advanced in radiance through a deep recess
12971,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of thick entangled forest, like the moon                           415"
12972,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Opening the clouds; or sovereign king, announced"
12973,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"With flourishing trumpet, came in full-blown state"
12974,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of the world's greatness, winding round with train"
12975,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of courtiers, banners, and a length of guards;"
12976,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Or captive led in abject weeds, and jingling                       420"
12977,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,His slender manacles; or romping girl
12978,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Bounced, leapt, and pawed the air; or mumbling sire,"
12979,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,A scare-crow pattern of old age dressed up
12980,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,In all the tatters of infirmity
12981,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"All loosely put together, hobbled in,                              425"
12982,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Stumping upon a cane with which he smites,"
12983,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"From time to time, the solid boards, and makes them"
12984,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Prate somewhat loudly of the whereabout [W]
12985,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Of one so overloaded with his years.
12986,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"But what of this! the laugh, the grin, grimace,                    430"
12987,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The antics striving to outstrip each other,"
12988,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Were all received, the least of them not lost,"
12989,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"With an unmeasured welcome. Through the night,"
12990,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Between the show, and many-headed mass"
12991,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of the spectators, and each several nook                           435"
12992,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Filled with its fray or brawl, how eagerly"
12993,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And with what flashes, as it were, the mind"
12994,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Turned this way--that way! sportive and alert
12995,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And watchful, as a kitten when at play,"
12996,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"While winds are eddying round her, among straws                    440"
12997,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And rustling leaves. Enchanting age and sweet!
12998,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Romantic almost, looked at through a space,"
12999,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"How small, of intervening years! For then,"
13000,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Though surely no mean progress had been made
13001,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"In meditations holy and sublime,                                   445"
13002,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Yet something of a girlish child-like gloss
13003,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Of novelty survived for scenes like these;
13004,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Enjoyment haply handed down from times
13005,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"When at a country-playhouse, some rude barn"
13006,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Tricked out for that proud use, if I perchance                     450"
13007,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Caught, on a summer evening through a chink"
13008,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"In the old wall, an unexpected glimpse"
13009,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of daylight, the bare thought of where I was"
13010,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Gladdened me more than if I had been led
13011,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Into a dazzling cavern of romance,                                 455"
13012,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Crowded with Genii busy among works
13013,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Not to be looked at by the common sun.
13014,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
13015,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The matter that detains us now may seem,"
13016,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"To many, neither dignified enough"
13017,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Nor arduous, yet will not be scorned by them,                      460"
13018,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Who, looking inward, have observed the ties"
13019,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,That bind the perishable hours of life
13020,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Each to the other, and the curious props"
13021,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,By which the world of memory and thought
13022,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Exists and is sustained. More lofty themes,                        465"
13023,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Such as at least do wear a prouder face,"
13024,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Solicit our regard; but when I think
13025,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of these, I feel the imaginative power"
13026,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Languish within me; even then it slept,"
13027,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"When, pressed by tragic sufferings, the heart                      470"
13028,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Was more than full; amid my sobs and tears
13029,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"It slept, even in the pregnant season of youth."
13030,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,For though I was most passionately moved
13031,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And yielded to all changes of the scene
13032,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"With an obsequious promptness, yet the storm                       475"
13033,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Passed not beyond the suburbs of the mind;
13034,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Save when realities of act and mien,"
13035,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The incarnation of the spirits that move
13036,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"In harmony amid the Poet's world,"
13037,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Rose to ideal grandeur, or, called forth                           480"
13038,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"By power of contrast, made me recognise,"
13039,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"As at a glance, the things which I had shaped,"
13040,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And yet not shaped, had seen and scarcely seen,"
13041,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"When, having closed the mighty Shakespeare's page,"
13042,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"I mused, and thought, and felt, in solitude.                       485"
13043,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
13044,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Pass we from entertainments, that are such"
13045,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Professedly, to others titled higher,"
13046,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Yet, in the estimate of youth at least,"
13047,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"More near akin to those than names imply,--"
13048,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,I mean the brawls of lawyers in their courts                       490
13049,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Before the ermined judge, or that great stage [X]"
13050,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Where senators, tongue-favoured men, perform,"
13051,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Admired and envied. Oh! the beating heart,"
13052,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"When one among the prime of these rose up,--"
13053,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"One, of whose name from childhood we had heard                     495"
13054,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Familiarly, a household term, like those,"
13055,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The Bedfords, Glosters, Salsburys, of old"
13056,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Whom the fifth Harry talks of. [Y] Silence! hush!
13057,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"This is no trifler, no short-flighted wit,"
13058,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"No stammerer of a minute, painfully                                500"
13059,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Delivered. No! the Orator hath yoked
13060,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The Hours, like young Aurora, to his car:"
13061,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Thrice welcome Presence! how can patience e'er
13062,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Grow weary of attending on a track
13063,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"That kindles with such glory! All are charmed,                     505"
13064,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Astonished; like a hero in romance,"
13065,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,He winds away his never-ending horn;
13066,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Words follow words, sense seems to follow sense:"
13067,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,What memory and what logic! till the strain
13068,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Transcendent, superhuman as it seemed,                             510"
13069,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Grows tedious even in a young man's ear.
13070,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
13071,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Genius of Burke! forgive the pen seduced
13072,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"By specious wonders, and too slow to tell"
13073,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of what the ingenuous, what bewildered men,"
13074,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Beginning to mistrust their boastful guides,                       515"
13075,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And wise men, willing to grow wiser, caught,"
13076,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Rapt auditors! from thy most eloquent tongue--
13077,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Now mute, for ever mute in the cold grave."
13078,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"I see him,--old, but Vigorous in age,--"
13079,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Stand like an oak whose stag-horn branches start                   520
13080,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Out of its leafy brow, the more to awe"
13081,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The younger brethren of the grove. But some--
13082,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"While he forewarns, denounces, launches forth,"
13083,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Against all systems built on abstract rights,"
13084,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Keen ridicule; the majesty proclaims                               525
13085,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of Institutes and Laws, hallowed by time;"
13086,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Declares the vital power of social ties

13088,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Exploding upstart Theory, insists"
13089,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Upon the allegiance to which men are born--530
13090,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Some--say at once a froward multitude--
13091,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Murmur (for truth is hated, where not loved)"
13092,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"As the winds fret within the Æolian cave,"
13093,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Galled by their monarch's chain. The times were big
13094,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"With ominous change, which, night by night, provoked               535"
13095,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Keen struggles, and black clouds of passion raised;"
13096,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"But memorable moments intervened,"
13097,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"When Wisdom, like the Goddess from Jove's brain,"
13098,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Broke forth in armour of resplendent words,"
13099,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Startling the Synod. Could a youth, and one                        540"

13101,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Under the weight of classic eloquence,"
13102,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Sit, see, and hear, unthankful, uninspired?"
13103,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
13104,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Nor did the Pulpit's oratory fail

13106,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Were its admonishments, nor lightly heard"
13107,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The awful truths delivered thence by tongues
13108,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Endowed with various power to search the soul;
13109,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Yet ostentation, domineering, oft"
13110,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Poured forth harangues, how sadly out of place!--550"
13111,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"There have I seen a comely bachelor,"

13114,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And, in a tone elaborately low"
13115,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Beginning, lead his voice through many a maze                      555"
13116,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"A minuet course; and, winding up his mouth,"
13117,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"From time to time, into an orifice"

13140,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Extravagance in gesture, mien, and dress,"
13141,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And all the strife of singularity,                                 580"
13142,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Lies to the ear, and lies to every sense--"
13143,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of these, and of the living shapes they wear,"
13144,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"There is no end. Such candidates for regard,"
13145,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Although well pleased to be where they were found,"
13146,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"I did not hunt after, nor greatly prize,                           585"
13147,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Nor made unto myself a secret boast
13148,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Of reading them with quick and curious eye;
13149,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"But, as a common produce, things that are"
13150,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"To-day, to-morrow will be, took of them"
13151,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Such willing note, as, on some errand bound                        590"

13163,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Or tenderness, which there, set off by foil,"
13164,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Appeared more touching. One will I select;
13165,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,A Father--for he bore that sacred name--
13166,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Him saw I, sitting in an open square,"
13167,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Upon a corner-stone of that low wall,                              605"
13168,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Wherein were fixed the iron pales that fenced
13169,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"A spacious grass-plot; there, in silence, sate"
13170,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"This One Man, with a sickly babe outstretched"
13171,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Upon his knee, whom he had thither brought"
13172,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"For sunshine, and to breathe the fresher air.                      610"
13173,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of those who passed, and me who looked at him,"
13174,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,He took no heed; but in his brawny arms
13175,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"(The Artificer was to the elbow bare,"
13176,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And from his work this moment had been stolen)
13177,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"He held the child, and, bending over it,                           615"
13178,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,As if he were afraid both of the sun
13179,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And of the air, which he had come to seek,"
13180,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Eyed the poor babe with love unutterable.
13181,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
13182,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,As the black storm upon the mountain top
13183,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Sets off the sunbeam in the valley, so                             620"
13184,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,That huge fermenting mass of human-kind
13185,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Serves as a solemn back-ground, or relief,"
13186,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"To single forms and objects, whence they draw,"
13187,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"For feeling and contemplative regard,"
13188,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,More than inherent liveliness and power.                           625
13189,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"How oft, amid those overflowing streets,"
13190,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Have I gone forward with the crowd, and said"
13191,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Unto myself, ""The face of every one"
13192,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"That passes by me is a mystery!"""
13193,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Thus have I looked, nor ceased to look, oppressed                  630"
13194,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"By thoughts of what and whither, when and how,"
13195,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Until the shapes before my eyes became
13196,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"A second-sight procession, such as glides"
13197,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Over still mountains, or appears in dreams;"
13198,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And once, far-travelled in such mood, beyond                       635"
13199,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The reach of common indication, lost"
13200,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Amid the moving pageant, I was smitten"
13201,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Abruptly, with the view (a sight not rare)"
13202,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of a blind Beggar, who, with upright face,"
13203,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Stood, propped against a wall, upon his chest                      640"
13204,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Wearing a written paper, to explain"
13205,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"His story, whence he came, and who he was."
13206,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Caught by the spectacle my mind turned round
13207,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,As with the might of waters; an apt type
13208,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"This label seemed of the utmost we can know,                       645"
13209,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Both of ourselves and of the universe;
13210,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And, on the shape of that unmoving man,"
13211,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"His steadfast face and sightless eyes, I gazed,"
13212,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,As if admonished from another world.
13213,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,
13214,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Though reared upon the base of outward things,                   650"
13215,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Structures like these the excited spirit mainly
13216,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Builds for herself; scenes different there are,"
13217,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Full-formed, that take, with small internal help,"
13218,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Possession of the faculties,--the peace"
13219,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,That comes with night; the deep solemnity                          655
13220,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of nature's intermediate hours of rest,"
13221,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,When the great tide of human life stands still;
13222,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The business of the day to come, unborn,"
13223,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of that gone by, locked up, as in the grave;"
13224,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The blended calmness of the heavens and earth,                     660"
13225,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Moonlight and stars, and empty streets, and sounds"
13226,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Unfrequent as in deserts; at late hours
13227,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of winter evenings, when unwholesome rains"
13228,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Are falling hard, with people yet astir,"
13229,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The feeble salutation from the voice                               665
13230,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of some unhappy woman, now and then"
13231,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Heard as we pass, when no one looks about,"
13232,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Nothing is listened to. But these, I fear,"
13233,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Are falsely catalogued; things that are, are not,"
13234,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"As the mind answers to them, or the heart                          670"
13235,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Is prompt, or slow, to feel. What say you, then,"
13236,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"To times, when half the city shall break out"
13237,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Full of one passion, vengeance, rage, or fear?"
13238,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"To executions, to a street on fire,"
13239,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Mobs, riots, or rejoicings? From these sights                      675"
13240,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Take one,--that ancient festival, the Fair,"
13241,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Holden where martyrs suffered in past time,"
13242,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And named of St. Bartholomew; [c] there, see"
13243,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"A work completed to our hands, that lays,"
13244,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"If any spectacle on earth can do,                                  680"
13245,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,The whole creative powers of man asleep!--
13246,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"For once, the Muse's help will we implore,"
13247,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And she shall lodge us, wafted on her wings,"
13248,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Above the press and danger of the crowd,"
13249,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Upon some showman's platform. What a shock                         685
13250,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"For eyes and ears! what anarchy and din,"
13251,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Barbarian and infernal,--a phantasma,"
13252,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Monstrous in colour, motion, shape, sight, sound!"
13253,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Below, the open space, through every nook"
13254,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of the wide area, twinkles, is alive                               690"
13255,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"With heads; the midway region, and above,"
13256,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Is thronged with staring pictures and huge scrolls,"
13257,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Dumb proclamations of the Prodigies;

13259,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,And children whirling in their roundabouts;                        695
13260,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"With those that stretch the neck and strain the eyes,"
13261,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And crack the voice in rivalship, the crowd"
13262,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,Inviting; with buffoons against buffoons
13263,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Grimacing, writhing, screaming,--him who grinds"
13264,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The hurdy-gurdy, at the fiddle weaves,                             700"
13265,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Rattles the salt-box, thumps the kettle-drum,"
13266,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"And him who at the trumpet puffs his cheeks,"
13267,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"The silver-collared Negro with his timbrel,"
13268,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Equestrians, tumblers, women, girls, and boys,"
13269,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Blue-breeched, pink-vested, with high-towering plumes.--705"

13280,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Of man, his dullness, madness, and their feats"
13281,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"All jumbled up together, to compose"
13282,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,A Parliament of Monsters. Tents and Booths
13283,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Meanwhile, as if the whole were one vast mill,"
13284,RESIDENCE IN LONDON,"Are vomiting, receiving on all sides,                              720"

13807,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"His form hath flashed upon me, glorified"
13808,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,By the deep radiance of the setting sun:                           270
13809,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Or him have I descried in distant sky,"
13810,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"A solitary object and sublime,"
13811,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Above all height! like an aerial cross
13812,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Stationed alone upon a spiry rock
13813,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of the Chartreuse, for worship. [Y] Thus was man                   275"
13814,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Ennobled outwardly before my sight,"
13815,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,And thus my heart was early introduced
13816,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,To an unconscious love and reverence
13817,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Of human nature; hence the human form
13818,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"To me became an index of delight,                                  280"
13819,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of grace and honour, power and worthiness."
13820,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Meanwhile this creature--spiritual almost
13821,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"As those of books, but more exalted far;"
13822,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Far more of an imaginative form
13823,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Than the gay Corin of the groves, [Z] who lives                    285"
13824,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"For his own fancies, or to dance by the hour,"
13825,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"In coronal, with Phyllis in the midst--[Z]"
13826,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Was, for the purposes of kind, a man"
13827,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"With the most common; husband, father; learned,"
13828,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Could teach, admonish; suffered with the rest                      290"
13829,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"From vice and folly, wretchedness and fear;"
13830,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of this I little saw, cared less for it,"
13831,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,But something must have felt.
13832,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Call ye these appearances
13833,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Which I beheld of shepherds in my youth,"
13834,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"This sanctity of Nature given to man,                              295"
13835,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"A shadow, a delusion? ye who pore"
13836,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"On the dead letter, miss the spirit of things;"
13837,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Whose truth is not a motion or a shape
13838,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Instinct with vital functions, but a block"
13839,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Or waxen image which yourselves have made,                         300"
13840,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,And ye adore! But blessed be the God
13841,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Of Nature and of Man that this was so;
13842,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,That men before my inexperienced eyes
13843,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Did first present themselves thus purified,"
13844,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Removed, and to a distance that was fit:                           305"
13845,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,And so we all of us in some degree
13846,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Are led to knowledge, wheresoever led,"
13847,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"And howsoever; were it otherwise,"
13848,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,And we found evil fast as we find good
13849,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"In our first years, or think that it is found,                     310"
13850,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,How could the innocent heart bear up and live!
13851,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,But doubly fortunate my lot; not here
13852,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Alone, that something of a better life"
13853,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Perhaps was round me than it is the privilege
13854,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of most to move in, but that first I looked                        315"
13855,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,At Man through objects that were great or fair;
13856,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,First communed with him by their help. And thus
13857,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Was founded a sure safeguard and defence
13858,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Against the weight of meanness, selfish cares,"
13859,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Coarse manners, vulgar passions, that beat in                      320"
13860,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,On all sides from the ordinary world
13861,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,In which we traffic. Starting from this point
13862,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"I had my face turned toward the truth, began"
13863,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,With an advantage furnished by that kind
13864,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of prepossession, without which the soul                           325"
13865,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Receives no knowledge that can bring forth good,"
13866,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,No genuine insight ever comes to her.
13867,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,From the restraint of over-watchful eyes
13868,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Preserved, I moved about, year after year,"
13869,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Happy, [a] and now most thankful that my walk                      330"
13870,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Was guarded from too early intercourse
13871,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"With the deformities of crowded life,"
13872,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"And those ensuing laughters and contempts,"
13873,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Self-pleasing, which, if we would wish to think"
13874,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"With a due reverence on earth's rightful lord,                     335"
13875,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Here placed to be the inheritor of heaven,"
13876,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Will not permit us; but pursue the mind,"
13877,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"That to devotion willingly would rise,"
13878,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Into the temple and the temple's heart.
13879,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,
13880,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Yet deem not, Friend! that human kind with me                    340"
13881,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Thus early took a place pre-eminent;
13882,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Nature herself was, at this unripe time,"
13883,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,But secondary to my own pursuits
13884,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"And animal activities, and all"
13885,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Their trivial pleasures; [b] and when these had drooped            345
13886,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"And gradually expired, and Nature, prized"
13887,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"For her own sake, became my joy, even then--[b]"
13888,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"And upwards through late youth, until not less"
13889,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Than two-and-twenty summers had been told--[c]
13890,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Was Man in my affections and regards                               350
13891,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Subordinate to her, her visible forms"
13892,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"And viewless agencies: a passion, she,"
13893,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"A rapture often, and immediate love"
13894,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Ever at hand; he, only a delight"
13895,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Occasional, an accidental grace,                                   355"
13896,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,His hour being not yet come. Far less had then
13897,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"The inferior creatures, beast or bird, attuned"
13898,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,My spirit to that gentleness of love
13899,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"(Though they had long been carefully observed),"
13900,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Won from me those minute obeisances                                360
13901,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of tenderness, [d] which I may number now"
13902,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"With my first blessings. Nevertheless, on these"
13903,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"The light of beauty did not fall in vain,"
13904,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Or grandeur circumfuse them to no end.
13905,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,
13906,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,But when that first poetic faculty                               365
13907,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of plain Imagination and severe,"
13908,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"No longer a mute influence of the soul,"
13909,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Ventured, at some rash Muse's earnest call,"
13910,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,To try her strength among harmonious words; [e]
13911,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,And to book-notions and the rules of art                           370
13912,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Did knowingly conform itself; there came
13913,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Among the simple shapes of human life
13914,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,A wilfulness of fancy and conceit; [e]
13915,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,And Nature and her objects beautified
13916,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"These fictions, as in some sort, in their turn,                    375"
13917,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,They burnished her. From touch of this new power
13918,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Nothing was safe: the elder-tree that grew
13919,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Beside the well-known charnel-house had then
13920,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"A dismal look: the yew-tree had its ghost,"
13921,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,That took his station there for ornament:                          380
13922,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,The dignities of plain occurrence then
13923,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Were tasteless, and truth's golden mean, a point"
13924,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Where no sufficient pleasure could be found.
13925,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Then, if a widow, staggering with the blow"
13926,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of her distress, was known to have turned her steps                385"
13927,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"To the cold grave in which her husband slept,"
13928,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"One night, or haply more than one, through pain"
13929,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Or half-insensate impotence of mind,"
13930,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"The fact was caught at greedily, and there"
13931,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"She must be visitant the whole year through,                       390"
13932,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Wetting the turf with never-ending tears.
13933,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,
13934,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Through quaint obliquities I might pursue
13935,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"These cravings; when the fox-glove, one by one,"
13936,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Upwards through every stage of the tall stem,"
13937,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Had shed beside the public way its bells,                          395"
13938,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"And stood of all dismantled, save the last"
13939,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Left at the tapering ladder's top, that seemed"
13940,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,To bend as doth a slender blade of grass
13941,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Tipped with a rain-drop, Fancy loved to seat,"
13942,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Beneath the plant despoiled, but crested still                     400"
13943,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"With this last relic, soon itself to fall,"
13944,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Some vagrant mother, whose arch little ones,"
13945,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"All unconcerned by her dejected plight,"
13946,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Laughed as with rival eagerness their hands
13947,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Gathered the purple cups that round them lay,                      405"
13948,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Strewing the turf's green slope.
13949,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,A diamond light
13950,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"(Whene'er the summer sun, declining, smote"
13951,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,A smooth rock wet with constant springs) was seen
13952,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Sparkling from out a copse-clad bank that rose
13953,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Fronting our cottage. [f] Oft beside the hearth                    410
13954,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Seated, with open door, often and long"
13955,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Upon this restless lustre have I gazed,"
13956,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,That made my fancy restless as itself.
13957,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,'Twas now for me a burnished silver shield
13958,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Suspended over a knight's tomb, who lay                            415"
13959,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Inglorious, buried in the dusky wood:"
13960,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,An entrance now into some magic cave
13961,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Or palace built by fairies of the rock;
13962,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Nor could I have been bribed to disenchant
13963,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"The spectacle, by visiting the spot.                               420"
13964,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Thus wilful Fancy, in no hurtful mood,"
13965,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Engrafted far-fetched shapes on feelings bred
13966,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,By pure Imagination: busy Power [g]
13967,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"She was, and with her ready pupil turned"
13968,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Instinctively to human passions, then                              425"
13969,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Least understood. Yet, 'mid the fervent swarm"
13970,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of these vagaries, with an eye so rich"
13971,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,As mine was through the bounty of a grand
13972,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"And lovely region, [h] I had forms distinct"
13973,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,To steady me: each airy thought revolved                           430
13974,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Round a substantial centre, which at once"
13975,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Incited it to motion, and controlled."
13976,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"I did not pine like one in cities bred,"
13977,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"As was thy melancholy lot, dear Friend! [i]"
13978,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Great Spirit as thou art, in endless dreams                        435"
13979,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Of sickliness, disjoining, joining, things"
13980,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Without the light of knowledge. Where the harm,"
13981,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"If, when the woodman languished with disease"
13982,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Induced by sleeping nightly on the ground
13983,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Within his sod-built cabin, Indian-wise,                           440"
13984,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"I called the pangs of disappointed love,"
13985,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"And all the sad etcetera of the wrong,"
13986,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"To help him to his grave? Meanwhile the man,"
13987,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,If not already from the woods retired
13988,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"To die at home, was haply as I knew,                               445"
13989,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Withering by slow degrees, 'mid gentle airs,"
13990,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Birds, running streams, and hills so beautiful"
13991,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"On golden evenings, while the charcoal pile"
13992,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Breathed up its smoke, an image of his ghost"
13993,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Or spirit that full soon must take her flight.                     450
13994,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Nor shall we not be tending towards that point
13995,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Of sound humanity to which our Tale
13996,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Leads, though by sinuous ways, if here I shew"
13997,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"How Fancy, in a season when she wove"
13998,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Those slender cords, to guide the unconscious Boy                  455"
13999,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"For the Man's sake, could feed at Nature's call"
14000,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Some pensive musings which might well beseem
14001,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Maturer years.
14002,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,A grove there is whose boughs
14003,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Stretch from the western marge of Thurston-mere, [k]"
14004,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"With length of shade so thick, that whoso glides                   460"
14005,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Along the line of low-roofed water, moves"
14006,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"As in a cloister. Once--while, in that shade"
14007,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Loitering, I watched the golden beams of light"
14008,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Flung from the setting sun, as they reposed"
14009,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,In silent beauty on the naked ridge                                465
14010,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Of a high eastern hill--thus flowed my thoughts
14011,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,In a pure stream of words fresh from the heart:
14012,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Dear native Regions, [m] wheresoe'er shall close"
14013,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"My mortal course, there will I think on you;"
14014,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Dying, will cast on you a backward look;                           470"
14015,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Even as this setting sun (albeit the Vale
14016,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Is no where touched by one memorial gleam)
14017,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,Doth with the fond remains of his last power
14018,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Still linger, and a farewell lustre sheds"

14214,RETROSPECT--LOVE OF NATURE LEADING TO LOVE OF MAN,"Though fallen from bliss, when in the East he saw                  660"

14729,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And pocketed the relic, [G] in the guise                            70"
14730,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of an enthusiast; yet, in honest truth,"
14731,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"I looked for something that I could not find,"

14733,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"For 'tis most certain, that these various sights,"
14734,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"However potent their first shock, with me                           75"
14735,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Appeared to recompense the traveller's pains
14736,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Less than the painted Magdalene of Le Brun, [H]"
14737,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A beauty exquisitely wrought, with hair"
14738,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Dishevelled, gleaming eyes, and rueful cheek"

14741,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,But hence to my more permanent abode

14743,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Domestic manners, customs, gestures, looks,"
14744,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And all the attire of ordinary life,"
14745,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Attention was engrossed; and, thus amused,                          85"
14746,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"I stood, 'mid those concussions, unconcerned,"
14747,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Tranquil almost, and careless as a flower"
14748,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Glassed in a green-house, or a parlour shrub"
14749,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"That spreads its leaves in unmolested peace,"
14750,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"While every bush and tree, the country through,                     90"
14751,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Is shaking to the roots: indifference this
14752,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Which may seem strange: but I was unprepared
14753,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"With needful knowledge, had abruptly passed"
14754,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Into a theatre, whose stage was filled"
14755,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And busy with an action far advanced.                               95
14756,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Like others, I had skimmed, and sometimes read"
14757,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"With care, the master pamphlets of the day;"
14758,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Nor wanted such half-insight as grew wild
14759,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Upon that meagre soil, helped out by talk"
14760,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And public news; but having never seen                             100
14761,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,A chronicle that might suffice to show
14762,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Whence the main organs of the public power
14763,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Had sprung, their transmigrations, when and how"
14764,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Accomplished, giving thus unto events"
14765,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,A form and body; all things were to me                             105
14766,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Loose and disjointed, and the affections left"
14767,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Without a vital interest. At that time,"
14768,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Moreover, the first storm was overblown,"
14769,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And the strong hand of outward violence
14770,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Locked up in quiet. For myself, I fear                             110"
14771,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Now in connection with so great a theme
14772,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,To speak (as I must be compelled to do)
14773,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of one so unimportant; night by night
14774,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Did I frequent the formal haunts of men,"
14775,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Whom, in the city, privilege of birth                              115"
14776,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Sequestered from the rest, societies"
14777,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Polished in arts, and in punctilio versed;"
14778,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Whence, and from deeper causes, all discourse"
14779,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of good and evil of the time was shunned
14780,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,With scrupulous care; but these restrictions soon                  120
14781,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Proved tedious, and I gradually withdrew"
14782,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Into a noisier world, and thus ere long"
14783,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Became a patriot; and my heart was all
14784,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Given to the people, and my love was theirs."
14785,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,
14786,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A band of military Officers,                                       125"
14787,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Then stationed in the city, were the chief"
14788,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of my associates: some of these wore swords
14789,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"That had been seasoned in the wars, and all"
14790,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Were men well-born; the chivalry of France.
14791,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In age and temper differing, they had yet                          130"
14792,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,One spirit ruling in each heart; alike
14793,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"(Save only one, hereafter to be named) [I]"
14794,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Were bent upon undoing what was done:
14795,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,This was their rest and only hope; therewith
14796,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"No fear had they of bad becoming worse,                            135"
14797,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"For worst to them was come; nor would have stirred,"
14798,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Or deemed it worth a moment's thought to stir,"
14799,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In any thing, save only as the act"
14800,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Looked thitherward. One, reckoning by years,"
14801,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Was in the prime of manhood, and erewhile                          140"
14802,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,He had sate lord in many tender hearts;
14803,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Though heedless of such honours now, and changed:"
14804,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"His temper was quite mastered by the times,"
14805,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And they had blighted him, had eaten away"
14806,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"The beauty of his person, doing wrong                              145"
14807,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Alike to body and to mind: his port,"
14808,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Which once had been erect and open, now"
14809,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Was stooping and contracted, and a face,"
14810,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Endowed by Nature with her fairest gifts
14811,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of symmetry and light and bloom, expressed,                        150"
14812,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"As much as any that was ever seen,"
14813,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A ravage out of season, made by thoughts"
14814,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Unhealthy and vexatious. With the hour,"
14815,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,That from the press of Paris duly brought
14816,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Its freight of public news, the fever came,                        155"
14817,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A punctual visitant, to shake this man,"
14818,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Disarmed his voice and fanned his yellow cheek
14819,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Into a thousand colours; while he read,"
14820,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Or mused, his sword was haunted by his touch"
14821,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Continually, like an uneasy place                                  160"
14822,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,In his own body. 'Twas in truth an hour
14823,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of universal ferment; mildest men
14824,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Were agitated; and commotions, strife"
14825,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of passion and opinion, filled the walls"
14826,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of peaceful houses with unquiet sounds.                            165
14827,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"The soil of common life, was, at that time,"
14828,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Too hot to tread upon. Oft said I then,"
14829,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And not then only, ""What a mockery this"
14830,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of history, the past and that to come!"
14831,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Now do I feel how all men are deceived,                            170"
14832,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Reading of nations and their works, in faith,"
14833,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Faith given to vanity and emptiness;
14834,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Oh! laughter for the page that would reflect
14835,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"To future times the face of what now is!"""
14836,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"The land all swarmed with passion, like a plain                    175"
14837,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Devoured by locusts,--Carra, Gorsas,--add"
14838,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A hundred other names, forgotten now, [K]"
14839,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Nor to be heard of more; yet, they were powers,"
14840,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Like earthquakes, shocks repeated day by day,"
14841,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And felt through every nook of town and field.                     180
14842,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,
14843,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Such was the state of things. Meanwhile the chief
14844,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of my associates stood prepared for flight
14845,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,To augment the band of emigrants in arms [L]
14846,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Upon the borders of the Rhine, and leagued"
14847,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,With foreign foes mustered for instant war.                        185
14848,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"This was their undisguised intent, and they"
14849,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Were waiting with the whole of their desires
14850,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,The moment to depart.
14851,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"An Englishman,"
14852,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Born in a land whose very name appeared
14853,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,To license some unruliness of mind;                                190
14854,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A stranger, with youth's further privilege,"
14855,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And the indulgence that a half-learnt speech
14856,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Wins from the courteous; I, who had been else"
14857,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Shunned and not tolerated, freely lived"
14858,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"With these defenders of the Crown, and talked,                     195"
14859,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And heard their notions; nor did they disdain
14860,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,The wish to bring me over to their cause.
14861,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,
14862,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,But though untaught by thinking or by books
14863,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"To reason well of polity or law,"
14864,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And nice distinctions, then on every tongue,                       200"
14865,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of natural rights and civil; and to acts
14866,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of nations and their passing interests,"
14867,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,(If with unworldly ends and aims compared)
14868,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Almost indifferent, even the historian's tale"
14869,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Prizing but little otherwise than I prized                         205
14870,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Tales of the poets, as it made the heart"
14871,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Beat high, and filled the fancy with fair forms,"
14872,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Old heroes and their sufferings and their deeds;
14873,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Yet in the regal sceptre, and the pomp"
14874,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of orders and degrees, I nothing found                             210"
14875,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Then, or had ever, even in crudest youth,"
14876,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"That dazzled me, but rather what I mourned"

14884,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Through the whole tenor of my school-day time,"
14885,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"The face of one, who, whether boy or man,                          220"
14886,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Was vested with attention or respect
14887,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Through claims of wealth or blood; nor was it least
14888,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of many benefits, in later years"
14889,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Derived from academic institutes
14890,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And rules, that they held something up to view                     225"
14891,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of a Republic, where all stood thus far"
14892,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Upon equal ground; that we were brothers all
14893,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In honour, as in one community,"
14894,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Scholars and gentlemen; where, furthermore,"
14895,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Distinction open lay to all that came,                             230"
14896,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And wealth and titles were in less esteem
14897,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Than talents, worth, and prosperous industry."
14898,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Add unto this, subservience from the first"
14899,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,To presences of God's mysterious power
14900,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Made manifest in Nature's sovereignty,                             235"
14901,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And fellowship with venerable books,"
14902,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"To sanction the proud workings of the soul,"
14903,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And mountain liberty. It could not be
14904,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,But that one tutored thus should look with awe
14905,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Upon the faculties of man, receive                                 240"
14906,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Gladly the highest promises, and hail,"
14907,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"As best, the government of equal rights"
14908,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And individual worth. And hence, O Friend!"
14909,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,If at the first great outbreak I rejoiced
14910,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Less than might well befit my youth, the cause                     245"
14911,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In part lay here, that unto me the events"
14912,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Seemed nothing out of nature's certain course,"
14913,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,A gift that was come rather late than soon.
14914,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"No wonder, then, if advocates like these,"
14915,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Inflamed by passion, blind with prejudice,                         250"
14916,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And stung with injury, at this riper day,"
14917,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Were impotent to make my hopes put on
14918,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"The shape of theirs, my understanding bend"
14919,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In honour to their honour: zeal, which yet"
14920,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Had slumbered, now in opposition burst                             255"
14921,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Forth like a Polar summer: every word
14922,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"They uttered was a dart, by counter-winds"
14923,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Blown back upon themselves; their reason seemed
14924,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Confusion-stricken by a higher power
14925,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Than human understanding, their discourse                          260"
14926,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Maimed, spiritless; and, in their weakness strong,"
14927,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,I triumphed.
14928,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,
14929,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Meantime, day by day, the roads"
14930,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Were crowded with the bravest youth of France, [M]"
14931,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And all the promptest of her spirits, linked"
14932,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In gallant soldiership, and posting on                             265"
14933,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,To meet the war upon her frontier bounds.
14934,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Yet at this very moment do tears start
14935,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Into mine eyes: I do not say I weep--
14936,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"I wept not then,--but tears have dimmed my sight,"
14937,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In memory of the farewells of that time,                           270"
14938,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Domestic severings, female fortitude"
14939,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"At dearest separation, patriot love"
14940,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And self-devotion, and terrestrial hope,"
14941,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Encouraged with a martyr's confidence;
14942,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Even files of strangers merely seen but once,                      275"
14943,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And for a moment, men from far with sound"
14944,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of music, martial tunes, and banners spread,"
14945,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Entering the city, here and there a face,"
14946,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Or person singled out among the rest,"
14947,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Yet still a stranger and beloved as such;                          280
14948,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Even by these passing spectacles my heart
14949,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Was oftentimes uplifted, and they seemed"
14950,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Arguments sent from Heaven to prove the cause
14951,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Good, pure, which no one could stand up against,"
14952,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Who was not lost, abandoned, selfish, proud,                       285"
14953,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Mean, miserable, wilfully depraved,"
14954,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Hater perverse of equity and truth.
14955,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,
14956,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Among that band of Officers was one,"
14957,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Already hinted at, [N] of other mould--"
14958,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A patriot, thence rejected by the rest,                            290"
14959,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And with an oriental loathing spurned,"
14960,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,As of a different caste. A meeker man
14961,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Than this lived never, nor a more benign,"
14962,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Meek though enthusiastic. Injuries
14963,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Made _him_ more gracious, and his nature then                      295"
14964,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Did breathe its sweetness out most sensibly,"
14965,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"As aromatic flowers on Alpine turf,"
14966,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,When foot hath crushed them. He through the events
14967,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of that great change wandered in perfect faith,"
14968,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"As through a book, an old romance, or tale                         300"
14969,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of Fairy, or some dream of actions wrought"
14970,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Behind the summer clouds. By birth he ranked
14971,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"With the most noble, but unto the poor"
14972,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Among mankind he was in service bound,"
14973,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"As by some tie invisible, oaths professed                          305"
14974,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,To a religious order. Man he loved
14975,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"As man; and, to the mean and the obscure,"
14976,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And all the homely in their homely works,"
14977,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Transferred a courtesy which had no air
14978,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of condescension; but did rather seem                              310
14979,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A passion and a gallantry, like that"
14980,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Which he, a soldier, in his idler day"
14981,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Had paid to woman: somewhat vain he was,"
14982,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Or seemed so, yet it was not vanity,"
14983,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"But fondness, and a kind of radiant joy                            315"
14984,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Diffused around him, while he was intent"
14985,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"On works of love or freedom, or revolved"
14986,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Complacently the progress of a cause,"
14987,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Whereof he was a part: yet this was meek
14988,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And placid, and took nothing from the man                          320"
14989,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,That was delightful. Oft in solitude
14990,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,With him did I discourse about the end
14991,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of civil government, and its wisest forms;"
14992,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of ancient loyalty, and chartered rights,"
14993,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Custom and habit, novelty and change;                              325"
14994,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of self-respect, and virtue in the few"
14995,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"For patrimonial honour set apart,"
14996,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And ignorance in the labouring multitude.
14997,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"For he, to all intolerance indisposed,"
14998,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Balanced these contemplations in his mind;                         330
14999,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And I, who at that time was scarcely dipped"
15000,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Into the turmoil, bore a sounder judgment"
15001,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Than later days allowed; carried about me,"
15002,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"With less alloy to its integrity,"
15003,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"The experience of past ages, as, through help                      335"
15004,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of books and common life, it makes sure way"
15005,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"To youthful minds, by objects over near"
15006,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Not pressed upon, nor dazzled or misled"
15007,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,By struggling with the crowd for present ends.
15008,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,
15009,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"But though not deaf, nor obstinate to find                       340"
15010,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Error without excuse upon the side
15011,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of them who strove against us, more delight"
15012,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"We took, and let this freely be confessed,"
15013,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,In painting to ourselves the miseries
15014,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of royal courts, and that voluptuous life                          345"
15015,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Unfeeling, where the man who is of soul"
15016,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"The meanest thrives the most; where dignity,"
15017,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"True personal dignity, abideth not;"
15018,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A light, a cruel, and vain world cut off"
15019,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"From the natural inlets of just sentiment,                         350"
15020,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,From lowly sympathy and chastening truth;
15021,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Where good and evil interchange their names,"
15022,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And thirst for bloody spoils abroad is paired
15023,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,With vice at home. We added dearest themes--
15024,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Man and his noble nature, as it is                                 355"
15025,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"The gift which God has placed within his power,"
15026,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,His blind desires and steady faculties
15027,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Capable of clear truth, the one to break"
15028,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Bondage, the other to build liberty"
15029,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"On firm foundations, making social life,                           360"
15030,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Through knowledge spreading and imperishable,"
15031,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"As just in regulation, and as pure"
15032,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,As individual in the wise and good.
15033,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,
15034,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,We summoned up the honourable deeds
15035,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of ancient Story, thought of each bright spot,                     365"
15036,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"That would be found in all recorded time,"
15037,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of truth preserved and error passed away;
15038,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of single spirits that catch the flame from Heaven,"
15039,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And how the multitudes of men will feed
15040,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And fan each other; thought of sects, how keen                     370"
15041,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"They are to put the appropriate nature on,"
15042,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Triumphant over every obstacle
15043,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of custom, language, country, love, or hate,"
15044,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And what they do and suffer for their creed;
15045,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"How far they travel, and how long endure;                          375"
15046,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"How quickly mighty Nations have been formed,"
15047,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"From least beginnings; how, together locked"
15048,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"By new opinions, scattered tribes have made"
15049,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"One body, spreading wide as clouds in heaven."
15050,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,To aspirations then of our own minds                               380
15051,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Did we appeal; and, finally, beheld"
15052,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,A living confirmation of the whole
15053,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Before us, in a people from the depth"
15054,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of shameful imbecility uprisen,"
15055,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Fresh as the morning star. Elate we looked                         385
15056,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Upon their virtues; saw, in rudest men,"
15057,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Self-sacrifice the firmest; generous love,"
15058,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And continence of mind, and sense of right,"
15059,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Uppermost in the midst of fiercest strife.
15060,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,
15061,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Oh, sweet it is, in academic groves,                             390"
15062,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Or such retirement, Friend! as we have known"
15063,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In the green dales beside our Rotha's stream,"
15064,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Greta, or Derwent, or some nameless rill,"
15065,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"To ruminate, with interchange of talk,"
15066,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"On rational liberty, and hope in man,                              395"
15067,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Justice and peace. But far more sweet such toil--
15068,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Toil, say I, for it leads to thoughts abstruse--"
15069,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,If nature then be standing on the brink
15070,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of some great trial, and we hear the voice"
15071,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of one devoted, one whom circumstance                              400"
15072,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Hath called upon to embody his deep sense
15073,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In action, give it outwardly a shape,"
15074,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And that of benediction, to the world."
15075,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Then doubt is not, and truth is more than truth,--"
15076,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A hope it is, and a desire; a creed                                405"
15077,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of zeal, by an authority Divine"
15078,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Sanctioned, of danger, difficulty, or death."
15079,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Such conversation, under Attic shades,"
15080,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Did Dion hold with Plato; [O] ripened thus
15081,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"For a Deliverer's glorious task,--and such                         410"
15082,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"He, on that ministry already bound,"
15083,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Held with Eudemus and Timonides, [P]"
15084,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Surrounded by adventurers in arms,"
15085,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"When those two vessels with their daring freight,"
15086,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"For the Sicilian Tyrant's overthrow,                               415"
15087,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Sailed from Zacynthus,--philosophic war,"
15088,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Led by Philosophers. [Q] With harder fate,"
15089,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Though like ambition, such was he, O Friend!"
15090,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of whom I speak. So Beaupuis (let the name
15091,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Stand near the worthiest of Antiquity)                             420
15092,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Fashioned his life; and many a long discourse,"
15093,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"With like persuasion honoured, we maintained:"
15094,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"He, on his part, accoutred for the worst."
15095,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"He perished fighting, in supreme command,"
15096,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,                             425"
15097,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"For liberty, against deluded men,"
15098,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,His fellow country-men; and yet most blessed
15099,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In this, that he the fate of later times"
15100,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Lived not to see, nor what we now behold,"
15101,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Who have as ardent hearts as he had then.                          430
15102,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,
15103,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Along that very Loire, with festal mirth"
15104,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Resounding at all hours, and innocent yet"
15105,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of civil slaughter, was our frequent walk;"
15106,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Or in wide forests of continuous shade,"
15107,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Lofty and over-arched, with open space                             435"
15108,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Beneath the trees, clear footing many a mile--"
15109,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A solemn region. Oft amid those haunts,"
15110,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"From earnest dialogues I slipped in thought,"
15111,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And let remembrance steal to other times,"
15112,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"When, o'er those interwoven roots, moss-clad,                      440"
15113,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"And smooth as marble or a waveless sea,"
15114,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Some Hermit, from his cell forth-strayed, might pace"
15115,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,In sylvan meditation undisturbed;
15116,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,As on the pavement of a Gothic church
15117,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Walks a lone Monk, when service hath expired,                      445"
15118,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In peace and silence. But if e'er was heard,--"
15119,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Heard, though unseen,--a devious traveller,"
15120,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Retiring or approaching from afar
15121,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,With speed and echoes loud of trampling hoofs
15122,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"From the hard floor reverberated, then                             450"
15123,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,It was Angelica [R] thundering through the woods
15124,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Upon her palfrey, or that gentle maid"
15125,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Erminia, [S] fugitive as fair as she."
15126,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Sometimes methought I saw a pair of knights
15127,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Joust underneath the trees, that as in storm                       455"
15128,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Rocked high above their heads; anon, the din"
15129,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of boisterous merriment, and music's roar,"
15130,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In sudden proclamation, burst from haunt"
15131,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of Satyrs in some viewless glade, with dance"
15132,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Rejoicing o'er a female in the midst,                              460"
15133,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A mortal beauty, their unhappy thrall."
15134,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"The width of those huge forests, unto me"
15135,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"A novel scene, did often in this way"
15136,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Master my fancy while I wandered on
15137,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,With that revered companion. And sometimes--465
15138,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"When to a convent in a meadow green,"
15139,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"By a brook-side, we came, a roofless pile,"
15140,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And not by reverential touch of Time
15141,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Dismantled, but by violence abrupt--"
15142,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In spite of those heart-bracing colloquies,                        470"
15143,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In spite of real fervour, and of that"
15144,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Less genuine and wrought up within myself--
15145,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"I could not but bewail a wrong so harsh,"
15146,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And for the Matin-bell to sound no more
15147,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Grieved, and the twilight taper, and the cross                     475"
15148,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"High on the topmost pinnacle, a sign"
15149,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,(How welcome to the weary traveller's eyes!)
15150,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Of hospitality and peaceful rest.
15151,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,And when the partner of those varied walks
15152,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Pointed upon occasion to the site                                  480
15153,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Of Romorentin, home of ancient kings, [T]"
15154,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"To the imperial edifice of Blois, [U]"
15155,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"Or to that rural castle, name now slipped"
15156,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"From my remembrance, where a lady lodged, [V]"
15157,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"By the first Francis wooed, and bound to him                       485"
15158,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"In chains of mutual passion, from the tower,"
15159,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,"As a tradition of the country tells,"
15160,RESIDENCE IN FRANCE,Practised to commune with her royal knight

15482,BOOK TENTH,"Upon his rich domains, vineyard and tilth,"
15483,BOOK TENTH,"Green meadow-ground, and many-coloured woods,"
15484,BOOK TENTH,"Again, and yet again, a farewell look;"
15485,BOOK TENTH,"Then from the quiet of that scene passed on,                        10"
15486,BOOK TENTH,Bound to the fierce Metropolis. [A] From his throne
15487,BOOK TENTH,"The King had fallen, [B] and that invading host--"
15488,BOOK TENTH,"Presumptuous cloud, on whose black front was written"
15489,BOOK TENTH,The tender mercies of the dismal wind
15490,BOOK TENTH,That bore it--on the plains of Liberty                              15
15491,BOOK TENTH,"Had burst innocuous. Say in bolder words,"
15492,BOOK TENTH,They--who had come elate as eastern hunters
15493,BOOK TENTH,"Banded beneath the Great Mogul, when he"
15494,BOOK TENTH,"Erewhile went forth from Agra or Lahore,"
15495,BOOK TENTH,"Rajahs and Omrahs [C] in his train, intent                          20"
15496,BOOK TENTH,To drive their prey enclosed within a ring
15497,BOOK TENTH,"Wide as a province, but, the signal given,"
15498,BOOK TENTH,Before the point of the life-threatening spear
15499,BOOK TENTH,"Narrowing itself by moments--they, rash men,"
15500,BOOK TENTH,Had seen the anticipated quarry turned                              25
15501,BOOK TENTH,"Into avengers, from whose wrath they fled"
15502,BOOK TENTH,In terror. Disappointment and dismay
15503,BOOK TENTH,Remained for all whose fancies had run wild
15504,BOOK TENTH,With evil expectations; confidence
15505,BOOK TENTH,And perfect triumph for the better cause.                           30
15506,BOOK TENTH,
15507,BOOK TENTH,"The State, as if to stamp the final seal"
15508,BOOK TENTH,"On her security, and to the world"
15509,BOOK TENTH,"Show what she was, a high and fearless soul,"
15510,BOOK TENTH,"Exulting in defiance, or heart-stung"
15511,BOOK TENTH,"By sharp resentment, or belike to taunt                             35"
15512,BOOK TENTH,"With spiteful gratitude the baffled League,"
15513,BOOK TENTH,That had stirred up her slackening faculties
15514,BOOK TENTH,"To a new transition, when the King was crushed,"
15515,BOOK TENTH,"Spared not the empty throne, and in proud haste"
15516,BOOK TENTH,Assumed the body and venerable name                                 40
15517,BOOK TENTH,"Of a Republic. [D] Lamentable crimes,"
15518,BOOK TENTH,"'Tis true, had gone before this hour, dire work"
15519,BOOK TENTH,"Of massacre, [E] in which the senseless sword"
15520,BOOK TENTH,"Was prayed to as a judge; but these were past,"
15521,BOOK TENTH,"Earth free from them for ever, as was thought,--45"
15522,BOOK TENTH,"Ephemeral monsters, to be seen but once!"
15523,BOOK TENTH,Things that could only show themselves and die.
15524,BOOK TENTH,
15525,BOOK TENTH,"Cheered with this hope, to Paris I returned, [F]"
15526,BOOK TENTH,"And ranged, with ardour heretofore unfelt,"
15527,BOOK TENTH,"The spacious city, and in progress passed                           50"
15528,BOOK TENTH,"The prison where the unhappy Monarch lay,"
15529,BOOK TENTH,Associate with his children and his wife
15530,BOOK TENTH,"In bondage; and the palace, lately stormed"
15531,BOOK TENTH,With roar of cannon by a furious host.
15532,BOOK TENTH,I crossed the square (an empty area then!) [G]                      55
15533,BOOK TENTH,"Of the Carrousel, where so late had lain"
15534,BOOK TENTH,"The dead, upon the dying heaped, and gazed"
15535,BOOK TENTH,"On this and other spots, as doth a man"
15536,BOOK TENTH,Upon a volume whose contents he knows
15537,BOOK TENTH,"Are memorable, but from him locked up,                              60"
15538,BOOK TENTH,"Being written in a tongue he cannot read,"
15539,BOOK TENTH,"So that he questions the mute leaves with pain,"
15540,BOOK TENTH,And half upbraids their silence. But that night
15541,BOOK TENTH,"I felt most deeply in what world I was,"
15542,BOOK TENTH,"What ground I trod on, and what air I breathed.                     65"
15543,BOOK TENTH,"High was my room and lonely, near the roof"
15544,BOOK TENTH,"Of a large mansion or hotel, a lodge"
15545,BOOK TENTH,That would have pleased me in more quiet times;
15546,BOOK TENTH,Nor was it wholly without pleasure then.
15547,BOOK TENTH,"With unextinguished taper I kept watch,                             70"
15548,BOOK TENTH,Reading at intervals; the fear gone by
15549,BOOK TENTH,Pressed on me almost like a fear to come.
15550,BOOK TENTH,"I thought of those September massacres,"
15551,BOOK TENTH,"Divided from me by one little month,  [H]"
15552,BOOK TENTH,Saw them and touched: the rest was conjured up                      75
15553,BOOK TENTH,"From tragic fictions or true history,"
15554,BOOK TENTH,Remembrances and dim admonishments.
15555,BOOK TENTH,"The horse is taught his manage, and no star"
15556,BOOK TENTH,Of wildest course but treads back his own steps;
15557,BOOK TENTH,For the spent hurricane the air provides                            80
15558,BOOK TENTH,As fierce a successor; the tide retreats
15559,BOOK TENTH,But to return out of its hiding-place
15560,BOOK TENTH,In the great deep; all things have second-birth;
15561,BOOK TENTH,The earthquake is not satisfied at once;
15562,BOOK TENTH,"And in this way I wrought upon myself,                              85"
15563,BOOK TENTH,"Until I seemed to hear a voice that cried,"
15564,BOOK TENTH,"To the whole city, ""Sleep no more."" The trance"
15565,BOOK TENTH,Fled with the voice to which it had given birth;
15566,BOOK TENTH,But vainly comments of a calmer mind
15567,BOOK TENTH,Promised soft peace and sweet forgetfulness.                        90
15568,BOOK TENTH,"The place, all hushed and silent as it was,"
15569,BOOK TENTH,"Appeared unfit for the repose of night,"
15570,BOOK TENTH,Defenceless as a wood where tigers roam.
15571,BOOK TENTH,
15572,BOOK TENTH,With early morning towards the Palace-walk
15573,BOOK TENTH,Of Orléans eagerly I turned; as yet                                 95
15574,BOOK TENTH,The streets were still; not so those long Arcades;
15575,BOOK TENTH,"There, 'mid a peal of ill-matched sounds and cries,"
15576,BOOK TENTH,"That greeted me on entering, I could hear"
15577,BOOK TENTH,"Shrill voices from the hawkers in the throng,"
15578,BOOK TENTH,"Bawling, ""Denunciation of the Crimes                               100"
15579,BOOK TENTH,"Of Maximilian Robespierre;"" the hand,"
15580,BOOK TENTH,"Prompt as the voice, held forth a printed speech,"
15581,BOOK TENTH,"The same that had been recently pronounced,"
15582,BOOK TENTH,"When Robespierre, not ignorant for what mark"
15583,BOOK TENTH,Some words of indirect reproof had been                            105
15584,BOOK TENTH,"Intended, rose in hardihood, and dared"
15585,BOOK TENTH,The man who had an ill surmise of him
15586,BOOK TENTH,"To bring his charge in openness; whereat,"
15587,BOOK TENTH,"When a dead pause ensued, and no one stirred,"
15588,BOOK TENTH,"In silence of all present, from his seat                           110"
15589,BOOK TENTH,"Louvet walked single through the avenue,"
15590,BOOK TENTH,"And took his station in the Tribune, saying,"
15591,BOOK TENTH,"""I, Robespierre, accuse thee!"" [I] Well is known"
15592,BOOK TENTH,"The inglorious issue of that charge, and how"
15593,BOOK TENTH,"He, who had launched the startling thunderbolt,                    115"
15594,BOOK TENTH,"The one bold man, whose voice the attack had sounded,"
15595,BOOK TENTH,Was left without a follower to discharge
15596,BOOK TENTH,"His perilous duty, and retire lamenting"
15597,BOOK TENTH,That Heaven's best aid is wasted upon men
15598,BOOK TENTH,Who to themselves are false. [K]
15599,BOOK TENTH,But these are things                               120
15600,BOOK TENTH,"Of which I speak, only as they were storm"
15601,BOOK TENTH,"Or sunshine to my individual mind,"
15602,BOOK TENTH,No further. Let me then relate that now--
15603,BOOK TENTH,In some sort seeing with my proper eyes
15604,BOOK TENTH,"That Liberty, and Life, and Death would soon                       125"
15605,BOOK TENTH,To the remotest corners of the land
15606,BOOK TENTH,Lie in the arbitrement of those who ruled
15607,BOOK TENTH,"The capital City; what was struggled for,"
15608,BOOK TENTH,And by what combatants victory must be won;
15609,BOOK TENTH,The indecision on their part whose aim                             130
15610,BOOK TENTH,"Seemed best, and the straightforward path of those"
15611,BOOK TENTH,Who in attack or in defence were strong
15612,BOOK TENTH,Through their impiety--my inmost soul
15613,BOOK TENTH,"Was agitated; yea, I could almost"
15614,BOOK TENTH,"Have prayed that throughout earth upon all men,                    135"
15615,BOOK TENTH,By patient exercise of reason made
15616,BOOK TENTH,"Worthy of liberty, all spirits filled"
15617,BOOK TENTH,"With zeal expanding in Truth's holy light,"
15618,BOOK TENTH,"The gift of tongues might fall, and power arrive"
15619,BOOK TENTH,From the four quarters of the winds to do                          140
15620,BOOK TENTH,"For France, what without help she could not do,"
15621,BOOK TENTH,A work of honour; think not that to this
15622,BOOK TENTH,"I added, work of safety: from all doubt"
15623,BOOK TENTH,Or trepidation for the end of things
15624,BOOK TENTH,"Far was I, far as angels are from guilt.                           145"
15625,BOOK TENTH,
15626,BOOK TENTH,"Yet did I grieve, nor only grieved, but thought"
15627,BOOK TENTH,Of opposition and of remedies:
15628,BOOK TENTH,"An insignificant stranger and obscure,"
15629,BOOK TENTH,"And one, moreover, little graced with power"
15630,BOOK TENTH,"Of eloquence even in my native speech,                             150"
15631,BOOK TENTH,"And all unfit for tumult or intrigue,"
15632,BOOK TENTH,Yet would I at this time with willing heart
15633,BOOK TENTH,Have undertaken for a cause so great
15634,BOOK TENTH,"Service however dangerous. I revolved,"
15635,BOOK TENTH,How much the destiny of Man had still                              155
15636,BOOK TENTH,"Hung upon single persons; that there was,"
15637,BOOK TENTH,"Transcendent to all local patrimony,"
15638,BOOK TENTH,"One nature, as there is one sun in heaven;"
15639,BOOK TENTH,"That objects, even as they are great, thereby"
15640,BOOK TENTH,Do come within the reach of humblest eyes;                         160
15641,BOOK TENTH,That Man is only weak through his mistrust
15642,BOOK TENTH,And want of hope where evidence divine
15643,BOOK TENTH,Proclaims to him that hope should be most sure;
15644,BOOK TENTH,Nor did the inexperience of my youth
15645,BOOK TENTH,"Preclude conviction, that a spirit strong,                         165"
15646,BOOK TENTH,"In hope, and trained to noble aspirations,"
15647,BOOK TENTH,"A spirit thoroughly faithful to itself,"
15648,BOOK TENTH,Is for Society's unreasoning herd
15649,BOOK TENTH,"A domineering instinct, serves at once"
15650,BOOK TENTH,"For way and guide, a fluent receptacle                             170"
15651,BOOK TENTH,That gathers up each petty straggling rill
15652,BOOK TENTH,"And vein of water, glad to be rolled on"
15653,BOOK TENTH,"In safe obedience; that a mind, whose rest"
15654,BOOK TENTH,"Is where it ought to be, in self-restraint,"
15655,BOOK TENTH,"In circumspection and simplicity,                                  175"
15656,BOOK TENTH,Falls rarely in entire discomfiture
15657,BOOK TENTH,"Below its aim, or meets with, from without,"
15658,BOOK TENTH,A treachery that foils it or defeats;
15659,BOOK TENTH,"And, lastly, if the means on human will,"
15660,BOOK TENTH,"Frail human will, dependent should betray                          180"
15661,BOOK TENTH,"Him who too boldly trusted them, I felt"
15662,BOOK TENTH,That 'mid the loud distractions of the world
15663,BOOK TENTH,"A sovereign voice subsists within the soul,"
15664,BOOK TENTH,"Arbiter undisturbed of right and wrong,"
15665,BOOK TENTH,"Of life and death, in majesty severe                               185"
15666,BOOK TENTH,"Enjoining, as may best promote the aims"
15667,BOOK TENTH,"Of truth and justice, either sacrifice,"
15668,BOOK TENTH,From whatsoever region of our cares
15669,BOOK TENTH,"Or our infirm affections Nature pleads,"
15670,BOOK TENTH,"Earnest and blind, against the stern decree.                       190"
15671,BOOK TENTH,
15672,BOOK TENTH,"On the other side, I called to mind those truths"
15673,BOOK TENTH,That are the common-places of the schools--
15674,BOOK TENTH,"(A theme for boys, too hackneyed for their sires,)"
15675,BOOK TENTH,"Yet, with a revelation's liveliness,"
15676,BOOK TENTH,In all their comprehensive bearings known                          195
15677,BOOK TENTH,"And visible to philosophers of old,"
15678,BOOK TENTH,"Men who, to business of the world untrained,"
15679,BOOK TENTH,Lived in the shade; and to Harmodius known
15680,BOOK TENTH,"And his compeer Aristogiton, [L] known"
15681,BOOK TENTH,"To Brutus--that tyrannic power is weak,                            200"
15682,BOOK TENTH,"Hath neither gratitude, nor faith, nor love,"
15683,BOOK TENTH,Nor the support of good or evil men
15684,BOOK TENTH,To trust in; that the godhead which is ours
15685,BOOK TENTH,Can never utterly be charmed or stilled;
15686,BOOK TENTH,That nothing hath a natural right to last                          205
15687,BOOK TENTH,But equity and reason; that all else
15688,BOOK TENTH,"Meets foes irreconcilable, and at best"
15689,BOOK TENTH,Lives only by variety of disease.
15690,BOOK TENTH,
15691,BOOK TENTH,"Well might my wishes be intense, my thoughts"
15692,BOOK TENTH,"Strong and perturbed, not doubting at that time                    210"
15693,BOOK TENTH,But that the virtue of one paramount mind
15694,BOOK TENTH,Would have abashed those impious crests--have quelled
15695,BOOK TENTH,"Outrage and bloody power, and, in despite"
15696,BOOK TENTH,Of what the People long had been and were
15697,BOOK TENTH,"Through ignorance and false teaching, sadder proof                 215"
15698,BOOK TENTH,"Of immaturity, and in the teeth"
15699,BOOK TENTH,Of desperate opposition from without--
15700,BOOK TENTH,"Have cleared a passage for just government,"
15701,BOOK TENTH,"And left a solid birthright to the State,"
15702,BOOK TENTH,"Redeemed, according to example given                               220"
15703,BOOK TENTH,By ancient lawgivers.
15704,BOOK TENTH,"In this frame of mind,"
15705,BOOK TENTH,"Dragged by a chain of harsh necessity,"
15706,BOOK TENTH,"So seemed it,--now I thankfully acknowledge,"
15707,BOOK TENTH,"Forced by the gracious providence of Heaven,--"
15708,BOOK TENTH,"To England I returned, [M] else (though assured                    225"
15709,BOOK TENTH,"That I both was and must be of small weight,"
15710,BOOK TENTH,No better than a landsman on the deck
15711,BOOK TENTH,Of a ship struggling with a hideous storm)
15712,BOOK TENTH,"Doubtless, I should have then made common cause"
15713,BOOK TENTH,"With some who perished; haply perished too, [N]                    230"
15714,BOOK TENTH,"A poor mistaken and bewildered offering,--"
15715,BOOK TENTH,"Should to the breast of Nature have gone back,"
15716,BOOK TENTH,"With all my resolutions, all my hopes,"
15717,BOOK TENTH,"A Poet only to myself, to men"
15718,BOOK TENTH,"Useless, and even, beloved Friend! a soul                          235"
15719,BOOK TENTH,To thee unknown!
15720,BOOK TENTH,
15721,BOOK TENTH,Twice had the trees let fall
15722,BOOK TENTH,"Their leaves, as often Winter had put on"
15723,BOOK TENTH,"His hoary crown, since I had seen the surge"
15724,BOOK TENTH,"Beat against Albion's shore, [O] since ear of mine"
15725,BOOK TENTH,Had caught the accents of my native speech                         240
15726,BOOK TENTH,Upon our native country's sacred ground.
15727,BOOK TENTH,"A patriot of the world, how could I glide"
15728,BOOK TENTH,"Into communion with her sylvan shades,"
15729,BOOK TENTH,Erewhile my tuneful haunt? It pleased me more
15730,BOOK TENTH,"To abide in the great City, [P] where I found                      245"
15731,BOOK TENTH,The general air still busy with the stir
15732,BOOK TENTH,Of that first memorable onset made
15733,BOOK TENTH,By a strong levy of humanity
15734,BOOK TENTH,Upon the traffickers in Negro blood; [Q]
15735,BOOK TENTH,"Effort which, though defeated, had recalled                        250"
15736,BOOK TENTH,"To notice old forgotten principles,"
15737,BOOK TENTH,And through the nation spread a novel heat
15738,BOOK TENTH,"Of virtuous feeling. For myself, I own"
15739,BOOK TENTH,That this particular strife had wanted power
15740,BOOK TENTH,To rivet my affections; nor did now                                255
15741,BOOK TENTH,Its unsuccessful issue much excite
15742,BOOK TENTH,My sorrow; for I brought with me the faith
15743,BOOK TENTH,"That, if France prospered, good men would not long"
15744,BOOK TENTH,"Pay fruitless worship to humanity,"
15745,BOOK TENTH,"And this most rotten branch of human shame,                        260"
15746,BOOK TENTH,"Object, so seemed it, of superfluous pains,"
15747,BOOK TENTH,Would fall together with its parent tree.
15748,BOOK TENTH,"What, then, were my emotions, when in arms"
15749,BOOK TENTH,"Britain put forth her free-born strength in league,"
15750,BOOK TENTH,"Oh, pity and shame! with those confederate Powers!                 265"
15751,BOOK TENTH,"Not in my single self alone I found,"
15752,BOOK TENTH,"But in the minds of all ingenuous youth,"
15753,BOOK TENTH,Change and subversion from that hour. No shock
15754,BOOK TENTH,Given to my moral nature had I known
15755,BOOK TENTH,Down to that very moment; neither lapse                            270
15756,BOOK TENTH,Nor turn of sentiment that might be named
15757,BOOK TENTH,"A revolution, save at this one time;"
15758,BOOK TENTH,All else was progress on the self-same path
15759,BOOK TENTH,"On which, with a diversity of pace,"
15760,BOOK TENTH,I had been travelling: this a stride at once                       275
15761,BOOK TENTH,Into another region. As a light
15762,BOOK TENTH,"And pliant harebell, swinging in the breeze"
15763,BOOK TENTH,On some grey rock--its birth-place--so had I
15764,BOOK TENTH,"Wantoned, fast rooted on the ancient tower"
15765,BOOK TENTH,"Of my beloved country, wishing not                                 280"
15766,BOOK TENTH,A happier fortune than to wither there:
15767,BOOK TENTH,Now was I from that pleasant station torn
15768,BOOK TENTH,"And tossed about in whirlwind. I rejoiced,"
15769,BOOK TENTH,"Yea, afterwards--truth most painful to record!--"
15770,BOOK TENTH,"Exulted, in the triumph of my soul,                                285"
15771,BOOK TENTH,"When Englishmen by thousands were o'erthrown,"
15772,BOOK TENTH,"Left without glory on the field, or driven,"
15773,BOOK TENTH,"Brave hearts! to shameful flight. It was a grief,--"
15774,BOOK TENTH,"Grief call it not, 'twas anything but that,--"
15775,BOOK TENTH,"A conflict of sensations without name,                             290"
15776,BOOK TENTH,"Of which _he_ only, who may love the sight"
15777,BOOK TENTH,"Of a village steeple, as I do, can judge,"
15778,BOOK TENTH,"When, in the congregation bending all"
15779,BOOK TENTH,"To their great Father, prayers were offered up,"
15780,BOOK TENTH,Or praises for our country's victories;                            295
15781,BOOK TENTH,"And, 'mid the simple worshippers, perchance"
15782,BOOK TENTH,"I only, like an uninvited guest"
15783,BOOK TENTH,"Whom no one owned, sate silent; shall I add,"
15784,BOOK TENTH,Fed on the day of vengeance yet to come.
15785,BOOK TENTH,
15786,BOOK TENTH,"Oh! much have they to account for, who could tear,                 300"
15787,BOOK TENTH,"By violence, at one decisive rent,"
15788,BOOK TENTH,"From the best youth in England their dear pride,"
15789,BOOK TENTH,"Their joy, in England; this, too, at a time"
15790,BOOK TENTH,In which worst losses easily might wean
15791,BOOK TENTH,"The best of names, when patriotic love                             305"
15792,BOOK TENTH,"Did of itself in modesty give way,"
15793,BOOK TENTH,Like the Precursor when the Deity
15794,BOOK TENTH,Is come Whose harbinger he was; a time
15795,BOOK TENTH,In which apostasy from ancient faith
15796,BOOK TENTH,Seemed but conversion to a higher creed;                           310
15797,BOOK TENTH,"Withal a season dangerous and wild,"
15798,BOOK TENTH,A time when sage Experience would have snatched
15799,BOOK TENTH,Flowers out of any hedge-row to compose
15800,BOOK TENTH,A chaplet in contempt of his grey locks.
15801,BOOK TENTH,
15802,BOOK TENTH,When the proud fleet that bears the red-cross flag [R]             315
15803,BOOK TENTH,In that unworthy service was prepared
15804,BOOK TENTH,"To mingle, I beheld the vessels lie,"
15805,BOOK TENTH,"A brood of gallant creatures, on the deep;"
15806,BOOK TENTH,"I saw them in their rest, a sojourner"
15807,BOOK TENTH,Through a whole month of calm and glassy days                      320
15808,BOOK TENTH,In that delightful island which protects
15809,BOOK TENTH,"Their place of convocation [S]--there I heard,"
15810,BOOK TENTH,"Each evening, pacing by the still sea-shore,"
15811,BOOK TENTH,"A monitory sound that never failed,--"
15812,BOOK TENTH,The sunset cannon. While the orb went down                         325
15813,BOOK TENTH,"In the tranquillity of nature, came"
15814,BOOK TENTH,"That voice, ill requiem! seldom heard by me"
15815,BOOK TENTH,Without a spirit overcast by dark
15816,BOOK TENTH,"Imaginations, sense of woes to come,"
15817,BOOK TENTH,"Sorrow for human kind, and pain of heart.                          330"
15818,BOOK TENTH,
15819,BOOK TENTH,"In France, the men, who, for their desperate ends,"
15820,BOOK TENTH,"Had plucked up mercy by the roots, were glad"
15821,BOOK TENTH,"Of this new enemy. Tyrants, strong before"
15822,BOOK TENTH,"In wicked pleas, were strong as demons now;"
15823,BOOK TENTH,"And thus, on every side beset with foes,                           335"
15824,BOOK TENTH,The goaded land waxed mad; the crimes of few
15825,BOOK TENTH,Spread into madness of the many; blasts
15826,BOOK TENTH,From hell came sanctified like airs from heaven.
15827,BOOK TENTH,"The sternness of the just, the faith of those"
15828,BOOK TENTH,Who doubted not that Providence had times                          340
15829,BOOK TENTH,"Of vengeful retribution, theirs who throned"
15830,BOOK TENTH,The human Understanding paramount
15831,BOOK TENTH,"And made of that their God, [T] the hopes of men"
15832,BOOK TENTH,Who were content to barter short-lived pangs
15833,BOOK TENTH,"For a paradise of ages, the blind rage                             345"
15834,BOOK TENTH,"Of insolent tempers, the light vanity"
15835,BOOK TENTH,"Of intermeddlers, steady purposes"
15836,BOOK TENTH,"Of the suspicious, slips of the indiscreet,"
15837,BOOK TENTH,And all the accidents of life were pressed
15838,BOOK TENTH,"Into one service, busy with one work.                              350"
15839,BOOK TENTH,"The Senate stood aghast, her prudence quenched,"
15840,BOOK TENTH,"Her wisdom stifled, and her justice scared,"
15841,BOOK TENTH,Her frenzy only active to extol
15842,BOOK TENTH,"Past outrages, and shape the way for new,"
15843,BOOK TENTH,Which no one dared to oppose or mitigate.                          355
15844,BOOK TENTH,
15845,BOOK TENTH,Domestic carnage now filled the whole year
15846,BOOK TENTH,"With feast-days; old men from the chimney-nook,"
15847,BOOK TENTH,"The maiden from the bosom of her love,"
15848,BOOK TENTH,"The mother from the cradle of her babe,"
15849,BOOK TENTH,"The warrior from the field--all perished, all--360"
15850,BOOK TENTH,"Friends, enemies, of all parties, ages, ranks,"
15851,BOOK TENTH,"Head after head, and never heads enough"
15852,BOOK TENTH,"For those that bade them fall. They found their joy,"
15853,BOOK TENTH,"They made it proudly, eager as a child,"
15854,BOOK TENTH,(If like desires of innocent little ones                           365
15855,BOOK TENTH,"May with such heinous appetites be compared,)"
15856,BOOK TENTH,Pleased in some open field to exercise
15857,BOOK TENTH,A toy that mimics with revolving wings
15858,BOOK TENTH,The motion of a wind-mill; though the air
15859,BOOK TENTH,"Do of itself blow fresh, and make the vanes                        370"
15860,BOOK TENTH,"Spin in his eyesight, _that_ contents him not,"
15861,BOOK TENTH,"But, with the plaything at arm's length, he sets"
15862,BOOK TENTH,"His front against the blast, and runs amain,"
15863,BOOK TENTH,That it may whirl the faster.
15864,BOOK TENTH,Amid the depth
15865,BOOK TENTH,"Of those enormities, even thinking minds                           375"
15866,BOOK TENTH,"Forgot, at seasons, whence they had their being;"
15867,BOOK TENTH,Forgot that such a sound was ever heard
15868,BOOK TENTH,As Liberty upon earth: yet all beneath
15869,BOOK TENTH,"Her innocent authority was wrought,"
15870,BOOK TENTH,"Nor could have been, without her blessed name.                     380"
15871,BOOK TENTH,"The illustrious wife of Roland, in the hour"
15872,BOOK TENTH,"Of her composure, felt that agony,"
15873,BOOK TENTH,And gave it vent in her last words. [U] O Friend!
15874,BOOK TENTH,"It was a lamentable time for man,"
15875,BOOK TENTH,Whether a hope had e'er been his or not;                           385
15876,BOOK TENTH,A woful time for them whose hopes survived
15877,BOOK TENTH,The shock; most woful for those few who still
15878,BOOK TENTH,"Were flattered, and had trust in human kind:"
15879,BOOK TENTH,They had the deepest feeling of the grief.
15880,BOOK TENTH,Meanwhile the Invaders fared as they deserved:                     390
15881,BOOK TENTH,"The Herculean Commonwealth had put forth her arms,"
15882,BOOK TENTH,And throttled with an infant godhead's might
15883,BOOK TENTH,"The snakes about her cradle; that was well,"
15884,BOOK TENTH,And as it should be; yet no cure for them
15885,BOOK TENTH,Whose souls were sick with pain of what would be                   395
15886,BOOK TENTH,Hereafter brought in charge against mankind.
15887,BOOK TENTH,"Most melancholy at that time, O Friend!"
15888,BOOK TENTH,"Were my day-thoughts,--my nights were miserable;"
15889,BOOK TENTH,"Through months, through years, long after the last beat"
15890,BOOK TENTH,"Of those atrocities, the hour of sleep                             400"
15891,BOOK TENTH,"To me came rarely charged with natural gifts,"
15892,BOOK TENTH,Such ghastly visions had I of despair
15893,BOOK TENTH,"And tyranny, and implements of death;"
15894,BOOK TENTH,"And innocent victims sinking under fear,"
15895,BOOK TENTH,"And momentary hope, and worn-out prayer,                           405"
15896,BOOK TENTH,"Each in his separate cell, or penned in crowds"
15897,BOOK TENTH,"For sacrifice, and struggling with fond mirth"
15898,BOOK TENTH,"And levity in dungeons, where the dust"
15899,BOOK TENTH,Was laid with tears. Then suddenly the scene
15900,BOOK TENTH,"Changed, and the unbroken dream entangled me                       410"
15901,BOOK TENTH,"In long orations, which I strove to plead"
15902,BOOK TENTH,"Before unjust tribunals,--with a voice"
15903,BOOK TENTH,"Labouring, a brain confounded, and a sense,"
15904,BOOK TENTH,"Death-like, of treacherous desertion, felt"
15905,BOOK TENTH,In the last place of refuge--my own soul.                          415
15906,BOOK TENTH,
15907,BOOK TENTH,When I began in youth's delightful prime
15908,BOOK TENTH,"To yield myself to Nature, when that strong"
15909,BOOK TENTH,"And holy passion overcame me first,"
15910,BOOK TENTH,"Nor day nor night, evening or morn, was free"
15911,BOOK TENTH,"From its oppression. But, O Power Supreme!                         420"
15912,BOOK TENTH,"Without Whose call this world would cease to breathe,"
15913,BOOK TENTH,Who from the fountain of Thy grace dost fill
15914,BOOK TENTH,"The veins that branch through every frame of life,"
15915,BOOK TENTH,"Making man what he is, creature divine,"
15916,BOOK TENTH,"In single or in social eminence,                                   425"
15917,BOOK TENTH,Above the rest raised infinite ascents
15918,BOOK TENTH,When reason that enables him to be
15919,BOOK TENTH,Is not sequestered--what a change is here!
15920,BOOK TENTH,"How different ritual for this after-worship,"
15921,BOOK TENTH,What countenance to promote this second love!                      430
15922,BOOK TENTH,The first was service paid to things which lie
15923,BOOK TENTH,Guarded within the bosom of Thy will.
15924,BOOK TENTH,Therefore to serve was high beatitude;
15925,BOOK TENTH,"Tumult was therefore gladness, and the fear"
15926,BOOK TENTH,"Ennobling, venerable; sleep secure,                                435"
15927,BOOK TENTH,And waking thoughts more rich than happiest dreams.
15928,BOOK TENTH,
15929,BOOK TENTH,"But as the ancient Prophets, borne aloft"
15930,BOOK TENTH,"In vision, yet constrained by natural laws"
15931,BOOK TENTH,"With them to take a troubled human heart,"
15932,BOOK TENTH,"Wanted not consolations, nor a creed                               440"
15933,BOOK TENTH,"Of reconcilement, then when they denounced,"
15934,BOOK TENTH,"On towns and cities, wallowing in the abyss"
15935,BOOK TENTH,"Of their offences, punishment to come;"
15936,BOOK TENTH,"Or saw, like other men, with bodily eyes,"
15937,BOOK TENTH,"Before them, in some desolated place,                              445"
15938,BOOK TENTH,The wrath consummate and the threat fulfilled;
15939,BOOK TENTH,"So, with devout humility be it said,"
15940,BOOK TENTH,"So, did a portion of that spirit fall"
15941,BOOK TENTH,On me uplifted from the vantage-ground
15942,BOOK TENTH,Of pity and sorrow to a state of being                             450
15943,BOOK TENTH,That through the time's exceeding fierceness saw
15944,BOOK TENTH,"Glimpses of retribution, terrible,"
15945,BOOK TENTH,And in the order of sublime behests:
15946,BOOK TENTH,"But, even if that were not, amid the awe"
15947,BOOK TENTH,"Of unintelligible chastisement,                                    455"
15948,BOOK TENTH,Not only acquiescences of faith
15949,BOOK TENTH,"Survived, but daring sympathies with power,"
15950,BOOK TENTH,"Motions not treacherous or profane, else why"
15951,BOOK TENTH,Within the folds of no ungentle breast
15952,BOOK TENTH,Their dread vibration to this hour prolonged?                      460
15953,BOOK TENTH,Wild blasts of music thus could find their way
15954,BOOK TENTH,Into the midst of turbulent events;
15955,BOOK TENTH,So that worst tempests might be listened to.
15956,BOOK TENTH,"Then was the truth received into my heart,"
15957,BOOK TENTH,"That, under heaviest sorrow earth can bring,                       465"
15958,BOOK TENTH,If from the affliction somewhere do not grow
15959,BOOK TENTH,"Honour which could not else have been, a faith,"
15960,BOOK TENTH,"An elevation and a sanctity,"
15961,BOOK TENTH,"If new strength be not given nor old restored,"
15962,BOOK TENTH,"The blame is ours, not Nature's. When a taunt                      470"
15963,BOOK TENTH,"Was taken up by scoffers in their pride,"
15964,BOOK TENTH,"Saying, ""Behold the harvest that we reap"
15965,BOOK TENTH,"From popular government and equality,"""
15966,BOOK TENTH,I clearly saw that neither these nor aught
15967,BOOK TENTH,Of wild belief engrafted on their names                            475
15968,BOOK TENTH,"By false philosophy had caused the woe,"
15969,BOOK TENTH,But a terrific reservoir of guilt
15970,BOOK TENTH,"And ignorance rilled up from age to age,"
15971,BOOK TENTH,"That could no longer hold its loathsome charge,"
15972,BOOK TENTH,But burst and spread in deluge through the land.                   480
15973,BOOK TENTH,
15974,BOOK TENTH,"And as the desert hath green spots, the sea"
15975,BOOK TENTH,"Small islands scattered amid stormy waves,"
15976,BOOK TENTH,So that disastrous period did not want
15977,BOOK TENTH,"Bright sprinklings of all human excellence,"
15978,BOOK TENTH,To which the silver wands of saints in Heaven                      485
15979,BOOK TENTH,"Might point with rapturous joy. Yet not the less,"
15980,BOOK TENTH,For those examples in no age surpassed
15981,BOOK TENTH,"Of fortitude and energy and love,"
15982,BOOK TENTH,And human nature faithful to herself
15983,BOOK TENTH,"Under worst trials, was I driven to think                          490"
15984,BOOK TENTH,Of the glad times when first I traversed France
15985,BOOK TENTH,A youthful pilgrim; [V] above all reviewed
15986,BOOK TENTH,"That eventide, when under windows bright"
15987,BOOK TENTH,"With happy faces and with garlands hung,"
15988,BOOK TENTH,"And through a rainbow-arch that spanned the street,                495"
15989,BOOK TENTH,"Triumphal pomp for liberty confirmed, [W]"
15990,BOOK TENTH,"I paced, a dear companion at my side,"
15991,BOOK TENTH,"The town of Arras, [X] whence with promise high"
15992,BOOK TENTH,"Issued, on delegation to sustain"
15993,BOOK TENTH,"Humanity and right, _that_ Robespierre,                            500"
15994,BOOK TENTH,"He who thereafter, and in how short time!"
15995,BOOK TENTH,Wielded the sceptre of the Atheist crew.
15996,BOOK TENTH,When the calamity spread far and wide--
15997,BOOK TENTH,"And this same city, that did then appear"
15998,BOOK TENTH,"To outrun the rest in exultation, groaned                          505"
15999,BOOK TENTH,"Under the vengeance of her cruel son,"
16000,BOOK TENTH,As Lear reproached the winds--I could almost
16001,BOOK TENTH,Have quarrelled with that blameless spectacle
16002,BOOK TENTH,For lingering yet an image in my mind
16003,BOOK TENTH,To mock me under such a strange reverse.                           510
16004,BOOK TENTH,
16005,BOOK TENTH,O Friend! few happier moments have been mine
16006,BOOK TENTH,Than that which told the downfall of this Tribe
16007,BOOK TENTH,"So dreaded, so abhorred. [Y] The day deserves"
16008,BOOK TENTH,A separate record. Over the smooth sands
16009,BOOK TENTH,Of Leven's ample estuary lay                                       515
16010,BOOK TENTH,"My journey, and beneath a genial sun,"
16011,BOOK TENTH,With distant prospect among gleams of sky
16012,BOOK TENTH,"And clouds, and intermingling mountain tops,"
16013,BOOK TENTH,"In one inseparable glory clad,"
16014,BOOK TENTH,Creatures of one ethereal substance met                            520
16015,BOOK TENTH,"In consistory, like a diadem"
16016,BOOK TENTH,Or crown of burning seraphs as they sit
16017,BOOK TENTH,In the empyrean. Underneath that pomp
16018,BOOK TENTH,"Celestial, lay unseen the pastoral vales"
16019,BOOK TENTH,Among whose happy fields I had grown up                            525
16020,BOOK TENTH,"From childhood. On the fulgent spectacle,"
16021,BOOK TENTH,"That neither passed away nor changed, I gazed"
16022,BOOK TENTH,Enrapt; but brightest things are wont to draw
16023,BOOK TENTH,"Sad opposites out of the inner heart,"
16024,BOOK TENTH,As even their pensive influence drew from mine.                    530
16025,BOOK TENTH,How could it otherwise? for not in vain
16026,BOOK TENTH,That very morning had I turned aside
16027,BOOK TENTH,"To seek the ground where, 'mid a throng of graves,"
16028,BOOK TENTH,"An honoured teacher of my youth was laid, [Z]"
16029,BOOK TENTH,And on the stone were graven by his desire                         535
16030,BOOK TENTH,Lines from the churchyard elegy of Gray. [a]
16031,BOOK TENTH,"This faithful guide, speaking from his death-bed,"
16032,BOOK TENTH,"Added no farewell to his parting counsel,"
16033,BOOK TENTH,"But said to me, ""My head will soon lie low;"""
16034,BOOK TENTH,"And when I saw the turf that covered him,                          540"
16035,BOOK TENTH,"After the lapse of full eight years, [b] those words,"
16036,BOOK TENTH,"With sound of voice and countenance of the Man,"
16037,BOOK TENTH,"Came back upon me, so that some few tears"
16038,BOOK TENTH,Fell from me in my own despite. But now
16039,BOOK TENTH,"I thought, still traversing that widespread plain,                 545"
16040,BOOK TENTH,With tender pleasure of the verses graven
16041,BOOK TENTH,"Upon his tombstone, whispering to myself:"
16042,BOOK TENTH,"He loved the Poets, and, if now alive,"
16043,BOOK TENTH,"Would have loved me, as one not destitute"
16044,BOOK TENTH,"Of promise, nor belying the kind hope                              550"
16045,BOOK TENTH,"That he had formed, when I, at his command,"
16046,BOOK TENTH,"Began to spin, with toil, my earliest songs. [c]"
16047,BOOK TENTH,
16048,BOOK TENTH,"As I advanced, all that I saw or felt"
16049,BOOK TENTH,Was gentleness and peace. Upon a small
16050,BOOK TENTH,"And rocky island near, a fragment stood                            555"
16051,BOOK TENTH,(Itself like a sea rock) the low remains
16052,BOOK TENTH,"(With shells encrusted, dark with briny weeds)"
16053,BOOK TENTH,"Of a dilapidated structure, once"
16054,BOOK TENTH,"A Romish chapel, [d] where the vested priest"
16055,BOOK TENTH,Said matins at the hour that suited those                          560
16056,BOOK TENTH,Who crossed the sands with ebb of morning tide.
16057,BOOK TENTH,Not far from that still ruin all the plain
16058,BOOK TENTH,Lay spotted with a variegated crowd
16059,BOOK TENTH,"Of vehicles and travellers, horse and foot,"
16060,BOOK TENTH,Wading beneath the conduct of their guide                          565
16061,BOOK TENTH,In loose procession through the shallow stream
16062,BOOK TENTH,Of inland waters; the great sea meanwhile
16063,BOOK TENTH,"Heaved at safe distance, far retired. I paused,"

16409,BOOK ELEVENTH.,
16410,BOOK ELEVENTH.,But from these bitter truths I must return
16411,BOOK ELEVENTH.,To my own history. It hath been told                                75
16412,BOOK ELEVENTH.,That I was led to take an eager part
16413,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"In arguments of civil polity,"
16414,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Abruptly, and indeed before my time:"
16415,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"I had approached, like other youths, the shield"
16416,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Of human nature from the golden side,                               80"
16417,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And would have fought, even to the death, to attest"
16418,BOOK ELEVENTH.,The quality of the metal which I saw.
16419,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"What there is best in individual man,"
16420,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Of wise in passion, and sublime in power,"
16421,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Benevolent in small societies,                                      85"
16422,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And great in large ones, I had oft revolved,"
16423,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Felt deeply, but not thoroughly understood"
16424,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"By reason: nay, far from it; they were yet,"
16425,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"As cause was given me afterwards to learn,"
16426,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Not proof against the injuries of the day;                          90
16427,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Lodged only at the sanctuary's door,"
16428,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Not safe within its bosom. Thus prepared,"
16429,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And with such general insight into evil,"
16430,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And of the bounds which sever it from good,"
16431,BOOK ELEVENTH.,As books and common intercourse with life                           95
16432,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Must needs have given--to the inexperienced mind,"
16433,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"When the world travels in a beaten road,"
16434,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Guide faithful as is needed--I began
16435,BOOK ELEVENTH.,To meditate with ardour on the rule
16436,BOOK ELEVENTH.,And management of nations; what it is                              100
16437,BOOK ELEVENTH.,And ought to be; and strove to learn how far
16438,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Their power or weakness, wealth or poverty,"
16439,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Their happiness or misery, depends"
16440,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Upon their laws, and fashion of the State."
16441,BOOK ELEVENTH.,
16442,BOOK ELEVENTH.,O pleasant exercise of hope and joy! [C]                         105
16443,BOOK ELEVENTH.,For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood
16444,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Upon our side, us who were strong in love!"
16445,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,"
16446,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"But to be young was very Heaven! [D] O times,"

16448,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Of custom, law, and statute, took at once"
16449,BOOK ELEVENTH.,The attraction of a country in romance!
16450,BOOK ELEVENTH.,When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights
16451,BOOK ELEVENTH.,When most intent on making of herself
16452,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"A prime enchantress--to assist the work,                           115"
16453,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Which then was going forward in her name!
16454,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Not favoured spots alone, but the whole Earth,"
16455,BOOK ELEVENTH.,The beauty wore of promise--that which sets
16456,BOOK ELEVENTH.,(As at some moments might not be unfelt
16457,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Among the bowers of Paradise itself)                               120
16458,BOOK ELEVENTH.,The budding rose above the rose full blown.
16459,BOOK ELEVENTH.,What temper at the prospect did not wake
16460,BOOK ELEVENTH.,To happiness unthought of? The inert
16461,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!"
16462,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,                      125"
16463,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"The play-fellows of fancy, who had made"

16465,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Their ministers,--who in lordly wise had stirred"
16466,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Among the grandest objects of the sense,"
16467,BOOK ELEVENTH.,And dealt with whatsoever they found there                         130
16468,BOOK ELEVENTH.,As if they had within some lurking right
16469,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"To wield it;--they, too, who of gentle mood"
16470,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Had watched all gentle motions, and to these"
16471,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,"
16472,BOOK ELEVENTH.,And in the region of their peaceful selves;--135
16473,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Now was it that _both_ found, the meek and lofty"
16474,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Did both find helpers to their hearts' desire,"
16475,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish,--"
16476,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Were called upon to exercise their skill,"
16477,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Not in Utopia,--subterranean fields,--140"
16478,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!"
16479,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"But in the very world, which is the world"
16480,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Of all of us,--the place where, in the end,"
16481,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"We find our happiness, or not at all!"
16482,BOOK ELEVENTH.,
16483,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Why should I not confess that Earth was then                     145
16484,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"To me, what an inheritance, new-fallen,"
16485,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Seems, when the first time visited, to one"
16486,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Who thither comes to find in it his home?
16487,BOOK ELEVENTH.,He walks about and looks upon the spot

16489,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And is half pleased with things that are amiss,"

16492,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"An active partisan, I thus convoked"

16496,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"When erring, erring on the better part,"
16497,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And in the kinder spirit; placable,"
16498,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Indulgent, as not uninformed that men"

16500,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Gives rights to error; and aware, no less,"
16501,BOOK ELEVENTH.,That throwing off oppression must be work
16502,BOOK ELEVENTH.,As well of License as of Liberty;
16503,BOOK ELEVENTH.,And above all--for this was more than all--
16504,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Not caring if the wind did now and then                            165
16505,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Blow keen upon an eminence that gave
16506,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Prospect so large into futurity;
16507,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"In brief, a child of Nature, as at first,"
16508,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Diffusing only those affections wider
16509,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"That from the cradle had grown up with me,                         170"
16510,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And losing, in no other way than light"
16511,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Is lost in light, the weak in the more strong."
16512,BOOK ELEVENTH.,
16513,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"In the main outline, such it might be said"
16514,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Was my condition, till with open war"
16515,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Britain opposed the liberties of France. [E]                       175
16516,BOOK ELEVENTH.,This threw me first out of the pale of love;
16517,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Soured and corrupted, upwards to the source,"
16518,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"My sentiments; was not, as hitherto,"
16519,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"A swallowing up of lesser things in great,"
16520,BOOK ELEVENTH.,But change of them into their contraries;                          180
16521,BOOK ELEVENTH.,And thus a way was opened for mistakes
16522,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And false conclusions, in degree as gross,"
16523,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"In kind more dangerous. What had been a pride,"
16524,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Was now a shame; my likings and my loves
16525,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Ran in new channels, leaving old ones dry;                         185"
16526,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And hence a blow that, in maturer age,"
16527,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Would but have touched the judgment, struck more deep"
16528,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Into sensations near the heart: meantime,"
16529,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"As from the first, wild theories were afloat,"
16530,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"To whose pretensions, sedulously urged,                            190"
16531,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"I had but lent a careless ear, assured"
16532,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"That time was ready to set all things right,"
16533,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"And that the multitude, so long oppressed,"
16534,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Would be oppressed no more.
16535,BOOK ELEVENTH.,
16536,BOOK ELEVENTH.,But when events
16537,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Brought less encouragement, and unto these                         195"
16538,BOOK ELEVENTH.,The immediate proof of principles no more
16539,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Could be entrusted, while the events themselves,"
16540,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Worn out in greatness, stripped of novelty,"
16541,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Less occupied the mind, and sentiments"
16542,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Could through my understanding's natural growth                    200
16543,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"No longer keep their ground, by faith maintained"

16546,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Safer, of universal application, such"

16548,BOOK ELEVENTH.,
16549,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"But now, become oppressors in their turn,"
16550,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Frenchmen had changed a war of self-defence

16553,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Openly in the eye of earth and heaven,                             210"
16554,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"The scale of liberty. I read her doom,"
16555,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"With anger vexed, with disappointment sore,"
16556,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"But not dismayed, nor taking to the shame"
16557,BOOK ELEVENTH.,Of a false prophet. While resentment rose
16558,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Striving to hide, what nought could heal, the wounds               215"
16559,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Of mortified presumption, I adhered"
16560,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"More firmly to old tenets, and, to prove"
16561,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Their temper, strained them more; and thus, in heat"
16562,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Of contest, did opinions every day"

16570,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Out of his feelings, to be fixed thenceforth"
16571,BOOK ELEVENTH.,For ever in a purer element--

16575,BOOK ELEVENTH.,And never hear the sound of their own names.
16576,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"But, speaking more in charity, the dream"
16577,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Flattered the young, pleased with extremes, nor least"
16578,BOOK ELEVENTH.,With that which makes our Reason's naked self

16580,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"How glorious! in self-knowledge and self-rule,"

16590,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"From her first ground expelled, grew proud once more."
16591,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Oft, as my thoughts were turned to human kind,"

16595,BOOK ELEVENTH.,A more exalted nature; wished that Man
16596,BOOK ELEVENTH.,"Should start out of his earthy, worm-like state,"

17319,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"[Footnote F: The year was evidently 1783, but the locality is difficult"
17320,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,to determine. It may have been one or other of two places. Wordsworth's
17321,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"father died at Penrith, and it was there that the sons went for their"
17322,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,Christmas holiday. The road from Penrith to Hawkshead was by Kirkstone
17323,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"Pass, and Ambleside; and the ""led palfreys"" sent to take the boys home"
17324,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,would certainly come through the latter town. Now there are only two
17325,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"roads from Ambleside to Hawkshead, which meet at a point about a mile"
17326,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"north of Hawkshead, called in the Ordnance map ""Outgate."" The eastern"
17327,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"road is now chiefly used by carriages, being less hilly and better made"
17328,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,than the western one. The latter would be quite as convenient as the
17329,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,former for horses. If one were to walk out from Hawkshead village to the
17330,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"place where the two roads separate at ""Outgate,"" and then ascend the"
17331,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"ridge between them, he would find several places from which he could"
17332,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"overlook _both_ roads ""far stretched,"" were the view not now intercepted"
17333,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,by numerous plantations. (The latter are of comparatively recent
17334,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"growth.) Dr. Cradock,--to whom I am indebted for this, and for many"

17337,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,

17339,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"about three-quarters of a mile from their point of divergence, answers"
17340,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,the description as well as any other. It may be nearly two miles from
17341,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"Hawkshead, a distance of which an active eager school-boy would think"
17342,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,nothing. The 'blasted hawthorn' and the 'naked wall' are probably
17343,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"things of the past as much as the 'single sheep.'"""
17344,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,
17345,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"Doubtless this may be the spot,--a green, rocky knoll with a steep face"
17346,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"to the north, where a quarry is wrought, and with a plantation to the"
17347,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,east. It commands a view of both roads. The other possible place is a
17348,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"crag, not a quarter of a mile from Outgate, a little to the right of the"
17349,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,place where the two roads divide. A low wall runs up across it to the
17350,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"top, dividing a plantation of oak, hazel, and ash, from the firs that"
17351,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"crown the summit. These firs, which are larch and spruce, seem all of"
17352,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,this century. The top of the crag may have been bare when Wordsworth
17353,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,lived at Hawkshead. But at the foot of the path along the dividing wall
17354,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,there are a few (probably older) trees; and a solitary walk beneath
17355,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"them, at noon or dusk, is almost as suggestive to the imagination, as"
17356,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"repose under the yews of Borrowdale, listening to ""the mountain flood"""
17357,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,on Glaramara. There one may still hear the bleak music from the old

17359,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"whistles through the underwood, or moans amid the fir trees of the Crag,"
17360,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"on the summit of which there is a ""blasted hawthorn"" tree. It may be"

17444,BOOK THIRTEENTH,The promise of the present time retired
17445,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Into its true proportion; sanguine schemes,                         60"
17446,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Ambitious projects, pleased me less; I sought"
17447,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"For present good in life's familiar face,"
17448,BOOK THIRTEENTH,And built thereon my hopes of good to come.
17449,BOOK THIRTEENTH,
17450,BOOK THIRTEENTH,With settling judgments now of what would last
17451,BOOK THIRTEENTH,And what would disappear; prepared to find                          65
17452,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Presumption, folly, madness, in the men"
17453,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Who thrust themselves upon the passive world
17454,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"As Rulers of the world; to see in these,"
17455,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Even when the public welfare is their aim,"
17456,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Plans without thought, or built on theories                         70"
17457,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Vague and unsound; and having brought the books
17458,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Of modern statists to their proper test,"
17459,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Life, human life, with all its sacred claims"
17460,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Of sex and age, and heaven-descended rights,"

17462,BOOK THIRTEENTH,And having thus discerned how dire a thing

17464,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"""The Wealth of Nations,"" _where_ alone that wealth"

17467,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"And dignity of individual man,"
17468,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"No composition of the brain, but man"
17469,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Of whom we read, the man whom we behold"
17470,BOOK THIRTEENTH,With our own eyes--I could not but inquire--
17471,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Not with less interest than heretofore,                             85"
17472,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"But greater, though in spirit more subdued--"
17473,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Why is this glorious creature to be found
17474,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"One only in ten thousand? What one is,"
17475,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Why may not millions be? What bars are thrown
17476,BOOK THIRTEENTH,By Nature in the way of such a hope?                                90
17477,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Our animal appetites and daily wants,"
17478,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Are these obstructions insurmountable?

17480,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"""Inspect the basis of the social pile:"

17487,BOOK THIRTEENTH,I chiefly looked (what need to look beyond?)
17488,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Among the natural abodes of men,"
17489,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Fields with their rural works; [B] recalled to mind
17490,BOOK THIRTEENTH,My earliest notices; with these compared
17491,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"The observations made in later youth,                              105"
17492,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"And to that day continued.--For, the time"
17493,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Had never been when throes of mighty Nations
17494,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"And the world's tumult unto me could yield,"
17495,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"How far soe'er transported and possessed,"
17496,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Full measure of content; but still I craved                        110
17497,BOOK THIRTEENTH,An intermingling of distinct regards
17498,BOOK THIRTEENTH,And truths of individual sympathy
17499,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Nearer ourselves. Such often might be gleaned
17500,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"From the great City, else it must have proved"
17501,BOOK THIRTEENTH,To me a heart-depressing wilderness;                               115
17502,BOOK THIRTEENTH,But much was wanting: therefore did I turn
17503,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"To you, ye pathways, and ye lonely roads;"
17504,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Sought you enriched with everything I prized,"
17505,BOOK THIRTEENTH,With human kindnesses and simple joys.
17506,BOOK THIRTEENTH,
17507,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Oh! next to one dear state of bliss, vouchsafed                  120"
17508,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Alas! to few in this untoward world,"
17509,BOOK THIRTEENTH,The bliss of walking daily in life's prime

17513,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Deep vale, or any where, the home of both,"
17514,BOOK THIRTEENTH,From which it would be misery to stir:
17515,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Oh! next to such enjoyment of our youth,"
17516,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"In my esteem, next to such dear delight,"
17517,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Was that of wandering on from day to day                           130
17518,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Where I could meditate in peace, and cull"
17519,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Knowledge that step by step might lead me on
17520,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"To wisdom; or, as lightsome as a bird"
17521,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Wafted upon the wind from distant lands,"
17522,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Sing notes of greeting to strange fields or groves,                135"
17523,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Which lacked not voice to welcome me in turn:

17525,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Converse with men, where if we meet a face"
17526,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"We almost meet a friend, on naked heaths"
17527,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"With long long ways before, by cottage bench,                      140"
17528,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Or well-spring where the weary traveller rests.

17534,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Of childhood, when a disappearing line,"
17535,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"One daily present to my eyes, that crossed"
17536,BOOK THIRTEENTH,The naked summit of a far-off hill
17537,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Beyond the limits that my feet had trod,"
17538,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Was like an invitation into space                                  150
17539,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Boundless, or guide into eternity. [C]"

17545,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Awed have I been by strolling Bedlamites;
17546,BOOK THIRTEENTH,From many other uncouth vagrants (passed

17549,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"To watch and question those I met, and speak"
17550,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Without reserve to them, the lonely roads"
17551,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Were open schools in which I daily read
17552,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"With most delight the passions of mankind,"
17553,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Whether by words, looks, sighs, or tears, revealed;                165"
17554,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"There saw into the depth of human souls,"
17555,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Souls that appear to have no depth at all

17557,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"How little those formalities, to which"
17558,BOOK THIRTEENTH,With overweening trust alone we give                               170
17559,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"The name of Education, have to do"
17560,BOOK THIRTEENTH,With real feeling and just sense; how vain
17561,BOOK THIRTEENTH,A correspondence with the talking world
17562,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Proves to the most; and called to make good search
17563,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"If man's estate, by doom of Nature yoked                           175"
17564,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"With toil, be therefore yoked with ignorance;"
17565,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"If virtue be indeed so hard to rear,"
17566,BOOK THIRTEENTH,And intellectual strength so rare a boon--

17570,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"To every angry passion. There I heard,"
17571,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"From mouths of men obscure and lowly, truths"
17572,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Replete with honour; sounds in unison
17573,BOOK THIRTEENTH,With loftiest promises of good and fair.                           185
17574,BOOK THIRTEENTH,
17575,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"There are who think that strong affection, love [D]"
17576,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Known by whatever name, is falsely deemed"
17577,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"A gift, to use a term which they would use,"
17578,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Of vulgar nature; that its growth requires
17579,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Retirement, leisure, language purified                             190"
17580,BOOK THIRTEENTH,By manners studied and elaborate;
17581,BOOK THIRTEENTH,That whoso feels such passion in its strength

17589,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Of the affections, and to Nature's self                            200"
17590,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Oppose a deeper nature; there, indeed,"
17591,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Love cannot be; nor does it thrive with ease

17594,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"And the eye feeds it not, and cannot feed.                         205"
17595,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"--Yes, in those wanderings deeply did I feel"
17596,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"How we mislead each other; above all,"
17597,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"How books mislead us, seeking their reward"
17598,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"From judgments of the wealthy Few, who see"

17677,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Grandeur upon the very humblest face
17678,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Of human life. I felt that the array
17679,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Of act and circumstance, and visible form,"
17680,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Is mainly to the pleasure of the mind
17681,BOOK THIRTEENTH,What passion makes them; that meanwhile the forms                  290
17682,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Of Nature have a passion in themselves,"
17683,BOOK THIRTEENTH,That intermingles with those works of man
17684,BOOK THIRTEENTH,To which she summons him; although the works
17685,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Be mean, have nothing lofty of their own;"
17686,BOOK THIRTEENTH,And that the Genius of the Poet hence                              295
17687,BOOK THIRTEENTH,May boldly take his way among mankind
17688,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Wherever Nature leads; that he hath stood
17689,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"By Nature's side among the men of old,"
17690,BOOK THIRTEENTH,And so shall stand for ever. Dearest Friend!

17697,BOOK THIRTEENTH,The humblest of this band who dares to hope

17699,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"An insight that in some sort he possesses,"
17700,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"A privilege whereby a work of his,"

17702,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Creative and enduring, may become"
17703,BOOK THIRTEENTH,A power like one of Nature's. To a hope
17704,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Not less ambitious once among the wilds
17705,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Of Sarum's Plain, [E] my youthful spirit was raised;"
17706,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"There, as I ranged at will the pastoral downs                      315"
17707,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Trackless and smooth, or paced the bare white roads"
17708,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Lengthening in solitude their dreary line,"
17709,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Time with his retinue of ages fled
17710,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Backwards, nor checked his flight until I saw"
17711,BOOK THIRTEENTH,Our dim ancestral Past in vision clear;                            320
17712,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Saw multitudes of men, and, here and there,"
17713,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"A single Briton clothed in wolf-skin vest,"
17714,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"With shield and stone-axe, stride across the wold;"

17717,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Long mouldered, of barbaric majesty."
17718,BOOK THIRTEENTH,I called on Darkness--but before the word
17719,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"Was uttered, midnight darkness seemed to take"
17720,BOOK THIRTEENTH,All objects from my sight; and lo! again
17721,BOOK THIRTEENTH,The Desert visible by dismal flames;                               330
17722,BOOK THIRTEENTH,"It is the sacrificial altar, fed"

17821,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"it might be the road from Cockermouth to Bridekirk, he wrote (July"

17823,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,

17827,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,nor from the garden behind it. This garden extends from the house to
17828,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"the river Derwent, from which it is separated by a wall, with a raised"
17829,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"terraced walk on the inner side, and nearly on a level with the top. I"
17830,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,understand that this terrace was in existence in the poet's time....
17831,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,Its direction is nearly due east and west; and looking eastward from
17832,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"it, there is a hill which bounds the view in that direction, and which"

17834,FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT,"and a half to two miles distant, of considerable height, is bare and"

18772,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Mr. Rawnsley, formerly of Wray Vicarage--now Canon Rawnsley of"
18773,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Crosthwaite Vicarage, Keswick--sent me the following letter in reference"
18774,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,to:
18775,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18776,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18777,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"... that unruly child of mountain birth,"
18778,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"The famous brook, who, soon as he was boxed"
18779,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Within our garden, found himself at once,"
18780,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"As if by trick insidious and unkind,"
18781,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,Stripped of his voice and left to dimple down
18782,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,...
18783,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"I looked at him and smiled, and smiled again,"
18784,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,...
18785,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"'Ha,' quoth I, 'pretty prisoner, are you there!'"
18786,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18787,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18788,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"""I was not quite content with Dr. Cradock's identification of this"
18789,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"brook, or of the garden; partly because, beyond the present garden"
18790,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"square I found, on going up the brook, other garden squares, which"
18791,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,were much more likely to have been the garden belonging to Anne
18792,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Tyson's cottage, and because in these garden plots the stream was not"
18793,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"'stripped of his voice,' by the covering of Coniston flags, as is the"
18794,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,case lower down towards the market place; and partly because--as you
18795,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,notice--you can both hear and see the stream through the interstices
18796,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"of the flags, and that it can hardly be described (by one who will"
18797,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,listen) as stripped of its voice.
18798,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18799,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,At the same time I was bound to admit that in comparing the voice of
18800,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,the stream here in the 'channel paved by man's officious care' with
18801,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"the sound of it up in the fields beyond the vicarage, nearer its"
18802,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"birth-place, it certainly might be said to be softer voiced; and as"
18803,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"the poet speaks of it as 'that unruly child of mountain birth,' it"
18804,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,looks as if he too had realised the difference.
18805,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18806,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,But whilst I thought that the identification of Dr. Cradock and
18807,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"yourself was very happy (in absence of other possibilities), I had not"
18808,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"thought that Wordsworth would describe the stream as 'dimpling down,'"
18809,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,or address it as a 'pretty prisoner.' A smaller stream seemed
18810,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,necessary.
18811,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18812,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"It was, therefore, not a little curious that, in poking about among"
18813,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"the garden plots on the west bank of the stream, fronting (as nearly"
18814,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"as I could judge) Anne Tyson's cottage, to seek for remains of the ash"
18815,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"tree, in which so often the poet--as he lay awake on summer"
18816,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"nights--had watched 'the moon in splendour couched among the leaves,'"
18817,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"rocking 'with every impulse of the breeze,' I not only stumbled upon"
18818,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,the remains of an ash tree--now a 'pollard'--which is evidently
18819,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,sprung from a larger tree since decayed (and which for all I know may
18820,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,be one of the actual parts of the ancient tree itself); but also had
18821,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"the good luck to fall into conversation with a certain Isaac Hodgson,"
18822,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,who volunteered the following information.
18823,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18824,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"First, that Wordsworth, it was commonly said, had lodged part of his"
18825,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"time with one Betty Braithwaite, in the very house called Church Hill"
18826,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,House.
18827,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18828,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"She was a widow, and kept a confectionery shop, and 'did a deal of"
18829,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"baking,' he believed."
18830,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18831,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Secondly, that there was a little patch of garden at the back of the"
18832,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"house, with a famous spring well--still called Old Betty's Well--in"
18833,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"it, and that only a few paces from where I was then standing by the"
18834,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,pollard ash.
18835,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18836,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,On jumping over the fence I found myself on the western side of the
18837,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"quaint old Church Hill House, with magnificent views of the whole of"
18838,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,the western side of Hawkshead Vale; grassy swell and wooded rises
18839,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,taking the eye up to the moorland ridge between us and Coniston.
18840,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18841,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"'But,' said I, 'what about Betty's Well.' 'Oh,' said my friend,"
18842,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"'that's a noted spring, that never freezes, and always runs; we all"
18843,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"drink of it, and neighbours send to it. Here it is,' he continued;"
18844,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"and, gazing down, I saw a little dripping well of water, lustrous,"
18845,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"clear, coming evidently in continuous force from the springs or secret"
18846,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"channels up hill, pausing for a moment at the trough, thence falling"
18847,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"into a box or 'channel paved by man's officious care,' and in a moment"
18848,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"out of sight and soundless, to pursue its way, 'stripped of its"
18849,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"voice,' towards the main Town beck, that ran at the north-east border"
18850,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"of the garden plot. 'Ha, pretty prisoner,' and the words 'dimple down'"
18851,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,came to my mind at once as appropriate. 'Old Betty's Well gave the
18852,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,key-note of the 'famous brook'; and 'boxed within our garden' seemed
18853,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,an appropriate and exact description.

18856,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,'the sunny seat
18857,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Round the stone table under the dark pine,'"
18858,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18859,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"was there none. Not so, however, the Ash tree, the remains of which I"
18860,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,have spoken of. From the bedroom of Betty Braithwaite's house the boy
18861,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"could have watched the moon,"
18862,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18863,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,'while to and fro
18864,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,In the dark summit of the waving tree
18865,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,She rocked with every impulse of the breeze.'
18866,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18867,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"'In old times,' said my friend, 'the wall fence ran across the garden,"
18868,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"just beyond this spring well, so you see it was but a small spot, was"
18869,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,this garden close.' Yes; but the
18870,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18871,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,'crowd of things
18872,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"About its narrow precincts all beloved,'"
18873,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18874,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"were known the better, and loved the more on that account. Certainly,"
18875,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"thought I to myself, here is the famous spring; a brook that"
18876,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Wordsworth must have known, and that may have been the centre of"
18877,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"memory to him in his description of those early Hawkshead days, with"
18878,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,its metaphor of fountain life.
18879,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18880,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"May we not, as we gaze on this little fountain well, in a garden plot"
18881,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"at the back of one of the grey huts of this 'one dear vale,' point as"
18882,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"with a wand, and say,"
18883,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18884,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,'This portion of the river of his mind
18885,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,Came from yon fountain.'
18886,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18887,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,Is it not possible that the old dame whose

18889,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"'Clear though shallow stream of piety,"
18890,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Ran on the Sabbath days a fresher course,'"
18891,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18892,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"was Betty Braithwaite, the aged dame who owned the cottage hard by?"""
18893,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18894,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18895,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,The following additional extract from a letter of Mr. Rawnsley's
18896,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"(Christmas, 1882) casts light, both on the Hawkshead beck and fountain,"
18897,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"and on the stone seat in the market square, referred to in the fourth"
18898,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,book of 'The Prelude'.
18899,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18900,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"""Postlethwaite of the Sun Inn at Hawkshead, has a father aged 82, who"
18901,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"can remember that there was a _stone_ bench, not called old Betty's,"
18902,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"but Old Jane's Stone, on which she used to spread nuts and cakes for"
18903,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"the scholars of the Grammar School, but that it did not stand where"
18904,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"the Market Hall now is, and no one ever remembers a stone or"
18905,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,stone-bench standing there. This stone or stone-bench stood about
18906,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"opposite the Red Lion inn, in front of the little row of houses that"
18907,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"run east and west, just as you pass out of the village in a northerly"
18908,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,direction by the Red Lion. This stone or stone-bench is not associated
18909,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"with dark pine trees, but they may have passed away root and branch in"
18910,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,an earlier generation.
18911,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18912,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Next and most interesting, I think, as showing that I was right in the"
18913,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"matter of the _famous fountain,_ or spring in the garden, behind Betty"
18914,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,Braithwaite's house. There exists in Hawkshead near this house a
18915,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"covered-in place or shed, to which all the village repair for their"
18916,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"drinking-water, and always have done so. It is known by the name of"
18917,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"the Spout House, and the water--which flows all the year from a"
18918,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"longish spout, with an overflow one by its side--comes direct from the"
18919,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"little drop well in Betty B.'s garden, after having its voice stripped"
18920,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"and boxed therein; and, falling out of the spout into a deep stone"
18921,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"basin and culvert, runs through the town to join the Town Beck."
18922,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18923,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"So wedded are the Hawkshead folk to this, their familiar fountainhead,"
18924,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"that though water is supplied in stand-pipes now from a Reservoir, the"
18925,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"folks won't have it, and come here to this spout-house, bucket and jug"
18926,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"in hand, morn, noon and night. I have never seen anything so like a"
18927,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,continental scene at the gathering at Hawkshead spout-house.
18928,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,
18929,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"Lastly, there is a very aged thorn-tree in the churchyard--blown over"
18930,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,but propped up--in which the forefathers of the hamlet used to sit as
18931,NOTE II.--THE HAWKSHEAD BECK,"boys (in the thorn, that is, not the churchyard), and which has been"

18952,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,
18953,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,If the farm-house where Wordsworth spent the evening before this
18954,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"memorable morning walk was either at Elterwater or High Arnside, and the"
18955,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"homeward pathway led across the ridge of Ironkeld, either by the old"
18956,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"mountain road (now almost disused), or over the pathless fells, there"
18957,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,are two points from either of which the sea might be seen in the
18958,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,distance. The one is from the heights looking down to the Duddon
18959,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"estuary, across the Coniston valley; the other is from a spot nearer"
18960,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"Hawkshead, where Morecambe Bay is visible. In the former case ""the"
18961,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"meadows and the lower grounds"" would be those in Yewdale; in the latter"
18962,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"case, they would be those between Latterbarrow and Hawkshead; and, on"
18963,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"either alternative, the ""solid mountains"" would be those of the Coniston"
18964,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,group--the Old Man and Wetherlam. It is also possible that the course of
18965,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"the walk was over the Latterbarrow fells, or heights of Colthouse; but,"
18966,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"from the reference to the sunrise ""not unseen"" from the copse and field,"
18967,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"through which the ""homeward pathway wound,"" it may be supposed that the"
18968,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"course was south-east, and therefore not over these fells, when his back"
18969,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,would have been to the sun. Dr. Cradock's note [Footnote T to book iv]
18970,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"to the text (p. 197) sums up all that can ""be safely said""; but Mr."
18971,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,Rawnsley has supplied me with the following interesting remarks:
18972,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,
18973,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"""After a careful reading of the passage describing the poet's return"
18974,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"from a festal night, spent in some farm-house beyond the hills, I am"
18975,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,quite unable to say that the path from High Arnside over the Ironkeld
18976,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,range entirely suits the description. Is it not possible that the lad
18977,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"had school-fellows whose parents lived in Yewdale? If he had, and was"
18978,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"returning from the party in one of the Yewdale farms, he would, as he"
18979,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"ascended towards Tarn Howes, and faced about south, to gain the main"
18980,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"Coniston road, by traversing the meadows between Berwick ground and"
18981,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"the top of the Hawkshead and Coniston Hill, command a view of the sea"
18982,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"that 'lay laughing at a distance'; and 'near, the solid"
18983,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,mountains'--Wetherlam and Coniston Old Man--would shine 'bright as the
18984,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"clouds.' I think this is likely to have been the poet's track, because"
18985,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,he speaks of labourers going forth to till the fields; and the Yewdale
18986,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"valley is one that is (at its head) chiefly arable, so that he would"
18987,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,be likelier to have gazed on them there than in the vale of Hawkshead

18989,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,Yewdale as the one described as being a 'cultured vale'--obliged to
18990,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,remember that in Wordsworth's boyhood wheat was grown more extensively
18991,NOTE III.--THE HAWKSHEAD MORNING WALK: SUMMER VACATION,"than is now the case in these parts. Of course, the Furness Fell,"

19018,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"""We reached Cambridge at half-past nine. In our way to the Inn we"
19019,JOHN'S COLLEGE,stopped at the gate of St. John's College to set down one of our
19020,JOHN'S COLLEGE,passengers. The stopping of the carriage roused me from a sleepy
19021,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"musing, and I was awe-stricken with the solemnity of the old gateway,"
19022,JOHN'S COLLEGE,and the light from a great distance within streaming along the
19023,JOHN'S COLLEGE,pavement. When they told me it was the entrance to 'St. John's'
19024,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"College, I was still more affected by the gloomy yet beautiful sight"
19025,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"before me, for I thought of my dearest brother in his youthful days"
19026,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"passing through that gateway to his home, and I could have believed"
19027,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"that I saw him there even then, as I had seen him in the first year of"
19028,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"his residence. I met with Mr. Clarkson at the Inn, and was, you may"
19029,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"believe, rejoiced to hear his voice at the coach door. We supped"
19030,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"together, and immediately after supper I went to bed, and slept well,"
19031,JOHN'S COLLEGE,and at 8 o'clock next morning went to Trinity Chapel. There I stood
19032,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"for many minutes in silence before the statue of Newton, while the"
19033,JOHN'S COLLEGE,organ sounded. I never saw a statue that gave me one hundredth part so
19034,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"much pleasure--but pleasure, that is not the word, it is a sublime"
19035,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"sensation--in harmony with sentiments of devotion to the Divine Being,"
19036,JOHN'S COLLEGE,and reverence for the holy places where He is worshipped. We walked in
19037,JOHN'S COLLEGE,the groves all the morning and visited the Colleges. I sought out a
19038,JOHN'S COLLEGE,favourite ash tree which my brother speaks of in his poem on his own
19039,JOHN'S COLLEGE,life--a tree covered with ivy. We dined with a fellow of Peter-House
19040,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"in his rooms, and after dinner I went to King's College Chapel. There,"
19041,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"and everywhere else at Cambridge, I was even much more impressed with"
19042,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"the effect of the buildings than I had been formerly, and I do believe"
19043,JOHN'S COLLEGE,that this power of receiving an enlarged enjoyment from the sight of
19044,JOHN'S COLLEGE,buildings is one of the privileges of our later years. I have this
19045,JOHN'S COLLEGE,"moment received a letter from William...."""

19181,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",He would also have an extended view of copse and meadow land. He

19187,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""","It might be objected that the poem gives us the idea of a crag which,"

19189,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""","difficult ascent than this is, to justify the idea of difficulty as"

19194,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",
19195,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",but I do not think we need read more into the lines than that the boy
19196,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""","felt--as he scanned the country with his eyes, on the 'qui vive' at"

19199,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",
19200,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",And certainly the Pullwyke quarry crag rises most steeply from the

19206,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""","Hawkshead side of Outgate, or at the village itself, at the point of"
19207,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",convergence of the ways.
19208,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",
19209,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""","Secondly, the crag can hardly be described as rising from the"
19210,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",meeting-point of two highways; only one highway passes near it.
19211,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",
19212,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""","The crag is of so curious a formation geologically, that I can't fancy"

19215,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",
19216,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""","Then, again, the prospect is not sufficiently extended from it. The"

19218,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""","Blelham Tarn is not too far to have added to the watery sound, it is"

19221,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",
19222,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""","The present stone wall is not near the summit, and is of comparatively"

19226,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",But there are two other vantage grounds intermediate between those

19236,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",
19237,"NOTE V.--""THE MEETING-POINT OF TWO HIGHWAYS""",There can be no doubt that this is the crag 'par excellence' for a

19573,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"sometime between November 1791 and the spring of 1792, and that"
19574,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19575,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"'He perished fighting, _in supreme command_,"
19576,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"Upon the borders of the unhappy Loire,"
19577,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"For liberty, against deluded men,"
19578,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,His fellow-countrymen....'
19579,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19580,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,Though it seems very easy to identify a general even with such scanty
19581,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"data, the task is rendered more difficult by two inaccuracies in"
19582,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"Wordsworth's statement, which, however, can be explained and redressed"
19583,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,without much difficulty.
19584,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19585,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"The first inaccuracy is in the spelling of the name, which is"
19586,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,'Beaupuy' and not 'Beaupuis'--a slight mistake considering that
19587,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"Wordsworth was a foreigner, and, besides, wrote down his friend's name"
19588,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"ten years and perhaps more after losing sight of him. Moreover, the"
19589,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"name of the general who, I think, was meant by Wordsworth, I have"
19590,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"found spelt 'Beaupuy' in one instance, viz. the signature of a letter"
19591,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"of his, as printed in 'Vie et Correspondance de Merlin de Thionville',"
19592,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"publiée par Jean Reynaud, Paris, 1860 (2'e partie p. 241)."
19593,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19594,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"The spelling of proper names was not so fixed then as it is nowadays,"
19595,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,and this irregularity is not to be wondered at.
19596,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19597,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,The second inaccuracy consists in stating that General Beaupuy died on
19598,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"the banks of the Loire during the Vendean war. Indeed, he was"
19599,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"grievously wounded at the Battle of Château-Gonthier, on the 26th of"
19600,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"October 1793, and reported as dead. His soldiers thought he had been"
19601,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"killed, and the rumour must have spread abroad, as it was recorded by"
19602,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"A. Thiers himself in his 'Histoire de la Révolution', and by A."
19603,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,Challemel in his 'Histoire Musée de la République Française'.
19604,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19605,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"It is no wonder that Wordsworth, who was then in England, and could"
19606,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"only read imperfect accounts of what took place in France, should have"
19607,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,been mistaken too.
19608,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19609,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"No other General Beaupuy is recorded in the history of the Revolution,"
19610,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,so far as I have been able to ascertain. The moral character of the
19611,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"officer, whose life I shall relate, answers to Wordsworth's"
19612,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"description, and is worthy of his high estimate."
19613,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19614,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"Armand Michel de Bachelier, Chevalier de Beaupuy, was born at"
19615,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"Mussidan, in Perigord, on the 15th of July 1757. He belonged to a"
19616,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"noble family, less proud of its antiquity than of the blood it had"
19617,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,shed for France on many battlefields. On his mother's side (Mlle. de
19618,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"Villars), he reckoned Montaigne, the celebrated essayist, among his"
19619,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,ancestors. His parents having imbibed the philanthropic ideas of the
19620,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"time, educated him according to their principles."
19621,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19622,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"He had four brothers, who were all destined to turn republicans and do"
19623,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"good service to the new cause, though their interest certainly lay in"
19624,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,the opposite direction.

19626,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,...
19627,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19628,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,He was made sub-lieutenant in the regiment of Bassigny (33rd division
19629,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"of foot) on the 2nd of March 1773, and lieutenant of grenadiers on the"
19630,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,1st of October of the same year.
19631,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19632,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,In 1791 he was first lieutenant in the same regiment. Having sided
19633,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"with the Revolution, he was appointed commander of a battalion of"
19634,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,national volunteers in the department of Dordogne. I have not found
19635,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"the exact date of this appointment, but it must have taken place"
19636,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,immediately after his stay at Orléans with Wordsworth.
19637,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19638,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"I have found no further mention of his name till September 1792, when"
19639,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"he is known to have served in the ""Armée du Rhin,"" under General"

19644,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"when this place was besieged by the Prussians, and obliged to"
19645,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,capitulate after a long and famous siege (from 6th April 1793 to 22nd

19657,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"In the Vendean war, the ""Mayençais,"" or soldiers returned from"
19658,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"Mayence, made themselves conspicuous, and bore almost all the brunt of"
19659,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,the campaign. But none of them distinguished himself more than

19661,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19662,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,The Mayençais arrived in Vendée at the end of August or beginning of
19663,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"September 1793. To Beaupuy's skill the victory of Chollet (Oct. 17,"
19664,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,1793) is attributed by Jomini. In this battle he fought hand to hand
19665,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,with and overcame a Vendean cavalier. He himself had three horses
19666,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"killed, and had a very narrow escape. On the battlefield he was made"
19667,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"'general of division' by the ""Represéntants du peuple."" It was after"
19668,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,Chollet that the Vendeans made the memorable crossing of the Loire at
19669,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,St. Florent.
19670,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19671,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,At Laval and Château-Gonthier (Oct. 26) a terrible defeat was

19677,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"là, et portez à mes grenadiers ma chemise sanglante'."" His soldiers"
19678,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"thought he was dead, and then the error was spread, which was repeated"
19679,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"by Wordsworth, Thiers, and Challamel. Wordsworth's mistake is so far"
19680,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"interesting, as it seems to prove that very little or no"
19681,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,correspondence passed between the two friends after they had parted.
19682,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"Beaupuy, moreover, had too much work upon his hands to give much of"
19683,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,his time to letter-writing.
19684,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,
19685,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"Though severely wounded, Beaupuy lived on, and less than six weeks"
19686,NOTE VII.--GENERAL BEAUPUY,"after the battle of Château-Gonthier, he was seen on the ramparts of"
