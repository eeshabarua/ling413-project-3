85,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""Come, fill me flagons full and fair"
86,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"Of red wine and of white,"
87,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"And, maidens mine, my bower prepare--"
88,BRIDAL BALLAD.,It is my wedding night.
89,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
90,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""And braid my hair with jewels bright,"
91,BRIDAL BALLAD.,And make me fair and fine--
92,BRIDAL BALLAD.,This is the day that brings the night
93,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"When my desire is mine."""
94,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
95,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"They decked her bower with roses blown,"
96,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"With rushes strewed the floor,"
97,BRIDAL BALLAD.,And sewed more jewels on her gown
98,BRIDAL BALLAD.,Than ever she wore before.
99,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
100,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"She wore two roses in her face,"
101,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"Two jewels in her e'en,"
102,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"Her hair was crowned with sunset rays,"
103,BRIDAL BALLAD.,Her brows shone white between.
104,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
105,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""Tapers at the bed's foot,"" she saith,"
106,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""Two tapers at the head!"""
107,BRIDAL BALLAD.,It seemed more like the bed of death
108,BRIDAL BALLAD.,Than like a bridal bed.
109,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
110,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"He came; he took her hands in his,"
111,BRIDAL BALLAD.,He kissed her on the face;
112,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""There is more heaven in thy kiss"
113,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"Than in our Lady's grace""."
114,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
115,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"He kissed her once, he kissed her twice,"
116,BRIDAL BALLAD.,He kissed her three times o'er;
117,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"He kissed her brow, he kissed her eyes,"
118,BRIDAL BALLAD.,He kissed her mouth's red flower.
119,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
120,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""O Love, what is it ails thy knight?"
121,BRIDAL BALLAD.,I sicken and I pine;
122,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"Is it the red wine or the white,"
123,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"Or that sweet kiss of thine?"""
124,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
125,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""No kiss, no wine or white or red,"
126,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"Can make such sickness be,"
127,BRIDAL BALLAD.,Lie down and die on thy bride-bed
128,BRIDAL BALLAD.,For I have poisoned thee.
129,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
130,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""And though the curse of saints and men"
131,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"Upon me for it be,"
132,BRIDAL BALLAD.,I would it were to do again
133,BRIDAL BALLAD.,Since thou wert false to me.
134,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
135,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""Thou shouldst have loved or one or none,"
136,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"Nor she nor I loved twain,"
137,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"But we are twain thou hast undone,"

139,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
140,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""And when before my God I stand"

142,BRIDAL BALLAD.,I shall hold up this guilty hand
143,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"And He shall judge it clean."""
144,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
145,BRIDAL BALLAD.,He fell across the bridal bed
146,BRIDAL BALLAD.,Between the tapers pale:
147,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""I first shall see our God,"" he said,"
148,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""And I will tell thy tale."
149,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
150,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""And if God judge thee as I do,"
151,BRIDAL BALLAD.,Then art thou justified.
152,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"I loved thee and I was not true,"
153,BRIDAL BALLAD.,And that was why I died.
154,BRIDAL BALLAD.,
155,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"""If I could judge thee, thou shouldst be"
156,BRIDAL BALLAD.,First of the saints on high;
157,BRIDAL BALLAD.,"But ah, I fear God loveth thee"

164,THE GHOST.,
165,THE GHOST.,
166,THE GHOST.,"The year fades, as the west wind sighs,"
167,THE GHOST.,"And droops in many-coloured ways,"
168,THE GHOST.,But your soft presence never dies
169,THE GHOST.,From out the pathway of my days.
170,THE GHOST.,
171,THE GHOST.,"The spring is where you are, but still"
172,THE GHOST.,You from your heaven to me can bring
173,THE GHOST.,Sweet dreams and flowers enough to fill
174,THE GHOST.,A thousand empty worlds with Spring.
175,THE GHOST.,
176,THE GHOST.,I walk the wet and leafless woods;
177,THE GHOST.,Your shadow ever goes before
178,THE GHOST.,And paints the russet solitudes
179,THE GHOST.,With colours Summer never wore.
180,THE GHOST.,
181,THE GHOST.,I sit beside my lonely fire;
182,THE GHOST.,The ghostly twilight brings your face
183,THE GHOST.,And lights with memory and desire
184,THE GHOST.,My desolated dwelling-place.
185,THE GHOST.,
186,THE GHOST.,Among my books I feel your hand
187,THE GHOST.,"That turns the page just past my sight,"
188,THE GHOST.,Sometimes behind my chair you stand
189,THE GHOST.,And read the foolish rhymes I write.
190,THE GHOST.,
191,THE GHOST.,The old piano's keys I press
192,THE GHOST.,In random chords until I hear
193,THE GHOST.,"Your voice, your rustling silken dress,"
194,THE GHOST.,And smell the violets that you wear.
195,THE GHOST.,
196,THE GHOST.,"I do not weep now any more,"
197,THE GHOST.,I think I hardly even sigh;
198,THE GHOST.,I would not have you think I bore
199,THE GHOST.,The kind of wound of which men die.
200,THE GHOST.,
201,THE GHOST.,Believe that smooth content has grown
202,THE GHOST.,Over the ghastly grave of pain--
203,THE GHOST.,"""Content!"" ... O lips, that were my own,"
204,THE GHOST.,That I shall never kiss again!

212,THE MODERN JUDAS.,For what wilt thou sell thy Lord?
213,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"""For certain pieces of silver, since wealth buys the world's"
214,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"good word."""
215,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"But the world's word, how canst thou hear it, while thy brothers"
216,THE MODERN JUDAS.,cry scorn on thy name?
217,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"And how shall thy bargain content thee, when thy brothers shall"
218,THE MODERN JUDAS.,clothe thee with shame?
219,THE MODERN JUDAS.,
220,THE MODERN JUDAS.,For what shall thy brother be sold?
221,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"""For the rosy garland of pleasure, and the coveted crown of gold."""
222,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"But thy soul will turn them to thorns, and to heaviness binding"
223,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"thy head,"
224,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"While women are dying of shame, and children are crying for bread."
225,THE MODERN JUDAS.,
226,THE MODERN JUDAS.,For what wilt thou sell thy soul?
227,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"""For the world."" And what shall it profit, when thou shalt have"
228,THE MODERN JUDAS.,gained the whole?
229,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"What profit the things thou hast, if the thing thou art be so mean?"
230,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"Wilt thou fill, with the husks of having, the void of the"
231,THE MODERN JUDAS.,might-have-been?
232,THE MODERN JUDAS.,
233,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"""But, when my soul shall be gone,"
234,THE MODERN JUDAS.,No more shall I fail to profit by all the deeds I have done!
235,THE MODERN JUDAS.,And wealth and the world and pleasure shall sing sweet songs
236,THE MODERN JUDAS.,in my ear
237,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"When the stupid soul is silenced, which never would let me hear."
238,THE MODERN JUDAS.,
239,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"""And if a void there should be"

243,THE MODERN JUDAS.,again.
244,THE MODERN JUDAS.,
245,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"""But I shall have pleasure and praise!"""
246,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"Praise shall not pleasure thee then, nor pleasure laugh in thy"
247,THE MODERN JUDAS.,days:
248,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"For as colour is not, without light, so happiness is not, without"
249,THE MODERN JUDAS.,"Thy Brother, the Lord whom thou soldest--and the soul that thou hast"
250,THE MODERN JUDAS.,cast out!

265,THE SOUL TO THE IDEAL.,I will not go away! Away
266,THE SOUL TO THE IDEAL.,From reeds and pool why should I go

268,THE SOUL TO THE IDEAL.,Here sleeps cool twilight all the day;
269,THE SOUL TO THE IDEAL.,"Do I not love thy tune? No, no!"
270,THE SOUL TO THE IDEAL.,I will not say!
271,THE SOUL TO THE IDEAL.,
272,THE SOUL TO THE IDEAL.,I will not say I love thy tune;

293,A DEATH-BED.,
294,A DEATH-BED.,"It is too late, too late!"
295,A DEATH-BED.,"The wine is spilled, the altar violate;"
296,A DEATH-BED.,Now all the foolish virtues of the past--
297,A DEATH-BED.,"Its joys that could not last,"
298,A DEATH-BED.,"Its flowers that had to fade,"
299,A DEATH-BED.,"Its bliss so long delayed,"
300,A DEATH-BED.,"Its sun so soon o'ercast,"
301,A DEATH-BED.,"Its faith so soon betrayed,"

310,A DEATH-BED.,"How all good things were butchered, one by one."
311,A DEATH-BED.,"Not one of these but life has fouled its name,"
312,A DEATH-BED.,Blotted it out with sin and loss and shame--
313,A DEATH-BED.,Until my whole life's striving is made vain.

315,A DEATH-BED.,My house is left unto me desolate.

317,A DEATH-BED.,"Yet what if here,"

319,A DEATH-BED.,"Through the last bitterness of the last vain tear,"
320,A DEATH-BED.,One saw a face--
321,A DEATH-BED.,Human--not turned away from man's disgrace--
322,A DEATH-BED.,A face divinely dear--
323,A DEATH-BED.,A head that had a crown of thorns to wear;
324,A DEATH-BED.,If there should come a hand
325,A DEATH-BED.,Drawing this tired head to a place of rest
326,A DEATH-BED.,On a most loving breast;
327,A DEATH-BED.,And as one felt that one could almost bear
328,A DEATH-BED.,To tell the whole long sickening trivial tale
329,A DEATH-BED.,Of how one came so utterly to fail
330,A DEATH-BED.,Of all one once knew that one might attain--
331,A DEATH-BED.,"If one should feel consoling arms about,"

349,I.,
350,I.,"Though strong be the devil's net,"
351,I.,"Thy grace, O God, is more strong;"

353,I.,To even the edge of wrong.
354,I.,
355,I.,"The world never fired my brain,"
356,I.,The flesh never moved my heart--
357,I.,"Thou hast spared me the strife and strain,"
358,I.,The struggle and sorrow and smart.
359,I.,
360,I.,"The dreams that never were deeds,"
361,I.,"The thought that shines not in word,"
362,I.,The struggle that never succeeds--
363,I.,"Thou hast saved me from these, O Lord!"
364,I.,
365,I.,I stood in my humble place
366,I.,While those who aimed high fell low;

378,I.,In His own wise wonderful way.
379,I.,
380,I.,"Oh the infinite marvels of grace,"

405,II.,My soul through depths where all its guilt showed plainly
406,II.,Into the chaos of despair was tossed.
407,II.,
408,II.,Yet not despair. I see far off a splendour;
409,II.,Here from my hell I see a heaven on high
410,II.,For those brave men whom earth could never render
411,II.,Cowards as foul and beasts as base as I!
412,II.,
413,II.,"Hell is not hell lit by such consolation,"
414,II.,Heaven were not heaven that lacked a thought like this--
415,II.,"That, though my soul may never see salvation,"
416,II.,God yet saves all these other souls of His!

418,II.,"The waves of death come faster, faster, faster;"

422,II.,
423,II.,And God be praised that other men are wearing
424,II.,"The white, white flower I trampled as I trod;"
425,II.,"That all fail not, that all are not despairing,"
426,II.,"That all are not as I, I thank Thee, God!"

444,AT THE PRISON GATE.,
445,AT THE PRISON GATE.,Despair sat shrined in her dry eyes--
446,AT THE PRISON GATE.,"Her heart, I thought, in blood must weep"
447,AT THE PRISON GATE.,For hopes that never more can rise
448,AT THE PRISON GATE.,From their death-sleep;
449,AT THE PRISON GATE.,And round her hovered phantoms gray--
450,AT THE PRISON GATE.,Ghosts of delight dead many a day;
451,AT THE PRISON GATE.,And all the thorns of life seemed wed
452,AT THE PRISON GATE.,In one sharp crown about her head.
453,AT THE PRISON GATE.,
454,AT THE PRISON GATE.,And all the poor world's aching heart
455,AT THE PRISON GATE.,"Beat there, I thought, and could not break."
456,AT THE PRISON GATE.,Oh! to be strong to bear the smart--
457,AT THE PRISON GATE.,The vast heart-ache!

471,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,usury and the pillage of the poor--and of what chanced
472,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,thereafter.

480,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Brave churches grew 'neath hands of men:
481,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,We see not now their like again.
482,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
483,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,We built it on the green hill-side
484,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"That leans its bosom o'er the town,"
485,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"So that its presence, sanctified,"
486,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Might ever on our lives look down.
487,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"We built; and those who built not, they"
488,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Brought us their blessing day by day,"
489,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And lingered to rejoice and pray.
490,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
491,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"For years the masons toiled, for years"
492,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The craftsmen wrought till they had made
493,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,A church we scarce could see for tears--
494,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Its fairness made our love afraid.
495,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Its clear-cut cream-white tracery
496,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Stood out against the deep bright sky
497,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Like good deeds 'gainst eternity.
498,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
499,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,In the deep roof each separate beam
500,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Had its own garland--ivy, vine,--"
501,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Giving to man the carver's dream,"
502,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,In sight of men a certain sign--
503,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And all day long the workers plied.
504,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"""The church shall finished be,"" we cried,"
505,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"""And consecrate by Easter-tide."""
506,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
507,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Our church! It was so fair, so dear,"
508,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,So fit a church to praise God in!
509,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"It had such show of carven gear,"
510,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Such chiselled work, without, within!"
511,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Such marble for the steps and floor,"
512,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Such window-jewels and such store
513,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Of gold and gems the altar bore!
514,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
515,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Each stone by loving hands was hewn,"
516,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,By loving hands each beam was sawn;
517,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The hammers made a merry tune
518,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,In winter dusk and summer dawn.
519,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Love built the house, but gold had paid"
520,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,For that wherewith the house was made.
521,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"""Would love had given all!"" we said."
522,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
523,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"But poor in all save love were we,"
524,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And he was poor in all save gold
525,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Who gave the gold. By usury
526,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Were gained his riches manifold.
527,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"We knew that? If we knew, we thought"
528,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"'Tis good if men do good in aught,"
529,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And by good works may heaven be bought!
530,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
531,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,At last the echo died in air
532,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Of the last stroke. The silence then
533,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Passed in to fill the church, left bare"
534,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Of the loving voice of Christian men.
535,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The silence saddened all the sun,"
536,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,So gladly was our work begun.
537,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Now all that happy work was done.
538,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
539,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Did any voices in the night
540,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Call through those arches? Were there wings
541,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,That swept between the pillars white--
542,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Wide pinions of unvisioned things?
543,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The priests who watched the relics heard
544,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Wing-whispers--not of bat or bird--
545,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And moan of inarticulate word.
546,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
547,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Then sunlight, morning, and sweet air"
548,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Adorned our church, and there were borne"
549,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Great sheaves of boughs of blossoms fair
550,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,To grace the consecration morn.
551,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Then round our church trooped knight and dame;
552,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Within, alone, the bishop came,"
553,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And the twelve candles leaped to flame.
554,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
555,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Then round our church the bishop went
556,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,With all his priests--a brave array.
557,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,There was no sign nor portent sent
558,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"As, glad at heart, he went his way,"
559,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Sprinkling the holy water round
560,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Three times on walls and crowd and ground
561,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Within the churchyard's sacred bound.
562,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
563,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Then--but ye know the function's scope
564,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,At consecration--all the show
565,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Of torch and incense, stole and cope;"
566,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And how the acolytes do go
567,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Before the bishop--how they bear
568,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The lighted tapers, flaming fair,"
569,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Blown back by the sweet wavering air.
570,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
571,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The bishop, knocking at the door,"
572,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The deacon answering from within,"
573,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"""Lift up your heads, ye gates, be sure"
574,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The King of Glory shall come in""--"
575,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The bishop passed in with the choir.
576,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Thank God for this--our soul's desire,"
577,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Our altar, meet for heaven's fire!"
578,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
579,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The bishop, kneeling in his place"
580,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Where our bright windows made day dim,"
581,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"With all heaven's glory in his face,"
582,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Began the consecration hymn:
583,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"""_Veni_,"" he sang, in clear strong tone."
584,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Then--on the instant--song was done,"
585,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Its very echo scattered--gone!
586,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
587,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"For, as the bishop's voice rang clear,"
588,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Another voice rang clearer still--
589,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,A voice wherein the soul could hear
590,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The discord of unmeasured ill--
591,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And sudden breathless silence fell
592,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,On all the church. And I wot well
593,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,There are such silences in hell.
594,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
595,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Taper and torch died down--went out--
596,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"And all our church grew dark and cold,"
597,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"And deathly odours crept about,"
598,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"And chill, as of the churchyard mould;"
599,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"And every flower drooped its head,"
600,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"And all the rose's leaves were shed,"
601,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And all the lilies dropped down dead.
602,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
603,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"There, in the bishop's chair, we saw--"
604,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,How can I tell you? Memories shrink
605,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,To mix anew the cup of awe
606,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,We shuddering mortals had to drink.
607,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,What was it? There! The shape that stood
608,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Before the altar and the rood--
609,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,It was not human flesh and blood!
610,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
611,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"A light more bright than any sun,"
612,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"A shade more dark than any night,"
613,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"A shape that human shape was none,"
614,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"A cloud, a sense of wingëd might,"
615,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"And, like an infernal trumpet sound,"
616,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Rang through the church's hush profound
617,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,A voice. We listened horror-bound.
618,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
619,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"""_Venio!_ Cease, cease to consecrate!"
620,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Love built the church, but it is mine!"
621,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"'Tis built of stone hewn out by hate,"
622,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Cemented by man's blood divine.
623,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Whence came the gold that paid for this?
624,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"From pillage of the poor, I wis--"
625,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"That gold was mine, and mine this is!"
626,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
627,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"""Your King has cursed the usurer's gold,"
628,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,He gives it to me for my fee!
629,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Your church is builded, but behold"
630,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Your church is fair for me--for me!
631,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Who robs the poor to me is given;
632,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Impenitent and unforgiven,"
633,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"His church is built for hell, not heaven!"""
634,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
635,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Then, as we gazed, the face grew clear,"
636,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And all men stood as turned to stone;
637,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Each man beheld through dews of fear
638,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,A face--his own--yet not his own;
639,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"His own face, darkened, lost, debased,"
640,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"With hell's own signet stamped and traced,"
641,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And all the God in it effaced.
642,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
643,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"A crash like thunder shook the walls,"
644,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,A flame like lightning shot them through:
645,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"""Fly, fly before the judgment falls,"
646,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"And all the stones be fallen on you!"""
647,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And as we fled we saw bright gleams
648,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Of fire leap out 'mid joists and beams.
649,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Our church! Oh, love--oh, hopes--oh, dreams!"
650,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
651,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,We stood without--a pallid throng--
652,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"And as the flame leaped high and higher,"
653,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Shrill winds we heard that rushed along
654,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And fanned the transports of the fire.
655,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The sky grew black; against the sky
656,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The blue and scarlet flames leaped high,"
657,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And cries as of lost souls wailed by.
658,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
659,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The church in glowing vesture stood,"
660,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The lead ran down as it were wax,"
661,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The great stones cracked and burned like wood,"
662,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The wood caught fire and flamed like flax:
663,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"A horrid chequered light and shade,"
664,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"By smoke and flame alternate made,"
665,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Upon men's upturned faces played.
666,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
667,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Down crashed the walls. Our lovely spire--
668,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,A blackened ruin--fell and lay.
669,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The very earth about caught fire,"
670,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,And flame-tongues licked along the clay.
671,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The fire did neither stay nor spare
672,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Till the foundations were laid bare
673,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"To the hot, sickened, smoke-filled air."
674,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
675,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"There in the sight of men it lay,"
676,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Our church that we had made so fair!
677,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"A heap of ashes white and gray,"
678,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,With sparks still gleaming here and there.
679,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The sun came out again, and shone"
680,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,On all our loving work undone--
681,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Our church destroyed, our labour gone!"
682,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,
683,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"Gone? Is it gone? God knows it, no!"
684,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The hands that builded built aright:
685,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"The men who loved and laboured so,"
686,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Their church is built in heaven's height!
687,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,"In every stone a glittering gem,"
688,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,Gold in the gold Jerusalem--
689,THE DEVIL'S DUE.,The church their love built waits for them.

694,LOVE IN JUNE.,LOVE IN JUNE.
695,LOVE IN JUNE.,
696,LOVE IN JUNE.,
697,LOVE IN JUNE.,Through the glowing meadows aflame
698,LOVE IN JUNE.,With buttercup gold I came
699,LOVE IN JUNE.,"To the green, still heart of the wood."
700,LOVE IN JUNE.,"A wood-pigeon cooed and cooed,"
701,LOVE IN JUNE.,"The hazel-stems grew close,"
702,LOVE IN JUNE.,"Like leaves round the heart of a rose,"
703,LOVE IN JUNE.,"Round the still, green nest that I chose."
704,LOVE IN JUNE.,
705,LOVE IN JUNE.,Then I gathered the bracken that grew
706,LOVE IN JUNE.,"In a fairy forest all round,"
707,LOVE IN JUNE.,And I laid it in heaps on the ground
708,LOVE IN JUNE.,With grass and blossoms and leaves.
709,LOVE IN JUNE.,"I gathered the summer in sheaves,"
710,LOVE IN JUNE.,"And pale, rare roses a few,"
711,LOVE IN JUNE.,And spread out a carpet meet
712,LOVE IN JUNE.,For the touch of my lady's feet.
713,LOVE IN JUNE.,
714,LOVE IN JUNE.,I waited; the wood was still;
715,LOVE IN JUNE.,Only one little brown bird
716,LOVE IN JUNE.,On a hazel swayed and stirred
717,LOVE IN JUNE.,With the impulse of his song;
718,LOVE IN JUNE.,"And I waited, and time was long."
719,LOVE IN JUNE.,
720,LOVE IN JUNE.,Then I heard a step on the grass
721,LOVE IN JUNE.,"In the path where the others pass,"
722,LOVE IN JUNE.,And a voice like a voice in a dream;
723,LOVE IN JUNE.,"And I saw a glory, a gleam,"
724,LOVE IN JUNE.,A flash of white through the green
725,LOVE IN JUNE.,(Her arms and her gown are white);
726,LOVE IN JUNE.,And the summer sighed her name
727,LOVE IN JUNE.,As she and the sunshine came:
728,LOVE IN JUNE.,O sun and blue sky and delight!
729,LOVE IN JUNE.,O eyes and lips of my queen!
730,LOVE IN JUNE.,
731,LOVE IN JUNE.,What was done there or said
732,LOVE IN JUNE.,"No one will ever know,"
733,LOVE IN JUNE.,For nobody saw or heard
734,LOVE IN JUNE.,"Save one little, brown, bright bird"
735,LOVE IN JUNE.,"Who swayed on a twig overhead,"
736,LOVE IN JUNE.,And he will never betray;
737,LOVE IN JUNE.,"But all who pass by that way,"
738,LOVE IN JUNE.,As they near the spot where we lay
739,LOVE IN JUNE.,Among the blossoms and grass
740,LOVE IN JUNE.,Where the leaves and the ferns lay thick
741,LOVE IN JUNE.,"(Though it lies out of reach, out of sight"
742,LOVE IN JUNE.,"Of the path where the world may pass),"
743,LOVE IN JUNE.,Feel their heart and their pulse beat quick
744,LOVE IN JUNE.,"In a measure that rhymes with the leaves and flowers,"
745,LOVE IN JUNE.,"That rhymes with the summer and sun,"
746,LOVE IN JUNE.,"With the lover to win or won,"
747,LOVE IN JUNE.,"With the wild-flower crown of delight,"
748,LOVE IN JUNE.,The crown of love that was ours.

756,THE GARDEN.,"My garden was lovely to see,"
757,THE GARDEN.,"For all things fair,"
758,THE GARDEN.,"Sweet flowers and blossoms rare,"
759,THE GARDEN.,I had planted there.
760,THE GARDEN.,"There were pinks and lilies and stocks,"
761,THE GARDEN.,"Sweet gray and white stocks, and rose and rue,"
762,THE GARDEN.,"And clematis white and blue,"
763,THE GARDEN.,And pansies and daisies and phlox.
764,THE GARDEN.,"And the lawn was trim, and the trees were shady,"
765,THE GARDEN.,And all things were ready to greet my lady
766,THE GARDEN.,On the Life's-love-crowning day
767,THE GARDEN.,When she should come
768,THE GARDEN.,"To her lover's home,"
769,THE GARDEN.,To give herself to me.
770,THE GARDEN.,
771,THE GARDEN.,I saw the red of the roses--
772,THE GARDEN.,The royal roses that bloomed for her sake.
773,THE GARDEN.,"""They shall lie,"" I said, ""where my heart's hopes lie:"
774,THE GARDEN.,"They shall droop on her heart and die."""
775,THE GARDEN.,I dreamed in the orchard-closes:
776,THE GARDEN.,"""'Tis here we will walk in the July days,"
777,THE GARDEN.,When the paths and the lawn are ablaze;
778,THE GARDEN.,"We will walk here, and look at our life's great bliss:"
779,THE GARDEN.,"And thank God for this""."
780,THE GARDEN.,
781,THE GARDEN.,I leaned where the jasmine white
782,THE GARDEN.,Wreathed all my window round:
783,THE GARDEN.,"""Here we will lean,"
784,THE GARDEN.,"I and my queen,"
785,THE GARDEN.,And look out on the broad moonlight.
786,THE GARDEN.,For there shall be moonlight--bright--
787,THE GARDEN.,"On my wedding-night."""
788,THE GARDEN.,
789,THE GARDEN.,She never saw the flowers
790,THE GARDEN.,That were hers from their first sweet hours.
791,THE GARDEN.,"The roses, the pinks, and the dark heartsease"
792,THE GARDEN.,"Died in my garden, ungathered, forlorn."
793,THE GARDEN.,"Only the jasmine, the lilies, the white, white rose,"
794,THE GARDEN.,They were gathered--to honour and sorrow born.
795,THE GARDEN.,"They lay round her, touched her close."
796,THE GARDEN.,"The jasmine stars--white stars, that about our window their faint"
797,THE GARDEN.,"light shed,"
798,THE GARDEN.,Lay round her head.
799,THE GARDEN.,"And the white, white roses lay on her breast,"
800,THE GARDEN.,"And a long, white lily lay in her hand."
801,THE GARDEN.,
802,THE GARDEN.,They lie by her--rest with her rest;
803,THE GARDEN.,"But I, unhonoured, unblest--"
804,THE GARDEN.,"I stand outside,"
805,THE GARDEN.,In the ruined garden solitude--
806,THE GARDEN.,Where she never stood--
807,THE GARDEN.,On the trim green sod
808,THE GARDEN.,Which she never trod;
809,THE GARDEN.,"And the red, red roses grow and blow,--"
810,THE GARDEN.,As if any one cared
811,THE GARDEN.,How they fared!
812,THE GARDEN.,And the gate of Eden is shut; and I stand
813,THE GARDEN.,And see the Angel with flaming sword--
814,THE GARDEN.,Life's pitiless Lord--
815,THE GARDEN.,And I know I never may pass.
816,THE GARDEN.,Alas! alas!
817,THE GARDEN.,O Rose! my rose!

2217,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2218,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"""We come to crave the counsel of Apollo--"
2219,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,The men of Cymé he has counselled often--
2220,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Ask of the god an answer to our question,"
2221,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,Ask of Apollo here in Branch[)i]dæ.
2222,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2223,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"""Pactyes the Lydian, flying from the Persian,"

2226,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"What does Apollo bid his servants do?"""
2227,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2228,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,The Oracle replied--and straight returning
2229,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"To Cymé ran the messengers fleet-footed,"
2230,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,Brought to the citizens the Sun-god's answer:
2231,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"""Apollo bids you yield to Persia's will""."
2232,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2233,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"So when the men of Cymé heard the answer,"
2234,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"They set in hand at once to yield their suppliant,"
2235,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"But Aristodicus, loved of the city,"
2236,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Withstood their will,--and thus to them spake he."
2237,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2238,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"""Your messengers have lied--they have made merry"
2239,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"In their own homes, they have not sought Apollo;"
2240,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,The god in Branch[)i]dæ had never counselled
2241,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,That we should yield our suppliant to the foe.
2242,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2243,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"""Wait. I, myself, with others of your choosing,"
2244,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Will seek the god, and bring you back his answer,"
2245,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,_I_ would not yield the man who trusted Cymé--
2246,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"What--is the god of baser stuff than I?"""
2247,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2248,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"So, by the bright bay, under the blue heavens,"

2250,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,A second time beneath the purple shadows
2251,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,Passed through the laurels to Apollo's fane.
2252,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2253,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Then Aristodicus spake thus: ""To Cymé"
2254,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,Comes Pactyes fleeing from the wrath of Persia--
2255,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"And she demands him, but we dare not yield him,"
2256,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,Until we know what thou wouldst have us do.

2262,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2263,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,So the Cyméan spake. Apollo answered:
2264,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"""Yield ye your suppliant--yield him to the Persians""."
2265,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Then Aristodicus bethought him further,"
2266,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,And in this fashion craftily he wrought.
2267,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2268,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"All round the temple, in the nooks and crannies"
2269,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Of carven work made by man's love and labour,"
2270,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"In perfect safety, by Apollo guarded,"
2271,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,The swallows and the sparrows built their nests.
2272,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2273,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,And all day long their floating wings made beauty
2274,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"About the temple and the whispering laurels,"
2275,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"And their shrill notes, with the sea's ceaseless murmur,"
2276,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,Rose in sweet chorus to the great god's ears.
2277,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2278,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Now round the temple went the men of Cymé,"
2279,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Tore down the nests and snared the building swallows,"
2280,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,And a wild wind went moaning through the branches.
2281,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"The sunlight died, and all the sky grew gray."
2282,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2283,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Men shivered in the disenchanted noontide,"
2284,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"And overhead the gray sky darkened, darkened,"
2285,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"And, in the heart of every man beholding,"
2286,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,The anger of the immortal gods made night.
2287,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2288,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,Then from the hid shrine of the inner temple
2289,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Came forth a voice more beautiful than music,"
2290,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"More terrible than thunder and wild waters,"
2291,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,And more to be desired than summer sun.
2292,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2293,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"""O thou most impious of all impious mortals,"
2294,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Why hast thou dared defy me in my temple,"
2295,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"And torn away the homes of those who trust me,"
2296,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Taken my suppliants from me for thy prey?"""
2297,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2298,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Then Aristodicus stood forth, and answered:"
2299,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"""Lord, is it thus _thy_ suppliants are succoured,"
2300,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,What time thy Oracle bids men of Cymé
2301,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"To yield their suppliant to the Persian spears?"""
2302,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,
2303,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,Then on the hush of awful expectation
2304,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Following the challenge of the too-bold mortals,"
2305,APOLLO AND THE MEN OF CYMÉ.,"Broke the god's voice, unspeakably melodious"

2587,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,
2588,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"He looked out to the pearly east,"
2589,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,Ere day began to break:
2590,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"""God save my boy till evensong,"""
2591,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"He said, ""for Mary's sake!"""
2592,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,
2593,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,He looked out on the western sky

2598,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"And morn and eve, and noon and night,"
2599,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,His heart one prayer did make:

2608,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"""A word, Sir Hugh, a word with you,"

2622,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,
2623,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,He saw the little arms held out;

2633,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"""If I should open and let thee in,"

2642,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,
2643,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"The boy looked up, his shoulders squared,"
2644,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,Threw back his bright blond hair:

2657,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,
2658,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"""What? I must yield my castle up,"

2660,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,I trow ye never had to do
2661,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,Till now with honest men!
2662,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,
2663,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"""'Tis but by traitors such as you"
2664,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,That such foul deeds be done;
2665,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,Not to betray his king and cause
2666,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,Did I beget my son!
2667,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,
2668,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"""My son was bred to wield the sword"

2676,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"Here--take his father's knife!"""
2677,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,
2678,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,With that he flung the long knife down
2679,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"From off the castle wall,"

2683,THE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.,"Sir Hugh passed down the turret stair,"

3000,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"And where the altar stood, and where the Christ"

3002,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Law-tables, as if love had not sufficed"
3003,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,To all the world has ever known of good!
3004,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Our Lady's chapel was a lightless shrine;

3011,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,The lovely sunset's gracious rosy smile.
3012,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"A vault, a tomb wherein was laid to sleep"

3014,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,If only for an instant's breathing while!
3015,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3016,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Cold with my rage against the men who held
3017,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"At such cheap rate the labours of the dead,"

3026,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,What my walls were once worth
3027,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"When men worked for love, not for gold?"
3028,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Each stone was made to hold
3029,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,A heartful of love and faith;

3037,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Passion of trust and of prayer!
3038,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Ah! the old days were fair,"
3039,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Love on the earth was then,"
3040,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Strong were men's souls, and brave:"

3047,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Tears fell down at their feet,"
3048,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Hearts with the Christ-heart beat,"
3049,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Hands in men's hands held fast;
3050,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Union and brotherhood were!

3053,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3054,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"""Then, when later there came"
3055,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Hatred, anger and strife,"
3056,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,The sword blood-red and the flame
3057,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"And the stake and contempt of life,"
3058,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Husband severed from wife,"
3059,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Hearts with the Christ-heart bled:

3070,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"They tore down and trampled the rood,"
3071,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Stained my pillars with blood,"

3074,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"""Yet, when my walls were left"
3075,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Robbed of all beauty and bare,"
3076,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Still God cancelled the theft,"
3077,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,The soul of the thing was there.
3078,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"In my damp, unwindowed air"
3079,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Fugitives stopped to pray,"
3080,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"And their prayers were splendid to hear,"
3081,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Like the sound of a storm that is near--
3082,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,And love was not dead that day.
3083,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3084,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"""Then the birds of the air built nests"
3085,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"In these empty shadows of mine,"
3086,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,And the warmth of their brooding breasts
3087,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Still warmed the untended shrine.
3088,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,His creatures are all divine;
3089,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"He is praised by the woodland throng,"
3090,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,And my old walls echoed and heard
3091,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"The passionate praising word,"
3092,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,And love still lived in their song.
3093,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3094,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"""Then came the Protestant crew"
3095,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,And made me the thing you have known--
3096,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Whitewashed and plastered me new,"
3097,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Covered my marble and stone--
3098,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Could they not leave me alone?
3099,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Vain was the cry, for they trod"
3100,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Over my tombs, and I saw"
3101,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Books and the Tables of Law
3102,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Set in the place of my God.
3103,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3104,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"""And love is dead, so it seems!"
3105,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Shall I never hear again
3106,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"The music of heaven and of dreams,"
3107,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Songs of ideals of men?
3108,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Great dreams and songs we had then,"
3109,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Now I but hear from the wood
3110,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Cry of a bat or a bird.
3111,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Oh for love's passionate word
3112,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Sent from men's hearts to the Good!
3113,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3114,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"""Sometimes men come, and they sing,"
3115,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,But I know not their song nor their voice;
3116,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"They have no hearts they can bring,"
3117,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"They have no souls to rejoice,"
3118,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Theirs is but folly and noise.
3119,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Oh for a voice that could sing

3123,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3124,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,The church was full of silence. I shut in
3125,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Its loss and loneliness, and went my way."
3126,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Its sadness was not less its walls within
3127,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Because I wore it in my heart that day,"
3128,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"And many a day since, when I see again"
3129,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Marsh sunsets, and across the golden plain"

3135,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"And through wet woods, all dripping, brown and sere,"
3136,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,I came one day towards the church again.
3137,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,It was the spring-time of the day and year;
3138,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,The sky was light and bright and flecked with cloud
3139,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"That, wind-swept, changeful, through bright rents allowed"
3140,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Sun and blue sky to smile and disappear.
3141,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3142,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,The sky behind the old gray church was gray--
3143,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Gray as my memories, and gray as I;"
3144,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,The forlorn graves each side the grassy way
3145,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Called to me ""Brother!"" as I passed them by."
3146,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"The door was open. ""I shall feel again,"""
3147,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"I thought, ""that inextinguishable pain"
3148,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Of longing loss and hopeless memory."""
3149,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3150,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,When--O electric flash of ecstasy!
3151,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,No spirit's moan of pain fell on my ear--
3152,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"A human voice, an angel's melody,"
3153,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,God let me in that perfect moment hear.
3154,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Oh, the sweet rush of gladness and delight,"
3155,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Of human striving to the heavenly light,"
3156,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"Of great ideals, permanent and dear!"
3157,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3158,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"All the old dreams linked with the newer faith,"
3159,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"All the old faith with higher dreams enwound,"
3160,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,Surged through the very heart of loss and death
3161,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,In passionate waves of pure and perfect sound.
3162,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"The past came back: the Christ, the Mother-maid,"
3163,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"The incense of the hearts that praised and prayed,"
3164,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"The past's peace, and the future's faith profound."

3179,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"One that had heard and that had understood,"
3180,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"As I had done, the church's desolate moan,"

3182,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,And never willed to do and never could.
3183,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,
3184,RUCKINGE CHURCH.,"I left the church, glad to the soul and strong,"
