276,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._
277,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,
278,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,It was but some few nights ago
279,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,I wandered down this quiet lane;
280,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,I pray that I may never know
281,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"The feelings then I felt, again."
282,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"The leaves were shining all about,"
283,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,You might almost have seen them springing;
284,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"I heard the cuckoo’s simple shout,"
285,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,And all the little birds were singing.
286,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"It was not dull, the air was clear,"
287,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"All lovely sights and sounds to deal,"
288,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"My eyes could see, my ears could hear,"
289,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"Only my heart, it would not feel;"
290,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"And yet that it should not be so,"
291,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,My mind kept telling me within;
292,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"Though nought was wrong that I did know,"
293,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,I thought I must have done some sin.
294,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"For I am sure as I can be,"
295,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,That they who have been wont to look
296,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"On all in Nature’s face they see,"
297,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,Even as in the Holy Book;
298,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,They who with pure and humble eyes
299,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"Have gazed and read her lessons high,"
300,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,And taught their spirits to be wise
301,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"In love and human sympathy,—"
302,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,That they can soon and surely tell
303,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"When aught has gone amiss within,"
304,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"When the mind is not sound and well,"
305,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,Nor the soul free from taint of sin.
306,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"For as God’s Spirit from above,"
307,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"So Beauty is to them below,"
308,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"And when they slight that holy love,"
309,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,Their hearts that presence may not know.
310,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"So I turned home the way I came,"
311,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"With downcast looks and heavy heart,"
312,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"A guilty thing and full of shame,"
313,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,With a dull grief that had no smart.
314,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,It chanced when I was nearly there
315,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,That all at once I raised my eyes—
316,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"Was it a dream, or vision rare,"
317,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,That then they saw before them rise?
318,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"I see it now, before me here,"
319,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"As often, often I have done,"
320,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"As bright as it could then appear,"
321,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,All shining in the setting sun.
322,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"Elms, with their mantling foliage spread,"
323,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"And tall dark poplars rising out,"
324,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"And blossomed orchards, white and red,"
325,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"Cast, like a long low fence, about;"
326,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"And in the midst the grey church-tower,"
327,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"With one slight turret at its side,"
328,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,Bringing to mind with silent power
329,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,Those thousand homes the elm-trees hide.
330,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,And then there came the thought of one
331,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"Who on his bed of sickness lay,"
332,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,Whilst I beneath the setting sun
333,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,Was dreaming this sweet hour away.
334,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"I thought of hearts for him that beat,"
335,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,Of aching eyes their watch that kept;
336,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,The sister’s and the mother’s seat—
337,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,And oh! I thought I should have wept.
338,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"And oh! my spirit melted then,"
339,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"The weight fell off me that I bore,"
340,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,And now I felt in truth again
341,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,The lovely things that stood before.
342,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"O blessed, blessed scene, to thee,"
343,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"For that thy sweet and softening power,"
344,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"I could have fallen upon my knee,"
345,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"Thy stately elms, thy grey church-tower."
346,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"So then I took my homeward way,"
347,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"My heart in sweet and holy frame,"
348,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,"With spirit, I may dare to say,"
349,_AN EVENING WALK IN SPRING._,More good and soft than when I came.

355,_AN INCIDENT._,
356,_AN INCIDENT._,’Twas on a sunny summer day
357,_AN INCIDENT._,"I trod a mighty city’s street,"
358,_AN INCIDENT._,And when I started on my way
359,_AN INCIDENT._,My heart was full of fancies sweet;
360,_AN INCIDENT._,"But soon, as nothing could be seen,"
361,_AN INCIDENT._,"But countenances sharp and keen,"
362,_AN INCIDENT._,Nought heard or seen around but told
363,_AN INCIDENT._,"Of something bought or something sold,"
364,_AN INCIDENT._,And none that seemed to think or care
365,_AN INCIDENT._,"That any save himself was there,—"
366,_AN INCIDENT._,
367,_AN INCIDENT._,Full soon my heart began to sink
368,_AN INCIDENT._,"With a strange shame and inward pain,"
369,_AN INCIDENT._,For I was sad within to think
370,_AN INCIDENT._,"Of this absorbing love of gain,"
371,_AN INCIDENT._,And various thoughts my bosom tost;
372,_AN INCIDENT._,"When suddenly my path there crossed,"
373,_AN INCIDENT._,"Locked hand in hand with one another,"
374,_AN INCIDENT._,A little maiden and her brother—
375,_AN INCIDENT._,"A little maiden, and she wore"
376,_AN INCIDENT._,Around her waist a pinafore.
377,_AN INCIDENT._,
378,_AN INCIDENT._,And hand in hand along the street
379,_AN INCIDENT._,"This pretty pair did softly go,"
380,_AN INCIDENT._,"And as they went, their little feet"
381,_AN INCIDENT._,Moved in short even steps and slow:
382,_AN INCIDENT._,"It was a sight to see and bless,"
383,_AN INCIDENT._,That little sister’s tenderness;
384,_AN INCIDENT._,One hand a tidy basket bore
385,_AN INCIDENT._,"Of flowers and fruit—a chosen store,"
386,_AN INCIDENT._,Such as kind friends oft send to others—
387,_AN INCIDENT._,And one was fastened in her brother’s.
388,_AN INCIDENT._,
389,_AN INCIDENT._,"It was a voice of meaning sweet,"
390,_AN INCIDENT._,And spake amid that scene of strife
391,_AN INCIDENT._,"Of home and homely duties meet,"
392,_AN INCIDENT._,And charities of daily life;
393,_AN INCIDENT._,"And often, should my spirit fail,"
394,_AN INCIDENT._,"And under cold strange glances quail,"
395,_AN INCIDENT._,"’Mid busy shops and busier throng,"
396,_AN INCIDENT._,That speed upon their ways along
397,_AN INCIDENT._,"The thick and crowded thoroughfare,"
398,_AN INCIDENT._,I’ll call to mind that little pair.

408,_THE THREAD OF TRUTH._,How rich the converse! ’Tis a vein of ore
409,_THE THREAD OF TRUTH._,"Emerging now and then on Earth’s rude breast,"

411,_THE THREAD OF TRUTH._,"At distant intervals on Ocean’s face,"

1688,SCENE I.,"Belied my own soul’s self. I too have heard,"
1689,SCENE I.,"And listened, too, to a voice that in my ear"
1690,SCENE I.,"Hissed the temptation to curse God, or worse,"
1691,SCENE I.,"And yet more frequent, curse myself and die;"
1692,SCENE I.,"Until, in fine, I have begun to half believe"
1693,SCENE I.,"_Your_ dream _my_ dream too, and the dream of both"
1694,SCENE I.,No dream but dread reality; have shared
1695,SCENE I.,"Your fright: e’en so share thou, sweet life, my hope;"
1696,SCENE I.,"I too, again, when weeds with growth perverse"
1697,SCENE I.,"Have choked my corn and marred a season’s toil,"
1698,SCENE I.,"Have deemed I heard in heaven abroad a cry,"
1699,SCENE I.,‘Cursed is the ground for thy sake; thou art cursed.’
1700,SCENE I.,"But oftener far, and stronger also far,"
1701,SCENE I.,"In consonance with all things out and in,"
1702,SCENE I.,"I hear a voice more searching bid me, ‘On!"
1703,SCENE I.,On! on! it is the folly of the child
1704,SCENE I.,"To choose his path and straightway think it wrong,"
1705,SCENE I.,And turn right back and lie on the ground to weep.
1706,SCENE I.,"Forward! go, conquer! work and live!’ Withal"
1707,SCENE I.,"A word comes, half command, half prophecy,"
1708,SCENE I.,"‘Forgetting things behind thee, onward press"
1709,SCENE I.,"Unto the mark of your high calling.’ Yea,"
1710,SCENE I.,"And voices, too, in woods and flowery fields"
1711,SCENE I.,"Speak confidence from budding banks and boughs,"
1712,SCENE I.,"And tell me, ‘Live and grow,’ and say, ‘Look still"
1713,SCENE I.,"Upward, spread outward, trust, be patient, live;’"
1714,SCENE I.,"Therefore, if weakness bid me curse and die,"
1715,SCENE I.,"I answer, No! I will not curse myself,"
1716,SCENE I.,"Nor aught beside; I shall not die, but live."
1717,SCENE I.,
1718,SCENE I.,_Eve._                Ah me! alas! alas!
1719,SCENE I.,"More dismally in my face stares the doubt,"
1720,SCENE I.,More heavily on my heart weighs the world.
1721,SCENE I.,Methinks
1722,SCENE I.,"The questionings of ages yet to be,"
1723,SCENE I.,"The thinkings and cross-thinkings, self-contempts,"
1724,SCENE I.,"Self-horror; all despondencies, despairs,"
1725,SCENE I.,"Of multitudinous souls on souls to come,"
1726,SCENE I.,"In me imprisoned fight, complain and cry."
1727,SCENE I.,Alas!
1728,SCENE I.,"Mystery, mystery, mystery evermore."

1732,SCENE II.,
1733,SCENE II.,"_Adam, alone._"
1734,SCENE II.,
1735,SCENE II.,"_Adam._ Misery, oh my misery! O God, God!"
1736,SCENE II.,"How could I ever, ever, could I do it?"
1737,SCENE II.,"Whither am I come? where am I? O me, miserable!"
1738,SCENE II.,"My God, my God, that I were back with Thee!"
1739,SCENE II.,O fool! O fool! O irretrievable act!
1740,SCENE II.,"Irretrievable what, I should like to know?"
1741,SCENE II.,"What act, I wonder? What is it I mean?"
1742,SCENE II.,O heaven! the spirit holds me; I must yield;
1743,SCENE II.,"Up in the air he lifts me, casts me down;"
1744,SCENE II.,"I writhe in vain, with limbs convulsed, in the void."
1745,SCENE II.,"Well, well! go idle words, babble your will;"
1746,SCENE II.,I think the fit will leave me ere I die.
1747,SCENE II.,
1748,SCENE II.,"Fool, fool! where am I? O my God! Fool, fool!"
1749,SCENE II.,"Why did we do ’t? Eve, Eve! where are you? quick!"
1750,SCENE II.,His tread is in the garden! hither it comes!
1751,SCENE II.,"Hide us, O bushes! and ye thick trees, hide!"
1752,SCENE II.,"He comes, on, on. Alack, and all these leaves,"
1753,SCENE II.,"These petty, quivering and illusive blinds,"
1754,SCENE II.,Avail us nought: the light comes in and in;
1755,SCENE II.,"Displays us to ourselves; displays—ah, shame—"
1756,SCENE II.,Unto the inquisitive day our nakedness.
1757,SCENE II.,"He comes; He calls. The large eye of His truth,"
1758,SCENE II.,"His full, severe, all-comprehending view,"
1759,SCENE II.,Fixes itself upon our guiltiness.
1760,SCENE II.,"O God, O God! what are we? what shall we be?"
1761,SCENE II.,"What is all this about, I wonder now?"
1762,SCENE II.,"Yet I am better, too. I think it will pass"
1763,SCENE II.,"’Tis going now, unless it comes again."
1764,SCENE II.,A terrible possession while it lasts.
1765,SCENE II.,"Terrible, surely; and yet indeed ’tis true."
1766,SCENE II.,E’en in my utmost impotence I find
1767,SCENE II.,A fount of strange persistence in my soul;
1768,SCENE II.,"Also, and that perchance is stronger still,"
1769,SCENE II.,"A wakeful, changeless touchstone in my brain,"
1770,SCENE II.,"Receiving, noting, testing all the while"
1771,SCENE II.,"These passing, curious, new phenomena—"
1772,SCENE II.,"Painful, and yet not painful unto it."
1773,SCENE II.,"Though tortured in the crucible I lie,"
1774,SCENE II.,"Myself my own experiment, yet still"
1775,SCENE II.,"I, or a something that is I indeed,"
1776,SCENE II.,"A living, central, and more inmost I,"
1777,SCENE II.,"Within the scales of mere exterior me’s,"
1778,SCENE II.,"I,—seem eternal, O thou God, as Thou;"
1779,SCENE II.,"Have knowledge of the evil and the good,"
1780,SCENE II.,Superior in a higher good to both.
1781,SCENE II.,"Well, well, well! it has gone from me, though still"
1782,SCENE II.,Its images remain upon me whole;
1783,SCENE II.,And undisplaced upon my mind I view
1784,SCENE II.,The reflex of the total seizure past.
1785,SCENE II.,"Really now, had I only time and space,"
1786,SCENE II.,"And were not troubled with this wife of mine,"
1787,SCENE II.,And the necessity of meat and drink—
1788,SCENE II.,"I really do believe,"
1789,SCENE II.,"With time and space and proper quietude,"
1790,SCENE II.,I could resolve the problem in my brain.
1791,SCENE II.,"But, no; I scarce can stay one moment more"
1792,SCENE II.,To watch the curious seething process out.
1793,SCENE II.,If I could only dare to let Eve see
1794,SCENE II.,"These operations, it is like enough"
1795,SCENE II.,Between us two we two could make it out.
1796,SCENE II.,But she would be so frightened—think it proof
1797,SCENE II.,Of all her own imaginings. ’Twill not do;
1798,SCENE II.,So as it is
1799,SCENE II.,"I must e’en put a cheery face on it,"
1800,SCENE II.,"Suppress the whole, rub off the unfinished thoughts,"
1801,SCENE II.,"For fear she read them. O, ’tis pity indeed,"
1802,SCENE II.,But confidence is the one and main thing now:
1803,SCENE II.,"Who loses confidence, he loses all."
1804,SCENE II.,A demi-grain of cowardice in me
1805,SCENE II.,"Avowed, were poison to the whole mankind;"
1806,SCENE II.,"When men are plentier, ’twill be time to try;"
1807,SCENE II.,"At present, no."
1808,SCENE II.,No;
1809,SCENE II.,Shake it all up and go.
1810,SCENE II.,"That is the word, and that must be obeyed."
1811,SCENE II.,I must be off. But yet again some day
1812,SCENE II.,"Again will I resume it; if not I,"
1813,SCENE II.,I in some child of late posterity.
1814,SCENE II.,"Yes, yes, I feel it; it is here the seed,"
1815,SCENE II.,"Here in my head; but, O thou Power unseen,"
1816,SCENE II.,"In whom we live and move and have our being,"
1817,SCENE II.,"Let it not perish; grant, unlost, unhurt,"
1818,SCENE II.,"In long transmission, this rich atom some day,"
1819,SCENE II.,In some posterity of distant years—
1820,SCENE II.,How many thou intendest to have I know not—
1821,SCENE II.,"In some matured and procreant human brain,"
1822,SCENE II.,"May germinate, burst, and rise into a tree."
1823,SCENE II.,No; I shall not tell Eve.

1830,SCENE III.,_Adam and Eve._
1831,SCENE III.,
1832,SCENE III.,"_Eve._ Oh, Adam, I am comforted indeed;"
1833,SCENE III.,Where is he? O my little one!
1834,SCENE III.,"My heart is in the garden as of old,"
1835,SCENE III.,And Paradise come back.
1836,SCENE III.,
1837,SCENE III.,"_Adam._                  My love,"
1838,SCENE III.,Blessed be this good day to thee indeed;
1839,SCENE III.,Blessed the balm of joy unto thy soul.
1840,SCENE III.,A sad unskilful nurse was I to thee;
1841,SCENE III.,"But nature teaches mothers, I perceive."
1842,SCENE III.,
1843,SCENE III.,"_Eve._ But you, my husband, you meantime, I feel,"
1844,SCENE III.,Join not your perfect spirit in my joy.
1845,SCENE III.,"No; your spirit mixes not, I feel, with mine."
1846,SCENE III.,
1847,SCENE III.,"_Adam._ Alas! sweet love, for many a weary day,"
1848,SCENE III.,You and not I have borne this heavy weight:
1849,SCENE III.,"How can I, should I, might I feel your bliss,"
1850,SCENE III.,"Now heaviness is changed to glory? Long,"
1851,SCENE III.,"In long and unparticipated pangs,"
1852,SCENE III.,Your heart hath known its own great bitterness:
1853,SCENE III.,"How should, in this its jubilant release,"
1854,SCENE III.,A stranger intermeddle with its joy?
1855,SCENE III.,
1856,SCENE III.,"_Eve._ My husband, there is more in it than this;"
1857,SCENE III.,"Nay, you are surely, positively sad."
1858,SCENE III.,
1859,SCENE III.,"_Adam._ What if I was (and yet I think I am not),"
1860,SCENE III.,’Twere but the silly and contrarious mood
1861,SCENE III.,Of one whose sympathies refuse to mix
1862,SCENE III.,In aught not felt immediate from himself.
1863,SCENE III.,"But of a truth,"
1864,SCENE III.,Your joy is greater—mine seems therefore none.
1865,SCENE III.,
1866,SCENE III.,"_Eve._ Nay, neither this I think nor that is true."
1867,SCENE III.,"Evermore still you love to cheat me, Adam:"
1868,SCENE III.,You hide from me your thoughts like evil beasts
1869,SCENE III.,"Most foolishly; for I, thus left to guess,"
1870,SCENE III.,"Catch at all hints, and where perchance one is,"
1871,SCENE III.,"People the forest with a hundred ills,"
1872,SCENE III.,Each worse perhaps a hundred times than it.
1873,SCENE III.,"No; you have got some fearful thoughts—no, no;"
1874,SCENE III.,"Look not in that way on my baby, Adam—"
1875,SCENE III.,You do it hurt; you shall not!
1876,SCENE III.,
1877,SCENE III.,"_Adam._                        Hear me, Eve,"
1878,SCENE III.,If hear you will—and speak I think I must—
1879,SCENE III.,Hear me.
1880,SCENE III.,What is it I would say? I think—
1881,SCENE III.,"And yet I must—so hear me, mother blest,"
1882,SCENE III.,"That sittest with thy nursling at thy heart,"
1883,SCENE III.,"Hope not too greatly, neither fear for him,"
1884,SCENE III.,"Feeling on thy breast his small compressing lips,"
1885,SCENE III.,And glorying in the gift they draw from thee;
1886,SCENE III.,Hope not too greatly in thyself and him.
1887,SCENE III.,"And hear me, O young mother—I must speak."
1888,SCENE III.,"This child is born of us, and therefore like us;"
1889,SCENE III.,"Is born of us, and therefore is as we;"
1890,SCENE III.,"Is born of us, and therefore is not pure;"
1891,SCENE III.,Earthy as well as godlike; bound to strive—
1892,SCENE III.,Not doubtfully I augur from the past—
1893,SCENE III.,"Through the same straits of anguish and of doubt,"
1894,SCENE III.,"’Mid the same storms of terror and alarm,"
1895,SCENE III.,"To the calm ocean which he yet shall reach,"
1896,SCENE III.,"He or himself or in his sons hereafter,"
1897,SCENE III.,Of consummated consciousness of self.
1898,SCENE III.,The selfsame stuff which wrought in us to grief
1899,SCENE III.,Runs in his veins; and what to work in him?
1900,SCENE III.,"What shape of unsuspected deep disguise,"
1901,SCENE III.,"Transcending our experience, our best cares"
1902,SCENE III.,"Baffling, evading all preventive thought,"
1903,SCENE III.,"Will the old mischief choose, I wonder, here?"
1904,SCENE III.,O born to human trouble! also born—
1905,SCENE III.,"Else wherefore born—to some diviner lot,"
1906,SCENE III.,"Live, and may chance treat thee no worse than us"
1907,SCENE III.,"There, I have done: the dangerous stuff is out;"
1908,SCENE III.,"My mind is freed. And now, my gentle Eve,"
1909,SCENE III.,"Forgive thy foolish spouse, and let me set"
1910,SCENE III.,"A father’s kiss upon these budding lips,"
1911,SCENE III.,A husband’s on the mother’s—the full flower.
1912,SCENE III.,"There, there; and so, my own and only wife,"
1913,SCENE III.,"Believe me, my worst thought is now to learn"
1914,SCENE III.,How best and most to serve this child and thee.
1915,SCENE III.,"This child is born of us, and therefore like us—"
1916,SCENE III.,"Most true, mine own; and if a man like me"
1917,SCENE III.,"Externally, internally I trust"
1918,SCENE III.,"Most like to thee, the better of the twain."
1919,SCENE III.,"Is born of us, and therefore is not pure—"
1920,SCENE III.,Did I say that? I know not what I said;
1921,SCENE III.,"It was a foolish humour; but, indeed,"
1922,SCENE III.,"Whatever you may think, I have not learnt"
1923,SCENE III.,"The trick of deep suppression, e’en the skill"
1924,SCENE III.,To sort my thoughts and sift my words enough.
1925,SCENE III.,"Not pure, indeed!—And if it is not pure,"
1926,SCENE III.,"What is? Ah, well! but most I look to the days"
1927,SCENE III.,"When these small arms, with pliant thews filled out."
1928,SCENE III.,"Shall at my side break up the fruitful glebe,"
1929,SCENE III.,And aid the cheery labours of the year—
1930,SCENE III.,"Aid, or, in feebler wearier years, replace,"
1931,SCENE III.,And leave me longer hours for home and love.
1932,SCENE III.,

1934,SCENE IV.,SCENE IV.
1935,SCENE IV.,
1936,SCENE IV.,_Adam and Eve._
1937,SCENE IV.,
1938,SCENE IV.,"_Eve._ O Adam, it was I was godless then;"
1939,SCENE IV.,"But you were mournful, heavy, but composed."
1940,SCENE IV.,At times would somewhat fiercely bite your lip
1941,SCENE IV.,And pass your hand about your brow; but still
1942,SCENE IV.,"Held out, denied not God, acknowledged still"
1943,SCENE IV.,"Those glories that were gone. No, I never"
1944,SCENE IV.,Felt all your worth to me before; I feel
1945,SCENE IV.,You did not fall as I did.
1946,SCENE IV.,
1947,SCENE IV.,"_Adam._                    Nay, my child,"
1948,SCENE IV.,About our falls I don’t profess to know.
1949,SCENE IV.,I know I ne’er was innocent as thou;
1950,SCENE IV.,"I only know, as you will have it so,"
1951,SCENE IV.,"Were your descent more lengthy than was mine,"
1952,SCENE IV.,"It is not that your place is lower now,"
1953,SCENE IV.,But that first ’twas higher up than mine;
1954,SCENE IV.,"It is, that I being bestial, you divine,"
1955,SCENE IV.,We now alike are human beings both.
1956,SCENE IV.,"About our fall I won’t profess to know,"
1957,SCENE IV.,"But know I do,"
1958,SCENE IV.,That I was never innocent as thou.
1959,SCENE IV.,"Moping again, my love; yes, I dare swear,"
1960,SCENE IV.,"All the day long while I have been at work,"
1961,SCENE IV.,With some religious folly in your head.
1962,SCENE IV.,
1963,SCENE IV.,"_Eve._ No, Adam, I am cheerful quite to-day;"
1964,SCENE IV.,"I vary much, indeed, from hour to hour,"
1965,SCENE IV.,But since my baby’s birth I am happier far;
1966,SCENE IV.,And I have done some work as well as you.
1967,SCENE IV.,
1968,SCENE IV.,_Adam._ What is it tho’? for I will take my oath
1969,SCENE IV.,You’ve got some fancy stirring in your brain.
1970,SCENE IV.,
1971,SCENE IV.,"_Eve._ Nay, but it vexes me for evermore"
1972,SCENE IV.,To find in you no credence to my thought.
1973,SCENE IV.,
1974,SCENE IV.,_Adam._ What is it then you wish me to subscribe to?
1975,SCENE IV.,"That we were in a garden put by God,"
1976,SCENE IV.,Allowed to eat of all the trees but one.
1977,SCENE IV.,"Somehow—I don’t know how—a serpent tempted us,"
1978,SCENE IV.,"And eat we did, and so were doomed to die;"
1979,SCENE IV.,Whereas before we were meant to live for ever.
1980,SCENE IV.,"Meantime, turned out——"
1981,SCENE IV.,
1982,SCENE IV.,"_Eve._                You do not think then, Adam,"
1983,SCENE IV.,We have been disobedient unto God?
1984,SCENE IV.,
1985,SCENE IV.,"_Adam._ My child, how should I know, and what do you mean?"
1986,SCENE IV.,Your question’s not so simple as it looks;
1987,SCENE IV.,For if you mean that God said this or that—
1988,SCENE IV.,"As that ‘You shall not touch those apples there,’"
1989,SCENE IV.,"And that we did—why, all that I can say"
1990,SCENE IV.,"Is, that I can’t conceive the thing to be."
1991,SCENE IV.,"But if it were so, I should then believe"
1992,SCENE IV.,"We had done right—at any rate, no harm."
1993,SCENE IV.,
1994,SCENE IV.,"_Eve._ O Adam, I can scarcely think I hear;"
1995,SCENE IV.,For if God said to us—God being God—
1996,SCENE IV.,"‘You shall not,’ is not His commandment His?"
1997,SCENE IV.,And are not we the creatures He hath made?
1998,SCENE IV.,
1999,SCENE IV.,"_Adam._ My child, God does not speak to human minds"
2000,SCENE IV.,In that unmeaning arbitrary way.
2001,SCENE IV.,"God were not God if so, and good not good."
2002,SCENE IV.,"Search in your heart, and if you tell me there"
2003,SCENE IV.,"You find a genuine voice—no fancy, mind you—"
2004,SCENE IV.,"Declaring to you this or that is evil,"
2005,SCENE IV.,"Why, this or that I daresay evil is."
2006,SCENE IV.,"Believe me, I will listen to the word;"
2007,SCENE IV.,For not by observation of without
2008,SCENE IV.,Cometh the kingdom of the voice of God:
2009,SCENE IV.,It is within us—let us seek it there.
2010,SCENE IV.,
2011,SCENE IV.,"_Eve._ Yet I have voices, surely, in my heart."
2012,SCENE IV.,Often you say I heed them over much.
2013,SCENE IV.,
2014,SCENE IV.,_Adam._ God’s voice is of the heart: I do not say
2015,SCENE IV.,"All voices, therefore, of the heart are God’s;"
2016,SCENE IV.,And to discern the voice amidst the voices
2017,SCENE IV.,"Is that hard task, my love, that we are born to."
2018,SCENE IV.,
2019,SCENE IV.,"_Eve._ Ah me, in me I am sure the one, one voice"
2020,SCENE IV.,Goes somehow to the sense of what I say—
2021,SCENE IV.,The sense of disobedience to God.
2022,SCENE IV.,"O Adam, some way, some time, we have done wrong,"
2023,SCENE IV.,"And when I think of this, I still must think"
2024,SCENE IV.,"Of Paradise, and of the stately tree"
2025,SCENE IV.,"Which in the middle of the garden grew,"
2026,SCENE IV.,"The golden fruit that hung upon its boughs,"
2027,SCENE IV.,"Of which but once we ate, and I must feel"
2028,SCENE IV.,That whereas once in His continual sight
2029,SCENE IV.,"We lived, in daily communing with Him,"
2030,SCENE IV.,"We now are banished, and behold not Him."
2031,SCENE IV.,"Our only present communing, alas!"
2032,SCENE IV.,"Is penitential mourning, and the gaze"
2033,SCENE IV.,Of the abased and prostrate prayerful soul;
2034,SCENE IV.,"But you, yourself, my Adam, you at least"
2035,SCENE IV.,Acknowledge some time somehow we did wrong.
2036,SCENE IV.,
2037,SCENE IV.,"_Adam._ My child, I never even granted that."
2038,SCENE IV.,
2039,SCENE IV.,"_Eve._ Oh, but you let strange words at times fall from you."
2040,SCENE IV.,They are to me like thunderbolts from heaven;
2041,SCENE IV.,"I listen terrified and sick at heart,"
2042,SCENE IV.,Then haste and pick them up and treasure them.
2043,SCENE IV.,What was it that you said when Cain was born?
2044,SCENE IV.,‘He’s born of us and therefore is not pure.’
2045,SCENE IV.,"O, you corrected well, my husband, then"
2046,SCENE IV.,"My foolish, fond exuberance of delight."
2047,SCENE IV.,
2048,SCENE IV.,"_Adam._ My child, believe me, truly I was the fool;"
2049,SCENE IV.,But a first baby is a strange surprise.
2050,SCENE IV.,I shall not say so when another comes;
2051,SCENE IV.,And I beseech you treasure up no words.
2052,SCENE IV.,You know me: I am loose of tongue and light.
2053,SCENE IV.,"I beg you, Eve, remember nought of this;"
2054,SCENE IV.,"Put not at least, I pray you—nay, command—"
2055,SCENE IV.,"Put not, when days come on, your own strange whim"
2056,SCENE IV.,And misconstruction of my idle words
2057,SCENE IV.,Into the tender brains of our poor young ones.
2058,SCENE IV.,
2059,SCENE IV.,
2060,SCENE V.,SCENE V.
2061,SCENE V.,
2062,SCENE V.,_Adam with Cain and Abel._
2063,SCENE V.,
2064,SCENE V.,"_Adam._                    Cain, beware!"
2065,SCENE V.,"Strike not your brother! I have said, beware!"
2066,SCENE V.,"A heavy curse is on this thing, my son."
2067,SCENE V.,"With doubt and fear,"
2068,SCENE V.,"Terror and toil and pain already here,"
2069,SCENE V.,"Let us not have injustice too, my son."
2070,SCENE V.,"So Cain, beware!"
2071,SCENE V.,"And Abel, too, see you provoke him not."
2072,SCENE V.,
2073,SCENE V.,
2074,SCENE VI.,SCENE VI.
2075,SCENE VI.,
2076,SCENE VI.,_Abel alone._
2077,SCENE VI.,
2078,SCENE VI.,_Abel._            At times I could believe
2079,SCENE VI.,My father is no better than his son:
2080,SCENE VI.,"If not as overbearing, proud and hard,"
2081,SCENE VI.,"Yet prayerless, worldly, almost more than Cain."
2082,SCENE VI.,"Enlighten and convert him ere the end,"
2083,SCENE VI.,My God! spurn not my mother’s prayers and mine.
2084,SCENE VI.,"Since I was born, was I not left to Thee,"
2085,SCENE VI.,"In an unspiritual and godless house,"
2086,SCENE VI.,Unfathered and unbrothered—Thine and hers?
2087,SCENE VI.,They think not of the fall: e’en less they think
2088,SCENE VI.,"Of the redemption, which God said should be;"
2089,SCENE VI.,"Which, for we apprehend it by our faith,"
2090,SCENE VI.,Already is—is come for her and me.
2091,SCENE VI.,"Yea, though I sin, my sin is not to death;"
2092,SCENE VI.,"In my repentance I have joy, such joy"
2093,SCENE VI.,That almost I could sin to seek for it—
2094,SCENE VI.,"Yea, if I did not hate it and abhor,"
2095,SCENE VI.,"And know that Thou abhorr’st and hatest it,"
2096,SCENE VI.,"And will’st, for an example to the rest,"
2097,SCENE VI.,That Thine elect should keep themselves from it.
2098,SCENE VI.,Alas!
2099,SCENE VI.,My mother calls the fall a mystery;
2100,SCENE VI.,"Redemption is so too. But oh, my God,"
2101,SCENE VI.,Thou wilt bring all things in the end to good.
2102,SCENE VI.,"Yea, though the whole earth lie in wickedness, I"
2103,SCENE VI.,"Am with Thee, with Thee, with Thee evermore"
2104,SCENE VI.,"Ah, yet I am not satisfied with this!"
2105,SCENE VI.,"Am I not feeding spiritual pride,"
2106,SCENE VI.,"Rejoicing over sinners, inelect"
2107,SCENE VI.,And unadmitted to the fellowship
2108,SCENE VI.,"Which I, unworthy, most unworthy, share?"
2109,SCENE VI.,What can I do—how can I help it then?
2110,SCENE VI.,"O God, remove it from my heart; pluck out,"
2111,SCENE VI.,"Whatever pain, whatever wrench to me,"
2112,SCENE VI.,"These sinful roots and remnants which, whate’er"
2113,SCENE VI.,"I do, how high so e’er I soar from earth,"
2114,SCENE VI.,"Still, undestroyed, still germinate within."
2115,SCENE VI.,"Take them away in Thy good time, O God."
2116,SCENE VI.,"Meantime, for that atonement’s precious sake"
2117,SCENE VI.,Which in Thy counsels predetermined works
2118,SCENE VI.,"Already to the saving of the saints,"
2119,SCENE VI.,"O Father, view with mercy, and forgive;"
2120,SCENE VI.,"Nor let my vexed perception of my sin,"
2121,SCENE VI.,"Nor any multitude of evil thoughts,"
2122,SCENE VI.,"Crowding like demons in my spirit’s house,"
2123,SCENE VI.,"Nor life, nor death, things here or things below,"
2124,SCENE VI.,Cast out the sweet assurance of my soul
2125,SCENE VI.,"That I am Thine, and Thou art mine, my God."

2135,SCENE VII.,My father does not shun me—there’s my comfort:
2136,SCENE VII.,Almost I think they look askance on him.
2137,SCENE VII.,"Ah, but for him,"
2138,SCENE VII.,I know not what might happen; for at times
2139,SCENE VII.,Ungovernable angers take the waves
2140,SCENE VII.,Of my deep soul and sweep them—who knows whither?
2141,SCENE VII.,"And a strange impulse, struggling to the truth,"
2142,SCENE VII.,"Urges me onward to put forth my strength,"
2143,SCENE VII.,No matter how. A wild anxiety
2144,SCENE VII.,Possesses me moreover to essay
2145,SCENE VII.,This world of action round me so unknown;
2146,SCENE VII.,And to be able to do this or that
2147,SCENE VII.,"Seems cause enough without a cause for doing it,"
2148,SCENE VII.,"My father, he is cheerful and content,"
2149,SCENE VII.,"And leads me frankly forward. Yet, indeed,"
2150,SCENE VII.,"His leading—or, more truly, to be led"
2151,SCENE VII.,"At all, by any one, and not myself—"
2152,SCENE VII.,Is mere dissatisfaction: evermore
2153,SCENE VII.,"Something I must do individual,"
2154,SCENE VII.,"To vindicate my nature, to give proof"

2166,SCENE VIII.,Besides the superstitious search of signs
2167,SCENE VIII.,"In merest accidents of earth and air,"
2168,SCENE VIII.,"They cause, I think, a sort of jealousy—"
2169,SCENE VIII.,"Ill-blood. Hark, now!"

2184,SCENE IX.,Still as a log—still as his own dead lamb.
2185,SCENE IX.,Dead is it then? O wonderful! O strange!
2186,SCENE IX.,Dead! dead! And we can slay each other then?
2187,SCENE IX.,"If we are wronged, why we can right ourselves;"
2188,SCENE IX.,If we are plagued and pestered with a fool
2189,SCENE IX.,"That will not let us be, nor leave us room"
2190,SCENE IX.,"To do our will and shape our path in peace,"
2191,SCENE IX.,We can be rid of him. There—he is gone;
2192,SCENE IX.,"Victory! victory! victory! My heaven,"
2193,SCENE IX.,"Methinks, from infinite distances borne back,"
2194,SCENE IX.,It comes to me re-borne—in multitude
2195,SCENE IX.,"Echoed, re-echoed, and re-echoed again,"
2196,SCENE IX.,"Victory! victory!—distant, yet distinct—"
2197,SCENE IX.,Uncountable times repeated. O ye gods!
2198,SCENE IX.,"Where am I come, and whither am I borne?"
2199,SCENE IX.,"I stand upon the pinnacle of earth,"
2200,SCENE IX.,And hear the wild seas laughing at my feet;
2201,SCENE IX.,Yet I could wish that he had struggled more—
2202,SCENE IX.,That passiveness was disappointing. Ha!
2203,SCENE IX.,"He should have writhed and wrestled in my arms,"
2204,SCENE IX.,"And all but overcome, and set his knee"
2205,SCENE IX.,"Hard on my chest, till I—all faint, yet still"
2206,SCENE IX.,"Holding my fingers at his throat—at last,"
2207,SCENE IX.,"Inch after inch, had forced him to relax:"
2208,SCENE IX.,"But he went down at once, without a word,"
2209,SCENE IX.,Almost without a look.
2210,SCENE IX.,Ah!—hush! My God!
2211,SCENE IX.,Who was it spoke? What is this questioner?
2212,SCENE IX.,Who was it asked me where my brother is?
2213,SCENE IX.,"Ha, ha! Was I his keeper? I know not."
2214,SCENE IX.,Each for himself; he might have struck again.
2215,SCENE IX.,Why did he not? I wished him to. Was I
2216,SCENE IX.,"To strike for both at once? No! Yet, ah!"
2217,SCENE IX.,"Where is thy brother? Peace, thou silly voice;"
2218,SCENE IX.,"Am I my brother’s keeper? I know not,"
2219,SCENE IX.,I know not aught about it; let it be.
2220,SCENE IX.,"Henceforth I shall walk freely upon earth,"
2221,SCENE IX.,"And know my will, and do it by my might."
2222,SCENE IX.,My God!—it will not be at peace—my God!
2223,SCENE IX.,It flames; it bursts to fury in my soul.
2224,SCENE IX.,What is it that will come of this? Ah me!
2225,SCENE IX.,What is it I have done?—Almighty God!
2226,SCENE IX.,"I see it; I behold it as it is,"
2227,SCENE IX.,As it will be in all the times to come:
2228,SCENE IX.,"Slaughter on slaughter, blood for blood, and death,"

2241,SCENE X.,"Well, we must hope in Seth. This merest man,"
2242,SCENE X.,"This unambitious commonplace of life,"
2243,SCENE X.,Will after all perhaps mend all; and though

2269,SCENE XI.,For there are rites and holy means of grace
2270,SCENE XI.,Of God ordained for man’s eternal [weal].
2271,SCENE XI.,"With these, my son, address thyself to Him,"
2272,SCENE XI.,"And seek atonement from a gracious God,"

2274,SCENE XI.,
2275,SCENE XI.,"_Cain._ I ask not for atonement, mother mine;"
2276,SCENE XI.,I ask but one thing—never to forget.
2277,SCENE XI.,I ask but—not to add to one great crime
2278,SCENE XI.,Another self-delusion scarcely less.
2279,SCENE XI.,"I _could_ ask more, but more I know is sin."
2280,SCENE XI.,"If sacrifices and the fat of lambs,"
2281,SCENE XI.,"And whole burnt-offerings upon piles of turf,"
2282,SCENE XI.,"Will bring me this, I’d fill the heaven with smoke,"
2283,SCENE XI.,And deface earth with million fiery scars.
2284,SCENE XI.,"I _could_ ask back (and think it but my right,"

2289,SCENE XI.,Ended for ever; but that I know this vain.

2293,SCENE XI.,_Eve._ You ask not for atonement! O my son—
2294,SCENE XI.,"Cain, you are proud and hard of heart e’en now."
2295,SCENE XI.,Beware!
2296,SCENE XI.,"Prostrate your soul in penitential prayer,"
2297,SCENE XI.,Humble your heart beneath the mighty hand
2298,SCENE XI.,"Of God, whose gracious guidance oft shall lead"
2299,SCENE XI.,Through sin and crime the changed and melted heart
2300,SCENE XI.,To sweet repentance and the sense of Him.

2311,SCENE XI.,Which I profess not knowledge of: it may be
2312,SCENE XI.,"That this is so; if so, may God reveal it."
2313,SCENE XI.,"Have faith you too in my heart’s secrets; yea,"

2349,SCENE XII.,"_Cain._ My father, this is true, I know; but yet,"

2373,SCENE XIII.,"_Cain._ Curse me, my father, ere I go. Your curse"

2375,SCENE XIII.,"Will make me not forget,"
2376,SCENE XIII.,"Alas! I am not of that pious kind,"
2377,SCENE XIII.,"Who, when the blot has fallen upon their life,"
2378,SCENE XIII.,Can look to heaven and think it white again—

2384,SCENE XIII.,To me the thing seems sin—the worst of sin.
2385,SCENE XIII.,"If it be so, why are we here?—the world,"
2386,SCENE XIII.,Why is it as I find it? The dull stone

2401,SCENE XIII.,That this one thing
2402,SCENE XIII.,And this one word in me must be declared;
2403,SCENE XIII.,That to forget is not to be restored;
2404,SCENE XIII.,To lose with time the sense of what we did
2405,SCENE XIII.,Cancels not that we did; what’s done remains—
2406,SCENE XIII.,I am my brother’s murderer. Woe to me!
2407,SCENE XIII.,"Abel is dead. No prayers to empty heaven,"

2415,SCENE XIII.,The restorative pulsing of the blood
2416,SCENE XIII.,That changes all and changes e’en the soul—
2417,SCENE XIII.,"And natural functions, moving as they should,"
2418,SCENE XIII.,"The sweet good-nights, the sweet delusive dreams"

2442,SCENE XIII.,"What comes, receive; be not too wise for God."
2443,SCENE XIII.,"The past is something, but the present more;"

2445,SCENE XIII.,To recognise the future in our hopes;
2446,SCENE XIII.,"Unite them in your manhood each and all,"

2451,SCENE XIII.,"Even to your mother, comfort; but to us"
2452,SCENE XIII.,"Knowledge, at least—the certainty of things"
2453,SCENE XIII.,"Which, as I think, is consolation’s sum."
2454,SCENE XIII.,"For truly now, to-day, to-morrow, yes,"
2455,SCENE XIII.,"Days many more to come, alike to you,"
2456,SCENE XIII.,Whose earliest revelation of the world
2457,SCENE XIII.,"Is, horrible indeed, this fatal fact—"

2459,SCENE XIII.,"Look gropingly and idly into this,"
2460,SCENE XIII.,And recognise no figure I have seen—
2461,SCENE XIII.,"Alike, my son, to me, and to yourself,"
2462,SCENE XIII.,Much is now dark which one day will be light;
2463,SCENE XIII.,With strong assurance fortify your soul

2493,SCENE XIV.,"And Eve said to me, ‘Adam, in the day"
2494,SCENE XIV.,"When in the inexistent void I heard God’s voice,"
2495,SCENE XIV.,"An awful whisper, bidding me to be,"
2496,SCENE XIV.,"How slow was I to come, how loth to obey;"
2497,SCENE XIV.,"As slow, as sad, as lingeringly loth,"
2498,SCENE XIV.,"I fade, I vanish, sink, and cease to be,"
2499,SCENE XIV.,By the same sovereign strong compulsion borne:
2500,SCENE XIV.,"Ah, if I vanish, take me into thee!’"
2501,SCENE XIV.,"She spoke, nor, speaking, ceased I listening; but"
2502,SCENE XIV.,"I was alone, yet not alone, with her"
2503,SCENE XIV.,"And she with me, and you with us, my sons,"
2504,SCENE XIV.,"As at the first;—and yet not wholly—yea,"
2505,SCENE XIV.,"And that which I had witnessed thus in you,"
2506,SCENE XIV.,"This fusion, and mutation, and return,"
2507,SCENE XIV.,"Seemed in my substance working too. I slept,"
2508,SCENE XIV.,"I did not dream, my sleep was sweet to me."
2509,SCENE XIV.,"Yes, in despite of all disquietudes,"
2510,SCENE XIV.,"For Eve, for you, for Abel, which indeed"
2511,SCENE XIV.,Impelled in me that gaiety of soul—
2512,SCENE XIV.,Without your fears I had listened to my own—
2513,SCENE XIV.,"In spite of doubt, despondency, and death,"
2514,SCENE XIV.,"Though lacking knowledge alway, lacking faith"
2515,SCENE XIV.,"Sometimes, and hope; with no sure trust in ought"
2516,SCENE XIV.,"Except a kind of impetus within,"
2517,SCENE XIV.,Whose sole credentials were that trust itself;
2518,SCENE XIV.,"Yet, in despite of much, in lack of more,"
2519,SCENE XIV.,"Life has been beautiful to me, my son,"
2520,SCENE XIV.,"And I, if I am called, will come again."
2521,SCENE XIV.,"As he hath lived he dies.—My comforter,"
2522,SCENE XIV.,"Whom I believed not, only trusted in,"
2523,SCENE XIV.,What had I been without thee? how survived?
2524,SCENE XIV.,Would I were with thee wheresoe’er thou art!
2525,SCENE XIV.,Would I might follow thee still!
2526,SCENE XIV.,"But sleep is sweet, and I would sleep, my son."
2527,SCENE XIV.,Oh Cain! behold your father’s words are said!

2658,_GENESIS XXIV._,"In the hour of evening,"
2659,_GENESIS XXIV._,meditating there.
2660,_GENESIS XXIV._,

2667,_GENESIS XXIV._,
2668,_GENESIS XXIV._,"But Isaac also,"
2669,_GENESIS XXIV._,"walking in the field,"
2670,_GENESIS XXIV._,Saw from afar
2671,_GENESIS XXIV._,"a company that came,"
2672,_GENESIS XXIV._,"Camels, and a seat"
2673,_GENESIS XXIV._,as where a woman sat;
2674,_GENESIS XXIV._,Wherefore he came

2688,_GENESIS XXIV._,Shall not thy husband

2690,_GENESIS XXIV._,Hundreds of kinsmen
2691,_GENESIS XXIV._,living in thy land?
2692,_GENESIS XXIV._,
2693,_GENESIS XXIV._,"And Eleazar answered,"

2695,_GENESIS XXIV._,Even according
2696,_GENESIS XXIV._,"as thy father bade,"
2697,_GENESIS XXIV._,Did we; and thus and

2701,_GENESIS XXIV._,
2702,_GENESIS XXIV._,"And, as he ended,"
2703,_GENESIS XXIV._,"Isaac spoke and said,"

2708,_GENESIS XXIV._,
2709,_GENESIS XXIV._,"Truly, O child"

2713,_GENESIS XXIV._,"Thou madest answer,"
2714,_GENESIS XXIV._,"saying, I will go."

2725,_JACOB._,"Not as my father’s or his father’s days,"
2726,_JACOB._,"As Isaac’s days or Abraham’s, have been mine;"
2727,_JACOB._,Not as the days of those that in the field
2728,_JACOB._,"Walked at the eventide to meditate,"
2729,_JACOB._,"And haply, to the tent returning, found"
2730,_JACOB._,Angels at nightfall waiting at their door.
2731,_JACOB._,"They communed, Israel wrestled with the Lord."
2732,_JACOB._,"No, not as Abraham’s or as Isaac’s days,"
2733,_JACOB._,"My sons, have been Jacob your father’s days,"

2739,_JACOB._,"But I have had to force mine eyes away,"
2740,_JACOB._,"To lose, almost to shun, the thoughts I loved,"
2741,_JACOB._,"To bend down to the work, to bare the breast,"
2742,_JACOB._,"And struggle, feet and hands, with enemies;"
2743,_JACOB._,"To buffet and to battle with hard men,"
2744,_JACOB._,With men of selfishness and violence;
2745,_JACOB._,"To watch by day, and calculate by night,"
2746,_JACOB._,"To plot and think of plots, and through a land"

2748,_JACOB._,To win with art safe wisdom’s peaceful way.
2749,_JACOB._,"Alas! I know, and from the onset knew,"
2750,_JACOB._,"The first-born faith, the singleness of soul,"
2751,_JACOB._,The antique pure simplicity with which
2752,_JACOB._,"God and good angels communed undispleased,"
2753,_JACOB._,"Is not; it shall not any more be said,"
2754,_JACOB._,"That of a blameless and a holy kind,"
2755,_JACOB._,"The chosen race, the seed of promise, comes."
2756,_JACOB._,"The royal, high prerogatives, the dower"
2757,_JACOB._,"Of innocence and perfectness of life,"
2758,_JACOB._,"Pass not unto my children from their sire,"
2759,_JACOB._,As unto me they came of mine; they fit
2760,_JACOB._,Neither to Jacob nor to Jacob’s race.
2761,_JACOB._,"Think ye, my sons, in this extreme old age"
2762,_JACOB._,"And in this failing breath, that I forget"
2763,_JACOB._,"How on the day when from my father’s door,"
2764,_JACOB._,"In bitterness and ruefulness of heart,"
2765,_JACOB._,"I from my parents set my face, and felt"
2766,_JACOB._,"I never more again should look on theirs,"
2767,_JACOB._,How on that day I seemed unto myself
2768,_JACOB._,"Another Adam from his home cast out,"
2769,_JACOB._,"And driven abroad unto a barren land,"
2770,_JACOB._,"Cursed for his sake, and mocking still with thorns"
2771,_JACOB._,And briers that labour and that sweat of brow
2772,_JACOB._,"He still must spend to live? Sick of my days,"
2773,_JACOB._,"I wished not life, but cried out, Let me die;"
2774,_JACOB._,But at Luz God came to me; in my heart
2775,_JACOB._,"He put a better mind, and showed me how,"
2776,_JACOB._,"While we discern it not, and least believe,"
2777,_JACOB._,On stairs invisible betwixt His heaven
2778,_JACOB._,"And our unholy, sinful, toilsome earth"
2779,_JACOB._,Celestial messengers of loftiest good
2780,_JACOB._,Upward and downward pass continually.
2781,_JACOB._,"Many, since I upon the field of Luz"
2782,_JACOB._,"Set up the stone I slept on, unto God,"
2783,_JACOB._,Many have been the troubles of my life;
2784,_JACOB._,"Sins in the field and sorrows in the tent,"
2785,_JACOB._,"In mine own household anguish and despair,"
2786,_JACOB._,And gall and wormwood mingled with my love.
2787,_JACOB._,The time would fail me should I seek to tell
2788,_JACOB._,Of a child wronged and cruelly revenged
2789,_JACOB._,"(Accursed was that anger, it was fierce,"
2790,_JACOB._,"That wrath, for it was cruel); or of strife"
2791,_JACOB._,"And jealousy and cowardice, with lies"
2792,_JACOB._,"Mocking a father’s misery; deeds of blood,"
2793,_JACOB._,"Pollutions, sicknesses, and sudden deaths."
2794,_JACOB._,"These many things against me many times,"
2795,_JACOB._,"The ploughers have ploughed deep upon my back,"
2796,_JACOB._,And made deep furrows; blessed be His name
2797,_JACOB._,"Who hath delivered Jacob out of all,"
2798,_JACOB._,And left within his spirit hope of good.
2799,_JACOB._,
2800,_JACOB._,"Come near to me, my sons: your father goes,"
2801,_JACOB._,The hour of his departure draweth nigh.
2802,_JACOB._,"Ah me! this eager rivalry of life,"
2803,_JACOB._,"This cruel conflict for pre-eminence,"
2804,_JACOB._,"This keen supplanting of the dearest kin,"
2805,_JACOB._,Quick seizure and fast unrelaxing hold
2806,_JACOB._,"Of vantage-place; the stony hard resolve,"
2807,_JACOB._,"The chase, the competition, and the craft"
2808,_JACOB._,"Which seems to be the poison of our life,"
2809,_JACOB._,And yet is the condition of our life!
2810,_JACOB._,To have done things on which the eye with shame
2811,_JACOB._,"Looks back, the closed hand clutching still the prize!—"
2812,_JACOB._,Alas! what of all these things shall I say?
2813,_JACOB._,"Take me away unto Thy sleep, O God!"
2814,_JACOB._,"I thank Thee it is over, yet I think"
2815,_JACOB._,It was a work appointed me of Thee.
2816,_JACOB._,How is it? I have striven all my days
2817,_JACOB._,"To do my duty to my house and hearth,"
2818,_JACOB._,"And to the purpose of my father’s race,"
2819,_JACOB._,Yet is my heart therewith not satisfied.

2827,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"By the tent door, a palm-tree overhead,"
2828,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"A spring beside him, and the sheep around."

2836,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And Rachel said, Come, O my Jacob, come;"
2837,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And we will think we sit beside the well,"
2838,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"As in that day, the long long years agone,"
2839,_JACOB’S WIVES._,When first I met thee with my father’s flock.
2840,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2841,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And Leah said, Come, Israel, unto me;"
2842,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And thou shalt reap an harvest of fair sons,"
2843,_JACOB’S WIVES._,E’en as before I bare thee goodly babes;
2844,_JACOB’S WIVES._,For when was Leah fruitless to my lord?
2845,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2846,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And Rachel said, Ah come! as then thou cam’st,"
2847,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Come once again to set thy seal of love;
2848,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"As then, down bending, when the sheep had drunk,"
2849,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Then settedst it, my shepherd—O sweet seal!—"
2850,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Upon the unwitting, half-foretasting lips,"
2851,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Which, shy and trembling, thirsted yet for thine"
2852,_JACOB’S WIVES._,As cattle thirsted never for the spring.
2853,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2854,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And Leah answered, Are not these their names—"

2886,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2887,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And Leah said, And wilt thou dare to say,"

2897,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2898,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And Rachel said, But what to supersede"
2899,_JACOB’S WIVES._,The rights which choice bestowed hath Leah done?
2900,_JACOB’S WIVES._,What which my handmaid or which hers hath not?
2901,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Is Simeon more than Naphtali? is Dan
2902,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Less than his brother Levi in the house?
2903,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"That part that Billah and that Zilpah have,"
2904,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"That, and no more, hath Leah in her lord;"

2909,_JACOB’S WIVES._,With serious aims and forward-working hopes—
2910,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Aims as far-reaching as to earth’s last age,"
2911,_JACOB’S WIVES._,And hopes far-travelling as from east to west?
2912,_JACOB’S WIVES._,

2921,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"The God of Abraham and of Isaac, spake"
2922,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And said, Increase, and multiply, and fill"

2924,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And I will surely do thee good, and make"
2925,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Thy seed as is the sand beside the sea,"
2926,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Which is not numbered for its multitude?
2927,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Shall Rachel bear this progeny to God?
2928,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2929,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"But Rachel wept and answered, And if God"
2930,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Hath closed the womb of Rachel until now,"
2931,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Shall He not at His pleasure open it?
2932,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Hath Leah read the counsels of the Lord?
2933,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Was it not told her, in the ancient days,"
2934,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"How Sarah, mother of great Israel’s sire,"
2935,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Lived to long years, insulted of her slave,"
2936,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Or e’er to light the Child of Promise came,"
2937,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Whom Rachel too to Jacob yet may bear?
2938,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2939,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Moreover, Rachel said, Shall Leah mock,"
2940,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Who stole the prime embraces of my love,"
2941,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"My first long-destined, long-withheld caress?"
2942,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"But not, she said, methought, but not for this,"
2943,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"In the old days, did Jacob seek his bride;—"
2944,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Where art thou now, O thou that sought’st me then?"
2945,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Where is thy loving tenderness of old?
2946,_JACOB’S WIVES._,And where that fervency of faith to which
2947,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Seven weary years were even as a few days?
2948,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2949,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And Rachel wept and ended, Ah, my life!"
2950,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Though Leah bare thee sons on sons, methought"
2951,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"The child of love, late-born, were worth them all."
2952,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2953,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And Leah groaned and answered, It is well:"
2954,_JACOB’S WIVES._,She that hath kept from me my husband’s heart
2955,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Will set their father’s soul against my sons.
2956,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Yet, also, not, she said, I thought, for this,"
2957,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Not for the feverish nor the doating love,"
2958,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Doth Israel, father of a nation, seek;"
2959,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Nor to light dalliance, as of boy and girl,"

2961,_JACOB’S WIVES._,Or lapse the wisdom of maturer mind.
2962,_JACOB’S WIVES._,
2963,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"And Leah ended, Father of my sons,"
2964,_JACOB’S WIVES._,"Come, thou shalt dream of Rachel if thou wilt,"

3553,_THE SHADOW._[5],"On Sunday morning in the roomy pew,"
3554,_THE SHADOW._[5],To see the thing with such decorum done.
3555,_THE SHADOW._[5],"As for himself, perhaps it was all one;"
3556,_THE SHADOW._[5],Yet on one’s death-bed all men always said
3557,_THE SHADOW._[5],It was a comfortable thing to think upon
3558,_THE SHADOW._[5],The atonement and the resurrection of the dead.
3559,_THE SHADOW._[5],"So the great World as having said his say,"
3560,_THE SHADOW._[5],Unto his country-house pursued his way.
3561,_THE SHADOW._[5],And on the grave the Shadow sat all day.

3565,_THE SHADOW._[5],"And the poor Pope was sure it must be so,"
3566,_THE SHADOW._[5],Else wherefore did the people kiss his toe?
3567,_THE SHADOW._[5],"The subtle Jesuit cardinal shook his head,"

3571,_THE SHADOW._[5],"Religion must be kept up, and the Church preserved,"
3572,_THE SHADOW._[5],"And for the people this best served,"
3573,_THE SHADOW._[5],"And then he turned, and added most demurely,"
3574,_THE SHADOW._[5],"‘Whatever may befal,"
3575,_THE SHADOW._[5],"We Catholics need no evidence at all,"
3576,_THE SHADOW._[5],"The holy father is infallible, surely!’"
3577,_THE SHADOW._[5],
3578,_THE SHADOW._[5],"And English canons heard,"
3579,_THE SHADOW._[5],And quietly demurred.
3580,_THE SHADOW._[5],"Religion rests on evidence, of course,"
3581,_THE SHADOW._[5],And on inquiry we must put no force.
3582,_THE SHADOW._[5],"Difficulties still, upon whatever ground,"
3583,_THE SHADOW._[5],"Are likely, almost certain, to be found."
3584,_THE SHADOW._[5],"The Theist scheme, the Pantheist, one and all,"
3585,_THE SHADOW._[5],"Must with, or e’en before, the Christian fall."
3586,_THE SHADOW._[5],"And till the thing were plainer to our eyes,"
3587,_THE SHADOW._[5],To disturb faith was surely most unwise.
3588,_THE SHADOW._[5],"As for the Shade, who trusted such narration?"
3589,_THE SHADOW._[5],"Except, of course, in ancient revelation."
3590,_THE SHADOW._[5],
3591,_THE SHADOW._[5],And dignitaries of the Church came by.
3592,_THE SHADOW._[5],"It had been worth to some of them, they said,"
3593,_THE SHADOW._[5],Some hundred thousand pounds a year a head.
3594,_THE SHADOW._[5],"If it fetched so much in the market, truly,"
3595,_THE SHADOW._[5],’Twas not a thing to be given up unduly.
3596,_THE SHADOW._[5],"It had been proved by Butler in one way,"
3597,_THE SHADOW._[5],By Paley better in a later day;
3598,_THE SHADOW._[5],"It had been proved in twenty ways at once,"
3599,_THE SHADOW._[5],By many a doctor plain to many a dunce;
3600,_THE SHADOW._[5],There was no question but it must be so.
3601,_THE SHADOW._[5],"And the Shade answered, that He did not know;"
3602,_THE SHADOW._[5],"He had no reading, and might be deceived,"
3603,_THE SHADOW._[5],"But still He was the Christ, as He believed."
3604,_THE SHADOW._[5],
3605,_THE SHADOW._[5],"And women, mild and pure,"
3606,_THE SHADOW._[5],"Forth from still homes and village schools did pass,"
3607,_THE SHADOW._[5],"And asked, if this indeed were thus, alas,"
3608,_THE SHADOW._[5],What should they teach their children and the poor?
3609,_THE SHADOW._[5],"The Shade replied, He could not know,"
3610,_THE SHADOW._[5],"But it was truth, the fact was so."

3905,PART I.,"Sarcastic, say; or were it fitter"
3906,PART I.,To style it the religious bitter?
3907,PART I.,
3908,PART I.,_Di._ Interpret it I cannot. I but wrote it—
3909,PART I.,"At Naples, truly, as the preface tells,"
3910,PART I.,"Last year, in the Toledo; it came on me,"
3911,PART I.,"And did me good at once. At Naples then,"
3912,PART I.,At Venice now. Ah! and I think at Venice
3913,PART I.,Christ is not risen either.
3914,PART I.,
3915,PART I.,"_Sp._                       Nay,"
3916,PART I.,Such things don’t fall out every day:
3917,PART I.,"Having once happened, as we know,"
3918,PART I.,"In Palestine so long ago,"
3919,PART I.,How should it now at Venice here
3920,PART I.,"Where people, true enough, appear"
3921,PART I.,To appreciate more and understand
3922,PART I.,"Their ices, and their Austrian band"
3923,PART I.,And dark-eyed girls.
3924,PART I.,
3925,PART I.,"_Di._                The whole great square they fill,"
3926,PART I.,"From the red flaunting streamers on the staffs,"
3927,PART I.,"And that barbaric portal of St. Mark’s,"
3928,PART I.,"To where, unnoticed, at the darker end,"
3929,PART I.,I sit upon my step—one great gay crowd.
3930,PART I.,The Campanile to the silent stars
3931,PART I.,"Goes up, above—its apex lost in air—"
3932,PART I.,While these do what?
3933,PART I.,
3934,PART I.,"_Sp._                Enjoy the minute,"
3935,PART I.,And the substantial blessings in it:
3936,PART I.,"Ices, _par exemple_; evening air,"
3937,PART I.,"Company, and this handsome square;"
3938,PART I.,And all the sweets in perfect plenty
3939,PART I.,Of the old _dolce far niente_.
3940,PART I.,"Music! Up, up; it isn’t fit"
3941,PART I.,With beggars here on steps to sit.
3942,PART I.,"Up, to the caffé! take a chair,"
3943,PART I.,And join the wiser idlers there.
3944,PART I.,And see that fellow singing yonder;
3945,PART I.,"Singing, ye gods, and dancing too—"
3946,PART I.,"Tooraloo, tooraloo, tooraloo, loo—"
3947,PART I.,"Fiddledi diddledi, diddle di di;"
3948,PART I.,"_Figaro sù, Figaro giù—_"
3949,PART I.,"_Figaro quà, Figaro là_!"
3950,PART I.,"How he likes doing it—Ha, ha!"
3951,PART I.,
3952,PART I.,"_Di._ While these do what? Ah, heaven! too true, at Venice"
3953,PART I.,Christ is not risen either.
3954,PART I.,
3955,PART I.,
3956,PART I.,SCENE II.—_The Public Garden._
3957,PART I.,
3958,PART I.,"_Di._ Assuredly, a lively scene!"
3959,PART I.,"And, ah, how pleasant something green!"
3960,PART I.,With circling heavens one perfect rose
3961,PART I.,"Each smoother patch of water glows,"
3962,PART I.,"Hence to where, o’er the full tide’s face,"
3963,PART I.,"We see the Palace and the Place,"
3964,PART I.,"And the white dome; beauteous, but hot."
3965,PART I.,Where in the meantime is the spot—
3966,PART I.,"My favourite—where by masses blue,"
3967,PART I.,"And white cloud-folds, I follow true"
3968,PART I.,"The great Alps, rounding grandly o’er,"
3969,PART I.,"Huge arc, to the Dalmatian shore?"
3970,PART I.,
3971,PART I.,"_Sp._ This rather stupid place, to-day,"
3972,PART I.,"It’s true, is most extremely gay;"
3973,PART I.,And rightly—the Assunzione
3974,PART I.,Was always a _gran’ funzione_.
3975,PART I.,
3976,PART I.,_Di._ What is this persecuting voice that haunts me?
3977,PART I.,What? whence? of whom? How am I to detect?
3978,PART I.,"Myself or not myself? My own bad thoughts,"
3979,PART I.,"Or some external agency at work,"
3980,PART I.,To lead me who knows whither?
3981,PART I.,
3982,PART I.,_Sp._                         Eh?
3983,PART I.,We’re certainly in luck to-day:
3984,PART I.,What crowds of boats before us plying—
3985,PART I.,"Gay parties, singing, shouting, crying—"
3986,PART I.,Saluting others past them flying!
3987,PART I.,What numbers at the causeway lying!
3988,PART I.,"What lots of pretty girls, too, hieing"
3989,PART I.,"Hither and thither—coming, going,"
3990,PART I.,And with what satisfaction showing
3991,PART I.,"Their dark exuberance of hair,"
3992,PART I.,"Black eyes, rich tints, and sundry graces"
3993,PART I.,Of classic pure Italian faces!
3994,PART I.,
3995,PART I.,"_Di._                          Ah me, me!"
3996,PART I.,"Clear stars above, thou roseate westward sky,"
3997,PART I.,Take up my being into yours; assume
3998,PART I.,My sense to know you only; steep my brain
3999,PART I.,"In your essential purity, or, great Alps,"
4000,PART I.,That wrapping round your heads in solemn clouds
4001,PART I.,"Seem sternly to sweep past our vanities,"
4002,PART I.,"Lead me with you—take me away, preserve me!"
4003,PART I.,
4004,PART I.,"O moon and stars, forgive! and thou, clear heaven,"
4005,PART I.,"Look pureness back into me. Oh, great God!"
4006,PART I.,"Why, why, in wisdom and in grace’s name,"
4007,PART I.,"And in the name of saints and saintly thoughts,"
4008,PART I.,"Of mothers, and of sisters, and chaste wives,"
4009,PART I.,"And angel woman-faces we have seen,"
4010,PART I.,"And angel woman-spirits we have guessed,"
4011,PART I.,"And innocent sweet children, and pure love,"
4012,PART I.,Why did I ever one brief moment’s space
4013,PART I.,But parley with this filthy Belial?
4014,PART I.,...Was it the fear
4015,PART I.,"Of being behind the world, which is the wicked?"
4016,PART I.,
4017,PART I.,
4018,PART I.,SCENE III.—_At the Hotel._
4019,PART I.,
4020,PART I.,"_Sp._                                           Come, then,"
4021,PART I.,And with my aid go into good society.
4022,PART I.,"Life little loves, ’tis true, this peevish piety;"
4023,PART I.,E’en they with whom it thinks to be securest—
4024,PART I.,"Your most religious, delicatest, purest—"
4025,PART I.,"Discern, and show as pious people can"
4026,PART I.,Their feeling that you are not quite a man.
4027,PART I.,"Still the thing has its place; and with sagacity,"
4028,PART I.,Much might be done by one of your capacity.
4029,PART I.,A virtuous attachment formed judiciously
4030,PART I.,"Would come, one sees, uncommonly propitiously:"
4031,PART I.,"Turn you but your affections the right way,"
4032,PART I.,And what mayn’t happen none of us can say;
4033,PART I.,"For in despite of devils and of mothers,"
4034,PART I.,"Your good young men make catches, too, like others."
4035,PART I.,
4036,PART I.,_Di._ To herd with people that one owns no care for;
4037,PART I.,Friend it with strangers that one sees but once;
4038,PART I.,To drain the heart with endless complaisance;
4039,PART I.,"To warp the unfinished diction on the lip,"
4040,PART I.,And twist one’s mouth to counterfeit; enforce
4041,PART I.,Reluctant looks to falsehood; base-alloy
4042,PART I.,The ingenuous golden frankness of the past;
4043,PART I.,"To calculate and plot; be rough and smooth,"
4044,PART I.,"Forward and silent, deferential, cool,"
4045,PART I.,"Not by one’s humour, which is the safe truth,"
4046,PART I.,But on consideration.
4047,PART I.,
4048,PART I.,"_Sp._                 That is, act"
4049,PART I.,On a dispassionate judgment of the fact;
4050,PART I.,"Look all the data fairly in the face,"
4051,PART I.,And rule your judgment simply by the case.
4052,PART I.,
4053,PART I.,"_Di._ On vile consideration. At the best,"
4054,PART I.,With pallid hotbed courtesies to forestall
4055,PART I.,"The green and vernal spontaneity,"
4056,PART I.,And waste the priceless moments of the man
4057,PART I.,In regulating manner. Whether these things
4058,PART I.,"Be right, I do not know: I only know ’tis"
4059,PART I.,"To lose one’s youth too early. Oh, not yet—"
4060,PART I.,Not yet I make the sacrifice.
4061,PART I.,
4062,PART I.,_Sp._                         _Du tout!_
4063,PART I.,To give up nature’s just what would not do.
4064,PART I.,"By all means keep your sweet ingenuous graces,"
4065,PART I.,And use them at the proper times and places.
4066,PART I.,"For work, for play, for business, talk and love,"
4067,PART I.,"I own as wisdom truly from above,"
4068,PART I.,That scripture of the serpent and the dove;
4069,PART I.,Nor’s aught so perfect for the world’s affairs
4070,PART I.,As the old parable of wheat and tares;
4071,PART I.,What we all love is good touched up with evil—
4072,PART I.,Religion’s self must have a spice of devil.
4073,PART I.,
4074,PART I.,"_Di._                 Let it be enough,"
4075,PART I.,"That in our needful mixture with the world,"
4076,PART I.,"On each new morning with the rising sun,"
4077,PART I.,"Our rising heart, fresh from the seas of sleep,"
4078,PART I.,Scarce o’er the level lifts his purer orb
4079,PART I.,Ere lost and sullied with polluting smoke—
4080,PART I.,"A noon-day coppery disk. Lo, scarce come forth,"
4081,PART I.,"Some vagrant miscreant meets, and with a look"
4082,PART I.,"Transmutes me his, and for a whole sick day"
4083,PART I.,Lepers me.
4084,PART I.,
4085,PART I.,"_Sp._      Just the one thing, I assure you,"
4086,PART I.,From which good company can’t but secure you.
4087,PART I.,"About the individual’s not so clear,"
4088,PART I.,But who can doubt the general atmosphere?
4089,PART I.,
4090,PART I.,"_Di._ Ay truly, who at first? but in a while——"
4091,PART I.,
4092,PART I.,"_Sp._ O dear, this o’er-discernment makes me smile."
4093,PART I.,You don’t pretend to tell me you can see
4094,PART I.,Without one touch of melting sympathy
4095,PART I.,"Those lovely, stately flowers that fill with bloom"
4096,PART I.,"The brilliant season’s gay parterre-like room,"
4097,PART I.,Moving serene yet swiftly through the dances;
4098,PART I.,"Those graceful forms and perfect countenances,"
4099,PART I.,Whose every fold and line in all their dresses
4100,PART I.,Something refined and exquisite expresses.
4101,PART I.,"To see them smile and hear them talk so sweetly,"
4102,PART I.,In me destroys all lower thoughts completely;
4103,PART I.,"I really seem, without exaggeration,"
4104,PART I.,To experience the true regeneration.
4105,PART I.,"One’s own dress, too—one’s manner, what one’s doing"
4106,PART I.,"And saying, all assist to one’s renewing."
4107,PART I.,"I love to see, in these their fitting places,"
4108,PART I.,"The bows, the forms, and all you call grimaces."
4109,PART I.,"I heartily could wish we’d kept some more of them,"
4110,PART I.,However much we talk about the bore of them.
4111,PART I.,"Fact is, your awkward parvenus are shy at it,"
4112,PART I.,Afraid to look like waiters if they try at it.
4113,PART I.,’Tis sad to what democracy is leading—
4114,PART I.,Give me your Eighteenth Century for high breeding.
4115,PART I.,"Though I can put up gladly with the present,"
4116,PART I.,And quite can think our modern parties pleasant.
4117,PART I.,One shouldn’t analyse the thing too nearly:
4118,PART I.,The main effect is admirable clearly.
4119,PART I.,"‘Good manners,’ said our great-aunts, ‘next to piety:’"
4120,PART I.,"And so my friend, hurrah for good society!"
4121,PART I.,
4122,PART I.,
4123,PART I.,SCENE IV.—_On the Piazza._
4124,PART I.,
4125,PART I.,_Sp._ Insulted! by the living Lord!
4126,PART I.,He laid his hand upon his sword.
4127,PART I.,"‘_Fort_,’ did he say? a German brute,"
4128,PART I.,With neither heart nor brains to shoot.
4129,PART I.,
4130,PART I.,"_Di._ What does he mean? he’s wrong, I had done nothing."
4131,PART I.,"’Twas a mistake—more his, I am sure, than mine."
4132,PART I.,"He is quite wrong—I feel it. Come, let us go."
4133,PART I.,
4134,PART I.,"_Sp._ Go up to him!—you must, that’s flat."
4135,PART I.,Be threatened by a beast like that!
4136,PART I.,
4137,PART I.,_Di._ He’s violent: what can I do against him?
4138,PART I.,I neither wish to be killed nor to kill:
4139,PART I.,"What’s more, I never yet have touched a sword,"
4140,PART I.,"Nor fired, but twice, a pistol in my life."
4141,PART I.,
4142,PART I.,"_Sp._ Oh, never mind, ’twon’t come to fighting—"
4143,PART I.,Only some verbal small requiting;
4144,PART I.,Or give your card—we’ll do’t by writing.
4145,PART I.,He’ll not stick to it. Soldiers too
4146,PART I.,"Are cowards, just like me or you."
4147,PART I.,What! not a single word to throw at
4148,PART I.,This snarling dog of a d——d Croat?
4149,PART I.,
4150,PART I.,_Di._ My heavens! why should I care? he does not hurt me.
4151,PART I.,"If he is wrong, it is the worst for him."
4152,PART I.,I certainly did nothing: I shall go.
4153,PART I.,
4154,PART I.,"_Sp._ Did nothing! I should think not; no,"
4155,PART I.,"Nor ever will, I dare be sworn!"
4156,PART I.,"But, O my friend, well-bred, well-born—"
4157,PART I.,You to behave so in these quarrels
4158,PART I.,Makes me half doubtful of your morals!
4159,PART I.,"...It were all one,"
4160,PART I.,"You had been some shopkeeper’s son,"
4161,PART I.,Whose childhood ne’er was shown aught better
4162,PART I.,Than bills of creditor and debtor.
4163,PART I.,
4164,PART I.,"_Di._ By heaven, it falls from off me like the rain"
4165,PART I.,From the oil-coat. I seem in spirit to see
4166,PART I.,How he and I at some great day shall meet
4167,PART I.,Before some awful judgment-seat of truth;
4168,PART I.,And I could deem that I behold him there
4169,PART I.,"Come praying for the pardon I give now,"
4170,PART I.,"Did I not think these matters too, too small"
4171,PART I.,For any record on the leaves of time.
4172,PART I.,"O thou great Watcher of this noisy world,"
4173,PART I.,What are they in Thy sight? or what in his
4174,PART I.,Who finds some end of action in his life?
4175,PART I.,What e’en in his whose sole permitted course
4176,PART I.,"Is to pursue his peaceful byway walk,"
4177,PART I.,"And live his brief life purely in Thy sight,"
4178,PART I.,And righteously towards his brother-men?
4179,PART I.,
4180,PART I.,"_Sp._ And whether, so you’re just and fair,"
4181,PART I.,"Other folks are so, you don’t care;"
4182,PART I.,You who profess more love than others
4183,PART I.,For your poor sinful human brothers.
4184,PART I.,
4185,PART I.,_Di._ For grosser evils their gross remedies
4186,PART I.,The laws afford us; let us be content;
4187,PART I.,"For finer wounds the law would, if it could,"
4188,PART I.,"Find medicine too; it cannot, let us bear;"
4189,PART I.,For sufferance is the badge of all men’s tribes.
4190,PART I.,
4191,PART I.,"_Sp._ Because we can’t do all we would,"
4192,PART I.,"Does it follow, to do nothing’s good?"
4193,PART I.,No way to help the law’s rough sense
4194,PART I.,By equities of self-defence?
4195,PART I.,"Well, for yourself it may be nice"
4196,PART I.,To serve vulgarity and vice:
4197,PART I.,"Must sisters, too, and wives and mothers,"
4198,PART I.,Fare like their patient sons and brothers?
4199,PART I.,
4200,PART I.,"_Di._ He that loves sister, mother, more than me——"
4201,PART I.,
4202,PART I.,_Sp._ But the injustice—the gross wrong!
4203,PART I.,To whom on earth does it belong
4204,PART I.,"If not to you, to whom ’twas done,"
4205,PART I.,"Who saw it plain as any sun,"
4206,PART I.,To make the base and foul offender
4207,PART I.,"Confess, and satisfaction render?"
4208,PART I.,At least before the termination of it
4209,PART I.,Prove your own lofty reprobation of it.
4210,PART I.,"Though gentleness, I know, was born in you,"
4211,PART I.,Surely you have a little scorn in you?
4212,PART I.,
4213,PART I.,_Di._ Heaven! to pollute one’s fingers to pick up
4214,PART I.,The fallen coin of honour from the dirt—
4215,PART I.,"Pure silver though it be, let it rather lie!"
4216,PART I.,"To take up any offence, where’t may be said"
4217,PART I.,"That temper, vanity—I know not what—"
4218,PART I.,Had led me on!
4219,PART I.,To have so much as e’en half felt of one
4220,PART I.,That ever one was angered for oneself!
4221,PART I.,"Beyond suspicion Cæsar’s wife should be,"
4222,PART I.,Beyond suspicion this bright honour shall.
4223,PART I.,"Did he say scorn? I have some scorn, thank God."
4224,PART I.,
4225,PART I.,"_Sp._ Certainly. Only if it’s so,"
4226,PART I.,"Let us leave Italy, and go"
4227,PART I.,"Post haste, to attend—you’re ripe and rank for’t—"
4228,PART I.,The great peace-meeting up at Frankfort.
4229,PART I.,"Joy to the Croat! Take our lives,"
4230,PART I.,"Sweet friends, and please respect our wives;"
4231,PART I.,"Joy to the Croat! Some fine day,"
4232,PART I.,"He’ll see the error of his way,"
4233,PART I.,"No doubt, and will repent and pray."
4234,PART I.,"At any rate he’ll open his eyes,"
4235,PART I.,"If not before, at the Last Assize."
4236,PART I.,"Not, if I rightly understood you,"
4237,PART I.,"That even then you’d punish, would you?"
4238,PART I.,"Nay, let the hapless soul go free—"
4239,PART I.,"Mere murder, crime, or robbery,"
4240,PART I.,"In whate’er station, age, or sex,"
4241,PART I.,Your sacred spirit scarce can vex:
4242,PART I.,_De minimis non curat lex_.
4243,PART I.,To the Peace Congress! ring the bell!
4244,PART I.,Horses to Frankfort and to ——!
4245,PART I.,
4246,PART I.,_Di._ I am not quite in union with myself
4247,PART I.,On this strange matter. I must needs confess
4248,PART I.,"Instinct turns instinct out, and thought"
4249,PART I.,Wheels round on thought. To bleed for others’ wrongs
4250,PART I.,"In vindication of a cause, to draw"
4251,PART I.,"The sword of the Lord and Gideon—oh, that seems"
4252,PART I.,The flower and top of life! But fight because
4253,PART I.,Some poor misconstruing trifler haps to say
4254,PART I.,"I lie, when I do not lie,"
4255,PART I.,Why should I? Call you this a cause? I can’t.
4256,PART I.,"Oh, he is wrong, no doubt; he misbehaves—"
4257,PART I.,But is it worth so much as speaking loud?
4258,PART I.,And things so merely personal to myself
4259,PART I.,Of all earth’s things do least affect myself.
4260,PART I.,
4261,PART I.,_Sp._ Sweet eloquence! at next May Meeting
4262,PART I.,How it would tell in the repeating!
4263,PART I.,"I recognise, and kiss the rod—"
4264,PART I.,The methodistic ‘voice of God;’
4265,PART I.,"I catch contrite that angel whine,"
4266,PART I.,"That snuffle human, yet divine."
4267,PART I.,
4268,PART I.,_Di._ It may be I am somewhat of a poltroon;
4269,PART I.,I never fought at school; whether it be
4270,PART I.,"Some native poorness in my spirit’s blood,"
4271,PART I.,Or that the holy doctrine of our faith
4272,PART I.,In too exclusive fervency possessed
4273,PART I.,"My heart with feelings, with ideas my brain."
4274,PART I.,
4275,PART I.,_Sp._ Yes; you would argue that it goes
4276,PART I.,"Against the Bible, I suppose;"
4277,PART I.,"But our revered religion—yes,"
4278,PART I.,"Our common faith—seems, I confess,"
4279,PART I.,On these points to propose to address
4280,PART I.,The people more than you or me—
4281,PART I.,At best the vulgar bourgeoisie.
4282,PART I.,"The sacred writers don’t keep count,"
4283,PART I.,But still the Sermon on the Mount
4284,PART I.,"Must have been spoken, by what’s stated,"
4285,PART I.,To hearers by the thousands rated.
4286,PART I.,I cuff some fellow; mild and meek
4287,PART I.,He should turn round the other cheek.
4288,PART I.,For him it may be right and good;
4289,PART I.,We are not all of gentle blood
4290,PART I.,"Really, or as such understood."
4291,PART I.,
4292,PART I.,"_Di._ There are two kindreds upon earth, I know—"
4293,PART I.,"The oppressors and the oppressed. But as for me,"
4294,PART I.,"If I must choose to inflict wrong, or accept,"
4295,PART I.,"May my last end, and life too, be with these."
4296,PART I.,"Yes; whatsoe’er the reason, want of blood,"
4297,PART I.,"Lymphatic humours, or my childhood’s faith,"
4298,PART I.,"So is the thing, and be it well or ill,"
4299,PART I.,"I have no choice. I am a man of peace,"
4300,PART I.,And the old Adam of the gentleman
4301,PART I.,Dares seldom in my bosom stir against
4302,PART I.,The mild plebeian Christian seated there.
4303,PART I.,
4304,PART I.,"_Sp._ Forgive me, if I name my doubt,"
4305,PART I.,Whether you know ‘_fort_’ means ‘_get out_.’
4306,PART I.,
4307,PART I.,
4308,PART I.,SCENE V.—_The Lido._
4309,PART I.,
4310,PART I.,_Sp._ What now? the Lido shall it be?
4311,PART I.,That none may say we didn’t see
4312,PART I.,"The ground which Byron used to ride on,"
4313,PART I.,And do I don’t know what beside on.
4314,PART I.,"Ho, barca! here! and this light gale"
4315,PART I.,Will let us run it with a sail.
4316,PART I.,
4317,PART I.,_Di._ I dreamt a dream: till morning light
4318,PART I.,"A bell rang in my head all night,"
4319,PART I.,"Tinkling and tinkling first, and then"
4320,PART I.,"Tolling and tinkling, tolling again,"
4321,PART I.,"So brisk and gay, and then so slow!"
4322,PART I.,O joy and terror! mirth and woe!
4323,PART I.,"Ting, ting, there is no God; ting, ting,—"
4324,PART I.,"Dong, there is no God; dong,"
4325,PART I.,"There is no God; dong, dong."
4326,PART I.,
4327,PART I.,"Ting, ting, there is no God; ting, ting."
4328,PART I.,"Come, dance and play, and merrily sing,"
4329,PART I.,"Staid Englishman, who toil and slave"
4330,PART I.,"From your first childhood to your grave,"
4331,PART I.,And seldom spend and always save—
4332,PART I.,And do your duty all your life
4333,PART I.,By your young family and wife;
4334,PART I.,"Come, be’t not said you ne’er had known"
4335,PART I.,What earth can furnish you alone.
4336,PART I.,"The Italian, Frenchman, German even,"
4337,PART I.,Have given up all thoughts of heaven:
4338,PART I.,"And you still linger—oh, you fool!—"
4339,PART I.,Because of what you learnt at school.
4340,PART I.,"You should have gone at least to college,"
4341,PART I.,And got a little ampler knowledge.
4342,PART I.,"Ah well, and yet—dong, dong, dong:"
4343,PART I.,"Do as you like, as now you do;"
4344,PART I.,"If work’s a cheat, so’s pleasure too."
4345,PART I.,And nothing’s new and nothing’s true;
4346,PART I.,"Dong, there is no God; dong."
4347,PART I.,
4348,PART I.,"O, in our nook unknown, unseen,"
4349,PART I.,We’ll hold our fancy like a screen
4350,PART I.,Us and the dreadful fact between;
4351,PART I.,"And it shall yet be long—ay, long—"
4352,PART I.,The quiet notes of our low song
4353,PART I.,"Shall keep us from that sad dong, dong.—"
4354,PART I.,"Hark, hark, hark! O voice of fear,"
4355,PART I.,"It reaches us here, even here!"
4356,PART I.,"Dong, there is no God; dong."
4357,PART I.,
4358,PART I.,"Ring ding, ring ding, tara, tara,"
4359,PART I.,"To battle, to battle—haste, haste—"
4360,PART I.,"To battle, to battle—aha, aha!"
4361,PART I.,"On, on, to the conqueror’s feast,"
4362,PART I.,"From east to west, and south and north,"
4363,PART I.,"Ye men of valour and of worth,"
4364,PART I.,"Ye mighty men of arms come forth,"
4365,PART I.,"And work your will, for that is just;"
4366,PART I.,"And in your impulse put your trust,"
4367,PART I.,Beneath your feet the fools are dust.
4368,PART I.,"Alas, alas! O grief and wrong,"
4369,PART I.,"The good are weak, the wicked strong;"
4370,PART I.,"And O my God, how long, how long!"
4371,PART I.,"Dong, there is no God; dong."
4372,PART I.,
4373,PART I.,"Ring, ting; to bow before the strong,"
4374,PART I.,There is a rapture too in this;
4375,PART I.,"Work for thy master, work, thou slave—"
4376,PART I.,"He is not merciful, but brave."
4377,PART I.,"Be’t joy to serve, who free and proud"
4378,PART I.,Scorns thee and all the ignoble crowd;
4379,PART I.,"Take that, ’tis all thou art allowed,"
4380,PART I.,Except the snaky hope that they
4381,PART I.,May sometime serve who rule to-day.
4382,PART I.,"When, by hell-demons, shan’t they pay?"
4383,PART I.,"O wickedness, O shame and grief,"
4384,PART I.,"And heavy load, and no relief!"
4385,PART I.,"O God, O God! and which is worst,"
4386,PART I.,"To be the curser or the curst,"
4387,PART I.,The victim or the murderer? Dong.
4388,PART I.,"Dong, there is no God; dong."
4389,PART I.,"Ring ding, ring ding, tara, tara,"
4390,PART I.,"Away, and hush that preaching—fagh!"
4391,PART I.,"Ye vulgar dreamers about peace,"
4392,PART I.,"Who offer noblest hearts, to heal"
4393,PART I.,"The tenderest hurts honour can feel,"
4394,PART I.,Paid magistrates and the police!
4395,PART I.,"O peddling merchant-justice, go,"
4396,PART I.,Exacter rules than yours we know;
4397,PART I.,"Resentment’s rule, and that high law"
4398,PART I.,Of whoso best the sword can draw.
4399,PART I.,"Ah well, and yet—dong, dong, dong."
4400,PART I.,"Go on, my friends, as now you do;"
4401,PART I.,"Lawyers are villains, soldiers too;"
4402,PART I.,And nothing’s new and nothing’s true.
4403,PART I.,"Dong, there is no God; dong."
4404,PART I.,
4405,PART I.,"I had a dream, from eve to light"
4406,PART I.,A bell went sounding all the night.
4407,PART I.,"Gay mirth, black woe, thin joys, huge pain:"
4408,PART I.,"I tried to stop it, but in vain."
4409,PART I.,"It ran right on, and never broke;"
4410,PART I.,Only when day began to stream
4411,PART I.,"Through the white curtains to my bed,"
4412,PART I.,And like an angel at my head
4413,PART I.,"Light stood and touched me—I awoke,"
4414,PART I.,"And looked, and said, ‘It is a dream.’"
4415,PART I.,
4416,PART I.,"_Sp._ Ah! not so bad. You’ve read, I see,"
4417,PART I.,"Your Béranger, and thought of me."
4418,PART I.,But really you owe some apology
4419,PART I.,For harping thus upon theology.
4420,PART I.,"I’m not a judge, I own; in short,"
4421,PART I.,Religion may not be my forte.
4422,PART I.,"The Church of England I belong to,"
4423,PART I.,And think Dissenters not far wrong too;
4424,PART I.,They’re vulgar dogs; but for his _creed_
4425,PART I.,I hold that no man will be d——d.
4426,PART I.,"But come and listen in your turn,"
4427,PART I.,And you shall hear and mark and learn.
4428,PART I.,
4429,PART I.,"‘There is no God,’ the wicked saith,"
4430,PART I.,"‘And truly it’s a blessing,"
4431,PART I.,For what He might have done with us
4432,PART I.,It’s better only guessing.’
4433,PART I.,
4434,PART I.,"‘There is no God,’ a youngster thinks,"
4435,PART I.,"‘Or really, if there may be,"
4436,PART I.,He surely didn’t mean a man
4437,PART I.,Always to be a baby.’
4438,PART I.,
4439,PART I.,"‘There is no God, or if there is,’"
4440,PART I.,"The tradesman thinks, ‘’twere funny"
4441,PART I.,If He should take it ill in me
4442,PART I.,To make a little money.’
4443,PART I.,
4444,PART I.,"‘Whether there be,’ the rich man says,"
4445,PART I.,"‘It matters very little,"
4446,PART I.,"For I and mine, thank somebody,"
4447,PART I.,Are not in want of victual.’
4448,PART I.,
4449,PART I.,"Some others, also, to themselves,"
4450,PART I.,"Who scarce so much as doubt it,"
4451,PART I.,"Think there is none, when they are well,"
4452,PART I.,And do not think about it.
4453,PART I.,
4454,PART I.,But country folks who live beneath
4455,PART I.,The shadow of the steeple;
4456,PART I.,"The parson and the parson’s wife,"
4457,PART I.,And mostly married people;
4458,PART I.,
4459,PART I.,"Youths green and happy in first love,"
4460,PART I.,So thankful for illusion;
4461,PART I.,And men caught out in what the world
4462,PART I.,"Calls guilt, in first confusion;"
4463,PART I.,
4464,PART I.,"And almost every one when age,"
4465,PART I.,"Disease, or sorrows strike him,"
4466,PART I.,"Inclines to think there is a God,"
4467,PART I.,Or something very like Him.
4468,PART I.,
4469,PART I.,"But _eccoci_! with our _barchetta_,"
4470,PART I.,Here at the Sant’ Elisabetta.
4471,PART I.,
4472,PART I.,"_Di._ Vineyards and maize, that’s pleasant for sore eyes."
4473,PART I.,
4474,PART I.,"_Sp._ And on the island’s other side,"
4475,PART I.,The place where Murray’s faithful Guide
4476,PART I.,Informs us Byron used to ride.
4477,PART I.,
4478,PART I.,"_Di._ The trellised vines! enchanting! Sandhills, ho!"
4479,PART I.,"The sea, at last the sea—the real broad sea—"
4480,PART I.,Beautiful! and a glorious breeze upon it.
4481,PART I.,
4482,PART I.,_Sp._ Look back; one catches at this station
4483,PART I.,Lagoon and sea in combination.
4484,PART I.,
4485,PART I.,"_Di._ On her still lake the city sits,"
4486,PART I.,"Where bark and boat around her flits,"
4487,PART I.,"Nor dreams, her soft siesta taking,"
4488,PART I.,Of Adriatic billows breaking.
4489,PART I.,I do; I see and hear them. Come! to the sea!
4490,PART I.,"Oh, a grand surge! we’ll bathe; quick, quick!—undress!"
4491,PART I.,"Quick, quick!—in, in!"
4492,PART I.,We’ll take the crested billows by their backs
4493,PART I.,"And shake them. Quick! in, in!"
4494,PART I.,
4495,PART I.,And I will taste again the old joy
4496,PART I.,I gloried in so when a boy;
4497,PART I.,"Aha! come, come—great waters, roll!"
4498,PART I.,"Accept me, take me, body and soul!"
4499,PART I.,"That’s done me good. It grieves me though,"
4500,PART I.,I never came here long ago.
4501,PART I.,
4502,PART I.,"_Sp._ Pleasant, perhaps; however, no offence,"
4503,PART I.,Animal spirits are not common sense;
4504,PART I.,"They’re good enough as an assistance,"
4505,PART I.,But in themselves a poor existence.
4506,PART I.,"But you, with this one bathe, no doubt,"
4507,PART I.,Have solved all questions out and out.
4508,PART I.,
4509,PART I.,
4510,PART II.,PART II.
4511,PART II.,
4512,PART II.,
4513,PART II.,SCENE I.—_The interior Arcade of the Doge’s Palace._
4514,PART II.,
4515,PART II.,"_Sp._ Thunder and rain! O dear, O dear!"
4516,PART II.,"But see, a noble shelter here,"
4517,PART II.,This grand arcade where our Venetian
4518,PART II.,Has formed of Gothic and of Grecian
4519,PART II.,"A combination strange, but striking,"
4520,PART II.,And singularly to my liking!
4521,PART II.,"Let moderns reap where ancients sowed,"
4522,PART II.,I at least make it my abode.
4523,PART II.,And now let’s hear your famous Ode:
4524,PART II.,‘Through the great sinful’—how did it go on?
4525,PART II.,For principles of Art and so on
4526,PART II.,"I care perhaps about three curses,"
4527,PART II.,But hold myself a judge of verses.
4528,PART II.,
4529,PART II.,_Di._ ‘My brain was lightened when my tongue
4530,PART II.,"had said, “Christ is not risen.”’"
4531,PART II.,
4532,PART II.,*       *       *       *       *
4533,PART II.,
4534,PART II.,"_Sp._ Well, now it’s anything but clear"
4535,PART II.,What is the tone that’s taken here:
4536,PART II.,What is your logic? what’s your theology?
4537,PART II.,"Is it, or is it not, neology?"
4538,PART II.,"That’s a great fault; you’re this and that,"
4539,PART II.,"And here and there, and nothing flat;"
4540,PART II.,"Yet writing’s golden word what is it,"
4541,PART II.,But the three syllables ‘explicit’?
4542,PART II.,"Say, if you cannot help it, less,"
4543,PART II.,"But what you do put, put express."
4544,PART II.,I fear that rule won’t meet your feeling:
4545,PART II.,"You think half showing, half concealing,"
4546,PART II.,Is God’s own method of revealing.
4547,PART II.,
4548,PART II.,_Di._ To please my own poor mind! to find repose;
4549,PART II.,To physic the sick soul; to furnish vent
4550,PART II.,To diseased humours in the moral frame!
4551,PART II.,
4552,PART II.,"_Sp._ A sort of seton, I suppose,"
4553,PART II.,A moral bleeding at the nose:
4554,PART II.,"H’m;—and the tone too after all,"
4555,PART II.,Something of the ironical?
4556,PART II.,"Sarcastic, say; or were it fitter"
4557,PART II.,To style it the religious bitter?
4558,PART II.,
4559,PART II.,"_Di._ Interpret it I cannot, I but wrote it."
4560,PART II.,
4561,PART II.,"_Sp._ Perhaps; but none that read can doubt it,"
4562,PART II.,There is a strong Strauss-smell about it.
4563,PART II.,Heavens! at your years your time to fritter
4564,PART II.,Upon a critical hair-splitter!
4565,PART II.,Take larger views (and quit your Germans)
4566,PART II.,From the Analogy and sermons;
4567,PART II.,I fancied—you must doubtless know—
4568,PART II.,"Butler had proved an age ago,"
4569,PART II.,That in religious as profane things
4570,PART II.,’Twas useless trying to explain things;
4571,PART II.,"Men’s business-wits, the only sane things,"
4572,PART II.,These and compliance are the main things.
4573,PART II.,"God, Revelation, and the rest of it,"
4574,PART II.,"Bad at the best, we make the best of it."
4575,PART II.,"Like a good subject and wise man,"
4576,PART II.,Believe whatever things you can.
4577,PART II.,"Take your religion as ’twas found you,"
4578,PART II.,"And say no more of it, confound you!"
4579,PART II.,And now I think the rain has ended;
4580,PART II.,"And the less said, the soonest mended."
4581,PART II.,
4582,PART II.,
4583,PART II.,SCENE II.—_In a Gondola._
4584,PART II.,
4585,PART II.,_Sp._ _Per ora._ To the Grand Canal.
4586,PART II.,Afterwards e’en as fancy shall.
4587,PART II.,
4588,PART II.,"_Di._ Afloat; we move. Delicious! Ah,"
4589,PART II.,What else is like the gondola?
4590,PART II.,This level floor of liquid glass
4591,PART II.,Begins beneath us swift to pass.
4592,PART II.,It goes as though it went alone
4593,PART II.,By some impulsion of its own.
4594,PART II.,"(How light it moves, how softly! Ah,"
4595,PART II.,Were all things like the gondola!)
4596,PART II.,
4597,PART II.,"How light it moves, how softly! Ah,"
4598,PART II.,"Could life, as does our gondola,"
4599,PART II.,"Unvexed with quarrels, aims, and cares,"
4600,PART II.,"And moral duties and affairs,"
4601,PART II.,"Unswaying, noiseless, swift and strong,"
4602,PART II.,For ever thus—thus glide along!
4603,PART II.,"(How light we move, how softly! Ah,"
4604,PART II.,Were life but as the gondola!)
4605,PART II.,
4606,PART II.,With no more motion than should bear
4607,PART II.,A freshness to the languid air;
4608,PART II.,With no more effort than exprest
4609,PART II.,"The need and naturalness of rest,"
4610,PART II.,Which we beneath a grateful shade
4611,PART II.,Should take on peaceful pillows laid!
4612,PART II.,"(How light we move, how softly! Ah,"
4613,PART II.,Were life but as the gondola!)
4614,PART II.,
4615,PART II.,In one unbroken passage borne
4616,PART II.,"To closing night from opening morn,"
4617,PART II.,Uplift at whiles slow eyes to mark
4618,PART II.,"Some palace front, some passing bark;"
4619,PART II.,"Through windows catch the varying shore,"
4620,PART II.,And hear the soft turns of the oar!
4621,PART II.,"(How light we move, how softly! Ah,"
4622,PART II.,Were life but as the gondola!)
4623,PART II.,
4624,PART II.,"So live, nor need to call to mind"
4625,PART II.,Our slaving brother here behind!
4626,PART II.,
4627,PART II.,_Sp._ Pooh! Nature meant him for no better
4628,PART II.,Than our most humble menial debtor:
4629,PART II.,Who thanks us for his day’s employment
4630,PART II.,As we our purse for our enjoyment.
4631,PART II.,
4632,PART II.,_Di._ To make one’s fellow-man an instrument——
4633,PART II.,
4634,PART II.,_Sp._ Is just the thing that makes him most content.
4635,PART II.,
4636,PART II.,"_Di._   Our gaieties, our luxuries,"
4637,PART II.,"Our pleasures and our glee,"
4638,PART II.,"Mere insolence and wantonness,"
4639,PART II.,Alas! they feel to me.
4640,PART II.,
4641,PART II.,How shall I laugh and sing and dance?
4642,PART II.,"My very heart recoils,"
4643,PART II.,While here to give my mirth a chance
4644,PART II.,A hungry brother toils.
4645,PART II.,
4646,PART II.,The joy that does not spring from joy
4647,PART II.,"Which I in others see,"
4648,PART II.,"How can I venture to employ,"
4649,PART II.,Or find it joy for me?
4650,PART II.,
4651,PART II.,"_Sp._ Oh come, come, come! By Him that sent us here."
4652,PART II.,"Who’s to enjoy at all, pray let us hear?"
4653,PART II.,"You won’t; he can’t! Oh, no more fuss!"
4654,PART II.,"What’s it to him, or he to us?"
4655,PART II.,"Sing, sing away, be glad and gay,"
4656,PART II.,And don’t forget that we shall pay.
4657,PART II.,
4658,PART II.,"_Di._ Yes, it is beautiful ever, let foolish men rail at it never."
4659,PART II.,"Yes, it is beautiful truly, my brothers, I grant it you duly."
4660,PART II.,"Wise are ye others that choose it, and happy ye all that can use it."
4661,PART II.,"Life it is beautiful wholly, and could we eliminate only"
4662,PART II.,"This interfering, enslaving, o’ermastering demon of craving,"
4663,PART II.,"This wicked tempter inside us to ruin still eager to guide us,"
4664,PART II.,"Life were beatitude, action a possible pure satisfaction."
4665,PART II.,
4666,PART II.,"_Sp._ (Hexameters, by all that’s odious,"
4667,PART II.,Beshod with rhyme to run melodious!)
4668,PART II.,
4669,PART II.,_Di._ All as I go on my way I behold them consorting and coupling;
4670,PART II.,"Faithful it seemeth, and fond; very fond, very possibly faithful;"
4671,PART II.,All as I go on my way with a pleasure sincere and unmingled
4672,PART II.,"Life it is beautiful truly, my brothers, I grant it you duly,"
4673,PART II.,"But for perfection attaining is one method only, abstaining;"
4674,PART II.,"Let us abstain, for we should so, if only we thought that we could so."
4675,PART II.,
4676,PART II.,"_Sp._ Bravo, bravissimo! this time though"
4677,PART II.,You rather were run short for rhyme though;
4678,PART II.,Not that on that account your verse
4679,PART II.,Could be much better or much worse.
4680,PART II.,
4681,PART II.,"This world is very odd we see,"
4682,PART II.,We do not comprehend it;
4683,PART II.,"But in one fact we all agree,"
4684,PART II.,"God won’t, and we can’t mend it."
4685,PART II.,
4686,PART II.,"Being common sense, it can’t be sin"
4687,PART II.,To take it as I find it;
4688,PART II.,The pleasure to take pleasure in;
4689,PART II.,"The pain, try not to mind it."
4690,PART II.,
4691,PART II.,"_Di._ O let me love my love unto myself alone,"
4692,PART II.,And know my knowledge to the world unknown;
4693,PART II.,"No witness to the vision call,"
4694,PART II.,"Beholding, unbeheld of all;"
4695,PART II.,"And worship thee, with thee withdrawn, apart,"
4696,PART II.,"Whoe’er, whate’er thou art,"
4697,PART II.,Within the closest veil of mine own inmost heart
4698,PART II.,
4699,PART II.,"Better it were, thou sayest, to consent,"
4700,PART II.,"Feast while we may, and live ere life be spent;"
4701,PART II.,"Close up clear eyes, and call the unstable sure,"
4702,PART II.,"The unlovely lovely, and the filthy pure;"
4703,PART II.,"In self-belyings, self-deceivings roll,"
4704,PART II.,"And lose in Action, Passion, Talk, the soul."
4705,PART II.,
4706,PART II.,"Nay, better far to mark off thus much air,"
4707,PART II.,And call it heaven; place bliss and glory there;
4708,PART II.,"Fix perfect homes in the unsubstantial sky,"
4709,PART II.,"And say, what is not, will be by-and-by;"
4710,PART II.,What here exists not must exist elsewhere.
4711,PART II.,"But play no tricks upon thy soul, O man;"
4712,PART II.,"Let fact be fact, and life the thing it can."
4713,PART II.,
4714,PART II.,"_Sp._ To these remarks so sage and clerkly,"
4715,PART II.,"Worthy of Malebranche or Berkeley,"
4716,PART II.,I trust it won’t be deemed a sin
4717,PART II.,If I too answer ‘with a grin.’
4718,PART II.,
4719,PART II.,"These juicy meats, this flashing wine,"
4720,PART II.,May be an unreal mere appearance;
4721,PART II.,"Only—for my inside, in fine,"
4722,PART II.,They have a singular coherence.
4723,PART II.,
4724,PART II.,"Oh yes, my pensive youth, abstain;"
4725,PART II.,And any empty sick sensation.
4726,PART II.,"Remember, anything like pain"
4727,PART II.,Is only your imagination.
4728,PART II.,
4729,PART II.,"Trust me, I’ve read your German sage"
4730,PART II.,To far more purpose e’er than you did;
4731,PART II.,"You find it in his wisest page,"
4732,PART II.,Whom God deludes is well deluded.

4984,PART II.,"Yet what he wants, and what he fain would have,"
4985,PART II.,"Oh, I know all too surely; not in vain,"
4986,PART II.,"Although unnoticed, has he dogged my ear."
4987,PART II.,"Come, we’ll be definite, explicit, plain;"
4988,PART II.,"I can resist, I know; and ’twill be well"
4989,PART II.,"For colloquy to have used this manlier mood,"

5000,PART II.,"Shame on me! come! Shall I, my follower,"
5001,PART II.,"Should I conceive (not that at all I do,"
5002,PART II.,’Tis curiosity that prompts my speech)—
5003,PART II.,"But should I form, a thing to be supposed,"
5004,PART II.,"A wish to bargain for your merchandise,"
5005,PART II.,Say what were your demands? what were your terms!
5006,PART II.,What should I do? what should I cease to do?

5076,PART II.,"Religion, if indeed it be in vain"
5077,PART II.,To expect to find in this more modern time
5078,PART II.,"That which the old world styled, in old-world phrase"
5079,PART II.,Walking with God. It seems His newer will
5080,PART II.,"We should not think of Him at all, but trudge it,"
5081,PART II.,And of the world He has assigned us make
5082,PART II.,What best we can.
5083,PART II.,Then love: I scarce can think
5084,PART II.,That these be-maddening discords of the mind
5085,PART II.,"To pure melodious sequence could be changed,"
5086,PART II.,And all the vext conundrums of our life
5087,PART II.,Solved to all time by this old pastoral
5088,PART II.,Of a new Adam and a second Eve
5089,PART II.,Set in a garden which no serpent seeks.
5090,PART II.,And yet I hold heart can beat true to heart:
5091,PART II.,"And to hew down the tree which bears this fruit,"
5092,PART II.,"To do a thing which cuts me off from hope,"
5093,PART II.,"To falsify the movement of Love’s mind,"
5094,PART II.,To seat some alien trifler on the throne
5095,PART II.,A queen may come to claim—that were ill done.
5096,PART II.,What! to the close hand of the clutching Jew
5097,PART II.,Hand up that rich reversion! and for what?
5098,PART II.,"This would be hard, did I indeed believe"

5102,PART II.,"Exists, I will believe, but so, so rare,"
5103,PART II.,"So doubtful, so exceptional, hard to guess;"
5104,PART II.,"When guessed, so often counterfeit; in brief,"
5105,PART II.,A thing not possibly to be conceived
5106,PART II.,An item in the reckonings of the wise.
5107,PART II.,
5108,PART II.,"Action, that staggers me. For I had hoped,"
5109,PART II.,"’Midst weakness, indolence, frivolity,"
5110,PART II.,"Irresolution, still had hoped: and this"
5111,PART II.,Seems sacrificing hope. Better to wait:
5112,PART II.,"The wise men wait; it is the foolish haste,"
5113,PART II.,"And ere the scenes are in the slides would play,"
5114,PART II.,"And while the instruments are tuning, dance."
5115,PART II.,I see Napoleon on the heights intent
5116,PART II.,To arrest that one brief unit of loose time
5117,PART II.,"Which hands high Victory’s thread; his marshals fret,"
5118,PART II.,His soldiers clamour low: the very guns
5119,PART II.,Seem going off of themselves; the cannon strain
5120,PART II.,"Like hell-dogs in the leash. But he, he waits;"
5121,PART II.,And lesser chances and inferior hopes
5122,PART II.,Meantime go pouring past. Men gnash their teeth;
5123,PART II.,The very faithful have begun to doubt;
5124,PART II.,But they molest not the calm eye that seeks
5125,PART II.,’Midst all this huddling silver little worth
5126,PART II.,"The one thin piece that comes, pure gold; he waits."
5127,PART II.,"O me, when the great deed e’en now has broke"
5128,PART II.,"Like a man’s hand the horizon’s level line,"
5129,PART II.,So soon to fill the zenith with rich clouds;
5130,PART II.,"Oh, in this narrow interspace, this marge,"
5131,PART II.,"This list and selvage of a glorious time,"
5132,PART II.,To despair of the great and sell unto the mean!

5142,PART II.,"Like an unpractised spyer through a glass,"
5143,PART II.,"Still pointing to the blank, too high! And yet,"
5144,PART II.,In dead details to smother vital ends
5145,PART II.,Which would give life to them; in the deft trick
5146,PART II.,"Of prentice-handling to forget great art,"
5147,PART II.,To base mechanical adroitness yield
5148,PART II.,The Inspiration and the Hope a slave!
5149,PART II.,"Oh, and to blast that Innocence which, though"
5150,PART II.,"Here it may seem a dull unopening bud,"
5151,PART II.,May yet bloom freely in celestial clime!
5152,PART II.,
5153,PART II.,"Were it not better done, then, to keep off"
5154,PART II.,"And see, not share, the strife; stand out the waltz"
5155,PART II.,Which fools whirl dizzy in? Is it possible?
5156,PART II.,Contamination taints the idler first;
5157,PART II.,"And without base compliance, e’en that same"
5158,PART II.,"Which buys bold hearts free course, Earth lends not these"
5159,PART II.,Their pent and miserable standing-room.
5160,PART II.,"Life loves no lookers-on at his great game,"
5161,PART II.,And with boy’s malice still delights to turn
5162,PART II.,"The tide of sport upon the sitters-by,"
5163,PART II.,And set observers scampering with their notes.
5164,PART II.,"Oh, it is great to do and know not what,"
5165,PART II.,Nor let it e’er be known. The dashing stream
5166,PART II.,"Stays not to pick his steps among the rocks,"
5167,PART II.,Or let his water-breaks be chronicled.
5168,PART II.,"And though the hunter looks before he leap,"
5169,PART II.,’Tis instinct rather than a shaped-out thought
5170,PART II.,"That lifts him his bold way. Then, instinct, hail!"
5171,PART II.,"And farewell hesitation. If I stay,"
5172,PART II.,I am not innocent; nor if I go—
5173,PART II.,E’en should I fall—beyond redemption lost.
5174,PART II.,
5175,PART II.,"Ah, if I had a course like a full stream,"
5176,PART II.,"If life were as the field of chase! No, no;"
5177,PART II.,"The life of instinct has, it seems, gone by,"
5178,PART II.,And will not be forced back. And to live now
5179,PART II.,"I must sluice out myself into canals,"
5180,PART II.,And lose all force in ducts. The modern Hotspur
5181,PART II.,"Shrills not his trumpet of ‘To Horse, To Horse!’"
5182,PART II.,But consults columns in a Railway Guide;
5183,PART II.,A demigod of figures; an Achilles
5184,PART II.,Of computation;
5185,PART II.,"A verier Mercury, express come down"
5186,PART II.,To do the world with swift arithmetic.
5187,PART II.,"Well, one could bear with that, were the end ours,"
5188,PART II.,One’s choice and the correlative of the soul;
5189,PART II.,To drudge were then sweet service. But indeed
5190,PART II.,"The earth moves slowly, if it move at all,"
5191,PART II.,"And by the general, not the single force"
5192,PART II.,Of the linked members of the vast machine.
5193,PART II.,"In all these crowded rooms of industry,"
5194,PART II.,No individual soul has loftier leave
5195,PART II.,Than fiddling with a piston or a valve.
5196,PART II.,"Well, one could bear that also: one would drudge"
5197,PART II.,"And do one’s petty part, and be content"
5198,PART II.,"In base manipulation, solaced still"
5199,PART II.,"By thinking of the leagued fraternity,"
5200,PART II.,"And of co-operation, and the effect"
5201,PART II.,"Of the great engine. If indeed it work,"
5202,PART II.,And is not a mere treadmill! which it may be.
5203,PART II.,Who can confirm it is not? We ask action.
5204,PART II.,And dream of arms and conflict; and string up
5205,PART II.,All self-devotion’s muscles; and are set
5206,PART II.,To fold up papers. To what end? we know not.
5207,PART II.,Other folks do so; it is always done;
5208,PART II.,"And it perhaps is right. And we are paid for it,"
5209,PART II.,For nothing else we can be. He that eats
5210,PART II.,Must serve; and serve as other servants do:
5211,PART II.,And don the lacquey’s livery of the house.
5212,PART II.,"Oh, could I shoot my thought up to the sky,"
5213,PART II.,"A column of pure shape, for all to observe!"
5214,PART II.,"But I must slave, a meagre coral-worm,"
5215,PART II.,To build beneath the tide with excrement
5216,PART II.,"What one day will be island, or be reef,"
5217,PART II.,"And will feed men, or wreck them. Well, well, well."
5218,PART II.,"Adieu, ye twisted thinkings. I submit: it must be."
5219,PART II.,
5220,PART II.,"Action is what one must get, it is clear,"
5221,PART II.,"And one could dream it better than one finds,"
5222,PART II.,"In its kind personal, in its motive not;"
5223,PART II.,"Not selfish as it now is, nor as now"
5224,PART II.,"Maiming the individual. If we had that,"
5225,PART II.,"It would cure all indeed. Oh, how would then"
5226,PART II.,"These pitiful rebellions of the flesh,"
5227,PART II.,"These caterwaulings of the effeminate heart,"
5228,PART II.,"These hurts of self-imagined dignity,"
5229,PART II.,Pass like the seaweed from about the bows
5230,PART II.,Of a great vessel speeding straight to sea!
5231,PART II.,"Yes, if we could have that; but I suppose"
5232,PART II.,"We shall not have it, and therefore I submit!"
5233,PART II.,
5234,PART II.,"_Sp._ (_from within_). Submit, submit!"
5235,PART II.,"’Tis common sense, and human wit"
5236,PART II.,Can claim no higher name than it.
5237,PART II.,"Submit, submit!"
5238,PART II.,
5239,PART II.,"Devotion, and ideas, and love,"
5240,PART II.,And beauty claim their place above;
5241,PART II.,But saint and sage and poet’s dreams
5242,PART II.,"Divide the light in coloured streams,"
5243,PART II.,"Which this alone gives all combined,"
5244,PART II.,The _siccum lumen_ of the mind
5245,PART II.,Called common sense: and no high wit
5246,PART II.,Gives better counsel than does it.
5247,PART II.,"Submit, submit!"
5248,PART II.,
5249,PART II.,To see things simply as they are
5250,PART II.,"Here at our elbows, transcends far"
5251,PART II.,Trying to spy out at midday
5252,PART II.,"Some ‘bright particular star,’ which may,"
5253,PART II.,"Or not, be visible at night,"
5254,PART II.,But clearly is not in daylight;
5255,PART II.,No inspiration vague outweighs
5256,PART II.,"The plain good common sense that says,"
5257,PART II.,"Submit, submit!"
5258,PART II.,"’Tis common sense, and human wit"
5259,PART II.,Can ask no higher name than it.
5260,PART II.,"Submit, submit!"

5262,PART II.,
5263,PART II.,SCENE V.—_The Piazza at Night._
5264,PART II.,
5265,PART II.,"_Di._ There have been times, not many, but enough"
5266,PART II.,To quiet all repinings of the heart;
5267,PART II.,"There have been times, in which my tranquil soul,"
5268,PART II.,"No longer nebulous, sparse, errant, seemed"
5269,PART II.,"Upon its axis solidly to move,"
5270,PART II.,Centred and fast: no mere elastic blank
5271,PART II.,"For random rays to traverse unretained,"
5272,PART II.,But rounding luminous its fair ellipse
5273,PART II.,"Around its central sun. Ay, yet again,"
5274,PART II.,"As in more faint sensations I detect,"
5275,PART II.,"With it too, round an Inner, Mightier orb,"
5276,PART II.,Maybe with that too—this I dare not say—
5277,PART II.,"Around, yet more, more central, more supreme,"
5278,PART II.,"Whate’er how numerous soe’er they be,"
5279,PART II.,"I am and feel myself, where’er I wind,"
5280,PART II.,What vagrant chance soe’er I seem to obey
5281,PART II.,Communicably theirs.
5282,PART II.,
5283,PART II.,O happy hours!
5284,PART II.,O compensation ample for long days
5285,PART II.,Of what impatient tongues call wretchedness!
5286,PART II.,"O beautiful, beneath the magic moon,"
5287,PART II.,To walk the watery way of palaces!
5288,PART II.,"O beautiful, o’ervaulted with gemmed blue,"
5289,PART II.,"This spacious court, with colour and with gold,"
5290,PART II.,"With cupolas, and pinnacles, and points,"
5291,PART II.,"And crosses multiplex, and tips and balls"
5292,PART II.,"(Wherewith the bright stars unreproving mix,"
5293,PART II.,Nor scorn by hasty eyes to be confused);
5294,PART II.,Fantastically perfect this low pile
5295,PART II.,Of Oriental glory; these long ranges
5296,PART II.,"Of classic chiselling, this gay flickering crowd."
5297,PART II.,And the calm Campanile. Beautiful!
5298,PART II.,"O beautiful! and that seemed more profound,"
5299,PART II.,This morning by the pillar when I sat
5300,PART II.,"Under the great arcade, at the review,"
5301,PART II.,"And took, and held, and ordered on my brain"
5302,PART II.,"The faces, and the voices, and the whole mass"
5303,PART II.,O’ the motley facts of existence flowing by!
5304,PART II.,"O perfect, if ’twere all! But it is not;"
5305,PART II.,Hints haunt me ever of a more beyond:
5306,PART II.,"I am rebuked by a sense of the incomplete,"
5307,PART II.,"Of a completion over soon assumed,"
5308,PART II.,"Of adding up too soon. What we call sin,"
5309,PART II.,I could believe a painful opening out
5310,PART II.,"Of paths for ampler virtue. The bare field,"
5311,PART II.,"Scant with lean ears of harvest, long had mocked"
5312,PART II.,The vext laborious farmer; came at length
5313,PART II.,The deep plough in the lazy undersoil
5314,PART II.,"Down-driving; with a cry earth’s fibres crack,"
5315,PART II.,"And a few months, and lo! the golden leas,"
5316,PART II.,And autumn’s crowded shocks and loaded wains.
5317,PART II.,"Let us look back on life; was any change,"
5318,PART II.,"Any now blest expansion, but at first"
5319,PART II.,"A pang, remorse-like, shot to the inmost seats"
5320,PART II.,"Of moral being? To do anything,"
5321,PART II.,"Distinct on any one thing to decide,"
5322,PART II.,"To leave the habitual and the old, and quit"
5323,PART II.,"The easy-chair of use and wont, seems crime"
5324,PART II.,"To the weak soul, forgetful how at first"
5325,PART II.,"Sitting down seemed so too. And, oh! this woman’s heart,"
5326,PART II.,"Fain to be forced, incredulous of choice,"
5327,PART II.,And waiting a necessity for God.
5328,PART II.,"Yet I could think, indeed, the perfect call"
5329,PART II.,Should force the perfect answer. If the voice
5330,PART II.,"Ought to receive its echo from the soul,"
5331,PART II.,"Wherefore this silence? If it _should_ rouse my being,"
5332,PART II.,Why this reluctance? Have I not thought o’ermuch
5333,PART II.,"Of other men, and of the ways of the world?"
5334,PART II.,"But what they are, or have been, matters not."
5335,PART II.,"To thine own self be true, the wise man says."
5336,PART II.,Are then my fears myself? O double self!
5337,PART II.,"And I untrue to both? Oh, there are hours,"
5338,PART II.,"When love, and faith, and dear domestic ties,"
5339,PART II.,"And converse with old friends, and pleasant walks,"
5340,PART II.,"Familiar faces, and familiar books,"
5341,PART II.,"Study, and art, upliftings unto prayer,"
5342,PART II.,"And admiration of the noblest things,"
5343,PART II.,"Seem all ignoble only; all is mean,"
5344,PART II.,"And nought as I would have it. Then at others,"
5345,PART II.,My mind is in her rest; my heart at home
5346,PART II.,"In all around; my soul secure in place,"
5347,PART II.,And the vext needle perfect to her poles.
5348,PART II.,Aimless and hopeless in my life I seem
5349,PART II.,"To thread the winding byways of the town,"
5350,PART II.,"Bewildered, baffled, hurried hence and thence,"
5351,PART II.,"All at cross-purpose even with myself,"
5352,PART II.,"Unknowing whence or whither. Thence at once,"
5353,PART II.,"At a step, I crown the Campanile’s top,"
5354,PART II.,"And view all mapped below; islands, lagoon,"
5355,PART II.,"A hundred steeples and a million roofs,"
5356,PART II.,"The fruitful champaign, and the cloud-capt Alps,"
5357,PART II.,And the broad Adriatic. Be it enough;
5358,PART II.,"If I lose this, how terrible! No, no,"
5359,PART II.,"I am contented, and will not complain."
5360,PART II.,"To the old paths, my soul! Oh, be it so!"
5361,PART II.,I bear the workday burden of dull life
5362,PART II.,"About these footsore flags of a weary world,"
5363,PART II.,"Heaven knows how long it has not been; at once,"
5364,PART II.,Lo! I am in the spirit on the Lord’s day
5365,PART II.,"With John in Patmos. Is it not enough,"
5366,PART II.,"One day in seven? and if this should go,"
5367,PART II.,"If this pure solace should desert my mind,"
5368,PART II.,What were all else? I dare not risk this loss.
5369,PART II.,"To the old paths, my soul!"
5370,PART II.,
5371,PART II.,_Sp._                      O yes.
5372,PART II.,To moon about religion; to inhume
5373,PART II.,"Your ripened age in solitary walks,"
5374,PART II.,For self-discussion; to debate in letters
5375,PART II.,Vext points with earnest friends; past other men
5376,PART II.,"To cherish natural instincts, yet to fear them"
5377,PART II.,"And less than any use them; oh, no doubt,"
5378,PART II.,"In a corner sit and mope, and be consoled"
5379,PART II.,"With thinking one is clever, while the room"
5380,PART II.,Rings through with animation and the dance.
5381,PART II.,Then talk of old examples; to pervert
5382,PART II.,Ancient real facts to modern unreal dreams
5383,PART II.,And build up baseless fabrics of romance
5384,PART II.,And heroism upon historic sand;
5385,PART II.,"To burn, forsooth, for action, yet despise"
5386,PART II.,Its merest accidence and alphabet;
5387,PART II.,"Cry out for service, and at once rebel"
5388,PART II.,At the application of its plainest rules:
5389,PART II.,"This you call life, my friend, reality;"
5390,PART II.,Doing your duty unto God and man—
5391,PART II.,"I know not what. Stay at Venice, if you will;"
5392,PART II.,Sit musing in its churches hour on hour
5393,PART II.,Cross-kneed upon a bench; climb up at whiles
5394,PART II.,"The neighbouring tower, and kill the lingering day"
5395,PART II.,"With old comparisons; when night succeeds,"
5396,PART II.,"Evading, yet a little seeking, what"
5397,PART II.,"You would and would not, turn your doubtful eyes"
5398,PART II.,On moon and stars to help morality;
5399,PART II.,"Once in a fortnight say, by lucky chance"
5400,PART II.,"Of happier-tempered coffee, gain (great Heaven!)"
5401,PART II.,A pious rapture: is it not enough?
5402,PART II.,
5403,PART II.,"_Di._ ’Tis well: thou cursed spirit, go thy way!"
5404,PART II.,I am in higher hands than yours. ’Tis well;
5405,PART II.,"Who taught you menaces? Who told you, pray,"
5406,PART II.,"Because I asked you questions, and made show"
5407,PART II.,"Of hearing what you answered, therefore——"
5408,PART II.,
5409,PART II.,"_Sp._                                       Oh,"
5410,PART II.,As if I didn’t know!
5411,PART II.,
5412,PART II.,"_Di._                Come, come, my friend,"
5413,PART II.,"I may have wavered, but I have thought better."
5414,PART II.,We’ll say no more of it.
5415,PART II.,
5416,PART II.,"_Sp._                    Oh, I dare say:"
5417,PART II.,"But as you like; ’tis your own loss; once more,"
5418,PART II.,Beware!
5419,PART II.,
5420,PART II.,_Di._ (_alone._) Must it be then? So quick upon my thought
5421,PART II.,To follow the fulfilment and the deed?
5422,PART II.,I counted not on this; I counted ever
5423,PART II.,To hold and turn it over in my hands
5424,PART II.,"Much longer, much: I took it up indeed,"
5425,PART II.,"For speculation rather; to gain thought,"
5426,PART II.,"New data. Oh, and now to be goaded on"
5427,PART II.,"By menaces, entangled among tricks;"
5428,PART II.,That I won’t suffer. Yet it is the law;
5429,PART II.,’Tis this makes action always. But for this
5430,PART II.,We ne’er should act at all; and act we must.
5431,PART II.,Why quarrel with the fashion of a fact
5432,PART II.,"Which, one way, must be, one time, why not now?"
5433,PART II.,
5434,PART II.,"_Sp._ Submit, submit!"
5435,PART II.,"For tell me then, in earth’s great laws"
5436,PART II.,"Have you found any saving clause,"
5437,PART II.,Exemption special granted you
5438,PART II.,From doing what the rest must do?
5439,PART II.,"Of common sense who made you quit,"
5440,PART II.,"And told you, you’d no need of it,"
5441,PART II.,Nor to submit?
5442,PART II.,
5443,PART II.,To move on angels’ wings were sweet;
5444,PART II.,But who would therefore scorn his feet?
5445,PART II.,It cannot walk up to the sky;
5446,PART II.,It therefore will lie down and die.
5447,PART II.,Rich meats it don’t obtain at call;
5448,PART II.,It therefore will not eat at all.
5449,PART II.,"Poor babe, and yet a babe of wit!"
5450,PART II.,"But common sense, not much of it,"
5451,PART II.,Or ’twould submit.
5452,PART II.,"Submit, submit!"
5453,PART II.,
5454,PART II.,"As your good father did before you,"
5455,PART II.,"And as the mother who first bore you,"
5456,PART II.,O yes! a child of heavenly birth!
5457,PART II.,But yet it _was_ born too on earth.
5458,PART II.,Keep your new birth for that far day
5459,PART II.,"When in the grave your bones you lay,"
5460,PART II.,"All with your kindred and connection,"
5461,PART II.,In hopes of happy resurrection.
5462,PART II.,"But how meantime to live is fit,"
5463,PART II.,Ask common sense; and what says it?
5464,PART II.,"Submit, submit!"
5465,PART II.,
5466,PART II.,
5467,PART II.,SCENE VI.—_On a Bridge._
5468,PART II.,
5469,PART II.,"_Di._ ’Tis gone, the fierce inordinate desire,"
5470,PART II.,The burning thirst for action—utterly;
5471,PART II.,"Gone, like a ship that passes in the night"
5472,PART II.,"On the high seas: gone, yet will come again:"
5473,PART II.,"Gone, yet expresses something that exists."
5474,PART II.,"Is it a thing ordained, then? is it a clue"
5475,PART II.,For my life’s conduct? is it a law for me
5476,PART II.,"That opportunity shall breed distrust,"
5477,PART II.,"Not passing until that pass? Chance and resolve,"
5478,PART II.,"Like two loose comets wandering wide in space,"
5479,PART II.,"Crossing each other’s orbits time on time,"
5480,PART II.,Meet never. Void indifference and doubt
5481,PART II.,"Let through the present boon, which ne’er turns back"
5482,PART II.,To await the after sure-arriving wish.
5483,PART II.,"How shall I then explain it to myself,"
5484,PART II.,That in blank thought my purpose lives?
5485,PART II.,The uncharged cannon mocking still the spark
5486,PART II.,"_When_ come, which _ere_ come it had loudly claimed."
5487,PART II.,Am I to let it be so still? For truly
5488,PART II.,"The need exists, I know; the wish but sleeps"
5489,PART II.,"(Sleeps, and anon will wake and cry for food);"
5490,PART II.,"And to put by these unreturning gifts,"
5491,PART II.,"Because the feeling is not with me now,"
5492,PART II.,Seems folly more than merest babyhood’s.
5493,PART II.,"But must I then do violence to myself,"
5494,PART II.,"And push on nature, force desire (that’s ill),"
5495,PART II.,"Because of knowledge? which is great, but works"
5496,PART II.,By rules of large exception; to tell which
5497,PART II.,Nought is more fallible than mere caprice.
5498,PART II.,
5499,PART II.,"What need for action yet? I am happy now,"
5500,PART II.,I feel no lack—what cause is there for haste?
5501,PART II.,Am I not happy? is not that enough?
5502,PART II.,Depart!
5503,PART II.,
5504,PART II.,"_Sp._ O yes! you thought you had escaped, no doubt,"
5505,PART II.,"This worldly fiend that follows you about,"
5506,PART II.,"This compound of convention and impiety,"
5507,PART II.,This mongrel of uncleanness and propriety.
5508,PART II.,"What else were bad enough? but, let me say,"
5509,PART II.,I too have my _grandes manières_ in my way;
5510,PART II.,"Could speak high sentiment as well as you,"
5511,PART II.,And out-blank-verse you without much ado;
5512,PART II.,"Have my religion also in my kind,"
5513,PART II.,"For dreaming unfit, because not designed."
5514,PART II.,"What! you know not that I too can be serious,"
5515,PART II.,"Can speak big words, and use the tone imperious;"
5516,PART II.,"Can speak, not honiedly, of love and beauty,"
5517,PART II.,But sternly of a something much like duty.
5518,PART II.,"Oh, do you look surprised? were never told,"
5519,PART II.,"Perhaps, that all that glitters is not gold."
5520,PART II.,"The Devil oft the Holy Scripture uses,"
5521,PART II.,But God can act the Devil when He chooses.
5522,PART II.,"Farewell! But, _verbum sapienti satis_—"
5523,PART II.,I do not make this revelation gratis.
5524,PART II.,Farewell: beware!
5525,PART II.,
5526,PART II.,_Di._ Ill spirits can quote holy books I knew;
5527,PART II.,What will they _not_ say? what not dare to do?
5528,PART II.,
5529,PART II.,"_Sp._ Beware, beware!"
5530,PART II.,
5531,PART II.,"_Di._ What, loitering still? Still, O foul spirit, there?"
5532,PART II.,"Go hence, I tell thee, go! I _will_ beware."
5533,PART II.,(_Alone._) It must be then. I feel it in my soul;
5534,PART II.,"The iron enters, sundering flesh and bone,"
5535,PART II.,And sharper than the two-edged sword of God.
5536,PART II.,"I come into deep waters—help, O help!"
5537,PART II.,The floods run over me.
5538,PART II.,
5539,PART II.,"Therefore, farewell! a long and last farewell,"
5540,PART II.,"Ye pious sweet simplicities of life,"
5541,PART II.,"Good books, good friends, and holy moods, and all"
5542,PART II.,"That lent rough life sweet Sunday seeming rests,"
5543,PART II.,"Making earth heaven-like. Welcome, wicked world,"
5544,PART II.,"The hardening heart, the calculating brain"
5545,PART II.,"Narrowing its doors to thought, the lying lips,"
5546,PART II.,"The calm-dissembling eyes; the greedy flesh,"
5547,PART II.,"The world, the Devil—welcome, welcome, welcome!"
5548,PART II.,
5549,PART II.,_Sp._ (_from within._) This stern necessity of things
5550,PART II.,On every side our being rings;
5551,PART II.,Our sallying eager actions fall
5552,PART II.,Vainly against that iron wall.
5553,PART II.,"Where once her finger points the way,"
5554,PART II.,The wise thinks only to obey;
5555,PART II.,"Take life as she has ordered it,"
5556,PART II.,"And come what may of it, submit,"
5557,PART II.,"Submit, submit!"
5558,PART II.,
5559,PART II.,"Who take implicitly her will,"
5560,PART II.,For these her vassal chances still
5561,PART II.,"Bring store of joys, successes, pleasures;"
5562,PART II.,"But whoso ponders, weighs, and measures,"
5563,PART II.,She calls her torturers up to goad
5564,PART II.,With spur and scourges on the road;
5565,PART II.,He does at last with pain whate’er
5566,PART II.,"He spurned at first. Of such, beware,"
5567,PART II.,"Beware, beware!"
5568,PART II.,
5569,PART II.,"_Di._ O God, O God! The great floods of the soul"
5570,PART II.,Flow over me! I come into deep waters
5571,PART II.,Where no ground is!
5572,PART II.,
5573,PART II.,_Sp._ Don’t be the least afraid;
5574,PART II.,There’s not the slightest reason for alarm;
5575,PART II.,I only meant by a perhaps rough shake
5576,PART II.,"To rouse you from a dreamy, unhealthy sleep."
5577,PART II.,"Up, then—up, and be going: the large world,"
5578,PART II.,The thronged life waits us.
5579,PART II.,"Come, my pretty boy,"
5580,PART II.,You have been making mows to the blank sky
5581,PART II.,Quite long enough for good. We’ll put you up
5582,PART II.,Into the higher form. ’Tis time you learn
5583,PART II.,"The Second Reverence, for things around."
5584,PART II.,"Up, then, and go amongst them; don’t be timid;"
5585,PART II.,Look at them quietly a bit: by-and-by
5586,PART II.,"Respect will come, and healthy appetite."
5587,PART II.,So let us go.
5588,PART II.,How now! not yet awake?
5589,PART II.,"Oh, you will sleep yet, will you! Oh, you shirk,"
5590,PART II.,"You try and slink away! You cannot, eh?"
5591,PART II.,"Nay now, what folly’s this? Why will you fool yourself?"
5592,PART II.,Why will you walk about thus with your eyes shut?
5593,PART II.,Treating for facts the self-made hues that flash
5594,PART II.,"On tight-pressed pupils, which you know are not facts."
5595,PART II.,To use the undistorted light of the sun
5596,PART II.,Is not a crime; to look straight out upon
5597,PART II.,The big plain things that stare one in the face
5598,PART II.,Does not contaminate; to see pollutes not
5599,PART II.,"What one must feel if one won’t see, what _is_,"
5600,PART II.,"And will be too, howe’er we blink, and must"
5601,PART II.,One way or other make itself observed.
5602,PART II.,Free walking’s better than being led about; and
5603,PART II.,"What will the blind man do, I wonder, if"
5604,PART II.,Some one should cut the string of his dog? Just think!
5605,PART II.,"What could you do, if I should go away?"
5606,PART II.,"Oh, you have paths of your own before you, have you?"
5607,PART II.,"What shall it take to? literature, no doubt?"
5608,PART II.,"Novels, reviews? or poems! if you please!"
5609,PART II.,"The strong fresh gale of life will feel, no doubt,"
5610,PART II.,The influx of your mouthful of soft air.
5611,PART II.,"Well, make the most of that small stock of knowledge"
5612,PART II.,You’ve condescended to receive from me;
5613,PART II.,"That’s your best chance. Oh, you despise that! Oh."
5614,PART II.,"Prate then of passions you have known in dreams,"
5615,PART II.,Of huge experience gathered by the eye;
5616,PART II.,"Be large of aspiration, pure in hope,"
5617,PART II.,"Sweet in fond longings, but in all things vague;"
5618,PART II.,"Breathe out your dreamy scepticism, relieved"
5619,PART II.,"By snatches of old songs. People will like that, doubtless."
5620,PART II.,Or will you write about philosophy?
5621,PART II.,For a waste far-off _maybe_ overlooking
5622,PART II.,"The fruitful _is_ close by, live in metaphysic,"
5623,PART II.,"With transcendental logic fill your stomach,"
5624,PART II.,"Schematise joy, effigiate meat and drink;"
5625,PART II.,"Or, let me see, a mighty work, a volume,"
5626,PART II.,"The Complemental of the inferior Kant,"
5627,PART II.,"The Critic of Pure Practice, based upon"
5628,PART II.,"The Antinomies of the Moral Sense: for, look you,"
5629,PART II.,"We cannot act without assuming _x_,"
5630,PART II.,"And at the same time _y_, its contradictory;"
5631,PART II.,"Ergo, to act. People will buy that, doubtless."
5632,PART II.,Or you’ll perhaps teach youth (I do not question
5633,PART II.,"Some downward turn you may find, some evasion"
5634,PART II.,Of the broad highway’s glaring white ascent);
5635,PART II.,"Teach youth, in a small way, that is, always,"
5636,PART II.,So as to have much time left you for yourself;
5637,PART II.,"This you can’t sacrifice, your leisure’s precious."
5638,PART II.,Heartily you will not take to anything;
5639,PART II.,"Whatever happen, don’t I see you still,"
5640,PART II.,Living no life at all? Even as now
5641,PART II.,"An o’ergrown baby, sucking at the dugs"
5642,PART II.,"Of instinct, dry long since. Come, come, you are old enough"
5643,PART II.,For spoon-meat surely.
5644,PART II.,Will you go on thus
5645,PART II.,Until death end you? if indeed it does.
5646,PART II.,"For what it does, none knows. Yet as for you,"
5647,PART II.,You’ll hardly have the courage to die outright;
5648,PART II.,"You’ll somehow halve even it. Methinks I see you,"
5649,PART II.,"Through everlasting limbos of void time,"
5650,PART II.,"Twirling and twiddling ineffectively,"
5651,PART II.,And indeterminately swaying for ever.
5652,PART II.,"Come, come, spoon-meat at any rate."
5653,PART II.,"Well, well,"
5654,PART II.,"I will not persecute you more, my friend."
5655,PART II.,"Only do think, as I observed before,"
5656,PART II.,"What can you do, if I should go away?"
5657,PART II.,
5658,PART II.,"_Di._ Is the hour here, then? Is the minute come—"
5659,PART II.,The irreprievable instant of stern time?
5660,PART II.,"O for a few, few grains in the running glass,"
5661,PART II.,Or for some power to hold them! O for a few
5662,PART II.,Of all that went so wastefully before!
5663,PART II.,"It must be then, e’en now."
5664,PART II.,
5665,PART II.,"_Sp._ (_from within._) It must, it must."
5666,PART II.,’Tis common sense! and human wit
5667,PART II.,Can claim no higher name than it.
5668,PART II.,"Submit, submit!"
5669,PART II.,
5670,PART II.,Necessity! and who shall dare
5671,PART II.,Bring to _her_ feet excuse or prayer?
5672,PART II.,"Beware, beware!"
5673,PART II.,"We must, we must."
5674,PART II.,"Howe’er we turn, and pause and tremble—"
5675,PART II.,"Howe’er we shrink, deceive, dissemble—"
5676,PART II.,"Whate’er our doubting, grief, disgust,"
5677,PART II.,"The hand is on us, and we must,"
5678,PART II.,"We must, we must."
5679,PART II.,’Tis common sense! and human wit
5680,PART II.,Can find no better name than
5681,PART II.,"Submit, submit!"

5684,PART II.,SCENE VII.—_At Torcello._ _Dipsychus alone._
5685,PART II.,
5686,PART II.,_Di._ I had a vision; was it in my sleep?
5687,PART II.,"And if it were, what then? But sleep or wake,"
5688,PART II.,I saw a great light open o’er my head;
5689,PART II.,"And sleep or wake, uplifted to that light,"
5690,PART II.,Out of that light proceeding heard a voice
5691,PART II.,"Uttering high words, which, whether sleep or wake,"
5692,PART II.,"In me were fixed, and in me must abide."
5693,PART II.,"When the enemy is near thee,"
5694,PART II.,Call on us!
5695,PART II.,"In our hands we will upbear thee,"
5696,PART II.,"He shall neither scathe nor scare thee,"
5697,PART II.,"He shall fly thee, and shall fear thee."
5698,PART II.,Call on us!
5699,PART II.,"Call when all good friends have left thee,"
5700,PART II.,Of all good sights and sounds bereft thee;
5701,PART II.,"Call when hope and heart are sinking,"
5702,PART II.,"And the brain is sick with thinking,"
5703,PART II.,"Help, O help!"
5704,PART II.,"Call, and following close behind thee"
5705,PART II.,"There shall haste, and there shall find thee,"
5706,PART II.,"Help, sure help."
5707,PART II.,
5708,PART II.,"When the panic comes upon thee,"
5709,PART II.,"When necessity seems on thee,"
5710,PART II.,"Hope and choice have all foregone thee,"
5711,PART II.,"Fate and force are closing o’er thee,"
5712,PART II.,And but one way stands before thee—
5713,PART II.,Call on us!
5714,PART II.,"Oh, and if thou dost not call,"
5715,PART II.,"Be but faithful, that is all."
5716,PART II.,"Go right on, and close behind thee"
5717,PART II.,"There shall follow still and find thee,"
5718,PART II.,"Help, sure help."
5719,PART II.,
5720,PART II.,
5721,PART II.,SCENE VIII.—_In the Piazza._
5722,PART II.,
5723,PART II.,"_Di._ Not for thy service, thou imperious fiend,"
5724,PART II.,"Not to do thy work, or the like of thine;"
5725,PART II.,"Not to please thee, O base and fallen spirit!"
5726,PART II.,"But One Most High, Most True, whom without thee"
5727,PART II.,It seems I cannot.
5728,PART II.,O the misery
5729,PART II.,That one must truck and pactise with the world
5730,PART II.,"To gain the ’vantage-ground to assail it from,"
5731,PART II.,"To set upon the Giant one must first,"
5732,PART II.,O perfidy! have eat the Giant’s bread.
5733,PART II.,"If I submit, it is but to gain time"
5734,PART II.,And arms and stature: ’tis but to lie safe
5735,PART II.,Until the hour strike to arise and slay:
5736,PART II.,’Tis the old story of the adder’s brood
5737,PART II.,Feeding and nestling till the fangs be grown.
5738,PART II.,"Were it not nobler done, then, to act fair,"
5739,PART II.,"To accept the service with the wages, do"
5740,PART II.,Frankly the devil’s work for the devil’s pay?
5741,PART II.,"Oh, but another my allegiance holds"
5742,PART II.,Inalienably his. How much soe’er
5743,PART II.,"I might submit, it must be to rebel."
5744,PART II.,"Submit then sullenly, that’s no dishonour."
5745,PART II.,Yet I could deem it better too to starve
5746,PART II.,"And die untraitored. O, who sent me, though?"
5747,PART II.,"Sent me, and to do something—O hard master!—"
5748,PART II.,To do a treachery. But indeed ’tis done;
5749,PART II.,I have already taken of the pay
5750,PART II.,"And curst the payer; take I must, curse too."
5751,PART II.,Alas! the little strength that I possess
5752,PART II.,"Derives, I think, of him. So still it is,"
5753,PART II.,"The timid child that clung unto her skirts,"
5754,PART II.,"A boy, will slight his mother, and, grown a man,"
5755,PART II.,His father too. There’s Scripture too for that!
5756,PART II.,Do we owe fathers nothing—mothers nought?
5757,PART II.,"Is filial duty folly? Yet He says,"
5758,PART II.,"‘He that loves father, mother more than me;’"
5759,PART II.,"Yea, and ‘the man his parents shall desert,’"
5760,PART II.,"The Ordinance says, ‘and cleave unto his wife.’"
5761,PART II.,"O man, behold thy wife, the hard naked world;"
5762,PART II.,"Adam, accept thy Eve."
5763,PART II.,"So still it is,"
5764,PART II.,"The tree exhausts the soil; creepers kill it,"
5765,PART II.,Their insects them: the lever finds its fulcrum
5766,PART II.,On what it then o’erthrows; the homely spade
5767,PART II.,In labour’s hand unscrupulously seeks
5768,PART II.,Its first momentum on the very clod
5769,PART II.,Which next will be upturned. It seems a law.
5770,PART II.,"And am not I, though I but ill recall"
5771,PART II.,"My happier age, a kidnapped child of Heaven,"
5772,PART II.,Whom these uncircumcised Philistines
5773,PART II.,"Have by foul play shorn, blinded, maimed, and kept"
5774,PART II.,For what more glorious than to make them sport?
5775,PART II.,"Wait, then, wait, O my soul! grow, grow, ye locks,"
5776,PART II.,"Then perish they, and if need is, I too."
5777,PART II.,
5778,PART II.,_Sp._ (_aside._) A truly admirable proceeding!
5779,PART II.,Could there be finer special pleading
5780,PART II.,When scruples would be interceding?
5781,PART II.,There’s no occasion I should stay;
5782,PART II.,"He is working out, his own queer way,"
5783,PART II.,The sum I set him; and this day
5784,PART II.,"Will bring it, neither less nor bigger,"
5785,PART II.,Exact to my predestined figure.

5787,PART II.,
5788,PART II.,SCENE IX.—_In the Public Garden._
5789,PART II.,
5790,PART II.,_Di._ Twenty-one past—twenty-five coming on;
5791,PART II.,"One-third of life departed, nothing done."
5792,PART II.,Out of the mammon of unrighteousness
5793,PART II.,"That we make friends, the Scripture is express."
5794,PART II.,"My Spirit, come, we will agree;"
5795,PART II.,"Content, you’ll take a moiety."
5796,PART II.,
5797,PART II.,"_Sp._ A moiety, ye gods, he, he!"
5798,PART II.,
5799,PART II.,_Di._ Three-quarters then? O griping beast;
5800,PART II.,Leave me a decimal at least.
5801,PART II.,
5802,PART II.,"_Sp._ Oh, one of ten! to infect the nine"
5803,PART II.,And make the devil a one be mine!
5804,PART II.,"Oh, one! to jib all day, God wot,"
5805,PART II.,When all the rest would go full trot!
5806,PART II.,"One very little one, eh? to doubt with,"
5807,PART II.,"Just to pause, think, and look about with?"
5808,PART II.,In course! you counted on no less—
5809,PART II.,You thought it likely I’d say yes!
5810,PART II.,
5811,PART II.,"_Di._ Be it then thus—since that it must, it seems."
5812,PART II.,"Welcome, O world, henceforth; and farewell dreams!"
5813,PART II.,"Yet know, Mephisto, know, nor you nor I"
5814,PART II.,Can in this matter either sell or buy;
5815,PART II.,For the fee simple of this trifling lot
5816,PART II.,"To you or me, trust me, pertaineth not."
5817,PART II.,"I can but render what is of my will,"
5818,PART II.,And behind it somewhat remaineth still.
5819,PART II.,"Oh, your sole chance was in the childish mind"
5820,PART II.,Whose darkness dreamed that vows like this could bind;
5821,PART II.,"Thinking all lost, it made all lost, and brought"
5822,PART II.,In fact the ruin which had been but thought.
5823,PART II.,"Thank Heaven (or you) that’s past these many years,"
5824,PART II.,And we have knowledge wiser than our fears.
5825,PART II.,"So your poor bargain take, my man,"
5826,PART II.,And make the best of it you can.
5827,PART II.,
5828,PART II.,"_Sp._ With reservations! oh, how treasonable!"
5829,PART II.,When I had let you off so reasonable.
5830,PART II.,"However, I don’t fear; be it so!"
5831,PART II.,"Brutus is honourable, I know;"
5832,PART II.,"So mindful of the dues of others,"
5833,PART II.,"So thoughtful for his poor dear brothers,"
5834,PART II.,"So scrupulous, considerate, kind—"
5835,PART II.,He wouldn’t leave the devil behind
5836,PART II.,If he assured him he had claims
5837,PART II.,For his good company to hell-flames!
5838,PART II.,"No matter, no matter, the bargain’s made;"
5839,PART II.,And I for my part will not be afraid.
5840,PART II.,"With reservations! oh! ho, ho!"
5841,PART II.,"But time, my friend, has yet to show"
5842,PART II.,Which of us two will closest fit
5843,PART II.,The proverb of the Biter Bit.
5844,PART II.,
5845,PART II.,"_Di._ Tell me thy name, now it is over."
5846,PART II.,
5847,PART II.,_Sp._                                   Oh!
5848,PART II.,"Why, Mephistophiles, you know—"
5849,PART II.,At least you’ve lately called me so;
5850,PART II.,Belial it was some days ago.
5851,PART II.,But take your pick; I’ve got a score—
5852,PART II.,Never a royal baby more.
5853,PART II.,For a brass plate upon a door
5854,PART II.,What think you of _Cosmocrator_?
5855,PART II.,
5856,PART II.,_Di._ Τοὺς κοσμοκράτορας τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου.
5857,PART II.,"And that you are indeed, I do not doubt you."
5858,PART II.,
5859,PART II.,"_Sp._ Ephesians, ain’t it? near the end"
5860,PART II.,You dropt a word to spare your friend.
5861,PART II.,"What follows, too, in application"
5862,PART II.,Would be absurd exaggeration.
5863,PART II.,
5864,PART II.,_Di._ The Power of this World! hateful unto God.
5865,PART II.,
5866,PART II.,"_Sp._ Cosmarchon’s shorter, but sounds odd:"
5867,PART II.,"One wouldn’t like, even if a true devil,"
5868,PART II.,To be taken for a vulgar Jew devil.
5869,PART II.,
5870,PART II.,_Di._ Yet in all these things we—’tis Scripture too—
5871,PART II.,"Are more than conquerors, even over you."
5872,PART II.,
5873,PART II.,"_Sp._ Come, come, don’t maunder any longer,"
5874,PART II.,Time tests the weaker and the stronger;
5875,PART II.,"And we, without procrastination,"
5876,PART II.,"Must set, you know, to our vocation."
5877,PART II.,O goodness; won’t you find it pleasant
5878,PART II.,To own the positive and present;
5879,PART II.,"To see yourself like people round,"
5880,PART II.,And feel your feet upon the ground! (_Exeunt._)

5925,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"than we old boys that were there. But whatever else they were or did,"
5926,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"they certainly were in harmony with the world, and they certainly did not"
5927,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,disqualify the country’s youth for after-life and the country’s service.’
5928,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5929,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘But, my dear sir, this bringing the schools of the country into harmony"
5930,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,with public opinion is exactly——’
5931,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5932,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘Don’t interrupt me with public opinion, my dear nephew; you’ll quote me"
5933,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"a leading article next. “Young men must be young men,” as the worthy head"
5934,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"of your college said to me touching a case of rustication. “My dear sir,”"
5935,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"said I, “I only wish to heaven they would be; but as for my own nephews,"
5936,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"they seem to me a sort of hobbadi-hoy cherub, too big to be innocent, and"
5937,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,too simple for anything else. They’re full of the notion of the world
5938,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"being so wicked and of their taking a higher line, as they call it. I"
5939,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,only fear they’ll never take any line at all.” What is the true purpose
5940,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,of education? Simply to make plain to the young understanding the laws
5941,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"of the life they will have to enter. For example—that lying won’t do,"
5942,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,thieving still less; that idleness will get punished; that if they are
5943,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"cowards, the whole world will be against them; that if they will have"
5944,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"their own way, they must fight for it. As for the conscience, mamma, I"
5945,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"take it—such as mammas are now-a-days, at any rate—has probably set that"
5946,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,agoing fast enough already. What a blessing to see her good little child
5947,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,come back a brave young devil-may-care!’
5948,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5949,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘Exactly, my dear sir. As if at twelve or fourteen a roundabout boy, with"
5950,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"his three meals a day inside him, is likely to be over-troubled with"
5951,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,scruples.’
5952,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5953,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘Put him through a strong course of confirmation and sacraments, backed"
5954,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"up with sermons and private admonitions, and what is much the same as"
5955,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"auricular confession, and really, my dear nephew, I can’t answer for it"
5956,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,but he mayn’t turn out as great a goose as you—pardon me—_were_ about the
5957,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,age of eighteen or nineteen.’
5958,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5959,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘But to have passed _through_ that, my dear sir! surely that can be no"
5960,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,harm.’
5961,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5962,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘I don’t know. Your constitutions don’t seem to recover it, quite. We did"
5963,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,without these foolish measles well enough in my time.’
5964,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5965,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘Westminster had its Cowper, my dear sir; and other schools had theirs"
5966,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"also, mute and inglorious, but surely not few.’"
5967,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5968,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘Ah, ah! the beginning of troubles——’"
5969,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5970,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘You see, my dear sir, you must not refer it to Arnold, at all at all."
5971,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,Anything that Arnold did in this direction——’
5972,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5973,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘Why, my dear boy, how often have I not heard from you, how he used to"
5974,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"attack offences, not as offences—the right view—against discipline, but"
5975,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"as sin, heinous guilt, I don’t know what beside! Why didn’t he flog them"
5976,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"and hold his tongue? Flog them he did, but why preach?’"
5977,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5978,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘If he did err in this way, sir, which I hardly think, I ascribe it to"
5979,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"the spirit of the time. The real cause of the evil you complain of, which"
5980,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"to a certain extent I admit, was, I take it, the religious movement of"
5981,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"the last century, beginning with Wesleyanism, and culminating at last in"
5982,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"Puseyism. This over-excitation of the religious sense, resulting in this"
5983,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"irrational, almost animal irritability of consciences, was, in many ways,"
5984,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,as foreign to Arnold as it is proper to——’
5985,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,
5986,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"‘Well, well, my dear nephew, if you like to make a theory of it, pray"
5987,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,write it out for yourself nicely in full; but your poor old uncle does
5988,EPILOGUE TO DIPSYCHUS.,"not like theories, and is moreover sadly sleepy.’"

6004,A FRAGMENT.,
6005,A FRAGMENT.,_Dipsychus._ O God! O God! and must I still go on
6006,A FRAGMENT.,"Doing this work—I know not, hell’s or thine;"
6007,A FRAGMENT.,And these rewards receiving—sure not thine;
6008,A FRAGMENT.,"The adulation of a foolish crowd,"
6009,A FRAGMENT.,Half foolish and half greedy; upright judge—
6010,A FRAGMENT.,Lawyer acute—the Mansfield and the Hale
6011,A FRAGMENT.,In one united to bless modern Courts.
6012,A FRAGMENT.,"O God! O God! According to the law,"
6013,A FRAGMENT.,"With solemn face to solemn sentence fit,"
6014,A FRAGMENT.,Doing the justice that is but half just;
6015,A FRAGMENT.,Punishing wrong that is not truly wrong!
6016,A FRAGMENT.,"Administering, alas, God! not Thy law."
6017,A FRAGMENT.,
6018,A FRAGMENT.,(_Knock at the door._)
6019,A FRAGMENT.,
6020,A FRAGMENT.,What? Is the hour already for the Court?

6022,A FRAGMENT.,
6023,A FRAGMENT.,(_Enter a Servant._)
6024,A FRAGMENT.,
6025,A FRAGMENT.,"_Serv._ My lord, a woman begging to be seen."
6026,A FRAGMENT.,
6027,A FRAGMENT.,_Di._ A woman begging to be seen? What’s this?
6028,A FRAGMENT.,"’Tis not the duty of your post, my friend,"
6029,A FRAGMENT.,To give admittance on the busy days
6030,A FRAGMENT.,Of a hard labourer in this great world
6031,A FRAGMENT.,To all poor creatures begging to be seen.
6032,A FRAGMENT.,Something unusual in it? Bid her wait
6033,A FRAGMENT.,"In the room below, I’ll see her as I pass."
6034,A FRAGMENT.,Is the horse there?
6035,A FRAGMENT.,
6036,A FRAGMENT.,"_Serv._ He’s coming round, my lord."
6037,A FRAGMENT.,
6038,A FRAGMENT.,_Di._ Say I will see her as I pass. (_Exit Servant._)
6039,A FRAGMENT.,"I have but one way left; but that one way,"
6040,A FRAGMENT.,"On which once entered, there is no return;"
6041,A FRAGMENT.,"And as there’s no return, no looking back,"
6042,A FRAGMENT.,Amidst the smoky tumult of this field
6043,A FRAGMENT.,"Whereon, enlisted once, in arms we stand,"
6044,A FRAGMENT.,"Nor know, nor e’en remotely can divine"
6045,A FRAGMENT.,"The sense, or purport, or the probable end,"
6046,A FRAGMENT.,"One only guide to our blind work we keep,"
6047,A FRAGMENT.,"To obey orders, and to fight it out."
6048,A FRAGMENT.,"Some hapless sad petitioner, no doubt,"
6049,A FRAGMENT.,"With the true plaintiveness of real distress,"
6050,A FRAGMENT.,"Twisting her misery to a marketable lie,"
6051,A FRAGMENT.,To waste my close-shorn interval of rest.
6052,A FRAGMENT.,"_She_ came upon me in my weaker thoughts,"
6053,A FRAGMENT.,"Those weaker thoughts that still indeed recur,"
6054,A FRAGMENT.,"But come, my servants, at a word to go."
6055,A FRAGMENT.,
6056,A FRAGMENT.,(_Enter Woman._)
6057,A FRAGMENT.,
6058,A FRAGMENT.,What is it? what have you to say to me?
6059,A FRAGMENT.,Who are you?
6060,A FRAGMENT.,
6061,A FRAGMENT.,_Wom._ Once you knew me well enough.
6062,A FRAGMENT.,
6063,A FRAGMENT.,"_Di._ Oh, you! I had been told that you were dead."
6064,A FRAGMENT.,
6065,A FRAGMENT.,_Wom._ So your creatures said;
6066,A FRAGMENT.,"But I shall live, I think, till you die too."
6067,A FRAGMENT.,
6068,A FRAGMENT.,"_Di._ What do you want? Money, subsistence, bread?"
6069,A FRAGMENT.,
6070,A FRAGMENT.,"_Wom._ I wanted bread, money, all things, ’tis true,"
6071,A FRAGMENT.,"But wanted, above all things, to see you."
6072,A FRAGMENT.,
6073,A FRAGMENT.,_Di._ This cannot be. What has been done is o’er.
6074,A FRAGMENT.,You have no claim or right against me more;
6075,A FRAGMENT.,I have dealt justly with you to the uttermost.
6076,A FRAGMENT.,
6077,A FRAGMENT.,_Wom._ I did not come to say you were unjust—
6078,A FRAGMENT.,I came to see you only.
6079,A FRAGMENT.,
6080,A FRAGMENT.,_Di._                 Hear me now.
6081,A FRAGMENT.,"Remember, it was not the marriage vow,"
6082,A FRAGMENT.,"Nor promise e’er of chaste fidelity,"
6083,A FRAGMENT.,That joined us thirty years ago in a tie
6084,A FRAGMENT.,"Which I, I think, scarce sought. It was not I"
6085,A FRAGMENT.,That took your innocence; you spoiled me of mine.
6086,A FRAGMENT.,"And yet, as though the vow had been divine,"
6087,A FRAGMENT.,Was I not faithful? Were you so to me?
6088,A FRAGMENT.,"Had you been white in spotless purity,"
6089,A FRAGMENT.,Could I have clung to you more faithfully?
6090,A FRAGMENT.,"I left you, after wrongs I blush with shame"
6091,A FRAGMENT.,E’en now through all my fifty years to name.
6092,A FRAGMENT.,"I left you; yet I stinted still my ease,—"
6093,A FRAGMENT.,"Curtailed my pleasures—toil still extra toil,—"
6094,A FRAGMENT.,To repay you for what you never gave.
6095,A FRAGMENT.,Is it not true?
6096,A FRAGMENT.,
6097,A FRAGMENT.,"_Wom._         Go on, say all and more."
6098,A FRAGMENT.,"Upon this body, as the basis, lies"
6099,A FRAGMENT.,The ladder that has raised you to the skies.
6100,A FRAGMENT.,
6101,A FRAGMENT.,_Di._ Is that so much? am I indeed so high?
6102,A FRAGMENT.,Am I not rather
6103,A FRAGMENT.,"The slave and servant of the wretched world,"
6104,A FRAGMENT.,Liveried and finely dressed—yet all the same
6105,A FRAGMENT.,A menial and lacquey seeking place
6106,A FRAGMENT.,"For hire, and for his hire’s sake doing work?"
6107,A FRAGMENT.,
6108,A FRAGMENT.,_Wom._ I do not know; you have wife and child I know
6109,A FRAGMENT.,"Domestic comfort and a noble name,"
6110,A FRAGMENT.,And people speak in my ears too your praise.
6111,A FRAGMENT.,"O man, O man! do you not know in your heart"
6112,A FRAGMENT.,It was for this you came to me—
6113,A FRAGMENT.,It was for this I took you to my breast?
6114,A FRAGMENT.,"O man, man, man!"
6115,A FRAGMENT.,"You come to us with your dalliance in the street,"
6116,A FRAGMENT.,"You pay us with your miserable gold,"
6117,A FRAGMENT.,You do not know how in the——
6118,A FRAGMENT.,
6119,A FRAGMENT.,_Di._ (_looks at his watch_). You must go now. Justice
6120,A FRAGMENT.,calls me elsewhere;
6121,A FRAGMENT.,Justice—might keep you here.
6122,A FRAGMENT.,"You may return again; stay, let me see—"
6123,A FRAGMENT.,Six weeks to-morrow you shall see me again;
6124,A FRAGMENT.,"Now you must go. Do you need money? here,"
6125,A FRAGMENT.,"It is your due: take it, that you may live;"
6126,A FRAGMENT.,"And see me, six weeks from to-morrow, elsewhere."
6127,A FRAGMENT.,
6128,A FRAGMENT.,_Wom._               I will not go;
6129,A FRAGMENT.,"You must stay here and hear me, or I shall die!"
6130,A FRAGMENT.,It were ill for you that I should.
6131,A FRAGMENT.,
6132,A FRAGMENT.,_Di._            What! shall the nation wait?
6133,A FRAGMENT.,"Woman, if I have wronged you, it was for good—"
6134,A FRAGMENT.,"Good has come of it. Lo, I have done some work."
6135,A FRAGMENT.,Over the blasted and the blackened spot
6136,A FRAGMENT.,Of our unhappy and unhallowed deed
6137,A FRAGMENT.,I have raised a mausoleum of such acts
6138,A FRAGMENT.,"As in this world do honour unto me,"
6139,A FRAGMENT.,But in the next to thee.
6140,A FRAGMENT.,
6141,A FRAGMENT.,"_Wom._                   Hear me, I cannot go!"
6142,A FRAGMENT.,
6143,A FRAGMENT.,"_Di._ It cannot be; the court, the nation waits."
6144,A FRAGMENT.,"Is not the work, too, yours?"
6145,A FRAGMENT.,
6146,A FRAGMENT.,"_Wom._                      I go, to die this night!"
6147,A FRAGMENT.,
6148,A FRAGMENT.,_Di._ I cannot help it. Duty lies here. Depart!
6149,A FRAGMENT.,
6150,A FRAGMENT.,"_Wom._ Listen; before I die, one word! In old times"
6151,A FRAGMENT.,You called me Pleasure—my name now is Guilt.
6152,A FRAGMENT.,
6153,A FRAGMENT.,
6154,A FRAGMENT.,SCENE II.—_In Westminster Hall._
6155,A FRAGMENT.,
6156,A FRAGMENT.,_1st Barrister._ They say the Lord Chief Justice is unwell;
6157,A FRAGMENT.,"Did you observe how, after that decision"
6158,A FRAGMENT.,"Which all the world admired so, suddenly"
6159,A FRAGMENT.,"He became pale and looked in the air and staggered,"
6160,A FRAGMENT.,As if some phantom floated on his eyes?
6161,A FRAGMENT.,He is a strange man.
6162,A FRAGMENT.,
6163,A FRAGMENT.,"_Bar. 2._ He is unwell, there is no doubt of that,"
6164,A FRAGMENT.,But why or how is quite another question.
6165,A FRAGMENT.,It is odd to find so stern and strong a man
6166,A FRAGMENT.,"Give way before he’s sixty. Many a mind,"
6167,A FRAGMENT.,"Apparently less vigorous than his,"
6168,A FRAGMENT.,"Has kept its full judicial faculty,"
6169,A FRAGMENT.,And sat the woolsack past threescore and ten.
6170,A FRAGMENT.,
6171,A FRAGMENT.,_Bar. 3._ No business to be done to-day. Have you heard
6172,A FRAGMENT.,The Chief Justice is lying dangerously ill?
6173,A FRAGMENT.,"Apoplexy, paralysis, Heaven knows what—some seizure."
6174,A FRAGMENT.,
6175,A FRAGMENT.,_Bar. 1._ Heavens! that will be a loss indeed!
6176,A FRAGMENT.,
6177,A FRAGMENT.,_Bar. 2._                                      A loss
6178,A FRAGMENT.,"Which will be some one’s gain, however."
6179,A FRAGMENT.,
6180,A FRAGMENT.,"_Bar. 1._                         Not the nation’s,"
6181,A FRAGMENT.,If this sage Chancellor give it to ——
6182,A FRAGMENT.,"But is he really sure to die, do you think?"
6183,A FRAGMENT.,
6184,A FRAGMENT.,_Bar. 3._ A very sudden and very alarming attack.
6185,A FRAGMENT.,"And now you know to the full as much as I,"
6186,A FRAGMENT.,"Or, as I fancy, any lawyer here."
6187,A FRAGMENT.,
6188,A FRAGMENT.,_Bar. 2._ Do you know anything of his early life?
6189,A FRAGMENT.,
6190,A FRAGMENT.,"_Bar. 1._ My father knew him at college: a reading man,"
6191,A FRAGMENT.,"The quietest of the quiet, shy and timid."
6192,A FRAGMENT.,"And college honours past,"
6193,A FRAGMENT.,No one believed he ever would do anything.
6194,A FRAGMENT.,
6195,A FRAGMENT.,"_Bar. 2._ He was a moral sort of prig, I’ve heard,"
6196,A FRAGMENT.,Till he was twenty-five; and even then
6197,A FRAGMENT.,He never entered into life as most men.
6198,A FRAGMENT.,That is the reason why he fails so soon.
6199,A FRAGMENT.,It takes high feeding and a well-taught conscience
6200,A FRAGMENT.,To breed your mighty hero of the law.
6201,A FRAGMENT.,So much the worse for him; so much the better
6202,A FRAGMENT.,For all expectants now.
6203,A FRAGMENT.,
6204,A FRAGMENT.,"_Bar. 3._             For ——, for one."
6205,A FRAGMENT.,
6206,A FRAGMENT.,"_Bar. 2._ Well, there’ll be several changes, as I think."
6207,A FRAGMENT.,Not that I think the shock of new promotion
6208,A FRAGMENT.,Will vibrate quite perceptibly down here.
6209,A FRAGMENT.,"There was a story that I once was told,"
6210,A FRAGMENT.,Some woman that they used to tease him with.
6211,A FRAGMENT.,
6212,A FRAGMENT.,_Bar. 1._ He grew too stern for teasing before long;
6213,A FRAGMENT.,A man with greater power of what I think
6214,A FRAGMENT.,"They call, in some new sense of the word, Repulsion,"
6215,A FRAGMENT.,I think I never saw in all my life.
6216,A FRAGMENT.,
6217,A FRAGMENT.,"_Bar. 2._ A most forbidding man in private life,"
6218,A FRAGMENT.,I’ve always heard. What’s this new news?
6219,A FRAGMENT.,
6220,A FRAGMENT.,_Bar. 4._ The Lord Chief Justice has resigned.
6221,A FRAGMENT.,
6222,A FRAGMENT.,"_Bar. 1, 2, 3._                        Is it true?"
6223,A FRAGMENT.,Really? Quite certain?
6224,A FRAGMENT.,
6225,A FRAGMENT.,_Bar. 4._                Publicly announced.
6226,A FRAGMENT.,You’re quite behind. Most probably ere this
6227,A FRAGMENT.,The _Times_ has got it in a new edition.

6230,A FRAGMENT.,"SCENE III.—_Dipsychus in his own house, alone._"
6231,A FRAGMENT.,

6233,A FRAGMENT.,She would go hence and die; I cannot tell.
6234,A FRAGMENT.,"Should I have made the nation’s business wait,"
6235,A FRAGMENT.,That I might listen to an old sad tale
6236,A FRAGMENT.,Uselessly iterated? Ah—ah me!
6237,A FRAGMENT.,I am grown weak indeed; those old black thoughts
6238,A FRAGMENT.,"No more as servants at my bidding go,"
6239,A FRAGMENT.,"But as stern tyrants look me in the face,"
6240,A FRAGMENT.,And mock my reason’s inefficient hand
6241,A FRAGMENT.,That sways to wave them hence.
6242,A FRAGMENT.,
6243,A FRAGMENT.,"_Serv._ You rung, my lord?"
6244,A FRAGMENT.,

6246,A FRAGMENT.,"A beggar-woman, whom six weeks ago,"
6247,A FRAGMENT.,"As you remember, you admitted to me,"
6248,A FRAGMENT.,You may admit again if she returns. [_Exit Servant._
6249,A FRAGMENT.,
6250,A FRAGMENT.,Will she return? or did she die? I searched
6251,A FRAGMENT.,Newspaper columns through to find a trace

6258,A FRAGMENT.,Guilt evermore.’ I hear her voice again.
6259,A FRAGMENT.,"‘Once Guilt, but now’—I know not what it says;—"

6844,I,
6845,I,It was the afternoon; and the sports were now at the ending.
6846,I,"Long had the stone been put, tree cast, and thrown the hammer;"
6847,I,"Up the perpendicular hill, Sir Hector so called it,"
6848,I,"Eight stout gillies had run, with speed and agility wondrous;"
6849,I,Run too the course on the level had been; the leaping was over:
6850,I,"Last in the show of dress, a novelty recently added,"
6851,I,"Noble ladies their prizes adjudged for costume that was perfect,"
6852,I,"Turning the clansmen about, as they stood with upraised elbows;"
6853,I,"Bowing their eye-glassed brows, and fingering kilt and sporran."
6854,I,"It was four of the clock, and the sports were come to the ending,"
6855,I,Therefore the Oxford party went off to adorn for the dinner.
6856,I,"Be it recorded in song who was first, who last, in dressing."
6857,I,"Hope was first, black-tied, white-waistcoated, simple, His Honour;"
6858,I,For the postman made out he was heir to the earldom of Ilay
6859,I,"(Being the younger son of the younger brother, the Colonel),"
6860,I,"Treated him therefore with special respect; doffed bonnet, and ever"
6861,I,Called him His Honour: His Honour he therefore was at the cottage;
6862,I,"Always His Honour at least, sometimes the Viscount of Ilay."
6863,I,"Hope was first, His Honour, and next to His Honour the Tutor."
6864,I,"Still more plain the Tutor, the grave man, nicknamed Adam,"
6865,I,"White-tied, clerical, silent, with antique square-cut waistcoat"
6866,I,"Formal, unchanged, of black cloth, but with sense and feeling beneath it;"
6867,I,"Skilful in Ethics and Logic, in Pindar and Poets unrivalled;"
6868,I,"_Shady_ in Latin, said Lindsay, but _topping_ in Plays and Aldrich."
6869,I,"Somewhat more splendid in dress, in a waistcoat work of a lady,"
6870,I,"Lindsay succeeded; the lively, the cheery, cigar-loving Lindsay,"
6871,I,"Lindsay the ready of speech, the Piper, the Dialectician,"
6872,I,"This was his title from Adam because of the words he invented,"
6873,I,Who in three weeks had created a dialect new for the party;
6874,I,"This was his title from Adam, but mostly they called him the Piper."
6875,I,"Lindsay succeeded, the lively, the cheery, cigar-loving Lindsay."
6876,I,Hewson and Hobbes were down at the _matutine_ bathing; of course too
6877,I,"Arthur, the bather of bathers, _par excellence_, Audley by surname,"
6878,I,"Arthur they called him for love and for euphony; they had been bathing,"
6879,I,"Where in the morning was custom, where over a ledge of granite"
6880,I,"Into a granite basin the amber torrent descended,"
6881,I,"Only a step from the cottage, the road and larches between them."
6882,I,Hewson and Hobbes followed quick upon Adam; on them followed Arthur.
6883,I,"Airlie descended the last, effulgent as god of Olympus;"
6884,I,"Blue, perceptibly blue, was the coat that had white silk facings,"
6885,I,"Waistcoat blue, coral-buttoned, the white tie finely adjusted,"
6886,I,Coral moreover the studs on a shirt as of crochet of women:
6887,I,"When the fourwheel for ten minutes already had stood at the gateway,"
6888,I,"He, like a god, came leaving his ample Olympian chamber."
6889,I,And in the fourwheel they drove to the place of the clansmen’s meeting.
6890,I,So in the fourwheel they came; and Donald the innkeeper showed them
6891,I,Up to the barn where the dinner should be. Four tables were in it;
6892,I,"Two at the top and the bottom, a little upraised from the level,"
6893,I,"These for Chairman and Croupier, and gentry fit to be with them,"
6894,I,Two lengthways in the midst for keeper and gillie and peasant.
6895,I,"Here were clansmen many in kilt and bonnet assembled,"
6896,I,Keepers a dozen at least; the Marquis’s targeted gillies;
6897,I,"Pipers five or six, among them the young one, the drunkard;"
6898,I,"Many with silver brooches, and some with those brilliant crystals"
6899,I,Found amid granite-dust on the frosty scalp of the Cairn-Gorm;
6900,I,"But with snuff-boxes all, and all of them using the boxes."
6901,I,"Here too were Catholic Priest, and Established Minister standing"
6902,I,"Catholic Priest; for many still clung to the Ancient Worship,"
6903,I,And Sir Hector’s father himself had built them a chapel;
6904,I,"So stood Priest and Minister, near to each other, but silent,"
6905,I,"One to say grace before, the other after the dinner."
6906,I,"Hither anon too came the shrewd, ever-ciphering Factor,"
6907,I,"Hither anon the Attaché, the Guardsman mute and stately,"
6908,I,Hither from lodge and bothie in all the adjoining shootings
6909,I,"Members of Parliament many, forgetful of votes and bluebooks,"
6910,I,"Here, amid heathery hills, upon beast and bird of the forest"
6911,I,Venting the murderous spleen of the endless Railway Committee.
6912,I,"Hither the Marquis of Ayr, and Dalgarnish Earl and Croupier,"
6913,I,"And at their side, amid murmurs of welcome, long looked-for, himself too"
6914,I,"Eager, the grey, but boy-hearted Sir Hector, the Chief and the Chairman."
6915,I,"Then was the dinner served, and the Minister prayed for a blessing,"
6916,I,And to the viands before them with knife and with fork they beset them:
6917,I,"Venison, the red and the roe, with mutton; and grouse succeeding;"
6918,I,"Such was the feast, with whisky of course, and at top and bottom"
6919,I,"Small decanters of sherry, not overchoice, for the gentry."
6920,I,So to the viands before them with laughter and chat they beset them.
6921,I,"And, when on flesh and on fowl had appetite duly been sated,"
6922,I,Up rose the Catholic Priest and returned God thanks for the dinner.
6923,I,"Then on all tables were set black bottles of well-mixed toddy,"
6924,I,"And, with the bottles and glasses before them, they sat, digesting,"
6925,I,"Talking, enjoying, but chiefly awaiting the toasts and speeches."
6926,I,
6927,I,"Spare me, O great Recollection! for words to the task were unequal,"
6928,I,"Spare me, O mistress of Song! nor bid me remember minutely"
6929,I,All that was said and done o’er the well-mixed tempting toddy;
6930,I,"How were healths proposed and drunk ‘with all the honours,’"
6931,I,"Glasses and bonnets waving, and three-times-three thrice over,"
6932,I,"Queen, and Prince, and Army, and Landlords all, and Keepers;"
6933,I,"Bid me not, grammar defying, repeat from grammar-defiers"
6934,I,Long constructions strange and plusquam-Thucydidean;
6935,I,"Tell how, as sudden torrent in time of speat[7] in the mountain"
6936,I,"Hurries six ways at once, and takes at last to the roughest,"
6937,I,Or as the practised rider at Astley’s or Franconi’s
6938,I,"Skilfully, boldly bestrides many steeds at once in the gallop,"
6939,I,"Crossing from this to that, with one leg here, one yonder,"
6940,I,"So, less skilful, but equally bold, and wild as the torrent,"
6941,I,"All through sentences six at a time, unsuspecting of syntax,"
6942,I,Hurried the lively good-will and garrulous tale of Sir Hector.
6943,I,"Left to oblivion be it, the memory, faithful as ever,"
6944,I,"How the Marquis of Ayr, with wonderful gesticulation,"
6945,I,"Floundering on through game and mess-room recollections,"
6946,I,"Gossip of neighbouring forest, praise of targeted gillies,"
6947,I,"Anticipation of royal visit, skits at pedestrians,"
6948,I,"Swore he would never abandon his country, nor give up deer-stalking;"
6949,I,"How, too, more brief, and plainer, in spite of the Gaelic accent,"
6950,I,Highland peasants gave courteous answer to flattering nobles.
6951,I,Two orations alone the memorial song will render;
6952,I,"For at the banquet’s close spake thus the lively Sir Hector,"
6953,I,"Somewhat husky with praises exuberant, often repeated,"
6954,I,"Pleasant to him and to them, of the gallant Highland soldiers"
6955,I,"Whom he erst led in the fight;—something husky, but ready, though weary,"
6956,I,Up to them rose and spoke the grey but gladsome chieftain:—
6957,I,"Fill up your glasses, my friends, once more,—With all the honours!"
6958,I,"There was a toast I forgot, which our gallant Highland homes have"
6959,I,"Always welcomed the stranger, delighted, I may say, to see such"
6960,I,Fine young men at my table—My friends! are you ready? the Strangers.
6961,I,"Gentlemen, here are your healths,—and I wish you—With all the honours!"
6962,I,"So he said, and the cheers ensued, and all the honours,"
6963,I,"All our Collegians were bowed to, the Attaché detecting His Honour,"
6964,I,"Guardsman moving to Arthur, and Marquis sidling to Airlie,"
6965,I,And the small Piper below getting up and nodding to Lindsay.
6966,I,"But, while the healths were being drunk, was much tribulation and"
6967,I,"trouble,"
6968,I,"Nodding and beckoning across, observed of Attaché and Guardsman:"
6969,I,"Adam wouldn’t speak,—indeed it was certain he couldn’t;"
6970,I,"Hewson could, and would if they wished; Philip Hewson a poet,"
6971,I,"Hewson a radical hot, hating lords and scorning ladies,"
6972,I,"Silent mostly, but often reviling in fire and fury"
6973,I,"Feudal tenures, mercantile lords, competition and bishops,"
6974,I,"Liveries, armorial bearings, amongst other matters the Game-laws:"
6975,I,"He could speak, and was asked to by Adam; but Lindsay aloud cried,"
6976,I,"(Whisky was hot in his brain,) Confound it, no, not Hewson,"
6977,I,Ain’t he cock-sure to bring in his eternal political humbug?
6978,I,"However, so it must be, and after due pause of silence,"
6979,I,"Waving his hand to Lindsay, and smiling oddly to Adam,"
6980,I,Up to them rose and spoke the poet and radical Hewson:—
6981,I,"I am, I think, perhaps the most perfect stranger present."
6982,I,"I have not, as have some of my friends, in my veins some tincture,"
6983,I,"Some few ounces of Scottish blood; no, nothing like it."
6984,I,I am therefore perhaps the fittest to answer and thank you.
6985,I,"So I thank you, sir, for myself and for my companions,"
6986,I,"Heartily thank you all for this unexpected greeting,"
6987,I,"All the more welcome, as showing you do not account us intruders,"
6988,I,Are not unwilling to see the north and the south forgather.
6989,I,"And, surely, seldom have Scotch and English more thoroughly mingled;"
6990,I,"Scarcely with warmer hearts, and clearer feeling of manhood,"
6991,I,"Even in tourney, and foray, and fray, and regular battle."
6992,I,"Where the life and the strength came out in the tug and tussle,"
6993,I,"Scarcely, where man met man, and soul encountered with soul, as"
6994,I,"Close as do the bodies and twining limbs of the wrestlers,"
6995,I,"When for a final bout are a day’s two champions mated,—"
6996,I,"In the grand old times of bows, and bills, and claymores,"
6997,I,At the old Flodden-field—or Bannockburn—or Culloden.
6998,I,"—(And he paused a moment, for breath, and because of some cheering,)"
6999,I,"We are the better friends, I fancy, for that old fighting,"
7000,I,"Better friends, inasmuch as we know each other the better,"
7001,I,We can now shake hands without pretending or shuffling.
7002,I,"On this passage followed a great tornado of cheering,"
7003,I,"Tables were rapped, feet stamped, a glass or two got broken:"
7004,I,"He, ere the cheers died wholly away, and while still there was stamping,"
7005,I,"Added, in altered voice, with a smile, his doubtful conclusion."
7006,I,"I have, however, less claim than others perhaps to this honour,"
7007,I,"For, let me say, I am neither game-keeper, nor game-preserver."
7008,I,"So he said, and sat down, but his satire had not been taken."
7009,I,"Only the _men_, who were all on their legs as concerned in the thanking,"
7010,I,"Were a trifle confused, but mostly sat down without laughing;"
7011,I,"Lindsay alone, close-facing the chair, shook his fist at the speaker."
7012,I,"Only a Liberal member, away at the end of the table,"
7013,I,"Started, remembering sadly the cry of a coming election,"
7014,I,"Only the Attaché glanced at the Guardsman, who twirled his moustachio,"
7015,I,"Only the Marquis faced round, but, not quite clear of the meaning,"
7016,I,"Joined with the joyous Sir Hector, who lustily beat on the table."
7017,I,"And soon after the chairman arose, and the feast was over:"
7018,I,"Now should the barn be cleared and forthwith adorned for the dancing,"
7019,I,"And, to make way for this purpose, the Tutor and pupils retiring"
7020,I,Were by the chieftain addressed and invited to come to the castle.
7021,I,"But ere the door-way they quitted, a thin man clad as the Saxon,"
7022,I,"Trouser and cap and jacket of homespun blue, hand-woven,"
7023,I,"Singled out, and said with determined accent, to Hewson,"
7024,I,"Touching his arm: Young man, if ye pass through the Braes o’ Lochaber,"
7025,I,See by the loch-side ye come to the Bothie of Tober-na-vuolich.
7026,I,
7027,I,
7028,II,II
7029,II,
7030,II,"_Et certamen erat, Corydon cum Thyrside, magnum._"
7031,II,
7032,II,"Morn, in yellow and white, came broadening out from the mountains,"
7033,II,Long ere music and reel were hushed in the barn of the dancers.
7034,II,"Duly in _matutine_ bathed, before eight some two of the party,"
7035,II,"Where in the morning was custom, where over a ledge of granite"
7036,II,Into a granite basin the amber torrent descended.
7037,II,"There two plunges each took Philip and Arthur together,"
7038,II,"Duly in _matutine_ bathed, and read, and waited for breakfast:"
7039,II,"Breakfast commencing at nine, lingered lazily on to noon-day."
7040,II,Tea and coffee were there; a jug of water for Hewson;
7041,II,Tea and coffee; and four cold grouse upon the sideboard;
7042,II,"Gaily they talked, as they sat, some late and lazy at breakfast,"
7043,II,"Some professing a book, some smoking outside at the window."
7044,II,"By an aurora soft-pouring a still sheeny tide to the zenith,"
7045,II,"Hewson and Arthur, with Adam, had walked and got home by eleven;"
7046,II,Hope and the others had stayed till the round sun lighted them bedward.
7047,II,"They of the lovely aurora, but these of the lovelier women"
7048,II,"Spoke—of noble ladies and rustic girls, their partners."
7049,II,"Turned to them Hewson, the Chartist, the poet, the eloquent speaker."
7050,II,Sick of the very names of your Lady Augustas and Floras
7051,II,"Am I, as ever I was of the dreary botanical titles"
7052,II,"Of the exotic plants, their antitypes in the hot-house:"
7053,II,"Roses, violets, lilies for me! the out-of-door beauties;"
7054,II,"Meadow and woodland sweets, forget-me-nots and hearts-ease!"
7055,II,"Pausing awhile, he proceeded anon, for none made answer."
7056,II,"Oh, if our high-born girls knew only the grace, the attraction."
7057,II,"Labour, and labour alone, can add to the beauty of women,"
7058,II,"Truly the milliner’s trade would quickly, I think, be at discount,"
7059,II,"All the waste and loss in silk and satin be saved us,"
7060,II,Saved for purposes truly and widely productive——
7061,II,"That’s right,"
7062,II,"Take off your coat to it, Philip, cried Lindsay, outside in the garden,"
7063,II,"Take off your coat to it, Philip."
7064,II,"Well, then, said Hewson, resuming;"
7065,II,"Laugh if you please at my novel economy; listen to this, though;"
7066,II,"As for myself, and apart from economy wholly, believe me,"
7067,II,"Never I properly felt the relation between men and women,"
7068,II,"Though to the dancing-master I went perforce, for a quarter,"
7069,II,"Where, in dismal quadrille, were good-looking girls in abundance,"
7070,II,"Though, too, school-girl cousins were mine—a bevy of beauties—"
7071,II,"Never (of course you will laugh, but of course all the same I shall"
7072,II,"say it),"
7073,II,"Never, believe me, I knew of the feelings between men and women,"
7074,II,"Till in some village fields in holidays now getting stupid,"
7075,II,"One day sauntering ‘long and listless,’ as Tennyson has it,"
7076,II,"Long and listless strolling, ungainly in hobbadiboyhood,"
7077,II,"Chanced it my eye fell aside on a capless, bonnetless maiden,"
7078,II,Bending with three-pronged fork in a garden uprooting potatoes.
7079,II,"Was it the air? who can say? or herself, or the charm of the labour?"
7080,II,"But a new thing was in me; and longing delicious possessed me,"
7081,II,"Longing to take her and lift her, and put her away from her slaving."
7082,II,Was it embracing or aiding was most in my mind? hard question!
7083,II,"But a new thing was in me; I, too, was a youth among maidens:"
7084,II,Was it the air I who can say! but in part ’twas the charm of the labour.
7085,II,"Still, though a new thing was in me, the poets revealed themselves to me,"
7086,II,"And in my dreams by Miranda, her Ferdinand, often I wandered,"
7087,II,"Though all the fuss about girls, the giggling and toying and coying,"
7088,II,"Were not so strange as before, so incomprehensible purely;"
7089,II,"Still, as before (and as now), balls, dances, and evening parties,"
7090,II,"Shooting with bows, going shopping together, and hearing them singing,"
7091,II,"Dangling beside them, and turning the leaves on the dreary piano,"
7092,II,"Offering unneeded arms, performing dull farces of escort,"
7093,II,Seemed like a sort of unnatural up-in-the-air balloon-work
7094,II,"(Or what to me is as hateful, a riding about in a carriage),"
7095,II,"Utter removal from work, mother earth, and the objects of living."
7096,II,"Hungry and fainting for food, you ask me to join you in snapping—"
7097,II,"What but a pink-paper comfit, with motto romantic inside it?"
7098,II,"Wishing to stock me a garden, I’m sent to a table of nosegays;"
7099,II,"Better a crust of black bread than a mountain of paper confections,"
7100,II,"Better a daisy in earth than a dahlia cut and gathered,"
7101,II,Better a cowslip with root than a prize carnation without it.
7102,II,"That I allow, said Adam."
7103,II,"But he, with the bit in his teeth, scarce"
7104,II,"Breathed a brief moment, and hurried exultingly on with his rider,"
7105,II,"Far over hillock, and runnel, and bramble, away in the champaign,"
7106,II,"Snorting defiance and force, the white foam flecking his flanks, the"
7107,II,"Rein hanging loose to his neck, and head projecting before him."
7108,II,
7109,II,"Oh, if they knew and considered, unhappy ones! oh, could they see,"
7110,II,could
7111,II,"But for a moment discern, how the blood of true gallantry kindles,"
7112,II,"How the old knightly religion, the chivalry semi-quixotic"
7113,II,Stirs in the veins of a man at seeing some delicate woman
7114,II,"Serving him, toiling—for him, and the world; some tenderest girl, now"
7115,II,"Over-weighted, expectant, of him, is it? who shall, if only"
7116,II,"Duly her burden be lightened, not wholly removed from her, mind you"
7117,II,"Lightened if but by the love, the devotion man only can offer,"
7118,II,Grand on her pedestal rise as urn-bearing statue of Hellas;—
7119,II,"Oh, could they feel at such moments how man’s heart, as into Eden"
7120,II,"Carried anew, seems to see, like the gardener of earth uncorrupted,"
7121,II,"Eve from the hand of her Maker advancing, an help meet for him,"
7122,II,"Eve from his own flesh taken, a spirit restored to his spirit,"
7123,II,"Spirit but not spirit only, himself whatever himself is,"
7124,II,Unto the mystery’s end sole helpmate meet to be with him;—
7125,II,"Oh, if they saw it and knew it; we soon should see them abandon"
7126,II,"Boudoir, toilette, carriage, drawing-room, and ball-room,"
7127,II,"Satin for worsted exchange, gros-de-naples for plain linsey-woolsey,"
7128,II,"Sandals of silk for clogs, for health lackadaisical fancies!"
7129,II,"So, feel women, not dolls; so feel the sap of existence"
7130,II,Circulate up through their roots from the far-away centre of all things.
7131,II,Circulate up from the depths to the bud on the twig that is topmost!
7132,II,"Yes, we should see them delighted, delighted ourselves in the seeing,"
7133,II,"Bending with blue cotton gown skirted up over striped linsey-woolsey,"
7134,II,"Milking the kine in the field, like Rachel, watering cattle,"
7135,II,"Rachel, when at the well the predestined beheld and kissed her,"
7136,II,"Or, with pail upon head, like Dora beloved of Alexis,"
7137,II,"Comely, with well-poised pail over neck arching soft to the shoulders,"
7138,II,"Comely in gracefullest act, one arm uplifted to stay it,"
7139,II,Home from the river or pump moving stately and calm to the laundry;
7140,II,"Ay, doing household work, as many sweet girls I have looked at,"
7141,II,"Needful household work, which some one, after all, must do,"
7142,II,"Needful, graceful therefore, as washing, cooking, and scouring,"
7143,II,"Or, if you please, with the fork in the garden uprooting potatoes.—"
7144,II,"Or,—high-kilted perhaps, cried Lindsay, at last successful,"
7145,II,"Lindsay this long time swelling with scorn and pent-up fury,"
7146,II,"Or high-kilted perhaps, as once at Dundee I saw them,"
7147,II,"Petticoats up to the knees, or even, it might be, above them,"
7148,II,Matching their lily-white legs with the clothes that they trod in the
7149,II,wash-tub!
7150,II,"Laughter ensued at this; and seeing the Tutor embarrassed,"
7151,II,"It was from them, I suppose, said Arthur, smiling sedately,"
7152,II,"Lindsay learnt the tune we all have learnt from Lindsay,"
7153,II,"_For oh, he was a roguey, the Piper o’ Dundee_."
7154,II,"Laughter ensued again; and the Tutor, recovering slowly,"
7155,II,"Said, Are not these perhaps as doubtful as other attractions?"
7156,II,"There is a truth in your view, but I think extremely distorted;"
7157,II,"Still there is a truth, I own, I understand you entirely."
7158,II,"While the Tutor was gathering his purposes, Arthur continued,"
7159,II,"Is not all this the same that one hears at common-room breakfasts,"
7160,II,"Or perhaps Trinity wines, about Gothic buildings and Beauty?"
7161,II,"And with a start from the sofa came Hobbes; with a cry from the sofa,"
7162,II,"Where he was laid, the great Hobbes, contemplative, corpulent, witty,"
7163,II,"Author forgotten and silent of currentest phrases and fancies,"
7164,II,"Mute and exuberant by turns, a fountain at intervals playing,"
7165,II,"Mute and abstracted, or strong and abundant as rain in the tropics;"
7166,II,Studious; careless of dress; inobservant; by smooth persuasions
7167,II,"Lately decoyed into kilt on example of Hope and the Piper,"
7168,II,"Hope an Antinoüs mere, Hyperion of calves the Piper."
7169,II,"Beautiful! cried he up-leaping, analogy perfect to madness!"
7170,II,"O inexhaustible source of thought, shall I call it, or fancy!"
7171,II,"Wonderful spring, at whose touch doors fly, what a vista disclosing!"
7172,II,"Exquisite germ; Ah no, crude fingers shall not soil thee;"
7173,II,"Rest, lovely pearl, in my brain, and slowly mature in the oyster."
7174,II,"While at the exquisite pearl they were laughing and corpulent oyster,"
7175,II,"Ah, could they only be taught, he resumed, by a Pugin of women,"
7176,II,"How even churning and washing, the dairy, the scullery duties,"
7177,II,"Wait but a touch to redeem and convert them to charms and attractions,"
7178,II,"Scrubbing requires for true grace but frank and artistical handling,"
7179,II,And the removal of slops to be ornamentally treated.
7180,II,"Philip who speaks like a book, (retiring and pausing he added,)"
7181,II,"Philip, here, who speaks—like a folio say’st thou, Piper?"
7182,II,"Philip shall write us a book, a Treatise upon _The Laws of_"
7183,II,_Architectural Beauty in Application to Women_;
7184,II,"Illustrations, of course, and a Parker’s Glossary pendent."
7185,II,Where shall in specimen seen be the sculliony stumpy-columnar
7186,II,"(Which to a reverent taste is perhaps the most moving of any),"
7187,II,"Rising to grace of true woman in English the Early and Later,"
7188,II,"Charming us still in fulfilling the Richer and Loftier stages,"
7189,II,"Lost, ere we end, in the Lady-Debased and the Lady-Flamboyant:"
7190,II,Whence why in satire and spite too merciless onward pursue her
7191,II,"Hither to hideous close, Modern-Florid, modern-fine-lady?"
7192,II,"No, I will leave it to you, my Philip, my Pugin of women."
7193,II,"Leave it to Arthur, said Adam, to think of, and not to play with."
7194,II,"You are young, you know, he said, resuming, to Philip,"
7195,II,"You are young, he proceeded, with something of fervour to Hewson."
7196,II,You are a boy; when you grow to a man you’ll find things alter.
7197,II,"You will then seek only the good, will scorn the attractive,"
7198,II,"Scorn all mere cosmetics, as now of rank and fashion,"
7199,II,"Delicate hands, and wealth, so then of poverty also,"
7200,II,"Poverty truly attractive, more truly, I bear you witness."
7201,II,"Good, wherever it’s found, you will choose, be it humble or stately,"
7202,II,"Happy if only you find, and finding do not lose it."
7203,II,"Yes, we must seek what is good, it always and it only;"
7204,II,"Not indeed absolute good, good for us, as is said in the Ethics,"
7205,II,"That which is good for ourselves, our proper selves, our best selves."
7206,II,"Ah, you have much to learn, we can’t know all things at twenty."
7207,II,"Partly you rest on truth, old truth, the duty of Duty,"
7208,II,"Partly on error, you long for equality."
7209,II,"Ay, cried the Piper,"
7210,II,"That’s what it is, that confounded _égalité_, French manufacture,"
7211,II,"He is the same as the Chartist who spoke at a meeting in Ireland,"
7212,II,"_What, and is not one man, fellow-men, as good as another?_"
7213,II,"_Faith_, replied Pat, _and a deal better too_!"
7214,II,So rattled the Piper:
7215,II,"But undisturbed in his tenor, the Tutor."
7216,II,Partly in error
7217,II,"Seeking equality, _is not one woman as good as another_?"
7218,II,"I with the Irishman answer, _Yes, better too_; the poorer"
7219,II,"Better full oft than richer, than loftier better the lower,"
7220,II,"Irrespective of wealth and of poverty, pain and enjoyment,"
7221,II,"Women all have their duties, the one as well as the other;"
7222,II,Are all duties alike? Do all alike fulfil them?
7223,II,"However noble the dream of equality, mark you, Philip,"
7224,II,"Nowhere equality reigns in all the world of creation,"
7225,II,"Star is not equal to star, nor blossom the same as blossom;"
7226,II,"Herb is not equal to herb, any more than planet to planet."
7227,II,"There is a glory of daisies, a glory again of carnations;"
7228,II,"Were the carnation wise, in gay parterre by greenhouse,"
7229,II,"Should it decline to accept the nurture the gardener gives it,"
7230,II,"Should it refuse to expand to sun and genial summer,"
7231,II,"Simply because the field-daisy that grows in the grass-plat beside it,"
7232,II,"Cannot, for some cause or other, develop and be a carnation?"
7233,II,Would not the daisy itself petition its scrupulous neighbour?
7234,II,"Up, grow, bloom, and forget me; be beautiful even to proudness,"
7235,II,E’en for the sake of myself and other poor daisies like me.
7236,II,"Education and manners, accomplishments and refinements,"
7237,II,"Waltz, peradventure, and polka, the knowledge of music and drawing"
7238,II,"All these things are Nature’s, to Nature dear and precious,"
7239,II,"We have all something to do, man, woman alike, I own it;"
7240,II,"We all have something to do, and in my judgment should do it"
7241,II,"In our station; not thinking about it, but not disregarding;"
7242,II,"Holding it, not for enjoyment, but simply because we are in it."
7243,II,"Ah! replied Philip, Alas! the noted phrase of the Prayer-book,"
7244,II,"_Doing our duty in that state of life to which God has called us_,"
7245,II,"Seems to me always to mean, when the little rich boys say it,"
7246,II,"Standing in velvet frock by mamma’s brocaded flounces,"
7247,II,"Eyeing her gold-fastened book and the watch and chain at her bosom,"
7248,II,"Seems to me always to mean, Eat, drink, and never mind others."
7249,II,"Nay, replied Adam, smiling, so far your economy leads me,"
7250,II,Velvet and gold and brocade are nowise to my fancy.
7251,II,"Nay, he added, believe me, I like luxurious living"
7252,II,"Even as little as you, and grieve in my soul not seldom,"
7253,II,"More for the rich indeed than the poor, who are not so guilty."
7254,II,"So the discussion closed; and, said Arthur, Now it is my turn,"
7255,II,How will my argument please you? To-morrow we start on our travel.
7256,II,"And took up Hope the chorus,"
7257,II,To-morrow we start on our travel.
7258,II,"Lo, the weather is golden, the weather-glass, say they, rising;"
7259,II,Four weeks here have we read; four weeks will we read hereafter;
7260,II,Three weeks hence will return and think of classes and classics.
7261,II,"Fare ye well, meantime, forgotten, unnamed, undreamt of,"
7262,II,"History, Science, and Poets! lo, deep in dustiest cupboard,"
7263,II,"Thookydid, Oloros’ son, Halimoosian, here lieth buried!"
7264,II,"Slumber in Liddell-and-Scott, O musical chaff of old Athens,"
7265,II,"Dishes, and fishes, bird, beast, and sesquipedalian blackguard!"
7266,II,"Sleep, weary ghosts, be at peace and abide in your lexicon-limbo!"
7267,II,"Sleep, as in lava for ages your Herculanean kindred,"
7268,II,"Sleep, for aught that I care, ‘the sleep that knows no waking,’"
7269,II,"Æschylus, Sophocles, Homer, Herodotus, Pindar, and Plato."
7270,II,Three weeks hence be it time to exhume our dreary classics.
7271,II,"And in the chorus joined Lindsay, the Piper, the Dialectician,"
7272,II,Three weeks hence we return to the _shop_ and the _wash-hand-stand basin_
7273,II,(These are the Piper’s names for the bathing-place and the cottage).
7274,II,Three weeks hence unbury _Thicksides_ and _hairy_ Aldrich.
7275,II,"But the Tutor inquired, the grave man, nick-named Adam,"
7276,II,"Who are they that go, and when do they promise returning?"
7277,II,"And a silence ensued, and the Tutor himself continued,"
7278,II,"Airlie remains, I presume, he continued, and Hobbes and Hewson."
7279,II,"Answer was made him by Philip, the poet, the eloquent speaker:"
7280,II,"Airlie remains, I presume, was the answer, and Hobbes, peradventure;"
7281,II,"Tarry let Airlie May-fairly, and Hobbes, brief-kilted hero,"
7282,II,"Tarry let Hobbes in kilt, and Airlie ‘abide in his breeches;’"
7283,II,"Tarry let these, and read, four Pindars apiece an’ it like them!"
7284,II,"Weary of reading am I, and weary of walks prescribed us;"
7285,II,"Weary of Ethic and Logic, of Rhetoric yet more weary,"
7286,II,"Eager to range over heather unfettered of gillie and marquis,"
7287,II,"I will away with the rest, and bury my dismal classics."
7288,II,"And to the Tutor rejoining, Be mindful; you go up at Easter,"
7289,II,"This was the answer returned by Philip, the Pugin of women."
7290,II,"Good are the Ethics I wis; good absolute, not for me, though;"
7291,II,"Good, too, Logic, of course; in itself, but not in fine weather."
7292,II,"Three weeks hence, with the rain, to Prudence, Temperance, Justice,"
7293,II,"Virtues Moral and Mental, with Latin prose included;"
7294,II,Three weeks hence we return to cares of classes and classics.
7295,II,"I will away with the rest, and bury my dismal classics."
7296,II,"But the Tutor inquired, the grave man, nick-named Adam,"
7297,II,"Where do you mean to go, and whom do you mean to visit?"
7298,II,"And he was answered by Hope, the Viscount, His Honour, of Ilay."
7299,II,"Kitcat, a Trinity _coach_, has a party at Drumnadrochet,"
7300,II,"Up on the side of Loch Ness, in the beautiful valley of Urquhart;"
7301,II,"Mainwaring says they will lodge us, and feed us, and give us a lift too"
7302,II,Only they talk ere long to remove to Glenmorison. Then at
7303,II,"Castleton, high in Braemar, strange home, with his earliest party,"
7304,II,"Harrison, fresh from the schools, has James and Jones and Lauder."
7305,II,"Thirdly, a Cambridge man I know, Smith, a senior wrangler,"
7306,II,With a mathematical score hangs-out at Inverary.
7307,II,"Finally, too, from the kilt and the sofa said Hobbes in conclusion,"
7308,II,"Finally, Philip must hunt for that home of the probable poacher,"
7309,II,"Hid in the braes of Lochaber, the Bothie of _What-did-he-call-it_."
7310,II,"Hopeless of you and of us, of gillies and marquises hopeless,"
7311,II,"Weary of Ethic and Logic, of Rhetoric yet more weary,"
7312,II,"There shall he, smit by the charm of a lovely potato-uprooter,"
7313,II,Study the question of sex in the Bothie of _What-did-he-call-it_.
7314,II,
7315,II,
7316,III,III
7317,III,
7318,III,_Namque canebat uti——_
7319,III,
7320,III,So in the golden morning they parted and went to the westward.
7321,III,And in the cottage with Airlie and Hobbes remained the Tutor;
7322,III,"Reading nine hours a day with the Tutor, Hobbes and Airlie;"
7323,III,"One between bathing and breakfast, and six before it was dinner"
7324,III,"(Breakfast at eight, at four, after bathing again, the dinner),"
7325,III,"Finally, two after walking and tea, from nine to eleven."
7326,III,Airlie and Adam at evening their quiet stroll together
7327,III,"Took on the terrace-road, with the western hills before them;"
7328,III,"Hobbes, only rarely a third, now and then in the cottage remaining,"
7329,III,"E’en after dinner, eupeptic, would rush yet again to his reading;"
7330,III,"Other times, stung by the œstrum of some swift-working conception,"
7331,III,"Ranged, tearing on in his fury, an Io-cow through the mountains,"
7332,III,"Heedless of scenery, heedless of bogs, and of perspiration,"
7333,III,"On the high peaks, unwitting, the hares and ptarmigan starting."
7334,III,"And the three weeks past, the three weeks, three days over,"
7335,III,"Nither letter had come, nor casual tidings any,"
7336,III,"And the pupils grumbled, the Tutor became uneasy,"
7337,III,"And in the golden weather they wondered, and watched to the westward."
7338,III,"There is a stream (I name not its name, lest inquisitive tourist"
7339,III,"Hunt it, and make it a lion, and get it at last into guide-books),"
7340,III,"Springing far off from a loch unexplored in the folds of great mountains,"
7341,III,"Falling two miles through rowan and stunted alder, enveloped"
7342,III,"Then for four more in a forest of pine, where broad and ample"
7343,III,"Spreads, to convey it, the glen with heathery slopes on both sides:"
7344,III,"Broad and fair the stream, with occasional falls and narrows;"
7345,III,"But, where the glen of its course approaches the vale of the river,"
7346,III,"Met and blocked by a huge interposing mass of granite,"
7347,III,"Scarce by a channel deep-cut, raging up, and raging onward,"
7348,III,Forces its flood through a passage so narrow a lady would step it.
7349,III,"There, across the great rocky wharves, a wooden bridge goes,"
7350,III,"Carrying a path to the forest; below, three hundred yards, say,"
7351,III,"Lower in level some twenty-five feet, through flats of shingle,"
7352,III,Stepping-stones and a cart-track cross in the open valley.
7353,III,But in the interval here the boiling pent-up water
7354,III,"Frees itself by a final descent, attaining a basin,"
7355,III,"Ten feet wide and eighteen long, with whiteness and fury"
7356,III,"Occupied partly, but mostly pellucid, pure, a mirror;"
7357,III,Beautiful there for the colour derived from green rocks under;
7358,III,"Beautiful, most of all, where beads of foam uprising"
7359,III,"Mingle their clouds of white with the delicate hue of the stillness,"
7360,III,"Cliff over cliff for its sides, with rowan and pendent birch boughs,"
7361,III,"Here it lies, unthought of above at the bridge and pathway,"
7362,III,Still more enclosed from below by wood and rocky projection.
7363,III,"You are shut in, left alone with yourself and perfection of water,"
7364,III,"Hid on all sides, left alone with yourself and the goddess of bathing."
7365,III,"Here, the pride of the plunger, you stride the fall and clear it;"
7366,III,"Here, the delight of the bather, you roll in beaded sparklings,"
7367,III,Here into pure green depth drop down from lofty ledges.
7368,III,"Hither, a month agone, they had come, and discovered it; hither"
7369,III,"(Long a design, but long unaccountably left unaccomplished),"
7370,III,"Leaving the well-known bridge and pathway above to the forest,"
7371,III,"Turning below from the track of the carts over stone and shingle,"
7372,III,"Piercing a wood, and skirting a narrow and natural causeway"
7373,III,"Under the rocky wall that hedges the bed of the streamlet,"
7374,III,"Rounded a craggy point, and saw on a sudden before them"
7375,III,"Slabs of rock, and a tiny beach, and perfection of water,"
7376,III,"Picture-like beauty, seclusion sublime, and the goddess of bathing."
7377,III,"There they bathed, of course, and Arthur, the Glory of headers,"
7378,III,"Leapt from the ledges with Hope, he twenty feet, he thirty;"
7379,III,"There, overbold, great Hobbes from a ten-foot height descended,"
7380,III,"Prone, as a quadruped, prone with hands and feet protending;"
7381,III,"There in the sparkling champagne, ecstatic, they shrieked and shouted."
7382,III,"‘Hobbes’s gutter’ the Piper entitles the spot, profanely,"
7383,III,"Hope ‘the Glory’ would have, after Arthur, the Glory of headers:"
7384,III,"But, for before they departed, in shy and fugitive reflex,"
7385,III,Here in the eddies and there did the splendour of Jupiter glimmer;
7386,III,"Adam adjudged it the name of Hesperus, star of the evening."
7387,III,"Hither, to Hesperus, now, the star of evening above them,"
7388,III,Come in their lonelier walk the pupils twain and Tutor;
7389,III,"Turned from the track of the carts, and passing the stone and shingle,"
7390,III,"Piercing the wood, and skirting the stream by the natural causeway,"
7391,III,"Rounded the craggy point, and now at their ease looked up; and"
7392,III,"Lo, on the rocky ledge, regardant, the Glory of headers,"
7393,III,"Lo, on the beach, expecting the plunge, not cigarless, the Piper,—"
7394,III,"And they looked, and wondered, incredulous, looking yet once more."
7395,III,"Yes, it was he, on the ledge, bare-limbed, an Apollo, down-gazing,"
7396,III,"Eyeing one moment the beauty, the life, ere he flung himself in it,"
7397,III,Eyeing through eddying green waters the green-tinting floor underneath
7398,III,"them,"
7399,III,"Eyeing the bead on the surface, the bead, like a cloud rising to it,"
7400,III,"Drinking-in, deep in his soul, the beautiful hue and the clearness,"
7401,III,"Arthur, the shapely, the brave, the unboasting, the Glory of headers;"
7402,III,"Yes, and with fragrant weed, by his knapsack, spectator and critic,"
7403,III,"Seated on slab by the margin, the Piper, the Cloud-compeller."
7404,III,"Yes, they were come; were restored to the party, its grace and its"
7405,III,"gladness,"
7406,III,"Yes, were here, as of old; the light-giving orb of the household,"
7407,III,"Arthur, the shapely, the tranquil, the strength-and-contentment"
7408,III,"diffusing,"
7409,III,"In the pure presence of whom none could quarrel long, nor be pettish,"
7410,III,"And, the gay fountain of mirth, their dearly beloved of Pipers;"
7411,III,"Yes, they were come, were here: but Hewson and Hope—where they then?"
7412,III,"Are they behind, travel-sore, or ahead, going straight, by the pathway?"
7413,III,"And from his seat and cigar spoke the Piper, the Cloud-compeller."
7414,III,"Hope with the uncle abideth for shooting. Ah me, were I with him!"
7415,III,"Ah, good boy that I am, to have stuck to my word and my reading!"
7416,III,"Good, good boy to be here, far away, who might be at Balloch!"
7417,III,"Only one day to have stayed who might have been welcome for seven,"
7418,III,Seven whole days in castle and forest—gay in the mazy
7419,III,"Moving, imbibing the rosy, and pointing a gun at the horny!"
7420,III,"And the Tutor impatient, expectant, interrupted."
7421,III,"Hope with the uncle, and Hewson—with him? or where have you left him?"
7422,III,"And from his seat and cigar spoke the Piper, the Cloud-compeller."
7423,III,"Hope with the uncle, and Hewson—Why, Hewson we left in Rannoch,"
7424,III,"By the lochside and the pines, in a farmer’s house,—reflecting—"
7425,III,"Helping to shear,[8] and dry clothes, and bring in peat from the"
7426,III,peat-stack.
7427,III,"And the Tutor’s countenance fell; perplexed, dumb-foundered"
7428,III,"Stood he,—slow and with pain disengaging jest from earnest."
7429,III,"He is not far from home, said Arthur from the water,"
7430,III,"He will be with us to-morrow, at latest, or the next day."
7431,III,And he was even more reassured by the Piper’s rejoinder.
7432,III,"Can he have come by the mail, and have got to the cottage before us?"
7433,III,"So to the cottage they went, and Philip was not at the cottage;"
7434,III,"But by the mail was a letter from Hope, who himself was to follow."
7435,III,"Two whole days and nights succeeding brought not Philip,"
7436,III,Two whole days and nights exhausted not question and story.
7437,III,"For it was told, the Piper narrating, corrected of Arthur,"
7438,III,"Often by word corrected, more often by smile and motion,"
7439,III,"How they had been to Iona, to Staffa, to Skye, to Culloden,"
7440,III,"Seen Loch Awe, Loch Tay, Loch Fyne, Loch Ness, Loch Arkaig,"
7441,III,"Been up Ben-nevis, Ben-more, Ben-cruachan, Ben-muick-dhui;"
7442,III,"How they had walked, and eaten, and drunken, and slept in kitchens"
7443,III,"Slept upon floors of kitchens, and tasted the real Glenlivat,"
7444,III,"Walked up perpendicular hills, and also down them,"
7445,III,"Hither and thither had been, and this and that had witnessed,"
7446,III,"Left not a thing to be done, and had not a copper remaining."
7447,III,"For it was told withal, he telling, and he correcting,"
7448,III,"How in the race they had run, and beaten the gillies of Rannoch,"
7449,III,"How in forbidden glens, in Mar and midmost Athol,"
7450,III,"Philip insisting hotly, and Arthur and Hope compliant,"
7451,III,"They had defied the keepers; the Piper alone protesting,"
7452,III,"Liking the fun, it was plain, in his heart, but tender of game-law;"
7453,III,"Yea, too, in Meäly glen, the heart of Lochiel’s fair forest,"
7454,III,"Where Scotch firs are darkest and amplest, and intermingle"
7455,III,"Grandly with rowan and ash—in Mar you have no ashes,"
7456,III,"There the pine is alone, or relieved by the birch and the alder—"
7457,III,"How in Meäly glen, while stags were starting before, they"
7458,III,Made the watcher believe they were guests from Achnacarry.
7459,III,"And there was told moreover, he telling, the other correcting,"
7460,III,"Often by word, more often by mute significant motion,"
7461,III,"Much of the Cambridge _coach_ and his pupils at Inverary,"
7462,III,"Huge barbarian pupils, Expanded in Infinite Series,"
7463,III,Firing-off signal guns (great scandal) from window to window
7464,III,"(For they were lodging perforce in distant and numerous houses),"
7465,III,"Signals, when, one retiring, another should go to the Tutor:—"
7466,III,"Much too of Kitcat, of course, and the party at Drumnadrochet,"
7467,III,"Mainwaring, Foley, and Fraser, their idleness horrid and dog-cart;"
7468,III,"Drumnadrochet was _seedy_, Glenmorison _adequate_, but at"
7469,III,"Castleton, high in Braemar, were the _clippingest_ places for bathing;"
7470,III,"One by the bridge in the village, indecent, the _Town Hall_ christened."
7471,III,"Where had Lauder howbeit been bathing, and Harrison also,"
7472,III,"Harrison even, the Tutor; another like Hesperus here, and"
7473,III,"Up the water of Eye, half-a-dozen at least, all _stunners_."
7474,III,"And it was told, the Piper narrating and Arthur correcting,"
7475,III,"Colouring he, dilating, magniloquent, glorying in picture,"
7476,III,"He to a matter-of-fact still softening, paring, abating,"
7477,III,"He to the great might-have-been upsoaring, sublime and ideal,"
7478,III,"He to the merest it-was restricting, diminishing, dwarfing,"
7479,III,"River to streamlet reducing, and fall to slope subduing:"
7480,III,"So was it told, the Piper narrating, corrected of Arthur,"
7481,III,"How under Linn of Dee, where over rocks, between rocks,"
7482,III,"Freed from prison the river comes, pouring, rolling, rushing,"
7483,III,"Then at a sudden descent goes sliding, gliding, unbroken,"
7484,III,"Falling, sliding, gliding, in narrow space collected,"
7485,III,"Save for a ripple at last, a sheeted descent unbroken,—"
7486,III,"How to the element offering their bodies, downshooting the fall, they"
7487,III,Mingled themselves with the flood and the force of imperious water.
7488,III,"And it was told too, Arthur narrating, the Piper correcting,"
7489,III,"How, as one comes to the level, the weight of the downward impulse"
7490,III,"Carries the head under water, delightful, unspeakable; how the"
7491,III,"Piper, here ducked and blinded, got stray, and borne-off by the current"
7492,III,"Wounded his lily-white thighs, below, at the craggy corner."
7493,III,"And it was told, the Piper resuming, corrected of Arthur,"
7494,III,"More by word than motion, change ominous, noted of Adam,"
7495,III,"How at the floating-bridge of Laggan, one morning at sunrise,"
7496,III,"Came, in default of the ferryman, out of her bed a brave lassie;"
7497,III,"And as Philip and she together were turning the handles,"
7498,III,Winding the chain by which the boat works over the water
7499,III,"Hands intermingled with hands, and at last, as they stepped from the"
7500,III,"boatie,"
7501,III,"Turning about, they saw lips also mingle with lips; but"
7502,III,That was flatly denied and loudly exclaimed at by Arthur:
7503,III,"How at the General’s hut, the Inn by the Foyers Fall, where"
7504,III,"Over the loch looks at you the summit of Méalfourvónie,"
7505,III,"How here too he was hunted at morning, and found in the kitchen"
7506,III,"Watching the porridge being made, pronouncing them smoked for certain,"
7507,III,"Watching the porridge being made, and asking the lassie that made them"
7508,III,"What was the Gaelic for _girl_, and what was the Gaelic for _pretty_;"
7509,III,"How in confusion he shouldered his knapsack, yet blushingly stammered,"
7510,III,"Waving a hand to the lassie, that blushingly bent o’er the porridge,"
7511,III,"Something outlandish—_Slan_-something, _Slan leat_, he believed, _Caleg"
7512,III,Looach_—
7513,III,"That was the Gaelic, it seemed, for ‘I bid you good-bye, bonnie lassie;"
7514,III,"Arthur admitted it true, not of Philip, but of the Piper."
7515,III,"And it was told by the Piper, while Arthur looked out at the window,"
7516,III,How in thunder and in rain—it is wetter far to the westward—
7517,III,"Thunder and rain and wind, losing heart and road, they were welcomed,"
7518,III,"Welcomed, and three days detained at a farm by the lochside of Rannoch;"
7519,III,"How in the three days’ detention was Philip observed to be smitten,"
7520,III,"Smitten by golden-haired Katie, the youngest and comeliest daughter;"
7521,III,"Was he not seen, even Arthur observed it, from breakfast to bedtime,"
7522,III,"Following her motions with eyes ever brightening, softening ever?"
7523,III,"Did he not fume, fret, and fidget to find her stand waiting at table?"
7524,III,"Was he not one mere St. Vitus’ dance, when he saw her at nightfall"
7525,III,"Go through the rain to fetch peat, through beating rain to the"
7526,III,peat-stack?
7527,III,"How too a dance, as it happened, was given by Grant of Glenurchie,"
7528,III,And with the farmer they went as the farmer’s guests to attend it;
7529,III,"Philip stayed dancing till daylight,—and evermore with Katie;"
7530,III,"How the whole next afternoon he was with her away in the shearing,[9]"
7531,III,And the next morning ensuing was found in the ingle beside her
7532,III,"Kneeling, picking the peats from her apron,—blowing together,"
7533,III,"Both, between laughing, with lips distended, to kindle the embers;"
7534,III,"Lips were so near to lips, one living cheek to another,—"
7535,III,"Though, it was true, he was shy, very shy,—yet it wasn’t in nature,"
7536,III,"Wasn’t in nature, the Piper averred, there shouldn’t be kissing;"
7537,III,"So when at noon they had packed up the things, and proposed to be"
7538,III,"starting,"
7539,III,"Philip professed he was lame, would leave in the morning and follow;"
7540,III,"Follow he did not; do burns, when you go up a glen, follow after?"
7541,III,"Follow, he had not, nor left; do needles leave the loadstone?"
7542,III,"Nay, they had turned after starting, and looked through the trees at"
7543,III,"the corner,"
7544,III,"Lo, on the rocks by the lake there he was, the lassie beside him,"
7545,III,"Lo, there he was, stooping by her, and helping with stones from the water"
7546,III,Safe in the wind to keep down the clothes she would spread for the
7547,III,drying.
7548,III,"There they had left him, and there, if Katie was there, was Philip,"
7549,III,"There drying clothes, making fires, making love, getting on too by"
7550,III,"this time,"
7551,III,"Though he was shy, so exceedingly shy."
7552,III,"You may say so, said Arthur,"
7553,III,"For the first time they had known with a peevish intonation,—"
7554,III,"Did not the Piper himself flirt more in a single evening,"
7555,III,"Namely, with Janet the elder, than Philip in all our sojourn?"
7556,III,"Philip had stayed, it was true; the Piper was loth to depart too,"
7557,III,Harder his parting from Janet than e’en from the keeper at Balloch;
7558,III,And it was certain that Philip was lame.
7559,III,"Yes, in his excuses,"
7560,III,"Answered the Piper, indeed!—"
7561,III,"But tell me, said Hobbes interposing,"
7562,III,Did you not say she was seen every day in her beauty and bedgown
7563,III,"Doing plain household work, as washing, cooking, scouring?"
7564,III,How could he help but love her? nor lacked there perhaps the attraction
7565,III,"That, in a blue cotton print tucked up over striped linsey-woolsey,"
7566,III,"Barefoot, barelegged, he beheld her, with arms bare up to the elbows,"
7567,III,Bending with fork in her hand in a garden uprooting potatoes?
7568,III,"Is not Katie as Rachel, and is not Philip a Jacob?"
7569,III,"Truly Jacob, supplanting a hairy Highland Esau?"
7570,III,"Shall he not, love-entertained, feed sheep for the Laban of Rannoch?"
7571,III,"Patriarch happier he, the long servitude ended of wooing,"
7572,III,If when he wake in the morning he find not a Leah beside him!
7573,III,"But the Tutor inquired, who had bit his lip to bleeding,"
7574,III,How far off is the place? who will guide me thither to-morrow?
7575,III,
7576,III,"But by the mail, ere the morrow, came Hope, and brought new tidings;"
7577,III,"Round by Rannoch had come, and Philip was not at Rannoch;"
7578,III,"He had left at noon, an hour ago."
7579,III,With the lassie?
7580,III,With her? the Piper exclaimed. Undoubtedly! By great Jingo’
7581,III,"And upon that he arose, slapping both his thighs like a hero,"
7582,III,"Partly for emphasis only, to mark his conviction, but also"
7583,III,"Part in delight at the fun, and the joy of eventful living."
7584,III,"Hope couldn’t tell him, of course, but thought it improbable wholly;"
7585,III,"Janet, the Piper’s friend, he had seen, and she didn’t say so,"
7586,III,"Though she asked a good deal about Philip, and where he was gone to;"
7587,III,"One odd thing, by the bye, he continued, befell me while with her;"
7588,III,"Standing beside her, I saw a girl pass; I thought I had seen her,"
7589,III,"Somewhat remarkable-looking, elsewhere; and asked what her name was;"
7590,III,"Elspie Mackaye, was the answer, the daughter of David! she’s stopping"
7591,III,"Just above here, with her uncle. And David Mackaye, where lives he?"
7592,III,"It’s away west, she said; they call it Tober-na vuolich."
7593,III,
7594,III,
7595,IV,IV
7596,IV,
7597,IV,"_Ut vidi, ut perii, ut me malus abstulit error._"
7598,IV,
7599,IV,So in the golden weather they waited. But Philip returned not.
7600,IV,Sunday six days thence a letter arrived in his writing.—
7601,IV,"But, O Muse, that encompassest Earth like the ambient ether,"
7602,IV,"Swifter than steamer or railway or magical missive electric,"
7603,IV,"Belting like Ariel the sphere with the star-like trail of thy travel,"
7604,IV,"Thou with thy Poet, to mortals mere post-office second-hand knowledge"
7605,IV,"Leaving, wilt seek in the moorland of Rannoch the wandering hero."
7606,IV,"There is it, there, or in lofty Lochaber, where, silent upheaving,"
7607,IV,"Heaving from ocean to sky, and under snow-winds of September,"
7608,IV,"Visibly whitening at morn to darken by noon in the shining,"
7609,IV,Rise on their mighty foundations the brethren huge of Ben-nevis?
7610,IV,"There, or westward away, where roads are unknown to Loch Nevish,"
7611,IV,And the great peaks look abroad over Skye to the westernmost islands?
7612,IV,There is it? there? or there? we shall find our wandering hero?
7613,IV,"Here, in Badenoch, here, in Lochaber anon, in Lochiel, in"
7614,IV,"Knoydart, Moydart, Morrer, Ardgower, and Ardnamurchan,"
7615,IV,Here I see him and here: I see him; anon I lose him!
7616,IV,"Even as cloud passing subtly unseen from mountain to mountain,"
7617,IV,"Leaving the crest of Ben-more to be palpable next on Ben-vohrlich,"
7618,IV,"Or like to hawk of the hill which ranges and soars in its hunting,"
7619,IV,"Seen and unseen by turns, now here, now in ether eludent."
7620,IV,"Wherefore, as cloud of Ben-more or hawk over-ranging the mountains,"
7621,IV,"Wherefore in Badenoch drear, in lofty Lochaber, Lochiel, and"
7622,IV,"Knoydart, Moydart, Morrer, Ardgower, and Ardnamurchan,"
7623,IV,"Wandereth he who should either with Adam be studying logic,"
7624,IV,Or by the lochside of Rannoch on Katie his rhetoric using;
7625,IV,"He who, his three weeks past, past now long ago, to the cottage"
7626,IV,Punctual promised return to cares of classes and classics.
7627,IV,"He who, smit to the heart by that youngest comeliest daughter,"
7628,IV,"Bent, unregardful of spies, at her feet, spreading clothes from her"
7629,IV,wash-tub?
7630,IV,"Can it be with him through Badenoch, Morrer, and Ardnamurchan;"
7631,IV,Can it be with him he beareth the golden-haired lassie of Rannoch?
7632,IV,"This fierce, furious walking—o’er mountain-top and moorland,"
7633,IV,"Sleeping in shieling and bothie, with drover on hill-side sleeping,"
7634,IV,"Folded in plaid, where sheep are strewn thicker than rocks by Loch Awen,"
7635,IV,"This fierce, furious travel unwearying—cannot in truth be"
7636,IV,Merely the wedding tour succeeding the week of wooing!
7637,IV,"No, wherever be Katie, with Philip she is not; I see him,"
7638,IV,"Lo, and he sitteth alone, and these are his words in the mountain."
7639,IV,Spirits escaped from the body can enter and be with the living;
7640,IV,"Entering unseen, and retiring unquestioned, they bring,—do they feel"
7641,IV,too?—
7642,IV,"Joy, pure joy, as they mingle and mix inner essence with essence;"
7643,IV,"Would I were dead, I keep saying, that so I could go and uphold her!"
7644,IV,"Joy, pure joy, bringing with them, and, when they retire, leaving after"
7645,IV,"No cruel shame, no prostration, despondency; memories rather,"
7646,IV,Sweet happy hopes bequeathing. Ah! wherefore not thus with the living?
7647,IV,"Would I were dead, I keep saying, that so I could go and uphold her!"
7648,IV,"Is it impossible, say you, these passionate fervent impulsions,"
7649,IV,"These projections of spirit to spirit, these inward embraces,"
7650,IV,"Should in strange ways, in her dreams, should visit her, strengthen"
7651,IV,"her, shield her?"
7652,IV,"Is it possible, rather, that these great floods of feeling"
7653,IV,"Setting-in daily from me towards her should, impotent wholly,"
7654,IV,Bring neither sound nor motion to that sweet shore they heave to?
7655,IV,"Efflux here, and there no stir nor pulse of influx!"
7656,IV,"Would I were dead, I keep saying, that so I could go and uphold her!"
7657,IV,"Surely, surely, when sleepless I lie in the mountain lamenting,"
7658,IV,"Surely, surely, she hears in her dreams a voice, ‘I am with thee,’"
7659,IV,"Saying, ‘although not with thee; behold, for we mated our spirits"
7660,IV,"Then, when we stood in the chamber, and knew not the words we were"
7661,IV,saying;’
7662,IV,"Yea, if she felt me within her, when not with one finger I touched her"
7663,IV,"Surely she knows it, and feels it while sorrowing here in the moorland."
7664,IV,"Would I were dead, I keep saying, that so I could go and uphold her!"
7665,IV,"Spirits with spirits commingle and separate; lightly as winds do,"
7666,IV,Spice-laden South with the ocean-born zephyr! they mingle and sunder;
7667,IV,"No sad remorses for them, no visions of horror and vileness."
7668,IV,"Would I were dead, I keep saying, that so I could go and uphold her!"
7669,IV,"Surely the force that here sweeps me along in its violent impulse,"
7670,IV,"Surely my strength shall be in her, my help and protection about her,"
7671,IV,"Surely in inner-sweet gladness and vigour of joy shall sustain her,"
7672,IV,"Till, the brief winter o’er-past, her own true sap in the springtide"
7673,IV,"Rise, and the tree I have bared be verdurous e’en as aforetime!"
7674,IV,"Surely it may be, it should be, it must be. Yet ever and ever,"
7675,IV,"Would I were dead, I keep saying, that so I could go and uphold her!"
7676,IV,"No, wherever be Katie, with Philip she is not: behold, for"
7677,IV,"Here he is sitting alone, and these are his words in the mountain."
7678,IV,"And, at the farm on the lochside of Rannoch, in parlour and kitchen,"
7679,IV,"Hark! there is music—the flowing of music, of milk, and of whisky;"
7680,IV,"Lo, I see piping and dancing! and whom in the midst of the battle"
7681,IV,"Cantering loudly along there, or, look you, with arms uplifted,"
7682,IV,"Whistling, and snapping his fingers, and seizing his gay-smiling Janet,"
7683,IV,"Whom?—whom else but the Piper? the wary precognisant Piper,"
7684,IV,"Who, for the love of gay Janet, and mindful of old invitation,"
7685,IV,"Putting it quite as a duty and urging grave claims to attention,"
7686,IV,"True to his night had crossed over: there goeth he, brimful of music,"
7687,IV,"Like a cork tossed by the eddies that foam under furious lasher,"
7688,IV,"Like to skiff, lifted, uplifted, in lock, by the swift-swelling sluices,"
7689,IV,"So with the music possessing him, swaying him, goeth he, look you,"
7690,IV,"Swinging and flinging, and stamping and tramping, and grasping and"
7691,IV,clasping
7692,IV,"Whom but gay Janet?—Him rivalling, Hobbes, briefest-kilted of heroes,"
7693,IV,"Enters, O stoutest, O rashest of creatures, mere fool of a Saxon,"
7694,IV,"Skill-less of philabeg, skill-less of reel too,—the whirl and the twirl"
7695,IV,o’t:
7696,IV,"Him see I frisking, and whisking, and ever at swifter gyration"
7697,IV,Under brief curtain revealing broad acres—not of broad cloth.
7698,IV,Him see I there and the Piper—the Piper what vision beholds not?
7699,IV,"Him and His Honour with Arthur, with Janet our Piper, and is it,"
7700,IV,"Is it, O marvel of marvels! he too in the maze of the mazy,"
7701,IV,"Skipping, and tripping, though stately, though languid, with head on one"
7702,IV,"shoulder,"
7703,IV,"Airlie, with sight of the waistcoat the golden-haired Katie consoling?"
7704,IV,"Katie, who simple and comely, and smiling and blushing as ever,"
7705,IV,"What though she wear on that neck a blue kerchief remembered as Philip’s,"
7706,IV,Seems in her maidenly freedom to need small consolement of waistcoats!—
7707,IV,"Wherefore in Badenoch then, far-away, in Lochaber, Lochiel, in"
7708,IV,"Knoydart, Moydart, Morrer, Ardgower, or Ardnamurchan,"
7709,IV,"Wanders o’er mountain and moorland, in shieling or bothie is sleeping,"
7710,IV,"He, who,—and why should he not then? capricious? or is it rejected?"
7711,IV,"Might to the piping of Rannoch be pressing the thrilling fair fingers,"
7712,IV,"Might, as he clasped her, transmit to her bosom the throb of his"
7713,IV,"own—yea,—"
7714,IV,Might in the joy of the reel be wooing and winning his Katie?
7715,IV,What is it Adam reads far off by himself in the cottage?
7716,IV,"Reads yet again with emotion, again is preparing to answer?"
7717,IV,What is it Adam is reading? What was it Philip had written?
7718,IV,"There was it writ, how Philip possessed undoubtedly had been,"
7719,IV,"Deeply, entirely possessed by the charm of the maiden of Rannoch;"
7720,IV,Deeply as never before! how sweet and bewitching he felt her
7721,IV,"Seen still before him at work, in the garden, the byre, the kitchen;"
7722,IV,"How it was beautiful to him to stoop at her side in the shearing,"
7723,IV,"Binding uncouthly the ears that fell from her dexterous sickle,"
7724,IV,"Building uncouthly the stooks,[10] which she laid by her sickle to"
7725,IV,"straighten,"
7726,IV,How at the dance he had broken through shyness; for four days after
7727,IV,"Lived on her eyes, unspeaking what lacked not articulate speaking;"
7728,IV,Felt too that she too was feeling what he did.—Howbeit they parted!
7729,IV,"How by a kiss from her lips he had seemed made nobler and stronger,"
7730,IV,"Yea, for the first time in life a man complete and perfect,"
7731,IV,So forth! much that before has been heard of.—Howbeit they parted!
7732,IV,"What had ended it all, he said, was singular, very.—"
7733,IV,I was walking along some two miles off from the cottage
7734,IV,Full of my dreamings—a girl went by in a party with others;
7735,IV,"She had a cloak on, was stepping on quickly, for rain was beginning;"
7736,IV,"But as she passed, from her hood I saw her eyes look at me."
7737,IV,"So quick a glance, so regardless I, that although I had felt it,"
7738,IV,"You couldn’t properly say our eyes met. She cast it, and left it:"
7739,IV,It was three minutes perhaps ere I knew what it was. I had seen her
7740,IV,"Somewhere before I am sure, but that wasn’t it; not its import;"
7741,IV,"No, it had seemed to regard me with simple superior insight,"
7742,IV,"Quietly saying to itself—Yes, there he is still in his fancy,"
7743,IV,Letting drop from him at random as things not worth his considering
7744,IV,"All the benefits gathered and put in his hands by fortune,"
7745,IV,"Loosing a hold which others, contented and unambitious,"
7746,IV,"Trying down here to keep up, know the value of better than he does,"
7747,IV,"What is this? was it perhaps?—Yes, there he is still in his fancy,"
7748,IV,Doesn’t yet see we have here just the things he is used to elsewhere;
7749,IV,People here too are people and not as fairy-land creatures;
7750,IV,"He is in a trance, and possessed; I wonder how long to continue;"
7751,IV,It is a shame and a pity—and no good likely to follow.—
7752,IV,"Something like this, but indeed I cannot attempt to define it."
7753,IV,"Only, three hours thence I was off and away in the moorland,"
7754,IV,Hiding myself from myself if I could; the arrow within me.
7755,IV,"Katie was not in the house, thank God: I saw her in passing,"
7756,IV,"Saw her, unseen myself, with the pang of a cruel desertion;"
7757,IV,"What she thinks about it, God knows! poor child; may she only"
7758,IV,"Think me a fool and a madman, and no more worth her remembering!"
7759,IV,"Meantime all through the mountains I hurry and know not whither,"
7760,IV,"Tramp along here, and think, and know not what I should think."
7761,IV,"Tell me then, why, as I sleep amid hill-tops high in the moorland,"
7762,IV,"Still in my dreams I am pacing the streets of the dissolute city,"
7763,IV,"Where dressy girls slithering by upon pavements give sign for accosting,"
7764,IV,"Paint on their beautiless cheeks, and hunger and shame in their bosoms;"
7765,IV,"Hunger by drink, and by that which they shudder yet burn for, appeasing,—"
7766,IV,Hiding their shame—ah God!—in the glare of the public gas-lights?
7767,IV,"Why, while I feel my ears catching through slumber the run of the"
7768,IV,"streamlet,"
7769,IV,"Still am I pacing the pavement, and seeing the sign for accosting,"
7770,IV,"Still am I passing those figures, not daring to look in their faces?"
7771,IV,"Why, when the chill, ere the light, of the daybreak uneasily wakes me,"
7772,IV,"Find I a cry in my heart crying up to the heaven of heavens,"
7773,IV,"No, Great Unjust Judge! she is purity; I am the lost one."
7774,IV,You will not think that I soberly look for such things for sweet Katie;
7775,IV,"No, but the vision is on me; I now first see how it happens,"
7776,IV,Feel how tender and soft is the heart of a girl; how passive
7777,IV,"Fain would it be, how helpless; and helplessness leads to destruction."
7778,IV,"Maiden reserve torn from off it, grows never again to reclothe it,"
7779,IV,Modesty broken through once to immodesty flies for protection.
7780,IV,"Oh, who saws through the trunk, though he leave the tree up in the"
7781,IV,"forest,"
7782,IV,"When the next wind casts it down,—is _his_ not the hand that smote it?"
7783,IV,"This is the answer, the second, which, pondering long with emotion,"
7784,IV,There by himself in the cottage the Tutor addressed to Philip.
7785,IV,"I have perhaps been severe, dear Philip, and hasty; forgive me;"
7786,IV,For I was fain to reply ere I wholly had read through your letter;
7787,IV,And it was written in scraps with crossings and counter-crossings
7788,IV,"Hard to connect with each other correctly, and hard to decipher;"
7789,IV,"Paper was scarce, I suppose: forgive me; I write to console you."
7790,IV,"Grace is given of God, but knowledge is bought in the market;"
7791,IV,"Knowledge needful for all, yet cannot be had for the asking."
7792,IV,"There are exceptional beings, one finds them distant and rarely,"
7793,IV,"Who, endowed with the vision alike and the interpretation,"
7794,IV,"See, by the neighbours’ eyes and their own still motions enlightened,"
7795,IV,"In the beginning the end, in the acorn the oak of the forest,"
7796,IV,"In the child of to-day its children to long generations,"
7797,IV,"In a thought or a wish a life, a drama, an epos."
7798,IV,"There are inheritors, is it? by mystical generation"
7799,IV,Heiring the wisdom and ripeness of spirits gone by; without labour
7800,IV,Owning what others by doing and suffering earn; what old men
7801,IV,"After long years of mistake and erasure are proud to have come to,"
7802,IV,Sick with mistake and erasure possess when possession is idle.
7803,IV,"Yes, there is power upon earth, seen feebly in women and children,"
7804,IV,"Which can, laying one hand on the cover, read off, unfaltering,"
7805,IV,"Leaf after leaf unlifted, the words of the closed book under,"
7806,IV,"Words which we are poring at, hammering at, stumbling at, spelling."
7807,IV,Rare is this; wisdom mostly is bought for a price in the market;—
7808,IV,"Rare is this; and happy, who buys so much for so little,"
7809,IV,"As I conceive have you, and as I will hope has Katie."
7810,IV,"Knowledge is needful for man,—needful no less for woman,"
7811,IV,"Even in Highland glens, were they vacant of shooter and tourist."
7812,IV,"Not that, of course, I mean to prefer your blindfold hurry"
7813,IV,Unto a soul that abides most loving yet most withholding;
7814,IV,"Least unfeeling though calm, self-contained yet most unselfish;"
7815,IV,"Renders help and accepts it, a man among men that are brothers,"
7816,IV,"Views, not plucks the beauty, adores, and demands no embracing,"
7817,IV,So in its peaceful passage whatever is lovely and gracious
7818,IV,"Still without seizing or spoiling, itself in itself reproducing."
7819,IV,"No, I do not set Philip herein on the level of Arthur;"
7820,IV,"No, I do not compare still tarn with furious torrent,"
7821,IV,"Yet will the tarn overflow, assuaged in the lake be the torrent."
7822,IV,"Women are weak, as you say, and love of all things to be passive,"
7823,IV,"Passive, patient, receptive, yea, even of wrong and misdoing,"
7824,IV,Even to force and misdoing with joy and victorious feeling
7825,IV,"Patient, passive, receptive; for that is the strength of their being,"
7826,IV,"Like to the earth taking all things, and all to good converting."
7827,IV,"Oh ’tis a snare indeed!—Moreover, remember it, Philip,"
7828,IV,"To the prestige of the richer the lowly are prone to be yielding,"
7829,IV,"Think that in dealing with them they are raised to a different region,"
7830,IV,"Where old laws and morals are modified, lost, exist not;"
7831,IV,"Ignorant they as they are, they have but to conform and be yielding."
7832,IV,"But I have spoken of this already, and need not repeat it."
7833,IV,"You will not now run after what merely attracts and entices,"
7834,IV,"Every-day things highly-coloured, and common-place carved and gilded."
7835,IV,"You will henceforth seek only the good: and seek it, Philip,"
7836,IV,"Where it is—not more abundant, perhaps, but—more easily met with;"
7837,IV,"Where you are surer to find it, less likely to run into error,"
7838,IV,"In your station, not thinking about it, but not disregarding."
7839,IV,"So was the letter completed: a postscript afterward added,"
7840,IV,Telling the tale that was told by the dancers returning from Rannoch.
7841,IV,"So was the letter completed: but query, whither to send it?"
7842,IV,"Not for the will of the wisp, the cloud, and the hawk of the moorland,"
7843,IV,"Ranging afar thro’ Lochaber, Lochiel, and Knoydart, and Moydart,"
7844,IV,Have even latest extensions adjusted a postal arrangement.
7845,IV,"Query resolved very shortly, when Hope, from his chamber descending,"
7846,IV,"Came with a note in his hand from the Lady, his aunt, at the Castle;"
7847,IV,Came and revealed the contents of a missive that brought strange tidings;
7848,IV,"Came and announced to the friends, in a voice that was husky with wonder,"
7849,IV,"Philip was staying at Balloch, was there in the room with the Countess,"
7850,IV,Philip to Balloch had come and was dancing with Lady Maria.
7851,IV,"Philip at Balloch, he said, after all that stately refusal,"
7852,IV,"He there at last—O strange! O marvel, marvel of marvels!"
7853,IV,"Airlie, the Waistcoat, with Katie, we left him this morning at Rannoch;"
7854,IV,"Airlie with Katie, he said, and Philip with Lady Maria."
7855,IV,"And amid laughter Adam paced up and down, repeating"
7856,IV,"Over and over, unconscious, the phrase which Hope had lent him,"
7857,IV,"Dancing at Balloch, you say, in the Castle, with Lady Maria."

7864,V,
7865,V,So in the cottage with Adam the pupils five together
7866,V,"Duly remained, and read, and looked no more for Philip,"
7867,V,Philip at Balloch shooting and dancing with Lady Maria.
7868,V,"Breakfast at eight, and now, for brief September daylight,"
7869,V,"Luncheon at two, and dinner at seven, or even later,"
7870,V,"Five full hours between for the loch and the glen and the mountain,—"
7871,V,"So in the joy of their life and glory of shooting-jackets,"
7872,V,"So they read and roamed, the pupils five with Adam."
7873,V,"What if autumnal shower came frequent and chill from the westward,"
7874,V,"What if on browner sward with yellow leaves besprinkled,"
7875,V,"Gemming the crispy blade, the delicate gossamer gemming,"
7876,V,"Frequent and thick lay at morning the chilly beads of hoar-frost,"
7877,V,"Duly in _matutine_ still, and daily, whatever the weather,"
7878,V,Bathed in the rain and the frost and the mist with the Glory of headers
7879,V,"Hope. Thither also at times, of cold and of possible gutters"
7880,V,"Careless, unmindful, unconscious, would Hobbes, or ere they departed,"
7881,V,"Come, in heavy pea-coat his trouserless trunk enfolding,"
7882,V,"Come, under coat over-brief those lusty legs displaying,"
7883,V,All from the shirt to the slipper the natural man revealing.
7884,V,"Duly there they bathed and daily, the twain or the trio,"
7885,V,"Where in the morning was custom, where over a ledge of granite"
7886,V,Into a granite basin the amber torrent descended;
7887,V,"Beautiful, very, to gaze in ere plunging; beautiful also,"
7888,V,"Perfect as picture, as vision entrancing that comes to the sightless,"
7889,V,"Through the great granite jambs the stream, the glen, and the mountain,"
7890,V,"Beautiful, seen by snatches in intervals of dressing,"
7891,V,"Morn after morn, unsought for, recurring; themselves too seeming"
7892,V,"Not as spectators, accepted into it, immingled, as truly"
7893,V,Part of it as are the kine in the field lying there by the birches.
7894,V,"So they bathed, they read, they roamed in glen and forest;"
7895,V,"Far amid blackest pines to the waterfall they shadow,"
7896,V,"Far up the long, long glen to the loch, and the loch beyond it,"
7897,V,"Deep, under huge red cliffs, a secret; and oft by the starlight,"
7898,V,"Or the aurora, perchance, racing home for the eight o’clock mutton."
7899,V,"So they bathed, and read, and roamed in heathery Highland;"
7900,V,There in the joy of their life and glory of shooting-jackets
7901,V,"Bathed and read and roamed, and looked no more for Philip."
7902,V,
7903,V,List to a letter that came from Philip at Balloch to Adam.
7904,V,"I am here, O my friend!—idle, but learning wisdom."
7905,V,"Doing penance, you think; content, if so, in my penance."
7906,V,"Often I find myself saying, while watching in dance or on horseback"
7907,V,"One that is here, in her freedom and grace, and imperial sweetness,"
7908,V,"Often I find myself saying, old faith and doctrine abjuring,"
7909,V,"Into the crucible casting philosophies, facts, convictions,—"
7910,V,"Were it not well that the stem should be naked of leaf and of tendril,"
7911,V,"Poverty-stricken, the barest, the dismallest stick of the garden;"
7912,V,"Flowerless, leafless, unlovely, for ninety-and-nine long summers,"
7913,V,"So in the hundredth, at last, were bloom for one day at the summit,"
7914,V,So but that fleeting flower were lovely as Lady Maria.
7915,V,"Often I find myself saying, and know not myself as I say it,"
7916,V,What of the poor and the weary? their labour and pain is needed.
7917,V,"Perish the poor and the weary! what can they better than perish,"
7918,V,"Perish in labour for her, who is worth the destruction of empires?"
7919,V,"What! for a mite, for a mote, an impalpable odour of honour,"
7920,V,Armies shall bleed; cities burn; and the soldier red from the storming
7921,V,Carry hot rancour and lust into chambers of mothers and daughters:
7922,V,"What! would ourselves for the cause of an hour encounter the battle,"
7923,V,"Slay and be slain; lie rotting in hospital, hulk, and prison:"
7924,V,"Die as a dog dies; die mistaken perhaps, and dishonoured."
7925,V,"Yea,—and shall hodmen in beer-shops complain of a glory denied them,"
7926,V,Which could not ever be theirs more than now it is theirs as spectators?
7927,V,"Which could not be, in all earth, if it were not for labour of hodmen?"
7928,V,"And I find myself saying, and what I am saying, discern not,"
7929,V,"Dig in thy deep dark prison, O miner! and finding be thankful;"
7930,V,"Though unpolished by thee, unto thee unseen in perfection,"
7931,V,"While thou art eating black bread in the poisonous air of thy cavern,"
7932,V,Far away glitters the gem on the peerless neck of a Princess.
7933,V,"Dig, and starve, and be thankful; it is so, and thou hast been aiding."
7934,V,"Often I find myself saying, in irony is it, or earnest?"
7935,V,"Yea, what is more, be rich, O ye rich! be sublime in great houses,"
7936,V,Purple and delicate linen endure; be of Burgundy patient;
7937,V,"Suffer that service be done you, permit of the page and the valet,"
7938,V,"Vex not your souls with annoyance of charity schools or of districts,"
7939,V,Cast not to swine of the stye the pearls that should gleam in your
7940,V,foreheads.
7941,V,"Live, be lovely, forget them, be beautiful even to proudness,"
7942,V,Even for their poor sakes whose happiness is to behold you;
7943,V,"Live, be uncaring, be joyous, be sumptuous; only be lovely,—"
7944,V,"Sumptuous not for display, and joyous, not for enjoyment;"
7945,V,Not for enjoyment truly; for Beauty and God’s great glory!
7946,V,"Yes, and I say, and it seems inspiration—of Good or of Evil!"
7947,V,"Is it not He that hath done it, and who shall dare gainsay it?"
7948,V,"Is it not even of Him, who hath made us?—Yea, _for the lions,_"
7949,V,"_Roaring after their prey, do seek their meat from God_!"
7950,V,"Is it not even of Him, who one kind over another"
7951,V,All the works of His hand hath disposed in a wonderful order?
7952,V,"Who hath made man, as the beasts, to live the one on the other,"
7953,V,Who hath made man as Himself to know the law—and accept it!
7954,V,"You will wonder at this, no doubt! I also wonder!"
7955,V,But we must live and learn; we can’t know all things at twenty.
7956,V,List to a letter of Hobbes to Philip his friend at Balloch.
7957,V,"All Cathedrals are Christian, all Christians are Cathedrals,"
7958,V,Such is the Catholic doctrine; ’tis ours with a slight variation;
7959,V,"Every woman is, or ought to be, a Cathedral,"
7960,V,"Built on the ancient plan, a Cathedral pure and perfect,"
7961,V,"Built by that only law, that Use be suggester of Beauty,"
7962,V,"Nothing concealed that is done, but all things done to adornment,"
7963,V,Meanest utilities seized as occasions to grace and embellish.—
7964,V,"So had I duly commenced in the spirit and style of my Philip,"
7965,V,So had I formally opened the Treatise upon _the Laws of_
7966,V,"_Architectural Beauty in Application to Women_,"
7967,V,So had I writ.—But my fancies are palsied by tidings they tell me.
7968,V,"Tidings—ah me, can it be then? that I, the blasphemer accounted,"
7969,V,"Here am with reverent heed at the wondrous Analogy working,"
7970,V,"Pondering thy words and thy gestures, whilst thou, a prophet apostate,"
7971,V,"(How are the mighty fallen!) whilst thou, a shepherd travestie,"
7972,V,"(How are the mighty fallen!) with gun,—with pipe no longer,"
7973,V,"Teachest the woods to re-echo thy game-killing recantations,"
7974,V,"Teachest thy verse to exalt Amaryllis, a Countess’s daughter?"
7975,V,"What, thou forgettest, bewildered, my Master, that rightly considered"
7976,V,"Beauty must ever be useful, what truly is useful is graceful?"
7977,V,"She that is handy is handsome, good dairy-maids must be good-looking,"
7978,V,"If but the butter be nice, the tournure of the elbow is shapely,"
7979,V,"If the cream-cheeses be white, far whiter the hands that made them,"
7980,V,"If—but alas, is it true? while the pupil alone in the cottage"
7981,V,"Slowly elaborates here thy System of Feminine Graces,"
7982,V,"Thou in the palace, its author, art dining, small-talking and dancing,"
7983,V,Dancing and pressing the fingers kid-gloved of a Lady Maria.
7984,V,"These are the final words, that came to the Tutor from Balloch."
7985,V,"I am conquered, it seems! you will meet me, I hope, in Oxford,"
7986,V,"Altered in manners and mind. I yield to the laws and arrangements,"
7987,V,Yield to the ancient existent decrees: who am I to resist them?
7988,V,"Yes, you will find me altered in mind, I think, as in manners,"
7989,V,Anxious too to atone for six weeks’ loss of your Logic.
7990,V,
7991,V,"So in the cottage with Adam, the pupils five together,"

8027,VI,"Bonnie and young; they’re healthier here, I judge, and safer,"
8028,VI,"I myself find time for their reading, writing, and learning."
8029,VI,"So on the road they walk by the shore of the salt sea water,"
8030,VI,"Silent a youth and maid, and elders twain conversing."
8031,VI,This was the letter that came when Adam was leaving the cottage.
8032,VI,"If you can manage to see me before going off to Dartmoor,"
8033,VI,"Come by Tuesday’s coach through Glencoe (you have not seen it),"
8034,VI,"Stop at the ferry below, and ask your way (you will wonder,"
8035,VI,There however I am) to the Bothie of Tober-na-vuolich.
8036,VI,"And on another scrap, of next day’s date, was written:—"
8037,VI,"It was by accident purely I lit on the place; I was returning,"
8038,VI,"Quietly, travelling homeward by one of these wretched coaches;"
8039,VI,One of the horses cast a shoe; and a farmer passing
8040,VI,"Said, Old David’s your man; a clever fellow at shoeing"
8041,VI,Once; just here by the firs; they call it Tober-na-vuolich.
8042,VI,"So I saw and spoke with David Mackaye, our acquaintance."
8043,VI,"When we came to the journey’s end some five miles farther,"
8044,VI,In my unoccupied evening I walked back again to the bothie.
8045,VI,"But on a final crossing, still later in date, was added:"
8046,VI,Come as soon as you can; be sure and do not refuse me.
8047,VI,"Who would have guessed I should find my haven and end of my travel,"
8048,VI,"Here, by accident too, in the bothie we laughed about so?"
8049,VI,Who would have guessed that here would be she whose glance at Rannoch
8050,VI,"Turned me in that mysterious way; yes, angels conspiring,"
8051,VI,"Slowly drew me, conducted me, home, to herself; the needle"
8052,VI,"Which in the shaken compass flew hither and thither, at last, long"
8053,VI,"Quivering, poises to north. I think so. But I am cautious:"
8054,VI,"More, at least, than I was in the old silly days when I left you."
8055,VI,Not at the bothie now; at the changehouse in the clachan;[11]
8056,VI,Why I delay my letter is more than I can tell you.
8057,VI,
8058,VI,"There was another scrap, without or date or comment,"
8059,VI,"Dotted over with various observations, as follows:"
8060,VI,"Only think, I had danced with her twice, and did not remember."
8061,VI,"I was as one that sleeps on the railway; one, who dreaming"
8062,VI,Hears thro’ his dream the name of his home shouted out; hears and hears
8063,VI,"not,—"
8064,VI,"Faint, and louder again, and less loud, dying in distance;"
8065,VI,"Dimly conscious, with something of inward debate and choice,—and"
8066,VI,"Sense of claim and reality present, anon relapses"
8067,VI,"Nevertheless, and continues the dream and fancy, while forward"
8068,VI,"Swiftly, remorseless, the car presses on, he knows not whither."
8069,VI,"Handsome who handsome is, who handsome does is more so;"
8070,VI,"Pretty is all very pretty, it’s prettier far to be useful."
8071,VI,"No, fair Lady Maria, I say not that; but I _will_ say,"
8072,VI,"Stately is service accepted, but lovelier service rendered,"
8073,VI,Interchange of service the law and condition of beauty:
8074,VI,Any way beautiful only to be the thing one is meant for.
8075,VI,"I, I am sure, for the sphere of mere ornament am not intended:"
8076,VI,"No, nor she, I think, thy sister at Tober-na-vuolich."
8077,VI,"This was the letter of Philip, and this had brought the Tutor:"
8078,VI,This is why Tutor and pupil are walking with David and Elspie.—
8079,VI,"When for the night they part, and these, once more together,"
8080,VI,"Went by the lochside along to the changehouse near in the clachan,"
8081,VI,"Thus to his pupil anon commenced the grave man, Adam."
8082,VI,"Yes, she is beautiful, Philip, beautiful even as morning:"
8083,VI,"Yes, it is that which I said, the Good and not the Attractive!"
8084,VI,"Happy is he that finds, and finding does not leave it!"
8085,VI,"Ten more days did Adam with Philip abide at the changehouse,"
8086,VI,"Ten more nights they met, they walked with father and daughter."
8087,VI,"Ten more nights, and night by night more distant away were"
8088,VI,"Philip and she; every night less heedful, by habit, the father."
8089,VI,"Happy ten days, most happy: and, otherwise than intended,"
8090,VI,"Fortunate visit of Adam, companion and friend to David."
8091,VI,"Happy ten days, be ye fruitful of happiness! Pass o’er them slowly,"
8092,VI,"Slowly; like cruse of the prophet be multiplied, even to ages!"
8093,VI,"Pass slowly o’er them, ye days of October; ye soft misty mornings,"
8094,VI,"Long dusky eves; pass slowly; and thou, great Term-time of Oxford"
8095,VI,"Awful with lectures and books, and Little-goes, and Great-goes,"
8096,VI,"Till but the sweet bud be perfect, recede and retire for the lovers,"
8097,VI,"Yea, for the sweet love of lovers, postpone thyself even to doomsday!"
8098,VI,"Pass o’er them slowly, ye hours! Be with them, ye Loves and Graces!"
8099,VI,"Indirect and evasive no longer, a cowardly bather,"
8100,VI,"Clinging to bough and to rock, and sidling along by the edges,"
8101,VI,"In your faith, ye Muses and Graces, who love the plain present,"
8102,VI,"Scorning historic abridgment and artifice anti-poetic,"
8103,VI,"In your faith, ye Muses and Loves, ye Loves and Graces,"
8104,VI,"I will confront the great peril, and speak with the mouth of the lovers,"
8105,VI,"As they spoke by the alders, at evening, the runnel below them,"
8106,VI,"Elspie, a diligent knitter, and Philip her fingers watching."
8107,VI,
8108,VI,
8109,VII,VII
8110,VII,
8111,VII,"_Vesper adest, juvenes, consurgite. Vesper Olympo_"
8112,VII,_Expectata diu vix tandem lumina tollit._
8113,VII,
8114,VII,"For she confessed, as they sat in the dusk, and he saw not her blushes,"
8115,VII,"Elspie confessed at the sports long ago with her father she saw him,"
8116,VII,When at the door the old man had told him the name of the bothie;
8117,VII,Then after that at the dance; yet again at a dance in Rannoch—
8118,VII,"And she was silent, confused. Confused much rather Philip"
8119,VII,"Buried his face in his hands, his face that with blood was bursting."
8120,VII,"Silent, confused, yet by pity she conquered her fear, and continued."
8121,VII,"Katie is good and not silly; be comforted, Sir, about her;"
8122,VII,"Katie is good and not silly; tender, but not, like many,"
8123,VII,"Carrying off, and at once, for fear of being seen, in the bosom"
8124,VII,"Locking-up as in a cupboard the pleasure that any man gives them,"
8125,VII,Keeping it out of sight as a prize they need be ashamed of;
8126,VII,"That is the way, I think, Sir, in England more than in Scotland;"
8127,VII,"No, she lives and takes pleasure in all, as in beautiful weather,"
8128,VII,"Sorry to lose it, but just as we would be to lose fine weather."
8129,VII,"And she is strong to return to herself and feel undeserted,"
8130,VII,"Oh, she is strong, and not silly: she thinks no further about you;"
8131,VII,"She has had kerchiefs before from gentle, I know, as from simple."
8132,VII,"Yes, she is good and not silly; yet were you wrong, Mr. Philip,"
8133,VII,"Wrong, for yourself perhaps more than for her."
8134,VII,"But Philip replied not,"
8135,VII,Raised not his eyes from the hands on his knees.
8136,VII,And Elspie continued.
8137,VII,"That was what gave me much pain, when I met you that dance at Rannoch,"
8138,VII,"Dancing myself too with you, while Katie danced with Donald;"
8139,VII,"That was what gave me such pain; I thought it all a mistaking,"
8140,VII,"All a mere chance, you know, and accident,—not proper choosing,—"
8141,VII,"There were at least five or six—not there, no, that I don’t say,"
8142,VII,But in the country about—you might just as well have been courting
8143,VII,"That was what gave me much pain, and (you won’t remember that, though),"
8144,VII,"Three days after, I met you, beside my uncle’s, walking,"
8145,VII,"And I was wondering much, and hoped you wouldn’t notice,"
8146,VII,So as I passed I couldn’t help looking. You didn’t know me.
8147,VII,"But I was glad, when I heard next day you were gone to the teacher."
8148,VII,"And uplifting his face at last, with eyes dilated,"
8149,VII,"Large as great stars in mist, and dim, with dabbled lashes,"
8150,VII,"Philip, with new tears starting,"
8151,VII,"You think I do not remember,"
8152,VII,"Said,—suppose that I did not observe! Ah me, shall I tell you?"
8153,VII,"Elspie, it was your look that sent me away from Rannoch."
8154,VII,"It was your glance, that, descending, an instant revelation,"
8155,VII,"Showed me where I was, and whitherward going; recalled me,"
8156,VII,"Sent me, not to my books, but to wrestlings of thought in the mountains."
8157,VII,"Yes, I have carried your glance within me undimmed, unaltered,"
8158,VII,"As a lost boat the compass some passing ship has lent her,"
8159,VII,"Many a weary mile on road, and hill, and moorland:"
8160,VII,"And you suppose that I do not remember, I had not observed it!"
8161,VII,"O, did the sailor bewildered observe when they told him his bearings?"
8162,VII,"O, did he cast overboard, when they parted, the compass they gave him?"
8163,VII,"And he continued more firmly, although with stronger emotion:"
8164,VII,"Elspie, why should I speak it? you cannot believe it, and should not:"
8165,VII,"Why should I say that I love, which I all but said to another?"
8166,VII,"Yet should I dare, should I say, O Elspie, you only I love; you,"
8167,VII,First and sole in my life that has been and surely that shall be;
8168,VII,"Could—O, could you believe it, O Elspie, believe it and spurn not?"
8169,VII,"Is it—possible,—possible, Elspie?"
8170,VII,"Well,—she answered,"
8171,VII,"And she was silent some time, and blushed all over, and answered"
8172,VII,"Quietly, after her fashion, still knitting, Maybe, I think of it,"
8173,VII,"Though I don’t know that I did: and she paused again; but it may be,"
8174,VII,"Yes,—I don’t know, Mr. Philip,—but only it feels to me strangely,"
8175,VII,"Like to the high new bridge, they used to build at, below there,"
8176,VII,Over the burn and glen on the road. You won’t understand me.
8177,VII,But I keep saying in my mind—this long time slowly with trouble
8178,VII,"I have been building myself, up, up, and toilfully raising,"
8179,VII,"Just like as if the bridge were to do it itself without masons,"
8180,VII,"Painfully getting myself upraised one stone on another,"
8181,VII,All one side I mean; and now I see on the other
8182,VII,"Just such another fabric uprising, better and stronger,"
8183,VII,"Close to me, coming to join me: and then I sometimes fancy,—"
8184,VII,"Sometimes I find myself dreaming at nights about arches and bridges,—"
8185,VII,"Sometimes I dream of a great invisible hand coming down, and"
8186,VII,"Dropping the great key-stone in the middle: there in my dreaming,"
8187,VII,"There I felt the great-key stone coming in, and through it"
8188,VII,"Feel the other part—all the other stones of the archway,"
8189,VII,"Joined into mine with a strange happy sense of completeness. But,"
8190,VII,"dear me,"
8191,VII,This is confusion and nonsense. I mix all the things I can think of.
8192,VII,"And you won’t understand, Mr. Philip."
8193,VII,"But while she was speaking,"
8194,VII,"So it happened, a moment she paused from her work, and pondering,"
8195,VII,Laid her hand on her lap: Philip took it: she did not resist:
8196,VII,"So he retained her fingers, the knitting being stopped. But emotion"
8197,VII,"Came all over her more and yet more from his hand, from her heart, and"
8198,VII,Most from the sweet idea and image her brain was renewing.
8199,VII,"So he retained her hand, and, his tears down-dropping on it,"
8200,VII,"Trembling a long time, kissed it at last. And she ended."
8201,VII,"And as she ended, uprose he: saying, What have I heard? Oh,"
8202,VII,"What have I done, that such words should be said to me? Oh, I see it,"
8203,VII,See the great key-stone coming down from the heaven of heavens;
8204,VII,"And he fell at her feet, and buried his face in her apron."
8205,VII,"But as under the moon and stars they went to the cottage,"
8206,VII,"Elspie sighed and said, Be patient, dear Mr. Philip,"
8207,VII,"Do not do anything hasty. It is all so soon, so sudden."
8208,VII,Do not say anything yet to any one.
8209,VII,"Elspie, he answered,"
8210,VII,Does not my friend go on Friday? I then shall see nothing of you.
8211,VII,Do not I go myself on Monday?
8212,VII,"But oh, he said, Elspie!"
8213,VII,"Do as I bid you, my child: do not go on calling me Mr.;"
8214,VII,Might I not just as well be calling you Miss Elspie?
8215,VII,"Call me, this heavenly night for once, for the first time, Philip."
8216,VII,"Philip, she said, and laughed, and said she could not say it;"
8217,VII,"Philip, she said; he turned, and kissed the sweet lips as they said it."
8218,VII,
8219,VII,But on the morrow Elspie kept out of the way of Philip:
8220,VII,"And at the evening seat, when he took her hand by the alders,"
8221,VII,"Drew it back, saying, almost peevishly,"
8222,VII,"No, Mr. Philip,"
8223,VII,"I was quite right, last night; it is too soon, too sudden."
8224,VII,"What I told you before was foolish perhaps, was hasty."
8225,VII,"When I think it over, I am shocked and terrified at it."
8226,VII,"Not that at all I unsay it; that is, I know I said it,"
8227,VII,"And when I said it, felt it. But oh, we must wait, Mr. Philip!"
8228,VII,We mustn’t pull ourselves at the great key-stone of the centre:
8229,VII,"Some one else up above must hold it, fit it, and fix it;"
8230,VII,"If we try ourselves, we shall only damage the archway,"
8231,VII,"Damage all our own work that we wrought, our painful upbuilding."
8232,VII,"When, you remember, you took my hand last evening, talking,"
8233,VII,I was all over a tremble: and as you pressed the fingers
8234,VII,"After, and afterwards kissed them, I could not speak. And then, too,"
8235,VII,"As we went home, you kissed me for saying your name. It was dreadful."
8236,VII,"I have been kissed before, she added, blushing slightly,"
8237,VII,"I have been kissed more than once by Donald my cousin, and others;"
8238,VII,"It is the way of the lads, and I make up my mind not to mind it;"
8239,VII,"But, Mr. Philip, last night, and from you, it was different, quite, Sir."
8240,VII,"When I think of all that, I am shocked and terrified at it."
8241,VII,"Yes, it is dreadful to me."
8242,VII,"She paused, but quickly continued,"
8243,VII,"Smiling almost fiercely, continued, looking upward."
8244,VII,"You are too strong, you see, Mr. Philip! just like the sea there,"
8245,VII,"Which _will_ come, through the straits and all between the mountains"
8246,VII,"Forcing its great strong tide into every nook and inlet,"
8247,VII,"Getting far in, up the quiet stream of sweet inland water,"
8248,VII,"Sucking it up, and stopping it, turning it, driving it backward,"
8249,VII,"Quite preventing its own quiet running: and then, soon after,"
8250,VII,"Back it goes off, leaving weeds on the shore, and wrack and uncleanness:"
8251,VII,"And the poor burn in the glen tries again its peaceful running,"
8252,VII,"But it is brackish and tainted, and all its banks in disorder."
8253,VII,"That was what I dreamt all last night. I was the burnie,"
8254,VII,"Trying to get along through the tyrannous brine, and could not;"
8255,VII,"I was confined and squeezed in the coils of the great salt tide, that"
8256,VII,"Would mix-in itself with me, and change me; I felt myself changing;"
8257,VII,"And I struggled, and screamed, I believe, in my dream. It was dreadful."
8258,VII,"You are too strong, Mr. Philip! I am but a poor slender burnie,"
8259,VII,"Used to the glens and the rocks, the rowan and birch of the woodies,"
8260,VII,Quite unused to the great salt sea; quite afraid and unwilling.
8261,VII,"Ere she had spoken two words, had Philip released her fingers;"
8262,VII,"As she went on, he recoiled, fell back, and shook and shivered;"
8263,VII,"There he stood, looking pale and ghastly; when she had ended,"
8264,VII,"Answering in hollow voice,"
8265,VII,"It is true; oh, quite true, Elspie;"
8266,VII,"Oh, you are always right; oh, what, what have I been doing?"
8267,VII,"I will depart to-morrow. But oh, forget me not wholly,"
8268,VII,"Wholly, Elspie, nor hate me; no, do not hate me, my Elspie."
8269,VII,But a revulsion passed through the brain and bosom of Elspie;
8270,VII,"And she got up from her seat on the rock, putting by her knitting;"
8271,VII,"Went to him, where he stood, and answered:"
8272,VII,"No, Mr. Philip,"
8273,VII,"No, you are good, Mr. Philip, and gentle; and I am the foolish:"
8274,VII,"No, Mr. Philip, forgive me."
8275,VII,"She stepped right to him, and boldly"
8276,VII,"Took up his hand, and placed it in hers: he dared no movement;"
8277,VII,"Took up the cold hanging hand, up-forcing the heavy elbow."
8278,VII,"I am afraid, she said, but I will; and kissed the fingers."
8279,VII,And he fell on his knees and kissed her own past counting.
8280,VII,
8281,VII,But a revulsion wrought in the brain and bosom of Elspie;
8282,VII,"And the passion she just had compared to the vehement ocean,"
8283,VII,Urging in high spring-tide its masterful way through the mountains
8284,VII,"Forcing and flooding the silvery stream, as it runs from the inland;"
8285,VII,"That great power withdrawn, receding here and passive,"
8286,VII,"Felt she in myriad springs, her sources far in the mountains,"
8287,VII,"Stirring, collecting, rising, upheaving, forth-outflowing,"
8288,VII,"Taking and joining, right welcome, that delicate rill in the valley,"
8289,VII,"Filling it, making it strong, and still descending, seeking,"
8290,VII,"With a blind forefeeling descending ever, and seeking,"
8291,VII,"With a delicious forefeeling, the great still sea before it;"
8292,VII,"There deep into it, far, to carry, and lose in its bosom,"
8293,VII,Waters that still from their sources exhaustless are fain to be added
8294,VII,"As he was kissing her fingers, and knelt on the ground before her,"
8295,VII,"Yielding backward she sank to her seat, and of what she was doing"
8296,VII,"Ignorant, bewildered, in sweet multitudinous vague emotion,"
8297,VII,"Stooping, knowing not what, put her lips to the hair on his forehead:"
8298,VII,"And Philip, raising himself, gently, for the first time round her"
8299,VII,"Passing his arms, close, close, enfolded her, close to his bosom."
8300,VII,"As they went home by the moon, Forgive me, Philip, she whispered;"
8301,VII,"I have so many things to think of, all of a sudden;"
8302,VII,"I who had never once thought a thing,—in my ignorant Highlands."
8303,VII,
8304,VII,
8305,VIII.,VIII.
8306,VIII.,
8307,VIII.,"_Jam veniet virgo, jam dicetur Hymenæus._"
8308,VIII.,
8309,VIII.,"But a revulsion again came over the spirit of Elspie,"
8310,VIII.,"When she thought of his wealth, his birth and education:"
8311,VIII.,"Wealth indeed but small, though to her a difference truly;"
8312,VIII.,"Father nor mother had Philip, a thousand pounds his portion,"
8313,VIII.,Somewhat impaired in a world where nothing is had for nothing;
8314,VIII.,"Fortune indeed but small, and prospects plain and simple."
8315,VIII.,"But the many things that he knew, and the ease of a practised"
8316,VIII.,"Intellect’s motion, and all those indefinable graces"
8317,VIII.,"(Were they not hers, too, Philip?) to speech, and manner, and movement,"
8318,VIII.,"Lent by the knowledge of self, and wisely instructed feeling,—"
8319,VIII.,"When she thought of these, and these contemplated daily,"
8320,VIII.,"Daily appreciating more, and more exactly appraising,—"
8321,VIII.,"With these thoughts, and the terror withal of a thing she could not"
8322,VIII.,"Estimate, and of a step (such a step!) in the dark to be taken,"
8323,VIII.,"Terror nameless and ill-understood of deserting her station,—"
8324,VIII.,"Daily heavier, heavier upon her pressed the sorrow,"
8325,VIII.,"Daily distincter, distincter within her arose the conviction,"
8326,VIII.,"He was too high, too perfect, and she so unfit, so unworthy,"
8327,VIII.,"(Ah me! Philip, that ever a word such as that should be written!)"
8328,VIII.,"It would do neither for him nor for her; she also was something,"
8329,VIII.,"Not much indeed, it was true, yet not to be lightly extinguished"
8330,VIII.,"Should _he_—_he_, she said, have a wife beneath him? herself be"
8331,VIII.,An inferior there where only equality can be?
8332,VIII.,It would do neither for him nor for her.
8333,VIII.,Alas for Philip!
8334,VIII.,Many were tears and great was perplexity. Nor had availed then
8335,VIII.,All his prayer and all his device. But much was spoken
8336,VIII.,"Now, between Adam and Elspie: companions were they hourly:"
8337,VIII.,"Much by Elspie to Adam, inquiring, anxiously seeking,"
8338,VIII.,From his experience seeking impartial accurate statement
8339,VIII.,"What it was to do this or do that, go hither or thither,"
8340,VIII.,How in the after-life would seem what now seeming certain
8341,VIII.,Might so soon be reversed; in her quest and obscure exploring
8342,VIII.,Still from that quiet orb soliciting light to her footsteps;
8343,VIII.,"Much by Elspie to Adam, inquiringly, eagerly seeking:"
8344,VIII.,"Much by Adam to Elspie, informing, reassuring,"
8345,VIII.,"Much that was sweet to Elspie, by Adam heedfully speaking,"
8346,VIII.,"Quietly, indirectly, in general terms, of Philip,"
8347,VIII.,"Gravely, but indirectly, not as incognisant wholly,"
8348,VIII.,"But as suspending until she should seek it, direct intimation;"
8349,VIII.,"Much that was sweet in her heart of what he was and would be,"
8350,VIII.,"Much that was strength to her mind, confirming beliefs and insights"
8351,VIII.,"Pure and unfaltering, but young and mute and timid for action:"
8352,VIII.,"Much of relations of rich and poor, and of true education."
8353,VIII.,"It was on Saturday eve, in the gorgeous bright October,"
8354,VIII.,"Then when brackens are changed, and heather blooms are faded,"
8355,VIII.,And amid russet of heather and fern green trees are bonnie;
8356,VIII.,"Alders are green, and oaks; the rowan scarlet and yellow;"
8357,VIII.,"One great glory of broad gold pieces appears the aspen,"
8358,VIII.,"And the jewels of gold that were hung in the hair of the birch-tree,"
8359,VIII.,"Pendulous, here and there, her coronet, necklace, and ear-rings,"
8360,VIII.,"Cover her now, o’er and o’er; she is weary and scatters them from her."
8361,VIII.,"There, upon Saturday eve, in the gorgeous bright October,"
8362,VIII.,"Under the alders knitting, gave Elspie her troth to Philip,"
8363,VIII.,"For as they talked, anon she said,"
8364,VIII.,"It is well, Mr. Philip."
8365,VIII.,"Yes, it is well: I have spoken, and learnt a deal with the teacher."
8366,VIII.,"At the last I told him all, I could not help it;"
8367,VIII.,And it came easier with him than could have been with my father;
8368,VIII.,"And he calmly approved, as one that had fully considered."
8369,VIII.,"Yes, it is well, I have hoped, though quite too great and sudden;"
8370,VIII.,"I am so fearful, I think it ought not to be for years yet."
8371,VIII.,I am afraid; but believe in you; and I trust to the teacher;
8372,VIII.,"You have done all things gravely and temperate, not as in passion;"
8373,VIII.,"And the teacher is prudent, and surely can tell what is likely."
8374,VIII.,"What my father will say, I know not; we will obey him:"
8375,VIII.,"But for myself, I could dare to believe all well, and venture."
8376,VIII.,"O Mr. Philip, may it never hereafter seem to be different!"
8377,VIII.,And she hid her face—
8378,VIII.,"Oh, where, but in Philip’s bosom!"
8379,VIII.,
8380,VIII.,"After some silence, some tears too perchance, Philip laughed, and said"
8381,VIII.,"to her,"
8382,VIII.,"So, my own Elspie, at last you are clear that I’m bad enough for you"
8383,VIII.,Ah! but your father won’t make one half the question about it
8384,VIII.,"You have—he’ll think me, I know, nor better nor worse than Donald,"
8385,VIII.,"Neither better nor worse for my gentlemanship and bookwork,"
8386,VIII.,"Worse, I fear, as he knows me an idle and vagabond fellow,"
8387,VIII.,"Though he allows, but he’ll think it was all for your sake, Elspie,"
8388,VIII.,Though he allows I did some good at the end of the shearing.
8389,VIII.,But I had thought in Scotland you didn’t care for this folly.
8390,VIII.,"How I wish, he said, you had lived all your days in the Highlands!"
8391,VIII.,This is what comes of the year you spent in our foolish England.
8392,VIII.,You do not all of you feel these fancies.
8393,VIII.,"No, she answered."
8394,VIII.,And in her spirit the freedom and ancient joy was reviving.
8395,VIII.,"No, she said, and uplifted herself, and looked for her knitting,"
8396,VIII.,"No, nor do _I_, dear Philip, I don’t myself feel always"
8397,VIII.,"As I have felt, more sorrow for me, these four days lately,"
8398,VIII.,"Like the Peruvian Indians I read about last winter,"
8399,VIII.,"Out in America there, in somebody’s life of Pizarro;"
8400,VIII.,Who were as good perhaps as the Spaniards; only weaker;
8401,VIII.,"And that the one big tree might spread its root and branches,"
8402,VIII.,All the lesser about it must even be felled and perish.
8403,VIII.,"No, I feel much more as if I, as well as you, were,"
8404,VIII.,"Somewhere, a leaf on the one great tree, that, up from old time"
8405,VIII.,"Growing, contains in itself the whole of the virtue and life of"
8406,VIII.,"Bygone days, drawing now to itself all kindreds and nations"
8407,VIII.,And must have for itself the whole world for its root and branches.
8408,VIII.,"No, I belong to the tree, I shall not decay in the shadow;"
8409,VIII.,"Yes, and I feel the life-juices of all the world and the ages,"
8410,VIII.,"Coming to me as to you, more slowly no doubt and poorer:"
8411,VIII.,"You are more near, but then you will help to convey them to me."
8412,VIII.,"No, don’t smile, Philip, now, so scornfully! While you look so"
8413,VIII.,"Scornful and strong, I feel as if I were standing and trembling,"
8414,VIII.,Fancying the burn in the dark a wide and rushing river;
8415,VIII.,"And I feel coming unto me from you, or it may be from elsewhere,"
8416,VIII.,"Strong contemptuous resolve; I forget, and I bound as across it."
8417,VIII.,"But after all, you know, it may be a dangerous river."
8418,VIII.,"Oh, if it were so, Elspie, he said, I can carry you over."
8419,VIII.,"Nay, she replied, you would tire of having me for a burden."
8420,VIII.,"O sweet burden, he said, and are you not light as a feather?"
8421,VIII.,"But it is deep, very likely, she said, over head and ears too."
8422,VIII.,"O let us try, he answered, the waters themselves will support us,"
8423,VIII.,"Yea, very ripples and waves will form to a boat underneath us;"
8424,VIII.,"There is a boat, he said, and a name is written upon it,"
8425,VIII.,"Love, he said, and kissed her.—"
8426,VIII.,"But I will read your books, though,"
8427,VIII.,"Said she: you’ll leave me some, Philip?"
8428,VIII.,"Not I, replied he, a volume."
8429,VIII.,"This is the way with you all, I perceive, high and low together."
8430,VIII.,"Women must read, as if they didn’t know all beforehand:"
8431,VIII.,"Weary of plying the pump, we turn to the running water,"
8432,VIII.,And the running spring will needs have a pump built upon it.
8433,VIII.,"Weary and sick of our books, we come to repose in your eyelight,"
8434,VIII.,"As to the woodland and water, the freshness and beauty of Nature."
8435,VIII.,"Lo, you will talk, forsooth, of things we are sick to the death of."
8436,VIII.,"What, she said, and if I have let you become my sweetheart,"
8437,VIII.,"I am to read no books! but you may go your ways then,"
8438,VIII.,"And I will read, she said, with my father at home as I used to."
8439,VIII.,"If you must have it, he said, I myself will read them to you."
8440,VIII.,"Well, she said, but no, I will read to myself, when I choose it;"
8441,VIII.,"What, you suppose we never read anything here in our Highlands,"
8442,VIII.,"Bella and I with the father, in all our winter evenings!"
8443,VIII.,"But we must go, Mr. Philip—"
8444,VIII.,"I shall not go at all, said"
8445,VIII.,"He, if you call me Mr. Thank heaven! that’s over for ever."
8446,VIII.,"No, but it’s not, she said, it is not over, nor will be."
8447,VIII.,"Was it not then, she asked, the name I called you first by?"
8448,VIII.,"No, Mr. Philip, no—you have kissed me enough for two nights;"
8449,VIII.,"No—come, Philip, come, or I’11 go myself without you."
8450,VIII.,"You never call me Philip, he answered, until I kiss you."
8451,VIII.,"As they went home by the moon that waning now rose later,"
8452,VIII.,"Stepping through mossy stones by the runnel under the alders,"
8453,VIII.,"Loitering unconsciously, Philip, she said, I will not be a lady;"
8454,VIII.,We will do work together—you do not wish me a lady.
8455,VIII.,It is a weakness perhaps and a foolishness; still it is so;
8456,VIII.,I have been used all my life to help myself and others;
8457,VIII.,"I could not bear to sit and be waited on by footmen,"
8458,VIII.,"No, not even by women—"
8459,VIII.,"And God forbid, he answered,"
8460,VIII.,"God forbid you should ever be aught but yourself, my Elspie!"
8461,VIII.,"As for service, I love it not, I; your weakness is mine too,"
8462,VIII.,I am sure Adam told you as much as that about me.
8463,VIII.,"I am sure, she said, he called you wild and flighty."
8464,VIII.,"That was true, he said, till my wings were clipped. But, my Elspie,"
8465,VIII.,"You will at least just go and see my uncle and cousins,"
8466,VIII.,"Sister, and brother, and brother’s wife. You should go, if you liked it,"
8467,VIII.,"Just as you are; just what you are, at any rate, my Elspie."
8468,VIII.,"Yes, we will go, and give the old solemn gentility stage-play"
8469,VIII.,"One little look, to leave it with all the more satisfaction."
8470,VIII.,"That may be, my Philip, she said; you are good to think of it."
8471,VIII.,"But we are letting our fancies run on indeed; after all, it"
8472,VIII.,"May all come, you know, Mr. Philip, to nothing whatever,"
8473,VIII.,"There is so much that needs to be done, so much that may happen."
8474,VIII.,"All that needs to be done, said he, shall be done, and quickly."
8475,VIII.,"And on the morrow he took good heart, and spoke with David."
8476,VIII.,"Not unwarned the father, nor had been unperceiving:"
8477,VIII.,"Fearful much, but in all from the first reassured by the Tutor."
8478,VIII.,And he remembered how he had fancied the lad from the first; and
8479,VIII.,"Then, too, the old man’s eye was much more for inner than outer,"
8480,VIII.,And the natural tune of his heart without misgiving
8481,VIII.,"Went to the noble words of that grand song of the Lowlands,"
8482,VIII.,"_Rank is the guinea stamp, but the man’s a man for a’ that_."
8483,VIII.,"Still he was doubtful, would hear nothing of it now, but insisted"
8484,VIII.,"Philip should go to his books; if he chose, he might write; if after"
8485,VIII.,"Chose to return, might come; he truly believed him honest."
8486,VIII.,"But a year must elapse, and many things might happen."
8487,VIII.,"Yet at the end he burst into tears, called Elspie, and blessed them:"
8488,VIII.,"Elspie, my bairn, he said, I thought not when at the doorway"
8489,VIII.,"Standing with you, and telling the young man where he would find us,"
8490,VIII.,I did not think he would one day be asking me here to surrender
8491,VIII.,What is to me more than wealth in my Bothie of Tober-na-vuolich.
8492,VIII.,
8493,VIII.,
8494,IX,IX
8495,IX,
8496,IX,"_Arva, beata Petamus arva!_"
8497,IX,
8498,IX,"So on the morrow’s morrow, with Term-time dread returning,"
8499,IX,"Philip returned to his books, and read, and remained at Oxford,"
8500,IX,All the Christmas and Easter remained and read at Oxford.
8501,IX,Great was wonder in College when postman showed to butler
8502,IX,"Letters addressed to David Mackaye, at Tober-na-vuolich,"
8503,IX,"Letter on letter, at least one a week, one every Sunday:"
8504,IX,"Great at that Highland post was wonder too and conjecture,"
8505,IX,"When the postman showed letters to wife, and wife to the lassies,"
8506,IX,And the lassies declared they couldn’t be really to David;
8507,IX,"Yes, they could see inside a paper with E. upon it."
8508,IX,"Great was surmise in College at breakfast, wine, and supper,"
8509,IX,"Keen the conjecture and joke; but Adam kept the secret,"
8510,IX,"Adam the secret kept, and Philip read like fury."
8511,IX,This is a letter written by Philip at Christmas to Adam.
8512,IX,"There may be beings, perhaps, whose vocation it is to be idle,"
8513,IX,"Idle, sumptuous even, luxurious, if it must be:"
8514,IX,Only let each man seek to be that for which nature meant him.
8515,IX,"If you were meant to plough, Lord Marquis, out with you, and do it;"
8516,IX,"If you were meant to be idle, O beggar, behold, I will feed you."
8517,IX,"If you were born for a groom, and you seem, by your dress, to believe so,"
8518,IX,"Do it like a man, Sir George, for pay, in a livery stable;"
8519,IX,"Yes, you may so release that slip of a boy at the corner,"
8520,IX,"Fingering books at the window, misdoubting the eighth commandment."
8521,IX,"Ah, fair Lady Maria, God meant you to live and be lovely;"
8522,IX,"Be so then, and I bless you. But ye, ye spurious ware, who"
8523,IX,"Might be plain women, and can be by no possibility better!"
8524,IX,"—Ye unhappy statuettes, and miserable trinkets,"
8525,IX,"Poor alabaster chimney-piece ornaments under glass cases,"
8526,IX,"Come, in God’s name, come down! the very French clock by you"
8527,IX,Puts you to shame with ticking; the fire-irons deride you.
8528,IX,"You, young girl, who have had such advantages, learnt so quickly,"
8529,IX,"Can you not teach? O yes, and she likes Sunday-school extremely,"
8530,IX,"Only it’s soon in the morning. Away! if to teach be your calling,"
8531,IX,"It is no play, but a business: off! go teach and be paid for it."
8532,IX,"Lady Sophia’s so good to the sick, so firm and so gentle."
8533,IX,Is there a nobler sphere than of hospital nurse and matron?
8534,IX,"Hast thou for cooking a turn, little Lady Clarissa? in with them,"
8535,IX,"In with your fingers! their beauty it spoils, but your own it enhances"
8536,IX,For it is beautiful only to do the thing we are meant for.
8537,IX,"This was the answer that came from the Tutor, the grave man, Adam"
8538,IX,"When the armies are set in array, and the battle beginning,"
8539,IX,Is it well that the soldier whose post is far to the leftward
8540,IX,"Say, I will go to the right, it is there I shall do best service?"
8541,IX,"There is a great Field-Marshal, my friend, who arrays our battalions;"
8542,IX,"Let us to Providence trust, and abide and work in our stations."
8543,IX,"This was the final retort from the eager, impetuous Philip."
8544,IX,I am sorry to say your Providence puzzles me sadly;
8545,IX,"Children of Circumstance are we to be? you answer, On no wise!"
8546,IX,"Where does Circumstance end, and Providence, where begins it?"
8547,IX,"What are we to resist, and what are we to be friends with?"
8548,IX,"If there is battle, ’tis battle by night, I stand in the darkness,"
8549,IX,"Here in the mêlée of men, Ionian and Dorian on both sides,"
8550,IX,Signal and password known; which is friend and which is foeman?
8551,IX,"Is it a friend? I doubt, though he speak with the voice of a brother."
8552,IX,"Still you are right, I suppose; you always are, and will be;"
8553,IX,"Though I mistrust the Field-Marshal, I bow to the duty of order."
8554,IX,"Yet is my feeling rather to ask, where is the battle?"
8555,IX,"Yes, I could find in my heart to cry, notwithstanding my Elspie,"
8556,IX,O that the armies indeed were arrayed! O joy of the onset!
8557,IX,"Sound, thou Trumpet of God, come forth, Great Cause, to array us,"
8558,IX,"King and leader appear, thy soldiers sorrowing seek thee."
8559,IX,"Would that the armies indeed were arrayed, O where is the battle!"
8560,IX,"Neither battle I see, nor arraying, nor King in Israel,"
8561,IX,"Only infinite jumble and mess and dislocation,"
8562,IX,"Backed by a solemn appeal, ‘For God’s sake, do not stir, there!’"
8563,IX,"Yet you are right, I suppose; if you don’t attack my conclusion,"
8564,IX,"Let us get on as we can, and do the thing we are fit for;"
8565,IX,"Every one for himself, and the common success for us all, and"
8566,IX,"Thankful, if not for our own, why then for the triumph of others,"
8567,IX,"Get along, each as we can, and do the thing we are meant for."
8568,IX,"That isn’t likely to be by sitting still, eating and drinking."
8569,IX,These are fragments again without date addressed to Adam.
8570,IX,"As at return of tide the total weight of ocean,"
8571,IX,"Drawn by moon and sun from Labrador and Greenland,"
8572,IX,"Sets-in amain, in the open space betwixt Mull and Scarba,"
8573,IX,"Heaving, swelling, spreading the might of the mighty Atlantic;"
8574,IX,"There into cranny and slit of the rocky, cavernous bottom"
8575,IX,"Settles down, and with dimples huge the smooth sea-surface"
8576,IX,"Eddies, coils, and whirls; by dangerous Corryvreckan:"
8577,IX,"So in my soul of souls, through its cells and secret recesses,"
8578,IX,"Comes back, swelling and spreading, the old democratic fervour."
8579,IX,"But as the light of day enters some populous city,"
8580,IX,"Shaming away, ere it come, by the chilly day-streak signal,"
8581,IX,"High and low, the misusers of night, shaming out the gas-lamps—"
8582,IX,"All the great empty streets are flooded with broadening clearness,"
8583,IX,"Which, withal, by inscrutable simultaneous access"
8584,IX,Permeates far and pierces to the very cellars lying in
8585,IX,"Narrow high back-lane, and court, and alley of alleys:—"
8586,IX,"He that goes forth to his walks, while speeding to the suburb,"
8587,IX,Sees sights only peaceful and pure: as labourers settling
8588,IX,"Slowly to work, in their limbs the lingering sweetness of slumber;"
8589,IX,"Humble market-carts, coming in, bringing in, not only"
8590,IX,"Flower, fruit, farm-store, but sounds and sights of the country"
8591,IX,Dwelling yet on the sense of the dreamy drivers; soon after
8592,IX,Half-awake servant-maids unfastening drowsy shutters
8593,IX,"Up at the windows, or down, letting-in the air by the doorway;"
8594,IX,"School-boys, school-girls soon, with slate, portfolio, satchel,"
8595,IX,"Hampered as they haste, those running, these others maidenly tripping,"
8596,IX,"Early clerk anon turning out to stroll, or it may be"
8597,IX,Meet his sweetheart—waiting behind the garden gate there;
8598,IX,Merchant on his grass-plat haply bare-headed; and now by this time
8599,IX,Little child bringing breakfast to ‘father’ that sits on the timber
8600,IX,"There by the scaffolding; see, she waits for the can beside him;"
8601,IX,Meantime above purer air untarnished of new-lit fires:
8602,IX,So that the whole great wicked artificial civilised fabric—
8603,IX,"All its unfinished houses, lots for sale, and railway out-works—"
8604,IX,"Seems reaccepted, resumed to Primal Nature and Beauty:—"
8605,IX,"—Such—in me, and to me, and on me the love of Elspie!"
8606,IX,"Philip returned to his books, but returned to his Highlands after;"
8607,IX,"Got a first, ’tis said; a winsome bride, ’tis certain."
8608,IX,"There while courtship was ending, nor yet the wedding appointed,"
8609,IX,Under her father he studied the handling of hoe and of hatchet:
8610,IX,Thither that summer succeeding came Adam and Arthur to see him
8611,IX,"Down by the lochs from the distant Glenmorison; Adam the tutor,"
8612,IX,"Arthur, and Hope; and the Piper anon who was there for a visit;"
8613,IX,He had been into the schools; plucked almost; all but a _gone-coon_;
8614,IX,So he declared; never once had brushed up his _hairy_ Aldrich;
8615,IX,Into the great might-have-been upsoaring sublime and ideal
8616,IX,Gave to historical questions a free poetical treatment;
8617,IX,"Leaving vocabular ghosts undisturbed in their lexicon-limbo,"
8618,IX,Took Aristophanes up at a shot; and the whole three last weeks
8619,IX,"Went, in his life and the sunshine rejoicing, to Nuneham and Godstowe:"
8620,IX,What were the claims of Degree to those of life and the sunshine?
8621,IX,"There did the four find Philip, the poet, the speaker, the Chartist,"
8622,IX,"Delving at Highland soil, and railing at Highland landlords,"
8623,IX,"Railing, but more, as it seemed, for the fun of the Piper’s fury."
8624,IX,"There saw they David and Elspie Mackaye, and the Piper was almost"
8625,IX,Almost deeply in love with Bella the sister of Elspie;
8626,IX,But the good Adam was heedful: they did not go too often.
8627,IX,"There in the bright October, the gorgeous bright October,"
8628,IX,"When the brackens are changed, and heather blooms are faded,"
8629,IX,"And amid russet of heather and fern green trees are bonnie,"
8630,IX,"Alders are green, and oaks, the rowan scarlet and yellow,"
8631,IX,"Heavy the aspen, and heavy with jewels of gold the birch-tree,"
8632,IX,"There, when shearing had ended, and barley-stooks were garnered,"
8633,IX,"David gave Philip to wife his daughter, his darling Elspie;"
8634,IX,"Elspie the quiet, the brave, was wedded to Philip the poet."
8635,IX,"So won Philip his bride. They are married and gone—But oh, Thou"
8636,IX,"Mighty one, Muse of great Epos, and Idyll the playful and tender,"
8637,IX,"Be it recounted in song, ere we part, and thou fly to thy Pindus,"
8638,IX,"(Pindus is it, O Muse, or Ætna, or even Ben-nevis?)"
8639,IX,"Be it recounted in song, O Muse of the Epos and Idyll,"
8640,IX,"Who gave what at the wedding, the gifts and fair gratulations."
8641,IX,"Adam, the grave careful Adam, a medicine chest and tool-box,"
8642,IX,"Hope a saddle, and Arthur a plough, and the Piper a rifle,"
8643,IX,"Airlie a necklace for Elspie, and Hobbes a Family Bible,"
8644,IX,"Airlie a necklace, and Hobbes a Bible and iron bedstead."
8645,IX,"What was the letter, O Muse, sent withal by the corpulent hero?"
8646,IX,This is the letter of Hobbes the kilted and corpulent hero.
8647,IX,"So the last speech and confession is made, O my eloquent speaker!"
8648,IX,"So _the good time_ is _coming_, or come is it? O my Chartist!"
8649,IX,"So the cathedral is finished at last, O my Pugin of women;"
8650,IX,"Finished, and now, is it true? to be taken out whole to New Zealand!"
8651,IX,"Well, go forth to thy field, to thy barley, with Ruth, O Boaz,"
8652,IX,"Ruth, who for thee hath deserted her people, her gods, her mountains."
8653,IX,"Go, as in Ephrath of old, in the gate of Bethlehem said they,"
8654,IX,"Go, be the wife in thy house both Rachel and Leah unto thee;"
8655,IX,"Be thy wedding of silver, albeit of iron thy bedstead!"
8656,IX,"Yea, to the full golden fifty renewed be! and fair memoranda"
8657,IX,Happily fill the fly-leaves duly left in the Family Bible.
8658,IX,"Live, and when Hobbes is forgotten, may’st thou, an unroasted Grand-sire,"
8659,IX,"See thy children’s children, and Democracy upon New Zealand!"
8660,IX,"This was the letter of Hobbes, and this the postscript after."
8661,IX,"Wit in the letter will prate, but wisdom speaks in a postscript;"
8662,IX,"Listen to wisdom—_Which things_—you perhaps didn’t know, my dear fellow,"
8663,IX,"I have reflected; _Which things are an allegory_, Philip."
8664,IX,"For this Rachel-and-Leah is marriage; which, I have seen it,"
8665,IX,"Lo, and have known it, is always, and must be, bigamy only,"
8666,IX,"Even in noblest kind a duality, compound, and complex,"
8667,IX,"One part heavenly-ideal, the other vulgar and earthy:"
8668,IX,"For this Rachel-and-Leah is marriage, and Laban, their father,"
8669,IX,"Circumstance, chance, the world, our uncle and hard task-master."
8670,IX,Rachel we found as we fled from the daughters of Heth by the desert
8671,IX,"Rachel we met at the well; we came, we saw, we kissed her;"
8672,IX,"Rachel we serve-for, long years,—that seem as a few days only,"
8673,IX,"E’en for the love we have to her,—and win her at last of Laban."
8674,IX,Is it not Rachel we take in our joy from the hand of her father?
8675,IX,Is it not Rachel we lead in the mystical veil from the altar?
8676,IX,"Rachel we dream-of at night: in the morning, behold, it is Leah."
8677,IX,"‘Nay, it is custom,’ saith Laban, the Leah indeed is the elder."
8678,IX,"Happy and wise who consents to redouble his service to Laban,"
8679,IX,"So, fulfilling her week, he may add to the elder the younger,"
8680,IX,"Not repudiates Leah, but wins the Rachel unto her!"
8681,IX,"Neither hate thou thy Leah, my Jacob, she also is worthy;"
8682,IX,"So, many days shall thy Rachel have joy, and survive her sister;"
8683,IX,"Yea, and her children—_Which things are an allegory_, Philip,"
8684,IX,"Aye, and by Origen’s head with a vengeance truly, a long one!"
8685,IX,"This was a note from the Tutor, the grave man, nick-named Adam."
8686,IX,"I shall see you of course, my Philip, before your departure"
8687,IX,"Joy be with you, my boy, with you and your beautiful Elspie."
8688,IX,"Happy is he that found, and finding was not heedless;"
8689,IX,"Happy is he that found, and happy the friend that was with him."
8690,IX,So won Philip his bride:—
8691,IX,They are married and gone to New Zealand.
8692,IX,"Five hundred pounds in pocket, with books, and two or three pictures,"
8693,IX,"Tool-box, plough, and the rest, they rounded the sphere to New Zealand."
8694,IX,"There he hewed, and dug; subdued the earth and his spirit;"
8695,IX,"There he built him a home; there Elspie bare him his children,"
8696,IX,David and Bella; perhaps ere this too an Elspie or Adam;
8697,IX,"There hath he farmstead and land, and fields of corn and flax fields;"
8698,IX,And the Antipodes too have a Bothie of Tober-na-vuolich.

9430,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Yes, we are fighting at last, it appears. This morning as usual,"
9431,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"_Murray_, as usual, in hand, I enter the Caffè Nuovo;"
9432,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Seating myself with a sense as it were of a change in the weather,"
9433,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Not understanding, however, but thinking mostly of Murray,"
9434,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"And, for to-day is their day, of the Campidoglio Marbles;"
9435,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"_Caffè-latte_! I call to the waiter,—and _Non c’ è latte_,"
9436,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"This is the answer he makes me, and this is the sign of a battle."
9437,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,So I sit: and truly they seem to think any one else more
9438,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Worthy than me of attention. I wait for my milkless _nero_,"
9439,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Free to observe undistracted all sorts and sizes of persons,"
9440,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Blending civilian and soldier in strangest costume, coming in, and"
9441,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Gulping in hottest haste, still standing, their coffee,—withdrawing"
9442,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Eagerly, jangling a sword on the steps, or jogging a musket"
9443,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Slung to the shoulder behind. They are fewer, moreover, than usual,"
9444,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Much and silenter far; and so I begin to imagine
9445,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Something is really afloat. Ere I leave, the Caffè is empty,"
9446,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Empty too the streets, in all its length the Corso"
9447,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Empty, and empty I see to my right and left the Condotti."
9448,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Twelve o’clock, on the Pincian Hill, with lots of English,"
9449,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Germans, Americans, French,—the Frenchmen, too, are protected,—"
9450,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"So we stand in the sun, but afraid of a probable shower;"
9451,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"So we stand and stare, and see, to the left of St. Peter’s,"
9452,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Smoke, from the cannon, white,—but that is at intervals only,—"
9453,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Black, from a burning house, we suppose, by the Cavalleggieri;"
9454,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,And we believe we discern some lines of men descending
9455,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Down through the vineyard-slopes, and catch a bayonet gleaming."
9456,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Every ten minutes, however,—in this there is no misconception,—"
9457,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Comes a great white puff from behind Michel Angelo’s dome, and"
9458,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"After a space the report of a real big gun,—not the Frenchman’s!—"
9459,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,That must be doing some work. And so we watch and conjecture.
9460,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Shortly, an Englishman comes, who says he has been to St. Peter’s,"
9461,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Seen the Piazza and troops, but that is all he can tell us;"
9462,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"So we watch and sit, and, indeed, it begins to be tiresome.—"
9463,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"All this smoke is outside; when it has come to the inside,"
9464,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"It will be time, perhaps, to descend and retreat to our houses."
9465,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Half-past one, or two. The report of small arms frequent,"
9466,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Sharp and savage indeed; that cannot all be for nothing:
9467,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"So we watch and wonder; but guessing is tiresome, very."
9468,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Weary of wondering, watching, and guessing, and gossiping idly,"
9469,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Down I go, and pass through the quiet streets with the knots of"
9470,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"National Guards patrolling, and flags hanging out at the windows,"
9471,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"English, American, Danish,—and, after offering to help an"
9472,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Irish family moving _en masse_ to the Maison Serny,"
9473,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,After endeavouring idly to minister balm to the trembling
9474,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Quinquagenarian fears of two lone British spinsters,"
9475,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Go to make sure of my dinner before the enemy enter.
9476,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,But by this there are signs of stragglers returning; and voices
9477,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Talk, though you don’t believe it, of guns and prisoners taken;"
9478,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,And on the walls you read the first bulletin of the morning.—
9479,V. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"This is all that I saw, and all I know of the battle."

9488,VI. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Victory! Victory! Victory!—Ah, but it is, believe me,"
9489,VI. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Easier, easier far, to intone the chant of the martyr"
9490,VI. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Than to indite any pæan of any victory. Death may
9491,VI. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Sometimes be noble; but life, at the best, will appear an illusion."
9492,VI. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"While the great pain is upon us, it is great; when it is over,"
9493,VI. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Why, it is over. The smoke of the sacrifice rises to heaven,"
9494,VI. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Of a sweet savour, no doubt, to Somebody; but on the altar,"
9495,VI. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Lo, there is nothing remaining but ashes and dirt and ill odour."
9496,VI. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"So it stands, you perceive; the labial muscles that swelled with"

9507,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Yes, I suppose I have; although I can hardly be certain,"
9508,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,And in a court of justice could never declare I had seen it.
9509,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"But a man was killed, I am told, in a place where I saw"
9510,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Something; a man was killed, I am told, and I saw something."
9511,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"I was returning home from St. Peter’s; Murray, as usual,"
9512,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Under my arm, I remember; had crossed the St. Angelo bridge; and"
9513,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Moving towards the Condotti, had got to the first barricade, when"
9514,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Gradually, thinking still of St. Peter’s, I became conscious"
9515,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Of a sensation of movement opposing me,—tendency this way"
9516,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,(Such as one fancies may be in a stream when the wave of the tide is
9517,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Coming and not yet come,—a sort of noise and retention);"
9518,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"So I turned, and, before I turned, caught sight of stragglers"
9519,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Heading a crowd, it is plain, that is coming behind that corner."
9520,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Looking up, I see windows filled with heads; the Piazza,"
9521,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Into which you remember the Ponte St. Angelo enters,"
9522,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Since I passed, has thickened with curious groups; and now the"
9523,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Crowd is coming, has turned, has crossed that last barricade, is"
9524,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Here at my side. In the middle they drag at something. What is it?
9525,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Ha! bare swords in the air, held up? There seem to be voices"
9526,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Pleading and hands putting back; official, perhaps; but the swords are"
9527,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Many, and bare in the air. In the air? they descend; they are smiting,"
9528,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Hewing, chopping—At what? In the air once more upstretched? And—"
9529,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Is it blood that’s on them? Yes, certainly blood! Of whom, then?"
9530,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Over whom is the cry of this furor of exultation?
9531,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"While they are skipping and screaming, and dancing their caps on the"
9532,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,points of
9533,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Swords and bayonets, I to the outskirts back, and ask a"
9534,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Mercantile-seeming bystander, ‘What is it?’ and he, looking always"
9535,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"That way, makes me answer, ‘A Priest, who was trying to fly to"
9536,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"The Neapolitan army,’—and thus explains the proceeding."
9537,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,You didn’t see the dead man? No;—I began to be doubtful;
9538,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"I was in black myself, and didn’t know what mightn’t happen,—"
9539,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"But a National Guard close by me, outside of the hubbub,"
9540,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Broke his sword with slashing a broad hat covered with dust,—and"
9541,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Passing away from the place with Murray under my arm, and"
9542,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Stooping, I saw through the legs of the people the legs of a body."
9543,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"You are the first, do you know, to whom I have mentioned the matter."
9544,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Whom should I tell it to else?—these girls?—the Heavens forbid it!—
9545,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Quidnuncs at Monaldini’s?—Idlers upon the Pincian?
9546,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"If I rightly remember, it happened on that afternoon when"
9547,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Word of the nearer approach of a new Neapolitan army
9548,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"First was spread. I began to bethink me of Paris Septembers,"
9549,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Thought I could fancy the look of that old ’Ninety-two. On that evening
9550,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Three or four, or, it may be, five, of these people were slaughtered."
9551,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Some declared they had, one of them, fired on a sentinel; others"
9552,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Say they were only escaping; a Priest, it is currently stated,"
9553,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,Stabbed a National Guard on the very Piazza Colonna:
9554,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"History, Rumour of Rumours, I leave to thee to determine!"
9555,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,But I am thankful to say the government seems to have strength to
9556,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Put it down; it has vanished, at least; the place is most peaceful."
9557,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Through the Trastevere walking last night, at nine of the clock, I"
9558,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"Found no sort of disorder; I crossed by the Island-bridges,"
9559,VII. CLAUDE TO EUSTACE.,"So by the narrow streets to the Ponte Rotto, and onwards"

10149,CANTO IV.,"And from Como went by the boat,—perhaps to the Splügen,—"

10188,CANTO IV.,Somewhere amid their folds she passes whom fain I would follow;
10189,CANTO IV.,Somewhere among those heights she haply calls me to seek her.
10190,CANTO IV.,"Ah, could I hear her call! could I catch the glimpse of her raiment!"
10191,CANTO IV.,"Turn, however, I must, though it seem I turn to desert her;"
10192,CANTO IV.,"For the sense of the thing is simply to hurry to Florence,"

10200,CANTO IV.,How have you travelled? I wonder;—was Mr. Claude your companion?
10201,CANTO IV.,"As for ourselves, we went from Como straight to Lugano;"
10202,CANTO IV.,"So by the Mount St. Gothard; we meant to go by Porlezza,"
10203,CANTO IV.,"Taking the steamer, and stopping, as you had advised, at Bellaggio,"
10204,CANTO IV.,"Two or three days or more; but this was suddenly altered,"
10205,CANTO IV.,"After we left the hotel, on the very way to the steamer."
10206,CANTO IV.,"So we have seen, I fear, not one of the lakes in perfection."
10207,CANTO IV.,"Well, he is not come, and now, I suppose, he will not come."
10208,CANTO IV.,"What will you think, meantime? and yet I must really confess it;—"
10209,CANTO IV.,"What will you say? I wrote him a note. We left in a hurry,"
10210,CANTO IV.,"Went from Milan to Como, three days before we expected."
10211,CANTO IV.,"But I thought, if he came all the way to Milan, he really"
10212,CANTO IV.,Ought not to be disappointed: and so I wrote three lines to
10213,CANTO IV.,"Say I had heard he was coming, desirous of joining our party;—"
10214,CANTO IV.,"If so, then I said, we had started for Como, and meant to"
10215,CANTO IV.,"Cross the St. Gothard, and stay, we believed, at Lucerne, for the summer."
10216,CANTO IV.,"Was it wrong? and why, if it was, has it faded to bring him?"
10217,CANTO IV.,Did he not think it worth while to come to Milan? He knew (you
10218,CANTO IV.,"Told him) the house we should go to. Or may it, perhaps, have miscarried?"

10722,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Of human acts, good, half and half, and bad."
10723,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Serious and calm, yet lurked, I know not why,"
10724,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"At times, a softness in his voice and eye."
10725,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,Some shade of ill a prosperous life had crossed;
10726,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,Married no doubt: a wife or child had lost?
10727,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,He never told us why he passed the sea.
10728,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"My guardian friend was now, at thirty-three,"
10729,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"A rising lawyer—ever, at the best,"
10730,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,Slow rises worth in lawyer’s gown compressed;
10731,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Succeeding now, yet just, and only just,"
10732,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,His new success he never seemed to trust.
10733,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"By nature he to gentlest thoughts inclined,"
10734,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,To most severe had disciplined his mind;
10735,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,He held it duty to be half unkind.
10736,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Bitter, they said, who but the exterior knew;"
10737,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,In friendship never was a friend so true:
10738,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"The unwelcome fact he did not shrink to tell,"
10739,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"The good, if fact, he recognised as well."
10740,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Stout to maintain, if not the first to see;"
10741,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,In conversation who so great as he?
10742,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Leading but seldom, always sure to guide,"
10743,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"To false or silly, if ’twas borne aside,"
10744,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"His quick correction silent he expressed,"
10745,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"And stopped you short, and forced you to your best."
10746,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Often, I think, he suffered from some pain"
10747,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Of mind, that on the body worked again;"
10748,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"One felt it in his sort of half-disdain,"
10749,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Impatient not, but acrid in his speech;"
10750,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,The world with him her lesson failed to teach
10751,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,To take things easily and let them go.
10752,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"He, for what special fitness I scarce know,"
10753,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"For which good quality, or if for all,"
10754,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,With less of reservation and recall
10755,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"And speedier favour than I e’er had seen,"
10756,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Took, as we called him, to the rural dean."
10757,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"As grew the gourd, as grew the stalk of bean,"
10758,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"So swift it seemed, betwixt these differing two"
10759,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,A stately trunk of confidence up-grew.
10760,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,Of marriage long one night they held discourse;
10761,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Regarding it in different ways, of course."
10762,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Marriage is discipline, the wise had said,"
10763,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,A needful human discipline to wed;
10764,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Novels of course depict it final bliss,—"
10765,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Say, had it ever really once been this?"
10766,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Our Yankee friend (whom, ere the night was done,"
10767,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"We called New England or the Pilgrim Son),"
10768,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"A little tired, made bold to interfere;"
10769,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"‘Appeal,’ he said, ‘to me; my sentence hear."
10770,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,You’ll reason on till night and reason fail;
10771,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,My judgment is you each shall tell a tale;
10772,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"And as on marriage you can not agree,"
10773,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,Of love and marriage let the stories be.’
10774,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Sentence delivered, as the younger man,"
10775,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,My lawyer friend was called on and began.
10776,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"‘_Infandum jubes!_ ’tis of long ago,"
10777,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"If tell I must, I tell the tale I know:"
10778,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Yet the first person using for the freak,"
10779,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,Don’t rashly judge that of myself I speak.’
10780,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,So to his tale; if of himself or not
10781,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"I never learnt, we thought so on the spot."
10782,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,"Lightly he told it as a thing of old,"
10783,MARI MAGNO OR TALES ON BOARD.,And lightly I repeat it as he told.

10791,I,I
10792,I,
10793,I,"‘Dearest of boys, please come to-day,"
10794,I,"Papa and mama have bid me say,"
10795,I,They hope you’ll dine with us at three;
10796,I,"They will be out till then, you see,"
10797,I,"But you will start at once, you know,"
10798,I,And come as fast as you can go.
10799,I,Next week they hope you’ll come and stay
10800,I,Some time before you go away.
10801,I,"Dear boy, how pleasant it will be!"
10802,I,Ever your dearest Emily!’
10803,I,"Twelve years of age was I, and she"
10804,I,"Fourteen, when thus she wrote to me,"
10805,I,"A schoolboy, with an uncle spending"
10806,I,"My holidays, then nearly ending."
10807,I,"My uncle lived the mountain o’er,"
10808,I,"A rector, and a bachelor;"
10809,I,"The vicarage was by the sea,"
10810,I,That was the home of Emily:
10811,I,The windows to the front looked down
10812,I,"Across a single-streeted town,"
10813,I,"Far as to where Worms-head was seen,"
10814,I,Dim with ten watery miles between;
10815,I,The Carnedd mountains on the right
10816,I,With stony masses filled the sight;
10817,I,To left the open sea; the bay
10818,I,In a blue plain before you lay.
10819,I,"A garden, full of fruit, extends,"
10820,I,"Stone-walled, above the house, and ends"
10821,I,"With a locked door, that by a porch"
10822,I,Admits to churchyard and to church;
10823,I,"Farm-buildings nearer on one side,"
10824,I,"And glebe, and then the country wide."
10825,I,I and my cousin Emily
10826,I,Were cousins in the third degree;
10827,I,My mother near of kin was reckoned
10828,I,"To hers, who was my mother’s second:"
10829,I,My cousinship I held from her.
10830,I,"Such an amount of girls there were,"
10831,I,At first one really was perplexed:
10832,I,"’Twas Patty first, and Lydia next,"
10833,I,"And Emily the third, and then,"
10834,I,"Philippa, Phœbe, Mary Gwen."
10835,I,"Six were they, you perceive, in all;"
10836,I,"And portraits fading on the wall,"
10837,I,"Grandmothers, heroines of old,"
10838,I,"And aunts of aunts, with scrolls that told"
10839,I,"Their names and dates, were there to show"
10840,I,Why these had all been christened so.
10841,I,The crowd of blooming daughters fair
10842,I,"Scarce let you see the mother there,"
10843,I,"And by her husband, large and tall,"
10844,I,She looked a little shrunk and small;
10845,I,Although my mother used to tell
10846,I,That once she was a county belle:
10847,I,"Busied she seemed, and half-distress’d"
10848,I,For him and them to do the best.
10849,I,"The vicar was of bulk and thewes,"
10850,I,"Six feet he stood within his shoes,"
10851,I,And every inch of all a man;
10852,I,"Ecclesiast on the ancient plan,"
10853,I,Unforced by any party rule
10854,I,His native character to school;
10855,I,"In ancient learning not unread,"
10856,I,But had few doctrines in his head;
10857,I,"Dissenters truly he abhorr’d,"
10858,I,They never had his gracious word.
10859,I,"He ne’er was bitter or unkind,"
10860,I,But positively spoke his mind.
10861,I,"Their piety he could not bear,"
10862,I,A sneaking snivelling set they were:
10863,I,Their tricks and meanness fired his blood;
10864,I,Up for his Church he stoutly stood.
10865,I,No worldly aim had he in life
10866,I,To set him with himself at strife;
10867,I,"A spade a spade he freely named,"
10868,I,"And of his joke was not ashamed,"
10869,I,"Made it and laughed at it, be sure,"
10870,I,"With young and old, and rich and poor."
10871,I,His sermons frequently he took
10872,I,Out of some standard reverend book;
10873,I,"They seemed a little strange, indeed,"
10874,I,But were not likely to mislead.
10875,I,"Others he gave that were his own,"
10876,I,The difference could be quickly known.
10877,I,"Though sorry not to have a boy,"
10878,I,His daughters were his perfect joy;
10879,I,"He plagued them, oft drew tears from each,"
10880,I,Was bold and hasty in his speech;
10881,I,"All through the house you heard him call,"
10882,I,He had his vocatives for all:
10883,I,"Patty Patina, Pat became,"
10884,I,"Lydia took Languish with her name,"
10885,I,"Philippa was the Gentle Queen,"
10886,I,"And Phœbe, Madam Proserpine;"
10887,I,The pseudonyms for Mary Gwen
10888,I,Varied with every week again;
10889,I,"But Emily, of all the set,"
10890,I,"Emilia called, was most the pet."
10891,I,"Soon as her messenger had come,"
10892,I,"I started from my uncle’s home,"
10893,I,On an old pony scrambling down
10894,I,Over the mountain to the town.
10895,I,"My cousins met me at the door,"
10896,I,"And some behind, and some before,"
10897,I,"Kissed me all round and kissed again,"
10898,I,"The happy custom there and then,"
10899,I,From Patty down to Mary Gwen.
10900,I,"Three hours we had, and spent in play"
10901,I,About the garden and the hay;
10902,I,We sat upon the half-built stack;
10903,I,"And when ’twas time for hurrying back,"
10904,I,"Slyly away the others hied,"
10905,I,And took the ladder from the side;
10906,I,"Emily there, alone with me,"
10907,I,Was left in close captivity;
10908,I,"But down the stack at last I slid,"
10909,I,And found the ladder they had hid.
10910,I,I left at six; again I went
10911,I,Soon after and a fortnight spent:
10912,I,"Drawing, by Patty I was taught,"
10913,I,But could not be to music brought;
10914,I,"I showed them how to play at chess,"
10915,I,I argued with the governess;
10916,I,"I called them stupid; why, to me"
10917,I,’Twas evident as A B C;
10918,I,Were not the reasons such and such?
10919,I,"Helston, my schoolfellow, but much"
10920,I,"My senior, in a yacht came o’er,"
10921,I,"His uncle with him, from the shore"
10922,I,Under Worms-head: to take a sail
10923,I,"He pressed them, but could not prevail;"
10924,I,"Mama was timid, durst not go,"
10925,I,Papa was rather gruff with no.
10926,I,"Helston no sooner was afloat,"
10927,I,"We made a party in a boat,"
10928,I,"And rowed to Sea-Mew Island out,"
10929,I,And landed there and roved about:
10930,I,"And I and Emily out of reach,"
10931,I,Strayed from the rest along the beach.
10932,I,Turning to look into a cave
10933,I,"She stood, when suddenly a wave"
10934,I,"Ran up; I caught her by the frock,"
10935,I,"And pulled her out, and o’er a rock,"
10936,I,"So doing, stumbled, rolled, and fell."
10937,I,"She knelt down, I remember well,"
10938,I,"Bid me where I was hurt to tell,"
10939,I,And kissed me three times as I lay;
10940,I,But I jumped up and limped away.
10941,I,The next was my departing day.
10942,I,Patty arranged it all with me
10943,I,To send next year to Emily
10944,I,A valentine. I wrote and sent;
10945,I,For the fourteenth it duly went.
10946,I,On the fourteenth what should there be
10947,I,But one from Emily to me;
10948,I,The postmark left it plain to see.
10949,I,"Mine, though they praised it at the time,"
10950,I,Was but a formal piece of rhyme.
10951,I,She sent me one that she had bought;
10952,I,"’Twas stupid of her, as I thought:"
10953,I,"Why not have written one? She wrote,"
10954,I,"However, soon, this little note."
10955,I,"‘Dearest of boys, of course ’twas you;"
10956,I,"You printed, but your hand I knew,"
10957,I,"And verses too, how did you learn?"
10958,I,I can’t send any in return.
10959,I,Papa declares they are not bad—
10960,I,That’s praise from him—and I’m so glad
10961,I,Because you know no one can be
10962,I,I’d rather have to write to me.
10963,I,"‘Our governess is going away,"
10964,I,We’re so distressed she cannot stay:
10965,I,Mama had made it quite a rule
10966,I,We none of us should go to school.
10967,I,"But what to do they do not know,"
10968,I,Papa protests it must be so.
10969,I,Lydia and I may have to go;
10970,I,"Patty will try to teach the rest,"
10971,I,Mama agrees it will be best.
10972,I,"Dear boy, good-bye, I am, you see,"
10973,I,Ever your dearest Emily.
10974,I,"We want to know, so write and tell,"
10975,I,If you’d a valentine as well.’
10976,I,
10977,I,
10978,II,II
10979,II,
10980,II,Five tardy years were fully spent
10981,II,Ere next my cousins’ way I went;
10982,II,With Christmas then I came to see
10983,II,My uncle in his rectory:
10984,II,But they the town had left; no more
10985,II,Were in the vicarage of yore.
10986,II,"When time his sixtieth year had brought,"
10987,II,An easier cure the vicar sought:
10988,II,A country parsonage was made
10989,II,"Sufficient, amply, with the aid"
10990,II,"Of mortar here and there, and bricks,"
10991,II,For him and wife and children six.
10992,II,"Though neighbours now, there scarce was light"
10993,II,To see them and return ere night.
10994,II,Emily wrote: how glad they were
10995,II,To hear of my arrival there;
10996,II,Mama had bid her say that all
10997,II,The house was crowded for the ball
10998,II,"Till Tuesday, but if I would come,"
10999,II,She thought that they could find me room;
11000,II,"The week with them I then should spend,"
11001,II,But really must the ball attend;
11002,II,"‘Dear cousin, you have been away"
11003,II,"For such an age, pray don’t delay,"
11004,II,But come and do not lose a day.’
11005,II,"A schoolboy still, but now, indeed,"
11006,II,"About to college to proceed,"
11007,II,"Dancing was, let it be confess’d,"
11008,II,To me no pleasure at the best:
11009,II,Of girls and of their lovely looks
11010,II,"I thought not, busy with my books."
11011,II,"Still, though a little ill-content,"
11012,II,Upon the Monday morn I went:
11013,II,"My cousins, each and all, I found"
11014,II,"Wondrously grown! They kissed me round,"
11015,II,And so affectionate and good
11016,II,"They were, it could not be withstood."
11017,II,"Emily, I was so surprised,"
11018,II,At first I hardly recognised;
11019,II,"Her face so formed and rounded now,"
11020,II,Such knowledge in her eyes and brow;
11021,II,"For all I read and thought I knew,"
11022,II,She could divine me through and through.
11023,II,"Where had she been, and what had done,"
11024,II,"I asked, such victory to have won?"
11025,II,"She had not studied, had not read,"
11026,II,"Seemed to have little in her head,"
11027,II,"Yet of herself the right and true,"
11028,II,As of her own experience knew.
11029,II,"Straight from her eyes her judgments flew,"
11030,II,"Like absolute decrees they ran,"
11031,II,"From mine, on such a different plan."
11032,II,A simple county country ball
11033,II,"It was to be, not grand at all;"
11034,II,"And cousins four with me would dance,"
11035,II,And keep me well in countenance.
11036,II,And there were people there to be
11037,II,"Who knew of old my family,"
11038,II,"Friends of my friends—I heard and knew,"
11039,II,"And tried; but no, it would not do."
11040,II,Somehow it seemed a sort of thing
11041,II,To which my strength I could not bring;
11042,II,"The music scarcely touched my ears,"
11043,II,The figures fluttered me with fears.
11044,II,"I talked, but had not aught to say,"
11045,II,"Danced, my instructions to obey;"
11046,II,E’en when with beautiful good-will
11047,II,Emilia through the long quadrille
11048,II,"Conducted me, alas the day,"
11049,II,Ten times I wished myself away.
11050,II,"But she, invested with a dower"
11051,II,"Of conscious, scarce-exerted power,"
11052,II,"Emilia, so, I know not why,"
11053,II,"They called her now, not Emily,"
11054,II,"Amid the living, heaving throng,"
11055,II,"Sedately, somewhat, moved along,"
11056,II,"Serenely, somewhat, in the dance"
11057,II,"Mingled, divining at a glance,"
11058,II,And reading every countenance;
11059,II,"Not stately she, nor grand nor tall,"
11060,II,Yet looked as if controlling all
11061,II,The fluctuations of the ball;
11062,II,"Her subjects ready at her call,"
11063,II,"All others, she a queen, her throne"
11064,II,"Preparing, and her title known,"
11065,II,Though not yet taken as her own.
11066,II,"O wonderful! I still can see,"
11067,II,And twice she came and danced with me.
11068,II,"She asked me of my school, and what"
11069,II,"Those prizes were that I had got,"
11070,II,"And what we learnt, and ‘oh,’ she said,"
11071,II,"‘How much to carry in one’s head,’"
11072,II,"And I must be upon my guard,"
11073,II,And really must not work too hard:
11074,II,Who were my friends? and did I go
11075,II,Ever to balls? I told her no:
11076,II,"She said, ‘I really like them so;"
11077,II,"But then I am a girl; and dear,"
11078,II,"You like your friends at school, I fear"
11079,II,Better than anybody here.’
11080,II,"How long had she left school, I asked."
11081,II,"Two years, she told me, and I tasked"
11082,II,My faltering speech to learn about
11083,II,"Her life, but could not bring it out:"
11084,II,This while the dancers round us flew.
11085,II,"Helston, whom formerly I knew,"
11086,II,"My schoolfellow, was at the ball,"
11087,II,"A man full-statured, fair and tall,"
11088,II,"Helston of Helston now they said,"
11089,II,"Heir to his uncle, who was dead;"
11090,II,"In the army, too: he danced with three"
11091,II,Of the four sisters. Emily
11092,II,"Refused him once, to dance with me."
11093,II,How long it seemed! and yet at one
11094,II,"We left, before ’twas nearly done:"
11095,II,How thankful I! the journey through
11096,II,I talked to them with spirits new;
11097,II,And the brief sleep of closing night
11098,II,"Brought a sensation of delight,"
11099,II,"Which, when I woke, was exquisite."
11100,II,The music moving in my brain
11101,II,I felt; in the gay crowd again
11102,II,"Half felt, half saw the girlish bands,"
11103,II,"On their white skirts their white-gloved hands,"
11104,II,"Advance, retreat, and yet advance,"
11105,II,And mingle in the mingling dance.
11106,II,"The impulse had arrived at last,"
11107,II,When the opportunity was past.
11108,II,Breakfast my soft sensations first
11109,II,With livelier passages dispersed.
11110,II,"Reposing in his country home,"
11111,II,"Which half luxurious had become,"
11112,II,"Gay was their father, loudly flung"
11113,II,"His guests and blushing girls among,"
11114,II,"His jokes; and she, their mother, too,"
11115,II,"Less anxious seemed, with less to do,"
11116,II,Her daughters aiding. As the day
11117,II,"Advanced, the others went away,"
11118,II,"But I must absolutely stay,"
11119,II,The girls cried out; I stayed and let
11120,II,"Myself be once more half their pet,"
11121,II,Although a little on the fret.
11122,II,How ill our boyhood understands
11123,II,Incipient manhood’s strong demands!
11124,II,"Boys have such troubles of their own,"
11125,II,"As none, they fancy, e’er have known,"
11126,II,"Such as to speak of, or to tell,"
11127,II,"They hold, were unendurable:"
11128,II,"Religious, social, of all kinds,"
11129,II,That tear and agitate their minds.
11130,II,"A thousand thoughts within me stirred,"
11131,II,Of which I could not speak a word;
11132,II,"Strange efforts after something new,"
11133,II,Which I was wretched not to do;
11134,II,"Passions, ambitions lay and lurked,"
11135,II,"Wants, counter-wants, obscurely worked"
11136,II,"Without their names, and unexplained."
11137,II,And where had Emily obtained
11138,II,"Assurance, and had ascertained?"
11139,II,"How strange, how far behind was I,"
11140,II,"And how it came, I asked, and why?"
11141,II,"How was it, and how could it be,"
11142,II,And what was all that worked in me?
11143,II,"They used to scold me when I read,"
11144,II,And bade me talk to them instead;
11145,II,"When I absconded to my room,"
11146,II,To fetch me out they used to come;
11147,II,"Oft by myself I went to walk,"
11148,II,"But, by degrees, was got to talk."
11149,II,"The year had cheerfully begun,"
11150,II,"With more than winter’s wonted sun,"
11151,II,"Mountains, in the green garden ways,"
11152,II,Gleamed through the laurel and the bays.
11153,II,I well remember letting out
11154,II,"One day, as there I looked about,"
11155,II,"While they of girls discoursing sat,"
11156,II,"This one how sweet, how lovely that,"
11157,II,That I could greater pleasure take
11158,II,In looking on Llynidwil lake
11159,II,Than on the fairest female face:
11160,II,They could not understand: a place!
11161,II,Incomprehensible it seemed;
11162,II,"Philippa looked as if she dreamed,"
11163,II,"Patty and Lydia loud exclaimed,"
11164,II,"And I already was ashamed,"
11165,II,"When Emily asked, half apart,"
11166,II,If to the lake I’d given my heart;
11167,II,"And did the lake, she wished to learn,"
11168,II,My tender sentiment return.
11169,II,"For music, too, I would not care,"
11170,II,Which was an infinite despair:
11171,II,"When Lydia took her seat to play,"
11172,II,"I read a book, or walked away."
11173,II,"I was not quite composed, I own,"
11174,II,Except when with the girls alone;
11175,II,Looked to their father still with fear
11176,II,Of how to him I must appear;
11177,II,"And was entirely put to shame,"
11178,II,When once some rough he-cousins came.
11179,II,Yet Emily from all distress
11180,II,"Could reinstate me, more or less;"
11181,II,"How pleasant by her side to walk,"
11182,II,"How beautiful to let her talk,"
11183,II,"How charming; yet, by slow degrees,"
11184,II,"I got impatient, ill at ease;"
11185,II,"Half glad, half wretched, when at last"
11186,II,"The visit ended, and ’twas past."
11187,II,
11188,II,
11189,III,III
11190,III,
11191,III,"Next year I went and spent a week,"
11192,III,And certainly had learnt to speak;
11193,III,"My chains I forcibly had broke,"
11194,III,And now too much indeed I spoke.
11195,III,A mother sick and seldom seen
11196,III,"A grief for many months had been,"
11197,III,"Their father too was feebler, years"
11198,III,"Were heavy, and there had been fears"
11199,III,Some months ago; and he was vexed
11200,III,With party heats and all perplexed
11201,III,With an upheaving modern change
11202,III,To him and his old wisdom strange.
11203,III,"The daughters all were there, not one"
11204,III,"Had yet to other duties run,"
11205,III,"Their father, people used to say,"
11206,III,Frightened the wooers all away;—
11207,III,"As vines around an ancient stem,"
11208,III,"They clung and clustered upon him,"
11209,III,"Him loved and tended; above all,"
11210,III,"Emilia, ever at his call."
11211,III,But I was—intellectual;
11212,III,I talked in high superior tone
11213,III,"Of things the girls had never known,"
11214,III,Far wiser to have let alone;
11215,III,Things which the father knew in short
11216,III,By country clerical report;
11217,III,"I talked of much I thought I knew,"
11218,III,"Used all my college wit anew,"
11219,III,A little on my fancy drew;
11220,III,"Religion, politics, O me!"
11221,III,No subject great enough could be.
11222,III,"In vain, more weak in spirit grown,"
11223,III,At times he tried to put me down.
11224,III,"I own it was the want, in part,"
11225,III,Of any discipline of heart.
11226,III,"It was, now hard at work again,"
11227,III,The busy argufying brain
11228,III,"Of the prize schoolboy; but, indeed,"
11229,III,"Much more, if right the thing I read,"
11230,III,It was the instinctive wish to try
11231,III,"And, above all things, not be shy."
11232,III,Alas! it did not do at all;
11233,III,"Ill went the visit, ill the ball;"
11234,III,"Each hour I felt myself grow worse,"
11235,III,With every effort more perverse.
11236,III,"I tried to change; too hard, indeed,"
11237,III,"I tried, and never could succeed."
11238,III,Out of sheer spite an extra day
11239,III,"I stayed; but when I went away,"
11240,III,"Alas, the farewells were not warm,"
11241,III,The kissing was the merest form;
11242,III,"Emilia was _distraite_ and sad,"
11243,III,And everything was bad as bad.
11244,III,
11245,III,"O had some happy chance fall’n out,"
11246,III,"To turn the thing just round about,"
11247,III,In time at least to give anew
11248,III,The old affectionate adieu!
11249,III,"A little thing, a word, a jest,"
11250,III,"A laugh, had set us all at rest;"
11251,III,"But nothing came. I went away,"
11252,III,"And could have really cried that day,"
11253,III,"So vexed, for I had meant so well,"
11254,III,"Yet everything so ill befell,"
11255,III,And why and how I could not tell.
11256,III,
11257,III,"Our wounds in youth soon close and heal,"
11258,III,"Or seem to close; young people feel,"
11259,III,"And suffer greatly, I believe,"
11260,III,But then they can’t profess to grieve:
11261,III,"Their pleasures occupy them more,"
11262,III,And they have so much time before.
11263,III,At twenty life appeared to me
11264,III,A sort of vague infinity;
11265,III,"And though of changes still I heard,"
11266,III,Real changes had not yet occurred:
11267,III,"And all things were, or would be, well,"
11268,III,And nothing irremediable.
11269,III,The youth for his degree that reads
11270,III,Beyond it nothing knows or needs;
11271,III,Nor till ’tis over wakes to see
11272,III,The busy world’s reality.
11273,III,
11274,III,One visit brief I made again
11275,III,"In autumn next but one, and then"
11276,III,All better found. With Mary Gwen
11277,III,"I talked, a schoolgirl just about"
11278,III,To leave this winter and come out.
11279,III,"Patty and Lydia were away,"
11280,III,And a strange sort of distance lay
11281,III,Betwixt me and Emilia.
11282,III,"She sought me less, and I was shy."
11283,III,And yet this time I think that I
11284,III,"More subtly felt, more saw, more knew"
11285,III,The beauty into which she grew;
11286,III,More understood the meanings now
11287,III,"Of the still eyes and rounded brow,"
11288,III,"And could, perhaps, have told you how"
11289,III,The intellect that crowns our race
11290,III,To more than beauty in her face
11291,III,Was changed. But I confuse from hence
11292,III,The later and the earlier sense.
11293,III,
11294,III,
11295,IV,IV
11296,IV,
11297,IV,Have you the Giesbach seen? a fall
11298,IV,"In Switzerland you say, that’s all;"
11299,IV,"That, and an inn, from which proceeds"
11300,IV,"A path that to the Faulhorn leads,"
11301,IV,From whence you see the world of snows.
11302,IV,"Few see how perfect in repose,"
11303,IV,"White green, the lake lies deeply set,"
11304,IV,"Where, slowly purifying yet,"
11305,IV,The icy river-floods retain
11306,IV,A something of the glacier stain.
11307,IV,"Steep cliffs arise the waters o’er,"
11308,IV,"The Giesbach leads you to a shore,"
11309,IV,And to one still sequestered bay
11310,IV,I found elsewhere a scrambling way.
11311,IV,"Above, the loftier heights ascend,"
11312,IV,And level platforms here extend
11313,IV,"The mountains and the cliffs between,"
11314,IV,"With firs and grassy spaces green,"
11315,IV,And little dips and knolls to show
11316,IV,In part or whole the lake below;
11317,IV,And all exactly at the height
11318,IV,To make the pictures exquisite.
11319,IV,"Most exquisite they seemed to me,"
11320,IV,"When, a year after my degree,"
11321,IV,Passing upon my journey home
11322,IV,"From Greece, and Sicily, and Rome,"
11323,IV,I stayed at that minute hotel
11324,IV,"Six days, or eight, I cannot tell."
11325,IV,Twelve months had led me fairly through
11326,IV,The old world surviving in the new.
11327,IV,"From Rome with joy I passed to Greece,"
11328,IV,To Athens and the Peloponnese;
11329,IV,Saluted with supreme delight
11330,IV,The Parthenon-surmounted height;
11331,IV,"In huts at Delphi made abode,"
11332,IV,And in Arcadian valleys rode;
11333,IV,Counted the towns that lie like slain
11334,IV,Upon the wide Bœotian plain;
11335,IV,With wonder in the spacious gloom
11336,IV,Stood of the Mycenæan tomb;
11337,IV,From the Acrocorinth watched the day
11338,IV,Light the eastern and the western bay.
11339,IV,"Constantinople then had seen,"
11340,IV,"Where, by her cypresses, the queen"
11341,IV,Of the East sees flow through portals wide
11342,IV,The steady streaming Scythian tide;
11343,IV,"And after, from Scamander’s mouth,"
11344,IV,"Went up to Troy, and to the South,"
11345,IV,"To Lycia, Caria, pressed, atwhiles"
11346,IV,Outvoyaging to Egean isles.
11347,IV,"To see the things, which, sick with doubt"
11348,IV,"And comment, one had learnt about,"
11349,IV,"Was like clear morning after night,"
11350,IV,Or raising of the blind to sight.
11351,IV,"Aware it might be first and last,"
11352,IV,"I did it eagerly and fast,"
11353,IV,And took unsparingly my fill.
11354,IV,The impetus of travel still
11355,IV,"Urged me, but laden, half oppress’d,"
11356,IV,"Here lighting on a place of rest,"
11357,IV,"I yielded, asked not if ’twere best."
11358,IV,"Pleasant it was, reposing here,"
11359,IV,"To sum the experience of the year,"
11360,IV,And let the accumulated gain
11361,IV,Assort itself upon the brain.
11362,IV,"Travel’s a miniature life,"
11363,IV,"Travel is evermore a strife,"
11364,IV,Where he must run who would obtain.
11365,IV,’Tis a perpetual loss and gain;
11366,IV,"For sloth and error dear we pay,"
11367,IV,"By luck and effort win our way,"
11368,IV,And both have need of every day.
11369,IV,"Each day has got its sight to see,"
11370,IV,Each day must put to profit be;
11371,IV,"Pleasant, when seen are all the sights,"
11372,IV,To let them think themselves to rights.
11373,IV,"I on the Giesbach turf reclined,"
11374,IV,"Half watched this process in my mind,"
11375,IV,"Watch the stream purifying slow,"
11376,IV,In me and in the lake below;
11377,IV,"And then began to think of home,"
11378,IV,And possibilities to come.
11379,IV,
11380,IV,"Brienz, on our Brienzer See"
11381,IV,From Interlaken every day
11382,IV,"A steamer seeks, and at our pier"
11383,IV,Lets out a crowd to see things here;
11384,IV,Up a steep path they pant and strive;
11385,IV,"When to the level they arrive,"
11386,IV,"Dispersing, hither, thither, run,"
11387,IV,"For all must rapidly be done,"
11388,IV,"And seek, with questioning and din,"
11389,IV,"Some the cascade, and some the inn,"
11390,IV,"The waterfall, for if you look,"
11391,IV,You find it printed in the book
11392,IV,"That man or woman, so inclined,"
11393,IV,May pass the very fall behind;
11394,IV,So many feet there intervene
11395,IV,The rock and flying jet between;
11396,IV,"The inn, ’tis also in the plan"
11397,IV,"(For tourist is a hungry man),"
11398,IV,"And a small _salle_ repeats by rote,"
11399,IV,"A daily task of _table d’hôte_,"
11400,IV,"Where broth and meat, and country wine"
11401,IV,Assure the strangers that they dine;
11402,IV,"Do it they must while they have power,"
11403,IV,For in three-quarters of an hour
11404,IV,"Back comes the steamer from Brienz,"
11405,IV,And with one clear departure hence
11406,IV,The quietude is more intense.
11407,IV,It was my custom at the top
11408,IV,"To stand and see them clambering up,"
11409,IV,"Then take advantage of the start,"
11410,IV,And pass into the woods apart.
11411,IV,"It happened, and I know not why,"
11412,IV,I once returned too speedily;
11413,IV,"And, seeing women still and men,"
11414,IV,"Was swerving to the woods again,"
11415,IV,But for a moment stopped to seize
11416,IV,A glance at some one near the trees;
11417,IV,"A figure full, but full of grace,"
11418,IV,Its movement beautified the place.
11419,IV,"It turns, advances, comes my way;"
11420,IV,"What do I see, what do I say?"
11421,IV,"Yet, to a statelier beauty grown,"
11422,IV,"It is, it can be, she alone!"
11423,IV,O mountains round! O heaven above!
11424,IV,"It is—Emilia, whom I love;"
11425,IV,"‘Emilia, whom I love,’ the word"
11426,IV,"Rose to my lips, as yet unheard,"
11427,IV,"When she, whose colour flushed to red,"
11428,IV,"In a soft voice, ‘My husband,’ said;"
11429,IV,"And Helston came up with his hand,"
11430,IV,And both of them took mine; but stand
11431,IV,"And talk they could not, they must go;"
11432,IV,The steamer rang her bell below;
11433,IV,How curious that I did not know!
11434,IV,"They were to go and stay at Thun,"
11435,IV,Could I come there and see them soon?
11436,IV,"And shortly were returning home,"
11437,IV,And when would I to Helston come?
11438,IV,"Thus down we went, I put them in;"
11439,IV,"Off went the steamer with a din,"
11440,IV,And on the pier I stood and eyed
11441,IV,"The bridegroom, seated by the bride,"
11442,IV,Emilia closing to his side.
11443,IV,
11444,IV,
11445,V,V
11446,V,
11447,V,She wrote from Helston; begged I’d come
11448,V,And see her in her husband’s home.
11449,V,"I went, and bound by double vow,"
11450,V,"Not only wife, but mother now,"
11451,V,"I found her, lovely as of old,"
11452,V,"O, rather, lovelier manifold."
11453,V,"Her wifely sweet reserve unbroke,"
11454,V,"Still frankly, tenderly, she spoke;"
11455,V,"Asked me about myself, would hear"
11456,V,What I proposed to do this year;
11457,V,"At college why was I detained,"
11458,V,Was it the fellowship I’d gained?
11459,V,I told her that I was not tied
11460,V,"Henceforward further to reside,"
11461,V,"Yet very likely might stay on,"
11462,V,And lapse into a college don;
11463,V,My fellowship itself would give
11464,V,"A competence on which to live,"
11465,V,"And if I waited, who could tell,"
11466,V,"I might be tutor too, as well."
11467,V,"Oh, but, she said, I must not stay,"
11468,V,College and school were only play;
11469,V,"I might be sick, perhaps, of praise,"
11470,V,But must not therefore waste my days!
11471,V,"Fellows grow indolent, and then"
11472,V,"They may not do as other men,"
11473,V,"And for your happiness in life,"
11474,V,Sometime you’ll wish to have a wife.
11475,V,
11476,V,"Languidly by her chair I sat,"
11477,V,But my eyes rather flashed at that.
11478,V,"I said, ‘Emilia, people change,"
11479,V,"But yet, I own, I find it strange"
11480,V,To hear this common talk from you:
11481,V,"You speak, and some believe it true,"
11482,V,Just as if any wife would do;
11483,V,"Whoe’er one takes, ’tis much the same,"
11484,V,"And love—and so forth, but a name.’"
11485,V,She coloured. ‘What can I have said
11486,V,Or what could put it in your head?
11487,V,"Indeed, I had not in my mind"
11488,V,The faintest notion of the kind.’
11489,V,I told her that I did not know—
11490,V,Her tone appeared to mean it so.
11491,V,"‘Emilia, when I’ve heard,’ I said,"
11492,V,"‘How people match themselves and wed,"
11493,V,"I’ve sometimes wished that both were dead,’"
11494,V,
11495,V,She turned a little pale. I woke
11496,V,Some thought; what thought I but soft she spoke;
11497,V,"‘I’m sure that what you meant was good,"
11498,V,"But, really, you misunderstood."
11499,V,"From point to point so quick you fly,"
11500,V,"And are so vehement,—and I,"
11501,V,"As you remember, long ago,"
11502,V,"Am stupid, certainly am slow."
11503,V,And yet some things I seem to know;
11504,V,"I know it will be just a crime,"
11505,V,If you should waste your powers and time.
11506,V,"There is so much, I think, that you,"
11507,V,"And no one equally, can do.’"
11508,V,"‘It does not matter much,’ said I,"
11509,V,‘The things I thought of are gone by;
11510,V,I’m quite content to wait to die.’
11511,V,
11512,V,A sort of beauteous anger spread
11513,V,"Over her face. ‘O me!’ she said,"
11514,V,"‘That you should sit and trifle so,"
11515,V,And you so utterly don’t know
11516,V,"How greatly you have yet to grow,"
11517,V,"How wide your objects have to expand,"
11518,V,How much is yet an unknown land!
11519,V,"You’re twenty-three, I’m twenty-five,"
11520,V,And I am so much more alive.’
11521,V,"My eyes I shaded with my hand,"
11522,V,And almost lost my self-command.
11523,V,"I muttered something: ‘Yes, I see;"
11524,V,Two years have severed you from me.
11525,V,"O, Emily, was it ever told,’"
11526,V,"I asked, ‘that souls are young and old?’"
11527,V,"But she, continuing, ‘All the day"
11528,V,"Were I to speak, I could but say"
11529,V,The one same thing the one same way.
11530,V,"Sometimes, indeed, I think, you know,’"
11531,V,"And her tone suddenly was low,"
11532,V,"‘That in a day we yet shall see,"
11533,V,"You of my sisters and of me,"
11534,V,"And of the things that used to be,"
11535,V,"Will think, as you look back again,"
11536,V,With something not unlike disdain;
11537,V,"So you your rightful place obtain,"
11538,V,"That will to me be joy, not pain.’"
11539,V,"Her voice still lower, lower fell,"
11540,V,"I heard, just heard, each syllable."
11541,V,"‘But,’ in the tone she used before,"
11542,V,‘Don’t stay at college any more!
11543,V,"For others it perhaps may do,"
11544,V,I’m sure it will be bad for you.’
11545,V,
11546,V,She softened me. The following day
11547,V,We parted. As I went away
11548,V,"Her infant on her bosom lay,"
11549,V,"And, as a mother might her boy,"
11550,V,I think she would with loving joy
11551,V,"Have kissed me; but I turned to go,"
11552,V,’Twas better not to have it so.
11553,V,"Next year achieved me some amends,"
11554,V,"And once we met, and met as friends."
11555,V,"Friends, yet apart; I had not much"
11556,V,"Valued her judgment, though to touch"
11557,V,"Her words had power; yet, strangely still,"
11558,V,It had been cogent on my will.
11559,V,"As she had counselled, I had done,"
11560,V,And a new effort was begun.
11561,V,"Forth to the war of life I went,"
11562,V,"Courageous, and not ill content."
11563,V,
11564,V,‘Yours is the fault I opened thus again
11565,V,"A youthful, ancient, sentimental vein,’"
11566,V,"He said, ‘and like Munchausen’s horn o’erflow"
11567,V,With liquefying tunes of long ago.
11568,V,"My wiser friend, who knows for what we live,"
11569,V,"And what shall seek, will his correction give.’"
11570,V,
11571,V,"We all made thanks. ‘My tale were quickly told,’"
11572,V,"The other said, ‘but the turned heavens behold;"
11573,V,"The night two watches of the night is old,"
11574,V,The sinking stars their suasions urge for sleep.
11575,V,My story for to-morrow night will keep.’
11576,V,
11577,V,"The evening after, when the day was stilled,"
11578,V,His promise thus the clergyman fulfilled.

11603,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Vexed with himself, and shamed, he felt the more"
11604,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,A kind of joy he ne’er had felt before.
11605,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Something there was that from this date began;
11606,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,’Twas beautiful with her to be a man.

11627,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"That from the obvious good still led astray,"

11670,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘Or are there modes of love, and different kinds,"
11671,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Proportioned to the sizes of our minds?
11672,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"There are who say thus, I held there was one,"
11673,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"One love, one deity, one central sun;"
11674,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"As he resistless brings the expanding day,"
11675,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,So love should come on his victorious way.
11676,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"If light at all, can light indeed be there,"

11682,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Tenant at will of so much of the soul,"
11683,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Not lord and mighty master of the whole?
11684,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"There are who say, and say that it is well;"

11686,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘Montaigne, I know in a realm high above"

11688,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,’Tis not in love that we should think to find
11689,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,The lofty fellowship of mind with mind;
11690,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Love’s not a joy where soul and soul unite,"
11691,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Rather a wondrous animal delight;
11692,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"And as in spring, for one consummate hour"
11693,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"The world of vegetation turns to flower,"
11694,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"The birds with liveliest plumage trim their wing,"

11696,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"When spring is o’er and summer days are sped,"
11697,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"The songs are silent, and the blossoms dead:"
11698,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,E’en so of man and woman is the bliss.
11699,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"O, but I will not tamely yield to this!"
11700,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"I think it only shows us in the end,"
11701,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Montaigne was happy in a noble friend,"
11702,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Had not the fortune of a noble wife;
11703,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"He lived, I think, a poor ignoble life,"
11704,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"And wrote of petty pleasures, petty pain;"
11705,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,I do not greatly think about Montaigne.’
11706,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘How charming to be with her! yet indeed,"
11707,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,After a while I find a blank succeed;
11708,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"After a while she little has to say,"
11709,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"I’m silent too, although I wish to stay;"
11710,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"What would it be all day, day after day?"
11711,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Ah! but I ask, I do not doubt, too much;"
11712,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,I think of love as if it should be such
11713,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,As to fulfil and occupy in whole
11714,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"The nought-else-seeking, nought-essaying soul."
11715,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Therefore it is my mind with doubts I urge;
11716,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Hence are these fears and shiverings on the verge;
11717,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"By books, not nature, thus have we been schooled,"
11718,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,By poetry and novels been befooled;
11719,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Wiser tradition says, the affections’ claim"
11720,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Will be supplied, the rest will be the same."
11721,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"I think too much of love, ’tis true: I know"
11722,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"It is not all, was ne’er intended so;"
11723,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Yet such a change, so entire, I feel, ’twould be,"
11724,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"So potent, so omnipotent with me;"
11725,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"My former self I never should recall,—"
11726,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Indeed I think it must be all in all.’
11727,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘I thought that Love was winged; without a sound,"
11728,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"His purple pinions bore him o’er the ground,"
11729,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Wafted without an effort here or there,"
11730,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,He came—and we too trod as if in air:—
11731,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"But panting, toiling, clambering up the hill,"
11732,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Am I to assist him? I, put forth my will"
11733,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"To upbear his lagging footsteps, lame and slow,"
11734,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"And help him on and tell him where to go,"
11735,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,And ease him of his quiver and his bow?’
11736,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,‘Erotion! I saw it in a book;
11737,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Why did I notice it, why did I look?"
11738,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Yea, is it so, ye powers that see above?"
11739,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"I do not love, I want, I try to love!"
11740,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"This is not love, but lack of love instead!"
11741,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Merciless thought! I would I had been dead,"
11742,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Or e’er the phrase had come into my head.’
11743,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"She also wrote: and here may find a place,"
11744,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Of her and of her thoughts some slender trace.
11745,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘He is not vain; if proud, he quells his pride,"
11746,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,And somehow really likes to be defied;
11747,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Rejoices if you humble him: indeed
11748,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Gives way at once, and leaves you to succeed.’"
11749,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘Easy it were with such a mind to play,"
11750,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"And foolish not to do so, some would say;"
11751,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,One almost smiles to look and see the way:
11752,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"But come what will, I will not play a part,"
11753,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Indeed I dare not condescend to art.’
11754,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘Easy ’twere not, perhaps, with him to live;"
11755,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,He looks for more than any one can give:
11756,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,So dulled at times and disappointed; still
11757,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Expecting what depends not of my will:
11758,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"My inspiration comes not at my call,"
11759,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Seek me as I am, if seek you do at all.’"
11760,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘Like him I do, and think of him I must;"
11761,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,But more—I dare not and I cannot trust.
11762,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"This more he brings—say, is it more or less"
11763,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Than that no fruitage ever came to bless,—"
11764,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,The old wild flower of love-in-idleness?’
11765,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘Me when he leaves and others when he sees,"
11766,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,What is my fate who am not there to please?
11767,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Me he has left; already may have seen
11768,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"One, who for me forgotten here has been;"
11769,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"And he, the while is balancing between."
11770,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"If the heart spoke, the heart I knew were bound;"
11771,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,What if it utter an uncertain sound?’
11772,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘So quick to vary, so rejoiced to change,"
11773,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,From this to that his feelings surely range;
11774,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"His fancies wander, and his thoughts as well;"
11775,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"And if the heart be constant, who can tell?"
11776,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Far off to fly, to abandon me, and go,"
11777,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,He seems returning then before I know:
11778,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"With every accident he seems to move,"
11779,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Is now below me and is now above,"
11780,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Now far aside,—O, does he really love?’"
11781,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,‘Absence were hard; yet let the trial be;
11782,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"His nature’s aim and purpose he would free,"
11783,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,And in the world his course of action see.
11784,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"O should he lose, not learn; pervert his scope;"
11785,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,O should I lose! and yet to win I hope.
11786,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"I win not now; his way if now I went,"
11787,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Brief joy I gave, for years of discontent.’"
11788,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘Gone, is it true? but oft he went before,"
11789,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,And came again before a month was o’er.
11790,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Gone—though I could not venture upon art,"
11791,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,It was perhaps a foolish pride in part;
11792,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"He had such ready fancies in his head,"
11793,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,And really was so easy to be led;
11794,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"One might have failed; and yet I feel ’twas pride,"
11795,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,And can’t but half repent I never tried.
11796,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Gone, is it true? but he again will come,"
11797,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Wandering he loves, and loves returning home.’"
11798,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Gone, it was true; nor came so soon again;"
11799,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Came, after travelling, pleasure half, half pain,"
11800,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Came, but a half of Europe first o’erran;"
11801,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Arrived, his father found a ruined man."
11802,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Rich they had been, and rich was Emma too."
11803,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Heiress of wealth she knew not, Edmund knew."
11804,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Farewell to her!—In a new home obscure,"
11805,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Food for his helpless parents to secure,"
11806,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"From early morning to advancing dark,"
11807,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,He toiled and laboured as a merchant’s clerk.
11808,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Three years his heavy load he bore, nor quailed,"
11809,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Then all his health, though scarce his spirit, failed;"
11810,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Friends interposed, insisted it must be,"
11811,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Enforced their help, and sent him to the sea."
11812,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Wandering about with little here to do,"
11813,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"His old thoughts mingling dimly with his new,"
11814,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Wandering one morn, he met upon the shore,"
11815,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Her, whom he quitted five long years before."
11816,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Alas! why quitted? Say that charms are nought,"
11817,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Nor grace, nor beauty worth one serious thought;"
11818,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Was there no mystic virtue in the sense
11819,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,That joined your boyish girlish innocence?
11820,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Is constancy a thing to throw away,"
11821,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,And loving faithfulness a chance of every day?
11822,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Alas! why quitted? is she changed? but now
11823,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,The weight of intellect is in her brow;
11824,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Changed, or but truer seen, one sees in her"
11825,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Something to wake the soul, the interior sense to stir."
11826,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Alone they met, from alien eyes away,"
11827,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,The high shore hid them in a tiny bay.
11828,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Alone was he, was she; in sweet surprise"
11829,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"They met, before they knew it, in their eyes."
11830,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"In his a wondering admiration glowed,"
11831,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"In hers, a world of tenderness o’erflowed;"
11832,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"In a brief moment all was known and seen,"
11833,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,That of slow years the wearying work had been:
11834,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Morn’s early odorous breath perchance in sooth,"
11835,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Awoke the old natural feeling of their youth:
11836,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"The sea, perchance, and solitude had charms,"
11837,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,They met—I know not—in each other’s arms.
11838,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Why linger now—why waste the sands of life?
11839,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"A few sweet weeks, and they were man and wife."
11840,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"To his old frailty do not be severe,"
11841,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,His latest theory with patience hear:
11842,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘I sought not, truly would to seek disdain,"
11843,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"A kind, soft pillow for a wearying pain,"
11844,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Fatigues and cares to lighten, to relieve;"
11845,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"But love is fellow-service, I believe.’"
11846,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘No, truly no, it was not to obtain,"
11847,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Though that alone were happiness, were gain,"
11848,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"A tender breast to fall upon and weep,"
11849,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"A heart, the secrets of my heart to keep;"
11850,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"To share my hopes, and in my griefs to grieve;"
11851,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"Yet love is fellow-service, I believe.’"

11861,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"The tale, we said, instructive was, but short;"
11862,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,Could he not give another of the sort?
11863,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"He feared his second might his first repeat,"
11864,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"‘And Aristotle teaches, change is sweet;"
11865,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"But come, our younger friend in this dim night"

11867,_THE CLERGYMAN’S FIRST TALE._,"I said I’d had but little time to live,"

11877,_MY TALE._,"_A la Banquette, or a Modern Pilgrimage._"
11878,_MY TALE._,
11879,_MY TALE._,"I stayed at La Quenille, ten miles or more"
11880,_MY TALE._,From the old-Roman sources of Mont Dore;
11881,_MY TALE._,"Travellers to Tulle this way are forced to go,"
11882,_MY TALE._,"—An old high-road from Lyons to Bordeaux,—"
11883,_MY TALE._,"From Tulle to Brives the swift Corrèze descends,"
11884,_MY TALE._,"At Brives you’ve railway, and your trouble ends;"
11885,_MY TALE._,A little _bourg_ La Quenille; from the height
11886,_MY TALE._,The mountains of Auvergne are all in sight;
11887,_MY TALE._,"Green pastoral heights that once in lava flowed,"
11888,_MY TALE._,Of primal fire the product and abode;
11889,_MY TALE._,And all the plateaux and the lines that trace
11890,_MY TALE._,Where in deep dells the waters find their place;
11891,_MY TALE._,"Far to the south above the lofty plain,"
11892,_MY TALE._,The Plomb du Cantal lifts his towering train.
11893,_MY TALE._,"A little after one, with little fail,"
11894,_MY TALE._,Down drove the diligence that bears the mail;
11895,_MY TALE._,"The _courier_ therefore called, in whose _banquette_"
11896,_MY TALE._,"A place I got, and thankful was to get;"
11897,_MY TALE._,"The new postillion climbed his seat, _allez_,"
11898,_MY TALE._,Off broke the four cart-horses on their way.
11899,_MY TALE._,"Westward we roll, o’er heathy backs of hills,"
11900,_MY TALE._,Crossing the future rivers in the rills;
11901,_MY TALE._,"Bare table-lands are these, and sparsely sown,"
11902,_MY TALE._,Turning their waters south to the Dordogne.
11903,_MY TALE._,"Close-packed we were, and little at our ease,"
11904,_MY TALE._,The _conducteur_ impatient with the squeeze;
11905,_MY TALE._,"Not tall he seemed, but bulky round about,"
11906,_MY TALE._,His cap and jacket made him look more stout;
11907,_MY TALE._,In _grande tenue_ he rode of _conducteur_;
11908,_MY TALE._,"Black eyes he had, black his moustaches were,"
11909,_MY TALE._,"Shaven his chin, his hair and whiskers cropt;"
11910,_MY TALE._,"A ready man; at Ussel when we stopt,"
11911,_MY TALE._,"For me and for himself, bread, meat, and wine,"
11912,_MY TALE._,"He got, the _courier_ did not wait to dine;"
11913,_MY TALE._,"To appease our hunger, and allay our drouth,"
11914,_MY TALE._,We ate and took the bottle at the mouth;
11915,_MY TALE._,"One draught I had, the rest entire had he,"
11916,_MY TALE._,For wine his body had capacity.
11917,_MY TALE._,"A peasant in his country blouse was there,"
11918,_MY TALE._,He told me of the _conseil_ and the _maire_.
11919,_MY TALE._,"Their _maire_, he said, could neither write nor read,"
11920,_MY TALE._,"And yet could keep the registers, indeed;"
11921,_MY TALE._,The _conseil_ had resigned—I know not what.—
11922,_MY TALE._,Good actions here are easily forgot:
11923,_MY TALE._,"He in the _quarante-huit_ had something done,"
11924,_MY TALE._,"Were things but fair, some notice should have won."
11925,_MY TALE._,"Another youth there was, a soldier he,"
11926,_MY TALE._,A soldier ceasing with to-day to be;
11927,_MY TALE._,"Three years had served, for three had bought release:"
11928,_MY TALE._,"From war returning to the arts of peace,"
11929,_MY TALE._,"To Tulle he went, as his department’s town,"
11930,_MY TALE._,To-morrow morn to pay his money down.
11931,_MY TALE._,"In Italy, his second year begun,"
11932,_MY TALE._,"This youth had served, when Italy was won."
11933,_MY TALE._,"He told of Montebello, and the fight,"
11934,_MY TALE._,That ended fiercely with the close of night.
11935,_MY TALE._,"There was he wounded, fell, and thought to die,"
11936,_MY TALE._,Two Austrian cones had passed into his thigh;
11937,_MY TALE._,"One traversed it, the other, left behind,"
11938,_MY TALE._,In hospital the doctor had to find:
11939,_MY TALE._,"At eight of night he fell, and sadly lay"
11940,_MY TALE._,"Till three of morning of the following day,"
11941,_MY TALE._,"When peasants came and put him on a wain,"
11942,_MY TALE._,And drove him to Voghera in his pain;
11943,_MY TALE._,"To Alessandria thence the railway bore,"
11944,_MY TALE._,In Alessandria then two months and more
11945,_MY TALE._,He lay in hospital; to lop the limb
11946,_MY TALE._,The Italian doctor who attended him
11947,_MY TALE._,"Was much disposed, but high above the knee;"
11948,_MY TALE._,For life an utter cripple he would be.
11949,_MY TALE._,"Then came the typhoid fever, and the lack"
11950,_MY TALE._,"Of food. And sick and hungering, on his back,"
11951,_MY TALE._,"With French, Italians, Austrians as he lay,"
11952,_MY TALE._,"Arrived the tidings of Magenta’s day,"
11953,_MY TALE._,"And Milan entered in the burning June,"
11954,_MY TALE._,And Solferino’s issue following soon.
11955,_MY TALE._,"Alas, the glorious wars! and shortly he"
11956,_MY TALE._,"To Genoa for the advantage of the sea,"
11957,_MY TALE._,"And to Savona, suffering still, was sent"
11958,_MY TALE._,And joined his now returning regiment.
11959,_MY TALE._,"Good were the Austrian soldiers, but the feel"
11960,_MY TALE._,"They did not well encounter of cold steel,"
11961,_MY TALE._,Nor in the bayonet fence of man with man
11962,_MY TALE._,"Maintained their ground, but yielded, turned and ran"
11963,_MY TALE._,_Les armes blanches_ and the rifled gun
11964,_MY TALE._,"Had fought the battles, and the victories won."
11965,_MY TALE._,"The glorious wars! but he, the doubtful chance"
11966,_MY TALE._,"Of soldiers’ glory quitting and advance,—"
11967,_MY TALE._,"His wounded limb less injured than he feared,—"
11968,_MY TALE._,"Was dealing now in timber, it appeared;"
11969,_MY TALE._,"Oak-timber finding for some mines of lead,"
11970,_MY TALE._,"Worked by an English company, he said."
11971,_MY TALE._,This youth perhaps was twenty-three years old;
11972,_MY TALE._,Simply and well his history he told.
11973,_MY TALE._,They wished to hear about myself as well;
11974,_MY TALE._,"I told them, but it was not much to tell;"
11975,_MY TALE._,"At the Mont Dore, of which the guide-book talks,"
11976,_MY TALE._,"I’d taken, not the waters, but the walks."
11977,_MY TALE._,"Friends I had met, who on their southward way"
11978,_MY TALE._,"Had gone before, I followed them to-day."
11979,_MY TALE._,"They wondered greatly at this wondrous thing,—"
11980,_MY TALE._,"_Les Anglais_ are for ever on the wing,—"
11981,_MY TALE._,The _conducteur_ said everybody knew
11982,_MY TALE._,We were descended of the Wandering Jew.
11983,_MY TALE._,"And on with the declining sun we rolled,"
11984,_MY TALE._,And woods and vales and fuller streams behold.
11985,_MY TALE._,"About the hour when peasant people sup,"
11986,_MY TALE._,"We dropped the peasant, took a _curé_ up,"
11987,_MY TALE._,In hat and bands and _soutane_ all to fit.
11988,_MY TALE._,He next the _conducteur_ was put to sit;
11989,_MY TALE._,I in the corner gained the senior place.
11990,_MY TALE._,"Brown was his hair, but closely shaved his face;"
11991,_MY TALE._,To lift his eyelids did he think it sin?
11992,_MY TALE._,I saw a pair of soft brown eyes within.
11993,_MY TALE._,"Older he was, but looked like twenty-two,"
11994,_MY TALE._,"Fresh from the cases, to the country new."
11995,_MY TALE._,"I, the _conducteur_ watching from my side,"
11996,_MY TALE._,A roguish twinkle in his eye espied;
11997,_MY TALE._,He begged to hear about the pretty pair
11998,_MY TALE._,Whom he supposed he had been marrying there;
11999,_MY TALE._,"The deed, he hoped, was comfortably done,—"
12000,_MY TALE._,_Monsieur l’Evêque_ he called him in his fun.
12001,_MY TALE._,Then lifted soon his voice for all to hear;
12002,_MY TALE._,A barytone he had both strong and clear:
12003,_MY TALE._,"In fragments first of music made essay,"
12004,_MY TALE._,And tried his pipes and modest felt his way.
12005,_MY TALE._,"_Le verre en main la mort nous trouvera_,"
12006,_MY TALE._,"It was, or _Ah, vous dirai-je, maman_!"
12007,_MY TALE._,"And then, _A toi, ma belle, à toi toujours_;"
12008,_MY TALE._,"Till of his organ’s quality secure,"
12009,_MY TALE._,"Trifling no more, but boldly, like a man,"
12010,_MY TALE._,He filled his chest and gallantly began.
12011,_MY TALE._,
12012,_MY TALE._,"‘Though I have seemed, against my wiser will,"
12013,_MY TALE._,"Your victim, O ye tender foibles, still,"
12014,_MY TALE._,"Once now for all, though half my heart be yours,"
12015,_MY TALE._,"Adieu, sweet faults, adieu, ye gay amours!"
12016,_MY TALE._,"Sad if it be, yet true it is to say,"
12017,_MY TALE._,"I’ve fifty years, and ’tis too late a day,"
12018,_MY TALE._,My limbs are shrinking and my hair turns grey;
12019,_MY TALE._,"Adieu, gay loves, it is too late a day!"
12020,_MY TALE._,"‘Once in your school (what good, alas! is once?)"
12021,_MY TALE._,"I took my lessons, and was not the dunce."
12022,_MY TALE._,"Oh, what a pretty girl was then Juliette!"
12023,_MY TALE._,"Don’t you suppose that I remember yet,"
12024,_MY TALE._,"Though thirty years divide me from the day,"
12025,_MY TALE._,When she and I first looked each other’s way?
12026,_MY TALE._,But now! midwinter to be matched with May!
12027,_MY TALE._,"Adieu, gay loves, it is too late a day!"
12028,_MY TALE._,"‘You lovely Marguerite! I shut my eyes,"
12029,_MY TALE._,And do my very utmost to be wise;
12030,_MY TALE._,"Yet see you still; and hear, though closed my ears,"
12031,_MY TALE._,And think I’m young in spite of all my years;
12032,_MY TALE._,Shall I forget you if I go away?
12033,_MY TALE._,"To leave is painful, but absurd to stay;"
12034,_MY TALE._,I’ve fifty dreadful reasons to obey.
12035,_MY TALE._,"Adieu, gay loves, it is too late a day!’"
12036,_MY TALE._,
12037,_MY TALE._,This priest beside the lusty _conducteur_
12038,_MY TALE._,Under his beaver sat and looked demure;
12039,_MY TALE._,"Faintly he smiled the company to please,"
12040,_MY TALE._,And folded held his hands above his knees.
12041,_MY TALE._,"Then, apropos of nothing, had we heard,"
12042,_MY TALE._,"He asked, about a thing that had occurred"
12043,_MY TALE._,"At the Mont Dore a little time ago,"
12044,_MY TALE._,"A wondrous cure? and when we answered, No,"
12045,_MY TALE._,"About a little girl he told a tale,"
12046,_MY TALE._,"Who, when her medicines were of no avail,"
12047,_MY TALE._,"Was by the doctor ordered to Mont Dore,"
12048,_MY TALE._,But nothing gained and only suffered more.
12049,_MY TALE._,This little child had in her simple way
12050,_MY TALE._,"Unto the Blessed Virgin learnt to pray,"
12051,_MY TALE._,"And, as it happened, to an image there"
12052,_MY TALE._,"By the roadside one day she made her prayer,"
12053,_MY TALE._,"And of our Lady, who can hear on high,"
12054,_MY TALE._,Begged for her parents’ sake she might not die.
12055,_MY TALE._,"Our Lady of Grace, whose attribute is love,"
12056,_MY TALE._,Beheld this child and listened from above.
12057,_MY TALE._,Her parents noticed from that very day
12058,_MY TALE._,"The malady began to pass away,"
12059,_MY TALE._,"And but a fortnight after, as they tell,"
12060,_MY TALE._,"They took her home rejoicing, sound and well."
12061,_MY TALE._,"Things come, he said, to show us every hour"
12062,_MY TALE._,We are surrounded by superior power.
12063,_MY TALE._,"Little we notice, but if once we see,"
12064,_MY TALE._,The seed of faith will grow into a tree.
12065,_MY TALE._,"The _conducteur_, he wisely shook his head:"
12066,_MY TALE._,"Strange things do happen in our time, he said;"
12067,_MY TALE._,"If the _bon Dieu_ but please, no doubt indeed,"
12068,_MY TALE._,"When things are desperate, yet they will succeed."
12069,_MY TALE._,"Ask the postillion here, and he can tell"
12070,_MY TALE._,"Who cured his horse, and what of it befell."
12071,_MY TALE._,"Then the postillion, in his smock of blue,"
12072,_MY TALE._,"His pipe into his mouth’s far corner drew,"
12073,_MY TALE._,And told about a farrier and a horse;
12074,_MY TALE._,But his _Auvergnat_ grew from bad to worse;
12075,_MY TALE._,"His rank Arvernian _patois_ was so strong,"
12076,_MY TALE._,With what he said I could not go along;
12077,_MY TALE._,"And what befell and how it came to pass,"
12078,_MY TALE._,"And if it were a horse or if an ass,"
12079,_MY TALE._,"The sequence of his phrase I could not keep,"
12080,_MY TALE._,And in the middle fairly sank to sleep.
12081,_MY TALE._,"When I awoke, I heard a stream below"
12082,_MY TALE._,"And on each bank saw houses in a row,"
12083,_MY TALE._,"Corrèze the stream, the houses Tulle, they said;"
12084,_MY TALE._,Alighted here and thankful went to bed.
12085,_MY TALE._,
12086,_MY TALE._,"‘But how,’ said one, ‘about the Pyrenees?"
12087,_MY TALE._,"In Hamlet give us Hamlet, if you please;"
12088,_MY TALE._,Your friend declares you said you met with there
12089,_MY TALE._,"A peasant beauty, beauteous past compare,"
12090,_MY TALE._,"Who fed her cows the mountain peaks between,"
12091,_MY TALE._,And asked if at Velletri you had been.
12092,_MY TALE._,And was Velletri larger than was Rome?
12093,_MY TALE._,"Her soldier-brother went away from home,"
12094,_MY TALE._,"Two years ago,—to Rome it was he went,"
12095,_MY TALE._,And to Velletri was this summer sent;
12096,_MY TALE._,"He twenty-three, and she was sweet seventeen,"
12097,_MY TALE._,And fed her cows the mountain peaks between.
12098,_MY TALE._,"Lightly along a rocky path she led,"
12099,_MY TALE._,And from a grange she brought you milk and bread.
12100,_MY TALE._,"In summer here she lived, and with the snow"
12101,_MY TALE._,Went in October to the fields below;
12102,_MY TALE._,"And where you lived, she asked, and oh, they say,"
12103,_MY TALE._,That with the English we shall fight some day;
12104,_MY TALE._,"Loveliest of peasant girls that e’er was seen,"
12105,_MY TALE._,Feeding her cows the mountain peaks between.’
12106,_MY TALE._,"‘’Tis true,’ I said, ‘though to betray was mean."
12107,_MY TALE._,"My Pyrenean verses will you hear,"
12108,_MY TALE._,"Though not about that peasant girl, I fear.’"
12109,_MY TALE._,"‘Begin,’ they said, ‘the sweet bucolic song,"
12110,_MY TALE._,Though it to other maids and other cows belong.’
12111,_MY TALE._,
12112,_MY TALE._,_Currente calamo._
12113,_MY TALE._,
12114,_MY TALE._,"Quick, painter, quick, the moment seize"
12115,_MY TALE._,Amid the snowy Pyrenees;
12116,_MY TALE._,"More evanescent than the snow,"
12117,_MY TALE._,"The pictures come, are seen, and go:"
12118,_MY TALE._,"Quick, quick, _currente calamo_."
12119,_MY TALE._,I do not ask the tints that fill
12120,_MY TALE._,The gate of day ’twixt hill and hill;
12121,_MY TALE._,I ask not for the hues that fleet
12122,_MY TALE._,Above the distant peaks; my feet
12123,_MY TALE._,"Are on a poplar-bordered road,"
12124,_MY TALE._,Where with a saddle and a load
12125,_MY TALE._,"A donkey, old and ashen-grey,"
12126,_MY TALE._,Reluctant works his dusty way.
12127,_MY TALE._,"Before him, still with might and main"
12128,_MY TALE._,"Pulling his rope, the rustic rein,"
12129,_MY TALE._,"A girl: before both him and me,"
12130,_MY TALE._,"Frequent she turns and lets me see,"
12131,_MY TALE._,"Unconscious, lets me scan and trace"
12132,_MY TALE._,The sunny darkness of her face
12133,_MY TALE._,And outlines full of southern grace.
12134,_MY TALE._,"Following I notice, yet and yet,"
12135,_MY TALE._,"Her olive skin, dark eyes deep set,"
12136,_MY TALE._,"And black, and blacker e’en than jet,"
12137,_MY TALE._,"The escaping hair that scantly showed,"
12138,_MY TALE._,"Since o’er it in the country mode,"
12139,_MY TALE._,"For winter warmth and summer shade,"
12140,_MY TALE._,The lap of scarlet cloth is laid.
12141,_MY TALE._,"And then, back-falling from the head,"
12142,_MY TALE._,A crimson kerchief overspread
12143,_MY TALE._,"Her jacket blue; thence passing down,"
12144,_MY TALE._,"A skirt of darkest yellow-brown,"
12145,_MY TALE._,"Coarse stuff, allowing to the view"
12146,_MY TALE._,The smooth limb to the woollen shoe.
12147,_MY TALE._,"But who—here’s some one following too,—"
12148,_MY TALE._,"A priest, and reading at his book!"
12149,_MY TALE._,"Read on, O priest, and do not look;"
12150,_MY TALE._,"Consider,—she is but a child,—"
12151,_MY TALE._,Yet might your fancy be beguiled.
12152,_MY TALE._,"Read on, O priest, and pass and go!"
12153,_MY TALE._,"But see, succeeding in a row,"

12161,_MY TALE._,With butterfly-like velvet hat;
12162,_MY TALE._,"One dame his big bassoon conveys,"
12163,_MY TALE._,On one his gentle arm he lays;
12164,_MY TALE._,"They stop, and look, and something say,"

12168,_MY TALE._,The dark-eyed maiden and the ass
12169,_MY TALE._,Have had the time the bridge to pass.
12170,_MY TALE._,"Vainly, beyond it far descried,"

12209,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"‘I’ve often wondered how it is, at times"
12210,_THE MATE’S STORY._,Good people do what are as bad as crimes.
12211,_THE MATE’S STORY._,A common person would have been ashamed
12212,_THE MATE’S STORY._,To do what once a family far-famed
12213,_THE MATE’S STORY._,For their religious ways was known to do.
12214,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Small harm befell, small thanks to them were due."
12215,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"They from abroad, perhaps it cost them less,"
12216,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Had brought a young French girl as governess,"
12217,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"A pretty, youthful thing as e’er you saw;"
12218,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"She taught the children how to play and draw,"
12219,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Of course, the language of her native land;"
12220,_THE MATE’S STORY._,English she scarcely learnt to understand.
12221,_THE MATE’S STORY._,After a time they wanted her no more;
12222,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"She must go home,—but how to send her o’er,—"
12223,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Far in the south of France she lived, and they"
12224,_THE MATE’S STORY._,In Ireland there—was more than they could say.
12225,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"A monthly steamer, as they chanced to know,"
12226,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"From Liverpool went over to Bordeaux,"
12227,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"And would, they thought, exactly meet the case."
12228,_THE MATE’S STORY._,They wrote and got a friend to take a place;
12229,_THE MATE’S STORY._,And from her salary paid her money down.
12230,_THE MATE’S STORY._,A trading steamer from the seaport town
12231,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Near which they lived, across the Channel plied,"
12232,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"And this, they said, a passage would provide."
12233,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"With pigs, and with the Irish reaping horde,"
12234,_THE MATE’S STORY._,This pretty tender girl was put on board;
12235,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"And a rough time of it, no doubt, had she,"
12236,_THE MATE’S STORY._,Tossing about upon the Irish Sea.
12237,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Arrived at last and set ashore, she found"
12238,_THE MATE’S STORY._,The steamer gone for which she had been bound.
12239,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"The pious people, in their careless way,"
12240,_THE MATE’S STORY._,Had made some loose mistake about the day.
12241,_THE MATE’S STORY._,She stood; the passengers with whom she crossed
12242,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Went off, and she remained as one that’s lost."
12243,_THE MATE’S STORY._,Think of the hapless creature standing here
12244,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Alone, beside her boxes on the pier."
12245,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Whither to turn, and where to try and go,"
12246,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"She knew not; nay, the language did not know."
12247,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"So young a girl, so pretty too, set down"
12248,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Here, in the midst of a great seaport town,"
12249,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"What might have happened one may sadly guess,"
12250,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Had not the captain, seeing her distress,"
12251,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Made out the cause, and told her she could stay"
12252,_THE MATE’S STORY._,On board the vessel till the following day.
12253,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Next day, he said—the steamer to Bordeaux"
12254,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Was gone no doubt, next month the next would go;"
12255,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"For this her passage-money she had paid,"
12256,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"But some arrangement could, he thought, be made,"
12257,_THE MATE’S STORY._,If only she could manage to afford
12258,_THE MATE’S STORY._,To wait a month and pay for bed and board.
12259,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"She sadly shook her head—well, after all,"
12260,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"’Twas a bad town, and mischief might befall."
12261,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Would she go back? Indeed ’twas but a shame,"
12262,_THE MATE’S STORY._,To take her back to those from whom she came.
12263,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"‘There’s one thing, Miss,’ said he, ‘that you can do"
12264,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"It’s speaking somewhat sudden-like, it’s true,"
12265,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"But if you’ll marry me, I’ll marry you."
12266,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"May be you won’t, but if you will you can.’"
12267,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"This captain was a young and decent man,"
12268,_THE MATE’S STORY._,And I suppose she saw no better way;
12269,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Marry they did, and married live this day."
12270,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Another friend, these previous nights away,"
12271,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"An officer of engineers, and round"
12272,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"By Halifax to far Bermuda bound,"
12273,_THE MATE’S STORY._,Joined us this night; a rover he had been.
12274,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Many strange sights and many climes had seen,"
12275,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"And much of various life; his comment was, ’twas well"
12276,_THE MATE’S STORY._,There was no further incident to tell.
12277,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"He’d been afraid that ere the tale was o’er,"
12278,_THE MATE’S STORY._,’Twould prove the captain had a wife before.
12279,_THE MATE’S STORY._,The poor French girl was luckier than she knew;
12280,_THE MATE’S STORY._,Soldiers and sailors had so often two.
12281,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"And it was something, too, for men who went"
12282,_THE MATE’S STORY._,From port to port to be with two content.
12283,_THE MATE’S STORY._,In every place the marriage rite supplied
12284,_THE MATE’S STORY._,A decent spouse to whom you were not tied.
12285,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Of course the women would at times suspect,"
12286,_THE MATE’S STORY._,But felt their reputations were not wrecked.
12287,_THE MATE’S STORY._,
12288,_THE MATE’S STORY._,One after night we took ourselves to task
12289,_THE MATE’S STORY._,For our neglect who had forborne to ask
12290,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"The clergyman, who told his tale so well,"
12291,_THE MATE’S STORY._,Another tale for our behalf to tell.
12292,_THE MATE’S STORY._,He to a second had himself confessed.
12293,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Now, when to hear it eagerly we pressed."
12294,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"He put us off; but, ere the night was done,"
12295,_THE MATE’S STORY._,"Told us his second, and his sadder one."

12366,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"His youthful colour soon, his youthful air"
12367,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Came back; amongst the crowd of idlers there,"

12369,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"For his good looks he gained a sort of fame,"

12375,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Explain the plan of Providence who dare,"

12382,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,She sat exactly opposite to him.
12383,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Ere long he noticed with a vague surprise
12384,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,How every day on him she bent her eyes;
12385,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Soft and inquiring now they looked, and then"
12386,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Wholly withdrawn, unnoticed came again;"
12387,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"His shrunk aside: and yet there came a day,"
12388,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Alas! they did not wholly turn away.
12389,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"So beautiful her beauty was, so strange,"
12390,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And to his northern feeling such a change;
12391,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Her throat and neck Junonian in their grace;
12392,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The blood just mantled in her southern face:
12393,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Dark hair, dark eyes; and all the arts she had"

12395,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Bad women in their youth,—and young was she,"
12396,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Twenty perhaps, at the utmost twenty-three,—"
12397,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And timid seemed, and innocent of ill;—"

12399,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,You will not wish minutely to know all
12400,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,His efforts in the prospect of the fall.
12401,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"He oscillated to and fro, he took"
12402,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"High courage oft, temptation from him shook,"
12403,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Compelled himself to virtuous thoughts and just,"
12404,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And as it were in ashes and in dust
12405,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Abhorred his thought. But living thus alone,"
12406,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Of solitary tedium weary grown;
12407,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"From sweet society so long debarred,"
12408,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And fearing in his judgment to be hard
12409,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,On her—that he was sometimes off his guard
12410,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,What wonder? She relentless still pursued
12411,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Unmarked, and tracked him in his solitude."
12412,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And not in vain, alas!"
12413,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The days went by and found him in the snare.
12414,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,But soon a letter full of tenderest care
12415,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Came from his wife, the little daughter too"
12416,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,In a large hand—the exercise was new—
12417,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,To her papa her love and kisses sent.
12418,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Into his very heart and soul it went.
12419,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Forth on the high and dusty road he sought
12420,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Some issue for the vortex of his thought.
12421,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Returned, packed up his things, and ere the day"
12422,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Descended, was a hundred miles away."
12423,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"There are, I know of course, who lightly treat"
12424,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Such slips; we stumble, we regain our feet;"
12425,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"What can we do? they say, but hasten on"
12426,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And disregard it as a thing that’s gone.
12427,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Many there are who in a case like this
12428,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Would calm re-seek their sweet domestic bliss;
12429,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Accept unshamed the wifely tender kiss,"
12430,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And lift their little children on their knees,"
12431,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And take their kisses too; with hearts at ease
12432,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Will read the household prayers,—to church will go,"
12433,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And sacrament,—nor care if people know."
12434,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Such men—so minded—do exist, God knows,"
12435,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And, God be thanked, this was not one of those."

12437,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"In France, a passing traveller was put down;"
12438,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Haggard he looked, his hair was turning grey,"
12439,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"His hair, his clothes, were much in disarray:"
12440,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"In a bedchamber here one day he stayed,"
12441,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Wrote letters, posted them, his reckoning paid"
12442,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And went. ’Twas Edward rushing from his fall
12443,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Here to his wife he wrote and told her all.
12444,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Forgiveness—yes, perhaps she might forgive—"
12445,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"For her, and for the children, he must live"
12446,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,At any rate; but their old home to share
12447,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,As yet was something that he could not bear.
12448,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"She with her mother still her home should make,"
12449,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,A lodging near the office he should take;
12450,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And once a quarter he would bring his pay,"
12451,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And he would see her on the quarter-day,"
12452,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"But her alone; e’en this would dreadful be,"
12453,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The children ’twas not possible to see.
12454,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Back to the office at this early day
12455,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"To see him come, old-looking thus and grey,"
12456,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"His comrades wondered, wondered too to see"
12457,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"How dire a passion for his work had he,"
12458,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,How in a garret too he lived alone;
12459,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"So cold a husband, cold a father grown."
12460,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"In a green lane beside her mother’s home,"
12461,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Where in old days they had been used to roam,"
12462,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"His wife had met him on the appointed day,"
12463,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Fell on his neck, said all that love could say,"
12464,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And wept; he put the loving arms away.
12465,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"At dusk they met, for so was his desire;"
12466,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,She felt his cheeks and forehead all on fire;
12467,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The kisses which she gave he could not brook;
12468,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Once in her face he gave a sidelong look,"
12469,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Said, but for them he wished that he were dead,"
12470,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And put the money in her hand and fled.
12471,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Sometimes in easy and familiar tone,"
12472,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Of sins resembling more or less his own
12473,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"He heard his comrades in the office speak,"
12474,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And felt the colour tingling in his cheek;
12475,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Lightly they spoke as of a thing of nought;
12476,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,He of their judgment ne’er so much as thought.
12477,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"I know not, in his solitary pains,"
12478,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Whether he seemed to feel as in his veins
12479,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"The moral mischief circulating still,"
12480,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Racked with the torture of the double will;
12481,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And like some frontier-land where armies wage
12482,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"The mighty wars, engage and yet engage"
12483,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,All through the summer in the fierce campaign;
12484,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"March, counter-march, gain, lose, and yet regain;"
12485,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,With battle reeks the desolated plain;
12486,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,So felt his nature yielded to the strife
12487,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Of the contending good and ill of life.
12488,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"But a whole year this penance he endured,"
12489,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Nor even then would think that he was cured.
12490,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Once in a quarter, in the country lane,"
12491,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,He met his wife and paid his quarter’s gain;
12492,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,To bring the children she besought in vain.
12493,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"He has a life small happiness that gives,"
12494,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Who friendless in a London lodging lives,"
12495,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Dines in a dingy chop-house, and returns"
12496,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,To a lone room while all within him yearns
12497,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"For sympathy, and his whole nature burns"
12498,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"With a fierce thirst for some one,—is there none?—"
12499,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,To expend his human tenderness upon.
12500,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"So blank, and hard, and stony is the way"
12501,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"To walk, I wonder not men go astray."
12502,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Edward, whom still a sense that never slept"
12503,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"On the strict path undeviating kept,"
12504,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,One winter-evening found himself pursued
12505,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Amidst the dusky thronging multitude.
12506,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Quickly he walked, but strangely swift was she,"
12507,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And pertinacious, and would make him see."
12508,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"He saw at last, and recognising slow,"
12509,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Discovered in this hapless thing of woe
12510,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The occasion of his shame twelve wretched months ago.
12511,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"She gaily laughed, she cried, and sought his hand,"
12512,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And spoke sweet phrases of her native land;
12513,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Exiled, she said, her lovely home had left,"
12514,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Not to forsake a friend of all but her bereft;
12515,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Exiled, she cried, for liberty, for love,"
12516,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,She was; still limpid eyes she turned above.
12517,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"So beauteous once, and now such misery in,"
12518,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Pity had all but softened him to sin;
12519,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"But while she talked, and wildly laughed, and cried,"
12520,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And plucked the hand which sadly he denied,"
12521,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,A stranger came and swept her from his side.
12522,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"He watched them in the gas-lit darkness go,"
12523,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And a voice said within him, Even so,"
12524,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,So midst the gloomy mansions where they dwell
12525,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The lost souls walk the flaming streets of hell!
12526,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"The lamps appeared to fling a baleful glare,"
12527,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,A brazen heat was heavy in the air;
12528,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And it was hell, and he some unblest wanderer there."
12529,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"For a long hour he stayed the streets to roam,"
12530,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Late gathering sense, he gained his garret home;"
12531,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,There found a telegraph that bade him come
12532,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Straight to the country, where his daughter, still"
12533,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"His darling child, lay dangerously ill."
12534,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The doctor would he bring? Away he went
12535,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And found the doctor; to the office sent
12536,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"A letter, asking leave, and went again,"
12537,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And with a wild confusion in his brain,"
12538,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Joining the doctor caught the latest train.
12539,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The train swift whirled them from the city light
12540,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Into the shadows of the natural night.
12541,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"’Twas silent starry midnight on the down,"
12542,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Silent and chill, when they, straight come from town,"
12543,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Leaving the station, walked a mile to gain"
12544,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"The lonely house amid the hills where Jane,"
12545,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Her mother, and her children should be found."
12546,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Waked by their entrance, but of sleep unsound,"
12547,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The child not yet her altered father knew;
12548,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Yet talked of her papa in her delirium too.
12549,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Danger there was, yet hope there was; and he,"
12550,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"To attend the crisis, and the changes see,"
12551,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And take the steps, at hand should surely be."
12552,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Said Jane the following day, ‘Edward, you know,"
12553,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Over and over I have told you so,"
12554,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"As in a better world I seek to live,"
12555,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"As I desire forgiveness, I forgive."
12556,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Forgiveness does not feel the word to say,—"
12557,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,As I believe in One who takes away
12558,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Our sin and gives us righteousness instead,—"
12559,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"You to this sin, I do believe, are dead."
12560,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"’Twas I, you know, who let you leave your home"
12561,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And bade you stay when you so wished to come;
12562,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"My fault was that: I’ve told you so before,"
12563,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And vainly told; but now ’tis something more.
12564,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Say, is it right, without a single friend,"
12565,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Without advice, to leave me to attend"
12566,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Children and mother both? Indeed I’ve thought
12567,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Through want of you the child her fever caught.
12568,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Chances of mischief come with every hour.
12569,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,It is not in a single woman’s power
12570,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Alone, and ever haunted more or less"
12571,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"With anxious thoughts of you and your distress,—"
12572,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"’Tis not indeed, I’m sure of it, in me,—"
12573,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,All things with perfect judgment to foresee.
12574,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,This weight has grown too heavy to endure;
12575,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And you, I tell you now, and I am sure,"
12576,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Neglect your duty both to God and man
12577,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Persisting thus in your unnatural plan.
12578,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"This feeling you must conquer, for you can."
12579,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And after all, you know we are but dust,"
12580,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"What are we, in ourselves that we should trust?’"
12581,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,He scarcely answered her; but he obtained
12582,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"A longer leave, and quietly remained."
12583,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Slowly the child recovered, long was ill,"
12584,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Long delicate, and he must watch her still;"
12585,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"To give up seeing her he could not bear,"
12586,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"To leave her less attended, did not dare."
12587,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"The child recovered slowly, slowly too"
12588,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Recovered he, and more familiar drew"
12589,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Home’s happy breath; and apprehension o’er,"
12590,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Their former life he yielded to restore,"
12591,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And to his mournful garret went no more.
12592,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,
12593,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,*       *       *       *       *
12594,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,
12595,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Midnight was dim and hazy overhead
12596,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,When the tale ended and we turned to bed.
12597,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"On the companion-way, descending slow,"
12598,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"The artillery captain, as we went below,"
12599,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Said to the lawyer, life could not be meant"
12600,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,To be so altogether innocent.
12601,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"What did the atonement show? he, for the rest,"
12602,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Could not, he thought, have written and confessed."
12603,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Weakness it was, and adding crime to crime"
12604,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"To leave his family that length of time,"
12605,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The lawyer said; the American was sure
12606,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Each nature knows instinctively its cure.
12607,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Midnight was in the cabin still and dead,"
12608,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Our fellow-passengers were all in bed,"
12609,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"We followed them, and nothing further spoke."
12610,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Out of the sweetest of my sleep I woke
12611,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"At two, and felt we stopped; amid a dream"
12612,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Of England knew the letting-off of steam
12613,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And rose. ’Twas fog, and were we off Cape Race?"
12614,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The captain would be certain of his place.
12615,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Wild in white vapour flew away the force,"
12616,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And self-arrested was the eager course
12617,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,That had not ceased before. But shortly now
12618,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,Cape Race was made to starboard on the bow.
12619,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The paddles plied. I slept. The following night
12620,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"In the mid seas we saw a quay and light,"
12621,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And peered through mist into an unseen town,"
12622,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And on scarce-seeming land set one companion down,"
12623,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"And went. With morning and a shining sun,"
12624,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Under the bright New Brunswick coast we run,"
12625,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,And visible discern to every eye
12626,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Rocks, pines, and little ports, and passing by"
12627,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,The boats and coasting craft. When sunk the night
12628,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Early now sunk, the northern streamers bright"
12629,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Floated and flashed, the cliffs and clouds behind,"
12630,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,With phosphorus the billows all were lined.
12631,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"That evening, while the arctic streamers bright"
12632,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"Rolled from the clouds in waves of airy light,"
12633,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"The lawyer said, ‘I laid by for to-night"
12634,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,A story that I would not tell before;
12635,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,"For the last time, a confidential four,"
12636,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,We meet. Receive in your elected ears
12637,_THE CLERGYMAN’S SECOND TALE._,A tale of human suffering and tears.’

12645,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A single parlour, single bed that fills"
12646,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"With fisher or with tourist, as may be;"
12647,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A waiting-maid, as fair as you can see,"
12648,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"With hazel eyes, and frequent blushing face,"
12649,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And ample brow, and with a rustic grace"
12650,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"In all her easy quiet motions seen,"
12651,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Large of her age, which haply is nineteen,"
12652,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Christian her name, in full a pleasant name,"
12653,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Christian and Christie scarcely seem the same;—
12654,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A college fellow, who has sent away"
12655,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The pupils he has taught for many a day,"
12656,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And comes for fishing and for solitude,"
12657,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Perhaps a little pensive in his mood,"
12658,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"An aspiration and a thought have failed,"
12659,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Where he had hoped, another has prevailed,"
12660,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But to the joys of hill and stream alive,"
12661,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And in his boyhood yet, at twenty-five."
12662,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A merry dance, that made young people meet,"
12663,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And set them moving, both with hands and feet;"
12664,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A dance in which he danced, and nearer knew"
12665,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The soft brown eyes, and found them tender too."
12666,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A dance that lit in two young hearts the fire,"
12667,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The low soft flame, of loving sweet desire,"
12668,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And made him feel that he could feel again;—
12669,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The preface this, what follows to explain."
12670,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"That night he kissed, he held her in his arms,"
12671,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And felt the subtle virtue of her charms;
12672,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Nor less bewildered on the following day,"
12673,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He kissed, he found excuse near her to stay,—"
12674,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Was it not love? And yet the truth to speak,"
12675,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Playing the fool for haply half a week,"
12676,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He yet had fled, so strong within him dwelt"
12677,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The horror of the sin, and such he felt"
12678,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The miseries to the woman that ensue.
12679,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He wearied long his brain with reasonings fine,"
12680,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But when at evening dusk he came to dine,"
12681,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,In linsey petticoat and jacket blue
12682,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"She stood, so radiant and so modest too,"
12683,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,All into air his strong conclusions flew.
12684,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Now should he go. But dim and drizzling too,"
12685,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"For a night march, to-night will hardly do,"
12686,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,A march of sixteen weary miles of way.
12687,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"No, by the chances which our lives obey,"
12688,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"No, by the heavens and this sweet face he’ll stay."
12689,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,
12690,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A week he stayed, and still was loth to go,"
12691,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,But she grew anxious and would have it so.
12692,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Her time of service shortly would be o’er,"
12693,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And she would leave; her mistress knew before.
12694,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Where would she go? To Glasgow, if she could;"
12695,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Her father’s sister would be kind and good;
12696,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"An only child she was, an orphan left,"
12697,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Of all her kindred, save of this, bereft."
12698,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Said he, ‘Your guide to Glasgow let me be,"
12699,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"You little know, you have not tried the sea;"
12700,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Say, at the ferry when are we to meet?"
12701,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Thither, I guess, you travel on your feet.’"
12702,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,She would be there on Tuesday next at three;
12703,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘O dear, how glad and thankful she would be;"
12704,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But don’t,’ she said, ‘be troubled much for me.’"
12705,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Punctual they met, a second class he took,"
12706,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"More naturally to her wants to look,"
12707,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And from her side was seldom far away.
12708,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"So quiet, so indifferent yet, were they,"
12709,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"As fellow-servants travelling south they seemed,"
12710,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And no one of a love-relation dreamed.
12711,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"At Oban, where the stormy darkness fell,"
12712,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He got two chambers in a cheap hotel.
12713,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"At Oban of discomfort one is sure,"
12714,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Little the difference whether rich or poor.
12715,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Around the Mull the passage now to make,"
12716,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"They go aboard, and separate tickets take,"
12717,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"First-class for him, and second-class for her."
12718,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"No other first-class passengers there were,"
12719,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And with the captain walking soon alone,"
12720,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"This Highland girl, he said, to him was known."
12721,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He had engaged to take her to her kin;
12722,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Could she be put the ladies’ cabin in?
12723,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The difference gladly he himself would pay,"
12724,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The weather seemed but menacing to-day.
12725,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"She ne’er had travelled from her home before,"
12726,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He wished to be at hand to hear about her more.
12727,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Curious it seemed, but he had such a tone,"
12728,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And kept at first so carefully alone,"
12729,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And she so quiet was, and so discreet,"
12730,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"So heedful, ne’er to seek him or to meet,"
12731,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The first small wonder quickly passed away.
12732,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And so from Oban’s little land-locked bay
12733,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Forth out to Jura—Jura pictured high
12734,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"With lofty peaks against the western sky,"
12735,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Jura, that far o’erlooks the Atlantic seas,"
12736,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The loftiest of the Southern Hebrides.
12737,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Through the main sea to Jura;—when we reach
12738,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Jura, we turn to leftward to the breach,"
12739,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And southward strain the narrow channel through,"
12740,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And Colonsay we pass and Islay too;
12741,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Cantire is on the left, and all the day"
12742,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,A dull dead calm upon the waters lay.
12743,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Sitting below, after some length of while,"
12744,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He sought her, and the tedium to beguile,"
12745,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He ventured some experiments to make,"
12746,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The measure of her intellect to take.
12747,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Upon the cabin table chanced to lie
12748,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,A book of popular astronomy;
12749,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"In this he tried her, and discoursed away"
12750,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Of Winter, Summer, and of Night and Day."
12751,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Still to the task a reasoning power she brought,"
12752,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And followed, slowly followed with the thought;"
12753,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,How beautiful it was to see the stir
12754,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Of natural wonder waking thus in her;
12755,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,But loth was he to set on books to pore
12756,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,An intellect so charming in the ore.
12757,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And she, perhaps, had comprehended soon"
12758,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Even the nodes, so puzzling, of the moon;"
12759,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,But nearing now the Mull they met the gale
12760,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Right in their teeth: and should the fuel fail?
12761,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Thinking of her, he grew a little pale,"
12762,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But bravely she the terrors, miseries, took:"
12763,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And met him with a sweet courageous look:
12764,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Once, at the worst, unto his side she drew,"
12765,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And said a little tremulously too,"
12766,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘If we must die, please let me come to you.’"
12767,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"I know not by what change of wind or tide,"
12768,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Heading the Mull, they gained the eastern side,"
12769,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But stiller now, and sunny e’en it grew;"
12770,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Arran’s high peaks unmantled to the view;
12771,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"While to the north, far seen from left to right,"
12772,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The Highland range, extended snowy white."
12773,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Now in the Clyde, he asked, what would be thought,"
12774,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"In Glasgow, of the company she brought:"
12775,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘You know,’ he said, ‘how I desire to stay;"
12776,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"We’ve played at strangers for so long a day,"
12777,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,But for a while I yet would go away.’
12778,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"She said, O no, indeed they must not part."
12779,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Her father’s sister had a kindly heart.
12780,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘I’ll tell her all, and O, when you she sees,"
12781,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,I think she’ll not be difficult to please.’
12782,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Landed at Glasgow, quickly they espied"
12783,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Macfarlane, grocer, by the river side:"
12784,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"To greet her niece the woman joyful ran,"
12785,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,But looked with wonder on the tall young man
12786,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Into the house the women went and talked,"
12787,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He with the grocer in the doorway walked.
12788,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He told him he was looking for a set
12789,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Of lodgings: had he any he could let?
12790,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The man was called to council with his wife;
12791,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"They took the thing as what will be in life,"
12792,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Half in a kind, half in a worldly way;"
12793,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"They said, the lassie might play out her play."
12794,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The gentleman should have the second floor,"
12795,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"At thirty shillings, for a week or more."
12796,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Some days in this obscurity he stayed,"
12797,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Happy with her, and some inquiry made"
12798,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"(For friends he found) and did his best to see,"
12799,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,What hope of getting pupils there would be.
12800,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"This must he do, ’twas evident, ’twas clear,"
12801,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Marry and seek a humble maintenance here.
12802,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Himself he had a hundred pounds a year.
12803,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"To this plain business he would bend his life,"
12804,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And find his joy in children and in wife,"
12805,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A wife so good, so tender, and so true,"
12806,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Mother to be of glorious children too.
12807,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Half to excuse his present lawless way,"
12808,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He to the grocer happened once to say
12809,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Marriage would cost him more than others dear,"
12810,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Cost him, indeed, three hundred pounds a-year."
12811,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘’Deed,’ said the man, ‘a heavy price, no doubt,"
12812,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,For a bit form that one can do without.’
12813,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And asked some questions, pertinent and plain,"
12814,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Exacter information to obtain;
12815,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He took a little trouble to explain.
12816,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The College Audit now, to last at least"
12817,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Three weeks, ere ending with the College Feast,"
12818,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He must attend, a tedious, dull affair,"
12819,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But he, as junior Bursar, must be there."
12820,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Three weeks, however, quickly would be fled,"
12821,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And then he’d come,—he didn’t say to wed."
12822,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"With plans of which he nothing yet would say,"
12823,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Preoccupied upon the parting day,"
12824,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He seemed a little absent and distrait;
12825,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But she, as knowing nothing was amiss,"
12826,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Gave him her fondest smile, her sweetest kiss."
12827,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A fortnight after, or a little more,"
12828,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"As at the Audit, weary of the bore,"
12829,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He sat, and of his future prospects thought,"
12830,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,A letter in an unknown hand was brought.
12831,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"’Twas from Macfarlane, and to let him know"
12832,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,To South Australia they proposed to go.
12833,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘Rich friends we have, who have advised us thus,"
12834,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Occasion offers suitable for us;
12835,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Christie we take; whate’er she find of new,"
12836,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,She’ll ne’er forget the joy she’s had with you;
12837,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"’Tis an expensive pilgrimage to make,"
12838,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,You’ll like to send a trifle for her sake.’
12839,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Nothing he said of when the ship would sail.
12840,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"That very night, by swift-returning mail,"
12841,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Ten pounds he sent, for what he did not know;"
12842,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And ‘In no case,’ he said, ‘let Christian go.’"
12843,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He in three days would come, and for his life"
12844,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Would claim her and declare her as his wife.
12845,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Swift the night-mail conveyed his missive on;
12846,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He followed in three days, and found them gone."
12847,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,All three had sailed: he looked as though he dreamed;
12848,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The money-order had been cashed, it seemed."
12849,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,
12850,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The Clergyman, ‘This story is mere pain,’"
12851,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Exclaimed, ‘for if the women don’t sustain"
12852,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The moral standard, all we do is vain.’"
12853,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘But what we want,’ the Yankee said, ‘to know,"
12854,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Is if the girl went willingly or no.
12855,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Sufficient motive though one does not see,"
12856,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,’Tis clear the grocer used some trickery.’
12857,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,
12858,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He judged himself, so strong the clinging in"
12859,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,This kind of people is to kith and kin;
12860,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"For if they went and she remained behind,"
12861,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"No one she had, if him she failed to find."
12862,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Alas, this lawless loving was the cause,"
12863,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,She did not dare to think how dear she was.
12864,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Justly his guilty tardiness he curst,"
12865,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He should have owned her when he left her first.
12866,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And something added how upon the sea,"
12867,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"She perilled, too, a life that was to be;"
12868,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A child that, born in far Australia, there"
12869,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Would have no father and no father’s care.
12870,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"So to the South a lonely man returned,"
12871,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"For other scenes and busier life he burned,—"
12872,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"College he left and settled soon in town,"
12873,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Wrote in the journals, gained a swift renown."
12874,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Soon into high society he came,"
12875,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And still where’er he went outdid his fame.
12876,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"All the more liked and more esteemed, the less"
12877,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He seemed to make an object of success.
12878,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"An active literary life he spent,"
12879,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Towards lofty points of public practice bent,"
12880,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Was never man so carefully who read,"
12881,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Whose plans so well were fashioned in his head,"
12882,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Nor one who truths so luminously said.
12883,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Some years in various labours thus he passed,"
12884,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,A spotless course maintaining to the last.
12885,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Twice upon Government Commissions served
12886,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"With honour; place, which he declined, deserved."
12887,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He married then,—a marriage fit and good,"
12888,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,That kept him where his worth was understood;
12889,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A widow, wealthy, and of noble blood."
12890,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Mr. and Lady Mary are they styled,"
12891,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,One grief is theirs—to be without a child.
12892,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,I did not tell you how he went before
12893,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"To South Australia, vainly to explore."
12894,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The ship had come to Adelaide, no doubt;"
12895,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Watching the papers he had made it out,"
12896,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But of themselves, in country or in town,"
12897,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Nothing discovered, travelling up and down."
12898,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Only an entry of uncertain sound,"
12899,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,In an imperfect register he found.
12900,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"His son, he thought, but could not prove it true;"
12901,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The surname of the girl it chanced he never knew.
12902,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,But this uneasy feeling gathered strength
12903,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"As years advanced, and it became at length"
12904,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,His secret torture and his secret joy
12905,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,To think about his lost Australian boy.
12906,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Somewhere in wild colonial lands has grown
12907,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,A child that is his true and very own.
12908,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"This strong parental passion fills his mind,"
12909,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,To all the dubious chances makes him blind.
12910,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Still he will seek, and still he hopes to find."
12911,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Again will go.
12912,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Said I, ‘O let him stay,"
12913,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And in a London drawing-room some day—
12914,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Rings on her fingers, brilliants in her hair,"
12915,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The lady of the latest millionaire—
12916,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"She’ll come, and with a gathering slow surprise"
12917,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,On Lady Mary’s husband turn her eyes:
12918,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The soft brown eyes that in a former day
12919,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,From his discretion lured him all astray.
12920,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"At home, six bouncing girls, who more or less"
12921,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Are learning English of a governess,"
12922,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Six boisterous boys, as like as pear to pear;"
12923,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Only the eldest has a different air.’
12924,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,
12925,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘You jest,’ he said, ‘indeed it happened so.’"
12926,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"From a great party just about to go,"
12927,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He saw, he knew, and ere she saw him, said"
12928,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Swift to his wife, as for the door he made,"
12929,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘My Highland bride! to escape a scene I go,"
12930,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Stay, find her out—great God!—and let me know.’"
12931,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The Lady Mary turned to scrutinise
12932,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The lovely brow, the beautiful brown eyes,"
12933,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"One moment, then performed her perfect part,"
12934,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And did her spiriting with simplest art,"
12935,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Was introduced, her former friends had known,"
12936,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Say, might she call to-morrow afternoon"
12937,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"At three? O yes! At three she made her call,"
12938,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And told her who she was and told her all.
12939,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Her lady manners all she laid aside;
12940,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Like women the two women kissed and cried.
12941,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Half overwhelmed sat Christian by her side,"
12942,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"While she, ‘You know he never knew the day"
12943,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"When you would sail, but he believed you’d stay"
12944,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Because he wrote—you never knew, you say,—"
12945,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Wrote that in three days’ time, they need not fear,"
12946,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He’d come and then would marry you, my dear."
12947,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,You never knew? And he had planned to live
12948,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"At Glasgow, lessons had arranged to give."
12949,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Alas, then to Australia he went out,"
12950,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"All through the land to find you sought about,"
12951,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And found a trace, which though it left a doubt."
12952,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Sufficed to make it still his grief, his joy,"
12953,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"To think he had a child, a living boy,"
12954,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Whom you, my love——’"
12955,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘His child is six foot high,"
12956,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"I’ve kept him as the apple of my eye,’"
12957,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Cried she, ‘he’s riding, or you’d see him here."
12958,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O joy, that he at last should see his father dear!"
12959,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"As soon as he comes in I’ll tell him all,"
12960,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And on his father he shall go and call.’
12961,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘And you,’ she said, ‘my husband will you see?"
12962,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘O no, it is not possible for me."
12963,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The boy I’ll send this very afternoon.
12964,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O dear, I know he cannot go too soon;"
12965,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And something I must write, to write will do.’"
12966,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,So they embraced and sadly bade adieu.
12967,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The boy came in, his father went and saw!"
12968,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,We will not wait this interview to draw;
12969,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Ere long returned, and to his mother ran:"
12970,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"His father was a wonderful fine man,"
12971,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He said, and looked at her; the Lady, too,"
12972,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Had done whatever it was kind to do.
12973,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He loved his mother more than he could say,"
12974,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But if she wished, he’d with his father stay."
12975,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"A little change she noticed in his face,"
12976,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,E’en now the father’s influence she could trace;
12977,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"From her the slight, slight severance had begun,"
12978,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,But simply she rejoiced that it was done.
12979,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"She smiled and kissed her boy, and ‘Long ago,"
12980,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"When I was young, I loved your father so."
12981,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Together now we had been living, too,"
12982,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Only the ship went sooner than he knew.
12983,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,In loving him you will be loving me:
12984,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Father and mother are as one you see.’
12985,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Her letter caught him on the following day
12986,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,As to the club he started on his way.
12987,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"From her he guessed, the hand indeed was new;"
12988,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Back to his room he went and read it through.
12989,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,‘I know not how to write and dare not see;
12990,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,But it will take a load of grief from me—
12991,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,O! what a load—that you at last should know
12992,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The way in which I was compelled to go.
12993,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Wretched, I know, and yet it seems ’twas more"
12994,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Cruel and wretched than I knew before;
12995,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,So many years to think how on your day
12996,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Joyful you’d come, and found me flown away."
12997,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"What would you think of me, what would you say?"
12998,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O love, this little let me call you so;"
12999,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,What other name to use I do not know
13000,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O let me think that by your side I sit,"
13001,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And tell it you, and weep a little bit,"
13002,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And you too weep with me, for hearing it."
13003,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Alone so long I’ve borne this dreadful weight;
13004,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Such grief, at times it almost turned to hate."
13005,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O let me think you sit and listening long,"
13006,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Comfort me still, and say I wasn’t wrong,"
13007,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And pity me, and far, far hence again"
13008,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Dismiss, if haply any yet remain,"
13009,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Hard thoughts of me that in your heart have lain.
13010,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,O love! to hear your voice I dare not go;
13011,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,But let me trust that you will judge me so.
13012,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘I think no sooner were you gone away,"
13013,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"My aunt began to tell me of some pay,"
13014,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"More than three hundred pounds a-year ’twould be,"
13015,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Which you, she said, would lose by marrying me."
13016,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Was this a thing a man of sense would do?
13017,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Was I a fool, to look for it from you?"
13018,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"You were a handsome gentleman and kind,"
13019,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And to do right were every way inclined,"
13020,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But to this truth I must submit my mind,"
13021,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"You would not marry. “Speak, and tell me true,"
13022,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Say, has he ever said one word to you"
13023,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"That meant as much?” O, love, I knew you would."
13024,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"I’ve read it in your eyes so kind and good,"
13025,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Although you did not speak I understood.
13026,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Though for myself, indeed, I sought it not,"
13027,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"It seemed so high, so undeserved a lot,"
13028,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But for the child, when it should come, I knew—"
13029,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O, I was certain—what you meant to do."
13030,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"She said, “We quit the land, will it be right"
13031,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Or kind to leave you for a single night,"
13032,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Just on the chance that he will come down here,"
13033,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And sacrifice three hundred pounds a-year,"
13034,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And all his hopes and prospects fling away,"
13035,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And has already had his will, as one may say?"
13036,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Go you with us, and find beyond the seas,"
13037,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Men by the score to choose from, if you please.”"
13038,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"I said my will and duty was to stay,"
13039,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Would they not help me to some decent way
13040,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"To wait, and surely near was now the day?"
13041,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Quite they refused; had they to let you know
13042,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Written, I asked, to say we were to go?"
13043,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"They told me yes; they showed a letter, too,"
13044,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Post-office order that had come from you.
13045,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Alas, I could not read or write, they knew."
13046,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"I think they meant me, though they did not say,"
13047,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,To think you wanted me to go away;
13048,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O, love, I’m thankful nothing of the kind"
13049,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Ever so much as came into my mind.
13050,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,‘To-morrow was the day that would not fail;
13051,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,For Adelaide the vessel was to sail.
13052,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"All night I hoped some dreadful wind would rise,"
13053,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And lift the seas and rend the very skies.
13054,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,All night I lay and listened hard for you.
13055,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Twice to the door I went, the bolt I drew,"
13056,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And called to you; scarce what I did I knew.
13057,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘Morning grew light, the house was emptied clear;"
13058,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"The ship would go, the boat was lying near."
13059,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"They had my money, how was I to stay?"
13060,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Who could I go to, when they went away?"
13061,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Out in the streets I could not lie, you know."
13062,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O dear, but it was terrible to go."
13063,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Yet, yet I looked; I do not know what passed,"
13064,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,I think they took and carried me at last.
13065,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Twelve hours I lay, and sobbed in my distress;"
13066,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But in the night, let be this idleness,"
13067,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"I said, I’ll bear it for my baby’s sake,"
13068,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Lest of my going mischief it should take,"
13069,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Advice will seek, and every caution use;"
13070,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,My love I’ve lost—his child I must not lose.
13071,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘How oft I thought, when sailing on the seas,"
13072,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Of our dear journey through the Hebrides,"
13073,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,When you the kindest were and best of men:
13074,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O, love, I did not love you right till then."
13075,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O, and myself how willingly I blamed,"
13076,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"So simple who had been, and was ashamed,"
13077,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"So mindful only of the present joy,"
13078,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,When you had anxious cares your busy mind to employ.
13079,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Ah, well, I said, but now at least he’s free,"
13080,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He will not have to lower himself for me.
13081,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He will not lose three hundred pounds a-year,"
13082,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,In many ways my love has cost him dear.
13083,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘Upon the passage, great was my delight,"
13084,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,A lady taught me how to read and write.
13085,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"She saw me much, and fond of me she grew,"
13086,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Only I durst not talk to her of you.
13087,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘We had a quiet time upon the seas,"
13088,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And reached our port of Adelaide with ease.
13089,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,At Adelaide my lovely baby came.
13090,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Philip, he took his father’s Christian name,"
13091,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And my poor maiden surname, to my shame."
13092,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O, but I little cared, I loved him so,"
13093,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,’Twas such a joy to watch and see him grow.
13094,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,At Adelaide we made no length of stay;
13095,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Our friends to Melbourne just had gone away.
13096,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"We followed shortly where they led before,"
13097,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"To Melbourne went, and flourished more and more."
13098,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,My aunt and uncle both are buried there;
13099,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"I closed their eyes, and I was left their heir."
13100,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"They meant me well, I loved them for their care."
13101,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,‘Ten years ago I married Robert; dear
13102,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And well he loved, and waited many a year."
13103,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Selfish it seemed to turn from one so true,"
13104,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,And I of course was desperate of you.
13105,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,I’ve borne him children six; we’ve left behind
13106,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Three little ones, whom soon I hope to find."
13107,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,To my dear boy he ever has been kind.
13108,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"‘Next week we sail, and I should be so glad,"
13109,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Only to leave my boy will make me sad.
13110,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"But yours he is by right—the grief I’ll bear,"
13111,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"And at his age, more easy he can spare,"
13112,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Perhaps, a mother’s than a father’s care."
13113,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Indeed I think him like his father, too;"
13114,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"He will be happier, probably, with you."
13115,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"’Tis best, I know, nor will he quite forget,"
13116,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Some day he’ll come perhaps and see his mother yet.
13117,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,‘O heaven! farewell—perhaps I’ve been to blame
13118,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,To write as if it all were still the same.
13119,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Farewell, write not.—I will not seek to know"
13120,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Whether you ever think of me or no.’
13121,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"O love, love, love, too late! the tears fell down."
13122,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,He dried them up—and slowly walked to town.

13129,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,Upon the left we watched with curious eyes
13130,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The Puritan great Mother City rise.
13131,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,"Among the islets, winding in and round,"
13132,_THE LAWYER’S SECOND TALE._,The great ship moved to her appointed ground.

13436,_SONGS IN ABSENCE._[17],"For men, that will not idlers be,"

13611,(I. 1-32.),
13612,(I. 1-32.),"Goddess, the anger sing of the Pelean Achilles,"
13613,(I. 1-32.),Fatal beginning of griefs unnumbered to the Achæans;
13614,(I. 1-32.),"Many valiant souls untimely it hurried to Hades,"
13615,(I. 1-32.),And the heroes left themselves of dogs to be eaten
13616,(I. 1-32.),And of ravenous birds—till Zeus’s plan was accomplished—
13617,(I. 1-32.),From the day when first contention arose to dissever
13618,(I. 1-32.),Atrides the King and the godlike hero Achilles.
13619,(I. 1-32.),What divinity thus incited them to contention?—
13620,(I. 1-32.),"Zeus and Leto’s son; who, in anger with Agamemnon,"
13621,(I. 1-32.),"Sent a deadly disease on the host, destroying the people,"
13622,(I. 1-32.),"On account of the wrong the King to his worshipper offered,"
13623,(I. 1-32.),"Chryses, who had come to the hollow ships of Achaia,"
13624,(I. 1-32.),"To recover his daughter, with gifts of costly redemption,"
13625,(I. 1-32.),Carrying in his hands the wreaths of the archer Apollo
13626,(I. 1-32.),"Set on a golden staff—beseeching all the Achæans,"
13627,(I. 1-32.),"And the Atridæ in chief, the two in command of the nations:"
13628,(I. 1-32.),"‘Ye, Atreus’ sons, and other well-greaved Achaïan heroes,"
13629,(I. 1-32.),"May the gods, who live in Olympian houses, accord you"
13630,(I. 1-32.),"Capture of Priam’s town and safe to return to Achaia,"
13631,(I. 1-32.),But liberate to me my child and take the redemption—
13632,(I. 1-32.),"Fearing Zeus’s son, the far-death-dealing Apollo.’"
13633,(I. 1-32.),"Then the Achæans all with acclamation assented,"
13634,(I. 1-32.),"Honour to show to the priest, and take the costly redemption;"
13635,(I. 1-32.),"Only to Atrides Agamemnon it was unpleasing,"
13636,(I. 1-32.),Sternly who dismissed him with contumelious answer:
13637,(I. 1-32.),"‘Old man, let me not, by the hollow ships of Achaia"
13638,(I. 1-32.),"Lingering find you now, or henceforth ever appearing,"
13639,(I. 1-32.),Lest to defend you fail the staff and wreaths of Apollo.
13640,(I. 1-32.),"Her do I not release until old age come upon her,"
13641,(I. 1-32.),"In my house in the land of Argos, far from her country,"
13642,(I. 1-32.),Stepping at the loom and in the chamber attending.
13643,(I. 1-32.),"Go, and trouble me not, that your return be the safer.’"
13644,(I. 1-32.),
13645,(I. 1-32.),
13646,(I. 121-218.),(I. 121-218.)
13647,(I. 121-218.),
13648,(I. 121-218.),"And replying, said godlike, swift-footed Achilles:"
13649,(I. 121-218.),"‘Atrides, our chief, as in rank, so in love of possessions,"
13650,(I. 121-218.),"Say, in what way shall the noble Achæans find you a present?"
13651,(I. 121-218.),"Little we yet have gained the general stock to replenish,"
13652,(I. 121-218.),"Distributed were all the spoils we took from the cities,"
13653,(I. 121-218.),And to recall our gifts and reapportion befits not—
13654,(I. 121-218.),"Yield you the maiden to-day to the god, and we, the Achæans,"
13655,(I. 121-218.),"Three or four times over will compensate it, if ever"
13656,(I. 121-218.),Zeus the capture accord of the well-walled Ilian city.’
13657,(I. 121-218.),And with words of reply the King Agamemnon addressed him:
13658,(I. 121-218.),"‘Think not, great as you are, O god-resembling Achilles,"
13659,(I. 121-218.),Thus to dissimulate and evade me with a profession;
13660,(I. 121-218.),"Is it that you desire to enjoy your prize, and to let me"
13661,(I. 121-218.),"Sit empty-handed here, and mine you bid me surrender—"
13662,(I. 121-218.),"Doubtless, if the noble Achæans find me another"
13663,(I. 121-218.),Suitable to my wants and answerable in value;
13664,(I. 121-218.),"But, if they do not give, myself will make my election—"
13665,(I. 121-218.),"Yours, or that, if I please, of Ajax or of Ulysses,"
13666,(I. 121-218.),"I for my own will take, and leave the loser lamenting."
13667,(I. 121-218.),"At a suitable time this, after, will we determine;"
13668,(I. 121-218.),"Now proceed we to haul a swift ship into the water,"
13669,(I. 121-218.),"Choose the rowers to take her, and send the cattle aboard her"
13670,(I. 121-218.),"For sacrifice, and bring the beautiful daughter of Chryses"
13671,(I. 121-218.),"Also on board, and appoint some prudent chief to convey her—"
13672,(I. 121-218.),"Ajax shall it be, or Idomeneus, or Ulysses?"
13673,(I. 121-218.),"Or will Pelides, incomparable of heroes,"
13674,(I. 121-218.),"Go, and with holy rite appease the wrath of Apollo?’"
13675,(I. 121-218.),"And with a frown swift-footed Achilles eyed him, and answered:"
13676,(I. 121-218.),"‘O me! clothed-upon with impudence, greedy-hearted,"
13677,(I. 121-218.),"How shall any Achæan again be willing to serve you,"
13678,(I. 121-218.),"Make any expedition, or fight in battle to help you?"
13679,(I. 121-218.),Certainly not upon any account of the Troïan horsemen
13680,(I. 121-218.),"Came I hither to fight; they never gave me occasion,"
13681,(I. 121-218.),"Never carried away any cattle of mine, any horses,"
13682,(I. 121-218.),"Nor in Phthia ever, the rich land, feeder of people,"
13683,(I. 121-218.),"Devastated the fruit; since numerous, to divide them,"
13684,(I. 121-218.),"Mountains shadowy lie, and a sea’s tumultuous water:"
13685,(I. 121-218.),"To’ attend thee we came, on thy effrontery waiting,"
13686,(I. 121-218.),"Reparation to take of the Trojans for Menelaus,"
13687,(I. 121-218.),"And thy unblushing self. All which you little remember,"
13688,(I. 121-218.),"And can threaten to-day of my reward to deprive me,"
13689,(I. 121-218.),"Dearly with labour earned, and given me by the Achæans."
13690,(I. 121-218.),"Do I ever receive any gift your gifts to compare with,"
13691,(I. 121-218.),When the Achæans sack any wealthy town of the Trojans?
13692,(I. 121-218.),"Truly the larger part of the busy, hurrying warfare"
13693,(I. 121-218.),"My hands have to discharge; but, in the day of division,"
13694,(I. 121-218.),"Yours is the ample share, and I, content with a little,"
13695,(I. 121-218.),"Thankfully turn to my ships, well wearied out with the fighting."
13696,(I. 121-218.),"Now to Phthia I go—far wiser for me to do so,"
13697,(I. 121-218.),"Home with my hollow ships to travel, than for another"
13698,(I. 121-218.),Accumulate riches to be requited with insult.’
13699,(I. 121-218.),"And replying, said the king of men, Agamemnon:"
13700,(I. 121-218.),"‘Go, if to go be your wish; I keep you not—do not ask you"
13701,(I. 121-218.),"For my honour to stay; I have others here to support it,"
13702,(I. 121-218.),"Who—and Zeus above all, the Counsellor—will uphold me"
13703,(I. 121-218.),"You are the hatefullest to me of the Zeus-fed princes,"
13704,(I. 121-218.),Lover for evermore of brawl and battle and discord.
13705,(I. 121-218.),"Strong if you are, your strength was by some deity given."
13706,(I. 121-218.),"Home with your hollow ships, and with your people returning"
13707,(I. 121-218.),"Order the Myrmidonans: expect not me to regard you,"
13708,(I. 121-218.),Or to observe your wrath. I advertise you beforehand—
13709,(I. 121-218.),"As Chryseïda Phœbus Apollo hath bid me surrender,"
13710,(I. 121-218.),I in a ship of my own will with my people remit her
13711,(I. 121-218.),"Home, and the beautiful-cheeked Briseïda then to replace her"
13712,(I. 121-218.),"Out of your tent, your prize, will carry; an argument to you"
13713,(I. 121-218.),"How much greater I am than yourself, and a warning to others"
13714,(I. 121-218.),Not to oppose my will and talk with me as an equal.’
13715,(I. 121-218.),"So said he, and pain seized Pelides, and in the bosom"
13716,(I. 121-218.),"Under his hairy breast two purposes he divided,"
13717,(I. 121-218.),"Either, from by his thigh the glittering blade unsheathing,"
13718,(I. 121-218.),"To put aside the rest and straightway kill Agamemnon,"
13719,(I. 121-218.),Or to repress his wrath and check himself in his anger.
13720,(I. 121-218.),"With the purposes yet conflicting thus in his bosom,"
13721,(I. 121-218.),"From the sheath the huge sword was issuing out, when Athena"
13722,(I. 121-218.),"Came from heaven: the goddess, the white-armed Hera, desired it,"
13723,(I. 121-218.),Solicitous for the good of the one alike and the other.
13724,(I. 121-218.),"Standing behind, by the yellow hair she drew back Achilles,"
13725,(I. 121-218.),"Visible only to him, of the rest to no one apparent;"
13726,(I. 121-218.),"And with wonder seized he turned, and knew in a moment"
13727,(I. 121-218.),"Pallas Athenæa, with dreadful eyes looking at him;"
13728,(I. 121-218.),And he opened his lips with wingèd words and addressed her:
13729,(I. 121-218.),"‘Wherefore art thou come, O child of the ægis-bearer;"
13730,(I. 121-218.),Was it the fury to see of Atrides Agamemnon?
13731,(I. 121-218.),"Lo, I declare it now, and you will see it accomplished,"
13732,(I. 121-218.),His injurious acts will bring his death-blow upon him.’
13733,(I. 121-218.),"And replying, said the blue-eyed goddess, Athena:"
13734,(I. 121-218.),"‘To repress I came, if practicable, your anger,"
13735,(I. 121-218.),"Out of heaven,—the goddess, the white-armed Hera, desired me,"
13736,(I. 121-218.),Solicitous for the good of the one alike and the other.
13737,(I. 121-218.),"Abstain from violence, put back the sword in the scabbard,"
13738,(I. 121-218.),"Let opprobrious words, if necessary, requite him;"
13739,(I. 121-218.),"For I declare it now, and you will see it accomplished,"
13740,(I. 121-218.),"Three times as many gifts will soon, as costly, be sent you"
13741,(I. 121-218.),In reparation of this; be ruled by us to be patient.’
13742,(I. 121-218.),"And replying, spoke and said swift-footed Achilles:"
13743,(I. 121-218.),"‘Unto admonition of you two given, O goddess,"
13744,(I. 121-218.),Even the greatly incensed should yield; ’tis well to obey you;
13745,(I. 121-218.),"Who to the voice of the gods is obedient, they will assist him.’"
