113,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,"_To those unacquainted with Tennyson's conscientious methods, it may"
114,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,seem strange that a volume of 160 pages is necessary to contain those
115,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,"poems written and published by him during his active literary career,"
116,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,and ultimately rejected as unsatisfactory. Of this considerable body
117,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,"of verse, a great part was written, not in youth or old age, but while"
118,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,Tennyson's powers were at their greatest. Whatever reasons may once
119,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,"have existed for suppressing the poems that follow, the student of"
120,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,English literature is entitled to demand that the whole body of
121,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,"Tennyson's work should now be open, without restriction or impediment,"
122,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,to the critical study to which the works of his compeers are
123,INDEX OF FIRST LINES,subjected._

156,--CHAPMAN.,
157,--CHAPMAN.,I stood upon the Mountain which o'erlooks
158,--CHAPMAN.,"The narrow seas, whose rapid interval"
159,--CHAPMAN.,"Parts Afric from green Europe, when the Sun"
160,--CHAPMAN.,"Had fall'n below th' Atlantick, and above"
161,--CHAPMAN.,"The silent Heavens were blench'd with faery light,"
162,--CHAPMAN.,"Uncertain whether faery light or cloud,"
163,--CHAPMAN.,"Flowing Southward, and the chasms of deep, deep blue"
164,--CHAPMAN.,"Slumber'd unfathomable, and the stars"
165,--CHAPMAN.,Were flooded over with clear glory and pale.
166,--CHAPMAN.,"I gaz'd upon the sheeny coast beyond,"
167,--CHAPMAN.,There where the Giant of old Time infixed
168,--CHAPMAN.,"The limits of his prowess, pillars high"
169,--CHAPMAN.,Long time eras'd from Earth: even as the sea
170,--CHAPMAN.,When weary of wild inroad buildeth up
171,--CHAPMAN.,Huge mounds whereby to stay his yeasty waves.
172,--CHAPMAN.,And much I mus'd on legends quaint and old
173,--CHAPMAN.,Which whilome won the hearts of all on Earth
174,--CHAPMAN.,"Toward their brightness, ev'n as flame draws air;"
175,--CHAPMAN.,But had their being in the heart of Man
176,--CHAPMAN.,As air is th' life of flame: and thou wert then
177,--CHAPMAN.,"A center'd glory-circled Memory,"
178,--CHAPMAN.,"Divinest Atalantis, whom the waves"
179,--CHAPMAN.,"Have buried deep, and thou of later name"
180,--CHAPMAN.,Imperial Eldorado root'd with gold:
181,--CHAPMAN.,"Shadows to which, despite all shocks of Change,"
182,--CHAPMAN.,"All on-set of capricious Accident,"
183,--CHAPMAN.,Men clung with yearning Hope which would not die.
184,--CHAPMAN.,As when in some great City where the walls
185,--CHAPMAN.,"Shake, and the streets with ghastly faces throng'd"
186,--CHAPMAN.,"Do utter forth a subterranean voice,"
187,--CHAPMAN.,Among the inner columns far retir'd
188,--CHAPMAN.,"At midnight, in the lone Acropolis."
189,--CHAPMAN.,Before the awful Genius of the place
190,--CHAPMAN.,"Kneels the pale Priestess in deep faith, the while"
191,--CHAPMAN.,Above her head the weak lamp dips and winks
192,--CHAPMAN.,Unto the fearful summoning without:
193,--CHAPMAN.,"Nathless she ever clasps the marble knees,"
194,--CHAPMAN.,"Bathes the cold hand with tears, and gazeth on"
195,--CHAPMAN.,Those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith
196,--CHAPMAN.,Her phantasy informs them.
197,--CHAPMAN.,
198,--CHAPMAN.,Where are ye
199,--CHAPMAN.,"Thrones of the Western wave, fair Islands green?"
200,--CHAPMAN.,"Where are your moonlight halls, your cedarn glooms,"
201,--CHAPMAN.,The blossoming abysses of your hills?
202,--CHAPMAN.,Your flowering Capes and your gold-sanded bays
203,--CHAPMAN.,Blown round with happy airs of odorous winds?
204,--CHAPMAN.,"Where are the infinite ways which, Seraphtrod,"
205,--CHAPMAN.,"Wound thro' your great Elysian solitudes,"
206,--CHAPMAN.,"Whose lowest depths were, as with visible love,"
207,--CHAPMAN.,"Fill'd with Divine effulgence, circumfus'd,"
208,--CHAPMAN.,"Flowing between the clear and polish'd stems,"
209,--CHAPMAN.,And ever circling round their emerald cones
210,--CHAPMAN.,"In coronals and glories, such as gird"
211,--CHAPMAN.,The unfading foreheads of the Saints in Heaven?
212,--CHAPMAN.,"For nothing visible, they say, had birth"
213,--CHAPMAN.,In that blest ground but it was play'd about
214,--CHAPMAN.,With its peculiar glory. Then I rais'd
215,--CHAPMAN.,"My voice and cried 'Wide Afric, doth thy Sun"
216,--CHAPMAN.,"Lighten, thy hills enfold a City as fair"
217,--CHAPMAN.,As those which starr'd the night o' the Elder World?
218,--CHAPMAN.,Or is the rumour of thy Timbuctoo
219,--CHAPMAN.,A dream as frail as those of ancient Time?'
220,--CHAPMAN.,
221,--CHAPMAN.,"A curve of whitening, flashing, ebbing light!"
222,--CHAPMAN.,A rustling of white wings! The bright descent
223,--CHAPMAN.,Of a young Seraph! and he stood beside me
224,--CHAPMAN.,"There on the ridge, and look'd into my face"
225,--CHAPMAN.,"With his unutterable, shining orbs,"
226,--CHAPMAN.,So that with hasty motion I did veil
227,--CHAPMAN.,"My vision with both hands, and saw before me"
228,--CHAPMAN.,Such colour'd spots as dance athwart the eyes
229,--CHAPMAN.,Of those that gaze upon the noonday Sun.
230,--CHAPMAN.,Girt with a Zone of flashing gold beneath
231,--CHAPMAN.,"His breast, and compass'd round about his brow"
232,--CHAPMAN.,"With triple arch of everchanging bows,"
233,--CHAPMAN.,And circled with the glory of living light
234,--CHAPMAN.,"And alternations of all hues, he stood."
235,--CHAPMAN.,"'O child of man, why muse you here alone"
236,--CHAPMAN.,"Upon the Mountain, on the dreams of old"
237,--CHAPMAN.,"Which fill'd the Earth with passing loveliness,"
238,--CHAPMAN.,"Which flung strange music on the howling winds,"
239,--CHAPMAN.,And odours rapt from remote Paradise?
240,--CHAPMAN.,"Thy sense is clogg'd with dull mortality,"
241,--CHAPMAN.,Thy spirit fetter'd with the bond of clay:
242,--CHAPMAN.,Open thine eye and see.'
243,--CHAPMAN.,
244,--CHAPMAN.,"I look'd, but not"
245,--CHAPMAN.,"Upon his face, for it was wonderful"
246,--CHAPMAN.,"With its exceeding brightness, and the light"
247,--CHAPMAN.,Of the great angel mind which look'd from out
248,--CHAPMAN.,The starry glowing of his restless eyes.
249,--CHAPMAN.,"I felt my soul grow mighty, and my spirit"
250,--CHAPMAN.,With supernatural excitation bound
251,--CHAPMAN.,"Within me, and my mental eye grew large"
252,--CHAPMAN.,"With such a vast circumference of thought,"
253,--CHAPMAN.,That in my vanity I seem'd to stand
254,--CHAPMAN.,Upon the outward verge and bound alone
255,--CHAPMAN.,Of full beatitude. Each failing sense
256,--CHAPMAN.,As with a momentary flash of light
257,--CHAPMAN.,Grew thrillingly distinct and keen. I saw
258,--CHAPMAN.,"The smallest grain that dappled the dark Earth,"
259,--CHAPMAN.,"The indistinctest atom in deep air,"
260,--CHAPMAN.,"The Moon's white cities, and the opal width"
261,--CHAPMAN.,"Of her small glowing lakes, her silver heights"
262,--CHAPMAN.,"Unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud,"
263,--CHAPMAN.,"And the unsounded, undescended depth"
264,--CHAPMAN.,Of her black hollows. The clear Galaxy
265,--CHAPMAN.,"Shorn of its hoary lustre, wonderful,"
266,--CHAPMAN.,Distinct and vivid with sharp points of light
267,--CHAPMAN.,"Blaze within blaze, an unimagin'd depth"
268,--CHAPMAN.,And harmony of planet-girded Suns
269,--CHAPMAN.,"And moon-encircled planets, wheel in wheel,"
270,--CHAPMAN.,"Arch'd the wan Sapphire. Nay, the hum of men,"
271,--CHAPMAN.,"Or other things talking in unknown tongues,"
272,--CHAPMAN.,And notes of busy life in distant worlds
273,--CHAPMAN.,Beat like a far wave on my anxious ear.
274,--CHAPMAN.,
275,--CHAPMAN.,"A maze of piercing, trackless, thrilling thoughts"
276,--CHAPMAN.,Involving and embracing each with each
277,--CHAPMAN.,"Rapid as fire, inextricably link'd,"
278,--CHAPMAN.,Expanding momently with every sight
279,--CHAPMAN.,"And sound which struck the palpitating sense,"
280,--CHAPMAN.,"The issue of strong impulse, hurried through"
281,--CHAPMAN.,The riv'n rapt brain: as when in some large lake
282,--CHAPMAN.,"From pressure of descendant crags, which lapse"
283,--CHAPMAN.,"Disjointed, crumbling from their parent slope"
284,--CHAPMAN.,"At slender interval, the level calm"
285,--CHAPMAN.,Is ridg'd with restless and increasing spheres
286,--CHAPMAN.,"Which break upon each other, each th' effect"
287,--CHAPMAN.,"Of separate impulse, but more fleet and strong"
288,--CHAPMAN.,"Than its precursor, till the eyes in vain"
289,--CHAPMAN.,Amid the wild unrest of swimming shade
290,--CHAPMAN.,Dappled with hollow and alternate rise
291,--CHAPMAN.,"Of interpenetrated arc, would scan"
292,--CHAPMAN.,Definite round.
293,--CHAPMAN.,I know not if I shape
294,--CHAPMAN.,These things with accurate similitude
295,--CHAPMAN.,"From visible objects, for but dimly now,"
296,--CHAPMAN.,"Less vivid than a half-forgotten dream,"
297,--CHAPMAN.,The memory of that mental excellence
298,--CHAPMAN.,"Comes o'er me, and it may be I entwine"
299,--CHAPMAN.,The indecision of my present mind
300,--CHAPMAN.,"With its past clearness, yet it seems to me"
301,--CHAPMAN.,As even then the torrent of quick thought
302,--CHAPMAN.,Absorbed me from the nature of itself
303,--CHAPMAN.,"With its own fleetness. Where is he that, borne"
304,--CHAPMAN.,"Adown the sloping of an arrowy stream,"
305,--CHAPMAN.,"Could link his shallop to the fleeting edge,"
306,--CHAPMAN.,And muse midway with philosophic calm
307,--CHAPMAN.,Upon the wondrous laws which regulate
308,--CHAPMAN.,The fierceness of the bounding element?
309,--CHAPMAN.,My thoughts which long had grovell'd in the slime
310,--CHAPMAN.,"Of this dull world, like dusky worms which house"
311,--CHAPMAN.,"Beneath unshaken waters, but at once"
312,--CHAPMAN.,Upon some earth-awakening day of spring
313,--CHAPMAN.,"Do pass from gloom to glory, and aloft"
314,--CHAPMAN.,"Winnow the purple, bearing on both sides"
315,--CHAPMAN.,Double display of starlit wings which burn
316,--CHAPMAN.,"Fanlike and fibred, with intensest bloom:"
317,--CHAPMAN.,"E'en so my thoughts, erewhile so low, now felt"
318,--CHAPMAN.,Unutterable buoyancy and strength
319,--CHAPMAN.,To bear them upward through the trackless fields
320,--CHAPMAN.,Of undefin'd existence far and free.
321,--CHAPMAN.,
322,--CHAPMAN.,Then first within the South methought I saw
323,--CHAPMAN.,"A wilderness of spires, and chrystal pile"
324,--CHAPMAN.,"Of rampart upon rampart, dome on dome,"
325,--CHAPMAN.,Illimitable range of battlement
326,--CHAPMAN.,"On battlement, and the Imperial height"
327,--CHAPMAN.,Of Canopy o'ercanopied.
328,--CHAPMAN.,"Behind,"
329,--CHAPMAN.,"In diamond light, upsprung the dazzling Cones"
330,--CHAPMAN.,"Of Pyramids, as far surpassing Earth's"
331,--CHAPMAN.,As Heaven than Earth is fairer. Each aloft
332,--CHAPMAN.,Upon his renown'd Eminence bore globes
333,--CHAPMAN.,"Of wheeling suns, or stars, or semblances"
334,--CHAPMAN.,"Of either, showering circular abyss"
335,--CHAPMAN.,Of radiance. But the glory of the place
336,--CHAPMAN.,Stood out a pillar'd front of burnish'd gold
337,--CHAPMAN.,"Interminably high, if gold it were"
338,--CHAPMAN.,"Or metal more ethereal, and beneath"
339,--CHAPMAN.,"Two doors of blinding brilliance, where no gaze"
340,--CHAPMAN.,"Might rest, stood open, and the eye could scan"
341,--CHAPMAN.,Through length of porch and lake and boundless
342,--CHAPMAN.,"hall,"
343,--CHAPMAN.,"Part of a throne of fiery flame, wherefrom"
344,--CHAPMAN.,"The snowy skirting of a garment hung,"
345,--CHAPMAN.,And glimpse of multitudes of multitudes
346,--CHAPMAN.,That minister'd around it--if I saw
347,--CHAPMAN.,"These things distinctly, for my human brain"
348,--CHAPMAN.,"Stagger'd beneath the vision, and thick night"
349,--CHAPMAN.,"Came down upon my eyelids, and I fell."
350,--CHAPMAN.,
351,--CHAPMAN.,With ministering hand he rais'd me up;
352,--CHAPMAN.,"Then with a mournful and ineffable smile,"
353,--CHAPMAN.,Which but to look on for a moment fill'd
354,--CHAPMAN.,"My eyes with irresistible sweet tears,"
355,--CHAPMAN.,"In accents of majestic melody,"
356,--CHAPMAN.,Like a swol'n river's gushings in still night
357,--CHAPMAN.,"Mingled with floating music, thus he spake:"
358,--CHAPMAN.,'There is no mightier Spirit than I to sway
359,--CHAPMAN.,The heart of man: and teach him to attain
360,--CHAPMAN.,By shadowing forth the Unattainable;
361,--CHAPMAN.,And step by step to scale that mighty stair
362,--CHAPMAN.,Whose landing-place is wrapt about with clouds
363,--CHAPMAN.,"Of glory of Heaven.[B] With earliest Light of Spring,"
364,--CHAPMAN.,"And in the glow of sallow Summertide,"
365,--CHAPMAN.,And in red Autumn when the winds are wild
366,--CHAPMAN.,"With gambols, and when full-voiced Winter roofs"
367,--CHAPMAN.,"The headland with inviolate white snow,"
368,--CHAPMAN.,"I play about his heart a thousand ways,"
369,--CHAPMAN.,"Visit his eyes with visions, and his ears"
370,--CHAPMAN.,With harmonies of wind and wave and wood
371,--CHAPMAN.,"--Of winds which tell of waters, and of waters"
372,--CHAPMAN.,Betraying the close kisses of the wind--
373,--CHAPMAN.,And win him unto me: and few there be
374,--CHAPMAN.,So gross of heart who have not felt and known
375,--CHAPMAN.,A higher than they see: They with dim eyes
376,--CHAPMAN.,Behold me darkling. Lo! I have given _thee_
377,--CHAPMAN.,"To understand my presence, and to feel"
378,--CHAPMAN.,My fullness; I have fill'd thy lips with power.
379,--CHAPMAN.,"I have rais'd thee higher to the Spheres of Heaven,"
380,--CHAPMAN.,"Man's first, last home: and thou with ravish'd sense"
381,--CHAPMAN.,Listenest the lordly music flowing from
382,--CHAPMAN.,"Th' illimitable years. I am the Spirit,"
383,--CHAPMAN.,The permeating life which courseth through
384,--CHAPMAN.,All th' intricate and labyrinthine veins
385,--CHAPMAN.,"Of the great vine of _Fable_, which, outspread"
386,--CHAPMAN.,"With growth of shadowing leaf and clusters rare,"
387,--CHAPMAN.,"Reacheth to every corner under Heaven,"
388,--CHAPMAN.,Deep-rooted in the living soil of truth:
389,--CHAPMAN.,So that men's hopes and fears take refuge in
390,--CHAPMAN.,The fragrance of its complicated glooms
391,--CHAPMAN.,"And cool impleachèd twilights. Child of Man,"
392,--CHAPMAN.,"See'st thou yon river, whose translucent wave,"
393,--CHAPMAN.,"Forth issuing from darkness, windeth through"
394,--CHAPMAN.,"The argent streets o' the City, imaging"
395,--CHAPMAN.,The soft inversion of her tremulous Domes;
396,--CHAPMAN.,"Her gardens frequent with the stately Palm,"
397,--CHAPMAN.,Her Pagods hung with music of sweet bells:
398,--CHAPMAN.,"Her obelisks of rangèd Chrysolite,"
399,--CHAPMAN.,"Minarets and towers? Lo! how he passeth by,"
400,--CHAPMAN.,"And gulphs himself in sands, as not enduring"
401,--CHAPMAN.,"To carry through the world those waves, which bore"
402,--CHAPMAN.,The reflex of my City in their depths.
403,--CHAPMAN.,Oh City! Oh latest Throne! where I was rais'd
404,--CHAPMAN.,To be a mystery of loveliness
405,--CHAPMAN.,"Unto all eyes, the time is well nigh come"
406,--CHAPMAN.,When I must render up this glorious home

422,--CHAPMAN.,us for a considerable period after the great generation of poets which
423,--CHAPMAN.,"is now passing away. The age seems determined to contradict us, and"
424,--CHAPMAN.,that in the most decided manner; for it has put forth poetry by a
425,--CHAPMAN.,"young man, and that where we should least expect it--namely, in a"
426,--CHAPMAN.,prize poem. These productions have often been ingenious and elegant
427,--CHAPMAN.,but we have never before seen one of them which indicated really
428,--CHAPMAN.,"first-rate poetical genius, and which would have done honour to any"
429,--CHAPMAN.,"men that ever wrote. Such, we do not hesitate to affirm, is the little"

431,--CHAPMAN.,"for they have assigned the prize to the author, though the measure in"
432,--CHAPMAN.,"which he writes was never before, we believe, thus selected for"

1934,XLI,
1935,XLI,"[There was published in 1837 in _The Tribute_, (a collection of"
1936,XLI,"original poems by various authors, edited by Lord Northampton), a"
1937,XLI,"contribution by Tennyson entitled 'Stanzas,' consisting of xvi stanzas"
1938,XLI,of varying lengths (110 lines in all). In 1855 the first xii stanzas
1939,XLI,were published as the fourth section of the second part of 'Maud.'
1940,XLI,Some verbal changes and transpositions of lines were made; a new
1941,XLI,"stanza (the present sixth) and several new lines were introduced, and"
1942,XLI,the xth stanza of 1837 became the xiiith of 1855. But stanzas xiii-xvi
1943,XLI,"of 1837 have never been reprinted in any edition of Tennyson's works,"
1944,XLI,though quoted in whole or part in various critical studies of the
1945,XLI,poet. Swinburne refers to this poem as 'the poem of deepest charm and
1946,XLI,"fullest delight of pathos and melody ever written, even by Mr"
1947,XLI,Tennyson.' This poem in _The Tribute_ gained Tennyson his first notice
1948,XLI,"in the _Edinburgh Review_, which had till then ignored him.]"

2044,XLIV,"satirical poem 'New Timon: a Romance of London,' in which he bitterly"
2045,XLIV,attacked Tennyson for the civil list pension granted the previous
2046,XLIV,"year, particularly referring to the poem 'O Darling Room' in the 1833"
2047,XLIV,"volume. Tennyson replied in the following vigorous verses, which made"
2048,XLIV,the literary sensation of the year. Tennyson afterwards declared: 'I
2049,XLIV,never sent my lines to _Punch_. John Forster did. They were too
2050,XLIV,bitter. I do not think that I should ever have published
2051,XLIV,"them.'--_Life_, vol. I, p. 245.]"

2056,XLIV,"That, strongly loathing, greatly broke."
2057,XLIV,
2058,XLIV,So died the Old: here comes the New:
2059,XLIV,Regard him: a familiar face:

2062,XLIV,
2063,XLIV,Who killed the girls and thrill'd the boys
2064,XLIV,"With dandy pathos when you wrote,"
2065,XLIV,"A Lion, you, that made a noise,"
2066,XLIV,And shook a mane en papillotes.
2067,XLIV,
2068,XLIV,And once you tried the Muses too:
2069,XLIV,"You fail'd, Sir: therefore now you turn,"
2070,XLIV,You fall on those who are to you
2071,XLIV,As captain is to subaltern.
2072,XLIV,
2073,XLIV,"But men of long enduring hopes,"
2074,XLIV,"And careless what this hour may bring,"

2081,XLIV,Is more than all poetic fame.
2082,XLIV,
2083,XLIV,"But you, Sir, you are hard to please;"

2087,XLIV,

2586,LIII,"form part of his 1833 volume. It was put in type and, according to"
2587,LIII,"custom, copies were distributed among his friends, when, on the eve of"
2588,LIII,"publication, he decided to omit it. Again, in 1869, it was sent to"

2590,LIII,"part only--'The Golden Supper,' founded on a story in Boccaccio's"
2591,LIII,"_Decameron_--being published in the volume, 'The Holy Grail.' In 1866,"
2592,LIII,"1870 and 1875, attempts had been made by Mr Herne Shepherd to publish"
2593,LIII,"editions of 'The Lover's Tale,' reprinted from stray proof copies of"
2594,LIII,"the 1833 printing. Each of these attempts was repressed by Tennyson,"
2595,LIII,"and at last in 1879 the complete poem, as now included in the"
2596,LIII,"collected Works, was issued, with an apologetic reference to the"
2597,LIII,necessity of reprinting the poem to prevent its circulation in an
2598,LIII,unauthorised form. But the 1879 issue is considerably altered from the
2599,LIII,"original issue of 1833, as written by Tennyson in his nineteenth year."

2606,A FRAGMENT,The Poem of the Lover's Tale (the lover is supposed to be himself a
2607,A FRAGMENT,"poet) was written in my nineteenth year, and consequently contains"
2608,A FRAGMENT,nearly as many faults as words. That I deemed it not wholly unoriginal
2609,A FRAGMENT,"is my only apology for its publication--an apology lame and poor, and"
2610,A FRAGMENT,somewhat impertinent to boot: so that if its infirmities meet with
2611,A FRAGMENT,"more laughter than charity in the world, I shall not raise my voice in"
2612,A FRAGMENT,"its defence. I am aware how deficient the Poem is in point of art, and"
2613,A FRAGMENT,it is not without considerable misgivings that I have ventured to
2614,A FRAGMENT,"publish even this fragment of it. 'Enough,' says the old proverb, 'is"

2680,A FRAGMENT,Eye feeding upon eye with deep intent;

2684,A FRAGMENT,"To worship mine own image, laved in light,"

2686,A FRAGMENT,"Of such a shrine--mine image in her eyes,"
2687,A FRAGMENT,"By diminution made most glorious,"
2688,A FRAGMENT,"Moved with their motions, as those eyes were moved"
2689,A FRAGMENT,"With motions of the soul, as my heart beat"

2752,A FRAGMENT,The beautiful in Past of act or place.
2753,A FRAGMENT,"Even as the all-enduring camel, driven"
2754,A FRAGMENT,"Far from the diamond fountain by the palms,"
2755,A FRAGMENT,"Toils onward thro' the middle moonlight nights,"
2756,A FRAGMENT,"Shadow'd and crimson'd with the drifting dust,"
2757,A FRAGMENT,Or when the white heats of the blinding noons
2758,A FRAGMENT,Beat from the concave sand; yet in him keeps
2759,A FRAGMENT,"A draught of that sweet fountain that he loves,"
2760,A FRAGMENT,"To stay his feet from falling, and his spirit"
2761,A FRAGMENT,From bitterness of death.
2762,A FRAGMENT,
2763,A FRAGMENT,"Ye ask me, friends,"
2764,A FRAGMENT,When I began to love. How should I tell ye?
2765,A FRAGMENT,"Or from the after fulness of my heart,"
2766,A FRAGMENT,Flow back again unto my slender spring
2767,A FRAGMENT,"And first of love, tho' every turn and depth"
2768,A FRAGMENT,Between is clearer in my life than all
2769,A FRAGMENT,Its present flow. Ye know not what ye ask.
2770,A FRAGMENT,How should the broad and open flower tell
2771,A FRAGMENT,"What sort of bud it was, when press'd together"
2772,A FRAGMENT,"In its green sheath, close lapt in silken folds?"
2773,A FRAGMENT,"It seemed to keep its sweetness to itself,"
2774,A FRAGMENT,Yet was not the less sweet for that it seem'd.
2775,A FRAGMENT,"For young Life knows not when young Life was born,"
2776,A FRAGMENT,"But takes it all for granted: neither Love,"
2777,A FRAGMENT,"Warm in the heart, his cradle can remember"
2778,A FRAGMENT,"Love in the womb, but resteth satisfied,"
2779,A FRAGMENT,Looking on her that brought him to the light:
2780,A FRAGMENT,Or as men know not when they fall asleep
2781,A FRAGMENT,"Into delicious dreams, our other life,"
2782,A FRAGMENT,So know I not when I began to love.
2783,A FRAGMENT,This is my sum of knowledge--that my love
2784,A FRAGMENT,"Grew with myself--and say rather, was my growth,"
2785,A FRAGMENT,"My inward sap, the hold I have on earth,"
2786,A FRAGMENT,"My outward circling air wherein I breathe,"
2787,A FRAGMENT,"Which yet upholds my life, and evermore"
2788,A FRAGMENT,Was to me daily life and daily death:
2789,A FRAGMENT,For how should I have lived and not have loved?
2790,A FRAGMENT,"Can ye take off the sweetness from the flower,"
2791,A FRAGMENT,"The colour and the sweetness from the rose,"
2792,A FRAGMENT,And place them by themselves? or set apart
2793,A FRAGMENT,"Their motions and their brightness from the stars,"
2794,A FRAGMENT,And then point out the flower or the star?
2795,A FRAGMENT,"Or build a wall betwixt my life and love,"
2796,A FRAGMENT,And tell me where I am? 'Tis even thus:
2797,A FRAGMENT,In that I live I love; because I love
2798,A FRAGMENT,I live: whate'er is fountain to the one
2799,A FRAGMENT,Is fountain to the other; and whene'er
2800,A FRAGMENT,"Our God unknits the riddle of the one,"
2801,A FRAGMENT,There is no shade or fold of mystery
2802,A FRAGMENT,Swathing the other.
2803,A FRAGMENT,
2804,A FRAGMENT,"Many, many years,"
2805,A FRAGMENT,"For they seem many and my most of life,"
2806,A FRAGMENT,"And well I could have linger'd in that porch,"
2807,A FRAGMENT,"So unproportioned to the dwelling place,"
2808,A FRAGMENT,"In the maydews of childhood, opposite"
2809,A FRAGMENT,"The flush and dawn of youth, we lived together,"
2810,A FRAGMENT,"Apart, alone together on those hills."
2811,A FRAGMENT,"Before he saw my day my father died,"
2812,A FRAGMENT,And he was happy that he saw it not:
2813,A FRAGMENT,But I and the first daisy on his grave
2814,A FRAGMENT,From the same clay came into light at once.
2815,A FRAGMENT,As Love and I do number equal years
2816,A FRAGMENT,"So she, my love, is of an age with me."
2817,A FRAGMENT,How like each other was the birth of each!
2818,A FRAGMENT,The sister of my mother--she that bore
2819,A FRAGMENT,"Camilla close beneath her beating heart,"
2820,A FRAGMENT,"Which to the imprisoned spirit of the child,"
2821,A FRAGMENT,With its true touched pulses in the flow
2822,A FRAGMENT,"And hourly visitation of the blood,"
2823,A FRAGMENT,"Sent notes of preparation manifold,"
2824,A FRAGMENT,And mellow'd echoes of the outer world--
2825,A FRAGMENT,"My mother's sister, mother of my love,"
2826,A FRAGMENT,"Who had a twofold claim upon my heart,"
2827,A FRAGMENT,"One twofold mightier than the other was,"
2828,A FRAGMENT,"In giving so much beauty to the world,"
2829,A FRAGMENT,"And so much wealth as God had charged her with,"
2830,A FRAGMENT,"Loathing to put it from herself for ever,"
2831,A FRAGMENT,Crown'd with her highest act the placid face
2832,A FRAGMENT,And breathless body of her good deeds past.
2833,A FRAGMENT,"So we were born, so orphan'd. She was motherless,"
2834,A FRAGMENT,And I without a father. So from each
2835,A FRAGMENT,Of those two pillars which from earth uphold
2836,A FRAGMENT,"Our childhood, one had fall'n away, and all"
2837,A FRAGMENT,The careful burthen of our tender years
2838,A FRAGMENT,Trembled upon the other. He that gave
2839,A FRAGMENT,"Her life, to me delightedly fulfill'd"
2840,A FRAGMENT,"All loving-kindnesses, all offices"
2841,A FRAGMENT,Of watchful care and trembling tenderness.
2842,A FRAGMENT,He worked for both: he pray'd for both: he slept
2843,A FRAGMENT,Dreaming of both; nor was his love the less
2844,A FRAGMENT,"Because it was divided, and shot forth"
2845,A FRAGMENT,"Boughs on each side, laden with wholesome shade,"
2846,A FRAGMENT,"Wherein we rested sleeping or awake,"
2847,A FRAGMENT,And sung aloud the matin-song of life.
2848,A FRAGMENT,
2849,A FRAGMENT,She was my foster-sister: on one arm
2850,A FRAGMENT,The flaxen ringlets of our infancies
2851,A FRAGMENT,"Wander'd, the while we rested: one soft lap"
2852,A FRAGMENT,Pillow'd us both: one common light of eyes
2853,A FRAGMENT,"Was on us as we lay: our baby lips,"
2854,A FRAGMENT,"Kissing one bosom, ever drew from thence"
2855,A FRAGMENT,"The stream of life, one stream, one life, one blood,"
2856,A FRAGMENT,"One sustenance, which, still as thought grew large,"
2857,A FRAGMENT,"Still larger moulding all the house of thought,"
2858,A FRAGMENT,Perchance assimilated all our tastes
2859,A FRAGMENT,And future fancies. 'Tis a beautiful
2860,A FRAGMENT,"And pleasant meditation, what whate'er"
2861,A FRAGMENT,"Our general mother meant for me alone,"
2862,A FRAGMENT,Our mutual mother dealt to both of us:
2863,A FRAGMENT,"So what was earliest mine in earliest life,"
2864,A FRAGMENT,I shared with her in whom myself remains.
2865,A FRAGMENT,"As was our childhood, so our infancy,"
2866,A FRAGMENT,"They tell me, was a very miracle"
2867,A FRAGMENT,Of fellow-feeling and communion.
2868,A FRAGMENT,"They tell me that we would not be alone,--"
2869,A FRAGMENT,"We cried when we were parted; when I wept,"
2870,A FRAGMENT,"Her smile lit up the rainbow on my tears,"
2871,A FRAGMENT,Stay'd on the clouds of sorrow; that we loved
2872,A FRAGMENT,The sound of one another's voices more
2873,A FRAGMENT,"Than the grey cuckoo loves his name, and learn'd"
2874,A FRAGMENT,To lisp in tune together; that we slept
2875,A FRAGMENT,"In the same cradle always, face to face,"
2876,A FRAGMENT,"Heart beating time to heart, lip pressing lip,"
2877,A FRAGMENT,"Folding each other, breathing on each other,"
2878,A FRAGMENT,Dreaming together (dreaming of each other
2879,A FRAGMENT,They should have added) till the morning light
2880,A FRAGMENT,"Sloped thro' the pines, upon the dewy pane"
2881,A FRAGMENT,"Falling, unseal'd our eyelids, and we woke"
2882,A FRAGMENT,"To gaze upon each other. If this be true,"
2883,A FRAGMENT,At thought of which my whole soul languishes
2884,A FRAGMENT,"And faints, and hath no pulse, no breath, as tho'"
2885,A FRAGMENT,A man in some still garden should infuse
2886,A FRAGMENT,"Rich attar in the bosom of the rose,"
2887,A FRAGMENT,"Till, drunk with its own wine and overfull"
2888,A FRAGMENT,"Of sweetness, and in smelling of itself,"
2889,A FRAGMENT,It fall on its own thorns--if this be true--
2890,A FRAGMENT,And that way my wish leaneth evermore
2891,A FRAGMENT,"Still to believe it--'tis so sweet a thought,"
2892,A FRAGMENT,Why in the utter stillness of the soul
2893,A FRAGMENT,"Doth question'd memory answer not, nor tell,"
2894,A FRAGMENT,"Of this our earliest, our closest drawn,"
2895,A FRAGMENT,"Most loveliest, most delicious union?"
2896,A FRAGMENT,"Oh, happy, happy outset of my days!"
2897,A FRAGMENT,"Green springtide, April promise, glad new year"
2898,A FRAGMENT,"Of Being, which with earliest violets,"
2899,A FRAGMENT,"And lavish carol of clear-throated larks,"
2900,A FRAGMENT,Fill'd all the march of life.--I will not speak of thee;
2901,A FRAGMENT,"These have not seen thee, these can never know thee,"
2902,A FRAGMENT,They cannot understand me. Pass on then
2903,A FRAGMENT,A term of eighteen years. Ye would but laugh
2904,A FRAGMENT,If I should tell ye how I heard in thought
2905,A FRAGMENT,"Those rhymes, 'The Lion and the Unicorn'"
2906,A FRAGMENT,"'The Four-and-twenty Blackbirds' 'Banbury Cross,'"
2907,A FRAGMENT,"'The Gander' and 'The man of Mitylene,'"
2908,A FRAGMENT,"And all the quaint old scraps of ancient crones,"
2909,A FRAGMENT,"Which are as gems set in my memory,"
2910,A FRAGMENT,Because she learn'd them with me. Or what profits it
2911,A FRAGMENT,"To tell ye that her father died, just ere"
2912,A FRAGMENT,The daffodil was blown; or how we found
2913,A FRAGMENT,The drowned seaman on the shore? These things
2914,A FRAGMENT,Unto the quiet daylight of your minds
2915,A FRAGMENT,"Are cloud and smoke, but in the dark of mine"
2916,A FRAGMENT,"Show traced with flame. Move with me to that hour,"
2917,A FRAGMENT,"Which was the hinge on which the door of Hope,"
2918,A FRAGMENT,"Once turning, open'd far into the outward,"
2919,A FRAGMENT,And never closed again.
2920,A FRAGMENT,
2921,A FRAGMENT,"I well remember,"
2922,A FRAGMENT,"It was a glorious morning, such a one"
2923,A FRAGMENT,As dawns but once a season. Mercury
2924,A FRAGMENT,On such a morning would have flung himself
2925,A FRAGMENT,"From cloud to cloud, and swum with balanced wings"
2926,A FRAGMENT,To some tall mountain. On that day the year
2927,A FRAGMENT,"First felt his youth and strength, and from his spring"
2928,A FRAGMENT,"Moved smiling toward his summer. On that day,"
2929,A FRAGMENT,Love working shook his wings (that charged the winds
2930,A FRAGMENT,With spiced May-sweets from bound to bound) and blew
2931,A FRAGMENT,"Fresh fire into the sun, and from within"
2932,A FRAGMENT,"Burst thro' the heated buds, and sent his soul"
2933,A FRAGMENT,"Into the songs of birds, and touch'd far-off"
2934,A FRAGMENT,"His mountain-altars, his high hills, with flame"
2935,A FRAGMENT,Milder and purer. Up the rocks we wound;
2936,A FRAGMENT,"The great pine shook with lovely sounds of joy,"
2937,A FRAGMENT,That came on the sea-wind. As mountain brooks
2938,A FRAGMENT,Our blood ran free: the sunshine seem'd to brood
2939,A FRAGMENT,More warmly on the heart than on the brow.
2940,A FRAGMENT,"We often paused, and looking back, we saw"
2941,A FRAGMENT,The clefts and openings in the hills all fill'd
2942,A FRAGMENT,"With the blue valley and the glistening brooks,"
2943,A FRAGMENT,And with the low dark groves--a land of Love;
2944,A FRAGMENT,"Where Love was worshipp'd upon every height,"
2945,A FRAGMENT,Where Love was worshipp'd under every tree--
2946,A FRAGMENT,"A land of promise, flowing with the milk"
2947,A FRAGMENT,And honey of delicious memories
2948,A FRAGMENT,"Down to the sea, as far as eye could ken,"
2949,A FRAGMENT,"From verge to verge it was a holy land,"
2950,A FRAGMENT,"Still growing holier as you near'd the bay,"
2951,A FRAGMENT,For where the temple stood. When we had reach'd
2952,A FRAGMENT,"The grassy platform on some hill, I stoop'd,"
2953,A FRAGMENT,"I gather'd the wild herbs, and for her brows"
2954,A FRAGMENT,"And mine wove chaplets of the self-same flower,"
2955,A FRAGMENT,"Which she took smiling, and with my work there"
2956,A FRAGMENT,Crown'd her clear forehead. Once or twice she told me
2957,A FRAGMENT,"(For I remember all things), to let grow"
2958,A FRAGMENT,The flowers that run poison in their veins.
2959,A FRAGMENT,"She said, 'The evil flourish in the world';"
2960,A FRAGMENT,Then playfully she gave herself the lie:
2961,A FRAGMENT,"'Nothing in nature is unbeautiful,"
2962,A FRAGMENT,"So, brother, pluck and spare not.' So I wove"
2963,A FRAGMENT,"Even the dull-blooded poppy, 'whose red flower"
2964,A FRAGMENT,"Hued with the scarlet of a fierce sunrise,"
2965,A FRAGMENT,"Like to the wild youth of an evil king,"
2966,A FRAGMENT,"Is without sweetness, but who crowns himself"
2967,A FRAGMENT,Above the secret poisons of his heart
2968,A FRAGMENT,In his old age'--a graceful thought of hers
2969,A FRAGMENT,"Graven on my fancy! As I said, with these"
2970,A FRAGMENT,"She crown'd her forehead. O how like a nymph,"
2971,A FRAGMENT,"A stately mountain-nymph, she look'd! how native"
2972,A FRAGMENT,Unto the hills she trod on! What an angel!
2973,A FRAGMENT,"How clothed with beams! My eyes, fix'd upon hers,"
2974,A FRAGMENT,Almost forgot even to move again.
2975,A FRAGMENT,My spirit leap'd as with those thrills of bliss
2976,A FRAGMENT,"That shoot across the soul in prayer, and show us"
2977,A FRAGMENT,That we are surely heard. Methought a light
2978,A FRAGMENT,"Burst from the garland I had woven, and stood"
2979,A FRAGMENT,A solid glory on her bright black hair:
2980,A FRAGMENT,"A light, methought, broke from her dark, dark eyes,"
2981,A FRAGMENT,And shot itself into the singing winds;
2982,A FRAGMENT,"A light, methought, flash'd even from her white robe,"
2983,A FRAGMENT,"As from a glass in the sun, and fell about"
2984,A FRAGMENT,My footsteps on the mountains.
2985,A FRAGMENT,
2986,A FRAGMENT,About sunset
2987,A FRAGMENT,"We came unto the hill of woe, so call'd"
2988,A FRAGMENT,"Because the legend ran that, long time since,"
2989,A FRAGMENT,"One rainy night, when every wind blew loud,"
2990,A FRAGMENT,A woful man had thrust his wife and child
2991,A FRAGMENT,"With shouts from off the bridge, and following, plunged"
2992,A FRAGMENT,"Into the dizzy chasm below. Below,"
2993,A FRAGMENT,Sheer thro' the black-wall'd cliff the rapid brook
2994,A FRAGMENT,"Shot down his inner thunders, built above"
2995,A FRAGMENT,With matted bramble and the shining gloss
2996,A FRAGMENT,"Of ivy-leaves, whose low-hung tresses, dipp'd"
2997,A FRAGMENT,"In the fierce stream, bore downward with the wave."
2998,A FRAGMENT,The path was steep and loosely strewn with crags
2999,A FRAGMENT,We mounted slowly: yet to both of us
3000,A FRAGMENT,"It was delight, not hindrance: unto both"
3001,A FRAGMENT,"Delight from hardship to be overcome,"
3002,A FRAGMENT,And scorn of perilous seeming: unto me
3003,A FRAGMENT,"Intense delight and rapture that I breathed,"
3004,A FRAGMENT,"As with a sense of nigher Deity,"
3005,A FRAGMENT,With her to whom all outward fairest things
3006,A FRAGMENT,"Were by the busy mind referr'd, compared,"
3007,A FRAGMENT,As bearing no essential fruits of excellence.
3008,A FRAGMENT,Save as they were the types and shadowings
3009,A FRAGMENT,Of hers--and then that I became to her
3010,A FRAGMENT,"A tutelary angel as she rose,"
3011,A FRAGMENT,And with a fearful self-impelling joy
3012,A FRAGMENT,"Saw round her feet the country far away,"
3013,A FRAGMENT,"Beyond the nearest mountain's bosky brows,"
3014,A FRAGMENT,"Burst into open prospect--heath and hill,"
3015,A FRAGMENT,And hollow lined and wooded to the lips--
3016,A FRAGMENT,And steep down walls of battlemented rock
3017,A FRAGMENT,Girded with broom or shiver'd into peaks--
3018,A FRAGMENT,"And glory of broad waters interfused,"
3019,A FRAGMENT,Whence rose as it were breath and steam of gold;
3020,A FRAGMENT,And over all the great wood rioting
3021,A FRAGMENT,"And climbing, starr'd at slender intervals"
3022,A FRAGMENT,"With blossom tufts of purest white; and last,"
3023,A FRAGMENT,"Framing the mighty landskip to the West,"
3024,A FRAGMENT,"A purple range of purple cones, between"
3025,A FRAGMENT,"Whose interspaces gush'd, in blinding bursts,"
3026,A FRAGMENT,The incorporate light of sun and sea.
3027,A FRAGMENT,
3028,A FRAGMENT,"At length,"
3029,A FRAGMENT,"Upon the tremulous bridge, that from beneath"
3030,A FRAGMENT,Seemed with a cobweb firmament to link
3031,A FRAGMENT,"The earthquake-shattered chasm, hung with shrubs,"
3032,A FRAGMENT,"We passed with tears of rapture. All the West,"
3033,A FRAGMENT,"And even unto the middle South, was ribb'd"
3034,A FRAGMENT,"And barr'd with bloom on bloom. The sun beneath,"
3035,A FRAGMENT,"Held for a space 'twixt cloud and wave, shower'd down"
3036,A FRAGMENT,"Rays of a mighty circle, weaving over"
3037,A FRAGMENT,That varied wilderness a tissue of light
3038,A FRAGMENT,"Unparallel'd. On the other side the moon,"
3039,A FRAGMENT,"Half-melted into thin blue air, stood still"
3040,A FRAGMENT,"And pale and fibrous as a wither'd leaf,"
3041,A FRAGMENT,Nor yet endured in presence of his eyes
3042,A FRAGMENT,To imbue his lustre; most unloverlike;
3043,A FRAGMENT,Since in his absence full of light and joy
3044,A FRAGMENT,"And giving light to others. But this chiefest,"
3045,A FRAGMENT,"Next to her presence whom I loved so well,"
3046,A FRAGMENT,"Spoke loudly, even into my inmost heart,"
3047,A FRAGMENT,"As to my outward hearing: the loud stream,"
3048,A FRAGMENT,Forth issuing from his portals in the crag
3049,A FRAGMENT,"(A visible link unto the home of my heart),"
3050,A FRAGMENT,"Ran amber toward the West, and nigh the sea,"
3051,A FRAGMENT,"Parting my own loved mountains, was received"
3052,A FRAGMENT,"Shorn of its strength, into the sympathy"
3053,A FRAGMENT,"Of that small bay, which into open main"
3054,A FRAGMENT,Glow'd intermingling close beneath the sun
3055,A FRAGMENT,"Spirit of Love! That little hour was bound,"
3056,A FRAGMENT,"Shut in from Time, and dedicate to thee;"
3057,A FRAGMENT,"Thy fires from heav'n had touch'd it, and the earth"
3058,A FRAGMENT,They fell on became hallow'd evermore.
3059,A FRAGMENT,
3060,A FRAGMENT,"We turn'd: our eyes met: her's were bright, and mine"
3061,A FRAGMENT,"Were dim with floating tears, that shot the sunset,"
3062,A FRAGMENT,In light rings round me; and my name was borne
3063,A FRAGMENT,Upon her breath. Henceforth my name has been
3064,A FRAGMENT,"A hallow'd memory, like the names of old;"
3065,A FRAGMENT,"A center'd, glory-circled memory,"
3066,A FRAGMENT,"And a peculiar treasure, brooking not"
3067,A FRAGMENT,Exchange or currency; and in that hour
3068,A FRAGMENT,"A hope flow'd round me, like a golden mist"
3069,A FRAGMENT,"Charm'd amid eddies of melodious airs,"
3070,A FRAGMENT,"A moment, ere the onward whirlwind shatter it,"
3071,A FRAGMENT,"Waver'd and floated--which was less than Hope,"
3072,A FRAGMENT,Because it lack'd the power of perfect Hope;
3073,A FRAGMENT,"But which was more and higher than all Hope,"
3074,A FRAGMENT,Because all other Hope hath lower aim;
3075,A FRAGMENT,Even that this name to which her seraph lips
3076,A FRAGMENT,"Did lend such gentle utterance, this one name"
3077,A FRAGMENT,"In some obscure hereafter, might inwreathe"
3078,A FRAGMENT,"(How lovelier, nobler then!) her life, her love,"
3079,A FRAGMENT,"With my life, love, soul, spirit and heart and strength."
3080,A FRAGMENT,
3081,A FRAGMENT,"'Brother,' she said, 'let this be call'd henceforth"
3082,A FRAGMENT,"The Hill of Hope'; and I replied: 'O sister,"
3083,A FRAGMENT,My will is one with thine; the Hill of Hope.'
3084,A FRAGMENT,"Nevertheless, we did not change the name."
3085,A FRAGMENT,
3086,A FRAGMENT,Love lieth deep; Love dwells not in lip-depths:
3087,A FRAGMENT,"Love wraps her wings on either side the heart,"
3088,A FRAGMENT,"Constraining it with kisses close and warm,"
3089,A FRAGMENT,Absorbing all the incense of sweet thoughts
3090,A FRAGMENT,So that they pass not to the shrine of sound.
3091,A FRAGMENT,Else had the life of that delighted hour
3092,A FRAGMENT,Drunk in the largeness of the utterance
3093,A FRAGMENT,Of Love; but how should earthly measure mete
3094,A FRAGMENT,"The heavenly unmeasured or unlimited Love,"
3095,A FRAGMENT,Which scarce can tune his high majestic sense
3096,A FRAGMENT,Unto the thunder-song that wheels the spheres;
3097,A FRAGMENT,"Scarce living in the Aeolian harmony,"
3098,A FRAGMENT,And flowing odour of the spacious air;
3099,A FRAGMENT,Scarce housed in the circle of this earth:
3100,A FRAGMENT,"Be cabin'd up in words and syllables,"
3101,A FRAGMENT,Which waste with the breath that made 'em.
3102,A FRAGMENT,Sooner earth
3103,A FRAGMENT,"Might go round heaven, and the straight girth of Time"
3104,A FRAGMENT,"Inswathe the fullness of Eternity,"
3105,A FRAGMENT,Than language grasp the infinite of Love.
3106,A FRAGMENT,"O day, which did enwomb that happy hour,"
3107,A FRAGMENT,"Thou art blest in the years, divinest day!"
3108,A FRAGMENT,O Genius of that hour which dost uphold
3109,A FRAGMENT,"Thy coronal of glory like a God,"
3110,A FRAGMENT,"Amid thy melancholy mates far-seen,"
3111,A FRAGMENT,"Who walk before thee, and whose eyes are dim"
3112,A FRAGMENT,With gazing on the light and depth of thine
3113,A FRAGMENT,Thy name is ever worshipp'd among hours!
3114,A FRAGMENT,"Had I died then, I had not seem'd to die"
3115,A FRAGMENT,"For bliss stood round me like the lights of heaven,"
3116,A FRAGMENT,"That cannot fade, they are so burning bright."
3117,A FRAGMENT,"Had I died then, I had not known the death;"
3118,A FRAGMENT,Planting my feet against this mound of time
3119,A FRAGMENT,"I had thrown me on the vast, and from this impulse"
3120,A FRAGMENT,"Continuing and gathering ever, ever,"
3121,A FRAGMENT,"Agglomerated swiftness, I had lived"
3122,A FRAGMENT,That intense moment thro' eternity.
3123,A FRAGMENT,"Oh, had the Power from whose right hand the light"
3124,A FRAGMENT,"Of Life issueth, and from whose left hand floweth"
3125,A FRAGMENT,"The shadow of Death, perennial effluences,"
3126,A FRAGMENT,"Whereof to all that draw the wholesome air,"
3127,A FRAGMENT,Somewhile the one must overflow the other;
3128,A FRAGMENT,Then had he stemm'd my day with night and driven
3129,A FRAGMENT,My current to the fountain whence it sprang--
3130,A FRAGMENT,Even his own abiding excellence--
3131,A FRAGMENT,"On me, methinks, that shock of gloom had fall'n"
3132,A FRAGMENT,"Unfelt, and like the sun I gazed upon,"
3133,A FRAGMENT,"Which, lapt in seeming dissolution,"
3134,A FRAGMENT,"And dipping his head low beneath the verge,"
3135,A FRAGMENT,"Yet bearing round about him his own day,"
3136,A FRAGMENT,"In confidence of unabated strength,"
3137,A FRAGMENT,"Steppeth from heaven to heaven, from light to light,"
3138,A FRAGMENT,And holding his undimmed forehead far
3139,A FRAGMENT,"Into a clearer zenith, pure of cloud;"
3140,A FRAGMENT,So bearing on thro' Being limitless
3141,A FRAGMENT,"The triumph of this foretaste, I had merged"
3142,A FRAGMENT,"Glory in glory, without sense of change."
3143,A FRAGMENT,
3144,A FRAGMENT,We trod the shadow of the downward hill;
3145,A FRAGMENT,We pass'd from light to dark. On the other side
3146,A FRAGMENT,"Is scooped a cavern and a mountain-hall,"
3147,A FRAGMENT,Which none have fathom'd. If you go far in
3148,A FRAGMENT,(The country people rumour) you may hear
3149,A FRAGMENT,"The moaning of the woman and the child,"
3150,A FRAGMENT,Shut in the secret chambers of the rock.
3151,A FRAGMENT,I too have heard a sound--perchance of streams
3152,A FRAGMENT,"Running far-off within its inmost halls,"
3153,A FRAGMENT,"The home of darkness, but the cavern mouth,"
3154,A FRAGMENT,Half overtrailed with a wanton weed
3155,A FRAGMENT,"Gives birth to a brawling stream, that stepping lightly"
3156,A FRAGMENT,"Adown a natural stair of tangled roots,"
3157,A FRAGMENT,Is presently received in a sweet grove
3158,A FRAGMENT,"Of eglantine, a place of burial"
3159,A FRAGMENT,Far lovelier than its cradle; for unseen
3160,A FRAGMENT,"But taken with the sweetness of the place,"
3161,A FRAGMENT,It giveth out a constant melody
3162,A FRAGMENT,That drowns the nearer echoes. Lower down
3163,A FRAGMENT,"Spreads out a little lake, that, flooding, makes"
3164,A FRAGMENT,Cushions of yellow sand; and from the woods
3165,A FRAGMENT,That belt it rise three dark tall cypresses;
3166,A FRAGMENT,"Three cypresses, symbols of mortal woe,"
3167,A FRAGMENT,That men plant over graves.
3168,A FRAGMENT,
3169,A FRAGMENT,"Hither we came,"
3170,A FRAGMENT,And sitting down upon the golden moss
3171,A FRAGMENT,"Held converse sweet and low--low converse sweet,"
3172,A FRAGMENT,In which our voices bore least part. The wind
3173,A FRAGMENT,"Told a love-tale beside us, how he woo'd"
3174,A FRAGMENT,"The waters, and the crisp'd waters lisp'd"
3175,A FRAGMENT,"The kisses of the wind, that, sick with love,"
3176,A FRAGMENT,"Fainted at intervals, and grew again"
3177,A FRAGMENT,To utterance of passion. Ye cannot shape
3178,A FRAGMENT,Fancy so fair as is this memory.
3179,A FRAGMENT,Methought all excellence that ever was
3180,A FRAGMENT,"Had drawn herself from many thousand years,"
3181,A FRAGMENT,"And all the separate Edens of this earth,"
3182,A FRAGMENT,"To centre in this place and time. I listen'd,"
3183,A FRAGMENT,And her words stole with most prevailing sweetness
3184,A FRAGMENT,"Into my heart, as thronged fancies come,"
3185,A FRAGMENT,"All unawares, into the poet's brain;"
3186,A FRAGMENT,"Or as the dew-drops on the petal hung,"
3187,A FRAGMENT,"When summer winds break their soft sleep with sighs,"
3188,A FRAGMENT,Creep down into the bottom of the flower.
3189,A FRAGMENT,Her words were like a coronal of wild blooms
3190,A FRAGMENT,"Strung in the very negligence of Art,"
3191,A FRAGMENT,"Or in the art of Nature, where each rose"
3192,A FRAGMENT,"Doth faint upon the bosom of the other,"
3193,A FRAGMENT,Flooding its angry cheek with odorous tears.
3194,A FRAGMENT,"So each with each inwoven lived with each,"
3195,A FRAGMENT,And were in union more than double-sweet.
3196,A FRAGMENT,What marvel my Camilla told me all?
3197,A FRAGMENT,"It was so happy an hour, so sweet a place,"
3198,A FRAGMENT,"And I was as the brother of her blood,"
3199,A FRAGMENT,"And by that name was wont to live in her speech,"
3200,A FRAGMENT,Dear name! which had too much of nearness in it
3201,A FRAGMENT,And heralded the distance of this time.
3202,A FRAGMENT,"At first her voice was very sweet and low,"
3203,A FRAGMENT,As tho' she were afeard of utterance;
3204,A FRAGMENT,"But in the onward current of her speech,"
3205,A FRAGMENT,(As echoes of the hollow-banked brooks
3206,A FRAGMENT,Are fashioned by the channel which they keep)
3207,A FRAGMENT,"His words did of their meaning borrow sound,"
3208,A FRAGMENT,"Her cheek did catch the colour of her words,"
3209,A FRAGMENT,"I heard and trembled, yet I could but hear;"
3210,A FRAGMENT,"My heart paused,--my raised eyelids would not fall,"
3211,A FRAGMENT,But still I kept my eyes upon the sky.
3212,A FRAGMENT,"I seem'd the only part of Time stood still,"
3213,A FRAGMENT,And saw the motion of all other things;
3214,A FRAGMENT,"While her words, syllable by syllable,"
3215,A FRAGMENT,"Like water, drop by drop, upon my ear"
3216,A FRAGMENT,"Fell, and I wish'd, yet wish'd her not to speak,"
3217,A FRAGMENT,"But she spoke on, for I did name no wish."
3218,A FRAGMENT,What marvel my Camilla told me all
3219,A FRAGMENT,"Her maiden dignities of Hope and Love,"
3220,A FRAGMENT,'Perchance' she said 'return'd.' Even then the stars
3221,A FRAGMENT,Did tremble in their stations as I gazed;
3222,A FRAGMENT,"But she spake on, for I did name no wish,"
3223,A FRAGMENT,"No wish--no hope. Hope was not wholly dead,"
3224,A FRAGMENT,"But breathing hard at the approach of Death,"
3225,A FRAGMENT,Updrawn in expectation of her change--
3226,A FRAGMENT,"Camilla, my Camilla, who was mine"
3227,A FRAGMENT,No longer in the dearest use of mine--
3228,A FRAGMENT,The written secrets of her inmost soul
3229,A FRAGMENT,"Lay like an open scroll before my view,"
3230,A FRAGMENT,"And my eyes read, they read aright, her heart"
3231,A FRAGMENT,Was Lionel's: it seem'd as tho' a link
3232,A FRAGMENT,Of some light chain within my inmost frame
3233,A FRAGMENT,Was riven in twain: that life I heeded not
3234,A FRAGMENT,"Flow'd from me, and the darkness of the grave,"
3235,A FRAGMENT,"The darkness of the grave and utter night,"
3236,A FRAGMENT,"Did swallow up my vision: at her feet,"
3237,A FRAGMENT,"Even the feet of her I loved, I fell,"
3238,A FRAGMENT,Smit with exceeding sorrow unto death.
3239,A FRAGMENT,
3240,A FRAGMENT,Then had the earth beneath me yawning given
3241,A FRAGMENT,Sign of convulsion; and tho' horrid rifts
3242,A FRAGMENT,Sent up the moaning of unhappy spirits
3243,A FRAGMENT,"Imprison'd in her centre, with the heat"
3244,A FRAGMENT,"Of their infolding element; had the angels,"
3245,A FRAGMENT,"The watchers at heaven's gate, push'd them apart,"
3246,A FRAGMENT,And from the golden threshold had down-roll'd
3247,A FRAGMENT,"Their heaviest thunder, I had lain as still,"
3248,A FRAGMENT,And blind and motionless as then I lay!
3249,A FRAGMENT,"White as quench'd ashes, cold as were the hopes"
3250,A FRAGMENT,Of my lorn love! What happy air shall woo
3251,A FRAGMENT,"The wither'd leaf fall'n in the woods, or blasted"
3252,A FRAGMENT,Upon this bough? a lightning stroke had come
3253,A FRAGMENT,Even from that Heaven in whose light I bloom'd
3254,A FRAGMENT,"And taken away the greenness of my life,"
3255,A FRAGMENT,The blossom and the fragrance. Who was cursed
3256,A FRAGMENT,But I? who miserable but I? even Misery
3257,A FRAGMENT,"Forgot herself in that extreme distress,"
3258,A FRAGMENT,And with the overdoing of her part
3259,A FRAGMENT,Did fall away into oblivion.
3260,A FRAGMENT,The night in pity took away my day
3261,A FRAGMENT,"Because my grief as yet was newly born,"
3262,A FRAGMENT,"Of too weak eyes to look upon the light,"
3263,A FRAGMENT,"And with the hasty notice of the ear,"
3264,A FRAGMENT,Frail life was startled from the tender love
3265,A FRAGMENT,Of him she brooded over. Would I had lain
3266,A FRAGMENT,Until the pleached ivy tress had wound
3267,A FRAGMENT,"Round my worn limbs, and the wild briar had driven"
3268,A FRAGMENT,Its knotted thorns thro' my unpaining brows
3269,A FRAGMENT,Leaning its roses on my faded eyes.
3270,A FRAGMENT,"The wind had blown above me, and the rain"
3271,A FRAGMENT,"Had fall'n upon me, and the gilded snake"
3272,A FRAGMENT,"Had nestled in this bosomthrone of love,"
3273,A FRAGMENT,But I had been at rest for evermore.
3274,A FRAGMENT,"Long time entrancement held me: all too soon,"
3275,A FRAGMENT,Life (like a wanton too-officious friend
3276,A FRAGMENT,"Who will not hear denial, vain and rude"
3277,A FRAGMENT,With proffer of unwished for services)
3278,A FRAGMENT,"Entering all the avenues of sense,"
3279,A FRAGMENT,"Pass'd thro' into his citadel, the brain"
3280,A FRAGMENT,With hated warmth of apprehensiveness:
3281,A FRAGMENT,And first the chillness of the mountain stream
3282,A FRAGMENT,"Smote on my brow, and then I seem'd to hear"
3283,A FRAGMENT,"Its murmur, as the drowning seaman hears,"
3284,A FRAGMENT,"Who with his head below the surface dropt,"
3285,A FRAGMENT,Listens the dreadful murmur indistinct
3286,A FRAGMENT,"Of the confused seas, and knoweth not"
3287,A FRAGMENT,Beyond the sound he lists: and then came in
3288,A FRAGMENT,"O'erhead the white light of the weary moon,"
3289,A FRAGMENT,Diffused and molten into flaky cloud.
3290,A FRAGMENT,"Was my sight drunk, that it did shape to me"
3291,A FRAGMENT,Him who should own that name? or had my fancy
3292,A FRAGMENT,"So lethargised discernment in the sense,"
3293,A FRAGMENT,"That she did act the step-dame to mine eyes,"
3294,A FRAGMENT,"Warping their nature, till they minister'd"
3295,A FRAGMENT,Unto her swift conceits? 'Twere better thus
3296,A FRAGMENT,If so be that the memory of that sound
3297,A FRAGMENT,"With mighty evocation, had updrawn"
3298,A FRAGMENT,The fashion and the phantasm of the form
3299,A FRAGMENT,It should attach to. There was no such thing.--
3300,A FRAGMENT,"It was the man she loved, even Lionel,"
3301,A FRAGMENT,"The lover Lionel, the happy Lionel,"
3302,A FRAGMENT,All joy; who drew the happy atmosphere
3303,A FRAGMENT,"Of my unhappy sighs, fed with my tears,"
3304,A FRAGMENT,To him the honey dews of orient hope.
3305,A FRAGMENT,"Oh! rather had some loathly ghastful brow,"
3306,A FRAGMENT,"Half-bursten from the shroud, in cere cloth bound,"
3307,A FRAGMENT,"The dead skin withering on the fretted bone,"
3308,A FRAGMENT,The very spirit of Paleness made still paler
3309,A FRAGMENT,"By the shuddering moonlight, fix'd his eyes on mine"
3310,A FRAGMENT,Horrible with the anger and the heat
3311,A FRAGMENT,"Of the remorseful soul alive within,"
3312,A FRAGMENT,And damn'd unto his loathed tenement.
3313,A FRAGMENT,Methinks I could have sooner met that gaze!
3314,A FRAGMENT,"Oh, how her choice did leap forth from his eyes!"
3315,A FRAGMENT,"Oh, how her love did clothe itself in smiles"
3316,A FRAGMENT,About his lips! This was the very arch-mock
3317,A FRAGMENT,"And insolence of uncontrolled Fate,"
3318,A FRAGMENT,When the effect weigh'd seas upon my head
3319,A FRAGMENT,To twit me with the cause.
3320,A FRAGMENT,Why how was this?
3321,A FRAGMENT,"Could he not walk what paths he chose, nor breathe"
3322,A FRAGMENT,"What airs he pleased! Was not the wide world free,"
3323,A FRAGMENT,With all her interchange of hill and plain
3324,A FRAGMENT,"To him as well as me? I know not, faith:"
3325,A FRAGMENT,"But Misery, like a fretful, wayward child,"
3326,A FRAGMENT,"Refused to look his author in the face,"
3327,A FRAGMENT,"Must he come my way too? Was not the South,"
3328,A FRAGMENT,"The East, the West, all open, if he had fall'n"
3329,A FRAGMENT,"In love in twilight? Why should he come my way,"
3330,A FRAGMENT,"Robed in those robes of light I must not wear,"
3331,A FRAGMENT,With that great crown of beams about his brows?
3332,A FRAGMENT,Come like an angel to a damned soul?
3333,A FRAGMENT,To tell him of the bliss he had with God;
3334,A FRAGMENT,"Come like a careless and a greedy heir,"
3335,A FRAGMENT,That scarce can wait the reading of the will
3336,A FRAGMENT,Before he takes possession? Was mine a mood
3337,A FRAGMENT,"To be invaded rudely, and not rather"
3338,A FRAGMENT,"A sacred, secret, unapproached woe"
3339,A FRAGMENT,Unspeakable? I was shut up with grief;
3340,A FRAGMENT,"She took the body of my past delight,"
3341,A FRAGMENT,"Narded, and swathed and balm'd it for herself,"
3342,A FRAGMENT,"And laid it in a new-hewn sepulchre,"
3343,A FRAGMENT,Where man had never lain. I was led mute
3344,A FRAGMENT,Into her temple like a sacrifice;
3345,A FRAGMENT,"I was the high-priest in her holiest place,"
3346,A FRAGMENT,Not to be loudly broken in upon.
3347,A FRAGMENT,"Oh! friend, thoughts deep and heavy as these well-nigh"
3348,A FRAGMENT,O'erbore the limits of my brain; but he
3349,A FRAGMENT,"Bent o'er me, and my neck his arm upstay'd"
3350,A FRAGMENT,"From earth. I thought it was an adder's fold,"
3351,A FRAGMENT,"And once I strove to disengage myself,"
3352,A FRAGMENT,"But fail'd, I was so feeble. She was there too:"
3353,A FRAGMENT,"She bent above me too: her cheek was pale,"
3354,A FRAGMENT,Oh! very fair and pale: rare pity had stolen
3355,A FRAGMENT,"The living bloom away, as tho' a red rose"
3356,A FRAGMENT,Should change into a white one suddenly.
3357,A FRAGMENT,"Her eyes, I saw, were full of tears in the morn,"
3358,A FRAGMENT,And some few drops of that distressful rain
3359,A FRAGMENT,"Being wafted on the wind, drove in my sight,"
3360,A FRAGMENT,And being there they did break forth afresh
3361,A FRAGMENT,"In a new birth, immingled with my own,"
3362,A FRAGMENT,And still bewept my grief. Keeping unchanged
3363,A FRAGMENT,"The purport of their coinage. Her long ringlets,"
3364,A FRAGMENT,"Drooping and beaten with the plaining wind,"
3365,A FRAGMENT,Did brush my forehead in their to-and-fro:
3366,A FRAGMENT,For in the sudden anguish of her heart
3367,A FRAGMENT,"Loosed from their simple thrall they had flowed abroad,"
3368,A FRAGMENT,"And onward floating in a full, dark wave,"
3369,A FRAGMENT,"Parted on either side her argent neck,"
3370,A FRAGMENT,"Mantling her form half way. She, when I woke,"
3371,A FRAGMENT,After my refluent health made tender quest
3372,A FRAGMENT,"Unanswer'd, for I spoke not: for the sound"
3373,A FRAGMENT,"Of that dear voice so musically low,"
3374,A FRAGMENT,"And now first heard with any sense of pain,"
3375,A FRAGMENT,"As it had taken life away before,"
3376,A FRAGMENT,Choked all the syllables that in my throat
3377,A FRAGMENT,"Strove to uprise, laden with mournful thanks,"
3378,A FRAGMENT,"From my full heart: and ever since that hour,"
3379,A FRAGMENT,My voice hath somewhat falter'd--and what wonder
3380,A FRAGMENT,"That when hope died, part of her eloquence"
3381,A FRAGMENT,"Died with her? He, the blissful lover, too,"
3382,A FRAGMENT,From his great hoard of happiness distill'd
3383,A FRAGMENT,"Some drops of solace; like a vain rich man,"
3384,A FRAGMENT,"That, having always prosper'd in the world,"
3385,A FRAGMENT,Folding his hands deals comfortable words
3386,A FRAGMENT,"To hearts wounded for ever; yet, in truth,"
3387,A FRAGMENT,"Fair speech was his and delicate of phrase,"
3388,A FRAGMENT,"Falling in whispers on the sense, address'd"
3389,A FRAGMENT,"More to the inward than the outward ear,"
3390,A FRAGMENT,As rain of the midsummer midnight soft
3391,A FRAGMENT,"Scarce-heard, recalling fragrance and the green"
3392,A FRAGMENT,Of the dead spring--such as in other minds
3393,A FRAGMENT,Had film'd the margents of the recent wound.
3394,A FRAGMENT,"And why was I to darken their pure love,"
3395,A FRAGMENT,"If, as I knew, they two did love each other,"
3396,A FRAGMENT,Because my own was darken'd? Why was I
3397,A FRAGMENT,"To stand within the level of their hopes,"
3398,A FRAGMENT,"Because my hope was widow'd, like the cur"
3399,A FRAGMENT,In the child's adage? Did I love Camilla?
3400,A FRAGMENT,Ye know that I did love her: to this present
3401,A FRAGMENT,"My full-orb'd love hath waned not. Did I love her,"
3402,A FRAGMENT,And could I look upon her tearful eyes?
3403,A FRAGMENT,Tears wept for me; for me--weep at my grief?
3404,A FRAGMENT,What had _she_ done to weep--let my heart
3405,A FRAGMENT,Break rather--whom the gentlest airs of heaven
3406,A FRAGMENT,Should kiss with an unwonted gentleness.
3407,A FRAGMENT,Her love did murder mine; what then? she deem'd
3408,A FRAGMENT,I wore a brother's mind: she call'd me brother:
3409,A FRAGMENT,She told me all her love: she shall not weep.
3410,A FRAGMENT,
3411,A FRAGMENT,The brightness of a burning thought awhile
3412,A FRAGMENT,"Battailing with the glooms of my dark will,"
3413,A FRAGMENT,"Moonlike emerged, lit up unto itself,"
3414,A FRAGMENT,"Upon the depths of an unfathom'd woe,"
3415,A FRAGMENT,"Reflex of action, starting up at once,"
3416,A FRAGMENT,"As men do from a vague and horrid dream,"
3417,A FRAGMENT,"And throwing by all consciousness of self,"
3418,A FRAGMENT,In eager haste I shook him by the hand;
3419,A FRAGMENT,Then flinging myself down upon my knees
3420,A FRAGMENT,"Even where the grass was warm where I had lain,"
3421,A FRAGMENT,I pray'd aloud to God that he would hold
3422,A FRAGMENT,"The hand of blessing over Lionel,"
3423,A FRAGMENT,"And her whom he would make his wedded wife,"
3424,A FRAGMENT,"Camilla! May their days be golden days,"
3425,A FRAGMENT,"And their long life a dream of linked love,"
3426,A FRAGMENT,"From which may rude Death never startle them,"
3427,A FRAGMENT,But grow upon them like a glorious vision
3428,A FRAGMENT,"Of unconceived and awful happiness,"
3429,A FRAGMENT,"Solemn but splendid, full of shapes and sounds,"
3430,A FRAGMENT,Swallowing its precedent in victory.
3431,A FRAGMENT,"Let them so love that men and boys may say,"
3432,A FRAGMENT,Lo! how they love each other! till their love
3433,A FRAGMENT,"Shall ripen to a proverb unto all,"
3434,A FRAGMENT,Known when their faces are forgot in the land.
3435,A FRAGMENT,"And as for me, Camilla, as for me,"
3436,A FRAGMENT,"Think not thy tears will make my name grow green,--"
3437,A FRAGMENT,The dew of tears is an unwholesome dew.
3438,A FRAGMENT,"The course of Hope is dried,--the life o' the plant--"
3439,A FRAGMENT,They will but sicken the sick plant more.
3440,A FRAGMENT,"Deem then I love thee but as brothers do,"
3441,A FRAGMENT,So shalt thou love me still as sisters do;
3442,A FRAGMENT,"Or if thou dream'st aught farther, dream but how"
3443,A FRAGMENT,"I could have loved thee, had there been none else"
3444,A FRAGMENT,"To love as lovers, loved again by thee."
3445,A FRAGMENT,
3446,A FRAGMENT,"Or this, or somewhat like to this, I spoke,"
3447,A FRAGMENT,When I did see her weep so ruefully;
3448,A FRAGMENT,For sure my love should ne'er induce the front
3449,A FRAGMENT,"And mask of Hate, whom woful ailments"
3450,A FRAGMENT,Of unavailing tears and heart deep moans
3451,A FRAGMENT,"Feed and envenom, as the milky blood"
3452,A FRAGMENT,Of hateful herbs a subtle-fanged snake.
3453,A FRAGMENT,"Shall Love pledge Hatred in her bitter draughts,"
3454,A FRAGMENT,And batten on his poisons? Love forbid!
3455,A FRAGMENT,"Love passeth not the threshold of cold Hate,"
3456,A FRAGMENT,And Hate is strange beneath the roof of Love.
3457,A FRAGMENT,"O Love, if thou be'st Love, dry up these tears"
3458,A FRAGMENT,"Shed for the love of Love; for tho' mine image,"
3459,A FRAGMENT,"The subject of thy power, be cold in her,"
3460,A FRAGMENT,"Yet, like cold snow, it melteth in the source"
3461,A FRAGMENT,"Of these sad tears, and feeds their downward flow."
3462,A FRAGMENT,"So Love, arraign'd to judgment and to death,"
3463,A FRAGMENT,Received unto himself a part of blame.
3464,A FRAGMENT,"Being guiltless, as an innocent prisoner,"
3465,A FRAGMENT,"Who when the woful sentence hath been past,"
3466,A FRAGMENT,And all the clearness of his fame hath gone
3467,A FRAGMENT,"Beneath the shadow of the curse of men,"
3468,A FRAGMENT,First falls asleep in swoon. Wherefrom awaked
3469,A FRAGMENT,"And looking round upon his tearful friends,"
3470,A FRAGMENT,Forthwith and in his agony conceives
3471,A FRAGMENT,A shameful sense as of a cleaving crime--
3472,A FRAGMENT,For whence without some guilt should such grief be?
3473,A FRAGMENT,"So died that hour, and fell into the abysm"
3474,A FRAGMENT,"Of forms outworn, but not to be outworn,"
3475,A FRAGMENT,Who never hail'd another worth the Life
3476,A FRAGMENT,"That made it sensible. So died that hour,"
3477,A FRAGMENT,Like odour wrapt into the winged wind
3478,A FRAGMENT,Borne into alien lands and far away.
3479,A FRAGMENT,"There be some hearts so airy-fashioned,"
3480,A FRAGMENT,"That in the death of love, if e'er they loved,"
3481,A FRAGMENT,On that sharp ridge of utmost doom ride highly
3482,A FRAGMENT,Above the perilous seas of change and chance;
3483,A FRAGMENT,"Nay, more, holds out the lights of cheerfulness;"
3484,A FRAGMENT,"As the tall ship, that many a dreary year"
3485,A FRAGMENT,"Knit to some dismal sandbank far at sea,"
3486,A FRAGMENT,"All through the lifelong hours of utter dark,"
3487,A FRAGMENT,Showers slanting light upon the dolorous wave.
3488,A FRAGMENT,For me all other Hopes did sway from that

3490,A FRAGMENT,"Crush'd link on link into the beaten earth,"
3491,A FRAGMENT,"And Love did walk with banish'd Hope no more,"
3492,A FRAGMENT,"It was ill-done to part ye, Sisters fair;"
3493,A FRAGMENT,"Love's arms were wreathed about the neck of Hope,"
3494,A FRAGMENT,"And Hope kiss'd Love, and Love drew in her breath"
3495,A FRAGMENT,"In that close kiss, and drank her whisper'd tales."
3496,A FRAGMENT,"They said that Love would die when Hope was gone,"
3497,A FRAGMENT,"And Love mourned long, and sorrowed after Hope;"
3498,A FRAGMENT,"At last she sought out memory, and they trod"
3499,A FRAGMENT,"The same old paths where Love had walked with Hope,"
3500,A FRAGMENT,And Memory fed the soul of Love with tears.

3503,II,
3504,II,"From that time forth I would not see her more,"
3505,II,But many weary moons I lived alone--
3506,II,"Alone, and in the heart of the great forest."
3507,II,Sometimes upon the hills beside the sea
3508,II,"All day I watched the floating isles of shade,"
3509,II,"And sometimes on the shore, upon the sands"
3510,II,"Insensibly I drew her name, until"
3511,II,The meaning of the letters shot into
3512,II,My brain: anon the wanton billow wash'd
3513,II,"Them over, till they faded like my love."
3514,II,The hollow caverns heard me--the black brooks
3515,II,"Of the mid-forest heard me--the soft winds,"
3516,II,"Laden with thistledown and seeds of flowers,"
3517,II,"Paused in their course to hear me, for my voice"
3518,II,"Was all of thee: the merry linnet knew me,"
3519,II,"The squirrel knew me, and the dragon-fly"
3520,II,Shot by me like a flash of purple fire.
3521,II,"The rough briar tore my bleeding palms; the hemlock,"
3522,II,"Brow high, did strike my forehead as I pas'd;"
3523,II,"Yet trod I not the wild-flower in my path,"
3524,II,Nor bruised the wild-bird's egg.
3525,II,Was this the end?
3526,II,Why grew we then together i' the same plot?
3527,II,Why fed we the same fountain? drew the same sun?
3528,II,Why were our mothers branches of one stem?
3529,II,"Why were we one in all things, save in that"
3530,II,Where to have been one had been the roof and crown
3531,II,Of all I hoped and fear'd? if that same nearness
3532,II,"Were father to this distance, and that _one_"
3533,II,Vauntcourier this _double_? If affection
3534,II,"Living slew Love, and Sympathy hew'd out"
3535,II,The bosom-sepulchre of Sympathy.
3536,II,
3537,II,Chiefly I sought the cavern and the hill
3538,II,"Where last we roam'd together, for the sound"
3539,II,"Of the loud stream was pleasant, and the wind"
3540,II,Came wooingly with violet smells. Sometimes
3541,II,"All day I sat within the cavern-mouth,"
3542,II,Fixing my eyes on those three cypress-cones
3543,II,Which spired above the wood; and with mad hand
3544,II,"Tearing the bright leaves of the ivy-screen,"
3545,II,"I cast them in the noisy brook beneath,"
3546,II,And watch'd them till they vanished from my sight
3547,II,Beneath the bower of wreathed eglantines:
3548,II,"And all the fragments of the living rock,"
3549,II,"(Huge splinters, which the sap of earliest showers,"
3550,II,"Or moisture of the vapour, left in clinging,"
3551,II,"When the shrill storm-blast feeds it from behind,"
3552,II,"And scatters it before, had shatter'd from"
3553,II,"The mountain, till they fell, and with the shock"
3554,II,"Half dug their own graves), in mine agony,"
3555,II,Did I make bear of all the deep rich moss
3556,II,Wherewith the dashing runnel in the spring
3557,II,Had liveried them all over. In my brain
3558,II,"The spirit seem'd to flag from thought to thought,"
3559,II,Like moonlight wandering through a mist: my blood
3560,II,Crept like the drains of a marsh thro' all my body;
3561,II,"The motions of my heart seem'd far within me,"
3562,II,"Unfrequent, low, as tho' it told its pulses;"
3563,II,"And yet it shook me, that my frame did shudder,"
3564,II,As it were drawn asunder by the rack.
3565,II,"But over the deep graves of Hope and Fear,"
3566,II,"The wreck of ruin'd life and shatter'd thought,"
3567,II,"Brooded one master-passion evermore,"
3568,II,Like to a low hung and a fiery sky
3569,II,"Above some great metropolis, earth shock'd"
3570,II,"Hung round with ragged-rimmed burning folds,"
3571,II,Embathing all with wild and woful hues--
3572,II,"Great hills of ruins, and collapsed masses"
3573,II,"Of thunder-shaken columns, indistinct"
3574,II,And fused together in the tyrannous light.
3575,II,
3576,II,So gazed I on the ruins of that thought
3577,II,Which was the playmate of my youth--for which
3578,II,"I lived and breathed: the dew, the sun, the rain,"
3579,II,Unto the growth of body and of mind;
3580,II,"The blood, the breath, the feeling and the motion,"
3581,II,"The slope into the current of my years,"
3582,II,Which drove them onward--made them sensible;
3583,II,"The precious jewel of my honour'd life,"
3584,II,"Erewhile close couch'd in golden happiness,"
3585,II,"Now proved counterfeit, was shaken out,"
3586,II,"And, trampled on, left to its own decay."

3593,II,"Sometimes I thought Camilla was no more,"
3594,II,"Some one had told me she was dead, and ask'd me"
3595,II,If I would see her burial: then I seem'd
3596,II,"To rise, and thro' the forest-shadow borne"
3597,II,"With more than mortal swiftness, I ran down"
3598,II,"The sleepy sea-bank, till I came upon"
3599,II,"The rear of a procession, curving round"
3600,II,The silver-sheeted bay: in front of which
3601,II,"Six stately virgins, all in white, upbare"
3602,II,"A broad earth-sweeping pall of whitest lawn,"
3603,II,"Wreathed round the bier with garlands: in the distance,"
3604,II,"From out the yellow woods, upon the hill,"
3605,II,Look'd forth the summit and the pinnacles
3606,II,"Of a grey steeple. All the pageantry,"
3607,II,"Save those six virgins which upheld the bier,"
3608,II,Were stoled from head to foot in flowing black;
3609,II,"One walk'd abreast with me, and veiled his brow,"
3610,II,And he was loud in weeping and in praise
3611,II,Of the departed: a strong sympathy
3612,II,Shook all my soul: I flung myself upon him
3613,II,"In tears and cries: I told him all my love,"
3614,II,How I had loved her from the first; whereat
3615,II,"He shrunk and howl'd, and from his brow drew back"
3616,II,His hand to push me from him; and the face
3617,II,"The very face and form of Lionel,"
3618,II,"Flash'd through my eyes into my innermost brain,"
3619,II,"And at his feet I seemed to faint and fall,"
3620,II,"To fall and die away. I could not rise,"
3621,II,"Albeit I strove to follow. They pass'd on,"
3622,II,The lordly Phantasms; in their floating folds
3623,II,They pass'd and were no more: but I had fall'n
3624,II,Prone by the dashing runnel on the grass.
3625,II,
3626,II,"Always th' inaudible, invisible thought"
3627,II,"Artificer and subject, lord and slave"
3628,II,"Shaped by the audible and visible,"
3629,II,Moulded the audible and visible;
3630,II,"All crisped sounds of wave, and leaf and wind,"
3631,II,Flatter'd the fancy of my fading brain;
3632,II,"The storm-pavilion'd element, the wood,"
3633,II,"The mountain, the three cypresses, the cave,"
3634,II,Were wrought into the tissue of my dream.
3635,II,"The moanings in the forest, the loud stream,"
3636,II,"Awoke me not, but were a part of sleep;"
3637,II,"And voices in the distance, calling to me,"
3638,II,"And in my vision bidding me dream on,"
3639,II,"Like sounds within the twilight realms of dreams,"
3640,II,"Which wander round the bases of the hills,"
3641,II,"And murmur in the low-dropt eaves of sleep,"
3642,II,But faint within the portals. Oftentimes
3643,II,"The vision had fair prelude, in the end"
3644,II,"Opening on darkness, stately vestibules"
3645,II,"To cares and shows of Death; whether the mind,"
3646,II,"With a revenge even to itself unknown,"
3647,II,Made strange division of its suffering
3648,II,"With her, whom to have suffering view'd had been"
3649,II,"Extremest pain; or that the clear-eyed Spirit,"
3650,II,"Being blasted in the Present, grew at length"
3651,II,Prophetical and prescient of whate'er
3652,II,The Future had in store; or that which most
3653,II,"Enchains belief, the sorrow of my spirit"
3654,II,Was of so wide a compass it took in
3655,II,"All I had loved, and my dull agony."
3656,II,"Ideally to her transferred, became"
3657,II,Anguish intolerable.
3658,II,The day waned;
3659,II,Alone I sat with her: about my brow
3660,II,Her warm breath floated in the utterance
3661,II,Of silver-chorded tones: her lips were sunder'd
3662,II,"With smiles of tranquil bliss, which broke in light"
3663,II,Like morning from her eyes--her eloquent eyes
3664,II,"(As I have seen them many hundred times),"
3665,II,"Fill'd all with clear pure fire, thro' mine down rain'd"
3666,II,Their spirit-searching splendours. As a vision
3667,II,"Unto a haggard prisoner, iron-stay'd"
3668,II,In damp and dismal dungeons underground
3669,II,"Confined on points of faith, when strength is shock'd"
3670,II,"With torment, and expectancy of worse"
3671,II,"Upon the morrow, thro' the ragged walls,"
3672,II,"All unawares before his half-shut eyes,"
3673,II,"Comes in upon him in the dead of night,"
3674,II,"And with th' excess of sweetness and of awe,"
3675,II,"Makes the heart tremble, and the eyes run over"
3676,II,Upon his steely gyves; so those fair eyes
3677,II,Shone on my darkness forms which ever stood
3678,II,"Within the magic cirque of memory,"
3679,II,"Invisible but deathless, waiting still"
3680,II,The edict of the will to reassume
3681,II,The semblance of those rare realities
3682,II,"Of which they were the mirrors. Now the light,"
3683,II,"Which was their life, burst through the cloud of thought"
3684,II,"Keen, irrepressible."
3685,II,It was a room
3686,II,"Within the summer-house of which I spoke,"
3687,II,"Hung round with paintings of the sea, and one"
3688,II,"A vessel in mid-ocean, her heaved prow"
3689,II,"Clambering, the mast bent, and the revin wind"
3690,II,"In her sail roaring. From the outer day,"
3691,II,Betwixt the closest ivies came a broad
3692,II,"And solid beam of isolated light,"
3693,II,"Crowded with driving atomies, and fell"
3694,II,"Slanting upon that picture, from prime youth"
3695,II,"Well-known, well-loved. She drew it long ago"
3696,II,"Forth gazing on the waste and open sea,"
3697,II,One morning when the upblown billow ran
3698,II,"Shoreward beneath red clouds, and I had pour'd"
3699,II,Into the shadowing pencil's naked forms
3700,II,Colour and life: it was a bond and seal
3701,II,"Of friendship, spoken of with tearful smiles;"
3702,II,"A monument of childhood and of love,"
3703,II,The poesy of childhood; my lost love
3704,II,Symbol'd in storm. We gazed on it together
3705,II,"In mute and glad remembrance, and each heart"
3706,II,"Grew closer to the other, and the eye"
3707,II,"Was riveted and charm-bound, gazing like"
3708,II,"The Indian on a still-eyed snake, low crouch'd"
3709,II,"A beauty which is death, when all at once"
3710,II,"That painted vessel, as with inner life,"
3711,II,'Gan rock and heave upon that painted sea;
3712,II,"An earthquake, my loud heartbeats, made the ground"
3713,II,"Roll under us, and all at once soul, life,"
3714,II,"And breath, and motion, pass'd and flow'd away"
3715,II,To those unreal billows: round and round
3716,II,"A whirlwind caught and bore us; mighty gyves,"
3717,II,"Rapid and vast, of hissing spray wind-driven"
3718,II,Far through the dizzy dark. Aloud she shriek'd--
3719,II,My heart was cloven with pain. I wound my arms
3720,II,About her: we whirl'd giddily: the wind
3721,II,Sung: but I clasp'd her without fear: her weight
3722,II,"Shrank in my grasp, and over my dim eyes"
3723,II,"And parted lips which drank her breath, down hung"
3724,II,"The jaws of Death: I, screaming, from me flung"
3725,II,The empty phantom: all the sway and whirl
3726,II,"Of the storm dropt to windless calm, and I"
3727,II,Down welter'd thro' the dark ever and ever.
