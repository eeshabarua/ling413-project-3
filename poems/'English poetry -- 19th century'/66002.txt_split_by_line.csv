130,VICTOR HUGO.,"How sweet, how different a thing!"
131,VICTOR HUGO.,And when I come where none are near
132,VICTOR HUGO.,I open all my heart and sing.
133,VICTOR HUGO.,
134,VICTOR HUGO.,"I am made one with these indeed,"
135,VICTOR HUGO.,And give them all the love they need--
136,VICTOR HUGO.,Such love as they would have of me:
137,VICTOR HUGO.,"But in my heart--ah, let it be!--"
138,VICTOR HUGO.,I think of it when none is nigh--

150,VICTOR HUGO.,O when the shroud of night is spread

160,VICTOR HUGO.,"Till present, and remembered bliss,"

174,VICTOR HUGO.,I go with them; and in their sight
175,VICTOR HUGO.,"I would not scorn their little light,"

177,VICTOR HUGO.,But when I kneel before the shrine
178,VICTOR HUGO.,"Of some base deity of theirs,"
179,VICTOR HUGO.,"I pray all inwardly to mine,"
180,VICTOR HUGO.,And send my soul up with my prayers:
181,VICTOR HUGO.,
182,VICTOR HUGO.,"For I--ah, to myself I say--"
183,VICTOR HUGO.,I have a heaven though far away;
184,VICTOR HUGO.,"And there my Love went long ago,"

484,SERAPHITUS.,
485,SERAPHITUS.,A new delicious music erred
486,SERAPHITUS.,For ever through the devious ways
487,SERAPHITUS.,Tangled with blooming of each word;
488,SERAPHITUS.,As though in that enchanted maze
489,SERAPHITUS.,Some sweet and most celestial bird
490,SERAPHITUS.,"Were caught, and, hid from every gaze,"
491,SERAPHITUS.,Did there pour forth such song as stirred
492,SERAPHITUS.,All men who heard.
493,SERAPHITUS.,
494,SERAPHITUS.,Before him was perpetual birth
495,SERAPHITUS.,"Of flowers whereof, aye, more and more,"
496,SERAPHITUS.,The world begetteth a sad dearth;
497,SERAPHITUS.,"And those rare balms man searcheth for,"
498,SERAPHITUS.,"Fair ecstasy, and the soul’s mirth:"
499,SERAPHITUS.,Half grudgingly the angels bore
500,SERAPHITUS.,That one should waste on a lost earth
501,SERAPHITUS.,Things of such worth.
502,SERAPHITUS.,
503,SERAPHITUS.,"It may be, with a strange delight,"
504,SERAPHITUS.,After an age of gazing through
505,SERAPHITUS.,That mirror of things infinite
506,SERAPHITUS.,That well nigh burns the veil of blue
507,SERAPHITUS.,Drawn down between it and our sight--
508,SERAPHITUS.,"It may be, with a joy all new,"
509,SERAPHITUS.,He sought the darkness and the light
510,SERAPHITUS.,Of day and night.
511,SERAPHITUS.,
512,SERAPHITUS.,"It may be, that, upon some wave"
513,SERAPHITUS.,Which through the incense-laden skies
514,SERAPHITUS.,"Scarce forced its ripple, there once clave"
515,SERAPHITUS.,A thin earth-fragrance--in such wise
516,SERAPHITUS.,It smote his sense and made him crave
517,SERAPHITUS.,"For that strange sweet: maybe, likewise,"
518,SERAPHITUS.,The leaves their subtle perfume gave
519,SERAPHITUS.,Up from some grave:
520,SERAPHITUS.,
521,SERAPHITUS.,And pleasant did it seem to heap
522,SERAPHITUS.,About the heart dim spells that lull
523,SERAPHITUS.,"Profoundly between death and sleep,"
524,SERAPHITUS.,"To feel mid earthly soothings, dull"
525,SERAPHITUS.,"And sweet, upon the whole sense creep"
526,SERAPHITUS.,"The dream--life-long and wonderful,"
527,SERAPHITUS.,That hath all souls of men to keep
528,SERAPHITUS.,Lest they should weep.
529,SERAPHITUS.,
530,SERAPHITUS.,"But often, when there seemed to fall"
531,SERAPHITUS.,"Bright shadows of half-blindness, thin,"
532,SERAPHITUS.,And like fine films wrought over all
533,SERAPHITUS.,The flashing sights of Heaven within;
534,SERAPHITUS.,While that fair perishable wall
535,SERAPHITUS.,Of flesh so barred and shut him in
536,SERAPHITUS.,That scarce a silver spirit-call
537,SERAPHITUS.,Reached him at all--
538,SERAPHITUS.,
539,SERAPHITUS.,"O then the Earth failed not to bring,"
540,SERAPHITUS.,Indeed through many a day and eve--
541,SERAPHITUS.,The strength of all her flowering
542,SERAPHITUS.,"About him; nor forgot to weave,"
543,SERAPHITUS.,"With soft perpetual murmuring,"
544,SERAPHITUS.,"Her spells, that such a sweet way grieve,"
545,SERAPHITUS.,"And hold the heart to each fair thing,"
546,SERAPHITUS.,"Yea, with a sting:"
547,SERAPHITUS.,
548,SERAPHITUS.,"And, sometimes, with strange prevalence"
549,SERAPHITUS.,He felt those dim enchantments float
550,SERAPHITUS.,Most soothingly upon his sense;
551,SERAPHITUS.,"While faint in memory remote,"
552,SERAPHITUS.,"Brought down the heart knew not from whence,"
553,SERAPHITUS.,The thought of heaven within him smote--
554,SERAPHITUS.,And many a yearning did commence
555,SERAPHITUS.,Vague and intense--
556,SERAPHITUS.,
557,SERAPHITUS.,Fair part of that unknown disease
558,SERAPHITUS.,"Of dull material love, whereby"
559,SERAPHITUS.,The luring flower-semblances
560,SERAPHITUS.,Of earthliness and death would try
561,SERAPHITUS.,To bind his heart beyond release
562,SERAPHITUS.,"To each fair mortal sympathy,"
563,SERAPHITUS.,That Death at length might wholly seize
564,SERAPHITUS.,Him with all these.
565,SERAPHITUS.,
566,SERAPHITUS.,"And, surely, on some shining bed"
567,SERAPHITUS.,Of flowers in full summer’s gleam;
568,SERAPHITUS.,Or when the autumn time had shed
569,SERAPHITUS.,Its wealth of perfume and its dream
570,SERAPHITUS.,On some rich eve--no thing of dread
571,SERAPHITUS.,"To all his spirit did it seem,"
572,SERAPHITUS.,"To dream on, feeling sweet earth spread"
573,SERAPHITUS.,Over his head.
574,SERAPHITUS.,
575,SERAPHITUS.,*       *       *       *       *
576,SERAPHITUS.,
577,SERAPHITUS.,"But, one long twilight--hushed and dim--"
578,SERAPHITUS.,The blue unfathomable clime
579,SERAPHITUS.,Of heaven seemed wholly to o’erbrim
580,SERAPHITUS.,With presence of the Lord--sublime;
581,SERAPHITUS.,And voices of the Seraphim
582,SERAPHITUS.,Fell through the ether like a chime:
583,SERAPHITUS.,He rose: his past way seemed to him
584,SERAPHITUS.,Like a child’s whim.
585,SERAPHITUS.,
586,SERAPHITUS.,
587,SERAPHITUS.,
588,SERAPHITUS.,
589,THE LOVER.,THE LOVER.
590,THE LOVER.,
591,THE LOVER.,
592,THE LOVER.,I was not with the rest at play;
593,THE LOVER.,My brothers laughed in joyous mood:
594,THE LOVER.,But I--I wandered far away
595,THE LOVER.,Into the fair and silent wood;
596,THE LOVER.,"And with the trees and flowers I stood,"
597,THE LOVER.,As dumb and full of dreams as they:
598,THE LOVER.,"--For One it seemed my whole heart knew,"
599,THE LOVER.,"Or One my heart had known long since,"
600,THE LOVER.,Was peeping at me through the dew;
601,THE LOVER.,And with bright laughter seemed to woo
602,THE LOVER.,"My beauty, like a Fairy prince."
603,THE LOVER.,
604,THE LOVER.,"Oh, what a soft enchantment filled"
605,THE LOVER.,The lonely paths and places dim!
606,THE LOVER.,"It was as though the whole wood thrilled,"
607,THE LOVER.,"And a dumb joy, because of him,"
608,THE LOVER.,"Weighed down the lilies tall and slim,"
609,THE LOVER.,"And made the roses blush, and stilled"
610,THE LOVER.,The great wild voices in half fear:
611,THE LOVER.,It was as though his smile did hold
612,THE LOVER.,All things in trances manifold;
613,THE LOVER.,And in each place as he drew near
614,THE LOVER.,The leaves were touched and turned to gold.
615,THE LOVER.,
616,THE LOVER.,"And well I seemed to know, the while,"
617,THE LOVER.,"It was for me and for my sake,"
618,THE LOVER.,"He wrought that magic with his smile,"
619,THE LOVER.,And set the unseen spells to make
620,THE LOVER.,The lonely ways I loved to take
621,THE LOVER.,"So full of sweetness, to beguile"
622,THE LOVER.,My heart and keep me there for hours;
623,THE LOVER.,And sometimes I was sure he lay
624,THE LOVER.,"Beside me hid among the flowers,"
625,THE LOVER.,"Or climbed above me, and in play"
626,THE LOVER.,Shook down the white tree-bloom in showers.
627,THE LOVER.,
628,THE LOVER.,But more and more he seemed to seek
629,THE LOVER.,"My heart: till, dreaming of all this,"
630,THE LOVER.,"I thought one day to hear him speak,"
631,THE LOVER.,"Or feel, indeed, his sudden kiss"
632,THE LOVER.,Bind me to some great unknown bliss:
633,THE LOVER.,Then there would stay upon my cheek
634,THE LOVER.,"Full many a light and honied stain,"
635,THE LOVER.,That told indeed how I had lain
636,THE LOVER.,Deep in the flowery banks all day;
637,THE LOVER.,And round me too there would remain
638,THE LOVER.,Some strange wood-blossom’s scent alway.
639,THE LOVER.,
640,THE LOVER.,’Twas not the bright and fond deceit
641,THE LOVER.,"Of that first summer,--whose great bloom"
642,THE LOVER.,"Quite overcame me with its sweet,"
643,THE LOVER.,And seemed to fill me and consume
644,THE LOVER.,My very brain with its perfume;--
645,THE LOVER.,’Twas no false spell made my heart beat
646,THE LOVER.,With such a joy to be alone
647,THE LOVER.,With all the bloom and all the scent:
648,THE LOVER.,"It was a thing I dared not own,"
649,THE LOVER.,"Already whispered there and known,"
650,THE LOVER.,Already with my whole life blent.
651,THE LOVER.,
652,THE LOVER.,"It was this secret, vast, sublime,"
653,THE LOVER.,Too full of wonder to be told--
654,THE LOVER.,Whose extreme rapture from that time
655,THE LOVER.,Doth ever more and more enfold
656,THE LOVER.,"My spirit, like a robe of gold,"
657,THE LOVER.,"Or, as it were, the magic clime"
658,THE LOVER.,Of some fair heaven about me shed--
659,THE LOVER.,"Wherein are songs of unseen birds,"
660,THE LOVER.,And whispers of delicious words
661,THE LOVER.,More sweet than any man hath said
662,THE LOVER.,Of all the living or the dead.
663,THE LOVER.,
664,THE LOVER.,"--O, the incomparable love"
665,THE LOVER.,"Of him, my Lover!--O, to tell"
666,THE LOVER.,Its way and measure were above
667,THE LOVER.,The throbbing chords of speech that swell
668,THE LOVER.,Within me!--Doth it not excel
669,THE LOVER.,"All other, sung or written of?"
670,THE LOVER.,"Yea now, O all ye fair mankind--"
671,THE LOVER.,Consider well the gracious line
672,THE LOVER.,Of those your lovers; call to mind
673,THE LOVER.,"Their love of you, and ye shall find"
674,THE LOVER.,Not one among them all like mine.
675,THE LOVER.,
676,THE LOVER.,"It seems as though, from calm to calm,"
677,THE LOVER.,"A whole fair age had passed me by,"
678,THE LOVER.,"Since first this Lover, through a charm"
679,THE LOVER.,"Of flowers, wooed so tenderly,"
680,THE LOVER.,"I had no fear of drawing nigh,"
681,THE LOVER.,"Nor knew, indeed, that--with an arm"
682,THE LOVER.,Closed round and holding me--he led
683,THE LOVER.,My eager way from sight to sight
684,THE LOVER.,Of all the summer magic--right
685,THE LOVER.,To where himself had surely spread
686,THE LOVER.,Some pleasant snare for my delight.
687,THE LOVER.,
688,THE LOVER.,"And now, in an eternal sphere,"
689,THE LOVER.,Beneath one flooding look of his--
690,THE LOVER.,"Wherein, all beautiful and dear,"
691,THE LOVER.,That endless melting gold that is
692,THE LOVER.,"His love, with flawless memories"
693,THE LOVER.,Grows ever richer and more clear--
694,THE LOVER.,"My life seems held, as some faint star"
695,THE LOVER.,Beneath its sun: and through the far
696,THE LOVER.,"Celestial distances for miles,"
697,THE LOVER.,"To where vast mirage futures are,"
698,THE LOVER.,I trace the gilding of his smiles.
699,THE LOVER.,
700,THE LOVER.,"And, in the long enthralling dream,"
701,THE LOVER.,"That, ever--through each purer zone"
702,THE LOVER.,Of love translating me--doth seem
703,THE LOVER.,"To bring my spirit near his own,"
704,THE LOVER.,I hear the veiled angelic tone
705,THE LOVER.,"Of many voices; as I deem,"
706,THE LOVER.,"Assuring me of something sweet,"
707,THE LOVER.,"And strange, and wondrous, and intense;"
708,THE LOVER.,Which thing they evermore repeat
709,THE LOVER.,"In fair half parables, from whence"
710,THE LOVER.,I draw a vague all-blissful sense.
711,THE LOVER.,
712,THE LOVER.,"For, one by one, e’en as I rise,"
713,THE LOVER.,And feel the pure Ethereal
714,THE LOVER.,Refining all before my eyes:
715,THE LOVER.,Whole beauteous worlds material
716,THE LOVER.,Are seen to enter gradual
717,THE LOVER.,The great transparent paradise
718,THE LOVER.,"Of this my dream; and, all revealed,"
719,THE LOVER.,To break upon me more and more
720,THE LOVER.,"Their inward singing souls, and yield"
721,THE LOVER.,A wondrous secret half concealed
722,THE LOVER.,In all their loveliness before.
723,THE LOVER.,
724,THE LOVER.,"And so, when, through unmeasured days,"
725,THE LOVER.,The far effulgence of the sea
726,THE LOVER.,"Is holding me in long amaze,"
727,THE LOVER.,And stealing with strange ecstasy
728,THE LOVER.,My heart all opened silently;--
729,THE LOVER.,"There reach me, from among the sprays,"
730,THE LOVER.,Ineffable faint words that sing
731,THE LOVER.,"Within me,--how, for me alone,"
732,THE LOVER.,"One who is lover--who is King,"
733,THE LOVER.,"Hath dropt, as ’twere a precious stone,"
734,THE LOVER.,That sea--a symbol of his throne.
735,THE LOVER.,
736,THE LOVER.,"And now, indeed, some precious time"
737,THE LOVER.,"It hath,--all inexpressible!"
738,THE LOVER.,"All rapture!--yea, through many a rhyme"
739,THE LOVER.,"Of wordless speech made fairly well,"
740,THE LOVER.,And beauteous worlds’ whole visible
741,THE LOVER.,Unbosomings of love sublime--
742,THE LOVER.,It hath some blessèd while become
743,THE LOVER.,"Familiar, how all things take part"
744,THE LOVER.,"For him to whose love I am come,"
745,THE LOVER.,And in their ways--not weak nor dumb--
746,THE LOVER.,Are ever calling on my heart.
747,THE LOVER.,
748,THE LOVER.,"And, through the long charmed solitude"
749,THE LOVER.,"Of throbbing moments, whose strong link"
750,THE LOVER.,Is one delicious hope pursued
751,THE LOVER.,"From trance to trance, the while I think"
752,THE LOVER.,And know myself upon the brink
753,THE LOVER.,"Of His eternal kiss,--endued"
754,THE LOVER.,"With part of him, the very wind"
755,THE LOVER.,Hath power to ravish me in sips
756,THE LOVER.,Or long mad wooings that unbind
757,THE LOVER.,"My hair,--wherein I truly find"
758,THE LOVER.,The magic of his unseen lips.
759,THE LOVER.,
760,THE LOVER.,"And, so almighty is the thrill"
761,THE LOVER.,I feel at many a faintest breath
762,THE LOVER.,Or stir of sound--as ’twere a rill
763,THE LOVER.,"Of joy traversing me, or death"
764,THE LOVER.,Dissolving all that hindereth
765,THE LOVER.,My thought from power to fulfil
766,THE LOVER.,"Some new embodiment of bliss,--"
767,THE LOVER.,I do consume with the immense
768,THE LOVER.,"Delight as of some secret kiss,"
769,THE LOVER.,And am become like one whose sense
770,THE LOVER.,Is used with raptures too intense!
771,THE LOVER.,
772,THE LOVER.,"O like some soft insidious breath,"
773,THE LOVER.,Whose first invasion winneth quite
774,THE LOVER.,To all its madness or its death
775,THE LOVER.,"The heart, resisting not the might"
776,THE LOVER.,"And poison of its new delight,--"
777,THE LOVER.,E’en so is this that entereth
778,THE LOVER.,"In whispers, or through subtly wrought"
779,THE LOVER.,Enchantment snaring every thought;
780,THE LOVER.,"Yea, by the whole mysterious pore"
781,THE LOVER.,"Of life,--this joy surpassing aught"
782,THE LOVER.,That heart of man hath known before.
783,THE LOVER.,
784,THE LOVER.,"And, though, indeed, a hapless end"
785,THE LOVER.,"Of damning ruin were but sure,"
786,THE LOVER.,Yet could I none of me defend
787,THE LOVER.,From such a sweet and perfect lure;
788,THE LOVER.,"But must, as long as they endure,"
789,THE LOVER.,To all these sorceries still lend
790,THE LOVER.,My heart; believing how I stand
791,THE LOVER.,Nigh some unearthly bliss that lies
792,THE LOVER.,Dissembled all before my eyes;--
793,THE LOVER.,Do I not see a radiant Hand
794,THE LOVER.,"Transmuting earth, and air, and skies?"
795,THE LOVER.,
796,THE LOVER.,--And is not the great language mute
797,THE LOVER.,The stars’ deep looks are wont to melt
798,THE LOVER.,"Upon my soul, the very suit"
799,THE LOVER.,Of this unearthly wooer--felt
800,THE LOVER.,So clearly pleading--I have knelt
801,THE LOVER.,"Full oft, most dreading to pollute"
802,THE LOVER.,The holy rapture with a sigh?
803,THE LOVER.,And doth not every accent nigh
804,THE LOVER.,Consume each Past to a thin shred;
805,THE LOVER.,While endless visions glorify
806,THE LOVER.,"My sight, and haloes touch my head?"
807,THE LOVER.,
808,THE LOVER.,"Yea, mystic consummation! yea,"
809,THE LOVER.,"O Wondrous suitor,--whosoe’er"
810,THE LOVER.,"Thou art; that in such mighty way,"
811,THE LOVER.,"In distant realms, athwart the air"
812,THE LOVER.,"And lands and seas, with all things fair,"
813,THE LOVER.,Hast wooed me even till this day;--
814,THE LOVER.,It seems thou drawest near to me;
815,THE LOVER.,"Or I, indeed, so nigh to thee,"
816,THE LOVER.,I catch rare breaths of a delight
817,THE LOVER.,"From thy most glorious country, see"
818,THE LOVER.,Its distant glow upon some height.
819,THE LOVER.,
820,THE LOVER.,"At times there is vouchsafed me, e’en"
821,THE LOVER.,Some sign that certainly foretells
822,THE LOVER.,Of thee at hand: so I have seen--
823,THE LOVER.,Caught by no earthly clash of bells--
824,THE LOVER.,A gleam of silver citadels;
825,THE LOVER.,"Distant, and radiant with such sheen"
826,THE LOVER.,"As only on high virgin snows,"
827,THE LOVER.,Or from the diamond one knows;
828,THE LOVER.,"Displayed a moment, without shroud,"
829,THE LOVER.,Eclipsing all the night’s fair shows
830,THE LOVER.,From some dim pinnacle of cloud:
831,THE LOVER.,
832,THE LOVER.,"Or, through a calm hushed interval"
833,THE LOVER.,"Of most charmed thinking, there hath passed,"
834,THE LOVER.,"And with no rumour or footfall,"
835,THE LOVER.,A troop of blonde ones who surpassed
836,THE LOVER.,All tales of loveliness amassed
837,THE LOVER.,In my child’s dreamland; costumed all
838,THE LOVER.,As for a bridal; who did shine
839,THE LOVER.,"With such a splendour on each face,"
840,THE LOVER.,"And light upon the garments fine,"
841,THE LOVER.,I knew them surely of a race
842,THE LOVER.,That dwells in that fair realm of thine.
843,THE LOVER.,
844,THE LOVER.,O thou my Destiny! O thou
845,THE LOVER.,My own--my very Love--my Lord!
846,THE LOVER.,Whom from the first day until now
847,THE LOVER.,"My heart, divining, hath adored"
848,THE LOVER.,So perfectly it hath abhorred
849,THE LOVER.,The tie of each frail human vow--
850,THE LOVER.,O I would whisper in thine ear--
851,THE LOVER.,"Yea, may I not, once, in the clear"
852,THE LOVER.,"Pure night, when, only, silver shod"
853,THE LOVER.,"The angels walk?--thy name, I fear"
854,THE LOVER.,"And love, and tremble saying--GOD!"

892,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Wherein she pours me forth her soul,"
893,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,And bids me drink it for her sake.
894,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
895,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Methinks the world becomes an isle;
896,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"And there--immortal, as it seems--"
897,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"I gaze upon her face, whose smile"

906,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"And heedlessly, athwart my mirth,"
907,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,I see Death digging day by day
908,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"A grave; and, very far away,"

912,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Thou Death!--I say--keep in thy shade;
913,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Crouch down behind the willow tree,"
914,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Lest thou shouldst make my love afraid;
915,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"If thou hast aught with me, pale friend,"
916,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Some flitting leaf its sigh shall lend
917,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,To tell me when the grave is made!
918,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
919,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"And lo, e’en while I now rejoice,"
920,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Encircled by my love’s fair arm,"
921,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"There cometh up to me a voice,"
922,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Yea, through the fragrance and the charm;"
923,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Quite like some sigh the forest heaves
924,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Quite soft--a murmur of dead leaves,"
925,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,And not a voice that bodeth harm:
926,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
927,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"O lover, fear not--have thou joy;"
928,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,For life and love are in thy hands:
929,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,I seek in no wise to destroy
930,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"The peace thou hast, nor make the sands"
931,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Run quicker through thy pleasant span;
932,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Blest art thou above many a man,"
933,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,And fair is She who with thee stands:
934,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
935,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,I only keep for thee out here--
936,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"O far away, as thou hast said,"
937,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Among the willow trees--a clear
938,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Soft space for slumber, and a bed;"
939,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"That after all, if life be vain,"
940,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"And love turn at the last to pain,"
941,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Thou mayst have ease when thou art dead.
942,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
943,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,O grieve not: back to thy love’s lips
944,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Let her embrace thee more and more,"
945,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Consume that sweet of hers in sips:
946,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,I only wait till it is o’er;
947,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"For fear thou’lt weary of her kiss,"
948,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,And come to need a bed like this
949,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Where none shall kiss thee evermore.
950,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
951,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Believe each pleasant muttered vow
952,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"She makes to thee, and see with ease"
953,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Each promised heaven before thee now;
954,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"I only think, if one of these"
955,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Should fail thee--O thou wouldst need then
956,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"To come away right far from men,"
957,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,And weep beneath the willow trees.
958,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
959,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"And, therefore, have I made this place,"
960,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Where thou shouldst come on that hard day,"
961,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Full of a sad and weary grace;
962,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,For here the drear wind hath its way
963,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"With grass, and flowers, and withered tree--"
964,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"As sorrow shall that day with thee,"
965,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,If it should happen as I say.
966,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
967,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"And, therefore, have I kept the ground,"
968,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"As ’twere quite holy, year by year;"
969,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,The great wind lowers to a sound
970,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Of sighing as it passes near;
971,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,And seldom doth a man intrude
972,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Upon the hallowed solitude,"
973,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,And never but to shed a tear.
974,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
975,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"So, if it be thou come, alas,"
976,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"For sake of sorrow long and deep,"
977,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"I--Death, the flowers, and leaves, and grass--"
978,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Thy grief-fellows, do mourn and weep:"
979,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Or if thou come, with life’s whole need"
980,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"To rest a life-long space indeed,"
981,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,I too and they do guard thy sleep.
982,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
983,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Moreover, sometimes, while all we"
984,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Have kept the grave with heaviness,"
985,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,The weary place hath seemed to be
986,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Not barren of all blessedness:
987,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Spent sunbeams rest them here at noon,"
988,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,And grieving spirits from the moon
989,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Walk here at night in shining dress.
990,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
991,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,And there is gazing down on all
992,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Some great and love-like eye of blue,"
993,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Wherefrom, at times, there seem to fall"
994,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,Strange looks that soothe the place quite through;
995,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"As though indeed, if all love’s sweet"
996,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"And all life’s good should prove a cheat,"
997,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,They knew some heaven that might be true.
998,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,
999,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,--It is a tender voice like this
1000,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,That comes to me in accents fair:
1001,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Well; and through much of love and bliss,"
1002,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,It seemeth not a thing quite bare
1003,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Of comfort, e’en to be possest"
1004,A WHISPER FROM THE GRAVE.,"Of that one spot of earth for rest,"

1123,BISCLAVARET.,"Now through the mountain clouds they break,"

1131,BISCLAVARET.,And all into the whirlwind lift
1132,BISCLAVARET.,
1133,BISCLAVARET.,The heavy sinking slopes of shade
1134,BISCLAVARET.,"From hidden hills of monstrous girth,"

1143,BISCLAVARET.,The beadsman in his lonely cell
1144,BISCLAVARET.,Hath cast one boding timorous look

1148,BISCLAVARET.,"All night he prayeth in one breath,"

1158,BISCLAVARET.,"And us indeed no common arm,"

1160,BISCLAVARET.,"But, through all elements of harm,"
1161,BISCLAVARET.,Across the strange fields of the night--
1162,BISCLAVARET.,
1163,BISCLAVARET.,Enrolled with the whole giant host
1164,BISCLAVARET.,"Of shadowy, cloud-outstripping things"

1173,BISCLAVARET.,"And loud, mid fearful echoings,"

1178,BISCLAVARET.,Revealed and perfected at length
1179,BISCLAVARET.,"In whole and dire transfigurement,"
1180,BISCLAVARET.,With miracle of growing strength
1181,BISCLAVARET.,We win upon a keen warm scent.
1182,BISCLAVARET.,
1183,BISCLAVARET.,Before us each cloud fastness breaks;
1184,BISCLAVARET.,"And o’er slant inward wastes of light,"
1185,BISCLAVARET.,"And past the moving mirage lakes,"
1186,BISCLAVARET.,And on within the Lord’s own sight--
1187,BISCLAVARET.,
1188,BISCLAVARET.,We hunt the chosen of the Lord;
1189,BISCLAVARET.,"And cease not, in wild course elate,"

1191,BISCLAVARET.,And Gabriel before His gate!

1194,BISCLAVARET.,Falls bitterly beneath our chase;
1195,BISCLAVARET.,"And no man till the judgment day,"
1196,BISCLAVARET.,Hath power to give these burial place;
1197,BISCLAVARET.,
1198,BISCLAVARET.,But down in many a stricken home
1199,BISCLAVARET.,"About the world, for these they mourn;"
1200,BISCLAVARET.,And seek them yet through Christendom
1201,BISCLAVARET.,In all the lands where they were born.
1202,BISCLAVARET.,
1203,BISCLAVARET.,"And oft, when Hell’s dread prevalence"

1208,BISCLAVARET.,We hear the new and piercing wail;
1209,BISCLAVARET.,"And, through the haunted day’s long glare,"
1210,BISCLAVARET.,In fearful lassitudes turn pale
1211,BISCLAVARET.,With thought of all the curse we bear.
1212,BISCLAVARET.,
1213,BISCLAVARET.,"But, for long seasons of the moon,"

1216,BISCLAVARET.,"Beneath the close grip of the snow,"

1218,BISCLAVARET.,We well nigh cheat the hideous spells

1334,THE STORY OF THE KING.,Lonely it is I trow:

1411,PALM FLOWERS.,"In thick green, and voices call"
1412,PALM FLOWERS.,
1413,PALM FLOWERS.,"From the hidden forest places,"
1414,PALM FLOWERS.,And are answered with strange shout

1418,PALM FLOWERS.,From shy loopholes all above us

1442,PALM FLOWERS.,
1443,PALM FLOWERS.,"Strangely, with a mighty hushing,"
1444,PALM FLOWERS.,Falls the sudden hour of noon;
1445,PALM FLOWERS.,"When the flowers droop with blushing,"
1446,PALM FLOWERS.,And a deep miraculous swoon
1447,PALM FLOWERS.,
1448,PALM FLOWERS.,Seems subduing the whole forest;
1449,PALM FLOWERS.,Or some distant joyous rite
1450,PALM FLOWERS.,Draws away each bright-hued chorist:
1451,PALM FLOWERS.,Then we yield with long delight
1452,PALM FLOWERS.,
1453,PALM FLOWERS.,"Each to each, our souls deep thirsting;"
1454,PALM FLOWERS.,"And no sound at all is nigh,"
1455,PALM FLOWERS.,Save from time to time the bursting
1456,PALM FLOWERS.,Of some fire-fed fruit on high.
1457,PALM FLOWERS.,
1458,PALM FLOWERS.,Then with sudden overshrouding
1459,PALM FLOWERS.,"Of impenetrable wings,"
1460,PALM FLOWERS.,Comes the darkness and the crowding
1461,PALM FLOWERS.,Mysteries of the unseen things.
1462,PALM FLOWERS.,
1463,PALM FLOWERS.,O how happy are we lovers
1464,PALM FLOWERS.,In weak wanderings hand in hand!--
1465,PALM FLOWERS.,Whom the immense palm forest covers
1466,PALM FLOWERS.,In that strange enchanted land;
1467,PALM FLOWERS.,
1468,PALM FLOWERS.,Whom its thousand sights stupendous

1475,PALM FLOWERS.,"We, who see all things preparing"
1476,PALM FLOWERS.,Some Great Spirit’s world for him!
1477,PALM FLOWERS.,
1478,PALM FLOWERS.,Under pomps and splendid glamour
1479,PALM FLOWERS.,Of the night skies limitless;
1480,PALM FLOWERS.,Through the weird and growing clamour
1481,PALM FLOWERS.,Of the swaying wilderness;
1482,PALM FLOWERS.,
1483,PALM FLOWERS.,Through each shock of sound that shivers
1484,PALM FLOWERS.,"The serene palms to their height,"

1486,PALM FLOWERS.,Launched with foam athwart the night;
1487,PALM FLOWERS.,
1488,PALM FLOWERS.,"Lost and safe amid such wonders,"
1489,PALM FLOWERS.,We prolong our human bliss;
1490,PALM FLOWERS.,Drown the terrors of the thunders
1491,PALM FLOWERS.,In the rapture of our kiss.
1492,PALM FLOWERS.,
1493,PALM FLOWERS.,"By some moon-haunted savanna,"

1497,PALM FLOWERS.,
1498,PALM FLOWERS.,O’er our heads the squadron dances
1499,PALM FLOWERS.,Of the fire-fly wheel and poise;

1503,PALM FLOWERS.,Till around us creeps the early
1504,PALM FLOWERS.,"Sweet discordance of the dawn,"
1505,PALM FLOWERS.,"And the moonlight pales, and pearly"

1549,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"He took from the sun gold and made her hair,"

1551,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1552,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"He sought in every precious place and store,"
1553,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,And gathered all sweet essences that are

1555,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"Her body, the most beautiful by far."
1556,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1557,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"Pure coral with pure pearl engendering,"

1564,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"Made of sun, sky, and sea,--more fair than they--"
1565,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,On the green margin of the sea she stood.
1566,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1567,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"The coral colour lasted in her veins,"
1568,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,Made her lips rosy like a sea-shell’s rims;
1569,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"The purple stained her cheeks with splendid stains,"
1570,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,And the pearl’s colour clung upon her limbs.
1571,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1572,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,She took her golden hair between her hands;
1573,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,The faded gold and amber of the seas
1574,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,Dropped from it in a shower upon the sands;

1577,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"And through the threads of it the sun lost gold,"
1578,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,And fell all pale upon her throat and breast

1596,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1597,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,The waves fell fawning all about her there
1598,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"Down to her ancles; then, with kissing sweet,"
1599,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,Slackened and waned away in love and fear
1600,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,From the bright presence of her new-formed feet.
1601,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1602,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,The green-gray mists were gathering away
1603,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,In distant hollows underneath the sun

1611,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1612,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"And ere a man could see her with desire,"
1613,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"Himself looked on her so, and loved her first,"
1614,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"And came upon her in a mist, like fire,"
1615,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,And of her beauty quenched his god-like thirst.
1616,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1617,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"He touched her wholly with his naked soul,"
1618,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,At once sufficing all the new-made sense
1619,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,For ever: so the Giver Himself stole

1621,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1622,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,All lavishly at first He did entreat
1623,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"His leman; yea, the world of things create"
1624,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"He rolled like any jewel at her feet,"
1625,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,And of her changeful whim He made a fate.
1626,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1627,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,He feasted her with ease and idle food
1628,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"Of gods, and taught her lusts to fill the whole"
1629,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"Of life; withal He gave her nothing good,"
1630,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,And left her as He made her--without soul.
1631,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,
1632,BOCCACCIO: DE CLARIS MULIERIBUS.,"And lo, when he had held her for a season"

1693,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,In every palace of the painless gods.
1694,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1695,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,He had no part but wholly to upbraid
1696,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Them,--meters of his evil measured fate,"
1697,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Who first made fair, then spoiled the thing they made,"
1698,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,And mingled all their gifts with love and hate.
1699,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1700,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Yet he was moved at length some way to win
1701,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Vengeance, and all at once, on her and Him--"
1702,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,That god with whom she rather chose to sin
1703,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Than with a man to love: when earth was dim--
1704,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1705,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Full of unearthly shadows in the night,"
1706,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,He came upon those lovers unaware;
1707,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,And fairly caught them locked in their delight:
1708,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Limb over limb he bound them in a snare.
1709,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1710,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,For first with all his craft he did invent
1711,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"A curious toil of meshes, strongly set"
1712,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,With supple fibrous thread and branches bent:
1713,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Full tightly they were bounden in that net.
1714,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1715,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Yet, not until with many a growing gray"
1716,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"And change that wrought among the shifting shade,"
1717,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Day--softly changing all things--warned away
1718,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Their loves and sins, knew they the fate they had."
1719,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1720,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,And when they were but striving to undo
1721,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Delicious bonds of love that needs no chain,"
1722,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Then were they held:--though love had let them go
1723,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,A stronger bond than love’s bade them remain.
1724,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1725,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"And, spite of many a throe of sudden strength,"
1726,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,And all their tortuous striving to be free;
1727,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Yea, they were held:--till the sun came at length,"
1728,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,And all the gods came out of heaven to see.
1729,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1730,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"For there they saw and knew Him from afar,"
1731,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Vanquished and in no honourable plight,"
1732,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"No less a god than Ares god of war,"
1733,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Ares the red and royal in all fight;
1734,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1735,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"But now quite shorn indeed of arms and fame,"
1736,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Spoiled of his helm and harness of each limb;
1737,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Yea, quite inglorious and brought to shame"
1738,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"For a mere love, with such rude stratagem!"
1739,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1740,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,The golden peals of god-like laughter brake
1741,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,And rang down beautiful beneath the sun;
1742,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"For well they saw, indeed, for whose fair sake"
1743,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Their brother was so fallen and undone.
1744,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1745,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Phœbus himself, with many a secret pride"
1746,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Of love--unshamed in any of his loves--
1747,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Leant on his golden bow, and laughed aside,"
1748,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,And made some fair light saying that still moves
1749,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1750,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,From lips to lips at all the mirthful feasts
1751,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Of them above who have eternal rights
1752,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"To joys and loves, and wine that never wastes,"
1753,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,And life never to end their days or nights.
1754,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1755,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"And well they knew Hephæstus where, hard by,"
1756,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"He stood, inglorious, daring all their eyes:"
1757,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,The gods all beautiful--they laughed on high
1758,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"At him, his woes and all his blasphemies."
1759,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1760,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,But surely never was there such a play
1761,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,For mirth of idle gods!--Nor such a shame
1762,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Ever become of love, as on that day"
1763,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,In sight of all the gods their love became!
1764,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1765,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Who were betrayed so,--in whatever sin"
1766,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Lips could with lips, face could with face commit,"
1767,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Yea lips or limbs of lovers could begin,--"
1768,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,That they were bound and kept quite close in it:
1769,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1770,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,For vainly in the meshes of that snare
1771,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"They strove, with shuddering limbs and starting cries,"
1772,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Entangled more with many a mesh of hair
1773,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Caught in the manifold intricacies!
1774,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1775,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"So She was found indeed most beautiful,"
1776,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,Yet full of shame and false in all she was;
1777,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"So before gods who make and gods who rule,"
1778,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"And him her husband, she was found, alas!"
1779,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,
1780,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Yet, after all, Hephæstus--he, her lord--"
1781,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"For all that sin, her death he would not have;"
1782,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"But, for his love’s sake and great Phœbus’ word,"
1783,THE WIFE OF HEPHÆSTUS.,"Loosed her, and made her free, and all forgave."

1794,CLEOPATRA.,"Cleopatra Egyptia femina fuit, totius orbis fabula."
1795,CLEOPATRA.,
1796,CLEOPATRA.,
1797,CLEOPATRA.,She made a feast for great Marc Antony:
1798,CLEOPATRA.,Her galley was arrayed in gold and light;
1799,CLEOPATRA.,"That evening, in the purple sea and sky,"
1800,CLEOPATRA.,It shone green-golden like a chrysolite.
1801,CLEOPATRA.,
1802,CLEOPATRA.,She was reclined upon a Tyrian couch
1803,CLEOPATRA.,Of crimson wools: out of her loosened vest
1804,CLEOPATRA.,Set on one shoulder with a serpent brooch
1805,CLEOPATRA.,Fell one arm white and half her foamy breast.
1806,CLEOPATRA.,
1807,CLEOPATRA.,"And, with the breath of many a fanning plume,"
1808,CLEOPATRA.,That wonder of her hair that was like wine--
1809,CLEOPATRA.,"Of mingled fires and purples that consume,"
1810,CLEOPATRA.,Moved all its mystery of threads most fine--
1811,CLEOPATRA.,
1812,CLEOPATRA.,"Moved like some threaded instrument that thrills,"
1813,CLEOPATRA.,Played on with unseen kisses in the air
1814,CLEOPATRA.,"Weaving a music from it, working spells"
1815,CLEOPATRA.,We feel and know not of--so moved her hair:
1816,CLEOPATRA.,
1817,CLEOPATRA.,And under saffron canopies all bright
1818,CLEOPATRA.,"With clash of lights, e’en to the amber prow,"
1819,CLEOPATRA.,"Crept like enchantments subtle passing sight,"
1820,CLEOPATRA.,Fragrance and siren music soft and slow.
1821,CLEOPATRA.,
1822,CLEOPATRA.,"Amid the thousand viands of the feast,"
1823,CLEOPATRA.,"And Nile fruits piled in panniers, where they vied"
1824,CLEOPATRA.,"With palm-tree dates and melons of the East,"
1825,CLEOPATRA.,She waited for Marc Antony and sighed.
1826,CLEOPATRA.,
1827,CLEOPATRA.,--Where tarries he?--What gift doth he invent
1828,CLEOPATRA.,"For costly greeting?--How with look or smile,"
1829,CLEOPATRA.,Out of love treasures not already spent
1830,CLEOPATRA.,Prepares he now her fondness to beguile?
1831,CLEOPATRA.,
1832,CLEOPATRA.,"--But lo, he came between the whiles she sighed;"
1833,CLEOPATRA.,"Scarce the wave murmurs troubling,--lo, most dear,"
1834,CLEOPATRA.,"His galley, with the oars all softly plied,"
1835,CLEOPATRA.,"Warned her with music distant, and drew near."
1836,CLEOPATRA.,
1837,CLEOPATRA.,"And on that night--for present,--he did bring"
1838,CLEOPATRA.,A pearl; and gave it her with kissing sweet:
1839,CLEOPATRA.,"“Would half the Roman empires were this thing,”"
1840,CLEOPATRA.,"He said, “that I might lay them at your feet.”"
1841,CLEOPATRA.,
1842,CLEOPATRA.,Fairly then moved the magic all arrayed
1843,CLEOPATRA.,About that fragrant feast; in every part
1844,CLEOPATRA.,The soft Egyptian spells did lend their aid
1845,CLEOPATRA.,To work some strange enamouring of the heart.
1846,CLEOPATRA.,
1847,CLEOPATRA.,It was her whim to show him on that night
1848,CLEOPATRA.,"All she was queen of; like a perfect dream,"
1849,CLEOPATRA.,Wherein there should be gathered in one sight
1850,CLEOPATRA.,"The gold of many lives, as it might seem"
1851,CLEOPATRA.,
1852,CLEOPATRA.,"Spent and lived through at once,--so she made pass"
1853,CLEOPATRA.,A splendid pageantry of all her East
1854,CLEOPATRA.,"Beauteous and captive,--so she did amass"
1855,CLEOPATRA.,The richness of each land in that one feast.
1856,CLEOPATRA.,
1857,CLEOPATRA.,"More jewelries than one could name or know,"
1858,CLEOPATRA.,Set in a thousand trinkets or in crowns
1859,CLEOPATRA.,"Each one a sovereignty, in glittering row"
1860,CLEOPATRA.,Numbered the suppliant lands and all her thrones.
1861,CLEOPATRA.,
1862,CLEOPATRA.,"And fairest handmaidens in gracious rank,"
1863,CLEOPATRA.,"Their captive arms enchained with links of gold,"
1864,CLEOPATRA.,"Knelt and poured forth the purple wine she drank,"
1865,CLEOPATRA.,Or served her there in postures manifold.
1866,CLEOPATRA.,
1867,CLEOPATRA.,And beaded women of a yellow Ind
1868,CLEOPATRA.,"Stood at the couch, with bended hand to ply"
1869,CLEOPATRA.,Great silver feathered fans wherein the wind
1870,CLEOPATRA.,Gat all the choicest fumes of Araby.
1871,CLEOPATRA.,
1872,CLEOPATRA.,"There in the midst, of shape uncouth and hard,"
1873,CLEOPATRA.,Juggled his arts some Ethiopian churl;
1874,CLEOPATRA.,Changing fierce natures of the spotted pard
1875,CLEOPATRA.,Or serpents of the Nile that creep and curl.
1876,CLEOPATRA.,
1877,CLEOPATRA.,"And many a minstrelsy of voice and string,"
1878,CLEOPATRA.,"Twining sweet sounds like tendrils delicate,"
1879,CLEOPATRA.,Seemed to ensnare the moments--seemed to cling
1880,CLEOPATRA.,Upon their pleasure all interminate.
1881,CLEOPATRA.,
1882,CLEOPATRA.,But now at length she made them serve her wine
1883,CLEOPATRA.,"In the most precious goblet,--wine that shed"
1884,CLEOPATRA.,"Great fragrance, in a goblet fair with shine"
1885,CLEOPATRA.,Of jewels: so they poured the wine out red:
1886,CLEOPATRA.,
1887,CLEOPATRA.,"And lo, to mark that more than any feast"
1888,CLEOPATRA.,"And honour Antony,--or for mere pride"
1889,CLEOPATRA.,"To do so proud a vanity, at least"
1890,CLEOPATRA.,"The proudest, vainest, woman ever tried--"
1891,CLEOPATRA.,
1892,CLEOPATRA.,"She took the unmatched pearl, and, taking, laughed;"
1893,CLEOPATRA.,And when they served her now that wine of worth
1894,CLEOPATRA.,She cast it gleaming in; then with the draught
1895,CLEOPATRA.,Mingling she drank it in their midst with mirth.
1896,CLEOPATRA.,
1897,CLEOPATRA.,"And all that while upon the ocean high,"
1898,CLEOPATRA.,"The golden galley, heavy in its light,"
1899,CLEOPATRA.,Ruled the hoarse sea-sounds with its revelry--
1900,CLEOPATRA.,Changing afar the purples of the night!

1913,CLEOPATRA.,"Even that love, to smite nor be afraid,"
1914,CLEOPATRA.,"Since love shared loss,--yea, when the thing was sealed,"
1915,CLEOPATRA.,And all the trust of Antony betrayed;
1916,CLEOPATRA.,
1917,CLEOPATRA.,"And when, before his eyes and in full sight"
1918,CLEOPATRA.,"Of the still striving ships, that gleaming line"
1919,CLEOPATRA.,Of galleys decked for no rude field of fight
1920,CLEOPATRA.,Fled fair and unashamed in the sunshine;
1921,CLEOPATRA.,
1922,CLEOPATRA.,"Then, surely, he fell down as one but blind"
1923,CLEOPATRA.,"Through sudden fallen darkness, even to grope"
1924,CLEOPATRA.,If haply some least broken he might find
1925,CLEOPATRA.,Of all the broken ends of life and hope.
1926,CLEOPATRA.,
1927,CLEOPATRA.,"Well, out of all his fates now was there none"
1928,CLEOPATRA.,"But Death, the utter end; and for no sake,"
1929,CLEOPATRA.,"Save for some last love-look beneath the sun,"
1930,CLEOPATRA.,Had he delayed that end of all to take!
1931,CLEOPATRA.,
1932,CLEOPATRA.,"But now, because love--armed indeed of him"
1933,CLEOPATRA.,With utter rule of all his destinies--
1934,CLEOPATRA.,"Had chosen even to slay him for a whim,"
1935,CLEOPATRA.,"And the mere remnant was none else than his,"
1936,CLEOPATRA.,
1937,CLEOPATRA.,"And since, for sure, the sorest way of death"
1938,CLEOPATRA.,Were but to die not falling at the feet
1939,CLEOPATRA.,Of that one woman who with look or breath
1940,CLEOPATRA.,Could change it if she would and make it sweet;
1941,CLEOPATRA.,
1942,CLEOPATRA.,He chose before all fame he might have caught
1943,CLEOPATRA.,"With death in foremost fighting, now to cling"
1944,CLEOPATRA.,Upon her steps who at this last had wrought
1945,CLEOPATRA.,His death-wound shameful with a lover’s sting.
1946,CLEOPATRA.,
1947,CLEOPATRA.,O how the memories seemed to throb and start
1948,CLEOPATRA.,Welling from out the unstanched past!--seemed nigh
1949,CLEOPATRA.,Already opening there in all his heart
1950,CLEOPATRA.,The canker wound wherewith he was to die!
1951,CLEOPATRA.,
1952,CLEOPATRA.,"And so, though she were quite estranged, and now"
1953,CLEOPATRA.,He held no costlier gift to win her with;
1954,CLEOPATRA.,"Yet, following, he would find her, and, somehow,"
1955,CLEOPATRA.,Lay in her hands that latest gift--his death:
1956,CLEOPATRA.,
1957,CLEOPATRA.,For now all piteously his heart relied
1958,CLEOPATRA.,On a mere hope of love dwindled to this--
1959,CLEOPATRA.,To fall some fair waste moment at her side
1960,CLEOPATRA.,And feel perhaps a tear or even a kiss;
1961,CLEOPATRA.,
1962,CLEOPATRA.,"Since surely, in some waste of day or night,"
1963,CLEOPATRA.,"He thought, the face of love out of the Past,"
1964,CLEOPATRA.,"With look of his, should rise up in her sight"
1965,CLEOPATRA.,And make some kind of pleading at the last.
1966,CLEOPATRA.,
1967,CLEOPATRA.,"Therefore, when all the heavy heated day"
1968,CLEOPATRA.,"Of rowing on the waters was nigh done,"
1969,CLEOPATRA.,And like a track of sweetness past away
1970,CLEOPATRA.,"Waned on the wave the last track of the sun,"
1971,CLEOPATRA.,
1972,CLEOPATRA.,"At length with scarce a sound or warning cry,"
1973,CLEOPATRA.,"Save of the rowers ceasing from the oar,"
1974,CLEOPATRA.,He reached her side and prayed her pass not by;
1975,CLEOPATRA.,"Yea, prayed her bear him yet a little more."
1976,CLEOPATRA.,
1977,CLEOPATRA.,But truly this well-nigh availed to move
1978,CLEOPATRA.,Her--Cleopatra--with remorse for all:
1979,CLEOPATRA.,"She knew not of such pardon, e’en from love;"
1980,CLEOPATRA.,Nor craved to look upon his utter fall.
1981,CLEOPATRA.,
1982,CLEOPATRA.,"And, first, when it was told her how he came"
1983,CLEOPATRA.,"And sought to reach the galley where she was,"
1984,CLEOPATRA.,"She faltered for a while with fear and shame,"
1985,CLEOPATRA.,And bade them scarce give way to let him pass:
1986,CLEOPATRA.,
1987,CLEOPATRA.,Only at length he showed them the plain sight
1988,CLEOPATRA.,How he was broken and so soon to die;
1989,CLEOPATRA.,"Then they fell back all grieved and gave him right,"
1990,CLEOPATRA.,And scarce believed the man was Antony.
1991,CLEOPATRA.,
1992,CLEOPATRA.,And yet he could not speak; but lay forlorn
1993,CLEOPATRA.,"Crouched up about the gilded quivering prow,"
1994,CLEOPATRA.,"Three days, from morn to night and night to morn,"
1995,CLEOPATRA.,As one whom a sore burden boweth low.
1996,CLEOPATRA.,
1997,CLEOPATRA.,"Harshly the sea-sounds taunted him at will,"
1998,CLEOPATRA.,And seemed in mocking choruses combined;
1999,CLEOPATRA.,Each bitter inward thought was uttered shrill
2000,CLEOPATRA.,On shrieking tongues of many a thwart-blown wind.
2001,CLEOPATRA.,
2002,CLEOPATRA.,And where with onward beak the galley clave
2003,CLEOPATRA.,"Full many a silver mouth in the blue mere,"
2004,CLEOPATRA.,The turned up whitened lips of every wave
2005,CLEOPATRA.,Rang out a bitter cadence on his ear.
2006,CLEOPATRA.,
2007,CLEOPATRA.,But first awhile his thoughts were taking leave
2008,CLEOPATRA.,"Sadly of Rome, and all the pageant days;"
2009,CLEOPATRA.,For now at length he saw and would believe
2010,CLEOPATRA.,The end of triumphs and the end of praise.
2011,CLEOPATRA.,
2012,CLEOPATRA.,"And now he did survey, apart from wrath,"
2013,CLEOPATRA.,The various fates of men both great and small;
2014,CLEOPATRA.,How little reign or glory any hath;
2015,CLEOPATRA.,And how one end comes quickly upon all;
2016,CLEOPATRA.,
2017,CLEOPATRA.,"And thought if love had been--had been quite love,"
2018,CLEOPATRA.,"One little thing in each man’s life for bliss,"
2019,CLEOPATRA.,Then had the grief been paid with sweet enough
2020,CLEOPATRA.,And a lost crown forgotten for a kiss;
2021,CLEOPATRA.,
2022,CLEOPATRA.,"While now, as though men played with fall and rise"
2023,CLEOPATRA.,"Of mere base monies of the common mart,"
2024,CLEOPATRA.,"To-day they strove for love as for a prize,"
2025,CLEOPATRA.,To-morrow compassed fame with every art;
2026,CLEOPATRA.,
2027,CLEOPATRA.,And one who should but half trust any face
2028,CLEOPATRA.,"Of seeming fame, or follow love too well,"
2029,CLEOPATRA.,To set his heart a moment in love’s place--
2030,CLEOPATRA.,"That man should fall,--yea, even as he fell."
2031,CLEOPATRA.,
2032,CLEOPATRA.,"And he thought how, since the first fate began,"
2033,CLEOPATRA.,The lot of every one hath been so cast:
2034,CLEOPATRA.,"One woman bears and brings him up a man,"
2035,CLEOPATRA.,Another woman slays him at the last;
2036,CLEOPATRA.,
2037,CLEOPATRA.,While all so hardly leaguered are men’s ways
2038,CLEOPATRA.,"And love so sharp a snare for them contrives,"
2039,CLEOPATRA.,The fleeting span of one fair woman’s days
2040,CLEOPATRA.,Sufficeth many heroes’ loves and lives!
2041,CLEOPATRA.,
2042,CLEOPATRA.,"--But now, when he had thought all this and more,"
2043,CLEOPATRA.,He lay there and yet moved not from his place;
2044,CLEOPATRA.,"The love of her was in him like a sore,"
2045,CLEOPATRA.,And he lived waiting to behold her face.
2046,CLEOPATRA.,
2047,CLEOPATRA.,At length they drew nigh to a land by name
2048,CLEOPATRA.,"Tænarus; and the third day, at its eve,"
2049,CLEOPATRA.,In guise of one who mourneth the Queen came
2050,CLEOPATRA.,"Weeping, and prayed him rise up and forgive."

2068,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Where art thou writhing? Herod’s palace-floor
2069,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Has fallen through: there shalt thou dance no more;
2070,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And Herod is a worm now. In thy place,"
2071,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"--Salome, Viper!--do thy coils yet keep"
2072,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,That woman’s flesh they bore with such a grace?
2073,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Have thine eyes still the love-lure hidden deep,"
2074,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"The ornament of tears, they could not weep?"
2075,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2076,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Thou wast quite perfect in the splendid guile
2077,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of woman’s beauty; thou hadst the whole smile
2078,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"That can dishonour heroes, and recal"
2079,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Fair saints prepared for heaven back to hell:
2080,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And He, whose unlived glory thou mad’st fall"
2081,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"All beautiful and spotless, at thy spell,"
2082,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Was great and fit for thee by whom he fell.
2083,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2084,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"O, is it now sufficing sweet to thee--"
2085,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Through all the long uncounted years that see
2086,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The undistinguished lost ones waste away--
2087,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"To twine thee, biting, on those locks that bleed,"
2088,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,As bled they through thy fingers on that day?
2089,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Or hast thou, all unhallowed, some fierce need"
2090,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Thy soul on his anointed grace to feed?
2091,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2092,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Or hast thou, rather, for that serpent’s task"
2093,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Thou didst accomplish in thy woman-mask,"
2094,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Some perfect inconceivable reward
2095,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of serpent’s slimy pleasure?--all the thing
2096,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Thou didst beseech thy master, who is Lord"
2097,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of those accursèd hosts that creep and sting,"
2098,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,To give thee for the spoil thou shouldest bring?
2099,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2100,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,He was a goodly spoil for thee to win!
2101,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,--Men’s souls and lives were wholly dark with sin;
2102,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And so God’s world was changed with wars and gold,"
2103,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"No part of it was holy; save, maybe,"
2104,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The desert and the ocean as of old:--
2105,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"But such a spotless way of life had he,"
2106,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,His soul was as the desert or the sea.
2107,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2108,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,I think he had not heard of the far towns;
2109,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Nor of the deeds of men, nor of kings’ crowns;"
2110,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Before the thought of God took hold of him,"
2111,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,As he was sitting dreaming in the calm
2112,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of one first noon, upon the desert’s rim,"
2113,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Beneath the tall fair shadows of the palm,"
2114,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,All overcome with some strange inward balm.
2115,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2116,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"But then, so wonderful and lovely seemed"
2117,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"That thought, he straight became as though he dreamed"
2118,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"A vast thing false and fair, which day and night"
2119,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Absorbed him in some rapture--very high
2120,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Above the common swayings of delight
2121,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And general yearnings, that quite occupy"
2122,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Men’s passions, and suffice them till they die:"
2123,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2124,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Yea, soon as it had entered him--that thought"
2125,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of God--he felt that he was being wrought
2126,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,All holy: more and more it filled his heart;
2127,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And seemed, indeed, a spirit of pure flame"
2128,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Set burning in his soul’s most inward part.
2129,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And from the Lord’s great wilderness there came
2130,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,A mighty voice calling on him by name.
2131,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2132,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"He numbered not the changes of the year,"
2133,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"The days, the nights, and he forgot all fear"
2134,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of death: each day he thought there should have been
2135,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,A shining ladder set for him to climb
2136,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Athwart some opening in the heavens, e’en"
2137,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"To God’s eternity, and see, sublime--"
2138,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,His face whose shadow passing fills all time.
2139,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2140,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,But he walked through the ancient wilderness.
2141,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"O, there the prints of feet were numberless"
2142,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And holy all about him! And quite plain
2143,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,He saw each spot an angel silvershod
2144,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Had lit upon; where Jacob too had lain
2145,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"The place seemed fresh,--and, bright and lately trod,"
2146,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,A long track showed where Enoch walked with God.
2147,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2148,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And often, while the sacred darkness trailed"
2149,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Along the mountains smitten and unveiled
2150,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"By rending lightnings,--over all the noise"
2151,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of thunders and the earth that quaked and bowed
2152,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,From its foundations--he could hear the voice
2153,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of great Elias prophesying loud
2154,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,To Him whose face was covered by a cloud.
2155,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2156,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Already he was shown so perfectly
2157,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The awful mystic grace and sanctity
2158,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of all the earth, there was no part his feet"
2159,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,With sandal covering might dare to tread;
2160,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Because that in it he was sure to meet
2161,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"The fair sword-bearing angels, or some dread"
2162,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Eternal prophet numbered with the dead.
2163,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2164,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,So he believed that he should purify
2165,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"His body, till the sin of it should die,"
2166,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And the unfailing spirit and great word
2167,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of One--who is too bright to be beheld,"
2168,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And in his speech too fearful to be heard
2169,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,By mortal man--should come down and be held
2170,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,In him as in those holy ones of eld.
2171,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2172,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And to believe in this was rapture more
2173,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Than any that the thought of living bore
2174,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,To tempt him: so the pleasant days of youth
2175,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Were but the days of striving and of prayer;
2176,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And all the beauty of those days, forsooth,"
2177,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"He counted as an evil or a snare,"
2178,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And would have left it in the desert there.
2179,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2180,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Ah, spite of all the scourges that had bit"
2181,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"So fiercely his fair body, branding it"
2182,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,With many a painful over-written vow
2183,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of perfect sanctity--what man shall say
2184,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"How often, weak with groanings, he would bow"
2185,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Before the angels of the place, and pray"
2186,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,That all his body might consume away?
2187,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2188,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,For through whole bitter days it seemed in vain
2189,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,That all the mighty desert had no stain
2190,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of sin around him; that the burning breaths
2191,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Went forth from the eternal One, and rolled"
2192,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"For ever through it, filling it with deaths,"
2193,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And plagues, and fires; that he did behold"
2194,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The earthquakes and the wonders manifold:
2195,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2196,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,It seemed in vain that all the place was bright
2197,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Ineffably with that unfading light
2198,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,No man who worketh evil can abide;
2199,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,That he could see too with his open eyes
2200,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Fair troops of deathless ones, and those that died"
2201,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"In martyrdoms, or went up to the skies"
2202,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,In fiery cars--walk there with no disguise;--
2203,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2204,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,It seemed in vain that he was there alone
2205,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,With no man’s sin to tempt him but his own;--
2206,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Since in his body he did bear about
2207,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,A seeming endless sin he could not quell
2208,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"With the most sharp coercement, nor cast out"
2209,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Through any might of prayer. O, who can tell--"
2210,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Save God--how often in despair he fell?
2211,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The very stones seemed purer far than he;
2212,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And every naked rock and every tree
2213,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Looked great and calm, composed in one long thought"
2214,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of holiness; each bird and creeping thing
2215,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Rejoiced in bearing some bright sign that taught
2216,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The legend of an ancient minist’ring
2217,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,To some fair saint of old there sojourning.
2218,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2219,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Yea, all the dumb things and the creatures there"
2220,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Were grand, and some way sanctified; most fair"
2221,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"The very lions stood, and had no shame"
2222,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Before the angels; and what time were poured
2223,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"The floods of the Lord’s anger forth, they came"
2224,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Quite nigh the lightnings of the Mount and roared
2225,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Among the roaring thunders of the Lord:
2226,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2227,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Yet He--while in him day by day, divine,"
2228,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"The clear inspirèd thought went on to shine,"
2229,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And heaven was opening every radiant door
2230,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Upon his spirit--He, in that fair dress"
2231,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of weak humanity his senses bore,"
2232,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Did feel scarce worthy to be there, and less"
2233,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Than any dweller in the wilderness.
2234,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2235,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Wherefore his limbs were galled with many a stone;
2236,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And often he had wrestled all alone
2237,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"With their fair beauty, conquering the pride"
2238,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And various pleasure of them with some quick
2239,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And hard inflicted pain that might abide,--"
2240,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Assailing all the sense with constant prick
2241,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Until the lust or pride fell faint and sick.
2242,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2243,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Natheless there grew and stayed upon his face
2244,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The wonderful unconquerable grace
2245,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of a young man made beautiful with love;
2246,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Because the thought of God was wholly spread
2247,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Like love upon it; and still fair above
2248,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,All crownèd heads of kings remained his head
2249,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Whereon the halo of the Lord was shed.
2250,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2251,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Ah, how long was it, since the first red rush"
2252,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of that surpassing thought made his cheek blush
2253,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"With pleasure, as he sat--a tender child--"
2254,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And wondered at the desert, and the long"
2255,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Rough prickly paths that led out to the wild
2256,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Where all the men of God, holy and strong,"
2257,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Had dwelt and purified themselves--how long?--
2258,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2259,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Before he rose up from his knees one day,"
2260,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And felt that he was purified as they;
2261,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"That he had trodden out the sin at last,"
2262,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And that the light was filling him within?
2263,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,How many of the months and years had past
2264,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Uncounted?--But the place he was born in
2265,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,No longer knew him: no man was his kin.
2266,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2267,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"O then it was a most sweet, holy will"
2268,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"That came upon him, making his soul thrill"
2269,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"With joy indeed, and with a perfect trust,--"
2270,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,For he soon thought of men and of the king
2271,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"All tempted in the world, with gold and lust,"
2272,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And women there, and every fatal thing,"
2273,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And none to save their souls from perishing--
2274,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2275,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And so he vowed that he would go forth straight
2276,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"From God there in the desert, with the great"
2277,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Unearthliness upon him, and adjure"
2278,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The nations of the whole world with his voice;
2279,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Until they should resist each pleasant lure
2280,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of gold and woman, and make such a choice"
2281,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"As his, that they might evermore rejoice."
2282,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2283,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Thus beautiful and good was He, at length,"
2284,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Who came before King Herod in his strength,"
2285,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And shouted to him with a great command
2286,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"To purify himself, and put away"
2287,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,That unclean woman set at his right hand;
2288,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And after all to bow himself and pray,"
2289,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And be in terror of the Judgment Day!
2290,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2291,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,He never had seen houses like to that
2292,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Fair-columned, cedar-builded one where sat"
2293,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"King Herod. Flawless cedar was each beam,"
2294,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Wrought o’er with flaming brass: along the wall
2295,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Great brazen images of beasts did gleam,"
2296,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,With wondrous flower-works and palm trees tall;
2297,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And folded purples hung about it all.
2298,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2299,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"He never had beheld so many thrones,"
2300,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,As those of ivory and precious stones
2301,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Whereon the noble company was raised
2302,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,About the king:--he never had seen gems
2303,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"So costly, nor so wonderful as blazed"
2304,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Upon their many crowns and diadems,"
2305,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And trailed upon their garments’ trodden hems:
2306,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2307,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,But he had seen in mighty Lebanon
2308,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The cedars no man’s axe hath lit upon;
2309,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And he had often worshipped, falling down"
2310,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"In dazzling temples opened straight to him,"
2311,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Where One who had great lightnings for His crown
2312,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Was suddenly made present, vast and dim"
2313,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Through crowded pinions of the Cherubim!
2314,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2315,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Wherefore he had no fear to stand and shout
2316,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"To all men in the place, and there to flout"
2317,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Those fair and fearful women who were seen
2318,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Quite triumphing in that work of their smile
2319,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"To shame a goodly king. And he cast, e’en"
2320,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,A sudden awe that undid for a while
2321,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The made-up shameless visages of guile.
2322,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2323,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And when Herodias--that many times
2324,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Polluted one, assured now in all crimes"
2325,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Past fear or turning--when she, her fierce tongue"
2326,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Thrice forked with indignation, hotly spoke"
2327,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Quick wild beseeching words, wherewith she clung"
2328,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"To Herod, praying him by some death-stroke"
2329,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,To do her vengeance there before all folk--
2330,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2331,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Ah, spite of every urging that her hate"
2332,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Did put into her lips,--so fair and great"
2333,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Seemed that accuser standing weaponless,"
2334,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Yet wholly terrible with his bright speech
2335,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"As ’twere some sword of flaming holiness,"
2336,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,That no man dared to join her and beseech
2337,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,His death; but dread came somehow upon each.
2338,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2339,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,For he was surely terrible to see
2340,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"So plainly sinless, so divinely free"
2341,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"To judge them; being in a perfect youth,"
2342,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Yet walking like an angel in a man
2343,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Reproving all men with inspired truth.
2344,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And Herod himself spoke not, but began"
2345,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,To tremble: through his soul the warning ran.
2346,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2347,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,--Then _that Salome_ did put off the shame
2348,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of her mere virgin girlhood, and became"
2349,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,A woman! Then she did at once essay
2350,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Her beauty’s magic, and unfold the wings"
2351,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of her enchanted feet,--to have men say"
2352,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,She slew _him_--born indeed for wondrous things.
2353,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Her dance was fit to ruin saints or kings.
2354,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2355,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"O, her new beauty was above all praise!"
2356,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"She came with dancing in shy devious ways,"
2357,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And while she danced she sang.
2358,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"The virgin bandlet of her forehead brake,"
2359,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Her hair came round her like a shining snake;
2360,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,To loving her men’s hearts within them sprang
2361,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The while she danced and sang.
2362,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2363,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Her long black hair danced round her like a snake
2364,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Allured to each charmed movement she did make;
2365,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Her voice came strangely sweet;
2366,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"She sang, “O, Herod, wilt thou look on me--"
2367,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Have I no beauty thy heart cares to see?”
2368,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And what her voice did sing her dancing feet
2369,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Seemed ever to repeat.
2370,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2371,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"She sang, “O, Herod, wilt thou look on me?"
2372,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"What sweet I have, I have it all for thee;”"
2373,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And through the dance and song
2374,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,She freed and floated on the air her arms
2375,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Above dim veils that hid her bosom’s charms:
2376,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The passion of her singing was so strong
2377,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,It drew all hearts along.
2378,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2379,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Her sweet arms were unfolded on the air,"
2380,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,They seemed like floating flowers the most fair--
2381,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,White lilies the most choice;
2382,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And in the gradual bending of her hand
2383,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,There lurked a grace that no man could withstand;
2384,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Yea, none knew whether hands, or feet, or voice,"
2385,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Most made his heart rejoice.
2386,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2387,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The veils fell round her like thin coiling mists
2388,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Shot through by topaz suns, and amethysts,"
2389,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And rubies she had on;
2390,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"And out of them her jewelled body came,"
2391,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And seemed to all quite like a slender flame
2392,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"That curled and glided, and that burnt and shone"
2393,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Most fair to look upon.
2394,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2395,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Then she began, on that well-polished floor,"
2396,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Whose stones seemed taking radiance more and more
2397,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"From steps too bright to see,"
2398,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,A certain measure that was like some spell
2399,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of winding magic, wherein heaven and hell"

2401,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,In some mid ecstasy:
2402,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2403,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,For it was so inexplicably wrought
2404,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Of soft alternate motions, that she taught"

2417,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Of its reposeful charm.
2418,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2419,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Her head oft drooped as in some languid death

2430,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The place was full of devils everywhere:
2431,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,They came in from the desert and the air;
2432,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"They came from all the palaces of sin,"
2433,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,And each heart they were in:
2434,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2435,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"They lurked beneath the purples, and did crawl"
2436,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Or crouch in unseen corners of the hall,"
2437,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,Among the brass and gold;
2438,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,They climbed the brazen pillars till they lined
2439,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The chamber fair; and one went up behind
2440,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The throne of Herod--fearful to behold--
2441,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,The Serpent king of old.
2442,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,
2443,THE DAUGHTER OF HERODIAS.,"Yea, too, before those blinded men there went"

2746,HELEN.,The sad thoughts all the summer noons and eves.
2747,HELEN.,
2748,HELEN.,Strange: as her eyes sought where the sea was held
2749,HELEN.,"Gathered into dim distances of blue,"
2750,HELEN.,"Down in her heart a dim Past she beheld,"
2751,HELEN.,Wherein were memories like an ocean too.
2752,HELEN.,
2753,HELEN.,"And strange, there, long up-pent, the memories stirred"
2754,HELEN.,Like waves long rolling: in her heart at length
2755,HELEN.,All the fair time from which her years had erred
2756,HELEN.,Came up against her now with all its strength.
2757,HELEN.,
2758,HELEN.,Back from the earliest love-time there was sent
2759,HELEN.,A tide of all the long untasted sweet
2760,HELEN.,"Of days forgotten, summers that were spent,"
2761,HELEN.,And eves when love and lover used to meet;
2762,HELEN.,
2763,HELEN.,And heavy wafts of perfume that was known
2764,HELEN.,E’en from those dark familiar laurel trees
2765,HELEN.,That hid where love and lover were alone
2766,HELEN.,Rolled back upon the heart with sore disease:
2767,HELEN.,
2768,HELEN.,And from the early home there came no less
2769,HELEN.,Than the reproach of each remembered gaze
2770,HELEN.,"Of friends, and want of all the happiness"
2771,HELEN.,They gave her in their simple Spartan ways.
2772,HELEN.,
2773,HELEN.,"And now her heart strove, longing, to divine"
2774,HELEN.,The several thoughts of her they had devised
2775,HELEN.,In separate years that passed by with no sign;
2776,HELEN.,"Yea, to have known their pain she would have prized:"
2777,HELEN.,
2778,HELEN.,For now when toward them her heart was wrought
2779,HELEN.,"Quite weak, and from no tenderness forbore,"
2780,HELEN.,"They seemed all strong against her, with hard thought"
2781,HELEN.,And faces turning from her evermore.
2782,HELEN.,
2783,HELEN.,And with the vision of them so deceived
2784,HELEN.,Came piteous memories of the waning face
2785,HELEN.,Of the Old man who sat all shamed and grieved
2786,HELEN.,Lonely beside the hearth’s familiar place.
2787,HELEN.,
2788,HELEN.,Before her soon in very semblance gleamed
2789,HELEN.,"The Spartan homestead there unaltered, plain,"
2790,HELEN.,"With all the household things; yea, till she dreamed"
2791,HELEN.,"All were yet to begin that way again,"
2792,HELEN.,
2793,HELEN.,And Menelaus the next golden morn
2794,HELEN.,"Were still to come for her with wedlock blest,"
2795,HELEN.,As though not all deserted and forlorn
2796,HELEN.,He strayed--the lone man without love or rest.
2797,HELEN.,
2798,HELEN.,"But most she yearned between her fear and love,"
2799,HELEN.,To see him now--divining what was due
2800,HELEN.,To wrath and sorrowing to change and move
2801,HELEN.,His features from the fashion that she knew:
2802,HELEN.,
2803,HELEN.,For now the first time after all those years
2804,HELEN.,The face seemed anyhow her way to seek;
2805,HELEN.,--But turned upon her now with all its tears
2806,HELEN.,And vengeance of reproach at length to wreak;
2807,HELEN.,
2808,HELEN.,"--And seemed to hold her through her love come back,"
2809,HELEN.,"Unforeseen, and how come, she could not tell;"
2810,HELEN.,"So that the wrath of it, the grief could rack"
2811,HELEN.,"Her heart,--yet her heart craved therewith to dwell."
2812,HELEN.,
2813,HELEN.,He was her husband--it should ever seem;
2814,HELEN.,"And that home, surely it was still her home;"
2815,HELEN.,And years since some long voyage or a dream;
2816,HELEN.,And now no more the heart was fain to roam:
2817,HELEN.,
2818,HELEN.,"Nay, but was true to where it felt begin"
2819,HELEN.,Love and the rosy ecstasies so brief;
2820,HELEN.,"And that was surely love and the rest sin,"
2821,HELEN.,That all delight and all the other grief.
2822,HELEN.,
2823,HELEN.,And now though none should render her heart’s right
2824,HELEN.,"In any fair place where she used to sit,"
2825,HELEN.,She would have prayed for a mere alien’s sight
2826,HELEN.,Of all it was so little pain to quit:
2827,HELEN.,
2828,HELEN.,"Just to draw near, some silent hour, alone,"
2829,HELEN.,"Unheralded, unwelcomed, and behold"
2830,HELEN.,"Her husband and remember him her own,"
2831,HELEN.,And be quite near him only as of old:
2832,HELEN.,
2833,HELEN.,"And perchance, for some grief that was exprest"
2834,HELEN.,"Plainly upon his face, she might have dared"
2835,HELEN.,"To enter in, and after all been blest"
2836,HELEN.,Some remnant of his pity to have shared.
2837,HELEN.,
2838,HELEN.,"--Alas, too surely, for long years, all thought"
2839,HELEN.,And love of her had perished from his heart;
2840,HELEN.,Until on all her memory were wrought
2841,HELEN.,"Dishonour, and with him she had no part;"
2842,HELEN.,
2843,HELEN.,"--And this the while, so held of alien joys,"
2844,HELEN.,"She spared no thought for him and for his pain,"
2845,HELEN.,Nor fancied the least echo of his voice
2846,HELEN.,Sent forth a thousand times to her in vain;
2847,HELEN.,
2848,HELEN.,"When, might-be many a time, his earnest grief"
2849,HELEN.,"Sent it so truly seeking her quite near,"
2850,HELEN.,Vainly it fell on some dumb flower or leaf
2851,HELEN.,"Beside her, never cherished in her ear."
2852,HELEN.,
2853,HELEN.,And she thought how one day--she heeding nought--
2854,HELEN.,The last voice on the fruitless air was borne
2855,HELEN.,"And died almost a taunt, and the last thought"
2856,HELEN.,Of her was changed to hate or utter scorn.
2857,HELEN.,
2858,HELEN.,"And she thought how since that time, day by day,"
2859,HELEN.,"The man had learnt to live without her need,"
2860,HELEN.,"And been quite happy perhaps many a way,"
2861,HELEN.,All without loving her or taking heed.
2862,HELEN.,
2863,HELEN.,And that which was the great woe had scarce grown
2864,HELEN.,In any gradual way; but with a burst
2865,HELEN.,"Her life was torn apart from peace, and thrown"
2866,HELEN.,Far from the love that seemed its own at first
2867,HELEN.,
2868,HELEN.,All for a mere girl’s fancy too--a whim
2869,HELEN.,"For foreign faces and some ruddier south,"
2870,HELEN.,And no real choice to die away from him
2871,HELEN.,Who won the truest troth in love and youth.
2872,HELEN.,
2873,HELEN.,"Now it was bitter to be quite outcast,"
2874,HELEN.,And bitter--when this thought of dying crost
2875,HELEN.,Her heart--to reach him no more at the last
2876,HELEN.,"Than in mere rumour, as of one long lost."
2877,HELEN.,
2878,HELEN.,She looked upon the great sea rolled between
2879,HELEN.,"Herself and Lacedæmon: but the Past,"
2880,HELEN.,The sins and all the falseness that had been
2881,HELEN.,Seemed like an ocean deeper and more vast.

2888,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.
2889,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2890,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2891,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"--So, Woman! I possess you. Yes, at length."
2892,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Once wholly and for ever you are mine!
2893,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2894,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"That cursèd burden on my memory,"
2895,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Your whole past life’s betrayal--let it go:
2896,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Ay, let it perish, and, for me at least,"
2897,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Let life begin this moment, though we die"
2898,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,But three hours hence!
2899,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2900,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Is this your little voice
2901,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"My Love, enthralling, winning my whole faith"
2902,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"With mere increasing sweetness in its tones,"
2903,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Dissolving, exorcising, as it used,"
2904,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Ah too infallibly, the phantom thing,"
2905,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The doubt, the dread within me? ah, my Sweet,"
2906,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Is this once more your voice assuring me--
2907,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,With some rare music rather than one word
2908,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of those fair whispered oaths of constancy;
2909,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Yea, till, as ever, I am come to smile"
2910,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And glory in you, and believe you pure--"
2911,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"All mine, for ever, past a change in thought?"
2912,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2913,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,But no! _It is the little voice of the Steel
2914,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Here safe against my breast and fairly hid:
2915,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The Steel is singing to me, very low,"
2916,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,A tender song entrancing me_;--O joy!
2917,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,The Steel says you will ne’er escape me more;
2918,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,You will be true to me; you will be mine;
2919,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"No man shall touch you after me; no face,"
2920,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"However strangely fair, shall have the art"
2921,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"To draw one look from you, to charm and rouse"
2922,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,That wondrous little snake of treachery
2923,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,That was for ever lurking for me--sure
2924,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,To spring upon me out of the least look
2925,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Or promise, safe to be curled up beneath"
2926,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,The simplest seeming offering in your hand.
2927,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2928,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Yes, ’tis a thing at length as good as this"
2929,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The steel is singing to me: did you hear,"
2930,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,You should but love it--since it pleads so well
2931,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,It makes me put whole faith in you once more.
2932,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"For now three days and nights indeed--while I,"
2933,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Contending for you with the love I gave
2934,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Against the curse I owed you, raged and thought"
2935,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,It was my madness--O this little voice
2936,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Was striving with me, singing all the time,"
2937,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Upon a low sweet soothing tune, strange words"
2938,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of promise that seemed like the distant taunts
2939,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Of all my past beliefs, and that I sought"
2940,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"To cover with my curses; till, last night,"
2941,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"My soul grew faint with hearing them--how sweet,"
2942,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"How full of good they were. Then I fell still,"
2943,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Yea, stunned, and with my head upon the ground;"
2944,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And through the shut bleared darkness of my eyes,"
2945,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I seemed to see the room about me lit
2946,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And fearful, and the Sword from off the wall"
2947,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Unscabbarded before me in the midst,"
2948,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Most terrible and living, and in light--"
2949,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Just like a great archangel with the glare
2950,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of burning expiations full on him.
2951,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2952,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,O then my soul did call upon the Steel;
2953,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And the Steel heard and swore to me. My soul
2954,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Tore forth the hidden-rooted love of thee,"
2955,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Thy treasured words--each one a cruel worm
2956,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"That gnaws me through for ever, thy fair face"
2957,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"From the first inmost shrine, thy early kiss,"
2958,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Thy separate falsenesses, all my despair,"
2959,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"My utter helplessness--and flung them down,"
2960,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,The very writhing entrails of my life
2961,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Become one inward horror to be borne
2962,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"No longer. And there came about me, loud,"
2963,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The mocking of a thousand impious tongues,"
2964,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,That seemed to clash and rattle hideously
2965,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,From ancient hollow sepulchres of men
2966,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Long buried and forgotten; for my love
2967,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Their gibe was, for my faith, for my despair,"
2968,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"For my long blindness: and at last I knew,"
2969,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And, understanding, called with a great voice"
2970,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Upon the Steel: and the Steel heard me there,"
2971,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And swore to me--for you and me and God!
2972,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2973,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"_Sing on, O little voice: She cannot hear;_"
2974,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,_There is a pact between us._
2975,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2976,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Now I stand
2977,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And feel her eyes’ soft element within,"
2978,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Upon, around me, melting away life"
2979,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Into these few full throbbing moments.--Lo!
2980,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Her tears again--her disavowal clean
2981,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of any thought of falseness. Lo! her words--
2982,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I might have lived beside her all these days
2983,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"In perfect joy; words, blandishments and tears"
2984,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Already staggering me with their old might
2985,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of coiling fascinations; and one tear
2986,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"A drop that, falling straight into my heart,"
2987,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Fills it too full for speaking a long time
2988,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,The ready thing of pardon and of love.
2989,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2990,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"See! am I Lord here?--This fair sight of Her,"
2991,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Working the whole impassioned prodigy
2992,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"As ’twere of all her beauty, just to win"
2993,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"_Me_ this time and, at any cost, be queen"
2994,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Of this one present, as of many pasts--"
2995,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Hath ever it been fairer, more complete?"
2996,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
2997,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Who else hath had her more and called her his
2998,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Than here I have her calling herself mine?
2999,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I would indeed he might draw near just now,"
3000,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Yea, void of feigning, in some wonted way,"
3001,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And feel a cold look from her plant him there
3002,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Outside the circle where this molten love
3003,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Of her whole smile is showered upon me,"
3004,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And know her no more his now than mine then.
3005,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3006,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,But what do I here with a thought like this?
3007,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Those men I deemed my rivals--what are they
3008,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,To me now? Why I could put them to shame
3009,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And taunt them now myself for insolent
3010,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Pretenders who have never known what ’tis
3011,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"To conquer love.--Ay, what compared with me"
3012,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Seem all the famous lovers of great queens
3013,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Or splendid cruel mistresses, whose woes--"
3014,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Deceived, betrayed, reviled--have made them shine"
3015,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,With some bright share of every age’s tears?
3016,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,What but mere fools? weak sufferers of wrong
3017,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,From creatures whom they held in their own hands?
3018,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Or passionless, or lacking any strength"
3019,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,To seize their fair worlds passing them so nigh
3020,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Rather than linger in some sickly trail
3021,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of sweetness left behind and die of shame?
3022,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,O all ye Messalinas of old time--
3023,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Ye Helens, Cleopatras, ye Dalilahs,"
3024,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Ye Maries, ye Lucrezias, Catharines--"
3025,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Fair crowned or uncrowned--courtezans alike
3026,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Who played with men a calculated game--
3027,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Your moves their heart-wounds, deaths and ruins--sure"
3028,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Of your inconstancy and their soft loves,"
3029,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Had I been lover in the stead of them,"
3030,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Methinks the histories of you had been changed,"
3031,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And some of your worst falsenesses redeemed
3032,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,By flawless faithfulness to one last love.
3033,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3034,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"But now I am content, I have love here;"
3035,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And I thank God for love--yea, is it sweet?"
3036,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Yea, is it best of all his gifts to man?"
3037,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,--I see her splendid smile there--feel her arms
3038,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Already coming round me!--Who but I
3039,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Can answer? Who but I have had it whole
3040,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Like this? _(The Steel is singing to me now,"
3041,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Still hidden in my breast--a low sweet song.)_
3042,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3043,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Ah, this time there is no doubt! ’tis all true:"
3044,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Her arms may fold me--fondle me, and I"
3045,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,May wholly yield myself to their caress
3046,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Quite sure it leaves no atom in reserve
3047,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"For any other after me. And lo,"
3048,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,She is right worthy of a greater one
3049,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Than all the lovers that have ever loved
3050,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And, trembling, lost their women and themselves:"
3051,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,For splendour--such as stains for me and turns
3052,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,My eyes disgusted from the vaunted white
3053,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of many a bosom impudently bared--
3054,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Is in that bosom closely veiled, whose veils"
3055,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I may undo--yea now, and with these hands;"
3056,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"It is my right. And then, O joy, to know"
3057,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"That this, so much more wonderful than those,"
3058,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Shall ne’er be seen by anyone but me!
3059,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"(Ah, sing on little voice!) But, as I said,"
3060,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"--Yes, she is worthy!--Come to me, my Sweet:"
3061,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,You have the greatest beauty God has made.
3062,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I think that. Let me kiss your forehead once,"
3063,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Twice, thrice, and say it is diviner white,"
3064,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And hallowed with a brighter radiant grace
3065,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Than Cleopatra’s was, and swear therewith"
3066,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I kiss it with a passion greater far
3067,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Than Antony’s was: yea, let me write there"
3068,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,This thing in kisses that none can efface.
3069,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"“Ah, you believe me now, dear love?” she says:"
3070,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Yes: I say yes. _(Sing on! ’Twas you sang: yes;
3071,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,You bade me answer so. I trust you most.)_
3072,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3073,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"“Dear Love, let us go lie upon that bed."
3074,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I should delight to know it just the grave,"
3075,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"So I might keep this faith and happiness,"
3076,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"That yours--this mine--both safe for evermore,"
3077,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"So I might lie down sure that no mischance,"
3078,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"No doubt, no calumny, could come to change"
3079,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Me--yours, you--mine, and peace for evermore.”"
3080,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3081,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"She says this, and she leads me by the hand."
3082,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3083,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Her head is like a lily drooping down.
3084,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3085,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,--My passion! Yea I will not baulk thee now:
3086,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I need not: for I feel that what I am
3087,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Is something more than man, that conquers man."
3088,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"What is it? I know not: a flame, a thought;"
3089,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"But cold, but calm, unalterable, pure,"
3090,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,As far above the fume of the base lust
3091,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"That dulls and levels all men, as, perhaps,"
3092,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Was that strange flame or thought that made Man first
3093,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And Woman then to bring the man to nought,"
3094,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Which fate I, who indeed am not a god,"
3095,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Who am not Hercules, nor Samson, no,"
3096,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Nor Antony--which fate I yet will change.
3097,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Nay, passion, rather I will urge thee on;"
3098,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,For I shall be above thee all the time
3099,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"A cold impartial watcher, hard to foil,"
3100,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Attentive that thou gettest all thine own
3101,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Not tampered with--lest, in some little thing,"
3102,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Thou art betrayed, or with a semblance served,"
3103,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Yea, for a blind fool as thou ever wert."
3104,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3105,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,--O take thy fill of looking on this snow
3106,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,In which thy heart finds such delicious death;
3107,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Do out thine utmost revel on the bloom
3108,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Of this rare flower’s beauty, now at full;"
3109,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Whose summer is just perfected to-night
3110,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And laid before thee, heightened with the tint"
3111,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Of first mysterious sadness, like a touch"
3112,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of far-off autumns. Do not shun that mouth:
3113,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"For there, indeed, a thing most dainty-sweet--"
3114,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,The last kiss that was sown a precious seed
3115,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"By Love at the beginning--waits for thee,"
3116,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The fullest, the most perfect of them all."
3117,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The earth will never fashion forth, and Love"
3118,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Will never with his summer paint again
3119,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,So beautiful a flower.
3120,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3121,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I am clasped
3122,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,With such arms as I would might hold me so
3123,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"For evermore in heaven. All around,"
3124,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,The strange unearthly fragrance of her hair
3125,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Is coming up, and, with an element"
3126,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Divine as some transparent rosy cloud,"
3127,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Enwrapping both of us; ay, and, as though--"
3128,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,A very cloud of magic--it had borne
3129,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Us, lifted far away from thought, and life,"
3130,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And days, and earthliness--we seem to voyage"
3131,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Through most ethereal atmospheres, and seas"
3132,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Upon whose soft sustaining waves we drift,"
3133,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And draw no sound from either distant shore
3134,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Of ending or beginning: and the bliss,"
3135,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Unspeakable and perfect, that we feel"
3136,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Seems making and remaking evermore
3137,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Our souls through this eternity.
3138,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3139,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Alas!
3140,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,One little thread--I strive in vain to break--
3141,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Is holding me: a memory, a thought,"
3142,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The pricking of a half-numbed wound through sleep,"
3143,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The constant teazing of a wingéd thing,"
3144,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,The bitterness wherewith some ceaseless fang
3145,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Of life gnaws through, and breaks our dream of it--"
3146,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Some such pursues and racks me. But ’tis well:
3147,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I know the dream is mine to make my own;
3148,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I know what dragon guards this paradise,"
3149,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And with what paltry lies he fools mankind.
3150,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Ah, how the universe must jeer to see"
3151,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,All men so smoothly cheated of their own!--
3152,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And when I slay this dragon, I have all."
3153,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3154,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I cannot stir now. Many a knotted tress
3155,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Is on me, like a thousand-threaded chain"
3156,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Twined many times about my limbs. I dream
3157,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,No more: I feel her small and gliding hands
3158,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Seek mine; and while the burning rapid words
3159,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Her full heart furnishes hiss in mine ear,"
3160,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,My sight is peering blindly through the dark
3161,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of her vast hair--a cavernous abyss
3162,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of blackness traversed by mad shooting sparks
3163,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Or fearful gleams of blood.--What things she says!
3164,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"“--Let this be as it were my bridal night,"
3165,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,If you doubt all the Past. I am yours now;
3166,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Take this for the beginning, and trust me;"
3167,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I will be yours for ever,--not a look,"
3168,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"A word, a thought shall e’er dishonour you.”--"
3169,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And, if I had not heard this very thing"
3170,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Before, once, twice, innumerable times,"
3171,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I should not plunge as I do now, my head"
3172,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Still deeper in the fathomless dark hair,"
3173,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And see tears falling from me--as it seems--
3174,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,To fall on through a drear eternity.
3175,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3176,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"But, hark, another voice! Whence comes it?--Whence?"
3177,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"From here, beneath the pillow; yes, ’tis harsh"
3178,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And not like hers; but speaks a sweet thing--this:
3179,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,_I swear for Her it shall be so: trust Me!_
3180,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3181,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Ah, yes--my Love, my own, I answer you;"
3182,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I part with all the Past, forgive, deny,"
3183,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Refuse to see it. All my soul is yours;
3184,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I never loved a moment in this world,"
3185,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,But what was love was wholly meant for you.
3186,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Yea, even before I saw you as you are,"
3187,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Or knew your name, the vaguest breaths of love"
3188,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Were but sent forward to me from the days
3189,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"When you should come, preparing me for you."
3190,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I know in truth there never was a time
3191,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Wherein I saw no part of you--nor sign
3192,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"To love you by; for all my sun, my light,"
3193,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"My flowers, my world would be the saddest blank,"
3194,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The day you were not; you have these in you,"
3195,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And are yourself in them; and, on the day"
3196,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"You go, you take them all away with you;"
3197,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And so ’twas you I saw when I saw them
3198,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And said:--“_That Lady mine_ shall have a head
3199,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Like yonder drooping lily on whose white
3200,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,The summer’s breath may never set a stain;
3201,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And She shall have a heaven for her hair
3202,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"As deep, and dark, and splendid, as the one"
3203,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I dream beneath; and She shall have such eyes
3204,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,As ever seem to me those still blue lakes
3205,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I come on in the twilight of the woods
3206,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And find wide open under the thick fringe
3207,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of violets--that fascinate me so
3208,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"With gazing on me; yes, and, for her smile,"
3209,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,She shall but use that magic of the sun
3210,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"That so transfigures all the day with light,"
3211,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And gives my heart already such a thrill
3212,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"As if She smiled at me:”--my Love, ’twas you"
3213,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I saw then, dreamed of, waited for; ’twas you;"
3214,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"My heart attests it, looking on you now.--"
3215,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,So this of mine is such a perfect love
3216,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"You see, it could not change nor turn away;--"
3217,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"It is the only love God made for you,"
3218,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,As you He made for me and from the first
3219,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Revealed to me. Therefore it cannot be
3220,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"That you are false to me,--that I no way"
3221,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Can save and keep you mine--you whom He gave
3222,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"To me for ever, to be brought as mine"
3223,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Before Him at the last. My precious one,"
3224,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,You are all worthy of me--are my crown
3225,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Untarnished, perfect, for you have not sinned;"
3226,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"’Tis I have sinned,--not being strong at once"
3227,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,To save both pure in you. Did not your lips
3228,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Completely make you mine of your own will?
3229,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Did you not swear yourself to me at first,"
3230,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Yea, in God’s name, before him? So that I--"
3231,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Yes, I, have let you, all against your heart,"
3232,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Be brought to do sad things you would have shunned;
3233,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Because I had the way, and used it not,"
3234,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"To keep you from them.--Ah, I curse myself!"
3235,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"--My own, my Love!--those gentle words of yours,"
3236,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Those promises--repeat them; yes, once more:"
3237,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3238,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"You will be mine; you are mine; yes, my Love,"
3239,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I do believe you now; I may, I can--"
3240,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,(For _that_ sings under the pillow; believe Me!--)
3241,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I bless and kiss you for them all.
3242,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3243,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,She sleeps.
3244,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3245,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,_The Steel is singing to me now; its voice_
3246,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"_Creeps through and through;_--go on, she cannot hear--"
3247,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"_The things it sings are death and love; ay, love_"
3248,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"_That death keeps true;_--She sleeps, she cannot hear."
3249,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3250,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,There is no sort of madness in my brain;
3251,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"But rather a great strength, a calm, as though"
3252,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,A more than human spirit dwelt with mine.
3253,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And yet I do perceive that, since last night,"
3254,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,My eyes have been bewildered with the glare
3255,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Of mighty blades and swords that seem to whirl
3256,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And strike around me, and transform the world"
3257,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,With an exceeding splendour cold and bare;
3258,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,A thousand films are as it were cut through;
3259,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And all the beauty, supernatural"
3260,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And real of things seems only to endure.
3261,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,The Steel is an immense magician: yes--
3262,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Love, Beauty, Life--a touch can change them all"
3263,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And make them wholly fit for me and great.
3264,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,See now where _it_ is gleaming through her hair!
3265,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,’Tis like a fair barbaric ornament
3266,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Ablaze with glancing points of diamonds
3267,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Stuck in and out between the writhing black.
3268,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Or, rather, ’tis as fearful and as bright"
3269,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,As some fierce snake of azure lightning curled
3270,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Sinister under the dark mass of night,"
3271,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"That ever, with his sudden forkéd flash"
3272,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Piercing some crevice, doth illumine it."
3273,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3274,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,I could be gazing on this sight for hours.
3275,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3276,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"O, Woman!--you are greatest in the world:"
3277,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,You have all fairest things; all joy is yours
3278,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,To give and take away; you have all love;
3279,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Your beauty is to man’s heart as the sun
3280,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,That doles out day and night to the whole earth;
3281,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,You have strange gifts of passion and sweet words:
3282,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"In truth you are right splendid,--and well fit,"
3283,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"I think, to be the leman of a god;"
3284,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"But all too fair, and yet not good enough,"
3285,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,To be the spouse and helpmate of one man.
3286,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,--For this: there is a serpent in you hid;
3287,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"It dwells in the invisible of thought,"
3288,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Or crouches in some corner of your heart,"
3289,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Or is engendered in the ardent flame
3290,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Of your quick passions,--where, it matters not;"
3291,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,But never doth it cease so to distil
3292,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Its wily poison into all you are
3293,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Or do or feel, it makes you turn and stab"
3294,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Where most you thought to love,--it sets your lips"
3295,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"In league with falsehood to betray your heart,"
3296,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Puts plotting in your heart against your lips.
3297,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3298,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,You cannot will your heart to any man
3299,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"But you must seek, for very wantonness--"
3300,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,As tempts the snake within you--just the straight
3301,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Betrayal of that man--his love, his faith,"
3302,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,As though you had not willed yourself at first:
3303,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And if you did not this somehow, your life"
3304,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Would seem to you a nipped and withered thing,"
3305,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Your beauty good for nought. You are made so.
3306,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"--Therefore, my Love, I will not let you wake."
3307,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Nay--though you are so pure now and have sworn--
3308,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Lest you betray me as you did last time,"
3309,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"And times before that, having sworn as now."
3310,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"But you are mine--my beautiful, my own!"
3311,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,And your lips said it while your heart beat here
3312,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Against mine--thrilling with a thought of me;
3313,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Your looks were almost piteous with a prayer
3314,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"That I--that God would save you. Shall your mouth,"
3315,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"The chaste, the holy one that I have kissed"
3316,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Be desecrate once more? Shall your own arms
3317,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Embrace and hug the very shame of you?
3318,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Shall this, your heart that made you mine, be false"
3319,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,--Go once more seeking out adulteries?
3320,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3321,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,Not so: I strike the holy steel in it.
3322,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,
3323,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,--It was the only way to keep her mine.

3342,A TROTH FOR ETERNITY.,"Hath had small pity,--with a wanton kiss"

3374,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,
3375,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"If you go over desert and mountain,"
3376,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Far into the country of sorrow,"
3377,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"To-day and to-night and to-morrow,"
3378,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And maybe for months and for years;
3379,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"You shall come, with a heart that is bursting"
3380,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"For trouble and toiling and thirsting,"
3381,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,You shall certainly come to the fountain
3382,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"At length,--to the Fountain of Tears."
3383,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,
3384,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Very peaceful the place is, and solely"
3385,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"For piteous lamenting and sighing,"
3386,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And those who come living or dying
3387,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,Alike from their hopes and their fears;
3388,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Full of cypress-like shadows the place is,"
3389,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And statues that cover their faces:
3390,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,But out of the gloom springs the holy
3391,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And beautiful Fountain of Tears.
3392,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,
3393,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And it flows and it flows with a motion
3394,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"So gentle and lovely and listless,"
3395,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And murmurs a tune so resistless
3396,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,To him who hath suffered and hears--
3397,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"You shall surely--without a word spoken,"
3398,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Kneel down there and know your heart broken,"
3399,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And yield to the long curb’d emotion
3400,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,That day by the Fountain of Tears.
3401,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,
3402,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"For it grows and it grows, as though leaping"

3404,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And ever its tunes go on sinking
3405,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,More poignantly into the ears:
3406,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Yea, so blesséd and good seems that fountain,"
3407,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Reached after dry desert and mountain,"
3408,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,You shall fall down at length in your weeping
3409,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And bathe your sad face in the tears.
3410,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,
3411,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Then, alas! while you lie there a season,"
3412,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"And sob between living and dying,"
3413,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And give up the land you were trying
3414,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,To find mid your hopes and your fears;
3415,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,--O the world shall come up and pass o’er you;
3416,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Strong men shall not stay to care for you,"
3417,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,Nor wonder indeed for what reason
3418,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,Your way should seem harder than theirs.
3419,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,
3420,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"But perhaps, while you lie, never lifting"

3422,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,Nor caring to raise your wet tresses.
3423,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"And look how the cold world appears,--"
3424,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,O perhaps the mere silences round you--
3425,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"All things in that place grief hath found you,"
3426,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Yea, e’en to the clouds o’er you drifting,"
3427,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,May soothe you somewhat through your tears.
3428,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,
3429,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"You may feel, when a falling leaf brushes"
3430,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Your face, as though some one had kissed you;"
3431,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,Or think at least some one who missed you
3432,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Hath sent you a thought,--if that cheers;"
3433,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Or a bird’s little song, faint and broken,"
3434,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,May pass for a tender word spoken:
3435,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"--Enough, while around you there rushes"
3436,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,That life-drowning torrent of tears.
3437,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,
3438,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"And the tears shall flow faster and faster,"
3439,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,"Brim over, and baffle resistance,"
3440,THE FOUNTAIN OF TEARS.,And roll down bleared roads to each distance

3911,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And he looked on me the while
3912,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,With a most strange smile.
3913,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
3914,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,But my heart seemed well to know
3915,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,That his face the semblance had
3916,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Of my own face long ago
3917,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Ere the years had made it sad,"
3918,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,When my youthful looks were clad
3919,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,In a smile half glad;
3920,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,To my heart he seemed in truth
3921,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,All my vanished youth.
3922,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
3923,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Then he named me by a name
3924,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Long since unfamiliar grown,"
3925,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,But remembered for the same
3926,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,That my childhood’s ears had known;
3927,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And his voice was like my own
3928,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,In a sadder tone
3929,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Coming from the happy years
3930,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Choked, alas, with tears."
3931,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
3932,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And, as though he nothing knew"
3933,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Of that day’s fair triumphing,"
3934,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Or the Present were not true,"
3935,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Or not worth remembering,"
3936,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,All the Past he seemed to bring
3937,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,As a piteous thing
3938,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Back upon my heart again,"
3939,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Yea, with a great pain:"
3940,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
3941,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,“Do you still remember the winding street
3942,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,In the grey old village?” He seemed to say;
3943,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,“And the long school days that the sun made sweet
3944,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And the thought of the flowers from far away?
3945,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And the faces of friends whom you used to meet
3946,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"In that village day by day,"
3947,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"--Ay, the face of this one or of that?” he said,"
3948,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And the names he named were names of the dead
3949,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Who all in the churchyard lay.
3950,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
3951,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"“Do you still remember your brother’s face,"
3952,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And his soft light hair, and his eyes’ deep blue,"
3953,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And the child’s pet name that in every place
3954,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Was once so familiar to him and to you?
3955,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And the innocent sports and the butterfly chase
3956,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,That lasted the bright day through?”
3957,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"--O this time, I thought of the churchyard and sighed,"
3958,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"For I thought of the dead lying side by side,"
3959,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And my brother who lay there too.
3960,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
3961,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,“And do you remember the far green hills;
3962,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Or the long straight path by the side of the stream;
3963,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Or the road that led to the farm and the mills,"
3964,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And the fields where you oft used to wander or dream
3965,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Or follow each change of your childish wills
3966,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Like the dance of some gay sunbeam?”--
3967,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Then, alas, from right weeping I could not refrain,"
3968,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"For indeed all those things I remembered again,--"
3969,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,As of yesterday they did seem.
3970,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
3971,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And I thought of a day in a far lost Spring,"
3972,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,When the sun with a kiss set the wild flowers free;
3973,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,When my heart felt the kiss and the shadowy wing
3974,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Of some beautiful spirit of things to be,"
3975,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Who breathed in the song that the wild birds sing
3976,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Some deep tender meaning for me,--"
3977,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Who undid a strange spell in the world as it were,"
3978,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Who set wide sweet whispers abroad in the air,--"
3979,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Made a presence I could not see.
3980,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
3981,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,O that whisper my heart seemed to understand!
3982,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,O that spell it took hold on right willing feet!
3983,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"To that beautiful spirit I gave my hand,"
3984,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And he led me that day up the village street,"
3985,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And out through the fields and the fragrant land,"
3986,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And on through the pathways sweet;
3987,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Yea, still on, with a semblance of some new bliss,"
3988,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Through the world he has led me from that day to this
3989,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,With a tender and fair deceit.
3990,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
3991,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,“O for what have you wandered so far--so long?”
3992,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Said the voice that was e’en as my voice of old:
3993,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,“O for what have you done to the Past such wrong?
3994,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Was there no fair dream on your own threshold?
3995,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,In your childhood’s home was there no fresh song?
3996,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,--Was your heart then all so cold?
3997,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Why, at length, are you weary and lone and sad,"
3998,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,But for casting away all the good that you had
3999,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,With the peace that was yours of old?
4000,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
4001,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"“Have you wholly forgotten the words you said,"
4002,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"When you stood by a certain mound of earth,"
4003,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,When you vowed with your heart that that place you made
4004,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"The last burial place for your love and your mirth,"
4005,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,For the pure past blisses you therein laid
4006,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Were surely your whole life’s worth?--
4007,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"O, the angels who deck the lone graves with their tears"
4008,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Have cared for this, morning and evening, for years,"
4009,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,But of yours there has been long dearth:
4010,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
4011,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"“In the pure pale sheen of a hallowed night,"
4012,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"When the graves are looking their holiest,"
4013,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,You may see it more glistering and more bright
4014,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And holier-looking than all the rest;
4015,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,You may see that the dews and the stars’ strange light
4016,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Are loving that grave the best;
4017,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"But, perhaps, if you went in the clear noon-day,"
4018,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,After so many years you might scarce find the way
4019,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Ere you tired indeed of the quest:
4020,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
4021,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,“For the path that leads to it is almost lost;
4022,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And quite tall grass-flowers of sickly blue
4023,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Have grown up there and gathered for years, and tost"
4024,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Bitter germs all around them to grow up too;
4025,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,For indeed all these years not a man has crost
4026,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,That pathway--not even You!”--
4027,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"But alas! for these words to my heart he sent,"
4028,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"For I knew it was Marguérite’s grave that he meant,"
4029,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And I felt that the words were true.
4030,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
4031,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Then the dim sweet faces of them of yore
4032,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Seemed to start from the mist where the memory lies;
4033,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And each one was as sweet and as dear as before;
4034,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,But a piteous look was in all their eyes--
4035,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Yea, the long smile of sadness; and each one bore"
4036,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,A reproach in some tender wise:
4037,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Till my bosom was troubled and sorely thrilled
4038,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"With the thought of them all, and my ears were filled"
4039,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,With a sound of the mingling of sighs.
4040,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
4041,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And my heart, where the memories of them were cast"
4042,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And as buried and choked in the dust of the years,"
4043,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Became peopled, it seemed, with the shapes of the Past;"
4044,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And the voice of my brother grew fresh in my ears:
4045,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,So my dried up eyes were softened at last
4046,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,To weeping some few sweet tears;
4047,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,But the Man who was sitting at my fireside--
4048,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,He covered his face with his hands and cried
4049,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,As I did in those earlier years.
4050,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
4051,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Then I faltered,--“O Spectre of my lost Youth!"
4052,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"All too well at thy pleading the sad thoughts wake,"
4053,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"With the bitter regret of the Past, and in truth"
4054,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,The whole love of the fair things that all men forsake;
4055,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And for this thy reproach I am filléd with ruth--
4056,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,My heart seemeth nigh to break:
4057,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Ah! right gladly would I now return with thee
4058,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"To those loves and those lovers, if that might be,"
4059,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And be happy for their sweet sake.
4060,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
4061,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"“And, O Spectre that wearest my look--my face,"
4062,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And art ever with them as the thought they keep
4063,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,To remind them of me in the changeless place
4064,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"In the changeless Past where the memories sleep,--"
4065,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Do thou tell them I am not all barren of grace,"
4066,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Nor have buried their love so deep,"
4067,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"But that now after so long toward them I yearn,"
4068,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And that often the thought of them all may return,"
4069,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And that often it makes me weep.”
4070,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
4071,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Then, alas! I was troubled and filled with shame,"
4072,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,As I looked on His face and beheld him fair;
4073,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"For his locks were as gold, and his eyes as a flame;"
4074,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And I knew that one winter had blanched my hair,"
4075,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And that surely my looks were no longer the same
4076,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,As in earlier days they were:
4077,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"For I feared he should mock me and tell them of this,"
4078,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And that even my tears were but scant beside his.
4079,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"O, this thought was a hard one to bear!"
4080,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,
4081,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,But at length I fell dreaming beneath the might
4082,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Of each spell of the Past whence I cared not to start;
4083,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"And I saw Him some time by the flickering light,"
4084,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,As the one in my dream who was playing my part;
4085,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,Till his semblance grew dim and was gone from my sight
4086,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,As a dream of the Past will depart.
4087,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Then the Spirit whose beauty has led me till now,"
4088,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,"Came and breathed a sweet breath on my feverish brow,"
4089,THE SPECTRE OF THE PAST.,And the strain of this verse in my heart.

4298,CHARMED MOMENTS.,The sky is a brilliant enamel;

4300,CHARMED MOMENTS.,The hours are beautiful flowers
4301,CHARMED MOMENTS.,"That pass, and we keep none of them;"
4302,CHARMED MOMENTS.,"They bear not the thing we would cherish,"
4303,CHARMED MOMENTS.,Those beautiful fruitless flowers;

4319,CHARMED MOMENTS.,But little we care to withstand:
4320,CHARMED MOMENTS.,
4321,CHARMED MOMENTS.,How thrill we!--We think that some Spirit

4335,A LIFE-TOMB.,O the house is filled with gloom:
4336,A LIFE-TOMB.,--Is She here dead in my life?
4337,A LIFE-TOMB.,Am I here alive in her tomb?--
4338,A LIFE-TOMB.,
4339,A LIFE-TOMB.,Ah fain am I still to track
4340,A LIFE-TOMB.,And to walk along the ways
4341,A LIFE-TOMB.,Sown with flowers by her feet;
4342,A LIFE-TOMB.,"And to gather, following back,"
4343,A LIFE-TOMB.,All the purple nights and days
4344,A LIFE-TOMB.,"She slew passing; or, half sweet,"
4345,A LIFE-TOMB.,To sit with dull eyes cast

4347,A LIFE-TOMB.,Of things the heart remembers
4348,A LIFE-TOMB.,"Right fair in the heart’s past,"

4351,A LIFE-TOMB.,"Move round about the heart,"
4352,A LIFE-TOMB.,And a love-glow fills the gloom;
4353,A LIFE-TOMB.,And her soul seems to look out
4354,A LIFE-TOMB.,"As from dim and distant eyes,"
4355,A LIFE-TOMB.,And a shade of lips to pout
4356,A LIFE-TOMB.,With some remnant of her sighs.
4357,A LIFE-TOMB.,
4358,A LIFE-TOMB.,"And often too, in the night,"
4359,A LIFE-TOMB.,The flame in famished eyes

4374,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"--Only a fragrant memory, nought,"
4375,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Or anything that’s free:
4376,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,
4377,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,“Give me--O pitying--some power
4378,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,To cease; make me a gentle shower;
4379,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,A hidden fount that murmureth
4380,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,In some sweet glimmer all apart
4381,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,From sounds of living: give me death!
4382,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Or loose me for your love of me;
4383,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,My bosom faileth and my heart
4384,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,No more a prisoner will be

4387,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Shall I not cry to ye aloud
4388,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,O clouds! My spirit was a cloud
4389,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Like one of you,--was free, I say,"
4390,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,To loiter o’er the tremulous lakes
4391,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Loving, to cling upon the wane"
4392,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Of every fair thing that forsakes
4393,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,The light and luxury of day;
4394,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,To bear me over hill and plain
4395,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Upon the winds’ unfooted way:
4396,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,
4397,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Ah, I was fearless then and pure;"
4398,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,And my sight touched all things obscure
4399,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Beneath dim masks of change or sleep:
4400,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,And read the tender meanings writ
4401,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,For full new heavens down in deep
4402,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Horizons, over which stood knit"
4403,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,The storms’ dark brows; I saw what cleaves
4404,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"In the far corners of sun-smiles,"
4405,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,And I could send my breath for miles
4406,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Among the flowers and the leaves.
4407,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,
4408,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"O bosom of my mother Heaven,"
4409,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Was not I purer than the dew?

4411,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Of your own high eternal blue
4412,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Unspotted by one part of earth?
4413,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"O, wherefore this dull flesh that wraps"
4414,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"My sense in shame,--O, why this birth"
4415,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Among hard human sights and mirth!
4416,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Hear now, and draw me back to you."
4417,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Call to me through the silent gaps
4418,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"In some great tempest cloud above,"
4419,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Steal me when, gasping in the laps"
4420,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Of these that sicken me of love,"
4421,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,I lie and think of my lost bliss:
4422,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,O can you not in one long kiss
4423,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Absorb my spirit back to you?
4424,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,
4425,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"But thou, Apollo, who prevailest!"

4428,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Me the most piteous, for the loosing"

4437,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Rather, through hot days, will I hearken"
4438,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"For quick breaths panting in pursuit,"
4439,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,And the swift feet of some sweet fawn
4440,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Crashing among the fallen fruit:
4441,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,And him--making my whole blood blush--
4442,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"I will all languishing beseech,--"
4443,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Crush me, O God, as thou wouldst crush"
4444,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Some fire-fed fruit, some fallen peach,"
4445,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Some swollen skin of purple wine;
4446,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Care not to spare me,--nor refuse me;"
4447,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Take me, to use me or abuse me,"
4448,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,And slay me taking me for thine!--
4449,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"So--till he seize me with a shout,"
4450,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Tear me, and sear me with his breath;"
4451,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Yea, till he tread my heart quite out,"
4452,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,And give me Death!
4453,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,
4454,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,And if not Death!--
4455,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,O all the night I shall be free
4456,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,To steep me and to stifle me
4457,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"In dew, and cool dew-dropping hair,"
4458,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,In every shadowy haunt and lair
4459,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Where most forgetfulness may be;
4460,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"And, all on flame, my soul shall flare"
4461,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Into the chillest of the dark,"
4462,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"And there be quenchéd, spark by spark."
4463,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,To the last faintest spark of me.
4464,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,
4465,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,I will be wasted as a spoil
4466,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,On all things of the woods and winds;
4467,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Earned with no eagerness or toil
4468,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,I will be for the first who finds--
4469,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"A revel for mad zephyr lips,"
4470,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,A soft eternity of sips:
4471,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,I will no sweet of mine detain;
4472,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"But wholly be to them a prey,"
4473,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Used lavishly or cast away
4474,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,For the whole rout of them to drain.
4475,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Or I will give myself to make
4476,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Sport for the green gods of the lake;
4477,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"--All fierce are they with foamy breath,"
4478,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"And rainbow eyes, and watery souls,"
4479,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"Quaint things, half deity, half snake;"
4480,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,"--O, I shall lay me in the shoals"
4481,THE SLAVE OF APOLLO.,Of waves: or any way get Death!--
