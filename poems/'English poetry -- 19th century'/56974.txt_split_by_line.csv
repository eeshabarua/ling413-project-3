265,PAGE,"Above, the smoke curls grey."
266,PAGE,

310,PAGE,"’Tis the wind of ice, the wind of fire,"
311,PAGE,"Of cold despair and of hot desire,"

319,PAGE,I would give anything to stay
320,PAGE,The little wheel that turns in my brain;

332,PAGE,Thwart the mist that hangs i’ the air.
333,PAGE,
334,PAGE,"And o’er, at last, my spirit steals"
335,PAGE,A weary peace; peace that conceals

388,PAGE,He comes; I hear him up the street--
389,PAGE,"Bird of ill omen, flapping wide"
390,PAGE,"The pinion of a printed sheet,"
391,PAGE,His hoarse note scares the eventide.
392,PAGE,"Of slaughter, theft, and suicide"
393,PAGE,He is the herald and the friend;
394,PAGE,Now he vociferates with pride--
395,PAGE,A double murder in Mile End!
396,PAGE,
397,PAGE,A hanging to his soul is sweet;
398,PAGE,His gloating fancy’s fain to bide
399,PAGE,"Where human-freighted vessels meet,"
400,PAGE,And misdirected trains collide.
401,PAGE,"With Shocking Accidents supplied,"
402,PAGE,He tramps the town from end to end.
