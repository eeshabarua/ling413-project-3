531,ACT I,
532,ACT I,_Tallien._ Yet much depends upon him--well you know
533,ACT I,With plausible harangue 'tis his to paint                           35
534,ACT I,Defeat like victory--and blind the mob
535,ACT I,"With truth-mix'd falsehood. They led on by him,"

911,ACT II,"Friendly to tyrants that accurst decree,                            40"
912,ACT II,"Whose influence brooding o'er this hallowed hall,"
913,ACT II,Has chill'd each tongue to silence? Who destroyed
914,ACT II,"The freedom of debate, and carried through"
915,ACT II,"The fatal law, that doom'd the delegates,"
916,ACT II,"Unheard before their equals, to the bar                             45"
917,ACT II,"Where cruelty sat throned, and murder reign'd"
918,ACT II,With her Dumas coequal? Say--thou man
919,ACT II,"Of mighty eloquence, whose law was that?"
920,ACT II,
921,ACT II,_Couthon._ That law was mine. I urged it--I propos'd--
922,ACT II,The voice of France assembled in her sons                           50
923,ACT II,"Assented, though the tame and timid voice"
924,ACT II,Of traitors murmur'd. I advis'd that law--
925,ACT II,I justify it. It was wise and good.
926,ACT II,
927,ACT II,"_Barrere._ Oh, wonderous wise and most convenient too!"
928,ACT II,"I have long mark'd thee, Robespierre--and now                       55"
929,ACT II,Proclaim thee traitor tyrant!                [_Loud applauses._
930,ACT II,
931,ACT II,_Robespierre._                It is well.
932,ACT II,"I am a traitor! oh, that I had fallen"
933,ACT II,"When Regnault lifted high the murderous knife,"
934,ACT II,Regnault the instrument belike of those
935,ACT II,"Who now themselves would fain assassinate,                          60"
936,ACT II,And legalise their murders. I stand here
937,ACT II,An isolated patriot--hemmed around
938,ACT II,By faction's noisy pack; beset and bay'd
939,ACT II,By the foul hell-hounds who know no escape
940,ACT II,"From Justice' outstretch'd arm, but by the force                    65"
941,ACT II,That pierces through her breast.
942,ACT II,
943,ACT II,"[_Murmurs, and shouts of--Down with the Tyrant!_"
944,ACT II,
945,ACT II,"_Robespierre._ Nay, but I will be heard. There was a time"
946,ACT II,"When Robespierre began, the loud applauses"
947,ACT II,Of honest patriots drown'd the honest sound.
948,ACT II,"But times are chang'd, and villainy prevails.                       70"
949,ACT II,
950,ACT II,_Collot d'Herbois._ No--villainy shall fall. France could not brook
951,ACT II,A monarch's sway--sounds the dictator's name
952,ACT II,More soothing to her ear?
953,ACT II,
954,ACT II,_Bourdon l'Oise._         Rattle her chains
955,ACT II,More musically now than when the hand
956,ACT II,Of Brissot forged her fetters; or the crew                          75
957,ACT II,"Of H√©bert thundered out their blasphemies,"
958,ACT II,And Danton talk'd of virtue?
959,ACT II,
960,ACT II,"_Robespierre._               Oh, that Brissot"
961,ACT II,"Were here again to thunder in this hall,"
962,ACT II,"That H√©bert lived, and Danton's giant form"
963,ACT II,Scowl'd once again defiance! so my soul                             80
964,ACT II,Might cope with worthy foes.
965,ACT II,
966,ACT II,"People of France,"
967,ACT II,Hear me! Beneath the vengeance of the law
968,ACT II,Traitors have perish'd countless; more survive:
969,ACT II,The hydra-headed faction lifts anew
970,ACT II,"Her daring front, and fruitful from her wounds,                     85"
971,ACT II,"Cautious from past defects, contrives new wiles"
972,ACT II,Against the sons of Freedom.
973,ACT II,
974,ACT II,_Tallien._                   Freedom lives!
975,ACT II,"Oppression falls--for France has felt her chains,"
976,ACT II,Has burst them too. Who traitor-like stept forth
977,ACT II,Amid the hall of Jacobins to save                                   90
978,ACT II,"Camille Desmoulins, and the venal wretch"
979,ACT II,D'Eglantine?
980,ACT II,
981,ACT II,_Robespierre._ I did--for I thought them honest.
982,ACT II,"And Heaven forefend that Vengeance e'er should strike,"
983,ACT II,Ere justice doom'd the blow.
984,ACT II,
985,ACT II,"_Barrere._                   Traitor, thou didst."
986,ACT II,"Yes, the accomplice of their dark designs,                          95"
987,ACT II,"Awhile didst thou defend them, when the storm"
988,ACT II,"Lower'd at safe distance. When the clouds frown'd darker,"
989,ACT II,Fear'd for yourself and left them to their fate.
990,ACT II,"Oh, I have mark'd thee long, and through the veil"
991,ACT II,"Seen thy foul projects. Yes, ambitious man,                        100"
992,ACT II,"Self-will'd dictator o'er the realm of France,"
993,ACT II,The vengeance thou hast plann'd for patriots
994,ACT II,Falls on thy head. Look how thy brother's deeds
995,ACT II,"Dishonour thine! He the firm patriot,"
996,ACT II,Thou the foul parricide of Liberty!                                105
997,ACT II,
998,ACT II,_Robespierre Junior._ Barrere--attempt not meanly to divide
999,ACT II,"Me from my brother. I partake his guilt,"
1000,ACT II,For I partake his virtue.
1001,ACT II,
1002,ACT II,"_Robespierre._            Brother, by my soul,"
1003,ACT II,"More dear I hold thee to my heart, that thus"
1004,ACT II,With me thou dar'st to tread the dangerous path                    110
1005,ACT II,"Of virtue, than that Nature twined her cords"
1006,ACT II,Of kindred round us.
1007,ACT II,
1008,ACT II,"_Barrere._           Yes, allied in guilt,"
1009,ACT II,"Even as in blood ye are. O, thou worst wretch,"
1010,ACT II,"Thou worse than Sylla! hast thou not proscrib'd,"
1011,ACT II,"Yea, in most foul anticipation slaughter'd                         115"
1012,ACT II,Each patriot representative of France?
1013,ACT II,
1014,ACT II,_Bourdon l'Oise._ Was not the younger Caesar too to reign
1015,ACT II,"O'er all our valiant armies in the south,"
1016,ACT II,And still continue there his merchant wiles?
1017,ACT II,
1018,ACT II,"_Robespierre Junior._ His merchant wiles! Oh, grant me patience,"
1019,ACT II,heaven!                                                        120
1020,ACT II,Was it by merchant wiles I gain'd you back
1021,ACT II,"Toulon, when proudly on her captive towers"
1022,ACT II,Wav'd high the English flag? or fought I then
1023,ACT II,"With merchant wiles, when sword in hand I led"
1024,ACT II,"Your troops to conquest? fought I merchant-like,                   125"
1025,ACT II,"Or barter'd I for victory, when death"
1026,ACT II,"Strode o'er the reeking streets with giant stride,"
1027,ACT II,"And shook his ebon plumes, and sternly smil'd"
1028,ACT II,Amid the bloody banquet? when appall'd
1029,ACT II,The hireling sons of England spread the sail                       130
1030,ACT II,"Of safety, fought I like a merchant then?"
1031,ACT II,"Oh, patience! patience!"
1032,ACT II,
1033,ACT II,_Bourdon l'Oise._       How this younger tyrant
1034,ACT II,Mouths out defiance to us! even so
1035,ACT II,"He had led on the armies of the south,"
1036,ACT II,Till once again the plains of France were drench'd                 135
1037,ACT II,With her best blood.
1038,ACT II,
1039,ACT II,_Collot d'Herbois._  Till once again display'd
1040,ACT II,Lyons' sad tragedy had call'd me forth
1041,ACT II,"The minister of wrath, whilst slaughter by"
1042,ACT II,Had bathed in human blood.
1043,ACT II,
1044,ACT II,"_Dubois Cranc√©._           No wonder, friend,"
1045,ACT II,That we are traitors--that our heads must fall                     140
1046,ACT II,Beneath the axe of death! when Caesar-like
1047,ACT II,"Reigns Robespierre, 'tis wisely done to doom"
1048,ACT II,"The fall of Brutus. Tell me, bloody man,"
1049,ACT II,"Hast thou not parcell'd out deluded France,"
1050,ACT II,"As it had been some province won in fight,                         145"
1051,ACT II,"Between your curst triumvirate? You, Couthon,"
1052,ACT II,Go with my brother to the southern plains;
1053,ACT II,"St. Just, be yours the army of the north;"
1054,ACT II,Meantime I rule at Paris.
1055,ACT II,
1056,ACT II,_Robespierre._            Matchless knave!
1057,ACT II,What--not one blush of conscience on thy cheek--                   150
1058,ACT II,Not one poor blush of truth! most likely tale!
1059,ACT II,"That I who ruined Brissot's towering hopes,"
1060,ACT II,"I who discover'd H√©bert's impious wiles,"
1061,ACT II,"And sharp'd for Danton's recreant neck the axe,"
1062,ACT II,"Should now be traitor! had I been so minded,                       155"
1063,ACT II,Think ye I had destroyed the very men
1064,ACT II,Whose plots resembled mine? bring forth your proofs
1065,ACT II,Of this deep treason. Tell me in whose breast
1066,ACT II,Found ye the fatal scroll? or tell me rather
1067,ACT II,Who forg'd the shameless falsehood?
1068,ACT II,
1069,ACT II,_Collot d'Herbois._                 Ask you proofs?                160
1070,ACT II,"Robespierre, what proofs were ask'd when Brissot died?"
1071,ACT II,
1072,ACT II,_Legendre._ What proofs adduced you when the Danton died?
1073,ACT II,When at the imminent peril of my life
1074,ACT II,"I rose, and fearless of thy frowning brow,"
1075,ACT II,Proclaim'd him guiltless?
1076,ACT II,
1077,ACT II,_Robespierre._            I remember well                          165
1078,ACT II,The fatal day. I do repent me much
1079,ACT II,That I kill'd Caesar and spar'd Antony.
1080,ACT II,But I have been too lenient. I have spared
1081,ACT II,"The stream of blood, and now my own must flow"
1082,ACT II,To fill the current.                         [_Loud applauses._
1083,ACT II,"Triumph not too soon,                         170"
1084,ACT II,Justice may yet be victor.
1085,ACT II,
1086,ACT II,"_Enter ST. JUST, and mounts the Tribune._"
1087,ACT II,
1088,ACT II,_St. Just._ I come from the Committee--charged to speak
1089,ACT II,Of matters of high import. I omit
1090,ACT II,"Their orders. Representatives of France,"
1091,ACT II,Boldly in his own person speaks St. Just                           175
1092,ACT II,What his own heart shall dictate.
1093,ACT II,
1094,ACT II,"_Tallien._                        Hear ye this,"
1095,ACT II,Insulted delegates of France? St. Just
1096,ACT II,From your Committee comes--comes charg'd to speak
1097,ACT II,"Of matters of high import, yet omits"
1098,ACT II,"Their orders! Representatives of France,                           180"
1099,ACT II,"That bold man I denounce, who disobeys"
1100,ACT II,The nation's orders.--I denounce St. Just.   [_Loud applauses._
1101,ACT II,
1102,ACT II,_St. Just._ Hear me!                        [_Violent murmurs._
1103,ACT II,
1104,ACT II,_Robespierre._       He shall be heard!
1105,ACT II,
1106,ACT II,_Bourdon l'Oise._ Must we contaminate this sacred hall
1107,ACT II,With the foul breath of treason?
1108,ACT II,
1109,ACT II,_Collot d'Herbois._              Drag him away!                    185
1110,ACT II,Hence with him to the bar.
1111,ACT II,
1112,ACT II,"_Couthon._                 Oh, just proceedings!"
1113,ACT II,Robespierre prevented liberty of speech--
1114,ACT II,"And Robespierre is a tyrant! Tallien reigns,"
1115,ACT II,He dreads to hear the voice of innocence--
1116,ACT II,And St. Just must be silent!
1117,ACT II,
1118,ACT II,_Legendre._                  Heed we well                          190
1119,ACT II,That justice guide our actions. No light import
1120,ACT II,Attends this day. I move St. Just be heard.
1121,ACT II,
1122,ACT II,_Freron._ Inviolate be the sacred right of man.
1123,ACT II,The freedom of debate.                    [_Violent applauses._
1124,ACT II,
1125,ACT II,"_St. Just._ I may be heard then! much the times are chang'd,       195"
1126,ACT II,When St. Just thanks this hall for hearing him.
1127,ACT II,"Robespierre is call'd a tyrant. Men of France,"
1128,ACT II,Judge not too soon. By popular discontent
1129,ACT II,"Was Aristides driven into exile,"
1130,ACT II,Was Phocion murder'd. Ere ye dare pronounce                        200
1131,ACT II,"Robespierre is guilty, it befits ye well,"
1132,ACT II,"Consider who accuse him. Tallien,"
1133,ACT II,"Bourdon of Oise--the very men denounced,"
1134,ACT II,For that their dark intrigues disturb'd the plan
1135,ACT II,Of government. Legendre the sworn friend                           205
1136,ACT II,"Of Danton, fall'n apostate. Dubois Cranc√©,"
1137,ACT II,He who at Lyons spared the royalists--
1138,ACT II,Collot d'Herbois--
1139,ACT II,
1140,ACT II,_Bourdon l'Oise._  What--shall the traitor rear
1141,ACT II,His head amid our tribune--and blaspheme
1142,ACT II,Each patriot? shall the hireling slave of faction--                210
1143,ACT II,
1144,ACT II,_St. Just._ I am of no one faction. I contend
1145,ACT II,Against all factions.
1146,ACT II,
1147,ACT II,_Tallien._            I espouse the cause
1148,ACT II,Of truth. Robespierre on yester morn pronounced
1149,ACT II,Upon his own authority a report.
1150,ACT II,To-day St. Just comes down. St. Just neglects                      215
1151,ACT II,"What the Committee orders, and harangues"
1152,ACT II,From his own will. O citizens of France
1153,ACT II,I weep for you--I weep for my poor country--
1154,ACT II,"I tremble for the cause of Liberty,"
1155,ACT II,"When individuals shall assume the sway,                            220"
1156,ACT II,And with more insolence than kingly pride
1157,ACT II,Rule the Republic.
1158,ACT II,
1159,ACT II,"_Billaud Varennes._ Shudder, ye representatives of France,"
1160,ACT II,Shudder with horror. Henriot commands
1161,ACT II,"The marshall'd force of Paris. Henriot,                            225"
1162,ACT II,"Foul parricide--the sworn ally of H√©bert,"
1163,ACT II,Denounced by all--upheld by Robespierre.
1164,ACT II,"Who spar'd La Valette? who promoted him,"
1165,ACT II,Stain'd with the deep dye of nobility?
1166,ACT II,Who to an ex-peer gave the high command?                           230
1167,ACT II,Who screen'd from justice the rapacious thief?
1168,ACT II,Who cast in chains the friends of Liberty?
1169,ACT II,"Robespierre, the self-stil'd patriot Robespierre--"
1170,ACT II,"Robespierre, allied with villain Daubign√©--"
1171,ACT II,"Robespierre, the foul arch-tyrant Robespierre.                     235"
1172,ACT II,
1173,ACT II,_Bourdon l'Oise._ He talks of virtue--of morality--
1174,ACT II,Consistent patriot! he Daubign√©'s friend!
1175,ACT II,"Henriot's supporter virtuous! preach of virtue,"
1176,ACT II,"Yet league with villains, for with Robespierre"
1177,ACT II,Villains alone ally. Thou art a tyrant!                            240
1178,ACT II,"I stile thee tyrant, Robespierre!            [_Loud applauses._"
1179,ACT II,
1180,ACT II,_Robespierre._ Take back the name. Ye citizens of France--
1181,ACT II,
1182,ACT II,[_Violent clamour. Cries of--Down with the Tyrant!_
1183,ACT II,
1184,ACT II,_Tallien._ Oppression falls. The traitor stands appall'd--
1185,ACT II,Guilt's iron fangs engrasp his shrinking soul--
1186,ACT II,He hears assembled France denounce his crimes!                     245
1187,ACT II,He sees the mask torn from his secret sins--
1188,ACT II,He trembles on the precipice of fate.
1189,ACT II,Fall'n guilty tyrant! murder'd by thy rage
1190,ACT II,How many an innocent victim's blood has stain'd
1191,ACT II,Fair freedom's altar! Sylla-like thy hand                          250
1192,ACT II,"Mark'd down the virtues, that, thy foes removed,"
1193,ACT II,"Perpetual Dictator thou might'st reign,"
1194,ACT II,"And tyrannize o'er France, and call it freedom!"
1195,ACT II,Long time in timid guilt the traitor plann'd
1196,ACT II,His fearful wiles--success emboldened sin--                        255
1197,ACT II,And his stretch'd arm had grasp'd the diadem
1198,ACT II,"Ere now, but that the coward's heart recoil'd,"
1199,ACT II,"Lest France awak'd should rouse her from her dream,"
1200,ACT II,"And call aloud for vengeance. He, like Caesar,"
1201,ACT II,"With rapid step urged on his bold career,                          260"
1202,ACT II,"Even to the summit of ambitious power,"
1203,ACT II,And deem'd the name of King alone was wanting.
1204,ACT II,Was it for this we hurl'd proud Capet down?
1205,ACT II,Is it for this we wage eternal war
1206,ACT II,"Against the tyrant horde of murderers,                             265"
1207,ACT II,The crown√©d cockatrices whose foul venom
1208,ACT II,Infects all Europe? was it then for this
1209,ACT II,"We swore to guard our liberty with life,"
1210,ACT II,That Robespierre should reign? the spirit of freedom
1211,ACT II,Is not yet sunk so low. The glowing flame                          270
1212,ACT II,That animates each honest Frenchman's heart
1213,ACT II,"Not yet extinguish'd. I invoke thy shade,"
1214,ACT II,Immortal Brutus! I too wear a dagger;
1215,ACT II,"And if the representatives of France,"
1216,ACT II,"Through fear or favour, should delay the sword                     275"
1217,ACT II,"Of justice, Tallien emulates thy virtues;"
1218,ACT II,"Tallien, like Brutus, lifts the avenging arm;"
1219,ACT II,Tallien shall save his country.           [_Violent applauses._
1220,ACT II,
1221,ACT II,_Billaud Varennes._             I demand
1222,ACT II,The arrest of all the traitors. Memorable
1223,ACT II,Will be this day for France.
1224,ACT II,
1225,ACT II,_Robespierre._               Yes! Memorable                        280
1226,ACT II,This day will be for France--for villains triumph.
1227,ACT II,
1228,ACT II,_Lebas._ I will not share in this day's damning guilt.
1229,ACT II,Condemn me too.            [_Great cry--Down with the Tyrants!_

1240,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1241,SCENE CONTINUES.,"_Collot d'Herbois._ Caesar is fall'n! The baneful tree of Java,"
1242,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Whose death-distilling boughs dropt poisonous dew,"
1243,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Is rooted from its base. This worse than Cromwell,"
1244,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The austere, the self-denying Robespierre,"
1245,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Even in this hall, where once with terror mute                       5"
1246,SCENE CONTINUES.,"We listen'd to the hypocrite's harangues,"
1247,SCENE CONTINUES.,Has heard his doom.
1248,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1249,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Billaud Varennes._ Yet must we not suppose
1250,SCENE CONTINUES.,The tyrant will fall tamely. His sworn hireling
1251,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Henriot, the daring desperate Henriot,"
1252,SCENE CONTINUES.,Commands the force of Paris. I denounce him.                        10
1253,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1254,SCENE CONTINUES.,"_Freron._ I denounce Fleuriot too, the mayor of Paris."
1255,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1256,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Enter DUBOIS CRANC√â._
1257,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1258,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Dubois Cranc√©._ Robespierre is rescued. Henriot at the head
1259,SCENE CONTINUES.,Of the arm'd force has rescued the fierce tyrant.
1260,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1261,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Collot d'Herbois._ Ring the tocsin--call all the citizens
1262,SCENE CONTINUES.,To save their country--never yet has Paris                          15
1263,SCENE CONTINUES.,Forsook the representatives of France.
1264,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1265,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Tallien._ It is the hour of danger. I propose
1266,SCENE CONTINUES.,This sitting be made permanent.              [_Loud applauses._
1267,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1268,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Collot d'Herbois._ The National Convention shall remain
1269,SCENE CONTINUES.,Firm at its post.                                                   20
1270,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1271,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Enter a_ Messenger.
1272,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1273,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Messenger._ Robespierre has reach'd the Commune. They espouse
1274,SCENE CONTINUES.,The tyrant's cause. St. Just is up in arms!
1275,SCENE CONTINUES.,St. Just--the young ambitious bold St. Just
1276,SCENE CONTINUES.,Harangues the mob. The sanguinary Couthon
1277,SCENE CONTINUES.,Thirsts for your blood.                        [_Tocsin rings._     25
1278,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1279,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Tallien._ These tyrants are in arms against the law:
1280,SCENE CONTINUES.,Outlaw the rebels.
1281,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1282,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Enter MERLIN OF DOUAY._
1283,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1284,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Merlin._ Health to the representatives of France!
1285,SCENE CONTINUES.,I past this moment through the arm√©d force--
1286,SCENE CONTINUES.,"They ask'd my name--and when they heard a delegate,                 30"
1287,SCENE CONTINUES.,Swore I was not the friend of France.
1288,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1289,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Collot d'Herbois._ The tyrants threaten us as when they turn'd
1290,SCENE CONTINUES.,The cannon's mouth on Brissot.
1291,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1292,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Enter another_ Messenger.
1293,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1294,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Second Messenger._ Vivier harangues the Jacobins--the Club
1295,SCENE CONTINUES.,Espouse the cause of Robespierre.                                   35
1296,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1297,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Enter another_ Messenger.
1298,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1299,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Third Messenger._ All's lost--the tyrant triumphs. Henriot leads
1300,SCENE CONTINUES.,The soldiers to his aid.--Already I hear
1301,SCENE CONTINUES.,The rattling cannon destined to surround
1302,SCENE CONTINUES.,This sacred hall.
1303,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1304,SCENE CONTINUES.,"_Tallien._        Why, we will die like men then."
1305,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The representatives of France dare death,                           40"
1306,SCENE CONTINUES.,When duty steels their bosoms.               [_Loud applauses._
1307,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1308,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Tallien (addressing the galleries)._ Citizens!
1309,SCENE CONTINUES.,France is insulted in her delegates--
1310,SCENE CONTINUES.,The majesty of the Republic is insulted--
1311,SCENE CONTINUES.,Tyrants are up in arms. An arm√©d force
1312,SCENE CONTINUES.,Threats the Convention. The Convention swears                       45
1313,SCENE CONTINUES.,"To die, or save the country!"
1314,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1315,SCENE CONTINUES.,[_Violent applauses from the galleries._
1316,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1317,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Citizen (from above)._      We too swear
1318,SCENE CONTINUES.,"To die, or save the country. Follow me."
1319,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1320,SCENE CONTINUES.,[_All the men quit the galleries._
1321,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1322,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Enter another_ Messenger.
1323,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1324,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Fourth Messenger._ Henriot is taken!        [_Loud applauses._
1325,SCENE CONTINUES.,Three of your brave soldiers
1326,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Swore they would seize the rebel slave of tyrants,"
1327,SCENE CONTINUES.,Or perish in the attempt. As he patroll'd                           50
1328,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The streets of Paris, stirring up the mob,"
1329,SCENE CONTINUES.,They seiz'd him.                                  [_Applauses._
1330,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1331,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Billaud Varennes._ Let the names of these brave men
1332,SCENE CONTINUES.,Live to the future day.
1333,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1334,SCENE CONTINUES.,"_Enter BOURDON L'OISE, sword in hand._"
1335,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1336,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Bourdon l'Oise._       I have clear'd the Commune.
1337,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1338,SCENE CONTINUES.,[_Applauses._
1339,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1340,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Through the throng I rush'd,"
1341,SCENE CONTINUES.,Brandishing my good sword to drench its blade                       55
1342,SCENE CONTINUES.,Deep in the tyrant's heart. The timid rebels
1343,SCENE CONTINUES.,Gave way. I met the soldiery--I spake
1344,SCENE CONTINUES.,Of the dictator's crimes--of patriots chain'd
1345,SCENE CONTINUES.,In dark deep dungeons by his lawless rage--
1346,SCENE CONTINUES.,Of knaves secure beneath his fostering power.                       60
1347,SCENE CONTINUES.,I spake of Liberty. Their honest hearts
1348,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Caught the warm flame. The general shout burst forth,"
1349,SCENE CONTINUES.,'Live the Convention--Down with Robespierre!'     [_Applauses._
1350,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1351,SCENE CONTINUES.,(_Shouts from without--Down with the Tyrant!_)
1352,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1353,SCENE CONTINUES.,"_Tallien._ I hear, I hear the soul-inspiring sounds,"
1354,SCENE CONTINUES.,France shall be saved! her generous sons attached                   65
1355,SCENE CONTINUES.,"To principles, not persons, spurn the idol"
1356,SCENE CONTINUES.,"They worshipp'd once. Yes, Robespierre shall fall"
1357,SCENE CONTINUES.,As Capet fell! Oh! never let us deem
1358,SCENE CONTINUES.,"That France shall crouch beneath a tyrant's throne,"
1359,SCENE CONTINUES.,That the almighty people who have broke                             70
1360,SCENE CONTINUES.,"On their oppressors' heads the oppressive chain,"
1361,SCENE CONTINUES.,Will court again their fetters! easier were it
1362,SCENE CONTINUES.,"To hurl the cloud-capt mountain from its base,"
1363,SCENE CONTINUES.,Than force the bonds of slavery upon men
1364,SCENE CONTINUES.,Determined to be free!                            [_Applauses._     75
1365,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1366,SCENE CONTINUES.,"_Enter LEGENDRE--a pistol in one hand, keys in the other._"
1367,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1368,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Legendre (flinging down the keys)._ So--let the mutinous Jacobins
1369,SCENE CONTINUES.,meet now
1370,SCENE CONTINUES.,In the open air.                             [_Loud applauses._
1371,SCENE CONTINUES.,A factious turbulent party
1372,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Lording it o'er the state since Danton died,"
1373,SCENE CONTINUES.,And with him the Cordeliers.--A hireling band
1374,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of loud-tongued orators controull'd the Club,                       80"
1375,SCENE CONTINUES.,And bade them bow the knee to Robespierre.
1376,SCENE CONTINUES.,Vivier has 'scaped me. Curse his coward heart--
1377,SCENE CONTINUES.,"This fate-fraught tube of Justice in my hand,"
1378,SCENE CONTINUES.,I rush'd into the hall. He mark'd mine eye
1379,SCENE CONTINUES.,"That beam'd its patriot anger, and flash'd full                     85"
1380,SCENE CONTINUES.,With death-denouncing meaning. 'Mid the throng
1381,SCENE CONTINUES.,"He mingled. I pursued--but stay'd my hand,"
1382,SCENE CONTINUES.,Lest haply I might shed the innocent blood.       [_Applauses._
1383,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1384,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Freron._ They took from me my ticket of admission--
1385,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Expell'd me from their sittings.--Now, forsooth,                    90"
1386,SCENE CONTINUES.,Humbled and trembling re-insert my name.
1387,SCENE CONTINUES.,But Freron enters not the Club again
1388,SCENE CONTINUES.,"'Till it be purged of guilt:--'till, purified"
1389,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of tyrants and of traitors, honest men"
1390,SCENE CONTINUES.,May breathe the air in safety.          [_Shouts from without._     95
1391,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1392,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Barrere._ What means this uproar! if the tyrant band
1393,SCENE CONTINUES.,Should gain the people once again to rise--
1394,SCENE CONTINUES.,We are as dead!
1395,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1396,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Tallien._      And wherefore fear we death?
1397,SCENE CONTINUES.,Did Brutus fear it? or the Grecian friends
1398,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Who buried in Hipparchus' breast the sword,                        100"
1399,SCENE CONTINUES.,"And died triumphant? Caesar should fear death,"
1400,SCENE CONTINUES.,Brutus must scorn the bugbear.
1401,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1402,SCENE CONTINUES.,(_Shouts from without--Live the Convention!--Down with the Tyrants!_)
1403,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1404,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Tallien._                     Hark! again
1405,SCENE CONTINUES.,The sounds of honest Freedom!
1406,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1407,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Enter_ Deputies _from the_ Sections.
1408,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1409,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Citizen._ Citizens! representatives of France!
1410,SCENE CONTINUES.,Hold on your steady course. The men of Paris                       105
1411,SCENE CONTINUES.,Espouse your cause. The men of Paris swear
1412,SCENE CONTINUES.,They will defend the delegates of Freedom.
1413,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1414,SCENE CONTINUES.,"_Tallien._ Hear ye this, Colleagues? hear ye this, my brethren?"
1415,SCENE CONTINUES.,And does no thrill of joy pervade your breasts?
1416,SCENE CONTINUES.,My bosom bounds to rapture. I have seen                            110
1417,SCENE CONTINUES.,The sons of France shake off the tyrant yoke;
1418,SCENE CONTINUES.,"I have, as much as lies in mine own arm,"
1419,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Hurl'd down the usurper.--Come death when it will,"
1420,SCENE CONTINUES.,I have lived long enough.                    [_Shouts without._
1421,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1422,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Barrere._ Hark! how the noise increases! through the gloom        115
1423,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of the still evening--harbinger of death,"
1424,SCENE CONTINUES.,Rings the tocsin! the dreadful generale
1425,SCENE CONTINUES.,Thunders through Paris--
1426,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1427,SCENE CONTINUES.,[_Cry without--Down with the Tyrant!_
1428,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1429,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Enter LECOINTRE._
1430,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1431,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Lecointre._ So may eternal justice blast the foes
1432,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of France! so perish all the tyrant brood,                         120"
1433,SCENE CONTINUES.,"As Robespierre has perish'd! Citizens,"
1434,SCENE CONTINUES.,Caesar is taken.                [_Loud and repeated applauses._
1435,SCENE CONTINUES.,I marvel not that with such fearless front
1436,SCENE CONTINUES.,"He braved our vengeance, and with angry eye"
1437,SCENE CONTINUES.,Scowled round the hall defiance. He relied                         125
1438,SCENE CONTINUES.,"On Henriot's aid--the Commune's villain friendship,"
1439,SCENE CONTINUES.,And Henriot's _boughten_ succours. Ye have heard
1440,SCENE CONTINUES.,How Henriot rescued him--how with open arms
1441,SCENE CONTINUES.,The Commune welcom'd in the rebel tyrant--
1442,SCENE CONTINUES.,"How Fleuriot aided, and seditious Vivier                           130"
1443,SCENE CONTINUES.,Stirr'd up the Jacobins. All had been lost--
1444,SCENE CONTINUES.,The representatives of France had perish'd--
1445,SCENE CONTINUES.,Freedom had sunk beneath the tyrant arm
1446,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of this foul parricide, but that her spirit"
1447,SCENE CONTINUES.,Inspir'd the men of Paris. Henriot call'd                          135
1448,SCENE CONTINUES.,"'To arms' in vain, whilst Bourdon's patriot voice"
1449,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Breathed eloquence, and o'er the Jacobins"
1450,SCENE CONTINUES.,Legendre frown'd dismay. The tyrants fled--
1451,SCENE CONTINUES.,They reach'd the H√¥tel. We gather'd round--we call'd
1452,SCENE CONTINUES.,"For vengeance! Long time, obstinate in despair,                    140"
1453,SCENE CONTINUES.,With knives they hack'd around them. 'Till foreboding
1454,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The sentence of the law, the clamorous cry"
1455,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of joyful thousands hailing their destruction,"
1456,SCENE CONTINUES.,Each sought by suicide to escape the dread
1457,SCENE CONTINUES.,Of death. Lebas succeeded. From the window                         145
1458,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Leapt the younger Robespierre, but his fractur'd limb"
1459,SCENE CONTINUES.,Forbade to escape. The self-will'd dictator
1460,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Plunged often the keen knife in his dark breast,"
1461,SCENE CONTINUES.,Yet impotent to die. He lives all mangled
1462,SCENE CONTINUES.,By his own tremulous hand! All gash'd and gored                    150
1463,SCENE CONTINUES.,He lives to taste the bitterness of death.
1464,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Even now they meet their doom. The bloody Couthon,"
1465,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The fierce St. Just, even now attend their tyrant"
1466,SCENE CONTINUES.,To fall beneath the axe. I saw the torches
1467,SCENE CONTINUES.,Flash on their visages a dreadful light--                          155
1468,SCENE CONTINUES.,I saw them whilst the black blood roll'd adown
1469,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Each stern face, even then with dauntless eye"
1470,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Scowl round contemptuous, dying as they lived,"
1471,SCENE CONTINUES.,Fearless of fate!               [_Loud and repeated applauses._
1472,SCENE CONTINUES.,
1473,SCENE CONTINUES.,_Barrere mounts the Tribune._ For ever hallowed be this glorious
1474,SCENE CONTINUES.,"day,                                                           160"
1475,SCENE CONTINUES.,"When Freedom, bursting her oppressive chain,"
1476,SCENE CONTINUES.,Tramples on the oppressor. When the tyrant
1477,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Hurl'd from his blood-cemented throne, by the arm"
1478,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of the almighty people, meets the death"
1479,SCENE CONTINUES.,He plann'd for thousands. Oh! my sickening heart                   165
1480,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Has sunk within me, when the various woes"
1481,SCENE CONTINUES.,Of my brave country crowded o'er my brain
1482,SCENE CONTINUES.,"In ghastly numbers--when assembled hordes,"
1483,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Dragg'd from their hovels by despotic power,"
1484,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Rush'd o'er her frontiers, plunder'd her fair hamlets,             170"
1485,SCENE CONTINUES.,"And sack'd her populous towns, and drench'd with blood"
1486,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The reeking fields of Flanders.--When within,"
1487,SCENE CONTINUES.,Upon her vitals prey'd the rankling tooth
1488,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of treason; and oppression, giant form,"
1489,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Trampling on freedom, left the alternative                         175"
1490,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of slavery, or of death. Even from that day,"
1491,SCENE CONTINUES.,"When, on the guilty Capet, I pronounced"
1492,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The doom of injured France, has faction reared"
1493,SCENE CONTINUES.,Her hated head amongst us. Roland preach'd
1494,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of mercy--the uxorious dotard Roland,                              180"
1495,SCENE CONTINUES.,The woman-govern'd Roland durst aspire
1496,SCENE CONTINUES.,"To govern France; and Petion talk'd of virtue,"
1497,SCENE CONTINUES.,"And Vergniaud's eloquence, like the honeyed tongue"
1498,SCENE CONTINUES.,Of some soft Syren wooed us to destruction.
1499,SCENE CONTINUES.,We triumphed over these. On the same scaffold                      185
1500,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Where the last Louis pour'd his guilty blood,"
1501,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Fell Brissot's head, the womb of darksome treasons,"
1502,SCENE CONTINUES.,"And Orleans, villain kinsman of the Capet,"
1503,SCENE CONTINUES.,"And H√©bert's atheist crew, whose maddening hand"
1504,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Hurl'd down the altars of the living God,                          190"
1505,SCENE CONTINUES.,With all the infidel's intolerance.
1506,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The last worst traitor triumphed--triumph'd long,"
1507,SCENE CONTINUES.,Secur'd by matchless villainy--by turns
1508,SCENE CONTINUES.,Defending and deserting each accomplice
1509,SCENE CONTINUES.,As interest prompted. In the goodly soil                           195
1510,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Of Freedom, the foul tree of treason struck"
1511,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Its deep-fix'd roots, and dropt the dews of death"
1512,SCENE CONTINUES.,On all who slumber'd in its specious shade.
1513,SCENE CONTINUES.,He wove the web of treachery. He caught
1514,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The listening crowd by his wild eloquence,                         200"
1515,SCENE CONTINUES.,"His cool ferocity that persuaded murder,"
1516,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Even whilst it spake of mercy!--never, never"
1517,SCENE CONTINUES.,Shall this regenerated country wear
1518,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The despot yoke. Though myriads round assail,"
1519,SCENE CONTINUES.,And with worse fury urge this new crusade                          205
1520,SCENE CONTINUES.,Than savages have known; though the leagued despots
1521,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Depopulate all Europe, so to pour"
1522,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The accumulated mass upon our coasts,"
1523,SCENE CONTINUES.,"Sublime amid the storm shall France arise,"
1524,SCENE CONTINUES.,And like the rock amid surrounding waves                           210
1525,SCENE CONTINUES.,Repel the rushing ocean.--She shall wield
1526,SCENE CONTINUES.,The thunder-bolt of vengeance--she shall blast
1527,SCENE CONTINUES.,"The despot's pride, and liberate the world!"

2658,ACT THE SECOND,
2659,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._ Thrice you have sav'd my life. Once in the battle
2660,ACT THE SECOND,"You gave it me, next rescued me from suicide,"

2666,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._                     Good Ferdinand!
2667,ACT THE SECOND,Why this to me? It is enough you know it.
2668,ACT THE SECOND,
2669,ACT THE SECOND,"_Ferdinand._ A common trick of gratitude, my lord!"
2670,ACT THE SECOND,Seeking to ease her own full heart.
2671,ACT THE SECOND,
2672,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._                           Enough.
2673,ACT THE SECOND,A debt repay'd ceases to be a debt.                                 10
2674,ACT THE SECOND,You have it in your power to serve me greatly.
2675,ACT THE SECOND,
2676,ACT THE SECOND,"_Ferdinand._ As how, my lord? I pray you name the thing!"
2677,ACT THE SECOND,I would climb up an ice-glaz'd precipice

2683,ACT THE SECOND,"Have you a son, my lord?"

2686,ACT THE SECOND,"Ferdinand! you are a man, and know this world."
2687,ACT THE SECOND,I told you what I wish'd--now for the truth!

2703,ACT THE SECOND,"Wear a quaint garment, make mysterious antics."
2704,ACT THE SECOND,

2708,ACT THE SECOND,"She has no faith in Holy Church, 'tis true."
2709,ACT THE SECOND,Her lover school'd her in some newer nonsense:                      30

2712,ACT THE SECOND,"Shivers, and cannot keep the tears in her eye."
2713,ACT THE SECOND,Such ones do love the marvellous too well
2714,ACT THE SECOND,Not to believe it. We will wind her up                              35
2715,ACT THE SECOND,"With a strange music, that she knows not of,"
2716,ACT THE SECOND,"With fumes of frankincense, and mummery--"
2717,ACT THE SECOND,"Then leave, as one sure token of his death,"
2718,ACT THE SECOND,"That portrait, which from off the dead man's neck"
2719,ACT THE SECOND,"I bade thee take, the trophy of thy conquest.                       40"
2720,ACT THE SECOND,
2721,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand (with hesitation)._ Just now I should have cursed the

2723,ACT THE SECOND,"You could ask aught, my lord! and I refuse."
2724,ACT THE SECOND,But this I cannot do.
2725,ACT THE SECOND,
2726,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._             Where lies your scruple?

2733,ACT THE SECOND,Well--and what next?
2734,ACT THE SECOND,
2735,ACT THE SECOND,"_Ferdinand (stammering)._ Next, next--my lord!"
2736,ACT THE SECOND,"You know you told me that the lady loved you,"
2737,ACT THE SECOND,Had loved you with incautious tenderness.

2739,ACT THE SECOND,"Return'd, yourself, and she, and an unborn babe,"

2753,ACT THE SECOND,"I can bear much, yes, very much from you."
2754,ACT THE SECOND,But there's a point where sufferance is meanness!
2755,ACT THE SECOND,"I am no villain, never kill'd for hire.                             60"
2756,ACT THE SECOND,My gratitude----
2757,ACT THE SECOND,
2758,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio._        O! aye, your gratitude!"
2759,ACT THE SECOND,'Twas a well-sounding word--what have you done with it?
2760,ACT THE SECOND,
2761,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._ Who proffers his past favours for my virtue
2762,ACT THE SECOND,"Tries to o'erreach me, is a very sharper,"
2763,ACT THE SECOND,"And should not speak of gratitude, my lord!                         65"
2764,ACT THE SECOND,I knew not 'twas your brother!
2765,ACT THE SECOND,
2766,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio (evidently alarmed)._  And who told you?
2767,ACT THE SECOND,
2768,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._ He himself told me.
2769,ACT THE SECOND,
2770,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._                        Ha! you talk'd with him?
2771,ACT THE SECOND,"And those, the two Morescoes, that went with you?"
2772,ACT THE SECOND,
2773,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._ Both fell in a night-brawl at Malaga.
2774,ACT THE SECOND,
2775,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio (in a low voice)._ My brother!
2776,ACT THE SECOND,
2777,ACT THE SECOND,"_Ferdinand._                           Yes, my lord! I could not"
2778,ACT THE SECOND,tell you:                                                       70
2779,ACT THE SECOND,"I thrust away the thought, it drove me wild."
2780,ACT THE SECOND,"But listen to me now. I pray you, listen!"
2781,ACT THE SECOND,
2782,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._ Villain! no more! I'll hear no more of it.
2783,ACT THE SECOND,
2784,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._ My lord! it much imports your future safety
2785,ACT THE SECOND,That you should hear it.
2786,ACT THE SECOND,
2787,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio (turning off from Ferdinand)._ Am I not a man?              75
2788,ACT THE SECOND,'Tis as it should be! Tut--the deed itself
2789,ACT THE SECOND,Was idle--and these after-pangs still idler!
2790,ACT THE SECOND,
2791,ACT THE SECOND,"_Ferdinand._ We met him in the very place you mention'd,"
2792,ACT THE SECOND,Hard by a grove of firs.
2793,ACT THE SECOND,
2794,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._                Enough! enough!
2795,ACT THE SECOND,
2796,ACT THE SECOND,"_Ferdinand._ He fought us valiantly, and wounded all;               80"
2797,ACT THE SECOND,"In fine, compell'd a parley!"
2798,ACT THE SECOND,
2799,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio (sighing as if lost in thought)._ Albert! Brother!
2800,ACT THE SECOND,
2801,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._ He offer'd me his purse.
2802,ACT THE SECOND,
2803,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._                             Yes?
2804,ACT THE SECOND,
2805,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._                               Yes! I spurn'd it.
2806,ACT THE SECOND,He promis'd us I know not what--in vain!
2807,ACT THE SECOND,"Then with a look and voice which overaw'd me,"
2808,ACT THE SECOND,"He said--What mean you, friends? My life is dear.                   85"
2809,ACT THE SECOND,I have a brother and a promised wife
2810,ACT THE SECOND,"Who make life dear to me, and if I fall"
2811,ACT THE SECOND,That brother will roam earth and hell for vengeance.
2812,ACT THE SECOND,There was a likeness in his face to yours.
2813,ACT THE SECOND,"I ask'd his brother's name; he said, Osorio,                        90"
2814,ACT THE SECOND,Son of Lord Velez! I had well-nigh fainted!
2815,ACT THE SECOND,"At length I said (if that indeed I said it,"
2816,ACT THE SECOND,"And that no spirit made my tongue his organ),"
2817,ACT THE SECOND,"That woman is now pregnant by that brother,"
2818,ACT THE SECOND,"And he the man who sent us to destroy you,                          95"
2819,ACT THE SECOND,"He drove a thrust at me in rage. I told him,"
2820,ACT THE SECOND,He wore her portrait round his neck--he look'd
2821,ACT THE SECOND,As he had been made of the rock that propp'd him back;
2822,ACT THE SECOND,"Ay, just as you look now--only less ghastly!"
2823,ACT THE SECOND,"At last recovering from his trance, he threw                       100"
2824,ACT THE SECOND,"His sword away, and bade us take his life--"
2825,ACT THE SECOND,It was not worth his keeping.
2826,ACT THE SECOND,
2827,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._                     And you kill'd him?
2828,ACT THE SECOND,O blood-hounds! may eternal wrath flame round you!
2829,ACT THE SECOND,He was the image of the Deity.                      [_A pause._
2830,ACT THE SECOND,It seizes me--by Hell! I will go on!                               105
2831,ACT THE SECOND,"What? would'st thou stop, man? thy pale looks won't save thee!"

2839,ACT THE SECOND,
2840,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio._ O this unutterable dying away here,                      110"
2841,ACT THE SECOND,This sickness of the heart!                         [_A pause._
2842,ACT THE SECOND,What if I went
2843,ACT THE SECOND,"And liv'd in a hollow tomb, and fed on weeds?"
2844,ACT THE SECOND,Ay! that's the road to heaven! O fool! fool! fool!  [_A pause._
2845,ACT THE SECOND,What have I done but that which nature destin'd
2846,ACT THE SECOND,Or the blind elements stirr'd up within me?                        115
2847,ACT THE SECOND,"If good were meant, why were we made these beings?"
2848,ACT THE SECOND,And if not meant----
2849,ACT THE SECOND,

2851,ACT THE SECOND,
2852,ACT THE SECOND,"[_OSORIO starts, looks at him wildly, then, after a"

2854,ACT THE SECOND,into a smile._
2855,ACT THE SECOND,
2856,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio._ A gust of the soul! i'faith, it overset me."
2857,ACT THE SECOND,O 'twas all folly--all! idle as laughter!
2858,ACT THE SECOND,"Now, Ferdinand, I swear that thou shalt aid me.                    120"
2859,ACT THE SECOND,
2860,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand (in a low voice)._ I'll perish first! Shame on my

2862,ACT THE SECOND,That I must slink away from wickedness
2863,ACT THE SECOND,Like a cow'd dog!
2864,ACT THE SECOND,

2866,ACT THE SECOND,
2867,ACT THE SECOND,"_Ferdinand._ Some of your servants know me, I am certain."
2868,ACT THE SECOND,
2869,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._ There's some sense in that scruple; but we'll mask you.  125
2870,ACT THE SECOND,
2871,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._ They'll know my gait. But stay! of late I have
2872,ACT THE SECOND,watch'd
2873,ACT THE SECOND,"A stranger that lives nigh, still picking weeds,"
2874,ACT THE SECOND,"Now in the swamp, now on the walls of the ruin,"

2877,ACT THE SECOND,"I have watch'd him at it morning-tide and noon,"
2878,ACT THE SECOND,"Once in the moonlight. Then I stood so near,"

2880,ACT THE SECOND,"Some gaunt slave, prowling out for dark employments."
2881,ACT THE SECOND,
2882,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._ What may his name be?
2883,ACT THE SECOND,
2884,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._                    That I cannot tell you.            135
2885,ACT THE SECOND,Only Francesco bade an officer
2886,ACT THE SECOND,"Speak in your name, as lord of this domain."
2887,ACT THE SECOND,"So he was question'd, who and what he was."
2888,ACT THE SECOND,"This was his answer: Say to the Lord Osorio,"

2893,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._               Aye--all of him is strange.
2894,ACT THE SECOND,He call'd himself a Christian--yet he wears
2895,ACT THE SECOND,"The Moorish robe, as if he courted death."
2896,ACT THE SECOND,
2897,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._ Where does this wizard live?
2898,ACT THE SECOND,
2899,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand (pointing to a distance)._ You see that brooklet?
2900,ACT THE SECOND,Trace its course backward thro' a narrow opening                   145
2901,ACT THE SECOND,It leads you to the place.
2902,ACT THE SECOND,
2903,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._                  How shall I know it?
2904,ACT THE SECOND,
2905,ACT THE SECOND,_Ferdinand._ You can't mistake. It is a small green dale
2906,ACT THE SECOND,"Built all around with high off-sloping hills,"
2907,ACT THE SECOND,And from its shape our peasants aptly call it
2908,ACT THE SECOND,"The Giant's Cradle. There's a lake in the midst,                   150"
2909,ACT THE SECOND,"And round its banks tall wood, that branches over"
2910,ACT THE SECOND,And makes a kind of faery forest grow
2911,ACT THE SECOND,Down in the water. At the further end
2912,ACT THE SECOND,A puny cataract falls on the lake;
2913,ACT THE SECOND,And there (a curious sight) you see its shadow                     155
2914,ACT THE SECOND,"For ever curling, like a wreath of smoke,"
2915,ACT THE SECOND,Up through the foliage of those faery trees.
2916,ACT THE SECOND,His cot stands opposite--you cannot miss it.
2917,ACT THE SECOND,Some three yards up the hill a mountain ash
2918,ACT THE SECOND,Stretches its lower boughs and scarlet clusters                    160
2919,ACT THE SECOND,O'er the new thatch.
2920,ACT THE SECOND,
2921,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._            I shall not fail to find it.

2931,ACT THE SECOND,_ALBERT and MAURICE._
2932,ACT THE SECOND,
2933,ACT THE SECOND,"_Albert._ He doth believe himself an iron soul,"
2934,ACT THE SECOND,And therefore puts he on an iron outward
2935,ACT THE SECOND,And those same mock habiliments of strength
2936,ACT THE SECOND,Hide his own weakness from himself.
2937,ACT THE SECOND,
2938,ACT THE SECOND,_Maurice._                          His weakness!                  165
2939,ACT THE SECOND,"Come, come, speak out! Your brother is a villain!"
2940,ACT THE SECOND,"Yet all the wealth, power, influence, which is yours"
2941,ACT THE SECOND,You suffer him to hold!
2942,ACT THE SECOND,
2943,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert._               Maurice! dear Maurice!
2944,ACT THE SECOND,That my return involved Osorio's death
2945,ACT THE SECOND,I trust would give me an unmingl'd pang--                          170
2946,ACT THE SECOND,Yet bearable. But when I see my father
2947,ACT THE SECOND,Strewing his scant grey hairs even on the ground
2948,ACT THE SECOND,"Which soon must be his grave; and my Maria,"
2949,ACT THE SECOND,"Her husband proved a monster, and her infants"
2950,ACT THE SECOND,"His infants--poor Maria!--all would perish,                        175"
2951,ACT THE SECOND,All perish--all!--and I (nay bear with me!)
2952,ACT THE SECOND,Could not survive the complicated ruin!
2953,ACT THE SECOND,

2959,ACT THE SECOND,"On the blank canvas, and each little herb,"

2968,ACT THE SECOND,_Maurice._           Heard you not some steps?
2969,ACT THE SECOND,
2970,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert._ What if it were my brother coming onward!
2971,ACT THE SECOND,Not very wisely (but his creature teiz'd me)
2972,ACT THE SECOND,I sent a most mysterious message to him.                           190
2973,ACT THE SECOND,
2974,ACT THE SECOND,_Maurice._ Would he not know you?
2975,ACT THE SECOND,
2976,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert._                         I unfearingly
2977,ACT THE SECOND,"Trust this disguise. Besides, he thinks me dead;"
2978,ACT THE SECOND,"And what the mind believes impossible,"
2979,ACT THE SECOND,The bodily sense is slow to recognize.
2980,ACT THE SECOND,"Add too my youth, when last we saw each other;                     195"
2981,ACT THE SECOND,"Manhood has swell'd my chest, and taught my voice"
2982,ACT THE SECOND,A hoarser note.
2983,ACT THE SECOND,
2984,ACT THE SECOND,_Maurice._      Most true! And Alva's Duke
2985,ACT THE SECOND,Did not improve it by the unwholesome viands
2986,ACT THE SECOND,"He gave so scantily in that foul dungeon,"
2987,ACT THE SECOND,During our long imprisonment.
2988,ACT THE SECOND,
2989,ACT THE SECOND,_Enter OSORIO._

2991,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert._                     It is he!                            200
2992,ACT THE SECOND,
2993,ACT THE SECOND,"_Maurice._ Make yourself talk; you'll feel the less. Come, speak."
2994,ACT THE SECOND,"How do you find yourself? Speak to me, Albert."
2995,ACT THE SECOND,
2996,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert (placing his hand on his heart)._ A little fluttering
2997,ACT THE SECOND,here; but more of sorrow!
2998,ACT THE SECOND,
2999,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio._ You know my name, perhaps, better than me."
3000,ACT THE SECOND,"I am Osorio, son of the Lord Velez.                                205"
3001,ACT THE SECOND,

3010,ACT THE SECOND,
3011,ACT THE SECOND,"_Maurice._ How your hand trembles, Albert! Speak! what wish you?"
3012,ACT THE SECOND,
3013,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert._ To fall upon his neck and weep in anguish!
3014,ACT THE SECOND,
3015,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio (returning)._ All very curious! from a ruin'd abbey
3016,ACT THE SECOND,Pluck'd in the moonlight. There's a strange power in weeds         210
3017,ACT THE SECOND,When a few odd prayers have been mutter'd o'er them.
3018,ACT THE SECOND,"Then they work miracles! I warrant you,"
3019,ACT THE SECOND,"There's not a leaf, but underneath it lurks"
3020,ACT THE SECOND,"Some serviceable imp. There's one of you,"
3021,ACT THE SECOND,Who sent me a strange message.
3022,ACT THE SECOND,
3023,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert._                      I am he!                            215
3024,ACT THE SECOND,
3025,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio._ I will speak with you, and by yourself."
3026,ACT THE SECOND,

3029,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._ 'He that can bring the dead to life again.'
3030,ACT THE SECOND,"Such was your message, Sir! You are no dullard,"
3031,ACT THE SECOND,But one that strips the outward rind of things!
3032,ACT THE SECOND,
3033,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert._ 'Tis fabled there are fruits with tempting rinds         220
3034,ACT THE SECOND,That are all dust and rottenness within.
3035,ACT THE SECOND,Would'st thou I should strip such?
3036,ACT THE SECOND,
3037,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio._                          Thou quibbling fool,"
3038,ACT THE SECOND,What dost thou mean? Think'st thou I journey'd hither
3039,ACT THE SECOND,To sport with thee?
3040,ACT THE SECOND,
3041,ACT THE SECOND,"_Albert._           No, no! my lord! to sport"
3042,ACT THE SECOND,Best fits the gaiety of innocence!                                 225
3043,ACT THE SECOND,
3044,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio (draws back as if stung and embarrassed, then folding his"

3046,ACT THE SECOND,"A fool--a fool, that laughs at its own folly,"
3047,ACT THE SECOND,Yet still a fool!                   [_Looks round the cottage._
3048,ACT THE SECOND,It strikes me you are poor!
3049,ACT THE SECOND,
3050,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert._ What follows thence?
3051,ACT THE SECOND,
3052,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._                      That you would fain be richer.
3053,ACT THE SECOND,"Besides, you do not love the rack, perhaps,                        230"
3054,ACT THE SECOND,"Nor a black dungeon, nor a fire of faggots."
3055,ACT THE SECOND,"The Inquisition--hey? You understand me,"
3056,ACT THE SECOND,"And you are poor. Now I have wealth and power,"
3057,ACT THE SECOND,"Can quench the flames, and cure your poverty."
3058,ACT THE SECOND,"And for this service, all I ask you is                             235"
3059,ACT THE SECOND,That you should serve me--once--for a few hours.
3060,ACT THE SECOND,
3061,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert (solemnly)._ Thou art the son of Velez! Would to Heaven
3062,ACT THE SECOND,That I could truly and for ever serve thee!
3063,ACT THE SECOND,
3064,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio._ The canting scoundrel softens.              [_Aside._
3065,ACT THE SECOND,You are my friend!
3066,ACT THE SECOND,'He that can bring the dead to life again.'                        240
3067,ACT THE SECOND,"Nay, no defence to me. The holy brethren"
3068,ACT THE SECOND,Believe these calumnies. I know thee better.
3069,ACT THE SECOND,
3070,ACT THE SECOND,[_Then with great bitterness._

3072,ACT THE SECOND,"Thou art a man, and as a man I'll trust thee!"
3073,ACT THE SECOND,
3074,ACT THE SECOND,"_Albert._ Alas, this hollow mirth! Declare your business!"
3075,ACT THE SECOND,
3076,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio._ I love a lady, and she would love me                     245"
3077,ACT THE SECOND,But for an idle and fantastic scruple.
3078,ACT THE SECOND,Have you no servants round the house? no listeners?
3079,ACT THE SECOND,
3080,ACT THE SECOND,[_OSORIO steps to the door._
3081,ACT THE SECOND,

3083,ACT THE SECOND,"To such a wife? Well might'st thou look so wan,"
3084,ACT THE SECOND,Ill-starr'd Maria! Wretch! my softer soul                          250
3085,ACT THE SECOND,Is pass'd away! and I will probe his conscience.
3086,ACT THE SECOND,
3087,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio (returned)._ In truth this lady loved another man,"
3088,ACT THE SECOND,But he has perish'd.
3089,ACT THE SECOND,

3091,ACT THE SECOND,
3092,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio._ I'll dash thee to the earth, if thou but think'st it,"

3094,ACT THE SECOND,I leave thee to the hangman!

3108,ACT THE SECOND,"At a round sum. Come, come, I spake unwisely."
3109,ACT THE SECOND,
3110,ACT THE SECOND,_Albert._ I listen to you.

3116,ACT THE SECOND,"_Albert._      Nay, speak out, 'twill ease your heart"

3118,ACT THE SECOND,Men think it natural to hate their rivals!
3119,ACT THE SECOND,
3120,ACT THE SECOND,_Osorio (hesitating and half doubting whether he should proceed)._

3129,ACT THE SECOND,"Dost pray to Lucifer, prince of the air?"
3130,ACT THE SECOND,

3136,ACT THE SECOND,"Politic wizard! ere you sent that message,"
3137,ACT THE SECOND,"You had conn'd your lesson, made yourself proficient"

3139,ACT THE SECOND,"A golden crop!--well, you have not mistaken--"
3140,ACT THE SECOND,"Be faithful to me, and I'll pay thee nobly."

3143,ACT THE SECOND,
3144,ACT THE SECOND,"_Osorio._ If we could make her certain of his death,"

3160,ACT THE SECOND,[_A pause._
3161,ACT THE SECOND,

3165,ACT THE SECOND,He is in heaven then!--there you have no influence--
3166,ACT THE SECOND,Still there are tokens; and your imps may bring you
3167,ACT THE SECOND,Something he wore about him when he died.
3168,ACT THE SECOND,And when the smoke of the incense on the altar

4702,ACT THE FOURTH,_Ferdinand._                    No!--the fool.
4703,ACT THE FOURTH,He had not wit enough to be a traitor.
4704,ACT THE FOURTH,Poor thick-eyed beetle! not to have foreseen                       135
4705,ACT THE FOURTH,"That he, who gull'd thee with a whimper'd lie"
4706,ACT THE FOURTH,"To murder _his own brother_, would not scruple"
4707,ACT THE FOURTH,"To murder _thee_, if e'er his guilt grew jealous"
4708,ACT THE FOURTH,And he could steal upon thee in the dark!
4709,ACT THE FOURTH,
4710,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Osorio._ Thou would'st not then have come, if----"
4711,ACT THE FOURTH,
4712,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Ferdinand._                                     O yes, my lord!   140"

4718,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Osorio._ Now this is excellent, and warms the blood!"
4719,ACT THE FOURTH,"My heart was drawing back, drawing me back"
4720,ACT THE FOURTH,"With womanish pulls of pity. Dusky slave,"
4721,ACT THE FOURTH,"Now I will kill thee pleasantly, and count it                      145"
4722,ACT THE FOURTH,Among my comfortable thoughts hereafter.

4731,ACT THE FOURTH,thee!
4732,ACT THE FOURTH,
4733,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Osorio._ Nay, fool! stand off."
4734,ACT THE FOURTH,I'll kill thee--but not so! Go fetch thy sword.

4747,ACT THE FOURTH,
4748,ACT THE FOURTH,_MARIA and her FOSTER-MOTHER._
4749,ACT THE FOURTH,
4750,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Maria._ And when I heard that you desired to see me,"
4751,ACT THE FOURTH,I thought your business was to tell me of him.
4752,ACT THE FOURTH,
4753,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Foster-Mother._ I never saw the Moor, whom you describe."
4754,ACT THE FOURTH,
4755,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._ 'Tis strange! he spake of you familiarly                  155
4756,ACT THE FOURTH,As mine and Albert's common foster-mother.
4757,ACT THE FOURTH,
4758,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Foster-Mother._ Now blessings on the man, whoe'er he be,"
4759,ACT THE FOURTH,"That join'd your names with mine! O my sweet lady,"
4760,ACT THE FOURTH,As often as I think of those dear times
4761,ACT THE FOURTH,"When you two little ones would stand at eve,                       160"
4762,ACT THE FOURTH,"On each side of my chair, and make me learn"
4763,ACT THE FOURTH,All you had learnt in the day; and how to talk
4764,ACT THE FOURTH,"In gentle phrase, then bid me sing to you,"
4765,ACT THE FOURTH,"'Tis more like heaven to come, that what _has_ been!"
4766,ACT THE FOURTH,
4767,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._ O my dear mother! this strange man has left me            165
4768,ACT THE FOURTH,Wilder'd with wilder fancies than yon moon
4769,ACT THE FOURTH,Breeds in the love-sick maid--who gazes at it
4770,ACT THE FOURTH,"Till lost in inward vision, with wet eye"
4771,ACT THE FOURTH,"She gazes idly! But that entrance, mother!"
4772,ACT THE FOURTH,
4773,ACT THE FOURTH,_Foster-Mother._ Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale!           170
4774,ACT THE FOURTH,
4775,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._ No one.
4776,ACT THE FOURTH,
4777,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Foster-Mother._ My husband's father told it me,"
4778,ACT THE FOURTH,Poor old Leoni. Angels rest his soul!
4779,ACT THE FOURTH,"He was a woodman, and could fell and saw"
4780,ACT THE FOURTH,With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam
4781,ACT THE FOURTH,Which props the hanging wall of the old chapel?                    175
4782,ACT THE FOURTH,"Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree,"
4783,ACT THE FOURTH,"He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined"
4784,ACT THE FOURTH,"With thistle-beards, and such small locks of wool"
4785,ACT THE FOURTH,"As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home,"
4786,ACT THE FOURTH,And rear'd him at the then Lord Velez' cost.                       180
4787,ACT THE FOURTH,And so the babe grew up a pretty boy.
4788,ACT THE FOURTH,"A pretty boy, but most unteachable--"
4789,ACT THE FOURTH,"And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead,"
4790,ACT THE FOURTH,"But knew the names of birds, and mock'd their notes,"
4791,ACT THE FOURTH,"And whistled, as he were a bird himself.                           185"
4792,ACT THE FOURTH,And all the autumn 'twas his only play
4793,ACT THE FOURTH,"To get the seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them"
4794,ACT THE FOURTH,With earth and water on the stumps of trees.
4795,ACT THE FOURTH,"A friar who gather'd simples in the wood,"
4796,ACT THE FOURTH,"A grey-hair'd man--he loved this little boy,                       190"
4797,ACT THE FOURTH,"The boy loved him--and, when the friar taught him,"
4798,ACT THE FOURTH,He soon could write with the pen; and from that time
4799,ACT THE FOURTH,Lived chiefly at the convent or the castle.
4800,ACT THE FOURTH,So he became a very learned youth.
4801,ACT THE FOURTH,"But O! poor wretch--he read, and read, and read,                   195"
4802,ACT THE FOURTH,"Till his brain turn'd--and ere his twentieth year,"
4803,ACT THE FOURTH,He had unlawful thoughts of many things.
4804,ACT THE FOURTH,"And though he pray'd, he never loved to pray"
4805,ACT THE FOURTH,"With holy men, nor in a holy place."
4806,ACT THE FOURTH,"But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet,                      200"
4807,ACT THE FOURTH,"The late Lord Velez ne'er was wearied with him,"
4808,ACT THE FOURTH,And once as by the north side of the chapel
4809,ACT THE FOURTH,"They stood together, chain'd in deep discourse,"
4810,ACT THE FOURTH,"The earth heav'd under them with such a groan,"
4811,ACT THE FOURTH,"That the wall totter'd, and had well-nigh fall'n                   205"
4812,ACT THE FOURTH,Right on their heads. My lord was sorely frighten'd;
4813,ACT THE FOURTH,A fever seiz'd him; and he made confession
4814,ACT THE FOURTH,Of all the heretical and lawless talk
4815,ACT THE FOURTH,Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seiz'd
4816,ACT THE FOURTH,And cast into that hole. My husband's father                       210
4817,ACT THE FOURTH,Sobb'd like a child--it almost broke his heart.
4818,ACT THE FOURTH,"And once as he was working in the cellar,"
4819,ACT THE FOURTH,"He heard a voice distinctly; 'twas the youth's,"
4820,ACT THE FOURTH,"Who sung a doleful song about green fields,"
4821,ACT THE FOURTH,How sweet it were on lake or wild savannah                         215
4822,ACT THE FOURTH,"To hunt for food, and be a naked man,"
4823,ACT THE FOURTH,And wander up and down at liberty.
4824,ACT THE FOURTH,"He always doted on the youth, and now"
4825,ACT THE FOURTH,"His love grew desperate; and defying death,"
4826,ACT THE FOURTH,He made that cunning entrance I described:                         220
4827,ACT THE FOURTH,And the young man escaped.
4828,ACT THE FOURTH,
4829,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._                   'Tis a sweet tale:
4830,ACT THE FOURTH,"Such as would lull a list'ning child to sleep,"
4831,ACT THE FOURTH,His rosy face besoil'd with unwiped tears.
4832,ACT THE FOURTH,And what became of him?
4833,ACT THE FOURTH,
4834,ACT THE FOURTH,_Foster-Mother._        He went on shipboard
4835,ACT THE FOURTH,"With those bold voyagers, who made discovery                       225"
4836,ACT THE FOURTH,Of golden lands; Leoni's younger brother
4837,ACT THE FOURTH,"Went likewise, and when he return'd to Spain,"
4838,ACT THE FOURTH,"He told Leoni that the poor mad youth,"
4839,ACT THE FOURTH,"Soon after they arrived in that new world,"
4840,ACT THE FOURTH,"In spite of his dissuasion seized a boat,                          230"
4841,ACT THE FOURTH,"And all alone set sail by silent moonlight,"
4842,ACT THE FOURTH,"Up a great river, great as any sea,"
4843,ACT THE FOURTH,And ne'er was heard of more; but 'tis supposed
4844,ACT THE FOURTH,He liv'd and died among the savage men.
4845,ACT THE FOURTH,
4846,ACT THE FOURTH,_Enter VELEZ._
4847,ACT THE FOURTH,
4848,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Velez._ Still sad, Maria? This same wizard haunts you.            235"
4849,ACT THE FOURTH,
4850,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Maria._ O Christ! the tortures that hang o'er his head,"
4851,ACT THE FOURTH,If ye betray him to these holy brethren!
4852,ACT THE FOURTH,
4853,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Velez (with a kind of sneer)._ A portly man, and eloquent, and"
4854,ACT THE FOURTH,tender!
4855,ACT THE FOURTH,"In truth, I shall not wonder if you mourn"
4856,ACT THE FOURTH,That their rude grasp should seize on _such_ a victim.             240
4857,ACT THE FOURTH,
4858,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._ The horror of their ghastly punishments
4859,ACT THE FOURTH,"Doth so o'ertop the height of sympathy,"
4860,ACT THE FOURTH,That I should feel too little for mine enemy--
4861,ACT THE FOURTH,"Ah! far too little--if 'twere possible,"
4862,ACT THE FOURTH,"I could feel more, even tho' my child or husband                   245"
4863,ACT THE FOURTH,Were doom'd to suffer them! That such things are----
4864,ACT THE FOURTH,
4865,ACT THE FOURTH,_Velez._ Hush! thoughtless woman!
4866,ACT THE FOURTH,
4867,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._                          Nay--it wakes within me
4868,ACT THE FOURTH,More than a woman's spirit.
4869,ACT THE FOURTH,
4870,ACT THE FOURTH,_Velez (angrily)._          No more of this--
4871,ACT THE FOURTH,I can endure no more.
4872,ACT THE FOURTH,
4873,ACT THE FOURTH,_Foster-Mother._      My honour'd master!
4874,ACT THE FOURTH,Lord Albert used to talk so.
4875,ACT THE FOURTH,
4876,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._                     Yes! my mother!                       250
4877,ACT THE FOURTH,"These are my Albert's lessons, and I con them"
4878,ACT THE FOURTH,"With more delight than, in my fondest hour,"
4879,ACT THE FOURTH,I bend me o'er his portrait.
4880,ACT THE FOURTH,
4881,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Velez (to the Foster-Mother)._ My good woman,"
4882,ACT THE FOURTH,You may retire.                      [_Exit the FOSTER-MOTHER._
4883,ACT THE FOURTH,
4884,ACT THE FOURTH,_Velez._        We have mourn'd for Albert.
4885,ACT THE FOURTH,Have I no living son?
4886,ACT THE FOURTH,
4887,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._              Speak not of him!                            255
4888,ACT THE FOURTH,"That low imposture--my heart sickens at it,"
4889,ACT THE FOURTH,"If it be madness, must I wed a madman?"
4890,ACT THE FOURTH,"And if not madness, there is mystery,"
4891,ACT THE FOURTH,And guilt doth lurk behind it!
4892,ACT THE FOURTH,
4893,ACT THE FOURTH,_Valdez._                      Is this well?
4894,ACT THE FOURTH,
4895,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._ Yes! it is truth. Saw you his countenance?                260
4896,ACT THE FOURTH,"How rage, remorse, and scorn, and stupid fear,"
4897,ACT THE FOURTH,Displac'd each other with swift interchanges?
4898,ACT THE FOURTH,"If this were all assumed, as you believe,"
4899,ACT THE FOURTH,He must needs be a most consummate actor;
4900,ACT THE FOURTH,"And hath so vast a power to deceive me,                            265"
4901,ACT THE FOURTH,I never could be safe. And why assume
4902,ACT THE FOURTH,The semblance of such execrable feelings?
4903,ACT THE FOURTH,
4904,ACT THE FOURTH,_Velez._ Ungrateful woman! I have tried to stifle
4905,ACT THE FOURTH,An old man's passion! Was it not enough
4906,ACT THE FOURTH,"That thou hast made my son a restless man,                         270"
4907,ACT THE FOURTH,"Banish'd his health and half-unhinged his reason,"
4908,ACT THE FOURTH,"But that thou wilt insult him with suspicion,"
4909,ACT THE FOURTH,And toil to blast his honour? I am old--
4910,ACT THE FOURTH,A comfortless old man! Thou shalt not stay
4911,ACT THE FOURTH,Beneath my roof!
4912,ACT THE FOURTH,
4913,ACT THE FOURTH,[_FRANCESCO enters and stands listening._
4914,ACT THE FOURTH,
4915,ACT THE FOURTH,_Velez._         Repent and marry him--                            275
4916,ACT THE FOURTH,Or to the convent.
4917,ACT THE FOURTH,
4918,ACT THE FOURTH,_Francesco (muttering)._ Good! good! very good!
4919,ACT THE FOURTH,
4920,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Maria._ Nay, grant me some small pittance of my fortune,"
4921,ACT THE FOURTH,"And I will live a solitary woman,"
4922,ACT THE FOURTH,Or my poor foster-mother and her grandsons
4923,ACT THE FOURTH,May be my household.
4924,ACT THE FOURTH,
4925,ACT THE FOURTH,_Francesco (advancing)._ I abhor a listener;                       280
4926,ACT THE FOURTH,"But you spoke so, I could not choose but hear you."
4927,ACT THE FOURTH,"I pray, my lord! will you embolden me"
4928,ACT THE FOURTH,To ask you why this lady doth prefer
4929,ACT THE FOURTH,"To live in lonely sort, without a friend"
4930,ACT THE FOURTH,Or fit companion?
4931,ACT THE FOURTH,
4932,ACT THE FOURTH,_Velez._          Bid her answer you.                              285
4933,ACT THE FOURTH,
4934,ACT THE FOURTH,_Maria._ Nature will be my friend and fit companion.
4935,ACT THE FOURTH,
4936,ACT THE FOURTH,[_Turns off from them._
4937,ACT THE FOURTH,
4938,ACT THE FOURTH,"O Albert! Albert! that they could return,"
4939,ACT THE FOURTH,"Those blessed days, that imitated heaven!"
4940,ACT THE FOURTH,When we two wont to walk at evening-tide;
4941,ACT THE FOURTH,When we saw nought but beauty; when we heard                       290
4942,ACT THE FOURTH,"The voice of that Almighty One, who lov'd us,"
4943,ACT THE FOURTH,"In every gale that breath'd, and wave that murmur'd!"
4944,ACT THE FOURTH,"O we have listen'd, even till high-wrought pleasure"
4945,ACT THE FOURTH,"Hath half-assumed the countenance of grief,"
4946,ACT THE FOURTH,And the deep sigh seem'd to heave up a weight                      295
4947,ACT THE FOURTH,"Of bliss, that press'd too heavy on the heart."
4948,ACT THE FOURTH,
4949,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Francesco._ But in the convent, lady, you would have"
4950,ACT THE FOURTH,Such aids as might preserve you from perdition.
4951,ACT THE FOURTH,There you might dwell.
4952,ACT THE FOURTH,
4953,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Maria._               With tame and credulous faith,"

4955,ACT THE FOURTH,"Leanness, disquietude, and secret pangs!"
4956,ACT THE FOURTH,O God! it is a horrid thing to know
4957,ACT THE FOURTH,"That each pale wretch, who sits and drops her beads"
4958,ACT THE FOURTH,"Had once a mind, which might have given her wings"
4959,ACT THE FOURTH,Such as the angels wear!

4963,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Velez._ I have not seen him, father, since he left you."
4964,ACT THE FOURTH,
4965,ACT THE FOURTH,_Francesco._ His lordship's generous nature hath deceiv'd him!
4966,ACT THE FOURTH,_That_ Ferdinand (or if not he his wife)
4967,ACT THE FOURTH,I have fresh evidence--are infidels.
4968,ACT THE FOURTH,We are not safe until they are rooted out.                         310

4973,ACT THE FOURTH,That still thou thirstest for thy brother's blood?
4974,ACT THE FOURTH,
4975,ACT THE FOURTH,_Velez (rapidly)._ Father! I have long suspected it--her brain--   315
4976,ACT THE FOURTH,"Heed it not, father!"
4977,ACT THE FOURTH,
4978,ACT THE FOURTH,_Francesco._ Nay--but I _must_ heed it.
4979,ACT THE FOURTH,

4983,ACT THE FOURTH,"But O! 'tis wearisome to mourn for evils,"
4984,ACT THE FOURTH,"Still mourn, and have no power to remedy!        [_Exit MARIA._"

5143,ACT THE FOURTH,O God! I heard a groan!--and follow'd it.
5144,ACT THE FOURTH,And yet another groan--which guided me
5145,ACT THE FOURTH,"Into a strange recess--and there was _light_,"
5146,ACT THE FOURTH,A _hideous_ light! his torch lay on the ground--                   405
5147,ACT THE FOURTH,Its flame burnt dimly o'er a chasm's brink.
5148,ACT THE FOURTH,"I spake--and while I spake, a feeble groan"

5150,ACT THE FOURTH,
5151,ACT THE FOURTH,"_Maurice._ Comfort her, comfort her, Almighty Father!"

5163,ACT THE FOURTH,My eyeballs burnt! my brain grew hot as fire!
5164,ACT THE FOURTH,And all the hanging drops of the wet roof
5165,ACT THE FOURTH,Turn'd into blood. I saw them turn to blood!
5166,ACT THE FOURTH,And I was leaping wildly down the chasm                            420
5167,ACT THE FOURTH,"When on the further brink I saw his sword,"
5168,ACT THE FOURTH,"And it said, Vengeance! Curses on my tongue!"

6834,FOOTNOTES:,This is a most grievous fault. (3) The assassins talk ludicrously. This
6835,FOOTNOTES:,is a most egregious misimitation of Shakespere--Schiller should not have
6836,FOOTNOTES:,"attempted tragico-comedy, and none but Shakespere has succeeded. It is"
6837,FOOTNOTES:,"wonderful, however, that Schiller, who had studied Shakespere, should"

6844,FOOTNOTES:,"than dramatic, and a more dramatic than a tragic character. Shakespere"
6845,FOOTNOTES:,"draws _strength_ as in Richard the Third, and even when he blends"
6846,FOOTNOTES:,weakness as in Macbeth--yet it is weakness of a specific kind that
6847,FOOTNOTES:,leaves the strength in full and fearful energy--but Schiller has drawn
6848,FOOTNOTES:,weakness imposing on itself the love of power for the sense of strength
6849,FOOTNOTES:,"(a fine conception in itself, but not tragic--at least for the principal"
6850,FOOTNOTES:,"character of a long drama).--Hence Wallenstein, with one exception (that"
6851,FOOTNOTES:,of the Regimental Deputation to him in the Second Part) evaporates in
6852,FOOTNOTES:,"mock-mysterious speeches. These are the chief defects, I think. On the"

6886,SCENE I,A Swedish caravan was on its way                                     5
6887,SCENE I,"Transporting a rich cargo of provision,"
6888,SCENE I,Almost six hundred waggons. This my Croats
6889,SCENE I,"Plunged down upon and seized, this weighty prize!----"
6890,SCENE I,We bring it hither----
6891,SCENE I,
6892,SCENE I,_Illo._                Just in time to banquet
6893,SCENE I,The illustrious company assembled here.                             10
6894,SCENE I,
6895,SCENE I,_Butler._ 'Tis all alive! a stirring scene here!
6896,SCENE I,
6897,SCENE I,_Isolani._                                       Ay!
6898,SCENE I,The very churches are all full of soldiers.
6899,SCENE I,"And in the Council-house, too, I observe,"
6900,SCENE I,"You're settled, quite at home! Well, well! we soldiers"
6901,SCENE I,Must shift and suit us in what way we can.                          15
6902,SCENE I,
6903,SCENE I,_Illo._ We have the Colonels here of thirty regiments.
6904,SCENE I,"You'll find Count Tertsky here, and Tiefenbach,"
6905,SCENE I,"Kolatto, Goetz, Maradas, Hinnersam,"
6906,SCENE I,"The Piccolomini, both son and father----"
6907,SCENE I,You'll meet with many an unexpected greeting                        20
6908,SCENE I,From many an old friend and acquaintance. Only
6909,SCENE I,"Galas is wanting still, and Altringer."
6910,SCENE I,
6911,SCENE I,_Butler._ Expect not Galas.
6912,SCENE I,
6913,SCENE I,_Illo._ How so? Do you know----
6914,SCENE I,
6915,SCENE I,_Isolani._ Max Piccolomini here?--O bring me to him.                25
6916,SCENE I,"I see him yet, ('tis now ten years ago,"
6917,SCENE I,We were engaged with Mansfeld hard by Dessau)
6918,SCENE I,"I see the youth, in my mind's eye I see him,"
6919,SCENE I,"Leap his black war-horse from the bridge adown,"
6920,SCENE I,"And t'ward his father, then in extreme peril,                       30"
6921,SCENE I,Beat up against the strong tide of the Elbe.
6922,SCENE I,The down was scarce upon his chin! I hear
6923,SCENE I,"He has made good the promise of his youth,"
6924,SCENE I,And the full hero now is finished in him.
6925,SCENE I,
6926,SCENE I,_Illo._ You'll see him yet ere evening. He conducts                 35
6927,SCENE I,"The Duchess Friedland hither, and the Princess[601:1]"
6928,SCENE I,From Carnthen. We expect them here at noon.
6929,SCENE I,
6930,SCENE I,_Butler._ Both wife and daughter does the Duke call hither?
6931,SCENE I,He crowds in visitants from all sides.
6932,SCENE I,
6933,SCENE I,_Isolani._                             Hm!
6934,SCENE I,So much the better! I had framed my mind                            40
6935,SCENE I,"To hear of nought but warlike circumstance,"
6936,SCENE I,"Of marches, and attacks, and batteries:"
6937,SCENE I,"And lo! the Duke provides, that something too"
6938,SCENE I,"Of gentler sort, and lovely, should be present"
6939,SCENE I,To feast our eyes.                                                  45
6940,SCENE I,
6941,SCENE I,_Illo (aside to Butler)._ And how came you to know
6942,SCENE I,That the Count Galas joins us not?
6943,SCENE I,
6944,SCENE I,_Butler._                          Because
6945,SCENE I,He importuned me to remain behind.
6946,SCENE I,
6947,SCENE I,_Illo._ And you?--You hold out firmly?
6948,SCENE I,Noble Butler!
6949,SCENE I,
6950,SCENE I,_Butler._ After the obligation which the Duke                       50
6951,SCENE I,Had laid so newly on me----
6952,SCENE I,
6953,SCENE I,_Illo._                     I had forgotten
6954,SCENE I,"A pleasant duty--Major-General,"
6955,SCENE I,I wish you joy!
6956,SCENE I,
6957,SCENE I,"_Isolani._ What, you mean, of his regiment?"
6958,SCENE I,"I hear, too, that to make the gift still sweeter,                   55"
6959,SCENE I,The Duke has given him the very same
6960,SCENE I,"In which he first saw service, and since then,"
6961,SCENE I,"Worked himself, step by step, through each preferment,"
6962,SCENE I,"From the ranks upwards. And verily, it gives"
6963,SCENE I,"A precedent of hope, a spur of action                               60"
6964,SCENE I,"To the whole corps, if once in their remembrance"
6965,SCENE I,An old deserving soldier makes his way.
6966,SCENE I,
6967,SCENE I,"_Butler._ I am perplexed and doubtful, whether or no"
6968,SCENE I,I dare accept this your congratulation.
6969,SCENE I,The Emperor has not yet confirmed the appointment.                  65
6970,SCENE I,
6971,SCENE I,"_Isolani._ Seize it, friend! Seize it! The hand which in that post"
6972,SCENE I,"Placed you, is strong enough to keep you there,"
6973,SCENE I,Spite of the Emperor and his Ministers!
6974,SCENE I,
6975,SCENE I,"_Illo._ Ay, if we would but so consider it!--"
6976,SCENE I,If we would all of us consider it so!                               70
6977,SCENE I,The Emperor gives us nothing; from the Duke
6978,SCENE I,"Comes all--whate'er we hope, whate'er we have."
6979,SCENE I,
6980,SCENE I,_Isolani (to Illo)._ My noble brother! did I tell you how
6981,SCENE I,The Duke will satisfy my creditors?
6982,SCENE I,"Will be himself my banker for the future,                           75"
6983,SCENE I,Make me once more a creditable man!--
6984,SCENE I,"And this is now the third time, think of that!"
6985,SCENE I,This kingly-minded man has rescued me
6986,SCENE I,"From absolute ruin, and restored my honour."
6987,SCENE I,
6988,SCENE I,_Illo._ O that his power but kept pace with his wishes!             80
6989,SCENE I,"Why, friend! he'd give the whole world to his soldiers."
6990,SCENE I,"But at Vienna, brother! here's the grievance!--"
6991,SCENE I,What politic schemes do they not lay to shorten
6992,SCENE I,"His arm, and, where they can, to clip his pinions."
6993,SCENE I,"Then these new dainty requisitions! these,                          85"
6994,SCENE I,Which this same Questenberg brings hither!--
6995,SCENE I,
6996,SCENE I,"_Butler._                                    Ay,"
6997,SCENE I,"These requisitions of the Emperor,--"
6998,SCENE I,I too have heard about them; but I hope
6999,SCENE I,The Duke will not draw back a single inch!                          90
7000,SCENE I,
7001,SCENE I,"_Illo._ Not from his right most surely, unless first"
7002,SCENE I,--From office!
7003,SCENE I,
7004,SCENE I,_Butler._      Know you aught then? You alarm me.
7005,SCENE I,
7006,SCENE I,"_Isolani (at the same time with Butler, and in a hurrying voice)._"
7007,SCENE I,"We should be ruined, every one of us!"
7008,SCENE I,
7009,SCENE I,_Illo._                                   No more!
7010,SCENE I,Yonder I see our worthy friend[603:1] approaching
7011,SCENE I,"With the Lieutenant-General, Piccolomini."
7012,SCENE I,
7013,SCENE I,_Butler._ I fear we shall not go hence as we came.                  95

7101,SCENE II,"Acknowledge, friend! that never was a camp,"
7102,SCENE II,Which held at once so many heads of heroes.
7103,SCENE II,"Welcome, Count Isolani!"
7104,SCENE II,
7105,SCENE II,"_Isolani._              My noble brother,"
7106,SCENE II,Even now am I arrived; it had been else my duty--                    5
7107,SCENE II,
7108,SCENE II,"_Octavio._ And Colonel Butler--trust me, I rejoice"
7109,SCENE II,Thus to renew acquaintance with a man
7110,SCENE II,Whose worth and services I know and honour.
7111,SCENE II,"See, see, my friend!"
7112,SCENE II,There might we place at once before our eyes                        10
7113,SCENE II,The sum of war's whole trade and mystery--

7115,SCENE II,"[_To QUESTENBERG, presenting BUTLER and ISOLANI at the"

7117,SCENE II,
7118,SCENE II,These two the total sum--Strength and Dispatch.
7119,SCENE II,
7120,SCENE II,_Questenberg (to Octavio)._ And lo! betwixt them both experienced
7121,SCENE II,Prudence!
7122,SCENE II,
7123,SCENE II,_Octavio (presenting Questenberg to Butler and Isolani)._ The
7124,SCENE II,"Chamberlain and War-commissioner Questenberg,"
7125,SCENE II,"The bearer of the Emperor's behests,                                15"
7126,SCENE II,"The long-tried friend and patron of all soldiers,"
7127,SCENE II,We honour in this noble visitor.
7128,SCENE II,
7129,SCENE II,"_Illo._ 'Tis not the first time, noble Minister,"
7130,SCENE II,You have shewn our camp this honour.
7131,SCENE II,
7132,SCENE II,_Questenberg._                       Once before
7133,SCENE II,I stood before these colours.                                       20
7134,SCENE II,
7135,SCENE II,_Illo._ Perchance too you remember where that was.
7136,SCENE II,"It was at Zn√§im[604:1] in Moravia, where"
7137,SCENE II,You did present yourself upon the part
7138,SCENE II,"Of the Emperor, to supplicate our Duke"
7139,SCENE II,That he would straight assume the chief command.                    25
7140,SCENE II,
7141,SCENE II,"_Questenberg._ To supplicate? Nay, noble General!"
7142,SCENE II,So far extended neither my commission
7143,SCENE II,(At least to my own knowledge) nor my zeal.
7144,SCENE II,
7145,SCENE II,"_Illo._ Well, well, then--to compel him, if you choose."
7146,SCENE II,"I can remember me right well, Count Tilly                           30"
7147,SCENE II,Had suffered total rout upon the Lech.
7148,SCENE II,"Bavaria lay all open to the enemy,"
7149,SCENE II,Whom there was nothing to delay from pressing
7150,SCENE II,Onwards into the very heart of Austria.
7151,SCENE II,At that time you and Werdenberg appeared                            35
7152,SCENE II,"Before our General, storming him with prayers,"
7153,SCENE II,"And menacing the Emperor's displeasure,"
7154,SCENE II,Unless he took compassion on this wretchedness.
7155,SCENE II,
7156,SCENE II,"_Isolani._ Yes, yes, 'tis comprehensible enough,"
7157,SCENE II,Wherefore with your commission of to-day                            40
7158,SCENE II,You were not all too willing to remember
7159,SCENE II,Your former one.
7160,SCENE II,
7161,SCENE II,"_Questenberg._   Why not, Count Isolan?"
7162,SCENE II,No contradiction sure exists between them.
7163,SCENE II,It was the urgent business of that time                             45
7164,SCENE II,To snatch Bavaria from her enemy's hand;
7165,SCENE II,And my commission of to-day instructs me
7166,SCENE II,To free her from her good friends and protectors.
7167,SCENE II,
7168,SCENE II,_Illo._ A worthy office! After with our blood
7169,SCENE II,"We have wrested this Bohemia from the Saxon,                        50"
7170,SCENE II,"To be swept out of it is all our thanks,"
7171,SCENE II,The sole reward of all our hard-won victories.
7172,SCENE II,
7173,SCENE II,_Questenberg._ Unless that wretched land be doomed to suffer
7174,SCENE II,"Only a change of evils, it must be"
7175,SCENE II,Freed from the scourge alike of friend and foe.                     55
7176,SCENE II,
7177,SCENE II,_Illo._ What? 'Twas a favourable year; the Boors
7178,SCENE II,Can answer fresh demands already.
7179,SCENE II,
7180,SCENE II,"_Questenberg._                    Nay,"
7181,SCENE II,If you discourse of herds and meadow-grounds--
7182,SCENE II,
7183,SCENE II,"_Isolani._ The war maintains the war. Are the Boors ruined,"
7184,SCENE II,The Emperor gains so many more new soldiers.                        60
7185,SCENE II,
7186,SCENE II,_Questenberg._ And is the poorer by even so many subjects.
7187,SCENE II,
7188,SCENE II,_Isolani._ Poh! We are all his subjects.
7189,SCENE II,
7190,SCENE II,"_Questenberg._ Yet with a difference, General! The one fill"
7191,SCENE II,"With profitable industry the purse,"
7192,SCENE II,The others are well skilled to empty it.                            65
7193,SCENE II,The sword has made the Emperor poor; the plough
7194,SCENE II,Must reinvigorate his resources.
7195,SCENE II,
7196,SCENE II,_Isolani._                       Sure!
7197,SCENE II,Times are not yet so bad. Methinks I see
7198,SCENE II,
7199,SCENE II,[_Examining with his eye the dress and ornaments
7200,SCENE II,of QUESTENBERG._
7201,SCENE II,
7202,SCENE II,Good store of gold that still remains uncoined.
7203,SCENE II,
7204,SCENE II,_Questenberg._ Thank Heaven! that means have been found out to
7205,SCENE II,hide                                                            70

7208,SCENE II,"_Illo._ There! The Stawata and the Martinitz,"
7209,SCENE II,"On whom the Emperor heaps his gifts and graces,"
7210,SCENE II,To the heart-burning of all good Bohemians--
7211,SCENE II,"Those minions of court favour, those court harpies,                 75"
7212,SCENE II,Who fatten on the wrecks of citizens
7213,SCENE II,Driven from their house and home--who reap no harvests
7214,SCENE II,Save in the general calamity--
7215,SCENE II,"Who now, with kingly pomp, insult and mock"
7216,SCENE II,"The desolation of their country--these,                             80"
7217,SCENE II,"Let these, and such as these, support the war,"
7218,SCENE II,"The fatal war, which they alone enkindled!"
7219,SCENE II,
7220,SCENE II,"_Butler._ And those state-parasites, who have their feet"
7221,SCENE II,"So constantly beneath the Emperor's table,"
7222,SCENE II,"Who cannot let a benefice fall, but they                            85"
7223,SCENE II,"Snap at it with dog's hunger--they, forsooth,"
7224,SCENE II,"Would pare the soldier's bread, and cross his reckoning!"
7225,SCENE II,
7226,SCENE II,"_Isolani._ My life long will it anger me to think,"
7227,SCENE II,"How when I went to court seven years ago,"
7228,SCENE II,"To see about new horses for our regiment,                           90"
7229,SCENE II,How from one antechamber to another
7230,SCENE II,"They dragged me on, and left me by the hour"
7231,SCENE II,To kick my heels among a crowd of simpering
7232,SCENE II,"Feast-fattened slaves, as if I had come thither"
7233,SCENE II,A mendicant suitor for the crumbs of favour                         95
7234,SCENE II,"That fall beneath their tables. And, at last,"
7235,SCENE II,Whom should they send me but a Capuchin!
7236,SCENE II,Straight I began to muster up my sins
7237,SCENE II,For absolution--but no such luck for me!
7238,SCENE II,"This was the man, this Capuchin, with whom                         100"
7239,SCENE II,I was to treat concerning the army horses:
7240,SCENE II,"And I was forced at last to quit the field,"
7241,SCENE II,The business unaccomplished. Afterwards
7242,SCENE II,"The Duke procured me in three days, what I"
7243,SCENE II,Could not obtain in thirty at Vienna.                              105
7244,SCENE II,
7245,SCENE II,"_Questenberg._ Yes, yes! your travelling bills soon found their"
7246,SCENE II,way to us:
7247,SCENE II,Too well I know we have still accounts to settle.
7248,SCENE II,
7249,SCENE II,_Illo._ War is a violent trade; one cannot always
7250,SCENE II,Finish one's work by soft means; every trifle
7251,SCENE II,Must not be blackened into sacrilege.                              110
7252,SCENE II,"If we should wait till you, in solemn council,"
7253,SCENE II,With due deliberation had selected
7254,SCENE II,"The smallest out of four-and-twenty evils,"
7255,SCENE II,"I'faith, we should wait long.--"
7256,SCENE II,'Dash! and through with it!'--That's the better watch-word.        115
7257,SCENE II,Then after come what may come. 'Tis man's nature
7258,SCENE II,To make the best of a bad thing once past.
7259,SCENE II,A bitter and perplexed 'what shall I do?'
7260,SCENE II,Is worse to man than worst necessity.
7261,SCENE II,
7262,SCENE II,"_Questenberg._ Ay, doubtless, it is true: the Duke does spare us   120"
7263,SCENE II,The troublesome task of choosing.
7264,SCENE II,
7265,SCENE II,"_Butler._                         Yes, the Duke"
7266,SCENE II,Cares with a father's feelings for his troops;
7267,SCENE II,"But how the Emperor feels for us, we see."
7268,SCENE II,
7269,SCENE II,"_Questenberg._ His cares and feelings all ranks share alike,"
7270,SCENE II,Nor will he offer one up to another.                               125
7271,SCENE II,
7272,SCENE II,_Isolani._ And therefore thrusts he us into the deserts
7273,SCENE II,"As beasts of prey, that so he may preserve"
7274,SCENE II,His dear sheep fattening in his fields at home.
7275,SCENE II,
7276,SCENE II,"_Questenberg._ Count, this comparison you make, not I."
7277,SCENE II,
7278,SCENE II,"_Butler._ Why, were we all the Court supposes us,                  130"
7279,SCENE II,"'Twere dangerous, sure, to give us liberty."
7280,SCENE II,
7281,SCENE II,_Questenberg._ You have taken liberty--it was not given you.
7282,SCENE II,And therefore it becomes an urgent duty
7283,SCENE II,To rein it in with curbs.
7284,SCENE II,
7285,SCENE II,"_Octavio._                My noble friend,"
7286,SCENE II,This is no more than a remembrancing                               135
7287,SCENE II,"That you are now in camp, and among warriors."
7288,SCENE II,The soldier's boldness constitutes his freedom.
7289,SCENE II,"Could he act daringly, unless he dared"
7290,SCENE II,Talk even so? One runs into the other.
7291,SCENE II,"The boldness of this worthy officer,     [_pointing to BUTLER._    140"
7292,SCENE II,"Which now has but mistaken in its mark,"
7293,SCENE II,"Preserved, when nought but boldness could preserve it,"
7294,SCENE II,"To the Emperor his capital city, Prague,"
7295,SCENE II,In a most formidable mutiny
7296,SCENE II,Of the whole garrison.         [_Military music at a distance._    145
7297,SCENE II,Hah! here they come!
7298,SCENE II,
7299,SCENE II,_Illo._ The sentries are saluting them: this signal
7300,SCENE II,Announces the arrival of the Duchess.
7301,SCENE II,
7302,SCENE II,_Octavio._ Then my son Max too has returned. 'Twas he
7303,SCENE II,Fetched and attended them from Carnthen hither.                    150
7304,SCENE II,
7305,SCENE II,_Isolani (to Illo)._ Shall we not go in company to greet them?
7306,SCENE II,
7307,SCENE II,"_Illo._ Well, let us go.--Ho! Colonel Butler, come."
7308,SCENE II,
7309,SCENE II,[_To OCTAVIO._

7311,SCENE II,"You'll not forget, that yet ere noon we meet"

7377,SCENE III,_QUESTENBERG and OCTAVIO._
7378,SCENE III,
7379,SCENE III,"_Questenberg._ What have I not been forced to hear, Octavio!"
7380,SCENE III,"What sentiments! what fierce, uncurbed defiance!"
7381,SCENE III,And were this spirit universal--
7382,SCENE III,
7383,SCENE III,_Octavio._                       Hm!
7384,SCENE III,You are now acquainted with three-fourths of the army.
7385,SCENE III,
7386,SCENE III,_Questenberg._ Where must we seek then for a second host             5
7387,SCENE III,To have the custody of this? That Illo
7388,SCENE III,"Thinks worse, I fear me, than he speaks. And then"
7389,SCENE III,This Butler too--he cannot even conceal
7390,SCENE III,The passionate workings of his ill intentions.
7391,SCENE III,
7392,SCENE III,_Octavio._ Quickness of temper--irritated pride;                    10
7393,SCENE III,'Twas nothing more. I cannot give up Butler.
7394,SCENE III,I know a spell that will soon dispossess
7395,SCENE III,The evil spirit in him.
7396,SCENE III,
7397,SCENE III,"_Questenberg._          Friend, friend!"
7398,SCENE III,"O! this is worse, far worse, than we had suffered"
7399,SCENE III,Ourselves to dream of at Vienna. There                              15
7400,SCENE III,"We saw it only with a courtier's eyes,"
7401,SCENE III,Eyes dazzled by the splendour of the throne.
7402,SCENE III,"We had not seen the War-Chief, the Commander,"
7403,SCENE III,"The man all-powerful in his camp. Here, here,"
7404,SCENE III,'Tis quite another thing.                                           20
7405,SCENE III,Here is no Emperor more--the Duke is Emperor.
7406,SCENE III,"Alas, my friend! alas, my noble friend!"
7407,SCENE III,This walk which you have ta'en me through the camp
7408,SCENE III,Strikes my hopes prostrate.
7409,SCENE III,
7410,SCENE III,_Octavio._                  Now you see yourself
7411,SCENE III,"Of what a perilous kind the office is,                              25"
7412,SCENE III,Which you deliver to me from the Court.
7413,SCENE III,The least suspicion of the General
7414,SCENE III,"Costs me my freedom and my life, and would"
7415,SCENE III,But hasten his most desperate enterprise.
7416,SCENE III,
7417,SCENE III,_Questenberg._ Where was our reason sleeping when we trusted        30
7418,SCENE III,"This madman with the sword, and placed such power"
7419,SCENE III,"In such a hand? I tell you, he'll refuse,"
7420,SCENE III,"Flatly refuse, to obey the Imperial orders."
7421,SCENE III,"Friend, he can do 't, and what he can, he will."
7422,SCENE III,And then the impunity of his defiance--                             35
7423,SCENE III,O! what a proclamation of our weakness!
7424,SCENE III,
7425,SCENE III,"_Octavio._ D'ye think too, he has brought his wife and daughter"
7426,SCENE III,Without a purpose hither? Here in camp!
7427,SCENE III,"And at the very point of time, in which"
7428,SCENE III,We're arming for the war? That he has taken                         40
7429,SCENE III,"These, the last pledges of his loyalty,"
7430,SCENE III,Away from out the Emperor's domains--
7431,SCENE III,This is no doubtful token of the nearness
7432,SCENE III,Of some eruption!
7433,SCENE III,
7434,SCENE III,_Questenberg._    How shall we hold footing
7435,SCENE III,"Beneath this tempest, which collects itself                         45"
7436,SCENE III,And threats us from all quarters? The enemy
7437,SCENE III,"Of the empire on our borders, now already"
7438,SCENE III,"The master of the Danube, and still farther,"
7439,SCENE III,"And farther still, extending every hour!"
7440,SCENE III,In our interior the alarum-bells                                    50
7441,SCENE III,Of insurrection--peasantry in arms----
7442,SCENE III,"All orders discontented--and the army,"
7443,SCENE III,Just in the moment of our expectation
7444,SCENE III,Of aidance from it--lo! this very army
7445,SCENE III,"Seduced, run wild, lost to all discipline,                          55"
7446,SCENE III,"Loosened, and rent asunder from the state"
7447,SCENE III,"And from their sovereign, the blind instrument"
7448,SCENE III,"Of the most daring of mankind, a weapon"
7449,SCENE III,"Of fearful power, which at his will he wields!"
7450,SCENE III,
7451,SCENE III,"_Octavio._ Nay, nay, friend! let us not despair too soon,           60"
7452,SCENE III,Men's words are ever bolder than their deeds:
7453,SCENE III,"And many a resolute, who now appears"
7454,SCENE III,"Made up to all extremes, will, on a sudden"
7455,SCENE III,"Find in his breast a heart he knew not of,"
7456,SCENE III,Let but a single honest man speak out                               65
7457,SCENE III,"The true name of his crime! Remember, too,"
7458,SCENE III,We stand not yet so wholly unprotected.
7459,SCENE III,Counts Altringer and Galas have maintained
7460,SCENE III,"Their little army faithful to its duty,"
7461,SCENE III,And daily it becomes more numerous.                                 70
7462,SCENE III,"Nor can he take us by surprise: you know,"
7463,SCENE III,I hold him all-encompassed by my listeners.
7464,SCENE III,"Whate'er he does, is mine, even while 'tis doing--"
7465,SCENE III,"No step so small, but instantly I hear it;"
7466,SCENE III,"Yea, his own mouth discloses it."
7467,SCENE III,
7468,SCENE III,_Questenberg._                   'Tis quite                         75
7469,SCENE III,"Incomprehensible, that he detects not"
7470,SCENE III,The foe so near!
7471,SCENE III,
7472,SCENE III,"_Octavio._       Beware, you do not think,"
7473,SCENE III,"That I by lying arts, and complaisant"
7474,SCENE III,"Hypocrisy, have skulked into his graces:"
7475,SCENE III,Or with the sustenance of smooth professions                        80
7476,SCENE III,Nourish his all-confiding friendship! No--
7477,SCENE III,"Compelled alike by prudence, and that duty"
7478,SCENE III,"Which we all owe our country, and our sovereign,"
7479,SCENE III,"To hide my genuine feelings from him, yet"
7480,SCENE III,Ne'er have I duped him with base counterfeits!                      85
7481,SCENE III,
7482,SCENE III,_Questenberg._ It is the visible ordinance of heaven.
7483,SCENE III,
7484,SCENE III,_Octavio._ I know not what it is that so attracts
7485,SCENE III,And links him both to me and to my son.
7486,SCENE III,"Comrades and friends we always were--long habit,"
7487,SCENE III,"Adventurous deeds performed in company,                             90"
7488,SCENE III,And all those many and various incidents
7489,SCENE III,"Which store a soldier's memory with affections,"
7490,SCENE III,Had bound us long and early to each other--
7491,SCENE III,"Yet I can name the day, when all at once"
7492,SCENE III,"His heart rose on me, and his confidence                            95"
7493,SCENE III,Shot out in sudden growth. It was the morning
7494,SCENE III,Before the memorable fight at L√ºtzner.
7495,SCENE III,"Urged by an ugly dream, I sought him out,"
7496,SCENE III,To press him to accept another charger.
7497,SCENE III,"At distance from the tents, beneath a tree,                        100"
7498,SCENE III,"I found him in a sleep. When I had waked him,"
7499,SCENE III,"And had related all my bodings to him,"
7500,SCENE III,"Long time he stared upon me, like a man"
7501,SCENE III,"Astounded; thereon fell upon my neck,"
7502,SCENE III,And manifested to me an emotion                                    105
7503,SCENE III,That far outstripped the worth of that small service.
7504,SCENE III,Since then his confidence has followed me
7505,SCENE III,With the same pace that mine has fled from him.
7506,SCENE III,
7507,SCENE III,_Questenberg._ You lead your son into the secret?
7508,SCENE III,
7509,SCENE III,_Octavio._                                        No!
7510,SCENE III,
7511,SCENE III,_Questenberg._ What? and not warn him either what bad hands        110
7512,SCENE III,His lot has placed him in?
7513,SCENE III,
7514,SCENE III,_Octavio._                 I must perforce
7515,SCENE III,Leave him in wardship to his innocence.
7516,SCENE III,His young and open soul--dissimulation
7517,SCENE III,Is foreign to its habits! Ignorance
7518,SCENE III,"Alone can keep alive the cheerful air,                             115"
7519,SCENE III,"The unembarrassed sense and light free spirit,"
7520,SCENE III,That make the Duke secure.
7521,SCENE III,
7522,SCENE III,_Questenberg._ My honoured friend! most highly do I deem
7523,SCENE III,Of Colonel Piccolomini--yet--if----
7524,SCENE III,Reflect a little----
7525,SCENE III,
7526,SCENE III,_Octavio._           I must venture it.                            120
7527,SCENE III,Hush!--There he comes!

8722,SCENE XII,The Emperor to his courageous armies
8723,SCENE XII,Presented in the person of Duke Friedland
8724,SCENE XII,"A most experienced and renowned commander,                          15"
8725,SCENE XII,He did it in glad hope and confidence
8726,SCENE XII,To give thereby to the fortune of the war
8727,SCENE XII,A rapid and auspicious change. The onset
8728,SCENE XII,Was favourable to his royal wishes.
8729,SCENE XII,"Bohemia was delivered from the Saxons,                              20"

8731,SCENE XII,"Began to draw breath freely, as Duke Friedland"
8732,SCENE XII,From all the streams of Germany forced hither
8733,SCENE XII,"The scattered armies of the enemy,"
8734,SCENE XII,Hither invoked as round one magic circle                            25

8736,SCENE XII,"Yea, and that never-conquered King himself;"
8737,SCENE XII,"Here finally, before the eye of N√ºrnberg,"
8738,SCENE XII,The fearful game of battle to decide.

8741,SCENE XII,
8742,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._ In N√ºrnberg's camp the Swedish monarch left
8743,SCENE XII,His fame--in L√ºtzen's plains his life. But who
8744,SCENE XII,"Stood not astounded, when victorious Friedland"
8745,SCENE XII,"After this day of triumph, this proud day,"
8746,SCENE XII,"Marched toward Bohemia with the speed of flight,                    35"
8747,SCENE XII,And vanished from the theatre of war;
8748,SCENE XII,While the young Weimar hero forced his way
8749,SCENE XII,"Into Franconia, to the Danube, like"
8750,SCENE XII,"Some delving winter-stream, which, where it rushes,"
8751,SCENE XII,Makes its own channel; with such sudden speed                       40
8752,SCENE XII,"He marched, and now at once 'fore Regenspurg"
8753,SCENE XII,Stood to the affright of all good Catholic Christians.
8754,SCENE XII,Then did Bavaria's well-deserving Prince
8755,SCENE XII,Entreat swift aidance in his extreme need;
8756,SCENE XII,"The Emperor sends seven horsemen to Duke Friedland,                 45"
8757,SCENE XII,Seven horsemen couriers sends he with the entreaty:
8758,SCENE XII,"He superadds his own, and supplicates"
8759,SCENE XII,Where as the sovereign lord he can command.
8760,SCENE XII,In vain his supplication! At this moment
8761,SCENE XII,"The Duke hears only his old hate and grudge,                        50"
8762,SCENE XII,Barters the general good to gratify
8763,SCENE XII,Private revenge--and so falls Regenspurg.
8764,SCENE XII,
8765,SCENE XII,"_Wallenstein._ Max, to what period of the war alludes he?"
8766,SCENE XII,My recollection fails me here.
8767,SCENE XII,
8768,SCENE XII,_Max._                         He means
8769,SCENE XII,When we were in Silesia.
8770,SCENE XII,
8771,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._           Ay! Is it so!                              55
8772,SCENE XII,But what had we to do there?
8773,SCENE XII,
8774,SCENE XII,_Max._                       To beat out
8775,SCENE XII,The Swedes and Saxons from the province.
8776,SCENE XII,
8777,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._                           True.
8778,SCENE XII,In that description which the Minister gave
8779,SCENE XII,I seemed to have forgotten the whole war.    [_To QUESTENBERG._
8780,SCENE XII,"Well, but proceed a little."
8781,SCENE XII,
8782,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._              Yes! at length                          60
8783,SCENE XII,Beside the river Oder did the Duke
8784,SCENE XII,Assert his ancient fame. Upon the fields
8785,SCENE XII,"Of Steinau did the Swedes lay down their arms,"
8786,SCENE XII,"Subdued without a blow. And here, with others,"
8787,SCENE XII,The righteousness of Heaven to his avenger                          65
8788,SCENE XII,Delivered that long-practised stirrer-up
8789,SCENE XII,"Of insurrection, that curse-laden torch"
8790,SCENE XII,"And kindler of this war, Matthias Thur."
8791,SCENE XII,But he had fallen into magnanimous hands;
8792,SCENE XII,"Instead of punishment he found reward,                              70"
8793,SCENE XII,And with rich presents did the Duke dismiss
8794,SCENE XII,The arch-foe of his Emperor.
8795,SCENE XII,
8796,SCENE XII,"_Wallenstein (laughs)._      I know,"
8797,SCENE XII,I know you had already in Vienna
8798,SCENE XII,Your windows and balconies all forestalled
8799,SCENE XII,To see him on the executioner's cart.                               75
8800,SCENE XII,"I might have lost the battle, lost it too"
8801,SCENE XII,"With infamy, and still retained your graces--"
8802,SCENE XII,"But, to have cheated them of a spectacle,"
8803,SCENE XII,"Oh! that the good folks of Vienna never,"
8804,SCENE XII,"No, never can forgive me."
8805,SCENE XII,
8806,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._            So Silesia                                80
8807,SCENE XII,"Was freed, and all things loudly called the Duke"
8808,SCENE XII,"Into Bavaria, now pressed hard on all sides."
8809,SCENE XII,"And he did put his troops in motion: slowly,"
8810,SCENE XII,"Quite at his ease, and by the longest road"
8811,SCENE XII,He traverses Bohemia; but ere ever                                  85
8812,SCENE XII,"He hath once seen the enemy, faces round,"
8813,SCENE XII,"Breaks up the march, and takes to winter quarters."
8814,SCENE XII,
8815,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._ The troops were pitiably destitute
8816,SCENE XII,"Of every necessary, every comfort."
8817,SCENE XII,The winter came. What thinks his Majesty                            90
8818,SCENE XII,His troops are made of? Arn't we men? subjected
8819,SCENE XII,"Like other men to wet, and cold, and all"
8820,SCENE XII,The circumstances of necessity?
8821,SCENE XII,O miserable lot of the poor soldier!
8822,SCENE XII,"Wherever he comes in, all flee before him,                          95"
8823,SCENE XII,"And when he goes away, the general curse"
8824,SCENE XII,"Follows him on his route. All must be seized,"
8825,SCENE XII,Nothing is given him. And compelled to seize
8826,SCENE XII,"From every man, he's every man's abhorrence."
8827,SCENE XII,"Behold, here stand my Generals. Karaffa!                           100"
8828,SCENE XII,Count Deodate! Butler! Tell this man
8829,SCENE XII,How long the soldiers' pay is in arrears.
8830,SCENE XII,
8831,SCENE XII,_Butler._ Already a full year.
8832,SCENE XII,
8833,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._                 And 'tis the hire
8834,SCENE XII,"That constitutes the hireling's name and duties,"
8835,SCENE XII,The soldier's pay is the soldier's covenant.[634:1]                105
8836,SCENE XII,
8837,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._ Ah! this is a far other tone from that
8838,SCENE XII,"In which the Duke spoke eight, nine years ago."
8839,SCENE XII,
8840,SCENE XII,"_Wallenstein._ Yes! 'tis my fault, I know it: I myself"
8841,SCENE XII,Have spoilt the Emperor by indulging him.
8842,SCENE XII,"Nine years ago, during the Danish war,                             110"
8843,SCENE XII,"I raised him up a force, a mighty force,"
8844,SCENE XII,"Forty or fifty thousand men, that cost him"
8845,SCENE XII,Of his own purse no doit. Through Saxony
8846,SCENE XII,"The fury goddess of the war marched on,"
8847,SCENE XII,"E'en to the surf-rocks of the Baltic, bearing                      115"
8848,SCENE XII,The terrors of his name. That was a time!
8849,SCENE XII,In the whole Imperial realm no name like mine
8850,SCENE XII,Honoured with festival and celebration--
8851,SCENE XII,"And Albrecht Wallenstein, it was the title"
8852,SCENE XII,Of the third jewel in his crown!                                   120
8853,SCENE XII,"But at the Diet, when the Princes met"
8854,SCENE XII,"At Regenspurg, there, there the whole broke out,"
8855,SCENE XII,"There 'twas laid open, there it was made known,"
8856,SCENE XII,Out of what money-bag I had paid the host.
8857,SCENE XII,"And what was now my thank, what had I now,                         125"
8858,SCENE XII,"That I, a faithful servant of the Sovereign,"
8859,SCENE XII,"Had loaded on myself the people's curses,"
8860,SCENE XII,And let the Princes of the empire pay
8861,SCENE XII,"The expenses of this war, that aggrandizes"
8862,SCENE XII,The Emperor alone--What thanks had I!                              130
8863,SCENE XII,"What? I was offered up to their complaints,"
8864,SCENE XII,"Dismissed, degraded!"
8865,SCENE XII,
8866,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._       But your Highness knows
8867,SCENE XII,What little freedom he possessed of action
8868,SCENE XII,In that disastrous diet.
8869,SCENE XII,
8870,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._           Death and hell!
8871,SCENE XII,I had that which could have procured him freedom.                  135
8872,SCENE XII,No! Since 'twas proved so inauspicious to me
8873,SCENE XII,"To serve the Emperor at the empire's cost,"
8874,SCENE XII,I have been taught far other trains of thinking
8875,SCENE XII,"Of the empire, and the diet of the empire."
8876,SCENE XII,"From the Emperor, doubtless, I received this staff,                140"
8877,SCENE XII,But now I hold it as the empire's general--
8878,SCENE XII,"For the common weal, the universal interest,"
8879,SCENE XII,And no more for that one man's aggrandizement!
8880,SCENE XII,But to the point. What is it that's desired of me?
8881,SCENE XII,
8882,SCENE XII,"_Questenberg._ First, his imperial Majesty hath willed             145"
8883,SCENE XII,That without pretexts of delay the army
8884,SCENE XII,Evacuate Bohemia.
8885,SCENE XII,
8886,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._    In this season?
8887,SCENE XII,And to what quarter wills the Emperor
8888,SCENE XII,That we direct our course?
8889,SCENE XII,
8890,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._             To the enemy.
8891,SCENE XII,"His Majesty resolves, that Regenspurg                              150"
8892,SCENE XII,"Be purified from the enemy, ere Easter,"
8893,SCENE XII,That Lutheranism may be no longer preached
8894,SCENE XII,"In that cathedral, nor heretical"
8895,SCENE XII,Defilement desecrate the celebration
8896,SCENE XII,Of that pure festival.
8897,SCENE XII,
8898,SCENE XII,"_Wallenstein._         My generals,                                155"
8899,SCENE XII,Can this be realized?
8900,SCENE XII,
8901,SCENE XII,_Illo._               'Tis not possible.
8902,SCENE XII,
8903,SCENE XII,_Butler._ It can't be realized.
8904,SCENE XII,
8905,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._                  The Emperor
8906,SCENE XII,Already hath commanded Colonel Suys
8907,SCENE XII,To advance toward Bavaria!
8908,SCENE XII,
8909,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._             What did Suys?
8910,SCENE XII,
8911,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._ That which his duty prompted. He advanced!          160
8912,SCENE XII,
8913,SCENE XII,"_Wallenstein._ What? he advanced? And I, his general,"
8914,SCENE XII,"Had given him orders, peremptory orders,"
8915,SCENE XII,Not to desert his station! Stands it thus
8916,SCENE XII,With my authority? Is this the obedience
8917,SCENE XII,"Due to my office, which being thrown aside                         165"
8918,SCENE XII,"No war can be conducted? Chieftains, speak!"
8919,SCENE XII,"You be the judges, generals! What deserves"
8920,SCENE XII,"That officer, who of his oath neglectful"
8921,SCENE XII,Is guilty of contempt of orders?
8922,SCENE XII,
8923,SCENE XII,_Illo._                          Death.
8924,SCENE XII,
8925,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._ Count Piccolomini! what has he deserved?            170
8926,SCENE XII,
8927,SCENE XII,"_Max Piccolomini._ According to the letter of the law,"
8928,SCENE XII,Death.
8929,SCENE XII,
8930,SCENE XII,_Isolani._ Death.
8931,SCENE XII,
8932,SCENE XII,"_Butler._         Death, by the laws of war."
8933,SCENE XII,
8934,SCENE XII,"[_QUESTENBERG rises from his seat, WALLENSTEIN follows;"
8935,SCENE XII,all the rest rise._
8936,SCENE XII,
8937,SCENE XII,"_Wallenstein._ To this the law condemns him, and not I."
8938,SCENE XII,"And if I shew him favour, 'twill arise"
8939,SCENE XII,From the reverence that I owe my Emperor.                          175
8940,SCENE XII,
8941,SCENE XII,"_Questenberg._ If so, I can say nothing further--here!"
8942,SCENE XII,
8943,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._ I accepted the command but on conditions!
8944,SCENE XII,"And this the first, that to the diminution"
8945,SCENE XII,"Of my authority no human being,"
8946,SCENE XII,"Not even the Emperor's self, should be entitled                    180"
8947,SCENE XII,"To do aught, or to say aught, with the army."
8948,SCENE XII,"If I stand warranter of the event,"
8949,SCENE XII,"Placing my honour and my head in pledge,"
8950,SCENE XII,Needs must I have full mastery in all
8951,SCENE XII,The means thereto. What rendered this Gustavus                     185
8952,SCENE XII,"Resistless, and unconquered upon earth?"
8953,SCENE XII,This--that he was the monarch in his army!
8954,SCENE XII,"A monarch, one who is indeed a monarch,"
8955,SCENE XII,Was never yet subdued but by his equal.
8956,SCENE XII,But to the point! The best is yet to come.                         190
8957,SCENE XII,"Attend now, generals!"
8958,SCENE XII,
8959,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._        The prince Cardinal
8960,SCENE XII,Begins his route at the approach of spring
8961,SCENE XII,From the Milanese; and leads a Spanish army
8962,SCENE XII,Through Germany into the Netherlands.
8963,SCENE XII,"That he may march secure and unimpeded,                            195"
8964,SCENE XII,'Tis the Emperor's will you grant him a detachment
8965,SCENE XII,Of eight horse-regiments from the army here.
8966,SCENE XII,
8967,SCENE XII,"_Wallenstein._ Yes, yes! I understand!--Eight regiments! Well,"
8968,SCENE XII,"Right well concerted, father Lamormain!"
8969,SCENE XII,"Eight thousand horse! Yes, yes! 'Tis as it should be!              200"
8970,SCENE XII,I see it coming!
8971,SCENE XII,
8972,SCENE XII,_Questenberg._   There is nothing coming.
8973,SCENE XII,"All stands in front: the counsel of state-prudence,"
8974,SCENE XII,The dictate of necessity!----
8975,SCENE XII,
8976,SCENE XII,_Wallenstein._                What then?
8977,SCENE XII,"What, my Lord Envoy? May I not be suffered"
8978,SCENE XII,"To understand, that folks are tired of seeing                      205"
8979,SCENE XII,The sword's hilt in my grasp: and that your court
8980,SCENE XII,"Snatch eagerly at this pretence, and use"
8981,SCENE XII,"The Spanish title, to drain off my forces,"
8982,SCENE XII,To lead into the empire a new army
8983,SCENE XII,Unsubjected to my control. To throw me                             210
8984,SCENE XII,"Plumply aside,--I am still too powerful for you"
8985,SCENE XII,"To venture that. My stipulation runs,"
8986,SCENE XII,That all the Imperial forces shall obey me
8987,SCENE XII,Where'er the German is the native language.
8988,SCENE XII,Of Spanish troops and of Prince Cardinals                          215
8989,SCENE XII,"That take their route, as visitors, through the empire,"
8990,SCENE XII,There stands no syllable in my stipulation.
8991,SCENE XII,No syllable! And so the politic court
8992,SCENE XII,"Steals in a-tiptoe, and creeps round behind it;"
8993,SCENE XII,"First makes me weaker, then to be dispensed with,                  220"
8994,SCENE XII,Till it dares strike at length a bolder blow
8995,SCENE XII,And make short work with me.
8996,SCENE XII,"What need of all these crooked ways, Lord Envoy?"
8997,SCENE XII,Straight-forward man! His compact with me pinches
8998,SCENE XII,The Emperor. He would that I moved off!--                          225
8999,SCENE XII,Well!--I will gratify him!
9000,SCENE XII,
9001,SCENE XII,[_Here there commences an agitation among the Generals
9002,SCENE XII,which increases continually._
9003,SCENE XII,
9004,SCENE XII,It grieves me for my noble officers' sakes!
9005,SCENE XII,"I see not yet, by what means they will come at"
9006,SCENE XII,"The moneys they have advanced, or how obtain"
9007,SCENE XII,The recompense their services demand.                              230
9008,SCENE XII,"Still a new leader brings new claimants forward,"
9009,SCENE XII,And prior merit superannuates quickly.
9010,SCENE XII,"There serve here many foreigners in the army,"
9011,SCENE XII,"And were the man in all else brave and gallant,"
9012,SCENE XII,I was not wont to make nice scrutiny                               235
9013,SCENE XII,After his pedigree or catechism.
9014,SCENE XII,"This will be otherwise, i'the time to come."
9015,SCENE XII,Well--me no longer it concerns.            [_He seats himself._
9016,SCENE XII,
9017,SCENE XII,"_Max Piccolomini._ Forbid it. Heaven, that it should come to this!"
9018,SCENE XII,Our troops will swell in dreadful fermentation--                   240
9019,SCENE XII,The Emperor is abused--it cannot be.
9020,SCENE XII,
9021,SCENE XII,_Isolani._ It cannot be; all goes to instant wreck.
9022,SCENE XII,
9023,SCENE XII,"_Wallenstein._ Thou hast said truly, faithful Isolani!"
9024,SCENE XII,"What we with toil and foresight have built up,"
9025,SCENE XII,Will go to wreck--all go to instant wreck.                         245
9026,SCENE XII,"What then? another chieftain is soon found,"
9027,SCENE XII,Another army likewise (who dares doubt it?)
9028,SCENE XII,Will flock from all sides to the Emperor
9029,SCENE XII,At the first beat of his recruiting drum.
9030,SCENE XII,
9031,SCENE XII,"[_During this speech, ISOLANI, TERTSKY, ILLO and MARADAS"
9032,SCENE XII,talk confusedly with great agitation._
9033,SCENE XII,

9037,SCENE XII,"Let me conjure you, Duke! Determine nothing,"
9038,SCENE XII,Till we have met and represented to you
9039,SCENE XII,"Our joint remonstrances.--Nay, calmer! Friends!"
9040,SCENE XII,I hope all may be yet set right again.
9041,SCENE XII,
9042,SCENE XII,_Tertsky._ Away! let us away! in the antechamber                   255
9043,SCENE XII,Find we the others.                                 [_They go._
9044,SCENE XII,
9045,SCENE XII,_Butler (to Questenberg)._ If good counsel gain
9046,SCENE XII,"Due audience from your wisdom, my Lord Envoy!"
9047,SCENE XII,You will be cautious how you shew yourself
9048,SCENE XII,In public for some hours to come--or hardly
9049,SCENE XII,Will that gold key protect you from maltreatment.                  260
9050,SCENE XII,
9051,SCENE XII,[_Commotions heard from without._
9052,SCENE XII,
9053,SCENE XII,"_Wallenstein._ A salutary counsel----Thou, Octavio!"
9054,SCENE XII,Wilt answer for the safety of our guest.
9055,SCENE XII,"Farewell, Von Questenberg!    [_QUESTENBERG is about to speak._"
9056,SCENE XII,"Nay, not a word."
9057,SCENE XII,Not one word more of that detested subject!
9058,SCENE XII,You have performed your duty--We know how                          265

9065,SCENE XII,_Goetz._ Where's he who means to rob us of our general?
9066,SCENE XII,
9067,SCENE XII,_Tiefenbach (at the same time)._ What are we forced to hear?

9140,SCENE I,To manage with the generals at the banquet?
9141,SCENE I,
9142,SCENE I,"_Illo._ Attend! We frame a formal declaration,"
9143,SCENE I,Wherein we to the Duke consign ourselves
9144,SCENE I,"Collectively, to be and to remain                                    5"
9145,SCENE I,"His both with life and limb, and not to spare"

9147,SCENE I,"So doing we infringe no oath nor duty,"
9148,SCENE I,We may be under to the Emperor.--Mark!
9149,SCENE I,This reservation we expressly make                                  10
9150,SCENE I,"In a particular clause, and save the conscience."
9151,SCENE I,Now hear! This formula so framed and worded
9152,SCENE I,Will be presented to them for perusal
9153,SCENE I,Before the banquet. No one will find in it
9154,SCENE I,Cause of offence or scruple. Hear now further!                      15
9155,SCENE I,"After the feast, when now the vap'ring wine"

9162,SCENE I,"That they'll believe themselves bound by an oath,"
9163,SCENE I,Which we had tricked them into by a juggle?
9164,SCENE I,
9165,SCENE I,_Illo._ We shall have caught and caged them! Let them then
9166,SCENE I,"Beat their wings bare against the wires, and rave"
9167,SCENE I,"Loud as they may against our treachery,                             25"
9168,SCENE I,At court their signatures will be believed
9169,SCENE I,Far more than their most holy affirmations.
9170,SCENE I,"Traitors they are, and must be; therefore wisely"
9171,SCENE I,Will make a virtue of necessity.

9177,SCENE I,"_Illo._ Besides, 'tis of subordinate importance"
9178,SCENE I,"How, or how far, we may thereby propel"
9179,SCENE I,The generals. 'Tis enough that we persuade                          35
9180,SCENE I,"The Duke, that they are his--Let him but act"
9181,SCENE I,"In his determined mood, as if he had them,"

9188,SCENE I,Ignorant of the ground where I was standing.
9189,SCENE I,"He lends the enemy his ear, permits me"

9191,SCENE I,Himself comes forward blank and undisguised;
9192,SCENE I,"Talks with us by the hour about his plans,"
9193,SCENE I,And when I think I have him--off at once----
9194,SCENE I,"He has slipped from me, and appears as if"
9195,SCENE I,"He had no scheme, but to retain his place.                          50"
9196,SCENE I,
9197,SCENE I,"_Illo._ He give up his old plans! I'll tell you, friend!"
9198,SCENE I,"His soul is occupied with nothing else,"
9199,SCENE I,"Even in his sleep--They are his thoughts, his dreams,"
9200,SCENE I,That day by day he questions for this purpose
9201,SCENE I,The motions of the planets----
9202,SCENE I,
9203,SCENE I,_Tertsky._                     Ay! you know                         55

9205,SCENE I,Shuts himself up in the astrological tower
9206,SCENE I,"To make joint observations--for I hear,"
9207,SCENE I,It is to be a night of weight and crisis;
9208,SCENE I,"And something great, and of long expectation,                       60"
9209,SCENE I,Is to make its procession in the heaven.
9210,SCENE I,
9211,SCENE I,_Illo._ Come! be we bold and make dispatch. The work
9212,SCENE I,In this next day or two must thrive and grow
9213,SCENE I,More than it has for years. And let but only
9214,SCENE I,Things first turn up auspicious here below----                      65
9215,SCENE I,Mark what I say--the right stars too will shew themselves.
9216,SCENE I,"Come, to the generals. All is in the glow,"
9217,SCENE I,And must be beaten while 'tis malleable.
9218,SCENE I,
9219,SCENE I,"_Tertsky._ Do you go thither, Illo. I must stay"
9220,SCENE I,And wait here for the Countess Tertsky. Know                        70
9221,SCENE I,"That we too are not idle. Break one string,"

9575,SCENE IV,"In your great father's arms, belov√©d lady!"
9576,SCENE IV,"All in a new world, which does homage to you,"
9577,SCENE IV,"And which, wer't only by its novelty,"
9578,SCENE IV,Delights your eye.
9579,SCENE IV,
9580,SCENE IV,_Thekla._          Yes; I confess to you                            40
9581,SCENE IV,"That many things delight me here: this camp,"
9582,SCENE IV,"This motley stage of warriors, which renews"
9583,SCENE IV,"So manifold the image of my fancy,"
9584,SCENE IV,"And binds to life, binds to reality,"
9585,SCENE IV,What hitherto had but been present to me                            45
9586,SCENE IV,As a sweet dream!
9587,SCENE IV,
9588,SCENE IV,_Max._            Alas! not so to me.
9589,SCENE IV,It makes a dream of my reality.
9590,SCENE IV,Upon some island in the ethereal heights
9591,SCENE IV,I've lived for these last days. This mass of men
9592,SCENE IV,Forces me down to earth. It is a bridge                             50
9593,SCENE IV,"That, reconducting to my former life,"
9594,SCENE IV,Divides me and my heaven.
9595,SCENE IV,
9596,SCENE IV,_Thekla._                 The game of life
9597,SCENE IV,"Looks cheerful, when one carries in one's heart"
9598,SCENE IV,"The inalienable treasure. 'Tis a game,"
9599,SCENE IV,"Which having once reviewed, I turn more joyous                      55"
9600,SCENE IV,Back to my deeper and appropriate bliss.
9601,SCENE IV,"In this short time that I've been present here,"
9602,SCENE IV,What new unheard-of things have I not seen!
9603,SCENE IV,And yet they all must give place to the wonder
9604,SCENE IV,Which this mysterious castle guards.
9605,SCENE IV,
9606,SCENE IV,_Countess._                          And what                       60
9607,SCENE IV,Can this be then? Methought I was acquainted
9608,SCENE IV,With all the dusky corners of this house.
9609,SCENE IV,
9610,SCENE IV,"_Thekla._ Ay, but the road thereto is watched by spirits,"
9611,SCENE IV,Two griffins still stand sentry at the door.
9612,SCENE IV,
9613,SCENE IV,_Countess (laughs)._ The astrological tower!--How happens it        65
9614,SCENE IV,"That this same sanctuary, whose access"
9615,SCENE IV,"Is to all others so impracticable,"
9616,SCENE IV,Opens before you even at your approach?
9617,SCENE IV,
9618,SCENE IV,_Thekla._ A dwarfish old man with a friendly face
9619,SCENE IV,"And snow-white hairs, whose gracious services                       70"
9620,SCENE IV,"Were mine at first sight, opened me the doors."
9621,SCENE IV,
9622,SCENE IV,"_Max._ That is the Duke's astrologer, old Seni."
9623,SCENE IV,
9624,SCENE IV,"_Thekla._ He questioned me on many points; for instance,"
9625,SCENE IV,"When I was born, what month, and on what day,"
9626,SCENE IV,Whether by day or in the night.
9627,SCENE IV,
9628,SCENE IV,_Countess._                     He wished                           75
9629,SCENE IV,To erect a figure for your horoscope.
9630,SCENE IV,
9631,SCENE IV,"_Thekla._ My hand too he examined, shook his head"
9632,SCENE IV,"With much sad meaning, and the lines methought,"
9633,SCENE IV,Did not square over truly with his wishes.
9634,SCENE IV,
9635,SCENE IV,"_Countess._ Well, Princess, and what found you in this tower?       80"
9636,SCENE IV,My highest privilege has been to snatch
9637,SCENE IV,"A side-glance, and away!"
9638,SCENE IV,
9639,SCENE IV,_Thekla._                [647:1]It was a strange
9640,SCENE IV,"Sensation that came o'er me, when at first"
9641,SCENE IV,From the broad sunshine I stepped in; and now
9642,SCENE IV,"The narrowing line of day-light, that ran after                     85"
9643,SCENE IV,"The closing door, was gone; and all about me"
9644,SCENE IV,"'Twas pale and dusky night, with many shadows"
9645,SCENE IV,Fantastically cast. Here six or seven
9646,SCENE IV,"Colossal statues, and all kings, stood round me"
9647,SCENE IV,In a half-circle. Each one in his hand                              90
9648,SCENE IV,"A sceptre bore, and on his head a star;"
9649,SCENE IV,And in the tower no other light was there
9650,SCENE IV,But from these stars: all seemed to come from them.
9651,SCENE IV,"'These are the planets,' said that low old man,"
9652,SCENE IV,"'They govern worldly fates, and for that cause                      95"
9653,SCENE IV,"Are imaged here as kings. He farthest from you,"
9654,SCENE IV,"Spiteful, and cold, an old man melancholy,"
9655,SCENE IV,"With bent and yellow forehead, he is Saturn."
9656,SCENE IV,"He opposite, the king with the red light,"
9657,SCENE IV,"An arm'd man for the battle, that is Mars:                         100"
9658,SCENE IV,And both these bring but little luck to man.'
9659,SCENE IV,"But at his side a lovely lady stood,"
9660,SCENE IV,"The star upon her head was soft and bright,"
9661,SCENE IV,"And that was Venus, the bright star of joy."
9662,SCENE IV,"On the left hand, lo! Mercury, with wings.                         105"
9663,SCENE IV,Quite in the middle glittered silver-bright
9664,SCENE IV,"A cheerful man, and with a monarch's mien;"
9665,SCENE IV,"And this was Jupiter, my father's star:"
9666,SCENE IV,And at his side I saw the Sun and Moon.
9667,SCENE IV,
9668,SCENE IV,_Max._ O never rudely will I blame his faith                       110
9669,SCENE IV,In the might of stars and angels! 'Tis not merely
9670,SCENE IV,The human being's Pride that peoples space
9671,SCENE IV,With life and mystical predominance;
9672,SCENE IV,Since likewise for the stricken heart of Love
9673,SCENE IV,"This visible nature, and this common world,                        115"
9674,SCENE IV,"Is all too narrow: yea, a deeper import"
9675,SCENE IV,Lurks in the legend told my infant years
9676,SCENE IV,"Than lies upon that truth, we live to learn."
9677,SCENE IV,"For fable is Love's world, his home, his birth-place;"
9678,SCENE IV,"Delightedly dwells he 'mong fays and talismans,                    120"
9679,SCENE IV,And spirits; and delightedly believes
9680,SCENE IV,"Divinities, being himself divine."
9681,SCENE IV,"The intelligible forms of ancient poets,"
9682,SCENE IV,"The fair humanities of old religion,"
9683,SCENE IV,"The Power, the Beauty, and the Majesty,                            125"
9684,SCENE IV,"That had their haunts in dale, or piny mountain,"
9685,SCENE IV,"Or forest by slow stream, or pebbly spring,"
9686,SCENE IV,Or chasms and wat'ry depths; all these have vanished.
9687,SCENE IV,They live no longer in the faith of reason!
9688,SCENE IV,"But still the heart doth need a language, still                    130"
9689,SCENE IV,"Doth the old instinct bring back the old names,"
9690,SCENE IV,"And to yon starry world they now are gone,"
9691,SCENE IV,"Spirits or gods, that used to share this earth"
9692,SCENE IV,With man as with their friend;[649:1] and to the lover
9693,SCENE IV,"Yonder they move, from yonder visible sky                          135"
9694,SCENE IV,Shoot influence down: and even at this day
9695,SCENE IV,"'Tis Jupiter who brings whate'er is great,"
9696,SCENE IV,And Venus who brings every thing that's fair!
9697,SCENE IV,
9698,SCENE IV,"_Thekla._ And if this be the science of the stars,"
9699,SCENE IV,"I too, with glad and zealous industry,                             140"
9700,SCENE IV,Will learn acquaintance with this cheerful faith.
9701,SCENE IV,"It is a gentle and affectionate thought,"
9702,SCENE IV,"That in immeasurable heights above us,"
9703,SCENE IV,"At our first birth, the wreath of love was woven,"
9704,SCENE IV,With sparkling stars for flowers.
9705,SCENE IV,
9706,SCENE IV,"_Countess._                       Not only roses,                  145"
9707,SCENE IV,But thorns too hath the heaven; and well for you
9708,SCENE IV,Leave they your wreath of love inviolate;
9709,SCENE IV,"What Venus twined, the bearer of glad fortune,"
9710,SCENE IV,The sullen orb of Mars soon tears to pieces.
9711,SCENE IV,
9712,SCENE IV,_Max._ Soon will his gloomy empire reach its close.                150
9713,SCENE IV,Blest be the General's zeal: into the laurel
9714,SCENE IV,"Will he inweave the olive-branch, presenting"
9715,SCENE IV,Peace to the shouting nations. Then no wish
9716,SCENE IV,Will have remained for his great heart! Enough
9717,SCENE IV,"Has he performed for glory, and can now                            155"
9718,SCENE IV,Live for himself and his. To his domains
9719,SCENE IV,Will he retire; he has a stately seat
9720,SCENE IV,"Of fairest view at Gitschin; Reichenberg,"
9721,SCENE IV,"And Friedland Castle, both lie pleasantly--"
9722,SCENE IV,Even to the foot of the huge mountains here                        160
9723,SCENE IV,Stretches the chase and covers of his forests:
9724,SCENE IV,"His ruling passion, to create the splendid,"
9725,SCENE IV,He can indulge without restraint; can give
9726,SCENE IV,"A princely patronage to every art,"
9727,SCENE IV,And to all worth a Sovereign's protection.                         165
9728,SCENE IV,"Can build, can plant, can watch the starry courses--"
9729,SCENE IV,
9730,SCENE IV,"_Countess._ Yet I would have you look, and look again,"
9731,SCENE IV,"Before you lay aside your arms, young friend!"
9732,SCENE IV,"A gentle bride, as she is, is well worth it,"
9733,SCENE IV,That you should woo and win her with the sword.                    170
9734,SCENE IV,
9735,SCENE IV,"_Max._ O, that the sword could win her!"
9736,SCENE IV,
9737,SCENE IV,_Countess._                             What was that?

10174,SCENE VII,"_Countess._ What? he has vanquished all impediment,                 90"
10175,SCENE VII,And in the wilful mood of his own daughter
10176,SCENE VII,Shall a new struggle rise for him? Child! child!
10177,SCENE VII,As yet thou hast seen thy father's smiles alone;
10178,SCENE VII,"The eye of his rage thou hast not seen. Dear child,"
10179,SCENE VII,"I will not frighten thee. To that extreme,                          95"
10180,SCENE VII,"I trust, it ne'er shall come. His will is yet"
10181,SCENE VII,Unknown to me: 'tis possible his aims
10182,SCENE VII,May have the same direction as thy wish.
10183,SCENE VII,"But this can never, never be his will,"
10184,SCENE VII,"That thou, the daughter of his haughty fortunes,                   100"
10185,SCENE VII,Should'st e'er demean thee as a love-sick maiden;
10186,SCENE VII,"And like some poor cost-nothing, fling thyself"
10187,SCENE VII,"Toward the man, who, if that high prize ever"
10188,SCENE VII,"Be destined to await him, yet, with sacrifices"
10189,SCENE VII,"The highest love can bring, must pay for it.  [_Exit COUNTESS._    105"

10580,SCENE XII,_Runner._ The same!--a health is to go round in him.                30
10581,SCENE XII,
10582,SCENE XII,_Master of the Cellar._ This will be something for the
10583,SCENE XII,tale-bearers--this goes to Vienna.
10584,SCENE XII,
10585,SCENE XII,"_Neumann._ Permit me to look at it.--Well, this is a cup"
10586,SCENE XII,"indeed! How heavy! as well it may be, being all"
10587,SCENE XII,gold.--And what neat things are embossed on it! how natural         35
10588,SCENE XII,"and elegant they look! There, on that first quarter, let me"
10589,SCENE XII,"see. That proud Amazon there on horseback, she that is"
10590,SCENE XII,"taking a leap over the crosier and mitres, and carries on a"
10591,SCENE XII,"wand a hat together with a banner, on which there's"
10592,SCENE XII,a goblet represented. Can you tell me what all this signifies?      40
10593,SCENE XII,
10594,SCENE XII,_Master of the Cellar._ The woman whom you see there on
10595,SCENE XII,"horseback, is the Free Election of the Bohemian Crown."
10596,SCENE XII,"That is signified by the round hat, and by that fiery steed"
10597,SCENE XII,on which she is riding. The hat is the pride of man; for
10598,SCENE XII,he who cannot keep his hat on before kings and emperors             45
10599,SCENE XII,is no free man.
10600,SCENE XII,
10601,SCENE XII,_Neumann._ But what is the cup there on the banner?
10602,SCENE XII,
10603,SCENE XII,_Master of the Cellar._ The cup signifies the freedom of the
10604,SCENE XII,"Bohemian Church, as it was in our forefathers' times. Our"
10605,SCENE XII,forefathers in the wars of the Hussites forced from the Pope        50
10606,SCENE XII,"this noble privilege: for the Pope, you know, will not grant"
10607,SCENE XII,the cup to any layman. Your true Moravian values nothing
10608,SCENE XII,"beyond the cup; it is his costly jewel, and has cost the"
10609,SCENE XII,Bohemians their precious blood in many and many a battle.
10610,SCENE XII,
10611,SCENE XII,_Neumann._ And what says that chart that hangs in the air           55
10612,SCENE XII,"there, over it all?"
10613,SCENE XII,
10614,SCENE XII,_Master of the Cellar._ That signifies the Bohemian letter
10615,SCENE XII,"royal, which we forced from the Emperor Rudolph--a"
10616,SCENE XII,"precious, never to be enough valued parchment that secures"
10617,SCENE XII,to the new Church the old privileges of free ringing and            60
10618,SCENE XII,open psalmody. But since he of Steierm√§rk has ruled over
10619,SCENE XII,"us, that is at an end; and after the battle of Prague, in"
10620,SCENE XII,"which Count Palatine Frederick lost crown and empire, our"
10621,SCENE XII,faith hangs upon the pulpit and the altar--and our brethren
10622,SCENE XII,look at their homes over their shoulders; but the letter            65
10623,SCENE XII,royal the Emperor himself cut to pieces with his scissors.
10624,SCENE XII,
10625,SCENE XII,"_Neumann._ Why, my good Master of the Cellar! you are"
10626,SCENE XII,deep read in the chronicles of your country!
10627,SCENE XII,
10628,SCENE XII,"_Master of the Cellar._ So were my forefathers, and for that"
10629,SCENE XII,"reason were they minstrels, and served under Procopius and          70"
10630,SCENE XII,"Ziska. Peace be with their ashes! Well, well! they fought"
10631,SCENE XII,for a good cause though--There! carry it up!
10632,SCENE XII,
10633,SCENE XII,_Neumann._ Stay! let me but look at this second quarter.
10634,SCENE XII,"Look there! That is, when at Prague Castle the Imperial"
10635,SCENE XII,"Counsellors, Martinitz and Stawata were hurled down head            75"
10636,SCENE XII,over heels. 'Tis even so! there stands Count Thur who
10637,SCENE XII,commands it.
10638,SCENE XII,
10639,SCENE XII,[Runner _takes the service-cup and goes off with it._
10640,SCENE XII,
10641,SCENE XII,_Master of the Cellar._ O let me never more hear of that day.
10642,SCENE XII,"It was the three and twentieth of May, in the year of our"
10643,SCENE XII,"Lord one thousand, six hundred, and eighteen. It seems to me        80"
10644,SCENE XII,"as it were but yesterday--from that unlucky day it all began,"
10645,SCENE XII,all the heart-aches of the country. Since that day it is now
10646,SCENE XII,"sixteen years, and there has never once been peace on the earth."
10647,SCENE XII,
10648,SCENE XII,[_Health drunk aloud at the second table._
10649,SCENE XII,
10650,SCENE XII,The Prince of Weimar! Hurra!
10651,SCENE XII,
10652,SCENE XII,[_At the third and fourth table._
10653,SCENE XII,
10654,SCENE XII,Long live Prince William! Long live Duke Bernard!                   85
10655,SCENE XII,Hurra!                                     [_Music strikes up._
10656,SCENE XII,
10657,SCENE XII,_First Servant._ Hear 'em! Hear 'em! What an uproar!
10658,SCENE XII,
10659,SCENE XII,_Second Servant (comes in running)._ Did you hear? They have
10660,SCENE XII,drunk the Prince of Weimar's health.
10661,SCENE XII,
10662,SCENE XII,_Third Servant._ The Swedish Chief Commander!                       90
10663,SCENE XII,
10664,SCENE XII,_First Servant (speaking at the same time)._ The Lutheran!
10665,SCENE XII,
10666,SCENE XII,"_Second Servant._ Just before, when Count Deodate gave out"
10667,SCENE XII,"the Emperor's health, they were all as mum as a nibbling"
10668,SCENE XII,mouse.
10669,SCENE XII,
10670,SCENE XII,"_Master of the Cellar._ Po, po! When the wine goes in,              95"
10671,SCENE XII,"strange things come out. A good servant hears, and hears"
10672,SCENE XII,"not!--You should be nothing but eyes and feet, except when"
10673,SCENE XII,you are called.
10674,SCENE XII,
10675,SCENE XII,"_Second Servant (to the Runner, to whom he gives secretly a flask"
10676,SCENE XII,"of wine, keeping his eye on the Master of the Cellar, standing"
10677,SCENE XII,"between him and the Runner)._ Quick, Thomas! before the"
10678,SCENE XII,Master of the Cellar runs this way--'tis a flask of                100
10679,SCENE XII,Frontignac!--Snapped it up at the third table.--Canst go off
10680,SCENE XII,with it?
10681,SCENE XII,
10682,SCENE XII,_Runner (hides it in his pocket)._ All right!
10683,SCENE XII,
10684,SCENE XII,[_Exit the_ Second Servant.
10685,SCENE XII,
10686,SCENE XII,"_Third Servant (aside to the First)._ Be on the hark, Jack! that"
10687,SCENE XII,we may have right plenty to tell to father Quivoga--He will        105
10688,SCENE XII,give us right plenty of absolution in return for it.
10689,SCENE XII,
10690,SCENE XII,_First Servant._ For that very purpose I am always having
10691,SCENE XII,something to do behind Illo's chair.--He is the man for speeches
10692,SCENE XII,to make you stare with!
10693,SCENE XII,
10694,SCENE XII,"_Master of the Cellar (to Neumann)._ Who, pray, may that           110"
10695,SCENE XII,"swarthy man be, he with the cross, that is chatting so"
10696,SCENE XII,confidentially with Esterhats?
10697,SCENE XII,
10698,SCENE XII,_Neumann._ Ay! he too is one of those to whom they confide
10699,SCENE XII,"too much. He calls himself Maradas, a Spaniard is he."
10700,SCENE XII,
10701,SCENE XII,_Master of the Cellar (impatiently)._ Spaniard! Spaniard!--I       115
10702,SCENE XII,"tell you, friend; nothing good comes of those Spaniards. All"
10703,SCENE XII,these out-landish[665:1] fellows are little better than rogues.
10704,SCENE XII,
10705,SCENE XII,"_Neumann._ Fy, fy! you should not say so, friend. There are"
10706,SCENE XII,"among them our very best generals, and those on whom the"
10707,SCENE XII,Duke at this moment relies the most.                               120
10708,SCENE XII,
10709,SCENE XII,_Master of the Cellar (taking the flask out of the Runner's
10710,SCENE XII,pocket)._

10717,SCENE XII,_Master of the Cellar (to the Servants)._ The Lieutenant-General

11063,SCENE XIV,
11064,SCENE XIV,_Max._ What is there here then of such perilous import?

11073,SCENE XIV,"_Goetz._ Why, I seemed to think so too."
11074,SCENE XIV,
11075,SCENE XIV,_Isolani._ What do I care for that? Where there stand other         65

11080,SCENE XIV,
11081,SCENE XIV,"_Butler (to one of the commanders)._ For shame, for shame!"

11083,SCENE XIV,"now is, whether we shall keep our General, or let him retire."
11084,SCENE XIV,One must not take these things too nicely and
11085,SCENE XIV,over-scrupulously.
11086,SCENE XIV,
11087,SCENE XIV,_Isolani (to one of the Generals)._ Did the Duke make any of
11088,SCENE XIV,these provisos when he gave you your regiment?                      75
11089,SCENE XIV,
11090,SCENE XIV,_Tertsky (to Goetz)._ Or when he gave you the office of
11091,SCENE XIV,"army-purveyancer, which brings you in yearly a thousand pistoles!"
11092,SCENE XIV,
11093,SCENE XIV,_Illo._ He is a rascal who makes us out to be rogues. If
11094,SCENE XIV,"there be any one that wants satisfaction, let him say so,--I am"
11095,SCENE XIV,his man.                                                            80

11209,SCENE I,The signature they fain had wrested from thee?
11210,SCENE I,
11211,SCENE I,_Max._ It was a serious business----I was absent--
11212,SCENE I,The affair itself seemed not so urgent to me.                       25
11213,SCENE I,
11214,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ Be open, Max. Thou hadst then no suspicion?"

11268,SCENE I,"_Octavio._                        That mouth,"
11269,SCENE I,"From which thou hearest it at this present moment,"
11270,SCENE I,Doth warrant thee that it is no Priest's legend.
11271,SCENE I,
11272,SCENE I,_Max._ How mere a maniac they supposed the Duke!
11273,SCENE I,"What, he can meditate?--the Duke?--can dream                        70"
11274,SCENE I,That he can lure away full thirty thousand
11275,SCENE I,"Tried troops and true, all honourable soldiers,"
11276,SCENE I,"More than a thousand noblemen among them,"
11277,SCENE I,"From oaths, from duty, from their honour lure them,"
11278,SCENE I,And make them all unanimous to do                                   75
11279,SCENE I,A deed that brands them scoundrels?
11280,SCENE I,
11281,SCENE I,"_Octavio._                          Such a deed,"
11282,SCENE I,"With such a front of infamy, the Duke"
11283,SCENE I,No wise desires--what he requires of us
11284,SCENE I,Bears a far gentler appellation. Nothing
11285,SCENE I,"He wishes, but to give the Empire peace.                            80"
11286,SCENE I,"And so, because the Emperor hates this peace,"
11287,SCENE I,Therefore the Duke--the Duke will force him to it.
11288,SCENE I,"All parts of the Empire will he pacify,"
11289,SCENE I,And for his trouble will retain in payment
11290,SCENE I,(What he has already in his gripe)--Bohemia!                        85
11291,SCENE I,
11292,SCENE I,"_Max._ Has he, Octavio, merited of us,"
11293,SCENE I,That we--that we should think so vilely of him?
11294,SCENE I,
11295,SCENE I,_Octavio._ What we would think is not the question here.
11296,SCENE I,The affair speaks for itself--and clearest proofs!
11297,SCENE I,"Hear me, my son--'tis not unknown to thee,                          90"
11298,SCENE I,In what ill credit with the Court we stand.
11299,SCENE I,"But little dost thou know, or guess, what tricks,"
11300,SCENE I,"What base intrigues, what lying artifices,"
11301,SCENE I,Have been employed--for this sole end--to sow
11302,SCENE I,Mutiny in the camp! All bands are loosed--                          95
11303,SCENE I,"Loosed all the bands, that link the officer"
11304,SCENE I,"To his liege Emperor, all that bind the soldier"
11305,SCENE I,Affectionately to the citizen.
11306,SCENE I,"Lawless he stands, and threateningly beleaguers"
11307,SCENE I,The state he's bound to guard. To such a height                    100
11308,SCENE I,"'Tis swoln, that at this hour the Emperor"
11309,SCENE I,Before his armies--his own armies--trembles;
11310,SCENE I,"Yea, in his capital, his palace, fears"
11311,SCENE I,"The traitor's poniards, and is meditating"
11312,SCENE I,To hurry off and hide his tender offspring----                     105
11313,SCENE I,"Not from the Swedes, not from the Lutherans--"
11314,SCENE I,No! from his own troops hide and hurry them!
11315,SCENE I,
11316,SCENE I,"_Max._ Cease, cease! thou tortur'st, shatter'st me. I know"
11317,SCENE I,That oft we tremble at an empty terror;
11318,SCENE I,But the false phantasm brings a real misery.                       110
11319,SCENE I,
11320,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ It is no phantasm. An intestine war,"
11321,SCENE I,"Of all the most unnatural and cruel,"
11322,SCENE I,"Will burst out into flames, if instantly"
11323,SCENE I,We do not fly and stifle it. The Generals
11324,SCENE I,Are many of them long ago won over;                                115
11325,SCENE I,The subalterns are vacillating--whole
11326,SCENE I,Regiments and garrisons are vacillating.
11327,SCENE I,To foreigners our strong holds are entrusted;
11328,SCENE I,To that suspected Schafgotch is the whole
11329,SCENE I,Force of Silesia given up: to Tertsky                              120
11330,SCENE I,"Five regiments, foot and horse--to Isolani,"
11331,SCENE I,"To Illo, Kinsky, Butler, the best troops."
11332,SCENE I,
11333,SCENE I,_Max._ Likewise to both of us.
11334,SCENE I,
11335,SCENE I,_Octavio._                     Because the Duke
11336,SCENE I,Believes he has secured us--means to lure us
11337,SCENE I,Still further on by splendid promises.                             125
11338,SCENE I,"To me he portions forth the princedoms, Glatz"
11339,SCENE I,And Sagan; and too plain I see the angle
11340,SCENE I,With which he doubts not to catch thee.
11341,SCENE I,
11342,SCENE I,_Max._                                  No! no!
11343,SCENE I,I tell thee--no!
11344,SCENE I,
11345,SCENE I,_Octavio._       O open yet thine eyes!
11346,SCENE I,And to what purpose think'st thou he has called us                 130
11347,SCENE I,Hither to Pilsen?--to avail himself
11348,SCENE I,Of our advice?--O when did Friedland ever
11349,SCENE I,"Need our advice?--Be calm, and listen to me."
11350,SCENE I,"To sell ourselves are we called hither, and,"
11351,SCENE I,Decline we that--to be his hostages.                               135
11352,SCENE I,Therefore doth noble Galas stand aloof;
11353,SCENE I,"Thy father, too, thou would'st not have seen here,"
11354,SCENE I,If higher duties had not held him fettered.
11355,SCENE I,
11356,SCENE I,_Max._ He makes no secret of it--needs make none--
11357,SCENE I,That we're called hither for his sake--he owns it.                 140
11358,SCENE I,He needs our aidance to maintain himself--
11359,SCENE I,He did so much for us; and 'tis but fair
11360,SCENE I,That we too should do somewhat now for him.
11361,SCENE I,
11362,SCENE I,_Octavio._ And know'st thou what it is which we must do?
11363,SCENE I,That Illo's drunken mood betrayed it to thee.                      145
11364,SCENE I,"Bethink thyself--what hast thou heard, what seen?"
11365,SCENE I,The counterfeited paper--the omission
11366,SCENE I,"Of that particular clause, so full of meaning,"
11367,SCENE I,"Does it not prove, that they would bind us down"
11368,SCENE I,To nothing good?
11369,SCENE I,
11370,SCENE I,_Max._           That counterfeited paper                          150
11371,SCENE I,Appears to me no other than a trick
11372,SCENE I,Of Illo's own device. These underhand
11373,SCENE I,Traders in great men's interests ever use
11374,SCENE I,To urge and hurry all things to the extreme.
11375,SCENE I,"They see the Duke at variance with the court,                      155"
11376,SCENE I,"And fondly think to serve him, when they widen"
11377,SCENE I,"The breach irreparably. Trust me, father,"
11378,SCENE I,The Duke knows nothing of all this.
11379,SCENE I,
11380,SCENE I,_Octavio._                          It grieves me
11381,SCENE I,"That I must dash to earth, that I must shatter"
11382,SCENE I,A faith so specious; but I may not spare thee!                     160
11383,SCENE I,For this is not a time for tenderness.
11384,SCENE I,"Thou must take measures, speedy ones--must act."
11385,SCENE I,"I therefore will confess to thee, that all"
11386,SCENE I,Which I've entrusted to thee now--that all
11387,SCENE I,"Which seems to thee so unbelievable,                               165"
11388,SCENE I,"That--yes, I will tell thee--Max! I had it all"
11389,SCENE I,From his own mouth--from the Duke's mouth I had it.
11390,SCENE I,
11391,SCENE I,_Max._ No!--no!--never!
11392,SCENE I,
11393,SCENE I,_Octavio._              Himself confided to me
11394,SCENE I,"What I, 'tis true, had long before discovered"
11395,SCENE I,"By other means--himself confided to me,                            170"
11396,SCENE I,That 'twas his settled plan to join the Swedes;
11397,SCENE I,"And, at the head of the united armies,"
11398,SCENE I,Compel the Emperor--
11399,SCENE I,
11400,SCENE I,_Max._               He is passionate.
11401,SCENE I,The Court has stung him--he is sore all over
11402,SCENE I,With injuries and affronts; and in a moment                        175
11403,SCENE I,"Of irritation, what if he, for once,"
11404,SCENE I,Forgot himself? He's an impetuous man.
11405,SCENE I,
11406,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ Nay, in cold blood he did confess this to me:"
11407,SCENE I,And having construed my astonishment
11408,SCENE I,"Into a scruple of his power, he shewed me                          180"
11409,SCENE I,"His written evidences--shewed me letters,"
11410,SCENE I,"Both from the Saxon and the Swede, that gave"
11411,SCENE I,"Promise of aidance, and defin'd the amount."
11412,SCENE I,
11413,SCENE I,_Max._ It cannot be!--can _not_ be! _can_ not be!
11414,SCENE I,"Dost thou not see, it cannot!                                      185"
11415,SCENE I,Thou wouldest of necessity have shewn him
11416,SCENE I,"Such horror, such deep loathing--that or he"
11417,SCENE I,"Had taken thee for his better genius, or"
11418,SCENE I,Thou stood'st not now a living man before me--
11419,SCENE I,
11420,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ I have laid open my objections to him,                  190"
11421,SCENE I,Dissuaded him with pressing earnestness;
11422,SCENE I,"But my abhorrence, the full sentiment"
11423,SCENE I,Of my whole heart--that I have still kept sacred
11424,SCENE I,To my own consciousness.
11425,SCENE I,
11426,SCENE I,_Max._                   And thou hast been
11427,SCENE I,So treacherous? That looks not like my father!                     195
11428,SCENE I,"I trusted not thy words, when thou didst tell me"
11429,SCENE I,"Evil of him; much less can I now do it,"
11430,SCENE I,That thou calumniatest thy own self.
11431,SCENE I,
11432,SCENE I,_Octavio._ I did not thrust myself into his secrecy.
11433,SCENE I,
11434,SCENE I,_Max._ Uprightness merited his confidence.                         200
11435,SCENE I,
11436,SCENE I,_Octavio._ He was no longer worthy of sincerity.
11437,SCENE I,
11438,SCENE I,"_Max._ Dissimulation, sure, was still less worthy"
11439,SCENE I,"Of thee, Octavio!"
11440,SCENE I,
11441,SCENE I,_Octavio._        Gave I him a cause
11442,SCENE I,To entertain a scruple of my honour?
11443,SCENE I,
11444,SCENE I,"_Max._ That he did not, evinced his confidence.                    205"
11445,SCENE I,
11446,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ Dear son, it is not always possible"
11447,SCENE I,Still to preserve that infant purity
11448,SCENE I,Which the voice teaches in our inmost heart.
11449,SCENE I,"Still in alarm, for ever on the watch"
11450,SCENE I,"Against the wiles of wicked men, e'en Virtue                       210"
11451,SCENE I,Will sometimes bear away her outward robes
11452,SCENE I,Soiled in the wrestle with Iniquity.
11453,SCENE I,"This is the curse of every evil deed,"
11454,SCENE I,"That, propagating still, it brings forth evil."
11455,SCENE I,I do not cheat my better soul with sophisms:                       215
11456,SCENE I,I but perform my orders; the Emperor
11457,SCENE I,"Prescribes my conduct to me. Dearest boy,"
11458,SCENE I,"Far better were it, doubtless, if we all"
11459,SCENE I,"Obeyed the heart at all times; but so doing,"
11460,SCENE I,"In this our present sojourn with bad men,                          220"
11461,SCENE I,We must abandon many an honest object.
11462,SCENE I,"'Tis now our call to serve the Emperor,"
11463,SCENE I,By what means he can best be served--the heart
11464,SCENE I,May whisper what it will--this is our call!
11465,SCENE I,
11466,SCENE I,"_Max._ It seems a thing appointed, that to-day                     225"
11467,SCENE I,"I should not comprehend, not understand thee."
11468,SCENE I,The Duke thou say'st did honestly pour out
11469,SCENE I,"His heart to thee, but for an evil purpose;"
11470,SCENE I,And thou dishonestly hast cheated him
11471,SCENE I,"For a good purpose! Silence, I entreat thee--                      230"
11472,SCENE I,My friend thou stealest not from me--
11473,SCENE I,Let me not lose my father!
11474,SCENE I,
11475,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ As yet thou know'st not all, my son. I have"
11476,SCENE I,Yet somewhat to disclose to thee.             [_After a pause._
11477,SCENE I,Duke Friedland
11478,SCENE I,Hath made his preparations. He relies                              235
11479,SCENE I,"Upon his stars. He deems us unprovided,"
11480,SCENE I,And thinks to fall upon us by surprise.
11481,SCENE I,"Yea, in his dream of hope, he grasps already"
11482,SCENE I,The golden circle in his hand. He errs.
11483,SCENE I,We too have been in action--he but grasps                          240
11484,SCENE I,"His evil fate, most evil, most mysterious!"
11485,SCENE I,
11486,SCENE I,"_Max._ O nothing rash, my sire! By all that's good"
11487,SCENE I,Let me invoke thee--no precipitation!
11488,SCENE I,
11489,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ With light tread stole he on his evil way,"
11490,SCENE I,With light tread hath Vengeance stole on after him.                245
11491,SCENE I,"Unseen she stands already, dark behind him--"
11492,SCENE I,But one step more--he shudders in her grasp!
11493,SCENE I,Thou hast seen Questenberg with me. As yet
11494,SCENE I,Thou know'st but his ostensible commission;
11495,SCENE I,"He brought with him a private one, my son!                         250"
11496,SCENE I,And that was for me only.
11497,SCENE I,
11498,SCENE I,_Max._                    May I know it?
11499,SCENE I,
11500,SCENE I,_Octavio (seizes the patent)._           Max!       [_A pause._
11501,SCENE I,----In this disclosure place I in thy hands
11502,SCENE I,The Empire's welfare and thy father's life.
11503,SCENE I,Dear to thy inmost heart is Wallenstein:
11504,SCENE I,"A powerful tie of love, of veneration,                             255"
11505,SCENE I,Hath knit thee to him from thy earliest youth.
11506,SCENE I,Thou nourishest the wish.--O let me still
11507,SCENE I,Anticipate thy loitering confidence!
11508,SCENE I,The hope thou nourishest to knit thyself
11509,SCENE I,Yet closer to him----
11510,SCENE I,
11511,SCENE I,_Max._                Father----
11512,SCENE I,
11513,SCENE I,_Octavio._                       O my son!                         260
11514,SCENE I,I trust thy heart undoubtingly. But am I
11515,SCENE I,Equally sure of thy collectedness?
11516,SCENE I,"Wilt thou be able, with calm countenance,"
11517,SCENE I,"To enter this man's presence, when that I"
11518,SCENE I,Have trusted to thee his whole fate?
11519,SCENE I,
11520,SCENE I,_Max._                               According                     265
11521,SCENE I,"As thou dost trust me, father, with his crime."
11522,SCENE I,
11523,SCENE I,"[_OCTAVIO takes a paper out of his escrutoire, and gives"
11524,SCENE I,it to him._
11525,SCENE I,
11526,SCENE I,_Max._ What? how? a full Imperial patent!
11527,SCENE I,
11528,SCENE I,_Octavio._                                Read it.
11529,SCENE I,
11530,SCENE I,_Max (just glances on it)._ Duke Friedland sentenced and condemned!
11531,SCENE I,
11532,SCENE I,_Octavio._ Even so.
11533,SCENE I,
11534,SCENE I,_Max (throws down the paper)._ O this is too much! O unhappy
11535,SCENE I,error!                                                         270
11536,SCENE I,
11537,SCENE I,_Octavio._ Read on. Collect thyself.
11538,SCENE I,
11539,SCENE I,"_Max (after he has read further, with a look of affright and"
11540,SCENE I,astonishment on his father)._ How! what! Thou! thou!
11541,SCENE I,
11542,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ But for the present moment, till the King"
11543,SCENE I,"Of Hungary may safely join the army,"
11544,SCENE I,Is the command assigned to me.
11545,SCENE I,
11546,SCENE I,"_Max._                         And think'st thou,"
11547,SCENE I,"Dost thou believe, that thou wilt tear it from him?                275"
11548,SCENE I,O never hope it!--Father! father! father!
11549,SCENE I,An inauspicious office is enjoined thee.
11550,SCENE I,This paper here--this! and wilt thou enforce it?
11551,SCENE I,"The mighty in the middle of his host,"
11552,SCENE I,"Surrounded by his thousands, him would'st thou                     280"
11553,SCENE I,"Disarm--degrade! Thou art lost, both thou and all of us."
11554,SCENE I,
11555,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ What hazard I incur thereby, I know."
11556,SCENE I,In the great hand of God I stand. The Almighty
11557,SCENE I,"Will cover with his shield the Imperial house,"
11558,SCENE I,"And shatter, in his wrath, the work of darkness.                   285"
11559,SCENE I,The Emperor hath true servants still; and even
11560,SCENE I,"Here in the camp, there are enough brave men,"
11561,SCENE I,Who for the good cause will fight gallantly.
11562,SCENE I,The faithful have been warned--the dangerous
11563,SCENE I,"Are closely watched. I wait but the first step,                    290"
11564,SCENE I,And then immediately----
11565,SCENE I,
11566,SCENE I,_Max._                   What! on suspicion?
11567,SCENE I,Immediately?
11568,SCENE I,
11569,SCENE I,_Octavio._   The Emperor is no tyrant.
11570,SCENE I,"The deed alone he'll punish, not the wish."
11571,SCENE I,The Duke hath yet his destiny in his power.
11572,SCENE I,"Let him but leave the treason uncompleted,                         295"
11573,SCENE I,"He will be silently displaced from office,"
11574,SCENE I,And make way to his Emperor's royal son.
11575,SCENE I,An honourable exile to his castles
11576,SCENE I,Will be a benefaction to him rather
11577,SCENE I,Than punishment. But the first open step----                       300
11578,SCENE I,
11579,SCENE I,_Max._ What callest thou such a step? A wicked step

11587,SCENE I,To leave this paper wholly uninforced
11588,SCENE I,Till some act is committed which convicts him
11589,SCENE I,"Of a high-treason, without doubt or plea,                          310"

11601,SCENE I,Secure of the majority with us;
11602,SCENE I,And of the army's general sentiment
11603,SCENE I,He hath a pleasing proof in that petition
11604,SCENE I,Which thou delivered'st to him from the regiments.                 320
11605,SCENE I,Add this too--I have letters that the Rhinegrave
11606,SCENE I,"Hath changed his route, and travels by forced marches"
11607,SCENE I,"To the Bohemian Forest. What this purports,"
11608,SCENE I,"Remains unknown; and, to confirm suspicion,"

11610,SCENE I,
11611,SCENE I,_Max._ I have thy word. Thou'lt not proceed to action
11612,SCENE I,Before thou hast convinced me--me myself.
11613,SCENE I,
11614,SCENE I,"_Octavio._ Is it possible? Still, after all thou know'st,"
11615,SCENE I,Canst thou believe still in his innocence?
11616,SCENE I,
11617,SCENE I,_Max._ Thy judgment may mistake; my heart can not.                 330
11618,SCENE I,These reasons might expound thy spirit or mine;
11619,SCENE I,But they expound not Friedland--I have faith:

11621,SCENE I,"Even so doth he resemble them in secret,"

11765,SCENE II,
11766,SCENE II,_Octavio._ And old Sesina?
11767,SCENE II,
11768,SCENE II,"_Cornet._                  He was sorely frightened,"

11770,SCENE II,"But the Count Altringer bade him take heart,"

11774,SCENE II,That he lay sick at Linz.

12226,SCENE IV,"My serious meaning, it was ne'er resolve."
12227,SCENE IV,I but amused myself with thinking of it.
12228,SCENE IV,"The free-will tempted me, the power to do"
12229,SCENE IV,Or not to do it.--Was it criminal
12230,SCENE IV,"To make the fancy minister to hope,                                 15"
12231,SCENE IV,"To fill the air with pretty toys of air,"
12232,SCENE IV,And clutch fantastic sceptres moving t'ward me?
12233,SCENE IV,Was not the will kept free? Beheld I not
12234,SCENE IV,The road of duty close beside me--but
12235,SCENE IV,"One little step, and once more I was in it!                         20"
12236,SCENE IV,Where am I? Whither have I been transported?
12237,SCENE IV,"No road, no track behind me, but a wall,"
12238,SCENE IV,"Impenetrable, insurmountable,"
12239,SCENE IV,Rises obedient to the spells I muttered
12240,SCENE IV,And meant not--my own doings tower behind me.                       25
12241,SCENE IV,"A punishable man I seem, the guilt,"
12242,SCENE IV,"Try what I will, I cannot roll off from me;"
12243,SCENE IV,The equivocal demeanour of my life
12244,SCENE IV,Bears witness on my prosecutor's party;
12245,SCENE IV,And even my purest acts from purest motives                         30
12246,SCENE IV,Suspicion poisons with malicious gloss.
12247,SCENE IV,"Were I that thing, for which I pass, that traitor,"
12248,SCENE IV,"A goodly outside I had sure reserved,"
12249,SCENE IV,"Had drawn the coverings thick and double round me,"
12250,SCENE IV,Been calm and chary of my utterance.                                35
12251,SCENE IV,But being conscious of the innocence
12252,SCENE IV,"Of my intent, my uncorrupted will,"
12253,SCENE IV,"I gave way to my humours, to my passion:"
12254,SCENE IV,"Bold were my words, because my deeds were not."
12255,SCENE IV,"Now every planless measure, chance event,                           40"
12256,SCENE IV,"The threat of rage, the vaunt of joy and triumph,"
12257,SCENE IV,"And all the May-games of a heart o'erflowing,"
12258,SCENE IV,"Will they connect, and weave them all together"
12259,SCENE IV,"Into one web of treason; all will be plan,"
12260,SCENE IV,"My eye ne'er absent from the far-off mark,                          45"
12261,SCENE IV,"Step tracing step, each step a politic progress;"
12262,SCENE IV,And out of all they'll fabricate a charge
12263,SCENE IV,"So specious, that I must myself stand dumb."
12264,SCENE IV,"I am caught in my own net, and only force,"
12265,SCENE IV,Naught but a sudden rent can liberate me.                           50
12266,SCENE IV,How else! since that the heart's unbiass'd instinct
12267,SCENE IV,"Impelled me to the daring deed, which now"
12268,SCENE IV,"Necessity, self-preservation, orders."
12269,SCENE IV,"Stern is the On-look of Necessity,"
12270,SCENE IV,Not without shudder many a human hand                               55
12271,SCENE IV,Grasps the mysterious urn of destiny.
12272,SCENE IV,"My deed was mine, remaining in my bosom,"
12273,SCENE IV,Once suffered to escape from its safe corner
12274,SCENE IV,"Within the heart, its nursery and birthplace,"
12275,SCENE IV,"Sent forth into the Foreign, it belongs                             60"
12276,SCENE IV,For ever to those sly malicious powers
12277,SCENE IV,Whom never art of man conciliated.
12278,SCENE IV,What is thy enterprize? thy aim? thy object?
12279,SCENE IV,Hast honestly confessed it to thyself?
12280,SCENE IV,"Power seated on a quiet throne thou'dst shake,                      65"
12281,SCENE IV,"Power on an ancient consecrated throne,"
12282,SCENE IV,"Strong in possession, founded in old custom;"
12283,SCENE IV,Power by a thousand tough and stringy roots
12284,SCENE IV,Fixed to the people's pious nursery-faith.
12285,SCENE IV,"This, this will be no strife of strength with strength.             70"
12286,SCENE IV,"That feared I not. I brave each combatant,"
12287,SCENE IV,"Whom I can look on, fixing eye to eye,"
12288,SCENE IV,Who full himself of courage kindles courage
12289,SCENE IV,"In me too. 'Tis a foe invisible,"
12290,SCENE IV,"The which I fear--a fearful enemy,                                  75"
12291,SCENE IV,"Which in the human heart opposes me,"
12292,SCENE IV,By its coward fear alone made fearful to me.
12293,SCENE IV,"Not that, which full of life, instinct with power,"
12294,SCENE IV,"Makes known its present being, that is not"
12295,SCENE IV,"The true, the perilously formidable.                                80"
12296,SCENE IV,"O no! it is the common, the quite common,"
12297,SCENE IV,"The thing of an eternal yesterday,"
12298,SCENE IV,"What ever was, and evermore returns,"
12299,SCENE IV,"Sterling to-morrow, for to-day 'twas sterling!"
12300,SCENE IV,"For of the wholly common is man made,                               85"
12301,SCENE IV,"And custom is his nurse! Woe then to them,"
12302,SCENE IV,Who lay irreverent hands upon his old
12303,SCENE IV,"House furniture, the dear inheritance"
12304,SCENE IV,From his forefathers. For time consecrates;
12305,SCENE IV,And what is grey with age becomes religion.                         90
12306,SCENE IV,"Be in possession, and thou hast the right,"
12307,SCENE IV,And sacred will the many guard it for thee!

12317,SCENE IV,Not o'er this threshold yet--so slender is                          95

12351,SCENE V,
12352,SCENE V,_WALLENSTEIN and WRANGEL._
12353,SCENE V,
12354,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._ Your name is Wrangel?
12355,SCENE V,
12356,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._                           Gustave Wrangel, General"
12357,SCENE V,Of the Sudermanian Blues.
12358,SCENE V,
12359,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._            It was a Wrangel
12360,SCENE V,"Who injured me materially at Stralsund,"
12361,SCENE V,And by his brave resistance was the cause
12362,SCENE V,Of the opposition which that sea-port made.                          5
12363,SCENE V,
12364,SCENE V,_Wrangel._ It was the doing of the element
12365,SCENE V,"With which you fought, my Lord! and not my merit."
12366,SCENE V,"The Baltic Neptune did assert his freedom,"
12367,SCENE V,"The sea and land, it seemed, were not to serve"
12368,SCENE V,One and the same.
12369,SCENE V,
12370,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein (makes a motion for him to take a seat, and seats"
12371,SCENE V,himself)._ And where are your credentials?                      10
12372,SCENE V,"Come you provided with full powers, Sir General?"
12373,SCENE V,
12374,SCENE V,_Wrangel._ There are so many scruples yet to solve----
12375,SCENE V,
12376,SCENE V,_Wallenstein (having read the credentials)._ An able
12377,SCENE V,"letter!--Ay--he is a prudent,"
12378,SCENE V,"Intelligent master, whom you serve, Sir General!"
12379,SCENE V,"The Chancellor writes me, that he but fulfils                       15"
12380,SCENE V,His late departed Sovereign's own idea
12381,SCENE V,In helping me to the Bohemian crown.
12382,SCENE V,
12383,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._ He says the truth. Our great King, now in heaven,"
12384,SCENE V,Did ever deem most highly of your Grace's
12385,SCENE V,Pre-eminent sense and military genius;                              20
12386,SCENE V,"And always the commanding Intellect,"
12387,SCENE V,"He said, should have command, and be the King."
12388,SCENE V,
12389,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._ Yes, he might say it safely.--General Wrangel,"
12390,SCENE V,
12391,SCENE V,[_Taking his hand._
12392,SCENE V,
12393,SCENE V,"Come, fair and open--Trust me, I was always"
12394,SCENE V,A Swede at heart. Ey! that did you experience                       25
12395,SCENE V,Both in Silesia and at Nuremburg;
12396,SCENE V,"I had you often in my power, and let you"
12397,SCENE V,Always slip out by some back door or other.
12398,SCENE V,"'Tis this for which the Court can ne'er forgive me,"
12399,SCENE V,Which drives me to this present step: and since                     30
12400,SCENE V,"Our interests so run in one direction,"
12401,SCENE V,E'en let us have a thorough confidence
12402,SCENE V,Each in the other.
12403,SCENE V,
12404,SCENE V,_Wrangel._         Confidence will come
12405,SCENE V,Has each but only first security.
12406,SCENE V,
12407,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._ The Chancellor still, I see, does not quite trust"
12408,SCENE V,me;                                                             35
12409,SCENE V,"And, I confess--the gain does not wholly lie"
12410,SCENE V,To my advantage--Without doubt he thinks
12411,SCENE V,"If I can play false with the Emperor,"
12412,SCENE V,"Who is my Sov'reign, I can do the like"
12413,SCENE V,"With the enemy, and that the one too were                           40"
12414,SCENE V,Sooner to be forgiven me than the other.
12415,SCENE V,"Is not this your opinion too, Sir General?"
12416,SCENE V,
12417,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._ I have here an office merely, no opinion."
12418,SCENE V,
12419,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._ The Emperor hath urged me to the uttermost.
12420,SCENE V,I can no longer honourably serve him.                               45
12421,SCENE V,"For my security, in self-defence,"
12422,SCENE V,"I take this hard step, which my conscience blames."
12423,SCENE V,
12424,SCENE V,_Wrangel._ That I believe. So far would no one go
12425,SCENE V,Who was not forced to it.                     [_After a pause._
12426,SCENE V,What may have impelled
12427,SCENE V,Your princely Highness in this wise to act                          50
12428,SCENE V,"Toward your Sovereign Lord and Emperor,"
12429,SCENE V,Beseems not us to expound or criticize.
12430,SCENE V,The Swede is fighting for his good old cause.
12431,SCENE V,"With his good sword and conscience. This concurrence,"
12432,SCENE V,"This opportunity, is in our favour,                                 55"
12433,SCENE V,And all advantages in war are lawful.
12434,SCENE V,We take what offers without questioning;
12435,SCENE V,And if all have its due and just proportions----
12436,SCENE V,
12437,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._ Of what then are ye doubting? Of my will?
12438,SCENE V,"Or of my power? I pledged me to the Chancellor,                     60"
12439,SCENE V,"Would he trust me with sixteen thousand men,"
12440,SCENE V,That I would instantly go over to them
12441,SCENE V,With eighteen thousand of the Emperor's troops.
12442,SCENE V,
12443,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._ Your Grace is known to be a mighty war-chief,"
12444,SCENE V,To be a second Attila and Pyrrhus.                                  65
12445,SCENE V,"'Tis talked of still with fresh astonishment,"
12446,SCENE V,"How some years past, beyond all human faith,"
12447,SCENE V,"You called an army forth, like a creation:"
12448,SCENE V,But yet----
12449,SCENE V,
12450,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._ But yet?
12451,SCENE V,
12452,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._              But still the Chancellor thinks,"
12453,SCENE V,It might yet be an easier thing from nothing                        70
12454,SCENE V,"To call forth sixty thousand men of battle,"
12455,SCENE V,Than to persuade one sixtieth part of them--
12456,SCENE V,
12457,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._ What now? Out with it, friend!"
12458,SCENE V,
12459,SCENE V,_Wrangel._                                    To break their oaths.
12460,SCENE V,
12461,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._ And he thinks so?--He judges like a Swede,"
12462,SCENE V,And like a Protestant. You Lutherans                                75
12463,SCENE V,Fight for your Bible. You are interested
12464,SCENE V,About the cause; and with your hearts you follow
12465,SCENE V,"Your banners.--Among you, whoe'er deserts"
12466,SCENE V,"To the enemy, hath broken covenant"
12467,SCENE V,With two Lords at one time.--We've no such fancies.                 80
12468,SCENE V,
12469,SCENE V,_Wrangel._ Great God in Heaven! Have then the people here
12470,SCENE V,"No house and home, no fire-side, no altar?"
12471,SCENE V,
12472,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._ I will explain that to you, how it stands--"
12473,SCENE V,"The Austrian has a country, ay, and loves it,"
12474,SCENE V,"And has good cause to love it--but this army,                       85"
12475,SCENE V,"That calls itself the Imperial, this that houses"
12476,SCENE V,"Here in Bohemia, this has none--no country;"
12477,SCENE V,"This is an outcast of all foreign lands,"
12478,SCENE V,"Unclaimed by town or tribe, to whom belongs"
12479,SCENE V,"Nothing, except the universal sun.                                  90"
12480,SCENE V,
12481,SCENE V,_Wrangel._ But then the Nobles and the Officers?
12482,SCENE V,"Such a desertion, such a felony,"
12483,SCENE V,"It is without example, my Lord Duke,"
12484,SCENE V,In the world's history.
12485,SCENE V,
12486,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._          They are all mine--
12487,SCENE V,Mine unconditionally--mine on all terms.                            95
12488,SCENE V,"Not me, your own eyes you must trust."
12489,SCENE V,
12490,SCENE V,[_He gives him the paper containing the written oath.
12491,SCENE V,"WRANGEL reads it through, and, having read it,"
12492,SCENE V,"lays it on the table, remaining silent._"
12493,SCENE V,
12494,SCENE V,So then?
12495,SCENE V,Now comprehend you?
12496,SCENE V,
12497,SCENE V,_Wrangel._          Comprehend who can!
12498,SCENE V,My Lord Duke; I will let the mask drop--yes!
12499,SCENE V,I've full powers for a final settlement.
12500,SCENE V,The Rhinegrave stands but four days' march from here               100
12501,SCENE V,"With fifteen thousand men, and only waits"
12502,SCENE V,For orders to proceed and join your army.
12503,SCENE V,"Those orders I give out, immediately"
12504,SCENE V,We're compromised.
12505,SCENE V,
12506,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._     What asks the Chancellor?
12507,SCENE V,
12508,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._ Twelve Regiments, every man a Swede--my head            105"
12509,SCENE V,The warranty--and all might prove at last
12510,SCENE V,Only false play----
12511,SCENE V,
12512,SCENE V,_Wallenstein (starting)._ Sir Swede!
12513,SCENE V,
12514,SCENE V,_Wrangel._                           Am therefore forced
12515,SCENE V,"T' insist thereon, that he do formally,"
12516,SCENE V,"Irrevocably break with the Emperor,"
12517,SCENE V,Else not a Swede is trusted to Duke Friedland.                     110
12518,SCENE V,
12519,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._ Come, brief and open! What is the demand?"
12520,SCENE V,
12521,SCENE V,_Wrangel._ That he forthwith disarm the Spanish regiments
12522,SCENE V,"Attached to the Emperor, that he seize Prague,"
12523,SCENE V,"And to the Swedes give up that city, with"
12524,SCENE V,The strong pass Egra.
12525,SCENE V,
12526,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._        That is much indeed!                         115
12527,SCENE V,Prague!--Egra's granted--But--but Prague!--'Twon't do.
12528,SCENE V,I give you every security
12529,SCENE V,Which you may ask of me in common reason--
12530,SCENE V,"But Prague--Bohemia--these, Sir General,"
12531,SCENE V,I can myself protect.
12532,SCENE V,
12533,SCENE V,_Wrangel._            We doubt it not.                             120
12534,SCENE V,But 'tis not the protection that is now
12535,SCENE V,"Our sole concern. We want security,"
12536,SCENE V,That we shall not expend our men and money
12537,SCENE V,All to no purpose.
12538,SCENE V,
12539,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._     'Tis but reasonable.
12540,SCENE V,
12541,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._ And till we are indemnified, so long                    125"
12542,SCENE V,Stays Prague in pledge.
12543,SCENE V,
12544,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._          Then trust you us so little?
12545,SCENE V,
12546,SCENE V,"_Wrangel (rising)._ The Swede, if he would treat well with the"
12547,SCENE V,"German,"
12548,SCENE V,Must keep a sharp look-out. We have been called
12549,SCENE V,"Over the Baltic, we have saved the empire"
12550,SCENE V,From ruin--with our best blood have we seal'd                      130
12551,SCENE V,"The liberty of faith, and gospel truth."
12552,SCENE V,But now already is the benefaction
12553,SCENE V,"No longer felt, the load alone is felt.----"
12554,SCENE V,"Ye look askance with evil eye upon us,"
12555,SCENE V,"As foreigners, intruders in the empire,                            135"
12556,SCENE V,"And would fain send us, with some paltry sum"
12557,SCENE V,"Of money, home again to our old forests."
12558,SCENE V,"No, no! my Lord Duke! no!--it never was"
12559,SCENE V,"For Judas' pay, for chinking gold and silver,"
12560,SCENE V,That we did leave our King by the Great Stone.[696:1]              140
12561,SCENE V,"No, not for gold and silver have there bled"
12562,SCENE V,So many of our Swedish Nobles--neither
12563,SCENE V,"Will we, with empty laurels for our payment,"
12564,SCENE V,Hoist sail for our own country. Citizens
12565,SCENE V,"Will we remain upon the soil, the which                            145"
12566,SCENE V,"Our Monarch conquered for himself, and died."
12567,SCENE V,
12568,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._ Help to keep down the common enemy,"
12569,SCENE V,And the fair border land must needs be yours.
12570,SCENE V,
12571,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._ But when the common enemy lies vanquished,"
12572,SCENE V,Who knits together our new friendship then?                        150
12573,SCENE V,"We know, Duke Friedland! though perhaps the Swede"
12574,SCENE V,"Ought not t' have known it, that you carry on"
12575,SCENE V,Secret negotiations with the Saxons.
12576,SCENE V,"Who is our warranty, that we are not"
12577,SCENE V,The sacrifices in those articles                                   155
12578,SCENE V,Which 'tis thought needful to conceal from us?
12579,SCENE V,
12580,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein (rises)._ Think you of something better, Gustave"
12581,SCENE V,Wrangel!
12582,SCENE V,Of Prague no more.
12583,SCENE V,
12584,SCENE V,_Wrangel._         Here my commission ends.
12585,SCENE V,
12586,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._ Surrender up to you my capital!
12587,SCENE V,"Far liever would I face about, and step                            160"
12588,SCENE V,Back to my Emperor.
12589,SCENE V,
12590,SCENE V,_Wrangel._          If time yet permits----
12591,SCENE V,
12592,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._ That lies with me, even now, at any hour."
12593,SCENE V,
12594,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._ Some days ago, perhaps. To-day, no longer,"
12595,SCENE V,No longer since Sesina is a prisoner.
12596,SCENE V,"My Lord Duke, hear me--We believe that you                         165"
12597,SCENE V,At present do mean honourably by us.
12598,SCENE V,Since yesterday we're sure of that--and now
12599,SCENE V,"This paper warrants for the troops, there's nothing"
12600,SCENE V,Stands in the way of our full confidence.
12601,SCENE V,Prague shall not part us. Hear! The Chancellor                     170
12602,SCENE V,"Contents himself with Albstadt, to your Grace"
12603,SCENE V,"He gives up Ratschin and the narrow side,"
12604,SCENE V,"But Egra above all must open to us,"
12605,SCENE V,Ere we can think of any junction.
12606,SCENE V,
12607,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._                    You,"
12608,SCENE V,"You therefore must I trust, and you not me?                        175"
12609,SCENE V,I will consider of your proposition.
12610,SCENE V,
12611,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._ I must entreat, that your consideration"
12612,SCENE V,Occupy not too long a time. Already
12613,SCENE V,"Has this negotiation, my Lord Duke!"
12614,SCENE V,Crept on into the second year. If nothing                          180
12615,SCENE V,"Is settled this time, will the Chancellor"
12616,SCENE V,Consider it as broken off for ever.
12617,SCENE V,
12618,SCENE V,"_Wallenstein._ Ye press me hard. A measure, such as this,"
12619,SCENE V,Ought to be thought of.
12620,SCENE V,
12621,SCENE V,"_Wrangel._              Ay! but think of this too,"
12622,SCENE V,That sudden action only can procure it                             185
12623,SCENE V,"Success--think first of this, your Highness.   [_Exit WRANGEL._"

12691,SCENE VI,
12692,SCENE VI,_Wallenstein._ As yet is nothing settled: and (well weighed)
12693,SCENE VI,I feel myself inclined to leave it so.
12694,SCENE VI,

12771,SCENE VII,Of the most urgent nature is his business.

12773,SCENE VII,_Wallenstein._ Who knows what he may bring us? I will hear him.     30
12774,SCENE VII,
12775,SCENE VII,"_Countess._ Urgent for him, no doubt; but thou mayest wait."
12776,SCENE VII,
12777,SCENE VII,_Wallenstein._ What is it?
12778,SCENE VII,
12779,SCENE VII,_Countess._                Thou shalt be informed hereafter.
12780,SCENE VII,First let the Swede and thee be compromised.   [_Exit_ Servant.
12781,SCENE VII,
12782,SCENE VII,_Wallenstein._ If there were yet a choice! if yet some milder
12783,SCENE VII,Way of escape were possible--I still                                35
12784,SCENE VII,"Will choose it, and avoid the last extreme."
12785,SCENE VII,
12786,SCENE VII,_Countess._ Desir'st thou nothing further? Such a way
12787,SCENE VII,Lies still before thee. Send this Wrangel off.
12788,SCENE VII,"Forget thou thy old hopes, cast far away"
12789,SCENE VII,All thy past life; determine to commence                            40
12790,SCENE VII,"A new one. Virtue hath her heroes too,"

12793,SCENE VII,"Take a full coffer with thee--say aloud,"
12794,SCENE VII,Thou did'st but wish to prove thy fealty;                           45
12795,SCENE VII,Thy whole intention but to dupe the Swede.
12796,SCENE VII,
12797,SCENE VII,_Illo._ For that too 'tis too late. They know too much.
12798,SCENE VII,He would but bear his own head to the block.
12799,SCENE VII,
12800,SCENE VII,_Countess._ I fear not that. They have not evidence

12802,SCENE VII,The avowal of an arbitrary power.
12803,SCENE VII,They'll let the Duke resign without disturbance.
12804,SCENE VII,I see how all will end. The King of Hungary
12805,SCENE VII,"Makes his appearance, and 'twill of itself"
12806,SCENE VII,"Be understood, that then the Duke retires.                          55"
12807,SCENE VII,There will not want a formal declaration.
12808,SCENE VII,The young King will administer the oath
12809,SCENE VII,To the whole army; and so all returns
12810,SCENE VII,To the old position. On some morrow morning
12811,SCENE VII,The Duke departs; and now 'tis stir and bustle                      60
12812,SCENE VII,"Within his castles. He will hunt, and build,"
12813,SCENE VII,Superintend his horses' pedigrees;
12814,SCENE VII,"Creates himself a court, gives golden keys,"
12815,SCENE VII,And introduceth strictest ceremony
12816,SCENE VII,"In fine proportions, and nice etiquette;                            65"
12817,SCENE VII,"Keeps open table with high cheer; in brief,"
12818,SCENE VII,Commenceth mighty King--in miniature.
12819,SCENE VII,"And while he prudently demeans himself,"
12820,SCENE VII,"And gives himself no actual importance,"
12821,SCENE VII,He will be let appear whate'er he likes;                            70
12822,SCENE VII,"And who dares doubt, that Friedland will appear"
12823,SCENE VII,A mighty Prince to his last dying hour?
12824,SCENE VII,"Well now, what then? Duke Friedland is as others,"
12825,SCENE VII,"A fire-new Noble, whom the war hath raised"
12826,SCENE VII,"To price and currency, a Jonah's Gourd,                             75"
12827,SCENE VII,"An over-night creation of court-favour,"
12828,SCENE VII,Which with an undistinguishable ease
12829,SCENE VII,Makes Baron or makes Prince.
12830,SCENE VII,
12831,SCENE VII,_Wallenstein._               Take her away.
12832,SCENE VII,Let in the young Count Piccolomini.
12833,SCENE VII,
12834,SCENE VII,_Countess._ Art thou in earnest? I entreat thee! Canst thou         80
12835,SCENE VII,"Consent to bear thyself to thy own grave,"
12836,SCENE VII,So ignominiously to be dried up?
12837,SCENE VII,"Thy life, that arrogated such a height"
12838,SCENE VII,"To end in such a nothing! To be nothing,"
12839,SCENE VII,"When one was always nothing, is an evil                             85"
12840,SCENE VII,"That asks no stretch of patience, a light evil,"
12841,SCENE VII,"But to become a nothing, having been----"

12850,SCENE VII,"Cease I to work, I am annihilated,                                  95"
12851,SCENE VII,"Dangers nor sacrifices will I shun,"
12852,SCENE VII,If so I may avoid the last extreme;
12853,SCENE VII,"But ere I sink down into nothingness,"
12854,SCENE VII,"Leave off so little, who began so great,"

12856,SCENE VII,"Poor wretches, whom a day creates and crumbles,"
12857,SCENE VII,This age and after-ages[701:1] speak my name

12863,SCENE VII,O let not Superstition's nightly goblins
12864,SCENE VII,Subdue thy clear bright spirit! Art thou bid

12869,SCENE VII,"Yet not a few, and for a meaner object,"
12870,SCENE VII,"Have ventured even this, ay, and performed it."

12872,SCENE VII,Thou art accused of treason--whether with                          115
12873,SCENE VII,Or without justice is not now the question--
12874,SCENE VII,Thou art lost if thou dost not avail thee quickly
12875,SCENE VII,Of the power which thou possessest--Friedland! Duke!
12876,SCENE VII,"Tell me, where lives that thing so meek and tame,"
12877,SCENE VII,That doth not all his living faculties                             120
12878,SCENE VII,Put forth in preservation of his life?
12879,SCENE VII,"What deed so daring, which necessity"
12880,SCENE VII,And desperation will not sanctify?
12881,SCENE VII,
12882,SCENE VII,_Wallenstein._ Once was this Ferdinand so gracious to me:
12883,SCENE VII,He loved me; he esteemed me; I was placed                          125
12884,SCENE VII,The nearest to his heart. Full many a time
12885,SCENE VII,"We like familiar friends, both at one table,"
12886,SCENE VII,Have banquetted together. He and I--
12887,SCENE VII,And the young kings themselves held me the bason
12888,SCENE VII,Wherewith to wash me--and is't come to this?                       130
12889,SCENE VII,
12890,SCENE VII,"_Countess._ So faithfully preserv'st thou each small favour,"
12891,SCENE VII,And hast no memory for contumelies?
12892,SCENE VII,"Must I remind thee, how at Regenspurg"
12893,SCENE VII,This man repaid thy faithful services?
12894,SCENE VII,All ranks and all conditions in the Empire                         135
12895,SCENE VII,"Thou hadst wronged, to make him great,--hadst loaded on thee,"
12896,SCENE VII,"On thee, the hate, the curse of the whole world."
12897,SCENE VII,"No friend existed for thee in all Germany,"
12898,SCENE VII,And why? because thou hadst existed only
12899,SCENE VII,For the Emperor. To the Emperor alone                              140
12900,SCENE VII,Clung Friedland in that storm which gathered round him
12901,SCENE VII,At Regenspurg in the Diet--and he dropped thee!
12902,SCENE VII,He let thee fall! He let thee fall a victim
12903,SCENE VII,"To the Bavarian, to that insolent!"
12904,SCENE VII,"Deposed, stript bare of all thy dignity                            145"
12905,SCENE VII,"And power, amid the taunting of thy foes,"
12906,SCENE VII,Thou wert let drop into obscurity.--
12907,SCENE VII,"Say not, the restoration of thy honour"
12908,SCENE VII,Hath made atonement for that first injustice.
12909,SCENE VII,"No honest good-will was it that replaced thee,                     150"
12910,SCENE VII,"The law of hard necessity replaced thee,"
12911,SCENE VII,"Which they had fain opposed, but that they could not."
12912,SCENE VII,
12913,SCENE VII,"_Wallenstein._ Not to their good wishes, that is certain,"
12914,SCENE VII,Nor yet to his affection I'm indebted
12915,SCENE VII,"For this high office; and if I abuse it,                           155"
12916,SCENE VII,I shall therein abuse no confidence.
12917,SCENE VII,
12918,SCENE VII,_Countess_. Affection! confidence!--They needed thee.
12919,SCENE VII,"Necessity, impetuous remonstrant!"
12920,SCENE VII,"Who not with empty names, or shews of proxy,"
12921,SCENE VII,"Is served, who'll have the thing and not the symbol,               160"
12922,SCENE VII,"Ever seeks out the greatest and the best,"
12923,SCENE VII,"And at the rudder places him, e'en though"
12924,SCENE VII,She had been forced to take him from the rabble--
12925,SCENE VII,"She, this Necessity, it was that placed thee"
12926,SCENE VII,"In this high office, it was she that gave thee                     165"
12927,SCENE VII,Thy letters patent of inauguration.
12928,SCENE VII,"For, to the uttermost moment that they can."
12929,SCENE VII,This race still help themselves at cheapest rate
12930,SCENE VII,"With slavish souls, with puppets! At the approach"
12931,SCENE VII,"Of extreme peril, when a hollow image                              170"
12932,SCENE VII,"Is found a hollow image and no more,"
12933,SCENE VII,Then falls the power into the mighty hands
12934,SCENE VII,"Of Nature, of the spirit giant-born,"
12935,SCENE VII,"Who listens only to himself, knows nothing"
12936,SCENE VII,"Of stipulations, duties, reverences                                175"
12937,SCENE VII,"And, like the emancipated force of fire,"
12938,SCENE VII,"Unmastered scorches, ere it reaches them,"
12939,SCENE VII,"Their fine-spun webs, their artificial policy."
12940,SCENE VII,
12941,SCENE VII,_Wallenstein._ 'Tis true! they saw me always as I am--
12942,SCENE VII,Always! I did not cheat them in the bargain.                       180
12943,SCENE VII,I never held it worth my pains to hide
12944,SCENE VII,The bold all-grasping habit of my soul.
12945,SCENE VII,
12946,SCENE VII,_Countess._ Nay rather--thou hast ever shewn thyself
12947,SCENE VII,"A formidable man, without restraint;"
12948,SCENE VII,Hast exercised the full prerogatives                               185
12949,SCENE VII,"Of thy impetuous nature, which had been"
12950,SCENE VII,"Once granted to thee. Therefore, Duke, not thou,"
12951,SCENE VII,"Who hast still remained consistent with thyself,"
12952,SCENE VII,"But they are in the wrong, who fearing thee,"
12953,SCENE VII,Entrusted such a power in hands they feared.                       190
12954,SCENE VII,"For, by the laws of Spirit, in the right"
12955,SCENE VII,Is every individual character
12956,SCENE VII,That acts in strict consistence with itself.
12957,SCENE VII,Self-contradiction is the only wrong.
12958,SCENE VII,"Wert thou another being, then, when thou                           195"
12959,SCENE VII,Eight years ago pursuedst thy march with fire
12960,SCENE VII,"And sword, and desolation, through the Circles"
12961,SCENE VII,"Of Germany, the universal scourge,"
12962,SCENE VII,"Didst mock all ordinances of the empire,"
12963,SCENE VII,"The fearful rights of strength alone exertedst,                    200"
12964,SCENE VII,"Trampledst to earth each rank, each magistracy,"
12965,SCENE VII,All to extend thy Sultan's domination?
12966,SCENE VII,"Then was the time to break thee in, to curb"
12967,SCENE VII,"Thy haughty will, to teach thee ordinance."
12968,SCENE VII,"But no! the Emperor felt no touch of conscience,                   205"
12969,SCENE VII,"What served him pleased him, and without a murmur"
12970,SCENE VII,He stamped his broad seal on these lawless deeds.
12971,SCENE VII,"What at that time was right, because thou didst it"
12972,SCENE VII,"For him, to-day is all at once become"
12973,SCENE VII,"Opprobrious, foul, because it is directed                          210"
12974,SCENE VII,Against him.--O most flimsy superstition!
12975,SCENE VII,
12976,SCENE VII,_Wallenstein (rising)._ I never saw it in this light before.
12977,SCENE VII,'Tis even so. The Emperor perpetrated
12978,SCENE VII,"Deeds through my arm, deeds most unorderly."
12979,SCENE VII,"And even this prince's mantle, which I wear,                       215"
12980,SCENE VII,"I owe to what were services to him,"
12981,SCENE VII,But most high misdemeanours 'gainst the empire.
12982,SCENE VII,
12983,SCENE VII,"_Countess._ Then betwixt thee and him (confess it, Friedland!)"
12984,SCENE VII,"The point can be no more of right and duty,"
12985,SCENE VII,Only of power and opportunity.                                     220
12986,SCENE VII,"That opportunity, lo! it comes yonder,"
12987,SCENE VII,Approaching with swift steeds; then with a swing
12988,SCENE VII,"Throw thyself up into the chariot-seat,"
12989,SCENE VII,"Seize with firm hand the reins, ere thy opponent"
12990,SCENE VII,"Anticipate thee, and himself make conquest                         225"
12991,SCENE VII,Of the now empty seat. The moment comes--
12992,SCENE VII,"It is already here, when thou must write"
12993,SCENE VII,The absolute total of thy life's vast sum.
12994,SCENE VII,"The constellations stand victorious o'er thee,"
12995,SCENE VII,"The planets shoot good fortune in fair junctions,                  230"
12996,SCENE VII,"And tell thee, 'Now's the time!' The starry courses"
12997,SCENE VII,Hast thou thy life long measured to no purpose?
12998,SCENE VII,"The quadrant and the circle, were they playthings?"
12999,SCENE VII,
13000,SCENE VII,[_Pointing to the different objects in the room._
13001,SCENE VII,
13002,SCENE VII,"The zodiacs, the rolling orbs of heaven,"
13003,SCENE VII,"Hast pictured on these walls, and all around thee                  235"
13004,SCENE VII,"In dumb, foreboding symbols hast thou placed"
13005,SCENE VII,These seven presiding Lords of Destiny--
13006,SCENE VII,For toys? Is all this preparation nothing?
13007,SCENE VII,"Is there no marrow in this hollow art,"
13008,SCENE VII,That even to thyself it doth avail                                 240
13009,SCENE VII,"Nothing, and has no influence over thee"
13010,SCENE VII,In the great moment of decision?----
13011,SCENE VII,
13012,SCENE VII,_Wallenstein (interrupting the Countess)._ Send Wrangel to me--I
13013,SCENE VII,will instantly
13014,SCENE VII,Dispatch three couriers----
13015,SCENE VII,
13016,SCENE VII,_Illo (hurrying out)._      God in heaven be praised!
13017,SCENE VII,
13018,SCENE VII,_Wallenstein._ It is his evil genius and mine.                     245
13019,SCENE VII,Our evil genius! It chastises him
13020,SCENE VII,"Through me, the instrument of his ambition;"
13021,SCENE VII,"And I expect no less, than that Revenge"
13022,SCENE VII,E'en now is whetting for my breast the poniard.
13023,SCENE VII,"Who sows the serpent's teeth, let him not hope                     250"
13024,SCENE VII,To reap a joyous harvest. Every crime
13025,SCENE VII,"Has, in the moment of its perpetration,"
13026,SCENE VII,"Its own avenging angel--dark misgiving,"
13027,SCENE VII,An ominous sinking at the inmost heart.
13028,SCENE VII,He can no longer trust me--Then no longer                          255
13029,SCENE VII,Can I retreat--so come that which must come.--
13030,SCENE VII,"Still destiny preserves its due relations,"
13031,SCENE VII,The heart within us is its absolute
13032,SCENE VII,Vicegerent.                                      [_To TERTSKY._
13033,SCENE VII,"Go, conduct you Gustave Wrangel"
13034,SCENE VII,To my state-cabinet. Myself will speak to                          260
13035,SCENE VII,The couriers.--And dispatch immediately
13036,SCENE VII,A servant for Octavio Piccolomini.          [_To the COUNTESS._
13037,SCENE VII,"No exultation--woman, triumph not!"
13038,SCENE VII,For jealous are the Powers of Destiny.
13039,SCENE VII,"Joy premature, and shouts ere victory,                             265"
13040,SCENE VII,Incroach upon their rights and privileges.

13667,SCENE IV,Bear witness for me that I never said so.
13668,SCENE IV,
13669,SCENE IV,_Octavio._ And you renounce the Duke then?
13670,SCENE IV,
13671,SCENE IV,_Isolani._                                 If he's planning

13679,SCENE IV,_Octavio._ I am rejoiced that you're so well disposed.

13681,SCENE IV,With all the light-armed troops--it must appear                     65
13682,SCENE IV,As came the order from the Duke himself.
13683,SCENE IV,At Frauenberg's the place of rendezvous;
13684,SCENE IV,There will Count Galas give you further orders.
13685,SCENE IV,
13686,SCENE IV,_Isolani._ It shall be done. But you'll remember me

13688,SCENE IV,
13689,SCENE IV,_Octavio._ I will not fail to mention it honourably.

13701,SCENE IV,"_Isolani._ I am a merry lad, and if at time"

14077,SCENE VI,
14078,SCENE VI,_Max._ No Emperor has power to prescribe
14079,SCENE VI,Laws to the heart; and would'st thou wish to rob me                 45
14080,SCENE VI,"Of the sole blessing which my fate has left me,"
14081,SCENE VI,Her sympathy? Must then a cruel deed
14082,SCENE VI,Be done with cruelty? The unalterable
14083,SCENE VI,"Shall I perform ignobly--steal away,"
14084,SCENE VI,With stealthy coward flight forsake her? No!                        50

14091,SCENE VI,"Of comfort, plaining, loose this pang of death!"

14098,SCENE VI,

14100,SCENE VI,If thou--my son--my own blood--(dare I think it?)
14101,SCENE VI,"Do sell thyself to him, the infamous,"
14102,SCENE VI,"Do stamp this brand upon our noble house,                           65"
14103,SCENE VI,"Then shall the world behold the horrible deed,"
14104,SCENE VI,And in unnatural combat shall the steel
14105,SCENE VI,Of the son trickle with the father's blood.
14106,SCENE VI,
14107,SCENE VI,"_Max._ O hadst thou always better thought of men,"
14108,SCENE VI,Thou hadst then acted better. Curst suspicion!                      70
14109,SCENE VI,Unholy miserable doubt! To him
14110,SCENE VI,"Nothing on earth remains unwrenched and firm,"
14111,SCENE VI,Who has no faith.
14112,SCENE VI,
14113,SCENE VI,"_Octavio._        And if I trust thy heart,"
14114,SCENE VI,Will it be always in thy power to follow it?
14115,SCENE VI,
14116,SCENE VI,_Max._ The heart's voice thou hast not o'erpower'd--as little       75
14117,SCENE VI,Will Wallenstein be able to o'erpower it.
14118,SCENE VI,
14119,SCENE VI,"_Octavio._ O, Max! I see thee never more again!"
14120,SCENE VI,
14121,SCENE VI,_Max._ Unworthy of thee wilt thou never see me.
14122,SCENE VI,
14123,SCENE VI,_Octavio._ I go to Frauenberg--the Pappenheimers
14124,SCENE VI,"I leave thee here, the Lothrings too; Toskana                       80"
14125,SCENE VI,And Tiefenbach remain here to protect thee.
14126,SCENE VI,"They love thee, and are faithful to their oath,"
14127,SCENE VI,And will far rather fall in gallant contest
14128,SCENE VI,"Than leave their rightful leader, and their honour."
14129,SCENE VI,
14130,SCENE VI,"_Max._ Rely on this, I either leave my life                         85"
14131,SCENE VI,"In the struggle, or conduct them out of Pilsen."
14132,SCENE VI,
14133,SCENE VI,"_Octavio._ Farewell, my son!"
14134,SCENE VI,
14135,SCENE VI,_Max._                       Farewell!
14136,SCENE VI,
14137,SCENE VI,_Octavio._                             How? not one look
14138,SCENE VI,Of filial love? No grasp of the hand at parting?
14139,SCENE VI,"It is a bloody war, to which we are going,"
14140,SCENE VI,And the event uncertain and in darkness.                            90
14141,SCENE VI,So used we not to part--it was not so!
14142,SCENE VI,Is it then true? I have a son no longer?

14192,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"The two Dramas, PICCOLOMINI, or the first part of"
14193,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"WALLENSTEIN, and WALLENSTEIN, are introduced in the original"
14194,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"manuscript by a Prelude in one Act, entitled WALLENSTEIN'S"
14195,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"CAMP. This is written in rhyme, and in nine-syllable verse, in"
14196,TO THE FIRST EDITION,the same _lilting_ metre (if that expression may be permitted)       5
14197,TO THE FIRST EDITION,with the second Eclogue of Spenser's Shepherd's Calendar.
14198,TO THE FIRST EDITION,
14199,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"This Prelude possesses a sort of broad humour, and is not"
14200,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"deficient in character; but to have translated it into prose, or"
14201,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"into any other metre than that of the original, would have"
14202,TO THE FIRST EDITION,given a false notion both of its style and purport; to have         10
14203,TO THE FIRST EDITION,translated it into the same metre would have been incompatible with
14204,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"a faithful adherence to the sense of the German, from the"
14205,TO THE FIRST EDITION,comparative poverty of our language in rhymes; and it would have
14206,TO THE FIRST EDITION,been unadvisable from the incongruity of those lax verses with
14207,TO THE FIRST EDITION,the present taste of the English Public. Schiller's intention       15
14208,TO THE FIRST EDITION,seems to have been merely to have prepared his reader for the
14209,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"Tragedies by a lively picture of the laxity of discipline, and the"
14210,TO THE FIRST EDITION,mutinous dispositions of Wallenstein's soldiery. It is not
14211,TO THE FIRST EDITION,necessary as a preliminary explanation. For these reasons it
14212,TO THE FIRST EDITION,has been thought expedient not to translate it.                     20
14213,TO THE FIRST EDITION,
14214,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"The admirers of Schiller, who have abstracted their conception"
14215,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"of that author from the _Robbers_, and the _Cabal_ and _Love_, plays"
14216,TO THE FIRST EDITION,in which the main interest is produced by the excitement of
14217,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"curiosity, and in which the curiosity is excited by terrible and"
14218,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"extraordinary incident, will not have perused without some          25"
14219,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"portion of disappointment the Dramas, which it has been my"
14220,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"employment to translate. They should, however, reflect that"
14221,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"these are Historical Dramas, taken from a popular German"
14222,TO THE FIRST EDITION,History; that we must therefore judge of them in some measure
14223,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"with the feelings of Germans; or by analogy, with the interest      30"
14224,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"excited in us by similar Dramas in our own language. Few,"
14225,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"I trust, would be rash or ignorant enough to compare Schiller"
14226,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"with Shakspeare yet, merely as illustration, I would say"
14227,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"that we should proceed to the perusal of Wallenstein, not"
14228,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"from Lear or Othello, but from Richard the Second, or the           35"
14229,TO THE FIRST EDITION,three parts of Henry the Sixth. We scarcely expect rapidity
14230,TO THE FIRST EDITION,in an Historical Drama; and many prolix speeches are
14231,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"pardoned from characters, whose names and actions have"
14232,TO THE FIRST EDITION,formed the most amusing tales of our early life. On the other
14233,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"hand, there exist in these plays more individual beauties,          40"
14234,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"more passages the excellence of which will bear reflection,"
14235,TO THE FIRST EDITION,than in the former productions of Schiller. The description of
14236,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"the Astrological Tower, and the reflections of the Young Lover,"
14237,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"which follow it, form in the original a fine poem; and my"
14238,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"translation must have been wretched indeed, if it can have          45"
14239,TO THE FIRST EDITION,wholly overclouded the beauties of the Scene in the first Act of
14240,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"the first Play between Questenberg, Max, and Octavio Piccolomini."
14241,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"If we except the Scene of the setting sun in the _Robbers_,"
14242,TO THE FIRST EDITION,I know of no part in Schiller's Plays which equals the whole
14243,TO THE FIRST EDITION,of the first Scene of the fifth Act of the concluding Play. It      50
14244,TO THE FIRST EDITION,would be unbecoming in me to be more diffuse on this subject.
14245,TO THE FIRST EDITION,A Translator stands connected with the original Author by
14246,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"a certain law of subordination, which makes it more decorous"
14247,TO THE FIRST EDITION,to point out excellencies than defects: indeed he is not likely
14248,TO THE FIRST EDITION,to be a fair judge of either. The pleasure or disgust from his      55
14249,TO THE FIRST EDITION,own labour will mingle with the feelings that arise from an
14250,TO THE FIRST EDITION,afterview of the original. Even in the first perusal of a work
14251,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"in any foreign language which we understand, we are apt to"
14252,TO THE FIRST EDITION,attribute to it more excellence than it really possesses from our
14253,TO THE FIRST EDITION,own pleasurable sense of difficulty overcome without effect.        60
14254,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"Translation of poetry into poetry is difficult, because the"
14255,TO THE FIRST EDITION,Translator must give a brilliancy to his language without that warmth
14256,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"of original conception, from which such brilliancy would follow"
14257,TO THE FIRST EDITION,of its own accord. But the translator of a living Author is
14258,TO THE FIRST EDITION,encumbered with additional inconveniences. If he render his         65
14259,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"original faithfully, as to the sense of each passage, he must"
14260,TO THE FIRST EDITION,necessarily destroy a considerable portion of the spirit; if he
14261,TO THE FIRST EDITION,endeavour to give a work executed according to laws of
14262,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"compensation, he subjects himself to imputations of vanity, or"
14263,TO THE FIRST EDITION,misrepresentation. I have thought it my duty to remain              70
14264,TO THE FIRST EDITION,"bound by the sense of my original, with as few exceptions as"
14265,TO THE FIRST EDITION,the nature of the languages rendered possible.

14335,SCENE I,_Countess (watching them from the opposite side)._ So you have
14336,SCENE I,"nothing, niece, to ask me? Nothing?"
14337,SCENE I,I have been waiting for a word from you.
14338,SCENE I,And could you then endure in all this time

14346,SCENE I,"Confess it to me, Thekla! have you seen him?"

14348,SCENE I,_Thekla._ To-day and yesterday I have not seen him.
14349,SCENE I,
14350,SCENE I,"_Countess._ And not heard from him either? Come, be open!"
14351,SCENE I,
14352,SCENE I,_Thekla._ No syllable.

14376,SCENE II,
14377,SCENE II,_Countess._                     He now knows all.
14378,SCENE II,'Twere now the moment to declare himself.
14379,SCENE II,
14380,SCENE II,"_Thekla._ If I'm to understand you, speak less darkly.               5"
14381,SCENE II,
14382,SCENE II,_Countess._ 'Twas for that purpose that I bade her leave us.
14383,SCENE II,"Thekla, you are no more a child. Your heart"
14384,SCENE II,"Is now no more in nonage: for you love,"
14385,SCENE II,And boldness dwells with love--that you have proved.
14386,SCENE II,Your nature moulds itself upon your father's                        10
14387,SCENE II,More than your mother's spirit. Therefore may you
14388,SCENE II,"Hear, what were too much for her fortitude."
14389,SCENE II,
14390,SCENE II,"_Thekla._ Enough! no further preface, I entreat you."
14391,SCENE II,"At once, out with it! Be it what it may,"
14392,SCENE II,It is not possible that it should torture me                        15
14393,SCENE II,More than this introduction. What have you
14394,SCENE II,To say to me? Tell me the whole and briefly!
14395,SCENE II,
14396,SCENE II,_Countess._ You'll not be frightened--
14397,SCENE II,
14398,SCENE II,"_Thekla._                              Name it, I entreat you."
14399,SCENE II,
14400,SCENE II,_Countess._ It lies within your power to do your father
14401,SCENE II,A weighty service--
14402,SCENE II,
14403,SCENE II,_Thekla._           Lies within my power?                           20
14404,SCENE II,
14405,SCENE II,_Countess._ Max Piccolomini loves you. You can link him
14406,SCENE II,Indissolubly to your father.
14407,SCENE II,
14408,SCENE II,_Thekla._                    I?
14409,SCENE II,What need of me for that? And is he not
14410,SCENE II,Already linked to him?
14411,SCENE II,
14412,SCENE II,_Countess._            He was.
14413,SCENE II,
14414,SCENE II,_Thekla._                      And wherefore
14415,SCENE II,Should he not be so now--not be so always?                          25
14416,SCENE II,
14417,SCENE II,_Countess._ He cleaves to the Emperor too.
14418,SCENE II,
14419,SCENE II,_Thekla._                                  Not more than duty
14420,SCENE II,And honour may demand of him.
14421,SCENE II,
14422,SCENE II,_Countess._                   We ask
14423,SCENE II,"Proofs of his love, and not proofs of his honour."
14424,SCENE II,Duty and honour!
14425,SCENE II,Those are ambiguous words with many meanings.                       30
14426,SCENE II,You should interpret them for him: his love
14427,SCENE II,Should be the sole definer of his honour.
14428,SCENE II,
14429,SCENE II,_Thekla._ How?
14430,SCENE II,
14431,SCENE II,_Countess._    The Emperor or you must he renounce.
14432,SCENE II,
14433,SCENE II,_Thekla._ He will accompany my father gladly
14434,SCENE II,"In his retirement. From himself you heard,                          35"
14435,SCENE II,How much he wished to lay aside the sword.
14436,SCENE II,
14437,SCENE II,"_Countess._ He must not lay the sword aside, we mean;"
14438,SCENE II,He must unsheath it in your father's cause.
14439,SCENE II,
14440,SCENE II,_Thekla._ He'll spend with gladness and alacrity
14441,SCENE II,"His life, his heart's blood in my father's cause,                   40"
14442,SCENE II,If shame or injury be intended him.
14443,SCENE II,
14444,SCENE II,"_Countess._ You will not understand me. Well, hear then!"
14445,SCENE II,"Your father has fallen off from the Emperor,"
14446,SCENE II,And is about to join the enemy
14447,SCENE II,With the whole soldiery--
14448,SCENE II,
14449,SCENE II,"_Thekla._                 Alas, my mother!                          45"
14450,SCENE II,
14451,SCENE II,_Countess._ There needs a great example to draw on
14452,SCENE II,The army after him. The Piccolomini
14453,SCENE II,Possess the love and reverence of the troops;
14454,SCENE II,"They govern all opinions, and wherever"
14455,SCENE II,"They lead the way, none hesitate to follow.                         50"
14456,SCENE II,The son secures the father to our interests--
14457,SCENE II,You've much in your hands at this moment.
14458,SCENE II,
14459,SCENE II,"_Thekla._                                 Ah,"
14460,SCENE II,My miserable mother! what a death-stroke
14461,SCENE II,Awaits thee!--No! She never will survive it.
14462,SCENE II,
14463,SCENE II,_Countess._ She will accommodate her soul to that                   55
14464,SCENE II,Which is and must be. I do know your mother.
14465,SCENE II,The far-off future weights upon her heart
14466,SCENE II,With torture of anxiety; but is it
14467,SCENE II,"Unalterably, actually present,"
14468,SCENE II,"She soon resigns herself, and bears it calmly.                      60"
14469,SCENE II,
14470,SCENE II,"_Thekla._ O my fore-boding bosom! Even now,"
14471,SCENE II,"E'en now 'tis here, that icy hand of horror!"
14472,SCENE II,And my young hope lies shuddering in its grasp;
14473,SCENE II,"I knew it well--no sooner had I entered,"
14474,SCENE II,A heavy ominous presentiment                                        65
14475,SCENE II,"Revealed to me, that spirits of death were hovering"
14476,SCENE II,Over my happy fortune. But why think I
14477,SCENE II,First of myself? My mother! O my mother!
14478,SCENE II,
14479,SCENE II,_Countess._ Calm yourself! Break not out in vain lamenting!
14480,SCENE II,"Preserve you for your father the firm friend,                       70"
14481,SCENE II,"And for yourself the lover, all will yet"
14482,SCENE II,Prove good and fortunate.
14483,SCENE II,
14484,SCENE II,_Thekla._                 Prove good? What good?
14485,SCENE II,Must we not part? Part ne'er to meet again?
14486,SCENE II,
14487,SCENE II,_Countess._ He parts not from you! He can not part from you.
14488,SCENE II,
14489,SCENE II,_Thekla._ Alas for his sore anguish! It will rend                   75
14490,SCENE II,His heart asunder.
14491,SCENE II,
14492,SCENE II,"_Countess._        If indeed he loves you,"
14493,SCENE II,His resolution will be speedily taken.
14494,SCENE II,
14495,SCENE II,_Thekla._ His resolution will be speedily taken--
14496,SCENE II,O do not doubt of that! A resolution!
14497,SCENE II,Does there remain one to be taken?
14498,SCENE II,
14499,SCENE II,_Countess._                        Hush!                            80
14500,SCENE II,Collect yourself! I hear your mother coming.
14501,SCENE II,

15233,SCENE X,
15234,SCENE X,_Butler._ My General: I come--
15235,SCENE X,
15236,SCENE X,_Wallenstein (leaning on Butler's shoulders)._ Know'st thou
15237,SCENE X,already?
15238,SCENE X,That old man has betrayed me to the Emperor.
15239,SCENE X,What say'st thou? Thirty years have we together
15240,SCENE X,"Lived out, and held out, sharing joy and hardship."
15241,SCENE X,"We have slept in one camp-bed, drunk from one glass,                10"
15242,SCENE X,"One morsel shared! I leaned myself on him,"
15243,SCENE X,As now I lean me on thy faithful shoulder.
15244,SCENE X,"And now in the very moment, when, all love,"
15245,SCENE X,"All confidence, my bosom beat to his,"
15246,SCENE X,"He sees and takes the advantage, stabs the knife                    15"

15250,SCENE X,What is your present purpose?
15251,SCENE X,
15252,SCENE X,_Wallenstein._                Well remembered!
15253,SCENE X,"Courage my soul! I am still rich in friends,"
15254,SCENE X,"Still loved by Destiny; for in the moment,"
15255,SCENE X,"That it unmasks the plotting hypocrite,                             20"
15256,SCENE X,It sends and proves to me one faithful heart.
15257,SCENE X,"Of the hypocrite no more! Think not, his loss"
15258,SCENE X,Was that which struck the pang: O no! his treason

15260,SCENE X,"Dear to my heart, and honoured were they both,                      25"

15284,SCENE X,
15285,SCENE X,_Butler._ From what that larum in the camp arose?
15286,SCENE X,
15287,SCENE X,_Wallenstein._ From what?
15288,SCENE X,
15289,SCENE X,_Butler._                 That Courier.
15290,SCENE X,
15291,SCENE X,_Wallenstein._                          Well?
15292,SCENE X,

15300,SCENE X,
15301,SCENE X,_Wallenstein._ And I not know it?

15304,SCENE X,In custody.
15305,SCENE X,
15306,SCENE X,_Illo._     Damnation!
15307,SCENE X,
15308,SCENE X,_Butler._              And his letter
15309,SCENE X,"Was broken open, and is circulated"
15310,SCENE X,Through the whole camp.
15311,SCENE X,
15312,SCENE X,_Wallenstein._          You know what it contains?
15313,SCENE X,
15314,SCENE X,_Butler._ Question me not.
15315,SCENE X,
15316,SCENE X,_Tertsky._                 Illo! alas for us.                       45
15317,SCENE X,
15318,SCENE X,_Wallenstein._ Hide nothing from me--I can hear the worst.
15319,SCENE X,Prague then is lost. It is. Confess it freely.
15320,SCENE X,
15321,SCENE X,_Butler._ Yes! Prague is lost. And all the several regiments
15322,SCENE X,"At Budweiss, Tabor, Brannau, Konigingratz,"
15323,SCENE X,"At Brun and Znaym, have forsaken you,                               50"

15544,SCENE III,
15545,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ What reward hadst thou for this gallant exploit?
15546,SCENE III,
15547,SCENE III,_Anspessade._ That which I asked for: the honour to serve
15548,SCENE III,in this corps.                                                      10
15549,SCENE III,
15550,SCENE III,_Wallenstein (turning to a second)._ Thou wert among the
15551,SCENE III,volunteers that seized and made booty of the Swedish battery
15552,SCENE III,at Altenburg.
15553,SCENE III,
15554,SCENE III,"_Second Cuirassier._ Yes, General!"
15555,SCENE III,
15556,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ I forget no one with whom I have exchanged           15
15557,SCENE III,words. (_A pause_). Who sends you?
15558,SCENE III,
15559,SCENE III,"_Anspessade._ Your noble regiment, the Cuirassiers of"
15560,SCENE III,Piccolomini.
15561,SCENE III,
15562,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Why does not your colonel deliver in your
15563,SCENE III,"request, according to the custom of service?                        20"
15564,SCENE III,
15565,SCENE III,_Anspessade._ Because we would first know whom we serve.
15566,SCENE III,
15567,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Begin your address.
15568,SCENE III,
15569,SCENE III,_Anspessade (giving the word of command)._ Shoulder your arms!
15570,SCENE III,
15571,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein (turning to a third)._ Thy name is Risbeck, Cologne"
15572,SCENE III,is thy birthplace.                                                  25
15573,SCENE III,
15574,SCENE III,_Third Cuirassier._ Risbeck of Cologne.
15575,SCENE III,
15576,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ It was thou that broughtest in the Swedish
15577,SCENE III,"colonel, Diebald, prisoner, in the camp at Nuremberg."
15578,SCENE III,
15579,SCENE III,"_Third Cuirassier._ It was not I, General!"
15580,SCENE III,
15581,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Perfectly right! It was thy elder brother:           30
15582,SCENE III,thou hadst a younger brother too: Where did he stay?
15583,SCENE III,
15584,SCENE III,_Third Cuirassier._ He is stationed at Olmutz with the
15585,SCENE III,Imperial army.
15586,SCENE III,
15587,SCENE III,_Wallenstein (to the Anspessade)._ Now then--begin.
15588,SCENE III,
15589,SCENE III,_Anspessade._ There came to hand a letter from the Emperor          35
15590,SCENE III,Commanding us----
15591,SCENE III,
15592,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._    Who chose you?
15593,SCENE III,
15594,SCENE III,_Anspessade._                    Every company
15595,SCENE III,Drew its own man by lot.
15596,SCENE III,
15597,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._           Now! to the business.
15598,SCENE III,
15599,SCENE III,_Anspessade._ There came to hand a letter from the Emperor
15600,SCENE III,"Commanding us collectively, from thee"
15601,SCENE III,"All duties of obedience to withdraw,                                40"
15602,SCENE III,Because thou wert an enemy and traitor.
15603,SCENE III,
15604,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ And what did you determine?
15605,SCENE III,
15606,SCENE III,_Anspessade._                              All our comrades
15607,SCENE III,"At Brannau, Budweiss, Prague and Olmutz, have"
15608,SCENE III,"Obeyed already, and the regiments here,                             45"
15609,SCENE III,"Tiefenbach and Toscana, instantly"
15610,SCENE III,Did follow their example. But--but we
15611,SCENE III,Do not believe that thou art an enemy
15612,SCENE III,"And traitor to thy country, hold it merely"
15613,SCENE III,"For lie and trick, and a trumped-up Spanish story!                  50"
15614,SCENE III,"Thyself shalt tell us what thy purpose is,"
15615,SCENE III,For we have found thee still sincere and true:
15616,SCENE III,No mouth shall interpose itself betwixt
15617,SCENE III,The gallant General and the gallant troops.
15618,SCENE III,
15619,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Therein I recognize my Pappenheimers.                55
15620,SCENE III,
15621,SCENE III,_Anspessade._ And this proposal makes thy regiment to thee:
15622,SCENE III,Is it thy purpose merely to preserve
15623,SCENE III,"In thy own hands this military sceptre,"
15624,SCENE III,"Which so becomes thee, which the Emperor"
15625,SCENE III,Made over to thee by a covenant?                                    60
15626,SCENE III,Is it thy purpose merely to remain
15627,SCENE III,Supreme commander of the Austrian armies?--
15628,SCENE III,"We will stand by thee, General! and guarantee"
15629,SCENE III,Thy honest rights against all opposition.
15630,SCENE III,"And should it chance, that all the other regiments                  65"
15631,SCENE III,"Turn from thee, by ourselves will we stand forth"
15632,SCENE III,"Thy faithful soldiers, and, as is our duty,"
15633,SCENE III,"Far rather let ourselves be cut to pieces,"
15634,SCENE III,Than suffer thee to fall. But if it be
15635,SCENE III,"As the Emperor's letter says, if it be true,                        70"
15636,SCENE III,That thou in traitorous wise wilt lead us over
15637,SCENE III,"To the enemy, which God in heaven forbid!"
15638,SCENE III,"Then we too will forsake thee, and obey"
15639,SCENE III,That letter----
15640,SCENE III,
15641,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein._  Hear me, children!"
15642,SCENE III,
15643,SCENE III,"_Anspessade._                      Yes, or no!"
15644,SCENE III,There needs no other answer.
15645,SCENE III,
15646,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._               Yield attention.                       75
15647,SCENE III,"You're men of sense, examine for yourselves;"
15648,SCENE III,"Ye think, and do not follow with the herd:"
15649,SCENE III,And therefore have I always shewn you honour
15650,SCENE III,"Above all others, suffered you to reason;"
15651,SCENE III,"Have treated you as free men, and my orders                         80"
15652,SCENE III,Were but the echoes of your prior suffrage.--
15653,SCENE III,
15654,SCENE III,_Anspessade._ Most fair and noble has thy conduct been
15655,SCENE III,"To us, my General! With thy confidence"
15656,SCENE III,"Thou hast honoured us, and shewn us grace and favour"
15657,SCENE III,Beyond all other regiments; and thou seest                          85
15658,SCENE III,We follow not the common herd. We will
15659,SCENE III,Stand by thee faithfully. Speak but one word--
15660,SCENE III,"Thy word shall satisfy us, that it is not"
15661,SCENE III,A treason which thou meditatest--that
15662,SCENE III,Thou meanest not to lead the army over                              90
15663,SCENE III,To the enemy; nor e'er betray thy country.
15664,SCENE III,
15665,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein._ Me, me are they betraying. The Emperor"
15666,SCENE III,"Hath sacrificed me to my enemies,"
15667,SCENE III,"And I must fall, unless my gallant troops"
15668,SCENE III,Will rescue me. See! I confide in you.                              95
15669,SCENE III,And be your hearts my strong hold! At this breast
15670,SCENE III,"The aim is taken, at this hoary head."
15671,SCENE III,"This is your Spanish gratitude, this is our"
15672,SCENE III,Requital for that murderous fight at Lutzen!
15673,SCENE III,For this we threw the naked breast against                         100
15674,SCENE III,"The halbert, made for this the frozen earth"
15675,SCENE III,"Our bed, and the hard stone our pillow! never stream"
15676,SCENE III,"Too rapid for us, nor wood too impervious:"
15677,SCENE III,With cheerful spirit we pursued that Mansfield
15678,SCENE III,Through all the turns and windings of his flight;                  105
15679,SCENE III,"Yea, our whole life was but one restless march;"
15680,SCENE III,"And homeless, as the stirring wind, we travelled"
15681,SCENE III,"O'er the war-wasted earth. And now, even now,"
15682,SCENE III,"That we have well-nigh finished the hard toil,"
15683,SCENE III,"The unthankful, the curse-laden toil of weapons,                   110"
15684,SCENE III,With faithful indefatigable arm
15685,SCENE III,"Have rolled the heavy war-load up the hill,"
15686,SCENE III,Behold! this boy of the Emperor's bears away
15687,SCENE III,"The honours of the peace, an easy prize!"
15688,SCENE III,"He'll weave, forsooth, into his flaxen locks                       115"
15689,SCENE III,"The olive branch, the hard-earn'd ornament"
15690,SCENE III,"Of this grey head, grown grey beneath the helmet."
15691,SCENE III,
15692,SCENE III,"_Anspessade._ That shall he not, while we can hinder it!"
15693,SCENE III,"No one, but thou, who hast conducted it"
15694,SCENE III,"With fame, shall end this war, this frightful war.                 120"
15695,SCENE III,Thou led'st us out into the bloody field
15696,SCENE III,"Of death, thou and no other shalt conduct us home,"
15697,SCENE III,"Rejoicing, to the lovely plains of peace--"
15698,SCENE III,Shalt share with us the fruits of the long toil--
15699,SCENE III,
15700,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ What? Think you then at length in late old age      125
15701,SCENE III,To enjoy the fruits of toil? Believe it not.
15702,SCENE III,"Never, no never, will you see the end"
15703,SCENE III,"Of the contest! you and me, and all of us,"
15704,SCENE III,"This war will swallow up! War, war, not peace,"
15705,SCENE III,"Is Austria's wish; and therefore, because I                        130"
15706,SCENE III,"Endeavoured after peace, therefore I fall."
15707,SCENE III,"For what cares Austria, how long the war"
15708,SCENE III,Wears out the armies and lays waste the world?
15709,SCENE III,"She will but wax and grow amid the ruin,"
15710,SCENE III,And still win new domains.
15711,SCENE III,
15712,SCENE III,[_The Cuirassiers express agitation by their gestures._
15713,SCENE III,
15714,SCENE III,Ye're moved--I see                      135
15715,SCENE III,"A noble rage flash from your eyes, ye warriors!"
15716,SCENE III,Oh that my spirit might possess you now
15717,SCENE III,Daring as once it led you to the battle!
15718,SCENE III,"Ye would stand by me with your veteran arms,"
15719,SCENE III,Protect me in my rights; and this is noble!                        140
15720,SCENE III,"But think not that you can accomplish it,"
15721,SCENE III,Your scanty number! to no purpose will you
15722,SCENE III,Have sacrificed you for your General.
15723,SCENE III,"No! let us tread securely, seek for friends;"
15724,SCENE III,"The Swedes have proffered us assistance, let us                    145"
15725,SCENE III,"Wear for a while the appearance of good will,"
15726,SCENE III,"And use them for your profit, till we both"
15727,SCENE III,"Carry the fate of Europe in our hands,"
15728,SCENE III,And from our camp to the glad jubilant world
15729,SCENE III,Lead Peace forth with the garland on her head!                     150
15730,SCENE III,
15731,SCENE III,_Anspessade._ 'Tis then but mere appearances which thou
15732,SCENE III,Dost put on with the Swede? Thou'lt not betray
15733,SCENE III,The Emperor? Wilt not turn us into Swedes?
15734,SCENE III,This is the only thing which we desire
15735,SCENE III,To learn from thee.
15736,SCENE III,
15737,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._      What care I for the Swedes?                    155
15738,SCENE III,"I hate them as I hate the pit of hell,"
15739,SCENE III,And under Providence I trust right soon
15740,SCENE III,To chase them to their homes across their Baltic.
15741,SCENE III,My cares are only for the whole: I have
15742,SCENE III,A heart--it bleeds within me for the miseries                      160
15743,SCENE III,And piteous groaning of my fellow-Germans.
15744,SCENE III,"Ye are but common men, but yet ye think"
15745,SCENE III,With minds not common; ye appear to me
15746,SCENE III,"Worthy before all others, that I whisper ye"
15747,SCENE III,A little word or two in confidence!                                165
15748,SCENE III,See now! already for full fifteen years
15749,SCENE III,"The war-torch has continued burning, yet"
15750,SCENE III,"No rest, no pause of conflict. Swede and German,"
15751,SCENE III,Papist and Lutheran! neither will give way
15752,SCENE III,"To the other, every hand's against the other.                      170"
15753,SCENE III,Each one is party and no one a judge.
15754,SCENE III,Where shall this end? Where's he that will unravel
15755,SCENE III,"This tangle, ever tangling more and more."
15756,SCENE III,It must be cut asunder.
15757,SCENE III,"I feel that I am the man of destiny,                               175"

15978,SCENE VI,Laid waste for ever--that concerns not thee.

15994,SCENE VI,"War had I ne'er denounced against him. No,"
15995,SCENE VI,I never could have done it. The Emperor was
15996,SCENE VI,"My austere master only, not my friend."
15997,SCENE VI,There was already war 'twixt him and me
15998,SCENE VI,When he delivered the Commander's Staff                             65
15999,SCENE VI,Into my hands; for there's a natural
16000,SCENE VI,Unceasing war 'twixt cunning and suspicion;
16001,SCENE VI,Peace exists only betwixt confidence

16011,SCENE VI,To whom have we been faithless? Wherefore must
16012,SCENE VI,The evil deeds and guilt reciprocal
16013,SCENE VI,Of our two fathers twine like serpents round us?
16014,SCENE VI,Why must our fathers'
16015,SCENE VI,"Unconquerable hate rend us asunder,"

16020,SCENE VI,"How when at Prague, our winter quarters, thou"
16021,SCENE VI,"Wert brought into my tent a tender boy,"
16022,SCENE VI,Not yet accustomed to the German winters;
16023,SCENE VI,Thy hand was frozen to the heavy colours;                           85
16024,SCENE VI,Thou would'st not let them go.--
16025,SCENE VI,"At that time did I take thee in my arms,"
16026,SCENE VI,And with my mantle did I cover thee;
16027,SCENE VI,"I was thy nurse, no woman could have been"
16028,SCENE VI,A kinder to thee; I was not ashamed                                 90
16029,SCENE VI,"To do for thee all little offices,"
16030,SCENE VI,However strange to me; I tended thee
16031,SCENE VI,"Till life returned; and when thine eyes first opened,"
16032,SCENE VI,"I had thee in my arms. Since then, when have I"
16033,SCENE VI,Altered my feelings towards thee? Many thousands                    95
16034,SCENE VI,"Have I made rich, presented them with lands;"
16035,SCENE VI,Rewarded them with dignities and honours;
16036,SCENE VI,"Thee have I loved: my heart, my self, I gave"
16037,SCENE VI,To thee! They all were aliens: thou wert
16038,SCENE VI,Our child and inmate.[755:1] Max! Thou canst not leave me;         100
16039,SCENE VI,"It cannot be; I may not, will not think"
16040,SCENE VI,That Max can leave me.
16041,SCENE VI,
16042,SCENE VI,_Max._                 O my God!
16043,SCENE VI,
16044,SCENE VI,_Wallenstein._                   I have
16045,SCENE VI,Held and sustained thee from thy tottering childhood.
16046,SCENE VI,What holy bond is there of natural love?
16047,SCENE VI,"What human tie, that does not knit thee to me?                     105"
16048,SCENE VI,"I love thee, Max! What did thy father for thee,"
16049,SCENE VI,"Which I too have not done, to the height of duty?"
16050,SCENE VI,"Go hence, forsake me, serve thy Emperor;"
16051,SCENE VI,He will reward thee with a pretty chain
16052,SCENE VI,Of gold; with his ram's fleece will he reward thee;                110
16053,SCENE VI,"For that the friend, the father of thy youth,"
16054,SCENE VI,"For that the holiest feeling of humanity,"
16055,SCENE VI,Was nothing worth to thee.
16056,SCENE VI,
16057,SCENE VI,_Max._                     O God! how can I
16058,SCENE VI,Do otherwise? Am I not forced to do it?
16059,SCENE VI,My oath--my duty--honour--
16060,SCENE VI,
16061,SCENE VI,_Wallenstein._             How? Thy duty?                          115
16062,SCENE VI,Duty to whom? Who art thou? Max! bethink thee
16063,SCENE VI,What duties may'st thou have? If I am acting
16064,SCENE VI,"A criminal part toward the Emperor,"
16065,SCENE VI,"It is my crime, not thine. Dost thou belong"
16066,SCENE VI,To thine own self? Art thou thine own commander?                   120
16067,SCENE VI,"Stand'st thou, like me, a freeman in the world,"
16068,SCENE VI,That in thy actions thou should'st plead free agency?
16069,SCENE VI,"On me thou'rt planted, I am thy Emperor;"
16070,SCENE VI,"To obey me, to belong to me, this is"
16071,SCENE VI,"Thy honour, this a law of nature to thee!                          125"
16072,SCENE VI,"And if the planet, on the which thou liv'st"
16073,SCENE VI,"And hast thy dwelling, from its orbit starts,"
16074,SCENE VI,"It is not in thy choice, whether or no"
16075,SCENE VI,Thou'lt follow it. Unfelt it whirls thee onward
16076,SCENE VI,Together with his ring and all his moons.                          130
16077,SCENE VI,"With little guilt stepp'st thou into this contest,"
16078,SCENE VI,"Thee will the world not censure, it will praise thee,"
16079,SCENE VI,For that thou heldst thy friend more worth to thee
16080,SCENE VI,Than names and influences more removed.

16662,SCENE II,
16663,SCENE II,_Gordon._ Is it you?
16664,SCENE II,How my heart sinks! The Duke a fugitive traitor!
16665,SCENE II,His princely head attainted! O my God!
16666,SCENE II,
16667,SCENE II,_Butler._ You have received the letter which I sent you
16668,SCENE II,By a post-courier?
16669,SCENE II,
16670,SCENE II,_Gordon._          Yes! and in obedience to it                       5
16671,SCENE II,Opened the strong hold to him without scruple.
16672,SCENE II,For an imperial letter orders me
16673,SCENE II,To follow your commands implicitly.
16674,SCENE II,But yet forgive me; when even now I saw
16675,SCENE II,"The Duke himself, my scruples recommenced.                          10"
16676,SCENE II,"For truly, not like an attainted man,"
16677,SCENE II,Into this town did Friedland make his entrance;
16678,SCENE II,"His wonted majesty beamed from his brow,"
16679,SCENE II,"And calm, as in the days when all was right,"
16680,SCENE II,Did he receive from me the accounts of office;                      15
16681,SCENE II,"'Tis said, that fallen pride learns condescension:"
16682,SCENE II,But sparing and with dignity the Duke
16683,SCENE II,"Weighed every syllable of approbation,"
16684,SCENE II,As masters praise a servant who has done
16685,SCENE II,"His duty, and no more."
16686,SCENE II,
16687,SCENE II,_Butler._              'Tis all precisely                           20
16688,SCENE II,As I related in my letter. Friedland
16689,SCENE II,"Has sold the army to the enemy,"
16690,SCENE II,And pledged himself to give up Prague and Egra.
16691,SCENE II,"On this report the regiments all forsook him,"
16692,SCENE II,"The five excepted that belong to Tertsky,                           25"
16693,SCENE II,"And which have followed him, as thou hast seen."
16694,SCENE II,"The sentence of attainder is passed on him,"
16695,SCENE II,And every loyal subject is required
16696,SCENE II,"To give him in to justice, dead or living."
16697,SCENE II,
16698,SCENE II,_Gordon._ A traitor to the Emperor--Such a noble!                   30
16699,SCENE II,Of such high talents! What is human greatness!
16700,SCENE II,"I often said, this can't end happily."
16701,SCENE II,"His might, his greatness, and this obscure power"
16702,SCENE II,Are but a covered pit-fall. The human being
16703,SCENE II,May not be trusted to self-government.                              35
16704,SCENE II,"The clear and written law, the deep trod foot-marks"
16705,SCENE II,"Of ancient custom, are all necessary"
16706,SCENE II,To keep him in the road of faith and duty.
16707,SCENE II,The authority entrusted to this man
16708,SCENE II,Was unexampled and unnatural                                        40
16709,SCENE II,"It placed him on a level with his Emperor,"
16710,SCENE II,Till the proud soul unlearned submission. Wo is me;
16711,SCENE II,"I mourn for him! for where he fell, I deem"
16712,SCENE II,"Might none stand firm. Alas! dear General,"
16713,SCENE II,We in our lucky mediocrity                                          45
16714,SCENE II,"Have ne'er experienced, cannot calculate,"
16715,SCENE II,What dangerous wishes such a height may breed
16716,SCENE II,In the heart of such a man.
16717,SCENE II,
16718,SCENE II,_Butler._                   Spare your laments
16719,SCENE II,Till he need sympathy; for at this present
16720,SCENE II,"He is still mighty, and still formidable.                           50"
16721,SCENE II,"The Swedes advance to Egra by forced marches,"
16722,SCENE II,And quickly will the junction be accomplished.
16723,SCENE II,This must not be! The Duke must never leave
16724,SCENE II,This strong hold on free footing; for I have
16725,SCENE II,"Pledged life and honour here to hold him prisoner,                  55"
16726,SCENE II,And your assistance 'tis on which I calculate.
16727,SCENE II,
16728,SCENE II,_Gordon._ O that I had not lived to see this day!
16729,SCENE II,"From his hand I received this dignity,"
16730,SCENE II,"He did himself entrust this strong hold to me,"
16731,SCENE II,Which I am now required to make his dungeon.                        60
16732,SCENE II,We subalterns have no will of our own:
16733,SCENE II,"The free, the mighty man alone may listen"
16734,SCENE II,To the fair impulse of his human nature.
16735,SCENE II,"Ah! we are but the poor tools of the law,"
16736,SCENE II,Obedience the sole virtue we dare aim at!                           65
16737,SCENE II,
16738,SCENE II,"_Butler._ Nay, let it not afflict you, that your power"
16739,SCENE II,"Is circumscribed. Much liberty, much error!"
16740,SCENE II,The narrow path of duty is securest.
16741,SCENE II,
16742,SCENE II,"_Gordon._ And all then have deserted him, you say?"
16743,SCENE II,He has built up the luck of many thousands;                         70
16744,SCENE II,For kingly was his spirit: his full hand
16745,SCENE II,Was ever open! Many a one from dust
16746,SCENE II,"Hath he selected, from the very dust"
16747,SCENE II,Hath raised him into dignity and honour.
16748,SCENE II,"And yet no friend, not one friend hath he purchased,                75"
16749,SCENE II,Whose heart beats true to him in the evil hour.
16750,SCENE II,
16751,SCENE II,"_Butler._ Here's one, I see."
16752,SCENE II,
16753,SCENE II,_Gordon._                    I have enjoyed from him
16754,SCENE II,"No grace or favour. I could almost doubt,"
16755,SCENE II,If ever in his greatness he once thought on
16756,SCENE II,An old friend of his youth. For still my office                     80
16757,SCENE II,Kept me at distance from him; and when first
16758,SCENE II,"He to this citadel appointed me,"
16759,SCENE II,He was sincere and serious in his duty.
16760,SCENE II,"I do not then abuse his confidence,"
16761,SCENE II,If I preserve my fealty in that                                     85
16762,SCENE II,Which to my fealty was first delivered.
16763,SCENE II,
16764,SCENE II,"_Butler._ Say, then, will you fulfil the attainder on him?"
16765,SCENE II,
16766,SCENE II,_Gordon._ If it be so--if all be as you say--
16767,SCENE II,"If he've betrayed the Emperor, his master,"
16768,SCENE II,"Have sold the troops, have purposed to deliver                      90"
16769,SCENE II,The strong holds of the country to the enemy--
16770,SCENE II,"Yea, truly!---there is no redemption for him!"
16771,SCENE II,"Yet it is hard, that me the lot should destine"
16772,SCENE II,To be the instrument of his perdition;
16773,SCENE II,For we were pages at the court of Bergau                            95
16774,SCENE II,At the same period; but I was the senior.
16775,SCENE II,
16776,SCENE II,_Butler._ I have heard so----
16777,SCENE II,
16778,SCENE II,_Gordon._                     'Tis full thirty years since then.
16779,SCENE II,A youth who scarce had seen his twentieth year
16780,SCENE II,"Was Wallenstein, when he and I were friends:"
16781,SCENE II,Yet even then he had a daring soul:                                100
16782,SCENE II,His frame of mind was serious and severe
16783,SCENE II,Beyond his years: his dreams were of great objects.
16784,SCENE II,"He walked amidst us of a silent spirit,"
16785,SCENE II,Communing with himself: yet I have known him
16786,SCENE II,Transported on a sudden into utterance                             105
16787,SCENE II,Of strange conceptions; kindling into splendour
16788,SCENE II,"His soul revealed itself, and he spake so"
16789,SCENE II,"That we looked round perplexed upon each other,"
16790,SCENE II,"Not knowing whether it were craziness,"
16791,SCENE II,Or whether it were a god that spoke in him.                        110
16792,SCENE II,
16793,SCENE II,_Butler._ But was it where he fell two story high
16794,SCENE II,"From a window-ledge, on which he had fallen asleep;"
16795,SCENE II,And rose up free from injury? From this day
16796,SCENE II,(It is reported) he betrayed clear marks
16797,SCENE II,Of a distempered fancy.
16798,SCENE II,
16799,SCENE II,_Gordon._               He became                                  115
16800,SCENE II,Doubtless more self-enwrapt and melancholy;
16801,SCENE II,He made himself a Catholic. Marvellously
16802,SCENE II,His marvellous preservation had transformed him.
16803,SCENE II,Thenceforth he held himself for an exempted
16804,SCENE II,"And privileged being, and, as if he were                           120"
16805,SCENE II,"Incapable of dizziness or fall,"
16806,SCENE II,He ran along the unsteady rope of life.
16807,SCENE II,But now our destinies drove us asunder:
16808,SCENE II,"He paced with rapid step the way of greatness,"
16809,SCENE II,"Was Count, and Prince, Duke-regent, and Dictator.                  125"
16810,SCENE II,"And now is all, all this too little for him;"
16811,SCENE II,"He stretches forth his hands for a king's crown,"
16812,SCENE II,And plunges in unfathomable ruin.

16877,SCENE III,Hark'e! But keep it to yourself! The end                            30
16878,SCENE III,Approaches of the Spanish double monarchy--
16879,SCENE III,A new arrangement is at hand. You saw
16880,SCENE III,The three moons that appeared at once in the Heaven.
16881,SCENE III,
16882,SCENE III,_Burgomaster._ With wonder and affright!
16883,SCENE III,
16884,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._                           Whereof did two
16885,SCENE III,Strangely transform themselves to bloody daggers.                   35
16886,SCENE III,"And only one, the middle moon, remained"
16887,SCENE III,Steady and clear.
16888,SCENE III,
16889,SCENE III,_Burgomaster._    We applied it to the Turks.
16890,SCENE III,
16891,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein._ The Turks! That all?--I tell you, that two empires"
16892,SCENE III,"Will set in blood, in the East and in the West,"
16893,SCENE III,And Luth'ranism alone remain.   [_Observing GORDON and BUTLER._
16894,SCENE III,"I'faith,                              40"
16895,SCENE III,'Twas a smart cannonading that we heard
16896,SCENE III,"This evening, as we journeyed hitherward;"
16897,SCENE III,'Twas on our left hand. Did you hear it here?
16898,SCENE III,
16899,SCENE III,_Gordon._ Distinctly. The wind brought it from the South.
16900,SCENE III,
16901,SCENE III,_Butler._ It seemed to come from Weiden or from Neustadt.           45
16902,SCENE III,
16903,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Tis likely. That's the route the Swedes are taking.
16904,SCENE III,How strong is the garrison?
16905,SCENE III,
16906,SCENE III,_Gordon._                   Not quite two hundred
16907,SCENE III,"Competent men, the rest are invalids."
16908,SCENE III,
16909,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Good! And how many in the vale of Jochim?
16910,SCENE III,
16911,SCENE III,_Gordon._ Two hundred arquebussiers have I sent thither             50
16912,SCENE III,To fortify the posts against the Swedes.
16913,SCENE III,
16914,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Good! I commend your foresight. At the works too
16915,SCENE III,You have done somewhat?
16916,SCENE III,
16917,SCENE III,_Gordon._               Two additional batteries
16918,SCENE III,I caused to be run up. They were needless.
16919,SCENE III,"The Rhinegrave presses hard upon us, General!                       55"
16920,SCENE III,
16921,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ You have been watchful in your Emperor's service.
16922,SCENE III,"I am content with you, Lieutenant-Colonel.        [_To BUTLER._"
16923,SCENE III,Release the outposts in the vale of Jochim
16924,SCENE III,With all the stations in the enemy's route.       [_To GORDON._
16925,SCENE III,"Governor, in your faithful hands I leave                            60"
16926,SCENE III,"My wife, my daughter, and my sister. I"
16927,SCENE III,"Shall make no stay here, and wait but the arrival"

16956,SCENE IV,At Neustadt; the Swedes gained the victory.
16957,SCENE IV,
16958,SCENE IV,_Wallenstein._ From whence did you receive the intelligence?
16959,SCENE IV,
16960,SCENE IV,_Tertsky._ A countryman from Tirschenseil conveyed it.               5
16961,SCENE IV,Soon after sunrise did the fight begin!
16962,SCENE IV,A troop of the Imperialists from Fachau
16963,SCENE IV,Had forced their way into the Swedish camp;
16964,SCENE IV,The cannonade continued full two hours;
16965,SCENE IV,There were left dead upon the field a thousand                      10

16987,SCENE V,
16988,SCENE V,_Tertsky._ Does he bring confirmation of the victory?
16989,SCENE V,
16990,SCENE V,_Wallenstein._ What does he bring? Whence comes he?
16991,SCENE V,
16992,SCENE V,_Illo._                                             From the
16993,SCENE V,Rhinegrave.
16994,SCENE V,And what he brings I can announce to you

16996,SCENE V,At Neustadt did Max Piccolomini
16997,SCENE V,Throw himself on them with the cavalry;

17043,SCENE VI,
17044,SCENE VI,_Butler._              She has lost the man she lov'd--
17045,SCENE VI,"Young Piccolomini, who fell in the battle."
17046,SCENE VI,
17047,SCENE VI,_Gordon._ Unfortunate Lady!
17048,SCENE VI,
17049,SCENE VI,_Butler._                   You have heard what Illo
17050,SCENE VI,"Reporteth, that the Swedes are conquerors,"
17051,SCENE VI,And marching hitherward.
17052,SCENE VI,
17053,SCENE VI,_Gordon._                Too well I heard it.                        5
17054,SCENE VI,
17055,SCENE VI,"_Butler._ They are twelve regiments strong, and there are five"
17056,SCENE VI,Close by us to protect the Duke. We have
17057,SCENE VI,Only my single regiment; and the garrison
17058,SCENE VI,Is not two hundred strong.
17059,SCENE VI,
17060,SCENE VI,_Gordon._                  'Tis even so.
17061,SCENE VI,
17062,SCENE VI,_Butler._ It is not possible with such small force                  10
17063,SCENE VI,To hold in custody a man like him.
17064,SCENE VI,
17065,SCENE VI,_Gordon._ I grant it.
17066,SCENE VI,

17068,SCENE VI,And liberate him.

17072,SCENE VI,"_Butler (after a pause)._ Know, I am warranty for the event;"
17073,SCENE VI,"With my head have I pledged myself for his,                         15"
17074,SCENE VI,"Must make my word good, cost it what it will,"

17076,SCENE VI,Why--death makes all things certain!
17077,SCENE VI,
17078,SCENE VI,_Gordon._                            Butler! What?
17079,SCENE VI,Do I understand you? Gracious God! You could--
17080,SCENE VI,
17081,SCENE VI,_Butler._ He must not live.
17082,SCENE VI,
17083,SCENE VI,_Gordon._                   And you can do the deed!                20
17084,SCENE VI,
17085,SCENE VI,_Butler._ Either you or I. This morning was his last.
17086,SCENE VI,
17087,SCENE VI,_Gordon._ You would assassinate him.
17088,SCENE VI,
17089,SCENE VI,_Butler._                            'Tis my purpose.
17090,SCENE VI,
17091,SCENE VI,_Gordon._ Who leans with his whole confidence upon you!
17092,SCENE VI,
17093,SCENE VI,_Butler._ Such is his evil destiny!
17094,SCENE VI,
17095,SCENE VI,_Gordon._                           Your General!
17096,SCENE VI,The sacred person of your General!                                  25
17097,SCENE VI,
17098,SCENE VI,_Butler._ My General he has been.
17099,SCENE VI,
17100,SCENE VI,_Gordon._                         That 'tis only
17101,SCENE VI,A '_has been_' washes out no villainy.
17102,SCENE VI,And without judgment passed?
17103,SCENE VI,
17104,SCENE VI,_Butler._                    The execution
17105,SCENE VI,Is here instead of judgment.
17106,SCENE VI,
17107,SCENE VI,"_Gordon._                    This were murder,"
17108,SCENE VI,Not justice. The most guilty should be heard.                       30
17109,SCENE VI,
17110,SCENE VI,"_Butler._ His guilt is clear, the Emperor has passed judgment,"
17111,SCENE VI,And we but execute his will.
17112,SCENE VI,
17113,SCENE VI,_Gordon._                    We should not
17114,SCENE VI,Hurry to realize a bloody sentence.
17115,SCENE VI,"A word may be recalled, a life can never be."
17116,SCENE VI,
17117,SCENE VI,_Butler._ Dispatch in service pleases sovereigns.                   35
17118,SCENE VI,
17119,SCENE VI,_Gordon._ No honest man's ambitious to press forward
17120,SCENE VI,To the hangman's service.
17121,SCENE VI,
17122,SCENE VI,_Butler._                 And no brave man loses
17123,SCENE VI,His colour at a daring enterprize.
17124,SCENE VI,
17125,SCENE VI,"_Gordon._ A brave man hazards life, but not his conscience."
17126,SCENE VI,
17127,SCENE VI,_Butler._ What then? Shall he go forth anew to kindle               40
17128,SCENE VI,The unextinguishable flame of war?
17129,SCENE VI,
17130,SCENE VI,"_Gordon._ Seize him, and hold him prisoner--do not kill him."
17131,SCENE VI,
17132,SCENE VI,"_Butler._ Had not the Emperor's army been defeated,"
17133,SCENE VI,I might have done so.--But 'tis now past by.
17134,SCENE VI,
17135,SCENE VI,"_Gordon._ O, wherefore opened I the strong hold to him!             45"
17136,SCENE VI,
17137,SCENE VI,_Butler._ His destiny and not the place destroys him.
17138,SCENE VI,
17139,SCENE VI,"_Gordon._ Upon these ramparts, as beseemed a soldier,"
17140,SCENE VI,"I had fallen, defending the Emperor's citadel!"
17141,SCENE VI,
17142,SCENE VI,_Butler._ Yes! and a thousand gallant men have perished.
17143,SCENE VI,
17144,SCENE VI,_Gordon._ Doing their duty--that adorns the man!                    50
17145,SCENE VI,"But murder's a black deed, and nature curses it."
17146,SCENE VI,
17147,SCENE VI,_Butler (brings out a paper)._ Here is the manifesto which
17148,SCENE VI,commands us
17149,SCENE VI,To gain possession of his person. See--
17150,SCENE VI,It is addressed to you as well as me.
17151,SCENE VI,"Are you content to take the consequences,                           55"
17152,SCENE VI,If through our fault he escape to the enemy?
17153,SCENE VI,
17154,SCENE VI,_Gordon._ I?--Gracious God!
17155,SCENE VI,
17156,SCENE VI,_Butler._                   Take it on yourself.
17157,SCENE VI,"Let come of it what may, on you I lay it."
17158,SCENE VI,
17159,SCENE VI,_Gordon._ O God in heaven!
17160,SCENE VI,
17161,SCENE VI,_Butler._                  Can you advise aught else
17162,SCENE VI,Wherewith to execute the Emperor's purpose?                         60
17163,SCENE VI,"Say if you can. For I desire his fall,"
17164,SCENE VI,Not his destruction.
17165,SCENE VI,
17166,SCENE VI,_Gordon._            Merciful heaven! what must be
17167,SCENE VI,I see as clear as you. Yet still the heart
17168,SCENE VI,Within my bosom beats with other feelings!
17169,SCENE VI,
17170,SCENE VI,_Butler._ Mine is of harder stuff! Necessity                        65
17171,SCENE VI,In her rough school hath steeled me. And this Illo
17172,SCENE VI,"And Tertsky likewise, they must not survive him."
17173,SCENE VI,
17174,SCENE VI,_Gordon._ I feel no pang for these. Their own bad hearts
17175,SCENE VI,"Impelled them, not the influence of the stars."
17176,SCENE VI,'Twas they who strewed the seeds of evil passions                   70
17177,SCENE VI,"In his calm breast, and with officious villainy"
17178,SCENE VI,Watered and nursed the pois'nous plants. May they
17179,SCENE VI,Receive their earnests to the uttermost mite!
17180,SCENE VI,
17181,SCENE VI,_Butler._ And their death shall precede his!
17182,SCENE VI,We meant to have taken them alive this evening                      75
17183,SCENE VI,"Amid the merry-making of a feast,"

17233,SCENE VII,"_Tertsky._ Hush, hush! Let the dead rest! This evening's business"
17234,SCENE VII,"Is, who can fairly drink the other down--                           25"
17235,SCENE VII,"Your regiment, Illo! gives the entertainment."
17236,SCENE VII,Come! we will keep a merry carnival--
17237,SCENE VII,"The night for once be day, and mid full glasses"
17238,SCENE VII,Will we expect the Swedish Avantgarde.
17239,SCENE VII,
17240,SCENE VII,"_Illo._ Yes, let us be of good cheer for to-day,                    30"
17241,SCENE VII,"For there's hot work before us, friends! This sword"
17242,SCENE VII,"Shall have no rest, till it be bathed to the hilt"
17243,SCENE VII,In Austrian blood.
17244,SCENE VII,
17245,SCENE VII,"_Gordon._          Shame, shame! what talk is this,"
17246,SCENE VII,My Lord Field Marshal? Wherefore foam you so
17247,SCENE VII,Against your Emperor?
17248,SCENE VII,
17249,SCENE VII,_Butler._             Hope not too much                             35
17250,SCENE VII,"From this first victory. Bethink you, sirs!"
17251,SCENE VII,How rapidly the wheel of Fortune turns;
17252,SCENE VII,The Emperor still is formidably strong.
17253,SCENE VII,
17254,SCENE VII,"_Illo._ The Emperor has soldiers, no commander,"
17255,SCENE VII,For this King Ferdinand of Hungary                                  40
17256,SCENE VII,"Is but a tyro. Galas? He's no luck,"
17257,SCENE VII,And was of old the ruiner of armies.
17258,SCENE VII,"And then this viper, this Octavio,"
17259,SCENE VII,"Is excellent at stabbing in the back,"
17260,SCENE VII,But ne'er meets Friedland in the open field.                        45
17261,SCENE VII,
17262,SCENE VII,"_Tertsky._ Trust me, my friends, it cannot but succeed;"
17263,SCENE VII,"Fortune, we know, can ne'er forsake the Duke!"
17264,SCENE VII,And only under Wallenstein can Austria
17265,SCENE VII,Be conqueror.
17266,SCENE VII,
17267,SCENE VII,_Illo._       The Duke will soon assemble
17268,SCENE VII,"A mighty army, all come crowding, streaming                         50"
17269,SCENE VII,To banners dedicate by destiny
17270,SCENE VII,To fame and prosperous fortune. I behold
17271,SCENE VII,"Old times come back again, he will become"
17272,SCENE VII,Once more the mighty Lord which he has been.
17273,SCENE VII,"How will the fools, who've now deserted him,                        55"
17274,SCENE VII,"Look then? I can't but laugh to think of them,"
17275,SCENE VII,"For lands will he present to all his friends,"
17276,SCENE VII,And like a King and Emperor reward
17277,SCENE VII,True services; but we've the nearest claims.      [_To GORDON._
17278,SCENE VII,"You will not be forgotten, Governor!                                60"
17279,SCENE VII,He'll take you from this nest and bid you shine
17280,SCENE VII,In higher station: your fidelity
17281,SCENE VII,Well merits it.
17282,SCENE VII,
17283,SCENE VII,"_Gordon._       I am content already,"
17284,SCENE VII,And wish to climb no higher; where great height is
17285,SCENE VII,"The fall must needs be great. 'Great height, great depth.'          65"
17286,SCENE VII,
17287,SCENE VII,_Illo._ Here you have no more business for to-morrow;
17288,SCENE VII,The Swedes will take possession of the citadel.
17289,SCENE VII,"Come, Tertsky, it is supper-time. What think you?"
17290,SCENE VII,"Say, shall we have the State illuminated"
17291,SCENE VII,In honour of the Swede? And who refuses                             70
17292,SCENE VII,To do it is a Spaniard and a traitor.
17293,SCENE VII,
17294,SCENE VII,"_Tertsky._ Nay! Nay! not that, it will not please the Duke--"
17295,SCENE VII,
17296,SCENE VII,_Illo._ What! we are masters here; no soul shall dare
17297,SCENE VII,Avow himself imperial where we've rule.
17298,SCENE VII,"Gordon! Good night, and for the last time, take                     75"
17299,SCENE VII,A fair leave of the place. Send out patroles
17300,SCENE VII,"To make secure, the watch-word may be altered"
17301,SCENE VII,At the stroke of ten; deliver in the keys
17302,SCENE VII,"To the Duke himself, and then you're quit for ever"
17303,SCENE VII,"Your wardship of the gates, for on to-morrow                        80"
17304,SCENE VII,The Swedes will take possession of the citadel.

17326,SCENE VIII,In the blind drunkenness of victory;

17343,SCENE VIII,
17344,SCENE VIII,"_Gordon._ Ah! your looks tell me nothing good. Nay, Butler,         15"
17345,SCENE VIII,"I pray you, promise me!"
17346,SCENE VIII,
17347,SCENE VIII,_Butler._               The sun has set;
17348,SCENE VIII,"A fateful evening doth descend upon us,"
17349,SCENE VIII,And brings on their long night! Their evil stars
17350,SCENE VIII,Deliver them unarmed into our hands.
17351,SCENE VIII,And from their drunken dream of golden fortunes                     20
17352,SCENE VIII,"The dagger at their heart shall rouse them. Well,"
17353,SCENE VIII,The Duke was ever a great calculator;
17354,SCENE VIII,"His fellow-men were figures on his chess-board,"
17355,SCENE VIII,"To move and station, as his game required."
17356,SCENE VIII,"Other men's honour, dignity, good name,                             25"
17357,SCENE VIII,"Did he shift like pawns, and made no conscience of it:"
17358,SCENE VIII,"Still calculating, calculating still;"
17359,SCENE VIII,And yet at last his calculation proves
17360,SCENE VIII,Erroneous; the whole game is lost; and lo!
17361,SCENE VIII,His own life will be found among the forfeits.                      30
17362,SCENE VIII,
17363,SCENE VIII,_Gordon._ O think not of his errors now; remember
17364,SCENE VIII,"His greatness, his munificence, think on all"
17365,SCENE VIII,"The lovely features of his character,"
17366,SCENE VIII,"On all the noble exploits of his life,"

17373,SCENE VIII,
17374,SCENE VIII,[_Grasping GORDON'S hand._
17375,SCENE VIII,
17376,SCENE VIII,Gordon! 'Tis not my hatred (I pretend not
17377,SCENE VIII,"To love the Duke, and have no cause to love him)                    40"
17378,SCENE VIII,Yet 'tis not now my hatred that impels me
17379,SCENE VIII,To be his murderer. 'Tis his evil fate.
17380,SCENE VIII,Hostile concurrences of many events
17381,SCENE VIII,Control and subjugate me to the office.
17382,SCENE VIII,In vain the human being meditates                                   45
17383,SCENE VIII,Free action. He is but the wire-worked[777:1] puppet
17384,SCENE VIII,"Of the blind power, which out of his own choice"
17385,SCENE VIII,Creates for him a dread necessity.
17386,SCENE VIII,"What too would it avail him, if there were"
17387,SCENE VIII,A something pleading for him in my heart--                          50
17388,SCENE VIII,Still I must kill him.
17389,SCENE VIII,
17390,SCENE VIII,"_Gordon._              If your heart speak to you,"
17391,SCENE VIII,Follow its impulse. 'Tis the voice of God.
17392,SCENE VIII,Think you your fortunes will grow prosperous
17393,SCENE VIII,Bedewed with blood--his blood? Believe it not!
17394,SCENE VIII,
17395,SCENE VIII,"_Butler._ You know not. Ask not! Wherefore should it happen,        55"
17396,SCENE VIII,"That the Swedes gained the victory, and hasten"
17397,SCENE VIII,With such forced marches hitherward? Fain would I
17398,SCENE VIII,Have given him to the Emperor's mercy.--Gordon!
17399,SCENE VIII,I do not wish his blood--But I must ransom
17400,SCENE VIII,The honour of my word--it lies in pledge--                          60
17401,SCENE VIII,"And he must die, or----"
17402,SCENE VIII,
17403,SCENE VIII,[_Passionately grasping GORDON'S hand._
17404,SCENE VIII,
17405,SCENE VIII,"Listen then, and know!"
17406,SCENE VIII,I am dishonoured if the Duke escape us.
17407,SCENE VIII,
17408,SCENE VIII,_Gordon._ O! to save such a man----
17409,SCENE VIII,
17410,SCENE VIII,_Butler._                           What!
17411,SCENE VIII,
17412,SCENE VIII,_Gordon._                                 It is worth
17413,SCENE VIII,"A sacrifice.--Come, friend! Be noble-minded!"
17414,SCENE VIII,"Our own heart, and not other men's opinions,                        65"
17415,SCENE VIII,Forms our true honour.
17416,SCENE VIII,
17417,SCENE VIII,"_Butler._              He is a great Lord,"
17418,SCENE VIII,This Duke--and I am but of mean importance.
17419,SCENE VIII,This is what you would say? Wherein concerns it
17420,SCENE VIII,"The world at large, you mean to hint to me,"
17421,SCENE VIII,Whether the man of low extraction keeps                             70
17422,SCENE VIII,Or blemishes his honour--
17423,SCENE VIII,So that the man of princely rank be saved.
17424,SCENE VIII,We all do stamp our value on ourselves.
17425,SCENE VIII,The price we challenge for ourselves is given us.
17426,SCENE VIII,"There does not live on earth the man so stationed,                  75"
17427,SCENE VIII,That I despise myself compared with him.
17428,SCENE VIII,Man is made great or little by his own will;
17429,SCENE VIII,"Because I am true to mine, therefore he dies."
17430,SCENE VIII,
17431,SCENE VIII,_Gordon._ I am endeavouring to move a rock.
17432,SCENE VIII,"Thou hadst a mother, yet no human feelings.                         80"
17433,SCENE VIII,"I cannot hinder you, but may some God"
17434,SCENE VIII,Rescue him from you!                            [_Exit GORDON._

17577,SCENE II,"_Butler._                     Ay, and make your fortunes.           20"
17578,SCENE II,
17579,SCENE II,_Macdonald._ That is still better.
17580,SCENE II,
17581,SCENE II,_Butler._                          Listen!
17582,SCENE II,
17583,SCENE II,_Both._                                    We attend.
17584,SCENE II,
17585,SCENE II,_Butler._ It is the Emperor's will and ordinance
17586,SCENE II,"To seize the person of the Prince-Duke Friedland,"
17587,SCENE II,Alive or dead.
17588,SCENE II,
17589,SCENE II,_Devereux._    It runs so in the letter.
17590,SCENE II,
17591,SCENE II,_Macdonald._ Alive or dead--these were the very words.              25
17592,SCENE II,
17593,SCENE II,_Butler._ And he shall be rewarded from the State
17594,SCENE II,"In land and gold, who proffers aid thereto."
17595,SCENE II,
17596,SCENE II,_Devereux._ Ay? That sounds well. The words sound always well
17597,SCENE II,That travel hither from the Court. Yes! yes!
17598,SCENE II,We know already what Court-words import.                            30
17599,SCENE II,"A golden chain perhaps in sign of favour,"
17600,SCENE II,"Or an old charger, or a parchment patent,"
17601,SCENE II,And such like.--The Prince-duke pays better.
17602,SCENE II,
17603,SCENE II,"_Macdonald._                                 Yes,"
17604,SCENE II,The Duke's a splendid paymaster.
17605,SCENE II,
17606,SCENE II,_Butler._                        All over
17607,SCENE II,"With that, my friends! His lucky stars are set.                     35"
17608,SCENE II,
17609,SCENE II,_Macdonald._ And is that certain?
17610,SCENE II,
17611,SCENE II,_Butler._                         You have my word for it.
17612,SCENE II,
17613,SCENE II,_Devereux._ His lucky fortunes all past by?
17614,SCENE II,
17615,SCENE II,_Butler._                                   For ever.
17616,SCENE II,He is as poor as we.
17617,SCENE II,
17618,SCENE II,_Macdonald._         As poor as we?
17619,SCENE II,
17620,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ Macdonald, we'll desert him."
17621,SCENE II,
17622,SCENE II,_Butler._                                We'll desert him?
17623,SCENE II,Full twenty thousand have done that already;                        40
17624,SCENE II,"We must do more, my countrymen! In short--"
17625,SCENE II,We--we must kill him.
17626,SCENE II,
17627,SCENE II,_Both._               Kill him!
17628,SCENE II,
17629,SCENE II,_Butler._                       Yes! must kill him.
17630,SCENE II,And for that purpose have I chosen you.
17631,SCENE II,
17632,SCENE II,_Both._                                 Us!
17633,SCENE II,
17634,SCENE II,"_Butler._ You, Captain Devereux, and thee, Macdonald.               45"
17635,SCENE II,
17636,SCENE II,_Devereux (after a pause)._ Choose you some other.
17637,SCENE II,
17638,SCENE II,_Butler._                                          What? art
17639,SCENE II,dastardly?
17640,SCENE II,"Thou, with full thirty lives to answer for--"
17641,SCENE II,Thou conscientious of a sudden?
17642,SCENE II,
17643,SCENE II,"_Devereux._                     Nay,"
17644,SCENE II,To assassinate our Lord and General--
17645,SCENE II,
17646,SCENE II,_Macdonald._ To whom we've sworn a soldier's oath--
17647,SCENE II,
17648,SCENE II,_Butler._                                           The oath        50
17649,SCENE II,"Is null, for Friedland is a traitor."
17650,SCENE II,
17651,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ No, no! It is too bad!"
17652,SCENE II,
17653,SCENE II,"_Macdonald._                       Yes, by my soul!"
17654,SCENE II,It is too bad. One has a conscience too--
17655,SCENE II,
17656,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ If it were not our chieftain, who so long"
17657,SCENE II,"Has issued the commands, and claim'd our duty.                      55"
17658,SCENE II,
17659,SCENE II,_Butler._ Is that the objection?
17660,SCENE II,
17661,SCENE II,"_Devereux._                      Were it my own father,"
17662,SCENE II,"And the Emperor's service should demand it of me,"
17663,SCENE II,"It might be done perhaps--But we are soldiers,"
17664,SCENE II,"And to assassinate our chief commander,"
17665,SCENE II,"That is a sin, a foul abomination,                                  60"
17666,SCENE II,From which no monk or confessor absolves us.
17667,SCENE II,
17668,SCENE II,"_Butler._ I am your Pope, and give you absolution."
17669,SCENE II,Determine quickly!
17670,SCENE II,
17671,SCENE II,_Devereux._        'Twill not do!
17672,SCENE II,
17673,SCENE II,_Macdonald._                      'Twon't do!
17674,SCENE II,
17675,SCENE II,"_Butler._ Well, off then! and--send Pestalutz to me."
17676,SCENE II,
17677,SCENE II,_Devereux._ The Pestalutz--
17678,SCENE II,
17679,SCENE II,_Macdonald._                What may you want with him?             65
17680,SCENE II,
17681,SCENE II,"_Butler._ If you reject it, we can find enough--"
17682,SCENE II,
17683,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ Nay, if he must fall, we may earn the bounty"
17684,SCENE II,"As well as any other. What think you,"
17685,SCENE II,Brother Macdonald?
17686,SCENE II,
17687,SCENE II,"_Macdonald._       Why if he must fall,"
17688,SCENE II,"And will fall, and it can't be otherwise,                           70"
17689,SCENE II,One would not give place to this Pestalutz.
17690,SCENE II,
17691,SCENE II,_Devereux._ When do you purpose he should fall?
17692,SCENE II,
17693,SCENE II,_Butler._                                       This night.
17694,SCENE II,To-morrow will the Swedes be at our gates.
17695,SCENE II,
17696,SCENE II,_Devereux._ You take upon you all the consequences!
17697,SCENE II,
17698,SCENE II,_Butler._ I take the whole upon me.
17699,SCENE II,
17700,SCENE II,_Devereux._                         And it is                       75
17701,SCENE II,"The Emperor's will, his express absolute will?"
17702,SCENE II,"For we have instances, that folks may like"
17703,SCENE II,"The murder, and yet hang the murderer."
17704,SCENE II,
17705,SCENE II,_Butler._ The manifesto says--alive or dead.
17706,SCENE II,Alive--'tis not possible--you see it is not.                        80
17707,SCENE II,
17708,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ Well, dead then! dead! But how can we come at him?"
17709,SCENE II,The town is fill'd with Tertsky's soldiery.
17710,SCENE II,
17711,SCENE II,"_Macdonald._ Ay! and then Tertsky still remains, and Illo--"
17712,SCENE II,
17713,SCENE II,_Butler._ With these you shall begin--you understand me?
17714,SCENE II,
17715,SCENE II,_Devereux._ How? And must they too perish?
17716,SCENE II,
17717,SCENE II,_Butler._                                  They the first.          85
17718,SCENE II,
17719,SCENE II,"_Macdonald._ Hear, Devereux? A bloody evening this."
17720,SCENE II,
17721,SCENE II,_Devereux._ Have you a man for that? Commission me--
17722,SCENE II,
17723,SCENE II,_Butler._ 'Tis given in trust to Major Geraldin;
17724,SCENE II,"This is a carnival night, and there's a feast"
17725,SCENE II,"Given at the castle--there we shall surprise them,                  90"
17726,SCENE II,And hew them down. The Pestalutz and Lesley
17727,SCENE II,Have that commission--soon as that is finished--
17728,SCENE II,
17729,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ Hear, General! It will be all one to you."
17730,SCENE II,Hark'e! let me exchange with Geraldin.
17731,SCENE II,
17732,SCENE II,_Butler._ 'Twill be the lesser danger with the Duke.                95
17733,SCENE II,
17734,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ Danger! The devil! What do you think me, General?"
17735,SCENE II,"'Tis the Duke's eye, and not his sword, I fear."
17736,SCENE II,
17737,SCENE II,_Butler._ What can his eye do to thee?
17738,SCENE II,
17739,SCENE II,_Devereux._                            Death and hell!
17740,SCENE II,"Thou know'st that I'm no milk-sop, General!"
17741,SCENE II,But 'tis not eight days since the Duke did send me                 100
17742,SCENE II,Twenty gold pieces for this good warm coat
17743,SCENE II,Which I have on! and then for him to see me
17744,SCENE II,"Standing before him with the pike, his murderer,"
17745,SCENE II,That eye of his looking upon this coat--
17746,SCENE II,Why--why--the devil fetch me! I'm no milk-sop!                     105
17747,SCENE II,
17748,SCENE II,"_Butler._ The Duke presented thee this good warm coat,"
17749,SCENE II,"And thou, a needy wight, hast pangs of conscience"
17750,SCENE II,To run him through the body in return.
17751,SCENE II,A coat that is far better and far warmer
17752,SCENE II,"Did the Emperor give to him, the Prince's mantle.                  110"
17753,SCENE II,"How doth he thank the Emperor? With revolt,"
17754,SCENE II,And treason.
17755,SCENE II,
17756,SCENE II,_Devereux._  That is true. The devil take
17757,SCENE II,Such thankers! I'll dispatch him.
17758,SCENE II,
17759,SCENE II,_Butler._                         And would'st quiet
17760,SCENE II,"Thy conscience, thou hast nought to do but simply"
17761,SCENE II,Pull off the coat; so canst thou do the deed                       115
17762,SCENE II,With light heart and good spirits.
17763,SCENE II,
17764,SCENE II,_Devereux._                        You are right.
17765,SCENE II,That did not strike me. I'll pull off the coat--
17766,SCENE II,So there's an end of it.
17767,SCENE II,
17768,SCENE II,"_Macdonald._             Yes, but there's another"
17769,SCENE II,Point to be thought of.
17770,SCENE II,
17771,SCENE II,"_Butler._               And what's that, Macdonald?"
17772,SCENE II,
17773,SCENE II,_Macdonald._ What avails sword or dagger against him?              120
17774,SCENE II,He is not to be wounded--he is--
17775,SCENE II,
17776,SCENE II,_Butler._                        What?
17777,SCENE II,
17778,SCENE II,"_Macdonald._ Safe against shot, and stab and flash! Hard frozen,"
17779,SCENE II,"Secured, and warranted by the black art!"
17780,SCENE II,"His body is impenetrable, I tell you."
17781,SCENE II,
17782,SCENE II,_Devereux._ In Inglestadt there was just such another--            125
17783,SCENE II,His whole skin was the same as steel; at last
17784,SCENE II,We were obliged to beat him down with gunstocks.
17785,SCENE II,
17786,SCENE II,_Macdonald._ Hear what I'll do.
17787,SCENE II,
17788,SCENE II,_Devereux._                     Well?
17789,SCENE II,
17790,SCENE II,_Macdonald._                          In the cloister here
17791,SCENE II,"There's a Dominican, my countryman."
17792,SCENE II,I'll make him dip my sword and pike for me                         130
17793,SCENE II,"In holy water, and say over them"
17794,SCENE II,One of his strongest blessings. That's probatum!
17795,SCENE II,Nothing can stand 'gainst that.
17796,SCENE II,
17797,SCENE II,"_Butler._                       So do, Macdonald!"
17798,SCENE II,But now go and select from out the regiment
17799,SCENE II,"Twenty or thirty able-bodied fellows,                              135"
17800,SCENE II,And let them take the oaths to the Emperor.
17801,SCENE II,"Then when it strikes eleven, when the first rounds"
17802,SCENE II,"Are passed, conduct them silently as may be"
17803,SCENE II,To the house--I will myself be not far off.
17804,SCENE II,
17805,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ But how do we get through Hartschier and Gordon,       140"
17806,SCENE II,That stand on guard there in the inner chamber?
17807,SCENE II,
17808,SCENE II,_Butler._ I have made myself acquainted with the place.
17809,SCENE II,I lead you through a back-door that's defended
17810,SCENE II,By one man only. Me my rank and office
17811,SCENE II,Give access to the Duke at every hour.                             145
17812,SCENE II,I'll go before you--with one poniard-stroke
17813,SCENE II,"Cut Hartschier's wind-pipe, and make way for you."
17814,SCENE II,
17815,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ And when we are there, by what means shall we gain"
17816,SCENE II,"The Duke's bed-chamber, without his alarming"
17817,SCENE II,The servants of the Court; for he has here                         150
17818,SCENE II,A numerous company of followers?
17819,SCENE II,
17820,SCENE II,"_Butler._ The attendants fill the right wing; he hates bustle,"
17821,SCENE II,And lodges in the left wing quite alone.
17822,SCENE II,
17823,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ Were it well over--hey, Macdonald? I"
17824,SCENE II,"Feel queerly on the occasion, devil knows!                         155"
17825,SCENE II,
17826,SCENE II,_Macdonald._ And I too. 'Tis too great a personage.
17827,SCENE II,People will hold us for a brace of villains.
17828,SCENE II,
17829,SCENE II,"_Butler._ In plenty, honour, splendour--You may safely"
17830,SCENE II,Laugh at the people's babble.
17831,SCENE II,
17832,SCENE II,_Devereux._                   If the business
17833,SCENE II,Squares with one's honour--if that be quite certain--              160
17834,SCENE II,
17835,SCENE II,_Butler._ Set your hearts quite at ease. Ye save for Ferdinand
17836,SCENE II,His Crown and Empire. The reward can be
17837,SCENE II,No small one.
17838,SCENE II,
17839,SCENE II,_Devereux._ And 'tis his purpose to dethrone the Emperor?
17840,SCENE II,
17841,SCENE II,_Butler._ Yes!--Yes!--to rob him of his crown and life.            165
17842,SCENE II,
17843,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ And he must fall by the executioner's hands,"
17844,SCENE II,Should we deliver him up to the Emperor
17845,SCENE II,Alive?
17846,SCENE II,
17847,SCENE II,_Butler._ It were his certain destiny.
17848,SCENE II,
17849,SCENE II,"_Devereux._ Well! Well! Come then, Macdonald, he shall not"
17850,SCENE II,Lie long in pain.                                                  170

17891,SCENE III,_Countess._                             She seems to have
17892,SCENE III,Foreboded some misfortune. The report
17893,SCENE III,"Of an engagement, in the which had fallen"
17894,SCENE III,"A colonel of the Imperial army, frighten'd her."
17895,SCENE III,I saw it instantly. She flew to meet                                 5
17896,SCENE III,"The Swedish Courier, and with sudden questioning,"
17897,SCENE III,Soon wrested from him the disastrous secret.

17909,SCENE III,_Duchess._                Her eyes are opening.
17910,SCENE III,
17911,SCENE III,_Countess._ She lives.
17912,SCENE III,
17913,SCENE III,_Thekla (looking around her)._ Where am I?
17914,SCENE III,
17915,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein (steps to her, raising her up in his arms)._ Come,"
17916,SCENE III,"cheerly, Thekla! be my own brave girl!"
17917,SCENE III,"See, there's thy loving mother. Thou art in                         15"
17918,SCENE III,Thy father's arms.
17919,SCENE III,
17920,SCENE III,_Thekla (standing up)._ Where is he? Is he gone?
17921,SCENE III,
17922,SCENE III,"_Duchess._ Who gone, my daughter?"
17923,SCENE III,
17924,SCENE III,_Thekla._                         He--the man who uttered
17925,SCENE III,That word of misery.
17926,SCENE III,
17927,SCENE III,"_Duchess._           O! think not of it,"
17928,SCENE III,My Thekla!
17929,SCENE III,
17930,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Give her sorrow leave to talk!
17931,SCENE III,"Let her complain--mingle your tears with hers,                      20"
17932,SCENE III,For she hath suffered a deep anguish; but
17933,SCENE III,"She'll rise superior to it, for my Thekla"
17934,SCENE III,Hath all her father's unsubdued heart.
17935,SCENE III,
17936,SCENE III,"_Thekla._ I am not ill. See, I have power to stand."
17937,SCENE III,Why does my mother weep? Have I alarmed her?                        25
17938,SCENE III,It is gone by--I recollect myself--
17939,SCENE III,
17940,SCENE III,"[_She casts her eyes round the room, as seeking some one._"
17941,SCENE III,
17942,SCENE III,"Where is he? Please you, do not hide him from me."
17943,SCENE III,You see I have strength enough: now I will hear him.
17944,SCENE III,
17945,SCENE III,"_Duchess._ No, never shall this messenger of evil"
17946,SCENE III,"Enter again into thy presence, Thekla!                              30"
17947,SCENE III,
17948,SCENE III,_Thekla._ My father--
17949,SCENE III,
17950,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._        Dearest daughter!
17951,SCENE III,
17952,SCENE III,_Thekla._                               I'm not weak--
17953,SCENE III,Shortly I shall be quite myself again.
17954,SCENE III,You'll grant me one request?
17955,SCENE III,
17956,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein._               Name it, my daughter."
17957,SCENE III,
17958,SCENE III,"_Thekla._ Permit the stranger to be called to me,"
17959,SCENE III,"And grant me leave, that by myself I may                            35"
17960,SCENE III,Hear his report and question him.
17961,SCENE III,
17962,SCENE III,"_Duchess._                        No, never!"
17963,SCENE III,
17964,SCENE III,_Countess._ 'Tis not advisable--assent not to it.
17965,SCENE III,
17966,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein._ Hush! Wherefore would'st thou speak with him, my"
17967,SCENE III,daughter?
17968,SCENE III,
17969,SCENE III,"_Thekla._ Knowing the whole, I shall be more collected;"
17970,SCENE III,I will not be deceived. My mother wishes                            40
17971,SCENE III,Only to spare me. I will not be spared.
17972,SCENE III,The worst is said already: I can hear
17973,SCENE III,Nothing of deeper anguish!
17974,SCENE III,
17975,SCENE III,_Countess and Duchess._    Do it not.
17976,SCENE III,
17977,SCENE III,_Thekla._ The horror overpowered me by surprise.
17978,SCENE III,My heart betrayed me in the stranger's presence;                    45
17979,SCENE III,"He was a witness of my weakness, yea,"
17980,SCENE III,I sank into his arms; and that has shamed me.
17981,SCENE III,"I must replace myself in his esteem,"
17982,SCENE III,"And I must speak with him, perforce, that he,"
17983,SCENE III,"The stranger, may not think ungently of me.                         50"
17984,SCENE III,
17985,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein._ I see she is in the right, and am inclined"
17986,SCENE III,"To grant her this request of hers. Go, call him."
17987,SCENE III,
17988,SCENE III,[_LADY NEUBRUNN goes to call him._
17989,SCENE III,
17990,SCENE III,"_Duchess._ But I, thy mother, will be present--"
17991,SCENE III,
17992,SCENE III,_Thekla._                                       'Twere
17993,SCENE III,"More pleasing to me, if alone I saw him:"
17994,SCENE III,"Trust me, I shall behave myself the more                            55"
17995,SCENE III,Collectedly.
17996,SCENE III,
17997,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Permit her her own will.
17998,SCENE III,"Leave her alone with him: for there are sorrows,"
17999,SCENE III,Where of necessity the soul must be
18000,SCENE III,Its own support. A strong heart will rely
18001,SCENE III,"On its own strength alone. In her own bosom,                        60"
18002,SCENE III,"Not in her mother's arms, must she collect"
18003,SCENE III,The strength to rise superior to this blow.
18004,SCENE III,It is mine own brave girl. I'll have her treated
18005,SCENE III,"Not as the woman, but the heroine.                    [_Going._"
18006,SCENE III,
18007,SCENE III,_Countess (detaining him)._ Where art thou going? I heard Tertsky
18008,SCENE III,say                                                             65
18009,SCENE III,That 'tis thy purpose to depart from hence
18010,SCENE III,"To-morrow early, but to leave us here."
18011,SCENE III,
18012,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein._ Yes, ye stay here, placed under the protection"
18013,SCENE III,Of gallant men.
18014,SCENE III,
18015,SCENE III,"_Countess._     O take us with you, brother."
18016,SCENE III,Leave us not in this gloomy solitude                                70
18017,SCENE III,To brood o'er anxious thoughts. The mists of doubt
18018,SCENE III,Magnify evils to a shape of horror.
18019,SCENE III,
18020,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein._ Who speaks of evil? I entreat you, sister,"
18021,SCENE III,Use words of better omen.
18022,SCENE III,
18023,SCENE III,_Countess._               Then take us with you.
18024,SCENE III,O leave us not behind you in a place                                75
18025,SCENE III,That forces us to such sad omens. Heavy
18026,SCENE III,And sick within me is my heart----
18027,SCENE III,"These walls breathe on me, like a church-yard vault."
18028,SCENE III,"I cannot tell you, brother, how this place"
18029,SCENE III,Doth go against my nature. Take us with you.                        80
18030,SCENE III,"Come, sister, join you your entreaty!--Niece,"
18031,SCENE III,"Yours too. We all entreat you, take us with you!"
18032,SCENE III,
18033,SCENE III,"_Wallenstein._ The place's evil omens will I change,"
18034,SCENE III,Making it that which shields and shelters for me
18035,SCENE III,My best beloved.
18036,SCENE III,
18037,SCENE III,_Lady Neubrunn (returning)._ The Swedish officer.                   85
18038,SCENE III,
18039,SCENE III,_Wallenstein._ Leave her alone with him.               [_Exit._
18040,SCENE III,
18041,SCENE III,_Duchess (to Thekla who starts and shivers)._ There--pale as
18042,SCENE III,"death!--Child, 'tis impossible"
18043,SCENE III,That thou should'st speak with him. Follow thy mother.
18044,SCENE III,
18045,SCENE III,_Thekla._ The Lady Neubrunn then may stay with me.

18062,SCENE IV,My inconsiderate rash speech--How could I--
18063,SCENE IV,
18064,SCENE IV,_Thekla._ You did behold me in my agony.
18065,SCENE IV,A most distressful accident occasioned
18066,SCENE IV,You from a stranger to become at once                                5
18067,SCENE IV,My confidant.
18068,SCENE IV,
18069,SCENE IV,"_Captain._    I fear you hate my presence,"
18070,SCENE IV,For my tongue spake a melancholy word.
18071,SCENE IV,
18072,SCENE IV,_Thekla._ The fault is mine. Myself did wrest it from you.
18073,SCENE IV,The horror which came o'er me interrupted

18079,SCENE IV,
18080,SCENE IV,_Thekla._           I am firm.----
18081,SCENE IV,I will be firm. Well--how began the engagement?
18082,SCENE IV,
18083,SCENE IV,"_Captain._ We lay, expecting no attack, at Neustadt,"
18084,SCENE IV,"Entrenched but insecurely in our camp,                              15"
18085,SCENE IV,When towards evening rose a cloud of dust
18086,SCENE IV,From the wood thitherward; our vanguard fled
18087,SCENE IV,"Into the camp, and sounded the alarm."
18088,SCENE IV,"Scarce had we mounted, ere the Pappenheimers,"
18089,SCENE IV,"Their horses at full speed, broke through the lines,                20"
18090,SCENE IV,And leapt the trenches; but their heedless courage
18091,SCENE IV,Had borne them onward far before the others--
18092,SCENE IV,"The infantry were still at distance, only"
18093,SCENE IV,The Pappenheimers followed daringly
18094,SCENE IV,Their daring leader----

18100,SCENE IV,With our whole cavalry we now received them;
18101,SCENE IV,"Back to the trenches drove them, where the foot"
18102,SCENE IV,Stretched out a solid ridge of pikes to meet them.
18103,SCENE IV,"They neither could advance, nor yet retreat;"
18104,SCENE IV,"And as they stood on every side wedged in,                          30"
18105,SCENE IV,"The Rhinegrave to their leader called aloud,"
18106,SCENE IV,"Inviting a surrender; but their leader,"
18107,SCENE IV,"Young Piccolomini----      [_THEKLA, as giddy, grasps a chair._"
18108,SCENE IV,"Known by his plume,"
18109,SCENE IV,"And his long hair, gave signal for the trenches;"
18110,SCENE IV,"Himself leapt first, the regiment all plunged after.                35"

18125,SCENE IV,_Thekla._                                 'Tis over.
18126,SCENE IV,Proceed to the conclusion.
18127,SCENE IV,
18128,SCENE IV,_Captain._                 Wild despair                             40
18129,SCENE IV,Inspired the troops with frenzy when they saw
18130,SCENE IV,Their leader perish; every thought of rescue
18131,SCENE IV,Was spurn'd; they fought like wounded tigers; their
18132,SCENE IV,Frantic resistance rous'd our soldiery;
18133,SCENE IV,"A murderous fight took place, nor was the contest                   45"
18134,SCENE IV,Finish'd before their last man fell.
18135,SCENE IV,
18136,SCENE IV,_Thekla._                            And where----
18137,SCENE IV,Where is--You have not told me all.
18138,SCENE IV,
18139,SCENE IV,_Captain (after a pause)._          This morning
18140,SCENE IV,We buried him. Twelve youths of noblest birth
18141,SCENE IV,Did bear him to interment; the whole army
18142,SCENE IV,Followed the bier. A laurel decked his coffin;                      50
18143,SCENE IV,"The sword of the deceased was placed upon it,"
18144,SCENE IV,"In mark of honour, by the Rhinegrave's self."
18145,SCENE IV,Nor tears were wanting; for there are among us
18146,SCENE IV,"Many, who had themselves experienced"
18147,SCENE IV,"The greatness of his mind, and gentle manners;                      55"
18148,SCENE IV,All were affected at his fate. The Rhinegrave
18149,SCENE IV,Would willingly have saved him; but himself
18150,SCENE IV,Made vain the attempt--'tis said he wished to die.
18151,SCENE IV,
18152,SCENE IV,"_Neubrunn (to Thekla who has hidden her countenance)._ Look up, my"

18155,SCENE IV,_Thekla._            Where is his grave?
18156,SCENE IV,
18157,SCENE IV,"_Captain._ At Neustadt, lady; in a cloister church                  60"
18158,SCENE IV,"Are his remains deposited, until"
18159,SCENE IV,We can receive directions from his father.
18160,SCENE IV,
18161,SCENE IV,_Thekla._ What is the cloister's name?
18162,SCENE IV,
18163,SCENE IV,_Captain._                             Saint Catharine's.
18164,SCENE IV,
18165,SCENE IV,_Thekla._ And how far is it thither?
18166,SCENE IV,
18167,SCENE IV,_Captain._                           Near twelve leagues.
18168,SCENE IV,
18169,SCENE IV,_Thekla._ And which the way?
18170,SCENE IV,
18171,SCENE IV,_Captain._                   You go by Tirschenreit                 65

18513,SCENE I,A boding fear possesses me!
18514,SCENE I,

18533,SCENE I,"In thy own chamber. As I entered, lo!"
18534,SCENE I,It was no more a chamber; the Chartreuse
18535,SCENE I,"At Gitschin 'twas, which thou thyself hast founded,                 90"
18536,SCENE I,And where it is thy will that thou should'st be

18542,SCENE I,A voice of warning speaks prophetic to us?
18543,SCENE I,
18544,SCENE I,_Wallenstein._ There is no doubt that there exist such voices.      95
18545,SCENE I,Yet I would not call them

18560,SCENE I,Sounded that coronation festival;
18561,SCENE I,And still with boding sense he heard the tread

18564,SCENE I,

18576,SCENE I,When on a sudden did I feel myself
18577,SCENE I,Grasped from behind--the hand was cold that grasped me--
18578,SCENE I,"'Twas thou, and thou did'st kiss me, and there seemed"
18579,SCENE I,A crimson covering to envelop us.

18590,SCENE I,

19478,PREFACE,This Tragedy was written in the summer and autumn of the year 1797; at
19479,PREFACE,"Nether Stowey, in the county of Somerset. By whose recommendation, and"
19480,PREFACE,of the manner in which both the Play and the Author were treated by the
19481,PREFACE,"Recommender, let me be permitted to relate: that I knew of its having"
19482,PREFACE,been received only by a third person; that I could procure neither
19483,PREFACE,answer nor the manuscript; and that but for an accident I should have
19484,PREFACE,had no copy of the Work itself. That such treatment would damp a young
19485,PREFACE,man's exertions may be easily conceived: there was no need of
19486,PREFACE,"after-misrepresentation and calumny, as an additional sedative."
19487,PREFACE,
19488,PREFACE,"[812:2][As an amusing anecdote, and in the wish to prepare future"
19489,PREFACE,"Authors, as young as I then was and as ignorant of the world, of[812:3]"
19490,PREFACE,"the treatment they may meet with, I will add, that the Person[812:4] who"
19491,PREFACE,by a twice conveyed recommendation (in the year 1797) had urged me to
19492,PREFACE,write a Tragedy[812:5]: who on my own objection that I was utterly
19493,PREFACE,ignorant of all Stage-tactics had promised that _he_ would himself make
19494,PREFACE,"the necessary alterations, if the Piece should be at all representable;"
19495,PREFACE,who together with the copy of the Play (hastened by his means so as to
19496,PREFACE,prevent the full developement[812:6] of the characters) received a
19497,PREFACE,"letter from the Author to this purport, '_that conscious of his"
19498,PREFACE,"inexperience, he had cherished no expectations, and should therefore"
19499,PREFACE,feel no disappointment from the rejection of the Play; but that if
19500,PREFACE,beyond his hopes Mr. ---- found in it any capability of being adapted to
19501,PREFACE,"the Stage, it was delivered to him as if it had been his own Manuscript,"
19502,PREFACE,"to add, omit, or alter, as he saw occasion; and that (if it were"
19503,PREFACE,rejected) the Author would deem himself amply remunerated by the
19504,PREFACE,"addition to his Experience, which he should receive, if Mr. ----would"
19505,PREFACE,point out[812:7] to him the nature of its unfitness for public
19506,PREFACE,"Representation_';--that this very Person returned[813:1] me no answer,"
19507,PREFACE,"and[813:2], spite of repeated applications, retained my Manuscript when"
19508,PREFACE,I was not conscious of any other Copy being in existence (my duplicate
19509,PREFACE,having been destroyed by an accident); that he[813:3] suffered this
19510,PREFACE,"Manuscript to wander about the Town from his house, so that but ten days"
19511,PREFACE,"ago I saw[813:4] the song in the third Act _printed_ and set to music,"
19512,PREFACE,"without my name, by Mr. Carnaby, in the year 1802; likewise that the"
19513,PREFACE,same person asserted[813:5] (as I have been assured) that the Play was
19514,PREFACE,"rejected, because I would not submit to the alteration of one ludicrous"
19515,PREFACE,line; and finally[813:6] in the year 1806 amused and delighted (as who
19516,PREFACE,"was ever in his company, if I may trust the universal report, without"
19517,PREFACE,being amused and delighted?) a large company at the house of a highly
19518,PREFACE,"respectable Member of Parliament, with the ridicule of the[813:7]"

19540,PREFACE,"Mr. Whitbread, requesting information as to whom I was to present my"
19541,PREFACE,"Tragedy. My Letter was instantly and most kindly answered, and I have"
19542,PREFACE,now nothing to tell but a Tale of Thanks. I should scarce know where to
19543,PREFACE,"begin, if the goodness of the Manager, Mr. ARNOLD, had not called for my"
19544,PREFACE,"first acknowledgements. Not merely as an _acting Play_, but as a"
19545,PREFACE,"dramatic _Poem_, the 'REMORSE' has been importantly and manifoldly"
19546,PREFACE,"benefited by his suggestions. I can with severest truth say, that every"
19547,PREFACE,hint he gave me was the ground of some improvement. In the next place it
19548,PREFACE,"is my duty to mention Mr. RAYMOND, the Stage Manager. Had the 'REMORSE'"
19549,PREFACE,"been his own Play--nay, that is saying too little--had I been his"
19550,PREFACE,"brother, or his dearest friend, he could not have felt or exerted"
19551,PREFACE,himself more zealously.
19552,PREFACE,
19553,PREFACE,"As the Piece is now acting, it may be thought presumptuous in me to"
19554,PREFACE,"speak of the Actors; yet how can I abstain, feeling, as I do, Mrs."

19557,PREFACE,"will come, when without painfully oppressing her feelings, I may speak"
19558,PREFACE,"of this more fully. To Miss SMITH I have an equal, though different"
19559,PREFACE,"acknowledgement to make, namely, for her acceptance of a character not"
19560,PREFACE,"fully developed, and quite inadequate to her extraordinary powers. She"
19561,PREFACE,"enlivened and supported many passages, which (though not perhaps wholly"
19562,PREFACE,uninteresting in the closet) would but for her have hung heavy on the
19563,PREFACE,"ears of a Theatrical Audience. And in speaking the Epilogue, a"
19564,PREFACE,"composition which (I fear) my hurry will hardly excuse, and which, as"
19565,PREFACE,"unworthy of her name, is here [1828, 1829, 1834] omitted, she made a"
19566,PREFACE,"sacrifice, which only her established character with all judges of"
19567,PREFACE,"Tragic action, could have rendered compatible with her duty to herself."
19568,PREFACE,To Mr. DE CAMP'S judgement and full conception of Isidore; to Mr. POPE'S
19569,PREFACE,"accurate representation of the partial, yet honourable Father; to Mr."
19570,PREFACE,"ELLISTON'S energy in the character of ALVAR, and who in more than one"
19571,PREFACE,"instance _gave_ it beauties and striking points, which not only"
19572,PREFACE,"delighted but surprised me; and to Mr. RAE[815:1], to whose zeal, and"
19573,PREFACE,"unwearied study of his part, I am not less indebted as a _Man_, than to"
19574,PREFACE,"his impassioned realization of ORDONIO, as an _Author_;----to these, and"
19575,PREFACE,"to all concerned with the bringing out of the Play, I can address but"
19576,PREFACE,one word--THANKS!--but that word is uttered sincerely! and to persons
19577,PREFACE,"constantly before the eye of the Public, a public acknowledgement"

20014,SCENE I,The fulness of my anguish by degrees

20039,SCENE I,"If possible, alone too. This was her wonted walk,"
20040,SCENE I,"And this the hour; her words, her very looks"

20158,SCENE II,"To trick out mine own death-bed, and imagine"
20159,SCENE II,"That I had died, died just ere his return!"
20160,SCENE II,"Then see him listening to my constancy,"
20161,SCENE II,"Or hover round, as he at midnight oft                               40"
20162,SCENE II,Sits on my grave and gazes at the moon;
20163,SCENE II,"Or haply in some more fantastic mood,"
20164,SCENE II,"To be in Paradise, and with choice flowers"
20165,SCENE II,"Build up a bower where he and I might dwell,"
20166,SCENE II,And there to wait his coming! O my sire!                            45
20167,SCENE II,My Alvar's sire! if this be wretchedness
20168,SCENE II,"That eats away the life, what were it, think you,"
20169,SCENE II,If in a most assured reality
20170,SCENE II,"He should return, and see a brother's infant"
20171,SCENE II,Smile at him from my arms?                                          50
20172,SCENE II,Oh what a thought!
20173,SCENE II,
20174,SCENE II,_Valdez._ A thought? even so! mere thought! an empty thought.
20175,SCENE II,The very week he promised his return----
20176,SCENE II,
20177,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ Was it not then a busy joy? to see him,"
20178,SCENE II,After those three years' travels! we had no fears--                 55
20179,SCENE II,"The frequent tidings, the ne'er failing letter."
20180,SCENE II,"Almost endeared his absence! Yet the gladness,"
20181,SCENE II,The tumult of our joy! What then if now----
20182,SCENE II,
20183,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ O power of youth to feed on pleasant thoughts,"
20184,SCENE II,Spite of conviction! I am old and heartless!                        60
20185,SCENE II,"Yes, I am old--I have no pleasant fancies--"
20186,SCENE II,Hectic and unrefreshed with rest--
20187,SCENE II,
20188,SCENE II,_Teresa._                          My father!
20189,SCENE II,
20190,SCENE II,_Valdez._ The sober truth is all too much for me!
20191,SCENE II,I see no sail which brings not to my mind
20192,SCENE II,The home-bound bark in which my son was captured                    65
20193,SCENE II,By the Algerine--to perish with his captors!
20194,SCENE II,
20195,SCENE II,_Teresa._ Oh no! he did not!
20196,SCENE II,
20197,SCENE II,_Valdez_.                    Captured in sight of land!
20198,SCENE II,"From yon hill point, nay, from our castle watch-tower"
20199,SCENE II,We might have seen----
20200,SCENE II,
20201,SCENE II,"_Teresa._              His capture, not his death."
20202,SCENE II,
20203,SCENE II,_Valdez._ Alas! how aptly thou forget'st a tale                     70
20204,SCENE II,Thou ne'er didst wish to learn! my brave Ordonio
20205,SCENE II,"Saw both the pirate and his prize go down,"
20206,SCENE II,"In the same storm that baffled his own valour,"
20207,SCENE II,And thus twice snatched a brother from his hopes:
20208,SCENE II,"Gallant Ordonio! O beloved Teresa,                                  75"
20209,SCENE II,"Would'st thou best prove thy faith to generous Alvar,"
20210,SCENE II,"And most delight his spirit, go, make thou"
20211,SCENE II,"His brother happy, make his aged father"
20212,SCENE II,Sink to the grave in joy.
20213,SCENE II,
20214,SCENE II,_Teresa._                 For mercy's sake
20215,SCENE II,Press me no more! I have no power to love him.                      80
20216,SCENE II,"His proud forbidding eye, and his dark brow,"
20217,SCENE II,Chill me like dew-damps of the unwholesome night:
20218,SCENE II,"My love, a timorous and tender flower,"
20219,SCENE II,Closes beneath his touch.
20220,SCENE II,
20221,SCENE II,"_Valdez._                 You wrong him, maiden!"
20222,SCENE II,"You wrong him, by my soul! Nor was it well                          85"
20223,SCENE II,To character by such unkindly phrases
20224,SCENE II,The stir and workings of that love for you
20225,SCENE II,"Which he has toiled to smother. 'Twas not well,"
20226,SCENE II,Nor is it grateful in you to forget
20227,SCENE II,"His wounds and perilous voyages, and how                            90"
20228,SCENE II,With an heroic fearlessness of danger
20229,SCENE II,He roam'd the coast of Afric for your Alvar.
20230,SCENE II,It was not well--You have moved me even to tears.
20231,SCENE II,
20232,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ Oh pardon me, Lord Valdez! pardon me!"
20233,SCENE II,"It was a foolish and ungrateful speech,                             95"
20234,SCENE II,A most ungrateful speech! But I am hurried
20235,SCENE II,"Beyond myself, if I but hear of one"
20236,SCENE II,Who aims to rival Alvar. Were we not
20237,SCENE II,"Born in one day, like twins of the same parent?"
20238,SCENE II,"Nursed in one cradle? Pardon me, my father!                        100"
20239,SCENE II,"A six years' absence is a heavy thing,"
20240,SCENE II,Yet still the hope survives----
20241,SCENE II,
20242,SCENE II,_Valdez (looking forward)._ Hush! 'tis Monviedro.
20243,SCENE II,
20244,SCENE II,_Teresa._ The Inquisitor! on what new scent of blood?
20245,SCENE II,
20246,SCENE II,_Enter MONVIEDRO with ALHADRA._
20247,SCENE II,
20248,SCENE II,"_Monviedro._ Peace and the truth be with you! Good my Lord,        105"
20249,SCENE II,My present need is with your son.
20250,SCENE II,"We have hit the time. Here comes he! Yes, 'tis he."
20251,SCENE II,
20252,SCENE II,[_Enter from the opposite side DON ORDONIO._
20253,SCENE II,
20254,SCENE II,"My Lord Ordonio, this Moresco woman"
20255,SCENE II,(Alhadra is her name) asks audience of you.
20256,SCENE II,
20257,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ Hail, reverend father! what may be the business?        110"
20258,SCENE II,
20259,SCENE II,"_Monviedro._ My lord, on strong suspicion of relapse"
20260,SCENE II,"To his false creed, so recently abjured,"
20261,SCENE II,The secret servants of the Inquisition
20262,SCENE II,"Have seized her husband, and at my command"
20263,SCENE II,"To the supreme tribunal would have led him,                        115"
20264,SCENE II,"But that he made appeal to you, my lord,"
20265,SCENE II,As surety for his soundness in the faith.
20266,SCENE II,Though lessoned by experience what small trust
20267,SCENE II,"The asseverations of these Moors deserve,"
20268,SCENE II,"Yet still the deference to Ordonio's name,                         120"
20269,SCENE II,"Nor less the wish to prove, with what high honour"
20270,SCENE II,"The Holy Church regards her faithful soldiers,"
20271,SCENE II,Thus far prevailed with me that----
20272,SCENE II,
20273,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._                          Reverend father,"
20274,SCENE II,"I am much beholden to your high opinion,"
20275,SCENE II,Which so o'erprizes my light services.      [_Then to ALHADRA._    125
20276,SCENE II,I would that I could serve you; but in truth
20277,SCENE II,Your face is new to me.
20278,SCENE II,
20279,SCENE II,_Monviedro._            My mind foretold me
20280,SCENE II,"That such would be the event. In truth, Lord Valdez,"
20281,SCENE II,"'Twas little probable, that Don Ordonio,"
20282,SCENE II,"That your illustrious son, who fought so bravely                   130"
20283,SCENE II,"Some four years since to quell these rebel Moors,"
20284,SCENE II,Should prove the patron of this infidel!
20285,SCENE II,The warranter of a Moresco's faith!
20286,SCENE II,Now I return.
20287,SCENE II,
20288,SCENE II,"_Alhadra._ My Lord, my husband's name                              135"
20289,SCENE II,Is Isidore. (_ORDONIO starts._) You may remember it:
20290,SCENE II,"Three years ago, three years this very week,"
20291,SCENE II,You left him at Almeria.
20292,SCENE II,
20293,SCENE II,_Monviedro._             Palpably false!
20294,SCENE II,"This very week, three years ago, my lord,"
20295,SCENE II,(You needs must recollect it by your wound)                        140
20296,SCENE II,"You were at sea, and there engaged the pirates,"
20297,SCENE II,The murderers doubtless of your brother Alvar!
20298,SCENE II,"What, is he ill, my Lord? how strange he looks!"
20299,SCENE II,
20300,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ You pressed upon him too abruptly, father!"
20301,SCENE II,"The fate of one, on whom, you know, he doted.                      145"
20302,SCENE II,
20303,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ O Heavens! I?--I doted?
20304,SCENE II,Yes! I doted on him.
20305,SCENE II,
20306,SCENE II,"[_ORDONIO walks to the end of the stage, VALDEZ follows._"
20307,SCENE II,
20308,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ I do not, can not, love him. Is my heart hard?"
20309,SCENE II,Is my heart hard? that even now the thought
20310,SCENE II,Should force itself upon me?--Yet I feel it!                       150
20311,SCENE II,
20312,SCENE II,_Monviedro._ The drops did start and stand upon his forehead!
20313,SCENE II,"I will return. In very truth, I grieve"
20314,SCENE II,"To have been the occasion. Ho! attend me, woman!"
20315,SCENE II,
20316,SCENE II,"_Alhadra (to Teresa)._ O gentle lady! make the father stay,"
20317,SCENE II,"Until my lord recover. I am sure,                                  155"
20318,SCENE II,That he will say he is my husband's friend.
20319,SCENE II,
20320,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ Stay, father! stay! my lord will soon recover."
20321,SCENE II,
20322,SCENE II,"_Ordonio (as they return, to Valdez)._ Strange, that this Monviedro"
20323,SCENE II,Should have the power so to distemper me!
20324,SCENE II,
20325,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ Nay, 'twas an amiable weakness, son!                     160"
20326,SCENE II,
20327,SCENE II,"_Monviedro._ My lord, I truly grieve----"
20328,SCENE II,
20329,SCENE II,_Ordonio._                               Tut! name it not.
20330,SCENE II,"A sudden seizure, father! think not of it."
20331,SCENE II,"As to this woman's husband, I do know him."
20332,SCENE II,"I know him well, and that he is a Christian."
20333,SCENE II,
20334,SCENE II,"_Monviedro._ I hope, my lord, your merely human pity               165"
20335,SCENE II,Doth not prevail----
20336,SCENE II,
20337,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ 'Tis certain that he was a catholic;
20338,SCENE II,"What changes may have happened in three years,"
20339,SCENE II,"I can not say; but grant me this, good father:"
20340,SCENE II,"Myself I'll sift him: if I find him sound,                         170"
20341,SCENE II,You'll grant me your authority and name
20342,SCENE II,To liberate his house.
20343,SCENE II,
20344,SCENE II,"_Monviedro._           Your zeal, my lord,"
20345,SCENE II,And your late merits in this holy warfare
20346,SCENE II,Would authorize an ampler trust--you have it.
20347,SCENE II,
20348,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ I will attend you home within an hour.                  175
20349,SCENE II,
20350,SCENE II,_Valdez._ Meantime return with us and take refreshment.
20351,SCENE II,
20352,SCENE II,_Alhadra_. Not till my husband's free! I may not do it.
20353,SCENE II,I will stay here.
20354,SCENE II,
20355,SCENE II,_Teresa (aside)._ Who is this Isidore?
20356,SCENE II,
20357,SCENE II,_Valdez._                              Daughter!
20358,SCENE II,
20359,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ With your permission, my dear lord,                      180"
20360,SCENE II,I'll loiter yet awhile t' enjoy the sea breeze.
20361,SCENE II,
20362,SCENE II,"[_Exeunt VALDEZ, MONVIEDRO and ORDONIO._"
20363,SCENE II,
20364,SCENE II,"_Alhadra._ Hah! there he goes! a bitter curse go with him,"
20365,SCENE II,A scathing curse!
20366,SCENE II,"You hate him, don't you, lady?"
20367,SCENE II,
20368,SCENE II,_Teresa._ Oh fear not me! my heart is sad for you.                 185
20369,SCENE II,
20370,SCENE II,_Alhadra._ These fell inquisitors! these sons of blood!
20371,SCENE II,"As I came on, his face so maddened me,"
20372,SCENE II,That ever and anon I clutched my dagger
20373,SCENE II,And half unsheathed it----
20374,SCENE II,
20375,SCENE II,"_Teresa._                  Be more calm, I pray you."
20376,SCENE II,
20377,SCENE II,_Alhadra._ And as he walked along the narrow path                  190
20378,SCENE II,"Close by the mountain's edge, my soul grew eager;"
20379,SCENE II,'Twas with hard toil I made myself remember
20380,SCENE II,That his Familiars held my babes and husband.
20381,SCENE II,"To have leapt upon him with a tiger's plunge,"
20382,SCENE II,"And hurl'd him down the rugged precipice,                          195"
20383,SCENE II,"O, it had been most sweet!"
20384,SCENE II,
20385,SCENE II,_Teresa._                  Hush! hush for shame!
20386,SCENE II,Where is your woman's heart?
20387,SCENE II,
20388,SCENE II,_Alhadra._                 O gentle lady!
20389,SCENE II,"You have no skill to guess my many wrongs,"
20390,SCENE II,"Many and strange! Besides, I am a Christian,"
20391,SCENE II,And Christians never pardon--'tis their faith!                     200
20392,SCENE II,
20393,SCENE II,_Teresa._ Shame fall on those who so have shewn it to thee!
20394,SCENE II,
20395,SCENE II,_Alhadra._ I know that man; 'tis well he knows not me.
20396,SCENE II,"Five years ago (and he was the prime agent),"
20397,SCENE II,Five years ago the holy brethren seized me.
20398,SCENE II,
20399,SCENE II,_Teresa._ What might your crime be?
20400,SCENE II,
20401,SCENE II,_Alhadra._                          I was a Moresco!               205
20402,SCENE II,"They cast me, then a young and nursing mother,"
20403,SCENE II,"Into a dungeon of their prison house,"
20404,SCENE II,"Where was no bed, no fire, no ray of light,"
20405,SCENE II,"No touch, no sound of comfort! The black air,"
20406,SCENE II,"It was a toil to breathe it! when the door,                        210"
20407,SCENE II,"Slow opening at the appointed hour, disclosed"
20408,SCENE II,"One human countenance, the lamp's red flame"
20409,SCENE II,"Cowered as it entered, and at once sank down."
20410,SCENE II,Oh miserable! by that lamp to see
20411,SCENE II,My infant quarrelling with the coarse hard bread                   215
20412,SCENE II,Brought daily; for the little wretch was sickly--
20413,SCENE II,My rage had dried away its natural food.[830:1]
20414,SCENE II,"In darkness I remained--the dull bell counting,"
20415,SCENE II,"Which haply told me, that the all-cheering sun"
20416,SCENE II,"Was rising on our garden. When I dozed,                            220"
20417,SCENE II,My infant's moanings mingled with my slumbers
20418,SCENE II,"And waked me.--If you were a mother, lady,"
20419,SCENE II,"I should scarce dare to tell you, that its noises"
20420,SCENE II,And peevish cries so fretted on my brain
20421,SCENE II,That I have struck the innocent babe in anger.                     225
20422,SCENE II,
20423,SCENE II,_Teresa._ O Heaven! it is too horrible to hear.
20424,SCENE II,
20425,SCENE II,_Alhadra._ What was it then to suffer? 'Tis most right
20426,SCENE II,"That such as you should hear it.--Know you not,"
20427,SCENE II,"What nature makes you mourn, she bids you heal?[830:2]"
20428,SCENE II,"Great evils ask great passions to redress them,                    230"
20429,SCENE II,And whirlwinds fitliest scatter pestilence.
20430,SCENE II,
20431,SCENE II,_Teresa._ You were at length released?
20432,SCENE II,
20433,SCENE II,"_Alhadra._                             Yes, at length"
20434,SCENE II,I saw the blessed arch of the whole heaven!
20435,SCENE II,'Twas the first time my infant smiled. No more--
20436,SCENE II,"For if I dwell upon that moment, Lady,                             235"
20437,SCENE II,A trance comes on which makes me o'er again
20438,SCENE II,"All I then was--my knees hang loose and drag,"
20439,SCENE II,"And my lip falls with such an idiot laugh,"
20440,SCENE II,That you would start and shudder!
20441,SCENE II,
20442,SCENE II,_Teresa._                         But your husband--
20443,SCENE II,
20444,SCENE II,"_Alhadra._ A month's imprisonment would kill him, Lady.            240"
20445,SCENE II,
20446,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ Alas, poor man!"
20447,SCENE II,
20448,SCENE II,"_Alhadra._                He hath a lion's courage,"
20449,SCENE II,"Fearless in act, but feeble in endurance;"
20450,SCENE II,"Unfit for boisterous times, with gentle heart"
20451,SCENE II,"He worships nature in the hill and valley,"
20452,SCENE II,"Not knowing what he loves, but loves it all--                      245"
20453,SCENE II,
20454,SCENE II,"_Enter ALVAR disguised as a Moresco, and in Moorish garments._"
20455,SCENE II,
20456,SCENE II,_Teresa._ Know you that stately Moor?
20457,SCENE II,
20458,SCENE II,_Alhadra._                            I know him not:
20459,SCENE II,"But doubt not he is some Moresco chieftain,"
20460,SCENE II,Who hides himself among the Alpujarras.
20461,SCENE II,
20462,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ The Alpujarras? Does he know his danger,"
20463,SCENE II,So near this seat?
20464,SCENE II,
20465,SCENE II,"_Alhadra._         He wears the Moorish robes too,                 250"
20466,SCENE II,As in defiance of the royal edict.
20467,SCENE II,
20468,SCENE II,"[_ALHADRA advances to ALVAR, who has walked to the back"
20469,SCENE II,"of the stage, near the rocks. TERESA drops her"
20470,SCENE II,veil._
20471,SCENE II,
20472,SCENE II,"_Alhadra._ Gallant Moresco! An inquisitor,"
20473,SCENE II,"Monviedro, of known hatred to our race----"
20474,SCENE II,
20475,SCENE II,_Alvar._ You have mistaken me. I am a Christian.
20476,SCENE II,
20477,SCENE II,"_Alhadra._ He deems, that we are plotting to ensnare him:          255"
20478,SCENE II,"Speak to him, Lady--none can hear you speak,"
20479,SCENE II,And not believe you innocent of guile.
20480,SCENE II,
20481,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ If aught enforce you to concealment, Sir--"
20482,SCENE II,
20483,SCENE II,_Alhadra._ He trembles strangely.
20484,SCENE II,
20485,SCENE II,[_ALVAR sinks down and hides his face in his robe._
20486,SCENE II,
20487,SCENE II,"_Teresa._                         See, we have disturbed him."
20488,SCENE II,
20489,SCENE II,[_Approaches nearer to him._
20490,SCENE II,
20491,SCENE II,"I pray you, think us friends--uncowl your face,                    260"
20492,SCENE II,"For you seem faint, and the night-breeze blows healing."
20493,SCENE II,"I pray you, think us friends!"
20494,SCENE II,
20495,SCENE II,"_Alvar (raising his head)._ Calm, very calm!"
20496,SCENE II,'Tis all too tranquil for reality!
20497,SCENE II,"And she spoke to me with her innocent voice,                       265"
20498,SCENE II,"That voice, that innocent voice! She is no traitress!"
20499,SCENE II,
20500,SCENE II,_Teresa._ Let us retire (_haughtily to Alhadra_).
20501,SCENE II,
20502,SCENE II,_Alhadra._ He is indeed a Christian.
20503,SCENE II,
20504,SCENE II,"_Alvar (aside)._ She deems me dead, yet wears no mourning garment!"
20505,SCENE II,Why should my brother's--wife--wear mourning garments?             270
20506,SCENE II,
20507,SCENE II,[_To TERESA._
20508,SCENE II,
20509,SCENE II,"Your pardon, noble dame! that I disturbed you:"
20510,SCENE II,I had just started from a frightful dream.
20511,SCENE II,
20512,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ Dreams tell but of the past, and yet, 'tis said,"
20513,SCENE II,They prophesy--
20514,SCENE II,
20515,SCENE II,_Alvar._        The Past lives o'er again
20516,SCENE II,"In its effects, and to the guilty spirit                           275"
20517,SCENE II,The ever-frowning Present is its image.
20518,SCENE II,
20519,SCENE II,_Teresa._ Traitress!                            (_Then aside._)
20520,SCENE II,What sudden spell o'ermasters me?
20521,SCENE II,"Why seeks he me, shunning the Moorish woman?"
20522,SCENE II,
20523,SCENE II,"_Alvar._ I dreamt I had a friend, on whom I leant"
20524,SCENE II,"With blindest trust, and a betroth√©d maid,                         280"
20525,SCENE II,"Whom I was wont to call not mine, but me:"
20526,SCENE II,"For mine own self seem'd nothing, lacking her."
20527,SCENE II,"This maid so idolized, that trusted friend"
20528,SCENE II,"Dishonoured in my absence, soul and body!"
20529,SCENE II,"Fear, following guilt, tempted to blacker guilt,                   285"
20530,SCENE II,And murderers were suborned against my life.
20531,SCENE II,"But by my looks, and most impassioned words,"
20532,SCENE II,"I roused the virtues that are dead in no man,"
20533,SCENE II,"Even in the assassins' hearts! they made their terms,"
20534,SCENE II,And thanked me for redeeming them from murder.                     290
20535,SCENE II,
20536,SCENE II,"_Alhadra._ You are lost in thought: hear him no more, sweet Lady!"
20537,SCENE II,
20538,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ From morn to night I am myself a dreamer,"
20539,SCENE II,And slight things bring on me the idle mood!
20540,SCENE II,"Well sir, what happened then?"
20541,SCENE II,
20542,SCENE II,"_Alvar._                      On a rude rock,"
20543,SCENE II,"A rock, methought, fast by a grove of firs,                        295"
20544,SCENE II,Whose thready leaves to the low-breathing gale
20545,SCENE II,"Made a soft sound most like the distant ocean,"
20546,SCENE II,"I stayed, as though the hour of death were passed,"
20547,SCENE II,And I were sitting in the world of spirits--
20548,SCENE II,For all things seemed unreal! There I sate--                       300
20549,SCENE II,"The dews fell clammy, and the night descended,"
20550,SCENE II,"Black, sultry, close! and ere the midnight hour"
20551,SCENE II,"A storm came on, mingling all sounds of fear,"
20552,SCENE II,"That woods, and sky, and mountains, seemed one havock."
20553,SCENE II,The second flash of lightning shewed a tree                        305
20554,SCENE II,"Hard by me, newly scathed. I rose tumultuous:"
20555,SCENE II,"My soul worked high, I bared my head to the storm,"
20556,SCENE II,"And with loud voice and clamorous agony,"
20557,SCENE II,"Kneeling I prayed to the great Spirit that made me,"
20558,SCENE II,"Prayed, that Remorse might fasten on their hearts,                 310"
20559,SCENE II,"And cling with poisonous tooth, inextricable"
20560,SCENE II,As the gored lion's bite!
20561,SCENE II,
20562,SCENE II,_Teresa._                 A fearful curse!
20563,SCENE II,
20564,SCENE II,_Alhadra._ But dreamt you not that you returned and killed them?
20565,SCENE II,Dreamt you of no revenge?
20566,SCENE II,
20567,SCENE II,_Alvar._                  She would have died
20568,SCENE II,Died in her guilt--perchance by her own hands!                     315
20569,SCENE II,"And bending o'er her self-inflicted wounds,"
20570,SCENE II,"I might have met the evil glance of frenzy,"
20571,SCENE II,And leapt myself into an unblest grave!
20572,SCENE II,I prayed for the punishment that cleanses hearts:
20573,SCENE II,For still I loved her!
20574,SCENE II,
20575,SCENE II,_Alhadra._             And you dreamt all this?                    320
20576,SCENE II,
20577,SCENE II,_Teresa._ My soul is full of visions all as wild!
20578,SCENE II,
20579,SCENE II,_Alhadra._ There is no room in this heart for puling love-tales.
20580,SCENE II,
20581,SCENE II,"_Teresa (lifts up her veil, and advances to Alvar)._ Stranger,"
20582,SCENE II,"farewell! I guess not who you are,"
20583,SCENE II,Nor why you so addressed your tale to me.
20584,SCENE II,"Your mien is noble, and, I own, perplexed me,                      325"
20585,SCENE II,"With obscure memory of something past,"
20586,SCENE II,"Which still escaped my efforts, or presented"
20587,SCENE II,Tricks of a fancy pampered with long wishing.
20588,SCENE II,"If, as it sometimes happens, our rude startling,"
20589,SCENE II,"Whilst your full heart was shaping out its dream,                  330"
20590,SCENE II,"Drove you to this, your not ungentle, wildness--"
20591,SCENE II,"You have my sympathy, and so farewell!"
20592,SCENE II,"But if some undiscovered wrongs oppress you,"
20593,SCENE II,"And you need strength to drag them into light,"
20594,SCENE II,"The generous Valdez, and my Lord Ordonio,                          335"
20595,SCENE II,"Have arm and will to aid a noble sufferer,"
20596,SCENE II,Nor shall you want my favourable pleading.[833:1]
20597,SCENE II,
20598,SCENE II,[_Exeunt TERESA and ALHADRA._
20599,SCENE II,
20600,SCENE II,_Alvar (alone)._ 'Tis strange! It cannot be! my Lord Ordonio!
20601,SCENE II,"Her Lord Ordonio! Nay, I will not do it!"
20602,SCENE II,I cursed him once--and one curse is enough!                        340
20603,SCENE II,"How sad she looked, and pale! but not like guilt--"
20604,SCENE II,And her calm tones--sweet as a song of mercy!
20605,SCENE II,"If the bad spirit retain'd his angel's voice,"
20606,SCENE II,Hell scarce were Hell. And why not innocent?
20607,SCENE II,"Who meant to murder me, might well cheat her?                      345"
20608,SCENE II,"But ere she married him, he had stained her honour;"
20609,SCENE II,Ah! there I am hampered. What if this were a lie
20610,SCENE II,"Framed by the assassin? Who should tell it him,"
20611,SCENE II,If it were truth? Ordonio would not tell him.
20612,SCENE II,"Yet why one lie? all else, I know, was truth.                      350"
20613,SCENE II,"No start, no jealousy of stirring conscience!"
20614,SCENE II,"And she referred to me--fondly, methought!"
20615,SCENE II,Could she walk here if she had been a traitress?
20616,SCENE II,Here where we played together in our childhood?
20617,SCENE II,Here where we plighted vows? where her cold cheek                  355
20618,SCENE II,"Received my last kiss, when with suppressed feelings"
20619,SCENE II,She had fainted in my arms? It cannot be!
20620,SCENE II,"'Tis not in nature! I will die believing,"
20621,SCENE II,"That I shall meet her where no evil is,"
20622,SCENE II,"No treachery, no cup dashed from the lips.                         360"
20623,SCENE II,I'll haunt this scene no more! live she in peace!
20624,SCENE II,Her husband--aye her husband! May this angel
20625,SCENE II,"New mould his canker'd heart! Assist me, heaven,"
20626,SCENE II,That I may pray for my poor guilty brother!            [_Exit._

20812,SCENE I,That over-brows it! Patron! Friend! Preserver!                       5
20813,SCENE I,Thrice have you saved my life. Once in the battle
20814,SCENE I,You gave it me: next rescued me from suicide
20815,SCENE I,"When for my follies I was made to wander,"
20816,SCENE I,"With mouths to feed, and not a morsel for them:"
20817,SCENE I,"Now but for you, a dungeon's slimy stones                           10"
20818,SCENE I,Had been my bed and pillow.
20819,SCENE I,
20820,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                  Good Isidore!
20821,SCENE I,"Why this to me? It is enough, you know it."
20822,SCENE I,
20823,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ A common trick of gratitude, my lord,"
20824,SCENE I,Seeking to ease her own full heart----
20825,SCENE I,
20826,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                             Enough!
20827,SCENE I,A debt repaid ceases to be a debt.                                  15
20828,SCENE I,You have it in your power to serve me greatly.
20829,SCENE I,
20830,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ And how, my lord? I pray you to name the thing."
20831,SCENE I,I would climb up an ice-glazed precipice
20832,SCENE I,To pluck a weed you fancied!
20833,SCENE I,
20834,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                   Why--that--Lady--
20835,SCENE I,
20836,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ 'Tis now three years, my lord, since last I saw you:     20"
20837,SCENE I,"Have you a son, my lord?"
20838,SCENE I,
20839,SCENE I,_Ordonio._               O miserable--                [_Aside._
20840,SCENE I,"Isidore! you are a man, and know mankind."
20841,SCENE I,I told you what I wished--now for the truth--
20842,SCENE I,She loved the man you kill'd.
20843,SCENE I,
20844,SCENE I,"_Isidore._                    You jest, my lord?"
20845,SCENE I,
20846,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ And till his death is proved she will not wed me.        25
20847,SCENE I,
20848,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ You sport with me, my lord?"
20849,SCENE I,
20850,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._                             Come, come! this foolery"
20851,SCENE I,"Lives only in thy looks, thy heart disowns it!"
20852,SCENE I,
20853,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ I can bear this, and any thing more grievous"
20854,SCENE I,"From you, my lord--but how can I serve you here?"
20855,SCENE I,
20856,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._ Why, you can utter with a solemn gesture                 30"
20857,SCENE I,"Oracular sentences of deep no-meaning,"
20858,SCENE I,"Wear a quaint garment, make mysterious antics--"
20859,SCENE I,
20860,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ I am dull, my lord! I do not comprehend you."
20861,SCENE I,
20862,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._ In blunt terms, you can play the sorcerer."
20863,SCENE I,"She hath no faith in Holy Church, 'tis true:                        35"
20864,SCENE I,Her lover schooled her in some newer nonsense!
20865,SCENE I,Yet still a tale of spirits works upon her.
20866,SCENE I,"She is a lone enthusiast, sensitive,"
20867,SCENE I,"Shivers, and can not keep the tears in her eye:"
20868,SCENE I,And such do love the marvellous too well                            40
20869,SCENE I,Not to believe it. We will wind up her fancy
20870,SCENE I,"With a strange music, that she knows not of--"
20871,SCENE I,"With fumes of frankincense, and mummery,"
20872,SCENE I,"Then leave, as one sure token of his death,"
20873,SCENE I,"That portrait, which from off the dead man's neck                   45"
20874,SCENE I,"I bade thee take, the trophy of thy conquest."
20875,SCENE I,
20876,SCENE I,_Isidore._ Will that be a sure sign?
20877,SCENE I,
20878,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                           Beyond suspicion.
20879,SCENE I,"Fondly caressing him, her favour'd lover,"
20880,SCENE I,(By some base spell he had bewitched her senses)
20881,SCENE I,"She whispered such dark fears of me forsooth,                       50"
20882,SCENE I,As made this heart pour gall into my veins.
20883,SCENE I,And as she coyly bound it round his neck
20884,SCENE I,She made him promise silence; and now holds
20885,SCENE I,The secret of the existence of this portrait
20886,SCENE I,Known only to her lover and herself.                                55
20887,SCENE I,"But I had traced her, stolen unnotic'd on them,"
20888,SCENE I,And unsuspected saw and heard the whole.
20889,SCENE I,
20890,SCENE I,_Isidore._ But now I should have cursed the man who told me
20891,SCENE I,"You could ask aught, my lord, and I refuse--"
20892,SCENE I,But this I can not do.
20893,SCENE I,
20894,SCENE I,_Ordonio._             Where lies your scruple?                     60
20895,SCENE I,
20896,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ Why--why, my lord!"
20897,SCENE I,"You know you told me that the lady lov'd you,"
20898,SCENE I,Had loved you with incautious tenderness;
20899,SCENE I,"That if the young man, her betroth√©d husband,"
20900,SCENE I,"Returned, yourself, and she, and the honour of both                 65"
20901,SCENE I,Must perish. Now though with no tenderer scruples
20902,SCENE I,"Than those which being native to the heart,"
20903,SCENE I,"Than those, my lord, which merely being a man--"
20904,SCENE I,
20905,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ This fellow is a Man--he killed for hire
20906,SCENE I,"One whom he knew not, yet has tender scruples!                      70"
20907,SCENE I,
20908,SCENE I,[_Then turning to ISIDORE._
20909,SCENE I,
20910,SCENE I,"These doubts, these fears, thy whine, thy stammering--"
20911,SCENE I,"Pish, fool! thou blunder'st through the book of guilt,"
20912,SCENE I,Spelling thy villainy.
20913,SCENE I,
20914,SCENE I,"_Isidore._             My lord--my lord,"
20915,SCENE I,"I can bear much--yes, very much from you!"
20916,SCENE I,But there's a point where sufferance is meanness:                   75
20917,SCENE I,I am no villain--never kill'd for hire--
20918,SCENE I,My gratitude----
20919,SCENE I,
20920,SCENE I,_Ordonio._       O aye--your gratitude!
20921,SCENE I,'Twas a well-sounding word--what have you done with it?
20922,SCENE I,
20923,SCENE I,_Isidore._ Who proffers his past favours for my virtue--
20924,SCENE I,
20925,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                                               Virtue----
20926,SCENE I,
20927,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ Tries to o'erreach me--is a very sharper,                80"
20928,SCENE I,"And should not speak of gratitude, my lord."
20929,SCENE I,I knew not 'twas your brother!
20930,SCENE I,
20931,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                     And who told you?
20932,SCENE I,
20933,SCENE I,_Isidore._ He himself told me.
20934,SCENE I,
20935,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                     Ha! you talk'd with him!
20936,SCENE I,"And those, the two Morescoes who were with you?"
20937,SCENE I,
20938,SCENE I,_Isidore._ Both fell in a night brawl at Malaga.                    85
20939,SCENE I,
20940,SCENE I,_Ordonio (in a low voice)._ My brother--
20941,SCENE I,
20942,SCENE I,"_Isidore._                               Yes, my lord, I could not"
20943,SCENE I,tell you!
20944,SCENE I,I thrust away the thought--it drove me wild.
20945,SCENE I,But listen to me now--I pray you listen----
20946,SCENE I,
20947,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Villain! no more. I'll hear no more of it.
20948,SCENE I,
20949,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ My lord, it much imports your future safety              90"
20950,SCENE I,That you should hear it.
20951,SCENE I,
20952,SCENE I,_Ordonio (turning off from Isidore)._ Am not I a man!
20953,SCENE I,'Tis as it should be! tut--the deed itself
20954,SCENE I,"Was idle, and these after-pangs still idler!"
20955,SCENE I,
20956,SCENE I,_Isidore._ We met him in the very place you mentioned.
20957,SCENE I,Hard by a grove of firs--
20958,SCENE I,
20959,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                Enough--enough--                          95
20960,SCENE I,
20961,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ He fought us valiantly, and wounded all;"
20962,SCENE I,"In fine, compelled a parley."
20963,SCENE I,
20964,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                   Alvar! brother!
20965,SCENE I,
20966,SCENE I,_Isidore._ He offered me his purse--
20967,SCENE I,
20968,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                           Yes?
20969,SCENE I,
20970,SCENE I,_Isidore._                                Yes--I spurned it.--
20971,SCENE I,He promised us I know not what--in vain!
20972,SCENE I,"Then with a look and voice that overawed me,                       100"
20973,SCENE I,"He said, What mean you, friends? My life is dear:"
20974,SCENE I,"I have a brother and a promised wife,"
20975,SCENE I,"Who make life dear to me--and if I fall,"
20976,SCENE I,That brother will roam earth and hell for vengeance.
20977,SCENE I,There was a likeness in his face to yours;                         105
20978,SCENE I,"I asked his brother's name: he said--Ordonio,"
20979,SCENE I,Son of Lord Valdez! I had well nigh fainted.
20980,SCENE I,"At length I said (if that indeed I said it,"
20981,SCENE I,"And that no Spirit made my tongue its organ,)"
20982,SCENE I,"That woman is dishonoured by that brother,                         110"
20983,SCENE I,And he the man who sent us to destroy you.
20984,SCENE I,He drove a thrust at me in rage. I told him
20985,SCENE I,He wore her portrait round his neck. He look'd
20986,SCENE I,As he had been made of the rock that propt his back--
20987,SCENE I,"Aye, just as you look now--only less ghastly!                      115"
20988,SCENE I,"At length recovering from his trance, he threw"
20989,SCENE I,"His sword away, and bade us take his life,"
20990,SCENE I,It was not worth his keeping.
20991,SCENE I,
20992,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                    And you kill'd him?
20993,SCENE I,Oh blood hounds! may eternal wrath flame round you!
20994,SCENE I,He was his Maker's Image undefac'd!                                120
20995,SCENE I,It seizes me--by Hell I will go on!
20996,SCENE I,"What--would'st thou stop, man? thy pale looks won't save thee!"
20997,SCENE I,Oh cold--cold--cold! shot through with icy cold!
20998,SCENE I,
20999,SCENE I,_Isidore (aside)._ Were he alive he had returned ere now.
21000,SCENE I,The consequence the same--dead through his plotting!               125
21001,SCENE I,
21002,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ O this unutterable dying away--here--
21003,SCENE I,This sickness of the heart!
21004,SCENE I,What if I went
21005,SCENE I,"And liv'd in a hollow tomb, and fed on weeds?"
21006,SCENE I,Aye! that's the road to heaven! O fool! fool! fool!
21007,SCENE I,"What have I done but that which nature destined,                   130"
21008,SCENE I,Or the blind elements stirred up within me?
21009,SCENE I,"If good were meant, why were we made these beings?"
21010,SCENE I,And if not meant--
21011,SCENE I,
21012,SCENE I,"_Isidore._         You are disturbed, my lord!"
21013,SCENE I,
21014,SCENE I,_Ordonio (starts)._ A gust of the soul! i'faith it overset me.
21015,SCENE I,O 'twas all folly--all! idle as laughter!                          135
21016,SCENE I,"Now, Isidore! I swear that thou shalt aid me."
21017,SCENE I,
21018,SCENE I,_Isidore (in a low voice)._ I'll perish first!
21019,SCENE I,
21020,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                                     What dost thou
21021,SCENE I,mutter of?
21022,SCENE I,
21023,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ Some of your servants know me, I am certain."
21024,SCENE I,
21025,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ There's some sense in that scruple; but we'll mask you.
21026,SCENE I,
21027,SCENE I,_Isidore._ They'll know my gait: but stay! last night I watched    140
21028,SCENE I,"A stranger near the ruin in the wood,"
21029,SCENE I,Who as it seemed was gathering herbs and wild flowers.
21030,SCENE I,"I had followed him at distance, seen him scale"
21031,SCENE I,"Its western wall, and by an easier entrance"
21032,SCENE I,"Stole after him unnoticed. There I marked,                         145"
21033,SCENE I,That mid the chequer work of light and shade
21034,SCENE I,"With curious choice he plucked no other flowers,"
21035,SCENE I,But those on which the moonlight fell: and once
21036,SCENE I,I heard him muttering o'er the plant. A wizard--
21037,SCENE I,Some gaunt slave prowling here for dark employment.                150
21038,SCENE I,
21039,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Doubtless you question'd him?
21040,SCENE I,
21041,SCENE I,"_Isidore._                               'Twas my intention,"
21042,SCENE I,Having first traced him homeward to his haunt.
21043,SCENE I,"But lo! the stern Dominican, whose spies"
21044,SCENE I,"Lurk every where, already (as it seemed)"
21045,SCENE I,Had given commission to his apt familiar                           155
21046,SCENE I,"To seek and sound the Moor; who now returning,"
21047,SCENE I,Was by this trusty agent stopped midway.
21048,SCENE I,"I, dreading fresh suspicion if found near him"
21049,SCENE I,"In that lone place, again concealed myself:"
21050,SCENE I,"Yet within hearing. So the Moor was question'd,                    160"
21051,SCENE I,"And in your name, as lord of this domain,"
21052,SCENE I,"Proudly he answered, 'Say to the Lord Ordonio,"
21053,SCENE I,He that can bring the dead to life again!'
21054,SCENE I,
21055,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ A strange reply!
21056,SCENE I,
21057,SCENE I,"_Isidore._                  Aye, all of him is strange."
21058,SCENE I,"He called himself a Christian, yet he wears                        165"
21059,SCENE I,"The Moorish robes, as if he courted death."
21060,SCENE I,
21061,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Where does this wizard live?
21062,SCENE I,
21063,SCENE I,_Isidore (pointing to the distance)._ You see that brooklet?
21064,SCENE I,Trace its course backward: through a narrow opening
21065,SCENE I,It leads you to the place.
21066,SCENE I,
21067,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                 How shall I know it?
21068,SCENE I,
21069,SCENE I,_Isidore._ You cannot err. It is a small green dell                170
21070,SCENE I,"Built all around with high off-sloping hills,"
21071,SCENE I,And from its shape our peasants aptly call it
21072,SCENE I,"The Giant's Cradle. There's a lake in the midst,"
21073,SCENE I,"And round its banks tall wood that branches over,"
21074,SCENE I,And makes a kind of faery forest grow                              175
21075,SCENE I,Down in the water. At the further end
21076,SCENE I,A puny cataract falls on the lake;
21077,SCENE I,"And there, a curious sight! you see its shadow"
21078,SCENE I,"For ever curling, like a wreath of smoke,"
21079,SCENE I,Up through the foliage of those faery trees.                       180
21080,SCENE I,His cot stands opposite. You cannot miss it.
21081,SCENE I,
21082,SCENE I,"_Ordonio (in retiring stops suddenly at the edge of the scene, and"
21083,SCENE I,then turning round to Isidore)._ Ha!--Who lurks there! Have we
21084,SCENE I,been overheard?
21085,SCENE I,There where the smooth high wall of slate-rock glitters----
21086,SCENE I,
21087,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ 'Neath those tall stones, which propping each the other,"
21088,SCENE I,Form a mock portal with their pointed arch?                        185
21089,SCENE I,"Pardon my smiles! 'Tis a poor idiot boy,"
21090,SCENE I,"Who sits in the sun, and twirls a bough about,"
21091,SCENE I,His weak eyes seeth'd in most unmeaning tears.
21092,SCENE I,"And so he sits, swaying his cone-like head,"
21093,SCENE I,"And staring at his bough from morn to sun-set,                     190"
21094,SCENE I,See-saws his voice in inarticulate noises.
21095,SCENE I,
21096,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._ 'Tis well, and now for this same wizard's lair."
21097,SCENE I,
21098,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ Some three strides up the hill, a mountain ash"
21099,SCENE I,Stretches its lower boughs and scarlet clusters
21100,SCENE I,O'er the old thatch.
21101,SCENE I,
21102,SCENE I,_Ordonio._           I shall not fail to find it.                  195

21230,SCENE II,"That my return involved Ordonio's death,"
21231,SCENE II,"I trust, would give me an unmingled pang,"

21234,SCENE II,"Which soon must be his grave, and my Teresa--                       35"

21245,SCENE II,"That grows on mountain bleak, or tangled forest,                    45"
21246,SCENE II,You have learnt to name----
21247,SCENE II,Hark! heard you not some footsteps?
21248,SCENE II,
21249,SCENE II,_Alvar._ What if it were my brother coming onwards?
21250,SCENE II,I sent a most mysterious message to him.
21251,SCENE II,
21252,SCENE II,_Enter ORDONIO_
21253,SCENE II,
21254,SCENE II,_Alvar._ It is he!
21255,SCENE II,
21256,SCENE II,_Ordonio (to himself as he enters)._ If I distinguish'd right her
21257,SCENE II,"gait and stature,                                               50"
21258,SCENE II,"It was the Moorish woman, Isidore's wife,"
21259,SCENE II,"That passed me as I entered. A lit taper,"
21260,SCENE II,"In the night air, doth not more naturally"
21261,SCENE II,"Attract the night-flies round it, than a conjuror"
21262,SCENE II,Draws round him the whole female neighbourhood.                     55
21263,SCENE II,
21264,SCENE II,[_Addressing ALVAR._
21265,SCENE II,
21266,SCENE II,"You know my name, I guess, if not my person."
21267,SCENE II,"I am Ordonio, son of the Lord Valdez."
21268,SCENE II,
21269,SCENE II,_Alvar._ The Son of Valdez!
21270,SCENE II,
21271,SCENE II,"[_ORDONIO walks leisurely round the room, and looks"
21272,SCENE II,attentively at the plants._
21273,SCENE II,
21274,SCENE II,"_Zulimez (to Alvar)._       Why, what ails you now?"
21275,SCENE II,"How your hand trembles! Alvar, speak! what wish you?"
21276,SCENE II,
21277,SCENE II,_Alvar._ To fall upon his neck and weep forgiveness!                60
21278,SCENE II,
21279,SCENE II,"_Ordonio (returning, and aloud)._ Plucked in the moonlight from a"
21280,SCENE II,ruined abbey--
21281,SCENE II,"Those only, which the pale rays visited!"
21282,SCENE II,"O the unintelligible power of weeds,"
21283,SCENE II,When a few odd prayers have been muttered o'er them:
21284,SCENE II,"Then they work miracles! I warrant you,                             65"
21285,SCENE II,"There's not a leaf, but underneath it lurks"
21286,SCENE II,Some serviceable imp.
21287,SCENE II,There's one of you
21288,SCENE II,Hath sent me a strange message.
21289,SCENE II,
21290,SCENE II,_Alvar._                        I am he.
21291,SCENE II,
21292,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ With you, then, I am to speak:"
21293,SCENE II,
21294,SCENE II,[_Haughtily waving his hand to ZULIMEZ._
21295,SCENE II,
21296,SCENE II,"And mark you, alone.                           [_Exit ZULIMEZ._     70"
21297,SCENE II,'He that can bring the dead to life again!'--
21298,SCENE II,"Such was your message, Sir! You are no dullard,"
21299,SCENE II,But one that strips the outward rind of things!
21300,SCENE II,
21301,SCENE II,"_Alvar._ 'Tis fabled there are fruits with tempting rinds,"
21302,SCENE II,That are all dust and rottenness within.                            75
21303,SCENE II,Would'st thou I should strip such?
21304,SCENE II,
21305,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._                         Thou quibbling fool,"
21306,SCENE II,What dost thou mean? Think'st thou I journeyed hither
21307,SCENE II,To sport with thee?
21308,SCENE II,
21309,SCENE II,"_Alvar._            O no, my lord! to sport"
21310,SCENE II,Best suits the gaiety of innocence.
21311,SCENE II,
21312,SCENE II,_Ordonio (aside)._ O what a thing is man! the wisest heart          80
21313,SCENE II,"A fool! a fool that laughs at its own folly,"
21314,SCENE II,Yet still a fool!                   [_Looks round the cottage._
21315,SCENE II,You are poor!
21316,SCENE II,
21317,SCENE II,_Alvar._ What follows thence?
21318,SCENE II,
21319,SCENE II,_Ordonio._                    That you would fain be richer.
21320,SCENE II,"The inquisition, too--You comprehend me?"
21321,SCENE II,"You are poor, in peril. I have wealth and power,                    85"
21322,SCENE II,"Can quench the flames, and cure your poverty:"
21323,SCENE II,"And for the boon I ask of you but this,"
21324,SCENE II,That you should serve me--once--for a few hours.
21325,SCENE II,
21326,SCENE II,_Alvar._ Thou art the son of Valdez! would to Heaven
21327,SCENE II,That I could truly and for ever serve thee.                         90
21328,SCENE II,
21329,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ The slave begins to soften.                [_Aside._
21330,SCENE II,"You are my friend,"
21331,SCENE II,"'He that can bring the dead to life again,'"
21332,SCENE II,"Nay, no defence to me! The holy brethren"
21333,SCENE II,Believe these calumnies--I know thee better.
21334,SCENE II,"Thou art a man, and as a man I'll trust thee!                       95"
21335,SCENE II,
21336,SCENE II,_Alvar (aside)._ Alas! this hollow mirth--Declare your business.
21337,SCENE II,
21338,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ I love a lady, and she would love me"
21339,SCENE II,But for an idle and fantastic scruple.
21340,SCENE II,"Have you no servants here, no listeners?"
21341,SCENE II,
21342,SCENE II,[_ORDONIO steps to the door._
21343,SCENE II,
21344,SCENE II,"_Alvar._ What, faithless too? False to his angel wife?             100"
21345,SCENE II,"To such a wife? Well might'st thou look so wan,"
21346,SCENE II,Ill-starr'd Teresa!----Wretch! my softer soul
21347,SCENE II,"Is pass'd away, and I will probe his conscience!"
21348,SCENE II,
21349,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ In truth this lady lov'd another man,"
21350,SCENE II,But he has perish'd.
21351,SCENE II,
21352,SCENE II,_Alvar._             What! you kill'd him? hey?                    105
21353,SCENE II,
21354,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ I'll dash thee to the earth, if thou but think'st it!"
21355,SCENE II,Insolent slave! how dar'dst thou--
21356,SCENE II,
21357,SCENE II,"[_Turns abruptly from ALVAR, and then to himself._"
21358,SCENE II,
21359,SCENE II,Why! what's this?
21360,SCENE II,"'Twas idiotcy! I'll tie myself to an aspen,"
21361,SCENE II,And wear a fool's cap--
21362,SCENE II,
21363,SCENE II,_Alvar._                Fare thee well--[845:1]
21364,SCENE II,"I pity thee, Ordonio, even to anguish.    [_ALVAR is retiring._"
21365,SCENE II,
21366,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ Ho!                             [_Calling to ALVAR._    110
21367,SCENE II,
21368,SCENE II,"_Alvar._       Be brief, what wish you?"
21369,SCENE II,
21370,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ You are deep at bartering--You charge yourself
21371,SCENE II,"At a round sum. Come, come, I spake unwisely."
21372,SCENE II,
21373,SCENE II,_Alvar._ I listen to you.
21374,SCENE II,
21375,SCENE II,_Ordonio._                In a sudden tempest
21376,SCENE II,"Did Alvar perish--he, I mean--the lover--                          115"
21377,SCENE II,The fellow----
21378,SCENE II,
21379,SCENE II,"_Alvar._       Nay, speak out! 'twill ease your heart"
21380,SCENE II,To call him villain!--Why stand'st thou aghast?
21381,SCENE II,Men think it natural to hate their rivals.
21382,SCENE II,
21383,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ Now, till she knows him dead, she will not wed me."
21384,SCENE II,
21385,SCENE II,"_Alvar._ Are you not wedded, then? Merciful Heaven!                120"
21386,SCENE II,Not wedded to Teresa?
21387,SCENE II,
21388,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._            Why, what ails thee?"
21389,SCENE II,"What, art thou mad? why look'st thou upward so?"
21390,SCENE II,"Dost pray to Lucifer, Prince of the Air?"
21391,SCENE II,
21392,SCENE II,_Alvar._ Proceed. I shall be silent.
21393,SCENE II,
21394,SCENE II,_Ordonio._                           To Teresa?
21395,SCENE II,"Politic wizard! ere you sent that message,                         125"
21396,SCENE II,"You had conn'd your lesson, made yourself proficient"
21397,SCENE II,In all my fortunes. Hah! you prophesied
21398,SCENE II,"A golden crop! Well, you have not mistaken--"
21399,SCENE II,Be faithful to me and I'll pay thee nobly.
21400,SCENE II,
21401,SCENE II,_Alvar._ Well! and this lady!                                      130
21402,SCENE II,
21403,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ If we could make her certain of his death,"
21404,SCENE II,"She needs must wed me. Ere her lover left her,"
21405,SCENE II,"She tied a little portrait round his neck,"
21406,SCENE II,Entreating him to wear it.
21407,SCENE II,
21408,SCENE II,_Alvar._                   Yes! he did so!
21409,SCENE II,
21410,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ Why no: he was afraid of accidents,                     135"
21411,SCENE II,"Of robberies, and shipwrecks, and the like."
21412,SCENE II,"In secrecy he gave it me to keep,"
21413,SCENE II,Till his return.
21414,SCENE II,
21415,SCENE II,_Alvar._ What! he was your friend then?
21416,SCENE II,
21417,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ I was his friend.--
21418,SCENE II,"Now that he gave it me,             140"
21419,SCENE II,This lady knows not. You are a mighty wizard--
21420,SCENE II,Can call the dead man up--he will not come.--
21421,SCENE II,He is in heaven then--there you have no influence.
21422,SCENE II,Still there are tokens--and your imps may bring you
21423,SCENE II,Something he wore about him when he died.                          145
21424,SCENE II,And when the smoke of the incense on the altar
21425,SCENE II,"Is pass'd, your spirits will have left this picture."
21426,SCENE II,What say you now?
21427,SCENE II,
21428,SCENE II,"_Alvar._          Ordonio, I will do it."
21429,SCENE II,
21430,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ We'll hazard no delay. Be it to-night,"
21431,SCENE II,In the early evening. Ask for the Lord Valdez.                     150
21432,SCENE II,"I will prepare him. Music too, and incense,"
21433,SCENE II,"(For I have arranged it--music, altar, incense)"
21434,SCENE II,"All shall be ready. Here is this same picture,"
21435,SCENE II,"And here, what you will value more, a purse."
21436,SCENE II,Come early for your magic ceremonies.                              155
21437,SCENE II,
21438,SCENE II,_Alvar._ I will not fail to meet you.
21439,SCENE II,
21440,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ Till next we meet, farewell!        [_Exit ORDONIO._"
21441,SCENE II,
21442,SCENE II,"_Alvar (alone, indignantly flings the purse away and gazes"
21443,SCENE II,passionately at the portrait)._     And I did curse thee!
21444,SCENE II,At midnight! on my knees! and I believed
21445,SCENE II,"Thee perjur'd, thee a traitress! thee dishonour'd!"
21446,SCENE II,O blind and credulous fool! O guilt of folly!                      160
21447,SCENE II,"Should not thy inarticulate fondnesses,"
21448,SCENE II,Thy infant loves--should not thy maiden vows
21449,SCENE II,Have come upon my heart? And this sweet Image
21450,SCENE II,"Tied round my neck with many a chaste endearment,"
21451,SCENE II,"And thrilling hands, that made me weep and tremble--               165"
21452,SCENE II,"Ah, coward dupe! to yield it to the miscreant,"
21453,SCENE II,Who spake pollution of thee! barter for life
21454,SCENE II,"This farewell pledge, which with impassioned vow"
21455,SCENE II,I had sworn that I would grasp--ev'n in my Death-pang!
21456,SCENE II,
21457,SCENE II,"I am unworthy of thy love, Teresa,                                 170"
21458,SCENE II,"Of that unearthly smile upon those lips,"
21459,SCENE II,Which ever smiled on me! Yet do not scorn me--

21609,SCENE I,"_Valdez._                                   Nay,"
21610,SCENE I,My Alvar lov'd sad music from a child.
21611,SCENE I,Once he was lost; and after weary search
21612,SCENE I,We found him in an open place in the wood.
21613,SCENE I,"To which spot he had followed a blind boy,                           5"
21614,SCENE I,Who breath'd into a pipe of sycamore
21615,SCENE I,"Some strangely moving notes: and these, he said,"
21616,SCENE I,Were taught him in a dream. Him we first saw
21617,SCENE I,Stretch'd on the broad top of a sunny heath-bank:
21618,SCENE I,"And lower down poor Alvar, fast asleep,                             10"
21619,SCENE I,His head upon the blind boy's dog. It pleas'd me
21620,SCENE I,To mark how he had fasten'd round the pipe
21621,SCENE I,A silver toy his grandam had late given him.
21622,SCENE I,Methinks I see him now as he then look'd--
21623,SCENE I,"Even so!--He had outgrown his infant dress,                         15"
21624,SCENE I,Yet still he wore it.
21625,SCENE I,
21626,SCENE I,_Alvar (aside)._      My tears must not flow!
21627,SCENE I,"I must not clasp his knees, and cry, My father!"

21630,SCENE I,
21631,SCENE I,"_Teresa._ Lord Valdez, you have asked my presence here,"
21632,SCENE I,And I submit; but (Heaven bear witness for me)
21633,SCENE I,My heart approves it not! 'tis mockery.                             20
21634,SCENE I,
21635,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Believe you then no preternatural influence:
21636,SCENE I,Believe you not that spirits throng around us?
21637,SCENE I,
21638,SCENE I,_Teresa._ Say rather that I have imagined it
21639,SCENE I,A possible thing: and it has sooth'd my soul
21640,SCENE I,As other fancies have; but ne'er seduced me                         25
21641,SCENE I,To traffic with the black and frenzied hope
21642,SCENE I,That the dead hear the voice of witch or wizard.   [_To ALVAR._
21643,SCENE I,"Stranger, I mourn and blush to see you here,"
21644,SCENE I,On such employment! With far other thoughts
21645,SCENE I,I left you.                                                         30
21646,SCENE I,
21647,SCENE I,_Ordonio (aside)._ Ha! he has been tampering with her?
21648,SCENE I,
21649,SCENE I,_Alvar._ O high-soul'd Maiden! and more dear to me
21650,SCENE I,Than suits the stranger's name!--
21651,SCENE I,I swear to thee
21652,SCENE I,I will uncover all conceal√©d guilt.
21653,SCENE I,"Doubt, but decide not! Stand ye from the altar.                     35"
21654,SCENE I,
21655,SCENE I,[_Here a strain of music is heard from behind the scene._
21656,SCENE I,

21658,SCENE I,I call up the departed!
21659,SCENE I,Soul of Alvar!
21660,SCENE I,"Hear our soft suit, and heed my milder spell:"
21661,SCENE I,"So may the gates of Paradise, unbarr'd,"
21662,SCENE I,Cease thy swift toils! Since haply thou art one                     40
21663,SCENE I,Of that innumerable company
21664,SCENE I,"Who in broad circle, lovelier than the rainbow,"
21665,SCENE I,"Girdle this round earth in a dizzy motion,"
21666,SCENE I,With noise too vast and constant to be heard:
21667,SCENE I,"Fitliest unheard! For oh, ye numberless,                            45"
21668,SCENE I,"And rapid travellers! what ear unstunn'd,"
21669,SCENE I,"What sense unmadden'd, might bear up against"

21673,SCENE I,"That roar and whiten, like a burst of waters,"
21674,SCENE I,"A sweet appearance, but a dread illusion"
21675,SCENE I,To the parch'd caravan that roams by night!
21676,SCENE I,And ye upbuild on the becalmed waves
21677,SCENE I,"That whirling pillar, which from earth to heaven                    55"
21678,SCENE I,"Stands vast, and moves in blackness! Ye too split"
21679,SCENE I,The ice mount! and with fragments many and huge
21680,SCENE I,"Tempest the new-thaw'd sea, whose sudden gulfs"
21681,SCENE I,"Suck in, perchance, some Lapland wizard's skiff!"
21682,SCENE I,"Then round and round the whirlpool's marge ye dance,                60"

21862,SCENE II,"Such calm unwonted bliss possess'd my spirit,"
21863,SCENE II,"A trance so cloudless, that those sounds, hard by,"
21864,SCENE II,Of trampling uproar fell upon mine ear                               5
21865,SCENE II,As alien and unnoticed as the rain-storm
21866,SCENE II,"Beats on the roof of some fair banquet-room,"
21867,SCENE II,While sweetest melodies are warbling----
21868,SCENE II,
21869,SCENE II,_Enter VALDEZ._
21870,SCENE II,
21871,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ Ye pitying saints, forgive a father's blindness,"
21872,SCENE II,And extricate us from this net of peril!                            10
21873,SCENE II,
21874,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ Who wakes anew my fears, and speaks of peril?"
21875,SCENE II,
21876,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ O best Teresa, wisely wert thou prompted!"
21877,SCENE II,This was no feat of mortal agency!
21878,SCENE II,"That picture--Oh, that picture tells me all!"
21879,SCENE II,"With a flash of light it came, in flames it vanished,               15"
21880,SCENE II,"Self-kindled, self-consum'd: bright as thy life,"
21881,SCENE II,"Sudden and unexpected as thy fate,"
21882,SCENE II,Alvar! My son! My son!--The Inquisitor--
21883,SCENE II,
21884,SCENE II,_Teresa._ Torture me not! But Alvar--Oh of Alvar?
21885,SCENE II,
21886,SCENE II,_Valdez._ How often would he plead for these Morescoes!             20
21887,SCENE II,"The brood accurst! remorseless, coward murderers!"
21888,SCENE II,
21889,SCENE II,_Teresa._ So? so?--I comprehend you--He is----

21902,SCENE II,"Which whispers to my soul, though haply varied"

21905,SCENE II,
21906,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ Yes, for three wasting years, thus and no other,"
21907,SCENE II,He has lived for thee--a spirit for thy spirit!

21909,SCENE II,To every voice which makes the heart a listener                     35

21918,SCENE II,Was Alvar lost to thee--
21919,SCENE II,Accurst assassins!
21920,SCENE II,"Disarmed, o'erpowered, despairing of defence,"
21921,SCENE II,At his bared breast he seem'd to grasp some relique
21922,SCENE II,More dear than was his life----
21923,SCENE II,
21924,SCENE II,_Teresa._                       O Heavens! my portrait!
21925,SCENE II,And he did grasp it in his death pang!
21926,SCENE II,"Off, false demon,            45"

21936,SCENE II,[_VALDEZ moves towards the back of the stage to meet
21937,SCENE II,"ORDONIO, and during the concluding lines of"

21940,SCENE II,
21941,SCENE II,Is Alvar dead? what then?
21942,SCENE II,The nuptial rites and funeral shall be one!                         50
21943,SCENE II,"Here's no abiding-place for thee, Teresa.--"
21944,SCENE II,"Away! they see me not--Thou seest me, Alvar!"
21945,SCENE II,"To thee I bend my course.--But first one question,"
21946,SCENE II,One question to Ordonio.--My limbs tremble--
21947,SCENE II,There I may sit unmark'd--a moment will restore me.                 55
21948,SCENE II,
21949,SCENE II,[_Retires out of sight._
21950,SCENE II,
21951,SCENE II,_Ordonio (as he advances with Valdez)._ These are the dungeon keys.
21952,SCENE II,"Monviedro knew not,"
21953,SCENE II,"That I too had received the wizard's message,"
21954,SCENE II,'He that can bring the dead to life again.'
21955,SCENE II,"But now he is satisfied, I plann'd this scheme"
21956,SCENE II,"To work a full conviction on the culprit,                           60"
21957,SCENE II,And he entrusts him wholly to my keeping.
21958,SCENE II,
21959,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ 'Tis well, my son! But have you yet discovered"
21960,SCENE II,(Where is Teresa?) what those speeches meant--
21961,SCENE II,"Pride, and hypocrisy, and guilt, and cunning?"
21962,SCENE II,"Then when the wizard fix'd his eye on you,                          65"
21963,SCENE II,"And you, I know not why, look'd pale and trembled--"
21964,SCENE II,"Why--why, what ails you now?--"
21965,SCENE II,
21966,SCENE II,_Ordonio._                     Me? what ails me?
21967,SCENE II,A pricking of the blood--It might have happen'd
21968,SCENE II,At any other time.--Why scan you me?
21969,SCENE II,
21970,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ His speech about the corse, and stabs and murderers,      70"
21971,SCENE II,Bore reference to the assassins----
21972,SCENE II,
21973,SCENE II,_Ordonio._                          Dup'd! dup'd! dup'd!
21974,SCENE II,"The traitor, Isidore!                  [_A pause, then wildly._"
21975,SCENE II,"I tell thee, my dear father!"
21976,SCENE II,I am most glad of this.
21977,SCENE II,
21978,SCENE II,_Valdez._               True--sorcery
21979,SCENE II,Merits its doom; and this perchance may guide us
21980,SCENE II,To the discovery of the murderers.                                  75
21981,SCENE II,I have their statures and their several faces
21982,SCENE II,"So present to me, that but once to meet them"
21983,SCENE II,Would be to recognize.
21984,SCENE II,
21985,SCENE II,_Ordonio._             Yes! yes! we recognize them.
21986,SCENE II,"I was benumb'd, and staggered up and down"
21987,SCENE II,Through darkness without light--dark--dark--dark!                   80
21988,SCENE II,"My flesh crept chill, my limbs felt manacled"
21989,SCENE II,"As had a snake coil'd round them!--Now 'tis sunshine,"
21990,SCENE II,And the blood dances freely through its channels!
21991,SCENE II,
21992,SCENE II,[_Then to himself._
21993,SCENE II,
21994,SCENE II,"This is my virtuous, grateful Isidore!"
21995,SCENE II,
21996,SCENE II,[_Then mimicking ISIDORE'S manner and voice._
21997,SCENE II,
21998,SCENE II,"'A common trick of gratitude, my lord!'                             85"
21999,SCENE II,Old Gratitude! a dagger would dissect
22000,SCENE II,His 'own full heart'--'twere good to see its colour.
22001,SCENE II,
22002,SCENE II,_Valdez._ These magic sights! O that I ne'er had yielded
22003,SCENE II,"To your entreaties! Neither had I yielded,"
22004,SCENE II,But that in spite of your own seeming faith                         90
22005,SCENE II,"I held it for some innocent stratagem,"
22006,SCENE II,"Which love had prompted, to remove the doubts"
22007,SCENE II,Of wild Teresa--by fancies quelling fancies!
22008,SCENE II,
22009,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ Love! love! and then we hate! and what? and wherefore?
22010,SCENE II,Hatred and love! fancies opposed by fancies!                        95
22011,SCENE II,What? if one reptile sting another reptile?
22012,SCENE II,Where is the crime? The goodly face of nature
22013,SCENE II,Hath one disfeaturing stain the less upon it.
22014,SCENE II,"Are we not all predestined transiency,"
22015,SCENE II,"And cold dishonour? Grant it, that this hand                       100"
22016,SCENE II,Had given a morsel to the hungry worms
22017,SCENE II,Somewhat too early--Where's the crime of this?
22018,SCENE II,That this must needs bring on the idiotcy
22019,SCENE II,Of moist-eyed penitence--'tis like a dream!
22020,SCENE II,
22021,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ Wild talk, my son! But thy excess of feeling----         105"
22022,SCENE II,Almost I fear it hath unhinged his brain.
22023,SCENE II,
22024,SCENE II,"_Ordonio (Teresa reappears and advances slowly)._ Say, I had laid"
22025,SCENE II,a body in the sun!
22026,SCENE II,Well! in a month there swarm forth from the corse
22027,SCENE II,"A thousand, nay, ten thousand sentient beings"
22028,SCENE II,"In place of that one man.--Say, I had kill'd him!                  110"
22029,SCENE II,
22030,SCENE II,[_TERESA stops listening._
22031,SCENE II,
22032,SCENE II,"Yet who shall tell me, that each one and all"
22033,SCENE II,"Of these ten thousand lives is not as happy,"
22034,SCENE II,"As that one life, which being push'd aside,"
22035,SCENE II,Made room for these unnumbered----
22036,SCENE II,
22037,SCENE II,_Valdez._                          O mere madness!
22038,SCENE II,
22039,SCENE II,"[_TERESA moves hastily forwards, and places herself"
22040,SCENE II,directly before ORDONIO._
22041,SCENE II,
22042,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ Teresa? or the phantom of Teresa?                       115
22043,SCENE II,
22044,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ Alas! the phantom only, if in truth"
22045,SCENE II,"The substance of her being, her life's life,"
22046,SCENE II,Have ta'en its flight through Alvar's death-wound--
22047,SCENE II,
22048,SCENE II,[_A pause._
22049,SCENE II,
22050,SCENE II,Where--
22051,SCENE II,(Even coward murder grants the dead a grave)
22052,SCENE II,"O tell me, Valdez!--answer me, Ordonio!                            120"
22053,SCENE II,Where lies the corse of my betroth√©d husband?
22054,SCENE II,
22055,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ There, where Ordonio likewise would fain lie!"
22056,SCENE II,"In the sleep-compelling earth, in unpierc'd darkness![856:1]"
22057,SCENE II,For while we live--
22058,SCENE II,"An inward day that never, never sets,                              125"
22059,SCENE II,"Glares round the soul, and mocks the closing eyelids!"
22060,SCENE II,
22061,SCENE II,Over his rocky grave the fir-grove sighs
22062,SCENE II,A lulling ceaseless dirge! 'Tis well with him.
22063,SCENE II,
22064,SCENE II,"[_Strides off towards the altar, but returns as VALDEZ"
22065,SCENE II,is speaking._
22066,SCENE II,
22067,SCENE II,_Teresa._ The rock! the fir-grove!                [_To VALDEZ._
22068,SCENE II,Did'st thou hear him say it?
22069,SCENE II,Hush! I will ask him!
22070,SCENE II,
22071,SCENE II,_Valdez._             Urge him not--not now!                       130
22072,SCENE II,"This we beheld. Nor he nor I know more,"
22073,SCENE II,Than what the magic imagery revealed.
22074,SCENE II,"The assassin, who pressed foremost of the three----"
22075,SCENE II,
22076,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ A tender-hearted, scrupulous, grateful villain,"
22077,SCENE II,Whom I will strangle!
22078,SCENE II,
22079,SCENE II,_Valdez._             While his two companions----                 135
22080,SCENE II,
22081,SCENE II,_Ordonio._ Dead! dead already! what care we for the dead?
22082,SCENE II,
22083,SCENE II,_Valdez (to Teresa)._ Pity him! soothe him! disenchant his spirit!
22084,SCENE II,"These supernatural shews, this strange disclosure,"
22085,SCENE II,"And this too fond affection, which still broods"
22086,SCENE II,"O'er Alvar's fate, and still burns to avenge it--                  140"
22087,SCENE II,"These, struggling with his hopeless love for you,"
22088,SCENE II,"Distemper him, and give reality"
22089,SCENE II,To the creatures of his fancy.
22090,SCENE II,
22091,SCENE II,_Ordonio._                     Is it so?
22092,SCENE II,"Yes! yes! even like a child, that too abruptly"
22093,SCENE II,Roused by a glare of light from deepest sleep                      145
22094,SCENE II,Starts up bewildered and talks idly.
22095,SCENE II,Father!
22096,SCENE II,"What if the Moors that made my brother's grave,"
22097,SCENE II,"Even now were digging ours? What if the bolt,"
22098,SCENE II,"Though aim'd, I doubt not, at the son of Valdez,"
22099,SCENE II,Yet miss'd its true aim when it fell on Alvar?                     150
22100,SCENE II,
22101,SCENE II,"_Valdez._ Alvar ne'er fought against the Moors,--say rather,"
22102,SCENE II,He was their advocate; but you had march'd
22103,SCENE II,With fire and desolation through their villages.--
22104,SCENE II,Yet he by chance was captured.
22105,SCENE II,
22106,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._                     Unknown, perhaps,"
22107,SCENE II,"Captured, yet as the son of Valdez, murdered.                      155"
22108,SCENE II,"Leave all to me. Nay, whither, gentle lady?"
22109,SCENE II,
22110,SCENE II,_Valdez._ What seek you now?
22111,SCENE II,
22112,SCENE II,"_Teresa._                    A better, surer light"
22113,SCENE II,To guide me----
22114,SCENE II,
22115,SCENE II,_Both Valdez and Ordonio._ Whither?
22116,SCENE II,
22117,SCENE II,_Teresa._                           To the only place
22118,SCENE II,"Where life yet dwells for me, and ease of heart."
22119,SCENE II,These walls seem threatening to fall in upon me!                   160
22120,SCENE II,"Detain me not! a dim power drives me hence,"
22121,SCENE II,And that will be my guide.
22122,SCENE II,
22123,SCENE II,_Valdez._                  To find a lover!
22124,SCENE II,Suits that a high-born maiden's modesty?
22125,SCENE II,"O folly and shame! Tempt not my rage, Teresa!"
22126,SCENE II,
22127,SCENE II,"_Teresa._ Hopeless, I fear no human being's rage.                  165"
22128,SCENE II,And am I hastening to the arms----O Heaven!
22129,SCENE II,I haste but to the grave of my belov'd!
22130,SCENE II,
22131,SCENE II,"[_Exit, VALDEZ following after her._"
22132,SCENE II,
22133,SCENE II,"_Ordonio._ This, then, is my reward! and I must love her?"
22134,SCENE II,Scorn'd! shudder'd at! yet love her still? yes! yes!
22135,SCENE II,By the deep feelings of revenge and hate                           170
22136,SCENE II,I will still love her--woo her--win her too!        [_A pause._

22272,SCENE I,at the further end of it; supposed to be cast on it from a crevice in a
22273,SCENE I,"part of the cavern out of sight. ISIDORE alone, an extinguished torch in"
22274,SCENE I,his hand._
22275,SCENE I,
22276,SCENE I,_Isidore._ Faith 'twas a moving letter--very moving!
22277,SCENE I,"'His life in danger, no place safe but this!"
22278,SCENE I,'Twas his turn now to talk of gratitude.'
22279,SCENE I,And yet--but no! there can't be such a villain.
22280,SCENE I,It can not be!
22281,SCENE I,"Thanks to that little crevice,                        5"
22282,SCENE I,Which lets the moonlight in! I'll go and sit by it.
22283,SCENE I,"To peep at a tree, or see a he-goat's beard,"
22284,SCENE I,Or hear a cow or two breathe loud in their sleep--
22285,SCENE I,Any thing but this crash of water drops!
22286,SCENE I,These dull abortive sounds that fret the silence                    10
22287,SCENE I,With puny thwartings and mock opposition!
22288,SCENE I,So beats the death-watch to a sick man's ear.
22289,SCENE I,
22290,SCENE I,"[_He goes out of sight, opposite to the patch of"
22291,SCENE I,moonlight: and returns._
22292,SCENE I,
22293,SCENE I,A hellish pit! The very same I dreamt of!
22294,SCENE I,I was just in--and those damn'd fingers of ice
22295,SCENE I,Which clutch'd my hair up! Ha!--what's that--it mov'd.              15
22296,SCENE I,
22297,SCENE I,[_ISIDORE stands staring at another recess in the
22298,SCENE I,cavern. In the mean time ORDONIO enters with
22299,SCENE I,"a torch, and halloes to ISIDORE._"
22300,SCENE I,
22301,SCENE I,_Isidore._ I swear that I saw something moving there!
22302,SCENE I,The moonshine came and went like a flash of lightning----
22303,SCENE I,"I swear, I saw it move."
22304,SCENE I,
22305,SCENE I,"_Ordonio (goes into the recess, then returns)._"
22306,SCENE I,A jutting clay stone
22307,SCENE I,"Drops on the long lank weed, that grows beneath:"
22308,SCENE I,And the weed nods and drips.[859:1]
22309,SCENE I,
22310,SCENE I,_Isidore._                   A jest to laugh at!                    20
22311,SCENE I,"It was not that which scar'd me, good my lord."
22312,SCENE I,
22313,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._ What scar'd you, then?"
22314,SCENE I,
22315,SCENE I,_Isidore._                        You see that little rift?
22316,SCENE I,But first permit me!
22317,SCENE I,
22318,SCENE I,"[_Lights his torch at ORDONIO'S, and while lighting it._"
22319,SCENE I,
22320,SCENE I,(A lighted torch in the hand
22321,SCENE I,Is no unpleasant object here--one's breath
22322,SCENE I,"Floats round the flame, and makes as many colours                   25"
22323,SCENE I,As the thin clouds that travel near the moon.)
22324,SCENE I,You see that crevice there?
22325,SCENE I,"My torch extinguished by these water-drops,"
22326,SCENE I,"And marking that the moonlight came from thence,"
22327,SCENE I,"I stept in to it, meaning to sit there;                             30"
22328,SCENE I,But scarcely had I measured twenty paces--
22329,SCENE I,"My body bending forward, yea, o'erbalanced"
22330,SCENE I,"Almost beyond recoil, on the dim brink"
22331,SCENE I,Of a huge chasm I stept. The shadowy moonshine
22332,SCENE I,"Filling the void so counterfeited substance,                        35"
22333,SCENE I,That my foot hung aslant adown the edge.
22334,SCENE I,Was it my own fear?
22335,SCENE I,Fear too hath its instincts![860:1]
22336,SCENE I,"(And yet such dens as these are wildly told of,"
22337,SCENE I,"And there are beings that live, yet not for the eye)"
22338,SCENE I,An arm of frost above and from behind me                            40
22339,SCENE I,Pluck'd up and snatched me backward. Merciful Heaven!
22340,SCENE I,"You smile! alas, even smiles look ghastly here!"
22341,SCENE I,"My lord, I pray you, go yourself and view it."
22342,SCENE I,
22343,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ It must have shot some pleasant feelings through you.
22344,SCENE I,
22345,SCENE I,_Isidore._ If every atom of a dead man's flesh                      45
22346,SCENE I,"Should creep, each one with a particular life,"
22347,SCENE I,Yet all as cold as ever--'twas just so!
22348,SCENE I,Or had it drizzled needle-points of frost
22349,SCENE I,Upon a feverish head made suddenly bald--
22350,SCENE I,
22351,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._                                Why, Isidore,"
22352,SCENE I,"I blush for thy cowardice. It might have startled,                  50"
22353,SCENE I,"I grant you, even a brave man for a moment--"
22354,SCENE I,But such a panic--
22355,SCENE I,
22356,SCENE I,"_Isidore._         When a boy, my lord!"
22357,SCENE I,"I could have sate whole hours beside that chasm,"
22358,SCENE I,Push'd in huge stones and heard them strike and rattle
22359,SCENE I,Against its horrid sides: then hung my head                         55
22360,SCENE I,"Low down, and listened till the heavy fragments"
22361,SCENE I,"Sank with faint crash in that still groaning well,"
22362,SCENE I,"Which never thirsty pilgrim blest, which never"
22363,SCENE I,"A living thing came near--unless, perchance,"
22364,SCENE I,Some blind-worm battens on the ropy mould                           60
22365,SCENE I,Close at its edge.
22366,SCENE I,
22367,SCENE I,_Ordonio._         Art thou more coward now?
22368,SCENE I,
22369,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ Call him, that fears his fellow-man, a coward!"
22370,SCENE I,"I fear not man--but this inhuman cavern,"
22371,SCENE I,It were too bad a prison-house for goblins.
22372,SCENE I,"Beside, (you'll smile, my lord) but true it is,                     65"
22373,SCENE I,My last night's sleep was very sorely haunted
22374,SCENE I,By what had passed between us in the morning.
22375,SCENE I,O sleep of horrors! Now run down and stared at
22376,SCENE I,By forms so hideous that they mock remembrance--
22377,SCENE I,"Now seeing nothing and imagining nothing,                           70"
22378,SCENE I,But only being afraid--stifled with fear!
22379,SCENE I,While every goodly or familiar form
22380,SCENE I,Had a strange power of breathing terror round me![861:1]
22381,SCENE I,I saw you in a thousand fearful shapes;
22382,SCENE I,"And, I entreat your lordship to believe me,                         75"
22383,SCENE I,In my last dream----
22384,SCENE I,
22385,SCENE I,_Ordonio._           Well?
22386,SCENE I,
22387,SCENE I,_Isidore._                 I was in the act
22388,SCENE I,"Of falling down that chasm, when Alhadra"
22389,SCENE I,Wak'd me: she heard my heart beat.
22390,SCENE I,
22391,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                         Strange enough!
22392,SCENE I,Had you been here before?
22393,SCENE I,
22394,SCENE I,"_Isidore._                Never, my lord!"
22395,SCENE I,"But mine eyes do not see it now more clearly,                       80"
22396,SCENE I,Than in my dream I saw--that very chasm.
22397,SCENE I,
22398,SCENE I,_Ordonio (after a pause)._ I know not why it should be! yet it is--
22399,SCENE I,
22400,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ What is, my lord?"
22401,SCENE I,
22402,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                   Abhorrent from our nature
22403,SCENE I,To kill a man.--
22404,SCENE I,
22405,SCENE I,_Isidore._       Except in self-defence.
22406,SCENE I,
22407,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Why that's my case; and yet the soul recoils from it--   85
22408,SCENE I,"'Tis so with me at least. But you, perhaps,"
22409,SCENE I,Have sterner feelings?
22410,SCENE I,
22411,SCENE I,_Isidore._             Something troubles you.
22412,SCENE I,"How shall I serve you? By the life you gave me,"
22413,SCENE I,"By all that makes that life of value to me,"
22414,SCENE I,"My wife, my babes, my honour, I swear to you,                       90"
22415,SCENE I,"Name it, and I will toil to do the thing,"
22416,SCENE I,"If it be innocent! But this, my lord!"
22417,SCENE I,"Is not a place where you could perpetrate,"
22418,SCENE I,"No, nor propose a wicked thing. The darkness,"
22419,SCENE I,"When ten strides off we know 'tis cheerful moonlight,               95"
22420,SCENE I,"Collects the guilt, and crowds it round the heart."
22421,SCENE I,It must be innocent.
22422,SCENE I,
22423,SCENE I,_Ordonio._           Thyself be judge.
22424,SCENE I,One of our family knew this place well.
22425,SCENE I,
22426,SCENE I,_Isidore._ Who? when? my lord?
22427,SCENE I,
22428,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._                     What boots it, who or when?"
22429,SCENE I,Hang up thy torch--I'll tell his tale to thee.                     100
22430,SCENE I,
22431,SCENE I,[_They hang up their torches on some ridge in the cavern._
22432,SCENE I,
22433,SCENE I,"He was a man different from other men,"
22434,SCENE I,"And he despised them, yet revered himself."
22435,SCENE I,
22436,SCENE I,_Isidore (aside)._ He? He despised? Thou'rt speaking of thyself!
22437,SCENE I,"I am on my guard, however: no surprise.     [_Then to ORDONIO._"
22438,SCENE I,"What, he was mad?"
22439,SCENE I,
22440,SCENE I,_Ordonio._        All men seemed mad to him!                       105
22441,SCENE I,"Nature had made him for some other planet,"
22442,SCENE I,And pressed his soul into a human shape
22443,SCENE I,By accident or malice. In this world
22444,SCENE I,He found no fit companion.
22445,SCENE I,
22446,SCENE I,_Isidore._ Of himself he speaks.                      [_Aside._
22447,SCENE I,Alas! poor wretch!                110
22448,SCENE I,Mad men are mostly proud.
22449,SCENE I,
22450,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._                He walked alone,"
22451,SCENE I,And phantom thoughts unsought-for troubled him.
22452,SCENE I,Something within would still be shadowing out
22453,SCENE I,All possibilities; and with these shadows
22454,SCENE I,"His mind held dalliance. Once, as so it happened,                  115"
22455,SCENE I,A fancy crossed him wilder than the rest:
22456,SCENE I,To this in moody murmur and low voice
22457,SCENE I,"He yielded utterance, as some talk in sleep:"
22458,SCENE I,The man who heard him.--
22459,SCENE I,Why did'st thou look round?
22460,SCENE I,
22461,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ I have a prattler three years old, my lord!             120"
22462,SCENE I,In truth he is my darling. As I went
22463,SCENE I,"From forth my door, he made a moan in sleep--"
22464,SCENE I,But I am talking idly--pray proceed!
22465,SCENE I,And what did this man?
22466,SCENE I,

22489,SCENE I,

22491,SCENE I,
22492,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._                           He proved a traitor,          140"

22494,SCENE I,And they between them hatch'd a damn√©d plot
22495,SCENE I,To hunt him down to infamy and death.

22507,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ That which his wisdom prompted--
22508,SCENE I,"He made the traitor meet him in this cavern,"
22509,SCENE I,And here he kill'd the traitor.
22510,SCENE I,
22511,SCENE I,_Isidore._                      No! the fool!                      150
22512,SCENE I,He had not wit enough to be a traitor.
22513,SCENE I,Poor thick-eyed beetle! not to have foreseen
22514,SCENE I,That he who gulled thee with a whimpered lie
22515,SCENE I,"To murder his own brother, would not scruple"
22516,SCENE I,"To murder thee, if e'er his guilt grew jealous,                    155"

22520,SCENE I,
22521,SCENE I,"_Isidore._ Oh yes, my lord!"

22913,SCENE III,_Naomi._ The cavern?
22914,SCENE III,
22915,SCENE III,"_Alhadra._           Yes, the mouth of yonder cavern                55"
22916,SCENE III,After a while I saw the son of Valdez
22917,SCENE III,Rush by with flaring torch; he likewise entered.
22918,SCENE III,There was another and a longer pause;
22919,SCENE III,"And once, methought I heard the clash of swords!"
22920,SCENE III,And soon the son of Valdez re-appeared:                             60
22921,SCENE III,"He flung his torch towards the moon in sport,"
22922,SCENE III,"And seemed as he were mirthful! I stood listening,"
22923,SCENE III,Impatient for the footsteps of my husband!
22924,SCENE III,
22925,SCENE III,_Naomi._ Thou called'st him?
22926,SCENE III,
22927,SCENE III,_Alhadra._                   I crept into the cavern--
22928,SCENE III,'Twas dark and very silent.
22929,SCENE III,What said'st thou?                      65
22930,SCENE III,"No! no! I did not dare call, Isidore,"
22931,SCENE III,"Lest I should hear no answer! A brief while,"
22932,SCENE III,"Belike, I lost all thought and memory"
22933,SCENE III,"Of that for which I came! After that pause,"
22934,SCENE III,"O Heaven! I heard a groan, and followed it:                         70"
22935,SCENE III,"And yet another groan, which guided me"
22936,SCENE III,"Into a strange recess--and there was light,"
22937,SCENE III,A hideous light! his torch lay on the ground;
22938,SCENE III,Its flame burnt dimly o'er a chasm's brink:
22939,SCENE III,"I spake; and whilst I spake, a feeble groan                         75"
22940,SCENE III,Came from that chasm! it was his last! his death-groan!
22941,SCENE III,
22942,SCENE III,"_Naomi._ Comfort her, Alla!"
22943,SCENE III,
22944,SCENE III,_Alhadra._                  I stood in unimaginable trance
22945,SCENE III,"And agony that cannot be remembered,"
22946,SCENE III,Listening with horrid hope to hear a groan!                         80
22947,SCENE III,But I had heard his last: my husband's death-groan!
22948,SCENE III,
22949,SCENE III,_Naomi._ Haste! let us onward.
22950,SCENE III,
22951,SCENE III,_Alhadra._                     I looked far down the pit--
22952,SCENE III,My sight was bounded by a jutting fragment:
22953,SCENE III,"And it was stained with blood. Then first I shrieked,"
22954,SCENE III,"My eye-balls burnt, my brain grew hot as fire,                      85"
22955,SCENE III,And all the hanging drops of the wet roof
22956,SCENE III,Turned into blood--I saw them turn to blood!
22957,SCENE III,"And I was leaping wildly down the chasm,"
22958,SCENE III,"When on the farther brink I saw his sword,"
22959,SCENE III,"And it said, Vengeance!--Curses on my tongue!                       90"
22960,SCENE III,"The moon hath moved in Heaven, and I am here,"
22961,SCENE III,And he hath not had vengeance! Isidore!
22962,SCENE III,Spirit of Isidore! thy murderer lives!

23036,SCENE I,"Circled with evil, till his very soul"

23123,SCENE I,Doth swim with love and pity--Well! Ordonio--
23124,SCENE I,"Oh my foreboding heart! And he suborned thee,"
23125,SCENE I,"And thou didst spare his life? Blessings shower on thee,"
23126,SCENE I,As many as the drops twice counted o'er

23128,SCENE I,
23129,SCENE I,_Alvar._ I can endure no more. The Moorish sorcerer

23131,SCENE I,That picture--
23132,SCENE I,
23133,SCENE I,_Teresa._      Ha! speak on!
23134,SCENE I,
23135,SCENE I,_Alvar._                     Beloved Teresa!
23136,SCENE I,It told but half the truth. O let this portrait
23137,SCENE I,Tell all--that Alvar lives--that he is here!                        85
23138,SCENE I,Thy much deceived but ever faithful Alvar.
23139,SCENE I,
23140,SCENE I,"[_Takes her portrait from his neck, and gives it her._"
23141,SCENE I,
23142,SCENE I,_Teresa (receiving the portrait)._ The same--it is the same! Ah!
23143,SCENE I,Who art thou?
23144,SCENE I,"Nay, I will call thee, Alvar!         [_She falls on his neck._"
23145,SCENE I,
23146,SCENE I,_Alvar._                      O joy unutterable!
23147,SCENE I,But hark! a sound as of removing bars
23148,SCENE I,"At the dungeon's outer door. A brief, brief while                   90"
23149,SCENE I,"Conceal thyself, my love! It is Ordonio."
23150,SCENE I,"For the honour of our race, for our dear father;"
23151,SCENE I,O for himself too (he is still my brother)
23152,SCENE I,"Let me recall him to his nobler nature,"
23153,SCENE I,That he may wake as from a dream of murder!                         95
23154,SCENE I,"O let me reconcile him to himself,"
23155,SCENE I,"Open the sacred source of penitent tears,"
23156,SCENE I,And be once more his own beloved Alvar.
23157,SCENE I,
23158,SCENE I,_Teresa._ O my all virtuous love! I fear to leave thee
23159,SCENE I,With that obdurate man.
23160,SCENE I,
23161,SCENE I,_Alvar._                Thou dost not leave me!                    100
23162,SCENE I,But a brief while retire into the darkness:
23163,SCENE I,O that my joy could spread its sunshine round thee!
23164,SCENE I,
23165,SCENE I,_Teresa._ The sound of thy voice shall be my music!
23166,SCENE I,Alvar! my Alvar! am I sure I hold thee?
23167,SCENE I,"Is it no dream? thee in my arms, my Alvar!             [_Exit._    105"
23168,SCENE I,
23169,SCENE I,"[_A noise at the Dungeon door. It opens, and ORDONIO"
23170,SCENE I,"enters, with a goblet in his hand._"
23171,SCENE I,
23172,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._ Hail, potent wizard! in my gayer mood"
23173,SCENE I,"I poured forth a libation to old Pluto,"
23174,SCENE I,"And as I brimmed the bowl, I thought on thee."
23175,SCENE I,"Thou hast conspired against my life and honour,"
23176,SCENE I,Hast tricked me foully; yet I hate thee not.                       110
23177,SCENE I,"Why should I hate thee? this same world of ours,"
23178,SCENE I,"'Tis but a pool amid a storm of rain,"
23179,SCENE I,"And we the air-bladders that course up and down,"
23180,SCENE I,And joust and tilt in merry tournament;
23181,SCENE I,"And when one bubble runs foul of another,                          115"
23182,SCENE I,The weaker needs must break.
23183,SCENE I,
23184,SCENE I,_Alvar._                     I see thy heart!
23185,SCENE I,There is a frightful glitter in thine eye
23186,SCENE I,"Which doth betray thee. Inly-tortured man,"
23187,SCENE I,"This is the revelry of a drunken anguish,"
23188,SCENE I,"Which fain would scoff away the pang of guilt,                     120"
23189,SCENE I,And quell each human feeling.
23190,SCENE I,
23191,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                    Feeling! feeling!
23192,SCENE I,The death of a man--the breaking of a bubble--
23193,SCENE I,'Tis true I cannot sob for such misfortunes;
23194,SCENE I,"But faintness, cold and hunger--curses on me"
23195,SCENE I,If willingly I e'er inflicted them!                                125
23196,SCENE I,"Come, take the beverage; this chill place demands it."
23197,SCENE I,
23198,SCENE I,[_ORDONIO proffers the goblet._
23199,SCENE I,
23200,SCENE I,"_Alvar._ Yon insect on the wall,"
23201,SCENE I,"Which moves this way and that its hundred limbs,"
23202,SCENE I,"Were it a toy of mere mechanic craft,"
23203,SCENE I,It were an infinitely curious thing!                               130
23204,SCENE I,"But it has life, Ordonio! life, enjoyment!"
23205,SCENE I,And by the power of its miraculous will
23206,SCENE I,Wields all the complex movements of its frame
23207,SCENE I,Unerringly to pleasurable ends!
23208,SCENE I,Saw I that insect on this goblet's brim                            135
23209,SCENE I,I would remove it with an anxious pity!
23210,SCENE I,
23211,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ What meanest thou?
23212,SCENE I,
23213,SCENE I,_Alvar._                      There's poison in the wine.
23214,SCENE I,
23215,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Thou hast guessed right; there's poison in the wine.
23216,SCENE I,There's poison in't--which of us two shall drink it?
23217,SCENE I,For one of us must die!
23218,SCENE I,
23219,SCENE I,_Alvar._                Whom dost thou think me?                   140
23220,SCENE I,
23221,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ The accomplice and sworn friend of Isidore.
23222,SCENE I,
23223,SCENE I,_Alvar._ I know him not.
23224,SCENE I,"And yet methinks, I have heard the name but lately."
23225,SCENE I,Means he the husband of the Moorish woman?
23226,SCENE I,Isidore? Isidore?                                                  145
23227,SCENE I,
23228,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Good! good! that lie! by heaven it has restored me.
23229,SCENE I,"Now I am thy master!--Villain! thou shalt drink it,"
23230,SCENE I,Or die a bitterer death.
23231,SCENE I,
23232,SCENE I,_Alvar._                 What strange solution
23233,SCENE I,"Hast thou found out to satisfy thy fears,"
23234,SCENE I,And drug them to unnatural sleep?
23235,SCENE I,
23236,SCENE I,"[_ALVAR takes the goblet, and throws it to the ground._"
23237,SCENE I,
23238,SCENE I,My master!                       150
23239,SCENE I,
23240,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Thou mountebank!
23241,SCENE I,
23242,SCENE I,_Alvar._                    Mountebank and villain!
23243,SCENE I,"What then art thou? For shame, put up thy sword!"
23244,SCENE I,What boots a weapon in a withered arm?
23245,SCENE I,"I fix mine eye upon thee, and thou tremblest!"
23246,SCENE I,"I speak, and fear and wonder crush thy rage,                       155"
23247,SCENE I,And turn it to a motionless distraction!
23248,SCENE I,"Thou blind self-worshipper! thy pride, thy cunning,"
23249,SCENE I,"Thy faith in universal villainy,"
23250,SCENE I,"Thy shallow sophisms, thy pretended scorn"
23251,SCENE I,For all thy human brethren--out upon them!                         160
23252,SCENE I,What have they done for thee? have they given thee peace?
23253,SCENE I,Cured thee of starting in thy sleep? or made
23254,SCENE I,The darkness pleasant when thou wak'st at midnight?
23255,SCENE I,Art happy when alone? Can'st walk by thyself
23256,SCENE I,With even step and quiet cheerfulness?                             165
23257,SCENE I,"Yet, yet thou may'st be saved----"
23258,SCENE I,
23259,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                        Saved? saved?
23260,SCENE I,
23261,SCENE I,_Alvar._                                        One pang!
23262,SCENE I,Could I call up one pang of true remorse!
23263,SCENE I,
23264,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ He told me of the babes that prattled to him.
23265,SCENE I,His fatherless little ones! remorse! remorse!
23266,SCENE I,Where got'st thou that fool's word? Curse on remorse!              170
23267,SCENE I,"Can it give up the dead, or recompact"
23268,SCENE I,A mangled body? mangled--dashed to atoms!
23269,SCENE I,Not all the blessings of a host of angels
23270,SCENE I,Can blow away a desolate widow's curse!
23271,SCENE I,"And though thou spill thy heart's blood for atonement,             175"
23272,SCENE I,It will not weigh against an orphan's tear!
23273,SCENE I,
23274,SCENE I,_Alvar._ But Alvar----
23275,SCENE I,
23276,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._             Ha! it chokes thee in the throat,"
23277,SCENE I,Even thee; and yet I pray thee speak it out.
23278,SCENE I,Still Alvar!--Alvar!--howl it in mine ear!
23279,SCENE I,"Heap it like coals of fire upon my heart,                          180"
23280,SCENE I,And shoot it hissing through my brain!
23281,SCENE I,
23282,SCENE I,_Alvar._                               Alas!
23283,SCENE I,That day when thou didst leap from off the rock
23284,SCENE I,"Into the waves, and grasped thy sinking brother,"
23285,SCENE I,"And bore him to the strand; then, son of Valdez,"
23286,SCENE I,How sweet and musical the name of Alvar!                           185
23287,SCENE I,"Then, then, Ordonio, he was dear to thee,"
23288,SCENE I,And thou wert dear to him: heaven only knows
23289,SCENE I,How very dear thou wert! Why did'st thou hate him!
23290,SCENE I,"O heaven! how he would fall upon thy neck,"
23291,SCENE I,And weep forgiveness!
23292,SCENE I,
23293,SCENE I,_Ordonio._            Spirit of the dead!                          190
23294,SCENE I,Methinks I know thee! ha! my brain turns wild
23295,SCENE I,"At its own dreams!--off--off, fantastic shadow!"
23296,SCENE I,
23297,SCENE I,"_Alvar._ I fain would tell thee what I am, but dare not!"
23298,SCENE I,
23299,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Cheat! villain! traitor! whatsoever thou be--
23300,SCENE I,"I fear thee, man!"
23301,SCENE I,
23302,SCENE I,_Teresa (rushing out and falling on Alvar's neck)._ Ordonio! 'tis
23303,SCENE I,thy brother!                                                   195
23304,SCENE I,
23305,SCENE I,[_ORDONIO runs upon ALVAR with his sword. TERESA flings
23306,SCENE I,herself on ORDONIO and arrests his arm._
23307,SCENE I,
23308,SCENE I,"Stop, madman, stop!"
23309,SCENE I,
23310,SCENE I,_Alvar._ Does then this thin disguise impenetrably
23311,SCENE I,Hide Alvar from thee? Toil and painful wounds
23312,SCENE I,"And long imprisonment in unwholesome dungeons,"
23313,SCENE I,Have marred perhaps all trait and lineament                        200
23314,SCENE I,"Of what I was! But chiefly, chiefly, brother,"
23315,SCENE I,My anguish for thy guilt!
23316,SCENE I,Ordonio--Brother!
23317,SCENE I,"Nay, nay, thou shalt embrace me."
23318,SCENE I,
23319,SCENE I,"_Ordonio (drawing back, and gazing at Alvar)._ Touch me not!"
23320,SCENE I,"Touch not pollution, Alvar! I will die."

23322,SCENE I,"[_He attempts to fall on his sword, ALVAR and TERESA"
23323,SCENE I,prevent him._
23324,SCENE I,
23325,SCENE I,"_Alvar._ We will find means to save your honour. Live,             205"
23326,SCENE I,"Oh live, Ordonio! for our father's sake!"
23327,SCENE I,Spare his grey hairs!
23328,SCENE I,
23329,SCENE I,_Teresa._             And you may yet be happy.
23330,SCENE I,
23331,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ O horror! not a thousand years in heaven
23332,SCENE I,"Could recompose this miserable heart,"
23333,SCENE I,Or make it capable of one brief joy!                               210
23334,SCENE I,Live! live! Why yes! 'Twere well to live with you:
23335,SCENE I,For is it fit a villain should be proud?
23336,SCENE I,"My brother! I will kneel to you, my brother!       [_Kneeling._"
23337,SCENE I,"Forgive me, Alvar!----Curse me with forgiveness!"
23338,SCENE I,
23339,SCENE I,"_Alvar._ Call back thy soul, Ordonio, and look round thee!         215"
23340,SCENE I,Now is the time for greatness! Think that heaven--
23341,SCENE I,
23342,SCENE I,_Teresa._ O mark his eye! he hears not what you say.
23343,SCENE I,
23344,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._ Yes, mark his eye! there's fascination in it!"
23345,SCENE I,Thou said'st thou did'st not know him--That is he!
23346,SCENE I,He comes upon me!
23347,SCENE I,
23348,SCENE I,"_Alvar._          Heal, O heal him, heaven!                        220"
23349,SCENE I,
23350,SCENE I,_Ordonio._ Nearer and nearer! and I can not stir!
23351,SCENE I,"Will no one hear these stifled groans, and wake me?"
23352,SCENE I,"He would have died to save me, and I killed him--"
23353,SCENE I,A husband and a father!--
23354,SCENE I,
23355,SCENE I,_Teresa._                 Some secret poison
23356,SCENE I,Drinks up his spirits!
23357,SCENE I,
23358,SCENE I,_Ordonio._             Let the eternal justice                     225
23359,SCENE I,Prepare my punishment in the obscure world--
23360,SCENE I,I will not bear to live--to live--O agony!
23361,SCENE I,And be myself alone my own sore torment!
23362,SCENE I,
23363,SCENE I,"[_The doors of the dungeon are broken open, and in rush"
23364,SCENE I,"ALHADRA, and the band of_ Morescoes."
23365,SCENE I,

23367,SCENE I,
23368,SCENE I,[_ALVAR presses onward to defend ORDONIO._
23369,SCENE I,
23370,SCENE I,"_Ordonio._ Off, ruffians! I have flung away my sword.              230"
23371,SCENE I,"Woman, my life is thine! to thee I give it!"
23372,SCENE I,"Off! he that touches me with his hand of flesh,"
23373,SCENE I,I'll rend his limbs asunder! I have strength
23374,SCENE I,With this bare arm to scatter you like ashes.
23375,SCENE I,
23376,SCENE I,_Alhadra._ My husband--
23377,SCENE I,
23378,SCENE I,"_Ordonio_.              Yes, I murdered him most foully.           235"
23379,SCENE I,
23380,SCENE I,_Alvar and Teresa._ O horrible!
23381,SCENE I,
23382,SCENE I,_Alhadra._                      Why did'st thou leave his children?
23383,SCENE I,"Demon, thou should'st have sent thy dogs of hell"
23384,SCENE I,"To lap their blood. Then, then I might have hardened"
23385,SCENE I,"My soul in misery, and have had comfort."
23386,SCENE I,"I would have stood far off, quiet though dark,                     240"
23387,SCENE I,And bade the race of men raise up a mourning
23388,SCENE I,"For a deep horror of desolation,"
23389,SCENE I,Too great to be one soul's particular lot!
23390,SCENE I,Brother of Zagri! let me lean upon thee.
23391,SCENE I,"The time is not yet come for woman's anguish,                      245"
23392,SCENE I,I have not seen his blood--Within an hour
23393,SCENE I,"Those little ones will crowd around and ask me,"
23394,SCENE I,Where is our father? I shall curse thee then!
23395,SCENE I,"Wert thou in heaven, my curse would pluck thee thence!"
23396,SCENE I,
23397,SCENE I,"_Teresa._ He doth repent! See, see, I kneel to thee!               250"
23398,SCENE I,"O let him live! That ag√©d man, his father----"
23399,SCENE I,
23400,SCENE I,_Alhadra._ Why had he such a son?
23401,SCENE I,
23402,SCENE I,[_Shouts from the distance of_ Rescue! Rescue! Alvar!
23403,SCENE I,Alvar! _and the voice of VALDEZ heard._

23406,SCENE I,The deed be mine!                    [_Suddenly stabs ORDONIO._
23407,SCENE I,Now take my life!

23414,SCENE I,But go! my word was pledged to thee.
23415,SCENE I,
23416,SCENE I,_Ordonio._                           Away!
23417,SCENE I,Brave not my Father's rage! I thank thee! Thou--
23418,SCENE I,
23419,SCENE I,[_Then turning his eyes languidly to ALVAR._
23420,SCENE I,
23421,SCENE I,She hath avenged the blood of Isidore!
23422,SCENE I,I stood in silence like a slave before her                         260
23423,SCENE I,"That I might taste the wormwood and the gall,"
23424,SCENE I,And satiate this self-accusing heart
23425,SCENE I,With bitterer agonies than death can give.

23744,ADVERTISEMENT,The form of the following dramatic poem is in humble imitation of the
23745,ADVERTISEMENT,"_Winter's Tale_ of Shakspeare, except that I have called the first part"
23746,ADVERTISEMENT,"a Prelude instead of a first Act, as a somewhat nearer resemblance to"
23747,ADVERTISEMENT,"the plan of the ancients, of which one specimen is left us in the"
23748,ADVERTISEMENT,"√Üschylean Trilogy of the _Agamemnon_, the _Orestes_, and the"
23749,ADVERTISEMENT,"_Eumenides_. Though a matter of form merely, yet two plays, on different"
23750,ADVERTISEMENT,"periods of the same tale, might seem less bold, than an interval of"
23751,ADVERTISEMENT,"twenty years between a first and second act. This is, however, in mere"
23752,ADVERTISEMENT,"obedience to custom. The effect does not, in reality, at all depend on"
23753,ADVERTISEMENT,the Time of the interval; but on a very different principle. There are
23754,ADVERTISEMENT,cases in which an interval of twenty hours between the acts would have a
23755,ADVERTISEMENT,worse effect (_i. e._ render the imagination less disposed to take the
23756,ADVERTISEMENT,"position required) than twenty years in other cases. For the rest, I"
23757,ADVERTISEMENT,"shall be well content if my readers will take it up, read and judge it,"
23758,ADVERTISEMENT,as a Christmas tale.

23805,SCENE I,Lo! e'en this eager and unwonted haste
23806,SCENE I,"But agitates, not quells, its majesty.                               5"
23807,SCENE I,"My patron! my commander! yes, 'tis he!"
23808,SCENE I,Call out the guards. The Lord Kiuprili comes.
23809,SCENE I,
23810,SCENE I,"[_Drums beat, &c., the_ Guard _turns out._"
23811,SCENE I,
23812,SCENE I,_Enter RAAB KIUPRILI._
23813,SCENE I,
23814,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili (making a signal to stop the drums, &c.)._ Silence!"
23815,SCENE I,"enough! This is no time, young friend,"
23816,SCENE I,"For ceremonious dues. The summoning drum,"
23817,SCENE I,"Th' air-shattering trumpet, and the horseman's clatter,             10"
23818,SCENE I,Are insults to a dying sovereign's ear.
23819,SCENE I,"Soldiers, 'tis well! Retire! your General greets you,"
23820,SCENE I,His loyal fellow-warriors.                    [_Guards retire._
23821,SCENE I,
23822,SCENE I,_Chef Ragozzi._            Pardon my surprise.
23823,SCENE I,"Thus sudden from the camp, and unattended!"
23824,SCENE I,What may these wonders prophesy?
23825,SCENE I,
23826,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._                 Tell me first,                     15"
23827,SCENE I,How fares the king? His majesty still lives?
23828,SCENE I,
23829,SCENE I,_Chef Ragozzi._ We know no otherwise; but Emerick's friends
23830,SCENE I,(And none but they approach him) scoff at hope.
23831,SCENE I,
23832,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ Ragozzi! I have reared thee from a child,"
23833,SCENE I,And as a child I have reared thee. Whence this air                  20
23834,SCENE I,Of mystery? That face was wont to open
23835,SCENE I,"Clear as the morning to me, shewing all things."
23836,SCENE I,Hide nothing from me.
23837,SCENE I,
23838,SCENE I,"_Chef Ragozzi._       O most loved, most honoured,"
23839,SCENE I,The mystery that struggles in my looks
23840,SCENE I,"Betrayed my whole tale to thee, if it told thee                     25"
23841,SCENE I,That I am ignorant; but fear the worst.
23842,SCENE I,And mystery is contagious. All things here
23843,SCENE I,Are full of motion: and yet all is silent:
23844,SCENE I,And bad men's hopes infect the good with fears.
23845,SCENE I,
23846,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._ I have trembling proof within how true thou
23847,SCENE I,speakest.                                                       30
23848,SCENE I,
23849,SCENE I,"_Chef Ragozzi._ That the prince Emerick feasts the soldiery,"
23850,SCENE I,"Gives splendid arms, pays the commanders' debts,"
23851,SCENE I,And (it is whispered) by sworn promises
23852,SCENE I,"Makes himself debtor--hearing this, thou hast heard"
23853,SCENE I,All----                                                             35
23854,SCENE I,But what my lord will learn too soon himself.
23855,SCENE I,
23856,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ Ha!--Well then, let it come! Worse scarce can come."
23857,SCENE I,This letter written by the trembling hand
23858,SCENE I,Of royal Andreas calls me from the camp
23859,SCENE I,"To his immediate presence. It appoints me,                          40"
23860,SCENE I,"The Queen, and Emerick, guardians of the realm,"
23861,SCENE I,"And of the royal infant. Day by day,"
23862,SCENE I,"Robbed of Zapolya's soothing cares, the king"
23863,SCENE I,"Yearns only to behold one precious boon,"
23864,SCENE I,And with his life breathe forth a father's blessing.                45
23865,SCENE I,
23866,SCENE I,"_Chef Ragozzi._ Remember you, my lord! that Hebrew leech"
23867,SCENE I,Whose face so much distempered you?
23868,SCENE I,
23869,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._                    Barzoni?
23870,SCENE I,I held him for a spy; but the proof failing
23871,SCENE I,"(More courteously, I own, than pleased myself),"
23872,SCENE I,I sent him from the camp.
23873,SCENE I,
23874,SCENE I,"_Chef Ragozzi._           To him, in chief,                         50"
23875,SCENE I,Prince Emerick trusts his royal brother's health.
23876,SCENE I,
23877,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ Hide nothing, I conjure you! What of him?"
23878,SCENE I,
23879,SCENE I,"_Chef Ragozzi._ With pomp of words beyond a soldier's cunning,"
23880,SCENE I,"And shrugs and wrinkled brow, he smiles and whispers!"
23881,SCENE I,Talks in dark words of women's fancies; hints                       55
23882,SCENE I,That 'twere a useless and a cruel zeal
23883,SCENE I,"To rob a dying man of any hope,"
23884,SCENE I,"However vain, that soothes him: and, in fine,"
23885,SCENE I,Denies all chance of offspring from the Queen.
23886,SCENE I,
23887,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ The venomous snake! My heel was on its head,       60"
23888,SCENE I,And (fool!) I did not crush it!
23889,SCENE I,
23890,SCENE I,"_Chef Ragozzi._                 Nay, he fears"
23891,SCENE I,Zapolya will not long survive her husband.
23892,SCENE I,
23893,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._ Manifest treason! Even this brief delay
23894,SCENE I,"Half makes me an accomplice----(If he live,)"
23895,SCENE I,
23896,SCENE I,[_Is moving toward the palace._
23897,SCENE I,
23898,SCENE I,"If he but live and know me, all may----"
23899,SCENE I,
23900,SCENE I,_Chef Ragozzi._                         Halt!     [_Stops him._     65
23901,SCENE I,"On pain of death, my Lord! am I commanded"
23902,SCENE I,To stop all ingress to the palace.
23903,SCENE I,
23904,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._                   Thou!
23905,SCENE I,
23906,SCENE I,"_Chef Ragozzi._ No place, no name, no rank excepted--"
23907,SCENE I,
23908,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._                                      Thou!
23909,SCENE I,
23910,SCENE I,"_Chef Ragozzi._ This life of mine, O take it, Lord Kiuprili!"
23911,SCENE I,"I give it as a weapon to thy hands,                                 70"
23912,SCENE I,"Mine own no longer. Guardian of Illyria,"
23913,SCENE I,"Useless to thee, 'tis worthless to myself."
23914,SCENE I,Thou art the framer of my nobler being;
23915,SCENE I,"Nor does there live one virtue in my soul,"
23916,SCENE I,"One honourable hope, but calls thee father.                         75"
23917,SCENE I,"Yet ere thou dost resolve, know that yon palace"
23918,SCENE I,"Is guarded from within, that each access"
23919,SCENE I,"Is thronged by armed conspirators, watched by ruffians"
23920,SCENE I,"Pampered with gifts, and hot upon the spoil"
23921,SCENE I,Which that false promiser still trails before them.                 80
23922,SCENE I,I ask but this one boon--reserve my life
23923,SCENE I,Till I can lose it for the realm and thee!
23924,SCENE I,
23925,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ My heart is rent asunder. O my country,"
23926,SCENE I,"O fallen Illyria, stand I here spell-bound?"
23927,SCENE I,Did my King love me? Did I earn his love?                           85
23928,SCENE I,Have we embraced as brothers would embrace?
23929,SCENE I,"Was I his arm, his thunder-bolt? And now"
23930,SCENE I,"Must I, hag-ridden, pant as in a dream?"
23931,SCENE I,"Or, like an eagle, whose strong wings press up"
23932,SCENE I,"Against a coiling serpent's folds, can I                            90"
23933,SCENE I,"Strike but for mockery, and with restless beak"
23934,SCENE I,"Gore my own breast?--Ragozzi, thou art faithful?"
23935,SCENE I,
23936,SCENE I,_Chef Ragozzi._ Here before Heaven I dedicate my faith
23937,SCENE I,To the royal line of Andreas.
23938,SCENE I,
23939,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._              Hark, Ragozzi!"
23940,SCENE I,Guilt is a timorous thing ere perpetration:                         95
23941,SCENE I,Despair alone makes wicked men be bold.
23942,SCENE I,"Come thou with me! They have heard my voice in flight,"
23943,SCENE I,"Have faced round, terror-struck, and feared no longer"
23944,SCENE I,The whistling javelins of their fell pursuers.
23945,SCENE I,Ha! what is this?
23946,SCENE I,
23947,SCENE I,[_Black flag displayed from the Tower of the Palace: a
23948,SCENE I,"death-bell tolls, &c._"
23949,SCENE I,
23950,SCENE I,Vengeance of Heaven! He is dead.                 100
23951,SCENE I,
23952,SCENE I,"_Chef Ragozzi._ At length then 'tis announced. Alas! I fear,"
23953,SCENE I,That these black death-flags are but treason's signals.
23954,SCENE I,
23955,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._ A prophecy too soon fulfilled! See yonder!
23956,SCENE I,O rank and ravenous wolves! the death-bell echoes
23957,SCENE I,Still in the doleful air--and see! they come.                      105
23958,SCENE I,
23959,SCENE I,_Chef Ragozzi._ Precise and faithful in their villainy
23960,SCENE I,"Even to the moment, that the master traitor"
23961,SCENE I,Had pre-ordained them.
23962,SCENE I,
23963,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._       Was it over-haste,"
23964,SCENE I,"Or is it scorn, that in this race of treason"
23965,SCENE I,"Their guilt thus drops its mask, and blazons forth                 110"
23966,SCENE I,Their infamous plot even to an idiot's sense?
23967,SCENE I,
23968,SCENE I,_Chef Ragozzi._ Doubtless they deem Heaven too usurp'd! Heaven's
23969,SCENE I,justice
23970,SCENE I,Bought like themselves!
23971,SCENE I,"Being equal all in crime,"
23972,SCENE I,"Do you press on, ye spotted parricides!"
23973,SCENE I,"For the one sole pre-eminence yet doubtful,                        115"
23974,SCENE I,The prize of foremost impudence in guilt?
23975,SCENE I,
23976,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._ The bad man's cunning still prepares the way
23977,SCENE I,"For its own outwitting. I applaud, Ragozzi!"
23978,SCENE I,"Ragozzi! I applaud,"
23979,SCENE I,"In thee, the virtuous hope that dares look onward"
23980,SCENE I,And keeps the life-spark warm of future action                     120
23981,SCENE I,Beneath the cloak of patient sufferance.
23982,SCENE I,"Act and appear, as time and prudence prompt thee:"
23983,SCENE I,I shall not misconceive the part thou playest.
23984,SCENE I,Mine is an easier part--to brave the usurper.

23995,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ Grave magistrates and chieftains of Illyria,"
23996,SCENE I,"In good time come ye hither, if ye come"
23997,SCENE I,As loyal men with honourable purpose

23999,SCENE I,To enforce the last commands of royal Andreas                      130

24002,SCENE I,
24003,SCENE I,_Leader._ Our purpose demands speed. Grace our procession;

24011,SCENE I,[_Voices of_ Live KING EMERICK! an EMERICK! an EMERICK!
24012,SCENE I,
24013,SCENE I,What means this clamour? Are these madmen's voices?
24014,SCENE I,Or is some knot of riotous slanderers leagued                      140
24015,SCENE I,To infamize the name of the king's brother
24016,SCENE I,"With a lie black as Hell? unmanly cruelty,"
24017,SCENE I,"Ingratitude, and most unnatural treason?            [_Murmurs._"
24018,SCENE I,What mean these murmurs? Dare then any here
24019,SCENE I,Proclaim Prince Emerick a spotted traitor?                         145
24020,SCENE I,"One that has taken from you your sworn faith,"
24021,SCENE I,"And given you in return a Judas' bribe,"

24026,SCENE I,Prince! No Changelings!

24032,SCENE I,"Fought with the foe, and stained its jagged points"
24033,SCENE I,With gore from wounds I felt not? Did the blast                    155
24034,SCENE I,"Beat on this body, frost-and-famine-numbed,"
24035,SCENE I,Till my hard flesh distinguished not itself
24036,SCENE I,"From the insensate mail, its fellow warrior?"
24037,SCENE I,"And have I brought home with me Victory,"

24120,SCENE I,

24144,SCENE I,[_Music recommences.--The Procession passes into the
24145,SCENE I,Palace._
24146,SCENE I,
24147,SCENE I,_Emerick._ What? Raab Kiuprili? What? a father's sword
24148,SCENE I,Against his own son's breast?
24149,SCENE I,
24150,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._              'Twould best excuse him,"
24151,SCENE I,"Were he thy son, Prince Emerick. I abjure him."
24152,SCENE I,
24153,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ This is my thanks, then, that I have commenced"
24154,SCENE I,A reign to which the free voice of the nobles                      235
24155,SCENE I,"Hath called me, and the people, by regards"
24156,SCENE I,Of love and grace to Raab Kiuprili's house?

24160,SCENE I,
24161,SCENE I,_Emerick._ By what right dares Kiuprili question me?
24162,SCENE I,
24163,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._ By a right common to all loyal subjects--         240
24164,SCENE I,"To me a duty! As the realm's co-regent,"
24165,SCENE I,"Appointed by our sovereign's last free act,"
24166,SCENE I,Writ by himself.--                      [_Grasping the Patent._

24169,SCENE I,
24170,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ I likewise ask, by whose authority"
24171,SCENE I,The access to the sovereign was refused me?                        245
24172,SCENE I,
24173,SCENE I,_Emerick._ By whose authority dared the general leave

24179,SCENE I,To be belated in a loyal purpose--
24180,SCENE I,"At the command, Prince! of my king and thine,"
24181,SCENE I,Hither I came; and now again require
24182,SCENE I,Audience of Queen Zapolya; and (the States
24183,SCENE I,"Forthwith convened) that thou dost shew at large,                  255"
24184,SCENE I,On what ground of defect thou'st dared annul
24185,SCENE I,This thy King's last and solemn act--hast dared
24186,SCENE I,"Ascend the throne, of which the law had named,"
24187,SCENE I,"And conscience should have made thee, a protector."
24188,SCENE I,
24189,SCENE I,_Emerick._ A sovereign's ear ill brooks a subject's questioning!   260
24190,SCENE I,Yet for thy past well-doing--and because
24191,SCENE I,'Tis hard to erase at once the fond belief
24192,SCENE I,"Long cherished, that Illyria had in thee"

24198,SCENE I,
24199,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._                  Prince! I listen.
24200,SCENE I,
24201,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ Unwillingly I tell thee, that Zapolya,"
24202,SCENE I,"Maddened with grief, her erring hopes proved idle--                270"
24203,SCENE I,
24204,SCENE I,"_Casimir._ Sire! speak the whole truth! Say, her fraud detected!"
24205,SCENE I,
24206,SCENE I,_Emerick._ According to the sworn attests in council
24207,SCENE I,Of her physician----
24208,SCENE I,
24209,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili (aside)._ Yes! the Jew, Barzoni!"
24210,SCENE I,
24211,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ Under the imminent risk of death she lies,"
24212,SCENE I,"Or irrecoverable loss of reason,                                   275"

24218,SCENE I,"Even for his own fair fame, his grace prays hourly"

24221,SCENE I,
24222,SCENE I,"_Emerick._                           Right, Casimir!"
24223,SCENE I,"Receive my pledge, lord general. It shall stand"
24224,SCENE I,In her own will to appear and voice her claims;
24225,SCENE I,Or (which in truth I hold the wiser course)
24226,SCENE I,"With all the past passed by, as family quarrels,                   285"
24227,SCENE I,"Let the Queen Dowager, with unblenched honours,"
24228,SCENE I,"Resume her state, our first Illyrian matron."
24229,SCENE I,
24230,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ Prince Emerick! you speak fairly, and your pledge"
24231,SCENE I,too
24232,SCENE I,"Is such, as well would suit an honest meaning."
24233,SCENE I,
24234,SCENE I,_Casimir._ My lord! you scarce know half his grace's goodness.     290
24235,SCENE I,"The wealthy heiress, high-born fair Sarolta,"
24236,SCENE I,"Bred in the convent of our noble ladies,"
24237,SCENE I,"Her relative, the venerable abbess,"
24238,SCENE I,"Hath, at his grace's urgence, wooed and won for me."
24239,SCENE I,
24240,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ Long may the race, and long may that name flourish,     295"
24241,SCENE I,"Which your heroic deeds, brave chief, have rendered"
24242,SCENE I,Dear and illustrious to all true Illyrians.
24243,SCENE I,
24244,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._ The longest line that ever tracing herald
24245,SCENE I,"Or found or feigned, placed by a beggar's soul"
24246,SCENE I,Hath but a mushroom's date in the comparison:                      300
24247,SCENE I,"And with the soul, the conscience is coeval,"
24248,SCENE I,"Yea, the soul's essence."
24249,SCENE I,
24250,SCENE I,"_Emerick._               Conscience, good my lord,"
24251,SCENE I,"Is but the pulse of reason. Is it conscience,"
24252,SCENE I,"That a free nation should be handed down,"
24253,SCENE I,"Like the dull clods beneath our feet, by chance                    305"
24254,SCENE I,"And the blind law of lineage? That whether infant,"
24255,SCENE I,"Or man matured, a wise man or an idiot,"
24256,SCENE I,"Hero or natural coward, shall have guidance"
24257,SCENE I,"Of a free people's destiny, should fall out"
24258,SCENE I,"In the mere lottery of a reckless nature,                          310"
24259,SCENE I,Where few the prizes and the blanks are countless?
24260,SCENE I,Or haply that a nation's fate should hang
24261,SCENE I,On the bald accident of a midwife's handling
24262,SCENE I,The unclosed sutures of an infant's skull?
24263,SCENE I,
24264,SCENE I,_Casimir._ What better claim can sovereign wish or need            315
24265,SCENE I,Than the free voice of men who love their country?
24266,SCENE I,"Those chiefly who have fought for't? Who by right,"
24267,SCENE I,"Claim for their monarch one, who having obeyed,"
24268,SCENE I,"So hath best learnt to govern; who, having suffered,"
24269,SCENE I,Can feel for each brave sufferer and reward him?                   320

24290,SCENE I,What further pledge or proof desires Kiuprili?
24291,SCENE I,"Then, with your assent----"
24292,SCENE I,
24293,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._           Mistake not for assent
24294,SCENE I,The unquiet silence of a stern resolve
24295,SCENE I,"Throttling the impatient voice. I have heard thee, Prince!         335"
24296,SCENE I,"And I have watched thee, too; but have small faith in"
24297,SCENE I,A plausible tale told with a flitting eye.

24306,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ Ha, ha!--Well, Sir!--Conclude your homily."
24307,SCENE I,
24308,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ A tale which, whether true or false, comes guarded"
24309,SCENE I,"Against all means of proof, detects itself."
24310,SCENE I,The Queen mew'd up--this too from anxious care                     345

24319,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ Had'st thou believed thine own tale, had'st thou"

24321,SCENE I,"Thyself the rightful successor of Andreas,"
24322,SCENE I,Would'st thou have pilfered from our school-boys' themes
24323,SCENE I,These shallow sophisms of a popular choice?
24324,SCENE I,"What people? How convened? or, if convened,                        355"
24325,SCENE I,Must not the magic power that charms together

24335,SCENE I,"In its majestic channel, is man's task"
24336,SCENE I,And the true patriot's glory! In all else

24339,SCENE I,"Where folly is contagious, and too oft                             370"
24340,SCENE I,Even wise men leave their better sense at home

24772,SCENE I,Enter LADY SAROLTA and GLYCINE._
24773,SCENE I,
24774,SCENE I,_Glycine._ Well then! our round of charity is finished.
24775,SCENE I,"Rest, Madam! You breathe quick."
24776,SCENE I,
24777,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                      What, tired, Glycine?"
24778,SCENE I,"No delicate court-dame, but a mountaineer"
24779,SCENE I,"By choice no less than birth, I gladly use"
24780,SCENE I,The good strength Nature gave me.
24781,SCENE I,
24782,SCENE I,_Glycine._                        That last cottage                  5
24783,SCENE I,Is built as if an eagle or a raven
24784,SCENE I,Had chosen it for her nest.
24785,SCENE I,
24786,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                  So many are
24787,SCENE I,"The sufferings which no human aid can reach,"
24788,SCENE I,It needs must be a duty doubly sweet
24789,SCENE I,To heal the few we can. Well! let us rest.                          10
24790,SCENE I,
24791,SCENE I,_Glycine._ There?            [_Pointing to BATHORY'S dwelling._
24792,SCENE I,
24793,SCENE I,_Sarolta._        Here! For on this spot Lord Casimir
24794,SCENE I,Took his last leave. On yonder mountain-ridge
24795,SCENE I,I lost the misty image which so long
24796,SCENE I,"Lingered, or seemed at least to linger on it."
24797,SCENE I,
24798,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ And what if even now, on that same ridge,                15"
24799,SCENE I,"A speck should rise, and still enlarging, lengthening,"
24800,SCENE I,"As it clomb downwards, shape itself at last"
24801,SCENE I,"To a numerous cavalcade, and spurring foremost,"
24802,SCENE I,Who but Sarolta's own dear lord returned
24803,SCENE I,From his high embassy?
24804,SCENE I,
24805,SCENE I,_Sarolta._             Thou hast hit my thought!                    20
24806,SCENE I,"All the long day, from yester-morn to evening,"
24807,SCENE I,The restless hope fluttered about my heart.
24808,SCENE I,Oh we are querulous creatures! Little less
24809,SCENE I,Than all things can suffice to make us happy;
24810,SCENE I,And little more than nothing is enough                              25
24811,SCENE I,"To discontent us.--Were he come, then should I"
24812,SCENE I,Repine he had not arrived just one day earlier
24813,SCENE I,"To keep his birth-day here, in his own birth-place."
24814,SCENE I,
24815,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ But our best sports belike, and gay processions"
24816,SCENE I,Would to my lord have seemed but work-day sights                    30
24817,SCENE I,Compared with those the royal court affords.
24818,SCENE I,
24819,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ I have small wish to see them. A spring morning
24820,SCENE I,With its wild gladsome minstrelsy of birds
24821,SCENE I,And its bright jewelry of flowers and dew-drops
24822,SCENE I,(Each orb√©d drop an orb of glory in it)                             35
24823,SCENE I,Would put them all in eclipse. This sweet retirement
24824,SCENE I,Lord Casimir's wish alone would have made sacred:
24825,SCENE I,"But, in good truth, his loving jealousy"
24826,SCENE I,"Did but command, what I had else entreated."
24827,SCENE I,
24828,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ And yet had I been born Lady Sarolta,                    40"
24829,SCENE I,"Been wedded to the noblest of the realm,"
24830,SCENE I,"So beautiful besides, and yet so stately----"
24831,SCENE I,
24832,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ Hush! Innocent flatterer!
24833,SCENE I,
24834,SCENE I,_Glycine._                           Nay! to my poor fancy
24835,SCENE I,"The royal court would seem an earthly heaven,"
24836,SCENE I,"Made for such stars to shine in, and be gracious.                   45"
24837,SCENE I,
24838,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ So doth the ignorant distance still delude us!
24839,SCENE I,"Thy fancied heaven, dear girl, like that above thee,"
24840,SCENE I,"In its mere self cold, drear, colourless void,"
24841,SCENE I,"Seen from below and in the large, becomes"
24842,SCENE I,"The bright blue ether, and the seat of gods!                        50"
24843,SCENE I,Well! but this broil that scared you from the dance?
24844,SCENE I,"And was not Laska there: he, your betrothed?"
24845,SCENE I,
24846,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Yes, madam! he was there. So was the maypole,"
24847,SCENE I,For we danced round it.
24848,SCENE I,
24849,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._              Ah, Glycine! why,"
24850,SCENE I,Why did you then betroth yourself?
24851,SCENE I,
24852,SCENE I,_Glycine._                         Because                          55
24853,SCENE I,My own dear lady wished it! 'twas you asked me!
24854,SCENE I,
24855,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ Yes, at my lord's request, but never wished,"
24856,SCENE I,"My poor affectionate girl, to see thee wretched."
24857,SCENE I,Thou knowest not yet the duties of a wife.
24858,SCENE I,
24859,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Oh, yes! It is a wife's chief duty, madam!               60"
24860,SCENE I,"To stand in awe of her husband, and obey him,"
24861,SCENE I,"And, I am sure, I never shall see Laska"
24862,SCENE I,But I shall tremble.
24863,SCENE I,
24864,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._           Not with fear, I think,"
24865,SCENE I,For you still mock him. Bring a seat from the cottage.
24866,SCENE I,
24867,SCENE I,"[_Exit GLYCINE into the cottage, SAROLTA continues her"

24869,SCENE I,
24870,SCENE I,"Something above thy rank there hangs about thee,                    65"
24871,SCENE I,"And in thy countenance, thy voice, and motion,"
24872,SCENE I,"Yea, e'en in thy simplicity, Glycine,"
24873,SCENE I,"A fine and feminine grace, that makes me feel"
24874,SCENE I,More as a mother than a mistress to thee!
24875,SCENE I,"Thou art a soldier's orphan! that--the courage,                     70"
24876,SCENE I,"Which rising in thine eye, seems oft to give"
24877,SCENE I,"A new soul to its gentleness, doth prove thee!"
24878,SCENE I,"Thou art sprung too of no ignoble blood,"
24879,SCENE I,Or there's no faith in instinct!

24886,SCENE I,"And my lord's steward, Laska, at their head,"
24887,SCENE I,"Have come to search for old Bathory's son,"
24888,SCENE I,"Bethlen, that brave young man! 'twas he, my lady,"
24889,SCENE I,"That took our parts, and beat off the intruders,"
24890,SCENE I,"And in mere spite and malice, now they charge him                   80"
24891,SCENE I,With bad words of Lord Casimir and the king.
24892,SCENE I,"Pray don't believe them, madam! This way! This way!"
24893,SCENE I,Lady Sarolta's here.--                      [_Calling without._
24894,SCENE I,
24895,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._             Be calm, Glycine."

24897,SCENE I,_Enter LASKA and_ Servants _with OLD BATHORY._
24898,SCENE I,
24899,SCENE I,_Laska (to Bathory)._ We have no concern with you! What needs your
24900,SCENE I,presence?
24901,SCENE I,
24902,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._ What! Do you think I'll suffer my brave boy          85
24903,SCENE I,"To be slandered by a set of coward-ruffians,"
24904,SCENE I,"And leave it to their malice,--yes, mere malice!--"
24905,SCENE I,To tell its own tale?
24906,SCENE I,
24907,SCENE I,[_LASKA and_ Servants _bow to Lady SAROLTA._
24908,SCENE I,
24909,SCENE I,_Sarolta._            Laska! What may this mean?
24910,SCENE I,
24911,SCENE I,_Laska._ Madam! and may it please your ladyship!
24912,SCENE I,"This old man's son, by name Bethlen Bathory,                        90"
24913,SCENE I,"Stands charged, on weighty evidence, that he,"
24914,SCENE I,"On yester-eve, being his lordship's birth-day,"
24915,SCENE I,Did traitorously defame Lord Casimir:
24916,SCENE I,"The lord high steward of the realm, moreover----"
24917,SCENE I,
24918,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ Be brief! We know his titles!
24919,SCENE I,
24920,SCENE I,_Laska._                                 And moreover               95
24921,SCENE I,Raved like a traitor at our liege King Emerick.
24922,SCENE I,"And furthermore, said witnesses make oath,"
24923,SCENE I,Led on the assault upon his lordship's servants;
24924,SCENE I,"Yea, insolently tore, from this, your huntsman,"
24925,SCENE I,"His badge of livery of your noble house,                           100"
24926,SCENE I,And trampled it in scorn.
24927,SCENE I,
24928,SCENE I,_Sarolta (to the Servants who offer to speak)._ You have had your
24929,SCENE I,spokesman!
24930,SCENE I,Where is the young man thus accused?
24931,SCENE I,
24932,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._                       I know not:
24933,SCENE I,"But if no ill betide him on the mountains,"
24934,SCENE I,He will not long be absent!
24935,SCENE I,
24936,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                  Thou art his father?                   105
24937,SCENE I,
24938,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._ None ever with more reason prized a son;
24939,SCENE I,Yet I hate falsehood more than I love him.
24940,SCENE I,"But more than one, now in my lady's presence,"
24941,SCENE I,"Witnessed the affray, besides these men of malice;"
24942,SCENE I,And if I swerve from truth----
24943,SCENE I,
24944,SCENE I,_Glycine._                     Yes! good old man!                  110
24945,SCENE I,My lady! pray believe him!
24946,SCENE I,
24947,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                 Hush, Glycine"
24948,SCENE I,"Be silent, I command you.                   [_Then to BATHORY._"
24949,SCENE I,Speak! we hear you!
24950,SCENE I,
24951,SCENE I,"_Old Bathory._ My tale is brief. During our festive dance,"
24952,SCENE I,"Your servants, the accusers of my son,"
24953,SCENE I,"Offered gross insults, in unmanly sort,                            115"
24954,SCENE I,To our village maidens. He (could he do less?)
24955,SCENE I,"Rose in defence of outraged modesty,"
24956,SCENE I,"And so persuasive did his cudgel prove,"
24957,SCENE I,(Your hectoring sparks so over-brave to women
24958,SCENE I,"Are always cowards) that they soon took flight,                    120"
24959,SCENE I,"And now in mere revenge, like baffled boasters,"
24960,SCENE I,"Have framed this tale, out of some hasty words"
24961,SCENE I,Which their own threats provoked.
24962,SCENE I,
24963,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                        Old man! you talk
24964,SCENE I,Too bluntly! Did your son owe no respect
24965,SCENE I,To the livery of our house?
24966,SCENE I,
24967,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._              Even such respect                      125
24968,SCENE I,As the sheep's skin should gain for the hot wolf
24969,SCENE I,That hath begun to worry the poor lambs!
24970,SCENE I,
24971,SCENE I,_Laska._ Old insolent ruffian!
24972,SCENE I,
24973,SCENE I,"_Glycine._                     Pardon! pardon, madam!"
24974,SCENE I,I saw the whole affray. The good old man
24975,SCENE I,"Means no offence, sweet lady!--You, yourself,                      130"
24976,SCENE I,"Laska! know well, that these men were the ruffians!"
24977,SCENE I,Shame on you!
24978,SCENE I,
24979,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._    What! Glycine? Go, retire!       [_Exit GLYCINE._"
24980,SCENE I,"Be it then that these men faulted. Yet yourself,"
24981,SCENE I,"Or better still belike the maidens' parents,"
24982,SCENE I,Might have complained to us. Was ever access                       135
24983,SCENE I,Denied you? Or free audience? Or are we
24984,SCENE I,Weak and unfit to punish our own servants?
24985,SCENE I,
24986,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._ So then! So then! Heaven grant an old man patience!
24987,SCENE I,"And must the gardener leave his seedling plants,"
24988,SCENE I,Leave his young roses to the rooting swine                         140
24989,SCENE I,"While he goes ask their master, if perchance"
24990,SCENE I,His leisure serve to scourge them from their ravage?
24991,SCENE I,
24992,SCENE I,_Laska._ Ho! Take the rude clown from your lady's presence!
24993,SCENE I,I will report her further will!
24994,SCENE I,
24995,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                      Wait then,"
24996,SCENE I,Till thou hast learnt it! Fervent good old man!                    145
24997,SCENE I,"Forgive me that, to try thee, I put on"
24998,SCENE I,"A face of sternness, alien to my meaning!"
24999,SCENE I,
25000,SCENE I,[_Then speaks to the_ Servants.
25001,SCENE I,
25002,SCENE I,"Hence! leave my presence! and you, Laska! mark me!"
25003,SCENE I,Those rioters are no longer of my household!
25004,SCENE I,If we but shake a dewdrop from a rose                              150
25005,SCENE I,"In vain would we replace it, and as vainly"
25006,SCENE I,Restore the tear of wounded modesty
25007,SCENE I,To a maiden's eye familiarized to licence.--
25008,SCENE I,"But these men, Laska--"
25009,SCENE I,
25010,SCENE I,"_Laska (aside)._       Yes, now 'tis coming."
25011,SCENE I,
25012,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ Brutal aggressors first, then baffled dastards,         155"
25013,SCENE I,That they have sought to piece out their revenge
25014,SCENE I,With a tale of words lured from the lips of anger
25015,SCENE I,Stamps them most dangerous; and till I want
25016,SCENE I,"Fit means for wicked ends, we shall not need"
25017,SCENE I,"Their services. Discharge them! You, Bathory!                      160"
25018,SCENE I,Are henceforth of my household! I shall place you
25019,SCENE I,"Near my own person. When your son returns,"
25020,SCENE I,Present him to us!
25021,SCENE I,
25022,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._     Ha! what strangers here!
25023,SCENE I,[906:1]What business have they in an old man's eye?
25024,SCENE I,"Your goodness, lady--and it came so sudden--                       165"
25025,SCENE I,I can not--must not--let you be deceived.
25026,SCENE I,"I have yet another tale, but--        [_Then to SAROLTA aside._"
25027,SCENE I,not for all ears!
25028,SCENE I,
25029,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ I oft have passed your cottage, and still praised"
25030,SCENE I,"Its beauty, and that trim orchard-plot, whose blossoms"
25031,SCENE I,The gusts of April showered aslant its thatch.                     170
25032,SCENE I,"Come, you shall show it me! And, while you bid it"
25033,SCENE I,"Farewell, be not ashamed that I should witness"
25034,SCENE I,The oil of gladness glittering on the water
25035,SCENE I,Of an ebbing grief.      [_BATHORY shows her into his cottage._
25036,SCENE I,
25037,SCENE I,_Laska (alone)._    Vexation! baffled! school'd!
25038,SCENE I,Ho! Laska! wake! why? what can all this mean?                      175
25039,SCENE I,She sent away that cockatrice in anger!
25040,SCENE I,"Oh the false witch! It is too plain, she loves him."
25041,SCENE I,"And now, the old man near my lady's person,"
25042,SCENE I,She'll see this Bethlen hourly!
25043,SCENE I,
25044,SCENE I,[_LASKA flings himself into the seat. GLYCINE peeps in._
25045,SCENE I,
25046,SCENE I,_Glycine._                      Laska! Laska!
25047,SCENE I,Is my lady gone?
25048,SCENE I,
25049,SCENE I,_Laska._         Gone.
25050,SCENE I,
25051,SCENE I,_Glycine._             Have you yet seen him?                      180
25052,SCENE I,Is he returned?                             [_LASKA starts up._
25053,SCENE I,"Has the seat stung you, Laska?"
25054,SCENE I,
25055,SCENE I,"_Laska._ No, serpent! no; 'tis you that sting me; you!"
25056,SCENE I,What! you would cling to him again?
25057,SCENE I,
25058,SCENE I,_Glycine._                          Whom?
25059,SCENE I,
25060,SCENE I,_Laska._                                  Bethlen! Bethlen!
25061,SCENE I,Yes; gaze as if your very eyes embraced him!                       185
25062,SCENE I,Ha! you forget the scene of yesterday!
25063,SCENE I,"Mute ere he came, but then--Out on your screams,"
25064,SCENE I,And your pretended fears!
25065,SCENE I,
25066,SCENE I,"_Glycine._                Your fears, at least,"
25067,SCENE I,"Were real, Laska! or your trembling limbs"
25068,SCENE I,And white cheeks played the hypocrites most vilely!                190
25069,SCENE I,
25070,SCENE I,_Laska._ I fear! whom? what?
25071,SCENE I,
25072,SCENE I,"_Glycine._                   I know what I should fear,"
25073,SCENE I,Were I in Laska's place.
25074,SCENE I,
25075,SCENE I,_Laska._                 What?
25076,SCENE I,
25077,SCENE I,"_Glycine._                     My own conscience,"
25078,SCENE I,For having fed my jealousy and envy
25079,SCENE I,"With a plot, made out of other men's revenges,"
25080,SCENE I,Against a brave and innocent young man's life!                     195
25081,SCENE I,"Yet, yet, pray tell me!"
25082,SCENE I,
25083,SCENE I,_Laska._                You will know too soon.
25084,SCENE I,
25085,SCENE I,_Glycine._ Would I could find my lady! though she chid me--
25086,SCENE I,Yet this suspense--                                   [_Going._
25087,SCENE I,
25088,SCENE I,_Laska._            Stop! stop! one question only--
25089,SCENE I,I am quite calm--
25090,SCENE I,
25091,SCENE I,"_Glycine._        Ay, as the old song says,"
25092,SCENE I,"Calm as a tiger, valiant as a dove.                                200"
25093,SCENE I,"Nay now, I have marred the verse: well! this one question--"
25094,SCENE I,
25095,SCENE I,_Laska._ Are you not bound to me by your own promise?
25096,SCENE I,And is it not as plain--
25097,SCENE I,
25098,SCENE I,_Glycine._               Halt! that's two questions.
25099,SCENE I,
25100,SCENE I,"_Laska._ Pshaw! Is it not as plain as impudence,"
25101,SCENE I,"That you're in love with this young swaggering beggar,             205"
25102,SCENE I,"Bethlen Bathory? When he was accused,"
25103,SCENE I,Why pressed you forward? Why did you defend him?
25104,SCENE I,
25105,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Question meet question: that's a woman's privilege,"
25106,SCENE I,"Why, Laska, did you urge Lord Casimir"
25107,SCENE I,To make my lady force that promise from me?                        210
25108,SCENE I,
25109,SCENE I,"_Laska._ So then, you say, Lady Sarolta, forced you?"
25110,SCENE I,
25111,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Could I look up to her dear countenance,"
25112,SCENE I,And say her nay? As far back as I wot of
25113,SCENE I,"All her commands were gracious, sweet requests."
25114,SCENE I,"How could it be then, but that her requests                        215"
25115,SCENE I,Must needs have sounded to me as commands?
25116,SCENE I,"And as for love, had I a score of loves,"
25117,SCENE I,"I'd keep them all for my dear, kind, good mistress."
25118,SCENE I,
25119,SCENE I,_Laska._ Not one for Bethlen?
25120,SCENE I,
25121,SCENE I,_Glycine._                    Oh! that's a different thing.
25122,SCENE I,"To be sure he's brave, and handsome, and so pious                  220"
25123,SCENE I,To his good old father. But for loving him--
25124,SCENE I,"Nay, there, indeed you are mistaken, Laska!"
25125,SCENE I,Poor youth! I rather think I grieve for him;
25126,SCENE I,For I sigh so deeply when I think of him!
25127,SCENE I,"And if I see him, the tears come in my eyes,                       225"
25128,SCENE I,And my heart beats; and all because I dreamt
25129,SCENE I,That the war-wolf[908:1] had gored him as he hunted
25130,SCENE I,In the haunted forest!
25131,SCENE I,
25132,SCENE I,_Laska._               You dare own all this?
25133,SCENE I,Your lady will not warrant promise-breach.
25134,SCENE I,"Mine, pampered Miss! you shall be; and I'll make you               230"
25135,SCENE I,"Grieve for him with a vengeance. Odd's, my fingers"
25136,SCENE I,Tingle already!                     [_Makes threatening signs._
25137,SCENE I,
25138,SCENE I,_Glycine (aside)._ Ha! Bethlen coming this way!
25139,SCENE I,
25140,SCENE I,[_GLYCINE then cries out._
25141,SCENE I,
25142,SCENE I,"Oh, save me! save me! Pray don't kill me, Laska!"
25143,SCENE I,
25144,SCENE I,_Enter BETHLEN in a Hunting Dress._
25145,SCENE I,
25146,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ What, beat a woman!"
25147,SCENE I,
25148,SCENE I,_Laska (to Glycine)._          O you cockatrice!
25149,SCENE I,
25150,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ Unmanly dastard, hold!"
25151,SCENE I,
25152,SCENE I,_Laska._                          Do you chance to know            235
25153,SCENE I,"Who--I--am, Sir?--('Sdeath! how black he looks!)"
25154,SCENE I,
25155,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ I have started many strange beasts in my time,"
25156,SCENE I,"But none less like a man, than this before me"
25157,SCENE I,That lifts his hand against a timid female.
25158,SCENE I,
25159,SCENE I,_Laska._ Bold youth! she's mine.
25160,SCENE I,
25161,SCENE I,"_Glycine._                       No, not my master yet,            240"
25162,SCENE I,"But only is to be; and all, because"
25163,SCENE I,"Two years ago my lady asked me, and"
25164,SCENE I,"I promised her, not him; and if she'll let me,"
25165,SCENE I,"I'll hate you, my lord's steward."
25166,SCENE I,
25167,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._                        Hush, Glycine!"
25168,SCENE I,
25169,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Yes, I do, Bethlen; for he just now brought             245"
25170,SCENE I,False witnesses to swear away your life:
25171,SCENE I,"Your life, and old Bathory's too."
25172,SCENE I,
25173,SCENE I,_Bethlen._                        Bathory's!
25174,SCENE I,"Where is my father? Answer, or----Ha! gone!"
25175,SCENE I,
25176,SCENE I,[_LASKA during this time retires from the Stage._
25177,SCENE I,
25178,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Oh, heed not him! I saw you pressing onward,"
25179,SCENE I,"And did but feign alarm. Dear gallant youth,                       250"
25180,SCENE I,It is your life they seek!
25181,SCENE I,
25182,SCENE I,_Bethlen._                 My life?
25183,SCENE I,
25184,SCENE I,"_Glycine._                          Alas,"
25185,SCENE I,Lady Sarolta even--
25186,SCENE I,
25187,SCENE I,_Bethlen._          She does not know me!
25188,SCENE I,
25189,SCENE I,_Glycine._ Oh that she did! she could not then have spoken
25190,SCENE I,"With such stern countenance. But though she spurn me,"
25191,SCENE I,"I will kneel, Bethlen--"
25192,SCENE I,
25193,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._              Not for me, Glycine!                       255"
25194,SCENE I,What have I done? or whom have I offended?
25195,SCENE I,
25196,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Rash words, 'tis said, and treasonous of the king."
25197,SCENE I,
25198,SCENE I,[_BETHLEN mutters to himself._
25199,SCENE I,
25200,SCENE I,"_Glycine (aside)._ So looks the statue, in our hall, o' the god,"
25201,SCENE I,The shaft just flown that killed the serpent!
25202,SCENE I,
25203,SCENE I,_Bethlen._                                    King!
25204,SCENE I,
25205,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Ah, often have I wished you were a king.                260"
25206,SCENE I,"You would protect the helpless every where,"
25207,SCENE I,"As you did us. And I, too, should not then"
25208,SCENE I,"Grieve for you, Bethlen, as I do; nor have"
25209,SCENE I,The tears come in my eyes; nor dream bad dreams
25210,SCENE I,That you were killed in the forest; and then Laska                 265
25211,SCENE I,"Would have no right to rail at me, nor say"
25212,SCENE I,"(Yes, the base man, he says,) that I--I love you."
25213,SCENE I,
25214,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ Pretty Glycine! wert thou not betrothed--
25215,SCENE I,But in good truth I know not what I speak.
25216,SCENE I,This luckless morning I have been so haunted                       270
25217,SCENE I,"With my own fancies, starting up like omens,"
25218,SCENE I,"That I feel like one, who waking from a dream"
25219,SCENE I,Both asks and answers wildly.--But Bathory?
25220,SCENE I,
25221,SCENE I,_Glycine._ Hist! 'tis my lady's step! She must not see you!
25222,SCENE I,
25223,SCENE I,[_BETHLEN retires._
25224,SCENE I,
25225,SCENE I,_Enter from the Cottage SAROLTA and BATHORY._
25226,SCENE I,
25227,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ Go, seek your son! I need not add, be speedy--          275"
25228,SCENE I,"You here, Glycine?                             [_Exit BATHORY._"
25229,SCENE I,
25230,SCENE I,"_Glycine._         Pardon, pardon, Madam!"
25231,SCENE I,"If you but saw the old man's son, you would not,"
25232,SCENE I,You could not have him harmed.
25233,SCENE I,
25234,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                     Be calm, Glycine!"
25235,SCENE I,
25236,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ No, I shall break my heart."
25237,SCENE I,
25238,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                             Ha! is it so?
25239,SCENE I,"O strange and hidden power of sympathy,                            280"
25240,SCENE I,"That of--like fates, though all unknown to each,"
25241,SCENE I,"Dost make blind instincts, orphan's heart to orphan's"
25242,SCENE I,Drawing by dim disquiet!
25243,SCENE I,
25244,SCENE I,_Glycine._               Old Bathory--
25245,SCENE I,
25246,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ Seeks his brave son. Come, wipe away thy tears."
25247,SCENE I,"Yes, in good truth, Glycine, this same Bethlen                     285"
25248,SCENE I,Seems a most noble and deserving youth.
25249,SCENE I,
25250,SCENE I,_Glycine._ My lady does not mock me?
25251,SCENE I,
25252,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                           Where is Laska?
25253,SCENE I,Has he not told thee?
25254,SCENE I,
25255,SCENE I,_Glycine._            Nothing. In his fear--
25256,SCENE I,"Anger, I mean--stole off--I am so fluttered--"
25257,SCENE I,Left me abruptly--
25258,SCENE I,
25259,SCENE I,_Sarolta._         His shame excuses him!                          290
25260,SCENE I,He is somewhat hardly tasked; and in discharging
25261,SCENE I,"His own tools, cons a lesson for himself."
25262,SCENE I,Bathory and the youth henceforward live
25263,SCENE I,Safe in my lord's protection.
25264,SCENE I,
25265,SCENE I,_Glycine._                    The saints bless you!
25266,SCENE I,"Shame on my graceless heart! How dared I fear,                     295"
25267,SCENE I,Lady Sarolta could be cruel?
25268,SCENE I,
25269,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                   Come,"
25270,SCENE I,"Be yourself, girl!"
25271,SCENE I,
25272,SCENE I,"_Glycine._         O, 'tis so full here!"
25273,SCENE I,"And now it can not harm him if I tell you,"
25274,SCENE I,That the old man's son--
25275,SCENE I,
25276,SCENE I,_Sarolta._               Is not that old man's son!
25277,SCENE I,"A destiny, not unlike thine own, is his.                           300"
25278,SCENE I,"For all I know of thee is, that thou art"
25279,SCENE I,A soldier's orphan: left when rage intestine[911:1]
25280,SCENE I,Shook and engulphed the pillars of Illyria.
25281,SCENE I,"This other fragment, thrown back by that same earthquake,"
25282,SCENE I,"This, so mysteriously inscribed by nature,                         305"
25283,SCENE I,Perchance may piece out and interpret thine.
25284,SCENE I,Command thyself! Be secret! His true father----
25285,SCENE I,Hear'st thou?
25286,SCENE I,
25287,SCENE I,_Glycine._    O tell--
25288,SCENE I,
25289,SCENE I,"_Bethlen (rushing out)._ Yes, tell me, Shape from heaven!"
25290,SCENE I,Who is my father?
25291,SCENE I,
25292,SCENE I,_Sarolta (gazing with surprise)._ Thine? Thy father? Rise!
25293,SCENE I,
25294,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Alas! He hath alarmed you, my dear lady!                310"
25295,SCENE I,
25296,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ His countenance, not his act!"
25297,SCENE I,
25298,SCENE I,"_Glycine._                               Rise, Bethlen! Rise!"
25299,SCENE I,
25300,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ No; kneel thou too! and with thy orphan's tongue
25301,SCENE I,Plead for me! I am rooted to the earth
25302,SCENE I,And have no power to rise! Give me a father!
25303,SCENE I,There is a prayer in those uplifted eyes                           315
25304,SCENE I,"That seeks high Heaven! But I will overtake it,"
25305,SCENE I,"And bring it back, and make it plead for me"
25306,SCENE I,In thine own heart! Speak! Speak! Restore to me
25307,SCENE I,A name in the world!
25308,SCENE I,
25309,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._           By that blest Heaven I gazed at,"
25310,SCENE I,"I know not who thou art. And if I knew,                            320"
25311,SCENE I,Dared I--But rise!
25312,SCENE I,
25313,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._         Blest spirits of my parents,"
25314,SCENE I,Ye hover o'er me now! Ye shine upon me!
25315,SCENE I,"And like a flower that coils forth from a ruin,"
25316,SCENE I,I feel and seek the light I can not see!
25317,SCENE I,
25318,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ Thou see'st yon dim spot on the mountain's ridge,       325"
25319,SCENE I,But what it is thou know'st not. Even such
25320,SCENE I,"Is all I know of thee--haply, brave youth,"
25321,SCENE I,Is all Fate makes it safe for thee to know!
25322,SCENE I,
25323,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ Safe? Safe? O let me then inherit danger,"
25324,SCENE I,And it shall be my birth-right!
25325,SCENE I,
25326,SCENE I,_Sarolta (aside)._              That look again!--                 330
25327,SCENE I,"The wood which first incloses, and then skirts"
25328,SCENE I,The highest track that leads across the mountains--
25329,SCENE I,"Thou know'st it, Bethlen?"
25330,SCENE I,
25331,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._                Lady, 'twas my wont"
25332,SCENE I,To roam there in my childhood oft alone
25333,SCENE I,And mutter to myself the name of father.                           335
25334,SCENE I,"For still Bathory (why, till now I guessed not)"
25335,SCENE I,"Would never hear it from my lips, but sighing"
25336,SCENE I,Gazed upward. Yet of late an idle terror----
25337,SCENE I,
25338,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Madam, that wood is haunted by the war-wolves,"
25339,SCENE I,"Vampires, and monstrous----"
25340,SCENE I,
25341,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                  Moon-calves, credulous girl!           340"
25342,SCENE I,Haply some o'ergrown savage of the forest
25343,SCENE I,"Hath his lair there, and fear hath framed the rest."
25344,SCENE I,"After that last great battle, (O young man!"
25345,SCENE I,Thou wakest anew my life's sole anguish) that
25346,SCENE I,"Which fixed Lord Emerick on his throne, Bathory                    345"
25347,SCENE I,"Led by a cry, far inward from the track,"
25348,SCENE I,"In the hollow of an oak, as in a nest,"
25349,SCENE I,"Did find thee, Bethlen, then a helpless babe."
25350,SCENE I,The robe that wrapt thee was a widow's mantle.
25351,SCENE I,
25352,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ An infant's weakness doth relax my frame.               350
25353,SCENE I,O say--I fear to ask----
25354,SCENE I,
25355,SCENE I,_Sarolta._               And I to tell thee.
25356,SCENE I,
25357,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ Strike! O strike quickly! See, I do not shrink."
25358,SCENE I,"I am stone, cold stone."
25359,SCENE I,
25360,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._              Hid in a brake hard by,"
25361,SCENE I,"Scarce by both palms supported from the earth,"
25362,SCENE I,"A wounded lady lay, whose life fast waning                         355"
25363,SCENE I,"Seemed to survive itself in her fixt eyes,"
25364,SCENE I,That strained towards the babe. At length one arm
25365,SCENE I,"Painfully from her own weight disengaging,"
25366,SCENE I,"She pointed first to heaven, then from her bosom"
25367,SCENE I,Drew forth a golden casket. Thus entreated                         360
25368,SCENE I,"Thy foster-father took thee in his arms,"
25369,SCENE I,And kneeling spake: 'If aught of this world's comfort
25370,SCENE I,"Can reach thy heart, receive a poor man's troth,"
25371,SCENE I,That at my life's risk I will save thy child!'
25372,SCENE I,"Her countenance worked, as one that seemed preparing               365"
25373,SCENE I,"A loud voice, but it died upon her lips"
25374,SCENE I,"In a faint whisper, 'Fly! Save him! Hide--hide all!'"
25375,SCENE I,
25376,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ And did he leave her? What! had I a mother?
25377,SCENE I,"And left her bleeding, dying? Bought I vile life"
25378,SCENE I,With the desertion of a dying mother?                              370
25379,SCENE I,Oh agony!
25380,SCENE I,
25381,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ Alas! thou art bewildered,"
25382,SCENE I,And dost forget thou wert a helpless infant!
25383,SCENE I,
25384,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ What else can I remember, but a mother"
25385,SCENE I,Mangled and left to perish?
25386,SCENE I,
25387,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                  Hush, Glycine!"
25388,SCENE I,It is the ground-swell of a teeming instinct:                      375
25389,SCENE I,"Let it but lift itself to air and sunshine,"
25390,SCENE I,And it will find a mirror in the waters
25391,SCENE I,It now makes boil above it. Check him not!
25392,SCENE I,
25393,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ O that I were diffused among the waters
25394,SCENE I,"That pierce into the secret depths of earth,                       380"
25395,SCENE I,And find their way in darkness! Would that I
25396,SCENE I,Could spread myself upon the homeless winds!
25397,SCENE I,And I would seek her! for she is not dead!
25398,SCENE I,"She can not die! O pardon, gracious lady!"
25399,SCENE I,"You were about to say, that he returned--                          385"
25400,SCENE I,
25401,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ Deep Love, the godlike in us, still believes"
25402,SCENE I,Its objects as immortal as itself!
25403,SCENE I,
25404,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ And found her still--
25405,SCENE I,
25406,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                       Alas! he did return,"
25407,SCENE I,"He left no spot unsearched in all the forest,"
25408,SCENE I,But she (I trust me by some friendly hand)                         390
25409,SCENE I,Had been borne off.
25410,SCENE I,
25411,SCENE I,_Bethlen._          O whither?
25412,SCENE I,
25413,SCENE I,_Glycine._                     Dearest Bethlen!
25414,SCENE I,I would that you could weep like me! O do not
25415,SCENE I,Gaze so upon the air!
25416,SCENE I,
25417,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._            While he was absent,"
25418,SCENE I,"A friendly troop, 'tis certain, scoured the wood,"
25419,SCENE I,Hotly pursued indeed by Emerick.
25420,SCENE I,
25421,SCENE I,_Bethlen._                       Emerick.                          395
25422,SCENE I,Oh hell!
25423,SCENE I,
25424,SCENE I,_Glycine._ Bethlen!
25425,SCENE I,
25426,SCENE I,_Bethlen._          Hist! I'll curse him in a whisper!
25427,SCENE I,This gracious lady must hear blessings only.
25428,SCENE I,"She hath not yet the glory round her head,"
25429,SCENE I,"Nor those strong eagle wings, which make swift way"
25430,SCENE I,"To that appointed place, which I must seek;                        400"
25431,SCENE I,Or else she were my mother!
25432,SCENE I,
25433,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                  Noble youth!
25434,SCENE I,From me fear nothing! Long time have I owed
25435,SCENE I,Offerings of expiation for misdeeds
25436,SCENE I,"Long past that weigh me down, though innocent!"
25437,SCENE I,"Thy foster-father hid the secret from thee,                        405"
25438,SCENE I,"For he perceived thy thoughts as they expanded,"
25439,SCENE I,"Proud, restless, and ill-sorting with thy state!"
25440,SCENE I,Vain was his care! Thou'st made thyself suspected
25441,SCENE I,"E'en where suspicion reigns, and asks no proof"
25442,SCENE I,But its own fears! Great Nature hath endowed thee                  410
25443,SCENE I,With her best gifts! From me thou shalt receive
25444,SCENE I,All honourable aidance! But haste hence!
25445,SCENE I,"Travel will ripen thee, and enterprise"
25446,SCENE I,Beseems thy years! Be thou henceforth my soldier!
25447,SCENE I,"And whatsoe'er betide thee, still believe                          415"
25448,SCENE I,"That in each noble deed, achieved or suffered,"
25449,SCENE I,Thou solvest best the riddle of thy birth!
25450,SCENE I,And may the light that streams from thine own honour
25451,SCENE I,Guide thee to that thou seekest!
25452,SCENE I,
25453,SCENE I,_Glycine._                       Must he leave us?
25454,SCENE I,
25455,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ And for such goodness can I return nothing              420
25456,SCENE I,But some hot tears that sting mine eyes? Some sighs
25457,SCENE I,That if not breathed would swell my heart to stifling?
25458,SCENE I,"May heaven and thine own virtues, high-born lady,"
25459,SCENE I,"Be as a shield of fire, far, far aloof"
25460,SCENE I,"To scare all evil from thee! Yet, if fate                          425"
25461,SCENE I,"Hath destined thee one doubtful hour of danger,"
25462,SCENE I,"From the uttermost region of the earth, methinks,"
25463,SCENE I,"Swift as a spirit invoked, I should be with thee!"
25464,SCENE I,"And then, perchance, I might have power to unbosom"
25465,SCENE I,These thanks that struggle here. Eyes fair as thine                430
25466,SCENE I,"Have gazed on me with tears of love and anguish,"
25467,SCENE I,"Which these eyes saw not, or beheld unconscious;"
25468,SCENE I,"And tones of anxious fondness, passionate prayers,"
25469,SCENE I,Have been talked to me! But this tongue ne'er soothed
25470,SCENE I,"A mother's ear, lisping a mother's name!                           435"
25471,SCENE I,"O, at how dear a price have I been loved"
25472,SCENE I,"And no love could return! One boon then, lady!"
25473,SCENE I,"Where'er thou bidd'st, I go thy faithful soldier,"
25474,SCENE I,"But first must trace the spot, where she lay bleeding"
25475,SCENE I,Who gave me life. No more shall beast of ravine                    440
25476,SCENE I,Affront with baser spoil that sacred forest!
25477,SCENE I,"Or if avengers more than human haunt there,"
25478,SCENE I,"Take they what shape they list, savage or heavenly,"
25479,SCENE I,"They shall make answer to me, though my heart's blood"
25480,SCENE I,Should be the spell to bind them. Blood calls for blood!           445
25481,SCENE I,
25482,SCENE I,[_Exit Bethlen._
25483,SCENE I,
25484,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ Ah! it was this I feared. To ward off this
25485,SCENE I,Did I withhold from him that old Bathory
25486,SCENE I,"Returning hid beneath the self-same oak,"
25487,SCENE I,"Where the babe lay, the mantle, and some jewel"
25488,SCENE I,Bound on his infant arm.
25489,SCENE I,
25490,SCENE I,"_Glycine._               Oh, let me fly                            450"
25491,SCENE I,And stop him! Mangled limbs do there lie scattered
25492,SCENE I,Till the lured eagle bears them to her nest.
25493,SCENE I,And voices have been heard! And there the plant grows
25494,SCENE I,That being eaten gives the inhuman wizard
25495,SCENE I,Power to put on the fell hy√¶na's shape.                            455
25496,SCENE I,
25497,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ What idle tongue hath bewitched thee, Glycine?"
25498,SCENE I,I hoped that thou had'st learnt a nobler faith.
25499,SCENE I,
25500,SCENE I,"_Glycine._ O chide me not, dear lady; question Laska,"
25501,SCENE I,Or the old man.
25502,SCENE I,
25503,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._      Forgive me, I spake harshly."
25504,SCENE I,It is indeed a mighty sorcery                                      460
25505,SCENE I,"That doth enthral thy young heart, my poor girl,"
25506,SCENE I,And what hath Laska told thee?
25507,SCENE I,
25508,SCENE I,_Glycine._                     Three days past
25509,SCENE I,A courier from the king did cross that wood;
25510,SCENE I,"A wilful man, that armed himself on purpose:"
25511,SCENE I,And never hath been heard of from that time!                       465
25512,SCENE I,
25513,SCENE I,[_Sound of horns without._
25514,SCENE I,
25515,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ Hark! dost thou hear it!
25516,SCENE I,
25517,SCENE I,_Glycine._                          'Tis the sound of horns!
25518,SCENE I,Our huntsmen are not out!
25519,SCENE I,
25520,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                Lord Casimir
25521,SCENE I,Would not come thus!                            [_Horns again._
25522,SCENE I,
25523,SCENE I,_Glycine._           Still louder!
25524,SCENE I,
25525,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                         Haste we hence!
25526,SCENE I,For I believe in part thy tale of terror!
25527,SCENE I,"But, trust me, 'tis the inner man transformed:                     470"
25528,SCENE I,Beasts in the shape of men are worse than war-wolves.
25529,SCENE I,
25530,SCENE I,"[_SAROLTA and GLYCINE exeunt. Trumpets, &c. louder. Enter"
25531,SCENE I,"EMERICK, LORD RUDOLPH, LASKA, and_ Huntsmen _and_"
25532,SCENE I,Attendants.
25533,SCENE I,
25534,SCENE I,"_Rudolph._ A gallant chase, sire."
25535,SCENE I,
25536,SCENE I,"_Emerick._                        Aye, but this new quarry"
25537,SCENE I,That we last started seems worth all the rest.
25538,SCENE I,
25539,SCENE I,[_then to Laska._
25540,SCENE I,
25541,SCENE I,And you--excuse me--what's your name?
25542,SCENE I,
25543,SCENE I,_Laska._                              Whatever
25544,SCENE I,Your majesty may please.
25545,SCENE I,
25546,SCENE I,"_Emerick._               Nay, that's too late, man.                475"
25547,SCENE I,"Say, what thy mother and thy godfather"
25548,SCENE I,Were pleased to call thee.
25549,SCENE I,
25550,SCENE I,"_Laska._                   Laska, my liege sovereign."
25551,SCENE I,
25552,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ Well, my liege subject, Laska! And you are"
25553,SCENE I,Lord Casimir's steward?
25554,SCENE I,
25555,SCENE I,_Laska._                And your majesty's creature.
25556,SCENE I,
25557,SCENE I,_Emerick._ Two gentle dames made off at our approach.              480
25558,SCENE I,Which was your lady?
25559,SCENE I,
25560,SCENE I,"_Laska_              My liege lord, the taller."
25561,SCENE I,"The other, please your grace, is her poor handmaid,"
25562,SCENE I,Long since betrothed to me. But the maid's froward--
25563,SCENE I,Yet would your grace but speak--
25564,SCENE I,
25565,SCENE I,"_Emerick._                       Hum, master steward!"
25566,SCENE I,I am honoured with this sudden confidence.                         485
25567,SCENE I,"Lead on.                          [_to Laska, then to Rudolph._"
25568,SCENE I,"Lord Rudolph, you'll announce our coming."
25569,SCENE I,"Greet fair Sarolta from me, and entreat her"
25570,SCENE I,"To be our gentle hostess. Mark, you add"
25571,SCENE I,"How much we grieve, that business of the state"
25572,SCENE I,Hath forced us to delay her lord's return.                         490
25573,SCENE I,
25574,SCENE I,"_Lord Rudolph (aside)._ Lewd, ingrate tyrant! Yes, I will announce"
25575,SCENE I,thee.
25576,SCENE I,
25577,SCENE I,_Emerick._ Now onward all.                [_Exeunt attendants._
25578,SCENE I,"A fair one, by my faith!"
25579,SCENE I,"If her face rival but her gait and stature,"
25580,SCENE I,My good friend Casimir had his reasons too.
25581,SCENE I,"'Her tender health, her vow of strict retirement,                  495"
25582,SCENE I,Made early in the convent--His word pledged--'
25583,SCENE I,"All fictions, all! fictions of jealousy."
25584,SCENE I,"Well! If the mountain move not to the prophet,"
25585,SCENE I,The prophet must to the mountain! In this Laska
25586,SCENE I,There's somewhat of the knave mixed up with dolt.                  500
25587,SCENE I,"Through the transparence of the fool, methought,"
25588,SCENE I,I saw (as I could lay my finger on it)
25589,SCENE I,"The crocodile's eye, that peered up from the bottom."
25590,SCENE I,This knave may do us service. Hot ambition
25591,SCENE I,Won me the husband. Now let vanity                                 505
25592,SCENE I,And the resentment for a forced seclusion
25593,SCENE I,Decoy the wife! Let him be deemed the aggressor
25594,SCENE I,Whose cunning and distrust began the game!             [_Exit._

25769,SCENE I,
25770,SCENE I,"_A savage wood. At one side a cavern, overhung with ivy. ZAPOLYA and"
25771,SCENE I,"RAAB KIUPRILI discovered: both, but especially the latter, in rude and"
25772,SCENE I,savage garments._
25773,SCENE I,
25774,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._ Heard you then aught while I was slumbering?
25775,SCENE I,
25776,SCENE I,_Zapolya._                                                    Nothing.
25777,SCENE I,Only your face became convulsed. We miserable!
25778,SCENE I,Is heaven's last mercy fled? Is sleep grown treacherous?
25779,SCENE I,
25780,SCENE I,"_Raab Kiuprili._ O for a sleep, for sleep itself to rest in!"
25781,SCENE I,"I dream'd I had met with food beneath a tree,                        5"
25782,SCENE I,"And I was seeking you, when all at once"
25783,SCENE I,My feet became entangled in a net:
25784,SCENE I,Still more entangled as in rage I tore it.
25785,SCENE I,"At length I freed myself, had sight of you,"
25786,SCENE I,"But as I hastened eagerly, again                                    10"
25787,SCENE I,I found my frame encumbered: a huge serpent
25788,SCENE I,"Twined round my chest, but tightest round my throat."
25789,SCENE I,
25790,SCENE I,_Zapolya._ Alas! 'twas lack of food: for hunger chokes!
25791,SCENE I,
25792,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._ And now I saw you by a shrivelled child
25793,SCENE I,"Strangely pursued. You did not fly, yet neither                     15"
25794,SCENE I,"Touched you the ground, methought, but close above it"
25795,SCENE I,"Did seem to shoot yourself along the air,"
25796,SCENE I,"And as you passed me, turned your face and shrieked."
25797,SCENE I,
25798,SCENE I,"_Zapolya._ I did in truth send forth a feeble shriek,"
25799,SCENE I,Scarce knowing why. Perhaps the mock'd sense craved                 20
25800,SCENE I,"To hear the scream, which you but seemed to utter."
25801,SCENE I,For your whole face looked like a mask of torture!
25802,SCENE I,Yet a child's image doth indeed pursue me
25803,SCENE I,Shrivelled with toil and penury!
25804,SCENE I,
25805,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._                 Nay! what ails you?
25806,SCENE I,
25807,SCENE I,_Zapolya._ A wondrous faintness there comes stealing o'er me.       25
25808,SCENE I,"Is it Death's lengthening shadow, who comes onward,"
25809,SCENE I,Life's setting sun behind him?
25810,SCENE I,
25811,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._               Cheerly! The dusk
25812,SCENE I,"Will quickly shroud us. Ere the moon be up,"
25813,SCENE I,Trust me I'll bring thee food!
25814,SCENE I,
25815,SCENE I,_Zapolya._                     Hunger's tooth has
25816,SCENE I,"Gnawn itself blunt. O, I could queen it well                        30"
25817,SCENE I,O'er my own sorrows as my rightful subjects.
25818,SCENE I,"But wherefore, O revered Kiuprili! wherefore"
25819,SCENE I,"Did my importunate prayers, my hopes and fancies,"
25820,SCENE I,Force thee from thy secure though sad retreat?
25821,SCENE I,Would that my tongue had then cloven to my mouth!                   35
25822,SCENE I,"But Heaven is just! With tears I conquered thee,"
25823,SCENE I,And not a tear is left me to repent with!
25824,SCENE I,Had'st thou not done already--had'st thou not
25825,SCENE I,"Suffered--oh, more than e'er man feigned of friendship?"
25826,SCENE I,
25827,SCENE I,_Raab Kiuprili._ Yet be thou comforted! What! had'st thou faith     40
25828,SCENE I,When I turned back incredulous? 'Twas thy light
25829,SCENE I,"That kindled mine. And shall it now go out,"
25830,SCENE I,"And leave thy soul in darkness? Yet look up,"
25831,SCENE I,And think thou see'st thy sainted lord commissioned
25832,SCENE I,"And on his way to aid us! Whence those late dreams,                 45"
25833,SCENE I,Which after such long interval of hopeless
25834,SCENE I,And silent resignation all at once
25835,SCENE I,Night after night commanded thy return
25836,SCENE I,Hither? and still presented in clear vision
25837,SCENE I,This wood as in a scene? this very cavern?                          50
25838,SCENE I,Thou darest not doubt that Heaven's especial hand
25839,SCENE I,Worked in those signs. The hour of thy deliverance
25840,SCENE I,Is on the stroke:--for misery can not add
25841,SCENE I,"Grief to thy griefs, or patience to thy sufferance!"
25842,SCENE I,
25843,SCENE I,"_Zapolya._ Can not! Oh, what if thou wert taken from me?            55"
25844,SCENE I,"Nay, thou said'st well: for that and death were one."
25845,SCENE I,Life's grief is at its height indeed; the hard
25846,SCENE I,Necessity of this inhuman state
25847,SCENE I,Hath made our deeds inhuman as our vestments.
25848,SCENE I,"Housed in this wild wood, with wild usages,                         60"
25849,SCENE I,"Danger our guest, and famine at our portal--"
25850,SCENE I,Wolf-like to prowl in the shepherd's fold by night!

26268,SCENE I,"_Emerick._                   'Tis your talk,"
26269,SCENE I,"Is it, good statesman Laska?"
26270,SCENE I,
26271,SCENE I,"_Laska._                     No, not mine,                          15"
26272,SCENE I,"Not mine, an please your Majesty! There are"
26273,SCENE I,Some insolent malcontents indeed that talk thus--
26274,SCENE I,"Nay worse, mere treason. As Bathory's son,"
26275,SCENE I,The fool that ran into the monster's jaws.
26276,SCENE I,
26277,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ Well, 'tis a loyal monster if he rids us                 20"
26278,SCENE I,Of traitors! But art sure the youth's devoured?
26279,SCENE I,
26280,SCENE I,"_Laska._ Not a limb left, an please your Majesty!"
26281,SCENE I,And that unhappy girl--
26282,SCENE I,
26283,SCENE I,_Emerick._              Thou followed'st her
26284,SCENE I,Into the wood?                            [_LASKA bows assent._
26285,SCENE I,Henceforth then I'll believe
26286,SCENE I,That jealousy can make a hare a lion.                               25
26287,SCENE I,
26288,SCENE I,"_Laska._ Scarce had I got the first glimpse of her veil,"
26289,SCENE I,"When, with a horrid roar that made the leaves"
26290,SCENE I,Of the wood shake--
26291,SCENE I,
26292,SCENE I,_Emerick._          Made thee shake like a leaf!
26293,SCENE I,
26294,SCENE I,_Laska._ The war-wolf leapt; at the first plunge he seized her;
26295,SCENE I,Forward I rushed!
26296,SCENE I,
26297,SCENE I,_Emerick._        Most marvellous!
26298,SCENE I,
26299,SCENE I,_Laska._                           Hurled my javelin;               30
26300,SCENE I,Which from his dragon-scales recoiling--
26301,SCENE I,
26302,SCENE I,_Emerick._                               Enough!
26303,SCENE I,"And take, friend, this advice. When next thou tonguest it,"
26304,SCENE I,"Hold constant to thy exploit with this monster,"
26305,SCENE I,"And leave untouched your common talk aforesaid,"
26306,SCENE I,"What your Lord did, or should have done."
26307,SCENE I,
26308,SCENE I,_Laska._                                 My talk?                   35
26309,SCENE I,"The saints forbid! I always said, for my part,"
26310,SCENE I,'Was not the king Lord Casimir's dearest friend?
26311,SCENE I,Was not that friend a king? Whate'er he did
26312,SCENE I,'Twas all from pure love to his Majesty.'
26313,SCENE I,
26314,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ And this then was thy talk? While knave and coward,      40"
26315,SCENE I,"Both strong within thee, wrestle for the uppermost,"
26316,SCENE I,In slips the fool and takes the place of both.
26317,SCENE I,"Babbler! Lord Casimir did, as thou and all men."
26318,SCENE I,"He loved himself, loved honours, wealth, dominion."
26319,SCENE I,All these were set upon a father's head:                            45
26320,SCENE I,Good truth! a most unlucky accident!
26321,SCENE I,For he but wished to hit the prize; not graze
26322,SCENE I,The head that bore it: so with steady eye
26323,SCENE I,Off flew the parricidal arrow.--Even
26324,SCENE I,"As Casimir loved Emerick, Emerick                                   50"
26325,SCENE I,"Loves Casimir, intends him no dishonour."
26326,SCENE I,"He winked not then, for love of me forsooth!"
26327,SCENE I,For love of me now let him wink! Or if
26328,SCENE I,"The dame prove half as wise as she is fair,"
26329,SCENE I,"He may still pass his hand, and find all smooth.                    55"
26330,SCENE I,
26331,SCENE I,[_Passing his hand across his brow._
26332,SCENE I,
26333,SCENE I,_Laska._ Your Majesty's reasoning has convinced me.
26334,SCENE I,
26335,SCENE I,_Emerick._                                          Thee!
26336,SCENE I,'Tis well! and more than meant. For by my faith
26337,SCENE I,I had half forgotten thee.--Thou hast the key?   [_LASKA bows._
26338,SCENE I,And in your lady's chamber there's full space?
26339,SCENE I,
26340,SCENE I,_Laska._ Between the wall and arras to conceal you.                 60
26341,SCENE I,
26342,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ Here! This purse is but an earnest of thy fortune,"
26343,SCENE I,"If thou prov'st faithful. But if thou betrayest me,"
26344,SCENE I,Hark you!--the wolf that shall drag thee to his den
26345,SCENE I,Shall be no fiction.
26346,SCENE I,
26347,SCENE I,"[_Exit EMERICK. LASKA manet with a key in one hand, and a"
26348,SCENE I,purse in the other._
26349,SCENE I,
26350,SCENE I,"_Laska._             Well then! here I stand,"
26351,SCENE I,"Like Hercules, on either side a goddess.                            65"
26352,SCENE I,Call this (_looking at the purse_)
26353,SCENE I,Preferment; this (_holding up the key_) Fidelity!
26354,SCENE I,And first my golden goddess: what bids she?
26355,SCENE I,"Only:--'This way, your Majesty! hush! The household"
26356,SCENE I,"Are all safe lodged.'--Then, put Fidelity"
26357,SCENE I,"Within her proper wards, just turn her round--                      70"
26358,SCENE I,"So--the door opens--and for all the rest,"
26359,SCENE I,"'Tis the king's deed, not Laska's. Do but this"
26360,SCENE I,And--'I'm the mere earnest of your future fortunes.'
26361,SCENE I,But what says the other?--Whisper on! I hear you!
26362,SCENE I,
26363,SCENE I,[_Putting the key to his ear._
26364,SCENE I,
26365,SCENE I,"All very true!--but, good Fidelity!                                 75"
26366,SCENE I,"If I refuse King Emerick, will you promise,"
26367,SCENE I,"And swear now, to unlock the dungeon door,"
26368,SCENE I,And save me from the hangman? Aye! you're silent!
26369,SCENE I,"What, not a word in answer? A clear nonsuit!"
26370,SCENE I,Now for one look to see that all are lodged                         80
26371,SCENE I,At the due distance--then--yonder lies the road
26372,SCENE I,"For Laska and his royal friend, King Emerick!"
26373,SCENE I,
26374,SCENE I,[_Exit LASKA. Then enter BATHORY and BETHLEN._
26375,SCENE I,
26376,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ He looked as if he were some God disguised
26377,SCENE I,In an old warrior's venerable shape
26378,SCENE I,To guard and guide my mother. Is there not                          85
26379,SCENE I,Chapel or oratory in this mansion?
26380,SCENE I,
26381,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._ Even so.
26382,SCENE I,
26383,SCENE I,_Bethlen._              From that place then am I to take
26384,SCENE I,"A helm and breast-plate, both inlaid with gold,"
26385,SCENE I,And the good sword that once was Raab Kiuprili's.
26386,SCENE I,
26387,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._ Those very arms this day Sarolta show'd me--         90
26388,SCENE I,With wistful look. I'm lost in wild conjectures!
26389,SCENE I,
26390,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ O tempt me not, e'en with a wandering guess,"
26391,SCENE I,To break the first command a mother's will
26392,SCENE I,"Imposed, a mother's voice made known to me!"
26393,SCENE I,"'Ask not, my son,' said she, 'our names or thine.                   95"
26394,SCENE I,The shadow of the eclipse is passing off
26395,SCENE I,The full orb of thy destiny! Already
26396,SCENE I,The victor Crescent glitters forth and sheds
26397,SCENE I,O'er the yet lingering haze a phantom light.
26398,SCENE I,Thou canst not hasten it! Leave then to Heaven                     100
26399,SCENE I,The work of Heaven: and with a silent spirit
26400,SCENE I,Sympathize with the powers that work in silence!'
26401,SCENE I,"Thus spake she, and she looked as she were then"
26402,SCENE I,Fresh from some heavenly vision!
26403,SCENE I,
26404,SCENE I,"[_Re-enter LASKA, not perceiving them._"
26405,SCENE I,
26406,SCENE I,_Laska._                         All asleep!
26407,SCENE I,
26408,SCENE I,"[_Then observing BETHLEN, stands in idiot-affright._"
26409,SCENE I,
26410,SCENE I,I must speak to it first--Put--put the question!                   105
26411,SCENE I,I'll confess all!                      [_Stammering with fear._
26412,SCENE I,
26413,SCENE I,"_Old Bathory._ Laska! what ails thee, man?"
26414,SCENE I,
26415,SCENE I,_Laska (pointing to Bethlen)._ There!
26416,SCENE I,
26417,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._                        I see nothing! where?
26418,SCENE I,
26419,SCENE I,_Laska._                                                    He does
26420,SCENE I,not see it!
26421,SCENE I,"Bethlen, torment me not!"
26422,SCENE I,
26423,SCENE I,_Bethlen._               Soft! Rouse him gently!
26424,SCENE I,"He hath outwatched his hour, and half asleep,"
26425,SCENE I,"With eyes half open, mingles sight with dreams.                    110"
26426,SCENE I,
26427,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._ Ho! Laska! Don't you know us! 'tis Bathory
26428,SCENE I,And Bethlen!
26429,SCENE I,
26430,SCENE I,_Laska._     Good now! Ha! ha! An excellent trick.
26431,SCENE I,"Afraid? Nay, no offence! But I must laugh."
26432,SCENE I,"But are you sure now, that 'tis you, yourself?"
26433,SCENE I,
26434,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ Would'st be convinced?
26435,SCENE I,
26436,SCENE I,"_Laska._                          No nearer, pray! consider!       115"
26437,SCENE I,"If it should prove his ghost, the touch would freeze me"
26438,SCENE I,To a tombstone. No nearer!
26439,SCENE I,
26440,SCENE I,_Bethlen._                 The fool is drunk!
26441,SCENE I,
26442,SCENE I,_Laska._ Well now! I love a brave man to my heart.
26443,SCENE I,"I myself braved the monster, and would fain"
26444,SCENE I,Have saved the false one from the fate she tempted.                120
26445,SCENE I,
26446,SCENE I,"_Old Bathory._ You, Laska?"
26447,SCENE I,
26448,SCENE I,_Bethlen (to Bathory)._    Mark! Heaven grant it may be so!
26449,SCENE I,Glycine?
26450,SCENE I,
26451,SCENE I,_Laska._ She! I traced her by the voice.
26452,SCENE I,"You'll scarce believe me, when I say I heard"
26453,SCENE I,The close of a song: the poor wretch had been singing:
26454,SCENE I,As if she wished to compliment the war-wolf                        125
26455,SCENE I,At once with music and a meal!
26456,SCENE I,
26457,SCENE I,_Bethlen (to Bathory)._        Mark that!
26458,SCENE I,
26459,SCENE I,"_Laska._ At the next moment I beheld her running,"
26460,SCENE I,"Wringing her hands with, 'Bethlen! O poor Bethlen!'"
26461,SCENE I,"I almost fear, the sudden noise I made,"
26462,SCENE I,"Rushing impetuous through the brake, alarmed her.                  130"
26463,SCENE I,"She stopt, then mad with fear, turned round and ran"
26464,SCENE I,Into the monster's gripe. One piteous scream
26465,SCENE I,I heard. There was no second--I--
26466,SCENE I,
26467,SCENE I,_Bethlen._                        Stop there!
26468,SCENE I,We'll spare your modesty! Who dares not honour
26469,SCENE I,"Laska's brave tongue, and high heroic fancy?                       135"
26470,SCENE I,
26471,SCENE I,"_Laska._ You too, Sir Knight, have come back safe and sound!"
26472,SCENE I,You played the hero at a cautious distance!
26473,SCENE I,Or was it that you sent the poor girl forward
26474,SCENE I,To stay the monster's stomach? Dainties quickly
26475,SCENE I,Pall on the taste and cloy the appetite!                           140
26476,SCENE I,
26477,SCENE I,"_Old Bathory._ Laska, beware! Forget not what thou art!"
26478,SCENE I,"Should'st thou but dream thou'rt valiant, cross thyself!"
26479,SCENE I,And ache all over at the dangerous fancy!
26480,SCENE I,
26481,SCENE I,"_Laska._ What then! you swell upon my lady's favour,"
26482,SCENE I,High Lords and perilous of one day's growth!                       145
26483,SCENE I,But other judges now sit on the bench!
26484,SCENE I,"And haply, Laska hath found audience there,"
26485,SCENE I,Where to defend the treason of a son
26486,SCENE I,Might end in lifting up both son and father
26487,SCENE I,Still higher; to a height from which indeed                        150
26488,SCENE I,"You both may drop, but, spite of fate and fortune,"
26489,SCENE I,Will be secured from falling to the ground.
26490,SCENE I,"'Tis possible too, young man! that royal Emerick,"
26491,SCENE I,"At Laska's rightful suit, may make inquiry"
26492,SCENE I,"By whom seduced, the maid so strangely missing--                   155"
26493,SCENE I,
26494,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ Soft! my good Laska! might it not suffice,"
26495,SCENE I,"If to yourself, being Lord Casimir's steward,"
26496,SCENE I,I should make record of Glycine's fate?
26497,SCENE I,
26498,SCENE I,_Laska._ 'Tis well! it shall content me! though your fear
26499,SCENE I,Has all the credit of these lowered tones.                         160
26500,SCENE I,First we demand the manner of her death?
26501,SCENE I,
26502,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ Nay! that's superfluous! Have you not just told us,"
26503,SCENE I,"That you yourself, led by impetuous valour,"
26504,SCENE I,Witnessed the whole? My tale's of later date.
26505,SCENE I,"After the fate, from which your valour strove                      165"
26506,SCENE I,"In vain to rescue the rash maid, I saw her!"
26507,SCENE I,
26508,SCENE I,_Laska._ Glycine?
26509,SCENE I,
26510,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._        Nay! Dare I accuse wise Laska,"
26511,SCENE I,"Whose words find access to a monarch's ear,"
26512,SCENE I,"Of a base, braggart lie? It must have been"
26513,SCENE I,Her spirit that appeared to me. But haply                          170
26514,SCENE I,I come too late? It has itself delivered
26515,SCENE I,Its own commission to you?
26516,SCENE I,
26517,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._             'Tis most likely!
26518,SCENE I,"And the ghost doubtless vanished, when we entered"
26519,SCENE I,And found brave Laska staring wide--at nothing!
26520,SCENE I,
26521,SCENE I,"_Laska._ 'Tis well! You've ready wits! I shall report them,        175"
26522,SCENE I,"With all due honour, to his Majesty!"
26523,SCENE I,"Treasure them up, I pray! A certain person,"
26524,SCENE I,"Whom the king flatters with his confidence,"
26525,SCENE I,"Tells you, his royal friend asks startling questions!"
26526,SCENE I,'Tis but a hint! And now what says the ghost!                      180
26527,SCENE I,
26528,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ Listen! for thus it spake: 'Say thou to Laska,"
26529,SCENE I,"Glycine, knowing all thy thoughts engrossed"
26530,SCENE I,"In thy new office of king's fool and knave,"
26531,SCENE I,Foreseeing thou'lt forget with thine own hand
26532,SCENE I,"To make due penance for the wrongs thou'st caused her,             185"
26533,SCENE I,"For thy soul's safety, doth consent to take it"
26534,SCENE I,From Bethlen's cudgel'--thus.                 [_Beats him off._
26535,SCENE I,Off! scoundrel! off!
26536,SCENE I,
26537,SCENE I,[_LASKA runs away._
26538,SCENE I,
26539,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._ The sudden swelling of this shallow dastard
26540,SCENE I,Tells of a recent storm: the first disruption
26541,SCENE I,Of the black cloud that hangs and threatens o'er us.               190
26542,SCENE I,
26543,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ E'en this reproves my loitering. Say where lies
26544,SCENE I,The oratory?
26545,SCENE I,
26546,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._ Ascend yon flight of stairs!
26547,SCENE I,Midway the corridor a silver lamp
26548,SCENE I,"Hangs o'er the entrance of Sarolta's chamber,"
26549,SCENE I,"And facing it, the low arched oratory!                             195"
26550,SCENE I,Me thou'lt find watching at the outward gate:
26551,SCENE I,"For a petard might burst the bars, unheard"
26552,SCENE I,"By the drenched porter, and Sarolta hourly"
26553,SCENE I,"Expects Lord Casimir, spite of Emerick's message!"
26554,SCENE I,
26555,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ There I will meet you! And till then good-night!        200
26556,SCENE I,"Dear good old man, good-night!"
26557,SCENE I,
26558,SCENE I,_Old Bathory._                 O yet one moment!
26559,SCENE I,"What I repelled, when it did seem my own,"
26560,SCENE I,"I cling to, now 'tis parting--call me father!"
26561,SCENE I,"It can not now mislead thee. O my son,"
26562,SCENE I,"Ere yet our tongues have learnt another name,                      205"
26563,SCENE I,Bethlen!--say 'Father' to me!
26564,SCENE I,
26565,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._                    Now, and for ever"
26566,SCENE I,"My father! other sire than thou, on earth"
26567,SCENE I,"I never had, a dearer could not have!"
26568,SCENE I,"From the base earth you raised me to your arms,"
26569,SCENE I,"And I would leap from off a throne, and kneeling,                  210"
26570,SCENE I,Ask Heaven's blessing from thy lips. My father!
26571,SCENE I,
26572,SCENE I,_Bathory._ Go! Go!                             [_Exit BETHLEN._
26573,SCENE I,"May every star now shining over us,"
26574,SCENE I,"Be as an angel's eye, to watch and guard him!  [_Exit BATHORY._"
26575,SCENE I,
26576,SCENE I,
26577,SCENE I,"_Scene changes to a splendid Bed-chamber, hung with tapestry._"
26578,SCENE I,
26579,SCENE I,_SAROLTA and an_ Attendant.
26580,SCENE I,
26581,SCENE I,"_Attendant._ We all did love her, madam!"
26582,SCENE I,
26583,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                               She deserved it!
26584,SCENE I,"Luckless Glycine! rash, unhappy girl!                              215"
26585,SCENE I,'Twas the first time she e'er deceived me.
26586,SCENE I,
26587,SCENE I,"_Attendant._ She was in love, and had she not died thus,"
26588,SCENE I,"With grief for Bethlen's loss, and fear of Laska,"
26589,SCENE I,She would have pined herself to death at home.
26590,SCENE I,
26591,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ Has the youth's father come back from his search?       220
26592,SCENE I,
26593,SCENE I,"_Attendant._ He never will, I fear me. O dear lady!"
26594,SCENE I,That Laska did so triumph o'er the old man--
26595,SCENE I,"It was quite cruel--'You'll be sure,' said he,"
26596,SCENE I,"'To meet with part at least of your son Bethlen,"
26597,SCENE I,Or the war-wolf must have a quick digestion!                       225
26598,SCENE I,Go! Search the wood by all means! Go! I pray you!'
26599,SCENE I,
26600,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ Inhuman wretch!
26601,SCENE I,
26602,SCENE I,_Attendant._               And old Bathory answered
26603,SCENE I,"With a sad smile, 'It is a witch's prayer,"
26604,SCENE I,"And may Heaven read it backwards.' Though she was rash,"
26605,SCENE I,'Twas a small fault for such a punishment!                         230
26606,SCENE I,
26607,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ Nay! 'twas my grief, and not my anger spoke."
26608,SCENE I,"Small fault indeed! but leave me, my poor girl!"
26609,SCENE I,I feel a weight that only prayer can lighten.
26610,SCENE I,
26611,SCENE I,[_Exit_ Attendant.
26612,SCENE I,
26613,SCENE I,"O they were innocent, and yet have perished"
26614,SCENE I,In their May of life; and Vice grows old in triumph.               235
26615,SCENE I,"Is it Mercy's hand, that for the bad man holds"
26616,SCENE I,Life's closing gate?----
26617,SCENE I,Still passing thence petitionary Hours
26618,SCENE I,To woo the obdurate spirit to repentance?
26619,SCENE I,"Or would this dullness tell me, that there is                      240"
26620,SCENE I,"Guilt too enormous to be duly punished,"
26621,SCENE I,Save by increase of guilt? The Powers of Evil
26622,SCENE I,"Are jealous claimants. Guilt too hath its ordeal,"
26623,SCENE I,"And Hell its own probation!--Merciful Heaven,"
26624,SCENE I,"Rather than this, pour down upon thy suppliant                     245"
26625,SCENE I,"Disease, and agony, and comfortless want!"
26626,SCENE I,"O send us forth to wander on, unsheltered!"
26627,SCENE I,Make our food bitter with despis√©d tears!
26628,SCENE I,Let viperous scorn hiss at us as we pass!
26629,SCENE I,"Yea, let us sink down at our enemy's gate,                         250"
26630,SCENE I,And beg forgiveness and a morsel of bread!
26631,SCENE I,With all the heaviest worldly visitations
26632,SCENE I,Let the dire father's curse that hovers o'er us
26633,SCENE I,"Work out its dread fulfilment, and the spirit"
26634,SCENE I,"Of wronged Kiuprili be appeased. But only,                         255"
26635,SCENE I,"Only, O merciful in vengeance! let not"
26636,SCENE I,That plague turn inward on my Casimir's soul!
26637,SCENE I,"Scare thence the fiend Ambition, and restore him"
26638,SCENE I,To his own heart! O save him! Save my husband!
26639,SCENE I,
26640,SCENE I,[_During the latter part of this speech EMERICK comes
26641,SCENE I,forward from his hiding-place. SAROLTA seeing
26642,SCENE I,"him, without recognising him._"
26643,SCENE I,
26644,SCENE I,In such a shape a father's curse should come.                      260
26645,SCENE I,
26646,SCENE I,_Emerick (advancing)._ Fear not.
26647,SCENE I,
26648,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                       Who art thou? Robber? Traitor?
26649,SCENE I,
26650,SCENE I,_Emerick._                                              Friend!
26651,SCENE I,"Who in good hour hath startled these dark fancies,"
26652,SCENE I,"Rapacious traitors, that would fain depose"
26653,SCENE I,"Joy, love, and beauty, from their natural thrones:"
26654,SCENE I,"Those lips, those angel eyes, that regal forehead.                 265"
26655,SCENE I,
26656,SCENE I,"_Sarolta_. Strengthen me, Heaven! I must not seem afraid!"
26657,SCENE I,
26658,SCENE I,[_Aside._
26659,SCENE I,
26660,SCENE I,The king to-night then deigns to play the masker.
26661,SCENE I,What seeks your Majesty?
26662,SCENE I,
26663,SCENE I,_Emerick._               Sarolta's love;
26664,SCENE I,And Emerick's power lies prostrate at her feet.
26665,SCENE I,
26666,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ Heaven guard the sovereign's power from such
26667,SCENE I,debasement!                                                    270
26668,SCENE I,"Far rather, Sire, let it descend in vengeance"
26669,SCENE I,"On the base villain, on the faithless slave"
26670,SCENE I,Who dared unbar the doors of these retirements!
26671,SCENE I,For whom? Has Casimir deserved this insult?
26672,SCENE I,O my misgiving heart! If--if--from Heaven                          275
26673,SCENE I,"Yet not from you, Lord Emerick!"
26674,SCENE I,
26675,SCENE I,_Emerick._                      Chiefly from me.
26676,SCENE I,Has he not like an ingrate robbed my court
26677,SCENE I,"Of Beauty's star, and kept my heart in darkness?"
26678,SCENE I,First then on him I will administer justice--
26679,SCENE I,"If not in mercy, yet in love and rapture.                          280"
26680,SCENE I,
26681,SCENE I,[_Seizes her._
26682,SCENE I,
26683,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ Help! Treason! Help!
26684,SCENE I,
26685,SCENE I,_Emerick._                      Call louder! Scream again!
26686,SCENE I,Here's none can hear you!
26687,SCENE I,
26688,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                Hear me, hear me, Heaven!"
26689,SCENE I,
26690,SCENE I,"_Emerick._ Nay, why this rage? Who best deserves you? Casimir,"
26691,SCENE I,"Emerick's bought implement, the jealous slave"
26692,SCENE I,That mews you up with bolts and bars? or Emerick                   285
26693,SCENE I,"Who proffers you a throne? Nay, mine you shall be."
26694,SCENE I,Hence with this fond resistance! Yield; then live
26695,SCENE I,"This month a widow, and the next a queen!"
26696,SCENE I,
26697,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ Yet, yet for one brief moment         [_Struggling._"

26699,SCENE I,
26700,SCENE I,"[_She throws him off, and rushes towards a toilet."
26701,SCENE I,"EMERICK follows, and as she takes a dagger,"
26702,SCENE I,he grasps it in her hand._
26703,SCENE I,
26704,SCENE I,_Emerick._                Ha! Ha! a dagger;                        290
26705,SCENE I,A seemly ornament for a lady's casket!
26706,SCENE I,"'Tis held, devotion is akin to love,"
26707,SCENE I,"But yours is tragic! Love in war! It charms me,"
26708,SCENE I,And makes your beauty worth a king's embraces!
26709,SCENE I,
26710,SCENE I,[_During this speech BETHLEN enters armed._
26711,SCENE I,

26713,SCENE I,
26714,SCENE I,_Emerick._ Pish! who is this?
26715,SCENE I,
26716,SCENE I,_Sarolta._                    O sleepless eye of Heaven!
26717,SCENE I,"A blest, a blessed spirit! Whence camest thou?"
26718,SCENE I,May I still call thee Bethlen?
26719,SCENE I,
26720,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._                     Ever, lady,"
26721,SCENE I,Your faithful soldier!
26722,SCENE I,
26723,SCENE I,_Emerick._             Insolent slave! Depart
26724,SCENE I,Know'st thou not me?
26725,SCENE I,
26726,SCENE I,_Bethlen._           I know thou art a villain                     300
26727,SCENE I,And coward! That thy devilish purpose marks thee!
26728,SCENE I,"What else, this lady must instruct my sword!"
26729,SCENE I,
26730,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._ Monster, retire! O touch him not, thou blest one!"
26731,SCENE I,This is the hour that fiends and damn√©d spirits
26732,SCENE I,"Do walk the earth, and take what form they list!                   305"
26733,SCENE I,Yon devil hath assumed a king's!
26734,SCENE I,
26735,SCENE I,_Bethlen._                       Usurped it!
26736,SCENE I,
26737,SCENE I,_Emerick._ The king will play the devil with thee indeed!
26738,SCENE I,"But that I mean to hear thee howl on the rack,"
26739,SCENE I,"I would debase this sword, and lay thee prostrate"
26740,SCENE I,At this thy paramour's feet; then drag her forth                   310
26741,SCENE I,"Stained with adulterous blood, and--"
26742,SCENE I,"--mark you, traitress!"
26743,SCENE I,"Strumpeted first, then turned adrift to beggary!"
26744,SCENE I,Thou prayed'st for't too.
26745,SCENE I,
26746,SCENE I,"_Sarolta._                Thou art so fiendish wicked,"
26747,SCENE I,That in thy blasphemies I scarce hear thy threats!
26748,SCENE I,
26749,SCENE I,"_Bethlen._ Lady, be calm! fear not this king of the buskin!        315"
26750,SCENE I,A king? Oh laughter! A king Bajazet!
26751,SCENE I,"That from some vagrant actor's tiring-room,"
26752,SCENE I,Hath stolen at once his speech and crown!
26753,SCENE I,
26754,SCENE I,_Emerick._                                Ah! treason!
26755,SCENE I,Thou hast been lessoned and tricked up for this!
26756,SCENE I,As surely as the wax on thy death-warrant                          320
26757,SCENE I,"Shall take the impression of this royal signet,"
26758,SCENE I,So plain thy face hath ta'en the mask of rebel!
26759,SCENE I,
26760,SCENE I,[_BETHLEN seizes EMERICK'S hand and eagerly observes the
26761,SCENE I,signet._
26762,SCENE I,
26763,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ It must be so! 'Tis e'en the counterpart!
26764,SCENE I,But with a foul usurping cypher on it!
26765,SCENE I,"The light hath flashed from Heaven, and I must follow it!          325"
26766,SCENE I,O curst usurper! O thou brother-murderer!
26767,SCENE I,That mad'st a star-bright queen a fugitive widow!
26768,SCENE I,"Who fill'st the land with curses, being thyself"
26769,SCENE I,All curses in one tyrant! see and tremble!
26770,SCENE I,This is Kiuprili's sword that now hangs o'er thee!                 330
26771,SCENE I,"Kiuprili's blasting curse, that from its point"
26772,SCENE I,"Shoots lightnings at thee. Hark! in Andreas' name,"
26773,SCENE I,"Heir of his vengeance, hell-hound! I defy thee."
26774,SCENE I,
26775,SCENE I,"[_They fight, and just as EMERICK is disarmed, in rush"
26776,SCENE I,"CASIMIR, OLD BATHORY, and_ Attendants. _CASIMIR"
26777,SCENE I,"runs in between the combatants, and parts them;"
26778,SCENE I,in the struggle BETHLEN'S sword is thrown down._
26779,SCENE I,
26780,SCENE I,_Casimir._ The king! disarmed too by a stranger! Speak!
26781,SCENE I,What may this mean?
26782,SCENE I,
26783,SCENE I,"_Emerick._          Deceived, dishonored lord!                     335"
26784,SCENE I,Ask thou yon fair adultress! She will tell thee
26785,SCENE I,"A tale, which would'st thou be both dupe and traitor,"
26786,SCENE I,Thou wilt believe against thy friend and sovereign!
26787,SCENE I,"Thou art present now, and a friend's duty ceases:"
26788,SCENE I,To thine own justice leave I thine own wrongs.                     340
26789,SCENE I,"Of half thy vengeance I perforce must rob thee,"
26790,SCENE I,For that the sovereign claims. To thy allegiance
26791,SCENE I,I now commit this traitor and assassin.
26792,SCENE I,
26793,SCENE I,[_Then to the_ Attendants.
26794,SCENE I,
26795,SCENE I,"Hence with him to the dungeon! and to-morrow,"
26796,SCENE I,"Ere the sun rises,--Hark! your heads or his!                       345"
26797,SCENE I,
26798,SCENE I,_Bethlen._ Can Hell work miracles to mock Heaven's justice?
26799,SCENE I,
26800,SCENE I,_Emerick._ Who speaks to him dies! The traitor that has menaced
26801,SCENE I,"His king, must not pollute the breathing air,"
26802,SCENE I,Even with a word!
26803,SCENE I,
26804,SCENE I,_Casimir (to Bathory)._ Hence with him to the dungeon!
26805,SCENE I,
26806,SCENE I,"[_Exit BETHLEN, hurried off by BATHORY and_ Attendants."
26807,SCENE I,
26808,SCENE I,_Emerick._ We hunt to-morrow in your upland forest:                350
26809,SCENE I,Thou (_to Casimir_) wilt attend us: and wilt then explain
26810,SCENE I,This sudden and most fortunate arrival.
26811,SCENE I,
26812,SCENE I,[_Exit EMERICK; Manent CASIMIR and SAROLTA._
26813,SCENE I,
26814,SCENE I,_Sarolta._ My lord! my husband! look whose sword lies yonder!
26815,SCENE I,"It is Kiuprili's, Casimir; 'tis thy father's!"
26816,SCENE I,"And wielded by a stripling's arm, it baffled,                      355"
26817,SCENE I,"Yea, fell like Heaven's own lightnings on that Tarquin."
26818,SCENE I,
26819,SCENE I,_Casimir._ Hush! hush!
26820,SCENE I,I had detected ere I left the city
26821,SCENE I,"The tyrant's curst intent. Lewd, damn√©d ingrate!"
26822,SCENE I,For him did I bring down a father's curse!                         360
26823,SCENE I,"Swift, swift must be our means! To-morrow's sun"
26824,SCENE I,Sets on his fate or mine! O blest Sarolta!
26825,SCENE I,"No other prayer, late penitent, dare I offer,"
26826,SCENE I,But that thy spotless virtues may prevail
26827,SCENE I,"O'er Casimir's crimes, and dread Kiuprili's curse!                 365"

26952,SCENE I,
26953,SCENE I,"Well met, Lord Rudolph!----"
26954,SCENE I,"Your whisper was not lost upon my ear,"
26955,SCENE I,And I dare trust--
26956,SCENE I,
26957,SCENE I,_Lord Rudolph._    Enough! the time is precious!
26958,SCENE I,You left Temeswar late on yester-eve?                                5
26959,SCENE I,And sojourned there some hours?
26960,SCENE I,
26961,SCENE I,_Casimir._                      I did so!
26962,SCENE I,
26963,SCENE I,_Lord Rudolph._                           Heard you
26964,SCENE I,Aught of a hunt preparing?
26965,SCENE I,
26966,SCENE I,_Casimir._                 Yes; and met
26967,SCENE I,The assembled huntsmen!
26968,SCENE I,
26969,SCENE I,_Lord Rudolph._         Was there no word given?
26970,SCENE I,
26971,SCENE I,_Casimir._ The word for me was this:--The royal Leopard
26972,SCENE I,Chases thy milk-white dedicated Hind.                               10
26973,SCENE I,

26989,SCENE I,Of Bethlen with his guards?
26990,SCENE I,
26991,SCENE I,_Casimir._                  O he received it
26992,SCENE I,"As evidence of their mutual guilt. In fine,                         20"
26993,SCENE I,"With cozening warmth condoled with, and dismissed me."
26994,SCENE I,
26995,SCENE I,_Lord Rudolph._ I entered as the door was closing on you:
26996,SCENE I,"His eye was fixed, yet seemed to follow you,--"
26997,SCENE I,"With such a look of hate, and scorn and triumph,"
26998,SCENE I,"As if he had you in the toils already,                              25"
26999,SCENE I,And were then choosing where to stab you first.
27000,SCENE I,But hush! draw back!
27001,SCENE I,
27002,SCENE I,_Casimir._           This nook is at the furthest
27003,SCENE I,From any beaten track.

27010,SCENE I,
27011,SCENE I,_Lord Rudolph._ One of the two I recognized this morning;
27012,SCENE I,His name is Pestalutz: a trusty ruffian                             30
27013,SCENE I,Whose face is prologue still to some dark murder.
27014,SCENE I,"Beware no stratagem, no trick of message,"
27015,SCENE I,Dispart you from your servants.
27016,SCENE I,
27017,SCENE I,_Casimir (aside)._              I deserve it.
27018,SCENE I,The comrade of that ruffian is my servant:
27019,SCENE I,The one I trusted most and most preferred.                          35
27020,SCENE I,But we must part. What makes the king so late?
27021,SCENE I,It was his wont to be an early stirrer.
27022,SCENE I,
27023,SCENE I,_Lord Rudolph._                         And his main policy.
27024,SCENE I,To enthral the sluggard nature in ourselves
27025,SCENE I,"Is, in good truth, the better half of the secret"
27026,SCENE I,To enthral the world: for the will governs all.                     40
27027,SCENE I,"See, the sky lowers! the cross-winds waywardly"
27028,SCENE I,Chase the fantastic masses of the clouds
27029,SCENE I,With a wild mockery of the coming hunt!
27030,SCENE I,
27031,SCENE I,_Casimir._ Mark yonder mass! I make it wear the shape
27032,SCENE I,Of a huge ram that butts with head depressed.                       45

27036,SCENE I,"Which, if bards lie not, the Sea-shepherds tend,"
27037,SCENE I,Glaucus or Proteus. But my fancy shapes it
27038,SCENE I,A monster couchant on a rocky shelf.
27039,SCENE I,
27040,SCENE I,_Casimir._ Mark too the edges of the lurid mass--                   50
27041,SCENE I,"Restless, as if some idly-vexing Sprite,"
27042,SCENE I,"On swift wing coasting by, with tetchy hand"
27043,SCENE I,Pluck'd at the ringlets of the vaporous Fleece.
27044,SCENE I,"These are sure signs of conflict nigh at hand,"
27045,SCENE I,And elemental war!
27046,SCENE I,
27047,SCENE I,[_A single trumpet heard at some distance._
27048,SCENE I,

27050,SCENE I,Announces that the tyrant's pawing courser
27051,SCENE I,Neighs at the gate.                                [_Trumpets._

27061,SCENE I,Expect our sworn confederates from Temeswar.                        65
27062,SCENE I,"I trust, ere yet this clouded sun slopes westward,"
27063,SCENE I,"That Emerick's death, or Casimir's, will appease"
27064,SCENE I,The manes of Zapolya and Kiuprili!             [_Exit RUDOLPH._
27065,SCENE I,"The traitor, Laska!----"

27067,SCENE I,"Could see him as he was, and often warned me."
27068,SCENE I,Whence learned she this?--O she was innocent!
27069,SCENE I,And to be innocent is Nature's wisdom!
27070,SCENE I,"The fledge-dove knows the prowlers of the air,"
27071,SCENE I,"Feared soon as seen, and flutters back to shelter.                  75"
27072,SCENE I,"And the young steed recoils upon his haunches,"

27075,SCENE I,"Is that fine sense, which to the pure in heart,"
27076,SCENE I,"By mere oppugnancy of their own goodness,                           80"

27078,SCENE I,"O fool! O parricide! through yon wood did'st thou,"

27080,SCENE I,A widow and an orphan. Dar'st thou then
27081,SCENE I,(Curse-laden wretch) put forth these hands to raise                 85
27082,SCENE I,"The ark, all sacred, of thy country's cause?"
27083,SCENE I,"Look down in pity on thy son, Kiuprili!"
27084,SCENE I,"And let this deep abhorrence of his crime,"
27085,SCENE I,"Unstained with selfish fears, be his atonement!"

32470,I.,"""God save thee, ancyent Marinere!"
32471,I.,"""From the fiends that plague thee thus--"
32472,I.,"""Why look'st thou so?""--with my cross bow"
32473,I.,I shot the Albatross.                                             80
32474,I.,
32475,I.,
32476,II.,II.
32477,II.,
32478,II.,"The Sun came up upon the right,"
32479,II.,Out of the Sea came he;
32480,II.,And broad as a weft upon the left
32481,II.,Went down into the Sea.
32482,II.,
32483,II.,"And the good south wind still blew behind,                          85"
32484,II.,But no sweet Bird did follow
32485,II.,Ne any day for food or play
32486,II.,Came to the Marinere's hollo!
32487,II.,
32488,II.,And I had done an hellish thing
32489,II.,And it would work 'em woe:                                        90
32490,II.,"For all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird"
32491,II.,That made the Breeze to blow.
32492,II.,
32493,II.,"Ne dim ne red, like God's own head,"
32494,II.,The glorious Sun uprist:
32495,II.,"Then all averr'd, I had kill'd the Bird                             95"
32496,II.,That brought the fog and mist.
32497,II.,"'Twas right, said they, such birds to slay"
32498,II.,That bring the fog and mist.
32499,II.,
32500,II.,"The breezes blew, the white foam flew,"
32501,II.,The furrow follow'd free:                                        100
32502,II.,We were the first that ever burst
32503,II.,Into that silent Sea.
32504,II.,
32505,II.,"Down dropt the breeze, the Sails dropt down,"
32506,II.,'Twas sad as sad could be
32507,II.,And we did speak only to break                                     105
32508,II.,The silence of the Sea.
32509,II.,
32510,II.,All in a hot and copper sky
32511,II.,"The bloody sun at noon,"
32512,II.,"Right up above the mast did stand,"
32513,II.,No bigger than the moon.                                         110
32514,II.,
32515,II.,"Day after day, day after day,"
32516,II.,"We stuck, ne breath ne motion."
32517,II.,As idle as a painted Ship
32518,II.,Upon a painted Ocean.
32519,II.,
32520,II.,"Water, water, every where,                                         115"
32521,II.,And all the boards did shrink:
32522,II.,"Water, water, everywhere,"
32523,II.,Ne any drop to drink.
32524,II.,
32525,II.,The very deeps did rot: O Christ!
32526,II.,That ever this should be!                                        120
32527,II.,"Yea, slimy things did crawl with legs"
32528,II.,Upon the slimy Sea.
32529,II.,
32530,II.,"About, about, in reel and rout,"
32531,II.,The Death-fires danc'd at night;
32532,II.,"The water, like a witch's oils,                                    125"
32533,II.,burnt green and blue and white.
32534,II.,
32535,II.,And some in dreams assured were
32536,II.,Of the Spirit that plagued us so:
32537,II.,Nine fathom deep he had follow'd us
32538,II.,From the Land of Mist and Snow.                                  130
32539,II.,
32540,II.,And every tongue thro' utter drouth
32541,II.,Was wither'd at the root;
32542,II.,We could not speak no more than if
32543,II.,We had been choked with soot.
32544,II.,
32545,II.,Ah wel-a-day! what evil looks                                      135
32546,II.,Had I from old and young;
32547,II.,Instead of the Cross the Albatross
32548,II.,About my neck was hung.
32549,II.,
32550,II.,
32551,III.,III.
32552,III.,
32553,III.,I saw a something in the Sky
32554,III.,No bigger than my fist;                                          140
32555,III.,At first it seem'd a little speck
32556,III.,And then it seem'd a mist:
32557,III.,"It mov'd and mov'd, and took at last"
32558,III.,"A certain shape, I wist."
32559,III.,
32560,III.,"A speck, a mist, a shape, I wist!                                  145"
32561,III.,And still it ner'd and ner'd;
32562,III.,"And, an it dodg'd a water-sprite,"
32563,III.,It plung'd and tack'd and veer'd.
32564,III.,
32565,III.,"With throat unslack'd, with black lips bak'd"
32566,III.,"Ne could we laugh, ne wail:                                      150"
32567,III.,Then while thro' drouth all dumb they stood
32568,III.,I bit my arm and suck'd the blood
32569,III.,"And cry'd, A sail! a sail!"
32570,III.,
32571,III.,"With throat unslack'd, with black lips bak'd"
32572,III.,Agape they hear'd me call:                                       155
32573,III.,Gramercy! they for joy did grin
32574,III.,And all at once their breath drew in
32575,III.,As they were drinking all.
32576,III.,
32577,III.,She doth not tack from side to side--
32578,III.,Hither to work us weal                                           160
32579,III.,"Withouten wind, withouten tide"
32580,III.,She steddies with upright keel.
32581,III.,
32582,III.,"The western wave was all a flame,"
32583,III.,The day was well nigh done!
32584,III.,Almost upon the western wave                                       165
32585,III.,Rested the broad bright Sun;
32586,III.,When that strange shape drove suddenly
32587,III.,Betwixt us and the Sun.
32588,III.,
32589,III.,And strait the Sun was fleck'd with bars
32590,III.,(Heaven's mother send us grace)                                  170
32591,III.,As if thro' a dungeon grate he peer'd
32592,III.,With broad and burning face.
32593,III.,
32594,III.,"Alas! (thought I, and my heart beat loud)"
32595,III.,How fast she neres and neres!
32596,III.,Are those _her_ Sails that glance in the Sun                       175
32597,III.,Like restless gossameres?
32598,III.,
32599,III.,"Are those _her_ naked ribs, which fleck'd"
32600,III.,The sun that did behind them peer?
32601,III.,"And are those two all, all the crew,"
32602,III.,That woman and her fleshless Pheere?                             180
32603,III.,
32604,III.,"_His_ bones were black with many a crack,"
32605,III.,"All black and bare, I ween;"
32606,III.,"Jet-black and bare, save where with rust"
32607,III.,Of mouldy damps and charnel crust
32608,III.,They're patch'd with purple and green.                           185
32609,III.,
32610,III.,"_Her_ lips are red, _her_ looks are free,"
32611,III.,_Her_ locks are yellow as gold:
32612,III.,"Her skin is as white as leprosy,"
32613,III.,And she is far liker Death than he;
32614,III.,Her flesh makes the still air cold.                              190
32615,III.,
32616,III.,The naked Hulk alongside came
32617,III.,And the Twain were playing dice;
32618,III.,"""The Game is done! I've won, I've won!"""
32619,III.,"Quoth she, and whistled thrice."
32620,III.,
32621,III.,A gust of wind sterte up behind                                    195
32622,III.,And whistled thro' his bones;
32623,III.,Thro' the holes of his eyes and the hole of his mouth
32624,III.,Half-whistles and half-groans.
32625,III.,
32626,III.,With never a whisper in the Sea
32627,III.,Off darts the Spectre-ship;                                      200
32628,III.,While clombe above the Eastern bar
32629,III.,"The horned Moon, with one bright Star"
32630,III.,Almost atween the tips.
32631,III.,
32632,III.,One after one by the horned Moon
32633,III.,"(Listen, O Stranger! to me)                                      205"
32634,III.,Each turn'd his face with a ghastly pang
32635,III.,And curs'd me with his ee.
32636,III.,
32637,III.,"Four times fifty living men,"
32638,III.,"With never a sigh or groan,"
32639,III.,"With heavy thump, a lifeless lump                                  210"
32640,III.,They dropp'd down one by one.
32641,III.,
32642,III.,"Their souls did from their bodies fly,--"
32643,III.,They fled to bliss or woe;
32644,III.,"And every soul it pass'd me by,"
32645,III.,Like the whiz of my Cross-bow.                                   215
32646,III.,
32647,III.,
32648,IV.,IV.
32649,IV.,
32650,IV.,"""I fear thee, ancyent Marinere!"
32651,IV.,"""I fear thy skinny hand;"
32652,IV.,"""And thou art long, and lank, and brown,"
32653,IV.,"""As is the ribb'd Sea-sand."
32654,IV.,
32655,IV.,"""I fear thee and thy glittering eye                                220"
32656,IV.,"""And thy skinny hand so brown--"
32657,IV.,"Fear not, fear not, thou wedding guest!"
32658,IV.,This body dropt not down.
32659,IV.,
32660,IV.,"Alone, alone, all all alone"
32661,IV.,Alone on the wide wide Sea;                                      225
32662,IV.,And Christ would take no pity on
32663,IV.,My soul in agony.
32664,IV.,
32665,IV.,"The many men so beautiful,"
32666,IV.,And they all dead did lie!
32667,IV.,And a million million slimy things                                 230
32668,IV.,Liv'd on--and so did I.
32669,IV.,
32670,IV.,"I look'd upon the rotting Sea,"
32671,IV.,And drew my eyes away;
32672,IV.,"I look'd upon the eldritch deck,"
32673,IV.,And there the dead men lay.                                      235
32674,IV.,
32675,IV.,"I look'd to Heav'n, and try'd to pray;"
32676,IV.,"But or ever a prayer had gusht,"
32677,IV.,A wicked whisper came and made
32678,IV.,My heart as dry as dust.
32679,IV.,
32680,IV.,"I clos'd my lids and kept them close,                              240"
32681,IV.,Till the balls like pulses beat;
32682,IV.,"For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky"
32683,IV.,"Lay like a load on my weary eye,"
32684,IV.,And the dead were at my feet.
32685,IV.,
32686,IV.,"The cold sweat melted from their limbs,                            245"
32687,IV.,"Ne rot, ne reek did they;"
32688,IV.,"The look with which they look'd on me,"
32689,IV.,Had never pass'd away.
32690,IV.,
32691,IV.,An orphan's curse would drag to Hell
32692,IV.,A spirit from on high:                                           250
32693,IV.,But O! more horrible than that
32694,IV.,Is the curse in a dead man's eye!
32695,IV.,"Seven days, seven nights I saw that curse,"
32696,IV.,And yet I could not die.
32697,IV.,
32698,IV.,"The moving Moon went up the sky,                                   255"
32699,IV.,And no where did abide:
32700,IV.,Softly she was going up
32701,IV.,And a star or two beside--
32702,IV.,
32703,IV.,Her beams bemock'd the sultry main
32704,IV.,Like morning frosts yspread;                                     260
32705,IV.,"But where the ship's huge shadow lay,"
32706,IV.,The charmed water burnt alway
32707,IV.,A still and awful red.
32708,IV.,
32709,IV.,Beyond the shadow of the ship
32710,IV.,I watch'd the water-snakes:                                      265
32711,IV.,They mov'd in tracks of shining white;
32712,IV.,"And when they rear'd, the elfish light"
32713,IV.,Fell off in hoary flakes.
32714,IV.,
32715,IV.,Within the shadow of the ship
32716,IV.,I watch'd their rich attire:                                     270
32717,IV.,"Blue, glossy green, and velvet black"
32718,IV.,They coil'd and swam; and every track
32719,IV.,Was a flash of golden fire.
32720,IV.,
32721,IV.,O happy living things! no tongue
32722,IV.,Their beauty might declare:                                      275
32723,IV.,"A spring of love gusht from my heart,"
32724,IV.,And I bless'd them unaware!
32725,IV.,"Sure my kind saint took pity on me,"
32726,IV.,And I bless'd them unaware.
32727,IV.,
32728,IV.,The self-same moment I could pray;                                 280
32729,IV.,And from my neck so free
32730,IV.,"The Albatross fell off, and sank"
32731,IV.,Like lead into the sea.
32732,IV.,
32733,IV.,
32734,V.,V.
32735,V.,
32736,V.,"O sleep, it is a gentle thing,"
32737,V.,Belov'd from pole to pole!                                       285
32738,V.,To Mary-queen the praise be yeven
32739,V.,She sent the gentle sleep from heaven
32740,V.,That slid into my soul.
32741,V.,
32742,V.,The silly buckets on the deck
32743,V.,"That had so long remain'd,                                       290"
32744,V.,I dreamt that they were fill'd with dew
32745,V.,And when I awoke it rain'd.
32746,V.,
32747,V.,"My lips were wet, my throat was cold,"
32748,V.,My garments all were dank;
32749,V.,Sure I had drunken in my dreams                                    295
32750,V.,And still my body drank.
32751,V.,
32752,V.,"I mov'd and could not feel my limbs,"
32753,V.,"I was so light, almost"
32754,V.,"I thought that I had died in sleep,"
32755,V.,And was a blessed Ghost.                                         300
32756,V.,
32757,V.,"The roaring wind! it roar'd far off,"
32758,V.,It did not come anear;
32759,V.,But with its sound it shook the sails
32760,V.,That were so thin and sere.
32761,V.,
32762,V.,"The upper air bursts into life,                                    305"
32763,V.,And a hundred fire-flags sheen
32764,V.,To and fro they are hurried about;
32765,V.,"And to and fro, and in and out"
32766,V.,The stars dance on between.
32767,V.,
32768,V.,The coming wind doth roar more loud;                               310
32769,V.,"The sails do sigh, like sedge:"
32770,V.,The rain pours down from one black cloud
32771,V.,And the Moon is at its edge.
32772,V.,
32773,V.,"Hark! hark! the thick black cloud is cleft,"
32774,V.,And the Moon is at its side:                                     315
32775,V.,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
32776,V.,The lightning falls with never a jag
32777,V.,A river steep and wide.
32778,V.,
32779,V.,The strong wind reach'd the ship: it roar'd
32780,V.,"And dropp'd down, like a stone!                                  320"
32781,V.,Beneath the lightning and the moon
32782,V.,The dead men gave a groan.
32783,V.,
32784,V.,"They groan'd, they stirr'd, they all uprose,"
32785,V.,"Ne spake, ne mov'd their eyes:"
32786,V.,"It had been strange, even in a dream                               325"
32787,V.,To have seen those dead men rise.
32788,V.,
32789,V.,"The helmsman steer'd, the ship mov'd on;"
32790,V.,Yet never a breeze up-blew;
32791,V.,"The Marineres all 'gan work the ropes,"
32792,V.,Where they were wont to do:                                      330
32793,V.,They rais'd their limbs like lifeless tools--
32794,V.,We were a ghastly crew.
32795,V.,
32796,V.,The body of my brother's son
32797,V.,Stood by me knee to knee:
32798,V.,"The body and I pull'd at one rope,                                 335"
32799,V.,But he said nought to me--
32800,V.,And I quak'd to think of my own voice
32801,V.,How frightful it would be!
32802,V.,
32803,V.,"The day-light dawn'd--they dropp'd their arms,"
32804,V.,And cluster'd round the mast:                                    340
32805,V.,Sweet sounds rose slowly thro' their mouths
32806,V.,And from their bodies pass'd.
32807,V.,
32808,V.,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
32809,V.,Then darted to the sun:
32810,V.,Slowly the sounds came back again                                  345
32811,V.,"Now mix'd, now one by one."
32812,V.,
32813,V.,Sometimes a dropping from the sky
32814,V.,I heard the Lavrock sing;
32815,V.,Sometimes all little birds that are
32816,V.,How they seem'd to fill the sea and air                            350
32817,V.,With their sweet jargoning.
32818,V.,
32819,V.,"And now 'twas like all instruments,"
32820,V.,Now like a lonely flute;
32821,V.,And now it is an angel's song
32822,V.,That makes the heavens be mute.                                  355
32823,V.,
32824,V.,It ceas'd: yet still the sails made on
32825,V.,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
32826,V.,A noise like of a hidden brook
32827,V.,"In the leafy month of June,"
32828,V.,That to the sleeping woods all night                               360
32829,V.,Singeth a quiet tune.
32830,V.,
32831,V.,"Listen, O listen, thou Wedding-guest!"
32832,V.,"""Marinere! thou hast thy will:"
32833,V.,"""For that, which comes out of thine eye, doth make"
32834,V.,"""My body and soul to be still.""                                  365"
32835,V.,
32836,V.,Never sadder tale was told
32837,V.,To a man of woman born:
32838,V.,Sadder and wiser thou wedding-guest!
32839,V.,Thou'lt rise to-morrow morn.
32840,V.,
32841,V.,Never sadder tale was heard                                        370
32842,V.,By a man of woman born:
32843,V.,The Marineres all return'd to work
32844,V.,As silent as beforne.
32845,V.,
32846,V.,"The Marineres all 'gan pull the ropes,"
32847,V.,But look at me they n'old:                                       375
32848,V.,"Thought I, I am as thin as air--"
32849,V.,They cannot me behold.
32850,V.,
32851,V.,Till noon we silently sail'd on
32852,V.,Yet never a breeze did breathe:
32853,V.,Slowly and smoothly went the ship                                  380
32854,V.,Mov'd onward from beneath.
32855,V.,
32856,V.,Under the keel nine fathom deep
32857,V.,From the land of mist and snow
32858,V.,The spirit slid: and it was He
32859,V.,That made the Ship to go.                                        385
32860,V.,The sails at noon left off their tune
32861,V.,And the Ship stood still also.
32862,V.,
32863,V.,The sun right up above the mast
32864,V.,Had fix'd her to the ocean:
32865,V.,But in a minute she 'gan stir                                      390
32866,V.,With a short uneasy motion--
32867,V.,Backwards and forwards half her length
32868,V.,With a short uneasy motion.
32869,V.,
32870,V.,"Then, like a pawing horse let go,"
32871,V.,She made a sudden bound:                                         395
32872,V.,"It flung the blood into my head,"
32873,V.,And I fell into a swound.
32874,V.,
32875,V.,"How long in that same fit I lay,"
32876,V.,I have not to declare;
32877,V.,"But ere my living life return'd,                                   400"
32878,V.,I heard and in my soul discern'd
32879,V.,"Two voices in the air,"
32880,V.,
32881,V.,"""Is it he?"" quoth one, ""Is this the man?"
32882,V.,"""By him who died on cross,"
32883,V.,"""With his cruel bow he lay'd full low                              405"
32884,V.,"""The harmless Albatross."
32885,V.,
32886,V.,"""The spirit who 'bideth by himself"
32887,V.,"""In the land of mist and snow,"
32888,V.,"""He lov'd the bird that lov'd the man"
32889,V.,"""Who shot him with his bow.                                      410"
32890,V.,
32891,V.,"The other was a softer voice,"
32892,V.,As soft as honey-dew:
32893,V.,"Quoth he the man hath penance done,"
32894,V.,And penance more will do.
32895,V.,
32896,V.,
32897,VI.,VI.
32898,VI.,
32899,VI.,
32900,FIRST VOICE.,FIRST VOICE.
32901,FIRST VOICE.,
32902,FIRST VOICE.,"""But tell me, tell me! speak again,                                415"
32903,FIRST VOICE.,"""Thy soft response renewing--"

32906,FIRST VOICE.,
32907,FIRST VOICE.,
32908,SECOND VOICE.,SECOND VOICE.
32909,SECOND VOICE.,
32910,SECOND VOICE.,"""Still as a Slave before his Lord,"
32911,SECOND VOICE.,"""The Ocean hath no blast:                                        420"
32912,SECOND VOICE.,"""His great bright eye most silently"
32913,SECOND VOICE.,"""Up to the moon is cast--"
32914,SECOND VOICE.,
32915,SECOND VOICE.,"""If he may know which way to go,"
32916,SECOND VOICE.,"""For she guides him smooth or grim."
32917,SECOND VOICE.,"""See, brother, see! how graciously                                 425"
32918,SECOND VOICE.,"""She looketh down on him."
32919,SECOND VOICE.,
32920,SECOND VOICE.,
32921,FIRST VOICE.,FIRST VOICE.
32922,FIRST VOICE.,
32923,FIRST VOICE.,"""But why drives on that ship so fast"
32924,FIRST VOICE.,"""Withouten wave or wind?"

32926,FIRST VOICE.,
32927,SECOND VOICE.,SECOND VOICE.
32928,SECOND VOICE.,
32929,SECOND VOICE.,"""The air is cut away before,"
32930,SECOND VOICE.,"""And closes from behind.                                         430"
32931,SECOND VOICE.,
32932,SECOND VOICE.,"""Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high,"
32933,SECOND VOICE.,"""Or we shall be belated:"
32934,SECOND VOICE.,"""For slow and slow that ship will go,"
32935,SECOND VOICE.,"""When the Marinere's trance is abated."""
32936,SECOND VOICE.,
32937,SECOND VOICE.,"I woke, and we were sailing on                                     435"
32938,SECOND VOICE.,As in a gentle weather:
32939,SECOND VOICE.,"'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;"
32940,SECOND VOICE.,The dead men stood together.
32941,SECOND VOICE.,
32942,SECOND VOICE.,"All stood together on the deck,"
32943,SECOND VOICE.,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:                                    440
32944,SECOND VOICE.,All fix'd on me their stony eyes
32945,SECOND VOICE.,That in the moon did glitter.
32946,SECOND VOICE.,
32947,SECOND VOICE.,"The pang, the curse, with which they died,"
32948,SECOND VOICE.,Had never pass'd away:
32949,SECOND VOICE.,I could not draw my een from theirs                                445
32950,SECOND VOICE.,Ne turn them up to pray.
32951,SECOND VOICE.,
32952,SECOND VOICE.,"And in its time the spell was snapt,"
32953,SECOND VOICE.,And I could move my een:
32954,SECOND VOICE.,"I look'd far-forth, but little saw"
32955,SECOND VOICE.,Of what might else be seen.                                      450
32956,SECOND VOICE.,
32957,SECOND VOICE.,"Like one, that on a lonely road"
32958,SECOND VOICE.,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
32959,SECOND VOICE.,"And having once turn'd round, walks on"
32960,SECOND VOICE.,And turns no more his head:
32961,SECOND VOICE.,"Because he knows, a frightful fiend                                455"
32962,SECOND VOICE.,Doth close behind him tread.
32963,SECOND VOICE.,
32964,SECOND VOICE.,"But soon there breath'd a wind on me,"
32965,SECOND VOICE.,Ne sound ne motion made:
32966,SECOND VOICE.,Its path was not upon the sea
32967,SECOND VOICE.,In ripple or in shade.                                           460
32968,SECOND VOICE.,
32969,SECOND VOICE.,"It rais'd my hair, it fann'd my cheek,"
32970,SECOND VOICE.,Like a meadow-gale of spring--
32971,SECOND VOICE.,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
32972,SECOND VOICE.,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
32973,SECOND VOICE.,
32974,SECOND VOICE.,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,                                    465"
32975,SECOND VOICE.,Yet she sail'd softly too:
32976,SECOND VOICE.,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--"
32977,SECOND VOICE.,On me alone it blew.
32978,SECOND VOICE.,
32979,SECOND VOICE.,O dream of joy! is this indeed
32980,SECOND VOICE.,The light-house top I see?                                       470
32981,SECOND VOICE.,Is this the Hill? Is this the Kirk?
32982,SECOND VOICE.,Is this mine own countr√©e?
32983,SECOND VOICE.,
32984,SECOND VOICE.,"We drifted o'er the Harbour-bar,"
32985,SECOND VOICE.,And I with sobs did pray--
32986,SECOND VOICE.,"""O let me be awake, my God!                                        475"
32987,SECOND VOICE.,"""Or let me sleep alway!"""
32988,SECOND VOICE.,
32989,SECOND VOICE.,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,"
32990,SECOND VOICE.,So smoothly it was strewn!
32991,SECOND VOICE.,"And on the bay the moon light lay,"
32992,SECOND VOICE.,And the shadow of the moon.                                      480
32993,SECOND VOICE.,
32994,SECOND VOICE.,"The moonlight bay was white all o'er,"
32995,SECOND VOICE.,"Till rising from the same,"
32996,SECOND VOICE.,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
32997,SECOND VOICE.,Like as of torches came.
32998,SECOND VOICE.,
32999,SECOND VOICE.,A little distance from the prow                                    485
33000,SECOND VOICE.,Those dark-red shadows were;
33001,SECOND VOICE.,But soon I saw that my own flesh
33002,SECOND VOICE.,Was red as in a glare.
33003,SECOND VOICE.,
33004,SECOND VOICE.,"I turn'd my head in fear and dread,"
33005,SECOND VOICE.,"And by the holy rood,                                            490"
33006,SECOND VOICE.,"The bodies had advanc'd, and now"
33007,SECOND VOICE.,Before the mast they stood.
33008,SECOND VOICE.,
33009,SECOND VOICE.,"They lifted up their stiff right arms,"
33010,SECOND VOICE.,They held them strait and tight;
33011,SECOND VOICE.,"And each right-arm burnt like a torch,                             495"
33012,SECOND VOICE.,A torch that's borne upright.
33013,SECOND VOICE.,Their stony eye-balls glitter'd on
33014,SECOND VOICE.,In the red and smoky light.
33015,SECOND VOICE.,
33016,SECOND VOICE.,I pray'd and turn'd my head away
33017,SECOND VOICE.,Forth looking as before.                                         500
33018,SECOND VOICE.,"There was no breeze upon the bay,"
33019,SECOND VOICE.,No wave against the shore.
33020,SECOND VOICE.,
33021,SECOND VOICE.,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less"
33022,SECOND VOICE.,That stands above the rock:
33023,SECOND VOICE.,The moonlight steep'd in silentness                                505
33024,SECOND VOICE.,The steady weathercock.
33025,SECOND VOICE.,
33026,SECOND VOICE.,"And the bay was white with silent light,"
33027,SECOND VOICE.,Till rising from the same
33028,SECOND VOICE.,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
33029,SECOND VOICE.,In crimson colours came.                                         510
33030,SECOND VOICE.,
33031,SECOND VOICE.,A little distance from the prow
33032,SECOND VOICE.,Those crimson shadows were:
33033,SECOND VOICE.,I turn'd my eyes upon the deck--
33034,SECOND VOICE.,O Christ! what saw I there?
33035,SECOND VOICE.,
33036,SECOND VOICE.,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat;                            515"
33037,SECOND VOICE.,And by the Holy rood
33038,SECOND VOICE.,"A man all light, a seraph-man,"
33039,SECOND VOICE.,On every corse there stood.
33040,SECOND VOICE.,
33041,SECOND VOICE.,"This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand:"
33042,SECOND VOICE.,It was a heavenly sight:                                         520
33043,SECOND VOICE.,"They stood as signals to the land,"
33044,SECOND VOICE.,Each one a lovely light:
33045,SECOND VOICE.,
33046,SECOND VOICE.,"This seraph-band, each wav'd his hand,"
33047,SECOND VOICE.,No voice did they impart--
33048,SECOND VOICE.,"No voice; but O! the silence sank,                                 525"
33049,SECOND VOICE.,Like music on my heart.
33050,SECOND VOICE.,
33051,SECOND VOICE.,"Eftsones I heard the dash of oars,"
33052,SECOND VOICE.,I heard the pilot's cheer:
33053,SECOND VOICE.,My head was turn'd perforce away
33054,SECOND VOICE.,And I saw a boat appear.                                         530
33055,SECOND VOICE.,
33056,SECOND VOICE.,Then vanish'd all the lovely lights;
33057,SECOND VOICE.,The bodies rose anew:
33058,SECOND VOICE.,"With silent pace, each to his place,"
33059,SECOND VOICE.,Came back the ghastly crew.
33060,SECOND VOICE.,"The wind, that shade nor motion made,                              535"
33061,SECOND VOICE.,On me alone it blew.
33062,SECOND VOICE.,
33063,SECOND VOICE.,"The pilot, and the pilot's boy"
33064,SECOND VOICE.,I heard them coming fast:
33065,SECOND VOICE.,"Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy,"
33066,SECOND VOICE.,The dead men could not blast.                                    540
33067,SECOND VOICE.,
33068,SECOND VOICE.,I saw a third--I heard his voice:
33069,SECOND VOICE.,It is the Hermit good!
33070,SECOND VOICE.,He singeth loud his godly hymns
33071,SECOND VOICE.,That he makes in the wood.
33072,SECOND VOICE.,"He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away                             545"
33073,SECOND VOICE.,The Albatross's blood.
33074,SECOND VOICE.,
33075,SECOND VOICE.,
33076,VII.,VII.
33077,VII.,
33078,VII.,This Hermit good lives in that wood
33079,VII.,Which slopes down to the Sea.
33080,VII.,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
33081,VII.,He loves to talk with Marineres                                    550
33082,VII.,That come from a far Contr√©e.
33083,VII.,
33084,VII.,He kneels at morn and noon and eve--
33085,VII.,He hath a cushion plump:
33086,VII.,"It is the moss, that wholly hides"
33087,VII.,The rotted old Oak-stump.                                        555
33088,VII.,
33089,VII.,"The Skiff-boat ne'rd: I heard them talk,"
33090,VII.,"""Why, this is strange, I trow!"
33091,VII.,"""Where are those lights so many and fair"
33092,VII.,"""That signal made but now?"
33093,VII.,
33094,VII.,"""Strange, by my faith! the Hermit said--                           560"
33095,VII.,"""And they answer'd not our cheer."
33096,VII.,"""The planks look warp'd, and see those sails"
33097,VII.,"""How thin they are and sere!"
33098,VII.,"""I never saw aught like to them"
33099,VII.,"""Unless perchance it were                                        565"
33100,VII.,
33101,VII.,"""The skeletons of leaves that lag"
33102,VII.,"""My forest-brook along:"
33103,VII.,"""When the Ivy-tod is heavy with snow,"
33104,VII.,"""And the Owlet whoops to the wolf below"
33105,VII.,"""That eats the she-wolfs young.                                  570"
33106,VII.,
33107,VII.,"""Dear Lord! it has a fiendish look--"
33108,VII.,(The Pilot made reply)
33109,VII.,"""I am afear'd--""Push on, push on!"
33110,VII.,"""Said the Hermit cheerily."
33111,VII.,
33112,VII.,"The Boat came closer to the Ship,                                  575"
33113,VII.,But I ne spake ne stirr'd!
33114,VII.,"The Boat came close beneath the Ship,"
33115,VII.,And strait a sound was heard!
33116,VII.,
33117,VII.,"Under the water it rumbled on,"
33118,VII.,Still louder and more dread:                                     580
33119,VII.,"It reach'd the Ship, it split the bay;"
33120,VII.,The Ship went down like lead.
33121,VII.,
33122,VII.,"Stunn'd by that loud and dreadful sound,"
33123,VII.,Which sky and ocean smote:
33124,VII.,Like one that had been seven days drown'd                          585
33125,VII.,My body lay afloat:
33126,VII.,"But, swift as dreams, myself I found"
33127,VII.,Within the Pilot's boat.
33128,VII.,
33129,VII.,"Upon the whirl, where sank the Ship,"
33130,VII.,The boat spun round and round:                                   590
33131,VII.,"And all was still, save that the hill"
33132,VII.,Was telling of the sound.
33133,VII.,
33134,VII.,I mov'd my lips: the Pilot shriek'd
33135,VII.,And fell down in a fit.
33136,VII.,The Holy Hermit rais'd his eyes                                    595
33137,VII.,And pray'd where he did sit.
33138,VII.,
33139,VII.,"I took the oars: the Pilot's boy,"
33140,VII.,"Who now doth crazy go,"
33141,VII.,"Laugh'd loud and long, and all the while"
33142,VII.,"His eyes went to and fro,                                        600"
33143,VII.,"""Ha! ha!"" quoth he--""full plain I see,"
33144,VII.,"""The devil knows how to row."""
33145,VII.,
33146,VII.,And now all in mine own Countr√©e
33147,VII.,I stood on the firm land!

33150,VII.,
33151,VII.,"""O shrieve me, shrieve me, holy Man!"

33153,VII.,"""Say quick,"" quoth he, ""I bid thee say"

33155,VII.,
33156,VII.,Forthwith this frame of mine was wrench'd
33157,VII.,"With a woeful agony,"
33158,VII.,Which forc'd me to begin my tale
33159,VII.,And then it left me free.
33160,VII.,
33161,VII.,"Since then at an uncertain hour,                                   615"
33162,VII.,"Now oftimes and now fewer,"
33163,VII.,That anguish comes and makes me tell
33164,VII.,My ghastly aventure.
33165,VII.,
33166,VII.,"I pass, like night, from land to land;"
33167,VII.,I have strange power of speech;                                  620
33168,VII.,The moment that his face I see
33169,VII.,I know the man that must hear me;
33170,VII.,To him my tale I teach.
33171,VII.,
33172,VII.,What loud uproar bursts from that door!
33173,VII.,The Wedding-guests are there;                                    625
33174,VII.,But in the Garden-bower the Bride
33175,VII.,And Bride-maids singing are:
33176,VII.,And hark the little Vesper-bell
33177,VII.,Which biddeth me to prayer.
33178,VII.,
33179,VII.,O Wedding-guest! this soul hath been                               630
33180,VII.,Alone on a wide wide sea:
33181,VII.,"So lonely 'twas, that God himself"
33182,VII.,Scarce seemed there to be.
33183,VII.,
33184,VII.,"O sweeter than the Marriage-feast,"
33185,VII.,'Tis sweeter far to me                                           635
33186,VII.,To walk together to the Kirk
33187,VII.,With a goodly company.

33190,VII.,"And all together pray,"
33191,VII.,"While each to his great Father bends,                              640"
33192,VII.,"Old men, and babes, and loving friends,"
33193,VII.,"And Youths, and Maidens gay."
33194,VII.,
33195,VII.,"Farewell, farewell! but this I tell"
33196,VII.,"To thee, thou wedding-guest!"
33197,VII.,"He prayeth well who loveth well,                                   645"
33198,VII.,Both man and bird and beast.
33199,VII.,
33200,VII.,"He prayeth best who loveth best,"
33201,VII.,All things both great and small:
33202,VII.,"For the dear God, who loveth us,"
33203,VII.,He made and loveth all.                                          650
33204,VII.,
33205,VII.,"The Marinere, whose eye is bright,"
33206,VII.,"Whose beard with age is hoar,"
33207,VII.,Is gone; and now the wedding-guest
33208,VII.,Turn'd from the bridegroom's door.
33209,VII.,
33210,VII.,"He went, like one that hath been stunn'd                           655"
33211,VII.,And is of sense forlorn:
33212,VII.,A sadder and a wiser man
33213,VII.,He rose the morrow morn.

33251,THE RAVEN,"[Vide _ante_, p. 169.]"
33252,THE RAVEN,
33253,THE RAVEN,"Under the arms of a goodly oak-tree,"
33254,THE RAVEN,There was of Swine a large company.
33255,THE RAVEN,"They were making a rude repast,"
33256,THE RAVEN,Grunting as they crunch'd the mast.
33257,THE RAVEN,Then they trotted away: for the wind blew high--                     5
33258,THE RAVEN,"One acorn they left, ne more mote you spy."
33259,THE RAVEN,"Next came a Raven, who lik'd not such folly;"
33260,THE RAVEN,"He belong'd, I believe, to the witch MELANCHOLY!"
33261,THE RAVEN,Blacker was he than the blackest jet;
33262,THE RAVEN,Flew low in the rain; his feathers were wet.                        10
33263,THE RAVEN,"He pick'd up the acorn and buried it strait,"
33264,THE RAVEN,By the side of a river both deep and great.
33265,THE RAVEN,Where then did the Raven go?
33266,THE RAVEN,He went high and low--
33267,THE RAVEN,"O'er hill, o'er dale did the black Raven go!                        15"
33268,THE RAVEN,"Many Autumns, many Springs;"
33269,THE RAVEN,Travell'd he with wand'ring wings;
33270,THE RAVEN,"Many Summers, many Winters--"
33271,THE RAVEN,I can't tell half his adventures.
33272,THE RAVEN,"At length he return'd, and with him a she;                          20"
33273,THE RAVEN,And the acorn was grown a large oak-tree.
33274,THE RAVEN,"They built them a nest in the topmost bough,"
33275,THE RAVEN,"And young ones they had, and were jolly enow."
33276,THE RAVEN,But soon came a Woodman in leathern guise:
33277,THE RAVEN,His brow like a pent-house hung over his eyes.                      25
33278,THE RAVEN,"He'd an axe in his hand, and he nothing spoke,"
33279,THE RAVEN,"But with many a hem! and a sturdy stroke,"
33280,THE RAVEN,At last he brought down the poor Raven's own oak.
33281,THE RAVEN,"His young ones were kill'd, for they could not depart,"
33282,THE RAVEN,And his wife she did die of a broken heart!                         30
33283,THE RAVEN,The branches from off it the Woodman did sever!
33284,THE RAVEN,And they floated it down on the course of the River:
33285,THE RAVEN,"They saw'd it to planks, and it's rind they did strip,"
33286,THE RAVEN,And with this tree and others they built up a ship.
33287,THE RAVEN,"The ship, it was launch'd; but in sight of the land,                35"
33288,THE RAVEN,A tempest arose which no ship could withstand.
33289,THE RAVEN,"It bulg'd on a rock, and the waves rush'd in fast--"
33290,THE RAVEN,"The auld Raven flew round and round, and caw'd to the blast."
33291,THE RAVEN,He heard the sea-shriek of their perishing souls--
33292,THE RAVEN,They be sunk! O'er the top-mast the mad water rolls.                40
33293,THE RAVEN,"The Raven was glad that such fate they did meet,"
33294,THE RAVEN,"They had taken his all, and REVENGE WAS SWEET!"

34103,ACT I,"SCENE I. _A cultivated Plain, skirted on the Left by a Wood. The"
34104,ACT I,Pyrenees are visible in the distance. Small knots of Soldiers all in the
34105,ACT I,military Dress of the middle Ages are seen passing across the Stage.
34106,ACT I,Then_
34107,ACT I,
34108,ACT I,"_Enter EARL HENRY and SANDOVAL, both armed._"
34109,ACT I,
34110,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ A delightful plain this, and doubly pleasant"
34111,ACT I,after so long and wearisome a descent from the Pyranees
34112,ACT I,[_sic_]. Did you not observe how our poor over wearied horses
34113,ACT I,mended their pace as soon as they reached it?
34114,ACT I,
34115,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ I must entreat your forgiveness, gallant               5"
34116,ACT I,Castilian! I ought ere this to have bade you welcome to my
34117,ACT I,native Navarre.
34118,ACT I,
34119,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ Cheerily, General! Navarre has indeed but ill"
34120,ACT I,"repaid your services, in thus recalling you from the head of"
34121,ACT I,an army which you yourself had collected and disciplined.           10
34122,ACT I,But the wrongs and insults which you have suffered----
34123,ACT I,
34124,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ Deserve my thanks, Friend! In the sunshine"
34125,ACT I,of Court-favor I could only _believe_ that I loved my Queen and
34126,ACT I,my Country: now I _know_ it. But why name I my Country or
34127,ACT I,my Sovereign? I owe all my Wrongs to the private enmity of          15
34128,ACT I,the Chancellor.
34129,ACT I,
34130,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ Heaven be praised, you have atchieved [_sic_]"
34131,ACT I,a delicious revenge upon him!--that the same Courier who
34132,ACT I,brought the orders for your recall carried back with him the
34133,ACT I,first tidings of your Victory--it was exquisite good fortune!       20
34134,ACT I,
34135,ACT I,_Earl Henry._ Sandoval! my gallant Friend! Let me not
34136,ACT I,deceive you. To you I have vowed an undisguised openness.
34137,ACT I,"The gloom which overcast me, was occasioned by causes of less"
34138,ACT I,public import.
34139,ACT I,
34140,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ Connected, I presume, with that Mansion, the            25"
34141,ACT I,spacious pleasure grounds of which we noticed as we were
34142,ACT I,"descending from the mountain. Lawn and Grove, River and"
34143,ACT I,"Hillock--it looked within these high walls, like a World of"
34144,ACT I,itself.
34145,ACT I,
34146,ACT I,_Earl Henry._ This Wood scarcely conceals these high walls          30
34147,ACT I,"from us. Alas! I know the place too well. . . . Nay, why too"
34148,ACT I,"well?--But wherefore spake you, Sandoval, of this Mansion?"
34149,ACT I,What know you?
34150,ACT I,
34151,ACT I,_Sandoval._ Nothing. Therefore I spake of it. On our descent
34152,ACT I,from the mountain I pointed it out to you and asked to whom         35
34153,ACT I,"it belonged--you became suddenly absent, and answered me"
34154,ACT I,only by looks of Disturbance and Anxiety.
34155,ACT I,
34156,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ That Mansion once belonged to Manric [_sic_],"
34157,ACT I,Lord of Valdez.
34158,ACT I,
34159,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ Alas, poor Man! the same, who had dangerous             40"
34160,ACT I,claims to the Throne of Navarre.
34161,ACT I,
34162,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ Claims?--Say rather, pretensions--plausible"
34163,ACT I,only to the unreasoning Multitude.
34164,ACT I,
34165,ACT I,_Sandoval._ Pretensions then (_with bitterness_).
34166,ACT I,
34167,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ Bad as these were, the means he employed to           45"
34168,ACT I,give effect to them were still worse. He trafficked with France
34169,ACT I,"against the independence of his Country. He was a traitor,"
34170,ACT I,my Friend! and died a traitor's death. His two sons suffered
34171,ACT I,"with him, and many, (I fear, too many) of his adherents."
34172,ACT I,
34173,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ Earl Henry! (_a pause_) If the sentence were just,      50"
34174,ACT I,"why was not the execution of it public. . . . It is reported, that"
34175,ACT I,they were--but no! I will not believe it--the honest soul of
34176,ACT I,my friend would not justify so foul a deed.
34177,ACT I,
34178,ACT I,_Earl Henry._ Speak plainly--what is reported?
34179,ACT I,
34180,ACT I,_Sandoval._ That they were all assassinated by order of the         55
34181,ACT I,new Queen.
34182,ACT I,
34183,ACT I,_Earl Henry._ Accursed be the hearts that framed and
34184,ACT I,the tongues that scattered the Calumny!--The Queen was
34185,ACT I,"scarcely seated on her throne; the Chancellor, who had been"
34186,ACT I,"her Guardian, exerted a pernicious influence over her               60"
34187,ACT I,judgement--she was taught to fear dangerous commotions in the
34188,ACT I,"Capital, she was intreated to prevent the bloodshed of the"
34189,ACT I,"deluded citizens, and thus overawed she reluctantly consented"
34190,ACT I,"to permit the reinforcement of an obsolete law, and----"
34191,ACT I,
34192,ACT I,_Sandoval._ They were not assassinated then?----                    65
34193,ACT I,
34194,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ Why these bitter tones to me, Sandoval? Can"
34195,ACT I,a law assassinate? Don Manrique [_sic_] and his accomplices
34196,ACT I,drank the sleepy poison adjudged by that law in the State
34197,ACT I,Prison at Pampilona. At that time I was with the army on
34198,ACT I,the frontiers of France.                                            70
34199,ACT I,
34200,ACT I,_Sandoval._ Had you been in the Capital----
34201,ACT I,
34202,ACT I,_Earl Henry._ I would have pledged my life on the safety of
34203,ACT I,a public Trial and a public Punishment.
34204,ACT I,
34205,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ Poisoned! The Father and his Sons!--And this,"
34206,ACT I,"Earl Henry, was the first act of that Queen, whom you idolize!      75"
34207,ACT I,
34208,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ No, Sandoval, No! This was not _her_ act. She"
34209,ACT I,"roused herself from the stupor of alarm, she suspended _in"
34210,ACT I,"opposition to the advice of her council_, all proceedings against"
34211,ACT I,the inferior partisans of the Conspiracy; she facilitated the
34212,ACT I,"escape of Don Manrique's brother, and to Donna Oropeza, his         80"
34213,ACT I,"daughter and only surviving child, she restored all her father's"
34214,ACT I,"possessions, nay became herself her Protectress and Friend."
34215,ACT I,"These were the acts, these the first acts of my royal Mistress."
34216,ACT I,
34217,ACT I,_Sandoval._ And how did Donna Oropeza receive these favors?
34218,ACT I,
34219,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ Why ask you that? Did they not fall on her,           85"
34220,ACT I,like heavenly dews?
34221,ACT I,
34222,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ And will they not rise again, like an earthly mist?"
34223,ACT I,"What is Gratitude opposed to Ambition, filial revenge, and"
34224,ACT I,Woman's rivalry--what is it but a cruel Curb in the mouth of
34225,ACT I,"a fiery Horse, maddening the fierce animal whom it cannot           90"
34226,ACT I,"restrain? Forgive me, Earl Henry! I meant not to move"
34227,ACT I,you so deeply.
34228,ACT I,
34229,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ Sandoval, you have uttered that in a waking"
34230,ACT I,"hour which having once dreamt, I feared the return of sleep"
34231,ACT I,lest I should dream it over again. My Friend (_his Voice            95
34232,ACT I,"trembling_) I woo'd the daughter of Don Manrique, _but_ we are"
34233,ACT I,interrupted.
34234,ACT I,
34235,ACT I,_Sandoval._ It is Fernandez.
34236,ACT I,
34237,ACT I,_Earl Henry (struggling with his emotions)._ A true-hearted old
34238,ACT I,fellow----                                                         100
34239,ACT I,
34240,ACT I,_Sandoval._ As splenetic as he is brave.
34241,ACT I,
34242,ACT I,_Enter_ FERNANDEZ.
34243,ACT I,
34244,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ Well, my ancient! how did you like our tour"
34245,ACT I,through the mountains. (_EARL HENRY sits down on the seat by
34246,ACT I,the woodside._)
34247,ACT I,
34248,ACT I,"_Fernandez._ But little, General! and my faithful charger          105"
34249,ACT I,Liked it still less.
34250,ACT I,The field of battle in the level plain
34251,ACT I,By Fontarabia was more to our taste.
34252,ACT I,
34253,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ Where is my brother, Don Curio! Have you"
34254,ACT I,Seen him of late?
34255,ACT I,
34256,ACT I,"_Fernandez._      Scarcely, dear General!                          110"
34257,ACT I,For by my troth I have been laughing at him
34258,ACT I,Even till the merry tears so filled my eyes
34259,ACT I,That I lost sight of him.
34260,ACT I,
34261,ACT I,"_Sandoval._               But wherefore, Captain."
34262,ACT I,
34263,ACT I,_Fernandez._ He hath been studying speeches with fierce gestures;
34264,ACT I,"Speeches brimfull of wrath and indignation,                        115"
34265,ACT I,The which he hopes to vent in open council:
34266,ACT I,"And, in the heat and fury of this fancy"
34267,ACT I,He grasp'd your groom of the Chamber by the throat
34268,ACT I,"Who squeaking piteously, Ey! quoth your brother,"
34269,ACT I,"I cry you Mercy, Fool! Hadst been indeed                           120"
34270,ACT I,"The Chancellor, I should have strangled thee."
34271,ACT I,
34272,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ Ha, ha! poor Barnard!"
34273,ACT I,
34274,ACT I,"_Fernandez._                      What you know my Gentleman,"
34275,ACT I,"My Groom of the Chamber, my Sieur Barnard, hey?"
34276,ACT I,
34277,ACT I,_Sandoval._ I know him for a barren-pated coxcomb.
34278,ACT I,
34279,ACT I,"_Fernandez._ But very weedy, Sir! in worthless phrases,            125"
34280,ACT I,A sedulous eschewer of the popular
34281,ACT I,And the colloquial--one who seeketh dignity
34282,ACT I,I' th' paths of circumlocution! It would have
34283,ACT I,"Surpris'd you tho', to hear how nat'rally"
34284,ACT I,He squeak'd when Curio had him by the throat.                      130
34285,ACT I,
34286,ACT I,_Sandoval._ I know him too for an habitual scorner
34287,ACT I,Of Truth.
34288,ACT I,
34289,ACT I,_Fernandez._ And one that lies more dully than
34290,ACT I,"Old Women dream, without pretence of fancy,"
34291,ACT I,"Humour or mirth, a most disinterested,"
34292,ACT I,Gratuitous Liar.
34293,ACT I,
34294,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._    Ho! enough, enough!                               135"
34295,ACT I,"Spare him, I pray you, were't but from respect"
34296,ACT I,To the presence of his Lord.
34297,ACT I,
34298,ACT I,_Sandoval._                  I stand reprov'd.
34299,ACT I,
34300,ACT I,"_Fernandez._ I too, but that I know our noble General"
34301,ACT I,"Maintains him near his person, only that"
34302,ACT I,If he should ever go in jeopardy                                   140
34303,ACT I,Of being damn'd (as he's now persecuted)
34304,ACT I,"For his virtue and fair sense, he may be sav'd"
34305,ACT I,By the supererogation of this Fellow's
34306,ACT I,Folly and Worthlessness.----
34307,ACT I,
34308,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._                Hold, hold, good Ancient!"
34309,ACT I,Do you not know that this Barnard saved my life?                   145
34310,ACT I,"Well, but my brother----"
34311,ACT I,
34312,ACT I,_Fernandez._             He will soon be here.
34313,ACT I,"I swear by this, my sword, dear General."
34314,ACT I,I swear he has a Hero's soul--I only
34315,ACT I,Wish I could communicate to him
34316,ACT I,My gift of governing the spleen.--Then he                          150
34317,ACT I,"Has had his colors, the drums too of the Regiment"
34318,ACT I,"All put in cases--O, that stirs the Soldiery."
34319,ACT I,
34320,ACT I,_Earl Henry._ Impetuous Boy!
34321,ACT I,
34322,ACT I,"_Fernandez._                 Nay, Fear not for them, General."
34323,ACT I,"The Chancellor, no doubt, will take good care"
34324,ACT I,To let their blood grow cool on garrison duty.                     155
34325,ACT I,
34326,ACT I,_Sandoval._ Earl Henry! Frown not thus upon Fernandez;
34327,ACT I,"'Tis said, and all the Soldiery believe it,"
34328,ACT I,That the five Regiments who return with you
34329,ACT I,"Will be dispers'd in garrisons and castles,"
34330,ACT I,And other Jails of honourable name.                                160
34331,ACT I,So great a crime it is to have been present
34332,ACT I,In duty and devotion to a Hero!
34333,ACT I,
34334,ACT I,_Fernandez._ What now? What now? The politic Chancellor is
34335,ACT I,"The Soldier's friend, and rather than not give"
34336,ACT I,"Snug pensions to brave Men, he'll overlook                         165"
34337,ACT I,All small disqualifying circumstances
34338,ACT I,"Of youth and health, keen eye and muscular limb,"
34339,ACT I,"He'll count our scars, and set them down for maims."
34340,ACT I,And gain us thus all privileges and profits
34341,ACT I,Of Invalids and superannuate veterans.                             170
34342,ACT I,
34343,ACT I,_Earl Henry._ 'Tis but an idle rumour--See! they come.
34344,ACT I,
34345,ACT I,"_Enter_ BARNARD _and a number of_ Soldiers, _their Colours wound up, and"
34346,ACT I,"the Drums in Cases, and after them_ DON CURIO. _All pay the military"
34347,ACT I,Honors to the General. During this time_ FERNANDEZ _has hurried up in
34348,ACT I,front of the Stage_.
34349,ACT I,
34350,ACT I,_Enter DON CURIO._
34351,ACT I,
34352,ACT I,_Don Curio (advancing to EARL HENRY)._ Has Barnard told you?
34353,ACT I,"Insult on insult! by mine honor, Brother!"
34354,ACT I,(_BARNARD goes beside CURIO._) And by our Father's soul they mean
34355,ACT I,"to saint you,"
34356,ACT I,Having first prov'd your Patience more than mortal.                175
34357,ACT I,
34358,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._ Take heed, Don Curio! lest with greater right"
34359,ACT I,They scoff my Brother for a choleric boy.
34360,ACT I,What insult then?
34361,ACT I,
34362,ACT I,"_Don Curio._      Our Friend, the Chancellor,"
34363,ACT I,"Welcomes you home, and shares the common joy"
34364,ACT I,In the most happy tidings of your Victory:                         180
34365,ACT I,But as to your demand of instant audience
34366,ACT I,"From the Queen's Royal Person,--'tis rejected!"
34367,ACT I,
34368,ACT I,_Sandoval._ Rejected?
34369,ACT I,
34370,ACT I,_Barnard (making a deep obeisance)._ May it please the Earl!
34371,ACT I,
34372,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._                                                Speak,"
34373,ACT I,Barnard.
34374,ACT I,
34375,ACT I,"_Barnard._ The noble Youth, your very valiant brother,"
34376,ACT I,And wise as valiant (_bowing to DON CURIO who puffs at him_)
34377,ACT I,rightly doth insinuate                                         185
34378,ACT I,Fortune deals nothing singly--whether Honors
34379,ACT I,"Or Insults, whether it be Joys or Sorrows,"
34380,ACT I,"They crowd together on us, or at best"
34381,ACT I,Drop in in quick succession.
34382,ACT I,
34383,ACT I,"_Fernandez (mocking him)._ 'Ne'er rains it, but it pours,' or, at"
34384,ACT I,"the best,                                                      190"
34385,ACT I,'More sacks upon the mill.' This fellow's a
34386,ACT I,"Perpetual plagiarist from his Grandmother, and"
34387,ACT I,How slily in the parcel wraps [he] up
34388,ACT I,The stolen goods!
34389,ACT I,
34390,ACT I,"_Earl Henry._     Be somewhat briefer, Barnard."
34391,ACT I,
34392,ACT I,_Barnard._ But could I dare insinuate to your Brother              195
34393,ACT I,"A fearless Truth, Earl Henry--it were this:"
34394,ACT I,"Even Lucifer, Prince of the Air, hath claims"
34395,ACT I,Upon our justice.
34396,ACT I,
34397,ACT I,_Fernandez._      Give the Devil his Due!
34398,ACT I,"Why, thou base Lacquerer of worm-eaten proverbs,"
34399,ACT I,[And] wherefore dost thou not tell us at once                      200
34400,ACT I,What the Chancellor said to thee?
34401,ACT I,
34402,ACT I,_Barnard_ (_looking round superciliously at_ FERNANDEZ).
34403,ACT I,The Queen hath left the Capital affecting
34404,ACT I,"Rural retirement, but 'I will hasten'"
34405,ACT I,(Thus said the Chancellor) 'I myself will hasten
34406,ACT I,And lay before her Majesty the Tidings                             205

34408,ACT I,"She will vouchsafe, I doubt not, to re-enter"

34411,ACT I,
34412,ACT I,"_Don Curio._ A mere Device, I say, to pass a slight on us.         210"
34413,ACT I,
34414,ACT I,"_Fernandez (to himself)._ To think on't. Pshaw! A fellow, that must"
34415,ACT I,needs
34416,ACT I,"Have been decreed an Ass by acclamation,"

34418,ACT I,"And he to---- (_turns suddenly round, and faces BARNARD who had"

34428,ACT I,
34429,ACT I,_Fernandez._ Was he asleep? And were the hunters coming

34486,ACT I,sav'd from bursting
34487,ACT I,"The swelling heart of one, whose Cup of Hope"

34489,ACT I,"Permitted just to see the face of War,"
34490,ACT I,"Then like a truant boy, scourgd home again"
34491,ACT I,One Field my whole Campaign! One glorious Battle

34513,ACT I,

34515,ACT I,I am too full of dreams to meet her now.
34516,ACT I,
34517,ACT I,_Sandoval._ You lov'd the daughter of Don Manrique?
34518,ACT I,
34519,ACT I,_Earl Henry._                                       Loved?

34528,ACT I,
34529,ACT I,_Earl Henry._           O I were most base
34530,ACT I,"Not loving Oropeza. True, I woo'd her"
34531,ACT I,Hoping to heal a deeper wound: but she
34532,ACT I,Met my advances with an empassion'd Pride
34533,ACT I,That kindled Love with Love. And when her Sire                     270
34534,ACT I,Who in his dream of Hope already grasp'd
34535,ACT I,"The golden circlet in his hand, rejected"
34536,ACT I,"My suit, with Insult, and in memory"
34537,ACT I,"Of ancient Feuds, pour'd Curses on my head,"
34538,ACT I,Her Blessings overtook and baffled them.                           275
34539,ACT I,"But thou art stern, and with unkindling Countenance"
34540,ACT I,Art inly reasoning whilst thou listenest to me.
34541,ACT I,
34542,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ Anxiously, Henry! reasoning anxiously."
34543,ACT I,But Oropeza--
34544,ACT I,
34545,ACT I,_Earl Henry._ Blessings gather round her!
34546,ACT I,"Within this wood there winds a secret passage,                     280"
34547,ACT I,"Beneath the walls, which open out at length"
34548,ACT I,Into the gloomiest covert of the Garden.--
34549,ACT I,"The night ere my departure to the Army,"
34550,ACT I,"She, nothing trembling, led me through that gloom,"
34551,ACT I,"And to the covert by a silent stream,                              285"
34552,ACT I,"Which, with one star reflected near its marge,"
34553,ACT I,Was the sole object visible around me.
34554,ACT I,"The night so dark, so close, the umbrage o'er us!"
34555,ACT I,"No leaflet stirr'd;--yet pleasure hung upon us,"
34556,ACT I,The gloom and stillness of the balmy night-air.                    290
34557,ACT I,"A little further on an arbor stood,"
34558,ACT I,Fragrant with flowering Trees--I well remember
34559,ACT I,What an uncertain glimmer in the Darkness
34560,ACT I,"Their snow-white Blossoms made--thither she led me,"
34561,ACT I,To that sweet bower! Then Oropeza trembled--                       295
34562,ACT I,I heard her heart beat--if 'twere not my own.
34563,ACT I,
34564,ACT I,"_Sandoval._ A rude and searing note, my friend!"
34565,ACT I,
34566,ACT I,_Earl Henry._                                   Oh! no!
34567,ACT I,I have small memory of aught but pleasure.
34568,ACT I,"The inquietudes of fear, like lesser Streams"
34569,ACT I,"Still flowing, still were lost in those of Love:                   300"
34570,ACT I,"So Love grew mightier from the Pear, and Nature,"
34571,ACT I,"Fleeing from Pain, shelter'd herself in Joy."
34572,ACT I,"The stars above our heads were dim and steady,"
34573,ACT I,Like eyes suffus'd with rapture. Life was in us:
34574,ACT I,"We were all life, each atom of our Frames                          305"
34575,ACT I,A living soul--I vow'd to die for her:
34576,ACT I,"With the faint voice of one who, having spoken,"
34577,ACT I,"Relapses into blessedness, I vow'd it:"
34578,ACT I,"That solemn Vow, a whisper scarcely heard,"
34579,ACT I,A murmur breath'd against a lady's Cheek.                          310
34580,ACT I,"Oh! there is Joy above the name of Pleasure,"
34581,ACT I,"Deep self-possession, an intense Repose."
34582,ACT I,"No other than as Eastern Sages feign,"
34583,ACT I,"The God, who floats upon a Lotos Leaf,"
34584,ACT I,"Dreams for a thousand ages; then awaking,                          315"
34585,ACT I,"Creates a world, and smiling at the bubble,"
34586,ACT I,Relapses into bliss. Ah! was that bliss
34587,ACT I,"Fear'd as an alien, and too vast for man?"
34588,ACT I,"For suddenly, intolerant of its silence,"
34589,ACT I,"Did Oropeza, starting, grasp my forehead.                          320"
34590,ACT I,I caught her arms; the veins were swelling on them.
34591,ACT I,Thro' the dark Bower she sent a hollow voice;--
34592,ACT I,'Oh! what if all betray me? what if thou?'
34593,ACT I,"I swore, and with an inward thought that seemed"
34594,ACT I,"The unity and substance of my Being,                               325"
34595,ACT I,"I swore to her, that were she red with guilt,"
34596,ACT I,I would exchange my unblench'd state with hers.--
34597,ACT I,"Friend! by that winding passage, to the Bower"
34598,ACT I,I now will go--all objects there will teach me
34599,ACT I,"Unwavering Love, and singleness of Heart.                          330"
34600,ACT I,"Go, Sandoval! I am prepar'd to meet her--"
34601,ACT I,Say nothing of me--I myself will seek her--
34602,ACT I,"Nay, leave me, friend! I cannot bear the torment"
34603,ACT I,And Inquisition of that scanning eye.--
34604,ACT I,
34605,ACT I,[_Earl Henry retires into the wood._
34606,ACT I,
34607,ACT I,_Sandoval (alone)._ O Henry! always striv'st thou to be great      335
34608,ACT I,By thine own act--yet art thou never great
34609,ACT I,But by the Inspiration of great Passion.
34610,ACT I,"The Whirl-blast comes, the desert-sands rise up"
34611,ACT I,"And shape themselves; from Heaven to Earth they stand,"
34612,ACT I,"As though they were the Pillars of a Temple,                       340"
34613,ACT I,Built by Omnipotence in its own honour!
34614,ACT I,"But the Blast pauses, and their shaping spirit"
34615,ACT I,"Is fled: the mighty Columns were but sand,"
34616,ACT I,And lazy Snakes trail o'er the level ruins!
34617,ACT I,"I know, he loves the Queen. I know she is                          345"
34618,ACT I,"His Soul's first love, and this is ever his nature--"
34619,ACT I,"To his first purpose, his soul toiling back"
34620,ACT I,"Like the poor storm-wreck'd [sailor] to his Boat,"

34784,A HYMN,
34785,A HYMN,
34786,A HYMN,Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star
34787,A HYMN,In his steep course--so long he seems to pause
34788,A HYMN,"On thy bald awful head, O Chamouny!"
34789,A HYMN,The Arv√® and Arveiron at thy base
34790,A HYMN,"Eave ceaselessly; but thou, dread mountain form,                     5"
34791,A HYMN,Resist from forth thy silent sea of pines
34792,A HYMN,"How silently! Around thee, and above,"
34793,A HYMN,"Deep is the sky, and black: transpicuous, deep,"
34794,A HYMN,An ebon mass! Methinks thou piercest it
34795,A HYMN,"As with a wedge! But when I look again,                             10"
34796,A HYMN,"It seems thy own calm home, thy crystal shrine,"
34797,A HYMN,Thy habitation from eternity.
34798,A HYMN,"O dread and silent form! I gaz'd upon thee,"
34799,A HYMN,"Till thou, still present to my bodily eye,"
34800,A HYMN,"Did'st vanish from my thought. Entranc'd in pray'r,                 15"
34801,A HYMN,I worshipp'd the INVISIBLE alone.
34802,A HYMN,"Yet thou, meantime, wast working on my soul,"
34803,A HYMN,"E'en like some deep enchanting melody,"
34804,A HYMN,"So sweet, we know not, we are list'ning to it."
34805,A HYMN,"But I awoke, and with a busier mind,                                20"
34806,A HYMN,"And active will self-conscious, offer now"
34807,A HYMN,"Not, as before, involuntary pray'r"
34808,A HYMN,And passive adoration!--
34809,A HYMN,"Hand and voice,"
34810,A HYMN,"Awake, awake! and thou, my heart, awake!"

34812,A HYMN,"Green fields, and icy cliffs! All join my hymn!"
34813,A HYMN,"And thou, O silent mountain, sole and bare,"
34814,A HYMN,"O blacker, than the darkness, all the night,"
34815,A HYMN,"And visited, all night, by troops of stars,"
34816,A HYMN,"Or when they climb the sky, or when they sink--                     30"
34817,A HYMN,"Companion of the morning star at dawn,"

34822,A HYMN,Who made thee father of perpetual streams?
34823,A HYMN,"And you, ye five wild torrents, fiercely glad,"
34824,A HYMN,Who call'd you forth from Night and utter Death?
34825,A HYMN,"From darkness let you loose, and icy dens,"
34826,A HYMN,"Down those precipitous, black, jagged rocks                         40"
34827,A HYMN,"For ever shatter'd, and the same for ever!"

34830,A HYMN,"Unceasing thunder, and eternal foam!"
34831,A HYMN,"And who commanded, and the silence came--                           45"
34832,A HYMN,"'Here shall the billows stiffen, and have rest?'"

34834,A HYMN,Ye ice-falls! ye that from yon dizzy heights
34835,A HYMN,"Adown enormous ravines steeply slope,"
34836,A HYMN,"Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,"
34837,A HYMN,And stopp'd at once amid their maddest plunge!                      50
34838,A HYMN,Motionless torrents! silent cataracts!
34839,A HYMN,"Who made you glorious, as the gates of Heav'n,"
34840,A HYMN,Beneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun
34841,A HYMN,Clothe you with rainbows? Who with lovely flow'rs
34842,A HYMN,Of living blue spread garlands at your feet?                        55
34843,A HYMN,"GOD! GOD! The torrents like a shout of nations,"
34844,A HYMN,"Utter! The ice-plain bursts, and answers GOD!"
34845,A HYMN,"GOD, sing the meadow-streams with gladsome voice,"
34846,A HYMN,"And pine groves with their soft, and soul-like sound,"
34847,A HYMN,"The silent snow-mass, loos'ning, thunders GOD!                      60"
34848,A HYMN,Ye dreadless flow'rs! that fringe th' eternal frost!
34849,A HYMN,"Ye wild goats, bounding by the eagle's nest!"
34850,A HYMN,"Ye eagles, playmates of the mountain blast!"
34851,A HYMN,"Ye lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds!"
34852,A HYMN,"Ye signs and wonders of the element,                                65"
34853,A HYMN,"Utter forth, GOD! and fill the hills with praise!"
34854,A HYMN,
34855,A HYMN,"And thou, O silent Form, alone and bare,"
34856,A HYMN,"Whom, as I lift again my head bow'd low"
34857,A HYMN,"In adoration, I again behold,"
34858,A HYMN,And to thy summit upward from thy base                              70

34979,IV,"Save to the pure, and in their purest hour,"

34990,IV,"Yes, dearest EDMUND, yes!"
34991,IV,"There was a time that, tho' my path was rough,"
34992,IV,"This joy within me dallied with distress,"
34993,IV,And all misfortunes were but as the stuff
34994,IV,Whence fancy made me dreams of happiness:                         80
34995,IV,"For hope grew round me, like the twining vine,"
34996,IV,"And fruits, and foliage, not my own, seem'd mine."

34998,IV,"Nor care I, that they rob me of my mirth,"

35031,VIII,"At once they groan with pain, and shudder with the cold!"

35034,VIII,"With groans, and tremulous shudderings--all is over!               110"
35035,VIII,"It tells another tale, with sounds less deep and loud--"

35703,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"A feeling of sadness, a peculiar melancholy, is wont to take"
35704,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],possession of me alike in Spring and in Autumn. But in Spring
35705,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],it is the melancholy of Hope: in Autumn it is the melancholy
35706,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],of Resignation. As I was journeying on foot through the
35707,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"Appennine, I fell in with a pilgrim in whom the Spring and           5"
35708,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],the Autumn and the Melancholy of both seemed to have
35709,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],combined. In his discourse there were the freshness and the
35710,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],colours of April:
35711,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35712,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"Qual ramicel a ramo,"
35713,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],Tal da pensier pensiero                                        10

35716,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"But as I gazed on his whole form and figure, I bethought me"
35717,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"of the not unlovely decays, both of age and of the late season,"
35718,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"in the stately elm, after the clusters have been plucked from"
35719,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"its entwining vines, and the vines are as bands of dried withies    15"
35720,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],around its trunk and branches. Even so there was a memory
35721,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"on his smooth and ample forehead, which blended with the"
35722,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"dedication of his steady eyes, that still looked--I know not,"
35723,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"whether upward, or far onward, or rather to the line of meeting"
35724,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],where the sky rests upon the distance. But how may I express        20
35725,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],that dimness of abstraction which lay on the lustre of the
35726,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],pilgrim's eyes like the flitting tarnish from the breath of a sigh
35727,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],on a silver mirror! and which accorded with their slow and
35728,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"reluctant movement, whenever he turned them to any object"
35729,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"on the right hand or on the left? It seemed, methought, as          25"
35730,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],if there lay upon the brightness a shadowy presence of
35731,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"disappointments now unfelt, but never forgotten. It was at once"
35732,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],the melancholy of hope and of resignation.
35733,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35734,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"We had not long been fellow-travellers, ere a sudden tempest"
35735,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],of wind and rain forced us to seek protection in the vaulted        30
35736,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],door-way of a lone chapelry; and we sate face to face each on
35737,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"the stone bench alongside the low, weather-stained wall, and"
35738,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],as close as possible to the massy door.
35739,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35740,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"After a pause of silence: even thus, said he, like two strangers"
35741,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"that have fled to the same shelter from the same storm, not         35"
35742,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],seldom do Despair and Hope meet for the first time in the
35743,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"porch of Death! All extremes meet, I answered; but yours"
35744,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],was a strange and visionary thought. The better then doth it
35745,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"beseem both the place and me, he replied. From a Visionary"
35746,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],wilt thou hear a Vision? Mark that vivid flash through this         40
35747,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],torrent of rain! Fire and water. Even here thy adage holds
35748,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"true, and its truth is the moral of my Vision. I entreated him"
35749,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],to proceed. Sloping his face toward the arch and yet averting
35750,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"his eye from it, he seemed to seek and prepare his words: till"
35751,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"listening to the wind that echoed within the hollow edifice,        45"
35752,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"and to the rain without,"
35753,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35754,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"Which stole on his thoughts with its two-fold sound,"
35755,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"The clash hard by and the murmur all round,[1092:1]"
35756,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35757,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"he gradually sank away, alike from me and from his own purpose,"
35758,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],and amid the gloom of the storm and in the duskiness of that        50
35759,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"place, he sate like an emblem on a rich man's sepulchre, or like a"
35760,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"mourner on the sodded grave of an only one--an aged mourner,"
35761,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],who is watching the waned moon and sorroweth not. Starting
35762,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"at length from his brief trance of abstraction, with courtesy and"
35763,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"an atoning smile he renewed his discourse, and commenced his        55"
35764,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],parable.
35765,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35766,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],During one of those short furloughs from the service of the
35767,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"body, which the soul may sometimes obtain even in this its"
35768,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"militant state, I found myself in a vast plain, which I"
35769,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],immediately knew to be the Valley of Life. It possessed an          60
35770,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"astonishing diversity of soils: here was a sunny spot, and"
35771,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"there a dark one, forming just such a mixture of sunshine and"
35772,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"shade, as we may have observed on the mountains' side in an"
35773,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"April day, when the thin broken clouds are scattered over"
35774,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],heaven. Almost in the very entrance of the valley stood             65
35775,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"a large and gloomy pile, into which I seemed constrained to"
35776,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],enter. Every part of the building was crowded with tawdry
35777,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],ornaments and fantastic deformity. On every window was
35778,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"portrayed, in glaring and inelegant colours, some horrible tale,"
35779,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"or preternatural incident, so that not a ray of light could enter,  70"
35780,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],untinged by the medium through which it passed. The body
35781,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"of the building was full of people, some of them dancing, in and"
35782,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"out, in unintelligible figures, with strange ceremonies and antic"
35783,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"merriment, while others seemed convulsed with horror, or"
35784,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"pining in mad melancholy. Intermingled with these, I observed       75"
35785,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"a number of men, clothed in ceremonial robes, who appeared"
35786,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"now to marshal the various groups, and to direct their"
35787,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"movements; and now with menacing countenances, to drag some"
35788,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"reluctant victim to a vast idol, framed of iron bars intercrossed,"
35789,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"which formed at the same time an immense cage, and the shape        80"
35790,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],of a human Colossus.
35791,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35792,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],I stood for a while lost in wonder what these things might
35793,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"mean; when lo! one of the directors came up to me, and with"
35794,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"a stern and reproachful look bade me uncover my head, for"
35795,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],that the place into which I had entered was the temple of           85
35796,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"the only true Religion, in the holier recesses of which the"
35797,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],great Goddess personally resided. Himself too he bade me
35798,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"reverence, as the consecrated minister of her rites. Awestruck"
35799,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"by the name of Religion, I bowed before the priest, and humbly"
35800,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],and earnestly intreated him to conduct me into her presence.        90
35801,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"He assented. Offerings he took from me, with mystic"
35802,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"sprinklings of water and with salt he purified, and with strange"
35803,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],sufflations he exorcised me; and then led me through many
35804,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"a dark and winding alley, the dew-damps of which chilled my"
35805,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"flesh, and the hollow echoes under my feet, mingled, methought,     95"
35806,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"with moanings, affrighted me. At length we entered a large"
35807,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"hall, without window, or spiracle, or lamp. The asylum and"
35808,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],dormitory it seemed of perennial night--only that the walls were
35809,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],brought to the eye by a number of self-luminous inscriptions in
35810,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"letters of a pale sepulchral light, which held strange neutrality  100"
35811,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"with the darkness, on the verge of which it kept its rayless vigil."
35812,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"I could read them, methought; but though each of the words"
35813,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"taken separately I seemed to understand, yet when I took them"
35814,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"in sentences, they were riddles and incomprehensible. As I"
35815,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"stood meditating on these hard sayings, my guide thus addressed    105"
35816,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],me--'Read and believe: these are mysteries!'--At the
35817,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"extremity of the vast hall the Goddess was placed. Her features,"
35818,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"blended with darkness, rose out to my view, terrible, yet vacant."
35819,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"I prostrated myself before her, and then retired with my guide,"
35820,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"soul-withered, and wondering, and dissatisfied.                    110"
35821,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35822,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],As I re-entered the body of the temple I heard a deep buzz
35823,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"as of discontent. A few whose eyes were bright, and either"
35824,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"piercing or steady, and whose ample foreheads, with the weighty"
35825,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"bar, ridge-like, above the eyebrows, bespoke observation followed"
35826,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"by meditative thought; and a much larger number, who were          115"
35827,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],enraged by the severity and insolence of the priests in exacting
35828,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"their offerings, had collected in one tumultuous group, and with"
35829,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],a confused outcry of 'This is the Temple of Superstition!' after
35830,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"much contumely, and turmoil, and cruel maltreatment on all"
35831,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"sides, rushed out of the pile: and I, methought, joined them.      120"
35832,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35833,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"We speeded from the Temple with hasty steps, and had now"
35834,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"nearly gone round half the valley, when we were addressed by"
35835,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"a woman, tall beyond the stature of mortals, and with a"
35836,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"something more than human in her countenance and mien, which"
35837,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"yet could by mortals be only felt, not conveyed by words or        125"
35838,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"intelligibly distinguished. Deep reflection, animated by ardent"
35839,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"feelings, was displayed in them: and hope, without its"
35840,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"uncertainty, and a something more than all these, which I understood"
35841,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"not, but which yet seemed to blend all these into a divine unity"
35842,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"of expression. Her garments were white and matronly, and of        130"
35843,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"the simplest texture. We inquired her name. 'My name,'"
35844,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"she replied, 'is Religion.'"
35845,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35846,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"The more numerous part of our company, affrighted by the"
35847,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"very sound, and sore from recent impostures or sorceries,"
35848,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"hurried onwards and examined no farther. A few of us, struck       135"
35849,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],by the manifest opposition of her form and manners to those
35850,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"of the living Idol, whom we had so recently abjured, agreed to"
35851,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"follow her, though with cautious circumspection. She led us to"
35852,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"an eminence in the midst of the valley, from the top of which"
35853,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"we could command the whole plain, and observe the relation of      140"
35854,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"the different parts to each other, and of each to the whole, and"
35855,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],of all to each. She then gave us an optic glass which assisted
35856,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"without contradicting our natural vision, and enabled us to see"
35857,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],far beyond the limits of the Valley of Life; though our eye
35858,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],even thus assisted permitted us only to behold a light and         145
35859,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"a glory, but what we could not descry, save only that it was,"
35860,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],and that it was most glorious.
35861,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35862,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"And now with the rapid transition of a dream, I had overtaken"
35863,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"and rejoined the more numerous party, who had abruptly"
35864,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"left us, indignant at the very name of religion. They journied     150"
35865,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"on, goading each other with remembrances of past oppressions,"
35866,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"and never looking back, till in the eagerness to recede from the"
35867,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],Temple of Superstition they had rounded the whole circle of the
35868,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"valley. And lo! there faced us the mouth of a vast cavern, at"
35869,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"the base of a lofty and almost perpendicular rock, the interior    155"
35870,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"side of which, unknown to them and unsuspected, formed the"
35871,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],extreme and backward wall of the Temple. An impatient
35872,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"crowd, we entered the vast and dusky cave, which was the only"
35873,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],perforation of the precipice. At the mouth of the cave sate
35874,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"two figures; the first, by her dress and gestures, I knew to be    160"
35875,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"Sensuality; the second form, from the fierceness of his demeanour,"
35876,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"and the brutal scornfulness of his looks, declared himself"
35877,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"to be the monster Blasphemy. He uttered big words, and yet"
35878,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],ever and anon I observed that he turned pale at his own
35879,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],courage. We entered. Some remained in the opening of the           165
35880,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"cave, with the one or the other of its guardians. The rest, and"
35881,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"I among them, pressed on, till we reached an ample chamber,"
35882,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],that seemed the centre of the rock. The climate of the place
35883,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],was unnaturally cold.
35884,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],
35885,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],In the furthest distance of the chamber sate an old dim-eyed       170
35886,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"man, poring with a microscope over the torso of a statue"
35887,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"which had neither basis, nor feet, nor head; but on its breast"
35888,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"was carved Nature! To this he continually applied his glass,"
35889,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],and seemed enraptured with the various inequalities which it
35890,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],rendered visible on the seemingly polished surface of the          175
35891,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],marble.--Yet evermore was this delight and triumph followed
35892,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"by expressions of hatred, and vehement railing against a Being,"
35893,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"who yet, he assured us, had no existence. This mystery"
35894,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],suddenly recalled to me what I had read in the holiest recess
35895,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],of the temple of Superstition. The old man spake in divers         180
35896,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"tongues, and continued to utter other and most strange"
35897,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],mysteries. Among the rest he talked much and vehemently
35898,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"concerning an infinite series of causes and effects, which he"
35899,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"explained to be a string of blind men, the last of whom"
35900,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"caught hold of the skirt of the one before him, he of the next,    185"
35901,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],and so on till they were all out of sight; and that they all
35902,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"walked infallibly straight, without making one false step"
35903,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],though all were alike blind. Methought I borrowed courage
35904,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"from surprise, and asked him--Who then is at the head to"
35905,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"guide them? He looked at me with ineffable contempt, not           190"
35906,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"unmixed with an angry suspicion, and then replied, 'No one.'"
35907,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],The string of blind men went on for ever without any beginning;
35908,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"for although one blind man could not move without stumbling,"
35909,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],yet infinite blindness supplied the want of sight. I burst into
35910,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"laughter, which instantly turned to terror--for as he started      195"
35911,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"forward in rage, I caught a glimpse of him from behind; and"
35912,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],"lo! I beheld a monster bi-form and Janus-headed, in the hinder"
35913,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],face and shape of which I instantly recognised the dread
35914,ALLEGORIC VISION[1091:1],countenance of Superstition--and in the terror I awoke.

36846,MY DEAR FRIEND,MY DEAR FRIEND
36847,MY DEAR FRIEND,
36848,MY DEAR FRIEND,I have often amused myself with the thought of a self-conscious
36849,MY DEAR FRIEND,"Looking-glass, and the various metaphorical applications of such a"
36850,MY DEAR FRIEND,fancy--and this morning it struck across the Eolian Harp of my Brain
36851,MY DEAR FRIEND,that there was something pleasing and emblematic (of what I did not
36852,MY DEAR FRIEND,"distinctly make out) in two such Looking-glasses fronting, each seeing"
36853,MY DEAR FRIEND,"the other in itself, and itself in the other. Have you ever noticed the"
36854,MY DEAR FRIEND,Vault or snug little Apartment which the Spider spins and weaves for
36855,MY DEAR FRIEND,"itself, by spiral threads round and round, and sometimes with strait"
36856,MY DEAR FRIEND,"lines, so that its lurking parlour or withdrawing-room is an oblong"
36857,MY DEAR FRIEND,"square? This too connected itself in my mind with the melancholy truth,"
36858,MY DEAR FRIEND,"that as we grow older, the World (alas! how often it happens that the"
36859,MY DEAR FRIEND,"less we love it, the more we care for it, the less reason we have to"
36860,MY DEAR FRIEND,"value its Shews, the more anxious are we about them--alas! how often do"
36861,MY DEAR FRIEND,"we become more and more loveless, as Love which can outlive all change"
36862,MY DEAR FRIEND,"save a change with regard to itself, and all loss save the loss of its"
36863,MY DEAR FRIEND,"_Reflex_, is more needed to sooth us and alone is able so to do!) What"
36864,MY DEAR FRIEND,"was I saying? O, I was adverting to the fact that as we advance in"
36865,MY DEAR FRIEND,"years, the World, that spidery Witch, spins its threads narrower and"
36866,MY DEAR FRIEND,"narrower, still closing on us, till at last it shuts us up within four"
36867,MY DEAR FRIEND,"walls, walls of flues and films, windowless--and well if there be"
36868,MY DEAR FRIEND,"sky-lights, and a small opening left for the Light from above. I do not"
36869,MY DEAR FRIEND,"know that I have anything to add, except to remind you, that _pheer_ or"
36870,MY DEAR FRIEND,"_phere_ for _Mate_, _Companion_, _Counterpart_, is a word frequently"
36871,MY DEAR FRIEND,"used by Spencer (_sic_) and Herbert, and the Poets generally, who wrote"
36872,MY DEAR FRIEND,"before the Restoration (1660), before I say that this premature warm and"
36873,MY DEAR FRIEND,"sunny day, antedating Spring, called forth the following."
36874,MY DEAR FRIEND,

36944,D,
36945,D,
36946,D,Line 34. Sir Isaac Newton at the end of the last edition of his Optics
36947,D,"supposes that a very subtile and elastic fluid, which he calls aether,"
36948,D,"is diffused thro' the pores of gross bodies, as well as thro' the open"
36949,D,spaces that are void of gross matter: he supposes it to pierce all
36950,D,"bodies, and to touch their least particles, acting on them with a force"
36951,D,proportional to their number or to the matter of the body on which it
36952,D,"acts. He supposes likewise, that it is rarer in the pores of bodies than"
36953,D,"in open spaces, and even rarer in small pores and dense bodies, than in"
36954,D,large pores and rare bodies; and also that its density increases in
36955,D,receding from gross matter; so for instance as to be greater at the
36956,D,"1/100 of an inch from the surface of any body, than at its surface; and"
36957,D,so on. To the action of this aether he ascribes the attractions of
36958,D,"gravitation and cohoesion, the attraction and repulsion of electrical"
36959,D,"bodies, the mutual influences of bodies and light upon each other, the"
36960,D,"effects and communication of heat, and the performance of animal"
36961,D,"sensation and motion. David Hartley, from whom this account of aether is"
36962,D,"chiefly borrowed, makes it the instrument of propagating those"
36963,D,"vibrations or configurative motions which are ideas. It appears to me,"
36964,D,no hypothesis ever involved so many contradictions; for how can the same
36965,D,fluid be both dense and rare in the same body at one time? Yet in the
36966,D,"Earth as gravitating to the Moon, it must be very rare; and in the Earth"
36967,D,"as gravitating to the Sun, it must be very dense. For as Andrew Baxter"
36968,D,"well observes, it doth not appear sufficient to account how the fluid"
36969,D,may act with a force proportional to the body to which another is
36970,D,"impelled, to assert that it is rarer in great bodies than in small ones;"
36971,D,it must be further asserted that this fluid is rarer or denser in the
36972,D,"same body, whether small or great, according as the body to which that"
36973,D,is impelled is itself small or great. But whatever may be the solidity
36974,D,"of this objection, the following seems unanswerable:"
36975,D,
36976,D,If every particle thro' the whole solidity of a heavy body receive its
36977,D,"impulse from the particles of this fluid, it should seem that the fluid"
36978,D,"itself must be as dense as the very densest heavy body, gold for"
36979,D,"instance; there being as many impinging particles in the one, as there"
36980,D,are gravitating particles in the other which receive their gravitation
36981,D,"by being impinged upon: so that, throwing gold or any heavy body upward,"
36982,D,"against the impulse of this fluid, would be like throwing gold _thro'_"
36983,D,gold; and as this aether must be equally diffused over the whole sphere
36984,D,"of its activity, it must be as dense when it impels cork as when it"
36985,D,"impels gold, so that to throw a piece of cork upward, would be as if we"
36986,D,endeavoured to make cork penetrate a medium as dense as gold; and tho'
36987,D,we were to adopt the extravagant opinions which have been advanced
36988,D,"concerning the progression of pores, yet however porous we suppose a"
36989,D,"body, if it be not all pore, the argument holds equally, the fluid must"
36990,D,be as dense as the body in order to give every particle its impulse.
36991,D,
36992,D,It has been asserted that Sir Isaac Newton's philosophy leads in its
36993,D,"consequences to Atheism: perhaps not without reason. For if matter, by"
36994,D,"any powers or properties _given_ to it, can produce the order of the"
36995,D,visible world and even generate thought; why may it not have possessed
36996,D,such properties by _inherent_ right? and where is the necessity of a
36997,D,God? matter is according to the mechanic philosophy capable of acting
36998,D,most wisely and most beneficently without Wisdom or Benevolence; and
36999,D,"what more does the Atheist assert? if matter possess those properties,"
37000,D,why might it not have possessed them from all eternity? Sir Isaac
37001,D,Newton's Deity seems to be alternately operose and indolent; to have
37002,D,delegated so much power as to make it inconceivable what he can have
37003,D,reserved. He is dethroned by Vice-regent second causes.
37004,D,
37005,D,We seem placed here to acquire a knowledge of _effects_. Whenever we
37006,D,"would pierce into the _Adyta_ of Causation, we bewilder ourselves; and"
37007,D,"all that laborious Conjecture can do, is to fill up the gaps of"
37008,D,"imagination. We are restless, because _invisible_ things are not the"
37009,D,"objects of vision--and philosophical systems, for the most part, are"
37010,D,"received not for their Truth, but in proportion as they attribute to"
37011,D,"Causes a susceptibility of being _seen_, whenever our visual organs"
37012,D,shall have become sufficiently powerful.

37030,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"Soon after the commencement of this month, the Editor of the Cambridge"
37031,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"Intelligencer (a newspaper conducted with so much ability, and such"
37032,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"unmixed and fearless zeal for the interests of Piety and Freedom, that I"
37033,MY DEAR FRIEND--,cannot but think my poetry honoured by being permitted to appear in it)
37034,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"requested me, by Letter, to furnish him with some Lines for the last day"
37035,MY DEAR FRIEND--,of this Year. I promised him that I would make the attempt; but almost
37036,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"immediately after, a rheumatic complaint seized on my head, and"
37037,MY DEAR FRIEND--,continued to prevent the possibility of poetic composition till within
37038,MY DEAR FRIEND--,the last three days. So in the course of the last three days the
37039,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"following Ode was produced. In general, when an Author informs the"
37040,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"Public that his production was struck off in a great hurry, he offers an"
37041,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"insult, not an excuse. But I trust that the present case is an"
37042,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"exception, and that the peculiar circumstances which obliged me to write"
37043,MY DEAR FRIEND--,with such unusual rapidity give a propriety to my professions of it:
37044,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"_nec nunc eam apud te jacto, sed et ceteris indico; ne quis asperiore"
37045,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"lim√¢ carmen examinet, et a confuso scriptum et quod frigidum erat ni"
37046,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"statim traderem_.[1113:2] (I avail myself of the words of Statius, and"
37047,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"hope that I shall likewise be able to say of any weightier publication,"
37048,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"what _he_ has declared of his Thebaid, that it had been tortured[1113:3]"
37049,MY DEAR FRIEND--,with a laborious Polish.)
37050,MY DEAR FRIEND--,
37051,MY DEAR FRIEND--,For me to discuss the _literary_ merits of this hasty composition were
37052,MY DEAR FRIEND--,idle and presumptuous. If it be found to possess that impetuosity of
37053,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"Transition, and that Precipitation of Fancy and Feeling, which are the"
37054,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"_essential_ excellencies of the sublimer Ode, its deficiency in less"
37055,MY DEAR FRIEND--,important respects will be easily pardoned by those from whom alone
37056,MY DEAR FRIEND--,praise could give me pleasure: and whose minuter criticisms will be
37057,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"disarmed by the reflection, that these Lines were conceived 'not in the"
37058,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"soft obscurities of Retirement, or under the Shelter of Academic Groves,"
37059,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"but amidst inconvenience and distraction, in sickness and in"
37060,MY DEAR FRIEND--,sorrow'.[1114:1] I am more anxious lest the _moral_ spirit of the Ode
37061,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"should be mistaken. You, I am sure, will not fail to recollect that"
37062,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"among the Ancients, the Bard and the Prophet were one and the same"
37063,MY DEAR FRIEND--,"character; and you _know_, that although I prophesy curses, I pray"

37106,F,"In this sketch of a tragedy, all is imperfect, and much obscure. Among"
37107,F,other equally great defects (millstones round the slender neck of its
37108,F,"merits) it presupposes a long story; and this long story, which yet is"
37109,F,"necessary to the complete understanding of the play, is not half told."
37110,F,Albert had sent a letter informing his family that he should arrive
37111,F,about such a time by ship; he was shipwrecked; and wrote a private
37112,F,"letter to Osorio, informing him alone of this accident, that he might"
37113,F,"not shock Maria. Osorio destroyed the letter, and sent assassins to meet"
37114,F,"Albert. . . Worse than all, the growth of Osorio's character is nowhere"
37115,F,explained--and yet I had most clear and psychologically accurate ideas
37116,F,"of the whole of it. . . A man, who from constitutional calmness of"
37117,F,"appetites, is seduced into pride and the love of power, by these into"
37118,F,"misanthropism, or rather a contempt of mankind, and from thence, by the"
37119,F,"co-operation of envy, and a curiously modified love for a beautiful"
37120,F,"female (which is nowhere developed in the play), into a most atrocious"
37121,F,"guilt. A man who is in truth a weak man, yet always duping himself into"
37122,F,the belief that he has a soul of iron. Such were some of my leading
37123,F,ideas.

38434,PREFACE,PREFACE
38435,PREFACE,
38436,PREFACE,Poems on various subjects written at different times and prompted by
38437,PREFACE,very different feelings; but which will be read at one time and under
38438,PREFACE,the influence of one set of feelings--this is an heavy disadvantage: for
38439,PREFACE,we love or admire a poet in proportion as he developes our own
38440,PREFACE,"sentiments and emotions, or reminds us of our own knowledge."
38441,PREFACE,
38442,PREFACE,Compositions resembling those of the present volume are not unfrequently
38443,PREFACE,condemned for their querulous egotism. But egotism is to be condemned
38444,PREFACE,"then only when it offends against time and place, as in an History or an"
38445,PREFACE,Epic Poem. To censure it in a Monody or Sonnet is almost as absurd as to
38446,PREFACE,dislike a circle for being round. Why then write Sonnets or Monodies?
38447,PREFACE,Because they give me pleasure when perhaps nothing else could. After the
38448,PREFACE,"more violent emotions of Sorrow, the mind demands solace and can find it"
38449,PREFACE,in employment alone; but full of its late sufferings it can endure no
38450,PREFACE,employment not connected with those sufferings. Forcibly to turn away
38451,PREFACE,our attention to other subjects is a painful and in general an
38452,PREFACE,unavailing effort.
38453,PREFACE,
38454,PREFACE,"""But O how grateful to a wounded heart"
38455,PREFACE,The tale of misery to impart;
38456,PREFACE,From others' eyes bid artless sorrows flow
38457,PREFACE,"And raise esteem upon the base of woe!""[1136:1]"
38458,PREFACE,
38459,PREFACE,The communicativeness of our nature leads us to describe our own
38460,PREFACE,sorrows; in the endeavor to describe them intellectual activity is
38461,PREFACE,exerted; and by a benevolent law of our nature from intellectual
38462,PREFACE,activity a pleasure results which is gradually associated and mingles as
38463,PREFACE,a corrective with the painful subject of the description. True! it may
38464,PREFACE,"be answered, but how are the PUBLIC interested in your sorrows or your"
38465,PREFACE,description? We are for ever attributing a personal unity to imaginary
38466,PREFACE,aggregates. What is the PUBLIC but a term for a number of scattered
38467,PREFACE,individuals of whom as many will be interested in these sorrows as have
38468,PREFACE,experienced the same or similar?
38469,PREFACE,
38470,PREFACE,"""Holy be the Lay,"
38471,PREFACE,"Which mourning soothes the mourner on his way!"""
38472,PREFACE,
38473,PREFACE,There is one species of egotism which is truly disgusting; not that
38474,PREFACE,"which leads us to communicate our feelings to others, but that which"
38475,PREFACE,would reduce the feelings of others to an identity with our own. The
38476,PREFACE,"Atheist, who exclaims ""pshaw!"" when he glances his eye on the praises of"
38477,PREFACE,"Deity, is an Egotist; an old man, when he speaks contemptuously of"

38479,PREFACE,"Egotists, when they condemn all ""melancholy discontented"" verses."
38480,PREFACE,
38481,PREFACE,Surely it would be candid not merely to ask whether the Poem pleases
38482,PREFACE,"ourselves, but to consider whether or no there may not be others to whom"
38483,PREFACE,it is well-calculated to give an innocent pleasure. With what anxiety
38484,PREFACE,every fashionable author avoids the word _I_!--now he transforms himself
38485,PREFACE,"into a third person,--""the present writer""--now multiplies himself and"
38486,PREFACE,"swells into ""_we_""--and all this is the watchfulness of guilt. Conscious"
38487,PREFACE,that this said _I_ is perpetually intruding on his mind and that it
38488,PREFACE,"monopolizes his heart, he is prudishly solicitous that it may not escape"
38489,PREFACE,from his lips.
38490,PREFACE,
38491,PREFACE,This disinterestedness of phrase is in general commensurate with
38492,PREFACE,selfishness of feeling: men old and hackneyed in the ways of the world

38500,PREFACE,I could recollect no title more descriptive of the manner and matter of

38642,[INTRODUCTION],[INTRODUCTION]
38643,[INTRODUCTION],
38644,[INTRODUCTION],The composition of the Sonnet has been regulated by Boileau in his Art /
38645,[INTRODUCTION],"of Poetry, and since Boileau, by William Preston, in the elegant preface"
38646,[INTRODUCTION],"/ to his Amatory Poems: the rules, which they would establish, are"
38647,[INTRODUCTION],founded / on the practice of Petrarch. I have never yet been able to
38648,[INTRODUCTION],"discover either / sense, nature, or poetic fancy in Petrarch's poems;"
38649,[INTRODUCTION],they appear to me all / one cold glitter of heavy conceits and
38650,[INTRODUCTION],"metaphysical abstractions. How/ever, Petrarch, although not the inventor"
38651,[INTRODUCTION],"of the Sonnet, was the first / who made it popular; and _his_ countrymen"
38652,[INTRODUCTION],have taken his poems as the / model. Charlotte Smith and Bowles are they
38653,[INTRODUCTION],who first made the Sonnet / popular among the present English: I am
38654,[INTRODUCTION],justified therefore by analogy / in deducing its laws from _their_
38655,[INTRODUCTION],compositions.
38656,[INTRODUCTION],
38657,[INTRODUCTION],"The Sonnet then is a small poem, in which some lonely feeling is"
38658,[INTRODUCTION],"de/veloped. It is limited to a _particular_ number of lines, in order"
38659,[INTRODUCTION],that the / reader's mind having expected the close at the place in which
38660,[INTRODUCTION],"he finds it, / may rest satisfied; and that so the poem may acquire, as"
38661,[INTRODUCTION],"it were, a _Totality_,/--in 15 plainer phrase, may become a _Whole_. It"
38662,[INTRODUCTION],"is confined to fourteen lines, / because as some particular number is"
38663,[INTRODUCTION],"necessary, and that particular / number must be a small one, it may as"
38664,[INTRODUCTION],well be fourteen as any other / number. When no reason can be adduced
38665,[INTRODUCTION],"against a thing, Custom is a / sufficient reason for it. Perhaps, if the"
38666,[INTRODUCTION],"Sonnet were comprized in less / than fourteen lines, it would become a"
38667,[INTRODUCTION],"serious Epigram; if it extended to / more, it would encroach on the"
38668,[INTRODUCTION],"province of the Elegy. Poems, in which / no lonely feeling is developed,"
38669,[INTRODUCTION],are not Sonnets because the Author has / chosen to write them in
38670,[INTRODUCTION],"fourteen lines; they should rather be entitled / Odes, or Songs, or"
38671,[INTRODUCTION],Inscriptions. The greater part of Warton's Sonnets are / severe and
38672,[INTRODUCTION],masterly likenesses of the style of the Greek +epigrammata+.
38673,[INTRODUCTION],
38674,[INTRODUCTION],"In a Sonnet then we require a developement of some lonely feeling, by /"
38675,[INTRODUCTION],whatever cause it may have been excited; but those Sonnets appear to me
38676,[INTRODUCTION],"/ the most exquisite, in which moral Sentiments, Affections, or"
38677,[INTRODUCTION],"Feelings, / are deduced from, and associated with, the scenery of"
38678,[INTRODUCTION],Nature. Such / compositions generate a habit of thought highly
38679,[INTRODUCTION],favourable to delicacy of / character. They create a sweet and
38680,[INTRODUCTION],indissoluble union between the / intellectual and the material world.
38681,[INTRODUCTION],"Easily remembered from their briefness, / and interesting alike to the"
38682,[INTRODUCTION],"eye and the affections, these are the poems / which we can ""lay up in"
38683,[INTRODUCTION],"our heart, and our soul,"" and repeat them ""when / we walk by the way,"
38684,[INTRODUCTION],"and when we lie down, and when we rise up"". / Hence the Sonnets of"
38685,[INTRODUCTION],_Bowles_ derive their marked superiority over all / other Sonnets; hence
38686,[INTRODUCTION],"they domesticate with the heart, and become, as it / were, a part of our"
38687,[INTRODUCTION],identity.
38688,[INTRODUCTION],
38689,[INTRODUCTION],"Respecting the metre of a Sonnet, the Writer should consult his own /"
38690,[INTRODUCTION],"convenience.--Rhymes, many or few, or no rhymes at all--whatever the /"
38691,[INTRODUCTION],"chastity of his ear may prefer, whatever the rapid expression of his /"
38692,[INTRODUCTION],feelings will permit;--all these things are left at his own disposal. A
38693,[INTRODUCTION],same/ness in the final sound of its words is the great and grievous
38694,[INTRODUCTION],"defect of the / Italian language. That rule, therefore, which the"
38695,[INTRODUCTION],"Italians have estab/lished, of exactly _four_ different sounds in the"
38696,[INTRODUCTION],"Sonnet, seems to have arisen / from their wish to have _as many_, not"
38697,[INTRODUCTION],from any dread of finding _more_. But / surely it is ridiculous to make
38698,[INTRODUCTION],the _defect_ of a foreign language a reason for / our not availing
38699,[INTRODUCTION],"ourselves of one of the marked excellencies of our own. / ""The Sonnet"
38700,[INTRODUCTION],"(says Preston,) will ever be cultivated by those who write on / tender,"
38701,[INTRODUCTION],pathetic subjects. It is peculiarly adapted to the state of a man /
38702,[INTRODUCTION],"violently agitated by a real passion, and wanting composure and vigor of"
38703,[INTRODUCTION],/ mind to methodize his thought. It is fitted to express a momentary
38704,[INTRODUCTION],"burst / of Passion"" etc. Now, if there be one species of composition"
38705,[INTRODUCTION],"more difficult / and artificial than another, it is an English Sonnet on"
38706,[INTRODUCTION],the Italian Model. / Adapted to the agitations of a real passion!
38707,[INTRODUCTION],Express momentary bursts / of feeling in it! I should sooner expect to
38708,[INTRODUCTION],write pathetic _Axes_ or _pour / forth Extempore Eggs_ and
38709,[INTRODUCTION],_Altars_![1140:1] But the best confutation of such idle rules / is to be
38710,[INTRODUCTION],"found in the Sonnets of those who have observed them, in their /"
38711,[INTRODUCTION],"inverted sentences, their quaint phrases, and incongruous mixture of /"
38712,[INTRODUCTION],"obsolete and Spenserian words: and when, at last, the thing is toiled"
38713,[INTRODUCTION],"and / hammered into fit shape, it is in general racked and tortured"
38714,[INTRODUCTION],"Prose rather / than any thing resembling Poetry. Miss Seward, who has"
38715,[INTRODUCTION],perhaps / succeeded the best in these laborious trifles and who most
38716,[INTRODUCTION],"dogmatically / insists on what she calls ""the sonnet-claim,"" has written"
38717,[INTRODUCTION],"a very in/genious although unintentional burlesque on her own system, in"
38718,[INTRODUCTION],the / following lines prefixed to the Poems of a Mr. Carey.

38867,V,"[Carolus Utenhovius (Utenhove, or Uyttenhove) and Ptolomoeus Luxius"
38868,V,Tasteus were scholar friends of the Scottish poet and historian George
38869,V,"Buchanan (1506-1582), who prefixes some Iambics 'Carolo Utenhovio F. S.'"
38870,V,to his Hexameters 'Franciscanus et Fratres'. In some Elegiacs addressed
38871,V,"to Tasteus and Tevius, in which he complains of his sufferings from gout"
38872,V,"and kindred maladies, he tells them that Groscollius (Professor of"
38873,V,Medicine at the University of Paris) was doctoring him with herbs and by
38874,V,suggestion:--'Et spe languentem consilioque juvat'. Hence the three
38875,V,names. In another set of Iambics entitled 'Mutuus Amor' in which he
38876,V,celebrates the alliance between Scotland and England he writes:--
38877,V,
38878,V,Non mortis hoc propinquitas
38879,V,Non temporis longinquitas
38880,V,"Solvet, fides quod nexuit"
38881,V,Intaminata vinculum.
38882,V,
38883,V,"Hence the wording of the motto. Groscollius is, of course, a _mot √†"
38884,V,double entente_. It is a name and a nickname. The interpretation of the
38885,V,names and the reference to Buchanan's Hexameters were first pointed out
38886,V,"by Mr. T. Hutchinson in the _Athenaeum_, Dec. 10, 1898.]"

38964,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION,Compositions resembling those of the present volume are not

38966,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION,"be / condemned then only when it offends against Time and Place, as in"
38967,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION,an / History or an Epic Poem. To censure it in a Monody or Sonnet is
38968,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION,almost / as absurd as to dislike a circle for being round. Why then
38969,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION,write Sonnets / or Monodies? Because they give me pleasure when perhaps
38970,PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION,"nothing else / could. After the more violent emotions of Sorrow, the"

38981,SHAW.,
38982,SHAW.,The communicativeness of our Nature leads us to describe our own /
38983,SHAW.,"sorrows; in the endeavour to describe them, intellectual activity is"
38984,SHAW.,"exerted; / and from intellectual activity there results a pleasure,"
38985,SHAW.,"which is gradually / associated, and mingles as a corrective, with the"
38986,SHAW.,"painful subject of the / description. ""True!"" (it may be answered) ""but"
38987,SHAW.,"how are the PUBLIC / interested in your Sorrows or your Description?"" We"
38988,SHAW.,are for ever / attributing personal Unities to imaginary
38989,SHAW.,"Aggregates.--What is the PUBLIC, / but a term for a number of scattered"
38990,SHAW.,"Individuals? Of whom as many / will be interested in these sorrows, as"
38991,SHAW.,have experienced the same or / similar.
38992,SHAW.,
38993,SHAW.,"""Holy be the lay,"
38994,SHAW.,"Which mourning soothes the mourner on his way."""
38995,SHAW.,
38996,SHAW.,"If I could judge of others by myself, I should not hesitate to affirm,"
38997,SHAW.,that / the most interesting passages in our most interesting Poems are
38998,SHAW.,"those, in / which the Author developes his own feelings. The sweet voice"
38999,SHAW.,of Cona[1144:1] / never sounds so sweetly as when it speaks of itself;
39000,SHAW.,"and I should almost / suspect that man of an unkindly heart, who could"
39001,SHAW.,read the opening of the / third book of the Paradise Lost without
39002,SHAW.,"peculiar emotion. By a law of / our Nature, he, who labours under a"
39003,SHAW.,"strong feeling, is impelled to seek for / sympathy; but a Poet's"
39004,SHAW.,feelings are all strong. Quicquid amet valde amat. / Akenside therefore
39005,SHAW.,"speaks with philosophical accuracy, when he classes / Love and Poetry,"
39006,SHAW.,as producing the same effects:
39007,SHAW.,
39008,SHAW.,"""Love and the wish of Poets when their tongue"
39009,SHAW.,"Would teach to others' bosoms, what so charms                       40"
39010,SHAW.,"Their own.""--PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION."
39011,SHAW.,
39012,SHAW.,There is one species of Egotism which is truly disgusting; not that /
39013,SHAW.,"which leads us to communicate our feelings to others, but that which /"
39014,SHAW.,would reduce the feelings of others to an identity with our own. The /
39015,SHAW.,"Atheist, who exclaims, ""pshaw!"" when he glances his eye on the praises /"
39016,SHAW.,"of Deity, is an Egotist: an old man, when he speaks contemptuously of /"
39017,SHAW.,Love-verses is an Egotist: and the sleek Favorites of Fortune are /
39018,SHAW.,"Egotists, when they condemn all ""melancholy, discontented"" verses. /"
39019,SHAW.,"Surely, it would be candid not merely to ask whether the poem pleases /"
39020,SHAW.,ourselves but to consider whether or no there may not be others to whom
39021,SHAW.,/ it is well-calculated to give an innocent pleasure.
39022,SHAW.,
39023,SHAW.,"I shall only add that each of my readers will, I hope, remember that /"
39024,SHAW.,"these Poems on various subjects, which he reads at one time and under /"
39025,SHAW.,"the influence of one set of feelings, were written at different times"
39026,SHAW.,and / prompted by very different feelings; and therefore that the
39027,SHAW.,supposed / inferiority of one Poem to another may sometimes be owing to
39028,SHAW.,"the temper / of mind, in which he happens to peruse it."

39034,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
39035,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,I return my acknowledgments to the different Reviewers for the /
39036,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"assistance, which they have afforded me, in detecting my poetic"
39037,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,deficien/cies. I have endeavoured to avail myself of their remarks: one
39038,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"third of / the former Volume I have omitted, and the imperfections of"
39039,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"the republished / part must be considered as errors of taste, not faults"
39040,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,of carelessness. My / poems have been rightly charged with a profusion
39041,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"of double-epithets, and / a general turgidness. I have pruned the"
39042,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,double-epithets with no sparing / hand; and used my best efforts to tame
39043,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,the swell and glitter both of / thought and diction. This latter fault
39044,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,however had insinuated itself / into my Religious Musings with such
39045,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"intricacy of union, that sometimes / I have omitted to disentangle the"
39046,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,weed from the fear of snapping the / flower. A third and heavier
39047,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"accusation has been brought against me, that / of obscurity; but not, I"
39048,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"think, with equal justice. An Author is obscure / when his conceptions"
39049,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"are dim and imperfect, and his language incorrect, / or unappropriate,"
39050,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"or involved. A poem that abounds in allusions, / like the Bard of Gray,"
39051,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"or one that impersonates high and abstract / truths, like Collins's Ode"
39052,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"on the poetical character, claims not to be / popular--but should be"
39053,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,acquitted of obscurity. The deficiency is in the / Reader. But this is a
39054,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"charge which every poet, whose imagination is / warm and rapid, must"
39055,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,expect from his _contemporaries_. Milton did not / escape it; and it was
39056,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,adduced with virulence against Gray and Collins. / We now hear no more
39057,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"of it; not that their poems are better understood / at present, than"
39058,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,they were at their first publication; but their fame is / established;
39059,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"and a critic would accuse himself of frigidity or inattention, / who"
39060,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,should profess not to understand them. But a living writer is yet / sub
39061,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,judice; and if we cannot follow his conceptions or enter into his /
39062,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"feelings, it is more consoling to our pride to consider him as lost"
39063,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"beneath, / than as soaring above, us. If any man expect from my poems"
39064,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"the same / easiness of style which he admires in a drinking-song, for"
39065,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,"him I have not / written. Intelligibilia, non intellectum adfero."
39066,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,
39067,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,I expect neither profit nor general fame by my writings; and I consider
39068,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,/ myself as having been amply repayed without either. Poetry has been to

39070,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,afflictions: it / has multiplied and refined my enjoyments; it has
39071,PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION,endeared solitude; / and it has given me the habit of wishing to

39146,ADVERTISEMENT,
39147,ADVERTISEMENT,"I have excepted the following Poems from those, which I had determined"
39148,ADVERTISEMENT,"to omit. Some intelligent friends particularly requested it, observing,"
39149,ADVERTISEMENT,"that what most delighted me when I was ""young in _writing_ poetry, would"
39150,ADVERTISEMENT,probably best please those who are young in _reading_ poetry: and a man
39151,ADVERTISEMENT,"must learn to be _pleased_ with a subject, before he can yield that"
39152,ADVERTISEMENT,"attention to it, which is requisite in order to acquire a just taste."" I"
39153,ADVERTISEMENT,"however was fully convinced, that he, who gives to the press what he"
39154,ADVERTISEMENT,"does not thoroughly approve in his own closet, commits an act of"
39155,ADVERTISEMENT,"disrespect, both against himself and his fellow-citizens. The request"
39156,ADVERTISEMENT,"and the reasoning would not, therefore, have influenced me, had they not"
39157,ADVERTISEMENT,"been assisted by other motives. The first in order of these verses,"
39158,ADVERTISEMENT,"which I have thus endeavoured to _reprieve_ from immediate oblivion, was"
39159,ADVERTISEMENT,"originally addressed ""To the Author of Poems published anonymously, at"
39160,ADVERTISEMENT,"Bristol."" A second edition of these poems has lately appeared with the"
39161,ADVERTISEMENT,Author's name prefixed; and I could not refuse myself the gratification
39162,ADVERTISEMENT,"of seeing the name of that man among my poems, without whose kindness"
39163,ADVERTISEMENT,they would probably have remained unpublished; and to whom I know myself
39164,ADVERTISEMENT,"greatly and variously obliged, as a Poet, a Man and a Christian."
39165,ADVERTISEMENT,
39166,ADVERTISEMENT,"The second is entitled ""An Effusion on an Autumnal Evening; written in"
39167,ADVERTISEMENT,"early youth."" In a note to this poem I had asserted that the tale of"
39168,ADVERTISEMENT,"Florio in Mr. Rogers' ""Pleasures of Memory"" was to be found in the"
39169,ADVERTISEMENT,Lochleven of Bruce. I did (and still do) perceive a certain likeness
39170,ADVERTISEMENT,between the two stories; but certainly not a sufficient one to justify
39171,ADVERTISEMENT,"my assertion. I feel it my duty, therefore, to apologize to the Author"
39172,ADVERTISEMENT,"and the Public, for this rashness; and my sense of honesty would not"
39173,ADVERTISEMENT,have been satisfied by the bare omission of the note. No one can see
39174,ADVERTISEMENT,more clearly the _littleness_ and futility of imagining plagiarisms in
39175,ADVERTISEMENT,"the works of men of Genius; but _nemo omnibus horis sapit_; and my mind,"
39176,ADVERTISEMENT,"at the time of writing that note, was sick and sore with anxiety, and"
39177,ADVERTISEMENT,weakened through much suffering. I have not the most distant knowledge
39178,ADVERTISEMENT,"of Mr. Rogers, except as a correct and elegant Poet. If any of my"
39179,ADVERTISEMENT,"readers should know him personally, they would oblige me by informing"
39180,ADVERTISEMENT,"him that I have expiated a sentence of unfounded detraction, by an"
39181,ADVERTISEMENT,unsolicited and self-originating apology.
39182,ADVERTISEMENT,
39183,ADVERTISEMENT,"Having from these motives re-admitted two, and those the longest of the"
39184,ADVERTISEMENT,"poems I had omitted, I yielded a passport to the three others, [pp. 256,"
39185,ADVERTISEMENT,"262, 264] which were recommended by the greatest number of votes. There"
39186,ADVERTISEMENT,are some lines too of Lloyd's and Lamb's in this Appendix. They had been
39187,ADVERTISEMENT,"omitted in the former part of the volume, partly by accident; but I"
39188,ADVERTISEMENT,"have reason to believe that the Authors regard them, as of inferior"
39189,ADVERTISEMENT,"merit; and they are therefore rightly placed, where they will receive"
39190,ADVERTISEMENT,some beauty from their vicinity to others much worse.

39288,X,[The three poems which form the contents of the Pamphlet were included
39289,X,in the _Poetical Register_ for 1808-1809 which was reissued in 1812. The
39290,X,"publishers were F. G. and S. Rivington, the printers Law and Gilbert,"
39291,X,"St. John's Square, Clerkenwell. The type of the pamphlet is the type of"
39292,X,"the _Poetical Register_, but the poems were set up and reprinted as a"
39293,X,"distinct issue. There is no record of the transaction, or evidence that"
39294,X,the pamphlet was placed on the market. It was probably the outcome of a
39295,X,private arrangement between the author and the publisher of the
39296,X,_Poetical Register_.]

39369,PREFACE,"The following collection has been entitled SIBYLLINE LEAVES, in allusion"
39370,PREFACE,to the fragmentary and widely scattered state in which they have been
39371,PREFACE,long suffered to remain. It contains the whole of the author's poetical
39372,PREFACE,"compositions, from 1793 to the present date, with the exception of a few"
39373,PREFACE,"works not yet finished, and those published in the first edition of his"
39374,PREFACE,"juvenile poems, over which he has no controul.[1150:1] They may be"
39375,PREFACE,"divided into three classes: First, A selection from the Poems added to"
39376,PREFACE,"the second and third editions, together with those originally published"
39377,PREFACE,"in the LYRICAL BALLADS,[1150:2] which after having remained many years"
39378,PREFACE,"out of print, have been omitted by Mr. Wordsworth in the recent"
39379,PREFACE,"collection of all his minor poems, and of course revert to the author."
39380,PREFACE,"Second, Poems published at very different periods, in various obscure or"
39381,PREFACE,"perishable journals, etc., some with, some without the writer's consent;"
39382,PREFACE,"many imperfect, all incorrect. The third and last class is formed of"
39383,PREFACE,Poems which have hitherto remained in manuscript. The whole is now
39384,PREFACE,"presented to the reader collectively, with considerable additions and"
39385,PREFACE,"alterations, and as perfect as the author's judgment and powers could"
39386,PREFACE,render them.

39388,PREFACE,"In my Literary _Life_, it has been mentioned that, with the exception of"
39389,PREFACE,"this preface, the SIBYLLINE LEAVES have been printed almost two years;"

39391,PREFACE,"errata[1151:1] [forty-seven in number] which follows this preface, alone"
39392,PREFACE,"induces me to refer again to the circumstances, at the risk of ungenial"
39393,PREFACE,"feelings, from the recollection of its worthless causes.[1151:2] A few"
39394,PREFACE,corrections of later date have been added.--Henceforward the author must
39395,PREFACE,be occupied by studies of a very different kind.

40697,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"Moxon in 1852, bears the names of Derwent and Sara Coleridge, as joint"
40698,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"editors. In writing my name with my sister's, I yielded to her"
40699,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"particular desire and request, but the work was performed almost"
40700,_ADVERTISEMENT_,entirely by herself. My opinion was consulted as to the general
40701,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"arrangement, and more especially as to the choice or rejection of"
40702,_ADVERTISEMENT_,particular pieces. Even here I had no occasion to do more than confirm
40703,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"the conclusions to which she had herself arrived, and sanction the"
40704,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"course which she had herself adopted. I shared in the responsibility,"
40705,_ADVERTISEMENT_,but cannot claim any share in the credit of the undertaking. This
40706,_ADVERTISEMENT_,edition I propose to leave intact as it came from her own hands. I wish
40707,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"it to remain as one among other monuments of her fine taste, her solid"
40708,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"judgment, and her scrupulous conscientiousness."

40714,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"further selection from the omitted pieces, principally from the Juvenile"
40715,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"Poems, have been added in an Appendix. So placed, they will not at any"
40716,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"rate interfere with the general effect of the collection, while they add"
40717,_ADVERTISEMENT_,to its completeness.
40718,_ADVERTISEMENT_,
40719,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"All these buds of promise were once withdrawn, and, afterwards"

40721,_ADVERTISEMENT_,"separation, which shall not be deemed either too indulgent, or too"
40722,_ADVERTISEMENT_,severe. [The concluding lines of the 'Advertisement' dealt with
40723,_ADVERTISEMENT_,questions of copyright].
