59,A DAY WITH BYRON.,A DAY WITH BYRON.
60,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
61,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
62,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"One February afternoon in the year 1822, about two o'clock,--for this"
63,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"is the hour at which his day begins,--""the most notorious personality"
64,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"of his century"" arouses himself, in the Palazzo Lanfranchi at Pisa."
65,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"George Gordon Noel, Lord Byron, languidly arises and dresses, with the"
66,A DAY WITH BYRON.,assistance of his devoted valet Fletcher. Invariably he awakes in very
67,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"low spirits, ""in actual despair and despondency,"" he has termed it: this"
68,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"is in part constitutional, and partly, no doubt, a reaction after the"
69,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"feverish brain-work of the previous night. It is, at any rate, in"
70,A DAY WITH BYRON.,unutterable melancholy and _ennui_ that he surveys in the mirror that
71,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"slight and graceful form, which had been idolised by London drawing-rooms,"
72,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"and that pale, scornful, beautiful face, ""like a spirit, good or evil,"""
73,A DAY WITH BYRON.,which the enthusiastic Walter Scott has termed a thing to dream of. He
74,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"notes the grey streaks already visible among his dark brown locks, and"
75,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"mutters his own lines miserably to himself,--"
76,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
77,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Through life's dull road, so dim and dirty,"
78,A DAY WITH BYRON.,I have dragg'd to three-and-thirty.
79,A DAY WITH BYRON.,What have these years left to me?
80,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Nothing--except thirty-three.
81,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
82,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"An innumerable motley crowd of reminiscences--most of them bitter,"
83,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"sorrowful, or contemptuous, throng across his mind, shaping themselves"
84,A DAY WITH BYRON.,into poignant verse:
85,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
86,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"There's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away,"
87,A DAY WITH BYRON.,When the glow of early thought declines in feeling's dull decay;
88,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"'Tis not on youth's smooth cheek the blush alone, which fades so fast,"
89,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere youth itself be past."
90,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
91,A DAY WITH BYRON.,*       *       *       *       *
92,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
93,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Oh! could I feel as I have felt,--or be what I have been,"
94,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Or weep as I could once have wept o'er many a vanished scene;
95,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"As springs in desert found seem sweet, all brackish though they be,"
96,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"So, 'midst the wither'd waste of life, those tears would flow to me."
97,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
98,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"A meagre breakfast,--of claret and soda with a few mouthfuls of some"
99,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Italian dish,--somewhat restores his natural vivacity: and he listens"
100,A DAY WITH BYRON.,with cynical amusement to Fletcher's blood-curdling stories of the
101,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"phantoms who have made night hideous. For the famous old feudal Palazzo,"
102,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"with its dungeons and secret chambers, has been immemorially infested"
103,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"with ghosts, and harassed by inexplicable noises. Fletcher has already"
104,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"begged leave to change his room, and then refused to occupy his new"
105,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"room, because, as his master reports, ""there are more ghosts there than"
106,A DAY WITH BYRON.,in the other!... There is one place where people were evidently walled
107,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"up ... I am bothered about these spectres, as they say the last occupants"
108,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"were too."" However, he is laughing as he descends the magnificent"
109,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"staircase,--the reputed work of Michael Angelo,--laughing until the"
110,A DAY WITH BYRON.,shrill querulous cries of peevish children make him stop and frown. He
111,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"has allowed the Leigh Hunts, with their large and fractious family, to"
112,A DAY WITH BYRON.,occupy for the present the ground-floor of the Palazzo; and children
113,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"are his pet abhorrence. ""I abominate the sight of them so much,"" he has"
114,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"already told Moore, ""that I have always had the greatest respect for"
115,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"the character of Herod!"" No child figures in any of his poems: his own"
116,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"paternal feeling towards ""Ada, sole daughter of my house and home,"" is"
117,A DAY WITH BYRON.,merely a fluctuating sentiment.
118,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
119,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"He shrugs his shoulders and enters his great _salon_, again moody and"
120,A DAY WITH BYRON.,with a downcast air: and throws himself upon a couch in gloomy reverie.
121,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Snatches of poetry wander through his thoughts--poetry intrinsically
122,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"autobiographical, for ""the inequalities of his style are those of his"
123,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"career,"" and his imaginary heroes are endless reproductions of himself,"
124,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"""the wandering outlaw of his own dark mind."" He has drawn his own"
125,A DAY WITH BYRON.,picture more effectively in _Lara_ than any strange hand could do.
126,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
127,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"In him, inexplicably mix'd, appear'd"
128,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Much to be loved and hated, sought and fear'd;"
129,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Opinion, varying o'er his hidden lot,"
130,A DAY WITH BYRON.,In praise or railing ne'er his name forgot....
131,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
132,A DAY WITH BYRON.,There was in him a vital scorn of all:
133,A DAY WITH BYRON.,As if the worst had fall'n which could befall;
134,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"He stood a stranger in this breathing world,"
135,A DAY WITH BYRON.,An erring spirit from another hurl'd....
136,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
137,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"His early dreams of good outstripp'd the truth,"
138,A DAY WITH BYRON.,And troubled manhood follow'd baffled youth.
139,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
140,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"His men, in short, as has been observed, are ""made after his own image,"
141,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"and his women after his own heart."" Yet the inveterate family likeness"
142,A DAY WITH BYRON.,of these heroes is not shared by the heroines of his romantic stanzas:
143,A DAY WITH BYRON.,for Byron has an eclectic taste in beauty. One can hardly imagine a
144,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"wider dissimilarity than between the _Bride of Abydos_, the gentle"
145,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Zuleika, with her"
146,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
147,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"""Nameless charms unmark'd by her alone--"
148,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
149,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"The light of love, the purity of grace,"
150,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"The mind, the music breathing from her face,"
151,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"The heart whose softness harmonised the whole,"
152,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"And oh! that eye was in itself a Soul."""
153,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
154,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"and ""Circassia's daughter,"" the stately Leila of _The Giaour_, whose"
155,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"black and flowing hair ""swept the marble where her feet gleamed whiter"
156,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"than the mountain sleet."" Or, if the reader seek a further choice, there"
157,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"is Medora, beloved of the Corsair,--Medora of the deep blue eye and long"
158,A DAY WITH BYRON.,fair hair; or the nameless Eastern maiden of the _Hebrew Melodies_:
159,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
160,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"She walks in beauty, like the night"
161,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
162,A DAY WITH BYRON.,And all that's best of dark and bright
163,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
164,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Thus mellow'd to that tender light
165,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
166,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
167,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"One shade the more, one ray the less,"
168,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Had half impair'd the nameless grace
169,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Which waves in every raven tress,"
170,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Or softly lightens o'er her face;
171,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Where thoughts serenely sweet express
172,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"How pure, how dear their dwelling-place."
173,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
174,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,"
175,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,"
176,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"The smiles that win, the tints that glow,"
177,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"But tell of days in goodness spent,"
178,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"A mind at peace with all below,"
179,A DAY WITH BYRON.,A heart whose love is innocent!
180,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
181,A DAY WITH BYRON.,Yet all these heroines are alike in one respect--their potentiality of
182,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"passionate emotion: since Byron's ""passions and his powers,"" according"
183,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"to his intense admirer Shelley, ""are incomparably greater than those of"
184,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"other men:"" and he has used the last almost recklessly in portrayal of"
185,A DAY WITH BYRON.,the first.
186,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
187,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"As the poet reclines in sombre meditation, his reverie is broken by"
188,A DAY WITH BYRON.,the not unwelcome entrance of his friends--who may be better termed
189,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"his intimate acquaintances. For, to that brooding, introspective"
190,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"spirit,--constitutionally shy, and morbidly conscious of the"
191,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"fact,--""friendship is a propensity,"" he has declared, ""to which my"
192,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"genius is very limited. I do not know the _male_ human being, except"
193,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Lord Clare, the friend of my infancy, for whom I feel anything that"
194,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"deserves the name. All my others are men-of-the-world friendships."""
195,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Be that as it may, it is with a warmly cordial expression, and with"
196,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"that peculiarly sweet smile of his, that Byron welcomes his usual"
197,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"visitors,--Captain Williams, Captain Medwin, Taafe the Irishman, and"
198,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Percy Bysshe Shelley, ""the most companionable person under thirty,"""
199,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"he has avowed, ""that ever I knew."" When they have discussed the latest"
200,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"little Pisan _on dits_, and the progress of Shelley's boat-building,"
201,A DAY WITH BYRON.,the conversation trends more and more towards literary topics: personal
202,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"topics, be it understood, for Byron is not an omnivorous reader like"
203,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Shelley. Williams and Medwin, themselves dabblers in verse and prose,"
204,A DAY WITH BYRON.,listen with respectful admiration to the _dicta_ of the great poets
205,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"exchanging views. The low, clear, harmonious voice of Byron ""is a sort"
206,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"of intoxication: men are held by it as under a spell."" He makes no"
207,A DAY WITH BYRON.,secret of his open contempt for the professional writing fraternity.
208,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"""Who would write, if he had anything better to do?"" he scornfully"
209,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"enquires, ""I think the mighty stir made about scribbling and scribes, by"
210,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"themselves and others, a sign of effeminacy, degeneracy, and weakness."""
211,A DAY WITH BYRON.,
212,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"Shelley, whose assiduous studies in literature have led him to quite"
213,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"other conclusions, defends his craft with ardour. But Byron's chief"
214,A DAY WITH BYRON.,successes have been too lightly won. He who wrote the _Corsair_ in ten
215,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"days, the _Bride of Abydos_ in four, and _Lara_ whilst undressing after"
216,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"balls and masquerades, cannot be expected to take a very serious view of"
217,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"poetry as the one business of a lifetime. ""I by no means rank poetry or"
218,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"poets,"" says he, ""high in the scale of imagination. Poetry is the lava"
219,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"of the imagination, whose eruption prevents an earthquake. If I live ten"
220,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"years longer,"" he adds prophetically, ""you will see that all is not over"
221,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"with me,--I don't mean in literature, for that is nothing, and, it may"
222,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"seem odd enough to say, I don't think it's my vocation. But you will see"
223,A DAY WITH BYRON.,"that I shall do _something_ or other!"""

232,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Into each other--and, beholding this,"
233,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss."""
234,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,(_Don Juan._)
235,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
236,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
237,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"This contemner of poesy, however, is soon persuaded, without much"
238,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"difficulty, to read aloud some excerpts from his new poems in process of"
239,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,completion: and very well he reads them. The listeners are moved to
240,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,smiles by the bitter humour of the _Vision of Judgment_: they are left
241,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,half breathless by the impetuous vigour of _Heaven and Earth_. But a
242,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"murmur of unfeigned applause punctuates the second canto of _Don Juan_,"
243,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"with its exquisite presentment of youth, love, and ecstasy in the"
244,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,persons of Juan and Haidée.
245,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
246,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded"
247,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,"
248,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,"
249,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,"
250,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded
251,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill,"
252,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Upon the other, and the rosy sky,"
253,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,With one star sparkling through it like an eye.
254,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,"
255,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Over the shining pebbles and the shells,"
256,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,Glided along the smooth and harden'd sand....
257,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
258,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,*       *       *       *       *
259,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
260,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow"
261,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;"
262,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"They gazed upon the glittering sea below,"
263,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;
264,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"They heard the waves splash, and the wind so low,"
265,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,And saw each other's dark eyes darting light
266,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Into each other--and, beholding this,"
267,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss."
268,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,(_Don Juan._)
269,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
270,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Byron's restless spirit, perpetually eager to express itself in"
271,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"action, now makes him anxious to dismiss intellectual discussions:"
272,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,and he hastily proposes a game of billiards. As he moves around the
273,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"billiard-table, his lameness is distinctly noticeable: not all the"
274,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"ingenuity of his tailor, nor his own efforts to walk naturally, can"
275,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"conceal it. Yet, as has been said of him in other matters, he redeems"
276,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,all his defects by his graces. And his companions note with surprise the
277,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"remarkable change for the better which has taken place in him since,"
278,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"a few months before, he arrived at this old palace on the Arno with a"
279,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"troop of servants, carriages, horses, fowls, dogs, and monkeys. The"
280,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,selfish and sensual Byron of Venetian days is entirely a thing of the
281,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"past. ""He is improved in every respect,""--says Shelley to Williams,"
282,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"""in genius, in temper, in moral views, in health and happiness."" And"
283,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"although keeping up a certain splendour upon an income of £4000 a year,"
284,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,he devotes £1000 of that income entirely to purposes of charity. His own
285,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,personal needs are of the simplest.
286,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
287,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"The game concluded, Byron's carriage is announced: his friends and"
288,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"he proceed in it as far as the town gates of Pisa, by this means to"
289,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,avoid the starers of the streets. Horses are in readiness at the gates:
290,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"the company, with one or two servant-men, mount and ride into the"
291,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,pine-forest that reaches towards the sea.
292,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
293,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Byron is as excellent and graceful a rider as a swimmer, with remarkable"
294,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"powers of endurance. He can cover seventy or eighty miles a day, fast"
295,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"going, and swim five miles at a stretch: he is indeed, in many respects,"
296,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,the typical open-air Englishman. But to-day he rides slowly and immersed
297,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"in thought. As his wife years since assured him, he is at heart the most"
298,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"melancholy of mankind, often when apparently the gayest. His abnormally"
299,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"long sight takes in every detail of the scenery,--storing it up"
300,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,unconsciously for future reference. It has been said that Byron is
301,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,nothing without his descriptions: and in these he has achieved some of
302,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"his finest work: notably in some immortal stanzas of _Childe Harold_,"
303,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,with their dazzling panoramic succession of vivid scenes: whether
304,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,depicting how
305,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
306,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs;"
307,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,A palace and a prison on each hand:
308,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,I saw from out the wave her structures rise
309,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand.

311,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"or, on the eve of Waterloo,"
312,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,
313,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"There was a sound of revelry by night,"
314,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,And Belgium's capital had gather'd then
315,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright"
316,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
317,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
318,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Music arose with its voluptuous swell,"
319,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,"Soft eyes look'd love to eyes which spake again,"
320,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,And all went merry as a marriage bell;
321,JUAN AND HAIDÉE.,But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!

365,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"which he visualizes."" And it is this magic power of conveying the"
366,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"authentic impression of an actual occurrence, which renders his most"
367,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"recondite situations so thrilling,--which breathes a Western vigour into"
368,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"the scented air of the Orient, and thrills with poignant pathos through"
369,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,the horrors of the _Prisoner of Chillon_.
370,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,
371,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,A light broke in upon my brain--
372,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,It was the carol of a bird;
373,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"It ceased, and then it came again,"
374,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,The sweetest song ear ever heard:
375,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,And mine was thankful till my eyes
376,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Ran over with the glad surprise,"
377,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,And they that moment could not see
378,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,I was the mate of misery;
379,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,But then by dull degrees came back
380,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,My senses to their wonted track;
381,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,I saw the dungeon walls and floor
382,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Close slowly round me as before,"
383,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,I saw the glimmer of the sun
384,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,Creeping as it before had done;
385,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,But through the crevice where it came
386,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"That bird was perch'd, as fond and tame,"
387,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,And tamer than upon the tree;
388,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"A lovely bird, with azure wings,"
389,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"And song that said a thousand things,"
390,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,And seem'd to say them all for me!
391,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"I never saw its like before,"
392,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,I ne'er shall see its likeness more:
393,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"It seem'd like me to want a mate,"
394,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"But was not half so desolate,"
395,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,And it was come to love me when
396,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"None lived to love me so again,"
397,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"And cheering from my dungeon's brink,"
398,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,Had brought me back to feel and think.
399,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"I know not if it late were free,"
400,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Or broke its cage to perch on mine,"
401,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"But knowing well captivity,"
402,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,Sweet bird! I could not wish for thine!
403,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Or if it were, in winged guise,"
404,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,A visitant from Paradise;
405,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,For--Heaven forgive that thought! the while
406,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,Which made me both to weep and smile--
407,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,I sometimes deem'd that it might be
408,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,My brother's soul come down to me;
409,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"But then at last away it flew,"
410,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"And then 'twas mortal well I knew,"
411,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"For he would never thus have flown,"
412,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"And left me twice so doubly lone,"
413,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Lone as the corse within its shroud,"
414,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Lone as a solitary cloud,--"
415,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"A single cloud on a sunny day,"
416,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"While all the rest of heaven is clear,"
417,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"A frown upon the atmosphere,"
418,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,That hath no business to appear
419,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"When skies are blue, and earth is gay."
420,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,(_The Prisoner of Chillon._)
421,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,
422,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Unhappily, all these shifting scenes of imagination or experience--so"
423,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,the poet has made mournful confession--have little power to wean him
424,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"from himself. ""Neither the music of the shepherd, the crashing of the"
425,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"avalanche, nor the torrent, the mountain, the glacier, the forest, nor"
426,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"the cloud, have for one moment lightened the weight upon my heart, nor"
427,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"enabled me to lose my own wretched identity in the majesty, and the"
428,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"power, and the glory, above, around, and beneath me."""
429,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,
430,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"And although, it will be noticed, he exempts the sea--and although the"
431,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"blood of old sea-kings, running fiercely in his veins, still kindles him"
432,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"to imperishable rapture in its presence,--"
433,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,
434,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy"
435,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
436,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Borne, like thy bubbles, onward: from a boy"
437,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,I wanton'd with thy breakers--they to me
438,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
439,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Made them a terror--'twas a pleasing fear,"
440,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"For I was as it were a child of thee,"
441,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"And trusted to thy billows far and near,"
442,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,And laid my hand upon thy mane--as I do here.

444,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,
445,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"--yet there is sorrow on the sea itself,--the ""unplumb'd, salt, estranging"
446,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"sea"" which separates him from his mother-country. Cosmopolitan as he"
447,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"is, self-banished exile, quick with Greek and Italian sympathies,"
448,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,Byron never for one moment forgets that he is head of one of England's
449,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,proudest families. Despite his scathing scorn towards his fair-weather
450,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"London friends, towards the unreasoning outbursts of malignity which"
451,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"drove him out of his England--with all her faults, he loves her still."
452,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,He vaguely hopes and hankers after a return to those long-lost shores:
453,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,and endeavours to believe that the future will in some way make atonement
454,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,for all the calamities of the past.
455,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,
456,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"But now Shelley, Williams, Medwin, and Taafe are dismounting in the pine"
457,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"forest, and the men-servants setting up the target. Pistol-practice"
458,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,is Byron's forte; when he hits a half-crown at twelve yards he is as
459,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"delighted as a boy, and quite glum and disconcerted if he should happen"
460,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"to miss. This very rarely happens, as he is a crack shot, easily"
461,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"distancing the other competitors. His hand trembles violently, but he"
462,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"calculates on this vibration, and, depending entirely on his eye, hardly"
463,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"ever fails. After about an hour's shooting, the light begins to wane"
464,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"towards sunset: and the friends ride back to the city, Byron in exuberant"
465,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,good humour with himself and everybody else. Arrived at the Palazzo
466,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Lanfranchi, he finds two guests awaiting him,--Count Pietro Gamba,"
467,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"brother of the lovely Contessa Guiccioli, and Trelawny, that handsome,"
468,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"picturesque, piratical-looking ""Younger Son,"" who has not yet published"
469,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"to an astonished world his remarkable and almost incredible ""Adventures."""
470,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Trelawny is at present in command of Byron's yacht the _Bolivar_, lying"
471,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,in the harbour of Genoa.
472,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,
473,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"The poet welcomes these new additions to his company: for, since his"
474,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"arrival in Pisa, he has begun to entertain men at dinner-parties, for"
475,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,the first time since leaving England. A very cheerful company sits down
476,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"with him to dinner: their host displays himself to great advantage,"
477,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"""being at once,"" to quote Shelley, ""polite and cordial, full of social"
478,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"hilarity and the most perfect good humour, never diverging into"
479,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"ungraceful merriment, and yet keeping up the spirit of liveliness"
480,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"throughout the evening."" Byron, according to his own declaration, has"
481,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,never passed two hours in mixed society without wishing himself out of
482,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"it again. Nobody, however, could guess at this fact from his bright,"
483,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"frank, and spontaneous gaiety. Always an abstemious eater--""I have fed"
484,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"at times for over two months together,"" he assures his friends, ""on"
485,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"sheer biscuit and water,""--very little food suffices him: and besides,"
486,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"_bien entendu_, he is anxious to retain that ""happy slenderness"" on"
487,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"which he prides himself,--the slenderness which is a characteristic"
488,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"of his family, and which he has recently endangered by a lazy life in"
489,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,Venice. The guests sit fascinated by his enthralling personality: they
490,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"recognize that he wears a natural greatness which ""his errors can only"
491,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"half obscure:"" and they rivet their gaze upon that pale and splendid"
492,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"face, the only one, as Scott says, that ever came up to an artist's"
493,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,notion of what the lineaments of a poet should be. He looks around
494,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"him upon the ethereal and feminine countenance of Shelley, the"
495,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"visionary,--the kind, pleasant, honest English faces of Medwin and"
496,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Williams,--the good-looking Italian Gamba, the quaint little Irishman"
497,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,"Taafe,--last, not least, the dark mustachios and wildly-flashing Celtic"
498,THE PRISONER OF CHILLON AND THE BIRD.,eyes of the Cornish adventurer Trelawny. This latter might well have

561,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"subtle influence of quietude steals down upon him from the stars. ""What"
562,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"nothings we are,"" he murmurs, ""before the least of these stars!"" One in"
563,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,particular--is it Sirius?--entrances his attention with its cold
564,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,refulgence of pure light. His thoughts involuntarily shape themselves in
565,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,rhythm and rhyme;
566,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,
567,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,Sun of the sleepless! melancholy star!
568,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,"

574,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"Distinct, but distant--clear--but oh! how cold!"
575,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,
576,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,It is the hour when Byron's brain becomes thronged with a glowing
577,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,phantasmagoria of ideas that cry aloud for visible expression. He
578,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"forgets, under the stress of creative impulse, the sources and causes of"
579,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"his inherent melancholy,--the miserable days of his childhood, with a"
580,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"Fury for a mother,--the wound, never to be healed, of his unrequited"
581,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"love for Mary Chaworth,--the inimical wife from whom he is eternally"
582,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"alienated,--the little daughter that he may never hold in his arms,--the"
583,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"beloved sister separated from his side,--the ancestral home of his"
584,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"forefathers now passed into a stranger's hold,--the meteoric glory and"
585,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"total eclipse of his unparalleled popularity in England,--the follies,"
586,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"and worse than follies, which have made him what he is, ""consistent in"
587,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"nothing but his passion and his pride."" These memories, like poisonous"
588,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"exhalations, are banished from his mind, and leave a clear horizon for a"
589,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"while,--a fertile landscape peopled with great words and images."
590,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,Something akin to inspiration seizes upon him: and he throws himself to
591,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,work with all the zest and nerve of his impulsive nature.
592,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,
593,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"This is a man who writes, in his own phrase, ""with rapidity and rarely"
594,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"with pains.... When I once take pen in hand, I _must_ say what comes"
595,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"uppermost or fling it away."" Not for him that careful polishing of"
596,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"sentences, which other writers meticulously bestow. ""I have always"
597,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"written as fast as I could put pen to paper, and never revised but in"
598,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,the proofs.... I can never recast anything. I am like the tiger; if I
599,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"miss the first spring, I go grumbling back to my jungle."" And to this"
600,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"impetuous directness of onslaught, his finest poems bear witness. Some"
601,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,critic has remarked that Byron is too much of the earth earthy to be a
602,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"great lyrical writer: yet a Promethean fire, stolen from heaven, burns"
603,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,"immortally through some of his shorter lyrics. In Greek, it is said,"
604,CONRAD AND GULNARE.,there are 1632 ways of expressing the simple fact _I love you_: yet who
