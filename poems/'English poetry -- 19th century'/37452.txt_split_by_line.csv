45,PREFATORY NOTE.,
46,PREFATORY NOTE.,
47,PREFATORY NOTE.,"In a recent ""Memoir of Elizabeth Barrett Browning,"" by John H. Ingram,"
48,PREFATORY NOTE.,"it is observed that ""such essays on her personal history as have"
49,PREFATORY NOTE.,"appeared, either in England or elsewhere, are replete with mistakes or"
50,PREFATORY NOTE.,"misstatements."" For these he proposes to substitute ""a correct if short"
51,PREFATORY NOTE.,"memoir:"" but, kindly and appreciative as may be Mr. Ingram's"
52,PREFATORY NOTE.,"performance, there occur not a few passages in it equally ""mistaken and"
53,PREFATORY NOTE.,"misstated."""
54,PREFATORY NOTE.,
55,PREFATORY NOTE.,"1. ""Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of Edward Moulton Barrett, was born"
56,PREFATORY NOTE.,"in London on the 4th of March, 1809."" Elizabeth was born, March 6, 1806,"
57,PREFATORY NOTE.,"at Coxhoe Hall, county of Durham, the residence of her father.[A]"
58,PREFATORY NOTE.,"""Before she was eleven she composed an epic on 'Marathon.'"" She was then"
59,PREFATORY NOTE.,fourteen.
60,PREFATORY NOTE.,
61,PREFATORY NOTE.,"2. ""It is said that Mr. Barrett was a man of intellect and culture, and"
62,PREFATORY NOTE.,"therefore able to direct his daughter's education, but be that so or"
63,PREFATORY NOTE.,"not, he obtained for her the tutorial assistance of the well-known Greek"
64,PREFATORY NOTE.,scholar Hugh Stuart Boyd ... who was also a writer of fluent verse: and
65,PREFATORY NOTE.,his influence and instruction doubtless confirmed Miss Barrett in her
66,PREFATORY NOTE.,"poetical aspirations."" Mr. Boyd, early deprived of sight from"
67,PREFATORY NOTE.,"over-study, resided at Malvern, and cared for little else than Greek"
68,PREFATORY NOTE.,"literature, especially that of the ""Fathers."" He was about or over"
69,PREFATORY NOTE.,"fifty, stooped a good deal, and was nearly bald. His daily habit was to"
70,PREFATORY NOTE.,"sit for hours before a table, treating it as a piano with his fingers,"
71,PREFATORY NOTE.,"and reciting Greek--his memory for which was such that, on a folio"
72,PREFATORY NOTE.,"column of his favourite St. Gregory being read to him, he would repeat"
73,PREFATORY NOTE.,"it without missing a syllable. Elizabeth, then residing in"
74,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Herefordshire, visited him frequently, partly from her own love of"
75,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Greek, and partly from a desire for the congenial society of one to whom"
76,PREFATORY NOTE.,her attendance might be helpful. There was nothing in the least
77,PREFATORY NOTE.,"""tutorial"" in this relation--merely the natural feeling of a girl for a"
78,PREFATORY NOTE.,blind and disabled scholar in whose pursuits she took interest. Her
79,PREFATORY NOTE.,knowledge of Greek was originally due to a preference for sharing with
80,PREFATORY NOTE.,her brother Edward in the instruction of his Scottish tutor Mr. M'Swiney
81,PREFATORY NOTE.,rather than in that of her own governess Mrs. Orme: and at such lessons
82,PREFATORY NOTE.,she constantly assisted until her brother's departure for the Charter
83,PREFATORY NOTE.,"House--where he had Thackeray for a schoolfellow. In point of fact, she"
84,PREFATORY NOTE.,was self-taught in almost every respect. Mr. Boyd was no writer of
85,PREFATORY NOTE.,"""fluent verse,"" though he published an unimportant volume, and the"
86,PREFATORY NOTE.,literary sympathies of the friends were exclusively bestowed on Greek.
87,PREFATORY NOTE.,
88,PREFATORY NOTE.,"3. ""Edward, the eldest of the family,"" was Elizabeth's younger by nearly"
89,PREFATORY NOTE.,"two years. He and his companions perished, not ""just off Teignmouth,"""
90,PREFATORY NOTE.,"but in Babbicombe Bay. The bodies drifted up channel, and were recovered"
91,PREFATORY NOTE.,three days after.
92,PREFATORY NOTE.,
93,PREFATORY NOTE.,"4. ""Her father's fortune was considerably augmented by his accession to"
94,PREFATORY NOTE.,"the property of his only brother Richard, for many years Speaker of the"
95,PREFATORY NOTE.,"House of Assembly at Jamaica."" Mr. Edward Moulton, by the will of his"
96,PREFATORY NOTE.,"grandfather, was directed to affix the name of Barrett to that of"
97,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Moulton, upon succeeding to the estates in Jamaica. Richard was his"
98,PREFATORY NOTE.,"cousin, and by his death Mr. Barrett did not acquire a shilling. His"
99,PREFATORY NOTE.,"only brother was Samuel, sometime M.P. for Richmond. He had also a"
100,PREFATORY NOTE.,"sister who died young, the full-length portrait of whom by Sir Thomas"
101,PREFATORY NOTE.,Lawrence (the first exhibited by that painter) is in the possession of
102,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Octavius Moulton-Barrett at Westover, near Calbourne, in the Isle of"
103,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Wight. With respect to the ""semi-tropical taste"" of Mr. Barrett, so"
104,PREFATORY NOTE.,"characterised in the ""Memoir,"" it may be mentioned that, on the early"
105,PREFATORY NOTE.,"death of his father, he was brought from Jamaica to England when a very"
106,PREFATORY NOTE.,"young child, as a ward of the late Chief Baron Lord Abinger, then Mr."
107,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Scarlett, whom he frequently accompanied in his post-chaise when on"
108,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Circuit. He was sent to Harrow, but received there so savage a"
109,PREFATORY NOTE.,"punishment for a supposed offence (""burning the toast"") by the youth"
110,PREFATORY NOTE.,"whose ""fag"" he had become, that he was withdrawn from the school by his"
111,PREFATORY NOTE.,"mother, and the delinquent was expelled. At the age of sixteen he was"
112,PREFATORY NOTE.,"sent by Mr. Scarlett to Cambridge, and thence, for an early marriage,"
113,PREFATORY NOTE.,"went to Northumberland. After purchasing the estate in Herefordshire, he"
114,PREFATORY NOTE.,gave himself up assiduously to the usual duties and occupations of a
115,PREFATORY NOTE.,"country gentleman,--farmed largely, was an active magistrate, became for"
116,PREFATORY NOTE.,"a year High Sheriff, and in all county contests busied himself as a"
117,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Liberal. He had a fine taste for landscape-gardening, planted"
118,PREFATORY NOTE.,"considerably, loved trees--almost as much as his friend, the early"
119,PREFATORY NOTE.,"correspondent of his daughter, Sir Uvedale Price--and for their sake"
120,PREFATORY NOTE.,discontinued keeping deer in the park.
121,PREFATORY NOTE.,
122,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Many other particulars concerning other people, in other ""Biographical"
123,PREFATORY NOTE.,"Memoirs which have appeared in England or elsewhere"" for some years"
124,PREFATORY NOTE.,"past, are similarly ""mistaken and misstated:"" but they seem better left"
125,PREFATORY NOTE.,without notice by anybody.

186,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.
187,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,
188,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,
189,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,The collection here offered to the public consists of Poems which have
190,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,been written in the interim between the period of the publication of my
191,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"""Seraphim"" and the present; variously coloured, or perhaps shadowed, by"
192,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"the life of which they are the natural expression,--and, with the"
193,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"exception of a few contributions to English or American periodicals, are"
194,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,printed now for the first time.
195,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,
196,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"As the first poem of this collection, the ""Drama of Exile,"" is the"
197,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,longest and most important work (to _me_!) which I ever trusted into the
198,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"current of publication, I may be pardoned for entreating the reader's"
199,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"attention to the fact, that I decided on publishing it after"
200,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,considerable hesitation and doubt. The subject of the Drama rather
201,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"fastened on me than was chosen; and the form, approaching the model of"
202,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"the Greek tragedy, shaped itself under my hand, rather by force of"
203,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,pleasure than of design. But when the excitement of composition had
204,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"subsided, I felt afraid of my position. My subject was the new and"
205,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"strange experience of the fallen humanity, as it went forth from"
206,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,Paradise into the wilderness; with a peculiar reference to Eve's
207,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"allotted grief, which, considering that self-sacrifice belonged to her"
208,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"womanhood, and the consciousness of originating the Fall to her"
209,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"offence,--appeared to me imperfectly apprehended hitherto, and more"
210,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"expressible by a woman than a man. There was room, at least, for lyrical"
211,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"emotion in those first steps into the wilderness,--in that first sense"
212,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"of desolation after wrath,--in that first audible gathering of the"
213,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"recriminating ""groan of the whole creation,""--in that first darkening of"
214,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"the hills from the recoiling feet of angels,--and in that first silence"
215,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"of the voice of God. And I took pleasure in driving in, like a pile,"
216,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"stroke upon stroke, the Idea of EXILE,--admitting Lucifer as an extreme"
217,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"Adam, to represent the ultimate tendencies of sin and loss,--that it"
218,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,might be strong to bear up the contrary idea of the Heavenly love and
219,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"purity. But when all was done, I felt afraid, as I said before, of my"
220,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,position. I had promised my own prudence to shut close the gates of Eden
221,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"between Milton and myself, so that none might say I dared to walk in his"
222,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"footsteps. He should be within, I thought, with his Adam and Eve"
223,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"unfallen or falling,--and I, without, with my EXILES,--_I_ also an"
224,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"exile! It would not do. The subject, and his glory covering it, swept"
225,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"through the gates, and I stood full in it, against my will, and contrary"
226,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"to my vow,--till I shrank back fearing, almost desponding; hesitating to"
227,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,venture even a passing association with our great poet before the face
228,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"of the public. Whether at last I took courage for the venture, by a"
229,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,sudden revival of that love of manuscript which should be classed by
230,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"moral philosophers among the natural affections, or by the encouraging"
231,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"voice of a dear friend, it is not interesting to the reader to inquire."
232,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"Neither could the fact affect the question; since I bear, of course, my"
233,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"own responsibilities. For the rest, Milton is too high, and I am too"
234,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"low, to render it necessary for me to disavow any rash emulation of his"
235,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,divine faculty on his own ground; while enough individuality will be
236,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"granted, I hope, to my poem, to rescue me from that imputation of"
237,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,plagiarism which should be too servile a thing for every sincere
238,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"thinker. After all, and at the worst, I have only attempted, in respect"
239,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"to Milton, what the Greek dramatists achieved lawfully in respect to"
240,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,Homer. They constructed dramas on Trojan ground; they raised on the
241,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"buskin and even clasped with the sock, the feet of Homeric heroes; yet"
242,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,they neither imitated their Homer nor emasculated him. The Agamemnon of
243,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"Æschylus, who died in the bath, did no harm to, nor suffered any harm"
244,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"from, the Agamemnon of Homer who bearded Achilles. To this analogy--the"
245,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"more favourable to me from the obvious exception in it, that Homer's"
246,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"subject was his own possibly by creation,--whereas Milton's was his own"
247,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"by illustration only,--I appeal. To this analogy--_not_ to this"
248,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"comparison, be it understood--I appeal. For the analogy of the stronger"
249,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,may apply to the weaker; and the reader may have patience with the
250,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,weakest while she suggests the application.
251,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,
252,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"On a graver point I must take leave to touch, in further reference to my"
253,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,dramatic poem. The divine Saviour is represented in vision towards the
254,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"close, speaking and transfigured; and it has been hinted to me that the"
255,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,introduction may give offence in quarters where I should be most
256,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"reluctant to give any. A reproach of the same class, relating to the"
257,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"frequent recurrence of a Great Name in my pages, has already filled me"
258,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"with regret. How shall I answer these things? Frankly, in any case. When"
259,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,the old mysteries represented the Holiest Being in a rude familiar
260,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"fashion, and the people gazed on, with the faith of children in their"
261,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"earnest eyes, the critics of a succeeding age, who rejoiced in Congreve,"
262,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"cried out ""Profane."" Yet Andreini's mystery suggested Milton's epic; and"
263,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"Milton, the most reverent of poets, doubting whether to throw his work"
264,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"into the epic form or the dramatic, left, on the latter basis, a rough"
265,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"ground-plan, in which his intention of introducing the ""Heavenly Love"""
266,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,among the persons of his drama is extant to the present day. But the
267,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,tendency of the present day is to sunder the daily life from the
268,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"spiritual creed,--to separate the worshipping from the acting man,--and"
269,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"by no means to ""live by faith."" There is a feeling abroad which appears"
270,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"to me (I say it with deference) nearer to superstition than to religion,"
271,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,that there should be no touching of holy vessels except by consecrated
272,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"fingers, nor any naming of holy names except in consecrated places. As"
273,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"if life were not a continual sacrament to man, since Christ brake the"
274,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,daily bread of it in His hands! As if the name of God did not build a
275,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"church, by the very naming of it! As if the word God were not,"
276,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"everywhere in His creation, and at every moment in His eternity, an"
277,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"appropriate word! As if it could be uttered unfitly, if devoutly! I"
278,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"appeal on these points, which I will not argue, from the conventions of"
279,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,the Christian to his devout heart; and I beseech him generously to
280,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"believe of me that I have done that in reverence from which, through"
281,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"reverence, he might have abstained; and that where he might have been"
282,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"driven to silence by the principle of adoration, I, by the very same"
283,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"principle, have been hurried into speech."
284,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,
285,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"It should have been observed in another place,--the fact, however, being"
286,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"sufficiently obvious throughout the drama,--that the time is from the"
287,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,evening into the night. If it should be objected that I have lengthened
288,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"my twilight too much for the East, I might hasten to answer that we know"
289,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"nothing of the length of mornings or evenings before the Flood, and that"
290,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"I cannot, for my own part, believe in an Eden without the longest of"
291,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"purple twilights. The evening, =erev=, of Genesis signifies a"
292,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"""mingling,"" and approaches the meaning of our ""twilight"" analytically."
293,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"Apart from which considerations, my ""exiles"" are surrounded, in the"
294,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"scene described, by supernatural appearances; and the shadows that"
295,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,approach them are not only of the night.
296,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,
297,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"The next longest poem to the ""Drama of Exile,"" in the collection, is the"
298,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"""Vision of Poets,"" in which I have endeavoured to indicate the necessary"
299,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,relations of genius to suffering and self-sacrifice. In the eyes of the
300,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"living generation, the poet is at once a richer and poorer man than he"
301,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"used to be; he wears better broadcloth, but speaks no more oracles: and"
302,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,the evil of this social incrustation over a great idea is eating deeper
303,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,and more fatally into our literature than either readers or writers may
304,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,apprehend fully. I have attempted to express in this poem my view of the
305,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"mission of the poet, of the self-abnegation implied in it, of the great"
306,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"work involved in it, of the duty and glory of what Balzac has"
307,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"beautifully and truly called ""la patience angélique du génie;"" and of"
308,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"the obvious truth, above all, that if knowledge is power, suffering"
309,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,should be acceptable as a part of knowledge. It is enough to say of the
310,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"other poems, that scarcely one of them is unambitious of an object and a"
311,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,significance.
312,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,
313,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"Since my ""Seraphim"" was received by the public with more kindness than"
314,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"its writer had counted on, I dare not rely on having put away the faults"
315,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,with which that volume abounded and was mildly reproached. Something
316,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"indeed I may hope to have retrieved, because some progress in mind and"
317,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,in art every active thinker and honest writer must consciously or
318,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"unconsciously make, with the progress of existence and experience: and,"
319,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"in some sort--since ""we learn in suffering what we teach in song,""--my"
320,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,songs may be fitter to teach. But if it were not presumptuous language
321,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"on the lips of one to whom life is more than usually uncertain, my"
322,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"favourite wish for this work would be, that it be received by the public"
323,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"as a step in the right track, towards a future indication of more value"
324,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"and acceptability. I would fain do better,--and I feel as if I might do"
325,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,better: I aspire to do better. It is no new form of the nympholepsy of
326,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"poetry, that my ideal should fly before me:--and if I cry out too"
327,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"hopefully at sight of the white vesture receding between the cypresses,"
328,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"let me be blamed gently if justly. In any case, while my poems are full"
329,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"of faults,--as I go forward to my critics and confess,--they have my"
330,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"heart and life in them,--they are not empty shells. If it must be said"
331,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,of me that I have contributed immemorable verses to the many rejected by
332,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"the age, it cannot at least be said that I have done so in a light and"
333,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,irresponsible spirit. Poetry has been as serious a thing to me as life
334,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,itself; and life has been a very serious thing: there has been no
335,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,playing at skittles for me in either. I never mistook pleasure for the
336,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"final cause of poetry; nor leisure, for the hour of the poet. I have"
337,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"done my work, so far, as work,--not as mere hand and head work, apart"
338,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"from the personal being,--but as the completest expression of that being"
339,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"to which I could attain,--and as work I offer it to the public,--feeling"
340,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"its shortcomings more deeply than any of my readers, because measured"
341,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,"from the height of my aspiration,--but feeling also that the reverence"
342,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,and sincerity with which the work was done should give it some
343,TO THE FIRST COLLECTED EDITION OF MRS. BROWNING'S POEMS.,protection with the reverent and sincere.

584,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Gabriel._ Thou speakest in the shadow of thy change.
585,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,If thou hadst gazed upon the face of God
586,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"This morning for a moment, thou hadst known"
587,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,That only pity fitly can chastise:
588,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Hate but avenges.
589,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
590,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Lucifer._        As it is, I know"
591,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Something of pity. When I reeled in heaven,"
592,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"And my sword grew too heavy for my grasp,"
593,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Stabbing through matter, which it could not pierce"
594,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"So much as the first shell of,--toward the throne;"
595,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"When I fell back, down,--staring up as I fell,--"
596,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"The lightnings holding open my scathed lids,"
597,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"And that thought of the infinite of God,"
598,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Hurled after to precipitate descent;
599,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,When countless angel faces still and stern
600,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Pressed out upon me from the level heavens
601,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Adown the abysmal spaces, and I fell"
602,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Trampled down by your stillness, and struck blind"
603,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"By the sight within your eyes,--'twas then I knew"
604,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"How ye could pity, my kind angelhood!"
605,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
606,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Gabriel._ Alas, discrowned one, by the truth in me"
607,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Which God keeps in me, I would give away"
608,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"All--save that truth and his love keeping it,--"
609,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,To lead thee home again into the light
610,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"And hear thy voice chant with the morning stars,"
611,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,When their rays tremble round them with much song
612,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Sung in more gladness!
613,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
614,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Lucifer._                 Sing, my Morning Star!"
615,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Last beautiful, last heavenly, that I loved!"
616,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"If I could drench thy golden locks with tears,"
617,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,What were it to this angel?
618,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
619,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Gabriel._                   What love is.
620,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,And now I have named God.
621,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
622,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Lucifer._                    Yet, Gabriel,"
623,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"By the lie in me which I keep myself,"
624,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Thou'rt a false swearer. Were it otherwise,"
625,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"What dost thou here, vouchsafing tender thoughts"
626,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"To that earth-angel or earth-demon--which,"
627,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Thou and I have not solved the problem yet
628,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Enough to argue,--that fallen Adam there,--"
629,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"That red-clay and a breath,--who must, forsooth,"
630,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Live in a new apocalypse of sense,"
631,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,With beauty and music waving in his trees
632,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"And running in his rivers, to make glad"
633,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"His soul made perfect?--is it not for hope,"
634,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"A hope within thee deeper than thy truth,"
635,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Of finally conducting him and his
636,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"To fill the vacant thrones of me and mine,"
637,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Which affront heaven with their vacuity?
638,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
639,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Gabriel._ Angel, there are no vacant thrones in heaven"
640,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,To suit thy empty words. Glory and life
641,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Fulfil their own depletions; and if God
642,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Sighed you far from him, his next breath drew in"
643,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"A compensative splendour up the vast,"
644,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Flushing the starry arteries.
645,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
646,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Lucifer._                 What a change!
647,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"So, let the vacant thrones and gardens too"
648,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Fill as may please you!--and be pitiful,"
649,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"As ye translate that word, to the dethroned"
650,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"And exiled, man or angel. The fact stands,"
651,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"That I, the rebel, the cast out and down,"
652,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Am here and will not go; while there, along"
653,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"The light to which ye flash the desert out,"
654,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Flies your adopted Adam, your red-clay"
655,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"In two kinds, both being flawed. Why, what is this?"
656,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Whose work is this? Whose hand was in the work?
657,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Against whose hand? In this last strife, methinks,"
658,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,I am not a fallen angel!
659,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
660,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Gabriel._                 Dost thou know
661,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Aught of those exiles?
662,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
663,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Lucifer._                Ay: I know they have fled
664,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Silent all day along the wilderness:
665,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"I know they wear, for burden on their backs,"
666,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"The thought of a shut gate of Paradise,"
667,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,And faces of the marshalled cherubim
668,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Shining against, not for them; and I know"
669,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"They dare not look in one another's face,--"
670,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,As if each were a cherub!
671,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
672,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Gabriel._                 Dost thou know
673,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Aught of their future?
674,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
675,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Lucifer._              Only as much as this:
676,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,That evil will increase and multiply
677,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Without a benediction.
678,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
679,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Gabriel._                Nothing more?
680,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
681,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Lucifer._ Why so the angels taunt! What should be more?
682,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
683,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Gabriel._ God is more.
684,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
685,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Lucifer._               Proving what?
686,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
687,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Gabriel._                             That he is God,"
688,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"And capable of saving. Lucifer,"
689,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,I charge thee by the solitude he kept
690,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Ere he created,--leave the earth to God!"
691,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
692,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Lucifer._ My foot is on the earth, firm as my sin."
693,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
694,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Gabriel._ I charge thee by the memory of heaven
695,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Ere any sin was done,--leave earth to God!"
696,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
697,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Lucifer._ My sin is on the earth, to reign thereon."
698,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
699,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Gabriel._ I charge thee by the choral song we sang,"
700,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,When up against the white shore of our feet
701,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"The depths of the creation swelled and brake,--"
702,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"And the new worlds, the beaded foam and flower"
703,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Of all that coil, roared outward into space"
704,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"On thunder-edges,--leave the earth to God!"
705,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
706,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"_Lucifer._ My woe is on the earth, to curse thereby."
707,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
708,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Gabriel._ I charge thee by that mournful Morning Star
709,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Which trembles ...
710,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,
711,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,_Lucifer._             Enough spoken. As the pine
712,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,In norland forest drops its weight of snows
713,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"By a night's growth, so, growing toward my ends"
714,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"I drop thy counsels. Farewell, Gabriel!"
715,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Watch out thy service; I achieve my will.
716,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"And peradventure in the after years,"
717,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,When thoughtful men shall bend their spacious brows
718,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,Upon the storm and strife seen everywhere
719,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,To ruffle their smooth manhood and break up
720,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,With lurid lights of intermittent hope
721,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,"Their human fear and wrong,--they may discern"
722,A DRAMA OF EXILE.,The heart of a lost angel in the earth.

952,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And thine undoer, as the snake was mine,--"
953,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"I do adjure thee, put me straight away,"
954,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Together with my name! Sweet, punish me!"
955,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"O Love, be just! and, ere we pass beyond"
956,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"The light cast outward by the fiery sword,"
957,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Into the dark which earth must be to us,"
958,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Bruise my head with thy foot,--as the curse said"
959,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"My seed shall the first tempter's! strike with curse,"
960,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"As God struck in the garden! and as HE,"
961,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Being satisfied with justice and with wrath,"
962,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Did roll his thunder gentler at the close,--"
963,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Thou, peradventure, mayst at last recoil"
964,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"To some soft need of mercy. Strike, my lord!"
965,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_I_, also, after tempting, writhe on the ground,"
966,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And I would feed on ashes from thine hand,"
967,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"As suits me, O my tempted!"
968,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
969,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_Adam._                      My beloved,"
970,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Mine Eve and life--I have no other name
971,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"For thee or for the sun than what ye are,"
972,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"My utter life and light! If we have fallen,"
973,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"It is that we have sinned,--we: God is just;"
974,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And, since his curse doth comprehend us both,"
975,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,It must be that his balance holds the weights
976,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Of first and last sin on a level. What!
977,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Shall I who had not virtue to stand straight
978,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Among the hills of Eden, here assume"
979,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"To mend the justice of the perfect God,"
980,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"By piling up a curse upon his curse,"
981,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Against thee--thee?
982,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
983,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_Eve._                For so, perchance, thy God,"
984,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Might take thee into grace for scorning me;
985,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Thy wrath against the sinner giving proof
986,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Of inward abrogation of the sin:
987,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And so, the blessed angels might come down"
988,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And walk with thee as erst,--I think they would,--"
989,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Because I was not near to make them sad
990,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Or soil the rustling of their innocence.
991,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
992,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_Adam._ They know me. I am deepest in the guilt,"
993,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,If last in the transgression.
994,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
995,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,_Eve._                Thou!
996,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
997,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_Adam._                            If God,"
998,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Who gave the right and joyaunce of the world
999,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Both unto thee and me,--gave thee to me,"
1000,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"The best gift last, the last sin was the worst,"
1001,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Which sinned against more complement of gifts
1002,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,And grace of giving. God! I render back
1003,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Strong benediction and perpetual praise
1004,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"From mortal feeble lips (as incense-smoke,"
1005,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Out of a little censer, may fill heaven),"
1006,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"That thou, in striking my benumbèd hands"
1007,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,And forcing them to drop all other boons
1008,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Of beauty and dominion and delight,--"
1009,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Hast left this well-beloved Eve, this life"
1010,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Within life, this best gift between their palms,"
1011,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,In gracious compensation!
1012,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1013,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,_Eve._                       Is it thy voice?
1014,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Or some saluting angel's--calling home
1015,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,My feet into the garden?
1016,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1017,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,_Adam._                    O my God!
1018,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"I, standing here between the glory and dark,--"
1019,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,The glory of thy wrath projected forth
1020,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"From Eden's wall, the dark of our distress"
1021,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Which settles a step off in that drear world--
1022,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Lift up to thee the hands from whence hath fallen
1023,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Only creation's sceptre,--thanking thee"
1024,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,That rather thou hast cast me out with _her_
1025,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Than left me lorn of her in Paradise,"
1026,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,With angel looks and angel songs around
1027,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"To show the absence of her eyes and voice,"
1028,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,And make society full desertness
1029,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Without her use in comfort!
1030,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1031,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,_Eve._                     Where is loss?
1032,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Am I in Eden? can another speak
1033,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Mine own love's tongue?
1034,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1035,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_Adam._                     Because with _her_, I stand"
1036,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Upright, as far as can be in this fall,"
1037,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And look away from heaven which doth accuse,"
1038,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And look away from earth which doth convict,"
1039,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Into her face, and crown my discrowned brow"
1040,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Out of her love, and put the thought of her"
1041,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Around me, for an Eden full of birds,"
1042,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And lift her body up--thus--to my heart,"
1043,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And with my lips upon her lips,--thus, thus,--"
1044,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Do quicken and sublimate my mortal breath
1045,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Which cannot climb against the grave's steep sides
1046,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,But overtops this grief.
1047,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1048,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,_Eve._                   I am renewed.
1049,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,My eyes grow with the light which is in thine;
1050,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,The silence of my heart is full of sound.
1051,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Hold me up--so! Because I comprehend
1052,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"This human love, I shall not be afraid"
1053,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Of any human death; and yet because
1054,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"I know this strength of love, I seem to know"
1055,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Death's strength by that same sign. Kiss on my lips,"
1056,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"To shut the door close on my rising soul,--"
1057,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Lest it pass outwards in astonishment
1058,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,And leave thee lonely!
1059,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1060,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_Adam._                   Yet thou liest, Eve,"
1061,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Bent heavily on thyself across mine arm,"
1062,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Thy face flat to the sky.
1063,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1064,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_Eve._                    Ay, and the tears"
1065,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Running, as it might seem, my life from me,"
1066,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"They run so fast and warm. Let me lie so,"
1067,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And weep so, as if in a dream or prayer,"
1068,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Unfastening, clasp by clasp, the hard tight thought"
1069,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Which clipped my heart and showed me evermore
1070,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Loathed of thy justice as I loathe the snake,"
1071,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And as the pure ones loathe our sin. To-day,"
1072,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"All day, beloved, as we fled across"
1073,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,This desolating radiance cast by swords
1074,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Not suns,--my lips prayed soundless to myself,"
1075,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Striking against each other--""O Lord God!"""
1076,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"('Twas so I prayed) ""I ask Thee by my sin,"
1077,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""And by thy curse, and by thy blameless heavens,"
1078,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""Make dreadful haste to hide me from thy face"
1079,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""And from the face of my beloved here"
1080,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""For whom I am no helpmeet, quick away"
1081,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""Into the new dark mystery of death!"
1082,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""I will lie still there, I will make no plaint,"
1083,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""I will not sigh, nor sob, nor speak a word,"
1084,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""Nor struggle to come back beneath the sun"
1085,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""Where peradventure I might sin anew"
1086,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""Against thy mercy and his pleasure. Death,"
1087,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""O death, whatever it be, is good enough"
1088,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""For such as I am: while for Adam here,"
1089,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""No voice shall say again, in heaven or earth,"
1090,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"""_It is not good for him to be alone_."""
1091,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1092,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_Adam._ And was it good for such a prayer to pass,"
1093,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"My unkind Eve, betwixt our mutual lives?"
1094,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"If I am exiled, must I be bereaved?"
1095,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1096,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,_Eve._ 'Twas an ill prayer: it shall be prayed no more;
1097,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And God did use it like a foolishness,"
1098,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Giving no answer. Now my heart has grown
1099,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Too high and strong for such a foolish prayer,"
1100,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Love makes it strong and since I was the first
1101,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"In the transgression, with a steady foot"
1102,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,I will be first to tread from this sword-glare
1103,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Into the outer darkness of the waste,--"
1104,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,And thus I do it.
1105,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1106,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"_Adam._            Thus I follow thee,"
1107,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,As erewhile in the sin.--What sounds! what sounds!
1108,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"I feel a music which comes straight from heaven,"
1109,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,As tender as a watering dew.
1110,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,
1111,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,_Eve._                        I think
1112,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"That angels--not those guarding Paradise,--"
1113,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"But the love-angels, who came erst to us,"
1114,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"And when we said 'GOD,' fainted unawares"
1115,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"Back from our mortal presence unto God,"
1116,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,(As if he drew them inward in a breath)
1117,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"His name being heard of them,--I think that they"
1118,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,"With sliding voices lean from heavenly towers,"
1119,CHORUS OF EDEN SPIRITS,Invisible but gracious. Hark--how soft!

1129,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Smoothly to unravel
1130,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,All that web of pain
1131,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Wherein ye are holden.
1132,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Do ye know our voices
1133,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Chanting down the Golden?
1134,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Do ye guess our choice is,"
1135,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Being unbeholden,"
1136,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,To be hearkened by you yet again?
1137,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1138,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,This pure door of opal

1149,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,_First Semichorus._
1150,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Think how erst your Eden,"
1151,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Day on day succeeding,"
1152,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,With our presence glowed.
1153,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,We came as if the Heavens were bowed
1154,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,To a milder music rare.
1155,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Ye saw us in our solemn treading,"
1156,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Treading down the steps of cloud,"
1157,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"While our wings, outspreading"
1158,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Double calms of whiteness,"
1159,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Dropped superfluous brightness
1160,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Down from stair to stair.
1161,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1162,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,_Second Semichorus._
1163,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Or oft, abrupt though tender,"
1164,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"While ye gazed on space,"
1165,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,We flashed our angel-splendour
1166,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,In either human face.
1167,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"With mystic lilies in our hands,"
1168,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,From the atmospheric bands
1169,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Breaking with a sudden grace,"
1170,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,We took you unaware!
1171,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,While our feet struck glories
1172,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Outward, smooth and fair,"
1173,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Which we stood on floorwise,"
1174,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Platformed in mid-air.
1175,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1176,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,_First Semichorus._
1177,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Or oft, when Heaven-descended,"
1178,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Stood we in our wondering sight
1179,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,In a mute apocalypse
1180,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,With dumb vibrations on our lips
1181,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"From hosannas ended,"
1182,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,And grand half-vanishings
1183,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Of the empyreal things
1184,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Within our eyes belated,"
1185,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Till the heavenly Infinite
1186,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Falling off from the Created,"
1187,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Left our inward contemplation
1188,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Opened into ministration.
1189,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1190,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,_Chorus._
1191,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Then upon our axle turning
1192,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Of great joy to sympathy,"
1193,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,We sang out the morning
1194,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Broadening up the sky,"
1195,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Or we drew
1196,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Our music through
1197,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"The noontide's hush and heat and shine,"
1198,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Informed with our intense Divine:
1199,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Interrupted vital notes
1200,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Palpitating hither, thither,"
1201,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Burning out into the æther,"
1202,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Sensible like fiery motes.
1203,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Or, whenever twilight drifted"
1204,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Through the cedar masses,"
1205,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"The globèd sun we lifted,"
1206,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Trailing purple, trailing gold"
1207,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Out between the passes
1208,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Of the mountains manifold,"
1209,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,To anthems slowly sung:
1210,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"While he,--aweary, half in swoon"
1211,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,For joy to hear our climbing tune
1212,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Transpierce the stars' concentric rings,--"
1213,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,The burden of his glory flung
1214,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,In broken lights upon our wings.

1223,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,My right hand strongly! It is Lucifer--
1224,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,And we have love to lose.
1225,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1226,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"_Adam._                   I' the name of God,"
1227,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Go apart from us, O thou Lucifer!"
1228,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,And leave us to the desert thou hast made
1229,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Out of thy treason. Bring no serpent-slime
1230,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Athwart this path kept holy to our tears!
1231,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Or we may curse thee with their bitterness.
1232,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1233,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"_Lucifer._ Curse freely! curses thicken. Why, this Eve"
1234,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Who thought me once part worthy of her ear
1235,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"And somewhat wiser than the other beasts,--"
1236,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Drawing together her large globes of eyes,"
1237,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,The light of which is throbbing in and out
1238,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Their steadfast continuity of gaze,--"
1239,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Knots her fair eyebrows in so hard a knot,"
1240,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,And down from her white heights of womanhood
1241,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Looks on me so amazed,--I scarce should fear"
1242,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,To wager such an apple as she plucked
1243,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Against one riper from the tree of life,"
1244,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,That she could curse too--as a woman may--
1245,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Smooth in the vowels.
1246,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1247,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,_Eve._                   So--speak wickedly!
1248,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"I like it best so. Let thy words be wounds,--"
1249,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"For, so, I shall not fear thy power to hurt."
1250,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Trench on the forms of good by open ill--
1251,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"For, so, I shall wax strong and grand with scorn,"
1252,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Scorning myself for ever trusting thee
1253,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"As far as thinking, ere a snake ate dust,"
1254,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,He could speak wisdom.
1255,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1256,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"_Lucifer._                Our new gods, it seems,"
1257,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Deal more in thunders than in courtesies.
1258,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"And, sooth, mine own Olympus, which anon"
1259,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,I shall build up to loud-voiced imagery
1260,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"From all the wandering visions of the world,"
1261,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,May show worse railing than our lady Eve
1262,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Pours o'er the rounding of her argent arm.
1263,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,But why should this be? Adam pardoned Eve.
1264,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1265,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,_Adam._ Adam loved Eve. Jehovah pardon both!
1266,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1267,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,_Eve._ Adam forgave Eve--because loving Eve.
1268,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1269,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"_Lucifer._ So, well. Yet Adam was undone of Eve,"
1270,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"As both were by the snake. Therefore forgive,"
1271,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"In like wise, fellow-temptress, the poor snake--"
1272,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Who stung there, not so poorly!"

1278,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"For this time he speaks truth, which we should hear,"
1279,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"And asks for mercy, which I most should grant,"

1281,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"And therefore I thee pardon, Lucifer,"
1282,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,As freely as the streams of Eden flowed
1283,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"When we were happy by them. So, depart;"
1284,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Leave us to walk the remnant of our time
1285,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Out mildly in the desert. Do not seek
1286,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"To harm us any more or scoff at us,"
1287,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Or ere the dust be laid upon our face,"
1288,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,To find there the communion of the dust
1289,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"And issue of the dust,--Go!"
1290,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1291,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"_Adam._                    At once, go!"
1292,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,

1313,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,_Lucifer._             And why of God?
1314,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,
1315,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"_Adam._ It were no crown else. Verily, I think"

1383,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Unwillingly but fully, that I stand"
1384,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Most absolute in beauty. As yourselves

1386,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,Sprang very beauteous from the creant Word
1387,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Which thrilled behind us, God himself being moved"
1388,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"When that august work of a perfect shape,"
1389,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"His dignities of sovran angel-hood,"
1390,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Swept out into the universe,--divine"
1391,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"With thunderous movements, earnest looks of gods,"
1392,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,And silver-solemn clash of cymbal wings.
1393,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Whereof was I, in motion and in form,"
1394,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"A part not poorest. And yet,--yet, perhaps,"
1395,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"This beauty which I speak of, is not here,"
1396,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"As God's voice is not here, nor even my crown--"

1410,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"The consummation to the inward sense,"

1414,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"Without its black and green, being all a blank,--"
1415,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,"So, without love, is beauty undiscerned"

1421,CHORUS OF INVISIBLE ANGELS.,_Lucifer._ Love! what is love? I lose it. Beauty and love

3430,PART THE FIRST.,"Straightway how thine own would wither,"
3431,PART THE FIRST.,"Falter like a human breath,"
3432,PART THE FIRST.,"And shrink into a point like death,"
3433,PART THE FIRST.,By gazing on its source!--
3434,PART THE FIRST.,My words have imaged dread
3435,PART THE FIRST.,"Meekly hast thou bent thine head,"
3436,PART THE FIRST.,And dropt thy wings in languishment:
3437,PART THE FIRST.,"Overclouding foot and face,"
3438,PART THE FIRST.,As if God's throne were eminent
3439,PART THE FIRST.,"Before thee, in the place."
3440,PART THE FIRST.,"Yet not--not so,"
3441,PART THE FIRST.,"O loving spirit and meek, dost thou fulfil"
3442,PART THE FIRST.,The supreme Will.
3443,PART THE FIRST.,"Not for obeisance but obedience,"
3444,PART THE FIRST.,Give motion to thy wings! Depart from hence!
3445,PART THE FIRST.,"The voice said ""Go!"""
3446,PART THE FIRST.,
3447,PART THE FIRST.,"_Zerah._ Beloved, I depart,"
3448,PART THE FIRST.,"His will is as a spirit within my spirit,"
3449,PART THE FIRST.,A portion of the being I inherit.
3450,PART THE FIRST.,His will is mine obedience. I resemble
3451,PART THE FIRST.,A flame all undefilèd though it tremble;
3452,PART THE FIRST.,"I go and tremble. Love me, O beloved!"
3453,PART THE FIRST.,"O thou, who stronger art,"
3454,PART THE FIRST.,"And standest ever near the Infinite,"
3455,PART THE FIRST.,"Pale with the light of Light,"
3456,PART THE FIRST.,"Love me, beloved! me, more newly made,"
3457,PART THE FIRST.,"More feeble, more afraid;"
3458,PART THE FIRST.,"And let me hear with mine thy pinions moved,"
3459,PART THE FIRST.,"As close and gentle as the loving are,"
3460,PART THE FIRST.,"That love being near, heaven may not seem so far."
3461,PART THE FIRST.,
3462,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._ I am near thee and I love thee.
3463,PART THE FIRST.,"Were I loveless, from thee gone,"
3464,PART THE FIRST.,"Love is round, beneath, above thee,"
3465,PART THE FIRST.,"God, the omnipresent one."
3466,PART THE FIRST.,Spread the wing and lift the brow!
3467,PART THE FIRST.,"Well-beloved, what fearest thou?"
3468,PART THE FIRST.,
3469,PART THE FIRST.,"_Zerah._ I fear, I fear--"
3470,PART THE FIRST.,
3471,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._                What fear?
3472,PART THE FIRST.,
3473,PART THE FIRST.,_Zerah._                        The fear of earth.
3474,PART THE FIRST.,
3475,PART THE FIRST.,"_Ador._ Of earth, the God-created and God-praised"
3476,PART THE FIRST.,In the hour of birth?
3477,PART THE FIRST.,Where every night the moon in light
3478,PART THE FIRST.,Doth lead the waters silver-faced?
3479,PART THE FIRST.,Where every day the sun doth lay
3480,PART THE FIRST.,A rapture to the heart of all
3481,PART THE FIRST.,"The leafy and reeded pastoral,"
3482,PART THE FIRST.,As if the joyous shout which burst
3483,PART THE FIRST.,"From angel lips to see him first,"
3484,PART THE FIRST.,Had left a silent echo in his ray?
3485,PART THE FIRST.,
3486,PART THE FIRST.,"_Zerah._ Of earth--the God-created and God-curst,"
3487,PART THE FIRST.,"Where man is, and the thorn:"
3488,PART THE FIRST.,Where sun and moon have borne
3489,PART THE FIRST.,No light to souls forlorn:
3490,PART THE FIRST.,Where Eden's tree of life no more uprears
3491,PART THE FIRST.,"Its spiral leaves and fruitage, but instead"
3492,PART THE FIRST.,The yew-tree bows its melancholy head
3493,PART THE FIRST.,And all the undergrasses kills and seres.
3494,PART THE FIRST.,
3495,PART THE FIRST.,"_Ador._ Of earth the weak,"
3496,PART THE FIRST.,Made and unmade?
3497,PART THE FIRST.,"Where men, that faint, do strive for crowns that fade?"
3498,PART THE FIRST.,"Where, having won the profit which they seek,"
3499,PART THE FIRST.,They lie beside the sceptre and the gold
3500,PART THE FIRST.,"With fleshless hands that cannot wield or hold,"
3501,PART THE FIRST.,And the stars shine in their unwinking eyes?
3502,PART THE FIRST.,
3503,PART THE FIRST.,"_Zerah._ Of earth the bold,"
3504,PART THE FIRST.,Where the blind matter wrings
3505,PART THE FIRST.,"An awful potence out of impotence,"
3506,PART THE FIRST.,Bowing the spiritual things
3507,PART THE FIRST.,To the things of sense.
3508,PART THE FIRST.,Where the human will replies
3509,PART THE FIRST.,"With ay and no,"
3510,PART THE FIRST.,Because the human pulse is quick or slow.
3511,PART THE FIRST.,"Where Love succumbs to Change,"
3512,PART THE FIRST.,"With only his own memories, for revenge."
3513,PART THE FIRST.,And the fearful mystery--
3514,PART THE FIRST.,
3515,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._                      called Death?
3516,PART THE FIRST.,
3517,PART THE FIRST.,"_Zerah._ Nay, death is fearful,--but who saith"
3518,PART THE FIRST.,"""To die,"" is comprehensible."
3519,PART THE FIRST.,"What's fearfuller, thou knowest well,"
3520,PART THE FIRST.,"Though the utterance be not for thee,"
3521,PART THE FIRST.,Lest it blanch thy lips from glory--
3522,PART THE FIRST.,Ay! the cursed thing that moved
3523,PART THE FIRST.,"A shadow of ill, long time ago,"
3524,PART THE FIRST.,"Across our heaven's own shining floor,"
3525,PART THE FIRST.,"And when it vanished, some who were"
3526,PART THE FIRST.,"On thrones of holy empire there,"

3528,PART THE FIRST.,"Come nearer, O beloved!"
3529,PART THE FIRST.,
3530,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._ I am near thee. Didst thou bear thee
3531,PART THE FIRST.,Ever to this earth?
3532,PART THE FIRST.,
3533,PART THE FIRST.,_Zerah._                Before.
3534,PART THE FIRST.,When thrilling from His hand along
3535,PART THE FIRST.,Its lustrous path with spheric song
3536,PART THE FIRST.,"The earth was deathless, sorrowless."
3537,PART THE FIRST.,"Unfearing, then, pure feet might press"
3538,PART THE FIRST.,"The grasses brightening with their feet,"
3539,PART THE FIRST.,For God's own voice did mix its sound
3540,PART THE FIRST.,In a solemn confluence oft
3541,PART THE FIRST.,"With the rivers' flowing round,"
3542,PART THE FIRST.,And the life-tree's waving soft.
3543,PART THE FIRST.,Beautiful new earth and strange!
3544,PART THE FIRST.,
3545,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._ Hast thou seen it since--the change?
3546,PART THE FIRST.,
3547,PART THE FIRST.,"_Zerah._ Nay, or wherefore should I fear"
3548,PART THE FIRST.,To look upon it now?
3549,PART THE FIRST.,I have beheld the ruined things
3550,PART THE FIRST.,Only in depicturings
3551,PART THE FIRST.,"Of angels from an earthly mission,--"
3552,PART THE FIRST.,"Strong one, even upon thy brow,"
3553,PART THE FIRST.,"When, with task completed, given"
3554,PART THE FIRST.,"Back to us in that transition,"
3555,PART THE FIRST.,"I have beheld thee silent stand,"
3556,PART THE FIRST.,"Abstracted in the seraph band,"
3557,PART THE FIRST.,Without a smile in heaven.
3558,PART THE FIRST.,
3559,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._ Then thou wast not one of those
3560,PART THE FIRST.,Whom the loving Father chose
3561,PART THE FIRST.,In visionary pomp to sweep
3562,PART THE FIRST.,"O'er Judæa's grassy places,"
3563,PART THE FIRST.,"O'er the shepherds and the sheep,"
3564,PART THE FIRST.,Though thou art so tender?--dimming
3565,PART THE FIRST.,All the stars except one star
3566,PART THE FIRST.,"With their brighter kinder faces,"
3567,PART THE FIRST.,"And using heaven's own tune in hymning,"
3568,PART THE FIRST.,"While deep response from earth's own mountains ran,"
3569,PART THE FIRST.,"""Peace upon earth, goodwill to man."""
3570,PART THE FIRST.,
3571,PART THE FIRST.,"_Zerah._ ""Glory to God."" I said amen afar."
3572,PART THE FIRST.,"And those who from that earthly mission are,"
3573,PART THE FIRST.,Within mine ears have told
3574,PART THE FIRST.,That the seven everlasting Spirits did hold
3575,PART THE FIRST.,With such a sweet and prodigal constraint
3576,PART THE FIRST.,The meaning yet the mystery of the song
3577,PART THE FIRST.,"What time they sang it, on their natures strong,"
3578,PART THE FIRST.,"That, gazing down on earth's dark steadfastness"
3579,PART THE FIRST.,"And speaking the new peace in promises,"
3580,PART THE FIRST.,The love and pity made their voices faint
3581,PART THE FIRST.,"Into the low and tender music, keeping"
3582,PART THE FIRST.,The place in heaven of what on earth is weeping.
3583,PART THE FIRST.,
3584,PART THE FIRST.,"_Ador._ ""Peace upon earth."" Come down to it."
3585,PART THE FIRST.,
3586,PART THE FIRST.,_Zerah._                              Ah me!
3587,PART THE FIRST.,I hear thereof uncomprehendingly.
3588,PART THE FIRST.,"Peace where the tempest, where the sighing is,"
3589,PART THE FIRST.,"And worship of the idol, 'stead of His?"
3590,PART THE FIRST.,
3591,PART THE FIRST.,"_Ador._ Yea, peace, where He is."
3592,PART THE FIRST.,
3593,PART THE FIRST.,_Zerah._                        He!
3594,PART THE FIRST.,Say it again.
3595,PART THE FIRST.,
3596,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._       Where He is.
3597,PART THE FIRST.,
3598,PART THE FIRST.,_Zerah._                   Can it be
3599,PART THE FIRST.,That earth retains a tree
3600,PART THE FIRST.,"Whose leaves, like Eden foliage, can be swayed"
3601,PART THE FIRST.,"By the breathing of His voice, nor shrink and fade?"
3602,PART THE FIRST.,
3603,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._ There is a tree!--it hath no leaf nor root;
3604,PART THE FIRST.,Upon it hangs a curse for all its fruit:
3605,PART THE FIRST.,Its shadow on his head is laid.
3606,PART THE FIRST.,"For he, the crownèd Son,"
3607,PART THE FIRST.,"Has left his crown and throne,"
3608,PART THE FIRST.,"Walks earth in Adam's clay,"
3609,PART THE FIRST.,Eve's snake to bruise and slay--
3610,PART THE FIRST.,
3611,PART THE FIRST.,_Zerah._ Walks earth in clay?
3612,PART THE FIRST.,
3613,PART THE FIRST.,"_Ador._ And walking in the clay which he created,"
3614,PART THE FIRST.,He through it shall touch death.
3615,PART THE FIRST.,What do I utter? what conceive? did breath
3616,PART THE FIRST.,Of demon howl it in a blasphemy?
3617,PART THE FIRST.,"Or was it mine own voice, informed, dilated"
3618,PART THE FIRST.,By the seven confluent Spirits?--Speak--answer me!
3619,PART THE FIRST.,
3620,PART THE FIRST.,_Who_ said man's victim was his deity?
3621,PART THE FIRST.,
3622,PART THE FIRST.,"_Zerah._ Beloved, beloved, the word came forth from thee."
3623,PART THE FIRST.,Thine eyes are rolling a tempestuous light
3624,PART THE FIRST.,"Above, below, around,"
3625,PART THE FIRST.,"As putting thunder-questions without cloud,"
3626,PART THE FIRST.,"Reverberate without sound,"
3627,PART THE FIRST.,To universal nature's depth and height.
3628,PART THE FIRST.,The tremor of an inexpressive thought
3629,PART THE FIRST.,"Too self-amazed to shape itself aloud,"
3630,PART THE FIRST.,O'erruns the awful curving of thy lips;
3631,PART THE FIRST.,"And while thine hands are stretched above,"
3632,PART THE FIRST.,As newly they had caught
3633,PART THE FIRST.,"Some lightning from the Throne, or showed the Lord"
3634,PART THE FIRST.,"Some retributive sword,"
3635,PART THE FIRST.,Thy brows do alternate with wild eclipse
3636,PART THE FIRST.,"And radiance, with contrasted wrath and love,"
3637,PART THE FIRST.,"As God had called thee to a seraph's part,"
3638,PART THE FIRST.,With a man's quailing heart.
3639,PART THE FIRST.,
3640,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._ O heart--O heart of man!
3641,PART THE FIRST.,O ta'en from human clay
3642,PART THE FIRST.,To be no seraph's but Jehovah's own!
3643,PART THE FIRST.,"Made holy in the taking,"
3644,PART THE FIRST.,And yet unseparate
3645,PART THE FIRST.,"From death's perpetual ban,"
3646,PART THE FIRST.,And human feelings sad and passionate:
3647,PART THE FIRST.,Still subject to the treacherous forsaking
3648,PART THE FIRST.,"Of other hearts, and its own steadfast pain."
3649,PART THE FIRST.,O heart of man--of God! which God has ta'en
3650,PART THE FIRST.,"From out the dust, with its humanity"
3651,PART THE FIRST.,"Mournful and weak yet innocent around it,"
3652,PART THE FIRST.,And bade its many pulses beating lie
3653,PART THE FIRST.,Beside that incommunicable stir
3654,PART THE FIRST.,Of Deity wherewith he interwound it.
3655,PART THE FIRST.,O man! and is thy nature so defiled
3656,PART THE FIRST.,"That all that holy Heart's devout law-keeping,"
3657,PART THE FIRST.,"And low pathetic beat in deserts wild,"
3658,PART THE FIRST.,And gushings pitiful of tender weeping
3659,PART THE FIRST.,For traitors who consigned it to such woe--
3660,PART THE FIRST.,"That all could cleanse thee not, without the flow"
3661,PART THE FIRST.,"Of blood, the life-blood--_His_--and streaming _so_?"
3662,PART THE FIRST.,"O earth the thundercleft, windshaken, where"
3663,PART THE FIRST.,"The louder voice of ""blood and blood"" doth rise,"
3664,PART THE FIRST.,Hast thou an altar for this sacrifice?
3665,PART THE FIRST.,O heaven! O vacant throne!
3666,PART THE FIRST.,O crownèd hierarchies that wear your crown
3667,PART THE FIRST.,When His is put away!
3668,PART THE FIRST.,Are ye unshamèd that ye cannot dim
3669,PART THE FIRST.,"Your alien brightness to be liker him,"
3670,PART THE FIRST.,"Assume a human passion, and down-lay"
3671,PART THE FIRST.,"Your sweet secureness for congenial fears,"
3672,PART THE FIRST.,And teach your cloudless ever-burning eyes
3673,PART THE FIRST.,The mystery of his tears?
3674,PART THE FIRST.,
3675,PART THE FIRST.,"_Zerah._ I am strong, I am strong."
3676,PART THE FIRST.,"Were I never to see my heaven again,"
3677,PART THE FIRST.,I would wheel to earth like the tempest rain
3678,PART THE FIRST.,Which sweeps there with an exultant sound
3679,PART THE FIRST.,To lose its life as it reaches the ground.
3680,PART THE FIRST.,"I am strong, I am strong."
3681,PART THE FIRST.,Away from mine inward vision swim
3682,PART THE FIRST.,"The shining seats of my heavenly birth,"
3683,PART THE FIRST.,"I see but his, I see but him--"
3684,PART THE FIRST.,The Maker's steps on his cruel earth.
3685,PART THE FIRST.,Will the bitter herbs of earth grow sweet
3686,PART THE FIRST.,"To me, as trodden by his feet?"
3687,PART THE FIRST.,"Will the vexed, accurst humanity,"
3688,PART THE FIRST.,"As worn by him, begin to be"
3689,PART THE FIRST.,"A blessed, yea, a sacred thing"
3690,PART THE FIRST.,For love and awe and ministering?
3691,PART THE FIRST.,"I am strong, I am strong."
3692,PART THE FIRST.,By our angel ken shall we survey
3693,PART THE FIRST.,His loving smile through his woeful clay?
3694,PART THE FIRST.,"I am swift, I am strong,"
3695,PART THE FIRST.,The love is bearing me along.
3696,PART THE FIRST.,
3697,PART THE FIRST.,_Ador._ One love is bearing us along.
3698,PART THE FIRST.,

3706,PART THE SECOND.,
3707,PART THE SECOND.,"_Zerah._    Thee,--thee."
3708,PART THE SECOND.,Thy burning eyes already are
3709,PART THE SECOND.,Grown wild and mournful as a star
3710,PART THE SECOND.,Whose occupation is for aye
3711,PART THE SECOND.,To look upon the place of clay
3712,PART THE SECOND.,Whereon thou lookest now.
3713,PART THE SECOND.,The crown is fainting on thy brow
3714,PART THE SECOND.,"To the likeness of a cloud,"
3715,PART THE SECOND.,The forehead's self a little bowed
3716,PART THE SECOND.,"From its aspect high and holy,"
3717,PART THE SECOND.,As it would in meekness meet
3718,PART THE SECOND.,Some seraphic melancholy:
3719,PART THE SECOND.,Thy very wings that lately flung
3720,PART THE SECOND.,"An outline clear, do flicker here"
3721,PART THE SECOND.,"And wear to each a shadow hung,"
3722,PART THE SECOND.,Dropped across thy feet.
3723,PART THE SECOND.,In these strange contrasting glooms
3724,PART THE SECOND.,"Stagnant with the scent of tombs,"
3725,PART THE SECOND.,"Seraph faces, O my brother,"
3726,PART THE SECOND.,Show awfully to one another.
3727,PART THE SECOND.,
3728,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._ Dost thou see?
3729,PART THE SECOND.,
3730,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._               Even so; I see
3731,PART THE SECOND.,"Our empyreal company,"

3764,PART THE SECOND.,With an irrepressive passion

3766,PART THE SECOND.,Rising up and forsaking

3921,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._ Little drops in the lapse!

3964,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._                          For one

3971,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._ And one--
3972,PART THE SECOND.,
3973,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._             Has also sinned.
3974,PART THE SECOND.,And yet (O marvel!) doth the Spirit-wind
3975,PART THE SECOND.,Blow white those waters? Death upon his face

3977,PART THE SECOND.,A tender shine by looks beloved made:
3978,PART THE SECOND.,"He seemeth dying in a quiet place,"
3979,PART THE SECOND.,And less by iron wounds in hands and feet

3982,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._ And ONE!--

3992,PART THE SECOND.,
3993,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._                            But hast trod
3994,PART THE SECOND.,"The depths of love in thy peculiar nature,"

3999,PART THE SECOND.,"Within, Upholder!"
4000,PART THE SECOND.,
4001,PART THE SECOND.,"_Ador._              And below, below,"

4003,PART THE SECOND.,
4004,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._ Why do I pause?--
4005,PART THE SECOND.,
4006,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._                      There is a silentness
4007,PART THE SECOND.,"That answers thee enow,"
4008,PART THE SECOND.,"That, like a brazen sound"
4009,PART THE SECOND.,"Excluding others, doth ensheathe us round,--"
4010,PART THE SECOND.,Hear it. It is not from the visible skies
4011,PART THE SECOND.,"Though they are still,"
4012,PART THE SECOND.,Unconscious that their own dropped dews express
4013,PART THE SECOND.,The light of heaven on every earthly hill.
4014,PART THE SECOND.,"It is not from the hills, though calm and bare"
4015,PART THE SECOND.,"They, since their first creation,"
4016,PART THE SECOND.,Through midnight cloud or morning's glittering air
4017,PART THE SECOND.,"Or the deep deluge blindness, toward the place"
4018,PART THE SECOND.,"Whence thrilled the mystic word's creative grace,"
4019,PART THE SECOND.,And whence again shall come
4020,PART THE SECOND.,"The word that uncreates,"
4021,PART THE SECOND.,Have lift their brows in voiceless expectation.
4022,PART THE SECOND.,It is not from the places that entomb
4023,PART THE SECOND.,"Man's dead, though common Silence there dilates"

4026,PART THE SECOND.,Not there: not there.
4027,PART THE SECOND.,"Not yet within those chambers lieth He,"
4028,PART THE SECOND.,A dead one in his living world; his south
4029,PART THE SECOND.,"And west winds blowing over earth and sea,"
4030,PART THE SECOND.,And not a breath on that creating mouth.
4031,PART THE SECOND.,"But now,--a silence keeps"
4032,PART THE SECOND.,"(Not death's, nor sleep's)"
4033,PART THE SECOND.,The lips whose whispered word
4034,PART THE SECOND.,Might roll the thunders round reverberated.
4035,PART THE SECOND.,"Silent art thou, O my Lord,"
4036,PART THE SECOND.,Bowing down thy stricken head!
4037,PART THE SECOND.,"Fearest thou, a groan of thine"
4038,PART THE SECOND.,Would make the pulse of thy creation fail
4039,PART THE SECOND.,As thine own pulse?--would rend the veil
4040,PART THE SECOND.,Of visible things and let the flood
4041,PART THE SECOND.,"Of the unseen Light, the essential God,"
4042,PART THE SECOND.,Rush in to whelm the undivine?
4043,PART THE SECOND.,"Thy silence, to my thinking, is as dread."

4045,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._ O silence!
4046,PART THE SECOND.,
4047,PART THE SECOND.,"_Ador._            Doth it say to thee--the NAME,"
4048,PART THE SECOND.,Slow-learning seraph?
4049,PART THE SECOND.,
4050,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._              I have learnt.

4052,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._                               The flame

4054,PART THE SECOND.,
4055,PART THE SECOND.,"_Zerah._              He opened his,"

4058,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._                       Their agony?
4059,PART THE SECOND.,
4060,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._ Their love. God's depth is in them. From his brows
4061,PART THE SECOND.,"White, terrible in meekness, didst thou see"
4062,PART THE SECOND.,The lifted eyes unclose?
4063,PART THE SECOND.,"He is God, seraph! Look no more on me,"
4064,PART THE SECOND.,O God--I am not God.
4065,PART THE SECOND.,
4066,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._                 The loving is
4067,PART THE SECOND.,Sublimed within them by the sorrowful.
4068,PART THE SECOND.,In heaven we could sustain them.
4069,PART THE SECOND.,
4070,PART THE SECOND.,"_Zerah._                         Heaven is dull,"
4071,PART THE SECOND.,"Mine Ador, to man's earth. The light that burns"
4072,PART THE SECOND.,"In fluent, refluent motion"
4073,PART THE SECOND.,Along the crystal ocean;
4074,PART THE SECOND.,The springing of the golden harps between
4075,PART THE SECOND.,"The bowery wings, in fountains of sweet sound,"
4076,PART THE SECOND.,"The winding, wandering music that returns"
4077,PART THE SECOND.,"Upon itself, exultingly self-bound"
4078,PART THE SECOND.,In the great spheric round
4079,PART THE SECOND.,Of everlasting praises;
4080,PART THE SECOND.,"The God-thoughts in our midst that intervene,"
4081,PART THE SECOND.,Visibly flashing from the supreme throne
4082,PART THE SECOND.,Full in seraphic faces
4083,PART THE SECOND.,"Till each astonishes the other, grown"

4085,PART THE SECOND.,My heaven! my home of heaven! my infinite

4095,PART THE SECOND.,
4096,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._                  Calm-deep. They show
4097,PART THE SECOND.,A passion which is tranquil. They are seeing
4098,PART THE SECOND.,"No earth, no heaven, no men that slay and curse,"
4099,PART THE SECOND.,No seraphs that adore;
4100,PART THE SECOND.,"Their gaze is on the invisible, the dread,"
4101,PART THE SECOND.,"The things we cannot view or think or speak,"
4102,PART THE SECOND.,"Because we are too happy, or too weak,--"

4106,PART THE SECOND.,"But he, accomplished in Jehovah-being,"

4112,PART THE SECOND.,"_Zerah._ Thus, do I find Thee thus? My undiminished"

4121,PART THE SECOND.,"Unteaching the heaven-echoes? Dare I say,"
4122,PART THE SECOND.,"""Creator, thou art feebler than thy work!"
4123,PART THE SECOND.,"Creator, thou art sadder than thy creature!"
4124,PART THE SECOND.,"A worm, and not a man,"
4125,PART THE SECOND.,"Yea, no worm, but a curse?"""
4126,PART THE SECOND.,I dare not so mine heavenly phrase reverse.
4127,PART THE SECOND.,Albeit the piercing thorn and thistle-fork
4128,PART THE SECOND.,(Whose seed disordered ran
4129,PART THE SECOND.,From Eve's hand trembling when the curse did reach her)
4130,PART THE SECOND.,"Be garnered darklier in thy soul, the rod"

4145,PART THE SECOND.,The sanctities and sanctified above
4146,PART THE SECOND.,"Shall each to each, with lifted looks serene,"
4147,PART THE SECOND.,"Their shining faces lean,"
4148,PART THE SECOND.,And mix the adoring breath
4149,PART THE SECOND.,And breathe the full thanksgiving.
4150,PART THE SECOND.,
4151,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._                           But the love--

4153,PART THE SECOND.,
4154,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._                 Do we love not?
4155,PART THE SECOND.,
4156,PART THE SECOND.,"_Zerah._                                   Yea,"
4157,PART THE SECOND.,"But not as man shall! not with life for death,"
4158,PART THE SECOND.,New-throbbing through the startled being; not
4159,PART THE SECOND.,"With strange astonished smiles, that ever may"
4160,PART THE SECOND.,Gush passionate like tears and fill their place:
4161,PART THE SECOND.,Nor yet with speechless memories of what
4162,PART THE SECOND.,"Earth's winters were, enverduring the green"
4163,PART THE SECOND.,Of every heavenly palm
4164,PART THE SECOND.,"Whose windless, shadeless calm"
4165,PART THE SECOND.,Moves only at the breath of the Unseen.
4166,PART THE SECOND.,"Oh, not with this blood on us--and this face,--"
4167,PART THE SECOND.,"Still, haply, pale with sorrow that it bore"
4168,PART THE SECOND.,"In our behalf, and tender evermore"

4182,PART THE SECOND.,"Who love thee more than we do: blessed we,"
4183,PART THE SECOND.,"Viewing that love which shall exceed even this,"
4184,PART THE SECOND.,And winning in the sight a double bliss
4185,PART THE SECOND.,For all so lost in love's supremacy.
4186,PART THE SECOND.,The bliss is better. Only on the sad

4189,PART THE SECOND.,"The bliss is better. Love him more, O man,"

4196,PART THE SECOND.,_Ador._                             The loving word
4197,PART THE SECOND.,Is caught by those from whom we stand apart.
4198,PART THE SECOND.,For silence hath no deepness in her heart
4199,PART THE SECOND.,Where love's low name low breathed would not be heard
4200,PART THE SECOND.,"By angels, clear as thunder."
4201,PART THE SECOND.,
4202,PART THE SECOND.,_Angelic Voices._            Love him more!

4206,PART THE SECOND.,Albeit to love there were not ever given
4207,PART THE SECOND.,"A mournful sound when uttered out of heaven,"

4209,PART THE SECOND.,Of love be silent now! we gaze adown

4211,PART THE SECOND.,_Zerah._ No crown! the woe instead
4212,PART THE SECOND.,"Is heavy on his head,"
4213,PART THE SECOND.,Pressing inward on his brain
4214,PART THE SECOND.,With a hot and clinging pain
4215,PART THE SECOND.,"Till all tears are prest away,"

4217,PART THE SECOND.,Peruse the black abyss.

4665,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Indissoluble of adamantine chains
4666,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Fasten against this beetling precipice
4667,PROMETHEUS BOUND,This guilty god. Because he filched away
4668,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thine own bright flower, the glory of plastic fire,"
4669,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And gifted mortals with it,--such a sin"
4670,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"It doth behove he expiate to the gods,"
4671,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Learning to accept the empery of Zeus

4695,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Undue respect to mortals, for that crime"
4696,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thou art adjudged to guard this joyless rock,"
4697,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Erect, unslumbering, bending not the knee,"
4698,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And many a cry and unavailing moan
4699,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To utter on the air. For Zeus is stern
4700,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And new-made kings are cruel.
4701,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4702,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Strength._                    Be it so.
4703,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Why loiter in vain pity? Why not hate
4704,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A god the gods hate? one too who betrayed
4705,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy glory unto men?
4706,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4707,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hephæstus._             An awful thing
4708,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Is kinship joined to friendship.
4709,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4710,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Strength._                      Grant it be;
4711,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Is disobedience to the Father's word
4712,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A possible thing? Dost quail not more for that?
4713,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4714,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hephæstus._ Thou, at least, art a stern one: ever bold."
4715,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4716,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Strength._ Why, if I wept, it were no remedy;"
4717,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And do not _thou_ spend labour on the air
4718,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To bootless uses.
4719,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4720,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hephæstus._       Cursed handicraft!
4721,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I curse and hate thee, O my craft!"
4722,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4723,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Strength._                           Why hate
4724,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy craft most plainly innocent of all
4725,PROMETHEUS BOUND,These pending ills?
4726,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4727,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hephæstus._         I would some other hand
4728,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Were here to work it!
4729,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4730,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Strength._           All work hath its pain,"
4731,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Except to rule the gods. There is none free
4732,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Except King Zeus.
4733,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4734,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hephæstus._         I know it very well:
4735,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I argue not against it.
4736,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4737,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Strength._             Why not, then,"
4738,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Make haste and lock the fetters over HIM
4739,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Lest Zeus behold thee lagging?
4740,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4741,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hephæstus._                    Here be chains.
4742,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Zeus may behold these.
4743,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4744,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Strength._              Seize him: strike amain:
4745,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Strike with the hammer on each side his hands--
4746,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Rivet him to the rock.
4747,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4748,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hephæstus._          The work is done,"
4749,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And thoroughly done.
4750,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4751,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Strength._           Still faster grapple him;
4752,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Wedge him in deeper: leave no inch to stir.
4753,PROMETHEUS BOUND,He's terrible for finding a way out
4754,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From the irremediable.
4755,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4756,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hephæstus._           Here's an arm, at least,"
4757,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Grappled past freeing.
4758,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4759,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Strength._           Now then, buckle me"
4760,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The other securely. Let this wise one learn
4761,PROMETHEUS BOUND,He's duller than our Zeus.
4762,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4763,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hephæstus._               Oh, none but he"
4764,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Accuse me justly.
4765,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4766,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Strength._       Now, straight through the chest,"
4767,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Take him and bite him with the clenching tooth
4768,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of the adamantine wedge, and rivet him."
4769,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4770,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hephæstus._ Alas, Prometheus, what thou sufferest here"
4771,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I sorrow over.
4772,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4773,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Strength._    Dost thou flinch again
4774,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And breathe groans for the enemies of Zeus?
4775,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Beware lest thine own pity find thee out.
4776,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4777,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hephæstus._ Thou dost behold a spectacle that turns
4778,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The sight o' the eyes to pity.
4779,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4780,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Strength._                      I behold
4781,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A sinner suffer his sin's penalty.
4782,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But lash the thongs about his sides.
4783,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4784,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hephæstus._                        So much,"
4785,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I must do. Urge no farther than I must.
4786,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4787,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Strength._ Ay, but I _will_ urge!--and, with shout on shout,"
4788,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Will hound thee at this quarry. Get thee down
4789,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And ring amain the iron round his legs.
4790,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4791,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hephæstus._ That work was not long doing.
4792,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4793,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Strength._                                 Heavily now
4794,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Let fall the strokes upon the perforant gyves:
4795,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For He who rates the work has a heavy hand.
4796,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4797,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hephæstus._ Thy speech is savage as thy shape.
4798,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4799,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Strength._                                   Be thou
4800,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Gentle and tender! but revile not me
4801,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For the firm will and the untruckling hate.
4802,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4803,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hephæstus._ Let us go. He is netted round with chains.
4804,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4805,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Strength._ Here, now, taunt on! and having spoiled the gods"
4806,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of honours, crown withal thy mortal men"
4807,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Who live a whole day out. Why how could _they_
4808,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Draw off from thee one single of thy griefs?
4809,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Methinks the Dæmons gave thee a wrong name,"
4810,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"""Prometheus,"" which means Providence,--because"
4811,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thou dost thyself need providence to see
4812,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy roll and ruin from the top of doom.
4813,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4814,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus (alone)._ O holy Æther, and swift-wingèd Winds,"
4815,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And River-wells, and laughter innumerous"
4816,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of yon sea-waves! Earth, mother of us all,"
4817,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And all-viewing cyclic Sun, I cry on you,--"
4818,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Behold me, a god, what I endure from gods!"
4819,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Behold, with throe on throe,"
4820,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"How, wasted by this woe,"
4821,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I wrestle down the myriad years of time!
4822,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Behold, how fast around me,"
4823,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The new King of the happy ones sublime
4824,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Has flung the chain he forged, has shamed and bound me!"
4825,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Woe, woe! to-day's woe and the coming morrow's"
4826,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I cover with one groan. And where is found me
4827,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A limit to these sorrows?
4828,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And yet what word do I say? I have foreknown
4829,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Clearly all things that should be; nothing done
4830,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Comes sudden to my soul; and I must bear
4831,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"What is ordained with patience, being aware"
4832,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Necessity doth front the universe
4833,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With an invincible gesture. Yet this curse
4834,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Which strikes me now, I find it hard to brave"
4835,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In silence or in speech. Because I gave
4836,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Honour to mortals, I have yoked my soul"
4837,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To this compelling fate. Because I stole
4838,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The secret fount of fire, whose bubbles went"
4839,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Over the ferule's brim, and manward sent"
4840,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Art's mighty means and perfect rudiment,"
4841,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That sin I expiate in this agony,"
4842,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Hung here in fetters, 'neath the blanching sky."
4843,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Ah, ah me! what a sound,"
4844,PROMETHEUS BOUND,What a fragrance sweeps up from a pinion unseen
4845,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of a god, or a mortal, or nature between,"
4846,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Sweeping up to this rock where the earth has her bound,"
4847,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To have sight of my pangs or some guerdon obtain.
4848,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Lo, a god in the anguish, a god in the chain!"
4849,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The god, Zeus hateth sore"
4850,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And his gods hate again,"
4851,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"As many as tread on his glorified floor,"
4852,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Because I loved mortals too much evermore.
4853,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Alas me! what a murmur and motion I hear,"
4854,PROMETHEUS BOUND,As of birds flying near!
4855,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And the air undersings
4856,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The light stroke of their wings--
4857,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And all life that approaches I wait for in fear.
4858,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4859,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus of Sea Nymphs, 1st Strophe._"
4860,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Fear nothing! our troop
4861,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Floats lovingly up
4862,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With a quick-oaring stroke
4863,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of wings steered to the rock,"
4864,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Having softened the soul of our father below.
4865,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For the gales of swift-bearing have sent me a sound,"
4866,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And the clank of the iron, the malleted blow,"
4867,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Smote down the profound
4868,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of my caverns of old,"
4869,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And struck the red light in a blush from my brow,--"
4870,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Till I sprang up unsandaled, in haste to behold,"
4871,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And rushed forth on my chariot of wings manifold.
4872,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4873,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ Alas me!--alas me!
4874,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Ye offspring of Tethys who bore at her breast
4875,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Many children, and eke of Oceanus, he"
4876,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Coiling still around earth with perpetual unrest!
4877,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Behold me and see
4878,PROMETHEUS BOUND,How transfixed with the fang
4879,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of a fetter I hang
4880,PROMETHEUS BOUND,On the high-jutting rocks of this fissure and keep
4881,PROMETHEUS BOUND,An uncoveted watch o'er the world and the deep.
4882,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4883,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus, 1st Antistrophe._"
4884,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I behold thee, Prometheus; yet now, yet now,"
4885,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A terrible cloud whose rain is tears
4886,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Sweeps over mine eyes that witness how
4887,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy body appears
4888,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Hung awaste on the rocks by infrangible chains:
4889,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For new is the Hand, new the rudder that steers"
4890,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The ship of Olympus through surge and wind--
4891,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And of old things passed, no track is behind."
4892,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4893,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Under earth, under Hades"
4894,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Where the home of the shade is,"
4895,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"All into the deep, deep Tartarus,"
4896,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I would he had hurled me adown.
4897,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I would he had plunged me, fastened thus"
4898,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In the knotted chain with the savage clang,"
4899,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"All into the dark where there should be none,"
4900,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Neither god nor another, to laugh and see."
4901,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But now the winds sing through and shake
4902,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The hurtling chains wherein I hang,"
4903,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And I, in my naked sorrows, make"
4904,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Much mirth for my enemy.
4905,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4906,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus, 2nd Strophe._"
4907,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Nay! who of the gods hath a heart so stern
4908,PROMETHEUS BOUND,As to use thy woe for a mock and mirth?
4909,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Who would not turn more mild to learn
4910,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy sorrows? who of the heaven and earth
4911,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Save Zeus? But he
4912,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Right wrathfully
4913,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Bears on his sceptral soul unbent
4914,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And rules thereby the heavenly seed,"
4915,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Nor will he pause till he content
4916,PROMETHEUS BOUND,His thirsty heart in a finished deed;
4917,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Or till Another shall appear,"
4918,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To win by fraud, to seize by fear"
4919,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The hard-to-be-captured government.
4920,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4921,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Yet even of _me_ he shall have need,"
4922,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That monarch of the blessed seed,"
4923,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of me, of me, who now am cursed"
4924,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"By his fetters dire,--"
4925,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To wring my secret out withal
4926,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And learn by whom his sceptre shall
4927,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Be filched from him--as was, at first,"
4928,PROMETHEUS BOUND,His heavenly fire.
4929,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But he never shall enchant me
4930,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With his honey-lipped persuasion;
4931,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Never, never shall he daunt me"
4932,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With the oath and threat of passion
4933,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Into speaking as they want me,"
4934,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Till he loose this savage chain,"
4935,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And accept the expiation
4936,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of my sorrow, in his pain."
4937,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4938,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus, 2nd Antistrophe._"
4939,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thou art, sooth, a brave god,"
4940,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And, for all thou hast borne"
4941,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"From the stroke of the rod,"
4942,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Nought relaxest from scorn.
4943,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But thou speakest unto me
4944,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Too free and unworn;
4945,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And a terror strikes through me
4946,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And festers my soul
4947,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And I fear, in the roll"
4948,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of the storm, for thy fate"
4949,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In the ship far from shore:
4950,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Since the son of Saturnus is hard in his hate
4951,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And unmoved in his heart evermore.
4952,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4953,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ I know that Zeus is stern;
4954,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I know he metes his justice by his will;
4955,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And yet, his soul shall learn"
4956,PROMETHEUS BOUND,More softness when once broken by this ill:
4957,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And curbing his unconquerable vaunt
4958,PROMETHEUS BOUND,He shall rush on in fear to meet with me
4959,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Who rush to meet with him in agony,"
4960,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To issues of harmonious covenant.
4961,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4962,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ Remove the veil from all things and relate
4963,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The story to us,--of what crime accused,"
4964,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Zeus smites thee with dishonourable pangs.
4965,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Speak: if to teach us do not grieve thyself.
4966,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
4967,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ The utterance of these things is torture to me,"
4968,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But so, too, is their silence; each way lies"
4969,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Woe strong as fate.
4970,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"When gods began with wrath,"
4971,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And war rose up between their starry brows,"
4972,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Some choosing to cast Chronos from his throne
4973,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That Zeus might king it there, and some in haste"
4974,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With opposite oaths that they would have no Zeus
4975,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To rule the gods for ever,--I, who brought"
4976,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The counsel I thought meetest, could not move"
4977,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The Titans, children of the Heaven and Earth,"
4978,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"What time, disdaining in their rugged souls"
4979,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"My subtle machinations, they assumed"
4980,PROMETHEUS BOUND,It was an easy thing for force to take
4981,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The mastery of fate. My mother, then,"
4982,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Who is called not only Themis but Earth too,"
4983,PROMETHEUS BOUND,(Her single beauty joys in many names)
4984,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Did teach me with reiterant prophecy
4985,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"What future should be, and how conquering gods"
4986,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Should not prevail by strength and violence
4987,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But by guile only. When I told them so,"
4988,PROMETHEUS BOUND,They would not deign to contemplate the truth
4989,PROMETHEUS BOUND,On all sides round; whereat I deemed it best
4990,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To lead my willing mother upwardly
4991,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And set my Themis face to face with Zeus
4992,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"As willing to receive her. Tartarus,"
4993,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"With its abysmal cloister of the Dark,"
4994,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Because I gave that counsel, covers up"
4995,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The antique Chronos and his siding hosts,"
4996,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And, by that counsel helped, the king of gods"
4997,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Hath recompensed me with these bitter pangs:
4998,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For kingship wears a cancer at the heart,--"
4999,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Distrust in friendship. Do ye also ask
5000,PROMETHEUS BOUND,What crime it is for which he tortures me?
5001,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That shall be clear before you. When at first
5002,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"He filled his father's throne, he instantly"
5003,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Made various gifts of glory to the gods
5004,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And dealt the empire out. Alone of men,"
5005,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of miserable men, he took no count,"
5006,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But yearned to sweep their track off from the world
5007,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And plant a newer race there. Not a god
5008,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Resisted such desire except myself.
5009,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_I_ dared it! _I_ drew mortals back to light,"
5010,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From meditated ruin deep as hell!
5011,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For which wrong, I am bent down in these pangs"
5012,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Dreadful to suffer, mournful to behold,"
5013,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And I, who pitied man, am thought myself"
5014,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Unworthy of pity; while I render out
5015,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Deep rhythms of anguish 'neath the harping hand
5016,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That strikes me thus--a sight to shame your Zeus!
5017,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5018,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ Hard as thy chains and cold as all these rocks
5019,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Is he, Prometheus, who withholds his heart"
5020,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5021,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From joining in thy woe. I yearned before
5022,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To fly this sight; and, now I gaze on it,"
5023,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I sicken inwards.
5024,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5025,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._       To my friends, indeed,"
5026,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I must be a sad sight.
5027,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5028,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._               And didst thou sin
5029,PROMETHEUS BOUND,No more than so?
5030,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5031,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._     I did restrain besides
5032,PROMETHEUS BOUND,My mortals from premeditating death.
5033,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5034,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ How didst thou medicine the plague-fear of death?
5035,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5036,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ I set blind Hopes to inhabit in their house.
5037,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5038,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ By that gift thou didst help thy mortals well.
5039,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5040,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ I gave them also fire.
5041,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5042,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus._                            And have they now,"
5043,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Those creatures of a day, the red-eyed fire?"
5044,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5045,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ They have: and shall learn by it many arts.
5046,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5047,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ And truly for such sins Zeus tortures thee
5048,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And will remit no anguish? Is there set
5049,PROMETHEUS BOUND,No limit before thee to thine agony?
5050,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5051,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ No other: only what seems good to HIM.
5052,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5053,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ And how will it seem good? what hope remains?
5054,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Seest thou not that thou hast sinned? But that thou hast sinned
5055,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"It glads me not to speak of, and grieves thee:"
5056,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Then let it pass from both, and seek thyself"
5057,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Some outlet from distress.
5058,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5059,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._               It is in truth
5060,PROMETHEUS BOUND,An easy thing to stand aloof from pain
5061,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And lavish exhortation and advice
5062,PROMETHEUS BOUND,On one vexed sorely by it. I have known
5063,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"All in prevision. By my choice, my choice,"
5064,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I freely sinned--I will confess my sin--
5065,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And helping mortals, found my own despair."
5066,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I did not think indeed that I should pine
5067,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Beneath such pangs against such skyey rocks,"
5068,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Doomed to this drear hill and no neighbouring
5069,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of any life: but mourn not ye for griefs
5070,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I bear to-day: hear rather, dropping down"
5071,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To the plain, how other woes creep on to me,"
5072,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And learn the consummation of my doom.
5073,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Beseech you, nymphs, beseech you, grieve for me"
5074,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Who now am grieving; for Grief walks the earth,"
5075,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And sits down at the foot of each by turns.
5076,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5077,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus._ We hear the deep clash of thy words,"
5078,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Prometheus, and obey."
5079,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And I spring with a rapid foot away
5080,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"From the rushing car and the holy air,"
5081,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The track of birds;
5082,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And I drop to the rugged ground and there
5083,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Await the tale of thy despair.
5084,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5085,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_OCEANUS enters._
5086,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5087,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Oceanus._ I reach the bourn of my weary road
5088,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Where I may see and answer thee,"
5089,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Prometheus, in thine agony."
5090,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"On the back of the quick-winged bird I glode,"
5091,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And I bridled him in
5092,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With the will of a god.
5093,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Behold, thy sorrow aches in me"
5094,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Constrained by the force of kin.
5095,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Nay, though that tie were all undone,"
5096,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For the life of none beneath the sun
5097,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Would I seek a larger benison
5098,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Than I seek for thine.
5099,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And thou shalt learn my words are truth,--"
5100,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That no fair parlance of the mouth
5101,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Grows falsely out of mine.
5102,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Now give me a deed to prove my faith;
5103,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For no faster friend is named in breath
5104,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Than I, Oceanus, am thine."
5105,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5106,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ Ha! what has brought thee? Hast thou also come
5107,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To look upon my woe? How hast thou dared
5108,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To leave the depths called after thee, the caves"
5109,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Self-hewn and self-roofed with spontaneous rock,"
5110,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To visit earth, the mother of my chain?"
5111,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Hast come indeed to view my doom and mourn
5112,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That I should sorrow thus? Gaze on, and see"
5113,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"How I, the fast friend of your Zeus,--how I"
5114,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The erector of the empire in his hand,"
5115,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Am bent beneath that hand, in this despair."
5116,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5117,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Oceanus._ Prometheus, I behold: and I would fain"
5118,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Exhort thee, though already subtle enough,"
5119,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To a better wisdom. Titan, know thyself,"
5120,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And take new softness to thy manners since
5121,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"A new king rules the gods. If words like these,"
5122,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Harsh words and trenchant, thou wilt fling abroad,"
5123,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Zeus haply, though he sit so far and high,"
5124,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"May hear thee do it, and so, this wrath of his"
5125,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Which now affects thee fiercely, shall appear"
5126,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"A mere child's sport at vengeance. Wretched god,"
5127,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Rather dismiss the passion which thou hast,"
5128,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And seek a change from grief. Perhaps I seem
5129,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To address thee with old saws and outworn sense,--"
5130,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Yet such a curse, Prometheus, surely waits"
5131,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"On lips that speak too proudly: thou, meantime,"
5132,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Art none the meeker, nor dost yield a jot"
5133,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To evil circumstance, preparing still"
5134,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To swell the account of grief with other griefs
5135,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Than what are borne. Beseech thee, use me then"
5136,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For counsel: do not spurn against the pricks,--"
5137,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Seeing that who reigns, reigns by cruelty"
5138,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Instead of right. And now, I go from hence,"
5139,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And will endeavour if a power of mine
5140,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Can break thy fetters through. For thee,--be calm,"
5141,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And smooth thy words from passion. Knowest thou not
5142,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of perfect knowledge, thou who knowest too much,"
5143,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That where the tongue wags, ruin never lags?"
5144,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5145,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ I gratulate thee who hast shared and dared
5146,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"All things with me, except their penalty."
5147,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Enough so! leave these thoughts. It cannot be
5148,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That thou shouldst move HIM. HE may _not_ be moved;
5149,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And _thou_ beware of sorrow on this road.
5150,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5151,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Oceanus._ Ay! ever wiser for another's use
5152,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Than thine! the event, and not the prophecy,"
5153,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Attests it to me. Yet where now I rush,"
5154,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy wisdom hath no power to drag me back;
5155,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Because I glory, glory, to go hence"
5156,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And win for thee deliverance from thy pangs,"
5157,PROMETHEUS BOUND,As a free gift from Zeus.
5158,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5159,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._             Why there, again,"
5160,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I give thee gratulation and applause.
5161,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thou lackest no goodwill. But, as for deeds,"
5162,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Do nought! 'twere all done vainly; helping nought,"
5163,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Whatever thou wouldst do. Rather take rest
5164,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And keep thyself from evil. If I grieve,"
5165,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I do not therefore wish to multiply
5166,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The griefs of others. Verily, not so!"
5167,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For still my brother's doom doth vex my soul,--"
5168,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"My brother Atlas, standing in the west,"
5169,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Shouldering the column of the heaven and earth,"
5170,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"A difficult burden! I have also seen,"
5171,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And pitied as I saw, the earth-born one,"
5172,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The inhabitant of old Cilician caves,"
5173,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The great war-monster of the hundred heads,"
5174,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"(All taken and bowed beneath the violent Hand,)"
5175,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Typhon the fierce, who did resist the gods,"
5176,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And, hissing slaughter from his dreadful jaws,"
5177,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Flash out ferocious glory from his eyes
5178,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"As if to storm the throne of Zeus. Whereat,"
5179,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The sleepless arrow of Zeus flew straight at him,"
5180,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The headlong bolt of thunder breathing flame,"
5181,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And struck him downward from his eminence
5182,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of exultation; through the very soul,"
5183,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"It struck him, and his strength was withered up"
5184,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To ashes, thunder-blasted. Now he lies"
5185,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"A helpless trunk supinely, at full length"
5186,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Beside the strait of ocean, spurred into"
5187,PROMETHEUS BOUND,By roots of Ætna; high upon whose tops
5188,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Hephæstus sits and strikes the flashing ore.
5189,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From thence the rivers of fire shall burst away
5190,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Hereafter, and devour with savage jaws"
5191,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The equal plains of fruitful Sicily,"
5192,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Such passion he shall boil back in hot darts
5193,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of an insatiate fury and sough of flame,"
5194,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Fallen Typhon,--howsoever struck and charred"
5195,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"By Zeus's bolted thunder. But for thee,"
5196,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thou art not so unlearned as to need
5197,PROMETHEUS BOUND,My teaching--let thy knowledge save thyself.
5198,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_I_ quaff the full cup of a present doom,"
5199,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And wait till Zeus hath quenched his will in wrath.
5200,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5201,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Oceanus._ Prometheus, art thou ignorant of this,"
5202,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That words do medicine anger?
5203,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5204,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                    If the word
5205,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With seasonable softness touch the soul
5206,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And, where the parts are ulcerous, sear them not"
5207,PROMETHEUS BOUND,By any rudeness.
5208,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5209,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Oceanus._        With a noble aim
5210,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To dare as nobly--is there harm in _that_?
5211,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Dost thou discern it? Teach me.
5212,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5213,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                      I discern
5214,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Vain aspiration, unresultive work."
5215,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5216,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Oceanus._ Then suffer me to bear the brunt of this!
5217,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Since it is profitable that one who is wise
5218,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Should seem not wise at all.
5219,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5220,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                   And such would seem
5221,PROMETHEUS BOUND,My very crime.
5222,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5223,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Oceanus._      In truth thine argument
5224,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Sends me back home.
5225,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5226,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._           Lest any lament for me
5227,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Should cast thee down to hate.
5228,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5229,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Oceanus._                     The hate of him
5230,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Who sits a new king on the absolute throne?
5231,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5232,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Beware of him, lest thine heart grieve by him."
5233,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5234,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Oceanus._ Thy doom, Prometheus, be my teacher!"
5235,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5236,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                                   Go.
5237,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Depart--beware--and keep the mind thou hast.
5238,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5239,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Oceanus._ Thy words drive after, as I rush before."
5240,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Lo! my four-footed bird sweeps smooth and wide
5241,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The flats of air with balanced pinions, glad"
5242,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To bend his knee at home in the ocean-stall.
5243,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5244,PROMETHEUS BOUND,[_OCEANUS departs._
5245,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5246,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus, 1st Strophe._"
5247,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I moan thy fate, I moan for thee,"
5248,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Prometheus! From my eyes too tender,"
5249,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Drop after drop incessantly
5250,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The tears of my heart's pity render
5251,PROMETHEUS BOUND,My cheeks wet from their fountains free;
5252,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Because that Zeus, the stern and cold,"
5253,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Whose law is taken from his breast,"
5254,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Uplifts his sceptre manifest
5255,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Over the gods of old.
5256,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5257,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_1st Antistrophe._
5258,PROMETHEUS BOUND,All the land is moaning
5259,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With a murmured plaint to-day;
5260,PROMETHEUS BOUND,All the mortal nations
5261,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Having habitations
5262,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In the holy Asia
5263,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Are a dirge entoning
5264,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For thine honour and thy brothers',"
5265,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Once majestic beyond others
5266,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In the old belief,--"
5267,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Now are groaning in the groaning
5268,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of thy deep-voiced grief.
5269,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5270,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_2nd Strophe._
5271,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Mourn the maids inhabitant
5272,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of the Colchian land,"
5273,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Who with white, calm bosoms stand"
5274,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In the battle's roar:
5275,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Mourn the Scythian tribes that haunt
5276,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The verge of earth, Mæotis' shore."
5277,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5278,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_2nd Antistrophe._
5279,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Yea! Arabia's battle-crown,"
5280,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And dwellers in the beetling town
5281,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Mount Caucasus sublimely nears,--"
5282,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"An iron squadron, thundering down"
5283,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With the sharp-prowed spears.
5284,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5285,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But one other before, have I seen to remain"
5286,PROMETHEUS BOUND,By invincible pain
5287,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Bound and vanquished,--one Titan! 'twas Atlas, who bears"
5288,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In a curse from the gods, by that strength of his own"
5289,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Which he evermore wears,"
5290,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The weight of the heaven on his shoulder alone,"
5291,PROMETHEUS BOUND,While he sighs up the stars;
5292,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And the tides of the ocean wail bursting their bars,--"
5293,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Murmurs still the profound,"
5294,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And black Hades roars up through the chasm of the ground,"
5295,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And the fountains of pure-running rivers moan low
5296,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In a pathos of woe.
5297,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5298,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Beseech you, think not I am silent thus"
5299,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Through pride or scorn. I only gnaw my heart
5300,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"With meditation, seeing myself so wronged."
5301,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For see--their honours to these new-made gods,"
5302,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"What other gave but I, and dealt them out"
5303,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With distribution? Ay--but here I am dumb!
5304,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For here, I should repeat your knowledge to you,"
5305,PROMETHEUS BOUND,If I spake aught. List rather to the deeds
5306,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I did for mortals; how, being fools before,"
5307,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I made them wise and true in aim of soul.
5308,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And let me tell you--not as taunting men,"
5309,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But teaching you the intention of my gifts,"
5310,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"How, first beholding, they beheld in vain,"
5311,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And hearing, heard not, but, like shapes in dreams,"
5312,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Mixed all things wildly down the tedious time,"
5313,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Nor knew to build a house against the sun
5314,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"With wickered sides, nor any woodcraft knew,"
5315,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But lived, like silly ants, beneath the ground"
5316,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In hollow caves unsunned. There, came to them"
5317,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"No steadfast sign of winter, nor of spring"
5318,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Flower-perfumed, nor of summer full of fruit,"
5319,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But blindly and lawlessly they did all things,"
5320,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Until I taught them how the stars do rise
5321,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And set in mystery, and devised for them"
5322,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Number, the inducer of philosophies,"
5323,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The synthesis of Letters, and, beside,"
5324,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The artificer of all things, Memory,"
5325,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That sweet Muse-mother. I was first to yoke
5326,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The servile beasts in couples, carrying"
5327,PROMETHEUS BOUND,An heirdom of man's burdens on their backs.
5328,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I joined to chariots, steeds, that love the bit"
5329,PROMETHEUS BOUND,They champ at--the chief pomp of golden ease.
5330,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And none but I originated ships,"
5331,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The seaman's chariots, wandering on the brine"
5332,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"With linen wings. And I--oh, miserable!--"
5333,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Who did devise for mortals all these arts,"
5334,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Have no device left now to save myself
5335,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From the woe I suffer.
5336,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5337,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._               Most unseemly woe
5338,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thou sufferest, and dost stagger from the sense"
5339,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Bewildered! like a bad leech falling sick
5340,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thou art faint at soul, and canst not find the drugs"
5341,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Required to save thyself.
5342,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5343,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._            Hearken the rest,"
5344,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And marvel further, what more arts and means"
5345,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I did invent,--this, greatest: if a man"
5346,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Fell sick, there was no cure, nor esculent"
5347,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Nor chrism nor liquid, but for lack of drugs"
5348,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Men pined and wasted, till I showed them all"
5349,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Those mixtures of emollient remedies
5350,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Whereby they might be rescued from disease.
5351,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I fixed the various rules of mantic art,"
5352,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Discerned the vision from the common dream,"
5353,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Instructed them in vocal auguries
5354,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Hard to interpret, and defined as plain"
5355,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The wayside omens,--flights of crook-clawed birds,--"
5356,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Showed which are, by their nature, fortunate,"
5357,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And which not so, and what the food of each,"
5358,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And what the hates, affections, social needs,"
5359,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of all to one another,--taught what sign"
5360,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of visceral lightness, coloured to a shade,"
5361,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"May charm the genial gods, and what fair spots"
5362,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Commend the lung and liver. Burning so
5363,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The limbs encased in fat, and the long chine,"
5364,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I led my mortals on to an art abstruse,"
5365,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And cleared their eyes to the image in the fire,"
5366,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Erst filmed in dark. Enough said now of this
5367,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For the other helps of man hid underground,"
5368,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The iron and the brass, silver and gold,"
5369,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Can any dare affirm he found them out
5370,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Before me? none, I know! unless he choose"
5371,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To lie in his vaunt. In one word learn the whole,--"
5372,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That all arts came to mortals from Prometheus.
5373,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5374,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus._ Give mortals now no inexpedient help,"
5375,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Neglecting thine own sorrow. I have hope still
5376,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To see thee, breaking from the fetter here,"
5377,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Stand up as strong as Zeus.
5378,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5379,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._               This ends not thus,"
5380,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The oracular fate ordains. I must be bowed
5381,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"By infinite woes and pangs, to escape this chain"
5382,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Necessity is stronger than mine art.
5383,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5384,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ Who holds the helm of that Necessity?
5385,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5386,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ The threefold Fates and the unforgetting Furies.
5387,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5388,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ Is Zeus less absolute than these are?
5389,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5390,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._                                    Yea,"
5391,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And therefore cannot fly what is ordained.
5392,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5393,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus._ What is ordained for Zeus, except to be"
5394,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A king for ever?
5395,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5396,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._     'Tis too early yet
5397,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For thee to learn it: ask no more.
5398,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5399,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._                         Perhaps
5400,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy secret may be something holy?
5401,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5402,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                         Turn
5403,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To another matter: this, it is not time"
5404,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To speak abroad, but utterly to veil"
5405,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In silence. For by that same secret kept,"
5406,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I 'scape this chain's dishonour and its woe.
5407,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5408,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus, 1st Strophe._"
5409,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Never, oh never"
5410,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"May Zeus, the all-giver,"
5411,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Wrestle down from his throne
5412,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In that might of his own
5413,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To antagonize mine!
5414,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Nor let me delay
5415,PROMETHEUS BOUND,As I bend on my way
5416,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Toward the gods of the shrine
5417,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Where the altar is full
5418,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of the blood of the bull,"
5419,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Near the tossing brine
5420,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of Ocean my father.
5421,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"May no sin be sped in the word that is said,"
5422,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But my vow be rather
5423,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Consummated,"
5424,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Nor evermore fail, nor evermore pine."
5425,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5426,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_1st Antistrophe._
5427,PROMETHEUS BOUND,'Tis sweet to have
5428,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Life lengthened out
5429,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With hopes proved brave
5430,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"By the very doubt,"
5431,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Till the spirit enfold
5432,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Those manifest joys which were foretold.
5433,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But I thrill to behold
5434,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thee, victim doomed,"
5435,PROMETHEUS BOUND,By the countless cares
5436,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And the drear despairs
5437,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Forever consumed,--"
5438,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And all because thou, who art fearless now"
5439,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of Zeus above,"
5440,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Didst overflow for mankind below
5441,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"With a free-souled, reverent love."
5442,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Ah friend, behold and see!"
5443,PROMETHEUS BOUND,What's all the beauty of humanity?
5444,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Can it be fair?
5445,PROMETHEUS BOUND,What's all the strength? is it strong?
5446,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And what hope can they bear,"
5447,PROMETHEUS BOUND,These dying livers--living one day long?
5448,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Ah, seest thou not, my friend,"
5449,PROMETHEUS BOUND,How feeble and slow
5450,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And like a dream, doth go"
5451,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"This poor blind manhood, drifted from its end?"
5452,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And how no mortal wranglings can confuse
5453,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The harmony of Zeus?
5454,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5455,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Prometheus, I have learnt these things"
5456,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From the sorrow in thy face.
5457,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Another song did fold its wings
5458,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Upon my lips in other days,"
5459,PROMETHEUS BOUND,When round the bath and round the bed
5460,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The hymeneal chant instead
5461,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I sang for thee, and smiled,--"
5462,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And thou didst lead, with gifts and vows,"
5463,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Hesione, my father's child,"
5464,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To be thy wedded spouse.
5465,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5466,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_IO enters_.
5467,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5468,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._ What land is this? what people is here?
5469,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And who is he that writhes, I see,"
5470,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In the rock-hung chain?
5471,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Now what is the crime that hath brought thee to pain?
5472,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Now what is the land--make answer free--
5473,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Which I wander through, in my wrong and fear?"
5474,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Ah! ah! ah me!
5475,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The gad-fly strength to agony!
5476,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"O Earth, keep off that phantasm pale"
5477,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of earth-born Argus!--ah!--I quail
5478,PROMETHEUS BOUND,When my soul descries
5479,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That herdsman with the myriad eyes
5480,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Which seem, as he comes, one crafty eye"
5481,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Graves hide him not, though he should die,"
5482,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But he doggeth me in my misery
5483,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"From the roots of death, on high--on high--"
5484,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And along the sands of the siding deep,"
5485,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"All famine-worn, he follows me,"
5486,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And his waxen reed doth undersound
5487,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The waters round
5488,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And giveth a measure that giveth sleep.
5489,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5490,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Woe, woe, woe!"
5491,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Where shall my weary course be done?
5492,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"What wouldst thou with me, Saturn's son?"
5493,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And in what have I sinned, that I should go"
5494,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thus yoked to grief by thine hand for ever?
5495,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Ah! ah! dost vex me so
5496,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That I madden and shiver
5497,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Stung through with dread?
5498,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Flash the fire down to burn me!
5499,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Heave the earth up to cover me!
5500,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Plunge me in the deep, with the salt waves over me,"
5501,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That the sea-beasts may be fed!
5502,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"O king, do not spurn me"
5503,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In my prayer!
5504,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For this wandering everlonger, evermore,"
5505,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Hath overworn me,"
5506,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And I know not on what shore
5507,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I may rest from my despair.
5508,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5509,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ Hearest thou what the ox-horned maiden saith?
5510,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5511,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ How could I choose but hearken what she saith,"
5512,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The phrensied maiden?--Inachus's child?--
5513,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Who love-warms Zeus's heart, and now is lashed"
5514,PROMETHEUS BOUND,By Herè's hate along the unending ways?
5515,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5516,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._ Who taught thee to articulate that name,--"
5517,PROMETHEUS BOUND,My father's? Speak to his child
5518,PROMETHEUS BOUND,By grief and shame defiled!
5519,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Who art thou, victim, thou who dost acclaim"
5520,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Mine anguish in true words on the wide air,"
5521,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And callest too by name the curse that came
5522,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"From Herè unaware,"
5523,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To waste and pierce me with its maddening goad?
5524,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Ah--ah--I leap
5525,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With the pang of the hungry--I bound on the road--
5526,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I am driven by my doom--
5527,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I am overcome
5528,PROMETHEUS BOUND,By the wrath of an enemy strong and deep!
5529,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Are any of those who have tasted pain,"
5530,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Alas! as wretched as I?
5531,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Now tell me plain, doth aught remain"
5532,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For my soul to endure beneath the sky?
5533,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Is there any help to be holpen by?
5534,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"If knowledge be in thee, let it be said!"
5535,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Cry aloud--cry
5536,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To the wandering, woful maid!"
5537,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5538,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Whatever thou wouldst learn I will declare,--"
5539,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"No riddle upon my lips, but such straight words"
5540,PROMETHEUS BOUND,As friends should use to each other when they talk.
5541,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thou seest Prometheus, who gave mortals fire."
5542,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5543,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._ O common Help of all men, known of all,"
5544,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"O miserable Prometheus,--for what cause"
5545,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Dost thou endure thus?
5546,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5547,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._            I have done with wail
5548,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For my own griefs, but lately."
5549,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5550,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                          Wilt thou not
5551,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Vouchsafe the boon to me?
5552,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5553,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._                Say what thou wilt,"
5554,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For I vouchsafe all.
5555,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5556,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._                Speak then, and reveal"
5557,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Who shut thee in this chasm.
5558,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5559,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._                 The will of Zeus,"
5560,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The hand of his Hephæstus.
5561,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5562,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                          And what crime
5563,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Dost expiate so?
5564,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5565,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._    Enough for thee I have told
5566,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In so much only.
5567,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5568,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._            Nay, but show besides"
5569,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The limit of my wandering, and the time"
5570,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Which yet is lacking to fulfil my grief.
5571,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5572,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Why, not to know were better than to know"
5573,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For such as thou.
5574,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5575,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._             Beseech thee, blind me not"
5576,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To that which I must suffer.
5577,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5578,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._                If I do,"
5579,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The reason is not that I grudge a boon.
5580,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5581,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._ What reason, then, prevents thy speaking out?"
5582,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5583,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ No grudging; but a fear to break thine heart.
5584,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5585,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._ Less care for me, I pray thee. Certainty"
5586,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I count for advantage.
5587,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5588,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._         Thou wilt have it so,"
5589,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And therefore I must speak. Now hear--
5590,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5591,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._                                Not yet.
5592,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Give half the guerdon my way. Let us learn
5593,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"First, what the curse is that befell the maid,--"
5594,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Her own voice telling her own wasting woes:
5595,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The sequence of that anguish shall await
5596,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The teaching of thy lips.
5597,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5598,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._           It doth behove
5599,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That thou, Maid Io, shouldst vouchsafe to these"
5600,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The grace they pray,--the more, because they are called"
5601,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy father's sisters: since to open out
5602,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And mourn out grief where it is possible
5603,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To draw a tear from the audience, is a work"
5604,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That pays its own price well.
5605,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5606,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                         I cannot choose
5607,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But trust you, nymphs, and tell you all ye ask,"
5608,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In clear words--though I sob amid my speech
5609,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In speaking of the storm-curse sent from Zeus,"
5610,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And of my beauty, from what height it took"
5611,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Its swoop on me, poor wretch! left thus deformed"
5612,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And monstrous to your eyes. For evermore
5613,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Around my virgin-chamber, wandering went"
5614,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The nightly visions which entreated me
5615,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"With syllabled smooth sweetness.--""Blessed maid,"
5616,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Why lengthen out thy maiden hours when fate
5617,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Permits the noblest spousal in the world?
5618,PROMETHEUS BOUND,When Zeus burns with the arrow of thy love
5619,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And fain would touch thy beauty?--Maiden, thou"
5620,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Despise not Zeus! depart to Lerné's mead
5621,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That's green around thy father's flocks and stalls,"
5622,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Until the passion of the heavenly Eye
5623,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Be quenched in sight."" Such dreams did all night long"
5624,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Constrain me--me, unhappy!--till I dared"
5625,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To tell my father how they trod the dark
5626,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With visionary steps. Whereat he sent
5627,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"His frequent heralds to the Pythian fane,"
5628,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And also to Dodona, and inquired"
5629,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"How best, by act or speech, to please the gods."
5630,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The same returning brought back oracles
5631,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of doubtful sense, indefinite response,"
5632,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Dark to interpret; but at last there came
5633,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To Inachus an answer that was clear,"
5634,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thrown straight as any bolt, and spoken out--"
5635,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"This--""he should drive me from my home and land"
5636,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And bid me wander to the extreme verge
5637,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of all the earth--or, if he willed it not,"
5638,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Should have a thunder with a fiery eye
5639,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Leap straight from Zeus to burn up all his race
5640,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To the last root of it."" By which Loxian word"
5641,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Subdued, he drove me forth and shut me out,"
5642,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"He loth, me loth,--but Zeus's violent bit"
5643,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Compelled him to the deed: when instantly
5644,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"My body and soul were changèd and distraught,"
5645,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And, hornèd as ye see, and spurred along"
5646,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"By the fanged insect, with a maniac leap"
5647,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I rushed on to Cenchrea's limpid stream
5648,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And Lerné's fountain-water. There, the earth-born,"
5649,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The herdsman Argus, most immitigable"
5650,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of wrath, did find me out, and track me out"
5651,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With countless eyes set staring at my steps:
5652,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And though an unexpected sudden doom
5653,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Drew him from life, I, curse-tormented still,"
5654,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Am driven from land to land before the scourge
5655,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The gods hold o'er me. So thou hast heard the past,"
5656,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And if a bitter future thou canst tell,"
5657,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Speak on. I charge thee, do not flatter me"
5658,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Through pity, with false words; for, in my mind,"
5659,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Deceiving works more shame than torturing doth.
5660,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5661,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._
5662,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Ah! silence here!
5663,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Nevermore, nevermore"
5664,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Would I languish for
5665,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The stranger's word
5666,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To thrill in mine ear--
5667,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Nevermore for the wrong and the woe and the fear
5668,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"So hard to behold,"
5669,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"So cruel to bear,"
5670,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Piercing my soul with a double-edged sword
5671,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of a sliding cold.
5672,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Ah Fate! ah me!
5673,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I shudder to see
5674,PROMETHEUS BOUND,This wandering maid in her agony.
5675,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5676,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ Grief is too quick in thee and fear too full:
5677,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Be patient till thou hast learnt the rest.
5678,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5679,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._                               Speak: teach
5680,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To those who are sad already, it seems sweet,"
5681,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"By clear foreknowledge to make perfect, pain."
5682,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5683,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ The boon ye asked me first was lightly won,--"
5684,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For first ye asked the story of this maid's grief
5685,PROMETHEUS BOUND,As her own lips might tell it. Now remains
5686,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To list what other sorrows she so young
5687,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Must bear from Herè. Inachus's child,"
5688,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"O thou! drop down thy soul my weighty words,"
5689,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And measure out the landmarks which are set
5690,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To end thy wandering. Toward the orient sun
5691,PROMETHEUS BOUND,First turn thy face from mine and journey on
5692,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Along the desert flats till thou shalt come
5693,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Where Scythia's shepherd peoples dwell aloft,"
5694,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Perched in wheeled waggons under woven roofs,"
5695,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And twang the rapid arrow past the bow--
5696,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Approach them not; but siding in thy course
5697,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The rugged shore-rocks resonant to the sea,"
5698,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Depart that country. On the left hand dwell
5699,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The iron-workers, called the Chalybes,"
5700,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of whom beware, for certes they are uncouth"
5701,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And nowise bland to strangers. Reaching so
5702,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The stream Hybristes (well the _scorner_ called),"
5703,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Attempt no passage,--it is hard to pass,--"
5704,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Or ere thou come to Caucasus itself,"
5705,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That highest of mountains, where the river leaps"
5706,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The precipice in his strength. Thou must toil up
5707,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Those mountain-tops that neighbour with the stars,"
5708,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And tread the south way, and draw near, at last,"
5709,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The Amazonian host that hateth man,"
5710,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Inhabitants of Themiscyra, close"
5711,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Upon Thermodon, where the sea's rough jaw"
5712,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Doth gnash at Salmydessa and provide
5713,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"A cruel host to seamen, and to ships"
5714,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A stepdame. They with unreluctant hand
5715,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Shall lead thee on and on, till thou arrive"
5716,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Just where the ocean-gates show narrowest
5717,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"On the Cimmerian isthmus. Leaving which,"
5718,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Behoves thee swim with fortitude of soul
5719,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The strait Mæotis. Ay, and evermore"
5720,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That traverse shall be famous on men's lips,"
5721,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That strait, called Bosphorus, the horned-one's road,"
5722,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"So named because of thee, who so wilt pass"
5723,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From Europe's plain to Asia's continent.
5724,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"How think ye, nymphs? the king of gods appears"
5725,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Impartial in ferocious deeds? Behold!
5726,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The god desirous of this mortal's love
5727,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Hath cursed her with these wanderings. Ah, fair child,"
5728,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thou hast met a bitter groom for bridal troth!
5729,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For all thou yet hast heard can only prove
5730,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The incompleted prelude of thy doom.
5731,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5732,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._ Ah, ah!"
5733,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5734,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Is 't thy turn, now, to shriek and moan?"
5735,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"How wilt thou, when thou hast hearkened what remains?"
5736,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5737,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ Besides the grief thou hast told can aught remain?
5738,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5739,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ A sea--of foredoomed evil worked to storm.
5740,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5741,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._ What boots my life, then? why not cast myself"
5742,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Down headlong from this miserable rock,"
5743,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That, dashed against the flats, I may redeem"
5744,PROMETHEUS BOUND,My soul from sorrow? Better once to die
5745,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Than day by day to suffer.
5746,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5747,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._             Verily,"
5748,PROMETHEUS BOUND,It would be hard for thee to bear my woe
5749,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For whom it is appointed not to die.
5750,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Death frees from woe: but I before me see
5751,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In all my far prevision not a bound
5752,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To all I suffer, ere that Zeus shall fall"
5753,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From being a king.
5754,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5755,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                And can it ever be
5756,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That Zeus shall fall from empire?
5757,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5758,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._                       _Thou_, methinks,"
5759,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Wouldst take some joy to see it.
5760,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5761,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                                Could I choose?
5762,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_I_ who endure such pangs now, by that god!"
5763,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5764,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Learn from me, therefore, that the event shall be."
5765,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5766,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._ By whom shall his imperial sceptred hand
5767,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Be emptied so?
5768,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5769,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Himself shall spoil himself,"
5770,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Through his idiotic counsels.
5771,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5772,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                      How? declare:
5773,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Unless the word bring evil.
5774,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5775,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._            He shall wed;
5776,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And in the marriage-bond be joined to grief.
5777,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5778,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._ A heavenly bride--or human? Speak it out
5779,PROMETHEUS BOUND,If it be utterable.
5780,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5781,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._      Why should I say which?
5782,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"It ought not to be uttered, verily."
5783,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5784,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                              Then
5785,PROMETHEUS BOUND,It is his wife shall tear him from his throne?
5786,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5787,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ It is his wife shall bear a son to him,"
5788,PROMETHEUS BOUND,More mighty than the father.
5789,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5790,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                          From this doom
5791,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Hath he no refuge?
5792,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5793,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._       None: or ere that I,"
5794,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Loosed from these fetters--
5795,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5796,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                    Yea--but who shall loose
5797,PROMETHEUS BOUND,While Zeus is adverse?
5798,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5799,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._         One who is born of thee:
5800,PROMETHEUS BOUND,It is ordained so.
5801,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5802,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._             What is this thou sayest?
5803,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A son of mine shall liberate thee from woe?
5804,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5805,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ After ten generations, count three more,"
5806,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And find him in the third.
5807,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5808,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                       The oracle
5809,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Remains obscure.
5810,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5811,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ And search it not, to learn"
5812,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thine own griefs from it.
5813,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5814,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._                 Point me not to a good,"
5815,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To leave me straight bereaved.
5816,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5817,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._               I am prepared
5818,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To grant thee one of two things.
5819,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5820,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Io._                          But which two?
5821,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Set them before me; grant me power to choose.
5822,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5823,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ I grant it, choose now: shall I name aloud"
5824,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"What griefs remain to wound thee, or what hand"
5825,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Shall save me out of mine?
5826,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5827,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus._                   Vouchsafe, O god,"
5828,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The one grace of the twain to her who prays;
5829,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The next to me; and turn back neither prayer
5830,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Dishonour'd by denial. To herself
5831,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Recount the future wandering of her feet;
5832,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Then point me to the looser of thy chain,"
5833,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Because I yearn to know him.
5834,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5835,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._                    Since ye will,"
5836,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of absolute will, this knowledge, I will set"
5837,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"No contrary against it, nor keep back"
5838,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"A word of all ye ask for. Io, first"
5839,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To thee I must relate thy wandering course
5840,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Far winding. As I tell it, write it down"
5841,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In thy soul's book of memories. When thou hast past
5842,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The refluent bound that parts two continents,"
5843,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Track on the footsteps of the orient sun
5844,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In his own fire, across the roar of seas,--"
5845,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Fly till thou hast reached the Gorgonæan flats
5846,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Beside Cisthené. There, the Phorcides,"
5847,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Three ancient maidens, live, with shape of swan,"
5848,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"One tooth between them, and one common eye:"
5849,PROMETHEUS BOUND,On whom the sun doth never look at all
5850,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"With all his rays, nor evermore the moon"
5851,PROMETHEUS BOUND,When she looks through the night. Anear to whom
5852,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Are the Gorgon sisters three, enclothed with wings,"
5853,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"With twisted snakes for ringlets, man-abhorred:"
5854,PROMETHEUS BOUND,There is no mortal gazes in their face
5855,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And gazing can breathe on. I speak of such
5856,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To guard thee from their horror. Ay, and list"
5857,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Another tale of a dreadful sight; beware
5858,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The Griffins, those unbarking dogs of Zeus,"
5859,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Those sharp-mouthed dogs!--and the Arimaspian host
5860,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of one-eyed horsemen, habiting beside"
5861,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The river of Pluto that runs bright with gold:
5862,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Approach them not, beseech thee! Presently"
5863,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thou'lt come to a distant land, a dusky tribe"
5864,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of dwellers at the fountain of the Sun,"
5865,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Whence flows the river Æthiops; wind along
5866,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Its banks and turn off at the cataracts,"
5867,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Just as the Nile pours from the Bybline hills
5868,PROMETHEUS BOUND,His holy and sweet wave; his course shall guide
5869,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thine own to that triangular Nile-ground
5870,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Where, Io, is ordained for thee and thine"
5871,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A lengthened exile. Have I said in this
5872,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Aught darkly or incompletely?--now repeat
5873,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The question, make the knowledge fuller! Lo,"
5874,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I have more leisure than I covet, here."
5875,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5876,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus._ If thou canst tell us aught that's left untold,"
5877,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Or loosely told, of her most dreary flight,"
5878,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Declare it straight: but if thou hast uttered all,"
5879,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Grant us that latter grace for which we prayed,"
5880,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Remembering how we prayed it.
5881,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5882,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                   She has heard
5883,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The uttermost of her wandering. There it ends.
5884,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But that she may be certain not to have heard
5885,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"All vainly, I will speak what she endured"
5886,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Ere coming hither, and invoke the past"
5887,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To prove my prescience true. And so--to leave
5888,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A multitude of words and pass at once
5889,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To the subject of thy course--when thou hadst gone
5890,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To those Molossian plains which sweep around
5891,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Dodona shouldering Heaven, whereby the fane"
5892,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of Zeus Thesprotian keepeth oracle,"
5893,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And, wonder past belief, where oaks do wave"
5894,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Articulate adjurations--(ay, the same"
5895,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Saluted thee in no perplexèd phrase
5896,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But clear with glory, noble wife of Zeus"
5897,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That shouldst be,--there some sweetness took thy sense!)"
5898,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thou didst rush further onward, stung along"
5899,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The ocean-shore, toward Rhea's mighty bay"
5900,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And, tost back from it, wast tost to it again"
5901,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In stormy evolution:--and, know well,"
5902,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In coming time that hollow of the sea
5903,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Shall bear the name Ionian and present
5904,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A monument of Io's passage through
5905,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Unto all mortals. Be these words the signs
5906,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of my soul's power to look beyond the veil
5907,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of visible things. The rest, to you and her"
5908,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I will declare in common audience, nymphs,"
5909,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Returning thither where my speech brake off.
5910,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"There is a town Canobus, built upon"
5911,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The earth's fair margin at the mouth of Nile
5912,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And on the mound washed up by it; Io, there"
5913,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Shall Zeus give back to thee thy perfect mind,"
5914,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And only by the pressure and the touch
5915,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of a hand not terrible; and thou to Zeus
5916,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Shalt bear a dusky son who shall be called
5917,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thence, Epaphus, _Touched_. That son shall pluck the fruit"
5918,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of all that land wide-watered by the flow
5919,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of Nile; but after him, when counting out"
5920,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"As far as the fifth full generation, then"
5921,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Full fifty maidens, a fair woman-race,"
5922,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Shall back to Argos turn reluctantly,"
5923,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To fly the proffered nuptials of their kin,"
5924,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Their father's brothers. These being passion struck,"
5925,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Like falcons bearing hard on flying doves,"
5926,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Shall follow, hunting at a quarry of love"
5927,PROMETHEUS BOUND,They should not hunt; till envious Heaven maintain
5928,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"A curse betwixt that beauty and their desire,"
5929,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And Greece receive them, to be overcome"
5930,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In murtherous woman-war, by fierce red hands"
5931,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Kept savage by the night. For every wife
5932,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Shall slay a husband, dyeing deep in blood"
5933,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The sword of a double edge--(I wish indeed
5934,PROMETHEUS BOUND,As fair a marriage-joy to all my foes!)
5935,PROMETHEUS BOUND,One bride alone shall fail to smite to death
5936,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The head upon her pillow, touched with love,"
5937,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Made impotent of purpose and impelled
5938,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To choose the lesser evil,--shame on her cheeks,"
5939,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Than blood-guilt on her hands: which bride shall bear
5940,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A royal race in Argos. Tedious speech
5941,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Were needed to relate particulars
5942,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of these things; 'tis enough that from her seed
5943,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Shall spring the strong He, famous with the bow,"
5944,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Whose arm shall break my fetters off. Behold,"
5945,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"My mother Themis, that old Titaness,"
5946,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Delivered to me such an oracle,--"
5947,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But how and when, I should be long to speak,"
5948,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And thou, in hearing, wouldst not gain at all."
5949,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5950,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Io._ Eleleu, eleleu!"
5951,PROMETHEUS BOUND,How the spasm and the pain
5952,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And the fire on the brain
5953,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Strike, burning me through!"
5954,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"How the sting of the curse, all aflame as it flew,"
5955,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Pricks me onward again!
5956,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"How my heart in its terror is spurning my breast,"
5957,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And my eyes, like the wheels of a chariot, roll round!"
5958,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I am whirled from my course, to the east, to the west,"
5959,PROMETHEUS BOUND,In the whirlwind of phrensy all madly inwound--
5960,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And my mouth is unbridled for anguish and hate,"
5961,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And my words beat in vain, in wild storms of unrest,"
5962,PROMETHEUS BOUND,On the sea of my desolate fate.
5963,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5964,PROMETHEUS BOUND,[_IO rushes out._
5965,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5966,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus.--Strophe._
5967,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Oh, wise was he, oh, wise was he"
5968,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Who first within his spirit knew
5969,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And with his tongue declared it true
5970,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That love comes best that comes unto
5971,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The equal of degree!
5972,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And that the poor and that the low
5973,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Should seek no love from those above,"
5974,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Whose souls are fluttered with the flow
5975,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of airs about their golden height,"
5976,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Or proud because they see arow
5977,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Ancestral crowns of light.
5978,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5979,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Antistrophe._
5980,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Oh, never, never may ye, Fates,"
5981,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Behold me with your awful eyes
5982,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Lift mine too fondly up the skies
5983,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Where Zeus upon the purple waits!
5984,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Nor let me step too near--too near
5985,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To any suitor, bright from heaven:"
5986,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Because I see, because I fear"
5987,PROMETHEUS BOUND,This loveless maiden vexed and laden
5988,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"By this fell curse of Heré, driven"
5989,PROMETHEUS BOUND,On wanderings dread and drear.
5990,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
5991,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Epode._
5992,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Nay, grant an equal troth instead"
5993,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of nuptial love, to bind me by!"
5994,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"It will not hurt, I shall not dread"
5995,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To meet it in reply.
5996,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But let not love from those above
5997,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Revert and fix me, as I said,"
5998,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With that inevitable Eye!
5999,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I have no sword to fight that fight,"
6000,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I have no strength to tread that path,"
6001,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I know not if my nature hath
6002,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The power to bear, I cannot see"
6003,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Whither from Zeus's infinite
6004,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I have the power to flee.
6005,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6006,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Yet Zeus, albeit most absolute of will,"
6007,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Shall turn to meekness,--such a marriage-rite"
6008,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"He holds in preparation, which anon"
6009,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Shall thrust him headlong from his gerent seat
6010,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Adown the abysmal void, and so the curse"
6011,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"His father Chronos muttered in his fall,"
6012,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"As he fell from his ancient throne and cursed,"
6013,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Shall be accomplished wholly. No escape
6014,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From all that ruin shall the filial Zeus
6015,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Find granted to him from any of his gods,"
6016,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Unless I teach him. I the refuge know,"
6017,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And I, the means. Now, therefore, let him sit"
6018,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And brave the imminent doom, and fix his faith"
6019,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"On his supernal noises, hurtling on"
6020,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With restless hand the bolt that breathes out fire;
6021,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For these things shall not help him, none of them,"
6022,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Nor hinder his perdition when he falls
6023,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To shame, and lower than patience: such a foe"
6024,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"He doth himself prepare against himself,"
6025,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"A wonder of unconquerable hate,"
6026,PROMETHEUS BOUND,An organizer of sublimer fire
6027,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Than glares in lightnings, and of grander sound"
6028,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Than aught the thunder rolls, out-thundering it,"
6029,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With power to shatter in Poseidon's fist
6030,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The trident-spear which, while it plagues the sea,"
6031,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Doth shake the shores around it. Ay, and Zeus,"
6032,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Precipitated thus, shall learn at length"
6033,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The difference betwixt rule and servitude.
6034,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6035,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ Thou makest threats for Zeus of thy desires.
6036,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6037,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ I tell you, all these things shall be fulfilled."
6038,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Even so as I desire them.
6039,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6040,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._                  Must we then
6041,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Look out for one shall come to master Zeus?
6042,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6043,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ These chains weigh lighter than his sorrows shall.
6044,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6045,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ How art thou not afraid to utter such words?
6046,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6047,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ What should _I_ fear who cannot die?
6048,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6049,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._                                            But _he_
6050,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Can visit thee with dreader woe than death's.
6051,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6052,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Why, let him do it! I am here, prepared"
6053,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For all things and their pangs.
6054,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6055,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._                      The wise are they
6056,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Who reverence Adrasteia.
6057,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6058,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._              Reverence thou,"
6059,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Adore thou, flatter thou, whomever reigns,"
6060,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Whenever reigning! but for me, your Zeus"
6061,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Is less than nothing. Let him act and reign
6062,PROMETHEUS BOUND,His brief hour out according to his will--
6063,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"He will not, therefore, rule the gods too long."
6064,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But lo! I see that courier-god of Zeus,"
6065,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That new-made menial of the new-crowned king:
6066,PROMETHEUS BOUND,He doubtless comes to announce to us something new.
6067,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6068,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_HERMES enters._
6069,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6070,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hermes._ I speak to thee, the sophist, the talker-down"
6071,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of scorn by scorn, the sinner against gods,"
6072,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The reverencer of men, the thief of fire,--"
6073,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I speak to thee and adjure thee! Zeus requires
6074,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy declaration of what marriage-rite
6075,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thus moves thy vaunt and shall hereafter cause
6076,PROMETHEUS BOUND,His fall from empire. Do not wrap thy speech
6077,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In riddles, but speak clearly! Never cast"
6078,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Ambiguous paths, Prometheus, for my feet,"
6079,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Since Zeus, thou mayst perceive, is scarcely won"
6080,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To mercy by such means.
6081,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6082,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._               A speech well-mouthed
6083,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In the utterance, and full-minded in the sense,"
6084,PROMETHEUS BOUND,As doth befit a servant of the gods!
6085,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"New gods, ye newly reign, and think forsooth"
6086,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Ye dwell in towers too high for any dart
6087,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To carry a wound there!--have I not stood by
6088,PROMETHEUS BOUND,While two kings fell from thence? and shall I not
6089,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Behold the third, the same who rules you now,"
6090,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Fall, shamed to sudden ruin?--Do I seem"
6091,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To tremble and quail before your modern gods?
6092,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Far be it from me!--For thyself, depart,"
6093,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Re-tread thy steps in haste. To all thou hast asked
6094,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I answer nothing.
6095,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6096,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hermes._           Such a wind of pride
6097,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Impelled thee of yore full-sail upon these rocks.
6098,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6099,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._ I would not barter---learn thou soothly that!--
6100,PROMETHEUS BOUND,My suffering for thy service. I maintain
6101,PROMETHEUS BOUND,It is a nobler thing to serve these rocks
6102,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Than live a faithful slave to father Zeus.
6103,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thus upon scorners I retort their scorn.
6104,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6105,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hermes._ It seems that thou dost glory in thy despair.
6106,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6107,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ I glory? would my foes did glory so,"
6108,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And I stood by to see them!--naming whom,"
6109,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thou art not unremembered.
6110,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6111,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hermes._                     Dost thou charge
6112,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Me also with the blame of thy mischance?
6113,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6114,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ I tell thee I loathe the universal gods,"
6115,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Who for the good I gave them rendered back
6116,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The ill of their injustice.
6117,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6118,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hermes._                  Thou art mad--
6119,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Thou art raving, Titan, at the fever-height."
6120,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6121,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ If it be madness to abhor my foes,"
6122,PROMETHEUS BOUND,May I be mad!
6123,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6124,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hermes._       If thou wert prosperous
6125,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thou wouldst be unendurable.
6126,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6127,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                      Alas!
6128,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6129,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hermes._ Zeus knows not that word.
6130,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6131,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                      But maturing Time
6132,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Teaches all things.
6133,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6134,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hermes._        Howbeit, thou hast not learnt"
6135,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The wisdom yet, thou needest."
6136,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6137,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._                    If I had,"
6138,PROMETHEUS BOUND,I should not talk thus with a slave like thee.
6139,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6140,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hermes._ No answer thou vouchsafest, I believe,"
6141,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To the great Sire's requirement.
6142,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6143,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                   Verily
6144,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I owe him grateful service,--and should pay it."
6145,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6146,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hermes._ Why, thou dost mock me, Titan, as I stood"
6147,PROMETHEUS BOUND,A child before thy face.
6148,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6149,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._            No child, forsooth,"
6150,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"But yet more foolish than a foolish child,"
6151,PROMETHEUS BOUND,If thou expect that I should answer aught
6152,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Thy Zeus can ask. No torture from his hand
6153,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Nor any machination in the world
6154,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Shall force mine utterance ere he loose, himself,"
6155,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"These cankerous fetters from me. For the rest,"
6156,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Let him now hurl his blanching lightnings down,"
6157,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And with his white-winged snows and mutterings deep
6158,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of subterranean thunders mix all things,"
6159,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Confound them in disorder. None of this
6160,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Shall bend my sturdy will and make me speak
6161,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The name of his dethroner who shall come.
6162,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6163,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Hermes._ Can this avail thee? Look to it!
6164,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6165,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._                             Long ago
6166,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"It was looked forward to, precounselled of."
6167,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6168,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hermes._ Vain god, take righteous courage! dare for once"
6169,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To apprehend and front thine agonies
6170,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With a just prudence.
6171,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6172,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Prometheus._          Vainly dost thou chafe
6173,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"My soul with exhortation, as yonder sea"
6174,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Goes beating on the rock. Oh, think no more"
6175,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"That I, fear-struck by Zeus to a woman's mind,"
6176,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Will supplicate him, loathèd as he is,"
6177,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"With feminine upliftings of my hands,"
6178,PROMETHEUS BOUND,To break these chains. Far from me be the thought!
6179,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6180,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hermes._ I have indeed, methinks, said much in vain,"
6181,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For still thy heart beneath my showers of prayers
6182,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Lies dry and hard--nay, leaps like a young horse"
6183,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Who bites against the new bit in his teeth,"
6184,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And tugs and struggles against the new-tried rein,--"
6185,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Still fiercest in the feeblest thing of all,"
6186,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Which sophism is; since absolute will disjoined
6187,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"From perfect mind is worse than weak. Behold,"
6188,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Unless my words persuade thee, what a blast"
6189,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And whirlwind of inevitable woe
6190,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Must sweep persuasion through thee! For at first
6191,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The Father will split up this jut of rock
6192,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With the great thunder and the bolted flame
6193,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And hide thy body where a hinge of stone
6194,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Shall catch it like an arm; and when thou hast passed
6195,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"A long black time within, thou shalt come out"
6196,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To front the sun while Zeus's winged hound,"
6197,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The strong carnivorous eagle, shall wheel down"
6198,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To meet thee, self-called to a daily feast,"
6199,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And set his fierce beak in thee and tear off
6200,PROMETHEUS BOUND,The long rags of thy flesh and batten deep
6201,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Upon thy dusky liver. Do not look
6202,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For any end moreover to this curse
6203,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Or ere some god appear, to accept thy pangs"
6204,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"On his own head vicarious, and descend"
6205,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With unreluctant step the darks of hell
6206,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And gloomy abysses around Tartarus.
6207,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Then ponder this--this threat is not a growth
6208,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of vain invention; it is spoken and meant;
6209,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"King Zeus's mouth is impotent to lie,"
6210,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Consummating the utterance by the act;
6211,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"So, look to it, thou! take heed, and nevermore"
6212,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Forget good counsel, to indulge self-will."
6213,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6214,PROMETHEUS BOUND,_Chorus._ Our Hermes suits his reasons to the times;
6215,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"At least I think so, since he bids thee drop"
6216,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Self-will for prudent counsel. Yield to him!
6217,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"When the wise err, their wisdom makes their shame."
6218,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6219,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Unto me the foreknower, this mandate of power"
6220,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"He cries, to reveal it."
6221,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"What's strange in my fate, if I suffer from hate"
6222,PROMETHEUS BOUND,At the hour that I feel it?
6223,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Let the locks of the lightning, all bristling and whitening,"
6224,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Flash, coiling me round,"
6225,PROMETHEUS BOUND,While the æther goes surging 'neath thunder and scourging
6226,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Of wild winds unbound!
6227,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Let the blast of the firmament whirl from its place
6228,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"The earth rooted below,"
6229,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And the brine of the ocean, in rapid emotion,"
6230,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Be driven in the face
6231,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Of the stars up in heaven, as they walk to and fro!"
6232,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Let him hurl me anon into Tartarus--on--
6233,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"To the blackest degree,"
6234,PROMETHEUS BOUND,With Necessity's vortices strangling me down;
6235,PROMETHEUS BOUND,But he cannot join death to a fate meant for _me_!
6236,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6237,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hermes._ Why, the words that he speaks and the thoughts that he thinks"
6238,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Are maniacal!--add,"
6239,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"If the Fate who hath bound him should loose not the links,"
6240,PROMETHEUS BOUND,He were utterly mad.
6241,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Then depart ye who groan with him,"
6242,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Leaving to moan with him,--"
6243,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Go in haste! lest the roar of the thunder anearing
6244,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Should blast you to idiocy, living and hearing."
6245,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6246,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Chorus._ Change thy speech for another, thy thought for a new,"
6247,PROMETHEUS BOUND,If to move me and teach me indeed be thy care!
6248,PROMETHEUS BOUND,For thy words swerve so far from the loyal and true
6249,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That the thunder of Zeus seems more easy to bear.
6250,PROMETHEUS BOUND,How! couldst teach me to venture such vileness? behold!
6251,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I _choose_, with this victim, this anguish foretold!"
6252,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"I recoil from the traitor in hate and disdain,"
6253,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And I know that the curse of the treason is worse
6254,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Than the pang of the chain.
6255,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6256,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Hermes._ Then remember, O nymphs, what I tell you before,"
6257,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Nor, when pierced by the arrows that Até will throw you,"
6258,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Cast blame on your fate and declare evermore
6259,PROMETHEUS BOUND,That Zeus thrust you on anguish he did not foreshow you.
6260,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Nay, verily, nay! for ye perish anon"
6261,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"For your deed--by your choice. By no blindness of doubt,"
6262,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"No abruptness of doom, but by madness alone,"
6263,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"In the great net of Até, whence none cometh out,"
6264,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Ye are wound and undone.
6265,PROMETHEUS BOUND,
6266,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"_Prometheus._ Ay! in act now, in word now no more,"
6267,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Earth is rocking in space.
6268,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And the thunders crash up with a roar upon roar,"
6269,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And the eddying lightnings flash fire in my face,"
6270,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And the whirlwinds are whirling the dust round and round,"
6271,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And the blasts of the winds universal leap free
6272,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"And blow each upon each with a passion of sound,"
6273,PROMETHEUS BOUND,And æther goes mingling in storm with the sea.
6274,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"Such a curse on my head, in a manifest dread,"
6275,PROMETHEUS BOUND,From the hand of your Zeus has been hurtled along.
6276,PROMETHEUS BOUND,"O my mother's fair glory! O Æther, enringing"
6277,PROMETHEUS BOUND,All eyes with the sweet common light of thy bringing!
6278,PROMETHEUS BOUND,Dost see how I suffer this wrong?

6303,II.,"Cytherea grows mad at his thin gasping breath,"

6319,III.,"And the poor Aphrodité, with tresses unbound,"

6321,III.,"Through the dusk of the groves. The thorns, tearing her feet,"
6322,III.,"Gather up the red flower of her blood which is holy,"

6406,VII.,The Loves raised their voices around him and wept.
6407,VII.,They have shorn their bright curls off to cast on Adonis;
6408,VII.,"One treads on his bow,--on his arrows, another,--"
6409,VII.,"One breaks up a well-feathered quiver, and one is"
6410,VII.,"Bent low at a sandal, untying the strings,"
6411,VII.,"And one carries the vases of gold from the springs,"
6412,VII.,"While one washes the wound,--and behind them a brother"
6413,VII.,Fans down on the body sweet air with his wings.

6417,VIII.,
6418,VIII.,Cytherea herself now the Loves are lamenting
6419,VIII.,Each torch at the door Hymenæus blew out;
6420,VIII.,"And, the marriage-wreath dropping its leaves as repenting,"
6421,VIII.,"No more ""Hymen, Hymen,"" is chanted about,"
6422,VIII.,"But the _ai ai_ instead--""Ai alas!"" is begun"
6423,VIII.,"For Adonis, and then follows ""Ai Hymenæus!"""
6424,VIII.,"The Graces are weeping for Cinyris' son,"
6425,VIII.,"Sobbing low each to each, ""His fair eyes cannot see us!"""
6426,VIII.,Their wail strikes more shrill than the sadder Dioné's.
6427,VIII.,"The Fates mourn aloud for Adonis, Adonis,"
6428,VIII.,Deep chanting; he hears not a word that they say:
6429,VIII.,"He _would_ hear, but Persephoné has him in keeping."
6430,VIII.,"--Cease moan, Cytherea! leave pomps for to-day,"
6431,VIII.,And weep new when a new year refits thee for weeping.

6458,A VISION OF POETS.,
6459,A VISION OF POETS.,
6460,A VISION OF POETS.,"A poet could not sleep aright,"
6461,A VISION OF POETS.,For his soul kept up too much light
6462,A VISION OF POETS.,Under his eyelids for the night.
6463,A VISION OF POETS.,
6464,A VISION OF POETS.,And thus he rose disquieted
6465,A VISION OF POETS.,"With sweet rhymes ringing through his head,"
6466,A VISION OF POETS.,And in the forest wanderèd
6467,A VISION OF POETS.,
6468,A VISION OF POETS.,"Where, sloping up the darkest glades,"
6469,A VISION OF POETS.,The moon had drawn long colonnades
6470,A VISION OF POETS.,Upon whose floor the verdure fades
6471,A VISION OF POETS.,
6472,A VISION OF POETS.,"To a faint silver: pavement fair,"
6473,A VISION OF POETS.,The antique wood-nymphs scarce would dare
6474,A VISION OF POETS.,"To foot-print o'er, had such been there,"

6476,A VISION OF POETS.,"And rather sit by breathlessly,"
6477,A VISION OF POETS.,"With fear in their large eyes, to see"
6478,A VISION OF POETS.,The consecrated sight. But HE--
6479,A VISION OF POETS.,
6480,A VISION OF POETS.,"The poet who, with spirit-kiss"
6481,A VISION OF POETS.,"Familiar, had long claimed for his"
6482,A VISION OF POETS.,"Whatever earthly beauty is,"
6483,A VISION OF POETS.,
6484,A VISION OF POETS.,Who also in his spirit bore
6485,A VISION OF POETS.,"A beauty passing the earth's store,--"
6486,A VISION OF POETS.,Walked calmly onward evermore.
6487,A VISION OF POETS.,
6488,A VISION OF POETS.,"His aimless thoughts in metre went,"
6489,A VISION OF POETS.,Like a babe's hand without intent
6490,A VISION OF POETS.,Drawn down a seven-stringed instrument:
6491,A VISION OF POETS.,
6492,A VISION OF POETS.,"Nor jarred it with his humour as,"
6493,A VISION OF POETS.,"With a faint stirring of the grass,"
6494,A VISION OF POETS.,An apparition fair did pass.
6495,A VISION OF POETS.,
6496,A VISION OF POETS.,"He might have feared another time,"
6497,A VISION OF POETS.,But all things fair and strange did chime
6498,A VISION OF POETS.,"With his thoughts then, as rhyme to rhyme."
6499,A VISION OF POETS.,
6500,A VISION OF POETS.,"An angel had not startled him,"
6501,A VISION OF POETS.,Alighted from heaven's burning rim
6502,A VISION OF POETS.,To breathe from glory in the Dim;

6504,A VISION OF POETS.,Much less a lady riding slow

6511,A VISION OF POETS.,
6512,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Of some fair Dryad of old tales"

6515,A VISION OF POETS.,
6516,A VISION OF POETS.,She smiled; but he could see arise
6517,A VISION OF POETS.,"Her soul from far adown her eyes,"
6518,A VISION OF POETS.,Prepared as if for sacrifice.
6519,A VISION OF POETS.,
6520,A VISION OF POETS.,She looked a queen who seemeth gay
6521,A VISION OF POETS.,"From royal grace alone. ""Now, nay,"""
6522,A VISION OF POETS.,"He answered, ""slumber passed away,"
6523,A VISION OF POETS.,
6524,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Compelled by instincts in my head"

6528,A VISION OF POETS.,She looked up quickly to the sky
6529,A VISION OF POETS.,"And spake: ""The moon's regality"
6530,A VISION OF POETS.,Will hear no praise; She is as I.
6531,A VISION OF POETS.,
6532,A VISION OF POETS.,"""She is in heaven, and I on earth;"

6534,A VISION OF POETS.,"To crown all poets to their worth."""
6535,A VISION OF POETS.,
6536,A VISION OF POETS.,He brake in with a voice that mourned;
6537,A VISION OF POETS.,"""To their worth, lady? They are scorned"
6538,A VISION OF POETS.,"By men they sing for, till inurned."
6539,A VISION OF POETS.,
6540,A VISION OF POETS.,"""To their worth? Beauty in the mind"
6541,A VISION OF POETS.,"Leaves the hearth cold, and love-refined"
6542,A VISION OF POETS.,Ambitions make the world unkind.
6543,A VISION OF POETS.,
6544,A VISION OF POETS.,"""The boor who ploughs the daisy down,"
6545,A VISION OF POETS.,"The chief whose mortgage of renown,"
6546,A VISION OF POETS.,"Fixed upon graves, has bought a crown--"
6547,A VISION OF POETS.,
6548,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Both these are happier, more approved"
6549,A VISION OF POETS.,Than poets!--why should I be moved
6550,A VISION OF POETS.,"In saying, both are more beloved?"""
6551,A VISION OF POETS.,
6552,A VISION OF POETS.,"""The south can judge not of the north,"""
6553,A VISION OF POETS.,"She resumed calmly; ""I come forth"
6554,A VISION OF POETS.,To crown all poets to their worth.
6555,A VISION OF POETS.,
6556,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Yea, verily, to anoint them all"
6557,A VISION OF POETS.,With blessed oils which surely shall
6558,A VISION OF POETS.,"Smell sweeter as the ages fall."""
6559,A VISION OF POETS.,
6560,A VISION OF POETS.,"""As sweet,"" the poet said, and rung"
6561,A VISION OF POETS.,"A low sad laugh, ""as flowers are, sprung"
6562,A VISION OF POETS.,Out of their graves when they die young;
6563,A VISION OF POETS.,
6564,A VISION OF POETS.,"""As sweet as window-eglantine,"
6565,A VISION OF POETS.,"Some bough of which, as they decline,"
6566,A VISION OF POETS.,The hired nurse gathers at their sign:
6567,A VISION OF POETS.,
6568,A VISION OF POETS.,"""As sweet, in short, as perfumed shroud"
6569,A VISION OF POETS.,Which the gay Roman maidens sewed
6570,A VISION OF POETS.,"For English Keats, singing aloud."""
6571,A VISION OF POETS.,
6572,A VISION OF POETS.,"The lady answered, ""Yea, as sweet!"
6573,A VISION OF POETS.,The things thou namest being complete
6574,A VISION OF POETS.,"In fragrance, as I measure it."
6575,A VISION OF POETS.,
6576,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Since sweet the death-clothes and the knell"
6577,A VISION OF POETS.,"Of him who having lived, dies well;"
6578,A VISION OF POETS.,And wholly sweet the asphodel
6579,A VISION OF POETS.,
6580,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Stirred softly by that foot of his,"
6581,A VISION OF POETS.,"When he treads brave on all that is,"
6582,A VISION OF POETS.,"Into the world of souls, from this."
6583,A VISION OF POETS.,
6584,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Since sweet the tears, dropped at the door"
6585,A VISION OF POETS.,"Of tearless Death, and even before:"
6586,A VISION OF POETS.,"Sweet, consecrated evermore."
6587,A VISION OF POETS.,
6588,A VISION OF POETS.,"""What, dost thou judge it a strange thing"
6589,A VISION OF POETS.,"That poets, crowned for vanquishing,"
6590,A VISION OF POETS.,Should bear some dust from out the ring?
6591,A VISION OF POETS.,
6592,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Come on with me, come on with me,"
6593,A VISION OF POETS.,And learn in coming: let me free
6594,A VISION OF POETS.,"Thy spirit into verity."""
6595,A VISION OF POETS.,
6596,A VISION OF POETS.,She ceased: her palfrey's paces sent
6597,A VISION OF POETS.,No separate noises as she went;
6598,A VISION OF POETS.,"'Twas a bee's hum, a little spent."
6599,A VISION OF POETS.,
6600,A VISION OF POETS.,And while the poet seemed to tread
6601,A VISION OF POETS.,"Along the drowsy noise so made,"
6602,A VISION OF POETS.,The forest heaved up overhead
6603,A VISION OF POETS.,
6604,A VISION OF POETS.,"Its billowy foliage through the air,"
6605,A VISION OF POETS.,And the calm stars did far and spare
6606,A VISION OF POETS.,O'erswim the masses everywhere
6607,A VISION OF POETS.,
6608,A VISION OF POETS.,Save when the overtopping pines
6609,A VISION OF POETS.,Did bar their tremulous light with lines
6610,A VISION OF POETS.,All fixed and black. Now the moon shines
6611,A VISION OF POETS.,
6612,A VISION OF POETS.,A broader glory. You may see
6613,A VISION OF POETS.,The trees grow rarer presently;
6614,A VISION OF POETS.,The air blows up more fresh and free:
6615,A VISION OF POETS.,
6616,A VISION OF POETS.,"Until they come from dark to light,"
6617,A VISION OF POETS.,And from the forest to the sight
6618,A VISION OF POETS.,"Of the large heaven-heart, bare with night,"
6619,A VISION OF POETS.,
6620,A VISION OF POETS.,"A fiery throb in every star,"
6621,A VISION OF POETS.,Those burning arteries that are
6622,A VISION OF POETS.,"The conduits of God's life afar,--"
6623,A VISION OF POETS.,
6624,A VISION OF POETS.,"A wild brown moorland underneath,"
6625,A VISION OF POETS.,And four pools breaking up the heath
6626,A VISION OF POETS.,"With white low gleamings, blank as death."
6627,A VISION OF POETS.,
6628,A VISION OF POETS.,"Beside the first pool, near the wood,"
6629,A VISION OF POETS.,"A dead tree in set horror stood,"
6630,A VISION OF POETS.,"Peeled and disjointed, stark as rood;"
6631,A VISION OF POETS.,
6632,A VISION OF POETS.,"Since thunder-stricken, years ago,"
6633,A VISION OF POETS.,Fixed in the spectral strain and throe
6634,A VISION OF POETS.,Wherewith it struggled from the blow:
6635,A VISION OF POETS.,
6636,A VISION OF POETS.,"A monumental tree, alone,"
6637,A VISION OF POETS.,"That will not bend in storms, nor groan,"
6638,A VISION OF POETS.,But break off sudden like a stone.
6639,A VISION OF POETS.,
6640,A VISION OF POETS.,Its lifeless shadow lies oblique
6641,A VISION OF POETS.,"Upon the pool where, javelin-like,"
6642,A VISION OF POETS.,The star-rays quiver while they strike.
6643,A VISION OF POETS.,
6644,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Drink,"" said the lady, very still--"
6645,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Be holy and cold."" He did her will"
6646,A VISION OF POETS.,And drank the starry water chill.
6647,A VISION OF POETS.,
6648,A VISION OF POETS.,The next pool they came near unto
6649,A VISION OF POETS.,"Was bare of trees; there, only grew"
6650,A VISION OF POETS.,"Straight flags, and lilies just a few"
6651,A VISION OF POETS.,
6652,A VISION OF POETS.,Which sullen on the water sate
6653,A VISION OF POETS.,"And leant their faces on the flat,"
6654,A VISION OF POETS.,As weary of the starlight-state.
6655,A VISION OF POETS.,
6656,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Drink,"" said the lady, grave and slow--"
6657,A VISION OF POETS.,"""_World's use_ behoveth thee to know."""
6658,A VISION OF POETS.,He drank the bitter wave below.
6659,A VISION OF POETS.,
6660,A VISION OF POETS.,"The third pool, girt with thorny bushes"
6661,A VISION OF POETS.,And flaunting weeds and reeds and rushes
6662,A VISION OF POETS.,"That winds sang through in mournful gushes,"
6663,A VISION OF POETS.,
6664,A VISION OF POETS.,Was whitely smeared in many a round
6665,A VISION OF POETS.,By a slow slime; the starlight swound
6666,A VISION OF POETS.,Over the ghastly light it found.
6667,A VISION OF POETS.,
6668,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Drink,"" said the lady, sad and slow--"
6669,A VISION OF POETS.,"""_World's love_ behoveth thee to know."""
6670,A VISION OF POETS.,He looked to her commanding so;
6671,A VISION OF POETS.,
6672,A VISION OF POETS.,"Her brow was troubled, but her eye"
6673,A VISION OF POETS.,Struck clear to his soul. For all reply
6674,A VISION OF POETS.,"He drank the water suddenly,--"
6675,A VISION OF POETS.,
6676,A VISION OF POETS.,"Then, with a deathly sickness, passed"
6677,A VISION OF POETS.,"Beside the fourth pool and the last,"
6678,A VISION OF POETS.,Where weights of shadow were downcast
6679,A VISION OF POETS.,
6680,A VISION OF POETS.,From yew and alder and rank trails
6681,A VISION OF POETS.,Of nightshade clasping the trunk-scales
6682,A VISION OF POETS.,And flung across the intervals
6683,A VISION OF POETS.,
6684,A VISION OF POETS.,From yew to yew: who dares to stoop
6685,A VISION OF POETS.,"Where those dank branches overdroop,"
6686,A VISION OF POETS.,"Into his heart the chill strikes up,"
6687,A VISION OF POETS.,
6688,A VISION OF POETS.,"He hears a silent gliding coil,"
6689,A VISION OF POETS.,"The snakes strain hard against the soil,"
6690,A VISION OF POETS.,"His foot slips in their slimy oil,"
6691,A VISION OF POETS.,
6692,A VISION OF POETS.,"And toads seem crawling on his hand,"
6693,A VISION OF POETS.,And clinging bats but dimly scanned
6694,A VISION OF POETS.,Full in his face their wings expand.
6695,A VISION OF POETS.,
6696,A VISION OF POETS.,A paleness took the poet's cheek:
6697,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Must I drink _here_?"" he seemed to seek"
6698,A VISION OF POETS.,The lady's will with utterance meek:
6699,A VISION OF POETS.,
6700,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Ay, ay,"" she said, ""it so must be;"""
6701,A VISION OF POETS.,(And this time she spake cheerfully)
6702,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Behoves thee know _World's cruelty_."""
6703,A VISION OF POETS.,
6704,A VISION OF POETS.,He bowed his forehead till his mouth
6705,A VISION OF POETS.,"Curved in the wave, and drank unloth"
6706,A VISION OF POETS.,As if from rivers of the south;
6707,A VISION OF POETS.,
6708,A VISION OF POETS.,"His lips sobbed through the water rank,"
6709,A VISION OF POETS.,"His heart paused in him while he drank,"
6710,A VISION OF POETS.,"His brain beat heart-like, rose and sank,"
6711,A VISION OF POETS.,
6712,A VISION OF POETS.,And he swooned backward to a dream
6713,A VISION OF POETS.,"Wherein he lay 'twixt gloom and gleam,"
6714,A VISION OF POETS.,With Death and Life at each extreme:
6715,A VISION OF POETS.,
6716,A VISION OF POETS.,"And spiritual thunders, born of soul"
6717,A VISION OF POETS.,"Not cloud, did leap from mystic pole"
6718,A VISION OF POETS.,"And o'er him roll and counter-roll,"
6719,A VISION OF POETS.,
6720,A VISION OF POETS.,Crushing their echoes reboant
6721,A VISION OF POETS.,With their own wheels. Did Heaven so grant
6722,A VISION OF POETS.,His spirit a sign of covenant?
6723,A VISION OF POETS.,
6724,A VISION OF POETS.,At last came silence. A slow kiss
6725,A VISION OF POETS.,Did crown his forehead after this;
6726,A VISION OF POETS.,His eyelids flew back for the bliss--
6727,A VISION OF POETS.,
6728,A VISION OF POETS.,"The lady stood beside his head,"
6729,A VISION OF POETS.,"Smiling a thought, with hair dispread;"
6730,A VISION OF POETS.,The moonshine seemed dishevellèd
6731,A VISION OF POETS.,
6732,A VISION OF POETS.,In her sleek tresses manifold
6733,A VISION OF POETS.,Like Danaë's in the rain of old
6734,A VISION OF POETS.,That dripped with melancholy gold:
6735,A VISION OF POETS.,
6736,A VISION OF POETS.,"But SHE was holy, pale and high"
6737,A VISION OF POETS.,As one who saw an ecstasy
6738,A VISION OF POETS.,Beyond a foretold agony.
6739,A VISION OF POETS.,
6740,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Rise up!"" said she with voice where song"
6741,A VISION OF POETS.,"Eddied through speech, ""rise up; be strong:"
6742,A VISION OF POETS.,"And learn how right avenges wrong."""
6743,A VISION OF POETS.,
6744,A VISION OF POETS.,The poet rose up on his feet:
6745,A VISION OF POETS.,He stood before an altar set
6746,A VISION OF POETS.,For sacrament with vessels meet
6747,A VISION OF POETS.,
6748,A VISION OF POETS.,And mystic altar-lights which shine
6749,A VISION OF POETS.,As if their flames were crystalline
6750,A VISION OF POETS.,Carved flames that would not shrink or pine.
6751,A VISION OF POETS.,
6752,A VISION OF POETS.,The altar filled the central place
6753,A VISION OF POETS.,"Of a great church, and toward its face"
6754,A VISION OF POETS.,"Long aisles did shoot and interlace,"
6755,A VISION OF POETS.,
6756,A VISION OF POETS.,And from it a continuous mist
6757,A VISION OF POETS.,Of incense (round the edges kissed
6758,A VISION OF POETS.,By a yellow light of amethyst)
6759,A VISION OF POETS.,
6760,A VISION OF POETS.,"Wound upward slowly and throbbingly,"
6761,A VISION OF POETS.,"Cloud within cloud, right silverly,"
6762,A VISION OF POETS.,"Cloud above cloud, victoriously,--"
6763,A VISION OF POETS.,
6764,A VISION OF POETS.,Broke full against the archèd roof
6765,A VISION OF POETS.,And thence refracting eddied off
6766,A VISION OF POETS.,And floated through the marble woof
6767,A VISION OF POETS.,
6768,A VISION OF POETS.,"Of many a fine-wrought architrave,"
6769,A VISION OF POETS.,"Then, poising its white masses brave,"
6770,A VISION OF POETS.,Swept solemnly down aisle and nave
6771,A VISION OF POETS.,
6772,A VISION OF POETS.,"Where, now in dark and now in light,"
6773,A VISION OF POETS.,"The countless columns, glimmering white,"
6774,A VISION OF POETS.,Seemed leading out to the Infinite:
6775,A VISION OF POETS.,
6776,A VISION OF POETS.,"Plunged halfway up the shaft, they showed"
6777,A VISION OF POETS.,In that pale shifting incense-cloud
6778,A VISION OF POETS.,Which flowed them by and overflowed
6779,A VISION OF POETS.,
6780,A VISION OF POETS.,Till mist and marble seemed to blend
6781,A VISION OF POETS.,"And the whole temple, at the end,"
6782,A VISION OF POETS.,"With its own incense to distend,--"
6783,A VISION OF POETS.,
6784,A VISION OF POETS.,The arches like a giant's bow
6785,A VISION OF POETS.,"To bend and slacken,--and below,"
6786,A VISION OF POETS.,The nichèd saints to come and go:
6787,A VISION OF POETS.,
6788,A VISION OF POETS.,Alone amid the shifting scene
6789,A VISION OF POETS.,That central altar stood serene
6790,A VISION OF POETS.,In its clear steadfast taper-sheen.
6791,A VISION OF POETS.,
6792,A VISION OF POETS.,"Then first, the poet was aware"
6793,A VISION OF POETS.,Of a chief angel standing there
6794,A VISION OF POETS.,"Before that altar, in the glare."
6795,A VISION OF POETS.,
6796,A VISION OF POETS.,"His eyes were dreadful, for you saw"
6797,A VISION OF POETS.,That _they_ saw God; his lips and jaw
6798,A VISION OF POETS.,"Grand-made and strong, as Sinai's law"
6799,A VISION OF POETS.,
6800,A VISION OF POETS.,They could enunciate and refrain
6801,A VISION OF POETS.,"From vibratory after-pain,"

7204,A VISION OF POETS.,
7205,A VISION OF POETS.,Content! it sounded like _Amen_
7206,A VISION OF POETS.,Said by a choir of mourning men;
7207,A VISION OF POETS.,An affirmation full of pain
7208,A VISION OF POETS.,
7209,A VISION OF POETS.,"And patience,--ay, of glorying"
7210,A VISION OF POETS.,"And adoration, as a king"
7211,A VISION OF POETS.,Might seal an oath for governing.
7212,A VISION OF POETS.,
7213,A VISION OF POETS.,Then said the angel--and his face
7214,A VISION OF POETS.,Lightened abroad until the place
7215,A VISION OF POETS.,"Grew larger for a moment's space,--"
7216,A VISION OF POETS.,
7217,A VISION OF POETS.,"The long aisles flashing out in light,"
7218,A VISION OF POETS.,"And nave and transept, columns white"
7219,A VISION OF POETS.,"And arches crossed, being clear to sight"
7220,A VISION OF POETS.,
7221,A VISION OF POETS.,As if the roof were off and all
7222,A VISION OF POETS.,"Stood in the noon-sun,--""Lo, I call"
7223,A VISION OF POETS.,To other hearts as liberal.
7224,A VISION OF POETS.,
7225,A VISION OF POETS.,"""This pedal strikes out in the air:"

7229,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Herein is room, and shall be room"
7230,A VISION OF POETS.,"While Time lasts, for new hearts to come"
7231,A VISION OF POETS.,Consummating while they consume.

7235,A VISION OF POETS.,"The tune?--The race is to the swift."""
7236,A VISION OF POETS.,
7237,A VISION OF POETS.,"So asked the angel. Straight the while,"
7238,A VISION OF POETS.,A company came up the aisle
7239,A VISION OF POETS.,With measured step and sorted smile;
7240,A VISION OF POETS.,
7241,A VISION OF POETS.,"Cleaving the incense-clouds that rise,"
7242,A VISION OF POETS.,With winking unaccustomed eyes
7243,A VISION OF POETS.,And love-locks smelling sweet of spice.
7244,A VISION OF POETS.,
7245,A VISION OF POETS.,One bore his head above the rest
7246,A VISION OF POETS.,"As if the world were dispossessed,"
7247,A VISION OF POETS.,"And one did pillow chin on breast,"
7248,A VISION OF POETS.,
7249,A VISION OF POETS.,"Right languid, an as he should faint;"
7250,A VISION OF POETS.,One shook his curls across his paint
7251,A VISION OF POETS.,And moralized on worldly taint;
7252,A VISION OF POETS.,
7253,A VISION OF POETS.,"One, slanting up his face, did wink"
7254,A VISION OF POETS.,"The salt rheum to the eyelid's brink,"
7255,A VISION OF POETS.,To think--O gods! or--not to think.
7256,A VISION OF POETS.,
7257,A VISION OF POETS.,"Some trod out stealthily and slow,"
7258,A VISION OF POETS.,As if the sun would fall in snow
7259,A VISION OF POETS.,If they walked to instead of fro;
7260,A VISION OF POETS.,
7261,A VISION OF POETS.,"And some, with conscious ambling free,"
7262,A VISION OF POETS.,Did shake their bells right daintily
7263,A VISION OF POETS.,"On hand and foot, for harmony;"
7264,A VISION OF POETS.,
7265,A VISION OF POETS.,"And some, composing sudden sighs"
7266,A VISION OF POETS.,"In attitudes of point-device,"
7267,A VISION OF POETS.,Rehearsed impromptu agonies.
7268,A VISION OF POETS.,
7269,A VISION OF POETS.,And when this company drew near
7270,A VISION OF POETS.,"The spirits crowned, it might appear"
7271,A VISION OF POETS.,Submitted to a ghastly fear;
7272,A VISION OF POETS.,
7273,A VISION OF POETS.,As a sane eye in master-passion
7274,A VISION OF POETS.,Constrains a maniac to the fashion
7275,A VISION OF POETS.,Of hideous maniac imitation
7276,A VISION OF POETS.,
7277,A VISION OF POETS.,In the least geste--the dropping low
7278,A VISION OF POETS.,"O' the lid, the wrinkling of the brow,"
7279,A VISION OF POETS.,"Exaggerate with mock and mow,--"
7280,A VISION OF POETS.,
7281,A VISION OF POETS.,So mastered was that company
7282,A VISION OF POETS.,"By the crowned vision utterly,"
7283,A VISION OF POETS.,Swayed to a maniac mockery.
7284,A VISION OF POETS.,
7285,A VISION OF POETS.,"One dulled his eyeballs, as they ached"
7286,A VISION OF POETS.,"With Homer's forehead, though he lacked"
7287,A VISION OF POETS.,An inch of any; and one racked
7288,A VISION OF POETS.,
7289,A VISION OF POETS.,"His lower lip with restless tooth,"
7290,A VISION OF POETS.,As Pindar's rushing words forsooth
7291,A VISION OF POETS.,Were pent behind it; one his smooth
7292,A VISION OF POETS.,
7293,A VISION OF POETS.,Pink cheeks did rumple passionate
7294,A VISION OF POETS.,"Like Æschylus, and tried to prate"
7295,A VISION OF POETS.,On trolling tongue of fate and fate;
7296,A VISION OF POETS.,
7297,A VISION OF POETS.,One set her eyes like Sappho's--or
7298,A VISION OF POETS.,Any light woman's; one forbore
7299,A VISION OF POETS.,"Like Dante, or any man as poor"
7300,A VISION OF POETS.,
7301,A VISION OF POETS.,"In mirth, to let a smile undo"
7302,A VISION OF POETS.,His hard-shut lips; and one that drew
7303,A VISION OF POETS.,"Sour humours from his mother, blew"
7304,A VISION OF POETS.,
7305,A VISION OF POETS.,His sunken cheeks out to the size
7306,A VISION OF POETS.,"Of most unnatural jollities,"
7307,A VISION OF POETS.,Because Anacreon looked jest-wise;
7308,A VISION OF POETS.,
7309,A VISION OF POETS.,So with the rest: it was a sight
7310,A VISION OF POETS.,"A great world-laughter would requite,"
7311,A VISION OF POETS.,"Or great world-wrath, with equal right"
7312,A VISION OF POETS.,
7313,A VISION OF POETS.,Out came a speaker from that crowd
7314,A VISION OF POETS.,"To speak for all, in sleek and proud"
7315,A VISION OF POETS.,"Exordial periods, while he bowed"
7316,A VISION OF POETS.,
7317,A VISION OF POETS.,"His knee before the angel--""Thus,"
7318,A VISION OF POETS.,"O angel who hast called for us,"
7319,A VISION OF POETS.,"We bring thee service emulous,"

7329,A VISION OF POETS.,"""Thou, certes, when thou askest more,"
7330,A VISION OF POETS.,"O sapient angel, leanest o'er"

7349,A VISION OF POETS.,"More yet that speaker would have said,"

7351,A VISION OF POETS.,Each separate phrase till finishèd;
7352,A VISION OF POETS.,
7353,A VISION OF POETS.,But all the foreheads of those born
7354,A VISION OF POETS.,And dead true poets flashed with scorn
7355,A VISION OF POETS.,"Betwixt the bay leaves round them worn,"
7356,A VISION OF POETS.,
7357,A VISION OF POETS.,"Ay, jetted such brave fire that they,"
7358,A VISION OF POETS.,"The new-come, shrank and paled away"

7361,A VISION OF POETS.,"Strikes on the hearth. A spirit-blast,"
7362,A VISION OF POETS.,"A presence known by power, at last"
7363,A VISION OF POETS.,Took them up mutely: they had passed.
7364,A VISION OF POETS.,
7365,A VISION OF POETS.,And he our pilgrim-poet saw
7366,A VISION OF POETS.,"Only their places, in deep awe,"

7368,A VISION OF POETS.,
7369,A VISION OF POETS.,"His gazing upward. Smiling on,"
7370,A VISION OF POETS.,"The angel in the angel shone,"

7536,A VISION OF POETS.,
7537,A VISION OF POETS.,He journeyed homeward through the wood
