95,PREFACE,
96,PREFACE,
97,PREFACE,The aim and purport of this edition of the _Poetical Works_ of Samuel
98,PREFACE,Taylor Coleridge is to provide the general reader with an authoritative
99,PREFACE,"list of the poems and dramas hitherto published, and at the same time to"
100,PREFACE,furnish the student with an exhaustive summary of various readings
101,PREFACE,"derived from published and unpublished sources, viz. (1) the successive"
102,PREFACE,"editions issued by the author, (2) holograph MSS., or (3) contemporary"
103,PREFACE,transcriptions. Occasion has been taken to include in the Text and
104,PREFACE,"Appendices a considerable number of poems, fragments, metrical"
105,PREFACE,experiments and first drafts of poems now published for the first time
106,PREFACE,"from MSS. in the British Museum, from Coleridge's Notebooks, and from"
107,PREFACE,MSS. in the possession of private collectors.
108,PREFACE,
109,PREFACE,The text of the poems and dramas follows that of the last edition of the
110,PREFACE,_Poetical Works_ published in the author's lifetime--the three-volume
111,PREFACE,edition issued by Pickering in the spring and summer of 1834.
112,PREFACE,
113,PREFACE,"I have adopted the text of 1834 in preference to that of 1829, which was"
114,PREFACE,selected by James Dykes Campbell for his monumental edition of 1893. I
115,PREFACE,should have deferred to his authority but for the existence of
116,PREFACE,"conclusive proof that, here and there, Coleridge altered and emended the"
117,PREFACE,"text of 1829, with a view to the forthcoming edition of 1834. In the"
118,PREFACE,"Preface to the 'new edition' of 1852, the editors maintain that the"
119,PREFACE,three-volume edition of 1828 (a mistake for 1829) was the last upon
120,PREFACE,"which Coleridge was 'able to bestow personal care and attention', while"
121,PREFACE,that of 1834 was 'arranged mainly if not entirely at the discretion of
122,PREFACE,"his latest editor, H. N. Coleridge'. This, no doubt, was perfectly true"
123,PREFACE,"with regard to the choice and arrangement of the poems, and the labour"
124,PREFACE,of seeing the three volumes through the press; but the fact remains that
125,PREFACE,"the text of 1829 differs from that of 1834, and that Coleridge himself,"
126,PREFACE,"and not his 'latest editor', was responsible for that difference."
127,PREFACE,
128,PREFACE,I have in my possession the proof of the first page of the 'Destiny of
129,PREFACE,"Nations' as it appeared in 1828 and 1829. Line 5 ran thus: 'The Will,"
130,PREFACE,"the Word, the Breath, the Living God.' This line is erased and line 5"
131,PREFACE,"of 1834 substituted: 'To the Will Absolute, the One, the Good' and line"
132,PREFACE,"6, 'The I AM, the Word, the Life, the Living God,' is added, and, in"
133,PREFACE,"1834, appeared for the first time. Moreover, in the 'Songs of the"
134,PREFACE,"Pixies', lines 9, 11, 12, 15, 16, as printed in 1834, differ from the"
135,PREFACE,"readings of 1829 and all previous editions. Again, in 'Christabel' lines"
136,PREFACE,"6, 7 as printed in 1834 differ from the versions of 1828, 1829, and"
137,PREFACE,revert to the original reading of the MSS. and the First Edition. It is
138,PREFACE,inconceivable that in Coleridge's lifetime and while his pen was still
139,PREFACE,"busy, his nephew should have meddled with, or remodelled, the master's"
140,PREFACE,handiwork.
141,PREFACE,
142,PREFACE,"The poems have been printed, as far as possible, in chronological order,"
143,PREFACE,"but when no MS. is extant, or when the MS. authority is a first draft"
144,PREFACE,"embodied in a notebook, the exact date can only be arrived at by a"
145,PREFACE,balance of probabilities. The present edition includes all poems and
146,PREFACE,fragments published for the first time in 1893. Many of these were
147,PREFACE,"excerpts from the Notebooks, collected, transcribed, and dated by"
148,PREFACE,"myself. Some of the fragments (_vide post_, p. 996, n. 1) I have since"
149,PREFACE,"discovered are not original compositions, but were selected passages"
150,PREFACE,"from elder poets--amongst them Cartwright's lines, entitled 'The Second"
151,PREFACE,"Birth', which are printed on p. 362 of the text; but for their insertion"
152,PREFACE,"in the edition of 1893, for a few misreadings of the MSS., and for their"
153,PREFACE,"approximate date, I was mainly responsible."
154,PREFACE,
155,PREFACE,In preparing the textual and bibliographical notes which are now printed
156,PREFACE,as footnotes to the poems I was constantly indebted for information and
157,PREFACE,suggestions to the Notes to the Poems (pp. 561-654) in the edition of
158,PREFACE,"1893. I have taken nothing for granted, but I have followed, for the"
159,PREFACE,"most part, where Dykes Campbell led, and if I differ from his"
160,PREFACE,"conclusions or have been able to supply fresh information, it is because"
161,PREFACE,fresh information based on fresh material was at my disposal.
162,PREFACE,
163,PREFACE,No apology is needed for publishing a collation of the text of
164,PREFACE,Coleridge's Poems with that of earlier editions or with the MSS. of
165,PREFACE,first drafts and alternative versions. The first to attempt anything of
166,PREFACE,"the kind was Richard Herne Shepherd, the learned and accurate editor of"
167,PREFACE,"the _Poetical Works_ in four volumes, issued by Basil Montagu Pickering"
168,PREFACE,in 1877. Important variants are recorded by Mr. Campbell in his Notes to
169,PREFACE,"the edition of 1893; and in a posthumous volume, edited by Mr. Hale"
170,PREFACE,"White in 1899 (_Coleridge's Poems_, &c.), the corrected parts of"
171,PREFACE,"'Religious Musings', the MSS. of 'Lewti', the 'Introduction to the Dark"
172,PREFACE,"Ladié', and other poems are reproduced in facsimile. Few poets have"
173,PREFACE,"altered the text of their poems so often, and so often for the better,"
174,PREFACE,"as Coleridge. He has been blamed for 'writing so little', for deserting"
175,PREFACE,poetry for metaphysics and theology; he has been upbraided for winning
176,PREFACE,"only to lose the 'prize of his high calling'. Sir Walter Scott, one of"
177,PREFACE,"his kindlier censors, rebukes him for 'the caprice and indolence with"
178,PREFACE,"which he has thrown from him, as if in mere wantonness, those unfinished"
179,PREFACE,"scraps of poetry, which like the Torso of antiquity defy the skill of"
180,PREFACE,his poetical brethren to complete them'. But whatever may be said for or
181,PREFACE,"against Coleridge as an 'inventor of harmonies', neither the fineness of"
182,PREFACE,his self-criticism nor the laborious diligence which he expended on
183,PREFACE,perfecting his inventions can be gainsaid. His erasures and emendations
184,PREFACE,"are not only a lesson in the art of poetry, not only a record of"
185,PREFACE,"poetical growth and development, but they discover and reveal the hidden"
186,PREFACE,"springs, the thoughts and passions of the artificer."
187,PREFACE,
188,PREFACE,"But if this be true of a stanza, a line, a word here or there, inserted"
189,PREFACE,"as an afterthought, is there use or sense in printing a number of"
190,PREFACE,"trifling or, apparently, accidental variants? Might not a choice have"
191,PREFACE,"been made, and the jots and tittles ignored or suppressed?"
192,PREFACE,
193,PREFACE,My plea is that it is difficult if not impossible to draw a line above
194,PREFACE,"which a variant is important and below which it is negligible; that, to"
195,PREFACE,"use a word of the poet's own coining, his emendations are rarely if ever"
196,PREFACE,'lightheartednesses'; and that if a collation of the printed text with
197,PREFACE,MSS. is worth studying at all the one must be as decipherable as the
198,PREFACE,"other. Facsimiles are rare and costly productions, and an exhaustive"
199,PREFACE,"table of variants is the nearest approach to a substitute. Many, I know,"
200,PREFACE,"are the shortcomings, too many, I fear, are the errors in the footnotes"
201,PREFACE,"to this volume, but now, for the first time, the MSS. of Coleridge's"
202,PREFACE,poems which are known to be extant are in a manner reproduced and made
203,PREFACE,available for study and research.
204,PREFACE,
205,PREFACE,Six poems of some length are now printed and included in the text of the
206,PREFACE,poems for the first time.
207,PREFACE,
208,PREFACE,"The first, 'Easter Holidays' (p. 1), is unquestionably a 'School-boy"
209,PREFACE,"Poem', and was written some months before the author had completed his"
210,PREFACE,"fifteenth year. It tends to throw doubt on the alleged date of 'Time,"
211,PREFACE,Real and Imaginary'.
212,PREFACE,
213,PREFACE,"The second,'An Inscription for a Seat,' &c. (p. 349), was first"
214,PREFACE,"published in the _Morning Post_, on October 21, 1800, Coleridge's"
215,PREFACE,twenty-eighth birthday. It remains an open question whether it was
216,PREFACE,written by Coleridge or by Wordsworth. Both were contributors to the
217,PREFACE,_Morning Post_. Both wrote 'Inscriptions'. Both had a hand in making the
218,PREFACE,"'seat'. Neither claimed or republished the poem. It favours or, rather,"
219,PREFACE,parodies the style and sentiments now of one and now of the other.
220,PREFACE,
221,PREFACE,"The third, 'The Rash Conjurer' (p. 399), must have been read by H. N."
222,PREFACE,"Coleridge, who included the last seven lines, the 'Epilogue', in the"
223,PREFACE,"first volume of _Literary Remains_, published in 1836. I presume that,"
224,PREFACE,"even as a fantasia, the subject was regarded as too extravagant, and, it"
225,PREFACE,"may be, too coarsely worded for publication. It was no doubt in the"
226,PREFACE,"first instance a 'metrical experiment', but it is to be interpreted"
227,PREFACE,"allegorically. The 'Rash Conjurer', the _âme damnée_, is the adept in"
228,PREFACE,the black magic of metaphysics. But for that he might have been like his
229,PREFACE,"brothers, a 'Devonshire Christian'."
230,PREFACE,
231,PREFACE,"The fourth, 'The Madman and the Lethargist' (p. 414), is an expansion of"
232,PREFACE,an epigram in the Greek Anthology. It is possible that it was written in
233,PREFACE,"Germany in 1799, and is contemporary with the epigrams published in the"
234,PREFACE,"_Morning Post_ in 1802, for the Greek original is quoted by Lessing in a"
235,PREFACE,critical excursus on the nature of an epigram.
236,PREFACE,
237,PREFACE,"The fifth, 'Faith, Hope, and Charity' (p. 427), was translated from the"
238,PREFACE,"Italian of Guarini at Calne, in 1815."
239,PREFACE,
240,PREFACE,"Of the sixth, 'The Delinquent Travellers' (p. 443), I know nothing save"
241,PREFACE,"that the MS., a first copy, is in Coleridge's handwriting. It was"
242,PREFACE,probably written for and may have been published in a newspaper or
243,PREFACE,periodical. It was certainly written at Highgate.
244,PREFACE,
245,PREFACE,Of the epigrams and _jeux d'esprit_ eight are now published for the
246,PREFACE,"first time, and of the fragments from various sources twenty-seven have"
247,PREFACE,been added to those published in 1893.
248,PREFACE,
249,PREFACE,Of the first drafts and alternative versions of well-known poems
250,PREFACE,thirteen are now printed for the first time. Two versions of 'The Eolian
251,PREFACE,"Harp', preserved in the Library of Rugby School, and the dramatic"
252,PREFACE,"fragment entitled 'The Triumph of Loyalty', are of especial interest and"
253,PREFACE,importance.
254,PREFACE,
255,PREFACE,An exact reproduction of the text of the 'Ancyent Marinere' as printed
256,PREFACE,in an early copy of the _Lyrical Ballads_ of 1798 which belonged to S.
257,PREFACE,"T. Coleridge, and a collation of the text of the 'Introduction to the"
258,PREFACE,"Tale of the Dark Ladié', as published in the _Morning Post_, Dec. 21,"
259,PREFACE,"1799, with two MSS. preserved in the British Museum, are included in"
260,PREFACE,Appendix No. I.
261,PREFACE,
262,PREFACE,The text of the 'Allegoric Vision' has been collated with the original
263,PREFACE,MS. and with the texts of 1817 and 1829.
264,PREFACE,
265,PREFACE,A section has been devoted to 'Metrical Experiments'; eleven out of
266,PREFACE,thirteen are now published for the first time. A few critical notes by
267,PREFACE,"Professor Saintsbury are, with his kind permission, appended to the"
268,PREFACE,text.
269,PREFACE,
270,PREFACE,Numerous poems and fragments of poems first saw the light in 1893; and
271,PREFACE,"now again, in 1912, a second batch of newly-discovered, forgotten, or"
272,PREFACE,purposely omitted MSS. has been collected for publication. It may
273,PREFACE,"reasonably be asked if the tale is told, or if any MSS. have been"
274,PREFACE,retained for publication at a future date. I cannot answer for fresh
275,PREFACE,"discoveries of poems already published in newspapers and periodicals, or"
276,PREFACE,"of MSS. in private collections, but I can vouch for a final issue of all"
277,PREFACE,poems and fragments of poems included in the collection of Notebooks and
278,PREFACE,unassorted MSS. which belonged to Coleridge at his death and were
279,PREFACE,"bequeathed by him to his literary executor, Joseph Henry Green. Nothing"
280,PREFACE,remains which if published in days to come could leave the present issue
281,PREFACE,incomplete.
282,PREFACE,
283,PREFACE,A bibliography of the successive editions of poems and dramas published
284,PREFACE,by Coleridge himself and of the principal collected and selected
285,PREFACE,editions which have been published since 1834 follows the Appendices to
286,PREFACE,"this volume. The actual record is long and intricate, but the history of"
287,PREFACE,the gradual accretions may be summed up in a few sentences. 'The Fall of
288,PREFACE,"Robespierre' was published in 1795. A first edition, entitled 'Poems on"
289,PREFACE,"Various Subjects', was published in 1796. Second and third editions,"
290,PREFACE,"with additions and subtractions, followed in 1797 and 1803. Two poems,"
291,PREFACE,"'The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere' and 'The Nightingale, a Conversation"
292,PREFACE,"Poem', and two extracts from an unpublished drama ('Osorio') were"
293,PREFACE,included in the _Lyrical Ballads_ of 1798. A quarto pamphlet containing
294,PREFACE,"three poems, 'Fears in Solitude,' 'France: An Ode,' 'Frost at Midnight,'"
295,PREFACE,was issued in the same year. 'Love' was first published in the second
296,PREFACE,"edition of the _Lyrical Ballads_, 1800. 'The Three Graves,' 'A Hymn"
297,PREFACE,"before Sunrise, &c.,' and 'Idoloclastes Satyrane', were included in the"
298,PREFACE,"_Friend_ (Sept.-Nov., 1809). 'Christabel,' 'Kubla Khan,' and 'The Pains"
299,PREFACE,"of Sleep' were published by themselves in 1816. _Sibylline Leaves_,"
300,PREFACE,"which appeared in 1817 and was described as 'A Collection of Poems',"
301,PREFACE,"included the contents of the editions of 1797 and 1803, the poems"
302,PREFACE,"published in the _Lyrical Ballads_ of 1798, 1800, and the quarto"
303,PREFACE,"pamphlet of 1798, but excluded the contents of the first edition (except"
304,PREFACE,"the 'Eolian Harp'), 'Christabel', 'Kubla Khan', and 'The Pains of"
305,PREFACE,Sleep'. The first collected edition of the _Poetical Works_ (which
306,PREFACE,"included a selection of the poems published in the three first editions,"
307,PREFACE,"a reissue of _Sibylline Leaves_, the 'Wanderings of Cain', a few poems"
308,PREFACE,"recently contributed to periodicals, and the following dramas--the"
309,PREFACE,"translation of Schiller's 'Piccolomini', published in 1800, 'Remorse'--a"
310,PREFACE,"revised version of 'Osorio'--published in 1813, and 'Zapolya', published"
311,PREFACE,in 1817) was issued in three volumes in 1828. A second collected edition
312,PREFACE,"in three volumes, a reissue of 1828, with an amended text and the"
313,PREFACE,"addition of 'The Improvisatore' and 'The Garden of Boccaccio', followed"
314,PREFACE,in 1829.
315,PREFACE,
316,PREFACE,"Finally, in 1834, there was a reissue in three volumes of the contents"
317,PREFACE,of 1829 with numerous additional poems then published or collected for
318,PREFACE,the first time. The first volume contained twenty-six juvenilia printed
319,PREFACE,from letters and MS. copybooks which had been preserved by the poet's
320,PREFACE,"family, and the second volume some forty 'Miscellaneous Poems',"
321,PREFACE,extracted from the Notebooks or reprinted from newspapers. The most
322,PREFACE,"important additions were 'Alice du Clos', then first published from MS.,"
323,PREFACE,"'The Knight's Tomb' and the 'Epitaph'. 'Love, Hope, and Patience in"
324,PREFACE,"Education', which had appeared in the _Keepsake_ of 1830, was printed on"
325,PREFACE,the last page of the third volume.
326,PREFACE,
327,PREFACE,After Coleridge's death the first attempt to gather up the fragments of
328,PREFACE,his poetry was made by his 'latest editor' H. N. Coleridge in 1836. The
329,PREFACE,first volume of _Literary Remains_ contains the first reprint of 'The
330,PREFACE,"Fall of Robespierre', some thirty-six poems collected from the"
331,PREFACE,"_Watchman_, the _Morning Post_, &c., and a selection of fragments then"
332,PREFACE,"first printed from a MS. Notebook, now known as 'the Gutch Memorandum"
333,PREFACE,Book'.
334,PREFACE,
335,PREFACE,"H. N. Coleridge died in 1843, and in 1844 his widow prepared a"
336,PREFACE,"one-volume edition of the Poems, which was published by Pickering."
337,PREFACE,Eleven juvenilia which had first appeared in 1834 were omitted and the
338,PREFACE,poems first collected in _Literary Remains_ were for the first time
339,PREFACE,included in the text. In 1850 Mrs. H. N. Coleridge included in the third
340,PREFACE,volume of the _Essays on His Own Times_ six poems and numerous epigrams
341,PREFACE,and _jeux d'esprit_ which had appeared in the _Morning Post_ and
342,PREFACE,_Courier_. This was the first reprint of the Epigrams as a whole. A 'new
343,PREFACE,edition' of the Poems which she had prepared in the last year of her
344,PREFACE,"life was published immediately after her death (May, 1852) by Edward"
345,PREFACE,"Moxon. It was based on the one-volume edition of 1844, with unimportant"
346,PREFACE,"omissions and additions; only one poem, 'The Hymn', was published for"
347,PREFACE,the first time from MS.
348,PREFACE,
349,PREFACE,In the same year (1852) the Dramatic Works (not including 'The Fall of
350,PREFACE,"Robespierre'), edited by Derwent Coleridge, were published in a separate"
351,PREFACE,volume.
352,PREFACE,
353,PREFACE,In 1863 and 1870 the 'new edition' of 1852 was reissued by Derwent
354,PREFACE,Coleridge with an appendix containing thirteen poems collected for the
355,PREFACE,first time in 1863. The reissue of 1870 contained a reprint of the first
356,PREFACE,edition of the 'Ancient Mariner'.
357,PREFACE,
358,PREFACE,"The first edition of the _Poetical Works_, based on all previous"
359,PREFACE,"editions, and including the contents of _Literary Remains_ (vol. i) and"
360,PREFACE,"of _Essays on His Own Times_ (vol. iii), was issued by Basil Montagu"
361,PREFACE,Pickering in four volumes in 1877. Many poems (including 'Remorse') were
362,PREFACE,collated for the first time with the text of previous editions and
363,PREFACE,"newspaper versions by the editor, Richard Herne Shepherd. The four"
364,PREFACE,volumes (with a Supplement to vol. ii) were reissued by Messrs.
365,PREFACE,Macmillan in 1880.
366,PREFACE,
367,PREFACE,"Finally, in the one-volume edition of the _Poetical Works_ issued by"
368,PREFACE,"Messrs. Macmillan in 1893, J. D. Campbell included in the text some"
369,PREFACE,twenty poems and in the Appendix a large number of poetical fragments
370,PREFACE,and first drafts then printed for the first time from MS.

3131,HAPPINESS[30:1],
3132,HAPPINESS[30:1],On wide or narrow scale shall Man
3133,HAPPINESS[30:1],Most happily describe Life's plan?
3134,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Say shall he bloom and wither there,"
3135,HAPPINESS[30:1],Where first his infant buds appear;
3136,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Or upwards dart with soaring force,                                  5"
3137,HAPPINESS[30:1],And tempt some more ambitious course?
3138,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Obedient now to Hope's command,"
3139,HAPPINESS[30:1],"I bid each humble wish expand,"
3140,HAPPINESS[30:1],And fair and bright Life's prospects seem.
3141,HAPPINESS[30:1],"While Hope displays her cheering beam,                              10"
3142,HAPPINESS[30:1],"And Fancy's vivid colourings stream,"
3143,HAPPINESS[30:1],While Emulation stands me nigh
3144,HAPPINESS[30:1],The Goddess of the eager eye.
3145,HAPPINESS[30:1],With foot advanc'd and anxious heart
3146,HAPPINESS[30:1],Now for the fancied goal I start:--                                 15
3147,HAPPINESS[30:1],Ah! why will Reason intervene
3148,HAPPINESS[30:1],Me and my promis'd joys between!
3149,HAPPINESS[30:1],"She stops my course, she chains my speed,"
3150,HAPPINESS[30:1],While thus her forceful words proceed:--
3151,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Ah! listen, Youth, ere yet too late,                                20"
3152,HAPPINESS[30:1],What evils on thy course may wait!
3153,HAPPINESS[30:1],"To bow the head, to bend the knee,"
3154,HAPPINESS[30:1],"A minion of Servility,"
3155,HAPPINESS[30:1],"At low Pride's frequent frowns to sigh,"
3156,HAPPINESS[30:1],And watch the glance in Folly's eye;                                25
3157,HAPPINESS[30:1],"To toil intense, yet toil in vain,"
3158,HAPPINESS[30:1],And feel with what a hollow pain
3159,HAPPINESS[30:1],Pale Disappointment hangs her head
3160,HAPPINESS[30:1],O'er darling Expectation dead!
3161,HAPPINESS[30:1],'The scene is changed and Fortune's gale                          30
3162,HAPPINESS[30:1],Shall belly out each prosperous sail.
3163,HAPPINESS[30:1],Yet sudden wealth full well I know
3164,HAPPINESS[30:1],Did never happiness bestow.
3165,HAPPINESS[30:1],That wealth to which we were not born
3166,HAPPINESS[30:1],Dooms us to sorrow or to scorn.                                     35
3167,HAPPINESS[30:1],Behold yon flock which long had trod
3168,HAPPINESS[30:1],"O'er the short grass of Devon's sod,"
3169,HAPPINESS[30:1],"To Lincoln's rank rich meads transferr'd,"
3170,HAPPINESS[30:1],And in their fate thy own be fear'd;
3171,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Through every limb contagions fly,                                  40"
3172,HAPPINESS[30:1],Deform'd and choked they burst and die.
3173,HAPPINESS[30:1],"'When Luxury opens wide her arms,"
3174,HAPPINESS[30:1],"And smiling wooes thee to those charms,"
3175,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Whose fascination thousands own,"
3176,HAPPINESS[30:1],Shall thy brows wear the stoic frown?                               45
3177,HAPPINESS[30:1],And when her goblet she extends
3178,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Which maddening myriads press around,"
3179,HAPPINESS[30:1],What power divine thy soul befriends
3180,HAPPINESS[30:1],That thou should'st dash it to the ground?--
3181,HAPPINESS[30:1],"No, thou shalt drink, and thou shalt know                           50"
3182,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Her transient bliss, her lasting woe,"
3183,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Her maniac joys, that know no measure,"
3184,HAPPINESS[30:1],And Riot rude and painted Pleasure;--
3185,HAPPINESS[30:1],Till (sad reverse!) the Enchantress vile
3186,HAPPINESS[30:1],To frowns converts her magic smile;                                 55
3187,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Her train impatient to destroy,"
3188,HAPPINESS[30:1],Observe her frown with gloomy joy;
3189,HAPPINESS[30:1],On thee with harpy fangs they seize
3190,HAPPINESS[30:1],"The hideous offspring of Disease,"
3191,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Swoln Dropsy ignorant of Rest,                                      60"
3192,HAPPINESS[30:1],"And Fever garb'd in scarlet vest,"
3193,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Consumption driving the quick hearse,"
3194,HAPPINESS[30:1],"And Gout that howls the frequent curse,"
3195,HAPPINESS[30:1],With Apoplex of heavy head
3196,HAPPINESS[30:1],That surely aims his dart of lead.                                  65
3197,HAPPINESS[30:1],'But say Life's joys unmix'd were given
3198,HAPPINESS[30:1],To thee some favourite of Heaven:
3199,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Within, without, tho' all were health--"
3200,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Yet what e'en thus are Fame, Power, Wealth,"
3201,HAPPINESS[30:1],"But sounds that variously express,                                  70"

3207,HAPPINESS[30:1],"As oft when Night o'er Heaven is spread,"
3208,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Round this maternal seat you tread,"
3209,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Where far from splendour, far from riot,"
3210,HAPPINESS[30:1],In silence wrapt sleeps careless Quiet.

3212,HAPPINESS[30:1],And thine the peaceful evening walk;
3213,HAPPINESS[30:1],And what to thee the sweetest are--
3214,HAPPINESS[30:1],"The setting sun, the Evening Star--"
3215,HAPPINESS[30:1],"The tints, which live along the sky,"
3216,HAPPINESS[30:1],"And Moon that meets thy raptur'd eye,                               85"
3217,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Where oft the tear shall grateful start,"
3218,HAPPINESS[30:1],Dear silent pleasures of the Heart!
3219,HAPPINESS[30:1],"Ah! Being blest, for Heaven shall lend"

3227,HAPPINESS[30:1],For humble independence pray

9944,A VISION,"That first unsensualises the dark mind,"
9945,A VISION,Giving it new delights; and bids it swell
9946,A VISION,"With wild activity; and peopling air,"
9947,A VISION,"By obscure fears of Beings invisible,"
9948,A VISION,Emancipates it from the grosser thrall                              85
9949,A VISION,"Of the present impulse, teaching Self-control,"

9963,A VISION,Pierces the untravelled realms of Ocean's bed

9965,A VISION,"By mis-shaped prodigies beleaguered, such"
9966,A VISION,"As Earth ne'er bred, nor Air, nor the upper Sea:"
9967,A VISION,"Where dwells the Fury Form, whose unheard name"
9968,A VISION,"With eager eye, pale cheek, suspended breath,"
9969,A VISION,"And lips half-opening with the dread of sound,                     105"

9975,A VISION,Forces to unchain the foodful progeny
9976,A VISION,"Of the Ocean stream;--thence thro' the realm of Souls,"
9977,A VISION,"Where live the Innocent, as far from cares"
9978,A VISION,As from the storms and overwhelming waves
9979,A VISION,"That tumble on the surface of the Deep,                            115"
9980,A VISION,"Returns with far-heard pant, hotly pursued"
9981,A VISION,"By the fierce Warders of the Sea, once more,"
9982,A VISION,"Ere by the frost foreclosed, to repossess"
9983,A VISION,"His fleshly mansion, that had staid the while"

9985,A VISION,"Untenanted.--Wild phantasies! yet wise,"
9986,A VISION,On the victorious goodness of high God
9987,A VISION,"Teaching reliance, and medicinal hope,"
9988,A VISION,"Till from Bethabra northward, heavenly Truth"
9989,A VISION,"With gradual steps, winning her difficult way,                     125"

9991,A VISION,
9992,A VISION,"If there be Beings of higher class than Man,"
9993,A VISION,"I deem no nobler province they possess,"
9994,A VISION,Than by disposal of apt circumstance
9995,A VISION,"To rear up kingdoms: and the deeds they prompt,                    130"
9996,A VISION,"Distinguishing from mortal agency,"
9997,A VISION,They choose their human ministers from such states
9998,A VISION,"As still the Epic song half fears to name,"
9999,A VISION,Repelled from all the minstrelsies that strike
10000,A VISION,The palace-roof and soothe the monarch's pride.                    135
10001,A VISION,"And such, perhaps, the Spirit, who (if words"
10002,A VISION,Witnessed by answering deeds may claim our faith)
10003,A VISION,Held commune with that warrior-maid of France
10004,A VISION,"Who scourged the Invader. From her infant days,"
10005,A VISION,"With Wisdom, mother of retired thoughts,                           140"
10006,A VISION,Her soul had dwelt; and she was quick to mark
10007,A VISION,"The good and evil thing, in human lore"
10008,A VISION,"Undisciplined. For lowly was her birth,"
10009,A VISION,And Heaven had doomed her early years to toil
10010,A VISION,"That pure from Tyranny's least deed, herself                       145"
10011,A VISION,"Unfeared by Fellow-natures, she might wait"
10012,A VISION,"On the poor labouring man with kindly looks,"
10013,A VISION,And minister refreshment to the tired
10014,A VISION,"Way-wanderer, when along the rough-hewn bench"
10015,A VISION,"The sweltry man had stretched him, and aloft                       150"
10016,A VISION,Vacantly watched the rudely-pictured board
10017,A VISION,Which on the Mulberry-bough with welcome creak
10018,A VISION,"Swung to the pleasant breeze. Here, too, the Maid"
10019,A VISION,"Learnt more than Schools could teach: Man's shifting mind,"
10020,A VISION,His vices and his sorrows! And full oft                            155
10021,A VISION,At tales of cruel wrong and strange distress
10022,A VISION,Had wept and shivered. To the tottering Eld
10023,A VISION,Still as a daughter would she run: she placed
10024,A VISION,"His cold limbs at the sunny door, and loved"
10025,A VISION,"To hear him story, in his garrulous sort,                          160"
10026,A VISION,"Of his eventful years, all come and gone."
10027,A VISION,
10028,A VISION,"So twenty seasons past. The Virgin's form,"
10029,A VISION,"Active and tall, nor Sloth nor Luxury"
10030,A VISION,"Had shrunk or paled. Her front sublime and broad,"
10031,A VISION,"Her flexile eye-brows wildly haired and low,                       165"
10032,A VISION,"And her full eye, now bright, now unillumed,"
10033,A VISION,Spake more than Woman's thought; and all her face
10034,A VISION,Was moulded to such features as declared
10035,A VISION,"That Pity there had oft and strongly worked,"
10036,A VISION,"And sometimes Indignation. Bold her mien,                          170"
10037,A VISION,And like an haughty huntress of the woods
10038,A VISION,She moved: yet sure she was a gentle maid!
10039,A VISION,And in each motion her most innocent soul
10040,A VISION,"Beamed forth so brightly, that who saw would say"
10041,A VISION,Guilt was a thing impossible in her!                               175
10042,A VISION,Nor idly would have said--for she had lived
10043,A VISION,"In this bad World, as in a place of Tombs,"
10044,A VISION,And touched not the pollutions of the Dead.
10045,A VISION,
10046,A VISION,'Twas the cold season when the Rustic's eye
10047,A VISION,From the drear desolate whiteness of his fields                    180
10048,A VISION,Rolls for relief to watch the skiey tints
10049,A VISION,And clouds slow-varying their huge imagery;
10050,A VISION,"When now, as she was wont, the healthful Maid"
10051,A VISION,Had left her pallet ere one beam of day
10052,A VISION,Slanted the fog-smoke. She went forth alone                        185
10053,A VISION,"Urged by the indwelling angel-guide, that oft,"
10054,A VISION,With dim inexplicable sympathies
10055,A VISION,"Disquieting the heart, shapes out Man's course"
10056,A VISION,To the predoomed adventure. Now the ascent
10057,A VISION,"She climbs of that steep upland, on whose top                      190"
10058,A VISION,"The Pilgrim-man, who long since eve had watched"
10059,A VISION,"The alien shine of unconcerning stars,"
10060,A VISION,"Shouts to himself, there first the Abbey-lights"
10061,A VISION,Seen in Neufchâtel's vale; now slopes adown
10062,A VISION,"The winding sheep-track vale-ward: when, behold                    195"
10063,A VISION,In the first entrance of the level road
10064,A VISION,An unattended team! The foremost horse
10065,A VISION,"Lay with stretched limbs; the others, yet alive"
10066,A VISION,"But stiff and cold, stood motionless, their manes"
10067,A VISION,Hoar with the frozen night-dews. Dismally                          200
10068,A VISION,The dark-red dawn now glimmered; but its gleams
10069,A VISION,"Disclosed no face of man. The maiden paused,"
10070,A VISION,Then hailed who might be near. No voice replied.
10071,A VISION,From the thwart wain at length there reached her ear
10072,A VISION,A sound so feeble that it almost seemed                            205
10073,A VISION,"Distant: and feebly, with slow effort pushed,"
10074,A VISION,A miserable man crept forth: his limbs
10075,A VISION,"The silent frost had eat, scathing like fire."
10076,A VISION,"Faint on the shafts he rested. She, meantime,"
10077,A VISION,Saw crowded close beneath the coverture                            210
10078,A VISION,"A mother and her children--lifeless all,"
10079,A VISION,Yet lovely! not a lineament was marred--
10080,A VISION,Death had put on so slumber-like a form!
10081,A VISION,"It was a piteous sight; and one, a babe."
10082,A VISION,"The crisp milk frozen on its innocent lips,                        215"
10083,A VISION,"Lay on the woman's arm, its little hand"
10084,A VISION,Stretched on her bosom.
10085,A VISION,
10086,A VISION,"Mutely questioning,"
10087,A VISION,The Maid gazed wildly at the living wretch.
10088,A VISION,"He, his head feebly turning, on the group"
10089,A VISION,"Looked with a vacant stare, and his eye spoke                      220"
10090,A VISION,The drowsy calm that steals on worn-out anguish.
10091,A VISION,"She shuddered; but, each vainer pang subdued,"
10092,A VISION,Quick disentangling from the foremost horse
10093,A VISION,"The rustic bands, with difficulty and toil"
10094,A VISION,"The stiff cramped team forced homeward. There arrived,             225"
10095,A VISION,"Anxiously tends him she with healing herbs,"
10096,A VISION,And weeps and prays--but the numb power of Death
10097,A VISION,"Spreads o'er his limbs; and ere the noon-tide hour,"
10098,A VISION,The hovering spirits of his Wife and Babes
10099,A VISION,"Hail him immortal! Yet amid his pangs,                             230"
10100,A VISION,"With interruptions long from ghastly throes,"
10101,A VISION,His voice had faltered out this simple tale.
10102,A VISION,
10103,A VISION,"The Village, where he dwelt an husbandman,"
10104,A VISION,By sudden inroad had been seized and fired
10105,A VISION,Late on the yester-evening. With his wife                          235
10106,A VISION,And little ones he hurried his escape.
10107,A VISION,"They saw the neighbouring hamlets flame, they heard"
10108,A VISION,Uproar and shrieks! and terror-struck drove on
10109,A VISION,"Through unfrequented roads, a weary way!"
10110,A VISION,But saw nor house nor cottage. All had quenched                    240
10111,A VISION,Their evening hearth-fire: for the alarm had spread.
10112,A VISION,"The air clipt keen, the night was fanged with frost,"
10113,A VISION,And they provisionless! The weeping wife
10114,A VISION,"Ill hushed her children's moans; and still they moaned,"
10115,A VISION,Till Fright and Cold and Hunger drank their life.                  245
10116,A VISION,"They closed their eyes in sleep, nor knew 'twas Death."
10117,A VISION,"He only, lashing his o'er-wearied team,"
10118,A VISION,"Gained a sad respite, till beside the base"
10119,A VISION,Of the high hill his foremost horse dropped dead.
10120,A VISION,"Then hopeless, strengthless, sick for lack of food,                250"
10121,A VISION,"He crept beneath the coverture, entranced,"
10122,A VISION,Till wakened by the maiden.--Such his tale.
10123,A VISION,
10124,A VISION,"Ah! suffering to the height of what was suffered,"
10125,A VISION,"Stung with too keen a sympathy, the Maid"
10126,A VISION,"Brooded with moving lips, mute, startful, dark!                    255"
10127,A VISION,And now her flushed tumultuous features shot
10128,A VISION,"Such strange vivacity, as fires the eye"
10129,A VISION,Of Misery fancy-crazed! and now once more
10130,A VISION,"Naked, and void, and fixed, and all within"
10131,A VISION,The unquiet silence of confuséd thought                            260
10132,A VISION,And shapeless feelings. For a mighty hand
10133,A VISION,"Was strong upon her, till in the heat of soul"
10134,A VISION,"To the high hill-top tracing back her steps,"
10135,A VISION,"Aside the beacon, up whose smouldered stones"
10136,A VISION,"The tender ivy-trails crept thinly, there,                         265"
10137,A VISION,"Unconscious of the driving element,"
10138,A VISION,"Yea, swallowed up in the ominous dream, she sate"
10139,A VISION,Ghastly as broad-eyed Slumber! a dim anguish
10140,A VISION,"Breathed from her look! and still with pant and sob,"
10141,A VISION,"Inly she toiled to flee, and still subdued,                        270"
10142,A VISION,Felt an inevitable Presence near.
10143,A VISION,
10144,A VISION,"Thus as she toiled in troublous ecstasy,"
10145,A VISION,"A horror of great darkness wrapt her round,"
10146,A VISION,"And a voice uttered forth unearthly tones,"
10147,A VISION,"Calming her soul,--'O Thou of the Most High                        275"
10148,A VISION,"Chosen, whom all the perfected in Heaven"
10149,A VISION,Behold expectant--'

10151,A VISION,[The following fragments were intended to form part of the poem when
10152,A VISION,finished.]
10153,A VISION,
10154,A VISION,[140:1]'Maid beloved of Heaven!
10155,A VISION,(To her the tutelary Power exclaimed)
10156,A VISION,Of Chaos the adventurous progeny                                   280
10157,A VISION,Thou seest; foul missionaries of foul sire.
10158,A VISION,Fierce to regain the losses of that hour
10159,A VISION,"When Love rose glittering, and his gorgeous wings"
10160,A VISION,"Over the abyss fluttered with such glad noise,"
10161,A VISION,"As what time after long and pestful calms,                         285"
10162,A VISION,With slimy shapes and miscreated life
10163,A VISION,"Poisoning the vast Pacific, the fresh breeze"
10164,A VISION,Wakens the merchant-sail uprising. Night
10165,A VISION,An heavy unimaginable moan
10166,A VISION,"Sent forth, when she the Protoplast beheld                         290"
10167,A VISION,Stand beauteous on Confusion's charméd wave.
10168,A VISION,"Moaning she fled, and entered the Profound"
10169,A VISION,That leads with downward windings to the Cave
10170,A VISION,"Of Darkness palpable, Desert of Death"
10171,A VISION,Sunk deep beneath Gehenna's massy roots.                           295
10172,A VISION,There many a dateless age the Beldame lurked
10173,A VISION,"And trembled; till engendered by fierce Hate,"
10174,A VISION,"Fierce Hate and gloomy Hope, a Dream arose,"
10175,A VISION,Shaped like a black cloud marked with streaks of fire.
10176,A VISION,It roused the Hell-Hag: she the dew-damp wiped                     300
10177,A VISION,"From off her brow, and through the uncouth maze"
10178,A VISION,Retraced her steps; but ere she reached the mouth
10179,A VISION,"Of that drear labyrinth, shuddering she paused,"
10180,A VISION,Nor dared re-enter the diminished Gulph.
10181,A VISION,As through the dark vaults of some mouldered Tower                 305
10182,A VISION,"(Which, fearful to approach, the evening hind"
10183,A VISION,Circles at distance in his homeward way)
10184,A VISION,"The winds breathe hollow, deemed the plaining groan"
10185,A VISION,Of prisoned spirits; with such fearful voice
10186,A VISION,"Night murmured, and the sound through Chaos went.                  310"
10187,A VISION,Leaped at her call her hideous-fronted brood!
10188,A VISION,"A dark behest they heard, and rushed on earth;"
10189,A VISION,"Since that sad hour, in Camps and Courts adored,"
10190,A VISION,"Rebels from God, and Tyrants o'er Mankind!'"
10191,A VISION,
10192,A VISION,*       *       *       *       *
10193,A VISION,
10194,A VISION,From his obscure haunt                                 315
10195,A VISION,"Shrieked Fear, of Cruelty the ghastly Dam,"
10196,A VISION,"Feverous yet freezing, eager-paced yet slow,"
10197,A VISION,As she that creeps from forth her swampy reeds.
10198,A VISION,"Ague, the biform Hag! when early Spring"
10199,A VISION,Beams on the marsh-bred vapours.                                   320
10200,A VISION,
10201,A VISION,'Even so (the exulting Maiden said)
10202,A VISION,"The sainted Heralds of Good Tidings fell,"
10203,A VISION,And thus they witnessed God! But now the clouds
10204,A VISION,"Treading, and storms beneath their feet, they soar"
10205,A VISION,"Higher, and higher soar, and soaring sing                          325"
10206,A VISION,"Loud songs of triumph! O ye Spirits of God,"
10207,A VISION,Hover around my mortal agonies!'
10208,A VISION,"She spake, and instantly faint melody"
10209,A VISION,"Melts on her ear, soothing and sad, and slow,"
10210,A VISION,"Such measures, as at calmest midnight heard                        330"
10211,A VISION,"By agéd Hermit in his holy dream,"
10212,A VISION,Foretell and solace death; and now they rise
10213,A VISION,"Louder, as when with harp and mingled voice"
10214,A VISION,The white-robed multitude of slaughtered saints
10215,A VISION,At Heaven's wide-open'd portals gratulant                          335
10216,A VISION,Receive some martyred patriot. The harmony[142:1]
10217,A VISION,"Entranced the Maid, till each suspended sense"
10218,A VISION,"Brief slumber seized, and confused ecstasy."
10219,A VISION,
10220,A VISION,"At length awakening slow, she gazed around:"
10221,A VISION,"And through a mist, the relict of that trance                      340"
10222,A VISION,"Still thinning as she gazed, an Isle appeared,"
10223,A VISION,"Its high, o'er-hanging, white, broad-breasted cliffs,"
10224,A VISION,Glassed on the subject ocean. A vast plain
10225,A VISION,"Stretched opposite, where ever and anon"
10226,A VISION,The plough-man following sad his meagre team                       345
10227,A VISION,"Turned up fresh sculls unstartled, and the bones"
10228,A VISION,"Of fierce hate-breathing combatants, who there"
10229,A VISION,"All mingled lay beneath the common earth,"
10230,A VISION,Death's gloomy reconcilement! O'er the fields
10231,A VISION,"Stept a fair Form, repairing all she might,                        350"
10232,A VISION,"Her temples olive-wreathed; and where she trod,"
10233,A VISION,"Fresh flowerets rose, and many a foodful herb."
10234,A VISION,"But wan her cheek, her footsteps insecure,"
10235,A VISION,"And anxious pleasure beamed in her faint eye,"
10236,A VISION,"As she had newly left a couch of pain,                             355"
10237,A VISION,Pale Convalescent! (Yet some time to rule
10238,A VISION,"With power exclusive o'er the willing world,"
10239,A VISION,That blessed prophetic mandate then fulfilled--
10240,A VISION,"Peace be on Earth!) An happy while, but brief,"
10241,A VISION,"She seemed to wander with assiduous feet,                          360"
10242,A VISION,"And healed the recent harm of chill and blight,"
10243,A VISION,And nursed each plant that fair and virtuous grew.
10244,A VISION,
10245,A VISION,But soon a deep precursive sound moaned hollow:
10246,A VISION,"Black rose the clouds, and now, (as in a dream)"
10247,A VISION,"Their reddening shapes, transformed to Warrior-hosts,              365"
10248,A VISION,"Coursed o'er the sky, and battled in mid-air."
10249,A VISION,Nor did not the large blood-drops fall from Heaven
10250,A VISION,"Portentous! while aloft were seen to float,"
10251,A VISION,"Like hideous features looming on the mist,"
10252,A VISION,"Wan stains of ominous light! Resigned, yet sad,                    370"
10253,A VISION,"The fair Form bowed her olive-crownéd brow,"
10254,A VISION,Then o'er the plain with oft-reverted eye
10255,A VISION,"Fled till a place of Tombs she reached, and there"
10256,A VISION,Within a ruined Sepulchre obscure
10257,A VISION,Found hiding-place.
10258,A VISION,
10259,A VISION,The delegated Maid                             375
10260,A VISION,"Gazed through her tears, then in sad tones exclaimed;--"
10261,A VISION,"Thou mild-eyed Form! wherefore, ah! wherefore fled?"
10262,A VISION,"The Power of Justice like a name all light,"
10263,A VISION,"Shone from thy brow; but all they, who unblamed"
10264,A VISION,"Dwelt in thy dwellings, call thee Happiness.                       380"
10265,A VISION,"Ah! why, uninjured and unprofited,"
10266,A VISION,Should multitudes against their brethren rush?
10267,A VISION,"Why sow they guilt, still reaping misery?"
10268,A VISION,"Lenient of care, thy songs, O Peace! are sweet,[144:1]"
10269,A VISION,"As after showers the perfumed gale of eve,                         385"
10270,A VISION,That flings the cool drops on a feverous cheek;
10271,A VISION,And gay thy grassy altar piled with fruits.
10272,A VISION,"But boasts the shrine of Dæmon War one charm,[144:2]"
10273,A VISION,"Save that with many an orgie strange and foul,[144:3]"
10274,A VISION,"Dancing around with interwoven arms,                               390"
10275,A VISION,The Maniac Suicide and Giant Murder
10276,A VISION,"Exult in their fierce union! I am sad,"
10277,A VISION,And know not why the simple peasants crowd
10278,A VISION,Beneath the Chieftains' standard!' Thus the Maid.
10279,A VISION,
10280,A VISION,To her the tutelary Spirit said:                                 395
10281,A VISION,'When Luxury and Lust's exhausted stores
10282,A VISION,No more can rouse the appetites of kings;
10283,A VISION,When the low flattery of their reptile lords
10284,A VISION,Falls flat and heavy on the accustomed ear;
10285,A VISION,"When eunuchs sing, and fools buffoonery make,                      400"
10286,A VISION,And dancers writhe their harlot-limbs in vain;
10287,A VISION,Then War and all its dread vicissitudes
10288,A VISION,Pleasingly agitate their stagnant hearts;
10289,A VISION,"Its hopes, its fears, its victories, its defeats,"
10290,A VISION,Insipid Royalty's keen condiment!                                  405
10291,A VISION,"_Therefore_, uninjured and unprofited"
10292,A VISION,"(Victims at once and executioners),"
10293,A VISION,The congregated Husbandmen lay waste
10294,A VISION,The vineyard and the harvest. As along
10295,A VISION,"The Bothnic coast, or southward of the Line,                       410"
10296,A VISION,"Though hushed the winds and cloudless the high noon,"
10297,A VISION,"Yet if Leviathan, weary of ease,"
10298,A VISION,"In sports unwieldy toss his island-bulk,"
10299,A VISION,"Ocean behind him billows, and before"
10300,A VISION,A storm of waves breaks foamy on the strand.                       415
10301,A VISION,"And hence, for times and seasons bloody and dark,"
10302,A VISION,"Short Peace shall skin the wounds of causeless War,"
10303,A VISION,"And War, his strainéd sinews knit anew,"
10304,A VISION,Still violate the unfinished works of Peace.
10305,A VISION,But yonder look! for more demands thy view!'                       420
10306,A VISION,He said: and straightway from the opposite Isle
10307,A VISION,"A vapour sailed, as when a cloud, exhaled"
10308,A VISION,"From Egypt's fields that steam hot pestilence,"
10309,A VISION,"Travels the sky for many a trackless league,"
10310,A VISION,"Till o'er some death-doomed land, distant in vain,                 425"
10311,A VISION,"It broods incumbent. Forthwith from the plain,"
10312,A VISION,"Facing the Isle, a brighter cloud arose,"
10313,A VISION,And steered its course which way the vapour went.
10314,A VISION,
10315,A VISION,"The Maiden paused, musing what this might mean."
10316,A VISION,"But long time passed not, ere that brighter cloud                  430"
10317,A VISION,Returned more bright; along the plain it swept;
10318,A VISION,And soon from forth its bursting sides emerged
10319,A VISION,"A dazzling form, broad-bosomed, bold of eye,"
10320,A VISION,"And wild her hair, save where with laurels bound."
10321,A VISION,"Not more majestic stood the healing God,[146:1]                    435"
10322,A VISION,When from his bow the arrow sped that slew
10323,A VISION,"Huge Python. Shriek'd Ambition's giant throng,"
10324,A VISION,And with them hissed the locust-fiends that crawled
10325,A VISION,And glittered in Corruption's slimy track.
10326,A VISION,"Great was their wrath, for short they knew their reign;            440"
10327,A VISION,"And such commotion made they, and uproar,"
10328,A VISION,As when the mad Tornado bellows through
10329,A VISION,"The guilty islands of the western main,"
10330,A VISION,"What time departing from their native shores,[146:2]"
10331,A VISION,"Eboe, or Koromantyn's plain of palms,                              445"
10332,A VISION,The infuriate spirits of the murdered make
10333,A VISION,"Fierce merriment, and vengeance ask of Heaven."
10334,A VISION,"Warmed with new influence, the unwholesome plain"
10335,A VISION,Sent up its foulest fogs to meet the morn:
10336,A VISION,"The Sun that rose on Freedom, rose in Blood!                       450"
10337,A VISION,
10338,A VISION,"'Maiden beloved, and Delegate of Heaven!"
10339,A VISION,(To her the tutelary Spirit said)
10340,A VISION,"Soon shall the Morning struggle into Day,"
10341,A VISION,The stormy Morning into cloudless Noon.
10342,A VISION,"Much hast thou seen, nor all canst understand--                    455"
10343,A VISION,But this be thy best omen--Save thy Country!'
10344,A VISION,"Thus saying, from the answering Maid he passed,"
10345,A VISION,And with him disappeared the heavenly Vision.
10346,A VISION,
10347,A VISION,"'Glory to Thee, Father of Earth and Heaven!"
10348,A VISION,All-conscious Presence of the Universe!                            460
10349,A VISION,Nature's vast ever-acting Energy![147:1]
10350,A VISION,"In will, in deed, Impulse of All to All!"
10351,A VISION,Whether thy Love with unrefracted ray
10352,A VISION,"Beam on the Prophet's purgéd eye, or if"

10354,A VISION,"Scatter new frenzies on the infected throng,"
10355,A VISION,"Thou both inspiring and predooming both,"
10356,A VISION,"Fit instruments and best, of perfect end:"

10362,A VISION,More wild and waste and desolate than where

13024,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13025,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13026,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,_Foster-Mother._ I never saw the man whom you describe.
13027,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13028,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,_Maria._ 'Tis strange! he spake of you familiarly
13029,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,As mine and Albert's common Foster-mother.
13030,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13031,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"_Foster-Mother._ Now blessings on the man, whoe'er he be,"
13032,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"That joined your names with mine! O my sweet lady,                   5"
13033,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,As often as I think of those dear times
13034,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,When you two little ones would stand at eve
13035,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"On each side of my chair, and make me learn"
13036,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,All you had learnt in the day; and how to talk
13037,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"In gentle phrase, then bid me sing to you--                         10"
13038,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,'Tis more like heaven to come than what _has_ been!
13039,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13040,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,_Maria._ O my dear Mother! this strange man has left me
13041,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Troubled with wilder fancies, than the moon"
13042,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Breeds in the love-sick maid who gazes at it,"
13043,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Till lost in inward vision, with wet eye                            15"
13044,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"She gazes idly!--But that entrance, Mother!"
13045,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13046,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,_Foster-Mother._ Can no one hear? It is a perilous tale!
13047,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13048,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,_Maria._ No one.
13049,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13050,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"_Foster-Mother._ My husband's father told it me,"
13051,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,Poor old Leoni!--Angels rest his soul!
13052,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"He was a woodman, and could fell and saw                            20"
13053,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,With lusty arm. You know that huge round beam
13054,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,Which props the hanging wall of the old Chapel?
13055,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Beneath that tree, while yet it was a tree,"
13056,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"He found a baby wrapt in mosses, lined"
13057,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"With thistle-beards, and such small locks of wool                   25"
13058,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"As hang on brambles. Well, he brought him home,"
13059,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,And rear'd him at the then Lord Velez' cost.
13060,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"And so the babe grew up a pretty boy,"
13061,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"A pretty boy, but most unteachable--"
13062,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead,                         30"
13063,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"But knew the names of birds, and mock'd their notes,"
13064,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"And whistled, as he were a bird himself:"
13065,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,And all the autumn 'twas his only play
13066,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"To get the seeds of wild flowers, and to plant them"
13067,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"With earth and water, on the stumps of trees.                       35"
13068,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"A Friar, who gather'd simples in the wood,"
13069,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"A grey-haired man--he lov'd this little boy,"
13070,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"The boy lov'd him--and, when the Friar taught him,"
13071,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"He soon could write with the pen: and from that time,"
13072,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,Lived chiefly at the Convent or the Castle.                         40
13073,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,So he became a very learnéd youth.
13074,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"But Oh! poor wretch!--he read, and read, and read,"
13075,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Till his brain turn'd--and ere his twentieth year,"
13076,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,He had unlawful thoughts of many things:
13077,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"And though he prayed, he never lov'd to pray                        45"
13078,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"With holy men, nor in a holy place--"
13079,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"But yet his speech, it was so soft and sweet,"
13080,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,The late Lord Velez ne'er was wearied with him.
13081,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"And once, as by the north side of the Chapel"
13082,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"They stood together, chain'd in deep discourse,                     50"
13083,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"The earth heav'd under them with such a groan,"
13084,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"That the wall totter'd, and had well-nigh fallen"
13085,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,Right on their heads. My Lord was sorely frighten'd;
13086,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"A fever seiz'd him, and he made confession"
13087,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,Of all the heretical and lawless talk                               55
13088,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,Which brought this judgment: so the youth was seiz'd
13089,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,And cast into that hole. My husband's father
13090,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,Sobb'd like a child--it almost broke his heart:
13091,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"And once as he was working in the cellar,"
13092,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"He heard a voice distinctly; 'twas the youth's,                     60"
13093,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Who sung a doleful song about green fields,"
13094,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"How sweet it were on lake or wild savannah,"
13095,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"To hunt for food, and be a naked man,"
13096,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,And wander up and down at liberty.
13097,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"He always doted on the youth, and now                               65"
13098,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"His love grew desperate; and defying death,"
13099,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,He made that cunning entrance I describ'd:
13100,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,And the young man escap'd.
13101,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13102,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,_Maria._                   'Tis a sweet tale:
13103,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Such as would lull a listening child to sleep,"
13104,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,His rosy face besoil'd with unwiped tears.--                        70
13105,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,And what became of him?
13106,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,
13107,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,_Foster-Mother._ He went on shipboard
13108,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"With those bold voyagers, who made discovery"
13109,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,Of golden lands. Leoni's younger brother
13110,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Went likewise, and when he return'd to Spain,"
13111,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"He told Leoni, that the poor mad youth,                             75"
13112,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Soon after they arriv'd in that new world,"
13113,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"In spite of his dissuasion, seiz'd a boat,"
13114,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"And all alone, set sail by silent moonlight"
13115,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"Up a great river, great as any sea,"
13116,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,"And ne'er was heard of more: but 'tis suppos'd,                     80"
13117,A DRAMATIC FRAGMENT,He liv'd and died among the savage men.

13810,PART V,The upper air burst into life!
13811,PART V,"And a hundred fire-flags sheen,"

13813,PART V,"And to and fro, and in and out,"
13814,PART V,The wan stars danced between.
13815,PART V,
13816,PART V,"And the coming wind did roar more loud,"
13817,PART V,And the sails did sigh like sedge;
13818,PART V,And the rain poured down from one black cloud;                     320
13819,PART V,The Moon was at its edge.
13820,PART V,
13821,PART V,"The thick black cloud was cleft, and still"
13822,PART V,The Moon was at its side:
13823,PART V,"Like waters shot from some high crag,"
13824,PART V,"The lightning fell with never a jag,                               325"
13825,PART V,A river steep and wide.
13826,PART V,
13827,PART V,"[Sidenote: The bodies of the ship's crew are inspired [inspirited, S."

13829,PART V,
13830,PART V,"The loud wind never reached the ship,"
13831,PART V,Yet now the ship moved on!
13832,PART V,Beneath the lightning and the Moon
13833,PART V,The dead men gave a groan.                                         330
13834,PART V,
13835,PART V,"They groaned, they stirred, they all uprose,"
13836,PART V,"Nor spake, nor moved their eyes;"
13837,PART V,"It had been strange, even in a dream,"
13838,PART V,To have seen those dead men rise.
13839,PART V,
13840,PART V,"The helmsman steered, the ship moved on;                           335"
13841,PART V,Yet never a breeze up-blew;
13842,PART V,"The mariners all 'gan work the ropes,"
13843,PART V,Where they were wont to do;
13844,PART V,They raised their limbs like lifeless tools--
13845,PART V,We were a ghastly crew.                                            340
13846,PART V,
13847,PART V,The body of my brother's son
13848,PART V,"Stood by me, knee to knee:"
13849,PART V,"The body and I pulled at one rope,"
13850,PART V,But he said nought to me.
13851,PART V,
13852,PART V,"[Sidenote: But not by the souls of the men, nor by dæmons of earth or"

13855,PART V,
13856,PART V,"'I fear thee, ancient Mariner!'                                    345"
13857,PART V,"Be calm, thou Wedding-Guest!"
13858,PART V,"'Twas not those souls that fled in pain,"
13859,PART V,"Which to their corses came again,"
13860,PART V,But a troop of spirits blest:
13861,PART V,
13862,PART V,"For when it dawned--they dropped their arms,"
13863,PART V,And clustered round the mast;                                      351
13864,PART V,"Sweet sounds rose slowly through their mouths,"
13865,PART V,And from their bodies passed.
13866,PART V,
13867,PART V,"Around, around, flew each sweet sound,"
13868,PART V,Then darted to the Sun;                                            355
13869,PART V,"Slowly the sounds came back again,"
13870,PART V,"Now mixed, now one by one."
13871,PART V,
13872,PART V,Sometimes a-dropping from the sky
13873,PART V,I heard the sky-lark sing;
13874,PART V,"Sometimes all little birds that are,                               360"
13875,PART V,How they seemed to fill the sea and air
13876,PART V,With their sweet jargoning!
13877,PART V,
13878,PART V,"And now 'twas like all instruments,"
13879,PART V,Now like a lonely flute;
13880,PART V,"And now it is an angel's song,                                     365"
13881,PART V,That makes the heavens be mute.
13882,PART V,
13883,PART V,It ceased; yet still the sails made on
13884,PART V,"A pleasant noise till noon,"
13885,PART V,A noise like of a hidden brook
13886,PART V,"In the leafy month of June,                                        370"
13887,PART V,That to the sleeping woods all night
13888,PART V,Singeth a quiet tune.
13889,PART V,
13890,PART V,"Till noon we quietly sailed on,"
13891,PART V,Yet never a breeze did breathe:
13892,PART V,"Slowly and smoothly went the ship,                                 375"
13893,PART V,Moved onward from beneath.
13894,PART V,
13895,PART V,[Sidenote: The lonesome Spirit from the south-pole carries on the ship
13896,PART V,"as far as the Line, in obedience to the angelic troop, but still"

13898,PART V,
13899,PART V,"Under the keel nine fathom deep,"
13900,PART V,"From the land of mist and snow,"
13901,PART V,The spirit slid: and it was he
13902,PART V,That made the ship to go.                                          380
13903,PART V,"The sails at noon left off their tune,"
13904,PART V,And the ship stood still also.
13905,PART V,
13906,PART V,"The Sun, right up above the mast,"
13907,PART V,Had fixed her to the ocean:
13908,PART V,"But in a minute she 'gan stir,                                     385"
13909,PART V,With a short uneasy motion--
13910,PART V,Backwards and forwards half her length
13911,PART V,With a short uneasy motion.
13912,PART V,
13913,PART V,"Then like a pawing horse let go,"
13914,PART V,She made a sudden bound:                                           390
13915,PART V,"It flung the blood into my head,"
13916,PART V,And I fell down in a swound.

13918,PART V,"[Sidenote: The Polar Spirit's fellow-dæmons, the invisible inhabitants"

13922,PART V,
13923,PART V,"How long in that same fit I lay,"

13926,PART V,I heard and in my soul discerned
13927,PART V,Two voices in the air.
13928,PART V,
13929,PART V,"'Is it he?' quoth one, 'Is this the man?"
13930,PART V,"By him who died on cross,"
13931,PART V,With his cruel bow he laid full low                                400
13932,PART V,The harmless Albatross.
13933,PART V,
13934,PART V,The spirit who bideth by himself
13935,PART V,"In the land of mist and snow,"
13936,PART V,He loved the bird that loved the man
13937,PART V,Who shot him with his bow.'                                        405
13938,PART V,
13939,PART V,"The other was a softer voice,"
13940,PART V,As soft as honey-dew:
13941,PART V,"Quoth he, 'The man hath penance done,"
13942,PART V,And penance more will do.'

13955,SECOND VOICE,
13956,SECOND VOICE,"'Still as a slave before his lord,"
13957,SECOND VOICE,The ocean hath no blast;                                           415

13962,SECOND VOICE,For she guides him smooth or grim.
13963,SECOND VOICE,"See, brother, see! how graciously                                  420"
13964,SECOND VOICE,She looketh down on him.'

13979,SECOND VOICE,
13980,SECOND VOICE,"Fly, brother, fly! more high, more high!"

13987,SECOND VOICE,
13988,SECOND VOICE,"I woke, and we were sailing on                                     430"
13989,SECOND VOICE,As in a gentle weather:
13990,SECOND VOICE,"'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;"
13991,SECOND VOICE,The dead men stood together.
13992,SECOND VOICE,
13993,SECOND VOICE,"All stood together on the deck,"
13994,SECOND VOICE,For a charnel-dungeon fitter:                                      435
13995,SECOND VOICE,"All fixed on me their stony eyes,"
13996,SECOND VOICE,That in the Moon did glitter.
13997,SECOND VOICE,
13998,SECOND VOICE,"The pang, the curse, with which they died,"
13999,SECOND VOICE,Had never passed away:
14000,SECOND VOICE,"I could not draw my eyes from theirs,                              440"
14001,SECOND VOICE,Nor turn them up to pray.
14002,SECOND VOICE,
14003,SECOND VOICE,[Sidenote: The curse is finally expiated.]
14004,SECOND VOICE,
14005,SECOND VOICE,And now this spell was snapt: once more
14006,SECOND VOICE,"I viewed the ocean green,"
14007,SECOND VOICE,"And looked far forth, yet little saw"
14008,SECOND VOICE,Of what had else been seen--                                       445
14009,SECOND VOICE,
14010,SECOND VOICE,"Like one, that on a lonesome road"
14011,SECOND VOICE,"Doth walk in fear and dread,"
14012,SECOND VOICE,"And having once turned round walks on,"
14013,SECOND VOICE,And turns no more his head;
14014,SECOND VOICE,"Because he knows, a frightful fiend                                450"
14015,SECOND VOICE,Doth close behind him tread.
14016,SECOND VOICE,
14017,SECOND VOICE,"But soon there breathed a wind on me,"
14018,SECOND VOICE,Nor sound nor motion made:
14019,SECOND VOICE,"Its path was not upon the sea,"
14020,SECOND VOICE,In ripple or in shade.                                             455
14021,SECOND VOICE,
14022,SECOND VOICE,"It raised my hair, it fanned my cheek"
14023,SECOND VOICE,Like a meadow-gale of spring--
14024,SECOND VOICE,"It mingled strangely with my fears,"
14025,SECOND VOICE,Yet it felt like a welcoming.
14026,SECOND VOICE,
14027,SECOND VOICE,"Swiftly, swiftly flew the ship,                                    460"
14028,SECOND VOICE,Yet she sailed softly too:
14029,SECOND VOICE,"Sweetly, sweetly blew the breeze--"
14030,SECOND VOICE,On me alone it blew.
14031,SECOND VOICE,
14032,SECOND VOICE,[Sidenote: And the ancient Mariner beholdeth his native country.]
14033,SECOND VOICE,
14034,SECOND VOICE,Oh! dream of joy! is this indeed
14035,SECOND VOICE,The light-house top I see?                                         465
14036,SECOND VOICE,Is this the hill? is this the kirk?
14037,SECOND VOICE,Is this mine own countree?
14038,SECOND VOICE,
14039,SECOND VOICE,"We drifted o'er the harbour-bar,"
14040,SECOND VOICE,And I with sobs did pray--
14041,SECOND VOICE,"O let me be awake, my God!                                         470"
14042,SECOND VOICE,Or let me sleep alway.
14043,SECOND VOICE,
14044,SECOND VOICE,"The harbour-bay was clear as glass,"
14045,SECOND VOICE,So smoothly it was strewn!
14046,SECOND VOICE,"And on the bay the moonlight lay,"
14047,SECOND VOICE,And the shadow of the Moon.                                        475
14048,SECOND VOICE,
14049,SECOND VOICE,"The rock shone bright, the kirk no less,"
14050,SECOND VOICE,That stands above the rock:
14051,SECOND VOICE,The moonlight steeped in silentness
14052,SECOND VOICE,The steady weathercock.
14053,SECOND VOICE,
14054,SECOND VOICE,"[Sidenote: The angelic spirits leave the dead bodies,]"
14055,SECOND VOICE,
14056,SECOND VOICE,"And the bay was white with silent light,                           480"
14057,SECOND VOICE,"Till rising from the same,"
14058,SECOND VOICE,"Full many shapes, that shadows were,"
14059,SECOND VOICE,In crimson colours came.
14060,SECOND VOICE,
14061,SECOND VOICE,[Sidenote: And appear in their own forms of light.]
14062,SECOND VOICE,
14063,SECOND VOICE,A little distance from the prow
14064,SECOND VOICE,Those crimson shadows were:                                        485
14065,SECOND VOICE,I turned my eyes upon the deck--
14066,SECOND VOICE,"Oh, Christ! what saw I there!"
14067,SECOND VOICE,
14068,SECOND VOICE,"Each corse lay flat, lifeless and flat,"
14069,SECOND VOICE,"And, by the holy rood!"
14070,SECOND VOICE,"A man all light, a seraph-man,                                     490"
14071,SECOND VOICE,On every corse there stood.
14072,SECOND VOICE,
14073,SECOND VOICE,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand:"
14074,SECOND VOICE,It was a heavenly sight!
14075,SECOND VOICE,"They stood as signals to the land,"
14076,SECOND VOICE,Each one a lovely light;                                           495
14077,SECOND VOICE,
14078,SECOND VOICE,"This seraph-band, each waved his hand,"
14079,SECOND VOICE,No voice did they impart--
14080,SECOND VOICE,No voice; but oh! the silence sank
14081,SECOND VOICE,Like music on my heart.
14082,SECOND VOICE,
14083,SECOND VOICE,"But soon I heard the dash of oars,                                 500"
14084,SECOND VOICE,I heard the Pilot's cheer;
14085,SECOND VOICE,"My head was turned perforce away,"
14086,SECOND VOICE,And I saw a boat appear.
14087,SECOND VOICE,
14088,SECOND VOICE,"The Pilot and the Pilot's boy,"
14089,SECOND VOICE,I heard them coming fast:                                          505
14090,SECOND VOICE,Dear Lord in Heaven! it was a joy
14091,SECOND VOICE,The dead men could not blast.
14092,SECOND VOICE,
14093,SECOND VOICE,I saw a third--I heard his voice:
14094,SECOND VOICE,It is the Hermit good!
14095,SECOND VOICE,He singeth loud his godly hymns                                    510
14096,SECOND VOICE,That he makes in the wood.
14097,SECOND VOICE,"He'll shrieve my soul, he'll wash away"
14098,SECOND VOICE,The Albatross's blood.

14107,PART VII,How loudly his sweet voice he rears!
14108,PART VII,He loves to talk with marineres
14109,PART VII,That come from a far countree.
14110,PART VII,
14111,PART VII,"He kneels at morn, and noon, and eve--"
14112,PART VII,He hath a cushion plump:                                           520

14122,PART VII,
14123,PART VII,"'Strange, by my faith!' the Hermit said--"
14124,PART VII,'And they answered not our cheer!
14125,PART VII,"The planks looked warped! and see those sails,"

15062,PREFACE,PREFACE
15063,PREFACE,
15064,PREFACE,The first part of the following poem was written in the
15065,PREFACE,"year 1797, at Stowey, in the county of Somerset. The"
15066,PREFACE,"second part, after my return from Germany, in the year"
15067,PREFACE,"1800, at Keswick, Cumberland. It is probable that if the"
15068,PREFACE,"poem had been finished at either of the former periods, or             5"
15069,PREFACE,if even the first and second part had been published in the
15070,PREFACE,"year 1800, the impression of its originality would have been"
15071,PREFACE,much greater than I dare at present expect. But for this
15072,PREFACE,I have only my own indolence to blame. The dates are
15073,PREFACE,mentioned for the exclusive purpose of precluding charges of          10
15074,PREFACE,plagiarism or servile imitation from myself. For there is
15075,PREFACE,"amongst us a set of critics, who seem to hold, that every"
15076,PREFACE,possible thought and image is traditional; who have no
15077,PREFACE,"notion that there are such things as fountains in the world,"
15078,PREFACE,small as well as great; and who would therefore charitably            15
15079,PREFACE,"derive every rill they behold flowing, from a perforation"
15080,PREFACE,"made in some other man's tank. I am confident, however,"
15081,PREFACE,"that as far as the present poem is concerned, the celebrated"
15082,PREFACE,poets[215:1] whose writings I might be suspected of having
15083,PREFACE,"imitated, either in particular passages, or in the tone and           20"
15084,PREFACE,"the spirit of the whole, would be among the first to vindicate"
15085,PREFACE,"me from the charge, and who, on any striking coincidence,"
15086,PREFACE,would permit me to address them in this doggerel version
15087,PREFACE,of two monkish Latin hexameters.[215:2]
15088,PREFACE,
15089,PREFACE,'Tis mine and it is likewise yours;                                 25

15094,PREFACE,"I have only to add that the metre of Christabel is not,"
15095,PREFACE,"properly speaking, irregular, though it may seem so from its          30"
15096,PREFACE,"being founded on a new principle: namely, that of counting"
15097,PREFACE,"in each line the accents, not the syllables. Though the latter"
15098,PREFACE,"may vary from seven to twelve, yet in each line the accents"
15099,PREFACE,"will be found to be only four. Nevertheless, this occasional"
15100,PREFACE,"variation in number of syllables is not introduced wantonly,          35"
15101,PREFACE,"or for the mere ends of convenience, but in correspondence"
15102,PREFACE,with some transition in the nature of the imagery or passion.

15107,PART I,"'Tis the middle of night by the castle clock,"
15108,PART I,And the owls have awakened the crowing cock;
15109,PART I,Tu--whit!----Tu--whoo!
15110,PART I,"And hark, again! the crowing cock,"
15111,PART I,How drowsily it crew.                                                5
15112,PART I,"Sir Leoline, the Baron rich,"
15113,PART I,Hath a toothless mastiff bitch;
15114,PART I,From her kennel beneath the rock
15115,PART I,"She maketh answer to the clock,"
15116,PART I,"Four for the quarters, and twelve for the hour;                     10"
15117,PART I,"Ever and aye, by shine and shower,"
15118,PART I,"Sixteen short howls, not over loud;"
15119,PART I,"Some say, she sees my lady's shroud."
15120,PART I,
15121,PART I,Is the night chilly and dark?
15122,PART I,"The night is chilly, but not dark.                                  15"
15123,PART I,"The thin gray cloud is spread on high,"
15124,PART I,It covers but not hides the sky.
15125,PART I,"The moon is behind, and at the full;"
15126,PART I,And yet she looks both small and dull.
15127,PART I,"The night is chill, the cloud is gray:                              20"
15128,PART I,"'Tis a month before the month of May,"
15129,PART I,And the Spring comes slowly up this way.
15130,PART I,
15131,PART I,"The lovely lady, Christabel,"
15132,PART I,"Whom her father loves so well,"
15133,PART I,"What makes her in the wood so late,                                 25"
15134,PART I,A furlong from the castle gate?
15135,PART I,She had dreams all yesternight
15136,PART I,Of her own betrothéd knight;
15137,PART I,And she in the midnight wood will pray
15138,PART I,For the weal of her lover that's far away.                          30
15139,PART I,
15140,PART I,"She stole along, she nothing spoke,"
15141,PART I,"The sighs she heaved were soft and low,"
15142,PART I,And naught was green upon the oak
15143,PART I,But moss and rarest misletoe:
15144,PART I,"She kneels beneath the huge oak tree,                               35"
15145,PART I,And in silence prayeth she.
15146,PART I,
15147,PART I,"The lady sprang up suddenly,"
15148,PART I,"The lovely lady, Christabel!"
15149,PART I,"It moaned as near, as near can be,"
15150,PART I,But what it is she cannot tell.--                                   40
15151,PART I,"On the other side it seems to be,"
15152,PART I,"Of the huge, broad-breasted, old oak tree."
15153,PART I,
15154,PART I,The night is chill; the forest bare;
15155,PART I,Is it the wind that moaneth bleak?
15156,PART I,There is not wind enough in the air                                 45
15157,PART I,To move away the ringlet curl
15158,PART I,From the lovely lady's cheek--
15159,PART I,There is not wind enough to twirl
15160,PART I,"The one red leaf, the last of its clan,"
15161,PART I,"That dances as often as dance it can,                               50"
15162,PART I,"Hanging so light, and hanging so high,"
15163,PART I,On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.
15164,PART I,
15165,PART I,"Hush, beating heart of Christabel!"
15166,PART I,"Jesu, Maria, shield her well!"
15167,PART I,"She folded her arms beneath her cloak,                              55"
15168,PART I,And stole to the other side of the oak.
15169,PART I,What sees she there?
15170,PART I,
15171,PART I,"There she sees a damsel bright,"
15172,PART I,"Drest in a silken robe of white,"
15173,PART I,That shadowy in the moonlight shone:                                60
15174,PART I,"The neck that made that white robe wan,"
15175,PART I,"Her stately neck, and arms were bare;"
15176,PART I,"Her blue-veined feet unsandal'd were,"
15177,PART I,And wildly glittered here and there
15178,PART I,The gems entangled in her hair.                                     65
15179,PART I,"I guess, 'twas frightful there to see"
15180,PART I,A lady so richly clad as she--
15181,PART I,Beautiful exceedingly!
15182,PART I,
15183,PART I,"Mary mother, save me now!"
15184,PART I,"(Said Christabel,) And who art thou?                                70"
15185,PART I,
15186,PART I,"The lady strange made answer meet,"
15187,PART I,And her voice was faint and sweet:--
15188,PART I,"Have pity on my sore distress,"
15189,PART I,I scarce can speak for weariness:
15190,PART I,"Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear!                           75"
15191,PART I,"Said Christabel, How camest thou here?"
15192,PART I,"And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet,"
15193,PART I,Did thus pursue her answer meet:--
15194,PART I,
15195,PART I,"My sire is of a noble line,"
15196,PART I,And my name is Geraldine:                                           80
15197,PART I,"Five warriors seized me yestermorn,"
15198,PART I,"Me, even me, a maid forlorn:"
15199,PART I,"They choked my cries with force and fright,"
15200,PART I,And tied me on a palfrey white.
15201,PART I,"The palfrey was as fleet as wind,                                   85"
15202,PART I,And they rode furiously behind.
15203,PART I,"They spurred amain, their steeds were white:"
15204,PART I,And once we crossed the shade of night.
15205,PART I,"As sure as Heaven shall rescue me,"
15206,PART I,I have no thought what men they be;                                 90
15207,PART I,Nor do I know how long it is
15208,PART I,(For I have lain entranced I wis)
15209,PART I,"Since one, the tallest of the five,"
15210,PART I,"Took me from the palfrey's back,"
15211,PART I,"A weary woman, scarce alive.                                        95"
15212,PART I,Some muttered words his comrades spoke:
15213,PART I,Ha placed me underneath this oak;
15214,PART I,He swore they would return with haste;
15215,PART I,Whither they went I cannot tell--
15216,PART I,"I thought I heard, some minutes past,                              100"
15217,PART I,Sounds as of a castle bell.
15218,PART I,"Stretch forth thy hand (thus ended she),"
15219,PART I,And help a wretched maid to flee.
15220,PART I,
15221,PART I,"Then Christabel stretched forth her hand,"
15222,PART I,And comforted fair Geraldine:                                      105
15223,PART I,"O well, bright dame! may you command"
15224,PART I,The service of Sir Leoline;
15225,PART I,And gladly our stout chivalry
15226,PART I,Will he send forth and friends withal
15227,PART I,To guide and guard you safe and free                               110
15228,PART I,Home to your noble father's hall.
15229,PART I,
15230,PART I,She rose: and forth with steps they passed
15231,PART I,"That strove to be, and were not, fast."
15232,PART I,"Her gracious stars the lady blest,"
15233,PART I,And thus spake on sweet Christabel:                                115
15234,PART I,"All our household are at rest,"
15235,PART I,The hall as silent as the cell;
15236,PART I,"Sir Leoline is weak in health,"
15237,PART I,"And may not well awakened be,"
15238,PART I,"But we will move as if in stealth,                                 120"
15239,PART I,"And I beseech your courtesy,"
15240,PART I,"This night, to share your couch with me."
15241,PART I,
15242,PART I,"They crossed the moat, and Christabel"
15243,PART I,Took the key that fitted well;
15244,PART I,"A little door she opened straight,                                 125"
15245,PART I,All in the middle of the gate;
15246,PART I,"The gate that was ironed within and without,"
15247,PART I,Where an army in battle array had marched out.
15248,PART I,"The lady sank, belike through pain,"
15249,PART I,And Christabel with might and main                                 130
15250,PART I,"Lifted her up, a weary weight,"
15251,PART I,Over the threshold of the gate:
15252,PART I,"Then the lady rose again,"
15253,PART I,"And moved, as she were not in pain."
15254,PART I,
15255,PART I,"So free from danger, free from fear,                               135"
15256,PART I,They crossed the court: right glad they were.
15257,PART I,And Christabel devoutly cried
15258,PART I,"To the lady by her side,"
15259,PART I,Praise we the Virgin all divine
15260,PART I,Who hath rescued thee from thy distress!                           140
15261,PART I,"Alas, alas! said Geraldine,"
15262,PART I,I cannot speak for weariness.
15263,PART I,"So free from danger, free from fear,"
15264,PART I,They crossed the court: right glad they were.
15265,PART I,
15266,PART I,"Outside her kennel, the mastiff old                                145"
15267,PART I,"Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold."
15268,PART I,"The mastiff old did not awake,"
15269,PART I,Yet she an angry moan did make!
15270,PART I,And what can ail the mastiff bitch?
15271,PART I,Never till now she uttered yell                                    150
15272,PART I,Beneath the eye of Christabel.
15273,PART I,Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch:
15274,PART I,For what can ail the mastiff bitch?
15275,PART I,
15276,PART I,"They passed the hall, that echoes still,"
15277,PART I,Pass as lightly as you will!                                       155
15278,PART I,"The brands were flat, the brands were dying,"
15279,PART I,Amid their own white ashes lying;
15280,PART I,"But when the lady passed, there came"
15281,PART I,"A tongue of light, a fit of flame;"
15282,PART I,"And Christabel saw the lady's eye,                                 160"
15283,PART I,"And nothing else saw she thereby,"
15284,PART I,"Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall,"
15285,PART I,Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall.
15286,PART I,"O softly tread, said Christabel,"
15287,PART I,My father seldom sleepeth well.                                    165
15288,PART I,
15289,PART I,"Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare,"
15290,PART I,And jealous of the listening air
15291,PART I,"They steal their way from stair to stair,"
15292,PART I,"Now in glimmer, and now in gloom,"
15293,PART I,"And now they pass the Baron's room,                                170"
15294,PART I,"As still as death, with stifled breath!"
15295,PART I,And now have reached her chamber door;
15296,PART I,And now doth Geraldine press down
15297,PART I,The rushes of the chamber floor.
15298,PART I,
15299,PART I,"The moon shines dim in the open air,                               175"
15300,PART I,And not a moonbeam enters here.
15301,PART I,But they without its light can see
15302,PART I,"The chamber carved so curiously,"
15303,PART I,"Carved with figures strange and sweet,"
15304,PART I,"All made out of the carver's brain,                                180"
15305,PART I,For a lady's chamber meet:
15306,PART I,The lamp with twofold silver chain
15307,PART I,Is fastened to an angel's feet.
15308,PART I,
15309,PART I,The silver lamp burns dead and dim;
15310,PART I,But Christabel the lamp will trim.                                 185
15311,PART I,"She trimmed the lamp, and made it bright,"
15312,PART I,"And left it swinging to and fro,"
15313,PART I,"While Geraldine, in wretched plight,"
15314,PART I,Sank down upon the floor below.
15315,PART I,
15316,PART I,"O weary lady, Geraldine,                                           190"
15317,PART I,"I pray you, drink this cordial wine!"
15318,PART I,It is a wine of virtuous powers;
15319,PART I,My mother made it of wild flowers.
15320,PART I,
15321,PART I,"And will your mother pity me,"
15322,PART I,Who am a maiden most forlorn?                                      195
15323,PART I,Christabel answered--Woe is me!
15324,PART I,She died the hour that I was born.
15325,PART I,I have heard the grey-haired friar tell
15326,PART I,"How on her death-bed she did say,"
15327,PART I,That she should hear the castle-bell                               200
15328,PART I,Strike twelve upon my wedding-day.
15329,PART I,O mother dear! that thou wert here!
15330,PART I,"I would, said Geraldine, she were!"
15331,PART I,
15332,PART I,"But soon with altered voice, said she--"
15333,PART I,"'Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine!                             205"
15334,PART I,I have power to bid thee flee.'
15335,PART I,Alas! what ails poor Geraldine?
15336,PART I,Why stares she with unsettled eye?
15337,PART I,Can she the bodiless dead espy?
15338,PART I,"And why with hollow voice cries she,                               210"
15339,PART I,"'Off, woman, off! this hour is mine--"
15340,PART I,"Though thou her guardian spirit be,"
15341,PART I,"Off, woman, off! 'tis given to me.'"
15342,PART I,
15343,PART I,"Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side,"
15344,PART I,And raised to heaven her eyes so blue--                            215
15345,PART I,"Alas! said she, this ghastly ride--"
15346,PART I,Dear lady! it hath wildered you!
15347,PART I,"The lady wiped her moist cold brow,"
15348,PART I,"And faintly said, ''tis over now!'"
15349,PART I,
15350,PART I,Again the wild-flower wine she drank:                              220
15351,PART I,"Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright,"
15352,PART I,"And from the floor whereon she sank,"
15353,PART I,The lofty lady stood upright:
15354,PART I,"She was most beautiful to see,"
15355,PART I,Like a lady of a far countrée.                                     225
15356,PART I,
15357,PART I,And thus the lofty lady spake--
15358,PART I,"'All they who live in the upper sky,"
15359,PART I,"Do love you, holy Christabel!"
15360,PART I,"And you love them, and for their sake"
15361,PART I,"And for the good which me befel,                                   230"
15362,PART I,"Even I in my degree will try,"
15363,PART I,"Fair maiden, to requite you well."
15364,PART I,But now unrobe yourself; for I
15365,PART I,"Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie.'"
15366,PART I,
15367,PART I,"Quoth Christabel, So let it be!                                    235"
15368,PART I,"And as the lady bade, did she."
15369,PART I,"Her gentle limbs did she undress,"
15370,PART I,And lay down in her loveliness.
15371,PART I,
15372,PART I,But through her brain of weal and woe
15373,PART I,"So many thoughts moved to and fro,                                 240"
15374,PART I,That vain it were her lids to close;
15375,PART I,"So half-way from the bed she rose,"
15376,PART I,And on her elbow did recline
15377,PART I,To look at the lady Geraldine.
15378,PART I,
15379,PART I,"Beneath the lamp the lady bowed,                                   245"
15380,PART I,And slowly rolled her eyes around;
15381,PART I,"Then drawing in her breath aloud,"
15382,PART I,"Like one that shuddered, she unbound"
15383,PART I,The cincture from beneath her breast:
15384,PART I,"Her silken robe, and inner vest,                                   250"
15385,PART I,"Dropt to her feet, and full in view,"
15386,PART I,Behold! her bosom and half her side--
15387,PART I,"A sight to dream of, not to tell!"
15388,PART I,O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!
15389,PART I,
15390,PART I,Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs;                                255
15391,PART I,Ah! what a stricken look was hers!
15392,PART I,Deep from within she seems half-way
15393,PART I,"To lift some weight with sick assay,"
15394,PART I,And eyes the maid and seeks delay;
15395,PART I,"Then suddenly, as one defied,                                      260"
15396,PART I,"Collects herself in scorn and pride,"
15397,PART I,And lay down by the Maiden's side!--
15398,PART I,"And in her arms the maid she took,"
15399,PART I,Ah wel-a-day!
15400,PART I,And with low voice and doleful look                                265
15401,PART I,These words did say:
15402,PART I,"'In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell,"
15403,PART I,"Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel!"
15404,PART I,"Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,"
15405,PART I,"This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;                     270"
15406,PART I,"But vainly thou warrest,"
15407,PART I,For this is alone in
15408,PART I,"Thy power to declare,"
15409,PART I,That in the dim forest
15410,PART I,"Thou heard'st a low moaning,                                 275"
15411,PART I,"And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair;"
15412,PART I,"And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity,"
15413,PART I,To shield her and shelter her from the damp air.'

15417,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,
15418,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,It was a lovely sight to see
15419,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"The lady Christabel, when she                                      280"
15420,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Was praying at the old oak tree.
15421,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Amid the jaggéd shadows
15422,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Of mossy leafless boughs,"
15423,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Kneeling in the moonlight,"
15424,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,To make her gentle vows;                                       285
15425,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Her slender palms together prest,"
15426,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Heaving sometimes on her breast;
15427,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Her face resigned to bliss or bale--
15428,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Her face, oh call it fair not pale,"
15429,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"And both blue eyes more bright than clear,                         290"
15430,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Each about to have a tear.
15431,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,
15432,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,With open eyes (ah woe is me!)
15433,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Asleep, and dreaming fearfully,"
15434,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Fearfully dreaming, yet, I wis,"
15435,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Dreaming that alone, which is--                                    295"
15436,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"O sorrow and shame! Can this be she,"
15437,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"The lady, who knelt at the old oak tree?"
15438,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"And lo! the worker of these harms,"
15439,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"That holds the maiden in her arms,"
15440,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Seems to slumber still and mild,                                   300"
15441,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,As a mother with her child.
15442,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,
15443,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"A star hath set, a star hath risen,"
15444,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,O Geraldine! since arms of thine
15445,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Have been the lovely lady's prison.
15446,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,O Geraldine! one hour was thine--                                  305
15447,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Thou'st had thy will! By tairn and rill,"
15448,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,The night-birds all that hour were still.
15449,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"But now they are jubilant anew,"
15450,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"From cliff and tower, tu--whoo! tu--whoo!"
15451,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Tu--whoo! tu--whoo! from wood and fell!                            310
15452,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,
15453,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,And see! the lady Christabel
15454,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Gathers herself from out her trance;
15455,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Her limbs relax, her countenance"
15456,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Grows sad and soft; the smooth thin lids
15457,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Close o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds--                         315
15458,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Large tears that leave the lashes bright!
15459,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,And oft the while she seems to smile
15460,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,As infants at a sudden light!
15461,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,
15462,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Yea, she doth smile, and she doth weep,"

15466,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"And, if she move unquietly,"
15467,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"Perchance, 'tis but the blood so free"
15468,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,Comes back and tingles in her feet.                                325
15469,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"No doubt, she hath a vision sweet."
15470,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"What if her guardian spirit 'twere,"

15472,THE CONCLUSION TO PART I,"But this she knows, in joys and woes,"

15481,PART II,"Each matin bell, the Baron saith,"
15482,PART II,Knells us back to a world of death.
15483,PART II,"These words Sir Leoline first said,"
15484,PART II,When he rose and found his lady dead:                              335
15485,PART II,These words Sir Leoline will say
15486,PART II,Many a morn to his dying day!
15487,PART II,
15488,PART II,And hence the custom and law began
15489,PART II,"That still at dawn the sacristan,"
15490,PART II,"Who duly pulls the heavy bell,                                     340"
15491,PART II,Five and forty beads must tell
15492,PART II,"Between each stroke--a warning knell,"
15493,PART II,Which not a soul can choose but hear
15494,PART II,From Bratha Head to Wyndermere.
15495,PART II,
15496,PART II,"Saith Bracy the bard, So let it knell!                             345"
15497,PART II,And let the drowsy sacristan
15498,PART II,Still count as slowly as he can!
15499,PART II,"There is no lack of such, I ween,"
15500,PART II,As well fill up the space between.
15501,PART II,"In Langdale Pike and Witch's Lair,                                 350"
15502,PART II,"And Dungeon-ghyll so foully rent,"
15503,PART II,With ropes of rock and bells of air
15504,PART II,"Three sinful sextons' ghosts are pent,"
15505,PART II,"Who all give back, one after t'other,"
15506,PART II,The death-note to their living brother;                            355
15507,PART II,"And oft too, by the knell offended,"
15508,PART II,"Just as their one! two! three! is ended,"
15509,PART II,The devil mocks the doleful tale
15510,PART II,With a merry peal from Borodale.
15511,PART II,
15512,PART II,The air is still! through mist and cloud                           360
15513,PART II,That merry peal comes ringing loud;
15514,PART II,"And Geraldine shakes off her dread,"
15515,PART II,And rises lightly from the bed;
15516,PART II,"Puts on her silken vestments white,"
15517,PART II,"And tricks her hair in lovely plight,                              365"
15518,PART II,And nothing doubting of her spell
15519,PART II,Awakens the lady Christabel.
15520,PART II,"'Sleep you, sweet lady Christabel?"
15521,PART II,I trust that you have rested well.'
15522,PART II,
15523,PART II,And Christabel awoke and spied                                     370
15524,PART II,The same who lay down by her side--
15525,PART II,"O rather say, the same whom she"
15526,PART II,Raised up beneath the old oak tree!
15527,PART II,"Nay, fairer yet! and yet more fair!"
15528,PART II,For she belike hath drunken deep                                   375
15529,PART II,Of all the blessedness of sleep!
15530,PART II,"And while she spake, her looks, her air"
15531,PART II,"Such gentle thankfulness declare,"
15532,PART II,That (so it seemed) her girded vests
15533,PART II,Grew tight beneath her heaving breasts.                            380
15534,PART II,"'Sure I have sinn'd!' said Christabel,"
15535,PART II,'Now heaven be praised if all be well!'
15536,PART II,"And in low faltering tones, yet sweet,"
15537,PART II,Did she the lofty lady greet
15538,PART II,With such perplexity of mind                                       385
15539,PART II,As dreams too lively leave behind.
15540,PART II,
15541,PART II,"So quickly she rose, and quickly arrayed"
15542,PART II,"Her maiden limbs, and having prayed"
15543,PART II,"That He, who on the cross did groan,"
15544,PART II,"Might wash away her sins unknown,                                  390"
15545,PART II,She forthwith led fair Geraldine
15546,PART II,"To meet her sire, Sir Leoline."
15547,PART II,
15548,PART II,The lovely maid and the lady tall
15549,PART II,"Are pacing both into the hall,"
15550,PART II,"And pacing on through page and groom,                              395"
15551,PART II,Enter the Baron's presence-room.
15552,PART II,
15553,PART II,"The Baron rose, and while he prest"
15554,PART II,"His gentle daughter to his breast,"
15555,PART II,With cheerful wonder in his eyes
15556,PART II,"The lady Geraldine espies,                                         400"
15557,PART II,"And gave such welcome to the same,"
15558,PART II,As might beseem so bright a dame!
15559,PART II,
15560,PART II,"But when he heard the lady's tale,"
15561,PART II,"And when she told her father's name,"
15562,PART II,"Why waxed Sir Leoline so pale,                                     405"
15563,PART II,"Murmuring o'er the name again,"
15564,PART II,Lord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine?
15565,PART II,Alas! they had been friends in youth;
15566,PART II,But whispering tongues can poison truth;
15567,PART II,And constancy lives in realms above;                               410
15568,PART II,And life is thorny; and youth is vain;
15569,PART II,And to be wroth with one we love
15570,PART II,Doth work like madness in the brain.
15571,PART II,"And thus it chanced, as I divine,"
15572,PART II,With Roland and Sir Leoline.                                       415
15573,PART II,Each spake words of high disdain
15574,PART II,And insult to his heart's best brother:
15575,PART II,They parted--ne'er to meet again!
15576,PART II,But never either found another
15577,PART II,To free the hollow heart from paining--                            420
15578,PART II,"They stood aloof, the scars remaining,"
15579,PART II,Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
15580,PART II,A dreary sea now flows between;--
15581,PART II,"But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,"
15582,PART II,"Shall wholly do away, I ween,                                      425"
15583,PART II,The marks of that which once hath been.
15584,PART II,
15585,PART II,"Sir Leoline, a moment's space,"
15586,PART II,Stood gazing on the damsel's face:
15587,PART II,And the youthful Lord of Tryermaine
15588,PART II,Came back upon his heart again.                                    430
15589,PART II,
15590,PART II,"O then the Baron forgot his age,"
15591,PART II,His noble heart swelled high with rage;
15592,PART II,He swore by the wounds in Jesu's side
15593,PART II,"He would proclaim it far and wide,"
15594,PART II,"With trump and solemn heraldry,                                    435"
15595,PART II,"That they, who thus had wronged the dame,"
15596,PART II,Were base as spotted infamy!
15597,PART II,"'And if they dare deny the same,"
15598,PART II,"My herald shall appoint a week,"
15599,PART II,And let the recreant traitors seek                                 440
15600,PART II,My tourney court--that there and then
15601,PART II,I may dislodge their reptile souls
15602,PART II,From the bodies and forms of men!'
15603,PART II,He spake: his eye in lightning rolls!
15604,PART II,For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned                  445
15605,PART II,In the beautiful lady the child of his friend!
15606,PART II,
15607,PART II,"And now the tears were on his face,"
15608,PART II,And fondly in his arms he took
15609,PART II,"Fair Geraldine, who met the embrace,"
15610,PART II,Prolonging it with joyous look.                                    450
15611,PART II,"Which when she viewed, a vision fell"
15612,PART II,"Upon the soul of Christabel,"
15613,PART II,"The vision of fear, the touch and pain!"
15614,PART II,"She shrunk and shuddered, and saw again--"
15615,PART II,"(Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee,                                   455"
15616,PART II,Thou gentle maid! such sights to see?)
15617,PART II,
15618,PART II,"Again she saw that bosom old,"
15619,PART II,"Again she felt that bosom cold,"
15620,PART II,And drew in her breath with a hissing sound:
15621,PART II,"Whereat the Knight turned wildly round,                            460"
15622,PART II,"And nothing saw, but his own sweet maid"
15623,PART II,"With eyes upraised, as one that prayed."
15624,PART II,
15625,PART II,"The touch, the sight, had passed away,"
15626,PART II,"And in its stead that vision blest,"
15627,PART II,Which comforted her after-rest                                     465
15628,PART II,"While in the lady's arms she lay,"
15629,PART II,"Had put a rapture in her breast,"
15630,PART II,And on her lips and o'er her eyes
15631,PART II,Spread smiles like light!
15632,PART II,"With new surprise,"
15633,PART II,'What ails then my belovéd child?'                                 470
15634,PART II,The Baron said--His daughter mild
15635,PART II,"Made answer, 'All will yet be well!'"
15636,PART II,"I ween, she had no power to tell"
15637,PART II,Aught else: so mighty was the spell.
15638,PART II,
15639,PART II,"Yet he, who saw this Geraldine,                                    475"
15640,PART II,Had deemed her sure a thing divine:
15641,PART II,"Such sorrow with such grace she blended,"
15642,PART II,As if she feared she had offended
15643,PART II,"Sweet Christabel, that gentle maid!"
15644,PART II,And with such lowly tones she prayed                               480
15645,PART II,She might be sent without delay
15646,PART II,Home to her father's mansion.
15647,PART II,'Nay!
15648,PART II,"Nay, by my soul!' said Leoline."
15649,PART II,"'Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine!"

15651,PART II,"And take two steeds with trappings proud,"
15652,PART II,And take the youth whom thou lov'st best
15653,PART II,"To bear thy harp, and learn thy song,"
15654,PART II,"And clothe you both in solemn vest,"
15655,PART II,"And over the mountains haste along,                                490"
15656,PART II,"Lest wandering folk, that are abroad,"
15657,PART II,Detain you on the valley road.
15658,PART II,
15659,PART II,"'And when he has crossed the Irthing flood,"
15660,PART II,"My merry bard! he hastes, he hastes"
15661,PART II,"Up Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood,                           495"
15662,PART II,And reaches soon that castle good
15663,PART II,Which stands and threatens Scotland's wastes.
15664,PART II,
15665,PART II,"'Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet,"
15666,PART II,"Ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet,"
15667,PART II,More loud than your horses' echoing feet!                          500
15668,PART II,"And loud and loud to Lord Roland call,"
15669,PART II,Thy daughter is safe in Langdale hall!
15670,PART II,Thy beautiful daughter is safe and free--
15671,PART II,Sir Leoline greets thee thus through me!
15672,PART II,He bids thee come without delay                                    505
15673,PART II,With all thy numerous array
15674,PART II,And take thy lovely daughter home:
15675,PART II,And he will meet thee on the way
15676,PART II,With all his numerous array
15677,PART II,White with their panting palfreys' foam:                           510
15678,PART II,"And, by mine honour! I will say,"
15679,PART II,That I repent me of the day
15680,PART II,When I spake words of fierce disdain
15681,PART II,To Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!--
15682,PART II,"--For since that evil hour hath flown,                             515"
15683,PART II,Many a summer's sun hath shone;
15684,PART II,Yet ne'er found I a friend again
15685,PART II,Like Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine.'
15686,PART II,
15687,PART II,"The lady fell, and clasped his knees,"
15688,PART II,"Her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing;                           520"
15689,PART II,"And Bracy replied, with faltering voice,"
15690,PART II,His gracious Hail on all bestowing!--
15691,PART II,"'Thy words, thou sire of Christabel,"
15692,PART II,Are sweeter than my harp can tell;
15693,PART II,"Yet might I gain a boon of thee,                                   525"
15694,PART II,"This day my journey should not be,"
15695,PART II,"So strange a dream hath come to me,"
15696,PART II,That I had vowed with music loud
15697,PART II,"To clear yon wood from thing unblest,"
15698,PART II,Warned by a vision in my rest!                                     530
15699,PART II,"For in my sleep I saw that dove,"
15700,PART II,"That gentle bird, whom thou dost love,"
15701,PART II,And call'st by thy own daughter's name--
15702,PART II,Sir Leoline! I saw the same
15703,PART II,"Fluttering, and uttering fearful moan,                             535"
15704,PART II,Among the green herbs in the forest alone.
15705,PART II,"Which when I saw and when I heard,"
15706,PART II,I wonder'd what might ail the bird;
15707,PART II,"For nothing near it could I see,"
15708,PART II,Save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree.
15709,PART II,
15710,PART II,'And in my dream methought I went                                  541
15711,PART II,To search out what might there be found;
15712,PART II,"And what the sweet bird's trouble meant,"
15713,PART II,That thus lay fluttering on the ground.
15714,PART II,"I went and peered, and could descry                                545"
15715,PART II,No cause for her distressful cry;
15716,PART II,But yet for her dear lady's sake
15717,PART II,"I stooped, methought, the dove to take,"
15718,PART II,When lo! I saw a bright green snake
15719,PART II,Coiled around its wings and neck.                                  550
15720,PART II,"Green as the herbs on which it couched,"
15721,PART II,Close by the dove's its head it crouched;
15722,PART II,"And with the dove it heaves and stirs,"
15723,PART II,Swelling its neck as she swelled hers!
15724,PART II,"I woke; it was the midnight hour,                                  555"
15725,PART II,The clock was echoing in the tower;
15726,PART II,"But though my slumber was gone by,"
15727,PART II,This dream it would not pass away--
15728,PART II,It seems to live upon my eye!
15729,PART II,And thence I vowed this self-same day                              560
15730,PART II,With music strong and saintly song
15731,PART II,"To wander through the forest bare,"
15732,PART II,Lest aught unholy loiter there.'
15733,PART II,
15734,PART II,"Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the while,"
15735,PART II,Half-listening heard him with a smile;                             565
15736,PART II,"Then turned to Lady Geraldine,"
15737,PART II,His eyes made up of wonder and love;
15738,PART II,"And said in courtly accents fine,"
15739,PART II,"'Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous dove,"
15740,PART II,"With arms more strong than harp or song,                           570"
15741,PART II,Thy sire and I will crush the snake!'
15742,PART II,"He kissed her forehead as he spake,"
15743,PART II,And Geraldine in maiden wise
15744,PART II,"Casting down her large bright eyes,"
15745,PART II,With blushing cheek and courtesy fine                              575
15746,PART II,She turned her from Sir Leoline;
15747,PART II,"Softly gathering up her train,"
15748,PART II,That o'er her right arm fell again;
15749,PART II,"And folded her arms across her chest,"
15750,PART II,"And couched her head upon her breast,                              580"
15751,PART II,And looked askance at Christabel--
15752,PART II,"Jesu, Maria, shield her well!"
15753,PART II,
15754,PART II,A snake's small eye blinks dull and shy;
15755,PART II,"And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head,"
15756,PART II,"Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye,                                 585"
15757,PART II,"And with somewhat of malice, and more of dread,"
15758,PART II,At Christabel she looked askance!--
15759,PART II,One moment--and the sight was fled!
15760,PART II,But Christabel in dizzy trance
15761,PART II,Stumbling on the unsteady ground                                   590
15762,PART II,"Shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound;"
15763,PART II,"And Geraldine again turned round,"
15764,PART II,"And like a thing, that sought relief,"
15765,PART II,"Full of wonder and full of grief,"
15766,PART II,She rolled her large bright eyes divine                            595
15767,PART II,Wildly on Sir Leoline.
15768,PART II,
15769,PART II,"The maid, alas! her thoughts are gone,"
15770,PART II,She nothing sees--no sight but one!
15771,PART II,"The maid, devoid of guile and sin,"
15772,PART II,"I know not how, in fearful wise,                                   600"
15773,PART II,So deeply had she drunken in
15774,PART II,"That look, those shrunken serpent eyes,"
15775,PART II,That all her features were resigned
15776,PART II,To this sole image in her mind:
15777,PART II,And passively did imitate                                          605
15778,PART II,That look of dull and treacherous hate!
15779,PART II,"And thus she stood, in dizzy trance,"
15780,PART II,Still picturing that look askance
15781,PART II,With forced unconscious sympathy
15782,PART II,Full before her father's view----                                  610
15783,PART II,As far as such a look could be
15784,PART II,In eyes so innocent and blue!
15785,PART II,
15786,PART II,"And when the trance was o'er, the maid"
15787,PART II,"Paused awhile, and inly prayed:"
15788,PART II,"Then falling at the Baron's feet,                                  615"
15789,PART II,'By my mother's soul do I entreat
15790,PART II,That thou this woman send away!'
15791,PART II,She said: and more she could not say:
15792,PART II,"For what she knew she could not tell,"
15793,PART II,O'er-mastered by the mighty spell.                                 620
15794,PART II,
15795,PART II,"Why is thy cheek so wan and wild,"
15796,PART II,Sir Leoline? Thy only child
15797,PART II,"Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride,"
15798,PART II,"So fair, so innocent, so mild;"
15799,PART II,"The same, for whom thy lady died!                                  625"
15800,PART II,O by the pangs of her dear mother
15801,PART II,Think thou no evil of thy child!
15802,PART II,"For her, and thee, and for no other,"
15803,PART II,She prayed the moment ere she died:
15804,PART II,"Prayed that the babe for whom she died,                            630"
15805,PART II,Might prove her dear lord's joy and pride!
15806,PART II,"That prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,"
15807,PART II,Sir Leoline!
15808,PART II,"And wouldst thou wrong thy only child,"
15809,PART II,Her child and thine?                                       635
15810,PART II,
15811,PART II,Within the Baron's heart and brain
15812,PART II,"If thoughts, like these, had any share,"
15813,PART II,"They only swelled his rage and pain,"
15814,PART II,And did but work confusion there.
15815,PART II,"His heart was cleft with pain and rage,                            640"
15816,PART II,"His cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild,"
15817,PART II,Dishonoured thus in his old age;
15818,PART II,"Dishonoured by his only child,"
15819,PART II,And all his hospitality
15820,PART II,To the wronged daughter of his friend                              645
15821,PART II,By more than woman's jealousy
15822,PART II,Brought thus to a disgraceful end--
15823,PART II,He rolled his eye with stern regard
15824,PART II,"Upon the gentle minstrel bard,"
15825,PART II,"And said in tones abrupt, austere--                                650"
15826,PART II,"'Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here?"
15827,PART II,I bade thee hence!' The bard obeyed;
15828,PART II,"And turning from his own sweet maid,"
15829,PART II,"The agéd knight, Sir Leoline,"
15830,PART II,Led forth the lady Geraldine!                                      655

16622,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],
16623,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"The Frost performs its secret ministry,"
16624,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Unhelped by any wind. The owlet's cry
16625,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Came loud--and hark, again! loud as before."
16626,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"The inmates of my cottage, all at rest,"
16627,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Have left me to that solitude, which suits                           5"
16628,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Abstruser musings: save that at my side
16629,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],My cradled infant slumbers peacefully.
16630,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],'Tis calm indeed! so calm that it disturbs
16631,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],And vexes meditation with its strange
16632,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"And extreme silentness. Sea, hill, and wood,                        10"
16633,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"This populous village! Sea, and hill, and wood,"
16634,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"With all the numberless goings-on of life,"
16635,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Inaudible as dreams! the thin blue flame
16636,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Lies on my low-burnt fire, and quivers not;"
16637,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Only that film,[240:2] which fluttered on the grate,                15"
16638,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Still flutters there, the sole unquiet thing."
16639,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Methinks, its motion in this hush of nature"
16640,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Gives it dim sympathies with me who live,"
16641,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Making it a companionable form,"
16642,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Whose puny flaps and freaks the idling Spirit                       20
16643,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"By its own moods interprets, every where"
16644,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Echo or mirror seeking of itself,"
16645,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],And makes a toy of Thought.
16646,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"But O! how oft,"
16647,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"How oft, at school, with most believing mind,"
16648,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Presageful, have I gazed upon the bars,                             25"
16649,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],To watch that fluttering _stranger_! and as oft
16650,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"With unclosed lids, already had I dreamt"
16651,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Of my sweet birth-place, and the old church-tower,"
16652,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Whose bells, the poor man's only music, rang"
16653,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"From morn to evening, all the hot Fair-day,                         30"
16654,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"So sweetly, that they stirred and haunted me"
16655,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"With a wild pleasure, falling on mine ear"
16656,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Most like articulate sounds of things to come!
16657,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"So gazed I, till the soothing things, I dreamt,"
16658,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Lulled me to sleep, and sleep prolonged my dreams!                  35"
16659,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"And so I brooded all the following morn,"
16660,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Awed by the stern preceptor's face, mine eye"
16661,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Fixed with mock study on my swimming book:
16662,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Save if the door half opened, and I snatched"
16663,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"A hasty glance, and still my heart leaped up,                       40"
16664,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"For still I hoped to see the _stranger's_ face,"
16665,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Townsman, or aunt, or sister more beloved,"
16666,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],My play-mate when we both were clothed alike!
16667,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],
16668,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Dear Babe, that sleepest cradled by my side,"
16669,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Whose gentle breathings, heard in this deep calm,                   45"
16670,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Fill up the intersperséd vacancies
16671,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],And momentary pauses of the thought!
16672,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],My babe so beautiful! it thrills my heart
16673,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"With tender gladness, thus to look at thee,"
16674,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"And think that thou shalt learn far other lore,                     50"
16675,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],And in far other scenes! For I was reared
16676,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"In the great city, pent 'mid cloisters dim,"
16677,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],And saw nought lovely but the sky and stars.
16678,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"But _thou_, my babe! shalt wander like a breeze"
16679,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"By lakes and sandy shores, beneath the crags                        55"
16680,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Of ancient mountain, and beneath the clouds,"
16681,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Which image in their bulk both lakes and shores
16682,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],And mountain crags: so shalt thou see and hear
16683,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],The lovely shapes and sounds intelligible
16684,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Of that eternal language, which thy God                             60"
16685,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Utters, who from eternity doth teach"
16686,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Himself in all, and all things in himself."
16687,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Great universal Teacher! he shall mould
16688,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Thy spirit, and by giving make it ask."
16689,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],
16690,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee,                     65"
16691,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Whether the summer clothe the general earth
16692,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"With greenness, or the redbreast sit and sing"
16693,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch
16694,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Of mossy apple-tree, while the nigh thatch"
16695,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],Smokes in the sun-thaw; whether the eave-drops fall                 70
16696,FROST AT MIDNIGHT[240:1],"Heard only in the trances of the blast,"

16938,ORIGINAL POETRY.,
16939,ORIGINAL POETRY.,The following excellent Ode will be in unison with the feelings of every
16940,ORIGINAL POETRY.,"friend to Liberty and foe to Oppression; of all who, admiring the French"
16941,ORIGINAL POETRY.,"Revolution, detest and deplore the conduct of France towards"
16942,ORIGINAL POETRY.,Switzerland. It is very satisfactory to find so zealous and steady an
16943,ORIGINAL POETRY.,advocate for Freedom as Mr. COLERIDGE concur with us in condemning the
16944,ORIGINAL POETRY.,conduct of France towards the Swiss Cantons. Indeed his concurrence is
16945,ORIGINAL POETRY.,not singular; we know of no Friend to Liberty who is not of his opinion.
16946,ORIGINAL POETRY.,"What we most admire is the _avowal_ of his sentiments, and public"
16947,ORIGINAL POETRY.,censure of the unprincipled and atrocious conduct of France. The Poem
16948,ORIGINAL POETRY.,"itself is written with great energy. The second, third, and fourth"
16949,ORIGINAL POETRY.,stanzas contain some of the most vigorous lines we have ever read. The
16950,ORIGINAL POETRY.,lines in the fourth stanza:--
16951,ORIGINAL POETRY.,

16960,ORIGINAL POETRY.,The following ODE was first published in this paper (in the beginning of
16961,ORIGINAL POETRY.,the year 1798) in a less perfect state. The present state of France and
16962,ORIGINAL POETRY.,Switzerland give it so peculiar an interest at the present time that we

16968,ARGUMENT.,'_First Stanza._ An invocation to those objects in Nature the
16969,ARGUMENT.,contemplation of which had inspired the Poet with a devotional love of
16970,ARGUMENT.,Liberty. _Second Stanza._ The exultation of the Poet at the commencement
16971,ARGUMENT.,"of the French Revolution, and his unqualified abhorrence of the Alliance"
16972,ARGUMENT.,against the Republic. _Third Stanza._ The blasphemies and horrors during
16973,ARGUMENT.,the domination of the Terrorists regarded by the Poet as a transient
16974,ARGUMENT.,"storm, and as the natural consequence of the former despotism and of the"
16975,ARGUMENT.,"foul superstition of Popery. Reason, indeed, began to suggest many"
16976,ARGUMENT.,apprehensions; yet still the Poet struggled to retain the hope that
16977,ARGUMENT.,France would make conquests by no other means than by presenting to the
16978,ARGUMENT.,observation of Europe a people more happy and better instructed than
16979,ARGUMENT.,"under other forms of Government. _Fourth Stanza._ Switzerland, and the"
16980,ARGUMENT.,"Poet's recantation. _Fifth Stanza._ An address to Liberty, in which the"
16981,ARGUMENT.,Poet expresses his conviction that those feelings and that grand _ideal_
16982,ARGUMENT.,of Freedom which the mind attains by its contemplation of its individual
16983,ARGUMENT.,"nature, and of the sublime surrounding objects (see Stanza the First) do"
16984,ARGUMENT.,"not belong to men, as a society, nor can possibly be either gratified or"
16985,ARGUMENT.,"realised, under any form of human government; but belong to the"
16986,ARGUMENT.,"individual man, so far as he is pure, and inflamed with the love and"
16987,ARGUMENT.,adoration of God in Nature.'

17152,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],It was my own sole thought in solitude.
17153,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],I told it to the Saints amid my hymns--

17165,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Her thoughts were wild, her soul was in her eye,"

17167,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"And she had made a song about the wars,"
17168,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],And sang it to the sun and to the stars!
17169,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"But while she look'd and listen'd, stood and ran,"
17170,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"And saw him plain in every distant man,"

17173,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"A wounded man, who met us in the wood,"
17174,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Heavily ask'd her where _my_ cottage stood,"
17175,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],And told us all: she cast her eyes around
17176,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],As if his words had been but empty sound.                           70
17177,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Then look'd to Heav'n, like one that would deny"
17178,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],That such a thing _could be_ beneath the sky.
17179,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"_Again_ he ask'd her if she knew my name,"
17180,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"And instantly an anguish wrench'd her frame,"
17181,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],And left her mind imperfect. No delight                             75
17182,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Thenceforth she found in any cheerful sight,"

17184,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Scenes of past joy, and birth-place of her loves."
17185,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"If to her spirit any sound was dear,"
17186,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],'Twas the deep moan that spoke the tempest near;                    80

17188,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Sent from the dark, imprison'd floods beneath."
17189,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"She wander'd up the crag and down the slope,"
17190,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"But not, as in her happy days of hope,"
17191,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"To seek the churning-plant of sovereign power,                      85"
17192,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],That grew in clefts and bore a scarlet flower!

17204,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"For thither oft would my poor child repair,"
17205,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],To ease her soul by penitence and prayer.
17206,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],I knew that peace at good men's prayers returns
17207,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Home to the contrite heart of him that mourns,                     100"
17208,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],And check'd her not; and often there she found
17209,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],A timely pallet when the evening frown'd.
17210,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],And there I trusted that my child would light

17213,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],And she was absent. To my rest I went:
17214,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"I thought her safe, yet often did I wake"
17215,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],And felt my very heart within me ache.
17216,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"No daughter near me, at this very door,"
17217,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],Next morn I listen'd to the dying roar.                            110
17218,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Above, below, the prowling vulture wail'd,"
17219,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],And down the cliffs the heavy vapour sail'd.
17220,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Up by the wide-spread waves in fury torn,"
17221,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],Homestalls and pines along the vale were borne.

17228,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"To find some out-stretch'd man--perchance to save,"
17229,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Or give, at least, that last good gift, a grave!"
17230,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"But now a gathering crowd did I survey,"
17231,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],That slowly up the pasture bent their way;
17232,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],Nor could I doubt but that their care had found                    125
17233,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],Some pilgrim in th' unchannel'd torrent drown'd.
17234,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],And down the lawn I hasten'd to implore
17235,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],That they would bring the body to my door;
17236,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"But soon exclaim'd a boy, who ran before,"
17237,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"'Thrown by the last night's waters from their bed,                 130"
17238,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Your daughter has been found, and she is dead!'"
17239,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],
17240,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"The old man paused--May he who, sternly just,"
17241,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],Lays at his will his creatures in the dust;
17242,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"Some ere the earliest buds of hope be blown,"
17243,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],"And some, when every bloom of joy is flown;                        135"
17244,THE OLD MAN OF THE ALPS[248:1],May he the parent to his child restore

17976,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","A balmy night! and though the stars be dim,"
17977,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",Yet let us think upon the vernal showers
17978,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","That gladden the green earth, and we shall find                     10"
17979,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",A pleasure in the dimness of the stars.
17980,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","And hark! the Nightingale begins its song,"
17981,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","'Most musical, most melancholy' bird![264:2]"
17982,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",A melancholy bird? Oh! idle thought!
17983,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",In Nature there is nothing melancholy.                              15
17984,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",But some night-wandering man whose heart was pierced
17985,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","With the remembrance of a grievous wrong,"
17986,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","Or slow distemper, or neglected love,"

17990,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",First named these notes a melancholy strain.
17991,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",And many a poet echoes the conceit;

17994,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","Beside a brook in mossy forest-dell,"
17995,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","By sun or moon-light, to the influxes"
17996,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",Of shapes and sounds and shifting elements

18015,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",As he were fearful that an April night
18016,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",Would be too short for him to utter forth
18017,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","His love-chant, and disburthen his full soul"

18020,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",And I know a grove
18021,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","Of large extent, hard by a castle huge,                             50"
18022,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",Which the great lord inhabits not; and so
18023,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","This grove is wild with tangling underwood,"
18024,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","And the trim walks are broken up, and grass,"
18025,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",Thin grass and king-cups grow within the paths.
18026,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",But never elsewhere in one place I knew                             55

18032,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",And one low piping sound more sweet than all--
18033,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","Stirring the air with such a harmony,"
18034,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798","That should you close your eyes, you might almost"

18054,"A CONVERSATION POEM, APRIL, 1798",As if some sudden gale had swept at once

18149,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"'The Author has published the following humble fragment,"
18150,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,encouraged by the decisive recommendation of more than one of
18151,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,our most celebrated living Poets. The language was intended to
18152,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"be dramatic; that is, suited to the narrator; and the metre"
18153,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,corresponds to the homeliness of the diction. It is therefore
18154,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"presented as the fragment, not of a Poem, but of a common"
18155,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,Ballad-tale.[268:1] Whether this is sufficient to justify the
18156,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"adoption of such a style, in any metrical composition not"
18157,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"professedly ludicrous, the Author is himself in some doubt. At"
18158,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"all events, it is not presented as poetry, and it is in no way"
18159,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,connected with the Author's judgment concerning poetic
18160,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"diction. Its merits, if any, are exclusively psychological."
18161,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,The story which must be supposed to have been narrated in the
18162,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,first and second parts is as follows:--
18163,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,
18164,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"'Edward, a young farmer, meets at the house of Ellen her"
18165,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"bosom-friend Mary, and commences an acquaintance, which ends"
18166,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"in a mutual attachment. With her consent, and by the advice of"
18167,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"their common friend Ellen, he announces his hopes and"
18168,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"intentions to Mary's mother, a widow-woman bordering on her"
18169,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"fortieth year, and from constant health, the possession of a"
18170,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"competent property, and from having had no other children but"
18171,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"Mary and another daughter (the father died in their infancy),"
18172,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,retaining for the greater part her personal attractions and
18173,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,comeliness of appearance; but a woman of low education and
18174,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,violent temper. The answer which she at once returned to
18175,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"Edward's application was remarkable--""Well, Edward! you are a"
18176,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"handsome young fellow, and you shall have my daughter."" From"
18177,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"this time all their wooing passed under the mother's eye; and,"
18178,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"in fine, she became herself enamoured of her future"
18179,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"son-in-law, and practised every art, both of endearment and of"
18180,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"calumny, to transfer his affections from her daughter to"
18181,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"herself. (The outlines of the Tale are positive facts, and of"
18182,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"no very distant date, though the author has purposely altered"
18183,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"the names and the scene of action, as well as invented the"
18184,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,characters of the parties and the detail of the incidents.)
18185,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"Edward, however, though perplexed by her strange detractions"
18186,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"from her daughter's good qualities, yet in the innocence of"
18187,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,his own heart still mistook[268:2] her increasing fondness for
18188,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"motherly affection; she at length, overcome by her miserable"
18189,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"passion, after much abuse of Mary's temper and moral"
18190,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"tendencies, exclaimed with violent emotion--""O Edward! indeed,"
18191,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"indeed, she is not fit for you--she has not a heart to love"
18192,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"you as you deserve. It is I that love you! Marry me, Edward!"
18193,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"and I will this very day settle all my property on you."" The"
18194,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"Lover's eyes were now opened; and thus taken by surprise,"
18195,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"whether from the effect of the horror which he felt, acting as"
18196,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"it were hysterically on his nervous system, or that at the"
18197,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,first moment he lost the sense of the guilt of the proposal in
18198,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"the feeling of its strangeness and absurdity, he flung her"
18199,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,from him and burst into a fit of laughter. Irritated by this
18200,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"almost to frenzy, the woman fell on her knees, and in a loud"
18201,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"voice that approached to a scream, she prayed for a curse both"
18202,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,on him and on her own child. Mary happened to be in the room
18203,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"directly above them, heard Edward's laugh, and her mother's"
18204,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"blasphemous prayer, and fainted away. He, hearing the fall,"
18205,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"ran upstairs, and taking her in his arms, carried her off to"
18206,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,Ellen's home; and after some fruitless attempts on her part
18207,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,"toward a reconciliation with her mother, she was married to"
18208,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,him.--And here the third part of the Tale begins.

18210,A FRAGMENT OF A SEXTON'S TALE,'I was not led to choose this story from any partiality to

18470,[PART II--FROM MS.][271:3],For with a smile she cried:
18471,[PART II--FROM MS.][271:3],"'Unblest ye shall not pass my door,"
18472,[PART II--FROM MS.][271:3],The bride-groom and his bride.

18474,[PART II--FROM MS.][271:3],"'Be blithe as lambs in April are,"

18476,[PART II--FROM MS.][271:3],May God forbid that thought of me

18490,[PART II--FROM MS.][271:3],"She rent her hoary hair,"
18491,[PART II--FROM MS.][271:3],And foamed like any Dog of June

18527,PART III[276:1],
18528,PART III[276:1],The grapes upon the Vicar's wall                                   220
18529,PART III[276:1],Were ripe as ripe could be;
18530,PART III[276:1],And yellow leaves in sun and wind
18531,PART III[276:1],Were falling from the tree.
18532,PART III[276:1],
18533,PART III[276:1],On the hedge-elms in the narrow lane
18534,PART III[276:1],Still swung the spikes of corn:                                  225
18535,PART III[276:1],Dear Lord! it seems but yesterday--
18536,PART III[276:1],Young Edward's marriage-morn.
18537,PART III[276:1],
18538,PART III[276:1],"Up through that wood behind the church,"
18539,PART III[276:1],There leads from Edward's door
18540,PART III[276:1],"A mossy track, all over boughed,                                   230"
18541,PART III[276:1],For half a mile or more.
18542,PART III[276:1],
18543,PART III[276:1],And from their house-door by that track
18544,PART III[276:1],The bride and bridegroom went;
18545,PART III[276:1],"Sweet Mary, though she was not gay,"
18546,PART III[276:1],Seemed cheerful and content.                                     235
18547,PART III[276:1],
18548,PART III[276:1],"But when they to the church-yard came,"
18549,PART III[276:1],"I've heard poor Mary say,"
18550,PART III[276:1],"As soon as she stepped into the sun,"
18551,PART III[276:1],Her heart it died away.
18552,PART III[276:1],
18553,PART III[276:1],"And when the Vicar join'd their hands,                             240"
18554,PART III[276:1],Her limbs did creep and freeze:
18555,PART III[276:1],"But when they prayed, she thought she saw"
18556,PART III[276:1],Her mother on her knees.
18557,PART III[276:1],
18558,PART III[276:1],And o'er the church-path they returned--
18559,PART III[276:1],"I saw poor Mary's back,                                          245"
18560,PART III[276:1],Just as she stepped beneath the boughs
18561,PART III[276:1],Into the mossy track.
18562,PART III[276:1],
18563,PART III[276:1],Her feet upon the mossy track
18564,PART III[276:1],The married maiden set:
18565,PART III[276:1],That moment--I have heard her say--                                250
18566,PART III[276:1],She wished she could forget.
18567,PART III[276:1],
18568,PART III[276:1],The shade o'er-flushed her limbs with heat--
18569,PART III[276:1],Then came a chill like death:
18570,PART III[276:1],"And when the merry bells rang out,"
18571,PART III[276:1],They seemed to stop her breath.                                  255
18572,PART III[276:1],
18573,PART III[276:1],Beneath the foulest mother's curse
18574,PART III[276:1],No child could ever thrive:
18575,PART III[276:1],"A mother is a mother still,"
18576,PART III[276:1],The holiest thing alive.
18577,PART III[276:1],
18578,PART III[276:1],So five months passed: the mother still                            260
18579,PART III[276:1],Would never heal the strife;
18580,PART III[276:1],But Edward was a loving man
18581,PART III[276:1],And Mary a fond wife.
18582,PART III[276:1],
18583,PART III[276:1],"'My sister may not visit us,"
18584,PART III[276:1],My mother says her nay:                                          265
18585,PART III[276:1],"O Edward! you are all to me,"
18586,PART III[276:1],I wish for your sake I could be
18587,PART III[276:1],More lifesome and more gay.
18588,PART III[276:1],
18589,PART III[276:1],"'I'm dull and sad! indeed, indeed"
18590,PART III[276:1],I know I have no reason!                                         270
18591,PART III[276:1],"Perhaps I am not well in health,"
18592,PART III[276:1],And 'tis a gloomy season.'
18593,PART III[276:1],
18594,PART III[276:1],"'Twas a drizzly time--no ice, no snow!"
18595,PART III[276:1],And on the few fine days
18596,PART III[276:1],"She stirred not out, lest she might meet                           275"
18597,PART III[276:1],Her mother in the ways.
18598,PART III[276:1],
18599,PART III[276:1],"But Ellen, spite of miry ways"
18600,PART III[276:1],"And weather dark and dreary,"
18601,PART III[276:1],"Trudged every day to Edward's house,"
18602,PART III[276:1],And made them all more cheery.                                   280
18603,PART III[276:1],
18604,PART III[276:1],Oh! Ellen was a faithful friend.
18605,PART III[276:1],More dear than any sister!
18606,PART III[276:1],As cheerful too as singing lark;
18607,PART III[276:1],"And she ne'er left them till 'twas dark,"
18608,PART III[276:1],And then they always missed her.                                 285
18609,PART III[276:1],
18610,PART III[276:1],And now Ash-Wednesday came--that day
18611,PART III[276:1],But few to church repair:
18612,PART III[276:1],For on that day you know we read
18613,PART III[276:1],The Commination prayer.
18614,PART III[276:1],
18615,PART III[276:1],"Our late old Vicar, a kind man,                                    290"
18616,PART III[276:1],"Once, Sir, he said to me,"
18617,PART III[276:1],He wished that service was clean out
18618,PART III[276:1],Of our good Liturgy.
18619,PART III[276:1],
18620,PART III[276:1],The mother walked into the church--
18621,PART III[276:1],To Ellen's seat she went:                                        295
18622,PART III[276:1],Though Ellen always kept her church
18623,PART III[276:1],All church-days during Lent.
18624,PART III[276:1],
18625,PART III[276:1],And gentle Ellen welcomed her
18626,PART III[276:1],With courteous looks and mild:
18627,PART III[276:1],"Thought she, 'What if her heart should melt,                       300"
18628,PART III[276:1],And all be reconciled!'
18629,PART III[276:1],
18630,PART III[276:1],The day was scarcely like a day--
18631,PART III[276:1],The clouds were black outright:
18632,PART III[276:1],"And many a night, with half a moon,"
18633,PART III[276:1],I've seen the church more light.                                 305
18634,PART III[276:1],
18635,PART III[276:1],The wind was wild; against the glass
18636,PART III[276:1],The rain did beat and bicker;
18637,PART III[276:1],"The church-tower swinging over head,"
18638,PART III[276:1],You scarce could hear the Vicar!
18639,PART III[276:1],
18640,PART III[276:1],"And then and there the mother knelt,                               310"
18641,PART III[276:1],And audibly she cried--
18642,PART III[276:1],'Oh! may a clinging curse consume
18643,PART III[276:1],This woman by my side!
18644,PART III[276:1],
18645,PART III[276:1],"'O hear me, hear me, Lord in Heaven."
18646,PART III[276:1],Although you take my life--                                      315
18647,PART III[276:1],"O curse this woman, at whose house"
18648,PART III[276:1],Young Edward woo'd his wife.
18649,PART III[276:1],
18650,PART III[276:1],"'By night and day, in bed and bower,"
18651,PART III[276:1],O let her curséd be!!!'
18652,PART III[276:1],"So having prayed, steady and slow,                                 320"
18653,PART III[276:1],She rose up from her knee!
18654,PART III[276:1],"And left the church, nor e'er again"
18655,PART III[276:1],The church-door entered she.
18656,PART III[276:1],
18657,PART III[276:1],"I saw poor Ellen kneeling still,"
18658,PART III[276:1],So pale! I guessed not why:                                      325
18659,PART III[276:1],"When she stood up, there plainly was"
18660,PART III[276:1],A trouble in her eye.
18661,PART III[276:1],
18662,PART III[276:1],"And when the prayers were done, we all"
18663,PART III[276:1],Came round and asked her why:
18664,PART III[276:1],"Giddy she seemed, and sure, there was                              330"
18665,PART III[276:1],A trouble in her eye.
18666,PART III[276:1],
18667,PART III[276:1],But ere she from the church-door stepped
18668,PART III[276:1],She smiled and told us why:
18669,PART III[276:1],"'It was a wicked woman's curse,'"
18670,PART III[276:1],"Quoth she, 'and what care I?'                                    335"
18671,PART III[276:1],
18672,PART III[276:1],"She smiled, and smiled, and passed it off"
18673,PART III[276:1],Ere from the door she stept--
18674,PART III[276:1],But all agree it would have been
18675,PART III[276:1],Much better had she wept.
18676,PART III[276:1],
18677,PART III[276:1],"And if her heart was not at ease,                                  340"
18678,PART III[276:1],This was her constant cry--
18679,PART III[276:1],'It was a wicked woman's curse--
18680,PART III[276:1],"God's good, and what care I?'"
18681,PART III[276:1],
18682,PART III[276:1],"There was a hurry in her looks,"
18683,PART III[276:1],Her struggles she redoubled:                                     345
18684,PART III[276:1],"'It was a wicked woman's curse,"
18685,PART III[276:1],And why should I be troubled?'
18686,PART III[276:1],
18687,PART III[276:1],These tears will come--I dandled her
18688,PART III[276:1],When 'twas the merest fairy--
18689,PART III[276:1],Good creature! and she hid it all:                                 350
18690,PART III[276:1],She told it not to Mary.
18691,PART III[276:1],
18692,PART III[276:1],But Mary heard the tale: her arms
18693,PART III[276:1],Round Ellen's neck she threw;
18694,PART III[276:1],"'O Ellen, Ellen, she cursed me,"
18695,PART III[276:1],And now she hath cursed you!'                                    355
18696,PART III[276:1],
18697,PART III[276:1],I saw young Edward by himself
18698,PART III[276:1],"Stalk fast adown the lee,"
18699,PART III[276:1],"He snatched a stick from every fence,"
18700,PART III[276:1],A twig from every tree.
18701,PART III[276:1],
18702,PART III[276:1],"He snapped them still with hand or knee,                           360"
18703,PART III[276:1],And then away they flew!
18704,PART III[276:1],As if with his uneasy limbs
18705,PART III[276:1],He knew not what to do!
18706,PART III[276:1],
18707,PART III[276:1],"You see, good sir! that single hill?"
18708,PART III[276:1],His farm lies underneath:                                        365
18709,PART III[276:1],"He heard it there, he heard it all,"
18710,PART III[276:1],And only gnashed his teeth.
18711,PART III[276:1],
18712,PART III[276:1],Now Ellen was a darling love
18713,PART III[276:1],In all his joys and cares:
18714,PART III[276:1],And Ellen's name and Mary's name                                   370
18715,PART III[276:1],"Fast-linked they both together came,"
18716,PART III[276:1],Whene'er he said his prayers.
18717,PART III[276:1],
18718,PART III[276:1],And in the moment of his prayers
18719,PART III[276:1],He loved them both alike:
18720,PART III[276:1],"Yea, both sweet names with one sweet joy                           375"
18721,PART III[276:1],Upon his heart did strike!
18722,PART III[276:1],
18723,PART III[276:1],"He reach'd his home, and by his looks"
18724,PART III[276:1],They saw his inward strife:
18725,PART III[276:1],"And they clung round him with their arms,"
18726,PART III[276:1],Both Ellen and his wife.                                         380
18727,PART III[276:1],

18729,PART III[276:1],So on his breast she bowed;
18730,PART III[276:1],"Then frenzy melted into grief,"
18731,PART III[276:1],And Edward wept aloud.

18741,PART IV,To see a man tread over graves
18742,PART IV,I hold it no good mark;                                          390
18743,PART IV,"'Tis wicked in the sun and moon,"
18744,PART IV,And bad luck in the dark!
18745,PART IV,
18746,PART IV,"You see that grave? The Lord he gives,"
18747,PART IV,"The Lord, he takes away:"
18748,PART IV,O Sir! the child of my old age                                     395
18749,PART IV,Lies there as cold as clay.
18750,PART IV,
18751,PART IV,"Except that grave, you scarce see one"
18752,PART IV,That was not dug by me;
18753,PART IV,I'd rather dance upon 'em all
18754,PART IV,Than tread upon these three!                                     400
18755,PART IV,
18756,PART IV,"'Aye, Sexton! 'tis a touching tale.'"
18757,PART IV,"You, Sir! are but a lad;"
18758,PART IV,"This month I'm in my seventieth year,"
18759,PART IV,And still it makes me sad.
18760,PART IV,
18761,PART IV,"And Mary's sister told it me,                                      405"
18762,PART IV,For three good hours and more;
18763,PART IV,"Though I had heard it, in the main,"
18764,PART IV,"From Edward's self, before."
18765,PART IV,
18766,PART IV,Well! it passed off! the gentle Ellen
18767,PART IV,Did well nigh dote on Mary;                                      410
18768,PART IV,"And she went oftener than before,"
18769,PART IV,And Mary loved her more and more:
18770,PART IV,She managed all the dairy.
18771,PART IV,
18772,PART IV,"To market she on market-days,"
18773,PART IV,To church on Sundays came;                                       415
18774,PART IV,"All seemed the same: all seemed so, Sir!"
18775,PART IV,But all was not the same!
18776,PART IV,
18777,PART IV,Had Ellen lost her mirth? Oh! no!
18778,PART IV,But she was seldom cheerful;
18779,PART IV,And Edward looked as if he thought                                 420
18780,PART IV,That Ellen's mirth was fearful.
18781,PART IV,
18782,PART IV,"When by herself, she to herself"
18783,PART IV,Must sing some merry rhyme;
18784,PART IV,"She could not now be glad for hours,"
18785,PART IV,Yet silent all the time.                                         425
18786,PART IV,
18787,PART IV,"And when she soothed her friend, through all"
18788,PART IV,Her soothing words 'twas plain
18789,PART IV,"She had a sore grief of her own,"
18790,PART IV,A haunting in her brain.
18791,PART IV,
18792,PART IV,"And oft she said, I'm not grown thin!                              430"
18793,PART IV,And then her wrist she spanned;
18794,PART IV,"And once when Mary was down-cast,"
18795,PART IV,"She took her by the hand,"
18796,PART IV,"And gazed upon her, and at first"
18797,PART IV,She gently pressed her hand;                                     435
18798,PART IV,
18799,PART IV,"Then harder, till her grasp at length"
18800,PART IV,Did gripe like a convulsion!
18801,PART IV,"'Alas!' said she, 'we ne'er can be"
18802,PART IV,Made happy by compulsion!'
18803,PART IV,
18804,PART IV,And once her both arms suddenly                                    440
18805,PART IV,"Round Mary's neck she flung,"
18806,PART IV,"And her heart panted, and she felt"
18807,PART IV,The words upon her tongue.
18808,PART IV,
18809,PART IV,"She felt them coming, but no power"
18810,PART IV,Had she the words to smother:                                    445
18811,PART IV,"And with a kind of shriek she cried,"
18812,PART IV,'Oh Christ! you're like your mother!'
18813,PART IV,
18814,PART IV,So gentle Ellen now no more
18815,PART IV,Could make this sad house cheery;
18816,PART IV,And Mary's melancholy ways                                         450
18817,PART IV,Drove Edward wild and weary.
18818,PART IV,
18819,PART IV,"Lingering he raised his latch at eve,"
18820,PART IV,Though tired in heart and limb:
18821,PART IV,"He loved no other place, and yet"
18822,PART IV,Home was no home to him.                                         455
18823,PART IV,
18824,PART IV,"One evening he took up a book,"
18825,PART IV,And nothing in it read;
18826,PART IV,"Then flung it down, and groaning cried,"
18827,PART IV,'O! Heaven! that I were dead.'
18828,PART IV,
18829,PART IV,"Mary looked up into his face,                                      460"
18830,PART IV,And nothing to him said;
18831,PART IV,"She tried to smile, and on his arm"
18832,PART IV,Mournfully leaned her head.
18833,PART IV,
18834,PART IV,"And he burst into tears, and fell"
18835,PART IV,Upon his knees in prayer:                                        465
18836,PART IV,"'Her heart is broke! O God! my grief,"

18839,PART IV,'Twas such a foggy time as makes

19075,PREFATORY NOTE,"A prose composition, one not in metre at least, seems _primâ facie_ to"
19076,PREFATORY NOTE,"require explanation or apology. It was written in the year 1798, near"
19077,PREFATORY NOTE,"Nether Stowey, in Somersetshire, at which place (_sanctum et amabile"
19078,PREFATORY NOTE,nomen!_ rich by so many associations and recollections) the author had
19079,PREFATORY NOTE,taken up his residence in order to enjoy the society and close
19080,PREFATORY NOTE,"neighbourhood of a dear and honoured friend, T. Poole, Esq. The work was"
19081,PREFATORY NOTE,"to have been written in concert with another [Wordsworth], whose name is"
19082,PREFATORY NOTE,too venerable within the precincts of genius to be unnecessarily brought
19083,PREFATORY NOTE,"into connection with such a trifle, and who was then residing at a small"
19084,PREFATORY NOTE,distance from Nether Stowey. The title and subject were suggested by
19085,PREFATORY NOTE,"myself, who likewise drew out the scheme and the contents for each of"
19086,PREFATORY NOTE,"the three books or cantos, of which the work was to consist, and which,"
19087,PREFATORY NOTE,"the reader is to be informed, was to have been finished in one night! My"
19088,PREFATORY NOTE,partner undertook the first canto: I the second: and which ever had
19089,PREFATORY NOTE,"_done first_, was to set about the third. Almost thirty years have"
19090,PREFATORY NOTE,passed by; yet at this moment I cannot without something more than a
19091,PREFATORY NOTE,smile moot the question which of the two things was the more
19092,PREFATORY NOTE,"impracticable, for a mind so eminently original to compose another man's"
19093,PREFATORY NOTE,"thoughts and fancies, or for a taste so austerely pure and simple to"
19094,PREFATORY NOTE,imitate the Death of Abel? Methinks I see his grand and noble
19095,PREFATORY NOTE,countenance as at the moment when having despatched my own portion of
19096,PREFATORY NOTE,"the task at full finger-speed, I hastened to him with my"
19097,PREFATORY NOTE,manuscript--that look of humourous despondency fixed on his almost blank
19098,PREFATORY NOTE,"sheet of paper, and then its silent mock-piteous admission of failure"
19099,PREFATORY NOTE,struggling with the sense of the exceeding ridiculousness of the whole
19100,PREFATORY NOTE,scheme--which broke up in a laugh: and the Ancient Mariner was written
19101,PREFATORY NOTE,instead.
19102,PREFATORY NOTE,
19103,PREFATORY NOTE,"Years afterward, however, the draft of the plan and proposed incidents,"
19104,PREFATORY NOTE,"and the portion executed, obtained favour in the eyes of more than one"
19105,PREFATORY NOTE,"person, whose judgment on a poetic work could not but have weighed with"
19106,PREFATORY NOTE,"me, even though no parental partiality had been thrown into the same"
19107,PREFATORY NOTE,"scale, as a make-weight: and I determined on commencing anew, and"
19108,PREFATORY NOTE,"composing the whole in stanzas, and made some progress in realising this"
19109,PREFATORY NOTE,"intention, when adverse gales drove my bark off the 'Fortunate Isles' of"
19110,PREFATORY NOTE,the Muses: and then other and more momentous interests prompted a
19111,PREFATORY NOTE,"different voyage, to firmer anchorage and a securer port. I have in vain"
19112,PREFATORY NOTE,tried to recover the lines from the palimpsest tablet of my memory: and
19113,PREFATORY NOTE,"I can only offer the introductory stanza, which had been committed to"
19114,PREFATORY NOTE,"writing for the purpose of procuring a friend's judgment on the metre,"
19115,PREFATORY NOTE,as a specimen:--
19116,PREFATORY NOTE,
19117,PREFATORY NOTE,"Encinctured with a twine of leaves,"
19118,PREFATORY NOTE,That leafy twine his only dress!
19119,PREFATORY NOTE,"A lovely Boy was plucking fruits,"
19120,PREFATORY NOTE,"By moonlight, in a wilderness."
19121,PREFATORY NOTE,"(In a moonlight wilderness  _Aids to Reflection, 1825_.)"
19122,PREFATORY NOTE,"The moon was bright, the air was free,"
19123,PREFATORY NOTE,And fruits and flowers together grew
19124,PREFATORY NOTE,On many a shrub and many a tree:
19125,PREFATORY NOTE,"And all put on a gentle hue,"
19126,PREFATORY NOTE,Hanging in the shadowy air
19127,PREFATORY NOTE,Like a picture rich and rare.
19128,PREFATORY NOTE,"It was a climate where, they say,"
19129,PREFATORY NOTE,The night is more belov'd than day.
19130,PREFATORY NOTE,"But who that beauteous Boy beguil'd,"
19131,PREFATORY NOTE,That beauteous Boy to linger here?
19132,PREFATORY NOTE,"Alone, by night, a little child,"
19133,PREFATORY NOTE,In place so silent and so wild--
19134,PREFATORY NOTE,"Has he no friend, no loving mother near?"
19135,PREFATORY NOTE,
19136,PREFATORY NOTE,"I have here given the birth, parentage, and premature decease of the"
19137,PREFATORY NOTE,"'Wanderings of Cain, a poem',--intreating, however, my Readers, not to"
19138,PREFATORY NOTE,think so meanly of my judgment as to suppose that I either regard or
19139,PREFATORY NOTE,offer it as any excuse for the publication of the following fragment
19140,PREFATORY NOTE,"(and I may add, of one or two others in its neighbourhood) in its"
19141,PREFATORY NOTE,primitive crudity. But I should find still greater difficulty in
19142,PREFATORY NOTE,forgiving myself were I to record pro _taedio_ publico a set of petty
19143,PREFATORY NOTE,mishaps and annoyances which I myself wish to forget. I must be content
19144,PREFATORY NOTE,"therefore with assuring the friendly Reader, that the less he attributes"
19145,PREFATORY NOTE,"its appearance to the Author's will, choice, or judgment, the nearer to"
19146,PREFATORY NOTE,the truth he will be.

19155,CANTO II,
19156,CANTO II,"'A little further, O my father, yet a little further, and"
19157,CANTO II,we shall come into the open moonlight.' Their road was
19158,CANTO II,through a forest of fir-trees; at its entrance the trees stood
19159,CANTO II,"at distances from each other, and the path was broad, and"
19160,CANTO II,"the moonlight and the moonlight shadows reposed upon it,             5"
19161,CANTO II,and appeared quietly to inhabit that solitude. But soon the
19162,CANTO II,path winded and became narrow; the sun at high noon
19163,CANTO II,"sometimes speckled, but never illumined it, and now it was"
19164,CANTO II,dark as a cavern.
19165,CANTO II,
19166,CANTO II,"'It is dark, O my father!' said Enos, 'but the path under           10"
19167,CANTO II,"our feet is smooth and soft, and we shall soon come out into"
19168,CANTO II,the open moonlight.'
19169,CANTO II,
19170,CANTO II,"'Lead on, my child!' said Cain; 'guide me, little child!'"
19171,CANTO II,And the innocent little child clasped a finger of the hand
19172,CANTO II,"which had murdered the righteous Abel, and he guided his            15"
19173,CANTO II,"father. 'The fir branches drip upon thee, my son.' 'Yea,"
19174,CANTO II,"pleasantly, father, for I ran fast and eagerly to bring thee"
19175,CANTO II,"the pitcher and the cake, and my body is not yet cool. How"
19176,CANTO II,happy the squirrels are that feed on these fir-trees! they leap
19177,CANTO II,"from bough to bough, and the old squirrels play round their         20"
19178,CANTO II,"young ones in the nest. I clomb a tree yesterday at noon,"
19179,CANTO II,"O my father, that I might play with them, but they leaped"
19180,CANTO II,"away from the branches, even to the slender twigs did they"
19181,CANTO II,"leap, and in a moment I beheld them on another tree. Why,"
19182,CANTO II,"O my father, would they not play with me? I would be good           25"
19183,CANTO II,to them as thou art good to me: and I groaned to them
19184,CANTO II,"even as thou groanest when thou givest me to eat, and when"
19185,CANTO II,"thou coverest me at evening, and as often as I stand at thy"
19186,CANTO II,"knee and thine eyes look at me?' Then Cain stopped, and"
19187,CANTO II,"stifling his groans he sank to the earth, and the child Enos        30"
19188,CANTO II,stood in the darkness beside him.
19189,CANTO II,
19190,CANTO II,"And Cain lifted up his voice and cried bitterly, and said,"
19191,CANTO II,'The Mighty One that persecuteth me is on this side and on
19192,CANTO II,"that; he pursueth my soul like the wind, like the sand-blast"
19193,CANTO II,he passeth through me; he is around me even as the air!             35
19194,CANTO II,"O that I might be utterly no more! I desire to die--yea,"
19195,CANTO II,"the things that never had life, neither move they upon the"
19196,CANTO II,earth--behold! they seem precious to mine eyes. O that
19197,CANTO II,a man might live without the breath of his nostrils.  So
19198,CANTO II,"I might abide in darkness, and blackness, and an empty              40"
19199,CANTO II,"space! Yea, I would lie down, I would not rise, neither"
19200,CANTO II,would I stir my limbs till I became as the rock in the den
19201,CANTO II,"of the lion, on which the young lion resteth his head whilst he"
19202,CANTO II,sleepeth. For the torrent that roareth far off hath a voice:
19203,CANTO II,and the clouds in heaven look terribly on me; the Mighty One        45
19204,CANTO II,who is against me speaketh in the wind of the cedar grove;
19205,CANTO II,"and in silence am I dried up.' Then Enos spake to his father,"
19206,CANTO II,"'Arise, my father, arise, we are but a little way from the place"
19207,CANTO II,"where I found the cake and the pitcher.' And Cain said,"
19208,CANTO II,'How knowest thou!' and the child answered:--'Behold the            50
19209,CANTO II,bare rocks are a few of thy strides distant from the forest;
19210,CANTO II,"and while even now thou wert lifting up thy voice, I heard"
19211,CANTO II,"the echo.' Then the child took hold of his father, as if he"
19212,CANTO II,would raise him: and Cain being faint and feeble rose slowly
19213,CANTO II,"on his knees and pressed himself against the trunk of a fir,        55"
19214,CANTO II,and stood upright and followed the child.
19215,CANTO II,
19216,CANTO II,The path was dark till within three strides' length of its
19217,CANTO II,"termination, when it turned suddenly; the thick black trees"
19218,CANTO II,"formed a low arch, and the moonlight appeared for a moment"
19219,CANTO II,like a dazzling portal. Enos ran before and stood in the open       60
19220,CANTO II,"air; and when Cain, his father, emerged from the darkness,"
19221,CANTO II,the child was affrighted. For the mighty limbs of Cain were
19222,CANTO II,wasted as by fire; his hair was as the matted curls on the
19223,CANTO II,"bison's forehead, and so glared his fierce and sullen eye"
19224,CANTO II,"beneath: and the black abundant locks on either side, a rank        65"
19225,CANTO II,"and tangled mass, were stained and scorched, as though the"
19226,CANTO II,grasp of a burning iron hand had striven to rend them; and his
19227,CANTO II,countenance told in a strange and terrible language of agonies
19228,CANTO II,"that had been, and were, and were still to continue to be."
19229,CANTO II,
19230,CANTO II,The scene around was desolate; as far as the eye could              70
19231,CANTO II,"reach it was desolate: the bare rocks faced each other, and"
19232,CANTO II,left a long and wide interval of thin white sand. You might
19233,CANTO II,"wander on and look round and round, and peep into the"
19234,CANTO II,crevices of the rocks and discover nothing that acknowledged
19235,CANTO II,"the influence of the seasons. There was no spring, no summer,       75"
19236,CANTO II,"no autumn: and the winter's snow, that would have been"
19237,CANTO II,"lovely, fell not on these hot rocks and scorching sands. Never"
19238,CANTO II,morning lark had poised himself over this desert; but the huge
19239,CANTO II,"serpent often hissed there beneath the talons of the vulture, and"
19240,CANTO II,"the vulture screamed, his wings imprisoned within the coils of      80"
19241,CANTO II,the serpent. The pointed and shattered summits of the ridges
19242,CANTO II,"of the rocks made a rude mimicry of human concerns, and"
19243,CANTO II,seemed to prophecy mutely of things that then were not;
19244,CANTO II,"steeples, and battlements, and ships with naked masts. As far"
19245,CANTO II,"from the wood as a boy might sling a pebble of the brook, there     85"
19246,CANTO II,was one rock by itself at a small distance from the main ridge.
19247,CANTO II,It had been precipitated there perhaps by the groan which the
19248,CANTO II,"Earth uttered when our first father fell. Before you approached,"
19249,CANTO II,"it appeared to lie flat on the ground, but its base slanted from"
19250,CANTO II,"its point, and between its point and the sands a tall man might     90"
19251,CANTO II,stand upright. It was here that Enos had found the pitcher
19252,CANTO II,"and cake, and to this place he led his father. But ere they"
19253,CANTO II,had reached the rock they beheld a human shape: his back was
19254,CANTO II,"towards them, and they were advancing unperceived, when they"
19255,CANTO II,"heard him smite his breast and cry aloud, 'Woe is me! woe is        95"
19256,CANTO II,"me! I must never die again, and yet I am perishing with"
19257,CANTO II,thirst and hunger.'
19258,CANTO II,
19259,CANTO II,"Pallid, as the reflection of the sheeted lightning on the"
19260,CANTO II,"heavy-sailing night-cloud, became the face of Cain; but the"
19261,CANTO II,"child Enos took hold of the shaggy skin, his father's robe, and    100"
19262,CANTO II,"raised his eyes to his father, and listening whispered, 'Ere"
19263,CANTO II,"yet I could speak, I am sure, O my father, that I heard that"
19264,CANTO II,voice. Have not I often said that I remembered a sweet voice?
19265,CANTO II,O my father! this is it': and Cain trembled exceedingly.
19266,CANTO II,"The voice was sweet indeed, but it was thin and querulous,         105"
19267,CANTO II,"like that of a feeble slave in misery, who despairs altogether,"
19268,CANTO II,yet can not refrain himself from weeping and lamentation.
19269,CANTO II,"And, behold! Enos glided forward, and creeping softly round"
19270,CANTO II,"the base of the rock, stood before the stranger, and looked up"
19271,CANTO II,"into his face. And the Shape shrieked, and turned round,           110"
19272,CANTO II,"and Cain beheld him, that his limbs and his face were those"
19273,CANTO II,of his brother Abel whom he had killed! And Cain stood
19274,CANTO II,like one who struggles in his sleep because of the exceeding
19275,CANTO II,terribleness of a dream.
19276,CANTO II,
19277,CANTO II,"Thus as he stood in silence and darkness of soul, the              115"
19278,CANTO II,"Shape fell at his feet, and embraced his knees, and cried"
19279,CANTO II,"out with a bitter outcry, 'Thou eldest born of Adam, whom"
19280,CANTO II,"Eve, my mother, brought forth, cease to torment me! I was"
19281,CANTO II,"feeding my flocks in green pastures by the side of quiet rivers,"
19282,CANTO II,and thou killedst me; and now I am in misery.' Then Cain           120
19283,CANTO II,"closed his eyes, and hid them with his hands; and again he"
19284,CANTO II,"opened his eyes, and looked around him, and said to Enos,"
19285,CANTO II,"'What beholdest thou? Didst thou hear a voice, my son?'"
19286,CANTO II,"'Yes, my father, I beheld a man in unclean garments, and"
19287,CANTO II,"he uttered a sweet voice, full of lamentation.' Then Cain          125"
19288,CANTO II,"raised up the Shape that was like Abel, and said:--'The"
19289,CANTO II,"Creator of our father, who had respect unto thee, and unto"
19290,CANTO II,"thy offering, wherefore hath he forsaken thee?' Then the"
19291,CANTO II,"Shape shrieked a second time, and rent his garment, and"
19292,CANTO II,his naked skin was like the white sands beneath their feet;        130
19293,CANTO II,"and he shrieked yet a third time, and threw himself on his"
19294,CANTO II,face upon the sand that was black with the shadow of the
19295,CANTO II,"rock, and Cain and Enos sate beside him; the child by his"
19296,CANTO II,"right hand, and Cain by his left. They were all three under"
19297,CANTO II,"the rock, and within the shadow. The Shape that was like           135"
19298,CANTO II,"Abel raised himself up, and spake to the child, 'I know where"
19299,CANTO II,"the cold waters are, but I may not drink, wherefore didst"
19300,CANTO II,"thou then take away my pitcher?' But Cain said, 'Didst"
19301,CANTO II,thou not find favour in the sight of the Lord thy God?'
19302,CANTO II,"The Shape answered, 'The Lord is God of the living only,           140"
19303,CANTO II,the dead have another God.' Then the child Enos lifted up
19304,CANTO II,his eyes and prayed; but Cain rejoiced secretly in his heart.
19305,CANTO II,"'Wretched shall they be all the days of their mortal life,'"
19306,CANTO II,"exclaimed the Shape, 'who sacrifice worthy and acceptable"
19307,CANTO II,sacrifices to the God of the dead; but after death their toil      145
19308,CANTO II,"ceaseth. Woe is me, for I was well beloved by the God of"
19309,CANTO II,"the living, and cruel wert thou, O my brother, who didst"
19310,CANTO II,snatch me away from his power and his dominion.' Having
19311,CANTO II,"uttered these words, he rose suddenly, and fled over the sands:"
19312,CANTO II,"and Cain said in his heart, 'The curse of the Lord is on me;       150"
19313,CANTO II,"but who is the God of the dead?' and he ran after the Shape,"
19314,CANTO II,"and the Shape fled shrieking over the sands, and the sands"
19315,CANTO II,"rose like white mists behind the steps of Cain, but the feet"
19316,CANTO II,of him that was like Abel disturbed not the sands. He greatly
19317,CANTO II,"outrun Cain, and turning short, he wheeled round, and came         155"
19318,CANTO II,"again to the rock where they had been sitting, and where Enos"
19319,CANTO II,still stood; and the child caught hold of his garment as he
19320,CANTO II,"passed by, and he fell upon the ground. And Cain stopped,"
19321,CANTO II,"and beholding him not, said, 'he has passed into the dark"
19322,CANTO II,"woods,' and he walked slowly back to the rocks; and when he        160"
19323,CANTO II,reached it the child told him that he had caught hold of his
19324,CANTO II,"garment as he passed by, and that the man had fallen upon"
19325,CANTO II,"the ground: and Cain once more sate beside him, and said,"
19326,CANTO II,"'Abel, my brother, I would lament for thee, but that the spirit"
19327,CANTO II,"within me is withered, and burnt up with extreme agony.            165"
19328,CANTO II,"Now, I pray thee, by thy flocks, and by thy pastures, and"
19329,CANTO II,"by the quiet rivers which thou lovedst, that thou tell me all"
19330,CANTO II,that thou knowest. Who is the God of the dead? where doth
19331,CANTO II,he make his dwelling? what sacrifices are acceptable unto him?
19332,CANTO II,"for I have offered, but have not been received; I have prayed,     170"
19333,CANTO II,and have not been heard; and how can I be afflicted more than
19334,CANTO II,"I already am?' The Shape arose and answered, 'O that thou"
19335,CANTO II,"hadst had pity on me as I will have pity on thee. Follow me,"
19336,CANTO II,Son of Adam! and bring thy child with thee!'
19337,CANTO II,
19338,CANTO II,And they three passed over the white sands between the             175
19339,CANTO II,"rocks, silent as the shadows."

21958,FOOTNOTES:,In the church at Sockburn there is a recumbent statue of an 'armed

21960,FOOTNOTES:,there is a 'Grey-Stone' which is said to commemorate the slaying of a
21961,FOOTNOTES:,monstrous wyverne or 'worme' by the knight who is buried in the church.
21962,FOOTNOTES:,It is difficult to believe that the 'arméd knight' and the 'grey stone'
21963,FOOTNOTES:,"of the first draft were not suggested by the statue in Sockburn Church,"

22432,A METRICAL EPISTLE,
22433,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"MR. EDITOR,--An unmetrical letter from Talleyrand to Lord"
22434,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"Grenville has already appeared, and from an authority too high"
22435,A METRICAL EPISTLE,to be questioned: otherwise I could adduce some arguments for
22436,A METRICAL EPISTLE,the exclusive authenticity of the following metrical epistle.
22437,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"The very epithet which the wise ancients used, '_aurea"
22438,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"carmina_,' might have been supposed likely to have determined"
22439,A METRICAL EPISTLE,the choice of the French minister in favour of verse; and the
22440,A METRICAL EPISTLE,rather when we recollect that this phrase of '_golden verses_'
22441,A METRICAL EPISTLE,is applied emphatically to the works of that philosopher who
22442,A METRICAL EPISTLE,imposed _silence_ on all with whom he had to deal. Besides is
22443,A METRICAL EPISTLE,it not somewhat improbable that Talleyrand should have
22444,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"preferred prose to rhyme, when the latter alone _has got the"
22445,A METRICAL EPISTLE,chink_? Is it not likewise curious that in our official answer
22446,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"no notice whatever is taken of the Chief Consul, Bonaparte, as"
22447,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"if there had been no such person [man _Essays, &c., 1850_]"
22448,A METRICAL EPISTLE,existing; notwithstanding that his existence is pretty
22449,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"generally admitted, nay that some have been so rash as to"
22450,A METRICAL EPISTLE,believe that he has created as great a sensation in the world
22451,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"as Lord Grenville, or even the Duke of Portland? But the"
22452,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"Minister of Foreign Affairs, Talleyrand, is acknowledged,"
22453,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"which, in our opinion, could not have happened had he written"
22454,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"only that insignificant prose-letter, which seems to precede"
22455,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"Bonaparte's, as in old romances a dwarf always ran before to"
22456,A METRICAL EPISTLE,proclaim the advent or arrival of knight or giant. That
22457,A METRICAL EPISTLE,Talleyrand's character and practices more resemble those of
22458,A METRICAL EPISTLE,some _regular_ Governments than Bonaparte's I admit; but this
22459,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"of itself does not appear a satisfactory explanation. However,"
22460,A METRICAL EPISTLE,let the letter speak for itself. The second line is
22461,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"supererogative in syllables, whether from the oscitancy of the"
22462,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"transcriber, or from the trepidation which might have"
22463,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"overpowered the modest Frenchman, on finding himself in the"
22464,A METRICAL EPISTLE,"act of writing to so _great_ a man, I shall not dare to"

25922,A LAMENT,branch from another date-tree had been conveyed from a distance of     20
25923,A LAMENT,some hundred leagues. The first leaf of the MS. from which the poem
25924,A LAMENT,"has been transcribed, and which contained the two or three introductory"
25925,A LAMENT,"stanzas, is wanting: and the author has in vain taxed his memory to"
25926,A LAMENT,repair the loss. But a rude draught of the poem contains the substance
25927,A LAMENT,"of the stanzas, and the reader is requested to receive it as the"
25928,A LAMENT,substitute.                                                        25

26459,INDIVIDUAL MIND,
26460,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Friend of the wise! and Teacher of the Good!
26461,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Into my heart have I received that Lay
26462,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"More than historic, that prophetic Lay"
26463,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Wherein (high theme by thee first sung aright)
26464,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Of the foundations and the building up                               5
26465,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Of a Human Spirit thou hast dared to tell
26466,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"What may be told, to the understanding mind"
26467,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Revealable; and what within the mind
26468,INDIVIDUAL MIND,By vital breathings secret as the soul
26469,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of vernal growth, oft quickens in the heart                         10"
26470,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Thoughts all too deep for words!--
26471,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Theme hard as high!
26472,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of smiles spontaneous, and mysterious fears"
26473,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"(The first-born they of Reason and twin-birth),"
26474,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of tides obedient to external force,"
26475,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And currents self-determined, as might seem,                        15"
26476,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Or by some inner Power; of moments awful,"
26477,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Now in thy inner life, and now abroad,"
26478,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"When power streamed from thee, and thy soul received"
26479,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"The light reflected, as a light bestowed--"
26480,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of fancies fair, and milder hours of youth,                         20"
26481,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Hyblean murmurs of poetic thought
26482,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Industrious in its joy, in vales and glens"
26483,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Native or outland, lakes and famous hills!"
26484,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Or on the lonely high-road, when the stars"
26485,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Were rising; or by secret mountain-streams,                         25"
26486,INDIVIDUAL MIND,The guides and the companions of thy way!
26487,INDIVIDUAL MIND,
26488,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of more than Fancy, of the Social Sense"
26489,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Distending wide, and man beloved as man,"
26490,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Where France in all her towns lay vibrating
26491,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Like some becalméd bark beneath the burst                           30
26492,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of Heaven's immediate thunder, when no cloud"
26493,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Is visible, or shadow on the main."
26494,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"For thou wert there, thine own brows garlanded,"
26495,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Amid the tremor of a realm aglow,"
26496,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Amid a mighty nation jubilant,                                      35"
26497,INDIVIDUAL MIND,When from the general heart of human kind
26498,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Hope sprang forth like a full-born Deity!
26499,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"----Of that dear Hope afflicted and struck down,"
26500,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"So summoned homeward, thenceforth calm and sure"
26501,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"From the dread watch-tower of man's absolute self,                  40"
26502,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"With light unwaning on her eyes, to look"
26503,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Far on--herself a glory to behold,"
26504,INDIVIDUAL MIND,The Angel of the vision! Then (last strain)
26505,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of Duty, chosen Laws controlling choice,"
26506,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Action and joy!--An Orphic song indeed,                             45"
26507,INDIVIDUAL MIND,A song divine of high and passionate thoughts
26508,INDIVIDUAL MIND,To their own music chaunted!
26509,INDIVIDUAL MIND,
26510,INDIVIDUAL MIND,O great Bard!
26511,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Ere yet that last strain dying awed the air,"
26512,INDIVIDUAL MIND,With stedfast eye I viewed thee in the choir
26513,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Of ever-enduring men. The truly great                               50
26514,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Have all one age, and from one visible space"
26515,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Shed influence! They, both in power and act,"
26516,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Are permanent, and Time is not with them,"
26517,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Save as it worketh for them, they in it."
26518,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Nor less a sacred Roll, than those of old,                          55"
26519,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And to be placed, as they, with gradual fame"
26520,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Among the archives of mankind, thy work"
26521,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Makes audible a linkéd lay of Truth,"
26522,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Of Truth profound a sweet continuous lay,"
26523,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Not learnt, but native, her own natural notes!                      60"
26524,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Ah! as I listened with a heart forlorn,"
26525,INDIVIDUAL MIND,The pulses of my being beat anew:
26526,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And even as Life returns upon the drowned,"
26527,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Life's joy rekindling roused a throng of pains--
26528,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Keen pangs of Love, awakening as a babe                             65"
26529,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Turbulent, with an outcry in the heart;"
26530,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And fears self-willed, that shunned the eye of Hope;"
26531,INDIVIDUAL MIND,And Hope that scarce would know itself from Fear;
26532,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Sense of past Youth, and Manhood come in vain,"
26533,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And Genius given, and Knowledge won in vain;                        70"
26534,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And all which I had culled in wood-walks wild,"
26535,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And all which patient toil had reared, and all,"
26536,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Commune with thee had opened out--but flowers
26537,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Strewed on my corse, and borne upon my bier,"
26538,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"In the same coffin, for the self-same grave!                        75"
26539,INDIVIDUAL MIND,
26540,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"That way no more! and ill beseems it me,"
26541,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Who came a welcomer in herald's guise,"
26542,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Singing of Glory, and Futurity,"
26543,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"To wander back on such unhealthful road,"
26544,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Plucking the poisons of self-harm! And ill                          80
26545,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Such intertwine beseems triumphal wreaths
26546,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Strew'd before thy advancing!
26547,INDIVIDUAL MIND,
26548,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Nor do thou,"
26549,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Sage Bard! impair the memory of that hour
26550,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Of thy communion with my nobler mind
26551,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"By pity or grief, already felt too long!                            85"
26552,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Nor let my words import more blame than needs.
26553,INDIVIDUAL MIND,The tumult rose and ceased: for Peace is nigh
26554,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Where Wisdom's voice has found a listening heart.
26555,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Amid the howl of more than wintry storms,"
26556,INDIVIDUAL MIND,The Halcyon hears the voice of vernal hours                         90
26557,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Already on the wing.
26558,INDIVIDUAL MIND,
26559,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Eve following eve,"
26560,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of Home"
26561,INDIVIDUAL MIND,Is sweetest! moments for their own sake hailed
26562,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And more desired, more precious, for thy song,"
26563,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"In silence listening, like a devout child,                          95"
26564,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"My soul lay passive, by thy various strain"
26565,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Driven as in surges now beneath the stars,"
26566,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"With momentary stars of my own birth,"
26567,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Fair constellated foam,[408:1] still darting off"
26568,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Into the darkness; now a tranquil sea,                             100"
26569,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the moon."
26570,INDIVIDUAL MIND,
26571,INDIVIDUAL MIND,And when--O Friend! my comforter and guide!
26572,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Strong in thyself, and powerful to give strength!--"
26573,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Thy long sustainéd Song finally closed,"
26574,INDIVIDUAL MIND,And thy deep voice had ceased--yet thou thyself                    105
26575,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Wert still before my eyes, and round us both"
26576,INDIVIDUAL MIND,That happy vision of belovéd faces--
26577,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Scarce conscious, and yet conscious of its close"
26578,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"I sate, my being blended in one thought"
26579,INDIVIDUAL MIND,(Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?)                       110
26580,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound--"
26581,INDIVIDUAL MIND,"And when I rose, I found myself in prayer."
