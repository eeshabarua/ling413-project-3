94,FIRST BOOK.,
95,FIRST BOOK.,
96,FIRST BOOK.,OF writing many books there is no end;
97,FIRST BOOK.,And I who have written much in prose and verse
98,FIRST BOOK.,"For others’ uses, will write now for mine,—"
99,FIRST BOOK.,"Will write my story for my better self,"
100,FIRST BOOK.,"As when you paint your portrait for a friend,"
101,FIRST BOOK.,Who keeps it in a drawer and looks at it
102,FIRST BOOK.,"Long after he has ceased to love you, just"
103,FIRST BOOK.,To hold together what he was and is.
104,FIRST BOOK.,
105,FIRST BOOK.,"I, writing thus, am still what men call young;"
106,FIRST BOOK.,I have not so far left the coasts of life
107,FIRST BOOK.,"To travel inland, that I cannot hear"
108,FIRST BOOK.,That murmur of the outer Infinite
109,FIRST BOOK.,Which unweaned babies smile at in their sleep
110,FIRST BOOK.,"When wondered at for smiling; not so far,"
111,FIRST BOOK.,But still I catch my mother at her post
112,FIRST BOOK.,"Beside the nursery-door, with finger up,"
113,FIRST BOOK.,"‘Hush, hush—here’s too much noise!’ while her sweet eyes"
114,FIRST BOOK.,"Leap forward, taking part against her word"
115,FIRST BOOK.,In the child’s riot. Still I sit and feel
116,FIRST BOOK.,"My father’s slow hand, when she had left us both,"
117,FIRST BOOK.,Stroke out my childish curls across his knee;
118,FIRST BOOK.,And hear Assunta’s daily jest (she knew
119,FIRST BOOK.,He liked it better than a better jest)
120,FIRST BOOK.,Inquire how many golden scudi went
121,FIRST BOOK.,"To make such ringlets. O my father’s hand,"
122,FIRST BOOK.,"Stroke the poor hair down, stroke it heavily,—"
123,FIRST BOOK.,"Draw, press the child’s head closer to thy knee!"
124,FIRST BOOK.,"I’m still too young, too young, to sit alone."
125,FIRST BOOK.,
126,FIRST BOOK.,"I write. My mother was a Florentine,"
127,FIRST BOOK.,Whose rare blue eyes were shut from seeing me
128,FIRST BOOK.,"When scarcely I was four years old; my life,"
129,FIRST BOOK.,A poor spark snatched up from a failing lamp
130,FIRST BOOK.,Which went out therefore. She was weak and frail;
131,FIRST BOOK.,She could not bear the joy of giving life—
132,FIRST BOOK.,The mother’s rapture slew her. If her kiss
133,FIRST BOOK.,"Had left a longer weight upon my lips,"
134,FIRST BOOK.,"It might have steadied the uneasy breath,"
135,FIRST BOOK.,And reconciled and fraternised my soul
136,FIRST BOOK.,"With the new order. As it was, indeed,"
137,FIRST BOOK.,"I felt a mother-want about the world,"
138,FIRST BOOK.,"And still went seeking, like a bleating lamb"
139,FIRST BOOK.,"Left out at night, in shutting up the fold,—"
140,FIRST BOOK.,As restless as a nest-deserted bird
141,FIRST BOOK.,"Grown chill through something being away, though what"
142,FIRST BOOK.,"It knows not. I, Aurora Leigh, was born"
143,FIRST BOOK.,"To make my father sadder, and myself"
144,FIRST BOOK.,"Not overjoyous, truly. Women know"
145,FIRST BOOK.,"The way to rear up children, (to be just,)"
146,FIRST BOOK.,"They know a simple, merry, tender knack"
147,FIRST BOOK.,"Of tying sashes, fitting baby-shoes,"
148,FIRST BOOK.,"And stringing pretty words that make no sense,"
149,FIRST BOOK.,And kissing full sense into empty words;
150,FIRST BOOK.,"Which things are corals to cut life upon,"
151,FIRST BOOK.,"Although such trifles: children learn by such,"
152,FIRST BOOK.,"Love’s holy earnest in a pretty play,"
153,FIRST BOOK.,"And get not over-early solemnised,—"
154,FIRST BOOK.,"But seeing, as in a rose-bush, Love’s Divine,"
155,FIRST BOOK.,"Which burns and hurts not,—not a single bloom,—"
156,FIRST BOOK.,Become aware and unafraid of Love.
157,FIRST BOOK.,Such good do mothers. Fathers love as well
158,FIRST BOOK.,"—Mine did, I know,—but still with heavier brains,"
159,FIRST BOOK.,"And wills more consciously responsible,"
160,FIRST BOOK.,"And not as wisely, since less foolishly;"
161,FIRST BOOK.,So mothers have God’s licence to be missed.
162,FIRST BOOK.,
163,FIRST BOOK.,"My father was an austere Englishman,"
164,FIRST BOOK.,"Who, after a dry life-time spent at home"
165,FIRST BOOK.,"In college-learning, law, and parish talk,"
166,FIRST BOOK.,"Was flooded with a passion unaware,"
167,FIRST BOOK.,His whole provisioned and complacent past
168,FIRST BOOK.,Drowned out from him that moment. As he stood
169,FIRST BOOK.,"In Florence, where he had come to spend a month"
170,FIRST BOOK.,"And note the secret of Da Vinci’s drains,"
171,FIRST BOOK.,He musing somewhat absently perhaps
172,FIRST BOOK.,Some English question ... whether men should pay
173,FIRST BOOK.,The unpopular but necessary tax
174,FIRST BOOK.,With left or right hand—in the alien sun
175,FIRST BOOK.,"In that great square of the Santissima,"
176,FIRST BOOK.,There drifted past him (scarcely marked enough
177,FIRST BOOK.,"To move his comfortable island-scorn,)"
178,FIRST BOOK.,"A train of priestly banners, cross and psalm,—"
179,FIRST BOOK.,The white-veiled rose-crowned maidens holding up
180,FIRST BOOK.,"Tall tapers, weighty for such wrists, aslant"
181,FIRST BOOK.,"To the blue luminous tremor of the air,"
182,FIRST BOOK.,And letting drop the white wax as they went
183,FIRST BOOK.,To eat the bishop’s wafer at the church;
184,FIRST BOOK.,"From which long trail of chanting priests and girls,"
185,FIRST BOOK.,"A face flashed like a cymbal on his face,"
186,FIRST BOOK.,"And shook with silent clangour brain and heart,"
187,FIRST BOOK.,"Transfiguring him to music. Thus, even thus,"
188,FIRST BOOK.,He too received his sacramental gift
189,FIRST BOOK.,With eucharistic meanings; for he loved.
190,FIRST BOOK.,
191,FIRST BOOK.,"And thus beloved, she died. I’ve heard it said"
192,FIRST BOOK.,That but to see him in the first surprise
193,FIRST BOOK.,"Of widower and father, nursing me,"
194,FIRST BOOK.,"Unmothered little child of four years old,"
195,FIRST BOOK.,"His large man’s hands afraid to touch my curls,"
196,FIRST BOOK.,"As if the gold would tarnish,—his grave lips"
197,FIRST BOOK.,"Contriving such a miserable smile,"
198,FIRST BOOK.,"As if he knew needs must, or I should die,"
199,FIRST BOOK.,"And yet ’twas hard,—would almost make the stones"
200,FIRST BOOK.,Cry out for pity. There’s a verse he set
201,FIRST BOOK.,"In Santa Croce to her memory,"
202,FIRST BOOK.,‘Weep for an infant too young to weep much
203,FIRST BOOK.,When death removed this mother’—stops the mirth
204,FIRST BOOK.,"To-day, on women’s faces when they walk"
205,FIRST BOOK.,"With rosy children hanging on their gowns,"
206,FIRST BOOK.,"Under the cloister, to escape the sun"
207,FIRST BOOK.,"That scorches in the piazza. After which,"
208,FIRST BOOK.,"He left our Florence, and made haste to hide"
209,FIRST BOOK.,"Himself, his prattling child, and silent grief,"
210,FIRST BOOK.,Among the mountains above Pelago;
211,FIRST BOOK.,"Because unmothered babes, he thought, had need"
212,FIRST BOOK.,"Of mother nature more than others use,"
213,FIRST BOOK.,"And Pan’s white goats, with udders warm and full"
214,FIRST BOOK.,"Of mystic contemplations, come to feed"
215,FIRST BOOK.,Poor milkless lips of orphans like his own—
216,FIRST BOOK.,"Such scholar-scraps he talked, I’ve heard from friends,"
217,FIRST BOOK.,"For even prosaic men, who wear grief long,"
218,FIRST BOOK.,Will get to wear it as a hat aside
219,FIRST BOOK.,"With a flower stuck in’t. Father, then, and child,"
220,FIRST BOOK.,"We lived among the mountains many years,"
221,FIRST BOOK.,"God’s silence on the outside of the house,"
222,FIRST BOOK.,"And we, who did not speak too loud, within;"
223,FIRST BOOK.,"And old Assunta to make up the fire,"
224,FIRST BOOK.,Crossing herself whene’er a sudden flame
225,FIRST BOOK.,"Which lightened from the firewood, made alive"
226,FIRST BOOK.,That picture of my mother on the wall.
227,FIRST BOOK.,The painter drew it after she was dead;
228,FIRST BOOK.,"And when the face was finished, throat and hands,"
229,FIRST BOOK.,"Her cameriera carried him, in hate"
230,FIRST BOOK.,"Of the English-fashioned shroud, the last brocade"
231,FIRST BOOK.,She dressed in at the Pitti. ‘He should paint
232,FIRST BOOK.,"No sadder thing than that,’ she swore, ‘to wrong"
233,FIRST BOOK.,Her poor signora.’ Therefore very strange
234,FIRST BOOK.,"The effect was. I, a little child, would crouch"
235,FIRST BOOK.,"For hours upon the floor, with knees drawn up,"
236,FIRST BOOK.,"And gaze across them, half in terror, half"
237,FIRST BOOK.,"In adoration, at the picture there,—"
238,FIRST BOOK.,"That swan-like supernatural white life,"
239,FIRST BOOK.,Just sailing upward from the red stiff silk
240,FIRST BOOK.,"Which seemed to have no part in it, nor power"
241,FIRST BOOK.,To keep it from quite breaking out of bounds:
242,FIRST BOOK.,For hours I sate and stared. Assunta’s awe
243,FIRST BOOK.,And my poor father’s melancholy eyes
244,FIRST BOOK.,"Still pointed that way. That way, went my thoughts"
245,FIRST BOOK.,When wandering beyond sight. And as I grew
246,FIRST BOOK.,"In years, I mixed, confused, unconsciously,"
247,FIRST BOOK.,"Whatever I last read or heard or dreamed,"
248,FIRST BOOK.,"Abhorrent, admirable, beautiful,"
249,FIRST BOOK.,"Pathetical, or ghastly, or grotesque,"
250,FIRST BOOK.,"With still that face ... which did not therefore change,"
251,FIRST BOOK.,But kept the mystic level of all forms
252,FIRST BOOK.,And fears and admirations; was by turns
253,FIRST BOOK.,"Ghost, fiend, and angel, fairy, witch, and sprite,—"
254,FIRST BOOK.,"A dauntless Muse who eyes a dreadful Fate,"
255,FIRST BOOK.,"A loving Psyche who loses sight of Love,"
256,FIRST BOOK.,"A still Medusa, with mild milky brows"
257,FIRST BOOK.,All curdled and all clothed upon with snakes
258,FIRST BOOK.,"Whose slime falls fast as sweat will; or, anon,"
259,FIRST BOOK.,"Our Lady of the Passion, stabbed with swords"
260,FIRST BOOK.,"Where the Babe sucked; or, Lamia in her first"
261,FIRST BOOK.,"Moonlighted pallor, ere she shrunk and blinked,"
262,FIRST BOOK.,"And, shuddering, wriggled down to the unclean;"
263,FIRST BOOK.,"Or, my own mother, leaving her last smile"
264,FIRST BOOK.,"In her last kiss, upon the baby-mouth"
265,FIRST BOOK.,"My father pushed down on the bed for that,—"
266,FIRST BOOK.,"Or my dead mother, without smile or kiss,"
267,FIRST BOOK.,"Buried at Florence. All which images,"
268,FIRST BOOK.,"Concentred on the picture, glassed themselves"
269,FIRST BOOK.,"Before my meditative childhood, ... as"
270,FIRST BOOK.,The incoherencies of change and death
271,FIRST BOOK.,"Are represented fully, mixed and merged,"
272,FIRST BOOK.,In the smooth fair mystery of perpetual Life.
273,FIRST BOOK.,
274,FIRST BOOK.,And while I stared away my childish wits
275,FIRST BOOK.,"Upon my mother’s picture, (ah, poor child!)"
276,FIRST BOOK.,"My father, who through love had suddenly"
277,FIRST BOOK.,"Thrown off the old conventions, broken loose"
278,FIRST BOOK.,"From chin-bands of the soul, like Lazarus,"
279,FIRST BOOK.,Yet had no time to learn to talk and walk
280,FIRST BOOK.,"Or grow anew familiar with the sun,—"
281,FIRST BOOK.,"Who had reached to freedom, not to action, lived,"
282,FIRST BOOK.,"But lived as one entranced, with thoughts, not aims,—"
283,FIRST BOOK.,Whom love had unmade from a common man
284,FIRST BOOK.,"But not completed to an uncommon man,—"
285,FIRST BOOK.,My father taught me what he had learnt the best
286,FIRST BOOK.,"Before he died and left me,—grief and love."
287,FIRST BOOK.,"And, seeing we had books among the hills,"
288,FIRST BOOK.,"Strong words of counselling souls, confederate"
289,FIRST BOOK.,"With vocal pines and waters,—out of books"
290,FIRST BOOK.,"He taught me all the ignorance of men,"
291,FIRST BOOK.,And how God laughs in heaven when any man
292,FIRST BOOK.,"Says ‘Here I’m learned; this, I understand;"
293,FIRST BOOK.,"In that, I am never caught at fault or doubt.’"
294,FIRST BOOK.,"He sent the schools to school, demonstrating"
295,FIRST BOOK.,"A fool will pass for such through one mistake,"
296,FIRST BOOK.,"While a philosopher will pass for such,"
297,FIRST BOOK.,Through said mistakes being ventured in the gross
298,FIRST BOOK.,And heaped up to a system.
299,FIRST BOOK.,"I am like,"
300,FIRST BOOK.,"They tell me, my dear father. Broader brows"
301,FIRST BOOK.,"Howbeit, upon a slenderer undergrowth"
302,FIRST BOOK.,"Of delicate features,—paler, near as grave;"
303,FIRST BOOK.,"But then my mother’s smile breaks up the whole,"
304,FIRST BOOK.,And makes it better sometimes than itself.
305,FIRST BOOK.,
306,FIRST BOOK.,"So, nine full years, our days were hid with God"
307,FIRST BOOK.,"Among his mountains. I was just thirteen,"
308,FIRST BOOK.,Still growing like the plants from unseen roots
309,FIRST BOOK.,"In tongue-tied Springs,—and suddenly awoke"
310,FIRST BOOK.,"To full life and its needs and agonies,"
311,FIRST BOOK.,"With an intense, strong, struggling heart beside"
312,FIRST BOOK.,"A stone-dead father. Life, struck sharp on death,"
313,FIRST BOOK.,"Makes awful lightning. His last word was, ‘Love—’"
314,FIRST BOOK.,"‘Love, my child, love, love!’—(then he had done with grief)"
315,FIRST BOOK.,"‘Love, my child.’ Ere I answered he was gone,"
316,FIRST BOOK.,And none was left to love in all the world.
317,FIRST BOOK.,
318,FIRST BOOK.,"There, ended childhood: what succeeded next"
319,FIRST BOOK.,"I recollect as, after fevers, men"
320,FIRST BOOK.,"Thread back the passage of delirium,"
321,FIRST BOOK.,"Missing the turn still, baffled by the door;"
322,FIRST BOOK.,"Smooth endless days, notched here and there with knives;"
323,FIRST BOOK.,"A weary, wormy darkness, spurred i’ the flank"
324,FIRST BOOK.,"With flame, that it should eat and end itself"
325,FIRST BOOK.,"Like some tormented scorpion. Then, at last,"
326,FIRST BOOK.,"I do remember clearly, how there came"
327,FIRST BOOK.,"A stranger with authority, not right,"
328,FIRST BOOK.,"(I thought not) who commanded, caught me up"
329,FIRST BOOK.,"From old Assunta’s neck; how, with a shriek,"
330,FIRST BOOK.,"She let me go,—while I, with ears too full"
331,FIRST BOOK.,"Of my father’s silence, to shriek back a word,"
332,FIRST BOOK.,In all a child’s astonishment at grief
333,FIRST BOOK.,"Stared at the wharfage where she stood and moaned,"
334,FIRST BOOK.,"My poor Assunta, where she stood and moaned!"
335,FIRST BOOK.,"The white walls, the blue hills, my Italy,"
336,FIRST BOOK.,"Drawn backward from the shuddering steamer-deck,"
337,FIRST BOOK.,Like one in anger drawing back her skirts
338,FIRST BOOK.,Which suppliants catch at. Then the bitter sea
339,FIRST BOOK.,"Inexorably pushed between us both,"
340,FIRST BOOK.,And sweeping up the ship with my despair
341,FIRST BOOK.,Threw us out as a pasture to the stars.
342,FIRST BOOK.,
343,FIRST BOOK.,Ten nights and days we voyaged on the deep;
344,FIRST BOOK.,"Ten nights and days, without the common face"
345,FIRST BOOK.,Of any day or night; the moon and sun
346,FIRST BOOK.,"Cut off from the green reconciling earth,"
347,FIRST BOOK.,To starve into a blind ferocity
348,FIRST BOOK.,And glare unnatural; the very sky
349,FIRST BOOK.,(Dropping its bell-net down upon the sea
350,FIRST BOOK.,"As if no human heart should scape alive,)"
351,FIRST BOOK.,"Bedraggled with the desolating salt,"
352,FIRST BOOK.,Until it seemed no more that holy heaven
353,FIRST BOOK.,"To which my father went. All new, and strange—"
354,FIRST BOOK.,"The universe turned stranger, for a child."
355,FIRST BOOK.,
356,FIRST BOOK.,"Then, land!—then, England! oh, the frosty cliffs"
357,FIRST BOOK.,Looked cold upon me. Could I find a home
358,FIRST BOOK.,Among those mean red houses through the fog?
359,FIRST BOOK.,And when I heard my father’s language first
360,FIRST BOOK.,"From alien lips which had no kiss for mine,"
361,FIRST BOOK.,"I wept aloud, then laughed, then wept, then wept,—"
362,FIRST BOOK.,And some one near me said the child was mad
363,FIRST BOOK.,Through much sea-sickness. The train swept us on.
364,FIRST BOOK.,Was this my father’s England? the great isle?
365,FIRST BOOK.,The ground seemed cut up from the fellowship
366,FIRST BOOK.,"Of verdure, field from field, as man from man;"
367,FIRST BOOK.,"The skies themselves looked low and positive,"
368,FIRST BOOK.,"As almost you could touch them with a hand,"
369,FIRST BOOK.,"And dared to do it, they were so far off"
370,FIRST BOOK.,"From God’s celestial crystals; all things, blurred"
371,FIRST BOOK.,And dull and vague. Did Shakspeare and his mates
372,FIRST BOOK.,Absorb the light here?—not a hill or stone
373,FIRST BOOK.,With heart to strike a radiant colour up
374,FIRST BOOK.,Or active outline on the indifferent air!
375,FIRST BOOK.,
376,FIRST BOOK.,I think I see my father’s sister stand
377,FIRST BOOK.,Upon the hall-step of her country-house
378,FIRST BOOK.,"To give me welcome. She stood straight and calm,"
379,FIRST BOOK.,Her somewhat narrow forehead braided tight
380,FIRST BOOK.,As if for taming accidental thoughts
381,FIRST BOOK.,From possible pulses; brown hair pricked with grey
382,FIRST BOOK.,"By frigid use of life, (she was not old,"
383,FIRST BOOK.,Although my father’s elder by a year)
384,FIRST BOOK.,"A nose drawn sharply, yet in delicate lines;"
385,FIRST BOOK.,"A close mild mouth, a little soured about"
386,FIRST BOOK.,"The ends, through speaking unrequited loves,"
387,FIRST BOOK.,Or peradventure niggardly half-truths;
388,FIRST BOOK.,"Eyes of no colour,—once they might have smiled,"
389,FIRST BOOK.,"But never, never have forgot themselves"
390,FIRST BOOK.,"In smiling; cheeks, in which was yet a rose"
391,FIRST BOOK.,"Of perished summers, like a rose in a book,"
392,FIRST BOOK.,"Kept more for ruth than pleasure,—if past bloom,"
393,FIRST BOOK.,Past fading also.
394,FIRST BOOK.,"She had lived, we’ll say,"
395,FIRST BOOK.,"A harmless life, she called a virtuous life,"
396,FIRST BOOK.,"A quiet life, which was not life at all,"
397,FIRST BOOK.,"(But that, she had not lived enough to know)"
398,FIRST BOOK.,"Between the vicar and the county squires,"
399,FIRST BOOK.,The lord-lieutenant looking down sometimes
400,FIRST BOOK.,"From the empyreal, to assure their souls"
401,FIRST BOOK.,"Against chance-vulgarisms, and, in the abyss,"
402,FIRST BOOK.,"The apothecary looked on once a year,"
403,FIRST BOOK.,To prove their soundness of humility.
404,FIRST BOOK.,The poor-club exercised her Christian gifts
405,FIRST BOOK.,"Of knitting stockings, stitching petticoats,"
406,FIRST BOOK.,Because we are of one flesh after all
407,FIRST BOOK.,"And need one flannel, (with a proper sense"
408,FIRST BOOK.,Of difference in the quality)—and still
409,FIRST BOOK.,"The book-club, guarded from your modern trick"
410,FIRST BOOK.,"Of shaking dangerous questions from the crease,"
411,FIRST BOOK.,Preserved her intellectual. She had lived
412,FIRST BOOK.,"A sort of cage-bird life, born in a cage,"
413,FIRST BOOK.,Accounting that to leap from perch to perch
414,FIRST BOOK.,Was act and joy enough for any bird.
415,FIRST BOOK.,"Dear heaven, how silly are the things that live"
416,FIRST BOOK.,"In thickets, and eat berries!"
417,FIRST BOOK.,"I, alas,"
418,FIRST BOOK.,"A wild bird scarcely fledged, was brought to her cage,"
419,FIRST BOOK.,And she was there to meet me. Very kind.
420,FIRST BOOK.,Bring the clean water; give out the fresh seed.

422,FIRST BOOK.,"She stood upon the steps to welcome me,"
423,FIRST BOOK.,"Calm, in black garb. I clung about her neck,—"
424,FIRST BOOK.,"Young babes, who catch at every shred of wool"
425,FIRST BOOK.,"To draw the new light closer, catch and cling"
426,FIRST BOOK.,"Less blindly. In my ears, my father’s word"
427,FIRST BOOK.,"Hummed ignorantly, as the sea in shells,"
428,FIRST BOOK.,"‘Love, love, my child.’ She, black there with my grief,"
429,FIRST BOOK.,Might feel my love—she was his sister once—
430,FIRST BOOK.,"I clung to her. A moment, she seemed moved,"
431,FIRST BOOK.,"Kissed me with cold lips, suffered me to cling,"
432,FIRST BOOK.,"And drew me feebly through the hall, into"
433,FIRST BOOK.,The room she sate in.
434,FIRST BOOK.,"There, with some strange spasm"
435,FIRST BOOK.,"Of pain and passion, she wrung loose my hands"
436,FIRST BOOK.,"Imperiously, and held me at arm’s length,"
437,FIRST BOOK.,And with two grey-steel naked-bladed eyes
438,FIRST BOOK.,"Searched through my face,—ay, stabbed it through and through,"
439,FIRST BOOK.,"Through brows and cheeks and chin, as if to find"
440,FIRST BOOK.,"A wicked murderer in my innocent face,"
441,FIRST BOOK.,"If not here, there perhaps. Then, drawing breath,"
442,FIRST BOOK.,"She struggled for her ordinary calm,"
443,FIRST BOOK.,"And missed it rather,—told me not to shrink,"
444,FIRST BOOK.,"As if she had told me not to lie or swear,—"
445,FIRST BOOK.,"‘She loved my father, and would love me too"
446,FIRST BOOK.,As long as I deserved it.’ Very kind.
447,FIRST BOOK.,
448,FIRST BOOK.,I understood her meaning afterward;
449,FIRST BOOK.,"She thought to find my mother in my face,"
450,FIRST BOOK.,"And questioned it for that. For she, my aunt,"
451,FIRST BOOK.,"Had loved my father truly, as she could,"
452,FIRST BOOK.,"And hated, with the gall of gentle souls,"
453,FIRST BOOK.,"My Tuscan mother, who had fooled away"
454,FIRST BOOK.,"A wise man from wise courses, a good man"
455,FIRST BOOK.,"From obvious duties, and, depriving her,"
456,FIRST BOOK.,"His sister, of the household precedence,"
457,FIRST BOOK.,"Had wronged his tenants, robbed his native land,"
458,FIRST BOOK.,"And made him mad, alike by life and death,"
459,FIRST BOOK.,In love and sorrow. She had pored for years
460,FIRST BOOK.,What sort of woman could be suitable
461,FIRST BOOK.,"To her sort of hate, to entertain it with;"
462,FIRST BOOK.,"And so, her very curiosity"
463,FIRST BOOK.,"Became hate too, and all the idealism"
464,FIRST BOOK.,"She ever used in life, was used for hate,"
465,FIRST BOOK.,"Till hate, so nourished, did exceed at last"
466,FIRST BOOK.,"The love from which it grew, in strength and heat,"
467,FIRST BOOK.,And wrinkled her smooth conscience with a sense
468,FIRST BOOK.,"Of disputable virtue (say not, sin)"
469,FIRST BOOK.,When Christian doctrine was enforced at church.
470,FIRST BOOK.,
471,FIRST BOOK.,And thus my father’s sister was to me
472,FIRST BOOK.,"My mother’s hater. From that day, she did"
473,FIRST BOOK.,"Her duty to me, (I appreciate it"
474,FIRST BOOK.,In her own word as spoken to herself)
475,FIRST BOOK.,"Her duty, in large measure, well-pressed out,"
476,FIRST BOOK.,"But measured always. She was generous, bland,"
477,FIRST BOOK.,"More courteous than was tender, gave me still"
478,FIRST BOOK.,"The first place,—as if fearful that God’s saints"
479,FIRST BOOK.,"Would look down suddenly and say, ‘Herein"
480,FIRST BOOK.,"You missed a point, I think, through lack of love.’"
481,FIRST BOOK.,"Alas, a mother never is afraid"
482,FIRST BOOK.,"Of speaking angerly to any child,"
483,FIRST BOOK.,"Since love, she knows, is justified of love."
484,FIRST BOOK.,
485,FIRST BOOK.,"And I, I was a good child on the whole,"
486,FIRST BOOK.,A meek and manageable child. Why not?
487,FIRST BOOK.,"I did not live, to have the faults of life:"
488,FIRST BOOK.,There seemed more true life in my father’s grave
489,FIRST BOOK.,Than in all England. Since _that_ threw me off
490,FIRST BOOK.,"Who fain would cleave, (his latest will, they say,"
491,FIRST BOOK.,Consigned me to his land) I only thought
492,FIRST BOOK.,Of lying quiet there where I was thrown
493,FIRST BOOK.,"Like sea-weed on the rocks, and suffer her"
494,FIRST BOOK.,"To prick me to a pattern with her pin,"
495,FIRST BOOK.,"Fibre from fibre, delicate leaf from leaf,"
496,FIRST BOOK.,And dry out from my drowned anatomy
497,FIRST BOOK.,The last sea-salt left in me.
498,FIRST BOOK.,So it was.
499,FIRST BOOK.,I broke the copious curls upon my head
500,FIRST BOOK.,"In braids, because she liked smooth-ordered hair."
501,FIRST BOOK.,I left off saying my sweet Tuscan words
502,FIRST BOOK.,Which still at any stirring of the heart
503,FIRST BOOK.,"Came up to float across the English phrase,"
504,FIRST BOOK.,"As lilies, (_Bene_ ... or _che ch’è_) because"
505,FIRST BOOK.,She liked my father’s child to speak his tongue.
506,FIRST BOOK.,"I learnt the collects and the catechism,"
507,FIRST BOOK.,"The creeds, from Athanasius back to Nice,"
508,FIRST BOOK.,"The Articles ... the Tracts _against_ the times,"
509,FIRST BOOK.,"(By no means Buonaventure’s ‘Prick of Love,’)"
510,FIRST BOOK.,And various popular synopses of
511,FIRST BOOK.,"Inhuman doctrines never taught by John,"
512,FIRST BOOK.,Because she liked instructed piety.
513,FIRST BOOK.,I learnt my complement of classic French
514,FIRST BOOK.,"(Kept pure of Balzac and neologism,)"
515,FIRST BOOK.,"And German also, since she liked a range"
516,FIRST BOOK.,"Of liberal education,—tongues, not books."
517,FIRST BOOK.,"I learnt a little algebra, a little"
518,FIRST BOOK.,"Of the mathematics,—brushed with extreme flounce"
519,FIRST BOOK.,"The circle of the sciences, because"
520,FIRST BOOK.,She misliked women who are frivolous.
521,FIRST BOOK.,I learnt the royal genealogies
522,FIRST BOOK.,"Of Oviedo, the internal laws"
523,FIRST BOOK.,"Of the Burmese empire, ... by how many feet"
524,FIRST BOOK.,"Mount Chimborazo outsoars Himmeleh,"
525,FIRST BOOK.,What navigable river joins itself
526,FIRST BOOK.,"To Lara, and what census of the year five"
527,FIRST BOOK.,"Was taken at Klagenfurt,—because she liked"
528,FIRST BOOK.,A general insight into useful facts.
529,FIRST BOOK.,"I learnt much music,—such as would have been"
530,FIRST BOOK.,As quite impossible in Johnson’s day
531,FIRST BOOK.,As still it might be wished—fine sleights of hand
532,FIRST BOOK.,"And unimagined fingering, shuffling off"
533,FIRST BOOK.,The hearer’s soul through hurricanes of notes
534,FIRST BOOK.,To a noisy Tophet; and I drew ... costumes
535,FIRST BOOK.,"From French engravings, nereids neatly draped,"
536,FIRST BOOK.,"With smirks of simmering godship,—I washed in"
537,FIRST BOOK.,"From nature, landscapes, (rather say, washed out.)"
538,FIRST BOOK.,"I danced the polka and Cellarius,"
539,FIRST BOOK.,"Spun glass, stuffed birds, and modelled flowers in wax,"
540,FIRST BOOK.,Because she liked accomplishments in girls.
541,FIRST BOOK.,I read a score of books on womanhood
542,FIRST BOOK.,"To prove, if women do not think at all,"
543,FIRST BOOK.,"They may teach thinking, (to a maiden-aunt"
544,FIRST BOOK.,Or else the author)—books demonstrating
545,FIRST BOOK.,Their right of comprehending husband’s talk
546,FIRST BOOK.,"When not too deep, and even of answering"
547,FIRST BOOK.,"With pretty ‘may it please you,’ or ‘so it is,’—"
548,FIRST BOOK.,"Their rapid insight and fine aptitude,"
549,FIRST BOOK.,"Particular worth and general missionariness,"
550,FIRST BOOK.,As long as they keep quiet by the fire
551,FIRST BOOK.,"And never say ‘no’ when the world says ‘ay,’"
552,FIRST BOOK.,"For that is fatal,—their angelic reach"
553,FIRST BOOK.,"Of virtue, chiefly used to sit and darn,"
554,FIRST BOOK.,"And fatten household sinners,—their, in brief,"
555,FIRST BOOK.,Potential faculty in everything
556,FIRST BOOK.,Of abdicating power in it: she owned
557,FIRST BOOK.,"She liked a woman to be womanly,"
558,FIRST BOOK.,"And English women, she thanked God and sighed,"
559,FIRST BOOK.,(Some people always sigh in thanking God)
560,FIRST BOOK.,Were models to the universe. And last
561,FIRST BOOK.,"I learnt cross-stitch, because she did not like"
562,FIRST BOOK.,"To see me wear the night with empty hands,"
563,FIRST BOOK.,"A-doing nothing. So, my shepherdess"
564,FIRST BOOK.,"Was something after all, (the pastoral saints"
565,FIRST BOOK.,Be praised for’t) leaning lovelorn with pink eyes
566,FIRST BOOK.,"To match her shoes, when I mistook the silks;"
567,FIRST BOOK.,Her head uncrushed by that round weight of hat
568,FIRST BOOK.,So strangely similar to the tortoise-shell
569,FIRST BOOK.,Which slew the tragic poet.
570,FIRST BOOK.,"By the way,"
571,FIRST BOOK.,The works of women are symbolical.
572,FIRST BOOK.,"We sew, sew, prick our fingers, dull our sight,"
573,FIRST BOOK.,"Producing what? A pair of slippers, sir,"
574,FIRST BOOK.,To put on when you’re weary—or a stool
575,FIRST BOOK.,To stumble over and vex you ... ‘curse that stool!’
576,FIRST BOOK.,"Or else at best, a cushion, where you lean"
577,FIRST BOOK.,"And sleep, and dream of something we are not,"
578,FIRST BOOK.,"But would be for your sake. Alas, alas!"
579,FIRST BOOK.,"This hurts most, this ... that, after all, we are paid"
580,FIRST BOOK.,"The worth of our work, perhaps."
581,FIRST BOOK.,In looking down
582,FIRST BOOK.,"Those years of education, (to return)"
583,FIRST BOOK.,I wonder if Brinvilliers suffered more
584,FIRST BOOK.,"In the water-torture, ... flood succeeding flood"
585,FIRST BOOK.,To drench the incapable throat and split the veins ...
586,FIRST BOOK.,Than I did. Certain of your feebler souls
587,FIRST BOOK.,Go out in such a process; many pine
588,FIRST BOOK.,"To a sick, inodorous light; my own endured:"
589,FIRST BOOK.,"I had relations in the Unseen, and drew"
590,FIRST BOOK.,The elemental nutriment and heat
591,FIRST BOOK.,"From nature, as earth feels the sun at nights,"
592,FIRST BOOK.,Or as a babe sucks surely in the dark.
593,FIRST BOOK.,"I kept the life, thrust on me, on the outside"
594,FIRST BOOK.,"Of the inner life, with all its ample room"
595,FIRST BOOK.,"For heart and lungs, for will and intellect,"
596,FIRST BOOK.,"Inviolable by conventions. God,"
597,FIRST BOOK.,I thank thee for that grace of thine!
598,FIRST BOOK.,"At first,"
599,FIRST BOOK.,"I felt no life which was not patience,—did"
600,FIRST BOOK.,"The thing she bade me, without heed to a thing"
601,FIRST BOOK.,"Beyond it, sate in just the chair she placed,"
602,FIRST BOOK.,"With back against the window, to exclude"
603,FIRST BOOK.,"The sight of the great lime-tree on the lawn,"
604,FIRST BOOK.,Which seemed to have come on purpose from the woods
605,FIRST BOOK.,"To bring the house a message,—ay, and walked"
606,FIRST BOOK.,"Demurely in her carpeted low rooms,"
607,FIRST BOOK.,"As if I should not, harkening my own steps,"
608,FIRST BOOK.,"Misdoubt I was alive. I read her books,"
609,FIRST BOOK.,"Was civil to her cousin, Romney Leigh,"
610,FIRST BOOK.,"Gave ear to her vicar, tea to her visitors,"
611,FIRST BOOK.,"And heard them whisper, when I changed a cup,"
612,FIRST BOOK.,"(I blushed for joy at that)—‘The Italian child,"
613,FIRST BOOK.,"For all her blue eyes and her quiet ways,"
614,FIRST BOOK.,Thrives ill in England: she is paler yet
615,FIRST BOOK.,Than when we came the last time; she will die.’
616,FIRST BOOK.,
617,FIRST BOOK.,"‘Will die.’ My cousin, Romney Leigh, blushed too,"
618,FIRST BOOK.,"With sudden anger, and approaching me"
619,FIRST BOOK.,Said low between his teeth—‘You’re wicked now?
620,FIRST BOOK.,You wish to die and leave the world a-dusk
621,FIRST BOOK.,"For others, with your naughty light blown out?’"
622,FIRST BOOK.,I looked into his face defyingly.
623,FIRST BOOK.,"He might have known, that, being what I was,"
624,FIRST BOOK.,’Twas natural to like to get away
625,FIRST BOOK.,As far as dead folk can; and then indeed
626,FIRST BOOK.,Some people make no trouble when they die.
627,FIRST BOOK.,"He turned and went abruptly, slammed the door"
628,FIRST BOOK.,And shut his dog out.
629,FIRST BOOK.,"Romney, Romney Leigh."
630,FIRST BOOK.,"I have not named my cousin hitherto,"
631,FIRST BOOK.,And yet I used him as a sort of friend;
632,FIRST BOOK.,"My elder by few years, but cold and shy"
633,FIRST BOOK.,"And absent ... tender, when he thought of it,"
634,FIRST BOOK.,"Which scarcely was imperative, grave betimes,"
635,FIRST BOOK.,"As well as early master of Leigh Hall,"
636,FIRST BOOK.,Whereof the nightmare sate upon his youth
637,FIRST BOOK.,"Repressing all its seasonable delights,"
638,FIRST BOOK.,And agonising with a ghastly sense
639,FIRST BOOK.,Of universal hideous want and wrong
640,FIRST BOOK.,To incriminate possession. When he came
641,FIRST BOOK.,"From college to the country, very oft"
642,FIRST BOOK.,"He crossed the hills on visits to my aunt,"
643,FIRST BOOK.,"With gifts of blue grapes from the hothouses,"
644,FIRST BOOK.,"A book in one hand,—mere statistics, (if"
645,FIRST BOOK.,I chanced to lift the cover) count of all
646,FIRST BOOK.,"The goats whose beards are sprouting down toward hell,"
647,FIRST BOOK.,Against God’s separating judgment-hour.
648,FIRST BOOK.,"And she, she almost loved him,—even allowed"
649,FIRST BOOK.,That sometimes he should seem to sigh my way;
650,FIRST BOOK.,"It made him easier to be pitiful,"
651,FIRST BOOK.,"And sighing was his gift. So, undisturbed"
652,FIRST BOOK.,At whiles she let him shut my music up
653,FIRST BOOK.,"And push my needles down, and lead me out"
654,FIRST BOOK.,To see in that south angle of the house
655,FIRST BOOK.,"The figs grow black as if by a Tuscan rock,"
656,FIRST BOOK.,On some light pretext. She would turn her head
657,FIRST BOOK.,"At other moments, go to fetch a thing,"
658,FIRST BOOK.,"And leave me breath enough to speak with him,"
659,FIRST BOOK.,For his sake; it was simple.
660,FIRST BOOK.,Sometimes too
661,FIRST BOOK.,"He would have saved me utterly, it seemed,"
662,FIRST BOOK.,He stood and looked so.
663,FIRST BOOK.,"Once, he stood so near"
664,FIRST BOOK.,He dropped a sudden hand upon my head
665,FIRST BOOK.,"Bent down on woman’s work, as soft as rain—"
666,FIRST BOOK.,"But then I rose and shook it off as fire,"
667,FIRST BOOK.,"The stranger’s touch that took my father’s place,"
668,FIRST BOOK.,Yet dared seem soft.
669,FIRST BOOK.,I used him for a friend
670,FIRST BOOK.,Before I ever knew him for a friend.
671,FIRST BOOK.,"’Twas better, ’twas worse also, afterward:"
672,FIRST BOOK.,"We came so close, we saw our differences"
673,FIRST BOOK.,Too intimately. Always Romney Leigh
674,FIRST BOOK.,"Was looking for the worms, I for the gods."
675,FIRST BOOK.,"A godlike nature his; the gods look down,"
676,FIRST BOOK.,Incurious of themselves; and certainly
677,FIRST BOOK.,"’Tis well I should remember, how, those days,"
678,FIRST BOOK.,"I was a worm too, and he looked on me."
679,FIRST BOOK.,
680,FIRST BOOK.,"A little by his act perhaps, yet more"
681,FIRST BOOK.,"By something in me, surely not my will,"
682,FIRST BOOK.,"I did not die. But slowly, as one in swoon,"
683,FIRST BOOK.,"To whom life creeps back in the form of death,"
684,FIRST BOOK.,"With a sense of separation, a blind pain"
685,FIRST BOOK.,"Of blank obstruction, and a roar i’ the ears"
686,FIRST BOOK.,Of visionary chariots which retreat
687,FIRST BOOK.,"As earth grows clearer ... slowly, by degrees,"
688,FIRST BOOK.,"I woke, rose up ... where was I? in the world;"
689,FIRST BOOK.,"For uses, therefore, I must count worth while."
690,FIRST BOOK.,
691,FIRST BOOK.,"I had a little chamber in the house,"
692,FIRST BOOK.,As green as any privet-hedge a bird
693,FIRST BOOK.,"Might choose to build in, though the nest itself"
694,FIRST BOOK.,Could show but dead-brown sticks and straws; the walls
695,FIRST BOOK.,"Were green, the carpet was pure green, the straight"
696,FIRST BOOK.,"Small bed was curtained greenly, and the folds"
697,FIRST BOOK.,"Hung green about the window, which let in"
698,FIRST BOOK.,The out-door world with all its greenery.
699,FIRST BOOK.,You could not push your head out and escape
700,FIRST BOOK.,"A dash of dawn-dew from the honeysuckle,"
701,FIRST BOOK.,But so you were baptised into the grace
702,FIRST BOOK.,And privilege of seeing....
703,FIRST BOOK.,"First, the lime,"
704,FIRST BOOK.,"(I had enough, there, of the lime, be sure,—"
705,FIRST BOOK.,My morning-dream was often hummed away
706,FIRST BOOK.,"By the bees in it;) past the lime, the lawn,"
707,FIRST BOOK.,"Which, after sweeping broadly round the house,"
708,FIRST BOOK.,Went trickling through the shrubberies in a stream
709,FIRST BOOK.,"Of tender turf, and wore and lost itself"
710,FIRST BOOK.,"Among the acacias, over which, you saw"
711,FIRST BOOK.,The irregular line of elms by the deep lane
712,FIRST BOOK.,Which stopped the grounds and dammed the overflow
713,FIRST BOOK.,Of arbutus and laurel. Out of sight
714,FIRST BOOK.,"The lane was; sunk so deep, no foreign tramp"
715,FIRST BOOK.,Nor drover of wild ponies out of Wales
716,FIRST BOOK.,Could guess if lady’s hall or tenant’s lodge
717,FIRST BOOK.,"Dispensed such odours,—though his stick well-crooked"
718,FIRST BOOK.,Might reach the lowest trail of blossoming briar
719,FIRST BOOK.,"Which dipped upon the wall. Behind the elms,"
720,FIRST BOOK.,"And through their tops, you saw the folded hills"
721,FIRST BOOK.,"Striped up and down with hedges, (burly oaks"
722,FIRST BOOK.,Projecting from the lines to show themselves)
723,FIRST BOOK.,Through which my cousin Romney’s chimneys smoked
724,FIRST BOOK.,As still as when a silent mouth in frost
725,FIRST BOOK.,Breathes—showing where the woodlands hid Leigh Hall;
726,FIRST BOOK.,"While, far above, a jut of table-land,"
727,FIRST BOOK.,"A promontory without water, stretched,—"
728,FIRST BOOK.,"You could not catch it if the days were thick,"
729,FIRST BOOK.,"Or took it for a cloud; but, otherwise"
730,FIRST BOOK.,The vigorous sun would catch it up at eve
731,FIRST BOOK.,And use it for an anvil till he had filled
732,FIRST BOOK.,"The shelves of heaven with burning thunderbolts,"
733,FIRST BOOK.,"And proved he need not rest so early:—then,"
734,FIRST BOOK.,When all his setting trouble was resolved
735,FIRST BOOK.,"To a trance of passive glory, you might see"
736,FIRST BOOK.,In apparition on the golden sky
737,FIRST BOOK.,"(Alas, my Giotto’s background!) the sheep run"
738,FIRST BOOK.,"Along the fine clear outline, small as mice"
739,FIRST BOOK.,That run along a witch’s scarlet thread.
740,FIRST BOOK.,
741,FIRST BOOK.,Not a grand nature. Not my chestnut-woods
742,FIRST BOOK.,"Of Vallombrosa, cleaving by the spurs"
743,FIRST BOOK.,To the precipices. Not my headlong leaps
744,FIRST BOOK.,"Of waters, that cry out for joy or fear"
745,FIRST BOOK.,"In leaping through the palpitating pines,"
746,FIRST BOOK.,Like a white soul tossed out to eternity
747,FIRST BOOK.,With thrills of time upon it. Not indeed
748,FIRST BOOK.,"My multitudinous mountains, sitting in"
749,FIRST BOOK.,"The magic circle, with the mutual touch"
750,FIRST BOOK.,"Electric, panting from their full deep hearts"
751,FIRST BOOK.,"Beneath the influent heavens, and waiting for"
752,FIRST BOOK.,Communion and commission. Italy
753,FIRST BOOK.,"Is one thing, England one."
754,FIRST BOOK.,On English ground
755,FIRST BOOK.,"You understand the letter ... ere the fall,"
756,FIRST BOOK.,How Adam lived in a garden. All the fields
757,FIRST BOOK.,"Are tied up fast with hedges, nosegay-like;"
758,FIRST BOOK.,"The hills are crumpled plains,—the plains, parterres,—"
759,FIRST BOOK.,"The trees, round, woolly, ready to be clipped;"
760,FIRST BOOK.,And if you seek for any wilderness
761,FIRST BOOK.,"You find, at best, a park. A nature tamed"
762,FIRST BOOK.,"And grown domestic like a barn-door fowl,"
763,FIRST BOOK.,"Which does not awe you with its claws and beak,"
764,FIRST BOOK.,"Nor tempt you to an eyrie too high up,"
765,FIRST BOOK.,"But which, in cackling, sets you thinking of"
766,FIRST BOOK.,"Your eggs to-morrow at breakfast, in the pause"
767,FIRST BOOK.,Of finer meditation.
768,FIRST BOOK.,"Rather say,"
769,FIRST BOOK.,"A sweet familiar nature, stealing in"
770,FIRST BOOK.,"As a dog might, or child, to touch your hand"
771,FIRST BOOK.,"Or pluck your gown, and humbly mind you so"
772,FIRST BOOK.,"Of presence and affection, excellent"
773,FIRST BOOK.,"For inner uses, from the things without."
774,FIRST BOOK.,
775,FIRST BOOK.,"I could not be unthankful, I who was"
776,FIRST BOOK.,Entreated thus and holpen. In the room
777,FIRST BOOK.,"I speak of, ere the house was well awake,"
778,FIRST BOOK.,"And also after it was well asleep,"
779,FIRST BOOK.,"I sate alone, and drew the blessing in"
780,FIRST BOOK.,"Of all that nature. With a gradual step,"
781,FIRST BOOK.,"A stir among the leaves, a breath, a ray,"
782,FIRST BOOK.,"It came in softly, while the angels made"
783,FIRST BOOK.,"A place for it beside me. The moon came,"
784,FIRST BOOK.,And swept my chamber clean of foolish thoughts.
785,FIRST BOOK.,"The sun came, saying, ‘Shall I lift this light"
786,FIRST BOOK.,"Against the lime-tree, and you will not look?"
787,FIRST BOOK.,"I make the birds sing—listen!... but, for you,"
788,FIRST BOOK.,"God never hears your voice, excepting when"
789,FIRST BOOK.,You lie upon the bed at nights and weep.’
790,FIRST BOOK.,
791,FIRST BOOK.,"Then, something moved me. Then, I wakened up"
792,FIRST BOOK.,"More slowly than I verily write now,"
793,FIRST BOOK.,"But wholly, at last, I wakened, opened wide"
794,FIRST BOOK.,"The window and my soul, and let the airs"
795,FIRST BOOK.,"And out-door sights sweep gradual gospels in,"
796,FIRST BOOK.,"Regenerating what I was. O Life,"
797,FIRST BOOK.,"How oft we throw it off and think,—‘Enough,"
798,FIRST BOOK.,Enough of life in so much!—here’s a cause
799,FIRST BOOK.,"For rupture;—herein we must break with Life,"
800,FIRST BOOK.,"Or be ourselves unworthy; here we are wronged,"
801,FIRST BOOK.,"Maimed, spoiled for aspiration: farewell Life!’"
802,FIRST BOOK.,"—And so, as froward babes, we hide our eyes"
803,FIRST BOOK.,"And think all ended.—Then, Life calls to us"
804,FIRST BOOK.,"In some transformed, apocryphal, new voice,"
805,FIRST BOOK.,"Above us, or below us, or around...."
806,FIRST BOOK.,"Perhaps we name it Nature’s voice, or Love’s,"
807,FIRST BOOK.,"Tricking ourselves, because we are more ashamed"
808,FIRST BOOK.,To own our compensations than our griefs:
809,FIRST BOOK.,"Still, Life’s voice!—still, we make our peace with Life."
810,FIRST BOOK.,
811,FIRST BOOK.,"And I, so young then, was not sullen. Soon"
812,FIRST BOOK.,"I used to get up early, just to sit"
813,FIRST BOOK.,"And watch the morning quicken in the grey,"
814,FIRST BOOK.,"And hear the silence open like a flower,"
815,FIRST BOOK.,"Leaf after leaf,—and stroke with listless hand"
816,FIRST BOOK.,"The woodbine through the window, till at last"
817,FIRST BOOK.,"I came to do it with a sort of love,"
818,FIRST BOOK.,"At foolish unaware: whereat I smiled,—"
819,FIRST BOOK.,"A melancholy smile, to catch myself"
820,FIRST BOOK.,Smiling for joy.
821,FIRST BOOK.,Capacity for joy
822,FIRST BOOK.,"Admits temptation. It seemed, next, worth while"
823,FIRST BOOK.,To dodge the sharp sword set against my life;
824,FIRST BOOK.,"To slip down stairs through all the sleepy house,"
825,FIRST BOOK.,"As mute as any dream there, and escape"
826,FIRST BOOK.,"As a soul from the body, out of doors,—"
827,FIRST BOOK.,"Glide through the shrubberies, drop into the lane,"
828,FIRST BOOK.,"And wander on the hills an hour or two,"
829,FIRST BOOK.,Then back again before the house should stir.
830,FIRST BOOK.,
831,FIRST BOOK.,"Or else I sate on in my chamber green,"
832,FIRST BOOK.,"And lived my life, and thought my thoughts, and prayed"
833,FIRST BOOK.,"My prayers without the vicar; read my books,"
834,FIRST BOOK.,Without considering whether they were fit
835,FIRST BOOK.,"To do me good. Mark, there. We get no good"
836,FIRST BOOK.,"By being ungenerous, even to a book,"
837,FIRST BOOK.,And calculating profits ... so much help
838,FIRST BOOK.,By so much reading. It is rather when
839,FIRST BOOK.,"We gloriously forget ourselves, and plunge"
840,FIRST BOOK.,"Soul-forward, headlong, into a book’s profound,"
841,FIRST BOOK.,Impassioned for its beauty and salt of truth—
842,FIRST BOOK.,’Tis then we get the right good from a book.
843,FIRST BOOK.,
844,FIRST BOOK.,I read much. What my father taught before
845,FIRST BOOK.,"From many a volume, Love re-emphasised"
846,FIRST BOOK.,Upon the self-same pages: Theophrast
847,FIRST BOOK.,"Grew tender with the memory of his eyes,"
848,FIRST BOOK.,And Ælian made mine wet. The trick of Greek
849,FIRST BOOK.,"And Latin, he had taught me, as he would"
850,FIRST BOOK.,Have taught me wrestling or the game of fives
851,FIRST BOOK.,"If such he had known,—most like a shipwrecked man"
852,FIRST BOOK.,Who heaps his single platter with goats’ cheese
853,FIRST BOOK.,And scarlet berries; or like any man
854,FIRST BOOK.,"Who loves but one, and so gives all at once,"
855,FIRST BOOK.,"Because he has it, rather than because"
856,FIRST BOOK.,"He counts it worthy. Thus, my father gave;"
857,FIRST BOOK.,"And thus, as did the women formerly"
858,FIRST BOOK.,"By young Achilles, when they pinned the veil"
859,FIRST BOOK.,"Across the boy’s audacious front, and swept"
860,FIRST BOOK.,"With tuneful laughs the silver-fretted rocks,"
861,FIRST BOOK.,He wrapt his little daughter in his large
862,FIRST BOOK.,"Man’s doublet, careless did it fit or no."
863,FIRST BOOK.,
864,FIRST BOOK.,"But, after I had read for memory,"
865,FIRST BOOK.,I read for hope. The path my father’s foot
866,FIRST BOOK.,"Had trod me out, which suddenly broke off,"
867,FIRST BOOK.,(What time he dropped the wallet of the flesh
868,FIRST BOOK.,"And passed) alone I carried on, and set"
869,FIRST BOOK.,"My child-heart ’gainst the thorny underwood,"
870,FIRST BOOK.,To reach the grassy shelter of the trees.
871,FIRST BOOK.,"Ah, babe i’ the wood, without a brother-babe!"
872,FIRST BOOK.,"My own self-pity, like the red-breast bird,"
873,FIRST BOOK.,Flies back to cover all that past with leaves.
874,FIRST BOOK.,
875,FIRST BOOK.,"Sublimest danger, over which none weeps,"
876,FIRST BOOK.,When any young wayfaring soul goes forth
877,FIRST BOOK.,"Alone, unconscious of the perilous road,"
878,FIRST BOOK.,"The day-sun dazzling in his limpid eyes,"
879,FIRST BOOK.,"To thrust his own way, he an alien, through"
880,FIRST BOOK.,"The world of books! Ah, you!—you think it fine,"
881,FIRST BOOK.,"You clap hands—‘A fair day!’—you cheer him on,"
882,FIRST BOOK.,"As if the worst, could happen, were to rest"
883,FIRST BOOK.,"Too long beside a fountain. Yet, behold,"
884,FIRST BOOK.,Behold!—the world of books is still the world;
885,FIRST BOOK.,And worldlings in it are less merciful
886,FIRST BOOK.,And more puissant. For the wicked there
887,FIRST BOOK.,"Are winged like angels. Every knife that strikes,"
888,FIRST BOOK.,Is edged from elemental fire to assail
889,FIRST BOOK.,A spiritual life. The beautiful seems right
890,FIRST BOOK.,"By force of beauty, and the feeble wrong"
891,FIRST BOOK.,"Because of weakness. Power is justified,"
892,FIRST BOOK.,Though armed against St. Michael. Many a crown
893,FIRST BOOK.,"Covers bald foreheads. In the book-world, true,"
894,FIRST BOOK.,"There’s no lack, neither, of God’s saints and kings,"
895,FIRST BOOK.,That shake the ashes of the grave aside
896,FIRST BOOK.,"From their calm locks, and undiscomfited"
897,FIRST BOOK.,Look stedfast truths against Time’s changing mask.
898,FIRST BOOK.,"True, many a prophet teaches in the roads;"
899,FIRST BOOK.,"True, many a seer pulls down the flaming heavens"
900,FIRST BOOK.,"Upon his own head in strong martyrdom,"
901,FIRST BOOK.,In order to light men a moment’s space.
902,FIRST BOOK.,But stay!—who judges?—who distinguishes
903,FIRST BOOK.,"’Twixt Saul and Nahash justly, at first sight,"
904,FIRST BOOK.,"And leaves king Saul precisely at the sin,"
905,FIRST BOOK.,To serve king David? who discerns at once
906,FIRST BOOK.,"The sound of the trumpets, when the trumpets blow"
907,FIRST BOOK.,For Alaric as well as Charlemagne?
908,FIRST BOOK.,"Who judges prophets, and can tell true seers"
909,FIRST BOOK.,"From conjurors? The child, there? Would you leave"
910,FIRST BOOK.,That child to wander in a battle-field
911,FIRST BOOK.,And push his innocent smile against the guns?
912,FIRST BOOK.,"Or even in the catacombs, ... his torch"
913,FIRST BOOK.,"Grown ragged in the fluttering air, and all"
914,FIRST BOOK.,The dark a-mutter round him? not a child!
915,FIRST BOOK.,
916,FIRST BOOK.,I read books bad and good—some bad and good
917,FIRST BOOK.,At once: good aims not always make good books:
918,FIRST BOOK.,Well-tempered spades turn up ill-smelling soils
919,FIRST BOOK.,"In digging vineyards, even: books, that prove"
920,FIRST BOOK.,"God’s being so definitely, that man’s doubt"
921,FIRST BOOK.,"Grows self-defined the other side the line,"
922,FIRST BOOK.,"Made atheist by suggestion; moral books,"
923,FIRST BOOK.,"Exasperating to license; genial books,"
924,FIRST BOOK.,Discounting from the human dignity;
925,FIRST BOOK.,"And merry books, which set you weeping when"
926,FIRST BOOK.,"The sun shines,—ay, and melancholy books,"
927,FIRST BOOK.,Which make you laugh that any one should weep
928,FIRST BOOK.,"In this disjointed life, for one wrong more."
929,FIRST BOOK.,
930,FIRST BOOK.,"The world of books is still the world, I write,"
931,FIRST BOOK.,"And both worlds have God’s providence, thank God,"
932,FIRST BOOK.,"To keep and hearten: with some struggle, indeed,"
933,FIRST BOOK.,"Among the breakers, some hard swimming through"
934,FIRST BOOK.,"The deeps—I lost breath in my soul sometimes,"
935,FIRST BOOK.,"And cried, ‘God save me if there’s any God,’"
936,FIRST BOOK.,"But, even so, God saved me; and, being dashed"
937,FIRST BOOK.,"From error on to error, every turn"
938,FIRST BOOK.,Still brought me nearer to the central truth.
939,FIRST BOOK.,
940,FIRST BOOK.,I thought so. All this anguish in the thick
941,FIRST BOOK.,"Of men’s opinions ... press and counterpress,"
942,FIRST BOOK.,"Now up, now down, now underfoot, and now"
943,FIRST BOOK.,"Emergent ... all the best of it, perhaps,"
944,FIRST BOOK.,But throws you back upon a noble trust
945,FIRST BOOK.,"And use of your own instinct,—merely proves"
946,FIRST BOOK.,Pure reason stronger than bare inference
947,FIRST BOOK.,"At strongest. Try it,—fix against heaven’s wall"
948,FIRST BOOK.,Your scaling ladders of high logic—mount
949,FIRST BOOK.,Step by step!—Sight goes faster; that still ray
950,FIRST BOOK.,"Which strikes out from you, how, you cannot tell,"
951,FIRST BOOK.,"And why, you know not—(did you eliminate,"
952,FIRST BOOK.,"That such as you, indeed, should analyse?)"
953,FIRST BOOK.,"Goes straight and fast as light, and high as God."
954,FIRST BOOK.,
955,FIRST BOOK.,The cygnet finds the water; but the man
956,FIRST BOOK.,"Is born in ignorance of his element,"
957,FIRST BOOK.,"And feels out blind at first, disorganised"
958,FIRST BOOK.,"By sin i’ the blood,—his spirit-insight dulled"
959,FIRST BOOK.,And crossed by his sensations. Presently
960,FIRST BOOK.,We feel it quicken in the dark sometimes;
961,FIRST BOOK.,"Then, mark, be reverent, be obedient,—"
962,FIRST BOOK.,For those dumb motions of imperfect life
963,FIRST BOOK.,Are oracles of vital Deity
964,FIRST BOOK.,Attesting the Hereafter. Let who says
965,FIRST BOOK.,"‘The soul’s a clean white paper,’ rather say,"
966,FIRST BOOK.,"A palimpsest, a prophet’s holograph"
967,FIRST BOOK.,"Defiled, erased and covered by a monk’s,—"
968,FIRST BOOK.,"The apocalypse, by a Longus! poring on"
969,FIRST BOOK.,"Which obscene text, we may discern perhaps"
970,FIRST BOOK.,"Some fair, fine trace of what was written once,"
971,FIRST BOOK.,Some upstroke of an alpha and omega
972,FIRST BOOK.,Expressing the old scripture.
973,FIRST BOOK.,"Books, books, books!"
974,FIRST BOOK.,I had found the secret of a garret-room
975,FIRST BOOK.,Piled high with cases in my father’s name;
976,FIRST BOOK.,"Piled high, packed large,—where, creeping in and out"
977,FIRST BOOK.,"Among the giant fossils of my past,"
978,FIRST BOOK.,Like some small nimble mouse between the ribs
979,FIRST BOOK.,"Of a mastodon, I nibbled here and there"
980,FIRST BOOK.,"At this or that box, pulling through the gap,"
981,FIRST BOOK.,"In heats of terror, haste, victorious joy,"
982,FIRST BOOK.,The first book first. And how I felt it beat
983,FIRST BOOK.,"Under my pillow, in the morning’s dark,"
984,FIRST BOOK.,An hour before the sun would let me read!
985,FIRST BOOK.,My books!
986,FIRST BOOK.,"At last, because the time was ripe,"
987,FIRST BOOK.,I chanced upon the poets.
988,FIRST BOOK.,As the earth
989,FIRST BOOK.,"Plunges in fury, when the internal fires"
990,FIRST BOOK.,"Have reached and pricked her heart, and, throwing flat"
991,FIRST BOOK.,"The marts and temples, the triumphal gates"
992,FIRST BOOK.,"And towers of observation, clears herself"
993,FIRST BOOK.,"To elemental freedom—thus, my soul,"
994,FIRST BOOK.,"At poetry’s divine first finger-touch,"
995,FIRST BOOK.,"Let go conventions and sprang up surprised,"
996,FIRST BOOK.,Convicted of the great eternities
997,FIRST BOOK.,Before two worlds.
998,FIRST BOOK.,"What’s this, Aurora Leigh,"
999,FIRST BOOK.,"You write so of the poets, and not laugh?"
1000,FIRST BOOK.,"Those virtuous liars, dreamers after dark,"
1001,FIRST BOOK.,"Exaggerators of the sun and moon,"
1002,FIRST BOOK.,And soothsayers in a tea-cup?
1003,FIRST BOOK.,I write so
1004,FIRST BOOK.,"Of the only truth-tellers, now left to God,—"
1005,FIRST BOOK.,"The only speakers of essential truth,"
1006,FIRST BOOK.,"Opposed to relative, comparative,"
1007,FIRST BOOK.,And temporal truths; the only holders by
1008,FIRST BOOK.,"His sun-skirts, through conventional grey glooms;"
1009,FIRST BOOK.,"The only teachers who instruct mankind,"
1010,FIRST BOOK.,"From just a shadow on a charnel-wall,"
1011,FIRST BOOK.,"To find man’s veritable stature out,"
1012,FIRST BOOK.,"Erect, sublime,—the measure of a man,"
1013,FIRST BOOK.,"And that’s the measure of an angel, says"
1014,FIRST BOOK.,"The apostle. Ay, and while your common men"
1015,FIRST BOOK.,"Build pyramids, gauge railroads, reign, reap, dine,"
1016,FIRST BOOK.,And dust the flaunty carpets of the world
1017,FIRST BOOK.,"For kings to walk on, or our senators,"
1018,FIRST BOOK.,The poet suddenly will catch them up
1019,FIRST BOOK.,"With his voice like a thunder ... ‘This is soul,"
1020,FIRST BOOK.,"This is life, this word is being said in heaven,"
1021,FIRST BOOK.,Here’s God down on us! what are you about?’
1022,FIRST BOOK.,"How all those workers start amid their work,"
1023,FIRST BOOK.,"Look round, look up, and feel, a moment’s space,"
1024,FIRST BOOK.,"That carpet-dusting, though a pretty trade,"
1025,FIRST BOOK.,Is not the imperative labour after all.
1026,FIRST BOOK.,
1027,FIRST BOOK.,"My own best poets, am I one with you,"
1028,FIRST BOOK.,"That thus I love you,—or but one through love?"
1029,FIRST BOOK.,Does all this smell of thyme about my feet
1030,FIRST BOOK.,Conclude my visit to your holy hill
1031,FIRST BOOK.,"In personal presence, or but testify"
1032,FIRST BOOK.,The rustling of your vesture through my dreams
1033,FIRST BOOK.,"With influent odours? When my joy and pain,"
1034,FIRST BOOK.,"My thought and aspiration, like the stops"
1035,FIRST BOOK.,"Of pipe or flute, are absolutely dumb"
1036,FIRST BOOK.,"If not melodious, do you play on me,"
1037,FIRST BOOK.,"My pipers,—and if, sooth, you did not blow,"
1038,FIRST BOOK.,"Would no sound come? or is the music mine,"
1039,FIRST BOOK.,"As a man’s voice or breath is called his own,"
1040,FIRST BOOK.,Inbreathed by the Life-breather? There’s a doubt
1041,FIRST BOOK.,For cloudy seasons!
1042,FIRST BOOK.,But the sun was high
1043,FIRST BOOK.,When first I felt my pulses set themselves
1044,FIRST BOOK.,For concords; when the rhythmic turbulence
1045,FIRST BOOK.,"Of blood and brain swept outward upon words,"
1046,FIRST BOOK.,"As wind upon the alders, blanching them"
1047,FIRST BOOK.,By turning up their under-natures till
1048,FIRST BOOK.,They trembled in dilation. O delight
1049,FIRST BOOK.,"And triumph of the poet,—who would say"
1050,FIRST BOOK.,"A man’s mere ‘yes,’ a woman’s common ‘no,’"
1051,FIRST BOOK.,"A little human hope of that or this,"
1052,FIRST BOOK.,And says the word so that it burns you through
1053,FIRST BOOK.,"With a special revelation, shakes the heart"
1054,FIRST BOOK.,"Of all the men and women in the world,"
1055,FIRST BOOK.,"As if one came back from the dead and spoke,"
1056,FIRST BOOK.,"With eyes too happy, a familiar thing"
1057,FIRST BOOK.,Become divine i’ the utterance! while for him
1058,FIRST BOOK.,"The poet, the speaker, he expands with joy;"
1059,FIRST BOOK.,The palpitating angel in his flesh
1060,FIRST BOOK.,Thrills inly with consenting fellowship
1061,FIRST BOOK.,To those innumerous spirits who sun themselves
1062,FIRST BOOK.,Outside of time.
1063,FIRST BOOK.,"O life, O poetry,"
1064,FIRST BOOK.,—Which means life in life! cognisant of life
1065,FIRST BOOK.,"Beyond this blood-beat,—passionate for truth"
1066,FIRST BOOK.,"Beyond these senses,—poetry, my life,—"
1067,FIRST BOOK.,"My eagle, with both grappling feet still hot"
1068,FIRST BOOK.,"From Zeus’s thunder, who has ravished me"
1069,FIRST BOOK.,"Away from all the shepherds, sheep, and dogs,"
1070,FIRST BOOK.,And set me in the Olympian roar and round
1071,FIRST BOOK.,"Of luminous faces, for a cup-bearer,"
1072,FIRST BOOK.,To keep the mouths of all the godheads moist
1073,FIRST BOOK.,"For everlasting laughters,—I, myself,"
1074,FIRST BOOK.,"Half drunk across the beaker, with their eyes!"
1075,FIRST BOOK.,How those gods look!
1076,FIRST BOOK.,"Enough so, Ganymede."
1077,FIRST BOOK.,We shall not bear above a round or two—
1078,FIRST BOOK.,We drop the golden cup at Heré’s foot
1079,FIRST BOOK.,"And swoon back to the earth,—and find ourselves"
1080,FIRST BOOK.,"Face-down among the pine-cones, cold with dew,"
1081,FIRST BOOK.,"While the dogs bark, and many a shepherd scoffs,"
1082,FIRST BOOK.,‘What’s come now to the youth?’ Such ups and downs
1083,FIRST BOOK.,Have poets.
1084,FIRST BOOK.,Am I such indeed? The name
1085,FIRST BOOK.,"Is royal, and to sign it like a queen,"
1086,FIRST BOOK.,"Is what I dare not,—though some royal blood"
1087,FIRST BOOK.,"Would seem to tingle in me now and then,"
1088,FIRST BOOK.,"With sense of power and ache,—with imposthumes"
1089,FIRST BOOK.,And manias usual to the race. Howbeit
1090,FIRST BOOK.,"I dare not: ’tis too easy to go mad,"
1091,FIRST BOOK.,And ape a Bourbon in a crown of straws;
1092,FIRST BOOK.,The thing’s too common.
1093,FIRST BOOK.,Many fervent souls
1094,FIRST BOOK.,"Strike rhyme on rhyme, who would strike steel on steel"
1095,FIRST BOOK.,"If steel had offered, in a restless heat"
1096,FIRST BOOK.,Of doing something. Many tender souls
1097,FIRST BOOK.,"Have strung their losses on a rhyming thread,"
1098,FIRST BOOK.,"As children, cowslips:—the more pains they take,"
1099,FIRST BOOK.,"The work more withers. Young men, ay, and maids,"
1100,FIRST BOOK.,"Too often sow their wild oats in tame verse,"
1101,FIRST BOOK.,Before they sit down under their own vine
1102,FIRST BOOK.,"And live for use. Alas, near all the birds"
1103,FIRST BOOK.,"Will sing at dawn,—and yet we do not take"
1104,FIRST BOOK.,The chaffering swallow for the holy lark.
1105,FIRST BOOK.,
1106,FIRST BOOK.,"In those days, though, I never analysed"
1107,FIRST BOOK.,Myself even. All analysis comes late.
1108,FIRST BOOK.,"You catch a sight of Nature, earliest,"
1109,FIRST BOOK.,"In full front sun-face, and your eyelids wink"
1110,FIRST BOOK.,And drop before the wonder of’t; you miss
1111,FIRST BOOK.,"The form, through seeing the light. I lived, those days,"
1112,FIRST BOOK.,And wrote because I lived—unlicensed else:
1113,FIRST BOOK.,My heart beat in my brain. Life’s violent flood
1114,FIRST BOOK.,"Abolished bounds,—and, which my neighbour’s field,"
1115,FIRST BOOK.,"Which mine, what mattered? It is so in youth."
1116,FIRST BOOK.,We play at leap-frog over the god Term;
1117,FIRST BOOK.,The love within us and the love without
1118,FIRST BOOK.,"Are mixed, confounded; if we are loved or love,"
1119,FIRST BOOK.,"We scarce distinguish. So, with other power."
1120,FIRST BOOK.,Being acted on and acting seem the same:
1121,FIRST BOOK.,"In that first onrush of life’s chariot-wheels,"
1122,FIRST BOOK.,We know not if the forests move or we.
1123,FIRST BOOK.,
1124,FIRST BOOK.,"And so, like most young poets, in a flush"
1125,FIRST BOOK.,"Of individual life, I poured myself"
1126,FIRST BOOK.,"Along the veins of others, and achieved"
1127,FIRST BOOK.,"Mere lifeless imitations of live verse,"
1128,FIRST BOOK.,"And made the living answer for the dead,"
1129,FIRST BOOK.,"Profaning nature. ‘Touch not, do not taste,"
1130,FIRST BOOK.,"Nor handle,’—we’re too legal, who write young:"
1131,FIRST BOOK.,"We beat the phorminx till we hurt our thumbs,"
1132,FIRST BOOK.,As if still ignorant of counterpoint;
1133,FIRST BOOK.,"We call the Muse.... ‘O Muse, benignant Muse!’—"
1134,FIRST BOOK.,As if we had seen her purple-braided head
1135,FIRST BOOK.,"With the eyes in it, start between the boughs"
1136,FIRST BOOK.,"As often as a stag’s. What make-believe,"
1137,FIRST BOOK.,"With so much earnest! what effete results,"
1138,FIRST BOOK.,"From virile efforts! what cold wire-drawn odes,"
1139,FIRST BOOK.,"From such white heats!—bucolics, where the cows"
1140,FIRST BOOK.,Would scare the writer if they splashed the mud
1141,FIRST BOOK.,"In lashing off the flies,—didactics, driven"
1142,FIRST BOOK.,Against the heels of what the master said;
1143,FIRST BOOK.,"And counterfeiting epics, shrill with trumps"
1144,FIRST BOOK.,A babe might blow between two straining cheeks
1145,FIRST BOOK.,"Of bubbled rose, to make his mother laugh;"
1146,FIRST BOOK.,"And elegiac griefs, and songs of love,"
1147,FIRST BOOK.,"Like cast-off nosegays picked up on the road,"
1148,FIRST BOOK.,"The worse for being warm: all these things, writ"
1149,FIRST BOOK.,"On happy mornings, with a morning heart,"
1150,FIRST BOOK.,"That leaps for love, is active for resolve,"
1151,FIRST BOOK.,"Weak for art only. Oft, the ancient forms"
1152,FIRST BOOK.,"Will thrill, indeed, in carrying the young blood."
1153,FIRST BOOK.,"The wine-skins, now and then, a little warped,"
1154,FIRST BOOK.,"Will crack even, as the new wine gurgles in."
1155,FIRST BOOK.,Spare the old bottles!—spill not the new wine.
1156,FIRST BOOK.,
1157,FIRST BOOK.,"By Keats’s soul, the man who never stepped"
1158,FIRST BOOK.,"In gradual progress like another man,"
1159,FIRST BOOK.,"But, turning grandly on his central self,"
1160,FIRST BOOK.,Ensphered himself in twenty perfect years
1161,FIRST BOOK.,"And died, not young,—(the life of a long life,"
1162,FIRST BOOK.,"Distilled to a mere drop, falling like a tear"
1163,FIRST BOOK.,Upon the world’s cold cheek to make it burn
1164,FIRST BOOK.,"For ever;) by that strong excepted soul,"
1165,FIRST BOOK.,"I count it strange, and hard to understand,"
1166,FIRST BOOK.,That nearly all young poets should write old;
1167,FIRST BOOK.,"That Pope was sexagenarian at sixteen,"
1168,FIRST BOOK.,"And beardless Byron academical,"
1169,FIRST BOOK.,"And so with others. It may be, perhaps,"
1170,FIRST BOOK.,Such have not settled long and deep enough
1171,FIRST BOOK.,"In trance, to attain to clairvoyance,—and still"
1172,FIRST BOOK.,"The memory mixes with the vision, spoils,"
1173,FIRST BOOK.,And works it turbid.
1174,FIRST BOOK.,"Or perhaps, again,"
1175,FIRST BOOK.,"In order to discover the Muse-Sphinx,"
1176,FIRST BOOK.,"The melancholy desert must sweep round,"
1177,FIRST BOOK.,"Behind you, as before.—"
1178,FIRST BOOK.,"For me, I wrote"
1179,FIRST BOOK.,"False poems, like the rest, and thought them true,"
1180,FIRST BOOK.,Because myself was true in writing them.
1181,FIRST BOOK.,"I, peradventure, have writ true ones since"
1182,FIRST BOOK.,With less complacence.
1183,FIRST BOOK.,But I could not hide
1184,FIRST BOOK.,My quickening inner life from those at watch.
1185,FIRST BOOK.,"They saw a light at a window now and then,"
1186,FIRST BOOK.,They had not set there. Who had set it there?
1187,FIRST BOOK.,My father’s sister started when she caught
1188,FIRST BOOK.,My soul agaze in my eyes. She could not say
1189,FIRST BOOK.,"I had no business with a sort of soul,"
1190,FIRST BOOK.,"But plainly she objected,—and demurred,"
1191,FIRST BOOK.,That souls were dangerous things to carry straight
1192,FIRST BOOK.,Through all the spilt saltpetre of the world.
1193,FIRST BOOK.,
1194,FIRST BOOK.,"She said sometimes, ‘Aurora, have you done"
1195,FIRST BOOK.,Your task this morning?—have you read that book?
1196,FIRST BOOK.,And are you ready for the crochet here?’—
1197,FIRST BOOK.,"As if she said, ‘I know there’s something wrong;"
1198,FIRST BOOK.,I know I have not ground you down enough
1199,FIRST BOOK.,To flatten and bake you to a wholesome crust
1200,FIRST BOOK.,"For household uses and proprieties,"
1201,FIRST BOOK.,Before the rain has got into my barn
1202,FIRST BOOK.,"And set the grains a-sprouting. What, you’re green"
1203,FIRST BOOK.,With out-door impudence? you almost grow?’
1204,FIRST BOOK.,"To which I answered, ‘Would she hear my task,"
1205,FIRST BOOK.,And verify my abstract of the book?
1206,FIRST BOOK.,And should I sit down to the crochet work?
1207,FIRST BOOK.,Was such her pleasure?’ ... Then I sate and teased
1208,FIRST BOOK.,"The patient needle till it spilt the thread,"
1209,FIRST BOOK.,Which oozed off from it in meandering lace
1210,FIRST BOOK.,"From hour to hour. I was not, therefore, sad;"
1211,FIRST BOOK.,My soul was singing at a work apart
1212,FIRST BOOK.,"Behind the wall of sense, as safe from harm"
1213,FIRST BOOK.,"As sings the lark when sucked up out of sight,"
1214,FIRST BOOK.,In vortices of glory and blue air.
1215,FIRST BOOK.,
1216,FIRST BOOK.,"And so, through forced work and spontaneous work,"
1217,FIRST BOOK.,"The inner life informed the outer life,"
1218,FIRST BOOK.,"Reduced the irregular blood to settled rhythms,"
1219,FIRST BOOK.,"Made cool the forehead with fresh-sprinkling dreams,"
1220,FIRST BOOK.,"And, rounding to the spheric soul the thin"
1221,FIRST BOOK.,"Pined body, struck a colour up the cheeks,"
1222,FIRST BOOK.,Though somewhat faint. I clenched my brows across
1223,FIRST BOOK.,"My blue eyes greatening in the looking-glass,"
1224,FIRST BOOK.,"And said, ‘We’ll live, Aurora! we’ll be strong."
1225,FIRST BOOK.,The dogs are on us—but we will not die.’
1226,FIRST BOOK.,
1227,FIRST BOOK.,"Whoever lives true life, will love true love."
1228,FIRST BOOK.,"I learnt to love that England. Very oft,"
1229,FIRST BOOK.,"Before the day was born, or otherwise"
1230,FIRST BOOK.,"Through secret windings of the afternoons,"
1231,FIRST BOOK.,I threw my hunters off and plunged myself
1232,FIRST BOOK.,"Among the deep hills, as a hunted stag"
1233,FIRST BOOK.,"Will take the waters, shivering with the fear"
1234,FIRST BOOK.,"And passion of the course. And when, at last"
1235,FIRST BOOK.,"Escaped,—so many a green slope built on slope"
1236,FIRST BOOK.,"Betwixt me and the enemy’s house behind,"
1237,FIRST BOOK.,"I dared to rest, or wander,—like a rest"
1238,FIRST BOOK.,"Made sweeter for the step upon the grass,—"
1239,FIRST BOOK.,"And view the ground’s most gentle dimplement,"
1240,FIRST BOOK.,(As if God’s finger touched but did not press
1241,FIRST BOOK.,In making England!) such an up and down
1242,FIRST BOOK.,"Of verdure,—nothing too much up or down,"
1243,FIRST BOOK.,"A ripple of land; such little hills, the sky"
1244,FIRST BOOK.,Can stoop to tenderly and the wheatfields climb;
1245,FIRST BOOK.,"Such nooks of valleys, lined with orchises,"
1246,FIRST BOOK.,Fed full of noises by invisible streams;
1247,FIRST BOOK.,"And open pastures, where you scarcely tell"
1248,FIRST BOOK.,"White daisies from white dew,—at intervals"
1249,FIRST BOOK.,The mythic oaks and elm-trees standing out
1250,FIRST BOOK.,"Self-poised upon their prodigy of shade,—"
1251,FIRST BOOK.,I thought my father’s land was worthy too
1252,FIRST BOOK.,Of being my Shakspeare’s.
1253,FIRST BOOK.,"Very oft alone,"
1254,FIRST BOOK.,Unlicensed; not unfrequently with leave
1255,FIRST BOOK.,To walk the third with Romney and his friend
1256,FIRST BOOK.,"The rising painter, Vincent Carrington,"
1257,FIRST BOOK.,"Whom men judge hardly, as bee-bonnetted,"
1258,FIRST BOOK.,"Because he holds that, paint a body well,"
1259,FIRST BOOK.,"You paint a soul by implication, like"
1260,FIRST BOOK.,The grand first Master. Pleasant walks! for if
1261,FIRST BOOK.,He said ... ‘When I was last in Italy’ ...
1262,FIRST BOOK.,It sounded as an instrument that’s played
1263,FIRST BOOK.,Too far off for the tune—and yet it’s fine
1264,FIRST BOOK.,To listen.
1265,FIRST BOOK.,"Ofter we walked only two,"
1266,FIRST BOOK.,If cousin Romney pleased to walk with me.
1267,FIRST BOOK.,"We read, or talked, or quarrelled, as it chanced:"
1268,FIRST BOOK.,"We were not lovers, nor even friends well-matched—"
1269,FIRST BOOK.,"Say rather, scholars upon different tracks,"
1270,FIRST BOOK.,"And thinkers disagreed; he, overfull"
1271,FIRST BOOK.,"Of what is, and I, haply, overbold"
1272,FIRST BOOK.,For what might be.
1273,FIRST BOOK.,"But then the thrushes sang,"
1274,FIRST BOOK.,"And shook my pulses and the elms’ new leaves,—"
1275,FIRST BOOK.,"And then I turned, and held my finger up,"
1276,FIRST BOOK.,"And bade him mark that, howsoe’er the world"
1277,FIRST BOOK.,"Went ill, as he related, certainly"
1278,FIRST BOOK.,The thrushes still sang in it.—At which word
1279,FIRST BOOK.,"His brow would soften,—and he bore with me"
1280,FIRST BOOK.,"In melancholy patience, not unkind,"
1281,FIRST BOOK.,"While, breaking into voluble ecstacy,"
1282,FIRST BOOK.,"I flattered all the beauteous country round,"
1283,FIRST BOOK.,"As poets use ... the skies, the clouds, the fields,"
1284,FIRST BOOK.,The happy violets hiding from the roads
1285,FIRST BOOK.,"The primroses run down to, carrying gold,—"
1286,FIRST BOOK.,"The tangled hedgerows, where the cows push out"
1287,FIRST BOOK.,Impatient horns and tolerant churning mouths
1288,FIRST BOOK.,"’Twixt dripping ash-boughs,—hedgerows all alive"
1289,FIRST BOOK.,With birds and gnats and large white butterflies
1290,FIRST BOOK.,Which look as if the May-flower had caught life
1291,FIRST BOOK.,"And palpitated forth upon the wind,—"
1292,FIRST BOOK.,"Hills, vales, woods, netted in a silver mist,"
1293,FIRST BOOK.,"Farms, granges, doubled up among the hills,"
1294,FIRST BOOK.,"And cattle grazing in the watered vales,"
1295,FIRST BOOK.,"And cottage-chimneys smoking from the woods,"
1296,FIRST BOOK.,"And cottage-gardens smelling everywhere,"
1297,FIRST BOOK.,"Confused with smell of orchards. ‘See,’ I said,"
1298,FIRST BOOK.,‘And see! is God not with us on the earth?
1299,FIRST BOOK.,And shall we put Him down by aught we do?
1300,FIRST BOOK.,Who says there’s nothing for the poor and vile
1301,FIRST BOOK.,Save poverty and wickedness? behold!’
1302,FIRST BOOK.,"And ankle-deep in English grass I leaped,"
1303,FIRST BOOK.,"And clapped my hands, and called all very fair."
1304,FIRST BOOK.,
1305,FIRST BOOK.,"In the beginning when God called all good,"
1306,FIRST BOOK.,"Even then, was evil near us, it is writ."
1307,FIRST BOOK.,"But we, indeed, who call things good and fair,"
1308,FIRST BOOK.,The evil is upon us while we speak;
1309,FIRST BOOK.,"Deliver us from evil, let us pray."
1310,FIRST BOOK.,
1311,FIRST BOOK.,
1312,FIRST BOOK.,
1313,FIRST BOOK.,
1314,SECOND BOOK.,SECOND BOOK.
1315,SECOND BOOK.,
1316,SECOND BOOK.,
1317,SECOND BOOK.,TIMES followed one another. Came a morn
1318,SECOND BOOK.,"I stood upon the brink of twenty years,"
1319,SECOND BOOK.,"And looked before and after, as I stood"
1320,SECOND BOOK.,"Woman and artist,—either incomplete,"
1321,SECOND BOOK.,Both credulous of completion. There I held
1322,SECOND BOOK.,"The whole creation in my little cup,"
1323,SECOND BOOK.,"And smiled with thirsty lips before I drank,"
1324,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Good health to you and me, sweet neighbour mine,"
1325,SECOND BOOK.,And all these peoples.’
1326,SECOND BOOK.,"I was glad, that day;"
1327,SECOND BOOK.,"The June was in me, with its multitudes"
1328,SECOND BOOK.,"Of nightingales all singing in the dark,"
1329,SECOND BOOK.,And rosebuds reddening where the calyx split.
1330,SECOND BOOK.,"I felt so young, so strong, so sure of God!"
1331,SECOND BOOK.,"So glad, I could not choose be very wise!"
1332,SECOND BOOK.,"And, old at twenty, was inclined to pull"
1333,SECOND BOOK.,My childhood backward in a childish jest
1334,SECOND BOOK.,"To see the face of’t once more, and farewell!"
1335,SECOND BOOK.,In which fantastic mood I bounded forth
1336,SECOND BOOK.,"At early morning,—would not wait so long"
1337,SECOND BOOK.,"As even to snatch my bonnet by the strings,"
1338,SECOND BOOK.,"But, brushing a green trail across the lawn"
1339,SECOND BOOK.,"With my gown in the dew, took will and way"
1340,SECOND BOOK.,"Among the acacias of the shrubberies,"
1341,SECOND BOOK.,To fly my fancies in the open air
1342,SECOND BOOK.,"And keep my birthday, till my aunt awoke"
1343,SECOND BOOK.,"To stop good dreams. Meanwhile I murmured on,"
1344,SECOND BOOK.,As honeyed bees keep humming to themselves;
1345,SECOND BOOK.,‘The worthiest poets have remained uncrowned
1346,SECOND BOOK.,"Till death has bleached their foreheads to the bone,"
1347,SECOND BOOK.,"And so with me it must be, unless I prove"
1348,SECOND BOOK.,"Unworthy of the grand adversity,—"
1349,SECOND BOOK.,And certainly I would not fail so much.
1350,SECOND BOOK.,"What, therefore, if I crown myself to-day"
1351,SECOND BOOK.,"In sport, not pride, to learn the feel of it,"
1352,SECOND BOOK.,Before my brows be numb as Dante’s own
1353,SECOND BOOK.,To all the tender pricking of such leaves?
1354,SECOND BOOK.,Such leaves! what leaves?’
1355,SECOND BOOK.,"I pulled the branches down,"
1356,SECOND BOOK.,To choose from.
1357,SECOND BOOK.,‘Not the bay! I choose no bay;
1358,SECOND BOOK.,The fates deny us if we are overbold:
1359,SECOND BOOK.,Nor myrtle—which means chiefly love; and love
1360,SECOND BOOK.,Is something awful which one dares not touch
1361,SECOND BOOK.,So early o’ mornings. This verbena strains
1362,SECOND BOOK.,"The point of passionate fragrance; and hard by,"
1363,SECOND BOOK.,"This guelder-rose, at far too slight a beck"
1364,SECOND BOOK.,"Of the wind, will toss about her flower-apples."
1365,SECOND BOOK.,"Ah—there’s my choice,—that ivy on the wall,"
1366,SECOND BOOK.,That headlong ivy! not a leaf will grow
1367,SECOND BOOK.,"But thinking of a wreath. Large leaves, smooth leaves,"
1368,SECOND BOOK.,"Serrated like my vines, and half as green."
1369,SECOND BOOK.,I like such ivy; bold to leap a height
1370,SECOND BOOK.,’Twas strong to climb! as good to grow on graves
1371,SECOND BOOK.,"As twist about a thyrsus; pretty too,"
1372,SECOND BOOK.,"(And that’s not ill) when twisted round a comb,’"
1373,SECOND BOOK.,
1374,SECOND BOOK.,"Thus speaking to myself, half singing it,"
1375,SECOND BOOK.,Because some thoughts are fashioned like a bell
1376,SECOND BOOK.,"To ring with once being touched, I drew a wreath"
1377,SECOND BOOK.,"Drenched, blinding me with dew, across my brow,"
1378,SECOND BOOK.,"And fastening it behind so, ... turning faced"
1379,SECOND BOOK.,... My public!—cousin Romney—with a mouth
1380,SECOND BOOK.,Twice graver than his eyes.
1381,SECOND BOOK.,I stood there fixed—
1382,SECOND BOOK.,"My arms up, like the caryatid, sole"
1383,SECOND BOOK.,"Of some abolished temple, helplessly"
1384,SECOND BOOK.,Persistent in a gesture which derides
1385,SECOND BOOK.,"A former purpose. Yet my blush was flame,"
1386,SECOND BOOK.,"As if from flax, not stone."
1387,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Aurora Leigh,"
1388,SECOND BOOK.,The earliest of Auroras!’
1389,SECOND BOOK.,Hand stretched out
1390,SECOND BOOK.,"I clasped, as shipwrecked men will clasp a hand,"
1391,SECOND BOOK.,Indifferent to the sort of palm. The tide
1392,SECOND BOOK.,"Had caught me at my pastime, writing down"
1393,SECOND BOOK.,My foolish name too near upon the sea
1394,SECOND BOOK.,"Which drowned me with a blush as foolish. ‘You,"
1395,SECOND BOOK.,My cousin!’
1396,SECOND BOOK.,The smile died out in his eyes
1397,SECOND BOOK.,"And dropped upon his lips, a cold dead weight,"
1398,SECOND BOOK.,"For just a moment.... ‘Here’s a book, I found!"
1399,SECOND BOOK.,"No name writ on it—poems, by the form;"
1400,SECOND BOOK.,"Some Greek upon the margin,—lady’s Greek,"
1401,SECOND BOOK.,Without the accents. Read it? Not a word.
1402,SECOND BOOK.,I saw at once the thing had witchcraft in’t
1403,SECOND BOOK.,Whereof the reading calls up dangerous spirits;
1404,SECOND BOOK.,I rather bring it to the witch.’
1405,SECOND BOOK.,‘My book!
1406,SECOND BOOK.,You found it‘....
1407,SECOND BOOK.,"‘In the hollow by the stream,"
1408,SECOND BOOK.,"That beech leans down into—of which you said,"
1409,SECOND BOOK.,The Oread in it has a Naiad’s heart
1410,SECOND BOOK.,And pines for waters.’
1411,SECOND BOOK.,‘Thank you.’
1412,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Rather _you_,"
1413,SECOND BOOK.,My cousin! that I have seen you not too much
1414,SECOND BOOK.,"A witch, a poet, scholar, and the rest,"
1415,SECOND BOOK.,To be a woman also.’
1416,SECOND BOOK.,With a glance
1417,SECOND BOOK.,"The smile rose in his eyes again, and touched"
1418,SECOND BOOK.,"The ivy on my forehead, light as air."
1419,SECOND BOOK.,"I answered gravely, ‘Poets needs must be"
1420,SECOND BOOK.,Or men or women—more’s the pity.’
1421,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Ah,"
1422,SECOND BOOK.,"But men, and still less women, happily,"
1423,SECOND BOOK.,"Scarce need be poets. Keep to the green wreath,"
1424,SECOND BOOK.,Since even dreaming of the stone and bronze
1425,SECOND BOOK.,"Brings headaches, pretty cousin, and defiles"
1426,SECOND BOOK.,The clean white morning dresses.’
1427,SECOND BOOK.,‘So you judge!
1428,SECOND BOOK.,"Because I love the beautiful, I must"
1429,SECOND BOOK.,"Love pleasure chiefly, and be overcharged"
1430,SECOND BOOK.,"For ease and whiteness! Well—you know the world,"
1431,SECOND BOOK.,And only miss your cousin; ’tis not much!—
1432,SECOND BOOK.,But learn this: I would rather take my part
1433,SECOND BOOK.,"With God’s Dead, who afford to walk in white"
1434,SECOND BOOK.,"Yet spread His glory, than keep quiet here,"
1435,SECOND BOOK.,"And gather up my feet from even a step,"
1436,SECOND BOOK.,For fear to soil my gown in so much dust.
1437,SECOND BOOK.,"I choose to walk at all risks.—Here, if heads"
1438,SECOND BOOK.,"That hold a rhythmic thought, must ache perforce,"
1439,SECOND BOOK.,"For my part, I choose headaches,—and today’s"
1440,SECOND BOOK.,My birthday.’
1441,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Dear Aurora, choose instead"
1442,SECOND BOOK.,To cure such. You have balsams.’
1443,SECOND BOOK.,‘I perceive!—
1444,SECOND BOOK.,The headache is too noble for my sex.
1445,SECOND BOOK.,"You think the heartache would sound decenter,"
1446,SECOND BOOK.,"Since that’s the woman’s special, proper ache,"
1447,SECOND BOOK.,"And altogether tolerable, except"
1448,SECOND BOOK.,To a woman.’
1449,SECOND BOOK.,"Saying which, I loosed my wreath,"
1450,SECOND BOOK.,"And, swinging it beside me as I walked,"
1451,SECOND BOOK.,"Half petulant, half playful, as we walked,"
1452,SECOND BOOK.,"I sent a sidelong look to find his thought,—"
1453,SECOND BOOK.,"As falcon set on falconer’s finger may,"
1454,SECOND BOOK.,"With sidelong head, and startled, braving eye,"
1455,SECOND BOOK.,"Which means, ‘You’ll see—you’ll see! I’ll soon take flight—"
1456,SECOND BOOK.,"You shall not hinder.’ He, as shaking out"
1457,SECOND BOOK.,"His hand and answering ‘Fly then,’ did not speak,"
1458,SECOND BOOK.,Except by such a gesture. Silently
1459,SECOND BOOK.,"We paced, until, just coming into sight"
1460,SECOND BOOK.,"Of the house-windows, he abruptly caught"
1461,SECOND BOOK.,"At one end of the swinging wreath, and said"
1462,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Aurora!’ There I stopped short, breath and all."
1463,SECOND BOOK.,
1464,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Aurora, let’s be serious, and throw by"
1465,SECOND BOOK.,"This game of head and heart. Life means, be sure,"
1466,SECOND BOOK.,"Both heart and head,—both active, both complete,"
1467,SECOND BOOK.,And both in earnest. Men and women make
1468,SECOND BOOK.,"The world, as head and heart make human life."
1469,SECOND BOOK.,"Work man, work woman, since there’s work to do"
1470,SECOND BOOK.,"In this beleaguered earth, for head and heart,"
1471,SECOND BOOK.,And thought can never do the work of love!
1472,SECOND BOOK.,"But work for ends, I mean for uses; not"
1473,SECOND BOOK.,For such sleek fringes (do you call them ends?
1474,SECOND BOOK.,Still less God’s glory) as we sew ourselves
1475,SECOND BOOK.,Upon the velvet of those baldaquins
1476,SECOND BOOK.,"Held ’twixt us and the sun. That book of yours,"
1477,SECOND BOOK.,I have not read a page of; but I toss
1478,SECOND BOOK.,"A rose up—it falls calyx down, you see!..."
1479,SECOND BOOK.,"The chances are that, being a woman, young,"
1480,SECOND BOOK.,"And pure, with such a pair of large, calm eyes, ..."
1481,SECOND BOOK.,"You write as well ... and ill ... upon the whole,"
1482,SECOND BOOK.,"As other women. If as well, what then?"
1483,SECOND BOOK.,"If even a little better, ... still, what then?"
1484,SECOND BOOK.,"We want the Best in art now, or no art."
1485,SECOND BOOK.,The time is done for facile settings up
1486,SECOND BOOK.,"Of minnow gods, nymphs here, and tritons there;"
1487,SECOND BOOK.,"The polytheists have gone out in God,"
1488,SECOND BOOK.,"That unity of Bests. No best, no God!—"
1489,SECOND BOOK.,"And so with art, we say. Give art’s divine,"
1490,SECOND BOOK.,"Direct, indubitable, real as grief,—"
1491,SECOND BOOK.,Or leave us to the grief we grow ourselves
1492,SECOND BOOK.,Divine by overcoming with mere hope
1493,SECOND BOOK.,"And most prosaic patience. You, you are young"
1494,SECOND BOOK.,As Eve with nature’s daybreak on her face;
1495,SECOND BOOK.,"But this same world you are come to, dearest coz,"
1496,SECOND BOOK.,"Has done with keeping birthdays, saves her wreaths"
1497,SECOND BOOK.,"To hang upon her ruins,—and forgets"
1498,SECOND BOOK.,To rhyme the cry with which she still beats back
1499,SECOND BOOK.,"Those savage, hungry dogs that hunt her down"
1500,SECOND BOOK.,To the empty grave of Christ. The world’s hard pressed;
1501,SECOND BOOK.,The sweat of labour in the early curse
1502,SECOND BOOK.,Has (turning acrid in six thousand years)
1503,SECOND BOOK.,"Become the sweat of torture. Who has time,"
1504,SECOND BOOK.,An hour’s time ... think!... to sit upon a bank
1505,SECOND BOOK.,And hear the cymbal tinkle in white hands?
1506,SECOND BOOK.,"When Egypt’s slain, I say, let Miriam sing!—"
1507,SECOND BOOK.,Before ... where’s Moses?’
1508,SECOND BOOK.,‘Ah—exactly that!
1509,SECOND BOOK.,Where’s Moses?—is a Moses to be found?—
1510,SECOND BOOK.,"You’ll seek him vainly in the bulrushes,"
1511,SECOND BOOK.,"While I in vain touch cymbals. Yet, concede,"
1512,SECOND BOOK.,"Such sounding brass has done some actual good,"
1513,SECOND BOOK.,"(The application in a woman’s hand,"
1514,SECOND BOOK.,"If that were credible, being scarcely spoilt,)"
1515,SECOND BOOK.,In colonising beehives.’
1516,SECOND BOOK.,‘There it is!—
1517,SECOND BOOK.,"You play beside a death-bed like a child,"
1518,SECOND BOOK.,Yet measure to yourself a prophet’s place
1519,SECOND BOOK.,"To teach the living. None of all these things,"
1520,SECOND BOOK.,Can women understand. You generalise
1521,SECOND BOOK.,"Oh, nothing!—not even grief! Your quick-breathed hearts,"
1522,SECOND BOOK.,"So sympathetic to the personal pang,"
1523,SECOND BOOK.,"Close, on each separate knife-stroke, yielding up"
1524,SECOND BOOK.,A whole life at each wound; incapable
1525,SECOND BOOK.,"Of deepening, widening a large lap of life"
1526,SECOND BOOK.,To hold the world-full woe. The human race
1527,SECOND BOOK.,"To you means, such a child, or such a man,"
1528,SECOND BOOK.,"You saw one morning waiting in the cold,"
1529,SECOND BOOK.,"Beside that gate, perhaps. You gather up"
1530,SECOND BOOK.,"A few such cases, and, when strong, sometimes"
1531,SECOND BOOK.,"Will write of factories and of slaves, as if"
1532,SECOND BOOK.,"Your father were a negro, and your son"
1533,SECOND BOOK.,"A spinner in the mills. All’s yours and you,—"
1534,SECOND BOOK.,"All, coloured with your blood, or otherwise"
1535,SECOND BOOK.,"Just nothing to you. Why, I call you hard"
1536,SECOND BOOK.,To general suffering. Here’s the world half blind
1537,SECOND BOOK.,"With intellectual light, half brutalised"
1538,SECOND BOOK.,"With civilisation, having caught the plague"
1539,SECOND BOOK.,"In silks from Tarsus, shrieking east and west"
1540,SECOND BOOK.,"Along a thousand railroads, mad with pain"
1541,SECOND BOOK.,"And sin too!... does one woman of you all,"
1542,SECOND BOOK.,(You who weep easily) grow pale to see
1543,SECOND BOOK.,This tiger shake his cage?—does one of you
1544,SECOND BOOK.,"Stand still from dancing, stop from stringing pearls,"
1545,SECOND BOOK.,"And pine and die, because of the great sum"
1546,SECOND BOOK.,Of universal anguish?—Show me a tear
1547,SECOND BOOK.,"Wet as Cordelia’s, in eyes bright as yours,"
1548,SECOND BOOK.,"Because the world is mad! You cannot count,"
1549,SECOND BOOK.,"That you should weep for this account, not you!"
1550,SECOND BOOK.,You weep for what you know. A red-haired child
1551,SECOND BOOK.,"Sick in a fever, if you touch him once,"
1552,SECOND BOOK.,"Though but so little as with a finger-tip,"
1553,SECOND BOOK.,Will set you weeping; but a million sick ...
1554,SECOND BOOK.,"You could as soon weep for the rule of three,"
1555,SECOND BOOK.,"Or compound fractions. Therefore, this same world"
1556,SECOND BOOK.,"Uncomprehended by you, must remain"
1557,SECOND BOOK.,"Uninfluenced by you.—Women as you are,"
1558,SECOND BOOK.,"Mere women, personal and passionate,"
1559,SECOND BOOK.,"You give us doating mothers, and chaste wives,"
1560,SECOND BOOK.,"Sublime Madonnas, and enduring saints!"
1561,SECOND BOOK.,"We get no Christ from you,—and verily"
1562,SECOND BOOK.,"We shall not get a poet, in my mind.’"
1563,SECOND BOOK.,
1564,SECOND BOOK.,‘With which conclusion you conclude’....
1565,SECOND BOOK.,‘But this—
1566,SECOND BOOK.,"That you, Aurora, with the large live brow"
1567,SECOND BOOK.,"And steady eyelids, cannot condescend"
1568,SECOND BOOK.,"To play at art, as children play at swords,"
1569,SECOND BOOK.,"To show a pretty spirit, chiefly admired"
1570,SECOND BOOK.,Because true action is impossible.
1571,SECOND BOOK.,You never can be satisfied with praise
1572,SECOND BOOK.,Which men give women when they judge a book
1573,SECOND BOOK.,"Not as mere work, but as mere woman’s work,"
1574,SECOND BOOK.,Expressing the comparative respect
1575,SECOND BOOK.,"Which means the absolute scorn. ‘Oh, excellent!"
1576,SECOND BOOK.,What grace! what facile turns! what fluent sweeps!
1577,SECOND BOOK.,What delicate discernment ... almost thought!
1578,SECOND BOOK.,"The book does honour to the sex, we hold."
1579,SECOND BOOK.,Among our female authors we make room
1580,SECOND BOOK.,"For this fair writer, and congratulate"
1581,SECOND BOOK.,The country that produces in these times
1582,SECOND BOOK.,"Such women, competent to ... spell.’"
1583,SECOND BOOK.,‘Stop there!’
1584,SECOND BOOK.,I answered—burning through his thread of talk
1585,SECOND BOOK.,"With a quick flame of emotion,—‘You have read"
1586,SECOND BOOK.,"My soul, if not my book, and argue well"
1587,SECOND BOOK.,I would not condescend ... we will not say
1588,SECOND BOOK.,"To such a kind of praise, (a worthless end"
1589,SECOND BOOK.,Is praise of all kinds) but to such a use
1590,SECOND BOOK.,"Of holy art and golden life. I am young,"
1591,SECOND BOOK.,And peradventure weak—you tell me so—
1592,SECOND BOOK.,"Through being a woman. And, for all the rest,"
1593,SECOND BOOK.,Take thanks for justice. I would rather dance
1594,SECOND BOOK.,"At fairs on tight-rope, till the babies dropped"
1595,SECOND BOOK.,"Their gingerbread for joy,—than shift the types"
1596,SECOND BOOK.,"For tolerable verse, intolerable"
1597,SECOND BOOK.,"To men who act and suffer. Better far,"
1598,SECOND BOOK.,"Pursue a frivolous trade by serious means,"
1599,SECOND BOOK.,Than a sublime art frivolously.’
1600,SECOND BOOK.,"‘You,"
1601,SECOND BOOK.,"Choose nobler work than either, O moist eyes,"
1602,SECOND BOOK.,"And hurrying lips, and heaving heart! We are young"
1603,SECOND BOOK.,"Aurora, you and I. The world ... look round ..."
1604,SECOND BOOK.,"The world, we’re come to late, is swollen hard"
1605,SECOND BOOK.,With perished generations and their sins:
1606,SECOND BOOK.,The civiliser’s spade grinds horribly
1607,SECOND BOOK.,"On dead men’s bones, and cannot turn up soil"
1608,SECOND BOOK.,That’s otherwise than fetid. All success
1609,SECOND BOOK.,Proves partial failure; all advance implies
1610,SECOND BOOK.,"What’s left behind; all triumph, something crushed"
1611,SECOND BOOK.,"At the chariot-wheels; all government, some wrong:"
1612,SECOND BOOK.,"And rich men make the poor, who curse the rich,"
1613,SECOND BOOK.,"Who agonise together, rich and poor,"
1614,SECOND BOOK.,"Under and over, in the social spasm"
1615,SECOND BOOK.,"And crisis of the ages. Here’s an age,"
1616,SECOND BOOK.,"That makes its own vocation! here, we have stepped"
1617,SECOND BOOK.,"Across the bounds of time! here’s nought to see,"
1618,SECOND BOOK.,"But just the rich man and just Lazarus,"
1619,SECOND BOOK.,"And both in torments; with a mediate gulph,"
1620,SECOND BOOK.,"Though not a hint of Abraham’s bosom. Who,"
1621,SECOND BOOK.,"Being man and human, can stand calmly by"
1622,SECOND BOOK.,"And view these things, and never tease his soul"
1623,SECOND BOOK.,"For some great cure? No physic for this grief,"
1624,SECOND BOOK.,In all the earth and heavens too?’
1625,SECOND BOOK.,‘You believe
1626,SECOND BOOK.,"In God, for your part?—ay? that He who makes,"
1627,SECOND BOOK.,"Can make good things from ill things, best from worst,"
1628,SECOND BOOK.,As men plant tulips upon dunghills when
1629,SECOND BOOK.,They wish them finest?’
1630,SECOND BOOK.,‘True. A death-heat is
1631,SECOND BOOK.,"The same as life-heat, to be accurate;"
1632,SECOND BOOK.,"And in all nature is no death at all,"
1633,SECOND BOOK.,"As men account of death, as long as God"
1634,SECOND BOOK.,"Stands witnessing for life perpetually,"
1635,SECOND BOOK.,"By being just God. That’s abstract truth, I know,"
1636,SECOND BOOK.,"Philosophy, or sympathy with God:"
1637,SECOND BOOK.,"But I, I sympathise with man, not God,"
1638,SECOND BOOK.,I think I was a man for chiefly this;
1639,SECOND BOOK.,"And when I stand beside a dying bed,"
1640,SECOND BOOK.,"It’s death to me. Observe,—it had not much"
1641,SECOND BOOK.,Consoled the race of mastodons to know
1642,SECOND BOOK.,"Before they went to fossil, that anon"
1643,SECOND BOOK.,Their place should quicken with the elephant;
1644,SECOND BOOK.,They were not elephants but mastodons:
1645,SECOND BOOK.,"And I, a man, as men are now, and not"
1646,SECOND BOOK.,"As men may be hereafter, feel with men"
1647,SECOND BOOK.,In the agonising present.’
1648,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Is it so,’"
1649,SECOND BOOK.,"I said, ‘my cousin? is the world so bad,"
1650,SECOND BOOK.,While I hear nothing of it through the trees?
1651,SECOND BOOK.,"The world was always evil,—but so bad?’"
1652,SECOND BOOK.,
1653,SECOND BOOK.,"‘So bad, Aurora. Dear, my soul is grey"
1654,SECOND BOOK.,With poring over the long sum of ill;
1655,SECOND BOOK.,"So much for vice, so much for discontent,"
1656,SECOND BOOK.,"So much for the necessities of power,"
1657,SECOND BOOK.,"So much for the connivances of fear,—"
1658,SECOND BOOK.,Coherent in statistical despairs
1659,SECOND BOOK.,"With such a total of distracted life, ..."
1660,SECOND BOOK.,"To see it down in figures on a page,"
1661,SECOND BOOK.,"Plain, silent, clear ... as God sees through the earth"
1662,SECOND BOOK.,The sense of all the graves!... that’s terrible
1663,SECOND BOOK.,"For one who is not God, and cannot right"
1664,SECOND BOOK.,The wrong he looks on. May I choose indeed
1665,SECOND BOOK.,"But vow away my years, my means, my aims,"
1666,SECOND BOOK.,"Among the helpers, if there’s any help"
1667,SECOND BOOK.,In such a social strait? The common blood
1668,SECOND BOOK.,"That swings along my veins, is strong enough"
1669,SECOND BOOK.,To draw me to this duty.’
1670,SECOND BOOK.,Then I spoke.
1671,SECOND BOOK.,"‘I have not stood long on the strand of life,"
1672,SECOND BOOK.,And these salt waters have had scarcely time
1673,SECOND BOOK.,To creep so high up as to wet my feet.
1674,SECOND BOOK.,"I cannot judge these tides—I shall, perhaps."
1675,SECOND BOOK.,A woman’s always younger than a man
1676,SECOND BOOK.,"At equal years, because she is disallowed"
1677,SECOND BOOK.,"Maturing by the outdoor sun and air,"
1678,SECOND BOOK.,And kept in long-clothes past the age to walk.
1679,SECOND BOOK.,"Ah well, I know you men judge otherwise!"
1680,SECOND BOOK.,"You think a woman ripens as a peach,—In"
1681,SECOND BOOK.,"the cheeks, chiefly. Pass it to me now;"
1682,SECOND BOOK.,"I’m young in age, and younger still, I think,"
1683,SECOND BOOK.,As a woman. But a child may say amen
1684,SECOND BOOK.,To a bishop’s prayer and see the way it goes;
1685,SECOND BOOK.,"And I, incapable to loose the knot"
1686,SECOND BOOK.,"Of social questions, can approve, applaud"
1687,SECOND BOOK.,"August compassion, christian thoughts that shoot"
1688,SECOND BOOK.,Beyond the vulgar white of personal aims.
1689,SECOND BOOK.,Accept my reverence.’
1690,SECOND BOOK.,There he glowed on me
1691,SECOND BOOK.,With all his face and eyes. ‘No other help?’
1692,SECOND BOOK.,Said he—‘no more than so?’
1693,SECOND BOOK.,‘What help?’ I asked.
1694,SECOND BOOK.,"‘You’d scorn my help,—as Nature’s self, you say,"
1695,SECOND BOOK.,"Has scorned to put her music in my mouth,"
1696,SECOND BOOK.,Because a woman’s. Do you now turn round
1697,SECOND BOOK.,And ask for what a woman cannot give?’
1698,SECOND BOOK.,
1699,SECOND BOOK.,"‘For what she only can, I turn and ask,’"
1700,SECOND BOOK.,"He answered, catching up my hands in his,"
1701,SECOND BOOK.,And dropping on me from his high-eaved brow
1702,SECOND BOOK.,"The full weight of his soul,—‘I ask for love,"
1703,SECOND BOOK.,"And that, she can; for life in fellowship"
1704,SECOND BOOK.,"Through bitter duties—that, I know she can;"
1705,SECOND BOOK.,For wifehood ... will she?’
1706,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Now,’ I said, ‘may God"
1707,SECOND BOOK.,"Be witness ’twixt us two!’ and with the word,"
1708,SECOND BOOK.,Meseemed I floated into a sudden light
1709,SECOND BOOK.,"Above his stature,—‘am I proved too weak"
1710,SECOND BOOK.,"To stand alone, yet strong enough to bear"
1711,SECOND BOOK.,"Such leaners on my shoulder? poor to think,"
1712,SECOND BOOK.,Yet rich enough to sympathise with thought?
1713,SECOND BOOK.,"Incompetent to sing, as blackbirds can,"
1714,SECOND BOOK.,"Yet competent to love, like HIM?’"
1715,SECOND BOOK.,I paused:
1716,SECOND BOOK.,"Perhaps I darkened, as the light-house will"
1717,SECOND BOOK.,That turns upon the sea. ‘It’s always so!
1718,SECOND BOOK.,Anything does for a wife.’
1719,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Aurora, dear,"
1720,SECOND BOOK.,And dearly honoured’ ... he pressed in at once
1721,SECOND BOOK.,"With eager utterance,—‘you translate me ill."
1722,SECOND BOOK.,I do not contradict my thought of you
1723,SECOND BOOK.,"Which is most reverent, with another thought"
1724,SECOND BOOK.,"Found less so. If your sex is weak for art,"
1725,SECOND BOOK.,"(And I who said so, did but honour you"
1726,SECOND BOOK.,By using truth in courtship) it is strong
1727,SECOND BOOK.,For life and duty. Place your fecund heart
1728,SECOND BOOK.,"In mine, and let us blossom for the world"
1729,SECOND BOOK.,That wants love’s colour in the grey of time.
1730,SECOND BOOK.,With all my talk I can but set you where
1731,SECOND BOOK.,You look down coldly on the arena-heaps
1732,SECOND BOOK.,"Of headless bodies, shapeless, indistinct!"
1733,SECOND BOOK.,The Judgment-Angel scarce would find his way
1734,SECOND BOOK.,"Through such a heap of generalised distress,"
1735,SECOND BOOK.,To the individual man with lips and eyes—
1736,SECOND BOOK.,"Much less Aurora. Ah, my sweet, come down,"
1737,SECOND BOOK.,"And, hand in hand, we’ll go where yours shall touch"
1738,SECOND BOOK.,"These victims, one by one! till, one by one,"
1739,SECOND BOOK.,"The formless, nameless trunk of every man"
1740,SECOND BOOK.,"Shall seem to wear a head, with hair you know,"
1741,SECOND BOOK.,And every woman catch your mother’s face
1742,SECOND BOOK.,To melt you into passion.’
1743,SECOND BOOK.,"‘I am a girl,’"
1744,SECOND BOOK.,I answered slowly; ‘you do well to name
1745,SECOND BOOK.,"My mother’s face. Though far too early, alas,"
1746,SECOND BOOK.,"God’s hand did interpose ’twixt it and me,"
1747,SECOND BOOK.,"I know so much of love, as used to shine"
1748,SECOND BOOK.,In that face and another. Just so much;
1749,SECOND BOOK.,No more indeed at all. I have not seen
1750,SECOND BOOK.,"So much love since, I pray you pardon me,"
1751,SECOND BOOK.,"As answers even to make a marriage with,"
1752,SECOND BOOK.,"In this cold land of England. What you love,"
1753,SECOND BOOK.,"Is not a woman, Romney, but a cause:"
1754,SECOND BOOK.,"You want a helpmate, not a mistress, sir,—"
1755,SECOND BOOK.,A wife to help your ends ... in her no end!
1756,SECOND BOOK.,"Your cause is noble, your ends excellent,"
1757,SECOND BOOK.,"But I, being most unworthy of these and that,"
1758,SECOND BOOK.,Do otherwise conceive of love. Farewell.’
1759,SECOND BOOK.,
1760,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Farewell, Aurora? you reject me thus?’"
1761,SECOND BOOK.,He said.
1762,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Why, sir, you are married long ago."
1763,SECOND BOOK.,"You have a wife already whom you love,"
1764,SECOND BOOK.,"Your social theory. Bless you both, I say."
1765,SECOND BOOK.,"For my part, I am scarcely meek enough"
1766,SECOND BOOK.,To be the handmaid of a lawful spouse.
1767,SECOND BOOK.,"Do I look a Hagar, think you?’"
1768,SECOND BOOK.,"‘So, you jest!’"
1769,SECOND BOOK.,
1770,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Nay so, I speak in earnest,’ I replied."
1771,SECOND BOOK.,"‘You treat of marriage too much like, at least,"
1772,SECOND BOOK.,A chief apostle; you would bear with you
1773,SECOND BOOK.,A wife ... a sister ... shall we speak it out?
1774,SECOND BOOK.,A sister of charity.’
1775,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Then, must it be"
1776,SECOND BOOK.,Indeed farewell? And was I so far wrong
1777,SECOND BOOK.,"In hope and in illusion, when I took"
1778,SECOND BOOK.,"The woman to be nobler than the man,"
1779,SECOND BOOK.,"Yourself the noblest woman,—in the use"
1780,SECOND BOOK.,"And comprehension of what love is,—love,"
1781,SECOND BOOK.,That generates the likeness of itself
1782,SECOND BOOK.,"Through all heroic duties? so far wrong,"
1783,SECOND BOOK.,"In saying bluntly, venturing truth on love,"
1784,SECOND BOOK.,"Come, human creature, love and work with me,’—"
1785,SECOND BOOK.,"Instead of, ‘Lady, thou art wondrous fair,"
1786,SECOND BOOK.,"And, where the Graces walk before, the Muse"
1787,SECOND BOOK.,"Will follow at the lighting of their eyes,"
1788,SECOND BOOK.,"And where the Muse walks, lovers need to creep:"
1789,SECOND BOOK.,"Turn round and love me, or I die of love.’"
1790,SECOND BOOK.,
1791,SECOND BOOK.,With quiet indignation I broke in.
1792,SECOND BOOK.,"‘You misconceive the question like a man,"
1793,SECOND BOOK.,Who sees a woman as the complement
1794,SECOND BOOK.,Of his sex merely. You forget too much
1795,SECOND BOOK.,"That every creature, female as the male,"
1796,SECOND BOOK.,"Stands single in responsible act and thought,"
1797,SECOND BOOK.,As also in birth and death. Whoever says
1798,SECOND BOOK.,"To a loyal woman, ‘Love and work with me,’"
1799,SECOND BOOK.,"Will get fair answers, if the work and love,"
1800,SECOND BOOK.,"Being good themselves, are good for her—the best"
1801,SECOND BOOK.,"She was born for. Women of a softer mood,"
1802,SECOND BOOK.,"Surprised by men when scarcely awake to life,"
1803,SECOND BOOK.,"Will sometimes only hear the first word, love,"
1804,SECOND BOOK.,"And catch up with it any kind of work,"
1805,SECOND BOOK.,"Indifferent, so that dear love go with it:"
1806,SECOND BOOK.,"I do not blame such women, though, for love,"
1807,SECOND BOOK.,They pick much oakum; earth’s fanatics make
1808,SECOND BOOK.,"Too frequently heaven’s saints. But _me_, your work"
1809,SECOND BOOK.,"Is not the best for,—nor your love the best,"
1810,SECOND BOOK.,Nor able to commend the kind of work
1811,SECOND BOOK.,"For love’s sake merely. Ah, you force me, sir,"
1812,SECOND BOOK.,"To be over-bold in speaking of myself,—"
1813,SECOND BOOK.,"I, too, have my vocation,—work to do,"
1814,SECOND BOOK.,"The heavens and earth have set me, since I changed"
1815,SECOND BOOK.,"My father’s face for theirs,—and, though your world"
1816,SECOND BOOK.,"Were twice as wretched as you represent,"
1817,SECOND BOOK.,"Most serious work, most necessary work,"
1818,SECOND BOOK.,"As any of the economists’. Reform,"
1819,SECOND BOOK.,"Make trade a Christian possibility,"
1820,SECOND BOOK.,And individual right no general wrong;
1821,SECOND BOOK.,"Wipe out earth’s furrows of the Thine and Mine,"
1822,SECOND BOOK.,"And leave one green, for men to play at bowls,"
1823,SECOND BOOK.,"With innings for them all!... what then, indeed,"
1824,SECOND BOOK.,If mortals were not greater by the head
1825,SECOND BOOK.,"Than any of their prosperities? what then,"
1826,SECOND BOOK.,Unless the artist keep up open roads
1827,SECOND BOOK.,"Betwixt the seen and unseen,—bursting through"
1828,SECOND BOOK.,"The best of your conventions with his best,"
1829,SECOND BOOK.,"The speakable, imaginable best"
1830,SECOND BOOK.,"God bids him speak, to prove what lies beyond"
1831,SECOND BOOK.,Both speech and imagination? A starved man
1832,SECOND BOOK.,"Exceeds a fat beast: we’ll not barter, sir,"
1833,SECOND BOOK.,"The beautiful for barley.—And, even so,"
1834,SECOND BOOK.,I hold you will not compass your poor ends
1835,SECOND BOOK.,"Of barley-feeding and material ease,"
1836,SECOND BOOK.,Without a poet’s individualism
1837,SECOND BOOK.,"To work your universal. It takes a soul,"
1838,SECOND BOOK.,"To move a body: it takes a high-souled man,"
1839,SECOND BOOK.,To move the masses ... even to a cleaner stye:
1840,SECOND BOOK.,"It takes the ideal, to blow a hair’s-breadth off"
1841,SECOND BOOK.,"The dust of the actual.—Ah, your Fouriers failed,"
1842,SECOND BOOK.,Because not poets enough to understand
1843,SECOND BOOK.,"That life develops from within.——For me,"
1844,SECOND BOOK.,"Perhaps I am not worthy, as you say,"
1845,SECOND BOOK.,Of work like this!... perhaps a woman’s soul
1846,SECOND BOOK.,"Aspires, and not creates! yet we aspire,"
1847,SECOND BOOK.,"And yet I’ll try out your perhapses, sir;"
1848,SECOND BOOK.,"And if I fail ... why, burn me up my straw"
1849,SECOND BOOK.,"Like other false works—I’ll not ask for grace,"
1850,SECOND BOOK.,"Your scorn is better, cousin Romney. I"
1851,SECOND BOOK.,"Who love my art, would never wish it lower"
1852,SECOND BOOK.,To suit my stature. I may love my art.
1853,SECOND BOOK.,"You’ll grant that even a woman may love art,"
1854,SECOND BOOK.,"Seeing that to waste true love on anything,"
1855,SECOND BOOK.,"Is womanly, past question.’"
1856,SECOND BOOK.,I retain
1857,SECOND BOOK.,"The very last word which I said, that day,"
1858,SECOND BOOK.,"As you the creaking of the door, years past,"
1859,SECOND BOOK.,Which let upon you such disabling news
1860,SECOND BOOK.,"You ever after have been graver. He,"
1861,SECOND BOOK.,"His eyes, the motions in his silent mouth,"
1862,SECOND BOOK.,"Were fiery points on which my words were caught,"
1863,SECOND BOOK.,Transfixed for ever in my memory
1864,SECOND BOOK.,"For his sake, not their own. And yet I know"
1865,SECOND BOOK.,I did not love him ... nor he me ... that’s sure....
1866,SECOND BOOK.,"And what I said, is unrepented of,"
1867,SECOND BOOK.,As truth is always. Yet ... a princely man!—
1868,SECOND BOOK.,"If hard to me, heroic for himself!"
1869,SECOND BOOK.,"He bears down on me through the slanting years,"
1870,SECOND BOOK.,"The stronger for the distance. If he had loved,"
1871,SECOND BOOK.,"Ay, loved me, with that retributive face, ..."
1872,SECOND BOOK.,"I might have been a common woman now,"
1873,SECOND BOOK.,"And happier, less known and less left alone;"
1874,SECOND BOOK.,"Perhaps a better woman after all,—"
1875,SECOND BOOK.,With chubby children hanging on my neck
1876,SECOND BOOK.,"To keep me low and wise. Ah me, the vines"
1877,SECOND BOOK.,"That bear such fruit, are proud to stoop with it."
1878,SECOND BOOK.,The palm stands upright in a realm of sand.
1879,SECOND BOOK.,
1880,SECOND BOOK.,"And I, who spoke the truth then, stand upright,"
1881,SECOND BOOK.,"Still worthy of having spoken out the truth,"
1882,SECOND BOOK.,"By being content I spoke it, though it set"
1883,SECOND BOOK.,"Him there, me here.—O woman’s vile remorse,"
1884,SECOND BOOK.,"To hanker after a mere name, a show,"
1885,SECOND BOOK.,"A supposition, a potential love!"
1886,SECOND BOOK.,"Does every man who names love in our lives,"
1887,SECOND BOOK.,Become a power for that? is love’s true thing
1888,SECOND BOOK.,"So much best to us, that what personates love"
1889,SECOND BOOK.,"Is next best? A potential love, forsooth!"
1890,SECOND BOOK.,"We are not so vile. No, no—he cleaves, I think,"
1891,SECOND BOOK.,"This man, this image, ... chiefly for the wrong"
1892,SECOND BOOK.,"And shock he gave my life, in finding me"
1893,SECOND BOOK.,Precisely where the devil of my youth
1894,SECOND BOOK.,"Had set me, on those mountain-peaks of hope"
1895,SECOND BOOK.,"All glittering with the dawn-dew, all erect"
1896,SECOND BOOK.,"And famished for the morning,—saying, while"
1897,SECOND BOOK.,"I looked for empire and much tribute, ‘Come,"
1898,SECOND BOOK.,I have some worthy work for thee below.
1899,SECOND BOOK.,"Come, sweep my barns, and keep my hospitals,—"
1900,SECOND BOOK.,And I will pay thee with a current coin
1901,SECOND BOOK.,Which men give women.’
1902,SECOND BOOK.,"As we spoke, the grass"
1903,SECOND BOOK.,"Was trod in haste beside us, and my aunt,"
1904,SECOND BOOK.,"With smile distorted by the sun,—face, voice,"
1905,SECOND BOOK.,As much at issue with the summer-day
1906,SECOND BOOK.,"As if you brought a candle out of doors,—"
1907,SECOND BOOK.,"Broke in with, ‘Romney, here!—My child, entreat"
1908,SECOND BOOK.,"Your cousin to the house, and have your talk,"
1909,SECOND BOOK.,"If girls must talk upon their birthdays. Come,’"
1910,SECOND BOOK.,
1911,SECOND BOOK.,"He answered for me calmly, with pale lips"
1912,SECOND BOOK.,That seemed to motion for a smile in vain.
1913,SECOND BOOK.,"‘The talk is ended, madam, where we stand."
1914,SECOND BOOK.,Your brother’s daughter has dismissed me here;
1915,SECOND BOOK.,And all my answer can be better said
1916,SECOND BOOK.,"Beneath the trees, than wrong by such a word"
1917,SECOND BOOK.,Your house’s hospitalities. Farewell.’
1918,SECOND BOOK.,
1919,SECOND BOOK.,With that he vanished. I could hear his heel
1920,SECOND BOOK.,"Ring bluntly in the lane, as down he leapt"
1921,SECOND BOOK.,"The short way from us.—Then, a measured speech"
1922,SECOND BOOK.,"Withdrew me. ‘What means this, Aurora Leigh?"
1923,SECOND BOOK.,My brother’s daughter has dismissed my guests?’
1924,SECOND BOOK.,
1925,SECOND BOOK.,"The lion in me felt the keeper’s voice,"
1926,SECOND BOOK.,Through all its quivering dewlaps: I was quelled
1927,SECOND BOOK.,"Before her,—meekened to the child she knew:"
1928,SECOND BOOK.,"I prayed her pardon, said, ‘I had little thought"
1929,SECOND BOOK.,"To give dismissal to a guest of hers,"
1930,SECOND BOOK.,"In letting go a friend of mine, who came"
1931,SECOND BOOK.,"To take me into service as a wife,—"
1932,SECOND BOOK.,"No more than that, indeed.’"
1933,SECOND BOOK.,"‘No more, no more?"
1934,SECOND BOOK.,"Pray Heaven,’ she answered, ‘that I was not mad."
1935,SECOND BOOK.,I could not mean to tell her to her face
1936,SECOND BOOK.,"That Romney Leigh had asked me for a wife,"
1937,SECOND BOOK.,And I refused him?’
1938,SECOND BOOK.,‘Did he ask?’ I said;
1939,SECOND BOOK.,‘I think he rather stooped to take me up
1940,SECOND BOOK.,For certain uses which he found to do
1941,SECOND BOOK.,For something called a wife. He never asked.’
1942,SECOND BOOK.,
1943,SECOND BOOK.,"‘What stuff!’ she answered; ‘are they queens, these girls?"
1944,SECOND BOOK.,"They must have mantles, stitched with twenty silks,"
1945,SECOND BOOK.,"Spread out upon the ground, before they’ll step"
1946,SECOND BOOK.,One footstep for the noblest lover born.’
1947,SECOND BOOK.,
1948,SECOND BOOK.,"‘But I am born,’ I said with firmness, ‘I,"
1949,SECOND BOOK.,"To walk another way than his, dear aunt.’"
1950,SECOND BOOK.,
1951,SECOND BOOK.,"‘You walk, you walk! A babe at thirteen months"
1952,SECOND BOOK.,"Will walk as well as you,’ she cried in haste,"
1953,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Without a steadying finger. Why, you child,"
1954,SECOND BOOK.,"God help you, you are groping in the dark,"
1955,SECOND BOOK.,"For all this sunlight. You suppose, perhaps,"
1956,SECOND BOOK.,"That you, sole offspring of an opulent man,"
1957,SECOND BOOK.,Are rich and free to choose a way to walk?
1958,SECOND BOOK.,"You think, and it’s a reasonable thought,"
1959,SECOND BOOK.,"That I besides, being well to do in life,"
1960,SECOND BOOK.,Will leave my handful in my niece’s hand
1961,SECOND BOOK.,"When death shall paralyse these fingers? Pray,"
1962,SECOND BOOK.,"Pray, child,—albeit I know you love me not,—"
1963,SECOND BOOK.,"As if you loved me, that I may not die!"
1964,SECOND BOOK.,"For when I die and leave you, out you go,"
1965,SECOND BOOK.,(Unless I make room for you in my grave)
1966,SECOND BOOK.,"Unhoused, unfed, my dear, poor brother’s lamb,"
1967,SECOND BOOK.,"(Ah heaven,—that pains!)—without a right to crop"
1968,SECOND BOOK.,"A single blade of grass beneath these trees,"
1969,SECOND BOOK.,"Or cast a lamb’s small shadow on the lawn,"
1970,SECOND BOOK.,"Unfed, unfolded! Ah, my brother, here’s"
1971,SECOND BOOK.,The fruit you planted in your foreign loves!—
1972,SECOND BOOK.,"Ay, there’s the fruit he planted! never look"
1973,SECOND BOOK.,"Astonished at me with your mother’s eyes,"
1974,SECOND BOOK.,"For it was they, who set you where you are,"
1975,SECOND BOOK.,"An undowered orphan. Child, your father’s choice"
1976,SECOND BOOK.,"Of that said mother, disinherited"
1977,SECOND BOOK.,"His daughter, his and hers. Men do not think"
1978,SECOND BOOK.,"Of sons and daughters, when they fall in love,"
1979,SECOND BOOK.,"So much more than of sisters; otherwise,"
1980,SECOND BOOK.,"He would have paused to ponder what he did,"
1981,SECOND BOOK.,And shrunk before that clause in the entail
1982,SECOND BOOK.,"Excluding offspring by a foreign wife,"
1983,SECOND BOOK.,(The clause set up a hundred years ago
1984,SECOND BOOK.,By a Leigh who wedded a French dancing-girl
1985,SECOND BOOK.,And had his heart danced over in return);
1986,SECOND BOOK.,"But this man shrunk at nothing, never thought"
1987,SECOND BOOK.,"Of you, Aurora, any more than me—"
1988,SECOND BOOK.,"Your mother must have been a pretty thing,"
1989,SECOND BOOK.,"For all the coarse Italian blacks and browns,"
1990,SECOND BOOK.,"To make a good man, which my brother was,"
1991,SECOND BOOK.,Unchary of the duties to his house;
1992,SECOND BOOK.,"But so it fell indeed. Our cousin Vane,"
1993,SECOND BOOK.,"Vane Leigh, the father of this Romney, wrote"
1994,SECOND BOOK.,"Directly on your birth, to Italy,"
1995,SECOND BOOK.,‘I ask your baby daughter for my son
1996,SECOND BOOK.,In whom the entail now merges by the law.
1997,SECOND BOOK.,"Betroth her to us out of love, instead"
1998,SECOND BOOK.,"Of colder reasons, and she shall not lose"
1999,SECOND BOOK.,By love or law from henceforth’—so he wrote;
2000,SECOND BOOK.,"A generous cousin, was my cousin Vane."
2001,SECOND BOOK.,Remember how he drew you to his knee
2002,SECOND BOOK.,"The year you came here, just before he died,"
2003,SECOND BOOK.,"And hollowed out his hands to hold your cheeks,"
2004,SECOND BOOK.,"And wished them redder,—you remember Vane?"
2005,SECOND BOOK.,And now his son who represents our house
2006,SECOND BOOK.,"And holds the fiefs and manors in his place,"
2007,SECOND BOOK.,"To whom reverts my pittance when I die,"
2008,SECOND BOOK.,(Except a few books and a pair of shawls)
2009,SECOND BOOK.,"The boy is generous like him, and prepared"
2010,SECOND BOOK.,To carry out his kindest word and thought
2011,SECOND BOOK.,"To you, Aurora. Yes, a fine young man"
2012,SECOND BOOK.,Is Romney Leigh; although the sun of youth
2013,SECOND BOOK.,"Has shone too straight upon his brain, I know,"
2014,SECOND BOOK.,And fevered him with dreams of doing good
2015,SECOND BOOK.,To good-for-nothing people. But a wife
2016,SECOND BOOK.,"Will put all right, and stroke his temples cool"
2017,SECOND BOOK.,With healthy touches’....
2018,SECOND BOOK.,I broke in at that.
2019,SECOND BOOK.,I could not lift my heavy heart to breathe
2020,SECOND BOOK.,"Till then, but then I raised it, and it fell"
2021,SECOND BOOK.,In broken words like these—‘No need to wait.
2022,SECOND BOOK.,"The dream of doing good to ... me, at least,"
2023,SECOND BOOK.,"Is ended, without waiting for a wife"
2024,SECOND BOOK.,To cool the fever for him. We’ve escaped
2025,SECOND BOOK.,That danger ... thank Heaven for it.’
2026,SECOND BOOK.,"‘You,’ she cried,"
2027,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Have got a fever. What, I talk and talk"
2028,SECOND BOOK.,"An hour long to you,—I instruct you how"
2029,SECOND BOOK.,"You cannot eat or drink or stand or sit,"
2030,SECOND BOOK.,"Or even die, like any decent wretch"
2031,SECOND BOOK.,"In all this unroofed and unfurnished world,"
2032,SECOND BOOK.,"Without your cousin,—and you still maintain"
2033,SECOND BOOK.,"There’s room ’twixt him and you, for flirting fans"
2034,SECOND BOOK.,And running knots in eyebrows! You must have
2035,SECOND BOOK.,A pattern lover sighing on his knee:
2036,SECOND BOOK.,"You do not count enough a noble heart,"
2037,SECOND BOOK.,"Above book-patterns, which this very morn"
2038,SECOND BOOK.,"Unclosed itself, in two dear fathers’ names,"
2039,SECOND BOOK.,"To embrace your orphaned life! fie, fie! But stay,"
2040,SECOND BOOK.,"I write a word, and counteract this sin.’"
2041,SECOND BOOK.,
2042,SECOND BOOK.,"She would have turned to leave me, but I clung."
2043,SECOND BOOK.,"‘O sweet my father’s sister, hear my word"
2044,SECOND BOOK.,"Before you write yours. Cousin Vane did well,"
2045,SECOND BOOK.,"And cousin Romney well,—and I well too,"
2046,SECOND BOOK.,In casting back with all my strength and will
2047,SECOND BOOK.,"The good they meant me. O my God, my God!"
2048,SECOND BOOK.,"God meant me good, too, when he hindered me"
2049,SECOND BOOK.,From saying ‘yes’ this morning. If you write
2050,SECOND BOOK.,"A word, it shall be ‘no.’ I say no, no!"
2051,SECOND BOOK.,"I tie up ‘no’ upon His altar-horns,"
2052,SECOND BOOK.,Quite out of reach of perjury! At least
2053,SECOND BOOK.,My soul is not a pauper; I can live
2054,SECOND BOOK.,"At least my soul’s life, without alms from men;"
2055,SECOND BOOK.,"And if it must be in heaven instead of earth,"
2056,SECOND BOOK.,"Let heaven look to it,—I am not afraid,’"
2057,SECOND BOOK.,
2058,SECOND BOOK.,"She seized my hands with both hers, strained them fast,"
2059,SECOND BOOK.,And drew her probing and unscrupulous eyes
2060,SECOND BOOK.,"Right through me, body and heart. ‘Yet, foolish Sweet,"
2061,SECOND BOOK.,"You love this man. I have watched you when he came,"
2062,SECOND BOOK.,"And when he went, and when we’ve talked of him:"
2063,SECOND BOOK.,I am not old for nothing; I can tell
2064,SECOND BOOK.,The weather-signs of love—you love this man.’
2065,SECOND BOOK.,
2066,SECOND BOOK.,"Girls blush, sometimes, because they are alive,"
2067,SECOND BOOK.,Half wishing they were dead to save the shame.
2068,SECOND BOOK.,"The sudden blush devours them, neck and brow;"
2069,SECOND BOOK.,"They have drawn too near the fire of life, like gnats,"
2070,SECOND BOOK.,"And flare up bodily, wings and all. What then?"
2071,SECOND BOOK.,Who’s sorry for a gnat ... or girl?
2072,SECOND BOOK.,I blushed.
2073,SECOND BOOK.,I feel the brand upon my forehead now
2074,SECOND BOOK.,"Strike hot, sear deep, as guiltless men may feel"
2075,SECOND BOOK.,"The felon’s iron, say, and scorn the mark"
2076,SECOND BOOK.,Of what they are not. Most illogical
2077,SECOND BOOK.,"Irrational nature of our womanhood,"
2078,SECOND BOOK.,"That blushes one way, feels another way,"
2079,SECOND BOOK.,"And prays, perhaps, another! After all,"
2080,SECOND BOOK.,"We cannot be the equal of the male,"
2081,SECOND BOOK.,Who rules his blood a little.
2082,SECOND BOOK.,For although
2083,SECOND BOOK.,"I blushed indeed, as if I loved the man,"
2084,SECOND BOOK.,"And her incisive smile, accrediting"
2085,SECOND BOOK.,"That treason of false witness in my blush,"
2086,SECOND BOOK.,Did bow me downward like a swathe of grass
2087,SECOND BOOK.,"Below its level that struck me,—I attest"
2088,SECOND BOOK.,"The conscious skies and all their daily suns,"
2089,SECOND BOOK.,"I think I loved him not ... nor then, nor since...."
2090,SECOND BOOK.,"Nor ever. Do we love the schoolmaster,"
2091,SECOND BOOK.,"Being busy in the woods? much less, being poor,"
2092,SECOND BOOK.,The overseer of the parish? Do we keep
2093,SECOND BOOK.,"Our love, to pay our debts with?"
2094,SECOND BOOK.,White and cold
2095,SECOND BOOK.,I grew next moment. As my blood recoiled
2096,SECOND BOOK.,"From that imputed ignominy, I made"
2097,SECOND BOOK.,"My heart great with it. Then, at last, I spoke,—"
2098,SECOND BOOK.,"Spoke veritable words, but passionate,"
2099,SECOND BOOK.,Too passionate perhaps ... ground up with sobs
2100,SECOND BOOK.,"To shapeless endings. She let fall my hands,"
2101,SECOND BOOK.,"And took her smile off, in sedate disgust,"
2102,SECOND BOOK.,"As peradventure she had touched a snake,—"
2103,SECOND BOOK.,"A dead snake, mind!—and, turning round, replied,"
2104,SECOND BOOK.,"‘We’ll leave Italian manners, if you please."
2105,SECOND BOOK.,"I think you had an English father, child,"
2106,SECOND BOOK.,And ought to find it possible to speak
2107,SECOND BOOK.,"A quiet ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ like English girls,"
2108,SECOND BOOK.,Without convulsions. In another month
2109,SECOND BOOK.,"We’ll take another answer ... no, or yes.’"
2110,SECOND BOOK.,"With that, she left me in the garden-walk."
2111,SECOND BOOK.,
2112,SECOND BOOK.,"I had a father! yes, but long ago—"
2113,SECOND BOOK.,"How long it seemed that moment. Oh, how far,"
2114,SECOND BOOK.,"How far and safe, God, dost thou keep thy saints"
2115,SECOND BOOK.,When once gone from us! We may call against
2116,SECOND BOOK.,The lighted windows of thy fair June-heaven
2117,SECOND BOOK.,"Where all the souls are happy,—and not one,"
2118,SECOND BOOK.,"Not even my father, look from work or play"
2119,SECOND BOOK.,"To ask, ‘Who is it that cries after us,"
2120,SECOND BOOK.,"Below there, in the dusk?’ Yet formerly"
2121,SECOND BOOK.,"He turned his face upon me quick enough,"
2122,SECOND BOOK.,If I said ‘father.’ Now I might cry loud;
2123,SECOND BOOK.,The little lark reached higher with his song
2124,SECOND BOOK.,"Than I with crying. Oh, alone, alone,—"
2125,SECOND BOOK.,"Not troubling any in heaven, nor any on earth,"
2126,SECOND BOOK.,"I stood there in the garden, and looked up"
2127,SECOND BOOK.,The deaf blue sky that brings the roses out
2128,SECOND BOOK.,On such June mornings.
2129,SECOND BOOK.,You who keep account
2130,SECOND BOOK.,"Of crisis and transition in this life,"
2131,SECOND BOOK.,Set down the first time Nature says plain ‘no’
2132,SECOND BOOK.,"To some ‘yes’ in you, and walks over you"
2133,SECOND BOOK.,In gorgeous sweeps of scorn. We all begin
2134,SECOND BOOK.,"By singing with the birds, and running fast"
2135,SECOND BOOK.,"With June-days, hand in hand: but once, for all,"
2136,SECOND BOOK.,"The birds must sing against us, and the sun"
2137,SECOND BOOK.,Strike down upon us like a friend’s sword caught
2138,SECOND BOOK.,"By an enemy to slay us, while we read"
2139,SECOND BOOK.,The dear name on the blade which bites at us!—
2140,SECOND BOOK.,"That’s bitter and convincing: after that,"
2141,SECOND BOOK.,We seldom doubt that something in the large
2142,SECOND BOOK.,"Smooth order of creation, though no more"
2143,SECOND BOOK.,"Than haply a man’s footstep, has gone wrong."
2144,SECOND BOOK.,
2145,SECOND BOOK.,"Some tears fell down my cheeks, and then I smiled,"
2146,SECOND BOOK.,As those smile who have no face in the world
2147,SECOND BOOK.,To smile back to them. I had lost a friend
2148,SECOND BOOK.,"In Romney Leigh; the thing was sure—a friend,"
2149,SECOND BOOK.,"Who had looked at me most gently now and then,"
2150,SECOND BOOK.,And spoken of my favourite books ... ‘our books’ ...
2151,SECOND BOOK.,"With such a voice! Well, voice and look were now"
2152,SECOND BOOK.,"More utterly shut out from me, I felt,"
2153,SECOND BOOK.,Than even my father’s. Romney now was turned
2154,SECOND BOOK.,"To a benefactor, to a generous man,"
2155,SECOND BOOK.,"Who had tied himself to marry ... me, instead"
2156,SECOND BOOK.,"Of such a woman, with low timorous lids"
2157,SECOND BOOK.,"He lifted with a sudden word one day,"
2158,SECOND BOOK.,"And left, perhaps, for my sake.—Ah, self-tied"
2159,SECOND BOOK.,"By a contract,—male Iphigenia, bound"
2160,SECOND BOOK.,"At a fatal Aulis, for the winds to change,"
2161,SECOND BOOK.,(But loose him—they’ll not change); he well might seem
2162,SECOND BOOK.,A little cold and dominant in love!
2163,SECOND BOOK.,"He had a right to be dogmatical,"
2164,SECOND BOOK.,"This poor, good Romney. Love, to him, was made"
2165,SECOND BOOK.,"A simple law-clause. If I married him,"
2166,SECOND BOOK.,"I would not dare to call my soul my own,"
2167,SECOND BOOK.,Which so he had bought and paid for: every thought
2168,SECOND BOOK.,"And every heart-beat down there in the bill,—"
2169,SECOND BOOK.,Not one found honestly deductible
2170,SECOND BOOK.,From any use that pleased him! He might cut
2171,SECOND BOOK.,My body into coins to give away
2172,SECOND BOOK.,"Among his other paupers; change my sons,"
2173,SECOND BOOK.,"While I stood dumb as Griseld, for black babes"
2174,SECOND BOOK.,Or piteous foundlings; might unquestioned set
2175,SECOND BOOK.,"My right hand teaching in the Ragged Schools,"
2176,SECOND BOOK.,"My left hand washing in the Public Baths,"
2177,SECOND BOOK.,What time my angel of the Ideal stretched
2178,SECOND BOOK.,Both his to me in vain! I could not claim
2179,SECOND BOOK.,"The poor right of a mouse in a trap, to squeal,"
2180,SECOND BOOK.,"And take so much as pity, from myself."
2181,SECOND BOOK.,
2182,SECOND BOOK.,"Farewell, good Romney! if I loved you even,"
2183,SECOND BOOK.,I could but ill afford to let you be
2184,SECOND BOOK.,"So generous to me. Farewell, friend, since friend"
2185,SECOND BOOK.,"Betwixt us two, forsooth, must be a word"
2186,SECOND BOOK.,"So heavily overladen. And, since help"
2187,SECOND BOOK.,"Must come to me from those who love me not,"
2188,SECOND BOOK.,"Farewell, all helpers—I must help myself,"
2189,SECOND BOOK.,"And am alone from henceforth.—Then I stooped,"
2190,SECOND BOOK.,"And lifted the soiled garland from the ground,"
2191,SECOND BOOK.,And set it on my head as bitterly
2192,SECOND BOOK.,As when the Spanish king did crown the bones
2193,SECOND BOOK.,Of his dead love. So be it. I preserve
2194,SECOND BOOK.,"That crown still,—in the drawer there! ’twas the first;"
2195,SECOND BOOK.,"The rest are like it;—those Olympian crowns,"
2196,SECOND BOOK.,"We run for, till we lose sight of the sun"
2197,SECOND BOOK.,In the dust of the racing chariots!
2198,SECOND BOOK.,"After that,"
2199,SECOND BOOK.,"Before the evening fell, I had a note"
2200,SECOND BOOK.,"Which ran,—‘Aurora, sweet Chaldean, you read"
2201,SECOND BOOK.,"My meaning backward like your eastern books,"
2202,SECOND BOOK.,"While I am from the west, dear. Read me now"
2203,SECOND BOOK.,A little plainer. Did you hate me quite
2204,SECOND BOOK.,But yesterday? I loved you for my part;
2205,SECOND BOOK.,I love you. If I spoke untenderly
2206,SECOND BOOK.,"This morning, my beloved, pardon it;"
2207,SECOND BOOK.,"And comprehend me that I loved you so,"
2208,SECOND BOOK.,"I set you on the level of my soul,"
2209,SECOND BOOK.,And overwashed you with the bitter brine
2210,SECOND BOOK.,"Of some habitual thoughts. Henceforth, my flower,"
2211,SECOND BOOK.,"Be planted out of reach of any such,"
2212,SECOND BOOK.,"And lean the side you please, with all your leaves!"
2213,SECOND BOOK.,Write woman’s verses and dream woman’s dreams;
2214,SECOND BOOK.,"But let me feel your perfume in my home,"
2215,SECOND BOOK.,To make my sabbath after working-days;
2216,SECOND BOOK.,"Bloom out your youth beside me,—be my wife.’"
2217,SECOND BOOK.,
2218,SECOND BOOK.,"I wrote in answer—‘We, Chaldeans, discern"
2219,SECOND BOOK.,"Still farther than we read. I know your heart,"
2220,SECOND BOOK.,"And shut it like the holy book it is,"
2221,SECOND BOOK.,Reserved for mild-eyed saints to pore upon
2222,SECOND BOOK.,"Betwixt their prayers at vespers. Well, you’re right,"
2223,SECOND BOOK.,I did not surely hate you yesterday;
2224,SECOND BOOK.,And yet I do not love you enough to-day
2225,SECOND BOOK.,"To wed you, cousin Romney. Take this word,"
2226,SECOND BOOK.,And let it stop you as a generous man
2227,SECOND BOOK.,"From speaking farther. You may tease, indeed,"
2228,SECOND BOOK.,"And blow about my feelings, or my leaves,—"
2229,SECOND BOOK.,"And here’s my aunt will help you with east winds,"
2230,SECOND BOOK.,"And break a stalk, perhaps, tormenting me;"
2231,SECOND BOOK.,"But certain flowers grow near as deep as trees,"
2232,SECOND BOOK.,"And, cousin, you’ll not move my root, not you,"
2233,SECOND BOOK.,With all your confluent storms. Then let me grow
2234,SECOND BOOK.,"Within my wayside hedge, and pass your way!"
2235,SECOND BOOK.,This flower has never as much to say to you
2236,SECOND BOOK.,"As the antique tomb which said to travellers, ‘Pause,’"
2237,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Siste, viator.’ Ending thus, I signed."
2238,SECOND BOOK.,
2239,SECOND BOOK.,"The next week passed in silence, so the next,"
2240,SECOND BOOK.,"And several after: Romney did not come,"
2241,SECOND BOOK.,"Nor my aunt chide me. I lived on and on,"
2242,SECOND BOOK.,"As if my heart were kept beneath a glass,"
2243,SECOND BOOK.,"And everybody stood, all eyes and ears,"
2244,SECOND BOOK.,"To see and hear it tick. I could not sit,"
2245,SECOND BOOK.,"Nor walk, nor take a book, nor lay it down,"
2246,SECOND BOOK.,"Not sew on steadily, nor drop a stitch"
2247,SECOND BOOK.,"And a sigh with it, but I felt her looks"
2248,SECOND BOOK.,"Still cleaving to me, like the sucking asp"
2249,SECOND BOOK.,"To Cleopatra’s breast, persistently"
2250,SECOND BOOK.,"Through the intermittent pantings. Being observed,"
2251,SECOND BOOK.,"When observation is not sympathy,"
2252,SECOND BOOK.,"Is just being tortured. If she said a word,"
2253,SECOND BOOK.,"A ‘thank you,’ or an ‘if it please you, dear,’"
2254,SECOND BOOK.,"She meant a commination, or, at best,"
2255,SECOND BOOK.,An exorcism against the devildom
2256,SECOND BOOK.,Which plainly held me. So with all the house.
2257,SECOND BOOK.,"Susannah could not stand and twist my hair,"
2258,SECOND BOOK.,Without such glancing at the looking-glass
2259,SECOND BOOK.,"To see my face there, that she missed the plait:"
2260,SECOND BOOK.,"And John,—I never sent my plate for soup,"
2261,SECOND BOOK.,"Or did not send it, but the foolish John"
2262,SECOND BOOK.,"Resolved the problem, ’twixt his napkined thumbs,"
2263,SECOND BOOK.,Of what was signified by taking soup
2264,SECOND BOOK.,"Or choosing mackerel. Neighbours, who dropped in"
2265,SECOND BOOK.,"On morning visits, feeling a joint wrong,"
2266,SECOND BOOK.,"Smiled admonition, sate uneasily,"
2267,SECOND BOOK.,"And talked with measured, emphasised reserve,"
2268,SECOND BOOK.,"Of parish news, like doctors to the sick,"
2269,SECOND BOOK.,"When not called in,—as if, with leave to speak,"
2270,SECOND BOOK.,"They might say something. Nay, the very dog"
2271,SECOND BOOK.,"Would watch me from his sun-patch on the floor,"
2272,SECOND BOOK.,In alternation with the large black fly
2273,SECOND BOOK.,Not yet in reach of snapping. So I lived.
2274,SECOND BOOK.,
2275,SECOND BOOK.,"A Roman died so; smeared with honey, teased"
2276,SECOND BOOK.,"By insects, stared to torture by the noon:"
2277,SECOND BOOK.,And many patient souls ’neath English roofs
2278,SECOND BOOK.,"Have died like Romans. I, in looking back,"
2279,SECOND BOOK.,"Wish only, now, I had borne the plague of all"
2280,SECOND BOOK.,With meeker spirits than were rife in Rome.
2281,SECOND BOOK.,
2282,SECOND BOOK.,"For, on the sixth week, the dead sea broke up,"
2283,SECOND BOOK.,Dashed suddenly through beneath the heel of Him
2284,SECOND BOOK.,"Who stands upon the sea and earth, and swears"
2285,SECOND BOOK.,Time shall be nevermore. The clock struck nine
2286,SECOND BOOK.,"That morning, too,—no lark was out of tune;"
2287,SECOND BOOK.,"The hidden farms among the hills, breathed straight"
2288,SECOND BOOK.,Their smoke toward heaven; the lime-tree scarcely stirred
2289,SECOND BOOK.,"Beneath the blue weight of the cloudless sky,"
2290,SECOND BOOK.,Though still the July air came floating through
2291,SECOND BOOK.,"The woodbine at my window, in and out,"
2292,SECOND BOOK.,With touches of the out-door country-news
2293,SECOND BOOK.,"For a bending forehead. There I sate, and wished"
2294,SECOND BOOK.,"That morning-truce of God would last till eve,"
2295,SECOND BOOK.,"Or longer. ‘Sleep,’ I thought, ‘late sleepers,—sleep,"
2296,SECOND BOOK.,"And spare me yet, the burden of your eyes.’"
2297,SECOND BOOK.,
2298,SECOND BOOK.,"Then, suddenly, a single ghastly shriek"
2299,SECOND BOOK.,Tore upwards from the bottom of the house.
2300,SECOND BOOK.,"Like one who wakens in a grave and shrieks,"
2301,SECOND BOOK.,"The still house seemed to shriek itself alive,"
2302,SECOND BOOK.,And shudder through its passages and stairs
2303,SECOND BOOK.,"With slam of doors and clash of bells.—I sprang,"
2304,SECOND BOOK.,"I stood up in the middle of the room,"
2305,SECOND BOOK.,"And there confronted at my chamber-door,"
2306,SECOND BOOK.,"A white face,—shivering, ineffectual lips."
2307,SECOND BOOK.,
2308,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Come, come,’ they tried to utter, and I went;"
2309,SECOND BOOK.,As if a ghost had drawn me at the point
2310,SECOND BOOK.,"Of a fiery finger through the uneven dark,"
2311,SECOND BOOK.,"I went with reeling footsteps down the stair,"
2312,SECOND BOOK.,Nor asked a question.
2313,SECOND BOOK.,"There she sate, my aunt,—"
2314,SECOND BOOK.,"Bolt upright in the chair beside her bed,"
2315,SECOND BOOK.,Whose pillow had no dint! she had used no bed
2316,SECOND BOOK.,"For that night’s sleeping ... yet slept well. My God,"
2317,SECOND BOOK.,"The dumb derision of that grey, peaked face"
2318,SECOND BOOK.,"Concluded something grave against the sun,"
2319,SECOND BOOK.,Which filled the chamber with its July burst
2320,SECOND BOOK.,"When Susan drew the curtains, ignorant"
2321,SECOND BOOK.,"Of who sate open-eyed behind her. There,"
2322,SECOND BOOK.,She sate ... it sate ... we said ‘she’ yesterday ...
2323,SECOND BOOK.,"And held a letter with unbroken seal,"
2324,SECOND BOOK.,As Susan gave it to her hand last night:
2325,SECOND BOOK.,All night she had held it. If its news referred
2326,SECOND BOOK.,"To duchies or to dunghills, not an inch"
2327,SECOND BOOK.,"She’d budge, ’twas obvious, for such worthless odds:"
2328,SECOND BOOK.,"Nor, though the stars were suns, and overburned"
2329,SECOND BOOK.,"Their spheric limitations, swallowing up"
2330,SECOND BOOK.,"Like wax the azure spaces, could they force"
2331,SECOND BOOK.,Those open eyes to wink once. What last sight
2332,SECOND BOOK.,"Had left them blank and flat so,—drawing out"
2333,SECOND BOOK.,"The faculty of vision from the roots,"
2334,SECOND BOOK.,"As nothing more, worth seeing, remained behind?"
2335,SECOND BOOK.,
2336,SECOND BOOK.,"Were those the eyes that watched me, worried me?"
2337,SECOND BOOK.,"That dogged me up and down the hours and days,"
2338,SECOND BOOK.,"A beaten, breathless, miserable soul?"
2339,SECOND BOOK.,"And did I pray, a half hour back, but so,"
2340,SECOND BOOK.,To escape the burden of those eyes ... those eyes?
2341,SECOND BOOK.,‘Sleep late’ I said.—
2342,SECOND BOOK.,"Why now, indeed, they sleep."
2343,SECOND BOOK.,"God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers,"
2344,SECOND BOOK.,"And thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face,"
2345,SECOND BOOK.,A gauntlet with a gift in’t. Every wish
2346,SECOND BOOK.,Is like a prayer ... with God.
2347,SECOND BOOK.,"I had my wish,—"
2348,SECOND BOOK.,"To read and meditate the thing I would,"
2349,SECOND BOOK.,"To fashion all my life upon my thought,"
2350,SECOND BOOK.,"And marry, or not marry. Henceforth, none"
2351,SECOND BOOK.,"Could disapprove me, vex me, hamper me."
2352,SECOND BOOK.,"Full ground-room, in this desert newly made,"
2353,SECOND BOOK.,"For Babylon or Balbec,—when the breath,"
2354,SECOND BOOK.,"Just choked with sand, returns, for building towns!"
2355,SECOND BOOK.,"The heir came over on the funeral day,"
2356,SECOND BOOK.,"And we two cousins met before the dead,"
2357,SECOND BOOK.,With two pale faces. Was it death or life
2358,SECOND BOOK.,"That moved us? When the will was read and done,"
2359,SECOND BOOK.,"The official guest and witnesses withdrawn,"
2360,SECOND BOOK.,"We rose up in a silence almost hard,"
2361,SECOND BOOK.,"And looked at one another. Then I said,"
2362,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Farewell, my cousin.’"
2363,SECOND BOOK.,"But he touched, just touched"
2364,SECOND BOOK.,"My hatstrings tied for going, (at the door"
2365,SECOND BOOK.,"The carriage stood to take me) and said low,"
2366,SECOND BOOK.,"His voice a little unsteady through his smile,"
2367,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Siste, viator.’"
2368,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Is there time,’ I asked,"
2369,SECOND BOOK.,"‘In these last days of railroads, to stop short"
2370,SECOND BOOK.,Like Cæsar’s chariot (weighing half a ton)
2371,SECOND BOOK.,"On the Appian road, for morals?’"
2372,SECOND BOOK.,"‘There is time,’"
2373,SECOND BOOK.,"He answered grave, ‘for necessary words,"
2374,SECOND BOOK.,"Inclusive, trust me, of no epitaph"
2375,SECOND BOOK.,"On man or act, my cousin. We have read"
2376,SECOND BOOK.,"A will, which gives you all the personal goods"
2377,SECOND BOOK.,And funded monies of your aunt.’
2378,SECOND BOOK.,‘I thank
2379,SECOND BOOK.,Her memory for it. With three hundred pounds
2380,SECOND BOOK.,"We buy in England even, clear standing-room"
2381,SECOND BOOK.,"To stand and work in. Only two hours since,"
2382,SECOND BOOK.,I fancied I was poor.’
2383,SECOND BOOK.,"‘And, cousin, still"
2384,SECOND BOOK.,"You’re richer than you fancy. The will says,"
2385,SECOND BOOK.,"_Three hundred pounds, and any other sum"
2386,SECOND BOOK.,Of which the said testatrix dies possessed_.
2387,SECOND BOOK.,I say she died possessed of other sums.’
2388,SECOND BOOK.,
2389,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Dear Romney, need we chronicle the pence?"
2390,SECOND BOOK.,I’m richer than I thought—that’s evident.
2391,SECOND BOOK.,Enough so.’
2392,SECOND BOOK.,‘Listen rather. You’ve to do
2393,SECOND BOOK.,"With business and a cousin,’ he resumed,"
2394,SECOND BOOK.,"‘And both, I fear, need patience. Here’s the fact."
2395,SECOND BOOK.,"The other sum (there _is_ another sum,"
2396,SECOND BOOK.,Unspecified in any will which dates
2397,SECOND BOOK.,"After possession, yet bequeathed as much"
2398,SECOND BOOK.,And clearly as those said three hundred pounds)
2399,SECOND BOOK.,Is thirty thousand. You will have it paid
2400,SECOND BOOK.,When?... where? My duty troubles you with words.’
2401,SECOND BOOK.,
2402,SECOND BOOK.,He struck the iron when the bar was hot;
2403,SECOND BOOK.,No wonder if my eyes sent out some sparks.
2404,SECOND BOOK.,‘Pause there! I thank you. You are delicate
2405,SECOND BOOK.,"In glosing gifts;—but I, who share your blood,"
2406,SECOND BOOK.,"Am rather made for giving, like yourself,"
2407,SECOND BOOK.,"Than taking, like your pensioners. Farewell.’"
2408,SECOND BOOK.,
2409,SECOND BOOK.,He stopped me with a gesture of calm pride.
2410,SECOND BOOK.,"‘A Leigh,’ he said, ‘gives largesse and gives love,"
2411,SECOND BOOK.,"But gloses neither: if a Leigh could glose,"
2412,SECOND BOOK.,"He would not do it, moreover, to a Leigh,"
2413,SECOND BOOK.,With blood trained up along nine centuries
2414,SECOND BOOK.,"To hound and hate a lie, from eyes like yours."
2415,SECOND BOOK.,And now we’ll make the rest as clear; your aunt
2416,SECOND BOOK.,Possessed these monies.’
2417,SECOND BOOK.,"‘You will make it clear,"
2418,SECOND BOOK.,"My cousin, as the honour of us both,"
2419,SECOND BOOK.,Or one of us speaks vainly—that’s not I.
2420,SECOND BOOK.,"My aunt possessed this sum,—inherited"
2421,SECOND BOOK.,"From whom, and when? bring documents, prove dates.’"
2422,SECOND BOOK.,
2423,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Why now indeed you throw your bonnet off,"
2424,SECOND BOOK.,As if you had time left for a logarithm!
2425,SECOND BOOK.,"The faith’s the want. Dear cousin, give me faith,"
2426,SECOND BOOK.,"And you shall walk this road with silken shoes,"
2427,SECOND BOOK.,As clean as any lady of our house
2428,SECOND BOOK.,"Supposed the proudest. Oh, I comprehend"
2429,SECOND BOOK.,The whole position from your point of sight.
2430,SECOND BOOK.,"I oust you from your father’s halls and lands,"
2431,SECOND BOOK.,And make you poor by getting rich—that’s law;
2432,SECOND BOOK.,"Considering which, in common circumstance,"
2433,SECOND BOOK.,You would not scruple to accept from me
2434,SECOND BOOK.,"Some compensation, some sufficiency"
2435,SECOND BOOK.,"Of income—that were justice; but, alas,"
2436,SECOND BOOK.,I love you ... that’s mere nature!—you reject
2437,SECOND BOOK.,"My love ... that’s nature also;—and at once,"
2438,SECOND BOOK.,"You cannot, from a suitor disallowed,"
2439,SECOND BOOK.,"A hand thrown back as mine is, into yours"
2440,SECOND BOOK.,"Receive a doit, a farthing, ... not for the world!"
2441,SECOND BOOK.,"That’s etiquette with women, obviously"
2442,SECOND BOOK.,"Exceeding claim of nature, law, and right,"
2443,SECOND BOOK.,"Unanswerable to all. I grant, you see,"
2444,SECOND BOOK.,"The case as you conceive it,—leave you room"
2445,SECOND BOOK.,To sweep your ample skirts of womanhood;
2446,SECOND BOOK.,"While, standing humbly squeezed against the wall,"
2447,SECOND BOOK.,"I own myself excluded from being just,"
2448,SECOND BOOK.,"Restrained from paying indubitable debts,"
2449,SECOND BOOK.,Because denied from giving you my soul—
2450,SECOND BOOK.,That’s my misfortune!—I submit to it
2451,SECOND BOOK.,"As if, in some more reasonable age,"
2452,SECOND BOOK.,’Twould not be less inevitable. Enough.
2453,SECOND BOOK.,"You’ll trust me, cousin, as a gentleman,"
2454,SECOND BOOK.,"To keep your honour, as you count it, pure,—"
2455,SECOND BOOK.,Your scruples (just as if I thought them wise)
2456,SECOND BOOK.,Safe and inviolate from gifts of mine.’
2457,SECOND BOOK.,
2458,SECOND BOOK.,I answered mild but earnest. ‘I believe
2459,SECOND BOOK.,"In no one’s honour which another keeps,"
2460,SECOND BOOK.,"Nor man’s nor woman’s. As I keep, myself,"
2461,SECOND BOOK.,"My truth and my religion, I depute"
2462,SECOND BOOK.,"No father, though I had one this side death,"
2463,SECOND BOOK.,"Nor brother, though I had twenty, much less you,"
2464,SECOND BOOK.,"Though twice my cousin, and once Romney Leigh,"
2465,SECOND BOOK.,"To keep my honour pure. You face, to-day,"
2466,SECOND BOOK.,"A man who wants instruction, mark me, not"
2467,SECOND BOOK.,"A woman who wants protection. As to a man,"
2468,SECOND BOOK.,"Show manhood, speak out plainly, be precise"
2469,SECOND BOOK.,With facts and dates. My aunt inherited
2470,SECOND BOOK.,"This sum, you say—’"
2471,SECOND BOOK.,‘I said she died possessed
2472,SECOND BOOK.,"Of this, dear cousin.’"
2473,SECOND BOOK.,‘Not by heritage.
2474,SECOND BOOK.,Thank you: we’re getting to the facts at last.
2475,SECOND BOOK.,Perhaps she played at commerce with a ship
2476,SECOND BOOK.,Which came in heavy with Australian gold?
2477,SECOND BOOK.,"Or touched a lottery with her finger-end,"
2478,SECOND BOOK.,Which tumbled on a sudden into her lap
2479,SECOND BOOK.,Some old Rhine tower or principality?
2480,SECOND BOOK.,Perhaps she had to do with a marine
2481,SECOND BOOK.,"Sub-transatlantic railroad, which pre-pays"
2482,SECOND BOOK.,As well as pre-supposes? or perhaps
2483,SECOND BOOK.,Some stale ancestral debt was after-paid
2484,SECOND BOOK.,"By a hundred years, and took her by surprise?—"
2485,SECOND BOOK.,You shake your head my cousin; I guess ill.’
2486,SECOND BOOK.,
2487,SECOND BOOK.,"‘You need not guess, Aurora, nor deride,—"
2488,SECOND BOOK.,The truth is not afraid of hurting you.
2489,SECOND BOOK.,"You’ll find no cause, in all your scruples, why"
2490,SECOND BOOK.,Your aunt should cavil at a deed of gift
2491,SECOND BOOK.,’Twixt her and me.’
2492,SECOND BOOK.,‘I thought so—ah! a gift.’
2493,SECOND BOOK.,
2494,SECOND BOOK.,"‘You naturally thought so,’ he resumed."
2495,SECOND BOOK.,‘A very natural gift.’
2496,SECOND BOOK.,"‘A gift, a gift!"
2497,SECOND BOOK.,Her individual life being stranded high
2498,SECOND BOOK.,"Above all want, approaching opulence,"
2499,SECOND BOOK.,Too haughty was she to accept a gift
2500,SECOND BOOK.,"Without some ultimate aim: ah, ah, I see,—"
2501,SECOND BOOK.,"A gift intended plainly for her heirs,"
2502,SECOND BOOK.,"And so accepted ... if accepted ... ah,"
2503,SECOND BOOK.,"Indeed that might be; I am snared perhaps,"
2504,SECOND BOOK.,"Just so. But, cousin, shall I pardon you,"
2505,SECOND BOOK.,If thus you have caught me with a cruel springe?’
2506,SECOND BOOK.,
2507,SECOND BOOK.,"He answered gently, ‘Need you tremble and pant"
2508,SECOND BOOK.,"Like a netted lioness? is’t my fault, mine,"
2509,SECOND BOOK.,"That you’re a grand wild creature of the woods,"
2510,SECOND BOOK.,"And hate the stall built for you? Any way,"
2511,SECOND BOOK.,"Though triply netted, need you glare at me?"
2512,SECOND BOOK.,I do not hold the cords of such a net;
2513,SECOND BOOK.,"You’re free from me, Aurora!’"
2514,SECOND BOOK.,‘Now may God
2515,SECOND BOOK.,Deliver me from this strait! This gift of yours
2516,SECOND BOOK.,Was tendered ... when? accepted ... when?’ I asked.
2517,SECOND BOOK.,‘A month ... a fortnight since? Six weeks ago
2518,SECOND BOOK.,"It was not tendered. By a word she dropped,"
2519,SECOND BOOK.,I know it was not tendered nor received.
2520,SECOND BOOK.,When was it? bring your dates.’
2521,SECOND BOOK.,‘What matters when?
2522,SECOND BOOK.,"A half-hour ere she died, or a half-year,"
2523,SECOND BOOK.,"Secured the gift, maintains the heritage"
2524,SECOND BOOK.,Inviolable with law. As easy pluck
2525,SECOND BOOK.,"The golden stars from heaven’s embroidered stole,"
2526,SECOND BOOK.,"To pin them on the grey side of this earth,"
2527,SECOND BOOK.,"As make you poor again, thank God.’"
2528,SECOND BOOK.,‘Not poor
2529,SECOND BOOK.,"Nor clean again from henceforth, you thank God?"
2530,SECOND BOOK.,"Well, sir—I ask you ... I insist at need, ..."
2531,SECOND BOOK.,"Vouchsafe the special date, the special date.’"
2532,SECOND BOOK.,
2533,SECOND BOOK.,"‘The day before her death-day,’ he replied,"
2534,SECOND BOOK.,"‘The gift was in her hands. We’ll find that deed,"
2535,SECOND BOOK.,And certify that date to you.’
2536,SECOND BOOK.,As one
2537,SECOND BOOK.,Who has climbed a mountain-height and carried up
2538,SECOND BOOK.,"His own heart climbing, panting in his throat"
2539,SECOND BOOK.,"With the toil of the ascent, takes breath at last,"
2540,SECOND BOOK.,Looks back in triumph—so I stood and looked:
2541,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Dear cousin Romney, we have reached the top"
2542,SECOND BOOK.,"Of this steep question, and may rest, I think."
2543,SECOND BOOK.,"But first,—I pray you pardon, that the shock"
2544,SECOND BOOK.,And surge of natural feeling and event
2545,SECOND BOOK.,Had made me oblivious of acquainting you
2546,SECOND BOOK.,"That this, this letter ... unread, mark,—still sealed,"
2547,SECOND BOOK.,Was found enfolded in the poor dead hand:
2548,SECOND BOOK.,"That spirit of hers had gone beyond the address,"
2549,SECOND BOOK.,"Which could not find her though you wrote it clear,—"
2550,SECOND BOOK.,"I know your writing, Romney,—recognise"
2551,SECOND BOOK.,"The open-hearted _A_, the liberal sweep"
2552,SECOND BOOK.,"Of the _G_. Now listen,—let us understand;"
2553,SECOND BOOK.,"You will not find that famous deed of gift,"
2554,SECOND BOOK.,"Unless you find it in the letter here,"
2555,SECOND BOOK.,"Which, not being mine, I give you back.—Refuse"
2556,SECOND BOOK.,"To take the letter? well then—you and I,"
2557,SECOND BOOK.,"As writer and as heiress, open it"
2558,SECOND BOOK.,"Together, by your leave.—Exactly so:"
2559,SECOND BOOK.,"The words in which the noble offering’s made,"
2560,SECOND BOOK.,"Are nobler still, my cousin; and, I own,"
2561,SECOND BOOK.,"The proudest and most delicate heart alive,"
2562,SECOND BOOK.,Distracted from the measure of the gift
2563,SECOND BOOK.,"By such a grace in giving, might accept"
2564,SECOND BOOK.,Your largesse without thinking any more
2565,SECOND BOOK.,"Of the burthen of it, than King Solomon"
2566,SECOND BOOK.,"Considered, when he wore his holy ring"
2567,SECOND BOOK.,"Charáctered over with the ineffable spell,"
2568,SECOND BOOK.,How many carats of fine gold made up
2569,SECOND BOOK.,"Its money-value. So, Leigh gives to Leigh—"
2570,SECOND BOOK.,"Or rather, might have given, observe!—for that’s"
2571,SECOND BOOK.,"The point we come to. Here’s a proof of gift,"
2572,SECOND BOOK.,"But here’s no proof, sir, of acceptancy,"
2573,SECOND BOOK.,"But rather, disproof. Death’s black dust, being blown,"
2574,SECOND BOOK.,Infiltrated through every secret fold
2575,SECOND BOOK.,"Of this sealed letter by a puff of fate,"
2576,SECOND BOOK.,"Dried up for ever the fresh-written ink,"
2577,SECOND BOOK.,"Annulled the gift, disutilised the grace,"
2578,SECOND BOOK.,And left these fragments.’
2579,SECOND BOOK.,"As I spoke, I tore"
2580,SECOND BOOK.,"The paper up and down, and down and up"
2581,SECOND BOOK.,"And crosswise, till it fluttered from my hands,"
2582,SECOND BOOK.,"As forest-leaves, stripped suddenly and rapt"
2583,SECOND BOOK.,"By a whirlwind on Valdarno, drop again,"
2584,SECOND BOOK.,"Drop slow, and strew the melancholy ground"
2585,SECOND BOOK.,"Before the amazèd hills ... why, so, indeed,"
2586,SECOND BOOK.,"I’m writing like a poet, somewhat large"
2587,SECOND BOOK.,"In the type of the image,—and exaggerate"
2588,SECOND BOOK.,"A small thing with a great thing, topping it!—"
2589,SECOND BOOK.,"But then I’m thinking how his eyes looked ... his,"
2590,SECOND BOOK.,With what despondent and surprised reproach!
2591,SECOND BOOK.,"I think the tears were in them, as he looked—"
2592,SECOND BOOK.,I think the manly mouth just trembled. Then
2593,SECOND BOOK.,He broke the silence.
2594,SECOND BOOK.,"‘I may ask, perhaps,"
2595,SECOND BOOK.,"Although no stranger ... only Romney Leigh,"
2596,SECOND BOOK.,Which means still less ... than Vincent Carrington ...
2597,SECOND BOOK.,"Your plans in going hence, and where you go."
2598,SECOND BOOK.,This cannot be a secret.’
2599,SECOND BOOK.,‘All my life
2600,SECOND BOOK.,"Is open to you, cousin. I go hence"
2601,SECOND BOOK.,"To London, to the gathering-place of souls,"
2602,SECOND BOOK.,"To live mine straight out, vocally, in books;"
2603,SECOND BOOK.,"Harmoniously for others, if indeed"
2604,SECOND BOOK.,"A woman’s soul, like man’s, be wide enough"
2605,SECOND BOOK.,To carry the whole octave (that’s to prove)
2606,SECOND BOOK.,"Or, if I fail, still, purely for myself."
2607,SECOND BOOK.,"Pray God be with me, Romney.’"
2608,SECOND BOOK.,"‘Ah, poor child,"
2609,SECOND BOOK.,"Who fight against the mother’s ‘tiring hand,"
2610,SECOND BOOK.,And choose the headsman’s! May God change his world
2611,SECOND BOOK.,"For your sake, sweet, and make it mild as heaven,"
2612,SECOND BOOK.,And juster than I have found you!’
2613,SECOND BOOK.,But I paused.
2614,SECOND BOOK.,"‘And you, my cousin?’—"
2615,SECOND BOOK.,"‘I,’ he said,—‘you ask?"
2616,SECOND BOOK.,"You care to ask? Well, girls have curious minds,"
2617,SECOND BOOK.,"And fain would know the end of everything,"
2618,SECOND BOOK.,"Of cousins, therefore, with the rest. For me,"
2619,SECOND BOOK.,"Aurora, I’ve my work; you know my work;"
2620,SECOND BOOK.,"And, having missed this year some personal hope,"
2621,SECOND BOOK.,I must beware the rather that I miss
2622,SECOND BOOK.,No reasonable duty. While you sing
2623,SECOND BOOK.,"Your happy pastorals of the meads and trees,"
2624,SECOND BOOK.,Bethink you that I go to impress and prove
2625,SECOND BOOK.,"On stifled brains and deafened ears, stunned deaf,"
2626,SECOND BOOK.,"Crushed dull with grief, that nature sings itself,"
2627,SECOND BOOK.,"And needs no mediate poet, lute or voice,"
2628,SECOND BOOK.,To make it vocal. While you ask of men
2629,SECOND BOOK.,"Your audience, I may get their leave perhaps"
2630,SECOND BOOK.,For hungry orphans to say audibly
2631,SECOND BOOK.,"‘We’re hungry, see,’—for beaten and bullied wives"
2632,SECOND BOOK.,"To hold their unweaned babies up in sight,"
2633,SECOND BOOK.,Whom orphanage would better; and for all
2634,SECOND BOOK.,To speak and claim their portion ... by no means
2635,SECOND BOOK.,"Of the soil, ... but of the sweat in tilling it,—"
2636,SECOND BOOK.,"Since this is now-a-days turned privilege,"
2637,SECOND BOOK.,"To have only God’s curse on us, and not man’s."
2638,SECOND BOOK.,"Such work I have for doing, elbow-deep"
2639,SECOND BOOK.,"In social problems,—as you tie your rhymes,"
2640,SECOND BOOK.,"To draw my uses to cohere with needs,"
2641,SECOND BOOK.,And bring the uneven world back to its round;
2642,SECOND BOOK.,"Or, failing so much, fill up, bridge at least"
2643,SECOND BOOK.,"To smoother issues, some abysmal cracks"
2644,SECOND BOOK.,"And feuds of earth, intestine heats have made"
2645,SECOND BOOK.,"To keep men separate,—using sorry shifts"
2646,SECOND BOOK.,"Of hospitals, almshouses, infant schools,"
2647,SECOND BOOK.,"And other practical stuff of partial good,"
2648,SECOND BOOK.,"You lovers of the beautiful and whole,"
2649,SECOND BOOK.,Despise by system.’
2650,SECOND BOOK.,‘_I_ despise? The scorn
2651,SECOND BOOK.,"Is yours, my cousin. Poets become such,"
2652,SECOND BOOK.,Through scorning nothing. You decry them for
2653,SECOND BOOK.,"The good of beauty, sung and taught by them,"
2654,SECOND BOOK.,While they respect your practical partial good
2655,SECOND BOOK.,As being a part of beauty’s self. Adieu!
2656,SECOND BOOK.,"When God helps all the workers for his world,"
2657,SECOND BOOK.,"The singers shall have help of Him, not last.’"
2658,SECOND BOOK.,
2659,SECOND BOOK.,He smiled as men smile when they will not speak
2660,SECOND BOOK.,Because of something bitter in the thought;
2661,SECOND BOOK.,And still I feel his melancholy eyes
2662,SECOND BOOK.,Look judgment on me. It is seven years since:
2663,SECOND BOOK.,I know not if ’twas pity or ’twas scorn
2664,SECOND BOOK.,Has made them so far-reaching: judge it ye
2665,SECOND BOOK.,Who have had to do with pity more than love.
2666,SECOND BOOK.,"And scorn than hatred. I am used, since then,"
2667,SECOND BOOK.,"To other ways, from equal men. But so,"
2668,SECOND BOOK.,"Even so, we let go hands, my cousin and I,"
2669,SECOND BOOK.,"And, in between us, rushed the torrent-world"
2670,SECOND BOOK.,"To blanch our faces like divided rocks,"
2671,SECOND BOOK.,And bar for ever mutual sight and touch
2672,SECOND BOOK.,Except through swirl of spray and all that roar.

2681,THIRD BOOK.,And goest where thou wouldest: presently
2682,THIRD BOOK.,"Others shall gird thee,’ said the Lord, ‘to go"
2683,THIRD BOOK.,"Where thou would’st not.’ He spoke to Peter thus,"
2684,THIRD BOOK.,To signify the death which he should die
2685,THIRD BOOK.,When crucified head downwards.
2686,THIRD BOOK.,If He spoke
2687,THIRD BOOK.,"To Peter then, He speaks to us the same;"
2688,THIRD BOOK.,"The word suits many different martyrdoms,"

2690,THIRD BOOK.,"Although we scarcely die apostles, we,"

2692,THIRD BOOK.,
2693,THIRD BOOK.,For ’tis not in mere death that men die most;

2704,THIRD BOOK.,Yet He can pluck us from that shameful cross.

2712,THIRD BOOK.,"Tease me like gnats. Ah, letters! throw them down"
2713,THIRD BOOK.,"At once, as I must have them, to be sure,"

2715,THIRD BOOK.,"At such an hour, or bid you. No excuse."
2716,THIRD BOOK.,"You choose to bring them, as I choose perhaps"
2717,THIRD BOOK.,"To throw them in the fire. Now, get to bed,"
2718,THIRD BOOK.,"And dream, if possible, I am not cross."
2719,THIRD BOOK.,
2720,THIRD BOOK.,"Why what a pettish, petty thing I grow,—"
2721,THIRD BOOK.,"A mere, mere woman,—a mere flaccid nerve,—"
2722,THIRD BOOK.,"A kerchief left out all night in the rain,"
2723,THIRD BOOK.,"Turned soft so,—overtasked and overstrained"

2800,THIRD BOOK.,"Stands high upon the brink of theories,"
2801,THIRD BOOK.,"Observes the swimmers, and cries ‘Very fine,’"
2802,THIRD BOOK.,"But keeps dry linen equally,—unlike"
2803,THIRD BOOK.,"That gallant breaster, Romney. Strange it is,"
2804,THIRD BOOK.,"Such sudden madness seizing a young man,"
2805,THIRD BOOK.,"To make earth over again,—while I’m content"
2806,THIRD BOOK.,To make the pictures. Let me bring the sketch.
2807,THIRD BOOK.,"A tiptoe Danae, overbold and hot;"
2808,THIRD BOOK.,Both arms a-flame to meet her wishing Jove
2809,THIRD BOOK.,"Halfway, and burn him faster down; the face"
2810,THIRD BOOK.,"And breasts upturned and straining, the loose locks"
2811,THIRD BOOK.,All glowing with the anticipated gold.
2812,THIRD BOOK.,Or here’s another on the self-same theme.
2813,THIRD BOOK.,"She lies here—flat upon her prison-floor,"
2814,THIRD BOOK.,"The long hair swathed about her to the heel,"
2815,THIRD BOOK.,Like wet sea-weed. You dimly see her through
2816,THIRD BOOK.,"The glittering haze of that prodigious rain,"
2817,THIRD BOOK.,Half blotted out of nature by a love
2818,THIRD BOOK.,As heavy as fate. I’ll bring you either sketch.
2819,THIRD BOOK.,"I think, myself, the second indicates"
2820,THIRD BOOK.,More passion.’
2821,THIRD BOOK.,"Surely. Self is put away,"
2822,THIRD BOOK.,"And calm with abdication. She is Jove,"
2823,THIRD BOOK.,And no more Danae—greater thus. Perhaps
2824,THIRD BOOK.,The painter symbolises unawares
2825,THIRD BOOK.,Two states of the recipient artist-soul;
2826,THIRD BOOK.,"One, forward, personal, wanting reverence,"
2827,THIRD BOOK.,"Because aspiring only. We’ll be calm,"
2828,THIRD BOOK.,"And know that, when indeed our Joves come down,"
2829,THIRD BOOK.,We all turn stiller than we have ever been.
2830,THIRD BOOK.,
2831,THIRD BOOK.,Kind Vincent Carrington. I’ll let him come.
2832,THIRD BOOK.,"He talks of Florence,—and may say a word"
2833,THIRD BOOK.,"Of something as it chanced seven years ago,—"
2834,THIRD BOOK.,"A hedgehog in the path, or a lame bird,"
2835,THIRD BOOK.,"In those green country walks, in that good time,"
2836,THIRD BOOK.,When certainly I was so miserable ...
2837,THIRD BOOK.,I seem to have missed a blessing ever since.
2838,THIRD BOOK.,
2839,THIRD BOOK.,"The music soars within the little lark,"
2840,THIRD BOOK.,And the lark soars. It is not thus with men.
2841,THIRD BOOK.,"We do not make our places with our strains,—"
2842,THIRD BOOK.,"Content, while they rise, to remain behind,"
2843,THIRD BOOK.,Alone on earth instead of so in heaven.
2844,THIRD BOOK.,No matter—I bear on my broken tale.
2845,THIRD BOOK.,
2846,THIRD BOOK.,"When Romney Leigh and I had parted thus,"
2847,THIRD BOOK.,I took a chamber up three flights of stairs
2848,THIRD BOOK.,"Not far from being as steep as some larks climb,"
2849,THIRD BOOK.,"And, in a certain house in Kensington,"
2850,THIRD BOOK.,Three years I lived and worked. Get leave to work
2851,THIRD BOOK.,"In this world,—’tis the best you get at all;"
2852,THIRD BOOK.,"For God, in cursing, gives us better gifts"
2853,THIRD BOOK.,"Than men in benediction. God says, ‘Sweat"
2854,THIRD BOOK.,"For foreheads;’ men say ‘crowns;’ and so we are crowned,—"
2855,THIRD BOOK.,"Ay, gashed by some tormenting circle of steel"
2856,THIRD BOOK.,"Which snaps with a secret spring. Get work, get work;"
2857,THIRD BOOK.,Be sure ’tis better than what you work to get.
2858,THIRD BOOK.,
2859,THIRD BOOK.,"So, happy and unafraid of solitude,"
2860,THIRD BOOK.,"I worked the short days out,—and watched the sun"
2861,THIRD BOOK.,"On lurid morns or monstrous afternoons,"
2862,THIRD BOOK.,"Like some Druidic idol’s fiery brass,"
2863,THIRD BOOK.,"With fixed unflickering outline of dead heat,"
2864,THIRD BOOK.,In which the blood of wretches pent inside
2865,THIRD BOOK.,"Seemed oozing forth to incarnadine the air,—"
2866,THIRD BOOK.,"Push out through fog with his dilated disk,"
2867,THIRD BOOK.,And startle the slant roofs and chimney-pots
2868,THIRD BOOK.,With splashes of fierce colour. Or I saw
2869,THIRD BOOK.,"Fog only, the great tawny weltering fog,"
2870,THIRD BOOK.,"Involve the passive city, strangle it"
2871,THIRD BOOK.,"Alive, and draw it off into the void,"
2872,THIRD BOOK.,"Spires, bridges, streets, and squares, as if a spunge"
2873,THIRD BOOK.,"Had wiped out London,—or as noon and night"
2874,THIRD BOOK.,Had clapped together and utterly struck out
2875,THIRD BOOK.,"The intermediate time, undoing themselves"
2876,THIRD BOOK.,"In the act. Your city poets see such things,"
2877,THIRD BOOK.,"Not despicable. Mountains of the south,"
2878,THIRD BOOK.,"When, drunk and mad with elemental wines,"
2879,THIRD BOOK.,"They rend the seamless mist and stand up bare,"
2880,THIRD BOOK.,"Make fewer singers, haply. No one sings,"
2881,THIRD BOOK.,"Descending Sinai: on Parnassus mount,"
2882,THIRD BOOK.,"You take a mule to climb, and not a muse,"
2883,THIRD BOOK.,Except in fable and figure: forests chant
2884,THIRD BOOK.,"Their anthems to themselves, and leave you dumb."
2885,THIRD BOOK.,"But sit in London, at the day’s decline,"
2886,THIRD BOOK.,And view the city perish in the mist
2887,THIRD BOOK.,"Like Pharaoh’s armaments in the deep Red Sea,—"
2888,THIRD BOOK.,"The chariots, horsemen, footmen, all the host,"
2889,THIRD BOOK.,"Sucked down and choked to silence—then, surprised"
2890,THIRD BOOK.,"By a sudden sense of vision and of tune,"
2891,THIRD BOOK.,"You feel as conquerors though you did not fight,"
2892,THIRD BOOK.,"And you and Israel’s other singing girls,"
2893,THIRD BOOK.,"Ay, Miriam with them, sing the song you choose."
2894,THIRD BOOK.,
2895,THIRD BOOK.,I worked with patience which means almost power.
2896,THIRD BOOK.,"I did some excellent things indifferently,"
2897,THIRD BOOK.,"Some bad things excellently. Both were praised,"
2898,THIRD BOOK.,The latter loudest. And by such a time
2899,THIRD BOOK.,That I myself had set them down as sins
2900,THIRD BOOK.,"Scarce worth the price of sackcloth, week by week,"
2901,THIRD BOOK.,"Arrived some letter through the sedulous post,"
2902,THIRD BOOK.,"Like these I’ve read, and yet dissimilar,"
2903,THIRD BOOK.,"With pretty maiden seals,—initials twined"
2904,THIRD BOOK.,"Of lilies, or a heart marked _Emily_,"
2905,THIRD BOOK.,(Convicting Emily of being all heart);
2906,THIRD BOOK.,"Or rarer tokens from young bachelors,"
2907,THIRD BOOK.,"Who wrote from college (with the same goosequill,"
2908,THIRD BOOK.,"Suppose, they had just been plucked of) and a snatch"
2909,THIRD BOOK.,"From Horace, ‘Collegisse juvat,’ set"
2910,THIRD BOOK.,Upon the first page. Many a letter signed
2911,THIRD BOOK.,"Or unsigned, showing the writers at eighteen"
2912,THIRD BOOK.,"Had lived too long, though every muse should help"
2913,THIRD BOOK.,"The daylight, holding candles,—compliments,"
2914,THIRD BOOK.,To smile or sigh at. Such could pass with me
2915,THIRD BOOK.,No more than coins from Moscow circulate
2916,THIRD BOOK.,At Paris. Would ten roubles buy a tag
2917,THIRD BOOK.,"Of ribbon on the boulevard, worth a sou?"
2918,THIRD BOOK.,"I smiled that all this youth should love me,—sighed"
2919,THIRD BOOK.,That such a love could scarcely raise them up
2920,THIRD BOOK.,To love what was more worthy than myself;
2921,THIRD BOOK.,"Then sighed again, again, less generously,"
2922,THIRD BOOK.,"To think the very love they lavished so,"
2923,THIRD BOOK.,"Proved me inferior. The strong loved me not,"
2924,THIRD BOOK.,And he ... my cousin Romney ... did not write.
2925,THIRD BOOK.,I felt the silent finger of his scorn
2926,THIRD BOOK.,Prick every bubble of my frivolous fame
2927,THIRD BOOK.,"As my breath blew it, and resolve it back"
2928,THIRD BOOK.,"To the air it came from. Oh, I justified"
2929,THIRD BOOK.,The measure he had taken of my height:
2930,THIRD BOOK.,The thing was plain—he was not wrong a line;
2931,THIRD BOOK.,"I played at art, made thrusts with a toy-sword,"
2932,THIRD BOOK.,Amused the lads and maidens.
2933,THIRD BOOK.,Came a sigh
2934,THIRD BOOK.,"Deep, hoarse with resolution,—I would work"
2935,THIRD BOOK.,"To better ends, or play in earnest. ‘Heavens,"
2936,THIRD BOOK.,I think I should be almost popular
2937,THIRD BOOK.,"If this went on!’—I ripped my verses up,"
2938,THIRD BOOK.,And found no blood upon the rapier’s point;
2939,THIRD BOOK.,"The heart in them was just an embryo’s heart,"
2940,THIRD BOOK.,"Which never yet had beat, that it should die;"
2941,THIRD BOOK.,Just gasps of make-believe galvanic life;
2942,THIRD BOOK.,"Mere tones, inorganised to any tune."
2943,THIRD BOOK.,
2944,THIRD BOOK.,"And yet I felt it in me where it burnt,"
2945,THIRD BOOK.,Like those hot fire-seeds of creation held
2946,THIRD BOOK.,"In Jove’s clenched palm before the worlds were sown,—"
2947,THIRD BOOK.,But I—I was not Juno even! my hand
2948,THIRD BOOK.,"Was shut in weak convulsion, woman’s ill,"
2949,THIRD BOOK.,"And when I yearned to loose a finger—lo,"
2950,THIRD BOOK.,The nerve revolted. ’Tis the same even now:
2951,THIRD BOOK.,"This hand may never, haply, open large,"
2952,THIRD BOOK.,"Before the spark is quenched, or the palm charred,"
2953,THIRD BOOK.,To prove the power not else than by the pain.
2954,THIRD BOOK.,
2955,THIRD BOOK.,"It burns, it burnt—my whole life burnt with it,"
2956,THIRD BOOK.,"And light, not sunlight and not torchlight, flashed"
2957,THIRD BOOK.,My steps out through the slow and difficult road.
2958,THIRD BOOK.,"I had grown distrustful of too forward Springs,"
2959,THIRD BOOK.,The season’s books in drear significance
2960,THIRD BOOK.,"Of morals, dropping round me. Lively books?"
2961,THIRD BOOK.,The ash has livelier verdure than the yew;
2962,THIRD BOOK.,"And yet the yew’s green longer, and alone"
2963,THIRD BOOK.,Found worthy of the holy Christmas time.
2964,THIRD BOOK.,"We’ll plant more yews if possible, albeit"
2965,THIRD BOOK.,We plant the graveyards with them.
2966,THIRD BOOK.,Day and night
2967,THIRD BOOK.,"I worked my rhythmic thought, and furrowed up"
2968,THIRD BOOK.,Both watch and slumber with long lines of life
2969,THIRD BOOK.,Which did not suit their season. The rose fell
2970,THIRD BOOK.,"From either cheek, my eyes globed luminous"
2971,THIRD BOOK.,"Through orbits of blue shadow, and my pulse"
2972,THIRD BOOK.,Would shudder along the purple-veined wrist
2973,THIRD BOOK.,"Like a shot bird. Youth’s stern, set face to face"
2974,THIRD BOOK.,With youth’s ideal: and when people came
2975,THIRD BOOK.,"And said, ‘You work too much, you are looking ill,’"
2976,THIRD BOOK.,"I smiled for pity of them who pitied me,"
2977,THIRD BOOK.,And thought I should be better soon perhaps
2978,THIRD BOOK.,"For those ill looks. Observe—‘I,’ means in youth"
2979,THIRD BOOK.,Just _I_ ... the conscious and eternal soul
2980,THIRD BOOK.,"With all its ends,—and not the outside life,"
2981,THIRD BOOK.,"The parcel-man, the doublet of the flesh,"
2982,THIRD BOOK.,"The so much liver, lung, integument,"
2983,THIRD BOOK.,"Which make the sum of ‘I’ hereafter, when"
2984,THIRD BOOK.,World-talkers talk of doing well or ill.
2985,THIRD BOOK.,"_I_ prosper, if I gain a step, although"
2986,THIRD BOOK.,A nail then pierced my foot: although my brain
2987,THIRD BOOK.,"Embracing any truth, froze paralysed,"
2988,THIRD BOOK.,_I_ prosper. I but change my instrument;
2989,THIRD BOOK.,"I break the spade off, digging deep for gold,"
2990,THIRD BOOK.,And catch the mattock up.
2991,THIRD BOOK.,"I worked on, on."
2992,THIRD BOOK.,Through all the bristling fence of nights and days
2993,THIRD BOOK.,"Which hedges time in from the eternities,"
2994,THIRD BOOK.,"I struggled, ... never stopped to note the stakes"
2995,THIRD BOOK.,Which hurt me in my course. The midnight oil
2996,THIRD BOOK.,Would stink sometimes; there came some vulgar needs:
2997,THIRD BOOK.,"I had to live, that therefore I might work,"
2998,THIRD BOOK.,"And, being but poor, I was constrained, for life,"
2999,THIRD BOOK.,"To work with one hand for the booksellers,"
3000,THIRD BOOK.,While working with the other for myself
3001,THIRD BOOK.,"And art. You swim with feet as well as hands,"
3002,THIRD BOOK.,"Or make small way. I apprehended this,—"
3003,THIRD BOOK.,"In England, no one lives by verse that lives;"
3004,THIRD BOOK.,"And, apprehending, I resolved by prose"
3005,THIRD BOOK.,To make a space to sphere my living verse.
3006,THIRD BOOK.,"I wrote for cyclopædias, magazines,"
3007,THIRD BOOK.,"And weekly papers, holding up my name"
3008,THIRD BOOK.,To keep it from the mud. I learnt the use
3009,THIRD BOOK.,"Of the editorial ‘we’ in a review,"
3010,THIRD BOOK.,"As courtly ladies the fine trick of trains,"
3011,THIRD BOOK.,And swept it grandly through the open doors
3012,THIRD BOOK.,As if one could not pass through doors at all
3013,THIRD BOOK.,"Save so encumbered. I wrote tales beside,"
3014,THIRD BOOK.,Carved many an article on cherry-stones
3015,THIRD BOOK.,"To suit light readers,—something in the lines"
3016,THIRD BOOK.,"Revealing, it was said, the mallet-hand,"
3017,THIRD BOOK.,"But that, I’ll never vouch for. What you do"
3018,THIRD BOOK.,"For bread, will taste of common grain, not grapes,"
3019,THIRD BOOK.,"Although you have a vineyard in Champagne,—"
3020,THIRD BOOK.,"Much less in Nephelococcygia,"
3021,THIRD BOOK.,"As mine was, peradventure."
3022,THIRD BOOK.,Having bread
3023,THIRD BOOK.,"For just so many days, just breathing room"
3024,THIRD BOOK.,"For body and verse, I stood up straight and worked"
3025,THIRD BOOK.,My veritable work. And as the soul
3026,THIRD BOOK.,"Which grows within a child, makes the child grow,—"
3027,THIRD BOOK.,"Or as the fiery sap, the touch from God,"
3028,THIRD BOOK.,"Careering through a tree, dilates the bark,"
3029,THIRD BOOK.,"And roughs with scale and knob, before it strikes"
3030,THIRD BOOK.,The summer foliage out in a green flame—
3031,THIRD BOOK.,"So life, in deepening with me, deepened all"
3032,THIRD BOOK.,"The course I took, the work I did. Indeed,"
3033,THIRD BOOK.,The academic law convinced of sin;
3034,THIRD BOOK.,"The critics cried out on the falling off,"
3035,THIRD BOOK.,Regretting the first manner. But I felt
3036,THIRD BOOK.,My heart’s life throbbing in my verse to show
3037,THIRD BOOK.,"It lived, it also—certes incomplete,"
3038,THIRD BOOK.,"Disordered with all Adam in the blood,"
3039,THIRD BOOK.,"But even its very tumours, warts, and wens,"
3040,THIRD BOOK.,"Still organised by, and implying life."
3041,THIRD BOOK.,
3042,THIRD BOOK.,A lady called upon me on such a day.
3043,THIRD BOOK.,"She had the low voice of your English dames,"
3044,THIRD BOOK.,"Unused, it seems, to need rise half a note"
3045,THIRD BOOK.,"To catch attention,—and their quiet mood,"
3046,THIRD BOOK.,As if they lived too high above the earth
3047,THIRD BOOK.,For that to put them out in anything:
3048,THIRD BOOK.,"So gentle, because verily so proud;"
3049,THIRD BOOK.,"So wary and afeared of hurting you,"
3050,THIRD BOOK.,"By no means that you are not really vile,"
3051,THIRD BOOK.,But that they would not touch you with their foot
3052,THIRD BOOK.,To push you to your place; so self-possessed
3053,THIRD BOOK.,"Yet gracious and conciliating, it takes"
3054,THIRD BOOK.,An effort in their presence to speak truth:
3055,THIRD BOOK.,"You know the sort of woman,—brilliant stuff,"
3056,THIRD BOOK.,"And out of nature. ‘Lady Waldemar,’"
3057,THIRD BOOK.,"She said her name quite simply, as if it meant"
3058,THIRD BOOK.,"Not much indeed, but something,—took my hands,"
3059,THIRD BOOK.,"And smiled, as if her smile could help my case,"
3060,THIRD BOOK.,"And dropped her eyes on me, and let them melt."
3061,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Is this,’ she said, ‘the Muse?’"
3062,THIRD BOOK.,"‘No sybil even,’"
3063,THIRD BOOK.,"I answered, ‘since she fails to guess the cause"
3064,THIRD BOOK.,"Which taxed you with this visit, madam.’"
3065,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Good,’"
3066,THIRD BOOK.,"She said, ‘I like to be sincere at once;"
3067,THIRD BOOK.,"Perhaps, if I had found a literal Muse,"
3068,THIRD BOOK.,"The visit might have taxed me. As it is,"
3069,THIRD BOOK.,"You wear your blue so chiefly in your eyes,"
3070,THIRD BOOK.,"My fair Aurora, in a frank good way,"
3071,THIRD BOOK.,"It comforts me entirely for your fame,"
3072,THIRD BOOK.,As well as for the trouble of my ascent
3073,THIRD BOOK.,To this Olympus.’
3074,THIRD BOOK.,"There, a silver laugh"
3075,THIRD BOOK.,Ran rippling through her quickened little breaths
3076,THIRD BOOK.,The steep stair somewhat justified.
3077,THIRD BOOK.,‘But still
3078,THIRD BOOK.,Your ladyship has left me curious why
3079,THIRD BOOK.,You dared the risk of finding the said Muse?’
3080,THIRD BOOK.,
3081,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Ah,—keep me, notwithstanding, to the point,"
3082,THIRD BOOK.,Like any pedant. Is the blue in eyes
3083,THIRD BOOK.,"As awful as in stockings, after all,"
3084,THIRD BOOK.,"I wonder, that you’d have my business out"
3085,THIRD BOOK.,Before I breathe—exact the epic plunge
3086,THIRD BOOK.,"In spite of gasps? Well, naturally you think"
3087,THIRD BOOK.,"I’ve come here, as the lion-hunters go"
3088,THIRD BOOK.,"To deserts, to secure you, with a trap,"
3089,THIRD BOOK.,For exhibition in my drawing-rooms
3090,THIRD BOOK.,On zoologic soirées? Not in the least.
3091,THIRD BOOK.,"Roar softly at me; I am frivolous,"
3092,THIRD BOOK.,"I dare say; I have played at lions, too,"
3093,THIRD BOOK.,"Like other women of my class,—but now"
3094,THIRD BOOK.,I meet my lion simply as Androcles
3095,THIRD BOOK.,Met his ... when at his mercy.’
3096,THIRD BOOK.,"So, she bent"
3097,THIRD BOOK.,"Her head, as queens may mock,—then lifting up"
3098,THIRD BOOK.,"Her eyelids with a real grave queenly look,"
3099,THIRD BOOK.,"Which ruled, and would not spare, not even herself,—"
3100,THIRD BOOK.,‘I think you have a cousin:—Romney Leigh.’
3101,THIRD BOOK.,
3102,THIRD BOOK.,‘You bring a word from _him_?’—my eyes leapt up
3103,THIRD BOOK.,"To the very height of hers,—‘a word from _him_?’"
3104,THIRD BOOK.,
3105,THIRD BOOK.,"‘I bring a word about him, actually."
3106,THIRD BOOK.,"But first,’—she pressed me with her urgent eyes—"
3107,THIRD BOOK.,"‘You do not love him,—you?’"
3108,THIRD BOOK.,‘You’re frank at least
3109,THIRD BOOK.,"In putting questions, madam,’ I replied."
3110,THIRD BOOK.,‘I love my cousin cousinly—no more.’
3111,THIRD BOOK.,
3112,THIRD BOOK.,‘I guessed as much. I’m ready to be frank
3113,THIRD BOOK.,"In answering also, if you’ll question me,"
3114,THIRD BOOK.,"Or even with something less. You stand outside,"
3115,THIRD BOOK.,"You artist women, of the common sex;"
3116,THIRD BOOK.,"You share not with us, and exceed us so"
3117,THIRD BOOK.,"Perhaps by what you’re mulcted in, your hearts"
3118,THIRD BOOK.,Being starved to make your heads: so run the old
3119,THIRD BOOK.,"Traditions of you. I can therefore speak,"
3120,THIRD BOOK.,Without the natural shame which creatures feel
3121,THIRD BOOK.,"When speaking on their level, to their like."
3122,THIRD BOOK.,"There’s many a papist she, would rather die"
3123,THIRD BOOK.,Than own to her maid she put a ribbon on
3124,THIRD BOOK.,"To catch the indifferent eye of such a man,—"
3125,THIRD BOOK.,Who yet would count adulteries on her beads
3126,THIRD BOOK.,"At holy Mary’s shrine, and never blush;"
3127,THIRD BOOK.,"Because the saints are so far off, we lose"
3128,THIRD BOOK.,"All modesty before them. Thus, today."
3129,THIRD BOOK.,"’Tis _I_, love Romney Leigh.’"
3130,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Forbear,’ I cried."
3131,THIRD BOOK.,"‘If here’s no Muse, still less is any saint;"
3132,THIRD BOOK.,"Nor even a friend, that Lady Waldemar"
3133,THIRD BOOK.,Should make confessions’....
3134,THIRD BOOK.,‘That’s unkindly said.
3135,THIRD BOOK.,"If no friend, what forbids to make a friend"
3136,THIRD BOOK.,To join to our confession ere we have done?
3137,THIRD BOOK.,I love your cousin. If it seems unwise
3138,THIRD BOOK.,"To say so, it’s still foolisher (we’re frank)"
3139,THIRD BOOK.,"To feel so. My first husband left me young,"
3140,THIRD BOOK.,"And pretty enough, so please you, and rich enough,"
3141,THIRD BOOK.,To keep my booth in May-fair with the rest
3142,THIRD BOOK.,To happy issues. There are marquises
3143,THIRD BOOK.,"Would serve seven years to call me wife, I know:"
3144,THIRD BOOK.,"And, after seven, I might consider it,"
3145,THIRD BOOK.,For there’s some comfort in a marquisate
3146,THIRD BOOK.,"When all’s said,—yes, but after the seven years;"
3147,THIRD BOOK.,"I, now, love Romney. You put up your lip,"
3148,THIRD BOOK.,"So like a Leigh! so like him!—Pardon me,"
3149,THIRD BOOK.,I am well aware I do not derogate
3150,THIRD BOOK.,"In loving Romney Leigh. The name is good,"
3151,THIRD BOOK.,"The means are excellent; but the man, the man—"
3152,THIRD BOOK.,"Heaven help us both,—I am near as mad as he,"
3153,THIRD BOOK.,In loving such an one.’
3154,THIRD BOOK.,She slowly swung
3155,THIRD BOOK.,"Her heavy ringlets till they touched her smile,"
3156,THIRD BOOK.,As reasonably sorry for herself;
3157,THIRD BOOK.,"And thus continued,—"
3158,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Of a truth, Miss Leigh,"
3159,THIRD BOOK.,"I have not, without struggle, come to this."
3160,THIRD BOOK.,"I took a master in the German tongue,"
3161,THIRD BOOK.,"I gamed a little, went to Paris twice;"
3162,THIRD BOOK.,"But, after all, this love!... you eat of love,"
3163,THIRD BOOK.,And do as vile a thing as if you ate
3164,THIRD BOOK.,"Of garlic—which, whatever else you eat,"
3165,THIRD BOOK.,"Tastes uniformly acrid, till your peach"
3166,THIRD BOOK.,Reminds you of your onion. Am I coarse?
3167,THIRD BOOK.,"Well, love’s coarse, nature’s coarse—ah, there’s the rub!"
3168,THIRD BOOK.,"We fair fine ladies, who park out our lives"
3169,THIRD BOOK.,"From common sheep-paths, cannot help the crows"
3170,THIRD BOOK.,"From flying over,—we’re as natural still"
3171,THIRD BOOK.,As Blowsalinda. Drape us perfectly
3172,THIRD BOOK.,"In Lyons’ velvet,—we are not, for that,"
3173,THIRD BOOK.,"Lay-figures, look you! we have hearts within,"
3174,THIRD BOOK.,"Warm, live, improvident, indecent hearts,"
3175,THIRD BOOK.,As ready for distracted ends and acts
3176,THIRD BOOK.,As any distressed sempstress of them all
3177,THIRD BOOK.,That Romney groans and toils for. We catch love
3178,THIRD BOOK.,"And other fevers, in the vulgar way."
3179,THIRD BOOK.,"Love will not be outwitted by our wit,"
3180,THIRD BOOK.,Nor outrun by our equipages:—mine
3181,THIRD BOOK.,"Persisted, spite of efforts. All my cards"
3182,THIRD BOOK.,Turned up but Romney Leigh; my German stopped
3183,THIRD BOOK.,At germane Wertherism; my Paris rounds
3184,THIRD BOOK.,Returned me from the Champs Elysées just
3185,THIRD BOOK.,"A ghost, and sighing like Dido’s. I came home"
3186,THIRD BOOK.,"Uncured,—convicted rather to myself"
3187,THIRD BOOK.,Of being in love ... in love! That’s coarse you’ll say.
3188,THIRD BOOK.,I’m talking garlic.’
3189,THIRD BOOK.,Coldly I replied.
3190,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Apologise for atheism, not love!"
3191,THIRD BOOK.,"For me, I do believe in love, and God."
3192,THIRD BOOK.,I know my cousin: Lady Waldemar
3193,THIRD BOOK.,I know not: yet I say as much as this—
3194,THIRD BOOK.,"Whoever loves him, let her not excuse"
3195,THIRD BOOK.,"But cleanse herself, that, loving such a man,"
3196,THIRD BOOK.,She may not do it with such unworthy love
3197,THIRD BOOK.,He cannot stoop and take it.’
3198,THIRD BOOK.,‘That is said
3199,THIRD BOOK.,"Austerely, like a youthful prophetess,"
3200,THIRD BOOK.,Who knits her brows across her pretty eyes
3201,THIRD BOOK.,To keep them back from following the grey flight
3202,THIRD BOOK.,"Of doves between the temple-columns. Dear,"
3203,THIRD BOOK.,Be kinder with me. Let us two be friends.
3204,THIRD BOOK.,"I’m a mere woman,—the more weak perhaps"
3205,THIRD BOOK.,"Through being so proud; you’re better; as for him,"
3206,THIRD BOOK.,He’s best. Indeed he builds his goodness up
3207,THIRD BOOK.,"So high, it topples down to the other side,"
3208,THIRD BOOK.,And makes a sort of badness; there’s the worst
3209,THIRD BOOK.,I have to say against your cousin’s best!
3210,THIRD BOOK.,"And so be mild, Aurora, with my worst,"
3211,THIRD BOOK.,"For his sake, if not mine.’"
3212,THIRD BOOK.,‘I own myself
3213,THIRD BOOK.,Incredulous of confidence like this
3214,THIRD BOOK.,Availing him or you.’
3215,THIRD BOOK.,"‘I, worthy of him?"
3216,THIRD BOOK.,In your sense I am not so—let it pass.
3217,THIRD BOOK.,And yet I save him if I marry him;
3218,THIRD BOOK.,Let that pass too.’
3219,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Pass, pass! we play police"
3220,THIRD BOOK.,"Upon my cousin’s life, to indicate"
3221,THIRD BOOK.,What may or may not pass?’ I cried. ‘He knows
3222,THIRD BOOK.,What’s worthy of him; the choice remains with _him_;
3223,THIRD BOOK.,"And what he chooses, act or wife, I think"
3224,THIRD BOOK.,"I shall not call unworthy, I, for one.’"
3225,THIRD BOOK.,
3226,THIRD BOOK.,"‘’Tis somewhat rashly said,’ she answered slow."
3227,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Now let’s talk reason, though we talk of love."
3228,THIRD BOOK.,"Your cousin Romney Leigh’s a monster! there,"
3229,THIRD BOOK.,The word’s out fairly; let me prove the fact.
3230,THIRD BOOK.,"We’ll take, say, that most perfect of antiques,"
3231,THIRD BOOK.,"They call the Genius of the Vatican,"
3232,THIRD BOOK.,Which seems too beauteous to endure itself
3233,THIRD BOOK.,"In this mixed world, and fasten it for once"
3234,THIRD BOOK.,"Upon the torso of the Drunken Fawn,"
3235,THIRD BOOK.,"(Who might limp surely, if he did not dance,)"
3236,THIRD BOOK.,Instead of Buonarroti’s mask: what then?
3237,THIRD BOOK.,"We show the sort of monster Romney is,"
3238,THIRD BOOK.,With god-like virtues and heroic aims
3239,THIRD BOOK.,Subjoined to limping possibilities
3240,THIRD BOOK.,Of mismade human nature. Grant the man
3241,THIRD BOOK.,"Twice god-like, twice heroic,—still he limps,"
3242,THIRD BOOK.,And here’s the point we come to.’
3243,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Pardon me,"
3244,THIRD BOOK.,"But, Lady Waldemar, the point’s the thing"
3245,THIRD BOOK.,We never come to.’
3246,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Caustic, insolent"
3247,THIRD BOOK.,"At need! I like you’—(there, she took my hands)"
3248,THIRD BOOK.,"‘And now my lioness, help Androcles,"
3249,THIRD BOOK.,For all your roaring. Help me! for myself
3250,THIRD BOOK.,I would not say so—but for him. He limps
3251,THIRD BOOK.,"So certainly, he’ll fall into the pit"
3252,THIRD BOOK.,"A week hence,—so I lose him—so he is lost!"
3253,THIRD BOOK.,"And when he’s fairly married, he a Leigh,"
3254,THIRD BOOK.,"To a girl of doubtful life, undoubtful birth,"
3255,THIRD BOOK.,"Starved out in London, till her coarse-grained hands"
3256,THIRD BOOK.,"Are whiter than her morals,—you, for one,"
3257,THIRD BOOK.,May call his choice most worthy.’
3258,THIRD BOOK.,‘Married! lost!
3259,THIRD BOOK.,"He, ... Romney!’"
3260,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Ah, you’re moved at last,’ she said."
3261,THIRD BOOK.,"‘These monsters, set out in the open sun,"
3262,THIRD BOOK.,Of course throw monstrous shadows: those who think
3263,THIRD BOOK.,"Awry, will scarce act straightly. Who but he?"
3264,THIRD BOOK.,"And who but you can wonder? He has been mad,"
3265,THIRD BOOK.,"The whole world knows, since first, a nominal man,"
3266,THIRD BOOK.,"He soured the proctors, tried the gownsmen’s wits,"
3267,THIRD BOOK.,"With equal scorn of triangles and wine,"
3268,THIRD BOOK.,"And took no honours, yet was honourable."
3269,THIRD BOOK.,They’ll tell you he lost count of Homer’s ships
3270,THIRD BOOK.,"In Melbourne’s poor-bills, Ashley’s factory bills,—"
3271,THIRD BOOK.,"Ignored the Aspasia we all dare to praise,"
3272,THIRD BOOK.,"For other women, dear, we could not name"
3273,THIRD BOOK.,"Because we’re decent. Well, he had some right"
3274,THIRD BOOK.,"On his side probably; men always have,"
3275,THIRD BOOK.,Who go absurdly wrong. The living boor
3276,THIRD BOOK.,"Who brews your ale, exceeds in vital worth"
3277,THIRD BOOK.,Dead Cæsar who ‘stops bungholes’ in the cask;
3278,THIRD BOOK.,"And also, to do good is excellent,"
3279,THIRD BOOK.,"For persons of his income, even to boors:"
3280,THIRD BOOK.,I sympathise with all such things. But he
3281,THIRD BOOK.,"Went mad upon them ... madder and more mad,"
3282,THIRD BOOK.,"From college times to these,—as, going down hill,"
3283,THIRD BOOK.,"The faster still, the farther! you must know"
3284,THIRD BOOK.,Your Leigh by heart: he has sown his black young curls
3285,THIRD BOOK.,With bleaching cares of half a million men
3286,THIRD BOOK.,"Already. If you do not starve, or sin,"
3287,THIRD BOOK.,"You’re nothing to him. Pay the income-tax,"
3288,THIRD BOOK.,And break your heart upon’t ... he’ll scarce be touched;
3289,THIRD BOOK.,"But come upon the parish, qualified"
3290,THIRD BOOK.,"For the parish stocks, and Romney will be there"
3291,THIRD BOOK.,"To call you brother, sister, or perhaps"
3292,THIRD BOOK.,A tenderer name still. Had I any chance
3293,THIRD BOOK.,"With Mister Leigh, who am Lady Waldemar,"
3294,THIRD BOOK.,And never committed felony?’
3295,THIRD BOOK.,‘You speak
3296,THIRD BOOK.,"Too bitterly,’ I said, ‘for the literal truth.’"
3297,THIRD BOOK.,
3298,THIRD BOOK.,‘The truth is bitter. Here’s a man who looks
3299,THIRD BOOK.,For ever on the ground! you must be low
3300,THIRD BOOK.,"Or else a pictured ceiling overhead,"
3301,THIRD BOOK.,"Good painting thrown away. For me, I’ve done"
3302,THIRD BOOK.,"What women may, (we’re somewhat limited,"
3303,THIRD BOOK.,We modest women) but I’ve done my best.
3304,THIRD BOOK.,—How men are perjured when they swear our eyes
3305,THIRD BOOK.,"Have meaning in them! they’re just blue or brown,—"
3306,THIRD BOOK.,"They just can drop their lids a little. In fact,"
3307,THIRD BOOK.,"Mine did more, for I read half Fourier through,"
3308,THIRD BOOK.,"Proudhon, Considerant, and Louis Blanc,"
3309,THIRD BOOK.,With various others of his socialists;
3310,THIRD BOOK.,"And if I had been a fathom less in love,"
3311,THIRD BOOK.,"Had cured myself with gaping. As it was,"
3312,THIRD BOOK.,"I quoted from them prettily enough,"
3313,THIRD BOOK.,"Perhaps, to make them sound half rational"
3314,THIRD BOOK.,"To a saner man than he, whene’er we talked,"
3315,THIRD BOOK.,(For which I dodged occasion)—learnt by heart
3316,THIRD BOOK.,His speeches in the Commons and elsewhere
3317,THIRD BOOK.,Upon the social question; heaped reports
3318,THIRD BOOK.,"Of wicked women and penitentiaries,"
3319,THIRD BOOK.,"On all my tables, with a place for Sue;"
3320,THIRD BOOK.,And gave my name to swell subscription-lists
3321,THIRD BOOK.,"Toward keeping up the sun at nights in heaven,"
3322,THIRD BOOK.,"And other possible ends. All things I did,"
3323,THIRD BOOK.,Except the impossible ... such as wearing gowns
3324,THIRD BOOK.,"Provided by the Ten Hours’ movement! there,"
3325,THIRD BOOK.,"I stopped—we must stop somewhere. He, meanwhile,"
3326,THIRD BOOK.,"Unmoved as the Indian tortoise ’neath the world,"
3327,THIRD BOOK.,Let all that noise go on upon his back:
3328,THIRD BOOK.,He would not disconcert or throw me out;
3329,THIRD BOOK.,’Twas well to see a woman of my class
3330,THIRD BOOK.,"With such a dawn of conscience. For the heart,"
3331,THIRD BOOK.,"Made firewood for his sake, and flaming up"
3332,THIRD BOOK.,To his very face ... he warmed his feet at it;
3333,THIRD BOOK.,But deigned to let my carriage stop him short
3334,THIRD BOOK.,"In park or street,—he leaning on the door,"
3335,THIRD BOOK.,With news of the committee which sate last
3336,THIRD BOOK.,On pickpockets at suck.’
3337,THIRD BOOK.,
3338,THIRD BOOK.,‘You jest—you jest.’
3339,THIRD BOOK.,
3340,THIRD BOOK.,"‘As martyrs jest, dear, (if you’ve read their lives)"
3341,THIRD BOOK.,Upon the axe which kills them. When all’s done
3342,THIRD BOOK.,"By me, ... for him—you’ll ask him presently"
3343,THIRD BOOK.,"The colour of my hair—he cannot tell,"
3344,THIRD BOOK.,"Or answers ‘dark’ at random,—while, be sure,"
3345,THIRD BOOK.,"He’s absolute on the figure, five or ten,"
3346,THIRD BOOK.,"Of my last subscription. Is it bearable,"
3347,THIRD BOOK.,And I a woman?’
3348,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Is it reparable,"
3349,THIRD BOOK.,Though _I_ were a man?’
3350,THIRD BOOK.,‘I know not. That’s to prove.
3351,THIRD BOOK.,"But, first, this shameful marriage.’"
3352,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Ay?’ I cried,"
3353,THIRD BOOK.,‘Then really there’s a marriage?’
3354,THIRD BOOK.,‘Yesterday
3355,THIRD BOOK.,"I held him fast upon it. ‘Mister Leigh,’"
3356,THIRD BOOK.,"Said I, ‘shut up a thing, it makes more noise."
3357,THIRD BOOK.,The boiling town keeps secrets ill; I’ve known
3358,THIRD BOOK.,Yours since last week. Forgive my knowledge so:
3359,THIRD BOOK.,You feel I’m not the woman of the world
3360,THIRD BOOK.,"The world thinks; you have borne with me before,"
3361,THIRD BOOK.,"And used me in your noble work, our work,"
3362,THIRD BOOK.,And now you shall not cast me off because
3363,THIRD BOOK.,"You’re at the difficult point, the _join_. ’Tis true"
3364,THIRD BOOK.,Even I can scarce admit the cogency
3365,THIRD BOOK.,"Of such a marriage ... where you do not love,"
3366,THIRD BOOK.,(Except the class) yet marry and throw your name
3367,THIRD BOOK.,"Down to the gutter, for a fire-escape"
3368,THIRD BOOK.,"To future generations! it’s sublime,"
3369,THIRD BOOK.,"A great example,—a true Genesis"
3370,THIRD BOOK.,Of the opening social era. But take heed;
3371,THIRD BOOK.,"This virtuous act must have a patent weight,"
3372,THIRD BOOK.,"Or loses half its virtue. Make it tell,"
3373,THIRD BOOK.,"Interpret it, and set in the light,"
3374,THIRD BOOK.,And do not muffle it in a winter-cloak
3375,THIRD BOOK.,"As a vulgar bit of shame,—as if, at best,"
3376,THIRD BOOK.,A Leigh had made a misalliance and blushed
3377,THIRD BOOK.,"A Howard should know it.’ Then, I pressed him more—"
3378,THIRD BOOK.,"‘He would not choose,’ I said, ‘that even his kin, ..."
3379,THIRD BOOK.,"Aurora Leigh, even ... should conceive his act"
3380,THIRD BOOK.,"Less sacrifice, more appetite.’ At which"
3381,THIRD BOOK.,"He grew so pale, dear, ... to the lips, I knew"
3382,THIRD BOOK.,"I had touched him. ‘Do you know her,’ he enquired,"
3383,THIRD BOOK.,"‘My cousin Aurora?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, and lied,"
3384,THIRD BOOK.,(But truly we all know you by your books)
3385,THIRD BOOK.,"And so I offered to come straight to you,"
3386,THIRD BOOK.,"Explain the subject, justify the cause,"
3387,THIRD BOOK.,And take you with me to St. Margaret’s Court
3388,THIRD BOOK.,"To see this miracle, this Marian Erle,"
3389,THIRD BOOK.,"This drover’s daughter (she’s not pretty, he swears)"
3390,THIRD BOOK.,"Upon whose finger, exquisitely pricked"
3391,THIRD BOOK.,"By a hundred needles, we’re to hang the tie"
3392,THIRD BOOK.,"’Twixt class and class in England,—thus, indeed,"
3393,THIRD BOOK.,"By such a presence, yours and mine, to lift"
3394,THIRD BOOK.,The match up from the doubtful place. At once
3395,THIRD BOOK.,"He thanked me, sighing ... murmured to himself,"
3396,THIRD BOOK.,"‘She’ll do it perhaps; she’s noble,’—thanked me twice,"
3397,THIRD BOOK.,"And promised, as my guerdon, to put off"
3398,THIRD BOOK.,His marriage for a month.’
3399,THIRD BOOK.,I answered then.
3400,THIRD BOOK.,‘I understand your drift imperfectly.
3401,THIRD BOOK.,"You wish to lead me to my cousin’s betrothed,"
3402,THIRD BOOK.,"To touch her hand if worthy, and hold her hand"
3403,THIRD BOOK.,"If feeble, thus to justify his match."
3404,THIRD BOOK.,"So be it then. But how this serves your ends,"
3405,THIRD BOOK.,And how the strange confession of your love
3406,THIRD BOOK.,"Serves this, I have to learn—I cannot see.’"
3407,THIRD BOOK.,
3408,THIRD BOOK.,"She knit her restless forehead. ‘Then, despite,"
3409,THIRD BOOK.,"Aurora, that most radiant morning name,"
3410,THIRD BOOK.,You’re dull as any London afternoon.
3411,THIRD BOOK.,"I wanted time,—and gained it,—wanted _you_,"
3412,THIRD BOOK.,"And gain you! You will come and see the girl,"
3413,THIRD BOOK.,"In whose most prodigal eyes, the lineal pearl"
3414,THIRD BOOK.,And pride of all your lofty race of Leighs
3415,THIRD BOOK.,Is destined to solution. Authorised
3416,THIRD BOOK.,"By sight and knowledge, then, you’ll speak your mind,"
3417,THIRD BOOK.,"And prove to Romney, in your brilliant way,"
3418,THIRD BOOK.,He’ll wrong the people and posterity
3419,THIRD BOOK.,"(Say such a thing is bad for you and me,"
3420,THIRD BOOK.,"And you fail utterly,) by concluding thus"
3421,THIRD BOOK.,"An execrable marriage. Break it up,"
3422,THIRD BOOK.,"Disroot it—peradventure, presently,"
3423,THIRD BOOK.,We’ll plant a better fortune in its place.
3424,THIRD BOOK.,"Be good to me, Aurora, scorn me less"
3425,THIRD BOOK.,For saying the thing I should not. Well I know
3426,THIRD BOOK.,"I should not. I have kept, as others have,"
3427,THIRD BOOK.,The iron rule of womanly reserve
3428,THIRD BOOK.,"In lip and life, till now: I wept a week"
3429,THIRD BOOK.,"Before I came here.’—Ending, she was pale;"
3430,THIRD BOOK.,"The last words, haughtily said, were tremulous."
3431,THIRD BOOK.,"This palfrey pranced in harness, arched her neck,"
3432,THIRD BOOK.,"And, only by the foam upon the bit,"
3433,THIRD BOOK.,You saw she champed against it.
3434,THIRD BOOK.,Then I rose.
3435,THIRD BOOK.,‘I love love! truth’s no cleaner thing than love.
3436,THIRD BOOK.,I comprehend a love so fiery hot
3437,THIRD BOOK.,"It burns its natural veil of august shame,"
3438,THIRD BOOK.,"And stands sublimely in the nude, as chaste"
3439,THIRD BOOK.,"As Medicean Venus. But I know,"
3440,THIRD BOOK.,"A love that burns through veils, will burn through masks,"
3441,THIRD BOOK.,"And shrivel up treachery. What, love and lie!"
3442,THIRD BOOK.,Nay—go to the opera! your love’s curable.’
3443,THIRD BOOK.,
3444,THIRD BOOK.,"‘I love and lie?’ she said—‘I lie, forsooth?’"
3445,THIRD BOOK.,"And beat her taper foot upon the floor,"
3446,THIRD BOOK.,"And smiled against the shoe,—‘You’re hard, Miss Leigh,"
3447,THIRD BOOK.,Unversed in current phrases.—Bowling-greens
3448,THIRD BOOK.,Of poets are fresher than the world’s highways;
3449,THIRD BOOK.,Forgive me that I rashly blew the dust
3450,THIRD BOOK.,"Which dims our hedges even, in your eyes,"
3451,THIRD BOOK.,"And vexed you so much. You find, probably,"
3452,THIRD BOOK.,"No evil in this marriage,—rather good"
3453,THIRD BOOK.,"Of innocence, to pastoralise in song:"
3454,THIRD BOOK.,"You’ll give the bond your signature, perhaps,"
3455,THIRD BOOK.,"Beneath the lady’s mark,—indifferent"
3456,THIRD BOOK.,"That Romney chose a wife, could write her name,"
3457,THIRD BOOK.,In witnessing he loved her.’
3458,THIRD BOOK.,‘Loved!’ I cried;
3459,THIRD BOOK.,‘Who tells you that he wants a wife to love?
3460,THIRD BOOK.,"He gets a horse to use, not love, I think:"
3461,THIRD BOOK.,"There’s work for wives as well,—and after, straw,"
3462,THIRD BOOK.,"When men are liberal. For myself, you err"
3463,THIRD BOOK.,Supposing power in me to break this match.
3464,THIRD BOOK.,"I could not do it, to save Romney’s life;"
3465,THIRD BOOK.,"And would not, to save mine.’"
3466,THIRD BOOK.,"‘You take it so,’"
3467,THIRD BOOK.,"She said; ‘farewell then. Write your books in peace,"
3468,THIRD BOOK.,As far as may be for some secret stir
3469,THIRD BOOK.,"Now obvious to me,—for, most obviously,"
3470,THIRD BOOK.,In coming hither I mistook the way.’
3471,THIRD BOOK.,"Whereat she touched my hand, and bent her head,"
3472,THIRD BOOK.,And floated from me like a silent cloud
3473,THIRD BOOK.,That leaves the sense of thunder.
3474,THIRD BOOK.,I drew breath
3475,THIRD BOOK.,As hard as in a sick room. After all
3476,THIRD BOOK.,This woman breaks her social system up
3477,THIRD BOOK.,"For love, so counted—the love possible"
3478,THIRD BOOK.,"To such,—and lilies are still lilies, pulled"
3479,THIRD BOOK.,"By smutty hands, though spotted from their white;"
3480,THIRD BOOK.,"And thus she is better, haply, of her kind,"
3481,THIRD BOOK.,"Than Romney Leigh, who lives by diagrams,"
3482,THIRD BOOK.,And crosses out the spontaneities
3483,THIRD BOOK.,"Of all his individual, personal life,"
3484,THIRD BOOK.,With formal universals. As if man
3485,THIRD BOOK.,"Were set upon a high stool at a desk,"
3486,THIRD BOOK.,"To keep God’s books for Him, in red and black,"
3487,THIRD BOOK.,"And feel by millions! What, if even God"
3488,THIRD BOOK.,Were chiefly God by living out Himself
3489,THIRD BOOK.,"To an individualism of the Infinite,"
3490,THIRD BOOK.,"Eterne, intense, profuse,—still throwing up"
3491,THIRD BOOK.,The golden spray of multitudinous worlds
3492,THIRD BOOK.,In measure to the proclive weight and rush
3493,THIRD BOOK.,"Of His inner nature,—the spontaneous love"
3494,THIRD BOOK.,Still proof and outflow of spontaneous life?
3495,THIRD BOOK.,"Then live, Aurora!"
3496,THIRD BOOK.,"Two hours afterward,"
3497,THIRD BOOK.,"Within St. Margaret’s Court I stood alone,"
3498,THIRD BOOK.,"Close-veiled. A sick child, from an ague-fit,"
3499,THIRD BOOK.,Whose wasted right hand gambled ’gainst his left
3500,THIRD BOOK.,"With an old brass button, in a blot of sun,"
3501,THIRD BOOK.,Jeered weakly at me as I passed across
3502,THIRD BOOK.,"The uneven pavement; while a woman, rouged"
3503,THIRD BOOK.,"Upon the angular cheek-bones, kerchief torn,"
3504,THIRD BOOK.,"Thin dangling locks, and flat lascivious mouth,"
3505,THIRD BOOK.,"Cursed at a window, both ways, in and out,"
3506,THIRD BOOK.,"By turns some bed-rid creature and myself,—"
3507,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Lie still there, mother! liker the dead dog"
3508,THIRD BOOK.,"You’ll be to-morrow. What, we pick our way,"
3509,THIRD BOOK.,"Fine madam, with those damnable small feet!"
3510,THIRD BOOK.,"We cover up our face from doing good,"
3511,THIRD BOOK.,"As if it were our purse! What brings you here,"
3512,THIRD BOOK.,My lady? is’t to find my gentleman
3513,THIRD BOOK.,Who visits his tame pigeon in the eaves?
3514,THIRD BOOK.,"Our cholera catch you with its cramps and spasms,"
3515,THIRD BOOK.,"And tumble up your good clothes, veil and all,"
3516,THIRD BOOK.,And turn your whiteness dead-blue.’ I looked up;
3517,THIRD BOOK.,"I think I could have walked through hell that day,"
3518,THIRD BOOK.,"And never flinched. ‘The dear Christ comfort you,’"
3519,THIRD BOOK.,"I said, ‘you must have been most miserable"
3520,THIRD BOOK.,"To be so cruel,’—and I emptied out"
3521,THIRD BOOK.,"My purse upon the stones: when, as I had cast"
3522,THIRD BOOK.,"The last charm in the cauldron, the whole court"
3523,THIRD BOOK.,"Went boiling, bubbling up, from all its doors"
3524,THIRD BOOK.,"And windows, with a hideous wail of laughs"
3525,THIRD BOOK.,"And roar of oaths, and blows perhaps ... I passed"
3526,THIRD BOOK.,Too quickly for distinguishing ... and pushed
3527,THIRD BOOK.,"A little side-door hanging on a hinge,"
3528,THIRD BOOK.,"And plunged into the dark, and groped and climbed"
3529,THIRD BOOK.,"The long, steep, narrow stair ’twixt broken rail"
3530,THIRD BOOK.,And mildewed wall that let the plaster drop
3531,THIRD BOOK.,"To startle me in the blackness. Still, up, up!"
3532,THIRD BOOK.,So high lived Romney’s bride. I paused at last
3533,THIRD BOOK.,"Before a low door in the roof, and knocked;"
3534,THIRD BOOK.,There came an answer like a hurried dove—
3535,THIRD BOOK.,‘So soon? can that be Mister Leigh? so soon?’
3536,THIRD BOOK.,"And as I entered, an ineffable face"
3537,THIRD BOOK.,"Met mine upon the threshold. ‘Oh, not you,"
3538,THIRD BOOK.,"Not you!’ ... the dropping of the voice implied,"
3539,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Then, if not you, for me not any one.’"
3540,THIRD BOOK.,"I looked her in the eyes, and held her hands,"
3541,THIRD BOOK.,"And said, ‘I am his cousin,—Romney Leigh’s;"
3542,THIRD BOOK.,And here I’m come to see my cousin too.’
3543,THIRD BOOK.,"She touched me with her face and with her voice,"
3544,THIRD BOOK.,"This daughter of the people. Such soft flowers,"
3545,THIRD BOOK.,"From such rough roots? the people, under there,"
3546,THIRD BOOK.,"Can sin so, curse so, look so, smell so ... faugh!"
3547,THIRD BOOK.,Yet have such daughters?
3548,THIRD BOOK.,No wise beautiful
3549,THIRD BOOK.,"Was Marian Erle. She was not white nor brown,"
3550,THIRD BOOK.,"But could look either, like a mist that changed"
3551,THIRD BOOK.,According to being shone on more or less.
3552,THIRD BOOK.,"The hair, too, ran its opulence of curls"
3553,THIRD BOOK.,"In doubt ’twixt dark and bright, nor left you clear"
3554,THIRD BOOK.,To name the colour. Too much hair perhaps
3555,THIRD BOOK.,"(I’ll name a fault here) for so small a head,"
3556,THIRD BOOK.,"Which seemed to droop on that side and on this,"
3557,THIRD BOOK.,"As a full-blown rose uneasy with its weight,"
3558,THIRD BOOK.,"Though not a breath should trouble it. Again,"
3559,THIRD BOOK.,The dimple in the cheek had better gone
3560,THIRD BOOK.,"With redder, fuller rounds: and somewhat large"
3561,THIRD BOOK.,"The mouth was, though the milky little teeth"
3562,THIRD BOOK.,Dissolved it to so infantine a smile!
3563,THIRD BOOK.,"For soon it smiled at me; the eyes smiled too,"
3564,THIRD BOOK.,"But ’twas as if remembering they had wept,"
3565,THIRD BOOK.,"And knowing they should, some day, weep again."
3566,THIRD BOOK.,
3567,THIRD BOOK.,"We talked. She told me all her story out,"
3568,THIRD BOOK.,"Which I’ll re-tell with fuller utterance,"
3569,THIRD BOOK.,As coloured and confirmed in aftertimes
3570,THIRD BOOK.,"By others, and herself too. Marian Erle"
3571,THIRD BOOK.,Was born upon the ledge of Malvern Hill
3572,THIRD BOOK.,"To eastward, in a hut, built up at night"
3573,THIRD BOOK.,"To evade the landlord’s eye, of mud and turf,"
3574,THIRD BOOK.,"Still liable, if once he looked that way,"
3575,THIRD BOOK.,"To being straight levelled, scattered by his foot,"
3576,THIRD BOOK.,"Like any other anthill. Born, I say;"
3577,THIRD BOOK.,"God sent her to his world, commissioned right,"
3578,THIRD BOOK.,"Her human testimonials fully signed,"
3579,THIRD BOOK.,Not scant in soul—complete in lineaments;
3580,THIRD BOOK.,But others had to swindle her a place
3581,THIRD BOOK.,"To wail in when she had come. No place for her,"
3582,THIRD BOOK.,"By man’s law! born an outlaw, was this babe."
3583,THIRD BOOK.,"Her first cry in our strange and strangling air,"
3584,THIRD BOOK.,"When cast in spasms out by the shuddering womb,"
3585,THIRD BOOK.,"Was wrong against the social code,—forced wrong."
3586,THIRD BOOK.,What business had the baby to cry there?
3587,THIRD BOOK.,
3588,THIRD BOOK.,I tell her story and grow passionate.
3589,THIRD BOOK.,"She, Marian, did not tell it so, but used"
3590,THIRD BOOK.,Meek words that made no wonder of herself
3591,THIRD BOOK.,For being so sad a creature. ‘Mister Leigh
3592,THIRD BOOK.,Considered truly that such things should change.
3593,THIRD BOOK.,"They _will_, in heaven—but meantime, on the earth,"
3594,THIRD BOOK.,"There’s none can like a nettle as a pink,"
3595,THIRD BOOK.,"Except himself. We’re nettles, some of us,"
3596,THIRD BOOK.,And give offence by the act of springing up;
3597,THIRD BOOK.,"And, if we leave the damp side of the wall,"
3598,THIRD BOOK.,"The hoes, of course, are on us.’ So she said."
3599,THIRD BOOK.,Her father earned his life by random jobs
3600,THIRD BOOK.,Despised by steadier workmen—keeping swine
3601,THIRD BOOK.,"On commons, picking hops, or hurrying on"
3602,THIRD BOOK.,"The harvest at wet seasons,—or, at need,"
3603,THIRD BOOK.,"Assisting the Welsh drovers, when a drove"
3604,THIRD BOOK.,Of startled horses plunged into the mist
3605,THIRD BOOK.,"Below the mountain-road, and sowed the wind"
3606,THIRD BOOK.,With wandering neighings. In between the gaps
3607,THIRD BOOK.,"Of such irregular work, he drank and slept,"
3608,THIRD BOOK.,"And cursed his wife because, the pence being out,"
3609,THIRD BOOK.,"She could not buy more drink. At which she turned,"
3610,THIRD BOOK.,(The worm) and beat her baby in revenge
3611,THIRD BOOK.,For her own broken heart. There’s not a crime
3612,THIRD BOOK.,"But takes its proper change out still in crime,"
3613,THIRD BOOK.,If once rung on the counter of this world;
3614,THIRD BOOK.,Let sinners look to it.
3615,THIRD BOOK.,"Yet the outcast child,"
3616,THIRD BOOK.,For whom the very mother’s face forewent
3617,THIRD BOOK.,"The mother’s special patience, lived and grew;"
3618,THIRD BOOK.,"Learnt early to cry low, and walk alone,"
3619,THIRD BOOK.,With that pathetic vacillating roll
3620,THIRD BOOK.,"Of the infant body on the uncertain feet,"
3621,THIRD BOOK.,(The earth being felt unstable ground so soon)
3622,THIRD BOOK.,At which most women’s arms unclose at once
3623,THIRD BOOK.,"With irrepressive instinct. Thus, at three,"
3624,THIRD BOOK.,"This poor weaned kid would run off from the fold,"
3625,THIRD BOOK.,"This babe would steal off from the mother’s chair,"
3626,THIRD BOOK.,"And, creeping through the golden walls of gorse,"
3627,THIRD BOOK.,Would find some keyhole toward the secresy
3628,THIRD BOOK.,"Of Heaven’s high blue, and, nestling down, peer out—"
3629,THIRD BOOK.,"Oh, not to catch the angels at their games,"
3630,THIRD BOOK.,"She had never heard of angels,—but to gaze"
3631,THIRD BOOK.,"She knew not why, to see she knew not what,"
3632,THIRD BOOK.,A-hungering outward from the barren earth
3633,THIRD BOOK.,"For something like a joy. She liked, she said,"
3634,THIRD BOOK.,"To dazzle black her sight against the sky,"
3635,THIRD BOOK.,"For then, it seemed, some grand blind Love came down,"
3636,THIRD BOOK.,"And groped her out, and clasped her with a kiss;"
3637,THIRD BOOK.,"She learnt God that way, and was beat for it"
3638,THIRD BOOK.,"Whenever she went home,—yet came again,"
3639,THIRD BOOK.,"As surely as the trapped hare, getting free,"
3640,THIRD BOOK.,"Returns to his form. This grand blind Love, she said,"
3641,THIRD BOOK.,"This skyey father and mother both in one,"
3642,THIRD BOOK.,Instructed her and civilised her more
3643,THIRD BOOK.,"Than even the Sunday-school did afterward,"
3644,THIRD BOOK.,To which a lady sent her to learn books
3645,THIRD BOOK.,And sit upon a long bench in a row
3646,THIRD BOOK.,"With other children. Well, she laughed sometimes"
3647,THIRD BOOK.,"To see them laugh and laugh, and moil their texts;"
3648,THIRD BOOK.,"But ofter she was sorrowful with noise,"
3649,THIRD BOOK.,"And wondered if their mothers beat them hard,"
3650,THIRD BOOK.,That ever they should laugh so. There was one
3651,THIRD BOOK.,"She loved indeed,—Rose Bell, a seven years’ child,"
3652,THIRD BOOK.,"So pretty and clever, who read syllables"
3653,THIRD BOOK.,When Marian was at letters; _she_ would laugh
3654,THIRD BOOK.,"At nothing—hold your finger up, she laughed,"
3655,THIRD BOOK.,Then shook her curls down on her eyes and mouth
3656,THIRD BOOK.,To hide her make-mirth from the schoolmaster.
3657,THIRD BOOK.,"And Rose’s pelting glee, as frank as rain"
3658,THIRD BOOK.,"On cherry-blossoms, brightened Marian too,"
3659,THIRD BOOK.,To see another merry whom she loved.
3660,THIRD BOOK.,"She whispered once (the children side by side,"
3661,THIRD BOOK.,With mutual arms entwined about their necks)
3662,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Your mother lets you laugh so?’ ‘Ay,’ said Rose,"
3663,THIRD BOOK.,‘She lets me. She was dug into the ground
3664,THIRD BOOK.,"Six years since, I being but a yearling wean."
3665,THIRD BOOK.,"Such mothers let us play and lose our time,"
3666,THIRD BOOK.,And never scold nor beat us! don’t you wish
3667,THIRD BOOK.,"You had one like that?’ There, Marian breaking off"
3668,THIRD BOOK.,"Looked suddenly in my face. ‘Poor Rose,’ said she,"
3669,THIRD BOOK.,‘I heard her laugh last night in Oxford Street.
3670,THIRD BOOK.,"I’d pour out half my blood to stop that laugh,—"
3671,THIRD BOOK.,"Poor Rose, poor Rose!’ said Marian."
3672,THIRD BOOK.,She resumed.
3673,THIRD BOOK.,"It tried her, when she had learnt at Sunday-school"
3674,THIRD BOOK.,"What God was, what he wanted from us all,"
3675,THIRD BOOK.,"And how, in choosing sin, we vexed the Christ,"
3676,THIRD BOOK.,To go straight home and hear her father pull
3677,THIRD BOOK.,"The Name down on us from the thunder-shelf,"
3678,THIRD BOOK.,Then drink away his soul into the dark
3679,THIRD BOOK.,"From seeing judgment. Father, mother, home,"
3680,THIRD BOOK.,Were God and heaven reversed to her: the more
3681,THIRD BOOK.,"She knew of Right, the more she guessed their wrong;"
3682,THIRD BOOK.,"Her price paid down for knowledge, was to know"
3683,THIRD BOOK.,"The vileness of her kindred: through her heart,"
3684,THIRD BOOK.,"Her filial and tormented heart, henceforth,"
3685,THIRD BOOK.,"They struck their blows at virtue. Oh, ’tis hard"
3686,THIRD BOOK.,To learn you have a father up in heaven
3687,THIRD BOOK.,"By a gathering certain sense of being, on earth,"
3688,THIRD BOOK.,"Still worse than orphaned: ’tis too heavy a grief,"
3689,THIRD BOOK.,The having to thank God for such a joy!
3690,THIRD BOOK.,
3691,THIRD BOOK.,And so passed Marian’s life from year to year.
3692,THIRD BOOK.,"Her parents took her with them when they tramped,"
3693,THIRD BOOK.,"Dodged lanes and heaths, frequented towns and fairs,"
3694,THIRD BOOK.,"And once went farther and saw Manchester,"
3695,THIRD BOOK.,"And once the sea, that blue end of the world,"
3696,THIRD BOOK.,"That fair scroll-finis of a wicked book,—"
3697,THIRD BOOK.,"And twice a prison,—back at intervals,"
3698,THIRD BOOK.,"Returning to the hills. Hills draw like heaven,"
3699,THIRD BOOK.,"And stronger sometimes, holding out their hands"
3700,THIRD BOOK.,To pull you from the vile flats up to them;
3701,THIRD BOOK.,"And though, perhaps, these strollers still strolled back,"
3702,THIRD BOOK.,"As sheep do, simply that they knew the way,"
3703,THIRD BOOK.,They certainly felt bettered unawares
3704,THIRD BOOK.,Emerging from the social smut of towns
3705,THIRD BOOK.,To wipe their feet clean on the mountain-turf.
3706,THIRD BOOK.,"In which long wanderings, Marian lived and learned,"
3707,THIRD BOOK.,Endured and learned. The people on the roads
3708,THIRD BOOK.,Would stop and ask her how her eyes outgrew
3709,THIRD BOOK.,"Her cheeks, and if she meant to lodge the birds"
3710,THIRD BOOK.,"In all that hair; and then they lifted her,"
3711,THIRD BOOK.,"The miller in his cart, a mile or twain,"
3712,THIRD BOOK.,"The butcher’s boy on horseback. Often, too,"
3713,THIRD BOOK.,"The pedlar stopped, and tapped her on the head"
3714,THIRD BOOK.,"With absolute forefinger, brown and ringed,"
3715,THIRD BOOK.,And asked if peradventure she could read;
3716,THIRD BOOK.,"And when she answered ‘ay,’ would toss her down"
3717,THIRD BOOK.,"Some stray odd volume from his heavy pack,"
3718,THIRD BOOK.,"A Thomson’s Seasons, mulcted of the Spring,"
3719,THIRD BOOK.,"Or half a play of Shakspeare’s, torn across:"
3720,THIRD BOOK.,(She had to guess the bottom of a page
3721,THIRD BOOK.,"By just the top sometimes,—as difficult,"
3722,THIRD BOOK.,"As, sitting on the moon, to guess the earth!)"
3723,THIRD BOOK.,Or else a sheaf of leaves (for that small Ruth’s
3724,THIRD BOOK.,"Small gleanings) torn out from the heart of books,"
3725,THIRD BOOK.,"From Churchyard Elegies and Edens Lost,"
3726,THIRD BOOK.,"From Burns, and Bunyan, Selkirk, and Tom Jones."
3727,THIRD BOOK.,"’Twas somewhat hard to keep the things distinct,"
3728,THIRD BOOK.,And oft the jangling influence jarred the child
3729,THIRD BOOK.,Like looking at a sunset full of grace
3730,THIRD BOOK.,Through a pothouse window while the drunken oaths
3731,THIRD BOOK.,Went on behind her; but she weeded out
3732,THIRD BOOK.,"Her book-leaves, threw away the leaves that hurt,"
3733,THIRD BOOK.,"(First tore them small, that none should find a word)"
3734,THIRD BOOK.,And made a nosegay of the sweet and good
3735,THIRD BOOK.,"To fold within her breast, and pore upon"
3736,THIRD BOOK.,"At broken moments of the noontide glare,"
3737,THIRD BOOK.,When leave was given her to untie her cloak
3738,THIRD BOOK.,And rest upon the dusty roadside bank
3739,THIRD BOOK.,"From the highway’s dust. Or oft, the journey done,"
3740,THIRD BOOK.,Some city friend would lead her by the hand
3741,THIRD BOOK.,To hear a lecture at an institute:
3742,THIRD BOOK.,"And thus she had grown, this Marian Erle of ours,"
3743,THIRD BOOK.,"To no book-learning,—she was ignorant"
3744,THIRD BOOK.,"Of authors,—not in earshot of the things"
3745,THIRD BOOK.,"Out-spoken o’er the heads of common men,"
3746,THIRD BOOK.,"By men who are uncommon,—but within"
3747,THIRD BOOK.,"The cadenced hum of such, and capable"
3748,THIRD BOOK.,Of catching from the fringes of the wind
3749,THIRD BOOK.,"Some fragmentary phrases, here and there,"
3750,THIRD BOOK.,"Of that fine music,—which, being carried in"
3751,THIRD BOOK.,"To her soul, had reproduced itself afresh"
3752,THIRD BOOK.,In finer motions of the lips and lids.
3753,THIRD BOOK.,
3754,THIRD BOOK.,"She said, in speaking of it, ‘If a flower"
3755,THIRD BOOK.,"Were thrown you out of heaven at intervals,"
3756,THIRD BOOK.,"You’d soon attain to a trick of looking up,—"
3757,THIRD BOOK.,"And so with her.’ She counted me her years,"
3758,THIRD BOOK.,Till _I_ felt old; and then she counted me
3759,THIRD BOOK.,"Her sorrowful pleasures, till I felt ashamed."
3760,THIRD BOOK.,She told me she was almost glad and calm
3761,THIRD BOOK.,"On such and such a season; sate and sewed,"
3762,THIRD BOOK.,With no one to break up her crystal thoughts;
3763,THIRD BOOK.,While rhymes from lovely poems span around
3764,THIRD BOOK.,"Their ringing circles of ecstatic tune,"
3765,THIRD BOOK.,Beneath the moistened finger of the Hour.
3766,THIRD BOOK.,"Her parents called her a strange, sickly child,"
3767,THIRD BOOK.,"Not good for much, and given to sulk and stare,"
3768,THIRD BOOK.,"And smile into the hedges and the clouds,"
3769,THIRD BOOK.,And tremble if one shook her from her fit
3770,THIRD BOOK.,"By any blow, or word even. Out-door jobs"
3771,THIRD BOOK.,"Went ill with her; and household quiet work,"
3772,THIRD BOOK.,"She was not born to. Had they kept the north,"
3773,THIRD BOOK.,"They might have had their pennyworth out of her,"
3774,THIRD BOOK.,"Like other parents, in the factories;"
3775,THIRD BOOK.,"(Your children work for you, not you for them,"
3776,THIRD BOOK.,Or else they better had been choked with air
3777,THIRD BOOK.,"The first breath drawn;) but, in this tramping life,"
3778,THIRD BOOK.,"Was nothing to be done with such a child,"
3779,THIRD BOOK.,But tramp and tramp. And yet she knitted hose
3780,THIRD BOOK.,"Not ill, and was not dull at needlework;"
3781,THIRD BOOK.,And all the country people gave her pence
3782,THIRD BOOK.,"For darning stockings past their natural age,"
3783,THIRD BOOK.,"And patching petticoats from old to new,"
3784,THIRD BOOK.,And other light work done for thrifty wives.
3785,THIRD BOOK.,
3786,THIRD BOOK.,"One day, said Marian,—the sun shone that day—"
3787,THIRD BOOK.,"Her mother had been badly beat, and felt"
3788,THIRD BOOK.,"The bruises sore about her wretched soul,"
3789,THIRD BOOK.,"(That must have been): she came in suddenly,"
3790,THIRD BOOK.,"And snatching, in a sort of breathless rage,"
3791,THIRD BOOK.,"Her daughter’s headgear comb, let down the hair"
3792,THIRD BOOK.,"Upon her, like a sudden waterfall,"
3793,THIRD BOOK.,"And drew her drenched and passive, by the arm,"
3794,THIRD BOOK.,Outside the hut they lived in. When the child
3795,THIRD BOOK.,Could clear her blinded face from all that stream
3796,THIRD BOOK.,"Of tresses ... there, a man stood, with beast’s eyes,"
3797,THIRD BOOK.,"That seemed as they would swallow her alive,"
3798,THIRD BOOK.,"Complete in body and spirit, hair and all,—"
3799,THIRD BOOK.,"With burning stertorous breath that hurt her cheek,"
3800,THIRD BOOK.,"He breathed so near. The mother held her tight,"
3801,THIRD BOOK.,"Saying hard between her teeth—‘Why wench, why wench,"
3802,THIRD BOOK.,The squire speaks to you now—the squire’s too good;
3803,THIRD BOOK.,"He means to set you up, and comfort us."
3804,THIRD BOOK.,"Be mannerly at least.’ The child turned round,"
3805,THIRD BOOK.,"And looked up piteous in the mother’s face,"
3806,THIRD BOOK.,(Be sure that mother’s death-bed will not want
3807,THIRD BOOK.,"Another devil to damn, than such a look) ..."
3808,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Oh, mother!’ then, with desperate glance to heaven,"
3809,THIRD BOOK.,"‘God, free me from my mother,’ she shrieked out,"
3810,THIRD BOOK.,"‘These mothers are too dreadful.’ And, with force"
3811,THIRD BOOK.,"As passionate as fear, she tore her hands"
3812,THIRD BOOK.,"Like lilies from the rocks, from hers and his,"
3813,THIRD BOOK.,"And sprang down, bounded headlong down the steep,"
3814,THIRD BOOK.,"Away from both—away, if possible,"
3815,THIRD BOOK.,"As far as God,—away! They yelled at her,"
3816,THIRD BOOK.,"As famished hounds at a hare. She heard them yell,"
3817,THIRD BOOK.,"She felt her name hiss after her from the hills,"
3818,THIRD BOOK.,"Like shot from guns. On, on. And now she had cast"
3819,THIRD BOOK.,The voices off with the uplands. On. Mad fear
3820,THIRD BOOK.,Was running in her feet and killing the ground;
3821,THIRD BOOK.,"The white roads curled as if she burnt them up,"
3822,THIRD BOOK.,"The green fields melted, wayside trees fell back"
3823,THIRD BOOK.,"To make room for her. Then, her head grew vexed,"
3824,THIRD BOOK.,"Trees, fields, turned on her, and ran after her;"
3825,THIRD BOOK.,"She heard the quick pants of the hills behind,"
3826,THIRD BOOK.,"Their keen air pricked her neck. She had lost her feet,"
3827,THIRD BOOK.,"Could run no more, yet, somehow, went as fast,—"
3828,THIRD BOOK.,"The horizon, red ’twixt steeples in the east,"
3829,THIRD BOOK.,"So sucked her forward, forward, while her heart"
3830,THIRD BOOK.,"Kept swelling, swelling, till it swelled so big"
3831,THIRD BOOK.,"It seemed to fill her body; then it burst,"
3832,THIRD BOOK.,"And overflowed the world and swamped the light,"
3833,THIRD BOOK.,"‘And now I am dead and safe,’ thought Marian Erle—"
3834,THIRD BOOK.,"She had dropped, she had fainted."
3835,THIRD BOOK.,"When the sense returned,"
3836,THIRD BOOK.,The night had passed—not life’s night. She was ’ware
3837,THIRD BOOK.,"Of heavy tumbling motions, creaking wheels,"
3838,THIRD BOOK.,The driver shouting to the lazy team
3839,THIRD BOOK.,That swung their rankling bells against her brain;
3840,THIRD BOOK.,"While, through the waggon’s coverture and chinks,"
3841,THIRD BOOK.,The cruel yellow morning pecked at her
3842,THIRD BOOK.,"Alive or dead, upon the straw inside,—"
3843,THIRD BOOK.,At which her soul ached back into the dark
3844,THIRD BOOK.,"And prayed, ‘no more of that.’ A waggoner"
3845,THIRD BOOK.,"Had found her in a ditch beneath the moon,"
3846,THIRD BOOK.,"As white as moonshine, save for the oozing blood."
3847,THIRD BOOK.,At first he thought her dead; but when he had wiped
3848,THIRD BOOK.,"The mouth and heard it sigh, he raised her up,"
3849,THIRD BOOK.,"And laid her in his waggon in the straw,"
3850,THIRD BOOK.,And so conveyed her to the distant town
3851,THIRD BOOK.,"To which his business called himself, and left"
3852,THIRD BOOK.,That heap of misery at the hospital.
3853,THIRD BOOK.,
3854,THIRD BOOK.,She stirred;—the place seemed new and strange as death.
3855,THIRD BOOK.,"The white strait bed, with others strait and white,"
3856,THIRD BOOK.,"Like graves dug side by side, at measured lengths,"
3857,THIRD BOOK.,And quiet people walking in and out
3858,THIRD BOOK.,"With wonderful low voices and soft steps,"
3859,THIRD BOOK.,"And apparitional equal care for each,"
3860,THIRD BOOK.,"Astonished her with order, silence, law:"
3861,THIRD BOOK.,"And when a gentle hand held out a cup,"
3862,THIRD BOOK.,"She took it, as you do at sacrament,"
3863,THIRD BOOK.,"Half awed, half melted,—not being used, indeed,"
3864,THIRD BOOK.,To so much love as makes the form of love
3865,THIRD BOOK.,And courtesy of manners. Delicate drinks
3866,THIRD BOOK.,"And rare white bread, to which some dying eyes"
3867,THIRD BOOK.,"Were turned in observation. O my God,"
3868,THIRD BOOK.,"How sick we must be, ere we make men just!"
3869,THIRD BOOK.,I think it frets the saints in heaven to see
3870,THIRD BOOK.,How many desolate creatures on the earth
3871,THIRD BOOK.,Have learnt the simple dues of fellowship
3872,THIRD BOOK.,"And social comfort, in a hospital,"
3873,THIRD BOOK.,"As Marian did. She lay there, stunned, half tranced,"
3874,THIRD BOOK.,"And wished, at intervals of growing sense,"
3875,THIRD BOOK.,"She might be sicker yet, if sickness made"
3876,THIRD BOOK.,"The world so marvellous kind, the air so hushed,"
3877,THIRD BOOK.,And all her wake-time quiet as a sleep;
3878,THIRD BOOK.,"For now she understood, (as such things were)"
3879,THIRD BOOK.,"How sickness ended very oft in heaven,"
3880,THIRD BOOK.,"Among the unspoken raptures. Yet more sick,"
3881,THIRD BOOK.,"And surelier happy. Then she dropped her lids,"
3882,THIRD BOOK.,"And, folding up her hands as flowers at night,"
3883,THIRD BOOK.,Would lose no moment of the blessed time.
3884,THIRD BOOK.,
3885,THIRD BOOK.,"She lay and seethed in fever many weeks,"
3886,THIRD BOOK.,But youth was strong and overcame the test;
3887,THIRD BOOK.,Revolted soul and flesh were reconciled
3888,THIRD BOOK.,And fetched back to the necessary day
3889,THIRD BOOK.,And daylight duties. She could creep about
3890,THIRD BOOK.,"The long bare rooms, and stare out drearily"
3891,THIRD BOOK.,"From any narrow window on the street,"
3892,THIRD BOOK.,"Till some one, who had nursed her as a friend,"
3893,THIRD BOOK.,"Said coldly to her, as an enemy,"
3894,THIRD BOOK.,"‘She had leave to go next week, being well enough,’"
3895,THIRD BOOK.,"While only her heart ached. ‘Go next week,’ thought she,"
3896,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Next week! how would it be with her next week,"
3897,THIRD BOOK.,Let out into that terrible street alone
3898,THIRD BOOK.,"Among the pushing people, ... to go ... where?’"
3899,THIRD BOOK.,
3900,THIRD BOOK.,"One day, the last before the dreaded last,"
3901,THIRD BOOK.,"Among the convalescents, like herself"
3902,THIRD BOOK.,"Prepared to go next morning, she sate dumb,"
3903,THIRD BOOK.,"And heard half absently the women talk,"
3904,THIRD BOOK.,How one was famished for her baby’s cheeks—
3905,THIRD BOOK.,"‘The little wretch would know her! a year old,"
3906,THIRD BOOK.,"And lively, like his father!’ one was keen"
3907,THIRD BOOK.,"To get to work, and fill some clamorous mouths;"
3908,THIRD BOOK.,And one was tender for her dear goodman
3909,THIRD BOOK.,"Who had missed her sorely,—and one, querulous ..."
3910,THIRD BOOK.,‘Would pay those scandalous neighbours who had dared
3911,THIRD BOOK.,"To talk about her as already dead,’—"
3912,THIRD BOOK.,And one was proud ... ‘and if her sweetheart Luke
3913,THIRD BOOK.,"Had left her for a ruddier face than hers,"
3914,THIRD BOOK.,(The gossip would be seen through at a glance)
3915,THIRD BOOK.,Sweet riddance of such sweethearts—let him hang!
3916,THIRD BOOK.,’Twere good to have been as sick for such an end.’
3917,THIRD BOOK.,
3918,THIRD BOOK.,"And while they talked, and Marian felt the worse"
3919,THIRD BOOK.,"For having missed the worst of all their wrongs,"
3920,THIRD BOOK.,A visitor was ushered through the wards
3921,THIRD BOOK.,"And paused among the talkers. ‘When he looked,"
3922,THIRD BOOK.,"It was as if he spoke, and when he spoke"
3923,THIRD BOOK.,"He sang perhaps,’ said Marian; ‘could she tell?"
3924,THIRD BOOK.,"She only knew’ (so much she had chronicled,"
3925,THIRD BOOK.,"As seraphs might, the making of the sun)"
3926,THIRD BOOK.,"‘That he who came and spake, was Romney Leigh,"
3927,THIRD BOOK.,"And then, and there, she saw and heard him first.’"
3928,THIRD BOOK.,And when it was her turn to have the face
3929,THIRD BOOK.,"Upon her,—all those buzzing pallid lips"
3930,THIRD BOOK.,Being satisfied with comfort—when he changed
3931,THIRD BOOK.,"To Marian, saying ‘And _you_? you’re going, where?’—"
3932,THIRD BOOK.,"She, moveless as a worm beneath a stone"
3933,THIRD BOOK.,"Which some one’s stumbling foot has spurned aside,"
3934,THIRD BOOK.,"Writhed suddenly, astonished with the light,"
3935,THIRD BOOK.,"And breaking into sobs cried, ‘Where I go?"
3936,THIRD BOOK.,None asked me till this moment. Can I say
3937,THIRD BOOK.,Where _I_ go? when it has not seemed worth while
3938,THIRD BOOK.,"To God himself, who thinks of every one,"
3939,THIRD BOOK.,"To think of me, and fix where I shall go?’"
3940,THIRD BOOK.,
3941,THIRD BOOK.,"‘So young,’ he gently asked her, ‘you have lost"
3942,THIRD BOOK.,Your father and your mother?’
3943,THIRD BOOK.,"‘Both,’ she said,"
3944,THIRD BOOK.,‘Both lost! my father was burnt up with gin
3945,THIRD BOOK.,"Or ever I sucked milk, and so is lost."
3946,THIRD BOOK.,"My mother sold me to a man last month,"
3947,THIRD BOOK.,"And so my mother’s lost, ’tis manifest."
3948,THIRD BOOK.,"And I, who fled from her for miles and miles,"
3949,THIRD BOOK.,As if I had caught sight of the fires of hell
3950,THIRD BOOK.,"Through some wild gap, (she was my mother, sir)"
3951,THIRD BOOK.,"It seems I shall be lost too, presently,"
3952,THIRD BOOK.,"And so we end, all three of us.’"
3953,THIRD BOOK.,‘Poor child!’
3954,THIRD BOOK.,"He said,—with such a pity in his voice,"
3955,THIRD BOOK.,"It soothed her more than her own tears,—‘poor child!"
3956,THIRD BOOK.,’Tis simple that betrayal by mother’s love
3957,THIRD BOOK.,Should bring despair of God’s too. Yet be taught;
3958,THIRD BOOK.,"He’s better to us than many mothers are,"
3959,THIRD BOOK.,And children cannot wander beyond reach
3960,THIRD BOOK.,Of the sweep of his white raiment. Touch and hold!
3961,THIRD BOOK.,"And if you weep still, weep where John was laid"
3962,THIRD BOOK.,While Jesus loved him.’
3963,THIRD BOOK.,"‘She could say the words,’"
3964,THIRD BOOK.,"She told me, ‘exactly as he uttered them"
3965,THIRD BOOK.,"A year back, ... since, in any doubt or dark,"
3966,THIRD BOOK.,"They came out like the stars, and shone on her"
3967,THIRD BOOK.,"With just their comfort. Common words, perhaps;"
3968,THIRD BOOK.,The ministers in church might say the same;
3969,THIRD BOOK.,"But _he_, he made the church with what he spoke,—"
3970,THIRD BOOK.,"The difference was the miracle,’ said she."
3971,THIRD BOOK.,
3972,THIRD BOOK.,"Then catching up her smile to ravishment,"
3973,THIRD BOOK.,"She added quickly, ‘I repeat his words,"
3974,THIRD BOOK.,But not his tones: can any one repeat
3975,THIRD BOOK.,"The music of an organ, out of church?"
3976,THIRD BOOK.,"And when he said ‘poor child,’ I shut my eyes"
3977,THIRD BOOK.,"To feel how tenderly his voice broke through,"
3978,THIRD BOOK.,As the ointment-box broke on the Holy feet
3979,THIRD BOOK.,To let out the rich medicative nard.’
3980,THIRD BOOK.,
3981,THIRD BOOK.,She told me how he had raised and rescued her
3982,THIRD BOOK.,"With reverent pity, as, in touching grief,"
3983,THIRD BOOK.,"He touched the wounds of Christ,—and made her feel"
3984,THIRD BOOK.,"More self-respecting. Hope, he called, belief"
3985,THIRD BOOK.,"In God,—work, worship ... therefore let us pray!"
3986,THIRD BOOK.,"And thus, to snatch her soul from atheism,"
3987,THIRD BOOK.,"And keep it stainless from her mother’s face,"
3988,THIRD BOOK.,He sent her to a famous sempstress-house
3989,THIRD BOOK.,"Far off in London, there to work and hope."
3990,THIRD BOOK.,
3991,THIRD BOOK.,"With that, they parted. She kept sight of Heaven,"
3992,THIRD BOOK.,But not of Romney. He had good to do
3993,THIRD BOOK.,"To others: through the days and through the nights,"
3994,THIRD BOOK.,"She sewed and sewed and sewed. She drooped sometimes,"
3995,THIRD BOOK.,"And wondered, while, along the tawny light,"
3996,THIRD BOOK.,"She struck the new thread into her needle’s eye,"
3997,THIRD BOOK.,"How people, without mothers on the hills,"
3998,THIRD BOOK.,Could choose the town to live in!—then she drew
3999,THIRD BOOK.,"The stitch, and mused how Romney’s face would look,"
4000,THIRD BOOK.,"And if ’twere likely he’d remember hers,"
4001,THIRD BOOK.,When they two had their meeting after death.
4002,THIRD BOOK.,
4003,THIRD BOOK.,
4004,THIRD BOOK.,
4005,THIRD BOOK.,
4006,FOURTH BOOK.,FOURTH BOOK.
4007,FOURTH BOOK.,
4008,FOURTH BOOK.,
4009,FOURTH BOOK.,THEY met still sooner. ’Twas a year from thence
4010,FOURTH BOOK.,"When Lucy Gresham, the sick sempstress girl,"
4011,FOURTH BOOK.,"Who sewed by Marian’s chair so still and quick,"
4012,FOURTH BOOK.,And leant her head upon the back to cough
4013,FOURTH BOOK.,"More freely when, the mistress turning round,"
4014,FOURTH BOOK.,"The others took occasion to laugh out,—"
4015,FOURTH BOOK.,"Gave up at last. Among the workers, spoke"
4016,FOURTH BOOK.,"A bold girl with black eyebrows and red lips,—"
4017,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘You know the news? Who’s dying, do you think?"
4018,FOURTH BOOK.,Our Lucy Gresham. I expected it
4019,FOURTH BOOK.,"As little as Nell Hart’s wedding. Blush not, Nell,"
4020,FOURTH BOOK.,Thy curls be red enough without thy cheeks;
4021,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, some day, there’ll be found a man to dote"
4022,FOURTH BOOK.,"On red curls.—Lucy Gresham swooned last night,"
4023,FOURTH BOOK.,Dropped sudden in the street while going home;
4024,FOURTH BOOK.,"And now the baker says, who took her up"
4025,FOURTH BOOK.,"And laid her by her grandmother in bed,"
4026,FOURTH BOOK.,He’ll give her a week to die in. Pass the silk.
4027,FOURTH BOOK.,"Let’s hope he gave her a loaf too, within reach,"
4028,FOURTH BOOK.,"For otherwise they’ll starve before they die,"
4029,FOURTH BOOK.,"That funny pair of bedfellows! Miss Bell,"
4030,FOURTH BOOK.,I’ll thank you for the scissors. The old crone
4031,FOURTH BOOK.,Is paralytic—that’s the reason why
4032,FOURTH BOOK.,"Our Lucy’s thread went faster than her breath,"
4033,FOURTH BOOK.,"Which went too quick, we all know. Marian Erle!"
4034,FOURTH BOOK.,"Why, Marian Erle, you’re not the fool to cry?"
4035,FOURTH BOOK.,"Your tears spoil Lady Waldemar’s new dress,"
4036,FOURTH BOOK.,You piece of pity!’
4037,FOURTH BOOK.,"Marian rose up straight,"
4038,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, breaking through the talk and through the work,"
4039,FOURTH BOOK.,"Went outward, in the face of their surprise,"
4040,FOURTH BOOK.,"To Lucy’s home, to nurse her back to life"
4041,FOURTH BOOK.,"Or down to death. She knew, by such an act,"
4042,FOURTH BOOK.,"All place and grace were forfeit in the house,"
4043,FOURTH BOOK.,Whose mistress would supply the missing hand
4044,FOURTH BOOK.,"With necessary, not inhuman haste,"
4045,FOURTH BOOK.,"And take no blame. But pity, too, had dues:"
4046,FOURTH BOOK.,She could not leave a solitary soul
4047,FOURTH BOOK.,"To founder in the dark, while she sate still"
4048,FOURTH BOOK.,And lavished stitches on a lady’s hem
4049,FOURTH BOOK.,As if no other work were paramount.
4050,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Why, God,’ thought Marian, ‘has a missing hand"
4051,FOURTH BOOK.,"This moment; Lucy wants a drink, perhaps."
4052,FOURTH BOOK.,"Let others miss me! never miss me, God!’"
4053,FOURTH BOOK.,
4054,FOURTH BOOK.,"So Marian sate by Lucy’s bed, content"
4055,FOURTH BOOK.,"With duty, and was strong, for recompense,"
4056,FOURTH BOOK.,To hold the lamp of human love arm-high
4057,FOURTH BOOK.,"To catch the death-strained eyes and comfort them,"
4058,FOURTH BOOK.,"Until the angels, on the luminous side"
4059,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of death, had got theirs ready. And she said,"
4060,FOURTH BOOK.,"When Lucy thanked her sometimes, called her kind,"
4061,FOURTH BOOK.,"It touched her strangely. ‘Marian Erle, called kind!"
4062,FOURTH BOOK.,"What, Marian, beaten and sold, who could not die!"
4063,FOURTH BOOK.,’Tis verily good fortune to be kind.
4064,FOURTH BOOK.,"Ah, you,’ she said, ‘who are born to such a grace,"
4065,FOURTH BOOK.,"Be sorry for the unlicensed class, the poor,"
4066,FOURTH BOOK.,Reduced to think the best good fortune means
4067,FOURTH BOOK.,"That others, simply, should be kind to them.’"
4068,FOURTH BOOK.,
4069,FOURTH BOOK.,From sleep to sleep while Lucy slid away
4070,FOURTH BOOK.,"So gently, like the light upon a hill,"
4071,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of which none names the moment that it goes,"
4072,FOURTH BOOK.,"Though all see when ’tis gone,—a man came in"
4073,FOURTH BOOK.,And stood beside the bed. The old idiot wretch
4074,FOURTH BOOK.,"Screamed feebly, like a baby overlain,"
4075,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Sir, sir, you won’t mistake me for the corpse?"
4076,FOURTH BOOK.,"Don’t look at _me_, sir! never bury _me_!"
4077,FOURTH BOOK.,"Although I lie here, I’m alive as you,"
4078,FOURTH BOOK.,"Except my legs and arms,—I eat and drink,"
4079,FOURTH BOOK.,"And understand,—(that you’re the gentleman"
4080,FOURTH BOOK.,"Who fits the funerals up, Heaven speed you, sir,)"
4081,FOURTH BOOK.,And certainly I should be livelier still
4082,FOURTH BOOK.,"If Lucy here ... sir, Lucy is the corpse ..."
4083,FOURTH BOOK.,Had worked more properly to buy me wine:
4084,FOURTH BOOK.,"But Lucy, sir, was always slow at work,"
4085,FOURTH BOOK.,"I shan’t lose much by Lucy. Marian Erle,"
4086,FOURTH BOOK.,Speak up and show the gentleman the corpse.’
4087,FOURTH BOOK.,
4088,FOURTH BOOK.,"And then a voice said, ‘Marian Erle.’ She rose;"
4089,FOURTH BOOK.,"It was the hour for angels—there, stood hers!"
4090,FOURTH BOOK.,She scarcely marvelled to see Romney Leigh.
4091,FOURTH BOOK.,"As light November snows to empty nests,"
4092,FOURTH BOOK.,"As grass to graves, as moss to mildewed stones,"
4093,FOURTH BOOK.,"As July suns to ruins, through the rents,"
4094,FOURTH BOOK.,"As ministering spirits to mourners, through a loss,"
4095,FOURTH BOOK.,"As Heaven itself to men, through pangs of death,"
4096,FOURTH BOOK.,He came uncalled wherever grief had come.
4097,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘And so,’ said Marian Erle, ‘we met anew,’"
4098,FOURTH BOOK.,"And added softly, ‘so, we shall not part.’"
4099,FOURTH BOOK.,
4100,FOURTH BOOK.,He was not angry that she had left the house
4101,FOURTH BOOK.,Wherein he placed her. Well—she had feared it might
4102,FOURTH BOOK.,"Have vexed him. Also, when he found her set"
4103,FOURTH BOOK.,"On keeping, though the dead was out of sight,"
4104,FOURTH BOOK.,"That half-dead, half-live body left behind"
4105,FOURTH BOOK.,"With cankerous heart and flesh,—which took your best"
4106,FOURTH BOOK.,"And cursed you for the little good it did,"
4107,FOURTH BOOK.,"(Could any leave the bedrid wretch alone,"
4108,FOURTH BOOK.,"So joyless, she was thankless even to God,"
4109,FOURTH BOOK.,"Much less to you?) he did not say ’twas well,"
4110,FOURTH BOOK.,"Yet Marian thought he did not take it ill,—"
4111,FOURTH BOOK.,"Since day by day he came, and, every day,"
4112,FOURTH BOOK.,She felt within his utterance and his eyes
4113,FOURTH BOOK.,"A closer, tenderer presence of the soul,"
4114,FOURTH BOOK.,"Until at last he said, ‘We shall not part.’"
4115,FOURTH BOOK.,
4116,FOURTH BOOK.,"On that same day, was Marian’s work complete:"
4117,FOURTH BOOK.,"She had smoothed the empty bed, and swept the floor"
4118,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of coffin sawdust, set the chairs anew"
4119,FOURTH BOOK.,"The dead had ended gossip in, and stood"
4120,FOURTH BOOK.,"In that poor room so cold and orderly,"
4121,FOURTH BOOK.,"The door-key in her hand, prepared to go"
4122,FOURTH BOOK.,"As _they_ had, howbeit not their way. He spoke."
4123,FOURTH BOOK.,
4124,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Dear Marian, of one clay God made us all,"
4125,FOURTH BOOK.,And though men push and poke and paddle in’t
4126,FOURTH BOOK.,(As children play at fashioning dirt-pies)
4127,FOURTH BOOK.,"And call their fancies by the name of facts,"
4128,FOURTH BOOK.,"Assuming difference, lordship, privilege,"
4129,FOURTH BOOK.,"When all’s plain dirt,—they come back to it at last;"
4130,FOURTH BOOK.,"The first grave-digger proves it with a spade,"
4131,FOURTH BOOK.,"And pats all even. Need we wait for this,"
4132,FOURTH BOOK.,"You, Marian, and I, Romney?’"
4133,FOURTH BOOK.,"She, at that,"
4134,FOURTH BOOK.,"Looked blindly in his face, as when one looks"
4135,FOURTH BOOK.,Through driving autumn-rains to find the sky.
4136,FOURTH BOOK.,He went on speaking.
4137,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Marian, I being born"
4138,FOURTH BOOK.,"What men call noble, and you, issued from"
4139,FOURTH BOOK.,"The noble people,—though the tyrannous sword"
4140,FOURTH BOOK.,"Which pierced Christ’s heart, has cleft the world in twain"
4141,FOURTH BOOK.,"’Twixt class and class, opposing rich to poor,—"
4142,FOURTH BOOK.,Shall _we_ keep parted? Not so. Let us lean
4143,FOURTH BOOK.,"And strain together rather, each to each,"
4144,FOURTH BOOK.,"Compress the red lips of this gaping wound,"
4145,FOURTH BOOK.,"As far as two souls can,—ay, lean and league,"
4146,FOURTH BOOK.,"I, from my superabundance,—from your want,"
4147,FOURTH BOOK.,"You,—joining in a protest ’gainst the wrong"
4148,FOURTH BOOK.,On both sides!’—
4149,FOURTH BOOK.,"All the rest, he held her hand"
4150,FOURTH BOOK.,"In speaking, which confused the sense of much;"
4151,FOURTH BOOK.,"Her heart, against his words, beat out so thick,"
4152,FOURTH BOOK.,They might as well be written on the dust
4153,FOURTH BOOK.,"Where some poor bird, escaping from hawk’s beak,"
4154,FOURTH BOOK.,"Has dropped, and beats its shuddering wings,—the lines"
4155,FOURTH BOOK.,"Are rubbed so,—yet ’twas something like to this,"
4156,FOURTH BOOK.,"—‘That they two, standing at the two extremes"
4157,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of social classes, had received one seal,"
4158,FOURTH BOOK.,Been dedicate and drawn beyond themselves
4159,FOURTH BOOK.,"To mercy and ministration,—he, indeed,"
4160,FOURTH BOOK.,"Through what he knew, and she, through what she felt,"
4161,FOURTH BOOK.,"He, by man’s conscience, she, by woman’s heart,"
4162,FOURTH BOOK.,Relinquishing their several ’vantage posts
4163,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of wealthy ease and honourable toil,"
4164,FOURTH BOOK.,"To work with God at love. And, since God willed"
4165,FOURTH BOOK.,"That, putting out his hand to touch this ark,"
4166,FOURTH BOOK.,"He found a woman’s hand there, he’d accept"
4167,FOURTH BOOK.,"The sign too, hold the tender fingers fast,"
4168,FOURTH BOOK.,"And say, ‘My fellow-worker, be my wife!’’"
4169,FOURTH BOOK.,
4170,FOURTH BOOK.,"She told the tale with simple, rustic turns,—"
4171,FOURTH BOOK.,Strong leaps of meaning in her sudden eyes
4172,FOURTH BOOK.,That took the gaps of any imperfect phrase
4173,FOURTH BOOK.,Of the unschooled speaker: I have rather writ
4174,FOURTH BOOK.,"The thing I understood so, than the thing"
4175,FOURTH BOOK.,I heard so. And I cannot render right
4176,FOURTH BOOK.,"Her quick gesticulation, wild yet soft,"
4177,FOURTH BOOK.,"Self-startled from the habitual mood she used,"
4178,FOURTH BOOK.,"Half sad, half languid,—like dumb creatures (now"
4179,FOURTH BOOK.,"A rustling bird, and now a wandering deer,"
4180,FOURTH BOOK.,Or squirrel against the oak-gloom flashing up
4181,FOURTH BOOK.,"His sidelong burnished head, in just her way"
4182,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of savage spontaneity,) that stir"
4183,FOURTH BOOK.,"Abruptly the green silence of the woods,"
4184,FOURTH BOOK.,"And make it stranger, holier, more profound;"
4185,FOURTH BOOK.,As Nature’s general heart confessed itself
4186,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of life, and then fell backward on repose."
4187,FOURTH BOOK.,
4188,FOURTH BOOK.,I kissed the lips that ended.—‘So indeed
4189,FOURTH BOOK.,"He loves you, Marian?’"
4190,FOURTH BOOK.,‘Loves me!’ She looked up
4191,FOURTH BOOK.,With a child’s wonder when you ask him first
4192,FOURTH BOOK.,"Who made the sun—a puzzled blush, that grew,"
4193,FOURTH BOOK.,Then broke off in a rapid radiant smile
4194,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of sure solution. ‘Loves me! he loves all,—"
4195,FOURTH BOOK.,"And me, of course. He had not asked me else"
4196,FOURTH BOOK.,"To work with him for ever, and be his wife.’"
4197,FOURTH BOOK.,
4198,FOURTH BOOK.,Her words reproved me. This perhaps was love—
4199,FOURTH BOOK.,"To have its hands too full of gifts to give,"
4200,FOURTH BOOK.,For putting out a hand to take a gift;
4201,FOURTH BOOK.,"To love so much, the perfect round of love"
4202,FOURTH BOOK.,"Includes, in strict conclusion, the being loved;"
4203,FOURTH BOOK.,"As Eden-dew went up and fell again,"
4204,FOURTH BOOK.,Enough for watering Eden. Obviously
4205,FOURTH BOOK.,She had not thought about his love at all:
4206,FOURTH BOOK.,"The cataracts of her soul had poured themselves,"
4207,FOURTH BOOK.,And risen self-crowned in rainbow: would she ask
4208,FOURTH BOOK.,Who crowned her?—it sufficed that she was crowned.
4209,FOURTH BOOK.,"With women of my class, ’tis otherwise:"
4210,FOURTH BOOK.,"We haggle for the small change of our gold,"
4211,FOURTH BOOK.,"And so much love, accord, for so much love,"
4212,FOURTH BOOK.,Rialto-prices. Are we therefore wrong?
4213,FOURTH BOOK.,"If marriage be a contract, look to it then,"
4214,FOURTH BOOK.,"Contracting parties should be equal, just;"
4215,FOURTH BOOK.,"But if, a simple fealty on one side,"
4216,FOURTH BOOK.,"A mere religion,—right to give, is all,"
4217,FOURTH BOOK.,And certain brides of Europe duly ask
4218,FOURTH BOOK.,"To mount the pile, as Indian widows do,"
4219,FOURTH BOOK.,"The spices of their tender youth heaped up,"
4220,FOURTH BOOK.,"The jewels of their gracious virtues worn,"
4221,FOURTH BOOK.,"More gems, more glory,—to consume entire"
4222,FOURTH BOOK.,"For a living husband! as the man’s alive,"
4223,FOURTH BOOK.,"Not dead,—the woman’s duty, by so much,"
4224,FOURTH BOOK.,"Advanced in England, beyond Hindostan."
4225,FOURTH BOOK.,
4226,FOURTH BOOK.,"I sate there, musing, till she touched my hand"
4227,FOURTH BOOK.,"With hers, as softly as a strange white bird"
4228,FOURTH BOOK.,She feared to startle in touching. ‘You are kind.
4229,FOURTH BOOK.,"But are you, peradventure, vexed at heart"
4230,FOURTH BOOK.,Because your cousin takes me for a wife?
4231,FOURTH BOOK.,"I know I am not worthy—nay, in truth,"
4232,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’m glad on’t, since, for that, he chooses me."
4233,FOURTH BOOK.,He likes the poor things of the world the best;
4234,FOURTH BOOK.,"I would not therefore, if I could, be rich."
4235,FOURTH BOOK.,It pleasures him to stoop for buttercups;
4236,FOURTH BOOK.,I would not be a rose upon the wall
4237,FOURTH BOOK.,"A queen might stop at, near the palace-door,"
4238,FOURTH BOOK.,"To say to a courtier, ‘Pluck that rose for me,"
4239,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘It’s prettier than the rest,’ O Romney Leigh!"
4240,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’d rather far be trodden by his foot,"
4241,FOURTH BOOK.,Than lie in a great queen’s bosom.’
4242,FOURTH BOOK.,Out of breath
4243,FOURTH BOOK.,She paused.
4244,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Sweet Marian, do you disavow"
4245,FOURTH BOOK.,The roses with that face?’
4246,FOURTH BOOK.,"She dropt her head,"
4247,FOURTH BOOK.,"As if the wind had caught that flower of her,"
4248,FOURTH BOOK.,"And bent it in the garden,—then looked up"
4249,FOURTH BOOK.,"With grave assurance. ‘Well, you think me bold!"
4250,FOURTH BOOK.,"But so we all are, when we’re praying God."
4251,FOURTH BOOK.,"And if I’m bold—yet, lady, credit me,"
4252,FOURTH BOOK.,"That, since I know myself for what I am,"
4253,FOURTH BOOK.,"Much fitter for his handmaid than his wife,"
4254,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’ll prove the handmaid and the wife at once,"
4255,FOURTH BOOK.,"Serve tenderly, and love obediently,"
4256,FOURTH BOOK.,"And be a worthier mate, perhaps, than some"
4257,FOURTH BOOK.,Who are wooed in silk among their learned books;
4258,FOURTH BOOK.,"While _I_ shall set myself to read his eyes,"
4259,FOURTH BOOK.,Till such grow plainer to me than the French
4260,FOURTH BOOK.,To wisest ladies. Do you think I’ll miss
4261,FOURTH BOOK.,"A letter, in the spelling of his mind?"
4262,FOURTH BOOK.,"No more than they do, when they sit and write"
4263,FOURTH BOOK.,"Their flying words with flickering wild-fowl tails,"
4264,FOURTH BOOK.,"Nor ever pause to ask how many _t_s,"
4265,FOURTH BOOK.,Should that be _y_ or _i_—they know’t so well:
4266,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’ve seen them writing, when I brought a dress"
4267,FOURTH BOOK.,"And waited,—floating out their soft white hands"
4268,FOURTH BOOK.,"On shining paper. But they’re hard sometimes,"
4269,FOURTH BOOK.,"For all those hands!—we’ve used out many nights,"
4270,FOURTH BOOK.,And worn the yellow daylight into shreds
4271,FOURTH BOOK.,Which flapped and shivered down our aching eyes
4272,FOURTH BOOK.,"Till night appeared more tolerable, just"
4273,FOURTH BOOK.,"That pretty ladies might look beautiful,"
4274,FOURTH BOOK.,Who said at last ... ‘You’re lazy in that house!
4275,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘You’re slow in sending home the work,—I count"
4276,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’ve waited near an hour for’t.’ Pardon me,—"
4277,FOURTH BOOK.,"I do not blame them, madam, nor misprize;"
4278,FOURTH BOOK.,"They are fair and gracious; ay, but not like you,"
4279,FOURTH BOOK.,Since none but you has Mister Leigh’s own blood
4280,FOURTH BOOK.,"Both noble and gentle,—and, without it ... well,"
4281,FOURTH BOOK.,"They are fair, I said; so fair, it scarce seems strange"
4282,FOURTH BOOK.,"That, flashing out in any looking-glass"
4283,FOURTH BOOK.,"The wonder of their glorious brows and breasts,"
4284,FOURTH BOOK.,"They are charmed so, they forget to look behind"
4285,FOURTH BOOK.,"And mark how pale we’ve grown, we pitiful"
4286,FOURTH BOOK.,"Remainders of the world. And so, perhaps,"
4287,FOURTH BOOK.,"If Mister Leigh had chosen a wife from these,"
4288,FOURTH BOOK.,"She might ... although he’s better than her best,"
4289,FOURTH BOOK.,And dearly she would know it ... steal a thought
4290,FOURTH BOOK.,"Which should be all his, an eye-glance from his face,"
4291,FOURTH BOOK.,"To plunge into the mirror opposite,"
4292,FOURTH BOOK.,In search of her own beauty’s pearl: while _I_....
4293,FOURTH BOOK.,"Ah, dearest lady, serge will outweigh silk"
4294,FOURTH BOOK.,"For winter-wear, when bodies feel a-cold,"
4295,FOURTH BOOK.,And I’ll be a true wife to your cousin Leigh.’
4296,FOURTH BOOK.,
4297,FOURTH BOOK.,"Before I answered, he was there himself."
4298,FOURTH BOOK.,"I think he had been standing in the room,"
4299,FOURTH BOOK.,"And listened probably to half her talk,"
4300,FOURTH BOOK.,"Arrested, turned to stone,—as white as stone."
4301,FOURTH BOOK.,Will tender sayings make men look so white?
4302,FOURTH BOOK.,He loves her then profoundly.
4303,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘You are here,"
4304,FOURTH BOOK.,Aurora? Here I meet you!’—We clasped hands.
4305,FOURTH BOOK.,
4306,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Even so, dear Romney. Lady Waldemar"
4307,FOURTH BOOK.,Has sent me in haste to find a cousin of mine
4308,FOURTH BOOK.,Who shall be.’
4309,FOURTH BOOK.,
4310,FOURTH BOOK.,‘Lady Waldemar is good.’
4311,FOURTH BOOK.,
4312,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Here’s one, at least, who is good,’ I sighed, and touched"
4313,FOURTH BOOK.,"Poor Marian’s happy head, as, doglike, she"
4314,FOURTH BOOK.,"Most passionately patient, waited on,"
4315,FOURTH BOOK.,A-tremble for her turn of greeting words;
4316,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘I’ve sate a full hour with your Marian Erle,"
4317,FOURTH BOOK.,"And learnt the thing by heart,—and, from my heart,"
4318,FOURTH BOOK.,Am therefore competent to give you thanks
4319,FOURTH BOOK.,For such a cousin.’
4320,FOURTH BOOK.,‘You accept at last
4321,FOURTH BOOK.,"A gift from me, Aurora, without scorn?"
4322,FOURTH BOOK.,At last I please you?’—How his voice was changed!
4323,FOURTH BOOK.,
4324,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘You cannot please a woman against her will,"
4325,FOURTH BOOK.,And once you vexed me. Shall we speak of that?
4326,FOURTH BOOK.,"We’ll say, then, you were noble in it all,"
4327,FOURTH BOOK.,"And I not ignorant—let it pass. And now,"
4328,FOURTH BOOK.,"You please me, Romney, when you please yourself;"
4329,FOURTH BOOK.,"So, please you, be fanatical in love,"
4330,FOURTH BOOK.,"And I’m well pleased. Ah, cousin! at the old hall,"
4331,FOURTH BOOK.,"Among the gallery portraits of our Leighs,"
4332,FOURTH BOOK.,We shall not find a sweeter signory
4333,FOURTH BOOK.,Than this pure forehead’s.’
4334,FOURTH BOOK.,Not a word he said.
4335,FOURTH BOOK.,"How arrogant men are!—Even philanthropists,"
4336,FOURTH BOOK.,Who try to take a wife up in the way
4337,FOURTH BOOK.,"They put down a subscription-cheque,—if once"
4338,FOURTH BOOK.,"She turns and says, ‘I will not tax you so,"
4339,FOURTH BOOK.,"Most charitable sir,’—feel ill at ease,"
4340,FOURTH BOOK.,As though she had wronged them somehow. I suppose
4341,FOURTH BOOK.,"We women should remember what we are,"
4342,FOURTH BOOK.,And not throw back an obolus inscribed
4343,FOURTH BOOK.,"With Cæsar’s image, lightly. I resumed."
4344,FOURTH BOOK.,
4345,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘It strikes me, some of those sublime Vandykes"
4346,FOURTH BOOK.,"Were not too proud, to make good saints in heaven;"
4347,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, if so, then they’re not too proud to-day"
4348,FOURTH BOOK.,To bow down (now the ruffs are off their necks)
4349,FOURTH BOOK.,"And own this good, true, noble Marian, ... yours,"
4350,FOURTH BOOK.,"And mine, I’ll say!—For poets (bear the word)"
4351,FOURTH BOOK.,"Half-poets even, are still whole democrats,—"
4352,FOURTH BOOK.,"Oh, not that we’re disloyal to the high,"
4353,FOURTH BOOK.,"But loyal to the low, and cognisant"
4354,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of the less scrutable majesties. For me,"
4355,FOURTH BOOK.,I comprehend your choice—I justify
4356,FOURTH BOOK.,Your right in choosing.’
4357,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘No, no, no,’ he sighed,"
4358,FOURTH BOOK.,"With a sort of melancholy impatient scorn,"
4359,FOURTH BOOK.,"As some grown man, who never had a child,"
4360,FOURTH BOOK.,Puts by some child who plays at being a man;
4361,FOURTH BOOK.,"—‘You did not, do not, cannot comprehend"
4362,FOURTH BOOK.,"My choice, my ends, my motives, nor myself:"
4363,FOURTH BOOK.,"No matter now—we’ll let it pass, you say."
4364,FOURTH BOOK.,I thank you for your generous cousinship
4365,FOURTH BOOK.,Which helps this present; I accept for her
4366,FOURTH BOOK.,"Your favourable thoughts. We’re fallen on days,"
4367,FOURTH BOOK.,"We two, who are not poets, when to wed"
4368,FOURTH BOOK.,"Requires less mutual love than common love,"
4369,FOURTH BOOK.,For two together to bear out at once
4370,FOURTH BOOK.,"Upon the loveless many. Work in pairs,"
4371,FOURTH BOOK.,"In galley-couplings or in marriage-rings,"
4372,FOURTH BOOK.,"The difference lies in the honour, not the work,—"
4373,FOURTH BOOK.,"And such we’re bound to, I and she. But love,"
4374,FOURTH BOOK.,(You poets are benighted in this age;
4375,FOURTH BOOK.,"The hour’s too late for catching even moths,"
4376,FOURTH BOOK.,"You’ve gnats instead,) love!—love’s fool-paradise"
4377,FOURTH BOOK.,"Is out of date, like Adam’s. Set a swan"
4378,FOURTH BOOK.,"To swim the Trenton, rather than true love"
4379,FOURTH BOOK.,To float its fabulous plumage safely down
4380,FOURTH BOOK.,"The cataracts of this loud transition-time,—"
4381,FOURTH BOOK.,"Whose roar, for ever, henceforth, in my ears,"
4382,FOURTH BOOK.,Must keep me deaf to music.’
4383,FOURTH BOOK.,"There, I turned"
4384,FOURTH BOOK.,"And kissed poor Marian, out of discontent."
4385,FOURTH BOOK.,"The man had baffled, chafed me, till I flung"
4386,FOURTH BOOK.,"For refuge to the woman,—as, sometimes,"
4387,FOURTH BOOK.,"Impatient of some crowded room’s close smell,"
4388,FOURTH BOOK.,"You throw a window open, and lean out"
4389,FOURTH BOOK.,"To breathe a long breath in the dewy night,"
4390,FOURTH BOOK.,"And cool your angry forehead. She, at least,"
4391,FOURTH BOOK.,"Was not built up, as walls are, brick by brick;"
4392,FOURTH BOOK.,"Each fancy squared, each feeling ranged by line,"
4393,FOURTH BOOK.,The very heat of burning youth applied
4394,FOURTH BOOK.,"To indurate forms and systems! excellent bricks,"
4395,FOURTH BOOK.,"A well-built wall,—which stops you on the road,"
4396,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, into which, you cannot see an inch"
4397,FOURTH BOOK.,Although you beat your head against it—pshaw!
4398,FOURTH BOOK.,
4399,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Adieu,’ I said, ‘for this time, cousins both;"
4400,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, cousin Romney, pardon me the word,"
4401,FOURTH BOOK.,"Be happy!—oh, in some esoteric sense"
4402,FOURTH BOOK.,Of course!—I mean no harm in wishing well.
4403,FOURTH BOOK.,"Adieu, my Marian:—may she come to me,"
4404,FOURTH BOOK.,"Dear Romney, and be married from my house?"
4405,FOURTH BOOK.,It is not part of your philosophy
4406,FOURTH BOOK.,To keep your bird upon the blackthorn?’
4407,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Ay,’"
4408,FOURTH BOOK.,"He answered, ‘but it is:—I take my wife"
4409,FOURTH BOOK.,"Directly from the people,—and she comes,"
4410,FOURTH BOOK.,"As Austria’s daughter to imperial France,"
4411,FOURTH BOOK.,"Betwixt her eagles, blinking not her race,"
4412,FOURTH BOOK.,"From Margaret’s Court at garret-height, to meet"
4413,FOURTH BOOK.,"And wed me at St. James’s, nor put off"
4414,FOURTH BOOK.,"Her gown of serge for that. The things we do,"
4415,FOURTH BOOK.,"We do: we’ll wear no mask, as if we blushed.’"
4416,FOURTH BOOK.,
4417,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Dear Romney, you’re the poet,’ I replied,—"
4418,FOURTH BOOK.,"But felt my smile too mournful for my word,"
4419,FOURTH BOOK.,"And turned and went. Ay, masks, I thought,—beware"
4420,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of tragic masks, we tie before the glass,"
4421,FOURTH BOOK.,Uplifted on the cothurn half a yard
4422,FOURTH BOOK.,Above the natural stature! we would play
4423,FOURTH BOOK.,"Heroic parts to ourselves,—and end, perhaps,"
4424,FOURTH BOOK.,As impotently as Athenian wives
4425,FOURTH BOOK.,Who shrieked in fits at the Eumenides.
4426,FOURTH BOOK.,
4427,FOURTH BOOK.,"His foot pursued me down the stair. ‘At least,"
4428,FOURTH BOOK.,You’ll suffer me to walk with you beyond
4429,FOURTH BOOK.,"These hideous streets, these graves, where men alive,"
4430,FOURTH BOOK.,"Packed close with earthworms, burr unconsciously"
4431,FOURTH BOOK.,About the plague that slew them; let me go.
4432,FOURTH BOOK.,The very women pelt their souls in mud
4433,FOURTH BOOK.,At any woman who walks here alone.
4434,FOURTH BOOK.,How came you here alone?—you are ignorant.’
4435,FOURTH BOOK.,
4436,FOURTH BOOK.,We had a strange and melancholy walk:
4437,FOURTH BOOK.,The night came drizzling downward in dark rain;
4438,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, as we walked, the colour of the time,"
4439,FOURTH BOOK.,"The act, the presence, my hand upon his arm,"
4440,FOURTH BOOK.,"His voice in my ear, and mine to my own sense,"
4441,FOURTH BOOK.,"Appeared unnatural. We talked modern books,"
4442,FOURTH BOOK.,"And daily papers; Spanish marriage-schemes,"
4443,FOURTH BOOK.,And English climate—was’t so cold last year?
4444,FOURTH BOOK.,And will the wind change by to-morrow morn?
4445,FOURTH BOOK.,Can Guizot stand? is London full? is trade
4446,FOURTH BOOK.,Competitive? has Dickens turned his hinge
4447,FOURTH BOOK.,A-pinch upon the fingers of the great?
4448,FOURTH BOOK.,And are potatoes to grow mythical
4449,FOURTH BOOK.,Like moly? will the apple die out too?
4450,FOURTH BOOK.,Which way is the wind to-night? south-east? due east?
4451,FOURTH BOOK.,"We talked on fast, while every common word"
4452,FOURTH BOOK.,"Seemed tangled with the thunder at one end,"
4453,FOURTH BOOK.,And ready to pull down upon our heads
4454,FOURTH BOOK.,A terror out of sight. And yet to pause
4455,FOURTH BOOK.,Were surelier mortal: we tore greedily up
4456,FOURTH BOOK.,"All silence, all the innocent breathing-points,"
4457,FOURTH BOOK.,"As if, like pale conspirators in haste,"
4458,FOURTH BOOK.,We tore up papers where our signatures
4459,FOURTH BOOK.,Imperilled us to an ugly shame or death.
4460,FOURTH BOOK.,
4461,FOURTH BOOK.,I cannot tell you why it was. ’Tis plain
4462,FOURTH BOOK.,We had not loved nor hated: wherefore dread
4463,FOURTH BOOK.,To spill gunpowder on ground safe from fire?
4464,FOURTH BOOK.,"Perhaps we had lived too closely, to diverge"
4465,FOURTH BOOK.,"So absolutely: leave two clocks, they say,"
4466,FOURTH BOOK.,"Wound up to different hours, upon one shelf,"
4467,FOURTH BOOK.,"And slowly, through the interior wheels of each,"
4468,FOURTH BOOK.,The blind mechanic motion sets itself
4469,FOURTH BOOK.,"A-throb, to feel out for the mutual time."
4470,FOURTH BOOK.,"It was not so with us, indeed. While he"
4471,FOURTH BOOK.,"Struck midnight, I kept striking six at dawn,"
4472,FOURTH BOOK.,"While he marked judgment, I, redemption-day;"
4473,FOURTH BOOK.,"And such exception to a general law,"
4474,FOURTH BOOK.,"Imperious upon inert matter even,"
4475,FOURTH BOOK.,"Might make us, each to either, insecure,"
4476,FOURTH BOOK.,"A beckoning mystery, or a troubling fear."
4477,FOURTH BOOK.,
4478,FOURTH BOOK.,"I mind me, when we parted at the door,"
4479,FOURTH BOOK.,"How strange his good-night sounded,—like good-night"
4480,FOURTH BOOK.,"Beside a deathbed, where the morrow’s sun"
4481,FOURTH BOOK.,Is sure to come too late for more good-days:—
4482,FOURTH BOOK.,"And all that night I thought.... ‘Good-night,’ said he."
4483,FOURTH BOOK.,
4484,FOURTH BOOK.,"And so, a month passed. Let me set it down"
4485,FOURTH BOOK.,"At once,—I have been wrong, I have been wrong."
4486,FOURTH BOOK.,"We are wrong always, when we think too much"
4487,FOURTH BOOK.,Of what we think or are; albeit our thoughts
4488,FOURTH BOOK.,"Be verily bitter as self-sacrifice,"
4489,FOURTH BOOK.,We’re no less selfish. If we sleep on rocks
4490,FOURTH BOOK.,"Or roses, sleeping past the hour of noon"
4491,FOURTH BOOK.,We’re lazy. This I write against myself.
4492,FOURTH BOOK.,I had done a duty in the visit paid
4493,FOURTH BOOK.,"To Marian, and was ready otherwise"
4494,FOURTH BOOK.,To give the witness of my presence and name
4495,FOURTH BOOK.,"Whenever she should marry.—Which, I thought,"
4496,FOURTH BOOK.,Sufficed. I even had cast into the scale
4497,FOURTH BOOK.,An overweight of justice toward the match;
4498,FOURTH BOOK.,"The Lady Waldemar had missed her tool,"
4499,FOURTH BOOK.,Had broken it in the lock as being too straight
4500,FOURTH BOOK.,"For a crooked purpose, while poor Marian Erle"
4501,FOURTH BOOK.,Missed nothing in my accents or my acts:
4502,FOURTH BOOK.,"I had not been ungenerous on the whole,"
4503,FOURTH BOOK.,"Nor yet untender; so, enough. I felt"
4504,FOURTH BOOK.,"Tired, overworked: this marriage somewhat jarred;"
4505,FOURTH BOOK.,"Or, if it did not, all the bridal noise ..."
4506,FOURTH BOOK.,"The pricking of the map of life with pins,"
4507,FOURTH BOOK.,"In schemes of ... ‘Here we’ll go,’ and ‘There we’ll stay,’"
4508,FOURTH BOOK.,"And ‘Everywhere we’ll prosper in our love,’"
4509,FOURTH BOOK.,Was scarce my business. Let them order it;
4510,FOURTH BOOK.,"Who else should care? I threw myself aside,"
4511,FOURTH BOOK.,As one who had done her work and shuts her eyes
4512,FOURTH BOOK.,To rest the better.
4513,FOURTH BOOK.,"I, who should have known,"
4514,FOURTH BOOK.,Forereckoned mischief! Where we disavow
4515,FOURTH BOOK.,"Being keeper to our brother, we’re his Cain."
4516,FOURTH BOOK.,
4517,FOURTH BOOK.,I might have held that poor child to my heart
4518,FOURTH BOOK.,A little longer! ’twould have hurt me much
4519,FOURTH BOOK.,"To have hastened by its beats the marriage-day,"
4520,FOURTH BOOK.,"And kept her safe meantime from tampering hands,"
4521,FOURTH BOOK.,"Or, peradventure, traps? What drew me back"
4522,FOURTH BOOK.,"From telling Romney plainly, the designs"
4523,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of Lady Waldemar, as spoken out"
4524,FOURTH BOOK.,"To me ... me? had I any right, ay, right,"
4525,FOURTH BOOK.,With womanly compassion and reserve
4526,FOURTH BOOK.,To break the fall of woman’s impudence?—
4527,FOURTH BOOK.,"To stand by calmly, knowing what I knew,"
4528,FOURTH BOOK.,And hear him call her _good_?
4529,FOURTH BOOK.,Distrust that word.
4530,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘There is none good save God,’ said Jesus Christ."
4531,FOURTH BOOK.,"If He once, in the first creation-week,"
4532,FOURTH BOOK.,"Called creatures good,—for ever, afterward,"
4533,FOURTH BOOK.,"The Devil only has done it, and his heirs,"
4534,FOURTH BOOK.,"The knaves who win so, and the fools who lose;"
4535,FOURTH BOOK.,"The word’s grown dangerous. In the middle age,"
4536,FOURTH BOOK.,I think they called malignant fays and imps
4537,FOURTH BOOK.,"Good people. A good neighbour, even in this,"
4538,FOURTH BOOK.,"Is fatal sometimes,—cuts your morning up"
4539,FOURTH BOOK.,"To mince-meat of the very smallest talk,"
4540,FOURTH BOOK.,Then helps to sugar her bohea at night
4541,FOURTH BOOK.,"With your reputation. I have known good wives,"
4542,FOURTH BOOK.,"As chaste, or nearly so, as Potiphar’s;"
4543,FOURTH BOOK.,"And good, good mothers, who would use a child"
4544,FOURTH BOOK.,"To better an intrigue; good friends, beside,"
4545,FOURTH BOOK.,(Very good) who hung succinctly round your neck
4546,FOURTH BOOK.,"And sucked your breath, as cats are fabled to do"
4547,FOURTH BOOK.,By sleeping infants. And we all have known
4548,FOURTH BOOK.,"Good critics, who have stamped out poet’s hopes;"
4549,FOURTH BOOK.,"Good statesmen, who pulled ruin on the state;"
4550,FOURTH BOOK.,"Good patriots, who, for a theory, risked a cause;"
4551,FOURTH BOOK.,"Good kings, who disembowelled for a tax;"
4552,FOURTH BOOK.,"Good popes, who brought all good to jeopardy;"
4553,FOURTH BOOK.,"Good Christians, who sate still in easy chairs,"
4554,FOURTH BOOK.,And damned the general world for standing up.—
4555,FOURTH BOOK.,"Now, may the good God pardon all good men!"
4556,FOURTH BOOK.,
4557,FOURTH BOOK.,"How bitterly I speak,—how certainly"
4558,FOURTH BOOK.,"The innocent white milk in us is turned,"
4559,FOURTH BOOK.,By much persistent shining of the sun!—
4560,FOURTH BOOK.,Shake up the sweetest in us long enough
4561,FOURTH BOOK.,"With men, it drops to foolish curd, too sour"
4562,FOURTH BOOK.,To feed the most untender of Christ’s lambs.
4563,FOURTH BOOK.,
4564,FOURTH BOOK.,I should have thought ... a woman of the world
4565,FOURTH BOOK.,"Like her I’m meaning,—centre to herself,"
4566,FOURTH BOOK.,Who has wheeled on her own pivot half a life
4567,FOURTH BOOK.,"In isolated self-love and self-will,"
4568,FOURTH BOOK.,As a windmill seen at distance radiating
4569,FOURTH BOOK.,"Its delicate white vans against the sky,"
4570,FOURTH BOOK.,"So soft and soundless, simply beautiful,—"
4571,FOURTH BOOK.,"Seen nearer ... what a roar and tear it makes,"
4572,FOURTH BOOK.,"How it grinds and bruises!... if she loves at last,"
4573,FOURTH BOOK.,"Her love’s a re-adjustment of self-love,"
4574,FOURTH BOOK.,No more; a need felt of another’s use
4575,FOURTH BOOK.,"To her one advantage,—as the mill wants grain,"
4576,FOURTH BOOK.,"The fire wants fuel, the very wolf wants prey;"
4577,FOURTH BOOK.,And none of these is more unscrupulous
4578,FOURTH BOOK.,Than such a charming woman when she loves.
4579,FOURTH BOOK.,She’ll not be thwarted by an obstacle
4580,FOURTH BOOK.,"So trifling as ... her soul is, ... much less yours!—"
4581,FOURTH BOOK.,"Is God a consideration?—she loves _you_,"
4582,FOURTH BOOK.,Not God; she will not flinch for Him indeed:
4583,FOURTH BOOK.,"She did not for the Marchioness of Perth,"
4584,FOURTH BOOK.,When wanting tickets for the birthnight-ball.
4585,FOURTH BOOK.,"She loves you, sir, with passion, to lunacy;"
4586,FOURTH BOOK.,She loves you like her diamonds ... almost.
4587,FOURTH BOOK.,"Well,"
4588,FOURTH BOOK.,"A month passed so, and then the notice came;"
4589,FOURTH BOOK.,On such a day the marriage at the church.
4590,FOURTH BOOK.,I was not backward.
4591,FOURTH BOOK.,Half St. Giles in frieze
4592,FOURTH BOOK.,"Was bidden to meet St. James in cloth of gold,"
4593,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, after contract at the altar, pass"
4594,FOURTH BOOK.,To eat a marriage-feast on Hampstead Heath.
4595,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of course the people came in uncompelled,"
4596,FOURTH BOOK.,"Lame, blind, and worse—sick, sorrowful, and worse,"
4597,FOURTH BOOK.,The humours of the peccant social wound
4598,FOURTH BOOK.,"All pressed out, poured out upon Pimlico,"
4599,FOURTH BOOK.,Exasperating the unaccustomed air
4600,FOURTH BOOK.,With hideous interfusion: you’d suppose
4601,FOURTH BOOK.,"A finished generation, dead of plague,"
4602,FOURTH BOOK.,"Swept outward from their graves into the sun,"
4603,FOURTH BOOK.,The moil of death upon them. What a sight!
4604,FOURTH BOOK.,A holiday of miserable men
4605,FOURTH BOOK.,Is sadder than a burial-day of kings.
4606,FOURTH BOOK.,
4607,FOURTH BOOK.,"They clogged the streets, they oozed into the church"
4608,FOURTH BOOK.,"In a dark slow stream, like blood. To see that sight,"
4609,FOURTH BOOK.,"The noble ladies stood up in their pews,"
4610,FOURTH BOOK.,"Some pale for fear, a few as red for hate,"
4611,FOURTH BOOK.,"Some simply curious, some just insolent,"
4612,FOURTH BOOK.,"And some in wondering scorn,—‘What next? what next?’"
4613,FOURTH BOOK.,These crushed their delicate rose-lips from the smile
4614,FOURTH BOOK.,"That misbecame them in a holy place,"
4615,FOURTH BOOK.,With broidered hems of perfumed handkerchiefs;
4616,FOURTH BOOK.,Those passed the salts with confidence of eyes
4617,FOURTH BOOK.,And simultaneous shiver of moiré silk;
4618,FOURTH BOOK.,"While all the aisles, alive and black with heads,"
4619,FOURTH BOOK.,"Crawled slowly toward the altar from the street,"
4620,FOURTH BOOK.,As bruised snakes crawl and hiss out of a hole
4621,FOURTH BOOK.,"With shuddering involutions, swaying slow"
4622,FOURTH BOOK.,"From right to left, and then from left to right,"
4623,FOURTH BOOK.,In pants and pauses. What an ugly crest
4624,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of faces, rose upon you everywhere,"
4625,FOURTH BOOK.,From that crammed mass! you did not usually
4626,FOURTH BOOK.,See faces like them in the open day:
4627,FOURTH BOOK.,"They hide in cellars, not to make you mad"
4628,FOURTH BOOK.,"As Romney Leigh is.—Faces!—O my God,"
4629,FOURTH BOOK.,"We call those, faces? men’s and women’s ... ay,"
4630,FOURTH BOOK.,"And children’s;—babies, hanging like a rag"
4631,FOURTH BOOK.,"Forgotten on their mother’s neck,—poor mouths,"
4632,FOURTH BOOK.,"Wiped clean of mother’s milk by mother’s blow,"
4633,FOURTH BOOK.,"Before they are taught her cursing. Faces!... phew,"
4634,FOURTH BOOK.,"We’ll call them vices festering to despairs,"
4635,FOURTH BOOK.,Or sorrows petrifying to vices: not
4636,FOURTH BOOK.,A finger-touch of God left whole on them;
4637,FOURTH BOOK.,"All ruined, lost—the countenance worn out"
4638,FOURTH BOOK.,"As the garments, the will dissolute as the acts,"
4639,FOURTH BOOK.,The passions loose and draggling in the dirt
4640,FOURTH BOOK.,To trip the foot up at the first free step!—
4641,FOURTH BOOK.,"Those, faces! ’twas as if you had stirred up hell"
4642,FOURTH BOOK.,To heave its lowest dreg-fiends uppermost
4643,FOURTH BOOK.,"In fiery swirls of slime,—such strangled fronts,"
4644,FOURTH BOOK.,"Such obdurate jaws were thrown up constantly,"
4645,FOURTH BOOK.,"To twit you with your race, corrupt your blood,"
4646,FOURTH BOOK.,And grind to devilish colours all your dreams
4647,FOURTH BOOK.,"Henceforth, ... though, haply, you should drop asleep"
4648,FOURTH BOOK.,"By clink of silver waters, in a muse"
4649,FOURTH BOOK.,On Raffael’s mild Madonna of the Bird.
4650,FOURTH BOOK.,
4651,FOURTH BOOK.,I’ve waked and slept through many nights and days
4652,FOURTH BOOK.,"Since then,—but still that day will catch my breath"
4653,FOURTH BOOK.,"Like a nightmare. There are fatal days, indeed,"
4654,FOURTH BOOK.,In which the fibrous years have taken root
4655,FOURTH BOOK.,"So deeply, that they quiver to their tops"
4656,FOURTH BOOK.,Whene’er you stir the dust of such a day.
4657,FOURTH BOOK.,
4658,FOURTH BOOK.,"My cousin met me with his eyes and hand,"
4659,FOURTH BOOK.,"And then, with just a word, ... that ‘Marian Erle"
4660,FOURTH BOOK.,"Was coming with her bridesmaids presently,’"
4661,FOURTH BOOK.,"Made haste to place me by the altar-stair,"
4662,FOURTH BOOK.,Where he and other noble gentlemen
4663,FOURTH BOOK.,"And high-born ladies, waited for the bride."
4664,FOURTH BOOK.,
4665,FOURTH BOOK.,We waited. It was early: there was time
4666,FOURTH BOOK.,"For greeting, and the morning’s compliment;"
4667,FOURTH BOOK.,And gradually a ripple of women’s talk
4668,FOURTH BOOK.,"Arose and fell, and tossed about a spray"
4669,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of English _s_s, soft as a silent hush,"
4670,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, notwithstanding, quite as audible"
4671,FOURTH BOOK.,As louder phrases thrown out by the men.
4672,FOURTH BOOK.,"—‘Yes, really, if we’ve need to wait in church,"
4673,FOURTH BOOK.,"We’ve need to talk there.’—‘She? ’Tis Lady Ayr,"
4674,FOURTH BOOK.,In blue—not purple! that’s the dowager.’
4675,FOURTH BOOK.,"—‘She looks as young.’—‘She flirts as young, you mean!"
4676,FOURTH BOOK.,"Why if you had seen her upon Thursday night,"
4677,FOURTH BOOK.,You’d call Miss Norris modest.’—‘_You_ again!
4678,FOURTH BOOK.,"I waltzed with you three hours back. Up at six,"
4679,FOURTH BOOK.,Up still at ten: scarce time to change one’s shoes.
4680,FOURTH BOOK.,"I feel as white and sulky as a ghost,"
4681,FOURTH BOOK.,"So pray don’t speak to me, Lord Belcher.’—‘No,"
4682,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’ll look at you instead, and it’s enough"
4683,FOURTH BOOK.,"While you have that face.’ ‘In church, my lord! fie, fie!’"
4684,FOURTH BOOK.,"—‘Adair, you stayed for the Division?’—‘Lost"
4685,FOURTH BOOK.,By one.’ ‘The devil it is! I’m sorry for’t.
4686,FOURTH BOOK.,And if I had not promised Mistress Grove’ ...
4687,FOURTH BOOK.,—‘You might have kept your word to Liverpool.’
4688,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Constituents must remember, after all,"
4689,FOURTH BOOK.,"We’re mortal.’—‘We remind them of it.’—‘Hark,"
4690,FOURTH BOOK.,"The bride comes! Here she comes, in a stream of milk!’"
4691,FOURTH BOOK.,"—‘There? Dear, you are asleep still; don’t you know"
4692,FOURTH BOOK.,The five Miss Granvilles? always dressed in white
4693,FOURTH BOOK.,To show they’re ready to be married.’—‘Lower!
4694,FOURTH BOOK.,"The aunt is at your elbow.’—‘Lady Maud,"
4695,FOURTH BOOK.,Did Lady Waldemar tell you she had seen
4696,FOURTH BOOK.,"This girl of Leigh’s?’ ‘No,—wait! ’twas Mrs. Brookes,"
4697,FOURTH BOOK.,Who told me Lady Waldemar told her—
4698,FOURTH BOOK.,"No, ’twasn’t Mrs. Brookes.’—‘She’s pretty?’—‘Who?"
4699,FOURTH BOOK.,Mrs. Brookes? Lady Waldemar?’—‘How hot!
4700,FOURTH BOOK.,Pray is’t the law to-day we’re not to breathe?
4701,FOURTH BOOK.,"You’re treading on my shawl—I thank you, sir.’"
4702,FOURTH BOOK.,"—‘They say the bride’s a mere child, who can’t read,"
4703,FOURTH BOOK.,"But knows the things she shouldn’t, with wide-awake"
4704,FOURTH BOOK.,Great eyes. I’d go through fire to look at her.’
4705,FOURTH BOOK.,"—‘You do, I think.’—‘And Lady Waldemar"
4706,FOURTH BOOK.,(You see her; sitting close to Romney Leigh;
4707,FOURTH BOOK.,"How beautiful she looks, a little flushed!)"
4708,FOURTH BOOK.,"Has taken up the girl, and organised"
4709,FOURTH BOOK.,"Leigh’s folly. Should I have come here, you suppose,"
4710,FOURTH BOOK.,Except she’d asked me?’—‘She’d have served him more
4711,FOURTH BOOK.,By marrying him herself.’
4712,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Ah—there she comes,"
4713,FOURTH BOOK.,"The bride, at last!’"
4714,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Indeed, no. Past eleven."
4715,FOURTH BOOK.,She puts off her patched petticoat to-day
4716,FOURTH BOOK.,"And puts on May-fair manners, so begins"
4717,FOURTH BOOK.,"By setting us to wait.’—‘Yes, yes, this Leigh"
4718,FOURTH BOOK.,"Was always odd; it’s in the blood, I think;"
4719,FOURTH BOOK.,His father’s uncle’s cousin’s second son
4720,FOURTH BOOK.,"Was, was ... you understand me—and for him,"
4721,FOURTH BOOK.,He’s stark!—has turned quite lunatic upon
4722,FOURTH BOOK.,This modern question of the poor—the poor:
4723,FOURTH BOOK.,An excellent subject when you’re moderate;
4724,FOURTH BOOK.,You’ve seen Prince Albert’s model lodging-house?
4725,FOURTH BOOK.,Does honour to his Royal Highness. Good!
4726,FOURTH BOOK.,But would he stop his carriage in Cheapside
4727,FOURTH BOOK.,To shake a common fellow by the fist
4728,FOURTH BOOK.,"Whose name was ... Shakspeare? no. We draw a line,"
4729,FOURTH BOOK.,"And if we stand not by our order, we"
4730,FOURTH BOOK.,"In England, we fall headlong. Here’s a sight,—"
4731,FOURTH BOOK.,"A hideous sight, a most indecent sight!"
4732,FOURTH BOOK.,"My wife would come, sir, or I had kept her back."
4733,FOURTH BOOK.,"By heaven, sir, when poor Damiens’ trunk and limbs"
4734,FOURTH BOOK.,"Were torn by horses, women of the court"
4735,FOURTH BOOK.,"Stood by and stared, exactly as to-day"
4736,FOURTH BOOK.,"On this dismembering of society,"
4737,FOURTH BOOK.,With pretty troubled faces.’
4738,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Now, at last."
4739,FOURTH BOOK.,She comes now.’
4740,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Where? who sees? you push me, sir,"
4741,FOURTH BOOK.,Beyond the point of what is mannerly.
4742,FOURTH BOOK.,"You’re standing, madam, on my second flounce—"
4743,FOURTH BOOK.,I do beseech you.’
4744,FOURTH BOOK.,‘No—it’s not the bride.
4745,FOURTH BOOK.,"Half-past eleven. How late. The bridegroom, mark,"
4746,FOURTH BOOK.,Gets anxious and goes out.’
4747,FOURTH BOOK.,‘And as I said ...
4748,FOURTH BOOK.,These Leighs! our best blood running in the rut!
4749,FOURTH BOOK.,It’s something awful. We had pardoned him
4750,FOURTH BOOK.,"A simple misalliance, got up aside"
4751,FOURTH BOOK.,For a pair of sky-blue eyes; our House of Lords
4752,FOURTH BOOK.,"Has winked at such things, and we’ve all been young."
4753,FOURTH BOOK.,"But here’s an inter-marriage reasoned out,"
4754,FOURTH BOOK.,"A contract (carried boldly to the light,"
4755,FOURTH BOOK.,"To challenge observation, pioneer"
4756,FOURTH BOOK.,Good acts by a great example) ’twixt the extremes
4757,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of martyrised society,—on the left,"
4758,FOURTH BOOK.,"The well-born,—on the right, the merest mob,"
4759,FOURTH BOOK.,To treat as equals!—’tis anarchical!
4760,FOURTH BOOK.,It means more than it says—’tis damnable!
4761,FOURTH BOOK.,"Why, sir, we can’t have even our coffee good,"
4762,FOURTH BOOK.,Unless we strain it.’
4763,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Here, Miss Leigh!’"
4764,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Lord Howe,"
4765,FOURTH BOOK.,You’re Romney’s friend. What’s all this waiting for?’
4766,FOURTH BOOK.,
4767,FOURTH BOOK.,‘I cannot tell. The bride has lost her head
4768,FOURTH BOOK.,"(And way, perhaps!) to prove her sympathy"
4769,FOURTH BOOK.,With the bridegroom.’
4770,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘What,—you also, disapprove!’"
4771,FOURTH BOOK.,
4772,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Oh, _I_ approve of nothing in the world,’"
4773,FOURTH BOOK.,"He answered; ‘not of you, still less of me,"
4774,FOURTH BOOK.,Nor even of Romney—though he’s worth us both.
4775,FOURTH BOOK.,We’re all gone wrong. The tune in us is lost:
4776,FOURTH BOOK.,"And whistling in back alleys to the moon,"
4777,FOURTH BOOK.,Will never catch it.’
4778,FOURTH BOOK.,Let me draw Lord Howe;
4779,FOURTH BOOK.,"A born aristocrat, bred radical,"
4780,FOURTH BOOK.,"And educated socialist, who still"
4781,FOURTH BOOK.,"Goes floating, on traditions of his kind,"
4782,FOURTH BOOK.,"Across the theoretic flood from France,—"
4783,FOURTH BOOK.,"Though, like a drenched Noah on a rotten deck,"
4784,FOURTH BOOK.,"Scarce safer for his place there. He, at least,"
4785,FOURTH BOOK.,"Will never land on Ararat, he knows,"
4786,FOURTH BOOK.,To recommence the world on the old plan:
4787,FOURTH BOOK.,"Indeed, he thinks, said world had better end;"
4788,FOURTH BOOK.,He sympathises rather with the fish
4789,FOURTH BOOK.,"Outside, than with the drowned paired beasts within"
4790,FOURTH BOOK.,Who cannot couple again or multiply:
4791,FOURTH BOOK.,"And that’s the sort of Noah he is, Lord Howe."
4792,FOURTH BOOK.,"He never could be anything complete,"
4793,FOURTH BOOK.,"Except a loyal, upright gentleman,"
4794,FOURTH BOOK.,"A liberal landlord, graceful diner-out,"
4795,FOURTH BOOK.,"And entertainer more than hospitable,"
4796,FOURTH BOOK.,Whom authors dine with and forget the port.
4797,FOURTH BOOK.,"Whatever he believes, and it is much,"
4798,FOURTH BOOK.,"But no-wise certain ... now here and now there, ..."
4799,FOURTH BOOK.,"He still has sympathies beyond his creed,"
4800,FOURTH BOOK.,"Diverting him from action. In the House,"
4801,FOURTH BOOK.,"No party counts upon him, and all praise"
4802,FOURTH BOOK.,"All like his books too, (he has written books)"
4803,FOURTH BOOK.,"Which, good to lie beside a bishop’s chair,"
4804,FOURTH BOOK.,So oft outreach themselves with jets of fire
4805,FOURTH BOOK.,At which the foremost of the progressists
4806,FOURTH BOOK.,May warm audacious hands in passing by.
4807,FOURTH BOOK.,"—Of stature over-tall, lounging for ease;"
4808,FOURTH BOOK.,"Light hair, that seems to carry a wind in it,"
4809,FOURTH BOOK.,"And eyes that, when they look on you, will lean"
4810,FOURTH BOOK.,"Their whole weight half in indolence, and half"
4811,FOURTH BOOK.,"In wishing you unmitigated good,"
4812,FOURTH BOOK.,Until you know not if to flinch from him
4813,FOURTH BOOK.,Or thank him.—’Tis Lord Howe.
4814,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘We’re all gone wrong,’"
4815,FOURTH BOOK.,"Said he, ‘and Romney, that dear friend of ours,"
4816,FOURTH BOOK.,Is no-wise right. There’s one true thing on earth;
4817,FOURTH BOOK.,"That’s love! He takes it up, and dresses it,"
4818,FOURTH BOOK.,"And acts a play with it, as Hamlet did,"
4819,FOURTH BOOK.,"To show what cruel uncles we have been,"
4820,FOURTH BOOK.,"And how we should be uneasy in our minds,"
4821,FOURTH BOOK.,"While he, Prince Hamlet, weds a pretty maid"
4822,FOURTH BOOK.,"(Who keeps us too long waiting, we’ll confess)"
4823,FOURTH BOOK.,"By symbol, to instruct us formally"
4824,FOURTH BOOK.,"To fill the ditches up ’twixt class and class,"
4825,FOURTH BOOK.,And live together in phalansteries.
4826,FOURTH BOOK.,"What then?—he’s mad, our Hamlet! clap his play,"
4827,FOURTH BOOK.,And bind him.’
4828,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Ah Lord Howe, this spectacle"
4829,FOURTH BOOK.,Pulls stronger at us than the Dane’s. See there!
4830,FOURTH BOOK.,The crammed aisles heave and strain and steam with life—
4831,FOURTH BOOK.,"Dear Heaven, what life!’"
4832,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Why, yes,—a poet sees;"
4833,FOURTH BOOK.,Which makes him different from a common man.
4834,FOURTH BOOK.,"_I_, too, see somewhat, though I cannot sing;"
4835,FOURTH BOOK.,"I should have been a poet, only that"
4836,FOURTH BOOK.,"My mother took fright at the ugly world,"
4837,FOURTH BOOK.,And bore me tongue-tied. If you’ll grant me now
4838,FOURTH BOOK.,That Romney gives us a fine actor-piece
4839,FOURTH BOOK.,"To make us merry on his marriage-morn,"
4840,FOURTH BOOK.,"The fable’s worse than Hamlet’s, I’ll concede."
4841,FOURTH BOOK.,"The terrible people, old and poor and blind,"
4842,FOURTH BOOK.,Their eyes eat out with plague and poverty
4843,FOURTH BOOK.,"From seeing beautiful and cheerful sights,"
4844,FOURTH BOOK.,"We’ll liken to a brutalised King Lear,"
4845,FOURTH BOOK.,"Led out,—by no means to clear scores with wrongs—"
4846,FOURTH BOOK.,"His wrongs are so far back, ... he has forgot;"
4847,FOURTH BOOK.,All’s past like youth; but just to witness here
4848,FOURTH BOOK.,"A simple contract,—he, upon his side,"
4849,FOURTH BOOK.,And Regan with her sister Goneril
4850,FOURTH BOOK.,"And all the dappled courtiers and court-fools,"
4851,FOURTH BOOK.,On their side. Not that any of these would say
4852,FOURTH BOOK.,"They’re sorry, neither. What is done, is done,"
4853,FOURTH BOOK.,"And violence is now turned privilege,"
4854,FOURTH BOOK.,"As cream turns cheese, if buried long enough."
4855,FOURTH BOOK.,What could such lovely ladies have to do
4856,FOURTH BOOK.,"With the old man there, in those ill-odorous rags,"
4857,FOURTH BOOK.,Except to keep the wind-side of him? Lear
4858,FOURTH BOOK.,"Is flat and quiet, as a decent grave;"
4859,FOURTH BOOK.,He does not curse his daughters in the least.
4860,FOURTH BOOK.,_Be_ these his daughters? Lear is thinking of
4861,FOURTH BOOK.,His porridge chiefly ... is it getting cold
4862,FOURTH BOOK.,At Hampstead? will the ale be served in pots?
4863,FOURTH BOOK.,"Poor Lear, poor daughters! Bravo, Romney’s play!’"
4864,FOURTH BOOK.,
4865,FOURTH BOOK.,A murmur and a movement drew around;
4866,FOURTH BOOK.,A naked whisper touched us. Something wrong!
4867,FOURTH BOOK.,"What’s wrong? The black crowd, as an overstrained"
4868,FOURTH BOOK.,"Cord, quivered in vibrations, and I saw ..."
4869,FOURTH BOOK.,Was that _his_ face I saw?... his ... Romney Leigh’s ...
4870,FOURTH BOOK.,Which tossed a sudden horror like a sponge
4871,FOURTH BOOK.,"Into all eyes,—while himself stood white upon"
4872,FOURTH BOOK.,"The topmost altar-stair, and tried to speak,"
4873,FOURTH BOOK.,"And failed, and lifted higher above his head"
4874,FOURTH BOOK.,"A letter, ... as a man who drowns and gasps."
4875,FOURTH BOOK.,
4876,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘My brothers, bear with me! I am very weak."
4877,FOURTH BOOK.,I meant but only good. Perhaps I meant
4878,FOURTH BOOK.,"Too proudly,—and God snatched the circumstance"
4879,FOURTH BOOK.,And changed it therefore. There’s no marriage—none.
4880,FOURTH BOOK.,"She leaves me,—she departs,—she disappears,—"
4881,FOURTH BOOK.,"I lose her. Yet I never forced her ‘ay,’"
4882,FOURTH BOOK.,"To have her ‘no’ so cast into my teeth,"
4883,FOURTH BOOK.,"In manner of an accusation, thus."
4884,FOURTH BOOK.,"My friends, you are all dismissed. Go, eat and drink"
4885,FOURTH BOOK.,"According to the programme,—and farewell!’"
4886,FOURTH BOOK.,
4887,FOURTH BOOK.,He ended. There was silence in the church;
4888,FOURTH BOOK.,We heard a baby sucking in its sleep
4889,FOURTH BOOK.,"At the farthest end of the aisle. Then spoke a man,"
4890,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Now, look to it, coves, that all the beef and drink"
4891,FOURTH BOOK.,Be not filched from us like the other fun;
4892,FOURTH BOOK.,For beer’s spilt easier than a woman is!
4893,FOURTH BOOK.,This gentry is not honest with the poor;
4894,FOURTH BOOK.,"They bring us up, to trick us.’—‘Go it, Jim,’"
4895,FOURTH BOOK.,"A woman screamed back,—‘I’m a tender soul;"
4896,FOURTH BOOK.,I never banged a child at two years old
4897,FOURTH BOOK.,"And drew blood from him, but I sobbed for it"
4898,FOURTH BOOK.,"Next moment,—and I’ve had a plague of seven."
4899,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’m tender; I’ve no stomach even for beef,"
4900,FOURTH BOOK.,"Until I know about the girl that’s lost,"
4901,FOURTH BOOK.,"That’s killed, mayhap. I did misdoubt, at first,"
4902,FOURTH BOOK.,"The fine lord meant no good by her, or us."
4903,FOURTH BOOK.,"He, maybe, got the upper hand of her"
4904,FOURTH BOOK.,"By holding up a wedding-ring, and then ..."
4905,FOURTH BOOK.,"A choking finger on her throat, last night,"
4906,FOURTH BOOK.,"And just a clever tale to keep us still,"
4907,FOURTH BOOK.,"As she is, poor lost innocent. ‘Disappear!’"
4908,FOURTH BOOK.,Who ever disappears except a ghost?
4909,FOURTH BOOK.,And who believes a story of a ghost?
4910,FOURTH BOOK.,"I ask you,—would a girl go off, instead"
4911,FOURTH BOOK.,Of staying to be married? a fine tale!
4912,FOURTH BOOK.,"A wicked man, I say, a wicked man!"
4913,FOURTH BOOK.,For my part I would rather starve on gin
4914,FOURTH BOOK.,Than make my dinner on his beef and beer.’—
4915,FOURTH BOOK.,At which a cry rose up—‘We’ll have our rights.
4916,FOURTH BOOK.,"We’ll have the girl, the girl! Your ladies there"
4917,FOURTH BOOK.,"Are married safely and smoothly every day,"
4918,FOURTH BOOK.,And _she_ shall not drop through into a trap
4919,FOURTH BOOK.,Because she’s poor and of the people: shame!
4920,FOURTH BOOK.,We’ll have no tricks played off by gentlefolks;
4921,FOURTH BOOK.,We’ll see her righted.’
4922,FOURTH BOOK.,Through the rage and roar
4923,FOURTH BOOK.,I heard the broken words which Romney flung
4924,FOURTH BOOK.,"Among the turbulent masses, from the ground"
4925,FOURTH BOOK.,"He held still, with his masterful pale face—"
4926,FOURTH BOOK.,"As huntsmen throw the ration to the pack,"
4927,FOURTH BOOK.,"Who, falling on it headlong, dog on dog"
4928,FOURTH BOOK.,"In heaps of fury, rend it, swallow it up"
4929,FOURTH BOOK.,"With yelling hound-jaws,—his indignant words,"
4930,FOURTH BOOK.,"His piteous words, his most pathetic words,"
4931,FOURTH BOOK.,Whereof I caught the meaning here and there
4932,FOURTH BOOK.,"By his gesture ... torn in morsels, yelled across,"
4933,FOURTH BOOK.,"And so devoured. From end to end, the church"
4934,FOURTH BOOK.,"Rocked round us like the sea in storm, and then"
4935,FOURTH BOOK.,Broke up like the earth in earthquake. Men cried out
4936,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Police’—and women stood and shrieked for God,"
4937,FOURTH BOOK.,"Or dropt and swooned; or, like a herd of deer,"
4938,FOURTH BOOK.,"(For whom the black woods suddenly grow alive,"
4939,FOURTH BOOK.,Unleashing their wild shadows down the wind
4940,FOURTH BOOK.,"To hunt the creatures into corners, back"
4941,FOURTH BOOK.,"And forward) madly fled, or blindly fell,"
4942,FOURTH BOOK.,Trod screeching underneath the feet of those
4943,FOURTH BOOK.,Who fled and screeched.
4944,FOURTH BOOK.,The last sight left to me
4945,FOURTH BOOK.,Was Romney’s terrible calm face above
4946,FOURTH BOOK.,The tumult!—the last sound was ‘Pull him down!
4947,FOURTH BOOK.,"Strike—kill him!’ Stretching my unreasoning arms,"
4948,FOURTH BOOK.,"As men in dreams, who vainly interpose"
4949,FOURTH BOOK.,"’Twixt gods and their undoing, with a cry"
4950,FOURTH BOOK.,I struggled to precipitate myself
4951,FOURTH BOOK.,Head-foremost to the rescue of my soul
4952,FOURTH BOOK.,"In that white face, ... till some one caught me back,"
4953,FOURTH BOOK.,"And so the world went out,—I felt no more."
4954,FOURTH BOOK.,
4955,FOURTH BOOK.,"What followed, was told after by Lord Howe,"
4956,FOURTH BOOK.,Who bore me senseless from the strangling crowd
4957,FOURTH BOOK.,"In church and street, and then returned alone"
4958,FOURTH BOOK.,To see the tumult quelled. The men of law
4959,FOURTH BOOK.,"Had fallen as thunder on a roaring fire,"
4960,FOURTH BOOK.,"And made all silent,—while the people’s smoke"
4961,FOURTH BOOK.,Passed eddying slowly from the emptied aisles.
4962,FOURTH BOOK.,
4963,FOURTH BOOK.,"Here’s Marian’s letter, which a ragged child"
4964,FOURTH BOOK.,"Brought running, just as Romney at the porch"
4965,FOURTH BOOK.,Looked out expectant of the bride. He sent
4966,FOURTH BOOK.,The letter to me by his friend Lord Howe
4967,FOURTH BOOK.,"Some two hours after, folded in a sheet"
4968,FOURTH BOOK.,On which his well-known hand had left a word.
4969,FOURTH BOOK.,Here’s Marian’s letter.
4970,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Noble friend, dear saint,"
4971,FOURTH BOOK.,"Be patient with me. Never think me vile,"
4972,FOURTH BOOK.,Who might to-morrow morning be your wife
4973,FOURTH BOOK.,But that I loved you more than such a name.
4974,FOURTH BOOK.,"Farewell, my Romney. Let me write it once,—"
4975,FOURTH BOOK.,My Romney.
4976,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘’Tis so pretty a coupled word,"
4977,FOURTH BOOK.,I have no heart to pluck it with a blot.
4978,FOURTH BOOK.,"We say ‘my God’ sometimes, upon our knees,"
4979,FOURTH BOOK.,Who is not therefore vexed: so bear with it ...
4980,FOURTH BOOK.,"And me. I know I’m foolish, weak, and vain;"
4981,FOURTH BOOK.,Yet most of all I’m angry with myself
4982,FOURTH BOOK.,"For losing your last footstep on the stair,"
4983,FOURTH BOOK.,"That last time of your coming,—yesterday!"
4984,FOURTH BOOK.,"The very first time I lost step of yours,"
4985,FOURTH BOOK.,(Its sweetness comes the next to what you speak)
4986,FOURTH BOOK.,"But yesterday sobs took me by the throat,"
4987,FOURTH BOOK.,And cut me off from music.
4988,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Mister Leigh,"
4989,FOURTH BOOK.,You’ll set me down as wrong in many things.
4990,FOURTH BOOK.,"You’ve praised me, sir, for truth,—and now you’ll learn"
4991,FOURTH BOOK.,I had not courage to be rightly true.
4992,FOURTH BOOK.,"I once began to tell you how she came,"
4993,FOURTH BOOK.,The woman ... and you stared upon the floor
4994,FOURTH BOOK.,In one of your fixed thoughts ... which put me out
4995,FOURTH BOOK.,"For that day. After, some one spoke of me,"
4996,FOURTH BOOK.,"So wisely, and of you, so tenderly,"
4997,FOURTH BOOK.,Persuading me to silence for your sake ...
4998,FOURTH BOOK.,"Well, well! it seems this moment I was wrong"
4999,FOURTH BOOK.,In keeping back from telling you the truth:
5000,FOURTH BOOK.,"There might be truth betwixt us two, at least,"
5001,FOURTH BOOK.,If nothing else. And yet ’twas dangerous.
5002,FOURTH BOOK.,Suppose a real angel came from heaven
5003,FOURTH BOOK.,"To live with men and women! he’d go mad,"
5004,FOURTH BOOK.,If no considerate hand should tie a blind
5005,FOURTH BOOK.,Across his piercing eyes. ’Tis thus with you:
5006,FOURTH BOOK.,You see us too much in your heavenly light;
5007,FOURTH BOOK.,"I always thought so, angel,—and indeed"
5008,FOURTH BOOK.,There’s danger that you beat yourself to death
5009,FOURTH BOOK.,"Against the edges of this alien world,"
5010,FOURTH BOOK.,In some divine and fluttering pity.
5011,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Yes,"
5012,FOURTH BOOK.,"It would be dreadful for a friend of yours,"
5013,FOURTH BOOK.,To see all England thrust you out of doors
5014,FOURTH BOOK.,"And mock you from the windows. You might say,"
5015,FOURTH BOOK.,"Or think (that’s worse), ‘There’s some one in the house"
5016,FOURTH BOOK.,I miss and love still.’ Dreadful!
5017,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Very kind,"
5018,FOURTH BOOK.,"I pray you mark, was Lady Waldemar."
5019,FOURTH BOOK.,"She came to see me nine times, rather ten—"
5020,FOURTH BOOK.,"So beautiful, she hurts me like the day"
5021,FOURTH BOOK.,Let suddenly on sick eyes.
5022,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Most kind of all,"
5023,FOURTH BOOK.,"Your cousin!—ah, most like you! Ere you came"
5024,FOURTH BOOK.,She kissed me mouth to mouth: I felt her soul
5025,FOURTH BOOK.,Dip through her serious lips in holy fire.
5026,FOURTH BOOK.,"God help me, but it made me arrogant;"
5027,FOURTH BOOK.,I almost told her that you would not lose
5028,FOURTH BOOK.,"By taking me to wife: though, ever since,"
5029,FOURTH BOOK.,I’ve pondered much a certain thing she asked ...
5030,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘He loves you, Marian?’ ... in a sort of mild"
5031,FOURTH BOOK.,Derisive sadness ... as a mother asks
5032,FOURTH BOOK.,"Her babe, ‘You’ll touch that star, you think?’"
5033,FOURTH BOOK.,‘Farewell!
5034,FOURTH BOOK.,I know I never touched it.
5035,FOURTH BOOK.,This is worst:
5036,FOURTH BOOK.,"Babes grow, and lose the hope of things above;"
5037,FOURTH BOOK.,A silver threepence sets them leaping high—
5038,FOURTH BOOK.,But no more stars! mark that.
5039,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’ve writ all night,"
5040,FOURTH BOOK.,"And told you nothing. God, if I could die,"
5041,FOURTH BOOK.,And let this letter break off innocent
5042,FOURTH BOOK.,Just here! But no—for your sake ...
5043,FOURTH BOOK.,Here’s the last:
5044,FOURTH BOOK.,"I never could be happy as your wife,"
5045,FOURTH BOOK.,"I never could be harmless as your friend,"
5046,FOURTH BOOK.,"I never will look more into your face,"
5047,FOURTH BOOK.,"Till God says, ‘Look!’ I charge you, seek me not,"
5048,FOURTH BOOK.,Nor vex yourself with lamentable thoughts
5049,FOURTH BOOK.,That peradventure I have come to grief;
5050,FOURTH BOOK.,"Be sure I’m well, I’m merry, I’m at ease,"
5051,FOURTH BOOK.,"But such a long way, long way, long way off,"
5052,FOURTH BOOK.,"I think you’ll find me sooner in my grave,"
5053,FOURTH BOOK.,"And that’s my choice, observe. For what remains,"
5054,FOURTH BOOK.,"An over-generous friend will care for me,"
5055,FOURTH BOOK.,And keep me happy ... happier....
5056,FOURTH BOOK.,There’s a blot!
5057,FOURTH BOOK.,This ink runs thick ... we light girls lightly weep ...
5058,FOURTH BOOK.,"And keep me happier ... was the thing to say, ..."
5059,FOURTH BOOK.,"Than as your wife I could be!—O, my star,"
5060,FOURTH BOOK.,"My saint, my soul! for surely you’re my soul,"
5061,FOURTH BOOK.,Through whom God touched me! I am not so lost
5062,FOURTH BOOK.,"I cannot thank you for the good you did,"
5063,FOURTH BOOK.,"The tears you stopped, which fell down bitterly,"
5064,FOURTH BOOK.,Like these—the times you made me weep for joy
5065,FOURTH BOOK.,At hoping I should learn to write your notes
5066,FOURTH BOOK.,"And save the tiring of your eyes, at night;"
5067,FOURTH BOOK.,And most for that sweet thrice you kissed my lips
5068,FOURTH BOOK.,And said ‘Dear Marian.’
5069,FOURTH BOOK.,"’Twould be hard to read,"
5070,FOURTH BOOK.,"This letter, for a reader half as learn’d,"
5071,FOURTH BOOK.,"But you’ll be sure to master it, in spite"
5072,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of ups and downs. My hand shakes, I am blind,"
5073,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’m poor at writing, at the best,—and yet"
5074,FOURTH BOOK.,I tried to make my _g_s the way you showed.
5075,FOURTH BOOK.,Farewell—Christ love you.—Say ‘poor Marian’ now.’
5076,FOURTH BOOK.,
5077,FOURTH BOOK.,"Poor Marian!—wanton Marian!—was it so,"
5078,FOURTH BOOK.,"Or so? For days, her touching, foolish lines"
5079,FOURTH BOOK.,"We mused on with conjectural fantasy,"
5080,FOURTH BOOK.,As if some riddle of a summer-cloud
5081,FOURTH BOOK.,On which one tries unlike similitudes
5082,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of now a spotted Hydra-skin cast off,"
5083,FOURTH BOOK.,And now a screen of carven ivory
5084,FOURTH BOOK.,That shuts the heavens’ conventual secrets up
5085,FOURTH BOOK.,From mortals over-bold. We sought the sense:
5086,FOURTH BOOK.,"She loved him so perhaps, (such words mean love,)"
5087,FOURTH BOOK.,"That, worked on by some shrewd perfidious tongue,"
5088,FOURTH BOOK.,(And then I thought of Lady Waldemar)
5089,FOURTH BOOK.,"She left him, not to hurt him; or perhaps"
5090,FOURTH BOOK.,"She loved one in her class,—or did not love,"
5091,FOURTH BOOK.,"But mused upon her wild bad tramping life,"
5092,FOURTH BOOK.,"Until the free blood fluttered at her heart,"
5093,FOURTH BOOK.,And black bread eaten by the road-side hedge
5094,FOURTH BOOK.,Seemed sweeter than being put to Romney’s school
5095,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of philanthropical self-sacrifice,"
5096,FOURTH BOOK.,"Irrevocably.—Girls are girls, beside,"
5097,FOURTH BOOK.,"Thought I, and like a wedding by one rule."
5098,FOURTH BOOK.,"You seldom catch these birds, except with chaff:"
5099,FOURTH BOOK.,They feel it almost an immoral thing
5100,FOURTH BOOK.,"To go out and be married in broad day,"
5101,FOURTH BOOK.,Unless some winning special flattery should
5102,FOURTH BOOK.,"Excuse them to themselves for’t, ... ‘No one parts"
5103,FOURTH BOOK.,"Her hair with such a silver line as you,"
5104,FOURTH BOOK.,One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown!’
5105,FOURTH BOOK.,"Or else ... ‘You bite your lip in such a way,"
5106,FOURTH BOOK.,It spoils me for the smiling of the rest’—
5107,FOURTH BOOK.,"And so on. Then a worthless gaud or two,"
5108,FOURTH BOOK.,"To keep for love,—a ribbon for the neck,"
5109,FOURTH BOOK.,"Or some glass pin,—they have their weight with girls."
5110,FOURTH BOOK.,
5111,FOURTH BOOK.,And Romney sought her many days and weeks:
5112,FOURTH BOOK.,"He sifted all the refuse of the town,"
5113,FOURTH BOOK.,"Explored the trains, enquired among the ships,"
5114,FOURTH BOOK.,And felt the country through from end to end;
5115,FOURTH BOOK.,"No Marian!—Though I hinted what I knew,—"
5116,FOURTH BOOK.,A friend of his had reasons of her own
5117,FOURTH BOOK.,For throwing back the match—he would not hear:
5118,FOURTH BOOK.,"The lady had been ailing ever since,"
5119,FOURTH BOOK.,The shock had harmed her. Something in his tone
5120,FOURTH BOOK.,Repressed me; something in me shamed my doubt
5121,FOURTH BOOK.,"To a sigh, repressed too. He went on to say"
5122,FOURTH BOOK.,"That, putting questions where his Marian lodged,"
5123,FOURTH BOOK.,"He found she had received for visitors,"
5124,FOURTH BOOK.,Besides himself and Lady Waldemar
5125,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, that once, me—a dubious woman dressed"
5126,FOURTH BOOK.,Beyond us both. The rings upon her hands
5127,FOURTH BOOK.,Had dazed the children when she threw them pence;
5128,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘She wore her bonnet as the queen might hers,"
5129,FOURTH BOOK.,"To show the crown,’ they said,—‘a scarlet crown"
5130,FOURTH BOOK.,Of roses that had never been in bud.’
5131,FOURTH BOOK.,
5132,FOURTH BOOK.,"When Romney told me that,—for now and then"
5133,FOURTH BOOK.,"He came to tell me how the search advanced,"
5134,FOURTH BOOK.,His voice dropped: I bent forward for the rest:
5135,FOURTH BOOK.,"The woman had been with her, it appeared,"
5136,FOURTH BOOK.,"At first from week to week, then day by day,"
5137,FOURTH BOOK.,"And last, ’twas sure ..."
5138,FOURTH BOOK.,I looked upon the ground
5139,FOURTH BOOK.,"To escape the anguish of his eyes, and asked"
5140,FOURTH BOOK.,As low as when you speak to mourners new
5141,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of those they cannot bear yet to call dead,"
5142,FOURTH BOOK.,‘If Marian had as much as named to him
5143,FOURTH BOOK.,"A certain Rose, an early friend of hers,"
5144,FOURTH BOOK.,A ruined creature.’
5145,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Never,’—Starting up"
5146,FOURTH BOOK.,"He strode from side to side about the room,"
5147,FOURTH BOOK.,"Most like some prisoned lion sprung awake,"
5148,FOURTH BOOK.,Who has felt the desert sting him through his dreams.
5149,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘What was I to her, that she should tell me aught?"
5150,FOURTH BOOK.,A friend! was _I_ a friend? I see all clear.
5151,FOURTH BOOK.,"Such devils would pull angels out of heaven,"
5152,FOURTH BOOK.,Provided they could reach them; ’tis their pride;
5153,FOURTH BOOK.,And that’s the odds ’twixt soul and body-plague!
5154,FOURTH BOOK.,"The veriest slave who drops in Cairo’s street,"
5155,FOURTH BOOK.,"Cries, ‘Stand off from me,’ to the passengers;"
5156,FOURTH BOOK.,"While these blotched souls are eager to infect,"
5157,FOURTH BOOK.,And blow their bad breath in a sister’s face
5158,FOURTH BOOK.,As if they got some ease by it.’
5159,FOURTH BOOK.,I broke through.
5160,FOURTH BOOK.,‘Some natures catch no plagues. I’ve read of babes
5161,FOURTH BOOK.,Found whole and sleeping by the spotted breast
5162,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of one a full day dead. I hold it true,"
5163,FOURTH BOOK.,"As I’m a woman and know womanhood,"
5164,FOURTH BOOK.,"That Marian Erle, however lured from place,"
5165,FOURTH BOOK.,"Deceived in way, keeps pure in aim and heart,"
5166,FOURTH BOOK.,As snow that’s drifted from the garden-bank
5167,FOURTH BOOK.,To the open road.’
5168,FOURTH BOOK.,’Twas hard to hear him laugh.
5169,FOURTH BOOK.,‘The figure’s happy. Well—a dozen carts
5170,FOURTH BOOK.,And trampers will secure you presently
5171,FOURTH BOOK.,"A fine white snow-drift. Leave it there, your snow!"
5172,FOURTH BOOK.,’Twill pass for soot ere sunset. Pure in aim?
5173,FOURTH BOOK.,"She’s pure in aim, I grant you,—like myself,"
5174,FOURTH BOOK.,Who thought to take the world upon my back
5175,FOURTH BOOK.,"To carry it o’er a chasm of social ill,"
5176,FOURTH BOOK.,And end by letting slip through impotence
5177,FOURTH BOOK.,"A single soul, a child’s weight in a soul,"
5178,FOURTH BOOK.,"Straight down the pit of hell! yes, I and she"
5179,FOURTH BOOK.,Have reason to be proud of our pure aims.’
5180,FOURTH BOOK.,"Then softly, as the last repenting drops"
5181,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of a thunder-shower, he added, ‘The poor child;"
5182,FOURTH BOOK.,"Poor Marian! ’twas a luckless day for her,"
5183,FOURTH BOOK.,When first she chanced on my philanthropy.’
5184,FOURTH BOOK.,
5185,FOURTH BOOK.,"He drew a chair beside me, and sate down;"
5186,FOURTH BOOK.,"And I, instinctively, as women use"
5187,FOURTH BOOK.,"Before a sweet friend’s grief,—when, in his ear,"
5188,FOURTH BOOK.,"They hum the tune of comfort, though themselves"
5189,FOURTH BOOK.,"Most ignorant of the special words of such,"
5190,FOURTH BOOK.,And quiet so and fortify his brain
5191,FOURTH BOOK.,And give it time and strength for feeling out
5192,FOURTH BOOK.,"To reach the availing sense beyond that sound,—"
5193,FOURTH BOOK.,"Went murmuring to him, what, if written here,"
5194,FOURTH BOOK.,"Would seem not much, yet fetched him better help"
5195,FOURTH BOOK.,"Than, peradventure, if it had been more."
5196,FOURTH BOOK.,
5197,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’ve known the pregnant thinkers of this time,"
5198,FOURTH BOOK.,"And stood by breathless, hanging on their lips,"
5199,FOURTH BOOK.,When some chromatic sequence of fine thought
5200,FOURTH BOOK.,In learned modulation phrased itself
5201,FOURTH BOOK.,To an unconjectured harmony of truth.
5202,FOURTH BOOK.,"And yet I’ve been more moved, more raised, I say,"
5203,FOURTH BOOK.,"By a simple word ... a broken easy thing,"
5204,FOURTH BOOK.,"A three-years infant might say after you,—"
5205,FOURTH BOOK.,"A look, a sigh, a touch upon the palm,"
5206,FOURTH BOOK.,Which meant less than ‘I love you’ ... than by all
5207,FOURTH BOOK.,The full-voiced rhetoric of those master-mouths.
5208,FOURTH BOOK.,
5209,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Ah dear Aurora,’ he began at last,"
5210,FOURTH BOOK.,"His pale lips fumbling for a sort of smile,"
5211,FOURTH BOOK.,‘Your printer’s devils have not spoilt your heart:
5212,FOURTH BOOK.,"That’s well. And who knows but, long years ago,"
5213,FOURTH BOOK.,"When you and I talked, you were somewhat right"
5214,FOURTH BOOK.,"In being so peevish with me? You, at least,"
5215,FOURTH BOOK.,"Have ruined no one through your dreams! Instead,"
5216,FOURTH BOOK.,You’ve helped the facile youth to live youth’s day
5217,FOURTH BOOK.,"With innocent distraction, still perhaps"
5218,FOURTH BOOK.,Suggestive of things better than your rhymes.
5219,FOURTH BOOK.,"The little shepherd-maiden, eight years old,"
5220,FOURTH BOOK.,"I’ve seen upon the mountains of Vaucluse,"
5221,FOURTH BOOK.,"Asleep i’ the sun, her head upon her knees,"

5223,FOURTH BOOK.,"Than any sheep-dog trained imperfectly,"

5225,FOURTH BOOK.,‘I look
5226,FOURTH BOOK.,"As if I had slept, then?’"
5227,FOURTH BOOK.,He was touched at once
5228,FOURTH BOOK.,By something in my face. Indeed ’twas sure
5229,FOURTH BOOK.,"That he and I,—despite a year or two"
5230,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of younger life on my side, and on his,"
5231,FOURTH BOOK.,"The heaping of the years’ work on the days,—"
5232,FOURTH BOOK.,"The three-hour speeches from the member’s seat,"
5233,FOURTH BOOK.,"The hot committees, in and out the House,"
5234,FOURTH BOOK.,"The pamphlets, ‘Arguments,’ ‘Collective Views,’"
5235,FOURTH BOOK.,"Tossed out as straw before sick houses, just"
5236,FOURTH BOOK.,"To show one’s sick and so be trod to dirt,"
5237,FOURTH BOOK.,"And no more use,—through this world’s underground"
5238,FOURTH BOOK.,"The burrowing, groping effort, whence the arm"
5239,FOURTH BOOK.,"And heart come bleeding,—sure, that he and I"
5240,FOURTH BOOK.,"Were, after all, unequally fatigued!"
5241,FOURTH BOOK.,"That he, in his developed manhood, stood"
5242,FOURTH BOOK.,A little sunburnt by the glare of life;
5243,FOURTH BOOK.,"While I ... it seemed no sun had shone on me,"
5244,FOURTH BOOK.,So many seasons I had forgot my Springs;
5245,FOURTH BOOK.,"My cheeks had pined and perished from their orbs,"
5246,FOURTH BOOK.,And all the youth-blood in them had grown white
5247,FOURTH BOOK.,As dew on autumn cyclamens: alone
5248,FOURTH BOOK.,My eyes and forehead answered for my face.

5251,FOURTH BOOK.,
5252,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Not so, my cousin,—only not asleep!’"
5253,FOURTH BOOK.,"I answered, smiling gently. ‘Let it be."
5254,FOURTH BOOK.,You scarcely found the poet of Vaucluse
5255,FOURTH BOOK.,"As drowsy as the shepherds. What is art,"
5256,FOURTH BOOK.,"But life upon the larger scale, the higher,"
5257,FOURTH BOOK.,"When, graduating up in a spiral line"
5258,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of still expanding and ascending gyres,"
5259,FOURTH BOOK.,It pushes toward the intense significance
5260,FOURTH BOOK.,"Of all things, hungry for the Infinite?"
5261,FOURTH BOOK.,"Art’s life,—and where we live, we suffer and toil.’"
5262,FOURTH BOOK.,
5263,FOURTH BOOK.,He seemed to sift me with his painful eyes.
5264,FOURTH BOOK.,‘Alas! you take it gravely; you refuse
5265,FOURTH BOOK.,"Your dreamland, right of common, and green rest."
5266,FOURTH BOOK.,"You break the mythic turf where danced the nymphs,"
5267,FOURTH BOOK.,"With crooked ploughs of actual life,—let in"
5268,FOURTH BOOK.,"The axes to the legendary woods,"
5269,FOURTH BOOK.,To pay the head-tax. You are fallen indeed
5270,FOURTH BOOK.,"On evil days, you poets, if yourselves"
5271,FOURTH BOOK.,Can praise that art of yours no otherwise;
5272,FOURTH BOOK.,"And, if you cannot, ... better take a trade"

5274,FOURTH BOOK.,
5275,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Of use!’ I softly echoed, ‘there’s the point"
5276,FOURTH BOOK.,We sweep about for ever in argument;
5277,FOURTH BOOK.,"Like swallows, which the exasperate, dying year"
5278,FOURTH BOOK.,"Sets spinning in black circles, round and round,"
5279,FOURTH BOOK.,Preparing for far flights o’er unknown seas.
5280,FOURTH BOOK.,And we ... where tend we?’
5281,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Where?’ he said, and sighed."
5282,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘The whole creation, from the hour we are born,"
5283,FOURTH BOOK.,Perplexes us with questions. Not a stone
5284,FOURTH BOOK.,"But cries behind us, every weary step,"
5285,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Where, where?’ I leave stones to reply to stones."
5286,FOURTH BOOK.,Enough for me and for my fleshly heart
5287,FOURTH BOOK.,"To harken the invocations of my kind,"
5288,FOURTH BOOK.,When men catch hold upon my shuddering nerves
5289,FOURTH BOOK.,"And shriek, ‘What help? what hope? what bread i’ the house,"
5290,FOURTH BOOK.,"What fire i’ the frost?’ There must be some response,"
5291,FOURTH BOOK.,"Though mine fail utterly. This social Sphinx,"
5292,FOURTH BOOK.,"Who sits between the sepulchres and stews,"
5293,FOURTH BOOK.,"Makes mock and mow against the crystal heavens,"
5294,FOURTH BOOK.,"And bullies God,—exacts a word at least"
5295,FOURTH BOOK.,"From each man standing on the side of God,"
5296,FOURTH BOOK.,However paying a sphinx-price for it.
5297,FOURTH BOOK.,"We pay it also if we hold our peace,"
5298,FOURTH BOOK.,In pangs and pity. Let me speak and die.
5299,FOURTH BOOK.,"Alas! you’ll say, I speak and kill, instead.’"
5300,FOURTH BOOK.,
5301,FOURTH BOOK.,"I pressed in there; ‘The best men, doing their best,"
5302,FOURTH BOOK.,Know peradventure least of what they do:
5303,FOURTH BOOK.,"Men usefullest i’ the world, are simply used;"
5304,FOURTH BOOK.,"The nail that holds the wood, must pierce it first,"
5305,FOURTH BOOK.,"And He alone who wields the hammer, sees"

5307,FOURTH BOOK.,
5308,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘Ah, if I could have taken yours!’ he said,"
5309,FOURTH BOOK.,"‘But that’s past now,’ Then rising ... ‘I will take"
5310,FOURTH BOOK.,At least your kindness and encouragement.
5311,FOURTH BOOK.,"I thank you. Dear, be happy. Sing your songs,"
5312,FOURTH BOOK.,"If that’s your way! but sometimes slumber too,"
5313,FOURTH BOOK.,"Nor tire too much with following, out of breath,"
5314,FOURTH BOOK.,The rhymes upon your mountains of Delight.
5315,FOURTH BOOK.,"Reflect, if Art be, in truth, the higher life,"
5316,FOURTH BOOK.,"You need the lower life to stand upon,"
5317,FOURTH BOOK.,In order to reach up unto that higher;
5318,FOURTH BOOK.,And none can stand a-tiptoe in the place
5319,FOURTH BOOK.,He cannot stand in with two stable feet.
5320,FOURTH BOOK.,"Remember then!—for Art’s sake, hold your life.’"
5321,FOURTH BOOK.,
5322,FOURTH BOOK.,We parted so. I held him in respect.
5323,FOURTH BOOK.,I comprehended what he was in heart
5324,FOURTH BOOK.,"And sacrificial greatness. Ay, but _he_"
5325,FOURTH BOOK.,Supposed me a thing too small to deign to know:
5326,FOURTH BOOK.,"He blew me, plainly, from the crucible,"
5327,FOURTH BOOK.,"As some intruding, interrupting fly"
5328,FOURTH BOOK.,Not worth the pains of his analysis
5329,FOURTH BOOK.,Absorbed on nobler subjects. Hurt a fly!
5330,FOURTH BOOK.,He would not for the world: he’s pitiful
5331,FOURTH BOOK.,"To flies even. ‘Sing,’ says he, ‘and teaze me still,"

5431,FIFTH BOOK.,His own heavens pregnant with dynastic stars;
5432,FIFTH BOOK.,"But then he must stand still, nor take a step."
5433,FIFTH BOOK.,
5434,FIFTH BOOK.,"In that descriptive poem called ‘The Hills,’"
5435,FIFTH BOOK.,The prospects were too far and indistinct.
5436,FIFTH BOOK.,"’Tis true my critics said, ‘A fine view, that!’"
5437,FIFTH BOOK.,The public scarcely cared to climb the book
5438,FIFTH BOOK.,"For even the finest; and the public’s right,"
5439,FIFTH BOOK.,"A tree’s mere firewood, unless humanised;"
5440,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which well the Greeks knew, when they stirred the bark"
5441,FIFTH BOOK.,"With close-pressed bosoms of subsiding nymphs,"
5442,FIFTH BOOK.,And made the forest-rivers garrulous
5443,FIFTH BOOK.,"With babble of gods. For us, we are called to mark"
5444,FIFTH BOOK.,A still more intimate humanity
5445,FIFTH BOOK.,"In this inferior nature,—or, ourselves,"
5446,FIFTH BOOK.,Must fall like dead leaves trodden underfoot
5447,FIFTH BOOK.,"By veritabler artists. Earth, shut up"
5448,FIFTH BOOK.,"By Adam, like a fakir in a box"
5449,FIFTH BOOK.,"Left too long buried, remained stiff and dry,"
5450,FIFTH BOOK.,"A mere dumb corpse, till Christ the Lord came down,"
5451,FIFTH BOOK.,"Unlocked the doors, forced open the blank eyes,"
5452,FIFTH BOOK.,And used his kingly chrisms to straighten out
5453,FIFTH BOOK.,The leathery tongue turned back into the throat:
5454,FIFTH BOOK.,"Since when, she lives, remembers, palpitates"
5455,FIFTH BOOK.,"In every limb, aspires in every breath,"
5456,FIFTH BOOK.,"Embraces infinite relations. Now,"
5457,FIFTH BOOK.,"We want no half-gods, Panomphæan Joves,"
5458,FIFTH BOOK.,"Fauns, Naiads, Tritons, Oreads and the rest,"
5459,FIFTH BOOK.,To take possession of a senseless world
5460,FIFTH BOOK.,"To unnatural vampire-uses. See the earth,"
5461,FIFTH BOOK.,"The body of our body, the green earth,"
5462,FIFTH BOOK.,"Indubitably human, like this flesh"
5463,FIFTH BOOK.,And these articulated veins through which
5464,FIFTH BOOK.,"Our heart drives blood! there’s not a flower of spring,"
5465,FIFTH BOOK.,"That dies ere June, but vaunts itself allied"
5466,FIFTH BOOK.,"By issue and symbol, by significance"
5467,FIFTH BOOK.,"And correspondence, to that spirit-world"
5468,FIFTH BOOK.,"Outside the limits of our space and time,"
5469,FIFTH BOOK.,Whereto we are bound. Let poets give it voice
5470,FIFTH BOOK.,"With human meanings; else they miss the thought,"
5471,FIFTH BOOK.,"And henceforth step down lower, stand confessed"
5472,FIFTH BOOK.,"Instructed poorly for interpreters,—"
5473,FIFTH BOOK.,Thrown out by an easy cowslip in the text.
5474,FIFTH BOOK.,
5475,FIFTH BOOK.,Even so my pastoral failed: it was a book
5476,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of surface-pictures—pretty, cold, and false"
5477,FIFTH BOOK.,"With literal transcript,—the worse done, I think,"
5478,FIFTH BOOK.,For being not ill-done. Let me set my mark
5479,FIFTH BOOK.,"Against such doings, and do otherwise."
5480,FIFTH BOOK.,"This strikes me.—If the public whom we know,"
5481,FIFTH BOOK.,"Could catch me at such admissions, I should pass"
5482,FIFTH BOOK.,"For being right modest. Yet how proud we are,"
5483,FIFTH BOOK.,In daring to look down upon ourselves!
5484,FIFTH BOOK.,
5485,FIFTH BOOK.,The critics say that epics have died out
5486,FIFTH BOOK.,With Agamemnon and the goat-nursed gods—
5487,FIFTH BOOK.,I’ll not believe it. I could never dream
5488,FIFTH BOOK.,"As Payne Knight did, (the mythic mountaineer"
5489,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who travelled higher than he was born to live,"
5490,FIFTH BOOK.,And showed sometimes the goitre in his throat
5491,FIFTH BOOK.,"Discoursing of an image seen through fog,)"
5492,FIFTH BOOK.,That Homer’s heroes measured twelve feet high.
5493,FIFTH BOOK.,They were but men!—his Helen’s hair turned grey
5494,FIFTH BOOK.,"Like any plain Miss Smith’s, who wears a front;"
5495,FIFTH BOOK.,And Hector’s infant blubbered at a plume
5496,FIFTH BOOK.,As yours last Friday at a turkey-cock.
5497,FIFTH BOOK.,"All men are possible heroes: every age,"
5498,FIFTH BOOK.,"Heroic in proportions, double-faced,"
5499,FIFTH BOOK.,"Looks backward and before, expects a morn"
5500,FIFTH BOOK.,And claims an epos.
5501,FIFTH BOOK.,"Ay, but every age"
5502,FIFTH BOOK.,"Appears to souls who live in it, (ask Carlyle)"
5503,FIFTH BOOK.,"Most unheroic. Ours, for instance, ours!"
5504,FIFTH BOOK.,"The thinkers scout it, and the poets abound"
5505,FIFTH BOOK.,Who scorn to touch it with a finger-tip:
5506,FIFTH BOOK.,"A pewter age,—mixed metal, silver-washed;"
5507,FIFTH BOOK.,"An age of scum, spooned off the richer past;"
5508,FIFTH BOOK.,An age of patches for old gaberdines;
5509,FIFTH BOOK.,"An age of mere transition, meaning nought,"
5510,FIFTH BOOK.,"Except that what succeeds must shame it quite,"
5511,FIFTH BOOK.,"If God please. That’s wrong thinking, to my mind,"
5512,FIFTH BOOK.,And wrong thoughts make poor poems.
5513,FIFTH BOOK.,"Every age,"
5514,FIFTH BOOK.,"Through being beheld too close, is ill-discerned"
5515,FIFTH BOOK.,By those who have not lived past it. We’ll suppose
5516,FIFTH BOOK.,"Mount Athos carved, as Persian Xerxes schemed,"
5517,FIFTH BOOK.,To some colossal statue of a man:
5518,FIFTH BOOK.,"The peasants, gathering brushwood in his ear,"
5519,FIFTH BOOK.,Had guessed as little of any human form
5520,FIFTH BOOK.,"Up there, as would a flock of browsing goats."
5521,FIFTH BOOK.,"They’d have, in fact, to travel ten miles off"
5522,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or ere the giant image broke on them,"
5523,FIFTH BOOK.,"Full human profile, nose and chin distinct,"
5524,FIFTH BOOK.,"Mouth, muttering rhythms of silence up the sky,"
5525,FIFTH BOOK.,And fed at evening with the blood of suns;
5526,FIFTH BOOK.,"Grand torso,—hand, that flung perpetually"
5527,FIFTH BOOK.,The largesse of a silver river down
5528,FIFTH BOOK.,To all the country pastures. ’Tis even thus
5529,FIFTH BOOK.,"With times we live in,—evermore too great"
5530,FIFTH BOOK.,To be apprehended near.
5531,FIFTH BOOK.,But poets should
5532,FIFTH BOOK.,Exert a double vision; should have eyes
5533,FIFTH BOOK.,To see near things as comprehensively
5534,FIFTH BOOK.,"As if afar they took their point of sight,"
5535,FIFTH BOOK.,"And distant things, as intimately deep,"
5536,FIFTH BOOK.,As if they touched them. Let us strive for this.
5537,FIFTH BOOK.,I do distrust the poet who discerns
5538,FIFTH BOOK.,"No character or glory in his times,"
5539,FIFTH BOOK.,"And trundles back his soul five hundred years,"
5540,FIFTH BOOK.,"Past moat and drawbridge, into a castle-court,"
5541,FIFTH BOOK.,Oh not to sing of lizards or of toads
5542,FIFTH BOOK.,Alive i’ the ditch there!—’twere excusable;
5543,FIFTH BOOK.,"But of some black chief, half knight, half sheep-lifter,"
5544,FIFTH BOOK.,"Some beauteous dame, half chattel and half queen,"
5545,FIFTH BOOK.,"As dead as must be, for the greater part,"
5546,FIFTH BOOK.,The poems made on their chivalric bones.
5547,FIFTH BOOK.,And that’s no wonder: death inherits death.
5548,FIFTH BOOK.,
5549,FIFTH BOOK.,"Nay, if there’s room for poets in the world"
5550,FIFTH BOOK.,"A little overgrown, (I think there is)"
5551,FIFTH BOOK.,"Their sole work is to represent the age,"
5552,FIFTH BOOK.,"Their age, not Charlemagne’s,—this live, throbbing age,"
5553,FIFTH BOOK.,"That brawls, cheats, maddens, calculates, aspires,"
5554,FIFTH BOOK.,"And spends more passion, more heroic heat,"
5555,FIFTH BOOK.,"Betwixt the mirrors of its drawing-rooms,"
5556,FIFTH BOOK.,"Than Roland with his knights, at Roncesvalles."
5557,FIFTH BOOK.,"To flinch from modern varnish, coat or flounce,"
5558,FIFTH BOOK.,"Cry out for togas and the picturesque,"
5559,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is fatal,—foolish too. King Arthur’s self"
5560,FIFTH BOOK.,Was commonplace to Lady Guenever;
5561,FIFTH BOOK.,"And Camelot to minstrels seemed as flat,"
5562,FIFTH BOOK.,As Regent Street to poets.
5563,FIFTH BOOK.,"Never flinch,"
5564,FIFTH BOOK.,"But still, unscrupulously epic, catch"
5565,FIFTH BOOK.,"Upon the burning lava of a song,"
5566,FIFTH BOOK.,"The full-veined, heaving, double-breasted Age:"
5567,FIFTH BOOK.,"That, when the next shall come, the men of that"
5568,FIFTH BOOK.,"May touch the impress with reverent hand, and say"
5569,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Behold,—behold the paps we all have sucked!"
5570,FIFTH BOOK.,"That bosom seems to beat still, or at least"
5571,FIFTH BOOK.,"It sets ours beating. This is living art,"
5572,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which thus presents, and thus records true life.’"
5573,FIFTH BOOK.,
5574,FIFTH BOOK.,What form is best for poems? Let me think
5575,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of forms less, and the external. Trust the spirit,"
5576,FIFTH BOOK.,"As sovran nature does, to make the form;"
5577,FIFTH BOOK.,"For otherwise we only imprison spirit,"
5578,FIFTH BOOK.,And not embody. Inward evermore
5579,FIFTH BOOK.,"To outward,—so in life, and so in art,"
5580,FIFTH BOOK.,Which still is life.
5581,FIFTH BOOK.,Five acts to make a play.
5582,FIFTH BOOK.,And why not fifteen? why not ten? or seven?
5583,FIFTH BOOK.,"What matter for the number of the leaves,"
5584,FIFTH BOOK.,Supposing the tree lives and grows? exact
5585,FIFTH BOOK.,"The literal unities of time and place,"
5586,FIFTH BOOK.,When ’tis the essence of passion to ignore
5587,FIFTH BOOK.,"Both time and place? Absurd. Keep up the fire,"
5588,FIFTH BOOK.,And leave the generous flames to shape themselves.
5589,FIFTH BOOK.,
5590,FIFTH BOOK.,’Tis true the stage requires obsequiousness
5591,FIFTH BOOK.,To this or that convention; ‘exit’ here
5592,FIFTH BOOK.,"And ‘enter’ there; the points for clapping, fixed,"
5593,FIFTH BOOK.,Like Jacob’s white-peeled rods before the rams;
5594,FIFTH BOOK.,And all the close-curled imagery clipped
5595,FIFTH BOOK.,In manner of their fleece at shearing-time.
5596,FIFTH BOOK.,Forget to prick the galleries to the heart
5597,FIFTH BOOK.,"Precisely at the fourth act,—culminate"
5598,FIFTH BOOK.,"Our five pyramidal acts with one act more,—"
5599,FIFTH BOOK.,We’re lost so! Shakspeare’s ghost could scarcely plead
5600,FIFTH BOOK.,Against our just damnation. Stand aside;
5601,FIFTH BOOK.,"We’ll muse for comfort that, last century,"
5602,FIFTH BOOK.,"On this same tragic stage on which we have failed,"
5603,FIFTH BOOK.,A wigless Hamlet would have failed the same.
5604,FIFTH BOOK.,
5605,FIFTH BOOK.,"And whosoever writes good poetry,"
5606,FIFTH BOOK.,Looks just to art. He does not write for you
5607,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or me,—for London or for Edinburgh;"
5608,FIFTH BOOK.,He will not suffer the best critic known
5609,FIFTH BOOK.,To step into his sunshine of free thought
5610,FIFTH BOOK.,"And self-absorbed conception, and exact"
5611,FIFTH BOOK.,An inch-long swerving of the holy lines.
5612,FIFTH BOOK.,If virtue done for popularity
5613,FIFTH BOOK.,"Defiles like vice, can art for praise or hire"
5614,FIFTH BOOK.,"Still keep its splendor, and remain pure art?"
5615,FIFTH BOOK.,"Eschew such serfdom. What the poet writes,"
5616,FIFTH BOOK.,"He writes: mankind accepts it, if it suits,"
5617,FIFTH BOOK.,"And that’s success: if not, the poem’s passed"
5618,FIFTH BOOK.,"From hand to hand, and yet from hand to hand,"
5619,FIFTH BOOK.,"Until the unborn snatch it, crying out"
5620,FIFTH BOOK.,"In pity on their fathers’ being so dull,"
5621,FIFTH BOOK.,And that’s success too.
5622,FIFTH BOOK.,I will write no plays.
5623,FIFTH BOOK.,"Because the drama, less sublime in this,"
5624,FIFTH BOOK.,"Makes lower appeals, defends more menially,"
5625,FIFTH BOOK.,Adopts the standard of the public taste
5626,FIFTH BOOK.,"To chalk its height on, wears a dog-chain round"
5627,FIFTH BOOK.,"Its regal neck, and learns to carry and fetch"
5628,FIFTH BOOK.,The fashions of the day to please the day;
5629,FIFTH BOOK.,"Fawns close on pit and boxes, who clap hands,"
5630,FIFTH BOOK.,Commending chiefly its docility
5631,FIFTH BOOK.,And humour in stage-tricks; or else indeed
5632,FIFTH BOOK.,"Gets hissed at, howled at, stamped at like a dog,"
5633,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or worse, we’ll say. For dogs, unjustly kicked,"
5634,FIFTH BOOK.,"Yell, bite at need; but if your dramatist"
5635,FIFTH BOOK.,(Being wronged by some five hundred nobodies
5636,FIFTH BOOK.,Because their grosser brains most naturally
5637,FIFTH BOOK.,Misjudge the fineness of his subtle wit)
5638,FIFTH BOOK.,"Shows teeth an almond’s breadth, protests the length"
5639,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of a modest phrase,—‘My gentle countrymen,"
5640,FIFTH BOOK.,"There’s something in it, haply, of your fault,’—"
5641,FIFTH BOOK.,"Why then, besides five hundred nobodies,"
5642,FIFTH BOOK.,"He’ll have five thousand, and five thousand more,"
5643,FIFTH BOOK.,"Against him,—the whole public,—all the hoofs"
5644,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of King Saul’s father’s asses, in full drove,—"
5645,FIFTH BOOK.,And obviously deserve it. He appealed
5646,FIFTH BOOK.,"To these,—and why say more if they condemn,"
5647,FIFTH BOOK.,"Than if they praised him?—Weep, my Æschylus,"
5648,FIFTH BOOK.,"But low and far, upon Sicilian shores!"
5649,FIFTH BOOK.,For since ’twas Athens (so I read the myth)
5650,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who gave commission to that fatal weight,"
5651,FIFTH BOOK.,"The tortoise, cold and hard, to drop on thee"
5652,FIFTH BOOK.,"And crush thee,—better cover thy bald head;"
5653,FIFTH BOOK.,She’ll hear the softest hum of Hyblan bee
5654,FIFTH BOOK.,"Before thy loud’st protesting.—For the rest,"
5655,FIFTH BOOK.,The risk’s still worse upon the modern stage:
5656,FIFTH BOOK.,"I could not, in so little, accept success,"
5657,FIFTH BOOK.,"Nor would I risk so much, in ease and calm,"
5658,FIFTH BOOK.,"For manifester gains; let those who prize,"
5659,FIFTH BOOK.,Pursue them: _I_ stand off.
5660,FIFTH BOOK.,"And yet, forbid,"
5661,FIFTH BOOK.,That any irreverent fancy or conceit
5662,FIFTH BOOK.,"Should litter in the Drama’s throne-room, where"
5663,FIFTH BOOK.,"The rulers of our art, in whose full veins"
5664,FIFTH BOOK.,"Dynastic glories mingle, sit in strength"
5665,FIFTH BOOK.,"And do their kingly work,—conceive, command,"
5666,FIFTH BOOK.,"And, from the imagination’s crucial heat,"
5667,FIFTH BOOK.,Catch up their men and women all a-flame
5668,FIFTH BOOK.,"For action, all alive, and forced to prove"
5669,FIFTH BOOK.,"Their life by living out heart, brain, and nerve,"
5670,FIFTH BOOK.,"Until mankind makes witness, ‘These be men"
5671,FIFTH BOOK.,"As we are,’ and vouchsafes the kiss that’s due"
5672,FIFTH BOOK.,To Imogen and Juliet—sweetest kin
5673,FIFTH BOOK.,On art’s side.
5674,FIFTH BOOK.,"’Tis that, honouring to its worth"
5675,FIFTH BOOK.,"The drama, I would fear to keep it down"
5676,FIFTH BOOK.,To the level of the footlights. Dies no more
5677,FIFTH BOOK.,"The sacrificial goat, for Bacchus slain,—"
5678,FIFTH BOOK.,His filmed eyes fluttered by the whirling white
5679,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of choral vestures,—troubled in his blood,"
5680,FIFTH BOOK.,"While tragic voices that clanged keen as swords,"
5681,FIFTH BOOK.,"Leapt high together with the altar-flame,"
5682,FIFTH BOOK.,"And made the blue air wink. The waxen mask,"
5683,FIFTH BOOK.,Which set the grand still front of Themis’ son
5684,FIFTH BOOK.,Upon the puckered visage of a player;—
5685,FIFTH BOOK.,"The buskin, which he rose upon and moved,"
5686,FIFTH BOOK.,"As some tall ship, first conscious of the wind,"
5687,FIFTH BOOK.,"Sweeps slowly past the piers;—the mouthpiece, where"
5688,FIFTH BOOK.,The mere man’s voice with all its breaths and breaks
5689,FIFTH BOOK.,"Went sheathed in brass, and clashed on even heights"
5690,FIFTH BOOK.,"Its phrasèd thunders;—these things are no more,"
5691,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which once were. And concluding, which is clear,"
5692,FIFTH BOOK.,The growing drama has outgrown such toys
5693,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of simulated stature, face, and speech,"
5694,FIFTH BOOK.,"It also, peradventure, may outgrow"
5695,FIFTH BOOK.,"The simulation of the painted scene,"
5696,FIFTH BOOK.,"Boards, actors, prompters, gaslight, and costume;"
5697,FIFTH BOOK.,"And take for a worthier stage the soul itself,"
5698,FIFTH BOOK.,"Its shifting fancies and celestial lights,"
5699,FIFTH BOOK.,With all its grand orchestral silences
5700,FIFTH BOOK.,To keep the pauses of the rhythmic sounds.
5701,FIFTH BOOK.,
5702,FIFTH BOOK.,"Alas, I still see something to be done,"
5703,FIFTH BOOK.,And what I do falls short of what I see
5704,FIFTH BOOK.,"Though I waste myself on doing. Long green days,"
5705,FIFTH BOOK.,"Worn bare of grass and sunshine,—long calm nights,"
5706,FIFTH BOOK.,"From which the silken sleeps were fretted out,—"
5707,FIFTH BOOK.,"Be witness for me, with no amateur’s"
5708,FIFTH BOOK.,Irreverent haste and busy idleness
5709,FIFTH BOOK.,I’ve set myself to art! What then? what’s done?
5710,FIFTH BOOK.,"What’s done, at last?"
5711,FIFTH BOOK.,"Behold, at last, a book."
5712,FIFTH BOOK.,"If life-blood’s necessary,—which it is,"
5713,FIFTH BOOK.,"(By that blue vein athrob on Mahomet’s brow,"
5714,FIFTH BOOK.,Each prophet-poet’s book must show man’s blood!)
5715,FIFTH BOOK.,"If life-blood’s fertilising, I wrung mine"
5716,FIFTH BOOK.,"On every leaf of this,—unless the drops"
5717,FIFTH BOOK.,Slid heavily on one side and left it dry.
5718,FIFTH BOOK.,That chances often: many a fervid man
5719,FIFTH BOOK.,Writes books as cold and flat as grave-yard stones
5720,FIFTH BOOK.,From which the lichen’s scraped; and if St. Preux
5721,FIFTH BOOK.,"Had written his own letters, as he might,"
5722,FIFTH BOOK.,We had never wept to think of the little mole
5723,FIFTH BOOK.,’Neath Julie’s drooping eyelid. Passion is
5724,FIFTH BOOK.,"But something suffered, after all."
5725,FIFTH BOOK.,While Art
5726,FIFTH BOOK.,Sets action on the top of suffering:
5727,FIFTH BOOK.,"The artist’s part is both to be and do,"
5728,FIFTH BOOK.,"Transfixing with a special, central power"
5729,FIFTH BOOK.,"The flat experience of the common man,"
5730,FIFTH BOOK.,"And turning outward, with a sudden wrench,"
5731,FIFTH BOOK.,"Half agony, half ecstasy, the thing"
5732,FIFTH BOOK.,He feels the inmost: never felt the less
5733,FIFTH BOOK.,Because he sings it. Does a torch less burn
5734,FIFTH BOOK.,"For burning next reflectors of blue steel,"
5735,FIFTH BOOK.,That _he_ should be the colder for his place
5736,FIFTH BOOK.,"’Twixt two incessant fires,—his personal life’s,"
5737,FIFTH BOOK.,And that intense refraction which burns back
5738,FIFTH BOOK.,Perpetually against him from the round
5739,FIFTH BOOK.,Of crystal conscience he was born into
5740,FIFTH BOOK.,If artist-born? O sorrowful great gift
5741,FIFTH BOOK.,"Conferred on poets, of a twofold life,"
5742,FIFTH BOOK.,When one life has been found enough for pain!
5743,FIFTH BOOK.,"We, staggering ’neath our burden as mere men,"
5744,FIFTH BOOK.,"Being called to stand up straight as demi-gods,"
5745,FIFTH BOOK.,Support the intolerable strain and stress
5746,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of the universal, and send clearly up"
5747,FIFTH BOOK.,"With voices broken by the human sob,"
5748,FIFTH BOOK.,Our poems to find rhymes among the stars!
5749,FIFTH BOOK.,But soft!—a ‘poet’ is a word soon said;
5750,FIFTH BOOK.,"A book’s a thing soon written. Nay, indeed,"
5751,FIFTH BOOK.,"The more the poet shall be questionable,"
5752,FIFTH BOOK.,The more unquestionably comes his book!
5753,FIFTH BOOK.,"And this of mine—well, granting to myself"
5754,FIFTH BOOK.,"Some passion in it, furrowing up the flats,"
5755,FIFTH BOOK.,Mere passion will not prove a volume worth
5756,FIFTH BOOK.,Its gall and rags even. Bubbles round a keel
5757,FIFTH BOOK.,"Mean nought, excepting that the vessel moves."
5758,FIFTH BOOK.,"There’s more than passion goes to make a man,"
5759,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or book, which is a man too."
5760,FIFTH BOOK.,I am sad.
5761,FIFTH BOOK.,"I wonder if Pygmalion had these doubts,"
5762,FIFTH BOOK.,"And, feeling the hard marble first relent,"
5763,FIFTH BOOK.,"Grow supple to the straining of his arms,"
5764,FIFTH BOOK.,"And tingle through its cold to his burning lip,"
5765,FIFTH BOOK.,"Supposed his senses mocked, and that the toil"
5766,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of stretching past the known and seen, to reach"
5767,FIFTH BOOK.,"The archetypal Beauty out of sight,"
5768,FIFTH BOOK.,"Had made his heart beat fast enough for two,"
5769,FIFTH BOOK.,And with his own life dazed and blinded him!
5770,FIFTH BOOK.,"Not so; Pygmalion loved,—and whoso loves"
5771,FIFTH BOOK.,Believes the impossible.
5772,FIFTH BOOK.,And I am sad:
5773,FIFTH BOOK.,"I cannot thoroughly love a work of mine,"
5774,FIFTH BOOK.,Since none seems worthy of my thought and hope
5775,FIFTH BOOK.,"More highly mated. He has shot them down,"
5776,FIFTH BOOK.,"My Phœbus Apollo, soul within my soul,"
5777,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who judges, by the attempted, what’s attained,"
5778,FIFTH BOOK.,"And with the silver arrow from his height,"
5779,FIFTH BOOK.,"Has struck down all my works before my face,"
5780,FIFTH BOOK.,While _I_ said nothing. Is there aught to say?
5781,FIFTH BOOK.,I called the artist but a greatened man;
5782,FIFTH BOOK.,"He may be childless also, like a man."
5783,FIFTH BOOK.,
5784,FIFTH BOOK.,I laboured on alone. The wind and dust
5785,FIFTH BOOK.,And sun of the world beat blistering in my face;
5786,FIFTH BOOK.,"And hope, now for me, now against me, dragged"
5787,FIFTH BOOK.,"My spirits onward,—as some fallen balloon,"
5788,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which, whether caught by blossoming tree or bare,"
5789,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is torn alike. I sometimes touched my aim,"
5790,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or seemed,—and generous souls cried out, ‘Be strong,"
5791,FIFTH BOOK.,"Take courage; now you’re on our level,—now!"
5792,FIFTH BOOK.,"The next step saves you!’ I was flushed with praise,"
5793,FIFTH BOOK.,"But, pausing just a moment to draw breath,"
5794,FIFTH BOOK.,I could not choose but murmur to myself
5795,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Is this all? all that’s done? and all that’s gained?
5796,FIFTH BOOK.,"If this then be success, ’tis dismaller"
5797,FIFTH BOOK.,Than any failure.’
5798,FIFTH BOOK.,"O my God, my God,"
5799,FIFTH BOOK.,"O supreme Artist, who as sole return"
5800,FIFTH BOOK.,"For all the cosmic wonder of Thy work,"
5801,FIFTH BOOK.,"Demandest of us just a word ... a name,"
5802,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘My Father!’—thou hast knowledge, only thou,"
5803,FIFTH BOOK.,How dreary ’tis for women to sit still
5804,FIFTH BOOK.,"On winter nights by solitary fires,"
5805,FIFTH BOOK.,"And hear the nations praising them far off,"
5806,FIFTH BOOK.,"Too far! ay, praising our quick sense of love,"
5807,FIFTH BOOK.,"Our very heart of passionate womanhood,"
5808,FIFTH BOOK.,Which could not beat so in the verse without
5809,FIFTH BOOK.,"Being present also in the unkissed lips,"
5810,FIFTH BOOK.,And eyes undried because there’s none to ask
5811,FIFTH BOOK.,The reason they grew moist.
5812,FIFTH BOOK.,"To sit alone,"
5813,FIFTH BOOK.,"And think, for comfort, how, that very night,"
5814,FIFTH BOOK.,"Affianced lovers, leaning face to face"
5815,FIFTH BOOK.,"With sweet half-listenings for each other’s breath,"
5816,FIFTH BOOK.,"Are reading haply from some page of ours,"
5817,FIFTH BOOK.,"To pause with a thrill, as if their cheeks had touched,"
5818,FIFTH BOOK.,"When such a stanza, level to their mood,"
5819,FIFTH BOOK.,Seems floating their own thought out—‘So I feel
5820,FIFTH BOOK.,"For thee,’—‘And I, for thee: this poet knows"
5821,FIFTH BOOK.,"What everlasting love is!’—how, that night,"
5822,FIFTH BOOK.,"A father, issuing from the misty roads"
5823,FIFTH BOOK.,Upon the luminous round of lamp and hearth
5824,FIFTH BOOK.,"And happy children, having caught up first"
5825,FIFTH BOOK.,The youngest there until it shrunk and shrieked
5826,FIFTH BOOK.,To feel the cold chin prick its dimples through
5827,FIFTH BOOK.,"With winter from the hills, may throw i’ the lap"
5828,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of the eldest, (who has learnt to drop her lids"
5829,FIFTH BOOK.,To hide some sweetness newer than last year’s)
5830,FIFTH BOOK.,"Our book and cry, ... ‘Ah you, you care for rhymes;"
5831,FIFTH BOOK.,"So here be rhymes to pore on under trees,"
5832,FIFTH BOOK.,When April comes to let you! I’ve been told
5833,FIFTH BOOK.,"They are not idle as so many are,"
5834,FIFTH BOOK.,But set hearts beating pure as well as fast:
5835,FIFTH BOOK.,"It’s yours, the book; I’ll write your name in it,—"
5836,FIFTH BOOK.,"That so you may not lose, however lost"
5837,FIFTH BOOK.,"In poet’s lore and charming reverie,"
5838,FIFTH BOOK.,The thought of how your father thought of _you_
5839,FIFTH BOOK.,In riding from the town.’
5840,FIFTH BOOK.,To have our books
5841,FIFTH BOOK.,"Appraised by love, associated with love,"
5842,FIFTH BOOK.,"While _we_ sit loveless! is it hard, you think?"
5843,FIFTH BOOK.,"At least ’tis mournful. Fame, indeed, ’twas said,"
5844,FIFTH BOOK.,Means simply love. It was a man said that.
5845,FIFTH BOOK.,"And then, there’s love and love: the love of all"
5846,FIFTH BOOK.,"(To risk, in turn, a woman’s paradox,)"
5847,FIFTH BOOK.,Is but a small thing to the love of one.
5848,FIFTH BOOK.,You bid a hungry child be satisfied
5849,FIFTH BOOK.,"With a heritage of many corn-fields: nay,"
5850,FIFTH BOOK.,"He says he’s hungry,—he would rather have"
5851,FIFTH BOOK.,That little barley-cake you keep from him
5852,FIFTH BOOK.,While reckoning up his harvests. So with us;
5853,FIFTH BOOK.,"(Here, Romney, too, we fail to generalise!)"
5854,FIFTH BOOK.,We’re hungry.
5855,FIFTH BOOK.,Hungry! but it’s pitiful
5856,FIFTH BOOK.,To wail like unweaned babes and suck our thumbs
5857,FIFTH BOOK.,"Because we’re hungry. Who, in all this world,"
5858,FIFTH BOOK.,"(Wherein we are haply set to pray and fast,"
5859,FIFTH BOOK.,And learn what good is by its opposite)
5860,FIFTH BOOK.,Has never hungered? Woe to him who has found
5861,FIFTH BOOK.,"The meal enough! if Ugolino’s full,"
5862,FIFTH BOOK.,His teeth have crunched some foul unnatural thing:
5863,FIFTH BOOK.,For here satiety proves penury
5864,FIFTH BOOK.,More utterly irremediable. And since
5865,FIFTH BOOK.,"We needs must hunger,—better, for man’s love,"
5866,FIFTH BOOK.,"Than God’s truth! better, for companions sweet,"
5867,FIFTH BOOK.,"Than great convictions! let us bear our weights,"
5868,FIFTH BOOK.,Preferring dreary hearths to desert souls.
5869,FIFTH BOOK.,"Well, well! they say we’re envious, we who rhyme;"
5870,FIFTH BOOK.,"But I, because I am a woman perhaps,"
5871,FIFTH BOOK.,"And so rhyme ill, am ill at envying."
5872,FIFTH BOOK.,"I never envied Graham his breadth of style,"
5873,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which gives you, with a random smutch or two,"
5874,FIFTH BOOK.,(Near-sighted critics analyse to smutch)
5875,FIFTH BOOK.,Such delicate perspectives of full life;
5876,FIFTH BOOK.,"Nor Belmore, for the unity of aim"
5877,FIFTH BOOK.,"To which he cuts his cedarn poems, fine"
5878,FIFTH BOOK.,"As sketchers do their pencils; nor Mark Gage,"
5879,FIFTH BOOK.,For that caressing colour and trancing tone
5880,FIFTH BOOK.,Whereby you’re swept away and melted in
5881,FIFTH BOOK.,"The sensual element, which, with a back wave,"
5882,FIFTH BOOK.,Restores you to the level of pure souls
5883,FIFTH BOOK.,"And leaves you with Plotinus. None of these,"
5884,FIFTH BOOK.,"For native gifts or popular applause,"
5885,FIFTH BOOK.,"I’ve envied; but for this,—that when, by chance,"
5886,FIFTH BOOK.,"Says some one,—‘There goes Belmore, a great man!"
5887,FIFTH BOOK.,"He leaves clean work behind him, and requires"
5888,FIFTH BOOK.,"No sweeper up of the chips,’ ... a girl I know,"
5889,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who answers nothing, save with her brown eyes,"
5890,FIFTH BOOK.,"Smiles unaware, as if a guardian saint"
5891,FIFTH BOOK.,"Smiled in her:—for this, too,—that Gage comes home"
5892,FIFTH BOOK.,And lays his last book’s prodigal review
5893,FIFTH BOOK.,"Upon his mother’s knees, where, years ago,"
5894,FIFTH BOOK.,He had laid his childish spelling-book and learned
5895,FIFTH BOOK.,"To chirp and peck the letters from her mouth,"
5896,FIFTH BOOK.,"As young birds must. ‘Well done,’ she murmured then,"
5897,FIFTH BOOK.,She will not say it now more wonderingly;
5898,FIFTH BOOK.,"And yet the last ‘Well done’ will touch him more,"
5899,FIFTH BOOK.,As catching up to-day and yesterday
5900,FIFTH BOOK.,"In a perfect chord of love; and so, Mark Gage."
5901,FIFTH BOOK.,"I envy you your mother!—and you, Graham,"
5902,FIFTH BOOK.,"Because you have a wife who loves you so,"
5903,FIFTH BOOK.,"She half forgets, at moments, to be proud"
5904,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of being Graham’s wife, until a friend observes,"
5905,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘The boy here, has his father’s massive brow,"
5906,FIFTH BOOK.,Done small in wax ... if we push back the curls.’
5907,FIFTH BOOK.,
5908,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who loves _me_? Dearest father,—mother sweet,—"
5909,FIFTH BOOK.,"I speak the names out sometimes by myself,"
5910,FIFTH BOOK.,"And make the silence shiver: they sound strange,"
5911,FIFTH BOOK.,As Hindostanee to an Ind-born man
5912,FIFTH BOOK.,Accustomed many years to English speech;
5913,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or lovely poet-words grown obsolete,"
5914,FIFTH BOOK.,Which will not leave off singing. Up in heaven
5915,FIFTH BOOK.,"I have my father,—with my mother’s face"
5916,FIFTH BOOK.,Beside him in a blotch of heavenly light;
5917,FIFTH BOOK.,"No more for earth’s familiar, household use,"
5918,FIFTH BOOK.,"No more! The best verse written by this hand,"
5919,FIFTH BOOK.,"Can never reach them where they sit, to seem"
5920,FIFTH BOOK.,"Well-done to _them_. Death quite unfellows us,"
5921,FIFTH BOOK.,"Sets dreadful odds betwixt the live and dead,"
5922,FIFTH BOOK.,"And makes us part as those at Babel did,"
5923,FIFTH BOOK.,Through sudden ignorance of a common tongue.
5924,FIFTH BOOK.,A living Cæsar would not dare to play
5925,FIFTH BOOK.,"At bowls, with such as my dead father is."
5926,FIFTH BOOK.,
5927,FIFTH BOOK.,"And yet, this may be less so than appears,"
5928,FIFTH BOOK.,This change and separation. Sparrows five
5929,FIFTH BOOK.,"For just two farthings, and God cares for each."
5930,FIFTH BOOK.,"If God is not too great for little cares,"
5931,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is any creature, because gone to God?"
5932,FIFTH BOOK.,"I’ve seen some men, veracious, nowise mad,"
5933,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who have thought or dreamed, declared and testified,"
5934,FIFTH BOOK.,They’ve heard the Dead a-ticking like a clock
5935,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which strikes the hours of the eternities,"
5936,FIFTH BOOK.,"Beside them, with their natural ears,—and known"
5937,FIFTH BOOK.,"That human spirits feel the human way,"
5938,FIFTH BOOK.,And hate the unreasoning awe which waves them off
5939,FIFTH BOOK.,From possible communion. It may be.
5940,FIFTH BOOK.,
5941,FIFTH BOOK.,"At least, earth separates as well as heaven."
5942,FIFTH BOOK.,"For instance, I have not seen Romney Leigh"
5943,FIFTH BOOK.,"Full eighteen months ... add six, you get two years."
5944,FIFTH BOOK.,"They say he’s very busy with good works,—"
5945,FIFTH BOOK.,Has parted Leigh Hall into almshouses.
5946,FIFTH BOOK.,"He made an almshouse of his heart one day,"
5947,FIFTH BOOK.,Which ever since is loose upon the latch
5948,FIFTH BOOK.,For those who pull the string.—I never did.
5949,FIFTH BOOK.,
5950,FIFTH BOOK.,It always makes me sad to go abroad;
5951,FIFTH BOOK.,And now I’m sadder that I went to-night
5952,FIFTH BOOK.,Among the lights and talkers at Lord Howe’s.
5953,FIFTH BOOK.,"His wife is gracious, with her glossy braids,"
5954,FIFTH BOOK.,"And even voice, and gorgeous eyeballs, calm"
5955,FIFTH BOOK.,"As her other jewels. If she’s somewhat cold,"
5956,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who wonders, when her blood has stood so long"
5957,FIFTH BOOK.,In the ducal reservoir she calls her line
5958,FIFTH BOOK.,By no means arrogantly? she’s not proud;
5959,FIFTH BOOK.,Not prouder than the swan is of the lake
5960,FIFTH BOOK.,"He has always swum in;—’tis her element,"
5961,FIFTH BOOK.,"And so she takes it with a natural grace,"
5962,FIFTH BOOK.,"Ignoring tadpoles. She just knows, perhaps,"
5963,FIFTH BOOK.,"There _are_ men, move on without outriders,"
5964,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which isn’t her fault. Ah, to watch her face,"
5965,FIFTH BOOK.,When good Lord Howe expounds his theories
5966,FIFTH BOOK.,Of social justice and equality—
5967,FIFTH BOOK.,"’Tis curious, what a tender, tolerant bend"
5968,FIFTH BOOK.,"Her neck takes: for she loves him, likes his talk,"
5969,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Such clever talk—that dear, odd Algernon!’"
5970,FIFTH BOOK.,"She listens on, exactly as if he talked"
5971,FIFTH BOOK.,"Some Scandinavian myth of Lemures,"
5972,FIFTH BOOK.,"Too pretty to dispute, and too absurd."
5973,FIFTH BOOK.,
5974,FIFTH BOOK.,"She’s gracious to me as her husband’s friend,"
5975,FIFTH BOOK.,"And would be gracious, were I not a Leigh,"
5976,FIFTH BOOK.,"Being used to smile just so, without her eyes,"
5977,FIFTH BOOK.,"On Joseph Strangways, the Leeds mesmerist,"
5978,FIFTH BOOK.,"And Delia Dobbs, the lecturer from ‘the States’"
5979,FIFTH BOOK.,"Upon the ‘Woman’s question.’ Then, for him,"
5980,FIFTH BOOK.,I like him ... he’s my friend. And all the rooms
5981,FIFTH BOOK.,Were full of crinkling silks that swept about
5982,FIFTH BOOK.,The fine dust of most subtle courtesies.
5983,FIFTH BOOK.,"What then?—why then, we come home to be sad."
5984,FIFTH BOOK.,
5985,FIFTH BOOK.,"How lovely One I love not, looked to-night!"
5986,FIFTH BOOK.,"She’s very pretty, Lady Waldemar."
5987,FIFTH BOOK.,Her maid must use both hands to twist that coil
5988,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of tresses, then be careful lest the rich"
5989,FIFTH BOOK.,"Bronze rounds should slip:—she missed, though, a grey hair,"
5990,FIFTH BOOK.,"A single one,—I saw it; otherwise"
5991,FIFTH BOOK.,"The woman looked immortal. How they told,"
5992,FIFTH BOOK.,"Those alabaster shoulders and bare breasts,"
5993,FIFTH BOOK.,"On which the pearls, drowned out of sight in milk,"
5994,FIFTH BOOK.,"Were lost, excepting for the ruby-clasp!"
5995,FIFTH BOOK.,They split the amaranth velvet-boddice down
5996,FIFTH BOOK.,"To the waist, or nearly, with the audacious press"
5997,FIFTH BOOK.,Of full-breathed beauty. If the heart within
5998,FIFTH BOOK.,"Were half as white!—but, if it were, perhaps"
5999,FIFTH BOOK.,"The breast were closer covered, and the sight"
6000,FIFTH BOOK.,"Less aspectable, by half, too."
6001,FIFTH BOOK.,I heard
6002,FIFTH BOOK.,The young man with the German student’s look—
6003,FIFTH BOOK.,"A sharp face, like a knife in a cleft stick,"
6004,FIFTH BOOK.,Which shot up straight against the parting line
6005,FIFTH BOOK.,"So equally dividing the long hair,—"
6006,FIFTH BOOK.,"Say softly to his neighbour, (thirty-five"
6007,FIFTH BOOK.,"And mediæval) ‘Look that way, Sir Blaise."
6008,FIFTH BOOK.,"She’s Lady Waldemar—to the left,—in red—"
6009,FIFTH BOOK.,"Whom Romney Leigh, our ablest man just now,"
6010,FIFTH BOOK.,Is soon about to marry.’
6011,FIFTH BOOK.,Then replied
6012,FIFTH BOOK.,"Sir Blaise Delorme, with quiet, priestlike voice,"
6013,FIFTH BOOK.,Too used to syllable damnations round
6014,FIFTH BOOK.,To make a natural emphasis worth while:
6015,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Is Leigh your ablest man? the same, I think,"
6016,FIFTH BOOK.,Once jilted by a recreant pretty maid
6017,FIFTH BOOK.,"Adopted from the people? Now, in change,"
6018,FIFTH BOOK.,He seems to have plucked a flower from the other side
6019,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of the social hedge,’"
6020,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘A flower, a flower,’ exclaimed"
6021,FIFTH BOOK.,"My German student,—his own eyes full-blown"
6022,FIFTH BOOK.,"Bent on her. He was twenty, certainly."
6023,FIFTH BOOK.,
6024,FIFTH BOOK.,"Sir Blaise resumed with gentle arrogance,"
6025,FIFTH BOOK.,"As if he had dropped his alms into a hat,"
6026,FIFTH BOOK.,"And had the right to counsel,—‘My young friend,"
6027,FIFTH BOOK.,I doubt your ablest man’s ability
6028,FIFTH BOOK.,"To get the least good or help meet for him,"
6029,FIFTH BOOK.,"For pagan phalanstery or Christian home,"
6030,FIFTH BOOK.,"From such a flowery creature,’"
6031,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Beautiful!’
6032,FIFTH BOOK.,"My student murmured, rapt,—‘Mark how she stirs!"
6033,FIFTH BOOK.,"Just waves her head, as if a flower indeed,"
6034,FIFTH BOOK.,Touched far off by the vain breath of our talk.’
6035,FIFTH BOOK.,
6036,FIFTH BOOK.,"At which that bilious Grimwald, (he who writes"
6037,FIFTH BOOK.,For the Renovator) who had seemed absorbed
6038,FIFTH BOOK.,"Upon the table-book of autographs,"
6039,FIFTH BOOK.,(I dare say mentally he crunched the bones
6040,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of all those writers, wishing them alive"
6041,FIFTH BOOK.,To feel his tooth in earnest) turned short round
6042,FIFTH BOOK.,"With low carnivorous laugh,—‘A flower, of course!"
6043,FIFTH BOOK.,"She neither sews nor spins,—and takes no thought"
6044,FIFTH BOOK.,Of her garments ... falling off.’
6045,FIFTH BOOK.,"The student flinched,"
6046,FIFTH BOOK.,"Sir Blaise, the same; then both, drawing back their chairs"
6047,FIFTH BOOK.,"As if they spied black-beetles on the floor,"
6048,FIFTH BOOK.,"Pursued their talk, without a word being thrown"
6049,FIFTH BOOK.,To the critic.
6050,FIFTH BOOK.,Good Sir Blaise’s brow is high
6051,FIFTH BOOK.,"And noticeably narrow: a strong wind,"
6052,FIFTH BOOK.,"You fancy, might unroof him suddenly,"
6053,FIFTH BOOK.,And blow that great top attic off his head
6054,FIFTH BOOK.,So piled with feudal relics. You admire
6055,FIFTH BOOK.,"His nose in profile, though you miss his chin;"
6056,FIFTH BOOK.,"But, though you miss his chin, you seldom miss"
6057,FIFTH BOOK.,"His golden cross worn innermostly, (carved"
6058,FIFTH BOOK.,"For penance, by a saintly Styrian monk"
6059,FIFTH BOOK.,"Whose flesh was too much with him,) slipping through"
6060,FIFTH BOOK.,Some unaware unbuttoned casualty
6061,FIFTH BOOK.,Of the under-waistcoat. With an absent air
6062,FIFTH BOOK.,"Sir Blaise sate fingering it and speaking low,"
6063,FIFTH BOOK.,"While I, upon the sofa, heard it all."
6064,FIFTH BOOK.,
6065,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘My dear young friend, if we could bear our eyes"
6066,FIFTH BOOK.,"Like blessedest St. Lucy, on a plate,"
6067,FIFTH BOOK.,"They would not trick us into choosing wives,"
6068,FIFTH BOOK.,"As doublets, by the colour. Otherwise"
6069,FIFTH BOOK.,"Our fathers chose,—and therefore, when they had hung"
6070,FIFTH BOOK.,"Their household keys about a lady’s waist,"
6071,FIFTH BOOK.,The sense of duty gave her dignity:
6072,FIFTH BOOK.,She kept her bosom holy to her babes;
6073,FIFTH BOOK.,"And, if a moralist reproved her dress,"
6074,FIFTH BOOK.,"’Twas, ‘Too much starch!’—and not, ‘Too little lawn!’'"
6075,FIFTH BOOK.,
6076,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Now, pshaw!’ returned the other in a heat,"
6077,FIFTH BOOK.,"A little fretted by being called ‘young friend,’"
6078,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or so I took it,—‘for St. Lucy’s sake,"
6079,FIFTH BOOK.,"If she’s the saint to curse by, let us leave"
6080,FIFTH BOOK.,"Our fathers,—plagued enough about our sons!’"
6081,FIFTH BOOK.,"(He stroked his beardless chin) ‘yes, plagued, sir, plagued:"
6082,FIFTH BOOK.,The future generations lie on us
6083,FIFTH BOOK.,As heavy as the nightmare of a seer;
6084,FIFTH BOOK.,Our meat and drink grow painful prophecy:
6085,FIFTH BOOK.,"I ask you,—have we leisure, if we liked,"
6086,FIFTH BOOK.,To hollow out our weary hands to keep
6087,FIFTH BOOK.,Your intermittent rushlight of the past
6088,FIFTH BOOK.,"From draughts in lobbies? Prejudice of sex,"
6089,FIFTH BOOK.,And marriage-laws ... the socket drops them through
6090,FIFTH BOOK.,"While we two speak,—however may protest"
6091,FIFTH BOOK.,"Some over-delicate nostrils, like your own,"
6092,FIFTH BOOK.,’Gainst odours thence arising.’
6093,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘You are young,’"
6094,FIFTH BOOK.,Sir Blaise objected.
6095,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘If I am,’ he said"
6096,FIFTH BOOK.,"With fire,—‘though somewhat less so than I seem,"
6097,FIFTH BOOK.,"The young run on before, and see the thing"
6098,FIFTH BOOK.,"That’s coming. Reverence for the young, I cry."
6099,FIFTH BOOK.,"In that new church for which the world’s near ripe,"
6100,FIFTH BOOK.,"You’ll have the younger in the Elder’s chair,"
6101,FIFTH BOOK.,Presiding with his ivory front of hope
6102,FIFTH BOOK.,O’er foreheads clawed by cruel carrion-birds
6103,FIFTH BOOK.,Of life’s experience.’
6104,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Pray your blessing, sir,’"
6105,FIFTH BOOK.,"Sir Blaise replied good-humouredly,—‘I plucked"
6106,FIFTH BOOK.,"A silver hair this morning from my beard,"
6107,FIFTH BOOK.,Which left me your inferior. Would I were
6108,FIFTH BOOK.,"Eighteen, and worthy to admonish you!"
6109,FIFTH BOOK.,If young men of your order run before
6110,FIFTH BOOK.,To see such sights as sexual prejudice
6111,FIFTH BOOK.,"And marriage-law dissolved,—in plainer words,"
6112,FIFTH BOOK.,A general concubinage expressed
6113,FIFTH BOOK.,"In a universal pruriency,—the thing"
6114,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is scarce worth running fast for, and you’d gain"
6115,FIFTH BOOK.,By loitering with your elders.’
6116,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Ah,’ he said,"
6117,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Who, getting to the top of Pisgah-hill,"
6118,FIFTH BOOK.,"Can talk with one at bottom of the view,"
6119,FIFTH BOOK.,"To make it comprehensible? Why, Leigh"
6120,FIFTH BOOK.,"Himself, although our ablest man, I said,"
6121,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is scarce advanced to see as far as this,"
6122,FIFTH BOOK.,Which some are: he takes up imperfectly
6123,FIFTH BOOK.,The social question—by one handle—leaves
6124,FIFTH BOOK.,"The rest to trail. A Christian socialist,"
6125,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is Romney Leigh, you understand.’"
6126,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Not I.
6127,FIFTH BOOK.,"I disbelieve in Christian-pagans, much"
6128,FIFTH BOOK.,As you in women-fishes. If we mix
6129,FIFTH BOOK.,"Two colours, we lose both, and make a third"
6130,FIFTH BOOK.,Distinct from either. Mark you! to mistake
6131,FIFTH BOOK.,"A colour is the sign of a sick brain,"
6132,FIFTH BOOK.,"And mine, I thank the saints, is clear and cool:"
6133,FIFTH BOOK.,A neutral tint is here impossible.
6134,FIFTH BOOK.,"The church,—and by the church, I mean, of course,"
6135,FIFTH BOOK.,"The catholic, apostolic, mother-church,—"
6136,FIFTH BOOK.,Draws lines as plain and straight as her own wall;
6137,FIFTH BOOK.,"Inside of which, are Christians, obviously,"
6138,FIFTH BOOK.,And outside ... dogs.’
6139,FIFTH BOOK.,‘We thank you. Well I know
6140,FIFTH BOOK.,"The ancient mother-church would fain still bite,"
6141,FIFTH BOOK.,"For all her toothless gums,—as Leigh himself"
6142,FIFTH BOOK.,"Would fain be a Christian still, for all his wit;"
6143,FIFTH BOOK.,"Pass that; you two may settle it, for me."
6144,FIFTH BOOK.,You’re slow in England. In a month I learnt
6145,FIFTH BOOK.,"At Göttingen, enough philosophy"
6146,FIFTH BOOK.,To stock your English schools for fifty years;
6147,FIFTH BOOK.,"Pass that, too. Here, alone, I stop you short,"
6148,FIFTH BOOK.,—Supposing a true man like Leigh could stand
6149,FIFTH BOOK.,Unequal in the stature of his life
6150,FIFTH BOOK.,To the height of his opinions. Choose a wife
6151,FIFTH BOOK.,"Because of a smooth skin?—not he, not he!"
6152,FIFTH BOOK.,"He’d rail at Venus’ self for creaking shoes,"
6153,FIFTH BOOK.,Unless she walked his way of righteousness:
6154,FIFTH BOOK.,"And if he takes a Venus Meretrix,"
6155,FIFTH BOOK.,(No imputation on the lady there)
6156,FIFTH BOOK.,"Be sure that, by some sleight of Christian art,"
6157,FIFTH BOOK.,He has metamorphosed and converted her
6158,FIFTH BOOK.,To a Blessed Virgin.’
6159,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Soft!’ Sir Blaise drew breath
6160,FIFTH BOOK.,"As if it hurt him,—‘Soft! no blasphemy,"
6161,FIFTH BOOK.,I pray you!’
6162,FIFTH BOOK.,‘The first Christians did the thing;
6163,FIFTH BOOK.,"Why not the last?’ asked he of Göttingen,"
6164,FIFTH BOOK.,"With just that shade of sneering on the lip,"
6165,FIFTH BOOK.,"Compensates for the lagging of the beard,—"
6166,FIFTH BOOK.,‘And so the case is. If that fairest fair
6167,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is talked of as the future wife of Leigh,"
6168,FIFTH BOOK.,"She’s talked of, too, at least as certainly,"
6169,FIFTH BOOK.,As Leigh’s disciple. You may find her name
6170,FIFTH BOOK.,"On all his missions and commissions, schools,"
6171,FIFTH BOOK.,"Asylums, hospitals,—he has had her down,"
6172,FIFTH BOOK.,With other ladies whom her starry lead
6173,FIFTH BOOK.,"Persuaded from their spheres, to his country-place"
6174,FIFTH BOOK.,"In Shropshire, to the famed phalanstery"
6175,FIFTH BOOK.,"At Leigh Hall, christianised from Fourier’s own,"
6176,FIFTH BOOK.,(In which he has planted out his sapling stocks
6177,FIFTH BOOK.,Of knowledge into social nurseries)
6178,FIFTH BOOK.,"And there, they say, she has tarried half a week,"
6179,FIFTH BOOK.,"And milked the cows, and churned, and pressed the curd,"
6180,FIFTH BOOK.,And said ‘my sister’ to the lowest drab
6181,FIFTH BOOK.,Of all the assembled castaways; such girls!
6182,FIFTH BOOK.,"Ay, sided with them at the washing-tub—"
6183,FIFTH BOOK.,"Conceive, Sir Blaise, those naked perfect arms,"
6184,FIFTH BOOK.,"Round glittering arms, plunged elbow-deep in suds,"
6185,FIFTH BOOK.,Like wild swans hid in lilies all a-shake.’
6186,FIFTH BOOK.,
6187,FIFTH BOOK.,"Lord Howe came up. ‘What, talking poetry"
6188,FIFTH BOOK.,So near the image of the unfavouring Muse?
6189,FIFTH BOOK.,"That’s you, Miss Leigh: I’ve watched you half an hour,"
6190,FIFTH BOOK.,Precisely as I watched the statue called
6191,FIFTH BOOK.,A Pallas in the Vatican;—you mind
6192,FIFTH BOOK.,"The face, Sir Blaise?—intensely calm and sad,"
6193,FIFTH BOOK.,"As wisdom cut it off from fellowship,—"
6194,FIFTH BOOK.,But _that_ spoke louder. Not a word from _you_!
6195,FIFTH BOOK.,"And these two gentlemen were bold, I marked,"
6196,FIFTH BOOK.,And unabashed by even your silence.’
6197,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Ah,’"
6198,FIFTH BOOK.,"Said I, ‘my dear Lord Howe, you shall not speak"
6199,FIFTH BOOK.,"To a printing woman who has lost her place,"
6200,FIFTH BOOK.,(The sweet safe corner of the household fire
6201,FIFTH BOOK.,"Behind the heads of children) compliments,"
6202,FIFTH BOOK.,As if she were a woman. We who have clipt
6203,FIFTH BOOK.,"The curls before our eyes, may see at least"
6204,FIFTH BOOK.,"As plain as men do: speak out, man to man;"
6205,FIFTH BOOK.,"No compliments, beseech you.’"
6206,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Friend to friend,"
6207,FIFTH BOOK.,"Let that be. We are sad to-night, I saw,"
6208,FIFTH BOOK.,"(—Good night, Sir Blaise! Ah, Smith—he has slipped away)"
6209,FIFTH BOOK.,"I saw you across the room, and stayed, Miss Leigh,"
6210,FIFTH BOOK.,"To keep a crowd of lion-hunters off,"
6211,FIFTH BOOK.,With faces toward your jungle. There were three;
6212,FIFTH BOOK.,"A spacious lady, five feet ten and fat,"
6213,FIFTH BOOK.,Who has the devil in her (and there’s room)
6214,FIFTH BOOK.,"For walking to and fro upon the earth,"
6215,FIFTH BOOK.,From Chipewa to China; she requires
6216,FIFTH BOOK.,Your autograph upon a tinted leaf
6217,FIFTH BOOK.,’Twixt Queen Pomare’s and Emperor Soulouque’s;
6218,FIFTH BOOK.,"Pray give it; she has energies, though fat:"
6219,FIFTH BOOK.,"For me, I’d rather see a rick on fire"
6220,FIFTH BOOK.,Than such a woman angry. Then a youth
6221,FIFTH BOOK.,"Fresh from the backwoods, green as the underboughs,"
6222,FIFTH BOOK.,"Asks modestly, Miss Leigh, to kiss your shoe,"
6223,FIFTH BOOK.,"And adds, he has an epic, in twelve parts,"
6224,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which when you’ve read, you’ll do it for his boot,—"
6225,FIFTH BOOK.,"All which I saved you, and absorb next week"
6226,FIFTH BOOK.,"Both manuscript and man,—because a lord"
6227,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is still more potent than a poetess,"
6228,FIFTH BOOK.,"With any extreme republican. Ah, ah,"
6229,FIFTH BOOK.,"You smile at last, then.’"
6230,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Thank you.’
6231,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Leave the smile,"
6232,FIFTH BOOK.,"I’ll lose the thanks for ’t,—ay, and throw you in"
6233,FIFTH BOOK.,"My transatlantic girl, with golden eyes,"
6234,FIFTH BOOK.,"That draw you to her splendid whiteness, as"
6235,FIFTH BOOK.,"The pistil of a water-lily draws,"
6236,FIFTH BOOK.,Adust with gold. Those girls across the sea
6237,FIFTH BOOK.,"Are tyrannously pretty,—and I swore"
6238,FIFTH BOOK.,"(She seemed to me an innocent, frank girl)"
6239,FIFTH BOOK.,"To bring her to you for a woman’s kiss,"
6240,FIFTH BOOK.,"Not now, but on some other day or week:"
6241,FIFTH BOOK.,—We’ll call it perjury; I give her up.’
6242,FIFTH BOOK.,
6243,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘No, bring her.’"
6244,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Now,’ said he, ‘you make it hard"
6245,FIFTH BOOK.,To touch such goodness with a grimy palm.
6246,FIFTH BOOK.,"I thought to tease you well, and fret you cross,"
6247,FIFTH BOOK.,"And steel myself, when rightly vexed with you,"
6248,FIFTH BOOK.,For telling you a thing to tease you more.’
6249,FIFTH BOOK.,
6250,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Of Romney?’
6251,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘No, no; nothing worse,’ he cried,"
6252,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Of Romney Leigh, than what is buzzed about,—"
6253,FIFTH BOOK.,"That _he_ is taken in an eye-trap too,"
6254,FIFTH BOOK.,Like many half as wise. The thing I mean
6255,FIFTH BOOK.,"Refers to you, not him.’"
6256,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Refers to me.’
6257,FIFTH BOOK.,"He echoed,—‘Me! You sound it like a stone"
6258,FIFTH BOOK.,"Dropped down a dry well very listlessly,"
6259,FIFTH BOOK.,By one who never thinks about the toad
6260,FIFTH BOOK.,Alive at the bottom. Presently perhaps
6261,FIFTH BOOK.,You’ll sound your ‘me’ more proudly—till I shrink.’
6262,FIFTH BOOK.,
6263,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Lord Howe’s the toad, then, in this question?’"
6264,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Brief,"
6265,FIFTH BOOK.,"We’ll take it graver. Give me sofa-room,"
6266,FIFTH BOOK.,"And quiet hearing. You know Eglinton,"
6267,FIFTH BOOK.,"John Eglinton, of Eglinton in Kent?’"
6268,FIFTH BOOK.,
6269,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Is _he_ the toad?—he’s rather like the snail;
6270,FIFTH BOOK.,Known chiefly for the house upon his back:
6271,FIFTH BOOK.,Divide the man and house—you kill the man;
6272,FIFTH BOOK.,"That’s Eglinton of Eglinton, Lord Howe.’"
6273,FIFTH BOOK.,
6274,FIFTH BOOK.,"He answered grave. ‘A reputable man,"
6275,FIFTH BOOK.,"An excellent landlord of the olden stamp,"
6276,FIFTH BOOK.,If somewhat slack in new philanthropies;
6277,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who keeps his birthdays with a tenants’ dance,"
6278,FIFTH BOOK.,Is hard upon them when they miss the church
6279,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or keep their children back from catechism,"
6280,FIFTH BOOK.,But not ungentle when the aged poor
6281,FIFTH BOOK.,"Pick sticks at hedge-sides; nay, I’ve heard him say,"
6282,FIFTH BOOK.,‘The old dame has a twinge because she stoops:
6283,FIFTH BOOK.,‘That’s punishment enough for felony.’’
6284,FIFTH BOOK.,
6285,FIFTH BOOK.,‘O tender-hearted landlord! May I take
6286,FIFTH BOOK.,"My long lease with him, when the time arrives"
6287,FIFTH BOOK.,For gathering winter-faggots!’
6288,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘He likes art,"
6289,FIFTH BOOK.,Buys books and pictures ... of a certain kind;
6290,FIFTH BOOK.,Neglects no patent duty; a good son’....
6291,FIFTH BOOK.,
6292,FIFTH BOOK.,‘To a most obedient mother. Born to wear
6293,FIFTH BOOK.,"His father’s shoes, he wears her husband’s too:"
6294,FIFTH BOOK.,"Indeed, I’ve heard it’s touching. Dear Lord Howe,"
6295,FIFTH BOOK.,"You shall not praise _me_ so against your heart,"
6296,FIFTH BOOK.,When I’m at worst for praise and faggots.’
6297,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Be
6298,FIFTH BOOK.,"Less bitter with me, for ... in short,’ he said,"
6299,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘I have a letter, which he urged me so"
6300,FIFTH BOOK.,To bring you ... I could scarcely choose but yield;
6301,FIFTH BOOK.,Insisting that a new love passing through
6302,FIFTH BOOK.,"The hand of an old friendship, caught from it"
6303,FIFTH BOOK.,Some reconciling perfume.’
6304,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Love, you say?"
6305,FIFTH BOOK.,"My lord, I cannot love. I only find"
6306,FIFTH BOOK.,"The rhymes for love,—and that’s not love, my lord."
6307,FIFTH BOOK.,Take back your letter.’
6308,FIFTH BOOK.,‘Pause: you’ll read it first?’
6309,FIFTH BOOK.,
6310,FIFTH BOOK.,‘I will not read it: it is stereotyped;
6311,FIFTH BOOK.,"The same he wrote to,—anybody’s name,—"
6312,FIFTH BOOK.,"Anne Blythe, the actress, when she had died so true,"
6313,FIFTH BOOK.,A duchess fainted in a private box:
6314,FIFTH BOOK.,"Pauline, the dancer, after the great _pas_,"
6315,FIFTH BOOK.,In which her little feet winked overhead
6316,FIFTH BOOK.,"Like other fire-flies, and amazed the pit:"
6317,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or Baldinacci, when her F in alt"
6318,FIFTH BOOK.,Had touched the silver tops of heaven itself
6319,FIFTH BOOK.,"With such a pungent soul-dart, even the Queen"
6320,FIFTH BOOK.,"Laid softly, each to each, her white-gloved palms,"
6321,FIFTH BOOK.,And sighed for joy: or else (I thank your friend)
6322,FIFTH BOOK.,"Aurora Leigh,—when some indifferent rhymes,"
6323,FIFTH BOOK.,Like those the boys sang round the holy ox
6324,FIFTH BOOK.,"On Memphis-road, have chanced, perhaps, to set"
6325,FIFTH BOOK.,"Our Apis-public lowing. Oh, he wants,"
6326,FIFTH BOOK.,"Instead of any worthy wife at home,"
6327,FIFTH BOOK.,A star upon his stage of Eglinton!
6328,FIFTH BOOK.,Advise him that he is not overshrewd
6329,FIFTH BOOK.,In being so little modest: a dropped star
6330,FIFTH BOOK.,"Makes bitter waters, says a Book I’ve read,—"
6331,FIFTH BOOK.,And there’s his unread letter.’
6332,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘My dear friend,’"
6333,FIFTH BOOK.,Lord Howe began....
6334,FIFTH BOOK.,
6335,FIFTH BOOK.,In haste I tore the phrase.
6336,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘You mean your friend of Eglinton, or me?’"
6337,FIFTH BOOK.,
6338,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘I mean you, you,’ he answered with some fire."
6339,FIFTH BOOK.,‘A happy life means prudent compromise;
6340,FIFTH BOOK.,The tare runs through the farmer’s garnered sheaves;
6341,FIFTH BOOK.,"But though the gleaner’s apron holds pure wheat,"
6342,FIFTH BOOK.,"We count her poorer. Tare with wheat, we cry,"
6343,FIFTH BOOK.,"And good with drawbacks. You, you love your art,"
6344,FIFTH BOOK.,"And, certain of vocation, set your soul"
6345,FIFTH BOOK.,"On utterance. Only, ... in this world we have made,"
6346,FIFTH BOOK.,"(They say God made it first, but, if He did,"
6347,FIFTH BOOK.,"’Twas so long since, ... and, since, we have spoiled it so,"
6348,FIFTH BOOK.,"He scarce would know it, if He looked this way,"
6349,FIFTH BOOK.,"From hells we preach of, with the flames blown out,)"
6350,FIFTH BOOK.,"In this bad, twisted, topsy-turvy world,"
6351,FIFTH BOOK.,"Where all the heaviest wrongs get uppermost,—"
6352,FIFTH BOOK.,"In this uneven, unfostering England here,"
6353,FIFTH BOOK.,"Where ledger-strokes and sword-strokes count indeed,"
6354,FIFTH BOOK.,But soul-strokes merely tell upon the flesh
6355,FIFTH BOOK.,"They strike from,—it is hard to stand for art,"
6356,FIFTH BOOK.,Unless some golden tripod from the sea
6357,FIFTH BOOK.,"Be fished up, by Apollo’s divine chance,"
6358,FIFTH BOOK.,"To throne such feet as yours, my prophetess,"
6359,FIFTH BOOK.,"At Delphi. Think,—the god comes down as fierce"
6360,FIFTH BOOK.,"As twenty bloodhounds! shakes you, strangles you,"
6361,FIFTH BOOK.,Until the oracular shriek shall ooze in froth!
6362,FIFTH BOOK.,"At best it’s not all ease,—at worst too hard:"
6363,FIFTH BOOK.,"A place to stand on is a ’vantage gained,"
6364,FIFTH BOOK.,"And here’s your tripod. To be plain, dear friend,"
6365,FIFTH BOOK.,"You’re poor, except in what you richly give;"
6366,FIFTH BOOK.,"You labour for your own bread painfully,"
6367,FIFTH BOOK.,"Or ere you pour our wine. For art’s sake, pause.’"
6368,FIFTH BOOK.,
6369,FIFTH BOOK.,"I answered slow,—as some wayfaring man,"
6370,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who feels himself at night too far from home,"
6371,FIFTH BOOK.,Makes stedfast face against the bitter wind.
6372,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Is art so less a thing than virtue is,"
6373,FIFTH BOOK.,That artists first must cater for their ease
6374,FIFTH BOOK.,Or ever they make issue past themselves
6375,FIFTH BOOK.,"To generous use? alas, and is it so,"
6376,FIFTH BOOK.,"That we, who would be somewhat clean, must sweep"
6377,FIFTH BOOK.,"Our ways as well as walk them, and no friend"
6378,FIFTH BOOK.,"Confirm us nobly,—‘Leave results to God,"
6379,FIFTH BOOK.,"But you, be clean?’ What! ‘prudent compromise"
6380,FIFTH BOOK.,"Makes acceptable life,’ you say instead,"
6381,FIFTH BOOK.,"You, you, Lord Howe?—in things indifferent, well."
6382,FIFTH BOOK.,"For instance, compromise the wheaten bread"
6383,FIFTH BOOK.,"For rye, the meat for lentils, silk for serge,"
6384,FIFTH BOOK.,"And sleep on down, if needs, for sleep on straw;"
6385,FIFTH BOOK.,"But there, end compromise. I will not bate"
6386,FIFTH BOOK.,"One artist-dream, on straw or down, my lord,"
6387,FIFTH BOOK.,"Nor pinch my liberal soul, though I be poor,"
6388,FIFTH BOOK.,"Nor cease to love high, though I live thus low.’"
6389,FIFTH BOOK.,
6390,FIFTH BOOK.,"So speaking, with less anger in my voice"
6391,FIFTH BOOK.,"Than sorrow, I rose quickly to depart;"
6392,FIFTH BOOK.,"While he, thrown back upon the noble shame"
6393,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of such high-stumbling natures, murmured words,"
6394,FIFTH BOOK.,"The right words after wrong ones. Ah, the man"
6395,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is worthy, but so given to entertain"
6396,FIFTH BOOK.,"Impossible plans of superhuman life,—"
6397,FIFTH BOOK.,"He sets his virtues on so raised a shelf,"
6398,FIFTH BOOK.,"To keep them at the grand millennial height,"
6399,FIFTH BOOK.,He has to mount a stool to get at them;
6400,FIFTH BOOK.,"And, meantime, lives on quite the common way,"
6401,FIFTH BOOK.,With everybody’s morals.
6402,FIFTH BOOK.,"As we passed,"
6403,FIFTH BOOK.,Lord Howe insisting that his friendly arm
6404,FIFTH BOOK.,Should oar me across the sparkling brawling stream
6405,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which swept from room to room,—we fell at once"
6406,FIFTH BOOK.,"On Lady Waldemar. ‘Miss Leigh,’ she said,"
6407,FIFTH BOOK.,"And gave me such a smile, so cold and bright,"
6408,FIFTH BOOK.,As if she tried it in a ‘tiring glass
6409,FIFTH BOOK.,"And liked it; ‘all to-night I’ve strained at you,"
6410,FIFTH BOOK.,As babes at baubles held up out of reach
6411,FIFTH BOOK.,"By spiteful nurses, (‘Never snatch,’ they say,)"
6412,FIFTH BOOK.,"And there you sate, most perfectly shut in"
6413,FIFTH BOOK.,"By good Sir Blaise and clever Mister Smith,"
6414,FIFTH BOOK.,"And then our dear Lord Howe! at last, indeed,"
6415,FIFTH BOOK.,I almost snatched. I have a world to speak
6416,FIFTH BOOK.,"About your cousin’s place in Shropshire, where"
6417,FIFTH BOOK.,"I’ve been to see his work ... our work,—you heard"
6418,FIFTH BOOK.,"I went?... and of a letter, yesterday,"
6419,FIFTH BOOK.,"In which, if I should read a page or two,"
6420,FIFTH BOOK.,"You might feel interest, though you’re locked of course"
6421,FIFTH BOOK.,In literary toil.—You’ll like to hear
6422,FIFTH BOOK.,"Your last book lies at the phalanstery,"
6423,FIFTH BOOK.,As judged innocuous for the elder girls
6424,FIFTH BOOK.,And younger women who still care for books.
6425,FIFTH BOOK.,"We all must read, you see, before we live:"
6426,FIFTH BOOK.,"But slowly the ineffable light comes up,"
6427,FIFTH BOOK.,"And, as it deepens, drowns the written word,—"
6428,FIFTH BOOK.,"So said your cousin, while we stood and felt"
6429,FIFTH BOOK.,A sunset from his favourite beech-tree seat:
6430,FIFTH BOOK.,"He might have been a poet if he would,"
6431,FIFTH BOOK.,"But then he saw the higher thing at once,"
6432,FIFTH BOOK.,"And climbed to it. I think he looks well now,"
6433,FIFTH BOOK.,Has quite got over that unfortunate ...
6434,FIFTH BOOK.,"Ah, ah ... I know it moved you. Tender-heart!"
6435,FIFTH BOOK.,You took a liking to the wretched girl.
6436,FIFTH BOOK.,"Perhaps you thought the marriage suitable,"
6437,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who knows? a poet hankers for romance,"
6438,FIFTH BOOK.,"And so on. As for Romney Leigh, ’tis sure"
6439,FIFTH BOOK.,"He never loved her,—never. By the way,"
6440,FIFTH BOOK.,"You have not heard of _her_ ...? quite out of sight,"
6441,FIFTH BOOK.,And out of saving? lost in every sense?’
6442,FIFTH BOOK.,
6443,FIFTH BOOK.,"She might have gone on talking half-an-hour,"
6444,FIFTH BOOK.,"And I stood still, and cold, and pale, I think,"
6445,FIFTH BOOK.,As a garden-statue a child pelts with snow
6446,FIFTH BOOK.,For pretty pastime. Every now and then
6447,FIFTH BOOK.,"I put in ‘yes’ or ‘no,’ I scarce knew why;"
6448,FIFTH BOOK.,"The blind man walks wherever the dog pulls,"
6449,FIFTH BOOK.,And so I answered. Till Lord Howe broke in;
6450,FIFTH BOOK.,‘What penance takes the wretch who interrupts
6451,FIFTH BOOK.,"The talk of charming women? I, at last,"
6452,FIFTH BOOK.,"Must brave it. Pardon, Lady Waldemar!"
6453,FIFTH BOOK.,"The lady on my arm is tired, unwell,"
6454,FIFTH BOOK.,And loyally I’ve promised she shall say
6455,FIFTH BOOK.,"No harder word this evening, than ... goodnight;"
6456,FIFTH BOOK.,The rest her face speaks for her.’—Then we went.
6457,FIFTH BOOK.,
6458,FIFTH BOOK.,"And I breathe large at home. I drop my cloak,"
6459,FIFTH BOOK.,"Unclasp my girdle, loose the band that ties"
6460,FIFTH BOOK.,My hair ... now could I but unloose my soul!
6461,FIFTH BOOK.,"We are sepulchred alive in this close world,"
6462,FIFTH BOOK.,And want more room.
6463,FIFTH BOOK.,The charming woman there—
6464,FIFTH BOOK.,This reckoning up and writing down her talk
6465,FIFTH BOOK.,Affects me singularly. How she talked
6466,FIFTH BOOK.,To pain me! woman’s spite!—You wear steel-mail;
6467,FIFTH BOOK.,"A woman takes a housewife from her breast,"
6468,FIFTH BOOK.,And plucks the delicatest needle out
6469,FIFTH BOOK.,"As ’twere a rose, and pricks you carefully"
6470,FIFTH BOOK.,"’Neath nails, ’neath eyelids, in your nostrils,—say,"
6471,FIFTH BOOK.,"A beast would roar so tortured,—but a man,"
6472,FIFTH BOOK.,"A human creature, must not, shall not flinch,"
6473,FIFTH BOOK.,"No, not for shame."
6474,FIFTH BOOK.,"What vexes, after all,"
6475,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is just that such as she, with such as I,"
6476,FIFTH BOOK.,"Knows how to vex. Sweet heaven, she takes me up"
6477,FIFTH BOOK.,As if she had fingered me and dog-eared me
6478,FIFTH BOOK.,"And spelled me by the fireside, half a life!"
6479,FIFTH BOOK.,"She knows my turns, my feeble points.—What then?"
6480,FIFTH BOOK.,The knowledge of a thing implies the thing;
6481,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of course, she found _that_ in me, she saw _that_,"
6482,FIFTH BOOK.,"Her pencil underscored _this_ for a fault,"
6483,FIFTH BOOK.,"And I, still ignorant. Shut the book up! close!"
6484,FIFTH BOOK.,And crush that beetle in the leaves.
6485,FIFTH BOOK.,"O heart,"
6486,FIFTH BOOK.,"At last we shall grow hard too, like the rest,"
6487,FIFTH BOOK.,And call it self-defence because we are soft.
6488,FIFTH BOOK.,
6489,FIFTH BOOK.,"And after all, now, ... why should I be pained,"
6490,FIFTH BOOK.,"That Romney Leigh, my cousin, should espouse"
6491,FIFTH BOOK.,"This Lady Waldemar? And, say, she held"
6492,FIFTH BOOK.,"Her newly-blossomed gladness in my face, ..."
6493,FIFTH BOOK.,"’Twas natural surely, if not generous,"
6494,FIFTH BOOK.,"Considering how, when winter held her fast,"
6495,FIFTH BOOK.,"I helped the frost with mine, and pained her more"
6496,FIFTH BOOK.,Than she pains me. Pains me!—but wherefore pained?
6497,FIFTH BOOK.,"’Tis clear my cousin Romney wants a wife,—"
6498,FIFTH BOOK.,"So, good!—The man’s need of the woman, here,"
6499,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is greater than the woman’s of the man,"
6500,FIFTH BOOK.,And easier served; for where the man discerns
6501,FIFTH BOOK.,"A sex, (ah, ah, the man can generalise,"
6502,FIFTH BOOK.,"Said he) we see but one, ideally"
6503,FIFTH BOOK.,And really: where we yearn to lose ourselves
6504,FIFTH BOOK.,"And melt like white pearls in another’s wine,"
6505,FIFTH BOOK.,"He seeks to double himself by what he loves,"
6506,FIFTH BOOK.,And make his drink more costly by our pearls.
6507,FIFTH BOOK.,"At board, at bed, at work, and holiday,"
6508,FIFTH BOOK.,"It is not good for man to be alone,—"
6509,FIFTH BOOK.,"And that’s his way of thinking, first and last;"
6510,FIFTH BOOK.,And thus my cousin Romney wants a wife.
6511,FIFTH BOOK.,
6512,FIFTH BOOK.,But then my cousin sets his dignity
6513,FIFTH BOOK.,On personal virtue. If he understands
6514,FIFTH BOOK.,"By love, like others, self-aggrandisement,"
6515,FIFTH BOOK.,It is that he may verily be great
6516,FIFTH BOOK.,"By doing rightly and kindly. Once he thought,"
6517,FIFTH BOOK.,For charitable ends set duly forth
6518,FIFTH BOOK.,"In Heaven’s white judgment-book, to marry ... ah,"
6519,FIFTH BOOK.,"We’ll call her name Aurora Leigh, although"
6520,FIFTH BOOK.,"She’s changed since then!—and once, for social ends,"
6521,FIFTH BOOK.,"Poor Marian Erle, my sister Marian Erle,"
6522,FIFTH BOOK.,"My woodland sister, sweet maid Marian,"
6523,FIFTH BOOK.,Whose memory moans on in me like the wind
6524,FIFTH BOOK.,"Through ill-shut casements, making me more sad"
6525,FIFTH BOOK.,"Than ever I find reasons for. Alas,"
6526,FIFTH BOOK.,"Poor pretty plaintive face, embodied ghost,"
6527,FIFTH BOOK.,"He finds it easy, then, to clap thee off"
6528,FIFTH BOOK.,"From pulling at his sleeve and book and pen,—"
6529,FIFTH BOOK.,"He locks thee out at night into the cold,"
6530,FIFTH BOOK.,Away from butting with thy horny eyes
6531,FIFTH BOOK.,"Against his crystal dreams,—that, now, he’s strong"
6532,FIFTH BOOK.,To love anew? that Lady Waldemar
6533,FIFTH BOOK.,Succeeds my Marian?
6534,FIFTH BOOK.,"After all, why not?"
6535,FIFTH BOOK.,"He loved not Marian, more than once he loved"
6536,FIFTH BOOK.,"Aurora. If he loves, at last, that Third,"
6537,FIFTH BOOK.,Albeit she prove as slippery as spilt oil
6538,FIFTH BOOK.,"On marble floors, I will not augur him"
6539,FIFTH BOOK.,"Ill luck for that. Good love, howe’er ill-placed,"
6540,FIFTH BOOK.,"Is better for a man’s soul in the end,"
6541,FIFTH BOOK.,Than if he loved ill what deserves love well.
6542,FIFTH BOOK.,"A pagan, kissing, for a step of Pan,"
6543,FIFTH BOOK.,"The wild-goat’s hoof-print on the loamy down,"
6544,FIFTH BOOK.,Exceeds our modern thinker who turns back
6545,FIFTH BOOK.,"The strata ... granite, limestone, coal, and clay,"
6546,FIFTH BOOK.,"Concluding coldly with, ‘Here’s law! Where’s God?’"
6547,FIFTH BOOK.,
6548,FIFTH BOOK.,"And then at worse,—if Romney loves her not,—"
6549,FIFTH BOOK.,"At worst,—if he’s incapable of love,"
6550,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which may be—then indeed, for such a man"
6551,FIFTH BOOK.,"Incapable of love, she’s good enough;"
6552,FIFTH BOOK.,"For she, at worst too, is a woman still"
6553,FIFTH BOOK.,And loves him ... as the sort of woman can.
6554,FIFTH BOOK.,
6555,FIFTH BOOK.,"My loose long hair began to burn and creep,"
6556,FIFTH BOOK.,"Alive to the very ends, about my knees:"
6557,FIFTH BOOK.,"I swept it backward as the wind sweeps flame,"
6558,FIFTH BOOK.,"With the passion of my hands. Ah, Romney laughed"
6559,FIFTH BOOK.,One day ... (how full the memories come up!)
6560,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘—Your Florence fire-flies live on in your hair,’"
6561,FIFTH BOOK.,"He said, ‘it gleams so.’ Well, I wrung them out,"
6562,FIFTH BOOK.,"My fire-flies; made a knot as hard as life,"
6563,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of those loose, soft, impracticable curls,"
6564,FIFTH BOOK.,And then sat down and thought.... ‘She shall not think
6565,FIFTH BOOK.,"Her thought of me,’—and drew my desk and wrote."
6566,FIFTH BOOK.,
6567,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘Dear Lady Waldemar, I could not speak"
6568,FIFTH BOOK.,"With people round me, nor can sleep to-night"
6569,FIFTH BOOK.,"And not speak, after the great news I heard"
6570,FIFTH BOOK.,Of you and of my cousin. May you be
6571,FIFTH BOOK.,"Most happy; and the good he meant the world,"
6572,FIFTH BOOK.,"Replenish his own life. Say what I say,"
6573,FIFTH BOOK.,"And let my word be sweeter for your mouth,"
6574,FIFTH BOOK.,As you are _you_ ... I only Aurora Leigh.’
6575,FIFTH BOOK.,
6576,FIFTH BOOK.,"That’s quiet, guarded! though she hold it up"
6577,FIFTH BOOK.,"Against the light, she’ll not see through it more"
6578,FIFTH BOOK.,Than lies there to be seen. So much for pride;
6579,FIFTH BOOK.,"And now for peace, a little! Let me stop"
6580,FIFTH BOOK.,"All writing back.... ‘Sweet thanks, my sweetest friend,"
6581,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘You’ve made more joyful my great joy itself,’"
6582,FIFTH BOOK.,"—No, that’s too simple! she would twist it thus,"
6583,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘My joy would still be as sweet as thyme in drawers,"
6584,FIFTH BOOK.,However shut up in the dark and dry;
6585,FIFTH BOOK.,"But violets, aired and dewed by love like yours,"
6586,FIFTH BOOK.,"Out-smell all thyme! we keep that in our clothes,"
6587,FIFTH BOOK.,"But drop the other down our bosoms, till"
6588,FIFTH BOOK.,"They smell like’ ... ah, I see her writing back"
6589,FIFTH BOOK.,"Just so. She’ll make a nosegay of her words,"
6590,FIFTH BOOK.,And tie it with blue ribbons at the end
6591,FIFTH BOOK.,To suit a poet;—pshaw!
6592,FIFTH BOOK.,And then we’ll have
6593,FIFTH BOOK.,"The call to church; the broken, sad, bad dream"
6594,FIFTH BOOK.,Dreamed out at last; the marriage-vow complete
6595,FIFTH BOOK.,"With the marriage-breakfast; praying in white gloves,"
6596,FIFTH BOOK.,Drawn off in haste for drinking pagan toasts
6597,FIFTH BOOK.,In somewhat stronger wine than any sipped
6598,FIFTH BOOK.,"By gods, since Bacchus had his way with grapes."
6599,FIFTH BOOK.,
6600,FIFTH BOOK.,"A postscript stops all that, and rescues me."
6601,FIFTH BOOK.,"‘You need not write. I have been overworked,"
6602,FIFTH BOOK.,"And think of leaving London, England even,"
6603,FIFTH BOOK.,"And hastening to get nearer to the sun,"
6604,FIFTH BOOK.,"Where men sleep better. So, adieu.’—I fold"
6605,FIFTH BOOK.,"And seal,—— and now I’m out of all the coil;"
6606,FIFTH BOOK.,"I breathe now; I spring upward like a branch,"
6607,FIFTH BOOK.,A ten-years school-boy with a crooked stick
6608,FIFTH BOOK.,"May pull down to his level, in search of nuts,"
6609,FIFTH BOOK.,But cannot hold a moment. How we twang
6610,FIFTH BOOK.,"Back on the blue sky, and assert our height,"
6611,FIFTH BOOK.,"While he stares after! Now, the wonder seems"
6612,FIFTH BOOK.,That I could wrong myself by such a doubt.
6613,FIFTH BOOK.,We poets always have uneasy hearts;
6614,FIFTH BOOK.,"Because our hearts, large-rounded as the globe,"
6615,FIFTH BOOK.,Can turn but one side to the sun at once.
6616,FIFTH BOOK.,We are used to dip our artist-hands in gall
6617,FIFTH BOOK.,"And potash, trying potentialities"
6618,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of alternated colour, till at last"
6619,FIFTH BOOK.,"We get confused, and wonder for our skin"
6620,FIFTH BOOK.,How nature tinged it first. Well—here’s the true
6621,FIFTH BOOK.,"Good flesh-colour; I recognise my hand,—"
6622,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which Romney Leigh may clasp as just a friend’s,"
6623,FIFTH BOOK.,And keep his clean.
6624,FIFTH BOOK.,"And now, my Italy."
6625,FIFTH BOOK.,"Alas, if we could ride with naked souls"
6626,FIFTH BOOK.,"And make no noise and pay no price at all,"
6627,FIFTH BOOK.,"I would have seen thee sooner, Italy,—For"
6628,FIFTH BOOK.,"still I have heard thee crying through my life,"
6629,FIFTH BOOK.,"Thou piercing silence of extatic graves,"
6630,FIFTH BOOK.,Men call that name!
6631,FIFTH BOOK.,
6632,FIFTH BOOK.,"But even a witch, to-day,"
6633,FIFTH BOOK.,Must melt down golden pieces in the nard
6634,FIFTH BOOK.,Wherewith to anoint her broomstick ere she rides;
6635,FIFTH BOOK.,"And poets evermore are scant of gold,"
6636,FIFTH BOOK.,"And, if they find a piece behind the door,"
6637,FIFTH BOOK.,It turns by sunset to a withered leaf.
6638,FIFTH BOOK.,The Devil himself scarce trusts his patented
6639,FIFTH BOOK.,"Gold-making art to any who make rhymes,"
6640,FIFTH BOOK.,But culls his Faustus from philosophers
6641,FIFTH BOOK.,"And not from poets. ‘Leave my Job,’ said God;"
6642,FIFTH BOOK.,"And so, the Devil leaves him without pence,"
6643,FIFTH BOOK.,"And poverty proves, plainly, special grace."
6644,FIFTH BOOK.,"In these new, just, administrative times"
6645,FIFTH BOOK.,Men clamour for an order of merit. Why?
6646,FIFTH BOOK.,"Here’s black bread on the table, and no wine!"
6647,FIFTH BOOK.,At least I am a poet in being poor;
6648,FIFTH BOOK.,Thank God. I wonder if the manuscript
6649,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of my long poem, if ’twere sold outright,"
6650,FIFTH BOOK.,"Would fetch enough to buy me shoes, to go"
6651,FIFTH BOOK.,"A-foot, (thrown in, the necessary patch"
6652,FIFTH BOOK.,For the other side the Alps)? it cannot be:
6653,FIFTH BOOK.,I fear that I must sell this residue
6654,FIFTH BOOK.,Of my father’s books; although the Elzevirs
6655,FIFTH BOOK.,"Have fly-leaves over-written by his hand,"
6656,FIFTH BOOK.,In faded notes as thick and fine and brown
6657,FIFTH BOOK.,As cobwebs on a tawny monument
6658,FIFTH BOOK.,Of the old Greeks—_conferenda hæc cum his_—
6659,FIFTH BOOK.,"_Corruptè citat_—_lege potiùs_,"
6660,FIFTH BOOK.,"And so on, in the scholar’s regal way"
6661,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of giving judgment on the parts of speech,"
6662,FIFTH BOOK.,"As if he sate on all twelve thrones up-piled,"
6663,FIFTH BOOK.,"Arraigning Israel. Ay, but books and notes"
6664,FIFTH BOOK.,"Must go together. And this Proclus too,"
6665,FIFTH BOOK.,"In quaintly dear contracted Grecian types,"
6666,FIFTH BOOK.,"Fantastically crumpled, like his thoughts"
6667,FIFTH BOOK.,Which would not seem too plain; you go round twice
6668,FIFTH BOOK.,"For one step forward, then you take it back,"
6669,FIFTH BOOK.,Because you’re somewhat giddy! there’s the rule
6670,FIFTH BOOK.,"For Proclus. Ah, I stained this middle leaf"
6671,FIFTH BOOK.,"With pressing in’t my Florence iris-bell,"
6672,FIFTH BOOK.,Long stalk and all: my father chided me
6673,FIFTH BOOK.,"For that stain of blue blood,—I recollect"
6674,FIFTH BOOK.,"The peevish turn his voice took,—‘Silly girls,"
6675,FIFTH BOOK.,Who plant their flowers in our philosophy
6676,FIFTH BOOK.,"To make it fine, and only spoil the book!"
6677,FIFTH BOOK.,"No more of it, Aurora.’ Yes—no more!"
6678,FIFTH BOOK.,"Ah, blame of love, that’s sweeter than all praise"
6679,FIFTH BOOK.,"Of those who love not! ’tis so lost to me,"
6680,FIFTH BOOK.,"I cannot, in such beggared life, afford"
6681,FIFTH BOOK.,"To lose my Proclus. Not for Florence, even."
6682,FIFTH BOOK.,
6683,FIFTH BOOK.,"The kissing Judas, Wolff, shall go instead,"
6684,FIFTH BOOK.,Who builds us such a royal book as this
6685,FIFTH BOOK.,"To honour a chief-poet, folio-built,"
6686,FIFTH BOOK.,"And writes above, ‘The house of Nobody:’"
6687,FIFTH BOOK.,"Who floats in cream, as rich as any sucked"
6688,FIFTH BOOK.,"From Juno’s breasts, the broad Homeric lines,"
6689,FIFTH BOOK.,"And, while with their spondaic prodigious mouths"
6690,FIFTH BOOK.,"They lap the lucent margins as babe-gods,"
6691,FIFTH BOOK.,Proclaims them bastards. Wolff’s an atheist;
6692,FIFTH BOOK.,"And if the Iliad fell out, as he says,"
6693,FIFTH BOOK.,"By mere fortuitous concourse of old songs,"
6694,FIFTH BOOK.,"We’ll guess as much, too, for the universe."
6695,FIFTH BOOK.,
6696,FIFTH BOOK.,"That Wolff, those Platos: sweep the upper shelves"
6697,FIFTH BOOK.,"As clean as this, and so I am almost rich,"
6698,FIFTH BOOK.,"Which means, not forced to think of being poor"
6699,FIFTH BOOK.,In sight of ends. To-morrow: no delay.
6700,FIFTH BOOK.,I’ll wait in Paris till good Carrington
6701,FIFTH BOOK.,"Dispose of such, and, having chaffered for"
6702,FIFTH BOOK.,"My book’s price with the publisher, direct"
6703,FIFTH BOOK.,All proceeds to me. Just a line to ask
6704,FIFTH BOOK.,His help.
6705,FIFTH BOOK.,"And now I come, my Italy,"
6706,FIFTH BOOK.,"My own hills! Are you ’ware of me, my hills,"
6707,FIFTH BOOK.,How I burn toward you? do you feel to-night
6708,FIFTH BOOK.,"The urgency and yearning of my soul,"
6709,FIFTH BOOK.,As sleeping mothers feel the sucking babe
6710,FIFTH BOOK.,"And smile?—Nay, not so much as when, in heat,"
6711,FIFTH BOOK.,"Vain lightnings catch at your inviolate tops,"
6712,FIFTH BOOK.,"And tremble while ye are stedfast. Still, ye go"
6713,FIFTH BOOK.,"Your own determined, calm, indifferent way"
6714,FIFTH BOOK.,"Toward sunrise, shade by shade, and light by light;"
6715,FIFTH BOOK.,Of all the grand progression nought left out;

6723,SIXTH BOOK.,
6724,SIXTH BOOK.,
6725,SIXTH BOOK.,THE English have a scornful insular way
6726,SIXTH BOOK.,Of calling the French light. The levity
6727,SIXTH BOOK.,"Is in the judgment only, which yet stands;"
6728,SIXTH BOOK.,"For say a foolish thing but oft enough,"
6729,SIXTH BOOK.,"(And here’s the secret of a hundred creeds,—"

6731,SIXTH BOOK.,By re-iteration chiefly) the same thing
6732,SIXTH BOOK.,"Shall pass at last for absolutely wise,"
6733,SIXTH BOOK.,"And not with fools exclusively. And so,"
6734,SIXTH BOOK.,"We say the French are light, as if we said"
6735,SIXTH BOOK.,"The cat mews, or the milch-cow gives us milk:"
6736,SIXTH BOOK.,"Say rather, cats are milked, and milch-cows mew;"
6737,SIXTH BOOK.,"For what is lightness but inconsequence,"
6738,SIXTH BOOK.,"Vague fluctuation ’twixt effect and cause,"
6739,SIXTH BOOK.,"Compelled by neither? Is a bullet light,"
6740,SIXTH BOOK.,"That dashes from the gun-mouth, while the eye"

6742,SIXTH BOOK.,To a wafer on the white speck on a wall
6743,SIXTH BOOK.,"A hundred paces off? Even so direct,"

6746,SIXTH BOOK.,"All, idealists"

6751,SIXTH BOOK.,"With those too fiery and impatient souls,"
6752,SIXTH BOOK.,They threaten conflagration to the world
6753,SIXTH BOOK.,And rush with most unscrupulous logic on
6754,SIXTH BOOK.,Impossible practice. Set your orators
6755,SIXTH BOOK.,To blow upon them with loud windy mouths
6756,SIXTH BOOK.,"Through watchword phrases, jest or sentiment,"
6757,SIXTH BOOK.,Which drive our burley brutal English mobs
6758,SIXTH BOOK.,"Like so much chaff, whichever way they blow,—"
6759,SIXTH BOOK.,This light French people will not thus be driven.
6760,SIXTH BOOK.,They turn indeed; but then they turn upon
6761,SIXTH BOOK.,"Some central pivot of their thought and choice,"
6762,SIXTH BOOK.,And veer out by the force of holding fast.
6763,SIXTH BOOK.,"—That’s hard to understand, for Englishmen"
6764,SIXTH BOOK.,"Unused to abstract questions, and untrained"
6765,SIXTH BOOK.,"To trace the involutions, valve by valve,"
6766,SIXTH BOOK.,"In each orbed bulb-root of a general truth,"
6767,SIXTH BOOK.,And mark what subtly fine integument

6778,SIXTH BOOK.,
6779,SIXTH BOOK.,"And so I am strong to love this noble France,"

6804,SIXTH BOOK.,A serious riddle: find such anywhere
6805,SIXTH BOOK.,"Except in France; and when it’s found in France,"
6806,SIXTH BOOK.,"Be sure to read it rightly. So, I mused"
6807,SIXTH BOOK.,"Up and down, up and down, the terraced streets,"
6808,SIXTH BOOK.,"The glittering boulevards, the white colonnades"
6809,SIXTH BOOK.,Of fair fantastic Paris who wears boughs
6810,SIXTH BOOK.,"Like plumes, as if man made them,—tossing up"
6811,SIXTH BOOK.,"Her fountains in the sunshine from the squares,"
6812,SIXTH BOOK.,"As dice i’ the game of beauty, sure to win;"
6813,SIXTH BOOK.,"Or as she blew the down-balls of her dreams,"

6816,SIXTH BOOK.,
6817,SIXTH BOOK.,"The city swims in verdure, beautiful"

6819,SIXTH BOOK.,"What bosky gardens, dropped in close-walled courts,"
6820,SIXTH BOOK.,"As plums in ladies’ laps, who start and laugh:"
6821,SIXTH BOOK.,"What miles of streets that run on after trees,"
6822,SIXTH BOOK.,"Still carrying the necessary shops,"
6823,SIXTH BOOK.,"Those open caskets, with the jewels seen!"
6824,SIXTH BOOK.,"And trade is art, and art’s philosophy,"
6825,SIXTH BOOK.,"In Paris. There’s a silk, for instance, there,"
6826,SIXTH BOOK.,"As worth an artist’s study for the folds,"
6827,SIXTH BOOK.,"As that bronze opposite! nay, the bronze has faults;"
6828,SIXTH BOOK.,"Art’s here too artful,—conscious as a maid,"
6829,SIXTH BOOK.,Who leans to mark her shadow on the wall

6831,SIXTH BOOK.,"Yet Art walks forward, and knows where to walk:"
6832,SIXTH BOOK.,"The artists also, are idealists,"
6833,SIXTH BOOK.,"Too absolute for nature, logical"
6834,SIXTH BOOK.,To austerity in the application of
6835,SIXTH BOOK.,The special theory: not a soul content
6836,SIXTH BOOK.,"To paint a crooked pollard and an ass,"
6837,SIXTH BOOK.,"As the English will, because they find it so,"
6838,SIXTH BOOK.,"And like it somehow.—Ah, the old Tuileries"
6839,SIXTH BOOK.,"Is pulling its high cap down on its eyes,"
6840,SIXTH BOOK.,"Confounded, conscience-stricken, and amazed"

6846,SIXTH BOOK.,"By the ghosts perhaps, that blow too bleak this way"

6853,SIXTH BOOK.,"For a nation that runs fast,—ay, runs against"

6915,SIXTH BOOK.,"For that, she will not trust us often with"
6916,SIXTH BOOK.,"Her larger sense of beauty and desire,"
6917,SIXTH BOOK.,But tethers us to a lily or a rose
6918,SIXTH BOOK.,"And bids us diet on the dew inside,—"
6919,SIXTH BOOK.,Left ignorant that the hungry beggar-boy
6920,SIXTH BOOK.,"(Who stares unseen against our absent eyes,"
6921,SIXTH BOOK.,"And wonders at the gods that we must be,"
6922,SIXTH BOOK.,To pass so careless for the oranges!)
6923,SIXTH BOOK.,Bears yet a breastful of a fellow-world
6924,SIXTH BOOK.,"To this world, undisparaged, undespoiled,"
6925,SIXTH BOOK.,"And (while we scorn him for a flower or two,"
6926,SIXTH BOOK.,"As being, Heaven help us, less poetical)"
6927,SIXTH BOOK.,"Contains, himself, both flowers and firmaments"
6928,SIXTH BOOK.,"And surging seas and aspectable stars,"
6929,SIXTH BOOK.,And all that we would push him out of sight
6930,SIXTH BOOK.,In order to see nearer. Let us pray
6931,SIXTH BOOK.,God’s grace to keep God’s image in repute;
6932,SIXTH BOOK.,"That so, the poet and philanthropist,"
6933,SIXTH BOOK.,"(Even I and Romney) may stand side by side,"
6934,SIXTH BOOK.,Because we both stand face to face with men
6935,SIXTH BOOK.,"Contemplating the people in the rough,—"
6936,SIXTH BOOK.,"Yet each so follow a vocation,—his"
6937,SIXTH BOOK.,And mine.
6938,SIXTH BOOK.,"I walked on, musing with myself"
6939,SIXTH BOOK.,"On life and art, and whether, after all,"
6940,SIXTH BOOK.,A larger metaphysics might not help
6941,SIXTH BOOK.,"Our physics, a completer poetry"
6942,SIXTH BOOK.,"Adjust our daily life and vulgar wants,"
6943,SIXTH BOOK.,"More fully than the special outside plans,"
6944,SIXTH BOOK.,"Phalansteries, material institutes,"
6945,SIXTH BOOK.,The civil conscriptions and lay monasteries
6946,SIXTH BOOK.,"Preferred by modern thinkers, as they thought"
6947,SIXTH BOOK.,"The bread of man indeed made all his life,"
6948,SIXTH BOOK.,And washing seven times in the ‘People’s Baths’
6949,SIXTH BOOK.,"Were sovereign for a people’s leprosy,—"
6950,SIXTH BOOK.,Still leaving out the essential prophet’s word
6951,SIXTH BOOK.,"That comes in power. On which, we thunder down,"
6952,SIXTH BOOK.,"We prophets, poets,—Virtue’s in the _word_!"
6953,SIXTH BOOK.,"The maker burnt the darkness up with His,"
6954,SIXTH BOOK.,To inaugurate the use of vocal life;
6955,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, plant a poet’s word even, deep enough"
6956,SIXTH BOOK.,"In any man’s breast, looking presently"
6957,SIXTH BOOK.,"For offshoots, you have done more for the man,"
6958,SIXTH BOOK.,Than if you dressed him in a broad-cloth coat
6959,SIXTH BOOK.,And warmed his Sunday potage at your fire.
6960,SIXTH BOOK.,Yet Romney leaves me....
6961,SIXTH BOOK.,God! what face is that?
6962,SIXTH BOOK.,"O Romney, O Marian!"
6963,SIXTH BOOK.,Walking on the quays
6964,SIXTH BOOK.,"And pulling thoughts to pieces leisurely,"
6965,SIXTH BOOK.,"As if I caught at grasses in a field,"
6966,SIXTH BOOK.,"And bit them slow between my absent lips,"
6967,SIXTH BOOK.,And shred them with my hands....
6968,SIXTH BOOK.,What face is that?
6969,SIXTH BOOK.,"What a face, what a look, what a likeness! Full on mine"
6970,SIXTH BOOK.,"The sudden blow of it came down, till all"
6971,SIXTH BOOK.,"My blood swam, my eyes dazzled. Then I sprang—"
6972,SIXTH BOOK.,
6973,SIXTH BOOK.,It was as if a meditative man
6974,SIXTH BOOK.,Were dreaming out a summer afternoon
6975,SIXTH BOOK.,"And watching gnats a-prick upon a pond,"
6976,SIXTH BOOK.,"When something floats up suddenly, out there,"
6977,SIXTH BOOK.,"Turns over ... a dead face, known once alive—"
6978,SIXTH BOOK.,"So old, so new! It would be dreadful now"
6979,SIXTH BOOK.,To lose the sight and keep the doubt of this.
6980,SIXTH BOOK.,He plunges—ha! he has lost it in the splash.
6981,SIXTH BOOK.,
6982,SIXTH BOOK.,"I plunged—I tore the crowd up, either side,"
6983,SIXTH BOOK.,"And rushed on,—forward, forward ... after her."
6984,SIXTH BOOK.,Her? whom?
6985,SIXTH BOOK.,"A woman sauntered slow, in front,"
6986,SIXTH BOOK.,"Munching an apple,—she left off amazed"
6987,SIXTH BOOK.,"As if I had snatched it: that’s not she, at least."
6988,SIXTH BOOK.,"A man walked arm-linked with a lady veiled,"
6989,SIXTH BOOK.,Both heads dropped closer than the need of talk:
6990,SIXTH BOOK.,"They started; he forgot her with his face,"
6991,SIXTH BOOK.,"And she, herself,—and clung to him as if"
6992,SIXTH BOOK.,"My look were fatal. Such a stream of folk,"
6993,SIXTH BOOK.,And all with cares and business of their own!
6994,SIXTH BOOK.,I ran the whole quay down against their eyes;
6995,SIXTH BOOK.,"No Marian; nowhere Marian. Almost, now,"
6996,SIXTH BOOK.,"I could call Marian, Marian, with the shriek"
6997,SIXTH BOOK.,Of desperate creatures calling for the Dead.
6998,SIXTH BOOK.,"Where is she, was she? was she anywhere?"
6999,SIXTH BOOK.,"I stood still, breathless, gazing, straining out"
7000,SIXTH BOOK.,"In every uncertain distance, till, at last,"
7001,SIXTH BOOK.,A gentleman abstracted as myself
7002,SIXTH BOOK.,"Came full against me, then resolved the clash"
7003,SIXTH BOOK.,"In voluble excuses,—obviously"
7004,SIXTH BOOK.,Some learned member of the Institute
7005,SIXTH BOOK.,"Upon his way there, walking, for his health,"
7006,SIXTH BOOK.,While meditating on the last ‘Discourse;’
7007,SIXTH BOOK.,"Pinching the empty air ’twixt finger and thumb,"
7008,SIXTH BOOK.,"From which the snuff being ousted by that shock,"
7009,SIXTH BOOK.,"Defiled his snow-white waistcoat, duly pricked"
7010,SIXTH BOOK.,At the button-hole with honourable red;
7011,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Madame, your pardon,’—there, he swerved from me"
7012,SIXTH BOOK.,"A metre, as confounded as he had heard"
7013,SIXTH BOOK.,That Dumas would be chosen to fill up
7014,SIXTH BOOK.,"The next chair vacant, by his ‘men _in us_.’"
7015,SIXTH BOOK.,Since when was genius found respectable?
7016,SIXTH BOOK.,"It passes in its place, indeed,—which means"
7017,SIXTH BOOK.,"The seventh floor back, or else the hospital:"
7018,SIXTH BOOK.,"Revolving pistols are ingenious things,"
7019,SIXTH BOOK.,But prudent men (Academicians are)
7020,SIXTH BOOK.,"Scarce keep them in the cupboard, next the prunes."
7021,SIXTH BOOK.,
7022,SIXTH BOOK.,"And so, abandoned to a bitter mirth,"
7023,SIXTH BOOK.,"I loitered to my inn. O world, O world,"
7024,SIXTH BOOK.,"O jurists, rhymers, dreamers, what you please,"
7025,SIXTH BOOK.,We play a weary game of hide-and-seek!
7026,SIXTH BOOK.,"We shape a figure of our fantasy,"
7027,SIXTH BOOK.,"Call nothing something, and run after it"
7028,SIXTH BOOK.,"And lose it, lose ourselves too in the search;"
7029,SIXTH BOOK.,"Till, clash against us, comes a somebody"
7030,SIXTH BOOK.,"Who also has lost something and is lost,"
7031,SIXTH BOOK.,"Philosopher against philanthropist,"
7032,SIXTH BOOK.,"Academician against poet, man"
7033,SIXTH BOOK.,"Against woman, against the living, the dead,—"
7034,SIXTH BOOK.,"Then home, with a bad headache and worse jest!"
7035,SIXTH BOOK.,
7036,SIXTH BOOK.,To change the water for my heliotropes
7037,SIXTH BOOK.,And yellow roses. Paris has such flowers.
7038,SIXTH BOOK.,"But England, also. ’Twas a yellow rose,"
7039,SIXTH BOOK.,"By that south window of the little house,"
7040,SIXTH BOOK.,My cousin Romney gathered with his hand
7041,SIXTH BOOK.,"On all my birthdays for me, save the last;"
7042,SIXTH BOOK.,"And then I shook the tree too rough, too rough,"
7043,SIXTH BOOK.,For roses to stay after.
7044,SIXTH BOOK.,"Now, my maps."
7045,SIXTH BOOK.,I must not linger here from Italy
7046,SIXTH BOOK.,"Till the last nightingale is tired of song,"
7047,SIXTH BOOK.,And the last fire-fly dies off in the maize.
7048,SIXTH BOOK.,My soul’s in haste to leap into the sun
7049,SIXTH BOOK.,"And scorch and seethe itself to a finer mood,"
7050,SIXTH BOOK.,"Which here, in this chill north, is apt to stand"
7051,SIXTH BOOK.,Too stiffly in former moulds.
7052,SIXTH BOOK.,That-face persists.
7053,SIXTH BOOK.,"It floats up, it turns over in my mind,"
7054,SIXTH BOOK.,"As like to Marian, as one dead is like"
7055,SIXTH BOOK.,The same alive. In very deed a face
7056,SIXTH BOOK.,"And not a fancy, though it vanished so;"
7057,SIXTH BOOK.,"The small fair face between the darks of hair,"
7058,SIXTH BOOK.,"I used to liken, when I saw her first,"
7059,SIXTH BOOK.,"To a point of moonlit, water down a well:"
7060,SIXTH BOOK.,"The low brow, the frank space between the eyes,"
7061,SIXTH BOOK.,Which always had the brown pathetic look
7062,SIXTH BOOK.,"Of a dumb creature who had been beaten once,"
7063,SIXTH BOOK.,And never since was easy with the world.
7064,SIXTH BOOK.,"Ah, ah—now I remember perfectly"
7065,SIXTH BOOK.,"Those eyes, to-day,—how overlarge they seemed,"
7066,SIXTH BOOK.,As if some patient passionate despair
7067,SIXTH BOOK.,"(Like a coal dropt and forgot on tapestry,"
7068,SIXTH BOOK.,Which slowly burns a widening circle out)
7069,SIXTH BOOK.,"Had burnt them larger, larger. And those eyes"
7070,SIXTH BOOK.,"To-day, I do remember, saw me too,"
7071,SIXTH BOOK.,"As I saw them, with conscious lids astrain"
7072,SIXTH BOOK.,"In recognition. Now, a fantasy,"
7073,SIXTH BOOK.,"A simple shade or image of the brain,"
7074,SIXTH BOOK.,"Is merely passive, does not retro-act,"
7075,SIXTH BOOK.,"Is seen, but sees not."
7076,SIXTH BOOK.,"’Twas a real face,"
7077,SIXTH BOOK.,Perhaps a real Marian.
7078,SIXTH BOOK.,"Which being so,"
7079,SIXTH BOOK.,"I ought to write to Romney, ‘Marian’s here."
7080,SIXTH BOOK.,Be comforted for Marian.’
7081,SIXTH BOOK.,"My pen fell,"
7082,SIXTH BOOK.,"My hands struck sharp together, as hands do"
7083,SIXTH BOOK.,Which hold at nothing. Can I write to _him_
7084,SIXTH BOOK.,A half truth? can I keep my own soul blind
7085,SIXTH BOOK.,"To the other half, ... the worse? What are our souls,"
7086,SIXTH BOOK.,"If still, to run on straight a sober pace"
7087,SIXTH BOOK.,"Nor start at every pebble or dead leaf,"
7088,SIXTH BOOK.,"They must wear blinkers, ignore facts, suppress"
7089,SIXTH BOOK.,"Six tenths of the road? Confront the truth, my soul!"
7090,SIXTH BOOK.,"And oh, as truly as that was Marian’s face,"
7091,SIXTH BOOK.,The arms of that same Marian clasped a thing
7092,SIXTH BOOK.,"... Not hid so well beneath the scanty shawl,"
7093,SIXTH BOOK.,I cannot name it now for what it was.
7094,SIXTH BOOK.,
7095,SIXTH BOOK.,A child. Small business has a cast-away
7096,SIXTH BOOK.,"Like Marian, with that crown of prosperous wives,"
7097,SIXTH BOOK.,At which the gentlest she grows arrogant
7098,SIXTH BOOK.,"And says, ‘my child.’ Who’ll find an emerald ring"
7099,SIXTH BOOK.,"On a beggar’s middle finger, and require"
7100,SIXTH BOOK.,More testimony to convict a thief?
7101,SIXTH BOOK.,A child’s too costly for so mere a wretch;
7102,SIXTH BOOK.,"She filched it somewhere; and it means, with her,"
7103,SIXTH BOOK.,"Instead of honour, blessing, ... merely shame."
7104,SIXTH BOOK.,"I cannot write to Romney, ‘Here she is,"
7105,SIXTH BOOK.,Here’s Marian found! I’ll set you on her track:
7106,SIXTH BOOK.,"I saw her here, in Paris, ... and her child."
7107,SIXTH BOOK.,"She put away your love two years ago,"
7108,SIXTH BOOK.,"But, plainly, not to starve. You suffered then;"
7109,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, now that you’ve forgot her utterly"
7110,SIXTH BOOK.,"As any last year’s annual, in whose place"
7111,SIXTH BOOK.,"You’ve planted a thick flowering evergreen,"
7112,SIXTH BOOK.,"I choose, being kind, to write and tell you this"
7113,SIXTH BOOK.,"To make you wholly easy—she’s not dead,"
7114,SIXTH BOOK.,But only ... damned.’
7115,SIXTH BOOK.,Stop there: I go too fast;
7116,SIXTH BOOK.,"I’m cruel like the rest,—in haste to take"
7117,SIXTH BOOK.,"The first stir in the arras for a rat,"
7118,SIXTH BOOK.,"And set my barking, biting thoughts upon’t."
7119,SIXTH BOOK.,—A child! what then? Suppose a neighbour’s sick
7120,SIXTH BOOK.,"And asked her, ‘Marian, carry out my child"
7121,SIXTH BOOK.,"In this Spring air,’—I punish her for that?"
7122,SIXTH BOOK.,"Or say, the child should hold her round the neck"
7123,SIXTH BOOK.,"For good child-reasons, that he liked it so"
7124,SIXTH BOOK.,And would not leave her—she had winning ways—
7125,SIXTH BOOK.,"I brand her therefore, that she took the child?"
7126,SIXTH BOOK.,Not so.
7127,SIXTH BOOK.,I will not write to Romney Leigh.
7128,SIXTH BOOK.,"For now he’s happy,—and she may indeed"
7129,SIXTH BOOK.,"Be guilty,—and the knowledge of her fault"
7130,SIXTH BOOK.,"Would draggle his smooth time. But I, whose days"
7131,SIXTH BOOK.,"Are not so fine they cannot bear the rain,"
7132,SIXTH BOOK.,"And who, moreover, having seen her face,"
7133,SIXTH BOOK.,"Must see it again, ... _will_ see it, by my hopes"
7134,SIXTH BOOK.,Of one day seeing heaven too. The police
7135,SIXTH BOOK.,"Shall track her, hound her, ferret their own soil;"
7136,SIXTH BOOK.,We’ll dig this Paris to its catacombs
7137,SIXTH BOOK.,"But certainly we’ll find her, have her out,"
7138,SIXTH BOOK.,"And save her, if she will or will not—child"
7139,SIXTH BOOK.,"Or no child,—if a child, then one to save!"
7140,SIXTH BOOK.,
7141,SIXTH BOOK.,The long weeks passed on without consequence.
7142,SIXTH BOOK.,As easy find a footstep on the sand
7143,SIXTH BOOK.,"The morning after spring-tide, as the trace"
7144,SIXTH BOOK.,Of Marian’s feet between the incessant surfs
7145,SIXTH BOOK.,"Of this live flood. She may have moved this way,—"
7146,SIXTH BOOK.,"But so the star-fish does, and crosses out"
7147,SIXTH BOOK.,The dent of her small shoe. The foiled police
7148,SIXTH BOOK.,"Renounced me; ‘Could they find a girl and child,"
7149,SIXTH BOOK.,No other signalment but girl and child?
7150,SIXTH BOOK.,"No data shown, but noticeable eyes"
7151,SIXTH BOOK.,"And hair in masses, low upon the brow,"
7152,SIXTH BOOK.,As if it were an iron crown and pressed?
7153,SIXTH BOOK.,"Friends heighten, and suppose they specify:"
7154,SIXTH BOOK.,"Why, girls with hair and eyes, are everywhere"
7155,SIXTH BOOK.,In Paris; they had turned me up in vain
7156,SIXTH BOOK.,"No Marian Erle indeed, but certainly"
7157,SIXTH BOOK.,"Mathildes, Justines, Victoires, ... or, if I sought"
7158,SIXTH BOOK.,"The English, Betsies, Saras, by the score."
7159,SIXTH BOOK.,They might as well go out into the fields
7160,SIXTH BOOK.,"To find a speckled bean, that’s somehow specked,"
7161,SIXTH BOOK.,And somewhere in the pod.’—They left me so.
7162,SIXTH BOOK.,Shall _I_ leave Marian? have I dreamed a dream?
7163,SIXTH BOOK.,—I thank God I have found her! I must say
7164,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Thank God,’ for finding her, although ’tis true"
7165,SIXTH BOOK.,I find the world more sad and wicked for’t.
7166,SIXTH BOOK.,But she—
7167,SIXTH BOOK.,"I’ll write about her, presently;"
7168,SIXTH BOOK.,My hand’s a-tremble as I had just caught up
7169,SIXTH BOOK.,"My heart to write with, in the place of it."
7170,SIXTH BOOK.,At least you’d take these letters to be writ
7171,SIXTH BOOK.,"At sea, in storm!—wait now...."
7172,SIXTH BOOK.,A simple chance
7173,SIXTH BOOK.,"Did all. I could not sleep last night, and, tired"
7174,SIXTH BOOK.,"Of turning on my pillow and harder thoughts,"
7175,SIXTH BOOK.,"Went out at early morning, when the air"
7176,SIXTH BOOK.,"Is delicate with some last starry touch,"
7177,SIXTH BOOK.,To wander through the Market-place of Flowers
7178,SIXTH BOOK.,"(The prettiest haunt in Paris), and make sure"
7179,SIXTH BOOK.,"At worst, that there were roses in the world."
7180,SIXTH BOOK.,"So, wandering, musing, with the artist’s eye,"
7181,SIXTH BOOK.,"That keeps the shade-side of the thing it loves,"
7182,SIXTH BOOK.,"Half-absent, whole-observing, while the crowd"
7183,SIXTH BOOK.,Of young vivacious and black-braided heads
7184,SIXTH BOOK.,"Dipped, quick as finches in a blossomed tree,"
7185,SIXTH BOOK.,"Among the nosegays, cheapening this and that"
7186,SIXTH BOOK.,"In such a cheerful twitter of rapid speech,—"
7187,SIXTH BOOK.,"My heart leapt in me, startled by a voice"
7188,SIXTH BOOK.,"That slowly, faintly, with long breaths that marked"
7189,SIXTH BOOK.,"The interval between the wish and word,"
7190,SIXTH BOOK.,"Inquired in stranger’s French, ‘Would _that_ be much,"
7191,SIXTH BOOK.,That branch of flowering mountain-gorse?’—‘So much?
7192,SIXTH BOOK.,"Too much for me, then!’ turning the face round"
7193,SIXTH BOOK.,"So close upon me, that I felt the sigh"
7194,SIXTH BOOK.,It turned with.
7195,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Marian, Marian!’—face to face—"
7196,SIXTH BOOK.,‘Marian! I find you. Shall I let you go?’
7197,SIXTH BOOK.,I held her two slight wrists with both my hands;
7198,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Ah Marian, Marian, can I let you go?’"
7199,SIXTH BOOK.,"—She fluttered from me like a cyclamen,"
7200,SIXTH BOOK.,"As white, which, taken in a sudden wind,"
7201,SIXTH BOOK.,"Beats on against the palisade.—‘Let pass,’"
7202,SIXTH BOOK.,"She said at last. ‘I will not,’ I replied;"
7203,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘I lost my sister Marian many days,"
7204,SIXTH BOOK.,"And sought her ever in my walks and prayers,"
7205,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, now I find her ... do we throw away"
7206,SIXTH BOOK.,"The bread we worked and prayed for,—crumble it"
7207,SIXTH BOOK.,"And drop it, ... to do even so by thee"
7208,SIXTH BOOK.,"Whom still I’ve hungered after more than bread,"
7209,SIXTH BOOK.,"My sister Marian?—can I hurt thee, dear?"
7210,SIXTH BOOK.,Then why distrust me? Never tremble so.
7211,SIXTH BOOK.,"Come with me rather, where we’ll talk and live,"
7212,SIXTH BOOK.,And none shall vex us. I’ve a home for you
7213,SIXTH BOOK.,And me and no one else’....
7214,SIXTH BOOK.,She shook her head.
7215,SIXTH BOOK.,‘A home for you and me and no one else
7216,SIXTH BOOK.,"Ill-suits one of us: I prefer to such,"
7217,SIXTH BOOK.,"A roof of grass on which a flower might spring,"
7218,SIXTH BOOK.,Less costly to me than the cheapest here;
7219,SIXTH BOOK.,"And yet I could not, at this hour, afford"
7220,SIXTH BOOK.,"A like home, even. That you offer yours,"
7221,SIXTH BOOK.,I thank you. You are good as heaven itself—
7222,SIXTH BOOK.,As good as one I knew before.... Farewell.’
7223,SIXTH BOOK.,"I loosed her hands.—‘In _his_ name, no farewell!’"
7224,SIXTH BOOK.,"(She stood as if I held her.) ‘For his sake,"
7225,SIXTH BOOK.,"For his sake, Romney’s! by the good he meant,"
7226,SIXTH BOOK.,"Ay, always! by the love he pressed for once,—"
7227,SIXTH BOOK.,"And by the grief, reproach, abandonment,"
7228,SIXTH BOOK.,He took in change’....
7229,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘He, Romney! who grieved _him_?"
7230,SIXTH BOOK.,Who had the heart for’t? what reproach touched _him_?
7231,SIXTH BOOK.,"Be merciful,—speak quickly.’"
7232,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Therefore come,’"
7233,SIXTH BOOK.,"I answered with authority,—‘I think"
7234,SIXTH BOOK.,"We dare to speak such things, and name such names,"
7235,SIXTH BOOK.,In the open squares of Paris!’
7236,SIXTH BOOK.,Not a word
7237,SIXTH BOOK.,"She said, but, in a gentle humbled way,"
7238,SIXTH BOOK.,(As one who had forgot herself in grief)
7239,SIXTH BOOK.,"Turned round and followed closely where I went,"
7240,SIXTH BOOK.,"As if I led her by a narrow plank,"
7241,SIXTH BOOK.,"Across devouring waters, step by step,—"
7242,SIXTH BOOK.,And so in silence we walked on a mile.
7243,SIXTH BOOK.,
7244,SIXTH BOOK.,And then she stopped: her face was white as wax.
7245,SIXTH BOOK.,‘We go much farther?’
7246,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘You are ill,’ I asked,"
7247,SIXTH BOOK.,‘Or tired?’
7248,SIXTH BOOK.,She looked the whiter for her smile.
7249,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘There’s one at home,’ she said, ‘has need of me"
7250,SIXTH BOOK.,"By this time,—and I must not let him wait.’"
7251,SIXTH BOOK.,
7252,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Not even,’ I asked, ‘to hear of Romney Leigh?’"
7253,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Not even,’ she said, ‘to hear of Mister Leigh.’"
7254,SIXTH BOOK.,
7255,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘In that case,’ I resumed, ‘I go with you,"
7256,SIXTH BOOK.,And we can talk the same thing there as here.
7257,SIXTH BOOK.,None waits for me: I have my day to spend.’
7258,SIXTH BOOK.,
7259,SIXTH BOOK.,"Her lips moved in a spasm without a sound,—"
7260,SIXTH BOOK.,But then she spoke. ‘It shall be as you please;
7261,SIXTH BOOK.,And better so—’tis shorter seen than told.
7262,SIXTH BOOK.,"And though you will not find me worth your pains,"
7263,SIXTH BOOK.,"_That_ even, may be worth some pains to know,"
7264,SIXTH BOOK.,For one as good as you are.’
7265,SIXTH BOOK.,Then she led
7266,SIXTH BOOK.,"The way, and I, as by a narrow plank"
7267,SIXTH BOOK.,"Across devouring waters, followed her,"
7268,SIXTH BOOK.,"Stepping by her footsteps, breathing by her breath,"
7269,SIXTH BOOK.,And holding her with eyes that would not slip;
7270,SIXTH BOOK.,"And so, without a word, we walked a mile,"
7271,SIXTH BOOK.,"And so, another mile, without a word."
7272,SIXTH BOOK.,
7273,SIXTH BOOK.,"Until the peopled streets being all dismissed,"
7274,SIXTH BOOK.,"House-rows and groups all scattered like a flock,"
7275,SIXTH BOOK.,"The market-gardens thickened, and the long"
7276,SIXTH BOOK.,"White walls beyond, like spiders’ outside threads,"
7277,SIXTH BOOK.,"Stretched, feeling blindly toward the country-fields"
7278,SIXTH BOOK.,Through half-built habitations and half-dug
7279,SIXTH BOOK.,"Foundations,—intervals of trenchant chalk,"
7280,SIXTH BOOK.,That bite betwixt the grassy uneven turfs
7281,SIXTH BOOK.,Where goats (vine-tendrils trailing from their mouths)
7282,SIXTH BOOK.,Stood perched on edges of the cellarage
7283,SIXTH BOOK.,"Which should be, staring as about to leap"
7284,SIXTH BOOK.,To find their coming Bacchus. All the place
7285,SIXTH BOOK.,Seemed less a cultivation than a waste:
7286,SIXTH BOOK.,"Men work here, only,—scarce begin to live:"
7287,SIXTH BOOK.,"All’s sad, the country struggling with the town,"
7288,SIXTH BOOK.,"Like an untamed hawk upon a strong man’s fist,"
7289,SIXTH BOOK.,"That beats its wings and tries to get away,"
7290,SIXTH BOOK.,And cannot choose be satisfied so soon
7291,SIXTH BOOK.,"To hop through court-yards with its right foot tied,"
7292,SIXTH BOOK.,The vintage plains and pastoral hills in sight!
7293,SIXTH BOOK.,
7294,SIXTH BOOK.,We stopped beside a house too high and slim
7295,SIXTH BOOK.,"To stand there by itself, but waiting till"
7296,SIXTH BOOK.,"Five others, two on this side, three on that,"
7297,SIXTH BOOK.,Should grow up from the sullen second floor
7298,SIXTH BOOK.,"They pause at now, to build it to a row."
7299,SIXTH BOOK.,The upper windows partly were unglazed
7300,SIXTH BOOK.,"Meantime,—a meagre, unripe house: a line"
7301,SIXTH BOOK.,"Of rigid poplars elbowed it behind,"
7302,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, just in front, beyond the lime and bricks"
7303,SIXTH BOOK.,"That wronged the grass between it and the road,"
7304,SIXTH BOOK.,"A great acacia, with its slender trunk"
7305,SIXTH BOOK.,"And overpoise of multitudinous leaves,"
7306,SIXTH BOOK.,(In which a hundred fields might spill their dew
7307,SIXTH BOOK.,"And intense verdure, yet find room enough)"
7308,SIXTH BOOK.,"Stood, reconciling all the place with green."
7309,SIXTH BOOK.,
7310,SIXTH BOOK.,I followed up the stair upon her step.
7311,SIXTH BOOK.,"She hurried upward, shot across a face,"
7312,SIXTH BOOK.,"A woman’s on the landing,—‘How now, now!"
7313,SIXTH BOOK.,Is no one to have holidays but you?
7314,SIXTH BOOK.,"You said an hour, and stay three hours, I think,"
7315,SIXTH BOOK.,And Julie waiting for your betters here?
7316,SIXTH BOOK.,"Why if he had waked, he might have waked, for me.’"
7317,SIXTH BOOK.,—Just murmuring an excusing word she passed
7318,SIXTH BOOK.,"And shut the rest out with the chamber-door,"
7319,SIXTH BOOK.,Myself shut in beside her.
7320,SIXTH BOOK.,’Twas a room
7321,SIXTH BOOK.,"Scarce larger than a grave, and near as bare;"
7322,SIXTH BOOK.,"Two stools, a pallet-bed; I saw the room:"
7323,SIXTH BOOK.,"A mouse could find no sort of shelter in’t,"
7324,SIXTH BOOK.,"Much less a greater secret; curtainless,—"
7325,SIXTH BOOK.,"The window fixed you with its torturing eye,"
7326,SIXTH BOOK.,"Defying you to take a step apart,"
7327,SIXTH BOOK.,If peradventure you would hide a thing.
7328,SIXTH BOOK.,"I saw the whole room, I and Marian there"
7329,SIXTH BOOK.,Alone.
7330,SIXTH BOOK.,"Alone? She threw her bonnet off,"
7331,SIXTH BOOK.,"Then sighing as ’twere sighing the last time,"
7332,SIXTH BOOK.,"Approached the bed, and drew a shawl away:"
7333,SIXTH BOOK.,You could not peel a fruit you fear to bruise
7334,SIXTH BOOK.,"More calmly and more carefully than so,—"
7335,SIXTH BOOK.,"Nor would you find within, a rosier flushed"
7336,SIXTH BOOK.,Pomegranate—
7337,SIXTH BOOK.,"There he lay, upon his back,"
7338,SIXTH BOOK.,"The yearling creature, warm and moist with life"
7339,SIXTH BOOK.,"To the bottom of his dimples,—to the ends"
7340,SIXTH BOOK.,Of the lovely tumbled curls about his face;
7341,SIXTH BOOK.,For since he had been covered over-much
7342,SIXTH BOOK.,"To keep him from the light-glare, both his cheeks"
7343,SIXTH BOOK.,Were hot and scarlet as the first live rose
7344,SIXTH BOOK.,"The shepherd’s heart-blood ebbed away into,"
7345,SIXTH BOOK.,The faster for his love. And love was here
7346,SIXTH BOOK.,"As instant! in the pretty baby-mouth,"
7347,SIXTH BOOK.,Shut close as if for dreaming that it sucked;
7348,SIXTH BOOK.,The little naked feet drawn up the way
7349,SIXTH BOOK.,Of nestled birdlings; everything so soft
7350,SIXTH BOOK.,"And tender,—to the little holdfast hands,"
7351,SIXTH BOOK.,"Which, closing on a finger into sleep,"
7352,SIXTH BOOK.,Had kept the mould of’t.
7353,SIXTH BOOK.,"While we stood there dumb,—"
7354,SIXTH BOOK.,"For oh, that it should take such innocence"
7355,SIXTH BOOK.,"To prove just guilt, I thought, and stood there dumb;"
7356,SIXTH BOOK.,"The light upon his eyelids pricked them wide,"
7357,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, staring out at us with all their blue,"
7358,SIXTH BOOK.,As half perplexed between the angelhood
7359,SIXTH BOOK.,"He had been away to visit in his sleep,"
7360,SIXTH BOOK.,"And our most mortal presence,—gradually"
7361,SIXTH BOOK.,"He saw his mother’s face, accepting it"
7362,SIXTH BOOK.,"In change for heaven itself, with such a smile"
7363,SIXTH BOOK.,"As might have well been learnt there,—never moved,"
7364,SIXTH BOOK.,"But smiled on, in a drowse of ecstasy,"
7365,SIXTH BOOK.,So happy (half with her and half with heaven)
7366,SIXTH BOOK.,"He could not have the trouble to be stirred,"
7367,SIXTH BOOK.,"But smiled and lay there. Like a rose, I said:"
7368,SIXTH BOOK.,"As red and still indeed as any rose,"
7369,SIXTH BOOK.,"That blows in all the silence of its leaves,"
7370,SIXTH BOOK.,"Content, in blowing, to fulfil its life."
7371,SIXTH BOOK.,
7372,SIXTH BOOK.,She leaned above him (drinking him as wine)
7373,SIXTH BOOK.,"In that extremity of love, ’twill pass"
7374,SIXTH BOOK.,"For agony or rapture, seeing that love"
7375,SIXTH BOOK.,"Includes the whole of nature, rounding it"
7376,SIXTH BOOK.,"To love ... no more,—since more can never be"
7377,SIXTH BOOK.,"Than just love. Self-forgot, cast out of self,"
7378,SIXTH BOOK.,"And drowning in the transport of the sight,"
7379,SIXTH BOOK.,"Her whole pale passionate face, mouth, forehead, eyes,"
7380,SIXTH BOOK.,"One gaze, she stood! then, slowly as he smiled,"
7381,SIXTH BOOK.,"She smiled too, slowly, smiling unaware,"
7382,SIXTH BOOK.,And drawing from his countenance to hers
7383,SIXTH BOOK.,"A fainter red, as if she watched a flame"
7384,SIXTH BOOK.,"And stood in it a-glow. ‘How beautiful,’"
7385,SIXTH BOOK.,Said she.
7386,SIXTH BOOK.,"I answered, trying to be cold."
7387,SIXTH BOOK.,"(Must sin have compensations, was my thought,"
7388,SIXTH BOOK.,As if it were a holy thing like grief?
7389,SIXTH BOOK.,And is a woman to be fooled aside
7390,SIXTH BOOK.,"From putting vice down, with that woman’s toy,"
7391,SIXTH BOOK.,"A baby?)—— ‘Ay! the child is well enough,’"
7392,SIXTH BOOK.,"I answered. ‘If his mother’s palms are clean,"
7393,SIXTH BOOK.,"They need be glad, of course, in clasping such:"
7394,SIXTH BOOK.,"But if not,—I would rather lay my hand,"
7395,SIXTH BOOK.,"Were I she,—on God’s brazen altar-bars"
7396,SIXTH BOOK.,"Red-hot with burning sacrificial lambs,"
7397,SIXTH BOOK.,Than touch the sacred curls of such a child.’
7398,SIXTH BOOK.,
7399,SIXTH BOOK.,"She plunged her fingers in his clustering locks,"
7400,SIXTH BOOK.,As one who would not be afraid of fire;
7401,SIXTH BOOK.,"And then, with indrawn steady utterance, said,—"
7402,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘My lamb, my lamb! although, through such as thou,"
7403,SIXTH BOOK.,The most unclean got courage and approach
7404,SIXTH BOOK.,"To God, once,—now they cannot, even with men,"
7405,SIXTH BOOK.,Find grace enough for pity and gentle words.’
7406,SIXTH BOOK.,
7407,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘My Marian,’ I made answer, grave and sad,"
7408,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘The priest who stole a lamb to offer him,"
7409,SIXTH BOOK.,Was still a thief. And if a woman steals
7410,SIXTH BOOK.,"(Through God’s own barrier-hedges of true love,"
7411,SIXTH BOOK.,Which fence out licence in securing love)
7412,SIXTH BOOK.,"A child like this, that smiles so in her face,"
7413,SIXTH BOOK.,"She is no mother, but a kidnapper,"
7414,SIXTH BOOK.,And he’s a dismal orphan ... not a son;
7415,SIXTH BOOK.,Whom all her kisses cannot feed so full
7416,SIXTH BOOK.,He will not miss hereafter a pure home
7417,SIXTH BOOK.,"To live in, a pure heart to lean against,"
7418,SIXTH BOOK.,A pure good mother’s name and memory
7419,SIXTH BOOK.,"To hope by, when the world grows thick and bad,"
7420,SIXTH BOOK.,And he feels out for virtue.’
7421,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Oh,’ she smiled"
7422,SIXTH BOOK.,"With bitter patience, ‘the child takes his chance,—"
7423,SIXTH BOOK.,Not much worse off in being fatherless
7424,SIXTH BOOK.,"Than I was, fathered. He will say, belike,"
7425,SIXTH BOOK.,His mother was the saddest creature born;
7426,SIXTH BOOK.,He’ll say his mother lived so contrary
7427,SIXTH BOOK.,"To joy, that even the kindest, seeing her,"
7428,SIXTH BOOK.,Grew sometimes almost cruel: he’ll not say
7429,SIXTH BOOK.,She flew contrarious in the face of God
7430,SIXTH BOOK.,"With bat-wings of her vices. Stole my child,—"
7431,SIXTH BOOK.,"My flower of earth, my only flower on earth,"
7432,SIXTH BOOK.,"My sweet, ray beauty!’ ... Up she snatched the child,"
7433,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, breaking on him in a storm of tears,"
7434,SIXTH BOOK.,"Drew out her long sobs from their shivering roots,"
7435,SIXTH BOOK.,"Until he took it for a game, and stretched"
7436,SIXTH BOOK.,"His feet, and flapped his eager arms like wings,"
7437,SIXTH BOOK.,And crowed and gurgled through his infant laugh:
7438,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Mine, mine,’ she said; ‘I have as sure a right"
7439,SIXTH BOOK.,"As any glad proud mother in the world,"
7440,SIXTH BOOK.,Who sets her darling down to cut his teeth
7441,SIXTH BOOK.,"Upon her church-ring. If she talks of law,"
7442,SIXTH BOOK.,I talk of law! I claim my mother-dues
7443,SIXTH BOOK.,"By law,—the law which now is paramount;"
7444,SIXTH BOOK.,"The common law, by which the poor and weak"
7445,SIXTH BOOK.,"Are trodden underfoot by vicious men,"
7446,SIXTH BOOK.,And loathed for ever after by the good.
7447,SIXTH BOOK.,Let pass! I did not filch ... I found the child.’
7448,SIXTH BOOK.,
7449,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘You found him, Marian?’"
7450,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Ay, I found him where"
7451,SIXTH BOOK.,"I found my curse,—in the gutter, with my shame!"
7452,SIXTH BOOK.,"What have you, any of you, to say to that,"
7453,SIXTH BOOK.,"Who all are happy, and sit safe and high,"
7454,SIXTH BOOK.,And never spoke before to arraign my right
7455,SIXTH BOOK.,"To grief itself? What, what, ... being beaten down"
7456,SIXTH BOOK.,"By hoofs of maddened oxen into a ditch,"
7457,SIXTH BOOK.,"Half-dead, whole mangled ... when a girl, at last,"
7458,SIXTH BOOK.,"Breathes, sees ... and finds there, bedded in her flesh,"
7459,SIXTH BOOK.,"Because of the overcoming shock perhaps,"
7460,SIXTH BOOK.,Some coin of price!... and when a good man comes
7461,SIXTH BOOK.,(That’s God! the best men are not quite as good)
7462,SIXTH BOOK.,"And says, ‘I dropped the coin there: take it, you,"
7463,SIXTH BOOK.,"And keep it,—it shall pay you for the loss,’—"
7464,SIXTH BOOK.,You all put up your finger—‘See the thief!
7465,SIXTH BOOK.,Observe that precious thing she has come to filch!
7466,SIXTH BOOK.,"How bad those girls are!’ Oh, my flower, my pet,"
7467,SIXTH BOOK.,"I dare forget I have you in my arms,"
7468,SIXTH BOOK.,"And fly off to be angry with the world,"
7469,SIXTH BOOK.,"And fright you, hurt you with my tempers, till"
7470,SIXTH BOOK.,"You double up your lip? Ah, that indeed"
7471,SIXTH BOOK.,Is bad: a naughty mother!’
7472,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘You mistake,’"
7473,SIXTH BOOK.,"I interrupted; ‘if I loved you not,"
7474,SIXTH BOOK.,"I should not, Marian, certainly be here.’"
7475,SIXTH BOOK.,
7476,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Alas,’ she said, ‘you are so very good;"
7477,SIXTH BOOK.,"And yet I wish, indeed, you had never come"
7478,SIXTH BOOK.,To make me sob until I vex the child.
7479,SIXTH BOOK.,It is not wholesome for these pleasure-plats
7480,SIXTH BOOK.,To be so early watered by our brine.
7481,SIXTH BOOK.,"And then, who knows? he may not like me now"
7482,SIXTH BOOK.,"As well, perhaps, as ere he saw me fret,—"
7483,SIXTH BOOK.,One’s ugly fretting! he has eyes the same
7484,SIXTH BOOK.,"As angels, but he cannot see as deep,"
7485,SIXTH BOOK.,And so I’ve kept for ever in his sight
7486,SIXTH BOOK.,"A sort of smile to please him,—as you place"
7487,SIXTH BOOK.,"A green thing from the garden in a cup,"
7488,SIXTH BOOK.,"To make believe it grows there. Look, my sweet,"
7489,SIXTH BOOK.,"My cowslip-ball! we’ve done with that cross face,"
7490,SIXTH BOOK.,And here’s the face come back you used to like.
7491,SIXTH BOOK.,"Ah, ah! he laughs! he likes me. Ah, Miss Leigh,"
7492,SIXTH BOOK.,"You’re great and pure; but were you purer still,—"
7493,SIXTH BOOK.,"As if you had walked, we’ll say, no otherwhere"
7494,SIXTH BOOK.,"Than up and down the new Jerusalem,"
7495,SIXTH BOOK.,And held your trailing lutestring up yourself
7496,SIXTH BOOK.,"From brushing the twelve stones, for fear of some"
7497,SIXTH BOOK.,"Small speck as little as a needle-prick,"
7498,SIXTH BOOK.,"White stitched on white,—the child would keep to _me_,"
7499,SIXTH BOOK.,"Would choose his poor lost Marian, like me best,"
7500,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, though you stretched your arms, cry back and cling,"
7501,SIXTH BOOK.,"As we do, when God says it’s time to die"
7502,SIXTH BOOK.,"And bids us go up higher. Leave us, then;"
7503,SIXTH BOOK.,We two are happy. Does _he_ push me off?
7504,SIXTH BOOK.,"He’s satisfied with me, as I with him.’"
7505,SIXTH BOOK.,
7506,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘So soft to one, so hard to others! Nay,’"
7507,SIXTH BOOK.,"I cried, more angry that she melted me,"
7508,SIXTH BOOK.,‘We make henceforth a cushion of our faults
7509,SIXTH BOOK.,To sit and practise easy virtues on?
7510,SIXTH BOOK.,I thought a child was given to sanctify
7511,SIXTH BOOK.,"A woman,—set her in the sight of all"
7512,SIXTH BOOK.,"The clear-eyed Heavens, a chosen minister"
7513,SIXTH BOOK.,To do their business and lead spirits up
7514,SIXTH BOOK.,"The difficult blue heights. A woman lives,"
7515,SIXTH BOOK.,"Not bettered, quickened toward the truth and good"
7516,SIXTH BOOK.,Through being a mother?... then she’s none! although
7517,SIXTH BOOK.,"She damps her baby’s cheeks by kissing them,"
7518,SIXTH BOOK.,As we kill roses.’
7519,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Kill! O Christ,’ she said,"
7520,SIXTH BOOK.,And turned her wild sad face from side to side
7521,SIXTH BOOK.,"With most despairing wonder in it—‘What,"
7522,SIXTH BOOK.,"What have you in your souls against me then,"
7523,SIXTH BOOK.,"All of you? am I wicked, do you think?"
7524,SIXTH BOOK.,"God knows me, trusts me with the child! but you,"
7525,SIXTH BOOK.,You think me really wicked?’
7526,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Complaisant,’"
7527,SIXTH BOOK.,"I answered softly, ‘to a wrong you’ve done,"
7528,SIXTH BOOK.,"Because of certain profits,—which is wrong"
7529,SIXTH BOOK.,"Beyond the first wrong, Marian. When you left"
7530,SIXTH BOOK.,"The pure place and the noble heart, to take"
7531,SIXTH BOOK.,The hand of a seducer’....
7532,SIXTH BOOK.,‘Whom? whose hand?
7533,SIXTH BOOK.,I took the hand of’....
7534,SIXTH BOOK.,"Springing up erect,"
7535,SIXTH BOOK.,"And lifting up the child at full arm’s length,"
7536,SIXTH BOOK.,As if to bear him like an oriflamme
7537,SIXTH BOOK.,"Unconquerable to armies of reproach,—"
7538,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘By _him_’ she said, ‘my child’s head and its curls,"
7539,SIXTH BOOK.,By those blue eyes no woman born could dare
7540,SIXTH BOOK.,"A perjury on, I make my mother’s oath,"
7541,SIXTH BOOK.,"That if I left that Heart, to lighten it,"
7542,SIXTH BOOK.,"The blood of mine was still, except for grief!"
7543,SIXTH BOOK.,"No cleaner maid than I was, took a step"
7544,SIXTH BOOK.,"To a sadder end,—no matron-mother now"
7545,SIXTH BOOK.,Looks backward to her early maidenhood
7546,SIXTH BOOK.,Through chaster pulses. I speak steadily:
7547,SIXTH BOOK.,"And if I lie so, ... if, being fouled in will"
7548,SIXTH BOOK.,"And paltered with in soul by devil’s lust,"
7549,SIXTH BOOK.,"I dared to bid this angel take my part, ..."
7550,SIXTH BOOK.,"Would God sit quiet, let us think, in heaven,"
7551,SIXTH BOOK.,Nor strike me dumb with thunder? Yet I speak:
7552,SIXTH BOOK.,"He clears me therefore. What, ‘seduced’’s your word?"
7553,SIXTH BOOK.,Do wolves seduce a wandering fawn in France?
7554,SIXTH BOOK.,"Do eagles, who have pinched a lamb with claws,"
7555,SIXTH BOOK.,Seduce it into carrion? So with me.
7556,SIXTH BOOK.,"I was not ever, as you say, seduced,"
7557,SIXTH BOOK.,"But simply, murdered.’"
7558,SIXTH BOOK.,"There she paused, and sighed,"
7559,SIXTH BOOK.,With such a sigh as drops from agony
7560,SIXTH BOOK.,"To exhaustion,—sighing while she let the babe"
7561,SIXTH BOOK.,"Slide down upon her bosom from her arms,"
7562,SIXTH BOOK.,"And all her face’s light fell after him,"
7563,SIXTH BOOK.,"Like a torch quenched in falling. Down she sank,"
7564,SIXTH BOOK.,And sate upon the bedside with the child.
7565,SIXTH BOOK.,
7566,SIXTH BOOK.,"But I, convicted, broken utterly,"
7567,SIXTH BOOK.,"With woman’s passion clung about her waist,"
7568,SIXTH BOOK.,"And kissed her hair and eyes,—‘I have been wrong,"
7569,SIXTH BOOK.,Sweet Marian’ ... (weeping in a tender rage)
7570,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Sweet holy Marian! And now, Marian, now,"
7571,SIXTH BOOK.,"I’ll use your oath although my lips are hard,"
7572,SIXTH BOOK.,"And by the child, my Marian, by the child,"
7573,SIXTH BOOK.,I’ll swear his mother shall be innocent
7574,SIXTH BOOK.,"Before my conscience, as in the open Book"
7575,SIXTH BOOK.,"Of Him who reads for judgement. Innocent,"
7576,SIXTH BOOK.,"My sister! let the night be ne’er so dark,"
7577,SIXTH BOOK.,The moon is surely somewhere in the sky;
7578,SIXTH BOOK.,So surely is your whiteness to be found
7579,SIXTH BOOK.,"Through all dark facts. But pardon, pardon me,"
7580,SIXTH BOOK.,"And smile a little, Marian,—for the child,"
7581,SIXTH BOOK.,"If not for me, my sister.’"
7582,SIXTH BOOK.,The poor lip
7583,SIXTH BOOK.,Just motioned for the smile and let it go:
7584,SIXTH BOOK.,"And then, with scarce a stirring of the mouth,"
7585,SIXTH BOOK.,"As if a statue spoke that could not breathe,"
7586,SIXTH BOOK.,"But spoke on calm between its marble lips,—"
7587,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘I’m glad, I’m very glad you clear me so."
7588,SIXTH BOOK.,I should be sorry that you set me down
7589,SIXTH BOOK.,"With harlots, or with even a better name"
7590,SIXTH BOOK.,"Which misbecomes his mother. For the rest,"
7591,SIXTH BOOK.,"I am not on a level with your love,"
7592,SIXTH BOOK.,"Nor ever was, you know,—but now am worse,"
7593,SIXTH BOOK.,Because that world of yours has dealt with me
7594,SIXTH BOOK.,As when the hard sea bites and chews a stone
7595,SIXTH BOOK.,And changes the first form of it. I’ve marked
7596,SIXTH BOOK.,A shore of pebbles bitten to one shape
7597,SIXTH BOOK.,From all the various life of madrepores;
7598,SIXTH BOOK.,"And so, that little stone, called Marian Erle,"
7599,SIXTH BOOK.,"Picked up and dropped by you and another friend,"
7600,SIXTH BOOK.,Was ground and tortured by the incessant sea
7601,SIXTH BOOK.,"And bruised from what she was,—changed! death’s a change,"
7602,SIXTH BOOK.,"And she, I said, was murdered; Marian’s dead."
7603,SIXTH BOOK.,"What can you do with people when they are dead,"
7604,SIXTH BOOK.,"But, if you are pious, sing a hymn and go,"
7605,SIXTH BOOK.,"Or, if you are tender, heave a sigh and go,"
7606,SIXTH BOOK.,"But go by all means,—and permit the grass"
7607,SIXTH BOOK.,To keep its green feud up ’twixt them and you?
7608,SIXTH BOOK.,"Then leave me,—let me rest. I’m dead, I say."
7609,SIXTH BOOK.,"And if, to save the child from death as well,"
7610,SIXTH BOOK.,"The mother in me has survived the rest,"
7611,SIXTH BOOK.,"Why, that’s God’s miracle you must not tax,—"
7612,SIXTH BOOK.,I’m not less dead for that: I’m nothing more
7613,SIXTH BOOK.,"But just a mother. Only for the child,"
7614,SIXTH BOOK.,"I’m warm, and cold, and hungry, and afraid,"
7615,SIXTH BOOK.,"And smell the flowers a little, and see the sun,"
7616,SIXTH BOOK.,"And speak still, and am silent,—just for him!"
7617,SIXTH BOOK.,"I pray you therefore to mistake me not,"
7618,SIXTH BOOK.,"And treat me, haply, as I were alive;"
7619,SIXTH BOOK.,"For though you ran a pin into my soul,"
7620,SIXTH BOOK.,I think it would not hurt nor trouble me.
7621,SIXTH BOOK.,"Here’s proof, dear lady,—in the market-place"
7622,SIXTH BOOK.,"But now, you promised me to say a word"
7623,SIXTH BOOK.,"About ... a friend, who once, long years ago,"
7624,SIXTH BOOK.,"Took God’s place toward me, when He draws and loves"
7625,SIXTH BOOK.,"And does not thunder, ... whom at last I left,"
7626,SIXTH BOOK.,"As all of us leave God. You thought perhaps,"
7627,SIXTH BOOK.,I seemed to care for hearing of that friend?
7628,SIXTH BOOK.,"Now, judge me! we have sate here half-an-hour"
7629,SIXTH BOOK.,"And talked together of the child and me,"
7630,SIXTH BOOK.,"And I not asked as much as, ‘What’s the thing"
7631,SIXTH BOOK.,You had to tell me of the friend ... the friend?’
7632,SIXTH BOOK.,"He’s sad, I think you said,—he’s sick perhaps?"
7633,SIXTH BOOK.,It’s nought to Marian if he’s sad or sick.
7634,SIXTH BOOK.,Another would have crawled beside your foot
7635,SIXTH BOOK.,"And prayed your words out. Why, a beast, a dog,"
7636,SIXTH BOOK.,"A starved cat, if he had fed it once with milk,"
7637,SIXTH BOOK.,"Would show less hardness. But I’m dead, you see,"
7638,SIXTH BOOK.,And that explains it.’
7639,SIXTH BOOK.,"Poor, poor thing, she spoke"
7640,SIXTH BOOK.,"And shook her head, as white and calm as frost"
7641,SIXTH BOOK.,"On days too cold for raining any more,"
7642,SIXTH BOOK.,"But still with such a face, so much alive,"
7643,SIXTH BOOK.,I could not choose but take it on my arm
7644,SIXTH BOOK.,"And stroke the placid patience of its cheeks,—"
7645,SIXTH BOOK.,"Then told my story out, of Romney Leigh,"
7646,SIXTH BOOK.,"How, having lost her, sought her, missed her still,"
7647,SIXTH BOOK.,"He, broken-hearted for himself and her,"
7648,SIXTH BOOK.,Had drawn the curtains of the world awhile
7649,SIXTH BOOK.,"As if he had done with morning. There I stopped,"
7650,SIXTH BOOK.,"For when she gasped, and pressed me with her eyes,"
7651,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘And now ... how is it with him? tell me now,’—"
7652,SIXTH BOOK.,"I felt the shame of compensated grief,"
7653,SIXTH BOOK.,And chose my words with scruple—slowly stepped
7654,SIXTH BOOK.,Upon the slippery stones set here and there
7655,SIXTH BOOK.,"Across the sliding water. ‘Certainly,"
7656,SIXTH BOOK.,"As evening empties morning into night,"
7657,SIXTH BOOK.,Another morning takes the evening up
7658,SIXTH BOOK.,"With healthful, providential interchange;"
7659,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, though he thought still of her,’—"
7660,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Yes, she knew,"
7661,SIXTH BOOK.,"She understood: she had supposed, indeed,"
7662,SIXTH BOOK.,"That, as one stops a hole upon a flute,"
7663,SIXTH BOOK.,"At which a new note comes and shapes the tune,"
7664,SIXTH BOOK.,"Excluding her would bring a worthier in,"
7665,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, long ere this, that Lady Waldemar"
7666,SIXTH BOOK.,He loved so’ ...
7667,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Loved,’ I started,—‘loved her so!"
7668,SIXTH BOOK.,Now tell me’ ...
7669,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘I will tell you,’ she replied:"
7670,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘But since we’re taking oaths, you’ll promise first"
7671,SIXTH BOOK.,"That he, in England, he, shall never learn"
7672,SIXTH BOOK.,"In what a dreadful trap his creature here,"
7673,SIXTH BOOK.,Round whose unworthy neck he had meant to tie
7674,SIXTH BOOK.,"The honourable ribbon of his name,"
7675,SIXTH BOOK.,"Fell unaware, and came to butchery:"
7676,SIXTH BOOK.,"Because,—I know him,—as he takes to heart"
7677,SIXTH BOOK.,"The grief of every stranger, he’s not like"
7678,SIXTH BOOK.,To banish mine as far as I should choose
7679,SIXTH BOOK.,In wishing him most happy. Now he leaves
7680,SIXTH BOOK.,"To think of me, perverse, who went my way,"
7681,SIXTH BOOK.,"Unkind, and left him,—but if once he knew ..."
7682,SIXTH BOOK.,"Ah, then, the sharp nail of my cruel wrong"
7683,SIXTH BOOK.,"Would fasten me for ever in his sight,"
7684,SIXTH BOOK.,"Like some poor curious bird, through each spread wing"
7685,SIXTH BOOK.,"Nailed high up over a fierce hunter’s fire,"
7686,SIXTH BOOK.,To spoil the dinner of all tenderer folk
7687,SIXTH BOOK.,"Come in by chance. Nay, since your Marian’s dead,"
7688,SIXTH BOOK.,"You shall not hang her up, but dig a hole"
7689,SIXTH BOOK.,And bury her in silence! ring no bells.’
7690,SIXTH BOOK.,
7691,SIXTH BOOK.,"I answered gaily, though my whole voice wept;"
7692,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘We’ll ring the joy-bells, not the funeral-bells,"
7693,SIXTH BOOK.,"Because we have her back, dead or alive.’"
7694,SIXTH BOOK.,
7695,SIXTH BOOK.,"She never answered that, but shook her head;"
7696,SIXTH BOOK.,"Then low and calm, as one who, safe in heaven,"
7697,SIXTH BOOK.,"Shall tell a story of his lower life,"
7698,SIXTH BOOK.,"Unmoved by shame or anger,—so she spoke."
7699,SIXTH BOOK.,"She told me she had loved upon her knees,"
7700,SIXTH BOOK.,"As others pray, more perfectly absorbed"
7701,SIXTH BOOK.,"In the act and aspiration. She felt his,"
7702,SIXTH BOOK.,"For just his uses, not her own at all,"
7703,SIXTH BOOK.,"His stool, to sit on, or put up his foot,"
7704,SIXTH BOOK.,"His cup, to fill with wine or vinegar,"
7705,SIXTH BOOK.,"Whichever drink might please him at the chance,"
7706,SIXTH BOOK.,For that should please her always: let him write
7707,SIXTH BOOK.,His name upon her ... it seemed natural;
7708,SIXTH BOOK.,"It was most precious, standing on his shelf,"
7709,SIXTH BOOK.,To wait until he chose to lift his hand.
7710,SIXTH BOOK.,"Well, well,—I saw her then, and must have seen"
7711,SIXTH BOOK.,"How bright her life went, floating on her love,"
7712,SIXTH BOOK.,"Like wicks the housewives send afloat on oil,"
7713,SIXTH BOOK.,Which feeds them to a flame that lasts the night.
7714,SIXTH BOOK.,
7715,SIXTH BOOK.,"To do good seemed so much his business,"
7716,SIXTH BOOK.,"That, having done it, she was fain to think,"
7717,SIXTH BOOK.,Must fill up his capacity for joy.
7718,SIXTH BOOK.,At first she never mooted with herself
7719,SIXTH BOOK.,"If _he_ was happy, since he made her so,"
7720,SIXTH BOOK.,"Or if _he_ loved her, being so much beloved:"
7721,SIXTH BOOK.,"Who thinks of asking if the sun is light,"
7722,SIXTH BOOK.,"Observing that it lightens? who’s so bold,"
7723,SIXTH BOOK.,To question God of His felicity?
7724,SIXTH BOOK.,"Still less. And thus she took for granted first,"
7725,SIXTH BOOK.,"What first of all she should have put to proof,"
7726,SIXTH BOOK.,"And sinned against him so, but only so."
7727,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘What could you hope,’ she said, ‘of such as she?"
7728,SIXTH BOOK.,"You take a kid you like, and turn it out"
7729,SIXTH BOOK.,In some fair garden; though the creature’s fond
7730,SIXTH BOOK.,"And gentle, it will leap upon the beds"
7731,SIXTH BOOK.,"And break your tulips, bite your tender trees:"
7732,SIXTH BOOK.,The wonder would be if such innocence
7733,SIXTH BOOK.,Spoiled less. A garden is no place for kids.’
7734,SIXTH BOOK.,
7735,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, by degrees, when he who had chosen her,"
7736,SIXTH BOOK.,Brought in his courteous and benignant friends
7737,SIXTH BOOK.,"To spend their goodness on her, which she took"
7738,SIXTH BOOK.,"So very gladly, as a part of his,—"
7739,SIXTH BOOK.,"By slow degrees, it broke on her slow sense,"
7740,SIXTH BOOK.,"That she, too, in that Eden of delight"
7741,SIXTH BOOK.,"Was out of place, and, like the silly kid,"
7742,SIXTH BOOK.,Still did most mischief where she meant most love.
7743,SIXTH BOOK.,"A thought enough to make a woman mad,"
7744,SIXTH BOOK.,"(No beast in this, but she may well go mad)"
7745,SIXTH BOOK.,"That, saying ‘I am thine to love and use,’"
7746,SIXTH BOOK.,May blow the plague in her protesting breath
7747,SIXTH BOOK.,"To the very man for whom she claims to die,—"
7748,SIXTH BOOK.,"That, clinging round his neck, she pulls him down"
7749,SIXTH BOOK.,"And drowns him,—and that, lavishing her soul,"
7750,SIXTH BOOK.,"She hales perdition on him. ‘So, being mad,’"
7751,SIXTH BOOK.,Said Marian ...
7752,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Ah—who stirred such thoughts, you ask?"
7753,SIXTH BOOK.,"Whose fault it was, that she should have such thoughts?"
7754,SIXTH BOOK.,"None’s fault, none’s fault. The light comes, and we see:"
7755,SIXTH BOOK.,"But if it were not truly for our eyes,"
7756,SIXTH BOOK.,"There would be nothing seen, for all the light;"
7757,SIXTH BOOK.,"And so with Marian. If she saw at last,"
7758,SIXTH BOOK.,"The sense was in her,—Lady Waldemar"
7759,SIXTH BOOK.,Had spoken all in vain else.’
7760,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘O my heart,"
7761,SIXTH BOOK.,"O prophet in my heart,’ I cried aloud,"
7762,SIXTH BOOK.,‘Then Lady Waldemar spoke!’
7763,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘_Did_ she speak,’"
7764,SIXTH BOOK.,Mused Marian softly—‘or did she only sign?
7765,SIXTH BOOK.,Or did she put a word into her face
7766,SIXTH BOOK.,"And look, and so impress you with the word?"
7767,SIXTH BOOK.,"Or leave it in the foldings of her gown,"
7768,SIXTH BOOK.,"Like rosemary smells, a movement will shake out"
7769,SIXTH BOOK.,"When no one’s conscious? who shall say, or guess?"
7770,SIXTH BOOK.,"One thing alone was certain,—from the day"
7771,SIXTH BOOK.,"The gracious lady paid a visit first,"
7772,SIXTH BOOK.,"She, Marian, saw things different,—felt distrust"
7773,SIXTH BOOK.,Of all that sheltering roof of circumstance
7774,SIXTH BOOK.,Her hopes were building into with clay nests:
7775,SIXTH BOOK.,"Her heart was restless, pacing up and down"
7776,SIXTH BOOK.,"And fluttering, like dumb creatures before storms,"
7777,SIXTH BOOK.,Not knowing wherefore she was ill at ease.’
7778,SIXTH BOOK.,
7779,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘And still the lady came,’ said Marian Erle,"
7780,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Much oftener than _he_ knew it, Mister Leigh."
7781,SIXTH BOOK.,"She bade me never tell him that she had come,"
7782,SIXTH BOOK.,"She liked to love me better than he knew,"
7783,SIXTH BOOK.,So very kind was Lady Waldemar:
7784,SIXTH BOOK.,"And every time she brought with her more light,"
7785,SIXTH BOOK.,"And every light made sorrow clearer ... Well,"
7786,SIXTH BOOK.,"Ah, well! we cannot give her blame for that;"
7787,SIXTH BOOK.,"’Twould be the same thing if an angel came,"
7788,SIXTH BOOK.,Whose right should prove our wrong. And every time
7789,SIXTH BOOK.,"The lady came, she looked more beautiful,"
7790,SIXTH BOOK.,"And spoke more like a flute among green trees,"
7791,SIXTH BOOK.,"Until at last, as one, whose heart being sad"
7792,SIXTH BOOK.,"On hearing lovely music, suddenly"
7793,SIXTH BOOK.,"Dissolves in weeping, I brake out in tears"
7794,SIXTH BOOK.,Before her ... asked her counsel ... ‘had I erred
7795,SIXTH BOOK.,In being too happy? would she set me straight?
7796,SIXTH BOOK.,"For she, being wise and good and born above"
7797,SIXTH BOOK.,"The flats I had never climbed from, could perceive"
7798,SIXTH BOOK.,"If such as I, might grow upon the hills;"
7799,SIXTH BOOK.,"And whether such poor herb sufficed to grow,"
7800,SIXTH BOOK.,"For Romney Leigh to break his fast upon ’t,—"
7801,SIXTH BOOK.,"Or would he pine on such, or haply starve?’"
7802,SIXTH BOOK.,"She wrapt me in her generous arms at once,"
7803,SIXTH BOOK.,And let me dream a moment how it feels
7804,SIXTH BOOK.,"To have a real mother, like some girls:"
7805,SIXTH BOOK.,"But when I looked, her face was younger ... ay,"
7806,SIXTH BOOK.,"Youth’s too bright not to be a little hard,"
7807,SIXTH BOOK.,"And beauty keeps itself still uppermost,"
7808,SIXTH BOOK.,"That’s true!—Though Lady Waldemar was kind,"
7809,SIXTH BOOK.,"She hurt me, hurt, as if the morning-sun"
7810,SIXTH BOOK.,"Should smite us on the eyelids when we sleep,"
7811,SIXTH BOOK.,"And wake us up with headache. Ay, and soon"
7812,SIXTH BOOK.,Was light enough to make my heart ache too:
7813,SIXTH BOOK.,She told me truths I asked for ... ’twas my fault ...
7814,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘That Romney could not love me, if he would,"
7815,SIXTH BOOK.,As men call loving; there are bloods that flow
7816,SIXTH BOOK.,"Together, like some rivers, and not mix,"
7817,SIXTH BOOK.,Through contraries of nature. He indeed
7818,SIXTH BOOK.,"Was set to wed me, to espouse my class,"
7819,SIXTH BOOK.,"Act out a rash opinion,—and, once wed,"
7820,SIXTH BOOK.,"So just a man and gentle, could not choose"
7821,SIXTH BOOK.,"But make my life as smooth as marriage-ring,"
7822,SIXTH BOOK.,"Bespeak me mildly, keep me a cheerful house,"
7823,SIXTH BOOK.,"With servants, broaches, all the flowers I liked,"
7824,SIXTH BOOK.,"And pretty dresses, silk the whole year round’ ..."
7825,SIXTH BOOK.,"At which I stopped her,—‘This for me. And now"
7826,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘For _him_.’—She murmured,—truth grew difficult;"
7827,SIXTH BOOK.,"She owned, ‘’Twas plain a man like Romney Leigh"
7828,SIXTH BOOK.,Required a wife more level to himself.
7829,SIXTH BOOK.,If day by day he had to bend his height
7830,SIXTH BOOK.,"To pick up sympathies, opinions, thoughts,"
7831,SIXTH BOOK.,And interchange the common talk of life
7832,SIXTH BOOK.,"Which helps a man to live as well as talk,"
7833,SIXTH BOOK.,His days were heavily taxed. Who buys a staff
7834,SIXTH BOOK.,"To fit the hand, that reaches but the knee?"
7835,SIXTH BOOK.,He’d feel it bitter to be forced to miss
7836,SIXTH BOOK.,"The perfect joy of married suited pairs,"
7837,SIXTH BOOK.,"Who, bursting through the separating hedge"
7838,SIXTH BOOK.,Of personal dues with that sweet eglantine
7839,SIXTH BOOK.,"Of equal love, keep saying, ‘So _we_ think,"
7840,SIXTH BOOK.,"It strikes _us_,—that’s _our_ fancy.’‘—When I asked"
7841,SIXTH BOOK.,"If earnest will, devoted love, employed"
7842,SIXTH BOOK.,"In youth like mine, would fail to raise me up,—"
7843,SIXTH BOOK.,As two strong arms will always raise a child
7844,SIXTH BOOK.,To a fruit hung overhead? she sighed and sighed ...
7845,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘That could not be,’ she feared. ‘You take a pink,"
7846,SIXTH BOOK.,"You dig about its roots and water it,"
7847,SIXTH BOOK.,"And so improve it to a garden-pink,"
7848,SIXTH BOOK.,"But will not change it to a heliotrope,"
7849,SIXTH BOOK.,"The kind remains. And then, the harder truth—"
7850,SIXTH BOOK.,"This Romney Leigh, so rash to leap a pale,"
7851,SIXTH BOOK.,"So bold for conscience, quick for martyrdom,"
7852,SIXTH BOOK.,"Would suffer steadily and never flinch,"
7853,SIXTH BOOK.,"But suffer surely and keenly, when his class"
7854,SIXTH BOOK.,"Turned shoulder on him for a shameful match,"
7855,SIXTH BOOK.,"And set him up as nine-pin in their talk,"
7856,SIXTH BOOK.,"To bowl him down with jestings.’—There, she paused;"
7857,SIXTH BOOK.,And when I used the pause in doubting that
7858,SIXTH BOOK.,We wronged him after all in what we feared—
7859,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Suppose such things should never touch him, more"
7860,SIXTH BOOK.,"In his high conscience, (if the things should be,)"
7861,SIXTH BOOK.,"Than, when the queen sits in an upper room,"
7862,SIXTH BOOK.,The horses in the street can spatter her!’—
7863,SIXTH BOOK.,"A moment, hope came,—but the lady closed"
7864,SIXTH BOOK.,"That door and nicked the lock, and shut it out,"
7865,SIXTH BOOK.,"Observing wisely that, ‘the tender heart"
7866,SIXTH BOOK.,"Which made him over-soft to a lower class,"
7867,SIXTH BOOK.,Could scarcely fail to make him sensitive
7868,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘To a higher,—how they thought, and what they felt.’"
7869,SIXTH BOOK.,
7870,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Alas, alas,’ said Marian, rocking slow"
7871,SIXTH BOOK.,"The pretty baby who was near asleep,"
7872,SIXTH BOOK.,"The eyelids creeping over the blue balls,—"
7873,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘She made it clear, too clear—I saw the whole!"
7874,SIXTH BOOK.,And yet who knows if I had seen my way
7875,SIXTH BOOK.,"Straight out of it, by looking, though ’twas clear,"
7876,SIXTH BOOK.,"Unless the generous lady, ’ware of this,"
7877,SIXTH BOOK.,"Had set her own house all a-fire for me,"
7878,SIXTH BOOK.,To light me forwards? Leaning on my face
7879,SIXTH BOOK.,"Her heavy agate eyes which crushed my will,"
7880,SIXTH BOOK.,"She told me tenderly, (as when men come"
7881,SIXTH BOOK.,To a bedside to tell people they must die)
7882,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘She knew of knowledge,—ay, of knowledge, knew,"
7883,SIXTH BOOK.,That Romney Leigh had loved _her_ formerly;
7884,SIXTH BOOK.,"And _she_ loved _him_, she might say, now the chance"
7885,SIXTH BOOK.,"Was past ... but that, of course, he never guessed,—"
7886,SIXTH BOOK.,For something came between them ... something thin
7887,SIXTH BOOK.,As a cobweb ... catching every fly of doubt
7888,SIXTH BOOK.,To hold it buzzing at the window-pane
7889,SIXTH BOOK.,"And help to dim the daylight. Ah, man’s pride"
7890,SIXTH BOOK.,Or woman’s—which is greatest? most averse
7891,SIXTH BOOK.,"To brushing cobwebs? Well, but she and he"
7892,SIXTH BOOK.,"Remained fast friends; it seemed not more than so,"
7893,SIXTH BOOK.,Because he had bound his hands and could not stir:
7894,SIXTH BOOK.,"An honourable man, if somewhat rash;"
7895,SIXTH BOOK.,"And she, not even for Romney, would she spill"
7896,SIXTH BOOK.,A blot ... as little even as a tear ...
7897,SIXTH BOOK.,"Upon his marriage-contract,—not to gain"
7898,SIXTH BOOK.,A better joy for two than came by that!
7899,SIXTH BOOK.,"For, though I stood between her heart and heaven,"
7900,SIXTH BOOK.,She loved me wholly.’
7901,SIXTH BOOK.,Did I laugh or curse?
7902,SIXTH BOOK.,"I think I sate there silent, hearing all,"
7903,SIXTH BOOK.,"Ay, hearing double,—Marian’s tale, at once,"
7904,SIXTH BOOK.,"And Romney’s marriage-vow, ‘_I’ll keep to_ THEE,’"
7905,SIXTH BOOK.,Which means that woman-serpent. Is it time
7906,SIXTH BOOK.,For church now?
7907,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘Lady Waldemar spoke more,’"
7908,SIXTH BOOK.,"Continued Marian, ‘but, as when a soul"
7909,SIXTH BOOK.,Will pass out through the sweetness of a song
7910,SIXTH BOOK.,"Beyond it, voyaging the uphill road,—"
7911,SIXTH BOOK.,"Even so, mine wandered from the things I heard,"
7912,SIXTH BOOK.,To those I suffered. It was afterward
7913,SIXTH BOOK.,I shaped the resolution to the act.
7914,SIXTH BOOK.,For many hours we talked. What need to talk?
7915,SIXTH BOOK.,The fate was clear and close; it touched my eyes;
7916,SIXTH BOOK.,But still the generous lady tried to keep
7917,SIXTH BOOK.,"The case afloat, and would not let it go,"
7918,SIXTH BOOK.,"And argued, struggled upon Marian’s side,"
7919,SIXTH BOOK.,Which was not Romney’s! though she little knew
7920,SIXTH BOOK.,"What ugly monster would take up the end,—"
7921,SIXTH BOOK.,What griping death within the drowning death
7922,SIXTH BOOK.,Was ready to complete my sum of death.’
7923,SIXTH BOOK.,
7924,SIXTH BOOK.,"I thought,—Perhaps he’s sliding now the ring"
7925,SIXTH BOOK.,Upon that woman’s finger....
7926,SIXTH BOOK.,She went on:
7927,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘The lady, failing to prevail her way,"
7928,SIXTH BOOK.,"Upgathered my torn wishes from the ground,"
7929,SIXTH BOOK.,And pieced them with her strong benevolence;
7930,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, as I thought I could breathe freer air"
7931,SIXTH BOOK.,"Away from England, going without pause,"
7932,SIXTH BOOK.,"Without farewell,—just breaking with a jerk"
7933,SIXTH BOOK.,"The blossomed offshoot from my thorny life,—"
7934,SIXTH BOOK.,"She promised kindly to provide the means,"
7935,SIXTH BOOK.,With instant passage to the colonies
7936,SIXTH BOOK.,"And full protection,—‘would commit me straight"
7937,SIXTH BOOK.,‘To one who once had been her waiting-maid
7938,SIXTH BOOK.,"And had the customs of the world, intent"
7939,SIXTH BOOK.,On changing England for Australia
7940,SIXTH BOOK.,"Herself, to carry out her fortune so.’"
7941,SIXTH BOOK.,"For which I thanked the Lady Waldemar,"
7942,SIXTH BOOK.,As men upon their death-beds thank last friends
7943,SIXTH BOOK.,"Who lay the pillow straight: it is not much,"
7944,SIXTH BOOK.,"And yet ’tis all of which they are capable,"
7945,SIXTH BOOK.,This lying smoothly in a bed to die.
7946,SIXTH BOOK.,"And so, ’twas fixed;—and so, from day to day,"
7947,SIXTH BOOK.,"The woman named, came in to visit me.’"
7948,SIXTH BOOK.,
7949,SIXTH BOOK.,"Just then, the girl stopped speaking,—sate erect,"
7950,SIXTH BOOK.,"And stared at me as if I had been a ghost,"
7951,SIXTH BOOK.,(Perhaps I looked as white as any ghost)
7952,SIXTH BOOK.,"With large-eyed horror. ‘Does God make,’ she said,"
7953,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘All sorts of creatures, really, do you think?"
7954,SIXTH BOOK.,Or is it that the Devil slavers them
7955,SIXTH BOOK.,"So excellently, that we come to doubt"
7956,SIXTH BOOK.,"Who’s strongest, He who makes, or he who mars?"
7957,SIXTH BOOK.,"I never liked the woman’s face, or voice,"
7958,SIXTH BOOK.,Or ways: it made me blush to look at her;
7959,SIXTH BOOK.,It made me tremble if she touched my hand;
7960,SIXTH BOOK.,"And when she spoke a fondling word, I shrank,"
7961,SIXTH BOOK.,"As if one hated me, who had power to hurt;"
7962,SIXTH BOOK.,"And, every time she came, my veins ran cold,"
7963,SIXTH BOOK.,As somebody were walking on my grave.
7964,SIXTH BOOK.,At last I spoke to Lady Waldemar:
7965,SIXTH BOOK.,‘Could such an one be good to trust?’ I asked.
7966,SIXTH BOOK.,Whereat the lady stroked my cheek and laughed
7967,SIXTH BOOK.,"Her silver-laugh—(one must be born to laugh,"
7968,SIXTH BOOK.,"To put such music in it) ‘Foolish girl,"
7969,SIXTH BOOK.,‘Your scattered wits are gathering wool beyond
7970,SIXTH BOOK.,The sheep-walk reaches!—leave the thing to me.’
7971,SIXTH BOOK.,"And therefore, half in trust, and half in scorn"
7972,SIXTH BOOK.,That I had heart still for another fear
7973,SIXTH BOOK.,"In such a safe despair, I left the thing."
7974,SIXTH BOOK.,
7975,SIXTH BOOK.,‘The rest is short. I was obedient:
7976,SIXTH BOOK.,I wrote my letter which delivered _him_
7977,SIXTH BOOK.,"From Marian, to his own prosperities,"
7978,SIXTH BOOK.,"And followed that bad guide. The lady?—hush,—"
7979,SIXTH BOOK.,I never blame the lady. Ladies who
7980,SIXTH BOOK.,"Sit high, however willing to look down,"
7981,SIXTH BOOK.,Will scarce see lower than their dainty feet:
7982,SIXTH BOOK.,"And Lady Waldemar saw less than I,"
7983,SIXTH BOOK.,With what a Devil’s daughter I went forth
7984,SIXTH BOOK.,"The swine’s road, headlong over a precipice,"
7985,SIXTH BOOK.,"In such a curl of hell-foam caught and choked,"
7986,SIXTH BOOK.,No shriek of soul in anguish could pierce through
7987,SIXTH BOOK.,To fetch some help. They say there’s help in heaven
7988,SIXTH BOOK.,For all such cries. But if one cries from hell ...
7989,SIXTH BOOK.,What then?—the heavens are deaf upon that side.
7990,SIXTH BOOK.,
7991,SIXTH BOOK.,"‘A woman ... hear me,—let me make it plain,—"
7992,SIXTH BOOK.,A woman ... not a monster ... both her breasts
7993,SIXTH BOOK.,"Made right to suckle babes ... she took me off,"
7994,SIXTH BOOK.,"A woman also, young and ignorant,"
7995,SIXTH BOOK.,"And heavy with my grief, my two poor eyes"
7996,SIXTH BOOK.,"Near washed away with weeping, till the trees,"
7997,SIXTH BOOK.,"The blessed unaccustomed trees and fields,"
7998,SIXTH BOOK.,"Ran either side the train, like stranger dogs"
7999,SIXTH BOOK.,"Unworthy of any notice,—took me off,"
8000,SIXTH BOOK.,"So dull, so blind, and only half alive,"
8001,SIXTH BOOK.,"Not seeing by what road, nor by what ship,"
8002,SIXTH BOOK.,"Nor toward what place, nor to what end of all.—"
8003,SIXTH BOOK.,"Men carry a corpse thus,—past the doorway, past"
8004,SIXTH BOOK.,"The garden-gate, the children’s playground, up"
8005,SIXTH BOOK.,"The green lane,—then they leave it in the pit,"
8006,SIXTH BOOK.,"To sleep and find corruption, cheek to cheek"
8007,SIXTH BOOK.,With him who stinks since Friday.
8008,SIXTH BOOK.,‘But suppose;
8009,SIXTH BOOK.,"To go down with one’s soul into the grave,—"
8010,SIXTH BOOK.,"To go down half dead, half alive, I say,"
8011,SIXTH BOOK.,"And wake up with corruption, ... cheek to cheek"
8012,SIXTH BOOK.,"With him who stinks since Friday! There it is,"
8013,SIXTH BOOK.,"And that’s the horror of ’t, Miss Leigh."

8039,SIXTH BOOK.,"Not man’s seduction, made me what I am,"
8040,SIXTH BOOK.,As lost as ... I told _him_ I should be lost;
8041,SIXTH BOOK.,"When mothers fail us, can we help ourselves?"
8042,SIXTH BOOK.,"That’s fatal!—And you call it being lost,"
8043,SIXTH BOOK.,That down came next day’s noon and caught me there
8044,SIXTH BOOK.,"Half gibbering and half raving on the floor,"
8045,SIXTH BOOK.,"And wondering what had happened up in heaven,"

8071,SIXTH BOOK.,A woman has been strangled with less weight:
8072,SIXTH BOOK.,I threw it in a ditch to keep it clean
8073,SIXTH BOOK.,"And ease my breath a little, when none looked;"

8083,SIXTH BOOK.,"I, Marian Erle, myself, alone, undone,"
8084,SIXTH BOOK.,"Facing a sunset low upon the flats,"
8085,SIXTH BOOK.,"As if it were the finish of all time,—"

8112,SEVENTH BOOK.,She found me a servant’s place in Paris where
8113,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I tried to take the cast-off life again,"

8117,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8118,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘A few months, so. My mistress, young and light,"

8150,SEVENTH BOOK.,Through all the heaving of impatient life
8151,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which threw me on death at intervals,—through all"

8158,SEVENTH BOOK.,And _I_ could be a mother in a month!
8159,SEVENTH BOOK.,I hope it was not wicked to be glad.
8160,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I lifted up my voice and wept, and laughed,"
8161,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To heaven, not her, until it tore my throat."
8162,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Confess, confess!’ what was there to confess,"
8163,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Except man’s cruelty, except my wrong?"
8164,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Except this anguish, or this ecstasy?"
8165,SEVENTH BOOK.,"This shame, or glory? The light woman there"
8166,SEVENTH BOOK.,Was small to take it in: an acorn-cup
8167,SEVENTH BOOK.,Would take the sea in sooner.
8168,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Good,’ she cried;"
8169,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Unmarried and a mother, and she laughs!"
8170,SEVENTH BOOK.,These unchaste girls are always impudent.
8171,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Get out, intriguer! leave my house, and trot:"

8173,SEVENTH BOOK.,With such a filthy secret.’
8174,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘Then I rolled
8175,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My scanty bundle up, and went my way,"
8176,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Washed white with weeping, shuddering head and foot"
8177,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With blind hysteric passion, staggering forth"
8178,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Beyond those doors. ’Twas natural, of course,"
8179,SEVENTH BOOK.,She should not ask me where I meant to sleep;
8180,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I might sleep well beneath the heavy Seine,"
8181,SEVENTH BOOK.,Like others of my sort; the bed was laid
8182,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For us. But any woman, womanly,"
8183,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Had thought of him who should be in a month,"
8184,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The sinless babe that should be in a month,"
8185,SEVENTH BOOK.,And if by chance he might be warmer housed
8186,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Than underneath such dreary, dripping eaves.’"
8187,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8188,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I broke on Marian there. ‘Yet she herself,"
8189,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A wife, I think, had scandals of her own,"
8190,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A lover, not her husband.’"
8191,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Ay,’ she said,"
8192,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘But gold and meal are measured otherwise;
8193,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I learnt so much at school,’ said Marian Erle."
8194,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8195,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘O crooked world,’ I cried, ‘ridiculous"
8196,SEVENTH BOOK.,If not so lamentable! It’s the way
8197,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With these light women of a thrifty vice,"
8198,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My Marian,—always hard upon the rent"
8199,SEVENTH BOOK.,In any sister’s virtue! while they keep
8200,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Their chastity so darned with perfidy,"
8201,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That, though a rag itself, it looks as well"
8202,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Across a street, in balcony or coach,"
8203,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As any stronger stuff might. For my part,"
8204,SEVENTH BOOK.,I’d rather take the wind-side of the stews
8205,SEVENTH BOOK.,Than touch such women with my finger-end!
8206,SEVENTH BOOK.,"They top the poor street-walker by their lie,"
8207,SEVENTH BOOK.,And look the better for being so much worse:
8208,SEVENTH BOOK.,The devil’s most devilish when respectable.
8209,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But you, dear, and your story.’"
8210,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘All the rest
8211,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is here,’ she said, and signed upon the child."
8212,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘I found a mistress-sempstress who was kind
8213,SEVENTH BOOK.,And let me sew in peace among her girls;
8214,SEVENTH BOOK.,And what was better than to draw the threads
8215,SEVENTH BOOK.,"All day and half the night, for him, and him?"
8216,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And so I lived for him, and so he lives,"
8217,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And so I know, by this time, God lives too.’"
8218,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8219,SEVENTH BOOK.,"She smiled beyond the sun, and ended so,"
8220,SEVENTH BOOK.,And all my soul rose up to take her part
8221,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Against the world’s successes, virtues, fames."
8222,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Come with me, sweetest sister,’ I returned,"
8223,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘And sit within my house, and do me good"
8224,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From henceforth, thou and thine! ye are my own"
8225,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From henceforth. I am lonely in the world,"
8226,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And thou art lonely, and the child is half"
8227,SEVENTH BOOK.,"An orphan. Come,—and, henceforth, thou and I"
8228,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Being still together, will not miss a friend,"
8229,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor he a father, since two mothers shall"
8230,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Make that up to him. I am journeying south,"
8231,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And, in my Tuscan home I’ll find a niche,"
8232,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And set thee there, my saint, the child and thee,"
8233,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And burn the lights of love before thy face,"
8234,SEVENTH BOOK.,And ever at thy sweet look cross myself
8235,SEVENTH BOOK.,From mixing with the world’s prosperities;
8236,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That so, in gravity and holy calm,"
8237,SEVENTH BOOK.,We two may live on toward the truer life.’
8238,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8239,SEVENTH BOOK.,"She looked me in the face and answered not,"
8240,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor signed she was unworthy, nor gave thanks,"
8241,SEVENTH BOOK.,But took the sleeping child and held it out
8242,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To meet my kiss, as if requiting me"
8243,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And trusting me at once. And thus, at once,"
8244,SEVENTH BOOK.,I carried him and her to where I lived;
8245,SEVENTH BOOK.,"She’s there now, in the little room, asleep,"
8246,SEVENTH BOOK.,I hear the soft child-breathing through the door;
8247,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And all three of us, at to-morrow’s break,"
8248,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Pass onward, homeward, to our Italy."
8249,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Oh, Romney Leigh, I have your debts to pay,"
8250,SEVENTH BOOK.,And I’ll be just and pay them.
8251,SEVENTH BOOK.,But yourself!
8252,SEVENTH BOOK.,To pay your debts is scarcely difficult;
8253,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To buy your life is nearly impossible,"
8254,SEVENTH BOOK.,Being sold away to Lamia. My head aches;
8255,SEVENTH BOOK.,I cannot see my road along this dark;
8256,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor can I creep and grope, as fits the dark,"
8257,SEVENTH BOOK.,For these foot-catching robes of womanhood:
8258,SEVENTH BOOK.,A man might walk a little ... but I!—He loves
8259,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The Lamia-woman,—and I, write to him"
8260,SEVENTH BOOK.,"What stops his marriage, and destroys his peace,—"
8261,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or what, perhaps, shall simply trouble him,"
8262,SEVENTH BOOK.,Until she only need to touch his sleeve
8263,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With just a finger’s tremulous white flame,"
8264,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Saying, ‘Ah,—Aurora Leigh! a pretty tale,"
8265,SEVENTH BOOK.,A very pretty poet! I can guess
8266,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The motive’—then, to catch his eyes in hers,"
8267,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And vow she does not wonder,—and they two"
8268,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To break in laughter, as the sea along"
8269,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A melancholy coast, and float up higher,"
8270,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In such a laugh, their fatal weeds of love!"
8271,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Ay, fatal, ay. And who shall answer me"
8272,SEVENTH BOOK.,Fate has not hurried tides; and if to-night
8273,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My letter would not be a night too late,—"
8274,SEVENTH BOOK.,"An arrow shot into a man that’s dead,"
8275,SEVENTH BOOK.,To prove a vain intention? Would I show
8276,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The new wife vile, to make the husband mad?"
8277,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No, Lamia! shut the shutters, bar the doors"
8278,SEVENTH BOOK.,From every glimmer on thy serpent-skin!
8279,SEVENTH BOOK.,I will not let thy hideous secret out
8280,SEVENTH BOOK.,To agonise the man I love—I mean
8281,SEVENTH BOOK.,The friend I love ... as friends love.
8282,SEVENTH BOOK.,"It is strange,"
8283,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To-day while Marian told her story, like"
8284,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To absorb most listeners, how I listened chief"
8285,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To a voice not hers, nor yet that enemy’s,"
8286,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor God’s in wrath, ... but one that mixed with mine"
8287,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Long years ago, among the garden-trees,"
8288,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And said to _me_, to _me_ too, ‘Be my wife,"
8289,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Aurora!’ It is strange, with what a swell"
8290,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of yearning passion, as snow of ghosts"
8291,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Might beat against the impervious doors of heaven,"
8292,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I thought, ‘Now, if I had been a woman, such"
8293,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As God made women, to save men by love,—"
8294,SEVENTH BOOK.,"By just my love I might have saved this man,"
8295,SEVENTH BOOK.,And made a nobler poem for the world
8296,SEVENTH BOOK.,Than all I have failed in.’ But I failed besides
8297,SEVENTH BOOK.,In this; and now he’s lost! through me alone!
8298,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And, by my only fault, his empty house"
8299,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Sucks in, at this same hour, a wind from hell"
8300,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To keep his hearth cold, make his casements creak"
8301,SEVENTH BOOK.,For ever to the tune of plague and sin—
8302,SEVENTH BOOK.,"O Romney, O my Romney, O my friend!"
8303,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My cousin and friend! my helper, when I would,"
8304,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My love, that might be! mine!"
8305,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Why, how one weeps"
8306,SEVENTH BOOK.,"When one’s too weary! Were a witness by,"
8307,SEVENTH BOOK.,"He’d say some folly ... that I loved the man,"
8308,SEVENTH BOOK.,Who knows?... and make me laugh again for scorn.
8309,SEVENTH BOOK.,"At strongest, women are as weak in flesh,"
8310,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As men, at weakest, vilest, are in soul:"
8311,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So, hard for women to keep pace with men!"
8312,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As well give up at once, sit down at once,"
8313,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And weep as I do. Tears, tears! _why_, we weep?"
8314,SEVENTH BOOK.,"’Tis worth enquiry?—That we’ve shamed a life,"
8315,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or lost a love, or missed a world, perhaps?"
8316,SEVENTH BOOK.,"By no means. Simply, that we’ve walked too far,"
8317,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or talked too much, or felt the wind i’ the east,—"
8318,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And so we weep, as if both body and soul"
8319,SEVENTH BOOK.,Broke up in water—this way.
8320,SEVENTH BOOK.,Poor mixed rags
8321,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Forsooth we’re made of, like those other dolls"
8322,SEVENTH BOOK.,That lean with pretty faces into fairs.
8323,SEVENTH BOOK.,"It seems as if I had a man in me,"
8324,SEVENTH BOOK.,Despising such a woman.
8325,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Yet indeed,"
8326,SEVENTH BOOK.,To see a wrong or suffering moves us all
8327,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To undo it, though we should undo ourselves;"
8328,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Ay, all the more, that we undo ourselves;"
8329,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That’s womanly, past doubt, and not ill-moved."
8330,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A natural movement, therefore, on my part,"
8331,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To fill the chair up of my cousin’s wife,"
8332,SEVENTH BOOK.,And save him from a devil’s company!
8333,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We’re all so,—made so—’tis our woman’s trade"
8334,SEVENTH BOOK.,To suffer torment for another’s ease.
8335,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The world’s male chivalry has perished out,"
8336,SEVENTH BOOK.,But women are knights-errant to the last;
8337,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And, if Cervantes had been greater still,"
8338,SEVENTH BOOK.,He had made his Don a Donna.
8339,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So it clears,"
8340,SEVENTH BOOK.,And so we rain our skies blue.
8341,SEVENTH BOOK.,Put away
8342,SEVENTH BOOK.,"This weakness. If, as I have just now said,"
8343,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A man’s within me,—let him act himself,"
8344,SEVENTH BOOK.,Ignoring the poor conscious trouble of blood
8345,SEVENTH BOOK.,That’s called the woman merely. I will write
8346,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Plain words to England,—if too late, too late,—"
8347,SEVENTH BOOK.,"If ill-accounted, then accounted ill;"
8348,SEVENTH BOOK.,We’ll trust the heavens with something.
8349,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Dear Lord Howe,"
8350,SEVENTH BOOK.,You’ll find a story on another leaf
8351,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That’s Marian Erle’s,—what noble friend of yours"
8352,SEVENTH BOOK.,"She trusted once, through what flagitious means"
8353,SEVENTH BOOK.,To what disastrous ends;—the story’s true.
8354,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I found her wandering on the Paris quays,"
8355,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A babe upon her breast,—unnatural"
8356,SEVENTH BOOK.,Unseasonable outcast on such snows
8357,SEVENTH BOOK.,Unthawed to this time. I will tax in this
8358,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Your friendship, friend,—if that convicted She"
8359,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Be not his wife yet, to denounce the facts"
8360,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To himself,—but, otherwise, to let them pass"
8361,SEVENTH BOOK.,"On tip-toe like escaping murderers,"
8362,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And tell my cousin, merely—Marian lives,"
8363,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is found, and finds her home with such a friend,"
8364,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Myself, Aurora. Which good news, ‘She’s found,’"
8365,SEVENTH BOOK.,Will help to make him merry in his love:
8366,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I send it, tell him, for my marriage gift,"
8367,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As good as orange-water for the nerves,"
8368,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or perfumed gloves for headaches,—though aware"
8369,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That he, except of love, is scarcely sick;"
8370,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I mean the new love this time, ... since last year."
8371,SEVENTH BOOK.,Such quick forgetting on the part of men!
8372,SEVENTH BOOK.,Is any shrewder trick upon the cards
8373,SEVENTH BOOK.,To enrich them? pray instruct me how it’s done.
8374,SEVENTH BOOK.,"First, clubs,—and while you look at clubs, it’s spades;"
8375,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That’s prodigy. The lightning strikes a man,"
8376,SEVENTH BOOK.,And when we think to find him dead and charred ...
8377,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Why, there he is on a sudden, playing pipes"
8378,SEVENTH BOOK.,Beneath the splintered elm-tree! Crime and shame
8379,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And all their hoggery trample your smooth world,"
8380,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor leave more foot-marks than Apollo’s kine,"
8381,SEVENTH BOOK.,Whose hoofs were muffled by the thieving god
8382,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In tamarisk-leaves and myrtle. I’m so sad,"
8383,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So weary and sad to-night, I’m somewhat sour,—"
8384,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Forgive me. To be blue and shrew at once,"
8385,SEVENTH BOOK.,Exceeds all toleration except yours;
8386,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But yours, I know, is infinite. Farewell."
8387,SEVENTH BOOK.,To-morrow we take train for Italy.
8388,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Speak gently of me to your gracious wife,"
8389,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As one, however far, shall yet be near"
8390,SEVENTH BOOK.,In loving wishes to your house.’
8391,SEVENTH BOOK.,I sign.
8392,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And now I’ll loose my heart upon a page,"
8393,SEVENTH BOOK.,This—
8394,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Lady Waldemar, I’m very glad"
8395,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I never liked you; which you knew so well,"
8396,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You spared me, in your turn, to like me much."
8397,SEVENTH BOOK.,Your liking surely had done worse for me
8398,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Than has your loathing, though the last appears"
8399,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Sufficiently unscrupulous to hurt,"
8400,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And not afraid of judgment. Now, there’s space"
8401,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Between our faces,—I stand off, as if"
8402,SEVENTH BOOK.,I judged a stranger’s portrait and pronounced
8403,SEVENTH BOOK.,Indifferently the type was good or bad:
8404,SEVENTH BOOK.,"What matter to me that the lines are false,"
8405,SEVENTH BOOK.,I ask you? Did I ever ink my lips
8406,SEVENTH BOOK.,"By drawing your name through them as a friend’s,"
8407,SEVENTH BOOK.,Or touch your hands as lovers do? thank God
8408,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I never did: and, since you’re proved so vile,"
8409,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Ay, vile, I say,—we’ll show it presently,—"
8410,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I’m not obliged to nurse my friend in you,"
8411,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or wash out my own blots, in counting yours,"
8412,SEVENTH BOOK.,Or even excuse myself to honest souls
8413,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Who seek to touch my lip or clasp my palm,—"
8414,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Alas, but Lady Waldemar came first!’"
8415,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘’Tis true, by this time, you may near me so"
8416,SEVENTH BOOK.,That you’re my cousin’s wife. You’ve gambled deep
8417,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As Lucifer, and won the morning-star"
8418,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In that case,—and the noble house of Leigh"
8419,SEVENTH BOOK.,Must henceforth with its good roof shelter you:
8420,SEVENTH BOOK.,I cannot speak and burn you up between
8421,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Those rafters, I who am born a Leigh,—nor speak"
8422,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And pierce your breast through Romney’s, I who live"
8423,SEVENTH BOOK.,"His friend and cousin!—so, you are safe. You two"
8424,SEVENTH BOOK.,Must grow together like the tares and wheat
8425,SEVENTH BOOK.,Till God’s great fire.—But make the best of time.
8426,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8427,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘And hide this letter! let it speak no more
8428,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Than I shall, how you tricked poor Marian Erle,"
8429,SEVENTH BOOK.,And set her own love digging her own grave
8430,SEVENTH BOOK.,Within her green hope’s pretty garden-ground;
8431,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Ay, sent her forth with some one of your sort"
8432,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To a wicked house in France,—from which she fled"
8433,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With curses in her eyes and ears and throat,"
8434,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Her whole soul choked with curses,—mad, in short,"
8435,SEVENTH BOOK.,And madly scouring up and down for weeks
8436,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The foreign hedgeless country, lone and lost,—"
8437,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So innocent, male-fiends might slink within"
8438,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Remote hell-corners, seeing her so defiled!"
8439,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8440,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘But you,—you are a woman and more bold."
8441,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To do you justice, you’d not shrink to face ..."
8442,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We’ll say, the unfledged life in the other room,"
8443,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which, treading down God’s corn, you trod in sight"
8444,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of all the dogs, in reach of all the guns,—"
8445,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Ay, Marian’s babe, her poor unfathered child,"
8446,SEVENTH BOOK.,Her yearling babe!—you’d face him when he wakes
8447,SEVENTH BOOK.,And opens up his wonderful blue eyes:
8448,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You’d meet them and not wink perhaps, nor fear"
8449,SEVENTH BOOK.,"God’s triumph in them and supreme revenge,"
8450,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So, righting His creation’s balance-scale"
8451,SEVENTH BOOK.,(You pulled as low as Tophet) to the top
8452,SEVENTH BOOK.,Of most celestial innocence! For me
8453,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Who am not as bold, I own those infant eyes"
8454,SEVENTH BOOK.,Have set me praying.
8455,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘While they look at heaven,"
8456,SEVENTH BOOK.,No need of protestation in my words
8457,SEVENTH BOOK.,Against the place you’ve made them! let them look!
8458,SEVENTH BOOK.,"They’ll do your business with the heavens, be sure:"
8459,SEVENTH BOOK.,I spare you common curses.
8460,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘Ponder this.
8461,SEVENTH BOOK.,"If haply you’re the wife of Romney Leigh,"
8462,SEVENTH BOOK.,(For which inheritance beyond your birth
8463,SEVENTH BOOK.,You sold that poisonous porridge called your soul)
8464,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I charge you, be his faithful and true wife!"
8465,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Keep warm his hearth and clean his board, and, when"
8466,SEVENTH BOOK.,"He speaks, be quick with your obedience;"
8467,SEVENTH BOOK.,Still grind your paltry wants and low desires
8468,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To dust beneath his heel; though, even thus,"
8469,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The ground must hurt him,—it was writ of old,"
8470,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Ye shall not yoke together ox and ass,’"
8471,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The nobler and ignobler. Ay, but you"
8472,SEVENTH BOOK.,Shall do your part as well as such ill things
8473,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Can do aught good. You shall not vex him,—mark,"
8474,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You shall not vex him, ... jar him when he’s sad,"
8475,SEVENTH BOOK.,Or cross him when he’s eager. Understand
8476,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To trick him with apparent sympathies,"
8477,SEVENTH BOOK.,Nor let him see thee in the face too near
8478,SEVENTH BOOK.,And unlearn thy sweet seeming. Pay the price
8479,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of lies, by being constrained to lie on still;"
8480,SEVENTH BOOK.,’Tis easy for thy sort: a million more
8481,SEVENTH BOOK.,Will scarcely damn thee deeper.
8482,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Doing which,"
8483,SEVENTH BOOK.,You are very safe from Marian and myself:
8484,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We’ll breathe as softly as the infant here,"
8485,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And stir no dangerous embers. Fail a point,"
8486,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And show our Romney wounded, ill-content,"
8487,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Tormented in his home, ... we open mouth,"
8488,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And such a noise will follow, the last trump’s"
8489,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Will scarcely seem more dreadful, even to you;"
8490,SEVENTH BOOK.,You’ll have no pipers after: Romney will
8491,SEVENTH BOOK.,"(I know him) push you forth as none of his,"
8492,SEVENTH BOOK.,All other men declaring it well done;
8493,SEVENTH BOOK.,"While women, even the worst, your like, will draw"
8494,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Their skirts back, not to brush you in the street;"
8495,SEVENTH BOOK.,And so I warn you. I’m ... Aurora Leigh.’
8496,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8497,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The letter written, I felt satisfied."
8498,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The ashes, smouldering in me, were thrown out"
8499,SEVENTH BOOK.,By handfuls from me: I had writ my heart
8500,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And wept my tears, and now was cool and calm;"
8501,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And, going straightway to the neighbouring room,"
8502,SEVENTH BOOK.,I lifted up the curtains of the bed
8503,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Where Marian Erle, the babe upon her arm,"
8504,SEVENTH BOOK.,Both faces leaned together like a pair
8505,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of folded innocences, self-complete,"
8506,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Each smiling from the other, smiled and slept."
8507,SEVENTH BOOK.,"There seemed no sin, no shame, no wrath, no grief."
8508,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I felt, she too, had spoken words that night,"
8509,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But softer certainly, and said to God,—"
8510,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Who laughs in heaven perhaps, that such as I"
8511,SEVENTH BOOK.,Should make ado for such as she.—‘Defiled’
8512,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I wrote? ‘defiled’ I thought her? Stoop,"
8513,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Stoop lower, Aurora! get the angels’ leave"
8514,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To creep in somewhere, humbly, on your knees,"
8515,SEVENTH BOOK.,Within this round of sequestration white
8516,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In which they have wrapt earth’s foundlings, heaven’s elect!"
8517,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8518,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The next day, we took train to Italy"
8519,SEVENTH BOOK.,And fled on southward in the roar of steam.
8520,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The marriage-bells of Romney must be loud,"
8521,SEVENTH BOOK.,To sound so clear through all! I was not well;
8522,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And truly, though the truth is like a jest,"
8523,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I could not choose but fancy, half the way,"
8524,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I stood alone i’ the belfry, fifty bells"
8525,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of naked iron, mad with merriment,"
8526,SEVENTH BOOK.,(As one who laughs and cannot stop himself)
8527,SEVENTH BOOK.,"All clanking at me, in me, over me,"
8528,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Until I shrieked a shriek I could not hear,"
8529,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And swooned with noise,—but still, along my swoon,"
8530,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Was ’ware the baffled changes backward rang,"
8531,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Prepared, at each emerging sense, to beat"
8532,SEVENTH BOOK.,And crash it out with clangour. I was weak;
8533,SEVENTH BOOK.,I struggled for the posture of my soul
8534,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In upright consciousness of place and time,"
8535,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But evermore, ’twixt waking and asleep,"
8536,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Slipped somehow, staggered, caught at Marian’s eyes"
8537,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A moment, (it is very good for strength"
8538,SEVENTH BOOK.,To know that some one needs you to be strong)
8539,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And so recovered what I called myself,"
8540,SEVENTH BOOK.,For that time.
8541,SEVENTH BOOK.,I just knew it when we swept
8542,SEVENTH BOOK.,Above the old roofs of Dijon. Lyons dropped
8543,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A spark into the night, half trodden out"
8544,SEVENTH BOOK.,Unseen. But presently the winding Rhone
8545,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Washed out the moonlight large along his banks,"
8546,SEVENTH BOOK.,Which strained their yielding curves out clear and clean
8547,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To hold it,—shadow of town and castle blurred"
8548,SEVENTH BOOK.,Upon the hurrying river. Such an air
8549,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Blew thence upon the forehead,—half an air"
8550,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And half a water,—that I leaned and looked;"
8551,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Then, turning back on Marian, smiled to mark"
8552,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That she looked only on her child, who slept,"
8553,SEVENTH BOOK.,His face towards the moon too.
8554,SEVENTH BOOK.,So we passed
8555,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The liberal open country and the close,"
8556,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And shot through tunnels, like a lightning-wedge"
8557,SEVENTH BOOK.,"By great Thor-hammers driven through the rock,"
8558,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which, quivering through the intestine blackness, splits,"
8559,SEVENTH BOOK.,And lets it in at once: the train swept in
8560,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Athrob with effort, trembling with resolve,"
8561,SEVENTH BOOK.,The fierce denouncing whistle wailing on
8562,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And dying off smothered in the shuddering dark,"
8563,SEVENTH BOOK.,"While we, self-awed, drew troubled breath, oppressed"
8564,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As other Titans, underneath the pile"
8565,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And nightmare of the mountains. Out, at last,"
8566,SEVENTH BOOK.,To catch the dawn afloat upon the land!
8567,SEVENTH BOOK.,"—Hills, slung forth broadly and gauntly everywhere,"
8568,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Not crampt in their foundations, pushing wide"
8569,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Rich outspreads of the vineyards and the corn,"
8570,SEVENTH BOOK.,(As if they entertained i’ the name of France)
8571,SEVENTH BOOK.,"While, down their straining sides, streamed manifest"
8572,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A soil as red as Charlemagne’s knightly blood,"
8573,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To consecrate the verdure. Some one said,"
8574,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Marseilles!’ And lo, the city of Marseilles,"
8575,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With all her ships behind her, and beyond,"
8576,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The scimitar of ever-shining sea,"
8577,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For right-hand use, bared blue against the sky!"
8578,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8579,SEVENTH BOOK.,That night we spent between the purple heaven
8580,SEVENTH BOOK.,And purple water: I think Marian slept;
8581,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But I, as a dog a-watch for his master’s foot,"
8582,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Who cannot sleep or eat before he hears,"
8583,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I sate upon the deck and watched all night,"
8584,SEVENTH BOOK.,And listened through the stars for Italy.
8585,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Those marriage-bells I spoke of, sounded far,"
8586,SEVENTH BOOK.,As some child’s go-cart in the street beneath
8587,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To a dying man who will not pass the day,"
8588,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And knows it, holding by a hand he loves."
8589,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I, too, sate quiet, satisfied with death,"
8590,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Sate silent: I could hear my own soul speak,"
8591,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And had my friend,—for Nature comes sometimes"
8592,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And says, ‘I am ambassador for God.’"
8593,SEVENTH BOOK.,I felt the wind soft from the land of souls;
8594,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The old miraculous mountains heaved in sight,"
8595,SEVENTH BOOK.,"One straining past another along the shore,"
8596,SEVENTH BOOK.,The way of grand dull Odyssean ghosts
8597,SEVENTH BOOK.,Athirst to drink the cool blue wine of seas
8598,SEVENTH BOOK.,And stare on voyagers. Peak pushing peak
8599,SEVENTH BOOK.,They stood: I watched beyond that Tyrian belt
8600,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of intense sea betwixt them and the ship,"
8601,SEVENTH BOOK.,Down all their sides the misty olive-woods
8602,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Dissolving in the weak congenial moon,"
8603,SEVENTH BOOK.,And still disclosing some brown convent-tower
8604,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That seems as if it grew from some brown rock,—"
8605,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or many a little lighted village, dropt"
8606,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Like a fallen star, upon so high a point,"
8607,SEVENTH BOOK.,You wonder what can keep it in its place
8608,SEVENTH BOOK.,From sliding headlong with the waterfalls
8609,SEVENTH BOOK.,Which drop and powder all the myrtle-groves
8610,SEVENTH BOOK.,With spray of silver. Thus my Italy
8611,SEVENTH BOOK.,Was stealing on us. Genoa broke with day;
8612,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The Doria’s long pale palace striking out,"
8613,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From green hills in advance of the white town,"
8614,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A marble finger dominant to ships,"
8615,SEVENTH BOOK.,Seen glimmering through the uncertain grey of dawn.
8616,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8617,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But then I did not think, ‘my Italy,’"
8618,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I thought, ‘my father!’ O my father’s house,"
8619,SEVENTH BOOK.,Without his presence!—Places are too much
8620,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or else too little, for immortal man;"
8621,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Too little, when love’s May o’ergrows the ground,—"
8622,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Too much, when that luxuriant wealth of green"
8623,SEVENTH BOOK.,Is rustling to our ankles in dead leaves.
8624,SEVENTH BOOK.,"’Tis only good to be, or here or there,"
8625,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Because we had a dream on such a stone,"
8626,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or this or that,—but, once beings wholly waked,"
8627,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And come back to the stone without the dream,"
8628,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We trip upon’t,—alas! and hurt ourselves;"
8629,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or else it falls on us and grinds us flat,"
8630,SEVENTH BOOK.,The heaviest grave-stone on this burying earth.
8631,SEVENTH BOOK.,"—But while I stood and mused, a quiet touch"
8632,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Fell light upon my arm, and, turning round,"
8633,SEVENTH BOOK.,A pair of moistened eyes convicted mine.
8634,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘What, Marian! is the babe astir so soon?’"
8635,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘He sleeps,’ she answered; ‘I have crept up thrice,"
8636,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And seen you sitting, standing, still at watch."
8637,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I thought it did you good till now, but now’ ..."
8638,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘But now,’ I said, ‘you leave the child alone.’"
8639,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘And _you’re_ alone,’ she answered,—and she looked"
8640,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As if I, too, were something. Sweet the help"
8641,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of one we have helped! Thanks, Marian, for that help."
8642,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8643,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I found a house, at Florence, on the hill"
8644,SEVENTH BOOK.,Of Bellosguardo. ’Tis a tower that keeps
8645,SEVENTH BOOK.,A post of double-observation o’er
8646,SEVENTH BOOK.,The valley of Arno (holding as a hand
8647,SEVENTH BOOK.,The outspread city) straight toward Fiesole
8648,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And Mount Morello and the setting sun,—"
8649,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The Vallombrosan mountains to the right,"
8650,SEVENTH BOOK.,Which sunrise fills as full as crystal cups
8651,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Wine-filled, and red to the brim because it’s red."
8652,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No sun could die, nor yet be born, unseen"
8653,SEVENTH BOOK.,By dwellers at my villa: morn and eve
8654,SEVENTH BOOK.,Were magnified before us in the pure
8655,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Illimitable space and pause of sky,"
8656,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Intense as angels’ garments blanched with God,"
8657,SEVENTH BOOK.,Less blue than radiant. From the outer wall
8658,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of the garden, dropped the mystic floating grey"
8659,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of olive-trees, (with interruptions green"
8660,SEVENTH BOOK.,From maize and vine) until ’twas caught and torn
8661,SEVENTH BOOK.,On that abrupt black line of cypresses
8662,SEVENTH BOOK.,Which signed the way to Florence. Beautiful
8663,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The city lay along the ample vale,"
8664,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Cathedral, tower and palace, piazza and street;"
8665,SEVENTH BOOK.,The river trailing like a silver cord
8666,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Through all, and curling loosely, both before"
8667,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And after, over the whole stretch of land"
8668,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Sown whitely up and down its opposite slopes,"
8669,SEVENTH BOOK.,With farms and villas.
8670,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Many weeks had passed,"
8671,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No word was granted.—Last, a letter came"
8672,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From Vincent Carrington:—‘My dear Miss Leigh,"
8673,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You’ve been as silent as a poet should,"
8674,SEVENTH BOOK.,When any other man is sure to speak.
8675,SEVENTH BOOK.,"If sick, if vexed, if dumb, a silver-piece"
8676,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Will split a man’s tongue,—straight he speaks and says,"
8677,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘Received that cheque.’ But you!... I send you funds
8678,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To Paris, and you make no sign at all."
8679,SEVENTH BOOK.,Remember I’m responsible and wait
8680,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A sign of you, Miss Leigh."
8681,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘Meantime your book
8682,SEVENTH BOOK.,Is eloquent as if you were not dumb;
8683,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And common critics, ordinarily deaf"
8684,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To such fine meanings, and, like deaf men, loth"
8685,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To seem deaf, answering chance-wise, yes or no,"
8686,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘It must be,’ or ‘it must not,’ (most pronounced"
8687,SEVENTH BOOK.,When least convinced) pronounce for once aright:
8688,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You’d think they really heard,—and so they do ..."
8689,SEVENTH BOOK.,The burr of three or four who really hear
8690,SEVENTH BOOK.,And praise your book aright: Fame’s smallest trump
8691,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is a great ear-trumpet for the deaf as posts,"
8692,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No other being effective. Fear not, friend;"
8693,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We think, here, you have written a good book,"
8694,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And you, a woman! It was in you—yes,"
8695,SEVENTH BOOK.,I felt ’twas in you: yet I doubted half
8696,SEVENTH BOOK.,If that od-force of German Reichenbach
8697,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which still from female finger-tips burns blue,"
8698,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Could strike out, as our masculine white heats,"
8699,SEVENTH BOOK.,To quicken a man. Forgive me. All my heart
8700,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is quick with yours, since, just a fortnight since,"
8701,SEVENTH BOOK.,I read your book and loved it.
8702,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘Will you love
8703,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My wife, too? Here’s my secret, I might keep"
8704,SEVENTH BOOK.,A month more from you! but I yield it up
8705,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Because I know you’ll write the sooner for’t,—"
8706,SEVENTH BOOK.,Most women (of your height even) counting love
8707,SEVENTH BOOK.,Life’s only serious business. Who’s my wife
8708,SEVENTH BOOK.,That shall be in a month? you ask? nor guess?
8709,SEVENTH BOOK.,Remember what a pair of topaz eyes
8710,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You once detected, turned against the wall,"
8711,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That morning, in my London painting-room;"
8712,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The face half-sketched, and slurred; the eyes alone!"
8713,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But you ... you caught them up with yours, and said"
8714,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Kate Ward’s eyes, surely.’—Now, I own the truth,"
8715,SEVENTH BOOK.,I had thrown them there to keep them safe from Jove;
8716,SEVENTH BOOK.,They would so naughtily find out their way
8717,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To both the heads of both my Danaës,"
8718,SEVENTH BOOK.,Where just it made me mad to look at them.
8719,SEVENTH BOOK.,Such eyes! I could not paint or think of eyes
8720,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But those,—and so I flung them into paint"
8721,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And turned them to the wall’s care. Ay, but now"
8722,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I’ve let them out, my Kate’s! I’ve painted her,"
8723,SEVENTH BOOK.,"(I’ll change my style, and leave mythologies)"
8724,SEVENTH BOOK.,The whole sweet face; it looks upon my soul
8725,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Like a face on water, to beget itself."
8726,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A half-length portrait, in a hanging cloak"
8727,SEVENTH BOOK.,Like one you wore once; ’tis a little frayed;
8728,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I pressed, too, for the nude harmonious arm—"
8729,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But she ... she’d have her way, and have her cloak;"
8730,SEVENTH BOOK.,"She said she could be like you only so,"
8731,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And would not miss the fortune. Ah, my friend,"
8732,SEVENTH BOOK.,You’ll write and say she shall not miss your love
8733,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Through meeting mine? in faith, she would not change:"
8734,SEVENTH BOOK.,"She has your books by heart, more than my words,"
8735,SEVENTH BOOK.,And quotes you up against me till I’m pushed
8736,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Where, three months since, her eyes were! nay, in fact,"
8737,SEVENTH BOOK.,Nought satisfied her but to make me paint
8738,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Your last book folded in her dimpled hands,"
8739,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Instead of my brown palette, as I wished,"
8740,SEVENTH BOOK.,"(And, grant me, the presentment had been newer)"
8741,SEVENTH BOOK.,She’d grant me nothing: I’ve compounded for
8742,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The naming of the wedding-day next month,"
8743,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And gladly too. ’Tis pretty, to remark"
8744,SEVENTH BOOK.,"How women can love women of your sort,"
8745,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And tie their hearts with love-knots to your feet,"
8746,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Grow insolent about you against men,"
8747,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And put us down by putting up the lip,"
8748,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As if a man,—there _are_ such, let us own,"
8749,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Who write not ill,—remains a man, poor wretch,"
8750,SEVENTH BOOK.,"While you——! Write far worse than Aurora Leigh,"
8751,SEVENTH BOOK.,And there’ll be women who believe of you
8752,SEVENTH BOOK.,(Besides my Kate) that if you walked on sand
8753,SEVENTH BOOK.,You would not leave a foot-print.
8754,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘Are you put
8755,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To wonder by my marriage, like poor Leigh?"
8756,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘Kate Ward!’ he said. ‘Kate Ward!’ he said anew.
8757,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘I thought ...’ he said, and stopped,—‘I did not think....’"
8758,SEVENTH BOOK.,And then he dropped to silence.
8759,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘Ah, he’s changed."
8760,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I had not seen him, you’re aware, for long,"
8761,SEVENTH BOOK.,But went of course. I have not touched on this
8762,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Through all this letter,—conscious of your heart,"
8763,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And writing lightlier for the heavy fact,"
8764,SEVENTH BOOK.,As clocks are voluble with lead.
8765,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘How weak,"
8766,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To say I’m sorry. Dear Leigh, dearest Leigh!"
8767,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In those old days of Shropshire,—pardon me,—"
8768,SEVENTH BOOK.,When he and you fought many a field of gold
8769,SEVENTH BOOK.,"On what you should do, or you should not do,"
8770,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Make bread or verses, (it just came to that)"
8771,SEVENTH BOOK.,I thought you’d one day draw a silken peace
8772,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Through a golden ring. I thought so. Foolishly,"
8773,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The event proved,—for you went more opposite"
8774,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To each other, month by month, and year by year,"
8775,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Until this happened. God knows best, we say,"
8776,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But hoarsely. When the fever took him first,"
8777,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Just after I had writ to you in France,"
8778,SEVENTH BOOK.,They tell me Lady Waldemar mixed drinks
8779,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And counted grains, like any salaried nurse,"
8780,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Excepting that she wept too. Then Lord Howe,"
8781,SEVENTH BOOK.,You’re right about Lord Howe! Lord Howe’s a trump;
8782,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And yet, with such in his hand, a man like Leigh"
8783,SEVENTH BOOK.,"May lose, as _he_ does. There’s an end to all,—"
8784,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Yes, even this letter, though the second sheet"
8785,SEVENTH BOOK.,May find you doubtful. Write a word for Kate:
8786,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Even now she reads my letters like a wife,"
8787,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And, if she sees her name, I’ll see her smile,"
8788,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And share the luck. So, bless you, friend of two!"
8789,SEVENTH BOOK.,I will not ask you what your feeling is
8790,SEVENTH BOOK.,"At Florence, with my pictures. I can hear"
8791,SEVENTH BOOK.,Your heart a-flutter over the snow-hills;
8792,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And, just to pace the Pitti with you once,"
8793,SEVENTH BOOK.,I’d give a half-hour of to-morrow’s walk
8794,SEVENTH BOOK.,With Kate ... I think so. Vincent Carrington.’
8795,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8796,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The noon was hot; the air scorched like the sun,"
8797,SEVENTH BOOK.,And was shut out. The closed persiani threw
8798,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Their long-scored shadows on my villa-floor,"
8799,SEVENTH BOOK.,And interlined the golden atmosphere
8800,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Straight, still,—across the pictures on the wall,"
8801,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The statuette on the console, (of young Love"
8802,SEVENTH BOOK.,And Psyche made one marble by a kiss)
8803,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The low couch where I leaned, the table near,"
8804,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The vase of lilies, Marian pulled last night,"
8805,SEVENTH BOOK.,(Each green leaf and each white leaf ruled in black
8806,SEVENTH BOOK.,As if for writing some new text of fate)
8807,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And the open letter, rested on my knee,—"
8808,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But there, the lines swerved, trembled, though I sate"
8809,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Untroubled ... plainly, ... reading it again"
8810,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And three times. Well, he’s married; that is clear."
8811,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No wonder that he’s married, nor much more"
8812,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That Vincent’s therefore, ‘sorry.’ Why, of course,"
8813,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The lady nursed him when he was not well,"
8814,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Mixed drinks,—unless nepenthe was the drink,"
8815,SEVENTH BOOK.,’Twas scarce worth telling. But a man in love
8816,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Will see the whole sex in his mistress’ hood,"
8817,SEVENTH BOOK.,The prettier for its lining of fair rose;
8818,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Although he catches back, and says at last,"
8819,SEVENTH BOOK.,‘I’m sorry.’ Sorry. Lady Waldemar
8820,SEVENTH BOOK.,"At prettiest, under the said hood, preserved"
8821,SEVENTH BOOK.,From such a light as I could hold to her face
8822,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To flare its ugly wrinkles out to shame,—"
8823,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is scarce a wife for Romney, as friends judge,"
8824,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Aurora Leigh, or Vincent Carrington,—"
8825,SEVENTH BOOK.,That’s plain. And if he’s ‘conscious of my heart’ ...
8826,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Perhaps it’s natural, though the phrase is strong;"
8827,SEVENTH BOOK.,"(One’s apt to use strong phrases, being in love)"
8828,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And even that stuff of ‘fields of gold,’ ‘gold rings,’"
8829,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And what he ‘thought,’ poor Vincent! what he ‘thought,’"
8830,SEVENTH BOOK.,May never mean enough to ruffle me.
8831,SEVENTH BOOK.,"—Why, this room stifles. Better burn than choke;"
8832,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Best have air, air, although it comes with fire,"
8833,SEVENTH BOOK.,Throw open blinds and windows to the noon
8834,SEVENTH BOOK.,And take a blister on my brow instead
8835,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of this dead weight! best, perfectly be stunned"
8836,SEVENTH BOOK.,"By those insufferable cicale, sick"
8837,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And hoarse with rapture of the summer-heat,"
8838,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That sing like poets, till their hearts break, ... sing"
8839,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Till men say, ‘It’s too tedious.’"
8840,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Books succeed,"
8841,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And lives fail. Do I feel it so, at last?"
8842,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Kate loves a worn-out cloak for being like mine,"
8843,SEVENTH BOOK.,"While I live self-despised for being myself,"
8844,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And yearn toward some one else, who yearns away"
8845,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From what he is, in his turn. Strain a step"
8846,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For ever, yet gain no step? Are we such,"
8847,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We cannot, with our admirations even,"
8848,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Our tip-toe aspirations, touch a thing"
8849,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That’s higher than we? is all a dismal flat,"
8850,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And God alone above each,—as the sun"
8851,SEVENTH BOOK.,"O’er level lagunes, to make them shine and stink,—"
8852,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Laying stress upon us with immediate flame,"
8853,SEVENTH BOOK.,"While we respond with our miasmal fog,"
8854,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And call it mounting higher, because we grow"
8855,SEVENTH BOOK.,More highly fatal?
8856,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Tush, Aurora Leigh!"
8857,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You wear your sackcloth looped in Cæsar’s way,"
8858,SEVENTH BOOK.,And brag your failings as mankind’s. Be still.
8859,SEVENTH BOOK.,"There _is_ what’s higher, in this very world,"
8860,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Than you can live, or catch at. Stand aside,"
8861,SEVENTH BOOK.,And look at others—instance little Kate!
8862,SEVENTH BOOK.,She’ll make a perfect wife for Carrington.
8863,SEVENTH BOOK.,She always has been looking round the earth
8864,SEVENTH BOOK.,For something good and green to alight upon
8865,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And nestle into, with those soft-winged eyes"
8866,SEVENTH BOOK.,Subsiding now beneath his manly hand
8867,SEVENTH BOOK.,’Twixt trembling lids of inexpressive joy:
8868,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I will not scorn her, after all, too much,"
8869,SEVENTH BOOK.,That so much she should love me. A wise man
8870,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Can pluck a leaf, and find a lecture in ’t;"
8871,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And I, too, ... God has made me,—I’ve a heart"
8872,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That’s capable of worship, love, and loss;"
8873,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We say the same of Shakspeare’s. I’ll be meek,"
8874,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And learn to reverence, even this poor myself."
8875,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8876,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The book, too—pass it. ‘A good book,’ says he,"
8877,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘And you a woman.’ I had laughed at that,"
8878,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But long since. I’m a woman,—it is true;"
8879,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Alas, and woe to us, when we feel it most!"
8880,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Then, least care have we for the crowns and goals,"
8881,SEVENTH BOOK.,And compliments on writing our good books.
8882,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8883,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The book has some truth in it, I believe:"
8884,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And truth outlives pain, as the soul does life."
8885,SEVENTH BOOK.,I know we talk our Phædons to the end
8886,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Through all the dismal faces that we make,"
8887,SEVENTH BOOK.,O’er-wrinkled with dishonouring agony
8888,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From any mortal drug. I have written truth,"
8889,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And I a woman; feebly, partially,"
8890,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Inaptly in presentation, Romney’ll add,"
8891,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Because a woman. For the truth itself,"
8892,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That’s neither man’s nor woman’s, but just God’s;"
8893,SEVENTH BOOK.,None else has reason to be proud of truth:
8894,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Himself will see it sifted, disenthralled,"
8895,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And kept upon the height and in the light,"
8896,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As far as, and no farther, than ’tis truth;"
8897,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For,—now He has left off calling firmaments"
8898,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And strata, flowers and creatures, very good,—"
8899,SEVENTH BOOK.,"He says it still of truth, which is His own."
8900,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8901,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Truth, so far, in my book;—the truth which draws"
8902,SEVENTH BOOK.,Through all things upwards; that a twofold world
8903,SEVENTH BOOK.,Must go to a perfect cosmos. Natural things
8904,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And spiritual,—who separates those two"
8905,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In art, in morals, or the social drift,"
8906,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Tears up the bond of nature and brings death,"
8907,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Paints futile pictures, writes unreal verse,"
8908,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Leads vulgar days, deals ignorantly with men,"
8909,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is wrong, in short, at all points. We divide"
8910,SEVENTH BOOK.,"This apple of life, and cut it through the pips,—"
8911,SEVENTH BOOK.,The perfect round which fitted Venus’ hand
8912,SEVENTH BOOK.,Has perished utterly as if we ate
8913,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Both halves. Without the spiritual, observe,"
8914,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The natural’s impossible;—no form,"
8915,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No motion! Without sensuous, spiritual"
8916,SEVENTH BOOK.,Is inappreciable;—no beauty or power!
8917,SEVENTH BOOK.,And in this twofold sphere the twofold man
8918,SEVENTH BOOK.,(And still the artist is intensely a man)
8919,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Holds firmly by the natural, to reach"
8920,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The spiritual beyond it,—fixes still"
8921,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The type with mortal vision, to pierce through,"
8922,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With eyes immortal, to the antetype"
8923,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Some call the ideal,—better called the real,"
8924,SEVENTH BOOK.,And certain to be called so presently
8925,SEVENTH BOOK.,When things shall have their names. Look long enough
8926,SEVENTH BOOK.,"On any peasant’s face here, coarse and lined,"
8927,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You’ll catch Antinous somewhere in that clay,"
8928,SEVENTH BOOK.,As perfect-featured as he yearns at Rome
8929,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From marble pale with beauty; then persist,"
8930,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And, if your apprehension’s competent,"
8931,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You’ll find some fairer angel at his back,"
8932,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As much exceeding him, as he the boor,"
8933,SEVENTH BOOK.,And pushing him with empyreal disdain
8934,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For ever out of sight. Ay, Carrington"
8935,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is glad of such a creed! an artist must,"
8936,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Who paints a tree, a leaf, a common stone,"
8937,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With just his hand, and finds it suddenly"
8938,SEVENTH BOOK.,A-piece with and conterminous to his soul.
8939,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Why else do these things move him, leaf or stone?"
8940,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The bird’s not moved, that pecks at a spring-shoot;"
8941,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor yet the horse, before a quarry, a-graze:"
8942,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But man, the two-fold creature, apprehends"
8943,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The two-fold manner, in and outwardly,"
8944,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And nothing in the world comes single to him,"
8945,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A mere itself,—cup, column, or candlestick,"
8946,SEVENTH BOOK.,All patterns of what shall be in the Mount;
8947,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The whole temporal show related royally,"
8948,SEVENTH BOOK.,And built up to eterne significance
8949,SEVENTH BOOK.,Through the open arms of God. ‘There’s nothing great
8950,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor small,’ has said a poet of our day,"
8951,SEVENTH BOOK.,(Whose voice will ring beyond the curfew of eve
8952,SEVENTH BOOK.,And not be thrown out by the matin’s bell)
8953,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And truly, I reiterate, ... nothing’s small!"
8954,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No lily-muffled hum of a summer-bee,"
8955,SEVENTH BOOK.,But finds some coupling with the spinning stars;
8956,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No pebble at your foot, but proves a sphere;"
8957,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No chaffinch, but implies the cherubim:"
8958,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And,—glancing on my own thin, veinéd wrist,—"
8959,SEVENTH BOOK.,In such a little tremour of the blood
8960,SEVENTH BOOK.,The whole strong clamour of a vehement soul
8961,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Doth utter itself distinct. Earth’s crammed with heaven,"
8962,SEVENTH BOOK.,And every common bush afire with God:
8963,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But only he who sees, takes off his shoes;"
8964,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The rest sit round it, and pluck blackberries,"
8965,SEVENTH BOOK.,And daub their natural faces unaware
8966,SEVENTH BOOK.,"More and more, from the first similitude."
8967,SEVENTH BOOK.,
8968,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Truth, so far, in my book! a truth which draws"
8969,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From all things upwards. I, Aurora, still"
8970,SEVENTH BOOK.,Have felt it hound me through the wastes of life
8971,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As Jove did Io: and, until that Hand"
8972,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Shall overtake me wholly, and, on my head,"
8973,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Lay down its large unfluctuating peace,"
8974,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The feverish gad-fly pricks me up and down,"
8975,SEVENTH BOOK.,It must be. Art’s the witness of what Is
8976,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Behind this show. If this world’s show were all,"
8977,SEVENTH BOOK.,Then imitation would be all in Art;
8978,SEVENTH BOOK.,"There, Jove’s hand gripes us!—For we stand here, we,"
8979,SEVENTH BOOK.,"If genuine artists, witnessing for God’s"
8980,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Complete, consummate, undivided work:"
8981,SEVENTH BOOK.,"—That not a natural flower can grow on earth,"
8982,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Without a flower upon the spiritual side,"
8983,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Substantial, archetypal, all a-glow"
8984,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With blossoming causes,—not so far away,"
8985,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That we, whose spirit-sense is somewhat cleared,"
8986,SEVENTH BOOK.,"May not catch something of the bloom and breath,—"
8987,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Too vaguely apprehended, though indeed"
8988,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Still apprehended, consciously or not,"
8989,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And still transferred to picture, music, verse,"
8990,SEVENTH BOOK.,For thrilling audient and beholding souls
8991,SEVENTH BOOK.,"By signs and touches which are known to souls,—"
8992,SEVENTH BOOK.,"How known, they know not,—why, they cannot find,"
8993,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So straight call out on genius, say, ‘A man"
8994,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Produced this,’—when much rather they should say,"
8995,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘’Tis insight, and he saw this.’"
8996,SEVENTH BOOK.,Thus is Art
8997,SEVENTH BOOK.,Self-magnified in magnifying a truth
8998,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which, fully recognised, would change the world"
8999,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And shift its morals. If a man could feel,"
9000,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Not one day, in the artist’s ecstasy,"
9001,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But every day, feast, fast, or working-day,"
9002,SEVENTH BOOK.,The spiritual significance burn through
9003,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The hieroglyphic of material shows,"
9004,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Henceforward he would paint the globe with wings,"
9005,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And reverence fish and fowl, the bull, the tree,"
9006,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And even his very body as a man,—"
9007,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which now he counts so vile, that all the towns"
9008,SEVENTH BOOK.,Make offal of their daughters for its use
9009,SEVENTH BOOK.,"On summer-nights, when God is sad in heaven"
9010,SEVENTH BOOK.,To think what goes on in his recreant world
9011,SEVENTH BOOK.,He made quite other; while that moon He made
9012,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To shine there, at the first love’s covenant,"
9013,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Shines still, convictive as a marriage-ring"
9014,SEVENTH BOOK.,Before adulterous eyes.
9015,SEVENTH BOOK.,"How sure it is,"
9016,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That, if we say a true word, instantly"
9017,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We feel ’tis God’s, not ours, and pass it on"
9018,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As bread at sacrament, we taste and pass"
9019,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Nor handle for a moment, as indeed"
9020,SEVENTH BOOK.,We dared to set up any claim to such!
9021,SEVENTH BOOK.,And I—my poem;—let my readers talk;
9022,SEVENTH BOOK.,I’m closer to it—I can speak as well:
9023,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I’ll say, with Romney, that the book is weak,"
9024,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The range uneven, the points of sight obscure,"
9025,SEVENTH BOOK.,The music interrupted.
9026,SEVENTH BOOK.,Let us go.
9027,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The end of woman (or of man, I think)"
9028,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is not a book. Alas, the best of books"
9029,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is but a word in Art, which soon grows cramped,"
9030,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Stiff, dubious-statured with the weight of years,"
9031,SEVENTH BOOK.,And drops an accent or digamma down
9032,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Some cranny of unfathomable time,"
9033,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Beyond the critic’s reaching. Art itself,"
9034,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We’ve called the higher life, still must feel the soul"
9035,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Live past it. For more’s felt than is perceived,"
9036,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And more’s perceived than can be interpreted,"
9037,SEVENTH BOOK.,And Love strikes higher with his lambent flame
9038,SEVENTH BOOK.,Than Art can pile the faggots.
9039,SEVENTH BOOK.,Is it so?
9040,SEVENTH BOOK.,"When Jove’s hand meets us with composing touch,"
9041,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And when, at last, we are hushed and satisfied,—"
9042,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Then, Io does not call it truth, but love?"
9043,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Well, well! my father was an Englishman:"
9044,SEVENTH BOOK.,My mother’s blood in me is not so strong
9045,SEVENTH BOOK.,That I should bear this stress of Tuscan noon
9046,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And keep my wits. The town, there, seems to seethe"
9047,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In this Medæan boil-pot of the sun,"
9048,SEVENTH BOOK.,And all the patient hills are bubbling round
9049,SEVENTH BOOK.,As if a prick would leave them flat. Does heaven
9050,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Keep far off, not to set us in a blaze?"
9051,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Not so,—let drag your fiery fringes, heaven,"
9052,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And burn us up to quiet! Ah, we know"
9053,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Too much here, not to know what’s best for peace;"
9054,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We have too much light here, not to want more fire"
9055,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To purify and end us. We talk, talk,"
9056,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Conclude upon divine philosophies,"
9057,SEVENTH BOOK.,And get the thanks of men for hopeful books;
9058,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Whereat we take our own life up, and ... pshaw!"
9059,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Unless we piece it with another’s life,"
9060,SEVENTH BOOK.,(A yard of silk to carry out our lawn)
9061,SEVENTH BOOK.,As well suppose my little handkerchief
9062,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Would cover Samminiato, church and all,"
9063,SEVENTH BOOK.,"If out I threw it past the cypresses,"
9064,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As, in this ragged, narrow life of mine,"
9065,SEVENTH BOOK.,Contain my own conclusions.
9066,SEVENTH BOOK.,But at least
9067,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We’ll shut up the persiani, and sit down,"
9068,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And when my head’s done aching, in the cool,"
9069,SEVENTH BOOK.,Write just a word to Kate and Carrington.
9070,SEVENTH BOOK.,"May joy be with them! she has chosen well,"
9071,SEVENTH BOOK.,And he not ill.
9072,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I should be glad, I think,"
9073,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Except for Romney. Had _he_ married Kate,"
9074,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I surely, surely, should be very glad."
9075,SEVENTH BOOK.,"This Florence sits upon me easily,"
9076,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With native air and tongue. My graves are calm,"
9077,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And do not too much hurt me. Marian’s good,"
9078,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Gentle and loving,—lets me hold the child,"
9079,SEVENTH BOOK.,Or drags him up the hills to find me flowers
9080,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And fill those vases, ere I’m quite awake,—"
9081,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The grandiose red tulips, which grow wild,"
9082,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or else my purple lilies, Dante blew"
9083,SEVENTH BOOK.,To a larger bubble with his prophet-breath;
9084,SEVENTH BOOK.,Or one of those tall flowering reeds which stand
9085,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In Arno like a sheaf of sceptres, left"
9086,SEVENTH BOOK.,"By some remote dynasty of dead gods,"
9087,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To suck the stream for ages and get green,"
9088,SEVENTH BOOK.,And blossom wheresoe’er a hand divine
9089,SEVENTH BOOK.,Had warmed the place with ichor. Such I’ve found
9090,SEVENTH BOOK.,"At early morning, laid across my bed,"
9091,SEVENTH BOOK.,And woke up pelted with a childish laugh
9092,SEVENTH BOOK.,Which even Marian’s low precipitous ‘hush’
9093,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Had vainly interposed to put away,—"
9094,SEVENTH BOOK.,"While I, with shut eyes, smile and motion for"
9095,SEVENTH BOOK.,The dewy kiss that’s very sure to come
9096,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From mouth and cheeks, the whole child’s face at once"
9097,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Dissolved on mine,—as if a nosegay burst"
9098,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Its string with the weight of roses overblown,"
9099,SEVENTH BOOK.,And dropt upon me. Surely I should be glad.
9100,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The little creature almost loves me now,"
9101,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And calls my name ... ‘Alola,’ stripping off"
9102,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The _r_s like thorns, to make it smooth enough"
9103,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To take between his dainty, milk-fed lips,"
9104,SEVENTH BOOK.,"God love him! I should certainly be glad,"
9105,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Except, God help me, that I’m sorrowful,"
9106,SEVENTH BOOK.,Because of Romney.
9107,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Romney, Romney! Well,"
9108,SEVENTH BOOK.,This grows absurd!—too like a tune that runs
9109,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I’ the head, and forces all things in the world,"
9110,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Wind, rain, the creaking gnat or stuttering fly,"
9111,SEVENTH BOOK.,To sing itself and vex you;—yet perhaps
9112,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A paltry tune you never fairly liked,"
9113,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Some ‘I’d be a butterfly,’ or ‘C’est l’amour:’"
9114,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We’re made so,—not such tyrants to ourselves,"
9115,SEVENTH BOOK.,We are not slaves to nature. Some of us
9116,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Are turned, too, overmuch like some poor verse"
9117,SEVENTH BOOK.,With a trick of ritournelle: the same thing goes
9118,SEVENTH BOOK.,And comes back ever.
9119,SEVENTH BOOK.,Vincent Carrington
9120,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Is ‘sorry,’ and I’m sorry; but _he_’s strong"
9121,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To mount from sorrow to his heaven of love,"
9122,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And when he says at moments, ‘Poor, poor Leigh,"
9123,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Who’ll never call his own, so true a heart,"
9124,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So fair a face even,’—he must quickly lose"
9125,SEVENTH BOOK.,The pain of pity in the blush he has made
9126,SEVENTH BOOK.,"By his very pitying eyes. The snow, for him,"
9127,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Has fallen in May, and finds the whole earth warm,"
9128,SEVENTH BOOK.,And melts at the first touch of the green grass.
9129,SEVENTH BOOK.,
9130,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But Romney,—he has chosen, after all."
9131,SEVENTH BOOK.,I think he had as excellent a sun
9132,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To see by, as most others, and perhaps"
9133,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Has scarce seen really worse than some of us,"
9134,SEVENTH BOOK.,When all’s said. Let him pass. I’m not too much
9135,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A woman, not to be a man for once,"
9136,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And bury all my Dead like Alaric,"
9137,SEVENTH BOOK.,Depositing the treasures of my soul
9138,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In this drained water-course, and, letting flow"
9139,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The river of life again, with commerce-ships"
9140,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And pleasure-barges, full of silks and songs."
9141,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Blow, winds, and help us."
9142,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Ah, we mock ourselves"
9143,SEVENTH BOOK.,With talking of the winds! perhaps as much
9144,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With other resolutions. How it weighs,"
9145,SEVENTH BOOK.,"This hot, sick air! and how I covet here"
9146,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The Dead’s provision on the river’s couch,"
9147,SEVENTH BOOK.,With silver curtains drawn on tinkling rings!
9148,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or else their rest in quiet crypts,—laid by"
9149,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From heat and noise!—from those cicale, say,"
9150,SEVENTH BOOK.,And this more vexing heart-beat.
9151,SEVENTH BOOK.,So it is:
9152,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We covet for the soul, the body’s part,"
9153,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To die and rot. Even so, Aurora, ends"
9154,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Our aspiration, who bespoke our place"
9155,SEVENTH BOOK.,So far in the east. The occidental flats
9156,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Had fed us fatter, therefore? we have climbed"
9157,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Where herbage ends? we want the beast’s part now,"
9158,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And tire of the angel’s?—Men define a man,"
9159,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The creature who stands front-ward to the stars,"
9160,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The creature who looks inward to himself,"
9161,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The tool-wright, laughing creature. ’Tis enough:"
9162,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We’ll say instead, the inconsequent creature, man,—"
9163,SEVENTH BOOK.,For that’s his specialty. What creature else
9164,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Conceives the circle, and then walks the square?"
9165,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Loves things proved bad, and leaves a thing proved good?"
9166,SEVENTH BOOK.,"You think the bee makes honey half a year,"
9167,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To loathe the comb in winter, and desire"
9168,SEVENTH BOOK.,The little ant’s food rather? But a man—
9169,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Note men!—they are but women after all,"
9170,SEVENTH BOOK.,As women are but Auroras!—there are men
9171,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Born tender, apt to pale at a trodden worm,"
9172,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Who paint for pastime, in their favourite dream,"
9173,SEVENTH BOOK.,Spruce auto-vestments flowered with crocus-flames:
9174,SEVENTH BOOK.,"There are, too, who believe in hell, and lie:"
9175,SEVENTH BOOK.,"There are, who waste their souls in working out"
9176,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Life’s problem on these sands betwixt two tides,"
9177,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And end,—‘Now give us the beast’s part, in death.’"
9178,SEVENTH BOOK.,
9179,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Alas, long-suffering and most patient God,"
9180,SEVENTH BOOK.,Thou need’st be surelier God to bear with us
9181,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Than even to have made us! thou, aspire, aspire"
9182,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From henceforth for me! thou who hast, thyself,"
9183,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Endured this fleshhood, knowing how, as a soaked"
9184,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And sucking vesture, it would drag us down"
9185,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And choke us in the melancholy Deep,"
9186,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Sustain me, that, with thee, I walk these waves,"
9187,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Resisting!—breathe me upward, thou for me"
9188,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Aspiring, who art the way, the truth, the life,—"
9189,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That no truth henceforth seem indifferent,"
9190,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No way to truth laborious, and no life,"
9191,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Not even this life I live, intolerable!"
9192,SEVENTH BOOK.,The days went by. I took up the old days
9193,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With all their Tuscan pleasures, worn and spoiled,—"
9194,SEVENTH BOOK.,Like some lost book we dropt in the long grass
9195,SEVENTH BOOK.,On such a happy summer-afternoon
9196,SEVENTH BOOK.,"When last we read it with a loving friend,"
9197,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And find in autumn, when the friend is gone,"
9198,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The grass cut short, the weather changed, too late,"
9199,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And stare at, as at something wonderful"
9200,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For sorrow,—thinking how two hands, before,"
9201,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Had held up what is left to only one,"
9202,SEVENTH BOOK.,And how we smiled when such a vehement nail
9203,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Impressed the tiny dint here, which presents"
9204,SEVENTH BOOK.,This verse in fire for ever! Tenderly
9205,SEVENTH BOOK.,And mournfully I lived. I knew the birds
9206,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And insects,—which look fathered by the flowers"
9207,SEVENTH BOOK.,And emulous of their hues: I recognised
9208,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The moths, with that great overpoise of wings"
9209,SEVENTH BOOK.,Which makes a mystery of them how at all
9210,SEVENTH BOOK.,"They can stop flying: butterflies, that bear"
9211,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Upon their blue wings such red embers round,"
9212,SEVENTH BOOK.,They seem to scorch the blue air into holes
9213,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Each flight they take: and fire-flies, that suspire"
9214,SEVENTH BOOK.,In short soft lapses of transported flame
9215,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Across the tingling Dark, while overhead"
9216,SEVENTH BOOK.,The constant and inviolable stars
9217,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Outburn those lights-of-love: melodious owls,"
9218,SEVENTH BOOK.,"(If music had but one note and was sad,"
9219,SEVENTH BOOK.,’Twould sound just so) and all the silent swirl
9220,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of bats, that seem to follow in the air"
9221,SEVENTH BOOK.,Some grand circumference of a shadowy dome
9222,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To which we are blind: and then, the nightingales,"
9223,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which pluck our heart across a garden-wall,"
9224,SEVENTH BOOK.,(When walking in the town) and carry it
9225,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So high into the bowery almond-trees,"
9226,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We tremble and are afraid, and feel as if"
9227,SEVENTH BOOK.,The golden flood of moonlight unaware
9228,SEVENTH BOOK.,Dissolved the pillars of the steady earth
9229,SEVENTH BOOK.,And made it less substantial. And I knew
9230,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The harmless opal snakes, and large-mouthed frogs,"
9231,SEVENTH BOOK.,(Those noisy vaunters of their shallow streams)
9232,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And lizards, the green lightnings of the wall,"
9233,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which, if you sit down still, nor sigh too loud,"
9234,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Will flatter you and take you for a stone,"
9235,SEVENTH BOOK.,And flash familiarly about your feet
9236,SEVENTH BOOK.,With such prodigious eyes in such small heads!—
9237,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I knew them, though they had somewhat dwindled from"
9238,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My childish imagery,—and kept in mind"
9239,SEVENTH BOOK.,"How last I sate among them equally,"
9240,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In fellowship and mateship, as a child"
9241,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Will bear him still toward insect, beast, and bird,"
9242,SEVENTH BOOK.,Before the Adam in him has foregone
9243,SEVENTH BOOK.,"All privilege of Eden,—making friends"
9244,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And talk, with such a bird or such a goat,"
9245,SEVENTH BOOK.,And buying many a two-inch-wide rush-cage
9246,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To let out the caged cricket on a tree,"
9247,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Saying, ‘Oh, my dear grillino, were you cramped?"
9248,SEVENTH BOOK.,And are you happy with the ilex-leaves?
9249,SEVENTH BOOK.,And do you love me who have let you go?
9250,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Say _yes_ in singing, and I’ll understand.’"
9251,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But now the creatures all seemed farther off,"
9252,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No longer mine, nor like me; only _there_,"
9253,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A gulph between us. I could yearn indeed,"
9254,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Like other rich men, for a drop of dew"
9255,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To cool this heat,—a drop of the early dew,"
9256,SEVENTH BOOK.,The irrecoverable child-innocence
9257,SEVENTH BOOK.,(Before the heart took fire and withered life)
9258,SEVENTH BOOK.,When childhood might pair equally with birds;
9259,SEVENTH BOOK.,But now ... the birds were grown too proud for us!
9260,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Alas, the very sun forbids the dew."
9261,SEVENTH BOOK.,
9262,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And I, I had come back to an empty nest,"
9263,SEVENTH BOOK.,Which every bird’s too wise for. How I heard
9264,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My father’s step on that deserted ground,"
9265,SEVENTH BOOK.,"His voice along that silence, as he told"
9266,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The names of bird and insect, tree and flower,"
9267,SEVENTH BOOK.,And all the presentations of the stars
9268,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Across Valdarno, interposing still"
9269,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘My child,’ ‘my child.’ When fathers say ‘my child,’"
9270,SEVENTH BOOK.,"’Tis easier to conceive the universe,"
9271,SEVENTH BOOK.,And life’s transitions down the steps of law.
9272,SEVENTH BOOK.,
9273,SEVENTH BOOK.,I rode once to the little mountain-house
9274,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As fast as if to find my father there,"
9275,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But, when in sight of’t, within fifty yards,"
9276,SEVENTH BOOK.,I dropped my horse’s bridle on his neck
9277,SEVENTH BOOK.,And paused upon his flank. The house’s front
9278,SEVENTH BOOK.,Was cased with lingots of ripe Indian corn
9279,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In tesselated order, and device"
9280,SEVENTH BOOK.,Of golden patterns: not a stone of wall
9281,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Uncovered,—not an inch of room to grow"
9282,SEVENTH BOOK.,A vine-leaf. The old porch had disappeared;
9283,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And, in the open doorway, sate a girl"
9284,SEVENTH BOOK.,"At plaiting straws,—her black hair strained away"
9285,SEVENTH BOOK.,To a scarlet kerchief caught beneath her chin
9286,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In Tuscan fashion,—her full ebon eyes,"
9287,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which looked too heavy to be lifted so,"
9288,SEVENTH BOOK.,Still dropt and lifted toward the mulberry-tree
9289,SEVENTH BOOK.,On which the lads were busy with their staves
9290,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In shout and laughter, stripping all the boughs"
9291,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As bare as winter, of those summer leaves"
9292,SEVENTH BOOK.,My father had not changed for all the silk
9293,SEVENTH BOOK.,In which the ugly silkworms hide themselves.
9294,SEVENTH BOOK.,Enough. My horse recoiled before my heart—
9295,SEVENTH BOOK.,I turned the rein abruptly. Back we went
9296,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As fast, to Florence."
9297,SEVENTH BOOK.,That was trial enough
9298,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of graves. I would not visit, if I could,"
9299,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My father’s, or my mother’s any more,"
9300,SEVENTH BOOK.,To see if stone-cutter or lichen beat
9301,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So early in the race, or throw my flowers,"
9302,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Which could not out-smell heaven, or sweeten earth."
9303,SEVENTH BOOK.,"They live too far above, that I should look"
9304,SEVENTH BOOK.,So far below to find them: let me think
9305,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That rather they are visiting my grave,"
9306,SEVENTH BOOK.,"This life here, (undeveloped yet to life)"
9307,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And that they drop upon me, now and then,"
9308,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For token or for solace, some small weed"
9309,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Least odorous of the growths of paradise,"
9310,SEVENTH BOOK.,To spare such pungent scents as kill with joy.
9311,SEVENTH BOOK.,"My old Assunta, too, was dead, was dead—"
9312,SEVENTH BOOK.,"O land of all men’s past! for me alone,"
9313,SEVENTH BOOK.,"It would not mix its tenses. I was past,"
9314,SEVENTH BOOK.,"It seemed, like others,—only not in heaven."
9315,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And, many a Tuscan eve, I wandered down"
9316,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The cypress alley, like a restless ghost"
9317,SEVENTH BOOK.,That tries its feeble ineffectual breath
9318,SEVENTH BOOK.,Upon its own charred funeral-brands put out
9319,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Too soon,—where, black and stiff, stood up the trees"
9320,SEVENTH BOOK.,Against the broad vermilion of the skies.
9321,SEVENTH BOOK.,Such skies!—all clouds abolished in a sweep
9322,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of God’s skirt, with a dazzle to ghosts and men,"
9323,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As down I went, saluting on the bridge"
9324,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The hem of such, before ’twas caught away"
9325,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Beyond the peaks of Lucca. Underneath,"
9326,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The river, just escaping from the weight"
9327,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of that intolerable glory, ran"
9328,SEVENTH BOOK.,In acquiescent shadow murmurously:
9329,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And up, beside it, streamed the festa-folk"
9330,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With fellow-murmurs from their feet and fans,"
9331,SEVENTH BOOK.,(With _issimo_ and _ino_ and sweet poise
9332,SEVENTH BOOK.,Of vowels in their pleasant scandalous talk)
9333,SEVENTH BOOK.,Returning from the grand-duke’s dairy-farm
9334,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Before the trees grew dangerous at eight,"
9335,SEVENTH BOOK.,"(For, ‘trust no tree by moonlight,’ Tuscans say)"
9336,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To eat their ice at Doni’s tenderly,—"
9337,SEVENTH BOOK.,Each lovely lady close to a cavalier
9338,SEVENTH BOOK.,Who holds her dear fan while she feeds her smile
9339,SEVENTH BOOK.,"On meditative spoonfuls of vanille,"
9340,SEVENTH BOOK.,"He breathing hot protesting vows of love,"
9341,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Enough to thaw her cream, and scorch his beard."
9342,SEVENTH BOOK.,’Twas little matter. I could pass them by
9343,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Indifferently, not fearing to be known."
9344,SEVENTH BOOK.,"No danger of being wrecked upon a friend,"
9345,SEVENTH BOOK.,And forced to take an iceberg for an isle!
9346,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The very English, here, must wait to learn"
9347,SEVENTH BOOK.,To hang the cobweb of their gossip out
9348,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And catch a fly. I’m happy. It’s sublime,"
9349,SEVENTH BOOK.,This perfect solitude of foreign lands!
9350,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To be, as if you had not been till then,"
9351,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And were then, simply that you chose to be:"
9352,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To spring up, not be brought forth from the ground,"
9353,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Like grasshoppers at Athens, and skip thrice"
9354,SEVENTH BOOK.,Before a woman makes a pounce on you
9355,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And plants you in her hair!—possess, yourself,"
9356,SEVENTH BOOK.,"A new world all alive with creatures new,"
9357,SEVENTH BOOK.,"New sun, new moon, new flowers, new people—ah,"
9358,SEVENTH BOOK.,And be possessed by none of them! no right
9359,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In one, to call your name, enquire your where,"
9360,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or what you think of Mister Some-one’s book,"
9361,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or Mister Other’s marriage, or decease,"
9362,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or how’s the headache which you had last week,"
9363,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or why you look so pale still, since it’s gone?"
9364,SEVENTH BOOK.,—Such most surprising riddance of one’s life
9365,SEVENTH BOOK.,Comes next one’s death; it’s disembodiment
9366,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Without the pang. I marvel, people choose"
9367,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To stand stock-still like fakirs, till the moss"
9368,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Grows on them, and they cry out, self-admired,"
9369,SEVENTH BOOK.,"‘How verdant and how virtuous!’ Well, I’m glad:"
9370,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Or should be, if grown foreign to myself"
9371,SEVENTH BOOK.,As surely as to others.
9372,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Musing so,"
9373,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I walked the narrow unrecognising streets,"
9374,SEVENTH BOOK.,Where many a palace-front peers gloomily
9375,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Through stony vizors iron-barred, (prepared"
9376,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Alike, should foe or lover pass that way,"
9377,SEVENTH BOOK.,For guest or victim) and came wandering out
9378,SEVENTH BOOK.,Upon the churches with mild open doors
9379,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And plaintive wail of vespers, where a few,"
9380,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Those chiefly women, sprinkled round in blots"
9381,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Upon the dusky pavement, knelt and prayed"
9382,SEVENTH BOOK.,Toward the altar’s silver glory. Oft a ray
9383,SEVENTH BOOK.,"(I liked to sit and watch) would tremble out,"
9384,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Just touch some face more lifted, more in need,"
9385,SEVENTH BOOK.,Of course a woman’s—while I dreamed a tale
9386,SEVENTH BOOK.,To fit its fortunes. There was one who looked
9387,SEVENTH BOOK.,As if the earth had suddenly grown too large
9388,SEVENTH BOOK.,For such a little humpbacked thing as she;
9389,SEVENTH BOOK.,The pitiful black kerchief round her neck
9390,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Sole proof she had had a mother. One, again,"
9391,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Looked sick for love,—seemed praying some soft saint"
9392,SEVENTH BOOK.,To put more virtue in the new fine scarf
9393,SEVENTH BOOK.,"She spent a fortnight’s meals on, yesterday,"
9394,SEVENTH BOOK.,That cruel Gigi might return his eyes
9395,SEVENTH BOOK.,"From Giuliana. There was one, so old,"
9396,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So old, to kneel grew easier than to stand,—"
9397,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So solitary, she accepts at last"
9398,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Our Lady for her gossip, and frets on"
9399,SEVENTH BOOK.,Against the sinful world which goes its rounds
9400,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In marrying and being married, just the same"
9401,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As when ’twas almost good and had the right,"
9402,SEVENTH BOOK.,"(Her Gian alive, and she herself eighteen)."
9403,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And yet, now even, if Madonna willed,"
9404,SEVENTH BOOK.,"She’d win a tern in Thursday’s lottery,"
9405,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And better all things. Did she dream for nought,"
9406,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That, boiling cabbage for the fast-day’s soup,"
9407,SEVENTH BOOK.,It smelt like blessed entrails? such a dream
9408,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For nought? would sweetest Mary cheat her so,"
9409,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And lose that certain candle, straight and white"
9410,SEVENTH BOOK.,"As any fair grand-duchess in her teens,"
9411,SEVENTH BOOK.,Winch otherwise should flare here in a week?
9412,SEVENTH BOOK.,"_Benigna sis_, thou beauteous Queen of heaven!"
9413,SEVENTH BOOK.,
9414,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I sate there musing, and imagining"
9415,SEVENTH BOOK.,Such utterance from such faces: poor blind souls
9416,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That writhed toward heaven along the devil’s trail,—"
9417,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Who knows, I thought, but He may stretch his hand"
9418,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And pick them up? ’tis written in the Book,"
9419,SEVENTH BOOK.,He heareth the young ravens when they cry;
9420,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And yet they cry for carrion.—O my God,—"
9421,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And we, who make excuses for the rest,"
9422,SEVENTH BOOK.,"We do it in our measure. Then I knelt,"
9423,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And dropped my head upon the pavement too,"
9424,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And prayed, since I was foolish in desire"
9425,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Like other creatures, craving offal-food,"
9426,SEVENTH BOOK.,"That He would stop his ears to what I said,"
9427,SEVENTH BOOK.,And only listen to the run and beat
9428,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Of this poor, passionate, helpless blood—"
9429,SEVENTH BOOK.,And then
9430,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I lay, and spoke not. But He heard in heaven."
9431,SEVENTH BOOK.,So many Tuscan evenings passed the same!
9432,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I could not lose a sunset on the bridge,"
9433,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And would not miss a vigil in the church,"
9434,SEVENTH BOOK.,And liked to mingle with the out-door crowd
9435,SEVENTH BOOK.,"So strange and gay and ignorant of my face,"
9436,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For men you know not, are as good as trees."
9437,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And only once, at the Santissima,"
9438,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I almost chanced upon a man I knew,"
9439,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Sir Blaise Delorme. He saw me certainly,"
9440,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And somewhat hurried, as he crossed himself,"
9441,SEVENTH BOOK.,"The smoothness of the action,—then half bowed,"
9442,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But only half, and merely to my shade,"
9443,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I slipped so quick behind the porphyry plinth,"
9444,SEVENTH BOOK.,"And left him dubious if ’twas really I,"
9445,SEVENTH BOOK.,Or peradventure Satan’s usual trick
9446,SEVENTH BOOK.,To keep a mounting saint uncanonised.
9447,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But I was safe for that time, and he too;"
9448,SEVENTH BOOK.,The argent angels in the altar-flare
9449,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Absorbed his soul, next moment. The good man!"
9450,SEVENTH BOOK.,"In England we were scarce acquaintances,"
9451,SEVENTH BOOK.,That here in Florence he should keep my thought
9452,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Beyond the image on his eye, which came"
9453,SEVENTH BOOK.,And went: and yet his thought disturbed my life:
9454,SEVENTH BOOK.,"For, after that, I oftener sate at home"
9455,SEVENTH BOOK.,"On evenings, watching how they fined themselves"
9456,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With gradual conscience to a perfect night,"
9457,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Until the moon, diminished to a curve,"
9458,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Lay out there, like a sickle for His hand"
9459,SEVENTH BOOK.,Who cometh down at last to reap the earth.
9460,SEVENTH BOOK.,"At such times, ended seemed my trade of verse;"
9461,SEVENTH BOOK.,I feared to jingle bells upon my robe
9462,SEVENTH BOOK.,Before the four-faced silent cherubim:
9463,SEVENTH BOOK.,"With God so near me, could I sing of God?"
9464,SEVENTH BOOK.,"I did not write, nor read, nor even think,"
9465,SEVENTH BOOK.,"But sate absorbed amid the quickening glooms,"
9466,SEVENTH BOOK.,Most like some passive broken lump of salt
9467,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Dropt in by chance to a bowl of œnomel,"
9468,SEVENTH BOOK.,"To spoil the drink a little, and lose itself,"
9469,SEVENTH BOOK.,"Dissolving slowly, slowly, until lost."
9470,SEVENTH BOOK.,
9471,SEVENTH BOOK.,
9472,SEVENTH BOOK.,
9473,SEVENTH BOOK.,
9474,EIGHTH BOOK.,EIGHTH BOOK.
9475,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9476,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9477,EIGHTH BOOK.,"ONE eve it happened, when I sate alone,"
9478,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Alone, upon the terrace of my tower,"
9479,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A book upon my knees, to counterfeit"
9480,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The reading that I never read at all,"
9481,EIGHTH BOOK.,"While Marian, in the garden down below,"
9482,EIGHTH BOOK.,Knelt by the fountain (I could just hear thrill
9483,EIGHTH BOOK.,The drowsy silence of the exhausted day)
9484,EIGHTH BOOK.,And peeled a new fig from that purple heap
9485,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In the grass beside her,—turning out the red"
9486,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To feed her eager child, who sucked at it"
9487,EIGHTH BOOK.,With vehement lips across a gap of air
9488,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As he stood opposite, face and curls a-flame"
9489,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With that last sun-ray, crying, ‘give me, give,’"
9490,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And stamping with imperious baby-feet,"
9491,EIGHTH BOOK.,"(We’re all born princes)—something startled me,—"
9492,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The laugh of sad and innocent souls, that breaks"
9493,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Abruptly, as if frightened at itself;"
9494,EIGHTH BOOK.,’Twas Marian laughed. I saw her glance above
9495,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In sudden shame that I should hear her laugh,"
9496,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And straightway dropped my eyes upon my book,"
9497,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And knew, the first time, ’twas Boccaccio’s tales,"
9498,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The Falcon’s,—of the lover who for love"
9499,EIGHTH BOOK.,Destroyed the best that loved him. Some of us
9500,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Do it still, and then we sit and laugh no more."
9501,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Laugh _you_, sweet Marian! you’ve the right to laugh,"
9502,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Since God himself is for you, and a child!"
9503,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For me there’s somewhat less,—and so, I sigh."
9504,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9505,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The heavens were making room to hold the night,"
9506,EIGHTH BOOK.,The sevenfold heavens unfolding all their gates
9507,EIGHTH BOOK.,To let the stars out slowly (prophesied
9508,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In close-approaching advent, not discerned),"
9509,EIGHTH BOOK.,While still the cue-owls from the cypresses
9510,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of the Poggio called and counted every pulse
9511,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of the skyey palpitation. Gradually
9512,EIGHTH BOOK.,The purple and transparent shadows slow
9513,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Had filled up the whole valley to the brim,"
9514,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And flooded all the city, which you saw"
9515,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As some drowned city in some enchanted sea,"
9516,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Cut off from nature,—drawing you who gaze,"
9517,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With passionate desire, to leap and plunge,"
9518,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And find a sea-king with a voice of waves,"
9519,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And treacherous soft eyes, and slippery locks"
9520,EIGHTH BOOK.,You cannot kiss but you shall bring away
9521,EIGHTH BOOK.,Their salt upon your lips. The duomo-bell
9522,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Strikes ten, as if it struck ten fathoms down,"
9523,EIGHTH BOOK.,So deep; and fifty churches answer it
9524,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The same, with fifty various instances."
9525,EIGHTH BOOK.,Some gaslights tremble along squares and streets;
9526,EIGHTH BOOK.,The Pitti’s palace-front is drawn in fire;
9527,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And, past the quays, Maria Novella’s Place,"
9528,EIGHTH BOOK.,In which the mystic obelisks stand up
9529,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Triangular, pyramidal, each based"
9530,EIGHTH BOOK.,"On a single trine of brazen tortoises,"
9531,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To guard that fair church, Buonarroti’s Bride,"
9532,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That stares out from her large blind dial-eyes,"
9533,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Her quadrant and armillary dials, black"
9534,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With rhythms of many suns and moons, in vain"
9535,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Enquiry for so rich a soul as his,—"
9536,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Methinks I have plunged, I see it all so clear...."
9537,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And, oh my heart, ... the sea-king!"
9538,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9539,EIGHTH BOOK.,In my ears
9540,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The sound of waters. There he stood, my king!"
9541,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9542,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I felt him, rather than beheld him. Up"
9543,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I rose, as if he were my king indeed,"
9544,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And then sate down, in trouble at myself,"
9545,EIGHTH BOOK.,And struggling for my woman’s empery.
9546,EIGHTH BOOK.,’Tis pitiful; but women are so made:
9547,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We’ll die for you, perhaps,—’tis probable;"
9548,EIGHTH BOOK.,But we’ll not spare you an inch of our full height:
9549,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We’ll have our whole just stature,—five feet four,"
9550,EIGHTH BOOK.,Though laid out in our coffins: pitiful!
9551,EIGHTH BOOK.,"—‘You, Romney!—— Lady Waldemar is here?’"
9552,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9553,EIGHTH BOOK.,He answered in a voice which was not his.
9554,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘I have her letter; you shall read it soon:
9555,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But first, I must be heard a little, I,"
9556,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Who have waited long and travelled far for that,"
9557,EIGHTH BOOK.,Although you thought to have shut a tedious book
9558,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And farewell. Ah, you dog-eared such a page,"
9559,EIGHTH BOOK.,And here you find me.’
9560,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Did he touch my hand,"
9561,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Or but my sleeve? I trembled, hand and foot,—"
9562,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He must have touched me.—‘Will you sit?’ I asked,"
9563,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And motioned to a chair; but down he sate,"
9564,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A little slowly, as a man in doubt,"
9565,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Upon the couch beside me,—couch and chair"
9566,EIGHTH BOOK.,Being wheeled upon the terrace.
9567,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You are come,"
9568,EIGHTH BOOK.,My cousin Romney?—this is wonderful.
9569,EIGHTH BOOK.,But all is wonder on such summer-nights;
9570,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And nothing should surprise us any more,"
9571,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who see that miracle of stars. Behold.’
9572,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9573,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I signed above, where all the stars were out,"
9574,EIGHTH BOOK.,As if an urgent heat had started there
9575,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A secret writing from a sombre page,"
9576,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A blank last moment, crowded suddenly"
9577,EIGHTH BOOK.,With hurrying splendours.
9578,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Then you do not know’—
9579,EIGHTH BOOK.,He murmured.
9580,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Yes, I know,’ I said, ‘I know."
9581,EIGHTH BOOK.,I had the news from Vincent Carrington.
9582,EIGHTH BOOK.,And yet I did not think you’d leave the work
9583,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In England, for so much even,—though, of course,"
9584,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You’ll make a work-day of your holiday,"
9585,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And turn it to our Tuscan people’s use,—"
9586,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who much need helping since the Austrian boar
9587,EIGHTH BOOK.,(So bold to cross the Alp by Lombardy
9588,EIGHTH BOOK.,And dash his brute front unabashed against
9589,EIGHTH BOOK.,The steep snow-bosses of that shield of God
9590,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Who soon shall rise in wrath and shake it clear,)"
9591,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Came hither also,—raking up our vines"
9592,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And olive-gardens with his tyrannous tusks,"
9593,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And rolling on our maize with all his swine,’"
9594,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9595,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You had the news from Vincent Carrington,’"
9596,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He echoed,—picking up the phrase beyond,"
9597,EIGHTH BOOK.,As if he knew the rest was merely talk
9598,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To fill a gap and keep out a strong wind,—"
9599,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You had, then, Vincent’s personal news?’"
9600,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘His own,’"
9601,EIGHTH BOOK.,I answered. ‘All that ruined world of yours
9602,EIGHTH BOOK.,Seems crumbling into marriage. Carrington
9603,EIGHTH BOOK.,Has chosen wisely.’
9604,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Do _you_ take it so?’
9605,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He cried, ‘and is it possible at last’ ..."
9606,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He paused there,—and then, inward to himself,"
9607,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Too much at last, too late!—yet certainly’ ..."
9608,EIGHTH BOOK.,(And there his voice swayed as an Alpine plank
9609,EIGHTH BOOK.,That feels a passionate torrent underneath)
9610,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘The knowledge, if I had known it, first or last,"
9611,EIGHTH BOOK.,Had never changed the actual case for _me_.
9612,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And best, for _her_, at this time.’"
9613,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nay, I thought,"
9614,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He loves Kate Ward, it seems, now, like a man,"
9615,EIGHTH BOOK.,Because he has married Lady Waldemar.
9616,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Ah, Vincent’s letter said how Leigh was moved"
9617,EIGHTH BOOK.,To hear that Vincent was betrothed to Kate.
9618,EIGHTH BOOK.,With what cracked pitchers go we to deep wells
9619,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In this world! Then I spoke,—‘I did not think,"
9620,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My cousin, you had ever known Kate Ward.’"
9621,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9622,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘In fact I never knew her. ’Tis enough
9623,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That Vincent did, before he chose his wife"
9624,EIGHTH BOOK.,For other reasons than those topaz eyes
9625,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’ve heard of. Not to undervalue them,"
9626,EIGHTH BOOK.,For all that. One takes up the world with eyes.’
9627,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9628,EIGHTH BOOK.,"—Including Romney Leigh, I thought again,"
9629,EIGHTH BOOK.,Albeit he knows them only by repute.
9630,EIGHTH BOOK.,"How vile must all men be, since _he’s_ a man."
9631,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9632,EIGHTH BOOK.,"His deep pathetic voice, as if he guessed"
9633,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I did not surely love him, took the word;"
9634,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘You never got a letter from Lord Howe
9635,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A month back, dear Aurora?’"
9636,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9637,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘None,’ I said."
9638,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9639,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘I felt it was so,’ he replied: ‘Yet, strange!"
9640,EIGHTH BOOK.,Sir Blaise Delorme has passed through Florence?’
9641,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Ay,"
9642,EIGHTH BOOK.,"By chance I saw him in Our Lady’s church,"
9643,EIGHTH BOOK.,"(I saw him, mark you, but he saw not me)"
9644,EIGHTH BOOK.,Clean-washed in holy water from the count
9645,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of things terrestrial,—letters and the rest;"
9646,EIGHTH BOOK.,He had crossed us out together with his sins.
9647,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Ay, strange; but only strange that good Lord Howe"
9648,EIGHTH BOOK.,Preferred him to the post because of pauls.
9649,EIGHTH BOOK.,For me I’m sworn to never trust a man—
9650,EIGHTH BOOK.,At least with letters.’
9651,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9652,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘There were facts to tell,—"
9653,EIGHTH BOOK.,To smooth with eye and accent. Howe supposed ...
9654,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Well, well, no matter! there was dubious need;"
9655,EIGHTH BOOK.,You heard the news from Vincent Carrington.
9656,EIGHTH BOOK.,And yet perhaps you had been startled less
9657,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To see me, dear Aurora, if you had read"
9658,EIGHTH BOOK.,That letter.’
9659,EIGHTH BOOK.,—Now he sets me down as vexed.
9660,EIGHTH BOOK.,I think I’ve draped myself in woman’s pride
9661,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To a perfect purpose. Oh, I’m vexed, it seems!"
9662,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My friend Lord Howe deputes his friend Sir Blaise,"
9663,EIGHTH BOOK.,To break as softly as a sparrow’s egg
9664,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That lets a bird out tenderly, the news"
9665,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of Romney’s marriage to a certain saint;
9666,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To _smooth with eye and accent_,—indicate"
9667,EIGHTH BOOK.,His possible presence. Excellently well
9668,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You’ve played your part, my Lady Waldemar,—"
9669,EIGHTH BOOK.,As I’ve played mine.
9670,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Dear Romney,’ I began,"
9671,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You did not use, of old, to be so like"
9672,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A Greek king coming from a taken Troy,"
9673,EIGHTH BOOK.,’Twas needful that precursors spread your path
9674,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With three-piled carpets, to receive your foot"
9675,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And dull the sound of’t. For myself, be sure,"
9676,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Although it frankly ground the gravel here,"
9677,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I still could bear it. Yet I’m sorry, too,"
9678,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To lose this famous letter, which Sir Blaise"
9679,EIGHTH BOOK.,Has twisted to a lighter absently
9680,EIGHTH BOOK.,To fire some holy taper with: Lord Howe
9681,EIGHTH BOOK.,Writes letters good for all things but to lose;
9682,EIGHTH BOOK.,And many a flower of London gossipry
9683,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Has dropt wherever such a stem broke off,—"
9684,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of course I know that, lonely among my vines,"
9685,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Where nothing’s talked of, save the blight again,"
9686,EIGHTH BOOK.,And no more Chianti! Still the letter’s use
9687,EIGHTH BOOK.,As preparation ... Did I start indeed?
9688,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Last night I started at a cockchafer,"
9689,EIGHTH BOOK.,And shook a half-hour after. Have you learnt
9690,EIGHTH BOOK.,"No more of women, ’spite of privilege,"
9691,EIGHTH BOOK.,Than still to take account too seriously
9692,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of such weak flutterings? Why, we like it, sir,—"
9693,EIGHTH BOOK.,We get our powers and our effects that way.
9694,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The trees stand stiff and still at time of frost,"
9695,EIGHTH BOOK.,"If no wind tears them; but, let summer come,"
9696,EIGHTH BOOK.,"When trees are happy,—and a breath avails"
9697,EIGHTH BOOK.,To set them trembling through a million leaves
9698,EIGHTH BOOK.,In luxury of emotion. Something less
9699,EIGHTH BOOK.,It takes to move a woman: let her start
9700,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And shake at pleasure,—nor conclude at yours,"
9701,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The winter’s bitter,—but the summer’s green.’"
9702,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9703,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He answered, ‘Be the summer ever green"
9704,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With you, Aurora!—though you sweep your sex"
9705,EIGHTH BOOK.,With somewhat bitter gusts from where you live
9706,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Above them,—whirling downward from your heights"
9707,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Your very own pine-cones, in a grand disdain"
9708,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of the lowland burrs with which you scatter them.
9709,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So high and cold to others and yourself,"
9710,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A little less to Romney, were unjust,"
9711,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And thus, I would not have you. Let it pass:"
9712,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I feel content, so. You can bear indeed"
9713,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My sudden step beside you: but for me,"
9714,EIGHTH BOOK.,"’Twould move me sore to hear your softened voice,—"
9715,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Aurora’s voice,—if softened unaware"
9716,EIGHTH BOOK.,In pity of what I am.’
9717,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Ah friend, I thought,"
9718,EIGHTH BOOK.,As husband of the Lady Waldemar
9719,EIGHTH BOOK.,You’re granted very sorely pitiable!
9720,EIGHTH BOOK.,And yet Aurora Leigh must guard her voice
9721,EIGHTH BOOK.,"From softening in the pity of your case,"
9722,EIGHTH BOOK.,As if from lie or licence. Certainly
9723,EIGHTH BOOK.,We’ll soak up all the slush and soil of life
9724,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With softened voices, ere we come to _you_."
9725,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9726,EIGHTH BOOK.,At which I interrupted my own thought
9727,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And spoke out calmly. ‘Let us ponder, friend,"
9728,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Whate’er our state, we must have made it first;"
9729,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And though the thing displease us, ay, perhaps"
9730,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Displease us warrantably, never doubt"
9731,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That other states, thought possible once, and then"
9732,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Rejected by the instinct of our lives,—"
9733,EIGHTH BOOK.,"If then adopted, had displeased us more"
9734,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Than this, in which the choice, the will, the love,"
9735,EIGHTH BOOK.,Has stamped the honour of a patent act
9736,EIGHTH BOOK.,"From henceforth. What we choose, may not be good;"
9737,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But, that we choose it, proves it good for _us_"
9738,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Potentially, fantastically, now"
9739,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Or last year, rather than a thing we saw,"
9740,EIGHTH BOOK.,And saw no need for choosing. Moths will burn
9741,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Their wings,—which proves that light is good for moths,"
9742,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Or else they had flown not, where they agonise,’"
9743,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9744,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Ay, light is good,’ he echoed, and there paused."
9745,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And then abruptly, ... ‘Marian. Marian’s well?’"
9746,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9747,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I bowed my head, but found no word. ’Twas hard"
9748,EIGHTH BOOK.,To speak of _her_ to Lady Waldemar’s
9749,EIGHTH BOOK.,"New husband. How much did he know, at last?"
9750,EIGHTH BOOK.,"How much? how little?—— He would take no sign,"
9751,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But straight repeated,—‘Marian. Is she well?’"
9752,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9753,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘She’s well,’ I answered."
9754,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9755,EIGHTH BOOK.,She was there in sight
9756,EIGHTH BOOK.,"An hour back, but the night had drawn her home;"
9757,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Where still I heard her in an upper room,"
9758,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Her low voice singing to the child in bed,"
9759,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who restless with the summer-heat and play
9760,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And slumber snatched at noon, was long sometimes"
9761,EIGHTH BOOK.,"At falling off, and took a score of songs"
9762,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And mother-hushes, ere she saw him sound."
9763,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9764,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘She’s well,’ I answered."
9765,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9766,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Here?’ he asked.
9767,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Yes, here.’"
9768,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9769,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He stopped and sighed. ‘That shall be presently,"
9770,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But now this must be. I have words to say,"
9771,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And would be alone to say them, I with you,"
9772,EIGHTH BOOK.,And no third troubling.’
9773,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9774,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Speak then,’ I returned,"
9775,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘She will not vex you.’
9776,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9777,EIGHTH BOOK.,"At which, suddenly"
9778,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He turned his face upon me with its smile,"
9779,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As if to crush me. ‘I have read your book,"
9780,EIGHTH BOOK.,Aurora.’
9781,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You have read it,’ I replied,"
9782,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘And I have writ it,—we have done with it."
9783,EIGHTH BOOK.,And now the rest?’
9784,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘The rest is like the first,’"
9785,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He answered,—‘for the book is in my heart,"
9786,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Lives in me, wakes in me, and dreams in me:"
9787,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My daily bread tastes of it,—and my wine"
9788,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Which has no smack of it, I pour it out;"
9789,EIGHTH BOOK.,It seems unnatural drinking.’
9790,EIGHTH BOOK.,Bitterly
9791,EIGHTH BOOK.,I took the word up; ‘Never waste your wine.
9792,EIGHTH BOOK.,The book lived in me ere it lived in you;
9793,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I know it closer than another does,"
9794,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And that it’s foolish, feeble, and afraid,"
9795,EIGHTH BOOK.,And all unworthy so much compliment.
9796,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Beseech you, keep your wine,—and, when you drink,"
9797,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Still wish some happier fortune to your friend,"
9798,EIGHTH BOOK.,Than even to have written a far better book.’
9799,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9800,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He answered gently, ‘That is consequent:"
9801,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The poet looks beyond the book he has made,"
9802,EIGHTH BOOK.,Or else he had not made it. If a man
9803,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Could make a man, he’d henceforth be a god"
9804,EIGHTH BOOK.,In feeling what a little thing is man:
9805,EIGHTH BOOK.,"It is not my case. And this special book,"
9806,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I did not make it, to make light of it:"
9807,EIGHTH BOOK.,"It stands above my knowledge, draws me up;"
9808,EIGHTH BOOK.,’Tis high to me. It may be that the book
9809,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Is not so high, but I so low, instead;"
9810,EIGHTH BOOK.,Still high to me. I mean no compliment:
9811,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I will not say there are not, young or old,"
9812,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Male writers, ay, or female,—let it pass,"
9813,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who’ll write us richer and completer books.
9814,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A man may love a woman perfectly,"
9815,EIGHTH BOOK.,And yet by no means ignorantly maintain
9816,EIGHTH BOOK.,A thousand women have not larger eyes:
9817,EIGHTH BOOK.,Enough that she alone has looked at him
9818,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With eyes that, large or small, have won his soul."
9819,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And so, this book, Aurora,—so, your book.’"
9820,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9821,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Alas,’ I answered, ‘is it so, indeed?’"
9822,EIGHTH BOOK.,And then was silent.
9823,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9824,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Is it so, indeed,’"
9825,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He echoed, ‘that _alas_ is all your word?’"
9826,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I said,—‘I’m thinking of a far-off June,"
9827,EIGHTH BOOK.,"When you and I, upon my birthday once,"
9828,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Discoursed of life and art, with both untried."
9829,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’m thinking, Romney, how ’twas morning then,"
9830,EIGHTH BOOK.,And now ’tis night.’
9831,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9832,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘And now,’ he said, ‘’tis night.’"
9833,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9834,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘I’m thinking,’ I resumed, ‘’tis somewhat sad"
9835,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That if I had known, that morning in the dew,"
9836,EIGHTH BOOK.,My cousin Romney would have said such words
9837,EIGHTH BOOK.,"On such a night, at close of many years,"
9838,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In speaking of a future book of mine,"
9839,EIGHTH BOOK.,"It would have pleased me better as a hope,"
9840,EIGHTH BOOK.,Than as an actual grace it can at all.
9841,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That’s sad, I’m thinking.’"
9842,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Ay,’ he said, ‘’tis night.’"
9843,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9844,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘And there,’ I added lightly, ‘are the stars!"
9845,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And here, we’ll talk of stars, and not of books.’"
9846,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9847,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You have the stars,’ he murmured,—‘it is well:"
9848,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Be like them! shine, Aurora, on my dark,"
9849,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Though high and cold and only like a star,"
9850,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And for this short night only,—you, who keep"
9851,EIGHTH BOOK.,The same Aurora of the bright June day
9852,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That withered up the flowers before my face,"
9853,EIGHTH BOOK.,And turned me from the garden evermore
9854,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Because I was not worthy. Oh, deserved,"
9855,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Deserved! That I, who verily had not learnt"
9856,EIGHTH BOOK.,"God’s lesson half, attaining as a dunce"
9857,EIGHTH BOOK.,To obliterate good words with fractious thumbs
9858,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And cheat myself of the context,—_I_ should push"
9859,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Aside, with male ferocious impudence,"
9860,EIGHTH BOOK.,The world’s Aurora who had conned her part
9861,EIGHTH BOOK.,"On the other side the leaf! ignore her so,"
9862,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Because she was a woman and a queen,"
9863,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And had no beard to bristle through her song,—"
9864,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My teacher, who has taught me with a book,"
9865,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My Miriam, whose sweet mouth, when nearly drowned"
9866,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I still heard singing on the shore! Deserved,"
9867,EIGHTH BOOK.,That here I should look up unto the stars
9868,EIGHTH BOOK.,And miss the glory’ ...
9869,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Can I understand?’
9870,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I broke in. ‘You speak wildly, Romney Leigh,"
9871,EIGHTH BOOK.,Or I hear wildly. In that morning-time
9872,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We recollect, the roses were too red,"
9873,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The trees too green, reproach too natural"
9874,EIGHTH BOOK.,If one should see not what the other saw:
9875,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And now, it’s night, remember; we have shades"
9876,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In place of colours; we are now grown cold,"
9877,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And old, my cousin Romney. Pardon me,—"
9878,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’m very happy that you like my book,"
9879,EIGHTH BOOK.,And very sorry that I quoted back
9880,EIGHTH BOOK.,A ten years’ birthday; ’twas so mad a thing
9881,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In any woman, I scarce marvel much"
9882,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You took it for a venturous piece of spite,"
9883,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Provoking such excuses, as indeed"
9884,EIGHTH BOOK.,I cannot call you slack in.’
9885,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Understand,’"
9886,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He answered sadly, ‘something, if but so."
9887,EIGHTH BOOK.,"This night is softer than an English day,"
9888,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And men may well come hither when they’re sick,"
9889,EIGHTH BOOK.,To draw in easier breath from larger air.
9890,EIGHTH BOOK.,"’Tis thus with me; I’ve come to you,—to you,"
9891,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My Italy of women, just to breathe"
9892,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My soul out once before you, ere I go,"
9893,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As humble as God makes me at the last,"
9894,EIGHTH BOOK.,"(I thank Him) quite out of the way of men,"
9895,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And yours, Aurora,—like a punished child,"
9896,EIGHTH BOOK.,"His cheeks all blurred with tears and naughtiness,"
9897,EIGHTH BOOK.,To silence in a corner. I am come
9898,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To speak, beloved’...."
9899,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Wisely, cousin Leigh,"
9900,EIGHTH BOOK.,And worthily of us both!’
9901,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Yes, worthily;"
9902,EIGHTH BOOK.,For this time I must speak out and confess
9903,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That I, so truculent in assumption once,"
9904,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So absolute in dogma, proud in aim,"
9905,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And fierce in expectation,—I, who felt"
9906,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The whole world tugging at my skirts for help,"
9907,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As if no other man than I, could pull,"
9908,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nor woman, but I led her by the hand,"
9909,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nor cloth hold, but I had it in my coat,—"
9910,EIGHTH BOOK.,Do know myself to-night for what I was
9911,EIGHTH BOOK.,"On that June-day, Aurora. Poor bright day,"
9912,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Which meant the best ... a woman and a rose, ..."
9913,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And which I smote upon the cheek with words,"
9914,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Until it turned and rent me! Young you were,"
9915,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That birthday, poet, but you talked the right:"
9916,EIGHTH BOOK.,"While I, ... I built up follies like a wall"
9917,EIGHTH BOOK.,To intercept the sunshine and your face.
9918,EIGHTH BOOK.,Your face! that’s worse.’
9919,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Speak wisely, cousin Leigh.’"
9920,EIGHTH BOOK.,
9921,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Yes, wisely, dear Aurora, though too late:"
9922,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But then, not wisely. I was heavy then,"
9923,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And stupid, and distracted with the cries"
9924,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of tortured prisoners in the polished brass
9925,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of that Phalarian bull, society,—"
9926,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Which seems to bellow bravely like ten bulls,"
9927,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But, if you listen, moans and cries instead"
9928,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Despairingly, like victims tossed and gored"
9929,EIGHTH BOOK.,And trampled by their hoofs. I heard the cries
9930,EIGHTH BOOK.,Too close: I could not hear the angels lift
9931,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A fold of rustling air, nor what they said"
9932,EIGHTH BOOK.,To help my pity. I beheld the world
9933,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As one great famishing carnivorous mouth,—"
9934,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A huge, deserted, callow, black, bird Thing,"
9935,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With piteous open beak that hurt my heart,"
9936,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Till down upon the filthy ground I dropped,"
9937,EIGHTH BOOK.,And tore the violets up to get the worms.
9938,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Worms, worms, was all my cry: an open mouth,"
9939,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A gross want, bread to fill it to the lips,"
9940,EIGHTH BOOK.,No more! That poor men narrowed their demands
9941,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To such an end, was virtue, I supposed,"
9942,EIGHTH BOOK.,Adjudicating that to see it so
9943,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Was reason. Oh, I did not push the case"
9944,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Up higher, and ponder how it answers, when"
9945,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The rich take up the same cry for themselves,"
9946,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Professing equally,—‘an open mouth"
9947,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A gross want, food to fill us, and no more!’"
9948,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Why that’s so far from virtue, only vice"
9949,EIGHTH BOOK.,Finds reason for it! That makes libertines:
9950,EIGHTH BOOK.,That slurs our cruel streets from end to end
9951,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With eighty thousand women in one smile,"
9952,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who only smile at night beneath the gas:
9953,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The body’s satisfaction and no more,"
9954,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Being used for argument against the soul’s,"
9955,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Here too! the want, here too, implying the right."
9956,EIGHTH BOOK.,"—How dark I stood that morning in the sun,"
9957,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My best Aurora, though I saw your eyes,—"
9958,EIGHTH BOOK.,"When first you told me ... oh, I recollect"
9959,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The words ... and how you lifted your white hand,"
9960,EIGHTH BOOK.,And how your white dress and your burnished curls
9961,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Went greatening round you in the still blue air,"
9962,EIGHTH BOOK.,As if an inspiration from within
9963,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Had blown them all out when you spoke the same,"
9964,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Even these,—‘You will not compass your poor ends"
9965,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of barley-feeding and material ease,"
9966,EIGHTH BOOK.,Without the poet’s individualism
9967,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To work your universal. It takes a soul,"
9968,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To move a body,—it takes a high-souled man,"
9969,EIGHTH BOOK.,To move the masses ... even to a cleaner stye:
9970,EIGHTH BOOK.,"It takes the ideal, to blow an inch inside"
9971,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The dust of the actual: and your Fouriers failed,"
9972,EIGHTH BOOK.,Because not poets enough to understand
9973,EIGHTH BOOK.,That life develops from within.’ I say
9974,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Your words,—I could say other words of yours;"
9975,EIGHTH BOOK.,For none of all your words has been more lost
9976,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Than sweet verbena, which, being brushed against,"
9977,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Will hold you three hours after by the smell,"
9978,EIGHTH BOOK.,In spite of long walks on the windy hills.
9979,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But these words dealt in sharper perfume,—these"
9980,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Were ever on me, stinging through my dreams,"
9981,EIGHTH BOOK.,And saying themselves for ever o’er my acts
9982,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Like some unhappy verdict. That I failed,"
9983,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Is certain. Stye or no stye, to contrive"
9984,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The swine’s propulsion toward the precipice,"
9985,EIGHTH BOOK.,Proved easy and plain. I subtly organised
9986,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And ordered, built the cards up high and higher,"
9987,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Till, some one breathing, all fell flat again;"
9988,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In setting right society’s wide wrong,"
9989,EIGHTH BOOK.,Mere life’s so fatal! So I failed indeed
9990,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Once, twice, and oftener,—hearing through the rents"
9991,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of obstinate purpose, still those words of yours,"
9992,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘_You will not compass your poor ends, not you!_’"
9993,EIGHTH BOOK.,But harder than you said them; every time
9994,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Still farther from your voice, until they came"
9995,EIGHTH BOOK.,To overcrow me with triumphant scorn
9996,EIGHTH BOOK.,Which vexed me to resistance. Set down this
9997,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For condemnation,—I was guilty here:"
9998,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I stood upon my deed and fought my doubt,"
9999,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As men will,—for I doubted,—till at last"
10000,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My deed gave way beneath me suddenly,"
10001,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And left me what I am. The curtain dropped,"
10002,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My part quite ended, all the footlights quenched,"
10003,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My own soul hissing at me through the dark,"
10004,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I, ready for confession,—I was wrong,"
10005,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’ve sorely failed; I’ve slipped the ends of life,"
10006,EIGHTH BOOK.,I yield; you have conquered.’
10007,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Stay,’ I answered him;"
10008,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘I’ve something for your hearing, also. I"
10009,EIGHTH BOOK.,Have failed too.’
10010,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You!’ he said, ‘you’re very great;"
10011,EIGHTH BOOK.,The sadness of your greatness fits you well:
10012,EIGHTH BOOK.,As if the plume upon a hero’s casque
10013,EIGHTH BOOK.,Should nod a shadow upon his victor face.’
10014,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10015,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I took him up austerely,—‘You have read"
10016,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My book, but not my heart; for recollect,"
10017,EIGHTH BOOK.,"’Tis writ in Sanscrit, which you bungle at."
10018,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’ve surely failed, I know; if failure means"
10019,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To look back sadly on work gladly done,—"
10020,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To wander on my mountains of Delight,"
10021,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So called, (I can remember a friend’s words"
10022,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As well as you, sir,) weary and in want"
10023,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of even a sheep-path, thinking bitterly...."
10024,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Well, well! no matter. I but say so much,"
10025,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To keep you, Romney Leigh, from saying more,"
10026,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And let you feel I am not so high indeed,"
10027,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That I can bear to have you at my foot,—"
10028,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Or safe, that I can help you. That June-day,"
10029,EIGHTH BOOK.,Too deeply sunk in craterous sunsets now
10030,EIGHTH BOOK.,For you or me to dig it up alive;
10031,EIGHTH BOOK.,To pluck it out all bleeding with spent flame
10032,EIGHTH BOOK.,"At the roots, before those moralising stars"
10033,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We have got instead,—that poor lost day, you said"
10034,EIGHTH BOOK.,Some words as truthful as the thing of mine
10035,EIGHTH BOOK.,You care to keep in memory: and I hold
10036,EIGHTH BOOK.,"If I, that day, and, being the girl I was,"
10037,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Had shown a gentler spirit, less arrogance,"
10038,EIGHTH BOOK.,"It had not hurt me. Ah, you’ll not mistake"
10039,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The point here. I but only think, you see,"
10040,EIGHTH BOOK.,"More justly, that’s more humbly, of myself,"
10041,EIGHTH BOOK.,Than when I tried a crown on and supposed....
10042,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nay, laugh, sir,—I’ll laugh with you!—pray you, laugh."
10043,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’ve had so many birthdays since that day,"
10044,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’ve learnt to prize mirth’s opportunities,"
10045,EIGHTH BOOK.,Which come too seldom. Was it you who said
10046,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I was not changed? the same Aurora? Ah,"
10047,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We could laugh there, too! Why, Ulysses’ dog"
10048,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Knew _him_, and wagged his tail and died: but if"
10049,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I had owned a dog, I too, before my Troy,"
10050,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And, if you brought him here, ... I warrant you"
10051,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He’d look into my face, bark lustily,"
10052,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And live on stoutly, as the creatures will"
10053,EIGHTH BOOK.,Whose spirits are not troubled by long loves.
10054,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A dog would never know me, I’m so changed;"
10055,EIGHTH BOOK.,Much less a friend ... except that you’re misled
10056,EIGHTH BOOK.,"By the colour of the hair, the trick of the voice,"
10057,EIGHTH BOOK.,Like that Aurora Leigh’s.’
10058,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Sweet trick of voice!
10059,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I would be a dog for this, to know it at last,"
10060,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And die upon the falls of it. O love,"
10061,EIGHTH BOOK.,"O best Aurora! are you then so sad,"
10062,EIGHTH BOOK.,You scarcely had been sadder as my wife?’
10063,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10064,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Your wife, sir! I must certainly be changed,"
10065,EIGHTH BOOK.,"If I, Aurora, can have said a thing"
10066,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So light, it catches at the knightly spurs"
10067,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of a noble gentleman like Romney Leigh,"
10068,EIGHTH BOOK.,And trips him from his honourable sense
10069,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of what befits’ ...
10070,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You wholly misconceive,’"
10071,EIGHTH BOOK.,He answered.
10072,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I returned,—‘I’m glad of it;"
10073,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But keep from misconception, too, yourself:"
10074,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I am not humbled to so low a point,"
10075,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nor so far saddened. If I am sad at all,"
10076,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Ten layers of birthdays on a woman’s head,"
10077,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Are apt to fossilise her girlish mirth,"
10078,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Though ne’er so merry: I’m perforce more wise,"
10079,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And that, in truth, means sadder. For the rest,"
10080,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Look here, sir: I was right upon the whole,"
10081,EIGHTH BOOK.,That birthday morning. ’Tis impossible
10082,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To get at men excepting through their souls,"
10083,EIGHTH BOOK.,However open their carnivorous jaws;
10084,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And poets get directlier at the soul,"
10085,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Than any of your œconomists:—for which,"
10086,EIGHTH BOOK.,You must not overlook the poet’s work
10087,EIGHTH BOOK.,When scheming for the world’s necessities.
10088,EIGHTH BOOK.,The soul’s the way. Not even Christ Himself
10089,EIGHTH BOOK.,Can save man else than as He holds man’s soul;
10090,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And therefore did He come into our flesh,"
10091,EIGHTH BOOK.,As some wise hunter creeping on his knees
10092,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With a torch, into the blackness of some cave,"
10093,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To face and quell the beast there,—take the soul,"
10094,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And so possess the whole man, body and soul."
10095,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I said, so far, right, yes; not farther, though:"
10096,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We both were wrong that June-day,—both as wrong"
10097,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As an east wind had been. I who talked of art,"
10098,EIGHTH BOOK.,And you who grieved for all men’s griefs ... what then?
10099,EIGHTH BOOK.,We surely made too small a part for God
10100,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In these things. What we are, imports us more"
10101,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Than what we eat; and life, you’ve granted me,"
10102,EIGHTH BOOK.,Develops from within. But innermost
10103,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of the inmost, most interior of the interne,"
10104,EIGHTH BOOK.,"God claims his own, Divine humanity"
10105,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Renewing nature,—or the piercingest verse,"
10106,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Prest in by subtlest poet, still must keep"
10107,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As much upon the outside of a man,"
10108,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As the very bowl, in which he dips his beard."
10109,EIGHTH BOOK.,"—And then, ... the rest. I cannot surely speak."
10110,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Perhaps I doubt more than you doubted then,"
10111,EIGHTH BOOK.,"If I, the poet’s veritable charge,"
10112,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Have borne upon my forehead. If I have,"
10113,EIGHTH BOOK.,"It might feel somewhat liker to a crown,"
10114,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The foolish green one even.—Ah, I think,"
10115,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And chiefly when the sun shines, that I’ve failed."
10116,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But what then, Romney? Though we fail indeed,"
10117,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You ... I ... a score of such weak workers, ... He"
10118,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Fails never. If He cannot work by us,"
10119,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He will work over us. Does He want a man,"
10120,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Much less a woman, think you? Every time"
10121,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The star winks there, so many souls are born,"
10122,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who all shall work too. Let our own be calm:
10123,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We should be ashamed to sit beneath those stars,"
10124,EIGHTH BOOK.,Impatient that we’re nothing.’
10125,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Could we sit
10126,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Just so for ever, sweetest friend,’ he said,"
10127,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘My failure would seem better than success.
10128,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And yet, indeed, your book has dealt with me"
10129,EIGHTH BOOK.,"More gently, cousin, than you ever will!"
10130,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The book brought down entire the bright June-day,"
10131,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And set me wandering in the garden-walks,"
10132,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And let me watch the garland in a place,"
10133,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You blushed so ... nay, forgive me; do not stir:"
10134,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I only thank the book for what it taught,"
10135,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And what, permitted. Poet, doubt yourself;"
10136,EIGHTH BOOK.,But never doubt that you’re a poet to me
10137,EIGHTH BOOK.,"From henceforth. Ah, you’ve written poems, sweet,"
10138,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Which moved me in secret, as the sap is moved"
10139,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In still March-branches, signless as a stone:"
10140,EIGHTH BOOK.,But this last book o’ercame me like soft rain
10141,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Which falls at midnight, when the tightened bark"
10142,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Breaks out into unhesitating buds,"
10143,EIGHTH BOOK.,And sudden protestations of the spring.
10144,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In all your other books, I saw but _you_:"
10145,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A man may see the moon so, in a pond,"
10146,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And not be nearer therefore to the moon,"
10147,EIGHTH BOOK.,Nor use the sight ... except to drown himself:
10148,EIGHTH BOOK.,And so I forced my heart back from the sight;
10149,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For what had _I_, I thought, to do with _her_,—"
10150,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Aurora ... Romney? But, in this last book,"
10151,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You showed me something separate from yourself,"
10152,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Beyond you; and I bore to take it in,"
10153,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And let it draw me. You have shown me truths,"
10154,EIGHTH BOOK.,"O June-day friend, that help me now at night,"
10155,EIGHTH BOOK.,"When June is over! truths not yours, indeed,"
10156,EIGHTH BOOK.,But set within my reach by means of you:
10157,EIGHTH BOOK.,Presented by your voice and verse the way
10158,EIGHTH BOOK.,To take them clearest. Verily I was wrong;
10159,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And verily, many thinkers of this age,"
10160,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Ay, many Christian teachers, half in heaven,"
10161,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Are wrong in just my sense, who understood"
10162,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Our natural world too insularly, as if"
10163,EIGHTH BOOK.,No spiritual counterpart completed it
10164,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Consummating its meaning, rounding all"
10165,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To justice and perfection, line by line,"
10166,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Form by form, nothing single, nor alone,—"
10167,EIGHTH BOOK.,The great below clenched by the great above;
10168,EIGHTH BOOK.,Shade here authenticating substance there;
10169,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The body proving spirit, as the effect"
10170,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The cause: we, meantime, being too grossly apt"
10171,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To hold the natural, as dogs a bone,"
10172,EIGHTH BOOK.,(Though reason and nature beat us in the face);
10173,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So obstinately, that we’ll break our teeth"
10174,EIGHTH BOOK.,Or ever we let go. For everywhere
10175,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We’re too materialistic,—eating clay,"
10176,EIGHTH BOOK.,(Like men of the west) instead of Adam’s corn
10177,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And Noah’s wine; clay by handfuls, clay by lumps,"
10178,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Until we’re filled up to the throat with clay,"
10179,EIGHTH BOOK.,And grow the grimy colour of the ground
10180,EIGHTH BOOK.,"On which we are feeding. Ay, materialist"
10181,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The age’s name is. God himself, with some,"
10182,EIGHTH BOOK.,Is apprehended as the bare result
10183,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of what his hand materially has made,"
10184,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Expressed in such an algebraic sign,"
10185,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Called God;—that is, to put it otherwise,"
10186,EIGHTH BOOK.,They add up nature to a naught of God
10187,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And cross the quotient. There are many, even,"
10188,EIGHTH BOOK.,Whose names are written in the Christian church
10189,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To no dishonour,—diet still on mud,"
10190,EIGHTH BOOK.,And splash the altars with it. You might think
10191,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The clay, Christ laid upon their eyelids when,"
10192,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Still blind, he called them to the use of sight,"
10193,EIGHTH BOOK.,Remained there to retard its exercise
10194,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With clogging incrustations. Close to heaven,"
10195,EIGHTH BOOK.,"They see, for mysteries, through the open doors,"
10196,EIGHTH BOOK.,Vague puffs of smoke from pots of earthenware;
10197,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And fain would enter, when their time shall come,"
10198,EIGHTH BOOK.,With quite a different body than St. Paul
10199,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Has promised,—husk and chaff, the whole barley-corn,"
10200,EIGHTH BOOK.,Or where’s the resurrection?’
10201,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Thus it is,’"
10202,EIGHTH BOOK.,I sighed. And he resumed with mournful face.
10203,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Beginning so, and filling up with clay"
10204,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The wards of this great key, the natural world,"
10205,EIGHTH BOOK.,And fumbling vainly therefore at the lock
10206,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of the spiritual,—we feel ourselves shut in"
10207,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With all the wild-beast roar of struggling life,"
10208,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The terrors and compunctions of our souls,"
10209,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As saints with lions,—we who are not saints,"
10210,EIGHTH BOOK.,And have no heavenly lordship in our stare
10211,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To awe them backward! Ay, we are forced, so pent,"
10212,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To judge the whole too partially, ... confound"
10213,EIGHTH BOOK.,Conclusions. Is there any common phrase
10214,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Significant, when the adverb’s heard alone,"
10215,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The verb being absent, and the pronoun out?"
10216,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But we, distracted in the roar of life,"
10217,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Still insolently at God’s adverb snatch,"
10218,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And bruit against Him that his thought is void,"
10219,EIGHTH BOOK.,"His meaning hopeless;—cry, that everywhere"
10220,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The government is slipping from his hand,"
10221,EIGHTH BOOK.,Unless some other Christ ... say Romney Leigh ...
10222,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Come up, and toil and moil, and change the world,"
10223,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For which the First has proved inadequate,"
10224,EIGHTH BOOK.,However we talk bigly of His work
10225,EIGHTH BOOK.,And piously of His person. We blaspheme
10226,EIGHTH BOOK.,"At last, to finish that doxology,"
10227,EIGHTH BOOK.,Despairing on the earth for which He died.’
10228,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10229,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘So now,’ I asked, ‘you have more hope of men?’"
10230,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10231,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘I hope,’ he answered: ‘I am come to think"
10232,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That God will have his work done, as you said,"
10233,EIGHTH BOOK.,And that we need not be disturbed too much
10234,EIGHTH BOOK.,For Romney Leigh or others having failed
10235,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With this or that quack nostrum,—recipes"
10236,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For keeping summits by annulling depths,"
10237,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For learning wrestling with long lounging sleeves,"
10238,EIGHTH BOOK.,And perfect heroism without a scratch.
10239,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We fail,—what, then? Aurora, if I smiled"
10240,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To see you, in your lovely morning-pride,"
10241,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Try on the poet’s wreath which suits the noon,—"
10242,EIGHTH BOOK.,"(Sweet cousin, walls must get the weather-stain"

10244,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I stood myself there worthier of contempt,"
10245,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Self-rated, in disastrous arrogance,"
10246,EIGHTH BOOK.,As competent to sorrow for mankind
10247,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And even their odds. A man may well despair,"
10248,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who counts himself so needful to success.
10249,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I failed. I throw the remedy back on God,"
10250,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And sit down here beside you, in good hope.’"
10251,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10252,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘And yet, take heed,’ I answered, ‘lest we lean"
10253,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Too dangerously on the other side,"
10254,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And so fail twice. Be sure, no earnest work"
10255,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of any honest creature, howbeit weak,"
10256,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Imperfect, ill-adapted, fails so much,"
10257,EIGHTH BOOK.,It is not gathered as a grain of sand
10258,EIGHTH BOOK.,To enlarge the sum of human action used
10259,EIGHTH BOOK.,For carrying out God’s end. No creature works
10260,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So ill, observe, that therefore he’s cashiered."
10261,EIGHTH BOOK.,The honest earnest man must stand and work;
10262,EIGHTH BOOK.,The woman also; otherwise she drops
10263,EIGHTH BOOK.,"At once below the dignity of man,"
10264,EIGHTH BOOK.,Accepting serfdom. Free men freely work:

10267,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He cried, ‘True. After Adam, work was curse;"

10271,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The Six-day Worker, working still in us,"
10272,EIGHTH BOOK.,Has called us freely to work on with Him
10273,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In high companionship. So, happiest!"
10274,EIGHTH BOOK.,I count that Heaven itself is only work
10275,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To a surer issue. Let us work, indeed,—"
10276,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But, no more, work as Adam ... nor as Leigh"
10277,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Erewhile, as if the only man on earth,"
10278,EIGHTH BOOK.,Responsible for all the thistles blown

10286,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Who makes the head, content to miss the point,—"
10287,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Who makes the point, agreed to leave the join:"
10288,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And if a man should cry, ‘I want a pin,"
10289,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And I must make it straightway, head and point,’—"
10290,EIGHTH BOOK.,His wisdom is not worth the pin he wants.
10291,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Seven men to a pin,—and not a man too much!"
10292,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Seven generations, haply, to this world,"
10293,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To right it visibly, a finger’s breadth,"
10294,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And mend its rents a little. Oh, to storm"
10295,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And say,—‘This world here is intolerable;"
10296,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I will not eat this corn, nor drink this wine,"
10297,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nor love this woman, flinging her my soul"

10301,EIGHTH BOOK.,"(Since virtue kindles at the touch of joy,"

10317,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Ay, hard to God, but not to Romney Leigh!"
10318,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For Romney has a pattern on his nail,"
10319,EIGHTH BOOK.,(Whatever may be lacking on the Mount)

10464,EIGHTH BOOK.,To weep a little (for he’s getting old)
10465,EIGHTH BOOK.,That such perdition should o’ertake a man
10466,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of such fair acres,—in the parish, too!"
10467,EIGHTH BOOK.,He printed his discourses ‘by request;’
10468,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And if your book shall sell as his did, then"
10469,EIGHTH BOOK.,Your verses are less good than I suppose.
10470,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The women of the neighbourhood subscribed,"
10471,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And sent me a copy bound in scarlet silk,"
10472,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Tooled edges, blazoned with the arms of Leigh:"
10473,EIGHTH BOOK.,I own that touched me.’
10474,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘What, the pretty ones?"
10475,EIGHTH BOOK.,Poor Romney!’
10476,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Otherwise the effect was small.
10477,EIGHTH BOOK.,I had my windows broken once or twice
10478,EIGHTH BOOK.,"By liberal peasants, naturally incensed"
10479,EIGHTH BOOK.,"At such a vexer of Arcadian peace,"
10480,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who would not let men call their wives their own
10481,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To kick like Britons,—and made obstacles"
10482,EIGHTH BOOK.,"When things went smoothly as a baby drugged,"
10483,EIGHTH BOOK.,Toward freedom and starvation; bringing down
10484,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The wicked London tavern-thieves and drabs,"
10485,EIGHTH BOOK.,To affront the blessed hillside drabs and thieves
10486,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With mended morals, quotha,—fine new lives!—"
10487,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My windows paid for’t. I was shot at, once,"
10488,EIGHTH BOOK.,By an active poacher who had hit a hare
10489,EIGHTH BOOK.,"From the other barrel, tired of springeing game"
10490,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So long upon my acres, undisturbed,"
10491,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And restless for the country’s virtue, (yet"
10492,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He missed me)—ay, and pelted very oft"
10493,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In riding through the village. ‘There he goes,"
10494,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Who’d drive away our Christian gentlefolks,"
10495,EIGHTH BOOK.,To catch us undefended in the trap
10496,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He baits with poisonous cheese, and lock us up"
10497,EIGHTH BOOK.,In that pernicious prison of Leigh Hall
10498,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With all his murderers! Give another name,"
10499,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And say Leigh Hell, and burn it up with fire.’"
10500,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And so they did, at last, Aurora.’"
10501,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Did?’
10502,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10503,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You never heard it, cousin? Vincent’s news"
10504,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Came stinted, then.’"
10505,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘They did? they burnt Leigh Hall?’
10506,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10507,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You’re sorry, dear Aurora? Yes indeed,"
10508,EIGHTH BOOK.,"They did it perfectly: a thorough work,"
10509,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And not a failure, this time. Let us grant"
10510,EIGHTH BOOK.,"’Tis somewhat easier, though, to burn a house"
10511,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Than build a system:—yet that’s easy, too,"
10512,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In a dream. Books, pictures,—ay, the pictures! what,"
10513,EIGHTH BOOK.,You think your dear Vandykes would give them pause?
10514,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Our proud ancestral Leighs with those peaked beards,"
10515,EIGHTH BOOK.,Or bosoms white as foam thrown up on rocks
10516,EIGHTH BOOK.,From the old-spent wave. Such calm defiant looks
10517,EIGHTH BOOK.,"They flared up with! now, nevermore they’ll twit"
10518,EIGHTH BOOK.,The bones in the family-vault with ugly death.
10519,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Not one was rescued, save the Lady Maud,"
10520,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Who threw you down, that morning you were born,"
10521,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The undeniable lineal mouth and chin,"
10522,EIGHTH BOOK.,To wear for ever for her gracious sake;
10523,EIGHTH BOOK.,For which good deed I saved her: the rest went:
10524,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And you, you’re sorry, cousin. Well, for me,"
10525,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With all my phalansterians safely out,"
10526,EIGHTH BOOK.,"(Poor hearts, they helped the burners, it was said,"
10527,EIGHTH BOOK.,And certainly a few clapped hands and yelled)
10528,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The ruin did not hurt me as it might,—"
10529,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As when for instance I was hurt one day,"
10530,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A certain letter being destroyed. In fact,"
10531,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To see the great house flare so ... oaken floors,"
10532,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Our fathers made so fine with rushes once,"
10533,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Before our mothers furbished them with trains,—"
10534,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Carved wainscoats, panelled walls, the favourite slide"
10535,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For draining off a martyr, (or a rogue)"
10536,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The echoing galleries, half a half-mile long,"
10537,EIGHTH BOOK.,And all the various stairs that took you up
10538,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And took you down, and took you round about"
10539,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Upon their slippery darkness, recollect,"
10540,EIGHTH BOOK.,All helping to keep up one blazing jest;
10541,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The flames through all the casements pushing forth,"
10542,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Like red-hot devils crinkled into snakes,"
10543,EIGHTH BOOK.,"All signifying,—‘Look you, Romney Leigh,"
10544,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We save the people from your saving, here,"
10545,EIGHTH BOOK.,Yet so as by fire! we make a pretty show
10546,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Besides,—and that’s the best you’ve ever done.’—"
10547,EIGHTH BOOK.,"—To see this, almost moved myself to clap!"
10548,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The ‘vale et plaude’ came, too, with effect,"
10549,EIGHTH BOOK.,"When, in the roof fell, and the fire, that paused,"
10550,EIGHTH BOOK.,Stunned momently beneath the stroke of slates
10551,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And tumbling rafters, rose at once and roared,"
10552,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And wrapping the whole house, (which disappeared"
10553,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In a mounting whirlwind of dilated flame,)"
10554,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Blew upward, straight, its drift of fiery chaff"
10555,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In the face of Heaven, ... which blenched, and ran up higher.’"
10556,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10557,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Poor Romney!’
10558,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Sometimes when I dream,’ he said,"
10559,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘I hear the silence after; ’twas so still.
10560,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For all those wild beasts, yelling, cursing round,"
10561,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Were suddenly silent, while you counted five!"
10562,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So silent, that you heard a young bird fall"
10563,EIGHTH BOOK.,From the top-nest in the neighbouring rookery
10564,EIGHTH BOOK.,Through edging over-rashly toward the light.
10565,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The old rooks had already fled too far,"
10566,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To hear the screech they fled with, though you saw"
10567,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Some flying on still, like scatterings of dead leaves"
10568,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In autumn-gusts, seen dark against the sky:"
10569,EIGHTH BOOK.,"All flying,—ousted, like the House of Leigh.’"
10570,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10571,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Dear Romney!’
10572,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Evidently ’twould have been
10573,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A fine sight for a poet, sweet, like you,"
10574,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To make the verse blaze after. I myself,"
10575,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Even I, felt something in the grand old trees,"
10576,EIGHTH BOOK.,Which stood that moment like brute Druid gods
10577,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Amazed upon the rim of ruin, where,"
10578,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As into a blackened socket, the great fire"
10579,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Had dropped,—still throwing up splinters now and then,"
10580,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To show them grey with all their centuries,"
10581,EIGHTH BOOK.,Left there to witness that on such a day
10582,EIGHTH BOOK.,The house went out.’
10583,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Ah!’
10584,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘While you counted five
10585,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I seemed to feel a little like a Leigh,—"
10586,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But then it passed, Aurora. A child cried;"
10587,EIGHTH BOOK.,And I had enough to think of what to do
10588,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With all those houseless wretches in the dark,"
10589,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And ponder where they’d dance the next time, they"
10590,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who had burnt the viol.’
10591,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Did you think of that?
10592,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Who burns his viol will not dance, I know,"
10593,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To cymbals, Romney.’"
10594,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘O my sweet sad voice,’"
10595,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He cried,—‘O voice that speaks and overcomes!"
10596,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The sun is silent, but Aurora speaks.’"
10597,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10598,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Alas,’ I said; ‘I speak I know not what:"
10599,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’m back in childhood, thinking as a child,"
10600,EIGHTH BOOK.,A foolish fancy—will it make you smile?
10601,EIGHTH BOOK.,I shall not from the window of my room
10602,EIGHTH BOOK.,Catch sight of those old chimneys any more.’
10603,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10604,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘No more,’ he answered. ‘If you pushed one day"
10605,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Through all the green hills to our fathers’ house,"
10606,EIGHTH BOOK.,You’d come upon a great charred circle where
10607,EIGHTH BOOK.,The patient earth was singed an acre round;
10608,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With one stone-stair, symbolic of my life,"
10609,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Ascending, winding, leading up to nought!"
10610,EIGHTH BOOK.,’Tis worth a poet’s seeing. Will you go?’
10611,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10612,EIGHTH BOOK.,I made no answer. Had I any right
10613,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To weep with this man, that I dared to speak?"
10614,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A woman stood between his soul and mine,"
10615,EIGHTH BOOK.,And waved us off from touching evermore
10616,EIGHTH BOOK.,With those unclean white hands of hers. Enough.
10617,EIGHTH BOOK.,We had burnt our viols and were silent.
10618,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So,"
10619,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The silence lengthened till it pressed. I spoke,"
10620,EIGHTH BOOK.,To breathe: ‘I think you were ill afterward.’
10621,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10622,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘More ill,’ he answered, ‘had been scarcely ill."
10623,EIGHTH BOOK.,I hoped this feeble fumbling at life’s knot
10624,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Might end concisely,—but I failed to die,"
10625,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As formerly I failed to live,—and thus"
10626,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Grew willing, having tried all other ways,"
10627,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To try just God’s. Humility’s so good,"
10628,EIGHTH BOOK.,"When pride’s impossible. Mark us, how we make"
10629,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Our virtues, cousin, from our worn-out sins,"
10630,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Which smack of them from henceforth. Is it right,"
10631,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For instance, to wed here, while you love there?"
10632,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And yet because a man sins once, the sin"
10633,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Cleaves to him, in necessity to sin;"
10634,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That if he sin not _so_, to damn himself,"
10635,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He sins _so_, to damn others with himself:"
10636,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And thus, to wed here, loving there, becomes"
10637,EIGHTH BOOK.,A duty. Virtue buds a dubious leaf
10638,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Round mortal brows; your ivy’s better, dear."
10639,EIGHTH BOOK.,"—Yet she, ’tis certain, is my very wife;"
10640,EIGHTH BOOK.,The very lamb left mangled by the wolves
10641,EIGHTH BOOK.,Through my own bad shepherding: and could I choose
10642,EIGHTH BOOK.,But take her on my shoulder past this stretch
10643,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of rough, uneasy wilderness, poor lamb,"
10644,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Poor child, poor child?—Aurora, my belov’d,"
10645,EIGHTH BOOK.,I will not vex you any more to-night;
10646,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But, having spoken what I came to say,"
10647,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The rest shall please you. What she can, in me,—"
10648,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Protection, tender liking, freedom, ease,"
10649,EIGHTH BOOK.,"She shall have surely, liberally, for her"
10650,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And hers, Aurora. Small amends they’ll make"
10651,EIGHTH BOOK.,For hideous evils (which she had not known
10652,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Except by me) and for this imminent loss,"
10653,EIGHTH BOOK.,"This forfeit presence of a gracious friend,"
10654,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Which also she must forfeit for my sake,"
10655,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Since, ... drop your hand in mine a moment, sweet,"
10656,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We’re parting!—— Ah, my snowdrop, what a touch,"
10657,EIGHTH BOOK.,As if the wind had swept it off! you grudge
10658,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Your gelid sweetness on my palm but so,"
10659,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A moment? angry, that I could not bear"
10660,EIGHTH BOOK.,"_You_ ... speaking, breathing, living, side by side"
10661,EIGHTH BOOK.,"With some one called my wife ... and live, myself?"
10662,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nay, be not cruel—you must understand!"
10663,EIGHTH BOOK.,Your lightest footfall on a floor of mine
10664,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Would shake the house, my lintel being uncrossed"
10665,EIGHTH BOOK.,"’Gainst angels: henceforth it is night with me,"
10666,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And so, henceforth, I put the shutters up;"
10667,EIGHTH BOOK.,Auroras must not come to spoil my dark.’
10668,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10669,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He smiled so feebly, with an empty hand"
10670,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Stretched sideway from me,—as indeed he looked"
10671,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To any one but me to give him help,—"
10672,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And, while the moon came suddenly out full,"
10673,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The double-rose of our Italian moons,"
10674,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Sufficient, plainly, for the heaven and earth,"
10675,EIGHTH BOOK.,"(The stars, struck dumb and washed away in dews"
10676,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of golden glory, and the mountains steeped"
10677,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In divine languor) he, the man, appeared"
10678,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So pale and patient, like the marble man"
10679,EIGHTH BOOK.,A sculptor puts his personal sadness in
10680,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To join his grandeur of ideal thought,—"
10681,EIGHTH BOOK.,As if his mallet struck me from my height
10682,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of passionate indignation, I who had risen"
10683,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Pale,—doubting, paused, ... Was Romney mad indeed?"
10684,EIGHTH BOOK.,Had all this wrong of heart made sick the brain?
10685,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10686,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Then quiet, with a sort of tremulous pride,"
10687,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘Go, cousin,’ I said coldly. ‘A farewell"
10688,EIGHTH BOOK.,Was sooner spoken ’twixt a pair of friends
10689,EIGHTH BOOK.,"In those old days, than seems to suit you now:"
10690,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And if, since then, I’ve writ a book or two,"
10691,EIGHTH BOOK.,I’m somewhat dull still in the manly art
10692,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of phrase and metaphrase. Why, any man"
10693,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Can carve a score of white Loves out of snow,"
10694,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As Buonarroti down in Florence there,"
10695,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And set them on the wall in some safe shade,"
10696,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As safe, sir, as your marriage! very good;"
10697,EIGHTH BOOK.,Though if a woman took one from the ledge
10698,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To put it on the table by her flowers,"
10699,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And let it mind her of a certain friend,"
10700,EIGHTH BOOK.,"’Twould drop at once, (so better,) would not bear"
10701,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Her nail-mark even, where she took it up"
10702,EIGHTH BOOK.,"A little tenderly; so best, I say:"
10703,EIGHTH BOOK.,"For me, I would not touch so light a thing,"
10704,EIGHTH BOOK.,And risk to spoil it half an hour before
10705,EIGHTH BOOK.,The sun shall shine to melt it: leave it there.
10706,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’m plain at speech, direct in purpose: when"
10707,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I speak, you’ll take the meaning as it is,"
10708,EIGHTH BOOK.,And not allow for puckerings in the silks
10709,EIGHTH BOOK.,"By clever stitches. I’m a woman, sir,"
10710,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And use the woman’s figures naturally,"
10711,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As you, the male license. So, I wish you well."
10712,EIGHTH BOOK.,I’m simply sorry for the griefs you’ve had—
10713,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And not for your sake only, but mankind’s."
10714,EIGHTH BOOK.,"This race is never grateful: from the first,"
10715,EIGHTH BOOK.,"One fills their cup at supper with pure wine,"
10716,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Which back they give at cross-time on a sponge,"
10717,EIGHTH BOOK.,In bitter vinegar.’
10718,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘If gratefuller,’"
10719,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He murmured,—‘by so much less pitiable!"
10720,EIGHTH BOOK.,"God’s self would never have come down to die,"
10721,EIGHTH BOOK.,Could man have thanked him for it.’
10722,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Happily
10723,EIGHTH BOOK.,"’Tis patent that, whatever,’ I resumed,"
10724,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘You suffered from this thanklessness of men,"
10725,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You sink no more than Moses’ bulrush-boat,"
10726,EIGHTH BOOK.,"When once relieved of Moses; for you’re light,"
10727,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You’re light, my cousin! which is well for you,"
10728,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And manly. For myself,—now mark me, sir,"
10729,EIGHTH BOOK.,"They burnt Leigh Hall; but if, consummated"
10730,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To devils, heightened beyond Lucifers,"
10731,EIGHTH BOOK.,"They had burnt instead a star or two, of those"
10732,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We saw above there just a moment back,"
10733,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Before the moon abolished them,—destroyed"
10734,EIGHTH BOOK.,And riddled them in ashes through a sieve
10735,EIGHTH BOOK.,"On the head of the foundering universe,—what then?"
10736,EIGHTH BOOK.,"If you and I remained still you and I,"
10737,EIGHTH BOOK.,"It would not shift our places as mere friends,"
10738,EIGHTH BOOK.,Nor render decent you should toss a phrase
10739,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Beyond the point of actual feeling!—nay,"
10740,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You shall not interrupt me: as you said,"
10741,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We’re parting. Certainly, not once or twice,"
10742,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To-night you’ve mocked me somewhat, or yourself;"
10743,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And I, at least, have not deserved it so"
10744,EIGHTH BOOK.,"That I should meet it unsurprised. But now,"
10745,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Enough: we’re parting ... parting. Cousin Leigh,"
10746,EIGHTH BOOK.,I wish you well through all the acts of life
10747,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And life’s relations, wedlock, not the least;"
10748,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And it shall ‘please me,’ in your words, to know"
10749,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You yield your wife, protection, freedom, ease,"
10750,EIGHTH BOOK.,And very tender liking. May you live
10751,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So happy with her, Romney, that your friends"
10752,EIGHTH BOOK.,"May praise her for it. Meantime, some of us"
10753,EIGHTH BOOK.,Are wholly dull in keeping ignorant
10754,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of what she has suffered by you, and what debt"
10755,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of sorrow your rich love sits down to pay:
10756,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But if ’tis sweet for love to pay its debt,"
10757,EIGHTH BOOK.,’Tis sweeter still for love to give its gift;
10758,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And you, be liberal in the sweeter way,—"
10759,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You can, I think. At least, as touches me,"
10760,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You owe her, cousin Romney, no amends;"
10761,EIGHTH BOOK.,"She is not used to hold my gown so fast,"
10762,EIGHTH BOOK.,You need entreat her now to let it go:
10763,EIGHTH BOOK.,"The lady never was a friend of mine,"
10764,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nor capable,—I thought you knew as much,—"
10765,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of losing for your sake so poor a prize
10766,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As such a worthless friendship. Be content,"
10767,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Good cousin, therefore, both for her and you!"
10768,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I’ll never spoil your dark, nor dull your noon,"
10769,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nor vex you when you’re merry, nor when you rest:"
10770,EIGHTH BOOK.,You shall not need to put a shutter up
10771,EIGHTH BOOK.,"To keep out this Aurora. Ah, your north"
10772,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Can make Auroras which vex nobody,"
10773,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Scarce known from evenings! also, let me say,"
10774,EIGHTH BOOK.,My larks fly higher than some windows. Right;
10775,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You’ve read your Leighs. Indeed ’twould shake a house,"
10776,EIGHTH BOOK.,"If such as I came in with outstretched hand,"
10777,EIGHTH BOOK.,Still warm and thrilling from the clasp of one ...
10778,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Of one we know, ... to acknowledge, palm to palm,"
10779,EIGHTH BOOK.,As mistress there ... the Lady Waldemar.’
10780,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10781,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Now God be with us’ ... with a sudden clash
10782,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of voice he interrupted—‘what name’s that?
10783,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You spoke a name, Aurora.’"
10784,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Pardon me;
10785,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I would that, Romney, I could name your wife"
10786,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nor wound you, yet be worthy.’"
10787,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Are we mad?’
10788,EIGHTH BOOK.,He echoed—‘wife! mine! Lady Waldemar!
10789,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I think you said my wife.’ He sprang to his feet,"
10790,EIGHTH BOOK.,And threw his noble head back toward the moon
10791,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As one who swims against a stormy sea,"
10792,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And laughed with such a helpless, hopeless scorn,"
10793,EIGHTH BOOK.,I stood and trembled.
10794,EIGHTH BOOK.,"‘May God judge me so,’"
10795,EIGHTH BOOK.,"He said at last,—‘I came convicted here,"
10796,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And humbled sorely if not enough. I came,"
10797,EIGHTH BOOK.,Because this woman from her crystal soul
10798,EIGHTH BOOK.,Had shown me something which a man calls light:
10799,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Because too, formerly, I sinned by her"
10800,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As, then and ever since, I have, by God,"
10801,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Through arrogance of nature,—though I loved ..."
10802,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Whom best, I need not say, ... since that is writ"
10803,EIGHTH BOOK.,Too plainly in the book of my misdeeds;
10804,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And thus I came here to abase myself,"
10805,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And fasten, kneeling, on her regent brows"
10806,EIGHTH BOOK.,A garland which I startled thence one day
10807,EIGHTH BOOK.,Of her beautiful June-youth. But here again
10808,EIGHTH BOOK.,I’m baffled!—fail in my abasement as
10809,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My aggrandisement: there’s no room left for me,"
10810,EIGHTH BOOK.,"At any woman’s foot, who misconceives"
10811,EIGHTH BOOK.,"My nature, purpose, possible actions. What!"
10812,EIGHTH BOOK.,Are you the Aurora who made large my dreams
10813,EIGHTH BOOK.,To frame your greatness? you conceive so small?
10814,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You stand so less than woman, through being more,"
10815,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And lose your natural instinct, like a beast,"
10816,EIGHTH BOOK.,Through intellectual culture? since indeed
10817,EIGHTH BOOK.,I do not think that any common she
10818,EIGHTH BOOK.,Would dare adopt such fancy-forgeries
10819,EIGHTH BOOK.,For the legible life-signature of such
10820,EIGHTH BOOK.,"As I, with all my blots: with all my blots!"
10821,EIGHTH BOOK.,"At last then, peerless cousin, we are peers—"
10822,EIGHTH BOOK.,"At last we’re even. Ah, you’ve left your height;"
10823,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And here upon my level we take hands,"
10824,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And here I reach you to forgive you, sweet,"
10825,EIGHTH BOOK.,"And that’s a fall, Aurora. Long ago"
10826,EIGHTH BOOK.,"You seldom understood me,—but, before,"
10827,EIGHTH BOOK.,"I could not blame you. Then, you only seemed"
10828,EIGHTH BOOK.,"So high above, you could not see below;"
10829,EIGHTH BOOK.,"But now I breathe,—but now I pardon!—nay,"
10830,EIGHTH BOOK.,"We’re parting. Dearest, men have burnt my house,"
10831,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Maligned my motives,—but not one, I swear,"
10832,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Has wronged my soul as this Aurora has,"
10833,EIGHTH BOOK.,Who called the Lady Waldemar my wife.’
10834,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10835,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Not married to her! yet you said’ ...
10836,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘Again?
10837,EIGHTH BOOK.,"Nay, read the lines’ (he held a letter out)"
10838,EIGHTH BOOK.,‘She sent you through me.’
10839,EIGHTH BOOK.,"By the moonlight there,"
10840,EIGHTH BOOK.,I tore the meaning out with passionate haste
10841,EIGHTH BOOK.,Much rather than I read it. Thus it ran.
10842,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10843,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10844,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10845,EIGHTH BOOK.,
10846,NINTH BOOK.,NINTH BOOK.
10847,NINTH BOOK.,
10848,NINTH BOOK.,
10849,NINTH BOOK.,"EVEN thus. I pause to write it out at length,"
10850,NINTH BOOK.,The letter of the Lady Waldemar.—
10851,NINTH BOOK.,
10852,NINTH BOOK.,"‘I prayed your cousin Leigh to take you this,"
10853,NINTH BOOK.,"He says he’ll do it. After years of love,"
10854,NINTH BOOK.,"Or what is called so,—when a woman frets"
10855,NINTH BOOK.,"And fools upon one string of a man’s name,"
10856,NINTH BOOK.,"And fingers it for ever till it breaks,—"
10857,NINTH BOOK.,"He may perhaps do for her such a thing,"
10858,NINTH BOOK.,And she accept it without detriment
10859,NINTH BOOK.,Although she should not love him any more.
10860,NINTH BOOK.,"And I, who do not love him, nor love you,"
10861,NINTH BOOK.,"Nor you, Aurora,—choose you shall repent"
10862,NINTH BOOK.,"Your most ungracious letter, and confess,"
10863,NINTH BOOK.,"Constrained by his convictions, (he’s convinced)"
10864,NINTH BOOK.,"You’ve wronged me foully. Are you made so ill,"
10865,NINTH BOOK.,You woman—to impute such ill to _me_?
10866,NINTH BOOK.,"We both had mothers,—lay in their bosom once."
10867,NINTH BOOK.,"Why, after all, I thank you, Aurora Leigh,"
10868,NINTH BOOK.,For proving to myself that there are things
10869,NINTH BOOK.,"I would not do, ... not for my life ... nor him ..."
10870,NINTH BOOK.,"Though something I have somewhat overdone,—"
10871,NINTH BOOK.,"For instance, when I went to see the gods"
10872,NINTH BOOK.,"One morning on Olympus, with a step"
10873,NINTH BOOK.,"That shook the thunder in a certain cloud,"
10874,NINTH BOOK.,"Committing myself vilely. Could I think,"
10875,NINTH BOOK.,The Muse I pulled my heart out from my breast
10876,NINTH BOOK.,"To soften, had herself a sort of heart,"
10877,NINTH BOOK.,"And loved my mortal? He, at least, loved her;"
10878,NINTH BOOK.,"I heard him say so; ’twas my recompence,"
10879,NINTH BOOK.,"When, watching at his bedside fourteen days,"
10880,NINTH BOOK.,He broke out ever like a flame at whiles
10881,NINTH BOOK.,Between the heats of fever.... ‘Is it thou?
10882,NINTH BOOK.,"Breathe closer, sweetest mouth!’ and when at last"
10883,NINTH BOOK.,"The fever gone, the wasted face extinct"
10884,NINTH BOOK.,"As if it irked him much to know me there,"
10885,NINTH BOOK.,"He said, ‘’Twas kind, ’twas good, ’twas womanly,’"
10886,NINTH BOOK.,(And fifty praises to excuse one love)
10887,NINTH BOOK.,‘But was the picture safe he had ventured for?’
10888,NINTH BOOK.,"And then, half wandering ... ‘I have loved her well,"
10889,NINTH BOOK.,"Although she could not love me.’—‘Say instead,’"
10890,NINTH BOOK.,"I answered, ‘that she loves you.’—’Twas my turn"
10891,NINTH BOOK.,"To rave: (I would have married him so changed,"
10892,NINTH BOOK.,Although the world had jeered me properly
10893,NINTH BOOK.,"For taking up with Cupid at his worst,"
10894,NINTH BOOK.,The silver quiver worn off on his hair.)
10895,NINTH BOOK.,"‘No, no,’ he murmured, ‘no, she loves me not;"
10896,NINTH BOOK.,Aurora Leigh does better: bring her book
10897,NINTH BOOK.,"And read it softly, Lady Waldemar,"
10898,NINTH BOOK.,"Until I thank your friendship more for that,"
10899,NINTH BOOK.,Than even for harder service.’ So I read
10900,NINTH BOOK.,"Your book, Aurora, for an hour, that day:"
10901,NINTH BOOK.,"I kept its pauses, marked its emphasis;"
10902,NINTH BOOK.,"My voice, empaled upon rhyme’s golden hooks,"
10903,NINTH BOOK.,"Not once would writhe, nor quiver, nor revolt;"
10904,NINTH BOOK.,"I read on calmly,—calmly shut it up,"
10905,NINTH BOOK.,"Observing, ‘There’s some merit in the book."
10906,NINTH BOOK.,And yet the merit in’t is thrown away
10907,NINTH BOOK.,"As chances still with women, if we write"
10908,NINTH BOOK.,"Or write not: we want string to tie our flowers,"
10909,NINTH BOOK.,"So drop them as we walk, which serves to show"
10910,NINTH BOOK.,"The way we went. Good morning, Mister Leigh;"
10911,NINTH BOOK.,You’ll find another reader the next time.
10912,NINTH BOOK.,"A woman who does better than to love,"
10913,NINTH BOOK.,I hate; she will do nothing very well:
10914,NINTH BOOK.,"Male poets are preferable, tiring less"
10915,NINTH BOOK.,"And teaching more.’ I triumphed o’er you both,"
10916,NINTH BOOK.,And left him.
10917,NINTH BOOK.,"‘When I saw him afterward,"
10918,NINTH BOOK.,"I had read your shameful letter, and my heart."
10919,NINTH BOOK.,"He came with health recovered, strong though pale,"
10920,NINTH BOOK.,"Lord Howe and he, a courteous pair of friends,"
10921,NINTH BOOK.,"To say what men dare say to women, when"
10922,NINTH BOOK.,Their debtors. But I stopped them with a word;
10923,NINTH BOOK.,"And proved I had never trodden such a road,"
10924,NINTH BOOK.,To carry so much dirt upon my shoe.
10925,NINTH BOOK.,"Then, putting into it something of disdain,"
10926,NINTH BOOK.,"I asked forsooth his pardon, and my own,"
10927,NINTH BOOK.,"For having done no better than to love,"
10928,NINTH BOOK.,"And that, not wisely,—though ’twas long ago,"
10929,NINTH BOOK.,And though ’twas altered perfectly since then.
10930,NINTH BOOK.,"I told him, as I tell you now, Miss Leigh,"
10931,NINTH BOOK.,And proved I took some trouble for his sake
10932,NINTH BOOK.,(Because I knew he did not love the girl)
10933,NINTH BOOK.,To spoil my hands with working in the stream
10934,NINTH BOOK.,"Of that poor bubbling nature,—till she went,"
10935,NINTH BOOK.,"Consigned to one I trusted, my own maid,"
10936,NINTH BOOK.,"Who once had lived full five months in my house,"
10937,NINTH BOOK.,(Dressed hair superbly) with a lavish purse
10938,NINTH BOOK.,To carry to Australia where she had left
10939,NINTH BOOK.,"A husband, said she. If the creature lied,"
10940,NINTH BOOK.,"The mission failed, we all do fail and lie"
10941,NINTH BOOK.,More or less—and I’m sorry—which is all
10942,NINTH BOOK.,"Expected from us when we fail the most,"
10943,NINTH BOOK.,"And go to church to own it. What I meant,"
10944,NINTH BOOK.,"Was just the best for him, and me, and her ..."
10945,NINTH BOOK.,"Best even for Marian!—I am sorry for’t,"
10946,NINTH BOOK.,And very sorry. Yet my creature said
10947,NINTH BOOK.,She saw her stop to speak in Oxford Street
10948,NINTH BOOK.,To one ... no matter! I had sooner cut
10949,NINTH BOOK.,"My hand off (though ’twere kissed the hour before,"
10950,NINTH BOOK.,And promised a pearl troth-ring for the next)
10951,NINTH BOOK.,Than crush her silly head with so much wrong.
10952,NINTH BOOK.,"Poor child! I would have mended it with gold,"
10953,NINTH BOOK.,Until it gleamed like St. Sophia’s dome
10954,NINTH BOOK.,When all the faithful troop to morning prayer:
10955,NINTH BOOK.,"But he, he nipped the bud of such a thought"
10956,NINTH BOOK.,"With that cold Leigh look which I fancied once,"
10957,NINTH BOOK.,"And broke in, ‘Henceforth she was called his wife."
10958,NINTH BOOK.,His wife required no succour: he was bound
10959,NINTH BOOK.,"To Florence, to resume this broken bond:"
10960,NINTH BOOK.,"Enough so. Both were happy, he and Howe,"
10961,NINTH BOOK.,To acquit me of the heaviest charge of all—’
10962,NINTH BOOK.,—At which I shot my tongue against my fly
10963,NINTH BOOK.,"And struck him; ‘Would he carry,—he was just,—"
10964,NINTH BOOK.,"A letter from me to Aurora Leigh,"
10965,NINTH BOOK.,And ratify from his authentic mouth
10966,NINTH BOOK.,"My answer to her accusation?’—‘Yes,"
10967,NINTH BOOK.,If such a letter were prepared in time.’
10968,NINTH BOOK.,"—He’s just, your cousin,—ay, abhorrently."
10969,NINTH BOOK.,"He’d wash his hands in blood, to keep them clean."
10970,NINTH BOOK.,"And so, cold, courteous, a mere gentleman,"
10971,NINTH BOOK.,"He bowed, we parted."
10972,NINTH BOOK.,"‘Parted. Face no more,"
10973,NINTH BOOK.,"Voice no more, love no more! wiped wholly out"
10974,NINTH BOOK.,"Like some ill scholar’s scrawl from heart and slate,—"
10975,NINTH BOOK.,"Ay, spit on and so wiped out utterly"
10976,NINTH BOOK.,"By some coarse scholar! I have been too coarse,"
10977,NINTH BOOK.,"Too human. Have we business, in our rank,"
10978,NINTH BOOK.,With blood i’ the veins? I will have henceforth none;
10979,NINTH BOOK.,Not even to keep the colour at my lip.
10980,NINTH BOOK.,A rose is pink and pretty without blood;
10981,NINTH BOOK.,Why not a woman? When we’ve played in vain
10982,NINTH BOOK.,"The game, to adore,—we have resources still,"
10983,NINTH BOOK.,"And can play on at leisure, being adored:"
10984,NINTH BOOK.,Here’s Smith already swearing at my feet
10985,NINTH BOOK.,That I’m the typic She. Away with Smith!—
10986,NINTH BOOK.,"Smith smacks of Leigh,—and, henceforth, I’ll admit"
10987,NINTH BOOK.,"No socialist within three crinolines,"
10988,NINTH BOOK.,"To live and have his being. But for you,"
10989,NINTH BOOK.,"Though insolent your letter and absurd,"
10990,NINTH BOOK.,"And though I hate you frankly,—take my Smith!"
10991,NINTH BOOK.,"For when you have seen this famous marriage tied,"
10992,NINTH BOOK.,"A most unspotted Erle to a noble Leigh,"
10993,NINTH BOOK.,(His love astray on one he should not love)
10994,NINTH BOOK.,"Howbeit you should not want his love, beware,"
10995,NINTH BOOK.,You’ll want some comfort. So I leave you Smith;
10996,NINTH BOOK.,"Take Smith!—he talks Leigh’s subjects, somewhat worse;"
10997,NINTH BOOK.,"Adopts a thought of Leigh’s, and dwindles it;"
10998,NINTH BOOK.,"Goes leagues beyond, to be no inch behind;"
10999,NINTH BOOK.,"Will mind you of him, as a shoe-string may,"
11000,NINTH BOOK.,"Of a man: and women, when they are made like you,"
11001,NINTH BOOK.,"Grow tender to a shoe-string, footprint even,"
11002,NINTH BOOK.,"Adore averted shoulders in a glass,"
11003,NINTH BOOK.,"And memories of what, present once, was loathed."
11004,NINTH BOOK.,"And yet, you loathed not Romney,—though you’ve played"
11005,NINTH BOOK.,At ‘fox and goose’ about him with your soul:
11006,NINTH BOOK.,"Pass over fox, you rub out fox,—ignore"
11007,NINTH BOOK.,"A feeling, you eradicate it,—the act’s"
11008,NINTH BOOK.,Identical.
11009,NINTH BOOK.,"I wish you joy, Miss Leigh."
11010,NINTH BOOK.,You’ve made a happy marriage for your friend;
11011,NINTH BOOK.,"And all the honour, well-assorted love,"
11012,NINTH BOOK.,"Derives from you who love him, whom he loves!"
11013,NINTH BOOK.,"You need not wish _me_ joy to think of it,"
11014,NINTH BOOK.,"I have so much. Observe, Aurora Leigh;"
11015,NINTH BOOK.,"Your droop of eyelid is the same as his,"
11016,NINTH BOOK.,"And, but for you, I might have won his love,"
11017,NINTH BOOK.,"And, to you, I have shown my naked heart,—"
11018,NINTH BOOK.,"For which three things I hate, hate, hate you. Hush,"
11019,NINTH BOOK.,Suppose a fourth!—I cannot choose but think
11020,NINTH BOOK.,"That, with him, I were virtuouser than you"
11021,NINTH BOOK.,Without him: so I hate you from this gulf
11022,NINTH BOOK.,"And hollow of my soul, which opens out"
11023,NINTH BOOK.,"To what, except for you, had been my heaven,"
11024,NINTH BOOK.,"And is instead, a place to curse by! LOVE.’"
11025,NINTH BOOK.,
11026,NINTH BOOK.,An active kind of curse. I stood there cursed—
11027,NINTH BOOK.,Confounded. I had seized and caught the sense
11028,NINTH BOOK.,"Of the letter with its twenty stinging snakes,"
11029,NINTH BOOK.,"In a moment’s sweep of eyesight, and I stood"
11030,NINTH BOOK.,Dazed.—‘Ah!—not married.’
11031,NINTH BOOK.,"‘You mistake,’ he said;"
11032,NINTH BOOK.,‘I’m married. Is not Marian Erle my wife?
11033,NINTH BOOK.,"As God sees things, I have a wife and child;"
11034,NINTH BOOK.,"And I, as I’m a man who honours God,"
11035,NINTH BOOK.,Am here to claim them as my child and wife.’
11036,NINTH BOOK.,
11037,NINTH BOOK.,"I felt it hard to breathe, much less to speak."
11038,NINTH BOOK.,Nor word of mine was needed. Some one else
11039,NINTH BOOK.,"Was there for answering. ‘Romney,’ she began,"
11040,NINTH BOOK.,"‘My great good angel, Romney.’"
11041,NINTH BOOK.,"Then at first,"
11042,NINTH BOOK.,I knew that Marian Erle was beautiful.
11043,NINTH BOOK.,"She stood there, still and pallid as a saint,"
11044,NINTH BOOK.,"Dilated, like a saint in ecstasy,"
11045,NINTH BOOK.,As if the floating moonshine interposed
11046,NINTH BOOK.,"Betwixt her foot and the earth, and raised her up"
11047,NINTH BOOK.,"To float upon it. ‘I had left my child,"
11048,NINTH BOOK.,"Who sleeps,’ she said, ‘and, having drawn this way,"
11049,NINTH BOOK.,"I heard you speaking, ... friend!—Confirm me now."
11050,NINTH BOOK.,"You take this Marian, such as wicked men"
11051,NINTH BOOK.,"Have made her, for your honourable wife?’"
11052,NINTH BOOK.,
11053,NINTH BOOK.,"The thrilling, solemn, proud, pathetic voice."
11054,NINTH BOOK.,"He stretched his arms out toward the thrilling voice,"
11055,NINTH BOOK.,As if to draw it on to his embrace.
11056,NINTH BOOK.,"—‘I take her as God made her, and as men"
11057,NINTH BOOK.,"Must fail to unmake her, for my honoured wife.’"
11058,NINTH BOOK.,
11059,NINTH BOOK.,"She never raised her eyes, nor took a step,"
11060,NINTH BOOK.,"But stood there in her place, and spoke again."
11061,NINTH BOOK.,"—‘You take this Marian’s child, which is her shame"
11062,NINTH BOOK.,"In sight of men and women, for your child,"
11063,NINTH BOOK.,Of whom you will not ever feel ashamed?’
11064,NINTH BOOK.,
11065,NINTH BOOK.,"The thrilling, tender, proud, pathetic voice."
11066,NINTH BOOK.,"He stepped on toward it, still with outstretched arms,"
11067,NINTH BOOK.,As if to quench upon his breast that voice.
11068,NINTH BOOK.,"—‘May God so father me, as I do him,"
11069,NINTH BOOK.,And so forsake me as I let him feel
11070,NINTH BOOK.,He’s orphaned haply. Here I take the child
11071,NINTH BOOK.,"To share my cup, to slumber on my knee,"
11072,NINTH BOOK.,"To play his loudest gambol at my foot,"
11073,NINTH BOOK.,"To hold my finger in the public ways,"
11074,NINTH BOOK.,"Till none shall need inquire, ‘Whose child is this,’"
11075,NINTH BOOK.,"The gesture saying so tenderly, ‘My own’.’"
11076,NINTH BOOK.,
11077,NINTH BOOK.,She stood a moment silent in her place;
11078,NINTH BOOK.,"Then, turning toward me, very slow and cold—"
11079,NINTH BOOK.,"—‘And you,—what say you?—will you blame me much,"
11080,NINTH BOOK.,"If, careful for that outcast child of mine,"
11081,NINTH BOOK.,"I catch this hand that’s stretched to me and him,"
11082,NINTH BOOK.,Nor dare to leave him friendless in the world
11083,NINTH BOOK.,Where men have stoned me? Have I not the right
11084,NINTH BOOK.,"To take so mere an aftermath from life,"
11085,NINTH BOOK.,Else found so wholly bare? Or is it wrong
11086,NINTH BOOK.,"To let your cousin, for a generous bent,"
11087,NINTH BOOK.,Put out his ungloved fingers among briars
11088,NINTH BOOK.,To set a tumbling bird’s-nest somewhat straight?
11089,NINTH BOOK.,"You will not tell him, though we’re innocent"
11090,NINTH BOOK.,We are not harmless?... and that both our harms
11091,NINTH BOOK.,"Will stick to his good smooth noble life like burrs,"
11092,NINTH BOOK.,Never to drop off though you shake the cloak?
11093,NINTH BOOK.,You’ve been my friend: you will not now be his?
11094,NINTH BOOK.,"You’ve known him, that he’s worthy of a friend;"
11095,NINTH BOOK.,"And you’re his cousin, lady, after all,"
11096,NINTH BOOK.,"And therefore more than free to take his part,"
11097,NINTH BOOK.,"Explaining, since the nest is surely spoilt,"
11098,NINTH BOOK.,"And Marian what you know her,—though a wife,"
11099,NINTH BOOK.,The world would hardly understand her case
11100,NINTH BOOK.,"Of being just hurt and honest; while for him,"
11101,NINTH BOOK.,’Twould ever twit him with his bastard child
11102,NINTH BOOK.,"And married harlot. Speak, while yet there’s time:"
11103,NINTH BOOK.,You would not stand and let a good man’s dog
11104,NINTH BOOK.,"Turn round and rend him, because his, and reared"
11105,NINTH BOOK.,"Of a generous breed,—and will you let his act,"
11106,NINTH BOOK.,"Because it’s generous? Speak. I’m bound to you,"
11107,NINTH BOOK.,"And I’ll be bound by only you, in this.’"
11108,NINTH BOOK.,"The thrilling, solemn voice, so passionless,"
11109,NINTH BOOK.,"Sustained, yet low, without a rise or fall,"
11110,NINTH BOOK.,"As one who had authority to speak,"
11111,NINTH BOOK.,And not as Marian.
11112,NINTH BOOK.,I looked up to feel
11113,NINTH BOOK.,"If God stood near me, and beheld his heaven"
11114,NINTH BOOK.,As blue as Aaron’s priestly robe appeared
11115,NINTH BOOK.,To Aaron when he took it off to die.
11116,NINTH BOOK.,"And then I spoke—‘Accept the gift, I say,"
11117,NINTH BOOK.,"My sister Marian, and be satisfied."
11118,NINTH BOOK.,"The hand that gives, has still a soul behind"
11119,NINTH BOOK.,"Which will not let it quail for having given,"
11120,NINTH BOOK.,"Though foolish worldlings talk they know not what,"
11121,NINTH BOOK.,Of what they know not. Romney’s strong enough
11122,NINTH BOOK.,For this: do you be strong to know he’s strong:
11123,NINTH BOOK.,"He stands on Right’s side; never flinch for him,"
11124,NINTH BOOK.,As if he stood on the other. You’ll be bound
11125,NINTH BOOK.,By me? I am a woman of repute;
11126,NINTH BOOK.,No fly-blow gossip ever specked my life;
11127,NINTH BOOK.,"My name is clean and open as this hand,"
11128,NINTH BOOK.,"Whose glove there’s not a man dares blab about,"
11129,NINTH BOOK.,As if he had touched it freely:—here’s my hand
11130,NINTH BOOK.,"To clasp your hand, my Marian, owned as pure!"
11131,NINTH BOOK.,"As pure,—as I’m a woman and a Leigh!—"
11132,NINTH BOOK.,"And, as I’m both, I’ll witness to the world"
11133,NINTH BOOK.,"That Romney Leigh is honoured in his choice,"
11134,NINTH BOOK.,Who chooses Marian for his honoured wife.’
11135,NINTH BOOK.,
11136,NINTH BOOK.,Her broad wild woodland eyes shot out a light;
11137,NINTH BOOK.,"Her smile was wonderful for rapture. ‘Thanks,"
11138,NINTH BOOK.,"My great Aurora.’ Forward then she sprang,"
11139,NINTH BOOK.,And dropping her impassioned spaniel head
11140,NINTH BOOK.,With all its brown abandonment of curls
11141,NINTH BOOK.,"On Romney’s feet, we heard the kisses drawn"
11142,NINTH BOOK.,"Through sobs upon the foot, upon the ground—"
11143,NINTH BOOK.,"O Romney! O my angel! O unchanged,"
11144,NINTH BOOK.,"Though, since we’ve parted, I have past the grave!"
11145,NINTH BOOK.,"But Death itself could only better _thee_,"
11146,NINTH BOOK.,Not change thee!—_Thee_ I do not thank at all:
11147,NINTH BOOK.,"I but thank God who made thee what thou art,"
11148,NINTH BOOK.,So wholly godlike.’
11149,NINTH BOOK.,When he tried in vain
11150,NINTH BOOK.,"To raise her to his embrace, escaping thence"
11151,NINTH BOOK.,"As any leaping fawn from a huntsman’s grasp,"
11152,NINTH BOOK.,"She bounded off and ‘lighted beyond reach,"
11153,NINTH BOOK.,"Before him, with a staglike majesty"
11154,NINTH BOOK.,"Of soft, serene defiance,—as she knew"
11155,NINTH BOOK.,"He could not touch her, so was tolerant"
11156,NINTH BOOK.,He had cared to try. She stood there with her great
11157,NINTH BOOK.,"Drowned eyes, and dripping cheeks, and strange sweet smile"
11158,NINTH BOOK.,"That lived through all, as if one held a light"
11159,NINTH BOOK.,"Across a waste of waters,—shook her head"
11160,NINTH BOOK.,"To keep some thoughts down deeper in her soul,—"
11161,NINTH BOOK.,"Then, white and tranquil as a summer-cloud"
11162,NINTH BOOK.,"Which, having rained itself to a tardy peace,"
11163,NINTH BOOK.,"Stands still in heaven as if it ruled the day,"
11164,NINTH BOOK.,"Spoke out again—‘Although, my generous friend,"
11165,NINTH BOOK.,"Since last we met and parted, you’re unchanged,"
11166,NINTH BOOK.,"And, having promised faith to Marian Erle,"
11167,NINTH BOOK.,"Maintain it, as she were not changed at all;"
11168,NINTH BOOK.,"And though that’s worthy, though that’s full of balm"
11169,NINTH BOOK.,To any conscious spirit of a girl
11170,NINTH BOOK.,"Who once has loved you as I loved you once,—"
11171,NINTH BOOK.,"Yet still it will not make her ... if she’s dead,"
11172,NINTH BOOK.,And gone away where none can give or take
11173,NINTH BOOK.,"In marriage,—able to revive, return"
11174,NINTH BOOK.,"And wed you,—will it, Romney? Here’s the point;"
11175,NINTH BOOK.,"O friend, we’ll see it plainer: you and I"
11176,NINTH BOOK.,"Must never, never, never join hands so."
11177,NINTH BOOK.,"Nay, let me say it,—for I said it first"
11178,NINTH BOOK.,"To God, and placed it, rounded to an oath,"
11179,NINTH BOOK.,"Far, far above the moon there, at His feet,"
11180,NINTH BOOK.,"As surely as I wept just now at yours,—"
11181,NINTH BOOK.,"We never, never, never join hands so."
11182,NINTH BOOK.,"And now, be patient with me; do not think"
11183,NINTH BOOK.,I’m speaking from a false humility.
11184,NINTH BOOK.,"The truth is, I am grown so proud with grief,"
11185,NINTH BOOK.,And He has said so often through his nights
11186,NINTH BOOK.,"And through his mornings, ‘Weep a little still,"
11187,NINTH BOOK.,"Thou foolish Marian, because women must,"
11188,NINTH BOOK.,"But do not blush at all except for sin,’—"
11189,NINTH BOOK.,"That I, who felt myself unworthy once"
11190,NINTH BOOK.,"Of virtuous Romney and his high-born race,"
11191,NINTH BOOK.,"Have come to learn, ... a woman, poor or rich,"
11192,NINTH BOOK.,"Despised or honoured, is a human soul;"
11193,NINTH BOOK.,"And what her soul is,—that, she is herself,"
11194,NINTH BOOK.,"Although she should be spit upon of men,"
11195,NINTH BOOK.,"As is the pavement of the churches here,"
11196,NINTH BOOK.,"Still good enough to pray in. And, being chaste"
11197,NINTH BOOK.,"And honest, and inclined to do the right,"
11198,NINTH BOOK.,"And love the truth, and live my life out green"
11199,NINTH BOOK.,"And smooth beneath his steps, I should not fear"
11200,NINTH BOOK.,"To make him, thus, a less uneasy time"
11201,NINTH BOOK.,Than many a happier woman. Very proud
11202,NINTH BOOK.,"You see me. Pardon, that I set a trap"
11203,NINTH BOOK.,To hear a confirmation in your voice ...
11204,NINTH BOOK.,Both yours and yours. It is so good to know
11205,NINTH BOOK.,’Twas really God who said the same before:
11206,NINTH BOOK.,"For thus it is in heaven, that first God speaks,"
11207,NINTH BOOK.,"And then his angels. Oh, it does me good,"
11208,NINTH BOOK.,"It wipes me clean and sweet from devil’s dirt,"
11209,NINTH BOOK.,That Romney Leigh should think me worthy still
11210,NINTH BOOK.,Of being his true and honourable wife!
11211,NINTH BOOK.,"Henceforth I need not say, on leaving earth,"
11212,NINTH BOOK.,"I had no glory in it. For the rest,"
11213,NINTH BOOK.,"The reason’s ready (master, angel, friend,"
11214,NINTH BOOK.,Be patient with me) wherefore you and I
11215,NINTH BOOK.,"Can never, never, never join hands so."
11216,NINTH BOOK.,I know you’ll not be angry like a man
11217,NINTH BOOK.,"(For _you_ are none) when I shall tell the truth,—"
11218,NINTH BOOK.,"Which is, I do not love you, Romney Leigh,"
11219,NINTH BOOK.,"I do not love you. Ah well! catch my hands,"
11220,NINTH BOOK.,"Miss Leigh, and burn into my eyes with yours,—"
11221,NINTH BOOK.,I swear I do not love him. Did I once?
11222,NINTH BOOK.,"’Tis said that women have been bruised to death,"
11223,NINTH BOOK.,"And yet, if once they loved, that love of theirs"
11224,NINTH BOOK.,Could never be drained out with all their blood:
11225,NINTH BOOK.,I’ve heard such things and pondered. Did I indeed
11226,NINTH BOOK.,"Love once? or did I only worship? Yes,"
11227,NINTH BOOK.,"Perhaps, O friend, I set you up so high"
11228,NINTH BOOK.,"Above all actual good or hope of good,"
11229,NINTH BOOK.,"Or fear of evil, all that could be mine,"
11230,NINTH BOOK.,"I haply set you above love itself,"
11231,NINTH BOOK.,"And out of reach of these poor woman’s arms,"
11232,NINTH BOOK.,Angelic Romney. What was in my thought?
11233,NINTH BOOK.,"To be your slave, your help, your toy, your tool."
11234,NINTH BOOK.,To be your love ... I never thought of that.
11235,NINTH BOOK.,To give you love ... still less. I gave you love?
11236,NINTH BOOK.,I think I did not give you anything;
11237,NINTH BOOK.,"I was but only yours,—upon my knees,"
11238,NINTH BOOK.,"All yours, in soul and body, in head and heart,—"
11239,NINTH BOOK.,"A creature you had taken from the ground,"
11240,NINTH BOOK.,Still crumbling through your fingers to your feet
11241,NINTH BOOK.,"To join the dust she came from. Did I love,"
11242,NINTH BOOK.,"Or did I worship? judge, Aurora Leigh!"
11243,NINTH BOOK.,"But, if indeed I loved, ’twas long ago,—"
11244,NINTH BOOK.,"So long! before the sun and moon were made,"
11245,NINTH BOOK.,"Before the hells were open,—ah, before"
11246,NINTH BOOK.,"I heard my child cry in the desert night,"
11247,NINTH BOOK.,"And knew he had no father. It may be,"
11248,NINTH BOOK.,"I’m not as strong as other women are,"
11249,NINTH BOOK.,"Who, torn and crushed, are not undone from love."
11250,NINTH BOOK.,"It may be, I am colder than the dead,"
11251,NINTH BOOK.,"Who, being dead, love always. But for me"
11252,NINTH BOOK.,"Once killed, ... this ghost of Marian loves no more,"
11253,NINTH BOOK.,No more ... except the child!... no more at all.
11254,NINTH BOOK.,"I told your cousin, sir, that I was dead;"
11255,NINTH BOOK.,"And now, she thinks I’ll get up from my grave,"
11256,NINTH BOOK.,"And wear my chin-cloth for a wedding-veil,"
11257,NINTH BOOK.,"And glide along the churchyard like a bride,"
11258,NINTH BOOK.,"While all the dead keep whispering through the withes,"
11259,NINTH BOOK.,"‘You would be better in your place with us,"
11260,NINTH BOOK.,"You pitiful corruption!’ At the thought,"
11261,NINTH BOOK.,"The damps break out on me like leprosy,"
11262,NINTH BOOK.,"Although I’m clean. Ay, clean as Marian Erle:"
11263,NINTH BOOK.,"As Marian Leigh, I know, I were not clean:"
11264,NINTH BOOK.,"I have not so much life that I should love,"
11265,NINTH BOOK.,... Except the child. Ah God! I could not bear
11266,NINTH BOOK.,"To see my darling on a good man’s knees,"
11267,NINTH BOOK.,"And know by such a look, or such a sigh,"
11268,NINTH BOOK.,"Or such a silence, that he thought sometimes,"
11269,NINTH BOOK.,‘This child was fathered by some cursed wretch’ ...
11270,NINTH BOOK.,"For, Romney,—angels are less tender-wise"
11271,NINTH BOOK.,Than God and mothers: even _you_ would think
11272,NINTH BOOK.,"What _we_ think never. He is ours, the child;"
11273,NINTH BOOK.,And we would sooner vex a soul in heaven
11274,NINTH BOOK.,"By coupling with it the dead body’s thought,"
11275,NINTH BOOK.,"It left behind it in a last month’s grave,"
11276,NINTH BOOK.,"Than, in my child, see other than ... my child."
11277,NINTH BOOK.,"We only, never call him fatherless"
11278,NINTH BOOK.,"Who has God and his mother. O my babe,"
11279,NINTH BOOK.,"My pretty, pretty blossom, an ill-wind"
11280,NINTH BOOK.,Once blew upon my breast! can any think
11281,NINTH BOOK.,"I’d have another,—one called happier,"
11282,NINTH BOOK.,"A fathered child, with father’s love and race"
11283,NINTH BOOK.,"That’s worn as bold and open as a smile,"
11284,NINTH BOOK.,To vex my darling when he’s asked his name
11285,NINTH BOOK.,And has no answer? What! a happier child
11286,NINTH BOOK.,"Than mine, my best,—who laughed so loud to-night"
11287,NINTH BOOK.,"He could not sleep for pastime? Nay, I swear"
11288,NINTH BOOK.,"By life and love, that, if I lived like some,"
11289,NINTH BOOK.,"And loved like ... _some_ ... ay, loved you, Romney Leigh,"
11290,NINTH BOOK.,"As some love (eyes that have wept so much, see clear),"
11291,NINTH BOOK.,I’ve room for no more children in my arms;
11292,NINTH BOOK.,My kisses are all melted on one mouth;
11293,NINTH BOOK.,I would not push my darling to a stool
11294,NINTH BOOK.,"To dandle babies. Here’s a hand, shall keep"
11295,NINTH BOOK.,"For ever clean without a marriage-ring,"
11296,NINTH BOOK.,"To tend my boy, until he cease to need"
11297,NINTH BOOK.,"One steadying finger of it, and desert"
11298,NINTH BOOK.,"(Not miss) his mother’s lap, to sit with men."
11299,NINTH BOOK.,And when I miss him (not he me) I’ll come
11300,NINTH BOOK.,"And say, ‘Now give me some of Romney’s work,"
11301,NINTH BOOK.,"To help your outcast orphans of the world,"
11302,NINTH BOOK.,"And comfort grief with grief.’ For you, meantime,"
11303,NINTH BOOK.,"Most noble Romney, wed a noble wife,"
11304,NINTH BOOK.,"And open on each other your great souls,—"
11305,NINTH BOOK.,I need not farther bless you. If I dared
11306,NINTH BOOK.,"But strain and touch her in her upper sphere,"
11307,NINTH BOOK.,"And say, ‘Come down to Romney—pay my debt!’"
11308,NINTH BOOK.,I should be joyful with the stream of joy
11309,NINTH BOOK.,Sent through me. But the moon is in my face ...
11310,NINTH BOOK.,"I dare not,—though I guess the name he loves;"
11311,NINTH BOOK.,"I’m learned with my studies of old days,"
11312,NINTH BOOK.,Remembering how he crushed his under-lip
11313,NINTH BOOK.,"When some one came and spoke, or did not come:"
11314,NINTH BOOK.,"Aurora, I could touch her with my hand,"
11315,NINTH BOOK.,"And fly, because I dare not.’"
11316,NINTH BOOK.,She was gone.
11317,NINTH BOOK.,He smiled so sternly that I spoke in haste.
11318,NINTH BOOK.,‘Forgive her—she sees clearly for herself:
11319,NINTH BOOK.,"Her instinct’s holy,’"
11320,NINTH BOOK.,"‘_I_ forgive?’ he said,"
11321,NINTH BOOK.,"‘I only marvel how she sees so sure,"
11322,NINTH BOOK.,"While others’ ... there he paused,—then hoarse, abrupt,—"
11323,NINTH BOOK.,"Aurora! you forgive us, her and me?"
11324,NINTH BOOK.,"For her, the thing she sees, poor loyal child,"
11325,NINTH BOOK.,"If once corrected by the thing I know,"
11326,NINTH BOOK.,"Had been unspoken; since she loves you well,"
11327,NINTH BOOK.,"Has leave to love you:—while for me, alas,"
11328,NINTH BOOK.,If once or twice I let my heart escape
11329,NINTH BOOK.,"This night, ... remember, where hearts slip and fall"
11330,NINTH BOOK.,"They break beside: we’re parting,—parting,—ah,"
11331,NINTH BOOK.,"You do not love, that you should surely know"
11332,NINTH BOOK.,"What that word means. Forgive, be tolerant;"
11333,NINTH BOOK.,"It had not been, but that I felt myself"
11334,NINTH BOOK.,"So safe in impuissance and despair,"
11335,NINTH BOOK.,I could not hurt you though I tossed my arms
11336,NINTH BOOK.,And sighed my soul out. The most utter wretch
11337,NINTH BOOK.,"Will choose his postures when he comes to die,"
11338,NINTH BOOK.,However in the presence of a queen;
11339,NINTH BOOK.,And you’ll forgive me some unseemly spasms
11340,NINTH BOOK.,Which meant no more than dying. Do you think
11341,NINTH BOOK.,"I had ever come here in my perfect mind,"
11342,NINTH BOOK.,"Unless I had come here, in my settled mind,"
11343,NINTH BOOK.,"Bound Marian’s, bound to keep the bond, and give"
11344,NINTH BOOK.,"My name, my house, my hand, the things I could,"
11345,NINTH BOOK.,To Marian? For even _I_ could give as much;
11346,NINTH BOOK.,"Even I, affronting her exalted soul"
11347,NINTH BOOK.,"By a supposition that she wanted these,"
11348,NINTH BOOK.,Could act the husband’s coat and hat set up
11349,NINTH BOOK.,To creak i’ the wind and drive the world-crows off
11350,NINTH BOOK.,From pecking in her garden. Straw can fill
11351,NINTH BOOK.,"A hole to keep out vermin. Now, at last,"
11352,NINTH BOOK.,I own heaven’s angels round her life suffice
11353,NINTH BOOK.,"To fight the rats of our society,"
11354,NINTH BOOK.,Without this Romney: I can see it at last;
11355,NINTH BOOK.,And here is ended my pretension which
11356,NINTH BOOK.,"The most pretended. Over-proud of course,"
11357,NINTH BOOK.,"Even so!—but not so stupid ... blind ... that I,"
11358,NINTH BOOK.,Whom thus the great Taskmaster of the world
11359,NINTH BOOK.,"Has set to meditate mistaken work,"
11360,NINTH BOOK.,My dreary face against a dim blank wall
11361,NINTH BOOK.,"Throughout man’s natural lifetime,—could pretend"
11362,NINTH BOOK.,"Or wish ... O love, I have loved you! O my soul,"
11363,NINTH BOOK.,"I have lost you!—but I swear by all yourself,"
11364,NINTH BOOK.,"And all you might have been to me these years,"
11365,NINTH BOOK.,"If that June-morning had not failed my hope,—"
11366,NINTH BOOK.,"I’m not so bestial, to regret that day"
11367,NINTH BOOK.,"This night,—this night, which still to you is fair;"
11368,NINTH BOOK.,"Nay, not so blind, Aurora. I attest"
11369,NINTH BOOK.,"Those stars above us, which I cannot see ...’"
11370,NINTH BOOK.,
11371,NINTH BOOK.,‘You cannot’....
11372,NINTH BOOK.,"‘That if Heaven itself should stoop,"
11373,NINTH BOOK.,"Remix the lots, and give me another chance,"
11374,NINTH BOOK.,"I’d say, ‘No other!’—I’d record my blank."
11375,NINTH BOOK.,Aurora never should be wife of mine.’
11376,NINTH BOOK.,‘Not see the stars?’
11377,NINTH BOOK.,"‘’Tis worse still, not to see"
11378,NINTH BOOK.,"To find your hand, although we’re parting, dear."
11379,NINTH BOOK.,"A moment let me hold it, ere we part;"
11380,NINTH BOOK.,"And understand my last words—these, at last!"
11381,NINTH BOOK.,"I would not have you thinking, when I’m gone,"
11382,NINTH BOOK.,"That Romney dared to hanker for your love,"
11383,NINTH BOOK.,"In thought or vision, if attainable,"
11384,NINTH BOOK.,(Which certainly for me it never was)
11385,NINTH BOOK.,"And wish to use it for a dog to-day,"
11386,NINTH BOOK.,To help the blind man stumbling. God forbid!
11387,NINTH BOOK.,"And now I know He held you in his palm,"
11388,NINTH BOOK.,"And kept you open-eyed to all my faults,"
11389,NINTH BOOK.,To save you at last from such a dreary end.
11390,NINTH BOOK.,"Believe me, dear, that if I had known, like Him,"
11391,NINTH BOOK.,"What loss was coming on me, I had done"
11392,NINTH BOOK.,"As well in this as He has.—Farewell, you,"
11393,NINTH BOOK.,"Who are still my light,—farewell! How late it is:"
11394,NINTH BOOK.,"I know that, now: you’ve been too patient, sweet."
11395,NINTH BOOK.,"I will but blow my whistle toward the lane,"
11396,NINTH BOOK.,And some one comes ... the same who brought me here.
11397,NINTH BOOK.,Get in—Good night.’
11398,NINTH BOOK.,‘A moment. Heavenly Christ!
11399,NINTH BOOK.,"A moment. Speak once, Romney. ‘’Tis not true."
11400,NINTH BOOK.,"I hold your hands, I look into your face—"
11401,NINTH BOOK.,You see me?’
11402,NINTH BOOK.,‘No more than the blessed stars.
11403,NINTH BOOK.,"Be blessed too, Aurora. Ah, my sweet,"
11404,NINTH BOOK.,You tremble. Tender-hearted! Do you mind
11405,NINTH BOOK.,"Of yore, dear, how you used to cheat old John,"
11406,NINTH BOOK.,"And let the mice out slily from his traps,"
11407,NINTH BOOK.,Until he marvelled at the soul in mice
11408,NINTH BOOK.,Which took the cheese and left the snare? The same
11409,NINTH BOOK.,"Dear soft heart always! ’Twas for this, I grieved"
11410,NINTH BOOK.,"Howe’s letter never reached you. Ah, you had heard"
11411,NINTH BOOK.,"Of illness,—not the issue ... not the extent:"
11412,NINTH BOOK.,My life long sick with tossings up and down;
11413,NINTH BOOK.,"The sudden revulsion in the blazing house,—"
11414,NINTH BOOK.,"The strain and struggle both of body and soul,"
11415,NINTH BOOK.,"Which left fire running in my veins, for blood:"
11416,NINTH BOOK.,"Scarce lacked that thunderbolt of the falling beam,"
11417,NINTH BOOK.,Which nicked me on the forehead as I passed
11418,NINTH BOOK.,"The gallery-door with a burden. Say heaven’s bolt,"
11419,NINTH BOOK.,Not William Erie’s; not Marian’s father’s; tramp
11420,NINTH BOOK.,"And poacher, whom I found for what he was,"
11421,NINTH BOOK.,"And, eager for her sake to rescue him,"
11422,NINTH BOOK.,"Forth swept from the open highway of the world,"
11423,NINTH BOOK.,"Road-dust and all,—till, like a woodland boar"
11424,NINTH BOOK.,"Most naturally unwilling to be tamed,"
11425,NINTH BOOK.,He notched me with his tooth. But not a word
11426,NINTH BOOK.,"To Marian! and I do not think, besides,"
11427,NINTH BOOK.,"He turned the tilting of the beam my way,—"
11428,NINTH BOOK.,"And if he laughed, as many swear, poor wretch,"
11429,NINTH BOOK.,Nor he nor I supposed the hurt so deep.
11430,NINTH BOOK.,"We’ll hope his next laugh may be merrier,"
11431,NINTH BOOK.,In a better cause.’
11432,NINTH BOOK.,"‘Blind, Romney?’"
11433,NINTH BOOK.,"‘Ah, my friend,"
11434,NINTH BOOK.,You’ll learn to say it in a cheerful voice.
11435,NINTH BOOK.,"I, too, at first desponded. To be blind,"
11436,NINTH BOOK.,"Turned out of nature, mulcted as a man,"
11437,NINTH BOOK.,Refused the daily largesse of the sun
11438,NINTH BOOK.,To humble creatures! When the fever’s heat
11439,NINTH BOOK.,"Dropped from me, as the flame did from my house,"
11440,NINTH BOOK.,"And left me ruined like it, stripped of all"
11441,NINTH BOOK.,"The hues and shapes of aspectable life,"
11442,NINTH BOOK.,"A mere bare blind stone in the blaze of day,"
11443,NINTH BOOK.,"A man, upon the outside of the earth,"
11444,NINTH BOOK.,"As dark as ten feet under, in the grave,—"
11445,NINTH BOOK.,Why that seemed hard.’
11446,NINTH BOOK.,‘No hope?’
11447,NINTH BOOK.,"‘A tear! you weep,"
11448,NINTH BOOK.,Divine Aurora? tears upon my hand!
11449,NINTH BOOK.,"I’ve seen you weeping for a mouse, a bird,—"
11450,NINTH BOOK.,"But, weep for me, Aurora? Yes, there’s hope."
11451,NINTH BOOK.,"Not hope of sight,—I could be learned, dear,"
11452,NINTH BOOK.,And tell you in what Greek and Latin name
11453,NINTH BOOK.,"The visual nerve is withered to the root,"
11454,NINTH BOOK.,"Though the outer eyes appear indifferent,"
11455,NINTH BOOK.,Unspotted in their chrystals. But there’s hope.
11456,NINTH BOOK.,"The spirit, from behind this dethroned sense,"
11457,NINTH BOOK.,"Sees, waits in patience till the walls break up"
11458,NINTH BOOK.,From which the bas-relief and fresco have dropt:
11459,NINTH BOOK.,"There’s hope. The man here, once so arrogant"
11460,NINTH BOOK.,"And restless, so ambitious, for his part,"
11461,NINTH BOOK.,Of dealing with statistically packed
11462,NINTH BOOK.,"Disorders, (from a pattern on his nail,)"
11463,NINTH BOOK.,"And packing such things quite another way,—"
11464,NINTH BOOK.,Is now contented. From his personal loss
11465,NINTH BOOK.,"He has come to hope for others when they lose,"
11466,NINTH BOOK.,And wear a gladder faith in what we gain ...
11467,NINTH BOOK.,"Through bitter experience, compensation sweet,"
11468,NINTH BOOK.,"Like that tear, sweetest. I am quiet now,—"
11469,NINTH BOOK.,"As tender surely for the suffering world,"
11470,NINTH BOOK.,"But quiet,—sitting at the wall to learn,"
11471,NINTH BOOK.,"Content, henceforth, to do the thing I can:"
11472,NINTH BOOK.,"For, though as powerless, said I, as a stone,"
11473,NINTH BOOK.,"A stone can still give shelter to a worm,"
11474,NINTH BOOK.,And it is worth while being a stone for that:
11475,NINTH BOOK.,"There’s hope, Aurora.’"
11476,NINTH BOOK.,‘Is there hope for me?
11477,NINTH BOOK.,For me?—and is there room beneath the stone
11478,NINTH BOOK.,For such a worm?—And if I came and said ...
11479,NINTH BOOK.,"What all this weeping scarce will let me say,"
11480,NINTH BOOK.,"And yet what women cannot say at all,"
11481,NINTH BOOK.,"But weeping bitterly ... (the pride keeps up,"
11482,NINTH BOOK.,"Until the heart breaks under it) ... I love,—"
11483,NINTH BOOK.,"I love you, Romney’...."
11484,NINTH BOOK.,‘Silence!’ he exclaimed.
11485,NINTH BOOK.,‘A woman’s pity sometimes makes her mad.
11486,NINTH BOOK.,A man’s distraction must not cheat his soul

11488,NINTH BOOK.,"Farewell, Aurora.’"
11489,NINTH BOOK.,"‘But I love you, sir;"
11490,NINTH BOOK.,"And when a woman says she loves a man,"
11491,NINTH BOOK.,"The man must hear her, though he love her not,"
11492,NINTH BOOK.,Which ... hush!... he has leave to answer in his turn;
11493,NINTH BOOK.,"She will not surely blame him. As for me,"
11494,NINTH BOOK.,"You call it pity,—think I’m generous?"
11495,NINTH BOOK.,"’Twere somewhat easier, for a woman proud"
11496,NINTH BOOK.,"As I am, and I’m very vilely proud,"
11497,NINTH BOOK.,"To let it pass as such, and press on you"
11498,NINTH BOOK.,"Love born of pity,—seeing that excellent loves"
11499,NINTH BOOK.,"Are born so, often, nor the quicklier die,—"
11500,NINTH BOOK.,And this would set me higher by the head
11501,NINTH BOOK.,Than now I stand. No matter: let the truth
11502,NINTH BOOK.,"Stand high; Aurora must be humble: no,"
11503,NINTH BOOK.,My love’s not pity merely. Obviously
11504,NINTH BOOK.,"I’m not a generous woman, never was,"
11505,NINTH BOOK.,"Or else, of old, I had not looked so near"
11506,NINTH BOOK.,"To weights and measures, grudging you the power"
11507,NINTH BOOK.,"To give, as first I scorned your power to judge"
11508,NINTH BOOK.,"For me, Aurora: I would have no gifts"
11509,NINTH BOOK.,"Forsooth, but God’s,—and I would use _them_, too,"
11510,NINTH BOOK.,"According to my pleasure and my choice,"
11511,NINTH BOOK.,"As He and I were equals,—you, below,"
11512,NINTH BOOK.,Excluded from that level of interchange
11513,NINTH BOOK.,Admitting benefaction. You were wrong
11514,NINTH BOOK.,In much? you said so. I was wrong in most.
11515,NINTH BOOK.,"Oh, most! You only thought to rescue men"
11516,NINTH BOOK.,"By half-means, half-way, seeing half their wants,"
11517,NINTH BOOK.,While thinking nothing of your personal gain.
11518,NINTH BOOK.,"But I who saw the human nature broad,"
11519,NINTH BOOK.,"At both sides, comprehending, too, the soul’s,"
11520,NINTH BOOK.,"And all the high necessities of Art,"
11521,NINTH BOOK.,"Betrayed the thing I saw, and wronged my own life"
11522,NINTH BOOK.,For which I pleaded. Passioned to exalt
11523,NINTH BOOK.,The artist’s instinct in me at the cost
11524,NINTH BOOK.,"Of putting down the woman’s,—I forgot"
11525,NINTH BOOK.,No perfect artist is developed here
11526,NINTH BOOK.,"From any imperfect woman. Flower from root,"
11527,NINTH BOOK.,"And spiritual from natural, grade by grade"
11528,NINTH BOOK.,In all our life. A handful of the earth
11529,NINTH BOOK.,"To make God’s image! the despised poor earth,"
11530,NINTH BOOK.,"The healthy odorous earth,—I missed, with it,"
11531,NINTH BOOK.,The divine Breath that blows the nostrils out
11532,NINTH BOOK.,"To ineffable inflatus: ay, the breath"
11533,NINTH BOOK.,"Which love is. Art is much, but love is more."
11534,NINTH BOOK.,"O Art, my Art, thou’rt much, but Love is more!"
11535,NINTH BOOK.,"Art symbolises heaven, but Love is God"
11536,NINTH BOOK.,"And makes heaven. I, Aurora, fell from mine:"
11537,NINTH BOOK.,"I would not be a woman like the rest,"
11538,NINTH BOOK.,"A simple woman who believes in love,"
11539,NINTH BOOK.,"And owns the right of love because she loves,"
11540,NINTH BOOK.,"And, hearing she’s beloved, is satisfied"
11541,NINTH BOOK.,"With what contents God: I must analyse,"
11542,NINTH BOOK.,"Confront, and question; just as if a fly"
11543,NINTH BOOK.,Refused to warm itself in any sun
11544,NINTH BOOK.,Till such was _in leone_: I must fret
11545,NINTH BOOK.,"Forsooth, because the month was only May;"
11546,NINTH BOOK.,"Be faithless of the kind of proffered love,"
11547,NINTH BOOK.,"And captious, lest it miss my dignity,"
11548,NINTH BOOK.,"And scornful, that my lover sought a wife"
11549,NINTH BOOK.,"To use ... to use! O Romney, O my love,"
11550,NINTH BOOK.,"I am changed since then, changed wholly,—for indeed,"
11551,NINTH BOOK.,"If now you’d stoop so low to take my love,"
11552,NINTH BOOK.,"And use it roughly, without stint or spare,"
11553,NINTH BOOK.,"As men use common things with more behind,"
11554,NINTH BOOK.,"(And, in this, ever would be more behind)"
11555,NINTH BOOK.,"To any mean and ordinary end,—"
11556,NINTH BOOK.,"The joy would set me like a star, in heaven,"
11557,NINTH BOOK.,"So high up, I should shine because of height"
11558,NINTH BOOK.,"And not of virtue. Yet in one respect,"
11559,NINTH BOOK.,"Just one, beloved, I am in no wise changed:"
11560,NINTH BOOK.,"I love you, loved you ... loved you first and last,"
11561,NINTH BOOK.,And love you on for ever. Now I know
11562,NINTH BOOK.,"I loved you always, Romney. She who died"
11563,NINTH BOOK.,"Knew that, and said so; Lady Waldemar"
11564,NINTH BOOK.,Knows that; ... and Marian: I had known the same
11565,NINTH BOOK.,"Except that I was prouder than I knew,"
11566,NINTH BOOK.,"And not so honest. Ay, and, as I live,"
11567,NINTH BOOK.,"I should have died so, crushing in my hand"
11568,NINTH BOOK.,"This rose of love, the wasp inside and all,—"
11569,NINTH BOOK.,Ignoring ever to my soul and you
11570,NINTH BOOK.,"Both rose and pain,—except for this great loss,"
11571,NINTH BOOK.,"This great despair,—to stand before your face"
11572,NINTH BOOK.,And know I cannot win a look of yours.
11573,NINTH BOOK.,"You think, perhaps, I am not changed from pride,"
11574,NINTH BOOK.,"And that I chiefly bear to say such words,"
11575,NINTH BOOK.,Because you cannot shame me with your eyes?
11576,NINTH BOOK.,"O calm, grand eyes, extinguished in a storm,"
11577,NINTH BOOK.,"Blown out like lights o’er melancholy seas,"
11578,NINTH BOOK.,"Though shrieked for by the shipwrecked,—O my Dark,"
11579,NINTH BOOK.,"My Cloud,—to go before me every day"
11580,NINTH BOOK.,"While I go ever toward the wilderness,—"
11581,NINTH BOOK.,I would that you could see me bare to the soul!—
11582,NINTH BOOK.,"If this be pity, ’tis so for myself,"
11583,NINTH BOOK.,And not for Romney: _he_ can stand alone;
11584,NINTH BOOK.,A man like _him_ is never overcome:
11585,NINTH BOOK.,"No woman like me, counts him pitiable"
11586,NINTH BOOK.,While saints applaud him. He mistook the world:
11587,NINTH BOOK.,"But I mistook my own heart,—and that slip"
11588,NINTH BOOK.,"Was fatal. Romney,—will you leave me here?"
11589,NINTH BOOK.,"So wrong, so proud, so weak, so unconsoled,"
11590,NINTH BOOK.,"So mere a woman!—and I love you so,—"
11591,NINTH BOOK.,"I love you, Romney.’"
11592,NINTH BOOK.,"Could I see his face,"
11593,NINTH BOOK.,"I wept so? Did I drop against his breast,"
11594,NINTH BOOK.,Or did his arms constrain me? Were my cheeks
11595,NINTH BOOK.,"Hot, overflooded, with my tears, or his?"
11596,NINTH BOOK.,And which of our two large explosive hearts
11597,NINTH BOOK.,"So shook me? That, I know not. There were words"
11598,NINTH BOOK.,"That broke in utterance ... melted, in the fire;"
11599,NINTH BOOK.,"Embrace, that was convulsion, ... then a kiss ..."
11600,NINTH BOOK.,"As long and silent as the ecstatic night,—And"
11601,NINTH BOOK.,"deep, deep, shuddering breaths, which meant beyond"
11602,NINTH BOOK.,Whatever could be told by word or kiss.
11603,NINTH BOOK.,
11604,NINTH BOOK.,"But what he said ... I have written day by day,"
11605,NINTH BOOK.,With somewhat even writing. Did I think
11606,NINTH BOOK.,That such a passionate rain would intercept
11607,NINTH BOOK.,"And dash this last page? What he said, indeed,"
11608,NINTH BOOK.,"I fain would write it down here like the rest,"
11609,NINTH BOOK.,"To keep it in my eyes, as in my ears,"
11610,NINTH BOOK.,"The heart’s sweet scripture, to be read at night"
11611,NINTH BOOK.,"When weary, or at morning when afraid,"
11612,NINTH BOOK.,And lean my heaviest oath on when I swear
11613,NINTH BOOK.,"That, when all’s done, all tried; all counted here,"
11614,NINTH BOOK.,"All great arts, and all good philosophies,—"
11615,NINTH BOOK.,"This love just puts its hand out in a dream,"
11616,NINTH BOOK.,And straight outreaches all things.
11617,NINTH BOOK.,"What he said,"
11618,NINTH BOOK.,I fain would write. But if an angel spoke
11619,NINTH BOOK.,"In thunder, should we, haply, know much more"
11620,NINTH BOOK.,Than that it thundered? If a cloud came down
11621,NINTH BOOK.,"And wrapt us wholly, could we draw its shape,"
11622,NINTH BOOK.,"As if on the outside, and not overcome?"
11623,NINTH BOOK.,And so he spake. His breath against my face
11624,NINTH BOOK.,"Confused his words, yet made them more intense,—"
11625,NINTH BOOK.,As when the sudden finder of the wind
11626,NINTH BOOK.,Will wipe a row of single city-lamps
11627,NINTH BOOK.,"To a pure white line of flame, more luminous"
11628,NINTH BOOK.,"Because of obliteration; more intense,—"
11629,NINTH BOOK.,The intimate presence carrying in itself
11630,NINTH BOOK.,"Complete communication, as with souls"
11631,NINTH BOOK.,"Who, having put the body off, perceive"
11632,NINTH BOOK.,"Through simply being. Thus, ’twas granted me"
11633,NINTH BOOK.,To know he loved me to the depth and height
11634,NINTH BOOK.,"Of such large natures, ever competent"
11635,NINTH BOOK.,"With grand horizons by the land or sea,"
11636,NINTH BOOK.,To love’s grand sunrise. Small spheres hold small fires:
11637,NINTH BOOK.,"But he loved largely, as a man can love"
11638,NINTH BOOK.,"Who, baffled in his love, dares live his life,"
11639,NINTH BOOK.,"Accept the ends which God loves, for his own,"
11640,NINTH BOOK.,And lift a constant aspect.
11641,NINTH BOOK.,From the day
11642,NINTH BOOK.,"I had brought to England my poor searching face,"
11643,NINTH BOOK.,(An orphan even of my father’s grave)
11644,NINTH BOOK.,"He had loved me, watched me, watched his soul in mine,"
11645,NINTH BOOK.,Which in me grew and heightened into love.
11646,NINTH BOOK.,"For he, a boy still, had been told the tale"
11647,NINTH BOOK.,"Of how a fairy bride from Italy,"
11648,NINTH BOOK.,"With smells of oleanders in her hair,"
11649,NINTH BOOK.,Was coming through the vines to touch his hand;
11650,NINTH BOOK.,Whereat the blood of boyhood on the palm
11651,NINTH BOOK.,"Made sudden heats. And when at last I came,"
11652,NINTH BOOK.,"And lived before him, lived, and rarely smiled,"
11653,NINTH BOOK.,"He smiled and loved me for the thing I was,"
11654,NINTH BOOK.,"As every child will love the year’s first flower,"
11655,NINTH BOOK.,"(Not certainly the fairest of the year,"
11656,NINTH BOOK.,"But, in which, the complete year seems to blow)"
11657,NINTH BOOK.,"The poor sad snowdrop,—growing between drifts,"
11658,NINTH BOOK.,"Mysterious medium ’twixt the plant and frost,"
11659,NINTH BOOK.,"So faint with winter while so quick with spring,"
11660,NINTH BOOK.,So doubtful if to thaw itself away
11661,NINTH BOOK.,With that snow near it. Not that Romney Leigh
11662,NINTH BOOK.,"Had loved me coldly. If I thought so once,"
11663,NINTH BOOK.,It was as if I had held my hand in fire
11664,NINTH BOOK.,And shook for cold. But now I understood
11665,NINTH BOOK.,"For ever, that the very fire and heat"
11666,NINTH BOOK.,"Of troubling passion in him, burned him clear,"
11667,NINTH BOOK.,"And shaped to dubious order, word and act:"
11668,NINTH BOOK.,"That, just because he loved me over all,"
11669,NINTH BOOK.,"All wealth, all lands, all social privilege,"
11670,NINTH BOOK.,"To which chance made him unexpected heir,—"
11671,NINTH BOOK.,"And, just because on all these lesser gifts,"
11672,NINTH BOOK.,Constrained by conscience and the sense of wrong
11673,NINTH BOOK.,He had stamped with steady hand God’s arrow-mark
11674,NINTH BOOK.,"Of dedication to the human need,"
11675,NINTH BOOK.,"He thought it should be so too, with his love;"
11676,NINTH BOOK.,"He, passionately loving, would bring down"
11677,NINTH BOOK.,"His love, his life, his best, (because the best)"
11678,NINTH BOOK.,"His bride of dreams, who walked so still and high"
11679,NINTH BOOK.,"Through flowery poems as through meadow-grass,"
11680,NINTH BOOK.,"The dust of golden lilies on her feet,"
11681,NINTH BOOK.,That _she_ should walk beside him on the rocks
11682,NINTH BOOK.,"In all that clang and hewing out of men,"
11683,NINTH BOOK.,"And help the work of help which was his life,"
11684,NINTH BOOK.,"And prove he kept back nothing,—not his soul."
11685,NINTH BOOK.,"And when I failed him,—for I failed him, I—"
11686,NINTH BOOK.,"And when it seemed he had missed my love,—he thought,"
11687,NINTH BOOK.,‘Aurora makes room for a working-noon;’
11688,NINTH BOOK.,"And so, self-girded with torn strips of hope,"
11689,NINTH BOOK.,"Took up his life, as if it were for death,"
11690,NINTH BOOK.,"(Just capable of one heroic aim,)"
11691,NINTH BOOK.,"And threw it in the thickest of the world,—"
11692,NINTH BOOK.,At which men laughed as if he had drowned a dog:
11693,NINTH BOOK.,"No wonder,—since Aurora failed him first!"
11694,NINTH BOOK.,The morning and the evening made his day.
11695,NINTH BOOK.,
11696,NINTH BOOK.,"But oh, the night! oh, bitter-sweet! oh, sweet!"
11697,NINTH BOOK.,"O dark, O moon and stars, O ecstasy"
11698,NINTH BOOK.,"Of darkness! O great mystery of love,—"
11699,NINTH BOOK.,"In which absorbed, loss, anguish, treason’s self"
11700,NINTH BOOK.,"Enlarges rapture,—as a pebble dropt"
11701,NINTH BOOK.,"In some full wine-cup, over-brims the wine!"
11702,NINTH BOOK.,"While we two sate together, leaned that night"
11703,NINTH BOOK.,"So close, my very garments crept and thrilled"
11704,NINTH BOOK.,With strange electric life; and both my cheeks
11705,NINTH BOOK.,"Grew red, then pale, with touches from my hair"
11706,NINTH BOOK.,In which his breath was; while the golden moon
11707,NINTH BOOK.,Was hung before our faces as the badge
11708,NINTH BOOK.,"Of some sublime inherited despair,"
11709,NINTH BOOK.,"Since ever to be seen by only one,—"
11710,NINTH BOOK.,"A voice said, low and rapid as a sigh,"
11711,NINTH BOOK.,"Yet breaking, I felt conscious, from a smile,—"
11712,NINTH BOOK.,"‘Thank God, who made me blind, to make me see!"
11713,NINTH BOOK.,"Shine on, Aurora, dearest light of souls,"
11714,NINTH BOOK.,Which rul’st for evermore both day and night!
11715,NINTH BOOK.,I am happy.’
11716,NINTH BOOK.,"I flung closer to his breast,"
11717,NINTH BOOK.,"As sword that, after battle, flings to sheathe;"
11718,NINTH BOOK.,"And, in that hurtle of united souls,"
11719,NINTH BOOK.,The mystic motions which in common moods
11720,NINTH BOOK.,"Are shut beyond our sense, broke in on us,"
11721,NINTH BOOK.,"And, as we sate, we felt the old earth spin,"
11722,NINTH BOOK.,And all the starry turbulence of worlds
11723,NINTH BOOK.,"Swing round us in their audient circles, till"
11724,NINTH BOOK.,If that same golden moon were overhead
11725,NINTH BOOK.,"Or if beneath our feet, we did not know."
11726,NINTH BOOK.,
11727,NINTH BOOK.,"And then calm, equal, smooth with weights of joy,"
11728,NINTH BOOK.,"His voice rose, as some chief musician’s song"
11729,NINTH BOOK.,"Amid the old Jewish temple’s Selah-pause,"
11730,NINTH BOOK.,And bade me mark how we two met at last
11731,NINTH BOOK.,"Upon this moon-bathed promontory of earth,"
11732,NINTH BOOK.,"To give up much on each side, then take all."
11733,NINTH BOOK.,"‘Beloved,’ it sang, ‘we must be here to work;"
11734,NINTH BOOK.,"And men who work, can only work for men,"
11735,NINTH BOOK.,"And, not to work in vain, must comprehend"
11736,NINTH BOOK.,"Humanity, and, so, work humanly,"
11737,NINTH BOOK.,"And raise men’s bodies still by raising souls,"
11738,NINTH BOOK.,"As God did, first.’"
11739,NINTH BOOK.,"‘But stand upon the earth,’"
11740,NINTH BOOK.,"I said, ‘to raise them,—(this is human too;"
11741,NINTH BOOK.,There’s nothing high which has not first been low;
11742,NINTH BOOK.,"My humbleness, said One, has made me great!)"
11743,NINTH BOOK.,"As God did, last.’"
11744,NINTH BOOK.,"‘And work all silently,"
11745,NINTH BOOK.,"And simply,’ he returned, ‘as God does all;"
11746,NINTH BOOK.,"Distort our nature never, for our work,"
11747,NINTH BOOK.,Nor count our right hands stronger for being hoofs.
11748,NINTH BOOK.,"The man most man, with tenderest human hands,"
11749,NINTH BOOK.,"Works best for men,—as God in Nazareth.’"
11750,NINTH BOOK.,
11751,NINTH BOOK.,"He paused upon the word, and then resumed;"
11752,NINTH BOOK.,‘Fewer programmes; we who have no prescience.
11753,NINTH BOOK.,Fewer systems; we who are held and do not hold.
11754,NINTH BOOK.,"Less mapping out of masses, to be saved,"
11755,NINTH BOOK.,"By nations or by sexes. Fourier’s void,"
11756,NINTH BOOK.,"And Comte is dwarfed,—and Cabet, puerile."
11757,NINTH BOOK.,Subsists no law of life outside of life;
11758,NINTH BOOK.,"No perfect manners, without Christian souls:"
11759,NINTH BOOK.,"The Christ himself had been no Lawgiver,"
11760,NINTH BOOK.,"Unless He had given the life, too, with the law.’"
11761,NINTH BOOK.,
11762,NINTH BOOK.,"I echoed thoughtfully—‘The man, most man,"
11763,NINTH BOOK.,"Works best for men: and, if most man indeed,"
11764,NINTH BOOK.,He gets his manhood plainest from his soul:
11765,NINTH BOOK.,"While, obviously, this stringent soul itself"
11766,NINTH BOOK.,Obeys our old rules of development;
11767,NINTH BOOK.,"The Spirit ever witnessing in ours,"
11768,NINTH BOOK.,"And Love, the soul of soul, within the soul,"
11769,NINTH BOOK.,"Evolving it sublimely. First, God’s love.’"
11770,NINTH BOOK.,
11771,NINTH BOOK.,"‘And next,’ he smiled, ‘the love of wedded souls,"
11772,NINTH BOOK.,Which still presents that mystery’s counterpart.
11773,NINTH BOOK.,"Sweet shadow-rose, upon the water of life,"
11774,NINTH BOOK.,"Of such a mystic substance, Sharon gave"
11775,NINTH BOOK.,"A name to! human, vital, fructuous rose,"
11776,NINTH BOOK.,"Whose calyx holds the multitude of leaves,—"
11777,NINTH BOOK.,"Loves filial, loves fraternal, neighbour-loves,"
11778,NINTH BOOK.,"And civic, ... all fair petals, all good scents,"
11779,NINTH BOOK.,"All reddened, sweetened from one central Heart!’"
11780,NINTH BOOK.,
11781,NINTH BOOK.,"‘Alas,’ I cried, ‘it was not long ago,"
11782,NINTH BOOK.,You swore this very social rose smelt ill.’
11783,NINTH BOOK.,
11784,NINTH BOOK.,"‘Alas,’ he answered, ‘is it a rose at all?"
11785,NINTH BOOK.,"The filial’s thankless, the fraternal’s hard,"
11786,NINTH BOOK.,"The rest is lost. I do but stand and think,"
11787,NINTH BOOK.,Across dim waters of a troubled life
11788,NINTH BOOK.,"The Flower of Heaven so vainly overhangs,—"
11789,NINTH BOOK.,"What perfect counterpart would be in sight,"
11790,NINTH BOOK.,"If tanks were clearer. Let us clean the tubes,"
11791,NINTH BOOK.,"And wait for rains. O poet, O my love,"
11792,NINTH BOOK.,"Since _I_ was too ambitious in my deed,"
11793,NINTH BOOK.,"And thought to distance all men in success,"
11794,NINTH BOOK.,"Till God came on me, marked the place, and said,"
11795,NINTH BOOK.,"‘Ill-doer, henceforth keep within this line,"
11796,NINTH BOOK.,"Attempting less than others,’—and I stand"
11797,NINTH BOOK.,"And work among Christ’s little ones, content,—"
11798,NINTH BOOK.,"Come thou, my compensation, my dear sight,"
11799,NINTH BOOK.,"My morning-star, my morning! rise and shine,"
11800,NINTH BOOK.,And touch my hills with radiance not their own;
11801,NINTH BOOK.,"Shine out for two, Aurora, and fulfil"
11802,NINTH BOOK.,"My falling-short that must be! work for two,"
11803,NINTH BOOK.,"As I, though thus restrained, for two, shall love!"
11804,NINTH BOOK.,"Gaze on, with inscient vision toward the sun,"
11805,NINTH BOOK.,"And, from his visceral heat, pluck out the roots"
11806,NINTH BOOK.,"Of light beyond him. Art’s a service,—mark:"
11807,NINTH BOOK.,"A silver key is given to thy clasp,"
11808,NINTH BOOK.,"And thou shalt stand unwearied, night and day,"
11809,NINTH BOOK.,"And fix it in the hard, slow-turning wards,"
11810,NINTH BOOK.,"And open, so, that intermediate door"
11811,NINTH BOOK.,Betwixt the different planes of sensuous form
11812,NINTH BOOK.,"And form insensuous, that inferior men"
11813,NINTH BOOK.,"May learn to feel on still through these to those,"
11814,NINTH BOOK.,And bless thy ministration. The world waits
11815,NINTH BOOK.,"For help. Beloved, let us love so well,"
11816,NINTH BOOK.,"Our work shall still be better for our love,"
11817,NINTH BOOK.,"And still our love be sweeter for our work,"
11818,NINTH BOOK.,"And both, commended, for the sake of each,"
11819,NINTH BOOK.,By all true workers and true lovers born.
11820,NINTH BOOK.,Now press the clarion on thy woman’s lip
11821,NINTH BOOK.,(Love’s holy kiss shall still keep consecrate)
11822,NINTH BOOK.,"And breathe the fine keen breath along the brass,"
11823,NINTH BOOK.,And blow all class-walls level as Jericho’s
11824,NINTH BOOK.,"Past Jordan; crying from the top of souls,"
11825,NINTH BOOK.,"To souls, that they assemble on earth’s flats"
11826,NINTH BOOK.,To get them to some purer eminence
11827,NINTH BOOK.,Than any hitherto beheld for clouds!
11828,NINTH BOOK.,"What height we know not,—but the way we know,"
11829,NINTH BOOK.,"And how by mounting aye, we must attain,"
11830,NINTH BOOK.,And so climb on. It is the hour for souls;
11831,NINTH BOOK.,"That bodies, leavened by the will and love,"
11832,NINTH BOOK.,Be lightened to redemption. The world’s old;
11833,NINTH BOOK.,But the old world waits the hour to be renewed:
11834,NINTH BOOK.,"Toward which, new hearts in individual growth"
11835,NINTH BOOK.,"Must quicken, and increase to multitude"
11836,NINTH BOOK.,"In new dynasties of the race of men,—"
11837,NINTH BOOK.,"Developed whence, shall grow spontaneously"
11838,NINTH BOOK.,"New churches, new œconomies, new laws"
11839,NINTH BOOK.,"Admitting freedom, new societies"
